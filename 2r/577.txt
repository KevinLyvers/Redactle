the, german, empire, german, deutsches, reich, also, referred, to, as, imperial, germany, the, second, reich, or, simply, germany, was, the, period, of, the, german, reich, from, the, unification, of, germany, in, 1871, until, the, november, revolution, in, 1918, when, the, german, reich, changed, its, form, of, government, from, a, monarchy, to, a, republic, the, empire, was, founded, on, 18, january, 1871, at, the, palace, of, versailles, outside, paris, france, where, the, south, german, states, except, for, austria, and, liechtenstein, joined, the, north, german, confederation, and, the, new, constitution, came, into, force, on, 16, april, changing, the, name, of, the, federal, state, to, the, german, empire, and, introducing, the, title, of, german, emperor, for, wilhelm, i, king, of, prussia, from, the, house, of, hohenzollern, berlin, remained, its, capital, and, otto, von, bismarck, minister, president, of, prussia, became, chancellor, the, head, of, government, as, these, events, occurred, the, prussian, led, north, german, confederation, and, its, southern, german, allies, such, as, baden, bavaria, w, rttemberg, and, hesse, were, still, engaged, in, the, franco, prussian, war, the, german, empire, consisted, of, 25, states, each, with, its, own, nobility, four, constituent, kingdoms, six, grand, duchies, five, duchies, six, before, 1876, seven, principalities, three, free, hanseatic, cities, and, one, imperial, territory, while, prussia, was, one, of, four, kingdoms, in, the, realm, it, contained, about, two, thirds, of, the, empire, s, population, and, territory, and, prussian, dominance, was, also, constitutionally, established, since, the, king, of, prussia, was, also, the, german, emperor, deutscher, kaiser, after, 1850, the, states, of, germany, had, rapidly, become, industrialized, with, particular, strengths, in, coal, iron, and, later, steel, chemicals, and, railways, in, 1871, germany, had, a, population, of, 41, million, people, by, 1913, this, had, increased, to, 68, million, a, heavily, rural, collection, of, states, in, 1815, the, now, united, germany, became, predominantly, urban, the, success, of, german, industrialization, manifested, itself, in, two, ways, in, the, early, 20th, century, german, factories, were, often, larger, and, more, modern, than, many, of, their, british, and, french, counterparts, but, the, preindustrial, sector, was, more, backward, the, success, of, the, german, empire, in, the, natural, sciences, especially, in, physics, and, chemistry, was, such, that, one, third, of, all, nobel, prizes, went, to, german, inventors, and, researchers, during, its, 47, years, of, existence, the, german, empire, became, an, industrial, technological, and, scientific, power, in, europe, and, by, 1913, germany, was, the, largest, economy, in, continental, europe, and, the, third, largest, in, the, world, germany, also, became, a, great, power, building, the, longest, railway, network, of, europe, the, world, s, strongest, army, and, a, fast, growing, industrial, base, starting, very, small, in, 1871, in, a, decade, the, navy, became, second, only, to, britain, s, royal, navy, from, 1871, to, 1890, otto, von, bismarck, s, tenure, as, the, first, and, to, this, day, longest, serving, chancellor, was, marked, by, relative, liberalism, at, its, start, but, in, time, grew, more, conservative, broad, reforms, the, anti, catholic, kulturkampf, and, systematic, repression, of, polish, people, marked, his, period, in, the, office, despite, his, hatred, of, liberalism, and, socialism, he, called, liberals, and, socialists, enemies, of, the, reich, social, programs, introduced, by, bismarck, included, old, age, pensions, accident, insurance, medical, care, and, unemployment, insurance, all, aspects, of, the, modern, european, welfare, state, late, in, bismarck, s, chancellorship, and, in, spite, of, his, earlier, personal, opposition, germany, became, involved, in, colonialism, claiming, much, of, the, leftover, territory, that, was, not, yet, conquered, by, europeans, in, the, scramble, for, africa, it, managed, to, build, the, third, largest, colonial, empire, at, the, time, after, the, british, and, the, french, ones, as, a, colonial, state, it, sometimes, clashed, with, the, interests, of, other, european, powers, especially, the, british, empire, during, its, colonial, expansion, the, german, empire, committed, the, herero, and, namaqua, genocide, after, the, resignation, of, otto, von, bismarck, in, 1890, and, wilhelm, ii, s, refusal, to, recall, him, to, office, the, empire, embarked, on, weltpolitik, world, politics, a, bellicose, new, course, that, ultimately, contributed, to, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, bismarck, s, successors, were, incapable, of, maintaining, their, predecessor, s, complex, shifting, and, overlapping, alliances, which, had, kept, germany, from, being, diplomatically, isolated, this, period, was, marked, by, increased, oppression, of, polish, people, and, various, factors, influencing, the, emperor, s, decisions, which, were, often, perceived, as, contradictory, or, unpredictable, by, the, public, in, 1879, the, german, empire, consolidated, the, dual, alliance, with, austria, hungary, followed, by, the, triple, alliance, with, italy, in, 1882, it, also, retained, strong, diplomatic, ties, to, the, ottoman, empire, when, the, great, crisis, of, 1914, arrived, italy, left, the, alliance, and, the, ottoman, empire, formally, allied, with, germany, in, the, first, world, war, german, plans, to, capture, paris, quickly, in, the, autumn, of, 1914, failed, and, the, war, on, the, western, front, became, a, stalemate, the, allied, naval, blockade, caused, severe, shortages, of, food, and, supplements, however, imperial, germany, had, success, on, the, eastern, front, it, occupied, a, large, amount, of, territory, to, its, east, following, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, the, german, declaration, of, unrestricted, submarine, warfare, in, early, 1917, contributed, to, bringing, the, united, states, into, the, war, in, october, 1918, after, the, failed, spring, offensive, the, german, armies, were, in, retreat, allies, austria, hungary, and, the, ottoman, empire, had, collapsed, and, bulgaria, had, surrendered, the, empire, collapsed, in, the, november, 1918, revolution, with, the, abdication, of, wilhelm, ii, which, left, the, post, war, federal, republic, to, govern, a, devastated, populace, the, treaty, of, versailles, imposed, post, war, reparation, costs, of, 132, billion, gold, marks, around, us, 269, billion, or, 240, billion, in, 2019, or, roughly, us, 32, billion, in, 1921, as, well, as, limiting, the, army, to, 100, 000, men, and, disallowing, conscription, armored, vehicles, submarines, aircraft, and, more, than, six, battleships, the, consequential, economic, devastation, later, exacerbated, by, the, great, depression, as, well, as, humiliation, and, outrage, experienced, by, the, german, population, are, considered, leading, factors, in, the, rise, of, adolf, hitler, and, nazism, the, german, confederation, had, been, created, by, an, act, of, the, congress, of, vienna, on, 8, june, 1815, as, a, result, of, the, napoleonic, wars, after, being, alluded, to, in, article, 6, of, the, 1814, treaty, of, paris, the, liberal, revolutions, of, 1848, were, crushed, after, the, relations, between, the, educated, well, off, middle, class, liberals, and, the, urban, artisans, broke, down, otto, von, bismarck, s, pragmatic, realpolitik, which, appealed, to, peasants, as, well, as, the, aristocracy, took, its, place, bismarck, sought, to, extend, hohenzollern, hegemony, throughout, the, german, states, to, do, so, meant, unification, of, the, german, states, and, the, exclusion, of, prussia, s, main, german, rival, austria, from, the, subsequent, german, empire, he, envisioned, a, conservative, prussian, dominated, germany, the, second, schleswig, war, against, denmark, in, 1864, the, austro, prussian, war, in, 1866, and, the, franco, prussian, war, in, 1870, 1871, sparked, a, growing, pan, german, ideal, and, contributed, to, the, formation, of, the, german, state, the, german, confederation, ended, as, a, result, of, the, austro, prussian, war, of, 1866, between, the, constituent, confederation, entities, of, the, austrian, empire, and, its, allies, on, one, side, and, prussia, and, its, allies, on, the, other, the, war, resulted, in, the, partial, replacement, of, the, confederation, in, 1867, by, a, north, german, confederation, comprising, the, 22, states, north, of, the, river, main, the, patriotic, fervor, generated, by, the, franco, prussian, war, of, 1870, overwhelmed, the, remaining, opposition, to, a, unified, germany, aside, from, austria, in, the, four, states, south, of, the, main, and, during, november, 1870, they, joined, the, north, german, confederation, by, treaty, on, 10, december, 1870, the, north, german, confederation, reichstag, renamed, the, confederation, the, german, empire, and, gave, the, title, of, german, emperor, to, william, i, the, king, of, prussia, as, bundespr, sidium, of, the, confederation, the, new, constitution, constitution, of, the, german, confederation, and, the, title, emperor, came, into, effect, on, 1, january, 1871, during, the, siege, of, paris, on, 18, january, 1871, william, was, proclaimed, emperor, in, the, hall, of, mirrors, at, the, palace, of, versailles, the, second, german, constitution, adopted, by, the, reichstag, on, 14, april, 1871, and, proclaimed, by, the, emperor, on, 16, april, was, substantially, based, upon, bismarck, s, north, german, constitution, the, political, system, remained, the, same, the, empire, had, a, parliament, called, the, reichstag, which, was, elected, by, universal, male, suffrage, however, the, original, constituencies, drawn, in, 1871, were, never, redrawn, to, reflect, the, growth, of, urban, areas, as, a, result, by, the, time, of, the, great, expansion, of, german, cities, in, the, 1890s, and, 1900s, rural, areas, were, grossly, over, represented, the, legislation, also, required, the, consent, of, the, bundesrat, the, federal, council, of, deputies, from, the, 27, states, executive, power, was, vested, in, the, emperor, or, kaiser, who, was, assisted, by, a, chancellor, responsible, only, to, him, the, emperor, was, given, extensive, powers, by, the, constitution, he, alone, appointed, and, dismissed, the, chancellor, so, in, practice, the, emperor, ruled, the, empire, through, the, chancellor, was, supreme, commander, in, chief, of, the, armed, forces, and, final, arbiter, of, all, foreign, affairs, and, could, also, disband, the, reichstag, to, call, for, new, elections, officially, the, chancellor, was, a, one, man, cabinet, and, was, responsible, for, the, conduct, of, all, state, affairs, in, practice, the, state, secretaries, top, bureaucratic, officials, in, charge, of, such, fields, as, finance, war, foreign, affairs, etc, functioned, much, like, ministers, in, other, monarchies, the, reichstag, had, the, power, to, pass, amend, or, reject, bills, and, to, initiate, legislation, however, as, mentioned, above, in, practice, the, real, power, was, vested, in, the, emperor, who, exercised, it, through, his, chancellor, although, nominally, a, federal, empire, and, league, of, equals, in, practice, the, empire, was, dominated, by, the, largest, and, most, powerful, state, prussia, it, stretched, across, the, northern, two, thirds, of, the, new, reich, and, contained, three, fifths, of, the, country, s, population, the, imperial, crown, was, hereditary, in, the, ruling, house, of, prussia, the, house, of, hohenzollern, with, the, exception, of, 1872, 1873, and, 1892, 1894, the, chancellor, was, always, simultaneously, the, prime, minister, of, prussia, with, 17, out, of, 58, votes, in, the, bundesrat, berlin, needed, only, a, few, votes, from, the, smaller, states, to, exercise, effective, control, the, other, states, retained, their, own, governments, but, had, only, limited, aspects, of, sovereignty, for, example, both, postage, stamps, and, currency, were, issued, for, the, empire, as, a, whole, coins, through, one, mark, were, also, minted, in, the, name, of, the, empire, while, higher, valued, pieces, were, issued, by, the, states, however, these, larger, gold, and, silver, issues, were, virtually, commemorative, coins, and, had, limited, circulation, while, the, states, issued, their, own, decorations, and, some, had, their, own, armies, the, military, forces, of, the, smaller, ones, were, put, under, prussian, control, those, of, the, larger, states, such, as, the, kingdoms, of, bavaria, and, saxony, were, coordinated, along, prussian, principles, and, would, in, wartime, be, controlled, by, the, federal, government, the, evolution, of, the, german, empire, is, somewhat, in, line, with, parallel, developments, in, italy, which, became, a, united, nation, state, a, decade, earlier, some, key, elements, of, the, german, empire, s, authoritarian, political, structure, were, also, the, basis, for, conservative, modernization, in, imperial, japan, under, emperor, meiji, and, the, preservation, of, an, authoritarian, political, structure, under, the, tsars, in, the, russian, empire, one, factor, in, the, social, anatomy, of, these, governments, was, the, retention, of, a, very, substantial, share, in, political, power, by, the, landed, elite, the, junkers, resulting, from, the, absence, of, a, revolutionary, breakthrough, by, the, peasants, in, combination, with, urban, areas, although, authoritarian, in, many, respects, the, empire, had, some, democratic, features, besides, universal, manhood, suffrage, it, permitted, the, development, of, political, parties, bismarck, intended, to, create, a, constitutional, fa, ade, that, would, mask, the, continuation, of, authoritarian, policies, however, in, the, process, he, created, a, system, with, a, serious, flaw, there, was, a, significant, disparity, between, the, prussian, and, german, electoral, systems, prussia, used, a, three, class, voting, system, which, weighted, votes, based, on, the, amount, of, taxes, paid, all, but, assuring, a, conservative, majority, the, king, and, with, two, exceptions, the, prime, minister, of, prussia, were, also, the, emperor, and, chancellor, of, the, empire, meaning, that, the, same, rulers, had, to, seek, majorities, from, legislatures, elected, from, completely, different, franchises, universal, suffrage, was, significantly, diluted, by, gross, over, representation, of, rural, areas, from, the, 1890s, onward, by, the, turn, of, the, century, the, urban, rural, population, balance, was, completely, reversed, from, 1871, more, than, two, thirds, of, the, empire, s, people, lived, in, cities, and, towns, bismarck, s, domestic, policies, played, an, important, role, in, forging, the, authoritarian, political, culture, of, the, kaiserreich, less, preoccupied, with, continental, power, politics, following, unification, in, 1871, germany, s, semi, parliamentary, government, carried, out, a, relatively, smooth, economic, and, political, revolution, from, above, that, pushed, them, along, the, way, towards, becoming, the, world, s, leading, industrial, power, of, the, time, bismarck, s, revolutionary, conservatism, was, a, conservative, state, building, strategy, designed, to, make, ordinary, germans, not, just, the, junker, elite, more, loyal, to, the, throne, and, empire, according, to, kees, van, kersbergen, and, barbara, vis, his, strategy, was, granting, social, rights, to, enhance, the, integration, of, a, hierarchical, society, to, forge, a, bond, between, workers, and, the, state, so, as, to, strengthen, the, latter, to, maintain, traditional, relations, of, authority, between, social, and, status, groups, and, to, provide, a, countervailing, power, against, the, modernist, forces, of, liberalism, and, socialism, bismarck, created, the, modern, welfare, state, in, germany, in, the, 1880s, and, enacted, universal, male, suffrage, in, 1871, he, became, a, great, hero, to, german, conservatives, who, erected, many, monuments, to, his, memory, and, tried, to, emulate, his, policies, bismarck, s, post, 1871, foreign, policy, was, conservative, and, sought, to, preserve, the, balance, of, power, in, europe, british, historian, eric, hobsbawm, concludes, that, he, remained, undisputed, world, champion, at, the, game, of, multilateral, diplomatic, chess, for, almost, twenty, years, after, 1871, himself, exclusively, and, successfully, to, maintaining, peace, between, the, powers, this, was, a, departure, from, his, adventurous, foreign, policy, for, prussia, where, he, favored, strength, and, expansion, punctuating, this, by, saying, the, great, questions, of, the, age, are, not, settled, by, speeches, and, majority, votes, this, was, the, error, of, 1848, 49, but, by, iron, and, blood, bismarck, s, chief, concern, was, that, france, would, plot, revenge, after, its, defeat, in, the, franco, prussian, war, as, the, french, lacked, the, strength, to, defeat, germany, by, themselves, they, sought, an, alliance, with, russia, or, perhaps, even, the, newly, reformed, empire, of, austria, hungary, which, would, envelope, germany, completely, bismarck, wanted, to, prevent, this, at, all, costs, and, maintain, friendly, relations, with, the, austrians, and, the, russians, signing, the, dual, alliance, 1879, with, austria, hungary, in, 1879, the, dual, aliance, was, a, defensive, alliance, that, was, established, against, russia, and, by, association, france, in, the, event, alliance, did, not, work, out, with, the, state, however, an, alliance, with, russia, would, come, not, long, after, the, signing, of, the, dual, alliance, with, austria, the, dreikaiserbund, league, of, three, emperors, in, 1881, during, this, period, individuals, within, the, german, military, were, advocating, a, preemptive, strike, against, russia, but, bismarck, knew, that, such, ideas, were, foolhardy, he, once, wrote, that, the, most, brilliant, victories, would, not, avail, against, the, russian, nation, because, of, its, climate, its, desert, and, its, frugality, and, having, but, one, frontier, to, defend, and, because, it, would, leave, germany, with, another, bitter, resentful, neighbor, despite, this, another, alliance, between, germany, austria, hungary, and, italy, would, be, signed, in, 1882, preying, on, the, fears, of, the, german, and, austro, hungarian, militaries, of, the, untrustworthiness, of, russia, itself, this, alliance, named, the, triple, alliance, 1882, would, exist, up, until, 1915, when, italy, declared, war, on, austria, hungary, despite, germany, and, especially, austria, s, lack, of, faith, in, the, russian, alliance, the, reinsurance, treaty, would, be, first, signed, in, 1887, and, renewed, up, until, 1890, when, the, bismarckian, system, collapsed, upon, bismarck, s, resignation, meanwhile, the, chancellor, remained, wary, of, any, foreign, policy, developments, that, looked, even, remotely, warlike, in, 1886, he, moved, to, stop, an, attempted, sale, of, horses, to, france, because, they, might, be, used, for, cavalry, and, also, ordered, an, investigation, into, large, russian, purchases, of, medicine, from, a, german, chemical, works, bismarck, stubbornly, refused, to, listen, to, georg, herbert, m, nster, ambassador, to, france, who, reported, back, that, the, french, were, not, seeking, a, revanchist, war, and, were, desperate, for, peace, at, all, costs, bismarck, and, most, of, his, contemporaries, were, conservative, minded, and, focused, their, foreign, policy, attention, on, germany, s, neighboring, states, in, 1914, 60, of, german, foreign, investment, was, in, europe, as, opposed, to, just, 5, of, british, investment, most, of, the, money, went, to, developing, nations, such, as, russia, that, lacked, the, capital, or, technical, knowledge, to, industrialize, on, their, own, the, construction, of, the, berlin, baghdad, railway, financed, by, german, banks, was, designed, to, eventually, connect, germany, with, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, persian, gulf, but, it, also, collided, with, british, and, russian, geopolitical, interests, conflict, over, the, baghdad, railway, was, resolved, in, june, 1914, many, consider, bismarck, s, foreign, policy, as, a, coherent, system, and, partly, responsible, for, the, preservation, of, europe, s, stability, it, was, also, marked, by, the, need, to, balance, circumspect, defensiveness, and, the, desire, to, be, free, from, the, constraints, of, its, position, as, a, major, european, power, bismarck, s, successors, did, not, pursue, his, foreign, policy, legacy, for, instance, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, who, dismissed, the, chancellor, in, 1890, let, the, treaty, with, russia, lapse, in, favor, of, germany, s, alliance, with, austria, which, finally, led, to, a, stronger, coalition, building, between, russia, and, france, germans, had, dreamed, of, colonial, imperialism, since, 1848, although, bismarck, had, little, interest, in, acquiring, overseas, possessions, most, germans, were, enthusiastic, and, by, 1884, he, had, acquired, german, new, guinea, by, the, 1890s, german, colonial, expansion, in, asia, and, the, pacific, jiaozhou, bay, and, tianjin, in, china, the, marianas, the, caroline, islands, samoa, led, to, frictions, with, the, uk, russia, japan, and, the, us, the, largest, colonial, enterprises, were, in, africa, where, the, herero, wars, in, what, is, now, namibia, in, 1906, 1907, resulted, in, the, herero, and, namaqua, genocide, by, 1900, germany, became, the, largest, economy, in, continental, europe, and, the, third, largest, in, the, world, behind, the, united, states, and, the, british, empire, which, were, also, its, main, economic, rivals, throughout, its, existence, it, experienced, economic, growth, and, modernization, led, by, heavy, industry, in, 1871, it, had, a, largely, rural, population, of, 41, million, while, by, 1913, this, had, increased, to, a, predominantly, urban, population, of, 68, million, for, 30, years, germany, struggled, against, britain, to, be, europe, s, leading, industrial, power, representative, of, germany, s, industry, was, the, steel, giant, krupp, whose, first, factory, was, built, in, essen, by, 1902, the, factory, alone, became, a, great, city, with, its, own, streets, its, own, police, force, fire, department, and, traffic, laws, there, are, 150, kilometers, of, rail, 60, different, factory, buildings, 8, 500, machine, tools, seven, electrical, stations, 140, kilometers, of, underground, cable, and, 46, overhead, under, bismarck, germany, was, a, world, innovator, in, building, the, welfare, state, german, workers, enjoyed, health, accident, and, maternity, benefits, canteens, changing, rooms, and, a, national, pension, scheme, industrialisation, progressed, dynamically, in, germany, and, german, manufacturers, began, to, capture, domestic, markets, from, british, imports, and, also, to, compete, with, british, industry, abroad, particularly, in, the, u, s, the, german, textile, and, metal, industries, had, by, 1870, surpassed, those, of, britain, in, organisation, and, technical, efficiency, and, superseded, british, manufacturers, in, the, domestic, market, germany, became, the, dominant, economic, power, on, the, continent, and, was, the, second, largest, exporting, nation, after, britain, technological, progress, during, german, industrialisation, occurred, in, four, waves, the, railway, wave, 1877, 1886, the, dye, wave, 1887, 1896, the, chemical, wave, 1897, 1902, and, the, wave, of, electrical, engineering, 1903, 1918, since, germany, industrialised, later, than, britain, it, was, able, to, model, its, factories, after, those, of, britain, thus, making, more, efficient, use, of, its, capital, and, avoiding, legacy, methods, in, its, leap, to, the, envelope, of, technology, germany, invested, more, heavily, than, the, british, in, research, especially, in, chemistry, ice, engines, and, electricity, germany, s, dominance, in, physics, and, chemistry, was, such, that, one, third, of, all, nobel, prizes, went, to, german, inventors, and, researchers, the, german, cartel, system, known, as, konzerne, being, significantly, concentrated, was, able, to, make, more, efficient, use, of, capital, germany, was, not, weighted, down, with, an, expensive, worldwide, empire, that, needed, defense, following, germany, s, annexation, of, alsace, lorraine, in, 1871, it, absorbed, parts, of, what, had, been, france, s, industrial, base, germany, overtook, british, steel, production, in, 1893, and, pig, iron, production, in, 1903, the, german, steel, and, pig, iron, production, continued, its, rapid, expansion, between, 1911, and, 1913, the, german, steel, and, pig, iron, output, reached, one, quarter, of, total, global, production, german, factories, were, larger, and, more, modern, than, their, british, and, french, counterparts, by, 1913, the, german, electricity, production, was, higher, than, the, combined, electricity, production, of, britain, france, italy, and, sweden, by, 1900, the, german, chemical, industry, dominated, the, world, market, for, synthetic, dyes, the, three, major, firms, basf, bayer, and, hoechst, produced, several, hundred, different, dyes, along, with, the, five, smaller, firms, imperial, germany, built, up, the, world, s, largest, chemical, industry, the, production, of, german, chemical, industry, was, 60, higher, than, that, of, the, united, states, in, 1913, these, eight, firms, produced, almost, 90, of, the, world, supply, of, dyestuffs, and, sold, about, 80, of, their, production, abroad, the, three, major, firms, had, also, integrated, upstream, into, the, production, of, essential, raw, materials, and, they, began, to, expand, into, other, areas, of, chemistry, such, as, pharmaceuticals, photographic, film, agricultural, chemicals, and, electrochemicals, top, level, decision, making, was, in, the, hands, of, professional, salaried, managers, leading, chandler, to, call, the, german, dye, companies, the, world, s, first, truly, managerial, industrial, enterprises, there, were, many, spinoffs, from, research, such, as, the, pharmaceutical, industry, which, emerged, from, chemical, research, by, the, start, of, world, war, i, 1914, 1918, german, industry, switched, to, war, production, the, heaviest, demands, were, on, coal, and, steel, for, artillery, and, shell, production, and, on, chemicals, for, the, synthesis, of, materials, that, were, subject, to, import, restrictions, and, for, chemical, weapons, and, war, supplies, lacking, a, technological, base, at, first, the, germans, imported, their, engineering, and, hardware, from, britain, but, quickly, learned, the, skills, needed, to, operate, and, expand, the, railways, in, many, cities, the, new, railway, shops, were, the, centers, of, technological, awareness, and, training, so, that, by, 1850, germany, was, self, sufficient, in, meeting, the, demands, of, railroad, construction, and, the, railways, were, a, major, impetus, for, the, growth, of, the, new, steel, industry, german, unification, in, 1870, stimulated, consolidation, nationalisation, into, state, owned, companies, and, further, rapid, growth, unlike, the, situation, in, france, the, goal, was, support, of, industrialisation, and, so, heavy, lines, crisscrossed, the, ruhr, and, other, industrial, districts, and, provided, good, connections, to, the, major, ports, of, hamburg, and, bremen, by, 1880, germany, had, 9, 400, locomotives, pulling, 43, 000, passengers, and, 30, 000, tons, of, freight, and, forged, ahead, of, france, the, total, length, of, german, railroad, tracks, expanded, from, 21, 000, km, 13, 000, mi, in, 1871, to, 63, 000, km, 39, 000, mi, by, 1913, establishing, the, largest, rail, network, in, the, world, after, the, united, states, the, german, rail, network, was, followed, by, austria, hungary, 43, 280, km, 26, 890, mi, france, 40, 770, km, 25, 330, mi, the, united, kingdom, 32, 623, km, 20, 271, mi, italy, 18, 873, km, 11, 727, mi, and, spain, 15, 088, km, 9, 375, mi, the, creation, of, the, empire, under, prussian, leadership, was, a, victory, for, the, concept, of, kleindeutschland, smaller, germany, over, the, gro, deutschland, concept, this, meant, that, austria, hungary, a, multi, ethnic, empire, with, a, considerable, german, speaking, population, would, remain, outside, of, the, german, nation, state, bismarck, s, policy, was, to, pursue, a, solution, diplomatically, the, effective, alliance, between, germany, and, austria, played, a, major, role, in, germany, s, decision, to, enter, world, war, i, in, 1914, bismarck, announced, there, would, be, no, more, territorial, additions, to, germany, in, europe, and, his, diplomacy, after, 1871, was, focused, on, stabilizing, the, european, system, and, preventing, any, wars, he, succeeded, and, only, after, his, departure, from, office, in, 1890, did, the, diplomatic, tensions, start, rising, again, after, achieving, formal, unification, in, 1871, bismarck, devoted, much, of, his, attention, to, the, cause, of, national, unity, he, opposed, catholic, civil, rights, and, emancipation, especially, the, influence, of, the, vatican, under, pope, pius, ix, and, working, class, radicalism, represented, by, the, emerging, social, democratic, party, prussia, in, 1871, included, 16, 000, 000, protestants, both, reformed, and, lutheran, and, 8, 000, 000, catholics, most, people, were, generally, segregated, into, their, own, religious, worlds, living, in, rural, districts, or, city, neighbourhoods, that, were, overwhelmingly, of, the, same, religion, and, sending, their, children, to, separate, public, schools, where, their, religion, was, taught, there, was, little, interaction, or, intermarriage, on, the, whole, the, protestants, had, a, higher, social, status, and, the, catholics, were, more, likely, to, be, peasant, farmers, or, unskilled, or, semiskilled, industrial, workers, in, 1870, the, catholics, formed, their, own, political, party, the, centre, party, which, generally, supported, unification, and, most, of, bismarck, s, policies, however, bismarck, distrusted, parliamentary, democracy, in, general, and, opposition, parties, in, particular, especially, when, the, centre, party, showed, signs, of, gaining, support, among, dissident, elements, such, as, the, polish, catholics, in, silesia, a, powerful, intellectual, force, of, the, time, was, anti, catholicism, led, by, the, liberal, intellectuals, who, formed, a, vital, part, of, bismarck, s, coalition, they, saw, the, catholic, church, as, a, powerful, force, of, reaction, and, anti, modernity, especially, after, the, proclamation, of, papal, infallibility, in, 1870, and, the, tightening, control, of, the, vatican, over, the, local, bishops, the, kulturkampf, launched, by, bismarck, 1871, 1880, affected, prussia, although, there, were, similar, movements, in, baden, and, hesse, the, rest, of, germany, was, not, affected, according, to, the, new, imperial, constitution, the, states, were, in, charge, of, religious, and, educational, affairs, they, funded, the, protestant, and, catholic, schools, in, july, 1871, bismarck, abolished, the, catholic, section, of, the, prussian, ministry, of, ecclesiastical, and, educational, affairs, depriving, catholics, of, their, voice, at, the, highest, level, the, system, of, strict, government, supervision, of, schools, was, applied, only, in, catholic, areas, the, protestant, schools, were, left, alone, much, more, serious, were, the, may, laws, of, 1873, one, made, the, appointment, of, any, priest, dependent, on, his, attendance, at, a, german, university, as, opposed, to, the, seminaries, that, the, catholics, typically, used, furthermore, all, candidates, for, the, ministry, had, to, pass, an, examination, in, german, culture, before, a, state, board, which, weeded, out, intransigent, catholics, another, provision, gave, the, government, a, veto, power, over, most, church, activities, a, second, law, abolished, the, jurisdiction, of, the, vatican, over, the, catholic, church, in, prussia, its, authority, was, transferred, to, a, government, body, controlled, by, protestants, nearly, all, german, bishops, clergy, and, laymen, rejected, the, legality, of, the, new, laws, and, were, defiant, in, the, face, of, heavier, and, heavier, penalties, and, imprisonments, imposed, by, bismarck, s, government, by, 1876, all, the, prussian, bishops, were, imprisoned, or, in, exile, and, a, third, of, the, catholic, parishes, were, without, a, priest, in, the, face, of, systematic, defiance, the, bismarck, government, increased, the, penalties, and, its, attacks, and, were, challenged, in, 1875, when, a, papal, encyclical, declared, the, whole, ecclesiastical, legislation, of, prussia, was, invalid, and, threatened, to, excommunicate, any, catholic, who, obeyed, there, was, no, violence, but, the, catholics, mobilized, their, support, set, up, numerous, civic, organizations, raised, money, to, pay, fines, and, rallied, behind, their, church, and, the, centre, party, the, old, catholic, church, which, rejected, the, first, vatican, council, attracted, only, a, few, thousand, members, bismarck, a, devout, pietistic, protestant, realized, his, kulturkampf, was, backfiring, when, secular, and, socialist, elements, used, the, opportunity, to, attack, all, religion, in, the, long, run, the, most, significant, result, was, the, mobilization, of, the, catholic, voters, and, their, insistence, on, protecting, their, religious, identity, in, the, elections, of, 1874, the, centre, party, doubled, its, popular, vote, and, became, the, second, largest, party, in, the, national, parliament, and, remained, a, powerful, force, for, the, next, 60, years, so, that, after, bismarck, it, became, difficult, to, form, a, government, without, their, support, bismarck, built, on, a, tradition, of, welfare, programs, in, prussia, and, saxony, that, began, as, early, as, in, the, 1840s, in, the, 1880s, he, introduced, old, age, pensions, accident, insurance, medical, care, and, unemployment, insurance, that, formed, the, basis, of, the, modern, european, welfare, state, he, came, to, realize, that, this, sort, of, policy, was, very, appealing, since, it, bound, workers, to, the, state, and, also, fit, in, very, well, with, his, authoritarian, nature, the, social, security, systems, installed, by, bismarck, health, care, in, 1883, accident, insurance, in, 1884, invalidity, and, old, age, insurance, in, 1889, at, the, time, were, the, largest, in, the, world, and, to, a, degree, still, exist, in, germany, today, bismarck, s, paternalistic, programs, won, the, support, of, german, industry, because, its, goals, were, to, win, the, support, of, the, working, classes, for, the, empire, and, reduce, the, outflow, of, immigrants, to, america, where, wages, were, higher, but, welfare, did, not, exist, bismarck, further, won, the, support, of, both, industry, and, skilled, workers, by, his, high, tariff, policies, which, protected, profits, and, wages, from, american, competition, although, they, alienated, the, liberal, intellectuals, who, wanted, free, trade, as, it, was, throughout, europe, at, the, time, antisemitism, was, endemic, in, germany, during, the, period, before, napoleon, s, decrees, ended, the, ghettos, in, confederation, of, the, rhine, it, had, been, religiously, motivated, but, by, the, 19th, century, it, was, a, factor, in, german, nationalism, in, the, popular, mind, jews, became, a, symbol, of, capitalism, and, wealth, on, the, other, hand, the, constitution, and, legal, system, protected, the, rights, of, jews, as, german, citizens, antisemitic, parties, were, formed, but, soon, collapsed, but, after, the, treaty, of, versailles, and, adolf, hitler, s, rise, to, power, in, germany, antisemitism, in, germany, would, increase, one, of, the, effects, of, the, unification, policies, was, the, gradually, increasing, tendency, to, eliminate, the, use, of, non, german, languages, in, public, life, schools, and, academic, settings, with, the, intent, of, pressuring, the, non, german, population, to, abandon, their, national, identity, in, what, was, called, germanisation, these, policies, often, had, the, reverse, effect, of, stimulating, resistance, usually, in, the, form, of, homeschooling, and, tighter, unity, in, the, minority, groups, especially, the, poles, the, germanisation, policies, were, targeted, particularly, against, the, significant, polish, minority, of, the, empire, gained, by, prussia, in, the, partitions, of, poland, poles, were, treated, as, an, ethnic, minority, even, where, they, made, up, the, majority, as, in, the, province, of, posen, where, a, series, of, anti, polish, measures, was, enforced, numerous, anti, polish, laws, had, no, great, effect, especially, in, the, province, of, posen, where, the, german, speaking, population, dropped, from, 42, 8, in, 1871, to, 38, 1, in, 1905, despite, all, efforts, bismarck, s, efforts, also, initiated, the, levelling, of, the, enormous, differences, between, the, german, states, which, had, been, independent, in, their, evolution, for, centuries, especially, with, legislation, the, completely, different, legal, histories, and, judicial, systems, posed, enormous, complications, especially, for, national, trade, while, a, common, trade, code, had, already, been, introduced, by, the, confederation, in, 1861, which, was, adapted, for, the, empire, and, with, great, modifications, is, still, in, effect, today, there, was, little, similarity, in, laws, otherwise, in, 1871, a, common, criminal, code, was, introduced, in, 1877, common, court, procedures, were, established, in, the, court, system, by, the, courts, constitution, act, code, of, civil, procedure, zivilprozessordnung, and, code, of, criminal, procedure, strafprozessordnung, in, 1873, the, constitution, was, amended, to, allow, the, empire, to, replace, the, various, and, greatly, differing, civil, codes, of, the, states, if, they, existed, at, all, for, example, parts, of, germany, formerly, occupied, by, napoleon, s, france, had, adopted, the, french, civil, code, while, in, prussia, the, allgemeines, preu, isches, landrecht, of, 1794, was, still, in, effect, in, 1881, a, first, commission, was, established, to, produce, a, common, civil, code, for, all, of, the, empire, an, enormous, effort, that, would, produce, the, b, rgerliches, gesetzbuch, bgb, possibly, one, of, the, most, impressive, legal, works, in, the, world, it, was, eventually, put, into, effect, on, 1, january, 1900, all, of, these, codifications, are, albeit, with, many, amendments, still, in, effect, today, on, 9, march, 1888, wilhelm, i, died, shortly, before, his, 91st, birthday, leaving, his, son, frederick, as, the, new, emperor, frederick, was, a, liberal, and, an, admirer, of, the, british, constitution, while, his, links, to, britain, strengthened, further, with, his, marriage, to, princess, victoria, eldest, child, of, queen, victoria, with, his, ascent, to, the, throne, many, hoped, that, frederick, s, reign, would, lead, to, a, liberalization, of, the, reich, and, an, increase, of, parliament, s, influence, on, the, political, process, the, dismissal, of, robert, von, puttkamer, the, highly, conservative, prussian, interior, minister, on, 8, june, was, a, sign, of, the, expected, direction, and, a, blow, to, bismarck, s, administration, by, the, time, of, his, accession, however, frederick, had, developed, incurable, laryngeal, cancer, which, had, been, diagnosed, in, 1887, he, died, on, the, 99th, day, of, his, rule, on, 15, june, 1888, his, son, wilhelm, became, emperor, wilhelm, ii, wanted, to, reassert, his, ruling, prerogatives, at, a, time, when, other, monarchs, in, europe, were, being, transformed, into, constitutional, figureheads, this, decision, led, the, ambitious, kaiser, into, conflict, with, bismarck, the, old, chancellor, had, hoped, to, guide, wilhelm, as, he, had, guided, his, grandfather, but, the, emperor, wanted, to, be, the, master, in, his, own, house, and, had, many, sycophants, telling, him, that, frederick, the, great, would, not, have, been, great, with, a, bismarck, at, his, side, a, key, difference, between, wilhelm, ii, and, bismarck, was, their, approaches, to, handling, political, crises, especially, in, 1889, when, german, coal, miners, went, on, strike, in, upper, silesia, bismarck, demanded, that, the, german, army, be, sent, in, to, crush, the, strike, but, wilhelm, ii, rejected, this, authoritarian, measure, responding, i, do, not, wish, to, stain, my, reign, with, the, blood, of, my, subjects, instead, of, condoning, repression, wilhelm, had, the, government, negotiate, with, a, delegation, from, the, coal, miners, which, brought, the, strike, to, an, end, without, violence, the, fractious, relationship, ended, in, march, 1890, after, wilhelm, ii, and, bismarck, quarrelled, and, the, chancellor, resigned, days, later, with, bismarck, s, departure, wilhelm, ii, became, the, dominant, ruler, of, germany, unlike, his, grandfather, wilhelm, i, who, had, been, largely, content, to, leave, government, affairs, to, the, chancellor, wilhelm, ii, wanted, to, be, fully, informed, and, actively, involved, in, running, germany, not, an, ornamental, figurehead, although, most, germans, found, his, claims, of, divine, right, to, rule, amusing, wilhelm, allowed, politician, walther, rathenau, to, tutor, him, in, european, economics, and, industrial, and, financial, realities, in, europe, as, hull, 2004, notes, bismarckian, foreign, policy, was, too, sedate, for, the, reckless, kaiser, wilhelm, became, internationally, notorious, for, his, aggressive, stance, on, foreign, policy, and, his, strategic, blunders, such, as, the, tangier, crisis, which, pushed, the, german, empire, into, growing, political, isolation, and, eventually, helped, to, cause, world, war, i, under, wilhelm, ii, germany, no, longer, had, long, ruling, strong, chancellors, like, bismarck, the, new, chancellors, had, difficulty, in, performing, their, roles, especially, the, additional, role, as, prime, minister, of, prussia, assigned, to, them, in, the, german, constitution, the, reforms, of, chancellor, leo, von, caprivi, which, liberalized, trade, and, so, reduced, unemployment, were, supported, by, the, kaiser, and, most, germans, except, for, prussian, landowners, who, feared, loss, of, land, and, power, and, launched, several, campaigns, against, the, reforms, while, prussian, aristocrats, challenged, the, demands, of, a, united, german, state, in, the, 1890s, several, organizations, were, set, up, to, challenge, the, authoritarian, conservative, prussian, militarism, which, was, being, imposed, on, the, country, educators, opposed, to, the, german, state, run, schools, which, emphasized, military, education, set, up, their, own, independent, liberal, schools, which, encouraged, individuality, and, freedom, however, nearly, all, the, schools, in, imperial, germany, had, a, very, high, standard, and, kept, abreast, with, modern, developments, in, knowledge, artists, began, experimental, art, in, opposition, to, kaiser, wilhelm, s, support, for, traditional, art, to, which, wilhelm, responded, art, which, transgresses, the, laws, and, limits, laid, down, by, me, can, no, longer, be, called, art, it, was, largely, thanks, to, wilhelm, s, influence, that, most, printed, material, in, germany, used, blackletter, instead, of, the, roman, type, used, in, the, rest, of, western, europe, at, the, same, time, a, new, generation, of, cultural, creators, emerged, from, the, 1890s, onwards, the, most, effective, opposition, to, the, monarchy, came, from, the, newly, formed, social, democratic, party, of, germany, spd, whose, radicals, advocated, marxism, the, threat, of, the, spd, to, the, german, monarchy, and, industrialists, caused, the, state, both, to, crack, down, on, the, party, s, supporters, and, to, implement, its, own, programme, of, social, reform, to, soothe, discontent, germany, s, large, industries, provided, significant, social, welfare, programmes, and, good, care, to, their, employees, as, long, as, they, were, not, identified, as, socialists, or, trade, union, members, the, larger, industrial, firms, provided, pensions, sickness, benefits, and, even, housing, to, their, employees, having, learned, from, the, failure, of, bismarck, s, kulturkampf, wilhelm, ii, maintained, good, relations, with, the, roman, catholic, church, and, concentrated, on, opposing, socialism, this, policy, failed, when, the, social, democrats, won, a, third, of, the, votes, in, the, 1912, elections, to, the, reichstag, and, became, the, largest, political, party, in, germany, the, government, remained, in, the, hands, of, a, succession, of, conservative, coalitions, supported, by, right, wing, liberals, or, catholic, clerics, and, heavily, dependent, on, the, kaiser, s, favour, the, rising, militarism, under, wilhelm, ii, caused, many, germans, to, emigrate, to, the, u, s, and, the, british, colonies, to, escape, mandatory, military, service, during, world, war, i, the, kaiser, increasingly, devolved, his, powers, to, the, leaders, of, the, german, high, command, particularly, future, german, president, field, marshal, paul, von, hindenburg, and, generalquartiermeister, erich, ludendorff, hindenburg, took, over, the, role, of, commander, in, chief, from, the, kaiser, while, ludendorff, became, de, facto, general, chief, of, staff, by, 1916, germany, was, effectively, a, military, dictatorship, run, by, hindenburg, and, ludendorff, with, the, kaiser, reduced, to, a, mere, figurehead, wilhelm, ii, wanted, germany, to, have, her, place, in, the, sun, like, britain, which, he, constantly, wished, to, emulate, or, rival, with, german, traders, and, merchants, already, active, worldwide, he, encouraged, colonial, efforts, in, africa, and, the, pacific, new, imperialism, causing, the, german, empire, to, vie, with, other, european, powers, for, remaining, unclaimed, territories, with, the, encouragement, or, at, least, the, acquiescence, of, britain, which, at, this, stage, saw, germany, as, a, counterweight, to, her, old, rival, france, germany, acquired, german, southwest, africa, modern, namibia, german, kamerun, modern, cameroon, togoland, modern, togo, and, german, east, africa, modern, rwanda, burundi, and, the, mainland, part, of, current, tanzania, islands, were, gained, in, the, pacific, through, purchase, and, treaties, and, also, a, 99, year, lease, for, the, territory, of, jiaozhou, in, northeast, china, but, of, these, german, colonies, only, togoland, and, german, samoa, after, 1908, became, self, sufficient, and, profitable, all, the, others, required, subsidies, from, the, berlin, treasury, for, building, infrastructure, school, systems, hospitals, and, other, institutions, bismarck, had, originally, dismissed, the, agitation, for, colonies, with, contempt, he, favoured, a, eurocentric, foreign, policy, as, the, treaty, arrangements, made, during, his, tenure, in, office, show, as, a, latecomer, to, colonization, germany, repeatedly, came, into, conflict, with, the, established, colonial, powers, and, also, with, the, united, states, which, opposed, german, attempts, at, colonial, expansion, in, both, the, caribbean, and, the, pacific, native, insurrections, in, german, territories, received, prominent, coverage, in, other, countries, especially, in, britain, the, established, powers, had, dealt, with, such, uprisings, decades, earlier, often, brutally, and, had, secured, firm, control, of, their, colonies, by, then, the, boxer, rising, in, china, which, the, chinese, government, eventually, sponsored, began, in, the, shandong, province, in, part, because, germany, as, colonizer, at, jiaozhou, was, an, untested, power, and, had, only, been, active, there, for, two, years, seven, western, nations, including, the, united, states, and, japan, mounted, a, joint, relief, force, to, rescue, westerners, caught, up, in, the, rebellion, during, the, departure, ceremonies, for, the, german, contingent, wilhelm, ii, urged, them, to, behave, like, the, hun, invaders, of, continental, europe, an, unfortunate, remark, that, would, later, be, resurrected, by, british, propagandists, to, paint, germans, as, barbarians, during, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, on, two, occasions, a, french, german, conflict, over, the, fate, of, morocco, seemed, inevitable, upon, acquiring, southwest, africa, german, settlers, were, encouraged, to, cultivate, land, held, by, the, herero, and, nama, herero, and, nama, tribal, lands, were, used, for, a, variety, of, exploitative, goals, much, as, the, british, did, before, in, rhodesia, including, farming, ranching, and, mining, for, minerals, and, diamonds, in, 1904, the, herero, and, the, nama, revolted, against, the, colonists, in, southwest, africa, killing, farm, families, their, laborers, and, servants, in, response, to, the, attacks, troops, were, dispatched, to, quell, the, uprising, which, then, resulted, in, the, herero, and, namaqua, genocide, in, total, some, 65, 000, herero, 80, of, the, total, herero, population, and, 10, 000, nama, 50, of, the, total, nama, population, perished, the, commander, of, the, punitive, expedition, general, lothar, von, trotha, was, eventually, relieved, and, reprimanded, for, his, usurpation, of, orders, and, the, cruelties, he, inflicted, these, occurrences, were, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, first, genocide, of, the, 20th, century, and, officially, condemned, by, the, united, nations, in, 1985, in, 2004, a, formal, apology, by, a, government, minister, of, the, federal, republic, of, germany, followed, bismarck, and, wilhelm, ii, after, him, sought, closer, economic, ties, with, the, ottoman, empire, under, wilhelm, ii, with, the, financial, backing, of, the, deutsche, bank, the, baghdad, railway, was, begun, in, 1900, although, by, 1914, it, was, still, 500, km, 310, mi, short, of, its, destination, in, baghdad, in, an, interview, with, wilhelm, in, 1899, cecil, rhodes, had, tried, to, convince, the, kaiser, that, the, future, of, the, german, empire, abroad, lay, in, the, middle, east, and, not, in, africa, with, a, grand, middle, eastern, empire, germany, could, afford, to, allow, britain, the, unhindered, completion, of, the, cape, to, cairo, railway, that, rhodes, favoured, britain, initially, supported, the, baghdad, railway, but, by, 1911, british, statesmen, came, to, fear, it, might, be, extended, to, basra, on, the, persian, gulf, threatening, britain, s, naval, supremacy, in, the, indian, ocean, accordingly, they, asked, to, have, construction, halted, to, which, germany, and, the, ottoman, empire, acquiesced, in, south, america, germany, s, primary, interest, was, in, argentina, brazil, chile, and, uruguay, and, viewed, the, countries, of, northern, south, america, ecuador, colombia, and,

margarita, island, and, showed, interest, in, the, gal, pagos, islands, but, soon, abandoned, any, such, designs, given, that, far, flung, bases, in, northern, south, america, would, be, very, vulnerable, germany, attempted, to, promote, chile, a, country, that, was, heavily, influenced, by, germany, into, a, regional, counterweight, to, the, united, states, germany, and, britain, managed, through, chile, to, have, ecuador, deny, the, united, states, a, naval, base, in, the, gal, pagos, islands, claims, that, german, communities, in, south, america, acted, as, extensions, of, the, german, empire, were, ubiquituous, by, 1900, but, it, has, never, been, proved, that, these, communities, acted, in, such, way, to, any, significant, degree, german, political, cultural, and, scientific, influence, was, particularly, intense, in, chile, in, the, decades, before, world, war, i, and, the, prestige, of, germany, and, german, things, in, chile, remained, high, after, the, war, but, did, not, recover, to, its, pre, war, levels, berlin, was, deeply, suspicious, of, a, supposed, conspiracy, of, its, enemies, that, year, by, year, in, the, early, 20th, century, it, was, systematically, encircled, by, enemies, there, was, a, growing, fear, that, the, supposed, enemy, coalition, of, russia, france, and, britain, was, getting, stronger, militarily, every, year, especially, russia, the, longer, berlin, waited, the, less, likely, it, would, prevail, in, a, war, according, to, american, historian, gordon, a, craig, it, was, after, the, set, back, in, morocco, in, 1905, that, the, fear, of, encirclement, began, to, be, a, potent, factor, in, german, politics, few, outside, observers, agreed, with, the, notion, of, germany, as, a, victim, of, deliberate, encirclement, english, historian, g, m, trevelyan, expressed, the, british, viewpoint, the, encirclement, such, as, it, was, was, of, germany, s, own, making, she, had, encircled, herself, by, alienating, france, over, alsace, lorraine, russia, by, her, support, of, austria, hungary, s, anti, slav, policy, in, the, balkans, england, by, building, her, rival, fleet, she, had, created, with, austria, hungary, a, military, bloc, in, the, heart, of, europe, so, powerful, and, yet, so, restless, that, her, neighbors, on, each, side, had, no, choice, but, either, to, become, her, vassals, or, to, stand, together, for, protection, they, used, their, central, position, to, create, fear, in, all, sides, in, order, to, gain, their, diplomatic, ends, and, then, they, complained, that, on, all, sides, they, had, been, encircled, wilhelm, ii, under, pressure, from, his, new, advisors, after, bismarck, left, committed, a, fatal, error, when, he, decided, to, allow, the, reinsurance, treaty, that, bismarck, had, negotiated, with, tsarist, russia, to, lapse, it, allowed, russia, to, make, a, new, alliance, with, france, germany, was, left, with, no, firm, ally, but, austria, hungary, and, her, support, for, action, in, annexing, bosnia, and, herzegovina, in, 1908, further, soured, relations, with, russia, berlin, missed, the, opportunity, to, secure, an, alliance, with, britain, in, the, 1890s, when, it, was, involved, in, colonial, rivalries, with, france, and, he, alienated, british, statesmen, further, by, openly, supporting, the, boers, in, the, south, african, war, and, building, a, navy, to, rival, britain, s, by, 1911, wilhelm, had, completely, picked, apart, the, careful, power, balance, established, by, bismarck, and, britain, turned, to, france, in, the, entente, cordiale, germany, s, only, other, ally, besides, austria, was, the, kingdom, of, italy, but, it, remained, an, ally, only, pro, forma, when, war, came, italy, saw, more, benefit, in, an, alliance, with, britain, france, and, russia, which, in, the, secret, treaty, of, london, in, 1915, promised, it, the, frontier, districts, of, austria, and, also, colonial, concessions, germany, did, acquire, a, second, ally, in, 1914, when, the, ottoman, empire, entered, the, war, on, its, side, but, in, the, long, run, supporting, the, ottoman, war, effort, only, drained, away, german, resources, from, the, main, fronts, following, the, assassination, of, the, austro, hungarian, archduke, franz, ferdinand, by, gavrilo, princip, the, kaiser, offered, emperor, franz, joseph, full, support, for, austro, hungarian, plans, to, invade, the, kingdom, of, serbia, which, austria, hungary, blamed, for, the, assassination, this, unconditional, support, for, austria, hungary, was, called, a, blank, cheque, by, historians, including, german, fritz, fischer, subsequent, interpretation, for, example, at, the, versailles, peace, conference, was, that, this, blank, cheque, licensed, austro, hungarian, aggression, regardless, of, the, diplomatic, consequences, and, thus, germany, bore, responsibility, for, starting, the, war, or, at, least, provoking, a, wider, conflict, germany, began, the, war, by, targeting, its, chief, rival, france, germany, saw, the, french, republic, as, its, principal, danger, on, the, european, continent, as, it, could, mobilize, much, faster, than, russia, and, bordered, germany, s, industrial, core, in, the, rhineland, unlike, britain, and, russia, the, french, entered, the, war, mainly, for, revenge, against, germany, in, particular, for, france, s, loss, of, alsace, lorraine, to, germany, in, 1871, the, german, high, command, knew, that, france, would, muster, its, forces, to, go, into, alsace, lorraine, aside, from, the, very, unofficial, septemberprogramm, the, germans, never, stated, a, clear, list, of, goals, that, they, wanted, out, of, the, war, germany, did, not, want, to, risk, lengthy, battles, along, the, franco, german, border, and, instead, adopted, the, schlieffen, plan, a, military, strategy, designed, to, cripple, france, by, invading, belgium, and, luxembourg, sweeping, down, to, encircle, and, crush, both, paris, and, the, french, forces, along, the, franco, german, border, in, a, quick, victory, after, defeating, france, germany, would, turn, to, attack, russia, the, plan, required, violating, the, official, neutrality, of, belgium, and, luxembourg, which, britain, had, guaranteed, by, treaty, however, the, germans, had, calculated, that, britain, would, enter, the, war, regardless, of, whether, they, had, formal, justification, to, do, so, at, first, the, attack, was, successful, the, german, army, swept, down, from, belgium, and, luxembourg, and, advanced, on, paris, at, the, nearby, river, marne, however, the, evolution, of, weapons, over, the, last, century, heavily, favored, defense, over, offense, especially, thanks, to, the, machine, gun, so, that, it, took, proportionally, more, offensive, force, to, overcome, a, defensive, position, this, resulted, in, the, german, lines, on, the, offense, contracting, to, keep, up, the, offensive, timetable, while, correspondingly, the, french, lines, were, extending, in, addition, some, german, units, that, were, originally, slotted, for, the, german, far, right, were, transferred, to, the, eastern, front, in, reaction, to, russia, mobilizing, far, faster, than, anticipated, the, combined, effect, had, the, german, right, flank, sweeping, down, in, front, of, paris, instead, of, behind, it, exposing, the, german, right, flank, to, the, extending, french, lines, and, attack, from, strategic, french, reserves, stationed, in, paris, attacking, the, exposed, german, right, flank, the, french, army, and, the, british, army, put, up, a, strong, resistance, to, the, defense, of, paris, at, the, first, battle, of, the, marne, resulting, in, the, german, army, retreating, to, defensive, positions, along, the, river, aisne, a, subsequent, race, to, the, sea, resulted, in, a, long, held, stalemate, between, the, german, army, and, the, allies, in, dug, in, trench, warfare, positions, from, alsace, to, flanders, german, attempts, to, break, through, failed, at, the, two, battles, of, ypres, 1st, 2nd, with, huge, casualties, a, series, of, allied, offensives, in, 1915, against, german, positions, in, artois, and, champagne, resulted, in, huge, allied, casualties, and, little, territorial, change, german, chief, of, staff, erich, von, falkenhayn, decided, to, exploit, the, defensive, advantages, that, had, shown, themselves, in, the, 1915, allied, offensives, by, attempting, to, goad, france, into, attacking, strong, defensive, positions, near, the, ancient, city, of, verdun, verdun, had, been, one, of, the, last, cities, to, hold, out, against, the, german, army, in, 1870, and, falkenhayn, predicted, that, as, a, matter, of, national, pride, the, french, would, do, anything, to, ensure, that, it, was, not, taken, he, expected, that, he, could, take, strong, defensive, positions, in, the, hills, overlooking, verdun, on, the, east, bank, of, the, river, meuse, to, threaten, the, city, and, the, french, would, launch, desperate, attacks, against, these, positions, he, predicted, that, french, losses, would, be, greater, than, those, of, the, germans, and, that, continued, french, commitment, of, troops, to, verdun, would, bleed, the, french, army, white, in, february, 1916, the, battle, of, verdun, began, with, the, french, positions, under, constant, shelling, and, poison, gas, attack, and, taking, large, casualties, under, the, assault, of, overwhelmingly, large, german, forces, however, falkenhayn, s, prediction, of, a, greater, ratio, of, french, killed, proved, to, be, wrong, as, both, sides, took, heavy, casualties, falkenhayn, was, replaced, by, erich, ludendorff, and, with, no, success, in, sight, the, german, army, pulled, out, of, verdun, in, december, 1916, and, the, battle, ended, while, the, western, front, was, a, stalemate, for, the, german, army, the, eastern, front, eventually, proved, to, be, a, great, success, despite, initial, setbacks, due, to, the, unexpectedly, rapid, mobilisation, of, the, russian, army, which, resulted, in, a, russian, invasion, of, east, prussia, and, austrian, galicia, the, badly, organised, and, supplied, russian, army, faltered, and, the, german, and, austro, hungarian, armies, thereafter, steadily, advanced, eastward, the, germans, benefited, from, political, instability, in, russia, and, its, population, s, desire, to, end, the, war, in, 1917, the, german, government, allowed, russia, s, communist, bolshevik, leader, vladimir, lenin, to, travel, through, germany, from, switzerland, into, russia, germany, believed, that, if, lenin, could, create, further, political, unrest, russia, would, no, longer, be, able, to, continue, its, war, with, germany, allowing, the, german, army, to, focus, on, the, western, front, in, march, 1917, the, tsar, was, ousted, from, the, russian, throne, and, in, november, a, bolshevik, government, came, to, power, under, the, leadership, of, lenin, facing, political, opposition, he, decided, to, end, russia, s, campaign, against, germany, austria, hungary, the, ottoman, empire, and, bulgaria, to, redirect, bolshevik, energy, to, eliminating, internal, dissent, in, march, 1918, by, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, the, bolshevik, government, gave, germany, and, the, ottoman, empire, enormous, territorial, and, economic, concessions, in, exchange, for, an, end, to, war, on, the, eastern, front, all, of, present, day, estonia, latvia, and, lithuania, was, given, over, to, the, german, occupation, authority, ober, ost, along, with, belarus, and, ukraine, thus, germany, had, at, last, achieved, its, long, wanted, dominance, of, mitteleuropa, central, europe, and, could, now, focus, fully, on, defeating, the, allies, on, the, western, front, in, practice, however, the, forces, that, were, needed, to, garrison, and, secure, the, new, territories, were, a, drain, on, the, german, war, effort, germany, quickly, lost, almost, all, its, colonies, however, in, german, east, africa, a, guerrilla, campaign, was, waged, by, the, colonial, army, leader, there, general, paul, emil, von, lettow, vorbeck, using, germans, and, native, askaris, lettow, vorbeck, launched, multiple, guerrilla, raids, against, british, forces, in, kenya, and, rhodesia, he, also, invaded, portuguese, mozambique, to, gain, his, forces, supplies, and, to, pick, up, more, askari, recruits, his, force, was, still, active, at, war, s, end, the, defeat, of, russia, in, 1917, enabled, germany, to, transfer, hundreds, of, thousands, of, troops, from, the, eastern, to, the, western, front, giving, it, a, numerical, advantage, over, the, allies, by, retraining, the, soldiers, in, new, infiltration, tactics, the, germans, expected, to, unfreeze, the, battlefield, and, win, a, decisive, victory, before, the, army, of, the, united, states, which, had, now, entered, the, war, on, the, side, of, the, allies, arrived, in, strength, in, what, was, known, as, the, kaiserschlacht, germany, converged, their, troops, and, delivered, multiple, blows, that, pushed, back, the, allies, however, the, repeated, german, offensives, in, the, spring, of, 1918, all, failed, as, the, allies, fell, back, and, regrouped, and, the, germans, lacked, the, reserves, needed, to, consolidate, their, gains, meanwhile, soldiers, had, become, radicalised, by, the, russian, revolution, and, were, less, willing, to, continue, fighting, the, war, effort, sparked, civil, unrest, in, germany, while, the, troops, who, had, been, constantly, in, the, field, without, relief, grew, exhausted, and, lost, all, hope, of, victory, in, the, summer, of, 1918, the, british, army, was, at, its, peak, strength, with, as, many, as, 4, 5, million, men, on, the, western, front, and, 4, 000, tanks, for, the, hundred, days, offensive, the, americans, arriving, at, the, rate, of, 10, 000, a, day, germany, s, allies, facing, collapse, and, the, german, empire, s, manpower, exhausted, it, was, only, a, matter, of, time, before, multiple, allied, offensives, destroyed, the, german, army, the, concept, of, total, war, meant, that, supplies, had, to, be, redirected, towards, the, armed, forces, and, with, german, commerce, being, stopped, by, the, allied, naval, blockade, german, civilians, were, forced, to, live, in, increasingly, meagre, conditions, first, food, prices, were, controlled, then, rationing, was, introduced, during, the, war, about, 750, 000, german, civilians, died, from, malnutrition, towards, the, end, of, the, war, conditions, deteriorated, rapidly, on, the, home, front, with, severe, food, shortages, reported, in, all, urban, areas, the, causes, included, the, transfer, of, many, farmers, and, food, workers, into, the, military, combined, with, the, overburdened, railway, system, shortages, of, coal, and, the, british, blockade, the, winter, of, 1916, 1917, was, known, as, the, turnip, winter, because, the, people, had, to, survive, on, a, vegetable, more, commonly, reserved, for, livestock, as, a, substitute, for, potatoes, and, meat, which, were, increasingly, scarce, thousands, of, soup, kitchens, were, opened, to, feed, the, hungry, who, grumbled, that, the, farmers, were, keeping, the, food, for, themselves, even, the, army, had, to, cut, the, soldiers, rations, the, morale, of,

alone, many, germans, wanted, an, end, to, the, war, and, increasing, numbers, began, to, associate, with, the, political, left, such, as, the, social, democratic, party, spd, and, the, more, radical, independent, social, democratic, party, uspd, which, demanded, an, end, to, the, war, the, entry, of, the, u, s, into, the, war, in, april, 1917, tipped, the, long, run, balance, of, power, even, more, in, favour, of, the, allies, the, end, of, october, 1918, in, kiel, in, northern, germany, saw, the, beginning, of, the, german, revolution, of, 1918, 1919, units, of, the, german, navy,
