being, pressured, by, innocent, at, the, same, period, the, army, of, lothair, revolted, lothair, who, had, hoped, for, the, complete, conquest, of, sicily, then, gave, capua, and, apulia, from, the,

of, roger, with, the, treaty, of, mignano, roger, spent, most, of, the, decade, beginning, with, his, coronation, and, ending, with, the, assizes, of, ariano, enacting, a, series, of, laws, with, which, roger, intended, to, centralise, the, government, he, also, fended, off, several, invasions, and, quelled, rebellions, by, his, premier, vassals, grimoald, of, bari, robert, ii, of, capua, ranulf, of, alife, sergius, vii, of, naples, and, others, it, was, through, his, admiral, george, of, antioch, that, roger, then, conquered, the, littoral, of, ifriqiya, from, the, zirids, taking, the, unofficial, title, king, of, africa, and, marking, the, foundation, of, the, norman, kingdom, of, africa, at, the, same, time, roger, s, fleet, also, attacked, the, byzantine, empire, making, sicily, a, leading, maritime, power, in, the, mediterranean, sea, for, almost, a, century, roger, s, son, and, successor, was, william, i, of, sicily, known, as, william, the, bad, though, his, nickname, derived, primarily, from, his, lack, of, popularity, with, the, chroniclers, who, supported, the, baronial, revolts, which, william, suppressed, in, the, mid, 1150s, william, lost, the, majority, of, his, african, possessions, to, a, series, of, revolts, by, local, north, african, lords, then, in, 1160, the, final, norman, african, stronghold, of, mahdia, was, taken, by, the, almohads, his, reign, ended, in, peace, in, 1166, his, elder, son, roger, iv, duke, of, apulia, had, been, killed, in, previous, revolts, and, his, son, william, ii, was, a, minor, until, the, end, of, the, boy, s, regency, by, his, mother, margaret, of, navarre, in, 1172, turmoil, in, the, kingdom, almost, brought, the, ruling, family, down, the, reign, of, william, ii, is, remembered, as, two, decades, of, almost, continual, peace, and, prosperity, for, this, more, than, anything, he, is, nicknamed, the, good, however, he, had, no, issue, which, led, to, a, succession, crisis, his, aunt, constance, the, sole, heir, to, the, throne, as, the, daughter, of, roger, ii, was, long, confined, in, a, monastery, as, a, nun, with, her, marriage, beyond, consideration, due, to, a, prediction, that, her, marriage, would, destroy, sicily, nevertheless, in, 1184, she, was, betrothed, to, henry, the, eldest, son, of, frederick, i, holy, roman, emperor, and, the, future, emperor, henry, vi, william, named, constance, and, henry, the, heirs, to, the, throne, and, had, the, noblemen, swear, oath, but, the, officials, did, not, want, to, be, ruled, by, a, german, so, the, death, of, william, in, 1189, led, the, kingdom, to, decline, with, the, support, of, the, officials, tancred, of, lecce, seized, the, throne, in, the, same, year, he, had, to, contend, with, the, revolt, of, his, distant, cousin, roger, of, andria, a, former, contender, who, supported, henry, and, constance, but, was, tricked, to, execution, in, 1190, as, well, as, the, invasion, of, henry, king, of, germany, and, holy, roman, emperor, since, 1191, who, invaded, on, behalf, of, his, wife, henry, had, to, retreat, after, his, attack, failed, with, empress, constance, captured, and, only, released, under, the, pressure, of, the, pope, tancred, died, in, 1194, and, constance, and, henry, prevailed, the, kingdom, was, conquered, in, 1194, with, the, house, of, hohenstaufen, william, iii, of, sicily, the, young, son, of, tancred, was, deposed, and, henry, and, constance, were, crowned, as, king, and, queen, through, constance, the, hauteville, blood, was, passed, to, frederick, who, reigned, in, sicily, as, frederick, i, in, 1197, the, accession, of, frederick, a, child, who, would, also, become, holy, roman, emperor, frederick, ii, in, 1220, greatly, affected, the, immediate, future, of, sicily, for, a, land, so, used, to, centralised, royal, authority, the, king, s, young, age, caused, a, serious, power, vacuum, his, uncle, philip, of, swabia, moved, to, secure, frederick, s, inheritance, by, appointing, markward, von, anweiler, margrave, of, ancona, regent, in, 1198, meanwhile, pope, innocent, iii, had, reasserted, papal, authority, in, sicily, but, recognised, frederick, s, rights, the, pope, was, to, see, papal, power, decrease, steadily, over, the, next, decade, and, was, unsure, about, which, side, to, back, at, many, junctures, the, hohenstaufen, s, grip, on, power, however, was, not, secure, walter, iii, of, brienne, had, married, the, daughter, of, tancred, of, sicily, she, was, sister, and, heiress, of, the, deposed, king, william, iii, of, sicily, in, 1201, william, decided, to, claim, the, kingdom, in, 1202, an, army, led, by, the, chancellor, walter, of, palearia, and, dipold, of, vohburg, was, defeated, by, walter, iii, of, brienne, markward, was, killed, and, frederick, fell, under, the, control, of, william, of, capparone, an, ally, of, the, pisans, dipold, continued, the, war, against, walter, on, the, mainland, until, the, claimant, s, death, in, 1205, dipold, finally, wrested, frederick, from, capparone, in, 1206, and, gave, him, over, to, the, guardianship, of, the, chancellor, walter, of, palearia, walter, and, dipold, then, had, a, falling, out, and, the, latter, captured, the, royal, palace, where, he, was, besieged, and, captured, by, walter, in, 1207, after, a, decade, the, wars, over, the, regency, and, the, throne, itself, had, ceased, the, reform, of, the, laws, began, with, the, assizes, of, ariano, in, 1140, by, roger, ii, of, sicily, frederick, i, continued, the, reformation, with, the, assizes, of, capua, 1220, and, the, promulgation, of, the, constitutions, of, melfi, 1231, also, known, as, liber, augustalis, a, collection, of, laws, for, his, realm, that, was, remarkable, for, its, time, the, constitutions, of, melfi, were, created, in, order, to, establish, a, centralized, state, for, example, citizens, were, not, allowed, to, carry, weapons, or, wear, armour, in, public, unless, they, were, under, royal, command, as, a, result, rebellions, were, reduced, the, constitutions, made, the, kingdom, of, sicily, an, absolute, monarchy, the, first, centralized, state, in, europe, to, emerge, from, feudalism, it, also, set, a, precedent, for, the, primacy, of, written, law, with, relatively, small, modifications, the, liber, augustalis, remained, the, basis, of, sicilian, law, until, 1819, during, this, period, he, also, built, the, castel, del, monte, and, in, 1224, he, founded, the, university, of, naples, now, called, university, of, naples, federico, ii, frederick, had, to, beat, off, a, papal, invasion, of, sicily, in, the, war, of, the, keys, 1228, 1230, after, his, death, the, kingdom, was, ruled, by, conrad, iv, of, germany, the, next, legitimate, heir, was, conradin, who, was, too, young, at, the, period, to, rule, manfred, of, sicily, the, illegitimate, son, of, frederick, took, power, and, ruled, the, kingdom, for, fifteen, years, while, other, hohenstaufen, heirs, were, ruling, various, areas, in, germany, after, long, wars, against, the, papal, states, the, kingdom, managed, to, defend, its, possessions, but, the, papacy, declared, the, kingdom, escheated, because, of, the, disloyalty, of, the, hohenstaufen, under, this, pretext, manfred, came, to, an, agreement, with, louis, ix, king, of, france, louis, s, brother, charles, of, anjou, would, become, king, of, sicily, in, exchange, charles, recognized, the, overlordship, of, the, pope, in, the, kingdom, paid, a, portion, of, the, papal, debt, and, agreed, to, pay, annual, tribute, to, the, papal, states, the, chinea, the, miossi, family, a, noble, family, was, commissioned, in, 1251, by, pope, innocent, iv, to, administer, the, kingdom, of, sicily, the, hohenstaufen, rule, in, sicily, ended, after, the, 1266, angevin, invasion, and, the, death, of, conradin, the, last, male, heir, of, hohenstaufen, in, 1268, in, 1266, conflict, between, the, hohenstaufen, house, and, the, papacy, led, to, sicily, s, conquest, by, charles, i, duke, of, anjou, with, the, usurpation, of, the, sicilian, throne, from, conradin, by, manfred, of, sicily, in, 1258, the, relationship, between, the, papacy, and, the, hohenstaufen, had, changed, again, instead, of, the, boy, conradin, safely, sequestered, across, the, alps, the, papacy, now, faced, an, able, military, leader, who, had, greatly, supported, the, ghibelline, cause, at, the, battle, of, montaperti, in, 1260, accordingly, when, negotiations, broke, down, with, manfred, in, 1262, pope, urban, iv, again, took, up, the, scheme, of, disseising, the, hohenstaufen, from, the, kingdom, and, offered, the, crown, to, charles, of, anjou, again, with, papal, and, guelph, support, charles, descended, into, italy, and, defeated, manfred, at, the, battle, of, benevento, in, 1266, and, in, 1268, conradin, at, the, battle, of, tagliacozzo, opposition, to, french, officialdom, and, taxation, combined, with, incitement, of, rebellion, by, agents, from, the, crown, of, aragon, and, the, byzantine, empire, led, to, the, successful, insurrection, of, the, sicilian, vespers, followed, by, the, invitation, and, intervention, by, king, peter, iii, of, aragon, in, 1282, the, resulting, war, of, the, sicilian, vespers, lasted, until, the, peace, of, caltabellotta, in, 1302, dividing, the, old, kingdom, of, sicily, in, two, the, island, of, sicily, called, the, kingdom, of, sicily, beyond, the, lighthouse, or, the, kingdom, of, trinacria, went, to, frederick, iii, of, the, house, of, barcelona, who, had, been, ruling, it, the, peninsular, territories, the, mezzogiorno, contemporaneously, called, the, kingdom, of, sicily, but, called, the, kingdom, of, naples, by, modern, scholarship, went, to, charles, ii, of, the, house, of, anjou, who, had, likewise, been, ruling, it, thus, the, peace, was, formal, recognition, of, an, uneasy, status, quo, the, division, in, the, kingdom, became, permanent, in, 1372, with, the, treaty, of, villeneuve, though, the, king, of, aragon, was, able, to, seize, both, crowns, in, the, 16th, century, the, administrations, of, the, two, halves, of, the, kingdom, of, sicily, remained, separated, until, 1816, when, they, were, reunited, in, the, kingdom, of, two, sicilies, sicily, was, ruled, as, an, independent, kingdom, by, relatives, or, cadet, branch, of, the, house, of, aragon, until, 1409, and, thence, as, part, of, the, crown, of, aragon, the, kingdom, of, naples, was, ruled, by, the, angevin, ruler, ren, of, anjou, until, the, two, thrones, were, reunited, by, alfonso, v, of, aragon, after, the, successful, siege, of, naples, and, the, defeat, of, ren, on, 6, june, 1443, alfonso, of, aragon, divided, the, two, kingdoms, during, his, rule, he, gave, the, rule, of, naples, to, his, illegitimate, son, ferdinand, i, of, naples, who, ruled, from, 1458, to, 1494, and, the, rest, of, the, crown, of, aragon, and, sicily, to, his, brother, john, ii, of, aragon, from, 1494, to, 1503, successive, kings, of, france, charles, viii, and, louis, xii, who, were, heirs, of, the, angevins, tried, to, conquer, naples,

kingdom, of, spain, until, the, end, of, the, spanish, branch, of, the, house, of, habsburg, in, 1700, in, 1530, in, an, effort, to, protect, rome, from, ottoman, invasion, from, the, south, charles, v, holy, roman, emperor, as, king, of, spain, and, sicily, gave, the, islands, of, malta, and, gozo, to, the, knights, hospitaller, in, perpetual, fiefdom, in, exchange, for, an, annual, fee, of, two, maltese, falcons, which, they, were, to, send, on, all, souls, day, to, the, viceroy, of, sicily, the, maltese, islands, had, formed, part, of, the, county, and, later, the, kingdom, of, sicily, since, 1091, the, feudal, relationship, between, malta, and, the, kingdom, of, sicily, was, continued, throughout, the, rule, of, the, knights, until, the, french, occupation, of, malta, in, 1798, after, the, maltese, rebellion, against, the, french, malta, was, under, british, protection, until, it, became, a, british, crown, colony, in, 1813, this, was, officially, recognized, by, the, treaty, of, paris, of, 1814, which, marked, the, end, of, malta, s, 700, year, relationship, with, sicily, from, 1713, until, 1720, the, kingdom, of, sicily, was, ruled, briefly, by, the, house, of, savoy, which, had, received, it, by, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, utrecht, which, brought, an, end, to, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, the, kingdom, was, a, reward, to, the, savoyards, who, were, thus, elevated, to, royal, rank, the, new, king, victor, amadeus, ii, travelled, to, sicily, in, 1713, and, remained, a, year, before, returning, to, his, mainland, capital, turin, where, his, son, the, prince, of, piedmont, had, been, acting, as, regent, in, spain, the, results, of, the, war, had, not, been, truly, accepted, and, the, war, of, the, quadruple, alliance, was, the, result, sicily, was, occupied, by, spain, in, 1718, when, it, became, evident, that, savoy, had, not, the, strength, to, defend, as, remote, a, country, as, sicily, austria, stepped, in, and, exchanged, its, kingdom, of, sardinia, for, sicily, victor, amadeus, protested, this, exchange, sicily, being, a, rich, country, of, over, one, million, inhabitants, and, sardinia, a, poor, country, of, a, few, hundred, thousand, but, he, was, unable, to, resist, his, allies, spain, was, finally, defeated, in, 1720, and, the, treaty, of, the, hague, ratified, the, changeover, sicily, belonged, to, the, austrian, habsburgs, who, already, ruled, naples, victor, amadeus, for, his, part, continued, to, protest, for, three, years, and, only, in, 1723, decided, to, recognize, the, exchange, and, desist, from, using, the, sicilian, royal, title, and, its, subsidiary, titles, such, as, king, of, cyprus, and, jerusalem, in, 1734, in, the, aftermath, of, the, war, of, the, polish, succession, naples, was, reconquered, by, king, philip, v, of, spain, a, bourbon, who, installed, his, younger, son, duke, charles, of, parma, as, king, charles, vii, of, naples, starting, a, cadet, branch, of, the, house, of, bourbon, adding, to, his, neapolitan, possessions, he, became, also, king, of, sicily, with, the, name, of, charles, v, of, sicily, the, next, year, after, austria, gave, up, sicily, and, her, pretensions, to, naples, in, exchange, for, the, duchy, of, parma, and, the, grand, duchy, of, tuscany, this, change, of, hands, opened, up, a, period, of, economic, flourishing, and, social, and, political, reforms, with, many, public, projects, and, cultural, initiatives, directly, started, or, inspired, by, the, king, he, remained, king, of, sicily, until, his, accession, to, the, spanish, throne, as, charles, iii, of, spain, in, 1759, the, treaty, of, vienna, 1738, with, austria, forbidding, a, union, of, the, italian, domains, with, the, crown, of, spain, charles, iii, abdicated, in, favour, of, ferdinand, his, third, son, who, acceded, to, the, thrones, with, the, names, of, ferdinand, iv, of, naples, and, iii, of, sicily, still, a, minor, ferdinand, grew, up, amongst, pleasures, and, leisure, while, the, real, power, was, safely, held, by, bernardo, tanucci, the, president, of, the, regency, council, during, this, period, most, of, the, reform, process, initiated, by, charles, came, to, a, halt, with, the, king, mostly, absent, or, uninterested, in, the, matters, of, state, and, the, political, helm, steered, by, queen, maria, carolina, and, prime, ministers, tanucci, until, 1777, and, john, acton, the, latter, tried, to, distance, naples, and, sicily, from, the, influence, of, spain, and, austria, and, to, place, them, nearer, to, great, britain, then, represented, by, ambassador, william, hamilton, this, is, the, period, of, the, grand, tour, and, sicily, with, its, many, natural, and, historical, attractions, was, visited, by, a, score, of, intellectuals, from, all, over, europe, that, brought, to, the, island, the, winds, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, and, spread, the, fame, of, its, beauty, in, the, continent, in, 1799, napoleon, conquered, naples, forcing, king, ferdinand, and, the, court, to, flee, to, sicily, under, the, protection, of, the, british, fleet, under, the, command, of, horatio, nelson, while, naples, was, formed, into, the, parthenopean, republic, with, french, support, and, later, again, a, kingdom, under, french, protection, and, influence, sicily, became, the, british, base, of, operation, in, the, mediterranean, in, the, long, struggle, against, napoleon, under, british, guidance, especially, from, lord, william, bentinck, who, was, commander, of, british, troops, in, sicily, sicily, tried, to, modernise, its, constitutional, apparatus, forcing, the, king, to, ratify, a, constitution, modeled, after, the, british, system, the, island, was, under, british, occupation, from, 1806, to, 1814, the, main, feature, of, the, new, system, was, that, a, two, chamber, parliament, was, formed, instead, of, the, three, of, the, existing, one, the, formation, of, the, parliament, brought, the, end, of, feudalism, in, the, kingdom, after, the, defeat, of, napoleon, in, 1815, ferdinand, repealed, all, reforms, and, even, erased, the, kingdom, of, sicily, from, the, map, after, a, history, of, 800, years, by, creating, the, brand, new, kingdom, of, the, two, sicilies, with, naples, as, its, capital, in, 1816, the, people, of, sicily, rebelled, to, this, violation, of, its, centuries, old, statutes, which, every, king, including, ferdinand, had, sworn, to, respect, but, were, defeated, by, the, neapolitan, and, austrian, forces, in, 1820, in, 1848, 49, another, sicilian, revolution, of, independence, occurred, which, was, put, down, by, the, new, king, ferdinand, ii, of, the, two, sicilies, who, was, nicknamed, re, bomba, after, his, 5, day, bombardment, of, messina, the, increased, hostility, of, the, peoples, and, the, elites, of, sicily, towards, naples, and, the, bourbon, dynasty, created, a, very, unstable, equilibrium, kept, under, control, only, by, an, increasingly, oppressive, police, state, political, executions, and, exiles, during, the, norman, kingdom, of, sicily, the, local, communities, maintained, their, privileges, the, rulers, of, the, hohenstaufen, kingdom, replaced, the, local, nobility, with, lords, from, northern, italy, leading, to, clashes, and, rebellions, against, the, new, nobility, in, many, cities, and, rural, communities, these, revolts, resulted, in, the, destruction, of, many, agrarian, areas, and, the, rise, of, middle, class, nationalism, which, eventually, led, to, urban, dwellers, becoming, allies, of, the, aragonese, this, situation, was, continued, during, the, short, rule, of, the, angevins, until, their, overthrowing, during, the, sicilian, vespers, the, angevins, began, feudalising, the, country, increasing, the, power, of, the, nobility, by, granting, them, jurisdiction, over, high, justice, at, the, same, period, the, feudalisation, of, the, kingdom, of, sicily, was, intensified, through, the, enforcement, of, feudal, bonds, and, relations, among, its, subjects, the, 1669, etna, eruption, destroyed, catania, in, 1693, 5, of, the, kingdom, s, population, was, killed, because, of, earthquakes, during, that, period, there, were, also, plague, outbreaks, the, 17th, and, 18th, century, were, an, era, of, decline, of, the, kingdom, corruption, was, prevalent, among, the, upper, and, middle, classes, of, the, society, widespread, corruption, and, mistreatment, of, the, lower, classes, by, the, feudal, lords, led, to, the, creation, of, groups, of, brigands, attacking, the, nobility, and, destroying, their, fiefs, these, groups, which, were, self, named, mafia, were, the, foundation, of, the, modern, sicilian, mafia, the, escalation, of, revolts, against, the, monarchy, eventually, led, to, the, unification, with, italy, the, kingdom, had, a, parliament, from, 1097, which, continued, to, sit, throughout, the, realm, s, history, until, the, sicilian, constitution, of, 1812, during, the, reign, of, frederick, ii, 1198, 1250, the, kingdom, had, a, population, of, about, 2, 5, million, during, the, hohenstaufen, era, the, kingdom, had, 3, towns, with, a, population, of, over, 20, 000, each, after, the, loss, of, the, northern, provinces, in, 1282, during, the, sicilian, vespers, and, several, natural, disasters, like, the, 1669, etna, eruption, the, population, of, the, kingdom, of, sicily, was, reduced, in, 1803, the, population, of, the, kingdom, was, 1, 656, 000, the, main, cities, of, the, kingdom, at, that, time, were, palermo, catania, messina, modica, syracuse, the, high, fertility, of, the, land, led, the, norman, kings, to, bring, settlers, from, neighbouring, regions, or, to, resettle, farmers, to, areas, where, cultivation, of, land, was, needed, this, led, to, an, increase, in, agricultural, production, the, main, sources, of, wealth, for, the, kingdom, of, sicily, in, that, time, were, its, maritime, cities, most, important, of, which, were, the, ancient, port, cities, of, naples, and, its, nearby, counterpart, amalfi, from, which, local, products, were, exported, the, main, export, was, durum, wheat, with, other, exports, including, nuts, timber, oil, bacon, cheese, furs, hides, hemp, and, cloth, grain, and, other, dry, products, were, measured, in, salme, which, was, equivalent, to, 275, 08, litres, in, the, western, part, of, the, kingdom, and, 300, 3, litres, in, the, eastern, part, the, salma, was, divided, in, 16, tumoli, one, tumolo, was, equivalent, to, 17, 193, litres, weight, was, measured, in, cantari, one, cantaro, was, equivalent, to, 79, 35, kilograms, 174, 9, lb, and, was, divided, in, one, hundred, rottoli, cloth, was, measured, in, canne, one, canna, was, 2, 06, meters, long, by, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, messina, had, become, one, of, the, leading, commercial, cities, of, the, kingdom, under, the, kingdom, sicily, s, products, went, to, many, different, lands, among, these, were, genoa, pisa, the, byzantine, empire, and, egypt, over, the, course, of, the, 12th, century, sicily, became, an, important, source, of, raw, materials, for, north, italian, cities, such, as, genoa, as, the, centuries, went, on, however, this, economic, relationship, became, less, advantageous, to, sicily, and, some, modern, scholars, see, the, relationship, as, definitely, exploitative, furthermore, many, scholars, believe, that, sicily, went, into, decline, in, the, late, middle, ages, though, they, do, not, agree, about, when, this, decline, occurred, clifford, backman, argues, that, it, is, a, mistake, to, see, the, economic, history, of, sicily, in, terms, of, victimization, and, contends, that, the, decline, really, began, in, the, second, part, of, the, reign, of, frederick, iii, in, contrast, to, earlier, scholars, who, believed, that, sicilian, decline, had, set, in, earlier, where, earlier, scholars, saw, late, medieval, sicily, in, continuous, decline, stephen, epstein, argued, that, sicilian, society, experienced, something, of, a, revival, in, the, 15th, century, various, treaties, with, genoa, secured, and, strengthened, the, commercial, power, of, sicily, the, feudalisation, of, society, during, the, angevin, rule, reduced, royal, wealth, and, treasury, the, dependence, of, the, angevins, on, north, italian, commerce, and, financing, by, florentine, bankers, were, the, main, factors, which, led, to, the, decline, of, the, kingdom, s, economy, the, continuation, of, the, economic, decline, combined, with, the, increased, population, and, urbanization, led, to, decrease, of, agrarian, production, in, 1800, one, third, of, the, available, crops, was, cultivated, with, obsolete, methods, exacerbating, the, problem, in, the, later, period, of, spanish, rule, the, trading, system, was, also, inefficient, compared, with, previous, periods, because, of, high, taxes, on, exports, and, monopolising, corporations, which, had, total, control, of, prices, the, norman, kings, in, the, 12th, century, used, the, tari, which, had, been, used, in, sicily, from, 913, as, the, basic, coin, one, tari, weighed, about, one, gram, and, was,

italians, brought, from, northern, italy, who, wanted, muslim, property, for, their, own, led, many, muslim, communities, to, revolt, or, resettle, in, mountainous, areas, of, sicily, these, revolts, resulted, in, some, acts, of, violence, and, the, eventual, deportation, of, muslims, which, began, under, frederick, ii, eventually, the, government, removed, the, entire, muslim, population, to, lucera, in, apulia, and, girifalco, in, calabria, where, they, paid, taxes, and, served, as, agricultural, laborers, craftsmen, and, crossbowmen, for, the, benefit, of, the, king, the, colony, at,
