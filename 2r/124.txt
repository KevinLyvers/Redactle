the, tarim, basin, modern, day, xinjiang, china, the, name, tocharian, was, given, to, these, languages, in, the, early, 20th, century, by, scholars, who, identified, their, speakers, with, a, people, known, in, ancient, greek, sources, as, the, t, kharoi, latin, tochari, who, inhabited, bactria, from, the, 2nd, century, bc, this, identification, is, now, generally, considered, erroneous, but, the, name, tocharian, remains, the, most, common, term, for, the, languages, and, their, speakers, their, actual, ethnic, name, is, unknown, although, they, may, have, referred, to, themselves, as, the, agni, ku, i, and, kror, n, or, as, the, agniya, and, kuchiya, known, from, sanskrit, texts, agricultural, communities, first, appeared, in, the, oases, of, the, northern, tarim, circa, 2000, bc, some, scholars, have, linked, these, communities, to, the, afanasievo, culture, found, earlier, c, 3500, 2500, bc, in, siberia, north, of, the, tarim, or, central, asian, bmac, culture, the, earliest, tarim, mummies, date, from, c, 1800, bc, but, it, is, unclear, whether, they, are, connected, to, the, tocharians, of, two, millennia, later, by, the, 2nd, century, bc, these, settlements, had, developed, into, city, states, overshadowed, by, nomadic, peoples, to, the, north, and, chinese, empires, to, the, east, these, cities, the, largest, of, which, was, kucha, also, served, as, way, stations, on, the, branch, of, the, silk, road, that, ran, along, the, northern, edge, of, the, taklamakan, desert, for, several, centuries, the, tarim, basin, was, ruled, by, the, xiongnu, the, han, dynasty, the, tibetan, empire, and, the, tang, dynasty, from, the, 8th, century, ad, the, uyghurs, speakers, of, a, turkic, language, settled, in, the, region, and, founded, the, kingdom, of, qocho, that, ruled, the, tarim, basin, the, peoples, of, the, tarim, city, states, intermixed, with, the, uyghurs, whose, old, uyghur, language, spread, through, the, region, the, tocharian, languages, are, believed, to, have, become, extinct, during, the, 9th, century, around, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, archaeologists, recovered, a, number, of, manuscripts, from, oases, in, the, tarim, basin, written, in, two, closely, related, but, previously, unknown, indo, european, languages, which, were, easy, to, read, because, they, used, a, close, variation, of, the, already, deciphered, indian, middle, brahmi, script, these, languages, were, designated, in, similar, fashion, by, their, geographical, neighbours, friedrich, w, k, m, ller, was, the, first, to, propose, a, characterization, for, the, newly, discovered, languages, m, ller, called, the, languages, tocharian, german, tocharisch, linking, this, toxr, t, ry, togari, with, the, ethnonym, t, kharoi, ancient, greek, applied, by, strabo, to, one, of, the, scythian, tribes, from, the, country, on, the, other, side, of, the, iaxartes, that, overran, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, present, day, afghanistan, in, the, second, half, of, the, 2nd, century, bc, this, term, also, appears, in, indo, iranian, languages, sanskrit, tushara, tukh, ra, old, persian, tux, ri, khotanese, ttahv, ra, and, became, the, source, of, the, term, tokharistan, usually, referring, to, 1st, millennium, bactria, as, well, as, the, takhar, province, of, afghanistan, the, t, kharoi, are, often, identified, by, modern, scholars, with, the, yuezhi, of, chinese, historical, accounts, who, founded, the, kushan, empire, m, ller, s, identification, became, a, minority, position, among, scholars, when, it, turned, out, that, the, people, of, tokharistan, bactria, spoke, bactrian, an, eastern, iranian, language, which, is, quite, distinct, from, the, tocharian, languages, nevertheless, tocharian, remained, the, standard, term, for, the, languages, of, the, tarim, basin, manuscripts, and, for, the, people, who, produced, them, a, few, scholars, argue, that, the, yuezhi, were, originally, speakers, of, tocharian, who, later, adopted, the, bactrian, language, the, name, of, kucha, in, tocharian, b, was, ku, i, with, adjectival, form, ku, i, e, the, word, may, be, derived, from, proto, indo, european, keuk, shining, white, the, tocharian, b, word, ake, e, may, have, referred, to, people, of, agni, with, a, derivation, meaning, borderers, marchers, one, of, the, tocharian, a, texts, have, r, i, k, ntw, as, a, name, for, their, own, language, so, that, r, i, may, have, meant, agnean, though, monk, is, also, possible, tocharian, kings, apparently, gave, themselves, the, title, ktemts, soy, in, tocharian, b, an, equivalent, of, the, title, devaputra, son, of, god, of, the, kushans, the, tocharian, languages, are, known, from, around, 7600, documents, dating, from, about, 400, to, 1200, ad, found, at, 30, sites, in, the, northeast, tarim, area, the, manuscripts, are, written, in, two, distinct, but, closely, related, indo, european, languages, conventionally, known, as, tocharian, a, and, tocharian, b, according, to, glotto, chronological, data, tocharian, languages, are, closest, to, western, indo, european, languages, such, as, proto, germanic, or, proto, italian, and, being, devoid, of, satemization, predate, the, evolution, of, eastern, indo, european, languages, tocharian, a, agnean, or, east, tocharian, was, found, in, the, northeastern, oases, known, to, the, tocharians, as, r, i, later, agni, i, e, chinese, yanqi, modern, karasahr, and, turpan, including, khocho, or, qo, o, known, in, chinese, as, gaochang, some, 500, manuscripts, have, been, studied, in, detail, mostly, coming, from, buddhist, monasteries, many, authors, take, this, to, imply, that, tocharian, a, had, become, a, purely, literary, and, liturgical, language, by, the, time, of, the, manuscripts, but, it, may, be, that, the, surviving, documents, are, unrepresentative, tocharian, b, kuchean, or, west, tocharian, was, found, at, all, the, tocharian, a, sites, and, also, in, several, sites, further, west, including, kuchi, later, kucha, it, appears, to, have, still, been, in, use, in, daily, life, at, that, time, over, 3200, manuscripts, have, been, studied, in, detail, the, languages, had, significant, differences, in, phonology, morphology, and, vocabulary, making, them, mutually, unintelligible, at, least, as, much, as, modern, germanic, or, romance, languages, tocharian, a, shows, innovations, in, the, vowels, and, nominal, inflection, whereas, tocharian, b, has, changes, in, the, consonants, and, verbal, inflection, many, of, the, differences, in, vocabulary, between, the, languages, concern, buddhist, concepts, which, may, suggest, that, they, were, associated, with, different, buddhist, traditions, the, differences, indicate, that, they, diverged, from, a, common, ancestor, between, 500, and, 1000, years, before, the, earliest, documents, that, is, sometime, in, the, 1st, millennium, bc, common, indo, european, vocabulary, retained, in, tocharian, includes, words, for, herding, cattle, sheep, pigs, dogs, horses, textiles, farming, wheat, gold, silver, and, wheeled, vehicles, prakrit, documents, from, 3rd, century, kror, n, andir, and, niya, on, the, southeast, edge, of, the, tarim, basin, contain, around, 100, loanwords, and, 1000, proper, names, that, cannot, be, traced, to, an, indic, or, iranian, source, thomas, burrow, suggested, that, they, come, from, a, variety, of, tocharian, dubbed, tocharian, c, or, kror, nian, which, may, have, been, spoken, by, at, least, some, of, the, local, populace, burrow, s, theory, is, widely, accepted, but, the, evidence, is, meagre, and, inconclusive, and, some, scholars, favour, alternative, explanations, most, of, the, tocharian, inscriptions, are, based, on, buddhist, monastic, texts, which, suggests, that, the, tocharians, largely, embraced, buddhism, the, pre, buddhist, beliefs, of, the, tocharians, are, largely, unknown, but, several, chinese, goddesses, are, similar, to, the, reconstructed, proto, indo, european, sun, goddess, and, the, dawn, goddess, which, implies, that, the, chinese, were, influenced, by, the, pre, buddhist, beliefs, of, the, tocharians, when, they, traveled, on, trade, routes, which, were, located, in, tocharian, territories, tocharian, b, has, a, noun, sw, co, derived, from, the, name, of, the, proto, indo, european, sun, goddess, while, tocharian, a, has, ko, a, loanword, etymologically, connected, to, the, turkic, sun, goddess, gun, ana, besides, this, they, might, have, also, worshipped, a, lunar, deity, me, and, an, earth, one, ke, the, murals, found, in, the, tarim, basin, especially, those, of, the, kizil, caves, mostly, depict, jataka, stories, avadanas, and, legends, of, the, buddha, and, are, an, artistic, representation, in, the, tradition, of, the, hinayana, school, of, the, sarvastivadas, when, the, chinese, monk, xuanzang, visited, kucha, in, 630, ad, he, received, the, favours, of, the, tocharian, king, suvarnadeva, the, son, and, successor, of, suvarnapushpa, whom, he, described, as, a, believer, of, hinayana, buddhism, in, the, account, of, his, travel, to, kucha, he, stated, that, there, are, about, one, hundred, convents, sa, gh, r, mas, in, this, country, with, five, thousand, and, more, disciples, these, belong, to, the, little, vehicle, of, the, school, of, the, sarv, stiv, das, zhuyiqieyoubu, their, doctrine, teaching, of, s, tras, and, their, rules, of, discipline, principles, of, the, vinaya, are, like, those, of, india, and, those, who, read, them, use, the, same, originals, the, route, by, which, speakers, of, indo, european, languages, reached, the, tarim, basin, is, uncertain, a, leading, contender, is, the, afanasievo, culture, who, occupied, the, altai, region, to, the, north, between, 3300, and, 2500, bc, the, afanasievo, culture, resulted, from, an, eastern, offshoot, of, the, yamnaya, culture, originally, based, in, the, pontic, steppe, north, of, the, caucasus, mountains, the, afanasevo, culture, c, 3500, 2500, bc, displays, cultural, and, genetic, connections, with, the, indo, european, associated, cultures, of, the, central, asian, steppe, yet, predates, the, specifically, indo, iranian, associated, andronovo, culture, c, 2000, 900, bc, j, p, mallory, and, victor, h, mair, argued, that, the, tarim, basin, was, first, settled, by, proto, tocharian, speakers, from, an, eastern, offshoot, of, the, afanasievo, culture, who, migrated, to, the, south, and, occupied, the, northern, and, eastern, edges, of, the, basin, the, early, eastward, expansion, of, the, yamnaya, culture, circa, 3300, bc, is, enough, to, account, for, the, isolation, of, the, tocharian, languages, from, indo, iranian, linguistic, innovations, like, satemization, micha, l, peyrot, argues, that, several, of, the, most, striking, typological, peculiarities, of, tocharian, are, rooted, in, a, prolonged, contact, of, proto, tocharian, speaking, afanasievans, with, speakers, of, an, early, stage, of, proto, samoyedic, in, south, siberia, among, others, this, might, explain, the, merger, of, all, three, stop, series, e, g, t, d, d, t, which, must, have, led, to, a, huge, amount, of, homonyms, as, well, as, the, development, of, an, agglutinative, case, system, chao, ning, et, al, 2019, found, in, burials, from, around, 200, bc, at, the, shirenzigou, site, on, the, eastern, edge, of, dzungaria, 20, 80, yamnaya, like, ancestry, lending, support, to, the, hypothesis, of, a, migration, from, afanasievo, into, dzungaria, which, is, just, north, of, the, tarim, basin, according, to, archaeologist, alexey, kovalev, the, chemurchek, culture, 2750, 1900, bce, an, altaic, culture, with, many, similarities, with, cultures, of, western, europe, and, especially, southern, france, in, burial, and, statuary, styles, may, have, been, associated, with, the, proto, tokharians, according, to, glotto, chronological, data, proto, tokharians, must, have, migrated, to, the, east, around, the, same, period, and, their, western, indo, european, language, is, closest, to, proto, germanic, and, proto, italic, corresponding, to, the, broad, geographical, area, encompassing, southern, france, where, the, style, most, similar, to, those, of, the, chemurchek, culture, have, been, identified, the, language, of, the, chemurchek, proto, tokharians, may, have, originated, from, the, same, general, location, in, western, europe, as, did, their, burial, and, statuary, styles, the, taklamakan, desert, is, roughly, oval, in, shape, about, 1, 000, km, long, and, 400, km, wide, surrounded, on, three, sides, by, high, mountains, the, main, part, of, the, desert, is, sandy, surrounded, by, a, belt, of, gravel, desert, the, desert, is, completely, barren, but, in, the, late, spring, the, melting, snows, of, the, surrounding, mountains, feed, streams, which, have, been, altered, by, human, activity, to, create, oases, with, mild, microclimates, and, supporting, intensive, agriculture, on, the, northern, edge, of, the, basin, these, oases, occur, in, small, valleys, before, the, gravels, on, the, southern, edge, they, occur, in, alluvial, fans, on, the, edge, of, the, sand, zone, isolated, alluvial, fan, oases, also, occur, in, the, gravel, deserts, of, the, turpan, depression, to, the, east, of, the, taklamakan, from, around, 2000, bc, these, oases, supported, bronze, age, settled, agricultural, communities, of, steadily, increasing, sophistication, the, necessary, irrigation, technology, was, first, developed, during, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, in, the, bactria, margiana, archaeological, complex, bmac, to, the, west, of, the, pamir, mountains, but, it, is, unclear, how, it, reached, the, tarim, the, staple, crops, wheat, and, barley, also, originated, in, the, west, the, oldest, of, the, tarim, mummies, bodies, preserved, by, the, desert, conditions, date, from, 2000, bc, and, were, found, on, the, eastern, edge, of, the, tarim, basin, the, mummies, have, been, described, as, being, both, caucasoid, and, mongoloid, and, mixed, race, individuals, are, also, observed, a, genetic, study, of, remains, from, the, oldest, layer, of, the, xiaohe, cemetery, found, that, the, maternal, lineages, were, a, mixture, of, east, and, west, eurasian, types, while, all, the, paternal, lineages, were, of, west, eurasian, type, it, is, unknown, whether, they, are, connected, with, the, frescoes, painted, at, tocharian, sites, more, than, two, millennia, later, which, also, depict, light, eyes, and, hair, color, the, mummies, were, found, with, plaid, woven, tapestries, that, are, notably, similar, to, the, weaving, pattern, of, the, tartan, style, of, the, hallstatt, culture, of, central, europe, associated, with, celts, the, wool, used, in, the, tapestries, was, found, to, come, from, sheep, with, european, ancestry, a, 2021, genetic, study, demonstrated, that, the, tarim, mummies, were, unrelated, to, afanasievo, populations, and, instead, were, a, genetic, isolate, descending, mainly, from, ancient, north, eurasians, later, groups, of, nomadic, pastoralists, moved, from, the, steppe, into, the, grasslands, to, the, north, and, northeast, of, the, tarim, they, were, the, ancestors, of, peoples, later, known, to, chinese, authors, as, the, wusun, and, yuezhi, it, is, thought, that, at, least, some, of, them, spoke, iranian, languages, but, a, minority, of, scholars, suggest, that, the, yuezhi, were, tocharian, speakers, during, the, 1st, millennium, bc, a, further, wave, of, immigrants, the, saka, speaking, iranian, languages, arrived, from, the, west, and, settled, along, the, southern, rim, of, the, tarim, they, are, believed, to, be, the, source, of, iranian, loanwords, in, tocharian, languages, particularly, related, to, commerce, and, warfare, the, subeshi, culture, is, a, candidate, for, the, iron, age, predecessors, of, the, tocharians, the, first, record, of, the, oasis,

or, karashar, with, 32, 000, next, was, the, loulan, kingdom, kror, n, first, mentioned, in, 126, bc, chinese, histories, give, no, evidence, of, ethnic, changes, in, these, cities, between, that, time, and, the, period, of, the, tocharian, manuscripts, from, these, sites, situated, on, the, northern, and, southern, edges, of, the, tarim, these, small, urban, societies, were, overshadowed, by, nomadic, peoples, to, the, north, and, chinese, empires, to, the, east, they, became, the, object, of, rivalry, between, the, chinese, and, the, xiongnu, they, conceded, tributary, relations, with, the, larger, powers, when, required, and, acted, independently, when, they, could, in, 177, bc, the, xiongnu, drove, the, yuezhi, from, western, gansu, causing, most, of, them, to, flee, west, to, the, ili, valley, and, then, to, bactria, the, xiongnu, then, overcame, the, tarim, statelets, which, became, a, vital, part, of, their, empire, the, chinese, han, dynasty, was, determined, to, weaken, their, xiongnu, enemies, by, depriving, them, of, this, area, this, was, achieved, in, a, series, of, campaigns, beginning, in, 108, bc, and, culminating, in, the, establishment, of, the, protectorate, of, the, western, regions, in, 60, bc, under, zheng, ji, the, han, government, used, a, range, of, tactics, including, plots, to, assassinate, local, rulers, direct, attacks, on, a, few,
