the, covid, 19, pandemic, also, known, as, the, coronavirus, pandemic, caused, by, severe, acute, respiratory, syndrome, coronavirus, 2, sars, cov, 2, began, with, an, outbreak, of, covid, 19, in, wuhan, china, in, december, 2019, it, spread, to, other, areas, of, asia, and, then, worldwide, in, early, 2020, the, world, health, organization, who, declared, the, outbreak, a, public, health, emergency, of, international, concern, pheic, on, 30, january, 2020, and, assessed, the, outbreak, as, having, become, a, pandemic, on, 11, march, covid, 19, symptoms, range, from, asymptomatic, to, deadly, but, most, commonly, include, fever, sore, throat, nocturnal, cough, and, fatigue, transmission, of, the, virus, is, often, through, airborne, particles, mutations, have, produced, many, strains, variants, with, varying, degrees, of, infectivity, and, virulence, covid, 19, vaccines, were, developed, rapidly, and, deployed, to, the, general, public, beginning, in, december, 2020, made, available, through, government, and, international, programs, such, as, covax, aiming, to, provide, vaccine, equity, treatments, include, novel, antiviral, drugs, and, symptom, control, common, mitigation, measures, during, the, public, health, emergency, included, travel, restrictions, lockdowns, business, restrictions, and, closures, workplace, hazard, controls, mask, mandates, quarantines, testing, systems, and, contact, tracing, of, the, infected, the, pandemic, caused, severe, social, and, economic, disruption, around, the, world, including, the, largest, global, recession, since, the, great, depression, widespread, supply, shortages, including, food, shortages, were, caused, by, supply, chain, disruptions, and, panic, buying, reduced, human, activity, led, to, an, unprecedented, temporary, decrease, in, pollution, educational, institutions, and, public, areas, were, partially, or, fully, closed, in, many, jurisdictions, and, many, events, were, cancelled, or, postponed, during, 2020, and, 2021, telework, became, much, more, common, for, white, collar, workers, as, the, pandemic, evolved, misinformation, circulated, through, social, media, and, mass, media, and, political, tensions, intensified, the, pandemic, raised, issues, of, racial, and, geographic, discrimination, health, equity, and, the, balance, between, public, health, imperatives, and, individual, rights, the, who, ended, the, pheic, for, covid, 19, on, 5, may, 2023, the, disease, has, continued, to, circulate, but, as, of, 2024, experts, were, uncertain, as, to, whether, it, was, still, a, pandemic, pandemics, and, their, ends, are, not, well, defined, and, whether, or, not, one, has, ended, differs, according, to, the, definition, used, as, of, 17, august, 2024, covid, 19, has, caused, 7, 057, 132, confirmed, deaths, the, covid, 19, pandemic, ranks, as, the, fifth, deadliest, pandemic, or, epidemic, in, history, in, epidemiology, a, pandemic, is, defined, as, an, epidemic, occurring, over, a, very, wide, area, crossing, international, boundaries, and, usually, affecting, a, large, number, of, people, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, as, with, other, pandemics, the, meaning, of, this, term, has, been, challenged, the, end, of, a, pandemic, or, other, epidemic, only, rarely, involves, the, total, disappearance, of, a, disease, and, historically, much, less, attention, has, been, given, to, defining, the, ends, of, epidemics, than, their, beginnings, the, ends, of, particular, epidemics, have, been, defined, in, a, variety, of, ways, differing, according, to, academic, field, and, differently, based, on, location, and, social, group, an, epidemic, s, end, can, be, considered, a, social, phenomenon, not, just, a, biological, one, this, means, that, it, is, possible, for, the, pandemic, to, have, ended, according, to, one, definition, e, g, according, to, a, definition, based, on, how, people, behave, and, still, be, ongoing, according, to, another, definition, e, g, according, to, a, definition, based, on, the, number, of, infections, during, the, initial, outbreak, in, wuhan, the, virus, and, disease, were, commonly, referred, to, as, coronavirus, wuhan, coronavirus, the, coronavirus, outbreak, and, the, wuhan, coronavirus, outbreak, with, the, disease, sometimes, called, wuhan, pneumonia, in, january, 2020, the, who, recommended, 2019, ncov, and, 2019, ncov, acute, respiratory, disease, as, interim, names, for, the, virus, and, disease, per, 2015, international, guidelines, against, using, geographical, locations, e, g, wuhan, china, animal, species, or, groups, of, people, in, disease, and, virus, names, in, part, to, prevent, social, stigma, who, finalized, the, official, names,

virus, closely, related, to, bat, coronaviruses, pangolin, coronaviruses, and, sars, cov, the, first, known, outbreak, the, 2019, 2020, covid, 19, outbreak, in, mainland, china, started, in, wuhan, hubei, china, in, december, 2019, many, early, cases, were, linked, to, people, who, had, visited, the, huanan, seafood, wholesale, market, there, but, it, is, possible, that, human, to, human, transmission, began, earlier, molecular, clock, analysis, suggests, that, the, first, cases, were, likely, to, have, been, between, october, and, november, 2019, the, scientific, consensus, is, that, the, virus, is, most, likely, of, a, zoonotic, origin, from, bats, or, another, closely, related, mammal, while, other, explanations, such, as, speculations, that, sars, cov, 2, was, accidentally, released, from, a, laboratory, have, been, proposed, as, of, 2021, these, were, not, supported, by, evidence, official, case, counts, refer, to, the, number, of, people, who, have, been, tested, for, covid, 19, and, whose, test, has, been, confirmed, positive, according, to, official, protocols, whether, or, not, they, experienced, symptomatic, disease, due, to, the, effect, of, sampling, bias, studies, which, obtain, a, more, accurate, number, by, extrapolating, from, a, random, sample, have, consistently, found, that, total, infections, considerably, exceed, the, reported, case, counts, many, countries, early, on, had, official, policies, to, not, test, those, with, only, mild, symptoms, the, strongest, risk, factors, for, severe, illness, are, obesity, complications, of, diabetes, anxiety, disorders, and, the, total, number, of, conditions, during, the, start, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, it, was, not, clear, whether, young, people, were, less, likely, to, be, infected, or, less, likely, to, develop, symptoms, and, be, tested, a, retrospective, cohort, study, in, china, found, that, children, and, adults, were, just, as, likely, to, be, infected, among, more, thorough, studies, preliminary, results, from, 9, april, 2020, found, that, in, gangelt, the, centre, of, a, major, infection, cluster, in, germany, 15, percent, of, a, population, sample, tested, positive, for, antibodies, screening, for, covid, 19, in, pregnant, women, in, new, york, city, and, blood, donors, in, the, netherlands, found, rates, of, positive, antibody, tests, that, indicated, more, infections, than, reported, seroprevalence, based, estimates, are, conservative, as, some, studies, show, that, persons, with, mild, symptoms, do, not, have, detectable, antibodies, initial, estimates, of, the, basic, reproduction, number, r, 0, for, covid, 19, in, january, 2020, were, between, 1, 4, and, 2, 5, but, a, subsequent, analysis, claimed, that, it, may, be, about, 5, 7, with, a, 95, percent, confidence, interval, of, 3, 8, to, 8, 9, in, december, 2021, the, number, of, cases, continued, to, climb, due, to, several, factors, including, new, covid, 19, variants, as, of, that, 28, december, 282, 790, 822, individuals, worldwide, had, been, confirmed, as, infected, as, of, 14, april, 2022, over, 500, million, cases, were, confirmed, globally, most, cases, are, unconfirmed, with, the, institute, for, health, metrics, and, evaluation, estimating, the, true, number, of, cases, as, of, early, 2022, to, be, in, the, billions, as, of, 10, march, 2023, more, than, 6, 88, million, deaths, had, been, attributed, to, covid, 19, the, first, confirmed, death, was, in, wuhan, on, 9, january, 2020, these, numbers, vary, by, region, and, over, time, influenced, by, testing, volume, healthcare, system, quality, treatment, options, government, response, time, since, the, initial, outbreak, and, population, characteristics, such, as, age, sex, and, overall, health, multiple, measures, are, used, to, quantify, mortality, official, death, counts, typically, include, people, who, died, after, testing, positive, such, counts, exclude, deaths, without, a, test, conversely, deaths, of, people, who, died, from, underlying, conditions, following, a, positive, test, may, be, included, countries, such, as, belgium, include, deaths, from, suspected, cases, including, those, without, a, test, thereby, increasing, counts, official, death, counts, have, been, claimed, to, underreport, the, actual, death, toll, because, excess, mortality, the, number, of, deaths, in, a, period, compared, to, a, long, term, average, data, show, an, increase, in, deaths, that, is, not, explained, by, covid, 19, deaths, alone, using, such, data, estimates, of, the, true, number, of, deaths, from, covid, 19, worldwide, have, included, a, range, from, 18, 2, to, 33, 5, million, 27, 4, million, by, 18, november, 2023, by, the, economist, as, well, as, over, 18, 5, million, by, 1, april, 2023, by, the, institute, for, health, metrics, and, evaluation, and, 18, 2, million, earlier, deaths, between, 1, january, 2020, and, 31, december, 2021, by, a, comprehensive, international, study, such, deaths, include, deaths, due, to, healthcare, capacity, constraints, and, priorities, as, well, as, reluctance, to, seek, care, to, avoid, possible, infection, further, research, may, help, distinguish, the, proportions, directly, caused, by, covid, 19, from, those, caused, by, indirect, consequences, of, the, pandemic, in, may, 2022, the, who, estimated, the, number, of, excess, deaths, by, the, end, of, 2021, to, be, 14, 9, million, compared, to, 5, 4, million, reported, covid, 19, deaths, with, the, majority, of, the, unreported, 9, 5, million, deaths, believed, to, be, direct, deaths, due, the, virus, rather, than, indirect, deaths, some, deaths, were, because, people, with, other, conditions, could, not, access, medical, services, a, december, 2022, who, study, estimated, excess, deaths, from, the, pandemic, during, 2020, and, 2021, again, concluding, 14, 8, million, excess, early, deaths, occurred, reaffirming, and, detailing, their, prior, calculations, from, may, as, well, as, updating, them, addressing, criticisms, these, numbers, do, not, include, measures, like, years, of, potential, life, lost, and, may, make, the, pandemic, 2021, s, leading, cause, of, death, the, time, between, symptom, onset, and, death, ranges, from, 6, to, 41, days, typically, about, 14, days, mortality, rates, increase, as, a, function, of, age, people, at, the, greatest, mortality, risk, are, the, elderly, and, those, with, underlying, conditions, the, infection, fatality, ratio, ifr, is, the, cumulative, number, of, deaths, attributed, to, the, disease, divided, by, the, cumulative, number, of, infected, individuals, including, asymptomatic, and, undiagnosed, infections, and, excluding, vaccinated, infected, individuals, it, is, expressed, in, percentage, points, other, studies, refer, to, this, metric, as, the, infection, fatality, risk, in, november, 2020, a, review, article, in, nature, reported, estimates, of, population, weighted, ifrs, for, various, countries, excluding, deaths, in, elderly, care, facilities, and, found, a, median, range, of, 0, 24, to, 1, 49, ifrs, rise, as, a, function, of, age, from, 0, 002, at, age, 10, and, 0, 01, at, age, 25, to, 0, 4, at, age, 55, 1, 4, at, age, 65, 4, 6, at, age, 75, and, 15, at, age, 85, these, rates, vary, by, a, factor, of, 10, 000, across, the, age, groups, for, comparison, the, ifr, for, middle, aged, adults, is, two, orders, of, magnitude, higher, than, the, annualised, risk, of, a, fatal, automobile, accident, and, much, higher, than, the, risk, of, dying, from, seasonal, influenza, in, december, 2020, a, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, estimated, that, population, weighted, ifr, was, 0, 5, to, 1, in, some, countries, france, netherlands, new, zealand, and, portugal, 1, to, 2, in, other, countries, australia, england, lithuania, and, spain, and, about, 2, 5, in, italy, this, study, reported, that, most, of, the, differences, reflected, corresponding, differences, in, the, population, s, age, structure, and, the, age, specific, pattern, of, infections, there, have, also, been, reviews, that, have, compared, the, fatality, rate, of, this, pandemic, with, prior, pandemics, such, as, mers, cov, for, comparison, the, infection, mortality, rate, of, seasonal, flu, in, the, united, states, is, 0, 1, which, is, 13, times, lower, than, covid, 19, another, metric, in, assessing, death, rate, is, the, case, fatality, ratio, cfr, which, is, the, ratio, of, deaths, to, diagnoses, this, metric, can, be, misleading, because, of, the, delay, between, symptom, onset, and, death, and, because, testing, focuses, on, symptomatic, individuals, based, on, johns, hopkins, university, statistics, the, global, cfr, was, 1, 02, percent, 6, 881, 955, deaths, for, 676, 609, 955, cases, as, of, 10, march, 2023, the, number, varies, by, region, and, has, generally, declined, over, time, several, variants, have, been, named, by, who, and, labelled, as, a, variant, of, concern, voc, or, a, variant, of, interest, voi, many, of, these, variants, have, shared, the, more, infectious, d614g, as, of, may, 2023, the, who, had, downgraded, all, variants, of, concern, to, previously, circulating, as, these, were, no, longer, detected, in, new, infections, sub, lineages, of, the, omicron, variant, ba, 1, ba, 5, were, considered, separate, vocs, by, the, who, until, they, were, downgraded, in, march, 2023, as, no, longer, widely, circulating, symptoms, of, covid, 19, are, variable, ranging, from, mild, symptoms, to, severe, illness, common, symptoms, include, headache, loss, of, smell, and, taste, nasal, congestion, and, runny, nose, cough, muscle, pain, sore, throat, fever, diarrhoea, and, breathing, difficulties, people, with, the, same, infection, may, have, different, symptoms, and, their, symptoms, may, change, over, time, three, common, clusters, of, symptoms, have, been, identified, one, respiratory, symptom, cluster, with, cough, sputum, shortness, of, breath, and, fever, a, musculoskeletal, symptom, cluster, with, muscle, and, joint, pain, headache, and, fatigue, a, cluster, of, digestive, symptoms, with, abdominal, pain, vomiting, and, diarrhoea, in, people, without, prior, ear, nose, and, throat, disorders, loss, of, taste, combined, with, loss, of, smell, is, associated, with, covid, 19, and, is, reported, in, as, many, as, 88, of, cases, the, disease, is, mainly, transmitted, via, the, respiratory, route, when, people, inhale, droplets, and, small, airborne, particles, that, form, an, aerosol, that, infected, people, exhale, as, they, breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or, sing, infected, people, are, more, likely, to, transmit, covid, 19, when, they, are, physically, close, to, other, non, infected, individuals, however, infection, can, occur, over, longer, distances, particularly, indoors, sars, cov, 2, belongs, to, the, broad, family, of, viruses, known, as, coronaviruses, it, is, a, positive, sense, single, stranded, rna, ssrna, virus, with, a, single, linear, rna, segment, coronaviruses, infect, humans, other, mammals, including, livestock, and, companion, animals, and, avian, species, human, coronaviruses, are, capable, of, causing, illnesses, ranging, from, the, common, cold, to, more, severe, diseases, such, as, middle, east, respiratory, syndrome, mers, fatality, rate, 34, sars, cov, 2, is, the, seventh, known, coronavirus, to, infect, people, after, 229e, nl63, oc43, hku1, mers, cov, and, the, original, sars, cov, the, standard, method, of, testing, for, presence, of, sars, cov, 2, is, a, nucleic, acid, test, which, detects, the, presence, of, viral, rna, fragments, as, these, tests, detect, rna, but, not, infectious, virus, its, ability, to, determine, duration, of, infectivity, of, patients, is, limited, the, test, is, typically, done, on, respiratory, samples, obtained, by, a, nasopharyngeal, swab, however, a, nasal, swab, or, sputum, sample, may, also, be, used, the, who, has, published, several, testing, protocols, for, the, disease, preventive, measures, to, reduce, the, chances, of, infection, include, getting, vaccinated, staying, at, home, or, spending, more, time, outdoors, avoiding, crowded, places, keeping, distance, from, others, wearing, a, mask, in, public, ventilating, indoor, spaces, managing, potential, exposure, durations, washing, hands, with, soap, and, water, often, and, for, at, least, twenty, seconds, practicing, good, respiratory, hygiene, and, avoiding, touching, the, eyes, nose, or, mouth, with, unwashed, hands, those, diagnosed, with, covid, 19, or, who, believe, they, may, be, infected, are, advised, by, healthcare, authorities, to, stay, home, except, to, get, medical, care, call, ahead, before, visiting, a, healthcare, provider, wear, a, face, mask, before, entering, the, healthcare, provider, s, office, and, when, in, any, room, or, vehicle, with, another, person, cover, coughs, and, sneezes, with, a, tissue, regularly, wash, hands, with, soap, and, water, and, avoid, sharing, personal, household, items, a, covid, 19, vaccine, is, intended, to, provide, acquired, immunity, against, severe, acute, respiratory, syndrome, coronavirus, 2, sars, cov, 2, the, virus, that, causes, coronavirus, disease, 2019, covid, 19, prior, to, the, covid, 19, pandemic, an, established, body, of, knowledge, existed, about, the, structure, and, function, of, coronaviruses, causing, diseases, like, severe, acute, respiratory, syndrome, sars, and, middle, east, respiratory, syndrome, mers, this, knowledge, accelerated, the, development, of, various, vaccine, platforms, during, early, 2020, the, initial, focus, of, sars, cov, 2, vaccines, was, on, preventing, symptomatic, and, severe, illness, the, covid, 19, vaccines, are, widely, credited, for, their, role, in, reducing, the, severity, and, death, caused, by, covid, 19, as, of, march, 2023, more, than, 5, 5, billion, people, had, received, one, or, more, doses, 11, 8, billion, in, total, in, over, 197, countries, the, oxford, astrazeneca, vaccine, was, the, most, widely, used, according, to, a, june, 2022, study, covid, 19, vaccines, prevented, an, additional, 14, 4, million, to, 19, 8, million, deaths, in, 185, countries, and, territories, from, 8, december, 2020, to, 8, december, 2021, on, 8, november, 2022, the, first, recombinant, protein, based, covid, 19, vaccine, novavax, s, booster, nuvaxovid, was, authorized, for, use, in, adults, in, the, united, kingdom, it, has, subsequently, received, endorsement, authorization, from, the, who, us, european, union, and, australia, on, 12, november, 2022, the, who, released, its, global, vaccine, market, report, the, report, indicated, that, inequitable, distribution, is, not, unique, to, covid, 19, vaccines, countries, that, are, not, economically, strong, struggle, to, obtain, vaccines, on, 14, november, 2022, the, first, inhalable, vaccine, was, introduced, developed, by, chinese, biopharmaceutical, company, cansino, biologics, in, the, city, of, shanghai, china, for, the, first, two, years, of, the, pandemic, no, specific, and, effective, treatment, or, cure, was, available, in, 2021, the, european, medicines, agency, s, ema, committee, for, medicinal, products, for, human, use, chmp, approved, the, oral, antiviral,

available, in, the, us, canada, australia, and, several, other, countries, with, varying, restrictions, however, it, is, not, recommended, for, use, with, mechanical, ventilation, and, is, discouraged, altogether, by, the, world, health, organization, who, due, to, limited, evidence, of, its, efficacy, the, severity, of, covid, 19, varies, it, may, take, a, mild, course, with, few, or, no, symptoms, resembling, other, common, upper, respiratory, diseases, such, as, the, common, cold, in, 3, 4, of, cases, 7, 4, for, those, over, age, 65, symptoms, are, severe, enough, to, cause,

characterized, by, long, term, consequences, persisting, after, the, typical, convalescence, period, of, the, disease, the, most, commonly, reported, clinical, presentations, are, fatigue, and, memory, problems, as, well, as, malaise, headaches, shortness, of, breath, loss, of, smell, muscle, weakness, low, fever, and, cognitive, dysfunction, many, countries, attempted, to, slow, or, stop, the, spread, of, covid, 19, by, recommending, mandating, or, prohibiting, behaviour, changes, while, others, relied, primarily, on, providing, information, measures, ranged, from, public, advisories, to, stringent, lockdowns, outbreak, control, strategies, are, divided, into, elimination, and, mitigation, experts, differentiate, between, elimination, strategies, known, as, zero, covid, that, aim, to, completely, stop, the, spread, of, the, virus, within, the, community, and, mitigation, strategies, commonly, known, as, flattening, the, curve, that, attempt, to, lessen, the, effects, of, the, virus, on, society, but, which, still, tolerate, some, level, of, transmission, within, the, community, these, initial, strategies, can, be, pursued, sequentially, or, simultaneously, during, the, acquired, immunity, phase, through, natural, and, vaccine, induced, immunity, nature, reported, in, 2021, that, 90, percent, of, researchers, who, responded, to, a, survey, think, that, the, coronavirus, will, become, endemic, containment, is, undertaken, to, stop, an, outbreak, from, spreading, into, the, general, population, infected, individuals, are, isolated, while, they, are, infectious, the, people, they, have, interacted, with, are, contacted, and, isolated, for, long, enough, to, ensure, that, they, are, either, not, infected, or, no, longer, contagious, screening, is, the, starting, point, for, containment, screening, is, done, by, checking, for, symptoms, to, identify, infected, individuals, who, can, then, be, isolated, or, offered, treatment, the, zero, covid,

mainland, europe, the, b, yamagata, lineage, of, influenza, b, might, have, become, extinct, in, 2020, 2021, due, to, covid, 19, pandemic, measures, there, have, been, no, naturally, occurring, cases, confirmed, since, march, 2020, in, 2023, the, world, health, organization, concluded, that, protection, against, the, yamagata, lineage, was, no, longer, necessary, in, the, seasonal, flu, vaccine, reducing, the, number, of, lineages, targeted, by, the, vaccine, from, four, to, three, the, pandemic, and, the, reaction, to, it, positively, affected, the, environment, and, climate, as, a, result, of, reduced, human, activity, during, the, anthropause, fossil, fuel, use, decreased, resource, consumption, declined, and, waste, disposal, improved, generating, less, pollution, planned, air, travel, and, vehicle, transportation, declined, in, china, lockdowns, and, other, measures, resulted, in, a, 26, decrease, in, coal, consumption, and, a, 50, reduction, in, nitrogen, oxides, emissions, in, 2020, a, worldwide, study, on, mammalian, wildlife, responses, to, human, presence, during, covid, lockdowns, found, complex, patterns, of, animal, behavior, carnivores, were, generally, less, active, when, humans, were, around, while, herbivores, in, developed, areas, were, more, active, among, other, findings, this, suggested, that, herbivores, may, view, humans, as, a, shield, against, predators, highlighting, the, importance, of, location, and, human, presence, history, in, understanding, wildlife, responses, to, changes, in, human, activity, in, a, given, area, a, wide, variety, of, largely, mammalian, species, both, captive, and, wild, have, been, shown, to, be, susceptible, to, sars, cov, 2, with, some, encountering, a, particularly, high, degree, of, fatal, outcomes, in, particular, both, farmed, and, wild, mink, have, developed, highly, symptomatic, and, severe, covid, 19, infections, with, a, mortality, rate, as, high, as, 35, 55, according, to, one, study, white, tailed, deer, on, the, other, hand, have, largely, avoided, severe, outcomes, but, have, effectively, become, natural, reservoirs, of, the, virus, with, large, numbers, of, free, ranging, deer, infected, throughout, the, us, and, canada, including, approximately, 80, of, iowa, s, wild, deer, herd, an, august, 2023, study, appeared, to, confirm, the, status, of, white, tailed, deer, as, a, disease, reservoir, noting, that, the, viral, evolution, of, sars, cov, 2, in, deer, occurs, at, triple, the, rate, of, its, evolution, in, humans, and, that, infection, rates, remained, high, even, in, areas, rarely, frequented, by, humans, heightened, prejudice, xenophobia, and, racism, toward, people, of, chinese, and, east, asian, descent, were, documented, around, the, world, reports, from, february, 2020, when, most, confirmed, cases, were, confined, to, china, cited, racist, sentiments, about, chinese, people, deserving, the, virus, individuals, of, asian, descent, in, europe, and, north, america, reported, increasing, instances, of, racially, motivated, abuse, and, assaults, as, a, result, of, the, pandemic, us, president, donald, trump, was, criticised, for, referring, to, sars, cov, 2, as, the, chinese, virus, and, kung, flu, terms, which, were, condemned, as, being, racist, and, xenophobic, age, based, discrimination, against, older, adults, increased, during, the, pandemic, this, was, attributed, to, their, perceived, vulnerability, and, subsequent, physical, and, social, isolation, measures, which, coupled, with, their, reduced, social, activity, increased, dependency, on, others, similarly, limited, digital, literacy, left, the, elderly, more, vulnerable, to, isolation, depression, and, loneliness, in, a, correspondence, published, in, the, lancet, in, 2021, german, epidemiologist, g, nter, kampf, described, the, harmful, effects, of, inappropriate, stigmatisation, of, unvaccinated, people, who, include, our, patients, colleagues, and, other, fellow, citizens, noting, the, evidence, that, vaccinated, individuals, play, a, large, role, in, transmission, american, bioethicist, arthur, caplan, responded, to, kampf, writing, criticising, who, wind, up, in, hospitals, and, morgues, in, huge, numbers, put, stress, on, finite, resources, and, prolong, the, pandemic, is, not, stigmatising, it, is, deserved, moral, condemnation, in, january, 2022, amnesty, international, urged, italy, to, change, their, anti, covid, 19, restrictions, to, avoid, discrimination, against, unvaccinated, people, saying, that, the, government, must, continue, to, ensure, that, the, entire, population, can, enjoy, its, fundamental, rights, the, restrictions, included, mandatory, vaccination, over, the, age, of, 50, and, mandatory, vaccination, to, use, public, transport, the, pandemic, triggered, massive, changes, in, behaviour, from, increased, internet, commerce, to, cultural, changes, in, the, workplace, online,

implementing, measures, to, address, covid, 19, in, the, workplace, a, poll, from, catalyst, found, that, as, many, as, 68, of, employees, around, the, world, felt, that, these, policies, were, only, performative, and, not, genuine, the, pandemic, led, to, a, surge, in, remote, work, according, to, a, gallup, poll, only, 4, of, us, employees, were, fully, remote, before, the, pandemic, compared, to, 43, in, may, 2020, among, white, collar, workers, that, shift, was, more, pronounced, with, 6, increasing, to, 65, in, the, same, period, that, trend, continued, in, later, stages, of, the, pandemic, with, many, workers, choosing, to, remain, remote, even, after, workplaces, reopened, many, nordic, european, and, asian, companies, increased, their, recruitment, of, international, remote, workers, even, as, the, pandemic, waned, partially, to, save, on, labor, costs, this, also, led, to, a, talent, drain, in, the, global, south, and, in, remote, areas, in, the, global, north, high, cost, of, living, and, dense, urban, areas, also, lost, office, real, estate, value, due, to, remote, worker, exodus, by, may, 2023, due, to, increasing, layoffs, and, concerns, over, productivity, some, white, collar, workplaces, in, the, us, had, resorted, to, performance, review, penalties, and, indirect, incentives, e, g, donations, to, charity, to, encourage, workers, to, return, to, the, office, a, 2021, study, noted, that, the, covid, 19, pandemic, had, increased, interest, in, epidemics, and, infectious, diseases, among, both, historians, and, the, general, public, prior, to, the, pandemic, these, topics, were, usually, overlooked, by, general, history, and, only, received, attention, in, the, history, of, medicine, many, comparisons, were, made, between, the, covid, 19, and, 1918, influenza, pandemics, including, the, development, of, anti, mask, movements, the, widespread, promotion, of, misinformation, and, the, impact, of, socioeconomic, disparities, in, some, areas, religious, groups, exacerbated, the, spread, of, the, virus, through, large, gatherings, and, the, dissemination, of, misinformation, some, religious, leaders, decried, what, they, saw, as, violations, of, religious, freedom, in, other, cases, religious, identity, was, a, beneficial, factor, for, health, increasing, compliance, with, public, health, measures, and, protecting, against, the, negative, effects, of, isolation, on, mental, wellbeing, some, news, organizations, removed, their, online, paywalls, for, some, or, all, of, their, pandemic, related, articles, and, posts, many, scientific, publishers, provided, pandemic, related, journal, articles, to, the, public, free, of, charge, as, part, of, the, national, institutes, of, health, s, covid, 19, public, health, emergency, initiative, according, to, one, estimate, from, researchers, at, the, university, of, rome, 89, 5, of, covid, 19, related, papers, were, open, access, compared, to, an, average, of, 48, 8, for, the, ten, most, deadly, human, diseases, the, share, of, papers, published, on, preprint, servers, prior, to, peer, review, increased, dramatically, misinformation, and, conspiracy, theories, about, the, pandemic, have, been, widespread, they, travel, through, mass, media, social, media, and, text, messaging, in, march, 2020, who, declared, an, infodemic, of, incorrect, information, cognitive, biases, such, as, confirmation, bias, are, linked, to, conspiracy, beliefs, including, covid, 19, vaccine, hesitancy, the, covid, 19, pandemic, had, a, major, impact, on, popular, culture, it, was, included, in, the, narratives, of, ongoing, pre, pandemic, television, series, and, become, a, central, narrative, in, new, ones, with, mixed, results, writing, for, the, new, york, times, about, the, then, upcoming, bbc, sitcom, pandemonium, on, 16, december, 2020, david, segal, asked, are, we, ready, to, laugh, about, covid, 19, or, rather, is, there, anything, amusing, or, recognizable, in, a, humorous, way, about, life, during, a, plague, with, all, of, its, indignities, and, setbacks, not, to, mention, its, rituals, and, rules, the, pandemic, had, driven, some, people, to, seek, peaceful, escapism, in, media, while, others, were, drawn, towards, fictional, pandemics, e, g, zombie, apocalypses, as, an, alternate, form, of, escapism, common, themes, have, included, contagion, isolation, and, loss, of, control, many, drew, comparisons, to, the, fictional, film, contagion, 2011, praising, its, accuracies, while, noting, some, differences, such, as, the, lack, of, an, orderly, vaccine, rollout, as, people, turned, to, music, to, relieve, emotions, evoked, by, the, pandemic, spotify, listenership, showed, that, classical, ambient, and, children, s, genres, grew, while, pop, country, and, dance, remained, relatively, stable, a, march, 2022, review, declared, a, transition, to, endemic, status, to, be, inevitable, in, june, 2022, an, article, in, human, genomics, said, that, the, pandemic, was, still, raging, but, that, now, is, the, time, to, explore, the, transition, from, the, pandemic, to, the, endemic, phase, another, review, that, month, predicted, that, the, virus, that, causes, covid, 19, would, become, the, fifth, endemic, seasonal, coronavirus, alongside, four, other, human, coronaviruses, a, february, 2023, review, of, the, four, common, cold, coronaviruses, concluded, that, the, virus, would, become, seasonal, and, like, the, common, cold, cause, less, severe, disease, for, most, people, another, 2023, review, stated, that, the, transition, to, endemic, covid, 19, may, take, years, or, decades, on, 5, may, 2023, the, who, declared, that, the, pandemic, was, no, longer, a, public, health, emergency, of, international, concern, this, led, several, media, outlets, to, incorrectly, report, that, this, meant, the, pandemic, was, over, the, who, commented, to, full, fact, that, it, was, unlikely, to, declare, the, pandemic, over, in, the, near, future, and, mentioned, cholera, which, it, considers, to, have, been, a, pandemic, since, 1961, i, e, continuously, for, the, last, 63, years, the, who, does, not, have, an, official, category, for, pandemics, or, make, declarations, of, when, pandemics, start, or, end, in, june, 2023, hans, kluge, director, of, the, who, in, europe, commented, that, while, the, international, public, health, emergency, may, have, ended, the, pandemic, certainly, has, not, the, who, in, europe, launched, a, transition, plan, to, manage, the, public, health, response, to, covid, 19, in, the, coming, years, and, prepare, for, possible, future, emergencies, epidemics, and, pandemics, usually, end, when, the, disease, becomes, endemic, and, when, the, disease, becomes, an, accepted, manageable, part, of, normal, life, in, a, given, society, as, of, march, 2024, there, was, no, widely, agreed, definition, of, when, a, disease, is, or, is, not, a, pandemic, though, efforts, at, a, formal, definition, were, underway, experts, asked, by, time, that, month, noted, that, covid, 19, continued, to, circulate, and, cause, disease, but, expressed, uncertainty, as, to, whether, it, should, still, be, described, as, a, pandemic, despite, strong, economic, rebounds, following, the, initial, lockdowns, in, early, 2020, towards, the, latter, phases, of, the, pandemic, many, countries, began, to, experience, long, term, economic, effects, several, countries, saw, high, inflation, rates, which, had, global, impacts, particularly, in, developing, countries, some, economic, impacts, such, as, supply, chain, and, trade, operations, were, seen, as, more, permanent, as, the, pandemic, exposed, major, weaknesses, in, these, systems, in, australia, the, pandemic, caused, an, increase, in, occupational, burnout, in, 2022, during, the, pandemic, a, large, percentage, of, workers, in, canada, came, to, prefer, working, from, home, which, had, an, impact, on, the, traditional, work, model, some, corporations, made, efforts, to, force, workers, to, return, to, work, on, site, while, some, embraced, the, idea, there, was, a, travel, boom, causing, air, travel, to, recover, at, rates, faster, than, anticipated, and, the, aviation, industry, became, profitable, in, 2023, for, the, first, time, since, 2019, before, the, pandemic, however, economic, issues, meant, some, predicted, that, the, boom, would, begin, to, slow, down, business, travel, on, airlines, was, still, below, pre, pandemic, levels, and, is, predicted, not, to, recover, an, increase, in, excess, deaths, from, underlying, causes, not, related, to, covid, 19, has, been, largely, blamed, on, systematic, issues, causing, delays, in, health, care, and, screening, during, the, pandemic, which, has, resulted, in, an, increase, of, non, covid, 19, related, deaths, during, the, pandemic, millions, of, children, missed, out, on, vaccinations, as, countries, focused, efforts, on, combating, covid, 19, efforts, were, made, to, increase, vaccination, rates, among, children, in, low, income, countries, these, efforts, were, successful, in, increasing, vaccination, rates, for, some, diseases, though, the, un, noted, that, post, pandemic, measles, vaccinations, were, still, falling, behind, some, of, the, decrease, in, immunization, was, driven, by, an, increase, in, mistrust, of, public, health, officials, this, was, seen, in, both, low, income, and, high, income, countries, several, african, countries, saw, a, decline, in, vaccinations, due, to, misinformation, around, the, pandemic, flowing, into, other, areas, immunization, rates, have, yet, to, recover, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom
