french, algeria, 19th, 20th, centuries, algerian, war, 1954, 1962, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, to, present, ancient, carthage, k, r, d, kar, thij, punic, lit, new, city, was, an, ancient, semitic, civilisation, based, in, north, africa, initially, a, settlement, in, present, day, tunisia, it, later, became, a, city, state, and, then, an, empire, founded, by, the, phoenicians, in, the, ninth, century, bc, carthage, reached, its, height, in, the, fourth, century, bc, as, one, of, the, largest, metropoleis, in, the, world, it, was, the, centre, of, the, carthaginian, empire, a, major, power, led, by, the, punic, people, who, dominated, the, ancient, western, and, central, mediterranean, sea, following, the, punic, wars, carthage, was, destroyed, by, the, romans, in, 146, bc, who, later, rebuilt, the, city, lavishly, carthage, was, settled, around, 814, bc, by, colonists, from, tyre, a, leading, phoenician, city, state, located, in, present, day, lebanon, in, the, 7th, century, bc, following, phoenicia, s, conquest, by, the, neo, assyrian, empire, carthage, became, independent, gradually, expanding, its, economic, and, political, hegemony, across, the, western, mediterranean, by, 300, bc, through, its, vast, patchwork, of, colonies, vassal, states, and, satellite, states, held, together, by, its, naval, dominance, of, the, western, and, central, mediterranean, sea, carthage, controlled, the, largest, territory, in, the, region, including, the, coast, of, northwest, africa, southern, and, eastern, iberia, and, the, islands, of, sicily, sardinia, corsica, malta, and, the, balearic, archipelago, tripoli, remained, autonomous, under, the, authority, of, local, libyco, phoenicians, who, paid, nominal, tribute, among, the, ancient, world, s, largest, and, richest, cities, carthage, s, strategic, location, provided, access, to, abundant, fertile, land, and, major, maritime, trade, routes, its, extensive, mercantile, network, reached, as, far, as, west, asia, and, northern, europe, providing, an, array, of, commodities, from, all, over, the, ancient, world, in, addition, to, lucrative, exports, of, agricultural, products, and, manufactured, goods, this, commercial, empire, was, secured, by, one, of, the, largest, and, most, powerful, navies, in, the, ancient, mediterranean, and, an, army, composed, heavily, of, foreign, mercenaries, and, auxiliaries, particularly, iberians, balearics, gauls, britons, sicilians, italians, greeks, numidians, and, libyans, as, the, dominant, power, of, the, western, mediterranean, carthage, inevitably, came, into, conflict, with, many, neighbours, and, rivals, from, the, berbers, of, north, africa, to, the, nascent, roman, republic, following, centuries, of, conflict, with, the, sicilian, greeks, its, growing, competition, with, rome, culminated, in, the, punic, wars, 264, 146, bc, which, saw, some, of, the, largest, and, most, sophisticated, battles, in, antiquity, carthage, narrowly, avoided, destruction, after, the, second, punic, war, but, was, destroyed, by, the, romans, in, 146, bc, after, the, third, punic, war, the, romans, later, founded, a, new, city, in, its, place, all, remnants, of, carthaginian, civilization, came, under, roman, rule, by, the, first, century, ad, and, rome, subsequently, became, the, dominant, mediterranean, power, paving, the, way, for, its, rise, as, a, major, empire, despite, the, cosmopolitan, character, of, its, empire, carthage, s, culture, and, identity, remained, rooted, in, its, canaanite, heritage, albeit, a, localised, variety, known, as, punic, like, other, phoenician, peoples, its, society, was, urban, commercial, and, oriented, towards, seafaring, and, trade, this, is, reflected, in, part, by, its, notable, innovations, including, serial, production, uncolored, glass, the, threshing, board, and, the, cothon, harbor, carthaginians, were, renowned, for, their, commercial, prowess, ambitious, explorations, and, unique, system, of, government, which, combined, elements, of, democracy, oligarchy, and, republicanism, including, modern, examples, of, checks, and, balances, despite, having, been, one, of, the, most, influential, civilizations, of, antiquity, carthage, is, mostly, remembered, for, its, long, and, bitter, conflict, with, rome, which, threatened, the, rise, of, the, roman, republic, and, almost, changed, the, course, of, western, civilization, due, to, the, destruction, of, virtually, all, carthaginian, texts, after, the, third, punic, war, much, of, what, is, known, about, its, civilization, comes, from, roman, and, greek, sources, many, of, whom, wrote, during, or, after, the, punic, wars, and, to, varying, degrees, were, shaped, by, the, hostilities, popular, and, scholarly, attitudes, towards, carthage, historically, reflected, the, prevailing, greco, roman, view, though, archaeological, research, since, the, late, 19th, century, has, helped, shed, more, light, and, nuance, on, carthaginian, civilization, the, name, carthage, k, r, d, is, the, early, modern, anglicisation, of, middle, french, carthage, kar, ta, from, latin, carth, g, and, karth, g, cf, greek, karkh, d, n, and, etruscan, car, aza, from, the, punic, qrt, d, t, punic, lit, new, city, punic, which, is, sometimes, used, synonymously, with, carthaginian, derives, from, the, latin, poenus, and, punicus, based, on, the, ancient, greek, word, phoinix, pl, phoinikes, an, exonym, used, to, describe, the, canaanite, port, towns, with, which, the, greeks, traded, latin, later, borrowed, the, greek, term, a, second, time, as, phoenix, pl, phoenices, both, punic, and, phoenician, were, used, by, the, romans, and, greeks, to, refer, to, phoenicians, across, the, mediterranean, modern, scholars, use, the, term, punic, exclusively, for, phoenicians, in, the, western, mediterranean, such, as, the, carthaginians, specific, punic, groups, are, often, referred, to, with, hyphenated, terms, like, siculo, punic, for, phoenicians, in, sicily, or, sardo, punic, for, those, in, sardinia, ancient, greek, authors, sometimes, referred, to, the, mixed, punic, inhabitants, of, north, africa, libya, as, liby, phoenicians, it, is, unclear, what, term, if, any, the, carthaginians, used, to, refer, to, themselves, the, phoenician, homeland, in, the, levant, was, natively, known, as, p, t, and, its, people, as, the, p, nnim, ancient, egyptian, accounts, suggest, the, people, from, the, region, identified, as, kenaani, or, kinaani, equivalent, to, canaanite, a, passage, from, augustine, has, often, been, interpreted, as, indicating, that, the, punic, speakers, in, north, africa, called, themselves, chanani, canaanites, but, it, has, recently, been, argued, that, this, is, a, misreading, numismatic, evidence, from, sicily, shows, that, some, western, phoenicians, made, use, of, the, term, phoinix, compared, to, contemporaneous, civilizations, such, as, rome, and, greece, far, less, is, known, about, carthage, as, most, indigenous, records, were, lost, in, the, wholesale, destruction, of, the, city, after, the, third, punic, war, sources, of, knowledge, are, limited, to, ancient, translations, of, punic, into, greek, and, latin, punic, inscriptions, on, monuments, and, buildings, and, archaeological, findings, of, carthage, s, material, culture, the, majority, of, available, primary, sources, about, carthage, were, written, by, greek, and, roman, historians, most, notably, livy, polybius, appian, cornelius, nepos, silius, italicus, plutarch, dio, cassius, and, herodotus, these, authors, came, from, cultures, that, were, nearly, always, in, competition, with, carthage, the, greeks, with, respect, to, sicily, and, the, romans, over, dominance, of, the, western, mediterranean, inevitably, foreign, accounts, of, carthage, usually, reflect, significant, bias, especially, those, written, during, or, after, the, punic, wars, when, the, interpretatio, romana, perpetuated, a, malicious, and, distorted, view, excavations, of, ancient, carthaginian, sites, since, the, late, 19th, century, has, brought, to, light, more, material, evidence, that, either, contradict, or, confirm, aspects, of, the, traditional, picture, of, carthage, however, many, of, these, findings, remain, ambiguous, the, specific, date, circumstances, and, motivations, concerning, carthage, s, founding, are, unknown, all, surviving, accounts, of, the, city, s, origins, come, from, latin, and, greek, literature, which, are, generally, legendary, in, nature, but, may, have, some, basis, in, fact, the, standard, foundation, myth, across, all, sources, is, that, the, city, was, founded, by, colonists, from, the, ancient, phoenician, city, state, of, tyre, led, by, its, exiled, princess, dido, also, known, as, queen, elissa, or, alissar, dido, s, brother, pygmalion, phoenician, pummayaton, had, murdered, her, husband, the, high, priest, of, the, city, and, taken, power, as, a, tyrant, dido, and, her, allies, escaped, his, reign, and, established, carthage, which, became, a, prosperous, city, under, her, rule, as, queen, several, scholars, have, identified, baa, li, maanzer, the, king, of, tyre, who, gave, tribute, to, shalmaneser, iii, in, 841, bc, with, ba, al, azor, phoenician, form, of, the, name, or, baal, eser, balazeros, greek, form, of, the, name, dido, s, grandfather, the, nora, stone, found, on, sardinia, has, been, interpreted, by, frank, moore, cross, as, naming, pygmalion, as, the, king, of, the, general, who, was, using, the, stone, to, record, his, victory, over, the, local, populace, on, paleographic, grounds, the, stone, is, dated, to, the, 9th, century, bc, cross, s, translation, with, a, longer, discussion, of, the, nora, stone, is, found, in, the, pygmalion, article, if, cross, s, interpretation, is, correct, this, presents, inscriptional, evidence, substantiating, the, existence, of, a, 9th, century, bc, king, of, tyre, named, in, greek, pygmalion, the, roman, historian, justin, writing, in, the, second, century, ad, provides, an, account, of, the, city, s, founding, based, on, the, earlier, work, of, trogus, princess, dido, is, the, daughter, of, king, belus, ii, of, tyre, who, upon, his, death, bequeaths, the, throne, jointly, to, her, and, her, brother, pygmalion, after, cheating, his, sister, out, of, her, share, of, political, power, pygmalion, murders, her, husband, acerbas, phoenician, zakarbaal, also, known, as, sychaeus, the, high, priest, of, melqart, whose, wealth, and, power, he, covets, before, her, tyrannical, brother, can, take, her, late, husband, s, wealth, dido, immediately, flees, with, her, followers, to, establish, a, new, city, abroad, upon, landing, in, north, africa, she, is, greeted, by, the, local, berber, chieftain, iarbas, also, called, hiarbas, who, promises, to, cede, as, much, land, as, could, be, covered, by, a, single, ox, hide, with, her, characteristic, cleverness, dido, cuts, the, hide, into, very, thin, strips, and, lays, them, end, to, end, until, they, encircle, the, entire, hill, of, byrsa, while, digging, to, set, the, foundation, of, their, new, settlement, the, tyrians, discover, the, head, of, an, ox, an, omen, that, the, city, would, be, wealthy, but, laborious, and, always, enslaved, in, response, they, move, the, site, of, the, city, elsewhere, where, the, head, of, a, horse, is, found, which, in, phoenician, culture, is, a, symbol, of, courage, and, conquest, the, horse, foretells, where, dido, s, new, city, will, rise, becoming, the, emblem, of, carthage, derived, from, the, phoenician, qart, hadasht, meaning, new, city, the, city, s, wealth, and, prosperity, attracts, both, phoenicians, from, nearby, utica, and, the, indigenous, libyans, whose, king, iarbas, now, seeks, dido, s, hand, in, marriage, threatened, with, war, should, she, refuse, and, also, loyal, to, the, memory, of, her, deceased, husband, the, queen, orders, a, funeral, pyre, to, be, built, where, she, commits, suicide, by, stabbing, herself, with, a, sword, she, is, thereafter, worshiped, as, a, goddess, by, the, people, of, carthage, who, are, described, as, brave, in, battle, but, prone, to, the, cruel, religious, ceremony, of, human, sacrifice, even, of, children, whenever, they, seek, divine, relief, from, troubles, of, any, kind, virgil, s, epic, poem, the, aeneid, written, over, a, century, after, the, third, punic, war, tells, the, mythical, story, of, the, trojan, hero, aeneas, and, his, journey, towards, founding, rome, inextricably, tying, together, the, founding, myths, and, ultimate, fates, of, both, rome, and, carthage, its, introduction, begins, by, mentioning, an, ancient, city, that, many, readers, likely, assumed, was, rome, or, troy, but, goes, on, to, describe, it, as, a, place, held, by, colonists, from, tyre, opposite, italy, a, city, of, great, wealth, and, ruthless, in, the, pursuit, of, war, its, name, was, carthage, and, juno, is, said, to, have, loved, it, more, than, any, other, place, but, she, had, heard, that, there, was, rising, from, the, blood, of, troy, a, race, of, men, who, in, days, to, come, would, overthrow, this, tyrian, citadel, sack, the, land, of, libya, virgil, describes, queen, elissa, for, whom, he, uses, the, ancient, greek, name, dido, meaning, beloved, as, an, esteemed, clever, but, ultimately, tragic, character, as, in, other, legends, the, impetus, for, her, escape, is, her, tyrannical, brother, pygmalion, whose, secret, murder, of, her, husband, is, revealed, to, her, in, a, dream, cleverly, exploiting, her, brother, s, greed, dido, tricks, pygmalion, into, supporting, her, journey, to, find, and, bring, back, riches, for, him, through, this, ruse, she, sets, sail, with, gold, and, allies, secretly, in, search, of, a, new, home, as, in, justin, s, account, upon, landing, in, north, africa, dido, is, greeted, by, iarbas, and, after, he, offers, as, much, land, as, could, be, covered, by, a, single, ox, hide, she, cuts, the, hide, into, very, thin, strips, and, encircles, all, of, byrsa, while, digging, to, set, the, foundation, of, their, new, settlement, the, tyrians, discover, the, head, of, a, horse, which, in, phoenician, culture, is, a, symbol, of, courage, and, conquest, the, horse, foretells, where, dido, s, new, city, will, rise, becoming, the, emblem, of, the, new, city, carthage, in, just, seven, years, since, their, exodus, from, tyre, the, carthaginians, build, a, successful, kingdom, under, dido, s, rule, she, is, adored, by, her, subjects, and, presented, with, a, festival, of, praise, virgil, portrays, her, character, as, even, more, noble, when, she, offers, asylum, to, aeneas, and, his, men, who, had, recently, escaped, from, troy, the, two, fall, in, love, during, a, hunting, expedition, and, dido, comes, to, believe, they, will, marry, jupiter, sends, a, spirit, in, the, form, of, the, messenger, god, mercury, to, remind, aeneas, that, his, mission, is, not, to, stay, in, carthage, with, his, new, found, love, dido, but, to, sail, to, italy, to, found, rome, the, trojan, departs, leaving, dido, so, heartbroken, that, she, commits, suicide, by, stabbing, herself, upon, a, funeral, pyre, with, his, sword, as, she, lies, dying, she, predicts, eternal, strife, between, aeneas, people, and, her, own, proclaiming, rise, up, from, my, bones, avenging, spirit, in, an, invocation, of, hannibal, aeneas, sees, the, smoke, from, the, pyre, as, he, sails, away, and, though, he, does, not, know, the, fate, of, dido, he, identifies, it, as, a, bad, omen, ultimately, his, descendants, go, on, to, found, the, roman, kingdom, the, predecessor, of, the, roman, empire, like, justin, virgil, s, story, essentially, conveys, rome, s, attitude, towards, carthage, as, exemplified, by, cato, the, elder, s, famous, utterance, carthago, delenda, est, carthage, must, be, destroyed, in, essence, rome, and, carthage, were, fated, for, conflict, aeneas, chose, rome, over, dido, eliciting, her, dying, curse, upon, his, roman, descendants, and, thus, providing, a, mythical, fatalistic, backdrop, for, a, century, of, bitter, conflict, between, rome, and, carthage, these, stories, typify, the, roman, attitude, towards, carthage, a, level, of, grudging, respect, and, acknowledgement, of, their, bravery, prosperity, and, even, their, city, s, seniority, to, rome, along, with, derision, of, their, cruelty, deviousness, and, decadence, as, exemplified, by, their, practice, of, human, sacrifice, to, facilitate, their, commercial, ventures, the, phoenicians, established, numerous, colonies, and, trading, posts, along, the, coasts, of, the, mediterranean, organized, in, fiercely, independent, city, states, the, phoenicians, lacked, the, numbers, or, even, the, desire, to, expand, overseas, most, colonies, had, fewer, than, 1, 000, inhabitants, and, only, a, few, including, carthage, would, grow, larger, motives, for, colonization, were, usually, practical, such, as, seeking, safe, harbors, for, their, merchant, fleets, maintaining, a, monopoly, on, an, area, s, natural, resources, satisfying, the, demand, for, trade, goods, and, finding, areas, where, they, could, trade, freely, without, outside, interference, over, time, many, phoenicians, also, sought, to, escape, their, tributary, obligations, to, foreign, powers, that, had, subjugated, the, phoenician, homeland, another, motivating, factor, was, competition, with, the, greeks, who, became, a, nascent, maritime, power, and, began, establishing, colonies, across, the, mediterranean, and, the, black, sea, the, first, phoenician, colonies, in, the, western, mediterranean, grew, up, on, the, two, paths, to, iberia, s, mineral, wealth, along, the, northwest, african, coast, and, on, sicily, sardinia, and, the, balearic, islands, as, the, largest, and, wealthiest, city, state, among, the, phoenicians, tyre, led, the, way, in, settling, or, controlling, coastal, areas, strabo, claims, that, the, tyrians, alone, founded, three, hundred, colonies, on, the, west, african, coast, though, clearly, an, exaggeration, many, colonies, did, arise, in, tunisia, morocco, algeria, iberia, and, in, libya, they, were, usually, established, as, trading, stations, at, intervals, of, about, 30, to, 50, kilometres, along, the, african, coast, by, the, time, they, gained, a, foothold, in, africa, the, phoenicians, were, already, present, in, cyprus, crete, corsica, the, balearic, islands, sardinia, and, sicily, as, well, as, on, the, european, mainland, in, what, are, today, genoa, and, marseilles, foreshadowing, the, later, sicilian, wars, settlements, in, crete, and, sicily, continually, clashed, with, the, greeks, and, phoenician, control, over, all, of, sicily, was, brief, nearly, all, these, areas, would, come, under, the, leadership, and, protection, of, carthage, which, eventually, founded, cities, of, its, own, especially, after, the, decline, of, tyre, and, sidon, the, site, of, carthage, was, likely, chosen, by, the, tyrians, for, several, reasons, it, was, located, in, the, central, shore, of, the, gulf, of, tunis, which, gave, it, access, to, the, mediterranean, sea, while, shielding, it, from, the, region, s, infamously, violent, storms, it, was, also, close, to, the, strategically, vital, strait, of, sicily, a, key, bottleneck, for, maritime, trade, between, the, east, and, west, the, terrain, proved, as, invaluable, as, the, geography, the, city, was, built, on, a, hilly, triangular, peninsula, backed, by, the, lake, of, tunis, which, provided, abundant, supplies, of, fish, and, a, place, for, safe, harbor, the, peninsula, was, connected, to, the, mainland, by, a, narrow, strip, of, land, which, combined, with, the, rough, surrounding, terrain, made, the, city, easily, defensible, a, citadel, was, built, on, byrsa, a, low, hill, overlooking, the, sea, finally, carthage, would, be, conduit, of, two, major, trade, routes, one, between, the, tyrian, colony, of, cadiz, in, southern, spain, which, supplied, raw, materials, for, manufacturing, in, tyre, and, the, other, between, north, africa, and, the, northern, mediterranean, namely, sicily, italy, and, greece, in, contrast, to, most, phoenician, colonies, carthage, grew, larger, and, more, quickly, thanks, to, its, combination, of, favorable, climate, arable, land, and, lucrative, trade, routes, within, just, one, century, of, its, founding, its, population, rose, to, 30, 000, meanwhile, its, mother, city, which, for, centuries, was, the, preeminent, economic, and, political, center, of, phoenician, civilization, saw, its, status, begin, to, wane, in, the, seventh, century, bc, following, a, succession, of, sieges, by, the, babylonians, by, this, time, its, carthaginian, colony, had, become, immensely, wealthy, from, its, strategic, location, and, extensive, trade, network, unlike, many, other, phoenician, city, states, and, dependencies, carthage, grew, prosperous, not, only, from, maritime, commerce, but, from, its, proximity, to, fertile, agricultural, land, and, rich, mineral, deposits, as, the, main, hub, for, trade, between, africa, and, the, rest, of, the, ancient, world, it, also, provided, a, myriad, of, rare, and, luxurious, goods, including, terracotta, figurines, and, masks, jewelry, delicately, carved, ivories, ostrich, eggs, and, a, variety, of, foods, and, wine, carthage, s, growing, economic, prominence, coincided, with, a, nascent, national, identity, although, carthaginians, remained, staunchly, phoenician, in, their, customs, and, faith, by, at, least, the, seventh, century, bc, they, had, developed, a, distinct, punic, culture, infused, with, local, influences, certain, deities, became, more, prominent, in, the, carthaginian, pantheon, than, in, phoenicia, into, the, fifth, century, bc, the, carthaginians, were, worshiping, greek, deities, such, as, demeter, these, trends, most, likely, precipitated, the, colony, s, emergence, as, an, independent, polity, though, the, specific, date, and, circumstances, are, unknown, carthage, became, independent, in, the, middle, of, the, 6th, century, bc, it, had, grown, into, a, fully, independent, thalassocracy, embarking, its, own, colonization, efforts, across, the, western, mediterranean, it, nonetheless, maintained, amicable, cultural, political, and, commercial, ties, with, its, founding, city, and, the, phoenician, homeland, it, continued, to, receive, migrants, from, tyre, and, for, a, time, continued, the, practice, of, sending, annual, tribute, to, tyre, s, temple, of, melqart, albeit, at, irregular, intervals, by, the, sixth, century, bc, tyre, s, power, declined, further, still, after, its, voluntary, submission, to, the, persian, king, cambyses, r, 530, 522, bc, which, resulted, in, the, incorporation, of, the, phoenician, homeland, into, the, persian, empire, lacking, sufficient, naval, strength, cambyses, sought, tyrian, assistance, for, his, planned, conquest, of, carthage, which, may, indicate, that, the, former, tyrian, colony, had, become, wealthy, enough, to, warrant, a, long, and, difficult, expedition, herodotus, claims, that, the, tyrians, refused, to, cooperate, due, to, their, affinity, for, carthage, causing, the, persian, king, to, abort, his, campaign, though, it, escaped, reprisal, tyre, s, status, as, phoenicia, s, leading, city, was, significantly, circumscribed, its, rival, sidon, subsequently, garnered, more, support, from, the, persians, however, it, too, remained, subjugated, leading, the, way, for, carthage, to, fill, the, vacuum, as, the, leading, phoenician, political, power, although, the, carthaginians, retained, the, traditional, phoenician, affinity, for, maritime, trade, and, commerce, they, were, distinguished, by, their, imperial, and, military, ambitions, whereas, the, phoenician, city, states, rarely, engaged, in, territorial, conquest, carthage, became, an, expansionist, power, driven, by, its, desire, to, access, new, sources, of, wealth, and, trade, it, is, unknown, what, factors, influenced, the, citizens, of, carthage, unlike, those, of, other, phoenician, colonies, to, create, an, economic, and, political, hegemony, the, nearby, city, of, utica, was, far, older, and, enjoyed, the, same, geographical, and, political, advantages, but, never, embarked, on, hegemonic, conquest, instead, coming, under, carthaginian, influence, one, theory, is, that, babylonian, and, persian, domination, of, the, phoenician, homeland, produced, refugees, that, swelled, carthage, s, population, and, transferred, the, culture, wealth, and, traditions, of, tyre, to, carthage, the, threat, to, the, phoenician, trade, monopoly, by, etruscan, and, greek, competition, in, the, west, and, through, foreign, subjugation, of, its, homeland, in, the, east, also, created, the, conditions, for, carthage, to, consolidate, its, power, and, further, its, commercial, interests, another, contributing, factor, may, have, been, domestic, politics, while, little, is, known, of, carthage, s, government, and, leadership, prior, to, the, third, century, bc, the, reign, of, mago, i, c, 550, 530, and, the, political, dominance, of, the, magonid, family, in, subsequent, decades, precipitated, carthage, s, rise, as, a, dominant, power, justin, states, that, mago, who, was, also, general, of, the, army, was, the, first, carthaginian, leader, to, in, order, the, military, system, which, may, have, entailed, the, introduction, of, new, military, strategies, and, technologies, he, is, also, credited, with, initiating, or, at, least, expanding, the, practice, of, recruiting, subject, peoples, and, mercenaries, as, carthage, s, population, was, too, small, to, secure, and, defend, its, scattered, colonies, libyans, iberians, sardinians, and, corsicans, were, soon, enlisted, for, the, magonid, expansionist, campaigns, across, the, region, by, the, beginning, of, the, fourth, century, bc, the, carthaginians, had, become, the, superior, power, of, the, western, mediterranean, and, would, remain, so, for, roughly, the, next, three, centuries, carthage, took, control, of, all, nearby, phoenician, colonies, including, hadrumetum, utica, hippo, diarrhytus, and, kerkouane, subjugated, many, neighboring, libyan, tribes, and, occupied, coastal, north, africa, from, morocco, to, western, libya, it, held, sardinia, malta, the, balearic, islands, and, the, western, half, of, sicily, where, coastal, fortresses, such, as, motya, and, lilybaeum, secured, their, possessions, the, iberian, peninsula, which, was, rich, in, precious, metals, saw, some, of, the, largest, and, most, important, carthaginian, settlements, outside, north, africa, though, the, degree, of, political, influence, before, the, conquest, by, hamilcar, barca, 237, 228, bc, is, disputed, carthage, s, growing, wealth, and, power, along, with, the, foreign, subjugation, of, the, phoenician, homeland, led, to, its, supplanting, of, sidon, as, the, supreme, phoenician, city, state, carthage, s, empire, was, largely, informal, and, multifaceted, consisting, of, varying, levels, of, control, exercised, in, equally, variable, ways, it, established, new, colonies, repopulated, and, reinforced, older, ones, formed, defensive, pacts, with, other, phoenician, city, states, and, acquired, territories, directly, by, conquest, while, some, phoenician, colonies, willingly, submitted, to, carthage, paying, tribute, and, giving, up, their, foreign, policy, others, in, iberia, and, sardinia, resisted, carthaginian, efforts, whereas, other, phoenician, cities, never, exercised, actual, control, of, the, colonies, the, carthaginians, appointed, magistrates, to, directly, control, their, own, a, policy, that, would, lead, to, a, number, of, iberian, towns, siding, with, the, romans, during, the, punic, wars, in, many, other, instances, carthage, s, hegemony, was, established, through, treaties, alliances, tributary, obligations, and, other, such, arrangements, it, had, elements, of, the, delian, league, led, by, athens, allies, shared, funding, and, manpower, for, defense, the, spartan, kingdom, subject, peoples, serving, as, serfs, for, the, punic, elite, and, state, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, roman, republic, allies, contributing, manpower, and, tribute, for, rome, s, war, machine, in, 509, bc, carthage, and, rome, signed, the, first, of, several, treaties, demarcating, their, respective, influence, and, commercial, activities, this, is, the, first, textual, source, demonstrating, carthaginian, control, over, sicily, and, sardinia, the, treaty, also, conveys, the, extent, to, which, carthage, was, at, the, very, least, on, equal, terms, with, rome, whose, influence, was, limited, to, parts, of, central, and, southern, italy, carthaginian, dominance, of, the, sea, reflected, not, only, its, phoenician, heritage, but, an, approach, to, empire, building, that, differed, greatly, from, rome, carthage, emphasized, maritime, trade, over, territorial, expansion, and, accordingly, focused, its, settlements, and, influence, on, coastal, areas, while, investing, more, on, its, navy, for, similar, reasons, its, ambitions, were, more, commercial, than, imperial, which, is, why, its, empire, took, the, form, of, a, hegemony, based, on, treaties, and, political, arrangements, more, than, conquest, by, contrast, the, romans, focused, on, expanding, and, consolidating, their, control, over, the, rest, of, mainland, italy, and, would, aim, to, extend, its, control, well, beyond, its, homeland, these, differences, would, prove, key, in, the, conduct, and, trajectory, of, the, later, punic, wars, by, the, third, century, bc, carthage, was, the, center, of, a, sprawling, network, of, colonies, and, client, states, it, controlled, more, territory, than, the, roman, republic, and, became, one, of, the, largest, and, most, prosperous, cities, in, the, mediterranean, with, a, quarter, of, a, million, inhabitants, carthage, did, not, focus, on, growing, and, conquering, land, instead, it, was, found, that, carthage, was, focused, on, growing, trade, and, protecting, trade, routes, the, trades, through, libya, were, territories, and, carthage, paid, libyans, for, access, to, this, land, in, cape, bon, for, agricultural, purposes, until, about, 550, bc, in, around, 508, bc, carthage, and, rome, signed, a, treaty, to, keep, their, commercial, planes, separate, from, each, other, carthage, focused, on, growing, their, population, by, taking, in, phoenicians, colonies, and, soon, began, controlling, libyan, african, and, roman, colonies, many, phoenician, cities, also, had, to, pay, or, support, the, carthaginian, troops, punic, troops, would, defend, cities, and, these, cities, had, few, rights, unlike, the, existential, conflict, of, the, later, punic, wars, with, rome, the, conflict, between, carthage, and, the, greeks, centered, on, economic, concerns, as, each, side, sought, to, advance, their, own, commercial, interests, and, influence, by, controlling, key, trade, routes, for, centuries, the, phoenician, and, greek, city, states, had, embarked, on, maritime, trade, and, colonization, across, the, mediterranean, while, the, phoenicians, were, initially, dominant, greek, competition, increasingly, undermined, their, monopoly, both, sides, had, begun, establishing, colonies, trading, posts, and, commercial, relations, in, the, western, mediterranean, roughly, contemporaneously, between, the, ninth, and, eighth, centuries, phoenician, and, greek, settlements, the, increased, presence, of, both, peoples, led, to, mounting, tensions, and, ultimately, open, conflict, especially, in, sicily, carthage, s, economic, successes, buoyed, by, its, vast, maritime, trade, network, led, to, the, development, of, a, powerful, navy, to, protect, and, secure, vital, shipping, lanes, its, hegemony, brought, it, into, increasing, conflict, with, the, greeks, of, syracuse, who, also, sought, control, of, the, central, mediterranean, founded, in, the, mid, seventh, century, bc, syracuse, had, risen, to, become, one, of, the, wealthiest, and, most, powerful, greek, city, states, and, the, preeminent, greek, polity, in, the, region, the, island, of, sicily, lying, at, carthage, s, doorstep, became, the, main, arena, on, which, this, conflict, played, out, from, their, earliest, days, both, the, greeks, and, phoenicians, had, been, attracted, to, the, large, centrally, located, island, each, establishing, a, large, number, of, colonies, and, trading, posts, along, its, coasts, battles, raged, between, these, settlements, for, centuries, with, neither, side, ever, having, total, long, term, control, over, the, island, in, 480, bc, gelo, the, tyrant, of, syracuse, attempted, to, unite, the, island, under, his, rule, with, the, backing, of, other, greek, city, states, threatened, by, the, potential, power, of, a, united, sicily, carthage, intervened, militarily, led, by, king, hamilcar, of, the, magonid, dynasty, traditional, accounts, including, by, herodotus, and, diodorus, number, hamilcar, s, army, at, around, 300, 000, though, likely, exaggerated, it, was, likely, of, formidable, strength, while, sailing, to, sicily, hamilcar, suffered, losses, due, to, poor, weather, landing, at, panormus, modern, day, palermo, he, spent, three, days, reorganizing, his, forces, and, repairing, his, battered, fleet, the, carthaginians, marched, along, the, coast, to, himera, making, camp, before, engaging, in, battle, against, the, forces, of, syracuse, and, its, ally, agrigentum, the, greeks, won, a, decisive, victory, inflicting, heavy, losses, on, the, carthaginians, including, their, leader, hamilcar, who, was, either, killed, during, the, battle, or, committed, suicide, in, shame, as, a, result, the, carthaginian, nobility, sued, for, peace, the, conflict, proved, to, be, a, major, turning, point, for, carthage, though, it, would, retain, some, presence, in, sicily, most, of, the, island, would, remain, in, greek, and, later, roman, hands, the, carthaginians, would, never, again, expand, their, territory, or, sphere, of, influence, on, the, island, to, any, meaningful, degree, instead, turning, their, attention, to, securing, or, increasing, their, hold, in, north, africa, and, iberia, the, death, of, king, hamilcar, and, the, disastrous, conduct, of, the, war, also, prompted, political, reforms, that, established, an, oligarchic, republic, carthage, would, henceforth, constrain, its, rulers, through, assemblies, of, both, nobles, and, the, common, people, by, 410, bc, carthage, had, recovered, from, its, serious, defeats, in, sicily, it, had, conquered, much, of, modern, day, tunisia, and, founded, new, colonies, across, northern, africa, it, also, extended, its, reach, well, beyond, the, mediterranean, hanno, the, navigator, journeyed, down, the, west, african, coast, and, himilco, the, navigator, had, explored, the, european, atlantic, coast, expeditions, were, also, led, into, morocco, and, senegal, as, well, as, the, atlantic, the, same, year, the, iberian, colonies, seceded, cutting, off, carthage, from, a, major, source, of, silver, and, copper, the, loss, of, such, strategically, important, mineral, wealth, combined, with, the, desire, to, exercise, firmer, control, over, shipping, routes, led, hannibal, mago, grandson, of, hamilcar, to, make, preparations, to, reclaim, sicily, in, 409, bc, hannibal, mago, set, out, for, sicily, with, his, force, he, captured, the, smaller, cities, of, selinus, modern, selinunte, and, himera, where, the, carthaginians, had, been, dealt, a, humiliating, defeat, seventy, years, prior, before, returning, triumphantly, to, carthage, with, the, spoils, of, war, but, the, primary, enemy, syracuse, remained, untouched, and, in, 405, bc, hannibal, mago, led, a, second, carthaginian, expedition, to, claim, the, rest, of, the, island, this, time, however, he, met, with, fiercer, resistance, as, well, as, misfortune, during, the, siege, of, agrigentum, carthaginian, forces, were, ravaged, by, plague, which, claimed, hannibal, mago, himself, his, successor, himilco, managed, to, extend, the, campaign, capturing, the, city, of, gela, and, repeatedly, defeating, the, army, of, dionysius, of, syracuse, but, he, too, was, struck, with, plague, and, forced, to, sue, for, peace, before, returning, to, carthage, by, 398, bc, dionysius, had, regained, his, strength, and, broke, the, peace, treaty, striking, at, the, carthaginian, stronghold, of, motya, in, western, sicily, himilco, responded, decisively, leading, an, expedition, that, not, only, reclaimed, motya, but, also, captured, messene, present, day, messina, within, a, year, the, carthaginians, were, besieging, syracuse, itself, and, came, close, to, victory, until, the, plague, once, again, ravaged, and, reduced, their, forces, the, fighting, in, sicily, swung, in, favor, of, carthage, less, than, a, decade, later, in, 387, bc, after, winning, a, naval, battle, off, the, coast, of, catania, himilco, laid, siege, to, syracuse, with, 50, 000, carthaginians, but, yet, another, epidemic, struck, down, thousands, of, them, with, the, enemy, assault, stalled, and, weakened, dionysius, then, launched, a, surprise, counterattack, by, land, and, sea, destroying, all, the, carthaginian, ships, while, its, crews, were, ashore, at, the, same, time, his, ground, forces, stormed, the, besiegers, lines, and, routed, them, himilco, and, his, chief, officers, abandoned, their, army, and, fled, sicily, once, again, the, carthaginians, were, forced, to, press, for, peace, returning, to, carthage, in, disgrace, himilco, was, met, with, contempt, and, committed, suicide, by, starving, himself, notwithstanding, consistently, poor, luck, and, costly, reversals, sicily, remained, an, obsession, for, carthage, over, the, next, fifty, years, an, uneasy, peace, reigned, as, carthaginian, and, greek, forces, engaged, in, constant, skirmishes, by, 340, bc, carthage, had, been, pushed, entirely, into, the, southwest, corner, of, the, island, in, 315, bc, carthage, found, itself, on, the, defensive, in, sicily, as, agathocles, of, syracuse, broke, the, terms, of, the, peace, treaty, and, sought, to, dominate, the, entire, island, within, four, years, he, seized, messene, laid, siege, to, agrigentum, and, invaded, the, last, carthaginian, holdings, on, the, island, hamilcar, grandson, of, hanno, the, great, led, the, carthaginian, response, with, great, success, because, of, carthage, s, power, over, the, trade, routes, carthage, had, a, rich, and, strong, navy, that, was, able, to, lead, within, a, year, of, their, arrival, the, carthaginians, controlled, almost, all, of, sicily, and, were, besieging, syracuse, in, desperation, agathocles, secretly, led, an, expedition, of, 14, 000, men, to, attack, carthage, forcing, hamilcar, and, most, of, his, army, to, return, home, although, agathocles, forces, were, eventually, defeated, in, 307, bc, he, managed, to, escape, back, to, sicily, and, negotiate, peace, thus, maintaining, the, status, quo, and, syracuse, as, a, stronghold, of, greek, power, in, sicily, carthage, was, once, again, drawn, into, a, war, in, sicily, this, time, by, pyrrhus, of, epirus, who, challenged, both, roman, and, carthaginian, supremacy, over, the, mediterranean, the, greek, city, of, tarentum, in, southern, italy, had, come, into, conflict, with, an, expansionist, rome, and, sought, the, aid, of, pyrrhus, seeing, an, opportunity, to, forge, a, new, empire, pyrrhus, sent, an, advance, guard, of, 3, 000, infantry, to, tarentum, under, the, command, of, his, adviser, cineaus, meanwhile, he, marched, the, main, army, across, the, greek, peninsula, and, won, several, victories, over, the, thessalians, and, athenians, after, securing, the, greek, mainland, pyrrhus, rejoined, his, advance, guard, in, tarentum, to, conquer, southern, italy, winning, a, decisive, but, costly, victory, at, asculum, according, to, justin, the, carthaginians, worried, that, pyrrhus, might, get, involved, in, sicily, polybius, confirms, the, existence, of, a, mutual, defense, pact, between, carthage, and, rome, ratified, shortly, after, the, battle, of, asculum, these, concerns, proved, prescient, during, the, italian, campaign, pyrrhus, received, envoys, from, the, sicilian, greek, cities, of, agrigentum, leontini, and, syracuse, which, offered, to, submit, to, his, rule, if, he, aided, their, efforts, to, eject, the, carthaginians, from, sicily, having, lost, too, many, men, in, his, conquest, of, asculum, pyrrhus, determined, that, a, war, with, rome, could, not, be, sustained, making, sicily, a, more, enticing, prospect, he, thus, responded, to, the, plea, with, reinforcements, consisting, of, 20, 000, 30, 000, infantry, 1, 500, 3, 000, cavalry, and, 20, war, elephants, supported, by, some, 200, ships, the, ensuing, sicilian, campaign, lasted, three, years, during, which, the, carthaginians, suffered, several, losses, and, reversals, pyrrhus, overcame, the, carthaginian, garrison, at, heraclea, minoa, and, seized, azones, which, prompted, cities, nominally, allied, to, carthage, such, as, selinus, halicyae, and, segesta, to, join, his, side, the, carthaginian, stronghold, of, eryx, which, had, strong, natural, defenses, and, a, large, garrison, held, out, for, a, long, period, of, time, but, was, eventually, taken, iaetia, surrendered, without, a, fight, while, panormus, which, had, the, best, harbour, in, sicily, succumbed, to, a, siege, the, carthaginians, were, pushed, back, to, the, westernmost, portion, of, the, island, holding, only, lilybaeum, which, was, put, under, siege, following, these, losses, carthage, sued, for, peace, offering, large, sums, of, money, and, even, ships, but, pyrrhus, refused, unless, carthage, renounced, its, claims, to, sicily, entirely, the, siege, of, lilybaeum, continued, with, the, carthaginians, successfully, holding, out, due, to, the, size, of, their, forces, their, large, quantities, of, siege, weapons, and, the, rocky, terrain, as, pyrrhus, losses, were, mounting, he, set, out, to, build, more, powerful, war, engines, however, after, two, more, months, of, dogged, resistance, he, abandoned, the, siege, plutarch, claimed, that, the, ambitious, king, of, epirus, now, had, his, sights, on, carthage, itself, and, began, outfitting, an, expedition, in, preparation, for, his, invasion, he, treated, the, sicilian, greeks, more, ruthlessly, even, executing, two, of, their, rulers, on, false, charges, of, treason, the, subsequent, animosity, among, the, greeks, of, sicily, drove, some, to, join, forces, with, the, carthaginians, who, took, up, the, war, vigorously, upon, noticing, pyrrhus, dwindling, support, cassius, dio, claimed, that, carthage, had, harboured, the, exiled, syracusans, and, harassed, so, severely, that, he, abandoned, not, only, syracuse, but, sicily, as, well, a, renewed, roman, offensive, also, forced, him, to, focus, his, attention, on, southern, italy, according, to, both, plutarch, and, appian, while, pyrrhus, army, was, being, transported, by, ship, to, mainland, italy, the, carthaginian, navy, inflicted, a, devastating, blow, in, the, battle, of, the, strait, of, messina, sinking, or, disabling, 98, out, of, 110, ships, carthage, sent, additional, forces, to, sicily, and, following, pyrrhus, departure, managed, to, regain, control, of, their, domains, on, the, island, pyrrhus, campaigns, in, italy, ultimately, proved, inconclusive, and, he, eventually, withdrew, to, epirus, for, the, carthaginians, the, war, meant, a, return, to, the, status, quo, as, they, once, again, held, the, western, and, central, regions, of, sicily, for, the, romans, however, much, of, magna, graecia, gradually, fell, under, their, sphere, of, influence, bringing, them, closer, to, complete, domination, of, the, italian, peninsula, rome, s, success, against, pyrrhus, solidified, its, status, as, a, rising, power, which, paved, the, way, for, conflict, with, carthage, in, what, is, likely, an, apocryphal, account, pyrrhus, upon, departing, from, sicily, told, his, companions, what, a, wrestling, ground, we, are, leaving, my, friends, for, the, carthaginians, and, the, romans, when, agathocles, of, syracuse, died, in, 288, bc, a, large, company, of, italian, mercenaries, previously, in, his, service, found, themselves, suddenly, unemployed, naming, themselves, mamertines, sons, of, mars, they, seized, the, city, of, messana, and, became, a, law, unto, themselves, terrorizing, the, surrounding, countryside, the, mamertines, became, a, growing, threat, to, carthage, and, syracuse, alike, in, 265, bc, hiero, ii, of, syracuse, former, general, of, pyrrhus, took, action, against, them, faced, with, a, vastly, superior, force, the, mamertines, divided, into, two, factions, one, advocating, surrender, to, carthage, the, other, preferring, to, seek, aid, from, rome, while, the, roman, senate, debated, the, best, course, of, action, the, carthaginians, eagerly, agreed, to, send, a, garrison, to, messana, carthaginian, forces, were, admitted, to, the, city, and, a, carthaginian, fleet, sailed, into, the, messanan, harbor, however, soon, afterwards, they, began, negotiating, with, hiero, alarmed, the, mamertines, sent, another, embassy, to, rome, asking, them, to, expel, the, carthaginians, hiero, s, intervention, placed, carthage, s, military, forces, directly, across, the, strait, of, messina, the, narrow, channel, of, water, that, separated, sicily, from, italy, moreover, the, presence, of, the, carthaginian, fleet, gave, them, effective, control, over, this, strategically, important, bottleneck, and, demonstrated, a, clear, and, present, danger, to, nearby, rome, and, her, interests, as, a, result, the, roman, assembly, although, reluctant, to, ally, with, a, band, of, mercenaries, sent, an, expeditionary, force, to, return, control, of, messana, to, the, mamertines, the, subsequent, roman, attack, on, carthaginian, forces, at, messana, triggered, the, first, of, the, punic, wars, over, the, course, of, the, next, century, these, three, major, conflicts, between, rome, and, carthage, would, determine, the, course, of, western, civilization, the, wars, included, a, dramatic, carthaginian, invasion, led, by, hannibal, which, nearly, brought, an, end, to, rome, during, the, first, punic, wars, the, romans, under, the, command, of, marcus, atilius, regulus, managed, to, land, in, africa, though, were, ultimately, repelled, by, the, carthaginians, notwithstanding, the, decisive, defense, of, its, homeland, as, well, as, some, initial, naval, victories, carthage, suffered, a, succession, of, losses, that, forced, it, to, sue, for, peace, shortly, thereafter, carthage, also, faced, a, major, mercenary, revolt, that, dramatically, changed, its, internal, political, landscape, bringing, the, influential, barcid, family, to, prominence, the, war, also, impacted, carthage, s, international, standing, as, rome, used, the, events, of, the, war, to, back, its, claim, over, sardinia, and, corsica, which, it, promptly, seized, the, mercenary, war, also, known, as, the, truceless, war, was, a, mutiny, by, troops, that, were, employed, by, carthage, at, the, end, of, the, first, punic, war, 264, 241, bc, supported, by, uprisings, of, african, settlements, revolting, against, carthaginian, control, it, lasted, from, 241, to, late, 238, or, early, 237, bc, and, ended, with, carthage, suppressing, both, the, mutiny, and, the, revolt, lingering, mutual, animosity, and, renewed, tensions, along, their, borderlands, led, to, the, second, punic, war, 218, 201, bc, which, involved, factions, from, across, the, western, and, eastern, mediterranean, the, war, is, marked, by, hannibal, s, surprising, overland, journey, to, rome, particularly, his, costly, and, strategically, bold, crossing, of, the, alps, his, entrance, into, northern, italy, was, followed, by, his, reinforcement, by, gaulish, allies, and, crushing, victories, over, roman, armies, in, the, battle, of, the, trebia, and, the, giant, ambush, at, trasimene, against, his, skill, on, the, battlefield, the, romans, employed, the, fabian, strategy, which, resorted, to, skirmishes, in, lieu, of, direct, engagement, with, the, aim, of, delaying, and, gradually, weakening, his, forces, while, effective, this, approach, was, politically, unpopular, as, it, ran, contrary, to, traditional, military, strategy, the, romans, thus, resorted, to, another, major, field, battle, at, cannae, but, despite, their, superior, numbers, suffered, a, crushing, defeat, with, an, estimated, 60, 000, casualties, consequently, many, roman, allies, went, over, to, carthage, prolonging, the, war, in, italy, for, over, a, decade, during, which, more, roman, armies, were, nearly, consistently, destroyed, on, the, battlefield, despite, these, setbacks, the, romans, had, the, manpower, to, absorb, such, losses, and, replenish, their, ranks, along, with, their, superior, capability, in, siegecraft, they, were, able, to, recapture, all, the, major, cities, that, had, joined, the, enemy, as, well, as, defeat, a, carthaginian, attempt, to, reinforce, hannibal, at, the, battle, of, the, metaurus, meanwhile, in, iberia, which, served, as, the, main, source, of, manpower, for, the, carthaginian, army, a, second, roman, expedition, under, scipio, africanus, took, new, carthage, and, ended, carthaginian, rule, over, the, peninsula, in, the, battle, of, ilipa, the, final, showdown, was, the, battle, of, zama, which, took, place, in, the, carthaginian, heartland, of, tunisia, after, trouncing, carthaginian, forces, at, the, battles, of, utica, and, the, great, plains, scipio, africanus, forced, hannibal, to, abandon, his, increasingly, stalled, campaign, in, italy, despite, the, latter, s, superior, numbers, and, innovative, tactics, the, carthaginians, suffered, a, crushing, and, decisive, defeat, after, years, of, costly, fighting, that, brought, them, to, the, verge, of, destruction, the, romans, imposed, harsh, and, retributive, peace, conditions, on, carthage, in, addition, to, a, large, financial, indemnity, the, carthaginians, were, stripped, of, their, once, proud, navy, and, reduced, only, to, their, north, african, territory, in, effect, carthage, became, a, roman, client, state, the, third, and, final, punic, war, began, in, 149, bc, largely, due, to, the, efforts, of, hawkish, roman, senators, led, by, cato, the, elder, to, finish, carthage, off, once, and, for, all, cato, was, known, for, finishing, nearly, every, speech, in, the, senate, regardless, of, the, subject, with, the, phrase, ceterum, censeo, carthaginem, esse, delendam, moreover, i, am, of, the, opinion, that, carthage, ought, to, be, destroyed, in, particular, the, growing, roman, republic, sought, the, famously, rich, agricultural, lands, of, carthage, and, its, african, territories, which, had, been, known, to, the, romans, following, their, invasion, in, the, previous, punic, war, carthage, s, border, war, with, rome, s, ally, numidia, though, initiated, by, the, latter, nonetheless, provided, the, pretext, for, rome, to, declare, war, the, third, punic, war, was, a, much, smaller, and, shorter, engagement, than, its, predecessors, primarily, consisting, of, a, single, main, action, the, battle, of, carthage, however, despite, their, significantly, reduced, size, military, and, wealth, the, carthaginians, managed, to, mount, a, surprisingly, strong, initial, defense, the, roman, invasion, was, soon, stalled, by, defeats, at, lake, tunis, nepheris, and, hippagreta, even, the, diminished, carthaginian, navy, managed, to, inflict, severe, losses, on, a, roman, fleet, through, the, use, of, fire, ships, carthage, itself, managed, to, resist, the, roman, siege, for, three, years, until, scipio, aemilianus, the, adopted, grandson, of, scipio, africanus, was, appointed, consul, and, took, command, of, the, assault, notwithstanding, its, impressive, resistance, carthage, s, defeat, was, ultimately, a, foregone, conclusion, given, the, far, larger, size, and, strength, of, the, roman, republic, though, it, was, the, smallest, of, the, punic, wars, the, third, war, was, to, be, the, most, decisive, the, complete, destruction, of, the, city, of, carthage, the, annexation, of, all, remaining, carthaginian, territory, by, rome, and, the, death, or, enslavement, of, tens, of, thousands, of, carthaginians, the, war, ended, carthage, s, independent, existence, and, consequently, eliminated, the, last, phoenician, political, power, following, carthage, s, destruction, rome, established, africa, proconsularis, its, first, province, in, africa, which, roughly, corresponded, to, carthaginian, territory, utica, which, had, allied, itself, with, rome, during, the, final, war, was, granted, tax, privileges, and, made, the, regional, capital, subsequently, becoming, the, leading, center, of, punic, trade, and, culture, in, 122, bc, gaius, gracchus, a, populist, roman, senator, founded, the, short, lived, colony, of, colonia, iunonia, after, the, latin, name, for, the, punic, goddess, tanit, iuno, caelestis, located, near, the, site, of, carthage, its, purpose, was, to, provide, arable, land, for, impoverished, farmers, but, it, was, soon, abolished, by, the, roman, senate, to, undermine, gracchus, power, nearly, a, century, after, the, fall, of, carthage, a, new, roman, carthage, was, built, on, the, same, site, by, julius, caesar, between, 49, and, 44, bc, it, soon, became, the, center, of, the, province, of, africa, which, was, a, major, breadbasket, of, the, roman, empire, and, one, of, its, wealthiest, provinces, by, the, first, century, carthago, had, grown, to, be, the, second, largest, city, in, the, western, roman, empire, with, a, peak, population, of, 500, 000, punic, language, identity, and, culture, persisted, in, rome, for, several, centuries, two, roman, emperors, in, the, third, century, septimius, severus, and, his, son, and, successor, caracalla, were, of, punic, descent, in, the, fourth, century, augustine, of, hippo, himself, of, berber, heritage, noted, that, punic, was, still, spoken, in, the, region, by, people, who, identified, as, kn, nm, or, chanani, as, the, carthaginians, had, called, themselves, settlements, across, north, africa, sardinia, and, sicily, continued, to, speak, and, write, punic, as, evidenced, by, inscriptions, on, temples, tombs, public, monuments, and, artwork, dating, well, after, the, roman, conquest, punic, names, were, still, used, until, at, least, the, fourth, century, even, by, prominent, denizens, of, roman, africa, and, some, local, officials, in, formerly, punic, territories, used, the, title, some, punic, ideas, and, innovations, survived, roman, conquest, and, even, became, mainstream, in, roman, culture, mago, s, manual, on, farming, and, estate, management, was, among, the, few, carthaginian, texts, to, be, spared, from, destruction, and, was, even, translated, into, greek, and, latin, by, order, of, the, senate, latin, vernacular, had, several, references, to, punic, culture, including, mala, punica, punic, apples, for, pomegranates, pavimentum, punicum, to, describe, the, use, of, patterned, terracotta, pieces, in, mosaics, and, plostellum, punicum, for, the, threshing, board, which, had, been, introduced, to, the, romans, by, carthage, reflecting, the, enduring, hostility, towards, carthage, the, phrase, p, nica, fid, s, or, punic, faith, was, commonly, used, to, describe, acts, of, dishonesty, perfidy, and, treachery, before, the, fourth, century, carthage, was, most, likely, a, monarchy, although, modern, scholars, debate, whether, greek, writers, mislabeled, political, leaders, as, kings, based, on, a, misunderstanding, or, ignorance, of, the, city, s, constitutional, arrangements, traditionally, most, phoenician, kings, did, not, exercise, absolute, power, but, consulted, with, a, body, of, advisors, called, the, adirim, mighty, ones, which, was, likely, composed, of, the, wealthiest, members, of, society, namely, merchants, carthage, seems, to, have, been, ruled, by, a, similar, body, known, as, the, blm, made, up, of, nobles, responsible, for, all, important, matters, of, state, including, religion, administration, and, the, military, this, cabal, included, a, hierarchy, topped, by, the, dominant, family, usually, the, wealthiest, members, of, the, merchant, class, which, had, some, sort, of, executive, power, records, indicate, that, different, families, held, power, at, different, times, suggesting, a, non, hereditary, system, of, government, dependent, on, the, support, or, approval, of, the, consultative, body, carthage, s, political, system, changed, dramatically, after, 480, bc, with, the, death, of, king, hamilcar, i, following, his, disastrous, foray, into, the, first, sicilian, war, the, subsequent, political, upheaval, led, to, a, gradual, weakening, of, the, monarchy, by, at, least, 308, bc, carthage, was, an, oligarchic, republic, characterized, by, an, intricate, system, of, checks, and, balances, a, complex, administrative, system, civil, society, and, a, fairly, high, degree, of, public, accountability, and, participation, the, most, detailed, information, about, the, carthaginian, government, after, this, point, comes, from, the, greek, philosopher, aristotle, whose, fourth, century, bc, treatise, politics, discusses, carthage, as, its, only, non, greek, example, at, the, head, of, the, carthaginian, state, were, two, sufetes, or, judges, who, held, judicial, and, executive, power, while, sometimes, referred, to, as, kings, by, at, least, the, late, fifth, century, bc, the, sufetes, were, non, hereditary, officials, elected, annually, from, among, the, wealthiest, and, most, influential, families, it, is, unknown, how, elections, took, place, or, who, was, eligible, to, serve, livy, likens, the, sufetes, to, roman, consuls, in, that, they, ruled, through, collegiality, and, handled, various, routine, matters, of, state, such, as, convening, and, presiding, over, the, adirim, supreme, council, submitting, business, to, the, popular, assembly, and, adjudicating, trials, modern, scholarly, consensus, agrees, with, livy, s, description, of, sufetes, though, some, have, argued, the, sufetes, held, an, executive, office, closer, to, that, of, modern, presidents, in, parliamentary, republics, in, that, they, did, not, hold, absolute, power, and, exercised, largely, ceremonial, functions, this, practice, may, have, originated, from, plutocratic, arrangements, that, limited, the, suffetes, power, in, earlier, phoenician, cities, for, example, by, the, sixth, century, bc, tyre, was, a, republic, headed, by, elective, magistrates, with, two, suffetes, chosen, from, among, the, most, powerful, noble, families, for, short, terms, unique, among, rulers, in, antiquity, the, suffetes, had, no, power, over, the, military, from, at, least, the, sixth, century, bc, generals, rb, mhnt, or, rab, mahanet, became, separate, political, officials, either, appointed, by, the, administration, or, elected, by, citizens, in, contrast, to, rome, and, greece, military, and, political, power, were, separate, and, it, was, rare, for, an, individual, to, simultaneously, serve, as, general, and, suffete, generals, did, not, serve, fixed, terms, but, instead, served, for, the, duration, of, a, war, however, a, family, that, dominated, the, suffetes, could, install, relatives, or, allies, to, the, generalship, as, occurred, with, the, barcid, dynasty, most, political, power, rested, in, a, council, of, elders, variably, called, the, supreme, council, or, adirim, which, classical, writers, likened, to, the, roman, senate, or, spartan, gerousia, the, adirim, perhaps, numbered, thirty, members, and, had, a, broad, range, of, powers, such, as, administering, the, treasury, and, conducting, foreign, affairs, during, the, second, punic, war, it, reportedly, exercised, some, military, power, like, the, sufetes, council, members, were, elected, from, the, wealthiest, elements, of, carthaginian, society, important, matters, of, state, required, unanimous, agreement, of, the, sufetes, and, of, council, members, according, to, aristotle, carthage, s, highest, constitutional, authority, was, a, judicial, tribunal, known, as, the, one, hundred, and, four, or, miat, although, he, compares, this, body, to, the, ephors, of, sparta, a, council, of, elders, that, held, considerable, political, power, its, primary, function, was, overseeing, the, actions, of, generals, and, other, officials, to, ensure, they, served, the, best, interests, of, the, republic, the, one, hundred, and, four, had, the, power, to, impose, fines, and, even, crucifixion, as, punishment, it, also, formed, panels, of, special, commissioners, called, pentarchies, to, deal, with, various, political, matters, numerous, junior, officials, and, special, commissioners, had, responsibilities, over, different, aspects, of, government, such, as, public, works, tax, collection, and, the, administration, of, the, state, treasury, although, oligarchs, exercised, firm, control, over, carthage, the, government, included, some, democratic, elements, including, trade, unions, town, meetings, and, a, popular, assembly, unlike, in, the, greek, states, of, sparta, and, crete, if, the, suffetes, and, the, supreme, council, could, not, come, to, an, agreement, an, assembly, of, the, people, had, the, deciding, vote, it, is, unclear, whether, this, assembly, was, an, ad, hoc, or, formal, institution, but, aristotle, claims, that, the, voice, of, the, people, was, predominant, in, the, deliberations, and, that, the, people, themselves, solved, problems, he, and, herodotus, portray, the, carthaginian, government, as, more, meritocratic, than, some, hellenistic, counterparts, with, great, men, like, hamilcar, being, elected, to, royal, office, based, on, outstanding, achievements, and, special, merit, aristotle, also, praises, carthage, s, political, system, for, its, balanced, elements, of, monarchy, aristocracy, and, democracy, his, athenian, contemporary, isocrates, elevates, carthage, s, political, system, as, the, best, in, antiquity, equaled, only, by, that, of, sparta, it, is, noteworthy, that, aristotle, ascribes, to, carthage, a, position, among, the, greek, states, because, the, greeks, firmly, believed, that, they, alone, had, the, ability, to, found, poleis, whereas, the, barbarians, used, to, live, in, tribal, societies, ethne, it, is, therefore, remarkable, that, aristotle, maintained, that, the, carthaginians, were, the, only, non, greek, people, who, had, created, a, polis, like, crete, and, sparta, aristotle, considers, carthage, as, an, outstanding, example, of, an, ideal, society, confirming, aristotle, s, claims, polybius, states, that, during, the, punic, wars, the, carthaginian, public, held, more, sway, over, the, government, than, the, romans, did, over, theirs, however, he, regards, this, development, as, a, fatal, flaw, since, it, led, the, carthaginians, to, bicker, and, debate, while, the, romans, through, the, more, oligarchic, senate, acted, more, quickly, and, decisively, this, may, have, been, due, to, the, influence, and, populism, of, the, barcid, faction, which, from, the, end, of, the, first, punic, war, until, the, conclusion, of, the, second, punic, war, dominated, carthage, s, government, and, military, carthage, reportedly, had, a, constitution, of, some, form, aristotle, compares, carthage, s, constitution, favorably, to, its, well, regarded, spartan, counterpart, describing, it, as, sophisticated, functional, and, fulfilling, all, needs, of, moderation, and, justice, eratosthenes, c, 276, bc, c, 194, bc, a, greek, polymath, and, head, of, the, library, of, alexandria, praises, the, carthaginians, as, among, the, few, barbarians, to, be, refined, and, admirably, governed, some, scholars, suggest, the, greeks, generally, held, carthage, s, institutions, in, high, regard, regarding, the, carthaginians, as, close, to, equal, carthage, s, republican, system, appears, to, have, extended, to, the, rest, of, its, empire, though, to, what, extent, and, in, what, form, remains, unknown, the, term, sufet, was, used, for, officials, throughout, carthaginian, colonies, and, territories, inscriptions, from, punic, era, sardinia, are, dated, with, four, names, the, sufetes, of, the, island, as, well, as, those, of, carthage, this, suggests, some, degree, of, political, coordination, between, local, and, colonial, carthaginians, perhaps, through, a, regional, hierarchy, of, sufetes, carthage, s, emphasis, on, maritime, trade, and, maritime, power, may, have, led, carthaginian, traders, to, attempt, keep, trade, routes, secret, from, their, greek, counterparts, leading, to, wars, between, 600, and, 500, bc, extant, documentation, from, the, early, period, of, carthaginian, greek, contact, and, conflict, suggest, that, carthage, was, protectionist, or, mercantilist, in, economic, policy, with, a, goal, of, ensuring, that, its, african, harbors, served, as, ports, of, export, while, simultaneously, keeping, greek, goods, out, at, the, time, of, its, greatest, territorial, expansion, 264, bc, on, the, eve, of, the, first, war, with, rome, carthage, s, area, of, influence, consisted, of, most, of, the, western, mediterranean, through, its, settlements, in, north, africa, including, western, libya, with, at, least, part, of, the, mauretanian, coast, sicily, sardinia, the, balearic, islands, and, spain, as, well, as, small, islands, such, as, malta, the, aeolian, islands, and, the, pelagie, islands, but, also, by, the, control, it, exercised, over, ancient, phoenician, settlements, such, as, lixus, near, tangier, in, morocco, mogador, present, day, essaouira, on, morocco, s, atlantic, coast, gad, s, present, day, c, diz, in, andalusia, and, utica, among, the, great, punic, cities, there, are, in, addition, to, the, capital, carthage, hadrumetum, ruspina, cartagena, and, hippone, gad, s, and, utica, on, the, territory, of, present, day, tunisia, were, founded, by, the, phoenicians, between, the, 12th, and, 10th, centuries, bc, carthage, was, founded, on, a, peninsula, surrounded, by, lagoons, northeast, of, present, day, tunis, at, the, height, of, its, glory, the, african, empire, of, the, carthaginians, had, a, population, of, 3, 4, million, inhabitants, although, the, type, of, ties, between, carthage, and, the, various, components, of, its, possessions, is, largely, unknown, the, city, was, likely, concerned, with, directing, foreign, policy, and, trade, the, dynamics, that, led, to, the, formation, of, the, empire, of, carthage, and, the, typology, of, the, links, between, it, and, its, dominion, do, not, seem, to, have, been, very, different, from, those, pursued, and, implemented, by, the, roman, state, in, italy, and, then, in, other, areas, a, city, state, which, directly, dominates, a, certain, territory, and, exercises, a, strong, hegemony, over, allied, or, subjugated, cities, and, peoples, with, some, allies, enjoying, privileges, which, equate, them, to, the, hegemon, however, sabatino, moscati, hypothesized, that, incapacity, to, create, a, solid, and, structured, empire, similar, to, the, so, called, roman, italic, federation, was, the, cause, of, its, final, defeat, like, the, republics, of, the, latin, and, hellenistic, worlds, carthage, may, have, had, a, notion, of, citizenship, distinguishing, those, in, society, who, could, participate, in, the, political, process, and, who, had, certain, rights, privileges, and, duties, however, it, remains, uncertain, whether, such, a, distinction, existed, much, less, the, specific, criteria, for, example, while, the, popular, assembly, is, described, as, giving, a, political, voice, to, the, common, people, there, is, no, mention, of, any, restrictions, based, on, citizenship, carthaginian, society, consisted, of, many, classes, including, slaves, peasants, aristocrats, merchants, and, various, professionals, its, empire, consisted, of, an, often, nebulous, network, of, punic, colonies, subject, peoples, client, states, and, allied, tribes, and, kingdoms, it, is, unknown, whether, individuals, from, these, different, realms, and, nationalities, formed, any, particular, social, or, political, class, in, relation, to, the, carthaginian, government, roman, accounts, suggest, that, carthaginian, citizens, especially, those, allowed, to, run, for, high, office, had, to, prove, their, descent, from, the, city, s, founders, this, would, indicate, that, phoenicians, were, privileged, over, other, ethnic, groups, while, those, whose, lineage, traced, back, to, the, city, s, founding, were, privileged, over, fellow, phoenicians, descended, from, later, waves, of, settlers, however, it, would, also, mean, that, someone, of, partial, foreign, ancestry, could, still, be, a, citizen, indeed, hamilcar, who, served, as, a, sufete, in, 480, bc, was, half, greek, greek, writers, claimed, that, ancestry, as, well, as, wealth, and, merit, were, avenues, to, citizenship, and, political, power, as, carthage, was, a, mercantile, society, this, would, imply, that, both, citizenship, and, membership, in, the, aristocracy, were, relatively, accessible, by, ancient, standards, aristotle, mentions, carthaginian, associations, similar, to, the, hetairiai, of, many, greek, cities, which, were, roughly, analogous, to, political, parties, or, interest, groups, these, were, most, likely, the, mizrehim, referenced, in, carthaginian, inscriptions, of, which, little, is, known, or, attested, but, which, appeared, to, have, been, numerous, in, number, and, subject, from, devotional, cults, to, professional, guilds, it, is, unknown, whether, such, an, association, was, required, of, citizens, as, in, some, greek, states, such, as, sparta, aristotle, also, describes, a, carthaginian, equivalent, to, the, syssitia, communal, meals, that, were, the, mark, of, citizenship, and, social, class, in, greek, societies, it, is, again, unclear, whether, carthaginians, attributed, any, political, significance, to, their, equivalent, practice, carthage, s, military, provides, a, glimpse, into, the, criteria, of, citizenship, greek, accounts, describe, a, sacred, band, of, carthage, that, fought, in, sicily, in, the, mid, fourth, century, bc, using, the, hellenistic, term, for, professional, citizen, soldiers, selected, on, the, basis, of, merit, and, ability, roman, writings, about, the, punic, wars, describe, the, core, of, the, military, including, its, commanders, and, officers, as, being, made, up, of, liby, phoenicians, a, broad, label, that, included, ethnic, phoenicians, those, of, mixed, punic, north, african, descent, and, libyans, who, had, integrated, into, phoenician, culture, during, the, second, punic, war, hannibal, promised, his, foreign, troops, carthaginian, citizenship, as, a, reward, for, victory, at, least, two, of, his, foreign, officers, both, greeks, from, syracuse, were, citizens, of, carthage, aspects, of, carthage, s, political, system, persisted, well, into, the, roman, period, albeit, to, varying, degrees, and, often, in, romanized, form, throughout, the, major, settlements, of, roman, sardinia, inscriptions, mention, sufetes, perhaps, indicating, that, punic, descendants, used, the, office, or, its, name, to, resist, both, cultural, and, political, assimilation, with, their, latin, conquerors, as, late, as, the, mid, second, century, ad, two, sufetes, wielded, power, in, bithia, a, sardinian, city, in, the, roman, province, of, sardinia, and, corsica, the, romans, seemed, to, have, actively, tolerated, if, not, adopted, carthaginian, offices, and, institutions, official, state, terminology, of, the, late, roman, republic, and, subsequent, empire, re, purposed, the, word, sufet, to, refer, to, roman, style, local, magistrates, serving, in, africa, proconsularis, which, included, carthage, and, its, core, territories, sufetes, are, attested, to, have, governed, over, forty, post, carthaginian, towns, and, cities, including, althiburos, calama, capsa, cirta, gadiaufala, gales, limisa, mactar, and, thugga, though, many, were, former, carthaginian, settlements, some, had, little, to, no, carthaginian, influence, volubilis, in, modern, day, morocco, had, been, part, of, the, kingdom, of, mauretania, which, became, a, roman, client, state, after, the, fall, of, carthage, the, use, of, sufetes, persisted, well, into, the, late, second, century, ad, sufetes, were, prevalent, even, in, interior, regions, of, roman, africa, which, carthage, had, never, settled, this, suggests, that, unlike, the, punic, community, of, roman, sardinia, punic, settlers, and, refugees, endeared, themselves, to, roman, authorities, by, adopting, a, readily, intelligible, government, three, sufetes, serving, simultaneously, appear, in, first, century, ad, records, at, althiburos, mactar, and, thugga, reflecting, a, choice, to, adopt, punic, nomenclature, for, romanized, institutions, without, the, actual, traditionally, balanced, magistracy, in, those, cases, a, third, non, annual, position, of, tribal, or, communal, chieftain, marked, an, inflection, point, in, the, assimilation, of, external, african, groups, into, the, roman, political, fold, sufes, the, latin, approximation, of, the, term, sufet, appears, in, at, least, six, works, of, latin, literature, erroneous, references, to, carthaginian, kings, with, the, latin, term, rex, betray, the, translations, of, roman, authors, from, greek, sources, who, equated, the, sufet, with, the, more, monarchical, basileus, greek, starting, in, the, late, second, or, early, first, century, bc, after, the, destruction, of, carthage, autonomous, coinage, with, punic, inscriptions, was, minted, in, leptis, magna, leptis, magna, had, free, city, status, was, governed, by, two, sufetes, and, had, public, officials, with, titles, such, as, mhzm, addir, ararim, and, n, quim, l, m, the, military, of, carthage, was, one, of, the, largest, in, the, ancient, world, although, carthage, s, navy, was, always, its, main, military, force, the, army, acquired, a, key, role, in, extending, carthaginian, power, over, the, native, peoples, of, northern, africa, and, the, southern, iberian, peninsula, from, the, sixth, to, third, centuries, bc, since, at, least, the, reign, of, mago, i, in, the, early, sixth, century, bc, carthage, regularly, utilized, its, military, to, advance, its, commercial, and, strategic, interests, according, to, polybius, carthage, relied, heavily, though, not, exclusively, on, foreign, mercenaries, especially, in, overseas, warfare, modern, historians, regard, this, as, an, oversimplification, as, many, foreign, troops, were, actually, auxiliaries, from, allied, or, client, states, provided, through, formal, agreements, tributary, obligations, or, military, pacts, the, carthaginians, maintained, close, relations, sometimes, through, political, marriages, with, the, rulers, of, various, tribes, and, kingdoms, most, notably, the, numidians, based, in, modern, northern, algeria, these, leaders, would, in, turn, provide, their, respective, contingent, of, forces, sometimes, even, leading, them, in, carthaginian, campaigns, in, any, event, carthage, leveraged, its, vast, wealth, and, hegemony, to, help, fill, the, ranks, of, its, military, contrary, to, popular, belief, especially, among, the, more, martial, greeks, and, romans, carthage, did, utilize, citizen, soldiers, i, e, ethnic, punics, phoenicians, particularly, during, the, sicilian, wars, moreover, like, their, greco, roman, contemporaries, the, carthaginians, respected, military, valour, with, aristotle, reporting, the, practice, of, citizens, wearing, armbands, to, signify, their, combat, experience, greek, observers, also, described, the, sacred, band, of, carthage, a, hellenistic, term, for, professional, citizen, soldiers, who, fought, in, sicily, in, the, mid, fourth, century, bc, however, after, this, force, was, destroyed, by, agathocles, in, 310, bc, foreign, mercenaries, and, auxiliaries, formed, a, more, significant, part, of, the, army, this, indicates, that, the, carthaginians, had, a, capacity, to, adapt, their, military, as, circumstances, required, when, larger, or, more, specialized, forces, were, needed, such, as, during, the, punic, wars, they, would, employ, mercenaries, or, auxiliaries, accordingly, carthaginian, citizens, would, be, enlisted, in, large, numbers, only, by, necessity, such, as, for, the, pivotal, battle, of, zama, in, the, second, punic, war, or, in, the, final, siege, of, the, city, in, the, third, punic, war, the, core, of, the, carthaginian, army, was, always, from, its, own, territory, in, northwest, africa, namely, ethnic, libyans, numidians, and, liby, phoenicians, a, broad, label, that, included, ethnic, phoenicians, those, of, mixed, punic, north, african, descent, and, libyans, who, had, integrated, into, phoenician, culture, these, troops, were, supported, by, mercenaries, from, different, ethnic, groups, and, geographic, locations, across, the, mediterranean, who, fought, in, their, own, national, units, for, instance, celts, balearics, and, iberians, were, recruited, in, significant, numbers, to, fight, in, sicily, greek, mercenaries, who, were, highly, valued, for, their, skill, were, hired, for, the, sicilian, campaigns, carthage, employed, iberian, troops, long, before, the, punic, wars, herodotus, and, alcibiades, both, describe, the, fighting, capabilities, of, the, iberians, among, the, western, mediterranean, mercenaries, later, after, the, barcids, conquered, large, portions, of, iberia, modern, spain, and, portugal, iberians, came, to, form, an, even, greater, part, of, the, carthaginian, forces, albeit, based, more, on, their, loyalty, to, the, barcid, faction, than, to, carthage, itself, the, carthaginians, also, fielded, slingers, soldiers, armed, with, straps, of, cloth, used, to, toss, small, stones, at, high, speeds, for, this, they, often, recruited, balearic, islanders, who, were, reputed, for, their, accuracy, the, uniquely, diverse, makeup, of, carthage, s, army, particularly, during, the, second, punic, war, was, noteworthy, to, the, romans, livy, characterized, hannibal, s, army, as, a, hotch, potch, of, the, riff, raff, of, all, nationalities, he, also, observed, that, the, carthaginians, at, least, under, hannibal, never, forced, any, uniformity, upon, their, disparate, forces, which, nonetheless, had, such, a, high, degree, of, unity, that, they, never, quarreled, amongst, themselves, nor, mutinied, even, during, difficult, circumstances, punic, officers, at, all, levels, maintained, some, degree, of, unity, and, coordination, among, these, otherwise, disparate, forces, they, also, dealt, with, the, challenge, of, ensuring, military, commands, were, properly, communicated, and, translated, to, their, respective, foreign, troops, carthage, used, the, diversity, of, its, forces, to, its, own, advantage, capitalizing, on, the, particular, strengths, or, capabilities, of, each, nationality, celts, and, iberians, were, often, utilized, as, shock, troops, north, africans, as, cavalry, and, campanians, from, southern, italy, as, heavy, infantry, moreover, these, units, would, typically, be, deployed, to, nonnative, lands, which, ensured, they, had, no, affinity, for, their, opponents, and, could, surprise, them, with, unfamiliar, tactics, for, example, hannibal, used, iberians, and, gauls, from, what, is, today, france, for, campaigns, in, italy, and, africa, carthage, seems, to, have, fielded, a, formidable, cavalry, force, especially, in, its, northwest, african, homeland, a, significant, part, of, it, was, composed, of, light, numidian, cavalry, who, were, considered, by, far, the, best, horsemen, in, africa, their, speed, and, agility, proved, pivotal, to, several, carthaginian, victories, most, notably, the, battle, of, trebia, the, first, major, action, in, the, second, punic, war, the, reputation, and, effectiveness, of, numidian, cavalry, was, such, that, the, romans, utilized, a, contingent, of, their, own, in, the, decisive, battle, of, zama, where, they, reportedly, turned, the, scales, in, rome, s, favor, polybius, suggests, that, cavalry, remained, the, force, in, which, carthaginian, citizens, were, most, represented, following, the, shift, to, mostly, foreign, troops, after, the, third, century, bc, owing, to, hannibal, s, campaigns, in, the, second, punic, war, carthage, is, perhaps, best, remembered, for, its, use, of, the, now, extinct, north, african, elephant, which, was, specially, trained, for, warfare, and, among, other, uses, was, commonly, utilized, for, frontal, assaults, or, as, anticavalry, protection, an, army, could, field, up, to, several, hundred, of, these, animals, but, on, most, reported, occasions, fewer, than, a, hundred, were, deployed, the, riders, of, these, elephants, were, armed, with, a, spike, and, hammer, to, kill, the, elephants, in, case, they, charged, toward, their, own, army, during, the, sixth, century, bc, carthaginian, generals, became, a, distinct, political, office, known, in, punic, as, rb, mhnt, or, rab, mahanet, unlike, in, other, ancient, societies, carthage, maintained, a, separation, of, military, and, political, power, with, generals, either, appointed, by, the, administration, or, elected, by, citizens, generals, did, not, serve, fixed, terms, but, were, usually, selected, based, on, the, length, or, scale, of, a, war, initially, the, generalship, was, apparently, occupied, by, two, separate, but, equal, offices, such, as, an, army, commander, and, an, admiral, by, the, mid, third, century, military, campaigns, were, usually, carried, out, by, a, supreme, commander, and, a, deputy, during, the, second, punic, war, hannibal, appears, to, have, exercised, total, control, over, all, military, affairs, and, had, up, to, seven, subordinate, generals, divided, along, different, theaters, of, war, carthage, s, navy, usually, operated, in, support, of, its, land, campaigns, which, remained, key, to, its, expansion, and, defense, the, carthaginians, maintained, the, ancient, phoenicians, reputation, as, skilled, mariners, navigators, and, shipbuilders, polybius, wrote, that, the, carthaginians, were, more, exercised, in, maritime, affairs, than, any, other, people, its, navy, was, one, of, the, largest, and, most, powerful, in, the, mediterranean, using, serial, production, to, maintain, high, numbers, at, moderate, cost, during, the, second, punic, war, at, which, point, carthage, had, lost, most, of, its, mediterranean, islands, it, still, managed, to, field, some, 300, to, 350, warships, the, sailors, and, marines, of, the, carthaginian, navy, were, predominantly, recruited, from, the, punic, citizenry, unlike, the, multiethnic, allied, and, mercenary, troops, of, the, carthaginian, army, the, navy, offered, a, stable, profession, and, financial, security, for, its, sailors, which, helped, contribute, to, the, city, s, political, stability, since, the, unemployed, debt, ridden, poor, in, other, cities, were, frequently, inclined, to, support, revolutionary, leaders, in, the, hope, of, improving, their, own, lot, the, reputation, of, carthaginian, sailors, implies, that, the, training, of, oarsmen, and, coxswains, occurred, in, peacetime, giving, the, navy, a, cutting, edge, in, addition, to, its, military, functions, the, carthaginian, navy, was, key, to, the, empire, s, commercial, dominance, helping, secure, trade, routes, protect, harbors, and, even, enforce, trade, monopolies, against, competitors, carthaginian, fleets, also, served, an, exploratory, function, most, likely, for, the, purpose, of, finding, new, trade, routes, or, markets, evidence, exists, of, at, least, one, expedition, that, of, hanno, the, navigator, possibly, sailing, along, the, west, african, coast, to, regions, south, of, the, tropic, of, cancer, in, addition, to, the, use, of, serial, production, carthage, developed, complex, infrastructure, to, support, and, maintain, its, sizable, fleet, cicero, described, the, city, as, surrounded, by, harbours, while, accounts, from, appian, and, strabo, describe, a, large, and, sophisticated, harbor, known, as, the, cothon, greek, lit, drinking, vessel, based, on, similar, structures, used, for, centuries, across, the, phoenician, world, the, cothon, was, a, key, factor, in, carthaginian, naval, supremacy, its, prevalence, throughout, the, empire, is, unknown, but, both, utica, and, motya, had, comparable, harbors, according, to, both, ancient, descriptions, and, modern, archaeological, findings, the, cothon, was, divided, into, a, rectangular, merchant, harbor, followed, by, an, inner, protected, harbor, reserved, for, military, vessels, the, inner, harbor, was, circular, and, surrounded, by, an, outer, ring, of, structures, partitioned, into, docking, bays, along, with, an, island, structure, at, its, centre, that, also, housed, naval, ships, each, individual, docking, bay, featured, a, raised, slipway, allowing, ships, to, be, dry, docked, for, maintenance, and, repair, above, the, raised, docking, bays, was, a, second, level, consisting, of, warehouses, where, oars, and, rigging, were, kept, along, with, supplies, such, as, wood, and, canvas, the, island, structure, had, a, raised, cabin, where, the, admiral, in, command, could, observe, the, whole, harbor, along, with, the, surrounding, sea, altogether, the, inner, docking, complex, could, house, up, to, 220, ships, the, entire, harbor, was, protected, by, an, outer, wall, while, the, main, entrance, could, be, closed, off, with, iron, chains, the, romans, who, had, little, experience, in, naval, warfare, prior, to, the, first, punic, war, managed, to, defeat, carthage, in, part, by, reverse, engineering, captured, carthaginian, ships, aided, by, the, recruitment, of, experienced, greek, sailors, from, conquered, cities, the, unorthodox, corvus, device, and, their, superior, numbers, in, marines, and, rowers, polybius, describes, a, tactical, innovation, of, the, carthaginians, during, the, third, punic, war, consisting, of, augmenting, their, few, triremes, with, small, vessels, that, carried, hooks, to, attack, the, oars, and, fire, to, attack, the, hulls, with, this, new, combination, they, were, able, to, stand, their, ground, against, the, numerically, superior, romans, for, a, whole, day, the, romans, also, utilized, the, cothon, in, their, rebuilding, of, the, city, which, helped, support, the, region, s, commercial, and, strategic, development, carthage, was, unique, in, antiquity, for, separating, political, and, military, offices, and, for, having, the, former, exercise, control, over, the, latter, in, addition, to, being, appointed, or, elected, by, the, state, generals, were, subject, to, reviews, of, their, performance, the, government, was, infamous, for, its, severe, attitude, towards, defeated, commanders, in, some, instances, the, penalty, for, failure, was, execution, usually, by, crucifixion, before, the, fourth, or, fifth, century, bc, generals, were, probably, judged, by, the, supreme, council, and, or, sufetes, until, a, special, tribunal, was, created, specifically, this, function, what, aristotle, calls, the, one, hundred, and, four, described, by, justin, as, being, established, during, the, republican, reforms, led, by, the, magonids, this, body, was, responsible, for, scrutinizing, and, punishing, generals, following, every, military, campaign, its, harshness, was, such, that, some, modern, scholars, describe, it, as, the, nemesis, of, generals, although, the, one, hundred, and, four, was, intended, to, ensure, that, military, leaders, better, served, the, interests, of, carthage, its, draconian, approach, may, also, have, led, to, generals, being, overly, cautious, for, fear, of, reprisal, however, despite, its, notorious, reputation, punishments, are, rarely, recorded, although, an, admiral, named, hanno, was, crucified, for, his, disastrous, defeat, in, the, first, punic, war, other, commanders, including, hannibal, escaped, such, a, fate, this, has, led, some, historians, to, speculate, that, the, tribunal, s, decisions, may, have, been, influenced, by, familial, or, factional, politics, given, that, many, high, ranking, military, officers, or, their, relatives, and, allies, held, political, office, carthaginians, spoke, a, variety, of, phoenician, called, punic, a, semitic, language, originating, in, their, ancestral, homeland, of, phoenicia, present, day, lebanon, like, its, parent, language, punic, was, written, from, right, to, left, in, an, alphabet, consisting, of, 22, consonants, without, vowels, it, is, known, mostly, through, inscriptions, during, classical, antiquity, punic, was, spoken, throughout, carthage, s, territories, and, spheres, of, influence, in, the, western, mediterranean, namely, northwest, africa, and, several, mediterranean, islands, although, the, carthaginians, maintained, ties, and, cultural, affinity, with, their, phoenician, homeland, their, punic, dialect, gradually, became, influenced, by, various, berber, languages, spoken, in, and, around, carthage, by, the, ancient, libyans, following, the, fall, of, carthage, a, neo, punic, dialect, emerged, that, diverged, from, punic, in, terms, of, spelling, conventions, and, the, use, of, non, semitic, names, mostly, of, libyco, berber, origin, this, dialect, most, likely, spread, through, dominant, merchants, and, trade, stops, throughout, the, mediterranean, sea, notwithstanding, the, destruction, of, carthage, and, assimilation, of, its, people, into, the, roman, republic, punic, appears, to, have, persisted, for, centuries, in, the, former, carthaginian, homeland, this, is, best, attested, by, augustine, of, hippo, himself, of, berber, descent, who, spoke, and, understood, punic, and, served, as, the, primary, source, on, the, survival, of, punic, he, claims, the, language, was, still, spoken, in, his, region, of, north, africa, in, the, fifth, century, and, that, there, were, still, people, who, self, identified, as, chanani, canaanite, carthaginian, contemporaneous, funerary, texts, found, in, christian, catacombs, in, sirte, libya, bear, inscriptions, in, ancient, greek, latin, and, punic, suggesting, a, fusion, of, the, cultures, under, roman, rule, there, is, evidence, that, punic, was, still, spoken, and, written, by, commoners, in, sardinia, at, least, 400, years, after, the, roman, conquest, in, addition, to, augustine, of, hippo, punic, was, known, by, some, literate, north, africans, until, the, second, or, third, centuries, albeit, written, in, roman, and, greek, script, and, remained, spoken, among, peasants, at, least, until, the, end, of, the, fourth, century, carthage, s, commerce, extended, by, sea, throughout, the, mediterranean, and, perhaps, as, far, as, the, canary, islands, and, by, land, across, the, sahara, desert, according, to, aristotle, the, carthaginians, had, commercial, treaties, with, various, trading, partners, to, regulate, their, exports, and, imports, their, merchant, ships, which, surpassed, in, number, even, those, of, the, original, phoenician, city, states, visited, every, major, port, of, the, mediterranean, as, well, as, britain, and, the, atlantic, coast, of, africa, these, ships, were, able, to, carry, over, 100, tons, of, goods, archaeological, discoveries, show, evidence, of, all, kinds, of, exchanges, from, the, vast, quantities, of, tin, needed, for, bronze, based, civilizations, to, all, manner, of, textiles, ceramics, and, fine, metalwork, even, between, the, punishing, punic, wars, carthaginian, merchants, remained, at, every, port, in, the, mediterranean, trading, in, harbours, with, warehouses, or, from, ships, beached, on, the, coast, the, empire, of, carthage, depended, heavily, on, its, trade, with, tartessos, and, other, cities, of, the, iberian, peninsula, from, which, it, obtained, vast, quantities, of, silver, lead, copper, and, most, importantly, tin, ore, which, was, essential, to, manufacture, the, bronze, objects, that, were, highly, prized, in, antiquity, carthaginian, trade, relations, with, the, iberians, and, the, naval, might, that, enforced, carthage, s, monopoly, on, this, trade, and, the, atlantic, tin, trade, made, it, the, sole, significant, broker, of, tin, and, maker, of, bronze, in, its, day, maintaining, this, monopoly, was, one, of, the, major, sources, of, power, and, prosperity, for, carthage, carthaginian, merchants, strove, to, keep, the, location, of, the, tin, mines, secret, in, addition, to, its, exclusive, role, as, the, main, distributor, of, tin, carthage, s, central, location, in, the, mediterranean, and, control, of, the, waters, between, sicily, and, tunisia, allowed, it, to, control, the, eastern, peoples, supply, of,

astarte, a, popular, phoenician, deity, was, discovered, in, italy, containing, three, gold, tablets, with, inscriptions, in, etruscan, and, phoenician, giving, tangible, proof, of, the, phoenician, presence, in, the, italian, peninsula, at, the, end, of, the, sixth, century, bc, long, before, the, rise, of, rome, these, inscriptions, imply, a, political, and, commercial, alliance, between, carthage, and, the, etruscan, city, state, of, caere, which, would, corroborate, aristotle, s, statement, that, the, etruscans, and, carthaginians, were, so, close, as, to, form, almost, one, people, the, etruscans, were, at, times, both, commercial, partners, and, military, allies, an, excavation, of, carthage, in, 1977, found, many, artifacts, and, structural, ruins, including, urns, beads, and, amulets, among, the, bedrock, below, the, ruins, excavators, uncovered, engraved, limestones, placed, below, the, surface, of, the, earth, along, with, urns, that, held, the, charred, remains, of,

form, a, deeper, basin, for, their, ships, a, method, that, would, have, been, exceptionally, difficult, in, ancient, times, this, is, especially, important, to, the, history, and, design, of, carthage, because, of, its, importance, on, the, trade, routes, carthage, s, north, african, hinterland, was, famed, in, antiquity, for, its, fertile, soil, and, ability, to, support, abundant,

for, his, low, regard, of, foreign, cultures, described, the, carthaginian, countryside, as, thriving, with, both, human, and, animal, life, polybius, writing, of, his, visit, during, the, same, period, claims, that, a, greater, number, and, variety, of, livestock, were, raised, in, carthage, than, anywhere, else, in, the, known, world, initially, the, carthaginians, like, their, phoenician, founders, did, not, heavily, engage, in, agriculture, like, nearly, all, phoenician, cities, and, colonies, carthage, was, primarily, settled, along, the, coast, evidence, of, settlement, in, the,

sixth, and, fourth, centuries, bc, respectively, carthaginians, were, adept, at, refining, and, reinventing, their, agricultural, techniques, even, in, the, face, of, adversity, after, the, second, punic, war, hannibal, promoted, agriculture, to, help, restore, carthage, s, economy, and, pay, the, costly, war, indemnity, to, rome, 10, 000, talents, or, 800, 000, roman, pounds, of, silver, which, proved, successful, strabo, reports, that, even, in, the, years, leading, up, to, the, third, punic, war, the, otherwise, devastated, and, impoverished, carthage, had, made, its, lands, flourish, once, more, a, strong, indication, of, agriculture, s, importance, to, carthage, can, be, inferred, from, the, fact, that, of, the, few, carthaginian, writers, known, to, modern, historians, two, the, retired, generals, hamilcar, and, mago, concerned, themselves, with, agriculture, and, agronomy, the, latter, wrote, what, was, essentially, an, encyclopedia, on, farming, and, estate, management, that, totaled, twenty, eight, books, its, advice, was, so, well, regarded, that, following, the, destruction, of, the, city, it, was, one, of, the, few, if, not, only, carthaginian, texts, spared, with, the, roman, senate, decreeing, its, translation, into, latin, subsequently, though, the, original, work, is, lost, fragments, and, references, by, roman, and, greek, writers, remain, circumstantial, evidence, suggests, that, carthage, developed, viticulture, and, wine, production, before, the, fourth, century, bc, and, exported, its, wines, widely, as, indicated, by, distinctive, cigar, shaped, carthaginian, amphorae, found, at, archaeological, sites, across, the, western, mediterranean, although, the, contents, of, these, vessels, have, not, been, conclusively, analysed, carthage, also, shipped, large, quantities, of, raisin, wine, known, in, latin, as, passum, which, was, popular, in, antiquity, including, among, the, romans, fruits, such, as, figs, pears, and, pomegranates, which, the, romans, called, punic, apples, as, well, as, nuts, grain, grapes, dates, and, olives, were, grown, in, the, extensive, hinterland, olive, oil, was, processed, and, exported,

had, been, the, most, prominent, aspect, of, the, chief, phoenician, god, baal, but, after, carthage, s, independence, became, the, city, s, patron, god, and, chief, deity, he, was, also, responsible, for, the, fertility, of, crops, his, consort, tanit, known, as, the, face, of, baal, was, the, goddess, of, war, a, virginal, mother, goddess, and, nurse, and, a, symbol, of, fertility, although, a, minor, figure, in, phoenicia, she, was, venerated, as, a, patroness, and, protector, of, carthage, and, was, also, known, by, the, title, rabat, the, female, form, of, rab, chief, while, usually, coupled, with, baal, she, was, always, mentioned, first, the, symbol, of, tanit, a, stylized, female, form, with, outstretched, arms, appears, frequently, in, tombs, mosaics, religious, stelae, and, various, household, items, like, figurines, and, pottery, vessels, the, ubiquity, of, her, symbol, and, the, fact, that, she, is, the, only, carthaginian, deity, with, an, icon, strongly, suggests, she, was, carthage, s, paramount, deity, at, least, in, later, centuries, in, the, third, punic, war, the, romans, identified, her, as, carthage, s, protector, other, carthaginian, deities, attested, in, punic, inscriptions, were, eshmun, the, god, of, health, and, healing, resheph, associated, with, plague, war, or, thunder, kusor, god, of, knowledge, and, hawot, goddess, of, death, astarte, a, goddess, connected, with, fertility, sexuality, and, war, seems, to, have, been, popular, in, early, times, but, became, increasingly, identified, through, tanit, similarly, melqart, the, patron, deity, of, tyre, was, less, prominent, in, carthage, though, he, remained, fairly, popular, his, cult, was, especially, prominent, in, punic, sicily, of, which, he, was, a, protector, and, which, was, subsequently, known, during, carthaginian, rule, as, cape, melqart, as, in, tyre, melqart, was, subject, to, an, important, religious, rite, of, death, and, rebirth, undertaken, either, daily, or, annually, by, a, specialised, priest, known, as, an, awakener, of, the, god, contrary, to, the, frequent, charge, of, impiety, by, greek, and, roman, authors, religion, was, central, to, both, political, and, social, life, in, carthage, the, city, had, as, many, sacred, places, as, athens, and, rome, surviving, punic, texts, indicate, a, very, well, organized, priesthood, class, who, were, drawn, mostly, from, the, elite, class, and, distinguished, from, most, of, the, population, by, being, clean, shaven, as, in, the, levant, temples, were, among, the, wealthiest, and, most, powerful, institutions, in, carthage, and, were, deeply, integrated, into, public, and, political, life, religious, rituals, served, as, a, source, of, political, unity, and, legitimacy, and, were, typically, performed, in, public, or, in, relation, to, state, functions, temples, were, also, important, to, the, economy, as, they, supported, a, large, number, of, specialised, personnel, to, ensure, rituals, were, performed, properly, priests, and, acolytes, performed, different, functions, for, a, variety, of, prices, and, purposes, the, costs, of, various, offerings, or, molk, were, listed, in, great, detail, and, sometimes, bundled, into, different, price, categories, supplicants, were, even, accorded, a, measure, of, consumer, protection, with, temples, giving, notice, that, priests, would, be, fined, for, abusing, the, pricing, structure, of, offerings, the, carthaginians, had, a, high, degree, of, religious, syncretism, incorporating, deities, and, practices, from, the, many, cultures, they, interacted, with, including, greece, egypt, mesopotamia, and, italy, conversely, many, of, its, cults, and, practices, spread, across, the, mediterranean, via, trade, and, colonisation, carthage, also, had, communities, of, jews, greeks, romans, and, libyans, the, egyptian, god, bes, was, popular, for, warding, off, evil, spirits, and, is, featured, prominently, in, punic, mausoleums, isis, the, ancient, egyptian, goddess, whose, cult, spread, across, the, mediterranean, had, a, temple, in, carthage, a, well, preserved, sarcophagus, depicts, one, of, her, priestesses, in, hellenistic, style, the, greek, goddesses, demeter, and, kore, became, prominent, in, the, late, fourth, century, following, the, war, with, syracuse, and, were, worshiped, into, the, second, century, ad, their, cults, attracted, priests, and, priestesses, from, high, ranking, carthaginian, families, and, the, carthaginians, placed, enough, importance, on, their, veneration, to, enlist, greek, residents, to, ensure, their, rituals, were, conducted, properly, melqart, was, increasingly, identified, with, his, greek, counterpart, heracles, and, from, at, least, the, sixth, century, bc, he, was, revered, by, both, greeks, and, carthaginians, an, inscription, in, malta, honors, him, in, both, greek, and, punic, melqart, became, popular, enough, to, serve, as, a, unifying, figure, among, carthage, s, disparate, allies, in, the, wars, against, rome, his, awakening, rite, may, have, persisted, in, numidia, as, late, as, the, second, century, ad, in, their, treaty, with, macedon, in, 215, bc, carthaginian, officials, and, generals, swore, an, oath, to, both, the, greek, and, carthaginian, gods, cippi, and, stelae, of, limestone, are, characteristic, monuments, of, punic, art,

human, remains, placed, within, open, air, sanctuaries, such, sanctuaries, constitute, some, of, the, best, preserved, and, striking, relics, of, punic, civilization, little, is, known, about, carthaginian, rituals, or, theology, for, melqart, s, awakening, rite, see, above, here, and, here, punic, inscriptions, found, in, carthage, attest, to, a, mayumas, festival, probably, involving, the, ritual, portage, of, water, the, word, itself, is, arguably, a, semitic, calque, on, the, greek, hydrophoria, each, text, ends, with, the, words, for, the, lady, for, tanit, face, of, baal, and, for, the, lord, for, baal, of, the, amanus, that, which, so, and, so, vowed, excavations, of, tombs, reveal, utensils, for, food, and, drink, as, well, as, paintings, depicting, what, appears, to, be, a, person, s, soul, approaching, a, walled, city, these, findings, strongly, suggest, a, belief, in, life, after, death, carthage, was, accused, by, both, contemporary, historians, and, its, adversaries, of, child, sacrifice, plutarch, tertullian, orosius, philo, and, diodorus, siculus, all, allege, the, practice, although, herodotus, and, polybius, do, not, sceptics, contend, that, if, carthage, s, critics, were, aware, of, such, a, practice, however, limited, they, would, have, been, horrified, by, it, and, exaggerated, its, extent, due, to, their, polemical, treatment, of, the, carthaginians, according, to, charles, picard, greek, and, roman, critics, objected, not, to, the, killing, of, children, but, to, its, religious, context, in, both, ancient, greece, and, rome, inconvenient, newborns, were, commonly, killed, by, exposure, to, the, elements, the, hebrew, bible, mentions, child, sacrifice, practiced, by, the, canaanites, ancestors, of, the, carthaginians, and, jews, while, greek, sources, allege, that, the, phoenicians, sacrificed, the, sons, of, princes, during, times, of, grave, peril, however, archaeological, evidence, of, human, sacrifice, in, the, levant, remains, sparse, accounts, of, child, sacrifice, in, carthage, date, the, practice, to, the, city, s, founding, in, about, 814, bc, sacrificing, children, was, apparently, distasteful, even, to, carthaginians, and, according, to, plutarch, they, began, to, seek, alternatives, to, offering, up, their, own, children, such, as, buying, children, from, poor, families, or, raising, servant, children, instead, however, carthage, s, priests, reportedly, demanded, youth, in, times, of, crisis, such, as, war, drought, or, famine, contrary, to, plutarch, diodorus, implies, that, noble, children, were, preferred, extreme, crisis, warranted, special, ceremonies, where, up, to, 200, children, of, the, most, affluent, and, powerful, families, were, slain, and, tossed, into, the, burning, pyre, modern, archaeology, in, formerly, punic, areas, has, discovered, a, number, of, large, cemeteries, for, children, and, infants, representing, a, civic, and, religious, institution, for, worship, and, sacrifice, these, sites, are, called, the, tophet, by, archaeologists, as, their, punic, name, is, unknown, these, cemeteries, may, have, been, used, as, graves, for, stillborn, infants, or, children, who, died, very, early, excavations, have, been, interpreted, by, many, scholars, as, confirming, plutarch, s, reports, of, carthaginian, child, sacrifice, an, estimated, 20, 000, urns, were, deposited, between, 400, and, 200, bc, in, the, tophet, discovered, in, the, salammb, neighbourhood, of, present, day, carthage, with, the, practice, continuing, until, the, second, century, the, majority, of, urns, in, this, site, as, well, as, in, similar, sites, in, motya, and, tharros, contained, the, charred, bones, of, infants, or, fetuses, in, rarer, instances, the, remains, of, children, between, the, ages, of, two, and, four, have, been, found, the, bones, of, animals, particularly, lambs, are, also, common, especially, in, earlier, deposits, there, is, a, clear, correlation, between, the, frequency, of, cremation, and, the, well, being, of, the, city, during, crises, cremations, appear, more, frequent, albeit, for, unclear, reasons, one, explanation, is, that, the, carthaginians, sacrificed, children, in, return, for, divine, intervention, however, such, crises, would, naturally, lead, to, increased, child, mortality, and, consequently, more, child, burials, via, cremation, sceptics, maintain, that, the, bodies, of, children, found, in, carthaginian, and, phoenician, cemeteries, were, merely, the, cremated, remains, of, children, who, died, naturally, sergio, ribichini, has, argued, that, the, tophet, was, a, child, necropolis, designed, to, receive, the, remains, of, infants, who, had, died, prematurely, of, sickness, or, other, natural, causes, and, who, for, this, reason, were, offered, to, specific, deities, and, buried, in, a, place, different, from, the, one, reserved, for, the, ordinary, dead, forensic, evidence, further, suggests, that, most, of, the, infants, had, died, prior, to, cremation, dexter, hoyos, argues, that, it, is, impossible, to, determine, a, definitive, answer, to, the, question, of, child, sacrifice, he, notes, that, infant, and, child, mortality, were, high, in, ancient, times, with, perhaps, a, third, of, roman, infants, dying, of, natural, causes, in, the, first, three, centuries, ad, which, not, only, would, explain, the, frequency, of, child, burials, but, would, make, the, regular, large, scale, sacrificing, of, children, an, existential, threat, to, communal, survival, hoyos, also, notes, contradictions, between, the, various, historical, descriptions, of, the, practice, many, of, which, have, not, been, backed, by, modern, archaeology, however, a, 2014, study, argued, that, archaeological, evidence, confirms, that, the, carthaginians, practiced, human, sacrifice, as, with, most, other, aspects, of, carthaginian, civilization, little, is, known, about, its, culture, and, society, beyond, what, can, be, inferred, from, foreign, accounts, and, archaeological, findings, as, a, phoenician, people, the, carthaginians, had, an, affinity, for, trade, seafaring, and, exploration, most, foreign, accounts, about, their, society, focus, on, their, commercial, and, maritime, prowess, unlike, the, phoenicians, however, the, carthaginians, also, became, known, for, their, military, expertise, and, sophisticated, republican, government, their, approach, to, warfare, and, politics, feature, heavily, in, foreign, accounts, during, the, peak, of, its, wealth, and, power, in, the, fourth, and, third, centuries, bc, carthage, was, among, the, largest, metropolises, in, antiquity, its, free, male, population, alone, may, have, numbered, roughly, 200, 000, in, 241, bc, excluding, resident, foreigners, strabo, estimates, a, total, population, of, 700, 000, a, figure, that, was, possibly, drawn, from, polybius, it, is, unclear, if, this, number, includes, all, residents, or, just, free, citizens, contemporary, scholarship, places, the, peak, of, its, population, at, 500, 000, by, 300, bc, which, would, make, carthage, the, largest, city, in, the, world, at, the, time, descriptions, about, carthage, s, commercial, vessels, markets, and, trading, techniques, are, disproportionately, more, common, and, detailed, the, carthaginians, were, equal, parts, renowned, and, infamous, for, their, wealth, and, mercantile, skills, which, garnered, respect, and, admiration, as, well, as, derision, cicero, claimed, that, carthage, s, love, of, trade, and, money, led, to, its, downfall, and, many, greek, and, roman, writers, regularly, described, carthaginians, as, perfidious, greedy, and, treacherous, in, the, early, fifth, century, bc, the, syracusan, leader, hermocrates, reportedly, described, carthage, as, the, richest, city, in, the, world, centuries, later, even, in, its, weakened, state, following, the, first, punic, war, the, universal, view, was, that, carthage, was, the, richest, city, in, world, the, most, well, known, carthaginian, in, the, greco, roman, world, aside, from, military, and, political, leaders, was, probably, the, fictional, hanno, of, the, roman, comedy, poenulus, the, little, carthaginian, or, our, carthaginian, friend, who, is, portrayed, as, a, garish, crafty, and, wealthy, merchant, while, a, simplistic, stereotype, the, carthaginians, do, appear, to, have, had, a, rich, material, culture, excavations, of, carthage, and, its, hinterland, have, discovered, goods, from, all, over, the, mediterranean, and, even, sub, saharan, africa, polybius, claims, that, the, city, s, rich, countryside, supported, all, the, individual, lifestyle, needs, of, its, people, foreign, visitors, including, otherwise, hostile, figures, like, cato, the, censor, and, agathocles, of, syracuse, consistently, described, the, carthaginian, countryside, as, prosperous, and, verdant, with, large, private, estates, beautified, for, their, enjoyment, diodorus, siculus, provides, a, glimpse, of, carthaginian, lifestyle, in, his, description, of, agricultural, land, near, the, city, circa, 310, bc, it, was, divided, into, market, gardens, and, orchards, of, all, sorts, of, fruit, trees, with, many, streams, of, water, flowing, in, channels, irrigating, every, part, there, were, country, homes,

pastured, on, the, plains, and, there, were, meadows, with, grazing, horses, indeed, the, carthaginians, became, as, distinguished, for, their, agricultural, expertise, as, for, their, maritime, commerce, they, appeared, to, have, placed, considerable, social, and, cultural, value, on, farming, gardening, and, livestock, surviving, fragments, of, mago, s, work, concern, the, planting, and,

war, indemnity, to, rome, which, ultimately, proved, successful, this, most, likely, heightened, the, importance, of, agriculture, in, carthaginian, society, ancient, accounts, coupled, with, archaeological, findings, suggest, that, carthage, had, a, complex, urbanized, society, similar, to, the, hellenistic, polis, or, latin, civitas, it, was, characterized, by, strong, civic, engagement, an, active, civil, society, and, class, stratification, inscriptions, on, punic, tombs, and, gravestones, describe, a, wide, variety, of, professions, including, artisans, dock, workers, farmers, cooks, potters, and, others, indicating, a, complex, diversified, economy, that, most, likely, supported, a, variety, of, lifestyles, carthage, had, a, sizable, and, centrally, located, agora, which, served, as, a, hub, of, business, politics, and, social, life, the, agora, likely, included, public, squares, and, plazas, where, the, people, might, gather, for, festivals, or, assemble, for,

well, and, fairly, their, managers, farm, workers, overseers, and, even, slaves, some, ancient, historians, suggest, that, rural, land, ownership, provided, a, new, power, base, among, the, city, s, nobility, which, was, traditionally, dominated, by, merchants, a, 20th, century, historian, opined, that, urban, merchants, owned, rural, farmland, as, an, alternative, source, of, profit, or, even,
