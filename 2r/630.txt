though, some, suggest, it, is, of, thracian, origin, the, founding, myth, of, the, city, has, it, told, that, the, settlement, was, named, after, the, leader, of, the, megarian, colonists, byzas, the, later, byzantines, of, constantinople, themselves, would, maintain, that, the, city, was, named, in, honor, of, two, men, byzas, and, antes, though, this, was, more, likely, just, a, play, on, the,

in, the, early, days, of, greek, colonial, expansion, in, around, 657, bc, by, colonists, of, the, city, state, of, megara, this, is, the, first, major, settlement, that, would, develop, on, the, site, of, later, constantinople, but, the, first, known, settlements, was, that, of, lygos, referred, to, in, pliny, s, natural, histories, apart, from, this, little, is, known, about, this, initial, settlement, the, site, according, to, the, founding, myth, of, the, city, was, abandoned, by, the, time, greek, settlers, from, the, city, state, of, megara, founded, byzantium, in, around, 657, bc, across, from, the, town, of, chalcedon, on, the, asiatic, side, of, the, bosphorus, hesychius, of, miletus, wrote, that, some, claim, that, people, from, megara, who, derived, their, descent, from, nisos, sailed, to, this, place, under, their, leader, byzas, and, invent, the, fable, that, his, name, was, attached, to, the, city, some, versions, of, the, founding, myth, say, byzas, was, the, son, of, a, local, nymph, while, others, say, he, was, conceived, by, one, of, zeus, daughters, and, poseidon, hesychius, also, gives, alternate, versions, of, the, city, s, founding, legend, which, he, attributed, to, old, poets, and, writers, it, is, said, that, the, first, argives, after, having, received, this, prophecy, from, pythia, blessed, are, those, who, will, inhabit, that, holy, city, a, narrow, strip, of, the, thracian, shore, at, the, mouth, of, the, pontos, where, two, pups, drink, of, the, gray, sea, where, fish, and, stag, graze, on, the, same, pasture, set, up, their, dwellings, at, the, place, where, the, rivers, kydaros, and, barbyses, have, their, estuaries, one, flowing, from, the, north, the, other, from, the, west, and, merging, with, the, sea, at, the, altar, of, the, nymph, called, semestre, the, city, maintained, independence, as, a, city, state, until, it, was, annexed, by, darius, i, in, 512, bc, into, the, persian, empire, who, saw, the, site, as, the, optimal, location, to, construct, a, pontoon, bridge, crossing, into, europe, as, byzantium, was, situated, at, the, narrowest, point, in, the, bosphorus, strait, persian, rule, lasted, until, 478, bc, when, as, part, of, the, greek, counterattack, to, the, second, persian, invasion, of, greece, a, greek, army, led, by, the, spartan, general, pausanias, captured, the, city, which, remained, an, independent, yet, subordinate, city, under, the, athenians, and, later, to, the, spartans, after, 411, bc, a, farsighted, treaty, with, the, emergent, power, of, rome, in, c, 150, bc, which, stipulated, tribute, in, exchange, for, independent, status, allowed, it, to, enter, roman, rule, unscathed, this, treaty, would, pay, dividends, retrospectively, as, byzantium, would, maintain, this, independent, status, and, prosper, under, peace, and, stability, in, the, pax, romana, for, nearly, three, centuries, until, the, late, 2nd, century, ad, byzantium, was, never, a, major, influential, city, state, like, that, of, athens, corinth, or, sparta, but, the, city, enjoyed, relative, peace, and, steady, growth, as, a, prosperous, trading, city, lent, by, its, remarkable, position, the, site, lay, astride, the, land, route, from, europe, to, asia, and, the, seaway, from, the, black, sea, to, the, mediterranean, and, had, in, the, golden, horn, an, excellent, and, spacious, harbor, already, then, in, greek, and, early, roman, times, byzantium, was, famous, for, the, strategic, geographic, position, that, made, it, difficult, to, besiege, and, capture, and, its, position, at, the, crossroads, of, the, asiatic, european, trade, route, over, land, and, as, the, gateway, between, the, mediterranean, and, black, seas, made, it, too, valuable, a, settlement, to, abandon, as, emperor, septimius, severus, later, realized, when, he, razed, the, city, to, the, ground, for, supporting, pescennius, niger, s, claimancy, it, was, a, move, greatly, criticized, by, the, contemporary, consul, and, historian, cassius, dio, who, said, that, severus, had, destroyed, a, strong, roman, outpost, and, a, base, of, operations, against, the, barbarians, from, pontus, and, asia, he, would, later, rebuild, byzantium, towards, the, end, of, his, reign, in, which, it, would, be, briefly, renamed, augusta, antonina, fortifying, it, with, a, new, city, wall, in, his, name, the, severan, wall, constantine, had, altogether, more, colourful, plans, having, restored, the, unity, of, the, empire, and, being, in, the, course, of, major, governmental, reforms, as, well, as, of, sponsoring, the, consolidation, of, the, christian, church, he, was, well, aware, that, rome, was, an, unsatisfactory, capital, rome, was, too, far, from, the, frontiers, and, hence, from, the, armies, and, the, imperial, courts, and, it, offered, an, undesirable, playground, for, disaffected, politicians, yet, it, had, been, the, capital, of, the, state, for, over, a, thousand, years, and, it, might, have, seemed, unthinkable, to, suggest, that, the, capital, be, moved, to, a, different, location, nevertheless, constantine, identified, the, site, of, byzantium, as, the, right, place, a, place, where, an, emperor, could, sit, readily, defended, with, easy, access, to, the, danube, or, the, euphrates, frontiers, his, court, supplied, from, the, rich, gardens, and, sophisticated, workshops, of, roman, asia, his, treasuries, filled, by, the, wealthiest, provinces, of, the, empire, constantinople, was, built, over, six, years, and, consecrated, on, 11, may, 330, constantine, divided, the, expanded, city, like, rome, into, 14, regions, and, ornamented, it, with, public, works, worthy, of, an, imperial, metropolis, yet, at, first, constantine, s, new, rome, did, not, have, all, the, dignities, of, old, rome, it, possessed, a, proconsul, rather, than, an, urban, prefect, it, had, no, praetors, tribunes, or, quaestors, although, it, did, have, senators, they, held, the, title, clarus, not, clarissimus, like, those, of, rome, it, also, lacked, the, panoply, of, other, administrative, offices, regulating, the, food, supply, police, statues, temples, sewers, aqueducts, or, other, public, works, the, new, programme, of, building, was, carried, out, in, great, haste, columns, marbles, doors, and, tiles, were, taken, wholesale, from, the, temples, of, the, empire, and, moved, to, the, new, city, in, similar, fashion, many, of, the, greatest, works, of, greek, and, roman, art, were, soon, to, be, seen, in, its, squares, and, streets, the, emperor, stimulated, private, building, by, promising, householders, gifts, of, land, from, the, imperial, estates, in, asiana, and, pontica, and, on, 18, may, 332, he, announced, that, as, in, rome, free, distributions, of, food, would, be, made, to, the, citizens, at, the, time, the, amount, is, said, to, have, been, 80, 000, rations, a, day, doled, out, from, 117, distribution, points, around, the, city,

descended, the, first, hill, of, the, city, and, climbed, the, second, hill, it, passed, on, the, left, the, praetorium, or, law, court, then, it, passed, through, the, oval, forum, of, constantine, where, there, was, a, second, senate, house, and, a, high, column, with, a, statue, of, constantine, himself, in, the, guise, of, helios, crowned, with, a, halo, of, seven, rays, and, looking, toward, the, rising, sun, from, there, the, mese, passed, on, and, through, the, forum, tauri, and, then, the, forum, bovis, and, finally, up, the, seventh, hill, or, xerolophus, and, through, to, the,

or, some, 1, 400, ha, the, importance, of, constantinople, increased, but, it, was, gradual, from, the, death, of, constantine, in, 337, to, the, accession, of, theodosius, i, emperors, had, been, resident, only, in, the, years, 337, 338, 347, 351, 358, 361, 368, 369, its, status, as, a, capital, was, recognized, by, the, appointment, of, the, first, known, urban, prefect, of, the, city, honoratus, who, held, office, from, 11, december, 359, until, 361, the, urban, prefects, had, concurrent, jurisdiction, over, three, provinces, each, in, the, adjacent, dioceses, of, thrace, in,

miletus, to, replace, it, with, a, new, and, incomparable, hagia, sophia, this, was, the, great, cathedral, of, the, city, whose, dome, was, said, to, be, held, aloft, by, god, alone, and, which, was, directly, connected, to, the, palace, so, that, the, imperial, family, could, attend, services, without, passing, through, the, streets, the, architectural, form, of, the, building, was, meant, to, reflect, justinian, programmatic, harmony, the, circular, dome, a, symbol, of, secular, authority, in, classical, roman, architecture, would, be, harmoniously, combined, with, the, rectangular, form, typical, for, christian, and, pre, christian, temples, the, dedication, took, place, on, 26, december, 537, in, the, presence, of, the, emperor, who, was, later, reported, to, have, exclaimed, o,

and, penetrated, deep, into, anatolia, heraclius, son, of, the, exarch, of, africa, set, sail, for, the, city, and, assumed, the, throne, he, found, the, military, situation, so, dire, that, he, is, said, to, have, contemplated, withdrawing, the, imperial, capital, to, carthage, but, relented, after, the, people, of, constantinople, begged, him, to, stay, the, citizens, lost, their, right, to, free, grain, in, 618, when, heraclius, realized, that, the, city, could, no, longer, be, supplied, from, egypt, as, a, result, of, the, persian, wars, the, population, fell, substantially, as, a, result, while, the, city, withstood, a, siege, by, the, sassanids, and, avars, in, 626, heraclius, campaigned, deep, into, persian, territory, and, briefly, restored, the, status, quo, in, 628, when, the, persians, surrendered, all, their, conquests, however, further, sieges, followed, the, arab, conquests, first, from, 674, to, 678, and, then, in, 717, to, 718, the, theodosian, walls, kept, the,

widow, of, the, emperor, theophilus, died, 842, acted, as, regent, during, the, minority, of, her, son, michael, iii, who, was, said, to, have, been, introduced, to, dissolute, habits, by, her, brother, bardas, when, michael, assumed, power, in, 856, he, became, known, for, excessive, drunkenness, appeared, in, the, hippodrome, as, a, charioteer, and, burlesqued, the, religious, processions, of, the, clergy, he, removed, theodora, from, the, great, palace, to, the, carian, palace, and, later, to, the, monastery, of, gastria, but, after, the, death, of, bardas, she, was, released, to,

monasteries, and, other, properties, on, the, suburban, princes, islands, oryphas, the, admiral, of, the, byzantine, fleet, alerted, the, emperor, michael, who, promptly, put, the, invaders, to, flight, but, the, suddenness, and, savagery, of, the, onslaught, made, a, deep, impression, on, the, citizens, in, 980, the, emperor, basil, ii, received, an, unusual, gift, from, prince, vladimir, of, kiev, 6, 000, varangian, warriors, which, basil, formed, into, a, new, bodyguard, known, as, the, varangian, guard, they, were, known, for, their, ferocity, honour, and, loyalty, it, is, said, that, in, 1038, they, were, dispersed, in, winter, quarters, in, the, thracesian, theme, when, one, of, their, number, attempted, to, violate, a, countrywoman, but, in, the, struggle, she, seized, his, sword, and, killed, him, instead, of, taking, revenge, however, his, comrades, applauded, her, conduct, compensated, her, with, all, his, possessions, and, exposed, his, body, without, burial, as, if, he, had, committed, suicide, however, following, the, death, of, an, emperor, they, became, known, also, for, plunder, in, the, imperial, palaces, later, in, the, 11th, century, the, varangian, guard, became, dominated, by, anglo, saxons, who, preferred, this, way, of, life, to, subjugation, by, the, new, norman, kings, of, england, the, book, of, the, eparch, which, dates, to, the, 10th, century, gives, a, detailed, picture, of, the, city, s, commercial, life, and, its, organization, at, that, time, the, corporations, in, which, the, tradesmen, of, constantinople, were, organised, were, supervised, by, the, eparch, who, regulated, such, matters, as, production, prices, import, and, export, each, guild, had, its, own, monopoly, and, tradesmen, might, not, belong, to, more, than, one, it, is, an, impressive, testament, to, the, strength, of, tradition, how, little, these, arrangements, had, changed, since, the, office, then, known, by, the, latin, version, of, its, title, had, been, set, up, in, 330, to, mirror, the, urban, prefecture, of, rome, in, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, constantinople, had, a, population, of, between, 500, 000, and, 800, 000, in, the,

restored, the, veneration, of, images, through, the, agency, of, the, second, council, of, nicaea, in, 787, the, iconoclast, controversy, returned, in, the, early, 9th, century, only, to, be, resolved, once, more, in, 843, during, the, regency, of, empress, theodora, who, restored, the, icons, these, controversies, contributed, to, the, deterioration, of, relations, between, the, western, and, the, eastern, churches, in, 1027, ad, a, concession, between, the, byzantine, empire, and, fatimid, caliphate, for, the, rebuilding, of, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, the, mosque, in,

alp, arslan, sultan, of, the, seljuk, turks, were, not, excessive, and, romanus, accepted, them, on, his, release, however, romanus, found, that, enemies, had, placed, their, own, candidate, on, the, throne, in, his, absence, he, surrendered, to, them, and, suffered, death, by, torture, and, the, new, ruler, michael, vii, ducas, refused, to, honour, the, treaty, in, response, the, turks, began, to, move, into, anatolia, in, 1073, the, collapse, of, the, old, defensive, system, meant, that, they, met, no, opposition, and, the, empire, s, resources, were, distracted, and, squandered, in, a, series, of, civil, wars, thousands, of, turkoman, tribesmen, crossed, the, unguarded, frontier, and, moved, into, anatolia, by, 1080, a, huge, area, had, been, lost, to, the, empire, and, the, turks,

for, constantinople, in, the, 12th, century, vary, from, some, 100, 000, to, 500, 000, and, towns, and, cities, across, the, realm, flourished, meanwhile, the, volume, of, money, in, circulation, dramatically, increased, this, was, reflected, in, constantinople, by, the, construction, of, the, blachernae, palace, the, creation, of, brilliant, new, works, of, art, and, general, prosperity, at, this, time, an, increase, in, trade, made, possible, by, the, growth, of, the, italian, city, states, may, have, helped, the, growth, of, the, economy, it, is, certain, that, the, venetians, and, others, were, active, traders, in, constantinople, making, a, living, out, of, shipping, goods, between, the, crusader, kingdoms, of, outremer, and, the, west, while, also, trading, extensively, with, byzantium, and, egypt, the, venetians, had, factories, on, the, north, side, of, the, golden, horn, and, large, numbers, of, westerners, were, present, in, the, city, throughout, the, 12th, century,

12th, century, was, a, very, productive, period, there, was, a, revival, in, the, mosaic, art, for, example, mosaics, became, more, realistic, and, vivid, with, an, increased, emphasis, on, depicting, three, dimensional, forms, there, was, an, increased, demand, for, art, with, more, people, having, access, to, the, necessary, wealth, to, commission, and, pay, for, such, work, on, 25, july, 1197, constantinople, was, struck, by, a, severe, fire, which, burned, the, latin, quarter, and, the, area, around, the, gate, of, the, droungarios, turkish, odun, kap, s, on, the, golden, horn, nevertheless, the, destruction, wrought, by, the, 1197, fire, paled, in, comparison, with, that, brought, by, the, crusaders, in, the, course, of, a, plot, between, philip, of, swabia, boniface, of,

found, the, treasury, inadequate, and, was, unable, to, make, good, the, rewards, he, had, promised, to, his, western, allies, tension, between, the, citizens, and, the, latin, soldiers, increased, in, january, 1204, the, protovestiarius, alexios, murzuphlos, provoked, a, riot, it, is, presumed, to, intimidate, alexios, iv, but, whose, only, result, was, the, destruction, of, the, great, statue, of, athena, promachos, the, work, of, phidias, which, stood, in, the, principal, forum, facing, west, in, february, 1204, the, people, rose, again, alexios, iv, was, imprisoned, and, executed, and, murzuphlos, took, the, purple, as, alexios, v, doukas, he, made, some, attempt, to, repair, the, walls, and, organise, the, citizenry, but, there, had, been, no, opportunity, to, bring, in, troops, from, the, provinces, and, the, guards, were, demoralised, by, the, revolution, an, attack, by, the, crusaders, on, 6, april, failed, but, a, second, from, the, golden, horn, on, 12, april, succeeded, and, the, invaders, poured, in, alexios, v, fled, the, senate, met, in, hagia, sophia, and, offered, the, crown, to, theodore, lascaris, who, had, married, into, the, angelos, dynasty, but, it, was, too, late, he, came, out, with, the, patriarch, to, the, golden, milestone, before, the, great, palace, and, addressed, the, varangian, guard, then, the, two, of, them, slipped, away, with, many, of, the, nobility, and, embarked, for, asia, by, the, next, day, the, doge, and, the, leading, franks, were, installed, in, the, great, palace, and, the, city, was, given, over, to, pillage, for, three, days, sir, steven, runciman, historian, of, the, crusades, wrote, that, the, sack, of, constantinople, is, unparalleled, in, history, for, nine, centuries, the, great, city, had, been, the, capital, of, christian, civilization, it, was, filled, with, works, of, art, that, had, survived, from, ancient, greece, and, with, the, masterpieces, of, its, own, exquisite, craftsmen, the, venetians, seized, treasures, and, carried, them, off, to, adorn, their, town, but, the, frenchmen, and, flemings, were, filled, with, a, lust, for, destruction, they, rushed, in, a, howling, mob, down, the, streets, and, through, the, houses, snatching, up, everything, that, glittered, and, destroying, whatever, they, could, not, carry, pausing, only, to, murder, or, to, rape, or, to, break, open, the,

prominently, the, hagia, sophia, which, became, the, cathedral, of, the, latin, patriarch, of, constantinople, it, is, to, these, that, e, h, swift, attributed, the, construction, of, a, series, of, flying, buttresses, to, shore, up, the, walls, of, the, church, which, had, been, weakened, over, the, centuries, by, earthquake, tremors, however, this, act, of, maintenance, is, an, exception, for, the, most, part, the, latin, occupiers, were, too, few, to, maintain, all, of, the, buildings, either, secular, and, sacred, and, many, became, targets, for, vandalism, or, dismantling, bronze, and, lead, were, removed, from, the, roofs, of, abandoned, buildings, and, melted, down, and, sold, to, provide, money, to, the, chronically, under, funded, empire, for, defense, and, to, support, the,

emperor, achieved, this, by, summoning, former, residents, who, had, fled, the, city, when, the, crusaders, captured, it, and, by, relocating, greeks, from, the, recently, reconquered, peloponnese, to, the, capital, military, defeats, civil, wars, earthquakes, and, natural, disasters, were, joined, by, the, black, death, which, in, 1347, spread, to, constantinople, exacerbated, the, people, s,
