https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investiture_Controversy
the, investiture, controversy, or, investiture, contest, german, investiturstreit, pronounced, was, a, conflict, between, the, church, and, the, state, in, medieval, europe, over, the, ability, to, choose, and, install, bishops, investiture, and, abbots, of, monasteries, and, the, pope, himself, a, series, of, popes, in, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, undercut, the, power, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, and, other, european, monarchies, and, the, controversy, led, to, nearly, 50, years, of, conflict, it, began, as, a, power, struggle, between, pope, gregory, vii, and, henry, iv, then, king, later, holy, roman, emperor, in, 1076, the, conflict, ended, in, 1122, when, pope, callixtus, ii, and, emperor, henry, v, agreed, on, the, concordat, of, worms, the, agreement, required, bishops, to, swear, an, oath, of, fealty, to, the, secular, monarch, who, held, authority, by, the, lance, but, left, selection, to, the, church, it, affirmed, the, right, of, the, church, to, invest, bishops, with, sacred, authority, symbolized, by, a, ring, and, staff, in, germany, but, not, italy, and, burgundy, the, emperor, also, retained, the, right, to, preside, over, elections, of, abbots, and, bishops, by, church, authorities, and, to, arbitrate, disputes, holy, roman, emperors, renounced, the, right, to, choose, the, pope, in, the, meantime, there, was, also, a, brief, but, significant, investiture, struggle, between, pope, paschal, ii, and, king, henry, i, of, england, from, 1103, to, 1107, the, earlier, resolution, to, that, conflict, the, concordat, of, london, was, very, similar, to, the, concordat, of, worms, after, the, decline, of, the, western, roman, empire, investiture, was, performed, by, members, of, the, ruling, nobility, and, was, known, as, lay, investiture, despite, theoretically, being, a, task, of, the, church, many, bishops, and, abbots, were, themselves, part, of, the, ruling, nobility, given, that, most, members, of, the, european, nobility, practiced, primogeniture, and, willed, their, titles, of, nobility, to, the, eldest, surviving, male, heir, surplus, male, siblings, often, sought, careers, in, the, upper, levels, of, the, church, hierarchy, this, was, particularly, true, where, the, family, may, have, established, a, proprietary, church, or, abbey, on, their, estate, since, a, substantial, amount, of, wealth, and, land, was, usually, associated, with, the, office, of, a, bishop, or, abbot, the, sale, of, church, offices, a, practice, known, as, simony, was, an, important, source, of, income, for, leaders, among, the, nobility, who, themselves, owned, the, land, and, by, charity, allowed, the, building, of, churches, emperors, had, been, heavily, relying, on, bishops, for, their, secular, administration, as, they, were, not, hereditary, or, quasi, hereditary, nobility, with, family, interests, they, justified, their, power, by, the, theory, of, the, divine, right, of, kings, many, of, the, papal, selections, before, 1059, were, influenced, politically, and, militarily, by, european, powers, often, with, a, king, or, emperor, announcing, a, choice, which, would, be, rubber, stamped, by, church, electors, the, holy, roman, emperors, of, the, ottonian, dynasty, believed, they, should, have, the, power, to, appoint, the, pope, since, the, ascendance, of, the, first, of, that, line, otto, the, great, 936, 72, the, bishops, had, been, princes, of, the, empire, had, secured, many, privileges, and, had, become, to, a, great, extent, feudal, lords, over, great, districts, of, the, imperial, territory, the, control, of, these, great, units, of, economic, and, military, power, was, for, the, king, a, question, of, primary, importance, due, to, its, effect, on, imperial, authority, it, was, essential, for, a, ruler, or, nobleman, to, appoint, or, sell, the, office, to, someone, who, would, remain, loyal, problems, with, simony, became, particularly, unpopular, as, pope, benedict, ix, was, accused, of, selling, the, papacy, in, 1045, henry, iii, holy, roman, emperor, from, 1046, to, 1056, settled, the, papal, schism, and, named, several, popes, the, last, emperor, to, successfully, dominate, the, selection, process, six, year, old, henry, iv, became, king, of, the, germans, in, 1056, benedict, x, was, elected, under, the, influence, of, the, count, of, tusculum, allegedly, by, bribing, the, electors, dissenting, cardinals, elected, pope, nicholas, ii, in, 1058, at, siena, nicholas, ii, successfully, waged, war, against, benedict, x, and, regained, control, of, the, vatican, nicholas, ii, convened, a, synod, in, the, lateran, on, easter, in, 1059, the, results, were, codified, in, the, papal, bull, in, nomine, domini, it, declared, that, leaders, of, the, nobility, would, have, no, part, in, the, selection, of, popes, though, the, holy, roman, emperor, might, confirm, the, choice, and, that, electors, would, be, cardinals, which, would, later, evolve, into, the, college, of, cardinals, assembled, in, rome, the, bull, also, banned, lay, investiture, in, response, all, the, bishops, in, germany, who, supported, the, emperor, assembled, in, 1061, and, declared, all, the, decrees, of, nicholas, ii, null, and, void, nevertheless, the, elections, of, pope, alexander, ii, and, pope, gregory, vii, proceeded, according, to, church, rules, without, the, involvement, of, the, emperor, in, 1075, pope, gregory, vii, composed, the, dictatus, papae, though, this, was, not, published, at, the, time, cataloging, principles, of, his, gregorian, reforms, one, clause, asserted, that, the, pope, held, the, exclusive, power, to, depose, an, emperor, it, declared, that, the, roman, church, was, founded, by, god, alone, that, the, papal, power, the, auctoritas, of, pope, gelasius, was, the, sole, universal, power, in, particular, a, council, held, in, the, lateran, palace, from, 24, to, 28, february, the, same, year, decreed, that, the, pope, alone, could, appoint, or, depose, churchmen, or, move, them, from, see, to, see, by, this, time, henry, iv, was, no, longer, a, child, and, he, continued, to, appoint, his, own, bishops, he, reacted, to, this, declaration, by, sending, gregory, vii, a, letter, in, which, he, withdrew, his, imperial, support, of, gregory, as, pope, in, no, uncertain, terms, the, letter, was, headed, henry, king, not, through, usurpation, but, through, the, holy, ordination, of, god, to, hildebrand, at, present, not, pope, but, false, monk, it, called, for, the, election, of, a, new, pope, his, letter, ends, i, henry, king, by, the, grace, of, god, with, all, of, my, bishops, say, to, you, come, down, come, down, and, is, often, quoted, with, and, to, be, damned, throughout, the, ages, which, is, a, later, addition, the, situation, was, made, even, more, dire, when, henry, iv, installed, his, chaplain, tedald, a, milanese, priest, as, bishop, of, milan, when, another, priest, of, milan, atto, had, already, been, chosen, in, rome, by, the, pope, in, 1076, gregory, responded, by, excommunicating, henry, and, deposed, him, as, german, king, releasing, all, christians, from, their, oath, of, allegiance, enforcing, these, declarations, was, a, different, matter, but, the, advantage, gradually, came, to, be, on, the, side, of, gregory, vii, german, princes, and, the, aristocracy, were, happy, to, hear, of, the, king, s, deposition, they, used, religious, reasons, to, continue, the, rebellion, started, at, the, first, battle, of, langensalza, in, 1075, and, to, seize, royal, holdings, aristocrats, claimed, local, lordships, over, peasants, and, property, built, forts, which, had, previously, been, outlawed, and, built, up, localized, fiefdoms, to, secure, their, autonomy, from, the, empire, this, combination, of, factors, forced, henry, iv, to, back, down, as, he, needed, time, to, marshal, his, forces, to, fight, the, rebellion, in, 1077, he, traveled, to, canossa, in, northern, italy, where, the, pope, was, staying, in, the, castle, of, countess, matilda, to, apologize, in, person, the, pope, was, suspicious, of, henry, s, motives, and, did, not, believe, he, was, truly, repentant, as, penance, for, his, sins, and, echoing, his, own, punishment, of, the, saxons, after, the, first, battle, of, langensalza, he, wore, a, hair, shirt, and, stood, barefoot, in, the, snow, in, what, has, become, known, as, the, walk, to, canossa, gregory, lifted, the, excommunication, but, the, german, aristocrats, whose, rebellion, became, known, as, the, great, saxon, revolt, were, not, as, willing, to, give, up, their, opportunity, and, elected, a, rival, king, rudolf, von, rheinfeld, three, years, later, pope, gregory, declared, his, support, for, von, rheinfeld, and, then, on, the, lenten, synod, of, 7, march, 1080, excommunicated, henry, iv, again, in, turn, henry, called, a, council, of, bishops, at, brixen, that, proclaimed, gregory, illegitimate, the, internal, revolt, against, henry, effectively, ended, that, same, year, however, when, rudolf, von, rheinfeld, died, henry, iv, named, guibert, of, ravenna, who, he, had, invested, as, bishop, of, ravenna, to, be, pope, referring, to, clement, iii, known, by, the, catholic, church, as, antipope, clement, iii, as, our, pope, in, october, 1080, troops, raised, by, the, pro, imperial, bishops, of, northern, italy, clashed, with, the, pro, papal, forces, of, countess, matilda, in, the, battle, of, volta, mantovana, the, pro, imperial, forces, were, victorious, and, in, march, 1081, henry, iv, marched, from, the, brenner, pass, into, the, march, of, verona, unopposed, entering, milan, in, april, that, year, he, then, attacked, rome, and, besieged, the, city, with, the, intent, of, forcibly, removing, gregory, vii, and, installing, clement, iii, the, city, of, rome, withstood, the, siege, but, the, vatican, and, st, peter, s, fell, in, 1083, on, the, outskirts, of, the, city, henry, gained, thirteen, cardinals, who, became, loyal, to, his, cause, the, next, year, the, city, of, rome, surrendered, and, henry, triumphantly, entered, the, city, on, palm, sunday, 1084, henry, iv, solemnly, enthroned, clement, at, st, peter, s, basilica, on, easter, day, clement, returned, the, favour, and, crowned, henry, iv, as, emperor, of, the, holy, roman, empire, gregory, vii, was, meanwhile, still, resisting, a, few, hundred, yards, away, from, the, basilica, in, the, castel, sant, angelo, then, known, as, the, house, of, cencius, gregory, called, on, his, allies, for, help, and, robert, guiscard, the, norman, ruler, of, sicily, apulia, and, calabria, responded, entering, rome, on, 27, may, 1084, the, normans, came, in, force, and, attacked, with, such, strength, that, henry, and, his, army, fled, gregory, vii, was, rescued, but, rome, was, plundered, in, the, process, for, which, the, citizens, of, rome, blamed, him, as, a, result, gregory, vii, was, forced, to, leave, rome, under, the, protection, of, the, normans, fleeing, to, salerno, where, he, grew, ill, and, died, on, 25, may, 1085, the, last, words, he, uttered, were, i, have, loved, justice, and, hated, iniquity, and, therefore, i, die, in, exile, upon, the, death, of, gregory, the, cardinals, elected, a, new, pope, pope, victor, iii, he, owed, his, elevation, to, the, influence, of, the, normans, antipope, clement, iii, still, occupied, st, peter, s, when, victor, iii, died, the, cardinals, elected, pope, urban, ii, 1088, 99, he, was, one, of, three, men, gregory, vii, suggested, as, his, successor, urban, ii, preached, the, first, crusade, which, united, western, europe, and, more, importantly, reconciled, the, majority, of, bishops, who, had, abandoned, gregory, vii, the, reign, of, henry, iv, showed, the, weakness, of, the, german, monarchy, the, ruler, was, dependent, upon, the, good, will, of, the, nobility, of, his, land, these, were, technically, royal, officials, and, hereditary, princes, he, was, also, dependent, on, the, resources, of, the, churches, henry, iv, alienated, the, church, of, rome, and, many, of, the, magnates, in, his, own, kingdom, many, of, these, spent, years, in, open, or, subversive, rebellion, henry, failed, to, create, a, proper, bureaucracy, to, replace, his, disobedient, vassals, the, magnates, became, increasingly, independent, and, the, church, withdrew, support, henry, iv, spent, the, last, years, of, his, life, desperately, grasping, to, keep, his, throne, it, was, a, greatly, diminished, kingdom, the, investiture, controversy, continued, for, several, decades, as, each, successive, pope, tried, to, diminish, imperial, power, by, stirring, up, revolt, in, germany, these, revolts, were, gradually, successful, the, reign, of, henry, iv, ended, with, a, diminished, kingdom, and, waning, power, many, of, his, underlords, had, been, in, constant, or, desultory, revolt, for, years, henry, iv, s, insistence, that, antipope, clement, iii, was, the, real, pope, had, initially, been, popular, with, some, of, the, nobles, and, even, many, of, the, bishops, of, germany, but, as, years, passed, this, support, was, slowly, withdrawn, the, idea, that, the, german, king, could, and, should, name, the, pope, was, increasingly, discredited, and, viewed, as, an, anachronism, from, a, by, gone, era, the, empire, of, the, ottos, was, virtually, lost, because, of, henry, iv, on, 31, december, 1105, henry, iv, was, forced, to, abdicate, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, henry, v, who, had, rebelled, against, his, father, in, favor, of, the, papacy, and, made, his, father, renounce, the, legality, of, his, antipopes, before, he, died, nevertheless, henry, v, chose, another, antipope, gregory, viii, henry, v, realised, swift, action, and, a, change, in, his, father, s, policy, was, necessary, pope, paschal, ii, rebuked, henry, v, for, appointing, bishops, in, germany, the, king, crossed, the, alps, with, an, army, in, 1111, the, pope, who, was, weak, and, had, few, supporters, was, forced, to, suggest, a, compromise, the, abortive, concordat, of, 1111, its, simple, and, radical, solution, of, the, investiture, controversy, between, the, prerogatives, of, regnum, and, sacerdotium, proposed, that, german, churchmen, would, surrender, their, lands, and, secular, offices, to, the, emperor, and, constitute, a, purely, spiritual, church, henry, gained, greater, control, over, the, lands, of, his, kingdom, especially, those, that, had, been, in, the, hands, of, the, church, but, of, contested, title, he, would, not, interfere, with, ecclesiastical, affairs, and, churchmen, would, avoid, secular, services, the, church, would, be, given, autonomy, and, to, henry, v, would, be, restored, large, parts, of, his, empire, that, his, father, had, lost, and, finally, henry, v, would, be, crowned, as, the, holy, roman, emperor, by, paschal, when, the, concessions, of, land, were, read, in, st, peter, s, however, the, crowd, erupted, in, anger, henry, took, the, pope, and, cardinals, hostage, until, the, pope, granted, henry, v, the, right, of, investiture, then, he, returned, to, germany, crowned, emperor, and, apparent, victor, over, the, papacy, henry, s, victory, was, however, as, short, lived, as, that, of, his, father, henry, iv, over, gregory, vii, the, clergy, urged, paschal, to, rescind, his, agreement, which, he, did, in, 1112, the, quarrel, followed, the, predictable, course, henry, v, rebelled, and, was, excommunicated, riots, broke, out, in, germany, a, new, antipope, gregory, viii, was, appointed, by, the, german, king, and, nobles, loyal, to, rome, seceded, from, henry, the, unrest, and, conflict, in, germany, continued, just, as, under, henry, iv, and, the, controversy, with, respect, to, investiture, dragged, on, for, another, ten, years, like, his, father, before, him, henry, v, was, faced, with, waning, power, ultimately, he, had, no, choice, but, to, give, up, investiture, and, the, old, right, of, naming, the, pope, the, concordat, of, worms, in, 1122, was, the, result, after, the, concordat, the, german, kings, never, had, the, same, control, over, the, church, as, had, existed, in, the, time, of, the, ottonian, dynasty, henry, v, was, received, back, into, communion, and, recognized, as, legitimate, emperor, as, a, result, henry, v, died, without, heirs, in, 1125, three, years, after, the, concordat, he, had, designated, his, nephew, frederick, von, staufen, duke, of, swabia, also, known, as, frederick, ii, duke, of, swabia, as, his, successor, instead, churchmen, elected, lothair, iii, a, long, civil, war, erupted, between, the, staufen, also, known, as, hohenstaufen, and, the, heirs, of, lothar, iii, paving, the, way, for, the, rise, to, power, of, the, hohenstaufen, frederick, i, 1152, 1190, at, the, time, of, henry, iv, s, death, henry, i, of, england, and, the, gregorian, papacy, were, also, embroiled, in, a, controversy, over, investiture, and, its, solution, provided, a, model, for, the, eventual, solution, of, the, issue, in, the, empire, william, the, conqueror, had, accepted, a, papal, banner, and, the, distant, blessing, of, pope, alexander, ii, upon, his, invasion, but, had, successfully, rebuffed, the, pope, s, assertion, after, the, successful, outcome, that, he, should, come, to, rome, and, pay, homage, for, his, fief, under, the, general, provisions, of, the, donation, of, constantine, the, ban, on, lay, investiture, in, dictatus, papae, did, not, shake, the, loyalty, of, william, s, bishops, and, abbots, in, the, reign, of, henry, i, the, heat, of, exchanges, between, westminster, and, rome, induced, anselm, archbishop, of, canterbury, to, give, up, mediating, and, retire, to, an, abbey, robert, of, meulan, one, of, henry, s, chief, advisors, was, excommunicated, but, the, threat, of, excommunicating, the, king, remained, unplayed, the, papacy, needed, the, support, of, english, henry, while, german, henry, was, still, unbroken, a, projected, crusade, also, required, english, support, henry, i, commissioned, the, archbishop, of, york, to, collect, and, present, all, the, relevant, traditions, of, anointed, kingship, on, this, topic, the, historian, norman, cantor, would, note, the, resulting, anonymous, of, york, treatises, are, a, delight, to, students, of, early, medieval, political, theory, but, they, in, no, way, typify, the, outlook, of, the, anglo, norman, monarchy, which, had, substituted, the, secure, foundation, of,

that, was, later, taken, up, in, the, concordat, of, worms, in, england, as, in, germany, the, king, s, chancery, started, to, distinguish, between, the, secular, and, ecclesiastical, powers, of, the, prelates, bowing, to, political, reality, and, employing, this, distinction, henry, i, of, england, gave, up, his, right, to, invest, his, bishops, and, abbots, while, reserving, the, custom, of, requiring, them, to, swear, homage, for, the, temporalities, the, landed, properties, tied, to, the, episcopate, directly, from, his, hand, after, the, bishop, had, sworn, homage, and, feudal, vassalage, in, the, commendation, ceremony, commendatio, like, any, secular, vassal, the, system, of, vassalage, was, not, divided, among, great, local, lords, in, england, as, it, was, in, france, since, the, king, was, in, control, by, right, of, the, conquest, henry, i, of, england, perceived, a, danger, in, placing, monastic, scholars, in, his, chancery, and, turned, increasingly, to, secular, clerks, some, of, whom, held, minor, positions, in, the, church, he, often, rewarded, these, men, with, the, titles, of, bishop, and, abbot, henry, i, expanded, the, system, of, scutage, to, reduce, the, monarchy, s, dependence, on, knights, supplied, from, church, lands, unlike, the, situation, in, germany, henry, i, of, england, used, the, investiture, controversy, to, strengthen, the, secular, power, of, the, king, it, would, continue, to, boil, under, the, surface, the, controversy, would, surface, in, the, thomas, becket, affair, under, henry, ii, of, england, the, great,

conflict, on, 23, september, 1122, near, the, german, city, of, worms, pope, callixtus, ii, and, holy, roman, emperor, henry, v, entered, into, an, agreement, now, known, as, the, concordat, of, worms, that, effectively, ended, the, investiture, controversy, it, eliminated, lay, investiture, while, allowing, secular, leaders, some, room, for, unofficial, but, significant, influence, in, the, appointment, process, by, the, terms, of, the, agreement, the, election, of, bishops, and, abbots, in, germany, was, to, take, place, in, the, emperor, s, presence, or, his, legate, s, as, judge, without, violence, between, potentially, disputing, parties, free, of, bribes, thus, retaining, to, the, emperor, a, crucial, role, in, choosing, these, great, territorial, magnates, of, the, empire, but, absent, a, dispute, the, canons, of, the, cathedral, were, to, elect, the, bishop, monks, were, to, choose, the, abbot, beyond, the, borders, of, germany, in, burgundy, and, italy, the, election, would, be, handled, by, the, church, without, imperial, interference, callixtus, reference, to, the, feudal, homage, due, the, emperor, on, appointment, is, guarded, shall, do, unto, thee, for, these, what, he, rightfully, should, was, the, wording, of, the, privilegium, granted, by, callixtus, the, emperor, s, right, to, a, substantial, imbursement, payment, on, the, election, of, a, bishop, or, abbot, was, specifically, denied, the, emperor, renounced, the, right, to, invest, ecclesiastics, with, ring, and, crosier, the, symbols, of, their, spiritual, power, and, guaranteed, election, by, the, canons, of, cathedral, or, abbey, and, free, consecration, to, make, up, for, this, and, symbolise, the, worldly, authority, of, the, bishop, which, the, pope, had, always, recognised, to, derive, from, the, emperor, another, symbol, the, scepter, was, invented, which, would, be, handed, over, by, the, king, or, his, legate, the, two, ended, by, promising, mutual, aid, when, requested, and, by, granting, one, another, peace, the, concordat, was, confirmed, by, the, first, council, of, the, lateran, in, 1123, in, modern, terminology, a, concordat, is, an, international, convention, specifically, one, concluded, between, the, holy, see, and, the, civil, power, of, a, country, to, define, the, relationship, between, the, catholic, church, and, the, state, in, matters, in, which, both, are, concerned, concordats, began, during, the, first, crusade, s, end, in, 1098, the, concordat, of, worms, latin, concordatum, wormatiense, is, sometimes, called, the, pactum, callixtinum, by, papal, historians, since, the, term, concordat, was, not, in, use, until, nicolas, of, cusa, s, de, concordantia, catholica, of, 1434, in, the, long, term, the, decline, of, imperial, power, would, divide, germany, until, the, 19th, century, similarly, in, italy, the, investiture, controversy, weakened, the, emperor, s, authority, and, strengthened, local, separatists, while, the, monarchy, was, embroiled, in, the, dispute, with, the, church, its, power, declined, and, the, localized, rights, of, lordship, over, peasants, increased, which, eventually, led, to, the, papacy, grew, stronger, and, the, laity, became, engaged, in, religious, affairs, increasing, its, piety, and, setting, the, stage, for, the, crusades, and, the, great, religious, vitality, of, the, 12th, century, german, kings, still, had, de, facto, influence, over, the, selection, of, german, bishops, though, over, time, german, princes, gained, influence, among, church, electors, the, bishop, elect, would, then, be, invested, by, the, emperor, or, representative, with, the, scepter, and, sometime, afterwards, by, his, ecclesial, superior, with, ring, and, staff, the, resolution, of, the, controversy,

generally, nominated, more, worthy, candidates, for, the, office, the, concordat, of, worms, did, not, end, the, interference, of, european, monarchs, in, the, selection, of, the, pope, practically,

after, the, concordat, of, worms, in, the, matter, concerning, stephen, langton, in, theory, the, pope, named, his, bishops, and, cardinals, in, reality, more, often, than, not, rome, consecrated, the, clergy, once, it, was, notified, by, the, kings, who, the, incumbent, would, be, recalcitrance, by, rome, would, lead, to, problems, in, the, kingdom, for, the, most, part, it, was, a, no, win, situation, for, rome, in, this, the, concordat, of, worms, changed, little, the, growth, of, canon, law, in, the, ecclesiastical, courts, was, based, on, the, underlying, roman, law, and, increased, the, strength, of, the, roman, pontiff, disputes, between, popes, and, holy, roman, emperors, continued, until, northern, italy, was, lost, to, the, empire, entirely, after, the, wars, of, the, guelphs, and, ghibellines, emperor, otto, iv, marched, on, rome, and, commanded, pope, innocent, iii, to, annul, the, concordat, of, worms, and, to, recognise, the, imperial, crown, s, right, to,

shattered, the, early, medieval, equilibrium, and, ended, the, interpenetration, of, ecclesia, and, mundus, indeed, medieval, emperors, which, were, largely, the, creation, of, ecclesiastical, ideals, and, personnel, were, forced, to, develop, a, secular, bureaucratic, state, whose, essential, components, persisted, in, the, anglo, norman, monarchy, kings, continued, to, attempt, to, control, either, the, direct, leadership, of, the, church, or, indirectly, through, political, means, for, centuries, this, is, seen, most, clearly, in, the, avignon, papacy, when, the, popes, moved, from, rome, to, avignon, the, conflict, in, germany, and, northern, italy, arguably, left, the, culture, ripe, for, various, protestant, sects, such, as, the, cathars, the, waldensians, and, ultimately, jan, hus, and, martin, luther, though, the, holy, roman, emperor, retained, some, power, over, imperial, churches, his, power, was, damaged, irreparably, because, he, lost, the, religious, authority, that, previously, belonged, to, the, office, of, the, king, in, france, england, and, the, christian, state, in, spain, the, king, could, overcome, rebellions, of, his, magnates, and, establish, the, power, of, his, royal, demesne, because, he, could, rely, on, the, church, which, for, several, centuries, had, given, him, a, mystical, authority, from, time, to, time, rebellious, and, recalcitrant, monarchs, might, run, afoul, of, the, church, these, could, be, excommunicated, and, after, an, appropriate, time, and, public, penance, be, received, back, into, the, communion, and, good, graces, of, the, church, of, the, three, reforms, gregory, vii, and, his, predecessors, and, successor, popes, had, attempted, the, most, successful, had, been, that, in, regard, to, celibacy, of, the, clergy, simony, had, been, partially, checked, against, lay, investiture, they, won, only, a, limited, success, and, one, that, seemed, less, impressive, as, the, years, passed, during, the, time, following, the, concordat, of, worms, the, church, gained, in, both, stature, and, power, the, wording, of, the, concordat, of, worms, was, ambiguous, skirted, some, issues, and, avoided, others, altogether, this, has, caused, some, scholars, to, conclude, that, the, settlement, turned, its, back, on, gregory, vii, s, and, urban, ii, s, genuine, hopes, for, reform, the, emperor, s, influence, in, episcopal, matters, was, preserved, and, he, could, decide, disputed, elections, if, the, compromise, was, a, rebuke, to, the, most, radical, vision, of, the, liberty, of, the, church, on, at, least, one, point, its, implication, was, firm, and, unmistakable, the, king, even, an, emperor, was, a, layman, and, his, power, at, least, morally, limited, hence, totalitarianism, was, unacceptable, according, to, the, opinion, of, w, jordan, the, divine, right, of, kings, was, dealt, a, blow, from, which, it, never, completely, recovered, yet, unfettered, authority, and, caesaropapism, was, not, something, the, later, mediaevals, and, early, moderns, understood, by, the, phrase, by, the, grace, of, god, which, many, of, them, ardently, defended, if, anything, a, blow, was, dealt, to, subconsciously, remaining, pre, christian, germanic, feelings, of, royal, hail, it, was, the, consequence, of, this, lengthy, episode, that, a, whole, generation, grew, up, in, germany, and, northern, italy, in, an, atmosphere, of, war, doubt, and, scepticism, the, papal, backers, had, been, busy, propounding, arguments, to, show, that, royal, power, was, not, of, divine, origin, they, had, been, so, successful, that, the, moral, authority, of, the, emperor, had, been, undermined, in, the, minds, of, many, of, his, subjects, serious, divisions, existed, from, this, battle, over, the, investiture, controversy, which, fractured, large, portions, of, the, holy, roman, empire, in, germany, and, italy, davis, argues, these, rifts, were, so, deep, and, lasting, that, neither, germany, nor, italy, were, able, to, form, a, cohesive, nation, state, until, the, 19th, century, a, similar, situation, arose, from, the, french, revolution, which, caused, fractures, in, france, that, still, exist, the, effect, of, henry, iv, s, excommunication, and, his, subsequent, refusal, to, repent, left, a, turbulence, in, central, europe, that, lasted, throughout, the, middle, ages, it, may, have, been, emblematic, of, certain, german, attitudes, toward, religion, in, general, and, the, perceived, relevance, of, the, german, emperor, in, the, universal, scheme, of, things, the, catastrophic, political, consequences, of, the, struggle, between, pope, and, emperor, also, led, to, a, cultural, disaster, germany, lost, intellectual, leadership, in, western, europe, in, 1050, german, monasteries, were, great, centres, of, learning, and, art, and, german, schools, of, theology, and, canon, law, were, unsurpassed, and, probably, unmatched, anywhere, in, europe, the, long, war, over, investiture, sapped, the, energy, of, both, german, churchmen, and, intellectuals, they, fell, behind, advances, in, philosophy, law, literature, and, art, taking, place, in, france, and, italy, in, many, ways, germany, never, caught, up, during, the, rest, of, the, middle, ages, universities, were, established, in, france, italy, spain, and, england, by, the, early, 13th, century, notable, are, the, university, of, bologna, 1088, oxford, university, 1096, the, university, of, salamanca, 1134, the, university, of, paris, 1150, and, the, university, of, cambridge, 1207, the, first, german, university, the, heidelberg, university, was, not, established, until, 1386, it, was, immediately, steeped, in, mediaeval, nominalism, and, early, protestantism, the, political, scientist, bruce, bueno, de, mesquita, argues, that, the, concordat, of, worms, contained, within, itself, the, germ, of, nation, based, sovereignty, that, would, one, day, be, confirmed, in, the, peace, of, westphalia, 1648, the, concordat, of, worms, created, an, incentive, structure, for, the, rulers, of, the, catholic, parts, of, europe, such, that, in, the, northern, regions, local, rulers, were, motivated, to, raise, the, prosperity, and, liberty, of, their, subjects, because, such, reforms, helped, those, rulers, assert, their, independence, from, the, pope, with, the, concordat, of, worms, the, pope, became, the, de, facto, selector, of, bishops, as, his, recommendations, all, but, guaranteed, a, candidate, s, nomination, instead, of, myriad, local, customs, it, all, came, down, to, negotiations, between, the, pope, and, the, local, secular, ruler, therefore, the, influence, of, the, pope, in, the, region, became, the, common, deciding, factor, across, the, catholic, parts, of, europe, as, a, consequence, of, the, concordat, if, the, local, ruler, rejected, the, pope, s, nominee, for, bishop, the, ruler, could, keep, the, revenue, of, the, diocese, for, himself, but, the, pope, could, retaliate, in, various, ways, such, as, ordering, the, local, priests, to, not, perform, certain, sacraments, such, as, marriages, which, would, annoy, the, ruler, s, subjects, forgiving, oaths, made, by, the, vassals, to, the, ruler, and, even, excommunicating, the, ruler, thereby, undermining, his, moral, legitimacy, eventually, the, ruler, would, have, to, give, in, to, the, pope, and, accept, a, bishop, the, longer, a, local, ruler, could, hold, out, against, the, pope, the, more, leverage, the, ruler, had, to, demand, a, bishop, who, suited, his, interests, in, a, region, where, the, pope, s, influence, was, weak, the, local, priests, might, have, performed, sacraments, anyway, having, calculated, that, defying, the, pope, was, not, as, dangerous, as, angering, their, parishioners, the, ruler, s, vassals, might, have, honored, their, oaths, anyway, because, the, pope, could, not, protect, them, from, their, lord, s, wrath, and, the, subjects, might, still, have, respected, their, ruler, despite, excommunication, if, the, pope, s, influence, in, a, diocese, was, weak, the, local, ruler, could, force, the, pope, to, choose, between, getting, the, tax, revenue, and, appointing, a, loyal, bishop, if, said, diocese, was, relatively, poor, the, pope, would, stubbornly, hold, out, until, the, local, ruler, accepted, the, pope, s, choice, of, bishop, during, this, standoff, the, pope, would, not, get, any, money, from, the, diocese, but, this, was, fine, with, him, because, the, diocese, didn, t, yield, much, money, anyway, but, if, said, diocese, was, prosperous, the, pope, wanted, to, resolve, the, dispute, more, quickly, so, that, he, could, sooner, get, that, ample, revenue, flowing, into, his, coffers, and, so, he, was, more, inclined, to, let, the, local, ruler, pick, the, bishop, a, local, secular, ruler, could, stimulate, the, economy, of, his, domain, and, thereby, collect, more, tax, revenue, by, giving, his, subjects, more, liberty, and, more, participation, in, politics, the, local, ruler, was, required, to, raise, enough, tax, revenue, so, that, he, could, provide, sufficient, rewards, to, his, essential, supporters, in, order, to, secure, their, loyalty, but, liberalization, and, democratization, would, also, make, his, subjects, more, assertive, which, in, itself, made, the, ruler, s, hold, on, power, less, secure, generally, a, shrewd, ruler, would, permit, his, people, just, enough, liberty, that, he, could, raise, sufficient, tax, revenue, to, provide, his, essential, supporters, with, just, enough, rewards, to, keep, them, loyal, see, selectorate, theory, for, a, thorough, explanation, of, these, trade, offs, in, this, specific, context, the, ruler, of, a, diocese, also, had, to, consider, whether, to, raise, additional, money, by, risking, liberalization, to, convince, the, pope, to, compromise, on, the, choice, of, bishop, under, this, incentive, structure, if, the, pope, s, influence, in, a, region, was, strong, the, local, ruler, would, see, little, point, in, liberalizing, his, state, he, would, raise, more, tax, revenue, but, it, would, not, be, enough, to, get, out, from, under, the, pope, s, thumb, which, was, just, too, strong, liberalization, would, make, his, people, more, assertive, and, the, pope, would, incite, them, to, revolt, the, pope, would, get, both, the, money, and, his, choice, of, bishop, thus, the, local, ruler, decided, that, oppressing, his, people, was, the, sounder, strategy, for, political, survival, on, the, other, hand, if, the, pope, s, influence, in, the, region, was, weak, the, local, ruler, calculated, that, liberalizing, his, state, thereby, making, it, more, prosperous, could, give, him, enough, leverage, to, get, his, choice, of, bishop, the, pope, would, try, to, incite, the, people, to, revolt, but, to, weak, effect, thus, the, local, ruler, could, hold, out, for, longer, against, the, pope, and, the, pope, would, concede, the, local, ruler, would, get, his, preferred, bishop, and, the, pope, would, get, the, money, in, the, catholic, regions, of, europe, the, pope, s, influence, was, weaker, the, further, away, a, region, was, from, rome, because, in, general, it, is, difficult, to, project, power, over, long, distances, and, across, difficult, terrain, such, as, mountains, this, bueno, de, mesquita, argues, is, why, the, northern, regions, of, europe, such, as, england, and, the, netherlands, became, more, prosperous, and, free, than, the, southern, regions, he, further, argues, that, this, dynamic, is, what, enabled, the, protestant, reformation, which, mostly, happened, in, northern, europe, the, northern, parts, of, europe, were, so, prosperous, and, the, influence, of, the, pope, there, was, so, weak, their, local, rulers, could, reject, the, pope, s, bishops, indefinitely
