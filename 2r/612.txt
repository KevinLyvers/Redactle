tikal, t, i, k, l, tik, al, in, modern, mayan, orthography, is, the, ruin, of, an, ancient, city, which, was, likely, to, have, been, called, yax, mutal, found, in, a, rainforest, in, guatemala, it, is, one, of, the, largest, archeological, sites, and, urban, centers, of, the, pre, columbian, maya, civilization, it, is, located, in, the, archeological, region, of, the, pet, n, basin, in, what, is, now, northern, guatemala, situated, in, the, department, of, el, pet, n, the, site, is, part, of, guatemala, s, tikal, national, park, and, in, 1979, it, was, declared, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, tikal, was, the, capital, of, a, conquest, state, that, became, one, of, the, most, powerful, kingdoms, of, the, ancient, maya, though, monumental, architecture, at, the, site, dates, back, as, far, as, the, 4th, century, bc, tikal, reached, its, apogee, during, the, classic, period, c, 200, to, 900, during, this, time, the, city, dominated, much, of, the, maya, region, politically, economically, and, militarily, while, interacting, with, areas, throughout, mesoamerica, such, as, the, great, metropolis, of, teotihuacan, in, the, distant, valley, of, mexico, there, is, evidence, that, one, of, tikal, s, great, ruling, dynasties, was, founded, by, conquerors, from, teotihuacan, in, the, 4th, century, ad, following, the, end, of, the, late, classic, period, no, new, major, monuments, were, built, at, tikal, and, there, is, evidence, that, elite, palaces, were, burned, these, events, were, coupled, with, a, gradual, population, decline, culminating, with, the, site, s, abandonment, by, the, end, of, the, 10th, century, tikal, is, the, best, understood, of, any, of, the, large, lowland, maya, cities, with, a, long, dynastic, ruler, list, the, discovery, of, the, tombs, of, many, of, the, rulers, on, this, list, and, the, investigation, of, their, monuments, temples, and, palaces, the, name, tikal, may, be, derived, from, ti, ak, al, in, the, yucatec, maya, language, it, is, said, to, be, a, relatively, modern, name, meaning, at, the, waterhole, the, name, was, apparently, applied, to, one, of, the, site, s, ancient, reservoirs, by, hunters, and, travelers, in, the, region, it, has, alternatively, been, interpreted, as, meaning, the, place, of, the, voices, in, the, itza, maya, language, tikal, however, is, not, the, ancient, name, for, the, site, but, rather, the, name, adopted, shortly, after, its, discovery, in, the, 1840s, hieroglyphic, inscriptions, at, the, ruins, refer, to, the, ancient, city, as, yax, mutal, or, yax, mutul, meaning, first, mutal, tikal, may, have, come, to, have, been, called, this, because, dos, pilas, also, came, to, use, the, same, emblem, glyph, the, rulers, of, the, city, presumably, wanted, to, distinguish, themselves, as, the, first, city, to, bear, the, name, the, kingdom, as, a, whole, was, simply, called, mutul, which, is, the, reading, of, the, hair, bundle, emblem, glyph, seen, in, the, accompanying, photo, its, precise, meaning, remains, obscure, the, closest, large, modern, settlements, are, flores, and, santa, elena, approximately, 64, kilometers, 40, mi, by, road, to, the, southwest, tikal, is, approximately, 303, kilometers, 188, mi, north, of, guatemala, city, it, is, 19, kilometers, 12, mi, south, of, the, contemporary, maya, city, of, uaxactun, and, 30, kilometers, 19, mi, northwest, of, yaxha, the, city, was, located, 100, kilometers, 62, mi, southeast, of, its, great, classic, period, rival, calakmul, and, 85, kilometers, 53, mi, northwest, of, calakmul, s, ally, caracol, now, in, belize, the, city, has, been, completely, mapped, and, covered, an, area, greater, than, 16, square, kilometers, 6, 2, sq, mi, that, included, about, 3, 000, structures, the, topography, of, the, site, consists, of, a, series, of, parallel, limestone, ridges, rising, above, swampy, lowlands, the, major, architecture, of, the, site, is, clustered, upon, areas, of, higher, ground, and, linked, by, raised, causeways, spanning, the, swamps, the, area, around, tikal, has, been, declared, as, the, tikal, national, park, and, the, preserved, area, covers, 570, square, kilometers, 220, sq, mi, it, was, created, on, 26, may, 1568, under, the, auspices, of, the, instituto, de, antropolog, a, e, historia, and, was, the, first, protected, area, in, guatemala, the, ruins, lie, among, the, tropical, rainforests, of, northern, guatemala, that, formed, the, cradle, of, lowland, maya, civilization, the, city, itself, was, located, among, abundant, fertile, upland, soils, and, may, have, dominated, a, natural, east, west, trade, route, across, the, yucatan, peninsula, conspicuous, trees, at, the, tikal, park, include, gigantic, kapok, tree, ceiba, pentandra, the, sacred, tree, of, the, maya, tropical, cedar, cedrela, odorata, and, honduras, mahogany, swietenia, macrophylla, regarding, the, fauna, agoutis, white, nosed, coatis, gray, foxes, geoffroy, s, spider, monkeys, howler, monkeys, harpy, eagles, falcons, ocellated, turkeys, guans, toucans, green, parrots, and, leafcutter, ants, can, be, seen, there, regularly, jaguars, ocelots, and, cougars, are, also, said, to, roam, in, the, park, tikal, had, no, water, other, than, what, was, collected, from, rainwater, and, stored, in, ten, reservoirs, archeologists, working, in, tikal, during, the, 20th, century, refurbished, one, of, these, ancient, reservoirs, to, store, water, for, their, own, use, the, average, annual, rainfall, at, tikal, is, 1, 945, millimeters, 76, 6, in, however, the, arrival, of, rain, was, often, unpredictable, and, long, periods, of, drought, could, occur, before, the, crops, ripened, which, severely, threatened, the, inhabitants, of, the, city, population, estimates, for, tikal, vary, from, 10, 000, to, as, high, as, 90, 000, inhabitants, the, population, of, tikal, began, a, continuous, curve, of, growth, starting, in, the, preclassic, period, approximately, 2000, bc, ad, 200, with, a, peak, in, the, late, classic, with, the, population, growing, rapidly, from, ad, 700, through, to, 830, followed, by, a, sharp, decline, for, the, 120, square, kilometers, 46, sq, mi, area, falling, within, the, earthwork, defenses, of, the, hinterland, the, peak, population, is, estimated, at, 517, per, square, kilometer, 1340, per, square, mile, in, an, area, within, a, 12, kilometers, 7, 5, mi, radius, of, the, site, core, peak, population, is, estimated, at, 120, 000, population, density, is, estimated, at, 265, per, square, kilometer, 689, per, square, mile, in, a, region, within, a, 25, kilometers, 16, mi, radius, of, the, site, core, and, including, some, satellite, sites, peak, population, is, estimated, at, 425, 000, with, a, density, of, 216, per, square, kilometer, 515, per, square, mile, these, population, figures, are, even, more, impressive, because, of, the, extensive, swamplands, that, were, unsuitable, for, habitation, or, agriculture, however, some, archeologists, such, as, david, webster, believe, these, figures, to, be, far, too, high, there, are, traces, of, early, agriculture, at, the, site, dating, as, far, back, as, 1000, bc, in, the, middle, preclassic, a, cache, of, mamon, ceramics, dating, from, about, 700, 400, bc, were, found, in, a, sealed, chultun, a, subterranean, bottle, shaped, chamber, major, construction, at, tikal, was, already, taking, place, in, the, late, preclassic, period, first, appearing, around, 400, 300, bc, including, the, building, of, major, pyramids, and, platforms, although, the, city, was, still, dwarfed, by, sites, further, north, such, as, el, mirador, and, nakbe, at, this, time, tikal, participated, in, the, widespread, chikanel, culture, that, dominated, the, central, and, northern, maya, areas, at, this, time, a, region, that, included, the, entire, yucatan, peninsula, including, northern, and, eastern, guatemala, and, all, of, belize, two, temples, dating, to, late, chikanel, times, had, masonry, walled, superstructures, that, may, have, been, corbel, vaulted, although, this, has, not, been, proven, one, of, these, had, elaborate, paintings, on, the, outer, walls, showing, human, figures, against, a, scrollwork, background, painted, in, yellow, black, pink, and, red, in, the, 1st, century, ad, rich, burials, first, appeared, and, tikal, underwent, a, political, and, cultural, florescence, as, its, giant, northern, neighbors, declined, at, the, end, of, the, late, preclassic, the, izapan, style, art, and, architecture, from, the, pacific, coast, began, to, influence, tikal, as, demonstrated, by, a, broken, sculpture, from, the, acropolis, and, early, murals, at, the, city, dynastic, rulership, among, the, lowland, maya, is, most, deeply, rooted, at, tikal, according, to, later, hieroglyphic, records, the, dynasty, was, founded, by, yax, ehb, xook, perhaps, in, the, 1st, century, ad, at, the, beginning, of, the, early, classic, power, in, the, maya, region, was, concentrated, at, tikal, and, calakmul, in, the, core, of, the, maya, heartland, tikal, may, have, benefited, from, the, collapse, of, the, large, preclassic, states, such, as, el, mirador, in, the, early, classic, tikal, rapidly, developed, into, the, most, dynamic, city, in, the, maya, region, stimulating, the, development, of, other, nearby, maya, cities, the, site, however, was, often, at, war, and, inscriptions, tell, of, alliances, and, conflict, with, other, maya, states, including, uaxactun, caracol, naranjo, and, calakmul, the, site, was, defeated, at, the, end, of, the, early, classic, by, caracol, which, rose, to, take, tikal, s, place, as, the, paramount, center, in, the, southern, maya, lowlands, the, earlier, part, of, the, early, classic, saw, hostilities, between, tikal, and, its, neighbor, uaxactun, with, uaxactun, recording, the, capture, of, prisoners, from, tikal, there, appears, to, have, been, a, breakdown, in, the, male, succession, by, ad, 317, when, lady, unen, bahlam, conducted, a, katun, ending, ceremony, apparently, as, queen, of, the, city, as, early, as, 200, ad, teotihuacan, had, embassies, in, tikal, the, fourteenth, king, of, tikal, was, chak, tok, ich, aak, great, jaguar, paw, chak, tok, ich, aak, built, a, palace, that, was, preserved, and, developed, by, later, rulers, until, it, became, the, core, of, the, central, acropolis, little, is, known, about, chak, tok, ich, aak, except, that, he, was, killed, on, 14, january, 378, ad, on, the, same, day, siyah, k, ak, fire, is, born, arrived, from, the, west, having, passed, through, el, peru, a, site, to, the, west, of, tikal, on, 8, january, on, stela, 31, he, is, named, as, lord, of, the, west, siyah, k, ak, was, probably, a, foreign, general, serving, a, figure, represented, by, a, non, maya, hieroglyph, of, a, spearthrower, combined, with, an, owl, a, glyph, that, is, well, known, from, the, great, metropolis, of, teotihuacan, in, the, distant, valley, of, mexico, spearthrower, owl, may, even, have, been, the, ruler, of, teotihuacan, these, recorded, events, strongly, suggest, that, siyah, k, ak, led, a, teotihuacan, invasion, that, defeated, the, native, tikal, king, who, was, captured, and, immediately, executed, siyah, k, ak, appears, to, have, been, aided, by, a, powerful, political, faction, at, tikal, itself, roughly, at, the, time, of, the, conquest, a, group, of, teotihuacan, natives, were, apparently, residing, near, the, lost, world, complex, he, also, exerted, control, over, other, cities, in, the, area, including, uaxactun, where, he, became, king, but, did, not, take, the, throne, of, tikal, for, himself, within, a, year, the, son, of, spearthrower, owl, by, the, name, of, yax, nuun, ayiin, i, first, crocodile, had, been, installed, as, the, fifteenth, king, of, tikal, while, he, was, still, a, boy, being, enthroned, on, 13, september, 379, he, reigned, for, 47, years, as, king, of, tikal, and, remained, a, vassal, of, siyah, k, ak, for, as, long, as, the, latter, lived, it, seems, likely, that, yax, nuun, ayiin, i, took, a, wife, from, the, preexisting, defeated, tikal, dynasty, and, thus, legitimized, the, right, to, rule, of, his, son, siyaj, chan, k, awiil, ii, r, o, azul, a, small, site, 100, kilometers, 62, mi, northeast, of, tikal, was, conquered, by, the, latter, during, the, reign, of, yax, nuun, ayiin, i, the, site, became, an, outpost, of, tikal, shielding, it, from, hostile, cities, further, north, and, also, became, a, trade, link, to, the, caribbean, although, the, new, rulers, of, tikal, were, foreign, their, descendants, were, rapidly, mayanized, tikal, became, the, key, ally, and, trading, partner, of, teotihuacan, in, the, maya, lowlands, after, being, conquered, by, teotihuacan, tikal, rapidly, dominated, the, northern, and, eastern, peten, uaxactun, together, with, smaller, towns, in, the, region, were, absorbed, into, tikal, s, kingdom, other, sites, such, as, bejucal, and, motul, de, san, jos, near, lake, pet, n, itz, became, vassals, of, their, more, powerful, neighbor, to, the, north, by, the, middle, of, the, 5th, century, tikal, had, a, core, territory, of, at, least, 25, kilometers, 16, mi, in, every, direction, around, the, 5th, century, an, impressive, system, of, fortifications, consisting, of, ditches, and, earthworks, was, built, along, the, northern, periphery, of, tikal, s, hinterland, joining, up, with, the, natural, defenses, provided, by, large, areas, of, swampland, lying, to, the, east, and, west, of, the, city, additional, fortifications, were, probably, also, built, to, the, south, these, defenses, protected, tikal, s, core, population, and, agricultural, resources, encircling, an, area, of, approximately, 120, square, kilometers, 46, sq, mi, recent, research, suggests, that, the, earthworks, served, as, a, water, collection, system, rather, than, a, defensive, purpose, in, the, 5th, century, the, power, of, the, city, reached, as, far, south, as, cop, n, whose, founder, k, inich, yax, k, uk, mo, was, clearly, connected, with, tikal, cop, n, itself, was, not, in, an, ethnically, maya, region, and, the, founding, of, the, cop, n, dynasty, probably, involved, the, direct, intervention, of, tikal, k, inich, yax, k, uk, mo, arrived, in, cop, n, in, december, 426, and, bone, analysis, of, his, remains, shows, that, he, passed, his, childhood, and, youth, at, tikal, an, individual, known, as, ajaw, k, uk, mo, lord, k, uk, mo, is, referred, to, in, an, early, text, at, tikal, and, may, well, be, the, same, person, his, tomb, had, teotihuacan, characteristics, and, he, was, depicted, in, later, portraits, dressed, in, the, warrior, garb, of, teotihuacan, hieroglyphic, texts, refer, to, him, as, lord, of, the, west, much, like, siyah, k, ak, at, the, same, time, in, late, 426, cop, n, founded, the, nearby, site, of, quirigu, possibly, sponsored, by, tikal, itself, the, founding, of, these, two, centers, may, have, been, part, of, an, effort, to, impose, tikal, s, authority, upon, the, southeastern, portion, of, the, maya, region, the, interaction, between, these, sites, and, tikal, was, intense, over, the, next, three, centuries, a, long, running, rivalry, between, tikal, and, calakmul, began, in, the, 6th, century, with, each, of, the, two, cities, forming, its, own, network, of, mutually, hostile, alliances, arrayed, against, each, other, in, what, has, been, likened, to, a, long, running, war, between, two, maya, superpowers, the, kings, of, these, two, capitals, adopted, the, title, kaloomte, a, term, that, has, not, been, precisely, translated, but, that, implies, something, akin, to, high, king, the, early, 6th, century, saw, another, queen, ruling, the, city, known, only, as, the, lady, of, tikal, who, was, very, likely, a, daughter, of, chak, tok, ich, aak, ii, she, seems, never, to, have, ruled, in, her, own, right, rather, being, partnered, with, male, co, rulers, the, first, of, these, was, kaloomte, b, alam, who, seems, to, have, had, a, long, career, as, a, general, at, tikal, before, becoming, co, ruler, and, 19th, in, the, dynastic, sequence, the, lady, of, tikal, herself, seems, not, have, been, counted, in, the, dynastic, numbering, it, appears, she, was, later, paired, with, lord, bird, claw, who, is, presumed, to, be, the, otherwise, unknown, 20th, ruler, in, the, mid, 6th, century, caracol, seems, to, have, allied, with, calakmul, and, defeated, tikal, closing, the, early, classic, the, tikal, hiatus, refers, to, a, period, between, the, late, 6th, to, late, 7th, century, where, there, was, a, lapse, in, the, writing, of, inscriptions, and, large, scale, construction, at, tikal, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 6th, century, ad, a, serious, crisis, befell, the, city, with, no, new, stelae, being, erected, and, with, widespread, deliberate, mutilation, of, public, sculpture, this, hiatus, in, activity, at, tikal, was, long, unexplained, until, later, epigraphic, decipherments, identified, that, the, period, was, prompted, by, tikal, s, comprehensive, defeat, at, the, hands, of, calakmul, and, the, caracol, polity, in, ad, 562, a, defeat, that, seems, to, have, resulted, in, the, capture, and, sacrifice, of, the, king, of, tikal, the, badly, eroded, altar, 21, at, caracol, described, how, tikal, suffered, this, disastrous, defeat, in, a, major, war, in, april, 562, it, seems, that, caracol, was, an, ally, of, calakmul, in, the, wider, conflict, between, that, city, and, tikal, with, the, defeat, of, tikal, having, a, lasting, impact, upon, the, city, tikal, was, not, sacked, but, its, power, and, influence, were, broken, after, its, great, victory, caracol, grew, rapidly, and, some, of, tikal, s, population, may, have, been, forcibly, relocated, there, during, the, hiatus, period, at, least, one, ruler, of, tikal, took, refuge, with, janaab, pakal, of, palenque, another, of, calakmul, s, victims, calakmul, itself, thrived, during, tikal, s, long, hiatus, period, the, beginning, of, the, tikal, hiatus, has, served, as, a, marker, by, which, archeologists, commonly, subdivide, the, classic, period, of, mesoamerican, chronology, into, the, early, and, late, classic, in, 629, tikal, founded, dos, pilas, some, 110, kilometers, 68, mi, to, the, southwest, as, a, military, outpost, in, order, to, control, trade, along, the, course, of, the, pasi, n, river, b, alaj, chan, k, awiil, was, installed, on, the, throne, of, the, new, outpost, at, the, age, of, four, in, 635, when, he, was, older, for, many, years, he, served, as, a, loyal, vassal, fighting, for, his, brother, the, king, of, tikal, roughly, twenty, years, later, dos, pilas, was, attacked, by, calakmul, and, was, soundly, defeated, b, alaj, chan, k, awiil, was, captured, by, the, king, of, calakmul, but, instead, of, being, sacrificed, he, was, re, instated, on, his, throne, as, a, vassal, of, his, former, enemy, he, attacked, tikal, in, 657, forcing, nuun, ujol, chaak, then, king, of, tikal, to, temporarily, abandon, the, city, the, first, two, rulers, of, dos, pilas, continued, to, use, the, mutal, emblem, glyph, of, tikal, and, they, probably, felt, that, they, had, a, legitimate, claim, to, the, throne, of, tikal, itself, for, some, reason, b, alaj, chan, k, awiil, was, not, installed, as, the, new, ruler, of, tikal, instead, he, stayed, at, dos, pilas, tikal, counterattacked, against, dos, pilas, in, 672, driving, b, alaj, chan, k, awiil, into, an, exile, that, lasted, five, years, calakmul, tried, to, encircle, tikal, within, an, area, dominated, by, its, allies, such, as, el, peru, dos, pilas, and, caracol, in, 682, jasaw, chan, k, awiil, i, erected, the, first, dated, monument, at, tikal, in, 120, years, and, claimed, the, title, of, kaloomte, so, ending, the, hiatus, he, initiated, a, program, of, new, construction, and, turned, the, tables, on, calakmul, when, in, 695, he, captured, the, enemy, noble, and, threw, the, enemy, state, into, a, long, decline, from, which, it, never, fully, recovered, after, this, calakmul, never, again, erected, a, monument, celebrating, a, military, victory, by, the, 7th, century, there, was, no, active, teotihuacan, presence, at, any, maya, site, and, the, center, of, teotihuacan, had, been, razed, by, 700, even, after, this, formal, war, attire, illustrated, on, monuments, was, teotihuacan, style, jasaw, chan, k, awiil, i, and, his, heir, yik, in, chan, k, awiil, continued, hostilities, against, calakmul, and, its, allies, and, imposed, firm, regional, control, over, the, area, around, tikal, extending, as, far, as, the, territory, around, lake, pet, n, itz, these, two, rulers, were, responsible, for, much, of, the, impressive, architecture, visible, today, in, 738, quirigu, a, vassal, of, cop, n, tikal, s, key, ally, in, the, south, switched, allegiance, to, calakmul, defeated, cop, n, and, gained, its, own, independence, it, appears, that, this, was, a, conscious, effort, on, the, part, of, calakmul, to, bring, about, the, collapse, of, tikal, s, southern, allies, this, upset, the, balance, of, power, in, the, southern, maya, area, and, lead, to, a, steady, decline, in, the, fortunes, of, cop, n, in, the, 8th, century, the, rulers, of, tikal, collected, monuments, from, across, the, city, and, erected, them, in, front, of, the, north, acropolis, by, the, late, 8th, century, and, early, 9th, century, activity, at, tikal, slowed, impressive, architecture, was, still, built, but, few, hieroglyphic, inscriptions, refer, to, later, rulers, by, the, 9th, century, the, crisis, of, the, classic, maya, collapse, was, sweeping, across, the, region, with, populations, plummeting, and, city, after, city, falling, into, silence, increasingly, endemic, warfare, in, the, maya, region, caused, tikal, s, supporting, population, to, heavily, concentrate, close, to, the, city, itself, accelerating, the, use, of, intensive, agriculture, and, the, corresponding, environmental, decline, construction, continued, at, the, beginning, of, the, century, with, the, erection, of, temple, 3, the, last, of, the, city, s, major, pyramids, and, the, erection, of, monuments, to, mark, the, 19th, k, atun, in, 810, the, beginning, of, the, 10th, bak, tun, in, 830, passed, uncelebrated, and, marks, the, beginning, of, a, 60, year, hiatus, probably, resulting, from, the, collapse, of, central, control, in, the, city, during, this, hiatus, satellite, sites, traditionally, under, tikal, s, control, began, to, erect, their, own, monuments, featuring, local, rulers, and, using, the, mutal, emblem, glyph, with, tikal, apparently, lacking, the, authority, or, the, power, to, crush, these, bids, for, independence, in, 849, jewel, k, awiil, is, mentioned, on, a, stela, at, seibal, as, visiting, that, city, as, the, divine, lord, of, tikal, but, he, is, not, recorded, elsewhere, and, tikal, s, once, great, power, was, little, more, than, a, memory, the, sites, of, ixlu, and, jimbal, had, by, now, inherited, the, once, exclusive, mutal, emblem, glyph, as, tikal, and, its, hinterland, reached, peak, population, the, area, suffered, deforestation, erosion, and, nutrient, loss, followed, by, a, rapid, decline, in, population, levels, recent, analysis, also, indicates, that, the, city, s, freshwater, sources, became, highly, contaminated, with, mercury, phosphate, and, cyanobacteria, leading, to, the, accumulation, of, toxins, tikal, and, its, immediate, surroundings, seem, to, have, lost, most, of, their, population, between, 830, and, 950, and, central, authority, seems, to, have, collapsed, rapidly, there, is, not, much, evidence, from, tikal, that, the, city, was, directly, affected, by, the, endemic, warfare, that, afflicted, parts, of, the, maya, region, during, the, terminal, classic, although, an, influx, of, refugees, from, the, petexbat, n, region, may, have, exacerbated, problems, resulting, from, the, already, stretched, environmental, resources, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 9th, century, there, was, an, attempt, to, revive, royal, power, at, the, much, diminished, city, of, tikal, as, evidenced, by, a, stela, erected, in, the, great, plaza, by, jasaw, chan, k, awiil, ii, in, 869, this, was, the, last, monument, erected, at, tikal, before, the, city, finally, fell, into, silence, the, former, satellites, of, tikal, such, as, jimbal, and, uaxactun, did, not, last, much, longer, erecting, their, final, monuments, in, 889, by, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, the, vast, majority, of, tikal, s, population, had, deserted, the, city, its, royal, palaces, were, occupied, by, squatters, and, simple, thatched, dwellings, were, being, erected, in, the, city, s, ceremonial, plazas, the, squatters, blocked, some, doorways, in, the, rooms, they, reoccupied, in, the, monumental, structures, of, the, site, and, left, rubbish, that, included, a, mixture, of, domestic, refuse, and, non, utilitarian, items, such, as, musical, instruments, these, inhabitants, reused, the, earlier, monuments, for, their, own, ritual, activities, far, removed, from, those, of, the, royal, dynasty, that, had, erected, them, some, monuments, were, vandalized, and, some, were, moved, to, new, locations, before, its, final, abandonment, all, respect, for, the, old, rulers, had, disappeared, with, the, tombs, of, the, north, acropolis, being, explored, for, jade, and, the, easier, to, find, tombs, were, looted, after, 950, tikal, was, all, but, deserted, although, a, remnant, population, may, have, survived, in, perishable, huts, interspersed, among, the, ruins, even, these, final, inhabitants, abandoned, the, city, in, the, 10th, or, 11th, centuries, and, the, rainforest, claimed, the, ruins, for, the, next, thousand, years, some, of, tikal, s, population, may, have, migrated, to, the, peten, lakes, region, which, remained, heavily, populated, in, spite, of, a, plunge, in, population, levels, in, the, first, half, of, the, 9th, century, the, most, likely, cause, of, collapse, at, tikal, is, overpopulation, and, agrarian, failure, the, fall, of, tikal, was, a, blow, to, the, heart, of, classic, maya, civilization, the, city, having, been, at, the, forefront, of, courtly, life, art, and, architecture, for, over, a, thousand, years, with, an, ancient, ruling, dynasty, however, new, research, regarding, paleoenvironmental, proxies, from, the, tikal, reservoir, system, suggests, that, a, meteorological, drought, may, have, led, to, the, abandonment, of, tikal, fouling, some, reservoirs, near, the, temple, and, palace, with, algae, blooms, while, other, reservoirs, remained, drinkable, buildings, were, painted, with, mercury, bearing, cinnabar, which, were, washed, off, by, rain, and, polluted, some, reservoirs, works, of, kohler, and, colleagues, showed, that, this, city, reached, an, unsustainable, level, of, inequalities, at, the, end, in, 1525, the, spanish, conquistador, hern, n, cort, s, passed, within, a, few, kilometers, of, the, ruins, of, tikal, but, did, not, mention, them, in, his, letters, after, spanish, friar, andr, s, de, avenda, o, became, lost, in, the, pet, n, forests, in, early, 1696, he, described, a, ruin, that, may, well, have, been, tikal, as, is, often, the, case, with, huge, ancient, ruins, knowledge, of, the, site, was, never, completely, lost, in, the, region, it, seems, that, local, people, never, forgot, about, tikal, and, they, guided, guatemalan, expeditions, to, the, ruins, in, the, 1850s, some, second, or, third, hand, accounts, of, tikal, appeared, in, print, starting, in, the, 17th, century, continuing, through, the, writings, of, john, lloyd, stephens, in, the, early, 19th, century, stephens, and, his, illustrator, frederick, catherwood, heard, rumors, of, a, lost, city, with, white, building, tops, towering, above, the, jungle, during, their, 1839, 40, travels, in, the, region, because, of, the, site, s, remoteness, from, modern, towns, however, no, explorers, visited, tikal, until, modesto, m, ndez, and, ambrosio, tut, respectively, the, commissioner, and, the, governor, of, pet, n, visited, it, in, 1848, artist, eusebio, lara, accompanied, them, and, their, account, was, published, in, germany, in, 1853, several, other, expeditions, came, to, further, investigate, map, and, photograph, tikal, in, the, 19th, century, including, alfred, p, maudslay, in, 1881, 82, and, the, early, 20th, century, pioneering, archeologists, started, to, clear, map, and, record, the, ruins, in, the, 1880s, in, 1951, a, small, airstrip, was, built, at, the, ruins, which, previously, could, only, be, reached, by, several, days, travel, through, the, jungle, on, foot, or, mule, in, 1956, the, tikal, project, began, to, map, the, city, on, a, scale, not, previously, seen, in, the, maya, area, from, 1956, through, 1970, major, archeological, excavations, were, carried, out, by, the, university, of, pennsylvania, tikal, project, they, mapped, much, of, the, site, and, excavated, and, restored, many, of, the, structures, excavations, directed, by, edwin, m, shook, and, later, by, william, coe, of, the, university, investigated, the, north, acropolis, and, the, central, plaza, from, 1957, to, 1969, the, tikal, project, recorded, over, 200, monuments, at, the, site, in, 1979, the, guatemalan, government, began, a, further, archeological, project, at, tikal, which, continued, through, to, 1984, filmmaker, george, lucas, used, tikal, as, a, filming, location, for, the, fictional, moon, yavin, 4, in, the, first, star, wars, film, which, premiered, in, 1977, temple, i, at, tikal, was, featured, on, the, reverse, of, the, 50, centavo, banknote, eon, productions, used, the, site, for, the, james, bond, film, moonraker, tikal, is, now, a, major, tourist, attraction, surrounded, by, its, own, national, park, a, site, museum, has, been, built, at, tikal, it, was, completed, in, 1964, tikal, has, been, partially, restored, by, the, university, of, pennsylvania, and, the, government, of, guatemala, it, was, one, of, the, largest, of, the, classic, period, maya, cities, and, was, one, of, the, largest, cities, in, the, americas, the, architecture, of, the, ancient, city, is, built, from, limestone, and, includes, the, remains, of, temples, that, tower, over, 70, meters, 230, ft, high, large, royal, palaces, in, addition, to, a, number, of, smaller, pyramids, palaces, residences, administrative, buildings, platforms, and, inscribed, stone, monuments, there, is, even, a, building, which, seemed, to, have, been, a, jail, originally, with, wooden, bars, across, the, windows, and, doors, there, are, also, seven, courts, for, playing, the, mesoamerican, ballgame, including, a, set, of, 3, in, the, seven, temples, plaza, a, unique, feature, in, mesoamerica, the, limestone, used, for, construction, was, local, and, quarried, on, site, the, depressions, formed, by, the, extraction, of, stone, for, building, were, plastered, to, waterproof, them, and, were, used, as, reservoirs, together, with, some, waterproofed, natural, depressions, the, main, plazas, were, surfaced, with, stucco, and, laid, at, a, gradient, that, channelled, rainfall, into, a, system, of, canals, that, fed, the, reservoirs, the, residential, area, of, tikal, covers, an, estimated, 60, square, kilometers, 23, sq, mi, much, of, which, has, not, yet, been, cleared, mapped, or, excavated, the, 16, square, kilometers, 6, 2, sq, mi, area, around, the, site, core, has, been, intensively, mapped, it, may, have, enclosed, an, area, of, some, 125, square, kilometers, 48, sq, mi, see, below, a, huge, set, of, earthworks, discovered, by, dennis, e, puleston, and, donald, callender, in, the, 1960s, rings, tikal, with, a, 6, meter, 20, ft, wide, trench, behind, a, rampart, recently, a, project, exploring, the, defensive, earthworks, has, shown, that, the, scale, of, the, earthworks, is, highly, variable, and, that, in, many, places, it, is, inconsequential, as, a, defensive, feature, in, addition, some, parts, of, the, earthwork, were, integrated, into, a, canal, system, the, earthwork, of, tikal, varies, significantly, in, coverage, from, what, was, originally, proposed, and, it, is, much, more, complex, and, multifaceted, than, originally, thought, by, the, late, classic, a, network, of, sacbeob, causeways, linked, various, parts, of, the, city, running, for, several, kilometers, through, its, urban, core, these, linked, the, great, plaza, with, temple, 4, located, about, 750, meters, 2, 460, feet, to, the, west, and, the, temple, of, the, inscriptions, about, 1, kilometer, 0, 62, mi, to, the, southeast, these, broad, causeways, were, built, of, packed, and, plastered, limestone, and, have, been, named, after, early, explorers, and, archeologists, the, maler, maudslay, tozzer, and, m, ndez, causeways, they, assisted, the, passage, of, everyday, traffic, during, the, rain, season, and, also, served, as, dams, the, maler, causeway, runs, north, from, behind, temple, i, to, group, h, a, large, bas, relief, is, carved, onto, limestone, bedrock, upon, the, course, of, the, causeway, just, south, of, group, h, it, depicts, two, bound, captives, and, dates, to, the, late, classic, the, maudsley, causeway, runs, 0, 8, kilometers, 0, 50, mi, northeast, from, temple, iv, to, group, h, the, mendez, causeway, runs, southeast, from, the, east, plaza, to, temple, vi, a, distance, of, about, 1, 3, kilometers, 0, 81, mi, the, tozzer, causeway, runs, west, from, the, great, plaza, to, temple, iv, water, reservoirs, played, a, critical, role, in, the, development, and, maintenance, of, both, tikal, and, other, maya, cities, though, evidently, serving, as, a, body, of, water, to, draw, from, during, the, dry, season, and, drought, periods, water, reservoirs, also, possessed, a, cultural, and, political, significance, hence, noteworthy, investment, was, made, by, maya, societies, into, their, reservoirs, to, ensure, high, water, quality, as, well, as, consolidate, political, power, aside, from, tikal, notable, reservoirs, are, also, present, at, calakmul, caracol, and, naranjo, among, others, human, manipulation, of, the, natural, environment, can, result, in, unintended, consequences, for, instance, storing, water, not, only, can, result, in, decreased, water, quality, but, also, enable, endemic, diseases, and, pests, such, as, parasite, ridden, flies, and, malaria, bearing, mosquitoes, to, flourish, additionally, fungal, species, can, proliferate, in, improperly, stored, or, stressed, maize, which, can, produce, chemicals, like, aflatoxin, a, deadly, liver, carcinogen, however, the, maya, were, adept, in, constructing, reservoirs, that, could, guarantee, high, water, quality, the, maya, applied, their, knowledge, of, wetland, biosphere, ecology, and, ensured, a, balance, of, hydrophytic, and, macrophytic, plants, and, other, organisms, for, example, the, maya, widely, adopted, the, dotleaf, waterlily, nymphaea, ampla, in, their, reservoirs, bodies, of, water, dotleaf, waterlilies, have, bluish, undersides, that, prevent, passage, of, light, and, thus, minimizes, algae, growth, inhibits, evaporation, provides, shade, for, predators, of, pests, removes, nitrogen, through, their, roots, and, serves, as, an, indicator, of, acidic, conditions, as, water, lilies, cannot, tolerate, low, ph, levels, low, ph, levels, have, been, linked, to, tooth, corrosion, and, disruption, of, gut, homeostasis, lastly, lining, the, reservoir, with, clay, was, also, intelligently, applied, to, help, stabilize, water, ph, a, significant, proportion, of, royal, power, rested, in, what, the, ruling, party, could, materially, provide, for, their, subjects, i, e, water, during, annual, drought, through, massive, artificial, reservoirs, hence, water, and, by, extension, reservoirs, became, a, significant, part, of, the, maya, power, structure, this, also, means, that, a, way, for, maya, rulers, to, concentrate, their, power, would, be, through, proper, water, management, this, created, a, feedback, loop, in, which, tools, associated, with, water, management, became, associated, with, maya, rulers, the, association, of, clean, water, water, lilies, and, royal, power, is, amply, illustrated, in, the, iconography, this, also, means, that, when, water, was, mismanaged, the, rulers, were, blamed, for, it, for, example, in, the, maya, city, of, caracol, droughts, peaked, in, the, years, 806, 829, 842, 857, 895, 909, 921, and, 935, a, d, most, importantly, the, years, between, a, d, 804, and, 938, show, a, 36, to, 56, drop, in, precipitation, while, the, rulers, were, blamed, and, eventually, moved, away, the, common, people, stayed, the, great, plaza, lies, at, the, core, of, the, site, it, is, flanked, on, the, east, and, west, sides, by, two, great, temple, pyramids, on, the, north, side, it, is, bordered, by, the, north, acropolis, and, on, the, south, by, the, central, acropolis, the, central, acropolis, is, a, palace, complex, just, south, of, the, great, plaza, the, north, acropolis, together, with, the, great, plaza, immediately, to, the, south, is, one, of, the, most, studied, architectural, groups, in, the, maya, area, the, tikal, project, excavated, a, massive, trench, across, the, complex, thoroughly, investigating, its, construction, history, it, is, a, complex, group, with, construction, beginning, in, the, preclassic, period, around, 350, bc, it, developed, into, a, funerary, complex, for, the, ruling, dynasty, of, the, classic, period, with, each, additional, royal, burial, adding, new, temples, on, top, of, the, older, structures, after, ad, 400, a, row, of, tall, pyramids, was, added, to, the, earlier, northern, platform, which, measured, 100, by, 80, meters, 330, by, 260, ft, gradually, hiding, it, from, view, eight, temple, pyramids, were, built, in, the, 6th, century, ad, each, of, them, had, an, elaborate, roofcomb, and, a, stairway, flanked, by, masks, of, the, gods, by, the, 9th, century, ad, 43, stelae, and, 30, altars, had, been, erected, in, the, north, acropolis, 18, of, these, monuments, were, carved, with, hieroglyphic, texts, and, royal, portraits, the, north, acropolis, continued, to, receive, burials, into, the, postclassic, period, the, south, acropolis, is, found, next, to, temple, v, it, was, built, upon, a, large, basal, platform, that, covers, an, area, of, more, than, 20, 000, square, meters, 220, 000, sq, ft, the, plaza, of, the, seven, temples, is, to, the, west, of, the, south, acropolis, it, is, bordered, on, the, east, side, by, a, row, of, nearly, identical, temples, by, palaces, on, the, south, and, west, sides, and, by, an, unusual, triple, ballcourt, on, the, north, side, the, mundo, perdido, is, to, the, west, of, the, plaza, of, the, seven, temples, it, is, the, largest, ceremonial, complex, dating, from, the, preclassic, period, at, tikal, the, complex, was, organized, as, a, large, e, group, consisting, of, a, pyramid, aligned, with, a, platform, to, the, east, that, supported, three, temples, the, mundo, perdido, complex, was, rebuilt, many, times, over, the, course, of, its, history, by, ad, 250, 300, its, architectural, style, was, influenced, by, the, great, metropolis, of, teotihuacan, in, the, valley, of, mexico, including, the, use, of, the, talud, tablero, form, during, the, early, classic, period, c, 250, 600, the, mundo, perdido, became, one, of, the, twin, foci, of, the, city, the, other, being, the, north, acropolis, from, ad, 250, to, 378, it, may, have, served, as, the, royal, necropolis, the, mundo, perdido, complex, was, given, its, name, by, the, archeologists, of, the, university, of, pennsylvania, it, is, centered, upon, the, lost, world, pyramid, and, a, small, platform, to, the, west, of, it, to, the, south, of, mundo, perdido, recent, 2021, excavations, have, revealed, a, one, third, size, replication, of, la, ciudadela, or, the, citadel, in, teotihuacan, this, area, may, have, been, used, as, a, diplomatic, headquarters, and, as, an, effort, to, further, stamp, teotihuacan, culture, upon, the, residents, of, tikal, group, g, lies, just, south, of, the, mendez, causeway, the, complex, dates, to, the, late, classic, and,

completely, dismantled, in, ancient, times, and, some, others, were, partly, destroyed, they, vary, in, size, but, consist, of, two, pyramids, facing, each, other, on, an, east, west, axis, these, pyramids, are, flat, topped, and, have, stairways, on, all, four, sides, a, row, of, plain, stelae, is, placed, immediately, to, the, west, of, the, eastern, pyramid, and, to, the, north, of, the, pyramids, lying, roughly, equidistant, from, them, there, is, usually, a, sculpted, stela, and, altar, pair, on, the, south, side, of, these, complexes, there, is, a, long, vaulted, building, containing, a, single, room, with, nine, doorways, the, entire, complex, was, built, at, once, and, these, complexes, were, built, at, 20, year, or, k, atun, intervals, during, the, late, classic, the, first, twin, pyramid, complex, was, built, in, the, early, 6th, century, in, the, east, plaza, it, was, once, thought, that, these, complexes, were, unique, to, tikal, but, rare, examples, have, now, been, found, at, other, sites, such, as, yaxha, and, ixlu, and, they, may, reflect, the, extent, of, tikal, s, political, dominance, in, the, late, classic, group, q, is, a, twin, pyramid, complex, and, is, one, of, the, largest, at, tikal, it, was, built, by, yax, nuun, ayiin, ii, in, 771, in, order, to, mark, the, end, of, the, 17th, k, atun, most, of, it, has, been, restored, and,

temples, i, vi, each, of, which, support, a, temple, structure, on, their, summits, some, of, these, pyramids, are, over, 60, meters, 200, feet, high, they, were, numbered, sequentially, during, the, early, survey, of, the, site, it, is, estimated, that, each, of, these, major, temples, could, have, been, built, in, as, little, as, two, years, temple, i, also, known, as, the, temple, of, ah,
