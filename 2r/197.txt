the, odrysian, kingdom, o, d, r, n, ancient, greek, was, an, ancient, thracian, state, that, thrived, between, the, early, 5th, century, bc, and, the, early, 3rd, late, 1st, century, bc, located, in, present, day, bulgaria, southeastern, romania, northern, dobruja, northern, greece, and, european, turkey, it, was, a, tribal, amalgam, dominated, by, the, odrysians, that, was, the, first, large, political, entity, to, develop, in, the, eastern, balkans, the, odrysian, kingdom, was, founded, by, king, teres, i, exploiting, the, collapse, of, the, persian, presence, in, europe, due, to, the, failed, invasion, of, greece, in, 480, 79, teres, and, his, son, sitalces, pursued, a, policy, of, expansion, making, the, kingdom, one, of, the, most, powerful, of, its, time, throughout, much, of, its, early, history, it, remained, an, ally, of, athens, and, even, joined, the, peloponnesian, war, on, its, side, by, 400, bc, the, state, showed, first, signs, of, fatigue, although, the, skilled, cotys, i, initiated, a, brief, renaissance, that, lasted, until, his, murder, in, 360, bc, afterwards, the, kingdom, disintegrated, southern, and, central, thrace, were, divided, among, three, odrysian, kings, while, the, northeast, came, under, the, dominion, of, the, kingdom, of, the, getae, the, three, odrysian, kingdoms, were, eventually, conquered, by, the, rising, kingdom, of, macedon, under, philip, ii, in, 340, bc, a, much, smaller, odrysian, state, was, revived, in, around, 330, bc, by, seuthes, iii, who, founded, a, new, capital, named, seuthopolis, that, functioned, until, the, second, quarter, of, the, 3rd, century, bc, after, that, there, is, little, conclusive, evidence, for, the, persistence, of, an, odrysian, state, with, the, exception, of, a, dubious, odrysian, king, fighting, in, the, third, macedonian, war, named, cotys, the, odrysian, heartland, was, eventually, annexed, by, the, sapaean, kingdom, in, the, late, 1st, century, bc, which, was, converted, into, a, roman, province, of, thracia, in, 45, 46, ad, since, the, ancient, thracians, lacked, an, indigenous, writing, tradition, the, most, important, sources, for, the, reconstruction, of, their, history, are, archaeological, remains, coins, as, well, as, accounts, of, ancient, greek, historians, said, historians, considered, the, thracians, to, be, a, numerous, people, and, their, country, thrace, to, be, of, barely, comprehensible, size, so, large, that, andron, of, halicarnassus, 4th, century, bc, thought, of, it, as, a, continent, of, its, own, while, the, boundaries, of, thrace, fluctuated, throughout, history, thrace, can, be, divided, in, a, northern, and, a, southern, half, which, were, also, culturally, different, the, border, between, the, two, halves, has, been, identified, as, the, haemus, mountains, or, the, danube, slightly, further, north, southern, thrace, covered, the, fertile, valley, between, the, haemus, and, the, rhodopes, the, strandzha, and, the, shores, of, the, propontis, and, the, aegean, and, black, seas, the, western, boundary, was, marked, by, the, strymon, and, the, upper, morava, northern, thrace, was, defined, by, the, danube, the, carpathians, and, the, adjacent, western, tip, of, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, thus, enclosing, parts, of, the, territory, now, comprising, modern, romania, moldova, serbia, and, ukraine, thrace, also, extended, into, what, is, now, northwestern, turkey, both, west, and, east, bithynia, mysia, of, the, propontis, thracians, had, already, settled, in, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, and, were, featured, in, the, epics, of, homer, occasional, references, to, them, appear, in, the, following, centuries, although, it, was, not, until, the, 5th, century, when, greek, literature, developed, an, interest, in, discussing, non, greeks, more, extensively, in, the, 7th, and, 6th, centuries, much, of, the, thracian, coast, was, settled, by, greek, colonists, who, founded, numerous, towns, like, thasos, byzantion, or, odessos, the, political, history, of, the, thracian, tribes, of, this, age, is, virtually, unknown, although, it, is, recorded, that, in, the, late, 6th, century, athenian, settlers, interacted, with, a, king, of, thrace, and, possible, predecessor, of, the, odrysian, kings, residing, north, of, the, chersonese, peninsula, the, absence, of, imported, artefacts, confirms, that, inland, thrace, north, of, the, rhodopes, remained, largely, isolated, from, the, aegean, trade, until, the, late, 6th, century, in, around, 513, bc, an, army, of, the, mighty, persian, dynasty, of, the, achaemenids, crossed, the, bosphorus, after, already, having, subdued, the, thracians, of, bithynia, thirty, years, earlier, king, darius, i, s, goal, was, a, punitive, expedition, against, the, scythians, at, the, northern, shores, of, the, black, sea, most, eastern, thracian, tribes, submitted, peacefully, except, of, the, getae, who, were, defeated, more, expeditions, under, the, generals, megabazus, and, mardonius, as, well, as, king, xerxes, i, followed, even, though, they, only, managed, to, secure, the, aegean, coast, it, seems, most, likely, that, the, achaemenids, did, not, establish, a, satrapy, provincial, administration, in, thrace, even, though, the, historian, herodotus, claimed, that, the, subdued, regions, had, to, pay, taxes, as, a, matter, of, fact, there, is, no, evidence, for, important, administrative, centers, instead, persian, authority, was, merely, exercised, through, a, couple, of, garrisoned, forts, most, importantly, those, of, doriskos, and, eion, hence, the, vast, majority, of, thrace, remained, unaffected, by, the, persian, presence, after, the, failed, invasion, of, greece, in, 480, 79, the, persian, foothold, in, europe, collapsed, by, around, 450, persian, authority, in, europe, including, thrace, had, vanished, entirely, although, the, persian, presence, in, thrace, was, short, lived, it, probably, stimulated, trade, and, first, state, formations, among, the, thracians, mintings, of, thracian, coins, started, around, 500, and, may, be, an, indicator, for, a, variety, of, early, tribal, kingdoms, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, odrysian, kingdom, might, have, had, its, origins, in, this, period, even, though, the, name, of, the, odrysians, is, notably, absent, from, the, numismatic, evidence, the, odrysians, eventually, stepped, into, the, light, of, history, in, the, aftermath, of, the, persian, failure, in, greece, when, they, were, mentioned, by, herodotus, but, without, any, further, details, the, odrysians, had, their, core, territory, in, the, valleys, of, the, hebros, river, and, its, tributaries, tonzos, and, arda, like, other, thracian, polities, the, odrysian, tribal, kingdom, attempted, to, fill, the, vacuum, left, by, the, persian, retreat, the, first, known, odrysian, king, was, the, expansionist, teres, i, who, is, claimed, by, thucydides, to, have, been, the, first, odrysian, king, altogether, writing, in, the, late, 5th, century, bc, he, wrote, that, teres, was, the, first, powerful, king, of, the, odrysae, and, that, he, was, the, first, founder, of, the, great, odrysian, empire, which, he, extended, over, a, large, part, of, thrace, although, many, of, the, thracian, tribes, are, still, independent, said, independent, tribes, consisted, of, thracians, living, along, parts, of, the, aegean, coast, and, in, parts, of, the, rhodope, mountains, and, as, well, as, the, powerful, triballi, around, the, haemus, teres, most, likely, came, to, dominate, central, thrace, soon, after, 480, bc, building, his, realm, on, a, privileged, warrior, aristocracy, he, and, his, son, sitalces, expanded, the, realm, from, the, danube, in, the, north, to, the, outskirts, of, abdera, at, the, aegean, sea, he, also, expanded, to, eastern, thrace, although, he, suffered, a, setback, at, the, hands, of, the, thynoi, in, the, north, east, he, cemented, the, position, of, his, realm, by, allying, himself, with, the, kingdom, of, scythia, under, king, ariapeithes, who, married, teres, daughter, in, conclusion, the, odrysians, were, the, first, to, supersede, the, thracian, tribal, system, and, establish, a, large, state, in, the, eastern, balkans, around, the, middle, of, the, 5th, century, when, sitalces, had, not, yet, succeeded, his, father, the, odrysians, intervened, in, a, scythian, civil, war, seemingly, on, the, side, of, the, dethroned, king, scylas, against, octamasadas, who, was, a, son, of, ariapeithes, and, teres, sister, when, the, two, armies, met, at, the, danube, however, sitalces, simply, agreed, to, hand, over, scylas, who, was, killed, on, the, spot, for, an, unnamed, brother, of, his, who, resided, among, the, scythians, another, important, event, may, have, happened, further, east, in, the, bosporan, kingdom, when, a, thracian, named, spartokos, seized, power, in, around, 438, it, is, not, unlikely, that, he, was, of, odrysian, descent, and, that, his, takeover, was, instigated, by, the, odrysian, royal, house, although, this, must, remain, speculation, archaeological, evidence, confirms, that, by, the, middle, of, the, 5th, century, bc, a, new, and, powerful, elite, had, emerged, that, accumulated, a, wealth, of, precious, artifacts, of, both, local, and, regional, origin, burial, practices, were, changing, after, the, persian, withdrawal, and, a, new, type, of, elite, burial, emerged, in, central, thrace, in, the, form, of, tombs, with, ashlar, masonry, sometimes, with, stone, sarcophagi, the, tomb, of, rouets, from, the, late, 5th, century, even, contained, traces, of, wall, paintings, the, earliest, of, these, new, elite, tombs, can, be, found, in, the, necropolis, of, duvanli, with, the, oldest, tombs, dating, to, the, mid, 5th, century, their, inventory, is, exceptional, not, only, by, contemporary, thracian, but, even, mediterranean, standards, according, to, the, archaeologist, tonkova, they, contained, splendid, sets, of, head, and, body, ornaments, consisting, of, numerous, hoop, or, boat, shaped, earrings, pendants, for, earrings, a, necklace, a, torque, bracelets, finger, rings, chains, with, pendants, and, fibulae, and, pectorals, most, thracian, elite, tombs, have, been, identified, as, warrior, burials, as, they, contained, weapons, and, gold, pectorals, two, burials, from, svetitsa, second, half, of, the, 5th, century, bc, and, dalakova, early, 4th, century, bc, also, contained, finely, crafted, and, rather, impressive, gold, funeral, masks, teres, who, is, claimed, to, have, lived, 92, years, had, died, by, the, outbreak, of, the, peloponnesian, war, in, 431, his, successor, was, his, son, sitalces, whose, reign, is, mostly, known, thanks, to, the, account, of, thucydides, before, the, war, he, is, known, to, have, campaigned, against, the, paeonians, in, the, west, subjugating, some, of, the, tribes, living, along, the, upper, reaches, of, the, strymon, now, his, influence, extended, over, much, of, bulgaria, greek, and, turkish, thrace, and, also, parts, of, southeastern, romania, from, the, strymon, and, iskar, rivers, in, the, west, to, the, black, sea, and, the, propontis, in, the, east, as, well, as, the, haemus, and, the, mouth, of, the, danube, which, was, ruled, by, the, tributary, getae, in, the, north, according, to, thucydides, the, odrysian, state, was, very, powerful, and, in, revenue, and, general, prosperity, exceeded, all, the, nations, of, europe, which, lie, between, the, ionian, sea, and, the, euxine, in, the, south, much, of, coastal, thrace, had, passed, under, the, rule, of, athens, making, them, direct, neighbours, of, the, odrysians, the, athenians, had, already, taken, some, interest, in, the, thracian, interior, before, 431, but, it, was, in, said, year, when, they, concluded, an, alliance, with, sitalces, against, perdiccas, ii, of, macedon, in, the, west, this, pact, was, cemented, by, a, dynastic, marriage, as, sitalces, would, marry, the, sister, of, the, athenian, ambassador, nymphodoros, of, abdera, sitalces, son, sadokos, was, sent, to, athens, and, was, granted, the, athenian, citizenship, sitalces, apparently, an, experienced, leader, with, political, acumen, would, prove, his, commitment, to, the, alliance, in, the, next, year, when, he, arrested, a, peloponnesian, embassy, that, tried, to, persuade, him, to, join, the, spartan, side, and, handed, it, over, to, athens, at, the, turn, of, the, year, 428, sitalces, raised, a, massive, multi, ethnic, army, to, march, against, macedon, and, insurgents, on, the, chalcidice, peninsula, his, army, consisted, of, a, variety, of, thracians, some, like, those, of, the, rhodopes, were, independent, but, joined, nonetheless, getae, and, some, paeonians, while, sitalces, managed, to, subjugate, some, of, the, thracian, tribes, of, the, lower, strymon, his, invasion, of, eastern, macedon, and, the, chalkidiki, was, less, successful, as, his, opponents, avoided, open, combat, and, simply, hid, behind, their, walls, the, odrysian, army, had, not, the, means, to, storm, them, plus, winter, was, approaching, and, food, supplies, were, running, out, furthermore, the, athenian, force, that, was, promised, to, them, never, arrived, perhaps, because, athens, feared, the, might, of, the, unleashed, thracian, kingdom, after, failed, negotiations, with, perdiccas, ii, sitalces, retreated, back, home, thus, after, only, 30, days, the, odrysian, invasion, had, come, to, an, end, sitalces, was, succeeded, in, 424, by, his, nephew, seuthes, i, after, the, former, was, killed, while, campaigning, against, the, triballi, who, resided, north, of, the, western, haemus, throughout, his, reign, the, odrysians, did, not, intervene, in, coastal, thrace, which, had, now, become, a, contested, battlefield, between, athens, and, sparta, athens, for, its, part, began, to, make, heavy, use, of, thracian, mercenaries, acting, as, light, skirmishers, the, peltasts, due, to, their, success, the, greeks, soon, began, to, raise, peltast, units, of, their, own, still, the, athenians, eventually, lost, the, peleponnesian, war, and, for, a, few, years, at, least, much, of, their, influence, in, the, northern, aegean, seuthes, i, was, eventually, succeeded, by, amadocus, i, also, known, as, medokos, in, around, 410, or, 405, bc, by, the, turn, of, the, 4th, century, the, odrysian, kingdom, showed, its, tendency, towards, fragmentation, two, rulers, are, known, by, 405, amadocus, i, and, seuthes, ii, the, historian, diodorus, siculus, even, called, both, of, them, kings, of, the, thracians, although, this, is, most, likely, a, misunderstanding, by, 405, seuthes, ii, still, considered, amadocus, i, as, his, suzerein, amadocus, was, the, son, of, the, previous, king, seuthes, i, while, seuthes, ii, was, the, son, of, a, thracian, chieftain, named, maisades, maisades, was, a, descendant, of, king, teres, making, seuthes, ii, and, amadocus, i, distant, relatives, there, was, also, an, autonomous, odrysian, prince, in, the, western, hinterlands, of, byzantium, named, teres, initially, raised, at, the, court, of, amadocus, seuthes, was, sent, to, eastern, thrace, several, years, before, 405, by, 405, he, had, managed, to, consolidate, his, position, over, a, realm, stretching, from, apollonia, pontica, over, the, strandzha, to, parts, of, the, northern, propontis, coast, in, 400, bc, he, hired, greek, mercenaries, under, xenophon, to, expand, his, dominion, at, the, cost, of, teres, and, other, rebels, forcing, them, to, reacknowledge, the, authority, of, amadocus, due, to, lacking, funds, they, left, his, service, already, after, two, months, seuthes, ii, eventually, rose, against, amadocus, although, little, is, known, about, this, insurrection, in, 389, the, athenian, general, thrasybulus, mediated, between, the, two, parties, resulting, in, seuthes, ii, whom, xenophon, called, ruler, of, the, coast, region, recognizing, amadocus, authority, again, amadocus, who, had, defied, seuthes, insurrection, probably, due, to, his, own, popularity, died, soon, after, 389, his, successor, was, hebryzelmis, about, whom, very, little, is, known, but, who, like, amadocus, sought, the, good, will, of, athens, seuthes, ii, on, the, other, hand, allied, with, sparta, an, athenian, inscription, from, the, year, 386, 5, confirms, that, hebryzelmis, sent, a, delegation, to, athens, to, legitimize, his, rule, and, or, gain, an, ally, against, seuthes, however, the, athenians, had, little, interest, in, another, war, in, the, region, and, thus, limited, themselves, to, kind, words, meanwhile, seuthes, had, risen, yet, again, against, the, crown, this, second, war, went, badly, as, he, seemingly, lost, all, of, his, domains, before, reconquering, them, thanks, to, a, mercenary, army, led, by, iphicrates, iphicrates, subsequently, married, the, daughter, of, seuthes, son, cotys, i, cotys, i, succeeded, seuthes, ii, in, 383, the, historian, michael, zahrnt, described, cotys, as, the, right, man, to, strengthen, the, run, down, odrysian, realm, vigorous, and, an, artful, diplomat, indeed, it, was, under, him, that, the, kingdom, reached, its, greatest, might, and, became, a, considerable, political, factor, in, the, nascent, hellenistic, world, he, was, also, the, only, odrysian, king, whose, character, was, excessively, discussed, by, ancient, scholars, although, primarily, in, a, rather, unfavourable, way, while, virtually, nothing, is, known, about, the, early, years, of, his, rule, it, is, clear, that, he, together, with, his, son, in, law, iphicrates, managed, to, conquer, the, domains, of, the, deceased, hebryzelmis, thus, uniting, the, odrysian, realm, under, his, rule, in, 375, he, faced, an, invasion, of, the, triballi, who, devastated, the, western, parts, of, the, realm, while, marching, towards, abdera, at, the, coast, cotys, eventually, set, his, eyes, on, the, strategic, chersonese, and, the, hellespont, challenging, the, athenian, hegemony, in, the, region, the, athenians, were, more, than, ready, to, fight, for, the, control, of, the, hellespont, as, it, was, vital, for, athens, grain, supply, from, the, northern, black, sea, region, an, early, invasion, in, 367, failed, but, in, 363, 2, cotys, was, more, successful, and, repeatedly, defeated, several, athenian, generals, thus, the, chersonese, and, the, hellespont, had, come, under, direct, odrysian, rule, this, achievement, however, proved, shortlived, much, to, athens, relief, cotys, i, was, eventually, murdered, in, 360, 59, the, death, of, cotys, almost, contemporary, to, the, coronation, of, the, talented, philip, ii, of, macedon, marked, the, beginning, of, the, kingdom, s, downfall, the, odrysian, state, was, divided, among, three, competing, kings, cersebleptes, the, son, of, cotys, ruled, the, eastern, parts, beyond, the, lower, hebros, and, tonzos, amadocus, ii, perhaps, a, son, of, amadocus, i, ruled, central, thrace, between, maroneia, and, the, meritsa, berisades, controlled, the, western, part, from, maroneia, in, the, east, to, the, styrmon, in, the, west, cersebleptes, was, the, most, ambitious, of, the, three, he, continued, his, father, s, war, against, athens, for, the, chersonese, while, also, striving, to, reunite, the, odrysian, kingdom, his, attempts, proved, futile, for, amadocus, ii, and, berisades, who, received, support, from, athens, resisted, his, attacks, in, 357, he, was, forced, to, accept, a, peace, treaty, that, sealed, the, division, of, the, odrysian, state, an, inscription, from, athens, describes, said, treaty, first, cersebleptes, had, to, cease, his, hostilities, in, the, cheresonese, second, all, three, kings, and, athens, agreed, to, share, their, tributes, received, from, the, greek, colonies, along, the, aegean, and, the, hellespont, third, the, kings, promised, to, enter, an, alliance, with, athens, and, both, sides, had, to, provide, each, other, with, military, support, if, tributary, greek, colonies, revolted, cersebleptes, however, soon, quit, that, treaty, and, continued, his, war, in, the, chersonese, as, early, as, 359, the, year, of, his, coronation, philip, ii, of, macedon, i, contacted, a, thracian, king, to, persuade, him, to, not, harbour, a, macedonian, pretender, to, the, throne, this, king, is, probably, to, be, identified, with, the, western, odrysian, king, berisades, a, year, later, he, unified, macedon, and, subjugated, the, paeonians, to, the, northeast, in, these, early, years, he, did, not, bother, much, with, thrace, yet, as, he, regarded, the, infighting, odrysian, kingdoms, as, no, threat, for, his, rule, a, first, push, into, the, kingdom, of, berisades, and, his, successor, cetriporis, occurred, in, 357, 6, when, he, conquered, amphipolis, and, crenides, the, latter, was, made, into, a, garrison, town, called, philippi, that, was, to, serve, as, a, launch, pad, for, future, invasions, into, the, interior, cetriporis, allied, himself, with, the, kings, of, paeonia, and, illyria, but, philip, ii, defeated, them, one, by, one, cetriporis, was, allowed, to, keep, his, kingdom, at, least, for, a, few, more, years, cersebleptes, continued, his, attempts, to, unite, the, odrysian, kingdoms, in, 353, 4, he, and, philip, discussed, the, invasion, of, the, kingdom, of, amadocus, ii, and, the, athenian, domains, in, thrace, while, around, a, year, later, he, marched, against, the, kingdom, of, cetriporis, meanwhile, athens, feared, a, possible, alliance, between, philip, and, cersebleptes, and, decided, to, make, an, example, by, conquering, the, town, of, sestos, and, eradicating, its, population, intimidated, cersebleptes, renounced, his, claims, on, much, of, the, chersonese, and, allied, with, athens, this, was, unacceptable, for, philip, who, allied, with, amadocus, ii, and, marched, against, cersebleptes, after, besieging, him, in, his, residence, in, heraion, teichos, in, 351, he, forced, the, thracian, king, to, surrender, and, took, his, son, as, a, hostage, around, this, time, philip, also, abolished, cetriporis, kingdom, and, deposed, amadocus, ii, in, favour, of, teres, ii, after, these, events, the, thracian, front, remained, peaceful, until, 347, or, early, 346, when, the, athenians, again, attempted, to, strengthen, their, presence, in, thrace, which, they, probably, did, at, the, request, of, cersebleptes, macedon, expelled, the, athenian, garrisons, and, defeated, the, odrysians, preventing, yet, again, a, thraco, athenian, alliance, against, him, as, a, result, of, this, campaign, philip, also, put, the, aeagean, coast, as, far, east, as, acontisma, not, the, banks, of, the, nestos, river, as, often, assumed, under, direct, macedonian, administration, a, few, years, later, cersebleptes, allied, with, teres, ii, and, invaded, the, chersonese, which, was, now, under, macedon, s, protection, after, asking, the, persian, king, artaxerxes, iii, to, cut, the, support, of, the, ionian, towns, for, cersebleptes, philip, finally, felt, confident, enough, to, begin, his, most, ambitious, project, so, far, the, conquest, of, inland, thrace, in, the, form, of, a, large, campaign, that, would, last, from, 342, to, 340, few, details, are, known, about, this, campaign, it, seems, to, have, started, in, may, or, june, when, philip, s, army, penetrated, the, interior, by, marching, upstream, the, hebrus, river, the, odrysians, resisted, valiantly, and, confronted, the, macedonians, in, many, battles, philip, faced, several, setbacks, and, even, seems, to, have, lost, at, least, one, battle, by, the, spring, of, 341, fighting, was, still, raging, and, philip, was, forced, to, call, in, reinforcements, although, detailed, evidence, is, lacking, he, finally, managed, to, improve, his, situation, and, defeated, cersebleptes, and, teres, at, some, point, between, the, second, half, of, 341, and, the, first, half, of, 340, the, getae, a, northern, thracian, people, located, between, the, northeastern, foothills, of, the, haemus, range, and, the, lower, danube, and, the, black, sea, had, been, part, of, the, odrysian, realm, since, teres, i, even, though, it, is, not, clear, how, tightly, they, were, actually, incorporated, into, the, state, when, and, how, the, getae, became, independent, is, not, discussed, in, the, available, sources, perhaps, they, became, independent, during, the, rule, of, cotys, i, or, after, his, death, in, 360, rich, funeral, treasures, from, the, second, half, of, the, 4th, century, like, those, of, agighiol, peretu, or, borovo, attest, to, the, increasing, wealth, of, the, getic, elite, several, artefacts, seem, to, have, originated, in, the, odrysian, kingdom, and, may, well, have, been, prestige, gifts, by, the, middle, of, the, 4th, century, there, existed, a, getic, kingdom, that, was, to, thrive, for, a, century, the, getic, capital, was, helis, which, has, been, identified, with, the, archaeological, site, of, sboryanovo, which, was, founded, in, the, 330s, or, early, 320s, and, housed, around, 10, 000, inhabitants, it, seems, that, the, getae, also, became, active, in, muntenia, north, of, the, danube, a, region, that, would, come, to, constitute, a, part, of, the, dacia, of, imperial, roman, historiography, the, first, getic, king, to, appear, in, the, sources, was, cothelas, who, married, his, daughter, meda, to, philip, ii, thus, concluding, an, alliance, between, the, two, states, this, probably, happened, during, or, shortly, after, philip, s, conquest, of, the, odrysians, the, kingdom, survived, two, wars, with, lysimachus, and, the, celtic, invasion, in, around, 280, but, eventually, disintegrated, a, few, decades, later, helis, sboryanovo, was, completely, destroyed, by, an, earthquake, in, the, middle, of, the, 3rd, century, the, conquest, of, the, odrysian, kingdoms, doubled, the, size, of, the, domains, ruled, by, philip, ii, even, though, inland, thrace, was, not, transformed, into, a, macedonian, province, but, was, put, under, the, loose, control, of, a, strategos, local, thracian, rulers, who, seemed, trustworthy, were, allowed, to, rule, on, macedonian, behalf, granted, that, they, would, pay, a, tithe, and, provide, troops, such, troops, generally, called, thracians, or, odrysians, participated, in, the, macedonian, conquest, of, persia, under, philip, s, successor, alexander, the, great, and, were, probably, commanded, by, odrysian, noblemen, philip, founded, several, towns, in, thrace, to, ease, macedonian, rule, most, prominently, cabyle, and, philippopolis, the, situation, south, of, the, haemus, remained, largely, stable, for, the, next, few, years, albeit, even, here, macedon, never, managed, to, impose, its, rule, over, all, thracian, tribes, macedon, s, rule, was, precarious, and, a, potential, odrysian, upstarter, could, count, on, the, support, of, much, of, the, disgruntled, population, with, alexander, s, absence, in, asia, the, strategoi, of, thrace, engaged, in, rebellions, and, failed, expeditions, against, the, getae, greatly, unsettling, the, country, in, the, process, at, the, end, of, the, 330s, or, in, the, mid, 320s, the, dating, is, not, entirely, clear, a, certain, seuthes, later, known, as, seuthes, iii, instigated, a, thracian, rebellion, he, seems, to, have, been, an, odrysian, and, may, have, been, associated, with, the, royal, house, of, cersebleptes, although, his, social, background, must, remain, speculation, after, alexander, s, death, in, 323, one, of, his, bodyguards, named, lysimachus, was, appointed, as, the, satrap, of, thrace, soon, after, his, arrival, he, faced, off, with, seuthes, who, had, rallied, much, of, thrace, around, his, banner, seuthes, goal, seems, to, have, been, the, revival, of, an, independent, odrysian, state, a, battle, ensued, between, him, and, lysimachus, which, lysimachus, barely, and, by, no, means, decisively, won, both, sides, prepared, for, a, second, conflict, but, the, primary, source, for, this, event, diodorus, siculus, provides, no, details, on, its, outcome, in, any, case, both, parties, eventually, reached, a, settlement, restricting, seuthes, to, the, interior, and, lysimachus, to, the, coastal, regions, of, the, aegean, and, black, sea, there, is, no, evidence, for, lysimachus, vassalizing, seuthes, thrace, north, of, the, rhodopes, probably, remained, outside, of, lysimachus, reach, as, he, may, have, regarded, its, pacification, not, worth, the, money, and, manpower, in, 313, seuthes, allied, with, revolting, greek, towns, on, the, western, shore, of, the, black, sea, but, lysimachus, defeated, this, alliance, it, is, possible, that, to, guarantee, the, peace, between, the, two, opponents, seuthes, married, a, daughter, of, lysimachus, named, berenice, afterwards, there, is, no, evidence, for, another, confrontation, between, the, two, seuthes, was, keen, to, establish, a, hellenistic, kingdom, although, he, avoided, to, label, himself, as, king, on, his, coins, probably, after, the, death, of, alexander, in, 323, seuthes, founded, a, town, at, the, tonzos, river, near, modern, kazanlak, he, named, it, after, himself, seuthopolis, the, town, was, primarily, based, on, contemporary, macedonian, foundations, and, showed, heavy, greek, influences, seuthopolis, probably, acted, as, the, capital, of, seuthes, kingdom, the, size, and, power, of, this, kingdom, should, not, be, overestimated, as, its, influence, was, most, likely, limited, to, the, hinterland, of, seuthopolis, in, particular, the, valley, between, the, rhodopes, in, the, south, to, the, haemus, in, the, north, and, the, syrmus, in, the, west, to, the, upper, tonzos, in, the, east, thus, his, realm, only, covered, the, northwestern, fringes, of, the, former, odrysian, empire, seuthes, also, only, issued, bronze, coins, which, were, insufficient, to, challenge, the, macedonian, economic, hegemony, and, its, royal, mintings, in, more, precious, metals, it, is, unknown, when, seuthes, iii, died, with, estimations, ranging, from, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, to, the, 280s, coins, minted, in, his, name, include, overstruck, coins, of, cassander, died, 297, and, lysimachus, died, 281, implying, that, his, coins, were, produced, until, the, early, years, of, the, 3rd, century, bc, seuthes, was, symbolically, buried, in, the, tumulus, of, golyama, kosmatka, without, his, actual, corpse, it, may, well, be, that, he, had, been, killed, in, battle, perhaps, fighting, against, lysimachus, or, with, him, as, an, ally, a, long, inscription, from, seuthopolis, attests, to, the, decline, of, the, fortunes, of, the, town, and, the, trouble, in, seuthes, household, it, mentions, the, wife, of, seuthes, berenice, and, their, four, probably, underage, sons, hebryzelmis, teres, satocos, and, satalas, the, document, was, issued, in, the, name, of, berenice, and, includes, the, phrase, when, seuthes, was, in, good, health, which, implies, that, by, the, time, of, writing, he, was, either, dead, or, dying, and, that, berenice, had, taken, the, rule, the, inscription, describes, negotiations, between, berenice, and, spartokos, the, ruler, of, cabyle, a, town, once, founded, by, philip, ii, indeed, cabyle, had, not, remained, a, macedonian, fort, for, long, but, began, to, mint, coins, and, developed, into, a, city, state, with, considerable, influence, spartokos, is, known, from, several, coins, minted, after, 281, where, he, is, addressed, as, king, basileus, although, not, mentioned, in, the, seuthopolis, inscription, and, known, only, from, a, few, coins, and, an, inscription, in, a, grave, from, kazanlak, seuthes, seemed, to, have, another, son, named, roigos, who, eventually, became, king, the, fate, of, seuthes, dynasty, remains, enigmatic, other, thracian, monarchs, recorded, in, sources, from, the, 3rd, century, like, cotys, or, scostocus, can, not, be, proved, to, have, been, odrysian, even, if, they, are, often, labelled, as, such, by, modern, authors, the, end, of, seuthopolis, is, a, matter, of, debate, but, it, is, clear, that, the, town, was, destroyed, still, in, the, first, half, of, the, 3rd, century, according, to, some, scholars, it, was, conquered, by, the, celts, in, the, 270s, the, celts, were, ravaging, much, of, the, balkan, peninsula, since, the, early, 270s, and, also, led, numerous, incursions, into, thrace, in, c, 278, and, led, by, comontorius, they, eventually, founded, a, kingdom, in, eastern, thrace, centered, around, tylis, a, newer, theory, proposes, the, destruction, of, the, town, in, the, 250s, based, on, a, revamped, dating, of, pottery, numismatic, evidence, and, the, presence, of, several, celtic, artefacts, the, archaeological, evidence, also, shows, the, employment, of, siege, artillery, which, is, unlikely, to, have, been, utilized, by, celts, it, may, therefore, be, that, seuthopolis, was, not, destroyed, by, the, celts, but, by, the, seleucid, king, antiochus, ii, who, campaigned, in, the, thracian, interior, in, around, 252, most, modern, historians, believe, that, the, odrysian, kingdom, continued, to, exist, throughout, the, hellenistic, and, the, early, imperial, period, when, it, became, a, roman, vassal, state, however, the, evidence, for, this, assumption, is, in, fact, very, slim, throughout, the, remainder, of, the, 3rd, century, thrace, remained, fragmented, into, various, political, entities, in, the, interior, ruled, various, badly, known, thracian, dynasts, in, the, east, was, the, kingdom, of, tylis, a, celtic, dominated, predator, state, which, existence, was, based, on, blackmailing, tribute, and, that, was, eventually, destroyed, by, a, thracian, revolt, or, attack, soon, after, 220, in, the, southeast, and, based, at, the, town, of, lysimachia, the, seleucids, established, themselves, under, antiochus, ii, r, 261, 246, who, relied, on, allied, thracian, dynasts, to, expand, his, influence, deep, into, the, interior, after, his, death, in, 246, the, seleucid, presence, was, replaced, by, that, of, the, ptolemies, who, established, a, satrapy, in, coastal, thrace, an, odrysian, kingdom, however, is, not, described, in, the, sources, in, the, last, years, of, the, 3rd, century, macedonia, under, king, philip, v, began, a, renewed, expansion, to, the, east, exploiting, the, weakness, of, the, ptolemies, after, the, death, of, ptolemy, iv, while, philip, s, initial, focus, was, on, coastal, thrace, he, also, led, a, campaign, into, the, interior, temporarily, losing, his, thracian, holdings, after, the, end, of, the, second, macedonian, war, in, 197, he, reconquered, most, of, them, a, decade, later, while, again, campaigning, in, the, thracian, interior, in, 184, or, 183, he, pushed, into, the, plains, of, the, upper, hebros, defeated, the, odrysians, and, other, local, tribes, and, conquered, philipopolis, although, the, odrysians, reconquered, the, town, soon, afterwards, it, may, be, noteworthy, that, no, odrysian, king, is, mentioned, while, in, 181, philip, was, still, climbing, the, haemus, in, northern, thrace, his, thracian, empire, collapsed, with, his, death, two, years, later, between, 171, and, 168, philip, s, heir, perseus, engaged, the, roman, republic, in, the, third, macedonian, war, perseus, most, trusted, ally, in, this, war, was, the, thracian, king, cotys, whom, the, historian, polybius, calls, an, odrysian, he, fought, in, the, battles, of, callinicus, and, pydna, but, eventually, became, a, roman, ally, after, the, war, perhaps, he, is, identical, with, the, cotys, mentioned, by, the, historian, strabo, however, his, odrysian, background, has, been, doubted, as, the, account, of, polybius, the, only, remaining, source, minus, livy, who, relied, on, polybius, called, him, an, odrysian, only, once, while, also, calling, the, getic, king, dromichaetes, an, odrysian, it, may, thus, be, likely, that, polybius, used, odrysian, as, a, synonym, for, thracian, furthermore, after, the, war, cotys, was, described, as, being, active, in, the, hinterland, of, abdera, at, the, aegean, coast, implying, that, he, was, rather, a, sapaean, king, who, are, known, to, have, resided, in, the, rhodopes, his, identity, must, remain, uncertain, it, is, a, fact, however, that, cotys, was, the, last, king, in, the, sources, to, be, explicitly, labelled, an, odrysian, there, is, also, no, evidence, that, odrysians, had, any, affiliations, with, the, royal, houses, of, the, sapaeans, and, asti, of, the, 1st, century, bc, by, the, middle, of, the, 1st, century, bc, the, romans, dominated, coastal, thrace, while, the, most, important, thracian, tribes, were, the, sapaeans, and, the, asti, the, romans, decided, not, to, implement, an, administration, in, the, thracian, interior, but, instead, relied, on, indirect, influence, via, a, large, hellenized, client, kingdom, resembling, the, odrysian, kingdom, of, old, probably, soon, after, the, battle, of, actium, in, 31, bc, the, romans, abolished, the, asti, dynasty, and, established, the, sapaeans, in, bizye, the, capital, of, the, former, the, sapaeans, of, bizye, created, a, large, kingdom, loyal, to, rome, and, even, expanded, into, the, interior, little, is, known, about, how, the, sapaeans, administered, this, region, although, they, made, philippopolis, a, royal, residence, in, 21, ad, king, rhoemetalces, ii, took, refuge, in, philippopolis, when, he, was, confronted, with, a, rebellion, among, them, odrysians, while, the, historian, tacitus, described, them, as, powerful, their, uprising, failed, due, to, their, bad, coordination, the, romans, eventually, dissolved, the, sapaean, kingdom, in, 45, 6, and, turned, it, into, the, province, of, thracia, although, covering, almost, a, third, of, the, entire, balkan, peninsula, at, its, peak, the, odrysian, kingdom, is, unlikely, to, have, had, state, like, institutions, before, the, reign, of, seuthes, iii, in, general, the, odrysian, kingship, was, heavily, influenced, by, the, persian, court, while, also, bearing, many, similarities, to, the, one, practiced, in, macedon, unlike, in, the, contemporary, greek, city, states, the, odrysian, kings, needed, to, legitimize, their, rule, by, military, prowess, religion, and, gifts, the, royal, gift, exchange, a, practice, originally, adopted, from, the, persian, court, was, especially, important, for, legitimation, thucydides, noted, that, the, total, tribute, of, 400, talents, of, gold, and, silver, generated, under, king, seuthes, i, was, distributed, among, seuthes, as, well, as, the, chief, men, and, nobles, of, the, odrysae, several, inscribed, silver, vessels, mention, king, cotys, i, and, cersebleptes, and, were, most, likely, gifts, or, tribute, while, the, king, received, valuable, gifts, like, gold, silver, textiles, or, horses, he, was, also, expected, to, distribute, gifts, like, artefacts, women, or, land, to, earn, the, loyalty, and, achieve, the, expansion, of, his, military, retinue, such, systems, are, inevitably, unstable, royal, authority, would, always, remain, rather, fluid, due, to, the, fragmentary, nature, of, the, remaining, sources, the, royal, court, and, the, administration, of, the, kingdom, must, remain, largely, obscure, it, can, be, assumed, that, as, in, early, macedon, the, odrysian, kings, formed, the, heart, of, the, realm, and, controlled, the, policy, and, the, minting, of, coins, appointed, loyal, deputies, and, commanded, the, troops, on, the, battlefield, the, realm, was, essentially, the, king, s, estate, below, the, king, was, an, elite, of, horse, warriors, and, administrators, deriving, not, only, from, the, royal, court, but, also, from, rival, tribes, thucydides, called, said, local, rulers, paradynasteuontes, meaning, those, who, share, power, a, similar, elite, class, loyal, only, to, the, king, the, hetairoi, could, also, be, found, in, macedon, the, odrysian, kingdom, appears, to, have, been, rather, decentralized, consisting, of, many, different, regional, elites, vying, for, power, their, rule, over, their, subjects, who, lived, in, scattered, hamlets, was, very, loose, and, exercised, mainly, through, raiding, and, demanding, tribute, there, is, no, evidence, that, the, early, odrysian, kings, had, a, fixed, capital, instead, they, probably, maintained, a, mobile, court, moving, throughout, the, kingdom, and, residing, in, fortified, residences, these, small, fortified, places, which, the, greeks, called, thyrseis, were, the, backbones, of, the, thracian, aristocracy, in, a, society, that, did, not, build, towns, or, cities, this, changed, somewhat, in, the, late, 4th, century, when, seuthes, iii, founded, seuthopolis, marking, the, establishment, of, early, state, like, institutions, which, were, probably, inspired, by, those, of, hellenistic, macedon, seuthopolis, size, always, remained, quite, small, housing, not, more, than, 1, 000, inhabitants, it, is, very, likely, that, it, was, the, home, of, the, kingdom, s, aristocracy, while, the, common, population, continued, to, live, outside, the, city, walls, still, practicing, the, agro, pastoral, subsistence, economy, of, old, when, sitalces, army, invaded, macedon, he, supposedly, fielded, an, army, numbering, 150, 000, men, which, is, likely, an, inflated, number, around, 100, years, later, when, seuthes, iii, confronted, lysimachus, the, numbers, had, shrunk, to, 28, 000, men, a, considerable, part, of, these, armies, were, horsemen, of, sitalces, army, every, third, warrior, was, a, horseman, who, were, provided, by, the, odrysians, and, the, getae, while, the, army, of, seuthes, iii, had, 8, 000, riders, probably, all, odrysians, the, majority, of, sitalces, infantry, was, described, as, being, of, rather, low, quality, and, was, certainly, composed, of, ill, organized, levies, it, therefore, appears, that, warfare, remained, a, heroic, pursuit, worthy, only, of, the, aristocracy, while, military, training, for, the, commoners, was, considered, unfitting, despite, this, the, thracian, infantry, made, a, great, impression, on, the, greeks, who, hired, them, as, mercenaries, meanwhile, the, odrysian, kings, made, use, of, greek, mercenary, commanders, like, xenophon, or, iphicrates, while, greek, towns, inside, thrace, were, defended, by, the, colonists, themselves, initially, the, odrysian, army, was, divided, into, light, infantry, and, light, cavalry, the, infantry, used, bows, slings, spears, swords, axes, and, light, crescent, shaped, shields, called, pelte, giving, these, warriors, their, name, peltasts, round, and, oval, shields, were, however, also, utilized, a, weapon, primarily, found, in, the, western, and, central, rhodoes, was, the, rhomphaia, except, of, slings, the, cavalry, used, the, same, weapons, as, the, infantry, in, the, later, 5th, century, the, thracian, cavalry, began, to, adopt, armour, the, employed, helmets, were, of, the, chalcidian, phrygian, thracian, and, corinthian, types, of, which, the, chalcidian, type, seems, to, have, been, the, most, popular, the, earliest, torso, armour, was, a, type, of, primitive, muscle, cuirass, of, cylindrical, form, that, had, long, fallen, out, of, use, elsewhere, leather, and, linen, armour, was, also, worn, in, the, 4th, century, scale, armour, became, popular, while, greaves, were, also, adopted, at, that, time, finally, there, is, also, evidence, that, the, thracians, employed, siege, artillery, in, particular, catapults, odrysian, crafts, and, metalworking, were, largely, a, product, of, persian, influence, thracians, as, dacians, and, illyrians, all, decorated, themselves, with, status, enhancing, tattoos, thracian, warfare, was, affected, also, by, celts, and, the, triballi, had, adopted, celtic, equipment, thracian, clothing, is, regarded, for, its, quality, and, texture, and, was, made, up, of, hemp, flax, or, wool, their, clothing, resembled, that, of, the, scythians, including, jackets, with, coloured, edges, pointed, shoes, and, the, getai, tribe, were, so, similar, to, the, scythians, that, they, were, often, confused, with, them, the, nobility, and, some, soldiers, wore, caps, there, was, a, mutual, influence, between, the, greeks, and, the, thracians, greek, customs, and, fashions, contributed, to, the, recasting, of, east, balkan, society, among, the, nobility, greek, fashions, in, dress, ornament, and, military, equipment, were, popular, unlike, the, greeks, the, thracians, often, wore, trousers, thracian, kings, were, influenced, by, hellenization, greek, as, a, lingua, franca, had, been, spoken, at, least, by, some, members, of, the, royal, household, in, the, fifth, century, bc, and, became, the, language, of, administrators, the, greek, alphabet, was, adopted, as, the, new, thracian, script, residences, and, temples, of, the, odrysian, kingdom, have, been, found, particularly, around, starosel, in, the, sredna, gora, mountains, archaeologists, have, uncovered, the, northeastern, wall, of, the, thracian, kings, residence, 13, m, in, length, and, preserved, up, to, 2, m, in, height, they, also, found, the, names, of, cleobulus, and, anaxandros, philip, ii, of, macedon, s, generals, who, led, the, assault, on, the, odrysian, kingdom, the, list, below, includes, the, known, odrysian, kings, of, thrace, but, much, of, it, is, conjectural, based, on, incomplete, sources, and, the, varying, interpretation, of, ongoing, numismatic, and, archaeological, discoveries, various, other, thracian, kings, some, of, them, possibly, non, odrysian, are, included, as, well, odrysian, kings, though, called, kings, of, thrace, never, exercised, sovereignty, over, all, of, thrace, control, varied, according, to, tribal, relationships,
