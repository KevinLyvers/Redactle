the, franks, latin, franci, or, gens, francorum, german, franken, french, francs, were, a, western, european, people, during, the, roman, empire, and, middle, ages, they, began, as, a, germanic, people, who, lived, near, the, lower, rhine, on, the, northern, continental, frontier, of, the, empire, they, subsequently, expanded, their, power, and, influence, during, the, middle, ages, until, much, of, the, population, of, western, europe, particularly, in, and, near, france, were, commonly, described, as, franks, for, example, in, the, context, of, their, joint, efforts, during, the, crusades, starting, in, the, 11th, century, a, key, turning, point, in, this, evolution, was, when, the, frankish, merovingian, dynasty, based, within, the, collapsing, western, roman, empire, first, became, the, rulers, of, the, whole, region, between, the, rivers, loire, and, rhine, and, then, subsequently, imposed, power, over, many, other, post, roman, kingdoms, both, inside, and, outside, the, old, empire, although, the, frankish, name, does, not, appear, until, the, 3rd, century, at, least, some, of, the, original, frankish, tribes, had, long, been, known, to, the, romans, under, their, own, names, both, as, allies, providing, soldiers, and, as, enemies, the, term, is, first, used, to, describe, the, tribes, working, together, to, raid, roman, territory, frankish, peoples, subsequently, living, inside, rome, s, frontier, on, the, rhine, river, are, often, divided, by, historians, into, two, groups, the, salian, franks, to, the, west, who, came, south, via, the, rhine, delta, and, the, ripuarian, or, rhineland, franks, to, the, east, who, eventually, conquered, the, roman, frontier, city, of, cologne, and, took, control, of, the, left, bank, of, the, lower, rhine, in, that, region, childeric, i, a, salian, frankish, king, was, one, of, several, military, leaders, commanding, roman, forces, with, various, ethnic, affiliations, in, the, northern, part, of, what, is, now, france, he, and, his, son, clovis, i, founded, the, merovingian, dynasty, which, succeeded, in, unifying, most, of, gaul, under, its, rule, during, the, 6th, century, following, the, collapse, of, the, western, roman, empire, as, well, as, establishing, leadership, over, all, the, frankish, kingdoms, on, or, near, the, rhine, frontier, the, dynasty, subsequently, gained, control, over, a, significant, part, of, what, is, now, western, and, southern, germany, it, was, by, building, upon, the, basis, of, this, merovingian, empire, that, the, subsequent, dynasty, the, carolingians, eventually, came, to, be, seen, as, the, new, emperors, of, western, europe, in, 800, when, charlemagne, was, crowned, by, the, pope, in, 870, the, frankish, realm, came, to, be, permanently, divided, between, western, and, eastern, kingdoms, which, were, the, predecessors, of, the, later, kingdom, of, france, and, holy, roman, empire, respectively, it, is, the, western, kingdom, whose, inhabitants, eventually, came, to, be, known, as, the, french, french, les, fran, ais, german, die, franzosen, dutch, de, fransen, etc, and, this, kingdom, is, the, forerunner, of, the, nation, state, of, france, however, in, various, historical, contexts, such, as, during, the, medieval, crusades, not, only, the, french, but, also, people, from, neighbouring, regions, in, western, europe, continued, to, be, referred, to, collectively, as, franks, the, crusaders, in, particular, had, a, lasting, impact, on, the, use, of, frank, related, names, for, western, europeans, in, many, non, european, languages, the, name, franci, was, not, a, tribal, name, but, within, a, few, centuries, it, had, eclipsed, the, names, of, the, original, peoples, who, constituted, the, frankish, population, following, the, precedents, of, edward, gibbon, and, jacob, grimm, the, name, of, the, franks, has, been, linked, with, the, english, adjective, frank, originally, meaning, free, there, have, also, been, proposals, that, frank, comes, from, the, germanic, word, for, javelin, such, as, in, old, english, franca, or, old, norse, frakka, words, in, other, germanic, languages, meaning, fierce, bold, or, insolent, german, frech, middle, dutch, vrac, old, english, fr, c, and, old, norwegian, frakkr, may, also, be, significant, eumenius, addressed, the, franks, in, the, matter, of, the, execution, of, frankish, prisoners, in, the, circus, at, trier, by, constantine, i, in, 306, and, certain, other, measures, ubi, nunc, est, illa, ferocia, ubi, semper, infida, mobilitas, where, now, is, that, ferocity, of, yours, where, is, that, ever, untrustworthy, fickleness, latin, feroces, was, used, often, to, describe, the, franks, contemporary, definitions, of, frankish, ethnicity, vary, both, by, period, and, point, of, view, the, formulary, of, marculf, written, about, 700, ad, described, a, continuation, of, national, identities, within, a, mixed, population, when, it, stated, that, all, the, peoples, who, dwell, in, the, official, s, province, franks, romans, burgundians, and, those, of, other, nations, live, according, to, their, law, and, their, custom, writing, in, 2009, professor, christopher, wickham, pointed, out, that, the, word, frankish, quickly, ceased, to, have, an, exclusive, ethnic, connotation, north, of, the, river, loire, everyone, seems, to, have, been, considered, a, frank, by, the, mid, 7th, century, at, the, latest, except, bretons, romani, romans, were, essentially, the, inhabitants, of, aquitaine, after, that, apart, from, the, history, of, the, franks, by, gregory, of, tours, two, early, sources, relate, the, mythological, origin, of, the, franks, a, 7th, century, work, known, as, the, chronicle, of, fredegar, and, the, anonymous, liber, historiae, francorum, written, a, century, later, many, say, that, the, franks, originally, came, from, pannonia, and, first, inhabited, the, banks, of, the, rhine, then, they, crossed, the, river, marched, through, thuringia, and, set, up, in, each, county, district, and, each, city, longhaired, kings, chosen, from, their, foremost, and, most, noble, family, the, author, of, the, chronicle, of, fredegar, claimed, that, the, franks, came, originally, from, troy, and, quoted, the, works, of, virgil, and, hieronymus, blessed, jerome, has, written, about, the, ancient, kings, of, the, franks, whose, story, was, first, told, by, the, poet, virgil, their, first, king, was, priam, and, after, troy, was, captured, by, trickery, they, departed, afterwards, they, had, as, king, friga, then, they, split, into, two, parts, the, first, going, into, macedonia, the, second, group, which, left, asia, with, friga, were, called, the, frigii, settled, on, the, banks, of, the, danube, and, the, ocean, sea, again, splitting, into, two, groups, half, of, them, entered, europe, with, their, king, francio, after, crossing, europe, with, their, wives, and, children, they, occupied, the, banks, of, the, rhine, and, not, far, from, the, rhine, began, to, build, the, city, of, troy, colonia, traiana, xanten, according, to, historian, patrick, j, geary, those, two, stories, are, alike, in, betraying, both, the, fact, that, the, franks, knew, little, about, their, background, and, that, they, may, have, felt, some, inferiority, in, comparison, with, other, peoples, of, antiquity, who, possessed, an, ancient, name, and, glorious, tradition, both, legends, are, of, course, equally, fabulous, for, even, more, than, most, barbarian, peoples, the, franks, possessed, no, common, history, ancestry, or, tradition, of, a, heroic, age, of, migration, like, their, alemannic, neighbours, they, were, by, the, sixth, century, a, fairly, recent, creation, a, coalition, of, rhenish, tribal, groups, who, long, maintained, separate, identities, and, institutions, the, other, work, the, liber, historiae, francorum, previously, known, as, gesta, regum, francorum, before, its, republication, in, 1888, by, bruno, krusch, described, how, 12, 000, trojans, led, by, priam, and, antenor, sailed, from, troy, to, the, river, don, in, russia, and, on, to, pannonia, which, is, on, the, river, danube, settling, near, the, sea, of, azov, there, they, founded, a, city, called, sicambria, the, sicambri, were, the, most, well, known, tribe, in, the, frankish, homeland, in, the, time, of, the, early, roman, empire, still, remembered, though, defeated, and, dispersed, long, before, the, frankish, name, appeared, the, trojans, joined, the, roman, army, in, accomplishing, the, task, of, driving, their, enemies, into, the, marshes, of, m, otis, for, which, they, received, the, name, of, franks, meaning, fierce, a, decade, later, the, romans, killed, priam, and, drove, away, marcomer, and, sunno, the, sons, of, priam, and, antenor, and, the, other, franks, the, most, important, contemporary, sources, mentioning, the, early, franks, include, the, panegyrici, latini, ammianus, marcellinus, claudian, zosimus, sidonius, apollinaris, and, gregory, of, tours, the, franks, are, first, mentioned, in, the, augustan, history, a, collection, of, biographies, of, the, roman, emperors, none, of, these, sources, presents, a, detailed, list, of, which, tribes, or, parts, of, tribes, became, frankish, or, concerning, the, politics, and, history, but, to, quote, james, 1988, p, 35, the, franks, were, described, in, roman, texts, both, as, allies, laeti, and, enemies, dediticii, about, the, year, 260, one, group, of, franks, penetrated, as, far, as, tarragona, in, present, day, spain, where, they, plagued, the, region, for, about, a, decade, before, they, were, subdued, and, expelled, by, the, romans, in, 287, or, 288, the, roman, caesar, maximian, forced, a, frankish, leader, genobaud, and, his, people, to, surrender, without, a, fight, in, 288, the, emperor, maximian, defeated, the, salian, franks, chamavi, frisii, and, other, germanic, people, living, along, the, rhine, and, moved, them, to, germania, inferior, to, provide, manpower, and, prevent, the, settlement, of, other, germanic, tribes, in, 292, constantius, the, father, of, constantine, i, defeated, the, franks, who, had, settled, at, the, mouth, of, the, rhine, these, were, moved, to, the, nearby, region, of, toxandria, eumenius, mentions, constantius, as, having, killed, expelled, captured, kidnapped, the, franks, who, had, settled, there, and, others, who, had, crossed, the, rhine, using, the, term, nationes, franciae, for, the, first, time, it, seems, likely, that, the, term, frank, in, this, first, period, had, a, broader, meaning, sometimes, including, coastal, frisii, the, life, of, aurelian, which, was, possibly, written, by, vopiscus, mentions, that, in, 328, frankish, raiders, were, captured, by, the, 6th, legion, stationed, at, mainz, as, a, result, of, this, incident, 700, franks, were, killed, and, 300, were, sold, into, slavery, frankish, incursions, over, the, rhine, became, so, frequent, that, the, romans, began, to, settle, the, franks, on, their, borders, in, order, to, control, them, the, franks, appear, to, be, mentioned, in, the, tabula, peutingeriana, an, atlas, of, roman, roads, it, is, a, 13th, century, copy, of, a, 4th, or, 5th, century, document, that, reflects, information, from, the, 3rd, century, several, tribal, names, are, written, at, the, mouth, of, the, rhine, one, of, these, says, hamavi, quietpranci, which, is, generally, believed, to, mean, the, chamavi, who, are, franks, despite, the, letter, p, further, up, the, river, the, word, francia, is, clearly, marked, indicating, a, country, name, on, the, bank, opposite, to, nijmegen, and, xanten, the, salians, were, first, mentioned, by, ammianus, marcellinus, who, described, julian, s, defeat, of, the, first, franks, of, all, those, whom, custom, has, called, the, salians, in, 358, julian, allowed, the, franks, to, remain, in, texuandria, as, f, derati, within, the, empire, having, moved, there, from, the, rhine, maas, delta, the, 5th, century, notitia, dignitatum, lists, a, group, of, soldiers, as, salii, some, decades, later, franks, in, the, same, region, possibly, the, salians, controlled, the, river, scheldt, and, were, disrupting, transport, links, to, britain, in, the, english, channel, although, roman, forces, managed, to, pacify, them, they, failed, to, expel, the, franks, who, continued, to, be, feared, as, pirates, the, salians, are, generally, seen, as, the, predecessors, of, the, franks, who, pushed, southwestwards, into, what, is, now, modern, france, who, eventually, came, to, be, ruled, by, the, merovingians, see, below, this, is, because, when, the, merovingian, dynasty, published, the, salian, law, lex, salica, it, applied, in, the, neustrian, area, from, the, river, liger, loire, to, the, silva, carbonaria, the, western, kingdom, founded, by, them, outside, the, original, area, of, frankish, settlement, in, the, 5th, century, franks, under, chlodio, pushed, into, roman, lands, in, and, beyond, the, silva, carbonaria, or, charcoal, forest, which, ran, through, the, area, of, modern, western, wallonia, the, forest, was, the, boundary, of, the, original, salian, territories, to, the, north, and, the, more, romanized, area, to, the, south, in, the, roman, province, of, belgica, secunda, which, now, lies, in, northern, france, chlodio, conquered, tournai, artois, cambrai, and, as, far, as, the, somme, river, chlodio, is, often, seen, as, an, ancestor, of, the, future, merovingian, dynasty, childeric, i, who, according, to, gregory, of, tours, was, a, reputed, descendant, of, chlodio, was, later, seen, as, administrative, ruler, over, roman, belgica, secunda, and, possibly, other, areas, records, of, childeric, show, him, to, have, been, active, together, with, roman, forces, in, the, loire, region, quite, far, to, the, south, his, descendants, came, to, rule, roman, gaul, all, the, way, to, there, and, this, became, the, frankish, kingdom, of, neustria, the, basis, of, what, would, become, medieval, france, childeric, s, son, clovis, i, also, took, control, of, the, more, independent, frankish, kingdoms, east, of, the, silva, carbonaria, and, belgica, ii, this, later, became, the, frankish, kingdom, of, austrasia, where, the, early, legal, code, was, referred, to, as, ripuarian, the, rhineland, franks, who, lived, near, the, stretch, of, the, rhine, from, roughly, mainz, to, duisburg, the, region, of, the, city, of, cologne, are, often, considered, separately, from, the, salians, and, sometimes, in, modern, texts, referred, to, as, ripuarian, franks, the, ravenna, cosmography, suggests, that, francia, renensis, included, the, old, civitas, of, the, ubii, in, germania, ii, germania, inferior, but, also, the, northern, part, of, germania, i, germania, superior, including, mainz, like, the, salians, they, appear, in, roman, records, both, as, raiders, and, as, contributors, to, military, units, unlike, the, salii, there, is, no, record, of, when, if, ever, the, empire, officially, accepted, their, residence, within, its, borders, they, eventually, succeeded, to, hold, the, city, of, cologne, and, at, some, point, seem, to, have, acquired, the, name, ripuarians, which, may, have, meant, river, people, in, any, case, a, merovingian, legal, code, was, called, the, lex, ribuaria, but, it, probably, applied, in, all, the, older, frankish, lands, including, the, original, salian, areas, jordanes, in, his, getica, mentions, a, group, called, the, riparii, as, auxiliaries, of, flavius, aetius, during, the, battle, of, ch, lons, in, 451, and, distinct, from, the, franci, hi, enim, affuerunt, auxiliares, franci, sarmatae, armoriciani, liticiani, burgundiones, saxones, riparii, olibriones, but, these, riparii, river, dwellers, are, today, not, considered, to, be, ripuarian, franks, but, rather, a, known, military, unit, based, on, the, rh, ne, the, ripuarian, territory, on, both, sides, of, the, rhine, thus, became, a, central, part, of, merovingian, austrasia, this, stretched, to, include, roman, germania, inferior, later, germania, secunda, which, included, the, original, salian, and, ripuarian, lands, and, roughly, equates, to, medieval, lower, lotharingia, it, also, included, gallia, belgica, prima, roughly, medieval, upper, lotharingia, and, further, lands, on, the, east, bank, of, the, rhine, gregory, of, tours, book, ii, reported, that, small, frankish, kingdoms, existed, during, the, fifth, century, around, cologne, tournai, cambrai, and, elsewhere, the, kingdom, of, the, merovingians, eventually, came, to, dominate, the, others, possibly, because, of, its, association, with, roman, power, structures, in, northern, gaul, into, which, the, frankish, military, forces, were, apparently, integrated, to, some, extent, in, the, 450s, and, 460s, childeric, i, a, salian, frank, was, one, of, several, military, leaders, commanding, roman, forces, with, various, ethnic, affiliations, in, roman, gaul, roughly, modern, france, childeric, and, his, son, clovis, i, faced, competition, from, the, roman, aegidius, as, competitor, for, the, kingship, of, the, franks, associated, with, the, roman, loire, forces, according, to, gregory, of, tours, aegidius, held, the, kingship, of, the, franks, for, 8, years, while, childeric, was, in, exile, this, new, type, of, kingship, perhaps, inspired, by, alaric, i, represents, the, start, of, the, merovingian, dynasty, which, succeeded, in, conquering, most, of, gaul, in, the, 6th, century, as, well, as, establishing, its, leadership, over, all, the, frankish, kingdoms, on, the, rhine, frontier, aegidius, died, in, 464, or, 465, childeric, and, his, son, clovis, i, were, both, described, as, rulers, of, the, roman, province, of, belgica, secunda, by, its, spiritual, leader, in, the, time, of, clovis, saint, remigius, clovis, later, defeated, the, son, of, aegidius, syagrius, in, 486, or, 487, and, then, had, the, frankish, king, chararic, imprisoned, and, executed, a, few, years, later, he, killed, ragnachar, the, frankish, king, of, cambrai, and, his, brothers, after, conquering, the, kingdom, of, soissons, and, expelling, the, visigoths, from, southern, gaul, at, the, battle, of, vouill, he, established, frankish, hegemony, over, most, of, gaul, excluding, burgundy, provence, and, brittany, which, were, eventually, absorbed, by, his, successors, by, the, 490s, he, had, conquered, all, the, frankish, kingdoms, to, the, west, of, the, river, maas, except, for, the, ripuarian, franks, and, was, in, a, position, to, make, the, city, of, paris, his, capital, he, became, the, first, king, of, all, franks, in, 509, after, he, had, conquered, cologne, clovis, i, divided, his, realm, between, his, four, sons, who, united, to, defeat, burgundy, in, 534, internecine, feuding, occurred, during, the, reigns, of, the, brothers, sigebert, i, and, chilperic, i, which, was, largely, fuelled, by, the, rivalry, of, their, queens, brunhilda, and, fredegunda, and, which, continued, during, the, reigns, of, their, sons, and, their, grandsons, three, distinct, subkingdoms, emerged, austrasia, neustria, and, burgundy, each, of, which, developed, independently, and, sought, to, exert, influence, over, the, others, the, influence, of, the, arnulfing, clan, of, austrasia, ensured, that, the, political, centre, of, gravity, in, the, kingdom, gradually, shifted, eastwards, to, the, rhineland, the, frankish, realm, was, reunited, in, 613, by, chlothar, ii, the, son, of, chilperic, who, granted, his, nobles, the, edict, of, paris, in, an, effort, to, reduce, corruption, and, reassert, his, authority, following, the, military, successes, of, his, son, and, successor, dagobert, i, royal, authority, rapidly, declined, under, a, series, of, kings, traditionally, known, as, les, rois, fain, ants, after, the, battle, of, tertry, in, 687, each, mayor, of, the, palace, who, had, formerly, been, the, king, s, chief, household, official, effectively, held, power, until, in, 751, with, the, approval, of, the, pope, and, the, nobility, pepin, the, short, deposed, the, last, merovingian, king, childeric, iii, and, had, himself, crowned, this, inaugurated, a, new, dynasty, the, carolingians, the, unification, achieved, by, the, merovingians, ensured, the, continuation, of, what, has, become, known, as, the, carolingian, renaissance, the, carolingian, empire, was, beset, by, internecine, warfare, but, the, combination, of, frankish, rule, and, roman, christianity, ensured, that, it, was, fundamentally, united, frankish, government, and, culture, depended, very, much, upon, each, ruler, and, his, aims, and, so, each, region, of, the, empire, developed, differently, although, a, ruler, s, aims, depended, upon, the, political, alliances, of, his, family, the, leading, families, of, francia, shared, the, same, basic, beliefs, and, ideas, of, government, which, had, both, roman, and, germanic, roots, the, frankish, state, consolidated, its, hold, over, the, majority, of, western, europe, by, the, end, of, the, 8th, century, developing, into, the, carolingian, empire, with, the, coronation, of, their, ruler, charlemagne, as, holy, roman, emperor, by, pope, leo, iii, in, 800, ad, he, and, his, successors, were, recognised, as, legitimate, successors, to, the, emperors, of, the, western, roman, empire, as, such, the, carolingian, empire, gradually, came, to, be, seen, in, the, west, as, a, continuation, of, the, ancient, roman, empire, this, empire, would, give, rise, to, several, successor, states, including, france, the, holy, roman, empire, and, burgundy, though, the, frankish, identity, remained, most, closely, identified, with, france, after, the, death, of, charlemagne, his, only, adult, surviving, son, became, emperor, and, king, louis, the, pious, following, louis, the, pious, s, death, however, according, to, frankish, culture, and, law, that, demanded, equality, among, all, living, male, adult, heirs, the, frankish, empire, was, now, split, between, louis, three, sons, germanic, peoples, including, those, tribes, in, the, rhine, delta, that, later, became, the, franks, are, known, to, have, served, in, the, roman, army, since, the, days, of, julius, caesar, after, the, roman, administration, collapsed, in, gaul, in, the, 260s, the, armies, under, the, germanic, batavian, postumus, revolted, and, proclaimed, him, emperor, and, then, restored, order, from, then, on, germanic, soldiers, in, the, roman, army, most, notably, franks, were, promoted, from, the, ranks, a, few, decades, later, the, menapian, carausius, created, a, batavian, british, rump, state, on, roman, soil, that, was, supported, by, frankish, soldiers, and, raiders, frankish, soldiers, such, as, magnentius, silvanus, ricomer, and, bauto, held, command, positions, in, the, roman, army, during, the, mid, 4th, century, from, the, narrative, of, ammianus, marcellinus, it, is, evident, that, both, frankish, and, alamannic, tribal, armies, were, organised, along, roman, lines, after, the, invasion, of, chlodio, the, roman, armies, at, the, rhine, border, became, a, frankish, franchise, and, franks, were, known, to, levy, roman, like, troops, that, were, supported, by, a, roman, like, armour, and, weapons, industry, this, lasted, at, least, until, the, days, of, the, scholar, procopius, c, 500, c, 565, more, than, a, century, after, the, demise, of, the, western, roman, empire, who, wrote, describing, the, former, arborychoi, having, merged, with, the, franks, retaining, their, legionary, organization, in, the, style, of, their, forefathers, during, roman, times, the, franks, under, the, merovingians, melded, germanic, custom, with, romanised, organisation, and, several, important, tactical, innovations, before, their, conquest, of, gaul, the, franks, fought, primarily, as, a, tribe, unless, they, were, part, of, a, roman, military, unit, fighting, in, conjunction, with, other, imperial, units, the, primary, sources, for, frankish, military, custom, and, armament, are, ammianus, marcellinus, agathias, and, procopius, the, latter, two, eastern, roman, historians, writing, about, frankish, intervention, in, the, gothic, war, writing, of, 539, procopius, says, at, this, time, the, franks, hearing, that, both, the, goths, and, romans, had, suffered, severely, by, the, war, forgetting, for, the, moment, their, oaths, and, treaties, for, this, nation, in, matters, of, trust, is, the, most, treacherous, in, the, world, they, straightway, gathered, to, the, number, of, one, hundred, thousand, under, the, leadership, of, theudebert, i, and, marched, into, italy, they, had, a, small, body, of, cavalry, about, their, leader, and, these, were, the, only, ones, armed, with, spears, while, all, the, rest, were, foot, soldiers, having, neither, bows, nor, spears, but, each, man, carried, a, sword, and, shield, and, one, axe, now, the, iron, head, of, this, weapon, was, thick, and, exceedingly, sharp, on, both, sides, while, the, wooden, handle, was, very, short, and, they, are, accustomed, always, to, throw, these, axes, at, a, signal, in, the, first, charge, and, thus, to, shatter, the, shields, of, the, enemy, and, kill, the, men, his, contemporary, agathias, who, based, his, own, writings, upon, the, tropes, laid, down, by, procopius, says, the, military, equipment, of, this, people, is, very, simple, they, do, not, know, the, use, of, the, coat, of, mail, or, greaves, and, the, majority, leave, the, head, uncovered, only, a, few, wear, the, helmet, they, have, their, chests, bare, and, backs, naked, to, the, loins, they, cover, their, thighs, with, either, leather, or, linen, they, do, not, serve, on, horseback, except, in, very, rare, cases, fighting, on, foot, is, both, habitual, and, a, national, custom, and, they, are, proficient, in, this, at, the, hip, they, wear, a, sword, and, on, the, left, side, their, shield, is, attached, they, have, neither, bows, nor, slings, no, missile, weapons, except, the, double, edged, axe, and, the, angon, which, they, use, most, often, the, angons, are, spears, which, are, neither, very, short, nor, very, long, they, can, be, used, if, necessary, for, throwing, like, a, javelin, and, also, in, hand, to, hand, combat, in, the, strategikon, supposedly, written, by, the, emperor, maurice, or, in, his, time, the, franks, are, lumped, together, with, the, lombards, under, the, heading, of, the, fair, haired, peoples, if, they, are, hard, pressed, in, cavalry, actions, they, dismount, at, a, single, prearranged, sign, and, line, up, on, foot, although, only, a, few, against, many, horsemen, they, do, not, shrink, from, the, fight, they, are, armed, with, shields, lances, and, short, swords, slung, from, their, shoulders, they, prefer, fighting, on, foot, and, rapid, charges, either, on, horseback, or, on, foot, they, are, impetuous, and, un, disciplined, in, charging, as, if, they, were, the, only, people, in, the, world, who, are, not, cowards, while, the, above, quotations, have, been, used, as, a, statement, of, the, military, practices, of, the, frankish, nation, in, the, 6th, century, and, have, even, been, extrapolated, to, the, entire, period, preceding, charles, martel, s, reforms, early, mid, 8th, century, post, second, world, war, historiography, has, emphasised, the, inherited, roman, characteristics, of, the, frankish, military, from, the, date, of, the, beginning, of, the, conquest, of, gaul, the, byzantine, authors, present, several, contradictions, and, difficulties, procopius, denies, the, franks, the, use, of, the, spear, while, agathias, makes, it, one, of, their, primary, weapons, they, agree, that, the, franks, were, primarily, infantrymen, threw, axes, and, carried, a, sword, and, shield, both, writers, also, contradict, the, authority, of, gallic, authors, of, the, same, general, time, period, sidonius, apollinaris, and, gregory, of, tours, and, the, archaeological, evidence, the, lex, ribuaria, the, early, 7th, century, legal, code, of, the, rhineland, or, ripuarian, franks, specifies, the, values, of, various, goods, when, paying, a, wergild, in, kind, whereas, a, spear, and, shield, were, worth, only, two, solidi, a, sword, and, scabbard, were, valued, at, seven, a, helmet, at, six, and, a, metal, tunic, at, twelve, scramasaxes, and, arrowheads, are, numerous, in, frankish, graves, even, though, the, byzantine, historians, do, not, assign, them, to, the, franks, the, evidence, of, gregory, and, of, the, lex, salica, implies, that, the, early, franks, were, a, cavalry, people, in, fact, some, modern, historians, have, hypothesised, that, the, franks, possessed, so, numerous, a, body, of, horses, that, they, could, use, them, to, plough, fields, and, thus, were, agriculturally, technologically, advanced, over, their, neighbours, the, lex, ribuaria, specifies, that, a, mare, s, value, was, the, same, as, that, of, an, ox, or, of, a, shield, and, spear, two, solidi, and, a, stallion, seven, or, the, same, as, a, sword, and, scabbard, which, suggests, that, horses, were, relatively, common, perhaps, the, byzantine, writers, considered, the, frankish, horse, to, be, insignificant, relative, to, the, greek, cavalry, which, is, probably, accurate, the, frankish, military, establishment, incorporated, many, of, the, pre, existing, roman, institutions, in, gaul, especially, during, and, after, the, conquests, of, clovis, i, in, the, late, 5th, and, early, 6th, centuries, frankish, military, strategy, revolved, around, the, holding, and, taking, of, fortified, centres, castra, and, in, general, these, centres, were, held, by, garrisons, of, milities, and, laeti, who, were, descendants, of, roman, soldiers, with, germanic, origin, granted, a, quasi, national, status, under, frankish, law, these, milites, continued, to, be, commanded, by, tribunes, throughout, gaul, the, descendants, of, roman, soldiers, continued, to, wear, their, uniforms, and, perform, their, ceremonial, duties, immediately, beneath, the, frankish, king, in, the, military, hierarchy, were, the, leudes, his, sworn, followers, who, were, generally, old, soldiers, in, service, away, from, court, the, king, had, an, elite, bodyguard, called, the, truste, members, of, the, truste, often, served, in, centannae, garrison, settlements, that, were, established, for, military, and, police, purposes, the, day, to, day, bodyguard, of, the, king, was, made, up, of, antrustiones, senior, soldiers, who, were, aristocrats, in, military, service, and, pueri, junior, soldiers, and, not, aristocrats, all, high, ranking, men, had, pueri, the, frankish, military, was, not, composed, solely, of, franks, and, gallo, romans, but, also, contained, saxons, alans, taifals, and, alemanni, after, the, conquest, of, burgundy, 534, the, well, organised, military, institutions, of, that, kingdom, were, integrated, into, the, frankish, realm, chief, among, these, was, the, standing, army, under, the, command, of, the, patrician, of, burgundy, in, the, late, 6th, century, during, the, wars, instigated, by, fredegund, and, brunhilda, the, merovingian, monarchs, introduced, a, new, element, into, their, militaries, the, local, levy, a, levy, consisted, of, all, the, able, bodied, men, of, a, district, who, were, required, to, report, for, military, service, when, called, upon, similar, to, conscription, the, local, levy, applied, only, to, a, city, and, its, environs, initially, only, in, certain, cities, in, western, gaul, in, neustria, and, aquitaine, did, the, kings, possess, the, right, or, power, to, call, up, the, levy, the, commanders, of, the, local, levies, were, always, different, from, the, commanders, of, the, urban, garrisons, often, the, former, were, commanded, by, the, counts, of, the, districts, a, much, rarer, occurrence, was, the, general, levy, which, applied, to, the, entire, kingdom, and, included, peasants, pauperes, and, inferiores, general, levies, could, also, be, made, within, the, still, pagan, trans, rhenish, stem, duchies, on, the, orders, of, a, monarch, the, saxons, alemanni, and, thuringii, all, had, the, institution, of, the, levy, and, the, frankish, monarchs, could, depend, upon, their, levies, until, the, mid, 7th, century, when, the, stem, dukes, began, to, sever, their, ties, to, the, monarchy, radulf, of, thuringia, called, up, the, levy, for, a, war, against, sigebert, iii, in, 640, soon, the, local, levy, spread, to, austrasia, and, the, less, romanised, regions, of, gaul, on, an, intermediate, level, the, kings, began, calling, up, territorial, levies, from, the, regions, of, austrasia, which, did, not, have, major, cities, of, roman, origin, all, the, forms, of, the, levy, gradually, disappeared, however, in, the, course, of, the, 7th, century, after, the, reign, of, dagobert, i, under, the, so, called, rois, fain, ants, the, levies, disappeared, by, mid, century, in, austrasia, and, later, in, burgundy, and, neustria, only, in, aquitaine, which, was, fast, becoming, independent, of, the, central, frankish, monarchy, did, complex, military, institutions, persist, into, the, 8th, century, in, the, final, half, of, the, 7th, century, and, first, half, of, the, 8th, in, merovingian, gaul, the, chief, military, actors, became, the, lay, and, ecclesiastical, magnates, with, their, bands, of, armed, followers, called, retainers, the, other, aspects, of, the, merovingian, military, mostly, roman, in, origin, or, innovations, of, powerful, kings, disappeared, from, the, scene, by, the, 8th, century, merovingian, armies, used, coats, of, mail, helmets, shields, lances, swords, bows, and, arrows, and, war, horses, the, armament, of, private, armies, resembled, those, of, the, gallo, roman, potentiatores, of, the, late, empire, a, strong, element, of, alanic, cavalry, settled, in, armorica, influenced, the, fighting, style, of, the, bretons, down, into, the, 12th, century, local, urban, levies, could, be, reasonably, well, armed, and, even, mounted, but, the, more, general, levies, were, composed, of, pauperes, and, inferiores, who, were, mostly, farmers, by, trade, and, carried, ineffective, weapons, such, as, farming, implements, the, peoples, east, of, the, rhine, franks, saxons, and, even, wends, who, were, sometimes, called, upon, to, serve, wore, rudimentary, armour, and, carried, weapons, such, as, spears, and, axes, few, of, these, men, were, mounted, merovingian, society, had, a, militarised, nature, the, franks, called, annual, meetings, every, marchfeld, 1, march, when, the, king, and, his, nobles, assembled, in, large, open, fields, and, determined, their, targets, for, the, next, campaigning, season, the, meetings, were, a, show, of, strength, on, behalf, of, the, monarch, and, a, way, for, him, to, retain, loyalty, among, his, troops, in, their, civil, wars, the, merovingian, kings, concentrated, on, the, holding, of, fortified, places, and, the, use, of, siege, engines, in, wars, waged, against, external, foes, the, objective, was, typically, the, acquisition, of, booty, or, the, enforcement, of, tribute, only, in, the, lands, beyond, the, rhine, did, the, merovingians, seek, to, extend, political, control, over, their, neighbours, tactically, the, merovingians, borrowed, heavily, from, the, romans, especially, regarding, siege, warfare, their, battle, tactics, were, highly, flexible, and, were, designed, to, meet, the, specific, circumstances, of, a, battle, the, tactic, of, subterfuge, was, employed, endlessly, cavalry, formed, a, large, segment, of, an, army, but, troops, readily, dismounted, to, fight, on, foot, the, merovingians, were, capable, of, raising, naval, forces, the, naval, campaign, waged, against, the, danes, by, theuderic, i, in, 515, involved, ocean, worthy, ships, and, rivercraft, were, used, on, the, loire, rh, ne, and, rhine, in, a, modern, linguistic, context, the, language, of, the, early, franks, is, variously, called, old, frankish, or, old, franconian, and, these, terms, refer, to, the, language, of, the, franks, prior, to, the, advent, of, the, high, german, consonant, shift, which, took, place, between, 600, and, 700, ad, after, this, consonant, shift, the, frankish, dialect, diverges, with, the, dialects, which, would, become, modern, dutch, not, undergoing, the, consonantal, shift, while, all, others, did, so, to, varying, degrees, as, a, result, the, distinction, between, old, dutch, and, old, frankish, is, largely, negligible, with, old, dutch, also, called, old, low, franconian, being, the, term, used, to, differentiate, between, the, affected, and, non, affected, variants, following, the, aforementioned, second, germanic, consonant, shift, the, frankish, language, has, not, been, directly, attested, apart, from, a, very, small, number, of, runic, inscriptions, found, within, contemporary, frankish, territory, such, as, the, bergakker, inscription, nevertheless, a, significant, amount, of, frankish, vocabulary, has, been, reconstructed, by, examining, early, germanic, loanwords, found, in, old, french, as, well, as, through, comparative, reconstruction, through, dutch, the, influence, of, old, frankish, on, contemporary, gallo, roman, vocabulary, and, phonology, have, long, been, questions, of, scholarly, debate, frankish, influence, is, thought, to, include, the, designations, of, the, four, cardinal, directions, nord, north, sud, south, est, east, and, ouest, west, and, at, least, an, additional, 1000, stem, words, although, the, franks, would, eventually, conquer, all, of, gaul, speakers, of, frankish, apparently, expanded, in, sufficient, numbers, only, into, northern, gaul, to, have, a, linguistic, effect, for, several, centuries, northern, gaul, was, a, bilingual, territory, vulgar, latin, and, frankish, the, language, used, in, writing, in, government, and, by, the, church, was, latin, urban, t, holmes, has, proposed, that, a, germanic, language, continued, to, be, spoken, as, a, second, tongue, by, public, officials, in, western, austrasia, and, northern, neustria, as, late, as, the, 850s, and, that, it, completely, disappeared, as, a, spoken, language, during, the, 10th, century, from, regions, where, only, french, is, spoken, today, the, germanic, tribes, who, were, called, franks, in, late, antiquity, are, associated, with, the, weser, rhine, germanic, istvaeonic, cultural, linguistic, grouping, early, frankish, art, and, architecture, belongs, to, a, phase, known, as, migration, period, art, which, has, left, very, few, remains, the, later, period, is, called, carolingian, art, or, especially, in, architecture, pre, romanesque, very, little, merovingian, architecture, has, been, preserved, the, earliest, churches, seem, to, have, been, timber, built, with, larger, examples, being, of, a, basilica, type, the, most, completely, surviving, example, a, baptistery, in, poitiers, is, a, building, with, three, apses, of, a, gallo, roman, style, a, number, of, small, baptistries, can, be, seen, in, southern, france, as, these, fell, out, of, fashion, they, were, not, updated, and, have, subsequently, survived, as, they, were, jewelry, such, as, brooches, weapons, including, swords, with, decorative, hilts, and, clothing, such, as, capes, and, sandals, have, been, found, in, a, number, of, grave, sites, the, grave, of, queen, aregund, discovered, in, 1959, and, the, treasure, of, gourdon, which, was, deposited, soon, after, 524, are, notable, examples, the, few, merovingian, illuminated, manuscripts, that, have, survived, such, as, the, gelasian, sacramentary, contain, a, great, deal, of, zoomorphic, representations, such, frankish, objects, show, a, greater, use, of, the, style, and, motifs, of, late, antiquity, and, a, lesser, degree, of, skill, and, sophistication, in, design, and, manufacture, than, comparable, works, from, the, british, isles, so, little, has, survived, however, that, the, best, quality, of, work, from, this, period, may, not, be, represented, the, objects, produced, by, the, main, centres, of, the, carolingian, renaissance, which, represent, a, transformation, from, that, of, the, earlier, period, have, survived, in, far, greater, quantity, the, arts, were, lavishly, funded, and, encouraged, by, charlemagne, using, imported, artists, where, necessary, and, carolingian, developments, were, decisive, for, the, future, course, of, western, art, carolingian, illuminated, manuscripts, and, ivory, plaques, which, have, survived, in, reasonable, numbers, approached, those, of, constantinople, in, quality, the, main, surviving, monument, of, carolingian, architecture, is, the, palatine, chapel, in, aachen, which, is, an, impressive, and, confident, adaptation, of, san, vitale, ravenna, from, where, some, of, the, pillars, were, brought, many, other, important, buildings, existed, such, as, the, monasteries, of, centula, or, st, gall, or, the, old, cologne, cathedral, since, rebuilt, these, large, structures, and, complexes, made, frequent, use, of, towers, a, sizeable, portion, of, the, frankish, aristocracy, quickly, followed, clovis, in, converting, to, christianity, the, frankish, church, of, the, merovingians, the, conversion, of, all, under, frankish, rule, required, a, considerable, amount, of, time, and, effort, echoes, of, frankish, paganism, can, be, found, in, the, primary, sources, but, their, meaning, is, not, always, clear, interpretations, by, modern, scholars, differ, greatly, but, it, is, likely, that, frankish, paganism, shared, most, of, the, characteristics, of, other, varieties, of, germanic, paganism, the, mythology, of, the, franks, was, probably, a, form, of, germanic, polytheism, it, was, highly, ritualistic, many, daily, activities, centred, around, the, multiple, deities, chiefest, of, which, may, have, been, the, quinotaur, a, water, god, from, whom, the, merovingians, were, reputed, to, have, derived, their, ancestry, most, of, their, gods, were, linked, with, local, cult, centres, and, their, sacred, character, and, power, were, associated, with, specific, regions, outside, of, which, they, were, neither, worshipped, nor, feared, most, of, the, gods, were, worldly, possessing, form, and, having, connections, with, specific, objects, in, contrast, to, the, god, of, christianity, frankish, paganism, has, been, observed, in, the, burial, site, of, childeric, i, where, the, king, s, body, was, found, covered, in, a, cloth, decorated, with, numerous, bees, there, is, a, likely, connection, with, the, bees, to, the, traditional, frankish, weapon, the, angon, meaning, sting, from, its, distinctive, spearhead, it, is, possible, that, the, fleur, de, lis, is, derived, from, the, angon, some, franks, like, the, 4th, century, usurper, silvanus, converted, early, to, christianity, in, 496, clovis, i, who, had, married, a, burgundian, catholic, named, clotilda, in, 493, was, baptised, by, saint, remi, after, a, decisive, victory, over, the, alemanni, at, the, battle, of, tolbiac, according, to, gregory, of, tours, over, three, thousand, of, his, soldiers, were, baptised, with, him, clovis, conversion, had, a, profound, effect, on, the, course, of, european, history, for, at, the, time, the, franks, were, the, only, major, christianised, germanic, tribe, without, a, predominantly, arian, aristocracy, and, this, led, to, a, naturally, amicable, relationship, between, the, catholic, church, and, the, increasingly, powerful, franks, although, many, of, the, frankish, aristocracy, quickly, followed, clovis, in, converting, to, christianity, the, conversion, of, all, his, subjects, was, only, achieved, after, considerable, effort, and, in, some, regions, a, period, of, over, two, centuries, the, chronicle, of, st, denis, relates, that, following, clovis, conversion, a, number, of, pagans, who, were, unhappy, with, this, turn, of, events, rallied, around, ragnachar, who, had, played, an, important, role, in, clovis, initial, rise, to, power, although, the, text, remains, unclear, as, to, the, precise, pretext, clovis, had, ragnachar, executed, remaining, pockets, of, resistance, were, overcome, region, by, region, primarily, due, to, the, work, of, an, expanding, network, of, monasteries, the, merovingian, church, was, shaped, by, both, internal, and, external, forces, it, had, to, come, to, terms, with, an, established, gallo, roman, hierarchy, that, resisted, changes, to, its, culture, christianise, pagan, sensibilities, and, suppress, their, expression, provide, a, new, theological, basis, for, merovingian, forms, of, kingship, deeply, rooted, in, pagan, germanic, tradition, and, accommodate, irish, and, anglo, saxon, missionary, activities, and, papal, requirements, the, carolingian, reformation, of, monasticism, and, church, state, relations, was, the, culmination, of, the, frankish, church, the, increasingly, wealthy, merovingian, elite, endowed, many, monasteries, including, that, of, the, irish, missionary, columbanus, the, 5th, 6th, and, 7th, centuries, saw, two, major, waves, of, hermitism, in, the, frankish, world, which, led, to, legislation, requiring, that, all, monks, and, hermits, follow, the, rule, of, st, benedict, the, church, sometimes, had, an, uneasy, relationship, with, the, merovingian, kings, whose, claim, to, rule, depended, on, a, mystique, of, royal, descent, and, who, tended, to, revert, to, the, polygamy, of, their, pagan, ancestors, rome, encouraged, the, franks, to, slowly, replace, the, gallican, rite, with, the, roman, rite, as, with, other, germanic, peoples, the, laws, of, the, franks, were, memorised, by, rachimburgs, who, were, analogous, to, the, lawspeakers, of, scandinavia, by, the, 6th, century, when, these, laws, first, appeared, in, written, form, two, basic, legal, subdivisions, existed, salian, franks, were, subject, to, salic, law, and, ripuarian, franks, to, ripuarian, law, gallo, romans, south, of, the, river, loire, and, the, clergy, remained, subject, to, traditional, roman, law, germanic, law, was, overwhelmingly, concerned, with, the, protection, of, individuals, and, less, concerned, with, protecting, the, interests, of, the, state, according, to, michel, rouche, frankish, judges, devoted, as, much, care, to, a, case, involving, the, theft, of, a, dog, as, roman, judges, did, to, cases, involving, the, fiscal, responsibility, of, curiales, or, municipal, councilors, the, term, frank, has, been, used, by, many, of, the, eastern, orthodox, and, muslim, neighbours, of, medieval, latin, christendom, and, beyond, such, as, in, asia, as, a, general, synonym, for, a, european, from, western, and, central, europe, areas, that, followed, the, latin, rites, of, christianity, under, the, authority, of, the, pope, in, rome, another, term, with, similar, use, was, latins, christians, following, the, latin, rites, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, in, this, period, were, called, franks, or, latins, regardless, of, their, country, of, origin, whereas, the, words, rhomaios, and, r, mi, roman, were, used, for, orthodox, christians, on, a, number, of, greek, islands, catholics, are, still, referred, to, as, frangoi, or, franks, for, instance, on, syros, where, they, are, called, frangosyrianoi, the, period, of, crusader, rule, in, greek, lands, is, known, to, this, day, as, the, frankokratia, rule, of, the, franks, the, mediterranean, lingua, franca, or, frankish, language, was, a, pidgin, first, spoken, by, 11th, century, european, christians, and, muslims, in, mediterranean, ports, that, remained, in, use, until, the, 19th, century, the, term, frangistan, land, of, the, franks, was, used, by, muslims, to, refer, to, christian, europe, and, was, commonly, used, over, several, centuries, in, iberia, north, africa, and, the, middle, east, persianate, turkic, dynasties, used, and, spread, the, term, in, throughout, iran, and, india, with, the, expansion, of, the, language, during, the, mongol, empire, in, the, 13th, 14th, centuries, the, mongols, used, the, term, franks, to, designate, europeans, and, this, usage, continued, into, mughal, times, in, india, in, the, form, of, the, word, firangi, the, chinese, called, the, portuguese, folangji, franks, in, the, 1520s, at, the, battle, of, tunmen, and, battle, of, xicaowan, some, other, varieties, of, mandarin, chinese, pronounced, the, characters, as, fah, lan, ki, during, the, reign, of, chingtih, zhengde, 1506, foreigners, from,

reported, at, court, and, an, order, returned, to, drive, them, away, immediately, and, stop, the, trade, examples, of, derived, words, include, in, the, thai, usage, the, word, can, refer, to, any, european, person, when, the, presence, of, us, soldiers, during, the, vietnam, war, placed, thai, people, in, contact, with, african, americans, they, and, people, of, african, ancestry, in, general, came, to, be, called, farang, dam, black, farang, such, words, sometimes, also, connote, things, plants, or, creatures, introduced, by, europeans, franks, for, example, in, khmer, m, n, barang, literally, french, chicken, refers, to, a, turkey, and, in, thai, farang, is, the, name, both, for, europeans, and, for, the, guava, fruit, introduced, by, portuguese, traders, over, 400, years, ago, in, contemporary, israel, the, yiddish, word, frenk, has, by, a, curious, etymological, development, come, to, refer, to, mizrahi, jews, in, modern, hebrew, and, carries, a, strong, pejorative, connotation, some, linguists, among, them, drs, jan, tent, and, paul, geraghty, have, suggested, that, the, samoan, and, generic, polynesian, term, for, europeans, palagi, pronounced, puh, lang, ee, or, papalagi, might, also, be, cognate, possibly, a, loan, term, gathered, by, early, contact, between, pacific, islanders, and, malays
