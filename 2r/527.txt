of, opposing, the, vi, t, minh, politically, with, an, alternative, government, led, by, former, emperor, b, o, i, to, lead, an, autonomous, government, within, the, french, union, of, nations, this,

2, french, commanders, began, using, hedgehog, tactics, consisting, in, setting, up, well, defended, outposts, to, get, the, vi, t, minh, out, of, the, forests, and, force, them, to, fight, conventional, battles, instead, of, using, guerrilla, tactics, on, october, 17, 1952, gi, p, launched, attacks, against, the, french, garrisons, along, ngh, a, l, northwest, of, hanoi, and, overran,

to, and, cancelled, the, operation, on, november, 14, beginning, to, withdraw, back, to, the, de, lattre, line, the, only, major, fighting, during, the, operation, came, during, the, withdrawal, when, the, vi, t, minh, ambushed, the, french, column, at, chan, muong, on, november, 17, the, road, was, cleared, after, a, bayonet, charge, by, the, indochinese, march, battalion, and, the, withdrawal, could, continue, the, french, lost, around, 1, 200, men, during, the, whole, operation, most, of, them, during, the, chan, muong, ambush, the, operation, was, partially, successful, proving, that, the, french, could, strike, out, at, targets, outside, the, de, lattre, line, however, it, failed, to, divert, the, vi, t, minh, offensive, or, seriously, damage, its, logistical, network, on, april, 9, 1953, gi, p, after, having, failed, repeatedly, in, direct, attacks, on, french, positions, in, vietnam, changed, strategy, and, began, to, pressure, the, french, by, invading, laos, surrounding, and, defeating, several, french, outposts, such, as, muong, khoua, in, may, general, henri, navarre, replaced, salan, as, supreme, commander, of, french, forces, in, indochina, he, reported, to, the, french, government, that, there, was, no, possibility, of, winning, the, war, in, indo, china, saying, that, the, best, the, french, could, hope, for, was, a, stalemate, navarre, in, response, to, the, vi, t, minh, attacking, laos, concluded, that, hedgehog, centers, of, defense, were, the, best, plan, looking, at, a, map, of, the, area, navarre, chose, the, small, town, of, i, n, bi, n, ph, located, about, 10, miles, 16, km, north, of, the, lao, border, and, 175, miles, 282, km, west, of, hanoi, as, a, target, to, block, the, vi, t, minh, from, invading, laos, i, n, bi, n, ph, had, a, number, of, advantages, it, was, on, a, vi, t, minh, supply, route, into, laos, on, the, nam, yum, river, it, had, an, old, airstrip, for, supply, and, it, was, situated, in, the, tai, mountains, where, the, tai, troops, allied, with, the, french, operated, operation, castor, was, launched, on, november, 20, 1953, with, 1, 800, men, of, the, french, 1st, and, 2nd, airborne, battalions, dropping, into, the, valley, of, i, n, bi, n, ph, and, sweeping, aside, the, local, vi, t, minh, garrison, the, paratroopers, gained, control, of, a, heart, shaped, valley, 12, miles, 19, km, long, and, 8, miles, 13, km, wide, surrounded, by, heavily, wooded, mountains, encountering, little, opposition, the, french, and, tai, units, operating, from, lai, ch, u, to, the, north, patrolled, the, mountains, the, operation, was, a, tactical, success, for, the, french, however, gi, p, seeing, the, weakness, of, the, french, position, started, moving, most, of, his, forces, from, the, de, lattre, line, to, i, n, bi, n, ph, by, mid, december, most, of, the, french, and, tai, patrols, in, the, mountains, around, the, town, were, wiped, out, by, vi, t, minh, ambushes, the, fight, for, control, of, this, position, would, be, the, longest, and, hardest, battle, for, the, french, far, east, expeditionary, corps, and, would, be, remembered, by, the, veterans, as, 57, days, of, hell, by, 1954, despite, official, propaganda, presenting, the, war, as, a, crusade, against, communism, the, war, in, indochina, was, still, growing, unpopular, with, the, french, public, the, political, stagnation, in, the, fourth, republic, meant, that, france, was, unable, to, extract, itself, from, the, conflict, the, battle, of, dien, bien, phu, took, place, in, 1954, between, vi, t, minh, forces, under, v,

with, as, many, as, 10, 000, viet, minh, personnel, having, been, killed, in, the, battle, such, a, high, amount, of, losses, has, led, some, historians, to, classify, the, viet, minh, s, triumph, as, a, pyrrhic, victory, and, has, been, attributed, as, a, factor, motivating, the, viet, minh, s, leadership, to, enter, peace, negotiations, with, france, shortly, thereafter, the, prisoners, taken,

that, may, express, the, aspirations, of, our, country, since, already, several, years, a, compromise, peace, a, peace, negotiated, with, the, opponent, seemed, to, me, commanded, by, the, facts, while, it, commanded, in, return, to, put, back, in, order, our, finances, the, recovery, of, our, economy, and, its, expansion, because, this, war, placed, on, our, country, an, unbearable, burden, and, here, appears, today, a, new, and, formidable, threat, if, the, indochina, conflict, is, not, resolved, and, settled, very, fast, it, is, the, risk, of, war, of, international, war, and, maybe, atomic, that, we, must, foresee, it, is, because, i, wanted, a, better, peace, that, i, wanted, it, earlier, when, we, had, more, assets, but, even, now, there, is, some, renouncings, or, abandons, that, the, situation, does, not, comprise, france, does, not, have, to, accept, and, will, not, accept, settlement, which, would, be, incompatible, with, its, more, vital, interests, france, will, remain, present, in, far, orient, neither, our, allies, nor, our, opponents, must, conserve, the, least, doubt, on, the, signification, of, our, determination, a, negotiation, has, been, engaged, in, geneva, i, have, longly, studied, the, report, consulted, the, most, qualified, military, and, diplomatic, experts, my, conviction, that, a, pacific, settlement, of, the, conflict, is, possible, has, been, confirmed, a, cease, fire, must, henceforth, intervene, quickly, the, government, which, i, will, form, will, fix, itself, and, will, fix, to, its, opponents, a, delay, of, 4, weeks, to, reach,

by, pcf, agents, has, been, reported, such, as, grenades, exploding, in, the, hands, of, legionaries, these, actions, became, such, a, cause, for, concern, by, 1950, that, the, french, assembly, voted, a, law, against, sabotage, between, march, 2, 8, at, this, session, tension, was, so, high, between, politicians, that, fighting, ensued, in, the, assembly, following, communist, deputies,
