chivalry, or, the, chivalric, language, is, an, informal, and, varying, code, of, conduct, developed, in, europe, between, 1170, and, 1220, it, is, associated, with, the, medieval, christian, institution, of, knighthood, with, knights, being, members, of, various, chivalric, orders, and, with, knights, and, gentlemen, s, behaviours, which, were, governed, by, chivalrous, social, codes, the, ideals, of, chivalry, were, popularized, in, medieval, literature, particularly, the, literary, cycles, known, as, the, matter, of, france, relating, to, the, legendary, companions, of, charlemagne, and, his, men, at, arms, the, paladins, and, the, matter, of, britain, informed, by, geoffrey, of, monmouth, s, historia, regum, britanniae, written, in, the, 1130s, which, popularized, the, legend, of, king, arthur, and, his, knights, of, the, round, table, the, code, of, chivalry, that, developed, in, medieval, europe, had, its, roots, in, earlier, centuries, it, arose, in, the, carolingian, empire, from, the, idealisation, of, the, cavalryman, involving, military, bravery, individual, training, and, service, to, others, especially, in, francia, among, horse, soldiers, in, charlemagne, s, cavalry, 2, over, time, the, meaning, of, chivalry, in, europe, has, been, refined, to, emphasize, more, general, social, and, moral, virtues, the, code, of, chivalry, as, it, stood, by, the, late, middle, ages, was, a, moral, system, which, combined, a, warrior, ethos, knightly, piety, and, courtly, manners, all, combining, to, establish, a, notion, of, honour, and, nobility, the, term, chivalry, derives, from, the, old, french, term, chevalerie, which, can, be, translated, as, horse, soldiery, originally, the, term, referred, only, to, horse, mounted, men, from, the, french, word, for, horse, cheval, but, later, it, became, associated, with, knightly, ideals, the, french, word, chevalier, originally, meant, a, man, of, aristocratic, standing, and, probably, of, noble, ancestry, who, is, capable, if, called, upon, of, equipping, himself, with, a, war, horse, and, the, arms, of, heavy, cavalryman, and, who, has, been, through, certain, rituals, that, make, him, what, he, is, therefore, during, the, middle, ages, the, plural, chevalerie, transformed, in, english, into, the, word, chivalry, originally, denoted, the, body, of, heavy, cavalry, upon, formation, in, the, field, in, english, the, term, appears, from, 1292, note, that, cavalry, is, from, the, italian, form, of, the, same, word, the, meaning, of, the, term, evolved, over, time, into, a, broader, sense, because, in, the, middle, ages, the, meaning, of, chevalier, changed, from, the, original, concrete, military, meaning, status, or, fee, associated, with, a, military, follower, owning, a, war, horse, or, a, group, of, mounted, knights, to, the, ideal, of, the, christian, warrior, ethos, propagated, in, the, romance, genre, which, was, becoming, popular, during, the, 12th, century, and, the, ideal, of, courtly, love, propagated, in, the, contemporary, minnesang, and, related, genres, the, ideas, of, chivalry, are, summarized, in, three, medieval, works, the, anonymous, poem, ordene, de, chevalerie, which, tells, the, story, of, how, hugh, ii, of, tiberias, was, captured, and, released, upon, his, agreement, to, show, saladin, 1138, 1193, the, ritual, of, christian, knighthood, the, libre, del, ordre, de, cavayleria, written, by, ramon, llull, 1232, 1315, from, majorca, whose, subject, is, knighthood, and, the, livre, de, chevalerie, of, geoffroi, de, charny, 1300, 1356, which, examines, the, qualities, of, knighthood, emphasizing, prowess, none, of, the, authors, of, these, three, texts, knew, the, other, two, texts, and, the, three, combine, to, depict, a, general, concept, of, chivalry, which, is, not, precisely, in, harmony, with, any, of, them, to, different, degrees, and, with, different, details, they, speak, of, chivalry, as, a, way, of, life, in, which, the, military, the, nobility, and, religion, combine, the, code, of, chivalry, is, thus, a, product, of, the, late, middle, ages, evolving, after, the, end, of, the, crusades, partly, from, an, idealization, of, the, historical, knights, fighting, in, the, holy, land, and, from, ideals, of, courtly, love, pioneering, french, literary, historian, l, on, gautier, compiled, what, he, called, the, medieval, ten, commandments, of, chivalry, in, his, book, la, chevalerie, 1884, in, fact, there, is, no, such, medieval, list, gautier, s, effort, was, a, series, of, moral, bullet, points, he, abstracted, from, his, broad, reading, of, 12th, and, 13th, century, romances, supporters, of, chivalry, have, assumed, since, the, late, medieval, period, that, there, was, a, time, in, the, past, when, chivalry, was, a, living, institution, when, men, acted, chivalrously, the, imitation, of, which, period, would, much, improve, the, present, however, with, the, birth, of, modern, historical, and, literary, research, scholars, have, found, that, however, far, back, in, time, the, age, of, chivalry, is, searched, for, it, is, always, further, in, the, past, even, back, to, the, roman, empire, from, jean, charles, l, onard, de, sismondi, we, must, not, confound, chivalry, with, the, feudal, system, the, feudal, system, may, be, called, the, real, life, of, the, period, of, which, we, are, treating, possessing, its, advantages, and, inconveniences, its, virtues, and, its, vices, chivalry, on, the, contrary, is, the, ideal, world, such, as, it, existed, in, the, imaginations, of, the, romance, writers, its, essential, character, is, devotion, to, woman, and, to, honour, i, 76, 77, sismondi, alludes, to, the, fictitious, arthurian, romances, about, the, imaginary, court, of, king, arthur, when, taken, as, factual, presentations, of, a, historical, age, of, chivalry, he, continues, the, more, closely, we, look, into, history, the, more, clearly, shall, we, perceive, that, the, system, of, chivalry, is, an, invention, almost, entirely, poetical, it, is, impossible, to, distinguish, the, countries, in, which, it, is, said, to, have, prevailed, it, is, always, represented, as, distant, from, us, both, in, time, and, place, and, whilst, the, contemporary, historians, give, us, a, clear, detailed, and, complete, account, of, the, vices, of, the, court, and, the, great, of, the, ferocity, or, corruption, of, the, nobles, and, of, the, servility, of, the, people, we, are, astonished, to, find, the, poets, after, a, long, lapse, of, time, adorning, the, very, same, ages, with, the, most, splendid, fictions, of, grace, virtue, and, loyalty, the, romance, writers, of, the, twelfth, century, placed, the, age, of, chivalry, in, the, time, of, charlemagne, the, period, when, these, writers, existed, is, the, time, pointed, out, by, francis, i, at, the, present, day, we, imagine, we, can, still, see, chivalry, flourishing, in, the, persons, of, du, guesclin, and, bayard, under, charles, v, and, francis, i, but, when, we, come, to, examine, either, the, one, period, or, the, other, although, we, find, in, each, some, heroic, spirits, we, are, forced, to, confess, that, it, is, necessary, to, antedate, the, age, of, chivalry, at, least, three, or, four, centuries, before, any, period, of, authentic, history, i, 79, prior, to, codified, chivalry, there, was, the, uncodified, code, of, noble, conduct, that, focused, on, the, preudomme, which, can, be, translated, as, a, wise, honest, and, sensible, man, this, uncodified, code, referred, to, as, the, noble, habitus, is, a, term, for, the, environment, of, behavioural, and, material, expectations, generated, by, all, societies, and, classes, as, a, modern, idea, it, was, pioneered, by, the, french, philosopher, sociologists, pierre, bourdieu, and, maurice, merleau, ponty, even, though, a, precedent, exists, for, the, concept, as, far, back, as, the, works, of, aristotle, crouch, in, 2019, argued, that, the, habitus, on, which, the, superstructure, of, chivalry, was, built, and, the, preudomme, was, a, part, were, recognised, by, contemporaries, as, components, of, courtoisie, from, latin, curialitas, which, was, defined, as, superior, conduct, appropriate, to, the, aristocratic, hall, court, or, curia, he, saw, it, as, being, taught, within, the, confines, of, the, hall, by, its, senior, figures, to, youths, confided, to, the, lord, and, his, household, for, their, social, upbringing, crouch, suggested, courtliness, had, existed, long, before, 1100, and, preceded, the, codified, medieval, noble, conduct, we, call, chivalry, which, he, sees, as, beginning, between, 1170, and, 1220, the, pre, chivalric, noble, habitus, as, discovered, by, mills, and, gautier, and, elaborated, by, stephen, jaeger, and, david, crouch, are, as, follows, the, prince, accordingly, is, the, minister, of, the, common, interest, and, the, bond, servant, of, equity, and, he, bears, the, public, person, in, the, sense, that, he, punishes, the, wrongs, and, injuries, of, all, and, all, crimes, with, even, handed, equity, his, rod, and, staff, also, administered, with, wise, moderation, restore, irregularities, and, false, departures, to, the, straight, path, of, equity, so, that, deservedly, may, the, spirit, congratulate, the, power, of, the, prince, with, the, words, thy, rod, and, thy, staff, they, have, comforted, me, his, shield, too, is, strong, but, it, is, a, shield, for, the, protection, of, the, weak, and, one, which, wards, off, powerfully, the, darts, of, the, wicked, from, the, innocent, those, who, derive, the, greatest, advantage, from, his, performance, of, the, duties, of, his, office, are, those, who, can, do, least, for, themselves, and, his, power, is, chiefly, exercised, against, those, who, desire, to, do, harm, therefore, not, without, reason, he, bears, a, sword, wherewith, he, sheds, blood, blamelessly, without, becoming, thereby, a, man, of, blood, and, frequently, puts, men, to, death, without, incurring, the, name, or, guilt, of, homicide, from, the, 12th, century, onward, chivalry, came, to, be, understood, as, a, moral, religious, and, social, code, of, knightly, conduct, the, particulars, of, the, code, varied, but, codes, would, emphasise, the, virtues, of, courage, honour, and, service, chivalry, also, came, to, refer, to, an, idealisation, of, the, life, and, manners, of, the, knight, at, home, in, his, castle, and, with, his, court, the, code, of, chivalry, as, it, was, known, during, the, late, medieval, age, developed, between, 1170, and, 1220, courtliness, remained, a, recognised, form, of, superior, conduct, in, medieval, european, society, throughout, the, middle, ages, courtly, behaviour, was, expected, of, all, aristocrats, and, its, norms, were, integrated, into, chivalric, literature, but, as, crouch, demonstrated, courtliness, unlike, chivalry, was, not, confined, to, noble, society, there, are, examples, of, servants, merchants, clergy, and, free, peasants, being, commended, for, their, courtly, behaviour, in, medieval, literature, his, explanation, for, the, appearance, of, chivalry, as, a, recognisable, and, prescriptive, code, of, behaviour, is, tied, into, the, more, exclusive, definition, of, nobility, that, appears, in, the, late, 12th, century, this, had, a, particular, impact, on, the, professional, horse, warrior, the, knight, retained, knights, were, a, prominent, feature, of, the, households, of, barons, counts, and, princes, and, were, thought, to, be, proper, associates, of, their, lords, as, such, knights, adopted, the, fashions, and, behaviours, of, their, lords, in, many, cases, knights, were, often, drawn, from, the, younger, sons, of, noble, families, so, they, would, regard, themselves, as, being, noble, too, if, less, noble, than, their, lords, crouch, locates, the, tipping, point, of, the, nobilising, of, the, knight, as, in, the, households, of, the, sons, of, king, henry, ii, of, england, and, in, particular, his, eldest, son, the, henry, the, young, king, died, 1183, young, henry, lived, a, lavish, lifestyle, of, unprecedented, expense, focussed, on, the, great, northern, french, tourneying, society, of, the, 1170s, and, 1180s, since, young, henry, had, no, domains, to, rule, his, father, was, willing, to, fund, the, itinerant, playboy, lifestyle, of, his, son, to, distract, him, from, meddling, in, his, realms, and, also, to, stake, a, claim, to, the, cultural, high, ground, over, the, other, european, princes, of, the, day, young, henry, was, nonetheless, heavily, criticised, for, his, wasteful, and, hedonistic, life, and, crouch, finds, it, significant, that, the, first, known, work, which, used, the, knight, as, a, moral, exemplar, and, as, a, definitive, nobleman, the, de, re, militari, of, ralph, niger, c, 1187, was, written, by, the, young, man, s, former, chaplain, in, part, as, a, moral, defence, of, the, knightly, lifestyle, crouch, suggests, another, reason, why, chivalry, coalesced, as, a, noble, code, in, the, late, 12th, century, in, his, analysis, of, conduct, literature, he, suggests, that, the, courtly, habitus, underwent, a, crisis, as, its, moral, failure, became, obvious, to, writers, particularly, in, the, materialism, that, motivated, courtly, society, crouch, sees, the, roman, des, eles, of, the, poet, knight, raoul, de, houdenc, as, a, critique, of, courtliness, and, its, failures, raoul, s, solution, is, to, focus, moral, eminence, on, the, figure, of, the, knight, who, is, to, be, the, avatar, of, a, new, moral, nobility, set, above, all, other, males, a, knight, was, to, eschew, materialism, envie, and, to, embrace, noble, generosity, largesce, in, medieval, literature, chivalry, can, be, classified, into, three, overlapping, areas, different, weight, given, to, different, areas, produced, different, strands, of, chivalry, emerging, with, the, knight, s, character, and, the, chivalric, ethos, were, novel, elements, revised, social, status, innovative, military, tactics, and, fresh, literary, themes, chivalric, codes, encompassed, regulations, such, as, pledging, loyalty, to, the, overlord, and, upholding, warfare, rules, these, rules, dictated, refraining, from, attacking, a, defenseless, opponent, and, prioritizing, the, capture, of, fellow, nobles, for, later, ransom, instead, of, immediate, harm, akin, to, adhering, to, a, perceived, codified, law, the, chivalric, ideals, are, based, on, those, of, the, early, medieval, warrior, class, and, martial, exercise, and, military, virtue, remain, integral, parts, of, chivalry, until, the, end, of, the, medieval, period, as, the, reality, on, the, battlefield, changed, with, the, development, of, early, modern, warfare, and, increasingly, restricted, it, to, the, tournament, ground, and, duelling, culture, the, joust, remained, the, primary, example, of, knightly, display, of, martial, skill, throughout, the, renaissance, the, last, elizabethan, accession, day, tilt, was, held, in, 1602, the, martial, skills, of, the, knight, carried, over, to, the, practice, of, the, hunt, and, hunting, expertise, became, an, important, aspect, of, courtly, life, in, the, later, medieval, period, see, terms, of, venery, related, to, chivalry, was, the, practice, of, heraldry, and, its, elaborate, rules, of, displaying, coats, of, arms, as, it, emerged, in, the, high, middle, ages, christianity, had, a, modifying, influence, on, the, classical, concept, of, heroism, and, virtue, nowadays, identified, with, the, virtues, of, chivalry, the, peace, and, truce, of, god, in, the, 10th, century, was, one, such, example, which, placed, limits, on, knights, to, protect, and, honour, the, weaker, members, of, society, and, also, help, the, church, maintain, peace, at, the, same, time, the, church, became, more, tolerant, of, war, in, the, defence, of, faith, espousing, theories, of, the, just, war, and, liturgies, were, introduced, which, blessed, a, knight, s, sword, and, a, bath, of, chivalric, purification, in, the, grail, romances, and, chevalier, au, cygne, it, was, the, ethos, of, the, christian, knighthood, that, its, way, of, life, was, to, please, god, and, chivalry, was, an, order, of, god, chivalry, as, a, christian, vocation, combined, teutonic, heroic, values, with, the, militant, tradition, of, old, testament, the, first, noted, support, for, chivalric, vocation, or, the, establishment, of, a, knightly, class, to, ensure, the, sanctity, and, legitimacy, of, christianity, was, written, in, 930, by, odo, abbot, of, cluny, in, the, vita, of, st, gerald, of, aurillac, which, argued, that, the, sanctity, of, christ, and, christian, doctrine, can, be, demonstrated, through, the, legitimate, unsheathing, of, the, sword, against, the, enemy, in, the, 11th, century, the, concept, of, a, knight, of, christ, miles, christi, gained, currency, in, france, spain, and, italy, these, concepts, of, religious, chivalry, were, further, elaborated, in, the, era, of, the, crusades, with, the, crusades, themselves, often, seen, as, a, chivalrous, enterprise, the, military, orders, of, the, crusades, which, developed, in, this, period, came, to, be, seen, as, the, earliest, flowering, of, chivalry, and, some, of, their, opponents, like, saladin, were, likewise, depicted, as, chivalrous, adversaries, it, remains, unclear, to, what, extent, the, notable, military, figures, of, this, period, such, as, saladin, godfrey, of, bouillon, william, marshal, or, bertrand, du, guesclin, actually, did, set, new, standards, of, knightly, behaviour, or, to, what, extent, they, merely, behaved, according, to, existing, models, of, conduct, which, came, in, retrospect, to, be, interpreted, along, the, lines, of, the, chivalry, ideal, of, the, late, middle, ages, nevertheless, chivalry, and, crusades, were, not, the, same, thing, while, the, crusading, ideology, had, largely, influenced, the, ethic, of, chivalry, during, its, formative, times, chivalry, itself, was, related, to, a, whole, range, of, martial, activities, and, aristocratic, values, which, had, no, necessary, linkage, with, crusading, the, virgin, mary, was, venerated, by, multiple, chivalric, orders, including, the, teutonic, knights, who, honored, her, as, their, patroness, the, medieval, development, of, chivalry, with, the, concept, of, the, honour, of, a, lady, and, the, ensuing, knightly, devotion, to, it, not, only, derived, from, the, thinking, about, mary, but, also, contributed, to, it, although, women, were, at, times, viewed, as, the, source, of, evil, it, was, mary, who, as, mediator, to, god, was, a, source, of, refuge, for, man, the, development, of, medieval, mariology, and, the, changing, attitudes, towards, women, paralleled, each, other, the, works, of, roman, poets, like, ovid, and, cicero, bore, some, similarities, to, the, typical, depiction, of, romance, in, chivalric, literature, during, the, middle, ages, in, ovid, s, works, lovers, became, sleepless, grew, pale, and, lost, their, appetite, while, cicero, s, works, celebrated, the, ennobling, power, of, love, some, scholars, also, point, to, the, romantic, poetry, of, the, arabs, as, antecedents, to, the, depiction, of, courtly, love, in, medieval, european, literature, in, the, works, of, the, cordoban, author, ibn, hazm, for, example, lovers, develop, passions, for, slave, boys, as, well, as, girls, interchangeably, and, the, slave, is, recognized, as, now, the, master, of, his, beloved, ibn, hazm, s, the, ring, of, the, dove, is, a, noteworthy, depiction, of, a, lover, s, extreme, submissiveness, medieval, courtly, literature, glorifies, the, valour, tactics, and, ideals, of, both, moors, and, ancient, romans, for, example, the, ancient, handbook, of, warfare, written, by, vegetius, called, de, re, militari, was, translated, into, french, in, the, 13th, century, as, l, art, de, chevalerie, by, jean, de, meun, later, writers, also, drew, from, vegetius, such, as, honor, bonet, who, wrote, the, 14th, century, l, arbes, des, batailles, which, discussed, the, morals, and, laws, of, war, in, the, 15th, century, christine, de, pizan, combined, themes, from, vegetius, bonet, and, frontinus, in, livre, des, faits, d, armes, et, de, chevalerie, in, the, 14th, century, jean, froissart, wrote, his, chronicles, which, captured, much, of, the, hundred, years, war, including, the, battle, of, cr, cy, and, later, the, battle, of, poitiers, both, of, which, saw, the, defeat, of, the, french, nobility, by, armies, made, up, largely, of, common, men, using, longbows, the, chivalric, tactic, employed, by, the, french, armoured, nobility, namely, bravely, charging, the, opposition, in, the, face, of, a, hail, of, arrows, failed, repeatedly, froissart, noted, the, subsequent, attacks, by, common, english, and, welsh, archers, upon, the, fallen, french, knights, chronicles, also, captured, a, series, of, uprisings, by, common, people, against, the, nobility, such, as, the, jacquerie, and, the, peasant, s, revolt, and, the, rise, of, the, common, man, to, leadership, ranks, within, armies, many, of, these, men, were, promoted, during, the, hundred, years, war, but, were, later, left, in, france, when, the, english, nobles, returned, home, and, became, mercenaries, in, the, free, companies, for, example, john, hawkwood, the, mercenary, leader, of, the, white, company, the, rise, of, effective, paid, soldiery, replaced, noble, soldiery, during, this, period, leading, to, a, new, class, of, military, leader, without, any, adherence, to, the, chivalric, code, chivalry, underwent, a, revival, and, elaboration, of, chivalric, ceremonial, and, rules, of, etiquette, in, the, 14th, century, that, was, examined, by, johan, huizinga, in, the, waning, of, the, middle, ages, which, dedicates, a, chapter, to, the, idea, of, chivalry, in, contrasting, the, literary, standards, of, chivalry, with, the, actual, warfare, of, the, age, the, historian, finds, the, imitation, of, an, ideal, past, illusory, in, an, aristocratic, culture, such, as, burgundy, and, france, at, the, close, of, the, middle, ages, to, be, representative, of, true, culture, means, to, produce, by, conduct, by, customs, by, manners, by, costume, by, deportment, the, illusion, of, a, heroic, being, full, of, dignity, and, honour, of, wisdom, and, at, all, events, of, courtesy, the, dream, of, past, perfection, ennobles, life, and, its, forms, fills, them, with, beauty, and, fashions, them, anew, as, forms, of, art, in, the, later, middle, ages, wealthy, merchants, strove, to, adopt, chivalric, attitudes, the, sons, of, the, bourgeoisie, were, educated, at, aristocratic, courts, where, they, were, trained, in, the, manners, of, the, knightly, class, this, was, a, democratisation, of, chivalry, leading, to, a, new, genre, called, the, courtesy, book, which, were, guides, to, the, behaviour, of, gentlemen, thus, the, post, medieval, gentlemanly, code, of, the, value, of, a, man, s, honour, respect, for, women, and, a, concern, for, those, less, fortunate, is, directly, derived, from, earlier, ideals, of, chivalry, and, historical, forces, that, created, it, japan, was, the, only, country, that, banned, the, use, of, firearms, completely, to, maintain, ideals, of, chivalry, and, acceptable, form, of, combat, in, 1543, japan, established, a, government, monopoly, on, firearms, the, japanese, government, destroyed, firearms, and, enforced, a, preference, for, traditional, japanese, weapons, medieval, historian, richard, w, kaeuper, saw, chivalry, as, a, central, focus, in, the, study, of, the, european, middle, ages, that, was, too, often, presented, as, a, civilizing, and, stabilizing, influence, in, the, turbulent, middle, ages, on, the, contrary, kaueper, argues, that, in, the, problem, of, public, order, the, knights, themselves, played, an, ambivalent, problematic, role, and, that, the, guides, to, their, conduct, that, chivalry, provided, were, in, themselves, complex, and, problematic, 3, many, of, the, codes, and, ideals, of, chivalry, were, contradictory, when, knights, did, live, up, to, them, they, did, not, lead, to, a, more, ordered, and, peaceful, society, the, tripartite, conception, of, medieval, european, society, those, who, pray, those, who, fight, and, those, who, work, along, with, other, linked, subcategories, of, monarchy, and, aristocracy, worked, in, congruence, with, knighthood, to, reform, the, institution, in, an, effort, to, secure, public, order, in, a, society, just, coming, into, its, mature, formation, 4, kaeuper, says, that, knighthood, and, the, worldview, of, those, who, fight, was, pre, christian, in, many, ways, and, outside, the, purview, of, the, church, at, least, initially, the, church, saw, it, as, a, duty, to, reform, and, guide, knights, in, a, way, that, weathered, the, disorderly, martial, and, chauvinistic, elements, of, chivalry, 62, 83, royalty, also, clashed, with, knighthood, over, the, conduct, of, warfare, and, personal, disputes, between, knights, and, other, knights, and, even, between, knights, and, aristocracy, 93, 97, while, the, worldview, of, those, who, work, the, burgeoning, merchant, class, and, bourgeoisie, was, still, in, incubation, kaeuper, states, that, the, social, and, economic, class, that, would, end, up, defining, modernity, was, fundamentally,
