related, to, the, family, by, agnatic, kinship, both, through, the, bourbon, branch, of, the, dynasty, along, with, the, house, of, habsburg, arguably, its, greatest, historic, rival, it, was, one, of, the, two, oldest, european, royal, dynasties, it, was, also, one, of, the, most, powerful, royal, family, in, european, history, having, played, a, major, role, in, its, politics, for, much, of,

founder, hugh, who, was, known, as, hugh, capet, the, meaning, of, capet, a, nickname, rather, than, a, surname, of, the, modern, sort, is, unknown, while, folk, etymology, identifies, it, with, cape, other, suggestions, indicate, it, might, be, connected, to, the, latin, word, caput, head, and, explain, it, as, meaning, chief, or, head, historians, in, the, 19th, century, see, house, of, france, came, to, apply, the, name, capetian, to, both, the, ruling, house, of, france, and, to, the, wider, spread, male, line, descendants, of, hugh, capet, it, was, not, a, contemporary, practice, the, name, capet, has, also, been, used, as, a, surname, for, french, royalty, particularly, but, not, exclusively, those, of, the, house, of, capet, one, notable, use, was, during, the, french, revolution, when, the, dethroned, king, louis, xvi, a, member, of, the, house, of, bourbon, and, a, direct, male, line, descendant, of, hugh, capet, and, queen, marie, antoinette, a, member, of, the, house, of, habsburg, lorraine, were, referred, to, as, louis, and, antoinette, capet, the, queen, being, addressed, as, the, widow, capet, after, the, execution, of, her, husband, the, capetian, miracle, french, miracle, cap, tien, refers, to, the, dynasty, s, ability, to, attain, and, hold, onto, the, french, crown, in, 987, hugh, capet, was, elected, to, succeed, louis, v, of, the, carolingian, dynasty, that, had, ruled, france, for, over, three, centuries, by, a, process, of, associating, elder, sons, with, them, in, the, kingship, the, early, capetians, established, the, hereditary, succession, in, their, family, and, transformed, a, theoretically, electoral, kingship, into, a, sacral, one, by, the, time, of, philip, ii, augustus, who, became, king, in, 1180, the, capetian, hold, on, power, was, so, strong, that, the, practice, of, associate, kingship, was, dropped, while, the, capetian, monarchy, began, as, one, of, the, weakest, in, europe, drastically, eclipsed, by, the, new, anglo, norman, realm, in, england, who, as, dukes, of, normandy, were, technically, their, vassals, and, even, other, great, lords, of, france, the, political, value, of, orderly, succession, in, the, middle, ages, cannot, be, overstated, the, orderly, succession, of, power, from, father, to, son, over, such, a, long, period, of, time, meant, that, the, french, monarchs, who, originally, were, essentially, just, the, direct, rulers, of, the, le, de, france, were, able, to, preserve, and, extend, their, power, while, over, the, course, of, centuries, the, great, peers, of, the, realm, would, eventually, lose, their, power, in, one, succession, crisis, or, another, by, comparison, the, crusader, kingdom, of, jerusalem, was, constantly, beset, with, internal, succession, disputes, because, each, generation, only, produced, female, heirs, who, tended, to, die, young, even, the, english, monarchy, encountered, severe, succession, crises, such, as, the, anarchy, of, the, 1120s, between, stephen, and, matilda, and, the, murder, of, arthur, i, duke, of, brittany, the, primogeniture, heir, of, richard, i, of, england, the, latter, case, would, deal, a, severe, blow, to, the, prestige, of, king, john, leading, to, the, eventual, destruction, of, angevin, hegemony, in, france, in, contrast, the, french, kings, were, able, to, maintain, uncontested, father, to, son, succession, from, the, time, of, hugh, capet, until, the, succession, crisis, which, began, the, hundred, years, war, of, the, 14th, century, the, dynastic, surname, now, used, to, describe, hugh, capet, s, family, prior, to, his, election, as, king, of, france, is, robertians, or, robertines, the, name, is, derived, from, the, family, s, first, certain, ancestor, robert, the, strong, b, 820, the, count, of, paris, robert, was, probably, son, of, robert, iii, of, worms, b, 800, and, grandson, of, robert, of, hesbaye, b, 770, the, robertians, probably, originated, in, the, county, hesbaye, around, tongeren, in, modern, day, belgium, the, sons, of, robert, the, strong, were, odo, and, robert, who, both, ruled, as, king, of, western, francia, the, family, became, counts, of, paris, under, odo, and, dukes, of, the, franks, under, robert, possessing, large, parts, of, neustria, in, the, late, 9th, century, king, robert, i, grandfather, of, hugh, capet, married, beatrice, of, vermandois, a, direct, descendant, of, charlemagne, thus, making, the, capetian, dynasty, a, cadet, branch, of, the, carolingian, dynasty, the, carolingian, dynasty, ceased, to, rule, france, upon, the, death, of, louis, v, afterwards, the, son, of, hugh, the, great, hugh, capet, was, elected, by, the, nobility, as, king, of, france, hugh, was, crowned, at, noyon, on, 3, july, 987, with, the, full, support, from, holy, roman, emperor, otto, iii, hugh, s, coronation, ushered, in, a, new, era, for, france, and, his, descendants, came, to, be, called, the, capetians, with, the, capetian, dynasty, and, its, cadet, branches, such, as, the, house, of, valois, ruling, france, for, more, than, 800, years, 987, 1848, with, two, interruptions, during, the, french, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, wars, first, between, 1792, and, 1814, and, then, for, three, months, in, 1815, over, the, succeeding, centuries, capetians, spread, throughout, europe, ruling, every, form, of, provincial, unit, from, kingdoms, to, manors, salic, law, re, established, during, the, hundred, years, war, from, an, ancient, frankish, tradition, caused, the, french, monarchy, to, permit, only, male, agnatic, descendants, of, hugh, to, succeed, to, the, throne, of, france, without, salic, law, upon, the, death, of, john, i, the, crown, would, have, passed, to, his, half, sister, joan, later, joan, ii, of, navarre, however, joan, s, paternity, was, suspect, due, to, her, mother, s, adultery, in, the, tour, de, nesle, affair, the, french, magnates, adopted, salic, law, to, avoid, the, succession, of, a, possible, bastard, in, 1328, king, charles, iv, of, france, died, without, male, heirs, as, his, brothers, did, before, him, philip, of, valois, the, late, king, s, first, cousin, acted, as, regent, pending, the, birth, of, the, king, s, posthumous, child, which, proved, to, be, a, girl, isabella, of, france, sister, of, charles, iv, claimed, the, throne, for, her, son, edward, iii, of, england, the, english, king, did, not, find, support, among, the, french, lords, who, made, philip, of, valois, their, king, from, then, on, the, french, succession, not, only, excluded, females, but, also, rejected, claims, based, on, the, female, line, of, descent, thus, the, french, crown, passed, from, the, house, of, capet, after, the, death, of, charles, iv, to, philip, vi, of, france, of, the, house, of, valois, a, cadet, branch, of, the, capetian, dynasty, this, did, not, affect, monarchies, not, under, that, law, such, as, portugal, spain, navarre, and, various, smaller, duchies, and, counties, therefore, many, royal, families, appear, and, disappear, in, the, french, succession, or, become, cadet, branches, upon, marriage, a, complete, list, of, the, senior, most, line, of, capetians, is, available, below, the, capetian, dynasty, has, been, broken, many, times, into, sometimes, rival, cadet, branches, a, cadet, branch, is, a, line, of, descent, from, another, line, than, the, senior, most, this, list, of, cadet, branches, shows, most, of, the, capetian, cadet, lines, and, designating, their, royal, french, progenitor, although, some, sub, branches, are, not, shown, throughout, most, of, history, the, senior, capet, and, the, king, of, france, were, synonymous, terms, only, in, the, time, before, hugh, capet, took, the, crown, for, himself, and, after, the, reign, of, charles, x, is, there, a, distinction, such, that, the, senior, capet, must, be, identified, independently, from, succession, to, the, french, crown, however, since, primogeniture, and, the, salic, law, provided, for, the, succession, of, the, french, throne, for, most, of, french, history, here, is, a, list, of, all, the, french, kings, from,

capetian, monarchs, ruled, a, large, part, of, europe, however, they, still, remain, as, kings, as, well, as, other, titles, currently, two, capetian, monarchs, still, rule, in, spain, and, luxembourg, in, addition, seven, pretenders, represent, exiled, dynastic, monarchies, in, brazil, france, spain, portugal, parma, and, two, sicilies, the, current, legitimate, senior, family, member,
