srivijaya, indonesian, sriwijaya, 131, also, spelled, sri, vijaya, was, a, buddhist, thalassocratic, empire, based, on, the, island, of, sumatra, in, modern, day, indonesia, that, influenced, much, of, southeast, asia, srivijaya, was, an, important, centre, for, the, expansion, of, buddhism, from, the, 7th, to, 11th, century, ad, srivijaya, was, the, first, polity, to, dominate, much, of, western, maritime, southeast, asia, due, to, its, location, srivijaya, developed, complex, technology, utilizing, maritime, resources, in, addition, its, economy, became, progressively, reliant, on, the, booming, trade, in, the, region, thus, transforming, it, into, a, prestige, goods, based, economy, the, earliest, reference, to, it, dates, from, the, 7th, century, a, tang, dynasty, chinese, monk, yijing, wrote, that, he, visited, srivijaya, in, 671, for, six, months, the, earliest, known, inscription, in, which, the, name, srivijaya, appears, also, dates, from, the, 7th, century, in, the, kedukan, bukit, inscription, found, near, palembang, sumatra, dated, 16, june, 682, between, the, late, 7th, and, early, 11th, century, srivijaya, rose, to, become, a, hegemon, in, southeast, asia, it, was, involved, in, close, interactions, often, rivalries, with, the, neighbouring, mataram, khom, and, champa, srivijaya, s, main, foreign, interest, was, nurturing, lucrative, trade, agreements, with, china, which, lasted, from, the, tang, to, the, song, dynasty, srivijaya, had, religious, cultural, and, trade, links, with, the, buddhist, pala, of, bengal, as, well, as, with, the, islamic, caliphate, in, the, middle, east, although, it, was, once, thought, of, as, a, maritime, empire, new, research, on, available, records, suggests, that, srivijaya, was, primarily, a, land, based, polity, rather, than, a, maritime, power, fleets, were, available, but, acted, as, logistical, support, to, facilitate, the, projection, of, land, power, in, response, to, the, change, in, the, maritime, asian, economy, and, threatened, by, the, loss, of, its, dependencies, the, kingdoms, around, the, strait, of, malacca, developed, a, naval, strategy, to, delay, their, decline, the, naval, strategy, was, mainly, punitive, this, was, done, to, coerce, trading, ships, to, be, called, to, their, port, later, the, naval, strategy, degenerated, to, raiding, fleet, the, kingdom, may, have, disintegrated, after, 1025, ce, following, several, major, raids, launched, by, the, chola, empire, upon, their, ports, 110, after, srivijaya, fell, it, was, largely, forgotten, it, was, not, until, 1918, that, french, historian, george, c, d, s, of, the, french, school, of, the, far, east, formally, postulated, its, existence, srivijaya, is, a, sanskrit, derived, name, r, vijaya, r, means, fortunate, prosperous, or, happy, and, also, has, some, association, with, the, divine, at, least, in, hinduism, vijaya, means, victorious, or, excellence, thus, the, combined, word, srivijaya, means, shining, victory, splendid, triumph, prosperous, victor, radiance, of, excellence, or, simply, glorious, early, 20th, century, historians, who, studied, the, inscriptions, of, sumatra, and, the, neighboring, islands, thought, that, the, term, srivijaya, referred, to, a, king, s, name, in, 1913, h, kern, was, the, first, epigraphist, that, identified, the, name, srivijaya, written, in, a, 7th, century, kota, kapur, inscription, discovered, in, 1892, however, at, that, time, he, believed, that, it, referred, to, a, king, named, vijaya, with, sri, as, an, honorific, title, for, a, king, or, ruler, the, sundanese, manuscript, of, carita, parahyangan, composed, around, the, late, 16th, century, in, west, java, mentioned, the, name, sang, sri, wijaya, the, manuscript, describes, princely, hero, that, rose, to, be, a, king, named, sanjaya, that, after, he, secured, his, rule, in, java, was, involved, in, battle, with, the, malayu, and, keling, against, their, king, sang, sri, wijaya, subsequently, after, studying, local, stone, inscriptions, manuscripts, and, chinese, historical, accounts, historians, concluded, that, the, term, srivijaya, was, in, reference, to, a, polity, or, kingdom, the, main, concern, is, to, define, srivijaya, s, amorphous, statehood, as, a, thalassocracy, which, dominated, a, confederation, of, semi, autonomous, harbour, cities, in, maritime, southeast, asia, little, physical, evidence, of, srivijaya, remains, there, had, been, no, continuous, knowledge, of, the, history, of, srivijaya, even, in, indonesia, and, maritime, southeast, asia, its, forgotten, past, has, been, resurrected, by, foreign, scholars, contemporary, indonesians, even, those, from, the, area, of, palembang, around, where, the, kingdom, was, based, had, not, heard, of, srivijaya, until, the, 1920s, when, the, french, scholar, george, c, d, s, published, his, discoveries, and, interpretations, in, dutch, and, indonesian, language, newspapers, c, d, s, noted, that, the, chinese, references, to, sanfoqi, previously, read, as, sribhoja, or, sribogha, and, the, inscriptions, in, old, malay, refer, to, the, same, empire, the, srivijayan, historiography, is, based, on, two, main, sources, the, chinese, historical, accounts, and, the, southeast, asian, stone, inscriptions, that, have, been, discovered, and, deciphered, in, the, region, the, buddhist, monk, yijing, s, account, is, especially, important, in, describing, srivijaya, when, he, visited, the, kingdom, in, 671, for, six, months, the, 7th, century, siddhayatra, inscriptions, discovered, in, palembang, and, bangka, island, are, also, vital, primary, historical, sources, also, regional, accounts, that, some, might, be, preserved, and, retold, as, tales, and, legends, such, as, the, legend, of, the, maharaja, of, zabaj, and, the, khmer, king, also, provide, a, glimpse, of, the, kingdom, some, indian, and, arabic, accounts, also, vaguely, describe, the, riches, of, the, king, of, zabag, it, s, likely, that, the, zabag, khmer, story, was, based, on, javanese, overlordship, over, cambodia, 269, 302, the, historical, records, of, srivijaya, were, reconstructed, from, a, number, of, stone, inscriptions, most, of, them, written, in, old, malay, using, pallava, script, such, as, the, kedukan, bukit, talang, tuwo, telaga, batu, and, kota, kapur, inscriptions, 82, 83, srivijaya, became, a, symbol, of, early, sumatran, importance, as, a, great, empire, to, balance, java, s, majapahit, in, the, east, in, the, 20th, century, both, empires, were, referred, to, by, nationalistic, intellectuals, to, argue, for, an, indonesian, identity, within, a, united, indonesian, state, that, had, existed, prior, to, the, colonial, state, of, the, dutch, east, indies, srivijaya, and, by, extension, sumatra, had, been, known, by, different, names, to, different, peoples, the, chinese, called, it, sanfotsi, sanfoqi, or, che, li, fo, che, shilifoshi, and, there, was, an, even, older, kingdom, of, kantoli, which, could, be, considered, the, predecessor, of, srivijaya, the, arabs, called, it, zabag, or, sribuza, and, the, khmer, called, it, melayu, while, the, javanese, called, them, suvarnabhumi, suvarnadvipa, melayu, or, malayu, this, is, another, reason, why, the, discovery, of, srivijaya, was, so, difficult, while, some, of, these, names, are, strongly, reminiscent, of, the, name, of, java, there, is, a, distinct, possibility, that, they, may, have, been, referring, to, sumatra, instead, according, to, the, kedukan, bukit, inscription, dated, 605, saka, 683, srivijaya, was, first, established, in, the, vicinity, of, today, s, palembang, on, the, banks, of, the, musi, river, it, mentions, that, dapunta, hyang, sri, jayanasa, came, from, minanga, tamwan, the, exact, location, of, minanga, tamwan, is, still, a, subject, of, discussion, the, palembang, theory, as, the, place, where, srivijaya, was, first, established, was, presented, by, c, des, and, supported, by, pierre, yves, manguin, soekmono, on, the, other, hand, argues, that, palembang, was, not, the, capital, of, srivijaya, and, suggests, that, the, kampar, river, system, in, riau, where, the, muara, takus, temple, is, located, as, minanga, tamwan, however, a, recent, study, suggests, that, minanga, tamwan, is, located, by, the, upper, komering, river, in, modern, minanga, village, cempaka, district, east, ogan, komering, ulu, regency, south, sumatra, komering, river, is, a, tributary, of, the, musi, river, with, its, confluence, located, in, palembang, other, than, the, kedukan, bukit, inscription, and, other, srivijayan, inscriptions, immediately, to, the, west, of, modern, palembang, city, a, quantity, of, artefacts, have, been, revealed, through, archaeological, surveys, commenced, since, the, 20th, century, artefacts, unearthed, include, large, amounts, of, chinese, ceramics, and, indian, rouletted, ware, remains, also, the, ruins, of, stupa, at, the, foot, of, bukit, seguntang, furthermore, a, significant, number, of, hindu, buddhist, statuary, has, been, recovered, from, the, musi, river, basin, these, discoveries, reinforce, the, suggestion, that, palembang, was, the, centre, of, srivijaya, nevertheless, palembang, left, little, archaeological, traces, of, ancient, urban, settlement, this, is, probably, because, of, the, nature, of, palembang, s, environment, a, low, lying, plain, which, is, frequently, flooded, by, the, musi, river, experts, suggests, that, the, ancient, palembang, settlement, was, formed, as, a, collection, of, floating, houses, made, from, thatched, materials, such, as, wood, bamboo, and, straw, zhao, rukuo, s, 13th, century, chinese, account, zhu, fan, zhi, confirmed, this, the, residents, of, sanfo, tsi, srivijaya, live, scattered, outside, the, city, on, the, water, within, rafts, lined, with, reeds, it, was, probably, that, only, kedatuan, king, s, court, and, religious, structures, were, built, on, land, while, the, people, live, in, floating, houses, along, the, musi, river, palembang, and, its, relevance, to, the, early, malay, state, were, controversial, in, terms, of, its, evidence, build, up, through, the, archaeological, record, strong, historical, evidence, found, in, chinese, sources, speaking, of, city, like, settlements, as, early, as, 700, ad, and, later, arab, travelers, who, visited, the, region, during, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, held, written, proof, named, the, kingdom, of, srivijaya, as, far, as, early, state, like, polities, in, the, malay, archipelago, the, geographical, location, of, modern, palembang, was, a, possible, candidate, for, the, 1st, millennium, kingdom, settlement, like, srivijaya, as, it, is, the, best, described, and, most, secure, in, historical, context, its, prestige, was, apparent, in, wealth, and, urban, characteristics, and, the, most, unique, which, no, other, 1st, millennium, kingdom, held, was, its, location, in, junction, to, three, major, rivers, the, musi, river, the, komering, river, and, the, ogan, river, the, historical, evidence, was, contrasted, in, 1975, with, publications, by, bennet, bronson, and, jan, wisseman, findings, at, certain, major, excavation, sites, such, as, geding, suro, penyaringan, air, bersih, sarang, wati, and, bukit, seguntang, conducted, in, the, region, played, major, roles, in, the, negative, evidence, of, the, 1st, millennium, kingdom, in, the, same, region, it, was, noted, that, the, region, contained, no, locatable, settlements, earlier, than, the, middle, of, the, second, millennium, lack, of, evidence, of, southern, settlements, in, the, archaeological, record, comes, from, the, disinterest, in, the, archeologist, and, the, unclear, physical, visibility, of, the, settlements, themselves, archeology, of, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, focused, more, on, art, and, epigraphy, found, in, the, regions, some, northern, urban, settlements, were, sited, due, to, some, overlap, in, fitting, the, sinocentric, model, of, city, state, urban, centres, an, approach, to, differentiate, between, urban, settlements, in, the, southern, regions, from, the, northern, ones, of, southeast, asia, was, initiated, by, a, proposition, for, an, alternative, model, excavations, showed, failed, signs, of, a, complex, urban, centre, under, the, lens, of, a, sinocentric, model, leading, to, parameters, of, a, new, proposed, model, parameters, for, such, a, model, of, a, city, like, settlement, included, isolation, in, relevance, to, its, hinterland, no, hinterland, makes, low, archaeological, visibility, the, settlement, must, also, have, access, to, both, easy, transportation, and, major, interregional, trade, routes, crucial, in, a, region, with, few, resources, access, to, the, former, and, later, played, a, major, role, in, the, creation, of, an, extreme, economic, surplus, in, the, absence, of, an, exploited, hinterland, the, urban, centre, must, be, able, to, organize, politically, without, the, need, for, ceremonial, foci, such, as, temples, monuments, and, inscriptions, lastly, habitations, must, be, impermanent, being, highly, probable, in, the, region, palembang, and, of, southern, southeast, asia, such, a, model, was, proposed, to, challenge, city, concepts, of, ancient, urban, centres, in, southeast, asia, and, basic, postulates, themselves, such, as, regions, found, in, the, south, like, palembang, based, their, achievements, in, correlation, with, urbanization, due, to, the, contradicting, pattern, found, in, southern, regions, like, palembang, in, 1977, bennet, bronson, developed, a, speculative, model, for, a, better, understanding, of, coastal, oriented, states, in, insular, southeast, asia, such, as, insular, and, peninsular, malaysia, the, philippines, and, western, indonesia, its, main, focus, was, the, relationship, of, political, economic, and, geographical, systems, the, general, political, and, economic, pattern, of, the, region, seems, irrelevant, to, other, parts, of, the, world, of, their, time, but, in, correlation, with, their, maritime, trade, network, it, produced, high, levels, of, socio, economic, complexity, he, concluded, from, his, earlier, publications, in, 1974, that, state, development, in, this, region, developed, much, differently, than, the, rest, of, early, southeast, asia, bronson, s, model, was, based, on, the, dendritic, patterns, of, a, drainage, basin, where, its, opening, leads, out, to, sea, being, that, historical, evidence, places, the, capital, in, palembang, and, in, junction, of, three, rivers, the, musi, river, the, komering, river, and, the, ogan, river, such, model, can, be, applied, for, the, system, to, function, appropriately, several, constraints, are, required, the, inability, for, terrestrial, transportation, results, in, movements, of, all, goods, through, water, routes, lining, up, economical, patterns, with, the, dendritic, patterns, formed, by, the, streams, the, second, being, the, overseas, centre, is, economically, superior, to, the, ports, found, at, the, mouth, of, the, rivers, having, a, higher, population, and, a, more, productive, and, technologically, advanced, economy, lastly, constraints, on, the, land, work, against, and, do, not, develop, urban, settlements, an, aerial, photograph, taken, in, 1984, near, palembang, in, what, is, now, srivijaya, archaeological, park, revealed, the, remnants, of, ancient, man, made, canals, moats, ponds, and, artificial, islands, suggesting, the, location, of, srivijaya, s, urban, centre, several, artefacts, such, as, fragments, of, inscriptions, buddhist, statues, beads, pottery, and, chinese, ceramics, were, found, confirming, that, the, area, had, once, been, densely, populated, by, 1993, pierre, yves, manguin, had, shown, that, the, centre, of, srivijaya, was, along, the, musi, river, between, bukit, seguntang, and, sabokingking, situated, in, what, is, now, palembang, south, sumatra, indonesia, palembang, is, called, in, chinese, pinyin, j, g, ng, lit, giant, harbour, this, is, probably, a, testament, of, its, history, as, a, once, a, great, port, in, 2021, numbers, of, treasures, were, surfaced, from, shallows, and, riverbed, of, the, musi, river, by, local, fishermen, that, turns, to, be, treasure, divers, the, troves, includes, coins, of, certain, periods, gold, jewelries, buddhist, statues, gems, colourful, beads, and, chinese, ceramic, fragments, however, these, troves, were, immediately, lost, as, local, treasure, hunters, immediately, has, sold, them, to, international, antiquities, dealers, before, archaeologists, could, properly, study, them, these, discoveries, led, to, the, treasure, rush, in, musi, river, in, 2021, where, locals, formed, groups, of, treasure, divers, operating, in, some, parts, of, the, musi, river, in, and, around, palembang, these, troves, seem, to, confirm, that, palembang, was, indeed, the, commercial, centre, of, srivijaya, some, scholars, argue, that, the, centre, of, srivijaya, was, located, in, muaro, jambi, and, not, palembang, in, 2013, archaeological, research, led, by, the, university, of, indonesia, discovered, several, religious, and, habitation, sites, at, the, muaro, jambi, temple, compounds, suggesting, that, the, initial, centre, of, srivijaya, was, located, in, the, muaro, jambi, regency, jambi, on, the, batang, hari, river, rather, than, on, the, originally, proposed, musi, river, the, archaeological, site, includes, eight, excavated, temple, sanctuaries, and, covers, about, 12, square, kilometers, and, stretches, 7, 5, kilometers, along, the, batang, hari, river, while, 80, mounds, menapos, of, temple, ruins, are, not, yet, restored, the, muaro, jambi, archaeological, site, was, mahayana, vajrayana, buddhist, in, nature, which, suggests, that, the, site, served, as, a, buddhist, learning, centre, connected, to, the, 10th, century, buddhist, scholar, suvar, advipi, dharmak, rti, chinese, sources, also, mentioned, that, srivijaya, hosted, thousands, of, buddhist, monks, compared, to, palembang, muaro, jambi, has, richer, archaeological, sites, i, e, multiple, red, brick, temples, and, building, structures, along, the, batang, hari, river, whilst, pelembang, has, no, comparable, temples, or, building, structures, the, proponents, of, the, theory, that, muaro, jambi, was, srivijaya, s, capital, point, out, that, the, descriptions, written, by, yijing, and, zhao, rukuo, the, description, of, srivijaya, realms, by, the, cholas, and, archaeological, findings, suggest, that, srivijaya, s, capital, fits, muaro, jambi, s, environment, better, than, the, marshy, palembang, the, study, also, compares, the, environment, geographical, location, and, the, economic, wealth, of, both, cities, arguing, that, jambi, located, on, the, mouth, of, the, batang, hari, river, basin, with, its, connection, to, minangkabau, hinterland, was, the, centre, of, gold, trade, in, the, area, that, described, as, the, fabulous, wealth, of, srivijaya, in, the, second, half, of, the, eighth, century, the, srivijayan, mandala, seems, to, have, been, ruled, by, the, sailendra, dynasty, of, central, java, several, arabic, sources, mentioned, that, zabag, the, javanese, sailendra, dynasty, ruled, over, sribuza, srivijaya, kalah, a, place, in, the, malay, peninsula, probably, kedah, and, ramni, a, place, in, sumatra, probably, lambri, however, it, s, unknown, whether, srivijaya, s, capital, moved, to, java, or, srivijaya, simply, became, a, subordinate, of, java, 20, 23, 8, 10, 30, 31, another, theory, suggests, that, dapunta, hyang, came, from, the, east, coast, of, the, malay, peninsula, and, that, the, chaiya, district, in, surat, thani, province, thailand, was, the, centre, of, srivijaya, the, srivijayan, period, is, referred, to, as, the, time, when, srivijaya, ruled, over, present, day, southern, thailand, in, the, region, of, chaiya, there, is, clear, evidence, of, srivijayan, influence, seen, in, artwork, inspired, by, mahayana, buddhism, because, of, the, large, amount, of, remains, such, as, the, ligor, stele, found, in, this, region, some, scholars, have, attempted, to, prove, that, chaiya, was, the, capital, this, period, was, also, a, time, for, art, the, buddhist, art, of, the, srivijayan, kingdom, was, believed, to, have, borrowed, from, indian, styles, like, that, of, the, dvaravati, school, of, art, some, scholars, believe, that, chaiya, probably, comes, from, srivijaya, it, was, a, regional, capital, in, srivijaya, some, thai, historians, argue, it, was, the, capital, of, srivijaya, itself, but, this, is, generally, discounted, around, 500, ce, the, roots, of, the, srivijayan, empire, began, to, develop, around, present, day, palembang, sumatra, the, kedukan, bukit, inscription, 683, considered, to, be, the, oldest, inscription, related, to, srivijaya, discovered, on, the, banks, of, the, tatang, river, near, the, karanganyar, site, states, about, the, glorious, srivijaya, a, kadatuan, kingdom, or, polity, which, was, founded, by, dapunta, hyang, sri, jayanasa, and, his, retinue, he, had, embarked, on, a, sacred, siddhayatra, journey, and, led, 20, 000, troops, and, 312, people, in, boats, with, 1, 312, foot, soldiers, from, minanga, tamwan, to, jambi, and, palembang, many, of, these, armed, forces, gathered, under, srivijayan, rule, would, have, been, the, sea, people, referred, to, generally, as, the, orang, laut, in, establishing, its, power, srivijaya, had, first, to, consolidate, its, position, in, southeast, sumatra, which, at, that, time, consisted, of, multiple, quasi, independent, polities, ruled, by, local, datus, chieftain, 4, from, the, old, malay, inscriptions, it, is, known, that, dapunta, hyang, sri, jayanasa, launched, a, maritime, conquest, in, 684, with, 20, 000, men, in, the, siddhayatra, journey, to, acquire, wealth, power, and, magical, powers, under, the, leadership, of, dapunta, hyang, sri, jayanasa, the, melayu, kingdom, became, the, first, kingdom, to, be, integrated, into, srivijaya, this, possibly, occurred, in, the, 680s, melayu, also, known, as, jambi, was, rich, in, gold, and, was, held, in, high, esteem, at, the, time, srivijaya, recognised, that, the, submission, of, melayu, would, increase, its, own, prestige, the, empire, was, organised, in, three, main, zones, the, estuarine, capital, region, centred, on, palembang, the, musi, river, basin, which, served, as, a, hinterland, and, estuarine, areas, capable, of, forming, rival, power, centres, the, areas, upstream, of, the, musi, river, were, rich, in, various, commodities, valuable, to, chinese, traders, the, capital, was, administered, directly, by, the, ruler, while, the, hinterland, remained, under, local, datus, or, tribal, chiefs, who, were, organised, into, a, network, of, alliances, with, the, srivijaya, maharaja, or, king, force, was, the, dominant, element, in, the, empire, s, relations, with, rival, river, systems, such, as, the, batang, hari, river, centred, in, jambi, the, telaga, batu, inscription, discovered, in, sabokingking, eastern, palembang, is, also, a, siddhayatra, inscription, from, the, 7th, century, this, inscription, was, very, likely, used, in, a, ceremonial, sumpah, allegiance, ritual, the, top, of, the, stone, is, adorned, with, seven, n, ga, heads, and, on, the, lower, portion, there, is, a, water, spout, to, channel, liquid, that, was, likely, poured, over, the, stone, during, a, ritual, the, ritual, included, a, curse, upon, those, who, commit, treason, against, kadatuan, srivijaya, the, talang, tuwo, inscription, is, also, a, siddhayatra, inscription, discovered, in, seguntang, hill, western, palembang, this, inscription, describes, the, establishment, of, the, r, ksetra, garden, endowed, by, king, jayanasa, of, srivijaya, for, the, well, being, of, all, creatures, 82, 83, it, is, likely, that, the, seguntang, hill, site, was, the, location, of, the, r, ksetra, garden, according, to, the, kota, kapur, inscription, discovered, on, bangka, island, the, empire, conquered, most, of, southern, sumatra, and, the, neighbouring, island, of, bangka, as, far, as, palas, pasemah, in, lampung, also, according, to, the, inscriptions, dapunta, hyang, sri, jayanasa, launched, a, military, campaign, against, java, in, the, late, 7th, century, a, period, which, coincided, with, the, decline, of, tarumanagara, in, west, java, and, the, kalingga, in, central, java, the, empire, thus, grew, to, control, trade, on, the, strait, of, malacca, the, western, side, of, java, sea, and, possibly, the, gulf, of, thailand, chinese, records, dating, to, the, late, 7th, century, mention, two, sumatran, kingdoms, and, three, other, kingdoms, on, java, as, being, part, of, srivijaya, by, the, end, of, the, 8th, century, many, western, javanese, kingdoms, such, as, tarumanagara, and, kalingga, were, within, the, srivijayan, sphere, of, influence, the, 7th, century, sojomerto, inscription, mentions, that, an, old, malay, speaking, shivaist, family, led, by, dapunta, selendra, had, established, themselves, in, the, batang, area, of, the, northern, coast, of, central, java, he, was, possibly, the, progenitor, of, the, sailendra, family, by, the, early, 8th, century, an, influential, buddhist, family, related, to, srivijaya, the, sailendra, family, of, javanese, ancestry, dominated, central, java, during, the, 8th, century, langkasuka, on, the, malay, peninsula, became, part, of, srivijaya, soon, after, this, pan, pan, and, tambralinga, north, of, langkasuka, came, under, srivijayan, influence, these, kingdoms, on, the, peninsula, were, major, trading, nations, that, transported, goods, across, the, kra, isthmus, the, ligor, inscription, in, vat, sema, muang, says, that, maharaja, dharmasetu, of, srivijaya, ordered, the, construction, of, three, sanctuaries, dedicated, to, the, bodhisattvas, padmapani, vajrapani, and, buddha, in, the, northern, malay, peninsula, the, sailendras, of, java, established, a, relationship, with, the, sumatran, srivijayan, lineage, and, then, further, established, their, rule, and, authority, in, the, mataram, kingdom, of, central, java, it, is, unknown, what, the, exact, nature, of, their, relationship, was, with, arab, sources, mentioning, that, zabag, java, ruled, over, sribuza, srivijaya, kalah, a, place, in, the, malay, peninsula, probably, kedah, and, ramni, a, place, in, sumatra, probably, lambri, 20, 23, 8, 10, 30, 31, in, java, dharanindra, s, successor, was, samaragrawira, r, 800, 819, mentioned, in, the, nalanda, inscription, dated, 860, as, the, father, of, balaputradewa, and, the, son, of, ailendravamsatilaka, the, jewel, of, the, ailendra, family, with, the, stylised, name, r, viravairimathana, the, slayer, of, a, heroic, enemy, which, refers, to, dharanindra, 92, unlike, his, predecessor, the, expansive, and, warlike, dharanindra, samaragrawira, seems, to, have, been, a, pacifist, enjoying, the, peaceful, prosperity, of, interior, java, in, the, kedu, plain, and, being, more, interested, in, completing, the, borobudur, project, it, was, in, these, years, at, the, beginning, of, the, 9th, century, that, the, khmer, prince, jayavarman, ii, was, appointed, governor, of, indrapura, in, the, mekong, delta, under, sailendran, rule, this, decision, was, later, proven, to, be, a, mistake, as, jayavarman, ii, revolted, moved, his, capital, further, inland, north, from, tonle, sap, to, mahendraparvata, severing, the, link, to, srivijaya, and, proclaimed, khmer, independent, from, java, in, 802, samaragrawira, was, mentioned, as, the, king, of, java, that, married, t, r, daughter, of, dharmasetu, 108, he, was, mentioned, by, his, other, name, rakai, warak, in, the, mantyasih, inscription, earlier, historians, such, as, n, j, krom, and, c, des, tend, to, equate, samaragrawira, and, samaratungga, as, the, same, person, 92, however, later, historians, such, as, slamet, muljana, equate, samaratungga, with, rakai, garung, mentioned, in, the, mantyasih, inscription, as, the, 5th, monarch, of, the, mataram, kingdom, this, would, mean, that, samaratungga, was, the, successor, of, samaragrawira, dewi, tara, the, daughter, of, dharmasetu, married, samaratunga, a, member, of, the, sailendra, family, who, assumed, the, throne, of, srivijaya, around, 792, by, the, 8th, century, the, srivijayan, court, was, virtually, located, in, java, as, the, sailendras, monarch, rose, to, become, the, maharaja, of, srivijaya, after, dharmasetu, samaratungga, became, the, next, maharaja, of, srivijaya, he, reigned, from, 792, to, 835, unlike, the, expansionist, dharmasetu, samaratungga, did, not, indulge, in, military, expansion, but, preferred, to, strengthen, the, srivijayan, hold, on, java, he, personally, oversaw, the, construction, of, the, grand, monument, of, borobudur, a, massive, stone, mandala, which, was, completed, in, 825, during, his, reign, according, to, c, d, s, in, the, second, half, of, the, ninth, century, java, and, sumatra, were, united, under, the, rule, of, a, sailendra, reigning, in, java, its, center, at, palembang, 92, samaratungga, like, samaragrawira, seems, to, have, been, influenced, by, peaceful, mahayana, buddhist, beliefs, and, strove, to, become, a, peaceful, and, benevolent, ruler, his, successor, was, princess, pramodhawardhani, who, was, betrothed, to, shivaite, rakai, pikatan, son, of, the, influential, rakai, patapan, a, landlord, in, central, java, the, political, move, that, seemed, to, be, an, effort, to, secure, peace, and, sailendran, rule, on, java, by, reconciling, the, mahayana, buddhist, with, shivaist, hindus, prince, balaputra, however, opposed, the, rule, of, pikatan, and, pramodhawardhani, in, central, java, the, relations, between, balaputra, and, pramodhawardhani, are, interpreted, differently, by, some, historians, an, older, theory, according, to, bosch, and, de, casparis, holds, that, balaputra, was, the, son, of, samaratungga, which, means, he, was, the, younger, brother, of, pramodhawardhani, later, historians, such, as, muljana, argued, that, balaputra, was, the, son, of, samaragrawira, and, the, younger, brother, of, samaratungga, which, would, make, himthe, uncle, of, pramodhawardhani, it, is, not, known, whether, balaputra, was, expelled, from, central, java, because, of, a, succession, dispute, with, pikatan, or, already, ruled, in, sumatra, either, way, it, seems, that, balaputra, eventually, ruled, the, sumatran, branch, of, sailendra, dynasty, and, was, enthroned, in, the, srivijayan, capital, of, palembang, historians, have, argued, that, this, was, because, balaputra, s, mother, tara, the, queen, consort, of, king, samaragrawira, was, the, princess, of, srivijaya, making, balaputra, the, heir, of, the, srivijayan, throne, balaputra, the, maharaja, of, srivijaya, later, stated, his, claim, as, the, rightful, heir, of, the, sailendra, dynasty, from, java, as, proclaimed, in, the, nalanda, inscription, dated, 860, 108, after, a, trade, disruption, at, canton, between, 820, and, 850, the, ruler, of, jambi, melayu, kingdom, was, able, to, assert, enough, independence, to, send, missions, to, china, in, 853, and, 871, 95, the, melayu, kingdom, s, independence, coincided, with, the, troubled, times, when, the, sailendran, balaputradewa, was, expelled, from, java, and, later, seized, the, throne, of, srivijaya, the, new, maharaja, was, able, to, dispatch, a, tributary, mission, to, china, by, 902, two, years, after, that, the, weakening, tang, dynasty, conferred, a, title, on, a, srivijayan, envoy, in, the, first, half, of, the, 10th, century, between, the, fall, of, tang, dynasty, and, the, rise, of, song, there, was, brisk, trading, between, the, overseas, world, with, the, fujian, kingdom, of, min, and, the, rich, guangdong, kingdom, of, nan, han, srivijaya, undoubtedly, benefited, from, this, sometime, around, 903, the, muslim, writer, ibn, rustah, was, so, impressed, with, the, wealth, of, the, srivijayan, ruler, that, he, declared, that, one, would, not, hear, of, a, king, who, was, richer, stronger, or, had, more, revenue, the, main, urban, centres, of, srivijaya, were, then, at, palembang, especially, the, karanganyar, site, near, seguntang, hill, area, muara, jambi, and, kedah, in, the, 10th, century, the, rivalry, between, sumatran, srivijaya, and, the, javanese, mataram, kingdom, became, more, intense, and, hostile, the, animosity, was, probably, caused, by, srivijaya, s, effort, to, reclaim, the, sailendra, lands, in, java, or, by, mataram, s, aspiration, to, challenge, srivijaya, domination, in, the, region, in, east, java, the, anjukladang, inscription, dated, 937, mentions, an, infiltration, attack, from, malayu, which, refers, to, a, srivijayan, attack, upon, the, mataram, kingdom, of, east, java, the, villagers, of, anjuk, ladang, were, awarded, for, their, service, and, merit, in, assisting, the, king, s, army, under, the, leadership, of, mpu, sindok, in, repelling, invading, malayu, sumatra, forces, subsequently, a, jayastambha, victory, monument, was, erected, in, their, honor, in, 990, king, dharmawangsa, of, java, launched, a, naval, invasion, against, srivijaya, and, attempted, to, capture, the, capital, palembang, the, news, of, the, javanese, invasion, of, srivijaya, was, recorded, in, chinese, song, period, sources, in, 988, a, srivijayan, envoy, was, sent, to, the, chinese, court, in, guangzhou, after, sojourning, for, about, two, years, in, china, the, envoy, learned, that, his, country, had, been, attacked, by, java, which, made, him, unable, to, return, home, in, 992, an, envoy, from, java, arrived, in, the, chinese, court, and, explained, that, their, country, was, involved, in, continuous, war, with, srivijaya, in, 999, the, srivijayan, envoy, sailed, from, china, to, champa, in, an, attempt, to, return, home, however, he, received, no, news, about, the, condition, of, his, country, the, srivijayan, envoy, then, sailed, back, to, china, and, appealed, to, the, chinese, emperor, for, the, protection, of, srivijaya, against, javanese, invaders, 229, dharmawangsa, s, invasion, led, the, maharaja, of, srivijaya, sri, cudamani, warmadewa, to, seek, protection, from, china, warmadewa, was, known, as, an, able, and, astute, ruler, with, shrewd, diplomatic, skills, in, the, midst, of, the, crisis, brought, by, the, javanese, invasion, he, secured, chinese, political, support, by, appeasing, the, chinese, emperor, in, 1003, a, song, historical, record, reported, that, the, envoy, of, san, fo, qi, was, dispatched, by, the, king, shi, li, zhu, luo, wu, ni, fo, ma, tiao, hua, sri, cudamani, warmadewa, the, srivijayan, envoy, told, the, chinese, court, that, in, their, country, a, buddhist, temple, had, been, erected, to, pray, for, the, long, life, of, chinese, emperor, and, asked, the, emperor, to, give, the, name, and, the, bell, for, this, temple, which, was, built, in, his, honor, rejoiced, the, chinese, emperor, named, the, temple, ch, eng, t, en, wan, shou, ten, thousand, years, of, receiving, blessing, from, heaven, which, is, china, and, a, bell, was, immediately, cast, and, sent, to, srivijaya, to, be, installed, in, the, temple, 6, in, 1006, srivijaya, s, alliance, proved, its, resilience, by, successfully, repelling, the, javanese, invasion, this, attack, opened, the, eyes, of, srivijayan, maharaja, to, the, threat, of, the, javanese, mataram, kingdom, so, he, laid, a, plan, to, destroy, his, javanese, rival, srivijaya, assisted, haji, king, wurawari, of, lwaram, to, revolt, which, led, to, the, attack, and, destruction, of, the, mataram, palace, this, sudden, and, unexpected, attack, took, place, during, the, wedding, ceremony, of, dharmawangsa, s, daughter, which, left, the, court, unprepared, and, shocked, with, the, death, of, dharmawangsa, and, the, fall, of, the, mataram, capital, srivijaya, contributed, to, the, collapse, of, mataram, kingdom, leaving, eastern, java, in, further, unrest, violence, and, ultimately, desolation, for, several, years, to, come, 130, 132, 141, 144, the, factors, in, the, decline, of, srivijaya, were, foreign, piracy, and, raids, that, disrupted, trade, and, security, in, the, region, rajendra, chola, the, chola, king, from, tamil, nadu, in, south, india, launched, naval, raids, on, ports, of, srivijaya, in, 1025, 142, 143, his, navy, sailed, swiftly, to, sumatra, using, monsoon, winds, made, a, stealth, attack, and, raided, srivijaya, s, 14, ports, the, strike, took, srivijaya, by, surprise, and, unprepared, they, first, ransacked, the, capital, city, of, palembang, and, then, swiftly, moved, on, to, other, ports, including, kadaram, modern, kedah, the, cholas, are, known, to, have, benefitted, from, both, piracy, and, foreign, trade, at, times, the, chola, s, seafaring, led, to, outright, plunder, and, conquest, as, far, as, southeast, asia, an, inscription, of, king, rajendra, states, that, he, had, captured, the, king, of, kadaram, sangrama, vijayatunggavarman, son, of, mara, vijayatunggavarman, and, plundered, many, treasures, including, the, vidhyadara, torana, the, jewelled, war, gate, of, srivijaya, adorned, with, great, splendour, according, to, the, 15th, century, malay, annals, rajendra, chola, i, after, the, successful, naval, raid, in, 1025, married, onang, kiu, the, daughter, of, vijayottunggavarman, this, invasion, forced, srivijaya, to, make, peace, with, the, javanese, kingdom, of, kahuripan, the, peace, deal, was, brokered, by, the, exiled, daughter, of, vijayottunggavarman, who, managed, to, escape, the, destruction, of, palembang, and, came, to, the, court, of, king, airlangga, in, east, java, she, also, became, the, queen, consort, of, airlangga, named, dharmaprasadottungadevi, and, in, 1035, airlangga, constructed, a, buddhist, monastery, named, srivijayasrama, dedicated, to, his, queen, consort, 163, the, cholas, continued, a, series, of, raids, and, conquests, against, parts, of, sumatra, and, the, malay, peninsula, for, the, next, 20, years, the, expedition, of, rajendra, chola, i, had, such, a, lasting, impression, on, the, malay, people, of, the, period, that, his, name, is, even, mentioned, as, raja, chulan, in, the, malay, annals, even, today, the, chola, rule, is, remembered, in, malaysia, as, many, malaysian, princes, have, names, ending, with, cholan, or, chulan, such, as, the, raja, of, perak, raja, chulan, rajendra, chola, s, overseas, expeditions, against, srivijaya, were, unique, in, india, s, history, and, its, otherwise, peaceful, relations, with, the, states, of, southeast, asia, the, reasons, for, the, naval, expeditions, are, uncertain, as, the, sources, do, not, state, its, exact, causes, nilakanta, sastri, suggests, that, the, attacks, were, probably, caused, by, srivijaya, s, attempts, to, throw, obstacles, in, the, way, of, chola, s, trade, with, the, east, or, more, probably, a, simple, desire, on, the, part, of, rajendra, chola, to, extend, his, military, victories, to, well, known, countries, to, gain, prestige, the, new, research, however, suggests, that, the, attack, was, a, pre, emptive, strike, with, a, commercial, motive, rajendra, chola, s, naval, strike, was, a, geostrategic, manoeuvre, the, raids, gravely, weakened, the, srivijayan, hegemony, and, enabled, the, formation, of, regional, kingdoms, like, kediri, which, were, based, on, intensive, agriculture, rather, than, coastal, and, long, distance, trade, with, the, passing, of, time, the, regional, trading, centre, shifted, from, the, old, srivijayan, capital, of, palembang, to, another, trade, centre, on, the, island, of, sumatra, jambi, which, was, the, centre, of, malayu, sanfoqi, sent, a, mission, to, china, in, 1028, but, this, would, refer, to, malayu, jambi, not, srivijaya, palembang, 398, 405, no, srivijayan, envoys, arrived, in, china, between, 1028, and, 1077, this, indicates, that, the, mandala, of, srivijaya, has, faded, it, is, very, possible, that, srivijaya, collapsed, in, 1025, 110, in, the, following, centuries, chinese, chronicles, still, mentioned, sanfoqi, but, this, term, probably, refers, to, the, malayu, jambi, kingdom, evidenced, by, the, chinese, record, of, sanfoqi, zhanbei, guo, jambi, country, of, sanfoqi, the, last, epigraphic, evidence, that, mentions, the, word, sriwijaya, or, srivijaya, comes, from, the, tanjore, inscription, of, the, chola, kingdom, in, 1030, or, 1031, 397, 398, 405, chola, control, over, srivijaya, lasted, for, several, decades, chinese, chronicles, mentioned, sanfoqi, zhu, nian, guo, which, means, chola, country, of, sanfoqi, likely, refer, to, kedah, sanfoqi, zhu, nian, guo, sent, missions, to, china, in, 1077, 1079, 1082, 1088, and, 1090, it, is, possible, that, the, cholas, installed, a, crown, prince, in, the, tamil, dominated, area, of, the, malacca, strait, 398, 399, 405, there, is, also, evidence, to, suggest, that, kulottunga, chola, the, maternal, grandson, of, emperor, rajendra, chola, i, in, his, youth, 1063, was, in, srivijaya, 148, restoring, order, and, maintaining, chola, influence, in, that, area, virarajendra, chola, states, in, his, inscription, dated, in, the, 7th, year, of, his, reign, that, he, conquered, kadaram, kedah, and, gave, it, back, to, its, king, who, came, and, worshiped, his, feet, these, expeditions, were, led, by, kulottunga, to, help, the, sailendra, king, who, had, sought, the, help, of, virarajendra, chola, an, inscription, of, canton, mentions, ti, hua, kialo, as, the, ruler, of, srivijaya, according, to, historians, this, ruler, is, the, same, as, the, chola, ruler, ti, hua, kialo, identified, with, kulottunga, mentioned, in, the, song, annals, and, who, sent, an, embassy, to, china, according, to, tan, yeok, song, the, editor, of, the, srivijayan, inscription, of, canton, kulottunga, stayed, in, kadaram, kedah, after, the, naval, expedition, of, 1067, ad, and, reinstalled, its, king, before, returning, to, south, india, and, ascending, the, throne, tamil,

from, sumatra, and, the, malay, peninsula, rattan, rare, timber, camphor, gems, and, precious, stones, from, borneo, exotic, birds, and, rare, animals, iron, sappan, sandalwood, and, rare, spices, including, clove, and, nutmeg, from, the, eastern, indonesian, archipelago, various, spices, of, southeast, asia, and, india, including, pepper, cubeb, and, cinnamon, also, chinese, ceramics, lacquerware, brocade, fabrics, silks, and, chinese, artwork, were, among, valuable, commodities, being, traded, in, srivijayan, ports, what, goods, were, actually, native, to, srivijaya, is, currently, disputed, due, to, the, volume, of, cargo, that, regularly, passed, through, the, region, from, india, china, and, arabia, foreign, traders, stopped, to, trade, their, cargo, in, srivijaya, with, other, merchants, from, southeast, asia, and, beyond, it, was, an, easy, location, for, traders, from, different, regions, to, meet, as, opposed, to, visiting, each, other, directly, this, system, of, trade, has, led, researchers, to, conjecture, that, the, actual, native, products, of, srivijaya, were, far, less, than, what, was, originally, recorded, by, chinese, and, arabic, traders, of, the, time, it, may, be, that, cargo, sourced, from, foreign, regions, accumulated, in, srivijaya, the, accumulation, of, particular, foreign, goods, that, were, easily, accessible, and, in, large, supply, might, have, given, the, impression, they, were, products, of, srivijaya, this, could, also, work, in, the, opposite, direction, with, some, native, srivijayan, goods, being, mistaken, as, foreign, commodities, ceramics, were, a, major, trade, commodity, between, srivijaya, and, china, with, shard, artefacts, found, along, the, coast, of, sumatra, and, java, it, is, assumed, that, china, and, srivijaya, may, have, had, an, exclusive, ceramics, trade, relationship, because, particular, ceramic, shards, can, only, be, found, at, their, point, of, origin, in, guangzhou, or, in, indonesia, but, nowhere, else, along, the, trade, route, there, have, been, some, discrepancies, with, the, dating, of, said, artifacts, ceramic, sherds, found, around, the, geding, suro, temple, complex, have, been, revealed, to, be, much, more, recent, than, previously, assumed, a, statuette, found, in, the, same, area, did, align, with, srivijayan, chronology, but, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, is, merely, a, coincidence, and, the, product, was, actually, brought, to, the, region, recently, the, currency, of, the, empire, was, gold, and, silver, coins, embossed, with, the, image, of, the, sandalwood, flower, of, which, srivijaya, had, a, trade, monopoly, on, and, the, word, vara, or, glory, in, sanskrit, other, items, could, be, used, to, barter, with, such, as, porcelain, silk, sugar, iron, rice, dried, galangal, rhubarb, and, camphor, some, arabic, sources, record, that, the, profits, acquired, from, trade, ports, and, levies, were, converted, into, gold, and, hidden, by, the, king, in, the, royal, pond, other, than, fostering, lucrative, trade, relations, with, india, and, china, srivijaya, also, established, commerce, links, with, arabia, in, a, highly, plausible, account, a, messenger, was, sent, by, maharaja, sri, indravarman, to, deliver, a, letter, to, caliph, umar, ibn, abd, al, aziz, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, in, 718, the, messenger, later, returned, to, srivijaya, with, a, zanji, a, black, female, slave, from, zanj, a, gift, from, the, caliph, to, the, maharaja, later, a, chinese, chronicle, made, mention, of, sri, indravarman, and, how, the, maharaja, of, srivijaya, had, sent, the, chinese, emperor, a, ts, engchi, chinese, spelling, of, the, arabic, zanji, as, a, gift, in, 724, arab, writers, of, the, 9th, and, 10th, century, in, their, writings, considered, the, king, of, al, hind, india, and, to, some, extent, might, include, southeast, asia, as, one, of, the, four, great, kings, in, the, world, the, reference, to, the, kings, of, al, hind, might, have, also, included, the, kings, of, southeast, asia, sumatra, java, burma, and, cambodia, they, are, invariably, depicted, by, the, arab, writers, as, extremely, powerful, and, being, equipped, with, vast, armies, of, men, horses, and, having, tens, of, thousands, of, elephants, they, were, also, said, to, be, in, possession, of, vast, treasures, of, gold, and, silver, trading, records, from, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, mention, srivijaya, but, do, not, expand, upon, regions, further, east, indicating, that, arabic, traders, were, not, engaging, with, other, regions, in, southeast, asia, serving, as, further, evidence, of, srivijaya, s, important, role, as, a, link, between, the, two, regions, for, some, periods, srivijaya, controlled, the, transoceanic, trade, in, its, central, passage, in, the, strait, of, malacca, as, part, of, the, maritime, silk, road, this, has, led, some, historian, to, argue, that, the, amorphous, statehood, of, srivijaya, which, dominated, a, confederation, of, semi, autonomous, port, cities, in, the, maritime, southeast, asia, was, actually, a, thalassocracy, however, the, true, nature, of, srivijaya, naval, development, and, maritime, hegemony, is, still, a, subject, of, studies, and, disagreements, among, historians, srivijaya, benefited, from, the, lucrative, maritime, trade, between, china, and, india, as, well, as, trading, in, products, such, as, maluku, spices, within, the, malay, archipelago, serving, as, southeast, asia, s, main, entrep, t, and, gaining, trade, patronage, by, the, chinese, court, srivijaya, was, constantly, managing, its, trade, networks, and, was, always, wary, of, potential, rival, ports, of, its, neighbouring, kingdoms, a, majority, of, the, revenue, from, international, trade, was, used, to, finance, the, military, which, was, charged, with, the, responsibility, of, protecting, the, ports, some, records, even, describe, the, use, of, iron, chains, to, prevent, pirate, attacks, srivijayan, settlers, may, have, colonized, some, parts, of, madagascar, the, migration, to, madagascar, was, estimated, to, have, taken, place, around, 830, previously, it, was, assumed, that, srivijaya, was, a, maritime, power, that, could, not, be, separated, from, ethnicity, and, society, in, the, malacca, strait, the, assumption, that, occurs, is, that, the, formation, of, a, successful, state, and, hegemony, in, the, strait, is, directly, related, to, the, ability, to, participate, in, international, maritime, activities, which, means, that, a, shore, based, state, like, this, develops, and, maintains, its, power, with, its, navy, however, a, survey, of, the, available, information, shows, that, such, an, assumption, is, incorrect, data, on, maritime, activity, are, scanty, and, mentions, of, their, navy, occurs, only, in, incomplete, sources, even, the, material, aspects, of, southeast, asian, navies, were, not, known, until, the, 15th, century, scientific, attention, generally, focused, on, shipbuilding, techniques, in, the, kedukan, bukit, inscription, 683, ad, it, is, recorded, that, only, 312, people, used, boats, out, of, a, total, force, of, 20, 000, people, which, also, included, 1312, land, soldiers, the, large, number, of, ground, troops, shows, that, srivijaya, s, navy, only, acted, as, a, minor, provider, of, logistical, support, in, the, 8th, century, srivijaya, s, naval, capabilities, grew, to, match, the, proportion, of, its, army, strength, although, it, only, played, a, role, as, logistical, support, the, absence, of, any, terms, denoting, maritime, vessel, for, general, use, and, military, showed, that, the, navy, was, not, a, permanent, aspect, of, srivijaya, even, when, neighboring, powers, in, maritime, asia, especially, java, during, the, 10th, to, 14th, centuries, and, the, chola, empire, in, the, 11th, century, began, to, develop, their, navies, srivijaya, s, naval, power, was, relatively, weak, for, example, songshi, and, wenxian, tongkao, note, that, between, 990, and, 991, a, srivijayan, envoy, was, unable, to, return, from, south, china, to, palembang, because, of, the, ongoing, military, conflict, between, java, and, srivijaya, however, the, javanese, arabs, from, the, middle, east, and, south, asia, were, able, to, maintain, diplomatic, and, economic, exchanges, with, china, during, this, time, the, javanese, navy, was, strong, enough, to, seriously, disrupt, srivijaya, s, communications, with, china, despite, the, naval, confrontation, between, java, and, srivijaya, communication, between, the, coastal, governments, of, the, indian, ocean, and, china, continued, during, this, time, suggesting, that, the, conflict, did, not, always, occur, on, the, high, seas, but, was, more, likely, to, be, confined, to, the, estuaries, and, rivers, around, the, srivijayan, capital, of, palembang, the, mouth, of, the, musi, river, and, the, bangka, straits, srivijaya, s, response, to, javanese, aggression, appeared, to, be, defensive, in, his, account, of, sanfoqi, zhao, rugua, records, in, zhufanzhi, ca, 1225, in, the, past, used, an, iron, chain, as, a, barrier, to, prepare, against, other, robbing, parties, arriving, on, vessels, there, were, opportunities, to, release, i, e, draw, it, by, hand, if, merchant, ships, arrive, it, has, to, be, released, the, inability, of, the, malacca, strait, states, to, respond, to, maritime, threats, became, very, clear, in, the, early, 11th, century, between, 1017, and, 1025, the, chola, empire, raided, the, main, malay, ports, in, the, strait, and, the, gulf, of, siam, including, kedah, malay, jambi, lambri, srivijaya, and, langkasuka, looted, the, kedah, treasury, and, captured, srivijayan, rulers, a, further, indication, of, the, incompetence, of, the, malacca, strait, states, to, defend, themselves, from, naval, attacks, until, the, 11th, century, at, least, in, terms, of, their, military, outlook, the, kingdom, was, arguably, land, based, only, with, the, changing, international, context, from, the, 11th, century, onwards, marked, initially, by, the, chola, attacks, and, then, with, the, increasing, presence, of, chinese, merchants, directly, operating, in, southeast, asian, waters, coupled, with, the, emergence, of, new, powers, on, the, seafront, did, the, role, and, nature, of, these, navies, begin, to, change, after, the, chola, attack, historians, believe, that, srivijaya, may, be, no, longer, the, appropriate, name, for, the, overlord, s, centre, and, epigraphic, references, to, sriwijaya, also, ceased, after, the, attack, however, the, chinese, term, for, srivijaya, namely, sanfoqi, was, still, used, centuries, later, but, after, 1025, the, term, sanfoqi, referred, to, the, malayu, dharmasraya, kingdom, where, the, mandala, was, re, centred, 398, 405, the, new, records, appeared, in, the, lingwai, daida, 1178, ce, written, by, zhou, qufei, this, country, sanfoqi, has, no, products, but, its, people, are, well, trained, in, warfare, when, they, put, medicine, on, their, body, they, can, t, be, hurt, in, offensive, naval, warfare, their, attacks, are, unmatched, therefore, neighboring, countries, are, aligned, with, it, if, foreign, ships, passing, through, the, vicinity, do, not, call, in, this, state, are, sent, to, teach, them, a, lesson, and, to, kill, therefore, the, state, is, rich, with, rhino, horn, elephant, ivory, pearls, aromatics, and, medicines, similar, information, about, sanfoqi, is, also, recorded, in, zhufanzhi, c, 1225, which, records, all, are, excellent, in, maritime, and, land, warfare, at, any, time, that, a, mobilisation, order, is, established, chieftains, command, all, of, them, prepare, and, equip, with, soldiers, equipment, and, food, arriving, at, the, enemy, they, dare, to, die, i, e, are, not, afraid, of, dying, the, elder, of, the, various, states, i, e, first, amongst, equals, this, state, is, at, the, middle, of, the, sea, controlling, the, choke, point, through, which, the, various, foreign, vessels, come, and, go, in, the, past, used, an, iron, chain, as, a, barrier, this, year, i, e, presently, it, is, not, taut, i, e, not, extended, and, not, used, pile, in, the, water, if, merchant, ships, cross, and, do, not, enter, then, ships, are, dispatched, to, do, battle, they, have, to, die, i, e, the, persons, onboard, the, merchant, ships, have, to, be, killed, hence, this, state, sanfoqi, is, a, great, shipping, centre, this, information, may, refer, to, sea, and, river, warfare, in, particular, given, the, extensive, navigation, capabilities, of, the, musi, and, batang, hari, rivers, where, the, main, centres, of, the, kingdoms, around, the, malacca, strait, palembang, and, jambi, were, located, these, records, show, that, both, the, nature, of, the, navy, and, the, role, it, played, in, the, survival, of, the, government, itself, in, the, late, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, became, very, different, at, the, same, time, the, 12th, century, saw, the, beginning, of, the, decline, of, the, empires, around, the, malacca, strait, and, in, the, eyes, of, its, foreign, partners, kedah, fell, outside, the, influence, of, sanfoqi, during, the, 11th, century, by, the, early, 13th, century, pahang, kuala, beranang, and, kompei, had, established, direct, economic, links, with, the, chinese, port, of, quanzhou, jambi, became, independent, from, sanfoqi, s, influence, in, the, early, 13th, century, while, ligor, fell, under, the, influence, of, tambralingga, in, the, 1230s, after, singhasari, s, attack, on, malayu, in, 1275, a, large, number, of, malay, port, states, emerged, in, the, strait, each, seeking, to, engage, directly, with, foreign, traders, with, varying, degrees, of, success, therefore, the, development, of, an, increasingly, proactive, naval, strategy, was, not, only, a, reaction, to, the, changing, nature, of, interactions, with, major, trading, partners, such, as, china, and, india, but, also, as, a, result, of, the, polities, declining, power, textual, record, of, srivijayan, vessels, are, very, lacking, as, old, malay, epigraphical, records, rarely, mentioned, watercraft, the, kedukan, bukit, inscription, 683, ad, mentioned, samvau, modern, malay, sampan, a, ship, type, called, lancang, is, identified, as, a, malay, type, of, ship, in, later, records, but, during, the, srivijaya, era, the, ship, was, mentioned, in, 2, inscriptions, on, the, northern, coast, of, bali, dated, 896, and, 923, ad, these, inscriptions, are, written, in, the, old, balinese, language, and, not, in, old, malay, 149, 150, the, core, of, the, srivijayan, realm, was, concentrated, in, and, around, the, malacca, and, sunda, straits, and, in, sumatra, the, malay, peninsula, and, western, java, however, between, the, 9th, and, the, 12th, centuries, the, influence, of, srivijaya, seems, to, have, extended, far, beyond, this, core, srivijayan, navigators, may, have, reached, as, far, as, madagascar, the, migration, to, madagascar, was, estimated, to, have, taken, place, around, 830, ce,

served, as, sangha, community, the, monastic, buddhist, learning, centres, of, the, region, in, the, 5th, century, ad, the, chinese, monk, faxian, visited, the, region, 250, years, later, the, monk, yijing, stayed, in, srivijaya, for, six, months, and, studied, sanskrit, according, to, yijing, within, palembang, there, were, more, than, 1, 000, monks, studying, for, themselves, and, training, traveling, scholars, who, were, going, from, india, to, china, and, vice, versa, most, of, these, travelers, stayed, in, palembang, for, long, periods, of, time, to, wait, for, monsoon, winds, to, help, further, their, journey, a, stronghold, of, vajrayana, buddhism, srivijaya, attracted, pilgrims, and, scholars, from, other, parts, of, asia, these, included, the, chinese, monk, yijing, who, made, several, lengthy, visits, to, sumatra, on, his, way, to, study, at, nalanda, university, in, india, in, 671, and, 695, and, the, 11th, century, bengali, buddhist, scholar, atisha, who, played, a, major, role, in, the, development, of, vajrayana, buddhism, in, tibet, yijing, and, other, monks, of, his, time, practiced, a, pure, version, of, buddhism, although, the, religion, allowed, for, cultural, changes, to, be, made, he, is, also, given, credit, for, translating, buddhist, text, which, has, the, most, instructions, on, the, discipline, of, the, religion, yijing, wrote, his, memoir, of, buddhism, whilst, in, srivijaya, travellers, to, these, islands, mentioned, that, gold, coins, were, in, use, in, the, coastal, areas, but, not, inland, srivijaya, drew, in, priests, from, as, far, away, as, korea, a, notable, srivijayan, and, revered, buddhist, scholar, was, dharmakirti, who, taught, buddhist, philosophy, in, srivijaya, and, nalanda, the, language, diction, of, many, inscriptions, found, near, where, srivijaya, once, reigned, incorporated, indian, tantric, conceptions, this, evidence, makes, it, clear, the, relationship, of, the, ruler, and, the, concept, of, bodhisattva, one, who, was, to, become, a, buddha, this, is, the, first, evidence, seen, in, the, archaeological, record, of, a, southeast, asian, ruler, regarded, as, a, religious, leader, figure, one, thing, researchers, have, found, srivijaya, to, be, lacking, is, an, emphasis, in, art, and, architecture, while, neighboring, regions, have, evidence, of, intricate, architecture, palembang, lacks, buddhist, stupas, or, sculptures, hinduism, was, also, practiced, in, srivijaya, this, is, based, on, the, discovery, of, the, bumiayu, temple, ruin, a, red, brick, shivaist, hindu, temple, compound, built, and, used, between, the, 8th, and, 13th, century, the, bumiayu, temple, site, is, located, by, the, banks, of, the, lematang, river, a, tributary, of, the, musi, river, this, temple, compound, was, probably, built, by, a, kedatuan, within, srivijaya, s, mandala, the, fact, that, a, hindu, temple, was, discovered, within, the, area, of, predominantly, buddhist, srivijaya, suggests, that, srivijaya, s, two, religious, groups, coexisted, quite, harmoniously, according, to, the, styles, of, shiva, and, agastya, statues, found, in, bumiayu, temple, 1, those, hindu, statues, are, dated, from, around, the, 9th, to, 10th, century, by, the, 12th, to, 13th, century, it, seems, that, the, faith, in, bumiayu, was, shifted, from, hinduism, to, tantric, buddhism, although, historical, records, and, archaeological, evidence, are, scarce, it, appears, that, by, the, 7th, century, srivijaya, had, established, suzerainty, over, large, areas, of, sumatra, western, java, and, much, of, the, malay, peninsula, initially, srivijaya, dominated, a, confederation, of, semi, autonomous, port, cities, in, the, region, through, nurturing, alliances, and, gaining, fealty, among, these, polities, regarding, its, status, as, the, central, port, of, the, region, it, seems, that, srivijaya, had, a, unique, ritual, policy, in, its, relations, with, the, dominant, powers, of, south, asia, southeast, asia, and, china, the, oldest, accounts, of, the, empire, come, from, arabic, and, chinese, traders, who, noted, in, their, travel, logs, of, the, importance, of, the, empire, in, regional, trade, its, location, was, instrumental, in, developing, itself, as, a, major, port, which, connected, china, the, middle, east, and, southeast, asia, control, of, the, malacca, and, sunda, straits, meant, it, controlled, both, the, spice, route, traffic, as, well, as, local, trade, charging, a, toll, on, passing, ships, serving, as, an, entrep, t, for, chinese, malay, and, indian, markets, the, port, of, palembang, accessible, from, the, coast, by, way, of, a, river, accumulated, great, wealth, instead, of, traveling, the, entire, distance, from, the, middle, east, to, china, which, would, have, taken, about, a, year, with, the, assistance, of, monsoon, winds, it, was, easier, to, stop, at, srivijaya, it, took, about, half, a, year, from, either, direction, to, reach, srivijaya, which, was, a, far, more, effective, and, efficient, use, of, manpower, and, resources, a, round, trip, from, one, end, to, srivijaya, and, back, would, take, the, same, amount, of, time, to, go, the, entire, distance, one, way, this, theory, has, been, supported, by, evidence, found, in, two, local, shipwrecks, one, off, the, coast, of, belitung, an, island, east, of, sumatra, and, another, near, cirebon, a, coastal, city, on, the, nearby, island, of, java, both, ships, carried, a, variety, of, foreign, cargo, and, in, the, case, of, the, belitung, wreck, had, foreign, origins, the, melayu, kingdom, was, the, first, rival, power, centre, absorbed, into, the, empire, and, thus, began, the, domination, of, the, region, through, trade, and, conquest, in, the, 7th, through, the, 9th, centuries, the, melayu, kingdom, s, gold, mines, in, the, batang, hari, river, hinterland, were, a, crucial, economic, resource, and, may, be, the, origin, of, the, word, suvarnadvipa, the, sanskrit, name, for, sumatra, srivijaya, helped, spread, malay, culture, throughout, sumatra, the, malay, peninsula, and, western, borneo, its, influence, waned, in, the, 11th, century, according, to, song, shi, a, song, dynasty, chronicle, sanfoqi, sent, their, envoys, for, the, last, time, in, 1178, then, in, 1225, chau, ju, kua, mentioned, that, palembang, srivijaya, was, a, vassal, kingdom, that, belonged, to, sanfoqi, this, means, that, between, 1178, and, 1225, the, srivijayan, kingdom, centred, in, palembang, was, defeated, by, the, malayu, kingdom, centred, in, jambi, thus, the, seat, of, the, empire, moved, to, muaro, jambi, in, the, last, centuries, of, the, kingdom, existence, 100, srivijaya, was, then, in, frequent, conflict, with, and, ultimately, subjugated, by, the, javanese, kingdoms, of, singhasari, and, later, majapahit, this, was, not, the, first, time, the, srivijayans, had, a, conflict, with, the, javanese, according, to, historian, paul, michel, munoz, the, javanese, sanjaya, dynasty, was, a, strong, rival, of, srivijaya, in, the, 8th, century, when, the, srivijayan, capital, was, located, in, java, the, khmer, empire, might, also, have, been, a, tributary, state, in, its, early, stages, it, is, mentioned, that, the, khmer, king, jayavarman, ii, spent, years, in, the, court, of, sailendra, in, java, before, returning, to, cambodia, to, rule, around, 790, influenced, by, the, javanese, culture, of, the, sailendran, srivijayan, mandala, and, likely, eager, to, emulate, the, javanese, model, in, his, court, he, proclaimed, cambodian, independence, from, java, and, ruled, as, devaraja, establishing, khmer, empire, and, starting, the, angkor, era, some, historians, claim, that, chaiya, in, surat, thani, province, in, southern, thailand, was, at, least, temporarily, the, capital, of, srivijaya, but, this, claim, is, widely, disputed, however, chaiya, was, probably, a, regional, centre, of, the, kingdom, srivijaya, also, maintained, close, relations, with, the, pala, empire, in, bengal, the, nalanda, inscription, dated, 860, records, that, maharaja, balaputra, dedicated, a, monastery, at, the, nalanda, university, in, pala, 109, the, relation, between, srivijaya, and, the, chola, dynasty, of, southern, india, was, initially, friendly, during, the, reign, of, raja, raja, chola, i, in, 1006, a, srivijayan, maharaja, from, the, sailendra, dynasty, king, maravijayattungavarman, constructed, the, chudamani, vihara, in, the, port, town, of, nagapattinam, however, during, the, reign, of, rajendra, chola, i, the, relationship, deteriorated, as, the, chola, dynasty, started, to, attack, srivijayan, cities, the, reason, for, this, sudden, change, in, the, relationship, with, the, chola, kingdom, is, not, fully, known, however, as, some, historians, suggest, that, the, khmer, king, suryavarman, i, of, the, khmer, empire, had, requested, aid, from, emperor, rajendra, chola, i, of, the, chola, dynasty, against, tambralinga, after, learning, of, suryavarman, s, alliance, with, rajendra, chola, the, tambralinga, kingdom, requested, aid, from, the, srivijaya, king, sangrama, vijayatungavarman, this, eventually, led, to, the, chola, empire, coming, into, conflict, with, srivijaya, the, conflict, ended, with, a, victory, for, the, chola, and, heavy, losses, for, srivijaya, and, the, capture, of, sangramavijayottungavarman, in, the, chola, raid, in, 1025, 142, 143, during, the, reign, of, kulothunga, chola, i, srivijaya, sent, an, embassy, to, the, chola, dynasty, although, srivijaya, left, few, archaeological, remains, and, was, almost, forgotten, in, the, collective, memory, of, maritime, southeast, asia, the, rediscovery, of, this, ancient, maritime, empire, by, c, d, s, in, the, 1920s, raised, the, notion, that, it, was, possible, for, a, widespread, political, entity, to, have, thrived, in, southeast, asia, in, the, past, modern, indonesian, historians, have, used, srivijaya, as, a, frame, of, reference, of, how, ancient, globalisation, foreign, relations, and, maritime, trade, have, shaped, asian, civilisation, an, important, legacy, of, srivijaya, was, its, language, unlike, some, inscriptions, of, srivijayan, contemporaries, tarumanagara, and, other, javanese, polities, that, use, sanskrit, srivijayan, inscriptions, were, written, in, old, malay, this, has, promoted, the, status, of, local, languages, to, the, same, status, as, sanskrit, as, the, language, of, the, elite, sanskrit, was, only, known, in, certain, circles, such, as, the, brahmin, and, kavi, while, old, malay, was, a, common, language, in, the, srivijayan, realm, this, linguistic, policy, probably, stemmed, from, the, rather, egalitarian, nature, of, mahayana, buddhism, adhered, to, in, srivijaya, in, contrast, to, the, elitist, nature, of, hinduism, unlike, hinduism, mahayana, buddhism, did, not, have, emphasize, on, a, caste, system, that, limited, the, use, and, knowledge, of, liturgical, language, to, the, brahmin, caste, for, centuries, srivijaya, through, its, expansion, economic, power, and, military, prowess, was, responsible, for, the, spread, of, old, malay, throughout, the, malay, archipelago, it, was, the, working, language, of, traders, being, used, in, various, ports, and, marketplaces, in, the, region, today, in, indonesian, artistic, tradition, songket, weaving, art, is, strongly, associated, with, palembang, and, to, a, certain, extent, west, sumatra, and, jambi, this, has, motivated, indonesian, historians, to, trace, the, origin, of, songket, and, its, possible, link, to, srivijaya, based, on, an, archaeological, study, on, the, bumiayu, temple, complex, in, penukal, abab, lematang, ilir, regency, south, sumatra, it, can, be, seen, that, songket, has, been, known, by, the, people, of, south, sumatra, since, the, 9th, century, a, textile, motif, known, today, in, palembang, songket, as, lepus, can, be, seen, on, the, vest, worn, by, figure, 1, statue, at, the, bumiayu, temple, complex, which, suggests, that, the, motif, that, has, been, around, since, the, 9th, century, this, archaeological, study, has, enforced, the, notion, that, songket, gold, thread, weaving, tradition, originated, in, srivijaya, modern, indonesian, nationalists, have, used, the, name, of, srivijaya, along, with, majapahit, as, a, source, of, pride, srivijaya, has, become, the, focus, of, national, pride, and, regional, identity, especially, for, the, people, of, palembang, south, sumatra, for, the, people, of, palembang, srivijaya, has,
