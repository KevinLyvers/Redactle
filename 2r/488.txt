havana, harbor, in, cuba, leading, to, united, states, intervention, in, the, cuban, war, of, independence, the, war, led, to, the, united, states, emerging, predominant, in, the, caribbean, region, and, resulted, in, u, s, acquisition, of, puerto, rico, guam, and, the, philippines, it, also, led, to, united, states, involvement, in, the, philippine, revolution, and, later, to, the, philippine, american, war, the, 19th, century, represented, a, clear, decline, for, the, spanish, empire, while, the, united, states, went, from, becoming, a, newly, founded, country, to, becoming, a, rising, power, spain, s, descent, had, begun, in, previous, centuries, and, accelerated, during, the, napoleonic, invasion, which, in, turn, triggered, the, independence, of, a, large, part, of, the, american, colonies, later, political, instability, including, declarations, of, independence, revolutions, and, civil, wars, cost, the, country, socially, and, economically, the, u, s, on, the, other, hand, expanded, economically, throughout, that, century, by, purchasing, territories, such, as, louisiana, and, alaska, militarily, by, actions, such, as, the, mexican, american, war, and, by, receiving, large, numbers, of, european, immigrants, that, process, was, interrupted, only, for, a, few, years, by, the, american, civil, war, and, reconstruction, era, the, main, issue, was, cuban, independence, revolts, had, been, occurring, for, some, years, in, cuba, against, spanish, colonial, rule, the, united, states, backed, these, revolts, upon, entering, the, spanish, american, war, there, had, been, war, scares, before, as, in, the, virginius, affair, in, 1873, but, in, the, late, 1890s, american, public, opinion, swayed, in, support, of, the, rebellion, because, of, reports, of, concentration, camps, set, up, to, control, the, populace, yellow, journalism, exaggerated, the, atrocities, to, further, increase, public, fervor, and, to, sell, more, newspapers, and, magazines, the, business, community, had, just, recovered, from, a, deep, depression, and, feared, that, a, war, would, reverse, the, gains, accordingly, most, business, interests, lobbied, vigorously, against, going, to, war, president, william, mckinley, ignored, the, exaggerated, news, reporting, and, sought, a, peaceful, settlement, though, not, seeking, a, war, mckinley, made, preparations, in, readiness, for, one, he, unsuccessfully, sought, accommodation, with, spain, on, the, issue, of, independence, for, cuba, however, after, the, u, s, navy, armored, cruiser, maine, mysteriously, exploded, and, sank, in, havana, harbor, on, february, 15, 1898, political, pressures, pushed, mckinley, into, a, war, that, he, had, wished, to, avoid, as, far, as, spain, was, concerned, there, was, a, nationalist, agitation, in, which, the, written, press, had, a, key, influence, causing, the, spanish, government, to, not, give, in, and, abandon, cuba, as, it, had, abandoned, spanish, florida, when, faced, with, a, troublesome, colonial, situation, there, transferring, it, to, the, u, s, in, 1821, in, exchange, for, payment, of, spanish, debts, if, the, spanish, government, had, transferred, cuba, it, would, have, been, seen, as, a, betrayal, by, a, part, of, spanish, society, and, there, would, probably, have, been, a, new, revolution, so, the, government, preferred, to, wage, a, war, lost, beforehand, in, order, to, preserve, the, restoration, regime, thereby, opting, for, a, controlled, demolition, rather, than, risking, a, revolution, on, april, 20, 1898, mckinley, signed, a, joint, congressional, resolution, demanding, spanish, withdrawal, and, authorizing, the, president, to, use, military, force, to, help, cuba, gain, independence, in, response, spain, severed, diplomatic, relations, with, the, united, states, on, april, 21, on, the, same, day, the, united, states, navy, began, a, blockade, of, cuba, both, sides, declared, war, neither, had, allies, the, war, was, fought, in, both, the, caribbean, and, the, pacific, american, war, advocates, correctly, anticipated, that, the, united, states, naval, power, would, prove, decisive, allowing, expeditionary, forces, to, disembark, in, cuba, against, a, spanish, garrison, already, facing, nationwide, cuban, insurgent, attacks, and, further, devastated, by, yellow, fever, the, invaders, obtained, the, surrender, of, santiago, de, cuba, and, manila, despite, the, good, performance, of, some, spanish, infantry, units, and, fierce, fighting, for, positions, such, as, el, caney, and, san, juan, hill, madrid, sued, for, peace, after, two, spanish, squadrons, were, sunk, in, the, battles, of, santiago, de, cuba, and, manila, bay, and, a, third, more, modern, fleet, was, recalled, home, to, protect, the, spanish, coasts, the, war, ended, with, the, 1898, treaty, of, paris, negotiated, on, terms, favorable, to, the, united, states, the, treaty, ceded, ownership, of, puerto, rico, guam, and, the, philippines, from, spain, to, the, united, states, and, granted, the, united, states, temporary, control, of, cuba, the, cession, of, the, philippines, involved, payment, of, 20, million, 730, million, today, to, spain, by, the, u, s, to, cover, infrastructure, owned, by, spain, the, spanish, american, war, brought, an, end, to, almost, four, centuries, of, spanish, presence, in, the, americas, asia, and, the, pacific, the, defeat, and, loss, of, the, spanish, empire, s, last, remnants, was, a, profound, shock, to, spain, s, national, psyche, and, provoked, a, thorough, philosophical, and, artistic, reevaluation, of, spanish, society, known, as, the, generation, of, 98, the, united, states, meanwhile, not, only, became, a, major, power, but, also, gained, several, island, possessions, spanning, the, globe, which, provoked, rancorous, debate, over, the, wisdom, of, expansionism, the, combined, problems, arising, from, the, peninsular, war, 1807, 1814, the, loss, of, most, of, its, colonies, in, the, americas, in, the, early, 19th, century, spanish, american, wars, of, independence, and, three, carlist, wars, 1832, 1876, marked, a, low, point, for, spanish, colonialism, liberal, spanish, elites, like, antonio, c, novas, del, castillo, and, emilio, castelar, offered, new, interpretations, of, the, concept, of, empire, to, dovetail, with, the, emerging, spanish, nationalism, c, novas, made, clear, in, an, address, to, the, university, of, madrid, in, 1882, his, view, of, the, spanish, nation, as, based, on, shared, cultural, and, linguistic, elements, on, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, that, tied, spain, s, territories, together, c, novas, saw, spanish, colonialism, as, more, benevolent, than, that, of, other, european, colonial, powers, the, prevalent, opinion, in, spain, before, the, war, regarded, the, spreading, of, civilization, and, christianity, as, spain, s, main, objective, and, contribution, to, the, new, world, the, concept, of, cultural, unity, bestowed, special, significance, on, cuba, which, had, been, spanish, for, almost, four, hundred, years, and, was, viewed, as, an, integral, part, of, the, spanish, nation, the, focus, on, preserving, the, empire, would, have, negative, consequences, for, spain, s, national, pride, in, the, aftermath, of, the, spanish, american, war, in, 1823, the, fifth, american, president, james, monroe, 1758, 1831, served, 1817, 25, enunciated, the, monroe, doctrine, which, stated, that, the, united, states, would, not, tolerate, further, efforts, by, european, governments, to, retake, or, expand, their, colonial, holdings, in, the, americas, or, to, interfere, with, the, newly, independent, states, in, the, hemisphere, the, u, s, would, however, respect, the, status, of, the, existing, european, colonies, before, the, american, civil, war, 1861, 1865, southern, interests, attempted, to, have, the, united, states, purchase, cuba, and, convert, it, into, a, new, slave, state, the, pro, slavery, element, proposed, the, ostend, manifesto, of, 1854, anti, slavery, forces, rejected, it, after, the, american, civil, war, and, cuba, s, ten, years, war, u, s, businessmen, began, monopolizing, the, devalued, sugar, markets, in, cuba, in, 1894, 90, of, cuba, s, total, exports, went, to, the, united, states, which, also, provided, 40, of, cuba, s, imports, cuba, s, total, exports, to, the, u, s, were, almost, twelve, times, larger, than, the, export, to, spain, u, s, business, interests, indicated, that, while, spain, still, held, political, authority, over, cuba, it, was, the, u, s, that, held, economic, power, over, cuba, the, u, s, became, interested, in, a, trans, isthmus, canal, in, either, nicaragua, or, panama, and, realized, the, need, for, naval, protection, captain, alfred, thayer, mahan, was, an, exceptionally, influential, theorist, his, ideas, were, much, admired, by, future, 26th, president, theodore, roosevelt, as, the, u, s, rapidly, built, a, powerful, naval, fleet, of, steel, warships, in, the, 1880s, and, 1890s, roosevelt, served, as, assistant, secretary, of, the, navy, from, 1897, to, 1898, and, was, an, aggressive, supporter, of, an, american, war, with, spain, over, cuban, interests, meanwhile, the, cuba, libre, movement, led, by, cuban, intellectual, jos, mart, until, he, died, in, 1895, had, established, offices, in, florida, the, face, of, the, cuban, revolution, in, the, u, s, was, the, cuban, junta, under, the, leadership, of, tom, s, estrada, palma, who, in, 1902, became, cuba, s, first, president, the, junta, dealt, with, leading, newspapers, and, washington, officials, and, held, fund, raising, events, across, the, u, s, it, funded, and, smuggled, weapons, it, mounted, an, extensive, propaganda, campaign, that, generated, enormous, popular, support, in, the, u, s, in, favor, of, the, cubans, protestant, churches, and, most, democrats, were, supportive, but, business, interests, called, on, washington, to, negotiate, a, settlement, and, avoid, war, cuba, attracted, enormous, american, attention, but, almost, no, discussion, involved, the, other, spanish, colonies, of, puerto, rico, also, in, the, caribbean, or, of, the, philippines, or, guam, historians, note, that, there, was, no, popular, demand, in, the, united, states, for, an, overseas, colonial, empire, the, first, serious, bid, for, cuban, independence, the, ten, years, war, erupted, in, 1868, and, was, subdued, by, the, authorities, a, decade, later, neither, the, fighting, nor, the, reforms, in, the, pact, of, zanj, n, february, 1878, quelled, the, desire, of, some, revolutionaries, for, wider, autonomy, and, ultimately, independence, one, such, revolutionary, jos, mart, continued, to, promote, cuban, financial, and, political, freedom, in, exile, in, early, 1895, after, years, of, organizing, mart, launched, a, three, pronged, invasion, of, the, island, the, plan, called, for, one, group, from, santo, domingo, in, the, dominican, republic, led, by, m, ximo, g, mez, one, group, from, costa, rica, led, by, antonio, maceo, grajales, and, another, from, the, united, states, preemptively, thwarted, by, u, s, officials, in, florida, to, land, in, different, places, on, the, island, and, provoke, an, uprising, while, their, call, for, revolution, the, grito, de, baire, was, successful, the, result, was, not, the, grand, show, of, force, mart, had, expected, with, a, quick, victory, effectively, lost, the, revolutionaries, settled, in, to, fight, a, protracted, guerrilla, campaign, antonio, c, novas, del, castillo, the, architect, of, spain, s, restoration, constitution, and, the, prime, minister, at, the, time, ordered, general, arsenio, mart, nez, campos, a, distinguished, veteran, of, the, war, against, the, previous, uprising, in, cuba, to, quell, the, revolt, campos, s, reluctance, to, accept, his, new, assignment, and, his, method, of, containing, the, revolt, to, the, province, of, oriente, earned, him, criticism, in, the, spanish, press, the, mounting, pressure, forced, c, novas, to, replace, general, campos, with, general, valeriano, weyler, a, soldier, who, had, experience, in, quelling, rebellions, in, overseas, provinces, and, the, spanish, metropole, weyler, deprived, the, insurgency, of, weaponry, supplies, and, assistance, by, ordering, the, residents, of, some, cuban, districts, to, move, to, reconcentration, areas, near, the, military, headquarters, this, strategy, was, effective, in, slowing, the, spread, of, rebellion, in, the, united, states, this, fueled, the, fire, of, anti, spanish, propaganda, in, a, political, speech, president, william, mckinley, used, this, to, ram, spanish, actions, against, armed, rebels, he, even, said, this, was, not, civilized, warfare, but, extermination, spain, depended, on, cuba, for, prestige, and, trade, and, used, it, as, a, training, ground, for, its, army, spanish, prime, minister, antonio, c, novas, del, castillo, announced, that, the, spanish, nation, is, disposed, to, sacrifice, to, the, last, peseta, of, its, treasure, and, to, the, last, drop, of, blood, of, the, last, spaniard, before, consenting, that, anyone, snatch, from, it, even, one, piece, of, its, territory, he, had, long, dominated, and, stabilized, spanish, politics, he, was, assassinated, in, 1897, by, italian, anarchist, michele, angiolillo, leaving, a, spanish, political, system, that, was, not, stable, and, could, not, risk, a, blow, to, its, prestige, the, eruption, of, the, cuban, revolt, weyler, s, measures, and, the, popular, fury, these, events, whipped, up, proved, to, be, a, boon, to, the, newspaper, industry, in, new, york, city, joseph, pulitzer, of, the, new, york, world, and, william, randolph, hearst, of, the, new, york, journal, recognized, the, potential, for, great, headlines, and, stories, that, would, sell, copies, both, papers, denounced, spain, but, had, little, influence, outside, new, york, american, opinion, generally, saw, spain, as, a, hopelessly, backward, power, that, was, unable, to, deal, fairly, with, cuba, american, catholics, were, divided, before, the, war, began, but, supported, it, enthusiastically, once, it, started, the, u, s, had, important, economic, interests, that, were, being, harmed, by, the, prolonged, conflict, and, deepening, uncertainty, about, cuba, s, future, shipping, firms, that, had, relied, heavily, on, trade, with, cuba, now, suffered, losses, as, the, conflict, continued, unresolved, these, firms, pressed, congress, and, mckinley, to, seek, an, end, to, the, revolt, other, american, business, concerns, specifically, those, who, had, invested, in, cuban, sugar, looked, to, the, spanish, to, restore, order, stability, not, war, was, the, goal, of, both, interests, how, stability, would, be, achieved, would, depend, largely, on, the, ability, of, spain, and, the, u, s, to, work, out, their, issues, diplomatically, lieutenant, commander, charles, train, in, 1894, in, his, preparatory, notes, in, an, outlook, of, an, armed, conflict, between, spain, and, the, united, states, wrote, that, cuba, was, solely, dependent, on, the, trade, activities, that, spain, was, carrying, out, and, that, it, would, mean, spain, would, use, their, entire, forces, to, defend, it, while, tension, increased, among, the, cubans, and, spanish, government, popular, support, of, intervention, began, to, spring, up, in, the, united, states, many, americans, likened, the, cuban, revolt, to, the, american, revolution, and, they, viewed, the, spanish, government, as, a, tyrannical, oppressor, historian, louis, p, rez, notes, that, the, proposition, of, war, in, behalf, of, cuban, independence, took, hold, immediately, and, held, on, thereafter, such, was, the, sense, of, the, public, mood, many, poems, and, songs, were, written, in, the, united, states, to, express, support, of, the, cuba, libre, movement, at, the, same, time, many, african, americans, facing, growing, racial, discrimination, and, increasing, retardation, of, their, civil, rights, wanted, to, take, part, in, the, war, they, saw, it, as, a, way, to, advance, the, cause, of, equality, service, to, country, hopefully, helping, to, gain, political, and, public, respect, amongst, the, wider, population, president, mckinley, well, aware, of, the, political, complexity, surrounding, the, conflict, wanted, to, end, the, revolt, peacefully, he, began, to, negotiate, with, the, spanish, government, hoping, that, the, talks, would, dampen, yellow, journalism, in, the, united, states, and, soften, support, for, war, with, spain, an, attempt, was, made, to, negotiate, a, peace, before, mckinley, took, office, however, the, spanish, refused, to, take, part, in, the, negotiations, in, 1897, mckinley, appointed, stewart, l, woodford, as, the, new, minister, to, spain, who, again, offered, to, negotiate, a, peace, in, october, 1897, the, spanish, government, refused, the, united, states, offer, to, negotiate, between, the, spanish, and, the, cubans, but, promised, the, u, s, it, would, give, the, cubans, more, autonomy, however, with, the, election, of, a, more, liberal, spanish, government, in, november, spain, began, to, change, its, policies, in, cuba, first, the, new, spanish, government, told, the, united, states, that, it, was, willing, to, offer, a, change, in, the, reconcentration, policies, if, the, cuban, rebels, agreed, to, a, cessation, of, hostilities, this, time, the, rebels, refused, the, terms, in, hopes, that, continued, conflict, would, lead, to, u, s, intervention, and, the, creation, of, an, independent, cuba, the, liberal, spanish, government, also, recalled, the, spanish, governor, general, valeriano, weyler, from, cuba, this, action, alarmed, many, cubans, loyal, to, spain, the, cubans, loyal, to, weyler, began, planning, large, demonstrations, to, take, place, when, the, next, governor, general, ram, n, blanco, arrived, in, cuba, u, s, consul, fitzhugh, lee, learned, of, these, plans, and, sent, a, request, to, the, u, s, state, department, to, send, a, u, s, warship, to, cuba, this, request, led, to, the, armored, cruiser, uss, maine, being, sent, to, cuba, while, maine, was, docked, in, havana, harbor, a, spontaneous, explosion, sank, the, ship, the, sinking, of, maine, was, blamed, on, the, spanish, and, made, the, possibility, of, a, negotiated, peace, very, slim, throughout, the, negotiation, process, the, major, european, powers, especially, britain, france, and, russia, generally, supported, the, american, position, and, urged, spain, to, give, in, spain, repeatedly, promised, specific, reforms, that, would, pacify, cuba, but, failed, to, deliver, american, patience, ran, out, mckinley, sent, uss, maine, to, havana, to, ensure, the, safety, of, american, citizens, and, interests, and, to, underscore, the, urgent, need, for, reform, naval, forces, were, moved, in, position, to, attack, simultaneously, on, several, fronts, if, the, war, was, not, avoided, as, maine, left, florida, a, large, part, of, the, north, atlantic, squadron, was, moved, to, key, west, and, the, gulf, of, mexico, others, were, also, moved, just, off, the, shore, of, lisbon, and, others, were, moved, to, hong, kong, too, at, 9, 40, p, m, on, february, 15, 1898, maine, sank, in, havana, harbor, after, suffering, a, massive, explosion, more, than, 3, 4, of, the, ship, s, crew, of, 355, sailors, officers, and, marines, died, as, a, result, of, the, explosion, of, the, 94, survivors, only, 16, were, uninjured, in, total, 260, servicemen, were, killed, in, the, initial, explosion, six, more, died, shortly, thereafter, from, injuries, marking, the, greatest, loss, of, life, for, the, american, military, in, a, single, day, since, the, defeat, at, little, bighorn, twenty, one, years, prior, 244, while, mckinley, urged, patience, and, did, not, declare, that, spain, had, caused, the, explosion, the, deaths, of, hundreds, of, american, sailors, held, the, public, s, attention, mckinley, asked, congress, to, appropriate, 50, million, for, defense, and, congress, unanimously, obliged, most, american, leaders, believed, that, the, cause, of, the, explosion, was, unknown, still, public, attention, was, now, riveted, on, the, situation, and, spain, could, not, find, a, diplomatic, solution, to, avoid, war, spain, appealed, to, the, european, powers, most, of, whom, advised, it, to, accept, u, s, conditions, for, cuba, in, order, to, avoid, war, germany, urged, a, united, european, stand, against, the, united, states, but, took, no, action, the, u, s, navy, s, investigation, made, public, on, march, 28, concluded, that, the, ship, s, powder, magazines, were, ignited, when, an, external, explosion, was, set, off, under, the, ship, s, hull, this, report, poured, fuel, on, popular, indignation, in, the, u, s, making, war, virtually, inevitable, spain, s, investigation, came, to, the, opposite, conclusion, the, explosion, originated, within, the, ship, other, investigations, in, later, years, came, to, various, contradictory, conclusions, but, had, no, bearing, on, the, coming, of, the, war, in, 1974, admiral, hyman, george, rickover, had, his, staff, look, at, the, documents, and, decided, there, was, an, internal, explosion, a, study, commissioned, by, national, geographic, magazine, in, 1999, using, ame, computer, modeling, reported, by, examining, the, bottom, plating, of, the, ship, and, how, it, bent, and, folded, ame, concluded, that, the, destruction, could, have, been, caused, by, a, mine, after, maine, was, destroyed, new, york, city, newspaper, publishers, hearst, and, pulitzer, decided, that, the, spanish, were, to, blame, and, they, publicized, this, theory, as, fact, in, their, papers, even, prior, to, the, explosion, both, had, published, sensationalistic, accounts, of, atrocities, committed, by, the, spanish, in, cuba, headlines, such, as, spanish, murderers, were, commonplace, in, their, newspapers, following, the, explosion, this, tone, escalated, with, the, headline, remember, the, maine, to, hell, with, spain, quickly, appearing, their, press, exaggerated, what, was, happening, and, how, the, spanish, were, treating, the, cuban, prisoners, the, stories, were, based, on, factual, accounts, but, most, of, the, time, the, articles, that, were, published, were, embellished, and, written, with, incendiary, language, causing, emotional, and, often, heated, responses, among, readers, a, common, myth, falsely, states, that, when, illustrator, frederic, remington, said, there, was, no, war, brewing, in, cuba, hearst, responded, you, furnish, the, pictures, and, i, ll, furnish, the, war, however, this, new, yellow, journalism, was, uncommon, outside, new, york, city, and, historians, no, longer, consider, it, the, major, force, shaping, the, national, mood, public, opinion, nationwide, did, demand, immediate, action, overwhelming, the, efforts, of, president, mckinley, speaker, of, the, house, thomas, brackett, reed, and, the, business, community, to, find, a, negotiated, solution, wall, street, big, business, high, finance, and, main, street, businesses, across, the, country, were, vocally, opposed, to, war, and, demanded, peace, after, years, of, severe, depression, the, economic, outlook, for, the, domestic, economy, was, suddenly, bright, again, in, 1897, however, the, uncertainties, of, warfare, posed, a, serious, threat, to, full, economic, recovery, war, would, impede, the, march, of, prosperity, and, put, the, country, back, many, years, warned, the, new, jersey, trade, review, the, leading, railroad, magazine, editorialized, from, a, commercial, and, mercenary, standpoint, it, seems, peculiarly, bitter, that, this, war, should, come, when, the, country, had, already, suffered, so, much, and, so, needed, rest, and, peace, mckinley, paid, close, attention, to, the, strong, antiwar, consensus, of, the, business, community, and, strengthened, his, resolve, to, use, diplomacy, and, negotiation, rather, than, brute, force, to, end, the, spanish, tyranny, in, cuba, historian, nick, kapur, argues, that, mckinley, s, actions, as, he, moved, toward, war, were, rooted, not, in, various, pressure, groups, but, in, his, deeply, held, victorian, values, especially, arbitration, pacifism, humanitarianism, and, manly, self, restraint, a, speech, delivered, by, republican, senator, redfield, proctor, of, vermont, on, march, 17, 1898, thoroughly, analyzed, the, situation, and, greatly, strengthened, the, pro, war, cause, proctor, concluded, that, war, was, the, only, answer, many, in, the, business, and, religious, communities, which, had, until, then, opposed, war, switched, sides, leaving, mckinley, and, speaker, reed, almost, alone, in, their, resistance, to, a, war, on, april, 11, mckinley, ended, his, resistance, and, asked, congress, for, authority, to, send, american, troops, to, cuba, to, end, the, civil, war, there, knowing, that, congress, would, force, a, war, on, april, 19, while, congress, was, considering, joint, resolutions, supporting, cuban, independence, republican, senator, henry, m, teller, of, colorado, proposed, the, teller, amendment, to, ensure, that, the, u, s, would, not, establish, permanent, control, over, cuba, after, the, war, the, amendment, disclaiming, any, intention, to, annex, cuba, passed, the, senate, 42, to, 35, the, house, concurred, the, same, day, 311, to, 6, the, amended, resolution, demanded, spanish, withdrawal, and, authorized, the, president, to, use, as, much, military, force, as, he, thought, necessary, to, help, cuba, gain, independence, from, spain, president, mckinley, signed, the, joint, resolution, on, april, 20, 1898, and, the, ultimatum, was, sent, to, spain, in, response, spain, severed, diplomatic, relations, with, the, united, states, on, april, 21, on, the, same, day, the, u, s, navy, began, a, blockade, of, cuba, on, april, 23, spain, reacted, to, the, blockade, by, declaring, war, on, the, u, s, on, april, 25, the, u, s, congress, responded, in, kind, declaring, that, a, state, of, war, between, the, u, s, and, spain, had, de, facto, existed, since, april, 21, the, day, the, blockade, of, cuba, had, begun, it, was, the, embodiment, of, the, naval, plan, created, by, lieutenant, commander, charles, train, four, years, ago, stating, once, the, us, enacted, a, proclamation, of, war, against, spain, it, would, mobilize, its, n, a, north, atlantic, squadron, to, form, an, efficient, blockade, in, havana, matanzas, and, sagua, la, grande, the, navy, was, ready, but, the, army, was, not, well, prepared, for, the, war, and, made, radical, changes, in, plans, and, quickly, purchased, supplies, in, the, spring, of, 1898, the, strength, of, the, u, s, regular, army, was, just, 24, 593, soldiers, the, army, wanted, 50, 000, new, men, but, received, over, 220, 000, through, volunteers, and, the, mobilization, of, state, national, guard, units, even, gaining, nearly, 100, 000, men, on, the, first, night, after, the, explosion, of, uss, maine, president, mckinley, issued, two, calls, for, volunteers, the, first, on, april, 23, which, called, for, 125, 000, men, to, enlist, followed, by, a, second, appeal, for, a, further, 75, 000, volunteers, states, in, the, northeast, midwest, and, the, west, quickly, filled, their, volunteer, quota, in, response, to, the, surplus, influx, of, volunteers, several, northern, states, had, their, quotas, increased, contrastingly, some, southern, states, struggled, to, fulfil, even, the, first, mandated, quota, namely, alabama, kentucky, mississippi, north, carolina, south, carolina, and, virginia, the, majority, of, states, did, not, allow, african, american, men, to, volunteer, which, impeded, recruitment, in, southern, states, especially, those, with, large, african, american, populations, quota, requirements, based, on, total, population, were, unmanageable, as, they, were, disproportionate, compared, to, the, actual, population, permitted, to, volunteer, this, was, especially, evident, in, some, states, such, as, kentucky, and, mississippi, which, accepted, out, of, state, volunteers, to, aid, in, meeting, their, quotas, this, southern, apprehension, towards, enlistment, can, also, be, attributed, to, a, war, weariness, derived, from, the, confederacy, s, defeat, in, the, civil, war, many, in, the, south, were, still, recuperating, financially, after, their, losses, in, the, civil, war, and, the, upcoming, war, did, not, provide, much, hope, for, economic, prosperity, in, the, south, the, prospect, of, a, naval, war, gave, anxiety, to, those, in, the, south, the, financial, security, of, those, working, and, living, in, the, cotton, belt, relied, heavily, upon, trade, across, the, atlantic, which, would, be, disrupted, by, a, nautical, war, the, prospect, of, which, fostered, a, reluctance, to, enlist, potential, volunteers, were, also, not, financially, incentivized, with, pay, per, month, initially, being, 13, 00, which, then, was, then, raised, to, 15, 60, for, combat, pay, it, was, more, economically, promising, for, most, southern, men, to, continue, in, their, own, enterprises, rather, than, enlist, the, overwhelming, consensus, of, observers, in, the, 1890s, and, historians, ever, since, is, that, an, upsurge, of, humanitarian, concern, with, the, plight, of, the, cubans, was, the, main, motivating, force, that, caused, the, war, with, spain, in, 1898, mckinley, put, it, succinctly, in, late, 1897, that, if, spain, failed, to, resolve, its, crisis, the, united, states, would, see, a, duty, imposed, by, our, obligations, to, ourselves, to, civilization, and, humanity, to, intervene, with, force, intervention, in, terms, of, negotiating, a, settlement, proved, impossible, neither, spain, nor, the, insurgents, would, agree, louis, perez, states, certainly, the, moralistic, determinants, of, war, in, 1898, has, been, accorded, preponderant, explanatory, weight, in, the, historiography, by, the, 1950s, however, american, political, scientists, began, attacking, the, war, as, a, mistake, based, on, idealism, arguing, that, a, better, policy, would, be, realism, they, discredited, the, idealism, by, suggesting, the, people, were, deliberately, misled, by, propaganda, and, sensationalist, yellow, journalism, political, scientist, robert, osgood, writing, in, 1953, led, the, attack, on, the, american, decision, process, as, a, confused, mix, of, self, righteousness, and, genuine, moral, fervor, in, the, form, of, a, crusade, and, a, combination, of, knight, errantry, and, national, self, assertiveness, osgood, argued, in, his, war, and, empire, prof, paul, atwood, of, the, university, of, massachusetts, boston, writes, the, spanish, american, war, was, fomented, on, outright, lies, and, trumped, up, accusations, against, the, intended, enemy, war, fever, in, the,

our, fleet, which, overmatches, anything, the, spanish, have, is, masked, at, the, dry, tortugas, in, his, autobiography, theodore, roosevelt, gave, his, views, of, the, origins, of, the, war, our, own, direct, interests, were, great, because, of, the, cuban, tobacco, and, sugar, and, especially, because, of, cuba, s, relation, to, the, projected, isthmian, canal, but, even, greater, were, our, interests, from, the, standpoint, of, humanity, it, was, our, duty, even, more, from, the, standpoint, of, national, honor, than, from, the, standpoint, of, national, interest, to, stop, the,

as, the, american, action, of, preventing, filipino, forces, from, entering, the, captured, city, of, manila, was, deeply, resented, by, the, filipinos, this, later, led, to, the, philippine, american, war, which, would, prove, to, be, more, deadly, and, costly, than, the, spanish, american, war, the, u, s, had, sent, a, force, of, some, 11, 000, ground, troops, to, the, philippines, on, august, 14, 1898, spanish, captain, general, jaudenes, formally, capitulated, and, u, s, general, merritt, formally, accepted, the, surrender, and, declared, the, establishment, of, a, u, s, military,

key, to, its, independence, and, even, annexation, was, considered, for, a, time, which, historian, louis, p, rez, explored, in, his, book, cuba, and, the, united, states, ties, of, singular, intimacy, the, cubans, harbored, a, great, deal, of, discontent, towards, the, spanish, government, a, result, of, years, of, manipulation, on, the, part, of, the, spanish, the, prospect, of, getting, the, united, states, involved, in, the, fight, was, considered, by, many, cubans, as, a, step, in, the, right, direction, while, the, cubans, were, wary, of, the, united, states, intentions, the, overwhelming, support, from, the, american, public, provided, the, cubans, with, some, peace, of, mind, because, they, believed, that, the, united, states, was, committed, to, helping, them, achieve, their, independence, the, first, combat, between, american, and, spanish, forces, in, the, caribbean, occurred, on, may, 11, 1898, in, the, harbor, near, the, city, of, cienfuegos, the, city, was, the, southern, terminus, for, undersea, communication, cables, that, connected, cuba, to, spain, and, other, spanish, holdings, in, the, caribbean, american, naval, officers, needed, to, destroy, these, cables, to, cut, communications, into, and, out, of, cuba, in, preparation, for, later, operations, against, the, major, city, of, santiago, the, uss, marblehead, and, the, uss, nashville, were, dispatched, to, cut, these, cables, early, on, the, morning, of, may, 11, to, cut, the, cables, two, steam, cutters, with, a, crew, of, eight, sailors, and, six, marines, each, and, two, sailing, launches, with, a, crew, of, fourteen, sailors, each, maneuvered, into, harbor, and, within, 200, feet, from, shore, while, the, boats, moved, towards, shore, the, marblehead, and, nashville, shelled, spanish, trenches, dug, to, protect, the, cables, from, sabotage, attempts, they, succeeded, in, destroying, support, buildings, for, the, cables, and, drove, the, spanish, force, back, away, from, the, beach, the, boats, crews, pulled, one, cable, up, and, began, trying, to, cut, through, its, metal, jacket, while, spanish, soldiers, started, firing, from, cover, marine, sharpshooters, returned, fire, from, the, boats, and, the, marblehead, and, nashville, began, firing, shrapnel, shells, in, an, attempt, to, force, the, spanish, completely, out, of, the, area, the, sailors, finished, cutting, one, cable, and, pulled, up, a, second, one, to, begin, severing, it, too, spanish, fire, began, to, take, a, toll, on, the, marines, and, sailors, with, multiple, casualties, in, the, small, boats, but, the, americans, were, still, able, to, cut, a, second, wire, they, began, working, on, the, final, wire, and, succeeded, in, partially, cutting, it, until, the, still, heavy, spanish, fire, and, mounting, casualties, forced, the, navy, officer, in, command, lieutenant, e, a, anderson, to, order, the, boats, to, return, to, the, cover, of, the, larger, vessels, in, the, almost, three, hours, of, combat, two, men, were, killed, two, mortally, wounded, and, four, more, seriously, wounded, and, they, succeeded, in, severing, two, of, the, three, cables, running, out, of, cienfuegos, this, relatively, brief, fight, significantly, disrupted, communications, between, cuba, santiago, and, spain, and, contributed, to, the, overall, american, goal, of, isolating, cuba, from, outside, support, it, also, provided, a, major, boost, to, american, morale, because, it, was, the, first, combat, american, servicemen, had, seen, close, to, home, for, their, brave, actions,

charleston, south, carolina, and, then, head, for, the, caribbean, to, make, port, at, san, juan, havana, or, santiago, de, cuba, but, in, the, end, this, idea, was, dropped, meanwhile, u, s,

philippines, was, of, great, concern, to, the, united, states, which, hastily, arranged, to, dispatch, 10, 000, additional, u, s, army, troops, to, the, philippines, and, send, two, u, s, navy, monitors, to, reinforce, dewey, on, 15, june, c, mara, finally, received, orders, to, depart, immediately, for, the, philippines, his, squadron, made, up, of, pelayo, his, flagship, emperador, carlos,

philippines, guam, and, puerto, rico, in, the, treaty, and, cuba, became, a, u, s, protectorate, the, treaty, came, into, force, in, cuba, april, 11, 1899, with, cubans, participating, only, as, observers, having, been, occupied, since, july, 17, 1898, and, thus, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, united, states, military, government, usmg, cuba, formed, its, own, civil, government, and, gained, independence, on, may, 20, 1902, with, the, announced, end, of, usmg, jurisdiction, over, the, island, however, the, u, s, imposed, various, restrictions, on, the, new, government, including, prohibiting, alliances, with, other, countries, and, reserved, the, right, to, intervene, the, u, s, also, established, a, de, facto, perpetual, lease, of, guant, namo, bay, the, war, lasted, 16, weeks, john, hay, the, united, states, ambassador, to, the, united, kingdom, writing, from, london, to, his, friend, theodore, roosevelt, declared, that, it, had, been, a, splendid, little, war, the, press, showed, northerners, and, southerners, blacks, and, whites, fighting, against, a, common, foe, helping, to, ease, the, scars, left, from, the, american, civil, war, exemplary, of, this, was, that, four, former, confederate, states, army, generals, had, served, in, the, war, now, in, the, u, s, army, and, all, of, them, again, carrying, similar, ranks, these, officers, were, matthew, butler, fitzhugh, lee, thomas, l, rosser, and, joseph, wheeler, though, only, the, latter, had, seen, action, still, in, an, exciting, moment, during, the, battle, of, san, juan, hill, wheeler, apparently, forgot, for, a, moment, which, war, he, was, fighting, having, supposedly, called, out, let, s, go, boys, we, ve, got, the, damn, yankees, on, the, run, again, the, war, marked, american, entry, into, world, affairs, since, then, the, u, s, has, had, a, significant, hand, in, various, conflicts, around, the, world, and, entered, many, treaties, and, agreements, the, panic, of, 1893, was, over, by, this, point, and, the, u, s, entered, a, long, and, prosperous, period, of, economic, and, population, growth, and, technological, innovation, that, lasted, through, the, 1920s, the, war, redefined, national, identity, served, as, a, solution, of, sorts, to, the, social, divisions, plaguing, the, american, mind, and, provided, a, model, for, all, future, news, reporting, the, idea, of, american, imperialism, changed, in, the, public, s, mind, after, the, short, and, successful, spanish, american, war, because, of, the, united, states, powerful, influence, diplomatically, and, militarily, cuba, s, status, after, the, war, relied, heavily, upon, american, actions, two, major, developments, emerged, from, the, spanish, american, war, one, it, firmly, established, the, united, states, vision, of, itself, as, a, defender, of, democracy, and, as, a, major, world, power, and, two, it, had, severe, implications, for, cuban, american, relations, in, the, future, as, historian, louis, p, rez, argued, in, his, book, cuba, in, the, american, imagination, metaphor, and, the, imperial, ethos, the, spanish, american, war, of, 1898, fixed, permanently, how, americans, came, to, think, of, themselves, a, righteous, people, given, to, the, service, of, righteous, purpose, described, as, absurd, and, useless, by, much, of, historiography, the, war, against, the, united, states, was, sustained, by, an, internal, logic, in, the, idea, that, it, was, not, possible, to, maintain, the, monarchical, regime, if, it, was, not, from, a, more, than, predictable, military, defeat, a, similar, point, of, view, that, is, shared, by, carlos, dard, once, the, war, was, raised, the, spanish, government, believed, that, it, had, no, other, solution, than, to, fight, and, lose, they, thought, that, defeat, certain, was, preferable, to, revolution, also, certain, granting, independence, to, cuba, without, being, defeated, militarily, it, would, have, implied, in, spain, more, than, likely, a, military, coup, d, tat, with, broad, popular, support, and, the, fall, of, the, monarchy, that, is, the, revolution, as, the, head, of, the, spanish, delegation, to, the, paris, peace, negotiations, the, liberal, eugenio, montero, r, os, said, everything, has, been, lost, except, the, monarchy, or, as, the, u, s, ambassador, in, madrid, said, the, politicians, of, the, dynastic, parties, preferred, the, odds, of, a, war, with, the, certainty, of, losing, cuba, to, the, dethronement, of, the, monarchy, there, were, spanish, officers, in, cuba, who, expressed, the, conviction, that, the, government, of, madrid, had, the, deliberate, intention, that, the, squadron, be, destroyed, as, soon, as, possible, in, order, to, quickly, reach, peace, although, there, was, nothing, exceptional, about, the, defeat, in, the, context, of, the, time, fachoda, incident, 1890, british, ultimatum, first, italo, ethiopian, war, greco, turkish, war, 1897, century, of, humiliation, russo, japanese, war, among, other, examples, in, spain, the, result, of, the, war, caused, a, national, trauma, due, to, the, affinity, of, peninsular, spaniards, with, cuba, but, only, in, the, intellectual, class, which, gave, rise, to, regenerationism, and, the, generation, of, 98, because, the, majority, of, the, population, was, illiterate, and, lived, under, the, regime, of, caciquismo, the, war, greatly, reduced, the, spanish, empire, spain, had, been, declining, as, an, imperial, power, since, the, early, 19th, century, as, a, result, of, napoleon, s, invasion, spain, retained, only, a, handful, of, overseas, holdings, spanish, west, africa, spanish, sahara, spanish, guinea, spanish, morocco, and, the, canary, islands, with, the, loss, of, the, philippines, spain, s, remaining, pacific, possessions, in, the, caroline, islands, and, mariana, islands, became, untenable, and, were, sold, to, germany, in, the, german, spanish, treaty, 1899, the, spanish, soldier, julio, cervera, baviera, who, served, in, the, puerto, rican, campaign, published, a, pamphlet, in, which, he, blamed, the, natives, of, that, colony, for, its, occupation, by, the, americans, saying, i, have, never, seen, such, a, servile, ungrateful, country, in, twenty, four, hours, the, people, of, puerto, rico, went, from, being, fervently, spanish, to, enthusiastically, american, they, humiliated, themselves, giving, in, to, the, invader, as, the, slave, bows, to, the, powerful, lord, he, was, challenged, to, a, duel, by, a, group, of, young, puerto, ricans, for, writing, this, pamphlet, culturally, a, new, wave, called, the, generation, of, 98, originated, as, a, response, to, this, trauma, marking, a, renaissance, in, spanish, culture, economically, the, war, benefited, spain, because, after, the, war, large, sums, of, capital, held, by, spaniards, in, cuba, and, the, united, states, were, returned, to, the, peninsula, and, invested, in, spain, this, massive, flow, of, capital, equivalent, to, 25, of, the, gross, domestic, product, of, one, year, helped, to, develop, the, large, modern, firms, in, spain, in, the, steel, chemical, financial, mechanical, textile, shipyard, and, electrical, power, industries, however, the, political, consequences, were, serious, the, defeat, in, the, war, began, the, weakening, of, the, fragile, political, stability, that, had, been, established, earlier, by, the, rule, of, alfonso, xii, a, few, years, after, the, war, during, the, reign, of, alfonso, xiii, spain, improved, its, commercial, position, and, maintained, close, relations, with, the, united, states, which, led, to, the, signing, of, commercial, treaties, between, the, two, countries, in, 1902, 1906, and, 1910, spain, would, turn, its, attention, to, its, possessions, in, africa, especially, northern, morocco, spanish, sahara, and, spanish, guinea, and, would, begin, to, rehabilitate, itself, internationally, after, the, algeciras, conference, of, 1906, in, 1907, it, signed, a, kind, of, defensive, alliance, with, france, and, the, united, kingdom, known, as, the, pact, of, cartagena, in, case, of, war, against, the, triple, alliance, spain, improved, economically, because, of, its, neutrality, in, the, first, world, war, the, teller, amendment, was, passed, in, the, senate, on, april, 19, 1898, with, a, vote, of, 42, for, versus, 35, against, on, april, 20, it, was, passed, by, the, house, of, representatives, with, a, vote, of, 311, for, versus, 6, against, and, signed, into, law, by, president, william, mckinley, effectively, it, was, a, promise, from, the, united, states, to, the, cuban, people, that, it, was, not, declaring, war, to, annex, cuba, but, would, help, in, gaining, its, independence, from, spain, the, platt, amendment, was, a, move, by, the, united, states, government, to, shape, cuban, affairs, to, promote, american, interests, without, violating, the, teller, amendment, the, platt, amendment, granted, the, united, states, the, right, to, stabilize, cuba, militarily, as, needed, it, permitted, the, united, states, to, deploy, marines, to, cuba, if, cuban, freedom, and, independence, were, ever, threatened, or, jeopardized, by, an, external, or, internal, force, passed, as, a, rider, to, an, army, appropriations, bill, which, was, signed, into, law, on, 2, march, 1903, it, effectively, prohibited, cuba, from, signing, treaties, with, other, nations, or, contracting, a, public, debt, it, also, provided, for, a, permanent, american, naval, base, in, cuba, guant, namo, bay, was, established, after, the, signing, of, the, cuban, american, treaty, of, relations, in, 1903, the, u, s, compelled, cuban, assent, by, insinuating, american, forces, would, not, be, withdrawn, otherwise, thus, despite, that, cuba, technically, gained, its, independence, after, the, war, ended, the, united, states, government, ensured, that, it, had, some, form, of, power, and, control, over, cuban, affairs, the, u, s, annexed, the, former, spanish, colonies, of, puerto, rico, the, philippines, and, guam, the, notion, of, the, united, states, as, an, imperial, power, with, colonies, was, hotly, debated, domestically, with, president, mckinley, and, the, pro, imperialists, winning, their, way, over, vocal, opposition, led, by, democrat, william, jennings, bryan, who, had, supported, the, war, the, american, public, largely, supported, the, possession, of, colonies, but, there, were, many, outspoken, critics, such, as, mark, twain, who, wrote, the, war, prayer, in, protest, roosevelt, returned, to, the, united, states, a, war, hero, and, he, was, soon, elected, governor, of, new, york, and, then, became, the, vice, president, at, the, age, of, 42, he, became, the, youngest, person, to, become, president, after, the, assassination, of, president, mckinley, the, war, served, to, further, repair, relations, between, the, american, north, and, south, the, war, gave, both, sides, a, common, enemy, for, the, first, time, since, the, end, of, the, civil, war, in, 1865, and, many, friendships, were, formed, between, soldiers, of, northern, and, southern, states, during, their, tours, of, duty, this, was, an, important, development, since, many, soldiers, in, this, war, were, the, children, of, civil, war, veterans, on, both, sides, the, african,

african, american, seamen, had, died, in, the, maine, explosion, the, most, influential, black, leader, booker, t, washington, argued, that, his, race, was, ready, to, fight, war, offered, them, a, chance, to, render, service, to, our, country, that, no, other, race, can, because, unlike, whites, they, were, accustomed, to, the, peculiar, and, dangerous, climate, of, cuba, one, of, the, black, units, that, served, in, the, war, was, the, 9th, cavalry, regiment, in, march, 1898, washington, promised, the, secretary, of, the, navy, that, war, would, be, answered, by, at, least, ten, thousand, loyal, brave, strong, black, men, in, the, south, who, crave, an, opportunity, to, show, their, loyalty, to, our, land, and, would, gladly, take, this, method, of, showing, their, gratitude, for, the,

foreign, wars, of, the, united, states, vfw, was, formed, in, 1914, from, the, merger, of, two, veterans, organizations, which, both, arose, in, 1899, the, american, veterans, of, foreign, service, and, the, national, society, of, the, army, of, the, philippines, the, former, was, formed, for, veterans, of, the, spanish, american, war, while, the, latter, was, formed, for, veterans, of, the, philippine, american, war, both, organizations, were, formed, in, response, to, the, general, neglect, veterans, returning, from, the, war, experienced, at, the, hands, of, the, government, to, pay, the, costs, of, the, war, congress, passed, an, excise, tax, on, long, distance, phone, service, at, the, time, it, affected, only, wealthy, americans, who, owned, telephones, however, the, congress, neglected, to, repeal, the, tax, after, the, war, ended, four, months, later, the, tax, remained, in, place, for, over, 100, years, until, on, august, 1, 2006, it, was, announced, that, the, u, s, department, of, the, treasury, and, the, irs, would, no, longer, collect, it, the, u, s, marine, corps, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, was, primarily, a, ship, borne, force, marines, were, assigned, to, naval, vessels, to, protect, the, ship, s, crew, during, close, quarters, combat, man, secondary, batteries, and, provide, landing, parties, when, the, ship, s, captain, needed, them, during, the, mexican, american, war, and, the, civil, war, the, marine, corps, participated, in, some, amphibious, landings, and, had, limited, coordination, with, the, army, and, navy, in, their, operations, during, the, spanish, american, war, though, the, marines, conducted, several, successful, combined, operations, with, both, the, army, and, the, navy, marine, forces, helped, in, the, army, led, assault, on, santiago, and, marines, also, supported, the, navy, s, operations, by, securing, the, entrance, to, guantanamo, bay, so, american, vessels, could, clear, the, harbor, of, mines, and, use, it, as, a, refueling, station, without, fear, of, spanish, harassment, doctrinally, the, army, and, the, navy, did, not, agree, on, much, of, anything, and, navy, officers, were, often, frustrated, by, the, lack, of, army, support, having, the, marine, corps, alleviated, some, of, this, conflict, because, it, gave, navy, commanders, a, force, always, under, the, direction, of, the, senior, naval, officer, without, any, conflict, of, authority, with, the, army, the, combined, marine, corps, navy, operations, during, the, war, also, signaled, the, future, relationship, between, the, two, services, during, the, banana, wars, of, the, early, 20th, century, the, island, hopping, campaigns, in, the, pacific, during, world, war, ii, and, into, modern, conflicts, america, is, involved, in, the, marine, corps, and, navy, operate, as, a, team, to, secure, american, interests, thanks, to, the, new, territorial, acquisitions, of, guam, the, philippines, puerto, rico, and, cuba, america, needed, the, capabilities, the, marines, could, provide, the, spanish, american, war, was, also, the, first, time, that, the, marine, corps, acted, as, america, s, force, in, readiness, because, they, were, the, first, american, force, to, land, on, cuba, being, a, body, of, troops, which, can, be, quickly, mobilized, and, sent, on, board, transports, fully, equipped, for, service, ashore, and, afloat, became, the, marine, corps, mission, throughout, the, rest, of, the, 20th, century, and, into, the, 21st, century, the, spanish, american, war, also, served, as, a, coming, of, age, for, several, influential, marines, lieutenants, smedley, d, butler, john, a, lejeune, and, wendell, c, neville, and, captain, george, f, elliott, all, served, with, distinction, with, the, first, battalion, that, fought, in, cuba, lieutenant, butler, would, go, on, to, earn, two, medals, of, honor, in, veracruz, and, haiti, lieutenants, lejeune, and, neville, and, captain, elliott, would, all, become, commandants, of, the, marine, corps, the, highest, rank, in, the, service, and, the, leader, of, the, entire, corps, marines, actions, during, the, spanish, american, war, also, provided, significant, positive, press, for, the, corps, the, men, of, the, first, battalion, were, welcomed, as, heroes, when, they, returned, to, the, states, and, many, stories, were, published, by, journalists, attached, to, the, unit, about, their, bravery, during, the, battle, of, guantanamo, the, marine, corps, began, to, be, regarded, as, america, s, premier, fighting, force, thanks, in, large, part, to, the, actions, of, marines, during, the, spanish, american, war, and, to, the, reporters, who, covered, their, exploits, the, success, of, the, marines, also, led, to, increased, funding, for, the, corps, from, congress, during, a, time, that, many, high, placed, navy, officials, were, questioning, the, efficacy, and, necessity, of, the, marine, corps, this, battle, for, congressional, funding, and, support, would, continue, until, the, national, security, act, of, 1947, but, marine, actions, at, guantanamo, and, in, the, philippines, provided, a, major, boost, to, the, corps, status, article, ix, of, the, treaty, of, paris, stated, that, the, u, s, congress, were, responsible, for, decisions, regarding, the, civil, and, political, rights, of, the, indigenous, populations, of, the, newly, acquired, territories, of, the, philippines, puerto, rico, and, guam, there, was, initial, reluctance, in, congress, to, set, firm, plans, for, the, once, spanish, islands, the, debate, of, whether, to, retain, the, islands, or, give, them, independence, eventually, became, the, core, debating, and, campaigning, issue, of, the, 1900, election, with, mckinley, s, victory, congress, began, to, pass, legislation, that, marked, the, united, states, deliberate, turn, toward, imperialism, in, 1900, congress, enacted, the, foraker, act, this, established, that, puerto, ricans, would, not, have, u, s, citizenship, despite, being, under, u, s, sovereignty, instead, the, act, declared, that, they, were, only, citizens, of, porto, rico, and, therefore, would, not, gain, the, civil, political, or, constitutional, rights, that, came, with, u, s, citizenship, the, foraker, act, also, established, a, system, of, taxation, puerto, ricans, were, required, to, pay, tax, to, fund, the, imposed, system, of, government, and, goods, imported, from, the, u, s, to, puerto, rico, had, tariffs, placed, upon, them, the, act, implemented, a, new, system, of, government, in, puerto, rico, with, the, u, s, president, holding, the, sole, power, to, appoint, the, governor, and, upper, legislative, chamber, puerto, ricans, were, able, to, elect, the, lower, legislative, chamber, delegates, and, a, resident, commissioner, to, represent, them, in, washington, although, the, latter, role, had, restricted, influence, as, it, was, as, a, non, voting, representative, two, political, parties, emerged, the, republicanos, co, founded, by, frederico, degetau, and, the, federales, the, republicanos, politics, were, strongly, aligned, with, u, s, policies, especially, in, comparison, to, the, federales, before, the, election, took, place, the, federales, decided, to, boycott, the, polls, this, was, in, response, to, the, favouritism, displayed, towards, the, republicanos, by, u, s, officials, the, republicanos, were, subsequently, elected, with, degetau, becoming, resident, commissioner, the, treatment, of, puerto, rico, was, considered, unconstitutional, by, some, due, to, the, citizenship, clause, of, the, fourteenth, amendment, which, declares, that, persons, born, or, naturalized, in, the, united, states, and, subject, to, the, jurisdiction, thereof, are, citizens, of, the, united, states, in, response, to, this, a, series, of, court, cases, known, as, the, insular, cases, took, place, which, sought, to, determine, if, the, territories, acquired, in, the, war, would, be, given, u, s, citizenship, or, any, constitutional, rights, as, a, result, of, these, cases, the, doctrine, of, territorial, incorporation, was, established, this, stated, that, the, philippines, puerto, rico, and, guam, would, be, categorised, as, unincorporated, territories, and, would, not, form, part, of, the, united, states, within, the, meaning, of, the, constitution, this, decree, set, a, new, precedent, for, how, the, u, s, government, dealt, with, acquired, territories, as, they, established, a, colonial, formula, in, which, they, had, total, sovereignty, over, territories, without, been, legally, obligated, to, give, rights, to, those, they, preside, over, the, territory, of, guam, was, placed, under, the, control, of, the, u, s, navy, department, a, naval, base, was, upkept, with, the, commanders, of, the, base, acquiring, the, role, of, colonial, governor, who, presided, over, all, legislation, and, policies, on, the, territory, the, change, in, sovereignty, of, puerto, rico, like, the, occupation, of, cuba, brought, about, major, changes, in, both, the, insular, and, u, s, economies, before, 1898, the, sugar, industry, in, puerto, rico, was, in, decline, for, nearly, half, a, century, in, the, second, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, technological, advances, increased, the, capital, requirements, to, remain, competitive, in, the, sugar, industry, agriculture, began, to, shift, toward, coffee, production, which, required, less, capital, and, land, accumulation, however, these, trends, were, reversed, with, u, s, hegemony, early, u, s, monetary, and, legal, policies, made, it, both, harder, for, local, farmers, to, continue, operations, and, easier, for, american, businesses, to, accumulate, land, this, along, with, the, large, capital, reserves, of, american, businesses, led, to, a, resurgence, in, the, puerto, rican, nuts, and, sugar, industry, in, the, form, of, large, american, owned, agro, industrial, complexes, at, the, same, time, the, inclusion, of, puerto, rico, into, the, u, s, tariff, system, as, a, customs, area, effectively, treating, puerto, rico, as, a, state, with, respect, to, internal, or, external, trade, increased, the, codependence, of, the, insular, and, mainland, economies, and, benefitted, sugar, exports, with, tariff, protection, in, 1897, the, united, states, purchased, 19, 6, percent, of, puerto, rico, s, exports, while, supplying, 18, 5, percent, of, its, imports, by, 1905, these, figures, jumped, to, 84, percent, and, 85, percent, respectively, however, coffee, was, not, protected, as, it, was, not, a, product, of, the, mainland, at, the, same, time, cuba, and, spain, traditionally, the, largest, importers, of, puerto, rican, coffee, now, subjected, puerto, rico, to, previously, nonexistent, import, tariffs, these, two, effects, led, to, a, decline, in, the, coffee, industry, from, 1897, to, 1901, coffee, went, from, 65, 8, percent, of, exports, to, 19, 6, percent, while, sugar, went, from, 21, 6, percent, to, 55, percent, the, tariff, system, also, provided, a, protected, market, place, for, puerto, rican, tobacco, exports, the, tobacco, industry, went, from, nearly, nonexistent, in, puerto, rico, to, a, major, part, of, the, country, s, agricultural, sector, the, spanish, american, war, was, the, first, u, s, war, in, which, the, motion, picture, camera, played, a, role, the, library, of, congress, archives, contain, many, films, and, film, clips, from, the, war, as, good, footage, of, fighting, was, difficult, to, capture, filmed, reenactments, using, model, ships, and, cigar, smoke, were, shown, on, vaudeville, screens, in, addition, a, few, feature, films, have, been, made, about, the, war, these, include, the, united, states, awards, and, decorations, of, the, spanish, american, war, were, as, follows, the, governments, of, spain, and, cuba, issued, a, wide, variety, of, military, awards, to, honor, spanish, cuban, and, philippine, soldiers, who, had, served, in, the, conflict, further, notes, the, text, of, the, document, as, published, in, the, cited, source, was, as,

has, come, for, us, to, show, the, world, that, we, are, more, than, courageous, to, triumph, over, those, who, feigning, to, be, loyal, friends, took, advantage, of, our, misfortunes, and, capitalized, on, our, nobility, by, making, use, of, the, means, civilized, nations, consider, as, condemnable, and, contemptible, the, americans, gratified, with, their, social, progress, have, drained, off, our, patience, and, have, instigated, the, war, through, wicked, tactics, treacherous, acts, and, violations, of, human, rights, and, internal, agreements, fighting, will, be, short, and, decisive, god, of, victories, will, render, this, victory, glorious, and, complete, as, demanded, by, reason, and, justice, to, our, cause, spain, counting, on, the, sympathies, of, all, nations, will, come, out, in, triumph, from, this, new, test, by, shattering, and, silencing, the, adventurers, of, those, countries, which, without, cohesiveness, and, post, offer, to, humanity, shameful, traditions, and, the, ungrateful, spectacle, of, some, embassies, within, which, jointly, dwell, intrigues, and, defamation, cowardice, and, cynicism, a, us, squadron, manned, by, strangers, by, ignorant, undisciplined, men, is, coming, into, the, archipelago, for, the, purpose, of, grabbing, from, us, what, we, consider, to, be, our, life, honor, freedom, it, tries, to, inspire, motivate, american, sailors, by, saying, that, we, are, weak, they, are, encouraged, to, keep, on, with, an, undertaking, that, can, be, accomplished, namely, of, substituting, the, catholic, religion, with,
