the, unification, of, germany, german, deutsche, einigung, pronounced, was, a, process, of, building, the, first, nation, state, for, germans, with, federal, features, based, on, the, concept, of, lesser, germany, one, without, habsburgs, multi, ethnic, austria, or, its, german, speaking, part, it, commenced, on, 18, august, 1866, with, adoption, of, the, north, german, confederation, treaty, establishing, the, north, german, confederation, initially, a, military, alliance, de, facto, dominated, by, prussia, which, was, subsequently, deepened, through, adoption, of, the, north, german, constitution, the, process, symbolically, concluded, when, most, of, south, german, states, joined, the, north, german, confederation, with, the, ceremonial, proclamation, of, the, german, empire, i, e, the, german, reich, having, 25, member, states, and, led, by, the, kingdom, of, prussia, of, hohenzollerns, on, 18, january, 1871, the, event, was, later, celebrated, as, the, customary, date, of, the, german, empire, s, foundation, although, the, legally, meaningful, events, relevant, to, the, accomplishment, of, unification, occurred, on, 1, january, 1871, accession, of, south, german, states, and, constitutional, adoption, of, the, name, german, empire, and, 4, may, 1871, entry, into, force, of, the, permanent, constitution, of, the, german, empire, despite, the, legal, administrative, and, political, disruption, caused, by, the, dissolution, of, the, holy, roman, empire, in, 1806, the, german, speaking, people, of, the, old, empire, had, a, common, linguistic, cultural, and, legal, tradition, european, liberalism, offered, an, intellectual, basis, for, unification, by, challenging, dynastic, and, absolutist, models, of, social, and, political, organization, its, german, manifestation, emphasized, the, importance, of, tradition, education, and, linguistic, unity, economically, the, creation, of, the, prussian, zollverein, customs, union, in, 1818, and, its, subsequent, expansion, to, include, other, states, of, the, austria, under, austrian, empire, led, german, confederation, reduced, competition, between, and, within, states, emerging, modes, of, transportation, facilitated, business, and, recreational, travel, leading, to, contact, and, sometimes, conflict, between, and, among, german, speakers, from, throughout, central, europe, the, model, of, diplomatic, spheres, of, influence, resulting, from, the, congress, of, vienna, in, 1814, 1815, after, the, napoleonic, wars, endorsed, austrian, dominance, in, central, europe, through, habsburg, leadership, of, the, german, confederation, designed, to, replace, the, holy, roman, empire, the, negotiators, at, vienna, took, no, account, of, prussia, s, growing, strength, within, and, declined, to, create, a, second, coalition, of, the, german, states, under, prussia, s, influence, and, so, failed, to, foresee, that, prussia, kingdom, of, prussia, would, rise, to, challenge, austria, for, leadership, of, the, german, peoples, this, german, dualism, presented, two, solutions, to, the, problem, of, unification, kleindeutsche, l, sung, the, small, germany, solution, germany, without, austria, or, gro, deutsche, l, sung, the, greater, germany, solution, germany, with, austria, or, its, german, speaking, part, ultimately, settled, in, favor, of, the, former, solution, in, the, peace, of, prague, historians, debate, whether, otto, von, bismarck, minister, president, of, prussia, had, a, master, plan, to, expand, the, north, german, confederation, of, 1866, to, include, the, remaining, independent, german, states, into, a, single, entity, or, simply, to, expand, the, power, of, the, kingdom, of, prussia, they, conclude, that, factors, in, addition, to, the, strength, of, bismarck, s, realpolitik, led, a, collection, of, early, modern, polities, to, reorganize, their, political, economic, military, and, diplomatic, relationships, in, the, 19th, century, reaction, to, danish, and, french, nationalism, provided, for, expressions, of, german, unity, military, successes, especially, those, of, prussia, in, three, regional, wars, generated, enthusiasm, and, pride, that, politicians, could, harness, to, promote, unification, this, experience, echoed, the, memory, of, mutual, accomplishment, in, the, napoleonic, wars, particularly, in, the, war, of, liberation, of, 1813, 1814, by, establishing, a, germany, without, multi, ethnic, austria, under, austria, hungary, or, its, german, speaking, part, the, political, and, administrative, unification, in, 1871, at, least, temporarily, solved, the, problem, of, dualism, despite, undergoing, in, the, later, years, several, further, changes, of, its, name, and, borders, overhauls, of, its, constitutional, system, periods, of, limited, sovereignty, and, interrupted, unity, of, its, territory, or, government, and, despite, dissolution, of, its, dominant, founding, federated, state, the, polity, resulting, from, the, unification, process, continues, its, existence, surviving, until, today, in, its, contemporary, form, known, as, the, federal, republic, of, germany, germans, emerged, in, medieval, times, among, the, descendants, of, the, romanized, germanic, peoples, in, the, area, of, modern, western, germany, between, the, rhine, and, elbe, rivers, particularly, the, franks, frisians, saxons, thuringii, alemanni, and, baiuvarii, the, region, was, divided, into, long, lasting, divisions, or, stem, duchies, based, upon, these, ethnic, designations, under, the, dominance, of, the, western, franks, starting, with, clovis, i, who, established, control, of, the, romanized, and, frankish, population, of, gaul, in, the, 5th, century, and, began, a, new, process, of, conquering, the, peoples, east, of, the, rhine, in, subsequent, centuries, the, power, of, the, franks, grew, considerably, by, the, early, 9th, century, ad, large, parts, of, europe, had, been, united, under, the, rule, of, the, frankish, leader, charlemagne, who, expanded, the, frankish, empire, francia, in, several, directions, including, east, of, the, rhine, where, he, conquered, saxons, and, frisians, a, confederated, realm, of, german, princedoms, along, with, some, adjacent, lands, had, been, in, existence, for, over, a, thousand, years, dating, to, the, treaty, of, verdun, i, e, the, establishment, of, east, francia, from, eastern, frankish, empire, in, east, of, the, rhine, in, 843, especially, when, the, ottonian, dynasty, took, power, to, rule, east, francia, in, 919, the, realm, later, in, 962, made, up, the, core, of, the, holy, roman, empire, which, at, times, included, more, than, 1, 000, entities, and, was, called, the, holy, roman, empire, of, the, german, nation, from, 1512, with, the, diet, of, cologne, new, title, was, adopted, partly, because, the, empire, lost, most, of, its, territories, in, italy, and, burgundy, to, the, south, and, west, by, the, late, 15th, century, but, also, to, emphasize, the, new, importance, of, the, german, imperial, estates, in, ruling, the, empire, due, to, the, imperial, reform, the, states, of, the, holy, roman, empire, ranged, in, size, from, the, small, and, complex, territories, of, the, princely, hohenlohe, family, branches, to, sizable, well, defined, territories, such, as, the, electorate, of, bavaria, the, margraviate, of, brandenburg, or, the, kingdom, of, bohemia, their, governance, varied, they, included, free, imperial, cities, also, of, different, sizes, such, as, the, powerful, augsburg, and, the, minuscule, weil, der, stadt, ecclesiastical, territories, also, of, varying, sizes, and, influence, such, as, the, wealthy, abbey, of, reichenau, and, the, powerful, archbishopric, of, cologne, and, dynastic, states, such, as, w, rttemberg, among, the, german, speaking, states, the, holy, roman, empire, s, administrative, and, legal, mechanisms, provided, a, venue, to, resolve, disputes, between, peasants, and, landlords, between, jurisdictions, and, within, jurisdictions, through, the, organization, of, imperial, circles, reichskreise, groups, of, states, consolidated, resources, and, promoted, regional, and, organizational, interests, including, economic, cooperation, and, military, protection, since, the, 15th, century, with, few, exceptions, the, empire, s, prince, electors, had, chosen, successive, heads, of, the, house, of, habsburg, from, the, duchy, of, austria, to, hold, the, title, of, holy, roman, emperor, although, they, initially, sought, to, restore, central, imperial, power, preserving, a, weak, and, fragmented, empire, was, convenient, for, france, and, sweden, and, therefore, their, ensuing, intervention, led, to, the, peace, of, westphalia, which, effectively, thwarted, for, centuries, any, serious, attempts, to, reinforce, the, imperial, central, authority, and, petrified, fragmentation, resulting, in, the, german, speaking, territories, comprising, on, the, eve, of, the, napoleonic, wars, still, more, than, 300, political, entities, most, of, them, being, parts, of, the, holy, roman, empire, though, portions, of, the, extensive, habsburg, monarchy, exclusively, its, large, non, german, speaking, territories, lands, of, the, crown, of, saint, stephen, and, the, austrian, partition, of, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, or, of, the, hohenzollern, kingdom, of, prussia, both, the, german, speaking, former, duchy, of, prussia, and, the, non, german, speaking, entire, territory, of, the, prussian, partition, of, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, as, well, as, the, german, speaking, swiss, cantons, were, outside, of, the, imperial, borders, this, became, known, as, the, practice, of, kleinstaaterei, small, statery, as, a, further, consequence, there, was, no, german, national, identity, in, development, as, late, as, 1800, mainly, due, to, the, highly, autonomous, or, semi, independent, nature, of, the, princely, states, most, inhabitants, of, the, holy, roman, empire, outside, of, those, ruled, by, the, emperor, directly, identified, themselves, mainly, with, their, prince, rather, than, with, the, empire, or, the, nation, as, a, whole, however, by, the, 19th, century, transportation, and, communications, improvements, started, to, bring, these, regions, closer, together, invasion, of, the, holy, roman, empire, by, the, first, french, empire, in, the, war, of, the, second, coalition, 1798, 1802, resulted, in, crushing, the, empire, and, allied, forces, by, napoleon, bonaparte, the, treaties, of, lun, ville, 1801, and, the, mediatization, of, 1803, secularized, the, ecclesiastical, principalities, and, abolished, most, free, imperial, cities, and, these, territories, along, with, their, inhabitants, were, absorbed, by, dynastic, states, this, transfer, particularly, enhanced, the, territories, of, w, rttemberg, and, baden, in, 1806, after, a, successful, invasion, of, prussia, and, the, defeat, of, prussia, at, the, joint, battles, of, jena, auerstedt, 1806, during, the, war, of, the, third, coalition, napoleon, dictated, the, treaty, of, pressburg, which, included, the, formal, dissolution, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, the, abdication, of, emperor, francis, ii, from, the, nominal, reign, over, it, napoleon, established, instead, a, german, client, state, of, france, known, as, the, confederation, of, the, rhine, which, inter, alia, provided, for, the, mediatization, of, over, a, hundred, petty, princes, and, counts, and, the, absorption, of, their, territories, as, well, as, those, of, hundreds, of, imperial, knights, by, the, confederation, s, member, states, several, states, were, promoted, to, kingdoms, such, as, the, kingdom, of, bavaria, the, kingdom, of, saxony, or, the, kingdom, of, hanover, following, the, formal, secession, from, the, empire, of, the, majority, of, its, constituent, states, the, emperor, dissolved, the, holy, roman, empire, in, his, abdication, francis, released, all, former, estates, from, their, duties, and, obligations, to, him, and, took, upon, himself, solely, the, title, of, emperor, of, austria, which, had, been, established, since, 1804, under, the, hegemony, of, the, first, french, empire, 1804, 1814, popular, german, nationalism, thrived, in, the, reorganized, german, states, due, in, part, to, the, shared, experience, albeit, under, french, dominance, various, justifications, emerged, to, identify, germany, as, a, potential, future, single, state, for, the, german, philosopher, johann, gottlieb, fichte, the, first, original, and, truly, natural, boundaries, of, states, are, beyond, doubt, their, internal, boundaries, those, who, speak, the, same, language, are, joined, to, each, other, by, a, multitude, of, invisible, bonds, by, nature, herself, long, before, any, human, art, begins, they, understand, each, other, and, have, the, power, of, continuing, to, make, themselves, understood, more, and, more, clearly, they, belong, together, and, are, by, nature, one, and, an, inseparable, whole, a, common, language, may, have, been, seen, to, serve, as, the, basis, of, a, nation, but, as, contemporary, historians, of, 19th, century, germany, noted, it, took, more, than, linguistic, similarity, to, unify, these, several, hundred, polities, the, experience, of, german, speaking, central, europe, during, the, years, of, french, hegemony, contributed, to, a, sense, of, common, cause, to, remove, the, french, invaders, and, reassert, control, over, their, own, lands, the, napoleon, s, campaigns, in, poland, 1806, 07, resulting, in, his, decision, to, re, establish, a, form, of, polish, statehood, the, duchy, of, warsaw, at, the, cost, of, also, prussian, conquered, polish, territories, as, well, as, his, campaigns, on, iberian, peninsula, in, western, germany, and, his, disastrous, invasion, of, russia, in, 1812, disillusioned, many, germans, princes, and, peasants, alike, napoleon, s, continental, system, nearly, ruined, the, central, european, economy, the, invasion, of, russia, included, nearly, 125, 000, troops, from, german, lands, and, the, loss, of, that, army, encouraged, many, germans, both, high, and, low, born, to, envision, a, central, europe, free, of, napoleon, s, influence, the, creation, of, student, militias, such, as, the, l, tzow, free, corps, exemplified, this, tendency, the, debacle, in, russia, loosened, the, french, grip, on, the, german, princes, in, 1813, napoleon, mounted, a, campaign, in, the, german, states, to, bring, them, back, into, the, french, orbit, the, subsequent, war, of, liberation, culminated, in, the, great, battle, of, leipzig, also, known, as, the, battle, of, nations, in, october, 1813, more, than, 500, 000, combatants, engaged, in, ferocious, fighting, over, three, days, making, it, the, largest, european, land, battle, of, the, 19th, century, the, engagement, resulted, in, a, decisive, victory, for, the, coalition, of, austria, prussia, russia, saxony, and, sweden, as, a, result, the, confederation, of, the, rhine, collapsed, and, the, french, period, came, to, an, end, success, encouraged, the, coalition, forces, to, pursue, napoleon, across, the, rhine, his, army, and, his, government, collapsed, and, the, victorious, coalition, incarcerated, napoleon, on, elba, during, the, brief, napoleonic, restoration, known, as, the, 100, days, of, 1815, forces, of, the, seventh, coalition, including, an, anglo, allied, army, under, the, command, of, the, duke, of, wellington, and, a, prussian, army, under, the, command, of, gebhard, von, bl, cher, were, victorious, at, waterloo, 18, june, 1815, the, critical, role, played, by, bl, cher, s, troops, especially, after, having, to, retreat, from, the, field, at, ligny, the, day, before, helped, to, turn, the, tide, of, combat, against, the, french, the, prussian, cavalry, pursued, the, defeated, french, in, the, evening, of, 18, june, sealing, the, allied, victory, from, the, german, perspective, the, actions, of, bl, cher, s, troops, at, waterloo, and, the, combined, efforts, at, leipzig, offered, a, rallying, point, of, pride, and, enthusiasm, this, interpretation, became, a, key, building, block, of, the, borussian, myth, expounded, by, the, pro, prussian, nationalist, historians, later, in, the, 19th, century, after, napoleon, s, defeat, the, congress, of, vienna, established, a, new, european, political, diplomatic, system, based, on, the, balance, of, power, this, system, reorganized, europe, into, spheres, of, influence, which, in, some, cases, suppressed, the, aspirations, of, the, various, nationalities, including, the, germans, and, italians, generally, an, enlarged, prussia, and, the, 38, other, states, consolidated, from, the, mediatized, territories, of, 1803, were, confederated, within, the, austrian, empire, s, sphere, of, influence, the, congress, established, a, loose, german, confederation, 1815, 1866, headed, by, austria, with, a, federal, diet, called, the, bundestag, or, bundesversammlung, an, assembly, of, appointed, leaders, that, met, in, the, city, of, frankfurt, am, main, its, borders, resembled, those, of, its, predecessor, the, holy, roman, empire, though, there, were, some, deviations, e, g, prussian, territory, in, the, confederation, was, extended, to, include, also, the, formerly, polish, territories, of, the, lauenburg, and, b, tow, land, and, the, former, starostwo, of, draheim, while, austrian, part, was, extended, to, include, in, the, years, 1818, 1850, also, the, formerly, polish, territories, of, the, duchy, of, o, wi, cim, and, the, duchy, of, zator, meaning, that, large, portions, of, both, prussia, and, austria, were, left, outside, in, recognition, of, the, imperial, position, traditionally, held, by, the, habsburgs, the, emperors, of, austria, became, the, titular, presidents, of, this, parliament, despite, the, nomenclature, of, diet, assembly, or, parliament, this, institution, should, in, no, way, be, construed, as, a, broadly, or, popularly, elected, group, of, representatives, many, of, the, states, did, not, have, constitutions, and, those, that, did, such, as, the, duchy, of, baden, based, suffrage, on, strict, property, requirements, which, effectively, limited, suffrage, to, a, small, portion, of, the, male, population, problematically, the, built, in, austrian, dominance, failed, to, take, into, account, prussia, s, 18th, century, emergence, in, imperial, politics, this, impractical, solution, did, not, reflect, the, new, status, of, prussia, in, the, overall, scheme, although, the, prussian, army, had, been, dramatically, defeated, in, the, 1806, battle, of, jena, auerstedt, it, had, made, a, spectacular, comeback, at, waterloo, consequently, prussian, leaders, expected, to, play, a, pivotal, role, in, german, politics, ever, since, the, prince, elector, of, brandenburg, had, made, himself, king, in, prussia, at, the, beginning, of, that, century, their, domains, had, steadily, increased, through, inheritance, and, war, prussia, s, consolidated, strength, had, become, especially, apparent, during, the, partitions, of, poland, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, and, the, seven, years, war, under, frederick, the, great, as, maria, theresa, and, joseph, tried, to, restore, habsburg, hegemony, in, the, holy, roman, empire, frederick, countered, with, the, creation, of, the, f, rstenbund, union, of, princes, in, 1785, austrian, prussian, dualism, lay, firmly, rooted, in, old, imperial, politics, those, balance, of, power, manoeuvers, were, epitomized, by, the, war, of, the, bavarian, succession, or, potato, war, among, common, folk, even, after, the, end, of, the, holy, roman, empire, this, competition, influenced, the, growth, and, development, of, nationalist, movements, in, the, 19th, century, the, period, of, austrian, and, prussian, police, states, and, vast, censorship, between, the, congress, of, vienna, and, the, revolutions, of, 1848, in, germany, later, became, widely, known, as, the, vorm, rz, before, march, referring, to, march, 1848, during, this, period, european, liberalism, gained, momentum, the, agenda, included, economic, social, and, political, issues, most, european, liberals, in, the, vorm, rz, sought, unification, under, nationalist, principles, promoted, the, transition, to, capitalism, sought, the, expansion, of, male, suffrage, among, other, issues, their, radicalness, depended, upon, where, they, stood, on, the, spectrum, of, male, suffrage, the, wider, the, definition, of, suffrage, the, more, radical, the, surge, of, german, nationalism, stimulated, by, the, experience, of, germans, in, the, napoleonic, period, and, initially, allied, with, liberalism, shifted, political, social, and, cultural, relationships, within, the, german, states, in, this, context, one, can, detect, its, roots, in, the, experience, of, germans, in, the, napoleonic, period, furthermore, implicit, and, sometimes, explicit, promises, made, during, the, german, campaign, of, 1813, engendered, an, expectation, of, popular, sovereignty, and, widespread, participation, in, the, political, process, promises, that, largely, went, unfulfilled, once, peace, had, been, achieved, despite, considerable, conservative, reaction, ideas, of, unity, joined, with, notions, of, popular, sovereignty, in, german, speaking, lands, the, burschenschaft, student, organizations, and, popular, demonstrations, such, as, those, held, at, wartburg, castle, in, october, 1817, contributed, to, a, growing, sense, of, unity, among, german, speakers, of, central, europe, at, the, wartburg, festival, in, 1817, the, first, real, movements, among, the, students, were, formed, fraternities, and, student, organizations, emerged, the, colors, black, red, and, gold, were, symbolic, of, this, agitation, by, student, organizations, led, such, conservative, leaders, as, klemens, wenzel, prince, von, metternich, to, fear, the, rise, of, national, sentiment, the, assassination, of, german, dramatist, august, von, kotzebue, in, march, 1819, by, a, radical, student, seeking, unification, was, followed, on, 20, september, 1819, by, the, proclamation, of, the, carlsbad, decrees, which, hampered, intellectual, leadership, of, the, nationalist, movement, metternich, was, able, to, harness, conservative, outrage, at, the, assassination, to, consolidate, legislation, that, would, further, limit, the, press, and, constrain, the, rising, liberal, and, nationalist, movements, consequently, these, decrees, drove, the, burschenschaften, underground, restricted, the, publication, of, nationalist, materials, expanded, censorship, of, the, press, and, private, correspondence, and, limited, academic, speech, by, prohibiting, university, professors, from, encouraging, nationalist, discussion, the, decrees, were, the, subject, of, johann, joseph, von, g, rres, s, pamphlet, teutschland, und, die, revolution, germany, and, the, revolution, 1820, in, which, he, concluded, that, it, was, both, impossible, and, undesirable, to, repress, the, free, utterance, of, public, opinion, by, reactionary, measures, the, hambach, festival, hambacher, fest, in, may, 1832, was, attended, by, a, crowd, of, more, than, 30, 000, promoted, as, a, county, fair, its, participants, celebrated, fraternity, liberty, and, national, unity, celebrants, gathered, in, the, town, below, and, marched, to, the, ruins, of, hambach, castle, on, the, heights, above, the, small, town, of, hambach, in, the, palatinate, province, of, bavaria, carrying, flags, beating, drums, and, singing, the, participants, took, the, better, part, of, the, morning, and, mid, day, to, arrive, at, the, castle, grounds, where, they, listened, to, speeches, by, nationalist, orators, from, across, the, conservative, to, radical, political, spectrum, the, overall, content, of, the, speeches, suggested, a, fundamental, difference, between, the, german, nationalism, of, the, 1830s, and, the, french, nationalism, of, the, july, revolution, the, focus, of, german, nationalism, lay, in, the, education, of, the, people, once, the, populace, was, educated, as, to, what, was, needed, they, would, accomplish, it, the, hambach, rhetoric, emphasized, the, overall, peaceable, nature, of, german, nationalism, the, point, was, not, to, build, barricades, a, very, french, form, of, nationalism, but, to, build, emotional, bridges, between, groups, as, he, had, done, in, 1819, after, the, kotzebue, assassination, metternich, used, the, popular, demonstration, at, hambach, to, push, conservative, social, policy, the, six, articles, of, 28, june, 1832, primarily, reaffirmed, the, principle, of, monarchical, authority, on, 5, july, the, frankfurt, diet, voted, for, an, additional, 10, articles, which, reiterated, existing, rules, on, censorship, restricted, political, organizations, and, limited, other, public, activity, furthermore, the, member, states, agreed, to, send, military, assistance, to, any, government, threatened, by, unrest, prince, wrede, led, half, of, the, bavarian, army, to, the, palatinate, to, subdue, the, province, several, hapless, hambach, speakers, were, arrested, tried, and, imprisoned, one, karl, heinrich, br, ggemann, 1810, 1887, a, law, student, and, representative, of, the, secretive, burschenschaft, was, sent, to, prussia, where, he, was, first, condemned, to, death, but, later, pardoned, crucially, both, the, wartburg, rally, in, 1817, and, the, hambach, festival, in, 1832, had, lacked, any, clear, cut, program, of, unification, at, hambach, the, positions, of, the, many, speakers, illustrated, their, disparate, agendas, held, together, only, by, the, idea, of, unification, their, notions, of, how, to, achieve, this, did, not, include, specific, plans, but, instead, rested, on, the, nebulous, idea, that, the, volk, the, people, if, properly, educated, would, bring, about, unification, on, their, own, grand, speeches, flags, exuberant, students, and, picnic, lunches, did, not, translate, into, a, new, political, bureaucratic, or, administrative, apparatus, while, many, spoke, about, the, need, for, a, constitution, no, such, document, appeared, from, the, discussions, in, 1848, nationalists, sought, to, remedy, that, problem, several, other, factors, complicated, the, rise, of, nationalism, in, the, german, states, the, man, made, factors, included, political, rivalries, between, members, of, the, german, confederation, particularly, between, the, austrians, and, the, prussians, and, socio, economic, competition, among, the, commercial, and, merchant, interests, and, the, old, land, owning, and, aristocratic, interests, natural, factors, included, widespread, drought, in, the, early, 1830s, and, again, in, the, 1840s, and, a, food, crisis, in, the, 1840s, further, complications, emerged, as, a, result, of, a, shift, in, industrialization, and, manufacturing, as, people, sought, jobs, they, left, their, villages, and, small, towns, to, work, during, the, week, in, the, cities, returning, for, a, day, and, a, half, on, weekends, the, economic, social, and, cultural, dislocation, of, ordinary, people, the, economic, hardship, of, an, economy, in, transition, and, the, pressures, of, meteorological, disasters, all, contributed, to, growing, problems, in, central, europe, the, failure, of, most, of, the, governments, to, deal, with, the, food, crisis, of, the, mid, 1840s, caused, by, the, potato, blight, related, to, the, great, irish, famine, and, several, seasons, of, bad, weather, encouraged, many, to, think, that, the, rich, and, powerful, had, no, interest, in, their, problems, those, in, authority, were, concerned, about, the, growing, unrest, political, and, social, agitation, among, the, working, classes, and, the, disaffection, of, the, intelligentsia, no, amount, of, censorship, fines, imprisonment, or, banishment, it, seemed, could, stem, the, criticism, furthermore, it, was, becoming, increasingly, clear, that, both, austria, and, prussia, wanted, to, be, the, leaders, in, any, resulting, unification, each, would, inhibit, the, drive, of, the, other, to, achieve, unification, formation, of, the, zollverein, an, institution, key, to, unifying, the, german, states, economically, helped, to, create, a, larger, sense, of, economic, unification, initially, conceived, by, the, prussian, finance, minister, hans, count, von, b, low, as, a, prussian, customs, union, in, 1818, the, zollverein, linked, the, many, prussian, and, hohenzollern, territories, over, the, ensuing, thirty, years, and, more, other, german, states, joined, the, union, helped, to, reduce, protectionist, barriers, between, the, german, states, especially, improving, the, transport, of, raw, materials, and, finished, goods, making, it, both, easier, to, move, goods, across, territorial, borders, and, less, costly, to, buy, transport, and, sell, raw, materials, this, was, particularly, important, for, the, emerging, industrial, centers, most, of, which, were, located, in, the, prussian, regions, of, the, rhineland, the, saar, and, the, ruhr, valleys, states, more, distant, from, the, coast, joined, the, customs, union, earlier, not, being, a, member, mattered, more, for, the, states, of, south, germany, since, the, external, tariff, of, the, customs, union, prevented, customs, free, access, to, the, coast, which, gave, access, to, international, markets, thus, by, 1836, all, states, to, the, south, of, prussia, had, joined, the, customs, union, except, austria, in, contrast, the, coastal, states, already, had, barrier, free, access, to, international, trade, and, did, not, want, consumers, and, producers, burdened, with, the, import, duties, they, would, pay, if, they, were, within, the, zollverein, customs, border, hanover, on, the, north, coast, formed, its, own, customs, union, the, tax, union, or, steuerverein, in, 1834, with, brunswick, and, with, oldenburg, in, 1836, the, external, tariffs, on, finished, goods, and, overseas, raw, materials, were, below, the, rates, of, the, zollverein, brunswick, joined, the, zollverein, customs, union, in, 1842, while, hanover, and, oldenburg, finally, joined, in, 1854, after, the, austro, prussian, war, of, 1866, schleswig, holstein, and, lauenburg, were, annexed, by, prussia, and, thus, annexed, also, to, the, customs, union, while, the, two, mecklenburg, states, and, the, city, states, of, hamburg, and, bremen, joined, late, because, they, were, reliant, on, international, trade, the, mecklenburgs, joined, in, 1867, while, bremen, and, hamburg, joined, in, 1888, by, the, early, 19th, century, german, roads, had, deteriorated, to, an, appalling, extent, travelers, both, foreign, and, local, complained, bitterly, about, the, state, of, the, heerstra, en, the, military, roads, previously, maintained, for, the, ease, of, moving, troops, as, german, states, ceased, to, be, a, military, crossroads, however, the, roads, improved, the, length, of, hard, surfaced, roads, in, prussia, increased, from, 3, 800, kilometers, 2, 400, mi, in, 1816, to, 16, 600, kilometers, 10, 300, mi, in, 1852, helped, in, part, by, the, invention, of, macadam, by, 1835, heinrich, von, gagern, wrote, that, roads, were, the, veins, and, arteries, of, the, body, politic, and, predicted, that, they, would, promote, freedom, independence, and, prosperity, as, people, moved, around, they, came, into, contact, with, others, on, trains, at, hotels, in, restaurants, and, for, some, at, fashionable, resorts, such, as, the, spa, in, baden, baden, water, transportation, also, improved, the, blockades, on, the, rhine, had, been, removed, by, napoleon, s, orders, but, by, the, 1820s, steam, engines, freed, riverboats, from, the, cumbersome, system, of, men, and, animals, that, towed, them, upstream, by, 1846, 180, steamers, plied, german, rivers, and, lake, constance, and, a, network, of, canals, extended, from, the, danube, the, weser, and, the, elbe, rivers, as, important, as, these, improvements, were, they, could, not, compete, with, the, impact, of, the, railway, german, economist, friedrich, list, called, the, railways, and, the, customs, union, siamese, twins, emphasizing, their, important, relationship, to, one, another, he, was, not, alone, the, poet, august, heinrich, hoffmann, von, fallersleben, wrote, a, poem, in, which, he, extolled, the, virtues, of, the, zollverein, which, he, began, with, a, list, of, commodities, that, had, contributed, more, to, german, unity, than, politics, or, diplomacy, historians, of, the, german, empire, later, regarded, the, railways, as, the, first, indicator, of, a, unified, state, the, patriotic, novelist, wilhelm, raabe, wrote, the, german, empire, was, founded, with, the, construction, of, the, first, railway, not, everyone, greeted, the, iron, monster, with, enthusiasm, the, prussian, king, frederick, william, iii, saw, no, advantage, in, traveling, from, berlin, to, potsdam, a, few, hours, faster, and, metternich, refused, to, ride, in, one, at, all, others, wondered, if, the, railways, were, an, evil, that, threatened, the, landscape, nikolaus, lenau, s, 1838, poem, an, den, fr, hling, to, spring, bemoaned, the, way, trains, destroyed, the, pristine, quietude, of, german, forests, the, bavarian, ludwig, railway, which, was, the, first, passenger, or, freight, rail, line, in, the, german, lands, connected, nuremberg, and, f, rth, in, 1835, although, it, was, 6, kilometers, 3, 7, mi, long, and, only, operated, in, daylight, it, proved, both, profitable, and, popular, within, three, years, 141, kilometers, 88, mi, of, track, had, been, laid, by, 1840, 462, kilometers, 287, mi, and, by, 1860, 11, 157, kilometers, 6, 933, mi, lacking, a, geographically, central, organizing, feature, such, as, a, national, capital, the, rails, were, laid, in, webs, linking, towns, and, markets, within, regions, regions, within, larger, regions, and, so, on, as, the, rail, network, expanded, it, became, cheaper, to, transport, goods, in, 1840, 18, pfennigs, per, ton, per, kilometer, and, in, 1870, five, pfennigs, the, effects, of, the, railway, were, immediate, for, example, raw, materials, could, travel, up, and, down, the, ruhr, valley, without, having, to, unload, and, reload, railway, lines, encouraged, economic, activity, by, creating, demand, for, commodities, and, by, facilitating, commerce, in, 1850, inland, shipping, carried, three, times, more, freight, than, railroads, by, 1870, the, situation, was, reversed, and, railroads, carried, four, times, more, rail, travel, changed, how, cities, looked, and, how, people, traveled, its, impact, reached, throughout, the, social, order, affecting, the, highest, born, to, the, lowest, although, some, of, the, outlying, german, provinces, were, not, serviced, by, rail, until, the, 1890s, the, majority, of, the, population, manufacturing, centers, and, production, centers, were, linked, to, the, rail, network, by, 1865, as, travel, became, easier, faster, and, less, expensive, germans, started, to, see, unity, in, factors, other, than, their, language, the, brothers, grimm, who, compiled, a, massive, dictionary, known, as, the, grimm, also, assembled, a, compendium, of, folk, tales, and, fables, which, highlighted, the, story, telling, parallels, between, different, regions, karl, baedeker, wrote, guidebooks, to, different, cities, and, regions, of, central, europe, indicating, places, to, stay, sites, to, visit, and, giving, a, short, history, of, castles, battlefields, famous, buildings, and, famous, people, his, guides, also, included, distances, roads, to, avoid, and, hiking, paths, to, follow, the, words, of, august, heinrich, hoffmann, von, fallersleben, expressed, not, only, the, linguistic, unity, of, the, german, people, but, also, their, geographic, unity, in, deutschland, deutschland, ber, alles, officially, called, das, lied, der, deutschen, the, song, of, the, germans, fallersleben, called, upon, sovereigns, throughout, the, german, states, to, recognize, the, unifying, characteristics, of, the, german, people, such, other, patriotic, songs, as, die, wacht, am, rhein, the, watch, on, the, rhine, by, max, schneckenburger, began, to, focus, attention, on, geographic, space, not, limiting, germanness, to, a, common, language, schneckenburger, wrote, the, watch, on, the, rhine, in, a, specific, patriotic, response, to, french, assertions, that, the, rhine, was, france, s, natural, eastern, boundary, in, the, refrain, dear, fatherland, dear, fatherland, put, your, mind, to, rest, the, watch, stands, true, on, the, rhine, and, in, such, other, patriotic, poetry, as, nicholaus, becker, s, das, rheinlied, the, rhine, germans, were, called, upon, to, defend, their, territorial, homeland, in, 1807, alexander, von, humboldt, argued, that, national, character, reflected, geographic, influence, linking, landscape, to, people, concurrent, with, this, idea, movements, to, preserve, old, fortresses, and, historic, sites, emerged, and, these, particularly, focused, on, the, rhineland, the, site, of, so, many, confrontations, with, france, and, spain, the, widespread, mainly, german, revolutions, of, 1848, 49, sought, unification, of, germany, under, a, single, constitution, the, revolutionaries, pressured, various, state, governments, particularly, those, in, the, rhineland, for, a, parliamentary, assembly, that, would, have, the, responsibility, to, draft, a, constitution, ultimately, many, of, the, left, wing, revolutionaries, hoped, this, constitution, would, establish, universal, male, suffrage, a, permanent, national, parliament, and, a, unified, germany, possibly, under, the, leadership, of, the, prussian, king, this, seemed, to, be, the, most, logical, course, since, prussia, was, the, strongest, of, the, german, states, as, well, as, the, largest, in, geographic, size, meanwhile, center, right, revolutionaries, sought, some, kind, of, expanded, suffrage, within, their, states, and, potentially, a, form, of, loose, unification, finally, the, polish, majority, living, in, the, share, of, polish, territory, annexed, by, prussia, pursued, their, own, liberation, agenda, their, pressure, resulted, in, a, variety, of, elections, based, on, different, voting, qualifications, such, as, the, prussian, three, class, franchise, which, weighted, votes, based, on, the, amount, of, taxes, paid, and, therefore, gave, some, electoral, groups, chiefly, the, wealthier, landed, ones, greater, representative, power, on, 27, march, 1849, the, frankfurt, parliament, passed, the, paulskirchenverfassung, constitution, of, st, paul, s, church, and, offered, the, title, of, kaiser, emperor, to, the, prussian, king, frederick, william, iv, the, next, month, he, refused, for, a, variety, of, reasons, publicly, he, replied, that, he, could, not, accept, a, crown, without, the, consent, of, the, actual, states, by, which, he, meant, the, princes, privately, he, feared, opposition, from, the, other, german, princes, and, military, intervention, from, austria, or, russia, he, also, held, a, fundamental, distaste, for, the, idea, of, accepting, a, crown, from, a, popularly, elected, parliament, he, would, not, accept, a, crown, of, clay, despite, franchise, requirements, that, often, perpetuated, many, of, the, problems, of, sovereignty, and, political, participation, liberals, sought, to, overcome, the, frankfurt, parliament, did, manage, to, draft, a, constitution, and, reach, an, agreement, on, the, kleindeutsch, solution, while, the, liberals, failed, to, achieve, the, unification, they, sought, they, did, manage, to, gain, a, partial, victory, by, working, with, the, german, princes, on, many, constitutional, issues, and, collaborating, with, them, on, reforms, scholars, of, german, history, have, engaged, in, decades, of, debate, over, how, the, successes, and, failures, of, the, frankfurt, parliament, contribute, to, the, historiographical, explanations, of, german, nation, building, one, school, of, thought, which, emerged, after, the, great, war, and, gained, momentum, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, ii, maintains, that, the, failure, of, german, liberals, in, the, frankfurt, parliament, led, to, bourgeoisie, compromise, with, conservatives, especially, the, conservative, junker, landholders, which, subsequently, led, to, the, so, called, sonderweg, distinctive, path, of, 20th, century, german, history, failure, to, achieve, unification, in, 1848, this, argument, holds, resulted, in, the, late, formation, of, the, nation, state, in, 1871, which, in, turn, delayed, the, development, of, positive, national, values, hitler, often, called, on, the, german, public, to, sacrifice, all, for, the, cause, of, their, great, nation, but, his, regime, did, not, create, german, nationalism, it, merely, capitalized, on, an, intrinsic, cultural, value, of, german, society, that, still, remains, prevalent, even, to, this, day, furthermore, this, argument, maintains, the, failure, of, 1848, reaffirmed, latent, aristocratic, longings, among, the, german, middle, class, consequently, this, group, never, developed, a, self, conscious, program, of, modernization, more, recent, scholarship, has, rejected, this, idea, claiming, that, germany, did, not, have, an, actual, distinctive, path, any, more, than, any, other, nation, a, historiographic, idea, known, as, exceptionalism, instead, modern, historians, claim, 1848, saw, specific, achievements, by, the, liberal, politicians, many, of, their, ideas, and, programs, were, later, incorporated, into, bismarck, s, social, programs, e, g, social, insurance, education, programs, and, wider, definitions, of, suffrage, in, addition, the, notion, of, a, distinctive, path, relies, upon, the, underlying, assumption, that, some, other, nation, s, path, in, this, case, the, united, kingdom, s, is, the, accepted, norm, this, new, argument, further, challenges, the, norms, of, the, british, centric, model, of, development, studies, of, national, development, in, britain, and, other, normal, states, e, g, france, or, the, united, states, have, suggested, that, even, in, these, cases, the, modern, nation, state, did, not, develop, evenly, nor, did, it, develop, particularly, early, being, rather, a, largely, mid, to, late, 19th, century, phenomenon, since, the, end, of, the, 1990s, this, view, has, become, widely, accepted, although, some, historians, still, find, the, sonderweg, analysis, helpful, in, understanding, the, period, of, national, socialism, after, the, frankfurt, parliament, disbanded, frederick, william, iv, under, the, influence, of, general, joseph, maria, von, radowitz, supported, the, establishment, of, the, erfurt, union, a, federation, of, german, states, excluding, austria, by, the, free, agreement, of, the, german, princes, this, limited, union, under, prussia, would, have, almost, eliminated, austrian, influence, on, the, other, german, states, combined, diplomatic, pressure, from, austria, and, russia, a, guarantor, of, the, 1815, agreements, that, established, european, spheres, of, influence, forced, prussia, to, relinquish, the, idea, of, the, erfurt, union, at, a, meeting, in, the, small, town, of, olm, tz, in, moravia, in, november, 1850, the, prussians, specifically, radowitz, and, frederick, william, agreed, to, the, restoration, of, the, german, confederation, under, austrian, leadership, this, became, known, as, the, punctation, of, olm, tz, but, among, prussians, it, was, known, as, the, humiliation, of, olm, tz, although, seemingly, minor, events, the, erfurt, union, proposal, and, the, punctation, of, olm, tz, brought, the, problems, of, influence, in, the, german, states, into, sharp, focus, the, question, became, not, a, matter, of, if, but, rather, when, unification, would, occur, and, when, was, contingent, upon, strength, one, of, the, former, frankfurt, parliament, members, johann, gustav, droysen, summed, up, the, problem, we, cannot, conceal, the, fact, that, the, whole, german, question, is, a, simple, alternative, between, prussia, and, austria, in, these, states, german, life, has, its, positive, and, negative, poles, in, the, former, all, the, interests, are, national, and, reformative, in, the, latter, all, that, are, dynastic, and, destructive, the, german, question, is, not, a, constitutional, question, but, a, question, of, power, and, the, prussian, monarchy, is, now, wholly, german, while, that, of, austria, cannot, be, unification, under, these, conditions, raised, a, basic, diplomatic, problem, the, possibility, of, german, or, italian, unification, would, overturn, the, overlapping, spheres, of, influence, system, created, in, 1815, at, the, congress, of, vienna, the, principal, architects, of, this, convention, metternich, castlereagh, and, tsar, alexander, with, his, foreign, secretary, count, karl, nesselrode, had, conceived, of, and, organized, a, europe, balanced, and, guaranteed, by, four, great, powers, great, britain, france, russia, and, austria, with, each, power, having, a, geographic, sphere, of, influence, france, s, sphere, included, the, iberian, peninsula, and, a, share, of, influence, in, the, italian, states, russia, s, included, the, eastern, regions, of, central, europe, and, a, balancing, influence, in, the, balkans, austria, s, sphere, expanded, throughout, much, of, the, central, european, territories, formerly, held, by, the, holy, roman, empire, britain, s, sphere, was, the, rest, of, the, world, especially, the, seas, this, sphere, of, influence, system, depended, upon, the, fragmentation, of, the, german, and, italian, states, not, their, consolidation, consequently, a, german, nation, united, under, one, banner, presented, significant, questions, there, was, no, readily, applicable, definition, for, who, the, german, people, would, be, or, how, far, the, borders, of, a, german, nation, would, stretch, there, was, also, uncertainty, as, to, who, would, best, lead, and, defend, germany, however, it, was, defined, different, groups, offered, different, solutions, to, this, problem, in, the, kleindeutschland, lesser, germany, solution, the, german, states, would, be, united, under, the, leadership, of, the, prussian, hohenzollerns, in, the, grossdeutschland, greater, germany, solution, the, german, states, would, be, united, under, the, leadership, of, the, austrian, habsburgs, this, controversy, the, latest, phase, of, the, german, dualism, debate, that, had, dominated, the, politics, of, the, german, states, and, austro, prussian, diplomacy, since, the, 1701, creation, of, the, kingdom, of, prussia, would, come, to, a, head, during, the, following, twenty, years, other, nationalists, had, high, hopes, for, the, german, unification, movement, and, the, frustration, with, lasting, german, unification, after, 1850, seemed, to, set, the, national, movement, back, revolutionaries, associated, national, unification, with, progress, as, giuseppe, garibaldi, wrote, to, german, revolutionary, karl, blind, on, 10, april, 1865, the, progress, of, humanity, seems, to, have, come, to, a, halt, and, you, with, your, superior, intelligence, will, know, why, the, reason, is, that, the, world, lacks, a, nation, possesses, true, leadership, such, leadership, of, course, is, required, not, to, dominate, other, peoples, but, to, lead, them, along, the, path, of, duty, to, lead, them, toward, the, brotherhood, of, nations, where, all, the, barriers, erected, by, egoism, will, be, destroyed, garibaldi, looked, to, germany, for, the, kind, of, leadership, in, the, true, tradition, of, medieval, chivalry, would, devote, itself, to, redressing, wrongs, supporting, the, weak, sacrificing, momentary, gains, and, material, advantage, for, the, much, finer, and, more, satisfying, achievement, of, relieving, the, suffering, of, our, fellow, men, we, need, a, nation, courageous, enough, to, give, us, a, lead, in, this, direction, it, would, rally, to, its, cause, all, those, who, are, suffering, wrong, or, who, aspire, to, a, better, life, and, all, those, who, are, now, enduring, foreign, oppression, german, unification, had, also, been, viewed, as, a, prerequisite, for, the, creation, of, a, european, federation, which, giuseppe, mazzini, and, other, european, patriots, had, been, promoting, for, more, than, three, decades, in, the, spring, of, 1834, while, at, berne, mazzini, and, a, dozen, refugees, from, italy, poland, and, germany, founded, a, new, association, with, the, grandiose, name, of, young, europe, its, basic, and, equally, grandiose, idea, was, that, as, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, had, enlarged, the, concept, of, individual, liberty, another, revolution, would, now, be, needed, for, national, liberty, and, his, vision, went, further, because, he, hoped, that, in, the, no, doubt, distant, future, free, nations, might, combine, to, form, a, loosely, federal, europe, with, some, kind, of, federal, assembly, to, regulate, their, common, interests, his, intention, was, nothing, less, than, to, overturn, the, european, settlement, agreed, in, 1815, by, the, congress, of, vienna, which, had, reestablished, an, oppressive, hegemony, of, a, few, great, powers, and, blocked, the, emergence, of, smaller, nations, mazzini, hoped, but, without, much, confidence, that, his, vision, of, a, league, or, society, of, independent, nations, would, be, realized, in, his, own, lifetime, in, practice, young, europe, lacked, the, money, and, popular, support, for, more, than, a, short, term, existence, nevertheless, he, always, remained, faithful, to, the, ideal, of, a, united, continent, for, which, the, creation, of, individual, nations, would, be, an, indispensable, preliminary, king, frederick, william, iv, suffered, a, stroke, in, 1857, and, could, no, longer, rule, this, led, to, his, brother, william, becoming, prince, regent, of, the, kingdom, of, prussia, in, 1858, meanwhile, helmuth, von, moltke, had, become, chief, of, the, prussian, general, staff, in, 1857, and, albrecht, von, roon, would, become, prussian, minister, of, war, in, 1859, this, shuffling, of, authority, within, the, prussian, military, establishment, would, have, important, consequences, von, roon, and, william, who, took, an, active, interest, in, military, structures, began, reorganizing, the, prussian, army, while, moltke, redesigned, the, strategic, defense, of, prussia, by, streamlining, operational, command, prussian, army, reforms, especially, how, to, pay, for, them, caused, a, constitutional, crisis, beginning, in, 1860, because, both, parliament, and, william, via, his, minister, of, war, wanted, control, over, the, military, budget, william, crowned, king, wilhelm, i, in, 1861, appointed, otto, von, bismarck, to, the, position, of, minister, president, of, prussia, in, 1862, bismarck, resolved, the, crisis, in, favor, of, the, war, minister, the, crimean, war, of, 1854, 55, and, the, italian, war, of, 1859, disrupted, relations, among, great, britain, france, austria, and, russia, in, the, aftermath, of, this, disarray, the, convergence, of, von, moltke, s, operational, redesign, von, roon, and, wilhelm, s, army, restructure, and, bismarck, s, diplomacy, influenced, the, realignment, of, the, european, balance, of, power, their, combined, agendas, established, prussia, as, the, leading, german, power, through, a, combination, of, foreign, diplomatic, triumphs, backed, up, by, the, possible, use, of, prussian, military, might, and, an, internal, conservatism, tempered, by, pragmatism, which, came, to, be, known, as, realpolitik, bismarck, expressed, the, essence, of, realpolitik, in, his, subsequently, famous, blood, and, iron, speech, to, the, budget, committee, of, the, prussian, chamber, of, deputies, on, 30, september, 1862, shortly, after, he, became, minister, president, the, great, questions, of, the, time, will, not, be, resolved, by, speeches, and, majority, decisions, that, was, the, great, mistake, of, 1848, and, 1849, but, by, iron, and, blood, bismarck, s, words, iron, and, blood, or, blood, and, iron, as, often, attributed, have, often, been, misappropriated, as, evidence, of, a, german, lust, for, blood, and, power, first, the, phrase, from, his, speech, the, great, questions, of, time, will, not, be, resolved, by, speeches, and, majority, decisions, is, often, interpreted, as, a, repudiation, of, the, political, process, a, repudiation, bismarck, did, not, himself, advocate, second, his, emphasis, on, blood, and, iron, did, not, imply, simply, the, unrivaled, military, might, of, the, prussian, army, but, rather, two, important, aspects, the, ability, of, the, assorted, german, states, to, produce, iron, and, other, related, war, materials, and, the, willingness, to, use, those, war, materials, if, necessary, by, 1862, when, bismarck, made, his, speech, the, idea, of, a, german, nation, state, in, the, peaceful, spirit, of, pan, germanism, had, shifted, from, the, liberal, and, democratic, character, of, 1848, to, accommodate, bismarck, s, more, conservative, realpolitik, bismarck, sought, to, link, a, unified, state, to, the, hohenzollern, dynasty, which, for, some, historians, remains, one, of, bismarck, s, primary, contributions, to, the, creation, of, the, german, empire, in, 1871, while, the, conditions, of, the, treaties, binding, the, various, german, states, to, one, another, prohibited, bismarck, from, taking, unilateral, action, the, politician, and, diplomat, in, him, realized, the, impracticality, of, this, to, get, the, german, states, to, unify, bismarck, needed, a, single, outside, enemy, that, would, declare, war, on, one, of, the, german, states, first, thus, providing, a, casus, belli, to, rally, all, germans, behind, this, opportunity, arose, with, the, outbreak, of, the, franco, prussian, war, in, 1870, historians, have, long, debated, bismarck, s, role, in, the, events, leading, up, to, the, war, the, traditional, view, promulgated, in, large, part, by, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, pro, prussian, historians, maintains, that, bismarck, s, intent, was, always, german, unification, post, 1945, historians, however, see, more, short, term, opportunism, and, cynicism, in, bismarck, s, manipulation, of, the, circumstances, to, create, a, war, rather, than, a, grand, scheme, to, unify, a, nation, state, regardless, of, motivation, by, manipulating, events, of, 1866, and, 1870, bismarck, demonstrated, the, political, and, diplomatic, skill, that, had, caused, wilhelm, to, turn, to, him, in, 1862, three, episodes, proved, fundamental, to, the, unification, of, germany, first, the, death, without, male, heirs, of, frederick, vii, of, denmark, led, to, the, second, war, of, schleswig, in, 1864, second, the, unification, of, italy, provided, prussia, an, ally, against, austria, in, the, austro, prussian, war, of, 1866, finally, france, fearing, hohenzollern, encirclement, declared, war, on, prussia, in, 1870, resulting, in, the, franco, prussian, war, through, a, combination, of, bismarck, s, diplomacy, and, political, leadership, von, roon, s, military, reorganization, and, von, moltke, s, military, strategy, prussia, demonstrated, that, none, of, the, european, signatories, of, the, 1815, peace, treaty, could, guarantee, austria, s, sphere, of, influence, in, central, europe, thus, achieving, prussian, hegemony, in, germany, and, ending, the, dualism, debate, the, first, episode, in, the, saga, of, german, unification, under, bismarck, came, with, the, schleswig, holstein, question, on, 15, november, 1863, christian, ix, became, king, of, denmark, and, duke, of, schleswig, holstein, and, lauenburg, which, the, danish, king, held, in, personal, union, on, 18, november, 1863, he, signed, the, danish, november, constitution, which, replaced, the, law, of, sj, lland, and, the, law, of, jutland, which, meant, the, new, constitution, applied, to, the, duchy, of, schleswig, the, german, confederation, saw, this, act, as, a, violation, of, the, london, protocol, of, 1852, which, emphasized, the, status, of, the, kingdom, of, denmark, as, distinct, from, the, three, independent, duchies, the, german, confederation, could, use, the, ethnicities, of, the, area, as, a, rallying, cry, holstein, and, lauenburg, were, largely, of, german, origin, and, spoke, german, in, everyday, life, while, schleswig, had, a, significant, danish, population, and, history, diplomatic, attempts, to, have, the, november, constitution, repealed, collapsed, and, fighting, began, when, prussian, and, austrian, troops, crossed, the, eider, river, on, 1, february, 1864, initially, the, danes, attempted, to, defend, their, country, using, an, ancient, earthen, wall, known, as, the, danevirke, but, this, proved, futile, the, danes, were, no, match, for, the, combined, prussian, and, austrian, forces, and, their, modern, armaments, the, needle, gun, one, of, the, first, bolt, action, rifles, to, be, used, in, conflict, aided, the, prussians, in, both, this, war, and, the, austro, prussian, war, two, years, later, the, rifle, enabled, a, prussian, soldier, to, fire, five, shots, while, lying, prone, while, its, muzzle, loading, counterpart, could, only, fire, one, shot, and, had, to, be, reloaded, while, standing, the, second, schleswig, war, resulted, in, victory, for, the, combined, armies, of, prussia, and, austria, and, the, two, countries, won, control, of, schleswig, and, holstein, in, the, concluding, peace, of, vienna, signed, on, 30, october, 1864, the, second, episode, in, bismarck, s, unification, efforts, occurred, in, 1866, in, concert, with, the, newly, formed, italy, bismarck, created, a, diplomatic, environment, in, which, austria, declared, war, on, prussia, the, dramatic, prelude, to, the, war, occurred, largely, in, frankfurt, where, the, two, powers, claimed, to, speak, for, all, the, german, states, in, the, parliament, in, april, 1866, the, prussian, representative, in, florence, signed, a, secret, agreement, with, the, italian, government, committing, each, state, to, assist, the, other, in, a, war, against, austria, the, next, day, the, prussian, delegate, to, the, frankfurt, assembly, presented, a, plan, calling, for, a, national, constitution, a, directly, elected, national, diet, and, universal, suffrage, german, liberals, were, justifiably, skeptical, of, this, plan, having, witnessed, bismarck, s, difficult, and, ambiguous, relationship, with, the, prussian, landtag, state, parliament, a, relationship, characterized, by, bismarck, s, cajoling, and, riding, roughshod, over, the, representatives, these, skeptics, saw, the, proposal, as, a, ploy, to, enhance, prussian, power, rather, than, a, progressive, agenda, of, reform, the, debate, over, the, proposed, national, constitution, became, moot, when, news, of, italian, troop, movements, in, tyrol, and, near, the, venetian, border, reached, vienna, in, april, 1866, the, austrian, government, ordered, partial, mobilization, in, the, southern, regions, the, italians, responded, by, ordering, full, mobilization, despite, calls, for, rational, thought, and, action, italy, prussia, and, austria, continued, to, rush, toward, armed, conflict, on, 1, may, wilhelm, gave, von, moltke, command, over, the, prussian, armed, forces, and, the, next, day, he, began, full, scale, mobilization, in, the, diet, the, group, of, middle, sized, states, known, as, mittelstaaten, bavaria, w, rttemberg, the, grand, duchies, of, baden, and, hesse, and, the, duchies, of, saxony, weimar, saxony, meiningen, saxony, coburg, and, nassau, supported, complete, demobilization, within, the, confederation, these, individual, governments, rejected, the, potent, combination, of, enticing, promises, and, subtle, or, outright, threats, bismarck, used, to, try, to, gain, their, support, against, the, habsburgs, the, prussian, war, cabinet, understood, that, its, only, supporters, among, the, german, states, against, the, habsburgs, were, two, small, principalities, bordering, on, brandenburg, that, had, little, military, strength, or, political, clout, the, grand, duchies, of, mecklenburg, schwerin, and, mecklenburg, strelitz, they, also, understood, that, prussia, s, only, ally, abroad, was, italy, opposition, to, prussia, s, strong, armed, tactics, surfaced, in, other, social, and, political, groups, throughout, the, german, states, city, councils, liberal, parliamentary, members, who, favored, a, unified, state, and, chambers, of, commerce, which, would, see, great, benefits, from, unification, opposed, any, war, between, prussia, and, austria, they, believed, any, such, conflict, would, only, serve, the, interests, of, royal, dynasties, their, own, interests, which, they, understood, as, civil, or, bourgeois, seemed, irrelevant, public, opinion, also, opposed, prussian, domination, catholic, populations, along, the, rhine, especially, in, such, cosmopolitan, regions, as, cologne, and, in, the, heavily, populated, ruhr, valley, continued, to, support, austria, by, late, spring, most, important, states, opposed, berlin, s, effort, to, reorganize, the, german, states, by, force, the, prussian, cabinet, saw, german, unity, as, an, issue, of, power, and, a, question, of, who, had, the, strength, and, will, to, wield, that, power, meanwhile, the, liberals, in, the, frankfurt, assembly, saw, german, unity, as, a, process, of, negotiation, that, would, lead, to, the, distribution, of, power, among, the, many, parties, although, several, german, states, initially, sided, with, austria, they, stayed, on, the, defensive, and, failed, to, take, effective, initiatives, against, prussian, troops, the, austrian, army, therefore, faced, the, technologically, superior, prussian, army, with, support, only, from, saxony, france, promised, aid, but, it, came, late, and, was, insufficient, complicating, the, situation, for, austria, the, italian, mobilization, on, austria, s, southern, border, required, a, diversion, of, forces, away, from, battle, with, prussia, to, fight, the, third, italian, war, of, independence, on, a, second, front, in, venetia, and, on, the, adriatic, sea, a, quick, peace, was, essential, to, keep, russia, from, entering, the, conflict, on, austria, s, side, in, the, day, long, battle, of, k, niggr, tz, near, the, village, of, sadov, friedrich, carl, and, his, troops, arrived, late, and, in, the, wrong, place, once, he, arrived, however, he, ordered, his, troops, immediately, into, the, fray, the, battle, was, a, decisive, victory, for, prussia, and, forced, the, habsburgs, to, end, the, war, with, the, unfavorable, peace, of, prague, laying, the, groundwork, for, the, kleindeutschland, little, germany, solution, or, germany, without, austria, there, is, in, political, geography, no, germany, proper, to, speak, of, there, are, kingdoms, and, grand, duchies, and, duchies, and, principalities, inhabited, by, germans, and, each, separately, ruled, by, an, independent, sovereign, with, all, the, machinery, of, state, yet, there, is, a, natural, undercurrent, tending, to, a, national, feeling, and, toward, a, union, of, the, germans, into, one, great, nation, ruled, by, one, common, head, as, a, national, unit, the, peace, of, prague, sealed, the, dissolution, of, the, german, confederation, its, former, leading, state, the, austrian, empire, was, along, with, the, majority, of, its, allies, excluded, from, the, ensuing, north, german, confederation, treaty, sponsored, by, prussia, which, directly, annexed, hanover, hesse, kassel, nassau, and, the, city, of, frankfurt, while, hesse, darmstadt, lost, some, territory, but, kept, its, statehood, at, the, same, time, the, original, east, prussian, cradle, of, the, prussian, statehood, as, well, as, the, prussian, held, polish, or, kashubian, speaking, territories, of, province, of, posen, and, west, prussia, were, formally, annexed, into, the, north, german, confederation, thus, germany, following, adoption, of, the, north, german, constitution, the, new, state, obtained, its, own, constitution, flag, and, governmental, and, administrative, structures, through, military, victory, prussia, under, bismarck, s, influence, had, overcome, austria, s, active, resistance, to, the, idea, of, a, unified, germany, the, states, south, of, the, main, river, baden, w, rttemberg, and, bavaria, signed, separate, treaties, requiring, them, to, pay, indemnities, and, to, form, alliances, bringing, them, into, prussia, s, sphere, of, influence, austria, s, influence, over, the, german, states, may, have, been, broken, but, the, war, also, splintered, the, spirit, of, pan, german, unity, as, many, german, states, resented, prussian, power, politics, the, peace, of, prague, offered, lenient, terms, to, austria, but, its, relationship, with, the, new, nation, state, of, italy, underwent, major, restructuring, although, the, austrians, were, far, more, successful, in, the, military, field, against, italian, troops, the, monarchy, lost, the, important, province, of, venetia, the, habsburgs, ceded, venetia, to, france, which, then, formally, transferred, control, to, italy, the, end, of, austrian, dominance, of, the, german, states, shifted, austria, s, attention, to, the, balkans, the, reality, of, defeat, for, austria, also, caused, a, reevaluation, of, internal, divisions, local, autonomy, and, liberalism, in, 1867, the, austrian, emperor, franz, joseph, accepted, a, settlement, the, austro, hungarian, compromise, of, 1867, in, which, he, gave, his, hungarian, holdings, equal, status, with, his, austrian, domains, creating, the, dual, monarchy, of, austria, hungary, the, french, public, resented, the, prussian, victory, and, demanded, revanche, pour, sadov, revenge, for, sadova, illustrating, anti, prussian, sentiment, in, france, a, problem, that, would, accelerate, in, the, months, leading, up, to, the, franco, prussian, war, the, austro, prussian, war, also, damaged, relations, with, the, french, government, at, a, meeting, in, biarritz, in, september, 1865, with, napoleon, iii, bismarck, had, let, it, be, understood, or, napoleon, had, thought, he, understood, that, france, might, annex, parts, of, belgium, and, luxembourg, in, exchange, for, its, neutrality, in, the, war, these, annexations, did, not, happen, resulting, in, animosity, from, napoleon, towards, bismarck, by, 1870, three, of, the, important, lessons, of, the, austro, prussian, war, had, become, apparent, the, first, lesson, was, that, through, force, of, arms, a, powerful, state, could, challenge, the, old, alliances, and, spheres, of, influence, established, in, 1815, second, through, diplomatic, maneuvering, a, skilful, leader, could, create, an, environment, in, which, a, rival, state, would, declare, war, first, thus, forcing, states, allied, with, the, victim, of, external, aggression, to, come, to, the, leader, s, aid, finally, as, prussian, military, capacity, far, exceeded, that, of, austria, prussia, was, clearly, the, only, state, within, the, confederation, or, among, the, german, states, generally, capable, of, protecting, all, of, them, from, potential, interference, or, aggression, in, 1866, most, mid, sized, german, states, had, opposed, prussia, but, by, 1870, these, states, had, been, coerced, and, coaxed, into, mutually, protective, alliances, with, prussia, if, a, european, state, declared, war, on, one, of, their, members, then, they, all, would, come, to, the, defense, of, the, attacked, state, with, skilful, manipulation, of, european, politics, bismarck, created, a, situation, in, which, france, would, play, the, role, of, aggressor, in, german, affairs, while, prussia, would, play, that, of, the, protector, of, german, rights, and, liberties, at, the, congress, of, vienna, in, 1815, metternich, and, his, conservative, allies, had, reestablished, the, spanish, monarchy, under, king, ferdinand, vii, over, the, following, forty, years, the, great, powers, supported, the, spanish, monarchy, but, events, in, 1868, would, further, test, the, old, system, finally, providing, the, external, trigger, needed, by, bismarck, a, revolution, in, spain, overthrew, queen, isabella, ii, and, the, throne, remained, empty, while, isabella, lived, in, sumptuous, exile, in, paris, the, spanish, looking, for, a, suitable, catholic, successor, had, offered, the, post, to, three, european, princes, each, of, whom, was, rejected, by, napoleon, iii, who, served, as, regional, power, broker, finally, in, 1870, the, regency, offered, the, crown, to, leopold, of, hohenzollern, sigmaringen, a, prince, of, the, catholic, cadet, hohenzollern, line, the, ensuing, furor, has, been, dubbed, by, historians, as, the, hohenzollern, candidature, over, the, next, few, weeks, the, spanish, offer, turned, into, the, talk, of, europe, bismarck, encouraged, leopold, to, accept, the, offer, a, successful, installment, of, a, hohenzollern, sigmaringen, king, in, spain, would, mean, that, two, countries, on, either, side, of, france, would, both, have, german, kings, of, hohenzollern, descent, this, may, have, been, a, pleasing, prospect, for, bismarck, but, it, was, unacceptable, to, either, napoleon, iii, or, to, agenor, duc, de, gramont, his, minister, of, foreign, affairs, gramont, wrote, a, sharply, formulated, ultimatum, to, wilhelm, as, head, of, the, hohenzollern, family, stating, that, if, any, hohenzollern, prince, should, accept, the, crown, of, spain, the, french, government, would, respond, although, he, left, ambiguous, the, nature, of, such, response, the, prince, withdrew, as, a, candidate, thus, defusing, the, crisis, but, the, french, ambassador, to, berlin, would, not, let, the, issue, lie, he, approached, the, prussian, king, directly, while, wilhelm, was, vacationing, in, ems, spa, demanding, that, the, king, release, a, statement, saying, he, would, never, support, the, installation, of, a, hohenzollern, on, the, throne, of, spain, wilhelm, refused, to, give, such, an, encompassing, statement, and, he, sent, bismarck, a, dispatch, by, telegram, describing, the, french, demands, bismarck, used, the, king, s, telegram, called, the, ems, dispatch, as, a, template, for, a, short, statement, to, the, press, with, its, wording, shortened, and, sharpened, by, bismarck, and, further, alterations, made, in, the, course, of, its, translation, by, the, french, agency, havas, the, ems, dispatch, raised, an, angry, furor, in, france, the, french, public, still, aggravated, over, the, defeat, at, sadov, demanded, war, napoleon, iii, had, tried, to, secure, territorial, concessions, from, both, sides, before, and, after, the, austro, prussian, war, but, despite, his, role, as, mediator, during, the, peace, negotiations, he, ended, up, with, nothing, he, then, hoped, that, austria, would, join, in, a, war, of, revenge, and, that, its, former, allies, particularly, the, southern, german, states, of, baden, w, rttemberg, and, bavaria, would, join, in, the, cause, this, hope, would, prove, futile, since, the, 1866, treaty, came, into, effect, and, united, all, german, states, militarily, if, not, happily, to, fight, against, france, instead, of, a, war, of, revenge, against, prussia, supported, by, various, german, allies, france, engaged, in, a, war, against, all, of, the, german, states, without, any, allies, of, its, own, the, reorganization, of, the, military, by, von, roon, and, the, operational, strategy, of, moltke, combined, against, france, to, great, effect, the, speed, of,

overwhelmed, french, mobilization, utilizing, their, efficiently, laid, rail, grid, prussian, troops, were, delivered, to, battle, areas, rested, and, prepared, to, fight, whereas, french, troops, had, to, march, for, considerable, distances, to, reach, combat, zones, after, a, number, of, battles, notably, spicheren, w, rth, mars, la, tour, and, gravelotte, the, prussians, defeated, the, main, french, armies, and, advanced, on, the, primary, city, of, metz, and, the, french, capital, of, paris, they, captured, napoleon, iii, and, took, an, entire, army, as, prisoners, at, sedan, on, 1, september, 1870, the, humiliating, capture, of, the, french, emperor, and, the, loss, of, the, french, army, itself, which, marched, into, captivity, at, a, makeshift, camp, in, the, saarland, camp, misery, threw, the, french, government, into, turmoil, napoleon, s, energetic, opponents, overthrew, his, government, and, proclaimed, the, third, republic, in, the, days, after, sedan, prussian, envoys, met, with, the, french, and, demanded, a, large, cash, indemnity, as, well, as, the, cession, of, alsace, and, lorraine, all, parties, in, france, rejected, the, terms, insisting, that, any, armistice, be, forged, on, the, basis, of, territorial, integrity, france, in, other, words, would, pay, reparations, for, starting, the, war, but, would, in, jules, favre, s, famous, phrase, cede, neither, a, clod, of, our, earth, nor, a, stone, of, our, fortresses, the, german, high, command, expected, an, overture, of, peace, from, the, french, but, the, new, republic, refused, to, surrender, the, prussian, army, invested, paris, and, held, it, under, siege, until, mid, january, with, the, city, being, ineffectually, bombarded, nevertheless, in, january, the, germans, fired, some, 12, 000, shells, 300, 400, grenades, daily, into, the, city, on, january, 18, 1871, the, german, princes, and, senior, military, commanders, proclaimed, wilhelm, german, emperor, in, the, hall, of, mirrors, at, the, palace, of, versailles, under, the, subsequent, treaty, of, frankfurt, france, relinquished, most, of, its, traditionally, german, regions, alsace, and, the, german, speaking, part, of, lorraine, paid, an, indemnity, calculated, on, the, basis, of, population, as, the, precise, equivalent, of, the, indemnity, that, napoleon, bonaparte, imposed, on, prussia, in, 1807, and, accepted, german, administration, of, paris, and, most, of, northern, france, with, german, troops, to, be, withdrawn, stage, by, stage, with, each, installment, of, the, indemnity, payment, victory, in, the, franco, prussian, war, proved, the, capstone, of, the, unification, process, in, the, first, half, of, the, 1860s, austria, and, prussia, both, contended, to, speak, for, the, german, states, both, maintained, they, could, support, german, interests, abroad, and, protect, german, interests, at, home, in, responding, to, the, schleswig, holstein, question, they, both, proved, equally, diligent, in, doing, so, after, the, victory, over, austria, in, 1866, prussia, began, internally, asserting, its, authority, to, speak, for, the, german, states, and, defend, german, interests, while, austria, began, directing, more, and, more, of, its, attention, to, possessions, in, the, balkans, the, victory, over, france, in, 1871, expanded, prussian, hegemony, in, the, german, states, aside, from, austria, to, the, international, level, with, the, proclamation, of, wilhelm, as, kaiser, prussia, assumed, the, leadership, of, the, new, empire, the, southern, states, became, officially, incorporated, into, a, unified, germany, at, the, treaty, of, versailles, of, 1871, signed, 26, february, 1871, later, ratified, in, the, treaty, of, frankfurt, of, 10, may, 1871, which, formally, ended, the, war, although, bismarck, had, led, the, transformation, of, germany, from, a, loose, confederation, into, a, federal, nation, state, he, had, not, done, it, alone, unification, was, achieved, by, building, on, a, tradition, of, legal, collaboration, under, the, holy, roman, empire, and, economic, collaboration, through, the, zollverein, the, difficulties, of, the, vorm, rz, the, impact, of, the, 1848, liberals, the, importance, of, von, roon, s, military, reorganization, and, von, moltke, s, strategic, brilliance, all, played, a, part, in, political, unification, einheit, unity, was, achieved, at, the, expense, of, freiheit, freedom, the, german, empire, became, in, karl, marx, s, words, a, military, despotism, cloaked, in, parliamentary, forms, with, a, feudal, ingredient, influenced, by, the, bourgeoisie, festooned, with, bureaucrats, and, guarded, by, police, indeed, many, historians, would, see, germany, s, escape, into, war, in, 1914, as, a, flight, from, all, of, the, internal, political, contradictions, forged, by, bismarck, at, versailles, in, the, fall, of, 1870, the, new, german, empire, included, 26, political, entities, twenty, five, constituent, states, or, bundesstaaten, and, one, imperial, territory, or, reichsland, it, realized, the, kleindeutsche, l, sung, lesser, german, solution, with, the, exclusion, of, austria, as, opposed, to, a, gro, deutsche, l, sung, or, greater, german, solution, which, would, have, included, austria, unifying, various, states, into, one, nation, required, more, than, some, military, victories, however, much, these, might, have, boosted, morale, it, also, required, a, rethinking, of, political, social, and, cultural, behaviors, and, the, construction, of, new, metaphors, about, us, and, them, who, were, the, new, members, of, this, new, nation, what, did, they, stand, for, how, were, they, to, be, organized, though, often, characterized, as, a, federation, of, monarchs, the, german, empire, strictly, speaking, federated, a, group, of, 26, constituent, entities, with, different, forms, of, government, ranging, from, the, main, four, constitutional, monarchies, to, the, three, republican, hanseatic, cities, the, 1866, north, german, constitution, became, with, some, semantic, adjustments, the, 1871, constitution, of, the, german, empire, with, this, constitution, the, new, germany, acquired, some, democratic, features, notably, the, imperial, diet, which, in, contrast, to, the, parliament, of, prussia, gave, citizens, representation, on, the, basis, of, elections, by, direct, and, equal, suffrage, of, all, males, who, had, reached, the, age, of, 25, furthermore, elections, were, generally, free, of, chicanery, engendering, pride, in, the, national, parliament, however, legislation, required, the, consent, of, the, bundesrat, the, federal, council, of, deputies, from, the, states, in, and, over, which, prussia, had, a, powerful, influence, prussia, could, appoint, 17, of, 58, delegates, with, only, 14, votes, needed, for, a, veto, prussia, thus, exercised, influence, in, both, bodies, with, executive, power, vested, in, the, prussian, king, as, kaiser, who, appointed, the, federal, chancellor, the, chancellor, was, accountable, solely, to, and, served, entirely, at, the, discretion, of, the, emperor, officially, the, chancellor, functioned, as, a, one, man, cabinet, and, was, responsible, for, the, conduct, of, all, state, affairs, in, practice, the, state, secretaries, bureaucratic, top, officials, in, charge, of, such, fields, as, finance, war, foreign, affairs, etc, acted, as, unofficial, portfolio, ministers, with, the, exception, of, the, years, 1872, 1873, and, 1892, 1894, the, imperial, chancellor, was, always, simultaneously, the, prime, minister, of, the, imperial, dynasty, s, hegemonic, home, kingdom, prussia, the, imperial, diet, had, the, power, to, pass, amend, or, reject, bills, but, it, could, not, initiate, legislation, the, power, of, initiating, legislation, rested, with, the, chancellor, the, other, states, retained, their, own, governments, but, the, military, forces, of, the, smaller, states, came, under, prussian, control, the, militaries, of, the, larger, states, such, as, the, kingdoms, of, bavaria, and, saxony, retained, some, autonomy, but, they, underwent, major, reforms, to, coordinate, with, prussian, military, principles, and, came, under, federal, government, control, in, wartime, the, sonderweg, hypothesis, attributed, germany, s, difficult, 20th, century, to, the, weak, political, legal, and, economic, basis, of, the, new, empire, the, prussian, landed, elites, the, junkers, retained, a, substantial, share, of, political, power, in, the, unified, state, the, sonderweg, hypothesis, attributed, their, power, to, the, absence, of, a, revolutionary, breakthrough, by, the, middle, classes, or, by, peasants, in, combination, with, the, urban, workers, in, 1848, and, again, in, 1871, recent, research, into, the, role, of, the, grand, bourgeoisie, which, included, bankers, merchants, industrialists, and, entrepreneurs, in, the, construction, of, the, new, state, has, largely, refuted, the, claim, of, political, and, economic, dominance, of, the, junkers, as, a, social, group, this, newer, scholarship, has, demonstrated, the, importance, of, the, merchant, classes, of, the, hanseatic, cities, and, the, industrial, leadership, the, latter, particularly, important, in, the, rhineland, in, the, ongoing, development, of, the, second, empire, additional, studies, of, different, groups, in, wilhelmine, germany, have, all, contributed, to, a, new, view, of, the, period, although, the, junkers, did, indeed, continue, to, control, the, officer, corps, they, did, not, dominate, social, political, and, economic, matters, as, much, as, the, sonderweg, theorists, had, hypothesized, eastern, junker, power, had, a, counterweight, in, the, western, provinces, in, the, form, of, the, grand, bourgeoisie, and, in, the, growing, professional, class, of, bureaucrats, teachers, professors, doctors, lawyers, scientists, etc, if, the, wartburg, and, hambach, rallies, had, lacked, a, constitution, and, administrative, apparatus, that, problem, was, addressed, between, 1867, and, 1871, yet, as, germans, discovered, grand, speeches, flags, and, enthusiastic, crowds, a, constitution, a, political, reorganization, and, the, provision, of, an, imperial, superstructure, and, the, revised, customs, union, of, 1867, 68, still, did, not, make, a, nation, a, key, element, of, the, nation, state, is, the, creation, of, a, national, culture, frequently, although, not, necessarily, through, deliberate, national, policy, in, the, new, german, nation, a, kulturkampf, 1872, 78, that, followed, political, economic, and, administrative, unification, attempted, to, address, with, a, remarkable, lack, of, success, some, of, the, contradictions, in, german, society, in, particular, it, involved, a, struggle, over, language, education, and, religion, a, policy, of, germanization, of, non, german, people, of, the, empire, s, population, including, the, polish, and, danish, minorities, started, with, language, in, particular, the, german, language, compulsory, schooling, germanization, and, the, attempted, creation, of, standardized, curricula, for, those, schools, to, promote, and, celebrate, the, idea, of, a, shared, past, finally, it, extended, to, the, religion, of, the, new, empire, s, population, for, some, germans, the, definition, of, nation, did, not, include, pluralism, and, catholics, in, particular, came, under, scrutiny, some, germans, and, especially, bismarck, feared, that, the, catholics, connection, to, the, papacy, might, make, them, less, loyal, to, the, nation, as, chancellor, bismarck, tried, without, much, success, to, limit, the, influence, of, the, roman, catholic, church, and, of, its, party, political, arm, the, catholic, centre, party, in, schools, and, education, and, language, related, policies, the, catholic, centre, party, remained, particularly, well, entrenched, in, the, catholic, strongholds, of, bavaria, and, southern, baden, and, in, urban, areas, that, held, high, populations, of, displaced, rural, workers, seeking, jobs, in, the, heavy, industry, and, sought, to, protect, the, rights, not, only, of, catholics, but, other, minorities, including, the, poles, and, the, french, minorities, in, the, alsatian, lands, the, may, laws, of, 1873, brought, the, appointment, of, priests, and, their, education, under, the, control, of, the, state, resulting, in, the, closure, of, many, seminaries, and, a, shortage, of, priests, the, congregations, law, of, 1875, abolished, religious, orders, ended, state, subsidies, to, the, catholic, church, and, removed, religious, protections, from, the, prussian, constitution, the, germanized, jews, remained, another, vulnerable, population, in, the, new, german, nation, state, since, 1780, after, emancipation, by, the, holy, roman, emperor, joseph, ii, jews, in, the, former, habsburg, territories, had, enjoyed, considerable, economic, and, legal, privileges, that, their, counterparts, in, other, german, speaking, territories, did, not, they, could, own, land, for, example, and, they, did, not, have, to, live, in, a, jewish, quarter, also, called, the, judengasse, or, jews, alley, they, could, also, attend, universities, and, enter, the, professions, during, the, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, eras, many, of, the, previously, strong, barriers, between, jews, and, christians, broke, down, napoleon, had, ordered, the, emancipation, of, jews, throughout, territories, under, french, hegemony, like, their, french, counterparts, wealthy, german, jews, sponsored, salons, in, particular, several, jewish, salonni, res, held, important, gatherings, in, frankfurt, and, berlin, during, which, german, intellectuals, developed, their, own, form, of, republican, intellectualism, throughout, the, subsequent, decades, beginning, almost, immediately, after, the, defeat, of, the, french, reaction, against, the, mixing, of, jews, and, christians, limited, the, intellectual, impact, of, these, salons, beyond, the, salons, jews, continued, a, process, of, germanization, in, which, they, intentionally, adopted, german, modes, of, dress, and, speech, working, to, insert, themselves, into, the, emerging, 19th, century, german, public, sphere, the, religious, reform, movement, among, german, jews, reflected, this, effort, by, the, years, of, unification, german, jews, played, an, important, role, in, the, intellectual, underpinnings, of, the, german, professional, intellectual, and, social, life, the, expulsion, of, jews, from, russia, in, the, 1880s, and, 1890s, complicated, integration, into, the, german, public, sphere, russian, jews, arrived, in, north, german, cities, in, the, thousands, considerably, less, educated, and, less, affluent, their, often, dismal, poverty, dismayed, many, of, the, germanized, jews, many, of, the, problems, related, to, poverty, such, as, illness, overcrowded, housing, unemployment, school, absenteeism, refusal, to, learn, german, etc, emphasized, their, distinctiveness, for, not, only, the, christian, germans, but, for, the, local, jewish, populations, as, well, another, important, element, in, nation, building, the, story, of, the, heroic, past, fell, to, such, nationalist, german, historians, as, the, liberal, constitutionalist, friedrich, dahlmann, 1785, 1860, his, conservative, student, heinrich, von, treitschke, 1834, 1896, and, others, less, conservative, such, as, theodor, mommsen, 1817, 1903, and, heinrich, von, sybel, 1817, 1895, to, name, two, dahlmann, himself, died, before, unification, but, he, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, nationalist, histories, to, come, through, his, histories, of, the, english, and, french, revolutions, by, casting, these, revolutions, as, fundamental, to, the, construction, of, a, nation, and, dahlmann, himself, viewed, prussia, as, the, logical, agent, of, unification, heinrich, von, treitschke, s, history, of, germany, in, the, nineteenth, century, published, in, 1879, has, perhaps, a, misleading, title, it, privileges, the, history, of, prussia, over, the, history, of, other, german, states, and, it, tells, the, story, of, the, german, speaking, peoples, through, the, guise, of, prussia, s, destiny, to, unite, all, german, states, under, its, leadership, the, creation, of, this, borussian, myth, borussia, is, the, latin, name, for, prussia, established, prussia, as, germany, s, savior, it, was, the, destiny, of, all, germans, to, be, united, this, myth, maintains, and, it, was, prussia, s, destiny, to, accomplish, this, according, to, this, story, prussia, played, the, dominant, role, in, bringing, the, german, states, together, as, a, nation, state, only, prussia, could, protect, german, liberties, from, being, crushed, by, french, or, russian, influence, the, story, continues, by, drawing, on, prussia, s, role, in, saving, germans, from, the, resurgence, of, napoleon, s, power, in, 1815, at, waterloo, creating, some, semblance, of, economic, unity, and, uniting, germans, under, one, proud, flag, after, 1871, mommsen, s,

other, areas, beyond, prussia, a, liberal, professor, historian, and, theologian, and, generally, a, titan, among, late, 19th, century, scholars, mommsen, served, as, a, delegate, to, the, prussian, house, of, representatives, from, 1863, to, 1866, and, 1873, to, 1879, he, also, served, as, a, delegate, to, the, reichstag, from, 1881, to, 1884, for, the, liberal, german, progress, party,
