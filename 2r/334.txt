the, lombards, l, m, b, r, d, z, b, r, d, z, l, m, or, longobards, latin, longobardi, were, a, germanic, people, who, conquered, most, of, the, italian, peninsula, between, 568, and, 774, the, medieval, lombard, historian, paul, the, deacon, wrote, in, the, history, of, the, lombards, written, between, 787, and, 796, that, the, lombards, descended, from, a, small, tribe, called, the, winnili, who, dwelt, in, northern, germany, before, migrating, to, seek, new, lands, earlier, roman, era, historians, wrote, of, the, lombards, in, the, first, century, ad, as, being, one, of, the, suebian, peoples, also, from, what, is, now, northern, germany, near, the, elbe, river, they, migrated, south, and, by, the, end, of, the, fifth, century, the, lombards, had, moved, into, the, area, roughly, coinciding, with, modern, austria, and, slovakia, north, of, the, danube, here, they, subdued, the, heruls, and, later, fought, frequent, wars, with, the, gepids, the, lombard, king, audoin, defeated, the, gepid, leader, thurisind, in, 551, or, 552, and, audoin, s, successor, alboin, eventually, destroyed, the, gepids, in, 567, the, lombards, also, settled, in, pannonia, modern, day, hungary, near, sz, l, d, archaeologists, have, unearthed, burial, sites, of, lombard, men, and, women, buried, together, as, families, unusual, among, germanic, peoples, at, the, time, contemporary, traces, have, also, been, discovered, of, mediterranean, greeks, and, a, possible, migrant, from, france, following, alboin, s, victory, over, the, gepids, he, led, his, people, into, north, eastern, italy, which, had, become, severely, depopulated, and, devastated, after, the, long, gothic, war, 535, 554, between, the, byzantine, empire, and, the, ostrogothic, kingdom, the, lombards, were, joined, by, numerous, saxons, heruls, gepids, bulgars, thuringians, and, ostrogoths, and, their, invasion, of, italy, was, almost, unopposed, by, late, 569, they, had, conquered, all, of, northern, italy, and, the, principal, cities, north, of, the, po, river, except, pavia, which, fell, in, 572, at, the, same, time, they, occupied, areas, in, central, and, southern, italy, they, established, a, lombard, kingdom, in, north, and, central, italy, which, reached, its, zenith, under, the, eighth, century, ruler, liutprand, in, 774, the, kingdom, was, conquered, by, the, frankish, king, charlemagne, and, integrated, into, the, frankish, empire, however, lombard, nobles, continued, to, rule, southern, parts, of, the, italian, peninsula, well, into, the, eleventh, century, when, they, were, conquered, by, the, normans, and, added, to, the, county, of, sicily, in, this, period, the, southern, part, of, italy, still, under, lombard, domination, was, known, to, the, norse, as, langbar, aland, land, of, the, lombards, as, inscribed, in, the, norse, runestones, their, legacy, is, also, apparent, in, the, name, of, the, region, of, lombardy, in, northern, italy, according, to, their, traditions, the, lombards, initially, called, themselves, the, winnili, after, a, reported, major, victory, against, the, vandals, in, the, first, century, they, changed, their, name, to, lombards, the, name, winnili, is, generally, translated, as, the, wolves, related, to, the, proto, germanic, root, wulfaz, wolf, the, name, lombard, was, reportedly, derived, from, the, distinctively, long, beards, of, the, lombards, it, is, probably, a, compound, of, the, proto, germanic, elements, langaz, long, and, bardaz, beard, another, widely, accepted, etymology, can, be, traced, to, illyrian, albanian, lumbarda, lumbardha, white, river, according, to, their, own, legends, the, lombards, originated, in, northern, germany, denmark, zone, including, modern, day, denmark, the, germanic, origins, of, the, lombards, is, supported, by, genetic, anthropological, archaeological, and, earlier, literary, evidence, a, legendary, account, of, lombard, origins, history, and, practices, is, the, historia, langobardorum, history, of, the, lombards, of, paul, the, deacon, written, in, the, eighth, century, paul, s, chief, source, for, lombard, origins, however, is, the, seventh, century, origo, gentis, langobardorum, origin, of, the, lombard, people, the, origo, gentis, langobardorum, tells, the, story, of, a, small, tribe, called, the, winnili, dwelling, in, northern, germany, denmark, zone, the, historia, langobardorum, codicis, gothani, writes, that, the, winnili, first, dwelt, near, a, river, called, vindilicus, on, the, extreme, boundary, of, gaul, the, winnili, were, split, into, three, groups, and, one, part, left, their, native, land, to, seek, foreign, fields, the, reason, for, the, exodus, was, probably, overpopulation, the, departing, people, were, led, by, gambara, and, her, sons, ybor, and, aio, and, arrived, in, the, lands, of, scoringa, perhaps, the, baltic, coast, or, the, bardengau, on, the, banks, of, the, elbe, scoringa, was, ruled, by, the, vandals, and, their, chieftains, the, brothers, ambri, and, assi, who, granted, the, winnili, a, choice, between, tribute, or, war, the, winnili, were, young, and, brave, and, refused, to, pay, tribute, saying, it, is, better, to, maintain, liberty, by, arms, than, to, stain, it, by, the, payment, of, tribute, the, vandals, prepared, for, war, and, consulted, godan, the, god, odin, who, answered, that, he, would, give, victory, to, those, whom, he, would, see, first, at, sunrise, the, winnili, were, fewer, in, number, and, gambara, sought, help, from, frea, the, goddess, frigg, who, advised, that, all, winnili, women, should, tie, their, hair, in, front, of, their, faces, like, beards, and, march, in, line, with, their, husbands, at, sunrise, frea, turned, her, husband, s, bed, so, that, he, was, facing, east, and, woke, him, so, godan, spotted, the, winnili, first, and, asked, who, are, these, long, beards, and, frea, replied, my, lord, thou, hast, given, them, the, name, now, give, them, also, the, victory, from, that, moment, onwards, the, winnili, were, known, as, the, longbeards, latinised, as, langobardi, italianised, as, longobardi, and, anglicized, as, langobards, or, lombards, when, paul, the, deacon, wrote, the, historia, between, 787, and, 796, he, was, a, catholic, monk, and, devoted, christian, he, thought, the, pagan, stories, of, his, people, silly, and, laughable, paul, explained, that, the, name, langobard, came, from, the, length, of, their, beards, a, modern, theory, suggests, that, the, name, langobard, comes, from, langbar, r, a, name, of, odin, priester, states, that, when, the, winnili, changed, their, name, to, lombards, they, also, changed, their, old, agricultural, fertility, cult, to, a, cult, of, odin, thus, creating, a, conscious, tribal, tradition, fr, hlich, inverts, the, order, of, events, in, priester, and, states, that, with, the, odin, cult, the, lombards, grew, their, beards, in, resemblance, of, the, odin, of, tradition, and, their, new, name, reflected, this, bruckner, remarks, that, the, name, of, the, lombards, stands, in, close, relation, to, the, worship, of, odin, whose, many, names, include, the, long, bearded, or, the, grey, bearded, and, that, the, lombard, given, name, ansegranus, he, with, the, beard, of, the, gods, shows, that, the, lombards, had, this, idea, of, their, chief, deity, the, same, old, norse, root, barth, or, bar, i, meaning, beard, is, shared, with, the, hea, obards, mentioned, in, both, beowulf, and, in, widsith, where, they, conflict, with, the, danes, they, were, possibly, a, branch, of, the, langobards, alternatively, some, etymological, sources, suggest, an, old, high, german, root, barta, meaning, axe, and, related, to, english, halberd, while, edward, gibbon, puts, forth, an, alternative, suggestion, which, argues, that, b, rde, or, b, rd, still, signifies, a, fertile, plain, by, the, side, of, a, river, and, a, district, near, magdeburg, is, still, called, the, lange, b, rde, according, to, this, view, langobardi, would, signify, inhabitants, of, the, long, bord, of, the, river, and, traces, of, their, name, are, supposed, still, to, occur, in, such, names, as, bardengau, and, bardewick, in, the, neighborhood, of, the, elbe, according, to, the, gallaecian, christian, priest, historian, and, theologian, paulus, orosius, translated, by, daines, barrington, the, lombards, or, winnili, lived, originally, in, the, vinuiloth, vinovilith, mentioned, by, jordanes, in, his, masterpiece, getica, to, the, north, of, uppsala, sweden, scoringa, was, near, the, province, of, uppland, so, just, north, of, sterg, tland, the, footnote, then, explains, the, etymology, of, the, name, scoringa, the, shores, of, uppland, and, sterg, tland, are, covered, with, small, rocks, and, rocky, islands, which, are, called, in, german, sch, ren, and, in, swedish, skiaeren, heal, signifies, a, port, in, the, northern, languages, consequently, ski, ren, heal, is, the, port, of, the, ski, ren, a, name, well, adapted, to, the, port, of, stockholm, in, the, upplandske, ski, ren, and, the, country, may, be, justly, called, scorung, or, ski, runga, the, legendary, king, sceafa, of, scandza, was, an, ancient, lombardic, king, in, anglo, saxon, legend, the, old, english, poem, widsith, in, a, listing, of, famous, kings, and, their, countries, has, sceafa, longbeardum, so, naming, sceafa, as, ruler, of, the, lombards, similarities, between, langobardic, and, gothic, migration, traditions, have, been, noted, among, scholars, these, early, migration, legends, suggest, that, a, major, shifting, of, tribes, occurred, sometime, between, the, first, and, second, century, bc, which, would, coincide, with, the, time, that, the, teutoni, and, cimbri, left, their, homelands, in, northern, germany, and, migrated, through, central, germany, eventually, invading, roman, italy, the, first, mention, of, the, lombards, occurred, between, ad, 9, and, 16, by, the, roman, court, historian, velleius, paterculus, who, accompanied, a, roman, expedition, as, prefect, of, the, cavalry, paterculus, says, that, under, tiberius, the, power, of, the, langobardi, was, broken, a, race, surpassing, even, the, germans, in, savagery, from, the, combined, testimony, of, strabo, ad, 20, and, tacitus, ad, 117, the, lombards, dwelt, near, the, mouth, of, the, elbe, shortly, after, the, beginning, of, the, christian, era, next, to, the, chauci, strabo, states, that, the, lombards, dwelt, on, both, sides, of, the, elbe, he, treats, them, as, a, branch, of, the, suebi, and, states, that, now, as, for, the, tribe, of, the, suebi, it, is, the, largest, for, it, extends, from, the, rhenus, to, the, albis, and, a, part, of, them, even, dwells, on, the, far, side, of, the, albis, as, for, instance, the, hermondori, and, the, langobardi, and, at, the, present, time, these, latter, at, least, have, to, the, last, man, been, driven, in, flight, out, of, their, country, into, the, land, on, the, far, side, of, the, river, consistent, with, this, suetonius, wrote, that, roman, general, nero, claudius, drusus, defeated, a, large, force, of, germans, and, drove, some, to, the, farther, side, of, the, albis, elbe, river, the, german, archaeologist, willi, wegewitz, defined, several, iron, age, burial, sites, at, the, lower, elbe, as, langobardic, 19, the, burial, sites, are, crematorial, and, are, usually, dated, from, the, sixth, century, bc, through, the, third, century, ad, so, a, settlement, breakoff, seems, unlikely, the, lands, of, the, lower, elbe, fall, into, the, zone, of, the, jastorf, culture, and, became, elbe, germanic, differing, from, the, lands, between, rhine, weser, and, the, north, sea, archaeological, finds, show, that, the, lombards, were, an, agricultural, people, tacitus, also, counted, the, lombards, as, a, remote, and, aggressive, suebian, tribe, listing, them, between, the, semnones, on, the, elbe, and, the, nerthus, worshipping, tribes, whose, land, of, rivers, and, forest, stretched, to, the, sea, writing, in, the, late, first, century, ad, he, described, the, langobardi, in, his, germania, saying, that, their, scanty, numbers, are, a, distinction, because, surrounded, by, a, host, of, most, powerful, tribes, they, are, safe, not, by, submitting, but, by, daring, the, perils, of, war, tacitus, also, noted, that, the, lombards, were, subjects, of, marobod, the, king, of, the, marcomanni, who, was, allied, with, rome, when, arminius, and, his, allies, won, the, battle, of, teutoburg, forest, in, 9, ad, however, after, the, outbreak, of, war, between, arminius, and, marobod, in, 17, ad, the, lombards, and, semnones, switched, to, the, alliance, of, arminius, they, detested, marobod, s, title, of, king, and, saw, arminius, as, a, champion, of, freedom, in, 47, a, struggle, ensued, amongst, the, cherusci, and, they, expelled, their, new, leader, the, nephew, of, arminius, from, their, country, the, lombards, appeared, on, the, scene, with, sufficient, power, to, control, the, destiny, of, the, tribe, that, had, been, the, leader, in, the, struggle, for, independence, thirty, eight, years, earlier, for, they, restored, the, deposed, leader, to, sovereignty, to, the, south, in, 166, cassius, dio, reported, that, just, before, the, marcomannic, wars, 6, 000, lombards, and, obii, sometimes, thought, to, be, ubii, crossed, the, danube, and, invaded, pannonia, the, two, tribes, were, defeated, whereupon, they, ceased, their, invasion, and, sent, ballomar, king, of, the, marcomanni, as, ambassador, to, aelius, bassus, who, was, then, administering, pannonia, peace, was, made, and, the, two, tribes, returned, to, their, homes, which, in, the, case, of, the, lombards, was, the, lands, of, the, lower, elbe, in, the, mid, second, century, the, lombards, supposedly, appeared, in, the, rhineland, because, according, to, claudius, ptolemy, the, suebic, lombards, lived, below, the, bructeri, and, sugambri, and, between, these, and, the, tencteri, to, their, east, stretching, northwards, to, the, central, elbe, are, the, suebi, angili, but, ptolemy, also, mentions, the, laccobardi, to, the, north, of, the, above, mentioned, suebic, territories, east, of, the, angrivarii, on, the, weser, and, south, of, the, chauci, on, the, coast, probably, indicating, a, lombard, expansion, from, the, elbe, to, the, rhine, this, double, mention, has, been, interpreted, as, an, editorial, error, by, gudmund, sch, tte, in, his, analysis, of, ptolemy, however, the, historia, langobardorum, codicis, gothani, also, mentions, patespruna, paderborn, in, connection, with, the, lombards, from, the, second, century, onwards, many, of, the, germanic, tribes, recorded, as, active, during, the, principate, started, to, unite, into, bigger, tribal, unions, such, as, the, franks, alamanni, bavarii, and, saxons, the, lombards, are, not, mentioned, at, first, perhaps, because, they, were, not, initially, on, the, border, of, rome, or, perhaps, because, they, were, subjected, to, a, larger, tribal, union, like, the, saxons, it, is, however, highly, probable, that, when, the, bulk, of, the, lombards, migrated, a, considerable, part, remained, behind, and, afterwards, became, absorbed, by, the, saxon, tribes, in, the, elbe, region, while, the, emigrants, alone, retained, the, name, of, lombards, however, the, historia, langobardorum, codicis, gothani, states, that, the, lombards, were, subjected, by, the, saxons, around, 300, but, rose, up, against, them, under, their, first, king, agelmund, who, ruled, for, 30, years, in, the, second, half, of, the, fourth, century, the, lombards, left, their, homes, probably, due, to, bad, harvests, and, embarked, on, their, migration, the, migration, route, of, the, lombards, in, 489, from, their, homeland, to, rugiland, encompassed, several, places, scoringa, believed, to, be, their, land, on, the, elbe, shores, mauringa, golanda, anthaib, banthaib, and, vurgundaib, burgundaib, according, to, the, ravenna, cosmography, mauringa, was, the, land, east, of, the, elbe, the, crossing, into, mauringa, was, very, difficult, the, assipitti, possibly, the, usipetes, denied, them, passage, through, their, lands, and, a, fight, was, arranged, for, the, strongest, man, of, each, tribe, the, lombard, was, victorious, passage, was, granted, and, the, lombards, reached, mauringa, the, lombards, departed, from, mauringa, and, reached, golanda, scholar, ludwig, schmidt, thinks, this, was, further, east, perhaps, on, the, right, bank, of, the, oder, schmidt, considers, the, name, the, equivalent, of, gotland, meaning, simply, good, land, this, theory, is, highly, plausible, paul, the, deacon, mentions, the, lombards, crossing, a, river, and, they, could, have, reached, rugiland, from, the, upper, oder, area, via, the, moravian, gate, moving, out, of, golanda, the, lombards, passed, through, anthaib, and, banthaib, until, they, reached, vurgundaib, believed, to, be, the, old, lands, of, the, burgundes, in, vurgundaib, the, lombards, were, stormed, in, camp, by, bulgars, probably, huns, and, were, defeated, king, agelmund, was, killed, and, laimicho, was, made, king, he, was, in, his, youth, and, desired, to, avenge, the, slaughter, of, agelmund, the, lombards, themselves, were, probably, made, subjects, of, the, huns, after, the, defeat, but, rose, up, and, defeated, them, with, great, slaughter, gaining, great, booty, and, confidence, as, they, became, bolder, in, undertaking, the, toils, of, war, during, the, reign, of, king, claffo, the, langobards, occupied, parts, of, modern, day, upper, and, lower, austria, and, converted, to, arian, christianity, in, 505, the, herulians, attacked, and, defeated, them, obliging, them, to, pay, tax, and, withdraw, to, northern, bohemia, in, 508, king, rodulf, sent, his, brother, to, the, lombard, court, to, collect, tribute, and, extend, the, truce, however, he, was, stabbed, by, rometrud, sister, of, king, tato, rodulf, personally, led, his, forces, against, tato, but, was, ambushed, and, killed, from, a, hill, in, the, 540s, audoin, ruled, 546, 560, led, the, lombards, across, the, danube, once, more, into, pannonia, thurisind, king, of, the, gepids, attempted, to, expel, them, and, both, peoples, asked, for, help, from, the, byzantines, justinian, i, sent, his, army, against, the, gepids, however, it, was, routed, on, the, way, by, the, herulians, and, the, sides, signed, a, two, year, truce, revenging, what, he, felt, as, a, betrayal, thurisind, made, an, alliance, with, the, kutrigurs, who, devastated, moesia, before, end, of, the, armistice, the, langobard, and, roman, army, joined, together, and, defeated, the, gepids, in, 551, in, the, battle, audoin, s, son, alboin, killed, thurisind, s, son, turismod, in, 552, the, byzantines, aided, by, a, large, contingent, of, foederati, notably, lombards, heruls, and, bulgars, defeated, the, last, ostrogoths, led, by, teia, in, the, battle, of, taginae, in, approximately, 560, audoin, was, succeeded, by, his, son, alboin, a, young, and, energetic, leader, who, defeated, the, neighboring, gepidae, and, made, them, his, subjects, in, 566, he, married, rosamund, daughter, of, the, gepid, king, cunimund, in, the, same, year, he, made, a, pact, with, khagan, bayan, next, year, the, lombards, and, the, avars, destroyed, the, gepid, kingdom, in, the, lombard, gepid, war, the, allies, halved, the, prize, of, war, and, the, nomads, settled, in, transylvania, in, the, spring, of, 568, alboin, now, fearing, the, aggressive, avars, led, the, lombard, migration, into, italy, which, he, planned, for, years, according, to, the, history, of, the, lombards, then, the, langobards, having, left, pannonia, hastened, to, take, possession, of, italy, with, their, wives, and, children, and, all, their, goods, the, avars, have, agreed, to, shelter, them, if, they, wish, to, come, back, various, other, peoples, who, either, voluntarily, joined, or, were, subjects, of, king, alboin, were, also, part, of, the, migration, whence, even, until, today, we, call, the, villages, in, which, they, dwell, gepidan, bulgarian, sarmatian, pannonian, suabian, norican, or, by, other, names, of, this, kind, at, least, 20, 000, saxon, warriors, old, allies, of, the, lombards, and, their, families, joined, them, in, their, new, migration, the, first, important, city, to, fall, was, forum, iulii, cividale, del, friuli, in, northeastern, italy, in, 569, there, alboin, created, the, first, lombard, duchy, which, he, entrusted, to, his, nephew, gisulf, soon, vicenza, verona, and, brescia, fell, into, germanic, hands, in, the, summer, of, 569, the, lombards, conquered, the, main, roman, centre, of, northern, italy, milan, the, area, was, then, recovering, from, the, terrible, gothic, wars, and, the, small, byzantine, army, left, for, its, defence, could, do, almost, nothing, longinus, the, exarch, sent, to, italy, by, emperor, justin, ii, could, only, defend, coastal, cities, that, could, be, supplied, by, the, powerful, byzantine, fleet, pavia, fell, after, a, siege, of, three, years, in, 572, becoming, the, first, capital, city, of, the, new, lombard, kingdom, of, italy, in, the, following, years, the, lombards, penetrated, further, south, conquering, tuscany, and, establishing, two, duchies, spoleto, and, benevento, under, zotto, which, soon, became, semi, independent, and, even, outlasted, the, northern, kingdom, surviving, well, into, the, twelfth, century, wherever, they, went, they, were, joined, by, the, ostrogothic, population, which, was, allowed, to, live, peacefully, in, italy, with, their, rugian, allies, under, roman, sovereignty, the, byzantines, managed, to, retain, control, of, the, area, of, ravenna, and, rome, linked, by, a, thin, corridor, running, through, perugia, when, they, entered, italy, some, lombards, retained, their, native, form, of, paganism, while, some, were, arian, christians, hence, they, did, not, enjoy, good, relations, with, the, early, christian, church, gradually, they, adopted, roman, or, romanized, titles, names, and, traditions, and, partially, converted, to, orthodoxy, in, the, seventh, century, though, not, without, a, long, series, of, religious, and, ethnic, conflicts, by, the, time, paul, the, deacon, was, writing, the, lombard, language, dress, and, even, hairstyles, had, nearly, all, disappeared, in, toto, the, whole, lombard, territory, was, divided, into, 36, duchies, whose, leaders, settled, in, the, main, cities, the, king, ruled, over, them, and, administered, the, land, through, emissaries, called, gastaldi, this, subdivision, however, together, with, the, independent, indocility, of, the, duchies, deprived, the, kingdom, of, unity, making, it, weak, even, when, compared, to, the, byzantines, especially, since, these, had, begun, to, recover, from, the, initial, invasion, this, weakness, became, even, more, evident, when, the, lombards, had, to, face, the, increasing, power, of, the, franks, in, response, the, kings, tried, to, centralize, power, over, time, but, they, definitively, lost, control, over, spoleto, and, benevento, in, the, attempt, in, 572, alboin, was, murdered, in, verona, in, a, plot, led, by, his, wife, rosamund, who, later, fled, to, ravenna, his, successor, cleph, was, also, assassinated, after, a, ruthless, reign, of, 18, months, his, death, began, an, interregnum, of, years, the, rule, of, the, dukes, during, which, the, dukes, did, not, elect, any, king, a, period, regarded, as, a, time, of, violence, and, disorder, in, 586, threatened, by, a, frankish, invasion, the, dukes, elected, cleph, s, son, authari, as, king, in, 589, he, married, theodelinda, daughter, of, garibald, i, of, bavaria, the, duke, of, bavaria, the, catholic, theodelinda, was, a, friend, of, pope, gregory, i, and, pushed, for, christianization, in, the, meantime, authari, embarked, on, a, policy, of, internal,

also, married, theodelinda, in, the, same, year, agilulf, successfully, fought, the, rebel, dukes, of, northern, italy, conquering, padua, in, 601, cremona, and, mantua, in, 603, and, forcing, the, exarch, of, ravenna, to, pay, tribute, agilulf, died, in, 616, theodelinda, reigned, alone, until, 628, when, she, was, succeeded, by, adaloald, arioald, the, head, of, the, arian, opposition, who, had, married, theodelinda, s, daughter, gundeperga, later, deposed, adaloald, arioald, was, succeeded, by, rothari, regarded, by, many, authorities, as, the, most, energetic, of, all, lombard, kings, he, extended, his, dominions, conquering, liguria, in, 643, and, the, remaining, part, of, the, byzantine, territories, of, inner, veneto, including, the, roman, city, of, opitergium, oderzo, rothari, also, made, the, famous, edict, bearing, his, name, the, edictum, rothari, which, established, the, laws, and, the, customs, of, his, people, in, latin, the, edict, did, not, apply, to, the, tributaries, of, the, lombards, who, could, retain, their, own, laws, rothari, s, son, rodoald, succeeded, him, in, 652, still, very, young, and, was, killed, by, his, opponents, at, the, death, of, king, aripert, i, in, 661, the, kingdom, was, split, between, his, children, perctarit, who, set, his, capital, in, milan, and, godepert, who, reigned, from, pavia, ticinum, perctarit, was, overthrown, by, grimoald, son, of, gisulf, duke, of, friuli, and, benevento, since, 647, perctarit, fled, to, the, avars, and, then, to, the, franks, grimoald, managed, to, regain, control, over, the, duchies, and, deflected, the, late, attempt, of, the, byzantine, emperor, constans, ii, to, conquer, southern, italy, he, also, defeated, the, franks, at, grimoald, s, death, in, 671, perctarit, returned, and, promoted, tolerance, between, arians, and, catholics, but, he, could, not, defeat, the, arian, party, led, by, arachi, duke, of, trento, who, submitted, only, to, his, son, the, philo, catholic, cunincpert, the, lombards, engaged, in, fierce, battles, with, slavic, peoples, during, these, years, from, 623, to, 626, the, lombards, unsuccessfully, attacked, the, carantanians, and, in, 663, 64, the, slavs, raided, the, vipava, valley, and, the, friuli, religious, strife, and, the, slavic, raids, remained, a, source, of, struggle, in, the, following, years, in, 705, the, friuli, lombards, were, defeated, and, lost, the, land, to, the, west, of, the, so, a, river, namely, the, gorizia, hills, and, the, venetian, slovenia, a, new, ethnic, border, was, established, that, has, lasted, for, over, 1200, years, up, until, the, present, time, the, lombard, reign, began, to, recover, only, with, liutprand, the, lombard, king, from, 712, son, of, ansprand, and, successor, of, the, brutal, aripert, ii, he, managed, to, regain, a, certain, control, over, spoleto, and, benevento, and, taking, advantage, of, the, disagreements, between, the, pope, and, byzantium, concerning, the, reverence, of, icons, he, annexed, the, exarchate, of, ravenna, and, the, duchy, of, rome, he, also, helped, the, frankish, marshal, charles, martel, drive, back, the, arabs, the, slavs, were, defeated, in, the, battle, of, lavariano, when, they, tried, to, conquer, the, friulian, plain, in, 720, liutprand, s, successor, aistulf, conquered, ravenna, for, the, lombards, for, the, first, time, but, had, to, relinquish, it, when, he, was, subsequently, defeated, by, the, king, of, the, franks, pippin, iii, who, was, called, by, the, pope, after, the, death, of, aistulf, ratchis, attempted, to, become, king, of, lombardy, but, he, was, deposed, by, desiderius, duke, of, tuscany, the, last, lombard, to, rule, as, king, desiderius, managed, to, take, ravenna, definitively, ending, the, byzantine, presence, in, northern, italy, he, decided, to, reopen, struggles, against, the, pope, who, was, supporting, the, dukes, of, spoleto, and, benevento, against, him, and, entered, rome, in, 772, the, first, lombard, king, to, do, so, but, when, pope, hadrian, i, called, for, help, from, the, powerful, frankish, king, charlemagne, desiderius, was, defeated, at, susa, and, besieged, in, pavia, while, his, son, adelchis, was, forced, to, open, the, gates, of, verona, to, frankish, troops, desiderius, surrendered, in, 774, and, charlemagne, in, an, utterly, novel, decision, took, the, title, king, of, the, lombards, before, then, the, germanic, kingdoms, had, frequently, conquered, each, other, but, none, had, adopted, the, title, of, king, of, another, people, charlemagne, took, part, of, the, lombard, territory, to, create, the, papal, states, the, lombardy, region, in, italy, which, includes, the, cities, of, brescia, bergamo, milan, and, the, old, capital, pavia, is, a, reminder, of, the, presence, of, the, lombards, though, the, kingdom, centred, on, pavia, in, the, north, fell, to, charlemagne, and, the, franks, in, 774, the, lombard, controlled, territory, to, the, south, of, the, papal, states, was, never, subjugated, by, charlemagne, or, his, descendants, in, 774, duke, arechis, ii, of, benevento, whose, duchy, had, only, nominally, been, under, royal, authority, though, certain, kings, had, been, effective, at, making, their, power, known, in, the, south, claimed, that, benevento, was, the, successor, state, of, the, kingdom, he, tried, to, turn, benevento, into, a, secundum, ticinum, a, second, pavia, he, tried, to, claim, the, kingship, but, with, no, support, and, no, chance, of, a, coronation, in, pavia, charlemagne, came, down, with, an, army, and, his, son, louis, the, pious, sent, men, to, force, the, beneventan, duke, to, submit, but, his, submission, and, promises, were, never, kept, and, arechis, and, his, successors, were, de, facto, independent, the, beneventan, dukes, took, the, title, pr, nceps, prince, instead, of, that, of, king, the, lombards, of, southern, italy, were, thereafter, in, the, anomalous, position, of, holding, land, claimed, by, two, empires, the, carolingian, empire, to, the, north, and, west, and, the, byzantine, empire, to, the, east, they, typically, made, pledges, and, promises, of, tribute, to, the, carolingians, but, effectively, remained, outside, frankish, control, benevento, meanwhile, grew, to, its, greatest, extent, yet, when, it, imposed, a, tribute, on, the, duchy, of, naples, which, was, tenuously, loyal, to, byzantium, and, even, conquered, the, neapolitan, city, of, amalfi, in, 838, at, one, point, in, the, reign, of, sicard, lombard, control, covered, most, of, southern, italy, save, the, very, south, of, apulia, and, calabria, and, naples, with, its, nominally, attached, cities, it, was, during, the, ninth, century, that, a, strong, lombard, presence, became, entrenched, in, formerly, greek, apulia, however, sicard, had, opened, up, the, south, to, the, invasive, actions, of, the, saracens, in, his, war, with, andrew, ii, of, naples, and, when, he, was, assassinated, in, 839, amalfi, declared, independence, and, two, factions, fought, for, power, in, benevento, crippling, the, principality, and, making, it, susceptible, to, external, enemies, the, civil, war, lasted, ten, years, and, ended, with, a, peace, treaty, imposed, in, 849, by, emperor, louis, ii, the, only, frankish, king, to, exercise, actual, sovereignty, over, the, lombard, states, the, treaty, divided, the, kingdom, into, two, states, the, principality, of, benevento, and, the, principality, of, salerno, with, its, capital, at, salerno, on, the, tyrrhenian, sea, andrew, ii, of, naples, hired, islamic, mercenaries, and, formed, a, muslim, christian, alliance, for, his, war, with, sicard, of, benevento, in, 836, sicard, responded, with, other, muslim, mercenaries, the, saracens, initially, concentrated, their, attacks, on, sicily, and, byzantine, italy, but, soon, radelchis, i, of, benevento, called, in, more, mercenaries, who, destroyed, capua, in, 841, landulf, the, old, founded, the, present, day, capua, new, capua, on, a, nearby, hill, in, general, the, lombard, princes, were, less, inclined, to, ally, with, the, saracens, than, with, their, greek, neighbours, of, amalfi, gaeta, naples, and, sorrento, guaifer, of, salerno, however, briefly, put, himself, under, muslim, suzerainty, in, 847, a, large, muslim, force, seized, bari, until, then, a, lombard, gastaldate, under, the, control, of, pandenulf, saracen, incursions, proceeded, northwards, until, adelchis, of, benevento, sought, the, help, of, his, suzerain, louis, ii, who, allied, with, the, byzantine, emperor, basil, i, to, expel, the, arabs, from, bari, in, 869, an, arab, landing, force, was, defeated, by, the, emperor, in, 871, adelchis, and, louis, remained, at, war, until, the, death, of, louis, in, 875, adelchis, regarded, himself, as, the, true, successor, of, the, lombard, kings, and, in, that, capacity, he, amended, the, edictum, rothari, the, last, lombard, ruler, to, do, so, after, the, death, of, louis, landulf, ii, of, capua, briefly, flirted, with, a, saracen, alliance, but, pope, john, viii, convinced, him, to, break, it, off, guaimar, i, of, salerno, fought, the, saracens, with, byzantine, troops, throughout, this, period, the, lombard, princes, swung, in, allegiance, from, one, party, to, another, finally, towards, 915, pope, john, x, managed, to, unite, the, christian, princes, of, southern, italy, against, the, saracen, establishments, on, the, garigliano, river, the, saracens, were, ousted, from, italy, in, the, battle, of, the, garigliano, in, 915, the, independent, state, of, salerno, inspired, the, gastalds, of, capua, to, move, towards, independence, and, by, the, end, of, the, century, they, were, styling, themselves, princes, and, as, a, third, lombard, state, the, capuan, and, beneventan, states, were, united, by, atenulf, i, of, capua, in, 900, he, subsequently, declared, them, to, be, in, perpetual, union, and, they, were, separated, only, in, 982, on, the, death, of, pandulf, ironhead, with, all, of, the, lombard, south, under, his, control, except, salerno, atenulf, felt, safe, to, use, the, title, princeps, gentis, langobardorum, prince, of, the, lombard, people, which, arechis, ii, had, begun, using, in, 774, among, atenulf, s, successors, the, principality, was, ruled, jointly, by, fathers, sons, brothers, cousins, and, uncles, for, the, greater, part, of, the, century, meanwhile, the, prince, gisulf, i, of, salerno, began, using, the, title, langobardorum, gentis, princeps, around, mid, century, but, the, ideal, of, a, united, lombard, principality, was, realised, only, in, december, 977, when, gisulf, died, and, his, domains, were, inherited, by, pandulf, ironhead, who, temporarily, held, almost, all, italy, south, of, rome, and, brought, the, lombards, into, an, alliance, with, the, holy, roman, empire, his, territories, were, divided, upon, his, death, landulf, the, red, of, benevento, and, capua, tried, to, conquer, the, principality, of, salerno, with, the, help, of, john, iii, of, naples, but, with, the, aid, of, mastalus, i, of, amalfi, gisulf, repulsed, him, the, rulers, of, benevento, and, capua, made, several, attempts, on, byzantine, apulia, at, this, time, but, late, in, the, century, the, byzantines, under, the, stiff, rule, of, basil, ii, gained, ground, on, the, lombards, the, principal, source, for, the, history, of, the, lombard, principalities, in, this, period, is, the, chronicon, salernitanum, composed, late, in, the, tenth, century, at, salerno, the, diminished, beneventan, principality, soon, lost, its, independence, to, the, papacy, and, declined, in, importance, until, it, fell, in, the, norman, conquest, of, southern, italy, the, normans, first, called, in, by, the, lombards, to, fight, the, byzantines, for, control, of, apulia, and, calabria, under, the, likes, of, melus, of, bari, and, arduin, among, others, had, become, rivals, for, hegemony, in, the, south, the, salernitan, principality, experienced, a, golden, age, under, guaimar, iii, and, guaimar, iv, but, under, gisulf, ii, the, principality, shrank, to, insignificance, and, fell, in, 1078, to, robert, guiscard, who, had, married, gisulf, s, sister, sichelgaita, the, capua, principality, was, hotly, contested, during, the, reign, of, the, hated, pandulf, iv, the, wolf, of, the, abruzzi, and, under, his, son, it, fell, almost, without, contest, to, the, norman, richard, drengot, 1058, the, capuans, revolted, against, norman, rule, in, 1091, expelling, richard, s, grandson, richard, ii, and, setting, up, one, lando, iv, capua, was, again, put, under, norman, rule, after, the, siege, of, capua, of, 1098, and, the, city, quickly, declined, in, importance, under, a, series, of, ineffective, norman, rulers, the, independent, status, of, these, lombard, states, is, in, general, attested, by, the, ability, of, their, rulers, to, switch, suzerains, at, will, often, the, legal, vassal, of, the, pope, or, the, emperor, either, byzantine, or, holy, roman, they, were, the, real, power, brokers, in, the, south, until, their, erstwhile, allies, the, normans, rose, to, preeminence, a, genetic, study, published, in, nature, communications, in, september, 2018, found, strong, genetic, similarities, between, lombards, of, italy, and, earlier, lombards, of, central, europe, lombard, males, were, primarily, carriers, of, subclades, of, haplogroup, r1b, and, i2a2a1, both, of, which, are, common, among, germanic, peoples, lombard, males, were, found, to, be, more, genetically, homogeneous, than, lombard, females, the, evidence, suggested, that, the, lombards, originated, in, central, northern, europe, and, were, a, patriarchal, people, who, settled, central, europe, and, then, later, italy, through, a, migration, from, the, north, a, genetic, study, published, in, science, advances, in, september, 2018, examined, the, remains, of, a, lombard, male, buried, at, an, alemannic, graveyard, he, was, found, to, be, a, carrier, of, the, paternal, haplogroup, r1b1a2a1a1c2b2b, and, the, maternal, haplogroup, h65a, the, graveyard, also, included, the, remains, of, a, frankish, and, a, byzantine, male, both, of, whom, were, also, carriers, of, subclades, of, the, paternal, haplogroup, r1b1a2a1a1, the, lombard, frankish, and, byzantine, males, were, all, found, to, be, closely, related, and, displayed, close, genetic, links, to, northern, europe, particularly, lithuania, and, iceland, a, genetic, study, published, in, the, european, journal, of, human, genetics, in, january, 2019, examined, the, mtdna, of, a, large, number, of, early, medieval, lombard, remains, from, central, europe, and, italy, these, individuals, were, found, to, be, closely, related, and, displayed, strong, genetic, links, to, central, europe, the, evidence, suggested, that, the, lombard, settlement, of, italy, was, the, result, of, a, migration, from, the, north, involving, both, males, and, females, the, lombardic, language, is, extinct, unless, cimbrian, and, m, cheno, represent, surviving, dialects, it, declined, beginning, in, the, seventh, century, but, may, have, been, in, scattered, use, until, as, late, as, about, the, year, 1000, only, fragments, of, the, language, have, survived, the, main, evidence, being, individual, words, quoted, in, latin, texts, in, the, absence, of, lombardic, texts, it, is, not, possible, to, draw, any, conclusions, about, the, language, s, morphology, and, syntax, the, genetic, classification, of, the, language, depends, entirely, on, phonology, since, there, is, evidence, that, lombardic, participated, in, and, indeed, shows, some, of, the, earliest, evidence, for, the, high, german, consonant, shift, it, is, usually, classified, as, an, elbe, germanic, or, upper, german, dialect, lombardic, fragments, are, preserved, in, runic, inscriptions, primary, source, texts, include, short, inscriptions, in, the, elder, futhark, among, them, the, bronze, capsule, of, schretzheim, c, 600, and, the, silver, belt, buckle, found, in, pforzen, ostallg, u, schwaben, a, number, of, latin, texts, include, lombardic, names, and, lombardic, legal, texts, contain, terms, taken, from, the, legal, vocabulary, of, the, vernacular, in, 2005, emilia, den, eva, argued, that, the, inscription, of, the, pernik, sword, may, be, lombardic, the, italian, language, preserves, a, large, number, of, lombardic, words, although, it, is, not, always, easy, to, distinguish, them, from, other, germanic, borrowings, such, as, those, from, gothic, or, from, frankish, they, often, bear, some, resemblance, to, english, words, as, lombardic, was, akin, to, old, saxon, for, instance, landa, from, land, guardia, from, wardan, warden, guerra, from, werra, war, ricco, from, rikki, rich, and, guadare, from, wadjan, to, wade, the, codice, diplomatico, longobardo, a, collection, of, legal, documents, makes, reference, to, many, lombardic, terms, some, of, them, still, in, use, in, the,

great, migration, kingship, developed, among, the, germanic, peoples, when, the, unity, of, a, single, military, command, was, found, necessary, schmidt, believed, that, the, germanic, tribes, were, divided, into, cantons, and, that, the, earliest, government, was, a, general, assembly, that, selected, canton, chiefs, and, war, leaders, in, times, of, conflict, all, such, figures, were, probably, selected, from, a, caste, of, nobility, as, a, result, of, the, wars, of, their, wanderings, royal, power, developed, such, that, the, king, became, the, representative, of, the, people, but, the, influence, of, the, people, on, the, government, did, not, fully, disappear, paul, the, deacon, gives, an, account, of, the, lombard, tribal, structure, during, the, migration, in, order, that, they, might, increase, the, number, of, their, warriors, confer, liberty, upon, many, whom, they, deliver, from, the, yoke, of, bondage, and, that, the, freedom, of, these, may, be, regarded, as, established, they, confirm, it, in, their, accustomed, way, by, an, arrow, uttering, certain, words, of, their, country, in, confirmation, of, the, fact, complete, emancipation, appears, to, have, been, granted, only, among, the, franks, and, the, lombards, lombard, society, was, divided, into, classes, comparable, to, those, found, in, the, other, germanic, successor, states, of, rome, frankish, gaul, and, spain, under, the, visigoths, there, was, a, noble, class, a, class, of, free, persons, beneath, them, a, class, of, unfree, non, slaves, serfs, and, finally, slaves, the, aristocracy, itself, was, poorer, more, urbanised, and, less, landed, than, elsewhere, aside, from, the, richest, and, most, powerful, of, the, dukes, and, the, king, himself, lombard, noblemen, tended, to, live, in, cities, unlike, their, frankish, counterparts, and, hold, little, more, than, twice, as, much, in, land, as, the, merchant, class, a, far, cry, from, provincial, frankish, aristocrats, who, held, vast, swathes, of, land, hundreds, of, times, larger, than, those, beneath, his, status, the, aristocracy, by, the, eighth, century, was, highly, dependent, on, the, king, for, means, of, income, related, especially, to, judicial, duties, many, lombard, nobles, are, referred, to, in, contemporary, documents, as, iudices, judges, even, when, their, offices, had, important, military, and, legislative, functions, as, well, the, freemen, of, the, lombard, kingdom, were, far, more, numerous, than, in, frankish, lands, especially, in, the, eighth, century, when, they, are, almost, invisible, in, surviving, documentary, evidence, smallholders, owner, cultivators, and, rentiers, are, the, most, numerous, types, of, person, in, surviving, diplomata, for, the, lombard, kingdom, they, may, have, owned, more, than, half, of, the, land, in, lombard, italy, the, freemen, were, exercitales, and, viri, devoti, that, is, soldiers, and, devoted, men, a, military, term, like, retainers, they, formed, the, levy, of, the, lombard, army, and, they, were, sometimes, if, infrequently, called, to, serve, though, this, seems, not, to, have, been, their, preference, the, small, landed, class, however, lacked, the, political, influence, necessary, with, the, king, and, the, dukes, to, control, the, politics, and, legislation, of, the, kingdom, the, aristocracy, was, more, thoroughly, powerful, politically, if, not, economically, in, italy, than, in, contemporary, gaul, and, spain, the, urbanisation, of, lombard, italy, was, characterised, by, the, citt, ad, isole, or, city, as, islands, it, appears, from, archaeology, that, the, great, cities, of, lombard, italy, pavia, lucca, siena, arezzo, milan, were, themselves, formed, of, small, urban, cores, within, the, old, roman, city, walls, the, cities, of, the, roman, empire, had, been, partially, destroyed, in, the, series, of, wars, of, the, fifth, and, sixth, centuries, many, sectors, were, left, in, ruins, and, ancient, monuments, became, fields, of, grass, used, as, pastures, for, animals, thus, the, roman, forum, became, the, campo, vaccino, the, field, of, cows, the, portions, of, the, cities, that, remained, intact, were, small, modest, contained, a, cathedral, or, major, church, often, sumptuously, decorated, and, a, few, public, buildings, and, townhouses, of, the, aristocracy, few, buildings, of, importance, were, stone, most, were, wood, in, the, end, the, inhabited, parts, of, the, cities, were, separated, from, one, another, by, stretches, of, pasture, even, within, the, city, walls, the, legend, from, origo, may, hint, that, initially, before, the, passage, from, scandinavia, to, the, southern, coast, of, the, baltic, sea, the, lombards, worshiped, the, vanir, later, in, contact, with, other, germanic, populations, they, adopted, the, worship, of, the, sir, an, evolution, that, marked, the, passage, from, the, adoration, of, deities, related, to, fertility, and, the, earth, to, the, cult, of, warlike, gods, in, chapter, 40, of, his, germania, roman, historian, tacitus, discussing, the, suebian, tribes, of, germania, writes, that, the, lombards, were, one, of, the, suebian, tribes, united, in, worship, of, the, deity, nerthus, who, is, often, identified, with, the, norse, goddess, freyja, the, other, tribes, were, the, reudigni, aviones, anglii, varini, eudoses, suarines, and, nuitones, st, barbatus, of, benevento, observed, many, pagan, rituals, and, traditions, among, the, lombards, authorised, by, the, duke, romuald, son, of, king, grimoald, they, expressed, a, religious, veneration, to, a, golden, viper, and, prostrated, themselves, before, it, they, paid, also, a, superstitious, honour, to, a, tree, on, which, they, hung, the, skin, of, a, wild, beast, and, these, ceremonies, were, closed, by, public, games, in, which, the, skin, served, for, a, mark, at, which, bowmen, shot, arrows, over, their, shoulder, the, lombards, first, adopted, christianity, while, still, in, pannonia, but, their, conversion, and, christianisation, was, largely, nominal, and, far, from, complete, during, the, reign, of, wacho, they, were, orthodox, catholics, allied, with, the, byzantine, empire, but, alboin, converted, to, arianism, as, an, ally, of, the, ostrogoths, and, invaded, italy, all, these, christian, conversions, primarily, affected, the, aristocracy, while, the, common, people, remained, pagan, in, italy, the, lombards, were, intensively, christianised, and, the, pressure, to, convert, to, orthodox, catholicism, was, great, with, the, bavarian, queen, theodelinda, an, orthodox, catholic, the, monarchy, was, brought, under, heavy, catholic, influence, after, initial, support, for, the, anti, rome, party, in, the, schism, of, the, three, chapters, theodelinda, remained, a, close, contact, and, supporter, of, pope, gregory, i, in, 603, adaloald, the, heir, to, the, throne, received, orthodox, catholic, baptism, however, the, lack, of, spiritual, involvement, of, most, of, the, lombards, in, religious, disputes, remained, constant, so, much, so, that, the, opposition, between, orthodox, catholics, on, the, one, hand, and, pagans, arians, and, schismatics, on, the, other, soon, took, on, political, significance, the, supporters, of, roman, orthodoxy, led, by, the, bavarian, dynasty, were, politically, the, proponents, of, greater, integration, with, the, romans, accompanied, by, a, strategy, of, preserving, the, status, quo, with, the, byzantines, arians, pagans, and, schismatics, rooted, above, all, in, the, northeastern, regions, of, the, kingdom, austria, were, instead, interpreters, of, the, preservation, of, the, warlike, and, aggressive, spirit, of, the, people, thus, to, the, pro, catholic, phase, of, agilulf, theodolinda, and, adaloald, followed, from, 626, arioald, s, accession, to, the, throne, to, 690, definitive, defeat, of, the, rebel, alahis, a, long, phase, of, the, revival, of, arianism, embodied, by, militarily, aggressive, kings, like, rothari, and, grimoald, however, tolerance, towards, orthodox, catholics, was, never, questioned, by, the, various, kings, also, safeguarded, by, the, influential, contribution, of, the, respective, queens, largely, chosen, for, reasons, of, dynastic, legitimacy, among, the, orthodox, catholic, princesses, of, the, bavarian, dynasty, in, the, seventh, century, the, nominally, christian, aristocracy, of, benevento, was, still, practising, pagan, rituals, such, as, sacrifices, in, sacred, woods, by, the, end, of, the, reign, of, cunincpert, however, the, lombards, were, more, or, less, completely, catholicised, under, liutprand, orthodox, catholicism, became, tangible, as, the, king, sought, to, justify, his, title, rex, totius, italiae, by, uniting, the, south, of, the, peninsula, with, the, north, thereby, bringing, together, his, italo, roman, and, germanic, subjects, into, one, catholic, state, the, duchy, and, eventually, principality, of, benevento, in, southern, italy, developed, a, unique, christian, rite, in, the, seventh, and, eighth, centuries, the, beneventan, rite, is, more, closely, related, to, the, liturgy, of, the, ambrosian, rite, than, to, the, roman, rite, the, beneventan, rite, has, not, survived, in, its, complete, form, although, most, of, the, principal, feasts, and, several, feasts, of, local, significance, are, extant, the, beneventan, rite, appears, to, have, been, less, complete, less, systematic, and, more, liturgically, flexible, than, the, roman, rite, characteristic, of, this, rite, was, the, beneventan, chant, a, lombard, influenced, chant, that, bore, similarities, to, the, ambrosian, chant, of, milan, the, beneventan, chant, is, largely, defined, by, its, role, in, the, liturgy, of, the, beneventan, rite, many, beneventan, chants, were, assigned, multiple, roles, when, inserted, into, gregorian, chantbooks, appearing, variously, as, antiphons, offertories, and, communions, for, example, it, was, eventually, supplanted, by, the, gregorian, chant, in, the, eleventh, century, the, chief, centre, of, the, beneventan, chant, was, montecassino, one, of, the, first, and, greatest, abbeys, of, western, monasticism, gisulf, ii, of, benevento, had, donated, a, large, swathe, of, land, to, montecassino, in, 744, and, that, became, the, basis, for, an, important, state, the, terra, sancti, benedicti, which, was, a, subject, only, to, rome, the, cassinese, influence, on, christianity, in, southern, italy, was, immense, montecassino, was, also, the, starting, point, for, another, characteristic, of, beneventan, monasticism, the, use, of, the, distinct, beneventan, script, a, clear, angular, script, derived, from, the, roman, cursive, as, used, by, the, lombards, during, their, nomadic, phase, the, lombards, primarily, created, art, that, was, easily, carried, with, them, like, arms, and, jewellery, though, relatively, little, of, this, has, survived, it, bears, resemblance, to, the, similar, endeavours, of, other, germanic, tribes, of, central, europe, from, the, same, era, the, first, major, modifications, to, the, germanic, style, of, the, lombards, came, in, pannonia, and, especially, in, italy, under, the, influence, of, local, byzantine, and, christian, styles, the, conversions, from, nomadism, and, paganism, to, settlement, and, christianity, also, opened, up, new, arenas, of, artistic, expressions, such, as, architecture, especially, churches, and, its, accompanying, decorative, arts, such, as, frescoes, few, lombard, buildings, have, survived, most, have, been, lost, rebuilt, or, renovated, at, some, point, so, they, preserve, little, of, their, original, lombard, structure, lombard, architecture, was, well, studied, in, the, twentieth, century, and, the, four, volume, lombard, architecture, 1919, by, arthur, kingsley, porter, is, a, monument, of, illustrated, history, the, small, oratorio, di, santa, maria, in, valle, in, cividale, del, friuli, is, probably, one, of, the, oldest, preserved, examples, of, lombard, architecture, as, cividale, was, the, first, lombard, city, in, italy, parts, of, lombard, constructions, have, been, preserved, in, pavia, san, pietro, in, ciel, d, oro, crypts, of, sant, eusebio, and, san, giovanni, domnarum, and, monza, cathedral, the, basilic, autariana, in, fara, gera, d, adda, near, bergamo, and, the, church, of, san, salvatore, in, brescia, also, have, lombard, elements, all, these, buildings, are, in, northern, italy, langobardia, major, but, by, far, the, best, preserved, lombard, structure, is, in, southern, italy, langobardia, minor, the, church, of, santa, sofia, in, benevento, was, erected, in, 760, by, duke, arechis, ii, and, it, preserves, lombard, frescoes, on, the, walls, and, even, lombard, capitals, on, the, columns, lombard, architecture, flourished, under, the, impulse, provided, by, the, catholic, monarchs, like, theodelinda, liutprand, and, desiderius, to, the, foundation, of, monasteries, to, further, their, political, control, bobbio, abbey, was, founded, during, this, time, some, of, the, late, lombard, structures, of, the, ninth, and, tenth, centuries, have, been, found, to, contain, elements, of, style, associated, with, romanesque, architecture, and, so, have, been, dubbed, first, romanesque, these, edifices, are, considered, along, with, some, similar, buildings, in, southern, france, and, catalonia, to, mark, a, transitory, phase, between, the, pre, romanesque, and, full, fledged, romanesque, ancient, sources, modern, sources
