https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serfdom
serfdom, was, the, status, of, many, peasants, under, feudalism, specifically, relating, to, manorialism, and, similar, systems, it, was, a, condition, of, debt, bondage, and, indentured, servitude, with, similarities, to, and, differences, from, slavery, it, developed, during, late, antiquity, and, the, early, middle, ages, in, europe, and, lasted, in, some, countries, until, the, mid, 19th, century, unlike, slaves, serfs, could, not, be, bought, sold, or, traded, individually, though, they, could, depending, on, the, area, be, sold, together, with, land, actual, slaves, such, as, the, kholops, in, russia, could, by, contrast, be, traded, like, regular, slaves, could, be, abused, with, no, rights, over, their, own, bodies, could, not, leave, the, land, they, were, bound, to, and, could, marry, only, with, their, lord, s, permission, serfs, who, occupied, a, plot, of, land, were, required, to, work, for, the, lord, of, the, manor, who, owned, that, land, in, return, they, were, entitled, to, protection, justice, and, the, right, to, cultivate, certain, fields, within, the, manor, to, maintain, their, own, subsistence, serfs, were, often, required, not, only, to, work, on, the, lord, s, fields, but, also, in, his, mines, and, forests, and, to, labour, to, maintain, roads, the, manor, formed, the, basic, unit, of, feudal, society, and, the, lord, of, the, manor, and, the, villeins, and, to, a, certain, extent, the, serfs, were, bound, legally, by, taxation, in, the, case, of, the, former, and, economically, and, socially, in, the, latter, the, decline, of, serfdom, in, western, europe, has, sometimes, been, attributed, to, the, widespread, plague, epidemic, of, the, black, death, which, reached, europe, in, 1347, and, caused, massive, fatalities, disrupting, society, conversely, serfdom, grew, stronger, in, central, and, eastern, europe, where, it, had, previously, been, less, common, this, phenomenon, was, known, as, second, serfdom, in, eastern, europe, the, institution, persisted, until, the, mid, 19th, century, in, russia, serfdom, gradually, evolved, from, the, usual, european, form, to, become, de, facto, slavery, though, it, continued, to, be, called, serfdom, in, the, austrian, empire, serfdom, was, abolished, by, the, 1781, serfdom, patent, corv, es, continued, to, exist, until, 1848, serfdom, was, abolished, in, russia, in, 1861, prussia, declared, serfdom, unacceptable, in, its, general, state, laws, for, the, prussian, states, in, 1792, and, finally, abolished, it, in, october, 1807, in, the, wake, of, the, prussian, reform, movement, in, finland, norway, and, sweden, feudalism, was, never, fully, established, and, serfdom, did, not, exist, in, denmark, serfdom, like, institutions, did, exist, in, both, stavn, s, the, stavnsb, nd, from, 1733, to, 1788, and, its, vassal, iceland, the, more, restrictive, vistarband, from, 1490, until, 1894, according, to, medievalist, historian, joseph, r, strayer, the, concept, of, feudalism, can, also, be, applied, to, the, societies, of, ancient, persia, ancient, mesopotamia, egypt, from, the, late, old, kingdom, through, the, middle, kingdom, sixth, to, twelfth, dynasty, islamic, ruled, northern, and, central, india, china, zhou, dynasty, and, end, of, han, dynasty, and, japan, during, the, shogunate, wu, ta, k, un, argued, that, the, shang, zhou, fengjian, were, kinship, estates, quite, distinct, from, feudalism, james, lee, and, cameron, campbell, describe, the, chinese, qing, dynasty, 1644, 1912, as, also, maintaining, a, form, of, serfdom, melvyn, goldstein, described, tibet, as, having, had, serfdom, until, 1959, but, whether, or, not, the, tibetan, form, of, peasant, tenancy, that, qualified, as, serfdom, was, widespread, is, contested, by, other, scholars, bhutan, is, described, by, tashi, wangchuk, a, bhutanese, civil, servant, as, having, officially, abolished, serfdom, by, 1959, but, he, believes, that, less, than, or, about, 10, of, poor, peasants, were, in, copyhold, situations, the, united, nations, 1956, supplementary, convention, on, the, abolition, of, slavery, also, prohibits, serfdom, as, a, practice, similar, to, slavery, social, institutions, similar, to, serfdom, were, known, in, ancient, times, the, status, of, the, helots, in, the, ancient, greek, city, state, of, sparta, resembled, that, of, the, medieval, serfs, by, the, 3rd, century, ad, the, roman, empire, faced, a, labour, shortage, large, roman, landowners, increasingly, relied, on, roman, freemen, acting, as, tenant, farmers, instead, of, slaves, to, provide, labour, these, tenant, farmers, eventually, known, as, coloni, saw, their, condition, steadily, erode, because, the, tax, system, implemented, by, diocletian, assessed, taxes, based, on, both, land, and, the, inhabitants, of, that, land, it, became, administratively, inconvenient, for, peasants, to, leave, the, land, where, they, were, counted, in, the, census, medieval, serfdom, really, began, with, the, breakup, of, the, carolingian, empire, around, the, 10th, century, during, this, period, powerful, feudal, lords, encouraged, the, establishment, of, serfdom, as, a, source, of, agricultural, labour, serfdom, indeed, was, an, institution, that, reflected, a, fairly, common, practice, whereby, great, landlords, were, assured, that, others, worked, to, feed, them, and, were, held, down, legally, and, economically, while, doing, so, this, arrangement, provided, most, of, the, agricultural, labour, throughout, the, middle, ages, slavery, persisted, right, through, the, middle, ages, but, it, was, rare, in, the, later, middle, ages, serfdom, began, to, disappear, west, of, the, rhine, even, as, it, spread, through, eastern, europe, serfdom, reached, eastern, europe, centuries, later, than, western, europe, it, became, dominant, around, the, 15th, century, in, many, of, these, countries, serfdom, was, abolished, during, the, napoleonic, invasions, of, the, early, 19th, century, though, in, some, it, persisted, until, mid, or, late, 19th, century, the, word, serf, originated, from, the, middle, french, serf, and, was, derived, from, the, latin, servus, slave, in, late, antiquity, and, most, of, the, middle, ages, what, are, now, called, serfs, were, usually, designated, in, latin, as, coloni, as, slavery, gradually, disappeared, and, the, legal, status, of, servi, became, nearly, identical, to, that, of, the, coloni, the, term, changed, meaning, into, the, modern, concept, of, serf, the, word, serf, is, first, recorded, in, english, in, the, late, 15th, century, and, came, to, its, current, definition, in, the, 17th, century, serfdom, was, coined, in, 1850, serfs, had, a, specific, place, in, feudal, society, as, did, barons, and, knights, in, return, for, protection, a, serf, would, reside, upon, and, work, a, parcel, of, land, within, the, manor, of, his, lord, thus, the, manorial, system, exhibited, a, degree, of, reciprocity, one, rationale, held, that, serfs, and, freemen, worked, for, all, while, a, knight, or, baron, fought, for, all, and, a, churchman, prayed, for, all, thus, everyone, had, a, place, the, serf, was, the, worst, fed, and, rewarded, however, although, unlike, slaves, had, certain, rights, in, land, and, property, a, lord, of, the, manor, could, not, sell, his, serfs, as, a, roman, might, sell, his, slaves, on, the, other, hand, if, he, chose, to, dispose, of, a, parcel, of, land, the, serfs, associated, with, that, land, stayed, with, it, to, serve, their, new, lord, simply, speaking, they, were, implicitly, sold, in, mass, and, as, a, part, of, a, lot, this, unified, system, preserved, for, the, lord, long, acquired, knowledge, of, practices, suited, to, the, land, further, a, serf, could, not, abandon, his, lands, without, permission, nor, did, he, possess, a, saleable, title, in, them, a, freeman, became, a, serf, usually, through, force, or, necessity, sometimes, the, greater, physical, and, legal, force, of, a, local, magnate, intimidated, freeholders, or, allodial, owners, into, dependency, often, a, few, years, of, crop, failure, a, war, or, brigandage, might, leave, a, person, unable, to, make, his, own, way, in, such, a, case, he, could, strike, a, bargain, with, a, lord, of, a, manor, in, exchange, for, gaining, protection, his, service, was, required, in, labour, produce, or, cash, or, a, combination, of, all, these, bargains, became, formalised, in, a, ceremony, known, as, bondage, in, which, a, serf, placed, his, head, in, the, lord, s, hands, akin, to, the, ceremony, of, homage, where, a, vassal, placed, his, hands, between, those, of, his, overlord, these, oaths, bound, the, lord, and, his, new, serf, in, a, feudal, contract, and, defined, the, terms, of, their, agreement, often, these, bargains, were, severe, a, 7th, century, anglo, saxon, oath, of, fealty, states, by, the, lord, before, whom, this, sanctuary, is, holy, i, will, to, n, be, true, and, faithful, and, love, all, which, he, loves, and, shun, all, which, he, shuns, according, to, the, laws, of, god, and, the, order, of, the, world, nor, will, i, ever, with, will, or, action, through, word, or, deed, do, anything, which, is, unpleasing, to, him, on, condition, that, he, will, hold, to, me, as, i, shall, deserve, it, and, that, he, will, perform, everything, as, it, was, in, our, agreement, when, i, submitted, myself, to, him, and, chose, his, will, to, become, a, serf, was, a, commitment, that, encompassed, all, aspects, of, the, serf, s, life, the, children, born, to, serfs, inherited, their, status, and, were, considered, born, into, serfdom, by, taking, on, the, duties, of, serfdom, people, bound, themselves, and, their, progeny, the, social, class, of, the, peasantry, can, be, differentiated, into, smaller, categories, these, distinctions, were, often, less, clear, than, suggested, by, their, different, names, most, often, there, were, two, types, of, peasants, lower, classes, of, peasants, known, as, cottars, or, bordars, generally, comprising, the, younger, sons, of, villeins, vagabonds, and, slaves, made, up, the, lower, class, of, workers, the, colonus, system, of, the, late, roman, empire, can, be, considered, the, predecessor, of, western, european, feudal, serfdom, freemen, or, free, tenants, held, their, land, by, one, of, a, variety, of, contracts, of, feudal, land, tenure, and, were, essentially, rent, paying, tenant, farmers, who, owed, little, or, no, service, to, the, lord, and, had, a, good, degree, of, security, of, tenure, and, independence, in, parts, of, 11th, century, england, freemen, made, up, only, 10, of, the, peasant, population, and, in, most, of, the, rest, of, europe, their, numbers, were, also, small, ministeriales, were, hereditary, unfree, knights, tied, to, their, lord, that, formed, the, lowest, rung, of, nobility, in, the, holy, roman, empire, a, villein, or, villain, represented, the, most, common, type, of, serf, in, the, middle, ages, villeins, had, more, rights, and, higher, status, than, the, lowest, serf, but, existed, under, a, number, of, legal, restrictions, that, differentiated, them, from, freemen, villeins, generally, rented, small, homes, with, a, patch, of, land, as, part, of, the, contract, with, the, landlord, the, lord, of, the, manor, they, were, expected, to, spend, some, of, their, time, working, on, the, lord, s, fields, the, rest, of, their, time, was, spent, farming, their, own, land, for, their, own, profit, villeins, were, tied, to, their, lord, s, land, and, could, not, leave, it, without, his, permission, their, lord, also, often, decided, whom, they, could, marry, like, other, types, of, serfs, villeins, had, to, provide, other, services, possibly, in, addition, to, paying, rent, of, money, or, produce, villeins, could, not, move, away, without, their, lord, s, consent, and, the, acceptance, of, the, lord, to, whose, manor, they, proposed, to, migrate, to, villeins, were, generally, able, to, hold, their, own, property, unlike, slaves, villeinage, as, opposed, to, other, forms, of, serfdom, was, most, common, in, continental, european, feudalism, where, land, ownership, had, developed, from, roots, in, roman, law, a, variety, of, kinds, of, villeinage, existed, in, europe, in, the, middle, ages, half, villeins, received, only, half, as, many, strips, of, land, for, their, own, use, and, owed, a, full, complement, of, labour, to, the, lord, often, forcing, them, to, rent, out, their, services, to, other, serfs, to, make, up, for, this, hardship, villeinage, was, not, a, purely, uni, directional, exploitative, relationship, in, the, middle, ages, land, within, a, lord, s, manor, provided, sustenance, and, survival, and, being, a, villein, guaranteed, access, to, land, and, crops, secure, from, theft, by, marauding, robbers, landlords, even, were, legally, entitled, to, do, so, rarely, evicted, villeins, because, of, the, value, of, their, labour, villeinage, was, much, preferable, to, being, a, vagabond, a, slave, or, an, unlanded, labourer, in, many, medieval, countries, a, villein, could, gain, freedom, by, escaping, from, a, manor, to, a, city, or, borough, and, living, there, for, more, than, a, year, but, this, action, involved, the, loss, of, land, rights, and, agricultural, livelihood, a, prohibitive, price, unless, the, landlord, was, especially, tyrannical, or, conditions, in, the, village, were, unusually, difficult, in, medieval, england, two, types, of, villeins, existed, villeins, regardant, that, were, tied, to, land, and, villeins, in, gross, that, could, be, traded, separately, from, land, in, england, the, domesday, book, of, 1086, uses, bordarii, bordar, and, cottarii, cottar, as, interchangeable, terms, cottar, deriving, from, the, native, anglo, saxon, tongue, whereas, bordar, derived, from, the, french, status, wise, the, bordar, or, cottar, ranked, below, a, serf, in, the, social, hierarchy, of, a, manor, holding, a, cottage, garden, and, just, enough, land, to, feed, a, family, in, england, at, the, time, of, the, domesday, survey, this, would, have, comprised, between, about, 1, and, 5, acres, 0, 4, and, 2, 0, hectares, under, an, elizabethan, statute, the, erection, of, cottages, act, 1588, the, cottage, had, to, be, built, with, at, least, 4, acres, 0, 02, km, 2, 0, 01, sq, mi, of, land, the, later, enclosures, acts, 1604, onwards, removed, the, cottars, right, to, any, land, before, the, enclosures, act, the, cottager, was, a, farm, labourer, with, land, and, after, the, enclosures, act, the, cottager, was, a, farm, labourer, without, land, the, bordars, and, cottars, did, not, own, their, draught, oxen, or, horses, the, domesday, book, showed, that, england, comprised, 12, freeholders, 35, serfs, or, villeins, 30, cotters, and, bordars, and, 9, slaves, smerdy, were, a, type, of, serfs, above, kholops, in, medieval, poland, and, kievan, rus, kholops, were, the, lowest, class, of, serfs, in, the, medieval, and, early, modern, russia, they, had, status, similar, to, slaves, and, could, be, freely, traded, the, last, type, of, serf, was, the, slave, slaves, had, the, fewest, rights, and, benefits, from, the, manor, they, owned, no, tenancy, in, land, worked, for, the, lord, exclusively, and, survived, on, donations, from, the, landlord, it, was, always, in, the, interest, of, the, lord, to, prove, that, a, servile, arrangement, existed, as, this, provided, him, with, greater, rights, to, fees, and, taxes, the, status, of, a, man, was, a, primary, issue, in, determining, a, person, s, rights, and, obligations, in, many, of, the, manorial, court, cases, of, the, period, also, runaway, slaves, could, be, beaten, if, caught, serfdom, was, significantly, more, common, than, slavery, throughout, the, feudal, period, the, villein, was, the, most, common, type, of, serf, in, the, middle, ages, villeins, had, more, rights, and, status, than, those, held, as, slaves, but, were, under, a, number, of, legal, restrictions, that, differentiated, them, from, the, freeman, within, his, constraints, a, serf, had, some, freedom, though, the, common, wisdom, is, that, a, serf, owned, only, his, belly, even, his, clothes, were, the, property, in, law, of, his, lord, a, serf, might, still, accumulate, personal, property, and, wealth, and, some, serfs, became, wealthier, than, their, free, neighbors, although, this, was, rather, an, exception, to, the, general, rule, a, well, to, do, serf, might, even, be, able, to, buy, his, freedom, the, usual, serf, not, including, slaves, or, cottars, paid, his, fees, and, taxes, in, the, form, of, seasonally, appropriate, labour, usually, a, portion, of, the, week, was, devoted, to, ploughing, his, lord, s, fields, held, in, demesne, harvesting, crops, digging, ditches, repairing, fences, and, often, working, in, the, manor, house, the, remainder, of, the, serf, s, time, was, spent, tending, his, own, fields, crops, and, animals, in, order, to, provide, for, his, family, most, manorial, work, was, segregated, by, gender, during, the, regular, times, of, the, year, during, the, harvest, the, whole, family, was, expected, to, work, the, fields, a, major, difficulty, of, a, serf, s, life, was, that, his, work, for, his, lord, coincided, with, and, took, precedence, over, the, work, he, had, to, perform, on, his, own, lands, when, the, lord, s, crops, were, ready, to, be, harvested, so, were, his, own, on, the, other, hand, the, serf, of, a, benign, lord, could, look, forward, to, being, well, fed, during, his, service, it, was, a, lord, without, foresight, who, did, not, provide, a, substantial, meal, for, his, serfs, during, the, harvest, and, planting, times, in, exchange, for, this, work, on, the, lord, s, demesne, the, serfs, had, certain, privileges, and, rights, including, for, example, the, right, to, gather, deadwood, an, essential, source, of, fuel, from, their, lord, s, forests, in, addition, to, service, a, serf, was, required, to, pay, certain, taxes, and, fees, taxes, were, based, on, the, assessed, value, of, his, lands, and, holdings, fees, were, usually, paid, in, the, form, of, agricultural, produce, rather, than, cash, the, best, ration, of, wheat, from, the, serf, s, harvest, often, went, to, the, landlord, generally, hunting, and, trapping, of, wild, game, by, the, serfs, on, the, lord, s, property, was, prohibited, on, easter, sunday, the, peasant, family, perhaps, might, owe, an, extra, dozen, eggs, and, at, christmas, a, goose, was, perhaps, required, too, when, a, family, member, died, extra, taxes, were, paid, to, the, lord, as, a, form, of, feudal, relief, to, enable, the, heir, to, keep, the, right, to, till, what, land, he, had, any, young, woman, who, wished, to, marry, a, serf, outside, of, her, manor, was, forced, to, pay, a, fee, for, the, right, to, leave, her, lord, and, in, compensation, for, her, lost, labour, often, there, were, arbitrary, tests, to, judge, the, worthiness, of, their, tax, payments, a, chicken, for, example, might, be, required, to, be, able, to, jump, over, a, fence, of, a, given, height, to, be, considered, old, enough, or, well, enough, to, be, valued, for, tax, purposes, the, restraints, of, serfdom, on, personal, and, economic, choice, were, enforced, through, various, forms, of, manorial, customary, law, and, the, manorial, administration, and, court, baron, it, was, also, a, matter, of, discussion, whether, serfs, could, be, required, by, law, in, times, of, war, or, conflict, to, fight, for, their, lord, s, land, and, property, in, the, case, of, their, lord, s, defeat, their, own, fate, might, be, uncertain, so, the, serf, certainly, had, an, interest, in, supporting, his, lord, within, his, constraints, a, serf, had, some, freedoms, though, the, common, wisdom, is, that, a, serf, owned, only, his, belly, even, his, clothes, were, the, property, in, law, of, his, lord, a, serf, might, still, accumulate, personal, property, and, wealth, and, some, serfs, became, wealthier, than, their, free, neighbours, although, this, happened, rarely, a, well, to, do, serf, might, even, be, able, to, buy, his, freedom, a, serf, could, grow, what, crop, he, saw, fit, on, his, lands, although, a, serf, s, taxes, often, had, to, be, paid, in, wheat, the, surplus, he, would, sell, at, market, the, landlord, could, not, dispossess, his, serfs, without, legal, cause, and, was, supposed, to, protect, them, from, the, depredations, of, robbers, or, other, lords, and, he, was, expected, to, support, them, by, charity, in, times, of, famine, many, such, rights, were, enforceable, by, the, serf, in, the, manorial, court, forms, of, serfdom, varied, greatly, through, time, and, regions, in, some, places, serfdom, was, merged, with, or, exchanged, for, various, forms, of, taxation, the, amount, of, labour, required, varied, in, poland, for, example, it, was, commonly, a, few, days, per, year, per, household, in, the, 13th, century, one, day, per, week, per, household, in, the, 14th, century, four, days, per, week, per, household, in, the, 17th, century, and, six, days, per, week, per, household, in, the, 18th, century, early, serfdom, in, poland, was, mostly, limited, to, the, royal, territories, kr, lewszczyzny, per, household, means, that, every, dwelling, had, to, give, a, worker, for, the, required, number, of, days, for, example, in, the, 18th, century, six, people, a, peasant, his, wife, three, children, and, a, hired, worker, might, be, required, to, work, for, their, lord, one, day, a, week, which, would, be, counted, as, six, days, of, labour, serfs, served, on, occasion, as, soldiers, in, the, event, of, conflict, and, could, earn, freedom, or, even, ennoblement, for, valour, in, combat, serfs, could, purchase, their, freedom, be, manumitted, by, generous, owners, or, flee, to, towns, or, to, newly, settled, land, where, few, questions, were, asked, laws, varied, from, country, to, country, in, england, a, serf, who, made, his, way, to, a, chartered, town, i, e, a, borough, and, evaded, recapture, for, a, year, and, a, day, obtained, his, freedom, and, became, a, burgher, of, the, town, in, the, aztec, empire, the, tlacotin, class, held, similarities, to, serfdom, even, at, its, height, slaves, only, ever, made, up, 2, of, the, population, the, paroikoi, were, the, byzantine, equivalent, of, serfs, serfdom, in, france, started, to, diminish, after, the, black, death, in, france, when, the, lack, of, work, force, made, manumission, more, common, from, that, point, onward, and, by, the, 18th, century, serfdom, had, become, relatively, rare, in, most, of, france, in, 1779, the, reforms, of, jacques, necker, abolished, serfdom, in, all, crown, lands, in, france, on, the, outbreak, of, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, between, 140, 000, and, 1, 500, 000, serfs, remained, in, france, most, of, them, on, clerical, lands, in, franche, comt, berry, burgundy, and, marche, however, although, formal, serfdom, no, longer, existed, in, most, of, france, the, feudal, seigneurial, laws, still, granted, noble, landlords, many, of, the, rights, previously, exercised, over, serfs, and, the, peasants, of, auvergne, nivernais, and, champagne, though, formally, not, serfs, could, still, not, move, freely, serfdom, was, formally, abolished, in, france, on, 4, august, 1789, and, the, remaining, feudal, rights, that, gave, landlords, control, rights, over, peasants, were, abolished, in, 1789, 93, in, gaelic, ireland, a, political, and, social, system, existing, in, ireland, from, the, prehistoric, period, 500, bc, or, earlier, up, until, the, norman, conquest, 12th, century, ad, the, bothach, hut, dweller, fuidir, perhaps, linked, to, fot, soil, and, sencl, ithe, old, dwelling, house, were, low, ranked, semi, free, servile, tenants, similar, to, serfs, according, to, laurence, ginnell, the, sencl, ithe, and, bothach, were, not, free, to, leave, the, territory, except, with, permission, and, in, practice, they, usually, served, the, flaith, they, had, no, political, or, clan, rights, could, neither, sue,
