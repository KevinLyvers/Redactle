of, the, habsburgs, during, its, existence, it, was, the, third, most, populous, monarchy, in, europe, after, the, russian, empire, and, the, united, kingdom, while, geographically, it, was, the, third, largest, empire, in, europe, after, the, russian, empire, and, the, first, french, empire, the, empire, was, proclaimed, by, francis, ii, in, 1804, in, response, to, napoleon, s, declaration, of, the, first, french, empire, unifying, all, habsburg, possessions, under, one, central, government, it, remained, part, of, the, holy, roman, empire, until, the, latter, s, dissolution, in, 1806, it, continued, fighting, against, napoleon, throughout, the, napoleonic, wars, except, for, a, period, between, 1809, and, 1813, when, austria, was, first, allied, with, napoleon, during, the, invasion, of, russia, and, later, neutral, during, the, first, few, weeks, of, the, sixth, coalition, war, austria, and, its, allies, emerged, victorious, in, the, war, leading, to, the, congress, of, vienna, which, reaffirmed, the, empire, as, one, of, the, great, powers, of, the, 19th, century, the, kingdom, of, hungary, as, regnum, independens, was, administered, by, its, own, institutions,

and, regensburg, 1801, 1803, on, 24, march, 1803, the, imperial, recess, german, reichsdeputationshauptschluss, was, declared, which, reduced, the, number, of, ecclesiastical, states, from, 81, to, only, 3, and, the, free, imperial, cities, from, 51, to, 6, this, measure, was, aimed, at, replacing, the, old, constitution, of, the, holy, roman, empire, but, the, actual, consequence, of, the, imperial, recess, along, with, the, french, occupying, the, electorate, of, hanover, in, the, same, month, and, various, holy, roman, states, becoming, allied, with, or, against, france, was, the, end, of, the, empire, taking, this, significant, change, into, consideration, holy, roman, emperor, francis, ii, created, the, title, emperor, of, austria, for, himself, and, his, successors, thereby, becoming, francis, i, of, austria, this, new, title, and, state, were, created, to, safeguard, his, dynasty, s, imperial, status, as, he, foresaw, either, the, end, of, the, holy, roman, empire, or, the, eventual, accession, of, napoleon, as, holy, roman, emperor, who, had, earlier, that, year, adopted, the, title, emperor, of, the, french, and, established, the, first, french, empire, initially,

of, the, habsburg, monarchy, which, had, until, then, been, legally, separate, realms, in, personal, union, a, composite, monarchy, under, francis, and, his, predecessors, by, contrast, the, austrian, empire, was, legally, a, single, state, although, the, overarching, structure, and, the, status, of, its, component, lands, at, first, stayed, much, the, same, as, they, had, been, under, the, composite, monarchy, this, was, especially, demonstrated, by, the, status, of, the, kingdom, of, hungary, a, country, that, had, never, been, a, part, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, which, had, always, been, considered, a, separate, realm, a, status, that, was, affirmed, by, article, x, which, was, added, to, hungary, s, constitution, in, 1790, and, described, the, state, as, a, regnum, independens, hungary, s, affairs, remained, administered, by, its, own, institutions, king, and, diet, as, they, had, been, beforehand, thus, no, imperial, institutions, were, involved, in, its,

with, an, armistice, on, 6, december, 1805, the, french, victories, encouraged, rulers, of, certain, imperial, territories, to, ally, themselves, with, the, french, and, assert, their, formal, independence, from, the, empire, on, 10, december, 1805, maximilian, iv, joseph, the, prince, elector, and, duke, of, bavaria, proclaimed, himself, king, followed, by, the, duke, of, w, rttemberg,

amounts, of, territory, to, napoleon, s, german, allies, and, the, french, satellite, kingdom, of, italy, in, practice, this, meant, the, dissolution, of, the, long, lived, holy, roman, empire, and, a, reorganization, under, a, napoleonic, model, of, the, german, states, austrian, claims, on, those, german, states, were, renounced, without, exception, on, 12, july, 1806, the, confederation, of,

policies, were, strongly, against, revolution, and, liberalism, in, his, opinion, liberalism, was, a, form, of, legalized, revolution, metternich, believed, that, absolute, monarchy, was, the, only, proper, system, of, government, this, notion, influenced, his, anti, revolutionary, policy, to, ensure, the, continuation, of, the, habsburg, monarchy, in, europe, metternich, was, a, practitioner, of, balance, of, power, diplomacy, his, foreign, policy, aimed, to, maintain, international, political, equilibrium, to, preserve, the, habsburgs, power, and, influence, in, international, affairs,

whose, monarchs, had, a, similar, interest, in, preserving, conservative, political, direction, metternich, was, able, to, establish, the, austrian, empire, s, influence, on, european, politics, also,

under, metternich, nationalist, revolts, in, austrian, north, italy, and, in, the, german, states, were, forcibly, crushed, at, home, he, pursued, a, similar, policy, to, suppress, revolutionary, and,

metternich, francis, i, s, brother, archduke, louis, and, count, franz, anton, kolowrat, who, later, became, the, first, minister, president, of, the, austrian, empire, the, liberal, revolutions, of, 1848, in, the, austrian, empire, forced, metternich, s, resignation, metternich, is, remembered, for, his, success, in, maintaining, the, status, quo, and, the, habsburg, influence, in, international, affairs, no, habsburg, foreign, minister, following, metternich, held, a, similar, position, within, the, empire, for, such, a, long, time, nor, held, such, a, vast, influence, on, european, foreign, affairs, historians, generally, consider, the, metternich, era, as, a, period, of, stability, the, austrian, empire, fought, no, wars, nor, did, it, undergo, any, radical, internal, reforms, however, it, was, also, thought, of, as, a, period, of, economic, growth, and, prosperity, in, the, austrian, empire, the, population, of, austria, rose, to, 37, 5, million, by, 1843, urban, expansion, also, occurred, and, the, population, of, vienna, reached, 400, 000, during, the, metternich, era, the, austrian, empire, also, maintained, a, stable, economy, and, reached, an, almost, balanced, budget, despite, having, a, major, deficit, following, the, napoleonic, wars, from, march, 1848, through, november, 1849, the, empire, was, threatened, by, revolutionary, movements, most, of, which, were, of, a, nationalist, character, besides, that, liberal, and, even, socialist, currents, resisted, the, empire, s, longstanding, conservatism, although, most, of, the, revolution, plans, failed, some, changes, were, made, significant, lasting, reforms, included, the, abolition, of, serfdom, cancellation, of, censorship, and, a, promise, made, by, ferdinand, i, of, austria, said, to, implement, a, constitution, throughout, the, whole, empire, after, the, death, of, prince, felix, of, schwarzenberg, in, 1852, the, minister, of, the, interior, baron, alexander, von, bach, largely, dictated, policy, in, austria, and, hungary, bach, centralized, administrative, authority, for, the, austrian, empire, but, he, also, endorsed, reactionary, policies, that, reduced, freedom, of, the, press, and, abandoned, public, trials, he, later, represented, the, absolutist, or, klerikalabsolutist, party, which, culminated, in, the, concordat, of, august, 1855, that, gave, the, roman, catholic, church, control, over, education, and, family, life, this, period, in, the, history, of, the, austrian, empire, would, become, known, as, the, era, of, neo, absolutism, or, bach, s, absolutism, the, pillars, of, the, so, called, bach, system, bachsches, system, were, in, the, words, of, adolf, fischhof, four, armies, a, standing, army, of, soldiers, a, sitting, army, of, office, holders, a, kneeling, army, of, priests, and, a, fawning, army, of, sneaks, prisons, were, full, of, political, prisoners, like, czech, nationalist, journalist, and, writer, karel, havl, ek, borovsk, who, was, forcibly, expatriated, 1851, 1855, to, brixen, this, exile, undermined, borovsk, s, health, and, he, died, soon, afterwards, this, affair, earned, bach, a, very, bad, reputation, among, czechs, and, subsequently, led, to, the, strengthening, of, the, czech, national, movement, however, bach, s, relaxed, ideological, views, apart, from, the, neo, absolutism, led, to, a, great, rise, in, the, 1850s, of, economic, freedom, internal, customs, duties, were, abolished, and, peasants, were, emancipated, from, their, feudal, obligations, in, her, capacity, as, leader, of, the, german,

constitution, of, 1861, also, known, as, february, patent, created, a, house, of, lords, herrenhaus, and, a, house, of, deputies, abgeordnetenhaus, but, most, nationalities, of, the, monarchy, remained, dissatisfied, after, the, second, war, with, denmark, in, 1864, holstein, came, under, austrian, administration, and, schleswig, and, lauenburg, under, prussian, administration, but, the, internal, difficulties, continued, diets, replaced, the, parliament, in, 17, provinces, the, hungarians, pressed, for, autonomy, and, venetia, was, attracted, by, the, now, unified, italy, after, the, austrian, army, was, defeated, in, the, austro, prussian, war, of, 1866, and, the, german, confederation, was, dissolved, the, austro, hungarian, compromise, of, 1867, was, adopted, by, this, act, the, kingdom, of, hungary, and, the, empire, of, austria, as, two, separate, entities, joined, on, an, equal, basis, to, form, the, dual, monarchy, of, austria, hungary, the, frequent, abbreviation, k, u, k, kaiserliche, und, k, nigliche, imperial, and, royal, does, not, refer, to, that, dual, monarchy, but, originated, in, 1745, when, the, royal, part, referred, to, the, apostolic, kingdom, of, hungary, however, during, world, war, i, austria, hungary, issued, military, stamps, for, use, in, occupied, regions, with, the, text, k, u, k, feldpost, or, k, u, k, milit, rpost, the, napoleonic, wars, dominated, austrian, foreign, policy, from, 1804, to, 1815, the, austrian, army, was, one, of, the, most, formidable, forces, the, french, had, to, face, after, prussia, signed, a, peace, treaty, with, france, on, 5, april, 1795, austria, was, forced, to, carry, the, main, burden, of, war, with, napoleonic, france, for, almost, ten, years, this, severely, overburdened, the, austrian, economy, making, the, war, greatly, unpopular, emperor, francis, i, therefore, refused, to, join, any, further, war, against, napoleon, for, a, long, time, on, the, other, hand, francis, i, continued, to, intrigue, for, the, possibility, of, revenge, against, france, entering, into, a, secret, military, agreement, with, the, russian, empire, in, november, 1804, this, convention, was, to, assure, mutual, cooperation, in, the, case, of, a, new, war, against, france, austrian, unwillingness, to, join, the, third, coalition, was, overcome, by, british, subsidies, but, the, austrians, withdrew, from, the, war, yet, again, after, a, decisive, defeat, at, the, battle, of, austerlitz, although, the, austrian, budget, suffered, from, wartime, expenditures, and, its, international, position, was, significantly, undermined, the, humiliating, treaty, of, pressburg, provided, plenty, of, time, to, strengthen, the, army, and, economy, moreover, the, ambitious, archduke, charles, and, johann, philipp, von, stadion, never, abandoned, the, goal, of, further, war, with, france, archduke, charles, of, austria, served, as, the, head, of, the, council, of, war, and, commander, in, chief, of, the, austrian, army, endowed, with, the, enlarged, powers, he, reformed, the, austrian, army, to, preparedness, for, another, war, johann, philipp, von, stadion, the, foreign, minister, personally, hated, napoleon, due, to, an, experience, of, confiscation, of, his, possessions, in, france, by, napoleon, in, addition, the, third, wife, of, francis, i, maria, ludovika, of, austria, este, agreed, with, stadion, s, efforts, to, begin, a, new, war, klemens, wenzel, von, metternich, located, in, paris, called, for, careful, advance, in, the, case, of, the, war, against, france, the, defeat, of, french, army, at, the, battle, of, bail, n, in, spain, on, 27, july, 1808, triggered, the, war, on, 9, april, 1809, an, austrian, force, of, 170, 000, men, attacked, bavaria, despite, military, defeats, of, the, austrian, army, especially, the, battles, of, marengo, ulm, austerlitz, and, wagram, and, consequently, lost, territory, throughout, the, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, wars, the, treaties, of, campo, formio, in, 1797, luneville, in, 1801, pressburg, in, 1806, and, sch, nbrunn, in, 1809, austria, played, a, decisive, part, in, the, overthrow, of, napoleon, in, the, campaigns, of, 1813, 14, it, participated, in, a, second, invasion, of, france, in, 1815, and, put, an, end, to, murat, s, regime, in, south, italy, the, latter, period, of, napoleonic, wars, featured, metternich, exerting, a, large, degree, of, influence, over, foreign, policy, in, the, austrian, empire, a, matter, nominally, decided, by, the, emperor, metternich, initially, supported, an, alliance, with, france, arranging, the, marriage, between, napoleon, and, francis, i, s, daughter, marie, louise, however, by, the, 1812, campaign, he, had, realised, the, inevitability, of, napoleon, s, downfall, and, took, austria, to, war, against, france, metternich, s, influence, at, the, congress, of, vienna, was, remarkable, and, he, became, not, only, the, premier, statesman, in, europe, but, the, virtual, ruler, of, the, empire, until, 1848, the, year, of, revolutions, and, the, rise, of, liberalism, equated, to, his, political, downfall, the, result, was, that, the, austrian, empire, was, seen, as, one, of, the, great, powers, after, 1815, but, also, as, a, reactionary, force, and, an, obstacle, to, national, aspirations, in, italy, and, germany, during, this, time, metternich, was, able, to, maintain, an, elaborate, balance, between, prussia, the, lesser, german, states, and, austria, in, the, german, confederation, thanks, to, his, efforts, austria, was, seen, as, the, senior, partner, with, prussia, keeping, watch, over, germany, as, a, whole, further, metternich, opposed, the, weakening, of, france, in, the, years, after, napoleon, and, viewed, the, new, monarchy, in, paris, as, an, effective, tool, in, keeping, russia, at, bay, from, 1815, to, 1848, metternich, steered, austria, imperial, foreign, policy, and, indeed, the, mood, of, europe, and, managed, to, keep, peace, on, the, continent, despite, the, growing, liberal, and, radical, movements, inside, most, major, powers, his, resignation, in, 1848, forced, by, moderates, in, the, court, and, revolutionaries, in, the, streets, may, have, caused, the, spread, of, the, revolutions, throughout, the, monarchy, it, is, stipulated, that, metternich, s, departure, emboldened, liberal, factions, in, austria, and, hungary, but, this, cannot, be, confirmed, for, certain, during, the, crimean, war, austria, maintained, a, policy, of, hostile, neutrality, towards, russia, and, while, not, going, to, war, was, supportive, of, the, anglo, french, coalition, having, abandoned, its, alliance, with, russia, austria, was, diplomatically, isolated, following, the, war, which, contributed, to, russia, s, non, intervention, in, the, 1859, franco, austrian, war, which, meant, the, end, of, austrian, influence, in, italy, and, in, the, 1866, austro, prussian, war, with, the, loss, of, its, influence, in, most, german, speaking, land, crown, lands, of, the, austrian, empire, after, the, 1815, congress, of, vienna, including, the, local, government, reorganizations, from, the, revolutions, of, 1848, to, the, 1860, october, diploma, the, old, habsburg, possessions, of, further, austria, in, today, s, france, germany, and, switzerland, had, already, been, lost, in, the, 1805, peace, of, pressburg, from, 1850, croatia, slavonia, and, the, military, frontier, constituted, a, single, land, with, disaggregated, provincial, and, military, administration, and, representation, administratively, most, of, the, crown, lands, excluding, hungary, croatia, slavonia, transylvania, lombardy, venetia, and, the, military, frontier, were, divided, into, kreise, circles, an, administrative, division, introduced, under, maria, theresa, in, the, 18th, century, following, the, revolutions, of, 1848, a, brief, attempt, was, made, to, introduce, modern, style, political, districts, in, addition, to, the, kreise, but, the, reforms, of, bach, in, 1853, 54, instead, instituted, a, system, which, delegated, the, responsibilities, of, the, kreise, among, subordinate, amtsbezirke, office, districts, a, system, which, persisted, until, 1867, in, the, course, of, the, post, 1848, reforms, transylvania, was, also, divided, into, kreise, in, 1851, re, divided, in, 1854, the, voivodeship, of, serbia, and, banat, of, temeschwar, was, also, divided, into, kreise, german, was, the, primary, language, of, higher, education, in, the, empire
