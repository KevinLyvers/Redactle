canaan, state, of, israel, 1948, present, the, history, of, ancient, israel, and, judah, spans, from, the, early, appearance, of, the, israelites, in, canaan, s, hill, country, during, the, late, second, millennium, bce, to, the, establishment, and, subsequent, downfall, of, the, two, israelite, kingdoms, in, the, mid, first, millennium, bce, this, history, unfolds, within, the, southern, levant, during, the, iron, age, the, earliest, documented, mention, of, israel, as, a, people, appears, on, the, merneptah, stele, an, ancient, egyptian, inscription, dating, back, to, around, 1208, bce, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, ancient, israelite, culture, evolved, from, the, pre, existing, canaanite, civilization, during, the, iron, age, ii, period, two, israelite, kingdoms, emerged, covering, much, of, canaan, the, kingdom, of, israel, in, the, north, and, the, kingdom, of, judah, in, the, south, according, to, the, hebrew, bible, a, united, monarchy, consisting, of, israel, and, judah, existed, as, early, as, the, 11th, century, bce, under, the, reigns, of, saul, david, and, solomon, the, great, kingdom, later, was, separated, into, two, smaller, kingdoms, israel, containing, the, cities, of, shechem, and, samaria, in, the, north, and, judah, containing, jerusalem, and, solomon, s, temple, in, the, south, the, historicity, of, the, united, monarchy, is, debated, as, there, are, no, archaeological, remains, of, it, that, are, accepted, as, consensus, but, historians, and, archaeologists, agree, that, israel, and, judah, existed, as, separate, kingdoms, by, c, 900, bce, 169, 195, and, c, 850, bce, respectively, the, kingdoms, history, is, known, in, greater, detail, than, that, of, other, kingdoms, in, the, levant, primarily, due, to, the, selective, narratives, in, the, books, of, samuel, kings, and, chronicles, which, were, included, in, the, bible, the, northern, kingdom, of, israel, was, destroyed, around, 720, bce, when, it, was, conquered, by, the, neo, assyrian, empire, while, the, kingdom, of, judah, remained, intact, during, this, time, it, became, a, client, state, of, first, the, neo, assyrian, empire, and, then, the, neo, babylonian, empire, however, jewish, revolts, against, the, babylonians, led, to, the, destruction, of, judah, in, 586, bce, under, the, rule, of, babylonian, king, nebuchadnezzar, ii, according, to, the, biblical, account, the, armies, of, nebuchadnezzar, ii, besieged, jerusalem, between, 589, 586, bce, which, led, to, the, destruction, of, solomon, s, temple, and, the, exile, of, the, jews, to, babylon, this, event, was, also, recorded, in, the, babylonian, chronicles, the, exilic, period, saw, the, development, of, the, israelite, religion, towards, a, monotheistic, judaism, the, exile, ended, with, the, fall, of, babylon, to, the, achaemenid, empire, c, 538, bce, subsequently, the, achaemenid, king, cyrus, the, great, issued, a, proclamation, known, as, the, edict, of, cyrus, which, authorized, and, encouraged, exiled, jews, to, return, to, judah, cyrus, proclamation, began, the, exiles, return, to, zion, inaugurating, the, formative, period, in, which, a, more, distinctive, jewish, identity, developed, in, the, persian, province, of, yehud, during, this, time, the, destroyed, solomon, s, temple, was, replaced, by, the, second, temple, marking, the, beginning, of, the, second, temple, period, the, iron, age, ii, period, is, followed, by, periods, named, after, conquering, empires, such, as, the, neo, babylonians, becoming, the, godfathers, for, the, babylonian, period, 586, 539, bce, other, academic, terms, often, used, are, the, return, to, zion, and, the, construction, of, the, second, temple, marked, the, beginning, of, the, second, temple, period, c,

between, the, sea, and, the, arabian, desert, the, coastal, plain, of, the, southern, levant, broad, in, the, south, and, narrowing, to, the, north, is, backed, in, its, southernmost, portion, by, a, zone, of, foothills, the, shfela, like, the, plain, this, narrows, as, it, goes, northwards, ending, in, the, promontory, of, mount, carmel, east, of, the, plain, and, the, shfela, is, a, mountainous,

a, battleground, among, the, powerful, entities, that, surrounded, it, canaan, in, the, late, bronze, age, was, a, shadow, of, what, it, had, been, centuries, earlier, many, cities, were, abandoned, others, shrank, in, size, and, the, total, settled, population, was, probably, not, much, more, than, a, hundred, thousand, settlement, was, concentrated, in, cities, along, the, coastal, plain, and, along, major, communication, routes, the, central, and, northern, hill, country, which, would, later, become, the, biblical, kingdom, of, israel, was, only, sparsely, inhabited, although, letters, from, the, egyptian, archives, indicate, that, jerusalem, was, already, a, canaanite, city, state, recognizing, egyptian, overlordship, politically, and, culturally, it, was, dominated, by, egypt, each, city, under, its, own, ruler, constantly, at, odds, with, its, neighbours, and, appealing, to, the, egyptians, to, adjudicate, their, differences, the, canaanite, city, state, system, broke, down, during, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, and, canaanite, culture, was, then, gradually, absorbed, into, those, of, the, philistines, phoenicians, and, israelites, the, process, was, gradual, and, a, strong, egyptian, presence, continued, into, the, 12th, century, bce, and, while, some, canaanite, cities, were, destroyed, others, continued, to, exist, in, iron, age, i, the, name, israel, first, appears, in, the, merneptah, stele, c, 1208, bce, israel, is, laid, waste, and, his, seed, is, no, more, this, israel, was, a, cultural, and, probably, political, entity, well, enough, established, for, the, egyptians, to, perceive, it, as, a, possible, challenge, but, an, ethnic, group, rather, than, an, organized, state, archaeologist, paula, mcnutt, says, it, is, probably, during, iron, age, i, a, population, began, to, identify, itself, as, israelite, differentiating, itself, from, its, neighbours, via, prohibitions, on, intermarriage, an, emphasis, on, family, history, and, genealogy, and, religion, in, the, late, bronze, age, there, were, no, more, than, about, 25, villages, in, the, highlands, but, this, increased, to, over, 300, by, the, end, of, iron, age, i, while, the, settled, population, doubled, from, 20, 000, to, 40, 000, the, villages, were, more, numerous, and, larger, in, the, north, and, probably, shared, the, highlands, with, pastoral, nomads, who, left, no, remains, archaeologists, and, historians, attempting, to, trace, the, origins, of, these, villagers, have, found, it, impossible, to, identify, any, distinctive, features, that, could, define, them, as, specifically, israelite, collared, rim, jars, and, four, room, houses, have, been, identified, outside, the, highlands, and, thus, cannot, be, used, to, distinguish, israelite, sites, and, while, the, pottery, of, the, highland, villages, is, far, more, limited, than, that, of, lowland, canaanite, sites, it, develops, typologically, out, of, canaanite, pottery, that, came, before, israel, finkelstein, proposed, that, the, oval, or, circular, layout, that, distinguishes, some, of, the, earliest, highland, sites, and, the, notable, absence, of, pig, bones, from, hill, sites, could, be, taken, as, markers, of, ethnicity, but, others, have, cautioned, that, these, can, be, a, common, sense, adaptation, to, highland, life, and, not, necessarily, revelatory, of, origins, other, aramaean, sites, also, demonstrate, a, contemporary, absence, of, pig, remains, at, that, time, unlike, earlier, canaanite, and, later, philistine, excavations, in, the, bible, unearthed, 2001, finkelstein, and, silberman, summarized, recent, studies, they, described, how, up, until, 1967, the, israelite, heartland, in, the, highlands, of, western, palestine, was, virtually, an, archaeological, terra, incognita, since, then, intensive, surveys, have, examined, the, traditional, territories, of, the, tribes, of, judah, benjamin, ephraim, and, manasseh, these, surveys, have, revealed, the, sudden, emergence, of, a, new, culture, contrasting, with, the, philistine, and, canaanite, societies, existing, in, canaan, in, the, iron, age, this, new, culture, is, characterized, by, a, lack, of, pork, remains, whereas, pork, formed, 20, of, the, philistine, diet, in, places, by, an, abandonment, of, the, philistine, canaanite, custom, of, having, highly, decorated, pottery, and, by, the, practice, of, circumcision, the, israelite, ethnic, identity, had, originated, not, from, the, exodus, and, a, subsequent, conquest, but, from, a, transformation, of, the, existing, canaanite, philistine, cultures, these, surveys, revolutionized, the, study, of, early, israel, the, discovery, of, the, remains, of, a, dense, network, of, highland, villages, all, apparently, established, within, the, span, of, few, generations, indicated, that, a, dramatic, social, transformation, had, taken, place, in, the, central, hill, country, of, canaan, around, 1200, bce, there, was, no, sign, of, violent, invasion, or, even, the, infiltration, of, a, clearly, defined, ethnic, group, instead, it, seemed, to, be, a, revolution, in, lifestyle, in, the, formerly, sparsely, populated, highlands, from, the, judean, hills, in, the, south, to, the, hills, of, samaria, in, the, north, far, from, the, canaanite, cities, that, were, in, the, process, of, collapse, and, disintegration, about, two, hundred, fifty, hilltop, communities, suddenly, sprang, up, here, were, the, first, israelites, modern, scholars, therefore, see, israel, arising, peacefully, and, internally, from, existing, people, in, the, highlands, of, canaan, extensive, archaeological, excavations, have, provided, a, picture, of, israelite, society, during, the, early, iron, age, period, the, archaeological, evidence, indicates, a, society, of, village, like, centres, but, with, more, limited, resources, and, a, small, population, during, this, period, israelites, lived, primarily, in, small, villages, the, largest, of, which, had, populations, of, up, to, 300, or, 400, their, villages, were, built, on, hilltops, their, houses, were, built, in, clusters, around, a, common, courtyard, they, built, three, or, four, room, houses, out, of, mudbrick, with, a, stone, foundation, and, sometimes, with, a, second, story, made, of, wood, the, inhabitants, lived, by, farming, and, herding, they, built, terraces, to, farm, on, hillsides, planting, various, crops, and, maintaining, orchards, the, villages, were, largely, economically, self, sufficient, and, economic, interchange, was, prevalent, according, to, the, bible, prior, to, the, rise, of, the, israelite, monarchy, the, early, israelites, were, led, by, the, biblical, judges, or, chieftains, who, served, as, military, leaders, in, times, of, crisis, scholars, are, divided, over, the, historicity, of, this, account, however, it, is, likely, that, regional, chiefdoms, and, polities, provided, security, the, small, villages, were, unwalled, but, were, likely, subjects, of, the, major, town, in, the, area, writing, was, known, and, available, for, recording, even, at, small, sites, according, to, israel, finkelstein, after, an, emergent, and, large, polity, was, suddenly, formed, based, on, the, gibeon, gibeah, plateau, and, destroyed, by, shoshenq, i, the, biblical, shishak, in, the, 10th, century, bce, a, return, to, small, city, states, was, prevalent, in, the, southern, levant, but, between, 950, and, 900, bce, another, large, polity, emerged, in, the, northern, highlands, with, its, capital, eventually, at, tirzah, that, can, be, considered, the, precursor, of, the, kingdom, of, israel, the, kingdom, of, israel, was, consolidated, as, an, important, regional, power, by, the, first, half, of, the, 9th, century, bce, before, falling, to, the, neo, assyrian, empire, in, 722, bce, and, the, kingdom, of, judah, began, to, flourish, in, the, second, half, of, the, 9th, century, bce, unusually, favourable, climatic, conditions, in, the, first, two, centuries, of, iron, age, ii, brought, about, an, expansion, of, population, settlements, and, trade, throughout, the, region, in, the, central, highlands, this, resulted, in, unification, in, a, kingdom, with, the, city, of, samaria, as, its, capital, possibly, by, the, second, half, of, the, 10th, century, bce, when, an, inscription, of, the, egyptian, pharaoh, shoshenq, i, records, a, series, of, campaigns, directed, at, the, area, israel, had, clearly, emerged, in, the, first, half, of, the, 9th, century, bce, this, is, attested, when, the, assyrian, king, shalmaneser, iii, names, ahab, sir, lit, among, his, enemies, at, the, battle, of, qarqar, 853, bce, on, the, kurkh, monoliths, this, sir, lit, is, most, often, interpreted, as, israel, at, this, time, israel, was, apparently, engaged, in, a, three, way, contest, with, damascus, and, tyre, for, control, of, the, jezreel, valley, and, galilee, in, the, north, and, with, moab, ammon, and, aram, damascus, in, the, east, for, control, of, gilead, the, mesha, stele, c, 830, bce, left, by, a, king, of, moab, celebrates, his, success, in, throwing, off, the, oppression, of, the, house, of, omri, i, e, israel, it, bears, what, is, generally, thought, to, be, the, earliest, extra, biblical, reference, to, the, name, yahweh, a, century, later, israel, came, into, increasing, conflict, with, the, expanding, neo, assyrian, empire, which, first, split, its, territory, into, several, smaller, units, and, then, destroyed, its, capital, samaria, 722, bce, both, the, biblical, and, assyrian, sources, speak, of, a, massive, deportation, of, people, from, israel, and, their, replacement, with, settlers, from, other, parts, of, the, empire, such, population, exchanges, were, an, established, part, of, assyrian, imperial, policy, a, means, of, breaking, the, old, power, structure, and, the, former, israel, never, again, became, an, independent, political, entity, finkelstein, holds, that, judah, emerged, as, an, operational, kingdom, somewhat, later, than, israel, during, the, second, half, of, 9th, century, bce, but, the, subject, is, one, of, considerable, controversy, there, are, indications, that, during, the, 10th, and, 9th, centuries, bce, the, southern, highlands, had, been, divided, between, a, number, of, centres, none, with, clear, primacy, during, the, reign, of, hezekiah, between, c, 715, and, 686, bce, a, notable, increase, in, the, power, of, the, judean, state, can, be, observed, this, is, reflected, in, archaeological, sites, and, findings, such, as, the, broad, wall, a, defensive, city, wall, in, jerusalem, and, the, siloam, tunnel, an, aqueduct, designed, to, provide, jerusalem, with, water, during, an, impending, siege, by, the, neo, assyrian, empire, led, by, sennacherib, and, the, siloam, inscription, a, lintel, inscription, found, over, the, doorway, of, a, tomb, has, been, ascribed, to, comptroller, shebna, lmlk, seals, on, storage, jar, handles, excavated, from, strata, in, and, around, that, formed, by, sennacherib, s, destruction, appear, to, have, been, used, throughout, sennacherib, s, 29, year, reign, along, with, bullae, from, sealed, documents, some, that, belonged, to, hezekiah, himself, and, others, that, name, his, servants, archaeological, records, indicate, that, the, kingdom, of, israel, was, fairly, prosperous, the, late, iron, age, saw, an, increase, in, urban, development, in, israel, whereas, previously, the, israelites, had, lived, mainly, in, small, and, unfortified, settlements, the, rise, of, the, kingdom, of, israel, saw, the, growth, of, cities, and, the, construction, of, palaces, large, royal, enclosures, and, fortifications, with, walls, and, gates, israel, initially, had, to, invest, significant, resources, into, defence, as, it, was, subjected, to, regular, aramean, incursions, and, attacks, but, after, the, arameans, were, subjugated, by, the, assyrians, and, israel, could, afford, to, put, less, resources, into, defending, its, territory, its, architectural, infrastructure, grew, dramatically, extensive, fortifications, were, built, around, cities, such, as, dan, megiddo, and, hazor, including, monumental, and, multi, towered, city, walls, and, multi, gate, entry, systems, israel, s, economy, was, based, on, multiple, industries, it, had, the, largest, olive, oil, production, centres, in, the, region, using, at, least, two, different, types, of, olive, oil, presses, and, also, had, a, significant, wine, industry, with, wine, presses, constructed, next, to, vineyards, by, contrast, the, kingdom, of, judah, was, significantly, less, advanced, some, scholars, believe, it, was, no, more, than, a, small, tribal, entity, limited, to, jerusalem, and, its, immediate, surroundings, in, the, 10th, and, early, 9th, centuries, bce, the, territory, of, judah, appears, to, have, been, sparsely, populated, limited, to, small, and, mostly, unfortified, settlements, the, status, of, jerusalem, in, the, 10th, century, bce, is, a, major, subject, of, debate, among, scholars, according, to, some, scholars, jerusalem, does, not, show, evidence, of, significant, israelite, residential, activity, until, the, 9th, century, bce, other, scholars, argue, that, recent, discoveries, and, radiocarbon, tests, in, the, city, of, david, seem, to, indicate, that, jerusalem, was, already, a, significant, city, by, the, 10th, century, bce, significant, administrative, structures, such, as, the, stepped, stone, structure, and, large, stone, structure, which, originally, formed, part, of, one, structure, also, contain, material, culture, from, the, 10th, century, bce, or, earlier, the, ruins, of, a, significant, judahite, military, fortress, tel, arad, have, also, been, found, in, the, negev, and, a, collection, of, military, orders, found, there, suggest, literacy, was, present, throughout, the, ranks, of, the, judahite, army, this, suggests, that, literacy, was, not, limited, to, a, tiny, elite, indicating, the, presence, of, a, substantial, educational, infrastructure, in, judah, in, the, 7th, century, jerusalem, grew, to, contain, a, population, many, times, greater, than, earlier, and, achieved, clear, dominance, over, its, neighbours, this, occurred, at, the, same, time, that, israel, was, being, destroyed, by, the, neo, assyrian, empire, and, was, probably, the, result, of, a, cooperative, arrangement, with, the, assyrians, to, establish, judah, as, an, assyrian, vassal, state, controlling, the, valuable, olive, industry, judah, prospered, as, a, vassal, state, despite, a, disastrous, rebellion, against, sennacherib, but, in, the, last, half, of, the, 7th, century, bce, assyria, suddenly, collapsed, and, the, ensuing, competition, between, egypt, and, the, neo, babylonian, empire, for, control, of, the, land, led, to, the, destruction, of, judah, in, a, series, of, campaigns, between, 597, and, 582, after, its, fall, the, former, kingdom, of, israel, became, the, assyrian, province, of, samerina, which, was, taken, over, about, a, century, later, by, the, neo, babylonian, empire, created, after, the, revolt, of, the, babylonians, and, them, defeating, the, neo, assyrian, empire, babylonian, judah, suffered, a, steep, decline, in, both, economy, and, population, and, lost, the, negev, the, shephelah, and, part, of, the, judean, hill, country, including, hebron, to, encroachments, from, edom, and, other, neighbours, jerusalem, destroyed, but, probably, not, totally, abandoned, was, much, smaller, than, previously, and, the, settlements, surrounding, it, as, well, as, the, towns, in, the, former, kingdom, s, western, borders, were, all, devastated, as, a, result, of, the, babylonian, campaign, the, town, of, mizpah, in, benjamin, in, the, relatively, unscathed, northern, section, of, the, kingdom, became, the, capital, of, the, new, babylonian, province, of, yehud, this, was, standard, babylonian, practice, when, the, philistine, city, of, ashkalon, was, conquered, in, 604, the, political, religious, and, economic, elite, but, not, the, bulk, of, the, population, was, banished, and, the, administrative, centre, shifted, to, a, new, location, there, is, also, a, strong, probability, that, for, most, or, all, of, the, period, the, temple, at, bethel, in, benjamin, replaced, that, at, jerusalem, boosting, the, prestige, of, bethel, s, priests, the, aaronites, against, those, of, jerusalem, the, zadokites, now, in, exile, in, babylon, the, babylonian, conquest, entailed, not, just, the, destruction, of, jerusalem, and, its, temple, but, the, liquidation, of, the, entire, infrastructure, which, had, sustained, judah, for, centuries, the, most, significant, casualty, was, the, state, ideology, of, zion, theology, the, idea, that, the, god, of, israel, had, chosen, jerusalem, for, his, dwelling, place, and, that, the, davidic, dynasty, would, reign, there, forever, the, fall, of, the, city, and, the, end, of, davidic, kingship, forced, the, leaders, of, the, exile, community, kings, priests, scribes, and, prophets, to, reformulate, the, concepts, of, community, faith, and, politics, the, exile, community, in, babylon, thus, became, the, source, of, significant, portions, of, the, hebrew, bible, isaiah, 40, 55, ezekiel, the, final, version, of, jeremiah, the, work, of, the, hypothesized, priestly, source, in, the, pentateuch, and, the, final, form, of, the, history, of, israel, from, deuteronomy, to, 2, kings, theologically, the, babylonian, exiles, were, responsible, for, the, doctrines, of, individual, responsibility, and, universalism, the, concept, that, one, god, controls, the, entire, world, and, for, the, increased, emphasis, on, purity, and, holiness, most, significantly, the, trauma, of, the, exile, experience, led, to, the, development, of, a, strong, sense, of, hebrew, identity, distinct, from, other, peoples, with, increased, emphasis, on, symbols, such, as, circumcision, and, sabbath, observance, to, sustain, that, distinction, hans, m, barstad, writes, that, the, concentration, of, the, biblical, literature, on, the, experience, of, the, exiles, in, babylon, disguises, that, the, great, majority, of, the, population, remained, in, judah, for, them, life, after, the, fall, of, jerusalem, probably, went, on, much, as, it, had, before, it, may, even, have, improved, as, they, were, rewarded, with, the, land, and, property, of, the, deportees, much, to, the, anger, of, the, community, of, exiles, remaining, in, babylon, conversely, avraham, faust, writes, that, archaeological, and, demographic, surveys, show, that, the, population, of, judah, was, significantly, reduced, to, barely, 10, of, what, it, had, been, in, the, time, before, the, exile, the, assassination, around, 582, of, the, babylonian, governor, by, a, disaffected, member, of, the, former, royal, house, of, david, provoked, a, babylonian, crackdown, possibly, reflected, in, the, book, of, lamentations, but, the, situation, seems, to, have, soon, stabilized, again, nevertheless, those, unwalled, cities, and, towns, that, remained, were, subject, to, slave, raids, by, the, phoenicians, and, intervention, in, their, internal, affairs, by, samaritans, arabs, and, ammonites, although, the, specific, process, by, which, the, israelites, adopted, monotheism, is, unknown, it, is, certain, that, the, transition, was, a, gradual, one, and, was, not, totally, accomplished, during, the, first, temple, period, more, is, known, about, this, period, as, during, this, time, writing, was, widespread, the, number, of, gods, that, the, israelites, worshipped, decreased, and, figurative, images, vanished, from, their, shrines, yahwism, as, some, scholars, name, this, belief, system, is, often, described, as, a, form, of, henotheism, or, monolatry, over, the, same, time, a, folk, religion, continued, to, be, practised, across, israel, and, judah, these, practices, were, influenced, by, the, polytheistic, beliefs, of, the, surrounding, ethnicities, and, were, denounced, by, the, prophets, in, addition, to, the, temple, in, jerusalem, there, was, public, worship, practised, all, over, israel, and, judah, in, shrines, and, sanctuaries, outdoors, and, close, to, city, gates, in, the, 8th, and, 7th, centuries, bce, the, kings, hezekiah, and, josiah, of, judah, implemented, a, number, of, significant, religious, reforms, that, aimed, to, centre, worship, of, the, god, of, israel, in, jerusalem, and, eliminate, foreign, customs, henotheism, is, the, act, of, worshipping, a, single, god, without, denying, the, existence, of, other, deities, many, scholars, believe, that, before, monotheism, in, ancient, israel, there, came, a, transitional, period, in, this, transitional, period, many, followers, of, the, israelite, religion, worshipped, the, god, yahweh, but, did, not, deny, the, existence, of, other, deities, accepted, throughout, the, region, henotheistic, worship, was, not, uncommon, in, the, ancient, near, east, as, many, iron, age, nation, states, worshipped, an, elevated, national, god, which, was, nonetheless, only, part, of, a, wider, pantheon, examples, include, chemosh, in, moab, qos, in, edom, milkom, in, ammon, and, ashur, in, assyria, canaanite, religion, syncretized, elements, from, neighbouring, cultures, largely, from, mesopotamian, religious, traditions, using, canaanite, religion, as, a, base, was, natural, due, to, the, fact, that, the, canaanite, culture, inhabited, the, same, region, prior, to, the, emergence, of, israelite, culture, israelite, religion, was, no, exception, as, during, the, transitional, period, yahweh, and, el, were, syncretized, in, the, israelite, pantheon, el, already, occupied, a, reasonably, important, place, in, the, israelite, religion, even, the, name, israel, is, based, on, the, name, el, rather, than, yahweh, it, was, this, initial, harmonization, of, israelite, and, canaanite, religious, thought, that, led, to, yahweh, gradually, absorbing, several, characteristics, from, canaanite, deities, in, turn, strengthening, his, own, position, as, an, all, powerful, one, even, still, monotheism, in, the, region, of, ancient, israel, and, judah, did, not, take, hold, overnight, and, during, the, intermediate, stages, most, people, are, believed, to, have, remained, henotheistic, during, this, intermediate, period, of, henotheism, many, families, worshipped, different, gods, religion, was, very, much, centred, around, the, family, as, opposed, to, the, community, the, region, of, israel, and, judah, was, sparsely, populated, during, the, time, of, moses, as, such, many, different, areas, worshipped, different, gods, due, to, social, isolation, it, was, not, until, later, on, in, israelite, history, that, people, started, to, worship, yahweh, alone, and, fully, convert, to, monotheistic, values, that, switch, occurred, with, the, growth, of, power, and, influence, of, the, israelite, kingdom, and, its, rulers, further, details, of, this, are, contained, in, the, iron, age, yahwism, section, below, evidence, from, the, bible, suggests, that, henotheism, did, exist, they, went, and, served, alien, gods, and, paid, homage, to, them, gods, of, whom, they, had, no, experience, and, whom, he, did, not, allot, to, them, deut, 29, 26, many, believe, that, this, quote, demonstrates, that, the, early, israelite, kingdom, followed, traditions, similar, to, ancient, mesopotamia, where, each, major, urban, centre, had, a, supreme, god, each, culture, embraced, their, patron, god, but, did, not, deny, the, existence, of, other, cultures, patron, gods, in, assyria, the, patron, god, was, ashur, and, in, ancient, israel, it, was, yahweh, however, both, israelite, and, assyrian, cultures, recognized, each, other, s, deities, during, this, period, some, scholars, have, used, the, bible, as, evidence, to, argue, that, most, of, the, people, alive, during, the, events, recounted, in, the, hebrew, bible, including, moses, were, most, likely, henotheists, there, are, many, quotes, from, the, hebrew, bible, that, are, used, to, support, this, view, one, such, quote, from, jewish, tradition, is, the, first, commandment, which, in, its, entirety, reads, i, am, the, lord, your, god, who, brought, you, out, of, the, land, of, egypt, out, of, the, house, of, bondage, you, shall, have, no, other, gods, before, me, this, quote, does, not, deny, the, existence, of, other, gods, it, merely, states, that, jews, should, consider, yahweh, or, god, the, supreme, god, incomparable, to, other, supernatural, beings, some, scholars, attribute, the, concept, of, angels, and, demons, found, in, judaism, and, christianity, to, the, tradition, of, henotheism, instead, of, completely, getting, rid, of, the, concept, of, other, supernatural, beings, these, religions, changed, former, deities, into, angels, and, demons, the, religion, of, the, israelites, of, iron, age, i, like, the, ancient, canaanite, religion, from, which, it, evolved, and, other, religions, of, the, ancient, near, east, was, based, on, a, cult, of, ancestors, and, worship, of, family, gods, the, gods, of, the, fathers, with, the, emergence, of, the, monarchy, at, the, beginning, of, iron, age, ii, the, kings, promoted, their, family, god, yahweh, as, the, god, of, the, kingdom, but, beyond, the, royal, court, religion, continued, to, be, both, polytheistic, and, family, centred, the, major, deities, were, not, numerous, el, asherah, and, yahweh, with, baal, as, a, fourth, god, and, perhaps, shamash, the, sun, in, the, early, period, at, an, early, stage, el, and, yahweh, became, fused, and, asherah, did, not, continue, as, a, separate, state, cult, although, she, continued, to, be, popular, at, a, community, level, until, persian, times, yahweh, the, national, god, of, both, israel, and, judah, seems, to, have, originated, in, edom, and, midian, in, southern, canaan, and, may, have, been, brought, to, israel, by, the, kenites, and, midianites, at, an, early, stage, there, is, a, general, consensus, among, scholars, that, the, first, formative, event, in, the, emergence, of, the, distinctive, religion, described, in, the, bible, was, triggered, by, the, destruction, of, israel, by, assyria, in, c, 722, bce, refugees, from, the, northern, kingdom, fled, to, judah, bringing, with, them, laws, and, a, prophetic, tradition, of, yahweh, this, religion, was, subsequently, adopted, by, the, landowners, of, judah, who, in, 640, bce, placed, the, eight, year, old, josiah, on, the, throne, judah, at, this, time, was, a, vassal, state, of, assyria, but, assyrian, power, collapsed, in, the, 630s, and, around, 622, josiah, and, his, supporters, launched, a, bid, for, independence, expressed, as, loyalty, to, yahweh, alone, according, to, the, deuteronomists, as, scholars, call, these, judean, nationalists, the, treaty, with, yahweh, would, enable, israel, s, god, to, preserve, both, the, city, and, the, king, in, return, for, the, people, s, worship, and, obedience, the, destruction, of, jerusalem, its, temple, and, the, davidic, dynasty, by, babylon, in, 587, 586, bce, was, deeply, traumatic, and, led, to, revisions, of, the, national, mythos, during, the, babylonian, exile, this, revision, was, expressed, in, the, deuteronomistic, history, the, books, of, joshua, judges, samuel, and, kings, which, interpreted, the, babylonian, destruction, as, divinely, ordained, punishment, for, the, failure, of, israel, s, kings, to, worship, yahweh, to, the, exclusion, of, all, other, deities, the, second, temple, period, 520, bce, 70, ce, differed, in, significant, ways, from, what, had, gone, before, strict, monotheism, emerged, among, the, priests, of, the, temple, establishment, during, the, seventh, and, sixth, centuries, bce, as, did, beliefs, regarding, angels, and, demons, at, this, time, circumcision, dietary, laws, and, sabbath, observance, gained, more, significance, as, symbols, of, jewish, identity, and, the, institution, of, the, synagogue, became, increasingly, important, and, most, of, the, biblical, literature, including, the, torah, was, substantially, revised, during, this, time, as, was, customary, in, the, ancient, near, east, a, king, hebrew, romanized, melekh, ruled, over, the, kingdoms, of, israel, and, judah, the, national, god, yahweh, who, selects, those, to, rule, his, realm, and, his, people, is, depicted, in, the, hebrew, bible, as, having, a, hand, in, the, establishment, of, the, royal, institution, in, this, sense, the, true, king, is, god, and, the, king, serves, as, his, earthly, envoy, and, is, tasked, with, ruling, his, realm, in, some, psalms, that, appear, to, be, related, to, the, coronation, of, kings, they, are, referred, to, as, sons, of, yahweh, the, kings, actually, had, to, succeed, one, another, according, to, a, dynastic, principle, even, though, the, succession, was, occasionally, decided, through, coups, d, tat, the, coronation, seemed, to, take, place, in, a, sacred, place, and, was, marked, by, the, anointing, of, the, king, who, then, becomes, the, anointed, one, m, a, the, origin, of, the, word, messiah, of, yahweh, the, end, of, the, ritual, seems, marked, by, an, acclamation, by, the, people, or, at, least, their, representatives, the, elders, followed, by, a, banquet, the, bible, s, descriptions, of, the, lists, of, dignitaries, from, the, reigns, of, david, and, solomon, show, that, the, king, is, supported, by, a, group, of, high, dignitaries, those, include, the, chief, of, the, army, hebrew, romanized, ar, ha, b, the, great, scribe, hebrew, romanized, ar, ha, b, who, was, in, charge, of, the, management, of, the, royal, chancellery, the, herald, hebrew, romanized, mazk, r, as, well, as, the, high, priest, hebrew, romanized, k, h, n, h, gg, d, l, and, the, master, of, the, palace, hebrew, romanized, al, habbayit, s, k, n, who, has, a, function, of, stewardship, of, the, household, of, the, king, at, the, beginning, and, seems, to, become, a, real, prime, minister, of, judah, during, the, later, periods, the, attributions, of, most, of, these, dignitaries, remain, debated, as, illustrated, in, particular, by, the, much, discussed, case, of, the, king, s, friend, mentioned, under, solomon
