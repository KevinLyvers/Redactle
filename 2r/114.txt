the, macedonian, s, conquests, were, divided, amongst, the, diadochi, at, the, partition, of, babylon, the, former, achaemenid, satrapy, of, media, was, divided, into, two, states, the, greater, southern, part, media, magna, was, assigned, to, peithon, one, of, alexander, s, bodyguards, the, smaller, northern, region, which, had, been, the, sub, satrapy, of, matiene, became, media, atropatene, under, atropates, the, former, achaemenid, governor, of, all, media, who, had, by, then, become, father, in, law, of, perdiccas, regent, of, alexander, s, designated, successor, shortly, thereafter, atropates, refused, to, pay, allegiance, to, seleucus, and, made, media, atropatene, an, independent, kingdom, in, 223, bce, antiochus, iii, came, to, power, in, the, seleucid, empire, one, of, the, hellenistic, states, that, had, emerged, following, the, death, of, alexander, antiochus, attacked, atropatene, resulting, in, a, victory, consequently, the, king, of, atropatene, artabazanes, accepted, the, ascendency, of, seleucids, and, became, dependent, on, it, on, the, other, hand, interior, independence, was, preserved, at, the, same, time, the, roman, empire, came, into, sight, in, the, mediterranean, basin, and, was, trying, to, spread, its, power, in, the, east, and, in, 190, b, c, its, army, met, and, defeated, the, seleucids, army, in, the, battle, of, magnesia, parthia, and, atropatene, subsequently, considered, rome, a, threat, to, their, independence, and, allied, themselves, in, the, struggle, against, rome, after, the, battle, between, rome, and, the, parthians, in, 38, bc, the, romans, won, and, the, roman, general, antony, attacked, fraaspa, 36, bc, one, of, the, central, cities, of, atropatene, the, city, was, surrounded, by, strong, defenses, after, a, long, blockade, antony, receded, losing, approximately, thirty, five, thousand, soldiers, in, the, face, of, parthian, attempts, to, annex, atropatene, atropatene, began, to, draw, closer, to, rome, thus, ariobarzan, ii, who, came, to, power, in, atropatene, in, 20, bc, lived, in, rome, for, about, ten, years, the, dynasty, atropates, founded, would, rule, the, kingdom, for, several, centuries, first, independently, then, as, vassals, of, the, arsacids, who, called, it, aturpatakan, it, was, later, supplanted, by, a, line, of, the, arsacids, during, the, late, parthian, era, the, empire, was, declining, resulting, in, the, weakening, of, hold, over, western, iran, the, iranologist, touraj, daryaee, argues, that, the, reign, of, the, parthian, monarch, vologases, v, r, 191, 208, was, the, turning, point, in, arsacid, history, in, that, the, dynasty, lost, much, of, its, prestige, the, people, of, atropatene, both, nobility, and, peasantry, allied, themselves, with, the, persian, sasanian, prince, ardashir, i, r, 224, 242, during, his, wars, against, vologases, v, s, son, and, second, successor, artabanus, iv, r, 216, 224, in, 226, atropatene, submitted, with, little, resistance, to, ardashir, i, after, he, had, defeated, and, killed, artabanus, iv, at, the, battle, of, hormozdgan, ardashir, i, and, his, son, and, heir, shapur, i, r, 240, 270, are, depicted, in, a, rock, relief, near, salmas, possibly, a, testimonial, to, the, sasanian, conquest, of, atropatene, the, nobility, of, atropatene, most, likely, allied, themselves, the, sasanians, due, to, a, desire, for, a, strong, state, capable, of, maintaining, order, the, priesthood, who, may, have, felt, alienated, by, the, easy, going, arsacids, probably, also, supported, the, sasanian, family, due, to, its, association, with, zoroastrianism, the, oldness, of, zoroastrianism, led, to, lack, of, knowledge, about, the, geography, of, the, avesta, and, also, uncertainty, about, the, birthplace, of, its, prophet, zoroaster, as, a, result, local, claims, emerged, quite, easily, and, with, the, appropriate, support, even, gained, acceptance, this, resulted, in, the, birthplace, of, zoroaster, being, placed, in, atropatene, rather, than, the, east, where, he, originated, the, main, achaemenid, hub, in, atropatene, was, ganzak, from, median, ganzaka, meaning, treasury, which, presumably, served, as, the, capital, of, atropates, and, his, successors, the, city, was, situated, in, a, fertile, area, near, lake, urmia, close, to, the, modern, town, of, miandoab, the, city, and, its, surroundings, probably, hosted, a, large, iranian, population, whereas, much, of, the, atropatenian, population, had, most, likely, not, been, completely, iranianized, yet, by, the, 3rd, century, bc, atropatene, was, the, only, iranian, region, to, remain, under, zoroastrian, authority, from, the, achaemenids, to, the, arab, conquest, without, any, interruption, aside, from, being, briefly, ruled, by, the, macedonian, king, alexander, the, great, r, 336, 323, bc, under, the, atropatids, the, region, successfully, managed, to, gain, a, dominant, place, in, zoroastrianism, which, would, continue, into, the, sasanian, period, whose, monarchs, favored, median, traditions, over, that, of, the, parthians, moreover, atropatene, also, served, as, a, stronghold, of, iranian, culture, albeit, the, kings, of, atropatene, ruled, for, several, centuries, only, some, of, them, are, known, the, dates, of, their, reign, are, uncertain, 37, n, 48, e, 37, n, 48, e, 37, 48
