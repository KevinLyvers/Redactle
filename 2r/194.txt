the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, also, called, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, or, the, fall, of, rome, was, the, loss, of, central, political, control, in, the, western, roman, empire, a, process, in, which, the, empire, failed, to, enforce, its, rule, and, its, vast, territory, was, divided, between, several, successor, polities, the, roman, empire, lost, the, strengths, that, had, allowed, it, to, exercise, effective, control, over, its, western, provinces, modern, historians, posit, factors, including, the, effectiveness, and, numbers, of, the, army, the, health, and, numbers, of, the, roman, population, the, strength, of, the, economy, the, competence, of, the, emperors, the, internal, struggles, for, power, the, religious, changes, of, the, period, and, the, efficiency, of, the, civil, administration, increasing, pressure, from, invading, barbarians, outside, roman, culture, also, contributed, greatly, to, the, collapse, climatic, changes, and, both, endemic, and, epidemic, disease, drove, many, of, these, immediate, factors, the, reasons, for, the, collapse, are, major, subjects, of, the, historiography, of, the, ancient, world, and, they, inform, much, modern, discourse, on, state, failure, in, 376, a, large, migration, of, goths, and, other, non, roman, people, fleeing, from, the, huns, entered, the, empire, roman, forces, were, unable, to, exterminate, expel, or, subjugate, them, as, was, their, normal, practice, in, 395, after, winning, two, destructive, civil, wars, theodosius, i, died, he, left, a, collapsing, field, army, and, the, empire, divided, between, the, warring, ministers, of, his, two, incapable, sons, goths, and, other, non, romans, became, a, force, that, could, challenge, either, part, of, the, empire, further, barbarian, groups, crossed, the, rhine, and, other, frontiers, the, armed, forces, of, the, western, empire, became, few, and, ineffective, and, despite, brief, recoveries, under, able, leaders, central, rule, was, never, again, effectively, consolidated, by, 476, the, position, of, western, roman, emperor, wielded, negligible, military, political, or, financial, power, and, had, no, effective, control, over, the, scattered, western, domains, that, could, still, be, described, as, roman, barbarian, kingdoms, had, established, their, own, power, in, much, of, the, area, of, the, western, empire, in, 476, the, germanic, barbarian, king, odoacer, deposed, the, last, emperor, of, the, western, roman, empire, in, italy, romulus, augustulus, and, the, senate, sent, the, imperial, insignia, to, the, eastern, roman, emperor, zeno, while, its, legitimacy, lasted, for, centuries, longer, and, its, cultural, influence, remains, today, the, western, empire, never, had, the, strength, to, rise, again, the, eastern, roman, or, byzantine, empire, survived, and, remained, for, centuries, an, effective, power, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, although, it, lessened, in, strength, additionally, while, the, loss, of, political, unity, and, military, control, is, universally, acknowledged, the, fall, of, rome, is, not, the, only, unifying, concept, for, these, events, the, period, described, as, late, antiquity, emphasizes, the, cultural, continuities, throughout, and, beyond, the, political, collapse, since, 1776, when, edward, gibbon, published, the, first, volume, of, his, the, history, of, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, decline, and, fall, has, been, the, theme, around, which, much, of, the, history, of, the, roman, empire, has, been, structured, from, the, eighteenth, century, onward, historian, glen, bowersock, wrote, we, have, been, obsessed, with, the, fall, it, has, been, valued, as, an, archetype, for, every, perceived, decline, and, hence, as, a, symbol, for, our, own, fears, from, at, least, the, time, of, henri, pirenne, 1862, 1935, scholars, have, described, a, continuity, of, roman, culture, and, political, legitimacy, long, after, 476, 5, 7, pirenne, postponed, the, demise, of, classical, civilization, to, the, 8th, century, he, challenged, the, notion, that, germanic, barbarians, had, caused, the, western, roman, empire, to, end, and, he, refused, to, equate, the, end, of, the, western, roman, empire, with, the, end, of, the, office, of, emperor, in, italy, he, pointed, out, the, essential, continuity, of, the, economy, of, the, roman, mediterranean, even, after, the, barbarian, invasions, and, suggested, that, only, the, muslim, conquests, represented, a, decisive, break, with, antiquity, the, more, recent, formulation, of, a, historical, period, characterized, as, late, antiquity, emphasizes, the, transformations, of, ancient, to, medieval, worlds, within, a, cultural, continuity, in, recent, decades, archaeologically, based, argument, even, extends, the, continuity, in, material, culture, and, in, patterns, of, settlement, as, late, as, the, eleventh, century, observing, the, political, reality, of, lost, control, and, the, attendant, fragmentation, of, commerce, culture, and, language, but, also, the, cultural, and, archaeological, continuities, the, process, has, been, described, as, a, complex, cultural, transformation, rather, than, a, fall, 34, the, perception, of, late, antiquity, has, significantly, changed, the, period, is, no, longer, seen, as, an, era, of, decline, and, crisis, but, as, an, epoch, of, metamorphosis, in, the, mediterranean, region, 3, 4, a, synthesis, by, harper, 2017, gave, four, decisive, turns, of, events, in, the, transformation, from, the, height, of, the, empire, to, the, early, middle, ages, the, loss, of, centralized, political, control, over, the, west, and, the, lessened, power, of, the, east, are, universally, agreed, but, the, theme, of, decline, has, been, taken, to, cover, a, much, wider, time, span, than, the, hundred, years, from, 376, for, cassius, dio, the, accession, of, the, emperor, commodus, in, 180, ce, marked, the, descent, from, a, kingdom, of, gold, to, one, of, rust, and, iron, since, the, age, of, humanism, the, process, of, the, fall, has, been, thought, to, have, begun, with, constantine, the, great, or, with, the, soldier, emperors, who, seized, power, through, command, of, the, army, from, 235, through, 284, or, with, commodus, or, even, with, augustus, gibbon, was, uncertain, about, when, decline, began, in, the, first, paragraph, of, his, text, gibbon, wrote, that, he, intended, to, trace, the, decline, from, the, golden, age, of, the, antonines, later, text, has, it, beginning, about, a, d, 180, with, the, death, of, marcus, aurelius, while, in, chapter, 7, he, pushes, the, start, of, the, decline, to, about, 52, b, c, the, time, of, julius, caesar, and, pompey, and, cicero, gibbon, placed, the, western, empire, s, end, with, the, removal, of, the, man, gibbon, referred, to, as, the, helpless, augustulus, in, 476, arnold, j, toynbee, and, james, burke, argue, that, the, entire, imperial, era, was, one, of, steady, decay, of, institutions, founded, in, republican, times, theodor, mommsen, excluded, the, imperial, period, from, his, nobel, prize, winning, history, of, rome, 1854, 1856, as, one, convenient, marker, for, the, end, 476, has, been, used, since, gibbon, but, other, key, dates, for, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, in, the, west, include, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, the, crossing, of, the, rhine, in, 406, or, 405, the, sack, of, rome, in, 410, and, the, death, of, julius, nepos, in, 480, when, gibbon, published, his, landmark, work, it, quickly, became, the, standard, peter, brown, has, written, that, gibbon, s, work, formed, the, peak, of, a, century, of, scholarship, which, had, been, conducted, in, the, belief, that, the, study, of, the, declining, roman, empire, was, also, the, study, of, the, origins, of, modern, europe, gibbon, was, the, first, to, attempt, an, explanation, of, causes, of, a, fall, of, empire, like, other, enlightenment, thinkers, and, british, citizens, of, the, age, steeped, in, institutional, anti, catholicism, gibbon, held, in, contempt, the, middle, ages, as, a, priest, ridden, superstitious, dark, age, it, was, not, until, his, own, era, the, age, of, reason, with, its, emphasis, on, rational, thought, it, was, believed, that, human, history, could, resume, its, progress, he, began, an, ongoing, controversy, about, the, role, of, christianity, but, he, gave, great, weight, to, other, causes, of, internal, decline, and, to, attacks, from, outside, the, empire, the, story, of, its, ruin, is, simple, and, obvious, and, instead, of, inquiring, why, the, roman, empire, was, destroyed, we, should, rather, be, surprised, that, it, had, subsisted, so, long, the, victorious, legions, who, in, distant, wars, acquired, the, vices, of, strangers, and, mercenaries, first, oppressed, the, freedom, of, the, republic, and, afterwards, violated, the, majesty, of, the, purple, the, emperors, anxious, for, their, personal, safety, and, the, public, peace, were, reduced, to, the, base, expedient, of, corrupting, the, discipline, which, rendered, them, alike, formidable, to, their, sovereign, and, to, the, enemy, the, vigour, of, the, military, government, was, relaxed, and, finally, dissolved, by, the, partial, institutions, of, constantine, and, the, roman, world, was, overwhelmed, by, a, deluge, of, barbarians, after, a, diligent, inquiry, i, can, discern, four, principal, causes, of, the, ruin, of, rome, which, continued, to, operate, in, a, period, of, more, than, a, thousand, years, i, the, injuries, of, time, and, nature, ii, the, hostile, attacks, of, the, barbarians, and, christians, iii, the, use, and, abuse, of, the, materials, and, iv, the, domestic, quarrels, of, the, romans, modern, historiography, diverges, from, gibbon, while, most, of, his, ideas, are, no, longer, accepted, in, totality, they, have, been, foundational, to, later, discourse, and, the, modern, synthesis, with, archaeology, epidemiology, climatic, history, genetic, science, and, many, more, new, sources, of, history, beyond, the, documentary, sources, that, were, all, that, was, available, to, gibbon, while, alexander, demandt, enumerated, 210, different, theories, on, why, rome, fell, twenty, first, century, scholarship, classifies, the, primary, possibilities, more, concisely, a, recent, summary, interprets, disease, and, climate, change, as, important, drivers, of, the, political, collapse, of, the, empire, there, was, a, roman, climatic, optimum, from, about, 200, bce, to, 150, ce, when, lands, around, the, mediterranean, were, generally, warm, and, well, watered, this, made, agriculture, prosperous, army, recruitment, easy, and, the, collection, of, taxes, straightforward, from, about, 150, the, climate, became, on, average, somewhat, worse, for, most, of, the, inhabited, lands, around, the, mediterranean, after, about, 450, the, climate, worsened, further, in, the, late, antique, little, ice, age, that, may, have, directly, contributed, to, the, variety, of, factors, that, brought, rome, down, the, roman, empire, was, built, on, the, fringes, of, the, tropics, its, roads, and, its, pirate, free, seas, which, produced, an, abundance, of, trade, also, unknowingly, created, an, interconnected, disease, ecology, that, unleashed, the, evolution, and, spread, of, pathogens, pandemics, contributed, to, massive, demographic, changes, economic, crises, and, food, shortages, in, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, heavy, mortality, in, 165, 180, from, the, antonine, plague, seriously, impaired, attempts, to, repel, germanic, invaders, but, the, legions, generally, held, or, at, least, speedily, re, instated, the, borders, of, the, empire, from, 376, massive, populations, moved, into, the, empire, driven, by, the, huns, who, themselves, may, have, been, driven, by, climate, change, in, the, eurasian, steppe, these, barbarian, invasions, led, ultimately, to, barbarian, kingdoms, over, much, of, the, former, territory, of, the, western, empire, but, the, final, blow, came, only, with, the, late, antique, little, ice, age, and, its, aftermath, when, rome, was, already, politically, fragmented, and, materially, depleted, aurelian, reunited, the, empire, in, 274, and, from, 284, diocletian, and, his, successors, reorganized, it, with, more, emphasis, on, the, military, john, the, lydian, writing, over, two, centuries, later, reported, that, diocletian, s, army, at, one, point, totaled, 389, 704, men, plus, 45, 562, in, the, fleets, and, numbers, may, have, increased, later, with, the, limited, communications, of, the, time, both, the, european, and, the, eastern, frontiers, needed, the, attention, of, their, own, supreme, commanders, diocletian, tried, to, solve, this, problem, by, re, establishing, an, adoptive, succession, with, a, senior, augustus, and, junior, caesar, emperor, in, each, half, of, the, empire, but, this, system, of, tetrarchy, broke, down, within, one, generation, and, the, hereditary, principle, re, established, itself, with, generally, unfortunate, results, thereafter, civil, war, became, again, the, main, method, of, establishing, new, imperial, regimes, although, constantine, the, great, in, office, 306, to, 337, again, re, united, the, empire, towards, the, end, of, the, fourth, century, the, need, for, division, was, generally, accepted, from, then, on, the, empire, existed, in, constant, tension, between, the, need, for, two, emperors, and, their, mutual, mistrust, until, late, in, the, fourth, century, the, united, empire, retained, sufficient, power, to, launch, powerful, attacks, against, its, enemies, in, germania, and, in, the, sasanian, empire, receptio, of, barbarians, became, widely, practised, imperial, authorities, admitted, potentially, hostile, groups, into, the, empire, split, them, up, and, allotted, to, them, lands, status, and, duties, within, the, imperial, system, in, this, way, many, groups, provided, unfree, workers, coloni, for, roman, landowners, and, recruits, laeti, for, the, roman, army, sometimes, their, leaders, became, officers, normally, the, romans, managed, the, process, carefully, with, sufficient, military, force, on, hand, to, ensure, compliance, cultural, assimilation, followed, over, the, next, generation, or, two, the, empire, suffered, multiple, serious, crises, during, the, third, century, the, rising, sassanid, empire, inflicted, three, crushing, defeats, on, roman, field, armies, and, remained, a, potent, threat, for, centuries, other, disasters, included, repeated, civil, wars, barbarian, invasions, and, more, mass, mortality, in, the, plague, of, cyprian, from, 250, onwards, for, a, short, period, the, empire, split, into, a, gallic, empire, in, the, west, 260, 274, a, palmyrene, empire, in, the, east, 260, 273, and, a, central, roman, rump, state, in, 271, rome, abandoned, the, province, of, dacia, on, the, north, of, the, danube, the, rhine, danube, frontier, also, came, under, more, effective, threats, from, larger, barbarian, groupings, which, had, developed, improved, agriculture, and, increased, their, populations, the, average, stature, of, the, population, in, the, west, suffered, a, serious, decline, in, the, late, second, century, the, population, of, northwestern, europe, did, not, recover, though, the, mediterranean, regions, did, the, empire, survived, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, directing, its, economy, successfully, towards, defense, but, survival, came, at, the, price, of, a, more, centralized, and, bureaucratic, state, excessive, military, expenditure, coupled, with, civil, wars, due, to, unstable, succession, caused, increased, taxes, to, the, detriment, of, the, industry, under, gallienus, emperor, from, 253, to, 268, the, senatorial, aristocracy, ceased, joining, the, ranks, of, the, senior, military, commanders, its, typical, members, lacked, interest, in, military, service, and, showed, incompetence, at, command, under, constantine, the, cities, lost, their, revenue, from, local, taxes, and, under, constantius, ii, r, 337, 361, their, endowments, of, property, this, worsened, the, existing, difficulty, in, keeping, the, city, councils, up, to, strength, and, the, services, provided, by, the, cities, were, scamped, or, abandoned, public, building, projects, had, declined, since, the, second, century, there, is, no, evidence, of, state, participation, in, or, support, for, restoration, and, maintenance, of, temples, and, shrines, restorations, were, funded, and, accomplished, privately, which, limited, what, was, done, 36, 39, a, further, financial, abuse, was, constantius, s, habit, of, granting, to, his, immediate, entourage, the, estates, of, persons, condemned, for, treason, and, other, capital, crimes, this, practice, reduced, future, though, not, immediate, income, those, close, to, the, emperor, also, gained, a, strong, incentive, to, encourage, his, suspicion, of, conspiracies, the, new, supreme, rulers, disposed, of, the, legal, fiction, of, the, early, empire, seeing, the, emperor, as, but, the, first, among, equals, emperors, from, aurelian, r, 270, 275, onwards, openly, styled, themselves, as, dominus, et, deus, lord, and, god, titles, appropriate, for, a, master, slave, relationship, an, elaborate, court, ceremonial, developed, and, obsequious, flattery, became, the, order, of, the, day, under, diocletian, the, flow, of, direct, requests, to, the, emperor, rapidly, reduced, and, soon, ceased, altogether, no, other, form, of, direct, access, replaced, them, and, the, emperor, received, only, information, filtered, through, his, courtiers, however, as, sabine, maccormack, described, the, court, culture, that, developed, with, diocletian, was, still, subject, to, pressure, from, below, imperial, proclamations, were, used, to, stress, the, traditional, limitations, of, the, imperial, office, while, imperial, ceremonies, left, room, for, consensus, and, popular, participation, official, cruelty, supporting, extortion, and, corruption, may, also, have, become, more, commonplace, one, example, being, constantine, s, law, that, slaves, who, betrayed, their, mistress, s, confidential, remarks, should, have, molten, lead, poured, down, their, throats, while, the, scale, complexity, and, violence, of, government, were, unmatched, the, emperors, lost, control, over, their, whole, realm, insofar, as, that, control, came, increasingly, to, be, wielded, by, anyone, who, paid, for, it, meanwhile, the, richest, senatorial, families, immune, from, most, taxation, engrossed, more, and, more, of, the, available, wealth, and, income, while, also, becoming, divorced, from, any, tradition, of, military, excellence, one, scholar, identifies, a, great, increase, in, the, purchasing, power, of, gold, two, and, a, half, fold, from, 274, to, the, later, fourth, century, this, may, be, an, index, of, growing, economic, inequality, between, a, gold, rich, elite, and, a, cash, poor, peasantry, formerly, says, ammianus, rome, was, saved, by, her, austerity, by, solidarity, between, rich, and, poor, by, contempt, for, death, now, she, is, undone, by, her, luxury, and, greed, amm, xxxi, 5, 14, and, xxii, 4, salvianus, backs, up, ammianus, by, affirming, that, greed, avaritia, is, a, vice, common, to, nearly, all, romans, however, lucius, calpurnius, piso, frugi, consul, 133, bc, had, already, dated, the, start, of, rome, s, moral, decline, to, 154, bce, within, the, late, roman, military, many, recruits, and, even, officers, had, barbarian, origins, soldiers, are, recorded, as, using, possibly, barbarian, rituals, such, as, elevating, a, claimant, on, shields, some, scholars, have, seen, this, as, an, indication, of, weakness, others, disagree, seeing, neither, barbarian, recruits, nor, new, rituals, as, causing, any, problem, with, the, effectiveness, or, loyalty, of, the, army, at, least, while, that, army, was, effectively, led, disciplined, trained, paid, and, supplied, by, officers, who, identified, as, roman, a, h, m, jones, has, pointed, out, that, the, earlier, scholarly, views, are, western, most, of, the, weaknesses, discussed, by, scholars, were, common, to, both, halves, of, the, empire, with, christianity, even, more, prevalent, in, the, east, than, the, west, religious, disputes, were, bitter, bureaucracy, corrupt, and, extortionate, it, had, a, caste, system, and, land, fell, out, of, use, in, the, east, just, as, it, had, in, the, west, yet, the, east, stood, its, ground, in, the, fifth, century, fought, back, in, the, sixth, and, even, recovered, some, territory, in, the, seventh, the, east, had, only, one, apparent, advantage, geography, it, was, less, vulnerable, strategically, than, the, west, the, narrowest, sea, crossing, to, its, core, territories, was, protected, from, the, northern, barbarians, by, the, fortifications, and, the, sea, and, land, forces, of, constantinople, while, the, european, frontier, from, the, mouth, of, the, rhine, to, that, of, the, danube, is, some, 2000, kilometres, great, circle, distance, and, could, be, crossed, with, much, less, difficulty, the, devastations, of, the, barbarians, impoverished, and, depopulated, the, frontier, provinces, and, their, unceasing, pressure, imposed, on, the, empire, a, burden, of, defense, which, overstrained, its, administrative, machinery, and, its, economic, resources, a, major, part, in, the, fall, of, the, west, the, roman, empire, reached, its, greatest, geographical, extent, under, trajan, r, 98, 117, who, ruled, a, prosperous, state, that, stretched, from, armenia, to, the, atlantic, ocean, the, empire, had, large, numbers, of, trained, supplied, and, disciplined, soldiers, drawn, from, a, growing, population, it, had, a, comprehensive, civil, administration, based, in, thriving, cities, with, effective, control, over, public, finances, the, literate, elite, considered, theirs, to, be, the, only, worthwhile, form, of, civilization, giving, the, empire, ideological, legitimacy, and, a, cultural, unity, based, on, comprehensive, familiarity, with, greek, and, roman, literature, and, rhetoric, the, empire, s, power, allowed, it, to, maintain, extreme, differences, of, wealth, and, status, its, wide, ranging, trade, networks, permitted, even, modest, households, to, use, goods, made, by, professionals, far, away, the, empire, had, both, strength, and, resilience, its, financial, system, allowed, it, to, raise, significant, taxes, which, despite, endemic, corruption, supported, a, large, regular, army, with, logistics, and, training, the, cursus, honorum, a, standardized, series, of, military, and, civil, posts, organised, for, ambitious, aristocratic, men, ensured, that, powerful, noblemen, had, the, opportunity, to, become, familiar, with, military, and, civil, command, and, administration, at, a, lower, level, within, the, army, connecting, the, aristocrats, at, the, top, with, the, private, soldiers, a, large, number, of, centurions, were, well, rewarded, literate, and, responsible, for, training, discipline, administration, and, leadership, in, battle, city, governments, with, their, own, properties, and, revenues, functioned, effectively, at, a, local, level, membership, of, city, councils, involved, lucrative, opportunities, for, independent, decision, making, and, despite, its, obligations, became, seen, as, a, privilege, under, a, series, of, emperors, who, each, adopted, a, mature, and, capable,

bishops, in, wealthy, cities, were, thus, able, to, offer, patronage, in, the, long, established, manner, of, roman, aristocrats, ammianus, described, some, who, enriched, from, the, offerings, of, matrons, ride, seated, in, carriages, wearing, clothing, chosen, with, care, and, serve, banquets, so, lavish, that, their, entertainments, outdo, the, tables, of, kings, but, the, move, to, christianity, probably, had, no, significant, effects, on, public, finances, the, large, temple, complexes, with, professional, full, time, priests, festivals, and, large, numbers, of, sacrifices, which, became, free, food, for, the, masses, had, also, been, expensive, to, maintain, they, had, already, been, negatively, impacted, by, the, empire, s, financial, struggles, in, the, third, century, 353, 60, the, numbers, of, clergy, monks, and, nuns, increased, to, perhaps, half, the, size, of, the, actual, army, and, they, have, been, considered, as, a, drain, on, limited, manpower, the, numbers, and, effectiveness, of, the, regular, soldiers, may, have, declined, during, the, fourth, century, payrolls, were, inflated, so, that, pay, could, be, diverted, and, exemptions, from, duty, sold, the, soldiers, opportunities, for, personal, extortion, were, multiplied, by, residence, in, cities, while, their, effectiveness, was, reduced, by, concentration, on, extortion, instead, of, military, exercises, however, extortion, gross, corruption, and, occasional, ineffectiveness, were, not, new, to, the, roman, army, there, is, no, consensus, whether, its, effectiveness, significantly, declined, before, 376, ammianus, marcellinus, himself, a, professional, soldier, repeats, longstanding, observations, about, the, superiority, of, contemporary, roman, armies, being, due, to, training, and, discipline, not, to, individual, size, or, strength, he, also, accuses, valentinian, i, of, being, the, first, emperor, to, increase, the, arrogance, of, the, military, raising, their, rank, and, power, to, excess, severely, punishing, the, minor, crimes, of, the, common, soldiers, while, sparing, those, of, higher, rank, who, felt, able, to, commit, shameful, and, monstrous, crimes, despite, a, possible, decrease, in, the, empire, s, ability, to, assemble, and, supply, large, armies, rome, maintained, an, aggressive, and, potent, stance, against, perceived, threats, almost, to, the, end, of, the, fourth, century, constantine, settled, franks, on, the, lower, left, bank, of, the, rhine, their, communities, required, a, line, of, fortifications, to, keep, them, in, check, indicating, that, rome, had, lost, almost, all, local, control, under, constantius, bandits, came, to, dominate, areas, such, as, isauria, which, were, well, within, the, empire, the, tribes, of, germania, also, became, more, populous, and, more, threatening, in, gaul, which, did, not, really, recover, from, the, invasions, of, the, third, century, there, was, widespread, insecurity, and, economic, decline, in, the, 300s, perhaps, worst, in, armorica, by, 350, after, decades, of, pirate, attacks, virtually, all, villas, in, armorica, were, deserted, local, use, of, money, ceased, around, 360, repeated, attempts, to, economize, on, military, expenditure, included, billeting, troops, in, cities, where, they, could, less, easily, be, kept, under, military, discipline, and, could, more, easily, extort, from, civilians, except, in, the, rare, case, of, a, determined, and, incorruptible, general, these, troops, proved, ineffective, in, action, and, dangerous, to, civilians, frontier, troops, were, often, given, land, rather, than, pay, as, they, farmed, for, themselves, their, direct, costs, diminished, but, so, did, their, effectiveness, and, their, pay, gave, much, less, stimulus, to, the, frontier, economy, however, except, for, the, provinces, along, the, lower, rhine, the, agricultural, economy, was, generally, doing, well, on, january, 18, 350, the, imperial, magister, officiorum, gave, a, banquet, in, augustodunum, while, his, master, western, emperor, constans, was, away, hunting, during, the, feast, magnus, magnentius, commander, of, the, imperial, household, troops, appeared, in, an, imperial, purple, toga, and, announced, himself, to, be, the, new, emperor, constans, was, soon, murdered, and, magnentius, took, over, most, of, his, western, domains, he, made, peace, overtures, to, constantius, in, the, east, but, these, failed, in, the, ensuing, bloody, civil, war, magnentius, marched, against, constantius, with, as, many, troops, as, he, could, mobilize, stripping, the, rhine, frontier, of, its, most, effective, troops, magnentius, died, and, so, did, many, of, his, men, meanwhile, constantius, sent, messages, to, the, german, tribes, east, of, the, rhine, inviting, them, to, attack, gaul, which, they, did, in, the, next, few, years, a, strip, some, 40, miles, wide, to, the, west, of, the, rhine, was, occupied, by, the, germans, and, a, further, 120, miles, into, gaul, the, surviving, population, and, garrisons, had, fled, julian, r, 360, 363, won, victories, against, germans, who, had, invaded, gaul, he, launched, a, drive, against, official, corruption, which, allowed, the, tax, demands, in, gaul, to, be, reduced, to, one, third, of, their, previous, amount, while, all, government, requirements, were, still, met, in, civil, legislation, julian, was, notable, for, his, pro, pagan, policies, julian, lifted, the, ban, on, sacrifices, restored, and, reopened, temples, and, dismantled, the, privileged, tax, status, and, revenue, concessions, of, the, christians, he, gave, generous, tax, remissions, to, the, cities, which, he, favored, and, disfavor, to, those, who, remained, christian, 62, 65, julian, ordered, toleration, of, varieties, of, christianity, banned, as, heretical, by, constantius, possibly, he, would, not, have, been, able, to, persecute, effectively, such, a, large, and, powerful, group, as, christians, had, now, become, 62, 345, 346, 62, julian, prepared, for, civil, war, against, constantius, who, again, encouraged, the, germans, to, attack, gaul, however, julian, s, campaigns, had, been, effective, and, only, one, small, alemannic, raid, speedily, dealt, with, by, julian, resulted, constantius, died, before, any, serious, fighting, and, julian, was, acknowledged, as, master, of, the, entire, empire, he, launched, an, expensive, campaign, against, the, sasanian, persians, he, succeeded, in, marching, to, the, sassanid, capital, of, ctesiphon, but, at, the, suggestion, of, a, persian, agent, burned, his, boats, and, supplies, to, show, resolve, in, continuing, operations, the, sassanids, then, burned, crops, so, the, roman, army, had, no, food, finding, himself, cut, off, without, supplies, in, enemy, territory, julian, began, a, land, retreat, and, during, the, battle, of, samarra, he, was, mortally, wounded, 74, julian, s, successor, jovian, acclaimed, by, a, demoralized, army, began, his, brief, reign, 363, 364, while, trapped, in, mesopotamia, without, supplies, to, purchase, safe, passage, home, he, had, to, concede, areas, of, northern, mesopotamia, including, the, strategically, important, fortress, of, nisibis, this, fortress, had, been, roman, since, before, the, peace, of, nisibis, in, 299, the, brothers, valens, r, 364, 378, and, valentinian, i, r, 364, 375, energetically, tackled, the, threats, of, barbarian, attacks, on, all, the, western, frontiers, they, also, tried, to, alleviate, the, burdens, of, taxation, which, had, risen, continuously, over, the, previous, forty, years, valens, in, the, east, reduced, the, tax, demand, by, half, in, his, fourth, year, both, of, them, were, christians, and, re, confiscated, the, temple, lands, which, julian, had, restored, but, they, were, generally, tolerant, of, other, beliefs, valentinian, in, the, west, refused, to, intervene, in, christian, controversy, in, the, east, valens, had, to, deal, with, christians, who, did, not, conform, to, his, ideas, of, orthodoxy, and, persecution, formed, part, of, his, response, he, tolerated, paganism, even, keeping, some, of, julian, s, associates, in, their, trusted, positions, he, confirmed, the, rights, and, privileges, of, the, pagan, priests, and, confirmed, the, right, of, pagans, to, be, the, exclusive, caretakers, of, their, temples, valentinian, died, of, an, apoplexy, while, shouting, at, envoys, of, germanic, leaders, his, successors, in, the, west, were, children, his, sons, gratian, r, 375, 383, and, valentinian, ii, r, 375, 392, gratian, alien, from, the, art, of, government, both, by, temperament, and, by, training, removed, the, altar, of, victory, from, the, senate, house, he, also, rejected, the, pagan, title, of, pontifex, maximus, in, 376, the, east, faced, an, enormous, barbarian, influx, across, the, danube, mostly, goths, who, were, fleeing, from, the, huns, they, were, exploited, by, corrupt, officials, rather, than, effectively, relieved, and, resettled, and, they, took, up, arms, and, were, joined, by, more, goths, and, some, alans, and, huns, valens, was, in, asia, with, his, main, field, army, preparing, for, an, assault, on, the, sasanian, empire, redirection, of, the, army, and, its, logistic, support, would, have, required, time, and, gratian, s, armies, were, distracted, by, germanic, invasions, across, the, rhine, in, 378, valens, attacked, the, invaders, with, the, eastern, field, army, now, perhaps, 20, 000, men, probably, much, fewer, than, the, forces, that, julian, had, led, into, mesopotamia, a, little, over, a, decade, before, and, possibly, only, 10, of, the, soldiers, nominally, available, in, the, danube, provinces, in, the, battle, of, adrianople, 9, august, 378, valens, lost, much, of, that, army, and, his, own, life, all, of, the, balkan, provinces, were, thus, exposed, to, raiding, without, effective, response, from, the, remaining, garrisons, who, were, more, easily, slaughtered, than, sheep, cities, were, able, to, hold, their, own, defensive, walls, against, barbarians, who, had, no, siege, equipment, therefore, the, cities, generally, remained, intact, although, the, countryside, suffered, gratian, appointed, a, new, augustus, a, proven, general, from, hispania, called, theodosius, during, the, next, four, years, he, partially, re, established, the, roman, position, in, the, east, these, campaigns, depended, on, effective, imperial, coordination, and, mutual, trust, between, 379, and, 380, theodosius, controlled, not, only, the, eastern, empire, but, also, by, agreement, the, diocese, of, illyricum, theodosius, was, unable, to, recruit, enough, roman, troops, relying, on, barbarian, warbands, without, roman, military, discipline, or, loyalty, in, contrast, during, the, cimbrian, war, the, roman, republic, controlling, a, smaller, area, than, the, western, empire, had, been, able, to, reconstitute, large, regular, armies, of, citizens, after, greater, defeats, than, adrianople, that, war, had, ended, with, the, near, extermination, of, the, invading, barbarian, supergroups, each, supposed, to, have, more, than, 100, 000, warriors, the, final, gothic, settlement, was, acclaimed, with, relief, even, the, official, panegyrist, admitting, that, these, goths, could, not, be, expelled, or, exterminated, nor, reduced, to, unfree, status, instead, they, were, either, recruited, into, the, imperial, forces, or, settled, in, the, devastated, provinces, along, the, south, bank, of, the, danube, where, the, regular, garrisons, were, never, fully, re, established, in, some, later, accounts, and, widely, in, recent, work, this, is, regarded, as, a, treaty, settlement, the, first, time, that, barbarians, were, given, a, home, within, the, empire, in, which, they, retained, their, political, and, military, cohesion, no, formal, treaty, is, recorded, nor, details, of, whatever, agreement, was, actually, made, when, the, goths, are, next, mentioned, in, roman, records, they, have, different, leaders, and, are, soldiers, of, a, sort, in, 391, alaric, a, gothic, leader, rebelled, against, roman, control, goths, attacked, the, emperor, himself, but, within, a, year, alaric, was, accepted, as, a, leader, of, theodosius, s, gothic, troops, and, this, rebellion, was, over, theodosius, s, financial, position, must, have, been, difficult, since, he, had, to, pay, for, expensive, campaigning, from, a, reduced, tax, base, the, business, of, subduing, barbarian, warbands, also, demanded, substantial, gifts, of, precious, metal, at, least, one, extra, levy, provoked, desperation, and, rioting, in, which, the, emperor, s, statues, were, destroyed, nevertheless, he, is, represented, as, financially, generous, as, emperor, though, frugal, in, his, personal, life, by, the, end, of, the, 380s, theodosius, and, the, court, were, in, mediolanum, and, northern, italy, was, experiencing, a, period, of, prosperity, for, the, great, landowners, who, took, advantage, of, the, court, s, need, for, food, turning, agrarian, produce, into, gold, while, repressing, and, misusing, the, poor, who, grew, it, and, brought, it, in, paulinus, the, deacon, notary, of, ambrose, the, bishop, of, milan, described, these, men, as, creating, a, court, where, everything, was, up, for, sale, ambrose, himself, preached, a, series, of, sermons, aimed, at, his, wealthy, constituents, asserting, that, avarice, leads, to, a, breakdown, in, society, for, centuries, theodosius, was, regarded, as, a, champion, of, christian, orthodoxy, who, decisively, stamped, out, paganism, his, predecessors, constantine, constantius, ii, and, valens, had, all, been, semi, arians, whereas, theodosius, supported, nicene, christianity, which, eventually, became, the, orthodox, version, of, christology, for, most, later, christian, churches, his, edict, of, thessalonica, described, arian, christians, as, foolish, madmen, therefore, as, far, as, ambrose, and, the, christian, literary, tradition, that, followed, him, were, concerned, theodosius, deserved, most, of, the, credit, for, the, final, triumph, of, christianity, modern, scholars, see, this, as, a, christian, interpretation, of, history, theodosius, did, not, stamp, out, paganism, which, continued, into, the, seventh, century, theodosius, had, to, face, a, powerful, usurper, in, the, west, magnus, maximus, declared, himself, emperor, in, 383, stripped, troops, from, the, outlying, regions, of, roman, britain, probably, replacing, some, with, federate, chieftains, and, their, war, bands, and, invaded, gaul, his, troops, killed, gratian, and, he, was, accepted, as, augustus, in, the, gallic, provinces, where, he, was, responsible, for, the, first, official, executions, of, christian, heretics, to, compensate, the, western, court, for, the, loss, of, gaul, hispania, and, britannia, theodosius, ceded, the, diocese, of, dacia, and, the, diocese, of, macedonia, to, their, control, in, 387, maximus, invaded, italy, forcing, valentinian, ii, to, flee, to, the, east, where, he, accepted, nicene, christianity, maximus, boasted, to, ambrose, of, the, numbers, of, barbarians, in, his, forces, and, hordes, of, goths, huns, and, alans, followed, theodosius, maximus, negotiated, with, theodosius, for, acceptance, as, augustus, of, the, west, but, theodosius, refused, gathered, his, armies, and, counterattacked, winning, the, civil, war, in, 388, there, were, heavy, troop, losses, on, both, sides, of, the, conflict, later, welsh, legend, has, maximus, s, defeated, troops, resettled, in, armorica, instead, of, returning, to, britannia, and, by, 400, armorica, was, controlled, by, bagaudae, rather, than, by, imperial, authority, theodosius, restored, valentinian, ii, still, a, very, young, man, as, augustus, in, the, west, he, also, appointed, arbogast, a, pagan, general, of, frankish, origin, as, valentinian, s, commander, in, chief, and, guardian, valentinian, quarreled, in, public, with, arbogast, failed, to, assert, any, authority, and, died, either, by, suicide, or, by, murder, at, the, age, of, 21, arbogast, and, theodosius, failed, to, come, to, terms, and, arbogast, nominated, an, imperial, official, eugenius, r, 392, 394, as, emperor, in, the, west, eugenius, made, some, modest, attempts, to, win, pagan, support, and, with, arbogast, led, a, large, army, to, fight, another, destructive, civil, war, they, were, defeated, and, killed, at, the, battle, of, the, frigidus, which, was, attended, by, further, heavy, losses, especially, among, the, gothic, federates, of, theodosius, the, north, eastern, approaches, to, italy, were, never, effectively, garrisoned, again, theodosius, died, a, few, months, later, in, early, 395, leaving, his, young, sons, honorius, r, 393, 423, and, arcadius, r, 383, 408, as, emperors, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, theodosius, s, death, the, magister, militum, stilicho, married, to, theodosius, s, niece, asserted, himself, in, the, west, as, the, guardian, of, honorius, and, commander, of, the, remains, of, the, defeated, western, army, he, also, claimed, control, over, arcadius, in, constantinople, but, rufinus, magister, officiorum, on, the, spot, had, already, established, his, own, power, there, henceforward, the, empire, was, not, under, the, control, of, one, man, until, much, of, the, west, had, been, permanently, lost, neither, honorius, nor, arcadius, ever, displayed, any, ability, either, as, rulers, or, as, generals, and, both, lived, as, the, puppet, rulers, of, their, courts, stilicho, tried, to, reunite, the, eastern, and, western, courts, under, his, personal, control, but, in, doing, so, achieved, only, the, continued, hostility, of, all, of, arcadius, s, successive, supreme, ministers, the, ineffectiveness, of, roman, military, responses, during, stilicho, s, rule, and, afterwards, has, been, described, as, shocking, there, is, little, evidence, of, indigenous, field, forces, or, of, adequate, training, discipline, pay, or, supply, for, the, barbarians, who, formed, most, of, the, available, troops, local, defence, was, occasionally, effective, but, was, often, associated, with, withdrawal, from, central, control, and, taxes, in, many, areas, barbarians, under, roman, authority, attacked, culturally, roman, bagaudae, the, fifth, century, western, emperors, with, brief, exceptions, were, individuals, incapable, of, ruling, effectively, or, even, of, controlling, their, own, courts, those, exceptions, were, responsible, for, brief, but, remarkable, resurgences, of, roman, power, corruption, in, this, context, the, diversion, of, finance, from, the, needs, of, the, army, may, have, contributed, greatly, to, the, fall, the, rich, senatorial, aristocrats, in, rome, itself, became, increasingly, influential, during, the, fifth, century, they, supported, armed, strength, in, theory, but, did, not, wish, to, pay, for, it, or, to, offer, their, own, workers, as, army, recruits, they, did, however, pass, large, amounts, of, money, to, the, christian, church, at, a, local, level, from, the, early, fourth, century, the, town, councils, lost, their, property, and, their, power, which, often, became, concentrated, in, the, hands, of, a, few, local, despots, beyond, the, reach, of, the, law, without, an, authoritative, ruler, the, balkan, provinces, fell, rapidly, into, disorder, alaric, was, disappointed, in, his, hopes, for, promotion, to, magister, militum, after, the, battle, of, the, frigidus, he, again, led, gothic, tribesmen, in, arms, and, established, himself, as, an, independent, power, burning, the, countryside, as, far, as, the, walls, of, constantinople, alaric, s, ambitions, for, long, term, roman, office, were, never, quite, acceptable, to, the, roman, imperial, courts, and, his, men, could, never, settle, long, enough, to, farm, in, any, one, area, they, showed, no, inclination, to, leave, the, empire, and, face, the, huns, from, whom, they, had, fled, in, 376, meanwhile, the, huns, were, still, stirring, up, further, migrations, with, migrating, tribes, often, attacking, the, roman, empire, in, turn, alaric, s, group, was, never, destroyed, nor, expelled, from, the, empire, nor, acculturated, under, effective, roman, domination, alaric, took, his, gothic, army, on, what, stilicho, s, propagandist, claudian, described, as, a, pillaging, campaign, that, began, first, in, the, east, alaric, s, forces, made, their, way, along, the, coast, to, athens, where, he, sought, to, force, a, new, peace, upon, the, romans, his, march, in, 396, passed, through, thermopylae, stilicho, sailed, from, italy, to, roman, greece, with, his, remaining, mobile, forces, posing, a, clear, threat, to, rufinus, s, control, of, the, eastern, empire, the, bulk, of, rufinus, s, forces, were, occupied, with, hunnic, incursions, in, asia, minor, and, syria, leaving, thracia, undefended, claudian, reports, that, only, stilicho, s, attack, stemmed, the, plundering, as, he, pushed, alaric, s, forces, north, into, epirus, burns, interpretation, is, that, alaric, and, his, men, had, been, recruited, by, rufinus, s, eastern, regime, and, sent, to, thessaly, to, stave, off, stilicho, s, threat, no, battle, took, place, zosimus, adds, that, stilicho, s, troops, destroyed, and, pillaged, too, and, let, alaric, s, men, escape, with, their, plunder, many, of, stilicho, s, eastern, forces, wanted, to, go, home, and, he, had, to, let, them, go, though, claudian, claims, that, he, did, so, willingly, some, went, to, constantinople, under, the, command, of, one, gainas, a, goth, with, a, large, gothic, following, on, arrival, gainas, murdered, rufinus, and, was, appointed, magister, militum, for, thrace, by, eutropius, the, new, supreme, minister, and, the, only, eunuch, consul, of, rome, eutropius, reportedly, controlled, arcadius, as, if, he, were, a, sheep, stilicho, obtained, a, few, more, troops, from, the, german, frontier, and, continued, to, campaign, ineffectively, against, the, eastern, empire, again, he, was, successfully, opposed, by, alaric, and, his, men, during, the, next, year, 397, eutropius, personally, led, his, troops, to, victory, over, some, huns, who, were, marauding, in, asia, minor, with, his, position, thus, strengthened, he, declared, stilicho, a, public, enemy, and, he, established, alaric, as, magister, militum, per, illyricum, a, poem, by, synesius, advises, the, emperor, to, display, manliness, and, remove, a, skin, clad, savage, probably, alaric, from, the, councils, of, power, and, his, barbarians, from, the, roman, army, we, do, not, know, if, arcadius, ever, became, aware, of, the, existence, of, this, advice, but, it, had, no, recorded, effect, synesius, from, a, province, suffering, the, widespread, ravages, of, a, few, poor, but, greedy, barbarians, also, complained, of, the, peacetime, war, one, almost, worse, than, the, barbarian, war, and, arising, from, military, indiscipline, and, the, officer, s, greed, the, magister, militum, in, the, diocese, of, africa, declared, for, the, east, and, stopped, the, supply, of, grain, to, rome, italy, had, not, fed, itself, for, centuries, and, could, not, do, so, now, in, 398, stilicho, sent, his, last, reserves, a, few, thousand, men, to, re, take, the, diocese, of, africa, he, strengthened, his, position, further, when, he, married, his, daughter, maria, to, honorius, throughout, this, period, stilicho, and, all, other, generals, were, desperately, short, of, recruits, and, supplies, for, them, in, 400, stilicho, was, charged, to, press, into, service, any, laetus, alamannus, sarmatian, vagrant, son, of, a, veteran, or, any, other, person, liable, to, serve, he, had, reached, the, bottom, of, his, recruitment, pool, though, personally, not, corrupt, he, was, very, active, in, confiscating, assets, the, financial, and, administrative, machine, was, not, producing, enough, support, for, the, army, in, 399, tribigild, s, rebellion, in, asia, minor, allowed, gainas, to, accumulate, a, significant, army, mostly, goths, become, supreme, in, the, eastern, court, and, execute, eutropius, he, now, felt, that, he, could, dispense, with, alaric, s, services, and, he, nominally, transferred, alaric, s, province, to, the, west, this, administrative, change, removed, alaric, s, roman, rank, and, his, entitlement, to, legal, provisioning, for, his, men, leaving, his, army, the, only, significant, force, in, the, ravaged, balkans, as, a, problem, for, stilicho, in, 400, the, citizens, of, constantinople, revolted, against, gainas, and, massacred, as, many, of, his, people, soldiers, and, their, families, as, they, could, catch, some, goths, at, least, built, rafts, and, tried, to, cross, the, strip, of, sea, that, separates, asia, from, europe, the, roman, navy, slaughtered, them, by, the, beginning, of, 401, gainas, head, rode, a, pike, through, constantinople, while, another, gothic, general, became, consul, meanwhile, groups, of, huns, started, a, series, of, attacks, across, the, danube, and, the, isaurians, marauded, far, and, wide, in, anatolia, in, 401, stilicho, travelled, over, the, alps, to, raetia, to, scrape, up, further, troops, he, left, the, rhine, defended, only, by, the, dread, of, roman, retaliation, rather, than, by, adequate, forces, able, to, take, the, field, early, in, spring, alaric, probably, desperate, invaded, italy, and, he, drove, honorius, westward, from, mediolanum, besieging, him, in, hasta, pompeia, in, liguria, stilicho, returned, as, soon, as, the, passes, had, cleared, meeting, alaric, in, two, battles, near, pollentia, and, verona, without, decisive, results, the, goths, weakened, were, allowed, to, retreat, back, to, illyricum, where, the, western, court, again, gave, alaric, office, though, only, as, comes, and, only, over, dalmatia, and, pannonia, secunda, rather, than, the, whole, of, illyricum, stilicho, probably, supposed, that, this, pact, would, allow, him, to, put, italian, government, into, order, and, recruit, fresh, troops, he, may, also, have, planned, with, alaric, s, help, to, relaunch, his, attempts, to, gain, control, over, the, eastern, court, however, in, 405, stilicho, was, distracted, by, a, fresh, invasion, of, northern, italy, another, group, of, goths, fleeing, the, huns, led, by, one, radagaisus, started, the, war, of, radagaisus, and, devastated, the, north, of, italy, for, six, months, before, stilicho, could, muster, enough, forces, to, take, the, field, against, them, stilicho, recalled, troops, from, britannia, and, the, depth, of, the, crisis, was, shown, when, he, urged, all, roman, soldiers, to, allow, their, personal, slaves, to, fight, beside, them, his, forces, including, huns, and, alans, may, in, the, end, have, totalled, rather, less, than, 15, 000, men, radagaisus, was, defeated, and, executed, while, 12, 000, prisoners, from, the, defeated, horde, were, drafted, into, stilicho, s, service, stilicho, continued, negotiations, with, alaric, flavius, aetius, son, of, one, of, stilicho, s, major, supporters, was, sent, as, a, hostage, to, alaric, in, 405, in, 406, stilicho, heard, of, new, invaders, and, rebels, who, had, appeared, in, the, northern, provinces, he, insisted, on, making, peace, with, alaric, probably, on, the, basis, that, alaric, would, prepare, to, move, either, against, the, eastern, court, or, against, the, rebels, in, gaul, the, senate, deeply, resented, peace, with, alaric, in, 407, alaric, marched, into, noricum, and, demanded, a, large, payment, for, his, expensive, efforts, in, stilicho, s, interests, the, senate, inspired, by, the, courage, rather, than, the, wisdom, of, their, predecessors, preferred, war, one, senator, famously, declaimed, non, est, ista, pax, sed, pactio, servitutis, this, is, not, peace, but, a, pact, of, servitude, stilicho, paid, alaric, four, thousand, pounds, of, gold, nevertheless, stilicho, sent, sarus, a, gothic, general, over, the, alps, to, face, the, usurper, constantine, iii, sarus, lost, this, campaign, and, barely, escaped, having, to, leave, his, baggage, to, the, bandits, who, now, infested, the, alpine, passes, the, empress, maria, daughter, of, stilicho, died, in, 407, or, early, 408, and, her, sister, aemilia, materna, thermantia, married, honorius, in, the, east, arcadius, died, on, 1, may, 408, and, was, replaced, by, his, son, theodosius, ii, stilicho, seems, to, have, planned, to, march, to, constantinople, and, to, install, there, a, regime, loyal, to, himself, he, may, also, have, intended, to, give, alaric, a, senior, official, position, and, to, send, him, against, the, rebels, in, gaul, before, he, could, do, so, while, he, was, away, at, ticinum, at, the, head, of, a, small, detachment, a, bloody, coup, d, tat, against, his, supporters, took, place, at, honorius, s, court, it, was, led, by, stilicho, s, own, creature, one, olympius, stilicho, had, news, of, the, coup, at, bononia, where, he, was, probably, waiting, for, alaric, his, army, of, barbarian, troops, including, a, guard, of, huns, and, many, goths, under, sarus, discussed, attacking, the, forces, of, the, coup, but, stilicho, prevented, them, when, he, heard, that, the, emperor, had, not, been, harmed, sarus, s, gothic, troops, then, massacred, the, hun, contingent, in, their, sleep, and, stilicho, withdrew, from, the, quarreling, remains, of, his, army, to, ravenna, he, ordered, that, his, former, soldiers, should, not, be, admitted, into, the, cities, in, which, their, families, were, billeted, stilicho, was, forced, to, flee, to, a, church, for, sanctuary, promised, his, life, and, killed, alaric, was, again, declared, an, enemy, of, the, emperor, the, conspiracy, then, massacred, the, families, of, the, federate, troops, as, presumed, supporters, of, stilicho, although, they, had, probably, rebelled, against, him, and, the, troops, defected, en, masse, to, alaric, the, conspirators, seem, to, have, let, their, main, army, disintegrate, and, had, no, policy, except, hunting, down, anyone, they, regarded, as, supporters, of, stilicho, italy, was, left, without, effective, indigenous, defence, forces, thereafter, heraclianus, a, co, conspirator, of, olympius, became, governor, of, the, diocese, of, africa, he, consequently, controlled, the, source, of, most, of, italy, s, grain, and, he, supplied, food, only, in, the, interests, of, honorius, s, regime, as, a, declared, enemy, of, the, emperor, alaric, was, denied, the, legitimacy, that, he, needed, to, collect, taxes, and, hold, cities, without, large, garrisons, which, he, could, not, afford, to, detach, he, again, offered, to, move, his, men, this, time, to, pannonia, in, exchange, for, a, modest, sum, of, money, and, the, modest, title, of, comes, he, was, refused, as, olympius, s, clique, still, regarded, him, as, a, supporter, of, stilicho, he, moved, into, italy, probably, using, the, route, and, supplies, arranged, for, him, by, stilicho, bypassing, the, imperial, court, in, ravenna, which, was, protected, by, widespread, marshland, and, had, a, port, and, he, menaced, the, city, of, rome, itself, in, 407, there, was, no, equivalent, of, the, determined, response, to, the, catastrophic, battle, of, cannae, in, 216, bce, when, the, entire, roman, population, even, slaves, had, been, mobilized, to, resist, the, enemy, alaric, s, military, operations, centred, on, the, port, of, rome, through, which, rome, s, grain, supply, had, to, pass, alaric, s, first, siege, of, rome, in, 408, caused, dreadful, famine, within, the, walls, it, was, ended, by, a, payment, that, though, large, was, less, than, one, of, the, richest, senators, could, have, produced, the, super, rich, aristocrats, made, little, contribution, pagan, temples, were, stripped, of, ornaments, to, make, up, the, total, with, promises, of, freedom, alaric, also, recruited, many, of, the, slaves, in, rome, alaric, withdrew, to, tuscany, and, recruited, more, slaves, athaulf, a, goth, nominally, in, roman, service, and, brother, in, law, to, alaric, marched, through, italy, to, join, alaric, a, small, force, of, hunnic, mercenaries, led, by, olympius, killed, some, of, athaulf, s, men, on, this, journey, sarus, was, an, enemy, of, athaulf, and, on, athaulf, s, arrival, went, back, into, imperial, service, in, 409, olympius, fell, to, further, intrigue, having, his, ears, cut, off, before, he, was, beaten, to, death, alaric, tried, again, to, negotiate, with, honorius, but, his, demands, now, even, more, moderate, only, frontier, land, and, food, were, inflated, by, the, messenger, and, honorius, responded, with, insults, which, were, reported, verbatim, to, alaric, he, broke, off, negotiations, and, the, standoff, continued, honorius, s, court, made, overtures, to, the, usurper, constantine, iii, in, gaul, and, arranged, to, bring, hunnic, forces, into, italy, alaric, ravaged, italy, outside, the, fortified, cities, which, he, could, not, garrison, and, the, romans, refused, open, battle, for, which, they, had, inadequate, forces, late, in, the, year, alaric, sent, bishops, to, express, his, readiness, to, leave, italy, if, honorius, would, only, grant, his, people, a, supply, of, grain, honorius, sensing, weakness, flatly, refused, alaric, moved, to, rome, and, captured, galla, placidia, sister, of, honorius, the, senate, in, rome, despite, its, loathing, for, alaric, was, now, desperate, enough, to, give, him, almost, anything, he, wanted, they, had, no, food, to, offer, but, they, tried, to, give, him, imperial, legitimacy, with, the, senate, s, acquiescence, he, elevated, priscus, attalus, as, his, puppet, emperor, and, he, marched, on, ravenna, honorius, was, planning, to, flee, to, constantinople, when, a, reinforcing, army, of, 4, 000, soldiers, from, the, east, disembarked, in, ravenna, these, garrisoned, the, walls, and, honorius, held, on, he, had, constantine, s, principal, court, supporter, executed, and, constantine, abandoned, plans, to, march, to, honorius, s, defence, attalus, failed, to, establish, his, control, over, the, diocese, of, africa, and, no, grain, arrived, in, rome, where, the, famine, became, even, more, frightful, jerome, reports, cannibalism, within, the, walls, attalus, brought, alaric, no, real, advantage, failing, also, to, come, to, any, useful, agreement, with, honorius, to, whom, attalus, offered, mutilation, humiliation, and, exile, indeed, attalus, s, claim, was, a, marker, of, threat, to, honorius, and, alaric, dethroned, him, after, a, few, months, in, 410, alaric, took, rome, by, starvation, and, sacked, it, for, three, days, he, invited, its, remaining, barbarian, slaves, to, join, him, which, many, did, there, was, relatively, little, destruction, in, some, christian, holy, places, alaric, s, men, even, refrained, from, wanton, violence, and, jerome, tells, the, story, of, a, virgin, who, was, escorted, to, a, church, by, the, invaders, after, they, had, given, her, mother, a, beating, from, which, she, later, died, the, city, of, rome, was, the, seat, of, the, richest, senatorial, noble, families, and, the, centre, of, their, cultural, patronage, to, pagans, it, was, the, sacred, origin, of, the, empire, and, to, christians, the, seat, of, the, heir, of, saint, peter, at, the, time, this, position, was, held, by, pope, innocent, i, the, most, authoritative, bishop, of, the, west, rome, had, not, fallen, to, an, enemy, since, the, battle, of, the, allia, over, eight, centuries, before, refugees, spread, the, news, and, their, stories, throughout, the, empire, and, the, meaning, of, the, fall, was, debated, with, religious, fervour, both, christians, and, pagans, wrote, embittered, tracts, blaming, paganism, or, christianity, respectively, for, the, loss, of, rome, s, supernatural, protection, and, all, attacking, stilicho, s, earthly, failures, some, christian, responses, anticipated, the, imminence, of, the, last, judgment, augustine, of, hippo, in, his, book, city, of, god, ultimately, rejected, the, pagan, and, christian, idea, that, religion, should, have, worldly, benefits, he, instead, developed, the, doctrine, that, the, city, of, god, in, heaven, undamaged, by, mundane, disasters, was, the, true, objective, of, christians, more, practically, honorius, was, briefly, persuaded, to, set, aside, the, laws, forbidding, pagans, to, be, military, officers, so, that, one, generidus, could, re, establish, roman, control, in, dalmatia, generidus, did, this, with, unusual, effectiveness, his, techniques, were, remarkable, for, this, period, in, that, they, included, training, his, troops, disciplining, them, and, giving, them, appropriate, supplies, even, if, he, had, to, use, his, own, money, the, penal, laws, were, reinstated, no, later, than, 25, august, 410, meaning, that, the, overall, trend, of, repression, of, paganism, continued, procopius, mentions, a, story, in, which, honorius, on, hearing, the, news, that, rome, had, perished, was, shocked, the, emperor, thought, that, the, news, was, in, reference, to, his, favorite, chicken, which, he, had, named, roma, on, hearing, that, rome, itself, had, fallen, he, breathed, a, sigh, of, relief, at, that, time, they, say, that, the, emperor, honorius, in, ravenna, received, the, message, from, one, of, the, eunuchs, evidently, a, keeper, of, the, poultry, that, roma, had, perished, and, he, cried, out, and, said, and, yet, it, has, just, eaten, from, my, hands, for, he, had, a, very, large, cockerel, roma, by, name, and, the, eunuch, comprehending, his, words, said, that, it, was, the, city, of, roma, which, had, perished, at, the, hands, of, alaric, and, the, emperor, with, a, sigh, of, relief, answered, quickly, but, i, thought, that, my, fowl, roma, had, perished, so, great, they, say, was, the, folly, with, which, this, emperor, was, possessed, alaric, then, moved, south, intending, to, sail, to, africa, his, ships, were, wrecked, in, a, storm, and, he, shortly, died, of, fever, his, successor, athaulf, still, regarded, as, an, usurper, and, given, only, occasional, and, short, term, grants, of, supplies, moved, north, into, the, turmoil, of,

they, may, have, been, trying, to, get, away, from, the, huns, who, about, this, time, advanced, to, occupy, the, great, hungarian, plain, for, the, next, few, years, these, barbarian, tribes, wandered, in, search, of, food, and, employment, while, roman, forces, fought, each, other, in, the, name, of, honorius, and, a, number, of, competing, claimants, to, the, imperial, throne, the,

to, hispania, where, he, may, have, settled, the, sueves, and, the, asding, vandals, gerontius, then, fell, out, with, his, master, and, elevated, one, maximus, as, his, own, puppet, emperor, he, defeated, constantine, and, was, besieging, him, in, arelate, when, honorius, s, general, constantius, arrived, from, italy, with, an, army, possibly, composed, mainly, of, hun, mercenaries, gerontius, s, troops, deserted, him, and, he, committed, suicide, constantius, continued, the, siege, defeating, a, relieving, army, constantine, surrendered, in, 411, with, a, promise, that, his, life, would, be, spared, and, was, then, executed, in, 410, the, roman, civitates, of, britannia, rebelled, against, constantine, and, evicted, his, officials, they, asked, for, help, from, honorius, who, replied, that, they, should, look, to, their, own, defence, while, the, british, may, have, regarded, themselves, as, roman, for, several, generations, and, british, armies, may, at, times, have,

at, the, wedding, included, attalus, a, puppet, emperor, without, revenues, or, soldiers, athaulf, famously, declared, that, he, had, abandoned, his, intention, to, set, up, a, gothic, empire, because, of, the, irredeemable, barbarity, of, his, followers, and, instead, he, sought, to, restore, the, roman, empire, he, handed, attalus, over, to, honorius, s, regime, for, mutilation,

were, united, under, the, able, ferocious, and, long, lived, king, genseric, he, moved, his, entire, people, to, tarifa, near, gibraltar, divided, them, into, 80, groups, nominally, of, 1, 000, people, perhaps, 20, 000, warriors, in, total, and, crossed, from, hispania, to, mauretania, without, opposition, they, spent, a, year, moving, slowly, to, numidia, defeating, boniface, he, returned, to, italy, where, aetius, had, recently, had, felix, executed, boniface, was, promoted, to, magister, militum, and, earned, the, enmity, of, aetius, who, may, have, been, absent, in, gaul, at, the, time, in, 432, the, two, met, at, the, battle, of, ravenna, which, left, aetius, s, forces, defeated, and, boniface, mortally, wounded, aetius, temporarily, retired, to, his, estates, but, after, an, attempt, to, murder, him, he, raised, another, hunnic, army, probably, by, conceding, parts, of, pannonia, to, them, and, in, 433, he, returned, to, italy, overcoming, all, rivals, he, never, threatened, to, become, an, augustus, himself, and, thus, maintained, the, support, of, the, eastern, court, where, valentinian, s, cousin, theodosius, ii, reigned, until, 450, aetius, campaigned, vigorously, somewhat, stabilizing, the, situation, in, gaul, and, in, hispania, he, relied, heavily, on, his, forces, of, huns, with, a, ferocity, celebrated, centuries, later, in, the, nibelungenlied, the, huns, slaughtered, many, burgundiones, on, the, middle, rhine, re, establishing, the, survivors, as, roman, allies, the, first, kingdom, of, the, burgundians, this, may, have, returned, some, sort, of, roman, authority, to, trier, eastern, troops, reinforced, carthage, temporarily, halting, the, vandals, who, in, 435, agreed, to, limit, themselves, to, numidia, and, leave, the, most, fertile, parts, of, north, africa, in, peace, aetius, concentrated, his, limited, military, resources, to, defeat, the, visigoths, again, and, his, diplomacy, restored, a, degree, of, order, to, hispania, however, his, general, litorius, was, badly, defeated, by, the, visigoths, at, toulouse, and, a, new, suevic, king, rechiar, began, vigorous, assaults, on, what, remained, of, roman, hispania, at, one, point, rechiar, even, allied, with, bagaudae, these, were, romans, not, under, imperial, control, some, of, their, reasons, for, rebellion, may, be, indicated, by, the, remarks, of, a, roman, captive, under, attila, who, was, happy, in, his, lot, giving, a, lively, account, of, the, vices, of, a, declining, empire, of, which, he, had, so, long, been, the, victim, the, cruel, absurdity, of, the, roman, princes, unable, to, protect, their, subjects, against, the, public, enemy, unwilling, to, trust, them, with, arms, for, their, own, defence, the, intolerable, weight, of, taxes, rendered, still, more, oppressive, by, the, intricate, or, arbitrary, modes, of, collection, the, obscurity, of, numerous, and, contradictory, laws, the, tedious, and, expensive, forms, of, judicial, proceedings, the, partial, administration, of, justice, and, the, universal, corruption, which, increased, the, influence, of, the, rich, and, aggravated, the, misfortunes, of, the, poor, vegetius, s, advice, on, re, forming, an, effective, army, may, be, dated, to, the, early, 430s, though, a, date, in, the, 390s, has, also, been, suggested, he, identified, many, deficiencies, in, the, military, especially, mentioning, that, the, soldiers, were, no, longer, properly, equipped, from, the, foundation, of, the, city, till, the, reign, of, the, emperor, gratian, the, foot, wore, cuirasses, and, helmets, but, negligence, and, sloth, having, by, degrees, introduced, a, total, relaxation, of, discipline, the, soldiers, began, to, think, their, armor, too, heavy, as, they, seldom, put, it, on, they, first, requested, leave, from, the, emperor, to, lay, aside, the, cuirass, and, afterwards, the, helmet, in, consequence, of, this, our, troops, in, their, engagements, with, the, goths, were, often, overwhelmed, with, their, showers, of, arrows, nor, was, the, necessity, of, obliging, the, infantry, to, resume, their, cuirasses, and, helmets, discovered, notwithstanding, such, repeated, defeats, which, brought, on, the, destruction, of, so, many, great, cities, troops, defenseless, and, exposed, to, all, the, weapons, of, the, enemy, are, more, disposed, to, fly, than, fight, what, can, be, expected, from, a, foot, archer, without, cuirass, or, helmet, who, cannot, hold, at, once, his, bow, and, shield, or, from, the, ensigns, whose, bodies, are, naked, and, who, cannot, at, the, same, time, carry, a, shield, and, the, colors, the, foot, soldier, finds, the, weight, of, a, cuirass, and, even, of, a, helmet, intolerable, this, is, because, he, is, so, seldom, exercised, and, rarely, puts, them, on, a, religious, polemic, of, about, this, time, complains, bitterly, of, the, oppression, and, extortion, suffered, by, all, but, the, richest, romans, many, wished, to, flee, to, the, bagaudae, or, even, to, foul, smelling, barbarians, although, these, men, differ, in, customs, and, language, from, those, with, whom, they, have, taken, refuge, and, are, unaccustomed, too, if, i, may, say, so, to, the, nauseous, odor, of, the, bodies, and, clothing, of, the, barbarians, yet, they, prefer, the, strange, life, they, find, there, to, the, injustice, rife, among, the, romans, so, you, find, men, passing, over, everywhere, now, to, the, goths, now, to, the, bagaudae, or, whatever, other, barbarians, have, established, their, power, anywhere, we, call, those, men, rebels, and, utterly, abandoned, whom, we, ourselves, have, forced, into, crime, for, by, what, other, causes, were, they, made, bagaudae, save, by, our, unjust, acts, the, wicked, decisions, of, the, magistrates, the, proscription, and, extortion, of, those, who, have, turned, the, public, exactions, to, the, increase, of, their, private, fortunes, and, made, the, tax, indictions, their, opportunity, for, plunder, gildas, a, 6th, century, monk, and, author, of, de, excidio, et, conquestu, britanniae, wrote, that, in, the, respite, from, devastation, the, island, was, so, flooded, with, abundance, of, goods, that, no, previous, age, had, known, the, like, of, it, alongside, there, grew, luxury, nevertheless, effective, imperial, protection, from, barbarian, ravages, was, eagerly, sought, about, this, time, authorities, in, britannia, asked, aetius, for, help, to, aetius, thrice, consul, the, groans, of, the, british, further, on, came, this, complaint, the, barbarians, push, us, back, to, the, sea, the, sea, pushes, us, back, to, the, barbarians, between, these, two, kinds, of, death, we, are, either, drowned, or, slaughtered, but, they, got, no, help, in, return, the, visigoths, passed, another, waymark, on, their, journey, to, full, independence, they, made, their, own, foreign, policy, sending, princesses, to, make, rather, unsuccessful, marriage, alliances, with, rechiar, of, the, sueves, and, with, huneric, son, of, the, vandal, king, genseric, in, 439, the, vandals, moved, eastward, temporarily, abandoning, numidia, they, captured, carthage, where, they, established, the, vandal, kingdom, an, independent, state, with, a, powerful, navy, this, brought, immediate, financial, crisis, to, the, western, empire, the, diocese, of, africa, was, prosperous, normally, required, few, troops, to, keep, it, secure, contributed, large, tax, revenues, and, exported, wheat, to, feed, rome, and, many, other, areas, roman, troops, assembled, in, sicily, but, the, planned, counter, attack, never, happened, huns, attacked, the, eastern, empire, and, the, troops, which, had, been, sent, against, genseric, were, hastily, recalled, from, sicily, the, garrisons, on, the, side, of, persia, were, exhausted, and, a, military, force, was, collected, in, europe, formidable, by, their, arms, and, numbers, if, the, generals, had, understood, the, science, of, command, and, the, soldiers, the, duty, of, obedience, the, armies, of, the, eastern, empire, were, vanquished, in, three, successive, engagements, from, the, hellespont, to, thermopylae, and, the, suburbs, of, constantinople, ravaged, without, resistance, and, without, mercy, the, provinces, of, thrace, and, macedonia, attila, s, invasions, of, the, east, were, stopped, by, the, theodosian, walls, at, this, heavily, fortified, eastern, end, of, the, mediterranean, there, were, no, significant, barbarian, invasions, across, the, sea, into, the, rich, southerly, areas, of, anatolia, the, levant, and, egypt, despite, internal, and, external, threats, and, more, religious, discord, than, the, west, these, provinces,

conjoined, valentinianic, and, theodosian, dynasties, huneric, s, gothic, wife, was, suspected, of, trying, to, poison, her, father, in, law, genseric, he, sent, her, home, without, her, nose, or, ears, and, his, gothic, alliance, came, to, an, early, end, the, romans, regained, numidia, and, rome, again, received, a, grain, supply, from, africa, the, losses, of, income, from, the, diocese, of, africa, were, equivalent, to, the, costs, of, nearly, 40, 000, infantry, or, over, 20, 000, cavalry, the, imperial, regime, had, to, increase, taxes, despite, admitting, that, the, peasantry, could, pay, no, more, and, that, a, sufficient, army, could, not, be, raised, the, imperial, regime, protected, the, interests, of, landowners, displaced, from, africa, and, allowed, wealthy, individuals, to, avoid, taxes, in, 444, the, huns, were, united, under, attila, his, subjects, included, huns, outnumbered, several, times, over, by, other, groups, predominantly, germanic, peoples, his, power, rested, partly, on, his, continued, ability, to, reward, his, favoured, followers, with, precious, metals, and, he, continued, to, attack, the, eastern, empire, until, 450, by, when, he, had, extracted, vast, sums, of, money, and, many, other, concessions, attila, may, not, have, needed, any, excuse, to, turn, west, but, he, received, one, in, the, form, of, a, plea, for, help, from, honoria, the, emperor, s, sister, who, was, being, forced, into, a, marriage, which, she, resented, attila, claimed, honoria, as, his, wife, and, half, of, the, western, empire, s, territory, as, his, dowry, faced, with, refusal, he, invaded, gaul, in, 451, with, a, huge, army, in, the, bloody, battle, of, the, catalaunian, plains, the, invasion, was, stopped, by, the, combined, forces, of, the, barbarians, within, the, western, empire, they, were, coordinated, by, aetius, and, supported, by, what, troops, he, could, muster, the, next, year, attila, invaded, italy, and, proceeded, to, march,

without, adequate, forces, the, barbarians, inflicted, haphazard, extortion, murder, kidnap, and, plunder, on, the, romans, and, on, each, other, so, long, as, the, roman, dominion, lasted, soldiers, were, maintained, in, many, towns, at, the, public, expense, to, guard, the, boundary, wall, when, this, custom, ceased, the, squadrons, of, soldiers, and, the, boundary, wall, were, blotted, out, together, the, troop, at, batavis, however, held, out, some, soldiers, of, this, troop, had, gone, to, italy, to, fetch, the, final, pay, to, their, comrades, and, no, one, knew, that, the, barbarians, had, slain, them, on, the, way, in, 454, aetius, was, personally, stabbed, to, death, by, valentinian, thought, he, had, slain, his, master, he, found, that, he, had, slain, his, protector, and, he, fell, a, helpless, victim, to, the, first, conspiracy, which, was, hatched, against, his, throne, valentinian, himself, was, murdered, by, the, dead, general, s, supporters, a, year, later, a, rich, senatorial, aristocrat, petronius, maximus, who, had, encouraged, both, murders, then, seized, the, throne, he, broke, the, engagement, between, the, princess, eudocia, and, huneric, heir, to, the, vandal, throne, this, amounted, to, a, declaration, of, war, with, the, vandals, petronius, had, time, to, send, avitus, to, ask, for, the, help, of, the, visigoths, in, gaul, before, a, vandal, fleet, arrived, in, italy, petronius, was, unable, to, muster, any, effective, defence, tried, to, flee, the, city, and, was, torn, to, pieces, by, a, mob, who, paraded, the, bits, around, on, a, pole, the, vandals, entered, rome, and, plundered, it, for, two, weeks, despite, the, shortage, of, money, for, the, defence, of, the, state, considerable, private, wealth, had, accumulated, since, the, previous, sack, in, 410, the, vandals, sailed, away, with, large, amounts, of, treasure, and, also, with, the, princess, eudocia, she, became, the, wife, of, one, vandal, king, and, the, mother, of, another, hilderic, the, vandals, conquered, sicily, their, fleet, became, a, constant, danger, to, roman, sea, trade, and, to, the, coasts, and, islands, of, the, western, mediterranean, avitus, at, the, visigothic, court, in, burdigala, declared, himself, emperor, he, moved, on, rome, with, visigothic, support, he, gained, acceptance, by, majorian, and, ricimer, commanders, of, the, remaining, army, of, italy, this, was, the, first, time, that, a, barbarian, kingdom, had, played, a, key, role, in, the, imperial, succession, avitus, s, son, in, law, sidonius, apollinaris, wrote, propaganda, to, present, the, visigothic, king, theoderic, ii, as, a, reasonable, man, with, whom, a, roman, regime, could, do, business, theoderic, s, payoff, included, precious, metal, from, stripping, the, remaining, public, ornaments, of, italy, and, an, unsupervised, campaign, in, hispania, there, he, not, only, defeated, the, sueves, executing, his, brother, in, law, rechiar, but, he, also, plundered, roman, cities, the, burgundians, expanded, their, kingdom, in, the, rh, ne, valley, while, the, vandals, took, the, remains, of, the, diocese, of, africa, in, 456, the, visigothic, army, was, too, heavily, engaged, in, hispania, to, be, an, effective, threat, to, italy, ricimer, had, just, destroyed, a, pirate, fleet, of, sixty, vandal, ships, majorian, and, ricimer, marched, against, avitus, and, defeated, him, near, placentia, he, was, forced, to, become, bishop, of, placentia, and, died, possibly, murdered, a, few, weeks, later, majorian, and, ricimer, were, now, in, control, of, italy, ricimer, was, the, son, of, a, suevic, king, and, his, mother, was, the, daughter, of, a, gothic, one, so, he, could, not, aspire, to, an, imperial, throne, after, some, months, allowing, for, negotiation, with, the, new, emperor, of, constantinople, and, the, defeat, of, 900, alamannic, invaders, of, italy, by, one, of, his, subordinates, majorian, was, acclaimed, as, augustus, majorian, is, described, by, gibbon, as, a, great, and, heroic, character, he, rebuilt, the, army, and, navy, of, italy, with, vigour, and, set, about, recovering, the, remaining, gallic, provinces, which, had, not, recognized, his, elevation, he, defeated, the, visigoths, at, the, battle, of, arelate, reducing, them, to, federate, status, and, obliging, them, to, give, up, their, claims, in, hispania, he, moved, on, to, subdue, the, burgundians, the, gallo, romans, around, lugdunum, who, were, granted, tax, concessions, and, whose, senior, officials, were,

disadvantageous, to, the, richest, aristocrats, majorian, prepared, a, fleet, at, carthago, nova, for, the, essential, reconquest, of, the, diocese, of, africa, the, fleet, was, burned, by, traitors, and, majorian, made, peace, with, the, vandals, and, returned, to, italy, here, ricimer, met, him, arrested, him, and, executed, him, five, days, later, marcellinus, in, dalmatia, and, aegidius, around, soissons, in, northern, gaul, rejected, both, ricimer, and, his, puppets, and, maintained, some, version, of, roman, rule, in, their, areas, ricimer, later, ceded, narbo, and, its, hinterland, to, the, visigoths, in, exchange, for, their, help, against, aegidius, this, made, it, impossible, for, roman, armies, to, march, from, italy, to, hispania, ricimer, was, then, the, effective, ruler, of, italy, but, little, else, for, several, years, from, 461, to, 465, the, pious, italian, aristocrat, libius, severus, reigned, there, is, no, record, of, anything, significant, that, he, even, tried, to, achieve, he, was, never, acknowledged, by, the, east, whose, help, ricimer, needed, and, he, died, conveniently, in, 465, after, two, years, without, a, western, emperor, the, eastern, court, nominated, anthemius, a, successful, general, who, had, a, strong, claim, to, the, eastern, throne, he, arrived, in, italy, with, an, army, supported, by, marcellinus, and, his, fleet,

with, the, main, force, defeated, a, vandal, fleet, near, sicily, and, landed, at, cape, bon, here, genseric, offered, to, surrender, if, he, could, have, a, five, day, truce, to, prepare, the, process, he, used, the, respite, to, prepare, a, full, scale, attack, preceded, by, fireships, which, destroyed, most, of, the, roman, fleet, and, killed, many, of, its, soldiers, the, vandals, were, confirmed, in, their, possession, of, the, diocese, of, africa, they, soon, retook, sardinia, and, sicily, marcellinus, was, murdered, possibly, on, orders, from, ricimer, the, praetorian, prefect, of, gaul, arvandus, tried, to, persuade, euric, the, new, king, of, the, visigoths, to, rebel, on, the, grounds, that, roman, power, in, gaul, was, finished, anyway, the, king, refused, anthemius, was, still, in, command, of, an, army, in, italy, additionally, in, northern, gaul, a, british, army, led, by, one, riothamus, operated, in, imperial, interests, at, the, battle, of, d, ols, anthemius, sent, his, son, anthemiolus, over, the, alps, with, an, army, to, request, the, visigoths, to, return, southern, gaul, to, roman, control, this, would, have, allowed, the, empire, land, access, to, hispania, again, the, visigoths, refused, and, defeated, the, forces, of, both, riothamus, and, anthemius, at, the, battle, of, arles, with, the, burgundians, they, took, over, almost, all, of, the, remaining, imperial, territory, in, southern, gaul, ricimer, then, quarreled, with, anthemius, and, besieged, him, in, rome, which, surrendered, in, july, 472, after, more, months, of, starvation, anthemius, was, captured, and, executed, on, ricimer, s, orders, by, the, burgundian, prince, gundobad, in, august, ricimer, died, of, a, pulmonary, haemorrhage, olybrius, his, new, emperor, named, gundobad, as, his, patrician, then, shortly, died, himself, after, the, death, of, olybrius, there, was, a, further, interregnum, until, march, 473, when, gundobad, proclaimed, glycerius, emperor, he, may, have, made, some, attempt, to, intervene, in, gaul, if, so, it, was, unsuccessful, in, 474, julius, nepos, nephew, and, successor, of, the, general, marcellinus, arrived, in, rome, with, soldiers, and, authority, from, the, eastern, emperor, leo, i, by, that, time, gundobad, had, left, to, contest, the, burgundian, throne, in, gaul, glycerius, gave, up, without, a, fight, retiring, to, become, bishop, of, salona, in, dalmatia, julius, nepos, ruled, italy, and, dalmatia, from, ravenna, and, appointed, orestes, a, former, secretary, of, attila, as, magister, militum, in, 475, orestes, promised, land, in, italy, to, various, germanic, mercenaries, heruli, scirian, and, torcilingi, in, exchange, for, their, support, he, drove, julius, nepos, out, of, ravenna, and, proclaimed, his, own, son, flavius, momyllus, romulus, augustus, romulus, augustulus, as, emperor, on, october, 31, his, surname, augustus, was, given, the, diminutive, form, augustulus, by, rivals, because, he, was, still, a, minor, romulus, was, never, recognized, outside, italy, as, a, legitimate, ruler, in, 476, orestes, refused, to, honour, his, promises, of, land, to, his, mercenaries, who, revolted, under, the, leadership, of, odoacer, orestes, fled, to, the, city, of, pavia, on, august, 23, 476, where, the, city, s, bishop, gave, him, sanctuary, orestes, was, soon, forced, to, flee, pavia, when, odoacer, s, army, broke, through, the, city, walls, and, ravaged, the, city, odoacer, s, army, chased, orestes, to, piacenza, where, they, captured, and, executed, him, on, august, 28, 476, on, september, 4, 476, odoacer, forced, romulus, augustulus, whom, his, father, orestes, had, proclaimed, to, be, rome, s, emperor, to, abdicate, the, anonymus, valesianus, wrote, that, odoacer, taking, pity, on, his, youth, he, was, then, 16, years, old, spared, romulus, life, and, granted, him, an, annual, pension, of, 6, 000, solidi, before, sending, him, to, live, with, relatives, in, campania, odoacer, installed, himself, as, ruler, over, italy, and, sent, the, imperial, insignia, to, constantinople, by, convention, the, western, roman, empire, is, deemed, to, have, ended, on, 4, september, 476, when, odoacer, deposed, romulus, augustulus, and, proclaimed, himself, ruler, of, italy, this, convention, is, subject, to, many, qualifications, in, roman, constitutional, theory, the, empire, was, still, simply, united, under, one, emperor, implying, no, abandonment, of, territorial, claims, in, areas, where, the, convulsions, of, the, dying, empire, had, made, organized, self, defence, legitimate, rump, states, continued, under, some, form, of, roman, rule, after, 476, julius, nepos, still, claimed, to, be, emperor, of, the, west, and, controlled, dalmatia, until, his, murder, in, 480, syagrius, son, of, aegidius, ruled, the, domain, of, soissons, until, his, murder, in, 486, the, indigenous, inhabitants, of, mauretania, developed, kingdoms, of, their, own, independent, of, the, vandals, and, with, strong, roman, traits, they, again, sought, imperial, recognition, with, the, reconquests, of, justinian, i, and, they, later, put, up, effective, resistance, to, the, muslim, conquest, of, the, maghreb, the, civitates, of, britannia, continued, to, look, to, their, own, defence, as, honorius, had, authorized, they, maintained, literacy, in, latin, and, other, identifiably, roman, traits, for, some, time, although, they, sank, to, a, level, of, material, development, inferior, even, to, their, pre, roman, iron, age,
