the, kingdom, of, the, franks, latin, regnum, francorum, also, known, as, the, frankish, kingdom, the, frankish, empire, latin, imperium, francorum, or, francia, was, the, largest, post, roman, barbarian, kingdom, in, western, europe, it, was, ruled, by, the, frankish, merovingian, and, carolingian, dynasties, during, the, early, middle, ages, francia, was, among, the, last, surviving, germanic, kingdoms, from, the, migration, period, era, originally, the, core, frankish, territories, inside, the, former, western, roman, empire, were, close, to, the, rhine, and, meuse, rivers, in, the, north, before, frankish, rulers, such, as, chlodio, and, childeric, i, expanded, their, rule, into, what, is, now, northern, france, clovis, i, the, son, of, childeric, unified, all, franks, after, conquering, soissons, in, 486, and, aquitaine, in, 507, he, founded, the, merovingian, dynasty, which, was, eventually, replaced, by, the, carolingian, dynasty, under, the, nearly, continuous, campaigns, of, pepin, of, herstal, charles, martel, pepin, the, short, charlemagne, and, louis, the, pious, father, son, grandson, great, grandson, and, great, great, grandson, the, greatest, expansion, of, the, frankish, empire, was, secured, by, the, early, 9th, century, and, is, by, this, point, referred, to, as, the, carolingian, empire, during, the, reign, of, the, merovingian, and, carolingian, dynasties, the, frankish, realm, was, one, large, polity, generally, subdivided, into, several, smaller, kingdoms, ruled, by, different, members, of, the, ruling, dynasties, whilst, these, kingdoms, coordinated, they, also, regularly, came, into, conflict, with, one, another, the, old, frankish, lands, for, example, were, initially, contained, within, the, kingdom, of, austrasia, centred, on, the, rhine, and, meuse, roughly, corresponding, to, later, lower, lotharingia, the, gallo, roman, territory, to, its, south, and, west, was, called, neustria, the, exact, borders, and, number, of, these, subkingdoms, varied, over, time, until, a, basic, split, between, eastern, and, western, domains, became, persistent, after, various, treaties, and, conflicts, in, the, late, 9th, and, early, 10th, centuries, west, francia, came, under, control, of, the, capetian, dynasty, becoming, the, kingdom, of, france, while, east, francia, and, lotharingia, came, under, the, control, of, the, non, frankish, ottonian, dynasty, becoming, the, kingdom, of, germany, which, would, conquer, burgundy, and, italy, to, then, form, the, medieval, holy, roman, empire, competing, french, and, german, nationalisms, in, later, centuries, would, claim, succession, from, charlemagne, and, the, original, kingdom, but, nowadays, both, have, become, seen, by, many, as, pan, european, symbols, the, term, franks, emerged, in, the, 3rd, century, ad, as, a, term, for, several, germanic, tribes, who, settled, on, the, northern, rhine, frontier, of, the, roman, empire, including, the, bructeri, ampsivarii, chamavi, chattuarii, and, salians, while, all, of, them, had, a, tradition, of, participating, in, the, roman, military, the, salians, were, allowed, to, settle, within, the, roman, empire, in, 358, having, already, been, living, in, the, civitas, of, batavia, for, some, time, emperor, julian, defeated, the, chamavi, and, salians, allowing, the, latter, to, settle, further, away, from, the, border, in, toxandria, some, of, the, early, frankish, leaders, such, as, flavius, bauto, and, arbogast, were, committed, to, the, cause, of, the, romans, but, other, frankish, rulers, such, as, mallobaudes, were, active, on, roman, soil, for, other, reasons, after, the, fall, of, arbogastes, his, son, arigius, succeeded, in, establishing, a, hereditary, countship, at, trier, and, after, the, fall, of, the, usurper, constantine, iii, some, franks, supported, the, usurper, jovinus, 411, jovinus, was, dead, by, 413, but, the, romans, found, it, increasingly, difficult, to, manage, the, franks, within, their, borders, the, frankish, king, theudemer, was, executed, by, the, sword, in, c, 422, around, 428, the, king, chlodio, whose, kingdom, may, have, been, in, the, civitas, tungrorum, with, its, capital, in, tongeren, launched, an, attack, on, roman, territory, and, extended, his, realm, as, far, as, camaracum, cambrai, and, the, somme, though, sidonius, apollinaris, relates, that, flavius, aetius, defeated, a, wedding, party, of, his, people, c, 431, this, period, marks, the, beginning, of, a, situation, that, would, endure, for, many, centuries, the, germanic, franks, ruled, over, an, increasing, number, of, gallo, roman, subjects, the, merovingians, reputed, to, be, relatives, of, chlodio, arose, from, within, the, gallo, roman, military, with, childeric, and, his, son, clovis, being, called, king, of, the, franks, in, the, gallo, roman, military, even, before, having, any, frankish, territorial, kingdom, once, clovis, defeated, his, roman, competitor, for, power, in, northern, gaul, syagrius, he, turned, to, the, kings, of, the, franks, to, the, north, and, east, as, well, as, other, post, roman, kingdoms, already, existing, in, gaul, visigoths, burgundians, and, alemanni, the, original, core, territory, of, the, frankish, kingdom, later, came, to, be, known, as, austrasia, the, eastern, lands, while, the, large, romanised, frankish, kingdom, in, northern, gaul, came, to, be, known, as, neustria, chlodio, s, successors, are, obscure, figures, but, what, can, be, certain, is, that, childeric, i, possibly, his, grandson, ruled, a, salian, kingdom, from, tournai, as, a, foederatus, of, the, romans, childeric, is, chiefly, important, to, history, for, bequeathing, the, franks, to, his, son, clovis, who, began, an, effort, to, extend, his, authority, over, the, other, frankish, tribes, and, to, expand, their, territorium, south, and, west, into, gaul, clovis, converted, to, christianity, and, put, himself, on, good, terms, with, the, powerful, church, and, with, his, gallo, roman, subjects, in, a, thirty, year, reign, 481, 511, clovis, defeated, the, roman, general, syagrius, and, conquered, the, kingdom, of, soissons, defeated, the, alemanni, battle, of, tolbiac, in, 496, and, established, frankish, hegemony, over, them, clovis, defeated, the, visigoths, battle, of, vouill, in, 507, and, conquered, all, of, their, territory, north, of, the, pyrenees, save, septimania, and, conquered, the, bretons, according, to, gregory, of, tours, and, made, them, vassals, of, the, franks, he, also, incorporated, the, various, roman, military, settlements, laeti, scattered, over, gaul, the, saxons, of, bessin, the, britons, and, the, alans, of, armorica, and, loire, valley, or, the, taifals, of, poitou, to, name, a, few, prominent, ones, by, the, end, of, his, life, clovis, ruled, all, of, gaul, save, the, gothic, province, of, septimania, and, the, burgundian, kingdom, in, the, southeast, the, exact, date, on, which, clovis, became, king, of, all, franks, is, not, known, but, it, happened, sometime, after, the, battle, of, vouill, which, is, securely, dated, to, 507, one, year, after, this, battle, clovis, made, paris, his, capital, and, in, the, christmas, day, of, the, same, year, he, converted, to, catholicism, and, some, time, later, he, orchestrated, the, murders, of, frankish, kings, sigobert, and, ragnachar, uniting, all, franks, under, his, rule, the, sole, source, for, this, early, period, is, gregory, of, tours, who, wrote, around, the, year, 590, his, chronology, for, the, reigns, of, the, early, kings, if, almost, certainly, fabricated, often, contradicting, itself, and, other, sources, clovis, baptism, traditionally, dated, to, 496, is, now, believed, to, have, taken, place, in, 508, the, merovingians, were, a, hereditary, monarchy, the, frankish, kings, adhered, to, the, practice, of, partible, inheritance, dividing, their, lands, among, their, sons, even, when, multiple, merovingian, kings, ruled, the, kingdom, not, unlike, the, late, roman, empire, was, conceived, of, as, a, single, realm, ruled, collectively, by, several, kings, and, the, turn, of, events, could, result, in, the, reunification, of, the, whole, realm, under, a, single, king, the, merovingian, kings, ruled, by, divine, right, and, their, kingship, was, symbolised, daily, by, their, long, hair, and, initially, by, their, acclamation, which, was, carried, out, by, raising, the, king, on, a, shield, in, accordance, with, the, ancient, germanic, practice, of, electing, a, war, leader, at, an, assembly, of, the, warriors, at, the, death, of, clovis, his, kingdom, was, divided, territorially, by, his, four, adult, sons, in, such, a, way, that, each, son, was, granted, a, comparable, portion, of, fiscal, land, which, was, probably, land, once, part, of, the, roman, fisc, now, seized, by, the, frankish, government, clovis, s, sons, made, their, capitals, near, the, frankish, heartland, in, northeastern, gaul, theuderic, i, made, his, capital, at, reims, chlodomer, at, orl, ans, childebert, i, at, paris, and, chlothar, i, at, soissons, during, their, reigns, the, thuringii, 532, burgundes, 534, and, saxons, and, frisians, c, 560, were, incorporated, into, the, frankish, kingdom, the, outlying, trans, rhenish, tribes, were, loosely, attached, to, frankish, sovereignty, and, though, they, could, be, forced, to, contribute, to, frankish, military, efforts, in, times, of, weak, kings, they, were, uncontrollable, and, liable, to, attempt, independence, the, romanised, burgundian, kingdom, however, was, preserved, in, its, territoriality, by, the, franks, and, converted, into, one, of, their, primary, divisions, incorporating, the, central, gallic, heartland, of, chlodomer, s, realm, with, its, capital, at, orl, ans, the, fraternal, kings, showed, only, intermittent, signs, of, friendship, and, were, often, in, rivalry, on, the, early, death, of, chlodomer, his, brother, chlothar, had, his, young, sons, murdered, in, order, to, take, a, share, of, his, kingdom, which, was, in, accordance, with, custom, divided, between, the, surviving, brothers, theuderic, died, in, 534, but, his, adult, son, theudebert, i, was, capable, of, defending, his, inheritance, which, formed, the, largest, of, the, frankish, subkingdoms, and, the, kernel, of, the, later, kingdom, of, austrasia, theudebert, was, the, first, frankish, king, to, formally, sever, his, ties, to, the, byzantine, empire, by, striking, gold, coins, with, his, own, image, on, them, and, calling, himself, magnus, rex, great, king, because, of, his, supposed, suzerainty, over, peoples, as, far, away, as, pannonia, theudebert, interfered, in, the, gothic, war, on, the, side, of, the, gepids, and, lombards, against, the, ostrogoths, receiving, the, provinces, of, raetia, noricum, and, part, of, veneto, his, son, and, successor, theudebald, was, unable, to, retain, them, and, on, his, death, all, of, his, vast, kingdom, passed, to, chlothar, under, whom, with, the, death, of, childebert, in, 558, the, entire, frankish, realm, was, reunited, under, the, rule, of, one, king, in, 561, chlothar, died, and, his, realm, was, divided, in, a, replay, of, the, events, of, fifty, years, prior, between, his, four, sons, with, the, chief, cities, remaining, the, same, the, eldest, son, charibert, i, inherited, the, kingdom, with, its, capital, at, paris, and, ruled, all, of, western, gaul, the, second, eldest, guntram, inherited, the, old, kingdom, of, the, burgundians, augmented, by, the, lands, of, central, france, around, the, old, capital, of, orl, ans, which, became, his, chief, city, and, most, of, provence, the, rest, of, provence, the, auvergne, and, eastern, aquitaine, were, assigned, to, the, third, son, sigebert, i, who, also, inherited, austrasia, with, its, chief, cities, of, reims, and, metz, the, smallest, kingdom, was, that, of, soissons, which, went, to, the, youngest, son, chilperic, i, the, kingdom, chilperic, ruled, at, his, death, 584, became, the, nucleus, of, later, neustria, this, second, fourfold, division, was, quickly, ruined, by, fratricidal, wars, waged, largely, over, the, murder, of, galswintha, the, wife, of, chilperic, allegedly, by, his, mistress, and, second, wife, fredegund, galswintha, s, sister, the, wife, of, sigebert, brunhilda, incited, her, husband, to, war, and, the, conflict, between, the, two, queens, continued, to, plague, relations, until, the, next, century, guntram, sought, to, keep, the, peace, though, he, also, attempted, twice, 585, and, 589, to, conquer, septimania, from, the, goths, but, was, defeated, both, times, all, the, surviving, brothers, benefited, at, the, death, of, charibert, but, chilperic, was, also, able, to, extend, his, authority, during, the, period, of, war, by, bringing, the, bretons, to, heel, again, after, his, death, guntram, had, to, again, force, the, bretons, to, submit, in, 587, the, treaty, of, andelot, the, text, of, which, explicitly, refers, to, the, entire, frankish, realm, as, francia, between, brunhilda, and, guntram, secured, his, protection, of, her, young, son, childebert, ii, who, had, succeeded, the, assassinated, sigebert, 575, together, the, territory, of, guntram, and, childebert, was, well, over, thrice, as, large, as, the, small, realm, of, chilperic, s, successor, chlothar, ii, during, this, period, francia, took, on, the, tripartite, character, it, was, to, have, throughout, the, rest, of, its, history, being, composed, of, neustria, austrasia, and, burgundy, when, guntram, died, in, 592, burgundy, went, to, childebert, in, its, entirety, but, he, died, in, 595, his, two, sons, divided, the, kingdom, with, the, elder, theudebert, ii, taking, austrasia, plus, childebert, s, portion, of, aquitaine, while, his, younger, brother, theuderic, ii, inherited, burgundy, and, guntram, s, aquitaine, united, the, brothers, sought, to, remove, their, father, s, cousin, chlothar, ii, from, power, and, they, did, succeed, in, conquering, most, of, his, kingdom, reducing, him, to, only, a, few, cities, but, they, failed, to, capture, him, in, 599, they, routed, his, forces, at, dormelles, and, seized, the, dentelin, but, they, then, fell, foul, of, each, other, and, the, remainder, of, their, time, on, the, thrones, was, spent, in, infighting, often, incited, by, their, grandmother, brunhilda, who, angered, over, her, expulsion, from, theudebert, s, court, convinced, theuderic, to, unseat, him, and, kill, him, in, 612, he, did, and, the, whole, realm, of, his, father, childebert, was, once, again, ruled, by, one, man, this, was, short, lived, however, as, he, died, on, the, eve, of, preparing, an, expedition, against, chlothar, in, 613, leaving, a, young, son, named, sigebert, ii, during, their, reigns, theudebert, and, theuderic, campaigned, successfully, in, gascony, where, they, had, established, the, duchy, of, gascony, and, brought, the, basques, to, submission, 602, this, original, gascon, conquest, included, lands, south, of, the, pyrenees, namely, biscay, and, gipuzkoa, but, these, were, lost, to, the, visigoths, in, 612, on, the, opposite, end, of, his, realm, the, alemanni, had, defeated, theuderic, in, a, rebellion, and, the, franks, were, losing, their, hold, on, the, trans, rhenish, tribes, in, 610, theudebert, had, extorted, the, duchy, of, alsace, from, theuderic, beginning, a, long, period, of, conflict, over, which, kingdom, was, to, have, the, region, of, alsace, burgundy, or, austrasia, which, was, only, terminated, in, the, late, seventh, century, during, the, brief, minority, of, sigebert, ii, the, office, of, the, mayor, of, the, palace, which, had, for, sometime, been, visible, in, the, kingdoms, of, the, franks, came, to, the, fore, in, its, internal, politics, with, a, faction, of, nobles, coalescing, around, the, persons, of, warnachar, ii, rado, and, pepin, of, landen, to, give, the, kingdom, over, to, chlothar, in, order, to, remove, brunhilda, the, young, king, s, regent, from, power, warnachar, was, himself, already, the, mayor, of, the, palace, of, austrasia, while, rado, and, pepin, were, to, find, themselves, rewarded, with, mayoral, offices, after, chlothar, s, coup, succeeded, and, brunhilda, and, the, ten, year, old, king, were, killed, immediately, after, his, victory, chlothar, ii, promulgated, the, edict, of, paris, 614, which, has, generally, been, viewed, as, a, concession, to, the, nobility, though, this, view, has, come, under, recent, criticism, the, edict, primarily, sought, to, guarantee, justice, and, end, corruption, in, government, but, it, also, entrenched, the, regional, differences, between, the, three, kingdoms, of, francia, and, probably, granted, the, nobles, more, control, over, judicial, appointments, by, 623, the, austrasians, had, begun, to, clamour, for, a, king, of, their, own, since, chlothar, was, so, often, absent, from, the, kingdom, and, because, of, his, upbringing, and, previous, rule, in, the, seine, basin, was, more, or, less, an, outsider, there, chlothar, thus, granted, that, his, son, dagobert, i, would, be, their, king, and, he, was, duly, acclaimed, by, the, austrasian, warriors, in, the, traditional, fashion, nonetheless, though, dagobert, exercised, true, authority, in, his, realm, chlothar, maintained, ultimate, control, over, the, whole, frankish, kingdom, during, the, joint, reign, of, chlothar, and, dagobert, who, have, been, called, the, last, ruling, merovingians, the, saxons, who, had, been, loosely, attached, to, francia, since, the, late, 550s, rebelled, under, berthoald, duke, of, saxony, and, were, defeated, and, reincorporated, into, the, kingdom, by, the, joint, action, of, father, and, son, when, chlothar, died, in, 628, dagobert, in, accordance, with, his, father, s, wishes, granted, a, subkingdom, to, his, younger, brother, charibert, ii, this, subkingdom, commonly, called, aquitaine, was, a, new, creation, dagobert, in, his, dealings, with, the, saxons, alemans, and, thuringii, as, well, as, the, slavs, beyond, the, borders, of, francia, upon, whom, he, tried, to, force, tribute, but, who, instead, defeated, him, under, their, king, samo, at, the, battle, of, wogastisburg, in, 631, made, all, the, far, eastern, peoples, subject, to, the, court, of, neustria, and, not, of, austrasia, this, first, and, foremost, incited, the, austrasians, to, request, a, king, of, their, own, from, the, royal, household, the, subkingdom, of, aquitaine, corresponded, to, the, southern, half, of, the, old, roman, province, of, aquitania, and, its, capital, was, at, toulouse, the, other, cities, of, his, kingdom, were, cahors, agen, p, rigueux, bordeaux, and, saintes, the, duchy, of, vasconia, was, also, part, of, his, allotment, charibert, campaigned, successfully, against, the, basques, but, after, his, death, they, revolted, again, 632, at, the, same, time, the, bretons, rose, up, against, frankish, suzerainty, in, 635, an, army, sent, by, dagobert, subdued, the, basques, while, threats, of, military, action, induced, the, breton, leader, judicael, to, relent, make, peace, with, the, franks, and, pay, tribute, meanwhile, dagobert, had, charibert, s, infant, successor, chilperic, assassinated, and, reunited, the, entire, frankish, realm, again, 632, though, he, was, forced, by, the, strong, austrasian, aristocracy, to, grant, his, own, son, sigebert, iii, to, them, as, a, subking, in, 633, this, act, was, precipitated, largely, by, the, austrasians, desire, to, be, self, governing, at, a, time, when, neustrians, dominated, at, the, royal, court, chlothar, had, been, the, king, at, paris, for, decades, before, becoming, the, king, at, metz, as, well, and, the, merovingian, monarchy, was, ever, after, him, to, be, a, neustrian, monarchy, first, and, foremost, indeed, it, is, in, the, 640s, that, neustria, first, appears, in, writing, its, late, appearance, relative, to, austrasia, probably, due, to, the, fact, that, neustrians, who, formed, the, bulk, of, the, authors, of, the, time, called, their, region, simply, francia, burgundia, too, defined, itself, in, opposition, to, neustria, at, about, this, time, however, it, was, the, austrasians, who, had, been, seen, as, a, distinct, people, within, the, realm, since, the, time, of, gregory, of, tours, who, were, to, make, the, most, strident, moves, for, independence, the, young, sigebert, was, dominated, during, his, minority, by, the, mayor, grimoald, the, elder, who, convinced, the, childless, king, to, adopt, his, own, merovingian, named, son, childebert, as, his, son, and, heir, after, dagobert, s, death, in, 639, the, duke, of, thuringia, radulf, rebelled, and, tried, to, make, himself, king, he, defeated, sigebert, in, what, was, a, serious, reversal, for, the, ruling, dynasty, 640, the, king, lost, the, support, of, many, magnates, while, on, campaign, and, the, weakness, of, the, monarchic, institutions, by, that, time, are, evident, in, his, inability, to, effectively, make, war, without, the, support, of, the, magnates, in, fact, he, could, not, even, provide, his, own, bodyguard, without, the, loyal, aid, of, grimoald, and, adalgisel, he, is, often, regarded, as, the, first, roi, fain, ant, do, nothing, king, not, insofar, as, he, did, nothing, but, insofar, as, he, accomplished, little, clovis, ii, dagobert, s, successor, in, neustria, and, burgundy, which, were, thereafter, attached, yet, ruled, separately, was, a, minor, for, almost, the, whole, of, his, reign, he, was, dominated, by, his, mother, nanthild, and, the, mayor, of, the, neustrian, palace, erchinoald, erchinoald, s, successor, ebroin, dominated, the, kingdom, for, the, next, fifteen, years, of, near, constant, civil, war, on, his, death, 656, sigbert, s, son, was, shipped, off, to, ireland, while, grimoald, s, son, childebert, reigned, in, austrasia, ebroin, eventually, reunited, the, entire, frankish, kingdom, for, clovis, s, successor, chlothar, iii, by, killing, grimoald, and, removing, childebert, in, 661, however, the, austrasians, demanded, a, king, of, their, own, again, and, chlothar, installed, his, younger, brother, childeric, ii, during, chlothar, s, reign, the, franks, had, made, an, attack, on, northwestern, italy, but, were, driven, off, by, grimoald, king, of, the, lombards, near, rivoli, in, 673, chlothar, iii, died, and, some, neustrian, and, burgundian, magnates, invited, childeric, to, become, king, of, the, whole, realm, but, he, soon, upset, some, neustrian, magnates, and, he, was, assassinated, 675, the, reign, of, theuderic, iii, was, to, prove, the, end, of, the, merovingian, dynasty, s, power, theuderic, iii, succeeded, his, brother, chlothar, iii, in, neustria, in, 673, but, childeric, ii, of, austrasia, displaced, him, soon, thereafter, until, he, died, in, 675, and, theuderic, iii, retook, his, throne, when, dagobert, ii, died, in, 679, theuderic, received, austrasia, as, well, and, became, king, of, the, whole, frankish, realm, thoroughly, neustrian, in, outlook, he, allied, with, his, mayor, berchar, and, made, war, on, the, austrasian, who, had, installed, dagobert, ii, sigebert, iii, s, son, in, their, kingdom, briefly, in, opposition, to, clovis, iii, in, 687, he, was, defeated, by, pepin, of, herstal, the, arnulfing, mayor, of, austrasia, and, the, real, power, in, that, kingdom, at, the, battle, of, tertry, and, was, forced, to, accept, pepin, as, sole, mayor, and, dux, et, princeps, francorum, duke, and, prince, of, the, franks, a, title, which, signifies, to, the, author, of, the, liber, historiae, francorum, the, beginning, of, pepin, s, reign, thereafter, the, merovingian, monarchs, showed, only, sporadically, in, our, surviving, records, any, activities, of, a, non, symbolic, and,

however, pepin, launched, a, campaign, of, conquest, in, western, frisia, frisia, citerior, and, defeated, the, frisian, king, radbod, near, dorestad, an, important, trading, centre, all, the, land, between, the, scheldt, and, the, vlie, was, incorporated, into, francia, then, circa, 690, pepin, attacked, central, frisia, and, took, utrecht, in, 695, pepin, could, even, sponsor, the, foundation, of, the, archdiocese, of, utrecht, and, the, beginning, of, the, conversion, of, the, frisians, under, willibrord, however, eastern, frisia, frisia, ulterior, remained, outside, of, frankish, suzerainty, having, achieved, great, successes, against, the, frisians, pepin, turned, towards, the, alemanni, in, 709, he, launched, a, war, against, willehari, duke, of, the, ortenau, probably, in, an, effort, to, force, the, succession, of, the, young, sons, of, the, deceased, gotfrid, on, the, ducal, throne, this, outside, interference, led, to, another, war, in, 712, and, the, alemanni, were, for, the, time, being, restored, to, the, frankish, fold, however, in, southern, gaul, which, was, not, under, arnulfing, influence, the, regions, were, pulling, away, from, the, royal, court, under, leaders, such, as, savaric, of, auxerre, antenor, of, provence, and, odo, of, aquitaine, the, reigns, of, clovis, iv, and, childebert, iii, from, 691, until, 711, have, all, the, hallmarks, of, those, of, rois, fain, ants, though, childebert, is, founding, making, royal, judgements, against, the, interests, of, his, supposed, masters, the, arnulfings, when, pepin, died, in, 714, however, the, frankish, realm, plunged, into, civil, war, and, the, dukes, of, the, outlying, provinces, became, de, facto, independent, pepin, s, appointed, successor, theudoald, under, his, widow, plectrude, initially, opposed, an, attempt, by, the, king, dagobert, iii, to, appoint, ragenfrid, as, mayor, of, the, palace, in, all, the, realms, but, soon, there, was, a, third, candidate, for, the, mayoralty, of, austrasia, in, pepin, s, illegitimate, adult, son, charles, martel, after, the, defeat, of, plectrude, and, theudoald, by, the, king, now, chilperic, ii, and, ragenfrid, charles, briefly, raised, a, king, of, his, own, chlothar, iv, in, opposition, to, chilperic, finally, at, a, battle, near, soisson, charles, definitively, defeated, his, rivals, and, forced, them, into, hiding, eventually, accepting, the, king, back, on, the, condition, that, he, receive, his, father, s, positions, 718, there, were, no, more, active, merovingian, kings, after, that, point, and, charles, and, his, carolingian, heirs, ruled, the, franks, after, 718, charles, martel, embarked, on, a, series, of, wars, intended, to, strengthen, the, franks, hegemony, in, western, europe, in, 718, he, defeated, the, rebellious, saxons, in, 719, he, overran, western, frisia, in, 723, he, suppressed, the, saxons, again, and, in, 724, he, defeated, ragenfrid, and, the, rebellious, neustrians, ending, the, civil, war, phase, of, his, rule, in, 720, when, chilperic, ii, died, he, had, appointed, theuderic, iv, king, but, this, last, was, a, mere, puppet, of, his, in, 724, he, forced, his, choice, of, hugbert, for, the, ducal, succession, upon, the, bavarians, and, forced, the, alemanni, to, assist, him, in, his, campaigns, in, bavaria, 725, and, 726, where, laws, were, promulgated, in, theuderic, s, name, in, 730, alemannia, had, to, be, subjugated, by, the, sword, and, its, duke, lantfrid, was, killed, in, 734, charles, fought, against, eastern, frisia, and, finally, subdued, it, in, the, 730s, the, umayyad, conquerors, of, spain, who, had, also, subjugated, septimania, began, advancing, northwards, into, central, francia, and, the, loire, valley, it, was, at, this, time, circa, 736, that, maurontus, the, dux, of, provence, called, in, the, umayyads, to, aid, him, in, resisting, the, expanding, influence, of, the, carolingians, however, charles, invaded, the, rh, ne, valley, with, his, brother, childebrand, and, a, lombard, army, and, devastated, the, region, it, was, because, of, the, alliance, against, the, arabs, that, charles, was, unable, to, support, pope, gregory, iii, against, the, lombards, in, 732, or, 737, modern, scholars, have, debated, over, the, date, charles, marched, against, an, arab, army, between, poitiers, and, tours, and, defeated, it, in, a, watershed, battle, that, turned, back, the, tide, of, the, arab, advance, north, of, the, pyrenees, but, charles, s, real, interests, lay, in, the, northeast, primarily, with, the, saxons, from, whom, he, had, to, extort, the, tribute, which, for, centuries, they, had, paid, to, the, merovingians, shortly, before, his, death, in, october, 741, charles, divided, the, realm, as, if, he, were, king, between, his, two, sons, by, his, first, wife, marginalising, his, younger, son, grifo, who, did, receive, a, small, portion, it, is, unknown, exactly, what, though, there, had, been, no, king, since, theuderic, s, death, in, 737, charles, s, sons, pepin, the, younger, and, carloman, were, still, only, mayors, of, the, palaces, the, carolingians, had, assumed, the, regal, status, and, practice, though, not, the, regal, title, of, the, merovingians, the, division, of, the, kingdom, gave, austrasia, alemannia, and, thuringia, to, carloman, and, neustria, provence, and, burgundy, to, pepin, it, is, indicative, of, the, de, facto, autonomy, of, the, duchies, of, aquitaine, under, hunoald, and, bavaria, under, odilo, that, they, were, not, included, in, the, division, of, the, regnum, after, charles, martel, was, buried, in, the, abbey, of, saint, denis, alongside, the, merovingian, kings, conflict, immediately, erupted, between, pepin, and, carloman, on, one, side, and, grifo, their, younger, brother, on, the, other, though, carloman, captured, and, imprisoned, grifo, it, may, have, been, enmity, between, the, elder, brothers, that, caused, pepin, to, release, grifo, while, carloman, was, on, a, pilgrimage, to, rome, perhaps, in, an, effort, to, neutralise, his, brother, s, ambitions, carloman, initiated, the, appointment, of, a, new, king, childeric, iii, drawn, from, a, monastery, in, 743, others, have, suggested, that, perhaps, the, position, of, the, two, brothers, was, weak, or, challenged, or, perhaps, there, carloman, was, merely, acting, for, a, loyalist, or, legitimist, party, in, the, kingdom, in, 743, pepin, campaigned, against, odilo, and, forced, him, to, submit, to, frankish, suzerainty, carloman, also, campaigned, against, the, saxons, and, the, two, together, defeated, a, rebellion, led, by, hunoald, at, the, head, of, the, basques, and, another, led, by, alemanni, in, which, liutfrid, of, alsatia, probably, died, either, fighting, for, or, against, the, brothers, in, 746, however, the, frankish, armies, were, still, as, carloman, was, preparing, to, retire, from, politics, and, enter, the, monastery, of, monte, soratte, pepin, s, position, was, further, stabilised, and, the, path, was, laid, for, his, assumption, of, the, crown, in, 751, pepin, reigned, as, an, elected, king, although, such, elections, happened, infrequently, a, general, rule, in, germanic, law, stated, that, the, king, relied, on, the, support, of, his, leading, men, these, men, reserved, the, right, to, choose, a, new, kingworthy, leader, out, of, the, ruling, clan, if, they, felt, that, the, old, one, could, not, lead, them, in, profitable, battle, while, in, later, france, the, kingdom, became, hereditary, the, kings, of, the, later, holy, roman, empire, proved, unable, to, abolish, the, elective, tradition, and, continued, as, elected, rulers, until, the, empire, s, formal, end, in, 1806, pepin, solidified, his, position, in, 754, by, entering, into, an, alliance, with, pope, stephen, ii, who, presented, the, king, of, the, franks, a, copy, of, the, forged, donation, of, constantine, at, paris, and, in, a, magnificent, ceremony, at, saint, denis, anointed, the, king, and, his, family, and, declared, him, patricius, romanorum, protector, of, the, romans, the, following, year, pepin, fulfilled, his, promise, to, the, pope, and, retrieved, the, exarchate, of, ravenna, recently, fallen, to, the, lombards, and, returned, it, to, the, papacy, pepin, donated, the, re, conquered, areas, around, rome, to, the, pope, laying, the, foundation, for, the, papal, states, in, the, donation, of, pepin, which, he, laid, on, the, tomb, of, st, peter, the, papacy, had, good, cause, to, expect, that, the, remade, frankish, monarchy, would, provide, a, deferential, power, base, potestas, in, the, creation, of, a, new, world, order, centred, on, the, pope, upon, pepin, s, death, in, 768, his, sons, charles, and, carloman, once, again, divided, the, kingdom, between, themselves, however, carloman, withdrew, to, a, monastery, and, died, shortly, thereafter, leaving, sole, rule, to, his, brother, who, would, later, become, known, as, charlemagne, or, charles, the, great, a, powerful, intelligent, and, modestly, literate, figure, who, became, a, legend, for, the, later, history, of, both, france, and, germany, charlemagne, restored, an, equal, balance, between, emperor, and, pope, from, 772, onwards, charles, conquered, and, eventually, defeated, the, saxons, to, incorporate, their, realm, into, the, frankish, kingdom, this, campaign, expanded, the, practice, of, non, roman, christian, rulers, undertaking, the, conversion, of, their, neighbours, by, armed, force, frankish, catholic, missionaries, along, with, others, from, ireland, and, anglo, saxon, england, had, entered, saxon, lands, since, the, mid, 8th, century, resulting, in, increasing, conflict, with, the, saxons, who, resisted, the, missionary, efforts, and, parallel, military, incursions, charles, s, main, saxon, opponent, widukind, accepted, baptism, in, 785, as, part, of, a, peace, agreement, but, other, saxon, leaders, continued, to, fight, upon, his, victory, in, 787, at, verden, charles, ordered, the, wholesale, killing, of, thousands, of, pagan, saxon, prisoners, after, several, more, uprisings, the, saxons, suffered, definitive, defeat, in, 804, this, expanded, the, frankish, kingdom, eastwards, as, far, as, the, elbe, river, something, the, roman, empire, had, only, attempted, once, and, at, which, it, failed, in, the, battle, of, the, teutoburg, forest, 9, ad, in, order, to, more, effectively, christianize, the, saxons, charles, founded, several, bishoprics, among, them, bremen, m, nster, paderborn, and, osnabr, ck, at, the, same, time, 773, 774, charles, conquered, the, lombards, and, thus, included, northern, italy, in, his, sphere, of, influence, he, renewed, the, vatican, donation, and, the, promise, to, the, papacy, of, continued, frankish, protection, in, 788, tassilo, dux, duke, of, bavaria, rebelled, against, charles, crushing, the, rebellion, incorporated, bavaria, into, charles, s, kingdom, this, not, only, added, to, the, royal, fisc, but, also, drastically, reduced, the, power, and, influence, of, the, agilolfings, tassilo, s, family, another, leading, family, among, the, franks, and, potential, rivals, until, 796, charles, continued, to, expand, the, kingdom, even, farther, southeast, into, today, s, austria, and, parts, of, croatia, charles, thus, created, a, realm, that, reached, from, the, pyrenees, in, the, southwest, actually, including, an, area, in, northern, spain, marca, hispanica, after, 795, over, almost, all, of, today, s, france, except, brittany, which, the, franks, never, conquered, eastwards, to, most, of, today, s, germany, including, northern, italy, and, today, s, austria, in, the, hierarchy, of, the, church, bishops, and, abbots, looked, to, the, patronage, of, the, king, s, palace, where, the, sources, of, patronage, and, security, lay, charles, had, fully, emerged, as, the, leader, of, western, christendom, and, his, patronage, of, monastic, centres, of, learning, gave, rise, to, the, carolingian, renaissance, of, literate, culture, charles, also, created, a, large, palace, at, aachen, a, series, of, roads, and, a, canal, on, christmas, day, 800, pope, leo, iii, crowned, charles, as, emperor, of, the, romans, in, rome, in, a, ceremony, presented, as, a, surprise, charlemagne, did, not, wish, to, be, indebted, to, the, bishop, of, rome, a, further, papal, move, in, the, series, of, symbolic, gestures, that, had, been, defining, the, mutual, roles, of, papal, auctoritas, and, imperial, potestas, though, charlemagne, preferred, the, title, emperor, king, of, the, franks, and, lombards, the, ceremony, formally, acknowledged, the, ruler, of, the, franks, as, the, roman, emperor, triggering, disputes, with, the, byzantine, empire, which, had, maintained, the, title, since, the, division, of, the, roman, empire, into, east, and, west, the, pope, s, right, to, proclaim, successors, was, based, on, the, donation, of, constantine, a, forged, roman, imperial, decree, after, an, initial, protest, at, the, usurpation, the, byzantine, emperor, michael, i, rhangabes, acknowledged, in, 812, charlemagne, as, co, emperor, according, to, some, according, to, others, michael, i, reopened, negotiations, with, the, franks, in, 812, and, recognized, charlemagne, as, basileus, emperor, but, not, as, emperor, of, the, romans, the, coronation, gave, permanent, legitimacy, to, carolingian, primacy, among, the, franks, the, ottonians, later, resurrected, this, connection, in, 962, upon, charlemagne, s, death, on, 28, january, 814, in, aachen, he, was, buried, in, his, own, palace, chapel, at, aachen, charlemagne, had, several, sons, but, only, one, survived, him, this, son, louis, the, pious, followed, his, father, as, the, ruler, of, a, united, empire, but, sole, inheritance, remained, a, matter, of, chance, rather, than, intent, when, louis, died, in, 840, the, carolingians, adhered, to, the, custom, of, partible, inheritance, and, after, a, brief, civil, war, between, the, three, sons, they, made, an, agreement, in, 843, the, treaty, of, verdun, which, divided, the, empire, in, three, subsequently, at, the, treaty, of, mersen, 870, the, partitions, were, recast, to, the, detriment, of, lotharingia, on, 12, december, 884, charles, the, fat, son, of, louis, the, german, reunited, most, of, the, carolingian, empire, aside, from, burgundy, in, late, 887, his, nephew, arnulf, of, carinthia, revolted, and, assumed, the, title, as, king, of, the, east, franks, charles, retired, and, soon, died, on, 13, january, 888, odo, count, of, paris, was, chosen, to, rule, in, the, west, and, was, crowned, the, next, month, at, this, point, west, francia, was, composed, of, neustria, in, the, west, and, in, the, east, by, francia, proper, the, region, between, the, meuse, and, the, seine, the, carolingians, were, restored, ten, years, later, in, west, francia, and, ruled, until, 987, when, the, last, frankish, king, louis, v, died, west, francia, was, the, land, under, the, control, of, charles, the, bald, it, is, the, precursor, of, modern, france, it, was, divided, into, the, following, great, fiefs, aquitaine, brittany, burgundy, catalonia, flanders, gascony, gothia, the, le, de, france, and, toulouse, after, 987, the, kingdom, came, to, be, known, as, france, because, the, new, ruling, dynasty, the, capetians, were, originally, dukes, of, the, le, de, france, middle, francia, was, the, territory, ruled, by, lothair, i, wedged, between, east, and, west, francia, the, kingdom, which, included, the, kingdom, of, italy, burgundy, the, provence, and, the, west, of, austrasia, was, an, unnatural, creation, of, the, treaty, of, verdun, with, no, historical, or, ethnic, identity, the, kingdom, was, split, on, the, death, of, lothair, ii, in, 869, into, those, of, lotharingia, provence, with, burgundy, divided, between, it, and, lotharingia, and, north, italy, east, francia, was, the, land, of, louis, the, german, it, was, divided, into, four, duchies, swabia, alamannia, franconia, saxony, and, bavaria, to, which, after, the, death, of, lothair, ii, were, added, the, eastern, parts, of, lotharingia, this, division, persisted, until, 1268, the, end, of, the, hohenstaufen, dynasty, otto, i, was, crowned, on, 2, february, 962, marking, the, beginning, of, the, holy, roman, empire, translatio, imperii, from, the, 10th, century, east, francia, became, also, known, as, regnum, teutonicum, teutonic, kingdom, or, kingdom, of, germany, a, term, that, became, prevalent, in, salian, times, the, title, of, holy, roman, emperor, was, used, from, that, time, beginning, with, conrad, ii, the, different, frankish, tribes, such, as, the, salii, ripuarii, and, chamavi, had, different, legal, traditions, which, were, only, later, codified, largely, under, charlemagne, the, leges, salica, ribuaria, and, chamavorum, were, carolingian, creations, their, basis, in, earlier, frankish, reality, being, difficult, for, scholars, to, discern, at, the, present, distance, under, charlemagne, codifications, were, also, made, of, the, saxon, law, and, the, frisian, law, it, was, also, under, frankish, hegemony, that, the, other, germanic, societies, east, of, the, rhine, began, to, codify, their, tribal, law, in, such, compilations, as, the, lex, alamannorum, and, lex, bajuvariorum, for, the, alemanni, and, bavarii, respectively, throughout, the, frankish, kingdoms, there, continued, to, be, gallo, romans, subject, to, roman, law, and, clergy, subject, to, canon, law, after, the, frankish, conquest, of, septimania, and, catalonia, those, regions, which, had, formerly, been, under, gothic, control, continued, to, utilise, the, visigothic, law, code, during, the, early, period, frankish, law, was, preserved, by, the, rachimburgs, officials, trained, to, remember, it, and, pass, it, on, the, merovingians, adopted, the, capitulary, as, a, tool, for, the, promulgation, and, preservation, of, royal, ordinances, its, usage, was, to, continue, under, the, carolingians, and, even, the, later, spoletan, emperors, guy, and, lambert, under, a, programme, of, renovation, regni, francorum, renewal, of, the, frankish, kingdom, the, last, merovingian, capitulary, was, one, of, the, most, significant, the, edict, of, paris, issued, by, chlothar, ii, in, 614, in, the, presence, of, his, magnates, had, been, likened, to, a, frankish, magna, carta, entrenching, the, rights, of, the, nobility, but, in, actuality, it, sought, to, remove, corruption, from, the, judiciary, and, protect, local, and, regional, interests, even, after, the, last, merovingian, capitulary, kings, of, the, dynasty, continued, to, independently, exercise, some, legal, powers, childebert, iii, even, found, cases, against, the, powerful, arnulfings, and, became, renowned, among, the, people, for, his, justness, but, law, in, francia, was, to, experience, a, renaissance, under, the, carolingians, among, the, legal, reforms, adopted, by, charlemagne, were, the, codifications, of, traditional, law, mentioned, above, he, also, sought, to, place, checks, on, the, power, of, local, and, regional, judiciaries, by, the, method, of, appointing, missi, dominici, in, pairs, to, oversee, specific, regions, for, short, periods, of, time, usually, missi, were, selected, from, outside, their, respective, regions, in, order, to, prevent, conflicts, of, interest, a, capitulary, of, 802, gives,

germanic, development, in, a, number, of, frankish, synods, throughout, the, 6th, and, 7th, centuries, and, with, the, carolingian, renaissance, the, frankish, church, became, a, substantial, influence, of, the, medieval, western, church, in, the, 7th, century, the, territory, of, the, frankish, realm, was, re, christianized, with, the, help, of, irish, and, scottish, missionaries, the, result, was, the, establishment, of, numerous, monasteries, which, would, become, the, nucleus, of, old, high, german, literacy, in, the, carolingian, empire, columbanus, was, active, in, the, frankish, empire, from, 590, establishing, monasteries, until, his, death, at, bobbio, in, 615, he, arrived, on, the, continent, with, twelve, companions, and, founded, annegray, luxeuil, and, fontaines, in, france, and, bobbio, in, italy, during, the, 7th, century, the, disciples, of, columbanus, and, other, scottish, and, irish, missionaries, founded, several, monasteries, or, schottenkl, ster, in, what, are, now, france, germany, belgium, and, switzerland, the, irish, influence, in, these, monasteries, is, reflected, in, the, adoption, of, insular, style, in, book, production, visible, in, 8th, century, works, such, as, the, gelasian, sacramentary, the, insular, influence, on, the, uncial, script, of, the, later, merovingian, period, eventually, gave, way, to, the,

of, pope, and, emperor, from, leo, iii, and, charlemagne, onwards, to, the, late, tenth, century
