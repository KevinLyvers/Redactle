kingdoms, with, a, high, king, claiming, lordship, over, most, of, the, other, kings, the, duchy, of, aquitaine, came, into, personal, union, with, the, kingdom, of, england, upon, the, accession, of, henry, ii, who, had, married, eleanor, duchess, of, aquitaine, the, kingdom, of, england, and, the, duchy, of, normandy, remained, in, personal, union, until, john, lackland, henry, ii, s, son, and, fourth, generation, descendant, of, william, i, lost, the, continental, possessions, of, the, duchy, to, philip, ii, of, france, in, 1204, and, decisively, after, the, battle, of, bouvines, in, 1214, a, few, remnants, of, normandy, including, the, channel, islands, remained, in, john, s, possession, together, with, most, of, the, duchy, of, aquitaine, up, until, the, norman, conquest, of, england, wales, had, remained, for, the, most, part, independent, of, the, anglo, saxon, kingdoms, although, some, welsh, kings, did, sometimes, acknowledge, the, bretwalda, soon, after, the, norman, conquest, of, england, however, some, norman, lords, began, to, attack, wales, they, conquered, and, ruled, parts, of, it, acknowledging, the, overlordship, of, the, norman, kings, of, england, but, with, considerable, local, independence, over, many, years, these, marcher, lords, conquered, more, and, more, of, wales, against, considerable, resistance, led, by, various, welsh, princes, who, also, often, acknowledged, the, overlordship, of, the, norman, kings, of, england, edward, i, defeated, llywelyn, ap, gruffudd, and, so, effectively, conquered, wales, in, 1282, he, created, the, title, prince, of, wales, for, his, heir, the, future, edward, ii, in, 1301, edward, i, s, conquest, was, brutal, and, the, subsequent, repression, considerable, as, the, magnificent, welsh, castles, such, as, conwy, harlech, and, caernarfon, attest, edward, iii, was, the, first, english, king, to, have, a, claim, to, the, throne, of, france, his, pursuit, of, the, claim, resulted, in, the, hundred, years, war, 1337, 1453, which, pitted, five, kings, of, england, of, the, house, of, plantagenet, against, five, kings, of, france, of, the, capetian, house, of, valois, extensive, naval, raiding, was, carried, out, by, all, sides, during, the, war, often, involving, privateers, such, as, john, hawley, of, dartmouth, or, the, castilian, pero, ni, o, though, the, english, won, numerous, victories, they, were, unable, to, overcome, the, numerical, superiority, of, the, french, and, their, strategic, use, of, gunpowder, weapons, england, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, formigny, in, 1450, and, finally, at, the, battle, of, castillon, in, 1453, retaining, only, a, single, town, in, france, calais, during, the, hundred, years, war, an, english, identity, began, to, develop, in, place, of, the, previous, division, between, the, norman, lords, and, their, anglo, saxon, subjects, this, was, a, consequence, of, sustained, hostility, to, the, increasingly, nationalist, french, whose, kings, and, other, leaders, notably, the, charismatic, joan, of, arc, used, a, developing, sense, of, french, identity, to, help, draw, people, to, their, cause, the, kingdom, had, little, time, to, recover, before, entering, the, wars, of, the, roses, 1455, 1487, a, series, of, civil, wars, over, possession, of, the, throne, between, the, house, of, lancaster, whose, heraldic, symbol, was, the, red, rose, and, the, house, of, york, whose, symbol, was, the, white, rose, each, led, by, different, branches, of, the, descendants, of, edward, iii, the, end, of, these, wars, found, the, throne, held, by, the, descendant, of, an, initially, illegitimate, member, of, the, house, of, lancaster, married, to, the, eldest, daughter, of, the, house, of, york, henry, vii, and, elizabeth, of,

overthrew, the, power, of, the, catholic, church, within, the, kingdom, replacing, the, pope, as, head, of, his, own, english, church, and, seizing, the, catholic, church, s, lands, thereby, facilitating, the, creation, of, a, variation, of, catholicism, that, became, more, protestant, over, time, this, had, the, effect, of, aligning, england, with, scotland, which, also, gradually, adopted, a, protestant, religion, whereas, the, most, important, continental, powers, france, and, spain, remained, roman, catholic, the, tudor, conquest, or, reconquest, of, ireland, took, place, under, the, tudor, dynasty, following, a, failed, rebellion, against, the, crown, by, silken, thomas, the, earl, of, kildare, in, the, 1530s, henry, viii, was, declared, king, of, ireland, in, 1542, by, statute, of, the, parliament, of, ireland, with, the, aim, of, restoring, such, central, authority, as, had, been, lost, throughout, the, country, during, the, previous, two, centuries, calais,

strong, enough, to, defeat, the, spanish, armada, which, had, sought, to, invade, england, to, halt, english, support, for, the, dutch, rebels, and, to, put, a, catholic, monarch, on, the, throne, in, her, place, the, house, of, tudor, ended, with, the, death, of, elizabeth, i, on, 24, march, 1603, james, i, ascended, the, throne, of, england, and, brought, it, into, personal, union, with, the, kingdom, of, scotland, despite, the, union, of, the, crowns, the, kingdoms, remained, separate, and, independent, states, a, state, of, affairs, which, lasted, for, more, than, a, century, the, stuart, kings, overestimated, the, power, of, the, english, monarchy, and, were, cast, down, by, parliament, in, 1645, and, 1688, in, the, first, instance, charles, i, s, introduction, of, new, forms, of, taxation, in, defiance, of, parliament, led, to, the, english, civil, war, 1641, 45, in, which, the, king, was, defeated, and, to, the, abolition, of, the, monarchy, under, oliver, cromwell, during, the, interregnum, of, 1649, 1660, after, the, trial, and, execution, of, charles, i, in, january, 1649, the, rump, parliament, passed, an, act, declaring, england, to, be, a, commonwealth, on,

there, was, a, second, period, where, the, executive, power, lay, with, the, council, of, state, but, this, restoration, of, commonwealth, rule, similar, to, that, before, the, protectorate, proved, to, be, unstable, and, the, exiled, claimant, charles, ii, was, restored, to, the, throne, in, 1660, in, 1665, the, unresolved, commercial, issues, with, the, dutch, led, to, the, second, anglo,

standing, issues, and, in, the, long, term, made, it, possible, for, the, two, countries, to, unite, against, the, expansionist, policies, pursued, by, louis, xiv, of, france, in, the, short, term, however, charles, desire, to, avenge, this, setback, led, to, the, third, anglo, dutch, war, in, 1672, despite, attaining, french, support, this, time, dutch, naval, successes, made, parliament, unwilling, to, support, charles, war, effort, any, further, and, he, was, again, forced, to, make, peace, following, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, in, 1660, an, attempt, by, james, ii, to, reintroduce, roman, catholicism, a, century, after, its, suppression, by, the, tudors, led, to, the, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, in, which, he, was, exiled, by, the, dutch, prince, william, of,
