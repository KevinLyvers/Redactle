over, austria, hungary, s, annexation, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, ending, in, serbian, acquiescence, without, compensation, in, march, 1909, and, finally, the, two, balkan, wars, of, 1912, 1913,

annexation, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, emboldened, serbian, nationalists, in, serbia, and, serbs, in, bosnia, who, chafed, under, austro, hungarian, rule, and, whose, nationalist, sentiments, were, stirred, by, serb, cultural, organizations, one, notable, example, was, a, serbian, nationalist, society, narodna, odbrana, which, was, formed, in, belgrade, on, 8, october, 1908, under, the,

attempted, to, kill, the, austrian, governor, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, general, marijan, vare, anin, eraji, was, a, 22, year, old, bosnian, serb, from, nevesinje, herzegovina, who, was, a, student, at, the, faculty, of, law, university, of, zagreb, general, vere, anin, went, on, to, crush, the, last, bosnian, peasant, uprising, in, the, second, half, of, 1910, the, five, bullets, eraji, fired, at, vare, anin, and, the, fatal, bullet, he, put, in, his, own, brain, made, eraji, an, inspiration, to, future, assassins, including, princip, and, princip, s, accomplice, abrinovi, princip, said, that, eraji, was, my, first, model, when, i, was, seventeen, i, passed, whole, nights, at, his, grave, reflecting, on, our, wretched, condition, and, thinking, of, him, it, is, there, that, i, made, up, my, mind, sooner, or, later, to, perpetrate, an, outrage, in, may, 1911, the, black, hand, a, secret, society, dedicated, to, creating, a, greater, serbia, through, terrorist, action, was, established, by, key, members, of, the, narodna, odbrana, including, dimitrijevi, and, tankosi, within, bosnia, and, herzegovina, the, networks, of, both, the, black, hand, and, narodna, odbrana, penetrated, to, some, extent, local, revolutionary, movements, such, as, young, bosnia, the, fundamental, difference, between, those, movements, was, that, the, young, bosnians, regarded, social, revolution, as, a, necessary, corollary, of, national, liberation, and, that, even, though, its, membership, was, predominantly, serb, young, bosnia, also, attracted, an, important, minority, of, croats, and, some, muslims, in, the, spring, of, 1912, in, a, plot, involving, young, bosnians, luka, juki, a, bosnian, croat, student, tried, to, assassinate, the, governor, of, croatia, count,

her, husband, out, of, fear, for, his, safety, as, sophie, although, of, high, aristocratic, birth, was, not, from, a, dynastic, family, her, union, with, the, habsburg, heir, presumptive, could, only, be, a, morganatic, marriage, emperor, franz, joseph, had, only, consented, to, their, marriage, on, the, condition, that, their, descendants, would, never, ascend, the, throne, the, 14th, anniversary, of, their, marriage, fell, on, 28, june, as, historian, a, j, p, taylor, observes, could, never, share, rank, could, never, share, his, splendours, could, never, even, sit, by, his, side, on, any, public, occasion, there, was, one, loophole, his, wife, could, enjoy, the, recognition, of, his, rank, when, he, was, acting, in, a, military, capacity, hence, he, decided, in, 1914, to, inspect, the, army, in, bosnia, there, at, its, capital, sarajevo, the, archduke, and, his, wife, could, ride, in, an, open, carriage, side, by, side, thus, for, love, did, the, archduke, go, to, his, death, franz, ferdinand, was, an, advocate, of, increased, federalism, and, widely, believed, to, favor, trialism, under, which, austria, hungary, would, be, reorganized, by, combining, the, slavic, lands, within, the, austro, hungarian, empire, into, a, third, crown, a, slavic, kingdom, could, have, been, a, bulwark, against, serb, irredentism, and, franz, ferdinand, was, therefore, perceived, as, a, threat, by, those, same, irredentists, princip, later, stated, to, the, court, that, preventing, franz, ferdinand, s, planned, reforms, was, one, of, his, motivations, the, day, of, the,

informed, mehmedba, i, that, belgrade, meaning, the, black, hand, thought, that, an, attack, of, franz, ferdinand, instead, of, the, potiorek, would, be, far, more, important, and, that, they, would, support, it, apis, later, boasted, to, the, serbian, court, that, he, ordered, the, assassination, of, franz, ferdinand, in, his, position, as, head, of, the, intelligence, department, however, apis,

communicate, his, decision, to, the, drivers, as, a, result, the, archduke, s, driver, leopold, lojka, took, a, right, turn, at, the, latin, bridge, just, as, the, two, drivers, ahead, of, him, had, done, according, to, the, historian, joachim, remak, the, reason, for, this, is, that, potiorek, s, aide, erik, von, merizzi, was, in, the, hospital, and, was, therefore, unable, to, give, lojka, the, information, about, the, change, in, plans, and, the, driving, route, the, sarajevo, chief, of, police, edmund, gerde, who, had, earlier, repeatedly, warned, potiorek, of, insufficient, security, precautions, for, the, imperial, visit, was, asked, by, one, of, the, archduke, s, aides, to, tell, the, drivers, of, the, new, route, but, in, the, confusion, and, tensions, of, the, moment, he, neglected, to, do, so, after, learning, that, the, first, assassination, attempt, had, been, unsuccessful, princip, thought, about, a, position, to, assassinate, the, archduke, on, his, return, journey, and, decided, to, move, to, a, position, in, front, of, a, nearby, food, shop, schiller, s, delicatessen, near, the, latin, bridge, at, this, point, the, first, and, second, cars, of, the, archduke, s, motorcade, suddenly, turned, right, into, a, side, street, leaving, the, appel, quay, when, the, archduke, s, driver, followed, their, route, governor, potiorek, who, was, sharing, the, third, vehicle, with, the, imperial, couple, called, out, to, the, driver, to, stop, as, he, was, going, the, wrong, way, the, driver, applied, the, brakes, and, when, he, attempted, to, put, the, car, into, reverse, gear, he, accidentally, stalled, the, engine, close, to, where, princip, was, standing, the, assassin, stepped, up, to, the, footboard, of, the, car, and, shot, franz, ferdinand, and, sophie, at, point, blank, range, using, a, belgian, made, fabrique, nationale, model, 1910, 380, caliber, pistol, pistol, serial, numbers, 19074, 19075, 19120, and, 19126, were, supplied, to,

s, residence, for, medical, treatment, as, reported, by, count, harrach, franz, ferdinand, s, last, words, were, sophie, sophie, don, t, die, live, for, our, children, followed, by, six, or, seven, utterances, of, it, is, nothing, in, response, to, harrach, s, inquiry, as, to, franz, ferdinand, s, injury, these, utterances, were, followed, by, a, violent, choking, sound, caused, by, hemorrhage, the, imperial, couple, were, dead, by, 11, 30, a, m, on, 28, june, 1914, sophie, was, dead, on, arrival, at, the, governor, s, residence, and, franz, ferdinand, died, 10, minutes, later, there, is, a, myth, which, states, that, princip, had, eaten, a, sandwich, at, schiller, s, delicatessen, just, prior, to, the, shooting, but, there, are, no, primary, sources, from, the, time, which, mention, this, this, myth, likely, originated, from, the, 2001, novel, twelve, fingers, which, presents, a, fictionalized, version, of, the, events, of, the, assassination, that, includes, the, sandwich, the,

a, massive, and, vicious, snub, of, the, assassinated, couple, even, though, most, foreign, royalty, had, planned, to, attend, they, were, pointedly, disinvited, and, the, funeral, was, attended, by, just, the, immediate, imperial, family, with, the, dead, couple, s, three, children, excluded, from, the, few, public, ceremonies, the, archduke, s, friend, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, was, invited, so, that, the, imperial, cabinet, could, consult, him, on, foreign, policy, but, he, declined, to, attend, although, he, publicly, claimed, it, was, due, to, a, case, of, lumbago, imperial, chancellor, theobald, von, bethmann, hollweg, revealed, that, the, real, reason, was, security, concerns, the, officer, corps, was, forbidden, to, salute, the, funeral, train, and, this, led, to, a, minor,

responsibility, for, the, crime, on, himself, and, stated, our, enterprise, was, purely, private, and, in, no, way, official, as, the, prosecution, asserts, serbia, has, no, hand, in, it, and, cannot, be, held, responsible, for, our, deed, he, then, asked, no, one, else, knew, of, it, beyond, ciganovi, and, ourselves, how, could, serbia, be, brought, into, the, affair, princip, deposed, under,

some, doubt, as, to, his, true, date, of, birth, but, concluded, that, princip, was, under, 20, at, the, time, of, the, assassination, because, bosnia, and, herzegovina, had, not, been, assigned, to,

from, the, meeting, with, bili, ski, and, told, le, janin, that, bili, ski, showed, no, sign, of, attaching, great, importance, to, the, total, message, and, dismissed, it, limiting, himself, to, remarking, when, saying, goodbye, and, thanking, him, let, us, hope, nothing, does, happen, the, austro, hungarian, finance, minister, took, no, action, based, on, jovanovi, s, remarks, in, 1924, j,

put, a, ball, cartridge, in, his, rifle, or, revolver, in, place, of, a, blank, cartridge, and, he, may, fire, it, the, bullet, might, strike, the, man, giving, provocation, franz, ferdinand, j, jovanovi, s, account, changed, back, and, forth, over, the, years, and, never, adequately, addressed, colonel, le, janin, s, statement, bili, ski, did, not, speak, openly, on, the, subject, but, his, press, department, chief, confirmed, that, a, meeting, had, taken, place, including, a, vague, warning, but, there, was, no, mention, of, an, ethnic, serb, austro, hungarian, soldier, shooting, franz, ferdinand, in, the, days, leading, up, to, the, assassination, pa, i, was, the, caretaker, prime, minister, because, during, this, period, the, serbian, government, briefly, fell, to, a, political, alliance, led, by, the, serbian, military, the, military, favored, promoting, jovan, jovanovi, to, foreign, minister, and, jovanovi, s, loyalties, one, might, expect, to, have, been, divided, and, his, orders, therefore, carried, out, poorly, by, choosing, a, military, loyalist, to, convey, the, message, and, by, not, including, any, of, the, specifics, such, as, the, conspirators, names, and,

for, ciganovi, after, it, in, 1917, all, of, the, sarajevo, conspirators, within, serbia, s, control, were, tried, at, salonika, on, false, charges, except, ciganovi, who, even, gave, evidence, against, his, comrades, at, the, trial, apis, s, confession, to, ordering, the, assassination, of, franz, ferdinand, states, that, russian, military, attach, viktor, artamonov, promised, russia, s, protection, from, austria, hungary, if, serbia, would, ever, come, under, attack, while, admitting, funding, of, the, intelligence, network, in, austro, hungary, artamonov, denied, the, involvement, of, his, office, in, the, assassination, in, an, interview, with, albertini, artamonov, stated, that, he, went, on, vacation, to, italy, leaving, assistant, military, attach, alexander, werchovsky, in, charge, and, though, he, was, in, daily, contact, with, apis, he, did, not, learn, of, apis, s, role, until, after, the, war, had, ended, albertini, writes, that, he, remained, unconvinced, by, the, behavior, of, this, officer, werchovsky, admitted, the, involvement, of, his, office, and, then, fell, silent, on, the, subject, there, is, evidence, that, russia, was, at, least, aware, of, the, plot, before, 14, june, de, schelking, writes, on, 1, june, 1914, 14, june, new, calendar, emperor, nicholas, had, an, interview, with, king, charles, i, of, roumania, at, constanza, i, was, there, at, the, time, yet, as, far, as, i, could, judge, from, my, conversation, with, members, of, his, russian, foreign, minister, sergey, sazonov, s, entourage, he, sazonov, was, convinced, that, if, the, archduke, franz, ferdinand, were, out, of, the, way, the, peace, of, europe, would, not, be, endangered, in, august, 1914, the, independent, described, the, assassination, as, a, deplorable, but, relatively, insignificant, reason, for, which, the, financial, system, of, the, world, is, in, chaos, that, international, commerce, is, suspended, that, industries, are, everywhere, demoralized, and, families, ruined, and, that, millions, of, men, in, europe, have, taken, up, arms, with, the, intent, to, slaughter, each, other, it, may, be, doubted, whether, the, archduke, worth, all, this, carnage, the, magazine, wrote, the, murder, produced, widespread, shock, across, european, royal, houses, and, there, was, initially, much, sympathy, for, the, austrian, position, ordinary, people, did, not, really, care, about, what, happened, and, on, the, evening, of, the, assassination, the, crowds, in, vienna, listened, to, music, and, drank, wine, as, if, nothing, had, happened, within, two, days, of, the, assassination, austria, hungary, and, germany, advised, serbia, that, it, should, open, an, investigation, but, secretary, general, to, the, serbian, ministry, of, foreign, affairs, slavko, gruji, replied, nothing, had, been, done, so, far, and, the, matter, did, not, concern, the, serbian, government, an, angry, exchange, followed, between, the, austrian, charg, d, affaires, at, belgrade, and, gruji, after, conducting, a, criminal, investigation, verifying, that, germany, would, honor, its, military, alliance, and, persuading, the, sceptical, hungarian, prime,

great, powers, decision, regarding, bosnia, and, herzegovina, and, to, maintain, good, neighborly, relations, with, austria, hungary, the, letter, contained, specific, demands, that, serbia, should, accept, including, the, suppression, of, the, publication, of, propaganda, advocating, the, violent, destruction, of, austria, hungary, the, removal, of, the, people, behind, this, propaganda, from, the, serbian, military, the, dissolution, of, the, serbian, nationalist, organization, narodna, odbrana, the, arrest, of, the, people, on, serbian, soil, who, were, involved, in, the, assassination, plot, and, the, prevention, of, the, clandestine, shipment, of, arms, and, explosives, from, serbia, to, austria, hungary, it, also, demanded, that, austro, hungarian, officials, should, take, part, in, the, serbian, inquiry, into, the, assassination, plot, this, letter, became, known, as, the, july, ultimatum, and, austria, hungary, stated, that, if, serbia, did, not, accept, all, of, the, demands, in, total, within, 48, hours, it, would, recall, its, ambassador, from, serbia, after, receiving, a, telegram, of, support, from, russia, serbia, mobilized, its, army, and, responded, to, the, letter, by, completely, accepting, point, 8, demanding, an, end, to, the, smuggling, of, weapons, and, punishment, of, the, frontier, officers, who, had, assisted, the, assassins, and, completely, accepting, point, 10, which, demanded, serbia, report, the, execution, of, the, required, measures, as, they, were, completed, serbia, partially, accepted, finessed, disingenuously, answered, or, politely, rejected, elements, of, the, preamble, and, enumerated, demands, 1, 7, and, 9, the, shortcomings, of, serbia, s, response, were, published, by, austria, hungary, austria, hungary, responded, by, breaking, diplomatic, relations, according, to, a, 2021, study, franz, ferdinand, s, absence, was, key, to, the, breakdown, of, diplomacy, and, escalation, into, war, as, ferdinand, had, been, the, most, powerful, and, effective, proponent, for, peace, in, vienna, the, next, day, serbian, reservists, being, transported, on, tramp, steamers, on, the, danube, crossed, onto, the, austro, hungarian, side, of, the, river, at, temes, kubin, and, austro, hungarian, soldiers, fired, into, the, air, to, warn, them, off, the, report, of, this, incident, was, initially, sketchy, and, reported, to, emperor, franz, joseph, erroneously, as, a, considerable, skirmish, austria, hungary, then, declared, war, and, mobilized, the, portion, of, its, army, that, would, face, the, already, mobilized, serbian, army, on, 28, july, 1914, under, the, secret, treaty, of, 1892, russia, and, france, were, obliged, to, mobilize, their, armies, if, any, of, the, triple, alliance, mobilized, russia, partially, mobilized, along, its, austrian, border, on, 29, july, and, on, 30, july, russia, ordered, general, mobilization, russia, s, general, mobilization, set, off, full, austro, hungarian, and, german, mobilizations, soon, all, the, great, powers, except, italy, had, chosen, sides, and, gone, to, war, the, consequences, of, his, action, were, very, bad, for, bosnia, bosnia, ceased, to, exist, in, yugoslavia, and, bosnian, muslims, were, not, recognised, until, 1968, they, were, still, much, better, rulers, than, the, kingdom, of, yugoslavia, or, communist, yugoslavia, you, can, look, at, the, historical, records, and, see, how, austria, hungary, cared, about, issues, like, the, rule, of, law, we, lost, so, much, in, 1918, the, shots, fired, 100, years, ago, by, gavrilo, princip, were, not, fired, at, europe, they, were, shots, for, freedom, marking, the, start, of, the, serbs, fight, for, liberation, from, foreign, occupiers, later, referring, to,
