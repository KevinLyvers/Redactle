the, gupta, empire, was, an, ancient, indian, empire, on, the, indian, subcontinent, which, existed, from, the, mid, 3rd, century, ce, to, mid, 6th, century, ce, it, was, the, seventh, ruling, dynasty, of, magadha, at, its, zenith, from, approximately, 319, to, 467, ce, it, covered, much, of, the, indian, subcontinent, this, period, has, been, considered, as, the, golden, age, of, india, by, historians, although, this, characterisation, has, been, disputed, by, some, other, historians, the, ruling, dynasty, of, the, empire, was, founded, by, gupta, and, the, most, notable, rulers, of, the, dynasty, were, chandragupta, i, samudragupta, chandragupta, ii, kumaragupta, i, and, skandagupta, the, high, points, of, this, period, are, the, great, cultural, developments, which, took, place, primarily, during, the, reigns, of, samudragupta, chandragupta, ii, and, kumaragupta, i, many, hindu, epics, and, literary, sources, such, as, mahabharata, and, ramayana, were, canonised, during, this, period, the, gupta, period, produced, scholars, such, as, kalidasa, aryabhata, varahamihira, and, vatsyayana, who, made, great, advancements, in, many, academic, fields, science, and, political, administration, reached, new, heights, during, the, gupta, era, the, period, sometimes, described, as, pax, gupta, gave, rise, to, achievements, in, architecture, sculpture, and, painting, that, set, standards, of, form, and, taste, determined, the, whole, subsequent, course, of, art, not, only, in, india, but, far, beyond, her, borders, strong, trade, ties, also, made, the, region, an, important, cultural, centre, and, established, the, region, as, a, base, that, would, influence, nearby, kingdoms, and, regions, in, india, and, southeast, asia, the, puranas, earlier, long, poems, on, a, variety, of, subjects, are, also, thought, to, have, been, committed, to, written, texts, around, this, period, hinduism, was, followed, by, the, rulers, and, the, brahmins, flourished, in, the, gupta, empire, but, the, guptas, were, tolerant, towards, people, of, other, faiths, as, well, the, empire, eventually, died, out, because, of, factors, such, as, substantial, loss, of, territory, and, imperial, authority, caused, by, their, own, erstwhile, feudatories, as, well, as, the, invasion, by, the, huna, peoples, kidarites, and, alchon, huns, from, central, asia, after, the, collapse, of, the, gupta, empire, in, the, 6th, century, india, was, again, ruled, by, numerous, regional, kingdoms, the, homeland, of, the, guptas, is, uncertain, according, to, one, theory, they, originated, in, the, present, day, lower, doab, region, of, bihar, and, uttar, pradesh, where, most, of, the, inscriptions, and, coin, hoards, of, the, early, gupta, emperors, have, been, discovered, this, theory, is, also, supported, by, the, purana, as, argued, by, the, proponents, that, mention, the, territory, of, the, early, gupta, emperors, as, prayaga, saketa, and, magadha, areas, in, the, ganges, basin, another, prominent, theory, locates, the, gupta, homeland, in, the, present, day, bengal, region, in, ganges, basin, based, on, the, account, of, the, 7th, century, chinese, buddhist, monk, yijing, according, to, yijing, king, che, li, ki, to, identified, with, the, dynasty, s, founder, shri, gupta, built, a, temple, for, chinese, pilgrims, near, mi, li, kia, si, kia, po, no, apparently, a, transcription, of, mriga, shikha, vana, yijing, states, that, this, temple, was, located, more, than, 40, yojanas, east, of, nalanda, which, would, mean, it, was, situated, somewhere, in, the, modern, bengal, region, another, proposal, is, that, the, early, gupta, kingdom, extended, from, prayaga, in, the, west, to, northern, bengal, in, the, east, the, gupta, records, do, not, mention, the, dynasty, s, varna, social, class, some, historians, such, as, a, s, altekar, have, theorised, that, they, were, of, vaishya, origin, as, certain, ancient, indian, texts, prescribe, the, name, gupta, for, the, members, of, the, vaishya, varna, according, to, historian, r, s, sharma, the, vaishyas, who, were, traditionally, associated, with, trade, may, have, become, rulers, after, resisting, oppressive, taxation, by, the, previous, rulers, critics, of, the, vaishya, origin, theory, point, out, that, the, suffix, gupta, features, in, the, names, of, several, non, vaishyas, before, as, well, as, during, the, gupta, period, and, the, dynastic, name, gupta, may, have, simply, derived, from, the, name, of, the, dynasty, s, first, king, gupta, some, scholars, such, as, s, r, goyal, theorise, that, the, guptas, were, brahmins, because, they, had, matrimonial, relations, with, brahmins, but, others, reject, this, evidence, as, inconclusive, based, on, the, pune, and, riddhapur, inscriptions, of, the, gupta, princess, prabhavatigupta, some, scholars, believe, that, the, name, of, her, paternal, gotra, clan, was, dharana, but, an, alternative, reading, of, these, inscriptions, suggests, that, dharana, was, the, gotra, of, her, mother, kuberanaga, gupta, gupta, script, gu, pta, fl, late, 3rd, century, ce, is, the, earliest, known, king, of, the, dynasty, different, historians, variously, date, the, beginning, of, his, reign, from, mid, to, late, 3rd, century, ce, gupta, founded, the, gupta, empire, c, 240, 280, ce, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, ghatotkacha, c, 280, 319, ce, followed, by, ghatotkacha, s, son, chandragupta, i, c, 319, 335, ce, che, li, ki, to, the, name, of, a, king, mentioned, by, the, 7th, century, chinese, buddhist, monk, yijing, is, believed, to, be, a, transcription, of, shri, gupta, iast, rigupta, shri, being, an, honorific, prefix, according, to, yijing, this, king, built, a, temple, for, chinese, buddhist, pilgrims, near, mi, li, kia, si, kia, po, no, believed, to, be, a, transcription, of, m, ga, ikh, vana, in, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, gupta, and, his, successor, ghatotkacha, are, described, as, maharaja, great, king, while, the, next, king, chandragupta, i, is, called, a, maharajadhiraja, king, of, great, kings, in, the, later, period, the, title, maharaja, was, used, by, feudatory, rulers, which, has, led, to, suggestions, that, gupta, and, ghatotkacha, were, vassals, possibly, of, kushan, empire, however, there, are, several, instances, of, paramount, sovereigns, using, the, title, maharaja, in, both, pre, gupta, and, post, gupta, periods, so, this, cannot, be, said, with, certainty, that, said, there, is, no, doubt, that, gupta, and, ghatotkacha, held, a, lower, status, and, were, less, powerful, than, chandragupta, i, chandragupta, i, married, the, licchavi, princess, kumaradevi, which, may, have, helped, him, extend, his, political, power, and, dominions, enabling, him, to, adopt, the, prestigious, title, maharajadhiraja, according, to, the, dynasty, s, official, records, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, samudragupta, however, the, discovery, of, the, coins, issued, by, a, gupta, emperor, named, kacha, have, led, to, some, debate, on, this, topic, according, to, one, theory, kacha, was, another, name, for, samudragupta, another, possibility, is, that, kacha, was, a, rival, claimant, to, the, throne, samudragupta, succeeded, his, father, around, 335, or, 350, ce, and, ruled, until, c, 375, ce, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, composed, by, his, courtier, harisena, credits, him, with, extensive, conquests, the, inscription, asserts, that, samudragupta, uprooted, 8, kings, of, ry, varta, the, northern, region, including, the, nagas, it, further, claims, that, he, subjugated, all, the, kings, of, the, forest, region, which, was, most, probably, located, in, central, india, it, also, credits, him, with, defeating, 12, rulers, of, dakshinapatha, the, southern, region, the, exact, identification, of, several, of, these, kings, is, debated, among, modern, scholars, but, it, is, clear, that, these, kings, ruled, areas, located, on, the, eastern, coast, of, india, the, inscription, suggests, that, samudragupta, advanced, as, far, as, the, pallava, kingdom, in, the, south, and, defeated, vishnugopa, the, pallava, regent, of, kanchi, during, this, southern, campaign, samudragupta, most, probably, passed, through, the, forest, tract, of, central, india, reached, the, eastern, coast, in, present, day, odisha, and, then, marched, south, along, the, coast, of, the, bay, of, bengal, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, mentions, that, rulers, of, several, frontier, kingdoms, and, tribal, aristocracies, paid, samudragupta, tributes, obeyed, his, orders, and, performed, obeisance, before, him, the, frontier, kingdoms, included, samatata, davaka, kamarupa, nepal, and, karttripura, the, tribal, aristocracies, and, kingdoms, included, malavas, arjunayanas, yaudheyas, madrakas, and, abhiras, among, others, finally, the, inscription, mentions, that, several, foreign, kings, tried, to, please, samudragupta, by, personal, attendance, offered, him, their, daughters, in, marriage, or, according, to, another, interpretation, gifted, him, maidens, and, sought, the, use, of, the, garuda, depicting, gupta, seal, for, administering, their, own, territories, this, is, an, exaggeration, for, example, the, inscription, lists, the, king, of, simhala, among, these, kings, it, is, known, that, from, chinese, sources, that, the, simhala, king, meghavarna, sent, rich, presents, to, the, gupta, emperor, requesting, his, permission, to, build, a, buddhist, monastery, at, bodh, gaya, samudragupta, s, panegyrist, appears, to, have, described, this, act, of, diplomacy, as, an, act, of, subservience, samudragupta, appears, to, have, been, vaishnavite, as, attested, by, his, eran, inscription, and, performed, several, brahmanical, ceremonies, the, gupta, records, credit, him, with, making, generous, donations, of, cows, and, gold, he, performed, the, ashvamedha, ritual, horse, sacrifice, which, was, used, by, the, ancient, indian, kings, and, emperors, to, prove, their, imperial, sovereignty, and, issued, gold, coins, see, coinage, below, to, mark, this, performance, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, presents, samudragupta, as, a, wise, king, and, strict, administrator, who, was, also, compassionate, enough, to, help, the, poor, and, the, helpless, it, also, alludes, to, the, king, s, talents, as, a, musician, and, a, poet, and, calls, him, the, king, of, poets, such, claims, are, corroborated, by, samudragupta, s, gold, coins, which, depict, him, playing, a, veena, samudragupta, appears, to, have, directly, controlled, a, large, part, of, the, indo, gangetic, plain, in, present, day, india, as, well, as, a, substantial, part, of, central, india, besides, his, empire, comprised, a, number, of, monarchical, and, tribal, tributary, states, of, northern, india, and, of, the, south, eastern, coastal, region, of, india, ramagupta, is, known, from, a, sixth, century, play, the, devichandragupta, in, which, he, surrenders, his, queen, to, the, enemy, sakas, and, his, brother, chandragupta, has, to, sneak, into, the, enemy, camp, to, rescue, her, and, kill, the, saka, king, the, historicity, of, these, events, is, unclear, but, ramagupta, s, existence, is, confirmed, by, three, jain, statues, found, at, durjanpur, with, inscriptions, referring, to, him, as, the, maharajadhiraja, a, large, number, of, his, copper, coins, also, have, been, found, from, the, eran, vidisha, region, and, classified, in, five, distinct, types, which, include, the, garuda, garudadhvaja, lion, and, border, legend, types, the, brahmi, legends, on, these, coins, are, written, in, the, early, gupta, style, according, to, the, gupta, records, among, his, sons, samudragupta, nominated, prince, chandragupta, ii, born, of, queen, dattadevi, as, his, successor, chandragupta, ii, vikramaditya, brave, as, the, sun, ruled, from, 375, until, 415, he, married, a, kadamba, princess, of, kuntala, and, of, naga, lineage, n, gakulotpannn, kuberanaga, his, daughter, prabhavatigupta, from, this, naga, queen, was, married, to, rudrasena, ii, the, vakataka, king, of, deccan, his, son, kumaragupta, i, was, married, to, a, kadamba, princess, of, the, karnataka, region, chandragupta, ii, expanded, his, realm, westwards, defeating, the, saka, western, kshatrapas, of, malwa, gujarat, and, saurashtra, in, a, campaign, lasting, until, 409, his, main, opponent, rudrasimha, iii, was, defeated, by, 395, and, he, crushed, the, bengal, chiefdoms, this, extended, his, control, from, coast, to, coast, established, a, second, capital, at, ujjain, and, was, the, high, point, of, the, empire, kuntala, inscriptions, indicate, rule, of, chandragupta, ii, in, kuntala, country, of, karnataka, hunza, inscription, also, indicate, that, chandragupta, was, able, to, rule, north, western, indian, subcontinent, and, proceeded, to, conquer, balkh, although, some, scholars, have, also, disputed, the, identity, of, the, gupta, emperor, chalukya, king, vikramaditya, vi, r, 1076, 1126, ce, mentions, chandragupta, with, his, title, and, states, why, should, the, glory, of, the, kings, vikramaditya, and, nanda, be, a, hindrance, any, longer, he, with, a, loud, command, abolished, that, era, which, has, the, name, of, saka, and, made, that, era, which, has, the, chalukya, counting, despite, the, creation, of, the, empire, through, war, the, reign, is, remembered, for, its, very, influential, style, of, hindu, art, literature, culture, and, science, especially, during, the, reign, of, chandragupta, ii, some, excellent, works, of, hindu, art, such, as, the, panels, at, the, dashavatara, temple, in, deogarh, serve, to, illustrate, the, magnificence, of, gupta, art, above, all, it, was, the, synthesis, of, elements, that, gave, gupta, art, its, distinctive, flavour, during, this, period, the, guptas, were, supportive, of, thriving, buddhist, and, jain, cultures, as, well, and, for, this, reason, there, is, also, a, long, history, of, non, hindu, gupta, period, art, in, particular, gupta, period, buddhist, art, was, to, be, influential, in, most, of, east, and, southeast, asia, many, advances, were, recorded, by, the, chinese, scholar, and, traveller, faxian, in, his, diary, and, published, afterwards, the, court, of,

probably, confronted, the, gupta, empire, towards, the, end, of, the, rule, of, kumaragupta, i, as, his, son, skandagupta, mentions, in, the, bhitari, pillar, inscription, his, efforts, at, reshaping, a, country, in, disarray, through, reorganisation, and, military, victories, over, the, pushyamitras, and, the, hunas, he, was, the, founder, of, nalanda, university, which, on, 15, july, 2016, was, declared, as, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, kumaragupta, i, was, also, a, worshipper, of, kartikeya, skandagupta, son, and, successor, of, kumaragupta, i, is, generally, considered, to, be, the, last, of, the, great, gupta, emperors, he, assumed, the, titles, of, vikramaditya, and, kramaditya, he, defeated, the, pushyamitra, threat, but, then, was, faced, with, invading, kidarites, sometimes, described, as, the, hephthalites, or, white, huns, known, in, india, as, the, sweta, huna, from, the, northwest, he, repelled, a, huna, attack, around, 455, ce, but, the, expense, of, the, wars, drained, the, empire, s, resources, and, contributed, to, its, decline, the, bhitari, pillar, inscription, of, skandagupta, the, successor, of, chandragupta, recalls, the, near, annihilation, of, the, gupta, empire, following, the, attacks, of, the, kidarites, the, kidarites, seem, to, have, retained, the, western, part, of, the, gupta, empire, skandagupta, died, in, 467, and, was, succeeded, by, his, agnate, brother, purugupta, following, skandagupta, s, death, the, empire, was, clearly, in, decline, and, the, later, gupta, coinage, indicates, their, loss, of, control, over, much, of, western, india, after, 467, 469, skandagupta, was, followed, by, purugupta, 467, 473, kumaragupta, ii, 473, 476, budhagupta, 476, 495, narasimhagupta, 495, 530, kumaragupta, iii, 530, 540, vishnugupta, 540, 550, two, lesser, known, kings, namely, vainyagupta, and, bhanugupta, in, the, late, 490, s, the, alchon, huns, under, toramana, and, mihirakula, broke, through, the, gupta, defences, in, the, northwest, and, much, of, the, empire, in, the, northwest, was, overrun, by, the, huns, by, 500, according, to, some, scholars, the, empire, disintegrated, under, the, attacks, of, toramana, and, his, successor, mihirakula, it, appears, from, inscriptions, that, the, guptas, although, their, power, was, much, diminished, continued, to, resist, the, huns, the, hun, invader, toramana, was, defeated, by, bhanugupta, in, 510, the, huns, were, defeated, and, driven, out, of, india, in, 528, by, king, yashodharman, from, malwa, and, possibly, gupta, emperor, narasimhagupta, these, invasions, although, only, spanning, a, few, decades, had, long, term, effects, on, india, and, in, a, sense, brought, an, end, to, classical, indian, civilisation, soon, after, the, invasions, the, gupta, empire, already, weakened, by, these, invasions, and, the, rise, of, local, rulers, such, as, yashodharman, ended, as, well, following, the, invasions, northern, india, was, left, in, disarray, with, numerous, smaller, indian, powers, emerging, after, the, crumbling, of, the, guptas, the, huna, invasions, are, said, to, have, seriously, damaged, india, s, trade, with, europe, and, central, asia, in, particular, indo, roman, trade, relations, which, the, gupta, empire, had, greatly, benefited, from, the, guptas, had, been, exporting, numerous, luxury, products, such, as, silk, leather, goods, fur, iron, products, ivory, pearl, and, pepper, from, centres, such, as, nasik, paithan, pataliputra, and, benares, the, huna, invasion, probably, disrupted, these, trade, relations, and, the, tax, revenues, that, came, with, them, furthermore, indian, urban, culture, was, left, in, decline, and, buddhism, gravely, weakened, by, the, destruction, of, monasteries, and, the, killing, of, monks, by, the, hand, of, the, vehemently, anti, buddhist, shaivist, huna, king, mihirakula, started, to, collapse, great, centres, of, learning, were, destroyed, such, as, the, city, of, taxila, bringing, cultural, regression, during, their, rule, of, 60, years, the, alchons, are, said, to, have, altered, the, hierarchy, of, ruling, families, and, the, indian, caste, system, for, example, the, hunas, are, often, said, to, have, become, the, precursors, of, the, rajputs, the, succession, of, the, 6th, century, guptas, is, not, entirely, clear, but, the, tail, end, recognised, ruler, of, the, dynasty, s, main, line, was, king, vishnugupta, reigning, from, 540, to, 550, in, addition, to, the, huna, invasion, the, factors, which, contribute, to, the, decline, of, the, empire, include, competition, from, the, vakatakas, and, the, rise, of, yashodharman, in, malwa, the, last, known, inscription, by, a, gupta, emperor, is, from, the, reign, of, vishnugupta, the, damudarpur, copper, plate, inscription, in, which, he, makes, a, land, grant, in, the, area, of, kotivarsha, bangarh, in, west, bengal, in, 542, 543, ce, this, follows, the, occupation, of, most, of, northern, and, central, india, by, the, aulikara, king, yashodharman, c, 532, ce, a, 2019, study, by, archaeologist, shanker, sharma, has, concluded, that, the, cause, of, the, gupta, empire, s, downfall, was, a, devastating, flood, which, happened, around, the, middle, of, the, 6th, century, in, uttar, pradesh, and, bihar, in, the, heart, of, the, former, gupta, empire, in, the, gangetic, region, the, guptas, were, succeeded, by, the, maukhari, dynasty, and, the, pushyabhuti, dynasty, the, coinage, of, the, maukharis, and, pushyabhutis, followed, the, silver, coin, type, of, the, guptas, with, portrait, of, the, ruler, in, profile, although, facing, in, the, reverse, direction, compared, to, the, guptas, a, possible, symbol, of, antagonism, and, the, peacock, on, the, reverse, the, brahmi, legend, being, kept, except, for, the, name, of, the, ruler, in, the, western, regions, they, were, succeeded, by, gurjaradesa, the, gurjara, pratiharas, and, later, the, chaulukya, paramara, dynasties, who, issued, so, called, indo, sasanian, coinage, on, the, model, of, the, coinage, of, the, sasanian, empire, which, had, been, introduced, in, india, by, the, alchon, huns, in, contrast,
