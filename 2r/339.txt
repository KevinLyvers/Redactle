the, age, of, discovery, also, known, as, the, age, of, exploration, was, part, of, the, early, modern, period, and, largely, overlapping, with, the, age, of, sail, it, was, a, period, from, approximately, the, late, 15th, century, to, the, 17th, century, during, which, seafarers, from, a, number, of, european, countries, explored, colonized, and, conquered, regions, across, the, globe, the, age, of, discovery, was, a, transformative, period, in, world, history, when, previously, isolated, parts, of, the, world, became, connected, to, form, the, world, system, and, laid, the, groundwork, for, globalization, the, extensive, overseas, exploration, particularly, the, opening, of, maritime, routes, to, the, indies, and, the, european, colonization, of, the, americas, by, the, spanish, and, portuguese, later, joined, by, the, english, french, and, dutch, spurred, in, the, international, global, trade, the, interconnected, global, economy, of, the, 21st, century, has, its, origins, in, the, expansion, of, trade, networks, during, this, era, the, exploration, also, created, colonial, empires, and, marked, an, increased, adoption, of, colonialism, as, a, government, policy, in, several, european, states, as, such, it, is, sometimes, synonymous, with, the, first, wave, of, european, colonization, the, colonization, reshaped, power, dynamics, causing, geopolitical, shifts, in, europe, and, creating, new, centers, of, power, beyond, europe, having, set, human, history, on, the, global, common, course, the, legacy, of, the, age, still, shapes, the, world, today, european, oceanic, exploration, started, with, the, maritime, expeditions, of, portugal, to, the, canary, islands, in, 1336, and, later, with, the, portuguese, discoveries, of, the, atlantic, archipelagos, of, madeira, and, azores, the, coast, of, west, africa, in, 1434, and, the, establishment, of, the, sea, route, to, india, in, 1498, by, vasco, da, gama, which, initiated, the, portuguese, maritime, and, trade, presence, in, kerala, and, the, indian, ocean, during, the, age, of, discovery, spain, sponsored, and, financed, the, transatlantic, voyages, of, the, italian, navigator, christopher, columbus, which, from, 1492, to, 1504, marked, the, start, of, colonization, in, the, americas, and, the, expedition, of, the, portuguese, explorer, ferdinand, magellan, to, open, a, route, from, the, atlantic, ocean, to, the, pacific, which, later, achieved, the, first, circumnavigation, of, the, globe, between, 1519, and, 1522, these, spanish, expeditions, significantly, impacted, the, european, perceptions, of, the, world, these, discoveries, led, to, numerous, naval, expeditions, across, the, atlantic, indian, and, pacific, oceans, and, land, expeditions, in, the, americas, asia, africa, and, australia, that, continued, into, the, late, 19th, century, followed, by, the, exploration, of, the, polar, regions, in, the, 20th, century, european, exploration, initiated, the, columbian, exchange, between, the, old, world, europe, asia, and, africa, and, the, new, world, the, americas, and, australia, this, exchange, involved, the, transfer, of, plants, animals, human, populations, including, slaves, communicable, diseases, and, culture, across, the, eastern, and, western, hemispheres, the, age, of, discovery, and, european, exploration, involved, mapping, of, the, world, shaping, a, new, worldview, and, facilitating, contact, with, distant, civilizations, the, continents, drawn, by, european, mapmakers, of, the, age, developed, from, abstract, blobs, into, the, outlines, more, recognizable, to, us, today, simultaneously, the, spread, of, new, diseases, especially, affecting, american, indians, led, to, rapid, population, declines, the, era, saw, widespread, enslavement, exploitation, and, military, conquest, of, native, populations, concurrent, with, the, growing, economic, influence, and, spread, of, western, and, european, culture, science, and, technology, leading, to, a, faster, than, exponential, population, growth, world, wide, the, concept, of, discovery, has, been, scrutinized, critically, highlighting, the, history, of, the, core, term, of, this, periodization, the, term, age, of, discovery, is, in, historical, literature, and, still, commonly, used, j, h, parry, calling, the, period, the, age, of, reconnaissance, argues, that, not, only, was, the, era, one, of, european, explorations, but, it, also, produced, the, expansion, of, geographical, knowledge, and, empirical, science, it, saw, also, the, first, major, victories, of, empirical, inquiry, over, authority, the, beginnings, of, that, close, association, of, science, technology, and, everyday, work, which, is, an, essential, characteristic, of, the, modern, western, world, anthony, pagden, draws, on, the, work, of, edmundo, o, gorman, for, the, statement, that, for, all, europeans, the, events, of, october, 1492, constituted, a, discovery, something, of, which, they, had, no, prior, knowledge, had, suddenly, presented, itself, to, their, gaze, o, gorman, argues, that, the, physical, encounter, with, new, territories, was, less, important, than, the, europeans, effort, to, integrate, this, new, knowledge, into, their, worldview, what, he, calls, the, invention, of, america, pagden, examines, the, origins, of, the, terms, discovery, and, invention, in, english, discovery, and, its, forms, in, romance, languages, derive, from, disco, operio, meaning, to, uncover, to, reveal, to, expose, to, the, gaze, what, was, revealed, existed, previously, few, europeans, during, the, period, used, the, term, invention, for, the, european, encounters, with, the, exception, of, martin, waldseem, ller, whose, map, first, used, the, term, america, a, central, legal, concept, of, the, discovery, doctrine, expounded, by, the, us, supreme, court, in, 1823, draws, on, assertions, of, european, powers, right, to, claim, land, during, their, explorations, the, concept, of, discovery, has, been, used, to, enforce, colonial, claiming, and, discovery, but, has, been, challenged, by, indigenous, peoples, and, researchers, many, indigenous, peoples, have, fundamentally, challenged, the, concept, of, colonial, claiming, of, discovery, over, their, lands, and, people, as, forced, and, negating, indigenous, presence, the, period, alternatively, called, the, age, of, exploration, has, been, scrutinized, through, reflections, on, the, exploration, its, understanding, and, use, has, been, discussed, as, being, framed, and, used, for, colonial, ventures, discrimination, and, exploitation, by, combining, it, with, concepts, such, as, the, frontier, as, in, frontier, thesis, and, manifest, destiny, up, to, the, contemporary, age, of, space, exploration, alternatively, the, term, contact, as, in, first, contact, has, been, used, to, shed, more, light, on, the, age, of, discovery, and, colonialism, using, the, alternative, names, of, age, of, contact, or, contact, period, discussing, it, as, an, unfinished, diverse, project, the, portuguese, began, systematically, exploring, the, atlantic, coast, of, africa, in, 1418, under, the, sponsorship, of, prince, henry, the, navigator, in, 1488, bartolomeu, dias, reached, the, indian, ocean, by, this, route, in, 1492, the, catholic, monarchs, of, spain, funded, genoese, mariner, christopher, columbus, s, italian, cristoforo, colombo, plan, to, sail, west, to, reach, the, indies, by, crossing, the, atlantic, columbus, encountered, a, continent, uncharted, by, europeans, though, it, had, been, explored, and, temporarily, colonized, by, the, norse, 500, years, earlier, later, it, was, called, america, after, amerigo, vespucci, a, trader, working, for, portugal, portugal, quickly, claimed, those, lands, under, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, alc, ovas, but, castile, was, able, to, persuade, the, pope, who, was, castilian, to, issue, four, papal, bulls, to, divide, the, world, into, two, regions, of, exploration, where, each, kingdom, had, exclusive, rights, to, claim, newly, discovered, lands, these, were, modified, by, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, ratified, by, pope, julius, ii, in, 1498, a, portuguese, expedition, commanded, by, vasco, da, gama, reached, india, by, sailing, around, africa, opening, up, direct, trade, with, asia, while, other, exploratory, fleets, were, sent, from, portugal, to, northern, north, america, portuguese, india, armadas, also, extended, this, eastern, oceanic, route, touching, south, america, and, opening, a, circuit, from, the, new, world, to, asia, starting, in, 1500, by, pedro, lvares, cabral, and, explored, islands, in, the, south, atlantic, and, southern, indian, oceans, the, portuguese, sailed, further, eastward, to, the, valuable, spice, islands, in, 1512, landing, in, china, one, year, later, japan, was, reached, by, the, portuguese, in, 1543, in, 1513, spanish, vasco, n, ez, de, balboa, crossed, the, isthmus, of, panama, and, reached, the, other, sea, from, the, new, world, thus, europe, first, received, news, of, the, eastern, and, western, pacific, within, a, one, year, span, around, 1512, east, and, west, exploration, overlapped, in, 1522, when, a, spanish, expedition, sailing, westward, led, by, portuguese, navigator, ferdinand, magellan, and, after, his, death, by, navigator, juan, sebasti, n, elcano, completed, the, first, circumnavigation, of, the, world, spanish, conquistadors, explored, the, interior, of, the, americas, and, some, of, the, south, pacific, islands, their, main, objective, was, to, disrupt, portuguese, trade, in, the, east, from, 1495, the, french, english, and, dutch, entered, the, race, of, exploration, after, learning, of, columbus, exploits, defying, the, iberian, monopoly, on, maritime, trade, by, searching, for, new, routes, the, first, expedition, was, john, cabot, in, 1497, to, the, north, in, the, service, of, england, followed, by, french, expeditions, to, south, america, and, later, to, north, america, later, expeditions, went, to, the, pacific, ocean, around, south, america, and, eventually, by, following, the, portuguese, around, africa, into, the, indian, ocean, discovering, australia, in, 1606, new, zealand, in, 1642, and, hawaii, in, 1778, from, the, 1580s, to, the, 1640s, russians, explored, and, conquered, almost, the, whole, of, siberia, and, alaska, in, the, 1730s, after, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, largely, severed, the, connection, between, europe, and, lands, further, east, christian, europe, was, largely, a, backwater, compared, to, the, arab, world, which, conquered, and, incorporated, large, territories, in, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, the, christian, crusades, to, retake, the, holy, land, from, the, muslims, were, not, a, military, success, but, did, bring, europe, into, contact, with, the, middle, east, and, the, valuable, goods, manufactured, or, traded, there, from, the, 12th, century, the, european, economy, was, transformed, by, the, interconnecting, of, river, and, sea, trade, routes, 345, before, the, 12th, century, an, obstacle, to, trade, east, of, the, strait, of, gibraltar, which, divided, the, mediterranean, from, the, atlantic, ocean, was, muslim, control, of, territory, including, the, iberian, peninsula, and, the, trade, monopolies, of, christian, city, states, on, the, italian, peninsula, especially, venice, and, genoa, economic, growth, of, iberia, followed, the, christian, reconquest, of, al, andalus, in, what, is, now, southern, spain, and, the, siege, of, lisbon, 1147, ad, in, portugal, the, decline, of, fatimid, caliphate, naval, strength, that, started, before, the, first, crusade, helped, the, maritime, italian, states, mainly, venice, genoa, and, pisa, dominate, trade, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, with, merchants, there, becoming, wealthy, and, politically, influential, further, changing, the, mercantile, situation, in, the, east, mediterranean, was, the, waning, of, christian, byzantine, naval, power, following, the, death, of, emperor, manuel, i, komnenos, in, 1180, whose, dynasty, had, made, notable, treaties, and, concessions, with, italian, traders, permitting, the, use, of, byzantine, christian, ports, the, norman, conquest, of, england, in, the, late, 11th, century, allowed, for, peaceful, trade, on, the, north, sea, the, hanseatic, league, a, confederation, of, merchant, guilds, and, their, towns, in, north, germany, along, the, north, sea, and, baltic, sea, was, instrumental, in, commercial, development, of, the, region, in, the, 12th, century, the, regions, of, flanders, hainault, and, brabant, produced, the, finest, quality, textiles, in, northwest, europe, which, encouraged, merchants, from, genoa, and, venice, to, sail, there, from, the, mediterranean, through, the, strait, of, gibraltar, and, up, the, atlantic, coast, 316, 38, nicol, zzo, spinola, made, the, first, recorded, direct, voyage, from, genoa, to, flanders, in, 1277, 328, technological, advancements, that, were, important, to, the, age, of, exploration, were, the, adoption, of, the, magnetic, compass, and, advances, in, ship, design, the, compass, was, an, addition, to, the, ancient, method, of, navigation, based, on, sightings, of, the, sun, and, stars, it, was, invented, during, the, chinese, han, dynasty, and, had, been, used, for, navigation, in, china, by, the, 11th, century, it, was, adopted, by, arab, traders, in, the, indian, ocean, the, compass, spread, to, europe, by, the, late, 12th, or, early, 13th, century, use, of, the, compass, for, navigation, in, the, indian, ocean, was, first, mentioned, in, 1232, 351, 2, the, first, mention, of, use, of, the, compass, in, europe, was, in, 1180, 382, the, europeans, used, a, dry, compass, with, a, needle, on, a, pivot, the, compass, card, was, also, a, european, invention, ships, grew, in, size, required, smaller, crews, and, were, able, to, sail, longer, distances, without, stopping, this, led, to, significant, lower, long, distance, shipping, costs, by, the, 14th, century, 342, cogs, remained, popular, for, trade, because, of, their, low, cost, galleys, were, also, used, in, trade, the, periplus, of, the, erythraean, sea, a, document, from, 40, 60, ad, describes, a, newly, discovered, route, through, the, red, sea, to, india, with, descriptions, of, the, markets, in, towns, around, red, sea, persian, gulf, and, the, indian, ocean, including, along, the, east, coast, of, africa, which, states, for, beyond, these, places, the, unexplored, ocean, curves, around, toward, the, west, and, running, along, by, the, regions, to, the, south, of, aethiopia, and, libya, and, africa, it, mingles, with, the, western, sea, possible, reference, to, the, atlantic, ocean, european, medieval, knowledge, about, asia, beyond, the, reach, of, the, byzantine, empire, was, sourced, in, partial, reports, often, obscured, by, legends, dating, back, from, the, conquests, of, alexander, the, great, and, successors, another, source, was, the, radhanite, jewish, trade, networks, of, merchants, established, as, go, betweens, between, europe, and, the, muslim, world, during, the, time, of, the, crusader, states, in, 1154, the, arab, geographer, muhammad, al, idrisi, created, a, description, of, the, world, and, a, world, map, the, tabula, rogeriana, at, the, court, of, king, roger, ii, of, sicily, but, still, africa, was, only, partially, known, to, either, christians, genoese, and, venetians, or, the, arab, seamen, and, its, southern, extent, unknown, there, were, reports, of, great, african, sahara, but, the, knowledge, was, limited, for, the, europeans, to, the, mediterranean, coast, and, little, else, since, the, arab, blockade, of, north, africa, precluded, exploration, inland, knowledge, about, the, atlantic, african, coast, was, fragmented, and, derived, mainly, from, old, greek, and, roman, maps, based, on, carthaginian, knowledge, including, roman, exploration, of, mauritania, the, red, sea, was, barely, known, and, only, trade, links, with, the, maritime, republics, venice, especially, fostered, collection, of, accurate, maritime, knowledge, indian, ocean, trade, routes, were, sailed, by, arab, traders, by, 1400, a, latin, translation, of, ptolemy, s, geographia, reached, italy, from, constantinople, the, rediscovery, of, roman, geographical, knowledge, was, a, revelation, both, for, map, making, and, worldview, although, reinforcing, the, idea, that, the, indian, ocean, was, landlocked, a, prelude, to, the, age, of, discovery, was, a, series, of, european, expeditions, crossing, eurasia, by, land, in, the, late, middle, ages, the, mongols, had, threatened, europe, but, mongol, states, also, unified, much, of, eurasia, and, from, 1206, on, the, pax, mongolica, allowed, safe, trade, routes, and, communication, lines, from, the, middle, east, to, china, the, close, italian, links, to, the, levant, raised, curiosity, and, commercial, interest, in, countries, which, lay, further, east, there, are, a, few, accounts, of, merchants, from, north, africa, and, the, mediterranean, who, traded, in, the, indian, ocean, in, late, medieval, times, christian, embassies, were, sent, as, far, as, karakorum, during, the, mongol, invasions, of, the, levant, from, which, they, gained, a, greater, understanding, of, the, world, the, first, of, these, travellers, was, giovanni, da, pian, del, carpine, dispatched, by, pope, innocent, iv, to, the, great, khan, who, journeyed, to, mongolia, and, back, from, 1241, to, 1247, russian, prince, yaroslav, of, vladimir, and, his, sons, alexander, nevsky, and, andrey, ii, of, vladimir, travelled, to, the, mongolian, capital, though, having, strong, political, implications, their, journeys, left, no, detailed, accounts, other, travellers, followed, like, french, andr, de, longjumeau, and, flemish, william, of, rubruck, who, reached, china, through, central, asia, marco, polo, a, venetian, merchant, dictated, an, account, of, journeys, throughout, asia, from, 1271, to, 1295, describing, being, a, guest, at, the, yuan, dynasty, court, of, kublai, khan, in, travels, it, was, read, throughout, europe, the, muslim, fleet, guarding, the, strait, of, gibraltar, was, defeated, by, genoa, in, 1291, in, that, year, the, genoese, attempted, their, first, atlantic, exploration, when, merchant, brothers, vadino, and, ugolino, vivaldi, sailed, from, genoa, with, two, galleys, but, disappeared, off, the, moroccan, coast, feeding, fears, of, oceanic, travel, from, 1325, to, 1354, a, moroccan, scholar, from, tangier, ibn, battuta, journeyed, through, north, africa, the, sahara, desert, west, africa, southern, europe, eastern, europe, the, horn, of, africa, the, middle, east, and, asia, having, reached, china, after, returning, he, dictated, an, account, to, a, scholar, he, met, in, granada, the, rihla, the, journey, the, unheralded, source, on, his, adventures, between, 1357, and, 1371, a, book, of, supposed, travels, compiled, by, john, mandeville, acquired, popularity, despite, the, unreliable, and, often, fantastical, nature, of, its, accounts, it, was, used, as, a, reference, for, the, east, egypt, and, the, levant, in, general, asserting, the, old, belief, that, jerusalem, was, the, centre, of, the, world, following, the, period, of, timurid, relations, with, europe, in, 1439, niccol, de, conti, published, an, account, of, his, travels, as, a, muslim, merchant, to, india, and, southeast, asia, in, 1466, 1472, russian, merchant, afanasy, nikitin, of, tver, travelled, to, india, which, he, described, in, his, book, a, journey, beyond, the, three, seas, these, overland, journeys, had, little, immediate, effect, the, mongol, empire, collapsed, almost, as, quickly, as, it, formed, and, soon, the, route, to, the, east, became, more, difficult, and, dangerous, the, black, death, of, the, 14th, century, also, blocked, travel, and, trade, for, a, time, religion, played, a, critical, role, in, motivating, european, expansionism, in, 1487, portuguese, envoys, pero, da, covilh, and, afonso, de, paiva, were, sent, on, a, covert, mission, to, gather, intelligence, on, a, potential, sea, route, to, india, and, inquire, about, prester, john, a, nestorian, patriarch, and, king, believed, to, rule, over, parts, of, the, subcontinent, covilh, was, warmly, received, upon, his, arrival, in, ethiopia, but, forbidden, from, leaving, during, the, middle, ages, the, spread, of, christianity, throughout, europe, fueled, the, desire, to, sermonise, in, lands, beyond, this, evangelical, effort, became, a, significant, part, of, the, military, conquests, of, european, powers, like, portugal, spain, and, france, often, leading, to, the, conversion, of, indigenous, peoples, voluntarily, or, forced, religious, orders, such, as, the, franciscans, dominicans, augustinians, and, jesuits, partook, in, most, missionary, endeavours, in, the, new, world, by, the, late, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, the, latter, s, presence, increased, as, they, sought, to, reassert, their, power, and, revive, the, catholic, culture, of, europe, which, had, been, damaged, by, the, reformation, the, chinese, had, wide, connections, through, trade, in, asia, and, been, sailing, to, arabia, east, africa, and, egypt, since, the, tang, dynasty, ad, 618, 907, between, 1405, 21, the, third, ming, emperor, yongle, sponsored, long, range, tributary, missions, in, the, indian, ocean, under, the, command, of, admiral, zheng, he, these, voyages, did, not, result, in, permanent, links, to, overseas, territories, because, of, isolationist, policy, changes, ending, the, voyages, and, knowledge, of, them, a, large, fleet, of, new, junk, ships, was, prepared, for, the, international, diplomatic, expeditions, the, largest, of, these, junks, that, the, chinese, termed, bao, chuan, treasure, ships, may, have, measured, 121, metres, and, thousands, of, sailors, were, involved, the, first, expedition, departed, in, 1405, at, least, seven, well, documented, expeditions, were, launched, each, bigger, and, more, expensive, than, the, last, the, fleets, visited, arabia, east, africa, india, malay, archipelago, and, thailand, then, called, siam, exchanging, goods, along, the, way, they, presented, gifts, of, gold, silver, porcelain, and, silk, in, return, received, such, novelties, as, ostriches, zebras, camels, ivory, and, giraffes, after, the, emperor, s, death, zheng, he, led, a, final, expedition, departing, from, nanking, in, 1431, and, returning, to, beijing, in, 1433, it, is, likely, this, last, expedition, reached, as, far, as, madagascar, the, travels, were, reported, by, ma, huan, a, muslim, voyager, and, translator, who, accompanied, zheng, he, on, three, of, the, expeditions, his, account, published, as, the, yingya, shenglan, overall, survey, of, the, ocean, s, shores, 1433, the, voyages, had, a, significant, and, lasting, effect, on, the, organization, of, a, maritime, network, using, and, creating, nodes, and, conduits, in, its, wake, thereby, restructuring, international, and, cross, cultural, relationships, and, exchanges, it, was, especially, impactful, as, no, other, polity, had, exerted, naval, dominance, over, all, sectors, of, the, indian, ocean, prior, to, these, voyages, the, ming, promoted, alternative, nodes, as, a, strategy, to, establish, control, over, the, network, for, instance, due, to, chinese, involvement, ports, such, as, malacca, in, southeast, asia, cochin, malabar, coast, and, malindi, swahili, coast, had, grown, as, key, alternatives, to, other, established, ports, the, appearance, of, the, ming, treasure, fleet, generated, and, intensified, competition, among, contending, polities, and, rivals, each, seeking, an, alliance, with, the, ming, the, voyages, brought, about, the, western, ocean, s, regional, integration, and, increase, in, international, circulation, of, people, ideas, and, goods, it, provided, a, platform, for, cosmopolitan, discourses, which, took, place, in, locations, such, as, the, ships, of, the, ming, treasure, fleet, the, ming, capitals, of, nanjing, as, well, as, beijing, and, the, banquet, receptions, organized, by, the, ming, court, for, foreign, representatives, diverse, groups, of, people, from, maritime, countries, congregated, interacted, and, traveled, together, as, the, treasure, fleet, sailed, from, and, to, china, for, the, first, time, the, maritime, region, from, china, to, africa, was, under, the, dominance, of, a, single, imperial, power, and, allowed, for, the, creation, of, a, cosmopolitan, space, these, long, distance, journeys, were, not, followed, up, as, the, ming, dynasty, retreated, in, the, haijin, a, policy, of, isolationism, having, limited, maritime, trade, travels, were, halted, abruptly, after, the, emperor, s, death, as, the, chinese, lost, interest, in, what, they, termed, barbarian, lands, turning, inward, and, successor, emperors, felt, the, expeditions, were, harmful, to, the, chinese, state, hongxi, emperor, ended, further, expeditions, and, xuande, emperor, suppressed, much, of, the, information, about, zheng, he, s, voyages, from, the, 8th, until, the, 15th, century, the, republic, of, venice, and, neighboring, maritime, republics, held, the, monopoly, of, european, trade, with, the, middle, east, the, silk, and, spice, trade, involving, spices, incense, herbs, drugs, and, opium, made, these, mediterranean, city, states, phenomenally, rich, spices, were, among, the, most, expensive, and, demanded, products, of, the, middle, ages, as, they, were, used, in, medieval, medicine, religious, rituals, cosmetics, perfumery, as, well, as, food, additives, and, preservatives, they, were, all, imported, from, asia, and, africa, muslim, traders, dominated, maritime, routes, throughout, the, indian, ocean, tapping, source, regions, in,

breakthrough, was, in, 1488, when, bartolomeu, dias, rounded, the, southern, tip, of, africa, which, he, named, cabo, das, tormentas, cape, of, storms, anchoring, at, mossel, bay, and, then, sailing,

the, cape, was, renamed, by, king, john, ii, of, portugal, the, cape, of, good, hope, because, of, the, great, optimism, engendered, by, the, possibility, of, a, sea, route, to, india, proving, false, the, view, that, had, existed, since, ptolemy, that, the, indian, ocean, was, land, locked, based, on, much, later, stories, of, the, phantom, island, known, as, bacalao, and, the, carvings, on, dighton, rock, some, have, speculated, that, portuguese, explorer, jo, o, vaz, corte, real, discovered, newfoundland, in, 1473, but, the, sources, are, considered, unreliable, portugal, s, iberian, rival, castile, had, begun, to, establish, its, rule, over, the, canary, islands, in, 1402, but, became, distracted, by, internal, iberian, politics, and, the, repelling, of, islamic, invasion, attempts, and, raids, through, most, of, the, 15th, century, late, in, the, century, following, the, unification, of, the, crowns, of, castile, and, aragon, an, emerging, modern, spain, became, fully, committed, to, the, search, for, new, trade, routes, overseas, the, crown, of, aragon, had, been, an, important, maritime, power, in, the, mediterranean, controlling, territories, in, eastern, spain, southwestern, france, major, islands, like, sicily, malta, and, the, kingdom, of, naples, and, sardinia, with, mainland, possessions, as, far, as, greece, in, 1492, the, joint, rulers, conquered, the, moorish, kingdom, of, granada, which, had, been, providing, castile, with, african, goods, through, tribute, and, decided, to, fund, christopher, columbus, s, expedition, in, the, hope, of, bypassing, portugal, s, monopoly, on, west, african, sea, routes, to, reach, the, indies, east, and, south, asia, by, travelling, west, twice, before, in, 1485, and, 1488, columbus, had, presented, the, project, to, king, john, ii, of, portugal, who, rejected, it, on, the, evening, of, 3, august, 1492, columbus, departed, from, palos, de, la, frontera, land, was, sighted, on, 12, october, 1492, and, columbus, called, the, island, one, of, the, islands, now, comprising, the, bahamas, san, salvador, in, what, he, thought, to, be, the, east, indies, columbus, explored, the, northeast, coast, of, cuba, and, the, northern, coast, of, hispaniola, by, 5, december, he, was, received, by, the, native, cacique, guacanagari, who, gave, him, permission, to, leave, some, of, his, men, behind, columbus, left, 39, men, and, founded, the, settlement, of, la, navidad, in, what, is, now, haiti, before, returning, to, spain, he, kidnapped, some, ten, to, twenty, five, natives, and, took, them, back, with, him, only, seven, or, eight, of, the, native, indians, arrived, in, spain, alive, but, they, made, an, impression, on, seville, on, 15, march, 1493, he, arrived, in, barcelona, where, he, reported, to, queen, isabella, and, king, ferdinand, word, of, his, discovery, of, new, lands, rapidly, spread, throughout, europe, columbus, and, other, spanish, explorers, were, initially, disappointed, with, their, discoveries, unlike, africa, or, asia, the, caribbean, islanders, had, little, to, trade, with, the, castilian, ships, the, islands, thus, became, the, focus, of, colonization, efforts, it, was, not, until, the, continent, itself, was, explored, that, spain, found, the, wealth, it, had, sought, shortly, after, columbus, s, return, from, what, would, later, be, called, the, west, indies, a, division, of, influence, became, necessary, to, avoid, conflict, between, the, spanish, and, portuguese, on, 4, may, 1493, two, months, after, columbus, s, arrival, the, catholic, monarchs, received, a, bull, inter, caetera, from, pope, alexander, vi, stating, all, lands, west, and, south, of, a, pole, to, pole, line, 100, leagues, west, and, south, of, the, azores, or, the, cape, verde, islands, should, belong, to, castile, and, later, all, mainlands, and, islands, then, belonging, to, india, it, did, not, mention, portugal, which, could, not, claim, newly, discovered, lands, east, of, the, line, king, john, ii, of, portugal, was, displeased, with, the, arrangement, feeling, that, it, gave, him, far, too, little, land, preventing, him, from, reaching, india, his, main, goal, he, then, negotiated, directly, with, king, ferdinand, and, queen, isabella, of, spain, to, move, the, line, west, and, allowing, him, to, claim, newly, discovered, lands, east, of, it, in, 1494, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, divided, the, world, between, portugal, and, spain, portugal, gained, control, over, africa, asia, and, eastern, south, america, brazil, encompassing, everything, outside, europe, east, of, a, line, drawn, 370, leagues, west, of, the, cape, verde, islands, already, portuguese, the, spanish, castile, received, everything, west, of, this, line, including, the, islands, discovered, by, columbus, on, his, first, voyage, named, in, the, treaty, as, cipangu, and, antilia, cuba, and, hispaniola, the, dividing, line, situated, about, halfway, between, portuguese, cape, verde, and, spanish, discoveries, in, the, caribbean, split, the, known, world, of, atlantic, islands, evenly, in, 1500, pedro, lvares, cabral, initially, considering, the, brazilian, coast, as, a, large, island, claimed, it, for, portugal, east, of, the, dividing, line, this, claim, was, acknowledged, by, the, spanish, cabral, heading, towards, india, followed, a, corridor, in, the, atlantic, negotiated, by, the, treaty, for, favorable, winds, while, some, speculate, earlier, secret, portuguese, discovery, of, brazil, there, is, no, credible, evidence, for, this, similarly, suspicions, about, duarte, pacheco, pereira, alleged, 1498, discovery, lack, credibility, among, historians, later, the, spanish, territory, would, prove, to, include, huge, areas, of, the, continental, mainland, of, north, and, south, america, though, portuguese, controlled, brazil, would, expand, across, the, line, and, settlements, by, other, european, powers, ignored, the, treaty, little, of, the, divided, area, had, actually, been, seen, by, europeans, as, it, was, only, divided, by, a, geographical, definition, rather, than, control, on, the, ground, the, desire, to, compete, with, the, ottoman, empire, and, columbus, s, first, voyage, in, 1492, spurred, further, maritime, exploration, and, from, 1497, several, other, explorers, headed, west, that, year, john, cabot, italian, giovanni, caboto, also, a, commissioned, italian, got, letters, patent, from, king, henry, vii, of, england, sailing, from, bristol, probably, backed, by, the, local, society, of, merchant, venturers, cabot, crossed, the, atlantic, from, a, northerly, latitude, hoping, the, voyage, to, the, west, indies, would, be, shorter, and, made, landfall, somewhere, in, north, america, possibly, newfoundland, in, 1499, jo, o, fernandes, lavrador, was, licensed, by, the, king, of, portugal, and, together, with, pero, de, barcelos, they, first, sighted, labrador, which, was, granted, and, named, after, him, after, returning, he, possibly, went, to, bristol, to, sail, in, the, name, of, england, between, 1499, and, 1502, the, brothers, gaspar, and, miguel, corte, real, explored, and, named, the, coasts, of, greenland, and, newfoundland, both, explorations, are, noted, in, the, 1502, cantino, planisphere, in, 1497, newly, crowned, king, manuel, i, of, portugal, sent, an, exploratory, fleet, eastwards, fulfilling, his, predecessor, s, project, of, finding, a, route, to, the, indies, in, july, 1499, news, spread, that, the, portuguese, had, reached, the, true, indies, as, a, letter, was, dispatched, by, the, portuguese, king, to, the, spanish, catholic, monarchs, the, third, expedition, by, columbus, in, 1498, was, the, beginning, of, the, first, successful, castilian, spanish, colonization, in, the, west, indies, on, the, island, of, hispaniola, despite, growing, doubts, columbus, refused, to, accept, he, had, not, reached, the, indies, during, the, voyage, he, discovered, the, mouth, of, the, orinoco, river, on, the, north, coast, of, south, america, now, venezuela, and, thought, that, the, huge, quantity, of, fresh, water, coming, from, it, could, only, be, from, a, continental, land, mass, which, he, was, certain, was, the, asian, mainland, as, shipping, between, seville, and, the, west, indies, grew, knowledge, of, the, caribbean, islands, central, america, and, the, northern, coast, of, south, america, grew, one, of, these, spanish, fleets, that, of, alonso, de, ojeda, and, amerigo, vespucci, in, 1499, 1500, reached, land, at, the, coast, of, what, is, now, guyana, when, the, two, explorers, seem, to, have, separated, in, opposite, directions, vespucci, sailed, southward, discovering, the, mouth, of, the, amazon, river, in, july, 1499, and, reaching, 6, s, in, present, day, north, east, brazil, before, turning, around, in, the, beginning, of, 1500, vicente, y, ez, pinzon, was, blown, off, course, by, a, storm, and, reached, what, is, now, the, northeast, coast, of, brazil, on, 26, january, 1500, exploring, as, far, south, as, the, present, day, state, of, pernambuco, his, fleet, was, the, first, to, fully, enter, the, amazon, river, estuary, which, he, named, r, o, santa, mar, a, de, la, mar, dulce, saint, mary, s, river, of, the, freshwater, sea, the, land, was, too, far, east, for, the, castilians, to, claim, under, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, but, the, discovery, created, castilian, interest, with, a, second, voyage, by, pinzon, in, 1508, the, pinz, n, sol, s, voyage, an, expedition, that, coasted, the, northern, coast, to, the, central, american, coastal, mainland, in, search, of, a, passage, to, the, east, and, a, voyage, in, 1515, 16, by, a, navigator, of, the, 1508, expedition, juan, d, az, de, sol, s, the, 1515, 16, expedition, was, spurred, on, by, reports, of, portuguese, exploration, of, the, region, see, below, it, ended, when, de, sol, s, and, some, of, his, crew, disappeared, when, exploring, the, river, plata, in, a, boat, but, what, they, found, reignited, spanish, interest, and, colonization, began, in, 1531, in, april, 1500, the, second, portuguese, india, armada, headed, by, pedro, lvares, cabral, with, a, crew, of, expert, captains, encountered, the, brazilian, coast, as, it, swung, westward, in, the, atlantic, while, performing, a, large, volta, do, mar, to, avoid, becalming, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, on, 21, april, 1500, a, mountain, was, seen, and, named, monte, pascoal, and, on, 22, april, cabral, landed, on, the, coast, on, 25, april, the, entire, fleet, sailed, into, the, harbour, they, named, porto, seguro, port, secure, cabral, perceived, that, the, new, land, lay, east, of, the, line, of, tordesillas, and, sent, an, envoy, to, portugal, with, the, discovery, in, letters, including, the, letter, of, pero, vaz, de, caminha, believing, the, land, to, be, an, island, he, named, it, ilha, de, vera, cruz, island, of, the, true, cross, some, historians, have, suggested, that, the, portuguese, may, have, encountered, the, south, american, bulge, earlier, while, sailing, the, volta, do, mar, hence, the, insistence, of, john, ii, in, moving, the, line, west, of, tordesillas, in, 1494, so, his, landing, in, brazil, may, not, have, been, an, accident, although, john, s, motivation, may, have, just, been, to, claiming, new, lands, in, the, atlantic, easier, from, the, east, coast, the, fleet, then, turned, eastward, to, resume, the, journey, to, the, southern, tip, of, africa, and, india, cabral, was, the, first, captain, to, touch, four, continents, leading, the, first, expedition, that, connected, and, united, europe, africa, the, new, world, and, asia, at, the, invitation, of, king, manuel, i, of, portugal, amerigo, vespucci, participated, as, observer, in, these, exploratory, voyages, to, the, east, coast, of, south, america, the, expeditions, became, widely, known, in, europe, after, two, accounts, attributed, to, him, published, between, 1502, and, 1504, suggested, the, newly, discovered, lands, were, not, the, indies, but, a, new, world, the, mundus, novus, this, is, also, the, latin, title, of, a, contemporary, document, based, on, vespucci, letters, to, lorenzo, di, pierfrancesco, de, medici, which, had, become, popular, in, europe, it, was, soon, understood, that, columbus, had, not, reached, asia, but, found, a, new, continent, the, americas, the, americas, were, named, in, 1507, by, cartographers, martin, waldseem, ller, and, matthias, ringmann, after, amerigo, vespucci, from, 1501, to, 1502, one, of, these, portuguese, expeditions, led, by, gon, alo, coelho, and, or, andr, gon, alves, or, gaspar, de, lemos, sailed, south, along, the, coast, of, south, america, to, the, bay, of, present, day, rio, de, janeiro, vespucci, s, account, states, that, the, expedition, reached, the, latitude, south, pole, elevation, 52, s, in, the, cold, latitudes, of, what, is, now, southern, patagonia, before, turning, back, vespucci, wrote, that, they, headed, toward, the, southwest, and, south, following, a, long, unbending, coastline, apparently, coincident, with, the, southern, south, american, coast, this, seems, controversial, since, he, changed, part, of, his, description, in, the, subsequent, letter, stating, a, shift, from, about, 32, s, southern, brazil, to, south, southeast, to, open, sea, maintaining, that, they, reached, 50, 52, s, in, 1503, binot, paulmier, de, gonneville, challenging, the, portuguese, policy, of, mare, clausum, led, one, of, the, earliest, french, normand, and,

the, world, voyage, gave, spain, valuable, knowledge, of, the, world, and, its, oceans, which, later, helped, in, the, exploration, and, settlement, of, the, philippines, although, this, was, not, a, realistic, alternative, to, the, portuguese, route, around, africa, the, strait, of, magellan, was, too, far, south, and, the, pacific, ocean, too, vast, to, cover, in, a, single, trip, from, spain, successive, spanish, expeditions, used, this, information, to, explore, the, pacific, ocean, and, discovered, routes, that, opened, up, trade, between, acapulco, new, spain, present, day, mexico, and,

in, the, indies, it, is, so, beautiful, and, has, such, fine, buildings, that, it, would, be, remarkable, even, in, spain, after, the, spanish, had, sealed, the, conquest, of, peru, jauja, in, fertile, mantaro, valley, was, established, as, peru, s, provisional, capital, but, it, was, too, far, up, in, the, mountains, and, pizarro, founded, the, city, of, lima, on, 18, january, 1535, which, pizarro, considered, one, of, the, most, important, acts, in, his, life, in, 1543, three, portuguese, traders, accidentally, became, the, first, westerners, to, reach, and, trade, with, japan, according, to, fern, o, mendes, pinto, who, claimed, to, be, in, this, journey, they, arrived, at, tanegashima, where, the, locals, were, impressed, by, firearms, that, would, be, immediately, made, by, the, japanese, on, a, large, scale, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, philippines, was, ordered, by, philip, ii, of, spain, and, andr, s, de, urdaneta, was, the, designated, commander, urdaneta, agreed, to, accompany, the, expedition, but, refused, to, command, and, miguel, l, pez, de, legazpi, was, appointed, instead, the, expedition, set, sail, on, november, 1564, after, spending, some, time, on, the, islands, legazpi, sent, urdaneta, back, to, find, a, better, return, route, urdaneta, set, sail, from, san, miguel, on, the, island, of, cebu, on, 1, june, 1565, but, was, obliged, to, sail, as, far, as, 38, degrees, north, latitude, to, obtain, favorable, winds, he, reasoned, that, the, trade, winds, of, the, pacific, might, move, in, a, gyre, as, the, atlantic, winds, did, if, in, the, atlantic, ships, made, the, volta, do, mar, to, pick, up, winds, that, would, bring, them, back, from, madeira, then, he, reasoned, by, sailing, far, to, the, north, before, heading, east, he, would, pick, up, trade, winds, to, bring, him, back, to, north, america, his, hunch, paid, off, and, he, hit, the, coast, near, cape, mendocino, california, then, followed, the, coast, south, the, ship, reached, the, port, of, acapulco, on, 8, october, 1565, having, traveled, 12, 000, miles, 19, 000, kilometres, in, 130, days, fourteen, of, his, crew, died, only, urdaneta, and, felipe, de, salcedo, nephew, of, l, pez, de, legazpi, had, strength, enough, to, cast, the, anchors, thus, a, cross, pacific, spanish, route, was, established, between, mexico, and, the, philippines, for, a, long, time, these, routes, were, used, by, the, manila, galleons, thereby, creating, a, trade, link, joining, china, the, americas, and, europe, via, the, combined, trans, pacific, and, trans, atlantic, routes, european, nations, outside, iberia, did, not, recognize, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, between, portugal, and, castile, nor, did, they, recognize, pope, alexander, vi, s, donation, of, the, spanish, finds, in, the, new, world, france, the, netherlands, and, england, each, had, a, long, maritime, tradition, and, had, been, engaging, in, privateering, despite, iberian, protections, the, new, technologies, and, maps, soon, made, their, way, north, after, the, marriage, of, henry, viii, of, england, and, catherine, of, aragon, failed, to, produce, a, male, heir, and, henry, failed, to, obtain, a, papal, dispensation, to, annul, his, marriage, he, broke, with, the, roman, catholic, church, and, established, himself, as, head, of, the, church, of, england, this, added, religious, conflict, to, political, conflict, when, much, of, the, netherlands, became, protestant, it, sought, political, and, religious, independence, from, catholic, spain, in, 1568, the, dutch, rebelled, against, the, rule, of, philip, ii, of, spain, leading, to, the, eighty, years, war, war, between, england, and, spain, also, broke, out, in, 1580, philip, ii, became, king, of, portugal, as, heir, to, its, crown, although, he, ruled, portugal, and, its, empire, as, separate, from, the, spanish, empire, the, union, of, the, crowns, produced, a, catholic, superpower, which, england, and, the, netherlands, challenged, in, the, eighty, year, dutch, war, of, independence, philip, s, troops, conquered, the, important, trading, cities, of, bruges, and, ghent, antwerp, then, the, most, important, port, in, the, world, fell, in, 1585, the, protestant, population, was, given, two, years, to, settle, affairs, before, leaving, the, city, many, settled, in, amsterdam, those, were, mainly, skilled, craftsmen, rich, merchants, of, the, port, cities, and, refugees, that, fled, religious, persecution, particularly, sephardi, jews, from, portugal, and, spain, and, later, the, huguenots, from, france, the, pilgrim, fathers, also, spent, time, there, before, going, to, the, new, world, this, mass, immigration, was, an, important, driving, force, a, small, port, in, 1585, amsterdam, quickly, transformed, into, one, of, the, most, important, commercial, centres, in, the, world, after, the, failure, of, the, spanish, armada, in, 1588, there, was, a, huge, expansion, of, maritime, trade, even, though, the, defeat, of, the, english, armada, would, confirm, the, naval, supremacy, of, the, spanish, navy, over, the, emergent, competitors, dutch, maritime, power, rose, quickly, as, dutch, sailors, skilled, in, navigation, and, mapmaking, engaged, with, portuguese, voyages, in, 1592, cornelis, de, houtman, gathered, information, on, the, spice, islands, in, lisbon, the, same, year, jan, huyghen, van, linschoten, published, a, detailed, travel, report, in, amsterdam, providing, navigation, instructions, for, reaching, the, east, indies, and, japan, following,

south, america, where, more, wealth, had, been, found, these, other, european, expeditions, were, initially, motivated, by, the, same, idea, as, columbus, namely, a, westerly, shortcut, to, the, asian, mainland, after, the, existence, of, another, ocean, the, pacific, was, confirmed, by, balboa, in, 1513, there, still, remained, the, motivation, of, potentially, finding, an, oceanic, northwest, passage, to, asian, trade, this, was, not, discovered, until, the, early, twentieth, century, but, other, possibilities, were, found, although, nothing, on, the, scale, of, the, spectacular, ones, of, the, spanish, in, the, early, 17th, century, colonists, from, a, number, of, northern, european, states, began, to, settle, on, the, east, coast, of, north, america, between,

down, the, amur, and, finally, discovered, the, mouth, of, that, great, river, from, land, since, his, cossacks, provoked, the, enmity, of, the, locals, behind, poyarkov, chose, a, different, way, back, they, built, boats, and, in, 1645, sailed, along, the, sea, of, okhotsk, coast, to, the, ulya, river, and, spent, the, next, winter, in, the, huts, that, had, been, built, by, ivan, moskvitin,

time, they, rounded, cape, dezhnyov, thus, becoming, the, first, explorers, to, pass, through, the, bering, strait, and, to, discover, chukotka, and, the, bering, sea, all, their, kochi, and, most, of, their, men, including, popov, himself, were, lost, in, storms, and, clashes, with, the, natives, a, small, group, led, by, dezhnyov, reached, the, mouth, of, the, anadyr, river, and, sailed, up, it, in, 1649, having, built, new, boats, from, the, wreckage, they, founded, anadyrsk, and, were, stranded, there, until, stadukhin, found, them, coming, from, kolyma, by, land, subsequently,

atop, his, earlier, pioneering, charts, ivanov, is, credited, with, creation, of, the, early, map, of, chukotka, and, the, bering, strait, which, was, the, first, to, show, on, paper, very, schematically, the, yet, undiscovered, wrangel, island, both, diomede, islands, and, alaska, based, on, the, data, collected, from, the, natives, of, chukotka, by, the, mid, 17th, century, russians, established, the, borders, of, their, country, close, to, modern, ones, and, explored, almost, the, whole, of, siberia, except, the, eastern, kamchatka, and, some, regions, north, of, the, arctic, circle, the, conquest, of, kamchatka, later, would, be, achieved, in, the, early, 1700s, by, vladimir, atlasov, while, the, discovery, of, the, arctic, coastline, and, alaska, would, be, completed, by, the, great, northern, expedition, in, 1733, 1743, european, overseas, expansion, led, to, contact, between, the, old, and, new, worlds, producing, the, columbian, exchange, it, started, the, global, silver, trade, and, led, to, direct, european, involvement, in, the, chinese, porcelain, trade, it, involved, the, transfer, of, goods, unique, to, one, hemisphere, to, another, europeans, brought, cattle, horses, and, sheep, to, the, new, world, and, from, the, new, world, europeans, received, tobacco, potatoes, tomatoes, and, maize, other, items, and, commodities, becoming, important, in, global, trade, were, the, tobacco, sugarcane, and, cotton, crops, of, the, americas, along, with, the, gold, and, silver, brought, from, the, american, continent, not, only, to, europe, but, elsewhere, in, the, old, world, the, formation, of, new, transoceanic, links, and, expansion, of, european, influence, led, to, the, age, of, imperialism, which, began, during, the, age, of, discovery, during, which, colonial, powers, from, europe, colonized, most, territory, on, the, planet, european, demand, for, trade, commodities, colonies, and, slaves, had, a, drastic, impact, on, the, rest, of, the, world, during, european, colonization, of, the, americas, european, colonial, powers, conquered, and, colonized, numerous, indigenous, nations, and, cultures, and, conducted, numerous, conversions, and, attempts, at, cultural, assimilation, both, voluntary, or, forced, combined, with, the, introduction, of, infectious, diseases, from, europe, these, events, led, to, a, drastic, decrease, of, the, indigenous, american, population, indigenous, accounts, of, european, colonization, were, summarized, by, scholar, peter, mancall, the, arrival, of, europeans, brought, death, displacement, sorrow, and, despair, to, native, americans, in, some, areas, like, north, america, central, america, australia, new, zealand, and, argentina, indigenous, peoples, were, badly, treated, driven, off, their, lands, and, reduced, to, dependent, minorities, in, the, territory, similarly, in, east, and, west, africa, local, states, supplied, the, appetite, of, european, slave, traders, changing, the, complexion, of, coastal, african, states, and, fundamentally, altering, the, nature, of, slavery, in, africa, causing, impacts, on, societies, and, economies, deep, inland, in, north, america, there, were, many, conflicts, between, europeans, and, indigenous, peoples, the, europeans, had, many, advantages, over, the, indigenous, people, introduced, eurasian, diseases, wiped, out, 50, 90, of, the, indigenous, population, because, they, had, not, been, exposed, before, and, lacked, acquired, immunity, maize, and, manioc, were, introduced, into, africa, in, the, 16th, century, by, the, portuguese, they, are, now, important, staple, foods, replacing, native, african, crops, alfred, w, crosby, speculated, that, increased, production, of, maize, manioc, and, other, new, world, crops, led, to, heavier, concentrations, of, population, in, the, areas, from, which, slavers, captured, their, victims, in, the, global, silver, trade, the, ming, dynasty, was, stimulated, by, trade, with, the, portuguese, spanish, and, dutch, although, global, much, of, that, silver, ended, up, with, the, chinese, and, china, dominated, silver, imports, between, 1600, and, 1800, china, received, 100, tons, of, silver, on, average, per, year, a, large, populace, near, the, lower, yangtze, averaged, hundreds, of, taels, of, silver, per, household, in, the, late, 16th, century, more, than, 150, 000, tons, of, silver, were, shipped, from, potos, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, from, 1500, to, 1800, mexico, and, peru, produced, about, 80, of, the, world, s, silver, with, more, than, 30, of, it, eventually, ending, up, in, china, largely, because, european, merchants, used, it, to, purchase, exotic, chinese, commodities, in, the, late, 16th, and, early, 17th, century, japan, was, exporting, heavily, into, china, and, foreign, trade, at, large, trade, with, european, powers, and, the, japanese, brought, in, significant, amounts, of, silver, which, then, replaced, copper, and, paper, banknotes, as, the, common, medium, of, exchange, in, china, during, the, last, decades, of, the, ming, dynasty, the, flow, of, silver, into, china, was, greatly, diminished, thereby, undermining, state, revenues, and, the, entire, ming, economy, this, damage, to, the, economy, was, compounded, by, the, effects, on, agriculture, of, the, incipient, little, ice, age, natural, calamities, crop, failure, and, sudden, epidemics, the, ensuing, breakdown, of, authority, and, people, s, livelihoods, allowed, rebel, leaders, such, as, li, zicheng, to, challenge, ming, authority, new, crops, that, had, come, to, asia, from, the, americas, via, the, spanish, colonizers, in, the, 16th, century, contributed, to, the, asia, s, population, growth, although, the, bulk, of, imports, to, china, were, silver, the, chinese, also, purchased, new, world, crops, from, the, spanish, empire, this, included, sweet, potatoes, maize, and, peanuts, foods, that, could, be, cultivated, in, lands, where, traditional, chinese, staple, crops, wheat, millet, and, rice, could, not, grow, hence, facilitating, a, rise, in, the, population, of, china, in, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, rice, had, become, the, major, staple, crop, of, the, poor, after, sweet, potatoes, were, introduced, to, china, around, 1560, it, gradually, became, the, traditional, food, of, the, lower, classes, the, arrival, of, the, portuguese, to, japan, in, 1543, initiated, the, nanban, trade, period, with, the, japanese, adopting, technologies, and, cultural, practices, like, the, arquebus, european, style, cuirasses, european, ships, christianity, decorative, art, and, language, after, the, chinese, had, banned, direct, trade, by, chinese, merchants, with, japan, the, portuguese, filled, this, commercial, vacuum, as, intermediaries, the, portuguese, bought, chinese, silk, and, sold, it, to, the, japanese, in, return, for, japanese, mined, silver, since, silver, was, more, highly, valued, in, china, the, portuguese, could, then, use, japanese, silver, to, buy, even, larger, stocks, of, chinese, silk, by, 1573, after, the, spanish, established, a, trading, base, in, manila, the, portuguese, intermediary, trade, was, trumped, by, the, prime, source, of, incoming, silver, to, china, from, the, spanish, americas, although, china, acted, as, the, cog, running, the, wheel, of, global, trade, during, the, 16th, to, 18th, centuries, japan, s, huge, contribution, of, silver, exports, to, china, were, critical, to, the, world, economy, and, china, s, liquidity, and, success, with, the, commodity, as, a, wider, variety, of, global, luxury, commodities, entered, the, european, markets, by, sea, previous, european, markets, for, luxury, goods, stagnated, the, atlantic, trade, largely, supplanted, pre, existing, italian, and, german, trading, powers, which, had, relied, on, their, baltic, russian, and, islamic, trade, links, the, new, commodities, also, caused, social, change, as, sugar, spices, silks, and, chinawares, entered, the, luxury, markets, of, europe, the, european, economic, centre, shifted, from, the, mediterranean, to, western, europe, the, city, of, antwerp, part, of, the, duchy, of, brabant, became, the, centre, of, the, entire, international, economy, and, the, richest, city, in, europe, centred, in, antwerp, first, and, then,

silk, and, porcelain, adapted, to, meet, european, tastes, the, chinese, export, porcelains, were, held, in, such, great, esteem, in, europe, that, in, english, china, became, a, commonly, used, synonym, for, porcelain, kraak, porcelain, was, among, the, first, chinese, ware, to, arrive, in, europe, in, significant, quantities, only, the, richest, could, afford, these, early, imports, soon, the, dutch, east, india, company, established, trade, with, the, east, having, imported, 6, million, porcelain, items, from, china, to, europe, between, the, years, 1602, 82, kraak, mainly, the, blue, and, white, porcelain, was, imitated, all, over, the, world, by, potters, in, arita, japan, and, persia, where, dutch, merchants, turned, when, the, fall, of, the, ming, dynasty, rendered, chinese, originals, unavailable, and, ultimately, in, delftware, dutch, and, later, english, delftware, inspired, by, chinese, designs, persisted, from, about, 1630, to, the, mid, 18th, century, alongside, european, patterns, antonio, de, morga, 1559, 1636, a, spanish, official, in, manila, listed, an, extensive, inventory, of, goods, that, were, traded, by, ming, china, at, the, turn, of, the, 16th,

and, borneo, to, take, advantage, of, the, new, commercial, opportunities, the, increase, in, gold, and, silver, experienced, by, spain, coincided, with, a, major, inflationary, cycle, within, spain, and, europe, known, as, the, price, revolution, spain, had, amassed, large, quantities, of, gold, and, silver, from, the, new, world, in, the, 1540s, large, scale, extraction, of, silver, from,
