disintegration, of, spanish, america, the, spanish, american, wars, of, independence, spanish, guerras, de, independencia, hispanoamericanas, took, place, throughout, spanish, america, during, the, early, 19th, century, with, the, aim, of, political, independence, from, spanish, rule, struggles, for, sovereignty, in, both, hemispheres, began, shortly, after, the, outbreak, of, the, peninsular, war, as, a, front, in, the, larger, napoleonic, wars, between, royalists, who, favored, a, unitary, monarchy, and, patriots, who, favored, either, plural, monarchies, or, republics, thus, the, strict, period, of, military, campaigns, would, go, from, the, battle, of, chacaltaya, 1809, in, present, day, bolivia, to, the, battle, of, tampico, 1829, in, mexico, in, 1808, the, spanish, royal, family, was, forced, by, napoleon, bonaparte, to, abdicate, which, gave, rise, two, years, later, to, an, emergence, of, liberalism, and, desire, for, liberties, throughout, the, spanish, empire, at, first, some, major, cities, or, capitals, formed, local, juntas, on, the, basis, of, laws, from, the, hispanic, tradition, the, violent, conflicts, started, in, 1809, with, short, lived, juntas, established, to, govern, in, chuquisaca, la, paz, and, quito, opposing, the, government, of, the, supreme, central, junta, of, seville, at, the, beginning, of, 1810, new, juntas, appeared, across, spanish, america, when, the, central, junta, fell, to, the, french, invasion, although, various, regions, objected, to, many, crown, policies, there, was, little, interest, in, outright, independence, indeed, there, was, widespread, support, for, the, spanish, central, junta, formed, to, lead, the, resistance, against, the, french, while, some, spanish, americans, believed, that, independence, was, necessary, most, who, initially, supported, the, creation, of, the, new, governments, saw, them, as, a, means, to, preserve, the, region, s, autonomy, from, the, french, although, there, had, been, research, on, the, idea, of, a, separate, spanish, american, creole, identity, separate, from, that, of, iberia, political, independence, was, not, initially, the, aim, of, most, spanish, americans, nor, was, it, necessarily, inevitable, at, the, end, of, 1810, ferdinand, vii, of, spain, captive, was, recognized, by, the, cortes, of, c, diz, and, by, the, governing, juntas, in, the, americas, as, a, king, subordinate, to, popular, sovereignty, the, governing, juntas, across, america, wanted, to, reinstate, ferdinand, vii, as, king, and, refused, to, accept, the, authority, of, the, council, of, regency, that, was, established, with, the, dissolution, of, the, supreme, and, central, governmental, junta, of, spain, and, the, indies, in, agreement, on, this, a, military, conflict, arose, between, royalists, and, patriots, over, the, unity, or, independence, of, the, empire, these, juntas, gained, their, own, levels, of, independence, and, autonomy, from, spain, through, declarations, in, 1808, 1812, however, ferdinand, vii, reimposed, absolute, monarchy, in, 1814, with, a, coup, d, tat, following, the, defeat, of, napoleon, and, the, treaty, of, valen, ay, he, was, able, to, defeat, and, repress, the, peninsular, liberals, and, abolished, the, liberal, constitution, of, cadiz, although, he, could, not, defeat, the, revolutionaries, in, spanish, america, who, resisted, and, formed, their, own, national, congresses, the, spanish, navy, had, collapsed, in, the, war, against, napoleon, so, therefore, in, practice, it, did, not, support, the, expeditionary, forces, who, arrived, in, small, groups, in, 1820, the, spanish, army, led, by, rafael, riego, revolted, against, absolutism, restored, the, so, called, trienio, liberal, and, ended, the, threat, of, invasion, against, the, r, o, de, la, plata, resulting, in, royalist, collapse, in, americas, over, the, course, of, the, next, decade, the, patriots, armies, won, major, victories, and, obtained, independence, in, their, respective, countries, spain, did, not, change, the, position, against, separatism, but, the, political, instability, in, spain, without, a, navy, army, or, treasury, convinced, many, spanish, americans, of, the, need, to, formally, establish, independence, from, the, metropole, in, spain, a, french, army, of, the, holy, alliance, invaded, and, supported, the, absolutists, restored, ferdinand, vii, and, occupied, spain, until, 1828, these, conflicts, were, fought, both, as, irregular, warfare, and, conventional, warfare, some, historians, claim, that, the, wars, began, as, localized, civil, wars, that, later, spread, and, expanded, as, secessionist, wars, to, promote, general, independence, from, spanish, rule, this, independence, led, to, the, development, of, new, national, boundaries, based, on, the, colonial, provinces, which, would, form, the, future, independent, countries, that, constituted, contemporary, latin, america, during, the, early, 19th, century, cuba, and, puerto, rico, remained, under, spanish, rule, until, the, 1898, spanish, american, war, the, conflict, resulted, in, the, dissolution, of, the, spanish, monarchy, and, the, creation, of, new, states, the, independence, of, spanish, america, did, not, constitute, an, anticolonial, movement, slavery, was, not, abolished, in, most, new, countries, but, the, new, republics, immediately, left, the, formal, system, of, racial, classification, and, hierarchy, the, caste, system, the, inquisition, and, noble, titles, criollos, of, spanish, descent, born, in, the, new, world, and, mestizos, of, mixed, indigenous, and, european, heritage, replaced, spanish, born, appointees, in, most, political, governments, criollos, remained, at, the, top, of, a, social, structure, that, retained, some, of, its, traditional, features, culturally, if, not, legally, slavery, finally, ended, in, all, of, the, new, nations, for, almost, a, century, thereafter, conservatives, and, liberals, fought, to, reverse, or, to, deepen, the, social, and, political, changes, unleashed, by, those, rebellions, the, spanish, american, independences, had, as, a, direct, consequence, the, forced, displacement, of, the, royalist, spanish, population, that, suffered, a, forced, emigration, during, the, war, and, later, due, to, the, laws, of, expulsion, of, the, spaniards, from, the, new, states, in, the, americas, with, the, purpose, of, consolidating, their, independence, events, in, spanish, america, transpired, in, the, wake, of, the, successful, haitian, revolution, and, transition, to, independence, in, brazil, brazil, s, independence, in, particular, shared, a, common, starting, point, with, that, of, spanish, america, since, both, conflicts, were, triggered, by, napoleon, s, invasion, of, the, iberian, peninsula, which, forced, the, portuguese, royal, family, to, flee, to, brazil, in, 1807, the, process, of, latin, american, independence, took, place, in, the, general, political, and, intellectual, climate, of, popular, sovereignty, that, emerged, from, the, age, of, enlightenment, that, influenced, all, of, the, atlantic, revolutions, including, the, earlier, revolutions, in, the, united, states, and, france, a, more, direct, cause, of, the, spanish, american, wars, of, independence, were, the, unique, developments, occurring, within, the, kingdom, of, spain, triggered, by, the, cortes, of, cadiz, concluding, with, the, emergence, of, the, new, spanish, american, republics, in, the, post, napoleonic, world, political, independence, was, not, necessarily, the, foreordained, outcome, of, the, political, turmoil, in, spanish, america, there, was, little, interest, in, outright, independence, as, historians, r, a, humphreys, and, john, lynch, note, it, is, all, too, easy, to, equate, the, forces, of, discontent, or, even, the, forces, of, change, with, the, forces, of, revolution, since, by, definition, there, was, no, history, of, independence, until, it, happened, when, spanish, american, independence, did, occur, explanations, for, why, it, came, about, have, been, sought, the, latin, american, wars, of, independence, were, essentially, led, by, european, diaspora, against, european, empires, there, are, a, number, of, factors, that, have, been, identified, to, have, provoked, the, independent, movements, first, increasing, control, by, the, crown, of, its, overseas, empire, via, the, bourbon, reforms, of, the, mid, eighteenth, century, introduced, changes, to, the, relationship, of, spanish, americans, to, the, crown, the, language, used, to, describe, the, overseas, empire, shifted, from, kingdoms, with, independent, standing, with, the, crown, to, colonies, subordinate, to, spain, in, an, effort, to, better, control, the, administration, and, economy, of, the, overseas, possessions, the, crown, reintroduced, the, practice, of, appointing, outsiders, almost, all, peninsulars, to, the, royal, offices, throughout, the, empire, this, meant, that, spanish, american, elites, were, thwarted, in, their, expectations, and, ambitions, by, the, crown, s, upending, of, long, standing, practices, of, creole, access, to, office, holding, the, regalist, and, secularizing, policies, of, the, bourbon, monarchy, were, aimed, at, decreasing, the, power, of, the, roman, catholic, church, the, crown, had, already, expelled, the, jesuits, in, 1767, which, saw, many, creole, members, of, the, society, of, jesus, go, into, permanent, exile, by, limiting, the, power, of, the, church, the, crown, attempted, to, centralize, itself, within, the, institutions, of, colonial, latin, america, because, of, the, physical, and, ideological, proximity, that, the, clergy, had, they, could, directly, influence, and, dictate, the, interactions, between, populations, of, colonial, latin, america, either, as, legal, counsel, or, an, advisor, a, directness, which, the, crown, would, need, to, attempt, to, create, the, centralized, colonial, state, which, it, wanted, to, implement, later, in, the, eighteenth, century, the, crown, sought, to, decrease, the, privileges, fueros, of, the, clergy, restricting, clerical, authority, to, spiritual, matters, and, undermining, the, power, of, parish, priests, who, often, acted, as, agents, of, the, crown, in, rural, parishes, by, desacralizing, power, and, frontal, attacks, on, the, clergy, the, crown, according, to, william, b, taylor, undermined, its, own, legitimacy, since, parish, priests, had, been, traditionally, the, natural, local, representatives, of, their, catholic, king, in, the, economic, sphere, the, crown, sought, to, gain, control, over, church, revenues, the, church, functioned, as, one, of, the, largest, economic, institutions, within, colonial, latin, america, it, owned, and, retained, jurisdiction, over, large, amounts, of, land, which, the, crown, wanted, for, itself, because, of, the, economic, value, which, could, be, derived, from, the, land, moreover, by, taking, that, land, for, itself, the, crown, had, the, opportunity, to, cut, down, the, physical, presence, of, the, church, to, further, weaken, its, ideological, and, social, role, within, local, colonial, communities, in, a, financial, crisis, of, 1804, the, crown, attempted, to, call, in, debts, owed, the, church, mainly, in, the, form, of, mortgages, for, haciendas, owned, by, the, elites, the, act, of, consolidation, simultaneously, threatened, the, wealth, of, the, church, whose, capital, was, mainly, lent, for, mortgages, as, well, as, threatening, the, financial, well, being, of, elites, who, depended, on, mortgages, for, acquiring, and, keeping, their, estates, shortening, the, repayment, period, meant, many, elites, were, faced, with, bankruptcy, the, crown, also, sought, to, gain, access, to, benefices, elite, families, set, aside, to, support, a, priest, often, their, own, family, members, by, eliminating, these, endowed, funds, capellan, as, that, the, lower, clergy, depended, on, disproportionately, prominently, in, mexico, lower, clergy, participated, in, the, insurgency, for, independence, with, priests, miguel, hidalgo, and, jos, mar, a, morelos, the, reforms, had, mixed, results, in, some, areas, such, as, cuba, r, o, de, la, plata, and, new, spain, the, reforms, had, positive, effects, improving, the, local, economy, and, the, efficiency, of, the, government, in, other, areas, the, changes, in, the, crown, s, economic, and, administrative, policies, led, to, tensions, with, locals, which, at, times, erupted, into, open, revolts, such, as, the, revolt, of, the, comuneros, in, new, granada, and, the, rebellion, of, t, pac, amaru, ii, in, peru, the, loss, of, high, offices, to, peninsulars, and, the, eighteenth, century, revolts, in, spanish, south, america, were, some, of, the, direct, causes, of, the, wars, of, independence, which, took, place, decades, later, but, they, have, been, considered, important, elements, of, the, political, background, in, which, the, wars, took, place, many, creoles, particularly, the, wealthy, creoles, were, negatively, impacted, by, the, bourbon, reforms, this, resulted, in, their, taking, action, by, using, their, wealth, and, positions, within, society, often, as, leaders, within, their, communities, to, spur, resistance, to, convey, their, displeasure, with, spanish, reforms, because, of, the, negative, economic, impact, which, they, had, however, because, of, how, quickly, their, revolts, would, further, radicalize, the, lower, classes, the, creoles, quickly, stopped, supporting, general, violent, insurrection, because, they, benefitted, from, social, change, that, occurred, through, the, systems, of, the, spanish, crown, institutional, change, ensured, stability, by, supporting, the, political, institutions, that, allowed, for, the, creation, of, a, wealthy, creole, class, and, further, adapting, those, institutions, to, meet, demands, rather, than, propose, a, radical, shift, in, the, complete, make, up, of, socioeconomic, life, and, traditions, however, institutional, change, did, not, come, as, anticipated, and, further, spurred, on, the, radicalization, of, spanish, american, social, classes, towards, independence, spain, s, international, wars, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, evidenced, the, empire, s, difficulties, in, reinforcing, its, colonial, possessions, and, provide, them, with, economic, aid, this, led, to, an, increased, local, participation, in, the, financing, of, the, defense, and, an, increased, participation, in, the, militias, by, the, chilean, born, such, development, was, at, odds, with, the, ideals, of, the, centralized, absolute, monarchy, the, spanish, did, also, formal, concessions, to, strengthen, the, defense, in, chilo, archipelago, spanish, authorities, promised, freedom, from, the, encomienda, those, indigenous, locals, who, settled, near, the, new, stronghold, of, ancud, founded, in, 1768, and, contributed, to, its, defense, the, increased, local, organization, of, the, defenses, would, ultimately, undermine, metropolitan, authority, and, bolster, the, independence, movement, other, factors, may, include, enlightenment, thinking, and, the, examples, of, the, atlantic, revolutions, the, enlightenment, spurred, the, desire, for, social, and, economic, reform, to, spread, throughout, spanish, america, and, the, iberian, peninsula, ideas, about, free, trade, and, physiocratic, economics, were, raised, by, the, enlightenment, in, spain, and, spread, to, the, overseas, empire, and, a, homegrown, spanish, american, enlightenment, the, political, reforms, implemented, and, the, many, constitutions, written, both, in, spain, and, throughout, the, spanish, world, during, the, wars, of, independence, were, influenced, by, these, factors, the, peninsular, war, was, the, trigger, for, conflicts, in, spanish, america, in, the, absence, of, a, legitimate, monarch, the, peninsular, war, began, an, extended, period, of, instability, in, the, worldwide, spanish, monarchy, that, lasted, until, 1823, napoleon, forced, the, bourbon, monarchs, to, abdicate, which, precipitated, a, political, crisis, in, spain, and, spanish, america, although, the, spanish, world, almost, uniformly, rejected, napoleon, s, plan, to, place, his, brother, joseph, on, the, throne, there, was, no, clear, solution, to, the, lack, of, a, king, following, traditional, spanish, political, theories, on, the, contractual, nature, of, the, monarchy, see, philosophy, of, law, of, francisco, su, rez, the, peninsular, provinces, responded, to, the, crisis, by, establishing, juntas, the, move, however, led, to, more, confusion, since, there, was, no, central, authority, and, most, juntas, did, not, recognize, the, claim, of, some, juntas, to, represent, the, monarchy, as, a, whole, the, junta, of, seville, in, particular, claimed, authority, over, the, overseas, empire, because, of, the, province, s, historic, role, as, the, exclusive, entrep, t, of, the, empire, this, impasse, was, resolved, through, negotiations, between, the, several, juntas, in, spain, counted, with, the, participation, of, the, council, of, castile, which, led, to, the, creation, of, a, main, government, the, supreme, central, and, governmental, junta, of, spain, and, the, indies, on, 25, september, 1808, it, was, agreed, that, the, kingdoms, of, the, peninsula, would, send, two, representatives, to, this, supreme, central, junta, and, that, the, overseas, kingdoms, would, send, one, representative, each, these, kingdoms, were, defined, as, the, viceroyalties, of, new, spain, mexico, peru, new, granada, and, buenos, aires, and, the, independent, captaincies, general, of, the, island, of, cuba, puerto, rico, guatemala, chile, province, of, venezuela, and, the, philippines, this, plan, was, criticized, for, providing, unequal, representation, to, spanish, america, nevertheless, throughout, the, end, of, 1808, and, early, 1809, the, regional, capitals, elected, candidates, whose, names, were, forwarded, to, the, capitals, of, the, viceroyalties, or, captaincies, general, several, important, and, large, cities, were, left, without, direct, representation, in, the, supreme, junta, in, particular, quito, and, chuquisaca, which, saw, themselves, as, the, capitals, of, kingdoms, resented, being, subsumed, in, the, larger, viceroyalty, of, peru, and, viceroyalty, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, respectively, this, unrest, led, to, the, establishment, of, juntas, in, these, cities, in, 1809, which, were, eventually, quashed, by, the, authorities, within, the, year, an, unsuccessful, attempt, at, establishing, a, junta, in, new, spain, was, also, stopped, the, escape, to, c, diz, and, the, dissolution, of, the, supreme, central, junta, on, 29, january, 1810, because, of, the, reverses, suffered, after, the, battle, of, oca, a, by, the, spanish, forces, paid, with, spanish, american, money, set, off, another, wave, of, juntas, being, established, in, the, americas, french, forces, had, taken, over, southern, spain, and, forced, the, supreme, junta, to, seek, refuge, in, the, island, city, of, c, diz, the, supreme, junta, replaced, itself, with, a, smaller, five, man, council, called, the, regency, or, the, council, of, regency, of, spain, and, the, indies, next, to, establish, a, more, legitimate, government, system, the, regency, called, for, the, convening, of, an, extraordinary, and, general, cortes, of, the, spanish, nation, which, was, convened, as, the, cortes, of, c, diz, the, plan, for, the, election, of, the, cortes, based, on, provinces, and, not, kingdoms, was, more, equitable, and, provided, more, time, to, determine, what, would, be, considered, an, overseas, province, the, cortes, of, c, diz, was, the, first, national, assembly, to, claim, sovereignty, in, spain, it, represented, the, abolition, of, the, old, kingdoms, the, opening, session, was, held, on, 24, september, 1810, in, the, building, now, known, as, the, real, teatro, de, las, cortes, under, the, siege, of, french, army, it, met, as, one, body, and, its, members, represented, the, entire, spanish, empire, most, spanish, americans, saw, no, reason, to, recognize, a, rump, government, that, was, under, the, threat, of, being, captured, by, the, french, at, any, moment, and, began, to, work, for, the, creation, of, local, juntas, to, preserve, the, region, s, independence, from, the, french, junta, movements, were, successful, in, new, granada, colombia, venezuela, chile, and, r, o, de, la, plata, argentina, less, successful, though, serious, movements, also, occurred, in, central, america, ultimately, central, america, along, with, most, of, new, spain, quito, ecuador, peru, upper, peru, bolivia, the, caribbean, and, the, philippine, islands, remained, under, control, of, royalists, for, the, next, decade, and, participated, in, the, cortes, of, c, diz, efforts, to, establish, a, liberal, government, for, the, spanish, monarchy, the, recruitment, of, soldiers, seemed, to, end, up, a, common, pool, employed, by, opposing, sides, as, cannon, fodder, socially, both, apparently, opposing, positions, loyalist, and, pro, independence, had, an, uncertain, significance, for, the, different, social, strata, of, the, monarchy, in, europe, the, spaniards, made, a, forced, recruitment, for, the, expeditionary, forces, leading, to, constant, rebellions, independent, states, relied, on, privateers, mercenaries, adventurers, or, filibusters, reliable, fighters, when, pay, or, booty, was, at, a, glance, for, the, mobilization, of, the, population, in, america, the, vast, majority, or, almost, all, of, the, troops, of, both, sides, the, indiscriminate, recruitment, of, native, american, communities, was, used, in, general, in, traditional, confronted, regions, social, improvements, were, promised, by, both, sides, to, the, indigenous, and, the, different, mestizo, colonial, castes, such, as, mulattoes, pardos, cholos, etc, and, even, african, slaves, were, recruited, by, both, sides, all, those, recruited, in, america, and, also, the, spaniards, joined, the, enemy, armies, as, combatants, when, they, were, captured, likewise, the, creole, potentates, of, european, origin, could, give, their, support, to, the, royalist, or, pro, independence, cause, in, relation, to, the, commercial, interests, of, each, region, the, church, was, also, divided, and, except, for, the, lower, clergy, involved, as, combatants, of, insurgency, their, position, was, in, accordance, with, the, political, power, the, creation, of, juntas, in, spanish, america, such, as, the, junta, suprema, de, caracas, on, 19, april, 1810, set, the, stage, for, the, fighting, that, would, afflict, the, region, for, the, next, decade, and, a, half, political, fault, lines, appeared, and, were, often, the, causes, of, military, conflict, on, the, one, hand, the, juntas, challenged, the, authority, of, all, royal, officials, whether, they, recognized, the, regency, or, not, on, the, other, hand, royal, officials, and, spanish, americans, who, desired, to, keep, the, empire, together, were, split, between, liberals, who, supported, the, efforts, of, the, cortes, and, conservatives, often, called, absolutists, in, the, historiography, who, did, not, want, to, see, any, innovations, in, government, finally, although, the, juntas, claimed, to, carry, out, their, actions, in, the, name, of, the, deposed, king, ferdinand, vii, their, creation, provided, an, opportunity, for, people, who, favored, outright, independence, to, promote, their, agenda, publicly, and, safely, the, proponents, of, independence, called, themselves, patriots, a, term, which, eventually, was, generally, applied, to, them, the, idea, that, independence, was, not, the, initial, concern, is, evidenced, by, the, fact, that, few, areas, declared, independence, in, the, years, after, 1810, the, congresses, of, venezuela, and, new, granada, did, so, in, 1811, and, also, paraguay, in, same, year, 14, and, 15, may, 1811, some, historians, explain, the, reluctance, to, declare, independence, as, a, mask, of, ferdinand, vii, that, is, that, patriot, leaders, felt, that, they, needed, to, claim, loyalty, to, the, deposed, monarch, to, prepare, the, masses, for, the, radical, change, that, full, independence, eventually, would, entail, nevertheless, even, areas, such, as, r, o, de, la, plata, and, chile, which, more, or, less, maintained, de, facto, independence, from, the, peninsular, authorities, did, not, declare, independence, until, quite, a, few, years, later, in, 1816, and, 1818, respectively, overall, despite, achieving, formal, or, de, facto, independence, many, regions, of, spanish, america, were, marked, by, nearly, continuous, wars, which, lasted, well, into, the, 1820s, in, mexico, where, the, junta, movement, had, been, stopped, in, its, early, stages, by, a, coalition, of, peninsular, merchants, and, government, officials, efforts, to, establish, a, government, independent, of, the, regency, or, the, french, took, the, form, of, rebellion, under, the, leadership, of, miguel, hidalgo, hidalgo, was, captured, and, executed, in, 1811, but, a, resistance, movement, continued, which, declared, independence, from, spain, in, 1813, the, guti, rrez, magee, expedition, was, a, joint, tejanos, us, volunteers, expedition, formed, in, louisiana, for, texas, independence, but, was, defeated, in, the, battle, of, medina, in, central, america, attempts, at, establishing, juntas, were, also, put, down, but, resulted, in, significantly, less, violence, the, caribbean, islands, like, the, philippines, on, the, other, side, of, the, world, were, relatively, peaceful, any, plots, to, set, up, juntas, were, denounced, to, the, authorities, early, enough, to, stop, them, before, they, gained, widespread, support, major, cities, and, regional, rivalry, played, an, important, role, in, the, wars, the, disappearance, of, a, central, imperial, authority, and, in, some, cases, of, even, a, local, viceregal, authority, as, in, the, cases, of, new, granada, and, r, o, de, la, plata, initiated, a, prolonged, period, of, balkanization, in, many, regions, of, spanish, america, it, was, not, clear, which, political, units, should, replace, the, empire, and, there, were, no, new, national, identities, to, replace, the, traditional, sense, of, being, spaniards, the, original, juntas, of, 1810, appealed, first, to, a, sense, of, being, spanish, which, was, counterposed, to, the, french, threat, second, to, a, general, american, identity, which, was, counterposed, to, the, peninsula, lost, to, the, french, and, third, to, a, sense, of, belonging, to, the, major, cities, or, local, province, the, patria, in, spanish, more, often, than, not, juntas, sought, to, maintain, a, province, s, independence, from, the, capital, of, the, former, viceroyalty, or, captaincy, general, as, much, as, from, the, peninsula, itself, armed, conflicts, broke, out, between, the, provinces, over, the, question, of, whether, some, cities, or, provinces, were, to, be, subordinate, to, others, as, they, had, been, under, the, crown, this, phenomenon, was, particularly, evident, in, south, america, this, rivalry, also, led, some, regions, to, adopt, the, opposite, political, cause, to, that, chosen, by, their, rivals, peru, seems, to, have, remained, strongly, royalist, in, large, part, because, of, its, rivalry, with, r, o, de, la, plata, to, which, it, had, lost, control, of, upper, peru, when, the, latter, was, elevated, to, a, viceroyalty, in, 1776, the, creation, of, juntas, in, r, o, de, la, plata, allowed, peru, to, regain, formal, control, of, upper, peru, for, the, duration, of, the, wars, underlying, social, and, racial, tensions, also, had, a, great, impact, on, the, nature, of, the, fighting, rural, areas, were, pitted, against, urban, centers, as, grievances, against, the, authorities, found, an, outlet, in, the, political, conflict, this, was, the, case, with, hidalgo, s, peasant, revolt, which, was, fueled, as, much, by, discontent, over, several, years, of, bad, harvests, as, with, events, in, the, peninsular, war, hidalgo, was, originally, part, of, a, circle, of, liberal, urbanites, in, quer, taro, who, sought, to, establish, a, junta, after, this, conspiracy, was, discovered, hidalgo, turned, to, the, rural, people, of, the, mexican, baj, o, to, build, his, army, and, their, interests, soon, overshadowed, those, of, the, urban, intellectuals, a, similar, tension, existed, in, venezuela, where, the, spanish, immigrant, jos, tom, s, boves, formed, a, powerful, though, irregular, royalist, army, out, of, the, llaneros, mixed, race, slave, and, plains, people, by, attacking, the, white, landowning, class, boves, and, his, followers, often, disregarded, the, command, of, spanish, officials, and, were, not, concerned, with, actually, re, establishing, the, toppled, royal, government, choosing, instead, to, keep, real, power, among, themselves, finally, in, the, back, country, of, upper, peru, the, republiquetas, kept, the, idea, of, independence, alive, by, allying, with, disenfranchised, members, of, rural, society, and, native, groups, but, were, never, able, to, take, the, major, population, centers, increasingly, violent, confrontations, developed, between, spaniards, and, spanish, americans, but, this, tension, was, often, related, to, class, issues, or, fomented, by, patriot, leaders, to, create, a, new, sense, of, nationalism, after, being, incited, to, rid, the, country, of, the, gachupines, a, disparaging, term, for, peninsulares, hidalgo, s, forces, indiscriminately, massacred, hundreds, of, criollos, and, peninsulares, who, had, taken, refuge, at, the, alh, ndiga, de, granaditas, in, guanajuato, in, venezuela, during, his, admirable, campaign, sim, n, bol, var, instituted, a, policy, of, a, war, to, the, death, in, which, royalist, spanish, americans, would, be, purposely, spared, but, even, neutral, peninsulares, would, be, killed, to, drive, a, wedge, between, the, two, groups, this, policy, laid, the, ground, for, the, violent, royalist, reaction, under, boves, often, though, royalism, or, patriotism, simply, provided, a, banner, to, organize, the, aggrieved, and, the, political, causes, could, be, discarded, just, as, quickly, as, they, were, picked, up, the, venezuelan, llaneros, switched, to, the, patriot, banner, once, the, elites, and, the, urban, centers, became, securely, royalist, after, 1815, and, it, was, the, royal, army, in, mexico, that, ultimately, brought, about, that, nation, s, independence, philosophers, works, at, the, first, years, of, war, during, spanish, constitutional, period, the, main, military, effort, of, spain, was, aimed, at, preserving, the, island, of, cuba, and, the, viceroyalty, of, mexico, in, north, america, but, in, 1814, with, the, restoration, of, ferdinand, vii, the, strategic, line, of, the, war, changed, drastically, directing, the, major, spanish, military, effort, towards, south, america, by, 1815, the, general, outlines, of, which, areas, were, controlled, by, royalists, and, pro, independence, forces, were, established, and, a, general, stalemate, set, in, the, war, in, areas, where, royalists, controlled, the, main, population, centers, most, of, the, fighting, by, those, seeking, independence, was, done, by, isolated, guerrilla, bands, in, new, spain, the, two, main, guerrilla, groups, were, led, by, guadalupe, victoria, in, puebla, and, vicente, guerrero, in, oaxaca, in, northern, south, america, new, granadan, and, venezuelan, patriots, under, leaders, such, as, sim, n, bol, var, francisco, de, paula, santander, santiago, mari, o, manuel, piar, and, jos, antonio, p, ez, carried, out, campaigns, in, the, vast, orinoco, river, basin, and, along, the, caribbean, coast, often, with, material, aid, coming, from, cura, ao, and, haiti, also, as, mentioned, above, in, upper, peru, guerrilla, bands, controlled, the, isolated, rural, parts, of, the, country, in, march, 1814, following, the, collapse, of, the, first, french, empire, ferdinand, vii, was, restored, to, the, spanish, throne, this, signified, an, important, change, since, most, of, the, political, and, legal, changes, made, on, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, the, myriad, of, juntas, the, cortes, in, spain, and, several, of, the, congresses, in, the, americas, and, many, of, the, constitutions, and, new, legal, codes, had, been, made, in, his, name, before, entering, spanish, territory, ferdinand, made, loose, promises, to, the, cortes, that, he, would, uphold, the, spanish, constitution, but, once, in, spain, he, realized, that, he, had, significant, support, from, conservatives, in, the, general, population, and, the, hierarchy, of, the, spanish, catholic, church, so, on, 4, may, he, repudiated, the, constitution, and, ordered, the, arrest, of, liberal, leaders, on, 10, may, ferdinand, justified, his, actions, by, stating, that, the, constitution, and, other, changes, had, been, made, by, a, cortes, assembled, in, his, absence, and, without, his, consent, he, restored, the, former, legal, codes, and, political, institutions, and, promised, to, convene, a, new, cortes, under, its, traditional, form, with, separate, chambers, for, the, clergy, and, the, nobility, a, promise, never, fulfilled, news, of, the, events, arrived, through, spanish, america, during, the, next, three, weeks, to, nine, months, depending, on, time, it, took, goods, and, people, to, travel, from, spain, ferdinand, s, actions, constituted, a, definitive, de, facto, break, both, with, the, autonomous, governments, which, had, not, yet, declared, formal, independence, and, with, the, effort, of, spanish, liberals, to, create, a, representative, government, that, would, fully, include, the, overseas, possessions, such, a, government, was, seen, as, an, alternative, to, independence, by, many, in, new, spain, central, america, the, caribbean, quito, peru, upper, peru, and, chile, yet, the, news, of, the, restoration, of, the, ancien, r, gime, did, not, initiate, a, new, wave, of, juntas, as, had, happened, in, 1809, and, 1810, with, the, notable, exception, of, the, establishment, of, a, junta, in, cuzco, demanding, the, implementation, of, the, spanish, constitution, instead, most, spanish, americans, were, moderates, who, decided, to, wait, and, see, what, would, come, out, of, the, restoration, of, normalcy, in, fact, in, areas, of, new, spain, central, america, and, quito, governors, found, it, expedient, to, leave, the, elected, constitutional, ayuntamientos, in, place, for, several, years, to, prevent, conflict, with, the, local, society, liberals, on, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, nevertheless, continued, to, conspire, to, bring, back, a, constitutional, monarchy, ultimately, succeeding, in, 1820, the, most, dramatic, example, of, transatlantic, collaboration, is, perhaps, francisco, javier, mina, s, expedition, to, texas, and, northern, mexico, in, 1816, and, 1817, spanish, americans, in, royalist, areas, who, were, committed, to, independence, had, already, joined, the, guerrilla, movements, however, ferdinand, s, actions, did, set, areas, outside, of, the, control, of, the, crown, on, the, path, to, full, independence, the, governments, of, these, regions, which, had, their, origins, in, the, juntas, of, 1810, and, even, moderates, there, who, had, entertained, a, reconciliation, with, the, crown, now, saw, the, need, to, separate, from, spain, if, they, were, to, protect, the, reforms, they, had, enacted, during, this, period, royalist, forces, made, advances, into, new, granada, which, they, controlled, from, 1815, to, 1819, and, into, chile, which, they, controlled, from, 1814, to, 1817, except, for, royalist, areas, in, the, northeast, and, south, the, provinces, of, new, granada, had, maintained, independence, from, spain, since, 1810, unlike, neighboring, venezuela, where, royalists, and, pro, independence, forces, had, exchanged, control, of, the, region, several, times, to, pacify, venezuela, and, to, retake, new, granada, spain, organized, in, 1815, the, largest, armed, force, it, ever, sent, to, the, new, world, consisting, of, 10, 500, troops, and, nearly, sixty, ships, although, this, force, was, crucial, in, retaking, a, solidly, pro, independence, region, like, new, granada, see, spanish, reconquest, of, new, granada, its, soldiers, were, eventually, spread, out, throughout, venezuela, new, granada, quito, and, peru, and, were, lost, to, tropical, diseases, diluting, their, impact, on, the, war, more, importantly, the, majority, of, the, royalist, forces, were, composed, not, of, soldiers, sent, from, the, peninsula, but, of, spanish, americans, overall, europeans, formed, only, about, a, tenth, of, the, royalist, armies, in, spanish, america, and, only, about, half, of, the, expeditionary, units, once, they, were, deployed, in, the, americas, since, each, european, soldier, casualty, was, replaced, by, a, spanish, american, soldier, over, time, there, were, more, and, more, spanish, american, soldiers, in, the, expeditionary, units, for, example, pablo, morillo, commander, in, chief, of, the, expeditionary, force, sent, to, south, america, reported, that, he, had, only, 2, 000, european, soldiers, under, his, command, in, 1820, in, other, words, only, half, the, soldiers, of, his, expeditionary, force, were, european, it, is, estimated, that, in, the, battle, of, maip, only, a, quarter, of, the, royalist, forces, were, european, soldiers, in, the, battle, of, carabobo, about, a, fifth, and, in, the, battle, of, ayacucho, less, than, 1, was, european, the, american, militias, reflected, the, racial, make, up, of, the, local, population, for, example, in, 1820, the, royalist, army, in, venezuela, had, 843, white, espa, ol, 5, 378, casta, and, 980, indigenous, soldiers, towards, the, end, of, this, period, the, pro, independence, forces, made, two, important, advances, in, the, southern, cone, a, veteran, of, the, spanish, army, with, experience, in, the, peninsular, war, jos, de, san, mart, n, became, the, governor, of, the, province, of, cuyo, he, used, this, position, to, begin, organizing, an, army, as, early, as, 1814, in, preparation, for, an, invasion, of, chile, this, was, an, important, change, in, strategy, after, three, united, provinces, campaigns, had, been, defeated, in, upper, peru, san, mart, n, s, army, became, the, nucleus, of, the, army, of, the, andes, which, received, crucial, political, and, material, support, in, 1816, when, juan, mart, n, de, pueyrred, n, became, supreme, director, of, the, united, provinces, in, january, 1817, san, mart, n, was, finally, ready, to, advance, against, the, royalists, in, chile, ignoring, an, injunction, from, the, congress, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, not, to, move, against, chile, san, mart, n, together, with, general, bernardo, o, higgins, riquelme, later, supreme, director, of, chile, led, the, army, over, the, andes, in, a, move, that, turned, the, tables, on, the, royalists, by, 10, february, san, mart, n, had, control, of, northern, and, central, chile, and, a, year, later, after, a, war, with, no, quarter, the, south, with, the, aid, of, a, fleet, under, the, command, of, former, british, naval, officer, thomas, cochrane, chile, was, secured, from, royalist, control, and, independence, was, declared, that, year, san, mart, n, and, his, allies, spent, the, next, two, years, planning, an, invasion, of, peru, which, began, in, 1820, in, northern, south, america, after, several, failed, campaigns, to, take, caracas, and, other, urban, centers, of, venezuela, sim, n, bol, var, devised, a, similar, plan, in, 1819, to, cross, the, andes, and, liberate, new, granada, from, the, royalists, like, san, mart, n, bol, var, personally, undertook, the, efforts, to, create, an, army, to, invade, a, neighboring, country, collaborated, with, pro, independence, exiles, from, that, region, and, lacked, the, approval, of, the, venezuelan, congress, unlike, san, mart, n, however, bol, var, did, not, have, a, professionally, trained, army, but, rather, a, quickly, assembled, mix, of, llanero, guerrillas, new, granadan, exiles, led, by, santander, and, british, recruits, from, june, to, july, 1819, using, the, rainy, season, as, cover, bol, var, led, his, army, across, the, flooded, plains, and, over, the, cold, forbidding, passes, of, the, andes, with, heavy, losses, a, quarter, of, the, british, legion, perished, as, well, as, many, of, his, llanero, soldiers, who, were, not, prepared, for, the, nearly, 4, 000, meter, altitudes, but, the, gamble, paid, off, by, august, bol, var, was, in, control, of, bogot, and, its, treasury, and, gained, the, support, of, many, in, new, granada, which, still, resented, the, harsh, reconquest, carried, out, under, morillo, nevertheless, santander, found, it, necessary, to, continue, the, policy, of, the, war, to, the, death, and, carried, out, the, execution, of, thirty, eight, royalist, officers, who, had, surrendered, with, the, resources, of, new, granada, bol, var, became, the, undisputed, leader, of, the, patriots, in, venezuela, and, orchestrated, the, union, of, the, two, regions, in, a, new, state, called, colombia, gran, colombia, to, counter, the, advances, the, pro, independence, forces, had, made, in, south, america, spain, prepared, a, second, large, expeditionary, force, in, 1819, this, force, however, never, left, spain, instead, it, became, the, means, by, which, liberals, were, finally, able, to, reinstate, a, constitutional, regime, on, 1, january, 1820, rafael, riego, commander, of, the, asturias, battalion, headed, a, rebellion, among, the, troops, demanding, the, return, of, the, 1812, constitution, his, troops, marched, through, the, cities, of, andalusia, with, the, hope, of, extending, the, uprising, to, the, civilian, population, but, locals, were, mostly, indifferent, an, uprising, however, did, occur, in, galicia, in, northern, spain, and, from, there, it, quickly, spread, throughout, the, country, on, 7, march, the, royal, palace, in, madrid, was, surrounded, by, soldiers, under, the, command, of, general, francisco, ballesteros, and, three, days, later, on, 10, march, the, besieged, ferdinand, vii, now, a, virtual, prisoner, agreed, to, restore, the, constitution, riego, s, revolt, had, two, significant, effects, on, the, war, in, the, americas, militarily, the, large, numbers, of, reinforcements, which, were, especially, needed, to, retake, new, granada, and, defend, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, would, never, arrive, furthermore, as, the, royalists, situation, became, more, desperate, in, region, after, region, the, army, experienced, wholesale, defections, of, units, to, the, patriot, side, politically, the, reinstitution, of, a, liberal, regime, changed, the, terms, under, which, the, spanish, government, sought, to, engage, the, insurgents, the, new, government, naively, assumed, that, the, insurgents, were, fighting, for, spanish, liberalism, and, that, the, spanish, constitution, could, still, be, the, basis, of, reconciliation, between, the, two, sides, the, government, implemented, the, constitution, and, held, elections, in, the, overseas, provinces, just, as, in, spain, it, also, ordered, military, commanders, to, begin, armistice, negotiations, with, the, insurgents, with, the, promise, that, they, could, participate, in, the, restored, representative, government, in, effect, the, spanish, constitution, of, 1812, adopted, by, the, cortes, of, c, diz, served, as, the, basis, for, independence, in, new, spain, and, central, america, since, in, both, regions, it, was, a, coalition, of, conservative, and, liberal, royalist, leaders, who, led, the, establishment, of, new, states, the, spanish, constitution, of, 1812, attempted, to, return, to, the, policies, that, the, spanish, government, had, implemented, under, habsburg, rule, these, policies, gave, recognized, spanish, colonial, territory, as, fellow, kingdoms, with, equal, standing, to, spain, the, policies, under, the, habsburgs, moreover, allowed, for, constant, revisionism, through, corruption, and, the, sale, of, office, that, provided, the, opportunity, to, grant, more, rights, and, change, policy, to, respond, to, the, demands, of, the, populations, the, restoration, of, the, spanish, constitution, and, representative, government, was, enthusiastically, welcomed, in, new, spain, and, central, america, elections, were, held, local, governments, formed, and, deputies, sent, to, the, cortes, the, spanish, constitution, of, 1812, could, have, been, an, opportunity, to, enact, social, change, slowly, and, without, the, threat, of, a, radicalized, uprising, from, the, lower, social, classes, by, offering, an, opportunity, to, enact, change, that, those, in, power, would, believe, would, best, benefit, their, respective, territories, among, liberals, however, there, was, fear, that, the, new, regime, would, not, last, and, conservatives, and, the, church, worried, that, the, new, liberal, government, would, expand, its, reforms, and, anti, clerical, legislation, yet, because, the, cortes, of, c, diz, was, located, in, spain, political, and, economic, power, and, decisions, were, localized, in, spain, effectively, giving, them, control, over, all, of, colonial, latin, america, these, tensions, further, frustrated, many, spanish, americans, because, of, their, inability, to, control, the, politics, that, directly, affected, their, economic, and, sociopolitical, wellbeing, further, leading, them, towards, independence, this, climate, of, instability, created, the, conditions, for, the, two, sides, to, forge, an, alliance, this, alliance, coalesced, towards, the, end, of, 1820, behind, agust, n, de, iturbide, a, colonel, in, the, royal, army, who, at, the, time, was, assigned, to, destroy, the, guerrilla, forces, led, by, vicente, guerrero, in, january, 1821, in, expectation, of, the, abolition, in, spain, of, the, constitution, of, 1812, iturbide, was, chosen, and, was, sent, by, the, officials, of, new, spain, with, guerrero, the, leader, of, the, rebellions, he, began, so, called, peace, negotiations, suggesting, the, parties, unite, to, establish, an, independent, new, spain, later, iturbide, was, dethroned, and, quietly, captured, to, be, executed, the, simple, terms, that, iturbide, proposed, became, the, basis, of, the, plan, of, iguala, the, independence, of, new, spain, now, to, be, called, the, mexican, empire, with, ferdinand, vii, or, another, bourbon, as, emperor, the, retention, of, the, catholic, church, as, the, official, state, religion, and, the, protection, of, its, existing, privileges, and, the, equality, of, all, new, spaniards, whether, immigrants, or, native, born, many, of, that, laws, was, abolished, decades, later, or, are, in, present, day, mexico, the, following, month, the, other, important, guerrilla, leader, guadalupe, victoria, joined, the, alliance, and, on, 1, march, iturbide, was, proclaimed, head, of, a, new, army, of, the, three, guarantees, the, representative, of, the, new, spanish, government, superior, political, chief, juan, o, donoj, who, replaced, the, previous, viceroys, arrived, in, veracruz, on, 1, july, 1821, but, he, found, that, royalists, held, the, entire, country, except, for, veracruz, mexico, city, and, acapulco, since, at, the, time, that, o, donoj, had, left, spain, the, cortes, was, considering, greatly, expanding, the, autonomy, of, the, overseas, spanish, possessions, o, donoj, proposed, to, negotiate, a, treaty, with, iturbide, on, the, terms, of, the, plan, of, iguala, the, resulting, treaty, of, c, rdoba, which, was, signed, on, 24, august, kept, all, existing, laws, including, the, 1812, constitution, in, force, until, a, new, constitution, for, mexico, could, be, written, o, donoj, became, part, of, the, provisional, governing, junta, until, his, death, on, 8, october, both, the, spanish, cortes, and, ferdinand, vii, rejected, the, treaty, of, c, rdoba, and, the, final, break, with, the, mother, country, came, on, 19, may, 1822, when, the, mexican, congress, conferred, the, throne, on, iturbide, spain, recognized, mexico, s, independence, in, 1836, central, america, gained, its, independence, along, with, new, spain, on, 15, september, 1821, an, act, of, independence, was, signed, in, guatemala, city, which, declared, central, america, guatemala, honduras, el, salvador, nicaragua, and, costa, rica, independent, from, spain, the, regional, elites, supported, the, terms, of, the, plan, of, iguala, and, orchestrated, the, union, of, central, america, with, the, mexican, empire, in, january, 1822, one, years, later, following, iturbide, s, downfall, the, region, with, the, exception, of, chiapas, peacefully, seceded, from, mexico, on, 1, july, 1823, establishing, the, federal, republic, of, central, america, the, new, state, existed, for, seventeen, years, centrifugal, forces, pulling, the, individual, provinces, apart, by, 1840, unlike, in, new, spain, and, central, america, in, south, america, independence, was, spurred, by, the, pro, independence, fighters, who, had, held, out, for, the, past, half, decade, jos, de, san, mart, n, and, sim, n, bol, var, inadvertently, led, a, continent, wide, pincer, movement, from, southern, and, northern, south, america, that, liberated, most, of, the, spanish, american, nations, on, that, continent, after, securing, the, independence, of, chile, in, 1818, san, mart, n, concentrated, on, building, a, naval, fleet, in, the, pacific, to, counter, spanish, control, of, those, waters, and, reach, the, royalist, stronghold, of, lima, by, mid, 1820, san, mart, n, had, assembled, a, fleet, of, eight, warships, and, sixteen, transport, ships, under, the, command, of, admiral, cochrane, the, fleet, set, sail, from, valpara, so, to, paracas, in, southern, peru, on, 7, september, the, army, landed, at, paracas, and, successfully, took, pisco, after, this, san, mart, n, waiting, for, a, generalized, peruvian, revolt, chose, to, avoid, direct, military, confrontation, san, mart, n, hoped, that, his, presence, would, initiate, an, authentic, peruvian, revolt, against, spanish, rule, believing, that, otherwise, any, liberation, would, be, ephemeral, in, the, meantime, san, mart, n, engaged, in, diplomacy, with, viceroy, joaqu, n, de, la, pezuela, who, was, under, orders, from, the, constitutional, government, to, negotiate, on, the, basis, of, the, 1812, constitution, and, to, maintain, the, unity, of, the, spanish, monarchy, however, these, efforts, proved, fruitless, since, independence, and, unity, of, the, monarchy, could, not, be, reconciled, so, the, army, sailed, in, late, october, to, a, better, strategic, position, in, huacho, in, northern, peru, during, the, next, few, months, successful, land, and, naval, campaigns, against, the, royalists, secured, the, new, foothold, and, it, was, at, huacho, that, san, mart, n, learned, that, guayaquil, in, ecuador, had, declared, independence, on, 9, october, bol, var, learning, about, the, collapse, of, the, c, diz, expedition, spent, the, year, 1820, preparing, a, liberating, campaign, in, venezuela, bol, var, was, aided, by, spain, s, new, policy, of, seeking, engagement, with, the, insurgents, which, morillo, implemented, renouncing, to, the, command, in, chief, and, returning, to, spain, although, bol, var, rejected, the, spanish, proposal, that, the, patriots, rejoin, spain, under, the, spanish, constitution, the, two, sides, established, a, six, month, truce, and, the, regularization, of, the, rules, of, engagement, under, the, law, of, nations, on, 25, and, 26, november, the, truce, did, not, last, six, months, it, was, apparent, to, all, that, the, royalist, cause, had, been, greatly, weakened, by, the, lack, of, reinforcements, royalist, soldiers, and, whole, units, began, to, desert, or, defect, to, the, patriots, in, large, numbers, on, 28, january, 1821, the, ayuntamiento, of, maracaibo, declared, the, province, an, independent, republic, that, chose, to, join, the, new, nation, state, of, gran, colombia, miguel, de, la, torre, who, had, replaced, morillo, as, head, of, the, army, took, this, to, be, a, violation, of, the, truce, and, although, the, republicans, argued, that, maracaibo, had, switched, sides, of, its, own, volition, both, sides, began, to, prepare, for, renewed, war, the, fate, of, venezuela, was, sealed, when, bol, var, returned, there, in, april, leading, an, army, of, 7, 000, from, new, granada, at, the, battle, of, carabobo, on, 24, june, the, gran, colombian, forces, decisively, defeated, the, royalist, forces, assuring, control, of, venezuela, save, for, puerto, cabello, and, guaranteeing, venezuelan, independence, bol, var, could, now, concentrate, on, gran, colombia, s, claims, to, southern, new, granada, and, quito, in, peru, on, 29, january, 1821, viceroy, pezuela, was, deposed, in, a, coup, d, tat, by, jos, de, la, serna, but, it, would, be, two, months, before, san, mart, n, moved, his, army, closer, to, lima, by, sailing, it, to, anc, n, during, the, next, few, months, san, mart, n, once, again, engaged, in, negotiations, offering, the, creation, of, an, independent, monarchy, but, la, serna, insisted, on, the, unity, of, the, spanish, monarchy, so, the, negotiations, came, to, nothing, by, july, la, serna, judged, his, hold, on, lima, to, be, weak, and, on, 8, july, the, royal, army, abandoned, the, coastal, city, to, reinforce, positions, in, the, highlands, with, cuzco, as, new, capital, of, the, viceroyalty, on, the, 12th, san, mart, n, entered, lima, where, he, was, declared, protector, of, the, country, on, 28, july, an, office, which, allowed, him, to, rule, the, newly, independent, state, to, ensure, that, the, presidency, of, quito, became, a, part, of, gran, colombia, and, did, not, remain, a, collection, of, small, divided, republics, bol, var, sent, aid, in, the, form, of, supplies, and, an, army, under, antonio, jos, de, sucre, to, guayaquil, in, february, 1821, for, a, year, sucre, was, unable, to, take, quito, and, by, november, both, sides, exhausted, signed, a, ninety, day, armistice, the, following, year, at, the, battle, of, pichincha, on, 24, may, 1822, sucre, s, venezuelan, forces, finally, conquered, quito, gran, colombia, s, hold, on, the, territory, was, secure, the, following, year, after, a, peruvian, patriot, army, was, destroyed, in, the, battle, of, ica, san, mart, n, met, with, sim, n, bol, var, in, guayaquil, on, 26, and, 27, july, thereafter, san, mart, n, decided, to, retire, from, the, scene, for, the, next, two, years, two, armies, of, rioplatense, argentinian, chilean, colombian, and, peruvian, patriots, were, destroyed, trying, to, penetrate, the, royalist, bastion, in, the, andean, regions, of, peru, and, upper, peru, a, year, later, a, peruvian, congress, resolved, to, make, bol, var, head, of, the, patriot, forces, in, the, country, an, internecine, conflict, between, la, serna, and, general, pedro, antonio, ola, eta, which, was, an, extension, of, the, liberal, triennium, proved, to, be, the, royalists, undoing, la, serna, lost, control, of, half, of, his, best, army, by, the, beginning, of, 1824, giving, the, patriots, an, opportunity, under, the, command, of, bol, var, and, sucre, the, experienced, veterans, of, the, combined, army, mainly, colombians, destroyed, a, royalist, army, under, la, serna, s, command, in, the, battle, of, ayacucho, on, 9, december, 1824, la, serna, s, army, was, numerically, superior, but, consisted, of, mostly, new, recruits, the, only, significant, royalist, area, remaining, on, the, continent, was, the, highland, country, of, upper, peru, following, the, battle, of, ayacucho, the, royalist, troops, of, upper, peru, under, the, command, of, ola, eta, surrendered, after, he, died, in, tumusla, on, 2, april, 1825, bol, var, tended, to, favor, maintaining, the, unity, of, upper, peru, with, peru, but, the, upper, peruvian, leaders, many, former, royalists, like, casimiro, ola, eta, nephew, of, general, ola, eta, gathered, in, a, congress, under, sucre, s, auspices, supported, the, country, s, independence, bol, var, left, the, decision, to, sucre, who, went, along, with, the, congress, sucre, proclaimed, upper, peru, s, independence, in, the, city, which, now, bears, his, name, on, 6, august, bringing, the, main, wars, of, independence, to, an, end, as, it, became, clear, that, there, was, to, be, no, reversal, of, spanish, american, independence, several, of, the, new, states, began, to, receive, international, recognition, early, in, 1822, the, united, states, recognized, chile, the, united, provinces, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, peru, gran, colombia, and, mexico, britain, waited, until, 1825, after, the, battle, of, ayacucho, to, recognize, mexico, gran, colombia, and, r, o, de, la, plata, both, nations, recognized, more, spanish, american, states, in, the, next, few, years, the, spanish, coastal, fortifications, in, veracruz, callao, and, chilo, were, the, footholds, that, resisted, until, 1825, and, 1826, respectively, in, the, following, decade, royalist, guerrillas, continued, to, operate, in, several, countries, and, spain, launched, a, few, attempts, to, retake, parts, of, the, spanish, american, mainland, in, 1827, colonel, jos, arizabalo, started, an, irregular, war, with, venezuelan, guerrillas, and, brigadier, isidro, barradas, led, the, last, attempt, with, regular, troops, to, reconquer, mexico, in, 1829, the, pincheira, brothers, moved, to, patagonia, and, remained, there, as, multiethnic, royalist, outlaws, gang, until, defeated, in, 1832, but, efforts, like, these, did, not, reverse, the, new, political, situation, the, increasing, irrelevance, of, the, holy, alliance, after, 1825, and, the, fall, of, the, bourbon, dynasty, in, france, in, 1830, during, the, july, revolution, eliminated, the, principal, support, of, ferdinand, vii, in, europe, but, it, was, not, until, the, king, s, death, in, 1833, that, spain, finally, abandoned, all, plans, of, military, reconquest, and, in, 1836, its, government, went, so, far, as, to, renounce, sovereignty, over, all, of, continental, america, during, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, spain, would, recognize, each, of, the, new, states, only, cuba, puerto, rico, the, spanish, virgin, islands, and, briefly, santo, domingo, remained, under, spanish, rule, until, the, spanish, american, war, in, 1898, the, nearly, decade, and, a, half, of, wars, greatly, weakened, the, spanish, american, economies, and, political, institutions, which, hindered, the, region, s, potential, economic, development, for, most, of, the, nineteenth, century, and, resulted, in, the, enduring, instability, the, region, experienced, independence, destroyed, the, de, facto, trade, bloc, that, was, the, spanish, empire, manila, galleons, and, spanish, treasure, fleets, in, particular, after, independence, trade, among, the, new, spanish, american, nations, was, less, than, it, had, been, in, the, colonial, period, once, the, ties, were, broken, the, small, populations, of, most, of, the, new, nations, provided, little, incentive, to, entice, spanish, american, producers, to, recreate, the, old, trade, patterns, in, addition, the, protection, against, european, competition, which, the, spanish, monopoly, had, provided, to, the, manufacturing, sectors, of, the, economy, ended, due, to, expediency, protective, tariffs, for, these, sectors, in, particular, textile, production, were, permanently, dropped, and, foreign, imports, beat, out, local, production, this, greatly, affected, native, communities, which, in, many, parts, of, spanish, america, specialized, in, supplying, finished, products, to, the, urban, markets, albeit, using, pre, industrial, quarters, in, mexico, cities, dependent, on, seaborne, trade, like, valdivia, plunged, into, depression, as, the, intracolonial, trade, system, collapsed, foreign, trade, policies, varied, among, the, new, countries, some, like, the, united, provinces, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, and, peru, applied, initially, protectionist, policies, while, chile, was, more, open, to, foreign, trade, while, still, applying, a, kind, of, neomercantilism, the, new, states, that, began, to, take, root, in, latin, america, particularly, mexico, often, courted, foreign, financial, support, from, european, nations, this, foreign, investment, often, came, via, loans, which, only, continued, to, cripple, economies, that, had, been, destroyed, or, left, alone, during, conflict, this, investment, was, not, enough, to, support, economic, recovery, and, can, be, considered, to, have, only, further, negatively, impacted, economic, growth, in, these, newly, developing, states, by, pushing, them, further, into, debt, in, an, attempt, to, recover, and, grow, their, economies, as, the, newly, independent, nations, finally, entered, the, world, economy, after, the, end, of, the, french, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, wars, when, the, economies, of, europe, and, the, united, states, were, recovering, and, aggressively, seeking, new, markets, to, sell, their, products, after, more, than, two, decades, of, disruption, ultimately, spanish, america, could, only, connect, to, the, world, markets, as, an, exporter, of, raw, materials, and, a, consumer, of, finished, products, independence, from, the, spanish, crown, required, solidarity, across, all, social, classes, however, each, social, faction, had, their, ideas, of, what, local, society, should, and, would, look, like, after, independence, this, impacted, the, ability, for, societies, to, easily, integrate, because, of, the, disunity, of, their, ideas, of, future, political, systems, and, ideologies, which, resulted, in, more, conflict, when, it, came, to, state, consolidation, the, power, which, the, elite, creole, class, commanded, allowed, them, to, control, state, and, national, development, to, ensure, that, they, remained, in, power, as, a, result, the, newly, forming, latin, american, states, would, fulfill, some, of, the, demands, of, other, social, factions, to, ensure, the, stability, and, integration, of, all, into, the, social, fabric, of, a, new, state, while, guaranteeing, the, continual, reproduction, of, the, creole, elite, into, position, of, power, and, control, over, the, rest, of, society, the, political, debate, seeking, answers, to, these, questions, was, marked, by, a, clash, between, liberalism, and, conservatism, conservatives, sought, to, maintain, the, traditional, social, structures, to, ensure, stability, liberals, sought, to, create, a, more, dynamic, society, and, economy, by, ending, ethnically, based, social, distinctions, and, freeing, property, from, economic, restrictions, in, its, quest, to, transform, society, liberals, often, adopted, policies, that, were, not, welcomed, by, native, communities, who, had, benefited, from, unique, protections, afforded, to, them, by, traditional, spanish, law, independence, however, did, initiate, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, spanish, america, as, it, was, seen, as, part, of, the, independence, struggle, since, many, slaves, had, gained, their, manumission, by, joining, the, patriot, armies, in, areas, where, slavery, was, not, a, major, source, of, labor, mexico, central, america, chile, emancipation, occurred, almost, immediately, after, independence, was, achieved, in, areas, where, slavery, was, a, main, labor, source, colombia, venezuela, peru, argentina, emancipation, was, carried, out, in, steps, over, the, next, three, decades, usually, first, with, the, creation, of, free, womb, laws, and, programs, for, compensated, emancipation, by, the, early, 1850s, slavery, had, been, abolished, in, the, independent, nations, of, spanish, america, women, were, not, simply, spectators, throughout, the, independence, wars, of, latin, america, many, women, took, sides, on, political, issues, and, joined, independence, movements, to, participate, on, many, different, levels, women, could, not, help, but, act, as, caring, relatives, either, as, mother, sister, wives, or, daughters, of, the, men, who, were, fighting, women, created, political, organizations, and, organized, meetings, and, groups, to, donate, food, and, supplies, to, the, soldiers, some, women, supported, the, wars, as, spies, informants, and, combatants, manuela, s, enz, was, a, long, term, lover, of, sim, n, bol, var, and, acted, as, his, spy, and, confidante, and, was, secretary, of, his, archive, she, saved, his, life, on, two, occasions, nursed, wounded, soldiers, and, has, even, been, believed, some, historians, to, have, fought, in, a, few, battles, s, enz, followed, bol, var, and, his, army, through, the, independence, wars, and, became, known, in, latin, america, as, the, mother, of, feminism, and, women, s, emancipation, and, equal, rights, bol, var, himself, was, a, supporter, of, women, s, rights, and, suffrage, in, latin, america, it, was, bol, var, who, allowed, for, s, enz, to, become, the, great, pioneer, of, women, s, freedom, he, wanted, to, set, the, women, of, latin, america, free, from, the, oppression, and, inferiority, of, what, the, spanish, regime, had, established, bol, var, even, made, s, enz, a, colonel, of, the, colombian, army, due, to, her, heroics, which, caused, controversy, because, there, were, no, women, in, the, army, at, the, time, another, woman, who, gained, prominence, in, the, fight, for, independence, was, juana, azurduy, de, padilla, a, mixed, race, woman, who, fought, for, independence, in, the, r, o, de, la, plata, region, argentine, president, cristina, fern, ndez, de, kirchner, posthumously, promoted, her, to, the, rank, of, general, 82, javiera, carrera, was, also, a, significant, figure, in, the, chilean, war, of, independence, who, used, her, family, influence, and, status, to, form, social, groups, of, women, to, advocate, for, independence, carrera, sewed, the, first, chilean, flag, as, a, sign, of, their, independence, and, endured, imprisonment, multiple, times, in, her, life, as, a, result, of, her, great, contributions, she, is, seen, as, one, of, the, main, female, figures, in, chilean, independence, another, significant, figure, in, documenting, the, experiences, of, women, during, the, independence, wars, was, marquita, sanchez, also, known, as, madame, mendeville, sanchez, recorded, many, of, her, experiences, during, the, argentine, independence, war, while, also, recording, account, of, her, daily, life, as, a, female, activist, during, this, period, in, history, she, also, helped, record, several, events, and, battles, central, to, the, argentine, military, and, their, continued, fighting, against, the, spanish, according, to, gender, stereotypes, women, were, not, meant, to, be, soldiers, only, men, were, supposed, to, engage, in, fighting, and, conflict, there, were, still, plenty, of, women, present, on, the, battlefields, to, help, rescue, and, nurse, soldiers, some, women, fought, alongside, their, husbands, and, sons, on, the, battlefield, the, majority, of, women, assumed, supportive, and, non, competitive, roles, such, as, fundraising, and, caring, for, the, sick, revolution, for, women, meant, something, different, from, for, men, women, saw, revolution, as, a, way, to, earn, equal, rights, such, as, voting, and, to, overcome, the, suppression, of, subordination, of, women, to, men, women, were, usually, identified, as, victims, during, the, independence, wars, since, the, women, of, latin, america, were, forced, to, sacrifice, for, the, cause, the, ideals, of, womanhood, meant, that, women, must, sacrifice, what, the, situation, required, such, as, a, mother, sacrificing, her, son, or, a, virgin, knowing, she, might, be, sacrificing, motherhood, or, marriage, due, to, the, loss, of, many, young, men, this, view, meant, that, women, were, meant, to, contribute, to, independence, in, a, supportive, role, while, leaving, the, combat, and, politics, in, the, hands, of, the, men, independence, also, did, not, result, in, stable, political, regimes, save, in, a, few, countries, first, the, new, nations, did, not, have, well, defined, identities, rather, the, process, of, creating, identities, was, only, beginning, this, process, would, be, carried, out, through, newspapers, and, the, creation, of, national, symbols, including, new, names, for, the, countries, mexico, colombia, ecuador, bolivia, argentina, that, broke, with, the, past, in, addition, the, borders, were, not, firmly, established, and, the, struggle, between, federalism, and, centralism, which, began, in, independence, continued, throughout, the, rest, of, the, century, two, large, states, that, emerged, from, the, wars, gran, colombia, and, the, federal, republic, of, central, america, collapsed, after, a, decade, or, two, and, argentina, would, not, consolidate, politically, until, the, 1860s, the, wars, destroyed, the, old, civilian, bureaucracy, that, had, governed, the, region, for, centuries, as, institutions, such, as, the, audiencias, were, eliminated, and, many, peninsular, officials, fled, to, spain, the, catholic, church, which, had, been, an, important, social, and, political, institution, during, the, colonial, period, initially, came, out, weakened, by, the, end, of, the, conflicts, as, with, government, officials, many, peninsular, bishops, abandoned, their, dioceses, and, their, posts, were, not, filled, for, decades, until, new, prelates, could, be, created, and, relations, between, the, new, nations, and, the, vatican, were, regularized, then, as, the, church, recovered, its, economic, and, political, power, was, attacked, by, liberals, despite, the, fact, that, the, period, of, the, wars, of, independence, itself, was, marked, by, a, rapid, expansion, of, representative, government, for, several, of, the, new, nations, the, nineteenth, century, was, marked, by, militarism, because, of, the, lack, of, well, defined, political, and, national, institutions, the, armies, and, officers, that, came, into, existence, during, the, process, of, independence, wanted, to, ensure, that, they, got, their, rewards, once, the, struggle, was, over, many, of, these, armies, did, not, fully, disband, once, the, wars, were, over, and, they, proved, to, be, one, of, the, stabler, institutions, in, the, first, decades, of, national, existence, these, armies, and, their, leaders, effectively, influenced, the, course, of, political, development, out, of, this, new, tradition, came, the, caudillos, strongmen, who, amassed, formal, and, informal, economic, military, and, political, power, in, themselves, britain, wanted, to, see, an, end, to, spanish, rule, in, south, america, and, ultimately, tap, the, monopoly, of, the, important, potential, markets, there, at, the, same, time, they, wanted, spain, as, an, ally, to, keep, the, balance, of, power, in, post, napoleonic, europe, to, fulfil, this, britain, went, covert, in, support, of, the, revolutionaries, in, south, america, in, a, kind, of, private, free, enterprise, going, by, the, law, she, sent, men, financial, and, material, support, to, help, the, insurgents, fight, against, spain, one, of, the, most, significant, contributions, were, the, british, legions, a, volunteer, unit, that, fought, under, sim, n, bol, var, this, force, numbered, upwards, of, 6, 000, men, the, majority, of, whom, were, composed, of, veterans, of, the, napoleonic, wars, 217, 220, in, combat, their, greatest, achievements, were, at, boyac, 1819, carabobo, 1821, pichincha, 1822, and, ayacucho, 1824, which, secured, independence, for, colombia, venezuela, ecuador, and, peru, from, spanish, rule, respectively, bol, var, described, the, legions, and, all, who, served, in, them, as, the, saviours, of, my, country, many, members, of, the, royal, navy, also, volunteered, for, the, revolutionary, forces, the, most, famous, being, thomas, cochrane, who, reorganised, the, chilean, navy, most, of, whom, were, composed, of, royal, navy, veterans, amongst, many, feats, he, captured, the, spanish, fortress, of, valdivia, in, 1820, and, in, the, same, year, he, captured, the, flagship, of, the, spanish, south, american, fleet, the, esmeralda, in, the, port, of, callao, as, well, as, helping, chile, gain, independence, from, spain, cochrane, did, the, same, for, peru, too, by, mounting, an, effective, blockade, and, transporting, troops, he, then, moved, on, to, brazil, in, their, fight, for, independence, from, portugal, at, their, peak, by, 1819, around, 10, 000, men, from, the, british, isles, served, in, south, america, to, fight, against, the, spanish, british, diplomacy, also, played, a, key, role, in, particular, the, role, of, foreign, secretaries, viscount, castlereagh, and, later, george, canning, both, of, whom, wanted, to, see, the, demise, of, spain, s, south, american, colonies, castlereagh, s, greatest, achievement, was, to, settle, a, deal, with, the, european, powers, at, the, congress, of, aix, la, chapelle, in, 1818, and, the, congress, of, verona, four, years, later, this, blocked, aid, to, spain, which, inhibited, her, reconquest, of, south, america, with, the, royal, navy, in, command, of, the, oceans, this, set, the, precedence, they, were, also, a, decisive, factor, in, the, struggle, for, independence, of, certain, latin, american, countries, napoleon, bonaparte, wanted, to, dominate, the, iberian, peninsula, and, spanish, america, joseph, bonaparte, his, brother, appointed, king, of, spain, and, its, colonies, 1808, 1813, never, signed, a, document, for, latin, american, independence, napoleon, did, not, relinquish, any, of, these, rights, and, upon, losing, the, war, in, spain, restored, the, spanish, crown, to, his, prisoner, ferdinand, vii, in, 1813, in, full, in, the, treaty, of, valen, ay, france, s, subsequent, role, after, the, restoration, of, bourbon, rule, was, that, of, an, ally, of, ferdinand, vii, in, the, iberian, peninsula, until, the, end, of, the, war, supporting, the, installation, of, absolutism, in, spain, ominous, decade, through, the, military, intervention, called, hundred, thousand, sons, of, saint, louis, but, it, never, provided, material, or, combatants, for, the, wars, of, emancipation, for, support, royalist, or, patriots, the, intervention, of, the, united, states, was, due, to, two, distinct, causes, a, territorial, annexation, and, a, revolts, within, the, spanish, territories, itself, the, republic, of, west, florida, was, a, short, lived, republic, in, 1810, in, the, westernmost, region, of, spanish, west, florida, which, after, less, than, three, months, was, annexed, and, occupied, by, the, united, states, a, little, later, in, 1810, and, then, became, part, of, the, territory, of, louisiana, the, republic, of, east, florida, was, another, republic, declared, against, spanish, rule, of, east, florida, by, insurgents, who, wanted, its, annexation, by, the, united, states, without, success, in, 1819, the, treaty, of, florida, was, signed, between, spain, and, the, united, states, and, spain, ceded, all, of, florida, to, the, united, states, in, 1811, the, spanish, crushed, the, san, antonio, texas, revolt, during, the, revolution, against, the, royalists, in, the, mexican, war, of, independence, the, remaining, rebels, then, turned, to, the, united, states, for, help, bernardo, guti, rrez, de, lara, traveled, to, washington, d, c, gutierrez, gained, the, support, of, augustus, magee, and, formed, a, u, s, filibuster, force, in, louisiana, a, green, flag, from, the, expedition, represented, the, rebels, the, northern, republican, army, was, defeated, in, the, bloodiest, battle, in, texas, the, battle, of, medina, thus, texas, was, incorporated, into, the, mexican, independence, and, later, texas, independence, and, its, annexation, to, the, united, states, took, place, the, united, states, remained, neutral, thus, for, the, rest, of, madison, s, term, until, 1817, the, theoretical, neutrality, pending, the, development, of, events, in, the, old, world, madison, s, policy, of, neutrality, favored, insurgents, and, this, along, with, the, border, line, problems, in, north, america, led, to, a, situation, of, pre, war, tension, with, spain, this, situation, forced, the, united, states, to, act, very, cautiously, in, the, spanish, american, issue, since, it, was, trying, to, avoid, at, all, costs, to, give, an, excuse, for, european, intervention, at, the, end, the, recognition, in, 1822, also, was, very, delicate, at, the, international, level, the, north, american, position, against, european, powers, the, spanish, navy, had, been, totally, dismantled, by, a, disastrous, naval, policy, and, relegated, to, the, background, by, the, urgency, of, the, war, against, napoleon, itself, to, 1817, tsar, alexander, supported, reactionary, governments, ferdinand, vii, applied, to, the, tsar, to, purchase, vessels, the, tsar, agreed, to, this, request, with, the, offer, of, the, sale, of, some, of, his, own, vessels, the, agreement, was, finally, negotiated, at, madrid, between, dmitry, tatishchev, russian, ambassador, and, eguia, minister, of, war, it, was, apparently, known, only, to, these, two, and, to, the, king, himself, the, text, of, the, treaty, of, sale, has, not, been, found, in, the, spanish, naval, archives, this, diplomatic, transaction, was, veiled, in, the, deepest, secrecy, against, spanish, navy, and, minister, of, navy, the, requested, fleet, would, consist, of, 5, warships, and, 3, frigates, the, squadron, would, be, delivered, to, cadiz, duly, armed, and, supplied, the, arrival, of, the, russian, fleet, in, cadiz, in, february, 1818, was, not, to, the, liking, of, the, spanish, navy, which, was, dissatisfied, with, the, state, of, deterioration, in, which, some, supposedly, new,
