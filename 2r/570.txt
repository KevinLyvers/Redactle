https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor
the, holodomor, also, known, as, the, ukrainian, famine, was, a, man, made, famine, in, soviet, ukraine, from, 1932, to, 1933, that, killed, millions, of, ukrainians, the, holodomor, was, part, of, the, wider, soviet, famine, of, 1930, 1933, which, affected, the, major, grain, producing, areas, of, the, soviet, union, while, scholars, are, in, consensus, that, the, cause, of, the, famine, was, man, made, it, remains, in, dispute, whether, the, holodomor, was, directed, at, ukrainians, and, whether, it, constitutes, a, genocide, the, point, of, contention, being, the, absence, of, attested, documents, explicitly, ordering, the, starvation, of, any, area, in, the, soviet, union, some, historians, conclude, that, the, famine, was, deliberately, engineered, by, joseph, stalin, to, eliminate, a, ukrainian, independence, movement, others, suggest, that, the, famine, was, primarily, the, consequence, of, rapid, soviet, industrialisation, and, collectivization, of, agriculture, a, middle, position, held, for, example, by, historian, andrea, graziosi, is, that, the, initial, causes, of, the, famine, were, an, unintentional, byproduct, of, the, process, of, collectivization, but, once, it, set, in, starvation, was, selectively, weaponized, and, the, famine, was, instrumentalized, and, amplified, against, ukrainians, to, punish, them, for, their, rejection, of, the, new, serfdom, and, to, break, their, nationalism, ukraine, was, one, of, the, largest, grain, producing, states, in, the, ussr, and, was, subject, to, unreasonably, high, grain, quotas, compared, to, the, rest, of, the, ussr, this, caused, ukraine, to, be, hit, particularly, hard, by, the, famine, early, estimates, of, the, death, toll, by, scholars, and, government, officials, vary, greatly, a, joint, statement, to, the, united, nations, signed, by, 25, countries, in, 2003, declared, that, 7, to, 10, million, died, however, current, scholarship, estimates, a, range, significantly, lower, with, 3, 5, to, 5, million, victims, the, famine, s, widespread, impact, on, ukraine, persists, to, this, day, public, discussion, of, the, famine, was, banned, in, the, soviet, union, until, the, glasnost, period, initiated, by, mikhail, gorbachev, in, the, 1980s, since, 2006, the, holodomor, has, been, recognized, by, ukraine, and, 33, other, un, member, states, the, european, parliament, and, 35, of, the, 50, states, of, the, united, states, as, a, genocide, against, the, ukrainian, people, carried, out, by, the, soviet, government, in, 2008, the, russian, state, duma, condemned, the, soviet, regime, that, has, neglected, the, lives, of, people, for, the, achievement, of, economic, and, political, goals, holodomor, literally, translated, from, ukrainian, means, death, by, hunger, killing, by, hunger, killing, by, starvation, or, sometimes, murder, by, hunger, or, starvation, it, is, a, compound, of, the, ukrainian, holod, hunger, and, mor, plague, the, expression, holodom, moryty, means, to, inflict, death, by, hunger, the, ukrainian, verb, moryty, means, to, poison, to, drive, to, exhaustion, or, to, torment, the, perfective, form, of, moryty, is, zamoryty, kill, or, drive, to, death, in, english, the, holodomor, has, also, been, referred, to, as, the, artificial, famine, terror, genocide, and, the, great, famine, it, was, used, in, print, in, the, 1930s, in, ukrainian, diaspora, publications, in, czechoslovakia, as, haladamor, and, by, ukrainian, immigrant, organisations, in, the, united, states, and, canada, by, 1978, in, the, soviet, union, of, which, ukraine, was, a, constituent, republic, any, references, to, the, famine, were, dismissed, as, anti, soviet, propaganda, even, after, de, stalinization, in, 1956, until, the, declassification, and, publication, of, historical, documents, in, the, late, 1980s, made, continued, denial, of, the, catastrophe, unsustainable, discussion, of, the, holodomor, became, possible, as, part, of, the, soviet, glasnost, openness, policy, in, the, 1980s, in, ukraine, the, first, official, use, of, famine, was, in, a, december, 1987, speech, by, volodymyr, shcherbytskyi, first, secretary, of, the, central, committee, of, the, communist, party, of, ukraine, on, the, occasion, of, the, republic, s, 70th, anniversary, another, early, public, usage, in, the, soviet, union, was, in, a, february, 1988, speech, by, oleksiy, musiyenko, deputy, secretary, for, ideological, matters, of, the, party, organisation, of, the, kyiv, branch, of, the, union, of, soviet, writers, in, ukraine, the, term, holodomor, may, have, first, appeared, in, print, in, the, soviet, union, on, 18, july, 1988, when, musiyenko, s, article, on, the, topic, was, published, holodomor, is, now, an, entry, in, the, modern, two, volume, dictionary, of, the, ukrainian, language, published, in, 2004, described, as, artificial, hunger, organised, on, a, vast, scale, by, a, criminal, regime, against, a, country, s, population, according, to, elazar, barkan, elizabeth, a, cole, and, kai, struve, the, holodomor, has, been, described, as, a, ukrainian, holocaust, they, assert, that, since, the, 1990s, the, term, holodomor, has, been, widely, adopted, by, anti, communists, in, order, to, draw, parallels, to, the, holocaust, however, this, term, has, been, criticized, by, some, academics, as, the, holocaust, was, a, heavily, documented, coordinated, effort, by, nazi, germany, and, its, collaborators, to, eliminate, certain, ethnic, groups, such, as, jews, by, contrast, there, is, no, definitive, documentation, that, stalin, directly, ordered, the, mass, murder, of, ukrainians, barkan, et, al, state, that, the, term, holodomor, was, introduced, and, popularized, by, the, ukrainian, diaspora, in, north, america, before, ukraine, became, independent, and, that, the, term, holocaust, in, reference, to, the, famine, is, not, explained, at, all, the, famine, affected, the, ukrainian, ssr, as, well, as, the, moldavian, autonomous, soviet, socialist, republic, a, part, of, the, ukrainian, ssr, at, the, time, in, spring, 1932, and, from, february, to, july, 1933, with, the, most, victims, recorded, in, spring, 1933, the, consequences, are, evident, in, demographic, statistics, between, 1926, and, 1939, the, ukrainian, population, increased, by, only, 6, 6, whereas, russia, and, belarus, grew, by, 16, 9, and, 11, 7, respectively, the, number, of, ukrainians, as, ethnicity, decreased, by, 10, from, the, 1932, harvest, soviet, authorities, were, able, to, procure, only, 4, 3, million, tons, of, grain, as, compared, with, 7, 2, million, tons, obtained, from, the, 1931, harvest, rations, in, towns, were, drastically, cut, back, and, in, winter, 1932, 1933, and, spring, 1933, people, in, many, urban, areas, starved, urban, workers, were, supplied, by, a, rationing, system, and, therefore, could, occasionally, assist, their, starving, relatives, in, the, countryside, but, rations, were, gradually, cut, by, spring, 1933, urban, residents, also, faced, starvation, it, is, estimated, 70, to, 80, of, all, famine, deaths, during, the, holodomor, in, eight, analyzed, oblasts, in, the, soviet, union, occurred, in, the, first, seven, months, of, 1933, the, first, reports, of, mass, malnutrition, and, deaths, from, starvation, emerged, from, two, urban, areas, of, the, city, of, uman, reported, in, january, 1933, by, vinnytsia, and, kyiv, oblasts, by, mid, january, 1933, there, were, reports, about, mass, difficulties, with, food, in, urban, areas, which, had, been, undersupplied, through, the, rationing, system, and, deaths, from, starvation, among, people, who, were, refused, rations, according, to, the, december, 1932, decree, of, the, central, committee, of, the, ukrainian, communist, party, by, the, beginning, of, february, 1933, according, to, reports, from, local, authorities, and, ukrainian, gpu, secret, police, the, most, affected, area, was, dnipropetrovsk, oblast, which, also, suffered, from, epidemics, of, typhus, and, malaria, odesa, and, kyiv, oblasts, were, second, and, third, respectively, by, mid, march, most, of, the, reports, of, starvation, originated, from, kyiv, oblast, by, mid, april, 1933, kharkiv, oblast, reached, the, top, of, the, most, affected, list, while, kyiv, dnipropetrovsk, odesa, vinnytsia, and, donetsk, oblasts, and, moldavian, ssr, were, next, on, the, list, reports, about, mass, deaths, from, starvation, dated, mid, may, through, the, beginning, of, june, 1933, originated, from, raions, in, kyiv, and, kharkiv, oblasts, the, less, affected, list, noted, chernihiv, oblast, and, northern, parts, of, kyiv, and, vinnytsia, oblasts, the, central, committee, of, the, cp, b, of, ukraine, decree, of, 8, february, 1933, said, no, hunger, cases, should, have, remained, untreated, the, ukrainian, weekly, which, was, tracking, the, situation, in, 1933, reported, the, difficulties, in, communications, and, the, appalling, situation, in, ukraine, local, authorities, had, to, submit, reports, about, the, numbers, suffering, from, hunger, the, reasons, for, hunger, number, of, deaths, from, hunger, food, aid, provided, from, local, sources, and, centrally, provided, food, aid, required, the, gpu, managed, parallel, reporting, and, food, assistance, in, the, ukrainian, ssr, many, regional, reports, and, most, of, the, central, summary, reports, are, available, from, present, day, central, and, regional, ukrainian, archives, the, overlying, causes, for, the, famine, are, still, disputed, some, scholars, suggest, that, the, famine, was, a, consequence, of, human, made, and, natural, factors, the, most, prevalent, man, made, factor, was, changes, made, to, agriculture, because, of, rapid, industrialisation, during, the, first, five, year, plan, there, are, also, those, who, blame, a, systematic, set, of, policies, perpetrated, by, the, soviet, government, under, stalin, designed, to, exterminate, the, ukrainians, according, to, historian, stephen, g, wheatcroft, the, grain, yield, for, the, soviet, union, preceding, the, famine, was, a, low, harvest, of, between, 55, and, 60, million, tons, likely, in, part, caused, by, damp, weather, and, low, traction, power, yet, official, statistics, mistakenly, reported, a, yield, of, 68, 9, million, tons, note, that, a, single, ton, of, grain, is, enough, to, feed, three, people, for, one, year, historian, mark, tauger, has, suggested, that, drought, and, damp, weather, were, causes, of, the, low, harvest, mark, tauger, suggested, that, heavy, rains, would, help, the, harvest, while, stephen, wheatcroft, suggested, it, would, hurt, it, which, natalya, naumenko, notes, as, a, disagreement, in, scholarship, another, factor, which, reduced, the, harvest, suggested, by, tauger, included, endemic, plant, rust, however, in, regard, to, plant, disease, stephen, wheatcroft, notes, that, the, soviet, extension, of, sown, area, combined, with, lack, of, crop, rotation, may, have, exacerbated, the, problem, which, tauger, also, acknowledges, in, regard, to, the, latter, due, to, factional, struggles, with, bukharin, wing, of, the, party, peasant, resistance, to, the, nep, under, lenin, and, the, need, for, industrialization, joseph, stalin, declared, a, need, to, extract, a, tribute, or, tax, from, the, peasantry, this, idea, was, supported, by, most, of, the, party, in, the, 1920s, the, tribute, collected, by, the, party, took, on, the, form, of, a, virtual, war, against, the, peasantry, that, would, lead, to, its, cultural, destruction, and, the, relegating, of, the, countryside, to, essentially, a, colony, homogenized, to, the, urban, culture, of, the, soviet, elite, leon, trotsky, however, opposed, the, policy, of, forced, collectivisation, under, stalin, and, would, have, favoured, a, voluntary, gradual, approach, towards, collective, farming, with, greater, tolerance, for, the, rights, of, soviet, ukrainians, this, campaign, of, colonizing, the, peasantry, had, its, roots, both, in, old, russian, imperialism, and, modern, social, engineering, of, the, nation, state, yet, with, key, differences, to, the, latter, such, as, soviet, repression, reflecting, more, the, weakness, of, said, state, rather, than, its, strength, in, this, vein, by, the, summer, of, 1930, the, government, instituted, a, program, of, food, requisitioning, ostensibly, to, increase, grain, exports, according, to, natalya, naumenko, collectivization, in, the, soviet, union, and, lack, of, favored, industries, were, primary, contributors, to, famine, mortality, 52, of, excess, deaths, and, some, evidence, shows, there, was, discrimination, against, ethnic, ukrainians, and, germans, in, ukraine, collectivisation, policy, was, enforced, entailing, extreme, crisis, and, contributing, to, the, famine, in, 1929, 1930, peasants, were, induced, to, transfer, land, and, livestock, to, state, owned, farms, on, which, they, would, work, as, day, labourers, for, payment, in, kind, food, exports, continued, during, the, famine, albeit, at, a, reduced, rate, in, regard, to, exports, michael, ellman, states, that, the, 1932, 1933, grain, exports, amounted, to, 1, 8, million, tonnes, which, would, have, been, enough, to, feed, 5, million, people, for, one, year, the, collectivization, and, high, procurement, quota, explanation, for, the, famine, is, somewhat, called, into, question, by, the, fact, that, the, oblasts, of, ukraine, with, the, highest, losses, were, kyiv, and, kharkiv, which, produced, far, lower, amounts, of, grain, than, other, sections, of, the, country, historian, stephen, g, wheatcroft, lists, four, problems, soviet, authorities, ignored, during, collectivization, that, would, hinder, the, advancement, of, agricultural, technology, and, ultimately, contributed, to, the, famine, mark, tauger, notes, that, soviet, and, western, specialist, at, the, time, noted, draught, power, shortages, and, lack, of, crop, rotation, contributed, to, intense, weed, infestations, with, these, both, being, also, factors, stephen, wheatcroft, lists, as, contributing, to, the, famine, natalya, naumenko, calculated, that, reduced, agriculture, production, in, collectivized, collective, farms, is, responsible, for, up, to, 52, of, holodomor, excess, deaths, at, every, station, there, was, a, crowd, of, peasants, in, rags, offering, icons, and, linen, in, exchange, for, a, loaf, of, bread, the, women, were, lifting, up, their, infants, to, the, compartment, windows, infants, pitiful, and, terrifying, with, limbs, like, sticks, puffed, bellies, big, cadaverous, heads, lolling, on, thin, necks, arthur, koestler, hungarian, british, journalist, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, soviet, leadership, used, the, human, made, famine, to, attack, ukrainian, nationalism, and, thus, it, could, fall, under, the, legal, definition, of, genocide, for, example, special, and, particularly, lethal, policies, were, adopted, in, and, largely, limited, to, soviet, ukraine, at, the, end, of, 1932, and, 1933, according, to, timothy, snyder, each, of, them, may, seem, like, an, anodyne, administrative, measure, and, each, of, them, was, certainly, presented, as, such, at, the, time, and, yet, each, had, to, kill, other, sources, discuss, the, famine, in, relation, to, a, project, of, imperialism, or, colonialism, of, ukraine, by, the, soviet, state, according, to, a, centre, for, economic, policy, research, paper, published, in, 2021, by, andrei, markevich, natalya, naumenko, and, nancy, qian, regions, with, higher, ukrainian, population, shares, were, struck, harder, with, centrally, planned, policies, corresponding, to, famine, such, as, increased, procurement, rate, and, ukrainian, populated, areas, were, given, lower, numbers, of, tractors, which, the, paper, argues, demonstrates, that, ethnic, discrimination, across, the, board, was, centrally, planned, ultimately, concluding, that, 92, of, famine, deaths, in, ukraine, alone, along, with, 77, of, famine, deaths, in, ukraine, russia, and, belarus, combined, can, be, explained, by, systematic, bias, against, ukrainians, mark, tauger, criticized, natalya, naumenko, s, work, as, being, based, on, major, historical, inaccuracies, and, falsehoods, omissions, of, essential, evidence, contained, in, her, sources, or, easily, available, and, substantial, misunderstandings, of, certain, key, topics, for, example, naumenko, ignored, tauger, s, findings, of, 8, 94, million, tons, of, the, harvest, that, had, been, lost, to, crop, rust, and, smut, four, reductions, in, grain, procurement, to, ukraine, including, a, 39, 5, million, puds, reduction, in, grain, procurements, ordered, by, stalin, and, that, from, tauger, s, findings, which, are, contrary, to, naumenko, s, paper, s, claims, the, per, capita, grain, procurements, in, ukraine, were, less, often, significantly, less, than, the, per, capita, procurements, from, the, five, other, main, grain, producing, regions, in, the, ussr, in, 1932, other, scholars, argue, that, in, other, years, preceding, the, famine, this, was, not, the, case, for, example, stanislav, kulchytsky, claims, ukraine, produced, more, grain, in, 1930, than, the, central, black, earth, oblast, middle, and, lower, volga, and, north, caucasus, regions, all, together, which, had, never, been, done, before, and, on, average, gave, 4, 7, quintals, of, grain, from, every, sown, hectare, to, the, state, a, record, breaking, index, of, marketability, but, was, unable, to, fullfill, the, grain, quota, for, 1930, until, may, 1931, ukraine, produced, a, similar, amount, of, grain, in, 1931, however, by, the, late, spring, of, 1932, many, districts, were, left, with, no, reserves, of, produce, or, fodder, at, all, despite, this, according, to, statistics, gathered, by, nataliia, levchuk, ukraine, and, north, caucasus, krai, delivered, almost, 100, of, their, grain, procurement, in, 1931, versus, 67, in, two, russian, oblasts, during, the, same, period, versus, 1932, where, three, russian, regions, delivered, almost, all, of, their, procurements, and, ukraine, and, north, caucasus, did, not, this, can, partially, be, explained, by, ukrainian, regions, losing, a, third, of, their, harvests, and, russian, regions, losing, by, comparison, only, 15, of, their, harvest, ultimately, tauger, states, if, the, regime, had, not, taken, even, that, smaller, amount, grain, from, ukrainian, villages, the, famine, could, have, been, greatly, reduced, or, even, eliminated, however, in, his, words, if, the, regime, had, left, that, grain, in, ukraine, then, other, parts, of, the, ussr, would, have, been, even, more, deprived, of, food, than, they, were, including, ukrainian, cities, and, industrial, sites, and, the, overall, effect, would, still, have, been, a, major, famine, even, worse, in, non, ukrainian, regions, in, fact, in, contrast, to, naumenko, s, paper, s, claims, the, higher, ukrainian, collectivization, rates, in, tauger, s, opinion, actually, indicate, a, pro, ukrainian, bias, in, soviet, policies, rather, than, an, anti, ukrainian, one, did, not, see, collectivization, as, discrimination, against, ukrainians, they, saw, it, as, a, reflection, of, in, the, leaders, view, ukraine, s, relatively, more, advanced, farming, skills, that, made, ukraine, better, prepared, for, collectivization, davies, 1980a, 166, 187, 188, tauger, 2006a, naumenko, responded, to, some, of, tauger, s, criticisms, in, another, paper, naumenko, criticizes, tauger, s, view, of, the, efficacy, of, collective, farms, arguing, tauger, s, view, goes, against, the, consensus, she, also, states, that, the, tenfold, difference, in, death, toll, between, the, 1932, 1933, soviet, famine, and, the, russian, famine, of, 1891, 1892, can, only, be, explained, by, government, policies, and, that, the, infestations, of, pests, and, plant, disease, suggested, by, tauger, as, a, cause, of, the, famine, must, also, correspond, such, infestations, to, rates, of, collectivization, due, to, deaths, by, area, corresponding, to, this, due, naumenko, s, findings, that, on, average, if, you, compare, two, regions, with, similar, pre, famine, characteristics, one, with, zero, collectivization, rate, and, another, with, a, 100, percent, collectivization, rate, the, more, collectivized, region, s, 1933, mortality, rate, increases, by, 58, per, thousand, relative, to, its, 1927, 1928, mortality, rate, naumenko, believes, the, disagreement, between, her, and, tauger, is, due, to, a, gulf, in, training, and, methods, between, quantitative, fields, like, political, science, and, economics, and, qualitative, fields, like, history, noting, that, tauger, makes, no, comments, on, one, of, her, paper, s, results, section, tauger, made, a, counter, reply, to, this, reply, by, naumenko, tauger, argues, in, his, counter, reply, that, naumenko, s, attempt, to, correspond, collectivization, rates, to, famine, mortality, fails, because, there, was, no, single, level, of, collectivization, anywhere, in, the, ussr, in, 1930, especially, in, the, ukrainian, republic, and, that, since, collectivization, changed, significantly, by, 1932, 1933, any, connection, between, 1930, and, 1933, omits, those, changes, and, is, therefore, invalid, tauger, also, criticizes, naumenko, s, ignoring, of, statistics, tauger, s, presented, where, in, her, reply, she, completely, ignored, the, quantitative, data, presented, in, article, in, which, she, against, the, evidence, denied, that, any, famines, took, place, in, the, later, 1920s, to, counter, naumenko, s, claim, that, collectivization, explains, the, famine, tauger, argues, in, his, words, how, agro, environmental, disasters, better, explain, the, regional, discrepancies, calculations, again, omit, any, consideration, of, the, agro, environmental, disasters, that, harmed, farm, production, in, 1932, in, her, appendices, table, c3, she, does, the, same, calculation, with, collectivization, data, from, 1932, which, she, argues, shows, a, closer, correlation, between, collectivization, and, famine, mortality, naumenko, 2021b, 33, yet, as, i, showed, those, agroenvironmental, disasters, were, much, worse, in, the, regions, with, higher, collectivization, especially, ukraine, the, north, caucasus, and, the, volga, river, basin, and, also, in, kazakhstan, than, elsewhere, in, the, ussr, as, i, documented, in, my, article, and, other, publications, these, were, regions, that, had, a, history, of, environmental, disasters, that, caused, crop, failures, and, famines, repeatedly, in, russian, history, tauger, notes, assumption, that, collectivization, subjected, peasants, to, higher, procurements, but, in, 1932, in, ukraine, this, was, clearly, not, the, case, as, grain, procurements, both, total, and, per, capita, were, much, lower, in, ukraine, than, anywhere, else, in, the, ussr, in, 1932, soviet, institutions, policies, collectivization, in, the, soviet, union, including, the, ukrainian, ssr, was, not, popular, among, the, peasantry, and, forced, collectivisation, led, to, numerous, peasant, revolts, the, ogpu, recorded, 932, disturbances, in, ukraine, 173, in, the, north, caucasus, and, only, 43, in, the, central, black, earth, oblast, out, of, 1, 630, total, reports, two, years, prior, recorded, over, 4, 000, unrests, in, ukraine, while, in, other, agricultural, regions, central, black, earth, middle, volga, lower, volga, and, north, caucasus, the, numbers, were, sightly, above, 1, 000, ogpu, s, summaries, also, cited, public, proclamations, of, ukrainian, insurgents, to, restore, the, independence, of, ukraine, while, reports, by, the, ukrainian, officials, included, information, about, the, declining, popularity, and, authority, of, the, party, among, peasants, oleh, wolowyna, comments, that, peasant, resistance, and, the, ensuing, repression, of, said, resistance, was, a, critical, factor, for, the, famine, in, ukraine, and, parts, of, russia, populated, by, national, minorities, like, germans, and, ukrainians, allegedly, tainted, by, fascism, and, bourgeois, nationalism, according, to, soviet, authorities, the, collectivization, and, high, procurement, quota, explanation, for, the, famine, is, called, into, question, by, the, fact, that, the, oblasts, of, ukraine, with, the, highest, losses, were, kyiv, and, kharkiv, which, produced, far, lower, amounts, of, grain, than, other, sections, of, the, country, a, potential, explanation, for, this, was, that, kharkiv, and, kyiv, fulfilled, and, over, fulfilled, their, grain, procurements, in, 1930, which, led, to, raions, in, these, oblasts, having, their, procurement, quotas, doubled, in, 1931, compared, to, the, national, average, increase, in, procurement, rate, of, 9, while, kharkiv, and, kyiv, had, their, quotas, increased, the, odesa, oblast, and, some, raions, of, dnipropetrovsk, oblast, had, their, procurement, quotas, decreased, according, to, nataliia, levchuk, of, the, ptoukha, institute, of, demography, and, social, studies, the, distribution, of, the, largely, increased, 1931, grain, quotas, in, kharkiv, and, kyiv, oblasts, by, raion, was, very, uneven, and, unjustified, because, it, was, done, disproportionally, to, the, percentage, of, wheat, sown, area, and, their, potential, grain, capacity, several, repressive, policies, were, implemented, in, ukraine, immediately, preceding, during, and, proceeding, the, famine, including, but, not, limited, to, cultural, religious, persecution, the, law, of, spikelets, blacklisting, the, internal, passport, system, and, harsh, grain, requisitions, coiner, of, the, term, genocide, raphael, lemkin, considered, the, repression, of, the, orthodox, church, to, be, a, prong, of, genocide, against, ukrainians, when, seen, in, correlation, to, the, holodomor, famine, collectivization, did, not, just, entail, the, acquisition, of, land, from, farmers, but, also, the, closing, of, churches, burning, of, icons, and, the, arrests, of, priests, associating, the, church, with, the, tsarist, regime, the, soviet, state, continued, to, undermine, the, church, through, expropriations, and, repression, they, cut, off, state, financial, support, to, the, church, and, secularized, church, schools, by, early, 1930, 75, of, the, autocephalist, parishes, in, ukraine, were, persecuted, by, soviet, authorities, the, gpu, instigated, a, show, trial, which, denounced, the, orthodox, church, in, ukraine, as, a, nationalist, political, counter, revolutionary, organization, and, instigated, a, staged, self, dissolution, however, the, church, was, later, allowed, to, reorganize, in, december, 1930, under, a, pro, soviet, cosmopolitan, leader, of, ivan, pavlovsky, yet, purges, of, the, church, reignited, during, the, great, purge, changes, in, cultural, politics, also, occurred, first, soviet, show, trial, in, ukraine, in, connection, to, the, member, of, the, ukrainian, socialist, revolutionary, party, has, taken, place, as, early, as, 1921, yet, the, first, show, trial, related, to, ukraine, in, the, period, of, the, first, five, year, plan, was, a, trial, in, 1928, in, north, caucasus, krai, known, as, shakhty, trial, prior, to, this, in, october, 1925, shakhty, okrug, previously, part, of, donets, governorate, was, transferred, from, ukrainian, ssr, to, rsfsr, and, thus, the, trial, was, held, in, moscow, yet, one, of, the, central, ones, was, the, union, for, the, freedom, of, ukraine, trial, in, which, 45, intellectuals, higher, education, professors, writers, a, theologian, and, a, priest, were, publicly, prosecuted, in, kharkiv, then, capital, of, soviet, ukraine, fifteen, of, the, accused, were, executed, and, 248, with, links, to, the, defendants, were, sent, to, the, camps, ukrainian, youth, association, was, also, considered, a, sub, division, of, the, union, for, freedom, of, ukraine, and, thus, its, members, were, also, trialed, other, notable, ukrainian, processes, included, people, s, revolutionary, socialist, party, trial, in, 1930, it, was, claimed, that, this, was, an, illegal, armed, insurgent, organisation, created, in, december, 1929, which, existed, in, ukraine, and, chechnya, and, ukrainian, national, center, trial, in, 1931, another, non, existent, counter, revolutionary, organisation, in, rsfsr, at, that, time, some, other, show, trials, such, as, industrial, party, trial, 1930, and, the, 1931, menshevik, trial, were, held, the, total, number, is, not, known, but, tens, of, thousands, of, people, are, estimated, to, have, been, arrested, exiled, and, or, executed, during, and, after, the, trial, including, 30, 000, intellectuals, writers, teachers, and, scientists, the, decree, about, the, protection, of, socialist, property, nicknamed, by, the, farmers, the, law, of, spikelets, was, enacted, on, 7, august, 1932, the, purpose, of, the, law, was, to, protect, the, property, of, the, kolkhoz, collective, farms, it, was, nicknamed, the, law, of, spikelets, because, it, allowed, people, to, be, prosecuted, for, gleaning, leftover, grain, from, the, fields, there, were, more, than, 200, 000, people, sentenced, under, this, law, stalin, wrote, a, letter, to, lazar, kaganovich, on, 11, september, 1932, shortly, before, kaganovich, and, vyacheslav, molotov, were, appointed, heads, of, special, commissions, to, oversee, the, grain, procurements, in, ukraine, and, kuban, a, region, populated, primarily, by, ethnic, ukrainians, at, the, time, in, which, stalin, urged, kaganovich, to, force, ukraine, into, absolute, compliance, the, main, thing, is, now, ukraine, matters, in, ukraine, are, now, extremely, bad, bad, from, the, standpoint, of, the, party, line, they, say, that, there, are, two, oblasts, of, ukraine, kyiv, and, dnipropetrovs, k, it, seems, where, almost, 50, raikomy, have, come, out, against, the, plan, of, grain, procurements, considering, them, unrealistic, in, other, raikomy, they, confirm, the, matter, is, no, better, what, does, this, look, like, this, is, no, party, but, a, parliament, a, caricature, of, a, parliament, instead, of, directing, the, districts, kosior, is, always, waffling, between, the, directives, of, the, cc, vkp, b, and, the, demands, of, the, district, party, committees, and, waffled, to, the, end, lenin, was, right, when, he, said, that, a, person, who, lacks, the, courage, at, the, necessary, moment, to, go, against, the, current, cannot, be, a, real, bolshevik, leader, bad, from, the, standpoint, of, the, soviet, line, chubar, is, no, leader, bad, from, the, standpoint, of, the, gpu, redens, lacks, the, energy, to, direct, the, struggle, with, the, counterrevolution, in, such, a, big, and, unique, republic, as, ukraine, if, we, do, not, now, correct, the, situation, in, ukraine, we, could, lose, ukraine, consider, that, pi, sudski, is, not, daydreaming, and, his, agents, in, ukraine, are, much, stronger, than, redens, or, kosior, imagine, also, consider, that, within, the, ukrainian, communist, party, 500, 000, members, ha, ha, there, are, not, a, few, yes, not, a, few, rotten, elements, that, are, conscious, or, unconscious, petliura, adherents, and, in, the, final, analysis, agents, of, pilsudski, if, the, situation, gets, any, worse, these, elements, won, t, hesitate, to, open, a, front, within, and, outside, the, party, against, the, party, worst, of, all, the, ukrainian, leadership, doesn, t, see, these, dangers, set, yourself, the, task, of, turning, ukraine, in, the, shortest, possible, time, into, a, fortress, of, the, ussr, into, the, most, inalienable, republic, don, t, worry, about, money, for, this, purpose, the, blacklist, system, was, formalized, in, 1932, by, the, 20, november, decree, the, struggle, against, kurkul, influence, in, collective, farms, blacklisting, synonymous, with, a, board, of, infamy, was, one, of, the, elements, of, agitation, propaganda, in, the, soviet, union, and, especially, ukraine, and, the, ethnically, ukrainian, kuban, region, in, the, 1930s, a, blacklisted, collective, farm, village, or, raion, district, had, its, monetary, loans, and, grain, advances, called, in, stores, closed, grain, supplies, livestock, and, food, confiscated, as, a, penalty, and, was, cut, off, from, trade, its, communist, party, and, collective, farm, committees, were, purged, and, subject, to, arrest, and, their, territory, was, forcibly, cordoned, off, by, the, ogpu, secret, police, although, nominally, targeting, collective, farms, failing, to, meet, grain, quotas, and, independent, farmers, with, outstanding, tax, in, kind, in, practice, the, punishment, was, applied, to, all, residents, of, affected, villages, and, raions, including, teachers, tradespeople, and, children, in, the, end, 37, out, of, 392, districts, along, with, at, least, 400, collective, farms, where, put, on, the, black, board, in, ukraine, more, than, half, of, the, blacklisted, farms, being, in, dnipropetrovsk, oblast, alone, every, single, raion, in, dnipropetrovsk, had, at, least, one, blacklisted, village, and, in, vinnytsia, oblast, five, entire, raions, were, blacklisted, this, oblast, is, situated, right, in, the, middle, of, traditional, lands, of, the, zaporizhian, cossacks, cossack, villages, were, also, blacklisted, in, the, volga, and, kuban, regions, of, russia, some, blacklisted, areas, in, kharkiv, could, have, death, rates, exceeding, 40, while, in, other, areas, such, as, vinnytsia, blacklisting, had, no, particular, effect, on, mortality, the, passport, system, in, the, soviet, union, identity, cards, was, introduced, on, 27, december, 1932, to, deal, with, the, exodus, of, peasants, from, the, countryside, individuals, not, having, such, a, document, could, not, leave, their, homes, on, pain, of, administrative, penalties, such, as, internment, in, labour, camps, gulag, on, 22, january, 1933, joseph, stalin, signed, a, secret, decree, restricting, travel, by, peasants, after, requests, for, bread, began, in, the, kuban, and, ukraine, soviet, authorities, blamed, the, exodus, of, peasants, during, the, famine, on, anti, soviet, elements, saying, that, like, the, outflow, from, ukraine, last, year, was, organized, by, the, enemies, of, soviet, power, there, was, a, wave, of, migration, due, to, starvation, and, authorities, responded, by, introducing, a, requirement, that, passports, be, used, to, go, between, republics, and, banning, travel, by, rail, during, march, 1933, gpu, reported, that, 219, 460, people, were, either, intercepted, and, escorted, back, or, arrested, at, its, checkpoints, meant, to, prevent, movement, of, peasants, between, districts, it, has, been, estimated, that, there, were, some, 150, 000, excess, deaths, as, a, result, of, this, policy, and, one, historian, asserts, that, these, deaths, constitute, a, crime, against, humanity, in, contrast, historian, stephen, kotkin, argues, that, the, sealing, of, the, ukrainian, borders, caused, by, the, internal, passport, system, was, in, order, to, prevent, the, spread, of, famine, related, diseases, between, january, and, mid, april, 1933, a, factor, contributing, to, a, surge, of, deaths, within, certain, regions, of, ukraine, during, the, period, was, the, relentless, search, for, alleged, hidden, grain, by, the, confiscation, of, all, food, stuffs, from, certain, households, which, stalin, implicitly, approved, of, through, a, telegram, he, sent, on, 1, january, 1933, to, the, ukrainian, government, reminding, ukrainian, farmers, of, the, severe, penalties, for, not, surrendering, grain, they, may, be, hiding, on, the, other, hand, considerable, grain, reserves, were, held, back, by, the, soviet, government, by, 1, july, 1933, around, 1, 141, 000, tons, of, grain, were, kept, in, partially, secret, reserves, which, the, government, did, not, want, to, touch, stephen, wheatcroft, mark, tauger, and, r, w, davies, conclude, it, seems, certain, that, if, stalin, had, risked, lower, levels, of, these, reserves, in, spring, and, summer, 1933, hundreds, of, thousands, perhaps, millions, of, lives, could, have, been, saved, in, order, to, make, up, for, unfulfilled, grain, procurement, quotas, in, ukraine, reserves, of, grain, were, confiscated, from, three, sources, including, according, to, oleh, wolowyna, a, grain, set, side, for, seed, for, the, next, harvest, b, a, grain, fund, for, emergencies, c, grain, issued, to, collective, farmers, for, previously, completed, work, which, had, to, be, returned, if, the, collective, farm, did, not, fulfill, its, quota, in, ukraine, there, was, a, widespread, purge, of, communist, party, officials, at, all, levels, according, to, oleh, wolowyna, 390, anti, soviet, counter, revolutionary, insurgent, and, chauvinist, groups, were, eliminated, resulting, in, 37, 797, arrests, that, led, to, 719, executions, 8, 003, people, being, sent, to, gulag, camps, and, 2, 728, being, put, into, internal, exile, 120, 000, individuals, in, ukraine, were, reviewed, in, the, first, 10, months, of, 1933, in, a, top, to, bottom, purge, of, the, communist, party, resulting, in, 23, being, eliminated, as, perceived, class, hostile, elements, pavel, postyshev, was, set, in, charge, of, placing, people, at, the, head, of, machine, tractor, stations, in, ukraine, which, were, responsible, for, purging, elements, deemed, to, be, class, hostile, the, secretary, of, the, kharkiv, oblast, referred, to, bourgeois, nationalistic, rabble, as, class, enemies, even, near, the, end, of, the, famine, by, the, end, of, 1933, 60, of, the, heads, of, village, councils, and, raion, committees, in, ukraine, were, replaced, with, an, additional, 40, 000, lower, tier, workers, being, purged, despite, the, crisis, the, soviet, government, refused, to, ask, for, foreign, aid, for, the, famine, and, persistently, denied, the, famine, s, existence, what, aid, was, given, was, selectively, distributed, to, preserve, the, collective, farm, system, grain, producing, oblasts, in, ukraine, such, as, dnipropetrovsk, were, given, more, aid, at, an, earlier, time, than, more, severely, affected, regions, like, kharkiv, which, produced, less, grain, joseph, stalin, had, quoted, vladimir, lenin, during, the, famine, declaring, he, who, does, not, work, neither, shall, he, eat, this, perspective, is, argued, by, michael, ellman, to, have, influenced, official, policy, during, the, famine, with, those, deemed, to, be, idlers, being, disfavored, in, aid, distribution, as, compared, to, those, deemed, conscientiously, working, collective, farmers, in, this, vein, olga, andriewsky, states, that, soviet, archives, indicate, that, the, most, productive, workers, were, prioritized, for, receiving, food, aid, food, rationing, in, ukraine, was, determined, by, city, categories, where, one, lived, with, capitals, and, industrial, centers, being, given, preferential, distribution, occupational, categories, with, industrial, and, railroad, workers, being, prioritized, over, blue, collar, workers, and, intelligentsia, status, in, the, family, unit, with, employed, persons, being, entitled, to, higher, rations, than, dependents, and, the, elderly, and, type, of, workplace, in, relation, to, industrialization, with, those, who, worked, in, industrial, endeavors, near, steel, mills, being, preferred, in, distribution, over, those, who, worked, in, rural, areas, or, in, food, there, was, also, migration, in, to, ukraine, as, a, response, to, the, famine, in, response, to, the, demographic, collapse, the, soviet, authorities, ordered, large, scale, resettlements, with, over, 117, 000, peasants, from, remote, regions, of, the, soviet, union, taking, over, the, deserted, farms, areas, depopulated, by, the, famine, were, resettled, by, russians, in, the, zaporizhzhia, donetsk, and, luhansk, oblasts, but, not, as, much, so, in, central, ukraine, in, some, areas, where, depopulation, was, due, to, migration, rather, than, mortality, ukrainians, returned, to, their, places, of, residence, to, find, their, homes, occupied, by, russians, leading, to, widespread, fights, between, ukrainian, farmers, and, russian, settlers, such, clashes, caused, around, one, million, russian, settlers, to, be, returned, home, evidence, of, widespread, cannibalism, was, documented, during, the, holodomor, survival, was, a, moral, as, well, as, a, physical, struggle, a, woman, doctor, wrote, to, a, friend, in, june, 1933, that, she, had, not, yet, become, a, cannibal, but, was, not, sure, that, i, shall, not, be, one, by, the, time, my, letter, reaches, you, the, good, people, died, first, those, who, refused, to, steal, or, to, prostitute, themselves, died, those, who, gave, food, to, others, died, those, who, refused, to, eat, corpses, died, those, who, refused, to, kill, their, fellow, man, died, parents, who, resisted, cannibalism, died, before, their, children, did, at, least, 2, 505, people, were, sentenced, for, cannibalism, in, the, years, 1932, and, 1933, in, ukraine, though, the, actual, number, of, cases, was, certainly, much, higher, most, cases, of, cannibalism, were, necrophagy, the, consumption, of, corpses, of, people, who, had, died, of, starvation, but, the, murder, of, children, for, food, was, common, as, well, many, survivors, told, of, neighbors, who, had, killed, and, eaten, their, own, children, one, woman, asked, why, she, had, done, this, answered, that, her, children, would, not, survive, anyway, but, this, way, she, would, she, was, arrested, by, the, police, the, police, also, documented, cases, of, children, being, kidnapped, killed, and, eaten, and, stories, of, children, being, hunted, down, as, food, circulated, in, many, areas, when, nearly, all, grain, and, all, kinds, of, animal, meat, had, been, exhausted, a, black, market, arose, in, human, flesh, and, it, may, even, have, entered, the, official, economy, the, police, kept, a, close, eye, on, butcher, shops, and, slaughterhouses, trying, to, prevent, them, from, bringing, human, flesh, into, circulation, the, italian, consul, sergio, gradenigo, nevertheless, reported, from, kharkiv, that, the, trade, of, human, meat, becomes, more, active, in, march, 1933, the, secret, police, in, kyiv, province, collected, ten, or, more, reports, of, cannibalism, every, day, but, concluded, that, in, reality, there, are, many, more, such, incidents, most, of, which, went, unreported, those, found, guilty, of, cannibalism, were, often, imprisoned, executed, or, lynched, but, while, the, authorities, were, well, informed, about, the, extent, of, cannibalism, they, also, tried, to, suppress, this, information, from, becoming, widely, known, the, chief, of, the, secret, police, warning, that, written, notes, on, the, subject, do, not, circulate, among, the, officials, where, they, might, cause, rumours, and, the, information, secretly, collected, failed, to, spur, the, soviet, government, into, action, various, reports, of, the, horrors, of, the, famine, including, the, cannibalism, were, sent, to, moscow, where, they, were, apparently, shelved, and, ignored, ukrainians, in, other, parts, of, the, soviet, union, also, experienced, famine, and, repressive, policies, rural, districts, with, ukrainian, populations, in, parts, of, the, soviet, union, outside, of, ukraine, had, higher, mortality, rates, in, russia, and, belarus, than, other, districts, this, discrepancy, did, not, however, apply, to, urban, ukrainians, in, these, areas, this, is, sometimes, viewed, as, being, connected, to, the, holodomor, in, ukraine, in, 1932, 1933, the, policies, of, forced, collectivization, of, the, ukrainian, population, of, the, soviet, union, which, caused, a, devastating, famine, that, greatly, affected, the, ukrainian, population, of, the, kuban, the, number, of, documented, victims, of, famine, in, kuban, was, at, least, 62, 000, according, to, other, historians, the, real, death, toll, is, many, times, higher, brain, boeck, thinks, the, figure, more, in, the, hundreds, of, thousands, one, source, estimate, that, during, the, soviet, famine, of, 1932, 1933, krasnodar, lost, over, 14, of, its, population, purges, were, also, extensive, in, the, region, 358, of, 716, party, secretaries, in, kuban, were, removed, along, with, 43, of, the, 25, 000, party, members, there, in, total, 40, of, the, 115, 000, to, 120, 000, rural, party, members, in, the, north, caucasus, were, removed, party, officials, associated, with, ukrainization, were, targeted, as, the, national, policy, was, viewed, to, be, connected, with, the, failure, of, grain, procurement, by, soviet, authorities, in, this, vein, the, kuban, corresponding, to, the, famine, had, a, reversal, of, the, previously, attempted, policy, of, ukrainisation, prior, to, the, reversal, of, ukrainianization, the, policy, was, failing, in, the, kuban, with, most, local, districts, not, completing, it, partially, due, to, opposition, by, local, cossack, nationalists, and, russian, chauvinists, in, the, kuban, including, by, sabotage, despite, punitive, threats, from, the, state, to, complete, the, process, made, in, may, 1932, the, large, cossack, stanitsa, poltavskaia, sabotaged, and, resisted, collectivization, more, than, any, other, area, in, the, kuban, which, was, perceived, by, lazar, kaganovich, to, be, connected, to, ukrainian, nationalist, and, cossack, conspiracy, kaganovich, relentlessly, pursued, the, policy, of, requisition, of, grain, in, poltavskaia, and, the, rest, of, the, kuban, and, personally, oversaw, the, purging, of, local, leaders, and, cossacks, kaganovich, viewed, the, resistance, of, poltavskaia, through, ukrainian, lens, delivering, oration, in, a, mixed, ukrainian, language, to, justify, this, kaganovich, cited, a, letter, allegedly, written, by, a, stanitsa, ataman, named, grigorii, omel, chenko, advocating, cossack, separatism, and, local, reports, of, resistance, to, collectivization, in, association, with, this, figure, to, substantiate, this, suspicion, of, the, area, however, kaganocvich, did, not, reveal, in, speeches, throughout, the, region, that, many, of, those, targeted, by, persecution, in, poltavskaia, had, their, family, members, and, friends, deported, or, shot, including, in, years, before, the, supposed, omel, chenko, crisis, even, started, ultimately, due, to, being, perceived, as, the, most, rebellious, area, almost, all, or, 12, 000, members, of, the, poltavskaia, stantisa, were, deported, to, the, north, this, coincided, with, and, was, a, part, of, a, wider, deportation, of, 46, 000, cossacks, from, kuban, according, to, the, holodomor, museum, 300, 000, people, were, deported, from, the, north, caucasus, between, 1930, and, 1933, two, thirds, of, them, from, the, kuban, region, likely, in, connection, to, the, affairs, in, poltavskaia, ukrainization, was, officially, reversed, in, a, decree, on, 26, december, 1932, as, stated, in, this, decree, there, was, a, two, week, deadline, to, transfer, all, publishing, and, paperwork, in, the, region, to, russian, and, the, ukrainian, language, was, effectively, banned, in, kuban, until, 1991, a, representative, of, the, ukrainian, state, publishing, house, claimed, 1, 500, ukrainian, teachers, in, the, kuban, were, either, deported, or, killed, though, this, number, has, not, been, verified, the, professional, ukrainian, theatre, in, krasnodar, was, closed, all, ukrainian, toponyms, in, the, kuban, which, reflected, the, areas, from, which, the, first, ukrainians, settlers, had, moved, were, changed, the, names, of, stanytsias, such, as, the, rural, town, of, kyiv, in, krasnodar, was, changed, to, krasnoartilyevskaya, and, uman, to, leningrad, and, poltavskaia, to, krasnoarmieiskaya, russification, the, holodomor, of, 1932, 1933, and, other, tactics, used, by, the, union, government, led, to, a, catastrophic, fall, in, the, population, that, self, identified, as, being, ukrainian, in, the, kuban, official, soviet, union, statistics, of, 1959, state, that, ukrainians, made, up, 4, of, the, population, in, 1989, 3, the, self, identified, ukrainian, population, of, kuban, decreased, from, 915, 000, in, 1926, to, 150, 000, in, 1939, ethnic, minorities, in, kazakhstan, were, significantly, affected, by, the, kazakh, famine, of, 1930, 1933, in, addition, to, the, kazakhs, ukrainians, in, kazakhstan, had, the, second, highest, proportional, death, rate, after, the, kazakhs, themselves, between, the, 1926, and, 1937, censuses, ukrainian, population, in, kazakhstan, decreased, by, 36, from, 859, 396, to, 549, 859, mainly, from, famine, and, epidemics, but, also, including, emigration, while, uzbeks, uighurs, and, other, ethnic, minorities, in, kazakhstan, each, lost, between, 12, and, 30, of, their, populations, despite, attempts, by, the, soviet, authorities, to, hide, the, scale, of, the, disaster, it, became, known, abroad, thanks, to, the, publications, of, journalists, gareth, jones, malcolm, muggeridge, ewald, ammende, and, rhea, clyman, and, photographs, made, by, engineer, alexander, wienerberger, and, others, to, support, their, denial, of, the, famine, the, soviets, hosted, prominent, westerners, such, as, george, bernard, shaw, french, ex, prime, minister, douard, herriot, and, others, at, potemkin, villages, who, then, made, statements, that, they, had, not, seen, hunger, during, the, german, occupation, of, ukraine, the, occupation, authorities, allowed, the, publication, of, articles, in, local, newspapers, about, holodomor, and, other, communist, crimes, but, they, also, did, not, want, to, pay, too, much, attention, to, this, issue, in, order, to, avoid, stirring, national, sentiment, in, 1942, stepan, sosnovy, an, agronomist, in, kharkiv, published, a, comprehensive, statistical, research, on, the, number, of, holodomor, casualties, based, on, documents, from, soviet, archives, in, the, post, war, period, the, ukrainian, diaspora, disseminated, information, about, the, holodomor, in, europe, and, north, america, at, first, the, public, attitude, was, rather, cautious, as, the, information, came, from, people, who, had, lived, in, the, occupied, territories, but, it, gradually, changed, in, the, 1950s, scientific, study, of, the, holodomor, based, on, the, growing, number, of, memoirs, published, by, survivors, began, in, the, 1950s, the, soviet, union, long, denied, that, the, famine, had, taken, place, the, nkvd, and, later, kgb, controlled, the, archives, for, the, holodomor, period, and, made, relevant, records, available, very, slowly, the, exact, number, of, the, victims, remains, unknown, and, is, probably, impossible, to, estimate, even, within, a, margin, of, error, of, a, hundred, thousand, however, by, the, end, of, 1933, millions, of, people, had, starved, to, death, or, otherwise, died, unnaturally, in, the, soviet, republics, in, 2001, based, on, a, range, of, official, demographic, data, historian, stephen, g, wheatcroft, noted, that, official, death, statistics, for, this, period, were, systematically, repressed, and, showed, that, many, deaths, were, un, registered, estimates, vary, in, their, coverage, with, some, using, the, 1933, ukraine, borders, some, of, the, current, borders, and, some, counting, ethnic, ukrainians, some, extrapolate, on, the, basis, of, deaths, in, a, given, area, while, others, use, archival, data, some, historians, question, the, accuracy, of, soviet, censuses, as, they, may, reflect, soviet, propaganda, other, estimates, come, from, recorded, discussions, between, world, leaders, in, an, august, 1942, conversation, stalin, gave, winston, churchill, his, estimates, of, the, number, of, kulaks, who, were, repressed, for, resisting, collectivisation, as, 10, million, in, all, of, the, soviet, union, rather, than, only, in, ukraine, when, using, this, number, stalin, implied, that, it, included, not, only, those, who, lost, their, lives, but, also, those, who, were, forcibly, deported, there, are, variations, in, opinion, as, to, whether, deaths, in, gulag, labour, camps, should, be, counted, or, only, those, who, starved, to, death, at, home, estimates, before, archival, opening, varied, widely, such, as, 2, 5, million, volodymyr, kubiyovych, 4, 8, million, vasyl, hryshko, and, 5, million, robert, conquest, in, the, 1980s, dissident, demographer, and, historian, alexander, p, babyonyshev, writing, as, sergei, maksudov, estimated, officially, non, accounted, child, mortality, in, 1933, at, 150, 000, leading, to, a, calculation, that, the, number, of, births, for, 1933, should, be, increased, from, 471, 000, to, 621, 000, down, from, 1, 184, 000, in, 1927, given, the, decreasing, birth, rates, and, assuming, the, natural, mortality, rates, in, 1933, to, be, equal, to, the, average, annual, mortality, rate, in, 1927, 1930, 524, 000, per, year, a, natural, population, growth, for, 1933, would, have, been, 97, 000, as, opposed, to, the, recorded, decrease, of, 1, 379, 000, this, was, five, times, less, than, the, growth, in, the, previous, three, years, 1927, 1930, straight, line, extrapolation, of, population, continuation, of, the, previous, net, change, between, census, takings, in, 1927, and, 1936, would, have, been, 4, 043, million, which, compares, to, a, recorded, 538, 000, change, overall, change, in, birth, and, death, amounts, to, 4, 581, million, fewer, people, but, whether, through, factors, of, choice, disease, or, starvation, will, never, be, fully, known, in, the, 2000s, there, were, debates, among, historians, and, in, civil, society, about, the, number, of, deaths, as, soviet, files, were, released, and, tension, built, between, russia, and, the, ukrainian, president, viktor, yushchenko, yushchenko, and, other, ukrainian, politicians, described, fatalities, as, in, the, region, of, seven, to, ten, million, yushchenko, stated, in, a, speech, to, the, united, states, congress, that, the, holodomor, took, away, 20, million, lives, of, ukrainians, former, canadian, prime, minister, stephen, harper, issued, a, public, statement, giving, the, death, toll, at, about, 10, million, some, ukrainian, and, western, historians, use, similar, figures, david, r, marples, gave, a, figure, of, 7, 5, million, in, 2007, during, an, international, conference, held, in, ukraine, in, 2016, holodomor, 1932, 1933, loss, of, the, ukrainian, nation, at, the, national, university, of, kyiv, taras, shevchenko, it, was, claimed, that, during, the, holodomor, 7, million, ukrainians, were, killed, and, in, total, 10, million, people, died, of, starvation, across, the, ussr, however, the, use, of, the, 7, to, 20, million, figures, has, been, criticized, by, historians, timothy, d, snyder, and, stephen, g, wheatcroft, snyder, wrote, president, viktor, yushchenko, does, his, country, a, grave, disservice, by, claiming, ten, million, deaths, thus, exaggerating, the, number, of, ukrainians, killed, by, a, factor, of, three, but, it, is, true, that, the, famine, in, ukraine, of, 1932, 1933, was, a, result, of, purposeful, political, decisions, and, killed, about, three, million, people, in, an, email, to, postmedia, news, wheatcroft, wrote, i, find, it, regrettable, that, stephen, harper, and, other, leading, western, politicians, are, continuing, to, use, such, exaggerated, figures, for, ukrainian, famine, mortality, and, here, is, absolutely, no, basis, for, accepting, a, figure, of, 10, million, ukrainians, dying, as, a, result, of, the, famine, of, 1932, 1933, in, 2001, wheatcroft, had, calculated, total, population, loss, including, stillbirth, across, the, union, at, 10, million, and, possibly, up, to, 15, million, between, 1931, and, 1934, including, 2, 8, million, and, possibly, up, to, 4, 8, million, excess, deaths, and, 3, 7, million, up, to, 6, 7, million, population, losses, including, birth, losses, in, ukraine, in, 2002, ukrainian, historian, stanislav, kulchytsky, using, demographic, data, including, those, recently, unclassified, narrowed, the, losses, to, about, 3, 2, million, or, allowing, for, the, lack, of, precise, data, 3, million, to, 3, 5, million, the, number, of, recorded, excess, deaths, extracted, from, the, birth, death, statistics, from, soviet, archives, is, contradictory, the, data, fail, to, add, up, to, the, differences, between, the, results, of, the, 1926, census, and, the, 1937, census, kulchytsky, summarized, the, declassified, soviet, statistics, as, showing, a, decrease, of, 538, 000, people, in, the, population, of, soviet, ukraine, between, 1926, census, 28, 926, 000, and, 1937, census, 28, 388, 000, historians, estimate, a, quarter, of, the, death, toll, was, from, children, and, extrapolate, a, further, 600, 000, lost, births, similarly, wheatcroft, s, work, from, soviet, archives, showed, that, excess, deaths, in, ukraine, in, 1932, 1933, numbered, a, minimum, of, 1, 8, million, 2, 7, including, birth, losses, depending, upon, the, estimations, made, concerning, unregistered, mortality, and, natality, these, figures, could, be, increased, to, a, level, of, 2, 8, million, to, a, maximum, of, 4, 8, million, excess, deaths, and, to, 3, 7, million, to, a, maximum, of, 6, 7, million, population, losses, including, birth, losses, a, 2002, study, by, french, demographer, jacques, vallin, and, colleagues, utilising, some, similar, primary, sources, to, kulchytsky, and, performing, an, analysis, with, more, sophisticated, demographic, tools, with, forward, projection, of, expected, growth, from, the, 1926, census, and, backward, projection, from, the, 1939, census, estimates, the, number, of, direct, deaths, for, 1933, as, 2, 582, million, this, number, of, deaths, does, not, reflect, the, total, demographic, loss, for, ukraine, from, these, events, as, the, fall, of, the, birth, rate, during, the, crisis, and, the, out, migration, contribute, to, the, latter, as, well, the, total, population, shortfall, from, the, expected, value, between, 1926, and, 1939, estimated, by, vallin, amounted, to, 4, 566, million, of, this, number, 1, 057, million, is, attributed, to, the, birth, deficit, 930, 000, to, forced, out, migration, and, 2, 582, million, to, the, combination, of, excess, mortality, and, voluntary, out, migration, with, the, latter, assumed, to, be, negligible, this, estimate, gives, the, number, of, deaths, as, the, result, of, the, 1933, famine, about, 2, 2, million, according, to, demographic, studies, life, expectancy, which, had, been, in, the, high, forties, to, low, fifties, fell, sharply, for, those, born, in, 1932, to, 28, years, and, for, 1933, fell, further, to, the, extremely, low, 10, 8, years, for, females, and, 7, 3, years, for, males, it, remained, abnormally, low, for, 1934, but, as, commonly, expected, for, the, post, crisis, period, peaked, in, 1935, 36, according, to, historian, snyder, in, 2010, the, recorded, figure, of, excess, deaths, was, 2, 4, million, however, snyder, claims, that, this, figure, is, substantially, low, due, to, many, deaths, going, unrecorded, snyder, states, that, demographic, calculations, carried, out, by, the, ukrainian, government, provide, a, figure, of, 3, 89, million, dead, and, opined, that, the, actual, figure, is, likely, between, these, two, figures, approximately, 3, 3, million, deaths, to, starvation, and, disease, related, to, the, starvation, in, ukraine, from, 1932, to, 1933, snyder, also, estimates, that, of, the, million, people, who, died, in, the, russian, soviet, federative, socialist, republic, from, famine, at, the, same, time, approximately, 200, 000, were, ethnic, ukrainians, due, to, ukrainian, inhabited, regions, being, particularly, hard, hit, in, russia, as, a, child, mikhail, gorbachev, born, into, a, mixed, russian, ukrainian, family, experienced, the, famine, in, stavropol, krai, russia, he, recalled, in, a, memoir, that, in, that, terrible, year, nearly, half, the, population, of, my, native, village, privolnoye, starved, to, death, including, two, sisters, and, one, brother, of, my, father, wheatcroft, and, r, w, davies, concluded, that, disease, was, the, cause, of, a, large, number, of, deaths, in, 1932, 1933, there, were, 1, 2, million, cases, of, typhus, and, 500, 000, cases, of, typhoid, fever, malnourishment, increases, fatality, rates, from, many, diseases, and, are, not, counted, by, some, historians, from, 1932, to, 1934, the, largest, rate, of, increase, was, recorded, for, typhus, commonly, spread, by, lice, in, conditions, of, harvest, failure, and, increased, poverty, lice, are, likely, to, increase, gathering, numerous, refugees, at, railway, stations, on, trains, and, elsewhere, facilitates, the, spread, in, 1933, the, number, of, recorded, cases, was, 20, times, the, 1929, level, the, number, of, cases, per, head, of, population, recorded, in, ukraine, in, 1933, was, already, considerably, higher, than, in, the, ussr, as, a, whole, by, june, 1933, the, incidence, in, ukraine, had, increased, to, nearly, 10, times, the, january, level, and, it, was, much, higher, than, in, the, rest, of, the, ussr, estimates, of, the, human, losses, due, to, famine, must, account, for, the, numbers, involved, in, migration, including, forced, resettlement, according, to, soviet, statistics, the, migration, balance, for, the, population, in, ukraine, for, 1927, 1936, period, was, a, loss, of, 1, 343, million, people, even, when, the, data, were, collected, the, soviet, statistical, institutions, acknowledged, that, the, precision, was, less, than, for, the, data, of, the, natural, population, change, the, total, number, of, deaths, in, ukraine, due, to, unnatural, causes, for, the, given, ten, years, was, 3, 238, million, accounting, for, the, lack, of, precision, estimates, of, the, human, toll, range, from, 2, 2, million, to, 3, 5, million, deaths, according, to, babyonyshev, s, 1981, estimate, about, 81, 3, of, the, famine, victims, in, the, ukrainian, ssr, were, ethnic, ukrainians, 4, 5, russians, 1, 4, jews, and, 1, 1, were, poles, many, belarusians, volga, germans, and, other, nationalities, were, victims, as, well, the, ukrainian, rural, population, was, the, hardest, hit, by, the, holodomor, since, the, peasantry, constituted, a, demographic, backbone, of, the, ukrainian, nation, the, tragedy, deeply, affected, the, ukrainians, for, many, years, in, an, october, 2013, opinion, poll, in, ukraine, 38, 7, of, those, polled, stated, my, families, had, people, affected, by, the, famine, 39, 2, stated, they, did, not, have, such, relatives, and, 22, 1, did, not, know, scholars, continue, to, debate, whether, the, human, made, soviet, famine, was, a, central, act, in, a, campaign, of, genocide, or, a, tragic, byproduct, of, rapid, soviet, industrialization, and, the, collectivization, of, agriculture, whether, the, holodomor, is, a, genocide, is, a, significant, and, contentious, issue, in, modern, politics, a, number, of, governments, such, as, canada, have, recognized, the, holodomor, as, an, act, of, genocide, the, decision, was, criticized, by, david, r, marples, who, claimed, that, states, who, recognize, the, holodomor, as, a, genocide, are, motivated, by, emotion, or, on, pressure, by, local, and, international, groups, rather, than, hard, evidence, in, contrast, some, sources, argue, that, russian, influence, and, unwillingness, to, worsen, relations, with, russia, would, prevent, or, stall, the, recognition, of, holodomor, as, a, genocide, in, certain, regions, for, example, germany, scholarly, positions, are, diverse, raphael, lemkin, a, pioneer, of, genocide, studies, 35, who, coined, the, term, genocide, and, an, initiator, of, the, genocide, convention, called, the, famine, an, intentional, genocide, james, mace, and, norman, naimark, have, written, that, the, holodomor, was, a, genocide, and, the, intentional, result, of, soviet, policies, under, stalin, according, to, lemkin, ukraine, was, perhaps, the, classic, example, of, soviet, genocide, its, longest, and, broadest, experiment, in, russification, the, destruction, of, the, ukrainian, nation, lemkin, stated, that, because, ukrainians, were, very, sensitive, to, the, racial, murder, of, its, people, and, way, too, populous, the, soviet, regime, could, not, follow, a, pattern, of, total, extermination, as, in, the, holocaust, instead, the, genocidal, effort, consisted, of, four, steps, 1, extermination, of, the, ukrainian, national, elite, 2, liquidation, of, the, ukrainian, autocephalous, orthodox, church, 3, extermination, of, a, significant, part, of, the, ukrainian, peasantry, as, custodians, of, traditions, folklore, and, music, national, language, and, literature, and, 4, populating, the, territory, with, other, nationalities, with, intent, of, mixing, ukrainians, with, them, which, would, eventually, lead, to, the, dissolution, of, the, ukrainian, nation, because, of, these, four, factors, lemkin, considered, the, holodomor, an, attempt, to, destroy, the, whole, ukrainian, nation, not, just, the, ukrainian, peasantry, the, rediscovery, of, his, 1953, address, about, the, holodomor, has, influenced, holodomor, scholars, especially, his, view, of, genocide, as, a, complex, process, targeting, institutions, culture, and, economic, existence, of, a, group, and, not, necessarily, meaning, its, immediate, destruction, 35, stanislav, kulchytsky, who, also, recognizes, holodomor, as, genocide, believes, that, historians, should, approach, the, study, of, the, famine, with, realization, that, in, the, soviet, socialist, construction, appearance, belied, reality, and, that, the, real, intentions, of, some, ideas, and, policies, would, not, be, put, on, paper, he, nevertheless, believes, that, there, is, enough, evidence, that, proves, that, stalin, felt, hostility, and, distrust, towards, ukrainians, and, wanted, to, suppress, any, potential, disobedience, from, their, side, kulchytsky, bases, his, claims, among, other, things, on, stalin, s, telegrams, and, letters, sent, to, the, highest, ranked, officials, shortly, before, and, during, the, time, when, most, lethal, policies, were, applied, and, executed, in, ukraine, and, kuban, he, believes, that, while, the, famine, started, rather, as, a, result, of, collectivization, near, the, end, of, 1932, it, was, turned, into, an, instrument, of, intentional, starvation, of, millions, of, ukrainians, to, death, timothy, snyder, states, that, in, his, opinion, holodomor, meets, the, criteria, of, the, genocide, convention, he, does, however, refrains, from, using, the, term, and, prefers, the, term, mass, killing, instead, arguing, that, the, public, misinterprets, the, term, genocide, as, an, intention, to, murder, every, member, of, the, national, or, ethnic, group, something, that, the, armenian, genocide, and, holocaust, are, closer, to, than, any, other, cases, including, the, holodomor, 1, 30, 50, other, historians, such, as, michael, ellman, consider, the, holodomor, a, crime, against, humanity, but, do, not, classify, it, as, a, genocide, economist, steven, rosefielde, and, historian, robert, conquest, consider, the, death, toll, to, be, primarily, due, to, state, policy, and, poor, harvests, following, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, conquest, was, granted, access, to, the, soviet, state, archives, alongside, other, western, academics, in, 2004, wheatcroft, published, a, private, correspondence, that, he, had, with, conquest, in, the, exchange, conquest, wrote, that, he, is, now, of, the, opinion, that, the, holodomor, was, not, purposefully, inflicted, by, stalin, but, what, i, argue, is, that, with, resulting, famine, imminent, he, could, have, prevented, it, but, put, soviet, interest, other, than, feeding, the, starving, first, thus, consciously, abetting, it, in, an, interview, recorded, in, 2006, conquest, stated, the, holodomor, should, be, recognized, as, an, attack, on, the, ukrainian, people, and, discussed, problems, with, the, use, of, the, term, genocide, robert, davies, stephen, kotkin, stephen, wheatcroft, and, j, arch, getty, reject, the, notion, that, stalin, intentionally, wanted, to, kill, ukrainians, but, conclude, that, stalinist, policies, and, widespread, incompetence, among, government, officials, set, the, stage, for, famine, in, ukraine, and, other, soviet, republics, anne, applebaum, believes, that, the, famine, was, planned, to, undermine, ukrainian, identity, but, discusses, how, shifts, in, understanding, of, the, term, genocide, mean, that, it, is, more, difficult, to, apply, now, that, it, was, when, the, term, was, initially, conceived, another, argument, she, puts, forward, is, that, the, question, of, genocide, is, not, as, important, as, it, once, was, because, it, was, a, proxy, debate, about, ukraine, and, ukrainians, right, to, exist, a, right, which, no, longer, needs, historic, justification, in, 1991, american, historian, mark, tauger, considered, the, holodomor, primarily, the, result, of, natural, conditions, and, failed, economic, policy, not, intentional, state, policy, a, 2021, study, by, three, researches, including, nancy, qian, concluded, that, anti, ukrainian, bias, in, soviet, policy, explained, up, to, 92, of, famine, mortality, in, ukraine, scholars, consider, holodomor, denial, to, be, the, assertion, that, the, 1932, 1933, famine, in, soviet, ukraine, did, not, occur, denying, the, existence, of, the, famine, was, the, soviet, state, s, position, and, reflected, in, both, soviet, propaganda, and, the, work, of, some, western, journalists, and, intellectuals, including, george, bernard, shaw, walter, duranty, and, louis, fischer, in, britain, and, the, united, states, eye, witness, accounts, by, welsh, freelance, journalist, gareth, jones, and, by, the, american, communist, fred, beal, were, met, with, widespread, disbelief, in, the, soviet, union, any, discussion, of, the, famine, was, banned, entirely, ukrainian, historian, stanislav, kulchytsky, stated, the, soviet, government, ordered, him, to, falsify, his, findings, and, depict, the, famine, as, an, unavoidable, natural, disaster, to, absolve, the, communist, party, and, uphold, the, legacy, of, stalin, the, event, is, considered, a, genocide, by, ukraine, and, the, european, parliament, and, the, lower, house, of, parliament, of, russia, condemned, the, soviet, regime, that, has, neglected, the, lives, of, people, for, the, achievement, of, economic, and, political, goals, on, 10, november, 2003, at, the, united, nations, 25, countries, including, russia, ukraine, and, united, states, signed, a, joint, statement, on, the, seventieth, anniversary, of, the, holodomor, with, the, following, preamble, in, the, former, soviet, union, millions, of, men, women, and, children, fell, victims, to, the, cruel, actions, and, policies, of, the, totalitarian, regime, the, great, famine, of, 1932, 1933, in, ukraine, holodomor, took, from, 7, million, to, 10, million, innocent, lives, and, became, a, national, tragedy, for, the, ukrainian, people, in, this, regard, we, note, activities, in, observance, of, the, seventieth, anniversary, of, this, famine, in, particular, organized, by, the, government, of, ukraine, honouring, the, seventieth, anniversary, of, the, ukrainian, tragedy, we, also, commemorate, the, memory, of, millions, of, russians, kazakhs, and, representatives, of, other, nationalities, who, died, of, starvation, in, the, volga, river, region, northern, caucasus, kazakhstan, and, in, other, parts, of, the, former, soviet, union, as, a, result, of, civil, war, and, forced, collectivisation, leaving, deep, scars, in, the, consciousness, of, future, generations, in, 1984, the, united, states, congress, established, the, u, s, commission, on, the, ukraine, famine, which, compiled, its, 1988, report, to, congress, in, the, report, the, us, government, concludes, with, anecdotal, evidence, that, the, soviets, had, purposely, prevented, ukrainians, from, leaving, famine, struck, regions, this, was, corroborated, following, the, discovery, of, stalin, s, letter, to, molotov, titled, preventing, the, mass, exodus, of, peasants, who, are, starving, restricting, travel, by, peasants, after, in, the, kuban, and, ukraine, a, massive, outflow, of, peasants, for, bread, has, begun, that, like, the, outflow, from, ukraine, last, year, was, organized, by, the, enemies, of, soviet, power, the, commission, published, the, earlier, mentioned, letter, written, by, stalin, to, lazar, kaganovich, on, 11, september, 1932, the, ukrainian, parliament, first, recognized, the, holodomor, as, a, genocide, in, 2003, and, criminalized, both, holodomor, denial, and, holocaust, denial, in, 2006, in, 2010, the, kyiv, court, of, appeal, ruled, that, the, holodomor, was, an, act, of, genocide, and, held, joseph, stalin, vyacheslav, molotov, lazar, kaganovich, stanislav, kosior, pavel, postyshev, mendel, khatayevich, vlas, chubar, and, other, bolshevik, leaders, responsible, the, holodomor, has, been, compared, to, the, irish, famine, of, 1845, 1849, that, took, place, in, ireland, under, british, rule, which, has, been, the, subject, of, similar, controversy, and, debate, russia, s, war, strategy, in, the, war, against, ukraine, in, 2022, has, drawn, parallels, with, the, holodomor, for, the, intentional, impediment, of, relief, supplies, to, civilians, the, blockade, of, ukrainian, ports, that, threatened, to, cause, famine, in, other, countries, and, the, deliberate, targeting, of, civilian, infrastructure, to, deprive, ukrainians, of, the, necessities, of, life, as, of, early, may, 2022, ukraine, s, defense, ministry, claims, that, russian, forces, have, plundered, at, least, 500, 000,

experts, after, campaigns, from, the, ukrainian, ministry, of, foreign, affairs, for, the, recognition, of, the, holodomor, as, a, genocide, parliaments, and, governments, of, various, countries,
