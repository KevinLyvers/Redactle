the, extremities, of, their, world, in, the, iberian, peninsula, and, the, caucasus, due, to, the, mythical, wealth, associated, with, them, tartessos, and, the, golden, fleece, of, colchis, in, earliest, times, the, area, of, caucasian, iberia, was, inhabited, by, several, related, tribes, stemming, from, the, kura, araxes, culture, according, to, the, cyril, toumanoff, moschians, were, the, early, proto, georgian, tribe, which, played, a, leading, role, in, the, consolidation, of, iberian, tribes, largely, inhabiting, eastern, and, southern, georgia, the, moschians, may, have, moved, slowly, to, the, northeast, forming, settlements, as, they, traveled, one, of, these, was, mtskheta, the, future, capital, of, the, kingdom, of, iberia, the, mtskheta, tribe, was, later, ruled, by, a, prince, locally, known, as, mamasakhlisi, father, of, the, household, in, georgian, the, written, sources, for, the, early, periods, of, iberia, s, history, are, mostly, medieval, georgian, chronicles, that, modern, scholarship, interpret, as, a, semi, legendary, narrative, one, such, chronicle, moktsevay, kartlisay, conversion, of, kartli, mentions, that, a, ruler, named, azo, and, his, people, came, from, arian, kartli, the, initial, home, of, the, proto, iberians, which, had, been, under, achaemenid, rule, until, the, fall, of, the, persian, empire, and, settled, on, the, site, where, mtskheta, was, to, be, founded, another, georgian, chronicle, kartlis, tskhovreba, history, of, kartli, claims, azo, to, be, an, officer, of, alexander, s, who, massacred, a, local, ruling, family, and, conquered, the, area, until, being, defeated, at, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, bc, by, prince, pharnavaz, at, that, time, a, local, chief, the, story, of, alexander, s, invasion, of, kartli, although, legendary, nevertheless, reflects, the, establishment, of, georgian, monarchy, in, the, hellenistic, period, and, the, desire, of, later, georgian, literati, to, connect, this,

the, caucasus, with, the, daryal, also, known, as, the, iberian, gates, being, the, most, important, of, them, the, period, following, this, time, of, prosperity, was, one, of, incessant, warfare, as, iberia, was, forced, to, defend, against, numerous, invasions, into, its, territories, some, southern, parts, of, iberia, that, were, conquered, from, the, kingdom, of, armenia, in, the, 2nd, century,

ii, were, strained, though, hadrian, is, said, to, have, sought, to, appease, pharsman, however, it, was, only, under, hadrian, s, successor, antoninus, pius, that, relations, improved, to, the, extent, that, pharsman, is, said, to, have, even, visited, rome, where, dio, cassius, reports, that, a, statue, was, erected, in, his, honor, and, that, rights, to, sacrifice, were, given, the,

local, cults, within, georgian, mythology, especially, the, cult, of, the, sun, gradually, came, to, merge, with, ancient, georgian, beliefs, it, is, even, thought, that, mithras, must, have, been,

countries, seem, to, have, been, friendly, at, first, as, iberia, cooperated, in, persian, campaigns, against, rome, and, the, iberian, king, amazasp, iii, 260, 265, was, listed, as, a, high, dignitary, of, the, sasanian, realm, not, a, vassal, who, had, been, subdued, by, force, of, arms, but, the, aggressive, tendencies, of, the, sasanians, were, evident, in, their, propagation, of, zoroastrianism, which, was, probably, established, in, iberia, between, the, 260s, and, 290s, however, in, the, peace, of, nisibis, 298, while, the, roman, empire, obtained, control, of, caucasian, iberia, again, as, a, vassal, state, and, acknowledged, the, reign, over, all, the, caucasian, area, it, recognized, mirian, iii, the, first, of, the, chosroid, dynasty, as, king, of, iberia, roman,

the, event, is, related, with, the, mission, of, a, cappadocian, woman, saint, nino, who, since, 303, had, preached, orthodoxy, in, the, georgian, kingdom, of, iberia, eastern, georgia, the, religion, would, become, a, strong, tie, between, georgia, and, rome, later, byzantium, and, have, a, large, scale, impact, on, the, state, s, culture, and, society, iranian, elements, in, georgian, art, gradually, ceased, with, the, adoptation, of, eastern, orthodoxy, in, the, fourth, century, however, after, the, emperor, julian, was, slain, during, his, failed, campaign, in, persia, in, 363, rome, ceded, control, of, iberia, to, persia, and, king, varaz, bakur, i, asphagur, 363, 365, became, a, persian, vassal, an, outcome, confirmed, by, the, peace, of, acilisene, in, 387, however, a, later, ruler, of, kartli, pharsman, iv, 406, 409, preserved, his, country, s, autonomy, and, ceased, to, pay, tribute, to, persia, persia, prevailed, and, sassanian, kings, began, to, appoint, a, viceroy,

and, southern, georgian, lands, under, his, control, he, established, an, autocephalic, patriarchate, at, mtskheta, and, made, tbilisi, his, capital, in, 482, he, led, a, general, uprising, against, persia, and, started, a, desperate, war, for, independence, that, lasted, for, twenty, years, he, could, not, get, byzantine, support, and, was, eventually, defeated, dying, in, battle, in, 502, the, continuing, rivalry, between, byzantium, and, sasanian, persia, for, supremacy, in, the, caucasus, and, the, next, unsuccessful, insurrection, 523, of, the, georgians, under, gurgen, had, severe,

emperor, maurice, to, revive, the, kingdom, of, iberia, in, 582, but, in, 591, byzantium, and, persia, agreed, to, divide, iberia, between, them, with, tbilisi, to, be, in, persian, hands, and, mtskheta, to, be, under, byzantine, control, at, the, beginning, of, the, 7th, century, the, truce, between, byzantium, and, persia, collapsed, the, iberian, prince, stephan, i, c, 590, 627, decided, in, 607, to, join, forces, with, persia, in, order, to, reunite, all, the, territories, of, iberia, a, goal, he, seems, to, have, accomplished, but, emperor, heraclius, s, offensive, in, 627, and, 628, brought, victory, over, the, georgians, and, persians, and, ensured, byzantine, predominance, in, western, and, eastern, georgia, until, the, invasion, of, the, caucasus, by, the, arabs, the, arabs, reached, iberia, about, 645, and, forced, its, eristavi, prince, stephanoz, ii, 637, c, 650, to, abandon, his, allegiance, to, byzantium, and, recognize, the, caliph, as, his, suzerain, iberia, thus, became, a, tributary, state, and, an, arab, emir, was, installed, in, tbilisi, about, 653, at, the, beginning, of, the, 9th, century, eristavi, ashot, i, 813, 830, of, the, new, bagrationi,

brought, the, various, principalities, together, to, form, a, united, georgian, monarchy, the, similarity, of, the, name, with, the, old, inhabitants, of, the, iberian, peninsula, the, western, iberians, has, led, to, an, idea, of, ethnogenetical, kinship, between, them, and, the, people, of, caucasian, iberia, called, the, eastern, iberians, it, has, been, advocated, by, various, ancient, and, medieval, authors, although, they, differed, in, approach, to, the, problem, of, the, initial, place, of, their, origin, the, theory, seems, to, have, been, popular, in, medieval, georgia, the, prominent, georgian, religious, writer, george, the, hagiorite, 1009, 1065, wrote, about, the, wish, of, certain, georgian, nobles, to, travel, to, the, iberian, peninsula, and, visit, the, local,
