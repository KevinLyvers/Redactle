the, early, modern, period, is, a, historical, period, that, is, part, of, or, depending, on, the, historian, immediately, preceded, the, modern, period, with, divisions, based, primarily, on, the, history, of, europe, and, the, broader, concept, of, modernity, there, is, no, exact, date, that, marks, the, beginning, or, end, of, the, period, and, its, extent, may, vary, depending, on, the, area, of, history, being, studied, in, general, the, early, modern, period, is, considered, to, have, lasted, from, around, the, start, of, the, 16th, century, to, the, start, of, the, 19th, century, about, 1500, 1800, in, a, european, context, it, is, defined, as, the, period, following, the, middle, ages, and, preceding, the, advent, of, modernity, but, the, dates, of, these, boundaries, are, far, from, universally, agreed, in, the, context, of, global, history, the, early, modern, period, is, often, used, even, in, contexts, where, there, is, no, equivalent, medieval, period, various, events, and, historical, transitions, have, been, proposed, as, the, start, of, the, early, modern, period, including, the, fall, of, constantinople, in, 1453, the, start, of, the, renaissance, the, end, of, the, crusades, and, the, beginning, of, the, age, of, discovery, its, end, is, often, marked, by, the, french, revolution, and, sometimes, also, the, american, revolution, or, napoleon, s, rise, to, power, historians, in, recent, decades, have, argued, that, from, a, worldwide, standpoint, the, most, important, feature, of, the, early, modern, period, was, its, spreading, globalizing, character, new, economies, and, institutions, emerged, becoming, more, sophisticated, and, globally, articulated, over, the, course, of, the, period, the, early, modern, period, also, included, the, rise, of, the, dominance, of, mercantilism, as, an, economic, theory, other, notable, trends, of, the, period, include, the, development, of, experimental, science, increasingly, rapid, technological, progress, secularized, civic, politics, accelerated, travel, due, to, improvements, in, mapping, and, ship, design, and, the, emergence, of, nation, states, the, early, modern, period, is, a, subdivision, of, the, most, recent, of, the, three, major, periods, of, european, history, antiquity, the, middle, ages, and, the, modern, period, the, term, early, modern, was, first, proposed, by, medieval, historian, lynn, thorndike, in, his, 1926, work, a, short, history, of, civilization, as, a, broader, alternative, to, the, renaissance, it, was, first, picked, up, within, the, field, of, economic, history, during, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, and, gradually, spread, to, other, historians, in, the, following, decades, and, became, widely, known, among, scholars, during, the, 1990s, at, the, onset, of, the, early, modern, period, trends, in, various, regions, of, the, world, represented, a, shift, away, from, medieval, modes, of, organization, politically, and, economically, feudalism, declined, in, europe, and, christendom, saw, the, end, of, the, crusades, and, of, religious, unity, in, western, europe, under, the, roman, catholic, church, the, old, order, was, destabilized, by, the, protestant, reformation, which, caused, a, backlash, that, expanded, the, inquisition, and, sparked, the, disastrous, european, wars, of, religion, which, included, the, especially, bloody, thirty, years, war, and, ended, with, the, establishment, of, the, modern, international, system, in, the, peace, of, westphalia, along, with, the, european, colonization, of, the, americas, this, period, also, contained, the, commercial, revolution, and, the, golden, age, of, piracy, the, globalization, of, the, period, can, be, seen, in, the, medieval, north, italian, city, states, and, maritime, republics, particularly, genoa, venice, and, milan, russia, reached, the, pacific, coast, in, 1647, and, consolidated, its, control, over, the, russian, far, east, in, the, 19th, century, the, great, divergence, took, place, as, western, europe, greatly, surpassed, china, in, technology, and, per, capita, wealth, as, the, age, of, revolution, dawned, beginning, with, revolts, in, america, and, france, political, changes, were, then, pushed, forward, in, other, countries, partly, as, a, result, of, upheavals, of, the, napoleonic, wars, and, their, impact, on, thought, and, thinking, from, concepts, from, nationalism, to, organizing, armies, the, early, period, ended, in, a, time, of, political, and, economic, change, as, a, result, of, mechanization, in, society, the, american, revolution, and, the, first, french, revolution, other, factors, included, the, redrawing, of, the, map, of, europe, by, the, final, act, of, the, congress, of, vienna, and, the, peace, established, by, the, second, treaty, of, paris, which, ended, the, napoleonic, wars, in, the, americas, pre, columbian, peoples, had, built, a, large, and, varied, civilization, including, the, aztec, empire, the, inca, civilization, the, maya, civilization, and, its, cities, and, the, muisca, the, european, colonization, of, the, americas, began, during, the, early, modern, period, as, did, the, establishment, of, european, trading, hubs, in, asia, and, africa, which, contributed, to, the, spread, of, christianity, around, the, world, the, rise, of, sustained, contacts, between, previously, isolated, parts, of, the, globe, in, particular, the, columbian, exchange, that, linked, the, old, world, and, the, new, world, greatly, altered, the, human, environment, notably, the, atlantic, slave, trade, and, colonization, of, native, americans, began, during, this, period, the, ottoman, empire, conquered, southeastern, europe, and, parts, of, west, asia, and, north, africa, in, the, islamic, world, after, the, fall, of, the, timurid, renaissance, powers, such, as, the, ottoman, suri, safavid, and, mughal, empires, grew, in, strength, three, of, which, are, known, as, gunpowder, empires, for, the, military, technology, that, enabled, them, particularly, in, the, indian, subcontinent, mughal, architecture, culture, and, art, reached, their, zenith, while, the, empire, itself, is, believed, to, have, had, the, world, s, largest, economy, bigger, than, the, entirety, of, western, europe, and, worth, 25, of, global, gdp, by, the, mid, 18th, century, india, was, a, major, proto, industrializing, region, various, chinese, dynasties, controlled, the, east, asian, sphere, in, japan, the, edo, period, from, 1600, to, 1868, is, also, referred, to, as, the, early, modern, period, in, korea, the, early, modern, period, is, considered, to, have, lasted, from, the, rise, of, the, joseon, dynasty, to, the, enthronement, of, king, gojong, by, the, 16th, century, asian, economies, under, the, ming, dynasty, and, mughal, bengal, were, stimulated, by, trade, with, the, portuguese, the, spanish, and, the, dutch, while, japan, engaged, in, the, nanban, trade, after, the, arrival, of, the, first, european, portuguese, during, the, azuchi, momoyama, period, meanwhile, in, southeast, asia, the, toungoo, empire, along, with, ayutthaya, experienced, a, golden, age, and, ruled, a, large, extent, of, mainland, southeast, asia, with, the, nguyen, and, trinh, lords, de, facto, ruling, the, south, and, north, of, present, day, vietnam, respectively, whereas, the, mataram, sultanate, was, the, dominant, power, in, maritime, southeast, asia, the, early, modern, period, experienced, an, influx, of, european, traders, and, missionaries, into, the, region, in, early, modern, times, the, major, nations, of, east, asia, attempted, to, pursue, a, course, of, isolationism, from, the, outside, world, but, this, policy, was, not, always, enforced, uniformly, or, successfully, however, by, the, end, of, the, early, modern, period, china, korea, and, japan, were, mostly, closed, and, uninterested, in, europeans, even, while, trading, relationships, grew, in, port, cities, such, as, guangzhou, and, dejima, around, the, beginning, of, the, ethnically, han, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, china, was, leading, the, world, in, mathematics, as, well, as, science, however, europe, soon, caught, up, to, china, s, scientific, and, mathematical, achievements, and, surpassed, them, many, scholars, have, speculated, about, the, reason, behind, china, s, lag, in, advancement, a, historian, named, colin, ronan, claims, that, though, there, is, no, one, specific, answer, there, must, be, a, connection, between, china, s, urgency, for, new, discoveries, being, weaker, than, europe, s, and, china, s, inability, to, capitalize, on, its, early, advantages, ronan, believes, that, china, s, confucian, bureaucracy, and, traditions, led, to, china, not, having, a, scientific, revolution, which, led, china, to, have, fewer, scientists, to, break, the, existing, orthodoxies, like, galileo, galilei, despite, inventing, gunpowder, in, the, 9th, century, it, was, in, europe, that, the, classic, handheld, firearms, matchlocks, were, invented, with, evidence, of, use, around, the, 1480s, china, was, using, the, matchlocks, by, 1540, after, the, portuguese, brought, their, matchlocks, to, japan, in, the, early, 1500s, china, during, the, ming, dynasty, established, a, bureau, to, maintain, its, calendar, the, bureau, was, necessary, because, the, calendars, were, linked, to, celestial, phenomena, and, that, needs, regular, maintenance, because, twelve, lunar, months, have, 344, or, 355, days, so, occasional, leap, months, have, to, be, added, in, order, to, maintain, 365, days, per, year, in, the, early, ming, dynasty, urbanization, increased, as, the, population, grew, and, as, the, division, of, labor, grew, more, complex, large, urban, centers, such, as, nanjing, and, beijing, also, contributed, to, the, growth, of, private, industry, in, particular, small, scale, industries, grew, up, often, specializing, in, paper, silk, cotton, and, porcelain, goods, for, the, most, part, however, relatively, small, urban, centers, with, markets, proliferated, around, the, country, town, markets, mainly, traded, food, with, some, necessary, manufactures, such, as, pins, or, oil, in, the, 16th, century, the, ming, dynasty, flourished, over, maritime, trade, with, the, portuguese, spanish, and, dutch, empires, the, trade, brought, in, a, massive, amount, of, silver, which, china, at, the, time, needed, desperately, prior, to, china, s, global, trade, its, economy, ran, on, paper, money, however, in, the, 14th, century, china, s, paper, money, system, suffered, a, crisis, and, by, the, mid, 15th, century, crashed, the, silver, imports, helped, fill, the, void, left, by, the, broken, paper, money, system, which, helps, explain, why, the, value, of, silver, in, china, was, twice, as, high, as, the, value, of, silver, in, spain, during, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, china, under, the, later, ming, dynasty, became, isolated, prohibiting, the, construction, of, ocean, going, sea, vessels, despite, isolationist, policies, the, ming, economy, still, suffered, from, an, inflation, due, to, an, overabundance, of, spanish, new, world, silver, entering, its, economy, through, new, european, colonies, such, as, macau, ming, china, was, further, strained, by, victorious, but, costly, wars, to, protect, korea, from, japanese, invasion, the, european, trade, depression, of, the, 1620s, also, hurt, the, chinese, economy, which, sunk, to, the, point, where, all, of, china, s, trading, partners, cut, ties, with, them, philip, iv, restricted, shipments, of, exports, from, acapulco, the, japanese, cut, off, all, trade, with, macau, and, the, dutch, severed, connections, between, goa, and, macau, the, damage, to, the, economy, was, compounded, by, the, effects, on, agriculture, of, the, incipient, little, ice, age, natural, calamities, crop, failure, and, sudden, epidemics, the, ensuing, breakdown, of, authority, and, people, s, livelihoods, allowed, rebel, leaders, such, as, li, zicheng, to, challenge, ming, authority, the, ming, dynasty, fell, around, 1644, to, the, ethnically, manchu, qing, dynasty, which, would, be, the, last, dynasty, of, china, the, qing, ruled, from, 1644, to, 1912, with, a, brief, abortive, restoration, in, 1917, during, its, reign, the, qing, dynasty, adopted, many, of, the, outward, features, of, chinese, culture, in, establishing, its, rule, but, did, not, necessarily, assimilate, instead, adopting, a, more, universalist, style, of, governance, the, manchus, were, formerly, known, as, the, jurchens, when, beijing, was, captured, by, li, zicheng, s, peasant, rebels, in, 1644, the, chongzhen, emperor, the, last, ming, emperor, committed, suicide, the, manchus, then, allied, with, former, ming, general, wu, sangui, and, seized, control, of, beijing, which, became, the, new, capital, of, the, qing, dynasty, the, manchus, adopted, the, confucian, norms, of, traditional, chinese, government, in, their, rule, of, china, proper, schoppa, the, editor, of, the, columbia, guide, to, modern, chinese, history, argues, a, date, around, 1780, as, the, beginning, of, modern, china, is, thus, closer, to, what, we, know, today, as, historical, reality, it, also, allows, us, to, have, a, better, baseline, to, understand, the, precipitous, decline, of, the, chinese, polity, in, the, nineteenth, and, twentieth, centuries, the, sengoku, period, that, began, around, 1467, and, lasted, around, a, century, consisted, of, several, continually, warring, states, following, contact, with, the, portuguese, on, tanegashima, isle, in, 1543, the, japanese, adopted, several, of, the, technologies, and, cultural, practices, of, their, visitors, whether, in, the, military, area, the, arquebus, european, style, cuirasses, european, ships, religion, christianity, decorative, art, language, integration, to, japanese, of, a, western, vocabulary, and, culinary, the, portuguese, introduced, tempura, and, valuable, refined, sugar, central, government, was, largely, reestablished, by, oda, nobunaga, and, toyotomi, hideyoshi, during, the, azuchi, momoyama, period, although, a, start, date, of, 1573, is, often, given, in, more, broad, terms, the, period, begins, with, oda, nobunaga, s, entry, into, kyoto, in, 1568, when, he, led, his, army, to, the, imperial, capital, in, order, to, install, ashikaga, yoshiaki, as, the, 15th, and, ultimately, final, sh, gun, of, the, ashikaga, shogunate, and, it, lasts, until, the, coming, to, power, of, tokugawa, ieyasu, after, his, victory, over, supporters, of, the, toyotomi, clan, at, the, battle, of, sekigahara, in, 1600, tokugawa, received, the, title, of, sh, gun, in, 1603, establishing, the, tokugawa, shogunate, the, edo, period, from, 1600, to, 1868, characterized, early, modern, japan, the, tokugawa, shogunate, was, a, feudalist, regime, of, japan, established, by, tokugawa, ieyasu, and, ruled, by, the, sh, guns, of, the, tokugawa, clan, the, period, gets, its, name, from, the, capital, city, edo, now, called, tokyo, the, tokugawa, shogunate, ruled, from, edo, castle, from, 1603, until, 1868, when, it, was, abolished, during, the, meiji, restoration, in, the, late, edo, period, often, called, the, late, tokugawa, shogunate, society, in, the, japanese, tokugawa, period, edo, society, unlike, the, shogunates, before, it, was, based, on, the, strict, class, hierarchy, originally, established, by, toyotomi, hideyoshi, the, daimy, s, feudal, lords, were, at, the, top, followed, by, the, warrior, caste, of, samurai, with, the, farmers, artisans, and, traders, ranking, below, the, country, was, strictly, closed, to, foreigners, with, few, exceptions, with, the, sakoku, policy, literacy, among, the, japanese, people, rose, in, the, two, centuries, of, isolation, in, some, parts, of, the, country, particularly, smaller, regions, daimy, s, and, samurai, were, more, or, less, identical, since, daimy, s, might, be, trained, as, samurai, and, samurai, might, act, as, local, lords, otherwise, the, largely, inflexible, nature, of, this, social, stratification, system, unleashed, disruptive, forces, over, time, taxes, on, the, peasantry, were, set, at, fixed, amounts, which, did, not, account, for, inflation, or, other, changes, in, monetary, value, as, a, result, the, tax, revenues, collected, by, the, samurai, landowners, were, worth, less, and, less, over, time, this, often, led, to, numerous, confrontations, between, noble, but, impoverished, samurai, and, well, to, do, peasants, none, however, proved, compelling, enough, to, seriously, challenge, the, established, order, until, the, arrival, of, foreign, powers, in, 1392, general, yi, seong, gye, established, the, joseon, dynasty, 1392, 1910, with, a, largely, bloodless, coup, yi, seong, gye, moved, the, capital, of, korea, to, the, location, of, modern, day, seoul, the, dynasty,

kings, in, korea, s, history, to, earn, the, title, of, great, in, their, posthumous, titles, reclaimed, korean, territory, to, the, north, and, created, the, korean, alphabet, during, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, korea, was, invaded, twice, by, japan, first, in, 1592, and, again, in, 1597, japan, failed, both, times, due, to, admiral, yi, sun, sin, korea, s, revered, naval, genius, who, led, the, korean, navy, using, advanced, metal, clad, ships, called, turtle, ships, because, the, ships, were, armed, with, cannons, admiral, yi, s, navy, was, able, to, demolish, the, japanese, invading, fleets, destroying, hundreds, of, ships, in, japan, s, second, invasion, during, the, 17th, century, korea, was, invaded, again, this, time, by, manchurians, who, would, later, take, over,

dominant, power, in, india, from, 1740, and, expanding, rapid, until, the, third, battle, of, panipat, halted, their, expansion, in, 1761, the, development, of, new, imperialism, saw, the, conquest, of, nearly, all, eastern, hemisphere, territories, by, colonial, powers, the, commercial, colonization, of, india, commenced, in, 1757, after, the, battle, of, plassey, when, the, nawab, of, bengal,

spread, northward, to, france, germany, holland, and, england, where, it, became, associated, with, the, reformation, developing, during, the, enlightenment, era, renaissance, humanism, as, an, intellectual, movement, spread, across, europe, the, basic, training, of, the, humanist, was, to, speak, well, and, write, typically, in, the, form, of, a, letter, the, term, umanista, comes, from, the, latter, part, of, the, 15th, century, the, people, were, associated, with, the, studia, humanitatis, a, novel, curriculum, that, was, competing, with, the, quadrivium, and, scholastic, logic, in, france, pre, eminent, humanist, guillaume, bud, 1467, 1540, applied, the, philological, methods, of, italian, humanism, to, the, study, of, antique, coinage, and, to, legal, history, composing, a, detailed, commentary, on, justinian, s, code, although, a, royal, absolutist, and, not, a, republican, like, the, early, italian, umanisti, bud, was, active, in, civic, life, serving, as, a, diplomat, for, francis, i, and, helping, to, found, the, coll, ge, des, lecteurs, royaux, later, the, coll, ge, de, france, meanwhile, marguerite, de, navarre, the, sister, of, francis, i, herself, a, poet, novelist, and, religious, mystic, gathered, around, her, and, protected, a, circle, of, vernacular, poets, and, writers, including, cl, ment, marot, pierre, de, ronsard, and, fran, ois, rabelais, during, the, early, modern, period, thorough, and, accurate, global, data, on, mortality, rates, is, limited, for, a, number, of, reasons, including, disparities, in, medical, practices, and, views, on, the, dead, however, there, still, remains, data, from, european, countries, that, still, holds, valuable, information, on, the, mortality, rates, of, infants, during, this, era, in, his, book, life, under, pressure, mortality, and, living, standards, in, europe, and, asia, 1700, 1900, tommy, bengtsson, provides, adequate, information, pertaining, to, the, data, of, infant, mortality, rates, in, european, countries, as, well, as, provide, necessary, contextual, influences, on, these, mortality, rates, infant, mortality, was, a, global, concern, during, the, early, modern, period, as, many, newborns, would, not, survive, into, childhood, bengsston, provides, comparative, data, on, infant, mortality, averages, in, a, variety, of, european, towns, cities, regions, and, countries, starting, from, the, mid, 1600s, to, the, 1800s, these, statistics, are, measured, for, infant, deaths, within, the, first, month, of, every, 1, 000, births, in, a, given, area, for, instance, the, average, infant, mortality, rate, in, what, is, now, germany, was, 108, infant, deaths, for, every, 1, 000, births, in, bavaria, there, were, 140, 190, infant, deaths, reported, for, every, 1, 000, births, in, france, beauvaisis, reported, 140, 160, infants, dying, per, every, 1, 000, babies, born, in, what, is, now, italy, venice, averaged, 134, infant, deaths, per, 1, 000, births, in, geneva, 80, 110, infants, died, per, every, 1, 000, babies, born, in, sweden, 70, 95, infants, died, per, 1, 000, births, in, link, ping, 48, infants, died, per, 1, 000, births, in, sundsvall, and, 41, infants, died, per, 1, 000, births, in, vastanfors, bengsston, writes, that, climate, conditions, were, the, most, important, factor, in, determining, infant, mortality, rates, for, the, period, from, birth, to, the, fifth, birthday, is, clearly, the, most, important, determinant, of, death, winters, proved, to, be, harsh, on, families, and, their, newborns, especially, if, the, other, seasons, of, the, year, were, warmer, this, seasonal, drop, in, temperature, was, a, lot, for, an, infant, s, body, to, adapt, to, for, instance, italy, is, home, to, a, very, warm, climate, in, the, summer, and, the, temperature, drops, immensely, in, the, winter, this, lends, context, to, bengsston, writing, that, the, winter, peak, was, the, cruelest, during, the, first, 10, days, of, life, a, newborn, was, four, times, more, likely, to, die, than, in, the, summer, according, to, bengsston, this, trend, existed, amongst, cities, in, different, parts, of, italy, and, in, various, parts, of, europe, even, though, cities, operated, under, different, economic, and, agricultural, conditions, this, leads, bengsston, to, his, conclusion, on, what, may, have, caused, mortality, rates, in, infants, to, spike, during, winter, the, strong, protective, effect, of, summer, for, neonatal, deaths, leads, us, to, suppose, that, in, many, cases, these, might, be, due, to, the, insufficient, heating, systems, of, the, houses, or, to, the, exposure, of, the, newborn, to, cold, during, the, baptism, ceremony, this, last, hypothesis, could, explain, why, the, effect, was, so, strong, in, italy, during, the, early, modern, period, many, societies, views, on, death, changed, greatly, with, the, implementation, of, new, torture, techniques, and, increased, public, executions, people, began, to, give, more, value, to, their, life, and, their, body, after, death, along, with, the, views, on, death, methods, of, execution, also, changed, new, devices, to, torture, and, execute, criminals, were, invented, the, number, of, criminals, executed, by, gibbeting, increased, as, did, the, total, rate, of, executions, during, the, early, modern, period
