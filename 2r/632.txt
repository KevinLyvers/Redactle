pompeii, was, a, city, in, what, is, now, the, municipality, of, pompei, near, naples, in, the, campania, region, of, italy, along, with, herculaneum, stabiae, and, many, surrounding, villas, the, city, was, buried, under, 4, to, 6, m, 13, to, 20, ft, of, volcanic, ash, and, pumice, in, the, eruption, of, mount, vesuvius, in, 79, ad, largely, preserved, under, the, ash, pompeii, offers, a, unique, snapshot, of, roman, life, frozen, at, the, moment, it, was, buried, as, well, as, insight, into, ancient, urban, planning, it, was, a, wealthy, town, of, 10, 000, to, 20, 000, residents, at, the, time, it, was, destroyed, it, hosted, many, fine, public, buildings, and, luxurious, private, houses, with, lavish, decorations, furnishings, and, artworks, which, were, the, main, attractions, for, early, excavators, subsequent, excavations, have, found, hundreds, of, private, homes, and, businesses, reflecting, various, architectural, styles, and, social, classes, as, well, as, numerous, public, buildings, organic, remains, including, wooden, objects, and, human, bodies, were, interred, in, the, ash, their, eventual, decay, allowed, archaeologists, to, create, moulds, of, figures, in, their, final, moments, of, life, the, numerous, graffiti, carved, on, outside, walls, and, inside, rooms, provide, a, wealth, of, examples, of, the, largely, lost, vulgar, latin, spoken, colloquially, at, the, time, contrasting, with, the, formal, language, of, classical, writers, following, its, destruction, pompeii, remained, largely, undisturbed, until, its, rediscovery, in, the, late, 16th, century, major, excavations, did, not, begin, until, the, mid, 18th, century, which, marked, the, emergence, of, modern, archeology, initial, efforts, to, unearth, the, city, were, haphazard, or, marred, by, looting, resulting, in, many, items, or, sites, being, damaged, or, destroyed, by, 1960, most, of, pompeii, had, been, uncovered, but, left, in, decay, further, major, excavations, were, banned, or, limited, to, targeted, prioritised, areas, since, 2018, these, efforts, have, led, to, new, discoveries, in, some, previously, unexplored, areas, of, the, city, including, a, banquet, hall, adorned, with, rare, well, preserved, frescoes, depicting, various, mythological, scenes, and, figures, pompeii, is, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, owing, to, its, status, as, the, only, archaeological, site, in, the, world, that, provides, a, complete, picture, of, an, ancient, roman, city, it, is, among, the, most, popular, tourist, attractions, in, italy, with, approximately, 2, 5, million, visitors, annually, pompeii, in, latin, is, a, second, declension, masculine, nominative, plural, noun, pompei, rum, according, to, theodor, kraus, the, root, of, the, word, pompeii, would, appear, to, be, the, oscan, word, for, the, number, five, pompe, which, suggests, that, either, the, community, consisted, of, five, hamlets, or, perhaps, it, was, settled, by, a, family, group, gens, pompeia, pompeii, was, built, approximately, 40, m, 130, ft, above, sea, level, on, a, coastal, lava, plateau, created, by, earlier, eruptions, of, mount, vesuvius, 8, km, or, 5, mi, distant, the, plateau, fell, steeply, to, the, south, and, partly, to, the, west, into, the, sea, three, layers, of, sediment, from, large, landslides, lie, on, top, of, the, lava, perhaps, triggered, by, extended, rainfall, the, city, once, by, the, shoreline, is, today, circa, 700, m, 2, 300, ft, inland, the, mouth, of, the, navigable, sarno, river, adjacent, to, the, city, was, protected, by, lagoons, and, served, early, greek, and, phoenician, sailors, as, a, haven, port, later, developed, by, the, romans, pompeii, covered, a, total, of, 64, to, 67, hectares, 160, to, 170, acres, and, was, home, to, 11, 000, to, 11, 500, people, based, on, household, counts, although, best, known, for, its, roman, remains, visible, today, dating, from, ad, 79, it, was, built, upon, a, substantial, city, dating, from, much, earlier, times, expansion, of, the, city, from, an, early, nucleus, the, old, town, accelerated, after, 450, bc, under, the, greeks, following, the, battle, of, cumae, the, first, stable, settlements, on, the, site, date, to, the, 8th, century, bc, when, the, oscans, a, population, of, central, italy, founded, five, villages, in, the, area, with, the, arrival, of, the, greeks, in, campania, from, around, 740, bc, pompeii, entered, the, orbit, of, the, hellenic, people, the, most, important, building, of, this, period, is, the, doric, temple, built, away, from, the, centre, in, what, would, later, become, the, triangular, forum, 62, at, the, same, time, the, cult, of, apollo, was, introduced, greek, and, phoenician, sailors, used, the, location, as, a, safe, port, in, the, early, 6th, century, bc, the, settlement, merged, into, a, single, community, centred, on, the, important, crossroad, between, cumae, nola, and, stabiae, and, was, surrounded, by, a, tufa, city, wall, the, pappamonte, wall, the, first, wall, which, was, also, used, as, a, base, for, the, later, wall, unusually, enclosed, a, much, greater, area, than, the, early, town, together, with, much, agricultural, land, that, such, an, impressive, wall, was, built, at, this, time, indicates, that, the, settlement, was, already, important, and, wealthy, the, city, began, to, flourish, and, maritime, trade, started, with, the, construction, of, a, small, port, near, the, mouth, of, the, river, the, earliest, settlement, was, focused, in, regions, vii, and, viii, of, the, town, the, old, town, as, identified, from, stratigraphy, below, the, samnite, and, roman, buildings, as, well, as, from, the, different, and, irregular, street, plan, by, 524, bc, the, etruscans, had, settled, in, the, area, including, pompeii, finding, in, the, river, sarno, a, communication, route, between, the, sea, and, the, interior, like, the, greeks, the, etruscans, did, not, conquer, the, city, militarily, but, simply, controlled, it, and, pompeii, enjoyed, a, sort, of, autonomy, 63, nevertheless, pompeii, became, a, member, of, the, etruscan, league, of, cities, excavations, in, 1980, 1981, have, shown, the, presence, of, etruscan, inscriptions, and, a, 6th, century, bc, necropolis, under, the, etruscans, a, primitive, forum, or, simple, market, square, was, built, as, well, as, the, temple, of, apollo, in, both, of, which, objects, including, fragments, of, bucchero, were, found, by, maiuri, several, houses, were, built, with, the, so, called, tuscan, atrium, typical, of, this, people, 64, the, city, wall, was, strengthened, in, the, early, 5th, century, bc, with, two, fa, ades, of, relatively, thin, vertically, set, slabs, of, sarno, limestone, some, four, metres, 13, ft, apart, filled, with, earth, the, orthostate, wall, in, 474, bc, the, greek, city, of, cumae, allied, with, syracuse, defeated, the, etruscans, at, the, battle, of, cumae, and, gained, control, of, the, area, the, period, between, about, 450, 375, bc, witnessed, large, areas, of, the, city, being, abandoned, while, important, sanctuaries, such, as, the, temple, of, apollo, show, a, sudden, lack, of, votive, material, remains, the, samnites, people, from, the, areas, of, abruzzo, and, molise, and, allies, of, the, romans, conquered, greek, cumae, between, 423, and, 420, bc, it, is, likely, that, all, of, the, surrounding, territory, including, pompeii, was, already, conquered, around, 424, bc, the, new, rulers, gradually, imposed, their, architecture, and, enlarged, the, town, from, 343, to, 341, bc, in, the, samnite, wars, the, first, roman, army, entered, the, campanian, plain, bringing, with, it, the, customs, and, traditions, of, rome, and, in, the, roman, latin, war, from, 340, bc, the, samnites, were, faithful, to, rome, although, governed, by, the, samnites, pompeii, entered, the, roman, orbit, to, which, it, remained, faithful, even, during, the, third, samnite, war, and, in, the, war, against, pyrrhus, in, the, late, 4th, century, bc, the, city, began, expanding, from, its, nucleus, into, the, open, walled, area, the, street, plan, of, the, new, areas, was, more, regular, and, more, conformal, to, hippodamus, s, street, plan, the, city, walls, were, reinforced, in, sarno, stone, in, the, early, 3rd, century, bc, the, limestone, enceinte, or, the, first, samnite, wall, it, formed, the, basis, for, the, currently, visible, walls, with, an, outer, wall, of, rectangular, limestone, blocks, as, a, terrace, wall, supporting, a, large, agger, or, earth, embankment, behind, it, after, the, samnite, wars, from, 290, bc, pompeii, was, forced, to, accept, the, status, of, socii, of, rome, maintaining, however, linguistic, and, administrative, autonomy, from, the, outbreak, of, the, second, punic, war, 218, 201, bc, in, which, hannibal, s, invasion, threatened, many, cities, pompeii, remained, faithful, to, rome, unlike, many, of, the, southern, cities, as, a, result, an, additional, internal, wall, was, built, of, tufa, and, the, internal, agger, and, outer, fa, ade, raised, resulting, in, a, double, parapet, with, a, wider, wall, walk, despite, the, political, uncertainty, of, these, events, and, the, progressive, migration, of, wealthy, men, to, quieter, cities, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, pompeii, continued, to, flourish, due, to, the, production, and, trade, of, wine, and, oil, with, places, like, provence, and, spain, as, well, as, to, intensive, agriculture, on, farms, around, the, city, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, pompeii, enriched, itself, by, taking, part, in, rome, s, conquest, of, the, east, as, shown, by, a, statue, of, apollo, in, the, forum, erected, by, lucius, mummius, in, gratitude, for, their, support, in, the, sack, of, corinth, and, the, eastern, campaigns, these, riches, enabled, pompeii, to, bloom, and, expand, to, its, ultimate, limits, the, forum, and, many, public, and, private, buildings, of, high, architectural, quality, were, built, including, the, large, theatre, the, temple, of, jupiter, the, basilica, the, comitium, the, stabian, baths, and, a, new, two, story, portico, pompeii, was, one, of, the, towns, of, campania, that, rebelled, against, rome, in, the, social, wars, and, in, 89, bc, it, was, besieged, by, sulla, who, targeted, the, strategically, vulnerable, porta, ercolano, with, his, artillery, as, can, still, be, seen, by, the, impact, craters, of, thousands, of, ballista, shots, in, the, walls, many, nearby, buildings, inside, the, walls, were, also, destroyed, although, the, battle, hardened, troops, of, the, social, league, headed, by, lucius, cluentius, helped, in, resisting, the, romans, pompeii, was, forced, to, surrender, after, the, conquest, of, nola, the, result, was, that, pompeii, became, a, roman, colony, named, colonia, cornelia, veneria, pompeianorum, many, of, sulla, s, veterans, were, given, land, and, property, in, and, around, the, city, while, many, who, opposed, rome, were, dispossessed, of, their, property, despite, this, the, pompeians, were, granted, roman, citizenship, and, quickly, assimilated, into, the, roman, world, the, main, language, in, the, city, became, latin, and, many, of, pompeii, s, old, aristocratic, families, latinized, their, names, as, a, sign, of, assimilation, the, area, around, pompeii, became, very, prosperous, due, to, the, desirability, of, living, on, the, bay, of, naples, for, wealthy, romans, and, due, to, the, rich, agricultural, land, many, farms, and, villas, were, built, nearby, outside, the, city, and, many, have, been, excavated, these, include, the, villa, of, the, mysteries, villa, of, diomedes, several, at, boscoreale, boscotrecase, oplontis, terzigno, and, civita, guiliana, the, city, became, an, important, passage, for, goods, that, arrived, by, sea, and, had, to, be, sent, toward, rome, or, southern, italy, along, the, nearby, appian, way, many, public, buildings, were, constructed, or, refurbished, and, improved, under, the, new, order, new, buildings, included, the, amphitheatre, of, pompeii, in, 70, bc, the, forum, baths, and, the, odeon, in, comparison, the, forum, was, embellished, with, the, colonnade, of, popidius, before, 80, bc, these, buildings, raised, the, status, of, pompeii, as, a, cultural, centre, in, the, region, as, it, outshone, its, neighbours, in, the, number, of, places, for, entertainment, which, significantly, enhanced, the, social, and, economic, development, of, the, city, under, augustus, from, about, 30, bc, a, major, expansion, in, new, public, buildings, as, in, the, rest, of, the, empire, included, the, eumachia, building, the, sanctuary, of, augustus, and, the, macellum, from, about, 20, bc, pompeii, was, fed, with, running, water, by, a, spur, from, the, serino, aqueduct, built, by, marcus, vipsanius, agrippa, in, ad, 59, there, was, a, serious, riot, and, bloodshed, in, the, amphitheatre, between, pompeians, and, nucerians, which, is, recorded, in, a, fresco, and, which, led, the, roman, senate, to, send, the, praetorian, guard, to, restore, order, and, to, ban, further, events, for, ten, years, the, inhabitants, of, pompeii, had, long, been, used, to, minor, earthquakes, indeed, the, writer, pliny, the, younger, wrote, that, earth, tremors, were, not, particularly, alarming, because, they, are, frequent, in, campania, but, on, 5, february, 62, a, severe, earthquake, did, considerable, damage, around, the, bay, and, particularly, to, pompeii, it, is, believed, that, the, earthquake, would, have, registered, between, 5, and, 6, on, the, richter, magnitude, scale, on, that, day, in, pompeii, there, were, to, be, two, sacrifices, as, it, was, the, anniversary, of, augustus, being, named, pater, patriae, father, of, the, country, and, also, a, feast, day, to, honour, the, guardian, spirits, of, the, city, chaos, followed, the, earthquake, fires, caused, by, oil, lamps, that, had, fallen, during, the, quake, added, to, the, panic, the, nearby, cities, of, herculaneum, and, nuceria, were, also, affected, between, 62, ad, and, the, eruption, in, 79, ad, most, rebuilding, was, done, in, the, private, sector, and, older, damaged, frescoes, were, often, covered, with, newer, ones, for, example, in, the, public, sector, the, opportunity, was, taken, to, improve, buildings, and, the, city, plan, e, g, in, the, forum, an, important, field, of, current, research, concerns, structures, that, were, restored, between, the, earthquake, of, 62, and, the, eruption, it, was, thought, until, recently, that, some, of, the, damage, had, still, not, been, repaired, at, the, time, of, the, eruption, but, this, is, doubtful, as, the, evidence, of, missing, forum, statues, and, marble, wall, veneers, are, most, likely, due, to, robbers, after, the, city, s, burial, the, public, buildings, on, the, east, side, of, the, forum, were, largely, restored, and, were, enhanced, by, beautiful, marble, veneers, and, other, modifications, to, the, architecture, some, buildings, like, the, central, baths, were, only, started, after, the, earthquake, and, were, built, to, enhance, the, city, with, modern, developments, in, their, architecture, as, had, been, done, in, rome, in, terms, of, wall, heating, and, window, glass, and, with, well, lit, spacious, rooms, the, new, baths, took, over, a, whole, insula, by, demolishing, houses, which, may, have, been, made, easier, by, the, earthquake, that, had, damaged, these, houses, this, shows, that, the, city, was, still, flourishing, rather, than, struggling, to, recover, from, the, earthquake, in, about, 64, nero, and, his, wife, poppaea, visited, pompeii, and, made, gifts, to, the, temple, of, venus, the, city, s, patron, deity, probably, when, he, performed, in, the, theatre, of, naples, by, 79, pompeii, had, a, population, of, 20, 000, which, had, prospered, from, the, region, s, renowned, agricultural, fertility, and, favourable, location, although, more, recent, estimates, are, up, to, 11, 500, based, on, household, counts, the, eruption, lasted, for, two, days, the, first, phase, was, of, pumice, rain, lapilli, lasting, about, 18, hours, allowing, most, inhabitants, to, escape, only, approximately, 1, 150, bodies, have, so, far, been, found, on, site, which, seems, to, confirm, this, theory, and, most, escapees, probably, managed, to, salvage, some, of, their, most, valuable, belongings, many, skeletons, were, found, with, jewellery, coins, and, silverware, at, some, time, in, the, night, or, early, the, next, day, pyroclastic, flows, began, near, the, volcano, consisting, of, high, speed, dense, and, scorching, ash, clouds, knocking, down, wholly, or, partly, all, structures, in, their, path, incinerating, or, suffocating, the, remaining, population, and, altering, the, landscape, including, the, coastline, by, the, evening, of, the, second, day, the, eruption, was, over, leaving, only, haze, in, the, atmosphere, through, which, the, sun, shone, weakly, a, multidisciplinary, volcanological, and, bio, anthropological, study, of, the, eruption, products, and, victims, merged, with, numerical, simulations, and, experiments, indicates, that, at, pompeii, and, surrounding, towns, heat, was, the, main, cause, of, death, of, people, previously, believed, to, have, died, by, ash, suffocation, the, results, of, the, study, published, in, 2010, show, that, exposure, to, at, least, 250, c, 480, f, hot, pyroclastic, flows, at, a, distance, of, 10, kilometres, 6, miles, from, the, vent, was, sufficient, to, cause, instant, death, even, if, people, were, sheltered, within, buildings, the, people, and, buildings, of, pompeii, were, covered, in, up, to, twelve, different, layers, of, tephra, in, total, up, to, 6, metres, 19, 7, ft, deep, archaeology, in, 2023, showed, that, some, buildings, collapsed, due, to, one, or, more, earthquakes, during, the, eruption, killing, the, occupants, pliny, the, younger, provided, a, first, hand, account, of, the, eruption, of, mount, vesuvius, from, his, position, across, the, bay, of, naples, at, misenum, but, it, was, written, approximately, 27, or, 28, years, after, the, event, his, uncle, pliny, the, elder, with, whom, he, had, a, close, relationship, died, while, attempting, to, rescue, stranded, victims, as, admiral, of, the, fleet, pliny, the, elder, had, ordered, the, ships, of, the, imperial, navy, stationed, at, misenum, to, cross, the, bay, to, assist, evacuation, attempts, volcanologists, have, recognised, the, importance, of, pliny, the, younger, s, account, of, the, eruption, by, calling, similar, events, plinian, it, had, long, been, thought, that, the, eruption, was, an, august, event, based, on, one, version, of, the, letter, but, another, version, gives, a, date, of, the, eruption, as, late, as, 23, november, a, later, date, is, consistent, with, a, charcoal, inscription, at, the, site, discovered, in, 2018, which, includes, the, date, of, 17, october, and, which, must, have, been, recently, written, a, collaborative, study, in, 2022, determined, a, date, of, 24, 25, october, an, october, november, eruption, is, clearly, supported, by, many, pieces, of, evidence, the, fact, that, people, buried, in, the, ash, appear, to, have, been, wearing, heavier, clothing, than, the, light, summer, clothes, typical, of, august, the, fresh, fruit, and, vegetables, in, the, shops, are, typical, of, october, and, conversely, the, summer, fruit, typical, of, august, was, already, being, sold, in, dried, or, conserved, form, nuts, from, chestnut, trees, were, found, at, oplontis, which, would, not, have, been, mature, before, mid, september, wine, fermenting, jars, had, been, sealed, which, would, have, happened, around, the, end, of, october, coins, found, in, the, purse, of, a, woman, buried, in, the, ash, include, one, with, a, 15th, imperatorial, acclamation, among, the, emperor, s, titles, these, coins, could, not, have, been, minted, before, the, second, week, of, september, titus, appointed, two, ex, consuls, to, organise, a, relief, effort, while, donating, large, amounts, of, money, from, the, imperial, treasury, to, aid, the, victims, of, the, volcano, he, visited, pompeii, once, after, the, eruption, and, again, the, following, year, but, no, work, was, done, on, recovery, soon, after, the, city, s, burial, survivors, and, possibly, thieves, came, to, salvage, valuables, including, the, marble, statues, from, the, forum, and, other, precious, materials, from, buildings, there, is, wide, evidence, of, post, eruption, disturbance, including, holes, made, through, walls, the, city, was, not, completely, buried, and, the, tops, of, larger, buildings, would, have, been, visible, above, the, ash, making, it, obvious, where, to, dig, or, salvage, building, material, the, robbers, left, traces, of, their, passage, as, in, a, house, where, modern, archaeologists, found, a, wall, graffito, saying, house, dug, over, the, following, centuries, its, name, and, location, were, forgotten, though, it, still, appeared, on, the, tabula, peutingeriana, of, the, 4th, century, further, eruptions, particularly, in, 471, 473, and, 512, covered, the, remains, more, deeply, the, area, became, known, as, the, la, civita, the, city, due, to, the, features, in, the, ground, the, next, known, date, that, any, part, was, unearthed, was, in, 1592, when, architect, domenico, fontana, while, digging, an, underground, aqueduct, to, the, mills, of, torre, annunziata, ran, into, ancient, walls, covered, with, paintings, and, inscriptions, his, aqueduct, passed, through, and, underneath, a, large, part, of, the, city, and, would, have, had, to, pass, through, many, buildings, and, foundations, as, they, still, can, be, seen, in, many, places, today, however, he, kept, the, finding, secret, in, 1689, francesco, picchetti, saw, a, wall, inscription, mentioning, decurio, pompeiis, town, councillor, of, pompeii, but, he, associated, it, with, a, villa, of, pompey, francesco, bianchini, pointed, out, the, true, meaning, and, he, was, supported, by, giuseppe, macrini, who, in, 1693, excavated, some, walls, and, wrote, that, pompeii, lay, beneath, la, civita, herculaneum, was, rediscovered, in, 1738, by, workers, digging, for, the, foundations, of, a, summer, palace, for, the, king, of, naples, charles, of, bourbon, due, to, the, spectacular, quality, of, the, finds, the, spanish, military, engineer, roque, joaqu, n, de, alcubierre, made, excavations, to, find, further, remains, at, the, site, of, pompeii, in, 1748, even, if, the, city, was, not, identified, charles, of, bourbon, took, great, interest, in, the, finds, even, after, leaving, to, become, king, of, spain, because, the, display, of, antiquities, reinforced, naples, political, and, cultural, prestige, on, 20, august, 1763, an, inscription, rei, publicae, pompeianorum, was, found, and, the, city, was, identified, as, pompeii, karl, weber, directed, the, first, scientific, excavations, he, was, followed, in, 1764, by, military, engineer, franscisco, la, vega, who, was, succeeded, by, his, brother, pietro, in, 1804, there, was, much, progress, in, exploration, when, the, french, occupied, naples, in, 1799, and, ruled, over, italy, from, 1806, to, 1815, the, land, on, which, pompeii, lies, was, confiscated, and, up, to, 700, workers, were, employed, in, the, excavations, the, excavated, areas, in, the, north, and, south, were, connected, parts, of, the, via, dell, abbondanza, were, also, exposed, in, the, west, east, direction, and, for, the, first, time, an, impression, of, the, size, and, appearance, of, the, ancient, town, could, be, appreciated, in, the, following, years, the, excavators, struggled, with, a, lack, of, money, excavations, progressed, slowly, but, with, significant, finds, such, as, the, houses, of, the, faun, of, menandro, of, the, tragic, poet, and, the, surgeon, giuseppe, fiorelli, took, charge, of, the, excavations, in, 1863, and, made, greater, progress, during, early, excavations, of, the, site, occasional, voids, in, the, ash, layer, had, been, found, that, contained, human, remains, fiorelli, realised, these, were, spaces, left, by, the, decomposed, bodies, and, so, devised, the, technique, of, injecting, plaster, into, them, to, recreate, the, forms, of, vesuvius, s, victims, this, technique, is, still, in, use, today, with, a, clear, resin, now, used, instead, of, plaster, because, it, is, more, durable, and, does, not, destroy, the, bones, allowing, further, analysis, fiorelli, also, introduced, scientific, documentation, he, divided, the, city,

reports, under, his, successors, the, entire, west, section, of, the, city, was, exposed, after, those, of, fiorelli, excavations, continued, in, an, increasingly, more, systematic, and, considered, manner, under, several, directors, of, archaeology, though, still, with, the, main, interest, in, making, spectacular, discoveries, and, uncovering, more, houses, rather, than, answering, the, main,

and, anthropic, deterioration, following, excavation, weathering, erosion, light, exposure, water, damage, poor, methods, of, excavation, and, reconstruction, introduced, plants, and, animals, tourism, vandalism, and, theft, have, all, damaged, the, site, in, some, way, the, lack, of, adequate, weather, protection, for, all, but, the, most, interesting, and, important, buildings, has, allowed, original, interior, decoration, to, fade, or, be, lost, two, thirds, of, the, city, has, been, excavated, but, the, remnants, of, the, city, are, rapidly, deteriorating, furthermore, during,

archaeologists, the, ancient, city, was, included, in, the, 1996, world, monuments, watch, by, the, world, monuments, fund, and, again, in, 1998, and, in, 2000, in, 1996, the, organisation, claimed, that, pompeii, desperately, need, repair, and, called, for, the, drafting, of, a, general, plan, of, restoration, and, interpretation, the, organisation, supported, conservation, at, pompeii, with, funding, from, american, express, and, the, samuel, h, kress, foundation, the, schola, armatorum, house, of, the, gladiators, collapsed, in, 2010, caused, by, heavy, rainfall, and, lack, of, proper, drainage, the, structure, was, not, open, to, visitors, but, the, outside, was, visible, to, tourists, there, was, fierce, controversy, after, the, collapse, with, accusations, of, neglect, today, funding, is, mostly, directed, into, conservation, of, the, site, however, due, to, the, expanse, of, pompeii, and, the, scale, of, the, problems, this, is, inadequate, in, halting, the, slow, decay, of, the, materials, a, 2012, study, recommended, an, improved, strategy, for, interpretation, and, presentation, of, the, site, as, a, cost, effective, method, of, improving, its, conservation, and, preservation, in, the, short, term, in, june, 2013, unesco, warned, that, if, restoration, and, preservation, works, fail, to, deliver, substantial, progress, in, the, next, two, years, pompeii, could, be, placed, on, the, list, of, world, heritage, in, danger, a, grande, progetto, pompei, project, of, about, five, years, had, begun, in, 2012, with, the, european, union, and, included,

pompeii, is, of, great, interest, for, the, study, of, ancient, roman, architecture, in, terms, of, building, methods, and, urban, planning, however, it, was, a, relatively, small, provincial, city, and, except, for, the, amphitheatre, it, did, not, have, large, monuments, on, the, scale, of, other, roman, cities, it, also, missed, the, large, building, schemes, of, the, early, empire, and, kept, much, of, its, urban, architecture, dating, from, as, early, as, the, 4th, century, bc, the, evolution, of, pompeii, s, private, and, public, buildings, is, often, unclear, because, of, the, lack, of, excavations, beneath, the, levels, of, 79, it, is, however, clear, that, by, the, time, of, the, conquest, by, sulla, in, 89, bc, the, development, of, the, street, layout, was, largely, complete, and, most, of, the, insulae, were, built, under, the, romans, pompeii, underwent, a, process, of, urban, development, which, accelerated, in, the, augustan, period, from, about, 30, bc, new, public,
