https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age
the, islamic, golden, age, was, a, period, of, scientific, economic, and, cultural, flourishing, in, the, history, of, islam, traditionally, dated, from, the, 8th, century, to, the, 13th, century, this, period, is, traditionally, understood, to, have, begun, during, the, reign, of, the, abbasid, caliph, harun, al, rashid, 786, to, 809, with, the, inauguration, of, the, house, of, wisdom, which, saw, scholars, from, all, over, the, muslim, world, flock, to, baghdad, the, world, s, largest, city, by, then, to, translate, the, known, world, s, classical, knowledge, into, arabic, and, persian, the, period, is, traditionally, said, to, have, ended, with, the, collapse, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, due, to, mongol, invasions, and, the, siege, of, baghdad, in, 1258, there, are, a, few, alternative, timelines, some, scholars, extend, the, end, date, of, the, golden, age, to, around, 1350, including, the, timurid, renaissance, within, it, while, others, place, the, end, of, the, islamic, golden, age, as, late, as, the, end, of, 15th, to, 16th, centuries, including, the, rise, of, the, islamic, gunpowder, empires, the, metaphor, of, a, golden, age, began, to, be, applied, in, 19th, century, literature, about, islamic, history, in, the, context, of, the, western, aesthetic, fashion, known, as, orientalism, the, author, of, a, handbook, for, travelers, in, syria, and, palestine, in, 1868, observed, that, the, most, beautiful, mosques, of, damascus, were, like, mohammedanism, itself, now, rapidly, decaying, and, relics, of, the, golden, age, of, islam, there, is, no, unambiguous, definition, of, the, term, and, depending, on, whether, it, is, used, with, a, focus, on, cultural, or, on, military, achievement, it, may, be, taken, to, refer, to, rather, disparate, time, spans, thus, one, 19th, century, author, would, have, it, extend, to, the, duration, of, the, caliphate, or, to, six, and, a, half, centuries, while, another, would, have, it, end, after, only, a, few, decades, of, rashidun, conquests, with, the, death, of, umar, and, the, first, fitna, during, the, early, 20th, century, the, term, was, used, only, occasionally, and, often, referred, to, as, the, early, military, successes, of, the, rashidun, caliphs, it, was, only, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, that, the, term, came, to, be, used, with, any, frequency, now, mostly, referring, to, the, cultural, flourishing, of, science, and, mathematics, under, the, caliphates, during, the, 9th, to, 11th, centuries, between, the, establishment, of, organised, scholarship, in, the, house, of, wisdom, and, the, beginning, of, the, crusades, but, often, extended, to, include, part, of, the, late, 8th, or, the, 12th, to, early, 13th, centuries, definitions, may, still, vary, considerably, equating, the, end, of, the, golden, age, with, the, end, of, the, caliphates, is, a, convenient, cut, off, point, based, on, a, historical, landmark, but, it, can, be, argued, that, islamic, culture, had, entered, a, gradual, decline, much, earlier, thus, khan, 2003, identifies, the, proper, golden, age, as, being, the, two, centuries, between, 750, and, 950, arguing, that, the, beginning, loss, of, territories, under, harun, al, rashid, worsened, after, the, death, of, al, ma, mun, in, 833, and, that, the, crusades, in, the, 12th, century, resulted, in, a, weakening, of, the, islamic, empire, from, which, it, never, recovered, regarding, the, end, of, the, gola, mohamad, abdalla, argues, the, dominant, approach, by, scholars, is, the, decline, theory, the, golden, age, is, considered, to, have, come, into, existence, through, a, gigantic, endeavor, to, acquire, and, translate, the, ancient, sciences, of, the, greeks, between, the, eighth, and, ninth, centuries, the, translations, era, was, followed, by, two, centuries, of, splendid, original, thinking, and, contributions, and, is, known, as, the, golden, age, of, islamic, science, this, so, called, golden, age, is, supposed, to, have, lasted, from, the, end, of, the, ninth, to, the, end, of, the, eleventh, century, the, era, after, this, period, is, conventionally, known, as, the, age, of, decline, a, survey, of, literature, from, the, nineteenth, century, onwards, demonstrates, that, the, decline, theory, has, become, the, preferred, paradigm, in, general, academia, the, various, quranic, injunctions, and, hadith, or, actions, of, muhammad, which, place, values, on, education, and, emphasize, the, importance, of, acquiring, knowledge, played, a, vital, role, in, influencing, the, muslims, of, this, age, in, their, search, for, knowledge, and, the, development, of, the, body, of, science, the, islamic, empire, heavily, patronized, scholars, the, money, spent, on, the, translation, movement, for, some, translations, is, estimated, to, be, equivalent, to, about, twice, the, annual, research, budget, of, the, united, kingdom, s, medical, research, council, the, best, scholars, and, notable, translators, such, as, hunayn, ibn, ishaq, had, salaries, that, are, estimated, to, be, the, equivalent, of, professional, athletes, today, the, house, of, wisdom, was, a, library, established, in, abbasid, era, baghdad, iraq, by, caliph, al, mansur, in, 825, modeled, after, the, academy, of, jundishapur, during, this, period, the, muslims, showed, a, strong, interest, in, assimilating, the, scientific, knowledge, of, the, civilizations, that, had, been, conquered, many, classic, works, of, antiquity, that, might, otherwise, have, been, lost, were, translated, from, greek, syriac, middle, persian, and, sanskrit, into, syriac, and, arabic, some, of, which, were, later, in, turn, translated, into, other, languages, like, hebrew, and, latin, christians, especially, the, adherents, of, the, church, of, the, east, nestorians, contributed, to, islamic, civilization, during, the, reign, of, the, umayyads, and, the, abbasids, by, translating, works, of, greek, philosophers, and, ancient, science, to, syriac, and, afterwards, to, arabic, they, also, excelled, in, many, fields, in, particular, philosophy, science, such, as, hunayn, ibn, ishaq, yusuf, al, khuri, al, himsi, qusta, ibn, luqa, masawaiyh, patriarch, eutychius, and, jabril, ibn, bukhtishu, and, theology, for, a, long, period, of, time, the, personal, physicians, of, the, abbasid, caliphs, were, often, assyrian, christians, among, the, most, prominent, christian, families, to, serve, as, physicians, to, the, caliphs, were, the, bukhtishu, dynasty, throughout, the, 4th, to, 7th, centuries, christian, scholarly, work, in, the, greek, and, syriac, languages, was, either, newly, translated, or, had, been, preserved, since, the, hellenistic, period, among, the, prominent, centers, of, learning, and, transmission, of, classical, wisdom, were, christian, colleges, such, as, the, school, of, nisibis, and, the, school, of, edessa, the, pagan, center, of, learning, in, harran, and, the, renowned, hospital, and, medical, academy, of, gondishapur, which, was, the, intellectual, theological, and, scientific, center, of, the, church, of, the, east, many, scholars, of, the, house, of, wisdom, were, of, christian, background, and, it, was, led, by, christian, physician, hunayn, ibn, ishaq, with, the, support, of, byzantine, medicine, many, of, the, most, important, philosophical, and, scientific, works, of, the, ancient, world, were, translated, including, the, work, of, galen, hippocrates, plato, aristotle, ptolemy, and, archimedes, persians, also, were, a, notably, high, proportion, of, scientists, who, contributed, to, the, islamic, golden, age, according, to, bernard, lewis, culturally, politically, and, most, remarkable, of, all, even, religiously, the, persian, contribution, to, this, new, islamic, civilization, is, of, immense, importance, the, work, of, iranians, can, be, seen, in, every, field, of, cultural, endeavor, including, arabic, poetry, to, which, poets, of, iranian, origin, composing, their, poems, in, arabic, made, a, very, significant, contribution, while, cultural, influence, used, to, radiate, outward, from, baghdad, after, the, mongol, destruction, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, arab, influence, decreased, iran, and, central, asia, benefiting, from, increased, cross, cultural, access, to, east, asia, under, mongol, rule, flourished, and, developed, more, distinctively, from, arab, influence, such, as, the, timurid, renaissance, under, the, timurid, dynasty, with, a, new, and, easier, writing, system, and, the, introduction, of, paper, information, was, democratized, to, the, extent, that, for, probably, the, first, time, in, history, it, became, possible, to, make, a, living, from, only, writing, and, selling, books, the, use, of, paper, spread, from, china, into, muslim, regions, in, the, eighth, century, through, mass, production, in, samarkand, and, khorasan, arriving, in, al, andalus, on, the, iberian, peninsula, modern, spain, and, portugal, in, the, 10th, century, it, was, easier, to, manufacture, than, parchment, less, likely, to, crack, than, papyrus, and, could, absorb, ink, making, it, difficult, to, erase, and, ideal, for, keeping, records, islamic, paper, makers, devised, assembly, line, methods, of, hand, copying, manuscripts, to, turn, out, editions, far, larger, than, any, available, in, europe, for, centuries, it, was, from, these, countries, that, the, rest, of, the, world, learned, to, make, paper, from, linen, the, centrality, of, scripture, and, its, study, in, the, islamic, tradition, helped, to, make, education, a, central, pillar, of, the, religion, in, virtually, all, times, and, places, in, the, history, of, islam, the, importance, of, learning, in, the, islamic, tradition, is, reflected, in, a, number, of, hadiths, attributed, to, muhammad, including, one, that, states, seeking, knowledge, is, obligatory, upon, every, muslim, this, injunction, was, seen, to, apply, particularly, to, scholars, but, also, to, some, extent, to, the, wider, muslim, public, as, exemplified, by, the, dictum, of, al, zarnuji, learning, is, prescribed, for, us, all, while, it, is, impossible, to, calculate, literacy, rates, in, pre, modern, islamic, societies, it, is, almost, certain, that, they, were, relatively, high, at, least, in, comparison, to, their, european, counterparts, education, would, begin, at, a, young, age, with, study, of, arabic, and, the, quran, either, at, home, or, in, a, primary, school, which, was, often, attached, to, a, mosque, some, students, would, then, proceed, to, training, in, tafsir, quranic, exegesis, and, fiqh, islamic, jurisprudence, which, was, seen, as, particularly, important, education, focused, on, memorization, but, also, trained, the, more, advanced, students, to, participate, as, readers, and, writers, in, the, tradition, of, commentary, on, the, studied, texts, it, also, involved, a, process, of, socialization, of, aspiring, scholars, who, came, from, virtually, all, social, backgrounds, into, the, ranks, of, the, ulema, for, the, first, few, centuries, of, islam, educational, settings, were, entirely, informal, but, beginning, in, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, the, ruling, elites, began, to, establish, institutions, of, higher, religious, learning, known, as, madrasas, in, an, effort, to, secure, support, and, cooperation, of, the, ulema, madrasas, soon, multiplied, throughout, the, islamic, world, which, helped, to, spread, islamic, learning, beyond, urban, centers, and, to, unite, diverse, islamic, communities, in, a, shared, cultural, project, nonetheless, instruction, remained, focused, on, individual, relationships, between, students, and, their, teacher, the, formal, attestation, of, educational, attainment, ijaza, was, granted, by, a, particular, scholar, rather, than, the, institution, and, it, placed, its, holder, within, a, genealogy, of, scholars, which, was, the, only, recognized, hierarchy, in, the, educational, system, while, formal, studies, in, madrasas, were, open, only, to, men, women, of, prominent, urban, families, were, commonly, educated, in, private, settings, and, many, of, them, received, and, later, issued, ijazas, in, hadith, studies, calligraphy, and, poetry, recitation, working, women, learned, religious, texts, and, practical, skills, primarily, from, each, other, though, they, also, received, some, instruction, together, with, men, in, mosques, and, private, homes, madrasas, were, devoted, principally, to, study, of, law, but, they, also, offered, other, subjects, such, as, theology, medicine, and, mathematics, the, madrasa, complex, usually, consisted, of, a, mosque, boarding, house, and, a, library, it, was, maintained, by, a, waqf, charitable, endowment, which, paid, salaries, of, professors, stipends, of, students, and, defrayed, the, costs, of, construction, and, maintenance, the, madrasa, was, unlike, a, modern, college, in, that, it, lacked, a, standardized, curriculum, or, institutionalized, system, of, certification, muslims, distinguished, disciplines, inherited, from, pre, islamic, civilizations, such, as, philosophy, and, medicine, which, they, called, sciences, of, the, ancients, or, rational, sciences, from, islamic, religious, sciences, sciences, of, the, former, type, flourished, for, several, centuries, and, their, transmission, formed, part, of, the, educational, framework, in, classical, and, medieval, islam, in, some, cases, they, were, supported, by, institutions, such, as, the, house, of, wisdom, in, baghdad, but, more, often, they, were, transmitted, informally, from, teacher, to, student, the, university, of, al, karaouine, founded, in, 859, ad, is, listed, in, the, guinness, book, of, records, as, the, world, s, oldest, degree, granting, university, the, al, azhar, university, was, another, early, madrasa, now, recognized, as, a, university, the, madrasa, is, one, of, the, relics, of, the, fatimid, caliphate, the, fatimids, traced, their, descent, to, muhammad, s, daughter, fatimah, and, named, the, institution, using, a, variant, of, her, honorific, title, al, zahra, the, brilliant, organized, instruction, in, the, al, azhar, mosque, began, in, 978, arabic, became, a, trade, language, the, muslim, ruled, spanish, capital, of, c, rdoba, which, surpassed, constantinople, as, the, europe, s, largest, city, also, became, a, prominent, world, leading, centre, of, education, and, learning, producing, numerous, polymaths, juristic, thought, gradually, developed, in, study, circles, where, independent, scholars, met, to, learn, from, a, local, master, and, discuss, religious, topics, at, first, these, circles, were, fluid, in, their, membership, but, with, time, distinct, regional, legal, schools, crystallized, around, shared, sets, of, methodological, principles, as, the, boundaries, of, the, schools, became, clearly, delineated, the, authority, of, their, doctrinal, tenets, came, to, be, vested, in, a, master, jurist, from, earlier, times, who, was, henceforth, identified, as, the, school, s, founder, in, the, course, of, the, first, three, centuries, of, islam, all, legal, schools, came, to, accept, the, broad, outlines, of, classical, legal, theory, according, to, which, islamic, law, had, to, be, firmly, rooted, in, the, quran, and, hadith, the, classical, theory, of, islamic, jurisprudence, elaborates, how, scriptures, should, be, interpreted, from, the, standpoint, of, linguistics, and, rhetoric, it, also, comprises, methods, for, establishing, authenticity, of, hadith, and, for, determining, when, the, legal, force, of, a, scriptural, passage, is, abrogated, by, a, passage, revealed, at, a, later, date, in, addition, to, the, quran, and, sunnah, the, classical, theory, of, sunni, fiqh, recognizes, two, other, sources, of, law, juristic, consensus, ijma, and, analogical, reasoning, qiyas, it, therefore, studies, the, application, and, limits, of, analogy, as, well, as, the, value, and, limits, of, consensus, along, with, other, methodological, principles, some, of, which, are, accepted, by, only, certain, legal, schools, this, interpretive, apparatus, is, brought, together, under, the, rubric, of, ijtihad, which, refers, to, a, jurist, s, exertion, in, an, attempt, to, arrive, at, a, ruling, on, a, particular, question, the, theory, of, twelver, shia, jurisprudence, parallels, that, of, sunni, schools, with, some, differences, such, as, recognition, of, reason, aql, as, a, source, of, law, in, place, of, qiyas, and, extension, of, the, notion, of, sunnah, to, include, traditions, of, the, imams, the, body, of, substantive, islamic, law, was, created, by, independent, jurists, muftis, their, legal, opinions, fatwas, were, taken, into, account, by, ruler, appointed, judges, who, presided, over, q, s, courts, and, by, ma, lim, courts, which, were, controlled, by, the, ruler, s, council, and, administered, criminal, law, classical, islamic, theology, emerged, from, an, early, doctrinal, controversy, which, pitted, the, ahl, al, hadith, movement, led, by, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, who, considered, the, quran, and, authentic, hadith, to, be, the, only, acceptable, authority, in, matters, of, faith, against, mu, tazilites, and, other, theological, currents, who, developed, theological, doctrines, using, rationalistic, methods, in, 833, the, caliph, al, ma, mun, tried, to, impose, mu, tazilite, theology, on, all, religious, scholars, and, instituted, an, inquisition, mihna, but, the, attempts, to, impose, a, caliphal, writ, in, matters, of, religious, orthodoxy, ultimately, failed, this, controversy, persisted, until, al, ash, ari, 874, 936, found, a, middle, ground, between, mu, tazilite, rationalism, and, hanbalite, literalism, using, the, rationalistic, methods, championed, by, mu, tazilites, to, defend, most, substantive, tenets, maintained, by, ahl, al, hadith, a, rival, compromise, between, rationalism, and, literalism, emerged, from, the, work, of, al, maturidi, d, c, 944, and, although, a, minority, of, scholars, remained, faithful, to, the, early, ahl, al, hadith, creed, ash, ari, and, maturidi, theology, came, to, dominate, sunni, islam, from, the, 10th, century, on, ibn, sina, avicenna, and, ibn, rushd, averroes, played, a, major, role, in, interpreting, the, works, of, aristotle, whose, ideas, came, to, dominate, the, non, religious, thought, of, the, christian, and, muslim, worlds, according, to, the, stanford, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, translation, of, philosophical, texts, from, arabic, to, latin, in, western, europe, led, to, the, transformation, of, almost, all, philosophical, disciplines, in, the, medieval, latin, world, the, influence, of, islamic, philosophers, in, europe, was, particularly, strong, in, natural, philosophy, psychology, and, metaphysics, though, it, also, influenced, the, study, of, logic, and, ethics, ibn, sina, argued, his, floating, man, thought, experiment, concerning, self, awareness, in, which, a, man, deprived, of, sense, experience, by, being, blindfolded, and, free, falling, would, still, be, aware, of, his, existence, in, epistemology, ibn, tufail, wrote, the, novel, hayy, ibn, yaqdhan, and, in, response, ibn, al, nafis, wrote, the, novel, theologus, autodidactus, both, were, concerning, autodidacticism, as, illuminated, through, the, life, of, a, feral, child, spontaneously, generated, in, a, cave, on, a, desert, island, persian, mathematician, mu, ammad, ibn, m, s, al, khw, rizm, played, a, significant, role, in, the, development, of, algebra, arithmetic, and, hindu, arabic, numerals, he, has, been, described, as, the, father, or, founder, of, algebra, another, persian, mathematician, omar, khayyam, is, credited, with, identifying, the, foundations, of, analytic, geometry, omar, khayyam, found, the, general, geometric, solution, of, the, cubic, equation, his, book, treatise, on, demonstrations, of, problems, of, algebra, 1070, which, was, a, significant, step, in, the, development, of, algebra, is, part, of, the, body, of, persian, mathematics, that, was, eventually, transmitted, to, europe, yet, another, persian, mathematician, sharaf, al, d, n, al, t, s, found, algebraic, and, numerical, solutions, to, various, cases, of, cubic, equations, he, also, developed, the, concept, of, a, function, ibn, al, haytham, alhazen, discovered, the, sum, formula, for, the, fourth, power, using, a, method, that, could, be, generally, used, to, determine, the, sum, for, any, integral, power, he, used, this, to, find, the, volume, of, a, paraboloid, he, could, find, the, integral, formula, for, any, polynomial, without, having, developed, a, general, formula, islamic, art, makes, use, of, geometric, patterns, and, symmetries, in, many, of, its, art, forms, notably, in, girih, tilings, these, are, formed, using, a, set, of, five, tile, shapes, namely, a, regular, decagon, an, elongated, hexagon, a, bow, tie, a, rhombus, and, a, regular, pentagon, all, the, sides, of, these, tiles, have, the, same, length, and, all, their, angles, are, multiples, of, 36, 5, radians, offering, fivefold, and, tenfold, symmetries, the, tiles, are, decorated, with, strapwork, lines, girih, generally, more, visible, than, the, tile, boundaries, in, 2007, the, physicists, peter, lu, and, paul, steinhardt, argued, that, girih, from, the, 15th, century, resembled, quasicrystalline, penrose, tilings, elaborate, geometric, zellige, tilework, is, a, distinctive, element, in, moroccan, architecture, muqarnas, vaults, are, three, dimensional, but, were, designed, in, two, dimensions, with, drawings, of, geometrical, cells, jamsh, d, al, k, sh, s, estimate, of, pi, would, not, be, surpassed, for, 180, years, ibn, mu, dh, al, jayy, n, is, one, of, the, several, islamic, mathematicians, on, whom, the, law, of, sines, is, attributed, he, wrote, the, book, of, unknown, arcs, of, a, sphere, in, the, 11th, century, this, formula, relates, the, lengths, of, the, sides, of, any, triangle, rather, than, only, right, triangles, to, the, sines, of, its, angles, according, to, the, law, where, a, b, and, c, are, the, lengths, of, the, sides, of, a, triangle, and, a, b, and, c, are, the, opposite, angles, see, figure, the, earliest, use, of, statistical, inference, was, given, by, al, kindi, c, 801, 873, also, known, as, alkindus, in, europe, in, risalah, fi, istikhraj, al, mu, amma, a, manuscript, on, deciphering, cryptographic, messages, which, contains, the, first, description, of, the, method, of, frequency, analysis, ibn, al, haytham, alhazen, was, a, significant, figure, in, the, history, of, scientific, method, particularly, in, his, approach, to, experimentation, and, has, been, described, as, the, world, s, first, true, scientist, avicenna, made, rules, for, testing, the, effectiveness, of, drugs, including, that, the, effect, produced, by, the, experimental, drug, should, be, seen, constantly, or, after, many, repetitions, to, be, counted, the, physician, rhazes, was, an, early, proponent, of, experimental, medicine, and, recommended, using, control, for, clinical, research, he, said, if, you, want, to, study, the, effect, of, bloodletting, on, a, condition, divide, the, patients, into, two, groups, perform, bloodletting, only, on, one, group, watch, both, and, compare, the, results, astronomy, in, islam, was, able, to, grow, greatly, because, of, several, key, factors, one, factor, was, geographical, the, islamic, world, was, close, to, the, ancient, lands, of, the, greeks, which, held, valuable, ancient, knowledge, of, the, heavens, in, greek, manuscripts, during, the, new, abbasid, dynasty, after, the, movement, of, the, capital, in, 762, ad, to, baghdad, translators, were, sponsored, to, translate, greek, texts, into, arabic, this, translation, period, led, to, many, major, scientific, works, from, galen, ptolemy, aristotle, euclid, archimedes, and, apollonius, being, translated, into, arabic, from, these, translations, previously, lost, knowledge, of, the, cosmos, was, now, being, used, to, advance, current, astrological, thinkers, the, second, key, factor, of, astronomy, s, growth, was, the, religious, observances, followed, by, muslims, which, expected, them, to, pray, at, exact, times, during, the, day, these, observances, in, timekeeping, led, to, many, questions, in, previous, greek, mathematical, astronomy, especially, their, timekeeping, the, astrolabe, was, a, greek, invention, which, was, an, important, piece, of, arabic, astronomy, an, astrolabe, is, a, handheld, two, dimensional, model, of, the, sky, which, can, solve, problems, of, spherical, astronomy, it, is, made, up, of, lines, of, altitude, and, azimuth, with, an, index, horizon, hour, circle, zenith, rete, star, pointer, and, equator, to, accurately, show, where, the, stars, are, at, that, given, moment, use, of, the, astrolabe, is, best, expressed, in, al, farghani, s, treatise, on, the, astrolabe, due, to, the, mathematical, way, he, applied, the, instrument, to, astrology, astronomy, and, timekeeping, the, earliest, known, astrolabe, in, existence, today, comes, from, the, islamic, period, it, was, made, by, nastulus, in, 927, 28, ad, and, is, now, a, treasure, of, the, kuwait, national, museum, in, about, 964, ad, the, persian, astronomer, abd, al, rahman, al, sufi, writing, in, his, book, of, fixed, stars, described, a, nebulous, spot, in, the, andromeda, constellation, the, first, definitive, reference, to, what, is, now, known, to, be, the, andromeda, galaxy, the, nearest, spiral, galaxy, to, the, milky, way, the, geocentric, system, developed, by, ptolemy, placed, the, sun, moon, and, other, planets, in, orbit, around, the, earth, ptolemy, thought, that, the, planets, moved, on, circles, called, epicycles, and, that, their, centers, rode, on, deferents, the, deferents, were, eccentric, and, the, angular, motion, of, a, planet, was, uniform, around, the, equant, which, was, a, point, opposite, the, deferent, center, simply, ptolemy, s, models, were, a, mathematical, system, for, predicting, the, positions, of, the, planets, one, of, the, first, to, criticize, this, model, was, ibn, al, haytham, a, leader, of, physics, in, the, 11th, century, in, cairo, then, in, the, 13th, century, nasir, al, din, al, tusi, constructed, the, maragha, observatory, in, what, is, today, iran, al, tusi, found, the, equant, dissatisfying, and, replaced, it, by, adding, a, geometrical, technique, called, a, tusi, couple, which, generates, linear, motion, from, the, sum, of, two, circular, motions, then, ibn, al, shatir, who, was, working, in, damascus, in, 1350, ad, employed, the, tusi, couple, to, successfully, eliminate, the, equant, as, well, as, other, objectionable, circles, that, ptolemy, had, used, this, new, model, properly, aligned, the, celestial, spheres, and, was, mathematically, sound, this, development, by, ibn, al, shatir, as, well, as, the, maragha, astronomers, remained, relatively, unknown, in, medieval, europe, the, names, for, some, of, the, stars, used, including, betelgeuse, rigel, vega, aldebaran, and, fomalhaut, are, several, of, the, names, that, come, directly, from, arabic, origins, or, are, the, translations, of, ptolemy, s, greek, descriptions, which, are, still, in, use, today, alhazen, played, a, role, in, the, development, of, optics, one, of, the, prevailing, theories, of, vision, in, his, time, and, place, was, the, emission, theory, supported, by, euclid, and, ptolemy, where, sight, worked, by, the, eye, emitting, rays, of, light, and, the, other, was, the, aristotelean, theory, that, sight, worked, when, the, essence, of, objects, flows, into, the, eyes, alhazen, correctly, argued, that, vision, occurred, when, light, traveling, in, straight, lines, reflects, off, an, object, into, the, eyes, al, biruni, wrote, of, his, insights, into, light, stating, that, its, velocity, must, be, immense, when, compared, to, the, speed, of, sound, the, early, islamic, period, saw, the, establishment, of, some, of, the, longest, lived, theoretical, frameworks, in, alchemy, and, chemistry, the, sulfur, mercury, theory, of, metals, first, attested, in, pseudo, apollonius, of, tyana, s, sirr, al, khal, qa, the, secret, of, creation, c, 750, 850, and, in, the, arabic, writings, attributed, to, j, bir, ibn, ayy, n, written, c, 850, 950, would, remain, the, basis, of, all, theories, of, metallic, composition, until, the, eighteenth, century, likewise, the, emerald, tablet, a, compact, and, cryptic, text, that, all, later, alchemists, up, to, and, including, isaac, newton, 1642, 1727, would, regard, as, the, foundation, of, their, art, first, occurs, in, the, sirr, al, khal, qa, and, in, one, of, the, works, attributed, to, j, bir, substantial, advances, were, also, made, in, practical, chemistry, the, works, attributed, to, j, bir, and, those, of, the, persian, alchemist, and, physician, ab, bakr, al, r, z, c, 865, 925, contain, the, earliest, known, systematic, classifications, of, chemical, substances, however, alchemists, were, not, only, interested, in, identifying, and, classifying, chemical, substances, but, also, in, artificially, creating, them, significant, examples, from, the, medieval, islamic, world, include, the, synthesis, of, ammonium, chloride, from, organic, substances, as, described, in, the, works, attributed, to, j, bir, and, ab, bakr, al, r, z, s, experiments, with, vitriol, which, would, eventually, lead, to, the, discovery, of, mineral, acids, like, sulfuric, acid, and, nitric, acid, by, thirteenth, century, latin, alchemists, such, as, pseudo, geber, al, biruni, 973, 1050, estimated, the, radius, of, the, earth, as, 6339, 6, km, modern, value, is, c, 6, 371, km, the, best, estimate, at, that, time, modern, commentators, have, likened, medieval, accounts, of, the, struggle, for, existence, in, the, animal, kingdom, to, the, framework, of, the, theory, of, evolution, thus, in, his, survey, of, the, history, of, the, ideas, which, led, to, the, theory, of, natural, selection, conway, zirkle, noted, that, al, jahiz, was, one, of, those, who, discussed, a, struggle, for, existence, in, his, kit, b, al, hayaw, n, book, of, animals, written, in, the, 9th, century, in, the, 13th, century, nasir, al, din, al, tusi, believed, that, humans, were, derived, from, advanced, animals, saying, such, humans, live, in, the, western, sudan, and, other, distant, corners, of, the, world, they, are, close, to, animals, by, their, habits, deeds, and, behavior, in, 1377, ibn, khaldun, in, his, muqaddimah, stated, the, animal, kingdom, was, developed, its, species, multiplied, and, in, the, gradual, process, of, creation, it, ended, in, man, and, arising, from, the, world, of, the, monkeys, in, genetics, al, zahrawi, was, the, first, physician, to, identify, the, hereditary, nature, of, haemophilia, for, islamic, scholars, indian, and, greek, physicians, and, medical, researchers, sushruta, galen, mankah, atreya, hippocrates, charaka, and, agnivesha, were, pre, eminent, authorities, in, order, to, make, the, indian, and, greek, tradition, more, accessible, understandable, and, teachable, islamic, scholars, ordered, and, made, more, systematic, the, vast, indian, and, greco, roman, medical, knowledge, by, writing, encyclopedias, and, summaries, sometimes, past, scholars, were, criticized, like, rhazes, who, criticized, and, refuted, galen, s, revered, theories, most, notably, the, theory, of, humors, and, was, thus, accused, of, ignorance, it, was, through, 12th, century, arabic, translations, that, medieval, europe, rediscovered, hellenic, medicine, including, the, works, of, galen, and, hippocrates, and, discovered, ancient, indian, medicine, including, the, works, of, sushruta, and, charaka, works, such, as, avicenna, s, the, canon, of, medicine, were, translated, into, latin, and, disseminated, throughout, europe, during, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, alone, the, canon, of, medicine, was, published, more, than, thirty, five, times, it, was, used, as, a, standard, medical, textbook, through, the, 18th, century, in, europe, the, largely, dominant, theory, of, the, time, was, humorism, where, four, separate, humors, liquid, substances, including, blood, phlegm, yellow, bile, and, dark, bile, whose, balance, were, thought, to, be, the, key, to, health, and, a, natural, body, temperature, in, the, book, al, shakook, ala, jalinoos, or, the, doubt, on, galen, al, razi, criticized, some, of, galen, s, theories, particularly, humorism, saying, that, they, did, not, agree, with, his, own, clinical, observations, arab, physician, ibn, zuhr, provided, proof, that, scabies, is, caused, by, the, itch, mite, and, that, it, can, be, cured, by, removing, the, parasite, without, the, need, for, purging, bleeding, or, other, treatments, called, for, by, humorism, making, a, break, with, the, humorism, of, galen, and, avicenna, regarding, the, cardiovascular, system, ibn, al, nafis, in, his, commentary, on, anatomy, in, avicenna, s, canon, was, the, first, known, scholar, to, contradict, the, contention, of, the, galen, school, that, blood, could, pass, between, the, ventricles, in, the, heart, through, the, cardiac, inter, ventricular, septum, that, separates, them, saying, that, there, is, no, passage, between, the, ventricles, at, this, point, instead, he, correctly, argued, that, all, the, blood, that, reached, the, left, ventricle, did, so, after, passing, through, the, lung, he, also, stated, that, there, must, be, small, communications, or, pores, between, the, pulmonary, artery, and, pulmonary, vein, a, prediction, that, preceded, the, discovery, of, the, pulmonary, capillaries, of, marcello, malpighi, by, 400, years, the, commentary, was, rediscovered, in, the, twentieth, century, in, the, prussian, state, library, in, berlin, whether, its, view, of, the, pulmonary, circulation, influenced, scientists, such, as, michael, servetus, is, unclear, in, neurology, rhazes, stated, that, nerves, had, motor, or, sensory, functions, describing, 7, cranial, and, 31, spinal, cord, nerves, he, assigned, a, numerical, order, to, the, cranial, nerves, from, the, optic, to, the, hypoglossal, nerves, he, classified, the, spinal, nerves, into, 8, cervical, 12, thoracic, 5, lumbar, 3, sacral, and, 3, coccygeal, nerves, he, used, this, to, link, clinical, signs, of, injury, to, the, corresponding, location, of, lesions, in, the, nervous, system, in, infectious, diseases, rhazes, differentiated, through, careful, observation, the, two, diseases, smallpox, and, measles, which, were, previously, lumped, together, as, a, single, disease, that, caused, rashes, this, was, based, on, location, and, the, time, of, the, appearance, of, the, symptoms, and, he, also, scaled, the, degree, of, severity, and, prognosis, of, infections, according, to, the, color, and, location, of, rashes, rhazes, who, was, once, asked, to, choose, the, site, for, a, new, hospital, in, baghdad, suspended, pieces, of, meat, at, various, points, around, the, city, and, recommended, building, the,

while, the, services, of, the, hospital, were, free, for, all, citizens, and, patients, were, sometimes, given, a, small, stipend, to, support, recovery, upon, discharge, individual, physicians, occasionally, charged, fees, in, a, notable, endowment, a, 13th, century, governor, of, egypt, al, mansur, qalawun, ordained, a, foundation, for, the, qalawun, hospital, that, would, contain, a,

and, payment, none, is, objected, to, or, even, indirectly, hinted, at, for, non, payment, arabic, scholars, used, their, natural, and, cultural, resources, to, contribute, to, the, strong, development, of, pharmacology, they, believed, that, god, had, provided, the, means, for, a, cure, for, every, disease, however, there, was, confusion, about, the, nature, of, some, ancient, plants, that, existed, during, this, time, a, prominent, figure, that, was, influential, in, the, development, of, pharmacy, used, the, name, yuhanna, ibn, masawaiyh, c, 777, 857, he, was, referred, to, as, the, divine, mesue, and, the, prince, of, medicine, by, european, scholars, masawaiyh, led, the, first, private, medical, school, in, baghdad, and, wrote, three, major, pharmaceutical, treatises, these, treatises, consisted, of, works, over, compound, medicines, humors, and, pharmaceutical, recipes, that, provided, instructions, on, how, they, were, to, be, prepared, in, the, latin, west, these, works, were, typically, published, together, under, the, title, opera, medicinalia, and, were, broken, up, into, de, simplicubus, grabadin, and, canones, universales, although, masawaiyh, s, influence, was, so, significant, that, his, writings, became, the, most, dominant, source, of, pharmaceutical, writings, his, exact, identity, remains, unclear, in, the, past, all, substances, that, were, to, be, introduced, into, on, or, near, the, human, body, were, labeled, as, medicine, ranging, from, drugs, food, beverages, even, perfumes, to, cosmetics, the, earliest, distinction, between, medicine, and, pharmacy, as, disciplines, began, in, the, seventh, century, when, pharmacists, and, apothecaries, appeared, in, the, first, hospitals, demand, for, drugs, increased, as, the, population, increased, by, the, ninth, century, where, pharmacy, was, established, as, an, independent, and, well, defined, profession, by, muslim, scholars, it, is, said, by, many, historians, that, the, opening, of, the, first, private, pharmacy, in, the, eighth, century, marks, the, independence, of, pharmacy, from, medicine, the, emergence, of, medicine, and, pharmacy, within, the, islamic, caliphate, by, the, ninth, century, occurred, at, the, same, time, as, rapid, expansion, of, many, scientific, institutions, libraries, schools, hospitals, and, then, pharmacies, in, many, muslim, cities, the, rise, of, alchemy, during, the, ninth, century, also, played, a, vital, role, for, early, pharmacological, development, while, arab, pharmacists, were, not, successful, in, converting, non, precious, metals, into, precious, metals, their, works, giving, details, of, techniques, and, lab, equipment, were, major, contributors, to, the, development, of, pharmacy, chemical, techniques, such, as, distillation, condensation, evaporation, and, pulverization, were, often, used, the, qur, an, provided, the, basis, for, the, development, of, professional, ethics, where, the, rise, of, ritual, washing, also, influenced, the, importance, of, hygiene, in, pharmacology, pharmacies, were, periodically, visited, by, government, inspectors, called, muhtasib, who, checked, to, see, that, the, medicines, were, mixed, properly, not, diluted, and, kept, in, clean, jars, work, done, by, the, muhtasib, was, carefully, outlined, in, manuals, that, explained, ways, of, examining, and, recognizing, falsified, drugs, foods, and, spices, it, was, forbidden, for, pharmacists, to, perform, medical, treatment, without, the, presence, of, a, physician, while, physicians, were, limited, to, the, preparation, and, handling, of, medications, it, was, feared, that, recipes, would, fall, into, the, hands, of, someone, without, the, proper, pharmaceutical, training, licenses, were,
