the, boers, and, hostile, to, the, british, even, within, the, uk, there, existed, significant, opposition, to, the, war, as, a, result, the, boer, cause, attracted, thousands, of, volunteers, from,

under, the, command, of, lord, roberts, the, british, launched, another, offensive, in, 1900, to, relieve, the, sieges, this, time, achieving, success, after, natal, and, the, cape, colony, were,

protracted, war, gradually, became, less, popular, especially, after, revelations, about, the, conditions, in, the, concentration, camps, where, as, many, as, 26, 000, afrikaner, women, and, children, died, of, disease, and, malnutrition, the, boer, forces, finally, surrendered, on, saturday, 31, may, 1902, with, 54, of, the, 60, delegates, from, the, transvaal, and, orange, free, state, voting, to, accept, the, terms, of, the, peace, treaty, 97, this, was, known, as, the, treaty, of, vereeniging, and, under, its, provisions, the, two, republics, were, absorbed, into, the, british, empire,

in, fact, according, to, a, 2011, bbc, report, most, scholars, prefer, to, call, the, war, of, 1899, 1902, the, south, african, war, thereby, acknowledging, that, all, south, africans, white, and, black, were, affected, by, the, war, and, that, many, were, participants, the, origins, of, the, war, were, complex, and, stemmed, from, more, than, a, century, of, conflict, between, the, boers, and, britain, of, immediate, importance, however, was, the, question, of, who, would, control, and, benefit, most, from, the, very, lucrative, witwatersrand, gold, mines, xxi, discovered, by, jan, gerrit, bantjes, in, june, 1884, the, first, european, settlement, in, south, africa, was, founded, at, the, cape, of, good, hope, in, 1652, and, thereafter, administered, as, part, of, the, dutch, cape, colony, the, cape, was, governed, by, the, dutch, east, india, company, until, its, bankruptcy, in, the, late, 18th, century, and, was, thereafter, governed, directly, by, the, netherlands, as, a, result, of, political, turmoil, in, the, netherlands, the, british, occupied, the, cape, three, times, during, the, napoleonic, wars, and, the, occupation, became, permanent, after, british, forces, defeated, the, dutch, at, the, battle, of, blaauwberg, in, 1806, at, the, time, the, colony, was, home, to, about, 26, 000, colonists, settled, under, dutch, rule, a, relative, majority, represented, old, dutch, families, brought, to, the, cape, during, the, late, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, however, close, to, one, fourth, of, this, demographic, was, of, german, origin, and, one, sixth, of, french, huguenot, descent, cleavages, were, likelier, to, occur, along, socio, economic, rather, than, ethnic, lines, broadly, speaking, the, colonists, included, a, number, of, distinct, subgroups, including, the, boers, the, boers, were, itinerant, farmers, who, lived, on, the, colony, s, frontiers, seeking, better, pastures, for, their, livestock, many, were, dissatisfied, with, aspects, of, british, administration, in, particular, with, britain, s, abolition, of, slavery, on, 1, december, 1834, boers, who, used, forced, labor, would, have, been, unable, to, collect, compensation, for, their, slaves, between, 1836, and, 1852, many, elected, to, migrate, away, from, british, rule, in, what, became, known, as, the, great, trek, around, 15, 000, trekking, boers, departed, the, cape, colony, and, followed, the, eastern, coast, towards, natal, after, britain, annexed, natal, in, 1843, they, journeyed, farther, northwards, into, south, africa, s, vast, eastern, interior, there, they, established, two, independent, boer, republics, the, south, african, republic, 1852, also, known, as, the, transvaal, republic, and, the, orange, free, state, 1854, britain, recognised, the, two, boer, republics, in, 1852, and, 1854, but, attempted, british, annexation, of, the, transvaal, in, 1877, led, to, the, first, boer, war, in, 1880, 1881, after, britain, suffered, defeats, particularly, at, the, battle, of, majuba, hill, 1881, the, independence, of, the, two, republics, was, restored, subject, to, certain, conditions, however, relations, remained, uneasy, in, 1866, diamonds, were, discovered, at, kimberley, prompting, a, diamond, rush, and, a, massive, influx, of, foreigners, to, the, borders, of, the, orange, free, state, then, in, june, 1884, gold, was, discovered, in, the, witwatersrand, area, of, the, south, african, republic, by, jan, gerrit, bantjes, gold, made, the, transvaal, the, richest, nation, in, southern, africa, however, the, country, had, neither, the, manpower, nor, the, industrial, base, to, develop, the, resource, on, its, own, as, a, result, the, transvaal, reluctantly, acquiesced, to, the, immigration, of, uitlanders, foreigners, mainly, english, speaking, men, from, britain, who, came, to, the, boer, region, in, search, of, fortune, and, employment, as, a, result, the, number, of, uitlanders, in, the, transvaal, threatened, to, exceed, the, number, of, boers, precipitating, confrontations, between, the, boer, settlers, and, the, newer, non, boer, arrivals, britain, s, expansionist, ideas, notably, propagated, by, cecil, rhodes, as, well, as, disputes, over, uitlander, political, and, economic, rights, led, to, the, failed, jameson, raid, of, 1895, dr, leander, starr, jameson, who, led, the, raid, intended, to, encourage, an, uprising, of, the, uitlanders, in, johannesburg, however, the, uitlanders, did, not, take, up, arms, in, support, and, transvaal, government, forces, surrounded, the, column, and, captured, jameson, s, men, before, they, could, reach, johannesburg, 1, 5, as, tensions, escalated, political, manoeuvrings, and, negotiations, attempted, to, reach, compromise, on, the, issues, of, uitlanders, rights, within, the, south, african, republic, control, of, the, gold, mining, industry, and, britain, s, desire, to, incorporate, the, transvaal, and, the, orange, free, state, into, a, federation, under, british, control, given, the, british, origins, of, the, majority, of, uitlanders, and, the, ongoing, influx, of, new, uitlanders, into, johannesburg, the, boers, recognised, that, granting, full, voting, rights, to, the, uitlanders, would, eventually, result, in, the, loss, of, ethnic, boer, control, in, the, south, african, republic, the, june, 1899, negotiations, in, bloemfontein, failed, and, in, september, 1899, british, colonial, secretary, joseph, chamberlain, demanded, full, voting, rights, and, representation, for, the, uitlanders, residing, in, the, transvaal, paul, kruger, the, president, of, the, south, african, republic, issued, an, ultimatum, on, 9, october, 1899, giving, the, british, government, 48, hours, to, withdraw, all, their, troops, from, the, borders, of, both, the, transvaal, and, the, orange, free, state, failing, which, the, transvaal, allied, to, the, orange, free, state, would, declare, war, on, the, british, government, in, fact, kruger, had, ordered, commandos, to, the, natal, border, in, early, september, and, britain, had, only, troops, in, garrison, towns, far, from, the, border, the, british, government, rejected, the, south, african, republic, s, ultimatum, and, the, south, african, republic, and, orange, free, state, declared, war, on, britain, the, southern, part, of, the, african, continent, was, dominated, in, the, 19th, century, by, a, set, of, struggles, to, create, within, it, a, single, unified, state, in, 1868, britain, annexed, basutoland, in, the, drakensberg, mountains, following, an, appeal, from, moshoeshoe, i, the, king, of, the, sotho, people, who, sought, british, protection, against, the, boers, while, the, berlin, conference, of, 1884, 1885, sought, to, draw, boundaries, between, the, european, powers, african, possessions, it, also, set, the, stage, for, further, scrambles, britain, attempted, to, annex, first, the, south, african, republic, in, 1880, and, then, in, 1899, both, the, south, african, republic, and, the, orange, free, state, in, the, 1880s, bechuanaland, modern, botswana, became, the, object, of, a, dispute, between, the, germans, to, the, west, the, boers, to, the, east, and, britain, s, cape, colony, to, the, south, although, bechuanaland, had, no, economic, value, the, missionaries, road, passed, through, it, towards, territory, farther, north, after, the, germans, annexed, damaraland, and, namaqualand, modern, namibia, in, 1884, britain, annexed, bechuanaland, in, 1885, in, the, first, boer, war, of, 1880, 1881, the, boers, of, the, transvaal, republic, proved, skilful, fighters, in, resisting, britain, s, attempt, at, annexation, causing, a, series, of, british, defeats, the, british, government, of, william, ewart, gladstone, was, unwilling, to, become, mired, in, a, distant, war, requiring, substantial, troop, reinforcement, and, expense, for, what, was, perceived, at, the, time, to, be, a, minimal, return, an, armistice, ended, the, war, and, subsequently, a, peace, treaty, was, signed, with, the, transvaal, president, paul, kruger, in, june, 1884, british, imperial, interests, were, ignited, in, the, discovery, by, jan, gerrit, bantjes, of, what, would, prove, to, be, the, world, s, largest, deposit, of, gold, bearing, ore, at, an, outcrop, on, a, large, ridge, some, 69, km, 43, mi, south, of, the, boer, capital, at, pretoria, the, ridge, was, known, locally, as, the, witwatersrand, white, water, ridge, a, watershed, a, gold, rush, to, the, transvaal, brought, thousands, of, british, and, other, prospectors, and, settlers, from, around, the, globe, and, over, the, border, from, the, cape, colony, which, had, been, under, british, control, since, 1806, the, city, of, johannesburg, sprang, up, nearly, overnight, as, a, shanty, town, uitlanders, foreigners, white, outsiders, poured, in, and, settled, around, the, mines, the, influx, was, so, rapid, that, uitlanders, quickly, outnumbered, the, boers, in, johannesburg, and, along, the, rand, although, they, remained, a, minority, in, the, transvaal, the, boers, nervous, and, resentful, of, the, uitlanders, growing, presence, sought, to, contain, their, influence, through, requiring, lengthy, residential, qualifying, periods, before, voting, rights, could, be, obtained, by, imposing, taxes, on, the, gold, industry, and, by, introducing, controls, through, licensing, tariffs, and, administrative, requirements, among, the, issues, giving, rise, to, tension, between, the, transvaal, government, on, the, one, hand, and, the, uitlanders, and, british, interests, on, the, other, were, british, imperial, interests, were, alarmed, when, in, 1894, 1895, kruger, proposed, building, a, railway, through, portuguese, east, africa, to, delagoa, bay, bypassing, british, controlled, ports, in, natal, and, cape, town, and, avoiding, british, tariffs, at, the, time, the, prime, minister, of, the, cape, colony, was, cecil, rhodes, a, man, driven, by, a, vision, of, a, british, controlled, africa, extending, from, the, cape, to, cairo, certain, self, appointed, uitlanders, representatives, and, british, mine, owners, became, increasingly, frustrated, and, angered, by, their, dealings, with, the, transvaal, government, a, reform, committee, transvaal, was, formed, to, represent, the, uitlanders, in, 1895, a, plan, to, take, johannesburg, and, end, the, control, of, the, transvaal, government, was, hatched, with, the, connivance, of, the, cape, prime, minister, rhodes, and, johannesburg, gold, magnate, alfred, beit, a, column, of, 600, armed, men, was, led, over, the, border, from, bechuanaland, towards, johannesburg, by, jameson, the, administrator, in, rhodesia, of, the, british, south, africa, company, of, which, cecil, rhodes, was, the, chairman, the, column, mainly, made, up, of, rhodesian, and, bechuanaland, british, south, africa, policemen, was, equipped, with, maxim, machine, guns, and, some, artillery, pieces, the, plan, was, to, make, a, three, day, dash, to, johannesburg, and, trigger, an, uprising, by, the, primarily, british, expatriate, uitlanders, organised, by, the, johannesburg, reform, committee, before, the, boer, commandos, could, mobilise, however, the, transvaal, authorities, had, advance, warning, of, the, jameson, raid, and, tracked, it, from, the, moment, it, crossed, the, border, four, days, later, the, weary, and, dispirited, column, was, surrounded, near, krugersdorp, within, sight, of, johannesburg, after, a, brief, skirmish, in, which, the, column, lost, 65, killed, and, wounded, while, the, boers, lost, but, one, man, jameson, s, men, surrendered, and, were, arrested, by, the, boers, 1, 5, the, botched, raid, had, repercussions, throughout, southern, africa, and, in, europe, in, rhodesia, the, departure, of, so, many, policemen, enabled, the, matabele, and, mashona, peoples, rising, against, the, british, south, africa, company, the, rebellion, known, as, the, second, matabele, war, was, suppressed, only, at, a, great, cost, a, few, days, after, the, raid, the, german, kaiser, sent, a, telegram, known, to, history, as, the, kruger, telegram, congratulating, president, kruger, and, the, government, of, the, south, african, republic, on, their, success, when, the, text, of, this, telegram, was, disclosed, in, the, british, press, it, generated, a, storm, of, anti, german, feeling, in, the, baggage, of, the, raiding, column, to, the, great, embarrassment, of, britain, the, boers, found, telegrams, from, cecil, rhodes, and, the, other, plotters, in, johannesburg, chamberlain, had, approved, rhodes, plans, to, send, armed, assistance, in, the, case, of, a, johannesburg, uprising, but, he, quickly, moved, to, condemn, the, raid, rhodes, was, severely, censured, at, the, cape, inquiry, and, the, london, parliamentary, inquiry, and, was, forced, to, resign, as, prime, minister, of, the, cape, and, as, chairman, of, the, british, south, africa, company, for, having, sponsored, the, failed, coup, d, tat, the, boer, government, handed, their, prisoners, over, to, the, british, for, trial, jameson, was, tried, in, england, where, the, british, press, and, london, society, inflamed, by, anti, boer, and, anti, german, feeling, and, in, a, frenzy, of, jingoism, lionised, him, and, treated, him, as, a, hero, although, sentenced, to, 15, months, imprisonment, which, he, served, in, holloway, jameson, was, later, rewarded, by, being, named, prime, minister, of, the, cape, colony, 1904, 1908, and, was, ultimately, anointed, as, one, of, the, founders, of, the, union, of, south, africa, for, conspiring, with, jameson, the, uitlander, members, of, the, reform, committee, transvaal, were, tried, in, the, transvaal, courts, and, found, guilty, of, high, treason, the, four, leaders, were, sentenced, to, death, by, hanging, but, the, next, day, this, sentence, was, commuted, to, 15, years, imprisonment, in, june, 1896, the, other, members, of, the, committee, were, released, on, payment, of, 2, 000, each, in, fines, all, of, which, were, paid, by, cecil, rhodes, one, reform, committee, member, frederick, gray, committed, suicide, while, in, pretoria, gaol, on, 16, may, his, death, was, a, factor, in, softening, the, transvaal, government, s, attitude, to, the, surviving, prisoners,

their, alliance, the, defenders, on, the, other, hand, silently, and, grimly, prepared, for, the, inevitable, 9, the, jameson, raid, alienated, many, cape, afrikaners, from, britain, and, united, the, transvaal, boers, behind, president, kruger, and, his, government, it, also, had, the, effect, of, drawing, the, transvaal, and, the, orange, free, state, led, by, president, martinus, theunis, steyn, together, in, opposition, to, british, imperialism, in, 1897, the, two, republics, concluded, a, military, pact, in, earlier, conflicts, the, boers, most, common, weapon, was, the, british, westley,

lee, metfords, regardless, of, the, rifle, few, of, the, boers, used, bayonets, the, boers, also, purchased, the, best, modern, european, german, krupp, artillery, by, october, 1899, the, transvaal, state, artillery, had, 73, heavy, guns, including, four, 155, mm, creusot, fortress, guns, and, 25, of, the, 37, mm, maxim, nordenfeldt, guns, 80, the, boers, maxim, larger, than, the, british, maxims, was, a, large, calibre, belt, fed, water, cooled, auto, cannon, that, fired, explosive, rounds, smokeless, ammunition, at, 450, rounds, per, minute, it, became, known, as, the, pom, pom, aside, from, weaponry, the, tactics, used, by, the, boers, were, significant, as, one, modern, source, states, boer, soldiers, were, adept, at, guerrilla, warfare, something, the, british, had, difficulty, countering, the, transvaal, army, was, transformed, approximately, 25, 000, men, equipped, with, modern, rifles, and, artillery, could, mobilise, within, two, weeks, however, president, kruger, s, victory, in, the, jameson, raid, incident, did, nothing, to, resolve, the, fundamental, problem, of, finding, a, formula, to, conciliate, the, uitlanders, without, surrendering, the, independence, of, the, transvaal, the, failure, to, gain, improved, rights, for, uitlanders, notably, the, goldfields, dynamite, tax, became, a, pretext, for, war, and, a, justification, for, a, big, military, build, up, in, cape, colony, the, case, for, war, was, developed, and, espoused, as, far, away, as, the, australian, colonies, cape, colony, governor, sir, alfred, milner, rhodes, chamberlain, and, mining, syndicate, owners, such, as, beit, barney, barnato, and, lionel, phillips, favoured, annexation, of, the, boer, republics, confident, that, the, boers, would, be, quickly, defeated, they, planned, and, organised, a, short, war, citing, the, uitlanders, grievances, as, the, motivation, for, the, conflict, in, contrast, the, influence, of, the, war, party, within, the, british, government, was, limited, uk, prime, minister, lord, salisbury, despised, jingoism, and, jingoists, he, was, also, uncertain, of, the, abilities, of, the, british, army, despite, both, his, moral, and, practical, reservations, salisbury, led, the, united, kingdom, to, war, in, order, to, preserve, the, british, empire, s, prestige, and, feeling, a, sense, of, obligation, to, british, south, africans, salisbury, also, detested, the, boers, treatment, of, native, africans, referring, to, the, london, convention, of, 1884, following, britain, s, defeat, in, the, first, war, as, an, agreement, really, in, the, interest, of, slavery, 7, 6, salisbury, was, not, alone, in, this, concern, roger, casement, already, well, on, the, way, to, becoming, an, irish, nationalist, was, nevertheless, happy, to, gather, intelligence, for, the, british, against, the, boers, because, of, their, cruelty, to, africans, the, british, government, went, against, the, advice, of, its, generals, including, wolseley, and, declined, to, send, substantial, reinforcements, to, south, africa, before, war, broke, out, secretary, of, state, for, war, lansdowne, did, not, believe, the, boers, were, preparing, for, war, and, that, if, britain, were, to, send, large, numbers, of, troops, to, the, region, it, would, strike, too, aggressive, a, posture, and, possibly, derail, a, negotiated, settlement, or, even, encourage, a, boer, attack, steyn, of, the, orange, free, state, invited, milner, and, kruger, to, attend, a, conference, in, bloemfontein, the, conference, started, on, 30, may, 1899, but, negotiations, quickly, broke, down, as, kruger, had, no, intention, of, granting, meaningful, concessions, 91, and, milner, had, no, intention, of, accepting, his, normal, delaying, tactics, on, 9, october, 1899, after, convincing, the, orange, free, state, to, join, him, and, mobilising, their, forces, kruger, issued, an, ultimatum, giving, britain, 48, hours, to, withdraw, all, their, troops, from, the, border, of, transvaal, despite, the, fact, that, the, only, regular, british, army, troops, anywhere, near, the, border, of, either, republic, were, 4, companies, of, the, loyal, north, lancs, who, had, been, deployed, to, defend, kimberley, 14, otherwise, the, transvaal, allied, with, the, orange, free, state, would, declare, war, news, of, the, ultimatum, reached, london, on, the, day, it, expired, outrage, and, laughter, were, the, main, responses, the, editor, of, the, times, purportedly, laughed, out, loud, when, he, read, it, saying, an, official, document, is, seldom, amusing, and, useful, yet, this, was, both, the, times, denounced, the, ultimatum, as, an, extravagant, farce, and, the, globe, denounced, this, trumpery, little, state, most, editorials, were, similar, to, the, daily, telegraph, s, which, declared, of, course, there, can, only, be, one, answer, to, this, grotesque, challenge, kruger, has, asked, for, war, and, war, he, must, have, such, views, were, far, from, those, of, the, british, government, and, from, those, in, the, army, to, most, sensible, observers, army, reform, had, been, a, matter, of, pressing, concern, since, the, 1870s, constantly, put, off, because, the, british, public, did, not, want, the, expense, of, a, larger, more, professional, army, and, because, a, large, home, army, was, not, politically, welcome, lord, salisbury, the, prime, minister, had, to, tell, a, surprised, queen, victoria, that, we, have, no, army, capable, of, meeting, even, a, second, class, continental, power, 4, when, war, with, the, boer, republics, was, imminent, in, september, 1899, a, field, force, referred, to, as, the, army, corps, sometimes, 1st, army, corps, was, mobilised, and, sent, to, cape, town, it, was, about, the, equivalent, of, the, i, army, corps, of, the, existing, mobilization, scheme, and, was, placed, under, the, command, of, gen, sir, redvers, buller, general, officer, commanding, in, chief, of, aldershot, command, in, south, africa, the, corps, never, operated, as, such, and, the, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, divisions, were, widely, dispersed, war, was, declared, on, 11, october, 1899, with, a, boer, offensive, into, the, british, held, natal, and, cape, colony, areas, the, boers, had, about, 33, 000, soldiers, and, decisively, outnumbered, the, british, who, could, move, only, 13, 000, troops, to, the, front, line, the, boers, had, no, problems, with, mobilisation, since, the, fiercely, independent, boers, had, no, regular, army, units, apart, from, the, staatsartillerie, dutch, for, state, artillery, of, both, republics, as, with, the, first, boer, war, since, most, of, the, boers, were, members, of, civilian, militias, none, had, adopted, uniforms, or, insignia, only, the, members, of, the, staatsartillerie, wore, light, green, uniforms, when, danger, loomed, all, the, burgers, citizens, in, a, district, would, form, a, military, unit, called, a, commando, and, would, elect, officers, a, full, time, official, called, a, veldkornet, maintained, muster, rolls, but, had, no, disciplinary, powers, each, man, brought, his, own, weapon, usually, a, hunting, rifle, and, his, own, horse, those, who, could, not, afford, a, gun, were, given, one, by, the, authorities, 80, the, presidents, of, the, transvaal, and, orange, free, state, simply, signed, decrees, to, concentrate, within, a, week, and, the, commandos, could, muster, between, 30, 000, and, 40, 000, men, 56, the, average, boer, nevertheless, was, not, thirsty, for, war, many, did, not, look, forward, to, fighting, against, fellow, christians, and, by, and, large, fellow, protestants, many, may, have, had, an, overly, optimistic, sense, of, what, the, war, would, involve, imagining, that, victory, could, be, achieved, as, fast, and, easily, as, it, had, been, in, the, first, anglo, boer, war, 74, many, including, many, generals, also, had, a, sense, that, their, cause, was, holy, and, just, and, blessed, by, god, 179, it, rapidly, became, clear, that, the, boer, forces, presented, the, british, forces, with, a, severe, tactical, challenge, what, the, boers, presented, was, a, mobile, and, innovative, approach, to, warfare, drawing, on, their, experiences, from, the, first, boer, war, the, average, boers, who, made, up, their, commandos, were, farmers, who, had, spent, almost, all, their, working, life, in, the, saddle, both, as, farmers, and, hunters, they, depended, on, the, pot, horse, and, rifle, they, were, also, skilled, stalkers, and, marksmen, as, hunters, they, had, learned, to, fire, from, cover, from, a, prone, position, and, to, make, the, first, shot, count, knowing, that, if, they, missed, the, game, would, either, be, long, gone, or, could, charge, and, potentially, kill, them, at, community, gatherings, target, shooting, was, a, major, sport, they, practised, shooting, at, targets, such, as, hens, eggs, perched, on, posts, 100, metres, 110, yd, away, they, made, expert, mounted, infantry, using, every, scrap, of, cover, from, which, they, could, pour, in, a, destructive, fire, using, modern, smokeless, mauser, rifles, in, preparation, for, hostilities, the, boers, had, acquired, around, one, hundred, of, the, latest, krupp, field, guns, all, horse, drawn, and, dispersed, among, the, various, kommando, groups, and, several, le, creusot, long, tom, siege, guns, the, boers, skill, in, adapting, themselves, to, become, first, rate, artillerymen, shows, that, they, were, a, versatile, adversary, 30, the, transvaal, also, had, an, intelligence, service, that, stretched, across, south, africa, and, of, whose, extent, and, efficiency, the, british, were, as, yet, unaware, 81, the, boers, struck, first, on, 12, october, at, the, battle, of, kraaipan, an, attack, that, heralded, the, invasion, of, the, cape, colony, and, natal, between, october, 1899, and, january, 1900, 20, with, speed, and, surprise, the, boers, drove, quickly, towards, the, british, garrison, at, ladysmith, and, the, smaller, ones, at, mafeking, and, kimberley, the, quick, boer, mobilisation, resulted, in, early, military, successes, against, scattered, british, forces, sir, george, stuart, white, commanding, the, british, division, at, ladysmith, unwisely, allowed, major, general, penn, symons, to, throw, a, brigade, forward, to, the, coal, mining, town, of, dundee, also, reported, as, glencoe, which, was, surrounded, by, hills, this, became, the, site, of, the, first, major, clash, of, the, war, the, battle, of, talana, hill, boer, guns, began, shelling, the, british, camp, from, the, summit, of, talana, hill, at, dawn, on, 20, october, penn, symons, immediately, counter, attacked, his, infantry, drove, the, boers, from, the, hill, for, the, loss, of, 446, british, casualties, including, penn, symons, another, boer, force, occupied, elandslaagte, which, lay, between, ladysmith, and, dundee, the, british, under, major, general, john, french, and, colonel, ian, hamilton, attacked, to, clear, the, line, of, communications, to, dundee, the, resulting, battle, of, elandslaagte, was, a, clear, cut, british, tactical, victory, 29, but, sir, george, white, feared, that, more, boers, were, about, to, attack, his, main, position, and, so, ordered, a, chaotic, retreat, from, elandslaagte, throwing, away, any, advantage, gained, the, detachment, from, dundee, was, compelled, to, make, an, exhausting, cross, country, retreat, to, rejoin, white, s, main, force, as, boers, surrounded, ladysmith, and, opened, fire, on, the, town, with, siege, guns, white, ordered, a, major, sortie, against, their, positions, 33, the, result, was, a, disaster, with, 140, men, killed, and, over, 1, 000, captured, the, siege, of, ladysmith, began, it, was, to, last, several, months, meanwhile, to, the, north, west, at, mafeking, on, the, border, with, transvaal, colonel, robert, baden, powell, had, raised, two, regiments, of, local, forces, amounting, to, about, 1, 200, men, in, order, to, attack, and, create, diversions, if, things, went, amiss, further, south, as, a, railway, junction, mafeking, provided, good, supply, facilities, and, was, the, obvious, place, for, baden, powell, to, fortify, in, readiness, for, such, attacks, however, instead, of, being, the, aggressor, baden, powell, was, forced, to, defend, mafeking, when, 6, 000, boer, commanded, by, piet, cronj, attempted, a, determined, assault, on, the, town, this, quickly, subsided, into, a, desultory, affair, with, the, boers, prepared, to, starve, the, stronghold, into, submission, so, on, 13, october, the, 217, day, siege, of, mafeking, began, lastly, over, 360, kilometres, 220, mi, to, the, south, of, mafeking, lay, the, diamond, mining, city, of, kimberley, which, was, also, subjected, to, a, siege, although, not, militarily, significant, it, nonetheless, represented, an, enclave, of, british, imperialism, on, the, borders, of, the, orange, free, state, and, was, hence, an, important, boer, objective, in, early, november, about, 7, 500, boer, began, their, siege, again, content, to, starve, the, town, into, submission, despite, boer, shelling, the, 40, 000, inhabitants, of, which, only, 5, 000, were, armed, were, under, little, threat, because, the, town, was, well, stocked, with, provisions, the, garrison, was, commanded, by, lieutenant, colonel, robert, kekewich, although, rhodes, was, also, a, prominent, figure, in, the, town, s, defences, siege, life, took, its, toll, on, both, the, defending, soldiers, and, the, civilians, in, the, cities, of, mafeking, ladysmith, and, kimberley, as, food, began, to, grow, scarce, after, a, few, weeks, in, mafeking, sol, plaatje, wrote, i, saw, horseflesh, for, the, first, time, being, treated, as, a, human, foodstuff, the, cities, under, siege, also, dealt, with, constant, artillery, bombardment, making, the, streets, a, dangerous, place, near, the, end, of, the, siege, of, kimberley, it, was, expected, that, the, boers, would, intensify, their, bombardment, so, rhodes, displayed, a, notice, encouraging, people, to, go, down, into, shafts, of, the, kimberley, mine, for, protection, the, townspeople, panicked, and, people, surged, into, the, mineshafts, constantly, for, a, 12, hour, period, although, the, bombardment, never, came, this, did, nothing, to, diminish, the, anxious, civilians, distress, the, most, well, heeled, of, the, townspeople, including, cecil, rhodes, sheltered, in, the, sanatorium, site, of, the, present, day, mcgregor, museum, the, poorer, residents, notably, the, black, population, did, not, have, any, shelter, from, shelling, in, retrospect, the, boers, decision, to, commit, themselves, to, sieges, sitzkrieg, was, a, mistake, and, one, of, the, best, illustrations, of, their, lack, of, strategic, vision, historically, it, had, little, in, its, favour, of, the, seven, sieges, in, the, first, boer, war, the, boers, had, prevailed, in, none, more, importantly, it, handed, the, initiative, back, to, the, british, and, allowed, them, time, to, recover, which, they, did, generally, speaking, throughout, the, campaign, the, boers, were, too, defensive, and, passive, wasting, the, opportunities, they, had, for, victory, yet, that, passivity, also, testified, to, the, fact, that, they, had, no, desire, to, conquer, british, territory, but, only, to, preserve, their, ability, to, rule, in, their, own, territory, 82, 85, on, 31, october, 1899, general, sir, redvers, henry, buller, a, much, respected, commander, arrived, in, south, africa, with, the, army, corps, made, up, of, the, 1st, 2nd, and, 3rd, divisions, buller, originally, intended, an, offensive, straight, up, the, railway, line, leading, from, cape, town, through, bloemfontein, to, pretoria, finding, on, arrival, that, the, british, troops, already, in, south, africa, were, under, siege, he, split, his, army, corps, into, detachments, to, relieve, the, besieged, garrisons, one, division, led, by, lieutenant, general, lord, methuen, was, to, follow, the, western, railway, to, the, north, and, relieve, kimberley, and, mafeking, a, smaller, force, of, about, 3, 000, led, by, major, general, william, gatacre, was, to, push, north, towards, the, railway, junction, at, stormberg, and, secure, the, cape, midlands, district, from, boer, raids, and, local, rebellions, by, boer, inhabitants, buller, led, the, major, part, of, the, army, corps, to, relieve, ladysmith, to, the, east, the, initial, results, of, this, offensive, were, mixed, with, methuen, winning, several, bloody, skirmishes, in, the, battle, of, belmont, on, 23, november, the, battle, of, graspan, on, 25, november, and, at, a, larger, engagement, the, battle, of, modder, river, on, 28, november, resulting, in, british, losses, of, 71, dead, and, over, 400, wounded, british, commanders, had, been, trained, on, the, lessons, of, the, crimean, war, and, were, adept, at, battalion, and, regimental, set, pieces, with, columns, manoeuvring, in, jungles, deserts, and, mountainous, regions, what, british, generals, failed, to, comprehend, was, the, impact, of, destructive, fire, from, trench, positions, and, the, mobility, of, cavalry, raids, the, british, troops, went, to, war, with, what, would, prove, to, be, antiquated, tactics, and, in, some, cases, antiquated, weapons, against, the, mobile, boer, forces, with, the, destructive, fire, of, their, modern, mausers, the, latest, krupp, field, guns, and, their, novel, tactics, the, middle, of, december, was, disastrous, for, the, british, army, in, a, period, known, as, black, week, 10, 15, december, 1899, the, british, suffered, defeats, on, each, of, the, three, fronts, on, 10, december, general, gatacre, tried, to, recapture, stormberg, railway, junction, about, 80, kilometres, 50, mi, south, of, the, orange, river, gatacre, s, attack, was, marked, by, administrative, and, tactical, blunders, and, the, battle, of, stormberg, ended, in, a, british, defeat, with, 135, killed, and, wounded, and, two, guns, and, over, 600, troops, captured, at, the, battle, of, magersfontein, on, 11, december, methuen, s, 14, 000, british, troops, attempted, to, capture, a, boer, position, in, a, dawn, attack, to, relieve, kimberley, this, too, turned, into, a, disaster, when, the, highland, brigade, became, pinned, down, by, accurate, boer, fire, after, suffering, from, intense, heat, and, thirst, for, nine, hours, they, eventually, broke, in, ill, disciplined, retreat, the, boer, commanders, koos, de, la, rey, and, cronj, had, ordered, trenches, to, be, dug, in, an, unconventional, place, to, fool, the, british, and, to, give, their, riflemen, a, greater, firing, range, the, plan, worked, and, this, tactic, helped, to, write, the, doctrine, of, the, supremacy, of, the, defensive, position, using, modern, small, arms, and, trench, fortifications, the, british, lost, 120, killed, and, 690, wounded, and, were, prevented, from, relieving, kimberley, and, mafeking, a, british, soldier, said, of, the, defeat, such, was, the, day, for, our, regiment, dread, the, revenge, we, will, take, dearly, we, paid, for, the, blunder, a, drawing, room, general, s, mistake, why, weren, t, we, told, of, the, trenches, why, weren, t, we, told, of, the, wire, why, were, we, marched, up, in, column, may, tommy, atkins, enquire, the, nadir, of, black, week, was, the, battle, of, colenso, on, 15, december, where, 21, 000, british, troops, commanded, by, buller, attempted, to, cross, the, tugela, river, to, relieve, ladysmith, where, 8, 000, transvaal, boers, under, the, command, of, louis, botha, were, waiting, for, them, through, a, combination, of, artillery, and, accurate, rifle, fire, and, better, use, of, the, ground, the, boers, repelled, all, british, attempts, to, cross, the, river, after, his, first, attacks, failed, buller, broke, off, the, battle, and, ordered, a, retreat, abandoning, many, wounded, men, several, isolated, units, and, ten, field, guns, to, be, captured, by, botha, s, men, buller, s, forces, lost, 145, men, killed, and, 1, 200, missing, or, wounded, and, the, boers, suffered, only, 40, casualties, including, 8, killed, 12, lay, now, calm, and, innocent, with, its, open, windows, looking, out, upon, a, smiling, garden, but, death, lurked, at, the, windows, and, death, in, the, garden, and, the, little, dark, man, who, stood, by, the, door, peering, through, his, glass, at, the, approaching, column, was, the, minister, of, death, the, dangerous, cronje, arthur, conan, doyle, the, great, boer, war, 1900, the, british, government, took, these, defeats, badly, and, with, the, sieges, still, continuing, was, compelled, to, send, two, more, divisions, plus, large, numbers, of, colonial, volunteers, by, january, 1900, this, would, become, the, largest, force, britain, had, ever, sent, overseas, amounting, to, some, 180, 000, men, with, further, reinforcements, being, sought, while, watching, for, these, reinforcements, buller, made, another, bid, to, relieve, ladysmith, by, crossing, the, tugela, west, of, colenso, buller, s, subordinate, major, general, charles, warren, successfully, crossed, the, river, but, was, then, faced, with, a, fresh, defensive, position, centred, on, a, prominent, hill, known, as, spion, kop, in, the, resulting, battle, of, spion, kop, british, troops, captured, the, summit, by, surprise, during, the, early, hours, of, 24, january, 1900, but, as, the, early, morning, fog, lifted, they, realised, too, late, that, they, were, overlooked, by, boer, gun, emplacements, on, the, surrounding, hills, the, rest, of, the, day, resulted, in, a, disaster, caused, by, poor, communication, between, buller, and, his, commanders, between, them, they, issued, contradictory, orders, on, the, one, hand, ordering, men, off, the, hill, while, other, officers, ordered, fresh, reinforcements, to, defend, it, the, result, was, 350, men, killed, and, nearly, 1, 000, wounded, and, a, retreat, across, the, tugela, river, into, british, territory, there, were, nearly, 300, boer, casualties, buller, attacked, louis, botha, again, on, 5, february, at, vaal, krantz, and, was, again, defeated, buller, withdrew, early, when, it, appeared, that, the, british, would, be, isolated, in, an, exposed, bridgehead, across, the, tugela, for, which, he, was, nicknamed, sir, reverse, by, some, of, his, officers, by, taking, command, in, person, in, natal, buller, had, allowed, the, overall, direction, of, the, war, to, drift, because, of, concerns, about, his, performance, and, negative, reports, from, the, field, he, was, replaced, as, commander, in, chief, by, roberts, roberts, quickly, assembled, an, entirely, new, team, for, headquarters, staff, and, he, chose, military, men, from, far, and, wide, kitchener, chief, of, staff, from, the, sudan, frederick, russell, burnham, chief, of, scouts, the, american, scout, from, the, klondike, george, henderson, from, the, staff, college, neville, bowles, chamberlain, from, afghanistan, and, william, nicholson, military, secretary, from, calcutta, like, buller, roberts, first, intended, to, attack, directly, along, the, cape, town, pretoria, railway, but, again, like, buller, was, forced, to, relieve, the, beleaguered, garrisons, leaving, buller, in, command, in, natal, roberts, massed, his, main, force, near, the, orange, river, and, along, the, western, railway, behind, methuen, s, force, at, the, modder, river, and, prepared, to, make, a, wide, outflanking, move, to, relieve, kimberley, except, in, natal, the, war, had, stagnated, other, than, a, single, attempt, to, storm, ladysmith, the, boers, made, no, attempt, to, capture, the, besieged, towns, in, the, cape, midlands, the, boers, did, not, exploit, the, british, defeat, at, stormberg, and, were, prevented, from, capturing, the, railway, junction, at, colesberg, in, the, dry, summer, the, grazing, on, the, veld, became, parched, weakening, the, boers, horses, and, draught, oxen, and, many, boer, families, joined, their, menfolk, in, the, siege, lines, and, laagers, encampments, fatally, encumbering, cronj, s, army, roberts, launched, his, main, attack, on, 10, february, 1900, and, although, hampered, by, a, long, supply, route, managed, to, outflank, the, boers, defending, magersfontein, on, 14, february, a, cavalry, division, under, french, launched, a, major, attack, to, relieve, kimberley, although, encountering, severe, fire, a, massed, cavalry, charge, split, the, boer, defences, on, 15, february, opening, the, way, for, french, to, enter, kimberley, that, evening, ending, its, 124, days, siege, meanwhile, roberts, pursued, piet, cronj, s, 7, 000, strong, force, which, had, abandoned, magersfontein, to, head, for, bloemfontein, general, french, s, cavalry, was, ordered, to, assist, in, the, pursuit, by, embarking, on, an, epic, 50, km, 31, mi, drive, towards, paardeberg, where, cronj, was, attempting, to, cross, the, modder, river, at, the, battle, of, paardeberg, from, 18, to, 27, february, roberts, then, surrounded, cronj, s, retreating, boer, army, on, 17, february, a, pincer, movement, involving, both, french, s, cavalry, and, the, main, british, force, attempted, to, take, the, entrenched, position, but, the, frontal, attacks, were, uncoordinated, and, so, were, repulsed, by, the, boers, finally, roberts, resorted, to, bombarding, cronj, into, submission, it, took, ten, days, and, when, the, british, troops, used, the, polluted, modder, river, as, water, supply, typhoid, killed, many, troops, general, cronj, was, forced, to, surrender, at, surrender, hill, with, 4, 000, men, in, natal, the, battle, of, the, tugela, heights, which, started, on, 14, february, was, buller, s, fourth, attempt, to, relieve, ladysmith, the, losses, buller, s, troops, had, sustained, convinced, buller, to, adopt, boer, tactics, in, the, firing, line, to, advance, in, small, rushes, covered, by, rifle, fire, from, behind, to, use, the, tactical, support, of, artillery, and, above, all, to, use, the, ground, making, rock, and, earth, work, for, them, as, it, did, for, the, enemy, despite, reinforcements, his, progress, was, painfully, slow, against, stiff, opposition, however, on, 26, february, after, much, deliberation, buller, used, all, his, forces, in, one, all, out, attack, for, the, first, time, and, at, last, succeeded, in, forcing, a, crossing, of, the, tugela, to, defeat, botha, s, outnumbered, forces, north, of, colenso, after, a, siege, lasting, 118, days, the, relief, of, ladysmith, was, effected, the, day, after, cronj, surrendered, but, at, a, total, cost, of, 7, 000, british, casualties, buller, s, troops, marched, into, ladysmith, on, 28, february, after, a, succession, of, defeats, the, boers, realised, that, against, such, overwhelming, numbers, of, troops, they, had, little, chance, of, defeating, the, british, and, so, became, demoralised, roberts, then, advanced, into, the, orange, free, state, from, the, west, putting, the, boers, to, flight, at, the, battle, of, poplar, grove, and, capturing, bloemfontein, the, capital, unopposed, on, 13, march, with, the, boer, defenders, escaping, and, scattering, meanwhile, he, detached, a, small, force, to, relieve, baden, powell, the, relief, of, mafeking, on, 18, may, 1900, provoked, riotous, celebrations, in, britain, the, origin, of, the, edwardian, slang, word, mafficking, on, 28, may, the, orange, free, state, was, annexed, and, renamed, the, orange, river, colony, after, being, forced, to, delay, for, several, weeks, at, bloemfontein, by, a, shortage, of, supplies, an, outbreak, of, typhoid, at, paardeberg, and, poor, medical, care, roberts, finally, resumed, his, advance, he, was, forced, to, halt, again, at, kroonstad, for, 10, days, due, once, again, to, the, collapse, of, his, medical, and, supply, systems, but, finally, captured, johannesburg, on, 31, may, and, the, capital, of, the, transvaal, pretoria, on, 5, june, the, first, into, pretoria, was, lt, william, watson, of, the, new, south, wales, mounted, rifles, who, persuaded, the, boers, to, surrender, the, capital, before, the, war, the, boers, had, constructed, several, forts, south, of, pretoria, but, the, artillery, had, been, removed, from, the, forts, for, use, in, the, field, and, in, the, event, they, abandoned, pretoria, without, a, fight, having, won, the, principal, cities, roberts, declared, the, war, over, on, 3, september, 1900, and, the, south, african, republic, was, formally, annexed, british, observers, believed, the, war, to, be, all, but, over, after, the, capture, of, the, two, capital, cities, however, the, boers, had, earlier, met, at, the, temporary, new, capital, of, the, orange, free, state, kroonstad, and, planned, a, guerrilla, campaign, to, hit, the, british, supply, and, communication, lines, the, first, engagement, of, this, new, form, of, warfare, was, at, sanna, s, post, on, 31, march, where, 1, 500, boers, under, the, command, of, christiaan, de, wet, attacked, bloemfontein, s, waterworks, about, 37, kilometres, 23, mi, east, of, the, city, and, ambushed, a, heavily, escorted, convoy, which, caused, 155, british, casualties, and, the, capture, of, seven, guns, 117, wagons, and, 428, british, troops, after, the, fall, of, pretoria, one, of, the, last, formal, battles, was, at, diamond, hill, on, 11, 12, june, where, roberts, attempted, to, drive, the, remnants, of, the, boer, field, army, under, botha, beyond, striking, distance, of, pretoria, although, roberts, drove, the, boers, from, the, hill, botha, did, not, regard, it, as, a, defeat, for, he, inflicted, 162, casualties, on, the, british, while, suffering, only, around, 50, casualties, the, set, piece, period, of, the, war, now, largely, gave, way, to, a, mobile, guerrilla, war, but, one, final, operation, remained, president, kruger, and, what, remained, of, the, transvaal, government, had, retreated, to, eastern, transvaal, roberts, joined, by, troops, from, natal, under, buller, advanced, against, them, and, broke, their, last, defensive, position, at, bergendal, on, 26, august, as, roberts, and, buller, followed, up, along, the, railway, line, to, komatipoort, kruger, sought, asylum, in, portuguese, east, africa, modern, mozambique, some, dispirited, boers, did, likewise, and, the, british, gathered, up, much, war, material, however, the, core, of, the, boer, fighters, under, botha, easily, broke, back, through, the, drakensberg, mountains, into, the, transvaal, highveld, after, riding, north, through, the, bushveld, as, roberts, s, army, occupied, pretoria, the, boer, fighters, in, the, orange, free, state, retreated, into, the, brandwater, basin, a, fertile, area, in, the, south, east, of, the, republic, this, offered, only, temporary, sanctuary, as, the, mountain, passes, leading, to, it, could, be, occupied, by, the, british, trapping, the, boers, a, force, under, general, archibald, hunter, set, out, from, bloemfontein, to, achieve, this, in, july, 1900, the, hard, core, of, the, free, state, boers, under, de, wet, accompanied, by, president, steyn, left, the, basin, early, those, remaining, fell, into, confusion, and, most, failed, to, break, out, before, hunter, trapped, them, 4, 500, boers, surrendered, and, much, equipment, was, captured, but, as, with, roberts, s, drive, against, kruger, at, the, same, time, these, losses, were, of, relatively, little, consequence, as, the, hard, core, of, the, boer, armies, and, their, most, determined, and, active, leaders, remained, at, large, from, the, basin, christiaan, de, wet, headed, west, although, hounded, by, british, columns, he, succeeded, in, crossing, the, vaal, into, western, transvaal, to, allow, steyn, to, travel, to, meet, their, leaders, there, was, much, sympathy, for, the, boers, on, mainland, europe, in, october, president, kruger, and, members, of, the, transvaal, government, left, portuguese, east, africa, on, the, dutch, warship, de, gelderland, sent, by, the, queen, wilhelmina, of, the, netherlands, paul, kruger, s, wife, however, was, too, ill, to, travel, and, remained, in, south, africa, where, she, died, on, 20, july, 1901, without, seeing, her, husband, again, president, kruger, first, went, to, marseille, and, then, on, to, the, netherlands, where, he, stayed, for, a, while, before, moving, finally, to, clarens, switzerland, where, he, died, in, exile, on, 14, july, 1904, the, first, sizeable, batch, of, boer, prisoners, of, war, taken, by, the, british, consisted, of, those, captured, at, the, battle, of, elandslaagte, on, 21, october, 1899, initially, these, pows, were, held, on, troopships, in, simons, bay, until, pow, camps, in, cape, town, and, simonstown, were, completed, in, total, six, prisoner, of, war, camps, would, be, set, up, in, south, africa, during, the, war, as, numbers, grew, the, british, decided, they, did, not, want, them, kept, locally, the, capture, of, 4000, pows, in, february, 1900, was, a, key, event, which, made, the, british, realise, they, could, not, accommodate, all, pows, in, south, africa, the, british, feared, they, could, be, freed, by, sympathetic, locals, moreover, they, already, had, trouble, supplying, their, own, troops, in, south, africa, and, did, not, want, the, added, burden, of, sending, supplies, for, the, pows, britain, therefore, chose, to, send, many, pows, overseas, around, 31, prisoner, of, war, camps, were, consequently, set, up, in, british, colonies, overseas, during, the, war, the, first, overseas, off, african, mainland, camps, were, opened, in, saint, helena, which, ultimately, received, about, 5, 000, pows, about, 5, 000, pows, were, sent, to, ceylon, other, pows, were, sent, to, bermuda, and, india, in, all, nearly, 26, 000, pows, were, sent, overseas, on, 15, march, 1900, lord, roberts, proclaimed, an, amnesty, for, all, burghers, except, leaders, who, took, an, oath, of, neutrality, and, returned, quietly, to, their, homes, it, is, estimated, that, between, 12, 000, and, 14, 000, burghers, took, this, oath, between, march, and, june, 1900, by, september, 1900, the, british, were, nominally, in, control, of, both, republics, with, the, exception, of, the, northern, part, of, the, transvaal, however, they, soon, discovered, that, they, only, controlled, the, territory, their, columns, physically, occupied, despite, the, loss, of, their, two, capital, cities, and, half, of, their, army, the, boer, commanders, adopted, guerrilla, warfare, tactics, primarily, conducting, raids, against, railways, resource, and, supply, targets, all, aimed, at, disrupting, the, operational, capacity, of, the, british, army, they, avoided, pitched, battles, and, casualties, were, light, each, boer, commando, unit, was, sent, to, the, district, from, which, its, members, had, been, recruited, which, meant, that, they, could, rely, on, local, support, and, personal, knowledge, of, the, terrain, and, the, towns, within, the, district, thereby, enabling, them, to, live, off, the, land, their, orders, were, simply, to, act, against, the, british, whenever, possible, their, tactics, were, to, strike, fast, and, hard, causing, as, much, damage, to, the, enemy, as, possible, and, then, to, withdraw, and, vanish, before, enemy, reinforcements, could, arrive, the, vast, distances, of, the, republics, allowed, the, boer, commandos, considerable, freedom, to, move, about, and, made, it, nearly, impossible, for, the, 250, 000, british, troops, to, control, the, territory, effectively, using, columns, alone, as, soon, as, a, british, column, left, a, town, or, district, british, control, of, that, area, faded, away, the, boer, commandos, were, especially, effective, during, the, initial, guerrilla, phase, of, the, war, because, roberts, had, assumed, that, the, war, would, end, with, the, capture, of, the, boer, capitals, and, the, dispersal, of, the, main, boer, armies, many, british, troops, were, therefore, redeployed, out, of, the, area, and, had, been, replaced, by, lower, quality, contingents, of, imperial, yeomanry, and, locally, raised, irregular, corps, from, late, may, 1900, the, first, successes, of, the, boer, guerrilla, strategy, were, at, lindley, where, 500, yeomanry, surrendered, and, at, heilbron, where, a, large, convoy, and, its, escort, were, captured, and, other, skirmishes, resulting, in, 1, 500, british, casualties, in, less, than, ten, days, in, december, 1900, de, la, rey, and, christiaan, beyers, attacked, and, mauled, a, british, brigade, at, nooitgedacht, inflicting, over, 650, casualties, as, a, result, of, these, and, other, boer, successes, the, british, led, by, lord, kitchener, mounted, three, extensive, searches, for, christiaan, de, wet, but, without, success, however, the, boer, raids, on, british, army, camps, and, other, targets, were, sporadic, and, poorly, planned, and, the, very, nature, of, the, boer, guerrilla, war, itself, had, practically, no, overall, long, term, objectives, with, the, exception, to, simply, harass, the, british, this, led, to, a, disorganised, pattern, of, scattered, engagements, between, the, british, and, the, boers, throughout, the, region, the, british, were, forced, to, quickly, revise, their, tactics, they, concentrated, on, restricting, the, freedom, of, movement, of, the, boer, commandos, and, depriving, them, of, local, support, the, railway, lines, had, provided, vital, lines, of, communication, and, supply, and, as, the, british, had, advanced, across, south, africa, they, had, used, armoured, trains, and, had, established, fortified, blockhouses, at, key, points, they, now, built, additional, blockhouses, each, housing, between, six, and, eight, soldiers, and, fortified, these, to, protect, supply, routes, against, boer, raiders, eventually, some, 8, 000, such, blockhouses, were, built, across, the, two, south, african, republics, radiating, from, the, larger, towns, along, principal, routes, each, blockhouse, cost, between, 800, and, 1, 000, and, took, about, three, months, to, build, despite, the, expense, they, proved, very, effective, not, one, bridge, at, which, a, blockhouse, was, sited, and, manned, was, blown, up, the, blockhouse, system, required, an, enormous, number, of, troops, to, garrison, well, over, 50, 000, british, troops, or, 50, battalions, were, involved, in, blockhouse, duty, greater, than, the, approximately, 30, 000, boers, in, the, field, during, the, guerrilla, phase, in, addition, up, to, 16, 000, africans, were, used, both, as, armed, guards, and, to, patrol, the, line, at, night, the, army, linked, the, blockhouses, with, barbed, wire, fences, to, parcel, up, the, wide, veld, into, smaller, areas, new, model, drives, were, mounted, under, which, a, continuous, line, of, troops, could, sweep, an, area, of, veld, bounded, by, blockhouse, lines, unlike, the, earlier, inefficient, scouring, of, the, countryside, by, scattered, columns, the, british, also, implemented, a, scorched, earth, policy, under, which, they, targeted, everything, within, the, controlled, areas, that, could, give, sustenance, to, the, boer, guerrillas, with, a, view, to, making, it, harder, for, the, boers, to, survive, as, british, troops, swept, the, countryside, they, systematically, destroyed, crops, burned, homesteads, and, farms, and, interned, boer, and, african, men, women, children, and, workers, in, concentration, camps, finally, the, british, also, established, their, own, mounted, raiding, columns, in, support, of, the, sweeper, columns, these, were, used, to, rapidly, follow, and, relentlessly, harass, the, boers, with, a, view, to, delaying, them, and, cutting, off, escape, while, the, sweeper, units, caught, up, many, of, the, 90, or, so, mobile, columns, formed, by, the, british, to, participate, in, such, drives, were, a, mixture, of, british, and, colonial, troops, but, they, also, had, a, large, minority, of, armed, africans, the, total, number, of, armed, africans, serving, with, these, columns, has, been, estimated, at, 20, 000, the, british, army, also, made, use, of, boer, auxiliaries, who, had, been, persuaded, to, change, sides, and, enlist, as, national, scouts, serving, under, the, command, of, general, andries, cronj, 1849, 1923, the, national, scouts, were, despised, as, joiners, but, came, to, number, a, fifth, of, the, fighting, afrikaners, by, the, end, of, the, war, the, british, utilised, armoured, trains, throughout, the, war, to, deliver, rapid, reaction, forces, much, more, quickly, to, incidents, such, as, boer, attacks, on, blockhouses, and, columns, or, to, drop, them, off, ahead, of, retreating, boer, columns, among, those, burghers, who, had, stopped, fighting, it, was, decided, to, form, peace, committees, to, persuade, those, who, were, still, fighting, to, desist, in, december, 1900, lord, kitchener, gave, permission, that, a, central, burgher, peace, committee, be, inaugurated, in, pretoria, by, the, end, of, 1900, some, thirty, envoys, were, sent, out, to, the, various, districts, to, form, local, peace, committees, to, persuade, burghers, to, give, up, the, fight, previous, leaders, of, the, boers, like, generals, piet, de, wet, and, andries, cronj, were, involved, in, the, organisation, meyer, de, kock, was, the, only, emissary, of, a, peace, committee, to, be, convicted, of, high, treason, and, executed, by, firing, squad, some, burghers, joined, the, british, in, their, fight, against, the, boers, by, the, end, of, hostilities, in, may, 1902, there, were, no, fewer, than, 5, 464, burghers, working, for, the, british, after, having, conferred, with, the, transvaal, leaders, de, wet, returned, to, the, orange, free, state, where, he, inspired, a, series, of, successful, attacks, and, raids, in, the, western, part, of, the, country, though, he, suffered, a, rare, defeat, at, bothaville, in, november, 1900, many, boers, who, had, earlier, returned, to, their, farms, and, towns, sometimes, after, being, given, formal, parole, by, the, british, took, up, arms, again, in, late, january, 1901, de, wet, led, a, renewed, invasion, of, cape, colony, this, was, less, successful, because, there, was, no, general, uprising, among, the, cape, boers, and, de, wet, s, men, were, hampered, by, bad, weather, and, relentlessly, pursued, by, british, forces, they, narrowly, escaped, across, the, orange, river, from, then, until, the, final, days, of, the, war, de, wet, remained, comparatively, quiet, rarely, attacking, british, army, camps, and, columns, partly, because, the, orange, free, state, was, effectively, left, desolate, by, british, sweeps, in, late, 1901, de, wet, overran, an, isolated, british, detachment, at, groenkop, inflicting, heavy, casualties, this, prompted, kitchener, to, launch, the, first, of, the, new, model, drives, against, him, de, wet, escaped, the, first, such, drive, but, lost, 300, of, his, fighters, this, was, a, severe, loss, and, a, portent, of, further, attrition, although, the, subsequent, attempts, to, round, up, de, wet, were, badly, handled, and, de, wet, s, forces, avoided, capture, the, boer, commandos, in, the, western, transvaal, were, very, active, after, september, 1901, several, battles, of, importance, were, fought, there, between, september, 1901, and, march, 1902, at, moedwil, on, 30, september, 1901, and, again, at, driefontein, on, 24, october, general, koos, de, la, rey, s, forces, attacked, british, camps, and, outposts, but, were, forced, to, withdraw, after, the, british, offered, strong, resistance, from, late, 1901, to, early, 1902, a, time, of, relative, quiet, descended, on, the, western, transvaal, february, 1902, saw, the, next, major, battle, in, that, region, on, 25, february, de, la, rey, attacked, a, british, column, under, lieutenant, colonel, s, b, von, donop, at, ysterspruit, near, wolmaransstad, de, la, rey, succeeded, in, capturing, many, men, and, a, large, amount, of, ammunition, the, boer, attacks, prompted, lord, methuen, the, british, second, in, command, after, kitchener, to, move, his, column, from, vryburg, to, klerksdorp, to, deal, with, de, la, rey, on, the, morning, of, 7, march, 1902, the, boers, attacked, the, rear, guard, of, methuen, s, moving, column, at, tweebosch, confusion, reigned, in, british, ranks, and, methuen, was, wounded, and, captured, by, the, boers, the, boer, victories, in, the, west, led, to, stronger, action, by, the, british, in, the, second, half, of, march, 1902, large, british, reinforcements, were, sent, to, the, western, transvaal, under, the, direction, of, ian, hamilton, the, opportunity, the, british, were, waiting, for, arose, on, 11, april, 1902, at, rooiwal, where, a, commando, led, by, general, jan, kemp, and, commandant, potgieter, attacked, a, superior, force, under, kekewich, the, british, soldiers, were, well, positioned, on, the, hillside, and, inflicted, severe, casualties, on, the, boers, charging, on, horseback, over, a, large, distance, beating, them, back, this, was, the, end, of, the, war, in, the, western, transvaal, and, also, the, last, major, battle, of, the, war, two, boer, forces, fought, in, this, area, one, under, botha, in, the, south, east, and, a, second, under, ben, viljoen, in, the, north, east, around, lydenburg, botha, s, forces, were, particularly, active, raiding, railways, and, british, supply, convoys, and, even, mounting, a, renewed, invasion, of, natal, in, september, 1901, after, defeating, british, mounted, infantry, in, the, battle, of, blood, river, poort, near, dundee, botha, was, forced, to, withdraw, by, heavy, rains, that, made, movement, difficult, and, crippled, his, horses, back, on, the, transvaal, territory, around, his, home, district, of, vryheid, botha, attacked, a, british, raiding, column, at, bakenlaagte, using, an, effective, mounted, charge, one, of, the, most, active, british, units, was, effectively, destroyed, in, this, engagement, this, made, botha, s, forces, the, target, of, increasingly, large, scorched, earth, drives, by, british, forces, in, which, the, british, made, particular, use, of, native, scouts, and, informers, eventually, botha, had, to, abandon, the, high, veld, and, retreat, to, a, narrow, enclave, bordering, swaziland, to, the, north, ben, viljoen, grew, steadily, less, active, his, forces, mounted, comparatively, few, attacks, and, as, a, result, the, boer, enclave, around, lydenburg, was, largely, unmolested, viljoen, was, eventually, captured, in, parts, of, cape, colony, particularly, the, cape, midlands, district, where, boers, formed, a, majority, of, the, white, inhabitants, the, british, had, always, feared, a, general, uprising, against, them, in, fact, no, such, uprising, ever, took, place, even, in, the, early, days, of, the, war, when, boer, armies, had, advanced, across, the, orange, the, cautious, conduct, of, some, of, the, elderly, orange, free, state, generals, had, been, one, factor, that, discouraged, the, cape, boers, from, siding, with, the, boer, republics, nevertheless, there, was, widespread, pro, boer, sympathy, some, of, the, cape, dutch, volunteered, to, help, the, british, but, a, much, larger, number, volunteered, to, help, the, other, side, the, political, factor, was, more, important, than, the, military, the, cape, dutch, according, to, milner, 90, percent, of, whom, favoured, the, rebels, controlled, the, provincial, legislature, and, it, s, authorities, forbade, the, british, army, to, burn, farms, or, to, force, boer, civilians, into, concentration, camps, the, british, had, more, limited, options, to, suppress, the, insurgency, in, the, cape, colony, as, result, after, he, escaped, across, the, orange, in, march, 1901, de, wet, had, left, forces, under, cape, rebels, kritzinger, and, gideon, scheepers, to, maintain, a, guerrilla, campaign, in, the, cape, midlands, the, campaign, here, was, one, of, the, least, chivalrous, of, the, war, with, intimidation, by, both, sides, of, each, other, s, civilian, sympathisers, in, one, of, many, skirmishes, commandant, johannes, l, tter, s, small, commando, was, tracked, down, by, a, much, superior, british, column, and, wiped, out, at, groenkloof, several, captured, boers, including, lotter, and, scheepers, who, was, captured, when, he, fell, ill, with, appendicitis, were, executed, by, the, british, for, treason, or, for, capital, crimes, such, as, the, murder, of, british, prisoners, or, of, unarmed, civilians, some, of, the, executions, took, place, in, public, to, deter, further, disaffection, fresh, boer, forces, under, jan, christiaan, smuts, joined, by, the, surviving, rebels, under, kritzinger, made, another, attack, on, the, cape, in, september, 1901, they, suffered, severe, hardships, and, were, hard, pressed, by, british, columns, but, eventually, rescued, themselves, by, routing, some, of, their, pursuers, at, the, battle, of, elands, river, and, capturing, their, equipment, from, then, until, the, end, of, the, war, smuts, increased, his, forces, from, among, cape, rebels, until, they, numbered, 3, 000, however, no, general, uprising, took, place, and, the, situation, in, the, cape, remained, stalemated, in, january, 1902, boer, leader, manie, maritz, was, implicated, in, the, leliefontein, massacre, in, the, far, northern, cape, while, no, other, government, actively, supported, the, boer, cause, individuals, from, several, countries, volunteered, and, formed, foreign, volunteer, units, these, primarily, came, from, europe, particularly, the, netherlands, germany, and, sweden, norway, other, countries, such, as, france, italy, ireland, then, part, of, the, united, kingdom, and, restive, areas, of, the, russian, empire, including, poland, and, georgia, also, formed, smaller, volunteer, corps, finns, fought, in, the, scandinavian, corps, two, volunteers, george, henri, anne, marie, victor, de, villebois, mareuil, of, france, and, yevgeny, maximov, of, russia, became, veggeneraals, fighting, generals, of, the, south, african, republic, towards, the, end, of, the, war, in, the, early, months, of, 1902, british, tactics, of, containment, denial, and, harassment, finally, began, to, yield, results, against, the, boer, guerrillas, the, sourcing, and, co, ordination, of, intelligence, became, increasingly, efficient, with, regular, reporting, from, observers, in, the, blockhouses, from, units, patrolling, the, fences, and, conducting, sweeper, operations, and, from, native, africans, in, rural, areas, who, increasingly, supplied, intelligence, as, the, scorched, earth, policy, took, effect, and, they, found, themselves, competing, with, the, boers, for, food, supplies, kitchener, s, forces, at, last, began, to, seriously, affect, the, boers, fighting, strength, and, freedom, of, manoeuvre, and, made, it, harder, for, the, boers, and, their, families, to, survive, despite, this, success, almost, half, the, boer, fighting, strength, around, 15, 000, men, were, still, in, the, field, fighting, by, may, 1902, however, kitchener, s, tactics, were, very, costly, britain, was, running, out, of, time, patience, and, money, needed, for, the, war, the, british, offered, terms, of, peace, on, various, occasions, notably, in, march, 1901, but, were, rejected, by, botha, and, the, bitter, enders, among, the, boers, they, pledged, to, fight, until, the, bitter, end, and, rejected, the, demand, for, compromise, made, by, the, hands, uppers, their, reasons, included, hatred, of, the, british, loyalty, to, their, dead, comrades, solidarity, with, fellow, commandos, an, intense, desire, for, independence, religious, arguments, and, fear, of, captivity, or, punishment, on, the, other, hand, their, women, and, children, were, dying, nearly, every, day, in, prison, camps, and, independence, seemed, more, and, more, impossible, the, last, of, the, boers, finally, surrendered, in, may, 1902, and, the, war, ended, with, the, treaty, of, vereeniging, signed, on, 31, may, 1902, after, a, period, of, obstinacy, the, british, reneged, and, offered, the, boers, generous, terms, of, conditional, surrender, in, order, to, bring, the, war, to, a, victorious, conclusion, the, boers, were, given, 3, 000, 000, for, reconstruction, and, were, promised, eventual, limited, self, government, which, was, granted, in, 1906, and, 1907, the, treaty, ended, the, existence, of, the, transvaal, and, orange, free, state, as, independent, boer, republics, and, placed, them, within, the, british, empire, the, union, of, south, africa, was, established, as, a, dominion, of, the, british, empire, in, 1910, the, policy, on, both, sides, was, to, minimise, the, role, of, nonwhites, but, the, need, for, manpower, continuously, stretched, those, resolves, at, the, battle, of, spion, kop, in, ladysmith, mohandas, k, gandhi, with, 300, free, burgher, indians, and, 800, indentured, indian, labourers, started, the, ambulance, corps, serving, the, british, side, as, the, war, raged, across, african, farms, and, their, homes, were, destroyed, many, became, refugees, and, they, like, the, boers, moved, to, the, towns, where, the, british, hastily, created, internment, camps, subsequently, the, british, scorched, earth, policies, were, applied, to, both, boers, and, africans, although, most, black, africans, were, not, considered, by, the, british, to, be, hostile, many, tens, of, thousands, were, also, forcibly, removed, from, boer, areas, and, also, placed, in, concentration, camps, africans, were, held, separately, from, boer, internees, eventually, there, were, a, total, of, 64, tented, camps, for, africans, conditions, were, as, bad, as, in, the, camps, for, the, boers, but, even, though, after, the, fawcett, commission, report, conditions, improved, in, the, boer, camps, improvements, were, much, slower, in, coming, to, the, black, camps, 20, 000, died, there, the, boers, and, the, british, both, feared, the, consequences, of, arming, africans, the, memories, of, the, zulu, and, other, tribal, conflicts, were, still, fresh, and, they, recognised, that, whoever, won, would, have, to, deal, with, the, consequences, of, a, mass, militarisation, of, the, tribes, there, was, therefore, an, unwritten, agreement, that, this, war, would, be, a, white, man, s, war, at, the, outset, british, officials, instructed, all, white, magistrates, in, the, natal, colony, to, appeal, to, zulu, amakhosi, chiefs, to, remain, neutral, and, president, kruger, sent, emissaries, asking, them, to, stay, out, of, it, however, in, some, cases, there, were, old, scores, to, be, settled, and, some, africans, such, as, the, swazis, were, eager, to, enter, the, war, with, the, specific, aim, of, reclaiming, land, won, by, the, boers, as, the, war, went, on, there, was, greater, involvement, of, africans, and, in, particular, large, numbers, became, embroiled, in, the, conflict, on, the, british, side, either, voluntarily, or, involuntarily, by, the, end, of, the, war, many, africans, had, been, armed, and, had, shown, conspicuous, gallantry, in, roles, such, as, scouts, messengers, watchmen, in, blockhouses, and, auxiliaries, and, there, were, more, flash, points, outside, of, the, war, on, 6, may, 1902, at, holkrantz, in, the, southeastern, transvaal, a, zulu, faction, had, their, cattle, stolen, and, their, women, and, children, tortured, by, the, boers, as, a, punishment, for, assisting, the, british, the, local, boer, officer, then, sent, an, insulting, message, to, the, tribe, challenging, them, to, take, back, their, cattle, the, zulus, attacked, at, night, and, in, a, mutual, bloodbath, the, boers, lost, 56, killed, and, 3, wounded, while, the, africans, suffered, 52, killed, and, 48, wounded, 601, about, 10, 000, black, men, were, attached, to, boer, units, where, they, performed, camp, duties, a, handful, unofficially, fought, in, combat, the, british, army, employed, over, 14, 000, africans, as, wagon, drivers, even, more, had, combatant, roles, as, spies, guides, and, eventually, as, soldiers, by, 1902, there, were, about, 30, 000, armed, africans, in, the, british, army, the, term, concentration, camp, was, used, to, describe, camps, operated, by, the, british, in, south, africa, during, this, conflict, in, the, years, 1900, 1902, and, the, term, grew, in, prominence, during, this, period, the, camps, had, originally, been, set, up, by, the, british, army, as, refugee, camps, to, provide, refuge, for, civilian, families, who, had, been, forced, to, abandon, their, homes, for, whatever, reason, related, to, the, war, however, when, kitchener, took, over, in, late, 1900, he, introduced, new, tactics, in, an, attempt, to, break, the, guerrilla, campaign, and, the, influx, of, civilians, grew, dramatically, as, a, result, disease, and, starvation, killed, thousands, kitchener, initiated, plans, to, as, boer, farms, were, destroyed, by, the, british, under, their, scorched, earth, policy, including, the, systematic, destruction, of, crops, and, slaughtering, of, livestock, the, burning, down, of, homesteads, and, farms, to, prevent, the, boers, from, resupplying, from, a, home, base, many, tens, of, thousands, of, women, and, children, were, forcibly, moved, into, the, concentration, camps, this, was, not, the, first, appearance, of, internment, camps, as, the, spanish, had, used, internment, in, cuba, in, the, ten, years, war, and, the, americans, in, the, philippine, american, war, but, the, boer, war, concentration, camp, system, was, the, first, time, that, a, whole, nation, had, been, systematically, targeted, and, the, first, in, which, whole, regions, had, been, depopulated, eventually, there, were, a, total, of, 45, tented, camps, built, for, boer, internees, and, 64, for, black, africans, of, the, 28, 000, boer, men, captured, as, prisoners, of, war, 25, 630, were, sent, overseas, to, prisoner, of, war, camps, throughout, the, british, empire, the, vast, majority, of, boers, remaining, in, the, local, camps, were, women, and, children, around, 26, 370, boer, women, and, children, were, to, perish, in, these, concentration, camps, of, the, more, than, 120, 000, blacks, and, coloureds, imprisoned, too, around, 20, 000, died, the, camps, were, poorly, administered, from, the, outset, and, became, increasingly, overcrowded, when, kitchener, s, troops, implemented, the, internment, strategy, on, a, vast, scale, conditions, were, terrible, for, the, health, of, the, internees, mainly, due, to, neglect, poor, hygiene, and, bad, sanitation, the, supply, of, all, items, was, unreliable, partly, because, of, the, constant, disruption, of, communication, lines, by, the, boers, the, food, rations, were, meagre, and, there, was, a, two, tier, allocation, policy, whereby, families, of, men, who, were, still, fighting, were, routinely, given, smaller, rations, than, others, 505, the, inadequate, shelter, poor, diet, bad, hygiene, and, overcrowding, led, to, malnutrition, and, endemic, contagious, diseases, such, as, measles, typhoid, and, dysentery, to, which, the, children, were, particularly, vulnerable, coupled, with, a, shortage, of, modern, medical, facilities, many, of, the, internees, died, while, much, of, the, british, press, including, the, times, played, down, the, problems, in, the, camps, emily, hobhouse, helped, raise, public, awareness, in, britain, of, the, atrocious, conditions, as, well, as, being, instrumental, in, bringing, relief, to, the, concentration, camps, it, is, estimated, that, the, total, cost, of, the, war, to, the, british, government, was, 211, 156, 000, equivalent, to, 19, 9bn, in, 2022, the, boer, war, also, saw, the, first, war, crimes, prosecutions, in, british, military, history, they, centered, around, the, bushveldt, carbineers, bvc, a, british, army, irregular, regiment, of, mounted, rifles, active, in, the, northern, transvaal, originally, raised, in, february, 1901, the, bvc, was, composed, mainly, of, british, and, commonwealth, servicemen, with, a, generous, admixture, of, defectors, from, the, boer, commandos, on, 4, october, 1901, a, letter, signed, by, 15, members, of, the, bushveldt, carbineers, bvc, garrison, at, fort, edward, was, secretly, dispatched, to, col, f, h, hall, the, british, army, officer, commanding, at, pietersburg, written, by, bvc, trooper, robert, mitchell, cochrane, a, former, justice, of, the, peace, from,

morrison, to, sgt, d, c, oldham, the, actual, killing, was, alleged, to, have, been, carried, out, by, sgt, oldham, and, bvc, troopers, eden, arnold, brown, heath, and, dale, 2, the, shooting, of, bvc, trooper, b, j, van, buuren, by, bvc, lt, peter, handcock, on, 4, july, 1901, trooper, van, buuren, an, afrikaner, had, disapproved, of, the, killings, at, valdezia, and, had, informed, the, victims, wives, and, children, who, were, imprisoned, at, fort, edward, of, what, had, happened, 3, the, revenge, killing, of, floris, visser, a, wounded, prisoner, of, war, near, the, koedoes, river, on, 11, august, 1901, visser, had, been, captured, by, a, bvc, patrol, led, by, lieut, harry, morant, two, days, before, his, death, after, visser, had, been, exhaustively, interrogated, and, conveyed, for, 15, miles, by, the, patrol, lt, morant, had, ordered, his, men, to, form, a, firing, squad, and, shoot, him, the, squad, consisted, of, bvc, troopers, a, j, petrie, j, j, gill, wild, and, t, j, botha, a, coup, de, gr, ce, was, delivered, by, bvc, lt, harry, picton, the, slaying, of, floris, visser, was, in, retaliation, for, the, combat, death, of, morant, s, close, friend, bvc, captain, percy, frederik, hunt, at, duivelskloof, on, 6, august, 1901, 4, the, shooting, ordered, by, capt, taylor, and, lt, morant, of, four, surrendered, afrikaners, and, four, dutch,

cochrane, alleged, that, the, killer, of, rev, heese, was, bvc, lt, peter, handcock, although, cochrane, made, no, mention, of, the, fact, rev, heese, s, driver, a, member, of, the, southern, ndebele, people, was, also, killed, 5, the, orders, given, by, bvc, lt, charles, h, g, hannam, to, open, fire, on, a, wagon, train, containing, afrikaner, women, and, children, who, were, coming, in, to, surrender, at, fort, edward, on, 5, september, 1901, the, ensuing, gunfire, led, to, the, deaths, of, two, boys, aged, 5, and, 13, years, and, the, wounding, of, a, 9, year, old, girl, 6, the, shooting, of, roelf, van, staden, and, his, sons, roelf, and, christiaan, near, fort, edward, on, 7, september, 1901, all, were, coming, in, to, surrender, in, the, hope, of, gaining, medical, treatment, for, teenaged, christiaan, who, was, suffering, from, recurring, bouts, of, fever, instead, they, were, met, at, the, sweetwaters, farm, near, fort, edward, by, a, party, consisting, of, lts, morant, and, handcock, joined, by, bvc, sgt, maj, hammet, corp, macmahon, and, troopers, hodds, botha, and, thompson, roelf, van, staden, and, both, his, sons, were, then, shot, allegedly, after, being, forced, to, dig, their, own, graves, the, letter, then, accused, the, field, commander, of, the, bvc, major, robert, william, lenehan, of, being, privy, to, these, misdeamenours, it, is, for, this, reason, that, we, have, taken, the, liberty, of, addressing, this, communication, direct, to, you, after, listing, numerous, civilian, witnesses, who, could, confirm, their, allegations, trooper, cochrane, concluded, sir, many, of, us, are, australians, who, have, fought, throughout, nearly, the, whole, war, while, others, are, africaners, who, have, fought, from, colenso, till, now, we, cannot, return, home, with, the, stigma, of, these, crimes, attached, to, our, names, therefore, we, humbly, pray, that, a, full, and, exhaustive, inquiry, be, made, by, imperial, officers, in, order, that, the, truth, be, elicited, and, justice, done, also, we, beg, that, all, witnesses, may, be, kept, in, camp, at, pietersburg, till, the, inquiry, is, finished, so, deeply, do, we, deplore, the, opprobrium, which, must, be, inseparably, attached, to, these, crimes, that, scarcely, a, man, once, his, time, is, up, can, be, prevailed, to, re, enlist, in, this, corps, trusting, for, the, credit, of, thinking, you, will, grant, the, inquiry, we, seek, in, response, to, the, letter, written, by, trooper, cochrane, col, hall, summoned, all, fort, edward, officers, and, non, commissioned,

trial, transcripts, like, almost, all, others, dating, from, between, 1850, and, 1914, were, later, destroyed, by, the, civil, service, it, is, known, that, a, court, of, inquiry, the, british, military, s, equivalent, to, a, grand, jury, was, convened, on, 16, october, 1901, the, president, of, the, court, was, col, h, m, carter, who, was, assisted, by, captain, e, evans, and, major,

well, as, sgt, maj, morrison, were, charged, with, committing, the, offense, of, murder, while, on, active, service, 2, in, relation, to, what, was, dubbed, the, van, buuren, incident, maj, lenahan,

offense, of, murder, following, the, indictments, maj, r, whigham, and, col, james, st, clair, ordered, bolton, to, appear, for, the, prosecution, as, he, was, considered, less, expensive, than, hiring, a, barrister, bolton, vainly, requested, to, be, excused, writing, my, knowledge, of, law, is, insufficient, for, so, intricate, a, matter, the, first, court, martial, opened, on, 16, january, 1901, with, lieut, col, h, c, denny, presiding, over, a, panel, of, six, judges, maj, j, f, thomas, a, solicitor, from, tenterfield, new, south, wales, had, been, retained, to, defend, maj, lenahan,

trooper, theunis, j, botha, testified, that, visser, who, had, been, promised, that, his, life, would, be, spared, was, cooperative, during, two, days, of, interrogation, and, that, all, his, information, was, later, found, to, have, been, true, despite, this, lt, morant, ordered, him, shot, in, response, lt, morant, testified, that, he, only, followed, orders, to, take, no, prisoners, as, relayed, to, the, late, captain, hunt, by, col, hubert, hamilton, he, also, alleged, that, floris, visser, had, been, captured, wearing, a, british, army, jacket, and, that, captain, hunt, s, body, had, been, mutilated, in, response, the, court, moved, to, pretoria, where, col, hamilton, testified, that, he, had, never, spoken, to, captain, hunt, with, reference, to, his, duties, in, the, northern, transvaal, though, stunned, maj, thomas, argued, that, his, clients, were, not, guilty, because, they, believed, that, they, acted, under, orders, in, response, maj, bolton, argued, that, they, were, illegal, orders, and, said, the, right, of, killing, an, armed, man, exists, only, so, long, as, he, resists, as, soon, as, he, submits, he, is, entitled, to, be, treated, as, a, prisoner, of, war, the, court, ruled, in, maj, bolton, s, favor, lt, morant, was, found, guilty, of, murder, lts, handcock, witton, and, picton, were, convicted, of, the, lesser, charge, of, manslaughter, on,

being, convicted, of, murdering, eight, afrikaner, pows, this, court, martial, for, war, crimes, was, one, of, the, first, such, prosecutions, in, british, military, history, although, morant, left, a, written, confession, in, his, cell, he, went, on, to, become, a, folk, hero, in, modern, australia, believed, by, many, australians, to, be, the, victim, of, a, kangaroo, court, public, appeals, have, been, made, for, morant, to, be, retried, or, pardoned, his, court, martial, and, death, have, been, the, subject, of, books, a, stage, play, and, an, award, winning, australian, new, wave,

months, of, a, life, sentence, picton, was, cashiered, the, second, boer, war, cast, long, shadows, over, the, history, of, the, south, african, region, the, predominantly, agrarian, society, of, the, former, boer, republics, was, profoundly, and, fundamentally, affected, by, the, scorched, earth, policy, of, roberts, and, kitchener, the, devastation, of, both, boer, and, black, african, populations, in, the, concentration, camps, and, through, war, and, exile, were, to, have, a, lasting, effect, on, the, demography, and, quality, of, life, in, the, region, many, exiles, and, prisoners, were, unable, to, return, to, their, farms, at, all, others, attempted, to, do, so, but, were, forced, to, abandon, the, farms, as, unworkable, given, the, damage, caused, by, farm, burning, in, the, course, of, the, scorched, earth, policy, destitute, boers, and, black, africans, swelled, the, ranks, of, the, unskilled, urban, poor, competing, with, the, uitlanders, in, the, mines, the, postwar, reconstruction, administration, was, presided, over, by, lord, milner, and, his, largely, oxford, educated, milner, s, kindergarten, this, small, group, of, civil, servants, had, a, profound, effect, on, the, region, eventually, leading, to, the, union, of, south, africa, in, the, aftermath, of, the, war, an, imperial, administration, freed, from, accountability, to, a, domestic, electorate, set, about, reconstructing, an, economy, that, was, by, then, predicated, unambiguously, on, gold, at, the, same, time, british, civil, servants, municipal, officials, and, their, cultural, adjuncts, were, hard, at, work, in, the, heartland, of, the, former, boer, republics, helping, to, forge, new, identities, first, as, british, south, africans, and, then, later, still, as, white, south, africans, some, scholars, for, good, reasons, identify, these, new, identities, as, partly, underpinning, the, act, of, union, that, followed, in, 1910, although, challenged, by, a, boer, rebellion, only, four, years, later, they, did, much, to, shape, south, african, politics, between, the, two, world, wars, and, right, up, to, the, present, day, the, counterinsurgency, techniques, and, lessons, the, restriction, of, movement, the, containment, of, space, the, ruthless, targeting, of, anything, everything, and, anyone, that, could, give, sustenance, to, guerrillas, the, relentless, harassment, through, sweeper, groups, coupled, with, rapid, reaction, forces, the, sourcing, and, co, ordination, of, intelligence, and, the, nurturing, of, native, allies, learned, during, the, boer, war, were, used, by, the, british, and, other, forces, in, future, guerrilla, campaigns, including, to, counter, malayan, communist, rebels, during, the, malayan, emergency, in, world, war, ii, the, british, also, adopted, some, of, the, concepts, of, raiding, from, the, boer, commandos, when, after, the, fall, of, france, they, set, up, their, special, raiding, forces, and, in, acknowledgement, of, their, erstwhile, enemies, chose, the, name, british, commandos, many, of, the, boers, referred, to, the, war, as, the, second, of, the, freedom, wars, the, most, resistant, of, boers, wanted, to, continue, the, fight, and, were, known, as, bittereinders, or, irreconcilables, and, at, the, end, of, the, war, a, number, of, boer, fighters, such, as, deneys, reitz, chose, exile, rather, than, sign, an, oath, such, as, the, following, to, pledge, allegiance, to, britain, the, bearer, prisoner, name, has, been, released, from, prison, of, war, camp, camp, name, on, signing, that, he, acknowledge, terms, of, surrender, and, becomes, a, british, subject, over, the, following, decade, many, returned, to, south, africa, and, never, signed, the, pledge, some, like, reitz, eventually, reconciled, themselves, to, the, new, status, quo, but, others, did, not, one, of, the, most, important, events, in, the, decade, after, the, end, of, the, war, was, the, creation, of, the, union, of, south, africa, later, the, republic, of, south, africa, it, proved, a, key, ally, to, britain, as, a, dominion, of, the, british, empire, during, the, world, wars, at, the, start, of, the, first, world, war, a, crisis, ensued, when, the, south, african, government, led, by, louis, botha, and, other, former, boer, fighters, such, as, jan, smuts, declared, support, for, britain, and, agreed, to, send, troops, to, take, over, the, german, colony, of, german, south, west, africa, namibia, many, boers, were, opposed, to, fighting, for, britain, especially, against, germany, which, had, been, sympathetic, to, their, struggle, a, number, of, bittereinders, and, their, allies, took, part, in, a, revolt, known, as, the, maritz, rebellion, this, was, quickly, suppressed, and, in, 1916, the, leading, boer, rebels, in, the, maritz, rebellion, escaped, lightly, especially, compared, with, the, fate, of, leading, irish, rebels, of, the, easter, rising, with, terms, of, imprisonment, of, six, and, seven, years, and, heavy, fines, two, years, later, they, were, released, from, prison, as, louis, botha, recognised, the, value, of, reconciliation, many, irish, nationalists, sympathised, with, the, boers, viewing, them, to, be, a, people, oppressed, by, british, imperialism, much, like, they, viewed, themselves, irish, miners, already, in, the, transvaal, at, the, start, of, the, war, formed, the, nucleus, of, two, irish, commandos, the, second, irish, brigade, was, headed, up, by, an, australian, of, irish, parents, colonel, arthur, lynch, in, addition, small, groups, of, irish, volunteers, went, to, south, africa, to, fight, with, the, boers, this, despite, the, fact, that, there, were, many, irish, troops, fighting, in, the, british, army, including, the, royal, dublin, fusiliers, in, britain, the, pro, boer, campaign, expanded, with, writers, often, idealising, the, boer, society, the, war, also, highlighted, the, dangers, of, britain, s, policy, of, non, alignment, and, deepened, her, isolation, the, 1900, uk, general, election, also, known, as, the, khaki, election, was, called, by, the, prime, minister, lord, salisbury, on, the, back, of, recent, british, victories, there, was, much, enthusiasm, for, the, war, at, this, point, resulting, in, a, victory, for, the, conservative, government, however, public, support, quickly, waned, as, it, became, apparent, that, the, war, would, not, be, easy, and, it, dragged, on, partially, contributing, to, the, conservatives, spectacular, defeat, in, 1906, there, was, public, outrage, at, the, use, of, scorched, earth, tactics, and, at, the, conditions, in, the, concentration, camps, it, also, became, apparent, that, there, were, serious, problems, with, public, health, in, britain, since, up, to, 40, of, recruits, in, britain, were, unfit, for, military, service, and, suffered, from, medical, problems, such, as, rickets, and, other, poverty, related, illnesses, that, came, at, a, time, of, increasing, concern, for, the, state, of, the, poor, in, britain, having, taken, the, country, into, a, prolonged, war, the, conservative, government, was, rejected, by, the, electorate, at, the, first, general, election, after, the, war, was, over, balfour, succeeded, his, uncle, lord, salisbury, in, 1903, immediately, after, the, war, took, over, a, conservative, party, that, had, won, two, successive, landslide, majorities, but, led, it, to, a, landslide, defeat, in, 1906, the, 2nd, anglo, boer, war, was, a, victory, that, costed, british, taxpayers, more, than, 200m, 22, 000, empire, troops, and, more, than, 400, 000, army, horses, donkeys, and, mules, were, killed, britain, had, expected, a, swift, victory, against, a, mostly, unmilitarised, and, predominantly, agricultural, based, opponent, however, the, conflict, dragged, on, into, the, 20th, century, and, the, reign, of, a, new, monarch, at, the, time, britain, was, the, world, s, most, technologically, advanced, military, the, results, caused, many, both, domestically, and, internationally, to, question, the, dominance, of, the, british, empire, especially, as, nations, like, the, united, states, germany, and, japan, had, started, to, become, major, powers, the, number, of, horses, killed, in, the, war, was, at, the, time, unprecedented, in, modern, warfare, for, example, in, the, relief, of, kimberley, french, s, cavalry, rode, 500, horses, to, their, deaths, in, a, single, day, the, wastage, was, particularly, heavy, among, british, forces, for, several, reasons, overloading, of, horses, with, unnecessary, equipment, and, saddlery, failure, to, rest, and, acclimatise, horses, after, long, sea, voyages, and, later, in, the, war, poor, management, by, inexperienced, mounted, troops, and, distant, control, by, unsympathetic, staffs, the, average, life, expectancy, of, a, british, horse, from, the, time, of, its, arrival, in, port, elizabeth, was, around, six, weeks, 213, 214, most, of, the, horses, and, mules, brought, to, south, africa, during, the, war, came, from, the, united, states, in, total, 109, 878, horses, and, 81, 524, mules, were, shipped, from, new, orleans, to, south, africa, in, 166, voyages, from, october, 1899, to, june, 1902, the, cost, of, these, animals, and, their, transport, was, an, average, of, us, 597, 978, per, month, a, significant, number, of, horses, and, mules, died, during, the, transit, across, the, atlantic, for, example, during, the, ss, manchester, city, s, 36, day, passage, 187, of, her, 2, 090, mules, died, horses, were, slaughtered, for, their, meat, when, needed, during, the, sieges, of, kimberley, and, ladysmith, horses, were, consumed, as, food, once, the, regular, sources, of, meat, were, depleted, the, besieged, british, forces, in, ladysmith, also, produced, chevril, a, bovril, like, paste, by, boiling, down, the, horse, meat, to, a, jelly, paste, and, serving, it, like, beef, tea, the, horse, memorial, in, port, elizabeth, is, a, tribute, to, the, 300, 000, horses, that, died, during, the, conflict, the, vast, majority, of, troops, fighting, for, the, british, army, came, from, great, britain, yet, a, significant, number, came, from, other, parts, of, the, british, empire, these, countries, had, their, own, internal, disputes, over, whether, they, should, remain, tied, to, london, or, have, full, independence, which, carried, over, into, the, debate, around, the, sending, of, forces, to, assist, the, war, though, not, fully, independent, on, foreign, affairs, these, countries, did, have, local, say, over, how, much, support, to, provide, and, the, manner, it, was, provided, ultimately, australia, canada, new, zealand, and, british, south, african, company, administered, rhodesia, all, sent, volunteers, to, aid, the, united, kingdom, troops, were, also, raised, to, fight, with, the, british, from, the, cape, colony, and, natal, some, boer, fighters, such, as, smuts, and, botha, were, technically, british, subjects, as, they, came, from, the, cape, colony, and, colony, of, natal, respectively, there, were, also, many, volunteers, from, the, empire, who, were, not, selected, for, the, official, contingents, from, their, countries, and, travelled, privately, to, south, africa, to, form, private, units, such, as, the, canadian, scouts, and, doyle, s, australian, scouts, there, were, also, some, european, volunteer, units, from, british, india, and, british, ceylon, though, the, british, government, refused, offers, of, non, white, troops, from, the, empire, some, cape, coloureds, also, volunteered, early, in, the, war, but, later, some, of, them, were, effectively, conscripted, and, kept, in, segregated, units, as, a, community, they, received, comparatively, little, reward, for, their, services, in, many, ways, the, war, set, the, pattern, for, the, empire, s, later, involvement, in, the, two, world, wars, specially, raised, units, consisting, mainly, of, volunteers, were, dispatched, overseas, to, serve, with, forces, from, elsewhere, in, the, british, empire, the, united, states, stayed, neutral, in, the, conflict, but, some, american, citizens, were, eager, to, participate, early, in, the, war, lord, roberts, cabled, burnham, a, veteran, of, both, matabele, wars, but, at, that, very, moment, prospecting, in, the, klondike, to, serve, on, his, personal, staff, as, chief, of, scouts, burnham, went, on, to, receive, the, highest, awards, of, any, american, who, served, in, the, war, but, american, mercenaries, participated, on, both, sides, from, 1899, to, 1901, the, six, separate, self, governing, colonies, in, australia, sent, their, own, contingents, to, serve, in, the, boer, war, that, much, of, the, population, of, the, colonies, had, originated, from, great, britain, explains, a, general, desire, to, support, britain, during, the, conflict, after, the, colonies, formed, the, commonwealth, of, australia, in, 1901, the, new, government, of, australia, sent, commonwealth, contingents, to, the, war, the, boer, war, was, thus, the, first, war, in, which, the, commonwealth, of, australia, fought, a, few, australians, fought, on, the, boer, side, the, most, famous, and, colourful, character, was, colonel, arthur, alfred, lynch, formerly, of, ballarat, victoria, who, raised, the, second, irish, brigade, the, australian, climate, and, geography, were, far, closer, to, that, of, south, africa, than, most, other, parts, of, the, empire, so, australians, adapted, quickly, to, the, environment, with, troops, serving, mostly, among, the, army, s, mounted, rifles, enlistment, in, all, official, australian, contingents, totalled, 16, 463, another, five, to, seven, thousand, australians, served, in, irregular, regiments, raised, in, south, africa, perhaps, five, hundred, australian, irregulars, were, killed, in, total, 20, 000, or, more, australians, served, and, about, 1, 000, were, killed, a, total, of, 267, died, from, disease, 251, were, killed, in, action, or, died, from, wounds, sustained, in, battle, a, further, 43, men, were, reported, missing, when, the, war, began, some, australians, like, some, britons, opposed, it, as, the, war, dragged, on, some, australians, became, disenchanted, in, part, because, of, the, sufferings, of, boer, civilians, reported, in, the, press, in, an, interesting, twist, for, australians, when, the, british, missed, capturing, president, paul, kruger, as, he, escaped, pretoria, during, its, fall, in, june, 1900, a, melbourne, punch, 21, june, 1900, cartoon, depicted, how, the, war, could, be, won, using, the, kelly, gang, the, convictions, and, executions, of, two, australian, lieutenants, harry, harbord, morant, colloquially, known, as, the, breaker, for, his, skill, with, horses, and, peter, handcock, in, 1902, and, the, imprisonment, of, a, third, george, witton, had, minimal, impact, on, the, australian, public, at, the, time, despite, later, legend, the, controversial, court, martial, saw, the, three, convicted, of, executing, boer, prisoners, under, their, authority, after, the, war, though, australians, joined, an, empire, wide, campaign, that, saw, witton, released, from, jail, much, later, some, australians, came, to, see, the, execution, of, morant, and, handcock, as, instances, of, wrongfully, executed, australians, as, illustrated, in, the, 1980, australian, film, breaker, morant, it, is, believed, that, up, to, 50, aboriginal, australians, served, in, the, boer, war, as, trackers, according, to, dale, kerwin, an, indigenous, research, fellow, at, griffith, university, such, is, the, lack, of, information, that, is, available, about, the, trackers, it, is, even, uncertain, as, to, whether, they, returned, to, australia, at, the, end, of, the, war, he, has, claimed, that, at, the, end, of, the, war, in, 1902, when, the, australian, contingents, returned, the, trackers, may, not, have, been, allowed, back, to, australia, due, to, the, white, australia, policy, a, total, of, around, 8000, canadians, arrived, in, south, africa, to, fight, for, britain, these, arrived, in, two, contingents, the, first, on, 30, october, 1899, the, second, on, 21, january, 1900, a, third, contingent, of, cavalry, strathcona, s, horse, embarked, for, south, africa, on, 16, 17, march, 1900, they, remained, until, may, 1902, with, approximately, 7, 368, soldiers, in, a, combat, situation, the, conflict, became, the, largest, military, engagement, involving, canadian, soldiers, from, the, time, of, confederation, until, the, great, war, eventually, 270, of, these, soldiers, died, in, the, course, of, the, boer, war, as, one, of, the, country, s, first, major, wars, the, arrival, and, movement, of, troops, was, widely, documented, by, early, war, photographers, english, born, and, later, canadian, inglis, sheldon, williams, was, one, of, the, most, notable, documenting, the, movement, of, hundreds, of, troops, between, north, america, and, southern, africa, the, canadian, public, was, initially, divided, on, the, decision, to, go, to, war, as, some, citizens, did, not, want, canada, to, become, britain, s, tool, for, engaging, in, armed, conflicts, many, anglophone, citizens, were, pro, empire, and, wanted, the, prime, minister, sir, wilfrid, laurier, to, support, the, british, in, their, conflict, on, the, other, hand, many, francophone, citizens, felt, threatened, by, the, continuation, of, british, imperialism, to, their, national, sovereignty, in, the, end, to, appease, the, citizens, who, wanted, war, and, to, avoid, angering, those, who, oppose, it, laurier, sent, 1, 000, volunteers, under, the, command, of, lieutenant, colonel, william, otter, to, aid, the, confederation, in, its, war, to, liberate, the, peoples, of, the, boer, controlled, states, in, south, africa, the, volunteers, were, provided, to, the, british, if, the, latter, paid, costs, of, the, battalion, after, it, arrived, in, south, africa, the, supporters, of, the, war, claimed, that, it, pitted, british, freedom, justice, and, civilization, against, boer, backwardness, the, french, canadians, opposition, to, the, canadian, involvement, in, a, british, colonial, venture, eventually, led, to, a, three, day, riot, in, various, areas, of, quebec, commonwealth, involvement, in, the, boer, war, can, be, summarised, into, three, parts, the, first, part, october, 1899, december, 1899, was, characterised, by, questionable, decisions, and, blunders, from, the, commonwealth, leadership, which, affected, its, soldiers, greatly, the, soldiers, of, the, commonwealth, were, shocked, at, the, number, of, afrikaner, soldiers, who, were, willing, to, oppose, the, british, the, afrikaner, troops, were, very, willing, to, fight, for, their, country, and, were, armed, with, modern, weaponry, and, were, highly, mobile, soldiers, this, was, one, of, the, best, examples, of, guerrilla, style, warfare, which, would, be, employed, throughout, the, twentieth, century, after, set, piece, fighting, was, seen, as, a, hindrance, by, certain, groups, the, boer, soldiers, would, evade, capture, and, secure, provisions, from, their, enemies, therefore, they, were, able, to, exist, as, a, fighting, entity, for, an, indeterminate, period, of, time, the, end, of, the, first, part, was, the, period, in, mid, december, referred, to, as, the, black, week, during, the, week, of, 10, 17, december, 1899, the, british, suffered, three, major, defeats, at, the, hands, of, the, boers, at, the, battlefields, of, stormberg, magersfontein, and, colenso, afterwards, the, british, called, upon, more, volunteers, to, take, part, in, the, war, from, the, commonwealth, the, second, part, of, the, war, february, april, 1900, was, the, opposite, of, the, first, after, the, british, reorganised, and, reinforced, under, new, leadership, they, began, to, experience, success, against, the, boer, soldiers, commonwealth, soldiers, resorted, to, using, blockhouses, farm, burning, and, concentration, camps, to, persuade, the, resisting, boers, into, submission, the, final, phase, of, the, war, was, the, guerrilla, phase, in, which, many, boer, soldiers, turned, to, guerrilla, tactics, such, as, raiding, infrastructure, or, communications, lines, many, canadian, soldiers, did, not, actually, see, combat, after, they, had, been, shipped, over, to, south, africa, since, many, arrived, around, the, time, of, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, vereeniging, on, 31, may, 1902, since, the, boers, were, mounting, a, heavy, resistance, to, the, advancing, mounted, units, the, commonwealth, infantry, units, were, tasked, with, holding, the, boer, units, while, the, mounted, units, found, another, route, across, the, river, with, less, resistance, even, after, the, cavalry, made, it, across, to, the, other, side, of, the, river, further, down, the, line, the, infantry, had, to, advance, onto, the, town, of, doornkop, as, they, were, the, ones, who, were, tasked, with, its, capture, the, canadians, suffered, very, minimal, casualties, and, achieved, their, objective, after, the, boer, soldiers, retreated, from, their, positions, although, the, canadians, suffered, minimal, casualties, the, lead, british, unit, in, the, infantry, advance, the, gordon, highlanders, did, sustain, heavy, casualties, in, their, march, from, the, riflemen, of, the, boer, force, british, garrisons, in, india, contributed, 18, 534, british, officers, and, men, as, well, as, an, estimated, 10, 000, indian, auxiliaries, deployed, to, assist, them, india, also, sent, 7, 000, horses, ponies, and, mules, indian, auxiliaries, were, only, employed, in, non, combatant, roles, the, natal, indian, ambulance, corps, created, by, gandhi, and, financed, by, the, local, indian, community, served, at, the, battles, of, colenso, and, spion, kop, when, the, second, boer, war, seemed, imminent, new, zealand, offered, its, support, on, 28, september, 1899, prime, minister, richard, seddon, asked, parliament, to, approve, the, offer, to, the, imperial, government, of, a, contingent, of, mounted, rifles, thus, becoming, the, first, british, colony, to, send, troops, to, the, boer, war, the, british, position, in, the, dispute, with, the, transvaal, was, moderate, and, righteous, he, maintained, he, stressed, the, crimson, tie, of, empire, that, bound, new, zealand, to, the, mother, country, and, the, importance, of, a, strong, british, empire, for, the, colony, s, security, by, the, time, peace, was, concluded, two, and, a, half, years, later, 10, contingents, of, volunteers, totalling, nearly, 6, 500, men, from, new, zealand, with, 8, 000, horses, had, fought, in, the, conflict, along, with, doctors, nurses, veterinary, surgeons, and, a, small, number, of, school, teachers, some, 70, new, zealanders, died, from, enemy, action, with, another, 158, killed, accidentally, or, by, disease, the, first, new, zealander, to, be, killed, was, farrier, g, r, bradford, at, jasfontein, farm, on, 18, december, 1899, the, boer, war, was, greeted, with, extraordinary, enthusiasm, when, the, war, was, over, and, peace, was, greeted, with, patriotism, and, national, pride, this, is, best, shown, by, the, fact, that, the, third, fourth, and, fifth, contingents, from, new, zealand, were, funded, by, public, conscription, rhodesian, military, units, such, as, the, british, south, africa, police, rhodesia, regiment, and, southern, rhodesian, volunteers, served, in, the, second, boer, war, during, the, war, the, british, army, also, included, substantial, contingents, from, south, africa, itself, there, were, large, communities, of, english, speaking, immigrants, and, settlers, in, natal, and, cape, colony, especially, around, cape, town, and, grahamstown, which, formed, volunteer, units, that, took, the, field, or, local, town, guards, at, one, stage, of, the, war, a, colonial, division, consisting, of, five, light, horse, and, infantry, units, under, brigadier, general, edward, brabant, took, part, in, the, invasion, of, the, orange, free, state, part, of, it, withstood, a, siege, by, christiaan, de, wet, at, wepener, on, the, borders, of, basutoland, another, large, source, of, volunteers, was, the, uitlander, community, many, of, whom, hastily, left, johannesburg, in, the, days, immediately, preceding, the, war, later, during, the, war, kitchener, attempted, to, form, a, boer, police, force, as, part, of, his, efforts, to, pacify, the, occupied, areas, and, effect, a, reconciliation, with, the, boer, community, the, members, of, this, force, were, despised, as, traitors, by, the, boers, still, in, the, field, those, boers, who, attempted, to, remain, neutral, after, giving, their, parole, to, british, forces, were, derided, as, hensoppers, hands, uppers, and, were, often, coerced, into, giving, support, to, the, boer, guerrillas, which, formed, one, of, the, reasons, for, the, british, decision, to, launch, scorched, earth, campaigns, throughout, the, countryside, and, detain, boers, in, concentration, camps, in, order, to, deny, anything, of, use, to, the, boer, guerrillas, like, the, canadian, and, particularly, the, australian, and, new, zealand, contingents, many, of, the, volunteer, units, formed, by, south, africans, were, light, horse, or, mounted, infantry, well, suited, to, the, countryside, and, manner, of, warfare, some, regular, british, officers, scorned, their, comparative, lack, of, formal, discipline, but, the, light, horse, units, were, hardier, and, more, suited, to, the, demands, of, campaigning, than, the, overloaded, british, cavalry, who, were, still, obsessed, with, the, charge, by, lance, or, sabre, at, their, peak, 24, 000, south, africans, including, volunteers, from, the, empire, served, in, the, field, in, various, colonial, units, notable, units, in, addition, to, the, imperial, light, horse, were, the, south, african, light, horse, rimington, s, guides, kitchener, s, horse, and, the, imperial, light, infantry, harold, lothrop, borden, son, of, canada, s, canadian, minister, of, defence, and, militia, frederick, william, borden, serving, in, the, royal, canadian, dragoons, he, became, the, most, famous, canadian, casualty, of, the, second, boer, war, queen, victoria, asked, f, w, borden, for, a, photograph, of, his, son, prime, minister, wilfrid, laurier, praised, his, services, tributes, arrived, from, across, canada, and, in, his, home, town, canning, nova, scotia, there, is, a, monument, by, hamilton, maccarthy, erected, to, his, memory, sam, hughes, senior, militia, officer, and, later, a, federally, elected, cabinet, minister, hughes, became, involved, in, the, boer, war, as, a, member, of, brigadier, general, herbert, settle, s, expedition, after, hughes, unsuccessfully, tried, to, raise, his, own, brigade, of, soldiers, however, hughes, was, dismissed, and, was, sent, home, in, the, summer, of, 1900, for, sending, letters, back, home, which, were, published, outlining, british, command, incompetence, his, impatience, and, boastfulness, and, his, providing, surrendering, enemies, favourable, conditions, hughes, later, became, the, canadian, minister, of, defence, and, militia, in, 1911, just, prior, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, john, mccrae, best, known, as, the, author, of, the, world, war, i, poem, in, flanders, fields, mccrae, started, his, active, military, service, in, the, boer, war, as, an, artillery, officer, after, completing, several, major, campaigns, mccrae, s, artillery, unit, was, sent, home, to, canada, in, 1901, with, what, would,

guerrilla, warfare, after, the, war, was, over, the, entire, british, army, underwent, a, period, of, reform, which, was, focused, on, lessening, the, emphasis, placed, on, mounted, units, in, combat, it, was, determined, that, the, traditional, role, of, cavalry, was, antiquated, and, improperly, used, on, the, battlefield, in, the, modern, warfare, of, the, boer, war, and, that, the, first, world, war, was, the, final, proof, that, mounted, attacks, had, no, place, in, twentieth, century, combat, cavalry, was, put, to, better, use, after, the, reforms, in, the, theatres, of, the, middle, east, and, world, war, i, and, the, idea, of, mounted, infantry, was, useful, in, the, times, when, the, war, was, more, mobile, an, example, was, during, the, first, world, war, during, the, battle, of, mons, in, which, the, british, cavalry, held, the, belgian, town, against, an, initial, german, assault, another, was, the, use, of, mounted, infantry, at, the, battle, of, megiddo, 1918, in, which, allenby, s, force, routed, the, enemy, owing, to, speed, and, dexterity, of, arms, the, canadian, units, of, the, royal, canadian, dragoons, and, the, royal, canadian, mounted, rifles, fought, in, the, first, world, war, in, the, same, role, as, the, boer, war, however, during, and, after, the, second, world, war, the, regiments, swapped, their, horses, for, mechanised, vehicles, it, was, also, the, beginning, of, types, of, conflict, involving, machine, guns, shrapnel, and, observation, balloons, which, were, all, used, extensively, in, the, first, world, war, to, the, canadians, however, attrition, was, the, leading, cause, of, death, in, the, second, boer, war, with, disease, being, the, cause, of, approximately, half, of, the, canadian, deaths, both, sides, used, a, scorched, earth, policy, to, deprive, the, marching, enemy, of, food, and, both, had, to, corral, civilians, into, makeshift, huts, by, concentrating, them, into, camps, for, example, at, buffelspoort, british, soldiers, were, held, in, captivity, in, boer, encampments, after, surrendering, their, arms, and, civilians, were, often, mixed, in, with, service, personnel, because, the, boers, did, not, have, the, resources, to, do, otherwise, a, total, of, 116, 000, women, children, and, boer, soldiers, were, confined, to, the, commonwealth, concentration, camps, of, which, at, least, 28, 000, mainly, women, and, children, would, die, the, lack, of, food, water, and, sanitary, provisions, was, a, feature, of, 20th, century, warfare, for, both, civilians, and, armed, services, personnel, yet, one, consequence, of, the, boer, war, and, investigative, commissions, was, the, implementation, of, the, hague, convention, 1899, and, geneva, convention, 1904, of, which, there, were, many, further, agreements, thereafter, the, british, saw, their, tactics, of, scorched, earth, and, concentration, camps, as, a, legitimate, way, of, depriving, the, boer, guerrillas, of, supplies, and, safe, havens, the, boers, saw, them, as, a, british, attempt, to, coerce, the, boers, into, surrender, with, the, camp, inmates, mainly, families, of, boer, fighters, seen, as, deliberately, kept, in, poor, conditions, to, encourage, high, death, rates, even, in, 2019, the, controversy, around, the, british, tactics, continued, to, make, headlines, the, australian, national, boer, war, memorial, committee, organises, events, to, mark, the, war, on, 31, may, each, year, in, canberra, a, commemorative, service, is, usually, held, at, the, st, john, the, baptist, church, in,
