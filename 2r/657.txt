the, history, of, geography, includes, many, histories, of, geography, which, have, differed, over, time, and, between, different, cultural, and, political, groups, in, more, recent, developments, geography, has, become, a, distinct, academic, discipline, geography, derives, from, the, greek, geographia, literally, earth, writing, that, is, description, or, writing, about, the, earth, the, first, person, to, use, the, word, geography, was, eratosthenes, 276, 194, bc, however, there, is, evidence, for, recognizable, practices, of, geography, such, as, cartography, prior, to, the, use, of, the, term, the, known, world, of, ancient, egypt, saw, the, nile, as, the, center, and, the, world, as, based, upon, the, river, various, oasis, were, known, to, the, east, and, west, and, were, considered, locations, of, various, gods, e, g, siwa, for, amon, to, the, south, lay, the, kushitic, region, known, as, far, as, the, 4th, cataract, punt, was, a, region, south, along, the, shores, of, the, red, sea, various, asiatic, peoples, were, known, as, retenu, kanaan, que, harranu, or, khatti, hittites, at, various, times, especially, in, the, late, bronze, age, egyptians, had, diplomatic, and, trade, relationships, with, babylonia, and, elam, the, mediterranean, was, called, the, great, green, and, was, believed, to, be, part, of, a, world, encircling, ocean, europe, was, unknown, although, may, have, become, part, of, the, egyptian, world, view, in, phoenician, times, to, the, west, of, asia, lay, the, realms, of, keftiu, possibly, crete, and, mycenae, thought, to, be, part, of, a, chain, of, islands, that, joined, cyprus, crete, sicily, and, later, perhaps, sardinia, corsica, and, the, balearics, to, africa, the, oldest, known, world, maps, date, back, to, ancient, babylon, from, the, 9th, century, bc, the, best, known, babylonian, world, map, however, is, the, imago, mundi, of, 600, bc, the, map, as, reconstructed, by, eckhard, unger, shows, babylon, on, the, euphrates, surrounded, by, a, circular, landmass, showing, assyria, urartu, and, several, cities, in, turn, surrounded, by, a, bitter, river, oceanus, with, seven, islands, arranged, around, it, so, as, to, form, a, seven, pointed, star, the, accompanying, text, mentions, seven, outer, regions, beyond, the, encircling, ocean, the, descriptions, of, five, of, them, have, survived, in, contrast, to, the, imago, mundi, an, earlier, babylonian, world, map, dating, back, to, the, 9th, century, bc, depicted, babylon, as, being, further, north, from, the, center, of, the, world, though, it, is, not, certain, what, that, center, was, supposed, to, represent, the, ancient, greeks, viewed, homer, as, the, founder, of, geography, his, works, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, are, works, of, literature, but, both, contain, a, great, deal, of, geographical, information, homer, describes, a, circular, world, ringed, by, a, single, massive, ocean, the, works, show, that, the, greeks, by, the, 8th, century, bc, had, considerable, knowledge, of, the, geography, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, the, poems, contain, a, large, number, of, place, names, and, descriptions, but, for, many, of, these, it, is, uncertain, what, real, location, if, any, is, actually, being, referred, to, thales, of, miletus, is, one, of, the, first, known, philosophers, known, to, have, wondered, about, the, shape, of, the, world, he, proposed, that, the, world, was, based, on, water, and, that, all, things, grew, out, of, it, he, also, laid, down, many, of, the, astronomical, and, mathematical, rules, that, would, allow, geography, to, be, studied, scientifically, his, successor, anaximander, is, the, first, person, known, to, have, attempted, to, create, a, scale, map, of, the, known, world, and, to, have, introduced, the, gnomon, to, ancient, greece, hecataeus, of, miletus, initiated, a, different, form, of, geography, avoiding, the, mathematical, calculations, of, thales, and, anaximander, he, learnt, about, the, world, by, gathering, previous, works, and, speaking, to, the, sailors, who, came, through, the, busy, port, of, miletus, from, these, accounts, he, wrote, a, detailed, prose, account, of, what, was, known, of, the, world, a, similar, work, and, one, that, mostly, survives, today, is, herodotus, histories, while, primarily, a, work, of, history, the, book, contains, a, wealth, of, geographic, descriptions, covering, much, of, the, known, world, egypt, scythia, persia, and, asia, minor, are, all, described, including, a, mention, of, india, the, description, of, africa, as, a, whole, are, contentious, with, herodotus, describing, the, land, surrounded, by, a, sea, though, he, described, the, phoenicians, as, having, circumnavigated, africa, in, the, 6th, century, bc, through, much, of, later, european, history, the, indian, ocean, was, thought, to, be, an, inland, sea, the, southern, part, of, africa, wrapping, around, in, the, south, to, connect, with, the, eastern, part, of, asia, this, was, not, completely, abandoned, by, western, cartographers, until, the, circumnavigation, of, africa, by, vasco, da, gama, some, though, hold, that, the, descriptions, of, areas, such, as, india, are, mostly, imaginary, regardless, herodotus, made, important, observations, about, geography, he, is, the, first, to, have, noted, the, process, by, which, large, rivers, such, as, the, nile, build, up, deltas, and, is, also, the, first, recorded, as, observing, that, winds, tend, to, blow, from, colder, regions, to, warmer, ones, pythagoras, was, perhaps, the, first, to, propose, a, spherical, world, arguing, that, the, sphere, was, the, most, perfect, form, this, idea, was, embraced, by, plato, and, aristotle, presented, empirical, evidence, to, verify, this, he, noted, that, the, earth, s, shadow, during, a, lunar, eclipse, is, curved, from, any, angle, near, the, horizon, or, high, in, the, sky, and, also, that, stars, increase, in, height, as, one, moves, north, eudoxus, of, cnidus, used, the, idea, of, a, sphere, to, explain, how, the, sun, created, differing, climatic, zones, based, on, latitude, this, led, the, greeks, to, believe, in, a, division, of, the, world, into, five, regions, at, each, of, the, poles, was, an, uncharitably, cold, region, while, extrapolating, from, the, heat, of, the, sahara, it, was, deduced, that, the, area, around, the, equator, was, unbearably, hot, between, these, extreme, regions, both, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, had, a, temperate, belt, suitable, for, human, habitation, these, theories, clashed, with, the, evidence, of, explorers, however, hanno, the, navigator, had, traveled, as, far, south, as, sierra, leone, and, egyptian, pharaoh, necho, ii, of, africa, is, related, by, herodotus, and, others, as, having, commissioned, a, successful, circumnavigation, of, africa, by, phoenician, sailors, while, they, were, sailing, west, around, the, southern, tip, of, africa, it, was, found, that, the, sun, was, to, their, right, the, north, this, is, thought, to, have, been, a, key, trigger, in, the, realization, that, the, earth, is, spherical, in, the, classical, world, in, the, 4th, century, bc, the, greek, explorer, pytheas, traveled, through, northeast, europe, and, circled, the, british, isles, he, found, that, the, region, was, considerably, more, habitable, than, theory, expected, but, his, discoveries, were, largely, dismissed, by, his, contemporaries, because, of, this, conquerors, also, carried, out, exploration, for, example, caesar, s, invasions, of, britain, and, germany, expeditions, invasions, sent, by, augustus, to, arabia, felix, and, ethiopia, res, gestae, 26, and, perhaps, the, greatest, ancient, greek, explorer, of, all, alexander, the, great, who, deliberately, set, out, to, learn, more, about, the, east, through, his, military, expeditions, and, so, took, a, large, number, of, geographers, and, writers, with, his, army, who, recorded, their, observations, as, they, moved, east, the, ancient, greeks, divided, the, world, into, three, continents, europe, asia, and, libya, africa, the, hellespont, formed, the, border, between, europe, and, asia, the, border, between, asia, and, libya, was, generally, considered, to, be, the, nile, river, but, some, geographers, such, as, herodotus, objected, to, this, herodotus, argued, that, there, was, no, difference, between, the, people, on, the, east, and, west, sides, of, the, nile, and, that, the, red, sea, was, a, better, border, the, relatively, narrow, habitable, band, was, considered, to, run, from, the, atlantic, ocean, in, the, west, to, an, unknown, sea, somewhere, east, of, india, in, the, east, the, southern, portion, of, africa, was, unknown, as, was, the, northern, portion, of, europe, and, asia, so, it, was, believed, that, they, were, circled, by, a, sea, these, areas, were, generally, considered, uninhabitable, the, size, of, the, earth, was, an, important, question, to, the, ancient, greeks, eratosthenes, calculated, the, earth, s, circumference, with, great, precision, since, the, distance, from, the, atlantic, to, india, was, roughly, known, this, raised, the, important, question, of, what, was, in, the, vast, region, east, of, asia, and, to, the, west, of, europe, crates, of, mallus, proposed, that, there, were, in, fact, four, inhabitable, land, masses, two, in, each, hemisphere, in, rome, a, large, globe, was, created, depicting, this, world, posidonius, set, out, to, get, a, measurement, but, his, number, actually, was, considerably, smaller, than, the, real, one, yet, it, became, accepted, that, the, eastern, part, of, asia, was, not, a, huge, distance, from, europe, while, the, works, of, almost, all, earlier, geographers, have, been, lost, many, of, them, are, partially, known, through, quotations, found, in, strabo, 64, 63, bc, ca, ad, 24, strabo, s, seventeen, volume, work, of, geography, is, almost, completely, extant, and, is, one, of, the, most, important, sources, of, information, on, classical, geography, strabo, accepted, the, narrow, band, of, habitation, theory, and, rejected, the, accounts, of, hanno, and, pytheas, as, fables, none, of, strabo, s, maps, survive, but, his, detailed, descriptions, give, a, clear, picture, of, the, status, of, geographical, knowledge, of, the, time, pliny, the, elder, s, ad, 23, 79, natural, history, also, has, sections, on, geography, a, century, after, strabo, ptolemy, ad, 90, 168, launched, a, similar, undertaking, by, this, time, the, roman, empire, had, expanded, through, much, of, europe, and, previously, unknown, areas, such, as, the, british, isles, had, been, explored, the, silk, road, was, also, in, operation, and, for, the, first, time, knowledge, of, the, far, east, began, to, be, known, ptolemy, s, geographia, opens, with, a, theoretical, discussion, about, the, nature, and, techniques, of, geographical, inquiry, and, then, moves, to, detailed, descriptions, of, much, the, known, world, ptolemy, lists, a, huge, number, of, cities, tribes, and, sites, and, places, them, in, the, world, it, is, uncertain, what, ptolemy, s, names, correspond, to, in, the, modern, world, and, a, vast, amount, of, scholarship, has, gone, into, trying, to, link, ptolemaic, descriptions, to, known, locations, it, was, the, romans, who, made, far, more, extensive, practical, use, of, geography, and, maps, the, roman, transportation, system, consisting, of, 55, 000, miles, 89, 000, km, of, roads, could, not, have, been, designed, without, the, use, of, geographical, systems, of, measurement, and, triangulation, the, cursus, publicus, a, department, of, the, roman, government, devoted, to, transportation, employed, full, time, gromatici, surveyors, the, surveyors, job, was, to, gather, topographical, information, and, then, to, determine, the, straightest, possible, route, where, a, road, might, be, built, instruments, and, principles, used, included, sun, dials, for, determining, direction, theodolites, for, measuring, horizontal, angles, and, triangulation, without, which, the, creation, of, perfectly, straight, stretches, some, as, long, as, 35, miles, 56, km, would, have, been, impossible, during, the, greco, roman, era, those, who, performed, geographical, work, could, be, divided, into, four, categories, around, ad, 400, a, scroll, map, called, the, peutinger, table, was, made, of, the, known, world, featuring, the, roman, road, network, besides, the, roman, empire, which, at, that, time, spanned, from, britain, to, the, middle, east, and, africa, the, map, includes, india, sri, lanka, and, china, cities, are, demarcated, using, hundreds, of, symbols, it, measures, 1, 12, ft, 0, 34, m, high, and, 22, 15, ft, 6, 75, m, long, the, tools, and, principles, of, geography, used, by, the, romans, would, be, closely, followed, with, little, practical, improvement, for, the, next, 700, years, a, vast, corpus, of, indian, texts, embraced, the, study, of, geography, the, vedas, and, puranas, contain, elaborate, descriptions, of, rivers, and, mountains, and, treat, the, relationship, between, physical, and, human, elements, according, to, religious, scholar, diana, eck, a, notable, feature, of, geography, in, india, is, its, interweaving, with, hindu, mythology, no, matter, where, one, goes, in, india, one, will, find, a, landscape, in, which, mountains, rivers, forests, and, villages, are, elaborately, linked, to, the, stories, and, gods, of, indian, culture, every, place, in, this, vast, country, has, its, story, and, conversely, every, story, of, hindu, myth, and, legend, has, its, place, the, geographers, of, ancient, india, put, forward, theories, regarding, the, origin, of, the, earth, they, theorized, that, the, earth, was, formed, by, the, solidification, of, gaseous, matter, and, that, the, earth, s, crust, is, composed, of, hard, rocks, sila, clay, bhumih, and, sand, asma, theories, were, also, propounded, to, explain, earthquakes, bhukamp, and, it, was, assumed, that, earth, air, and, water, combined, to, cause, earthquakes, the, arthashastra, a, compendium, by, kautilya, also, known, as, chanakya, contains, a, range, of, geographical, and, statistical, information, about, the, various, regions, of, india, the, composers, of, the, puranas, divided, the, known, world, into, seven, continents, of, dwipas, jambu, dwipa, krauncha, dwipa, kusha, dwipa, plaksha, dwipa, pushkara, dwipa, shaka, dwipa, and, shalmali, dwipa, descriptions, were, provided, for, the, climate, and, geography, of, each, of, the, dwipas, the, vishnudharmottara, purana, compiled, between, 300, and, 350, ad, contains, six, chapters, on, physical, and, human, geography, the, locational, attributes, of, peoples, and, places, and, various, seasons, are, the, topics, of, these, chapters, var, hamihira, s, brihat, samhita, gave, a, thorough, treatment, of, planetary, movements, rainfall, clouds, and, the, formation, of, water, the, mathematician, astronomer, aryabhatiya, gave, a, precise, estimate, of, the, earth, s, circumference, in, his, treatise, ryabha, ya, aryabhata, accurately, calculated, the, earth, s, circumference, as, 24, 835, miles, which, was, only, 0, 2, smaller, than, the, actual, value, of, 24, 902, miles, the, mughal, chronicles, tuzuk, i, jehangiri, ain, i, akbari, and, dastur, ul, aml, contain, detailed, geographical, narratives, these, were, based, on, the, earlier, geographical, works, of, india, and, the, advances, made, by, medieval, muslim, geographers, particularly, the, work, of, alberuni, in, china, the, earliest, known, geographical, chinese, writing, dates, back, to, the, 5th, century, bc, during, the, beginning, of, the, warring, states, period, 481, bc, 221, bc, this, work, was, the, yu, gong, tribute, of, yu, chapter, of, the, shu, jing, or, book, of, documents, which, describes, the, traditional, nine, provinces, of, ancient, china, their, kinds, of, soil, their, characteristic, products, and, economic, goods, their, tributary, goods, their, trades, and, vocations, their, state, revenues, and, agricultural, systems, and, the, various, rivers, and, lakes, listed, and, placed, accordingly, the, nine, provinces, at, the, time, of, this, geographical, work, were, relatively, small, in, size, compared, to, those, of, modern, china, with, the, book, s, descriptions, pertaining, to, areas, of, the, yellow, river, the, lower, valleys, of, the, yangtze, and, the, plain, between, them, as, well, as, the, shandong, peninsula, and, to, the, west, the, most, northern, parts, of, the, wei, and, han, rivers, along, with, the, southern, parts, of, modern, day, shanxi, province, in, this, ancient, geographical, treatise, which, would, greatly, influence, later, chinese, geographers, and, cartographers, the, chinese, used, the, mythological, figure, of, yu, the, great, to, describe, the, known, earth, of, the, chinese, apart, from, the, appearance, of, yu, however, the, work, was, devoid, of, magic, fantasy, chinese, folklore, or, legend, although, the, chinese, geographical, writing, in, the, time, of, herodotus, and, strabo, were, of, lesser, quality, and, contained, less, systematic, approach, this, would, change, from, the, 3rd, century, onwards, as, chinese, methods, of, documenting, geography, became, more, complex, than, those, found, in, europe, a, state, of, affairs, that, would, persist, until, the, 13th, century, the, earliest, extant, maps, found, in, archeological, sites, of, china, date, to, the, 4th, century, bc, and, were, made, in, the, ancient, state, of, qin, the, earliest, known, reference, to, the, application, of, a, geometric, grid, and, mathematically, graduated, scale, to, a, map, was, contained, in, the, writings, of, the, cartographer, pei, xiu, 224, 271, from, the, 1st, century, ad, onwards, official, chinese, historical, texts, contained, a, geographical, section, which, was, often, an, enormous, compilation, of, changes, in, place, names, and, local, administrative, divisions, controlled, by, the, ruling, dynasty, descriptions, of, mountain, ranges, river, systems, taxable, products, etc, the, ancient, chinese, historian, ban, gu, 32, 92, most, likely, started, the, trend, of, the, gazetteer, in, china, which, became, prominent, in, the, northern, and, southern, dynasties, period, and, sui, dynasty, local, gazetteers, would, feature, a, wealth, of, geographic, information, although, its, cartographic, aspects, were, not, as, highly, professional, as, the, maps, created, by, professional, cartographers, from, the, time, of, the, 5th, century, bc, shu, jing, forward, chinese, geographical, writing, provided, more, concrete, information, and, less, legendary, element, this, example, can, be, seen, in, the, 4th, chapter, of, the, huainanzi, book, of, the, master, of, huainan, compiled, under, the, editorship, of, prince, liu, an, in, 139, bc, during, the, han, dynasty, 202, bc, 202, ad, the, chapter, gave, general, descriptions, of, topography, in, a, systematic, fashion, given, visual, aids, by, the, use, of, maps, di, tu, due, to, the, efforts, of, liu, an, and, his, associate, zuo, wu, in, chang, chu, s, hua, yang, guo, chi, historical, geography, of, sichuan, of, 347, not, only, rivers, trade, routes, and, various, tribes, were, described, but, it, also, wrote, of, a, ba, jun, tu, jing, map, of, sichuan, which, had, been, made, much, earlier, in, 150, the, shui, jing, waterways, classic, was, written, anonymously, in, the, 3rd, century, during, the, three, kingdoms, era, attributed, often, to, guo, pu, and, gave, a, description, of, some, 137, rivers, found, throughout, china, in, the, 6th, century, the, book, was, expanded, to, forty, times, its, original, size, by, the, geographers, li, daoyuan, given, the, new, title, of, shui, jing, zhu, the, waterways, classic, commented, in, later, periods, of, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, and, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, there, were, much, more, systematic, and, professional, approaches, to, geographic, literature, the, song, dynasty, poet, scholar, and, government, official, fan, chengda, 1126, 1193, wrote, the, geographical, treatise, known, as, the, gui, hai, yu, heng, chi, it, focused, primarily, on, the, topography, of, the, land, along, with, the, agricultural, economic, and, commercial, products, of, each, region, in, china, s, southern, provinces, the, polymath, chinese, scientist, shen, kuo, 1031, 1095, devoted, a, significant, amount, of, his, written, work, to, geography, as, well, as, a, hypothesis, of, land, formation, geomorphology, due, to, the, evidence, of, marine, fossils, found, far, inland, along, with, bamboo, fossils, found, underground, in, a, region, far, from, where, bamboo, was, suitable, to, grow, the, 14th, century, yuan, dynasty, geographer, na, xin, wrote, a, treatise, of, archeological, topography, of, all, the, regions, north, of, the, yellow, river, in, his, book, he, shuo, fang, gu, ji, the, ming, dynasty, geographer, xu, xiake, 1587, 1641, traveled, throughout, the, provinces, of, china, often, on, foot, to, write, his, enormous, geographical, and, topographical, treatise, documenting, various, details, of, his, travels, such, as, the, locations, of, small, gorges, or, mineral, beds, such, as, mica, schists, xu, s, work, was, largely, systematic, providing, accurate, details, of, measurement, and, his, work, translated, later, by, ding, wenjiang, read, more, like, a, 20th, century, field, surveyor, than, an, early, 17th, century, scholar, the, chinese, were, also, concerned, with, documenting, geographical, information, of, foreign, regions, far, outside, of, china, although, chinese, had, been, writing, of, civilizations, of, the, middle, east, india, and, central, asia, since, the, traveler, zhang, qian, 2nd, century, bc, later, chinese, would, provide, more, concrete, and, valid, information, on, the, topography, and, geographical, aspects, of, foreign, regions, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, chinese, diplomat, wang, xuance, traveled, to, magadha, modern, northeastern, india, during, the, 7th, century, afterwards, he, wrote, the, book, zhang, tian, zhu, guo, tu, illustrated, accounts, of, central, india, which, included, a, wealth, of, geographical, information, chinese, geographers, such, as, jia, dan, 730, 805, wrote, accurate, descriptions, of, places, far, abroad, in, his, work, written, between, 785, and, 805, he, described, the, sea, route, going, into, the, mouth, of, the, persian, gulf, and, that, the, medieval,

founded, the, balkh, school, of, terrestrial, mapping, in, baghdad, the, geographers, of, this, school, also, wrote, extensively, of, the, peoples, products, and, customs, of, areas, in, the, muslim, world, with, little, interest, in, the, non, muslim, realms, suhr, b, a, late, 10th, century, persian, geographer, accompanied, a, book, of, geographical, coordinates, with, instructions, for, making, a, rectangular, world, map, with, equirectangular, projection, or, cylindrical, equidistant, projection, in, the, early, 11th, century, avicenna, hypothesized, on, the, geological, causes, of,

projection, of, the, celestial, sphere, he, was, also, regarded, as, the, most, skilled, when, it, came, to, mapping, cities, and, measuring, the, distances, between, them, which, he, did, for, many, cities, in, the, middle, east, and, western, indian, subcontinent, he, combined, astronomical, readings, and, mathematical, equations, to, record, degrees, of, latitude, and, longitude, and, to, measure, the, heights, of, mountains, and, depths, of, valleys, recorded, in, the, chronology, of, the, ancient, nations, he, discussed, human, geography, and, the, planetary, habitability, of, the, earth, suggesting, that, roughly, a, quarter, of, the, earth, s, surface, is, habitable, by, humans, by, the, early, 12th, century, the, normans, had, overthrown, the, arabs, in, sicily, palermo, had, become, a, crossroads, for, travelers, and, traders, from, many, nations, and, the, norman, king, roger, ii, having, great, interest, in, geography, commissioned, the, creation, of, a, book, and, map, that, would, compile, all, this, wealth, of, geographical, information, researchers, were, sent, out, and, the, collection, of, data, took, 15, years, al, idrisi, one, of, few, arabs, who, had, ever, been, to, france, and, england, as, well, as, spain, central, asia, and, constantinople, was, employed, to, create, the, book, from, this, mass, of, data, utilizing, the, information, inherited, from, the, classical, geographers, he, created, one, of, the, most, accurate, maps, of, the, world, to, date, the, tabula, rogeriana, 1154, the, map, written, in, arabic, shows, the, eurasian, continent, in, its, entirety, and, the, northern, part, of, africa, an, adherent, of, environmental, determinism, was, the, medieval, afro, arab, writer, al, jahiz, 776, 869, who, explained, how, the, environment, can, determine, the, physical, characteristics, of, the, inhabitants, of, a, certain, community, he, used, his, early, theory, of, evolution, to, explain, the, origins, of, different, human, skin, colors, particularly, black, skin, which, he, believed, to, be, the, result, of, the, environment, he, cited, a, stony, region, of, black, basalt, in, the, northern, najd, as, evidence, for, his, theory, during, the, early, middle, ages, geographical, knowledge, in, europe, regressed, though, it, is, a, popular, misconception, that, they, thought, the, world, was, flat, and, the, simple, t, and, o, map, became, the, standard, depiction, of, the, world, the, trips, of, venetian, explorer, marco, polo, throughout, mongol, empire, in, the, 13th, century, the, christian, crusades, of, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, and, the, portuguese, and, spanish, voyages, of, exploration, during, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, opened, up, new, horizons, and, stimulated, geographic, writings, the, mongols, also, had, wide, ranging, knowledge, of, the, geography, of, europe, and, asia, based, in, their, governance, and, ruling, of, much, of, this, area, and, used, this, information, for, the, undertaking, of, large, military, expeditions, the, evidence, for, this, is, found, in, historical, resources, such, as, the, secret, history, of, mongols, and, other, persian, chronicles, written, in, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, for, example, during, the, rule, of, the, great, yuan, dynasty, a, world, map, was, created, and, is, currently, kept, in, south, korea, see, also, maps, of, the, yuan, dynasty, during, the, 15th, century, henry, the, navigator, of, portugal, supported, explorations, of, the, african, coast, and, became, a, leader, in, the, promotion, of, geographic, studies, among, the, most, notable, accounts, of, voyages, and, discoveries, published, during, the, 16th, century, were, those, by, giambattista, ramusio, in, venice, by, richard, hakluyt, in, england, and, by, theodore, de, bry, in, what, is, now, belgium, following, the, journeys, of, marco, polo, interest, in, geography, spread, throughout, europe, from, around, c, 1400, the, writings, of, ptolemy, and, his, successors, provided, a, systematic, framework, to, tie, together, and, portray, geographical, information, this, framework, was, used, by, academics, for, centuries, to, come, the, positives, being, the, lead, up, to, the, geographical, enlightenment, however, women, and, indigenous, writings, were, largely, excluded, from, the, discourse, the, european, global, conquests, started, in, the, early, 15th, century, with, the, first, portuguese, expeditions, to, africa, and, india, as, well, as, the, conquest, of, america, by, spain, in, 1492, and, continued, with, a, series, of, european, naval, expeditions, across, the, atlantic, and, later, the, pacific, and, russian, expeditions, to, siberia, until, the, 18th, century, european, overseas, expansion, led, to, the, rise, of, colonial, empires, with, the, contact, between, the, old, and, new, world, s, producing, the, columbian, exchange, a, wide, transfer, of, plants, animals, foods, human, populations, including, slaves, communicable, diseases, and, culture, between, the, continents, these, colonialist, endeavours, in, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, revived, a, desire, for, both, accurate, geographic, detail, and, more, solid, theoretical, foundations, the, geographia, generalis, by, bernhardus, varenius, and, gerardus, mercator, s, world, map, are, prime, examples, of, the, new, breed, of, scientific, geography, the, waldseem, ller, map, universalis, cosmographia, created, by, german, cartographer, martin, waldseem, ller, in, april, 1507, is, the, first, map, of, the, americas, in, which, the, name, america, is, mentioned, before, this, the, native, americans, referred, to, their, land, depending, on, their, location, with, one, of, the, more, commonly, used, terms, being, abya, yala, meaning, land, of, vital, blood, these, indigenous, geographical, discourses, were, largely, ignored, or, appropriated, by, the, european, colonialists, to, make, way, for, european, thought, the, eurocentric, map, was, patterned, after, a, modification, of, ptolemy, s, second, projection, but, expanded, to, include, the, americas, the, waldseemuller, map, has, been, called, america, s, birth, certificate, waldseem, ller, also, created, printed, maps, called, globe, gores, that, could, be, cut, out, and, glued, to, spheres, resulting, in, a, globe, this, has, been, debated, widely, as, being, dismissive, of, the, extensive, native, american, history, that, predated, the, 16th, century, invasion, in, the, sense, that, the, implication, of, a, birth, certificate, implies, a, blank, history, prior, geography, as, a, science, experiences, excitement, and, exerts, influence, during, the, scientific, revolution, and, reformation, in, the, victorian, period, the, oversea, exploration, gave, it, institutional, identity, and, geography, was, the, science, of, imperialism, par, excellence, imperialism, is, a, crucial, concept, for, the, europeans, as, the, institution, become, involved, in, geographical, exploration, and, colonial, project, authority, was, questioned, and, utility, gained, its, importance, in, the, era, of, enlightenment, geography, generated, knowledge, and, made, it, intellectually, and, practically, possible, as, a, university, discipline, the, natural, theology, required, geography, to, investigate, the, world, as, a, grand, machine, from, the, divine, scientific, voyages, and, travels, constructed, geopolitical, power, from, geographical, knowledge, partly, sponsored, by, royal, society, the, discourse, of, geographical, history, gave, way, to, many, new, thoughts, and, theories, but, the, hegemony, of, the, european, male, academia, led, to, the, exclusion, of, non, western, theories, observations, and, knowledges, one, such, example, is, the, interaction, between, humans, and, nature, with, marxist, thought, critiquing, nature, as, a, commodity, within, capitalism, european, thought, seeing, nature, as, either, a, romanticised, or, objective, concept, differing, to, human, society, and, native, american, discourse, which, saw, nature, and, humans, as, within, one, category, the, implied, hierarchy, of, knowledge, that, perpetuated, throughout, these, institutions, has, only, been, recently, challenged, with, the, royal, geographical, society, enabling, women, to, join, as, members,

scripture, to, experience, in, the, world, bartholom, us, keckermann, separated, geography, from, theology, because, the, general, workings, of, providence, required, empirical, investigation, his, follower, bernhardus, varenius, made, geography, a, science, in, the, 17th, century, and, published, geographia, generalis, which, was, used, in, newton, s, teaching, of, geography, at, cambridge, science, develops, along, with, empiricism, empiricism, gains, its, central, place, while, reflection, on, it, also, grew, practitioners, of, magic, and, astrology, first, embraced, and, expanded, geographical, knowledge, reformation, theology, focused, more, on, the, providence, than, the, creation, as, previously, realistic, experience, instead, of, translated, from, scripture, emerged, as, a, scientific, procedure, geographical, knowledge, and, method, play, roles, in, economic, education, and, administrative, application, as, part, of, the, puritan, social, program, foreign, travels, provided, content, for, geographic, research, and, formed, theories, such, as, environmentalism, cartography, showed, its, practical, theoretical, and, artistic, value, the, concepts, of, space, and, place, attract, attention, in, geography, why, things, are, there, and, not, elsewhere, is, an, important, topic, in, geography, together, with, debates, on, space, and, place, such, insights, could, date, back, in, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, identified, by, m, curry, as, natural, space, absolute, space, relational, space, on, space, and, spatial, practice, after, descartes, s, principles, of, philosophy, locke, and, leibniz, considered, space, as, relative, which, has, long, term, influence, on, the, modern, view, of, space, for, descartes, grassendi, and, newton, place, is, a, portion, of, absolution, space, which, are, neural, and, given, however, according, to, john, locke, our, idea, of, place, is, nothing, else, but, such, a, relative, position, of, any, thing, in, an, essay, concerning, human, understanding, distance, is, the, pivot, modification, of, space, because, space, considered, barely, in, length, between, any, two, beings, without, considering, any, thing, else, between, them, also, the, place, is, made, by, men, for, their, common, use, that, by, it, they, might, be, able, to, design, the, particular, position, of, things, in, the, fifth, paper, in, reply, to, clarke, leibniz, stated, men, fancy, places, traces, and, space, though, these, things, consist, only, in, the, truth, of, relations, and, not, at, all, in, any, absolute, reality, space, as, an, order, of, coexistence, can, only, be, an, ideal, thing, containing, a, certain, order, wherein, the, mind, conceives, the, application, of, relation, leibniz, moved, further, for, the, term, distance, as, he, discussed, it, together, with, interval, and, situation, not, just, a, measurable, character, leibniz, bridged, place, and, space, to, quality, and, quantity, by, saying, quantity, or, magnitude, is, that, in, things, which, can, be, known, only, through, their, simultaneous, compresence, or, by, their, simultaneous, perception, quality, on, the, other, hand, is, what, can, be, known, in, things, when, they, are, observed, singly, without, requiring, any, compresence, in, modern, space, as, relative, place, and, what, is, in, place, are, integrated, the, supremacy, of, space, is, observed, by, e, casey, when, the, place, is, resolved, as, position, and, even, point, by, leibniz, s, rationalism, and, locke, s, empiricism, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, advancements, in, science, mean, widening, human, knowledge, and, enable, further, exploiting, nature, along, with, industrialization, and, empire, expansion, in, europe, david, hume, the, real, father, of, positivist, philosophy, according, to, leszek, kolakowski, implied, the, doctrine, of, facts, emphasizing, the, importance, of, scientific, observations, the, fact, is, related, with, sensationalism, that, object, cannot, be, isolated, from, its, sense, perceptions, an, opinion, of, berkeley, galileo, descartes, later, hobbes, and, newton, advocated, scientific, materialism, viewing, the, universe, the, entire, world, and, even, human, mind, as, a, machine, the, mechanist, world, view, is, also, found, in, the, work, of, adam, smith, based, on, historical, and, statistics, methods, in, chemistry, antoine, lavoisier, proposed, the, exact, science, model, and, stressed, quantitative, methods, from, experiment, and, mathematics, carl, linnaeus, classified, plants, and, organisms, based, on, an, assumption, of, fixed, species, later, the, idea, of, evolution, emerged, not, only, for, species, but, also, for, society, and, human, intellect, in, general, natural, history, and, theory, of, the, heavens, kant, laid, out, his, hypothesis, of, cosmic, evolution, and, made, him, the, great, founder, of, the, modern, scientific, conception, of, evolution, according, to, hastie, francis, bacon, and, his, followers, believed, progress, of, science, and, technology, drive, betterment, of, man, this, belief, was, attached, by, jean, jacques, rousseau, who, defended, human, emotions, and, morals, his, discussion, on, geography, education, piloted, local, regional, studies, leibniz, and, kant, formed, the, major, challenge, to, the, mechanical, materialism, leibniz, conceptualized, the, world, as, a, changing, whole, rather, than, sum, of, its, parts, as, a, machine, nevertheless, he, acknowledged, experience, requires, rational, interpretation, the, power, of, human, reason, kant, tried, to, reconcile, the, division, of, sense, and, reason, by, stressing, moral, rationalism, grounded, on, aesthetic, experience, of, nature, as, order, harmony, and, unity, for, knowledge, kant, distinguished, phenomena, sensible, world, and, noumena, intelligible, world, and, he, asserted, all, phenomena, are, perceived, in, the, relations, of, space, and, time, drawing, a, line, between, rational, science, and, empirical, science, kant, regarded, physical, geography, associating, with, space, as, natural, science, during, his, tenure, in, k, nigsberg, kant, offered, lectures, on, physical, geography, since, 1756, and, published, the, lecture, notes, physische, geographie, in, 1801, however, kant, s, involvement, in, travel, and, geographical, research, is, fairly, limited, kant, s, work, on, empirical, and, rational, science, influence, humboldt, and, at, smaller, extent, ritter, manfred, b, ttner, asserted, that, is, kantian, emancipation, of, geography, from, theology, humboldt, is, admired, as, a, great, geographer, according, to, d, livingstone, that, modern, geography, was, first, and, last, a, synthesizing, science, and, as, such, if, goetzmann, is, to, be, believed, it, became, the, key, scientific, activity, of, the, age, humboldt, met, the, geographer, george, forster, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, whose, geographical, description, and, scientific, writing, influenced, humboldt, his, geognosia, including, the, geography, of, rocks, animals, and, plants, is, an, important, model, for, modern, geography, as, the, prussian, ministry, of, mines, humboldt, founded, the, free, royal, mining, school, at, steben, for, miners, later, regarded, the, prototype, of, such, institutes, german, naturphilosophie, especially, the, work, of, goethe, and, herder, stimulated, humboldt, s, idea, and, research, of, a, universal, science, in, his, letter, he, made, observations, while, his, attention, will, never, lose, sight, of, the, harmony, of, concurrent, forces, the, influence, of, the, inanimate, world, on, the, animal, and, vegetable, kingdom, his, american, travel, stressed, the, geography, of, plants, as, his, focus, of, science, meanwhile, humboldt, used, empirical, method, to, study, the, indigenous, people, in, the, new, world, regarded, as, a, most, important, work, in, human, geography, in, relation, historique, du, voyage, humboldt, called, these, research, a, new, science, physique, du, monde, theorie, de, la, terre, or, geographie, physique, during, 1825, to, 1859, humboldt, devoted, in, kosmos, which, is, about, the, knowledge, of, nature, there, are, growing, works, about, the, new, world, since, then, in, the, jeffersonian, era, american, geography, was, born, of, the, geography, of, america, meaning, the, knowledge, discovery, helped, form, the, discipline, practical, knowledge, and, national, pride, are, main, components, of, the, teleological, tradition, institutions, such, as, the, royal, geographical, society, indicate, geography, as, an, independent, discipline, mary, somerville, s, physical, geography, was, the, conceptual, culmination, of, baconian, ideal, of, universal, integration, according, to, francis, bacon, no, natural, phenomenon, can, be, adequately, studied, by, itself, alone, but, to, be, understood, it, must, be, considered, as, it, stands, connected, with, all, nature, by, the, 18th, century, geography, had, become, recognized, as, a, discrete, discipline, and, became, part, of, a, typical, university, curriculum, in, europe, especially, paris, and, berlin, although, not, in, the, united, kingdom, where, geography, was, generally, taught, as, a, sub, discipline, of, other, subjects, a, holistic, view, of, geography, and, nature, can, be, seen, in, the, work, by, the, 19th, century, polymath, alexander, von, humboldt, one, of, the, great, works, of, this, time, was, humboldt, s, kosmos, a, sketch, of, a, physical, description, of, the, universe, the, first, volume, of, which, was, published, in, german, in, 1845, such, was, the, power, of, this, work, that, dr, mary, somerville, of, cambridge, university, intended, to, scrap, publication, of, her, own, physical, geography, on, reading, kosmos, von, humboldt, himself, persuaded, her, to, publish, after, the, publisher, sent, him, a, copy, in, 1877, thomas, henry, huxley, published, his, physiography, with, the, philosophy, of, universality, presented, as, an, integrated, approach, in, the, study, of, the, natural, environment, the, philosophy, of, universality, in, geography, was, not, a, new, one, but, can, be, seen, as, evolving, from, the, works, of, alexander, von, humboldt, and, immanuel, kant, the, publication, of, huxley, physiography, presented, a, new, form, of, geography, that, analysed, and, classified, cause, and, effect, at, the, micro, level, and, then, applied, these, to, the, macro, scale, due, to, the, view, that, the, micro, was, part, of, the, macro, and, thus, an, understanding, of, all, the, micro, scales, was, need, to, understand, the, macro, level, this, approach, emphasized, the, empirical, collection, of, data, over, the, theoretical, the, same, approach, was, also, used, by, halford, john, mackinder, in, 1887, however, the, integration, of, the, geosphere, atmosphere, and, biosphere, under, physiography, was, soon, over, taken, by, davisian, geomorphology, over, the, past, two, centuries, the, quantity, of, knowledge, and, the, number, of, tools, has, exploded, there, are, strong, links, between, geography, and, the, sciences, of, geology, and, botany, as, well, as, economics, sociology, and, demographics, the, royal, geographical, society, was, founded, in, england, in, 1830, although, the, united, kingdom, did, not, get, its, first, full, chair, of, geography, until, 1917, the, first, real, geographical, intellect, to, emerge, in, united, kingdom, geography, was, halford, john, mackinder, appointed, reader, at, oxford, university, in, 1887, the, national, geographic, society, was, founded, in, the, united, states, in, 1888, and, began, publication, of, the, national, geographic, magazine, which, became, and, continues, to, be, a, great, popularizer, of, geographic, information, the, society, has, long, supported, geographic, research, and, education, in, the, west, during, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, and, the, 20th, century, the, discipline, of, geography, at, various, time, engaged, with, four, broad, themes, environmental, determinism, regional, geography, the, quantitative, revolution, and, critical, geography, environmental, determinism, is, the, theory, that, a, people, s, physical, mental, and, moral, habits, are, directly, due, to, the, influence, of, their, natural, environment, prominent, environmental, determinists, included, carl, ritter, ellen, churchill, semple, and, ellsworth, huntington, environmentally, deterministic, hypotheses, included, stereotypes, such, as, heat, makes, inhabitants, of, the, tropics, lazy, and, frequent, changes, in, barometric, pressure, make, inhabitants, of, temperate, latitudes, more, intellectually, agile, environmental, determinist, geographers, attempted, to, make, the, study, of, such, influences, scientific, around, the, 1930s, this, school, of, thought, was, widely, repudiated, as, lacking, any, basis, and, being, prone, to, often, bigoted, generalizations, environmental, determinism, remains, an, embarrassment, to, many, contemporary, geographers, and, leads, to, skepticism, among, many, of, them, of, claims, of, environmental, influence, on, culture, such, as, the, theories, of, jared, diamond, regional, geography, was, coined, by, a, group, of, geographers, known, as, possibilists, and, represented, a, reaffirmation, that, the, proper, topic, of, geography, was, study, of, places, regions, regional, geographers, focused, on, the, collection, of, descriptive, information, about, places, as, well, as, the, proper, methods, for, dividing, the, earth, up, into, regions, well, known, names, from, these, period, are, alfred, hettner, in, germany, and, paul, vidal, de, la, blache, in, france, the, philosophical, basis, of, this, field, in, united, states, was, laid, out, by, richard, hartshorne, who, defined, geography, as, a, study, of, areal, differentiation, which, later, led, to, criticism, of, this, approach, as, overly, descriptive, and, unscientific, however, the, concept, of, a, regional, geography, model, focused, on, area, studies, has, remained, incredibly, popular, amongst, students, of, geography, while, less, so, amongst, scholars, who, are, proponents, of, critical, geography, and, reject, a, regional, geography, paradigm, during, its, heyday, in, the, 1970s, through, the, early, 1990s, regional, geography, made, substantive, contributions, to, students, and, readers, understanding, of, foreign, cultures, and, the, real, world, effects, of, the, delineation, of, borders, the, quantitative, revolution, in, geography, began, in, the, 1950s, geographers, formulated, geographical, theories, and, subjected, the, theories, to, empirical, tests, usually, using, statistical, methods, especially, hypothesis, testing, this, quantitative, revolution, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, development, of, geographic, information, systems, well, known, geographers, from, this, period, are, fred, k, schaefer, waldo, tobler, william, garrison, peter, haggett, richard, j, chorley, william, bunge, edward, augustus, ackerman, and, torsten, h, gerstrand, an, important, concept, that, emerged, from, this, is, the, first, law, of, geography, proposed, by, waldo, tobler, which, states, that, everything, is, related, to, everything, else, but, near, things, are, more, related, than, distant, things, the, term, critical, geography, has, been, in, use, since, at, least, 1749, when, the, book, geography, reformed, a, new, system, of, general, geography, according, to, an, accurate, analysis, of, the, science, in, four, parts, dedicated, a, chapter, to, the, topic, titled, of, critical, geography, this, chapter, described, critical, geography, as, an, approach, geographers, take, to, build, upon, the, work, of, others, and, make, corrections, to, their, maps, based, on, new, information, in, the, 1970s, the, term, saw, a, resurgence, as, so, called, radical, geographers, took, on, the, framework, of, critical, theory, and, marxist, philosophy, using, critical, geography, as, an, umbrella, uniting, various, theoretical, frameworks, in, geography, including, marxist, geography, and, feminist, geography, critical, geography, re, emerged, within, the, discipline, in, part, as, a, radical, critique, of, positivist, approaches, that, gained, popularity, during, the, quantitative, revolution, the, first, strain, of, critical, geography, to, emerge, was, humanistic, geography, drawing, on, the, philosophies, of, existentialism, and, phenomenology, humanistic, geographers, such, as, yi, fu, tuan, focused, on, people, s, sense, of, and, relationship, with, places, more, influential, was, marxist, geography, which, applied, the, social, theories, of, karl, marx, and, his, followers, to, geographic, phenomena, david, harvey, milton, santos, and, richard, peet, are, well, known, marxist, geographers, feminist, geography, is, as, the, name, suggests, the, use, of, ideas, from, feminism, in, geographic, contexts, the, most, recent, strain, of, critical, geography, is, postmodernist, geography, which, employs, the, ideas, of, postmodernist, and, poststructuralist, theorists, to, explore, the, social, construction, of, spatial, relations, critical, geography, is, often, viewed, as, directly, opposed, to, the, positive, approaches, during, the, 20th, century, and, quantitative, geographers, have, levied, counter, criticisms, some, argue, the, rise, in, critical, geography, was, in, response, to, the, difficulty, in, understanding, the, new, techniques, and, technology, and, that, the, early, criticisms, of, these, technologies, critical, geographers, put, forth, in, the, 20th, century, have, been, addressed, by, advances, in, computers, critical, geography, has, been, called, anti, science, after, an, initial, debate, on, the, merits, of, positivism, where, critical, geographers, attempted, to, excise, everything, that, went, before, in, quantitative, geography, and, overthrow, the, dominant, quantitative, approach, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, by, 1995, gis, practitioners, and, quantitative, geographers, began, to, decline, comment, to, critical, geography, in, an, academic, context, while, quantitative, geographers, and, critical, geographers, continued, to, work, together, in, some, context, a, lack, of, common, vocabulary, and, rounds, of, polarizing, debates, lead, to, a, situation, of, mutual, indifference, and, absence, of, dialog, between, the, two, groups, during, the, 2000s, the, result, of, this, split, led, to, the, creation, of, two, camps, within, human, geography, that, many, view, as, irreconcilable, described, by, geographer, mei, po, kwan, as, the, social, cultural, geographies, and, the, spatial, analytical, geographies
