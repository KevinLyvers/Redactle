an, important, active, role, in, adapting, to, the, dominant, chinese, structure, rather, than, being, forcibly, subjugated, for, instance, the, aboriginal, chief, lady, xian, who, married, the, liang, court, s, governor, feng, bao, helped, to, extend, the, dynasties, authority, while, preserving, autonomy, and, local, culture, lady, xian, and, feng, bao, played, a, critical, role, in,

the, sixteen, kingdoms, capturing, shandong, henan, and, briefly, guanzhong, by, 416, he, gave, up, guanzhong, to, try, to, take, the, throne, because, he, believed, in, a, prophecy, saying, there, would, be, one, more, emperor, after, emperor, an, he, deposed, the, former, and, soon, afterwards, his, replacement, emperor, gong, in, 420, ending, the, eastern, jin, dynasty, even, after, crowning, himself, emperor, wu, liu, yu, remained, frugal, however, he, did, not, care, for, education, and, trusted, unsavory, people, he, felt, that, the, nobility, had, too, much, power, so, he, tended, to, appoint, the, lower, classes, to, government, positions, and, gave, military, power, to, imperial, kinsmen, ironically, because, the, imperial, kinsmen, stabilized, their, military, power, and, wished, to, gain, political, power, emperor, wu, was, afraid, they, would, have, thoughts, of, usurping, the, throne, thus, he, also, frequently, killed, his, kinsmen, after, the, death, of, emperor,

smaller, local, powers, to, defeat, the, northern, wei, the, north, and, south, were, forced, into, tacitly, acknowledging, their, equal, status, for, example, by, granting, each, other, the, highest, positions, as, the, most, esteemed, envoys, as, the, wei, shu, and, song, shu, testify, there, was, a, shift, from, imperial, rhetoric, denouncing, the, other, side, as, illegitimate, barbarians, towards, a, new, conception, referring, to, the, two, as, distinct, northern, and, southern, parallels, using, unique, local, customs, to, distinguish, themselves, and, compete, for, legitimacy, it, was, during, the, northern, and, southern, dynasties, period, that, the, earliest, recorded, mass, migration, of, ethnic, han, to, southern, china, south, of, the, yangtze, river, took, place, this, sinicisation, helped, to, develop, the, region, from, its, previous, state, of, being, inhabited, by, isolated, communities, separated, by, vast, uncolonized, wilderness, and, other, non, han, ethnic, groups, during, this, period, the, south, went, from, being, nearly, a, frontier, to, being, on, a, path, to, the, thriving, urbanized, sinicized, region, that, it, became, in, later, centuries, in, his, book, buddhism, in, chinese, history, arthur, f, wright, points, out, this, fact, by, stating, when, we, speak, of, the, area, of, the, yangtze, valley, and, below, in, the, period, of, disunion, we, must, banish, from, our, minds, the, picture, of, the, densely, populated, intensively, cultivated, south, china, of, recent, centuries, when, the, aristocrats, of, the, remnants, of, the, chin, ruling, house, fled, to, the, nanking, area, early, in, the, 4th, century, the, south, contained, perhaps, a, tenth, of, the, population, of, china, there, were, centers, of, chinese, culture, and, administration, but, around, most, of, these, lay, vast, uncolonized, areas, into, which, chinese, settlers, were, slow, to, move, during, the, northern, and, southern, dynasties, the, yangtze, valley, transformed, from, a, backwater, frontier, region, with, less, than, 25, of, china, s, population, to, a, major, cultural, center, of, china, with, 40, of, china, s, population, and, after, china, was, subsequently, unified, under, the, tang, dynasty, they, became, the, core, area, of, chinese, culture, when, the, jin, court, fled, south, they, continued, to, speak, in, the, refined, common, language, tongyu, from, the, central, plains, in, the, north, which, was, regarded, as, highly, prestigious, however, many, local, southern, chinese, resisted, adopting, the, speech, of, the, newcomers, during, the, southern, dynasties, period, beginning, in, the, mid, 4th, century, and, spreading, widely, by, the, 5th, century, elite, northern, emigres, and, southern, locals, around, the, capital, of, jiankang, developed, a, new, elite, speech, form, with, clearly, distinctive, pronunciation, and, phrasing, that, set, it, apart, from, the, central, plains, speech, however, some, of, the, emigres, also, resisted, this, new, trend, to, prize, the, speech, of, wu, which, they, regarded, as, seductive, and, frivolous, meanwhile, the, process, of, han, chinese, courtiers, learning, xianbei, and, xianbei, learning, chinese, led, to, the, court, speech, of, the, north, changing, as, well, by, the, 6th, century, southern, elites, looked, down, on, the, accent, of, luoyang, as, crude, and, clumsy, confucianism, s, unchallenged, domination, of, chinese, culture, and, thought, was, greatly, weakened, during, the, jin, dynasty, which, led, to, a, wide, diversification, of, political, thought, and, philosophy, by, the, time, of, the, northern, and, southern, dynasties, this, era, produced, a, myriad, of, writers, that, advocated, practical, systems, of, governance, and, administration, such, as, cao, cao, and, zhuge, liang, in, the, three, kingdoms, period, wang, dao, and, bao, jingyan, of, the, eastern, jin, as, well, as, fan, zhen, xing, shao, chinese, and, fan, xun, chinese, of, the, northern, and, southern, period, much, of, the, philosophy, of, the, period, is, despondent, and, dispirited, and, a, number, of, scholars, and, poets, became, reclusive, mountain, hermits, living, apart, from, society, of, these, various, trends, the, most, influential, was, neo, daoism, chinese, pinyin, xu, nxu, neo, daoism, was, highly, influential, during, the, southern, dynasty, to, the, point, that, emperor, wen, of, liu, song, established, a, neo, daoist, academy, and, promoted, it, along, with, confucianism, literature, and, history, as, the, four, great, subjects, of, study, a, phenomenon, known, as, empty, chat, chinese, pinyin, q, ng, t, n, became, common, where, educated, men, would, meet, and, talk, about, philosophy, all, day, without, paying, any, attention, to, mundane, things, such, as, their, profession, or, family, the, phenomenon, gradually, waned, during, the, sui, dynasty, though, it, did, not, fully, disappear, until, the, tang, dynasty, literature, was, particularly, vibrant, during, the, southern, dynasty, and, tended, to, be, flowery, and, frilly, while, northern, dynasty, literature, was, rougher, and, more,

jettisoning, cares, and, anxiety, poets, of, the, northern, and, southern, dynasties, focused, on, imitating, older, classical, poets, of, ancient, china, formalizing, the, rhyme, patterns, and, meters, that, governed, poem, composition, however, scholars, realized, that, ancient, songs, and, poems, like, those, of, the, shijing, in, many, instances, no, longer, rhymed, due, to, sound,
