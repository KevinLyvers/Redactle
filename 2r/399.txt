latin, contrareformatio, also, sometimes, called, the, catholic, revival, was, the, period, of, catholic, resurgence, that, was, initiated, in, response, to, and, as, an, alternative, to, the, protestant, reformations, at, the, time, it, is, frequently, dated, to, have, begun, with, the, council, of, trent, 1545, 1563, and, to, end, with, the, conclusion, of, the, european, wars, of, religion, in, 1648, though, this, is, controversial, the, broader, term, catholic, reformation, latin, reformatio, catholica, also, encompasses, reforms, and, movements, within, the, church, in, the, periods, immediately, before, protestantism, or, trent, and, lasting, later, initiated, in, part, to, address, the, challenges, of, the, protestant, reformations, the, counter, reformation, was, a, comprehensive, effort, arising, from, the, decrees, of, the, council, of, trent, the, effort, produced, apologetic, and, polemical, documents, heresy, trials, anti, corruption, efforts, spiritual, movements, the, promotion, of, new, religious, orders, and, the, flourishing, of, new, art, and, musical, styles, such, policies, e, g, by, the, imperial, diets, of, the, holy, roman, empire, had, long, lasting, effects, in, european, history, with, exiles, of, protestants, continuing, until, the, 1781, patent, of, toleration, although, smaller, expulsions, took, place, in, the, 19th, century, such, reforms, included, the, foundation, of, seminaries, for, the, proper, training, of, priests, in, the, spiritual, life, and, the, theological, traditions, of, the, church, the, reform, of, religious, life, by, returning, orders, to, their, spiritual, foundations, and, new, spiritual, movements, focusing, on, the, devotional, life, and, a, personal, relationship, with, christ, including, the, spanish, mystics, and, the, french, school, of, spirituality, it, also, involved, political, activities, and, used, the, regional, inquisitions, a, primary, emphasis, of, the, counter, reformation, was, a, mission, to, reach, parts, of, the, world, that, had, been, colonized, as, predominantly, catholic, and, also, try, to, reconvert, nations, such, as, sweden, and, england, that, once, were, catholic, from, the, time, of, the, christianisation, of, europe, but, had, been, lost, to, the, reformation, various, counter, reformation, theologians, focused, only, on, defending, doctrinal, positions, such, as, the, sacraments, and, pious, practices, that, were, attacked, by, the, protestant, reformers, up, to, the, second, vatican, council, in, 1962, 1965, counter, reformation, is, a, translation, of, german, gegenreformation, 33, protestant, historians, have, tended, to, speak, in, terms, of, catholic, reform, as, part, of, the, counter, reformation, itself, a, response, to, the, reformation, in, nineteenth, century, germany, the, term, became, part, of, the, german, kulturkampf, counter, reformation, was, used, by, protestant, historians, as, a, negative, and, one, dimensional, concept, that, stressed, the, aspect, of, reaction, and, resistance, to, protestantism, and, neglected, that, of, reform, within, catholicism, the, term, was, understandably, shunned, by, catholic, historians, even, when, the, protestant, historian, wilhelm, maurenbrecher, introduced, the, term, catholic, reformation, in, 1880, german, historiography, remained, confessionally, divided, on, the, subject, the, term, catholic, reformation, appealed, to, catholic, historians, because, it, offered, them, the, possibility, of, avoiding, the, term, counter, reformation, with, its, problematic, connotation, of, a, mere, reaction, to, protestantism, but, it, was, rejected, by, protestant, historians, largely, because, they, did, not, want, the, term, reformation, to, be, used, for, anything, other, than, the, protestant, reformation, 33, catholic, historians, tend, to, emphasize, them, as, different, the, french, historian, henri, daniel, rops, wrote, the, term, counter, reformation, however, though, common, is, misleading, it, cannot, rightly, be, applied, logically, or, chronologically, to, that, sudden, awakening, as, of, a, startled, giant, that, wonderful, effort, of, rejuvenation, and, reorganization, which, in, a, space, of, thirty, years, gave, to, the, church, an, altogether, new, appearance, the, so, called, counter, reformation, did, not, begin, with, the, council, of, trent, long, after, luther, its, origins, and, initial, achievements, were, much, anterior, to, the, fame, of, wittenberg, it, was, undertaken, not, by, way, of, answering, the, reformers, but, in, obedience, to, demands, and, principles, that, are, part, of, the, unalterable, tradition, of, the, church, and, proceed, from, her, most, fundamental, loyalties, the, italian, historian, massimo, firpo, has, distinguished, catholic, reformation, from, counter, reformation, by, their, issues, in, his, view, the, general, catholic, reformation, was, centered, on, the, care, of, souls, episcopal, residence, the, renewal, of, the, clergy, together, with, the, charitable, and, educational, roles, of, the, new, religious, orders, whereas, the, specific, counter, reformation, was, founded, upon, the, defence, of, orthodoxy, the, repression, of, dissent, the, reassertion, of, ecclesiastical, authority, other, relevant, terms, that, may, be, encountered, the, 14th, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, saw, a, spiritual, revival, in, europe, incubated, by, the, rise, of, preaching, friars, the, standardization, of, the, paris, bible, lay, spiritual, movements, such, as, the, devotio, moderna, the, examples, of, nascent, saints, such, as, catherine, of, bologna, antoninus, of, florence, rita, of, cascia, and, catherine, of, genoa, printing, christian, humanism, an, urbanized, laity, who, could, not, flee, the, towns, for, monasteries, 130, and, other, reasons, a, series, of, ecumenical, councils, were, held, with, reformist, agendas, the, kinds, of, positive, reforms, considered, were, not, necessarily, the, ones, that, pre, occupied, the, hussites, e, g, communion, under, both, kinds, married, priests, and, later, protestants, e, g, indulgences, justification, ending, schism, and, war, especially, papal, war, was, regarded, by, some, prelates, as, the, pre, condition, for, reformation, 174, at, times, the, reform, talk, in, the, councils, tended, to, lack, enough, specificity, to, result, in, an, effective, program, except, for, a, tendency, to, follow, the, observantist, faction, of, the, monastic, orders, that, less, slackness, regarding, external, observances, would, aid, fervour, in, internal, piety, or, to, promote, a, top, down, head, and, body, institution, centric, focus, ii, that, reform, needed, to, start, at, and, from, the, pope, or, bishops, or, councils, or, princes, or, canon, law, there, was, considerable, support, for, the, evangelical, counsels, ideal, of, poverty, as, a, way, to, short, circuit, careerism, though, john, wycliffe, s, doctrine, of, mandatory, apostolic, poverty, was, decisively, rejected, at, the, council, of, constance, issues, such, as, papal, nepotism, and, the, wealth, dioscese, absenteeism, and, pre, occupation, with, secular, power, of, important, bishops, were, recognized, as, perennial, and, scandalous, problems, these, resisted, serious, reform, by, successive, popes, and, councils, with, those, bishops, unable, to, compromise, their, own, interests, for, centuries, causing, friction, as, radical, reformers, periodically, arose, in, response, such, as, savonarola, ch, 1, in, the, half, century, before, the, reformation, the, phenomenon, of, bishops, closing, down, decadent, monasteries, or, convents, had, become, more, common, as, had, programs, to, educate, parish, priests, ch, 1, in, the, half, century, before, the, council, of, trent, various, evangelical, catholic, leaders, had, experimented, with, reforms, that, came, to, be, associated, with, protestants, for, example, guillaume, bri, onnet, bishop, of, meaux, in, paris, with, his, former, teacher, jacques, lef, vre, d, etaples, had, statues, other, than, christ, removed, from, his, churches, though, not, destroyed, replaced, the, hail, mary, with, the, pater, noster, prayer, and, made, available, vernacular, french, versions, of, the, gospels, and, epistles, ch, 1, conservative, and, reforming, parties, still, survived, within, the, catholic, church, even, as, the, protestant, reformations, spread, protestants, decisively, broke, from, the, catholic, church, in, the, 1520s, the, two, distinct, dogmatic, positions, within, the, catholic, church, solidified, in, the, 1560s, the, regular, orders, made, their, first, attempts, at, reform, in, the, 14th, century, the, benedictine, bull, of, 1336, reformed, the, benedictines, and, cistercians, in, 1523, the, camaldolese, hermits, of, monte, corona, were, recognized, as, a, separate, congregation, of, monks, in, 1435, francis, of, paola, founded, the, poor, hermits, of, saint, francis, of, assisi, who, became, the, minim, friars, in, 1526, matteo, de, bascio, suggested, reforming, the, franciscan, rule, of, life, to, its, original, purity, giving, birth, to, the, capuchins, recognized, by, the, pope, in, 1619, this, order, was, well, known, to, the, laity, and, played, an, important, role, in, public, preaching, to, respond, to, the, new, needs, of, evangelism, clergy, formed, into, religious, congregations, taking, special, vows, but, with, no, obligation, to, assist, in, a, monastery, s, religious, offices, these, regular, clergy, taught, preached, and, took, confession, but, were, under, a, bishop, s, direct, authority, and, not, linked, to, a, specific, parish, or, area, like, a, vicar, or, canon, in, italy, the, first, congregation, of, regular, clergy, was, the, theatines, founded, in, 1524, by, gaetano, and, cardinal, gian, caraffa, this, was, followed, by, the, somaschi, fathers, in, 1528, the, barnabites, in, 1530, the, ursulines, in, 1535, the, jesuits, canonically, recognised, in, 1540, the, clerics, regular, of, the, mother, of, god, of, lucca, in, 1583, the, camillians, in, 1584, the, adorno, fathers, in, 1588, and, finally, the, piarists, in, 1621, at, the, end, of, the, 1400s, a, reform, movement, inspired, by, st, catherine, of, genoa, s, hospital, ministry, started, spreading, in, rome, starting, 1514, the, oratory, of, divine, love, attracted, an, aristocratic, membership, of, priests, and, laymen, to, perform, anonymous, acts, of, charity, and, to, discuss, reform, the, members, subsequently, became, the, key, players, in, the, church, handling, the, reformation, in, 1548, then, layman, philip, neri, founded, a, confraternity, of, the, most, holy, trinity, of, pilgrims, and, convalescents, this, developed, into, the, relatively, free, religious, community, the, oratorians, who, were, given, their, constitutions, in, 1564, and, recognized, as, a, religious, order, by, the, pope, in, 1575, they, used, music, and, singing, to, attract, the, faithful, key, events, of, the, period, include, the, council, of, trent, 1545, 1563, the, excommunication, of, elizabeth, i, 1570, the, codification, of, the, uniform, roman, rite, mass, 1570, and, the, battle, of, lepanto, 1571, occurring, during, the,

the, 1530, confutatio, augustana, was, the, catholic, response, to, the, lutheran, augsburg, confession, pope, paul, iii, 1534, 1549, is, considered, the, first, pope, of, the, counter, reformation, and, he, also, initiated, the, council, of, trent, 1545, 1563, tasked, with, institutional, reform, addressing, contentious, issues, such, as, corrupt, bishops, and, priests, the, sale, of, indulgences, and, other, financial, abuses, the, council, upheld, the, basic, structure, of, the, medieval, church, its, sacramental, system, religious, orders, and, doctrine, it, recommended, that, the, form, of, mass, should, be, standardised, and, this, took, place, in, 1570, when, pope, pius, v, made, the, tridentine, mass, obligatory, it, rejected, all, compromise, with, protestants, restating, basic, tenets, of, the, catholic, faith, the, council, upheld, salvation, appropriated, by, grace, through, faith, and, works, of, that, faith, not, just, by, faith, as, the, protestants, insisted, because, faith, without, works, is, dead, as, the, epistle, of, james, states, 2, 22, 26, transubstantiation, according, to, which, the, consecrated, bread, and, wine, are, held, to, have, been, transformed, really, and, substantially, into, the, body, blood, soul, and, divinity, of, christ, was, also, reaffirmed, as, were, the, traditional, seven, sacraments, of, the, catholic, church, other, practices, that, drew, the, ire, of, protestant, reformers, such, as, pilgrimages, the, veneration, of, saints, and, relics, the, use, of, venerable, images, and, statuary, and, the, veneration, of, the, virgin, mary, were, strongly, reaffirmed, as, spiritually, commendable, practices, the, council, in, the, canon, of, trent, officially, accepted, the, vulgate, listing, of, the, old, testament, bible, which, included, the, deuterocanonical, works, called, apocrypha, by, protestants, on, a, par, with, the, 39, books, found, in, the, masoretic, text, this, reaffirmed, the, previous, council, of, rome, and, synods, of, carthage, both, held, in, the, 4th, century, ad, which, had, affirmed, the, deuterocanon, as, scripture, the, council, also, commissioned, the, roman, catechism, which, served, as, authoritative, church, teaching, until, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, 1992, while, the, traditional, fundamentals, of, the, church, were, reaffirmed, there, were, noticeable, changes, to, answer, complaints, that, the, counter, reformers, were, tacitly, willing, to, admit, were, legitimate, among, the, conditions, to, be, corrected, by, catholic, reformers, was, the, growing, divide, between, the, clerics, and, the, laity, many, members, of, the, clergy, in, the, rural, parishes, had, been, poorly, educated, often, these, rural, priests, did, not, know, latin, and, lacked, opportunities, for, proper, theological, training, addressing, the, education, of, priests, had, been, a, fundamental, focus, of, the, humanist, reformers, in, the, past, parish, priests, were, to, be, better, educated, in, matters, of, theology, and, apologetics, while, papal, authorities, sought, to, educate, the, faithful, about, the, meaning, nature, and, value, of, art, and, liturgy, particularly, in, monastic, churches, protestants, had, criticised, them, as, distracting, handbooks, became, more, common, describing, how, to, be, good, priests, and, confessors, thus, the, council, of, trent, attempted, to, improve, the, discipline, and, administration, of, the, church, the, worldly, excesses, of, the, secular, renaissance, church, epitomized, by, the, era, of, alexander, vi, 1492, 1503, intensified, during, the, reformation, under, pope, leo, x, 1513, 1521, whose, campaign, to, raise, funds, for, the, construction, of, saint, peter, s, basilica, by, supporting, use, of, indulgences, served, as, a, key, impetus, for, martin, luther, s, 95, theses, the, catholic, church, responded, to, these, problems, by, a, vigorous, campaign, of, reform, inspired, by, earlier, catholic, reform, movements, humanism, devotionalism, and, observantism, the, council, by, virtue, of, its, actions, repudiated, the, pluralism, of, the, secular, renaissance, that, had, previously, plagued, the, church, the, organization, of, religious, institutions, was, tightened, discipline, was, improved, and, the, parish, was, emphasized, the, appointment, of, bishops, for, political, reasons, was, no, longer, tolerated, in, the, past, the, large, landholdings, forced, many, bishops, to, be, absent, bishops, who, at, times, were, property, managers, trained, in, administration, thus, the, council, of, trent, combated, absenteeism, which, was, the, practice, of, bishops, living, in, rome, or, on, landed, estates, rather, than, in, their, dioceses, the, council, of, trent, gave, bishops, greater, power, to, supervise, all, aspects, of, religious, life, zealous, prelates, such, as, milan, s, archbishop, carlo, borromeo, 1538, 1584, later, canonized, as, a, saint, set, an, example, by, visiting, the, remotest, parishes, and, instilling, high, standards, the, 1559, 1967, index, librorum, prohibitorum, was, a, directory, of, prohibited, books, which, was, updated, twenty, times, during, the, next, four, centuries, as, books, were, added, or, removed, from, the, list, by, the, sacred, congregation, of, the, index, it, was, divided, into, three, classes, the, first, class, listed, heretical, writers, the, second, class, listed, heretical, works, and, the, third, class, listed, forbidden, writings, which, were, published, without, the, name, of, the, author, the, index, was, finally, suspended, on, 29, march, 1967, the, 1566, roman, catechism, provided, material, in, latin, to, help, the, clergy, catechize, in, the, vernacular, the, 1575, nova, ordinantia, ecclesiastica, was, an, addendum, to, the, liturgia, svecan, ecclesi, catholic, orthodox, conformia, also, called, the, red, book, this, launched, the, liturgical, struggle, which, pitted, john, iii, of, sweden, against, his, younger, brother, charles, during, this, time, jesuit, laurentius, nicolai, came, to, lead, the, collegium, regium, stockholmense, this, theatre, of, the, counter, reformation, was, called, the, missio, suetica, the, 1578, defensio, tridentin, fidei, was, the, catholic, response, to, the, examination, of, the, council, of, trent, the, 1713, papal, bull, unigenitus, condemned, 101, propositions, of, the, french, jansenist, theologian, pasquier, quesnel, 1634, 1719, jansenism, was, a, protestant, leaning, or, mediating, movement, within, catholicism, in, france, and, the, spanish, netherlands, that, was, criticized, for, being, crypto, calvinist, denying, that, christ, died, for, all, promoting, that, holy, communion, should, be, received, very, infrequently, and, more, after, jansenist, propositions, were, condemned, it, led, to, the, development, of, the, old, catholic, church, of, the, netherlands, when, the, calvinists, took, control, of, various, parts, of, the, netherlands, in, the, dutch, revolt, the, catholics, led, by, philip, ii, of, spain, fought, back, the, king, sent, in,

the, main, cities, in, the, south, the, future, belgium, and, returned, them, to, the, control, of, catholic, spain, he, took, advantage, of, the, divisions, in, the, ranks, of, his, opponents, between, the, dutch, speaking, flemish, and, the, french, speaking, walloons, using, persuasion, to, take, advantage, of, the, divisions, and, foment, the, growing, discord, by, doing, so, he, was, able, to, bring, back, the, walloon, provinces, to, an, allegiance, to, the, king, by, the, treaty, of, arras, in, 1579, he, secured, the, support, of, the, malcontents, as, the, catholic, nobles, of, the, south, were, styled, the, seven, northern, provinces, as, well, as, the, county, of, flanders, and, duchy, of, brabant, controlled, by, calvinists, responded, with, the, union, of, utrecht, where, they, resolved, to, stick, together, to, fight, spain, farnese, secured, his, base, in, hainaut, and, artois, then, moved, against, brabant, and, flanders, city, after, city, fell, tournai,

of, sieges, rather, than, battles, he, proved, his, mettle, his, strategy, was, to, offer, generous, terms, for, surrender, there, would, be, no, massacres, or, looting, historic, urban, privileges, were, retained, there, was, a, full, pardon, and, amnesty, return, to, the, catholic, church, would, be, gradual, meanwhile, catholic, refugees, from, the, north, regrouped, in, cologne, and, douai, and, developed, a, more, militant, tridentine, identity, they, became, the, mobilizing, forces, of, a, popular, counter, reformation, in, the, south, thereby, facilitating, the, eventual, emergence, of, the, state, of, belgium, the, augsburg, interim, was, a, period, where, counter, reformation, measures, were, exacted, upon, defeated, protestant, populations, following, the, schmalkaldic, war,

of, bavaria, and, successfully, defeated, gebhard, and, his, allies, in, the, habsburg, hereditary, lands, which, had, become, predominantly, protestant, except, for, tyrol, the, counter, reformation, began, with, emperor, rudolf, ii, who, began, suppressing, protestant, activity, in, 1576, this, conflict, escalated, into, the, bohemian, revolt, of, 1620, defeated, the, protestant, nobility, and,

against, the, expulsion, of, protestants, from, moravia, calling, her, choices, unjust, impious, impossible, harmful, and, ridiculous, his, 1781, patent, of, toleration, can, be, regarded, as, the, end, of, the, political, counter, reformation, although, there, were, still, smaller, expulsions, against, protestants, such, as, the, zillertal, expulsion, in, 1966, archbishop, andreas, rohracher, expressed, regret, about, the, expulsions, in, france, from, 1562, catholics, and, huguenots, reformed, protestants, fought, a, series, of, wars, resulting, in, millions, of, deaths, until, the, edict, of, nantes, brought, religious, peace, in, 1598, it, affirmed, catholicism, as, the, state, religion, but, granted, considerable, toleration, to, protestants, as, well, as, political, and, military, privileges, the, latter, would, be, lost, at, the, peace, of, al, s, of, 1629, but, the, religious, toleration, lasted, until, the, reign, of, louis, xiv, who, resumed, persecution, of, protestants, and, finally, abolished, their, right, to, worship, with, the, edict, of, fontainebleau, in, 1685, in, 1565, several, hundred, huguenot, shipwreck, survivors, surrendered, to, the,

full, communion, with, the, catholic, church, while, preserving, their, byzantine, tradition, pope, clement, viii, received, the, ruthenian, bishops, into, full, communion, on, february, 7, 1596, under, the, treaty, of, the, union, of, brest, rome, recognized, the, ruthenians, continued, practice, of, byzantine, liturgical, tradition, married, clergy, and, consecration, of, bishops, from, within, the, ruthenian, christian, tradition, moreover, the, treaty, specifically, exempts, ruthenians, from, accepting, the, filioque, clause, and, purgatory, as, a, condition, for, reconciliation, the, counter, reformation, succeeded, in, drastically, diminishing, protestantism, in, lithuania, poland, france, italy, and, the, vast, lands, controlled, by, the, habsburgs, including, austria, southern, germany, bohemia, now, in, the, czech, republic, the, spanish, netherlands, now, belgium, and, surrounds, croatia, and, slovenia, it, did, not, succeed, as, completely, in, hungary, where, a, sizeable, protestant, minority, remains, to, this, day, although, catholics, still, are, the, largest, christian, denomination, new, religious, orders, were, a, fundamental, part, of, the, reforms,

congregation, of, the, oratory, of, saint, philip, neri, attempted, either, to, be, less, decadent, or, to, engage, in, charitable, service, and, set, examples, of, catholic, renewal, particularly, in, southern, europe, the, jesuits, especially, worked, in, rural, parishes, most, of, these, had, been, founded, earlier, in, the, 15th, century, as, part, of, catholic, reforms, before, the, council, of, trent, the, theatines, undertook, checking, the, spread, of, heresy, and, contributed, to, a, regeneration, of, the, clergy, the, capuchins, an, offshoot, of, the, franciscan, order, notable, for, their, preaching, and, for, their, care, for, the, poor, and, the, sick, grew, rapidly, capuchin, founded, confraternities, took, special, interest, in, the, poor, and, lived, austerely, members, of, orders, active, in, overseas, missionary, expansion, expressed, the, view, that, the, rural, parishes, often, needed, christianizing, as, much, as, the, heathens, of, asia, and, the, americas, the, ursulines, focused, on, the, special, task, of, educating, girls, the, first, order, of, women, to, be, dedicated, to, that, goal, devotion, to, the, traditional, works, of, mercy, exemplified, the, catholic, reformation, s, reaffirmation, of, the, importance, of, both, faith, and, works, and, salvation, through, god, s, grace, and, repudiation, of, the, maxim, sola, fide, emphasized, by, protestants, sects, not, only, did, they, make, the, church, more, effective, but, they, also, reaffirmed, fundamental, premises, of, the, medieval, church, the, jesuits, were, the, most, effective, of, the, new, catholic, orders, an, heir, to, the, devotional, observantine, and, legalist, traditions, the, jesuits, organized, along, military, lines, the, worldliness, of, the, renaissance, church, had, no, part, in, their, new, order, loyola, s, masterwork, spiritual, exercises, showed, the, emphasis, of, handbooks, characteristic, of, catholic, reformers, before, the, reformations, reminiscent, of, devotionalism, jesuits, participated, in, the, expansion, of, the, church, in, the, americas, and, asia, by, their, missionary, activity, loyola, s, biography, contributed, to, an, emphasis, on, popular, piety, that, had, waned, under, political, popes, such, as, alexander, vi, and, leo, x, after, recovering, from, a, serious, wound, he, took, a, vow, to, serve, only, god, and, the, roman, pontiff, his, vicar, on, earth, the, emphasis, on, the, pope, is, a, reaffirmation, of, the, medieval, papalism, while, the, council, of, trent, defeated, conciliarism, the, belief, that, general, councils, of, the, church, collectively, were, god, s, representative, on, earth, rather, than, the, pope, taking, the, pope, as, an, absolute, leader, the, jesuits, contributed, to, the, counter, reformation, church, along, a, line, harmonized, with, rome, the, catholic, reformation, was, not, only, a, political, and, church, policy, oriented, movement, but, it, also, included, major, figures, such, as, catherine, of, genoa, ignatius, of, loyola, teresa, of, vila, john, of, the, cross, francis, de, sales, and, philip, neri, who, added, to, the, spirituality, of, the, catholic, church, teresa, of, avila, and, john, of, the, cross, were, spanish, mystics, and, reformers, of, the, carmelite, order, whose, ministry, focused, on, interior, conversion, to, christ, the, deepening, of, prayer, and, commitment, to, god, s, will, teresa, was, given, the, task, of, developing, and, writing, about, the, way, to, perfection, in, her, love, and, unity, with, christ, thomas, merton, called, john, of, the, cross, the, greatest, of, all, mystical, theologians, the, spirituality, of, filippo, neri, who, lived, in, rome, at, the, same, time, as, ignatius, was, practically, oriented, too, but, totally, opposed, to, the, jesuit, approach, said, filippo, if, i, have, a, real, problem, i, contemplate, what, ignatius, would, do, and, then, i, do, the, exact, opposite, as, a, recognition, of, their, joint, contribution, to, the, spiritual, renewal, within, the, catholic, reformation, ignatius, of, loyola, filippo, neri, and, teresa, of, vila, were, canonized, on, the, same, day, march, 12, 1622, the, virgin, mary, played, an, increasingly, central, role, in, catholic, devotions, the, victory, at, the, battle, of, lepanto, in, 1571, was, accredited, to, the, virgin, mary, and, signified, the, beginning, of, a, strong, resurgence, of, marian, devotions, during, and, after, the, catholic, reformation, marian, piety, experienced, unforeseen, growth, with, over, 500, pages, of, mariological, writings, during, the, 17th, century, alone, the, jesuit, francisco, su, rez, was, the, first, theologian, to, use, the, thomist, method, on, marian, theology, other, well, known, contributors, to, marian, spirituality, are, saints, lawrence, of, brindisi, robert, bellarmine, and, francis, de, sales, the, sacrament, of, penance, was, transformed, from, a, social, to, a, personal, experience, that, is, from, a, public, community, act, to, a, private, confession, it, now, took, place, in, private, in, a, confessional, it, was, a, change, in, its, emphasis, from, reconciliation, with, the, church, to, reconciliation, directly, with, god, and, from, emphasis, on, social, sins, of, hostility, to, private, sins, called, the, secret, sins, of, the, heart, the, catholic, church, was, a, leading, arts, patron, across, much, of, europe, the, goal, of, much, art, in, the, counter, reformation, especially, in, the, rome, of, bernini, and, the, flanders, of, peter, paul, rubens, was, to, restore, catholicism, s, predominance, and, centrality, this, was, one, of, the, drivers, of, the, baroque, style, that, emerged, across, europe, in, the, late, sixteenth, century, in, areas, where, catholicism, predominated, architecture, and, painting, and, to, a, lesser, extent, music, reflected, counter, reformation, goals, the, council, of, trent, proclaimed, that, architecture, painting, and, sculpture, had, a, role, in, conveying, catholic, theology, any, work, that, might, arouse, carnal, desire, was, inadmissible, in, churches, while, any, depiction, of, christ, s, suffering, and, explicit, agony, was, desirable, and, proper, in, an, era, when, some, protestant, reformers, were, destroying, images, of, saints, and, whitewashing, walls, catholic, reformers, reaffirmed, the, importance, of, art, with, special, encouragement, given, to, images, of, the, virgin, mary, the, last, judgment, a, fresco, in, the, sistine, chapel, by, michelangelo, 1534, 1541, came, under, persistent, attack, in, the, counter, reformation, for, among, other, things, nudity, later, painted, over, for, several, centuries, not, showing, christ, seated, or, bearded, and, including, the, pagan, figure, of, charon, italian, painting, after, 1520, with, the, notable, exception, of, the, art, of, venice, developed, into, mannerism, a, highly, sophisticated, style, striving, for, effect, that, concerned, many, churchmen, as, lacking, appeal, for, the, mass, of, the, population, church, pressure, to, restrain, religious, imagery, affected, art, from, the, 1530s, and, resulted, in, the, decrees, of, the, final, session, of, the, council, of, trent, in, 1563, including, short, and, rather, inexplicit, passages, concerning, religious, images, which, were, to, have, great, impact, on, the, development, of, catholic, art, previous, catholic, councils, had, rarely, felt, the, need, to, pronounce, on, these, matters, unlike, orthodox, ones, which, have, often, ruled, on, specific, types, of, images, the, decree, confirmed, the, traditional, doctrine, that, images, only, represented, the, person, depicted, and, that, veneration, to, them, was, paid, to, the, person, not, the, image, and, further, instructed, that, every, superstition, shall, be, removed, all, lasciviousness, be, avoided, in, such, wise, that, figures, shall, not, be, painted, or, adorned, with, a, beauty, exciting, to, lust, there, be, nothing, seen, that, is, disorderly, or, that, is, unbecomingly, or, confusedly, arranged, nothing, that, is, profane, nothing, indecorous, seeing, that, holiness, becometh, the, house, of, god, and, that, these, things, may, be, the, more, faithfully, observed, the, holy, synod, ordains, that, no, one, be, allowed, to, place, or, cause, to, be, placed, any, unusual, image, in, any, place, or, church, howsoever, exempted, except, that, image, have, been, approved, of, by, the, bishop, ten, years, after, the, decree, paolo, veronese, was, summoned, by, the, holy, office, to, explain, why, his, last, supper, a, huge, canvas, for, the, refectory, of, a, monastery, contained, in, the, words, of, the, holy, office, buffoons, drunken, germans, dwarfs, and, other, such, scurrilities, as, well, as, extravagant, costumes, and, settings, in, what, is, indeed, a, fantasy, version, of, a, venetian, patrician, feast, veronese, was, told, that, he, must, change, his, painting, within, a, three, month, period, he, just, changed, the, title, to, the, feast, in, the, house, of, levi, still, an, episode, from, the, gospels, but, a, less, doctrinally, central, one, and, no, more, was, said, the, number, of, such, decorative, treatments, of, religious, subjects, declined, sharply, as, did, unbecomingly, or, confusedly, arranged, mannerist, pieces, as, a, number, of, books, notably, by, the, flemish, theologian, molanus, charles, borromeo, and, cardinal, gabriele, paleotti, and, instructions, by, local, bishops, amplified, the, decrees, often, going, into, minute, detail, on, what, was, acceptable, much, traditional, iconography, considered, without, adequate, scriptural, foundation, was, in, effect, prohibited, as, was, any, inclusion, of, classical, pagan, elements, in, religious, art, and, almost, all, nudity, including, that, of, the, infant, jesus, according, to, the, great, medievalist, mile, m, le, this, was, the, death, of, medieval, art, but, it, paled, in, contrast, to, the, iconclasm, present, in, some, protestant, circles, and, did, not, apply, to, secular, paintings, some, counter, reformation, painters, and, sculptors, include, titian, tintoretto, federico, barocci, scipione, pulzone, el, greco, peter, paul, rubens, guido, reni, anthony, van, dyck, bernini, zurbar, n, rembrandt, and, bartolom, esteban, murillo, the, council, of, trent, is, believed, to, be, the, apex, of, the, counter, reformation, s, influence, on, church, music, in, the, 16th, century, however, the, council, s, pronouncements, on, music, were, not, the, first, attempt, at, reform, the, catholic, church, had, spoken, out, against, a, perceived, abuse, of, music, used, in, the, mass, before, the, council, of, trent, ever, convened, to, discuss, music, in, 1562, the, manipulation, of, the, creed, and, using, non, liturgical, songs, was, addressed, in, 1503, and, secular, singing, and, the, intelligibility, of, the, text, in, the, delivery, of, psalmody, in, 1492, 576, the, delegates, at, the, council, were, just, a, link, in, the, long, chain, of, church, clergy, who, had, pushed, for, a, reform, of, the, musical, liturgy, reaching, back, as, far, as, 1322, probably, the, most, extreme, move, at, reform, came, late, in, 1562, when, instructed, by, the, legates, egidio, foscarari, bishop, of, modena, and, gabriele, paleotti, archbishop, of, bologna, began, work, on, reforming, religious, orders, and, their, practices, involving, the, liturgy, the, reforms, prescribed, to, the, cloisters, of, nuns, which, included, omitting, the, use, of, an, organ, prohibiting, professional, musicians, and, banishing, polyphonic, singing, were, much, more, strict, than, any, of, the, council, s, edicts, or, even, those, to, be, found, in, the, palestrina, legend, fueling, the, cry, for, reform, from, many, ecclesial, figures, was, the, compositional, technique, popular, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, of, using, musical, material, and, even, the, accompanying, texts, from, other, compositions, such, as, motets, madrigals, and, chansons, several, voices, singing, different, texts, in, different, languages, made, any, of, the, text, difficult, to, distinguish, from, the, mixture, of, words, and, notes, the, parody, mass, would, then, contain, melodies, usually, the, tenor, line, and, words, from, songs, that, could, have, been, and, often, were, on, sensual, subjects, the, musical, liturgy, of, the, church, was, being, more, and, more, influenced, by, secular, tunes, and, styles, the, council, of, paris, which, met, in, 1528, as, well, as, the, council, of, trent, were, making, attempts, to, restore, the, sense, of, sacredness, to, the, church, setting, and, what, was, appropriate, for, the, mass, the, councils, were, simply, responding, to, issues, of, their, day, 580, 581, the, council, of, trent, met, sporadically, from, december, 13, 1545, to, december, 4, 1563, to, reform, many, parts, of, the, catholic, church, the, 22nd, session, of, the, council, which, met, in, 1562, dealt, with, church, music, in, canon, 8, in, the, section, of, abuses, in, the, sacrifice, of, the, mass, during, a, meeting, of, the, council, on, september, 10, 1562, 576, canon, 8, states, that, since, the, sacred, mysteries, should, be, celebrated, with, utmost, reverence, with, both, deepest, feeling, toward, god, alone, and, with, external, worship, that, is, truly, suitable, and, becoming, so, that, others, may, be, filled, with, devotion, and, called, to, religion, everything, should, be, regulated, so, that, the, masses, whether, they, be, celebrated, with, the, plain, voice, or, in, song, with, everything, clearly, and, quickly, executed, may, reach, the, ears, of, the, hearers, and, quietly, penetrate, their, hearts, in, those, masses, where, measured, music, and, organ, are, customary, nothing, profane, should, be, intermingled, but, only, hymns, and, divine, praises, if, something, from, the, divine, service, is, sung, with, the, organ, while, the, service, proceeds, let, if, first, be, recited, in, a, simple, clear, voice, lest, the, reading, of, the, sacred, words, be, imperceptible, but, the, entire, manner, of, singing, in, musical, modes, should, be, calculated, not, to, afford, vain, delight, to, the, ear, but, so, that, the, words, may, be, comprehensible, to, all, and, thus, may, the, hearts, of, the, listeners, be, caught, up, into, the, desire, for, celestial, harmonies, and, contemplation, of, the, joys, of, the, blessed, canon, 8, is, often, quoted, as, the, council, of, trent, s, decree, on, church, music, but, that, is, a, glaring, misunderstanding, of, the, canon, it, was, only, a, proposed, decree, in, fact, the, delegates, at, the, council, never, officially, accepted, canon, 8, in, its, popular, form, but, bishops, of, granada, coimbra, and, segovia, pushed, for, the, long, statement, about, music, to, be, attenuated, and, many, other, prelates, of, the, council, joined, enthusiastically, the, only, restrictions, actually, given, by, the, 22nd, session, was, to, keep, secular, elements, out, of, the, music, making, polyphony, implicitly, allowed, the, issue, of, textual, intelligibility, did, not, make, its, way, into, the, final, edicts, of, the, 22nd, session, but, were, only, featured, in, preliminary, debates, the, 22nd, session, only, prohibited, lascivious, and, profane, things, to, be, intermingled, with, the, music, but, paleotti, in, his, acts, brings, to, equal, importance, the, issues, of, intelligibility, the, idea, that, the, council, called, to, remove, all, polyphony, from, the, church, is, widespread, but, there, is, no, documentary, evidence, to, support, that, claim, it, is, possible, however, that, some, of, the, fathers, had, proposed, such, a, measure, the, emperor, ferdinand, i, holy, roman, emperor, has, been, attributed, to, be, the, saviour, of, church, music, because, he, said, polyphony, ought, not, to, be, driven, out, of, the, church, but, ferdinand, was, most, likely, an, alarmist, and, read, into, the, council, the, possibility, of, a, total, ban, on, polyphony, the, council, of, trent, did, not, focus, on, the, style, of, music, but, on, attitudes, of, worship, and, reverence, during, the, mass, 576, the, crises, regarding, polyphony, and, intelligibility, of, the, text, and, the, threat, that, polyphony, was, to, be, removed, completely, which, was, assumed, to, be, coming, from, the, council, has, a, very, dramatic, legend, of, resolution, the, legend, goes, that, giovanni, pierluigi, da, palestrina, c, 1525, 26, 1594, a, church, musician, and, choirmaster, in, rome, wrote, a, mass, for, the, council, delegates, in, order, to, demonstrate, that, a, polyphonic, composition, could, set, the, text, in, such, a, way, that, the, words, could, be, clearly, understood, and, that, was, still, pleasing, to, the, ear, palestrina, s, missa, papae, marcelli, mass, for, pope, marcellus, was, performed, before, the, council, and, received, such, a, welcoming, reception, among, the, delegates, that, they, completely, changed, their, minds, and, allowed, polyphony, to, stay, in, use, in, the, musical, liturgy, therefore, palestrina, came, to, be, named, the, saviour, of, church, polyphony, this, legend, though, unfounded, has, long, been, a, mainstay, of, histories, of, music, the, saviour, myth, was, first, spread, by, an, account, by, aggazzari, and, banchieri, in, 1609, who, said, that, pope, marcellus, was, trying, to, replace, all, polyphony, with, plainsong, palestrina, s, missa, papae, marcelli, was, though, in, 1564, after, the, 22nd, session, performed, for, the, pope, while, reforms, were, being, considered, for, the, sistine, choir, the, pope, marcellus, mass, in, short, was, not, important, in, its, own, day, and, did, not, help, save, church, polyphony, what, is, undeniable, is, that, despite, any, solid, evidence, of, his, influence, during, or, after, the, council, of, trent, no, figure, is, more, qualified, to, represent, the, cause, of, polyphony, in, the, mass, than, palestrina, pope, pius, iv, upon, hearing, palestrina, s, music, would, make, palestrina, by, papal, brief, the, model, for, future, generations, of, catholic, composers, of, sacred, music, like, his, contemporary, palestrina, the, flemish, composer, jacobus, de, kerle, 1531, 32, 1591, was, also, credited, with, giving, a, model, of, composition, for, the, council, of, trent, his, composition, in, four, parts, preces, marks, the, official, turning, point, of, the, counter, reformation, s, a, cappella, ideal, kerle, was, the, only, ranking, composer, of, the, netherlands, to, have, acted, in, conformity, with, the, council, another, musical, giant, on, equal, standing, with, palestrina, orlando, di, lasso, 1530, 32, 1594, was, an, important, figure, in, music, history, though, less, of, a, purist, than, palestrina, he, expressed, sympathy, for, the, council, s, concerns, but, still, showed, favor, for, the, parady, chanson, masses, despite, the, dearth, of, edicts, from, the, council, regarding, polyphony, and, textual, clarity, the, reforms, that, followed, from, the, 22nd, session, filled, in, the, gaps, left, by, the, council, in, stylistic, areas, in, the, 24th, session, the, council, gave, authority, to, provincial, synods, to, discern, provisions, for, church, music, 576, 577, the, decision, to, leave, practical, application, and, stylistic, matters, to, local, ecclesiastical, leaders, was, important, in, shaping, the, future, of, catholic, church, music, it, was, left, then, up, to, the, local, church, leaders, and, church, musicians, to, find, proper, application, for, the, council, s, decrees, though, originally, theological, and, directed, towards, the, attitudes, of, the, musicians, the, council, s, decrees, came, to, be, thought, of, by, church, musicians, as, a, pronouncement, on, proper, musical, styles, 592, 593, this, understanding, was, most, likely, spread, through, musicians, who, sought, to, implement, the, council, s, declarations, but, did, not, read, the, official, tridentine, pronouncements, church, musicians, were, probably, influenced, by, order, from, their, ecclesiastical, patrons, composers, who, reference, the, council, s, reforms, in, prefaces, to, their, compositions, do, not, adequately, claim, a, musical, basis, from, the, council, but, a, spiritual, and, religious, basis, of, their, art, 576, 594, the, cardinal, archbishop, of, milan, charles, borromeo, was, a, very, important, figure, in, reforming, church, music, after, the, council, of, trent, though, borromeo, was, an, aide, to, the, pope, in, rome, and, was, unable, to, be, in, milan, he, eagerly, pushed, for, the, decrees, of, the, council, to, be, quickly, put, into, practice, in, milan, borromeo, kept, in, contact, with, his, church, in, milian, through, letters, and, eagerly, encouraged, the, leaders, there, to, implement, the, reforms, coming, from, the, council, of, trent, in, one, of, his, letters, to, his, vicar, in, the, milan, diocese, nicolo, ormaneto, of, verona, borromeo, commissioned, the, master, of, the, chapel, vincenzo, ruffo, 1508, 1587, to, write, a, mass, that, would, make, the, words, as, easy, to, understand, as, possible, borromeo, also, suggested, that, if, don, nicola, a, composer, of, a, more, chromatic, style, was, in, milan, he, too, could, compose, a, mass, and, the, two, be, compared, for, textural, clarity, borromeo, was, likely, involved, or, heard, of, the, questions, regarding, textual, clarity, because, of, his, request, to, ruffo, ruffo, took, borromeo, s, commission, seriously, and, set, out, to, compose, in, a, style, that, presented, the, text, so, that, all, words, would, be, intelligible, and, the, textual, meaning, be, the, most, important, part, of, the, composition, his, approach, was, to, move, all, the, voices, in, a, homorhythmic, manner, with, no, complicated, rhythms, and, to, use, dissonance, very, conservatively, ruffo, s, approach, was, certainly, a, success, for, textual, clarity, and, simplicity, but, if, his, music, was, very, theoretically, pure, it, was, not, an, artistic, success, despite, ruffo, s, attempts, to, bring, interest, to, the, monotonous, four, part, texture, ruffo, s, compositional, style, which, favored, the, text, was, well, in, line, with, the, council, s, perceived, concern, with, intelligibility, thus, the, belief, in, the, council, s, strong, edicts, regarding, textual, intelligibility, became, to, characterize, the, development, of, sacred, church, music, the, council, of, trent, brought, about, other, changes, in, music, most, notably, developing, the, missa, brevis, lauda, and, spiritual, madrigal, madrigali, spirituali, additionally, the, numerous, sequences, were, mostly, prohibited, in, the, 1570, missal, of, pius, v, the, remaining, sequences, were, victimae, paschali, laudes, for, easter, veni, sancte, spiritus, for, pentecost, lauda, sion, salvatorem, for, corpus, christi, and, dies, irae, for, all, souls, and, for, masses, for, the, dead, another, reform, following, the, council, of, trent, was, the, publication, of, the, 1568, roman, breviary, more, celebrations, of, holidays, and, similar, events, raised, a, need, to, have, these, events, followed, closely, throughout, the, dioceses, but, there, was, a, problem, with, the, accuracy, of, the, calendar, by, the, sixteenth, century, the, julian, calendar, was, almost, ten, days, out, of, step, with, the, seasons, and, the, heavenly, bodies, among, the, astronomers, who, were, asked, to, work, on, the, problem, of, how, the, calendar, could, be, reformed, was, nicolaus, copernicus, a, canon, at, frombork, frauenburg, in,
