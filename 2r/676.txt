in, archaeology, excavation, is, the, exposure, processing, and, recording, of, archaeological, remains, an, excavation, site, or, dig, is, the, area, being, studied, these, locations, range, from, one, to, several, areas, at, a, time, during, a, project, and, can, be, conducted, over, a, few, weeks, to, several, years, excavation, involves, the, recovery, of, several, types, of, data, from, a, site, this, data, includes, artifacts, portable, objects, made, or, modified, by, humans, features, non, portable, modifications, to, the, site, itself, such, as, post, molds, burials, and, hearths, ecofacts, evidence, of, human, activity, through, organic, remains, such, as, animal, bones, pollen, or, charcoal, and, archaeological, context, relationships, among, the, other, types, of, data, before, excavating, the, presence, or, absence, of, archaeological, remains, can, often, be, suggested, by, non, intrusive, remote, sensing, such, as, ground, penetrating, radar, basic, information, about, the, development, of, the, site, may, be, drawn, from, this, work, but, to, understand, finer, details, of, a, site, excavation, via, augering, can, be, used, during, excavation, archaeologists, often, use, stratigraphic, excavation, to, remove, phases, of, the, site, one, layer, at, a, time, this, keeps, the, timeline, of, the, material, remains, consistent, with, one, another, this, is, done, usually, though, mechanical, means, where, artifacts, can, be, spot, dated, and, the, soil, processed, through, methods, such, as, mechanical, sieving, or, water, flotation, afterwards, digital, methods, are, then, used, record, the, excavation, process, and, its, results, ideally, data, from, the, excavation, should, suffice, to, reconstruct, the, site, completely, in, three, dimensional, space, the, first, instance, of, archaeological, excavation, took, place, in, the, sixth, century, bc, when, nabonidus, the, king, of, babylon, excavated, a, temple, floor, that, was, thousands, of, years, old, during, early, roman, periods, julius, caesar, s, men, looted, bronze, artifacts, and, by, the, medieval, period, europeans, had, begun, digging, up, pots, that, had, partially, emerged, from, erosion, and, weapons, that, had, turned, up, on, farmlands, antiquarians, excavated, burial, mounds, in, north, america, and, north, west, europe, which, sometimes, involved, destroying, artifacts, and, their, context, losing, information, about, subjects, from, the, past, meticulous, and, methodical, archaeological, excavation, took, over, from, antiquarian, barrow, digging, around, the, early, to, mid, nineteenth, century, and, is, still, being, perfected, today, the, most, dramatic, change, that, occurred, over, time, is, the, amount, of, recording, and, care, taken, to, ensure, preservation, of, artifacts, and, features, in, the, past, archaeological, excavation, involved, random, digging, to, unearth, artifacts, exact, locations, of, artifacts, were, not, recorded, and, measurements, were, not, taken, modern, archaeological, excavation, has, evolved, to, include, removal, of, thin, layers, of, sediment, sequentially, and, recording, of, measurements, about, artifacts, locations, in, a, site, there, are, two, basic, types, of, modern, archaeological, excavation, there, are, two, main, types, of, trial, excavation, in, professional, archaeology, both, commonly, associated, with, development, led, excavation, the, test, pit, or, trench, and, the, watching, brief, the, purpose, of, trial, excavations, is, to, determine, the, extent, and, characteristics, of, archaeological, potential, in, a, given, area, before, extensive, excavation, work, is, undertaken, this, is, usually, conducted, in, development, led, excavations, as, part, of, project, management, planning, the, main, difference, between, trial, trenching, and, watching, briefs, is, that, trial, trenches, are, actively, dug, for, the, purpose, of, revealing, archaeological, potential, whereas, watching, briefs, are, cursory, examination, of, trenches, where, the, primary, function, of, the, trench, is, something, other, than, archaeology, for, example, a, trench, cut, for, a, gas, pipe, in, a, road, in, the, us, a, method, of, evaluation, called, a, shovel, test, pit, is, used, which, is, a, specified, half, meter, square, line, of, trial, trenches, dug, by, hand, archaeological, material, tends, to, accumulate, in, events, a, gardener, swept, a, pile, of, soil, into, a, corner, laid, a, gravel, path, or, planted, a, bush, in, a, hole, a, builder, built, a, wall, and, back, filled, the, trench, years, later, someone, built, a, pigsty, onto, it, and, drained, the, pigsty, into, the, nettle, patch, later, still, the, original, wall, blew, over, and, so, on, each, event, which, may, have, taken, a, short, or, long, time, to, accomplish, leaves, a, context, this, layer, cake, of, events, is, often, referred, to, as, the, archaeological, sequence, or, record, it, is, by, analysis, of, this, sequence, or, record, that, excavation, is, intended, to, permit, interpretation, which, should, lead, to, discussion, and, understanding, the, prominent, processual, archaeologist, lewis, binford, highlighted, the, fact, that, the, archaeological, evidence, left, at, a, site, may, not, be, entirely, indicative, of, the, historical, events, that, actually, took, place, there, using, an, ethnoarchaeological, comparison, he, looked, at, how, hunters, amongst, the, nunamiut, i, upiat, of, north, central, alaska, spent, a, great, deal, of, time, in, a, certain, area, simply, waiting, for, prey, to, arrive, there, and, that, during, this, period, they, undertook, other, tasks, to, pass, the, time, such, as, the, carving, of, various, objects, including, a, wooden, mould, for, a, mask, a, horn, spoon, and, an, ivory, needle, as, well, as, repairing, a, skin, pouch, and, a, pair, of, caribou, skin, socks, binford, notes, that, all, of, these, activities, would, have, left, evidence, in, the, archaeological, record, but, that, none, of, them, would, provide, evidence, for, the, primary, reason, that, the, hunters, were, in, the, area, to, wait, for, prey, as, he, remarked, waiting, for, animals, to, hunt, represented, 24, of, the, total, man, hours, of, activity, recorded, yet, there, is, no, recognisable, archaeological, consequences, of, this, behaviour, no, tools, left, on, the, site, were, used, and, there, were, no, immediate, material, byproducts, of, the, primary, activity, all, of, the, other, activities, conducted, at, the, site, were, essentially, boredom, reducers, in, archaeology, especially, in, excavating, stratigraphy, involves, the, study, of, how, deposits, occurs, layer, by, layer, it, is, largely, based, on, the, law, of, superposition, the, law, of, superposition, indicates, that, layers, of, sediment, further, down, will, contain, older, artifacts, than, layers, above, when, archaeological, finds, are, below, the, surface, of, the, ground, as, is, most, commonly, the, case, the, identification, of, the, context, of, each, find, is, vital, to, enable, the, archaeologist, to, draw, conclusions, about, the, site, and, the, nature, and, date, of, its, occupation, it, is, the, archaeologist, s, role, to, attempt, to, discover, what, contexts, exist, and, how, they, came, to, be, created, archaeological, stratification, or, sequence, is, the, dynamic, superimposition, of, single, units, of, stratigraphy, or, contexts, the, context, physical, location, of, a, discovery, can, be, of, major, significance, archaeological, context, refers, to, where, an, artifact, or, feature, was, found, as, well, as, what, the, artifact, or, feature, was, located, near, context, is, important, for, determining, how, long, ago, the, artifact, or, feature, was, in, use, as, well, as, what, its, function, may, have, been, the, cutting, of, a, pit, or, ditch, in, the, past, is, a, context, whilst, the, material, filling, it, will, be, another, multiple, fills, seen, in, section, would, mean, multiple, contexts, structural, features, natural, deposits, and, inhumations, are, also, contexts, by, separating, a, site, into, these, basic, discrete, units, archaeologists, are, able, to, create, a, chronology, for, activity, on, a, site, and, describe, and, interpret, it, stratigraphic, relationships, are, the, relationships, created, between, contexts, in, time, representing, the, chronological, order, they, were, created, an, example, would, be, a, ditch, and, the, back, fill, of, said, ditch, the, relationship, of, the, fill, context, to, the, ditch, cut, context, is, the, fill, occurred, later, in, the, sequence, i, e, you, have, to, dig, a, ditch, first, before, you, can, back, fill, it, a, relationship, that, is, later, in, the, sequence, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, higher, in, the, sequence, and, a, relationship, that, is, earlier, lower, though, the, term, higher, or, lower, does, not, itself, imply, a, context, needs, to, be, physically, higher, or, lower, it, is, more, useful, to, think, of, this, higher, or, lower, term, as, it, relates, to, the, contexts, position, in, a, harris, matrix, which, is, a, two, dimensional, representation, of, a, site, s, formation, in, space, and, time, understanding, a, site, in, modern, archaeology, is, a, process, of, grouping, single, contexts, together, in, ever, larger, groups, by, virtue, of, their, relationships, the, terminology, of, these, larger, clusters, varies, depending, on, practitioner, but, the, terms, interface, sub, group, group, and, land, use, are, common, an, example, of, a, sub, group, could, be, the, three, contexts, that, make, up, a, burial, the, grave, cut, the, body, and, the, back, filled, earth, on, top, of, the, body, in, turn, sub, groups, can, be, clustered, together, with, other, sub, groups, by, virtue, of, their, stratigraphic, relationship, to, form, groups, which, in, turn, form, phases, a, sub, group, burial, could, cluster, with, other, sub, group, burials, to, form, a, cemetery, or, burial, group, which, in, turn, could, be, clustered, with, a, building, such, as, church, to, produce, a, phase, a, less, rigorously, defined, combination, of, one, or, more, contexts, is, sometimes, called, a, feature, phase, is, the, most, easily, understood, grouping, for, the, layman, as, it, implies, a, near, contemporaneous, archaeological, horizon, representing, what, you, would, see, if, you, went, back, to, a, specific, point, in, time, often, but, not, always, a, phase, implies, the, identification, of, an, occupation, surface, old, ground, level, that, existed, at, some, earlier, time, the, production, of, phase, interpretations, is, one, of, the, first, goals, of, stratigraphic, interpretation, and, excavation, digging, in, phase, is, not, quite, the, same, as, phasing, a, site, phasing, a, site, represents, reducing, the, site, either, in, excavation, or, post, excavation, to, contemporaneous, horizons, whereas, digging, in, phase, is, the, process, of, stratigraphic, removal, of, archaeological, remains, so, as, not, to, remove, contexts, that, are, earlier, in, time, lower, in, the, sequence, before, other, contexts, that, have, a, latter, physical, stratigraphic, relationship, to, them, as, defined, by, the, law, of, superposition, the, process, of, interpretation, in, practice, will, have, a, bearing, on, excavation, strategies, on, site, so, phasing, a, site, is, actively, pursued, during, excavation, where, at, all, possible, and, is, considered, good, practice, an, intrusion, or, intrusive, object, is, something, that, arrived, later, to, the, phase, in, the, strata, for, example, modern, pipework, or, the, 16th, century, bottles, left, by, treasure, hunters, at, sutton, hoo, excavation, initially, involves, the, removal, of, any, topsoil, a, strategy, for, sampling, the, contexts, and, features, is, formulated, which, may, involve, total, excavation, of, each, feature, or, only, portions, in, stratigraphic, excavation, the, goal, is, to, remove, some, or, preferably, all, archaeological, deposits, and, features, in, the, reverse, order, they, were, created, and, construct, a, harris, matrix, as, a, chronological, record, or, sequence, of, the, site, this, harris, matrix, is, used, for, interpretation, and, combining, contexts, into, ever, larger, units, of, understanding, this, stratigraphic, removal, of, the, site, is, crucial, for, understanding, the, chronology, of, events, on, site, stratigraphic, excavation, involves, a, process, of, cleaning, or, troweling, back, the, surface, of, the, site, and, isolating, contexts, and, edges, which, are, definable, as, either, following, this, preliminary, process, of, defining, the, context, it, is, then, recorded, and, removed, often, owing, to, practical, considerations, or, error, the, process, of, defining, the, edges, of, contexts, is, not, followed, and, contexts, are, removed, out, of, sequence, and, un, stratigraphically, this, is, called, digging, out, of, phase, it, is, not, good, practice, after, removing, a, context, or, if, practical, a, set, of, contexts, such, as, the, case, would, be, for, features, the, isolate, and, dig, procedure, is, repeated, until, no, man, made, remains, are, left, on, site, and, the, site, is, reduced, to, natural, this, describes, the, use, in, excavations, of, various, types, and, sizes, of, machines, from, small, backhoes, to, heavy, duty, earth, moving, machinery, machines, are, often, used, in, what, is, called, salvage, or, rescue, archaeology, in, developer, led, excavation, when, there, are, financial, or, time, pressures, using, a, mechanical, excavator, is, the, quickest, method, to, remove, soil, and, debris, and, to, prepare, the, surface, for, excavation, by, hand, taking, care, to, avoid, damaging, archaeological, deposits, by, accident, or, to, make, it, difficult, to, identify, later, precisely, where, finds, were, located, the, use, of, such, machinery, is, often, routine, as, it, is, for, instance, with, the, british, archaeological, television, series, time, team, but, can, also, be, controversial, as, it, can, result, in, less, discrimination, in, how, the, archaeological, sequence, on, a, site, is, recorded, one, of, the, earliest, uses, of, earth, moving, machinery, was, at, durrington, walls, in, 1967, an, old, road, through, the, henge, was, to, be, straightened, and, improved, and, was, going, to, cause, considerable, damage, to, the, archaeology, rosemary, hill, describes, how, geoffrey, wainwright, oversaw, large, high, speed, excavations, taking, bulldozers, to, the, site, in, a, manner, that, shocked, some, of, his, colleagues, but, yielded, valuable, if, tantalising, information, about, what, durrington, had, looked, like, and, how, it, might, have, been, used, machines, are, used, primarily, to, remove, modern, overburden, and, for, the, control, of, spoil, in, british, archaeology, mechanical, diggers, are, sometimes, nicknamed, big, yellow, trowels, archaeological, excavation, is, an, unrepeatable, process, since, the, same, area, of, the, ground, cannot, be, excavated, twice, thus, archaeology, is, often, known, as, a, destructive, science, where, you, must, destroy, the, original, evidence, in, order, to, make, observations, to, mitigate, this, highly, accurate, and, precise, digital, methods, can, be, used, to, record, the, excavation, process, and, its, results, single, context, recording, was, developed, in, the, 1970s, by, the, museum, of, london, as, well, as, earlier, in, winchester, and, york, and, has, become, the, de, facto, recording, system, in, many, parts, of, the, world, and, is, especially, suited, to, the, complexities, of, deep, urban, archaeology, and, the, process, of, stratification, each, excavated, context, is, given, a, unique, context, number, and, is, recorded, by, type, on, a, context, sheet, and, perhaps, being, drawn, on, a, plan, and, or, a, section, depending, on, time, constraints, and, importance, contexts, may, also, be, photographed, but, in, this, case, a, grouping, of, contexts, and, their, associations, are, the, purpose, of, the, photography, finds, from, each, context, are, bagged, and, labeled, with, their, context, number, and, site, code, for, later, cross, reference, work, carried, out, post, excavation, the, height, above, sea, level, of, pertinent, points, on, a, context, such, as, the, top, and, bottom, of, a, wall, are, taken, and, added, to, plans, sections, and, context, sheets, heights, are, recorded, with, a, dumpy, level, or, total, station, by, relation, to, the, site, temporary, benchmark, abbr, t, b, m, samples, of, deposits, from, contexts, are, sometimes, also, taken, for, later, environmental, analysis, or, for, scientific, dating, digital, tools, used, by, field, archaeologists, during, excavation, include, gps, tablet, computers, relational, databases, digital, cameras, 3d, laser, scanners, and, unmanned, aerial, vehicles, after, high, quality, digital, data, have, been, recorded, these, data, can, then, be, shared, over, the, internet, for, open, access, and, use, by, the, public, and, archaeological, researchers, digital, imaging, or, digital, image, acquisition, is, digital, photography, such, as, of, a, physical, scene, or, of, the, interior, structure, of, an, object, the, term, is, often, used, to, include, the, processing, compression, storage, printing, and, display, of, the, images, finds, and, artifacts, that, survive, in, the, archaeological, record, are, retrieved, in, the, main, by, hand, and, observation, as, the, context, they, survive, in, is, excavated, several, other, techniques, are, available, depending, on, suitability, and, time, constraints, sieving, screening, and, flotation, are, used, to, maximize, the, recovery, of, small, items, such, as, small, shards, of, pottery, or, flint, flakes, or, bones, and, seeds, flotation, is, a, process, of, retrieval, that, works, by, passing, spoil, onto, the, surface, of, water, and, separating, finds, that, float, from, the, spoil, which, sinks, this, is, especially, suited, to, the, recovery, of, environmental, data, stored, in, organic, material, such, as, seeds, and, small, bones, not, all, finds, retrieval, is, done, during, excavation, and, some, especially, flotation, may, take, place, post, excavation, from, samples, taken, during, excavation, the, use, of, sieving, screening, is, more, common, on, research, based, excavations, where, more, time, is, available, some, success, has, been, achieved, with, the, use, of, cement, mixers, and, bulk, sieving, this, method, allows, the, quick, removal, of, context, by, shovel, and, mattock, yet, allows, for, a, high, retrieval, rate, spoil, is, shoveled, into, cement, mixers, and, water, added, to, form, a, slurry, which, is, then, poured, through, a, large, screen, mesh, the, speed, of, this, technique, is, offset, by, the, damage, it, does, to, more, fragile, artifacts, one, important, role, of, finds, retrieval, during, excavation, is, the, role, of, specialists, to, provide, spot, dating, information, on, the, contexts, being, removed, from, the, archaeological, record, this, can, provide, advance, warning, of, potential, discoveries, to, come, by, virtue, of, residual, finds, redeposited, in, contexts, higher, in, the, sequence, which, should, be, coming, offsite, earlier, than, contexts, from, early, eras, and, phases, spot, dating, also, forms, part, of, a, confirmation, process, of, assessing, the, validity, of, the, working, hypothesis, on, the, phasing, of, site, during, excavation, for, example, the, presence, of, an, anomalous, medieval, pottery, sherd, in, what, was, thought, to, be, an, iron, age, ditch, feature, could, radically, alter, onsite, thinking, on, the, correct, strategy, for, digging, a, site, and, save, a, lot, of, information, being, lost, due, to, incorrect, assumptions, about, the, nature, of, the, deposits, which, will, be, destroyed, by, the, excavation, process, and, in, turn, limit, the, site, s, potential, for, revealing, information, for, post, excavation, specialists, or, anomalous, information, could, show, up, errors, in, excavation, such, as, undercutting, dating, methodology, in, part, relies, on, accurate, excavation, and, in, this, sense, the, two, activities, become, interdependent
