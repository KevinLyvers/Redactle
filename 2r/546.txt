the, revolutions, of, 1848, known, in, some, countries, as, the, springtime, of, the, peoples, or, the, springtime, of, nations, were, a, series, of, revolutions, throughout, europe, over, the, course, of, more, than, one, year, from, 1848, to, 1849, it, remains, the, most, widespread, revolutionary, wave, in, european, history, to, date, the, revolutions, were, essentially, democratic, and, liberal, in, nature, with, the, aim, of, removing, the, old, monarchical, structures, and, creating, independent, nation, states, as, envisioned, by, romantic, nationalism, the, revolutions, spread, across, europe, after, an, initial, revolution, began, in, italy, in, january, 1848, over, 50, countries, were, affected, but, with, no, significant, coordination, or, cooperation, among, their, respective, revolutionaries, some, of, the, major, contributing, factors, were, widespread, dissatisfaction, with, political, leadership, demands, for, more, participation, in, government, and, democracy, demands, for, freedom, of, the, press, other, demands, made, by, the, working, class, for, economic, rights, the, upsurge, of, nationalism, and, the, european, potato, failure, which, triggered, mass, starvation, migration, and, civil, unrest, the, uprisings, were, led, by, temporary, coalitions, of, reformers, the, middle, classes, the, upper, classes, the, bourgeoisie, and, workers, however, the, coalitions, did, not, hold, together, for, long, many, of, the, revolutions, were, quickly, suppressed, as, tens, of, thousands, of, people, were, killed, and, even, more, were, forced, into, exile, significant, lasting, reforms, included, the, abolition, of, serfdom, in, austria, and, hungary, the, end, of, absolute, monarchy, in, denmark, and, the, introduction, of, representative, democracy, in, the, netherlands, the, revolutions, were, most, important, in, france, the, netherlands, italy, the, austrian, empire, and, the, states, of, the, german, confederation, that, would, make, up, the, german, empire, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, wave, of, uprisings, ended, in, october, 1849, the, revolutions, arose, from, such, a, wide, variety, of, causes, that, it, is, difficult, to, view, them, as, resulting, from, a, coherent, movement, or, set, of, social, phenomena, numerous, changes, had, been, taking, place, in, european, society, throughout, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, both, liberal, reformers, and, radical, politicians, were, reshaping, national, governments, technological, change, was, revolutionizing, the, life, of, the, working, classes, a, popular, press, extended, political, awareness, and, new, values, and, ideas, such, as, popular, liberalism, nationalism, and, socialism, began, to, emerge, some, historians, emphasize, the, serious, crop, failures, particularly, those, of, 1846, that, produced, hardship, among, peasants, and, the, working, urban, poor, large, swaths, of, the, nobility, were, discontented, with, royal, absolutism, or, near, absolutism, in, 1846, there, had, been, an, uprising, of, polish, nobility, in, austrian, galicia, which, was, only, countered, when, peasants, in, turn, rose, up, against, the, nobles, additionally, an, uprising, by, democratic, forces, against, prussia, planned, but, not, actually, carried, out, occurred, in, greater, poland, the, middle, and, working, classes, thus, shared, a, desire, for, reform, and, agreed, on, many, of, the, specific, aims, their, participation, in, the, revolutions, however, differed, while, much, of, the, impetus, came, from, the, middle, classes, the, physical, backbone, of, the, movement, came, from, the, lower, classes, the, revolts, first, erupted, in, the, cities, the, population, in, french, rural, areas, had, risen, rapidly, causing, many, peasants, to, seek, a, living, in, the, cities, many, in, the, bourgeoisie, feared, and, distanced, themselves, from, the, working, poor, many, unskilled, laborers, toiled, from, 12, to, 15, hours, per, day, when, they, had, work, living, in, squalid, disease, ridden, slums, traditional, artisans, felt, the, pressure, of, industrialization, having, lost, their, guilds, the, liberalization, of, trade, laws, and, the, growth, of, factories, had, increased, the, gulf, between, master, tradesmen, and, journeymen, and, apprentices, whose, numbers, increased, disproportionately, by, 93, from, 1815, to, 1848, in, germany, significant, proletarian, unrest, had, occurred, in, lyon, in, 1831, and, 1834, and, prague, in, 1844, jonathan, sperber, has, suggested, that, in, the, period, after, 1825, poorer, urban, workers, particularly, day, laborers, factory, workers, and, artisans, saw, their, purchasing, power, decline, relatively, steeply, urban, meat, consumption, in, belgium, france, and, germany, stagnated, or, declined, after, 1830, despite, growing, populations, the, economic, panic, of, 1847, increased, urban, unemployment, 10, 000, viennese, factory, workers, lost, jobs, and, 128, hamburg, firms, went, bankrupt, over, the, course, of, 1847, with, the, exception, of, the, netherlands, there, was, a, strong, correlation, among, the, countries, that, were, most, deeply, affected, by, the, industrial, shock, of, 1847, and, those, that, underwent, a, revolution, in, 1848, the, situation, in, the, german, states, was, similar, parts, of, prussia, were, beginning, to, industrialize, during, the, decade, of, the, 1840s, mechanized, production, in, the, textile, industry, brought, about, inexpensive, clothing, that, undercut, the, handmade, products, of, german, tailors, reforms, ameliorated, the, most, unpopular, features, of, rural, feudalism, but, industrial, workers, remained, dissatisfied, with, these, reforms, and, pressed, for, greater, change, urban, workers, had, no, choice, but, to, spend, half, of, their, income, on, food, which, consisted, mostly, of, bread, and, potatoes, as, a, result, of, harvest, failures, food, prices, soared, and, the, demand, for, manufactured, goods, decreased, causing, an, increase, in, unemployment, during, the, revolution, to, address, the, problem, of, unemployment, workshops, were, organized, for, men, interested, in, construction, work, officials, also, set, up, workshops, for, women, when, they, felt, they, were, excluded, artisans, and, unemployed, workers, destroyed, industrial, machines, when, they, threatened, to, give, employers, more, power, over, them, rural, population, growth, had, led, to, food, shortages, land, pressure, and, migration, both, within, and, from, europe, especially, to, the, americas, peasant, discontent, in, the, 1840s, grew, in, intensity, peasant, occupations, of, lost, communal, land, increased, in, many, areas, those, convicted, of, wood, theft, in, the, rhenish, palatinate, increased, from, 100, 000, in, 1829, 30, to, 185, 000, in, 1846, 47, in, the, years, 1845, and, 1846, a, potato, blight, caused, a, subsistence, crisis, in, northern, europe, and, encouraged, the, raiding, of, manorial, potato, stocks, in, silesia, in, 1847, the, effects, of, the, blight, were, most, severely, manifested, in, the, great, irish, famine, but, also, caused, famine, like, conditions, in, the, scottish, highlands, and, throughout, continental, europe, harvests, of, rye, in, the, rhineland, were, 20, of, previous, levels, while, the, czech, potato, harvest, was, reduced, by, half, these, reduced, harvests, were, accompanied, by, a, steep, rise, in, prices, the, cost, of, wheat, more, than, doubled, in, france, and, habsburg, italy, there, were, 400, french, food, riots, from, 1846, to, 1847, while, german, socio, economic, protests, increased, from, 28, from, 1830, to, 1839, to, 103, from, 1840, to, 1847, central, to, long, term, peasant, grievances, were, the, loss, of, communal, lands, forest, restrictions, such, as, the, french, forest, code, of, 1827, and, remaining, feudal, structures, notably, the, robot, labor, obligations, that, existed, among, the, serfs, and, oppressed, peasantry, of, the, habsburg, lands, aristocratic, wealth, and, corresponding, power, was, synonymous, with, the, ownership, of, farmlands, and, effective, control, over, the, peasants, peasant, grievances, exploded, during, the, revolutionary, year, of, 1848, yet, were, often, disconnected, from, urban, revolutionary, movements, the, revolutionary, s, ndor, pet, fi, s, popular, nationalist, rhetoric, in, budapest, did, not, translate, into, any, success, with, the, magyar, peasantry, while, the, viennese, democrat, hans, kudlich, reported, that, his, efforts, to, galvanize, the, austrian, peasantry, had, disappeared, in, the, great, sea, of, indifference, and, phlegm, despite, forceful, and, often, violent, efforts, of, established, and, reactionary, powers, to, keep, them, down, disruptive, ideas, gained, popularity, democracy, liberalism, radicalism, nationalism, and, socialism, they, demanded, a, constitution, universal, manhood, suffrage, press, freedom, freedom, of, expression, and, other, democratic, rights, the, establishment, of, civilian, militia, liberation, of, peasants, liberalization, of, the, economy, abolition, of, tariff, barriers, and, the, abolition, of, monarchical, power, structures, in, favour, of, the, establishment, of, republican, states, or, at, least, the, restriction, of, the, prince, power, in, the, form, of, constitutional, monarchies, in, the, language, of, the, 1840s, democracy, meant, replacing, an, electorate, of, property, owners, with, universal, male, suffrage, liberalism, fundamentally, meant, consent, of, the, governed, restriction, of, church, and, state, power, republican, government, freedom, of, the, press, and, the, individual, the, 1840s, had, seen, the, emergence, of, radical, liberal, publications, such, as, rheinische, zeitung, 1842, le, national, and, la, r, forme, 1843, in, france, ignaz, kuranda, s, grenzboten, 1841, in, austria, lajos, kossuth, s, pesti, h, rlap, 1841, in, hungary, as, well, as, the, increased, popularity, of, the, older, morgenbladet, in, norway, and, the, aftonbladet, in, sweden, nationalism, believed, in, uniting, people, bound, by, some, mix, of, common, languages, culture, religion, shared, history, and, of, course, immediate, geography, there, were, also, irredentist, movements, nationalism, had, developed, a, broader, appeal, during, the, pre, 1848, period, as, seen, in, the, franti, ek, palack, s, 1836, history, of, the, czech, nation, which, emphasised, a, national, lineage, of, conflict, with, the, germans, or, the, popular, patriotic, liederkranz, song, circles, that, were, held, across, germany, patriotic, and, belligerent, songs, about, schleswig, had, dominated, the, w, rzburg, national, song, festival, in, 1845, socialism, in, the, 1840s, was, a, term, without, a, consensus, definition, meaning, different, things, to, different, people, but, was, typically, used, within, a, context, of, more, power, for, workers, in, a, system, based, on, worker, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, these, concepts, together, democracy, liberalism, nationalism, and, socialism, in, the, sense, described, above, came, to, be, encapsulated, in, the, political, term, radicalism, the, world, was, astonished, in, spring, 1848, when, revolutions, appeared, in, so, many, places, and, seemed, on, the, verge, of, success, everywhere, agitators, who, had, been, exiled, by, the, old, governments, rushed, home, to, seize, the, moment, in, france, the, monarchy, was, once, again, overthrown, and, replaced, by, a, republic, in, a, number, of, major, german, and, italian, states, and, in, austria, the, old, leaders, were, forced, to, grant, liberal, constitutions, the, italian, and, german, states, seemed, to, be, rapidly, forming, unified, nations, austria, gave, hungarians, and, czechs, liberal, grants, of, autonomy, and, national, status, in, france, bloody, street, battles, exploded, between, the, middle, class, reformers, and, the, working, class, radicals, german, reformers, argued, endlessly, without, finalizing, their, results, caught, off, guard, at, first, the, aristocracy, and, their, allies, plot, a, return, to, power, the, revolutions, suffer, a, series, of, defeats, in, summer, 1849, reactionaries, returned, to, power, and, many, leaders, of, the, revolution, went, into, exile, some, social, reforms, proved, permanent, and, years, later, nationalists, in, germany, italy, and, hungary, gained, their, objectives, the, first, of, the, numerous, revolutions, to, occur, in, 1848, in, italy, came, in, palermo, sicily, starting, in, january, 1848, there, had, been, several, previous, revolts, against, bourbon, rule, this, one, produced, an, independent, state, that, lasted, only, 16, months, before, the, bourbons, came, back, during, those, months, the, constitution, was, quite, advanced, for, its, time, in, liberal, democratic, terms, as, was, the, proposal, of, a, unified, italian, confederation, of, states, the, revolt, s, failure, was, reversed, 12, years, later, as, the, bourbon, kingdom, of, the, two, sicilies, collapsed, in, 1860, 61, with, the, unification, of, italy, on, 11, february, 1848, leopold, ii, of, tuscany, first, cousin, of, emperor, ferdinand, i, of, austria, granted, the, constitution, with, the, general, approval, of, his, subjects, the, habsburg, example, was, followed, by, charles, albert, of, sardinia, albertine, statute, later, became, the, constitution, of, the, unified, kingdom, of, italy, and, remained, in, force, with, changes, until, 1948, and, by, pope, pius, ix, fundamental, statute, however, only, king, charles, albert, maintained, the, statute, even, after, the, end, of, the, riots, revolts, broke, out, throughout, the, kingdom, of, lombardy, venetia, such, as, the, five, days, of, milan, which, marked, the, beginning, of, the, first, italian, war, of, independence, after, declaring, independence, from, the, habsburg, austrian, empire, the, republic, of, san, marco, later, joined, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, in, an, attempt, led, by, the, latter, to, unite, northern, italy, against, foreign, mainly, austrian, but, also, french, domination, however, the, first, italian, war, of, independence, ended, in, the, defeat, of, sardinia, and, austrian, forces, reconquered, the, republic, of, san, marco, on, 28, august, 1849, following, a, long, siege, based, on, the, venetian,

themselves, it, ended, the, constitutional, monarchy, of, louis, philippe, and, led, to, the, creation, of, the, french, second, republic, after, an, interim, period, louis, napoleon, the, nephew, of,

that, the, danish, king, s, first, words, after, signing, away, his, absolute, power, were, that, was, nice, now, i, can, sleep, in, the, mornings, although, army, officers, were, dissatisfied, they,

course, of, the, revolution, to, achieve, either, autonomy, independence, or, even, hegemony, over, other, nationalities, the, nationalist, picture, was, further, complicated, by, the, simultaneous, events, in, the, german, states, which, moved, toward, greater, german, national, unity, the, hungarian, revolution, of, 1848, was, the, longest, in, europe, crushed, in, august, 1849, by, austrian, and, russian, armies, nevertheless, it, had, a, major, effect, in, freeing, the, serfs, it, started, on, 15, march, 1848, when, hungarian, patriots, organized, mass, demonstrations, in, pest, and, buda, today, budapest, which, forced, the, imperial, governor, to, accept, their, 12, points, of, demands, which, included, the, demand, for, freedom, of, press, an, independent, hungarian, ministry,

some, other, liberal, nobility, that, made, up, the, diet, appealed, to, the, habsburg, court, with, demands, for, representative, government, and, civil, liberties, these, events, resulted, in, klemens, von, metternich, the, austrian, chancellor, and, foreign, minister, resigning, the, demands, of, the, diet, were, agreed, upon, on, 18, march, by, emperor, ferdinand, although, hungary, would, remain, part, of, the, monarchy, through, personal, union, with, the, emperor, a, constitutional, government, would, be, founded, the, diet, then, passed, the, april, laws, that, established, equality, before, the, law, a, legislature, a, hereditary, constitutional, monarchy, and, an, end, to, the, transfer, and, restrictions, of, land, use, the, revolution, grew, into, a, war, for, independence, from, the, habsburg, monarchy, when, josip, jela, i, ban, of, croatia, crossed, the, border, to, restore, their, control, the, new, government, led, by, lajos, kossuth, was, initially, successful, against, the, habsburg, forces, although, hungary, took, a, national, united, stand, for, its, freedom, some, minorities, of, the, kingdom, of, hungary, including, the, serbs, of, vojvodina, the, romanians, of, transylvania, and, some, slovaks, of, upper, hungary, supported, the, habsburg, emperor, and, fought, against, the, hungarian, revolutionary, army, eventually, after, one, and, a, half, years, of, fighting, the, revolution, was, crushed, when, russian, tsar, nicholas, i, marched, into, hungary, with, over, 300, 000, troops, as, result, of, the, defeat, hungary, was, thus, placed, under, brutal, martial, law, the, leading, rebels, like, kossuth, fled, into, exile, or, were, executed, in, the, long, run, the, passive, resistance, following, the, revolution, along, with, the, crushing, austrian, defeat, in, the, 1866, austro, prussian, war, led, to, the, austro, hungarian, compromise, 1867, which, marked, the, birth, of, the, austro, hungarian, empire, the, center, of, the, ukrainian, national, movement, was, in, galicia, which, is, today, divided, between, ukraine, and, poland, on, 19, april, 1848, a, group, of, representatives, led, by, the,

the, majority, the, ukrainian, language, should, be, taught, at, schools, and, used, to, announce, official, decrees, for, the, peasantry, local, officials, were, expected, to, understand, it, and, the, ruthenian, clergy, was, to, be, equalized, in, their, rights, with, the, clergy, of, all, other, denominations, on, 2, may, 1848, the, supreme, ruthenian, council, was, established, the, council,

republics, also, saw, an, internal, struggle, the, attempted, secession, of, seven, catholic, cantons, to, form, an, alliance, known, as, the, sonderbund, separate, alliance, in, 1845, led, to, a, short, civil, conflict, in, november, 1847, in, which, around, 100, people, were, killed, the, sonderbund, was, decisively, defeated, by, the, protestant, cantons, which, had, a, larger, population,

against, the, prussians, in, the, grand, duchy, of, posen, or, the, greater, poland, region, a, part, of, prussia, since, its, annexation, in, 1815, the, poles, tried, to, establish, a, polish, political, entity, but, refused, to, cooperate, with, the, germans, and, the, jews, the, germans, decided, they, were, better, off, with, the, status, quo, so, they, assisted, the, prussian, governments, in, recapturing, control, in, the, long, term, the, uprising, stimulated, nationalism, among, both, the, poles, and, the, germans, and, brought, civil, equality, to, the, jews, a, romanian, liberal, and, romantic, nationalist, uprising, began, in, june, in, the, principality, of, wallachia, its, goals, were, administrative, autonomy, abolition, of, serfdom, and, popular, self, determination, it, was, closely, connected, with, the, 1848, unsuccessful, revolt, in, moldavia, it, sought, to, overturn, the, administration, imposed, by, imperial, russian, authorities, under, the, regulamentul, organic, regime, and, through, many, of, its, leaders, demanded, the, abolition, of, boyar, privilege, led, by, a, group, of, young, intellectuals, and, officers, in, the, wallachian, military, forces, the, movement, succeeded, in, toppling, the, ruling, prince, gheorghe, bibescu, whom, it, replaced, with, a, provisional, government, and, a, regency, and, in, passing, a, series, of, major, liberal, reforms, first, announced, in, the, proclamation, of, islaz, despite, its, rapid, gains, and, popular, backing, the, new, administration, was, marked, by, conflicts, between, the, radical, wing, and, more, conservative, forces, especially, over, the, issue, of, land, reform, two, successive, abortive, coups, weakened, the, new, government, and, its, international, status, was, always, contested, by, russia, after, managing, to, rally, a, degree, of, sympathy, from, ottoman, political, leaders, the, revolution, was, ultimately, isolated, by, the, intervention, of, russian, diplomats, in, september, 1848, by, agreement, with, the, ottomans, russia, invaded, and, put, down, the, revolution, according, to, vasile, maciu, the, failures, were, attributable, in, wallachia, to, foreign, intervention, in, moldavia, to, the, opposition, of, the, feudalists, and, in, transylvania, to, the, failure, of, the, campaigns, of, general, j, zef, bem, and, later, to, austrian, repression, in, later, decades, the, rebels, returned, and, gained, their, goals, belgium, did, not, see, major, unrest, in, 1848, it, had, already, undergone, a, liberal, reform, after, the, revolution, of, 1830, and, thus, its, constitutional, system, and, its, monarchy, survived, a, number, of, small, local, riots, broke, out, concentrated, in, the, sillon, industriel, industrial, region, of, the, provinces, of, li, ge, and, hainaut, the, most, serious, threat, of, revolutionary, contagion, however, was, posed, by, belgian, migr, groups, from, france, in, 1830, the, belgian, revolution, had, broken, out, inspired, by, the, revolution, occurring, in, france, and, belgian, authorities, feared, that, a, similar, copycat, phenomenon, might, occur, in, 1848, shortly, after, the, revolution, in, france, belgian, migrant, workers, living, in, paris, were, encouraged, to, return, to, belgium, to, overthrow, the, monarchy, and, establish, a, republic, belgian, authorities, expelled, karl, marx, himself, from, brussels, in, early, march, on, accusations, of, having, used, part, of, his, inheritance, to, arm, belgian, revolutionaries, around, 6, 000, armed, migr, s, of, the, belgian, legion, attempted, to, cross, the, belgian, frontier, there, were, two, divisions, which, were, formed, the, first, group, travelling, by, train, were, stopped, and, quickly, disarmed, at, qui, vrain, on, 26, march, 1848, the, second, group, crossed, the, border, on, 29, march, and, headed, for, brussels, they, were, confronted, by, belgian, troops, at, the, hamlet, of, risquons, tout, and, defeated, several, smaller, groups, managed, to, infiltrate, belgium, but, the, reinforced, belgian, border, troops, succeeded, and, the, defeat, at, risquons, tout, effectively, ended, the, revolutionary, threat, to, belgium, the, situation, in, belgium, began, to, recover, that, summer, after, a, good, harvest, and, fresh, elections, returned, a, strong, majority, to, the, governing, party, a, tendency, common, in, the, revolutionary, movements, of, 1848, was, a, perception, that, the, liberal, monarchies, set, up, in, the, 1830s, despite, formally, being, representative, parliamentary, democracies, were, too, oligarchical, and, or, corrupt, to, respond, to, the, urgent, needs, of, the, people, and, were, therefore, in, need, of, drastic, democratic, overhaul, or, failing, that, separatism, to, build, a, democratic, state, from, scratch, this, was, the, process, that, occurred, in, ireland, between, 1801, and, 1848, previously, a, separate, kingdom, ireland, was, incorporated, into, the, united, kingdom, in, 1801, although, its, population, was, made, up, largely, of, catholics, and, sociologically, of, agricultural, workers, tensions, arose, from, the, political, over, representation, in, positions, of, power, of, landowners, of, protestant, background, who, were, loyal, to, the, united, kingdom, from, the, 1810s, a, conservative, liberal, movement, led, by, daniel, o, connell, had, sought, to, secure, equal, political, rights, for, catholics, within, the, british, political, system, successful, in, the, roman, catholic, relief, act, 1829, but, as, in, other, european, states, a, current, inspired, by, radicalism, criticized, the, conservative, liberals, for, pursuing, the, aim, of, democratic, equality, with, excessive, compromise, and, gradualism, in, ireland, a, current, of, nationalist, egalitarian, and, radical, republicanism, inspired, by, the, french, revolution, had, been, present, since, the, 1790s, being, expressed, initially, in, the, irish, rebellion, of, 1798, this, tendency, grew, into, a, movement, for, social, cultural, and, political, reform, during, the, 1830s, and, in, 1839, was, realized, into, a, political, association, called, young, ireland, it, was, initially, not, well, received, but, grew, more, popular, with, the, great, famine, of, 1845, 1849, an, event, that, brought, catastrophic, social, effects, and, which, threw, into, light, the, inadequate, response, of, authorities, the, spark, for, the, young, irelander, revolution, came, in, 1848, when, the, british, parliament, passed, the, crime, and, outrage, bill, the, bill, was, essentially, a, declaration, of, martial, law, in, ireland, designed, to, create, a, counter, insurgency, against, the, growing, irish, nationalist, movement, in, response, the, young, ireland, party, launched, its, rebellion, in, july, 1848, gathering, landlords, and, tenants, to, its, cause, but, its, first, major, engagement, against, police, in, the, village, of, ballingarry, south, tipperary, was, a, failure, a, long, gunfight, with, around, 50, armed, police, ended, when, police, reinforcements, arrived, after, the, arrest, of, the, young, ireland, leaders, the, rebellion, collapsed, though, intermittent, fighting, continued, for, the, next, year, it, is, sometimes, called, the, famine, rebellion, since, it, took, place, during, the, great, famine, while, no, revolution, occurred, in, spain, in, the, year, 1848, a, similar, phenomenon, occurred, during, this, year, the, country, was, going, through, the, second, carlist, war, the, european, revolutions, erupted, at, a, moment, when, the, political, regime, in, spain, faced, great, criticism, from, within, one, of, its, two, main, parties, and, by, 1854, a, radical, liberal, revolution, and, a, conservative, liberal, counter, revolution, had, both, occurred, since, 1833, spain, had, been, governed, by, a, conservative, liberal, parliamentary, monarchy, similar, to, and, modelled, on, the, july, monarchy, in, france, in, order, to, exclude, absolute, monarchists, from, government, power, had, alternated, between, two, liberal, parties, the, center, left, progressive, party, and, the, center, right, moderate, party, but, a, decade, of, rule, by, the, center, right, moderates, had, recently, produced, a, constitutional, reform, 1845, prompting, fears, that, the, moderates, sought, to, reach, out, to, absolutists, and, permanently, exclude, the, progressives, the, left, wing, of, the, progressive, party, which, had, historical, links, to, jacobinism, and, radicalism, began, to, push, for, root, and, branch, reforms, to, the, constitutional, monarchy, notably, universal, male, suffrage, and, parliamentary, sovereignty, the, european, revolutions, of, 1848, and, particularly, the, french, second, republic, prompted, the, spanish, radical, movement, to, adopt, positions, incompatible, with, the, existing, constitutional, regime, notably, republicanism, this, ultimately, led, the, radicals, to, exit, the, progressive, party, to, form, the, democratic, party, in, 1849, over, the, next, years, two, revolutions, occurred, in, 1854, the, conservatives, of, the, moderate, party, were, ousted, after, a, decade, in, power, by, an, alliance, of, radicals, liberals, and, liberal, conservatives, led, by, generals, espartero, and, o, donnell, in, 1856, the, more, conservative, half, of, this, alliance, launched, a, second, revolution, to, oust, the, republican, radicals, leading, to, a, new, 10, year, period, of, government, by, conservative, liberal, monarchists, taken, together, the, two, revolutions, can, be, thought, of, as, echoing, aspects, of, the, french, second, republic, the, spanish, revolution, of, 1854, as, a, revolt, by, radicals, and, liberals, against, the, oligarchical, conservative, liberal, parliamentary, monarchy, of, the, 1830s, mirrored, the, french, revolution, of, 1848, while, the, spanish, revolution, of, 1856, as, a, counter, revolution, of, conservative, liberals, under, a, military, strongman, had, echoes, of, louis, napol, on, bonaparte, s, coup, against, the, french, second, republic, the, united, kingdom, belgium, the, netherlands, portugal, the, russian, empire, including, poland, and, finland, and, the, ottoman, empire, did, not, encounter, major, national, or, radical, revolutions, in, 1848, sweden, and, norway, were, also, little, affected, serbia, though, formally, unaffected, by, the, revolt, as, it, was, a, part, of, the, ottoman, state, actively, supported, serbian, revolutionaries, in, the, habsburg, empire, in, some, countries, uprisings, had, already, occurred, demanding, similar, reforms, to, the, revolutions, of, 1848, but, with, little, success, this, was, the, case, for, the, kingdom, of, poland, and, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, which, had, seen, a, series, of, uprisings, before, or, after, but, not, during, 1848, the, november, uprising, of, 1830, 1831, the, krak, w, uprising, of, 1846, notable, for, being, quelled, by, the, anti, revolutionary, galician, slaughter, and, later, on, the, january, uprising, of, 1863, 1865, in, other, countries, the, relative, calm, could, be, attributed, to, the, fact, that, they, had, already, gone, through, revolutions, or, civil, wars, in, the, preceding, years, and, therefore, already, enjoyed, many, of, the, reforms, which, radicals, elsewhere, were, demanding, in, 1848, this, was, largely, the, case, for, belgium, the, belgian, revolution, in, 1830, 1831, portugal, the, large, liberal, wars, of, 1828, 1834, and, the, minor, civil, war, of, patuleia, in, 1846, 1847, and, switzerland, the, sonderbund, war, of, 1847, in, yet, other, countries, the, absence, of, unrest, was, partly, due, to, governments, taking, action, to, prevent, revolutionary, unrest, and, pre, emptively, grant, some, of, the, reforms, demanded, by, revolutionaries, elsewhere, this, was, notably, the, case, for, the, netherlands, where, king, william, ii, decided, to, alter, the, dutch, constitution, to, reform, elections, and, voluntarily, reduce, the, power, of, the, monarchy, the, same, might, be, said, of, switzerland, where, a, new, constitutional, regime, was, introduced, in, 1848, the, swiss, federal, constitution, was, a, revolution, of, sorts, laying, the, foundation, of, swiss, society, as, it, is, today, while, no, major, political, upheavals, occurred, in, the, ottoman, empire, as, such, political, unrest, did, occur, in, some, of, its, vassal, states, in, serbia, feudalism, was, abolished, and, the, power, of, the, serbian, prince, was, reduced, with, the, constitution, of, serbia, in, 1838, in, the, united, kingdom, while, the, middle, classes, had, been, pacified, by, their, inclusion, in, the, extension, of, the, franchise, in, the, reform, act, 1832, the, consequential, agitations, violence, and, petitions, of, the, chartist, movement, came, to, a, head, with, their, peaceful, petition, to, parliament, of, 1848, the, repeal, in, 1846, of, the, protectionist, agricultural, tariffs, called, the, corn, laws, had, defused, some, proletarian, fervour, in, the, isle, of, man, there, were, ongoing, efforts, to, reform, the, self, elected, house, of, keys, but, no, revolution, took, place, some, of, the, reformers, were, encouraged, by, events, in, france, in, particular, in, the, united, states, opinions, were, polarized, with, democrats, and, reformers, in, favour, although, they, were, distressed, at, the, degree, of, violence, involved, opposition, came, from, conservative, elements, especially, whigs, southern, slaveholders, orthodox, calvinists, and, catholics, about, 4, 000, german, exiles, arrived, and, some, became, fervent, republicans, in, the, 1850s, such, as, carl, schurz, kossuth, toured, america, and, won, great, applause, but, no, volunteers, or, diplomatic, or, financial, help, following, rebellions, in, 1837, and, 1838, 1848, in, canada, saw, the, establishment, of, responsible, government, in, nova, scotia, and, the, canadas, the, first, such, governments, in, the, british, empire, outside, the, united, kingdom, john, ralston, saul, has, argued, that, this, development, is, tied, to, the, revolutions, in, europe, but, described, the, canadian, approach, to, the, revolutionary, year, of, 1848, as, talking, their, way, out, of, the, empire, s, control, system, and, into, a, new, democratic, model, a, stable, democratic, system, which, has, lasted, to, the, present, day, tory, and, orange, order, in, canada, opposition, to, responsible, government, came, to, a, head, in, riots, triggered, by, the, rebellion, losses, bill, in, 1849, they, succeeded, in, the, burning, of, the, parliament, buildings, in, montreal, but, unlike, their, counterrevolutionary, counterparts, in, europe, they, were, ultimately, unsuccessful, in, spanish, latin, america, the, revolution, of, 1848, appeared, in, new, granada, where, colombian, students, liberals, and, intellectuals, demanded, the, election, of, general, jos, hilario, l, pez, he, took, power, in, 1849, and, launched, major, reforms, abolishing, slavery, and, the, death, penalty, and, providing, freedom, of, the, press, and, of, religion, the, resulting, turmoil, in, colombia, lasted, three, decades, from, 1851, to, 1885, the, country, was, ravaged, by, four, general, civil, wars, and, 50, local, revolutions, in, chile, the, 1848, revolutions, inspired, the, 1851, chilean, revolution, in, brazil, the, praieira, revolt, a, movement, in, pernambuco, lasted, from, november, 1848, to, 1852, unresolved, conflicts, from, the, period, of, the, regency, and, local, resistance, to, the, consolidation, of, the, brazilian, empire, that, had, been, proclaimed, in, 1822, helped, to, plant, the, seeds, of, the, revolution, in, mexico, the, conservative, government, led, by, santa, anna, lost, california, and, half, of, the, territory, to, the, united, states, in, the, mexican, american, war, of, 1845, 1848, derived, from, this, catastrophe, and, chronic, stability, problems, the, liberal, party, started, a, reformist, movement, this, movement, via, elections, led, liberals, to, formulate, the, plan, of, ayutla, the, plan, written, in, 1854, aimed, at, removing, conservative, centralist, president, antonio, l, pez, de, santa, anna, from, control, of, mexico, during, the, second, federal, republic, of, mexico, period, initially, it, seemed, little, different, from, other, political, plans, of, the, era, but, it, is, considered, the, first, act, of, the, liberal, reform, in, mexico, it, was, the, catalyst, for, revolts, in, many, parts, of, mexico, which, led, to, the, resignation, of, santa, anna, from, the, presidency, never, to, vie, for, office, again, the, next, presidents, of, mexico, were, the, liberals, juan, lvarez, ignacio, comonfort, and, benito, ju, rez, the, new, regime, would, then, proclaim, the, 1857, mexican, constitution, which, implemented, a, variety, of, liberal, reforms, among, other, things, these, reforms, confiscated, religious, property, aimed, to, promote, economic, development, and, to, stabilize, a, nascent, republican, government, the, reforms, led, directly, to, the, so, called, three, years, war, or, reform, war, of, 1857, the, liberals, won, this, war, but, the, conservatives, solicited, the, french, government, of, napoleon, iii, for, a, european, conservative, monarch, deriving, into, the, second, french, intervention, in, mexico, under, the, puppet, habsburg, government, of, maximilian, i, of, mexico, the, country, became, a, client, state, of, france, 1863, 1867, we, have, been, beaten, and, humiliated, scattered, imprisoned, disarmed, and, gagged, the, fate, of, european, democracy, has, slipped, from, our, hands, pierre, joseph, proudhon, historian, priscilla, robertson, posits, that, many, goals, were, achieved, by, the, 1870s, but, the, credit, primarily, goes, to, the, enemies, of, the, 1848, revolutionaries, commenting, most, of, what, the, men, of, 1848, fought, for, was, brought, about, within, a, quarter, of, a, century, and, the, men, who, accomplished, it, were, most, of, them, specific, enemies, of, the, 1848, movement, thiers, ushered, in, a, third,

fraternity, for, nationalists, 1848, was, the, springtime, of, hope, when, newly, emerging, nationalities, rejected, the, old, multinational, empires, but, the, end, results, were, not, as, comprehensive, as, many, had, hoped, communists, denounced, 1848, as, a, betrayal, of, working, class, ideals, by, a, bourgeoisie, indifferent, to, the, legitimate, demands, of, the, proletariat, the, view, of, the, revolutions, of, 1848, as, a, bourgeois, revolution, is, also, common, in, non, marxist, scholarship, middle, class, anxiety, and, different, approaches, between, bourgeois, revolutionaries, and, radicals, led, to, the, failure, of, revolutions, many, governments, engaged, in, a, partial, reversal, of, the, revolutionary, reforms, of, 1848, 1849, as, well, as, heightened, repression, and, censorship, the, hanoverian, nobility, successfully, appealed, to, the, confederal, diet, in, 1851, over, the, loss, of, their, noble, privileges, while, the, prussian, junkers,

repressive, marked, by, an, expansion, of, the, secret, police, the, tretiye, otdeleniye, and, stricter, censorship, there, were, more, russians, working, for, censorship, organs, than, actual, books,

changes, more, recently, christopher, clark, has, characterised, the, period, that, followed, 1848, as, one, dominated, by, a, revolution, in, government, karl, marx, expressed, disappointment, at, the, bourgeois, character, of, the, revolutions, marx, elaborated, in, his, 1850, address, of, the, central, committee, to, the, communist, league, a, theory, of, permanent, revolution, according, to, which, the, proletariat, should, strengthen, democratic, bourgeois, revolutionary, forces, until, the, proletariat, itself, is, ready, to, seize, power, the, prussian, prime, minister, otto, von,

followed, by, new, centrist, coalitions, dominated, by, liberals, nervous, of, the, threat, of, working, class, socialism, as, seen, in, the, piedmontese, connubio, under, camillo, benso, count, of, cavour, governments, after, 1848, were, forced, into, managing, the, public, sphere, and, popular, sphere, with, more, effectiveness, resulting, in, the, increased, prominence, of, the, prussian,

conspiracies, that, presented, jews, as, representative, both, of, the, forces, of, social, revolution, apparently, typified, in, joseph, goldmark, and, adolf, fischhof, of, vienna, and, of, international, capital, as, seen, in, the, 1848, report, from, eduard, von, m, ller, tellering, the, viennese, correspondent, of, karl, marx, s, neue, rheinische, zeitung, which, declared, that, tyranny, comes, from, money, and, the, money, belongs, to, the, jews, about, 4, 000, exiles, went, to, the, united, states, fleeing, the, reactionary, purges, of, these, 100, went, to, the, texas,
