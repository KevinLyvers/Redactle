the, g, kt, rks, celestial, turks, or, blue, turks, old, turkic, romanized, t, r, k, bodun, chinese, pinyin, t, ju, wade, giles, t, u, ch, eh, were, a, turkic, people, in, medieval, inner, asia, the, g, kt, rks, under, the, leadership, of, bumin, qaghan, d, 552, and, his, sons, succeeded, the, rouran, khaganate, as, the, main, power, in, the, region, and, established, the, first, turkic, khaganate, one, of, several, nomadic, dynasties, that, would, shape, the, future, geolocation, culture, and, dominant, beliefs, of, turkic, peoples, the, common, name, g, kt, rk, emerged, from, the, misreading, of, the, word, k, k, meaning, ashina, the, endonym, of, the, ruling, clan, of, the, historical, ethnic, group, which, was, attested, as, old, turkic, romanized, t, r, k, old, turkic, romanized, k, k, t, r, k, or, old, turkic, romanized, t, rk, it, is, generally, accepted, that, the, name, t, rk, is, ultimately, derived, from, the, old, turkic, migration, term, t, r, k, t, r, k, which, means, created, born, they, were, known, in, middle, chinese, historical, sources, as, the, t, ju, chinese, reconstructed, in, middle, chinese, as, romanized, dw, t, ku, t, t, ut, kyat, the, ethnonym, was, also, recorded, in, various, other, middle, asian, languages, such, as, sogdian, t, rkit, t, rk, t, tr, wkt, trwkt, turkt, trwkc, truk, khotanese, saka, tt, rka, ttr, ka, rouran, to, ro, x, t, r, g, korean, dolgwol, and, old, tibetan, drugu, according, to, chinese, sources, t, ju, meant, combat, helmet, chinese, pinyin, d, um, u, wade, giles, tou, 1, mou, 2, reportedly, because, the, shape, of, the, altai, mountains, where, they, lived, was, similar, to, a, combat, helmet, r, na, tas, 1991, pointed, to, a, khotanese, saka, word, tturak, lid, semantically, stretchable, to, helmet, as, a, possible, source, for, this, folk, etymology, yet, golden, thinks, this, connection, requires, more, data, g, kt, rk, is, sometimes, interpreted, as, either, celestial, turk, or, blue, turk, i, e, because, sky, blue, is, associated, with, celestial, realms, this, is, consistent, with, the, cult, of, heavenly, ordained, rule, which, was, a, recurrent, element, of, altaic, political, culture, and, as, such, may, have, been, imbibed, by, the, g, kt, rks, from, their, predecessors, in, mongolia, blue, is, traditionally, associated, with, the, east, as, it, used, in, the, cardinal, system, of, central, asia, thus, meaning, turks, of, the, east, the, name, of, the, ruling, ashina, clan, may, derive, from, the, khotanese, saka, term, for, deep, blue, na, according, to, the, american, heritage, dictionary, the, word, t, rk, meant, strong, in, old, turkic, though, gerhard, doerfer, supports, this, theory, gerard, clauson, points, out, that, the, word, t, rk, is, never, used, in, the, generalized, sense, of, strong, and, that, the, noun, t, rk, originally, meant, the, culminating, point, of, maturity, of, a, fruit, human, being, etc, but, more, often, used, as, an, meaning, of, a, fruit, just, fully, ripe, of, a, human, being, in, the, prime, of, life, young, and, vigorous, hakan, aydemir, 2022, also, contends, that, t, rk, originally, did, not, mean, strong, powerful, but, gathered, united, allied, confederated, and, was, derived, from, pre, proto, turkic, verb, t, r, heap, up, collect, gather, assemble, the, name, as, used, by, the, g, kt, rks, only, applied, to, themselves, the, g, kt, rk, khanates, and, their, subjects, the, g, kt, rks, did, not, consider, other, turkic, speaking, groups, such, as, the, uyghurs, tiele, and, kyrgyz, to, be, t, rks, in, the, orkhon, inscriptions, the, toquz, oghuz, and, the, yenisei, kyrgyz, are, not, referred, to, as, t, rks, similarly, the, uyghurs, called, themselves, uyghurs, and, used, t, rk, exclusively, for, the, g, kt, rks, whom, they, portrayed, as, enemy, aliens, in, their, royal, inscriptions, the, khazars, may, have, kept, the, g, kt, rk, tradition, alive, by, claiming, descent, from, the, ashina, when, tribal, leaders, built, their, khanates, ruling, over, assorted, tribes, and, tribal, unions, the, collected, people, identified, themselves, politically, with, the, leadership, turk, became, the, designation, for, all, subjects, of, the, turk, empires, nonetheless, subordinate, tribes, and, tribal, unions, retained, their, original, names, identities, and, social, structures, memory, of, the, g, kt, rks, and, the, ashina, had, faded, by, the, turn, of, the, millennium, the, karakhanids, qocho, uyghurs, and, seljuks, did, not, claim, descent, from, the, g, kt, rks, the, g, kt, rk, rulers, originated, from, the, ashina, clan, who, were, first, attested, to, in, 439, the, book, of, sui, reports, that, in, that, year, on, 18, october, the, tuoba, ruler, emperor, taiwu, of, northern, wei, overthrew, juqu, mujian, of, the, northern, liang, in, eastern, gansu, whence, 500, ashina, families, fled, northwest, to, the, rouran, khaganate, in, the, vicinity, of, gaochang, according, to, the, book, of, zhou, and, history, of, the, northern, dynasties, the, ashina, clan, was, a, component, of, the, xiongnu, confederation, specifically, the, northern, xiongnu, tribes, or, southern, xiongnu, who, settled, along, the, northern, chinese, frontier, according, to, edwin, g, pulleyblank, however, this, view, is, contested, g, kt, rks, were, also, posited, as, having, originated, from, an, obscure, suo, state, mc, s, k, which, was, situated, north, of, the, xiongnu, and, had, been, founded, by, the, sakas, or, xianbei, according, to, the, book, of, sui, and, the, tongdian, they, were, mixed, hu, barbarians, from, pingliang, now, in, gansu, northwest, china, pointing, to, the, ashina, s, association, with, the, northern, tribes, of, the, xiongnu, some, researchers, e, g, duan, lung, etc, proposed, that, g, kt, rks, belonged, in, particular, to, the, tiele, confederation, likewise, xiongnu, associated, by, ancestral, lineage, however, lee, and, kuang, 2017, state, that, chinese, sources, do, not, describe, the, ashina, led, g, kt, rks, s, descending, from, the, dingling, or, belonging, to, the, tiele, confederation, chinese, sources, linked, the, hu, on, their, northern, borders, to, the, xiongnu, just, as, graeco, roman, historiographers, called, the, pannonian, avars, huns, and, hungarians, scythians, such, archaizing, was, a, common, literary, topos, implying, similar, geographic, origins, and, nomadic, lifestyle, but, not, direct, filiation, as, part, of, the, heterogeneous, rouran, khaganate, the, turks, lived, for, generations, north, of, the, altai, mountains, where, they, engaged, in, metal, working, for, the, rouran, according, to, denis, sinor, the, rise, to, power, of, the, ashina, clan, represented, an, internal, revolution, in, the, rouran, khaganate, rather, than, an, external, conquest, according, to, charles, holcombe, the, early, turk, population, was, rather, heterogeneous, and, many, of, the, names, of, turk, rulers, including, the, two, founding, members, are, not, even, turkic, this, is, supported, by, evidence, from, the, orkhon, inscriptions, which, include, several, non, turkic, lexemes, possibly, representing, uralic, or, yeniseian, words, peter, benjamin, golden, points, out, that, the, khaghans, of, the, turkic, khaganate, the, ashina, who, were, of, an, undetermined, ethnic, origin, adopted, iranian, and, tokharian, or, non, altaic, titles, german, turkologist, w, e, scharlipp, points, out, that, many, common, terms, in, turkic, are, iranian, in, origin, whatever, language, the, ashina, may, have, spoken, originally, they, and, those, they, ruled, would, all, speak, turkic, in, a, variety, of, dialects, and, create, in, a, broadly, defined, sense, a, common, culture, the, g, kt, rks, reached, their, peak, in, the, late, 6th, century, and, began, to, invade, the, sui, dynasty, of, china, however, the, war, ended, due, to, the, division, of, turkic, nobles, and, their, civil, war, for, the, throne, of, khagan, with, the, support, of, emperor, wen, of, sui, yami, qaghan, won, the, competition, however, the, g, kt, rk, empire, was, divided, to, eastern, and, western, empires, weakened, by, the, civil, war, yami, qaghan, declared, allegiance, to, the, sui, dynasty, when, sui, began, to, decline, shibi, khagan, began, to, assault, its, territory, and, even, surrounded, emperor, yang, of, sui, in, siege, of, yanmen, 615, ad, with, 100, 000, cavalry, troops, after, the, collapse, of, the, sui, dynasty, the, g, kt, rks, intervened, in, the, ensuing, chinese, civil, wars, providing, support, to, the, northeastern, rebel, liu, heita, against, the, rising, tang, in, 622, and, 623, liu, enjoyed, a, long, string, of, success, but, was, finally, routed, by, li, shimin, and, other, tang, generals, and, executed, the, tang, dynasty, was, then, established, although, the, g, kt, rk, khaganate, once, provided, support, to, the, tang, dynasty, in, the, early, period, of, the, civil, war, during, the, collapse, of, the, sui, dynasty, the, conflicts, between, the, g, kt, rks, and, tang, finally, broke, out, when, tang, was, gradually, reunifying, china, proper, the, g, kt, rks, began, to, attack, and, raid, the, northern, border, of, the, tang, empire, and, once, marched, their, main, force, of, 100, 000, soldiers, to, chang, an, the, capital, of, tang, the, emperor, taizong, of, the, tang, in, spite, of, the, limited, resources, at, his, disposal, managed, to, turn, them, back, later, taizong, sent, his, troops, to, mongolia, and, defeated, the, main, force, of, g, kt, rk, army, in, battle, of, yinshan, four, years, later, and, captured, illig, qaghan, in, 630, ad, with, the, submission, of, the, turkic, tribes, the, tang, conquered, the, mongolian, plateau, from, then, on, the, eastern, turks, were, subjugated, to, china, after, a, vigorous, court, debate, emperor, taizong, decided, to, pardon, the, g, kt, rk, nobles, and, offered, them, positions, as, imperial, guards, however, the, proposition, was, ended, by, a, plan, for, the, assassination, of, the, emperor, on, 19, may, 639, ashina, jiesheshuai, and, his, tribesmen, directly, assaulted, emperor, taizong, of, tang, at, jiucheng, palace, in, present, day, linyou, county, baoji, shaanxi, however, they, did, not, succeed, and, fled, to, the, north, but, were, caught, by, pursuers, near, the, wei, river, and, were, killed, ashina, hexiangu, was, exiled, to, lingbiao, after, the, unsuccessful, raid, of, ashina, jiesheshuai, on, 13, august, 639,

of, the, samples, of, y, dna, belonged, to, the, west, eurasian, haplogroup, r1, while, the, other, 50, belonged, to, east, eurasian, haplogroups, q, and, o, the, extracted, samples, of, mtdna, belonged, mainly, to, east, eurasian, haplogroups, c4b1, a14, and, a15c, while, one, specimen, carried, the, west, eurasian, haplogroup, h2a, the, authors, suggested, that, central, asian, nomadic, populations, may, have, been, turkicized, by, an, east, asian, minority, elite, resulting, in, a, small, but, detectable, increase, in, east, asian, ancestry, however, these, authors, also, found, that, t, rkic, period, individuals, were, extremely, genetically, diverse, with, some, individuals, being, of, complete, west, eurasian, descent, to, explain, this, diversity, of, ancestry, they, propose, that, there, were, also, incoming, west, eurasians, moving, eastward, on, the, eurasian, steppe, during, the, t, rkic, period, resulting, in, admixture, a, 2020, study, analyzed, genetic, data, from, 7, early, medieval, t, rk, skeletal, remains, from, turkic, khaganate, burial, sites, in, mongolia, the, authors, described, the, t, rk, samples, as, highly, diverse, carrying, on, average, 40, west, eurasian, and, 60, east, eurasian, ancestry, west, eurasian, ancestry, in, the, t, rks, combined, sarmatian, related, and, bmac, ancestry, while, the, east, eurasian, ancestry, was, related, to, ancient, northeast, asians, the, authors, also, observed, that, the, western, steppe, herder, ancestry, in, the, t, rks, was, largely, inherited, from, male, ancestors, which, also, corresponds, with, the, marked, increase, of, paternal, haplogroups, such, as, r, and, j, during, the, t, rkic, period, in, mongolia, admixture, between, east, and, west, eurasian, ancestors, of, the, t, rkic, samples, was, dated, to, 500, ad, which, is, 8, generations, prior, three, of, the, t, rkic, affiliated, males, carried, the, paternal, haplogroups, j2a, and, j1a, two, carried, haplogroup, c, f3830, and, one, carried, r1a, z93, the, analyzed, maternal, haplogroups, were, identified, as, d4, d2, b4, c4, h1, and, u7, a, 2023, study, published, in, the, journal, of, systematics, and, evolution, analyzed, the, dna, of, empress, ashina, 551, 582, a, royal, g, kt, rk, and, immediate, descendant, of, the, first, khagans, whose, remains, were, recovered, from, a, mausoleum, in, xianyang, china, the, authors, determined, that, empress, ashina, belonged, to, the, north, east, asian, mtdna, haplogroup, f1d, approximately, 96, 98, of, her, autosomal, ancestry, was, of, ancient, northeast, asian, origin, while, roughly, 2, 4, was, of, west, eurasian, origin, indicating, ancient, admixture, and, no, chinese, yellow, river, admixture, the, results, are, consistent, with, a, north, east, asian, origin, of, the, royal, ashina, family, and, the, g, kt, rk, khaganate, however, the, ashina, did, not, show, close, genetic, affinity, with, central, steppe, t, rks, and, early, medieval, t, rks, who, exhibit, a, high, but, variable, degree, of, west, eurasian, ancestry, which, indicates, that, there, was, genetic, sub, structure, within, the, t, rkic, empire, for, example, the, ancestry, of, early, medieval, turks, was, derived, from, ancient, northeast, asians, for, about, 62, of, their, genome, while, the, remaining, 38, was, derived, from, west, eurasians, bmac, and, afanasievo, with, the, admixture, occurring, around, the, year, 500, ce, the, ashina, was, found, to, share, genetic, affinities, to, post, iron, age, tungusic, and, mongolic, pastoralists, and, was, genetically, closer, to, east, asians, while, having, heterogeneous, relationships, towards, various, turkic, speaking, groups, in, central, asia, suggesting, genetic, heterogeneity, and, multiple, sources, of, origin, for, the, population, of, the, turkic, empire, this, shows, that, the, ashina, lineage, had, a, dominating, contribution, on, mongolic, and, tungusic, speakers, but, limited, contribution, on, turkic, speaking, populations, according, to, the, authors, these, findings, once, again, validates, a, cultural, diffusion, model, over, a, demic, diffusion, model, for, the, spread, of, turkic, languages, and, refutes, the, western, eurasian, origin, and, multiple, origin, hypotheses, in, favor, of, an, east, asian, origin, for, the, royal, ashina, family, two, t, rk, remains, gd1, 1, and, gd2, 4, analysed, in, a, 2024, paper, were, found, to, display, only, little, to, no, west, eurasian, ancestry, one, of, the, t, rk, remains, gd1, 1, was, derived, entirely, from, an, ancient, northeast, asian, source, represented, by, slabgrave1, or, khovsgol, lba, and, xianbei, mogushan, ia, while, the, other, t, rk, remain, gd2, 4, displayed, an, admixed, profile, deriving, c, 48, 50, ancestry, from, ancient, northeast, asians, c, 47, ancestry, from, an, ancestry, maximised, in, han, chinese, represented, by, han, 2000bp, and, 3, 5, ancestry, from, a, west, eurasian, source, represented, by, sarmatians, the, gd2, 4, belonged, to, the, paternal, haplogroup, d, m174, the, authors, argue, that, these, findings, are, providing, a, new, piece, of, information, on, this, understudied, period, tokhara, yabghus, turk, shahis
