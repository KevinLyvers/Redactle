achievement, of, this, object, it, being, clearly, understood, that, nothing, shall, be, done, which, may, prejudice, the, civil, and, religious, rights, of, existing, non, jewish, communities, in, palestine, or, the, rights, and, political, status, enjoyed, by, jews, in, any, other, country, the, balfour, declaration, was, a, public, statement, issued, by, the, british, government, in, 1917, during, the, first, world, war, announcing, its, support, for, the, establishment, of, a, national, home, for, the, jewish, people, in, palestine, then, an, ottoman, region, with, a, small, minority, jewish, population, the, declaration, was, contained, in, a, letter, dated, 2, november, 1917, from, the, united, kingdom, s, foreign, secretary, arthur, balfour, to, lord, rothschild, a, leader, of, the, british, jewish, community, for, transmission, to, the, zionist, federation, of, great, britain, and, ireland, the, text, of, the, declaration, was, published, in, the, press, on, 9, november, 1917, immediately, following, britain, s, declaration, of, war, on, the, ottoman, empire, in, november, 1914, it, began, to, consider, the, future, of, palestine, within, two, months, a, memorandum, was, circulated, to, the, war, cabinet, by, a, zionist, member, herbert, samuel, proposing, the, support, of, zionist, ambitions, in, order, to, enlist, the, support, of, jews, in, the, wider, war, a, committee, was, established, in, april, 1915, by, british, prime, minister, h, h, asquith, to, determine, their, policy, towards, the, ottoman, empire, including, palestine, asquith, who, had, favoured, post, war, reform, of, the, ottoman, empire, resigned, in, december, 1916, his, replacement, david, lloyd, george, favoured, partition, of, the, empire, the, first, negotiations, between, the, british, and, the, zionists, took, place, at, a, conference, on, 7, february, 1917, that, included, sir, mark, sykes, and, the, zionist, leadership, subsequent, discussions, led, to, balfour, s, request, on, 19, june, that, rothschild, and, chaim, weizmann, submit, a, draft, of, a, public, declaration, further, drafts, were, discussed, by, the, british, cabinet, during, september, and, october, with, input, from, zionist, and, anti, zionist, jews, but, with, no, representation, from, the, local, population, in, palestine, by, late, 1917, in, the, lead, up, to, the, balfour, declaration, the, wider, war, had, reached, a, stalemate, with, two, of, britain, s, allies, not, fully, engaged, the, united, states, had, yet, to, suffer, a, casualty, and, the, russians, were, in, the, midst, of, a, revolution, with, bolsheviks, taking, over, the, government, a, stalemate, in, southern, palestine, was, broken, by, the, battle, of, beersheba, on, 31, october, 1917, the, release, of, the, final, declaration, was, authorised, on, 31, october, the, preceding, cabinet, discussion, had, referenced, perceived, propaganda, benefits, amongst, the, worldwide, jewish, community, for, the, allied, war, effort, the, opening, words, of, the, declaration, represented, the, first, public, expression, of, support, for, zionism, by, a, major, political, power, the, term, national, home, had, no, precedent, in, international, law, and, was, intentionally, vague, as, to, whether, a, jewish, state, was, contemplated, the, intended, boundaries, of, palestine, were, not, specified, and, the, british, government, later, confirmed, that, the, words, in, palestine, meant, that, the, jewish, national, home, was, not, intended, to, cover, all, of, palestine, the, second, half, of, the, declaration, was, added, to, satisfy, opponents, of, the, policy, who, had, claimed, that, it, would, otherwise, prejudice, the, position, of, the, local, population, of, palestine, and, encourage, antisemitism, worldwide, by, stamping, the, jews, as, strangers, in, their, native, lands, the, declaration, called, for, safeguarding, the, civil, and, religious, rights, for, the, palestinian, arabs, who, composed, the, vast, majority, of, the, local, population, and, also, the, rights, and, political, status, of, the, jewish, communities, in, other, countries, outside, of, palestine, the, british, government, acknowledged, in, 1939, that, the, local, population, s, wishes, and, interests, should, have, been, taken, into, account, and, recognised, in, 2017, that, the, declaration, should, have, called, for, the, protection, of, the, palestinian, arabs, political, rights, the, declaration, had, many, long, lasting, consequences, it, greatly, increased, popular, support, for, zionism, within, jewish, communities, worldwide, and, became, a, core, component, of, the, british, mandate, for, palestine, the, founding, document, of, mandatory, palestine, it, indirectly, led, to, the, emergence, of, the, state, of, israel, and, is, considered, a, principal, cause, of, the, ongoing, israeli, palestinian, conflict, often, described, as, the, world, s, most, intractable, controversy, remains, over, a, number, of, areas, such, as, whether, the, declaration, contradicted, earlier, promises, the, british, made, to, the, sharif, of, mecca, in, the, mcmahon, hussein, correspondence, early, british, political, support, for, an, increased, jewish, presence, in, the, region, of, palestine, was, based, upon, geopolitical, calculations, this, support, began, in, the, early, 1840s, and, was, led, by, lord, palmerston, following, the, occupation, of, syria, and, palestine, by, separatist, ottoman, governor, muhammad, ali, of, egypt, french, influence, had, grown, in, palestine, and, the, wider, middle, east, and, its, role, as, protector, of, the, catholic, communities, began, to, grow, just, as, russian, influence, had, grown, as, protector, of, the, eastern, orthodox, in, the, same, regions, this, left, britain, without, a, sphere, of, influence, and, thus, a, need, to, find, or, create, their, own, regional, prot, g, s, these, political, considerations, were, supported, by, a, sympathetic, evangelical, christian, sentiment, towards, the, restoration, of, the, jews, to, palestine, among, elements, of, the, mid, 19th, century, british, political, elite, most, notably, lord, shaftesbury, the, british, foreign, office, actively, encouraged, jewish, emigration, to, palestine, exemplified, by, charles, henry, churchill, s, 1841, 1842, exhortations, to, moses, montefiore, the, leader, of, the, british, jewish, community, such, efforts, were, premature, and, did, not, succeed, only, 24, 000, jews, were, living, in, palestine, on, the, eve, of, the, emergence, of, zionism, within, the, world, s, jewish, communities, in, the, last, two, decades, of, the, 19th, century, with, the, geopolitical, shakeup, occasioned, by, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, the, earlier, calculations, which, had, lapsed, for, some, time, led, to, a, renewal, of, strategic, assessments, and, political, bargaining, over, the, middle, and, far, east, although, other, factors, played, their, part, jonathan, schneer, says, that, stereotypical, thinking, by, british, officials, about, jews, also, played, a, role, in, the, decision, to, issue, the, declaration, robert, cecil, hugh, o, bierne, and, sir, mark, sykes, all, held, an, unrealistic, view, of, world, jewry, the, former, writing, i, do, not, think, it, is, possible, to, exaggerate, the, international, power, of, the, jews, zionist, representatives, saw, advantage, in, encouraging, such, views, james, renton, concurs, writing, that, the, british, foreign, policy, elite, including, prime, minister, david, lloyd, george, and, foreign, secretary, a, j, balfour, believed, that, jews, possessed, real, and, significant, power, that, could, be, of, use, to, them, in, the, war, zionism, arose, in, the, late, 19th, century, in, reaction, to, anti, semitic, and, exclusionary, nationalist, movements, in, europe, romantic, nationalism, in, central, and, eastern, europe, had, helped, to, set, off, the, haskalah, or, jewish, enlightenment, creating, a, split, in, the, jewish, community, between, those, who, saw, judaism, as, their, religion, and, those, who, saw, it, as, their, ethnicity, or, nation, the, 1881, 1884, anti, jewish, pogroms, in, the, russian, empire, encouraged, the, growth, of, the, latter, identity, resulting, in, the, formation, of, the, hovevei, zion, pioneer, organizations, the, publication, of, leon, pinsker, s, autoemancipation, and, the, first, major, wave, of, jewish, immigration, to, palestine, retrospectively, named, the, first, aliyah, in, 1896, theodor, herzl, a, jewish, journalist, living, in, austria, hungary, published, the, foundational, text, of, political, zionism, der, judenstaat, the, jews, state, or, the, state, of, the, jews, in, which, he, asserted, that, the, only, solution, to, the, jewish, question, in, europe, including, growing, anti, semitism, was, the, establishment, of, a, state, for, the, jews, a, year, later, herzl, founded, the, zionist, organization, which, at, its, first, congress, called, for, the, establishment, of, a, home, for, the, jewish, people, in, palestine, secured, under, public, law, proposed, measures, to, attain, that, goal, included, the, promotion, of, jewish, settlement, there, the, organisation, of, jews, in, the, diaspora, the, strengthening, of, jewish, feeling, and, consciousness, and, preparatory, steps, to, attain, necessary, governmental, grants, herzl, died, in, 1904, 44, years, before, the, establishment, of, state, of, israel, the, jewish, state, that, he, proposed, without, having, gained, the, political, standing, required, to, carry, out, his, agenda, zionist, leader, chaim, weizmann, later, president, of, the, world, zionist, organisation, and, first, president, of, israel, moved, from, switzerland, to, the, uk, in, 1904, and, met, arthur, balfour, who, had, just, launched, his, 1905, 1906, election, campaign, after, resigning, as, prime, minister, in, a, session, arranged, by, charles, dreyfus, his, jewish, constituency, representative, earlier, that, year, balfour, had, successfully, driven, the, aliens, act, through, parliament, with, impassioned, speeches, regarding, the, need, to, restrict, the, wave, of, immigration, into, britain, from, jews, fleeing, the, russian, empire, during, this, meeting, he, asked, what, weizmann, s, objections, had, been, to, the, 1903, uganda, scheme, that, herzl, had, supported, to, provide, a, portion, of, british, east, africa, to, the, jewish, people, as, a, homeland, the, scheme, which, had, been, proposed, to, herzl, by, joseph, chamberlain, colonial, secretary, in, balfour, s, cabinet, following, his, trip, to, east, africa, earlier, in, the, year, had, been, subsequently, voted, down, following, herzl, s, death, by, the, seventh, zionist, congress, in, 1905, after, two, years, of, heated, debate, in, the, zionist, organization, weizmann, responded, that, he, believed, the, english, are, to, london, as, the, jews, are, to, jerusalem, in, january, 1914, weizmann, first, met, baron, edmond, de, rothschild, a, member, of, the, french, branch, of, the, rothschild, family, and, a, leading, proponent, of, the, zionist, movement, in, relation, to, a, project, to, build, a, hebrew, university, in, jerusalem, the, baron, was, not, part, of, the, world, zionist, organization, but, had, funded, the, jewish, agricultural, colonies, of, the, first, aliyah, and, transferred, them, to, the, jewish, colonization, association, in, 1899, this, connection, was, to, bear, fruit, later, that, year, when, the, baron, s, son, james, de, rothschild, requested, a, meeting, with, weizmann, on, 25, november, 1914, to, enlist, him, in, influencing, those, deemed, to, be, receptive, within, the, british, government, to, their, agenda, of, a, jewish, state, in, palestine, through, james, s, wife, dorothy, weizmann, was, to, meet, r, zsika, rothschild, who, introduced, him, to, the, english, branch, of, the, family, in, particular, her, husband, charles, and, his, older, brother, walter, a, zoologist, and, former, member, of, parliament, mp, their, father, nathan, rothschild, 1st, baron, rothschild, head, of, the, english, branch, of, the, family, had, a, guarded, attitude, towards, zionism, but, he, died, in, march, 1915, and, his, title, was, inherited, by, walter, prior, to, the, declaration, about, 8, 000, of, britain, s, 300, 000, jews, belonged, to, a, zionist, organisation, globally, as, of, 1913, the, latest, known, date, prior, to, the, declaration, the, equivalent, figure, was, approximately, 1, the, year, 1916, marked, four, centuries, since, palestine, had, become, part, of, the, ottoman, empire, also, known, as, the, turkish, empire, for, most, of, this, period, the, jewish, population, represented, a, small, minority, approximately, 3, of, the, total, with, muslims, representing, the, largest, segment, of, the, population, and, christians, the, second, ottoman, government, in, constantinople, began, to, apply, restrictions, on, jewish, immigration, to, palestine, in, late, 1882, in, response, to, the, start, of, the, first, aliyah, earlier, that, year, although, this, immigration, was, creating, a, certain, amount, of, tension, with, the, local, population, mainly, among, the, merchant, and, notable, classes, in, 1901, the, sublime, porte, the, ottoman, central, government, gave, jews, the, same, rights, as, arabs, to, buy, land, in, palestine, and, the, percentage, of, jews, in, the, population, rose, to, 7, by, 1914, at, the, same, time, with, growing, distrust, of, the, young, turks, turkish, nationalists, who, had, taken, control, of, the, empire, in, 1908, and, the, second, aliyah, arab, nationalism, and, palestinian, nationalism, was, on, the, rise, and, in, palestine, anti, zionism, was, a, characteristic, that, unified, these, forces, historians, do, not, know, whether, these, strengthening, forces, would, still, have, ultimately, resulted, in, conflict, in, the, absence, of, the, balfour, declaration, in, july, 1914, war, broke, out, in, europe, between, the, triple, entente, britain, france, and, the, russian, empire, and, the, central, powers, germany, austria, hungary, and, later, that, year, the, ottoman, empire, the, british, cabinet, first, discussed, palestine, at, a, meeting, on, 9, november, 1914, four, days, after, britain, s, declaration, of, war, on, the, ottoman, empire, of, which, the, mutasarrifate, of, jerusalem, often, referred, to, as, palestine, was, a, component, at, the, meeting, david, lloyd, george, then, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, referred, to, the, ultimate, destiny, of, palestine, the, chancellor, whose, law, firm, lloyd, george, roberts, and, co, had, been, engaged, a, decade, before, by, the, zionist, federation, of, great, britain, and, ireland, to, work, on, the, uganda, scheme, was, to, become, prime, minister, by, the, time, of, the, declaration, and, was, ultimately, responsible, for, it, weizmann, s, political, efforts, picked, up, speed, and, on, 10, december, 1914, he, met, with, herbert, samuel, a, british, cabinet, member, and, a, secular, jew, who, had, studied, zionism, samuel, believed, weizmann, s, demands, were, too, modest, two, days, later, weizmann, met, balfour, again, for, the, first, time, since, their, initial, meeting, in, 1905, balfour, had, been, out, of, government, ever, since, his, electoral, defeat, in, 1906, but, remained, a, senior, member, of, the, conservative, party, in, their, role, as, official, opposition, a, month, later, samuel, circulated, a, memorandum, entitled, the, future, of, palestine, to, his, cabinet, colleagues, the, memorandum, stated, i, am, assured, that, the, solution, of, the, problem, of, palestine, which, would, be, much, the, most, welcome, to, the, leaders, and, supporters, of, the, zionist, movement, throughout, the, world, would, be, the, annexation, of, the, country, to, the, british, empire, samuel, discussed, a, copy, of, his, memorandum, with, nathan, rothschild, in, february, 1915, a, month, before, the, latter, s, death, it, was, the, first, time, in, an, official, record, that, enlisting, the, support, of, jews, as, a, war, measure, had, been, proposed, many, further, discussions, followed, including, the, initial, meetings, in, 1915, 16, between, lloyd, george, who, had, been, appointed, minister, of, munitions, in, may, 1915, and, weizmann, who, was, appointed, as, a, scientific, advisor, to, the, ministry, in, september, 1915, seventeen, years, later, in, his, war, memoirs, lloyd, george, described, these, meetings, as, being, the, fount, and, origin, of, the, declaration, historians, have, rejected, this, claim, in, late, 1915, the, british, high, commissioner, to, egypt, henry, mcmahon, exchanged, ten, letters, with, hussein, bin, ali, sharif, of, mecca, in, which, he, promised, hussein, to, recognize, arab, independence, in, the, limits, and, boundaries, proposed, by, the, sherif, of, mecca, in, return, for, hussein, launching, a, revolt, against, the, ottoman, empire, the, pledge, excluded, portions, of, syria, lying, to, the, west, of, the, districts, of, damascus, homs, hama, and, aleppo, in, the, decades, after, the, war, the, extent, of, this, coastal, exclusion, was, hotly, disputed, since, palestine, lay, to, the, southwest, of, damascus, and, was, not, explicitly, mentioned, the, arab, revolt, was, launched, on, june, 5th, 1916, on, the, basis, of, the, quid, pro, quo, agreement, in, the, correspondence, however, less, than, three, weeks, earlier, the, governments, of, the, united, kingdom, france, and, russia, secretly, concluded, the, sykes, picot, agreement, which, balfour, described, later, as, a, wholly, new, method, for, dividing, the, region, after, the, 1915, agreement, seems, to, have, been, forgotten, this, anglo, french, treaty, was, negotiated, in, late, 1915, and, early, 1916, between, sir, mark, sykes, and, fran, ois, georges, picot, with, the, primary, arrangements, being, set, out, in, draft, form, in, a, joint, memorandum, on, 5, january, 1916, sykes, was, a, british, conservative, mp, who, had, risen, to, a, position, of, significant, influence, on, britain, s, middle, east, policy, beginning, with, his, seat, on, the, 1915, de, bunsen, committee, and, his, initiative, to, create, the, arab, bureau, picot, was, a, french, diplomat, and, former, consul, general, in, beirut, their, agreement, defined, the, proposed, spheres, of, influence, and, control, in, western, asia, should, the, triple, entente, succeed, in, defeating, the, ottoman, empire, during, world, war, i, dividing, many, arab, territories, into, british, and, french, administered, areas, in, palestine, internationalisation, was, proposed, with, the, form, of, administration, to, be, confirmed, after, consultation, with, both, russia, and, hussein, the, january, draft, noted, christian, and, muslim, interests, and, that, members, of, the, jewish, community, throughout, the, world, have, a, conscientious, and, sentimental, interest, in, the, future, of, the, country, prior, to, this, point, no, active, negotiations, with, zionists, had, taken, place, but, sykes, had, been, aware, of, zionism, was, in, contact, with, moses, gaster, a, former, president, of, the, english, zionist, federation, and, may, have, seen, samuel, s, 1915, memorandum, on, 3, march, while, sykes, and, picot, were, still, in, petrograd, lucien, wolf, secretary, of, the, foreign, conjoint, committee, set, up, by, jewish, organizations, to, further, the, interests, of, foreign, jews, submitted, to, the, foreign, office, the, draft, of, an, assurance, formula, that, could, be, issued, by, the, allies, in, support, of, jewish, aspirations, in, the, event, of, palestine, coming, within, the, spheres, of, influence, of, great, britain, or, france, at, the, close, of, the, war, the, governments, of, those, powers, will, not, fail, to, take, account, of, the, historic, interest, that, country, possesses, for, the, jewish, community, the, jewish, population, will, be, secured, in, the, enjoyment, of, civil, and, religious, liberty, equal, political, rights, with, the, rest, of, the, population, reasonable, facilities, for, immigration, and, colonisation, and, such, municipal, privileges, in, the, towns, and, colonies, inhabited, by, them, as, may, be, shown, to, be, necessary, on, 11, march, telegrams, were, sent, in, grey, s, name, to, britain, s, russian, and, french, ambassadors, for, transmission, to, russian, and, french, authorities, including, the, formula, as, well, as, the, scheme, might, be, made, far, more, attractive, to, the, majority, of, jews, if, it, held, out, to, them, the, prospect, that, when, in, course, of, time, the, jewish, colonists, in, palestine, grow, strong, enough, to, cope, with, the, arab, population, they, may, be, allowed, to, take, the, management, of, the, internal, affairs, of, palestine, with, the, exception, of, jerusalem, and, the, holy, places, into, their, own, hands, sykes, having, seen, the, telegram, had, discussions, with, picot, and, proposed, making, reference, to, samuel, s, memorandum, the, creation, of, an, arab, sultanate, under, french, and, british, protection, some, means, of, administering, the, holy, places, along, with, the, establishment, of, a, company, to, purchase, land, for, jewish, colonists, who, would, then, become, citizens, with, equal, rights, to, arabs, shortly, after, returning, from, petrograd, sykes, briefed, samuel, who, then, briefed, a, meeting, of, gaster, weizmann, and, sokolow, gaster, recorded, in, his, diary, on, 16, april, 1916, we, are, offered, french, english, condominium, in, palest, arab, prince, to, conciliate, arab, sentiment, and, as, part, of, the, constitution, a, charter, to, zionists, for, which, england, would, stand, guarantee, and, which, would, stand, by, us, in, every, case, of, friction, it, practically, comes, to, a, complete, realisation, of, our, zionist, programme, however, we, insisted, on, national, character, of, charter, freedom, of, immigration, and, internal, autonomy, and, at, the, same, time, full, rights, of, citizenship, to, and, jews, in, palestine, in, sykes, mind, the, agreement, which, bore, his, name, was, outdated, even, before, it, was, signed, in, march, 1916, he, wrote, in, a, private, letter, to, my, mind, the, zionists, are, now, the, key, of, the, situation, in, the, event, neither, the, french, nor, the, russians, were, enthusiastic, about, the, proposed, formulation, and, eventually, on, 4, july, wolf, was, informed, that, the, present, moment, is, inopportune, for, making, any, announcement, these, wartime, initiatives, inclusive, of, the, declaration, are, frequently, considered, together, by, historians, because, of, the, potential, real, or, imagined, for, incompatibility, between, them, particularly, in, regard, to, the, disposition, of, palestine, in, the, words, of, professor, albert, hourani, founder, of, the, middle, east, centre, at, st, antony, s, college, oxford, the, argument, about, the, interpretation, of, these, agreements, is, one, which, is, impossible, to, end, because, they, were, intended, to, bear, more, than, one, interpretation, in, terms, of, british, politics, the, declaration, resulted, from, the, coming, into, power, of, lloyd, george, and, his, cabinet, which, had, replaced, the, h, h, asquith, led, cabinet, in, december, 1916, whilst, both, prime, ministers, were, liberals, and, both, governments, were, wartime, coalitions, lloyd, george, and, balfour, appointed, as, his, foreign, secretary, favoured, a, post, war, partition, of, the, ottoman, empire, as, a, major, british, war, aim, whereas, asquith, and, his, foreign, secretary, sir, edward, grey, had, favoured, its, reform, two, days, after, taking, office, lloyd, george, told, general, robertson, the, chief, of, the, imperial, general, staff, that, he, wanted, a, major, victory, preferably, the, capture, of, jerusalem, to, impress, british, public, opinion, and, immediately, consulted, his, war, cabinet, about, a, further, campaign, into, palestine, when, el, arish, had, been, secured, subsequent, pressure, from, lloyd, george, over, the, reservations, of, robertson, resulted, in, the, recapture, of, the, sinai, for, british, controlled, egypt, and, with, the, capture, of, el, arish, in, december, 1916, and, rafah, in, january, 1917, the, arrival, of, british, forces, at, the, southern, borders, of, the, ottoman, empire, following, two, unsuccessful, attempts, to, capture, gaza, between, 26, march, and, 19, april, a, six, month, stalemate, in, southern, palestine, began, the, sinai, and, palestine, campaign, would, not, make, any, progress, into, palestine, until, 31, october, 1917, following, the, change, in, government, sykes, was, promoted, into, the, war, cabinet, secretariat, with, responsibility, for, middle, eastern, affairs, in, january, 1917, despite, having, previously, built, a, relationship, with, moses, gaster, he, began, looking, to, meet, other, zionist, leaders, by, the, end, of, the, month, he, had, been, introduced, to, weizmann, and, his, associate, nahum, sokolow, a, journalist, and, executive, of, the, world, zionist, organization, who, had, moved, to, britain, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, on, 7, february, 1917, sykes, claiming, to, be, acting, in, a, private, capacity, entered, into, substantive, discussions, with, the, zionist, leadership, the, previous, british, correspondence, with, the, arabs, was, discussed, at, the, meeting, sokolow, s, notes, record, sykes, description, that, the, arabs, professed, that, language, must, be, the, measure, and, could, claim, all, syria, and, palestine, still, the, arabs, could, be, managed, particularly, if, they, received, jewish, support, in, other, matters, at, this, point, the, zionists, were, still, unaware, of, the, sykes, picot, agreement, although, they, had, their, suspicions, one, of, sykes, goals, was, the, mobilization, of, zionism, to, the, cause, of, british, suzerainty, in, palestine, so, as, to, have, arguments, to, put, to, france, in, support, of, that, objective, during, the, period, of, the, british, war, cabinet, discussions, leading, up, to, the, declaration, the, war, had, reached, a, period, of, stalemate, on, the, western, front, the, tide, would, first, turn, in, favour, of, the, central, powers, in, spring, 1918, before, decisively, turning, in, favour, of, the, allies, from, july, 1918, onwards, although, the, united, states, declared, war, on, germany, in, the, spring, of, 1917, it, did, not, suffer, its, first, casualties, until, 2, november, 1917, at, which, point, president, woodrow, wilson, still, hoped, to, avoid, dispatching, large, contingents, of, troops, into, the, war, the, russian, forces, were, known, to, be, distracted, by, the, ongoing, russian, revolution, and, the, growing, support, for, the, bolshevik, faction, but, alexander, kerensky, s, provisional, government, had, remained, in, the, war, russia, only, withdrew, after, the, final, stage, of, the, revolution, on, 7, november, 1917, balfour, met, weizmann, at, the, foreign, office, on, 22, march, 1917, two, days, later, weizmann, described, the, meeting, as, being, the, first, time, i, had, a, real, business, talk, with, him, weizmann, explained, at, the, meeting, that, the, zionists, had, a, preference, for, a, british, protectorate, over, palestine, as, opposed, to, an, american, french, or, international, arrangement, balfour, agreed, but, warned, that, there, may, be, difficulties, with, france, and, italy, the, french, position, in, regard, to, palestine, and, the, wider, syria, region, during, the, lead, up, to, the, balfour, declaration, was, largely, dictated, by, the, terms, of, the, sykes, picot, agreement, and, was, complicated, from, 23, november, 1915, by, increasing, french, awareness, of, the, british, discussions, with, the, sherif, of, mecca, prior, to, 1917, the, british, had, led, the, fighting, on, the, southern, border, of, the, ottoman, empire, alone, given, their, neighbouring, egyptian, colony, and, the, french, preoccupation, with, the, fighting, on, the, western, front, that, was, taking, place, on, their, own, soil, italy, s, participation, in, the, war, which, began, following, the, april, 1915, treaty, of, london, did, not, include, involvement, in, the, middle, eastern, sphere, until, the, april, 1917, agreement, of, saint, jean, de, maurienne, at, this, conference, lloyd, george, had, raised, the, question, of, a, british, protectorate, of, palestine, and, the, idea, had, been, very, coldly, received, by, the, french, and, the, italians, in, may, and, june, 1917, the, french, and, italians, sent, detachments, to, support, the, british, as, they, built, their, reinforcements, in, preparation, for, a, renewed, attack, on, palestine, in, early, april, sykes, and, picot, were, appointed, to, act, as, the, chief, negotiators, once, more, this, time, on, a, month, long, mission, to, the, middle, east, for, further, discussions, with, the, sherif, of, mecca, and, other, arab, leaders, on, 3, april, 1917, sykes, met, with, lloyd, george, lord, curzon, and, maurice, hankey, to, receive, his, instructions, in, this, regard, namely, to, keep, the, french, onside, while, not, prejudicing, the, zionist, movement, and, the, possibility, of, its, development, under, british, auspices, enter, into, any, political, pledges, to, the, arabs, and, particularly, none, in, regard, to, palestine, before, travelling, to, the, middle, east, picot, via, sykes, invited, nahum, sokolow, to, paris, to, educate, the, french, government, on, zionism, sykes, who, had, prepared, the, way, in, correspondence, with, picot, arrived, a, few, days, after, sokolow, in, the, meantime, sokolow, had, met, picot, and, other, french, officials, and, convinced, the, french, foreign, office, to, accept, for, study, a, statement, of, zionist, aims, in, regard, to, facilities, of, colonization, communal, autonomy, rights, of, language, and, establishment, of, a, jewish, chartered, company, sykes, went, on, ahead, to, italy, and, had, meetings, with, the, british, ambassador, and, british, vatican, representative, to, prepare, the, way, for, sokolow, once, again, sokolow, was, granted, an, audience, with, pope, benedict, xv, on, 6, may, 1917, sokolow, s, notes, of, the, meeting, the, only, meeting, records, known, to, historians, stated, that, the, pope, expressed, general, sympathy, and, support, for, the, zionist, project, on, 21, may, 1917, angelo, sereni, president, of, the, committee, of, the, jewish, communities, presented, sokolow, to, sidney, sonnino, the, italian, minister, of, foreign, affairs, he, was, also, received, by, paolo, boselli, the, italian, prime, minister, sonnino, arranged, for, the, secretary, general, of, the, ministry, to, send, a, letter, to, the, effect, that, although, he, could, not, express, himself, on, the, merits, of, a, program, which, concerned, all, the, allies, generally, speaking, he, was, not, opposed, to, the, legitimate, claims, of, the, jews, on, his, return, journey, sokolow, met, with, french, leaders, again, and, secured, a, letter, dated, 4, june, 1917, giving, assurances, of, sympathy, towards, the, zionist, cause, by, jules, cambon, head, of, the, political, section, of, the, french, foreign, ministry, this, letter, was, not, published, but, was, deposited, at, the, british, foreign, office, following, the, united, states, entry, into, the, war, on, 6, april, the, british, foreign, secretary, led, the, balfour, mission, to, washington, d, c, and, new, york, where, he, spent, a, month, between, mid, april, and, mid, may, during, the, trip, he, spent, significant, time, discussing, zionism, with, louis, brandeis, a, leading, zionist, and, a, close, ally, of, wilson, who, had, been, appointed, as, a, supreme, court, justice, a, year, previously, by, 13, june, 1917, it, was, acknowledged, by, ronald, graham, head, of, the, foreign, office, s, middle, eastern, affairs, department, that, the, three, most, relevant, politicians, the, prime, minister, the, foreign, secretary, and, the, parliamentary, under, secretary, of, state, for, foreign, affairs, lord, robert, cecil, were, all, in, favour, of, britain, supporting, the, zionist, movement, on, the, same, day, weizmann, had, written, to, graham, to, advocate, for, a, public, declaration, six, days, later, at, a, meeting, on, 19, june, balfour, asked, lord, rothschild, and, weizmann, to, submit, a, formula, for, a, declaration, over, the, next, few, weeks, a, 143, word, draft, was, prepared, by, the, zionist, negotiating, committee, but, it, was, considered, too, specific, on, sensitive, areas, by, sykes, graham, and, rothschild, separately, a, very, different, draft, had, been, prepared, by, the, foreign, office, described, in, 1961, by, harold, nicolson, who, had, been, involved, in, preparing, the, draft, as, proposing, a, sanctuary, for, jewish, victims, of, persecution, the, foreign, office, draft, was, strongly, opposed, by, the, zionists, and, was, discarded, no, copy, of, the, draft, has, been, found, in, the, foreign, office, archives, following, further, discussion, a, revised, and, at, just, 46, words, in, length, much, shorter, draft, declaration, was, prepared, and, sent, by, lord, rothschild, to, balfour, on, 18, july, it, was, received, by, the, foreign, office, and, the, matter, was, brought, to, the, cabinet, for, formal, consideration, the, decision, to, release, the, declaration, was, taken, by, the, british, war, cabinet, on, 31, october, 1917, this, followed, discussion, at, four, war, cabinet, meetings, including, the, 31, october, meeting, over, the, space, of, the, previous, two, months, in, order, to, aid, the, discussions, the, war, cabinet, secretariat, led, by, maurice, hankey, the, cabinet, secretary, and, supported, by, his, assistant, secretaries, primarily, sykes, and, his, fellow, conservative, mp, and, pro, zionist, leo, amery, solicited, outside, perspectives, to, put, before, the, cabinet, these, included, the, views, of, government, ministers, war, allies, notably, from, president, woodrow, wilson, and, in, october, formal, submissions, from, six, zionist, leaders, and, four, non, zionist, jews, british, officials, asked, president, wilson, for, his, consent, on, the, matter, on, two, occasions, first, on, 3, september, when, he, replied, the, time, was, not, ripe, and, later, on, 6, october, when, he, agreed, with, the, release, of, the, declaration, excerpts, from, the, minutes, of, these, four, war, cabinet, meetings, provide, a, description, of, the, primary, factors, that, the, ministers, considered, declassification, of, british, government, archives, has, allowed, scholars, to, piece, together, the, choreography, of, the, drafting, of, the, declaration, in, his, widely, cited, 1961, book, leonard, stein, published, four, previous, drafts, of, the, declaration, the, drafting, began, with, weizmann, s, guidance, to, the, zionist, drafting, team, on, its, objectives, in, a, letter, dated, 20, june, 1917, one, day, following, his, meeting, with, rothschild, and, balfour, he, proposed, that, the, declaration, from, the, british, government, should, state, its, conviction, its, desire, or, its, intention, to, support, zionist, aims, for, the, creation, of, a, jewish, national, home, in, palestine, no, reference, must, be, made, i, think, to, the, question, of, the, suzerain, power, because, that, would, land, the, british, into, difficulties, with, the, french, it, must, be, a, zionist, declaration, a, month, after, the, receipt, of, the, much, reduced, 12, july, draft, from, rothschild, balfour, proposed, a, number, of, mainly, technical, amendments, the, two, subsequent, drafts, included, much, more, substantial, amendments, the, first, in, a, late, august, draft, by, lord, milner, one, of, the, original, five, members, of, lloyd, george, s, war, cabinet, as, a, minister, without, portfolio, which, reduced, the, geographic, scope, from, all, of, palestine, to, in, palestine, and, the, second, from, milner, and, amery, in, early, october, which, added, the, two, safeguard, clauses, his, majesty, s, government, regards, as, essential, for, the, realization, of, this, principle, the, grant, of, internal, autonomy, to, the, jewish, nationality, in, palestine, freedom, of, immigration, for, jews, and, the, establishment, of, a, jewish, national, colonizing, corporation, for, the, resettlement, and, economic, development, of, the, country, the, conditions, and, forms, of, the, internal, autonomy, and, a, charter, for, the, jewish, national, colonizing, corporation, should, in, the, view, of, his, majesty, s, government, be, elaborated, in, detail, and, determined, with, the, representatives, of, the, zionist, organization, subsequent, authors, have, debated, who, the, primary, author, really, was, in, his, posthumously, published, 1981, book, the, anglo, american, establishment, georgetown, university, history, professor, carroll, quigley, explained, his, view, that, lord, milner, was, the, primary, author, of, the, declaration, and, more, recently, william, d, rubinstein, professor, of, modern, history, at, aberystwyth, university, wales, proposed, amery, instead, huneidi, wrote, that, ormsby, gore, in, a, report, he, prepared, for, shuckburgh, claimed, authorship, together, with, amery, of, the, final, draft, form, the, agreed, version, of, the, declaration, a, single, sentence, of, just, 67, words, was, sent, on, 2, november, 1917, in, a, short, letter, from, balfour, to, walter, rothschild, for, transmission, to, the, zionist, federation, of, great, britain, and, ireland, the, declaration, contained, four, clauses, of, which, the, first, two, promised, to, support, the, establishment, in, palestine, of, a, national, home, for, the, jewish, people, followed, by, two, safeguard, clauses, with, respect, to, the, civil, and, religious, rights, of, existing, non, jewish, communities, in, palestine, and, the, rights, and, political, status, enjoyed, by, jews, in, any, other, country, this, is, a, very, carefully, worded, document, and, but, for, the, somewhat, vague, phrase, a, national, home, for, the, jewish, people, might, be, considered, sufficiently, unalarming, but, the, vagueness, of, the, phrase, cited, has, been, a, cause, of, trouble, from, the, commencement, various, persons, in, high, positions, have, used, language, of, the, loosest, kind, calculated, to, convey, a, very, different, impression, to, the, more, moderate, interpretation, which, can, be, put, upon, the, words, president, wilson, brushed, away, all, doubts, as, to, what, was, intended, from, his, point, of, view, when, in, march, 1919, he, said, to, the, jewish, leaders, in, america, i, am, moreover, persuaded, that, the, allied, nations, with, the, fullest, concurrence, of, our, own, government, and, people, are, agreed, that, in, palestine, shall, be, laid, the, foundations, of, a, jewish, commonwealth, the, late, president, roosevelt, declared, that, one, of, the, allies, peace, conditions, should, be, that, palestine, must, be, made, a, jewish, state, mr, winston, churchill, has, spoken, of, a, jewish, state, and, mr, bonar, law, has, talked, in, parliament, of, restoring, palestine, to, the, jews, report, of, the, palin, commission, august, 1920, the, term, national, home, was, intentionally, ambiguous, having, no, legal, value, or, precedent, in, international, law, such, that, its, meaning, was, unclear, when, compared, to, other, terms, such, as, state, the, term, was, intentionally, used, instead, of, state, because, of, opposition, to, the, zionist, program, within, the, british, cabinet, according, to, historian, norman, rose, the, chief, architects, of, the, declaration, contemplated, that, a, jewish, state, would, emerge, in, time, while, the, palestine, royal, commission, concluded, that, the, wording, was, the, outcome, of, a, compromise, between, those, ministers, who, contemplated, the, ultimate, establishment, of, a, jewish, state, and, those, who, did, not, interpretation, of, the, wording, has, been, sought, in, the, correspondence, leading, to, the, final, version, of, the, declaration, an, official, report, to, the, war, cabinet, sent, by, sykes, on, 22, september, said, that, the, zionists, did, not, want, to, set, up, a, jewish, republic, or, any, other, form, of, state, in, palestine, or, in, any, part, of, palestine, but, rather, preferred, some, form, of, protectorate, as, provided, in, the, palestine, mandate, a, month, later, curzon, produced, a, memorandum, circulated, on, 26, october, 1917, where, he, addressed, two, questions, the, first, concerning, the, meaning, of, the, phrase, a, national, home, for, the, jewish, race, in, palestine, he, noted, that, there, were, different, opinions, ranging, from, a, fully, fledged, state, to, a, merely, spiritual, centre, for, the, jews, sections, of, the, british, press, assumed, that, a, jewish, state, was, intended, even, before, the, declaration, was, finalized, in, the, united, states, the, press, began, using, the, terms, jewish, national, home, jewish, state, jewish, republic, and, jewish, commonwealth, interchangeably, treaty, expert, david, hunter, miller, who, was, at, the, conference, and, subsequently, compiled, a, 22, volume, compendium, of, documents, provides, a, report, of, the, intelligence, section, of, the, american, delegation, to, the, paris, peace, conference, of, 1919, which, recommended, that, there, be, established, a, separate, state, in, palestine, and, that, it, will, be, the, policy, of, the, league, of, nations, to, recognize, palestine, as, a, jewish, state, as, soon, as, it, is, a, jewish, state, in, fact, the, report, further, advised, that, an, independent, palestinian, state, under, a, british, league, of, nations, mandate, be, created, jewish, settlement, would, be, allowed, and, encouraged, in, this, state, and, this, state, s, holy, sites, would, be, under, the, control, of, the, league, of, nations, indeed, the, inquiry, spoke, positively, about, the, possibility, of, a, jewish, state, eventually, being, created, in, palestine, if, the, necessary, demographics, for, this, were, to, exist, historian, matthew, jacobs, later, wrote, that, the, us, approach, was, hampered, by, the, general, absence, of, specialist, knowledge, about, the, region, and, that, like, much, of, the, inquiry, s, work, on, the, middle, east, the, reports, on, palestine, were, deeply, flawed, and, presupposed, a, particular, outcome, of, the, conflict, he, quotes, miller, writing, about, one, report, on, the, history, and, impact, of, zionism, absolutely, inadequate, from, any, standpoint, and, must, be, regarded, as, nothing, more, than, material, for, a, future, report, lord, robert, cecil, on, 2, december, 1917, assured, an, audience, that, the, government, fully, intended, that, judea, for, the, jews, yair, auron, opines, that, cecil, then, a, deputy, foreign, secretary, representing, the, british, government, at, a, celebratory, gathering, of, the, english, zionist, federation, possibly, went, beyond, his, official, brief, in, saying, he, cites, stein, our, wish, is, that, arabian, countries, shall, be, for, the, arabs, armenia, for, the, armenians, and, judaea, for, the, jews, the, following, october, neville, chamberlain, while, chairing, a, zionist, meeting, discussed, a, new, jewish, state, at, the, time, chamberlain, was, a, member, of, parliament, for, ladywood, birmingham, recalling, the, event, in, 1939, just, after, chamberlain, had, approved, the, 1939, white, paper, the, jewish, telegraph, agency, noted, that, the, prime, minister, had, experienced, a, pronounced, change, of, mind, in, the, 21, years, intervening, a, year, later, on, the, declaration, s, second, anniversary, general, jan, smuts, said, that, britain, would, redeem, her, pledge, and, a, great, jewish, state, would, ultimately, rise, in, similar, vein, churchill, a, few, months, later, stated, if, as, may, well, happen, there, should, be, created, in, our, own, lifetime, by, the, banks, of, the, jordan, a, jewish, state, under, the, protection, of, the, british, crown, which, might, comprise, three, or, four, millions, of, jews, an, event, will, have, occurred, in, the, history, of, the, world, which, would, from, every, point, of, view, be, beneficial, at, the, 22, june, 1921, meeting, of, the, imperial, cabinet, churchill, was, asked, by, arthur, meighen, the, canadian, prime, minister, about, the, meaning, of, the, national, home, churchill, said, if, in, the, course, of, many, years, they, become, a, majority, in, the, country, they, naturally, would, take, it, over, pro, rata, with, the, arab, we, made, an, equal, pledge, that, we, would, not, turn, the, arab, off, his, land, or, invade, his, political, and, social, rights, responding, to, curzon, in, january, 1919, balfour, wrote, weizmann, has, never, put, forward, a, claim, for, the, jewish, government, of, palestine, such, a, claim, in, my, opinion, is, clearly, inadmissible, and, personally, i, do, not, think, we, should, go, further, than, the, original, declaration, which, i, made, to, lord, rothschild, in, february, 1919, france, issued, a, statement, that, it, would, not, oppose, putting, palestine, under, british, trusteeship, and, the, formation, of, a, jewish, state, friedman, further, notes, that, france, s, attitude, went, on, to, change, yehuda, blum, while, discussing, france, s, unfriendly, attitude, towards, the, jewish, national, movement, notes, the, content, of, a, report, made, by, robert, vansittart, a, leading, member, of, the, british, delegation, to, the, paris, peace, conference, to, curzon, in, november, 1920, which, said, had, agreed, to, a, jewish, national, home, not, a, jewish, state, they, considered, we, were, steering, straight, upon, the, latter, and, the, very, last, thing, they, would, do, was, to, enlarge, that, state, for, they, totally, disapproved, our, policy, greece, s, foreign, minister, told, the, editor, of, the, salonica, jewish, organ, pro, israel, that, the, establishment, of, a, jewish, state, meets, in, greece, with, full, and, sincere, sympathy, a, jewish, palestine, would, become, an, ally, of, greece, in, switzerland, a, number, of, noted, historians, including, professors, tobler, forel, yvorne, and, rogaz, supported, the, idea, of, establishing, a, jewish, state, with, one, referring, to, it, as, a, sacred, right, of, the, jews, while, in, germany, officials, and, most, of, the, press, took, the, declaration, to, mean, a, british, sponsored, state, for, the, jews, the, british, government, including, churchill, made, it, clear, that, the, declaration, did, not, intend, for, the, whole, of, palestine, to, be, converted, into, a, jewish, national, home, but, that, such, a, home, should, be, founded, in, palestine, emir, faisal, king, of, syria, and, iraq, made, a, formal, written, agreement, with, zionist, leader, chaim, weizmann, which, was, drafted, by, t, e, lawrence, whereby, they, would, try, to, establish, a, peaceful, relationship, between, arabs, and, jews, in, palestine, the, 3, january, 1919, faisal, weizmann, agreement, was, a, short, lived, agreement, for, arab, jewish, cooperation, on, the, development, of, a, jewish, homeland, in, palestine, faisal, did, treat, palestine, differently, in, his, presentation, to, the, peace, conference, on, 6, february, 1919, saying, palestine, for, its, universal, character, left, on, one, side, for, the, mutual, consideration, of, all, parties, concerned, the, agreement, was, never, implemented, in, a, subsequent, letter, written, in, english, by, lawrence, for, faisal, s, signature, he, explained, we, feel, that, the, arabs, and, jews, are, cousins, in, race, suffering, similar, oppression, at, the, hands, of, powers, stronger, than, themselves, and, by, a, happy, coincidence, have, been, able, to, take, the, first, step, toward, the, attainment, of, their, national, ideals, together, we, arabs, especially, the, educated, among, us, look, with, deepest, sympathy, on, the, zionist, movement, we, will, do, our, best, in, so, far, as, we, are, concerned, to, help, them, through, we, will, wish, the, jews, a, most, hearty, welcome, home, when, the, letter, was, tabled, at, the, shaw, commission, in, 1929, rustam, haidar, spoke, to, faisal, in, baghdad, and, cabled, that, faisal, had, no, recollection, that, he, wrote, anything, of, the, sort, in, january, 1930, haidar, wrote, to, a, newspaper, in, baghdad, that, faisal, finds, it, exceedingly, strange, that, such, a, matter, is, attributed, to, him, as, he, at, no, time, would, consider, allowing, any, foreign, nation, to, share, in, an, arab, country, awni, abd, al, hadi, faisal, s, secretary, wrote, in, his, memoirs, that, he, was, not, aware, that, a, meeting, between, frankfurter, and, faisal, took, place, and, that, i, believe, that, this, letter, assuming, that, it, is, authentic, was, written, by, lawrence, and, that, lawrence, signed, it, in, english, on, behalf, of, faisal, i, believe, this, letter, is, part, of, the, false, claims, made, by, chaim, weizmann, and, lawrence, to, lead, astray, public, opinion, according, to, allawi, the, most, likely, explanation, for, the, frankfurter, letter, is, that, a, meeting, took, place, a, letter, was, drafted, in, english, by, lawrence, but, that, its, contents, were, not, entirely, made, clear, to, faisal, he, then, may, or, may, not, have, been, induced, to, sign, it, since, it, ran, counter, to, faisal, s, other, public, and, private, statements, at, the, time, a, 1, march, interview, by, le, matin, quoted, faisal, as, saying, this, feeling, of, respect, for, other, religions, dictates, my, opinion, about, palestine, our, neighbor, that, the, unhappy, jews, come, to, reside, there, and, behave, as, good, citizens, of, this, country, our, humanity, rejoices, given, that, they, are, placed, under, a, muslim, or, christian, government, mandated, by, the, league, of, nations, if, they, want, to, constitute, a, state, and, claim, sovereign, rights, in, this, region, i, foresee, very, serious, dangers, it, is, to, be, feared, that, there, will, be, a, conflict, between, them, and, the, other, races, referring, to, his, 1922, white, paper, churchill, later, wrote, that, there, is, nothing, in, it, to, prohibit, the, ultimate, establishment, of, a, jewish, state, and, in, private, many, british, officials, agreed, with, the, zionists, interpretation, that, a, state, would, be, established, when, a, jewish, majority, was, achieved, when, chaim, weizmann, met, with, churchill, lloyd, george, and, balfour, at, balfour, s, home, in, london, on, 21, july, 1921, lloyd, george, and, balfour, assured, weizmann, that, by, the, declaration, they, had, always, meant, an, eventual, jewish, state, according, to, weizmann, minutes, of, that, meeting, lloyd, george, stated, in, 1937, that, it, was, intended, that, palestine, would, become, a, jewish, commonwealth, if, and, when, jews, had, become, a, definite, majority, of, the, inhabitants, and, leo, amery, echoed, the, same, position, in, 1946, in, the, unscop, report, of, 1947, the, issue, of, home, versus, state, was, subjected, to, scrutiny, arriving, at, a, similar, conclusion, to, that, of, lloyd, george, the, statement, that, such, a, homeland, would, be, found, in, palestine, rather, than, of, palestine, was, also, deliberate, the, proposed, draft, of, the, declaration, contained, in, rothschild, s, 12, july, letter, to, balfour, referred, to, the, principle, that, palestine, should, be, reconstituted, as, the, national, home, of, the, jewish, people, in, the, final, text, following, lord, milner, s, amendment, the, word, reconstituted, was, removed, and, the, word, that, was, replaced, with, in, this, text, thereby, avoided, committing, the, entirety, of, palestine, as, the, national, home, of, the, jewish, people, resulting, in, controversy, in, future, years, over, the, intended, scope, especially, the, revisionist, zionism, sector, which, claimed, entirety, of, mandatory, palestine, and, emirate, of, transjordan, as, jewish, homeland, this, was, clarified, by, the, 1922, churchill, white, paper, which, wrote, that, the, terms, of, the, declaration, referred, to, do, not, contemplate, that, palestine, as, a, whole, should, be, converted, into, a, jewish, national, home, but, that, such, a, home, should, be, founded, in, palestine, the, declaration, did, not, include, any, geographical, boundaries, for, palestine, following, the, end, of, the, war, three, documents, the, declaration, the, hussein, mcmahon, correspondence, and, the, sykes, picot, agreement, became, the, basis, for, the, negotiations, to, set, the, boundaries, of, palestine, if, however, the, strict, terms, of, the, balfour, statement, are, adhered, to, it, can, hardly, be, doubted, that, the, extreme, zionist, program, must, be, greatly, modified, for, a, national, home, for, the, jewish, people, is, not, equivalent, to, making, palestine, into, a, jewish, state, nor, can, the, erection, of, such, a, jewish, state, be, accomplished, without, the, gravest, trespass, upon, the, civil, and, religious, rights, of, existing, non, jewish, communities, in, palestine, the, fact, came, out, repeatedly, in, the, commission, s, conference, with, jewish, representatives, that, the, zionists, looked, forward, to, a, practically, complete, dispossession, of, the, present, non, jewish, inhabitants, of, palestine, by, various, forms, of, purchase, report, of, the, king, crane, commission, august, 1919, the, declaration, s, first, safeguard, clause, referred, to, protecting, the, civil, and, religious, rights, of, non, jews, in, palestine, the, clause, had, been, drafted, together, with, the, second, safeguard, by, leo, amery, in, consultation, with, lord, milner, with, the, intention, to, go, a, reasonable, distance, to, meeting, the, objectors, both, jewish, and, pro, arab, without, impairing, the, substance, of, the, proposed, declaration, arabs, constituted, around, 90, of, the, population, of, palestine, but, as, stated, by, ronald, storrs, britain, s, military, governor, of, jerusalem, between, 1917, and, 1920, they, were, not, so, much, lumped, together, under, the, negative, and, humiliating, definition, of, non, jewish, communities, additionally, there, was, no, reference, to, protecting, the, political, rights, of, this, group, as, there, was, regarding, jews, in, other, countries, this, lack, of, interest, was, frequently, contrasted, against, the, commitment, to, the, jewish, community, with, various, terms, used, over, subsequent, years, to, regard, the, two, obligations, as, linked, a, heated, question, was, whether, the, status, of, both, groups, had, equal, weight, which, the, british, government, and, the, permanent, mandates, commission, held, to, be, the, case, in, the, 1930, passfield, white, paper, balfour, stated, in, february, 1919, that, palestine, was, considered, an, exceptional, case, in, which, referring, to, the, local, population, we, deliberately, and, rightly, decline, to, accept, the, principle, of, self, determination, although, he, considered, that, the, policy, provided, self, determination, to, jews, avi, shlaim, considers, this, the, declaration, s, greatest, contradiction, this, principle, of, self, determination, had, been, declared, on, numerous, occasions, subsequent, to, the, declaration, president, wilson, s, january, 1918, fourteen, points, mcmahon, s, declaration, to, the, seven, in, june, 1918, the, november, 1918, anglo, french, declaration, and, the, june, 1919, covenant, of, the, league, of, nations, that, had, established, the, mandate, system, in, an, august, 1919, memo, balfour, acknowledged, the, inconsistency, among, these, statements, and, further, explained, that, the, british, had, no, intention, of, consulting, the, existing, population, of, palestine, the, results, of, the, ongoing, american, king, crane, commission, of, enquiry, consultation, of, the, local, population, from, which, the, british, had, withdrawn, were, suppressed, for, three, years, until, the, report, was, leaked, in, 1922, subsequent, british, governments, have, acknowledged, this, deficiency, in, particular, the, 1939, committee, led, by, the, lord, chancellor, frederic, maugham, which, concluded, that, the, government, had, not, been, free, to, dispose, of, palestine, without, regard, for, the, wishes, and, interests, of, the, inhabitants, of, palestine, and, the, april, 2017, statement, by, british, foreign, office, minister, of, state, baroness, anelay, that, the, government, acknowledged, that, the, declaration, should, have, called, for, the, protection, of, political, rights, of, the, non, jewish, communities, in, palestine, particularly, their, right, to, self, determination, the, second, safeguard, clause, was, a, commitment, that, nothing, should, be, done, which, might, prejudice, the, rights, of, the, jewish, communities, in, other, countries, outside, of, palestine, the, original, drafts, of, rothschild, balfour, and, milner, did, not, include, this, safeguard, which, was, drafted, together, with, the, preceding, safeguard, in, early, october, in, order, to, reflect, opposition, from, influential, members, of, the, anglo, jewish, community, lord, rothschild, took, exception, to, the, proviso, on, the, basis, that, it, presupposed, the, possibility, of, a, danger, to, non, zionists, which, he, denied, the, conjoint, foreign, committee, of, the, board, of, deputies, of, british, jews, and, the, anglo, jewish, association, had, published, a, letter, in, the, times, on, 24, may, 1917, entitled, views, of, anglo, jewry, signed, by, the, two, organisations, presidents, david, lindo, alexander, and, claude, montefiore, stating, their, view, that, the, establishment, of, a, jewish, nationality, in, palestine, founded, on, this, theory, of, homelessness, must, have, the, effect, throughout, the, world, of, stamping, the, jews, as, strangers, in, their, native, lands, and, of, undermining, their, hard, won, position, as, citizens, and, nationals, of, these, lands, this, was, followed, in, late, august, by, edwin, montagu, an, influential, anti, zionist, jew, and, secretary, of, state, for, india, and, the, only, jewish, member, of, the, british, cabinet, who, wrote, in, a, cabinet, memorandum, that, the, policy, of, his, majesty, s, government, is, anti, semitic, in, result, and, will, prove, a, rallying, ground, for, anti, semites, in, every, country, of, the, world, the, text, of, the, declaration, was, published, in, the, press, one, week, after, it, was, signed, on, 9, november, 1917, other, related, events, took, place, within, a, short, timeframe, the, two, most, relevant, being, the, almost, immediate, british, military, capture, of, palestine, and, the, leaking, of, the, previously, secret, sykes, picot, agreement, on, the, military, side, both, gaza, and, jaffa, fell, within, several, days, and, jerusalem, was, surrendered, to, the, british, on, 9, december, the, publication, of, the, sykes, picot, agreement, following, the, russian, revolution, in, the, bolshevik, izvestia, and, pravda, on, 23, november, 1917, and, in, the, british, manchester, guardian, on, 26, november, 1917, represented, a, dramatic, moment, for, the, allies, eastern, campaign, the, british, were, embarrassed, the, arabs, dismayed, and, the, turks, delighted, the, zionists, had, been, aware, of, the, outlines, of, the, agreement, since, april, and, specifically, the, part, relevant, to, palestine, following, a, meeting, between, weizmann, and, cecil, where, weizmann, made, very, clear, his, objections, to, the, proposed, scheme, the, declaration, represented, the, first, public, support, for, zionism, by, a, major, political, power, its, publication, galvanized, zionism, which, finally, had, obtained, an, official, charter, in, addition, to, its, publication, in, major, newspapers, leaflets, were, circulated, throughout, jewish, communities, these, leaflets, were, airdropped, over, jewish, communities, in, germany, and, austria, as, well, as, the, pale, of, settlement, which, had, been, given, to, the, central, powers, following, the, russian, withdrawal, weizmann, had, argued, that, the, declaration, would, have, three, effects, it, would, swing, russia, to, maintain, pressure, on, germany, s, eastern, front, since, jews, had, been, prominent, in, the, march, revolution, of, 1917, it, would, rally, the, large, jewish, community, in, the, united, states, to, press, for, greater, funding, for, the, american, war, effort, underway, since, april, of, that, year, and, lastly, that, it, would, undermine, german, jewish, support, for, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, the, declaration, spurred, an, unintended, and, extraordinary, increase, in, the, number, of, adherents, of, american, zionism, in, 1914, the, 200, american, zionist, societies, comprised, a, total, of, 7, 500, members, which, grew, to, 30, 000, members, in, 600, societies, in, 1918, and, 149, 000, members, in, 1919, whilst, the, british, had, considered, that, the, declaration, reflected, a, previously, established, dominance, of, the, zionist, position, in, jewish, thought, it, was, the, declaration, itself, that, was, subsequently, responsible, for, zionism, s, legitimacy, and, leadership, exactly, one, month, after, the, declaration, was, issued, a, large, scale, celebration, took, place, at, the, royal, opera, house, speeches, were, given, by, leading, zionists, as, well, as, members, of, the, british, administration, including, sykes, and, cecil, from, 1918, until, the, second, world, war, jews, in, mandatory, palestine, celebrated, balfour, day, as, an, annual, national, holiday, on, 2, november, the, celebrations, included, ceremonies, in, schools, and, other, public, institutions, and, festive, articles, in, the, hebrew, press, in, august, 1919, balfour, approved, weizmann, s, request, to, name, the, first, post, war, settlement, in, mandatory, palestine, balfouria, in, his, honour, it, was, intended, to, be, a, model, settlement, for, future, american, jewish, activity, in, palestine, herbert, samuel, the, zionist, mp, whose, 1915, memorandum, had, framed, the, start, of, discussions, in, the, british, cabinet, was, asked, by, lloyd, george, on, 24, april, 1920, to, act, as, the, first, civil, governor, of, british, palestine, replacing, the, previous, military, administration, that, had, ruled, the, area, since, the, war, shortly, after, beginning, the, role, in, july, 1920, he, was, invited, to, read, the, haftarah, from, isaiah, 40, at, the, hurva, synagogue, in, jerusalem, which, according, to, his, memoirs, led, the, congregation, of, older, settlers, to, feel, that, the, fulfilment, of, ancient, prophecy, might, at, last, be, at, hand, the, local, christian, and, muslim, community, of, palestine, who, constituted, almost, 90, of, the, population, strongly, opposed, the, declaration, as, described, by, the, palestinian, american, philosopher, edward, said, in, 1979, it, was, perceived, as, being, made, a, by, a, european, power, b, about, a, non, european, territory, c, in, a, flat, disregard, of, both, the, presence, and, the, wishes, of, the, native, majority, resident, in, that, territory, and, d, it, took, the, form, of, a, promise, about, this, same, territory, to, another, foreign, group, according, to, the, 1919, king, crane, commission, no, british, officer, consulted, by, the, commissioners, believed, that, the, zionist, programme, could, be, carried, out, except, by, force, of, arms, a, delegation, of, the, muslim, christian, association, headed, by, musa, al, husayni, expressed, public, disapproval, on, 3, november, 1918, one, day, after, the, zionist, commission, parade, marking, the, first, anniversary, of, the, balfour, declaration, they, handed, a, petition, signed, by, more, than, 100, notables, to, ronald, storrs, the, british, military, governor, we, have, noticed, yesterday, a, large, crowd, of, jews, carrying, banners, and, over, running, the, streets, shouting, words, which, hurt, the, feeling, and, wound, the, soul, they, pretend, with, open, voice, that, palestine, which, is, the, holy, land, of, our, fathers, and, the, graveyard, of, our, ancestors, which, has, been, inhabited, by, the, arabs, for, long, ages, who, loved, it, and, died, in, defending, it, is, now, a, national, home, for, them, we, arabs, muslim, and, christian, have, always, sympathized, profoundly, with, the, persecuted, jews, and, their, misfortunes, in, other, countries, but, there, is, wide, difference, between, such, sympathy, and, the, acceptance, of, such, a, nation, ruling, over, us, and, disposing, of, our, affairs, the, group, also, protested, the, carrying, of, new, white, and, blue, banners, with, two, inverted, triangles, in, the, middle, drawing, the, attention, of, the, british, authorities, to, the, serious, consequences, of, any, political, implications, in, raising, the, banners, later, that, month, on, the, first, anniversary, of, the, occupation, of, jaffa, by, the, british, the, muslim, christian, association, sent, a, lengthy, memorandum, and, petition, to, the, military, governor, protesting, once, more, any, formation, of, a, jewish, state, the, majority, of, britain, s, military, leaders, considered, balfour, s, declaration, either, a, mistake, or, one, that, presented, grave, risks, in, the, broader, arab, world, the, declaration, was, seen, as, a, betrayal, of, the, british, wartime, understandings, with, the, arabs, the, sharif, of, mecca, and, other, arab, leaders, considered, the, declaration, a, violation, of, a, previous, commitment, made, in, the, mcmahon, hussein, correspondence, in, exchange, for, launching, the, arab, revolt, following, the, publication, of, the, declaration, in, an, egyptian, newspaper, al, muqattam, the, british, dispatched, commander, david, george, hogarth, to, see, hussein, in, january, 1918, bearing, the, message, that, the, political, and, economic, freedom, of, the, palestinian, population, was, not, in, question, hogarth, reported, that, hussein, would, not, accept, an, independent, jewish, state, in, palestine, nor, was, i, instructed, to, warn, him, that, such, a, state, was, contemplated, by, great, britain, hussein, had, also, learned, of, the, sykes, picot, agreement, when, it, was, leaked, by, the, new, soviet, government, in, december, 1917, but, was, satisfied, by, two, disingenuous, messages, from, sir, reginald, wingate, who, had, replaced, mcmahon, as, high, commissioner, of, egypt, assuring, him, that, the, british, commitments, to, the, arabs, were, still, valid, and, that, the, sykes, picot, agreement, was, not, a, formal, treaty, continuing, arab, disquiet, over, allied, intentions, also, led, during, 1918, to, the, british, declaration, to, the, seven, and, the, anglo, french, declaration, the, latter, promising, the, complete, and, final, liberation, of, the, peoples, who, have, for, so, long, been, oppressed, by, the, turks, and, the, setting, up, of, national, governments, and, administrations, deriving, their, authority, from, the, free, exercise, of, the, initiative, and, choice, of, the, indigenous, populations, in, 1919, king, hussein, refused, to, ratify, the, treaty, of, versailles, after, february, 1920, the, british, ceased, to, pay, subsidy, to, him, in, august, 1920, five, days, after, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, s, vres, which, formally, recognized, the, kingdom, of, hejaz, curzon, asked, cairo, to, procure, hussein, s, signature, to, both, treaties, and, agreed, to, make, a, payment, of, 30, 000, conditional, on, signature, hussein, declined, and, in, 1921, stated, that, he, could, not, be, expected, to, affix, his, name, to, a, document, assigning, palestine, to, the, zionists, and, syria, to, foreigners, following, the, 1921, cairo, conference, lawrence, was, sent, to, try, and, obtain, the, king, s, signature, to, a, treaty, as, well, as, to, versailles, and, s, vres, a, 60, 000, annual, subsidy, being, proposed, this, attempt, also, failed, during, 1923, the, british, made, one, further, attempt, to, settle, outstanding, issues, with, hussein, and, once, again, the, attempt, foundered, hussein, continued, in, his, refusal, to, recognize, the, balfour, declaration, or, any, of, the, mandates, that, he, perceived, as, being, his, domain, in, march, 1924, having, briefly, considered, the, possibility, of, removing, the, offending, article, from, the, treaty, the, government, suspended, any, further, negotiations, within, six, months, they, withdrew, their, support, in, favour, of, their, central, arabian, ally, ibn, saud, who, proceeded, to, conquer, hussein, s, kingdom, the, declaration, was, first, endorsed, by, a, foreign, government, on, 27, december, 1917, when, serbian, zionist, leader, and, diplomat, david, albala, announced, the, support, of, serbia, s, government, in, exile, during, a, mission, to, the, united, states, the, french, and, italian, governments, offered, their, endorsements, on, 14, february, and, 9, may, 1918, respectively, at, a, private, meeting, in, london, on, 1, december, 1918, lloyd, george, and, french, prime, minister, georges, clemenceau, agreed, to, certain, modifications, to, the, sykes, picot, agreement, including, british, control, of, palestine, on, 25, april, 1920, the, san, remo, conference, an, outgrowth, of, the, paris, peace, conference, attended, by, the, prime, ministers, of, britain, france, and, italy, the, japanese, ambassador, to, france, and, the, united, states, ambassador, to, italy, established,

cast, of, the, palestinian, mandate, and, objected, especially, to, language, that, did, not, safeguard, the, political, rights, of, non, jews, accepting, curzon, s, claim, that, in, the, british, language, all, ordinary, rights, were, included, in, civil, rights, at, the, request, of, france, it, was, agreed, that, an, undertaking, was, to, be, inserted, in, the, mandate, s, proc, s, verbal, that, this, would, not, involve, the, surrender, of, the, rights, hitherto, enjoyed, by, the, non, jewish, communities, in, palestine, the, italian, endorsement, of, the, declaration, had, included, the, condition, on, the, understanding, that, there, is, no, prejudice, against, the, legal, and, political, status, of, the, already, existing, religious, communities, the, boundaries, of, palestine, were, left, unspecified, to, be, determined, by, the, principal, allied, powers, three, months, later, in, july, 1920, the, french, defeat, of, faisal, s, arab, kingdom, of, syria, precipitated, the, british, need, to, know, what, is, the, syria, for, which, the, french, received, a, mandate, at, san, remo, and, does, it, include, transjordania, it, subsequently, decided, to, pursue, a, policy, of, associating, transjordan, with, the, mandated, area, of, palestine, without, adding, it, to, the, area, of, the, jewish, national, home, in, 1922, congress, officially, endorsed, america, s,

chester, university, whose, research, focuses, on, american, relations, with, the, middle, east, argues, that, president, wilson, and, congress, ignored, democratic, values, in, favour, of, biblical, romanticism, when, they, endorsed, the, declaration, he, points, to, an, organized, pro, zionist, lobby, in, the, united, states, which, was, active, at, a, time, when, the, country, s, small, arab, american, community, had, little, political, power, the, publication, of, the, balfour, declaration, was, met, with, tactical, responses, from, the, central, powers, however, the, participation, of, the, ottoman, empire, in, the, alliance, meant, that, germany, was, unable, to, effectively, counter, the, british, pronouncement, two, weeks, following, the, declaration, ottokar, czernin, the, austrian, foreign, minister, gave, an, interview, to, arthur, hantke, president, of, the, zionist, federation, of, germany, promising, that, his, government, would, influence, the, turks, once, the,

subsequently, released, in, the, german, jewish, periodical, j, dische, rundschau, on, 4, january, 1918, in, which, he, referred, to, the, declaration, as, une, blague, a, deception, and, promised, that, under, ottoman, rule, all, justifiable, wishes, of, the, jews, in, palestine, would, be, able, to, find, their, fulfilment, subject, to, the, absorptive, capacity, of, the, country, this, turkish, statement, was, endorsed, by, the, german, foreign, office, on, 5, january, 1918, on, 8, january, 1918, a, german, jewish, society, the, union, of, german, jewish, organizations, for, the, protection, of, the, rights, of, the, jews, of, the, east, was, formed, to, advocate, for, further, progress, for, jews, in, palestine, following, the, war, the, treaty, of, s, vres, was, signed, by,

incorporated, the, terms, of, the, balfour, declaration, with, respect, to, the, administration, of, palestine, within, such, boundaries, as, may, be, determined, by, the, principal, allied, powers, since, incorporation, of, the, declaration, into, the, treaty, of, s, vres, did, not, affect, the, legal, status, of, either, the, declaration, or, the, mandate, there, was, also, no, effect, when, s, vres, was, superseded, by, the, treaty, of, lausanne, which, did, not, include, any, reference, to, the, declaration, in, 1922, german, anti, semitic, theorist, alfred, rosenberg, in, his, primary, contribution, to, nazi, theory, on, zionism, der, staatsfeindliche, zionismus, zionism, the, enemy, of, the, state, accused, german, zionists, of, working, for, a, german, defeat, and, supporting, britain, and, the, implementation, of, the, balfour, declaration, in, a, version, of, the, stab, in, the, back, myth, adolf, hitler, took, a, similar, approach, in, some, of, his, speeches, from, 1920, onwards, with, the, advent, of, the, declaration, and, the, british, entry, into, jerusalem, on, 9, december, the, vatican, reversed, its, earlier, sympathetic, attitude, to, zionism, and, adopted, an, oppositional, stance, that, was, to, continue, until, the, early, 1990s, it, is, said, that, the, effect, of, the, balfour, declaration, was, to, leave, the, moslems, and, christians, dumbfounded, it, is, impossible, to, minimise, the, bitterness, of, the, awakening, they, considered, that, they, were, to, be, handed, over, to, an, oppression, which, they, hated, far, more, than, the, turk, s, and, were, aghast, at, the, thought, of, this, domination, prominent, people, openly, talk, of, betrayal, and, that, england, has, sold, the, country, and, received, the, price, towards, the, administration, adopted, the, attitude, of, we, want, the, jewish, state, and, we, won, t, wait, and, they, did, not, hesitate, to, avail, themselves, of, every, means, open, to, them, in, this, country, and, abroad, to, force, the, hand, of, an, administration, bound, to, respect, the, status, quo, and, to, commit, it, and, thereby, future, administrations, to, a, policy, not, contemplated, in, the, balfour, declaration, what, more, natural, than, that, should, fail, to, realise, the, immense, difficulties, the, administration, was, and, is, labouring, under, and, come, to, the, conclusion, that, the, openly, published, demands, of, the, jews, were, to, be, granted, and, the, guarantees, in, the, declaration, were, to, become, but, a, dead, letter, report, of, the, palin, commission, august, 1920, the, british, policy, as, stated, in, the, declaration, was, to, face, numerous, challenges, to, its, implementation, in, the, following, years, the, first, of, these, was, the, indirect, peace, negotiations, which, took, place, between, britain, and, the, ottomans, in, december, 1917, and, january, 1918, during, a, pause, in, the, hostilities, for, the, rainy, season, although, these, peace, talks, were, unsuccessful, archival, records, suggest, that, key, members, of, the, war, cabinet, may, have, been, willing, to, permit, leaving, palestine, under, nominal, turkish, sovereignty, as, part, of, an, overall, deal, in, october, 1919, almost, a, year, after, the, end, of, the, war, lord, curzon, succeeded, balfour, as, foreign, secretary, curzon, had, been, a, member, of, the, 1917, cabinet, that, had, approved, the, declaration, and, according, to, british, historian, sir, david, gilmour, curzon, had, been, the, only, senior, figure, in, the, british, government, at, the, time, who, foresaw, that, its, policy, would, lead, to, decades, of, arab, jewish, hostility, he, therefore, determined, to, pursue, a, policy, in, line, with, its, narrower, and, more, prudent, rather, than, the, wider, interpretation, following, bonar, law, s, appointment, as, prime, minister, in, late, 1922, curzon, wrote, to, law, that, he, regarded, the, declaration, as, the, worst, of, britain, s, middle, east, commitments, and, a, striking, contradiction, of, our, publicly, declared, principles, in, august, 1920, the, report, of, the, palin, commission, the, first, in, a, long, line, of, british, commissions, of, inquiry, on, the, question, of, palestine, during, the, mandate, period, noted, that, the, balfour, declaration, is, undoubtedly, the, starting, point, of, the, whole, trouble, the, conclusion, of, the, report, which, was, not, published, mentioned, the, balfour, declaration, three, times, stating, that, the, causes, of, the, alienation, and, exasperation, of, the, feelings, of, the, population, of, palestine, included, british, public, and, government, opinion, became, increasingly, unfavourable, to, state, support, for, zionism, even, sykes, had, begun, to, change, his, views, in, late, 1918, in, february, 1922, churchill, telegraphed, samuel, who, had, begun, his, role, as, high, commissioner, for, palestine, 18, months, earlier, asking, for, cuts, in, expenditure, and, noting, in, both, houses, of, parliament, there, is, growing, movement, of, hostility, against, zionist, policy, in, palestine, which, will, be, stimulated, by, recent, northcliffe, articles, i, do, not, attach, undue, importance, to, this, movement, but, it, is, increasingly, difficult, to, meet, the, argument, that, it, is, unfair, to, ask, the, british, taxpayer, already, overwhelmed, with, taxation, to, bear, the, cost, of, imposing, on, palestine, an, unpopular, policy, following, the, issuance, of, the, churchill, white, paper, in, june, 1922, the, house, of, lords, rejected, a, palestine, mandate, that, incorporated, the, balfour, declaration, by, 60, votes, to, 25, following, a, motion, issued, by, lord, islington, the, vote, proved, to, be, only, symbolic, as, it, was, subsequently, overruled, by, a, vote, in, the, house, of, commons, following, a, tactical, pivot, and, variety, of, promises, made, by, churchill, in, february, 1923, following, the, change, in, government, cavendish, in, a, lengthy, memorandum, for, the, cabinet, laid, the, foundation, for, a, secret, review, of, palestine, policy, it, would, be, idle, to, pretend, that, the, zionist, policy, is, other, than, an, unpopular, one, it, has, been, bitterly, attacked, in, parliament, and, is, still, being, fiercely, assailed, in, certain, sections, of, the, press, the, ostensible, grounds, of, attack, are, threefold, 1, the, alleged, violation, of, the, mcmahon, pledges, 2, the, injustice, of, imposing, upon, a, country, a, policy, to, which, the, great, majority, of, its, inhabitants, are, opposed, and, 3, the, financial, burden, upon, the, british, taxpayer, his, covering, note, asked, for, a, statement, of, policy, to, be, made, as, soon, as, possible, and, that, the, cabinet, ought, to, focus, on, three, questions, 1, whether, or, not, pledges, to, the, arabs, conflict, with, the, balfour, declaration, 2, if, not, whether, the, new, government, should, continue, the, policy, set, down, by, the, old, government, in, the, 1922, white, paper, and, 3, if, not, what, alternative, policy, should, be, adopted, stanley, baldwin, replacing, bonar, law, as, prime, minister, in, june, 1923, set, up, a, cabinet, sub, committee, whose, terms, of, reference, were, examine, palestine, policy, afresh, and, to, advise, the, full, cabinet, whether, britain, should, remain, in, palestine, and, whether, if, she, remained, the, pro, zionist, policy, should, be, continued, the, cabinet, approved, the, report, of, this, committee, on, 31, july, 1923, describing, it, as, nothing, short, of, remarkable, quigley, noted, that, the, government, was, admitting, to, itself, that, its, support, for, zionism, had, been, prompted, by, considerations, having, nothing, to, do, with, the, merits, of, zionism, or, its, consequences, for, palestine, as, huneidi, noted, wise, or, unwise, it, is, well, nigh, impossible, for, any, government, to, extricate, itself, without, a, substantial, sacrifice, of, consistency, and, self, respect, if, not, honour, the, wording, of, the, declaration, was, thus, incorporated, into, the, british, mandate, for, palestine, a, legal, instrument, that, created, mandatory, palestine, with, an, explicit, purpose, of, putting, the, declaration, into, effect, and, was, finally, formalized, in, september, 1923, unlike, the, declaration, itself, the, mandate, was, legally, binding, on, the, british, government, in, june, 1924, britain, made, its, report, to, the, permanent, mandates, commission, for, the, period, july, 1920, to, the, end, of, 1923, containing, nothing, of, the, candor, reflected, in, the, internal, documents, the, documents, relating, to, the, 1923, reappraisal, stayed, secret, until, the, early, 1970s, lloyd, george, and, balfour, remained, in, government, until, the, collapse, of, the, coalition, in, october, 1922, under, the, new, conservative, government, attempts, were, made, to, identify, the, background, to, and, motivations, for, the, declaration, a, private, cabinet, memorandum, was, produced, in, january, 1923, providing, a, summary, of, the, then, known, foreign, office, and, war, cabinet, records, leading, up, to, the, declaration, an, accompanying, foreign, office, note, asserted, that, the, primary, authors, of, the, declaration, were, balfour, sykes, weizmann, and, sokolow, with, perhaps, lord, rothschild, as, a, figure, in, the, background, and, that, negotiations, seem, to, have, been, mainly, oral, and, by, means, of, private, notes, and, memoranda, of, which, only, the, scantiest, records, seem, to, be, available, following, the, 1936, general, strike, that, was, to, degenerate, into, the, 1936, 1939, arab, revolt, in, palestine, the, most, significant, outbreak, of, violence, since, the, mandate, began, a, british, royal, commission, a, high, profile, public, inquiry, was, appointed, to, investigate, the, causes, of, the, unrest, the, palestine, royal, commission, appointed, with, significantly, broader, terms, of, reference, than, the, previous, british, inquiries, into, palestine, completed, its, 404, page, report, after, six, months, of, work, in, june, 1937, publishing, it, a, month, later, the, report, began, by, describing, the, history, of, the, problem, including, a, detailed, summary, of, the, origins, of, the, balfour, declaration, much, of, this, summary, relied, on, lloyd, george, s, personal, testimony, balfour, had, died, in, 1930, and, sykes, in, 1919, he, told, the, commission, that, the, declaration, was, made, due, to, propagandist, reasons, in, particular, jewish, sympathy, would, confirm, the, support, of, american, jewry, and, would, make, it, more, difficult, for, germany, to, reduce, her, military, commitments, and, improve, her, economic, position, on, the, eastern, front, two, years, later, in, his, memoirs, of, the, peace, conference, lloyd, george, described, a, total, of, nine, factors, motivating, his, decision, as, prime, minister, to, release, the, declaration, including, the, additional, reasons, that, a, jewish, presence, in, palestine, would, strengthen, britain, s, position, on, the, suez, canal, and, reinforce, the, route, to, their, imperial, dominion, in, india, these, geopolitical, calculations, were, debated, and, discussed, in, the, following, years, historians, agree, that, the, british, believed, that, expressing, support, would, appeal, to, jews, in, germany, and, the, united, states, given, two, of, woodrow, wilson, s, closest, advisors, were, known, to, be, avid, zionists, they, also, hoped, to, encourage, support, from, the, large, jewish, population, in, russia, in, addition, the, british, intended, to, pre, empt, the, expected, french, pressure, for, an, international, administration, in, palestine, some, historians, argue, that, the, british, government, s, decision, reflected, what, james, gelvin, professor, of, middle, eastern, history, at, ucla, calls, patrician, anti, semitism, in, the, overestimation, of, jewish, power, in, both, the, united, states, and, russia, american, zionism, was, still, in, its, infancy, in, 1914, the, zionist, federation, had, a, small, budget, of, about, 5, 000, and, only, 12, 000, members, despite, an, american, jewish, population, of, three, million, but, the, zionist, organizations, had, recently, succeeded, following, a, show, of, force, within, the, american, jewish, community, in, arranging, a, jewish, congress, to, debate, the, jewish, problem, as, a, whole, this, impacted, british, and, french, government, estimates, of, the, balance, of, power, within, the, american, jewish, public, avi, shlaim, emeritus, professor, of, international, relations, in, the, university, of, oxford, asserts, that, two, main, schools, of, thought, have, been, developed, on, the, question, of, the, primary, driving, force, behind, the, declaration, one, presented, in, 1961, by, leonard, stein, a, lawyer, and, former, political, secretary, to, the, world, zionist, organization, and, the, other, in, 1970, by, mayir, veret, then, professor, of, israeli, history, at, the, hebrew, university, of, jerusalem, shlaim, states, that, stein, does, not, reach, any, clear, cut, conclusions, but, that, implicit, in, his, narrative, is, that, the, declaration, resulted, primarily, from, the, activity, and, skill, of, the, zionists, whereas, according, to, veret, it, was, the, work, of, hard, headed, pragmatists, motivated, by, british, imperial, interests, in, the, middle, east, much, of, modern, scholarship, on, the, decision, to, issue, the, declaration, focuses, on, the, zionist, movement, and, rivalries, within, it, with, a, key, debate, being, whether, the, role, of, weizmann, was, decisive, or, whether, the, british, were, likely, to, have, issued, a, similar, declaration, in, any, event, danny, gutwein, professor, of, jewish, history, at, the, university, of, haifa, proposes, a, twist, on, an, old, idea, asserting, that, sykes, s, february, 1917, approach, to, the, zionists, was, the, defining, moment, and, that, it, was, consistent, with, the, pursuit, of, the, government, s, wider, agenda, to, partition, the, ottoman, empire, historian, j, c, hurewitz, has, written, that, british, support, for, a, jewish, homeland, in, palestine, was, part, of, an, effort, to, secure, a, land, bridge, between, egypt, and, the, persian, gulf, by, annexing, territory, from, the, ottoman, empire, the, declaration, had, two, indirect, consequences, the, emergence, of, israel, and, a, chronic, state, of, conflict, between, arabs, and, jews, throughout, the, middle, east, it, has, been, described, as, the, original, sin, with, respect, to, both, britain, s, failure, in, palestine, and, for, wider, events, in, palestine, the, statement, also, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, traditional, anti, zionism, of, religious, jews, some, of, whom, saw, it, as, divine, providence, this, contributed, to, the, growth, of, religious, zionism, amid, the, larger, zionist, movement, starting, in, 1920, intercommunal, conflict, in, mandatory, palestine, broke, out, which, widened, into, the, regional, arab, israeli, conflict, often, referred, to, as, the, world, s, most, intractable, conflict, the, dual, obligation, to, the, two, communities, quickly, proved, to, be, untenable, the, british, subsequently, concluded, that, it, was, impossible, for, them, to, pacify, the, two, communities, in, palestine, by, using, different, messages, for, different, audiences, the, palestine, royal, commission, in, making, the, first, official, proposal, for, partition, of, the, region, referred, to, the, requirements, as, contradictory, obligations, and, that, the, disease, is, so, deep, rooted, that, in, our, firm, conviction, the, only, hope, of, a, cure, lies, in, a, surgical, operation, following, the, 1936, 1939, arab, revolt, in, palestine, and, as, worldwide, tensions, rose, in, the, buildup, to, the, second, world, war, the, british, parliament, approved, the, white, paper, of, 1939, their, last, formal, statement, of, governing, policy, in, mandatory, palestine, declaring, that, palestine, should, not, become, a, jewish, state, and, placing, restrictions, on, jewish, immigration, whilst, the, british, considered, this, consistent, with, the, balfour, declaration, s, commitment, to, protect, the, rights, of, non, jews, many, zionists, saw, it, as, a, repudiation, of, the, declaration, although, this, policy, lasted, until, the, british, surrendered, the, mandate, in, 1948, it, served, only, to, highlight, the, fundamental, difficulty, for, britain, in, carrying, out, the, mandate, obligations, britain, s, involvement, in, this, became, one, of, the, most, controversial, parts, of, its, empire, s, history, and, damaged, its, reputation, in, the, middle, east, for, generations, according, to, historian, elizabeth, monroe, measured, by, british, interests, alone, one, of, the, greatest, mistakes, in, imperial, history, the, 2010, study, by, jonathan, schneer, specialist, in, modern, british, history, at, georgia, tech, concluded, that, because, the, build, up, to, the, declaration, was, characterized, by, contradictions, deceptions, misinterpretations, and, wishful, thinking, the, declaration, sowed, dragon, s, teeth, and, produced, a, murderous, harvest, and, we, go, on, harvesting, even, today, the, foundational, stone, for, modern, israel, had, been, laid, but, the, prediction, that, this, would, lay, the, groundwork, for, harmonious, arab, jewish, cooperation, proved, to, be, wishful, thinking, on, the, bicentenary, of, its, foundation, the, british, newspaper, the, guardian, reflecting, on, its, major, errors, of, judgment, included, the, support, the, paper, s, editor, c, p, scott, gave, to, balfour, s, declaration, israel, had, not, become, it, said, the, country, the, guardian, foresaw, or, would, have, wanted, the, board, of, deputies, of, british, jews, through, its, president, marie, van, der, zyl, denounced, the, column, as, breathtakingly, ill, considered, declaring, that, the, guardian, appeared, to, do, everything, it, can, to, undermine, the, legitimacy, of, the, world, s, only, jewish, state, the, document, was, presented, to, the, british, museum, in, 1924, by, walter, rothschild, today, it, is, held, in, the, british, library, which, separated, from, the, british, museum, in, 1973, as, additional, manuscripts, number, 41178, from, october, 1987, to, may, 1988, it, was, lent, outside, the, uk, for, display, in, israel, s, knesset, what, exactly, was, in, the, minds, of, those, who, made, the, balfour, declaration, is, speculative, the, fact, remains, that, in, the, light, of, experience, acquired, as, a, consequence, of, serious, disturbances, in, palestine, the, mandatory, power, in, a, statement, on, british, policy, in, palestine, issued, on, 3, june, 1922, by, the, colonial, office, placed, a, restrictive, construction, upon, the, balfour, declaration, nevertheless, neither, the, balfour, declaration, nor, the, mandate, precluded, the, eventual, creation, of, a, jewish, state, the, mandate, in, its, preamble, recognized, with, regard, to, the, jewish, people, the, grounds, for, reconstituting, their, national, home, by, providing, as, one, of, the, main, obligations, of, the, mandatory, power, the, facilitation, of, jewish, immigration, it, conferred, upon, the, jews, an, opportunity, through, large, scale, immigration, to, create, eventually, a, jewish, state, with, a, jewish, majority
