sound, change, from, to, l, in, the, scythian, language, the, term, evolved, into, the, form, skulat, this, designation, was, recorded, in, greek, as, sk, lotoi, which, according, to, herodotus, of, halicarnassus, was, the, self, designation, of, the, tribe, of, the, royal, scythians, the, assyrians, rendered, the, name, of, the, scythians, as, i, kuzaya, m, t, i, kuzaya, and, aw, l, i, kuzaya,

designate, all, early, eurasian, nomads, although, the, validity, of, such, terminology, is, controversial, and, other, terms, such, as, early, nomadic, have, been, deemed, preferable, although, the, scythians, saka, and, cimmerians, were, closely, related, nomadic, iranic, peoples, and, the, ancient, babylonians, ancient, persians, and, ancient, greeks, respectively, used, the, names, cimmerian, saka, and, scythian, for, all, the, steppe, nomads, and, early, modern, historians, such, as, edward, gibbon, used, the, term, scythian, to, refer, to, a, variety, of, nomadic, and, semi, nomadic, peoples, across, the, eurasian, steppe, the, scythians, share, several, cultural, similarities, with, other, populations, living, to, their, east, in, particular, similar, weapons, horse, gear, and, scythian, art, which, has, been, referred, to, as, the, scythian, triad, cultures, sharing, these, characteristics, have, often, been, referred, to, as, scythian, cultures, and, its, peoples, called, scythians, peoples, associated, with, scythian, cultures, include, not, only, the, scythians, themselves, who, were, a, distinct, ethnic, group, but, also, cimmerians, massagetae, saka, sarmatians, and, various, obscure, peoples, of, the, east, european, forest, steppe, such, as, early, slavs, balts, and, finno, ugric, peoples, within, this, broad, definition, of, the, term, scythian, the, westernmost, scythians, have, often, been, distinguished, from, other, groups, through, the, terms, classical, scythians, western, scythians, european, scythians, or, pontic, scythians, nevertheless, the, archaeologist, maurits, nanning, van, loon, in, 1966, instead, used, the, term, western, scythians, to, designate, the, cimmerians, and, referred, to, the, scythians, proper, as, the, eastern, scythians, scythologist, askold, ivantchik, notes, with, dismay, that, the, term, scythian, has, been, used, within, both, a, broad, and, a, narrow, context, leading, to, a, good, deal, of, confusion, he, reserves, the, term, scythian, for, the, iranic, people, dominating, the, pontic, steppe, from, the, 7th, century, bc, to, the, 3rd, century, bc, nicola, di, cosmo, writes, that, the, broad, concept, of, scythian, to, describe, the, early, nomadic, populations, of, the, eurasian, steppe, is, too, broad, to, be, viable, and, that, the, term, early, nomadic, is, preferable, the, earliest, scythian, groups, and, scythian, culture, are, thought, to, have, emerged, with, the, early, sakas, from, eastern, eurasia, in, the, early, 1st, millennium, bc, after, migrating, out, of, central, asia, and, into, the, western, steppes, the, scythians, first, settled, and, established, their, kingdom, in, the, area, between, the, araxes, the, caucasus, mountains, and, the, lake, maeotis, in, west, asia, the, scythians, initially, settled, in, the, area, between, the, araxes, and, kura, rivers, before, further, expanding, into, the, region, to, the, south, of, the, kura, in, what, is, present, day, azerbaijan, where, they, settled, around, what, is, today, mingachevir, ganja, and, the, mughan, plain, transcaucasia, remained, their, centre, of, operations, in, west, asia, until, the, early, 6th, century, bc, although, this, presence, in, west, asia, remained, an, extension, of, the, scythian, kingdom, of, the, steppes, and, the, scythian, kings, headquarters, were, instead, located, in, the, ciscaucasian, steppes, during, the, peak, of, the, scythians, power, in, west, asia, after, they, had, conquered, media, mannai, and, urartu, and, defeated, the, cimmerians, the, scythian, kingdom, s, possessions, in, the, region, consisted, of, a, large, area, extending, from, the, halys, river, in, anatolia, in, the, west, to, the, caspian, sea, and, the, western, borders, of, media, in, the, east, and, from, transcaucasia, in, the, north, to, the, northern, borders, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, in, the, south, the, territory, of, the, scythian, kingdom, of, the, pontic, steppe, extended, from, the, don, river, in, the, east, to, the, danube, river, in, the, west, and, covered, the, territory, of, the, treeless, steppe, immediately, north, of, the, black, sea, s, coastline, which, was, inhabited, by, nomadic, pastoralists, as, well, as, the, fertile, black, earth, forest, steppe, area, to, the, north, of, the, treeless, steppe, which, was, inhabited, by, an, agricultural, population, and, the, northern, border, of, this, scythian, kingdom, were, the, dedicuous, woodlands, several, rivers, flowed, southwards, across, this, region, and, emptied, themselves, into, the, black, sea, of, which, the, largest, one, was, the, borysthenes, dnipro, which, was, the, richest, river, in, scythia, with, most, of, the, fish, living, in, it, and, the, best, pastures, and, most, fertile, lands, being, located, on, its, banks, while, its, water, was, the, cleanest, due, to, this, graeco, roman, authors, compared, it, to, the, nile, in, egypt, other, important, rivers, of, scythia, were, the, the, region, within, the, scythian, pontic, realm, which, was, covered, with, forests, was, named, by, the, greeks, as, the, country, of, hylaea, ancient, greek, romanized, hulaia, lit, the, woodland, and, consisted, of, the, region, of, the, lower, dnipro, river, along, the, territory, of, what, is, modern, day, kherson, earlier, ancient, west, asian, and, greek, sources, also, included, ciscaucasia, within, the, confines, of, scythia, however, ciscaucasia, was, no, longer, part, of, scythia, by, the, 5th, century, bc, and, the, don, river, formed, its, easternmost, limit, after, the, 3rd, century, bc, scythian, territory, became, restricted, to, two, small, states, each, called, scythia, minor, located, in, dobruja, and, crimea, respectively, because, the, scythians, did, not, use, writing, and, they, did, not, leave, much, material, remains, due, to, their, nomadic, lifestyle, most, of, the, information, regarding, them, has, been, pieced, from, the, accounts, of, outsiders, such, as, the, assyrians, persians, and, greeks, as, well, as, from, archaeological, study, of, their, burial, mounds, based, on, initial, archaeological, evidence, it, was, generally, agreed, that, the, scythians, originated, in, the, region, of, the, volga, ural, steppes, of, western, central, asia, possibly, around, the, 9th, century, bc, as, a, section, of, the, population, of, the, srubnaya, culture, containing, a, significant, element, originating, from, the, siberian, andronovo, culture, the, population, of, the, srubnaya, culture, was, among, the, first, truly, nomadic, pastoralist, groups, who, themselves, emerged, in, the, central, asian, and, siberian, steppes, during, the, 9th, century, bc, as, a, result, of, the, cold, and, dry, climate, then, prevailing, in, these, regions, based, on, more, recent, archaeological, evidence, eastern, central, asia, and, the, altaian, region, is, now, favored, as, initial, place, of, origin, of, the, scythian, material, culture, which, later, would, have, been, mediated, westwards, paired, with, at, least, some, demic, diffusion, via, saka, like, groups, the, saka, themself, arose, from, admixture, between, earlier, eastern, iranian, peoples, with, local, siberian, groups, as, such, the, emergence, of, scythian, cultures, is, not, a, direct, continuation, of, the, bronze, age, srubnaya, culture, but, a, later, development, genetic, evidence, has, suggested, that, western, scythians, may, have, been, closely, related, to, the, srubnaya, culture, however, this, does, not, imply, direct, continuity, from, srubnaya, and, the, western, scythians, themselves, derived, ancestry, from, other, populations, as, well, during, the, 9th, to, 8th, centuries, bc, a, significant, movement, of, the, nomadic, peoples, of, the, eurasian, steppe, started, when, another, nomadic, iranic, tribe, closely, related, to, the, scythians, from, eastern, central, asia, either, the, massagetae, or, the, issedones, migrated, westwards, forcing, the, early, scythians, to, the, west, across, the, araxes, river, following, which, some, scythian, tribes, had, migrated, westwards, into, the, steppe, adjacent, to, the, shores, of, the, black, sea, which, they, occupied, along, with, the, cimmerians, who, were, also, a, nomadic, iranic, people, closely, related, to, the, scythians, arrowheads, from, the, 1st, kurgan, of, the, arzhan, burials, suggests, that, the, typical, scythian, socketed, arrows, made, of, copper, alloy, might, have, originated, during, this, period, over, the, course, of, the, 8th, and, 7th, centuries, bc, the, scythians, migrated, into, the, caucasian, and, caspian, steppes, in, several, waves, becoming, the, dominant, population, of, the, region, where, they, assimilated, most, of, the, cimmerians, and, conquered, their, territory, with, this, absorption, of, the, cimmerians, by, the, scythians, being, facilitated, by, their, similar, ethnic, backgrounds, and, lifestyles, after, which, the, scythians, settled, in, the, area, between, the, araxes, the, caucasus, and, the, lake, maeotis, archaeologically, the, westwards, migration, of, the, early, scythians, from, central, asia, into, the, caspian, steppe, constituted, the, latest, of, the, two, to, three, waves, of, expansion, of, the, srubnaya, culture, to, the, west, of, the, volga, the, last, and, third, wave, corresponding, to, the, scythian, migration, has, been, dated, to, the, 9th, century, bc, the, scythians, were, already, skilled, at, goldsmithing, at, these, early, dates, materially, the, chernogorovka, novocherkassk, culture, with, which, the, cimmerians, are, associated, showed, strong, influences, originating, from, the, east, in, central, asia, and, siberia, more, specifically, from, the, karasuk, arzhan, and, altai, cultures, as, well, as, from, the, kuban, culture, of, the, caucasus, which, contributed, to, its, development, thus, making, it, difficult, to, distinguish, from, the, late, srubnaya, culture, of, the, early, scythians, who, became, dominant, in, the, pontic, steppe, and, replaced, the, cimmerians, in, the, caucasian, steppe, with, both, the, cimmerians, and, the, scythians, being, part, of, the, larger, chernagorovsk, arzhan, cultural, complex, and, both, scythians, and, the, cimmerians, used, novocherkassk, objects, when, the, scythians, initially, arrived, into, the, caucasian, and, pontic, steppes, the, transition, from, the, chernogorovka, novocherkassk, culture, to, the, scythian, culture, appears, to, have, itself, been, a, continuous, process, and, the, cimmerians, cannot, be, distinguished, from, the, scythians, during, the, period, of, transition, from, the, chernogorovka, novocherkassk, culture, to, the, scythian, culture, during, this, early, migratory, period, some, groups, of, scythians, settled, in, ciscaucasia, and, the, caucasus, mountains, foothills, to, the, east, of, the, kuban, river, where, they, settled, among, the, native, populations, of, this, region, and, did, not, migrate, to, the, south, into, west, asia, under, scythian, pressure, the, displaced, cimmerians, migrated, to, the, south, along, the, coast, of, the, black, sea, and, reached, anatolia, and, the, scythians, in, turn, later, expanded, to, the, south, following, the, coast, of, the, caspian, sea, and, arrived, in, the, ciscaucasian, steppes, from, where, they, settled, in, the, area, between, the, araxes, and, kura, rivers, before, further, expanding, into, the, region, to, the, south, of, the, kuros, river, in, what, is, present, day, azerbaijan, where, they, settled, around, what, is, today, ming, evir, g, nc, and, the, mu, an, plain, and, turned, eastern, transcaucasia, into, their, centre, of, operations, in, west, asia, until, the, early, 6th, century, bc, with, this, presence, in, west, asia, being, an, extension, of, the, scythian, kingdom, of, the, steppes, the, earliest, scythians, had, belonged, to, the, srubnaya, culture, and, archaeologically, the, scythian, movement, into, transcaucasia, is, attested, in, the, form, of, a, migration, of, a, section, of, the, srubnaya, culture, called, the, srubnaya, khvalynsk, culture, to, the, south, till, the, northern, foothills, of, the, caucasus, mountains, and, then, further, south, along, the, western, coast, of, the, caspian, sea, into, transcaucasia, and, iran, although, the, early, scythians, initially, belonged, to, a, pre, scythian, archaeological, culture, of, central, asian, origin, their, original, srubnaya, culture, which, contained, significant, admixture, from, the, andronovo, culture, evolved, into, the, scythian, culture, from, coming, in, contact, with, the, peoples, of, transcaucasia, and, the, urartians, and, further, contacts, with, the, civilisation, of, west, asia, and, especially, with, that, of, mesopotamia, would, also, have, an, important, influence, on, the, formation, of, scythian, culture, the, scythians, were, still, a, bronze, age, society, until, the, late, 8th, century, bc, and, it, was, only, when, they, expanded, into, west, asia, that, they, became, acquainted, with, iron, smelting, and, forging, during, this, period, the, scythian, kings, headquarters, were, located, in, the, ciscaucasian, steppes, and, this, presence, in, transcaucasia, influenced, scythian, culture, the, ak, nak, s, sword, and, socketed, bronze, arrowheads, with, three, edges, which, although, they, are, considered, as, typically, scythian, weapons, were, in, fact, of, transcaucasian, origin, and, had, been, adopted, by, the, scythians, during, their, stay, in, the, caucasus, alternatively, the, typical, scythian, arrowheads, might, have, originated, in, siberia, during, the, 9th, century, bc, and, was, introduced, into, west, asia, by, the, scythians, from, their, base, in, the, caucasian, steppe, during, the, period, of, the, 8th, to, 7th, centuries, bc, itself, the, scythians, conquered, the, pontic, and, crimean, steppes, to, the, north, of, the, black, sea, up, to, the, danube, river, which, formed, the, western, boundary, of, scythian, territory, onwards, with, this, process, of, scythian, takeover, of, the, pontic, steppe, becoming, fully, complete, by, the, 7th, century, bc, archaeologically, the, expansion, of, the, scythians, into, the, pontic, steppe, is, attested, through, the, westward, movement, of, the, srubnaya, khvalynsk, culture, into, ukraine, contemporaneous, with, its, movement, to, the, south, along, the, coast, of, the, caspian, sea, the, srubnaya, khvalynsk, culture, in, ukraine, is, referred, to, in, scholarship, as, the, late, srubnaya, culture, the, westward, migration, of, the, scythians, was, accompanied, by, the, introduction, into, the, north, pontic, region, of, articles, originating, in, the, siberian, karasuk, culture, such, as, distinctive, swords, and, daggers, and, which, were, characteristic, of, early, scythian, archaeological, culture, consisting, of, cast, bronze, cauldrons, daggers, swords, and, horse, harnesses, which, had, themselves, been, influenced, by, chinese, art, with, for, example, the, cruciform, tubes, used, to, fix, strap, crossings, being, of, types, which, had, initially, been, modelled, by, shang, artisans, the, scythian, migration, into, the, pontic, steppe, destroyed, earlier, cultures, with, the, settlements, of, the, sabatynivka, culture, in, the, dnipro, valley, being, largely, destroyed, around, c, 800, bc, and, the, centre, of, cimmerian, bronze, production, ceasing, to, exist, during, the, 8th, to, 7th, centuries, bc, around, the, time, which, the, chernogorovka, novocherkassk, culture, was, also, disturbed, the, migration, of, the, scythians, affected, the, steppe, and, forest, steppe, areas, of, south, east, europe, and, forced, several, other, populations, of, the, region, especially, many, smaller, groups, to, migrate, towards, more, remote, regions, including, some, north, caucasian, groups, who, retreated, to, the, west, and, settled, in, transylvania, and, the, hungarian, plain, where, they, introduced, novocherkassk, culture, type, swords, daggers, horse, harnesses, and, other, objects, among, these, displaced, smaller, populations, from, the, caucasus, were, the, sigynnae, who, were, displaced, westward, into, the, eastern, part, of, the, pannonian, basin, among, the, many, peoples, displaced, by, the, scythian, expansion, were, also, the, gelonians, and, the, agathyrsi, the, latter, of, whom, were, another, nomadic, iranic, people, related, to, the, scythians, as, well, as, one, of, the, oldest, iranic, population, to, have, dominated, the, pontic, steppe, the, agathyrsi, were, pushed, westwards, by, the, scythians, away, from, the, steppes, and, from, their, original, home, around, lake, maeotis, after, which, the, relations, between, the, two, populations, remained, hostile, within, the, pontic, steppe, some, of, the, scythian, tribes, intermarried, with, the, already, present, native, sedentary, thracian, populations, to, form, new, tribes, such, as, the, nomadic, scythians, and, the, alazones, in, many, parts, of, the, north, pontic, region, under, their, rule, the, scythians, established, themselves, as, a, ruling, class, over, already, present, sedentary, populations, including, thracians, in, the, western, regions, maeotians, on, the, eastern, shore, of, lake, maeotis, and, later, the, greeks, on, the, north, coast, of, the, black, sea, between, 650, and, 625, bc, the, pontic, scythians, came, into, contact, with, the, greeks, who, were, starting, to, create, colonies, in, the, areas, under, scythian, rule, including, on, the, island, of, borysthenes, near, taganrog, on, lake, maeotis, as, well, as, more, places, including, panticapaeum, pontic, olbia, and, phanagoria, and, hermonassa, on, the, taman, peninsula, the, greeks, carried, out, thriving, commercial, ties, with, the, sedentary, peoples, of, the, forest, steppe, who, lived, to, the, north, of, the, scythians, with, the, large, rivers, of, eastern, europe, which, flowed, into, the, black, sea, forming, the, main, access, routes, to, these, northern, markets, this, process, put, the, scythians, into, permanent, contact, with, the, greeks, and, the, relations, between, the, latter, and, the, greek, colonies, remained, peaceful, although, the, scythians, might, have, destroyed, panticapaeum, at, some, point, in, the, middle, of, the, 6th, century, bc, the, territory, around, pontic, olbia, was, under, the, direct, rule, of, that, city, and, was, inhabited, only, by, greeks, using, the, pontic, steppe, as, their, base, the, scythians, over, the, course, of, the, 7th, to, 6th, centuries, bc, often, raided, into, the, adjacent, regions, with, central, europe, being, a, frequent, target, of, their, raids, and, scythian, incursions, reaching, podolia, transylvania, and, the, hungarian, plain, due, to, which, beginning, in, this, period, and, from, the, end, of, the, 7th, century, onwards, new, objects, including, weapons, and, horse, equipment, originating, from, the, steppes, and, remains, associated, with, the, early, scythians, started, appearing, within, central, europe, especially, in, the, thracian, and, hungarian, plains, and, in, the, regions, corresponding, to, present, day, bessarabia, transylvania, hungary, and, slovakia, multiple, fortified, settlements, of, the, lusatian, culture, were, destroyed, by, scythian, attacks, during, this, period, with, the, scythian, onslaught, causing, the, destruction, of, the, lusatian, culture, itself, attacks, by, the, scythians, were, directed, at, southern, germania, and, from, there, until, as, far, as, gaul, and, possibly, even, the, iberian, peninsula, these, activities, of, the, scythians, were, not, unlike, those, of, the, huns, and, the, avars, during, the, migration, period, and, of, the, mongols, in, the, mediaeval, era, and, they, were, recorded, in, etruscan, bronze, figurines, depicting, mounted, scythian, archers, as, well, as, in, scythian, influences, in, celtic, art, among, the, sites, in, central, europe, attacked, by, the, scythians, was, that, of, smolenice, molp, r, where, scythian, type, arrows, were, found, at, this, fortified, hillfort, s, access, points, at, the, gate, and, the, south, west, side, of, the, acropolis, the, scythians, attacked, sacked, and, destroyed, many, of, the, wealthy, and, important, iron, age, settlements, located, to, the, north, and, south, of, the, moravian, gate, and, belonging, to, the, eastern, group, of, the, hallstatt, culture, including, that, of, smolenice, molp, r, leading, to, the, adoption, of, the, scythian, type, animal, style, art, and, mounted, archery, by, the, population, of, these, regions, in, the, subsequent, period, it, was, also, at, this, time, that, the, scythians, introduced, metalwork, types, which, followed, shang, chinese, models, into, western, eurasia, where, they, were, adopted, by, the, hallstatt, culture, as, part, of, the, scythians, expansion, into, europe, one, section, of, the, scythian, sindi, tribe, migrated, during, the, 7th, to, 6th, centuries, bc, from, the, region, of, the, lake, maeotis, towards, the, west, through, transylvania, into, the, eastern, pannonian, basin, where, they, settled, alongside, the, sigynnae, and, soon, lost, contact, with, the, scythians, of, the, pontic, steppe, another, section, of, the, sindi, established, themselves, on, the, taman, peninsula, where, they, formed, a, ruling, class, over, the, indigenous, maeotians, the, latter, of, whom, were, of, native, caucasian, origin, during, the, earliest, phase, of, their, presence, in, west, asia, the, scythians, under, their, king, i, pakaia, were, allied, with, the, cimmerians, and, the, two, groups, in, alliance, with, the, medes, who, were, an, iranic, people, of, west, asia, to, whom, the, scythians, and, cimmerians, were, distantly, related, as, well, as, the, mannaeans, were, threatening, the, eastern, frontier, of, the, kingdom, of, urartu, during, the, reign, of, its, king, argishti, ii, who, reigned, from, 714, to, 680, bc, argishti, ii, s, successor, rusa, ii, built, several, fortresses, in, the, east, of, urartu, s, territory, including, that, of, teishebaini, to, monitor, and, repel, attacks, by, the, cimmerians, the, mannaeans, the, medes, and, the, scythians, the, first, mention, of, the, scythians, in, the, records, of, the, then, superpower, of, west, asia, the, neo, assyrian, empire, is, from, between, 680, 679, and, 678, 677, bc, when, their, king, i, pakaia, joined, an, alliance, with, the, mannaeans, and, the, cimmerians, in, an, attack, on, the, neo, assyrian, empire, during, this, time, the, scythians, under, i, pakaia, allied, to, rusa, ii, of, urartu, were, raiding, far, in, the, south, till, the, assyrian, province, of, zamua, these, allied, forces, were, defeated, by, the, assyrian, king, esarhaddon, the, mannaeans, in, alliance, with, an, eastern, group, of, the, cimmerians, who, had, migrated, into, the, iranic, plateau, and, with, the, scythians, the, latter, of, whom, attacked, the, borderlands, of, assyria, from, across, the, territory, of, the, kingdom, of, ubu, kia, were, able, to, expand, their, territories, at, the, expense, of, assyria, and, capture, the, fortresses, of, arru, iqbi, and, d, r, ellil, negotiations, between, the, assyrians, and, the, cimmerians, appeared, to, have, followed, according, to, which, the, cimmerians, promised, not, to, interfere, in, the, relations, between, assyria, and, mannai, although, a, babylonian, diviner, in, assyrian, service, warned, esarhaddon, not, to, trust, either, the, mannaeans, or, the, cimmerians, and, advised, him, to, spy, on, both, of, them, in, 676, bc, esarhaddon, responded, by, carrying, out, a, military, campaign, against, mannai, during, which, he, killed, i, pakaia, i, pakaia, was, succeeded, by, bartatua, who, might, have, been, his, son, in, the, later, mid, 670s, bc, in, alliance, with, the, eastern, cimmerians, the, scythians, were, menacing, the, assyrian, provinces, of, parsuma, and, b, t, amban, and, these, joint, cimmerian, scythian, forces, together, were, threatening, communication, between, the, assyrian, empire, and, its, vassal, of, ubu, kia, the, mannaeans, eastern, cimmerians, and, medes, soon, joined, a, grand, coalition, headed, by, the, median, chieftain, kashtariti, i, pakaia, was, succeeded, by, bartatua, who, might, have, been, his, son, and, with, whom, they, had, already, started, negotiations, immediately, after, i, pakaia, s, death, and, they, had, been, able, to, defeat, kashtariti, in, the, meantime, in, 674, bc, after, which, his, coalition, disintegrated, in, 672, bc, bartatua, himself, sought, a, rapprochement, with, the, assyrians, and, asked, for, the, hand, of, esarhaddon, s, daughter, r, a, irat, in, marriage, which, is, attested, in, esarhaddon, s, questions, to, the, oracle, of, the, sun, god, ama, whether, this, marriage, did, happen, is, not, recorded, in, the, assyrian, texts, but, the, close, alliance, between, the, scythians, and, assyria, under, the, reigns, of, bartatua, and, his, son, and, successor, madyes, suggests, that, the, assyrian, priests, did, approve, of, this, marriage, between, a, daughter, of, an, assyrian, king, and, a, nomadic, lord, which, had, never, happened, before, in, assyrian, history, thus, the, scythians, were, separated, from, the, medes, and, were, brought, into, a, marital, alliance, with, assyria, and, r, a, irat, was, likely, the, mother, of, bartatua, s, son, madyes, bartatua, s, marriage, to, r, a, irat, required, that, he, would, pledge, allegiance, to, assyria, as, a, vassal, and, in, accordance, to, assyrian, law, the, territories, ruled, by, him, would, be, his, fief, granted, by, the, assyrian, king, which, made, the, scythian, presence, in, west, asia, a, nominal, extension, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, and, bartatua, himself, an, assyrian, viceroy, under, this, arrangement, the, power, of, the, scythians, in, west, asia, heavily, depended, on, their, cooperation, with, the, assyrian, empire, henceforth, the, scythians, remained, allies, of, the, assyrian, empire, with, bartatua, helping, the, assyrians, by, defeating, the, state, of, mannai, and, imposing, scythian, hegemony, over, it, around, this, time, the, urartian, king, rusa, ii, might, also, have, enlisted, scythian, troops, to, guard, his, western, borderlands, the, marital, alliance, between, the, scythian, king, and, the, assyrian, ruling, dynasty, as, well, as, the, proximity, of, the, scythians, with, the, assyrian, influenced, mannai, and, urartu, thus, placed, the, scythians, under, the, strong, influence, of, assyrian, culture, and, contact, with, the, civilisation, of, west, asia, would, have, an, important, influence, on, the, formation, of, scythian, culture, among, the, concepts, initially, foreign, to, the, scythians, which, they, had, adopted, from, the, mesopotamian, and, transcaucasian, peoples, was, that, of, the, divine, origin, of, royal, power, as, well, as, the, practice, of, performing, human, sacrifices, during, royal, funerals, and, the, scythian, kings, henceforth, imitated, the, style, of, rulership, of, the, west, asian, kings, the, scythians, adopted, many, elements, of, the, cultures, of, the, populations, of, urartu, and, transcaucasia, especially, of, more, effective, weapons, typically, scythian, weapons, including, the, ak, nak, s, sword, and, socketed, arrowheads, were, originally, of, transcaucasian, or, for, the, arroheads, siberian, origin, later, adopted, and, spread, into, west, asia, by, the, scythians, the, art, typical, of, the, scythians, proper, originated, between, 650, and, 600, bc, for, the, needs, of, the, royal, scythians, at, the, time, when, they, ruled, over, large, swathes, of, west, asia, with, the, objects, of, the, ziwiye, hoard, being, the, first, example, of, this, art, later, examples, of, this, west, asian, influenced, art, from, the, 6th, century, bc, were, found, in, western, ciscaucasia, as, well, as, in, the, melhuniv, kurhan, in, what, is, presently, ukraine, and, in, the, witaszkowo, kurgan, in, what, is, modern, day, poland, this, art, style, was, initially, restricted, to, the, scythian, upper, classes, and, the, scythian, lower, classes, in, both, west, asia, and, the, pontic, steppe, had, not, yet, adopted, it, with, the, latter, group, s, bone, cheek, pieces, and, bronze, buckles, being, plain, and, without, decorations, while, the, pontic, groups, were, still, using, srubnaya, and, andronovo, type, geometric, patterns, within, the, scythian, religion, the, goddess, artimpasa, and, the, snake, legged, goddess, were, significantly, influenced, by, the, mesopotamian, and, syro, canaanite, religions, and, respectively, absorbed, elements, from, astarte, ishtar, aphrodite, for, artimpasa, and, from, atargatis, derceto, for, the, snake, legged, goddess, over, the, course, of, 660, to, 659, bc, esarhaddon, s, son, and, successor, to, the, assyrian, throne, ashurbanipal, sent, his, general, nab, ar, u, ur, to, carry, out, a, military, campaign, against, mannai, after, trying, in, vain, to, stop, the, assyrian, advance, the, mannaean, king, a, s, ri, was, overthrown, by, a, popular, rebellion, and, was, killed, along, with, most, of, his, dynasty, by, the, revolting, populace, after, which, his, surviving, son, ualli, requested, help, from, assyria, which, was, provided, through, the, intermediary, of, ashurbanipal, s, relative, the, scythian, king, bartatua, after, which, the, scythians, extended, their, hegemony, to, mannai, itself, around, this, same, time, bartatua, s, scythians, were, also, able, to, take, over, a, significant, section, of, the, south, eastern, territories, of, the, state, of, urartu, bartatua, was, succeeded, by, his, son, with, r, a, irat, madyes, who, soon, expanded, the, scythian, hegemony, to, the, state, of, urartu, when, following, a, period, of, assyrian, decline, over, the, course, of, the, 650s, bc, esarhaddon, s, other, son, ama, uma, ukin, who, had, succeeded, him, as, the, king, of, babylon, revolted, against, his, brother, ashurbanipal, in, 652, bc, the, medes, supported, him, and, madyes, helped, ashurbanipal, suppress, the, revolt, externally, by, invading, the, medes, the, median, king, phraortes, was, killed, in, battle, either, against, the, assyrians, or, against, madyes, himself, who, then, imposed, scythian, hegemony, over, the, medes, for, twenty, eight, years, on, behalf, of, the, assyrians, thus, starting, a, period, which, greek, authors, called, called, the, scythian, rule, over, asia, with, media, mannai, and, urartu, all, continuing, to, exist, as, kingdoms, under, scythian, suzerainty, during, this, period, the, medes, adopted, scythian, archery, techniques, and, equipment, due, to, their, superiority, over, those, of, the, west, asian, peoples, and, the, trade, of, silk, to, western, eurasia, might, have, started, at, this, time, through, the, intermediary, of, the, scythians, during, their, stay, in, west, asia, with, the, earliest, presence, of, silk, in, this, part, of, the, world, having, been, found, in, a, urartian, fortress, presumably, imported, from, china, through, the, intermediary, of, the, scythians, during, the, 7th, century, bc, the, bulk, of, cimmerians, were, operating, in, anatolia, where, they, constituted, a, threat, against, the, scythians, assyrian, allies, who, since, 669, bc, were, ruled, by, madyes, s, uncle, that, is, esarhaddon, s, son, and, r, a, irat, s, brother, ashurbanipal, assyrian, records, in, 657, bc, might, have, referred, to, a, threat, against, or, a, conquest, of, the, western, possessions, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, in, syria, and, these, cimmerian, aggressions, worried, ashurbanipal, about, the, security, of, his, empire, s, north, west, border, by, 657, bc, the, assyrian, divinatory, records, were, calling, the, cimmerian, king, tugdammi, by, the, title, of, ar, ki, ati, king, of, the, universe, which, could, normally, belong, only, to, the, neo, assyrian, king, thus, tugdammi, s, successes, against, assyria, meant, that, he, had, become, recognised, in, ancient, west, asia, as, equally, powerful, as, ashurbanipal, and, the, kingship, over, the, universe, which, rightfully, belonged, to, the, assyrian, king, had, been, usurped, by, the, cimmerians, and, had, to, be, won, back, by, assyria, this, situation, continued, throughout, the, rest, of, the, 650s, bc, and, the, early, 640s, bc, in, 644, bc, the, cimmerians, led, by, tugdammi, attacked, the, kingdom, of, lydia, defeated, the, lydians, and, captured, the, lydian, capital, sardis, the, lydian, king, gyges, died, during, this, attack, after, sacking, sardis, tugdammi, led, the, cimmerians, into, invading, the, greek, city, states, of, ionia, and, aeolis, on, the, western, coast, of, anatolia, after, this, attack, on, lydia, and, the, asian, greek, cities, around, 640, bc, the, cimmerians, moved, to, cilicia, on, the, north, west, border, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, where, after, tugdammi, faced, a, revolt, against, himself, he, allied, with, assyria, and, acknowledged, assyrian, overlordship, and, sent, tribute, to, ashurbanipal, to, whom, he, swore, an, oath, tugdammi, soon, broke, this, oath, and, attacked, the, neo, assyrian, empire, again, but, he, fell, ill, and, died, in, 640, bc, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, sandak, atru, in, 637, bc, the, thracian, treres, tribe, who, had, migrated, across, the, thracian, bosporus, and, invaded, anatolia, under, their, king, k, bos, and, in, alliance, with, sandak, atru, s, cimmerians, and, the, lycians, attacked, lydia, during, the, seventh, year, of, the, reign, of, gyges, s, son, ardys, they, defeated, the, lydians, and, captured, their, capital, of, sardis, except, for, its, citadel, and, ardys, might, have, been, killed, in, this, attack, ardys, s, son, and, successor, sadyattes, might, possibly, also, have, been, killed, in, another, cimmerian, attack, on, lydia, in, 635, bc, soon, after, 635, bc, with, assyrian, approval, and, in, alliance, with, the, lydians, the, scythians, under, madyes, entered, anatolia, expelled, the, treres, from, asia, minor, and, defeated, the, cimmerians, so, that, they, no, longer, constituted, a, threat, again, following, which, the, scythians, extended, their, domination, to, central, anatolia, this, final, defeat, of, the, cimmerians, was, carried, out, by, the, joint, forces, of, madyes, whom, strabo, credits, with, expelling, the, treres, and, cimmerians, from, asia, minor, and, of, the, son, of, sadyattes, and, the, great, grandson, of, gyges, the, lydian, king, alyattes, whom, herodotus, of, halicarnassus, and, polyaenus, claim, finally, defeated, the, cimmerians, in, polyaenus, account, of, the, defeat, of, the, cimmerians, he, claimed, that, alyattes, used, war, dogs, to, expel, them, from, asia, minor, with, the, term, war, dogs, being, a, greek, folkloric, reinterpretation, of, young, scythian, warriors, who, following, the, indo, european, passage, rite, of, the, k, ryos, would, ritually, take, on, the, role, of, wolf, or, dog, warriors, scythian, power, in, west, asia, thus, reached, its, peak, under, madyes, with, the, territories, ruled, by, the, scythians, extending, from, the, halys, river, in, anatolia, in, the, west, to, the, caspian, sea, and, the, eastern, borders, of, media, in, the, east, and, from, transcaucasia, in, the, north, to, the, northern, borders, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, in, the, south, a, scythian, group, might, have, left, media, and, migrated, into, the, region, between, the, don, and, volga, rivers, near, the, sea, of, azov, in, the, north, caucasus, during, this, period, in, the, 7th, century, bc, after, which, they, merged, with, maeotians, who, had, a, matriarchal, culture, and, formed, the, sauromatian, tribe, by, the, 620s, bc, the, neo, assyrian, empire, began, unravelling, after, the, death, of, ashurbanipal, in, 631, bc, in, addition, to, internal, instability, within, assyria, itself, babylon, revolted, against, the, assyrians, in, 626, bc, under, the, leadership, of, nabopolassar, and, the, next, year, in, 625, bc, cyaxares, the, son, of, phraortes, and, his, successor, to, the, median, kingship, overthrew, the, scythian, yoke, over, the, medes, by, inviting, the, scythian, rulers, to, a, banquet, and, then, murdering, them, all, including, madyes, after, getting, them, drunk, shortly, after, madyes, s, assassination, some, time, between, 623, and, 616, bc, the, scythians, took, advantage, of, the, power, vacuum, created, by, the, crumbling, of, the, power, of, their, former, assyrian, allies, and, overran, the, levant, this, scythian, raid, into, the, levant, reached, as, far, south, as, palestine, and, was, foretold, by, the, judahite, prophets, jeremiah, and, zephaniah, as, a, pending, disaster, from, the, north, which, they, believed, would, result, in, the, destruction, of, jerusalem, but, jeremiah, was, discredited, and, in, consequence, temporarily, stopped, prophetising, and, lost, favour, with, the, judahite, king, josiah, when, the, scythian, raid, did, not, affect, jerusalem, and, or, judah, the, scythian, expedition, instead, reached, up, to, the, borders, of, egypt, where, their, advance, was, stopped, by, the, marshes, of, the, nile, delta, after, which, the, pharaoh, psamtik, i, met, them, and, convinced, them, to, turn, back, by, offering, them, gifts, the, scythians, retreated, by, passing, through, the, philistine, city, of, ascalon, largely, without, any, incident, although, some, stragglers, looted, the, temple, of, a, tart, in, the, city, which, was, considered, to, be, the, most, ancient, of, all, temples, to, that, goddess, as, a, result, of, which, the, perpetrators, of, this, sacrilege, and, their, descendants, were, allegedly, cursed, by, a, tart, with, a, female, disease, due, to, which, they, became, a, class, of, transvestite, diviners, called, the, anarya, meaning, unmanly, in, scythian, according, to, babylonian, records, around, 615, bc, the, scythians, were, operating, as, allies, of, cyaxares, and, the, medes, in, their, war, against, assyria, with, the, scythians, abandonment, of, their, alliance, with, assyria, to, instead, side, with, the, babylonians, and, the, medes, being, a, critical, factor, in, worsening, the, position, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, and, the, scythians, participated, in, the, medo, babylonian, conquests, of, a, ur, in, 614, bc, nineveh, in, 612, bc, and, arran, in, 610, bc, which, permanently, destroyed, the, neo, assyrian, empire, the, presence, of, scythian, style, arrowheads, at, locations, where, the, neo, babylonian, empire, is, known, to, have, conducted, military, campaigns, and, which, are, associated, with, the, destruction, layers, of, these, campaigns, suggests, that, certain, contingents, composed, of, scythians, or, of, medes, who, had, adopted, scythian, archery, techniques, might, have, recruited, by, the, neo, babylonian, army, during, this, war, these, contingents, participated, in, the, battle, of, carchemish, in, 605, bc, while, clay, figurines, depicting, scythian, riders, as, well, as, an, ionian, shield, and, a, neo, hittite, battle, axe, similar, to, those, found, in, scythian, remains, in, the, pontic, steppe, suggest, that, actual, scythian, mercenaries, had, also, participated, at, the, final, neo, babylonian, victory, over, the, egyptians, at, carchemish, the, scythian, or, scythian, style, contingents, also, participated, in, the, neo, babylonian, campaigns, in, the, southern, levant, including, in, the, babylonian, annexation, of, the, kingdom, of, judah, in, 586, bc, the, rise, of, the, medes, and, their, empire, allowed, them, to, finally, expel, the, scythians, from, west, asia, in, the, c, 600s, bc, after, which, beginning, in, the, later, 7th, and, lasting, throughout, much, of, the, 6th, century, bc, the, majority, of, the, scythians, migrated, from, ciscaucasia, into, the, pontic, steppe, which, became, the, centre, of, scythian, power, the, inroads, of, the, cimmerians, and, the, scythians, into, west, asia, over, the, course, of, the, 8th, to, 6th, centuries, bc, had, destabilised, the, political, balance, which, had, prevailed, in, the, region, between, the, states, of, assyria, urartu, mannaea, and, elam, on, one, side, and, the, mountaineer, and, tribal, peoples, on, the, other, resulting, in, the, destruction, of, these, former, kingdoms, and, their, replacement, by, new, powers, including, the, kingdoms, of, the, medes, and, of, the, lydians, some, splinter, scythian, groups, nevertheless, remained, in, west, asia, in, the, southeast, caucasus, and, settled, in, transcaucasia, especially, the, area, corresponding, to, modern, day, azerbaijan, in, eastern, transcaucasia, due, to, which, the, area, where, they, lived, and, which, corresponded, to, the, core, regions, of, the, former, west, asian, scythian, realm, was, called, saka, ayana, meaning, land, inhabited, by, the, saka, i, e, scythians, by, the, medes, after, they, had, annexed, this, region, to, their, empire, the, median, name, for, this, territory, was, later, recorded, by, titus, livius, under, the, form, of, sacassani, and, as, sakas, n, by, ptolemy, while, the, country, was, called, the, land, of, the, skyth, noi, by, xenophon, one, such, splinter, group, joined, the, medes, and, participated, in, the, median, conquest, of, urartu, with, scythian, arrowheads, having, been, found, in, the, destruction, layers, of, the, urartian, fortresses, of, argi, ti, inili, and, tei, ebani, which, were, conquered, by, the, medes, around, c, 600, bc, one, group, formed, a, kingdom, in, what, is, now, azerbaijan, under, median, overlordship, but, eventually, hostilities, broke, out, between, some, of, them, and, cyaxares, due, to, which, they, left, transcaucasia, and, fled, to, lydia, by, the, middle, of, the, 6th, century, bc, the, scythians, who, had, remained, in, west, asia, had, completely, assimilated, culturally, and, politically, into, median, society, and, no, longer, existed, as, a, distinct, group, meanwhile, other, transcaucasian, scythian, splinter, groups, later, retreated, northwards, to, join, the, west, asian, scythians, who, had, already, previously, moved, into, the, kuban, steppe, after, their, expulsion, from, west, asia, and, beginning, in, the, later, 7th, and, lasting, throughout, much, of, the, 6th, century, bc, the, majority, of, the, scythians, including, the, royal, scythians, migrated, into, the, kuban, steppe, in, ciscaucasia, around, 600, bc, and, from, ciscaucasia, into, the, pontic, steppe, which, became, the, centre, of, scythian, power, although, herodotus, of, halicarnassus, claimed, that, the, scythians, retreated, into, the, northern, pontic, region, through, crimea, archaeological, evidence, instead, suggests, that, the, royal, scythians, migrated, northwards, into, western, ciscaucasia, and, from, there, into, the, country, of, those, scythians, who, had, previously, established, themselves, in, the, pontic, steppe, some, of, the, scythian, groups, who, had, settled, in, the, eastern, pontic, steppe, to, the, east, of, the, dnipro, river, were, displaced, by, the, arrival, of, the, royal, scythians, from, west, asia, and, they, moved, north, into, the, region, of, the, forest, steppe, zone, outside, of, the, pontic, scythian, kingdom, itself, these, groups, formed, the, tribes, of, the, androphagi, budini, and, melanchlaeni, during, this, early, phase, of, the, pontic, scythian, kingdom, the, hold, of, the, royal, scythians, on, the, western, part, of, the, steppe, located, to, the, west, of, the, dnipro, was, light, and, they, were, largely, satisfied, with, the, tribute, they, levied, on, the, sedentary, agriculturist, population, of, the, region, meanwhile, the, tribe, of, the, aroteres, which, consisted, of, a, settled, thracian, population, over, which, ruled, an, iranic, scythian, ruling, class, imported, greek, pottery, jewellery, and, weapons, in, exchange, of, agricultural, products, and, in, turn, offered, them, in, tribute, to, their, scythian, overlords, however, the, country, of, the, alazones, tribe, appears, to, have, become, poorer, during, this, time, in, the, early, 6th, century, bc, when, many, of, the, rebuilt, pre, scythian, settlements, in, their, territory, were, destroyed, by, the, royal, scythians, arriving, from, west, asia, in, crimea, the, royal, scythians, took, over, most, of, the, territory, up, to, the, cimmerian, bosporus, in, the, east, in, western, ciscaucasia, where, the, scythians, were, not, large, in, number, enough, to, spread, throughout, the, region, they, instead, took, over, the, steppe, to, the, south, of, the, kuban, river, s, middle, course, where, they, reared, large, herds, of, horses, it, was, at, this, time, that, the, scythians, brought, the, knowledge, of, working, iron, which, they, had, acquired, in, west, asia, with, them, and, introduced, it, into, the, pontic, steppe, whose, peoples, were, still, bronze, age, societies, until, then, some, west, asian, blacksmiths, might, also, have, accompanied, the, scythians, during, their, nortwards, retreat, and, become, employed, by, scythian, kings, after, which, the, practice, of, ironworking, soon, spread, to, the, neighbouring, populations, during, this, period, the, tribe, of, the, royal, scythians, would, primarily, bury, their, dead, at, the, edges, of, the, territories, they, occupied, especially, in, the, western, cisaucasian, region, instead, of, within, the, steppe, region, that, was, the, centre, of, their, kingdom, due, to, this, several, scythian, kurgan, nekropoleis, were, located, in, ciscaucasia, with, some, of, them, being, significantly, wealthy, and, belonging, to, aristocrats, or, royalty, and, the, royal, scythians, burials, in, the, kuban, steppe, were, the, most, lavish, of, all, scythian, funerary, monuments, during, the, early, scythian, period, during, the, early, 6th, century, bc, the, some, groups, of, transcaucasian, scythians, migrating, northwards, would, arrive, into, the, pontic, steppe, to, reinforce, the, royal, scythians, who, had, already, arrived, there, meanwhile, the, median, lydian, egyptian, and, neo, babylonian, empires, that, the, scythians, had, interacted, with, during, their, stay, in, west, asia, were, replaced, at, this, time, by, the, persian, achaemenid, empire, founded, by, the, persian, cyrus, ii, the, persians, were, an, iranic, people, just, like, the, scythians, and, the, medes, and, during, the, early, phase, of, the, achaemenid, empire, their, society, still, preserved, many, archaic, iranic, aspects, which, they, had, in, common, with, the, scythians, the, formation, of, the, achaemenid, empire, appears, to, have, pressured, the, scythians, into, remaining, to, the, north, of, the, black, sea, soon, after, during, the, early, scythian, period, itself, the, centre, of, power, of, the, royal, scythians, shifted, from, the, eastern, pontic, steppe, to, the, north, west, in, the, country, of, the, aroteres, tribe, where, was, located, the, main, industrial, centre, of, scythia, and, which, corresponded, to, the, country, of, gerrhos, which, was, located, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, country, of, the, aroteres, on, the, boundary, of, the, steppe, and, the, forest, steppe, during, this, period, the, royal, scythians, buried, their, dead, in, the, country, of, gerrhos, at, this, time, there, were, close, links, between, the, new, political, centre, of, scythia, in, gerrhos, and, the, greek, colony, of, pontic, olbia, and, members, of, the, royal, family, often, visited, this, city, during, this, period, the, scythians, were, ruled, by, a, succession, of, kings, whose, names, were, recorded, by, herodotus, of, halicarnassus, at, the, time, of, idanthyrsus, and, possibly, later, the, scythians, were, ruled, by, a, triple, monarchy, with, sk, pasis, and, taxakis, ruling, alongside, idanthyrsus, scopasis, was, himself, the, king, of, the, sauromatians, who, maintained, peaceful, relations, with, the, scythians, with, a, long, road, starting, in, scythia, and, continuing, towards, the, eastern, regions, of, asia, existing, thanks, to, these, friendly, relations, in, 513, bc, the, king, darius, i, of, the, persian, achaemenid, empire, carried, out, a, campaign, against, the, pontic, scythians, in, response, the, scythian, king, idanthyrsus, summoned, the, kings, of, the, peoples, surrounding, his, kingdom, to, a, meeting, to, decide, how, to, deal, with, the, persian, invasion, the, kings, of, the, budini, gelonians, and, sarmatians, agreed, to, help, the, scythians, against, the, persian, attack, while, the, kings, of, the, agathyrsi, androphagi, melanchlaeni, neuri, and, tauri, refused, to, support, the, scythians, when, the, armies, of, the, scythians, fled, to, the, territories, of, their, neighbours, in, front, of, the, advancing, persian, army, the, agathyrsi, refused, to, provide, refuge, to, the, scythians, which, forced, them, to, retreat, back, into, their, own, territory, darius, s, invasion, was, resisted, by, idanthyrsus, sk, pasis, and, taxakis, with, the, scythians, refusing, to, fight, an, open, battle, against, the, well, organised, achaemenid, army, and, instead, resorting, to, partisan, warfare, and, goading, the, persian, army, deep, into, scythian, territory, the, persian, army, might, have, crossed, the, don, river, and, reached, the, territory, of, the, sauromatians, where, darius, built, fortifications, but, resumed, their, pursuit, when, the, scythian, forces, returned, the, results, of, this, campaign, were, also, unclear, with, the, persian, inscriptions, themselves, referring, to, the, sak, tayaiy, paradraya, the, saka, who, dwell, beyond, the, black, sea, that, is, to, the, scythians, as, having, been, conquered, by, darius, while, greek, authors, instead, claimed, that, darius, campaign, failed, and, from, then, onwards, developed, a, tradition, of, idealising, the, scythians, as, being, invincible, thanks, to, their, nomadic, lifestyle, although, the, scythians, and, the, persians, were, both, iranic, peoples, related, to, each, other, the, greeks, tended, to, perceive, the, scythians, as, being, savage, nomads, whom, they, associated, with, the, thracians, while, they, saw, the, persians, as, a, civilised, sedentary, people, whom, they, associated, with, the, assyrians, and, babylonians, therefore, the, ancient, greeks, saw, the, persian, invasion, of, scythia, as, a, clash, between, savagery, represented, by, the, scythians, and, civilisation, represented, by, the, persians, over, the, course, of, the, late, 6th, century, bc, the, scythians, had, progressively, lost, their, territories, in, the, kuban, region, to, another, nomadic, iranic, people, the, sauromatians, beginning, with, the, territory, to, the, east, of, the, laba, river, and, then, the, whole, kuban, territory, by, the, end, of, the, 6th, century, bc, the, scythians, had, lost, their, territories, in, the, kuban, steppe, and, had, been, forced, to, retreat, into, the, pontic, steppe, except, for, its, westernmost, part, which, included, the, taman, peninsula, where, the, scythian, sindi, tribe, formed, a, ruling, class, over, the, native, maeotians, due, to, which, this, country, was, named, sindica, by, the, 5th, century, bc, sindica, was, the, only, place, in, the, caucasus, where, the, scythian, culture, survived, after, losing, their, territories, in, the, kuban, steppe, in, the, late, 6th, century, bc, the, scythians, had, been, forced, to, fully, retreat, into, the, pontic, steppe, and, the, royal, scythians, centre, of, power, within, scythia, shifted, to, the, south, in, the, region, of, the, bend, of, the, dnipro, where, the, site, of, kamianka, became, the, principal, industrial, centre, of, scythia, with, the, sedentary, population, of, the, city, being, largely, metal, workers, who, smelted, bog, iron, ores, into, iron, that, was, made, into, tools, simple, ornaments, and, weapons, for, the, agricultural, population, of, the, dnipro, valley, and, of, other, regions, of, scythia, and, the, city, itself, was, the, most, prominent, supplier, of, iron, and, bronze, products, to, the, nomadic, scythians, the, city, of, kamianka, also, became, the, capital, of, the, scythian, kings, whose, headquarters, were, located, in, the, further, fortified, acropolis, of, the, city, at, the, same, time, a, wave, of, sauromatian, nomads, from, the, lower, volga, steppe, in, the, east, immigrated, into, scythia, over, the, course, of, 550, and, 500, bc, and, were, absorbed, by, the, pontic, scythians, with, whom, they, mingled, a, large, number, of, settlements, in, the, valleys, of, the, steppe, rivers, were, destroyed, as, a, result, of, these, various, migratory, movements, the, retreat, of, the, scythians, from, the, kuban, steppe, and, the, arrival, of, the, sauromatian, immigrants, into, the, pontic, steppe, over, the, course, of, the, late, 6th, to, early, 5th, centuries, bc, caused, significant, material, changes, in, the, scythian, culture, soon, after, the, persian, campaign, changes, which, are, not, attributable, to, a, normal, autochthonous, evolution, some, of, the, changes, were, derived, from, the, sauromatian, culture, of, the, volga, steppe, while, others, originated, among, the, kuban, scythians, thus, resulting, in, the, sudden, appearance, within, the, lower, dnipro, region, of, a, fully, formed, scythian, culture, with, no, local, forerunners, and, which, included, a, notable, increase, in, the, number, of, scythian, funerary, monuments, the, scythians, underwent, tribal, unification, and, political, consolidation, in, reaction, to, the, persian, invasion, and, the, names, of, kings, who, ruled, over, the, scythians, the, 5th, century, bc, are, known, although, it, is, unknown, whether, these, kings, were, ruling, only, the, western, regions, of, scythia, located, between, the, danube, and, pontic, olbia, or, over, all, the, scythians, the, scythians, also, became, more, active, and, aggressive, around, this, time, possibly, as, a, result, of, the, arrival, of, the, new, sauromatian, nomadic, elements, from, the, east, or, out, of, necessity, to, resist, persian, expansionism, this, change, manifested, itself, through, the, consolidation, of, the, dominant, position, of, the, royal, scythians, over, the, other, tribes, within, scythia, and, through, the, royal, scythians, hold, on, the, western, part, of, their, realm, to, the, west, of, the, dnipro, where, lived, the, agriculturist, populations, becoming, heavier, and, more, oppressive, and, the, scythians, may, also, have, gained, access, to, the, wallachian, and, moldavian, plains, at, this, time, although, oltenia, and, parts, of, moldavia, were, instead, occupied, by, the, agathyrsi, another, result, of, the, changes, within, scythia, during, this, period, was, increased, scythian, expansionism, one, of, the, target, areas, of, scythian, expansionism, was, thrace, where, the, scythians, seem, to, have, established, a, permanent, presence, to, the, south, of, the, danube, at, an, early, point, with, the, greek, cities, of, kallatis, and, dionysupolis, in, the, area, corresponding, to, the, present, day, dobruja, both, being, surrounded, by, scythian, territory, and, in, 496, or, 495, bc, the, scythians, raided, the, thracian, territories, far, to, the, south, of, the, danube, till, the, thracian, chersonese, on, the, hellespont, as, an, attempt, to, secure, themselves, from, persian, encroachment, the, emergence, of, the, thracian, odrysian, kingdom, during, the, 5th, century, bc, soon, blocked, the, scythian, advances, in, thrace, and, the, scythians, established, friendly, contacts, with, the, odrysians, with, the, danube, river, being, set, as, the, common, border, between, the, two, kingdoms, and, a, daughter, of, the, odrysian, founder, king, t, r, s, i, marrying, the, scythian, king, ariapeithes, these, friendly, relations, also, saw, the, scythians, and, thracians, adopting, aspects, of, each, other, s, art, and, lifestyles, however, at, some, point, in, the, 5th, century, bc, the, agathyrsian, king, spargapeithes, treacherously, killed, the, scythian, king, ariapeithes, in, the, north, and, north, west, scythian, expansionism, manifested, itself, through, the, destruction, of, the, fortified, settlements, of, the, forest, steppe, and, the, subjugation, of, its, population, in, the, south, the, scythians, tried, to, impose, their, rule, over, the, greek, colonies, on, the, northern, shores, of, the, black, sea, the, greek, settlement, of, kremnoi, at, taganrog, on, the, lower, reaches, of, the, don, river, which, was, the, only, greek, colony, in, that, area, had, already, been, destroyed, by, the, scythians, between, 550, and, 525, bc, and, owing, to, the, scythians, necessity, to, continue, commerce, with, the, greeks, was, replaced, by, a, scythian, settlement, at, yelizavetovskaya, which, became, the, principal, trade, station, between, the, greeks, and, the, scythians, in, this, region, although, the, relations, between, the, scythians, and, the, greek, cities, of, the, northern, pontic, region, had, until, then, been, largely, peaceful, and, the, cities, previously, had, no, defensive, walls, and, possessed, unfortified, rural, settlements, in, the, area, new, hostile, relations, developed, between, these, two, parties, and, during, the, 490s, bc, fortifications, were, built, in, many, pontic, greek, cities, whose, kh, rai, were, abandoned, or, destroyed, while, burials, of, men, killed, by, scythian, type, arrowheads, appeared, in, their, nekropoleis, between, 450, and, 400, bc, kerkinitis, was, paying, tribute, to, the, scythians, the, scythians, were, eventually, able, to, successfully, impose, their, rule, over, the, greek, colonies, in, the, north, western, pontic, shores, and, in, western, crimea, including, niconium, tyras, pontic, olbia, and, kerkinitis, and, the, close, relations, between, pontic, olbia, and, the, scythian, political, centre, ended, at, this, time, the, hold, of, the, scythians, over, the, western, part, of, the, pontic, region, thus, became, firmer, during, the, 5th, century, bc, with, the, scythian, king, scyles, having, a, residence, in, the, greek, city, of, pontic, olbia, which, he, would, visit, each, year, while, the, city, itself, experienced, a, significant, influx, of, scythian, inhabitants, during, this, period, and, the, presence, of, coins, of, scyles, issued, at, niconium, in, the, dnister, valley, attesting, of, his, control, over, this, latter, city, this, in, turn, allowed, the, scythians, to, participate, in, indirect, relations, with, the, city, of, athens, in, greece, proper, which, had, established, contacts, in, crimea, the, destruction, of, the, greek, cities, kh, rai, and, rural, settlements, however, also, meant, that, they, lost, their, grain, producing, hinterlands, with, the, result, being, that, the, scythians, instituted, an, economic, policy, under, their, control, whereby, the, sedentary, peoples, of, the, forest, steppe, to, their, north, became, the, primary, producers, of, grain, which, was, then, transported, through, the, southern, buh, and, dnipro, rivers, to, the, greek, cities, to, their, south, such, as, tyras, niconium, and, pontic, olbia, from, where, the, cities, exported, it, to, mainland, greece, at, a, profit, for, themselves, the, scythians, were, less, successful, at, conquering, the, greek, cities, in, the, region, of, the, cimmerian, bosporus, where, although, they, were, initially, able, to, take, over, nymphaeum, the, other, cities, built, or, strengthened, city, walls, banded, together, into, an, alliance, under, the, leadership, of, panticapaeum, and, successfully, defended, themselves, after, which, they, united, into, the, bosporan, kingdom, at, the, same, time, the, scythians, sent, a, diplomatic, mission, to, sparta, in, greece, proper, with, the, goal, of, establishing, a, military, alliance, against, the, achaemenid, empire, ancient, greek, authors, claim, that, the, spartans, started, drinking, undiluted, wine, which, they, called, the, scythian, fashion, of, drinking, wine, because, of, these, contacts, after, scyles, coins, minted, in, pontic, olbia, were, minted, in, the, name, of, eminakos, who, was, either, a, governor, of, the, city, for, scyles, s, brother, and, successor, octamasadas, or, a, successor, of, octamasadas, around, the, same, time, there, were, inner, conflicts, within, the, scythian, kingdom, and, a, new, wave, of, sauromatian, immigrants, arrived, into, scythia, around, c, 400, bc, which, destabilised, it, and, ended, scythian, military, activity, against, the, greek, cities, of, the, pontic, shore, scythian, control, of, the, greek, cities, ended, sometime, between, 425, and, 400, bc, and, the, cities, started, reconstituting, their, kh, rai, and, pontic, olbia, regained, control, over, the, territory, it, occupied, during, the, archaic, period, and, expanded, it, while, tyras, and, niconium, also, restored, their, hinterlands, the, scythians, lost, control, of, nymphaeum, which, became, part, of, the, bosporan, kingdom, that, had, itself, been, expanding, its, territories, within, the, asian, side, of, the, cimmerian, bosporus, with, the, arrival, of, a, new, wave, of, sauromatian, immigrants, the, royal, scythians, and, their, allied, tribes, moved, to, the, western, parts, of, scythia, and, expanded, into, the, areas, to, the, south, of, the, danube, corresponding, to, modern, bessarabia, and, bulgaria, and, they, established, themselves, in, the, dobruja, region, one, of, the, scythian, kings, who, ruled, during, the, later, 5th, century, bc, was, buried, in, a, sumptuously, furnished, kurgan, located, at, agighiol, during, the, early, 4th, century, bc, the, scythian, kingdom, of, the, pontic, steppe, reached, its, peak, in, the, 4th, century, bc, at, the, same, time, when, the, greek, cities, of, the, coast, were, prospering, and, the, relations, between, the, two, were, mostly, peaceful, some, scythians, had, already, started, becoming, sedentary, farmers, and, building, fortified, and, unfortified, settlements, around, the, lower, reaches, of, the, dnipro, river, since, the, late, 5th, century, bc, and, this, process, intensified, throughout, the, 4th, century, bc, with, the, nomadic, scythians, settling, in, multiple, villages, in, the, left, bank, of, the, dnister, estuary, and, in, small, settlements, on, the, lower, banks, of, the, dnipro, and, of, the, small, steppe, rivers, which, were, favourable, for, agriculture, at, the, same, time, the, scythians, sold, furs, fish, and, grain, to, the, greeks, in, exchange, of, wine, olive, oil, and, luxury, goods, while, there, was, high, demand, for, the, scythians, exports, done, through, the, greek, colonies, such, as, trade, goods, grain, slaves, and, fish, due, to, which, the, relations, between, the, pontic, and, aegean, regions, and, most, especially, with, athens, were, thriving, the, importation, of, greek, products, by, the, forest, steppe, peoples, had, instead, decreased, since, the, 5th, century, bc, and, the, scythians, captured, territories, from, them, in, the, area, around, what, is, presently, boryspil, during, this, time, although, the, greek, cities, of, the, coast, extended, their, territories, considerably, this, did, not, infringe, on, the, scythians, who, still, possessed, abundant, pastures, and, whose, settlements, were, still, thriving, with, archaeological, evidence, suggesting, that, the, population, of, crimea, most, of, whom, were, scythians, during, this, time, increased, by, 600, the, rule, of, the, spartocid, dynasty, in, the, bosporan, kingdom, was, also, favourable, for, the, scythians, under, the, rules, of, leukon, i, spartocus, ii, and, paerisades, i, with, leucon, employing, scythians, in, his, army, and, the, bosporan, nobility, had, contacts, with, the, scythians, which, might, have, included, matrimonial, relations, between, scythian, and, bosporan, royalty, by, the, 4th, century, bc, the, bosporan, kingdom, became, the, main, supplier, of, grains, to, greece, partly, because, of, the, peloponnesian, war, that, ragied, in, the, latter, region, which, intensified, the, grains, trade, between, the, scythians, and, the, greeks, with, the, scythians, becoming, the, principal, middlemen, in, the, supply, of, grains, to, the, bosporan, kingdom, while, most, of, the, grains, that, the, scythians, sold, to, the, greeks, was, produced, by, the, agricultural, populations, in, the, northern, forest, steppe, the, scythians, themselves, were, also, trying, to, produce, more, grains, within, scythia, itself, which, was, a, driving, force, behind, the, sedentarisation, of, many, of, the, hitherto, nomadic, scythians, the, process, of, scythian, sedentarisation, thus, was, most, intense, in, the, regions, adjacent, to, the, bosporan, cities, in, eastern, crimea, the, scythian, royalty, and, aristocracy, obtained, enormous, profits, from, this, grains, trade, and, this, period, saw, scythian, culture, not, only, thriving, with, most, known, scythian, monuments, dating, from, then, but, also, rapidly, undergoing, significant, hellenisation, the, city, of, the, kamianka, site, remained, the, political, industrial, and, commercial, capital, of, scythian, during, the, 4th, and, early, 3rd, centuries, bc, during, which, time, the, scythians, founded, a, new, settlement, at, yelizavetovskaya, which, functioned, as, the, main, administrative, commercial, and, industrial, centre, of, the, lower, don, river, and, northern, lake, maeotis, areas, and, was, also, the, residence, of, local, scythian, lords, the, main, burial, centre, of, the, scythians, during, this, period, was, located, in, the, nikopol, and, zaporizhzhia, region, on, the, lower, dnipro, where, were, located, the, solokha, chortomlyk, krasnokutsk, and, oleksandropil, kurgans, rich, burials, such, as, for, example, the, chortomlyk, mohyla, attest, of, the, wealth, acquired, from, the, grains, trade, by, the, scythian, aristocracy, of, the, 4th, century, bc, who, were, progressively, buried, with, more, relatives, retainers, and, grave, goods, such, as, gold, and, silver, objects, including, greek, manufactured, toreutics, and, jewellery, the, scythian, commoners, however, did, not, obtain, any, revenue, from, this, trade, and, luxury, items, are, absent, from, their, burials, despite, the, pressure, of, some, smaller, and, isolated, sarmatian, groups, in, the, east, the, period, remained, largely, and, unusually, peaceful, and, the, scythian, hegemony, in, the, pontic, steppe, remained, undisturbed, with, the, scythian, nomads, continuing, to, form, the, bulk, of, the, northern, pontic, region, s, population, the, most, famous, scythian, king, of, the, 4th, century, bc, was, ateas, who, was, the, successor, and, possibly, the, son, of, the, scythian, king, buried, at, agighiol, and, whose, rule, started, around, the, 360s, bc, by, this, period, scythian, tribes, had, already, settled, permanently, on, the, lands, to, the, south, of, the, danube, where, the, people, of, ateas, lived, with, their, families, and, their, livestock, and, possibly, in, ludogorie, as, well, and, at, this, time, both, crimea, and, the, dobruja, region, started, being, called, little, scythia, ancient, greek, latin, scythia, minor, although, ateas, had, united, the, scythian, tribes, under, his, rule, into, a, rudimentary, state, and, he, still, ruled, over, the, traditional, territories, of, the, scythian, kingdom, of, the, pontic, steppe, until, at, least, crimea, around, 350, bc, he, had, also, permanently, seized, some, of, the, lands, on, the, right, bank, of, the, danube, from, the, thracian, getae, and, it, appears, that, he, was, largely, based, in, the, region, to, the, south, of, the, danube, under, ateas, the, greek, cities, to, the, south, of, the, danube, had, also, come, under, scythian, hegemony, including, kallatis, over, which, he, held, control, and, where, he, probably, issued, his, coins, further, attesting, of, the, power, that, the, scythians, held, to, the, south, of, the, danube, in, his, time, ateas, s, main, activities, which, were, centred, in, thrace, and, south, west, scythia, such, as, his, wars, against, the, thracian, triballi, and, the, dacian, histriani, and, his, threat, of, conquest, against, byzantium, which, might, be, another, possible, location, for, where, ateas, minted, his, coins, ateas, initially, allied, with, philip, ii, of, macedonia, but, eventually, this, alliance, fell, apart, and, war, broke, out, between, scythia, and, macedonia, over, the, course, of, 340, to, 339, bc, ending, with, the, death, of, ateas, at, about, 90, years, old, and, the, capture, of, the, scythians, camp, and, the, 20, 000, women, and, children, and, more, than, 2, 000, pedigree, horses, living, there, the, scythians, appear, to, have, lost, some, territories, on, both, sides, of, the, danube, due, to, ateas, s, defeat, and, death, with, the, getae, moving, to, the, north, across, the, danube, and, settling, in, the, lands, between, the, dnipro, and, the, prut, rivers, although, these, changes, did, not, affect, scythian, power, the, scythians, still, continued, to, nomadise, and, bury, their, dead, in, rich, kurgans, in, the, areas, to, the, north, west, of, the, black, sea, between, the, dnipro, and, the, prut, the, scythian, capital, of, the, kamianka, site, continued, to, exist, as, prosperously, and, extensively, as, it, had, before, the, defeat, of, ateas, and, the, scythian, aristocracy, continued, burying, their, dead, in, barrow, tombs, which, were, as, sumptuous, as, those, of, ateas, s, time, in, 331, or, 330, bc, the, scythians, were, able, to, defeat, an, invasion, force, of, 30, 000, men, led, against, them, and, the, getae, by, alexander, iii, s, lieutenant, zopyrion, and, which, had, managed, to, attain, and, besiege, pontic, olbia, with, zopyrion, himself, getting, killed, during, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, bc, the, scythians, were, militarily, defeated, by, a, king, of, macedonia, again, this, time, by, lysimachus, in, and, 313, bc, after, this, the, scythians, experienced, another, military, defeat, when, their, king, agaros, participated, in, the, bosporan, civil, war, in, 309, bc, on, the, side, of, satyros, ii, son, of, paerisades, i, after, satyros, ii, was, defeated, and, killed, his, son, paerisades, fled, to, agaros, s, realm, the, aftermath, of, the, scythian, conflict, with, macedon, also, coincided, with, climatic, changes, and, economic, crises, caused, by, overgrazed, pastures, producing, an, unfavorable, period, for, the, scythians, and, following, their, setbacks, against, the, macedonians, the, scythians, came, under, pressure, from, the, celts, the, thracian, getae, and, the, germanic, bastarnae, from, the, west, at, this, same, time, beginning, in, the, late, 4th, century, bc, another, related, nomadic, iranic, people, the, sarmatians, moved, from, the, east, into, the, pontic, steppe, where, their, smaller, yet, more, active, groups, overwhelmed, the, more, numerous, yet, sedentary, scythians, and, took, over, the, scythians, pastures, this, deprived, the, scythians, of, their, most, important, resource, causing, the, collapse, of, scythian, power, and, as, a, consequence, scythian, culture, suddenly, disappeared, from, the, north, of, the, pontic, sea, in, the, early, 3rd, century, bc, during, the, 3rd, century, bc, the, celts, and, bastarnae, displaced, the, balkan, scythians, the, protogenes, inscription, written, sometime, between, 220, and, 200, bc, records, that, the, scythians, and, the, sarmatian, thisamatae, and, saudaratae, tribes, sought, shelter, from, the, allied, forces, of, the, celts, and, the, germanic, sciri, due, to, the, sarmatian, getic, celtic, and, germanic, encroachments, the, scythian, kingdom, came, to, an, end, and, the, scythian, kurgans, disappeared, from, the, pontic, region, replaced, as, the, dominant, power, of, the, pontic, steppe, by, the, sarmatians, while, sarmatia, europea, european, sarmatia, replaced, scythia, as, the, name, for, the, region, around, 200, bc, after, their, final, defeat, by, the, sarmatian, roxolani, the, remnants, of, the, scythians, left, their, centre, at, kamianka, and, fled, to, the, scythia, minors, in, crimea, and, in, dobrugea, as, well, as, in, nearby, regions, their, population, living, in, limited, fortified, enclaves, the, settlements, of, those, scythians, remaining, on, the, pontic, were, located, in, the, lower, reaches, of, the, dnieper, river, these, scythians, were, no, longer, nomadic, having, become, sedentary, hellenised, farmers, and, by, the, second, century, bc, these, were, the, only, places, the, scythians, could, still, be, found, by, 50, to, 150, ad, most, of, the, scythians, had, been, assimilated, by, the, sarmatians, the, remaining, scythians, of, crimea, who, had, mixed, with, the, tauri, and, the, sarmatians, were, conquered, in, the, 3rd, century, ad, by, the, goths, and, other, germanic, tribes, who, were, then, migrating, from, the, north, into, the, pontic, steppe, and, who, destroyed, scythian, neapolis, in, subsequent, centuries, remaining, scythians, and, sarmatians, were, largely, assimilated, by, early, slavs, the, scythians, and, sarmatians, played, an, instrumental, role, in, the, ethnogenesis, of, the, ossetians, who, are, considered, direct, descendants, of, the, alans, the, graeco, roman, peoples, were, profoundly, fascinated, by, the, scythians, this, fascination, endured, in, europe, even, after, both, the, disappearance, of, the, scythians, and, the, end, of, graeco, roman, culture, and, continued, throughout, classical, and, late, antiquity, and, the, middle, ages, lasting, till, the, 18th, century, in, the, modern, period, the, ancient, greek, historian, herodotus, of, halicarnassus, wrote, legendary, accounts, of, the, arrival, of, the, scythians, into, the, lands, of, the, cimmerians, accounts, for, which, evidence, is, lacking, by, the, 5th, century, bc, the, image, of, the, scythians, in, athens, had, become, the, quintessential, stereotype, used, for, barbarians, that, is, for, non, greeks, following, the, greeks, caricatural, representation, of, foreigners, as, being, unmoderated, drinkers, they, moreso, associated, the, scythians, with, drunkenness, later, graeco, roman, tradition, transformed, the, scythian, prince, anacharsis, into, a, legendary, figure, as, a, kind, of, noble, savage, who, represented, barbarian, wisdom, due, to, which, the, ancient, greeks, included, him, as, one, of, the, seven, sages, of, greece, consequently, anacharsis, became, a, popular, figure, in, greek, literature, and, many, legends, arose, about, him, including, claims, that, he, had, been, a, friend, of, solon, eventually, anacharsis, completely, became, an, ideal, man, of, nature, or, noble, savage, figure, in, greek, literature, as, well, as, favourite, figure, of, the, cynics, who, ascribed, to, him, a, 3rd, century, bc, work, titled, the, letters, of, anacharsis, the, 4th, century, bc, greek, historian, ephorus, of, cyme, used, the, perception, of, anacharsis, as, a, personification, of, barbarian, wisdom, to, create, an, idealised, image, of, the, scythians, being, as, an, invincible, people, which, became, a, tradition, of, greek, literature, ephorus, created, a, fictitious, account, of, a, legendary, scythian, king, named, idanthyrsos, or, iandysos, who, 1500, years, before, the, reign, of, the, mythical, first, assyrian, king, ninus, and, 3000, years, before, the, first, olympiad, allegedly, defeated, the, equally, legendary, pharaoh, sesostris, and, became, the, ruler, of, all, asia, this, story, was, a, continuation, of, ephorus, of, cyme, s, idealisation, of, the, scythians, as, an, invincible, people, and, was, drawn, from, herodotus, of, halicarnassus, s, accounts, of, the, scythian, invasion, of, asia, and, the, campaign, of, darius, in, scythia, in, the, 4th, century, bc, the, athenian, politician, aeschines, referred, to, the, scythian, ancestry, of, his, opponent, demosthenes, to, attempt, discrediting, him, the, ancient, greeks, included, the, scythians, in, their, mythology, with, herodorus, of, heraclea, making, a, mythical, scythian, named, teutarus, into, a, herdsman, who, served, amphitryon, and, taught, archery, to, heracles, herodorus, also, portrayed, the, titan, prometheus, as, a, scythian, king, and, by, extension, described, prometheus, s, son, deucalion, as, a, scythian, as, well, the, ancient, israelites, called, the, scythians, a, k, z, and, this, name, corrupted, to, a, k, n, z, appears, in, the, hebrew, bible, where, a, k, n, z, is, closely, linked, to, g, mer, that, is, to, the, cimmerians, the, richness, of, scythian, burials, was, already, well, known, in, antiquity, and, by, the, time, the, power, of, the, scythians, came, to, an, end, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, the, robbing, of, scythian, graves, started, and, was, initially, carried, out, by, scythians, themselves, the, romans, confused, the, peoples, whom, they, perceived, as, archetypical, barbarians, namely, the, scythians, and, the, celts, into, a, single, grouping, whom, they, called, the, celto, scythians, latin, celtoscythae, and, supposedly, living, from, gaul, in, the, west, to, the, pontic, steppe, in, the, east, during, late, antiquity, itself, another, wave, of, grave, robbery, of, scythian, burials, occurred, at, the, time, of, the, sarmatian, and, hunnish, domination, of, the, pontic, steppe, when, these, peoples, reused, older, scythian, kurgans, to, bury, their, own, dead, in, late, antiquity, itself, as, well, as, in, and, the, middle, ages, the, name, scythians, was, used, in, greco, roman, and, byzantine, literature, for, various, groups, of, nomadic, barbarians, living, on, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, who, were, not, related, to, the, actual, scythians, such, as, the, huns, goths, ostrogoths, gokturks, pannonian, avars, slavs, and, khazars, for, example, byzantine, sources, referred, to, the, rus, raiders, who, attacked, constantinople, in, 860, ad, in, contemporary, accounts, as, tauroscythians, because, of, their, geographical, origin, and, despite, their, lack, of, any, ethnic, relation, to, scythians, following, the, christianisation, of, europe, the, view, that, the, peoples, of, this, continent, originated, in, west, asia, as, the, descendants, of, japheth, became, the, normative, historiography, at, the, same, time, drawing, on, the, classical, authors, lumping, together, of, the, ancient, celts, and, scythians, under, the, label, of, barbarians, whereby, these, peoples, who, were, the, other, for, the, graeco, romans, were, pictured, as, sharing, traits, and, resemble, each, other, in, how, strange, they, were, the, various, cultures, of, northern, europe, started, claiming, ancestry, from, the, celto, scythians, and, adopted, the, graeco, roman, vision, of, the, barbarity, of, ancient, peoples, of, europe, as, legitimate, records, of, their, own, ancient, cultures, in, this, context, the, similarity, of, the, name, scythia, with, the, latin, name, of, the, irish, scotti, led, to, the, flourishing, of, speculations, of, a, scythian, ancestry, of, the, irish, as, recorded, in, the, historia, brittonum, of, nennius, and, consequently, the, 8th, century, text, the, auraicept, na, n, ces, claimed, that, a, scythian, named, f, nius, farsaid, lit, irishman, the, pharisee, presided, over, 27, scholars, using, the, best, parts, of, the, new, confused, languages, at, babel, to, create, the, irish, language, drawing, on, the, confusion, of, the, scotti, with, both, scythia, and, the, picti, as, well, as, on, the, late, antique, conceptualisation, of, scythia, as, a, typical, barbarian, land, which, had, persisted, into, the, middles, ages, bede, in, the, 8th, century, itself, invented, a, scythian, origin, for, the, picts, in, his, historia, ecclesiastica, gentis, anglorum, the, irish, mythological, text, titled, the, lebor, gab, la, renn, repeated, this, legend, and, claimed, that, these, supposed, scythian, ancestors, of, the, irish, had, been, invited, to, egypt, because, the, pharaoh, admired, how, nel, the, son, of, f, nius, was, knowledgeable, on, the, world, s, many, languages, with, nel, marrying, the, pharaoh, s, daughter, scota, according, to, the, lebor, gab, la, renn, the, scythians, fled, from, egypt, when, the, pharaoh, drowned, after, moses, parted, the, red, sea, during, the, flight, of, the, israelites, and, went, back, to, scythia, and, from, there, to, ireland, via, africa, and, spain, while, nel, s, and, scota, s, son, go, del, glas, became, the, eponym, the, gaelic, people, little, is, known, of, the, situation, of, scythian, tombs, during, the, mediaeval, period, when, turkic, tribes, had, moved, into, the, regions, formerly, inhabited, by, the, scythians, although, the, earliest, recorded, cases, of, scythian, burials, being, robbed, date, from, the, 15th, century, bc, drawing, on, the, biblical, narrative, and, the, graeco, roman, conflation, of, the, scythians, and, celts, early, modern, european, scholars, believed, that, the, celts, were, scythians, who, were, descended, from, japheth, s, son, magog, and, that, they, were, related, to, the, gauls, whom, they, believed, were, descended, from, japheth, s, other, son, gomer, it, therefore, became, popular, among, pseudohistorians, of, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, who, drew, on, this, historiography, to, claim, that, the, irish, people, were, the, truest, inheritors, of, scythian, culture, so, as, both, to, distinguish, and, denigrate, irish, culture, during, the, early, modern, era, itself, colonial, ethnographers, used, the, narrative, of, herodotus, of, halicarnassus, to, create, an, image, of, the, scythians, as, a, notorious, and, savage, people, chauvinistically, attached, to, their, own, customs, and, opposed, to, outside, influences, fascinated, by, this, imagery, these, ethnographers, drew, on, it, to, claim, populations, who, were, completely, unrelated, to, the, scythians, such, as, the, irish, tatars, mongols, turks, and, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, as, being, alleged, descendants, of, the, scythians, while, claims, of, scythian, and, japhethic, ancestry, in, much, of, europe, were, abandoned, during, the, reformation, and, renaissance, british, works, on, ireland, continued, to, emphasise, the, alleged, scythian, ancestry, of, the, irish, to, confirm, their, barbaric, nature, these, endeavours, were, further, reinforced, by, 17th, century, proto, linguistic, hypotheses, about, scytho, celtic, languages, and, enjoyed, enthusiastic, popularity, during, the, 18th, century, until, these, origin, hypotheses, were, finally, discredited, by, early, 19th, century, advances, in, philology, and, by, the, discovery, of, features, common, to, the, cultures, of, the, ancient, continental, celts, and, the, irish, during, the, early, modern, period, itself, hungarian, scholars, identified, the, hungarians, with, the, huns, and, claimed, that, they, descended, from, scythians, therefore, the, image, of, the, scythians, among, hungarians, was, shaped, into, one, of, noble, savages, who, were, valorous, and, honest, uncouth, and, hostile, to, western, refinement, but, at, the, same, time, defended, christian, civilisation, from, aggression, from, the, east, such, as, from, the, pechenegs, cumans, and, tatars, in, the, middle, ages, and, from, the, ottomans, in, the, early, modern, period, this, view, was, later, superseded, by, the, now, established, scientific, consensus, that, the, hungarians, are, a, finno, ugric, people, the, 17th, century, irish, historian, roderick, o, flaherty, continued, the, claim, of, the, lebor, gab, la, renn, that, the, irish, descended, from, the, scythians, in, his, history, of, ireland, titled, ogygia, seu, rerum, hibernicarum, chronologia, etc, in, which, he, identified, f, nius, farsaid, with, the, figure, of, phoenix, who, in, greek, mythology, was, believed, to, have, created, the, phoenician, alphabet, o, flaherty, elaborated, on, this, by, claiming, that, f, nius, farsaid, also, invented, the, ogham, script, as, well, as, the, early, greek, alphabet, from, which, the, latin, alphabet, evolved, large, scale, robbery, of, scythian, tombs, started, when, the, russian, empire, started, occupying, the, pontic, steppe, in, the, 18th, century, in, 1718, the, russian, tsar, peter, i, issued, decrees, overseeing, the, collection, of, right, old, and, rare, objects, to, saint, petersburg, in, exchange, for, compensation, and, the, material, thus, obtained, became, the, basis, of, the, saint, petersburg, state, hermitage, museum, s, collection, of, scythian, gold, this, resulted, in, significant, grave, robbery, of, scythian, burials, due, to, which, most, of, the, scythian, tombs, of, the, russian, empire, had, been, sacked, by, 1764, in, the, 18th, to, 20th, centuries, the, racialist, british, israelist, movement, developed, a, pseudohistory, according, to, which, after, population, of, the, historical, kingdom, of, israel, had, been, deported, by, the, neo, assyrian, empire, in, 721, bc, and, became, the, ten, lost, tribes, they, fled, to, the, north, to, the, region, near, sinope, from, where, they, migrated, into, east, and, central, europe, and, became, the, scythians, and, cimmerians, who, themselves, moved, to, north, west, europe, and, became, the, supposed, ancestors, of, the, white, protestant, peoples, of, northern, europe, being, an, antisemitic, movement, british, israelists, claim, to, be, the, most, authentic, heirs, of, the, ancient, israelites, while, rejecting, jews, as, being, contaminated, through, intermarriage, with, edomites, or, adhere, to, the, antisemitic, conspiracy, theory, claiming, that, jews, descend, from, the, khazars, according, to, the, scholar, tudor, parfitt, the, proof, cited, by, adherents, of, british, israelism, is, of, a, feeble, composition, even, by, the, low, standards, of, the, genre, in, the, 19th, century, scythian, kurgans, in, ukraine, kuban, and, crimea, had, been, looted, so, that, by, the, 20th, century, more, than, 85, of, scythian, kurgans, excavated, by, archaeologists, had, already, been, pillaged, the, grave, robbers, of, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, were, experienced, enough, that, they, almost, always, found, the, burial, chambers, of, the, tombs, and, stole, the, treasures, contained, within, them, in, the, later, 19th, century, a, cultural, movement, called, skifstvo, russian, lit, scythianism, emerged, in, russia, whose, members, unreservedly, referred, to, themselves, and, to, russians, as, a, whole, as, skify, russian, lit, scythians, closely, affiliated, to, the, left, socialist, revolutionaries, the, skify, were, a, movement, of, russian, nationalist, religious, mysticists, who, saw, russia, as, a, sort, of, messiah, like, figure, who, would, usher, in, a, new, historical, era, of, the, world, and, their, identification, with, the, ancient, scythians, was, a, positive, acceptance, of, dostoevsky, s, view, that, europe, had, always, seen, russians, as, being, asiatic, the, skify, therefore, used, this, image, to, distinguish, russia, from, the, west, although, they, nevertheless, did, not, see, russia, as, being, a, part, of, asia, and, their, ideas, were, instead, a, revival, of, the, old, conceptualisation, of, russia, as, being, the, bridge, linking, europe, and, asia, the, culmination, of, skifstvo, was, the, famous, poem, written, in, 1918, by, aleksandr, blok, titled, skify, russian, lit, the, scythians, in, which, he, presented, scythia, that, is, russia, as, being, different, from, the, rest, of, asia, while, also, being, closer, to, europe, in, skify, blok, depicted, russia, as, a, barrier, between, the, warring, races, of, europe, and, asia, and, he, made, use, of, the, racist, yellow, peril, ideology, by, threatening, that, russia, was, capable, of, stopping, its, protection, of, europe, and, allow, east, asians, to, overrun, it, the, scholar, adrienne, mayor, hypothesised, over, the, course, of, 1993, to, 2011, that, the, legend, of, the, griffin, originated, among, the, scythians, who, came, across, fossilised, skeletons, of, the, dinosaur, protoceratops, in, mongolia, while, mining, for, gold, and, retold, this, discovery, to, the, ancient, greeks, who, interpreted, them, as, mythical, beings, thus, creating, the, myth, of, the, griffin, this, hypothesis, was, contested, in, 2016, by, the, palaeontologist, mark, p, witton, who, demonstrated, that, the, imagery, of, the, griffin, originated, in, early, bronze, age, west, asia, and, was, transmitted, from, there, into, ancient, greek, art, during, the, orientalising, period, the, imagery, of, griffins, in, scythian, art, itself, was, borrowed, from, the, artistic, traditions, of, west, asia, and, ancient, greece, since, the, scythians, did, not, have, a, written, language, their, non, material, culture, can, only, be, pieced, together, through, writings, by, non, scythian, authors, parallels, found, among, other, iranic, peoples, and, archaeological, evidence, scythian, archaeology, can, be, divided, into, three, stages, archaeological, remains, of, the, scythians, include, kurgan, tombs, ranging, from, simple, exemplars, to, elaborate, royal, kurgans, containing, the, scythian, triad, of, weapons, horse, harness, and, scythian, style, wild, animal, art, gold, silk, and, animal, sacrifices, in, places, also, with, suspected, human, sacrifices, mummification, techniques, and, permafrost, have, aided, in, the, relative, preservation, of, some, remains, scythian, archaeology, also, examines, the, remains, of, cities, and, fortifications, the, scythians, spoke, a, language, belonging, to, the, scythian, languages, most, probably, a, branch, of, the, eastern, iranic, languages, whether, all, the, peoples, included, in, the, scytho, siberian, archaeological, culture, spoke, languages, from, this, family, is, uncertain, the, scythian, languages, may, have, formed, a, dialect, continuum, scytho, sarmatian, in, the, west, and, scytho, khotanese, or, saka, in, the, east, the, scythian, languages, were, mostly, marginalised, and, assimilated, as, a, consequence, of, the, late, antiquity, and, early, middle, ages, slavic, and, turkic, expansion, the, western, sarmatian, group, of, ancient, scythian, survived, as, the, medieval, language, of, the, alans, and, eventually, gave, rise, to, the, modern, ossetian, language, scythian, society, was, constituted, of, kinship, structures, where, clan, groups, formed, the, basis, of, the, community, and, of, political, organisation, clan, elders, wielded, considerable, power, and, were, able, to, depose, kings, such, as, when, the, scythian, army, overthrew, the, king, scyles, and, the, scythians, demanded, his, extradition, from, the, thracians, after, which, he, was, executed, following, the, deposition, of, scyles, the, power, of, both, the, king, and, the, warrior, aristocracy, became, further, entrenched, as, an, extension, of, clan, based, relations, a, custom, of, blood, brotherhood, existed, among, the, scythians, whereby, the, blood, of, the, sworn, blood, brothers, was, poured, in, a, cup, of, wine, in, which, their, swords, arrows, battle, aces, and, spears, were, lowered, before, they, drank, it, the, scythians, were, furthermore, organised, into, tribes, which, were, themselves, headed, by, local, lords, these, tribes, were, subject, to, the, dominant, tribe, of, the, royal, scythians, who, formed, the, tribal, aristocracy, of, the, scythians, and, whose, ruling, lord, was, the, king, of, all, scythians, the, scythians, were, composed, of, a, number, of, tribal, units, including, in, addition, to, the, scythians, themselves, as, well, as, the, thracians, who, had, inhabited, the, region, since, the, bronze, age, the, population, of, the, pontic, scythian, kingdom, consisted, of, greeks, living, in, colonies, on, the, northern, shore, of, the, black, sea, there, were, few, differences, between, the, many, scythian, tribes, and, tribal, groupings, in, the, early, period, of, the, pontic, scythian, kingdom, which, later, became, more, pronounced, as, these, eventually, conquered, various, native, populations, the, neighbours, of, the, scythians, included, the, scythians, were, closely, related, to, other, iranic, nomads, who, occupied, the, eurasian, steppe, during, antiquity, such, as, scythian, society, was, stratified, along, class, lines, herodotus, of, halicarnassus, named, the, three, classes, of, scythians, only, once, in, his, writings, where, he, described, them, as, descended, from, the, three, sons, of, the, scythian, ancestor, god, targitaos, the, scythian, aristocracy, were, property, owners, who, possessed, landed, estates, large, enough, that, it, sometimes, took, a, whole, day, to, ride, around, them, these, freeborn, scythian, rulers, used, the, whip, as, their, symbol, the, commoners, were, free, but, still, depended, to, some, extent, on, the, aristocracy, they, were, allowed, to, own, some, property, usually, a, pair, of, oxen, needed, to, pull, a, cart, hence, why, they, were, called, oktapodes, ancient, greek, lit, eight, feeters, in, greek, by, the, 4th, century, bc, the, exploitation, of, these, free, commoners, became, the, main, economic, policy, of, scythia, serfs, belonged, to, the, poorest, sections, of, the, native, populations, of, scythia, and, being, tied, to, the, land, and, not, possessing, cattle, they, were, not, free, and, did, not, own, cattle, or, wagons, stablemen, and, farmers, were, recruited, from, the, serf, class, a, rudimentary, form, of, slavery, was, also, practised, in, scythia, and, the, scythian, ruling, class, used, a, large, number, of, slaves, to, till, the, land, and, tend, to, the, cattle, slaves, were, also, assigned, to, the, production, of, dairy, products, the, greek, author, herodotus, of, halicarnassus, claimed, that, the, scythians, used, to, blind, their, slaves, to, prevent, them, from, eating, the, most, valuable, of, these, dairy, products, he, also, claimed, that, the, scythian, kings, considered, the, inhabitants, of, crimea, to, be, their, slaves, this, class, structure, thus, existed, in, a, hierarchy, where, the, farmer, peasant, class, occupied, the, lowest, social, position, the, clergy, occupied, the, middle, position, and, warrior, aristocracy, occupied, the, highest, social, position, and, dominated, the, other, two, classes, with, the, scythian, kings, belonging, to, this, dominant, class, the, class, stratification, of, scythian, society, corresponded, to, a, hierarchy, of, social, standing, and, property, ownership, which, is, visibly, in, how, export, of, the, grain, cultivated, by, the, common, freemen, profited, only, the, aristocracy, but, not, these, commoners, whose, graves, lacked, the, lavish, furnishing, of, the, aristocratic, burials, this, drastic, difference, between, the, aristocracy, and, the, commoners, is, also, visible, in, how, scythian, art, only, represented, the, interested, of, the, scythian, ruling, classes, scythian, society, was, a, patriarchal, one, where, women, were, subordinate, to, men, although, women, from, the, upper, classes, were, free, to, ride, horses, while, women, from, the, lower, classes, may, have, not, been, free, to, do, so, and, may, have, spent, most, of, their, time, indoors, among, the, more, nomadic, tribes, the, women, and, children, spent, most, of, their, time, indoors, in, the, wagons, polygamy, was, practised, among, the, scythian, upper, classes, and, kings, had, harems, in, which, both, local, women, and, women, who, had, been, bought, lived, some, of, these, women, were, the, kings, legal, wives, and, others, were, their, concubines, reflecting, the, patriarchal, structure, of, scythian, society, the, wives, and, concubines, could, be, passed, down, as, inheritance, as, when, the, scythian, king, scyles, married, opoea, who, had, been, one, of, his, father, s, wives, women, were, likely, in, charge, of, tending, the, herds, and, organising, the, livelihood, when, the, men, were, away, to, fight, within, scythian, priesthood, there, existed, a, group, of, transgender, soothsayers, called, the, anarya, lit, unmanly, who, were, born, and, lived, their, early, lives, as, men, and, later, in, their, lives, assumed, the, mannerisms, and, social, roles, role, of, women, the, scythians, were, monarchical, and, the, king, of, all, the, scythians, was, the, main, tribal, chief, who, was, from, the, dominant, tribe, of, the, royal, scythians, power, among, the, scythian, kings, was, passed, down, a, single, dynasty, and, the, historian, and, anthropologist, anatoly, khazanov, has, suggested, that, the, scythians, had, been, ruled, by, the, same, dynasty, from, the, time, of, their, stay, in, west, asia, until, the, end, of, their, kingdom, in, the, pontic, steppe, the, scythologist, askold, ivantchik, has, instead, proposed, that, the, scythians, had, been, ruled, by, at, least, three, dynasties, including, that, of, bartatua, that, of, spargapeithes, and, that, of, ariapeithes, although, the, kings, powers, were, limited, by, the, popular, and, warrior, assemblies, royal, power, itself, was, held, among, the, scythians, to, be, divinely, ordained, this, conception, of, royal, power, which, is, well, documented, in, the, ritual, symbols, depicted, on, 5th, to, 3rd, century, bc, scythian, toreutics, was, initially, foreign, to, scythian, culture, and, originated, in, west, asia, during, the, period, of, scythian, presence, there, in, the, 7th, century, bc, the, scythian, kings, were, later, able, to, further, increase, their, position, through, the, concentration, of, economic, power, in, their, hands, because, of, their, dominance, of, the, grains, trade, with, the, greeks, which, made, them, and, the, scythian, warrior, aristocracy, as, a, whole, very, wealthy, after, their, death, the, scythian, kings, were, buried, along, with, one, or, some, of, their, wives, the, kings, also, chose, servants, cupbearers, courtiers, and, members, of, the, royal, entourage, from, the, tribes, under, his, authority, who, were, to, be, killed, and, buried, along, with, him, to, follow, and, serve, him, in, the, afterlife, warriors, belonging, to, the, entourage, of, scythian, rulers, were, also, buried, in, smaller, and, less, magnificent, tombs, surrounding, the, tombs, of, the, rulers, by, the, 4th, century, bc, the, scythian, kingdom, had, developed, into, a, rudimentary, state, after, the, king, ateas, had, united, all, the, scythian, tribes, under, his, personal, authority, the, scythians, were, organised, into, popular, and, warrior, assemblies, that, limited, the, power, of, the, kings, the, gatherings, of, these, assemblies, were, held, in, the, nomes, such, as, the, one, at, which, the, overthrow, of, the, king, scyles, was, decided, the, scythians, were, ruled, by, a, triple, monarchy, with, a, high, king, who, ruled, all, of, the, scythian, kingdom, and, two, younger, kings, who, ruled, in, sub, regions, the, kingdom, was, in, turn, made, of, nomes, headed, by, local, lords, the, peoples, of, scythian, consisted, of, a, mix, of, sedentary, farmer, populations, and, nomads, and, the, tribes, living, in, the, steppes, remained, primarily, nomadic, with, their, lifestyle, and, customs, were, inextricably, linked, to, their, nomadic, way, of, life, with, the, tribe, of, the, royal, scythians, initially, leading, a, transhumant, pastoralist, nomadic, way, of, life, between, the, 9th, and, 5th, centuries, bc, the, climate, in, the, steppes, was, cool, and, dry, which, was, a, catalyst, for, the, emergence, of, equestrian, nomadic, pastoralism, in, the, northern, pontic, region, the, climate, became, warmer, and, wetter, during, the, 5th, century, bc, so, that, it, was, more, wet, and, damp, compared, to, present, day, ukraine, which, allowed, the, steppe, nomads, to, move, into, the, steppes, proper, and, led, the, ancient, greeks, to, see, this, region, as, damp, and, foggy, in, these, favourable, climatic, conditions, the, ranges, of, beavers, and, elk, extended, further, south, than, presently, with, beavers, then, being, present, in, the, lower, dnipro, and, lower, southern, buh, river, valleys, and, elk, living, until, the, environs, of, olbia, and, the, bones, both, these, animals, have, been, found, in, kitchen, refuse, dating, from, the, scythian, period, with, the, integration, of, scythia, with, the, greek, colonies, on, the, northern, shore, of, the, black, sea, the, scythians, soon, became, involved, in, activities, such, as, cultivating, grain, fishing, trading, and, craftsmanship, due, to, which, they, had, already, started, becoming, semi, nomads, and, sedentary, farmers, by, the, 5th, century, bc, and, they, had, largely, become, settled, farmers, by, the, 3rd, century, bc, being, equestrian, nomads, the, scythians, excelled, at, horsemanship, and, scythian, men, spent, most, of, their, lives, on, horseback, the, scythians, reared, a, small, but, very, swift, breed, of, horse, that, they, rode, directly, and, also, used, for, drawing, carts, graeco, roman, authors, claimed, that, the, scythians, and, sarmatians, would, castrate, their, horses, because, they, were, otherwise, too, turbulent, to, handle, the, saddle, was, invented, by, the, scythians, in, the, 7th, century, bc, and, consisted, of, two, felt, cushions, stuffed, with, stag, hair, and, mounted, on, felt, sweatbands, in, some, cases, the, cushions, were, attached, to, wooden, saddle, frames, placed, to, their, back, and, front, scythian, saddles, had, four, raised, bolsters, at, each, corner, which, at, a, time, when, the, stirrup, had, not, yet, been, invented, allowed, the, riders, to, lean, into, the, forward, bolsters, and, raise, themselves, without, being, encumbered, by, the, bouncing, of, their, running, horses, scythian, saddles, very, colourful, and, dyed, in, red, yellow, dark, blue, black, and, white, they, were, also, wholly, decorated, with, wool, appliqu, leather, and, felt, as, well, as, wooden, carvings, decorated, in, gold, leaf, thanks, to, the, propitious, climate, then, prevailing, to, the, north, of, the, black, sea, grass, grew, abundantly, on, the, treeless, steppe, which, permitted, the, nomadic, scythians, to, rear, large, herds, of, cattle, and, horses, the, society, of, the, scythians, was, therefore, highly, based, on, nomadic, pastoralism, which, was, practised, by, both, the, sedendary, and, nomadic, scythian, tribes, with, their, herds, being, made, up, of, about, 40, horses, 40, cattle, and, 18, sheep, but, no, pigs, which, the, scythians, refused, to, keep, in, their, lands, horse, rearing, was, especially, an, important, part, of, scythian, life, not, only, because, the, scythians, rode, them, but, also, because, horses, were, a, source, of, food, the, strong, reliance, of, the, scythians, on, pastoralism, itself, ensured, the, self, sufficiency, of, the, scythians, and, was, conducive, towards, the, nomadic, lifestyle, this, importance, of, pastoralism, for, the, scythians, is, visible, in, how, representations, of, pastoral, activities, formed, the, predominant, theme, of, scythian, petroglyphic, art, scythian, women, tended, the, herds, while, men, were, engaged, in, fighting, hunting, among, the, scythians, was, primarily, done, for, sport, and, entertainment, rather, than, for, procuring, meat, although, it, was, occasionally, also, carried, out, for, food, conditions, in, the, southern, lands, near, the, shores, of, the, black, sea, such, as, in, hylaea, and, the, valleys, further, north, along, the, dnipro, were, propitious, for, agriculture, and, for, cultivating, cereals, orchards, and, vineyards, this, allowed, the, scythians, to, in, addition, of, being, principally, reliant, on, domesticated, animals, also, complement, their, source, of, food, with, agriculture, and, the, scythian, upper, classes, owned, large, estates, in, which, large, numbers, of, slaves, and, members, of, the, tribes, subordinate, to, the, royal, scythians, were, used, to, till, the, land, and, rear, cattle, among, these, subordinate, tribes, the, sedendary, scythian, tribes, of, the, callipidae, aroteres, georgoi, and, alizones, engaged, in, agriculture, and, grew, crops, for, their, own, use, as, well, as, to, be, exported, to, the, greeks, on, the, northern, shores, of, the, black, sea, these, tribes, were, able, to, cultivate, large, quantities, of, crops, thanks, to, the, use, of, the, plough, the, ancient, greek, author, herodotus, of, halicarnassus, recorded, that, these, sedendary, scythian, tribes, grew, wheat, barley, millet, lentils, beans, onions, and, garlic, and, an, oven, used, to, dry, grains, of, wheat, barley, and, rye, was, located, at, the, site, of, shyroka, balka, near, pontic, olbia, the, callipidae, cultivated, crops, including, wheat, and, millet, and, also, engaged, in, animal, husbandry, and, fishing, at, sea, the, scythians, ate, the, meat, from, the, horses, cattle, and, sheep, they, reared, milk, especially, that, of, mares, was, also, an, important, part, of, the, scythians, diet, and, it, was, both, consumed, and, used, to, make, cheese, and, an, alcoholic, drink, made, from, milk, similar, to, the, kumys, still, widely, consumed, by, eurasian, steppe, nomads, the, scythians, also, supplemented, to, varying, extents, depending, on, the, regions, where, they, lived, their, diets, by, hunting, deer, steppe, antelopes, beavers, and, other, wild, animals, as, well, as, by, fishing, from, the, large, rivers, flowing, through, scythia, in, addition, to, these, the, scythians, consumed, large, amounts, of, wine, which, they, bought, from, the, greeks, unlike, the, greeks, who, diluted, wine, with, water, before, drinking, it, the, scythians, drank, it, undiluted, due, to, which, undiluted, wine, was, called, scythian, style, wine, among, the, greeks, who, also, equated, the, drinking, of, wine, in, the, scythian, way, with, immoderate, and, unrestrained, binge, drinking, during, the, earlier, phase, of, the, scythian, pontic, kingdom, wine, was, primarily, consumed, by, the, aristocracy, and, its, consumption, became, more, prevalent, among, the, wealthier, members, of, the, populace, only, after, the, 5th, century, bc, scythian, garments, were, sewn, together, from, several, pieces, of, cloth, and, generally, did, not, require, the, use, of, fibulae, to, be, held, in, place, unlike, the, clothing, of, other, ancient, european, peoples, scythian,

of, soap, which, they, used, to, wash, their, heads, according, to, herodotus, of, halicarnassus, scythian, men, however, did, not, wash, their, bodies, with, water, and, instead, cleaned, themselves, in, a, steam, bath, in, a, small, tent, where, the, flower, buds, of, cannabis, were, thrown, on, hot, stones, to, induce, intoxication, scythian, women, used, a, paste, made, from, the, wood, of,

peoples, of, the, pontic, steppe, were, still, bronze, age, societies, until, the, 8th, century, bc, and, it, was, only, after, the, scythians, had, expanded, into, west, asia, that, they, acquired, knowledge, of, ironworking, which, they, then, brought, with, them, into, the, pontic, steppe, after, they, had, been, expelled, from, west, asia, around, c, 600, bc, the, scythians, had, practised, goldsmithing, from, an, early, date, with, remains, from, the, 2nd, kurgan, of, the, arzhan, burials, attesting, that, the, scythians, were, already, skilled, in, working, gold, before, their,

the, eurasian, steppe, nomads, and, represented, a, limited, and, specific, range, of, animals, in, very, specific, canonical, poses, the, animal, style, art, of, the, scythians, was, a, variant, of, the, art, of, the, eurasian, steppe, nomads, which, itself, initially, developed, in, eastern, eurasian, steppes, of, central, asia, and, siberia, during, the, 9th, century, bc, under, the, partial, influence, of, ancient, chinese, art, and, of, the, static, naturalistic, art, of, the, inhabitants, of, the, siberian, woodlands, after, which, it, arrived, westward, into, eastern, europe, during, the, 8th, century, bc, the, distinctive, style, of, art, characteristic, of, the, scythians, proper, emerged, during, their, stay, in, western, asia, during, the, 7th, century, bc, and, especially, during, their, occupation, of, media, when, the, scythian, upper, class, came, under, the, influence, of, west, asian, culture, as, a, consequence, of, which, the, art, of, the, scythians, absorbed, many, west, asian, motifs, and, themes, beginning, in, the, 5th, century, bc, scythian, art, experienced, the, influence, of, arriving, sauromatians, from, the, east, the, borrowing, of, elements, from, thracian, art, as, well, as, the, incorporation, of, elements, from, greek, and, achaemenid, persian, art, this, scythian, art, formed, out, of, various, influences, later, spread, to, the, west, in, the, region, which, corresponds, to, present, romania, and, eventually, it, brought, influences, from, iranic, and, west, asian, art, into, celtic, art, and, also, introduced, metalwork, types, which, followed, shang, chinese, models, such, as, cruciform, tubes, used, in, harnesses, into, western, eurasia, where, they, were, adopted, by, the, hallstatt, culture, scythian, art, stopped, existing, after, the, end, of, the, pontic, scythian, kingdom, in, the, early, 3rd, century, bc, and, the, art, of, the, later, scythians, of, crimea, and, dobruja, was, completely, hellenised, with, their, paintings, and, sculptures, belonging, to, the, greek, artistic, tradition, and, having, probably, been, made, by, greek, sculptors, the, centre, of, industry, during, the, early, scythian, period, was, located, in, the, region, of, the, tiasmyn, group, of, the, scythian, culture, which, corresponded, the, country, of, the, scythian, husbandsmen, where, an, iranic, scythian, elite, ruled, over, a, sedentary, thracian, population, by, the, middle, scythian, period, its, principal, centre, was, at, a, site, corresponding, to, present, day, kamianka, dniprovska, where, bog, iron, ores, were, smelted, to, produce, iron, and, various, tools, ornaments, and, weapons, were, made, blacksmiths, workshops, in, scythian, settlements, from, this, time, were, located, in, both, the, ground, level, and, pit, houses, where, they, formed, groups, of, craftsmen, s, quarters, among, the, various, scythian, tribes, the, sedentary, farmer, tribes, lived, in, western, scythia, between, the, danube, and, the, dnipro, while, the, nomadic, pastoralist, tribes, lived, in, eastern, scythia, between, the, dnipro, and, the, don, some, of, these, sedentary, farmers, later, moved, into, crimea, the, more, nomadic, scythians, lived, in, habitations, suited, for, nomadic, lifestyles, such, as, tents, of, the, same, type, as, the, more, recent, yurt, of, the, turkic, peoples, and, the, ger, of, the, mongolic, peoples, that, could, easily, be, assembled, and, disassembled, to, be, transported, to, different, locations, as, well, as, covered, wagons, that, functioned, as, tents, on, wheels, the, walls, and, floors, of, these, portable, habitations, were, made, of, felt, and, the, tents, themselves, were, bound, together, using, ropes, made, from, horse, hair, the, division, of, scythian, burial, chambers, into, weapon, arsenals, kitchen, areas, stables, and, living, rooms, for, the, deceased, family, members, and, their, servants, as, well, as, their, furnishings, were, modelled, on, the, habitations, in, which, the, scythians, dwelt, during, their, lives, at, the, site, of, shyroka, balka, near, pontic, olbia, the, local, inhabitants, built, square, and, round, pit, hute, before, this, region, was, hellenised, in, the, 6th, century, bc, beginning, in, the, 5th, and, 4th, centuries, bc, the, scythians, started, building, fortified, sedentary, settlements, the, most, important, of, these, was, the, settlement, of, kamyanka, which, was, protected, by, the, steep, banks, of, the, dnipro, river, on, one, side, and, by, ramparts, on, the, other, the, houses, of, the, scythian, upper, classes, which, were, built, from, stone, were, located, on, the, acropolis, of, kamyanka, and, have, yielded, significant, amounts, of, greek, pottery, and, imported, jewellery, the, houses, in, these, scythian, settlements, which, were, single, storeyed, and, had, gabled, roofs, were, built, from, wooden, beams, with, the, walls, being, made, of, beams, stuck, into, the, ground, and, covered, with, clay, while, felt, fabrics, were, placed, on, their, inside, their, sizes, ranged, from, 40, to, 150, metres, square, and, they, could, include, multiple, rooms, the, settlements, also, contained, square, pit, houses, made, of, wooden, posts, the, tripe, of, the, callipidae, lived, in, rammed, earth, houses, built, on, stone, foundations, located, in, open, settlements, and, earthworks, and, buried, their, dead, in, flat, graves, while, their, scythian, ruling, class, were, buried, in, kurgans, the, tribe, of, the, aroteres, were, organised, into, small, territorial, units, that, lived, in, open, undefended, settlements, and, strongholds, covering, between, 16, and, 24, hectares, with, the, largest, one, covering, 52, hectares, each, possessing, a, large, industrial, quarter, and, functioning, as, industrial, centres, the, large, number, of, aroteres, settlements, and, earthworks, suggests, that, they, formed, a, large, and, dense, population, in, the, black, earth, region, of, the, steppe, the, earthworks, of, the, aroteres, contained, within, them, kurgan, cemeteries, lasting, from, the, 6th, to, 3rd, centuries, that, each, included, up, to, 400, kurgans, where, their, inhabitants, were, buried, showing, that, their, settlements, also, had, dense, populations, the, religion, of, the, scythians, was, a, variant, of, the, pre, zoroastrian, iranic, religion, which, differed, from, zoroastrian, and, the, post, zoroastrian, iranic, religions, and, instead, belonged, to, a, more, archaic, stage, of, indo, iranic, religious, development, than, the, zoroastrian, and, hindu, systems, the, use, of, cannabis, to, induce, trance, and, divination, by, soothsayers, was, a, characteristic, of, the, scythian, belief, system, the, scythians, were, a, people, with, a, strong, warrior, culture, and, fighting, was, one, of, the, main, occupations, of, scythian, men, who, were, all, trained, in, war, exercises, and, in, archery, from, a, young, age, and, the, furnishings, of, scythian, burial, chambers, which, included, weapons, reflected, the, martial, nature, of, their, society, which, was, made, of, mounted, warriors, the, aroteres, were, an, especially, war, like, scythian, tribe, however, the, mostly, small, number, of, depictions, of, warfare, compared, to, the, larger, number, of, representations, of, peaceful, pastoralist, activities, in, scythian, petroglyphic, art, suggests, that, the, war, like, tendencies, of, the, scythians, might, have, been, exaggerated, by, herodotus, of, halicarnassus, and, the, modern, authors, who, drew, on, him, as, a, source, the, scythians, used, weapons, made, from, cast, iron, and, bronze, mounted, archery, was, the, main, form, of, scythian, warfare, scythian, saddles, had, four, raised, bolsters, at, each, corner, which, at, a, time, when, the, stirrup, had, not, yet, been, invented, allowed, the, riders, to, lean, into, the, forward, bolsters, and, raise, themselves, so, they, could, use, shoot, their, arrows, from, horseback, this, type, of, saddle, preserved, the, mounted, archer, from, the, bouncing, of, the, running, horses, thus, allowing, scythian, mounted, archers, to, operate, at, very, high, performance, levels, the, main, scythian, armament, were, the, bow, and, arrows, when, not, used, scythian, bows, and, arrows, were, kept, in, a, combined, quiver, bow, case, called, a, g, rytos, scythian, bows, and, arrows, might, have, required, the, use, of, thumb, rings, to, be, drawn, although, none, have, been, found, yet, possibly, because, hey, might, have, been, made, of, perishable, materials, the, scythians, coated, their, arrows, with, a, potent, poison, referred, to, in, greek, as, skythikon, to, prepare, this, poison, the, scythians, captured, small, adders, that, had, recently, given, birth, which, they, left, to, decompose, while, the, scythian, priests, filled, leather, bags, with, human, blood, and, buried, them, in, dung, to, putrefy, it, after, which, they, mixed, decomposed, matter, in, the, blood, with, the, decomposed, remains, of, the, snakes, in, addition, to, the, snakes, venom, retaining, its, effect, in, their, decomposed, bodies, the, human, blood, was, propitious, for, the, growth, of, bacterial, populations, such, as, tetanus, and, gangrene, causing, germs, from, the, dung, thus, if, an, individual, initially, survived, being, shot, with, a, poisoned, scythian, arrow, they, would, still, experience, the, effects, of, the, snake, poison, including, the, disintegration, of, blood, cells, shock, and, respiratory, paralysis, with, the, gangrening, of, the, wound, starting, the, next, day, followed, by, tetanus, after, around, a, week, the, skythikon, was, crafted, to, cause, lasting, harm, and, even, the, most, minor, wounds, from, arrows, coated, with, it, had, a, high, likeliness, to, be, lethal, and, the, unlikely, possible, survivors, of, skythikon, poisoning, would, have, been, incapacitated, for, life, the, skythikon, was, used, only, against, human, enemies, and, was, not, used, for, hunting, since, the, meat, of, animals, contaminated, with, the, toxins, would, not, have, been, proper, for, consumption, the, stench, of, the, skythikon, coated, arrows, also, functioned, as, stench, weapons, because, the, near, unanimous, revulsion, by, human, cultures, for, smell, of, rotting, and, faeces, and, the, belief, in, ancient, periods, that, such, foul, miasmas, caused, disease, another, poison, used, by, the, scythians, to, coat, their, arrows, was, hemlock, the, shafts, and, foreshafts, of, scythian, poisoned, arrows, were, painted, with, zigzag, and, diamond, patterns, emulating, the, scaly, designs, of, snake, skins, in, addition, to, the, bow, and, arrow, the, scythians, also, used, weapons, such, as, some, scythian, warriors, wore, rich, protective, armour, and, belts, made, of, metal, plates, including, the, scythians, used, small, hide, or, wicker, shields, reinforced, with, iron, strips, with, the, shields, of, scythian, aristocrats, often, being, decorated, with, decorative, central, plaques, the, high, king, had, the, supreme, authority, over, the, armies, of, the, royal, scythians, and, their, subordinate, tribes, the, local, lords, were, in, charge, of, the, army, of, a, nome, the, heads, of, clans, were, in, charge, of, war, bands, the, nomes, of, the, scythian, kingdom, were, in, charge, of, spreading, information, about, the, war, at, the, time, of, the, persian, invasion, of, scythia, mounted, archery, was, the, mode, of, fighting, of, the, free, commoners, of, scythia, who, were, called, hippotoxotai, ancient, greek, lit, horse, archers, in, greek, serfs, and, slaves, were, subordinate, to, the, warriors, and, accompanied, them, unarmed, and, would, be, armed, with, spears, only, in, extremely, severe, situations, the, scythians, had, several, war, related, customs, although, most, authors, have, tended, to, focus, on, the, scythians, warrior, culture, battle, and, fight, scenes, were, only, rarely, depicted, in, scytian, petroglyphic, art, where, depictions, of, wild, animals, and, peaceful, pastoral, activities, instead, predominated, the, pontic, scythians, practised, trade, extensively, with, the, substantial, trade, relations, existed, between, the, scythians, and, the, greeks, which, continued, the, long, established, exchanges, of, goods, between, the, northern, pontic, and, aegean, region, that, had, already, existed, since, the, 3rd, and, 2nd, millennia, bc, these, trade, relations, became, more, intense, after, the, greeks, established, colonies, on, the, shores, of, the, black, sea, as, a, consequence, of, which, the, scythians, engaged, in, trade, with, both, european, and, asian, greece, the, scythians, exported, grain, fish, honey, wax, skins, wood, horses, cattle, sheep, and, slaves, to, greece, as, well, as, beavers, and, beaver, skins, and, rare, furs, that, the, scythians, had, themselves, bought, from, the, populations, living, to, their, north, and, east, such, as, the, thyssagetae, and, iurcae, of, the, ural, mountains, who, hunted, rare, animals, and, sewed, their, skins, into, clothing, the, greeks, were, especially, interested, in, buying, scythian, horses, the, most, important, of, these, export, goods, was, grain, and, most, especially, wheat, with, the, scythians, on, the, lower, dnipro, river, cultivating, crops, principally, for, export, and, the, tribes, of, the, callipidae, the, aroteres, the, georgoi, and, the, alizones, selling, part, of, their, large, crop, yields, to, the, greeks, an, oven, used, to, dry, grain, such, as, wheat, barley, and, rye, was, located, at, shyroka, balka, the, relations, between, the, scythians, and, the, greek, colonies, became, more, hostile, in, the, early, 5th, century, bc, with, the, scythians, destroying, the, greek, cities, kh, rai, and, rural, settlements, and, therefore, their, grain, producing, hinterlands, the, result, was, that, the, scythians, instituted, an, economic, policy, under, their, control, whereby, the, sedentary, peoples, of, the, forest, steppe, to, their, north, became, the, primary, producers, of, grain, which, was, then, transported, through, the, buh, and, dnipro, rivers, to, the, greek, cities, to, their, south, such, as, tyras, niconium, and, pontic, olbia, from, where, the, cities, exported, it, to, mainland, greece, at, a, profit, for, themselves, beginning, in, the, 5th, century, bc, the, grain, trade, with, greece, was, carried, out, through, the, intermediary, of, the, bosporan, kingdom, due, to, which, the, scythians, expanded, their, agricultural, activities, to, the, areas, adjoining, the, bosporan, kingdom, including, in, crimea, resulting, in, some, of, the, sedentary, scythian, farmers, moving, into, crimea, so, as, to, cultivate, their, crops, in, close, proximity, to, these, clients, as, a, consequence, of, the, peloponnesian, war, the, bosporan, kingdom, became, the, main, supplier, of, grain, to, greece, in, the, 4th, century, bc, which, resulted, in, an, increase, of, the, trade, of, grain, between, the, scythians, and, the, bosporans, the, scythian, aristocracy, played, an, important, role, in, this, grain, trade, by, becoming, the, main, intermediary, in, providing, grain, obtained, both, through, from, the, agriculturalist, peoples, of, the, forest, steppe, and, cultivation, within, scythia, itself, to, the, bosporan, kingdom, the, scythian, aristocracy, was, the, main, beneficiary, of, these, commercial, activities, from, which, it, derived, immense, revenue, and, was, able, to, significantly, enrich, itself, hence, why, it, sought, to, increase, the, amount, of, grain, produced, in, scythia, the, rich, aristocratic, burials, richly, furnished, with, imported, grave, goods, and, gold, silver, objects, including, fine, greek, made, tauretic, and, jewellers, attest, of, the, scythian, aristocracy, s, economic, power, derived, from, the, grain, trade, due, to, which, the, coins, minted, by, scythian, kings, at, pontic, olbia, were, struck, with, depictions, of, ears, of, wheat, scythian, commoners, did, however, not, obtain, any, benefits, from, this, trade, and, luxury, goods, were, absent, from, their, tombs, inscriptions, from, the, greek, cities, on, the, northern, black, sea, coast, also, show, that, upper, class, greek, families, also, derived, wealth, from, this, trade, and, as, a, consequence, of, these, flourishing, trade, relations, which, were, themselves, possible, only, thanks, to, the, protection, and, cooperation, of, the, scythian, kings, the, greek, colonies, on, the, northern, shores, of, the, black, sea, rapidly, grew, during, the, 6th, century, bc, the, scythian, monopoly, over, the, trade, of, grain, imported, from, the, forest, steppe, to, the, greek, cities, came, to, an, end, sometime, between, 435, and, 400, bc, after, which, the, greek, cities, regaining, their, independence, and, rebuilding, their, kh, rai, the, grain, trade, between, the, scythians, and, the, greeks, declined, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, because, of, competition, from, wheat, imported, into, greece, from, egypt, and, due, to, the, collapse, of, scythian, agriculture, resulting, from, the, sarmatian, invasion, the, scythians, also, sold, slaves, to, the, greeks, with, the, slaves, to, be, sold, being, acquired, from, neighbouring, or, subordinate, tribes, during, military, campaigns, and, the, greek, colonies, on, the, northern, black, sea, coast, being, hubs, of, slave, trafficking, after, the, greek, city, state, of, athens, had, defeated, the, persians, at, salamis, in, 480, bc, it, bought, 300, scythian, slave, archers, who, acted, as, a, police, force, in, the, city, and, who, lived, in, tents, when, the, greek, city, of, mytilene, broke, away, from, the, delian, league, in, 428, bc, it, also, bought, a, similar, force, of, scythian, warriors, in, exchange, for, their, many, exports, the, scythians, bought, various, greek, products, especially, amphorae, of, wine, and, the, pottery, used, to, consume, said, wine, such, as, oinokhoai, and, kylikes, the, scythians, also, bought, olive, oil, perfumes, ointments, and, other, luxury, goods, from, the, greeks, beginning, in, the, 7th, and, 6th, centuries, bc, the, scythians, had, been, importing, luxuries, such, as, personal, ornaments, gold, and, silver, vases, carved, semi, precious, and, gem, stones, wine, oil, and, offensive, and, defensive, weapons, made, in, the, workshops, of, pontic, olbia, or, in, mainland, greece, as, well, as, pottery, made, by, the, greeks, of, the, aegean, islands, during, the, earlier, middle, scythian, period, of, the, 5th, century, bc, the, scythians, were, importing, corinthian, and, athenian, pottery, and, by, the, later, middle, scythian, period, of, the, 4th, to, 3rd, centuries, bc, the, market, for, pontic, olbia, was, limited, to, a, small, part, of, western, scythia, while, the, rest, of, the, kingdom, s, importations, came, from, the, bosporan, kingdom, especially, from, panticapaeum, from, where, came, most, of, scythia, s, imported, pottery, as, well, as, richly, decorated, fine, vases, rhyta, and, decorative, toreutic, plaques, for, g, rytoi, a, consequence, of, the, scythian, import, of, greek, manufactured, art, and, luxury, goods, was, that, greek, art, significantly, influenced, scythian, art, and, artistic, preferences, and, by, the, middle, and, late, scythian, periods, most, of, the, artwork, in, the, scythian, tombs, consisted, of, scythian, motifs, and, scenes, representing, scythian, life, which, had, been, done, by, greek, artisans, an, important, trade, route, existed, in, scythia, during, the, early, scythian, period, which, started, in, pontic, olbia, and, followed, the, course, of, the, inhul, river, and, crossed, the, dnipro, after, which, it, turned, east, until, the, country, of, the, gelonians, and, after, crossing, the, don, and, the, volga, passed, through, the, ural, mountains, and, continued, into, asia, until, the, altai, mountains, gold, was, traded, from, eastern, eurasia, until, pontic, olbia, through, this, route, and, the, scythian, tradesmen, went, to, the, distant, regions, on, its, course, to, carry, out, commerce, the, conquest, of, the, north, pontic, region, by, the, scythians, and, their, imposition, of, a, pax, scythica, created, the, conditions, of, safety, for, traders, which, enabled, the, establishment, of, this, route, olbian, made, goods, have, been, found, at, multiple, locations, lying, on, this, route, till, the, ural, mountains, this, trade, route, was, another, significant, source, of, revenue, for, the, scythian, rulers, and, its, location, also, provided, to, pontic, olbia, the, important, position, of, being, a, commercial, and, cultural, centre, in, the, northern, pontic, region, for, at, least, two, centuries, and, the, city, itself, maintained, friendly, relations, with, the, populations, neighbouring, it, although, the, scythians, adopted, the, use, of, coinage, as, a, method, of, payment, for, trade, with, the, greeks, they, never, used, it, for, their, own, domestic, market, the, scythians, looked, similar, to, the, populations, of, europe, and, depictions, of, scythian, men, in, persian, sculptures, and, scythian, gold, objects, show, them, as, stocky, and, powerfully, built, with, strong, facial, features, and, long, and, thick, wavy, hair, upper, class, scythians, were, particularly, tall, with, the, men, usually, being, over, 1, 80, metres, tall, and, sometimes, reaching, 1, 90, metres, and, on, some, rarer, occasions, being, even, more, than, 2, metres, tall, the, difference, in, height, between, these, upper, class, scythians, and, the, scythian, commoners, was, of, around, 10, to, 15, centimetres, with, the, height, difference, being, a, symbol, of, status, among, the, upper, class, men, analysis, of, skeletons, shows, that, scythians, had, longer, arm, and, leg, bones, and, stronger, bone, formation, than, present, day, people, living, in, their, former, territories, due, to, his, unfamiliarity, with, scythian, dress, pseudo, hippocrates, inaccurately, claimed, that, the, scythians, suffered, from, hypermobility, of, the, joints, in, histories, the, 5th, century, bc, greek, historian, herodotus, describes, the, budini, of, scythia, as, red, haired, and, grey, eyed, in, the, 5th, century, bc, greek, physician, hippocrates, argued, that, the, scythians, were, light, skinned, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, the, greek, poet, callimachus, described, the, arismapes, arimaspi, of, scythia, as, fair, haired, the, 2nd, century, bc, han, chinese, envoy, zhang, qian, described, the, sai, saka, an, eastern, people, closely, related, to, the, scythians, as, having, yellow, probably, meaning, hazel, or, green, and, blue, eyes, in, the, late, 2nd, century, ad, the, christian, theologian, clement, of, alexandria, says, that, the, scythians, and, the, celts, have, long, auburn, hair, the, 2nd, century, greek, philosopher, polemon, includes, the, scythians, among, the, northern, peoples, characterised, by, red, hair, and, blue, grey, eyes, in, the, late, 2nd, or, early, 3rd, century, ad, the, greek, physician, galen, writes, that, scythians, sarmatians, illyrians, germanic, peoples, and, other, northern, peoples, have, reddish, hair, the, fourth, century, bishop, gregory, of, nyssa, wrote, that, the, scythians, were, fair, skinned, and, blond, haired, the, 5th, century, physician, adamantius, who, often, followed, polemon, describes, the, scythians, as, fair, haired, the, scythians, specifically, western, or, pontic, scythians, as, in, differentiation, from, eastern, scythian, saka, primarily, emerged, from, the, bronze, and, iron, age, population, of, the, pontic, caspian, and, central, asian, steppe, western, steppe, herders, or, steppe, mlba, the, western, or, pontic, scythians, such, as, sarmatians, fall, in, or, close, to, the, european, related, cluster, while, eastern, scythians, such, as, the, pazyryk, culture, are, more, heterogeneous, both, genetically, and, culturally, western, scythian, groups, display, some, admixture, from, eastern, scythian, groups, which, is, in, part, associated, with, the, expansion, of, initial, scythian, material, culture, western, scythians, carried, diverse, west, eurasian, and, east, eurasian, maternal, lineages, initially, the, western, scythians, carried, only, west, eurasian, maternal, haplogroups, however, the, frequency, of, east, eurasian, haplogroups, rises, to, 26, in, samples, dated, from, the, 6th, 2nd, centuries, bce, among, the, western, scythians, discovered, at, rostov, on, don, in, european, russia, east, eurasian, maternal, haplogroups, make, up, 37, 5, of, the, total, these, results, suggest, that, there, was, increasing, marriages, to, women, of, east, eurasian, origin, among, the, western, scythians, the, east, eurasian, maternal, lineages, were, likely, brought, by, individuals, sharing, affinities, with, modern, day, nganasan, people, as, well, as, the, ancient, okunevo, culture, in, terms, of, paternal, haplogroups, almost, all, western, scythians, carried, west, eurasian, associated, haplogroups, western, scythian, remains, have, been, observed, to, carry, a, specific, clade, of, haplogroup, r1b, characteristic, of, the, northern, pontic, caspian, steppe, which, distinguishes, them, from, eastern, scythians, who, most, commonly, carried, haplogroup, haplogroup, r1a, one, scythian, from, the, samara, region, carried, r1a, z93, the, relationships, of, the, various, scythian, kings, with, each, other, are, not, known, for, certain, although, the, historian, and, anthropologist, anatoly, khazanov, suggests, that, the, scythians, had, been, ruled, by, the, same, dynasty, from, the, time, of, their, stay, in, west, asia, until, the, end, of, their, kingdom, in, the, pontic, steppe, and, that, madyes, and, the, later, scythian, kings, spargapeithes, and, ariapeithes, belonged, to, the, same, dynasty, and, ellis, minns, suggested, in, 1913, that, idanthyrsus, was, probably, the, father, of, ariapeithes, which, is, a, position, shared, by, the, scythologist, mikhail, bukharin, meanwhile, the, scholar, askold, ivantchik, instead, considers, madyes, spargapeithes, and, ariapeithes, to, have, each, belonged, to, a, different, dynasty
