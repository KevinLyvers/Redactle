1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945, asia, pacific, mediterranean, and, middle, east, other, campaigns, coups, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, the, longest, continuous, military, campaign, in, world, war, ii, ran, from, 1939, to, the, defeat, of, nazi, germany, in, 1945, covering, a, major, part, of, the, naval, history, of, world, war, ii, at, its, core, was, the, allied, naval, blockade, of, germany, announced, the, day, after, the, declaration, of, war, and, germany, s, subsequent, counter, blockade, the, campaign, peaked, from, mid, 1940, through, to, the, end, of, 1943, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, pitted, u, boats, and, other, warships, of, the, german, kriegsmarine, navy, and, aircraft, of, the, luftwaffe, air, force, against, the, royal, navy, royal, canadian, navy, united, states, navy, and, allied, merchant, shipping, convoys, coming, mainly, from, north, america, and, predominantly, going, to, the, united, kingdom, and, the, soviet, union, were, protected, for, the, most, part, by, the, british, and, canadian, navies, and, air, forces, these, forces, were, aided, by, ships, and, aircraft, of, the, united, states, beginning, september, 13, 1941, the, germans, were, joined, by, submarines, of, the, italian, regia, marina, royal, navy, after, germany, s, axis, ally, italy, entered, the, war, on, june, 10, 1940, as, an, island, country, the, united, kingdom, was, highly, dependent, on, imported, goods, britain, required, more, than, a, million, tons, of, imported, material, per, week, in, order, to, survive, and, fight, in, essence, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, involved, a, tonnage, war, the, allied, struggle, to, supply, britain, and, the, axis, attempt, to, stem, the, flow, of, merchant, shipping, that, enabled, britain, to, keep, fighting, rationing, in, the, united, kingdom, was, also, used, with, the, aim, of, reducing, demand, by, reducing, wastage, and, increasing, domestic, production, and, equality, of, distribution, from, 1942, onward, the, axis, also, sought, to, prevent, the, build, up, of, allied, supplies, and, equipment, in, the, uk, in, preparation, for, the, invasion, of, occupied, europe, the, defeat, of, the, u, boat, threat, was, a, prerequisite, for, pushing, back, the, axis, in, western, europe, the, outcome, of, the, battle, was, a, strategic, victory, for, the, allies, the, german, tonnage, war, failed, but, at, great, cost, 3, 500, merchant, ships, and, 175, warships, were, sunk, in, the, atlantic, for, the, loss, of, 783, u, boats, and, 47, german, surface, warships, including, 4, battleships, bismarck, scharnhorst, gneisenau, and, tirpitz, 9, cruisers, 7, raiders, and, 27, destroyers, this, front, ended, up, being, highly, significant, for, the, german, war, effort, germany, spent, more, money, on, producing, naval, vessels, than, it, did, every, type, of, ground, vehicle, combined, including, tanks, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, has, been, called, the, longest, largest, and, most, complex, naval, battle, in, history, the, campaign, started, immediately, after, the, european, war, began, during, the, so, called, phoney, war, and, lasted, more, than, five, years, until, the, german, surrender, in, may, 1945, it, involved, thousands, of, ships, in, a, theatre, covering, millions, of, square, miles, of, ocean, the, situation, changed, constantly, with, one, side, or, the, other, gaining, advantage, as, participating, countries, surrendered, joined, and, even, changed, sides, in, the, war, and, as, new, weapons, tactics, counter, measures, and, equipment, were, developed, by, both, sides, the, allies, gradually, gained, the, upper, hand, overcoming, german, surface, raiders, by, the, end, of, 1942, and, defeating, the, u, boats, by, mid, 1943, though, losses, due, to, u, boats, continued, until, the, war, s, end, british, prime, minister, winston, churchill, later, wrote, the, only, thing, that, really, frightened, me, during, the, war, was, the, u, boat, peril, i, was, even, more, anxious, about, this, battle, than, i, had, been, about, the, glorious, air, fight, called, the, battle, of, britain, on, 5, march, 1941, the, first, lord, of, the, admiralty, a, v, alexander, asked, parliament, for, many, more, ships, and, great, numbers, of, men, to, fight, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, which, he, compared, to, the, battle, of, france, fought, the, previous, summer, the, first, meeting, of, the, cabinet, s, battle, of, the, atlantic, committee, was, on, march, 19, churchill, claimed, to, have, coined, the, phrase, battle, of, the, atlantic, shortly, before, alexander, s, speech, but, there, are, several, examples, of, earlier, usage, following, the, use, of, unrestricted, submarine, warfare, by, germany, in, the, first, world, war, countries, tried, to, limit, or, abolish, submarines, the, effort, failed, instead, the, london, naval, treaty, required, submarines, to, abide, by, cruiser, rules, which, demanded, they, surface, search, and, place, ship, crews, in, a, place, of, safety, for, which, lifeboats, did, not, qualify, except, under, particular, circumstances, before, sinking, them, unless, the, ship, in, question, showed, persistent, refusal, to, stop, or, active, resistance, to, visit, or, search, these, regulations, did, not, prohibit, arming, merchantmen, but, doing, so, or, having, them, report, contact, with, submarines, or, raiders, made, them, de, facto, naval, auxiliaries, and, removed, the, protection, of, the, cruiser, rules, the, treaty, of, versailles, forbade, the, germans, to, operate, u, boats, and, reduced, the, german, surface, fleet, to, a, few, obsolete, ships, when, three, of, these, obsolete, ships, had, to, be, replaced, the, germans, opted, to, construct, the, deutschland, class, of, panzerschiffe, armoured, ships, or, pocket, battleships, as, they, were, nicknamed, by, foreign, navies, these, ships, were, designed, for, commerce, raiding, on, distant, seas, to, operate, as, a, raider, hunting, for, independently, sailing, ships, and, to, avoid, combat, with, superior, forces, the, anglo, german, naval, agreement, of, 1935, allowed, hitler, to, renounce, the, treaty, of, versailles, and, to, build, a, fleet, 35, the, size, of, britain, s, fleet, a, building, program, for, four, battleships, two, aircraft, carriers, five, heavy, cruisers, destroyers, and, u, boats, was, immediately, initiated, with, the, agreement, hitler, thought, that, conflict, with, the, uk, was, very, unlikely, and, hence, the, fleet, was, designed, for, commerce, raiding, against, the, french, rather, than, to, try, to, challenge, command, of, the, sea, the, commander, of, the, german, u, boats, karl, d, nitz, had, his, own, opinions, in, contrast, with, hitler, and, raeder, the, chief, of, the, german, navy, he, judged, that, war, with, the, uk, was, inevitable, and, that, not, a, large, surface, fleet, was, needed, but, that, u, boats, could, defeat, the, british, according, to, his, calculations, a, fleet, of, 300, medium, type, vii, u, boats, could, sink, a, million, tons, of, ships, a, month, and, within, a, year, sink, enough, of, the, about, 3, 000, british, merchant, ships, comprising, 17, 5, million, tons, to, strangle, the, british, economy, in, the, first, world, war, u, boats, had, been, defeated, mainly, by, the, convoy, system, but, d, nitz, thought, this, could, be, overcome, with, the, rudeltaktik, a, patrol, line, of, u, boats, searched, for, a, convoy, and, when, one, was, found, all, u, boats, converged, and, attacked, together, at, night, on, the, surface, aircraft, nor, asdic, were, considered, a, serious, threat, at, the, time, asdic, could, not, detect, a, surfaced, submarine, and, its, range, was, less, than, that, of, an, electric, torpedo, aircraft, could, not, operate, at, night, and, during, the, day, an, alert, u, boat, could, dive, before, the, aircraft, attacked, d, nitz, could, not, convince, raeder, of, his, ideas, so, each, time, the, u, boat, fleet, was, expanded, raeder, opted, to, build, a, mixture, of, coastal, medium, and, large, submarines, even, minelayers, and, u, cruisers, even, when, in, 1938, hitler, realised, he, would, sooner, or, later, have, to, oppose, the, uk, and, launched, his, plan, z, only, a, minority, of, the, planned, 239, u, boats, were, medium, u, boats, with, the, introduction, of, asdic, the, british, admiralty, believed, to, have, effectively, neutralized, the, submarine, threat, hence, the, number, of, destroyers, and, convoy, escorts, was, reduced, and, the, anti, submarine, branch, was, seen, as, third, rate, although, destroyers, were, also, equipped, with, asdic, it, was, expected, that, these, ships, would, be, used, in, fleet, actions, rather, than, anti, submarine, warfare, so, they, were, not, extensively, trained, in, their, use, trials, with, asdic, were, usually, conducted, in, ideal, conditions, and, the, british, admiralty, failed, to, appreciate, the, limitations, of, asdic, range, was, limited, asdic, worked, only, well, if, the, speed, of, the, operating, vessel, was, below, eight, knots, asdic, was, hampered, by, rough, weather, and, it, took, a, very, skilled, operator, to, distinguish, echoes, from, thermoclines, whales, shoals, of, fish, and, wrecks, also, early, versions, could, not, look, directly, down, so, contact, was, lost, during, the, final, stages, of, a, depth, charge, attack, the, basic, set, could, detect, range, and, bearing, but, target, depth, could, only, be, estimated, from, the, range, at, which, contact, was, lost, an, escort, swept, its, asdic, beam, in, an, arc, from, one, side, of, its, course, to, the, other, stopping, the, transducer, every, few, degrees, to, send, out, a, signal, on, detection, of, a, submarine, the, escort, would, close, in, at, moderate, speed, and, increase, its, speed, to, attack, the, intention, was, to, pass, over, the, submarine, rolling, depth, charges, from, chutes, at, the, stern, while, throwers, fired, further, charges, to, either, side, laying, a, pattern, of, depth, charges, to, effectively, disable, a, submarine, a, depth, charge, had, to, explode, within, about, 20, ft, 6, 1, m, since, early, asdic, equipment, was, poor, at, determining, depth, it, was, usual, to, vary, the, depth, settings, on, part, of, the, pattern, when, in, spring, 1939, the, threat, of, war, became, more, clear, it, was, realised, that, britain, could, not, rely, on, the, london, naval, treaty, that, outlawed, unrestricted, submarine, warfare, the, organisational, infrastructure, for, convoys, had, been, maintained, since, world, war, i, with, a, thorough, and, systematic, upgrade, in, the, second, half, of, the, 1930s, but, not, enough, escorts, were, available, for, convoy, escorting, and, a, crash, program, for, building, tree, class, trawlers, flower, class, corvettes, and, hunt, class, destroyers, was, initiated, merchant, ships, that, were, either, too, fast, or, too, slow, for, convoys, were, to, be, equipped, with, a, self, defence, gun, against, surfaced, submarine, attacks, thus, forcing, an, attacking, u, boat, to, spend, its, precious, torpedoes, this, however, removed, these, ships, from, the, protection, of, the, cruiser, rules, under, the, prize, law, nevertheless, despite, this, lack, of, readiness, in, 1939, the, royal, navy, probably, had, as, many, asdic, equipped, warships, in, service, as, all, the, other, navies, of, the, world, combined, similarly, the, role, of, aircraft, had, been, neglected, the, royal, air, force, had, organised, a, coastal, command, to, support, the, royal, navy, but, it, possessed, insufficient, aircraft, had, no, long, range, aircraft, nor, were, aircraft, crew, trained, in, anti, submarine, warfare, the, only, weapon, against, submarines, was, inadequate, bombs, finally, it, was, not, forgotten, that, in, world, war, i, mines, had, sunk, more, u, boats, than, any, other, weapon, plans, were, drafted, for, mine, fields, in, the, channel, and, along, the, east, coast, in, defence, of, shipping, lanes, and, also, offensive, mine, barrages, on, the, german, u, boat, lanes, toward, the, atlantic, ocean, in, 1939, the, kriegsmarine, lacked, the, strength, to, challenge, the, combined, british, royal, navy, and, french, navy, marine, nationale, for, command, of, the, sea, instead, german, naval, strategy, relied, on, commerce, raiding, using, capital, ships, armed, merchant, cruisers, submarines, and, aircraft, many, german, warships, were, already, at, sea, when, war, was, declared, in, september, 1939, including, most, of, the, available, u, boats, and, the, pocket, battleships, deutschland, and, admiral, graf, spee, which, had, sortied, into, the, atlantic, in, august, these, ships, immediately, attacked, british, and, french, shipping, u, 30, sank, the, ocean, liner, ss, athenia, within, hours, of, the, declaration, of, war, in, breach, of, her, orders, not, to, sink, passenger, ships, the, u, boat, fleet, which, was, to, dominate, so, much, of, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, was, small, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, many, of, the, 57, available, u, boats, were, the, small, and, short, range, type, iis, useful, primarily, for, minelaying, and, operations, in, british, coastal, waters, much, of, the, early, german, anti, shipping, activity, involved, minelaying, by, destroyers, aircraft, and, u, boats, off, british, ports, with, the, outbreak, of, war, the, british, and, french, immediately, began, a, blockade, of, germany, although, this, had, little, immediate, effect, on, german, industry, the, royal, navy, quickly, introduced, a, convoy, system, for, the, protection, of, trade, that, gradually, extended, out, from, the, british, isles, eventually, reaching, as, far, as, panama, bombay, and, singapore, convoys, allowed, the, royal, navy, to, concentrate, its, escorts, near, the, one, place, the, u, boats, were, guaranteed, to, be, found, the, convoys, each, convoy, consisted, of, between, 30, and, 70, mostly, unarmed, merchant, ships, some, british, naval, officials, particularly, the, first, lord, of, the, admiralty, winston, churchill, sought, a, more, offensive, strategy, the, royal, navy, formed, anti, submarine, hunting, groups, based, on, aircraft, carriers, to, patrol, the, shipping, lanes, in, the, western, approaches, and, hunt, for, german, u, boats, this, strategy, was, deeply, flawed, because, a, u, boat, with, its, tiny, silhouette, was, always, likely, to, spot, the, surface, warships, and, submerge, long, before, it, was, sighted, the, carrier, aircraft, were, little, help, although, they, could, spot, submarines, on, the, surface, at, this, stage, of, the, war, they, had, no, adequate, weapons, to, attack, them, and, any, submarine, found, by, an, aircraft, was, long, gone, by, the, time, surface, warships, arrived, the, hunting, group, strategy, proved, a, disaster, within, days, on, 14, september, 1939, britain, s, most, modern, carrier, hms, ark, royal, narrowly, avoided, being, sunk, when, three, torpedoes, from, u, 39, exploded, prematurely, u, 39, was, forced, to, surface, and, scuttle, by, the, escorting, destroyers, becoming, the, first, u, boat, loss, of, the, war, another, carrier, hms, courageous, was, sunk, three, days, later, by, u, 29, german, success, in, sinking, courageous, was, surpassed, a, month, later, when, g, nther, prien, in, u, 47, penetrated, the, british, base, at, scapa, flow, and, sank, the, old, battleship, hms, royal, oak, at, anchor, immediately, becoming, a, hero, in, germany, in, the, south, atlantic, british, forces, were, stretched, by, the, cruise, of, admiral, graf, spee, which, sank, nine, merchant, ships, of, 50, 000, gross, register, tons, grt, in, the, south, atlantic, and, indian, ocean, during, the, first, three, months, of, war, the, british, and, french, formed, a, series, of, hunting, groups, including, three, battlecruisers, three, aircraft, carriers, and, 15, cruisers, to, seek, the, raider, and, her, sister, deutschland, which, was, operating, in, the, north, atlantic, these, hunting, groups, had, no, success, until, admiral, graf, spee, was, caught, off, the, mouth, of, the, river, plate, between, argentina, and, uruguay, by, an, inferior, british, force, after, suffering, damage, in, the, subsequent, action, she, took, shelter, in, neutral, montevideo, harbour, and, was, scuttled, on, 17, december, 1939, after, this, initial, burst, of, activity, the, atlantic, campaign, quietened, down, admiral, karl, d, nitz, commander, of, the, u, boat, fleet, had, planned, a, maximum, submarine, effort, for, the, first, month, of, the, war, with, almost, all, the, available, u, boats, out, on, patrol, in, september, that, level, of, deployment, could, not, be, sustained, the, boats, needed, to, return, to, harbour, to, refuel, re, arm, re, stock, supplies, and, refit, the, harsh, winter, of, 1939, 40, which, froze, over, many, of, the, baltic, ports, seriously, hampered, the, german, offensive, by, trapping, several, new, u, boats, in, the, ice, hitler, s, plans, to, invade, norway, and, denmark, in, the, spring, of, 1940, led, to, the, withdrawal, of, the, fleet, s, surface, warships, and, most, of, the, ocean, going, u, boats, for, fleet, operations, in, operation, weser, bung, the, resulting, norwegian, campaign, revealed, serious, flaws, in, the, german, u, boat, torpedoes, both, the, impact, pistol, and, the, magnetic, influence, pistol, detonation, mechanism, were, defective, and, the, torpedoes, did, not, run, at, the, proper, depth, often, undershooting, targets, only, one, british, warship, was, sunk, by, u, boats, in, more, than, 38, attacks, as, the, news, spread, through, the, u, boat, fleet, it, began, to, undermine, morale, since, the, effectiviness, of, the, magnetic, pistol, was, already, reduced, by, the, degaussing, of, allied, ships, d, nitz, decided, to, use, new, contact, pistols, which, were, copied, from, british, torpedoes, found, in, the, captured, british, submarine, hms, seal, the, depth, setting, mechanism, was, improved, but, only, in, january, 1942, were, the, last, complications, with, that, mechanism, discovered, and, fixed, making, the, torpedo, a, more, reliable, weapon, the, german, occupation, of, norway, in, april, 1940, the, rapid, conquest, of, the, low, countries, and, france, in, may, and, june, and, the, italian, entry, into, the, war, on, the, axis, side, in, june, transformed, the, war, at, sea, in, general, and, the, atlantic, campaign, in, particular, in, three, main, ways, the, completion, of, hitler, s, campaign, in, western, europe, meant, u, boats, withdrawn, from, the, atlantic, for, the, norwegian, campaign, now, returned, to, the, war, on, trade, so, at, the, very, time, the, number, of, u, boats, on, patrol, in, the, atlantic, began, to, increase, the, number, of, escorts, available, for, the, convoys, was, greatly, reduced, the, only, consolation, for, the, british, was, that, the, large, merchant, fleets, of, occupied, countries, like, norway, and, the, netherlands, came, under, british, control, after, the, german, occupation, of, denmark, and, norway, britain, occupied, iceland, and, the, faroe, islands, establishing, bases, there, and, preventing, a, german, takeover, it, was, in, these, circumstances, that, winston, churchill, who, had, become, prime, minister, on, 10, may, 1940, first, wrote, to, president, franklin, roosevelt, to, request, the, loan, of, fifty, obsolescent, us, navy, destroyers, this, eventually, led, to, the, destroyers, for, bases, agreement, effectively, a, sale, but, portrayed, as, a, loan, for, political, reasons, which, operated, in, exchange, for, 99, year, leases, on, certain, british, bases, in, newfoundland, bermuda, and, the, west, indies, a, financially, advantageous, bargain, for, the, united, states, but, militarily, beneficial, for, britain, since, it, effectively, freed, up, british, military, assets, to, return, to, europe, a, significant, percentage, of, the, us, population, opposed, entering, the, war, and, some, american, politicians, including, the, us, ambassador, to, britain, joseph, p, kennedy, believed, that, britain, and, its, allies, might, actually, lose, the, first, of, these, destroyers, were, only, taken, over, by, their, british, and, canadian, crews, in, september, and, all, needed, to, be, rearmed, and, fitted, with, asdic, it, was, to, be, many, months, before, these, ships, contributed, to, the, campaign, the, early, u, boat, operations, from, the, french, bases, were, spectacularly, successful, this, was, the, heyday, of, the, great, u, boat, aces, like, g, nther, prien, of, u, 47, otto, kretschmer, u, 99, joachim, schepke, u, 100, engelbert, endrass, u, 46, victor, oehrn, u, 37, and, heinrich, bleichrodt, u, 48, u, boat, crews, became, heroes, in, germany, from, june, until, october, 1940, over, 270, allied, ships, were, sunk, this, period, was, referred, to, by, u, boat, crews, as, the, happy, time, die, gl, ckliche, zeit, churchill, would, later, write, the, only, thing, that, ever, frightened, me, during, the, war, was, the, u, boat, peril, the, biggest, challenge, for, the, u, boats, was, to, find, the, convoys, in, the, vastness, of, the, ocean, the, germans, had, a, handful, of, very, long, range, focke, wulf, fw, 200, condor, aircraft, based, at, bordeaux, and, stavanger, which, were, used, for, reconnaissance, the, condor, was, a, converted, civilian, airliner, a, stop, gap, solution, for, fliegerf, hrer, atlantik, due, to, ongoing, friction, between, the, luftwaffe, and, kriegsmarine, the, primary, source, of, convoy, sightings, was, the, u, boats, themselves, since, a, submarine, s, bridge, was, very, close, to, the, water, their, range, of, visual, detection, was, quite, limited, the, best, source, proved, to, be, the, codebreakers, of, b, dienst, who, had, succeeded, in, deciphering, the, british, naval, cypher, no, 3, allowing, the, germans, to, estimate, where, and, when, convoys, could, be, expected, in, response, the, british, applied, the, techniques, of, operations, research, to, the, problem, and, came, up, with, some, counter, intuitive, solutions, for, protecting, convoys, they, realised, that, the, area, of, a, convoy, increased, by, the, square, of, its, perimeter, meaning, the, same, number, of, ships, using, the, same, number, of, escorts, was, better, protected, in, one, convoy, than, in, two, a, large, convoy, was, as, difficult, to, locate, as, a, small, one, moreover, reduced, frequency, also, reduced, the, chances, of, detection, as, fewer, large, convoys, could, carry, the, same, amount, of, cargo, while, large, convoys, take, longer, to, assemble, therefore, a, few, large, convoys, with, apparently, few, escorts, were, safer, than, many, small, convoys, with, a, higher, ratio, of, escorts, to, merchantmen, instead, of, attacking, the, allied, convoys, singly, u, boats, were, directed, to, work, in, wolf, packs, rudel, coordinated, by, radio, the, boats, spread, out, into, a, long, patrol, line, that, bisected, the, path, of, the, allied, convoy, routes, once, in, position, the, crew, studied, the, horizon, through, binoculars, looking, for, masts, or, smoke, or, used, hydrophones, to, pick, up, propeller, noises, when, one, boat, sighted, a, convoy, it, would, report, the, sighting, to, u, boat, headquarters, shadowing, and, continuing, to, report, as, needed, until, other, boats, arrived, typically, at, night, instead, of, being, faced, by, single, submarines, the, convoy, escorts, then, had, to, cope, with, groups, of, up, to, half, a, dozen, u, boats, attacking, simultaneously, the, most, daring, commanders, such, as, kretschmer, penetrated, the, escort, screen, and, attacked, from, within, the, columns, of, merchantmen, the, escort, vessels, which, were, too, few, in, number, and, often, lacking, in, endurance, had, no, answer, to, multiple, submarines, attacking, on, the, surface, at, night, as, their, asdic, worked, well, only, against, underwater, targets, early, british, marine, radar, working, in, the, metric, bands, lacked, target, discrimination, and, range, moreover, corvettes, were, too, slow, to, catch, a, surfaced, u, boat, pack, tactics, were, first, used, successfully, in, september, and, october, 1940, to, devastating, effect, in, a, series, of, convoy, battles, on, september, 21, convoy, hx, 72, of, 42, merchantmen, was, attacked, by, a, pack, of, four, u, boats, which, sank, eleven, ships, and, damaged, two, over, the, course, of, two, nights, in, october, the, slow, convoy, sc, 7, with, an, escort, of, two, sloops, and, two, corvettes, was, overwhelmed, losing, 59, of, its, ships, the, battle, for, hx, 79, in, the, following, days, was, in, many, ways, worse, for, the, escorts, than, for, sc, 7, the, loss, of, a, quarter, of, the, convoy, without, any, loss, to, the, u, boats, despite, a, very, strong, escort, two, destroyers, four, corvettes, three, trawlers, and, a, minesweeper, demonstrated, the, effectiveness, of, the, german, tactics, against, the, inadequate, british, anti, submarine, methods, on, 1, december, seven, german, and, three, italian, submarines, caught, hx, 90, sinking, 10, ships, and, damaging, three, others, at, the, end, of, the, year, 1940, the, admiralty, viewed, the, number, of, ships, sunk, with, growing, alarm, damaged, ships, might, survive, but, could, be, out, of, commission, for, long, periods, two, million, gross, tons, of, merchant, shipping, 13, of, the, fleet, available, to, the, british, were, under, repair, and, unavailable, which, had, the, same, effect, in, slowing, down, cross, atlantic, supplies, nor, were, the, u, boats, the, only, threat, following, some, early, experience, in, support, of, the, war, at, sea, during, operation, weser, bung, the, luftwaffe, began, to, take, a, toll, of, merchant, ships, martin, harlinghausen, and, his, recently, established, command, fliegerf, hrer, atlantik, contributed, small, numbers, of, aircraft, to, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, from, 1941, onwards, these, were, primarily, fw, 200, condors, the, condors, also, bombed, convoys, that, were, beyond, land, based, fighter, cover, and, thus, defenceless, initially, the, condors, were, very, successful, claiming, 365, 000, tons, of, shipping, in, early, 1941, these, aircraft, were, few, in, number, however, and, directly, under, luftwaffe, control, in, addition, the, pilots, had, little, specialised, training, for, anti, shipping, warfare, limiting, their, effectiveness, the, germans, received, help, from, their, allies, from, august, 1940, a, flotilla, of, 27, italian, submarines, operated, from, the, betasom, base, in, bordeaux, to, attack, allied, shipping, in, the, atlantic, initially, under, the, command, of, rear, admiral, angelo, parona, then, of, rear, admiral, romolo, polacchini, and, finally, of, ship, of, the, line, captain, enzo, grossi, the, italian, submarines, had, been, designed, to, operate, in, a, different, way, than, u, boats, and, they, had, a, number, of, flaws, that, needed, to, be, corrected, for, example, huge, conning, towers, slow, speed, when, surfaced, lack, of, modern, torpedo, fire, control, which, meant, that, they, were, ill, suited, for, convoy, attacks, and, performed, better, when, hunting, down, isolated, merchantmen, on, distant, seas, taking, advantage, of, their, superior, range, and, living, standards, while, initial, operation, met, with, little, success, only, 65343, grt, sunk, between, august, and, december, 1940, the, situation, improved, gradually, over, time, and, up, to, august, 1943, the, 32, italian, submarines, that, operated, there, sank, 109, ships, of, 593, 864, tons, for, 17, subs, lost, in, return, giving, them, a, subs, lost, to, tonnage, sunk, ratio, similar, to, germany, s, in, the, same, period, and, higher, overall, the, italians, were, also, successful, with, their, use, of, human, torpedo, chariots, disabling, several, british, ships, in, gibraltar, despite, these, successes, the, italian, intervention, was, not, favourably, regarded, by, d, nitz, who, characterised, italians, as, inadequately, disciplined, and, unable, to, remain, calm, in, the, face, of, the, enemy, they, were, unable, to, co, operate, in, wolf, pack, tactics, or, even, reliably, report, contacts, or, weather, conditions, and, their, area, of, operation, was, moved, away, from, those, of, the, germans, amongst, the, more, successful, italian, submarine, commanders, who, operated, in, the, atlantic, were, carlo, fecia, di, cossato, commander, of, the, submarine, enrico, tazzoli, and, gianfranco, gazzana, priaroggia, commander, of, archimede, and, then, of, leonardo, da, vinci, despite, their, success, u, boats, were, still, not, recognised, as, the, foremost, threat, to, the, north, atlantic, convoys, with, the, exception, of, men, like, d, nitz, most, naval, officers, on, both, sides, regarded, surface, warships, as, the, ultimate, commerce, destroyers, for, the, first, half, of, 1940, there, were, no, german, surface, raiders, in, the, atlantic, because, the, german, fleet, had, been, concentrated, for, the, invasion, of, norway, the, sole, pocket, battleship, raider, admiral, graf, spee, had, been, stopped, at, the, battle, of, the, river, plate, by, an, inferior, and, outgunned, british, squadron, from, the, summer, of, 1940, a, small, but, steady, stream, of, warships, and, armed, merchant, raiders, set, sail, from, germany, for, the, atlantic, the, power, of, a, raider, against, a, convoy, was, demonstrated, by, the, fate, of, convoy, hx, 84, attacked, by, the, pocket, battleship, admiral, scheer, on, 5, november, 1940, admiral, scheer, quickly, sank, five, ships, and, damaged, several, others, as, the, convoy, scattered, only, the, sacrifice, of, the, escorting, armed, merchant, cruiser, hms, jervis, bay, whose, commander, edward, fegen, was, awarded, a, posthumous, victoria, cross, and, failing, light, allowed, the, other, merchantmen, to, escape, the, british, now, suspended, north, atlantic, convoys, and, the, home, fleet, put, to, sea, to, try, to, intercept, admiral, scheer, the, search, failed, and, admiral, scheer, disappeared, into, the, south, atlantic, she, reappeared, in, the, indian, ocean, the, following, month, other, german, surface, raiders, now, began, to, make, their, presence, felt, on, christmas, day, 1940, the, cruiser, admiral, hipper, attacked, the, troop, convoy, ws, 5a, but, was, driven, off, by, the, escorting, cruisers, admiral, hipper, had, more, success, two, months, later, on, 12, february, 1941, when, she, found, the, unescorted, convoy, sls, 64, of, 19, ships, and, sank, seven, of, them, in, january, 1941, the, battleships, scharnhorst, and, gneisenau, put, to, sea, from, germany, to, raid, the, shipping, lanes, in, operation, berlin, with, so, many, german, raiders, at, large, in, the, atlantic, the, british, were, forced, to, provide, battleship, escorts, to, as, many, convoys, as, possible, this, twice, saved, convoys, from, slaughter, by, the, german, battleships, in, february, the, old, battleship, hms, ramillies, deterred, an, attack, on, hx, 106, a, month, later, sl, 67, was, saved, by, the, presence, of, hms, malaya, in, may, the, germans, mounted, the, most, ambitious, raid, of, all, operation, rhein, bung, the, new, battleship, bismarck, and, the, cruiser, prinz, eugen, put, to, sea, to, attack, convoys, a, british, fleet, intercepted, the, raiders, off, iceland, in, the, battle, of, the, denmark, strait, the, battlecruiser, hms, hood, was, blown, up, and, sunk, but, bismarck, was, damaged, and, had, to, run, to, france, bismarck, nearly, reached, her, destination, but, was, disabled, by, an, airstrike, from, the, carrier, ark, royal, and, then, sunk, by, the, home, fleet, the, next, day, her, sinking, marked, the, end, of, the, warship, raids, the, advent, of, long, range, search, aircraft, notably, the, unglamorous, but, versatile, pby, catalina, largely, neutralised, surface, raiders, in, february, 1942, scharnhorst, gneisenau, and, prinz, eugen, moved, from, brest, back, to, germany, in, the, channel, dash, while, this, was, an, embarrassment, for, the, british, it, was, the, end, of, the, german, surface, threat, in, the, atlantic, the, loss, of, bismarck, the, destruction, of, the, network, of, supply, ships, that, supported, surface, raiders, the, repeated, damage, to, the, three, ships, by, air, raids, the, entry, of, the, united, states, into, the, war, arctic, convoys, and, the, perceived, invasion, threat, to, norway, had, persuaded, hitler, and, the, naval, staff, to, withdraw, the, disastrous, convoy, battles, of, october, 1940, forced, a, change, in, british, tactics, the, most, important, of, these, was, the, introduction, of, permanent, escort, groups, to, improve, the, coordination, and, effectiveness, of, ships, and, men, in, battle, british, efforts, were, helped, by, a, gradual, increase, in, the, number, of, escort, vessels, available, as, the, old, ex, american, destroyers, and, the, new, british, and, canadian, built, flower, class, corvettes, were, now, coming, into, service, in, numbers, many, of, these, ships, became, part, of, the, huge, expansion, of, the, royal, canadian, navy, which, grew, from, a, handful, of, destroyers, at, the, outbreak, of, war, to, take, an, increasing, share, of, convoy, escort, duty, others, of, the, new, ships, were, crewed, by, free, french, norwegian, and, dutch, but, these, were, a, tiny, minority, of, the, total, number, and, directly, under, british, command, by, 1941, american, public, opinion, had, begun, to, swing, against, germany, but, the, war, was, still, essentially, great, britain, and, the, empire, against, germany, initially, the, new, escort, groups, consisted, of, two, or, three, destroyers, and, half, a, dozen, corvettes, since, two, or, three, of, the, group, would, usually, be, in, dock, repairing, weather, or, battle, damage, the, groups, typically, sailed, with, about, six, ships, the, training, of, the, escorts, also, improved, as, the, realities, of, the, battle, became, obvious, a, new, base, was, set, up, at, tobermory, in, the, hebrides, to, prepare, the, new, escort, ships, and, their, crews, for, the, demands, of, battle, under, the, strict, regime, of, vice, admiral, gilbert, o, stephenson, in, february, 1941, the, admiralty, moved, the, headquarters, of, western, approaches, command, from, plymouth, to, liverpool, where, much, closer, contact, with, and, control, of, the, atlantic, convoys, was, possible, greater, cooperation, with, supporting, aircraft, was, also, achieved, in, april, the, admiralty, took, over, operational, control, of, coastal, command, aircraft, tactically, new, short, wave, radar, sets, that, could, detect, surfaced, u, boats, and, were, suitable, for, both, small, ships, and, aircraft, began, to, arrive, during, 1941, the, impact, of, these, changes, first, began, to, be, felt, in, the, battles, during, the, spring, of, 1941, in, early, march, prien, in, u, 47, failed, to, return, from, patrol, two, weeks, later, in, the, battle, of, convoy, hx, 112, the, newly, formed, 3rd, escort, group, of, four, destroyers, and, two, corvettes, held, off, the, u, boat, pack, u, 100, was, detected, by, the, primitive, radar, on, the, destroyer, hms, vanoc, rammed, and, sunk, shortly, afterwards, u, 99, was, also, caught, and, sunk, its, crew, captured, d, nitz, had, lost, his, three, leading, aces, kretschmer, prien, and, schepke, d, nitz, now, moved, his, wolf, packs, further, west, in, order, to, catch, the, convoys, before, the, anti, submarine, escort, joined, this, new, strategy, was, rewarded, at, the, beginning, of, april, when, the, pack, found, convoy, sc, 26, before, its, anti, submarine, escort, had, joined, ten, ships, were, sunk, but, another, u, boat, was, lost, in, june, 1941, the, british, decided, to, provide, convoy, escort, for, the, full, length, of, the, north, atlantic, crossing, to, this, end, the, admiralty, asked, the, royal, canadian, navy, on, may, 23, to, assume, the, responsibility, for, protecting, convoys, in, the, western, zone, and, to, establish, the, base, for, its, escort, force, at, st, john, s, newfoundland, on, june, 13, 1941, commodore, leonard, murray, royal, canadian, navy, assumed, his, post, as, commodore, commanding, newfoundland, escort, force, under, the, overall, authority, of, the, commander, in, chief, western, approaches, at, liverpool, six, canadian, destroyers, and, 17, corvettes, reinforced, by, seven, destroyers, three, sloops, and, five, corvettes, of, the, royal, navy, were, assembled, for, duty, in, the, force, which, escorted, the, convoys, from, canadian, ports, to, newfoundland, and, then, on, to, a, meeting, point, south, of, iceland, where, the, british, escort, groups, took, over, by, 1941, the, united, states, was, taking, an, increasing, part, in, the, war, despite, its, nominal, neutrality, in, april, 1941, president, roosevelt, extended, the, pan, american, security, zone, east, almost, as, far, as, iceland, british, forces, occupied, iceland, when, denmark, fell, to, the, germans, in, 1940, the, us, was, persuaded, to, provide, forces, to, relieve, british, troops, on, the, island, american, warships, began, escorting, allied, convoys, in, the, western, atlantic, as, far, as, iceland, and, had, several, hostile, encounters, with, u, boats, in, june, 1941, the, us, realised, the, tropical, atlantic, had, become, dangerous, for, unescorted, american, as, well, as, british, ships, on, may, 21, ss, robin, moor, an, american, vessel, carrying, no, military, supplies, was, sunk, by, u, 69, 750, nautical, miles, 1, 390, km, west, of, freetown, sierra, leone, when, news, of, the, sinking, reached, the, us, few, shipping, companies, felt, truly, safe, anywhere, as, time, magazine, noted, in, june, 1941, if, such, sinkings, continue, u, s, ships, bound, for, other, places, remote, from, fighting, fronts, will, be, in, danger, henceforth, the, u, s, would, either, have, to, recall, its, ships, from, the, ocean, or, enforce, its, right, to, the, free, use, of, the, seas, a, mid, ocean, escort, force, of, british, canadian, and, american, destroyers, and, corvettes, was, organised, following, the, declaration, of, war, by, the, united, states, in, december, 1941, at, the, same, time, the, british, were, working, on, a, number, of, technical, developments, which, would, address, the, german, submarine, superiority, though, these, were, british, inventions, the, critical, technologies, were, provided, freely, to, the, us, which, then, renamed, and, manufactured, them, likewise, the, us, provided, the, british, with, catalina, flying, boats, and, liberator, bombers, that, were, important, contributions, to, the, war, effort, aircraft, ranges, were, constantly, improving, but, the, atlantic, was, far, too, large, to, be, covered, completely, by, land, based, types, a, stop, gap, measure, was, instituted, by, fitting, ramps, to, the, front, of, some, of, the, cargo, ships, known, as, catapult, aircraft, merchantmen, cam, ships, equipped, with, a, lone, expendable, hurricane, fighter, aircraft, when, a, german, bomber, approached, the, fighter, was, launched, off, the, end, of, the, ramp, with, a, large, rocket, to, shoot, down, or, drive, off, the, german, aircraft, the, pilot, then, ditching, in, the, water, and, in, the, best, case, recovered, by, ship, nine, combat, launches, were, made, resulting, in, the, destruction, of, eight, axis, aircraft, for, the, loss, of, one, allied, pilot, although, cam, ships, and, their, hurricanes, did, not, down, a, great, number, of, enemy, aircraft, such, aircraft, were, mostly, fw, 200, condors, that, would, often, shadow, the, convoy, out, of, range, of, the, convoy, s, guns, reporting, back, the, convoy, s, course, and, position, so, that, u, boats, could, then, be, directed, on, to, the, convoy, the, cam, ships, and, their, hurricanes, thus, justified, the, cost, in, fewer, ship, losses, overall, one, of, the, more, important, developments, was, ship, borne, direction, finding, radio, equipment, known, as, hf, df, high, frequency, direction, finding, or, huff, duff, which, started, to, be, fitted, to, escorts, from, february, 1942, these, sets, were, common, items, of, equipment, by, the, spring, of, 1943, hf, df, let, an, operator, determine, the, direction, of, a, radio, signal, regardless, of, whether, the, content, could, be, read, since, the, wolf, pack, relied, on, u, boats, reporting, convoy, positions, by, radio, there, was, a, steady, stream, of, messages, to, intercept, an, escort, could, then, run, in, the, direction, of, the, signal, and, attack, the, u, boat, or, at, least, force, it, to, submerge, causing, it, to, lose, contact, which, might, prevent, an, attack, on, the, convoy, when, two, ships, fitted, with, hf, df, accompanied, a, convoy, a, fix, on, the, transmitter, s, position, not, just, direction, could, be, determined, however, the, standard, approach, of, anti, submarine, warships, was, immediately, to, run, down, the, bearing, of, a, detected, signal, hoping, to, spot, the, u, boat, on, the, surface, and, make, an, immediate, attack, range, could, be, estimated, by, an, experienced, operator, from, the, signal, strength, usually, the, target, was, found, visually, if, the, submarine, was, slow, to, dive, the, guns, were, used, otherwise, an, asdic, sonar, search, was, started, where, the, swirl, of, water, of, a, crash, diving, submarine, was, observed, in, good, visibility, a, u, boat, might, try, and, outrun, an, escort, on, the, surface, whilst, out, of, gun, range, the, british, also, made, extensive, use, of, shore, hf, df, stations, to, keep, convoys, updated, with, positions, of, u, boats, hf, df, was, also, installed, on, american, ships, the, radio, technology, behind, direction, finding, was, simple, and, well, understood, by, both, sides, but, the, technology, commonly, used, before, the, war, used, a, manually, rotated, aerial, to, fix, the, direction, of, the, transmitter, this, was, delicate, work, took, quite, a, time, to, accomplish, to, any, degree, of, accuracy, and, since, it, only, revealed, the, line, along, which, the, transmission, originated, a, single, set, could, not, determine, if, the, transmission, was, from, the, true, direction, or, its, reciprocal, 180, degrees, in, the, opposite, direction, two, sets, were, required, to, fix, the, position, believing, this, to, still, be, the, case, german, u, boat, radio, operators, considered, themselves, fairly, safe, if, they, kept, messages, short, the, british, however, developed, an, oscilloscope, based, indicator, which, instantly, fixed, the, direction, and, its, reciprocal, the, moment, a, radio, operator, touched, his, morse, key, it, worked, simply, with, a, crossed, pair, of, conventional, and, fixed, directional, aerials, the, oscilloscope, display, showing, the, relative, received, strength, from, each, aerial, as, an, elongated, ellipse, showing, the, line, relative, to, the, ship, the, innovation, was, a, sense, aerial, which, when, switched, in, suppressed, the, ellipse, in, the, wrong, direction, leaving, only, the, correct, bearing, with, this, there, was, hardly, any, need, to, triangulate, the, escort, could, just, run, down, the, precise, bearing, provided, estimating, range, from, the, signal, strength, and, use, either, efficient, look, outs, or, radar, for, final, positioning, many, u, boat, attacks, were, suppressed, and, submarines, sunk, in, this, way, a, good, example, of, the, great, difference, apparently, minor, aspects, of, technology, could, make, to, the, battle, the, way, d, nitz, conducted, the, u, boat, campaign, required, relatively, large, volumes, of, radio, traffic, between, u, boats, and, headquarters, this, was, thought, to, be, safe, as, the, radio, messages, were, encrypted, using, the, enigma, cipher, machine, which, the, germans, considered, unbreakable, in, addition, the, kriegsmarine, used, much, more, secure, operating, procedures, than, the, heer, army, or, luftwaffe, air, force, the, machine, s, three, rotors, were, chosen, from, a, set, of, eight, rather, than, the, other, services, five, the, rotors, were, changed, every, other, day, using, a, system, of, key, sheets, and, the, message, settings, were, different, for, every, message, and, determined, from, bigram, tables, that, were, issued, to, operators, in, 1939, it, was, generally, believed, at, the, british, government, code, and, cypher, school, gc, cs, at, bletchley, park, that, naval, enigma, could, not, be, broken, only, the, head, of, the, german, naval, section, frank, birch, and, the, mathematician, alan, turing, believed, otherwise, the, british, codebreakers, needed, to, know, the, wiring, of, the, special, naval, enigma, rotors, the, capture, of, several, enigma, rotors, during, the, sinking, of, u, 33, by, hms, gleaner, j83, in, february, 1940, provided, this, information, in, early, 1941, the, royal, navy, made, a, concerted, effort, to, assist, the, codebreakers, and, on, may, 9, crew, members, of, the, destroyer, bulldog, boarded, u, 110, and, recovered, her, cryptologic, material, including, bigram, tables, and, current, enigma, keys, the, captured, material, allowed, all, u, boat, traffic, to, be, read, for, several, weeks, until, the, keys, ran, out, the, familiarity, codebreakers, gained, with, the, usual, content, of, messages, helped, in, breaking, new, keys, in, august, 1940, the, british, began, use, of, their, bombe, computer, which, when, presented, with, an, intercepted, german, enigma, message, suggested, possible, settings, with, which, the, enigma, cipher, machine, had, been, programmed, a, reverse, engineered, enigma, machine, in, british, hands, could, then, be, programmed, with, each, set, of, suggested, settings, in, turn, until, the, message, was, successfully, deciphered, throughout, the, summer, and, autumn, of, 1941, enigma, intercepts, combined, with, hf, df, enabled, the, british, to, plot, the, positions, of, u, boat, patrol, lines, and, route, convoys, around, them, merchant, ship, losses, dropped, by, over, two, thirds, in, july, 1941, and, the, losses, remained, low, until, november, this, allied, advantage, was, offset, by, the, growing, numbers, of, u, boats, coming, into, service, the, type, viic, began, reaching, the, atlantic, in, large, numbers, in, 1941, by, the, end, of, 1945, 568, had, been, commissioned, although, the, allies, could, protect, their, convoys, in, late, 1941, they, were, not, sinking, many, u, boats, the, flower, class, corvette, escorts, could, detect, and, defend, but, they, were, not, fast, enough, to, attack, effectively, an, extraordinary, incident, occurred, when, a, coastal, command, hudson, of, no, 209, squadron, raf, captured, u, 570, on, 27, august, 1941, about, 80, miles, 130, km, south, of, iceland, squadron, leader, j, thompson, sighted, the, u, boat, on, the, surface, immediately, dived, at, his, target, and, released, four, depth, charges, as, the, submarine, crash, dived, the, u, boat, surfaced, again, a, number, of, crewmen, appeared, on, deck, and, thompson, engaged, them, with, his, aircraft, s, guns, the, crewmen, returned, to, the, conning, tower, while, under, fire, a, few, moments, later, a, white, flag, and, a, similarly, coloured, board, were, displayed, thompson, called, for, assistance, and, circled, the, german, vessel, a, catalina, from, 209, squadron, took, over, watching, the, damaged, u, boat, until, the, arrival, of, the, armed, trawler, kingston, agate, under, lt, henry, owen, l, estrange, the, following, day, the, u, boat, was, beached, in, an, icelandic, cove, although, no, codes, or, secret, papers, were, recovered, the, british, now, possessed, a, complete, u, boat, after, a, refit, u, 570, was, commissioned, into, the, royal, navy, as, hms, graph, in, october, 1941, hitler, ordered, d, nitz, to, move, u, boats, into, the, mediterranean, sea, to, support, german, operations, in, that, theatre, the, resulting, concentration, near, gibraltar, produced, a, series, of, battles, around, the, gibraltar, and, sierra, leone, convoys, in, december, 1941, convoy, hg, 76, sailed, escorted, by, the, 36th, escort, group, of, two, sloops, and, six, corvettes, under, captain, frederic, john, walker, reinforced, by, the, first, of, the, new, escort, carriers, hms, audacity, and, three, destroyers, from, gibraltar, the, convoy, was, immediately, intercepted, by, the, waiting, u, boat, pack, resulting, in, a, brutal, five, day, battle, walker, was, a, tactical, innovator, and, his, ships, crews, were, highly, trained, the, presence, of, an, escort, carrier, meant, u, boats, were, frequently, sighted, and, forced, to, dive, before, they, could, get, close, to, the, convoy, at, least, until, audacity, was, sunk, after, two, days, the, five, day, battle, cost, the, germans, five, u, boats, four, sunk, by, walker, s, group, while, the, british, lost, audacity, a, destroyer, and, only, two, merchant, ships, the, battle, was, the, first, clear, allied, convoy, victory, through, dogged, effort, the, allies, slowly, gained, the, upper, hand, until, the, end, of, 1941, although, allied, warships, failed, to, sink, u, boats, in, large, numbers, most, convoys, evaded, attack, completely, shipping, losses, were, high, but, manageable, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, and, the, subsequent, german, declaration, of, war, on, the, united, states, had, an, immediate, effect, on, the, campaign, d, nitz, promptly, planned, to, attack, shipping, off, the, american, east, coast, he, had, only, five, type, ix, boats, able, to, reach, us, waters, for, operation, drumbeat, paukenschlag, sometimes, called, by, the, germans, the, second, happy, time, the, us, having, no, direct, experience, of, modern, naval, war, on, its, own, shores, did, not, employ, a, black, out, u, boats, simply, stood, off, shore, at, night, and, picked, out, ships, silhouetted, against, city, lights, admiral, ernest, king, commander, in, chief, united, states, fleet, cominch, who, disliked, the, british, initially, rejected, royal, navy, calls, for, a, coastal, black, out, or, convoy, system, king, has, been, criticised, for, this, decision, but, his, defenders, argue, the, united, states, destroyer, fleet, was, limited, partly, because, of, the, sale, of, 50, old, destroyers, to, britain, earlier, in, the, war, and, king, claimed, it, was, far, more, important, that, destroyers, protect, allied, troop, transports, than, merchant, shipping, his, ships, were, also, busy, convoying, lend, lease, material, to, the, soviet, union, as, well, as, fighting, the, japanese, in, the, pacific, king, could, not, require, coastal, black, outs, the, army, had, legal, authority, over, all, civil, defence, and, did, not, follow, advice, the, royal, navy, or, royal, canadian, navy, provided, that, even, unescorted, convoys, would, be, safer, than, merchants, sailing, individually, no, troop, transports, were, lost, but, merchant, ships, sailing, in, us, waters, were, left, exposed, and, suffered, accordingly, britain, eventually, had, to, build, coastal, escorts, and, provide, them, to, the, us, in, a, reverse, lend, lease, since, king, was, unable, or, unwilling, to, make, any, provision, himself, the, first, u, boats, reached, us, waters, on, january, 13, 1942, by, the, time, they, withdrew, on, february, 6, they, had, sunk, 156, 939, tonnes, of, shipping, without, loss, the, first, batch, of, type, ixs, was, followed, by, more, type, ixs, and, type, viis, supported, by, type, xiv, milk, cow, tankers, which, provided, refuelling, at, sea, they, sank, 397, ships, totalling, over, 2, million, tons, as, mentioned, previously, not, a, single, troop, transport, was, lost, in, 1943, the, united, states, launched, over, 11, million, tons, of, merchant, shipping, that, number, declined, in, the, later, war, years, as, priorities, moved, elsewhere, in, may, king, by, this, time, both, cominch, and, cno, finally, scraped, together, enough, ships, to, institute, a, convoy, system, this, quickly, led, to, the, loss, of, seven, u, boats, the, us, did, not, have, enough, ships, to, cover, all, the, gaps, the, u, boats, continued, to, operate, freely, during, the, battle, of, the, caribbean, and, throughout, the, gulf, of, mexico, where, they, effectively, closed, several, us, ports, until, july, when, the, british, loaned, escorts, began, arriving, these, included, 24, anti, submarine, armed, trawlers, the, institution, of, an, interlocking, convoy, system, on, the, american, coast, and, in, the, caribbean, sea, in, mid, 1942, resulted, in, an, immediate, drop, in, attacks, in, those, areas, as, a, result, of, the, increased, coastal, convoy, escort, system, the, u, boats, attention, was, shifted, back, to, the, atlantic, convoys, for, the, allies, the, situation, was, serious, but, not, critical, throughout, much, of, 1942, with, the, us, finally, arranging, convoys, in, their, sector, of, the, atlantic, ship, losses, to, the, u, boats, quickly, dropped, and, d, nitz, realised, his, u, boats, were, better, used, elsewhere, on, july, 19, 1942, he, ordered, the, last, boats, to, withdraw, from, the, united, states, atlantic, coast, by, the, end, of, july, 1942, he, had, shifted, his, attention, back, to, the, north, atlantic, where, allied, aircraft, could, not, provide, cover, i, e, the, black, pit, convoy, sc, 94, marked, the, return, of, the, u, boats, to, the, convoys, from, canada, to, britain, the, command, centre, for, the, submarines, operating, in, the, west, including, the, atlantic, also, changed, moving, to, a, newly, constructed, command, bunker, at, the, ch, teau, de, pignerolle, just, east, of, angers, on, the, loire, river, the, headquarters, was, commanded, by, hans, rudolf, r, sing, there, were, enough, u, boats, spread, across, the, atlantic, to, allow, several, wolf, packs, to, attack, many, different, convoy, routes, often, as, many, as, 10, to, 15, boats, would, attack, in, one, or, two, waves, following, convoys, like, sc, 104, and, sc, 107, by, day, and, attacking, at, night, convoy, losses, quickly, increased, and, in, october, 1942, 56, ships, of, over, 258, 000, tonnes, were, sunk, in, the, air, gap, between, greenland, and, iceland, u, boat, losses, also, climbed, in, the, first, six, months, of, 1942, 21, were, lost, less, than, one, for, every, 40, merchant, ships, sunk, in, the, last, six, months, of, 1942, 66, were, sunk, one, for, every, 10, merchant, ships, almost, as, many, as, in, the, previous, two, years, together, on, november, 19, 1942, admiral, noble, was, replaced, as, commander, in, chief, of, western, approaches, command, by, admiral, sir, max, horton, horton, used, the, growing, number, of, escorts, becoming, available, to, organise, support, groups, to, reinforce, convoys, that, came, under, attack, unlike, the, regular, escort, groups, support, groups, were, not, directly, responsible, for, the, safety, of, any, particular, convoy, this, gave, them, much, greater, tactical, flexibility, allowing, them, to, detach, ships, to, hunt, submarines, spotted, by, reconnaissance, or, picked, up, by, hf, df, where, regular, escorts, would, have, to, break, off, and, stay, with, their, convoy, the, support, group, ships, could, keep, hunting, a, u, boat, for, many, hours, one, tactic, introduced, by, captain, john, walker, was, the, hold, down, where, a, group, of, ships, would, patrol, over, a, submerged, u, boat, until, its, air, ran, out, and, it, was, forced, to, the, surface, this, might, take, two, or, three, days, after, convoy, on, 154, winter, weather, provided, a, brief, respite, from, the, fighting, in, january, before, convoys, sc, 118, and, on, 166, in, february, 1943, but, in, the, spring, convoy, battles, started, up, again, with, the, same, ferocity, there, were, so, many, u, boats, on, patrol, in, the, north, atlantic, it, was, difficult, for, convoys, to, evade, detection, resulting, in, a, succession, of, vicious, battles, between, february, 1942, and, july, 1945, about, 5, 000, naval, officers, played, war, games, at, western, approaches, tactical, unit, many, game, graduates, believed, that, the, battle, they, fought, on, the, linoleum, floor, was, essential, to, their, subsequent, victory, at, sea, in, november, 1942, admiral, horton, tested, beta, search, in, a, wargame, janet, okell, and, jean, laidlaw, played, the, role, of, the, escorts, five, times, in, a, row, okell, and, laidlaw, sank, the, submarine, of, admiral, horton, the, commander, in, chief, of, western, approaches, at, the, start, of, world, war, ii, the, depth, charge, was, the, only, weapon, available, to, a, vessel, for, destroying, a, submerged, submarine, depth, charges, were, dropped, over, the, stern, and, thrown, to, the, side, of, a, warship, travelling, at, speed, early, models, of, asdic, sonar, searched, only, ahead, astern, and, to, the, sides, of, the, anti, submarine, vessel, that, was, using, it, there, was, no, downward, looking, capability, so, there, was, a, time, lag, between, the, last, fix, obtained, on, the, submarine, and, the, warship, reaching, a, point, above, that, position, then, the, depth, charges, had, to, sink, to, the, depth, at, which, they, were, set, to, explode, during, those, two, delays, a, capable, submarine, commander, would, manoeuvre, rapidly, to, a, different, position, and, avoid, the, attack, the, depth, charges, then, left, an, area, of, disturbed, water, through, which, it, was, difficult, to, regain, asdic, sonar, contact, in, response, to, this, problem, one, of, the, solutions, developed, by, the, royal, navy, was, the, ahead, throwing, anti, submarine, weapon, the, first, of, which, was, hedgehog, hedgehog, was, a, multiple, spigot, mortar, which, fired, contact, fused, bombs, ahead, of, the, firing, ship, while, the, target, was, still, within, the, asdic, beam, these, started, to, be, installed, on, anti, submarine, ships, from, late, 1942, the, warship, could, approach, slowly, as, it, did, not, have, to, clear, the, area, of, exploding, depth, charges, to, avoid, damage, and, so, its, position, was, less, obvious, to, the, submarine, commander, as, it, was, making, less, noise, because, hedgehog, only, exploded, if, it, hit, the, submarine, if, the, target, was, missed, there, was, no, disturbed, water, to, make, tracking, difficult, and, contact, had, not, been, lost, in, the, first, place, squid, was, an, improvement, on, hedgehog, introduced, in, late, 1943, a, three, barrelled, mortar, it, projected, 100, lb, 45, kg, charges, ahead, or, abeam, the, charges, firing, pistols, were, automatically, set, just, before, launch, the, more, advanced, installations, linked, squid, to, the, latest, asdic, sets, so, that, the, weapon, was, fired, automatically, detection, by, radar, equipped, aircraft, could, suppress, u, boat, activity, over, a, wide, area, but, an, aircraft, attack, could, only, be, successful, with, good, visibility, u, boats, were, relatively, safe, from, aircraft, at, night, for, two, reasons, 1, radar, then, in, use, could, not, detect, them, at, less, than, 1, mile, 1, 6, km, 2, flares, deployed, to, illuminate, any, attack, gave, adequate, warning, for, evasive, manoeuvres, the, introduction, of, the, leigh, light, by, the, british, in, january, 1942, solved, the, second, problem, thereby, becoming, a, significant, factor, in, the, battle, for, the, atlantic, developed, by, raf, officer, h, leigh, it, was, a, powerful, and, controllable, searchlight, mounted, primarily, to, wellington, bombers, and, b, 24, liberators, these, aircraft, first, located, enemy, submarines, using, air, to, surface, vessel, asv, radar, then, about, 1, mile, 1, 6, km, from, the, target, the, leigh, light, would, be, switched, on, it, immediately, and, accurately, illuminated, the, enemy, giving, u, boat, commanders, less, than, 25, seconds, to, react, before, they, were, attacked, with, depth, charges, the, first, confirmed, kill, using, this, technology, was, u, 502, on, july, 5, 1942, the, leigh, light, enabled, the, british, to, attack, enemy, subs, on, the, surface, at, night, forcing, german, and, italian, commanders, to, remain, underwater, especially, when, coming, into, port, at, sub, bases, in, the, bay, of, biscay, u, boat, commanders, who, survived, such, attacks, reported, a, particular, fear, of, this, weapon, since, aircraft, could, not, be, seen, at, night, and, the, noise, of, an, approaching, aircraft, was, inaudible, above, the, din, of, the, sub, s, engines, subsequently, the, common, practice, of, surfacing, at, night, to, recharge, batteries, and, refresh, air, was, mostly, abandoned, as, it, was, safer, to, perform, these, tasks, during, daylight, hours, when, enemy, planes, could, be, spotted, by, august, 1942, u, boats, were, being, fitted, with, radar, detectors, to, enable, them, to, avoid, ambushes, by, radar, equipped, aircraft, or, ships, the, first, such, receiver, named, metox, after, its, french, manufacturer, could, pick, up, the, metric, radar, bands, used, by, the, early, radars, this, enabled, u, boats, to, avoid, detection, by, canadian, escorts, which, were, equipped, with, obsolete, radar, sets, and, allowed, them, to, track, convoys, where, these, sets, were, in, use, however, it, also, caused, problems, for, the, germans, as, it, sometimes, detected, stray, radar, emissions, from, distant, ships, or, planes, leading, u, boats, to, submerge, when, they, were, not, in, actual, danger, preventing, them, from, recharging, batteries, or, using, their, surfaced, speed, metox, provided, the, u, boat, commander, with, an, advantage, that, had, not, been, anticipated, by, the, british, the, metox, set, beeped, at, the, pulse, rate, of, the, hunting, aircraft, s, radar, about, once, per, second, when, the, radar, operator, came, within, 9, miles, 14, km, of, the, u, boat, he, changed, the, range, of, his, radar, with, the, change, of, range, the, radar, doubled, its, pulse, frequency, and, as, a, result, the, metox, beeping, frequency, also, doubled, warning, the, commander, that, he, had, been, detected, and, that, the, approaching, aircraft, was, nine, miles, away, in, 1941, american, intelligence, informed, rear, admiral, john, henry, godfrey, that, the, uk, naval, codes, could, be, broken, in, march, 1942, the, germans, broke, naval, cipher, 3, the, code, for, anglo, american, communication, eighty, per, cent, of, the, admiralty, messages, from, march, 1942, to, june, 1943, were, read, by, the, germans, the, sinking, of, allied, merchant, ships, increased, dramatically, g, nter, hessler, admiral, d, nitz, s, son, in, law, and, first, staff, officer, at, u, boat, command, said, we, had, reached, a, stage, when, it, took, one, or, two, days, to, decrypt, the, british, radio, messages, on, occasions, only, a, few, hours, were, required, we, could, sometimes, deduce, when, and, how, they, would, take, advantage, of, the, gaps, in, our, u, boat, dispositions, our, function, was, to, close, those, gaps, just, before, the, convoys, were, due, the, code, breakers, of, bletchley, park, assigned, only, two, people, to, evaluate, whether, the, germans, broke, the, code, after, five, months, they, finally, determined, that, the, codes, were, broken, in, august, 1942, the, uk, admiralty, was, informed, however, the, admiralty, did, not, change, the, codes, until, june, 1943, captain, raymond, dreyer, deputy, staff, signals, officer, at, western, approaches, the, british, hq, for, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, in, liverpool, said, some, of, their, most, successful, u, boat, pack, attacks, on, our, convoys, were, based, on, information, obtained, by, breaking, our, ciphers, on, february, 1, 1942, the, kriegsmarine, switched, the, u, boats, to, a, new, enigma, network, triton, that, used, the, new, four, rotor, enigma, machines, this, new, key, could, not, be, read, by, codebreakers, the, allies, no, longer, knew, where, the, u, boat, patrol, lines, were, this, made, it, far, more, difficult, to, evade, contact, and, the, wolf, packs, ravaged, many, convoys, this, state, persisted, for, ten, months, to, obtain, information, on, submarine, movements, the, allies, had, to, make, do, with, hf, df, fixes, and, decrypts, of, kriegsmarine, messages, encoded, on, earlier, enigma, machines, these, messages, included, signals, from, coastal, forces, about, u, boat, arrivals, and, departures, at, their, bases, in, france, and, the, reports, from, the, u, boat, training, command, from, these, clues, commander, rodger, winn, s, admiralty, submarine, tracking, room, supplied, their, best, estimates, of, submarine, movements, but, this, information, was, not, enough, then, on, october, 30, crewmen, from, hms, petard, salvaged, enigma, material, from, german, submarine, u, 559, as, she, foundered, off, port, said, this, allowed, the, codebreakers, to, break, triton, by, december, 1942, enigma, decrypts, were, again, disclosing, u, boat, patrol, positions, and, shipping, losses, declined, dramatically, once, more, on, march, 10, 1943, the, germans, added, a, refinement, to, the, u, boat, enigma, key, which, blinded, the, allied, codebreakers, at, bletchley, park, for, 9, days, that, month, saw, the, battles, of, convoys, ugs, 6, hx, 228, sc, 121, sc, 122, and, hx, 229, one, hundred, and, twenty, ships, were, sunk, worldwide, 82, ships, of, 476, 000, tons, in, the, atlantic, while, 12, u, boats, were, destroyed, the, supply, situation, in, britain, was, such, that, there, was, talk, of, being, unable, to, continue, the, war, with, supplies, of, fuel, being, particularly, low, the, situation, was, so, bad, that, the, british, considered, abandoning, convoys, entirely, the, next, two, months, saw, a, complete, reversal, of, fortunes, in, april, losses, of, u, boats, increased, while, their, kills, fell, significantly, only, 39, ships, of, 235, 000, tons, were, sunk, in, the, atlantic, and, 15, u, boats, were, destroyed, by, may, wolf, packs, no, longer, had, the, advantage, and, that, month, became, known, as, black, may, in, the, u, boat, arm, u, bootwaffe, the, turning, point, was, the, battle, centred, on, slow, convoy, ons, 5, april, may, 1943, made, up, of, 43, merchantmen, escorted, by, 16, warships, it, was, attacked, by, a, pack, of, 30, u, boats, although, 13, merchant, ships, were, lost, six, u, boats, were, sunk, by, the, escorts, or, allied, aircraft, despite, a, storm, which, scattered, the, convoy, the, merchantmen, reached, the, protection, of, land, based, air, cover, causing, d, nitz, to, call, off, the, attack, two, weeks, later, sc, 130, saw, at, least, three, u, boats, destroyed, and, at, least, one, u, boat, damaged, for, no, losses, faced, with, disaster, d, nitz, called, off, operations, in, the, north, atlantic, saying, we, had, lost, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, on, 13, april, raf, coastal, command, started, its, second, bay, offensive, with, operation, derange, seventy, five, long, range, aircraft, equipped, with, the, new, centrimetric, asv, mark, iii, radar, with, ppi, display, patrolled, regions, in, the, bay, of, biscay, with, known, concentrations, through, enigma, decrypts, of, u, boats, in, transit, the, german, metox, radar, detector, operated, only, in, the, metric, band, and, did, not, detect, the, new, centrimetric, radar, emissions, as, a, result, many, u, boats, were, surprised, and, attacked, in, response, d, nitz, ordered, his, u, boats, to, stay, on, the, surface, and, fight, it, out, with, the, aircraft, some, u, boats, were, converted, to, flak, boats, with, extra, and, new, anti, aircraft, guns, but, to, no, avail, in, may, five, u, boats, were, sunk, and, another, seven, were, forced, to, abort, in, all, 43, u, boats, were, destroyed, in, may, 34, in, the, atlantic, this, was, 25, of, german, u, boat, arm, s, total, operational, strength, the, allies, lost, 58, ships, in, the, same, period, 34, of, these, totalling, 134, 000, tons, in, the, atlantic, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, was, won, by, the, allies, in, two, months, there, was, no, single, reason, for, this, what, had, changed, was, a, sudden, convergence, of, technologies, combined, with, an, increase, in, allied, resources, the, mid, atlantic, gap, that, had, previously, been, unreachable, by, aircraft, was, closed, by, long, range, b, 24, liberators, on, 18, march, 1943, roosevelt, ordered, king, to, transfer, 60, liberators, from, the, pacific, theatre, to, the, atlantic, to, combat, german, u, boats, one, of, only, two, direct, orders, he, gave, to, his, military, commanders, in, wwii, the, other, was, regarding, operation, torch, at, the, may, 1943, trident, conference, admiral, king, requested, general, henry, h, arnold, to, send, a, squadron, of, asw, configured, b, 24s, to, newfoundland, to, strengthen, the, air, escort, of, north, atlantic, convoys, general, arnold, ordered, his, squadron, commander, to, engage, only, in, offensive, search, and, attack, missions, and, not, in, the, escort, of, convoys, in, june, general, arnold, suggested, the, navy, assume, responsibility, for, asw, operations, admiral, king, requested, the, army, s, asw, configured, b, 24s, in, exchange, for, an, equal, number, of, unmodified, navy, b, 24s, agreement, was, reached, in, july, and, the, exchange, was, completed, in, september, 1943, further, air, cover, was, provided, by, the, introduction, of, merchant, aircraft, carriers, mac, ships, and, later, the, growing, numbers, of, american, built, escort, carriers, primarily, flying, grumman, f4f, wildcats, and, grumman, tbf, avengers, they, sailed, with, the, convoys, and, provided, much, needed, air, cover, and, patrols, all, the, way, across, the, atlantic, larger, numbers, of, escorts, became, available, both, as, a, result, of, american, building, programmes, and, the, release, of, escorts, committed, to, the, north, african, landings, during, november, and, december, 1942, in, particular, destroyer, escorts, des, similar, british, ships, were, known, as, frigates, were, designed, to, be, built, economically, compared, to, fleet, destroyers, and, sloops, whose, warship, standards, construction, and, sophisticated, armaments, made, them, too, expensive, for, mass, production, destroyer, escorts, and, frigates, were, also, better, designed, for, mid, ocean, anti, submarine, warfare, than, corvettes, which, although, maneuverable, and, seaworthy, were, too, short, slow, and, inadequately, armed, to, match, the, des, not, only, would, there, be, sufficient, numbers, of, escorts, to, securely, protect, convoys, they, could, also, form, hunter, killer, groups, often, centred, on, escort, carriers, to, aggressively, hunt, u, boats, during, may, 1943, the, us, navy, began, using, a, high, speed, bombe, of, its, own, design, which, could, deduce, the, settings, of, the, new, four, rotor, german, enigma, cipher, machines, by, september, 1944, 121, of, the, new, high, speed, bombes, were, at, work, d, nitz, s, aim, in, this, tonnage, war, was, to, sink, allied, ships, faster, than, they, could, be, replaced, as, losses, fell, and, production, rose, particularly, in, the, united, states, this, became, impossible, despite, u, boat, operations, in, the, region, centred, in, the, atlantic, narrows, between, brazil, and, west, africa, beginning, autumn, 1940, only, in, the, following, year, did, these, start, to, raise, serious, concern, in, washington, this, perceived, threat, caused, the, us, to, decide, that, the, introduction, of, us, forces, along, brazil, s, coast, would, be, valuable, after, negotiations, with, brazilian, foreign, minister, osvaldo, aranha, on, behalf, of, dictator, get, lio, vargas, these, were, introduced, in, second, half, of, 1941, germany, and, italy, subsequently, extended, their, submarine, attacks, to, include, brazilian, ships, wherever, they, were, and, from, april, 1942, were, found, in, brazilian, waters, on, 22, may, 1942, the, first, brazilian, attack, although, unsuccessful, was, carried, out, by, brazilian, air, force, aircraft, on, the, italian, submarine, barbarigo, after, a, series, of, attacks, on, merchant, vessels, off, the, brazilian, coast, by, u, 507, brazil, officially, entered, the, war, on, 22, august, 1942, offering, an, important, addition, to, the, allied, strategic, position, in, the, south, atlantic, although, the, brazilian, navy, was, small, it, had, modern, minelayers, suitable, for, coastal, convoy, escort, and, aircraft, which, needed, only, small, modifications, to, become, suitable, for, maritime, patrol, during, its, three, years, of, war, mainly, in, caribbean, and, south, atlantic, alone, and, in, conjunction, with, the, us, brazil, escorted, 3, 167, ships, in, 614, convoys, totalling, 16, 500, 000, tons, with, losses, of, 0, 1, nine, hundred, and, seventy, two, seamen, and, civilian, passengers, were, lost, aboard, the, 32, brazilian, merchant, vessels, attacked, by, enemy, submarines, american, and, brazilian, air, and, naval, forces, worked, closely, together, until, the, end, of, the, battle, one, example, was, the, sinking, of, u, 199, in, july, 1943, by, a, coordinated, action, of, brazilian, and, american, aircraft, in, brazilian, waters, eleven, other, axis, submarines, were, known, to, be, sunk, between, january, and, september, 1943, the, italian, archimede, and, ten, german, boats, u, 128, u, 161, u, 164, u, 507, u, 513, u, 590, u, 591, u, 598, u, 604, and, u, 662, by, fall, 1943, the, decreasing, number, of, allied, shipping, losses, in, the, south, atlantic, coincided, with, the, increasing, elimination, of, axis, submarines, operating, there, from, then, on, the, battle, in, the, region, was, lost, by, germany, even, though, most, of, the, remaining, submarines, in, the, region, received, an, official, order, of, withdrawal, only, in, august, of, the, following, year, and, with, baron, jedburgh, the, last, allied, merchant, ship, sunk, by, a, u, boat, u, 532, there, on, 10, march, 1945, after, the, defeat, on, the, north, atlantic, convoy, lanes, it, became, clear, to, d, nitz, and, hitler, that, a, new, generation, of, u, boats, was, urgently, needed, there, was, a, program, to, develop, walter, u, boats, which, achieved, high, underwater, speeds, with, a, revolutionary, hydrogen, peroxide, air, independent, propellant, system, but, this, program, faced, many, technical, setbacks, and, these, u, boats, would, not, become, available, in, time, instead, it, was, decided, to, modify, these, designs, where, the, new, propulsion, system, was, replaced, with, much, larger, battery, capacity, for, a, conventional, u, boat, propulsion, system, the, elektroboot, types, since, the, design, was, ready, it, was, hoped, that, by, massproducing, the, u, boat, in, prefabricated, sections, these, new, type, xxi, oceangoing, and, coastal, type, xxiii, would, become, operational, in, the, summer, of, 1944, in, the, meantime, as, a, stopgap, measure, until, these, elektroboote, became, available, the, existing, u, boat, designs, were, gradually, equipped, with, a, schnorchel, snorkels, which, allowed, u, boats, to, run, their, diesel, engines, whilst, submerged, and, recharge, their, batteries, the, u, boats, left, the, north, atlantic, convoy, lanes, and, shifted, their, attacks, to, the, american, mediterranean, convoys, in, the, central, atlantic, the, allies, learned, from, this, move, through, intelligence, and, anticipated, by, ordering, three, us, navy, task, groups, centred, around, the, escort, carriers, card, bogue, and, santee, to, the, region, these, escort, carriers, protected, the, convoys, but, were, not, part, of, its, close, escort, and, were, allowed, to, search, and, destroy, u, boats, and, their, supporting, u, boat, tankers, on, hf, df, bearings, only, 1, ship, was, lost, but, the, escort, carriers, sank, 17, u, boats, after, this, defeat, d, nitz, halted, all, wolfpack, operations, in, the, beginning, of, august, until, u, boats, could, be, upgraded, with, better, weapons, and, measures, at, the, same, time, the, british, were, allowed, to, access, the, harbors, at, the, portuguese, azores, islands, and, to, operate, allied, military, aircraft, based, in, the, azores, islands, which, closed, the, air, gap, in, the, mid, atlantic, and, made, operations, there, equally, hazardous, during, this, period, june, september, 1943, coastal, command, kept, up, its, bay, offensive, with, operations, musketry, seaslug, and, percusion, by, the, first, week, of, august, 41, u, boats, were, sunk, in, the, bay, of, biscay, the, bay, offensive, was, intensified, by, sending, escort, and, support, groups, into, the, bay, but, these, ships, were, finally, driven, off, by, german, dornier, do, 217, aircraft, armed, with, henschel, hs, 293, guided, glide, bomb, which, claimed, a, number, of, victims, in, september, 1943, d, nitz, hoped, to, surprise, the, allies, by, sending, the, wolfpack, leuthen, back, to, the, north, atlantic, convoy, lanes, these, u, boats, were, equipped, with, t5, zaunk, nig, acoustic, torpedoes, better, anti, aircraft, guns, a, new, wanze, radar, detector, and, afrodite, radar, decoys, in, an, adaptation, of, their, wolfpack, tactics, they, were, ordered, first, to, attack, convoy, escorts, with, their, acoustic, torpedoes, before, attacking, the, merchants, the, group, achieved, surprise, and, success, in, its, first, attack, on, convoys, ons, 18, and, on, 202, but, all, subsequent, attacks, were, beaten, off, with, heavy, loss, for, the, germans, other, wolfpacks, rossbach, schlieffen, and, siegfried, were, formed, and, kept, the, new, campaign, going, but, could, achieve, little, for, heavy, losses, only, eight, ships, of, 56, 000, tons, and, six, warships, had, been, sunk, for, the, loss, of, 39, u, boats, a, catastrophic, loss, ratio, in, november, d, nitz, finally, recognized, wolfpack, attacks, were, not, viable, anymore, in, the, face, of, heavy, convoy, escort, and, dispersed, his, u, boats, from, january, 1944, onwards, d, nitz, tried, to, preserve, his, u, boat, strength, in, order, to, be, able, to, repel, an, expected, invasion, in, both, norway, and, france, the, number, of, patrols, by, his, atlantic, u, boats, fell, from, 41, in, january, to, just, 10, in, may, however, since, u, boats, were, still, diverted, to, the, mediterranean, or, kept, in, reserve, in, norway, and, since, operational, losses, were, high, the, number, of, available, u, boats, in, the, atlantic, force, sank, in, the, same, period, from, 121, to, 89, d, nitz, had, hoped, the, elektroboote, could, pick, up, the, offensive, on, the, convoy, lanes, again, in, 1944, but, the, construction, of, these, boats, got, delayed, by, shortages, of, skilled, workers, and, allied, bombing, on, shipyards, and, u, boat, engine, factories, only, in, april, 1944, was, the, first, type, xxi, launched, and, its, submerged, speed, and, diving, depth, proved, to, be, inferior, to, the, designed, performance, on, d, day, atlantic, operations, were, suspended, all, available, 36, u, boats, later, reinforced, with, another, seven, were, sent, out, to, confront, operation, neptune, for, the, loss, of, thirteen, of, their, own, these, u, boats, sank, only, eight, of, the, 5, 339, vessels, participating, in, the, invasion, of, normandy, air, patrols, made, operations, for, u, boats, not, equipped, with, a, schnorkel, impossible, and, these, had, to, be, recalled, a, further, eleven, schnorkel, u, boats, arrived, from, norway, in, the, second, week, of, the, invasion, but, they, sank, only, two, ships, for, the, loss, of, seven, u, boats, with, the, allied, advance, in, france, the, u, boat, bases, in, brest, and, bordeaux, were, lost, in, august, september, the, other, three, bases, in, lorient, st, nazaire, and, la, pallice, were, evacuated, but, remained, in, german, hands, until, the, end, of, the, war, no, operations, could, be, mounted, from, these, bases, however, the, remaining, 30, u, boats, were, evacuated, to, norway, between, 16, may, and, 1, november, 72, u, boats, were, lost, whilst, they, could, only, sink, twelve, small, warships, and, fourteen, merchant, ships, for, 60, 000, tons, norway, was, too, far, away, from, the, convoy, lanes, in, order, to, organise, group, attacks, by, the, schnorkel, u, boats, in, order, to, keep, up, the, offensive, pending, the, arrival, of, the, elektroboote, 68, patrols, were, organised, from, norway, towards, british, waters, between, july, and, december, 1944, only, schnorkel, type, vii, u, boats, could, be, used, as, allied, air, superiority, excluded, continuous, cruising, on, surface, sixteen, u, boats, were, lost, in, the, same, period, seventeen, of, the, longer, range, type, ix, u, boats, were, sent, to, canada, and, the, azores, these, u, boats, had, also, schnorkels, and, were, equipped, with, new, technology, they, had, new, fliege, and, m, cke, radar, detectors, and, a, new, hohentwiel, search, radar, they, sank, six, warships, and, nine, merchants, ships, for, the, loss, of, seven, u, boats, in, 1945, d, nitz, continued, with, the, same, approach, type, vii, schnorkel, u, boats, mounted, 113, patrols, to, british, waters, from, norway, and, germany, sixty, five, u, boats, were, lost, by, the, end, of, the, war, another, nineteen, type, ix, u, boats, sailed, for, the, americas, these, u, boats, sank, three, small, warships, and, three, merchants, for, the, loss, of, nine, of, their, own, of, the, much, awaited, elektroboote, only, five, type, xxiii, coastal, elektroboote, made, seven, patrols, in, 1945, which, sank, five, small, freighters, only, one, of, the, big, type, xxi, elektroboote, embarked, upon, a, patrol, before, the, end, of, the, war, but, it, did, not, see, action, in, the, last, month, of, the, war, many, u, boats, fled, the, baltic, ports, as, they, were, overrun, by, the, russian, army, eight, elektroboote, and, nine, other, u, boats, were, sunk, by, allied, aircraft, as, they, fled, towards, bases, in, norway, the, last, actions, in, american, waters, took, place, on, may, 5, 6, 1945, which, saw, the, sinking, of, the, steamer, black, point, and, the, destruction, of, u, 853, and, u, 881, in, separate, incidents, the, last, actions, of, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, were, on, may, 7, 8, u, 320, was, the, last, u, boat, sunk, in, action, by, an, raf, catalina, while, the, norwegian, minesweeper, nyms, 382, and, the, freighters, sneland, i, and, avondale, park, were, torpedoed, in, separate, incidents, just, hours, before, the, german, surrender, at, the, war, s, end, 222, u, boats, were, scuttled, by, their, crews, the, remaining, 174, u, boats, at, sea, or, in, port, were, surrendered, to, the, allies, most, were, destroyed, in, operation, deadlight, after, the, war, but, some, served, in, allied, navies, six, were, in, japan, at, the, time, of, the, german, surrender, and, were, captured, by, the, japanese, the, development, of, torpedoes, also, improved,

german, naval, acoustic, torpedo, gnat, which, homed, on, the, propeller, noise, of, a, target, this, was, initially, very, effective, but, the, allies, quickly, developed, counter, measures, both, tactical, step, aside, and, technical, foxer, the, germans, failed, to, stop, the, flow, of, strategic, supplies, to, britain, this, failure, resulted, in, the, build, up, of, troops, and, supplies, needed, for, the, d, day, landings, the, defeat, of, the, u, boat, was, a, necessary, precursor, for, accumulation, of, allied, troops, and, supplies, to, ensure, germany, s, defeat, between, 1939,

this, was, because, most, of, the, ships, sunk, by, u, boats, were, not, in, convoys, but, sailing, alone, or, having, become, separated, from, convoys, at, no, time, during, the, campaign, were,

this, target, while, after, december, 1941, when, britain, was, joined, by, the, us, merchant, marine, and, ship, yards, the, target, effectively, doubled, as, a, result, the, axis, needed, to, sink, 700, 000, grt, per, month, as, the, massive, expansion, of, the, us, shipbuilding, industry, took, effect, this, target, increased, still, further, the, 700, 000, ton, target, was, achieved, in, only, one, month, november, 1942, while, after, may, 1943, average, sinkings, dropped, to, less, than, one, tenth, of, that, figure, by, the, end, of, the, war, the, allies, had, built, over, 38, million, tons, of, new, shipping, the, reason, for, the, misperception, that, the, german, blockade, came, close, to, success, may, be, found, in, post, war, writings, by, both, german, and, british, authors, blair, attributes, the, distortion, to, propagandists, who, glorified, and, exaggerated, the, successes, of, german, submariners, while, he, believes, allied, writers, had, their, own, reasons, for, exaggerating, the, peril, dan, van, der, vat, suggests, that, unlike, the, us, or, canada, and, britain, s, other, dominions, which, were, protected, by, oceanic, distances, britain, was, at, the, end, of, the, transatlantic, supply, route, closest, to, german, bases, for, britain, it, was, a, lifeline, it, is, this, which, led, to, churchill, s, concerns, coupled, with, a, series, of, major, convoy, battles, in, the, space, of, a, month, it, undermined, confidence, in, the, convoy, system, in, march, 1943, to, the, point, britain, considered, abandoning, it, not, realising, the, u, boat, had, already, effectively, been, defeated, these, were, over, pessimistic, threat, assessments, blair, concludes, at, no, time, did, the, german, u, boat, force, ever, come, close, to, winning, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, or, bringing, on, the, collapse, of, great, britain, historians, disagree, about, the, relative, importance, of, the, anti, u, boat, measures, max, hastings, states, that, in, 1941, alone, ultra, saved, between, 1, 5, and, two, million, tons, of, allied, ships, from, destruction, this, would, be, a, 40, per, cent, to, 53, per, cent, reduction, a, history, based, on, the, german, archives, written, for, the, british, admiralty, after, the, war, by, a, former, u, boat, commander, and, son, in, law, of, d, nitz, reports, that, several, detailed, investigations, to, discover, whether, their, operations, were, compromised, by, broken, code, were, negative, and, that, their, defeat, was, due, firstly, to, outstanding, developments, in, enemy, radar, the, graphs, of, the, data, are, colour, coded, to, divide, the, battle, into, three, epochs, before, the, breaking, of, the, enigma, code, after, it, was, broken, and, after, the, introduction, of, centimetric, radar, which, could, reveal, submarine, conning, towers, above, the, surface, of, the, water, and, even, detect, periscopes, obviously, this, subdivision, of, the, data, ignores, many, other, defensive, measures, the, allies, developed, during, the, war, so, interpretation, must, be, constrained, codebreaking, by, itself, did, not, decrease, the, losses, which, continued, to, rise, ominously, more, u, boats, were, sunk, but, the, number, operational, had, more, than, tripled, after, the, improved, radar, came, into, action, shipping, losses, plummeted, reaching, a, level, significantly, p, 0, 99, below, the, early, months, of, the, war, the, development, of, the, improved, radar, by, the, allies, began, in, 1940, before, the, united, states, entered, the, war, when, henry, tizard, and, a, v, hill, won, permission, to, share, british, secret, research, with, the, americans, including, bringing, them, a, cavity, magnetron, which, generates, the, needed, high, frequency, radio, waves, all, sides, will, agree, with, hastings, that, mobilization, of, the, best, civilian, brains, and, their, integration, into, the, war, effort, at, the, highest, levels, was, an, outstanding, british, success, story
