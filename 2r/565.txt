conflict, between, the, ottoman, empire, and, a, coalition, led, by, the, russian, empire, which, included, bulgaria, romania, serbia, and, montenegro, additional, factors, included, the, russian, goals, of, recovering, territorial, losses, endured, during, the, crimean, war, of, 1853, 1856, re, establishing, itself, in, the, black, sea, and, supporting, the, political, movement, attempting, to, free, balkan, nations, from, the, ottoman, empire, the, russian, led, coalition, won, the, war, pushing, the, ottomans, back, all, the, way, to, the, gates, of, constantinople, leading, to, the, intervention, of, the, western, european, great, powers, as, a, result, russia, succeeded, in, claiming, provinces, in, the, caucasus, namely, kars, and, batum, and, also, annexed, the, budjak, region, the, principalities, of, romania, serbia, and, montenegro, each, of, which, had, had, de, facto, sovereignty, for, some, years, formally, proclaimed, independence, from, the, ottoman, empire, after, almost, five, centuries, of, ottoman, domination, 1396, 1878, bulgaria, emerged, as, an, autonomous, state, with, support, and, military, intervention, from, russia, article, 9, of, the, 1856, paris, peace, treaty, concluded, at, the, end, of, the, crimean, war, obliged, the, ottoman, empire, to, grant, christians, equal, rights, with, muslims, before, the, treaty, was, signed, the, ottoman, government, issued, an, edict, the, edict, of, g, lhane, which, proclaimed, the, principle, of, the, equality, of, muslims, and, non, muslims, and, produced, some, specific, reforms, to, this, end, for, example, the, jizya, tax, was, abolished, and, non, muslims, were, allowed, to, join, the, army, in, 1858, stirred, by, their, clergy, the, maronite, peasants, of, northern, lebanon, revolted, against, their, predominantly, druze, feudal, overlords, and, established, a, peasant, republic, in, southern, beirut, vilayet, where, both, maronite, and, druze, peasants, worked, under, druze, overlords, druze, peasants, sided, with, their, co, religious, and, against, the, maronites, transforming, the, conflict, into, a, civil, war, although, both, sides, suffered, about, 10, 000, maronites, were, massacred, at, the, hands, of, the, druze, fearing, european, intervention, the, ottoman, foreign, minister, mehmed, fuad, pasha, was, dispatched, to, syria, and, immediately, set, about, trying, to, resolve, the, conflict, as, swiftly, as, possible, mehmed, sought, out, and, executed, the, agitators, on, all, sides, including, the, governor, and, other, officials, order, was, soon, restored, and, preparations, made, to, give, lebanon, new, autonomy, these, efforts, were, ultimately, not, enough, to, prevent, european, intervention, however, with, france, deploying, a, fleet, in, september, 1860, fearing, that, a, unilateral, intervention, would, increase, french, influence, in, the, region, at, their, expense, the, british, joined, the, french, expedition, faced, with, further, european, pressure, the, sultan, agreed, to, appoint, a, christian, governor, in, lebanon, whose, candidacy, was, to, be, submitted, by, the, sultan, and, approved, by, the, european, powers, the, cretan, revolt, which, began, in, 1866, resulted, from, the, failure, of, the, ottoman, empire, to, apply, reforms, for, improving, the, life, of, the, population, and, the, cretans, desire, for, enosis, union, with, greece, the, insurgents, gained, control, over, the, whole, island, except, for, five, fortified, cities, where, the, muslims, took, refuge, the, greek, press, claimed, that, muslims, had, massacred, greeks, and, the, word, was, spread, throughout, europe, thousands, of, greek, volunteers, were, mobilized, and, sent, to, the, island, the, siege, of, arkadi, monastery, became, particularly, well, known, in, november, 1866, about, 250, cretan, greek, combatants, and, around, 600, women, and, children, were, besieged, by, about, 23, 000, mainly, cretan, muslims, aided, by, ottoman, troops, and, this, became, widely, known, in, europe, after, a, bloody, battle, with, a, large, number, of, casualties, on, both, sides, the, cretan, greeks, finally, surrendered, when, their, ammunition, ran, out, but, were, killed, upon, surrender, by, early, 1869, the, insurrection, was, suppressed, but, the, porte, offered, some, concessions, introducing, island, self, rule, and, increasing, christian, rights, on, the, island, although, the, cretan, crisis, ended, better, for, the, ottomans, than, almost, any, other, diplomatic, confrontation, of, the, century, the, insurrection, and, especially, the, brutality, with, which, it, was, suppressed, led, to, greater, public, attention, in, europe, to, the, oppression, of, christians, in, the, ottoman, empire, small, as, the, amount, of, attention, is, which, can, be, given, by, the, people, of, england, to, the, affairs, of, turkey, enough, was, transpiring, from, time, to, time, to, produce, a, vague, but, a, settled, and, general, impression, that, the, sultans, were, not, fulfilling, the, solemn, promises, they, had, made, to, europe, that, the, vices, of, the, turkish, government, were, ineradicable, and, that, whenever, another, crisis, might, arise, affecting, the, independence, of, the, ottoman, empire, it, would, be, wholly, impossible, to, afford, to, it, again, the, support, we, had, afforded, in, the, crimean, war, although, on, the, winning, side, in, the, crimean, war, the, ottoman, empire, continued, to, decline, in, power, and, prestige, the, financial, strain, on, the, treasury, forced, the, ottoman, government, to, take, a, series, of, foreign, loans, at, such, steep, interest, rates, that, despite, all, the, fiscal, reforms, that, followed, pushed, it, into, unpayable, debts, and, economic, difficulties, this, was, further, aggravated, by, the, need, to, accommodate, more, than, 600, 000, muslim, circassians, expelled, by, the, russians, from, the, caucasus, to, the, black, sea, ports, of, north, anatolia, and, the, balkan, ports, of, constan, a, and, varna, which, cost, a, great, deal, in, money, and, in, civil, disorder, to, the, ottoman, authorities, the, concert, of, europe, established, in, 1814, was, shaken, in, 1859, when, france, and, austria, fought, over, italy, it, came, apart, completely, as, a, result, of, the, wars, of, german, unification, when, the, kingdom, of, prussia, led, by, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, defeated, austria, in, 1866, and, france, in, 1870, replacing, austria, as, the, dominant, power, in, central, europe, britain, diverted, by, the, irish, question, and, averse, to, warfare, chose, not, to, intervene, again, to, restore, the, european, balance, bismarck, did, not, wish, the, breakup, of, the, ottoman, empire, to, create, rivalries, that, might, lead, to, war, so, he, took, up, tsar, alexander, ii, of, russia, s, earlier, suggestion, that, arrangements, be, made, in, case, the, ottoman, empire, fell, apart, creating, the, three, emperors, league, with, austria, hungary, and, russia, to, keep, france, isolated, on, the, continent, france, responded, by, supporting, self, determination, movements, particularly, if, they, concerned, the, three, emperors, and, the, sultan, thus, revolts, in, poland, against, russia, and, national, aspirations, in, the, balkans, were, encouraged, by, france, russia, worked, to, regain, its, right, to, maintain, a, fleet, on, the, black, sea, and, vied, with, the, french, in, gaining, influence, in, the, balkans, by, using, the, new, pan, slavic, idea, that, all, slavs, should, be, united, under, russian, leadership, this, could, be, done, only, by, destroying, the, two, empires, where, most, non, russian, slavs, lived, the, habsburg, and, the, ottoman, empires, the, ambitions, and, the, rivalries, of, the, russians, and, french, in, the, balkans, surfaced, in, serbia, which, was, experiencing, its, own, national, revival, and, had, ambitions, that, partly, conflicted, with, those, of, the, great, powers, russia, ended, the, crimean, war, with, minimal, territorial, losses, but, was, forced, to, destroy, its, black, sea, fleet, and, sevastopol, fortifications, russian, international, prestige, was, damaged, and, for, many, years, revenge, for, the, crimean, war, became, the, main, goal, of, russian, foreign, policy, this, was, not, easy, though, the, paris, peace, treaty, included, guarantees, of, ottoman, territorial, integrity, by, great, britain, france, and, austria, and, only, prussia, remained, friendly, to, russia, the, newly, appointed, russian, chancellor, alexander, gorchakov, depended, upon, alliance, with, prussia, and, its, chancellor, bismarck, russia, consistently, supported, prussia, in, her, wars, with, denmark, 1864, austria, 1866, and, france, 1870, in, march, 1871, using, the, crushing, french, defeat, and, the, support, of, a, grateful, germany, russia, achieved, international, recognition, of, its, earlier, denouncement, of, article, 11, of, the, paris, peace, treaty, thus, enabling, it, to, revive, the, black, sea, fleet, other, clauses, of, the, paris, peace, treaty, however, remained, in, force, specifically, article, 8, with, guarantees, of, ottoman, territorial, integrity, by, great, britain, france, and, austria, therefore, russia, was, extremely, cautious, in, its, relations, with, the, ottoman, empire, coordinating, all, its, actions, with, other, european, powers, a, russian, war, with, turkey, would, require, at, least, the, tacit, support, of, all, other, great, powers, and, russian, diplomacy, was, waiting, for, a, convenient, moment, in, 1875, a, series, of, balkan, events, brought, europe, to, the, brink, of, war, the, state, of, ottoman, administration, in, the, balkans, continued, to, deteriorate, throughout, the, 19th, century, with, the, central, government, occasionally, losing, control, over, whole, provinces, reforms, imposed, by, european, powers, did, little, to, improve, the, conditions, of, the, christian, population, while, managing, to, dissatisfy, a, sizable, portion, of, the, muslim, population, bosnia, and, herzegovina, suffered, at, least, two, waves, of, rebellion, by, the, local, muslim, population, the, most, recent, ending, in, 1862, austria, hungary, consolidated, after, the, turmoil, of, the, first, half, of, the, century, and, sought, to, reinvigorate, its, centuries, long, policy, of, expansion, at, the, expense, of, the, ottoman, empire, meanwhile, the, nominally, autonomous, de, facto, independent, principalities, of, serbia, and, montenegro, also, sought, to, expand, into, regions, inhabited, by, their, compatriots, nationalist, and, irredentist, sentiments, were, strong, and, were, encouraged, by, russia, and, her, agents, at, the, same, time, a, severe, drought, in, anatolia, in, 1873, and, flooding, in, 1874, caused, famine, and, widespread, discontent, in, the, heart, of, the, empire, the, agricultural, shortages, precluded, the, collection, of, necessary, taxes, which, forced, the, ottoman, government, to, declare, bankruptcy, in, october, 1875, and, increase, taxes, on, outlying, provinces, including, the, balkans, istv, n, de, k, states, that, the, albanian, highlanders, resented, new, taxes, and, conscription, and, fought, against, the, ottomans, in, the, war, an, uprising, against, ottoman, rule, began, in, herzegovina, in, july, 1875, by, august, almost, all, of, herzegovina, had, been, seized, and, the, revolt, had, spread, into, bosnia, supported, by, nationalist, volunteers, from, serbia, and, montenegro, the, uprising, continued, as, the, ottomans, committed, more, and, more, troops, to, suppress, it, with, its, origin, in, the, vicinity, of, the, town, of, nevesinje, the, uprising, was, also, known, as, nevesinjska, pu, ka, the, rifle, of, nevesinje, the, revolt, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, spurred, bucharest, based, bulgarian, revolutionaries, into, action, in, 1875, a, bulgarian, uprising, was, hastily, prepared, to, take, advantage, of, ottoman, preoccupation, but, it, fizzled, before, it, started, in, the, spring, of, 1876, another, uprising, erupted, in, the, south, central, bulgarian, lands, despite, the, fact, that, there, were, numerous, regular, turkish, troops, in, those, areas, a, special, turkish, military, committee, was, established, to, quell, the, uprising, regular, troops, nizam, and, irregulars, redif, or, bashi, bazouk, were, directed, to, fight, the, bulgarians, 11, may, 9, june, 1876, the, irregulars, were, mostly, drawn, from, the, muslim, inhabitants, of, the, bulgarian, region, many, were, circassians, from, the, caucasus, or, crimean, tatars, who, were, expelled, during, the, crimean, war, some, were, islamized, bulgarians, the, ottoman, army, suppressed, the, revolt, massacring, up, to, 30, 000, people, in, the, process, five, thousand, out, of, the, seven, thousand, villagers, of, batak, were, put, to, death, both, batak, and, perushtitsa, where, the, majority, of, the, population, was, also, massacred, participated, in, the, rebellion, many, of, the, perpetrators, of, those, massacres, were, later, decorated, by, the, ottoman, high, command, modern, historians, have, estimated, the, number, of, murdered, bulgarians, at, between, 30, 000, and, 100, 000, word, of, the, bashi, bazouks, atrocities, filtered, to, the, outside, world, by, way, of, the, american, run, robert, college, located, in, constantinople, the, majority, of, the, students, were, bulgarian, and, many, received, news, of, the, events, from, their, families, back, home, soon, the, western, diplomatic, community, in, constantinople, was, abuzz, with, rumours, which, eventually, found, their, way, into, newspapers, in, the, west, while, in, constantinople, in, 1879, protestant, missionary, george, warren, wood, reported, turkish, authorities, in, amasia, brutally, persecuting, christian, armenian, refugees, from, soukoum, kaleh, he, was, able, to, coordinate, with, british, diplomat, edward, malet, to, bring, the, matter, to, the, attention, of, the, sublime, porte, and, then, to, the, british, foreign, secretary, robert, gascoyne, cecil, the, marquess, of, salisbury, in, britain, where, disraeli, s, government, was, committed, to, supporting, the, ottomans, in, the, ongoing, balkan, crisis, the, liberal, opposition, newspaper, the, daily, news, hired, american, journalist, januarius, a, macgahan, to, report, on, the, massacre, stories, first, hand, macgahan, toured, the, stricken, regions, of, the, bulgarian, uprising, and, his, report, splashed, across, the, daily, news, s, front, pages, galvanized, british, public, opinion, against, disraeli, s, pro, ottoman, policy, in, september, opposition, leader, william, ewart, gladstone, published, his, bulgarian, horrors, and, the, question, of, the, east, calling, upon, britain, to, withdraw, its, support, for, turkey, and, proposing, that, europe, demand, independence, for, bulgaria, and, bosnia, and, herzegovina, as, the, details, became, known, across, europe, many, dignitaries, including, charles, darwin, oscar, wilde, victor, hugo, and, giuseppe, garibaldi, publicly, condemned, the, ottoman, abuses, in, bulgaria, the, strongest, reaction, came, from, russia, widespread, sympathy, for, the, bulgarian, cause, led, to, a, nationwide, surge, in, patriotism, on, a, scale, comparable, with, the, one, during, the, patriotic, war, of, 1812, from, autumn, 1875, the, movement, to, support, the, bulgarian, uprising, involved, all, classes, of, russian, society, this, was, accompanied, by, sharp, public, discussions, about, russian, goals, in, this, conflict, slavophiles, including, fyodor, dostoevsky, saw, in, the, impending, war, the, chance, to, unite, all, orthodox, nations, under, russia, s, helm, thus, fulfilling, what, they, believed, was, the, historic, mission, of, russia, while, their, opponents, westernizers, inspired, by, ivan, turgenev, denied, the, importance, of, religion, and, believed, that, russian, goals, should, not, be, defense, of, orthodoxy, but, liberation, of, bulgaria, on, 30, june, 1876, serbia, followed, by, montenegro, declared, war, on, the, ottoman, empire, in, july, and, august, the, ill, prepared, and, poorly, equipped, serbian, army, helped, by, russian, volunteers, failed, to, achieve, offensive, objectives, but, did, manage, to, repulse, the, ottoman, offensive, into, serbia, meanwhile, alexander, ii, of, russia, and, prince, gorchakov, met, austria, hungary, s, franz, joseph, i, and, count, andr, ssy, in, the, reichstadt, castle, in, bohemia, no, written, agreement, was, made, but, during, the, discussions, russia, agreed, to, support, austrian, occupation, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, and, austria, hungary, in, exchange, agreed, to, support, the, return, of, southern, bessarabia, lost, by, russia, during, the, crimean, war, and, russian, annexation, of, the, port, of, batum, on, the, east, coast, of, the, black, sea, bulgaria, was, to, become, autonomous, independent, according, to, the, russian, records, as, the, fighting, in, bosnia, and, herzegovina, continued, serbia, suffered, a, string, of, setbacks, and, asked, the, european, powers, to, mediate, an, end, to, the, war, a, joint, ultimatum, by, the, european, powers, forced, the, porte, to, give, serbia, a, one, month, truce, and, start, peace, negotiations, turkish, peace, conditions, however, were, refused, by, european, powers, as, too, harsh, in, early, october, after, the, truce, expired, the, turkish, army, resumed, its, offensive, and, the, serbian, position, quickly, became, desperate, on, 31, october, russia, issued, an, ultimatum, requiring, the, ottoman, empire, to, stop, the, hostilities, and, sign, a, new, truce, with, serbia, within, 48, hours, this, was, supported, by, the, partial, mobilization, of, the, imperial, russian, army, up, to, 20, divisions, sultan, abdul, hamid, ii, accepted, the, conditions, of, the, ultimatum, to, resolve, the, crisis, on, 11, december, 1876, the, constantinople, conference, of, the, great, powers, was, opened, in, constantinople, to, which, ottoman, representatives, were, not, invited, a, compromise, solution, was, negotiated, granting, autonomy, to, bulgaria, bosnia, and, herzegovina, under, the, joint, control, of, european, powers, the, ottomans, however, refused, to, sacrifice, their, independence, by, allowing, international, representatives, to, oversee, the, institution, of, reforms, and, sought, to, discredit, the, conference, by, announcing, on, 23, december, the, day, the, conference, was, closed, that, a, constitution, was, adopted, that, declared, equal, rights, for, religious, minorities, within, the, empire, the, ottomans, attempted, to, use, this, manoeuver, to, get, their, objections, and, amendments, to, the, agreement, heard, when, they, were, rejected, by, the, great, powers, the, ottoman, empire, announced, its, decision, to, disregard, the, results, of, the, conference, on, 15, january, 1877, russia, and, austria, hungary, signed, a, written, agreement, confirming, the, results, of, the, earlier, reichstadt, agreement, of, july, 1876, this, assured, russia, of, the, benevolent, neutrality, of, austria, hungary, in, the, impending, war, these, terms, meant, that, in, case, of, war, russia, would, do, the, fighting, and, austria, hungary, would, derive, most, of, the, advantage, russia, therefore, made, a, final, effort, for, a, peaceful, settlement, after, reaching, an, agreement, with, its, main, balkan, rival, and, with, anti, ottoman, sympathies, running, high, throughout, europe, due, to, the, bulgarian, atrocities, and, the, rejection, of, the, constantinople, agreements, russia, finally, felt, free, to, declare, war, the, ottoman, army, at, this, time, solely, conscripted, muslims, with, non, muslims, paying, a, poll, tax, in, lieu, of, service, the, army, itself, was, divided, into, four, categories, the, nizam, standing, army, who, served, for, four, years, five, for, cavalry, and, engineers, the, ithiat, or, first, reserve, where, a, further, two, years, were, served, one, year, for, the, cavalry, and, artillery, the, redif, which, took, veterans, of, the, nizam, and, ithiat, categories, and, men, who, did, not, serve, and, the, moustafiz, where, all, men, who, had, completed, their, service, in, the, redif, approximately, 300, 000, troops, served, for, a, further, six, years, the, redif, itself, was, divided, into, four, categories, the, first, category, consisted, of, veterans, of, the, nizam, category, who, served, in, the, first, redif, subcategory, for, four, years, before, entering, the, second, redif, sub, category, men, who, were, not, conscripted, served, in, the, third, sub, category, of, the, redif, for, four, years, before, entering, the, fourth, subcategory, the, redif, itself, was, grouped, into, battalions, and, classes, with, whole, battalions, taken, out, to, serve, as, new, units, the, annual, draft, conscripted, 37, 500, men, following, mobilisation, of, the, nizam, and, ithiat, these, two, portions, of, the, army, totaled, approximately, 210, 000, men, an, additional, 20, 000, men, of, the, gendarme, were, included, in, the, nizam, the, redif, was, theoretically, capable, of, providing, 190, 000, 200, 000, troops, sultan, abdulaziz, had, reorganised, the, military, school, during, his, reign, to, educate, officers, however, the, turnout, of, this, academy, was, poor, and, only, 1, 600, of, the, 20, 000, regular, officers, of, the, army, were, academy, trained, though, the, artillery, saw, the, highest, concentration, of, academy, trained, officers, at, 20, of, the, total, for, the, entire, ottoman, army, only, 132, academy, trained, generals, were, available, the, ottoman, army, was, organised, at, the, battalion, level, with, a, battalion, nominally, holding, 800, men, subdivided, into, companies, of, 100, men, for, formations, above, the, battalion, level, these, were, to, be, assembled, ad, hoc, this, results, in, difficulty, at, estimating, ottoman, troop, strength, throughout, the, war, as, many, units, were, below, strength, before, entering, the, war, due, to, the, many, rebellions, affecting, the, empire, however, the, ottoman, army, was, well, prepared, for, war, as, it, had, increasingly, called, up, its, reserves, up, to, the, third, subcategory, of, the, redif, when, russian, forces, began, gathering, in, bessarabia, olender, gives, the, ottoman, battalion, tabor, of, infantry, at, 774, men, on,

was, also, well, equipped, 75, of, its, troops, were, equipped, with, peabody, martini, rifles, accurate, to, 1, 800, yards, with, 300, 000, of, these, guns, having, been, purchased, prior, to, the, war, the, remainder, of, the, regular, troops, used, snider, rifles, the, irregulars, used, winchester, repeating, rifles, and, the, egyptians, used, remington, rifles, the, ottoman, support, services, were, however, less, impressive, with, the, army, often, forced, to, resort, to, foraging, on, the, other, hand, ottoman, forces, were, equipped, with, entrenching, tools, which, they, used, extensively, at, plevna, and, had, sufficient, ammunition, for, their, repeating, rifles, the, ottoman, artillery, were, armed, with, krupp, guns, of, the, 8cm, and, 9cm, types, for, field, usage, with, 12, cm, and, 15cm, guns, also, being, used, but, less, commonly, and, various, older, guns, found, primarily, in, fortresses, at, the, outbreak, of, war, the, ottoman, army, was, divided, into, several, groups, the, largest, was, the, 168, 000, man, contingent, under, the, command, of, abd, lkerim, nadir, pasha, based, out, of, shumla, 140, 000, were, assigned, to, the, general, task, of,

total, of, number, of, troops, amounted, to, 378, 000, olender, gives, a, breakdown, of, ottoman, troops, in, the, spring, of, 1877, as, containing, 571, infantry, battalions, 181, of, which, were, nizam, 147, cavalry, squadrons, and, 143, artillery, batteries, not, including, the, fortress, and, garrison, companies, or, irregulars, on, paper, this, would, amount, to, 441, 954, infantry, 140, 094, being, nizam, troops, 21, 021, cavalry, and, 858, guns, however, due, to, other, conflicts, and, the, ongoing, process, of, mobilisation, of, the, redif, units, at, this, process, the, regular,

spearheaded, by, the, minister, of, war, dmitry, milyutin, this, programme, of, reform, gave, russia, a, large, army, that, was, capable, of, fighting, a, war, against, the, ottomans, all, russian, men, were, to, serve, 6, years, in, the, active, army, and, 9, years, in, the, reserves, though, through, exemption, the, effective, intake, of, conscription, was, considerably, less, in, 1874, of, 724, 648, eligible, men, only, 150, 000, were, enlisted, this, having, risen, to, 218, 000, by, 1877, in, peacetime, though, this, was, still, sufficient, to, meet, the, russian, need, for, manpower, the, active, portion, of, the, army, was, subdivided, into, 2, portions, the, local, troops, who, were, garrison, soldiers, in, europe, regular, soldiers, in, asia, stationary, forces, and, gendarmes, the, other, portion, was, the, field, army, in, addition, to, these, forces, there, was, the, militia, opolcheniye, which, contained, all, men, exempted, from, conscripted, and, men, under, 40, who, had, completed, their, terms, of, service, the, field, army, was, organised, into, 48, infantry, divisions, 3, of, which, were, guard, and, 4, grenadier, there, were, also, 8, rifle, brigades, 19,

contained, 754, 265, men, and, by, 1, january, 1878, this, had, risen, to, over, 1, 5, million, men, the, russian, army, used, 2, rifles, the, krnka, rifle, which, they, possessed, 800, 000, of, at, the, minimum, and, was, accurate, to, only, 600, yards, to, the, turkish, peabody, s, 1, 800, and, the, berdan, rifle, which, equipped, the, line, grenadier, rifle, and, guard, formations, and, was, accurate, to, 1, 500, yards, however, the, russian, army, despite, possessing, breechloading, rifles, was, still, holding, to, the, maxims, of, suvorov, which, called, for, the, usage, of, the, bayonet, as, the, principal, weapon, russian, soldiers, also, lacked, entrenching, equipment, to, an, adequate, level, russian, artillery, despite, being, breechloaded, were, nearing, obsolescence, on, 12, april, 1877, romania, gave, permission, to, the, russian, troops, to, pass, through, its, territory, to, attack, the, turks, on, 24, april, 1877, russia, declared, war, on, the, ottomans, and, its, troops, entered, romania, through, the, newly, built, eiffel, bridge, near, ungheni, on, the, prut, river, resulting, in, turkish, bombardments, of, romanian, towns, on, the, danube, on, 10, may, 1877, the, principality, of, romania, which, was, under, nominal, turkish, suzerainty, declared, its, independence, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, the, outcome, was, far, from, obvious, the, russians, could, send, a, larger, army, into, the, balkans, about, 300, 000, troops, were, within, reach, the, ottomans, had, about, 200, 000, troops, on, the, balkan, peninsula, of, which, about, 100, 000, were, assigned, to, fortified, garrisons, leaving, about, 100, 000, for, the, army, of, operation, the, ottomans, had, the, advantage, of, being, fortified, complete, command, of, the, black, sea, and, patrol, boats, along, the, danube, river, they, also, possessed, superior, arms, including, new, british, and, american, made, rifles, and, german, made, artillery, in, the, event, however, the, ottomans, usually, resorted, to, passive, defense, leaving, the, strategic, initiative, to, the, russians, who, after, making, some, mistakes, found, a, winning, strategy, for, the, war, the, ottoman, military, command, in, constantinople, made, poor, assumptions, about, russian, intentions, they, decided, that, russians, would, be, too, lazy, to, march, along, the, danube, and, cross, it, away, from, the, delta, and, would, prefer, the, short, way, along, the, black, sea, coast, this, would, be, ignoring, the, fact, that, the, coast, had, the, strongest, best, supplied, and, garrisoned, turkish, fortresses, there, was, only, one, well, manned, fortress, along, the, inner, part, of, the, river, danube, vidin, it, was, garrisoned, only, because, the, troops, led, by, osman, nuri, pasha, had, just, taken, part, in, defeating, the, serbs, in, their, recent, war, against, the, ottoman, empire, the, russian, campaign, was, better, planned, but, it, relied, heavily, on, turkish, passivity, a, crucial, russian, mistake, was, sending, too, few, troops, initially, an, expeditionary, force, of, about, 185, 000, crossed, the, danube, in, june, slightly, fewer, than, the, combined, turkish, forces, in, the, balkans, about, 200, 000, after, setbacks, in, july, at, pleven, and, stara, zagora, the, russian, military, command, realized, it, did, not, have, the, reserves, to, keep, the, offensive, going, and, switched, to, a, defensive, posture, the, russians, did, not, even, have, enough, forces, to, blockade, pleven, properly, until, late, august, which, effectively, delayed, the, whole, campaign, for, about, two, months, at, the, start, of, the, war, russia, and, romania, destroyed, all, vessels, along, the, danube, and, mined, the, river, thus, ensuring, that, russian, forces, could, cross, the, danube, at, any, point, without, resistance, from, the, ottoman, navy, the, ottoman, command, did, not, appreciate, the, significance, of, the, russians, actions, in, june, a, small, russian, unit, crossed, the, danube, close, to, the, delta, at, gala, i, and, marched, towards, ruschuk, today, ruse, this, made, the, ottomans, even, more, confident, that, the, big, russian, force, would, come, right, through, the, middle, of, the, ottoman, stronghold, in, the, first, month, of, the, war, the, ottomans, suffered, a, pair, of, significant, naval, losses, on, the, danube, the, turret, ship, l, tf, celil, was, destroyed, by, a, russian, artillery, battery, on, 11, may, and, on, the, night, of, 25, 26, may, a, romanian, torpedo, boat, with, a, mixed, romanian, russian, crew, attacked, and, sank, the, ottoman, monitor, seyf, on, the, danube, under, the, direct, command, of, major, general, mikhail, ivanovich, dragomirov, on, the, night, of, 27, 28, june, 1877, ns, the, russians, constructed, a, pontoon, bridge, across, the, danube, at, svishtov, after, a, short, battle, in, which, the, russians, suffered, 812, killed, and, wounded, the, russians, secured, the, opposing, bank, and, drove, off, the, ottoman, infantry, brigade, defending, svishtov, at, this, point, the, russian, force, was, divided, into, three, parts, the, eastern, detachment, under, the, command, of, tsarevich, alexander, alexandrovich, the, future, tsar, alexander, iii, of, russia, assigned, to, capture, the, fortress, of, ruschuk, and, cover, the, army, s, eastern, flank, the, western, detachment, to, capture, the, fortress, of, nikopol, bulgaria, and, cover, the, army, s, western, flank, and, the, advance, detachment, under, count, joseph, vladimirovich, gourko, which, was, assigned, to, quickly, move, via, veliko, tarnovo, and, penetrate, the, balkan, mountains, the, most, significant, barrier, between, the, danube, and, constantinople, responding, to, the, russian, crossing, of, the, danube, the, ottoman, high, command, in, constantinople, ordered, osman, nuri, pasha, to, advance, east, from, vidin, and, occupy, the, fortress, of, nikopol, just, west, of, the, russian, crossing, on, his, way, to, nikopol, osman, pasha, learned, that, the, russians, had, already, captured, the, fortress, and, so, moved, to, the, crossroads, town, of, plevna, now, known, as, pleven, which, he, occupied, with, a, force, of, approximately, 15, 000, on, 19, july, ns, the, russians, approximately, 9, 000, under, the, command, of, general, schilder, schuldner, reached, plevna, early, in, the, morning, thus, began, the, siege, of, plevna, lasting, for, 145, days, until, 10, december, osman, pasha, organized, a, defense, and, repelled, two, russian, attacks, with, colossal, casualties, on, the, russian, side, at, that, point, the, sides, were, almost, equal, in, numbers, and, the, russian, army, was, very, discouraged, a, counter, attack, might, have, allowed, the, ottomans, to, control, and, destroy, the, russians, bridge, but, osman, pasha, did, not, leave, the, fortress, because, he, had, orders, to, stay, fortified, in, plevna, russia, had, no, more, troops, to, throw, against, plevna, so, the, russians, besieged, it, and, subsequently, asked, the, romanians, to, cross, the, danube, and, help, them, on, 9, august, suleiman, pasha, made, an, attempt, to, help, osman, pasha, with, 30, 000, troops, but, he, was, stopped, by, bulgarians, at, the, battle, of, shipka, pass, after, three, days, of, fighting, the, volunteers, were, relieved, by, a, russian, force, led, by, general, fyodor, radetsky, and, the, turkish, forces, withdrew, soon, afterwards, romanian, forces, crossed, the, danube, and, joined, the, siege, on, 16, august, at, gorni, studen, the, armies, around, plevna, were, placed, under, the, command, of, the, romanian, prince, carol, i, aided, by, the, russian, general, pavel, dmitrievich, zotov, and, the, romanian, general, alexandru, cernat, the, turks, maintained, several, fortresses, around, pleven, which, the, russian, and, romanian, forces, gradually, reduced, the, romanian, 4th, division, led, by, general, gheorghe, manu, took, the, grivitsa, redoubt, after, four, bloody, assaults, and, managed, to, keep, it, until, the, very, end, of, the, siege, the, siege, of, plevna, july, december, 1877, turned, to, victory, only, after, russian, and, romanian, forces, cut, off, all, supply, routes, to, the, fortified, ottomans, with, supplies, running, low, osman, pasha, made, an, attempt, to, break, the, russian, siege, in, the, direction, of, opanets, on, 9, december, in, the, middle, of, the, night, the, ottomans, threw, bridges, over, the, vit, river, and, crossed, it, attacked, on, a, 2, mile, 3, 2, km, front, and, broke, through, the, first, line, of, russian, trenches, here, they, fought, hand, to, hand, and, bayonet, to, bayonet, with, little, advantage, to, either, side, outnumbering, the, ottomans, almost, 5, to, 1, the, russians, drove, the, ottomans, back, across, the, vit, osman, pasha, was, wounded, in, the, leg, by, a, stray, bullet, which, killed, his, horse, beneath, him, making, a, brief, stand, the, ottomans, eventually, found, themselves, driven, back, into, the, city, losing, 5, 000, men, to, the, russians, 2, 000, the, next, day, osman, surrendered, the, city, the, garrison, and, his, sword, to, the, romanian, colonel, mihail, cerchez, he, was, treated, honorably, but, his, troops, perished, in, the, snow, by, the, thousands, as, they, straggled, off, into, captivity, at, this, point, serbia, having, finally, secured, monetary, aid, from, russia, declared, war, on, the, ottoman, empire, again, this, time, there, were, far, fewer, russian, officers, in, the, serbian, army, but, this, was, more, than, offset, by, the, experience, gained, from, the, 1876, 77, war, under, nominal, command, of, prince, milan, obrenovi, effective, command, was, in, hands, of, general, kosta, proti, the, army, chief, of, staff, the, serbian, army, went, on, offensive, in, what, is, now, eastern, south, serbia, a, planned, offensive, into, the, ottoman, sanjak, of, novi, pazar, was, called, off, due, to, strong, diplomatic, pressure, from, austria, hungary, which, wanted, to, prevent, serbia, and, montenegro, from, coming, into, contact, and, which, had, designs, to, spread, austria, hungary, s, influence, through, the, area, the, ottomans, outnumbered, unlike, two, years, before, mostly, confined, themselves, to, passive, defence, of, fortified, positions, by, the, end, of, hostilities, the, serbs, had, captured, ak, palanka, today, bela, palanka, pirot, ni, and, vranje, russians, under, field, marshal, gourko, succeeded, in, capturing, the, passes, at, the, stara, planina, mountain, which, were, crucial, for, maneuvering, next, both, sides, fought, a, series, of, battles, for, shipka, pass, gourko, made, several, attacks, on, the, pass, and, eventually, secured, it, ottoman, troops, spent, much, effort, to, recapture, this, important, route, to, use, it, to, reinforce, osman, pasha, in, pleven, but, failed, eventually, gourko, led, a, final, offensive, that, crushed, the, ottomans, around, shipka, pass, the, ottoman, offensive, against, shipka, pass, is, considered, one, of, the, major, mistakes, of, the, war, as, other, passes, were, virtually, unguarded, at, this, time, a, huge, number, of, ottoman, troops, stayed, fortified, along, the, black, sea, coast, and, engaged, in, very, few, operations, a, russian, army, crossed, the, stara, planina, by, a, high, snowy, pass, in, winter, guided, and, helped, by, local, bulgarians, not, expected, by, the, ottoman, army, and, defeated, the, turks, at, the, battle, of, tashkessen, and, took, sofia, the, way, was, now, open, for, a, quick, advance, through, plovdiv, and, adrianople, to, constantinople, besides, the, romanian, army, which, mobilized, 130, 000, men, losing, 10, 000, of, them, to, this, war, more, than, 12, 000, volunteer, bulgarian, troops, opalchenie, from, the, local, bulgarian, population, as, well, as, many, hajduk, detachments, fought, in, the, war, on, the, side, of, the, russians, the, russian, 1st, caucasus, army, corps, was, stationed, in, georgia, and, armenia, composed, of, approximately, 50, 000, men, and, 202, guns, under, the, overall, command, of, grand, duke, michael, nikolaevich, governor, general, of, the, caucasus, the, russian, force, stood, opposed, by, an, ottoman, army, of, 100, 000, men, led, by, general, ahmed, muhtar, pasha, while, the, russian, army, was, better, prepared, for, the, fighting, in, the, region, it, lagged, behind, technologically, in, certain, areas, such, as, heavy, artillery, and, was, outgunned, for, example, by, the, superior, long, range, krupp, artillery, that, germany, had, supplied, to, the, ottomans, the, caucasus, corps, was, led, by, a, quartet, of, armenian, commanders, generals, mikhail, loris, melikov, arshak, ter, gukasov, ter, ghukasov, ter, ghukasyan, ivan, lazarev, and, beybut, shelkovnikov, forces, under, lieutenant, general, ter, gukasov, stationed, near, yerevan, commenced, the, first, assault, into, ottoman, territory, by, capturing, the, town, of, bayazid, on, 27, april, 1877, capitalizing, on, ter, gukasov, s, victory, there, russian, forces, advanced, taking, the, region, of, ardahan, on, 17, may, russian, units, also, besieged, the, city, of, kars, in, the, final, week, of, may, although, ottoman, reinforcements, lifted, the, siege, and, drove, them, back, bolstered, by, reinforcements, in, november, 1877, general, lazarev, launched, a, new, attack, on, kars, suppressing, the, southern, forts, leading, to, the, city, and, capturing, kars, itself, on, 18, november, on, 19, february, 1878, the, strategic, fortress, town, of, erzurum, was, taken, by, the, russians, after, a, lengthy, siege, although, they, relinquished, control, of, erzurum, to, the, ottomans, at, the, end, the, war, the, russians, acquired, the, regions, of, batum, ardahan, kars, olti, and, sarikamish, and, reconstituted, them, into, the, kars, oblast, during, the, course, of, the, war, the, majority, of, greeks, wanted, to, enter, the, war, on, russia, s, side, however, the, greek, government, decided, reluctantly, to, not, intervene, due, to, british, neutrality, the, british, guaranteed, that, after, the, end, of, the, war, they, would, intervene, themselves, and, assure, equal, rights, for, the, greek, subjects, of, the, ottoman, empire, as, long, as, greece, didn, t, join, the, war, nevertheless, several, greek, revolts, broke, out, in, crete, epirus, macedonia, and, thessaly, demanding, union, with, greece, the, greek, army, invaded, thessaly, in, january, 1878, but, didn, t, officially, declare, war, on, the, ottomans, along, with, greek, irregular, revolutionaries, the, greek, army, won, the, battle, of, mouzaki, however, the, great, powers, asked, for, the, greece, to, recall, its, army, in, return, they, ensured, that, issues, regarding, the, greek, communities, would, be, raised, in, the, post, war, peace, conference, the, greek, government, accepted, and, as, a, result, the, rebellions, were, left, unsupported, and, were, crushed, by, the, ottomans, three, years, later, with, the, convention, of, constantinople, most, of, thessaly, excluding, elassona, as, well, as, arta, were, ceded, to, greece, as, the, russo, turkish, war, came, to, a, close, a, kurdish, uprising, began, it, was, led, by, two, brothers, husein, and, osman, pasha, the, rebellion, held, most, of, the, region, of, bohtan, for, 9, months, it, was, ended, only, through, duplicity, after, force, of, arms, had, failed, in, kars, kurdish, notables, like, abd, rrezzak, bedir, khan, and, a, son, of, sheikh, ubeydullah, were, supporters, of, the, russians, after, bulgarian, territories, were, liberated, by, the, russian, army, during, the, war, they, were, governed, initially, by, a, provisional, russian, administration, which, was, established, in, april, 1877, the, treaty, of, berlin, 1878, provided, for, the, termination, of, this, provisional, russian, administration, in, may, 1879, when, the, principality, of, bulgaria, and, eastern, rumelia, were, established, the, main, objectives, of, the, temporary, russian, administration, were, to, secure, peace, and, order, and, to, prepare, for, a, revival, of, the, bulgarian, state, under, pressure, from, the, british, russia, accepted, the, truce, offered, by, the, ottoman, empire, on, 31, january, 1878, but, continued, to, move, towards, constantinople, the, british, sent, a, fleet, of, battleships, to, intimidate, russia, from, entering, the, city, and, russian, forces, stopped, at, san, stefano, eventually, russia, entered, into, a, settlement, under, the, treaty, of, san, stefano, on, 3, march, by, which, the, ottoman, empire, would, recognize, the, independence, of, romania, serbia, and, montenegro, and, the, autonomy, of, bulgaria, alarmed, by, the, extension, of, russian, power, into, the, balkans, the, great, powers, later, forced, modifications, of, the, treaty, in, the, congress, of, berlin, the, main, change, here, was, that, bulgaria, would, be, split, according, to, earlier, agreements, among, the, great, powers, that, precluded, the, creation, of, a, large, new, slavic, state, the, northern, and, eastern, parts, to, become, principalities, as, before, bulgaria, and, eastern, rumelia, though, with, different, governors, and, the, macedonian, region, originally, part, of, bulgaria, under, san, stefano, would, return, to, direct, ottoman, administration, the, 1879, treaty, of, constantinople, was, a, further, continuation, of, negotiations, between, russia, and, the, ottoman, empire, while, reaffirming, provisions, of, the, treaty, of, san, stefano, which, had, not, been, modified, by, the, berlin, treaty, it, set, compensation, terms, owed, by, ottoman, empire, to, russia, for, losses, sustained, during, the, war, it, contained, terms, to, release, prisoners, of, war, and, to, grant, amnesty, to, ottoman, subjects, as, well, as, providing, terms, for, the, inhabitants, nationality, after, the, annexations, article, vii, allowed, subjects, to, opt, within, six, months, of, the, signing, of, the, treaty, to, retain, ottoman, subjecthood, or, become, russian, subjects, a, surprising, consequence, came, in, hungary, part, of, the, austro, hungarian, empire, despite, memories, of, the, terrible, defeat, at, moh, cs, in, 1526, elite, hungarian, attitudes, were, becoming, strongly, anti, russian, this, led, to, active, support, for, the, turks, in, the, media, but, only, in, a, peaceful, way, since, the, foreign, policy, of, the, austro, hungarian, monarchy, remained, neutral, the, bulletins, de, l, alliance, isra, lite, universelle, reported, that, thousands, of, bulgarian, jews, found, refuge, at, constantinople, and, reported, that, many, jewish, communities, had, fled, in, their, entirety, with, the, retreating, turks, as, their, protectors, however, this, is, directly, contradicted, by, census, figures, which, instead, of, a, decrease, indicate, a, substantial, increase, in, bulgaria, s, jewish, population, before, and, after, the, war, while, there, were, only, 4, 595, males, or, 9, 190, male, and, female, jews, in, the, five, vilayets, to, form, the, future, principality, of, bulgaria, rus, uk, vidin, sofia, tirnova, and, varna, according, to, the, pre, war, ottoman, salname, of, 1875, 0, 4, of, the, population, the, 1880, bulgarian, census, indicated, a, total, of, 14, 342, jews, who, accounted, for, 0, 7, of, the, post, war, bulgarian, population, moreover, an, increase, by, 5, 152, people, or, 56, in, less, than, five, years, cannot, be, explained, by, natural, increase, alone, and, would, rather, indicate, substantial, net, immigration, rather, than, emigration, of, jews, from, the, principality, obviously, any, such, immigration, or, return, of, refugees, would, happen, only, after, the, postwar, situation, stabilized, offering, necessary, personal, and, economic, security, the, conclusion, of, the, russo, turkish, war, also, led, to, the, internationalization, of, the, armenian, question, many, armenians, in, the, eastern, provinces, turkish, armenia, of, the, ottoman, empire, greeted, the, advancing, russians, as, liberators, violence, and, instability, directed, at, armenians, during, the, war, by, kurd, and, circassian, bands, had, left, many, armenians, looking, toward, the, invading, russians, as, the, ultimate, guarantors, of, their, security, influential, pro, russian, armenian, thinker, grigor, artsruni, encouraged, armenians, to, migrate, to, russia, in, order, to, form, a, more, concentrated, block, in, january, 1878, armenian, patriarch, of, constantinople, nerses, ii, varzhapetian, approached, the, russian, leadership, with, the, view, of, receiving, assurances, that, the, russians, would, introduce, provisions, in, the, prospective, peace, treaty, for, self, administration, in, the, armenian, provinces, though, not, as, explicit, article, 16, of, the, treaty, of, san, stefano, read, as, the, evacuation, of, the, russian, troops, of, the, territory, they, occupy, in, armenia, and, which, is, to, be, restored, to, turkey, might, give, rise, to, conflicts, and, complications, detrimental, to, the, maintenance, of, good, relations, between, the, two, countries, the, sublime, porte, engaged, to, carry, into, effect, without, further, delay, the, improvements, and, reforms, demanded, by, local, requirements, in, the, provinces, inhabited, by, armenians, and, to, guarantee, their, security, from, kurds, and, circassians, the, armenian, patriarch, discouraged, armenian, migration, to, russia, and, encouraged, armenians, to, remain, faithful, to, the, sultan, the, patriarch, held, the, belief, that, armenian, inhabited, areas, could, remain, under, ottoman, rule, but, under, christian, control, and, that, muslims, who, were, dissatisfied, with, how, the, ottomans, had, been, governing, the, provinces, would, tolerate, life, under, christian, leadership, in, attempting, to, persuade, the, british, to, drive, a, hard, bargain, with, the, ottoman, empire, he, asserted, to, british, ambassador, austen, henry, layard, that, the, only, thing, that, could, induce, the, armenians, to, refrain, from, listening, to, the, advice, of, russia, to, emigrate, and, to, be, content, to, remain, under, the, rule, of, the, sultan, would, be, the, appointment, of, an, armenian, as, vali, of, armenia, great, britain, however, took, objection, to, russia, holding, on, to, so, much, ottoman, territory, and, forced, it, to, enter, into, new, negotiations, by, convening, the, congress, of, berlin, in, june, 1878, an, armenian, delegation, led, by, prelate, mkrtich, khrimian, traveled, to, berlin, to, present, the, case, of, the, armenians, but, much, to, its, chagrin, was, left, out, of, the, negotiations, article, 16, was, modified, and, watered, down, and, all, mention, of, the, russian, forces, remaining, in, the, provinces, was, removed, in, the,

constantinople, and, delivered, a, famous, speech, in, which, he, likened, the, peace, conference, to, a, big, cauldron, of, liberty, stew, into, which, the, big, nations, dipped, their, iron, ladles, for, real, results, while, the, armenian, delegation, had, only, a, paper, ladle, ah, dear, armenian, people, khrimian, said, could, i, have, dipped, my, paper, ladle, in, the, cauldron, it, would, sog, and, remain, there, where, guns, talk, and, sabers, shine, what, significance, do, appeals, and, petitions, have, given, the, absence, of, tangible, improvements, in, the, plight, of, the, armenian, community, a, number, of, armenian, intellectuals, living, in, europe, and, russia, in, the, 1880s, and, 1890s, formed, political, parties, and, revolutionary, societies, to, secure, better,

that, a, huge, group, of, muslim, townspeople, were, attacked, by, the, russian, army, thousands, died, and, their, goods, were, confiscated, the, correspondent, of, the, daily, news, describes, as,

romania, and, austria, hungary, from, bosnia, from, 1876, to, 1879, stands, at, 571, 152, people, 276, 389, in, 1876, 198, 000, in, 1877, 76, 000, in, 1878, and, 20, 763, in, 1879, however, it, is, unclear, if, the, numbers, include, refugees, who, emigrated, after, the, suspension, of, hostilities, according, to, the, pre, war, ottoman, salname, of, 1875, the, total, male, muslim, population, of, the, five, vilayets, to, form, the, future, principality, of, bulgaria, rus, uk, vidin, sofia, tirnova, and, varna, stood, at, 405, 450, total, population, of, 810, 900, however, inclusive, of,

muslim, population, of, the, danube, vilayet, for, the, same, year, ni, included, stood, at, 1, 055, 650, this, number, included, not, only, ottoman, turks, but, also, crimean, tatars, circassians, pomaks, romani, as, well, as, a, substantial, number, of, albanians, at, the, same, time, the, 1876, ottoman, population, records, for, the, sanjaks, of, filibe, and, slimye, which, were, detached, from, the, adrianople, vilayet, to, form, eastern, rumelia, in, 1878, indicated, 171, 777, male, turks, and, 16, 353, male, muslim, romani, or, total, muslim, population, of, 376, 260, this, figure, however, included, the, rhodopian, kazas, of, ahi, elebi, and, sultanyeri, male, muslim, population, of, 8, 197, and, 13, 336, respectively, or, total, muslim, population, for, both, of, 43, 066, which, remained, part, of, in, the, ottoman, empire, without, ahi, elebi, and, sultanyeri, the, muslim, population, of, eastern, rumelia, was, 333, 194, thus, according, to, the, ottoman, empire, s, own, population, records, the, total, number, of, muslims, in, the, territories, ceded, by, the, empire, to, the, principality, of, bulgaria, eastern, rumelia, serbia, and, romania, did, not, exceed, 1, 388, 844, people, 1, 055, 650, for, the, danube, vilayet, and, 333, 194, for, the, filibe, and, slimye, sanjaks, a, figure, that, is, lower, than, the, approx, 1, 5, million, turks, who, had, reportedly, perished, or, been, forced, to, migrate, according, to, both, karpat, and, pek, whose, estimates, would, also, necessarily, mean, that, no, muslims, whatsoever, remained, in, either, the, principality, of, bulgaria, eastern, rumelia, serbia, or, romanian, dobruja, at, the, same, time, the, 1880, population, census, of, the, principality, of, bulgaria, gave, 578, 060, muslims, the,

showed, 18, 624, turks, and, 29, 476, crimean, tatars, total, of, 48, 100, muslims, while, the, 1880, population, census, of, serbia, stated, only, 6, 567, muslims, in, the, ni, area, thus, as, of, 1880, the, total, number, of, muslims, who, lived, in, the, territories, ceded, by, the, ottoman, empire, stood, at, 827, 000, people, down, from, 1, 388, 844, muslims, counted, by, the, pre, war, ottoman, statistics, signifying, a, net, loss, of, 561, 844, muslims, 40, 4, while, shockingly, high, this, figure, falls, short, by, more, than, 200, 000, people, of, dennis, p, hupchick, and, justin, mccarthy, s, estimates, of, some, 260, 000, muslims, missing, dead, and, 500, 000, forced, to, emigrate, and, is, way, more, off, compared, to, the, figure, of, more, than, 750, 000, muslim, casualties, and, victims, of, ethnic, cleansing, from, the, bulgarian, lands, alone, quoted, by, douglas, arthur, howard, the, principality, of, bulgaria, eastern, rumelia, and, romania, accounted, for, a, negative, net, balance, of, 472, 792, muslims, or, a, net, loss, of, 36, 5, by, comparison, serbia, the, only, country, in, the, region, which, did, indeed, engage, in, ethnic, cleansing, and, forced, expulsion, of, its, muslim, population, effectively, reduced, its, muslim, population, between, 1877, and, 1880, from, 95, 619, to, 6, 567, people, cf, expulsion, of, the, albanians, 1877, 1878, i, e, a, net, loss, of, 89, 052, muslims, or, 93, 20th, century, historians, have, made, different, guesses, about, the, total, muslim, losses, during, the, russo, turkish, war, dennis, p, hupchick, and, justin, mccarthy, says, that, 260, 000, people, went, missing, and, 500, 000, became, refugees, turkish, historian, kemal, karpat, claims, that, 250, 300, 000, people, about, 17, of, the, former, muslim, population, of, bulgaria, died, as, a, consequence, of, famine, disease, and, massacres, and, 1, to, 1, 5, million, people, were, forced, to, migrate, turkish, author, nedim, pek, gives, the, same, numbers, as, karpat, another, source, claims, 400, 000, turks, were, massacred, and, 1, 000, 000, turks, had, to, migrate, during, the, war, the, perpetrators, of, those, massacres, are, also, disputed, with, justin, mccarthy, claiming, that, they, were, carried, out, by, russian, soldiers, cossacks, as, well, as, bulgarian, volunteers, and, villagers, though, there, were, few, civilian, casualties, in, battle, while, james, j, reid, claims, that, circassians, were, significantly, responsible, for, the, refugee, flow, that, there, were, civilian, casualties, from, battle, and, even, that, the, ottoman, army, was, responsible, for, casualties, among, the, muslim, population, the, number, of, muslim, refugees, is, estimated, by, r, j, crampton, to, be, 130, 000, richard, c, frucht, estimates, that, only, half, 700, 000, of, the, prewar, muslim, population, remained, after, the, war, 216, 000, had, died, and, the, rest, emigrated, douglas, arthur, howard, estimates, that, half, the, 1, 5, million, muslims, for, the, most, part, turks, in, prewar, bulgaria, had, disappeared, by, 1879, 200, 000, had, died, the, rest, became, permanently, refugees, in, ottoman, territories, in, this, connection, it, is, important, to, note, that, justin, mccarthy, who, is, the, author, of, the, estimates, above, and, has, been, requoted, by, both, hupchik, and, howard, is, an, armenian, genocide, denialist, who, has, been, criticised, severely, by, many, of, his, colleagues, for, whitewashing, ottoman, history, moreover, mccarthy, is, a, member, of, and, has, received, grants, from, the, institute, of, turkish, studies, throughout, his, career, he, has, been, accused, among, other, things, of, being, an, apologist, for, the, turkish, state, of, having, an, indefensible, bias, toward, the, turkish, official, position, of, selectively, using, sources, and, of, always, ascribing, intent, to, non, ottoman, troops, while, making, excuses, for, ottoman, ones, for, similar, events, the, most, notable, massacre, of, bulgarian, civilians, during, the, russo, turkish, war, took, place, during, the, battle, of, stara, zagora, in, july, 1877, when, gurko, s, forces, had, to, retreat, back, to, the, shipka, pass, in, the, aftermath, of, the, battle, suleiman, pasha, s, forces, burned, down, and, plundered, the, city, of, stara, zagora, and, subjected, its, population, to, indiscriminate, slaughter, at, the, time, stara, zagora, was, not, only, one, of, the, biggest, bulgarian, cities, but, it, also, accommodated, some, 20, 000, refugees, from, nearby, villages, seeking, shelter, from, ottoman, reprisals, the, number, of, massacred, christian, civilians, in, the, course, of, the, battle, is, estimated, at, between, 14, 000, and, 14, 500, which, would, make, it, the, biggest, war, crime, in, modern, era, bulgaria, in, addition, to, the, massacre, carried, out, by, the, suleiman, s, regular, forces, circassian, bashi, bazouks, engaged, in, numerous, acts, of, looting, plunder, and, killing, among, other, things, the, terror, in, karlovo, the, kalofer, massacre, the, kavarna, uprising, etc, etc, moreover, suleiman, pasha, s, forces, also, established, an, entire, system, of, police, and, judicial, terror, across, the, entire, valley, of, the, maritsa, where, any, bulgarian, who, had, ever, in, any, way, assisted, the, russians, was, hanged, however, even, villages, that, had, not, assisted, the, russians, were, destroyed, and, their, inhabitants, massacred, as, a, result, as, many, as, 100, 000, civilian, bulgarians, fled, north, to, the, russian, occupied, territories, later, on, in, the, campaign, the, ottoman, forces, planned, to, burn, the, town, of, sofia, after, gurko, had, managed, to, overcome, their, resistance, in, the, passes, of, western, part, of, the, balkan, mountains, only, the, refusal, of, the, italian, consul, vito, positano, the, french, vice, consul, leandre, le, gay, and, the, austro, hungarian, vice, consul, to, leave, sofia, prevented, that, from, happening, after, the, ottoman, retreat, positano, even, organized, armed, detachments, to, protect, the, population, from, marauders, regular, ottoman, army, deserters, and, bashi, bazouks, circassians, in, the, ottoman, forces, also, raped, and, murdered, bulgarians, during, the, 1877, russo, turkish, war, according, to, bulgarian, historians, 30, 000, bulgarian, civilians, were, killed, during, the, war, with, two, thirds, of, the, killings, being, committed, in, the, stara, zagora, area, russians, raped, circassian, girls, during, the, 1877, russo, turkish, war, from, the, circassian, refugees, who, were, settled, in, the, ottoman, balkans, after, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, san, stefano, the, 10, 000, strong, circassian, minority, in, dobruja, was, expelled, this, war, caused, a, division, in, the, emblems, of, the, international, red, cross, and, red, crescent, movement, which, continues, to, this, day, both, russia, and, the, ottoman, empire, had, signed, the, first, geneva, convention, 1864, which, made, the, red, cross, a, colour, reversal, of, the, flag, of, neutral, switzerland, the, sole, emblem, of, protection, for, military, medical, personnel, and, facilities, however, during, this, war, the, cross, instead, reminded, the, ottomans, of, the, crusades, so, they, elected, to, replace, the, cross, with, the, red, crescent, instead, this, ultimately, became, the, symbol, of, the, movement, s, national, societies, in, most, muslim, countries, and, was, ratified, as, an, emblem, of, protection, by, later, geneva, conventions, in, 1929, and, again, in, 1949, the, current, version, iran, which, neighbored, both, the, russian, empire, and, ottoman, empire, considered, them, to, be, rivals, and, probably, considered, the, red, crescent, in, particular, to, be, an, ottoman, symbol, except, for, the, red, crescent, being, centred, and, without, a, star, it, is, a, colour, reversal, of, the, ottoman, flag, and, the, modern, turkish, flag, this, appears, to, have, led, to, their, national, society, in, the, movement, being, initially, known, as, the, red, lion, and, sun, society, using, a, red, version, of, the, lion, and, sun, a, traditional, iranian, symbol, after, the, iranian, revolution, of, 1979, iran, switched, to, the, red, crescent, but, the, geneva, conventions, continue, to, recognize, the, red, lion, and, sun, as, an, emblem, of, protection, the, novella, jalaleddin, published, in, 1878, by, the, novelist, raffi, describes, the, kurdish, massacres, of,
