the, carolingian, empire, 800, 887, was, a, frankish, dominated, empire, in, western, and, central, europe, during, the, early, middle, ages, it, was, ruled, by, the, carolingian, dynasty, which, had, ruled, as, kings, of, the, franks, since, 751, and, as, kings, of, the, lombards, in, italy, from, 774, in, 800, the, frankish, king, charlemagne, was, crowned, emperor, in, rome, by, pope, leo, iii, in, an, effort, to, transfer, the, roman, empire, from, the, byzantine, empire, to, western, europe, the, carolingian, empire, is, sometimes, considered, the, first, phase, in, the, history, of, the, holy, roman, empire, after, a, civil, war, 840, 843, following, the, death, of, emperor, louis, the, pious, the, empire, was, divided, into, autonomous, kingdoms, with, one, king, still, recognised, as, emperor, but, with, little, authority, outside, his, own, kingdom, the, unity, of, the, empire, and, the, hereditary, right, of, the, carolingians, continued, to, be, acknowledged, in, 884, charles, the, fat, reunited, all, the, carolingian, kingdoms, for, the, last, time, but, he, was, deposed, by, the, frankish, nobility, in, 887, and, died, in, 888, and, the, empire, immediately, split, up, with, the, only, remaining, legitimate, male, of, the, dynasty, a, child, the, nobility, elected, regional, kings, from, outside, the, dynasty, or, in, the, case, of, the, eastern, kingdom, an, illegitimate, carolingian, the, illegitimate, line, continued, to, rule, in, the, east, until, 911, while, in, the, western, kingdom, the, legitimate, carolingian, dynasty, was, restored, in, 898, and, ruled, until, 987, with, an, interruption, from, 922, to, 936, the, population, of, the, empire, was, roughly, between, 10, and, 20, million, people, its, heartland, was, francia, the, land, between, the, loire, and, the, rhine, where, the, realm, s, primary, royal, residence, aachen, was, located, in, the, south, it, crossed, the, pyrenees, and, bordered, the, emirate, of, c, rdoba, and, after, 824, the, kingdom, of, pamplona, to, the, north, it, bordered, the, kingdom, of, the, danes, to, the, west, it, had, a, short, land, border, with, brittany, which, was, later, reduced, to, a, tributary, and, to, the, east, it, had, a, long, border, with, the, slavs, and, the, avars, who, were, eventually, defeated, and, their, land, incorporated, into, the, empire, in, southern, italy, the, carolingians, claims, to, authority, were, disputed, by, the, byzantines, and, the, vestiges, of, the, lombard, kingdom, in, the, principality, of, benevento, in, its, day, it, was, known, by, various, latin, names, the, term, carolingian, empire, arose, later, the, term, carolingian, empire, is, a, modern, convention, and, was, not, used, by, its, contemporaries, the, language, of, official, acts, in, the, empire, was, latin, the, empire, was, referred, to, variously, as, universum, regnum, the, whole, kingdom, as, opposed, to, the, regional, kingdoms, romanorum, sive, francorum, imperium, empire, of, the, romans, and, franks, romanum, imperium, roman, empire, or, even, imperium, christianum, christian, empire, though, charles, martel, chose, not, to, take, the, title, of, king, as, his, son, pepin, iii, would, or, emperor, as, his, grandson, charlemagne, he, was, the, absolute, ruler, of, virtually, all, of, today, s, continental, western, europe, north, of, the, pyrenees, only, the, remaining, saxon, realms, which, he, partly, conquered, lombardy, and, the, marca, hispanica, south, of, the, pyrenees, were, significant, additions, to, the, frankish, realms, after, his, death, martel, cemented, his, place, in, history, with, his, defense, of, christian, europe, against, a, muslim, army, at, the, battle, of, tours, in, 732, the, iberian, saracens, had, incorporated, berber, light, horse, cavalry, with, the, heavy, arab, cavalry, to, create, a, formidable, army, that, had, almost, never, been, defeated, christian, european, forces, meanwhile, lacked, the, powerful, tool, of, the, stirrup, in, this, victory, charles, earned, the, surname, martel, the, hammer, edward, gibbon, the, historian, of, rome, and, its, aftermath, called, charles, martel, the, paramount, prince, of, his, age, pepin, iii, accepted, the, nomination, as, king, by, pope, zachary, in, about, 741, charlemagne, s, rule, began, in, 768, at, pepin, s, death, he, proceeded, to, take, control, of, the, kingdom, following, his, brother, carloman, s, death, as, the, two, brothers, co, inherited, their, father, s, kingdom, charlemagne, was, crowned, roman, emperor, in, the, year, 800, the, carolingian, empire, during, the, reign, of, charlemagne, covered, most, of, western, europe, as, the, roman, empire, once, had, unlike, the, romans, whose, imperial, ventures, between, the, rhine, and, the, elbe, lasted, fewer, than, twenty, years, before, being, cut, short, by, the, disaster, at, teutoburg, forest, 9, ad, charlemagne, defeated, the, germanic, resistance, and, extended, his, realm, to, the, elbe, more, lastingly, influencing, events, almost, to, the, russian, steppes, charlemagne, s, reign, was, one, of, near, constant, warfare, participating, in, annual, campaigns, many, led, personally, he, defeated, the, lombard, kingdom, in, 774, and, annexed, it, into, his, own, domain, by, declaring, himself, king, of, the, lombards, he, later, led, a, failed, campaign, into, spain, in, 778, ending, with, the, battle, of, roncevaux, pass, which, is, considered, charlemagne, s, greatest, defeat, he, then, extended, his, domain, into, bavaria, after, forcing, tassilo, iii, duke, of, bavaria, to, renounce, any, claim, to, his, title, in, 794, his, son, pepin, was, ordered, to, campaign, against, the, avars, in, 795, since, charlemagne, was, occupied, with, saxon, revolts, eventually, the, avar, confederation, ended, in, 803, after, charlemagne, sent, a, bavarian, army, into, pannonia, he, also, conquered, saxon, territories, in, wars, and, rebellions, fought, from, 772, to, 804, with, such, events, as, the, massacre, of, verden, in, 782, and, the, codification, of, the, lex, saxonum, in, 802, prior, to, the, death, of, charlemagne, the, empire, was, divided, among, various, members, of, the, carolingian, dynasty, these, included, king, charles, the, younger, son, of, charlemagne, who, received, neustria, king, louis, the, pious, who, received, aquitaine, and, king, pepin, who, received, italy, pepin, died, with, an, illegitimate, son, bernard, in, 810, and, charles, died, without, heirs, in, 811, although, bernard, succeeded, pepin, as, king, of, italy, louis, was, made, co, emperor, in, 813, and, the, entire, empire, passed, to, him, with, charlemagne, s, death, in, the, winter, of, 814, louis, the, pious, reign, as, emperor, was, unexpected, as, the, third, son, of, charlemagne, he, was, originally, crowned, king, of, aquitaine, at, three, years, old, with, the, deaths, of, his, older, siblings, he, went, from, a, boy, who, became, a, king, to, a, man, who, would, be, emperor, although, his, reign, was, mostly, overshadowed, by, the, dynastic, struggle, and, resultant, civil, war, as, his, epithet, states, he, was, highly, interested, in, matters, of, religion, one, of, the, first, things, he, did, was, ruling, the, people, by, law, and, with, the, wealth, of, his, piety, namely, by, restoring, churches, the, astronomer, stated, that, during, his, kingship, of, aquitaine, he, built, up, the, study, of, reading, and, singing, and, also, the, understanding, of, divine, and, worldly, letters, more, quickly, than, one, would, believe, he, also, made, significant, effort, to, restore, many, monasteries, that, had, disappeared, prior, to, his, reign, as, well, as, sponsoring, new, ones, louis, the, pious, reign, lacked, security, he, often, had, to, struggle, to, maintain, control, of, the, empire, as, soon, as, he, heard, of, the, death, of, charlemagne, he, hurried, to, aachen, where, he, exiled, many, of, charlemagne, s, trusted, advisors, such, as, wala, wala, and, his, siblings, were, children, of, the, youngest, son, of, charles, martel, and, so, were, a, threat, as, a, potential, alternative, ruling, family, monastic, exile, was, a, tactic, louis, used, heavily, in, his, early, reign, to, strengthen, his, position, and, remove, potential, rivals, in, 817, his, nephew, king, bernard, of, italy, rebelled, against, him, due, to, discontent, with, being, the, vassal, of, lothar, louis, eldest, son, the, rebellion, was, quickly, put, down, by, louis, and, by, 818, bernard, of, italy, was, captured, and, punished, the, punishment, of, death, was, commuted, to, blinding, however, the, trauma, of, the, procedure, ending, up, killing, him, two, days, later, italy, was, brought, back, into, imperial, control, in, 822, louis, show, of, penance, for, bernard, s, death, greatly, reduced, his, prestige, as, emperor, to, the, nobility, some, suggest, it, opened, him, up, to, clerical, domination, nonetheless, in, 817, louis, had, established, three, new, carolingian, kingships, for, his, sons, from, his, first, marriage, lothar, was, made, king, of, italy, and, co, emperor, pepin, was, made, king, of, aquitaine, and, louis, the, german, was, made, king, of, bavaria, his, attempts, in, 823, to, bring, his, fourth, son, from, his, second, marriage, charles, the, bald, into, the, will, was, marked, by, the, resistance, of, his, eldest, sons, whilst, this, was, part, of, the, reason, for, strife, amongst, louis, sons, some, suggest, that, it, was, the, appointment, of, bernard, of, septimania, as, chamberlain, which, caused, discontent, with, lothar, as, he, was, stripped, of, his, co, emperorship, in, 829, and, was, banished, to, italy, although, it, is, not, known, why, the, astronomer, simply, states, that, louis, dismissed, his, son, lothar, to, go, back, to, italy, and, bernard, assumed, his, place, as, second, in, command, to, the, emperor, with, bernard, s, influence, over, not, only, the, emperor, but, the, empress, as, well, further, discord, was, sowed, amongst, prominent, nobility, pepin, louis, second, son, too, was, disgruntled, he, had, been, implicated, in, a, failed, military, campaign, in, 827, and, he, was, tired, of, his, father, s, overbearing, involvement, in, the, ruling, of, aquitaine, as, such, the, angry, nobility, supported, pepin, civil, war, broke, out, during, lent, in, 830, and, the, last, years, of, his, reign, were, plagued, by, civil, war, shortly, after, easter, his, sons, attacked, louis, empire, and, dethroned, him, in, favour, of, lothar, the, astronomer, stated, louis, spent, the, summer, in, the, custody, of, his, son, an, emperor, in, name, only, the, following, year, louis, attacked, his, sons, kingdoms, by, drafting, new, plans, for, succession, louis, gave, neustria, to, pepin, stripped, lothar, of, his, imperial, title, and, granted, the, kingdom, of, italy, to, charles, another, partition, in, 832, completely, excluded, pepin, and, louis, the, german, making, lothar, and, charles, the, sole, benefactors, of, the, kingdom, which, precipitated, pepin, and, louis, the, german, revolting, in, the, same, year, followed, by, lothar, in, 833, and, together, they, imprisoned, louis, the, pious, and, charles, lothar, brought, pope, gregory, iv, from, rome, under, the, guise, of, mediation, but, his, true, role, was, to, legitimise, lothar, and, his, brothers, rule, by, deposing, and, excommunicating, louis, by, 835, peace, was, made, within, the, family, and, louis, was, restored, to, the, imperial, throne, at, the, church, of, st, stephen, in, metz, when, pepin, died, in, 838, louis, crowned, charles, king, of, aquitaine, whilst, the, nobility, elected, pepin, s, son, pepin, ii, a, conflict, which, was, not, resolved, until, 860, with, pepin, s, death, when, louis, the, pious, finally, died, in, 840, lothar, claimed, the, entire, empire, irrespective, of, the, partitions, as, a, result, charles, and, louis, the, german, went, to, war, against, lothar, after, losing, the, battle, of, fontenay, lothar, fled, to, his, capital, at, aachen, and, raised, a, new, army, which, was, inferior, to, that, of, the, younger, brothers, in, the, oaths, of, strasbourg, in, 842, charles, and, louis, agreed, to, declare, lothar, unfit, for, the, imperial, throne, this, marked, the, east, west, division, of, the, empire, between, louis, and, charles, until, the, verdun, treaty, considered, a, milestone, in, european, history, the, oaths, of, strasbourg, symbolize, the, birth, of, both, france, and, germany, the, partition, of, carolingian, empire, was, finally, settled, in, 843, by, and, between, louis, the, pious, three, sons, in, the, treaty, of, verdun, lothar, received, the, imperial, title, the, kingship, of, italy, and, the, territory, between, the, rhine, and, rhone, rivers, collectively, called, the, central, frankish, realm, louis, was, guaranteed, the, kingship, of, all, lands, to, the, east, of, the, rhine, and, to, the, north, and, east, of, italy, which, was, called, the, eastern, frankish, realm, which, was, the, precursor, to, modern, germany, charles, received, all, lands, west, of, the, rhone, which, was, called, the, western, frankish, realm, lothar, retired, italy, to, his, eldest, son, louis, ii, in, 844, making, him, co, emperor, in, 850, lothar, died, in, 855, dividing, his, kingdom, into, three, parts, the, territory, already, held, by, louis, remained, his, the, territory, of, the, former, kingdom, of, burgundy, was, granted, to, his, third, son, charles, of, burgundy, and, the, remaining, territory, for, which, there, was, no, traditional, name, was, granted, to, his, second, son, lothar, ii, whose, realm, was, named, lotharingia, louis, ii, dissatisfied, with, having, received, no, additional, territory, upon, his, father, s, death, allied, with, his, uncle, louis, the, german, against, his, brother, lothar, and, his, uncle, charles, the, bald, in, 858, lothar, reconciled, with, his, brother, and, uncle, shortly, after, charles, was, so, unpopular, that, he, could, not, raise, an, army, to, fight, the, invasion, and, instead, fled, to, burgundy, he, was, only, saved, when, the, bishops, refused, to, crown, louis, the, german, king, in, 860, charles, the, bald, invaded, charles, of, burgundy, s, kingdom, but, was, repulsed, lothar, ii, ceded, lands, to, louis, ii, in, 862, for, support, of, a, divorce, from, his, wife, which, caused, repeated, conflicts, with, the, pope, and, his, uncles, charles, of, burgundy, died, in, 863, and, his, kingdom, was, inherited, by, louis, ii, lothar, ii, died, in, 869, with, no, legitimate, heirs, and, his, kingdom, was, divided, between, charles, the, bald, and, louis, the, german, in, 870, by, the, treaty, of, meerssen, meanwhile, louis, the, german, was, involved, in, disputes, with, his, three, sons, louis, ii, died, in, 875, and, named, carloman, the, eldest, son, of, louis, the, german, his, heir, charles, the, bald, supported, by, the, pope, was, crowned, both, king, of, italy, and, emperor, the, following, year, louis, the, german, died, charles, tried, to, annex, his, realm, too, but, was, defeated, decisively, at, andernach, and, the, kingdom, of, the, eastern, franks, was, divided, between, louis, the, younger, carloman, of, bavaria, and, charles, the, fat, the, empire, after, the, death, of, charles, the, bald, was, under, attack, in, the, north, and, west, by, the, vikings, and, was, facing, internal, struggles, from, italy, to, the, baltic, from, hungary, in, the, east, to, aquitaine, in, the, west, charles, the, bald, died, in, 877, crossing, the, pass, of, mont, cenis, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, louis, the, stammerer, as, king, of, the, western, franks, but, the, title, of, emperor, lapsed, louis, the, stammerer, was, physically, weak, and, died, two, years, later, his, realm, being, divided, between, his, eldest, two, sons, louis, iii, gaining, neustria, and, francia, and, carloman, gaining, aquitaine, and, burgundy, the, kingdom, of, italy, was, finally, granted, to, king, carloman, of, bavaria, but, a, stroke, forced, him, to, abdicate, italy, to, his, brother, charles, the, fat, and, bavaria, to, louis, of, saxony, also, in, 879, boso, of, vienne, founded, the, kingdom, of, lower, burgundy, in, provence, in, 881, charles, the, fat, was, crowned, emperor, while, louis, iii, of, saxony, and, louis, iii, of, francia, died, the, following, year, saxony, and, bavaria, were, united, with, charles, the, fat, s, kingdom, and, francia, and, neustria, were, granted, to, carloman, of, aquitaine, who, also, conquered, lower, burgundy, carloman, died, in, a, hunting, accident, in, 884, after, a, tumultuous, and, ineffective, reign, and, his, lands, were, inherited, by, charles, the, fat, effectively, recreating, the, empire, of, charlemagne, charles, suffering, what, is, believed, to, be, epilepsy, could, not, secure, the, kingdom, against, viking, raiders, and, after, buying, their, withdrawal, from, paris, in, 886, was, perceived, by, the, court, as, being, cowardly, and, incompetent, the, following, year, his, nephew, arnulf, of, carinthia, the, illegitimate, son, of, king, carloman, of, bavaria, raised, the, standard, of, rebellion, instead, of, fighting, the, insurrection, charles, fled, to, neidingen, and, died, the, following, year, in, 888, leaving, a, divided, entity, and, a, disorderly, succession, the, empire, of, the, carolingians, was, divided, arnulf, maintained, carinthia, bavaria, lorraine, and, modern, germany, count, odo, of, paris, was, elected, king, of, western, francia, france, ranulf, ii, became, king, of, aquitaine, italy, went, to, count, berengar, of, friuli, upper, burgundy, to, rudolph, i, and, lower, burgundy, to, louis, the, blind, the, son, of, boso, of, arles, king, of, lower, burgundy, and, maternal, grandson, of, emperor, louis, ii, the, other, part, of, lotharingia, became, the, duchy, of, burgundy, the, study, of, demographics, in, the, early, middle, ages, is, a, notably, difficult, task, in, his, comprehensive, framing, the, early, middle, ages, chris, wickham, suggests, that, there, are, currently, no, reliable, calculations, for, the, period, regarding, the, populations, of, early, medieval, towns, what, is, likely, however, is, that, most, cities, of, the, empire, did, not, exceed, the, 20, 25, 000, speculated, for, rome, during, this, period, on, an, empire, wide, level, populations, expanded, steadily, from, 750, to, 850, ad, figures, ranging, from, 10, to, 20, million, have, been, offered, with, estimates, being, devised, based, on, calculations, of, empire, size, and, theoretical, densities, recently, however, timothy, newfield, challenges, the, idea, of, demographic, expansion, criticising, scholars, for, relying, on, the, impact, of, recurring, pandemics, in, the, preceding, period, of, 541, 750, ad, and, ignoring, the, frequency, of, famines, in, carolingian, europe, a, study, using, climate, proxies, such, as, the, greenland, ice, core, sample, gisp2, has, indicated, that, there, may, have, been, relatively, favourable, conditions, for, the, empire, s, early, years, although, several, harsh, winters, appear, afterwards, whilst, demographic, implications, are, observable, in, contemporary, sources, the, extent, of, the, impact, of, these, findings, on, the, empire, s, populations, is, difficult, to, discern, studies, of, ethnicity, in, the, carolingian, empire, have, been, largely, limited, however, it, is, accepted, that, the, empire, was, inhabited, by, major, ethnic, groups, such, as, franks, alemanni, bavarians, thuringians, frisians, lombards, goths, romans, celts, basques, and, slavs, ethnicity, was, just, one, of, many, systems, of, identification, in, this, period, and, was, a, way, to, show, social, status, and, political, agency, many, regional, and, ethnic, identities, were, maintained, and, would, later, become, significant, in, a, political, role, regarding, laws, ethnic, identity, helped, decide, which, codes, applied, to, which, populations, however, these, systems, were, not, definitive, representations, of, ethnicity, as, these, systems, were, somewhat, fluid, evidence, from, carolingian, estate, surveys, and, polyptychs, appears, to, suggest, that, female, life, expectancy, was, lower, than, that, of, men, in, this, period, with, analyses, recording, high, ratios, of, males, to, females, however, it, is, possible, this, is, due, to, a, recording, bias, the, government, administration, and, organization, of, the, carolingian, empire, were, forged, in, the, court, of, charlemagne, in, the, decades, around, the, year, 800, in, this, year, charlemagne, was, crowned, emperor, and, adapted, his, existing, royal, administration, to, live, up, to, the, expectations, of, his, new, title, the, political, reforms, wrought, in, aachen, were, to, have, an, immense, impact, on, the, political, definition, of, western, europe, for, the, rest, of, the, middle, ages, the, carolingian, improvements, on, the, old, merovingian, mechanisms, of, governance, have, been, lauded, by, historians, for, the, increased, central, control, efficient, bureaucracy, accountability, and, cultural, renaissance, the, carolingian, empire, was, the, largest, western, territory, since, the, fall, of, rome, but, historians, have, come, to, suspect, the, depth, of, the, emperor, s, influence, and, control, legally, the, carolingian, emperor, exercised, the, bannum, the, right, to, rule, and, command, over, all, of, his, territories, also, he, had, supreme, jurisdiction, in, judicial, matters, made, legislation, led, the, army, and, protected, both, the, church, and, the, poor, his, administration, was, an, attempt, to, organize, the, kingdom, church, and, nobility, around, him, however, its, efficacy, was, directly, dependent, upon, the, efficiency, loyalty, and, support, of, his, subjects, almost, every, year, between, the, accession, of, charles, martel, and, the, conclusion, of, the, wars, with, the, saxons, frankish, forces, went, on, campaign, or, expedition, often, into, enemy, territory, charlemagne, would, for, many, years, gather, an, assembly, around, easter, and, launch, a, military, effort, that, would, typically, take, place, through, the, summer, as, this, would, ensure, there, were, enough, supplies, for, the, fighting, force, charlemagne, passed, regulations, requiring, all, mustered, fighting, men, to, own, and, bring, their, own, weapons, the, wealthy, cavalrymen, had, to, bring, their, own, armour, poor, men, had, to, bring, spears, and, shields, and, those, driving, the, carts, had, to, have, bows, and, arrows, in, their, possession, in, regards, to, provisions, men, were, instructed, not, to, eat, food, until, a, specific, location, was, reached, and, carts, should, carry, three, months, worth, of, food, and, six, months, worth, of, weapons, and, clothing, along, with, tools, preference, was, shown, towards, mobility, warfare, in, place, of, defence, in, depth, infrastructure, captured, fortifications, were, often, destroyed, so, they, could, not, be, used, to, resist, carolingian, authority, in, the, future, after, 800, and, during, the, reign, of, louis, the, pious, efforts, of, expansion, dwindled, tim, reuter, has, shown, that, many, military, efforts, during, louis, reign, were, largely, defensive, and, in, response, to, external, threats, it, had, long, been, held, that, carolingian, military, success, was, based, on, the, use, of, a, cavalry, force, created, by, charles, martel, in, the, 730s, however, it, is, clear, that, no, such, cavalry, revolution, took, place, in, the, carolingian, period, leading, up, to, and, during, the, reign, of, charlemagne, this, is, because, the, stirrup, was, not, known, to, the, franks, until, the, late, eighth, century, and, soldiers, on, horseback, would, therefore, have, used, swords, and, lances, for, striking, and, not, charging, carolingian, military, success, rested, primarily, on, siege, technologies, and, excellent, logistics, however, large, numbers, of, horses, were, used, by, the, frankish, military, during, the, age, of, charlemagne, this, was, because, horses, provided, a, quick, long, distance, method, of, transporting, troops, which, was, critical, to, building, and, maintaining, such, a, large, empire, the, importance, of, horses, to, the, carolingian, military, is, revealed, through, the, revised, version, of, the, royal, frankish, annals, the, annals, mention, that, whilst, charlemagne, was, on, campaign, in, 791, there, broke, out, such, a, pestilence, among, the, horses, that, barely, a, tenth, out, of, so, many, thousands, are, said, to, have, survived, shortage, of, horses, played, a, role, in, preventing, carolingian, forces, from, continuing, a, campaign, against, the, avars, in, pannonia, the, frankish, royal, bodyguards, the, continuation, of, the, merovingian, institution, of, the, antrustion, were, consciously, modelled, on, late, roman, precedents, these, guards, were, organized, into, schola, and, entitled, scholares, and, used, armour, based, on, late, roman, and, early, byzantine, models, frankish, artistic, depictions, of, these, bodyguards, also, mirrored, late, roman, traditions, no, permanent, capital, city, existed, in, the, empire, the, itinerant, court, being, a, typical, characteristic, of, all, western, european, kingdoms, at, this, time, some, palaces, can, however, be, distinguished, as, locations, of, central, administration, in, the, first, year, of, his, reign, charlemagne, went, to, aachen, french, aix, la, chapelle, italian, aquisgrana, he, began, to, build, a, palace, there, in, the, 780s, with, original, plans, being, thought, up, perhaps, as, soon, as, 768, the, palace, chapel, constructed, in, 796, later, became, aachen, cathedral, during, the, 790s, when, construction, picked, up, at, aachen, charlemagne, s, court, became, more, centred, compared, with, the, 770s, where, court, so, often, found, itself, located, in, tents, during, campaigning, though, aachen, was, certainly, not, intended, to, be, a, sedentary, capital, it, was, built, in, the, political, heartland, of, charlemagne, s, realm, to, act, as, a, meeting, place, for, aristocrats, and, churchmen, so, that, patronage, might, be, distributed, assemblies, held, laws, written, and, even, where, scholarly, churchmen, gathered, for, the, purposes, of, learning, aachen, was, also, a, centre, for, information, and, gossip, being, pulled, in, from, across, the, empire, by, courtiers, and, churchmen, alike, of, course, despite, being, the, centre, of, charlemagne, s, government, until, his, later, years, his, court, moved, often, and, made, use, of, other, palaces, at, frankfurt, ingelheim, and, nijmegen, the, use, of, such, structures, would, signal, the, beginnings, of, the, palace, system, of, government, used, by, the, carolingian, court, throughout, reigns, of, many, carolingian, rulers, stuart, airlie, has, suggested, that, there, were, over, 150, palaces, throughout, the, carolingian, world, which, would, provide, the, setting, for, court, activity, palaces, were, not, merely, locations, of, administrative, government, but, also, stood, as, important, symbols, under, charlemagne, their, excellence, was, a, translation, of, the, treasure, built, up, from, conquest, into, a, symbolic, permanence, as, well, as, exclaiming, royal, authority, einhard, suggested, the, construction, of, so, called, public, buildings, was, a, testament, to, charlemagne, s, greatness, and, likeness, to, the, emperors, of, antiquity, and, this, connection, was, certainly, capitalised, upon, by, the, imagery, of, palace, decorations, ingelheim, is, a, particular, example, of, such, symbolism, and, thus, the, importance, of, the, palace, system, in, more, than, mere, governance, the, palace, chapel, is, written, to, have, been, lined, with, images, from, the, bible, and, the, hall, of, the, palace, decorated, with, a, picture, cycle, celebrating, the, deeds, of, great, kings, including, rulers, of, antiquity, as, well, as, carolingian, rulers, such, as, charles, martel, and, pippin, iii, louis, the, pious, used, the, palace, system, much, to, the, same, effect, as, charlemagne, during, his, reign, as, king, of, aquitaine, rotating, his, court, between, four, winter, palaces, throughout, the, region, during, his, reign, as, emperor, he, used, aachen, ingelheim, frankfurt, and, mainz, which, were, almost, always, the, locations, for, general, assemblies, held, two, or, three, a, year, in, the, period, 896, 28, and, while, he, was, not, an, immobile, ruler, his, reign, has, certainly, been, described, as, more, static, in, this, way, the, palace, system, can, also, been, seen, as, a, tool, of, continuity, in, governance, after, the, splintering, of, the, empire, the, palace, system, continued, to, be, used, by, succeeding, carolingian, rulers, with, charles, the, bald, centring, his, power, at, compi, gne, where, the, palace, chapel, was, dedicated, to, the, virgin, mary, in, 877, something, remarked, on, as, a, sign, of, continuity, with, aachen, s, mother, of, god, chapel, for, louis, the, german, frankfurt, has, been, deemed, his, own, neo, aachen, and, charles, the, fat, s, palace, at, s, lestat, in, alsace, was, designed, specifically, to, imitate, aachen, the, palace, system, as, an, idea, for, carolingian, central, administration, and, governance, has, been, challenged, by, historian, f, l, ganshof, who, argued, that, the, palaces, of, the, carolingians, contained, nothing, resembling, the, specialised, services, and, departments, available, at, the, same, period, to, the, byzantine, emperor, or, the, caliph, of, baghdad, however, further, reading, in, the, works, of, carolingian, historians, such, as, matthew, innes, rosamond, mckitterick, and, stuart, airlie, suggest, that, the, use, of, palaces, were, important, in, the, evolution, of, carolingian, governance, and, janet, nelson, has, argued, that, palaces, are, places, from, which, power, emanates, and, is, exercised, and, the, importance, of, palaces, to, carolingian, administration, learning, and, legitimacy, has, been, widely, argued, the, royal, household, was, an, itinerant, body, until, c, 802, which, moved, around, the, kingdom, making, sure, good, government, was, upheld, in, the, localities, the, most, important, positions, were, the, chaplain, who, was, responsible, for, all, ecclesiastical, affairs, in, the, kingdom, and, the, count, of, the, palace, count, palatine, who, had, supreme, control, over, the, household, it, also, included, more, minor, officials, e, g, chamberlain, seneschal, and, marshal, the, household, sometimes, led, the, army, e, g, seneschal, andorf, against, the, bretons, in, 786, possibly, associated, with, the, chaplain, and, the, royal, chapel, was, the, office, of, the, chancellor, head, of, the, chancery, a, non, permanent, writing, office, the, charters, produced, were, rudimentary, and, mostly, to, do, with, land, deeds, there, are, 262, surviving, from, charles, reign, as, opposed, to, 40, from, pepin, s, and, 350, from, louis, the, pious, there, are, 3, main, offices, which, enforced, carolingian, authority, in, the, localities, the, comes, latin, count, appointed, by, charles, to, administer, a, county, the, carolingian, empire, except, bavaria, was, divided, up, into, between, 110, and, 600, counties, each, divided, into, centenae, which, were, under, the, control, of, a, vicar, at, first, they, were, royal, agents, sent, out, by, charles, but, after, c, 802, they, were, important, local, magnates, they, were, responsible, for, justice, enforcing, capitularies, levying, soldiers, receiving, tolls, and, dues, and, maintaining, roads, and, bridges, they, could, technically, be, dismissed, by, the, king, but, many, offices, became, hereditary, they, were, also, sometimes, corrupt, although, many, were, exemplary, e, g, count, eric, of, friuli, provincial, governors, eventually, evolved, who, supervised, several, counts, the, missi, dominici, latin, dominical, emissaries, originally, appointed, ad, hoc, a, reform, in, 802, led, to, the, office, of, missus, dominicus, becoming, a, permanent, one, the, missi, dominici, were, sent, out, in, pairs, one, was, an, ecclesiastic, and, one, secular, their, status, as, high, officials, was, thought, to, safeguard, them, from, the, temptation, of, taking, bribes, they, made, four, journeys, a, year, in, their, local, missaticum, each, lasting, a, month, and, were, responsible, for, making, the, royal, will, and, capitularies, known, judging, cases, and, occasionally, raising, armies, the, vassi, dominici, these, were, the, king, s, vassals, and, were, usually, the, sons, of, powerful, men, holding, benefices, and, forming, a, contingent, in, the, royal, army, they, also, went, on, ad, hoc, missions, around, 780, charlemagne, reformed, the, local, system, of, administering, justice, and, created, the, scabini, professional, experts, on, the, law, every, count, had, the, help, of, seven, of, these, scabini, who, were, supposed, to, know, every, national, law, so, that, all, men, could, be, judged, according, to, it, judges, were, also, banned, from, taking, bribes, and, were, supposed, to, use, sworn, inquests, to, establish, facts, in, 802, all, law, was, written, down, and, amended, the, salic, law, was, also, amended, in, both, 798, and, 802, although, even, einhard, admits, in, section, 29, that, this, was, imperfect, judges, were, supposed, to, have, a, copy, of, both, the, salic, law, code, and, the, ripuarian, law, code, most, people, in, the, carolingian, empire, lived, under, a, legal, code, that, directly, copied, from, roman, law, coinage, had, a, strong, association, with, the, roman, empire, and, charlemagne, took, up, its, regulation, with, his, other, imperial, duties, the, carolingians, exercised, controls, over, the, silver, coinage, of, the, realm, controlling, its, composition, and, value, the, name, of, the, emperor, not, of, the, minter, appeared, on, the, coins, charlemagne, worked, to, suppress, mints, in, northern, germany, on, the, baltic, sea, the, frankish, kingdom, was, subdivided, by, charlemagne, into, three, separate, areas, to, make, administration, easier, these, were, the, inner, core, of, the, kingdom, austrasia, neustria, and, burgundy, which, were, supervised, directly, by, the, missatica, system, and, the, itinerant, household, outside, this, was, the, regna, where, frankish, administration, rested, upon, the, counts, and, outside, this, was, the, marcher, areas, where, ruled, powerful, governors, these, marcher, lordships, were, present, in, brittany, spain, and, bavaria, charles, also, created, two, sub, kingdoms, in, aquitaine, and, italy, ruled, by, his, sons, louis, and, pepin, respectively, bavaria, was, also, under, the, command, of, an, autonomous, governor, gerold, until, his, death, in, 796, while, charles, still, had, overall, authority, in, these, areas, they, were, fairly, autonomous, with, their, own, chancery, and, minting, facilities, the, annual, meeting, the, placitum, generalis, or, marchfield, was, held, every, year, between, march, and, may, at, a, place, appointed, by, the, king, it, was, called, for, three, reasons, to, gather, the, frankish, host, to, go, on, a, campaign, to, discuss, political, and, ecclesiastical, matters, affecting, the, kingdom, and, to, legislate, for, them, and, to, make, judgments, all, important, men, had, to, go, to, the, meeting, and, so, it, was, an, important, way, for, charles, to, make, his, will, known, originally, the, meeting, worked, effectively, however, later, it, merely, became, a, forum, for, discussion, and, for, nobles, to, express, their, dissatisfaction, the, oath, of, fidelity, was, a, way, for, charles, to, ensure, loyalty, from, all, his, subjects, as, early, as, 779, he, banned, sworn, guilds, between, other, men, so, that, everyone, took, an, oath, of, loyalty, only, to, him, in, 789, in, response, to, the, 786, rebellion, he, began, legislating, that, everyone, should, swear, fidelity, to, him, as, king, however, in, 802, he, expanded, the, oath, greatly, and, made, it, so, that, all, men, over, age, 12, swore, it, to, him, capitularies, were, the, written, records, of, decisions, made, by, the, carolingian, kings, in, consultation, with, assemblies, during, the, eighth, and, ninth, century, the, name, comes, from, the, latin, capitula, for, chapters, and, refers, to, the, way, these, records, were, taken, and, written, up, in, a, chapter, by, chapter, style, they, are, regarded, as, being, amongst, the, most, important, sources, for, the, governance, of, the, frankish, empire, in, the, eight, and, ninth, century, by, s, ren, kaschke, the, use, of, capitularies, represent, a, change, in, the, pattern, of, contact, between, the, king, and, his, provinces, in, the, carolingian, period, the, contents, of, capitularies, could, include, a, wide, range, of, topics, including, royal, orders, instructions, for, specific, officials, deliberations, of, assemblies, on, both, secular, and, ecclesiastical, affairs, as, well, as, additions, and, alterations, to, the, law, primary, evidence, shows, that, capitularies, were, copied, and, disseminated, all, throughout, charlemagne, s, empire, however, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, suggest, the, efficacy, of, the, capitularies, and, whether, they, were, actually, put, into, practice, throughout, the, realm, as, charlemagne, became, increasingly, stationary, the, amount, of, capitularies, produced, increased, this, was, particularly, noticeable, after, the, general, admonition, of, 789, there, has, been, debates, over, the, purpose, of, capitularies, some, historians, argue, that, the, capitularies, were, nothing, more, than, a, royal, wish, list, while, others, argue, for, capitularies, representing, the, basis, of, a, centralised, state, capitularies, were, implemented, through, the, use, of, the, missi, royal, agents, who, would, travel, around, the, carolingian, kingdom, usually, in, pairs, of, a, secular, missi, and, ecclesiastical, missi, reading, out, copied, out, versions, of, the, latest, capitularies, to, assemblies, of, people, the, missi, also, had, other, roles, such, as, handling, complex, local, disputes, and, can, be, argued, to, have, been, crucial, to, the, success, of, both, capitularies, and, the, expansion, of, charlemagne, s, influence, some, notable, capitularies, from, charlemagne, s, reign, are, charlemagne, aimed, to, convert, all, those, in, the, frankish, kingdom, to, christianity, and, to, expand, both, his, empire, and, the, reach, of, christianity, the, 789, admonitio, generalis, pronounced, charlemagne, responsible, for, the, salvation, of, his, subjects, and, set, out, standards, of, education, for, the, clergy, who, previously, had, been, mostly, illiterate, intellectuals, of, the, time, began, to, be, concerned, with, eschatology, believing, 800, a, d, to, be, 6000, am, based, on, calculations, from, eusebius, and, jerome, intellectuals, such, as, alcuin, reckoned, that, the, charlemagne, s, coronation, as, emperor, on, christmas, day, 800, marked, the, beginning, of, the, seventh, and, final, age, of, the, world, these, concerns, may, explain, why, charlemagne, aimed, to, have, everyone, engage, in, acts, of, penance, for, other, carolingian, kings, see, list, of, frankish, kings, for, the, later, emperors, see, holy, roman, emperor, despite, the, relatively, short, existence, of, the, carolingian, empire, when, compared, to, other, european, dynastic, empires, its, legacy, far, outlasts, the, state, that, had, forged, it, in, historiographical, terms, the, carolingian, empire, is, seen, as, the, beginning, of, feudalism, or, rather, the, notion, of, feudalism, held, in, the, modern, era, though, most, historians, would, be, naturally, hesitant, to, assign, charles, martel, and, his, descendants, as, founders, of, feudalism, it, is, obvious, that, a, carolingian, template, lends, to, the, structure, of, central, medieval, political, culture, yet, some, argue, against, this, assumption, marc, bloch, disdained, this, hunt, for, feudalism, s, birth, as, the, idol, of, origins, a, concerted, effort, can, be, noted, by, carolingian, authors, such, as, einhard, to, establish, a, shift, in, continuity, from, the, merovingian, to, the, carolingian, likely, where, no, such, groundbreaking, difference, between, the, two, ever, existed, the, unifying, power, of, charlemagne, and, his, descendants, have, been, wielded, by, a, succession, of, european, rulers, to, bolster, their, own, regimes, much, in, the, same, vein, as, charlemagne, echoed, elements, of, augustus, in, his, rising, years, the, ottonian, dynasty, which, succeeded, the, title, of, holy, roman, emperor, magnified, distant, ties, to, the, carolingians, to, legitimise, their, dynastic, ambitions, as, successors, four, of, the, five, ottonian, emperors, to, rule, also, crowned, themselves, in, charlemagne, s, palace, in, aachen, likely, to, establish, a, continuity, between, the, carolingians, and, themselves, even, with, their, dynasty, originating, from, charlemagne, s, arch, foe, saxony, ottonians, still, linked, their, dynasty, to, the, carolingians, through, direct, and, indirect, means, further, iconography, of, charlemagne, himself, was, utilised, in, later, medieval, periods, where, he, is, depicted, as, a, model, knight, and, paragon, of, chivalry
