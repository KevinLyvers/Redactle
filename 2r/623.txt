petra, arabic, romanized, al, batr, greek, rock, originally, known, to, its, inhabitants, as, raqmu, nabataean, or, raq, m, is, a, historic, and, archaeological, city, in, southern, jordan, famous, for, its, rock, cut, architecture, and, water, conduit, systems, petra, is, also, called, the, rose, city, because, of, the, colour, of, the, sandstone, from, which, it, is, carved, the, city, is, one, of, the, new, 7, wonders, of, the, world, and, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, the, area, around, petra, has, been, inhabited, from, as, early, as, 7000, bc, and, was, settled, by, the, nabataeans, a, nomadic, arab, people, in, the, 4th, century, bc, petra, would, later, become, the, capital, city, of, the, nabataean, kingdom, in, the, second, century, bc, the, nabataeans, invested, in, petra, s, proximity, to, the, incense, trade, routes, by, establishing, it, as, a, major, regional, trading, hub, which, gained, them, considerable, revenue, unlike, their, enemies, the, nabataeans, were, accustomed, to, living, in, the, barren, deserts, and, thus, were, able, to, defend, their, kingdom, they, were, particularly, skillful, in, agriculture, stone, carving, and, rainwater, harvesting, petra, flourished, in, the, 1st, century, ad, when, its, al, khazneh, structure, possibly, the, mausoleum, of, nabataean, king, aretas, iv, was, constructed, and, its, population, peaked, at, an, estimated, 20, 000, inhabitants, nabataea, fell, to, the, romans, in, 106, ad, who, annexed, and, renamed, it, as, arabia, petraea, petra, s, importance, declined, as, sea, trade, routes, emerged, and, after, an, earthquake, in, 363, destroyed, many, structures, in, the, byzantine, era, several, christian, churches, were, built, but, the, city, continued, to, decline, and, by, the, early, islamic, era, it, was, abandoned, except, for, a, handful, of, nomads, it, remained, unknown, to, the, western, world, until, 1812, when, swiss, traveller, johann, ludwig, burckhardt, rediscovered, it, unesco, has, described, petra, as, one, of, the, most, precious, cultural, properties, of, man, s, cultural, heritage, petra, is, a, symbol, of, jordan, as, well, as, jordan, s, most, visited, tourist, attraction, tourist, numbers, peaked, at, 1, 1, million, in, 2019, marking, the, first, time, that, the, figure, rose, above, the, 1, million, mark, tourism, in, the, historical, city, was, hit, hard, by, the, covid, 19, pandemic, but, soon, after, started, to, pick, up, again, reaching, 905, 000, visitors, in, 2022, by, 7000, bc, some, of, the, earliest, recorded, farmers, had, settled, in, beidha, a, pre, pottery, neolithic, settlement, just, north, of, petra, petra, is, listed, in, egyptian, campaign, accounts, and, the, amarna, letters, as, pel, sela, or, seir, the, iron, age, lasted, between, 1200, and, 600, bc, in, that, time, the, petra, area, was, occupied, by, the, edomites, the, configuration, of, mountains, in, petra, allowed, for, a, reservoir, of, water, for, the, edomites, this, made, petra, a, stopping, ground, for, merchants, making, it, an, outstanding, area, for, trade, things, that, were, traded, here, included, wines, olive, oil, and, wood, initially, the, edomites, were, accompanied, by, nomads, who, eventually, left, but, the, edomites, stayed, and, made, their, mark, on, petra, before, the, emergence, of, the, nabataens, it, is, said, that, 10, 000, men, were, thrown, off, of, the, mountain, umm, el, biyara, but, this, story, has, been, debated, by, scholars, the, edomite, site, excavated, at, the, top, of, the, umm, el, biyara, mountain, at, petra, was, established, no, earlier, than, the, seventh, century, bc, iron, ii, the, nabataeans, were, one, among, several, nomadic, bedouin, tribes, that, roamed, the, arabian, desert, and, moved, with, their, herds, to, wherever, they, could, find, pasture, and, water, although, the, nabataeans, were, initially, embedded, in, aramaic, culture, theories, about, them, having, aramean, roots, are, rejected, by, many, modern, scholars, instead, archaeological, religious, and, linguistic, evidence, confirm, that, they, are, a, northern, arabian, tribe, current, evidence, suggests, that, the, nabataean, name, for, petra, was, raq, m, variously, spelled, in, inscriptions, as, rqmw, or, rqm, the, jewish, historian, josephus, ca, 37, 100, ad, writes, that, the, region, was, inhabited, by, the, midianites, during, the, time, of, moses, and, that, they, were, ruled, by, five, kings, one, of, whom, was, rekem, josephus, mentions, that, the, city, called, petra, by, the, greeks, ranks, highest, in, the, land, of, the, arabs, and, was, still, called, rekeme, by, all, the, arabs, of, his, time, after, its, royal, founder, antiquities, iv, 7, 1, 4, 7, the, onomasticon, of, eusebius, also, identified, rekem, as, petra, arabic, raqama, means, to, mark, to, decorate, so, rekeme, could, be, a, nabataean, word, referring, to, the, famous, carved, rock, fa, ades, in, 1964, workmen, clearing, rubble, away, from, the, cliff, at, the, entrance, to, the, gorge, found, several, funerary, inscriptions, in, nabatean, script, one, of, them, was, to, a, certain, petraios, who, was, born, in, raqmu, rekem, and, buried, in, garshu, jerash, an, old, theory, held, that, petra, might, be, identified, with, a, place, called, sela, in, the, hebrew, bible, encyclop, dia, britannica, 1911, states, that, the, semitic, name, of, the, city, if, not, sela, would, remain, unknown, it, nevertheless, cautioned, that, sela, simply, means, rock, in, hebrew, and, thence, might, not, be, identified, with, a, city, where, it, occurs, in, the, biblical, text, in, the, book, of, obadiah, it, is, possible, that, the, city, was, part, of, the, nation, of, edom, the, passage, in, diodorus, siculus, xix, 94, 97, which, describes, the, expeditions, which, antigonus, sent, against, the, nabataeans, in, 312, bc, was, understood, by, some, researchers, to, throw, some, light, upon, the, history, of, petra, but, the, petra, greek, for, rock, referred, to, as, a, natural, fortress, and, place, of, refuge, cannot, be, a, proper, name, and, the, description, implies, that, there, was, no, town, in, existence, there, at, the, time, in, ad, 106, when, cornelius, palma, was, governor, of, syria, the, part, of, arabia, under, the, rule, of, petra, was, absorbed, into, the, roman, empire, as, part, of, arabia, petraea, and, petra, became, its, capital, the, native, dynasty, came, to, an, end, but, the, city, continued, to, flourish, under, roman, rule, it, was, around, this, time, that, the, petra, roman, road, was, built, a, century, later, in, the, time, of, alexander, severus, when, the, city, was, at, the, height, of, its, splendor, the, issue, of, coinage, came, to, an, end, there, was, no, more, building, of, sumptuous, tombs, owing, apparently, to, some, sudden, catastrophe, such, as, an, invasion, by, the, neo, persian, power, under, the, sassanid, empire, meanwhile, as, palmyra, fl, 130, 270, grew, in, importance, and, attracted, the, arabian, trade, away, from, petra, the, latter, declined, it, appears, however, to, have, lingered, on, as, a, religious, center, another, roman, road, was, constructed, at, the, site, epiphanius, of, salamis, c, 315, 403, writes, that, in, his, time, a, feast, was, held, there, on, december, 25, in, honor, of, the, virgin, khaabou, chaabou, and, her, offspring, dushara, dushara, and, al, uzza, were, two, of, the, main, deities, of, the, city, which, otherwise, included, many, idols, from, other, nabataean, deities, such, as, allat, and, manat, between, 111, and, 114, trajan, built, the, via, traiana, nova, running, from, the, syrian, border, to, the, red, sea, through, petra, this, road, followed, the, old, routes, of, nabataean, caravans, in, the, shadow, of, the, pax, romana, this, route, revived, trade, between, arabia, syria, and, mediterranean, harbors, in, 125, ad, one, of, emperor, hadrian, s, administrators, left, marks, in, petra, pointed, out, by, documents, found, at, the, dead, sea, in, 130, ad, hadrian, visited, the, former, nabataean, capital, giving, it, the, name, of, hadri, n, petra, metropolis, imprinted, on, his, coins, his, visit, however, did, not, lead, to, any, boom, in, development, and, new, buildings, as, it, did, in, jerash, the, province, s, governor, sextius, florentinus, erected, a, monumental, mausoleum, for, his, son, near, the, end, of, the, al, hubta, king, s, wall, tombs, which, had, been, generally, reserved, during, the, nabataean, period, for, the, royal, family, the, interest, that, roman, emperors, showed, in, the, city, in, the, 3rd, century, suggests, that, petra, and, its, environs, remained, highly, esteemed, for, a, long, time, an, inscription, to, liber, pater, a, god, revered, by, emperor, septimius, severus, was, found, in, the, temenos, of, the, temple, known, as, qasr, al, bint, and, nabataean, tombs, contained, silver, coins, with, the, emperor, s, portrait, as, well, as, pottery, from, his, reign, emperor, elagabalus, declared, petra, to, be, a, roman, colony, when, he, reorganized, the, roman, empire, towards, the, end, of, the, 3rd, century, the, area, from, petra, to, wadi, mujib, the, negev, and, the, sinai, peninsula, were, annexed, into, the, province, of, palaestina, salutaris, petra, may, be, seen, on, the, madaba, mosaic, map, from, the, reign, of, emperor, justinian, petra, declined, rapidly, under, roman, rule, in, large, part, from, the, revision, of, sea, based, trade, routes, in, 363, an, earthquake, destroyed, many, buildings, and, crippled, the, vital, water, management, system, the, old, city, of, petra, was, the, capital, of, the, byzantine, province, of, palaestina, iii, and, many, churches, from, the, byzantine, period, were, excavated, in, and, around, petra, in, one, of, them, the, byzantine, church, 140, papyri, were, discovered, which, contained, mainly, contracts, dated, from, 530s, to, 590s, establishing, that, the, city, was, still, flourishing, in, the, 6th, century, the, byzantine, church, is, a, prime, example, of, monumental, architecture, in, byzantine, petra, the, last, reference, to, byzantine, petra, comes, from, the, spiritual, meadow, of, john, moschus, written, in, the, first, decades, of, the, 7th, century, he, gives, an, anecdote, about, its, bishop, athenogenes, it, ceased, to, be, a, metropolitan, bishopric, sometime, before, 687, when, that, function, had, been, transferred, to, areopolis, petra, is, not, mentioned, in, the, narratives, of, the, muslim, conquest, of, the, levant, nor, does, it, appear, in, any, early, islamic, records, in, the, 12th, century, the, crusaders, built, fortresses, such, as, the, alwaeira, castle, but, were, forced, to, abandon, petra, after, a, while, as, a, result, the, location, of, petra, was, lost, until, the, 19th, century, two, further, crusader, period, castles, are, known, in, and, around, petra, the, first, is, al, wu, ayra, situated, just, north, of, wadi, musa, it, can, be, viewed, from, the, road, to, little, petra, it, is, the, castle, that, was, seized, by, a, band, of, turks, with, the, help, of, local, muslims, and, only, recovered, by, the, crusaders, after, they, began, to, destroy, the, olive, trees, of, wadi, musa, the, potential, loss, of, livelihood, led, the, locals, to, negotiate, a, surrender, the, second, is, on, the, summit, of, el, habis, in, the, heart, of, petra, and, can, be, accessed, from, the, west, side, of, the, qasr, al, bint, the, ruins, of, petra, were, an, object, of, curiosity, during, the, middle, ages, and, were, visited, by, baibars, one, of, the, first, mamluk, sultans, of, egypt, towards, the, end, of, the, 13th, century, the, first, european, to, describe, them, was, the, swiss, traveler, johann, ludwig, burckhardt, during, his, travels, in, 1812, at, that, time, the, greek, orthodox, patriarchate, of, jerusalem, operated, a, diocese, in, al, karak, named, battra, arabic, ancient, greek, and, it, was, the, opinion, among, the, clergy, of, jerusalem, that, kerak, was, the, ancient, city, of, petra, burckhardt, already, spoke, arabic, fluently, and, was, on, his, way, to, explore, the, niger, river, when, he, heard, stories, of, a, dead, city, that, held, the, tomb, of, the, prophet, aaron, and, became, fascinated, with, finding, the, city, he, then, dressed, himself, up, as, a, local, and, only, spoke, in, arabic, bringing, a, goat, with, him, with, the, intent, of, sacrificing, it, in, honor, of, aaron, s, tomb, after, one, day, of, exploring, he, was, convinced, that, he, had, found, the, lost, city, of, petra, l, on, de, laborde, and, louis, maurice, adolphe, linant, de, bellefonds, made, the, first, accurate, drawings, of, petra, in, 1828, the, scottish, painter, david, roberts, visited, petra, in, 1839, and, returned, to, britain, with, sketches, and, stories, of, the, encounter, with, local, tribes, published, in, the, holy, land, syria, idumea, arabia, egypt, and, nubia, frederic, edwin, church, the, leading, american, landscape, painter, of, the, 19th, century, visited, petra, in, 1868, and, the, resulting, painting, el, khasn, petra, is, among, his, most, important, and, well, documented, missionary, archibald, forder, published, photographs, of, petra, in, the, december, 1909, issue, of, national, geographic, because, the, structures, weakened, with, age, many, of, the, tombs, became, vulnerable, to, thieves, and, many, treasures, were, stolen, in, 1929, a, four, person, team, consisting, of, british, archaeologists, agnes, conway, and, george, horsfield, palestinian, physician, and, folklore, expert, tawfiq, canaan, and, ditlef, nielsen, a, danish, scholar, excavated, and, surveyed, petra, the, archaeologist, philip, hammond, from, the, university, of, utah, visited, petra, for, nearly, 40, years, he, explained, that, the, local, folklore, says, it, was, created, by, the, wand, of, moses, when, he, struck, the, rock, to, bring, forth, water, for, the, israelites, hammond, believed, the, carved, channels, deep, within, the, walls, and, ground, were, made, from, ceramic, pipes, that, once, fed, water, for, the, city, from, rock, cut, systems, on, the, canyon, rim, in, the, 1980s, the, bedul, bedouin, once, inhabitants, of, petra, were, relocated, by, the, jordanian, government, to, the, nearby, settlement, of, umm, sayhoun, a, process, spanning, two, decades, this, move, was, part, of, broader, initiatives, aimed, at, settling, bedouin, communities, and, promoting, tourism, in, petra, with, a, name, meaning, the, changing, ones, and, oral, traditions, recounting, a, conversion, narrative, the, bedul, bedouins, are, believed, to, have, adopted, islam, later, in, their, history, possibly, with, jewish, or, nabatean, origins, today, alongside, their, traditional, activities, they, engage, in, local, tourism, alongside, the, more, prominent, liyathnah, tribe, numerous, scrolls, in, greek, and, dating, to, the, byzantine, period, were, discovered, in, an, excavated, church, near, the, temple, of, the, winged, lions, in, petra, in, december, 1993, in, december, 2022, petra, was, hit, by, heavy, flooding, petra, is, adjacent, to, the, mountain, of, jabal, al, madbah, in, a, basin, surrounded, by, mountains, forming, the, eastern, flank, of, the, arabah, valley, running, from, the, dead, sea, to, the, gulf, of, aqaba, excavations, have, demonstrated, that, it, was, the, ability, of, the, nabataeans, to, control, the, water, supply, that, led, to, the, rise, of, the, desert, city, creating, an, artificial, oasis, the, area, is, visited, by, flash, floods, but, archaeological, evidence, shows, that, the, nabataeans, controlled, these, floods, by, the, use, of, dams, cisterns, and, water, conduits, these, innovations, stored, water, for, prolonged, periods, of, drought, and, enabled, the, city, to, prosper, from, its, sale, in, ancient, times, petra, might, have, been, approached, from, the, south, on, a, track, leading, across, the, plain, of, petra, around, jabal, haroun, aaron, s, mountain, the, location, of, the, tomb, of, aaron, said, to, be, the, burial, place, of, aaron, brother, of, moses, another, approach, was, possibly, from, the, high, plateau, to, the, north, today, most, modern, visitors, approach, the, site, from, the, east, the, impressive, eastern, entrance, leads, steeply, down, through, a, dark, narrow, gorge, in, places, only, 3, 4, m, 10, 13, ft, wide, called, the, siq, shaft, a, natural, geological, feature, formed, from, a, deep, split, in, the, sandstone, rocks, and, serving, as, a, waterway, flowing, into, wadi, musa, petra, is, known, primarily, for, its, hellenistic, architecture, the, facades, of, the, tombs, in, petra, are, commonly, rendered, in, hellenistic, style, reflecting, the, number, of, diverse, cultures, which, the, nabataens, traded, all, of, which, were, in, turn, influenced, by, greek, culture, most, of, these, tombs, contain, small, burials, niches, carved, into, the, stone, perhaps, the, best, example, of, the, hellenistic, style, is, seen, in, the, treasury, which, is, 24, meters, 79, ft, wide, and, 37, meters, 121, ft, tall, and, references, the, architecture, of, alexandria, the, facade, of, the, treasury, features, a, broken, pediment, with, a, central, tholos, inside, and, two, obelisks, appear, to, form, into, the, rock, at, the, top, near, the, bottom, of, the, treasury, are, the, twin, greek, gods, castor, and, pollux, who, protect, travellers, on, their, journeys, near, the, top, of, the, treasury, two, victories, are, seen, standing, on, each, side, of, a, female, figure, on, the, tholos, this, female, figure, is, believed, to, be, the, isis, tyche, isis, and, tyche, being, the, egyptian, and, greek, goddesses, respectively, of, good, fortune, another, prime, example, of, hellenistic, architecture, featured, in, petra, is, its, monastery, which, stands, at, 45, meters, 148, ft, tall, and, 50, meters, 160, ft, wide, this, is, petra, s, largest, monument, and, is, similarly, carved, into, the, rock, face, the, facade, of, this, again, features, a, broken, pediment, similar, to, the, treasury, as, well, as, another, central, tholos, the, monastery, displays, more, of, a, nabataen, touch, while, at, the, same, time, incorporating, elements, from, greek, architecture, its, only, source, of, light, is, its, entrance, standing, at, 8, meters, 26, ft, high, there, is, a, large, space, outside, of, the, monastery, which, is, purposefully, flattened, for, worship, purposes, formerly, in, the, byzantine, period, this, was, a, place, for, christian, worship, but, is, now, a, holy, site, for, pilgrims, to, visit, at, the, end, of, the, narrow, gorge, the, siq, stands, petra, s, most, elaborate, ruin, popularly, known, as, al, khazneh, the, treasury, hewn, into, the, sandstone, cliff, while, remaining, in, remarkably, preserved, condition, the, face, of, the, structure, is, marked, by, hundreds, of, bullet, holes, made, by, the, local, bedouin, tribes, that, hoped, to, dislodge, riches, that, were, once, rumoured, to, be, hidden, within, it, a, little, farther, from, the, treasury, at, the, foot, of, the, mountain, called, en, nejr, is, a, massive, theatre, positioned, so, as, to, bring, the, greatest, number, of, tombs, within, view, at, the, point, where, the, valley, opens, out, into, the, plain, the, site, of, the, city, is, revealed, with, striking, effect, the, theatre, was, cut, into, the, hillside, and, into, several, of, the, tombs, during, its, construction, rectangular, gaps, in, the, seating, are, still, visible, almost, enclosing, it, on, three, sides, are, rose, coloured, mountain, walls, divided, into, groups, by, deep, fissures, and, lined, with, knobs, cut, from, the, rock, in, the, form, of, towers, the, theatre, was, said, to, hold, around, 8, 500, people, the, performances, that, audiences, were, able, to, attend, here, were, poetry, readings, and, dramas, gladiator, fights, were, also, said, to, be, held, here, and, attracted, the, most, audience, although, no, gladiator, was, able, to, gain, any, momentum, or, fame, due, to, the, heavy, mortality, rate, that, came, with, it, the, theatre, was, one, of, many, structures, in, petra, that, took, significant, damage, due, to, the, 363, galilee, earthquake, the, petra, pool, and, garden, complex, is, a, series, of, structures, within, the, city, center, originally, said, to, be, a, market, area, excavations, at, the, site, have, allowed, scholars, to, identify, it, as, an, elaborate, nabataean, garden, which, included, a, large, swimming, pool, an, island, pavilion, and, an, intricate, hydraulic, system, ahead, of, the, petra, pool, and, garden, complex, lies, colonnaded, street, which, is, among, few, artifacts, of, petra, that, was, constructed, rather, than, natural, this, street, used, to, hold, a, semi, circle, nymphaeum, which, is, now, in, ruins, due, to, flash, flooding, and, used, to, hold, petra, s, only, tree, this, was, intended, to, be, a, symbol, for, the, peaceful, atmosphere, that, the, nabataens, were, able, to, construct, in, petra, once, the, romans, took, control, of, the, city, colonnaded, street, was, narrowed, to, make, room, for, a, side, walk, and, 72, columns, were, added, to, each, side, the, high, place, of, sacrifice, is, perched, atop, jebel, madbah, mountain, the, beginning, of, the, hike, is, near, petra, s, theatre, from, there, the, site, of, the, high, place, of, sacrifice, is, around, an, 800, step, hike, one, commonly, believed, sacrifice, that, took, place, there, was, libation, another, common, form, of, sacrifice, that, took, place, there, was, animal, sacrifice, this, is, due, to, the, belief, that, the, tomb, of, the, prophet, aaron, is, located, in, petra, which, is, a, sacred, site, for, muslims, in, honor, of, this, a, goat, was, sacrificed, annually, other, rituals, also, took, place, there, including, the, burning, of, frankincense, the, royal, tombs, of, petra, are, in, the, nabatean, version, of, hellenistic, architecture, but, their, facades, have, worn, due, to, natural, decay, one, of, these, tombs, the, palace, tomb, is, speculated, to, be, the, tomb, for, the, kings, of, petra, the, corinthian, tomb, which, is, right, next, to, the, palace, tomb, has, the, same, hellenistic, architecture, featured, on, the, treasury, the, two, other, royal, tombs, are, the, silk, tomb, and, the, urn, tomb, the, silk, tomb, does, not, stand, out, as, much, as, the, urn, tomb, the, urn, tomb, features, a, large, yard, in, its, front, and, was, turned, into, a, church, in, 446, ad, after, the, expansion, of, christianity, in, 2016, archaeologists, using, satellite, imagery, and, drones, discovered, a, very, large, previously, unknown, monumental, structure, whose, beginnings, were, tentatively, dated, to, about, 150, bc, the, time, when, the, nabataeans, initiated, their, public, building, programme, it, is, located, outside, the, main, area, of, the, city, at, the, foot, of, jabal, an, nmayr, and, about, 0, 5, mi, 0, 8, km, south, of, the, city, centre, but, is, facing, east, not, towards, the, city, and, has, no, visible, relationship, to, it, the, structure, consists, of, a, huge, 184, by, 161, ft, 56, by, 49, m, platform, with, a, monumental, staircase, along, its, eastern, side, the, large, platform, enclosed, a, slightly, smaller, one, topped, with, a, comparatively, small, building, 28, by, 28, ft, 8, 5, by, 8, 5, m, which, was, facing, east, toward, the, staircase, the, structure, second, in, size, only, to, the, monastery, complex, probably, had, a, ceremonial, function, of, which, not, even, a, speculative, explanation, has, yet, been, offered, by, the, researchers, pliny, the, elder, and, other, writers, identify, petra, as, the, capital, of, the, nabataean, kingdom, and, the, centre, of, their, caravan, trade, enclosed, by, towering, rocks, and, watered, by, a, perennial, stream, petra, not,
