the, history, of, political, thought, encompasses, the, chronology, and, the, substantive, and, methodological, changes, of, human, political, thought, the, study, of, the, history, of, political, thought, represents, an, intersection, of, various, academic, disciplines, such, as, philosophy, law, history, and, political, science, many, histories, of, western, political, thought, trace, its, origins, to, ancient, greece, specifically, to, athenian, democracy, and, ancient, greek, philosophy, the, political, philosophy, of, thinkers, such, as, socrates, plato, and, aristotle, are, traditionally, elevated, as, exceptionally, important, and, influential, in, such, works, non, western, traditions, and, histories, of, political, thought, have, by, comparison, often, been, underrepresented, in, academic, research, such, non, western, traditions, of, political, thought, have, been, identified, among, others, in, ancient, china, specifically, in, the, form, of, early, chinese, philosophy, and, in, ancient, india, where, the, arthashastra, represents, an, early, treatise, on, governance, and, politics, another, notable, non, western, school, of, political, thought, emerged, in, the, 7th, century, when, the, spread, of, islam, rapidly, expanded, the, outreach, of, islamic, political, philosophy, the, study, of, the, history, of, political, thought, has, inspired, academic, journals, and, has, been, furthered, by, university, programs, from, around, 770, bce, china, began, to, experience, a, time, of, peace, and, prosperity, which, allowed, the, rise, of, the, so, called, hundred, schools, of, thought, the, most, influential, of, which, was, that, of, confucius, his, thinking, was, firmly, based, in, traditional, chinese, worldview, which, saw, the, values, of, loyalty, duty, and, respect, as, paramount, he, believed, that, people, and, society, can, be, improved, by, reciprocal, treatment, through, moral, example, set, by, a, leader, embodying, these, virtues, as, society, would, then, respond, to, such, good, leaders, by, emulating, them, he, encapsulated, this, by, saying, that, if, your, desire, is, for, good, the, people, will, be, good, the, moral, character, of, the, ruler, is, the, wind, the, moral, character, of, those, beneath, him, is, the, grass, when, the, wind, blows, the, grass, bends, for, this, to, work, however, society, had, to, be, ordered, hierarchically, modeled, after, the, patriarchal, family, and, headed, by, an, absolute, sovereign, however, confucius, also, believed, the, state, should, employ, a, meritocratic, class, of, administrators, and, advisers, recruited, by, civil, service, exams, among, later, chinese, thinkers, mozi, agreed, with, his, ideas, of, meritocracy, and, leading, by, example, but, opposed, the, family, model, of, governance, with, the, belief, that, it, would, be, nepotistic, mencius, however, championed, his, ideas, later, on, an, alternative, chinese, philosophy, called, legalism, argued, that, instead, of, virtue, authoritarian, discipline, was, crucial, for, the, governance, of, the, state, the, origins, of, european, political, thought, are, in, ancient, rome, and, greece, starting, in, approximately, 600, bce, thinkers, in, these, societies, began, to, consider, questions, of, how, to, organize, societies, as, part, of, their, more, broad, considerations, of, ethics, and, how, to, live, the, good, life, in, the, intellectual, golden, age, of, the, fifth, century, athenian, democracy, plato, had, the, freedom, to, develop, his, ideas, although, he, nevertheless, despised, democracy, alongside, all, other, then, existing, form, of, government, this, was, because, plato, believed, that, the, state, should, promote, the, virtues, necessary, for, good, living, but, thought, the, existing, political, arrangements, of, monarchy, oligarchy, and, democracy, all, promoted, the, interests, of, the, people, in, power, who, were, ignorant, of, those, virtues, and, instead, would, only, pursue, honour, and, wealth, leading, to, conflict, and, injustice, to, correct, this, plato, proposed, in, the, republic, for, philosopher, kings, who, would, know, how, to, achieve, the, good, life, to, be, in, power, instead, in, india, chanakya, c, 4th, century, bce, offered, in, arthashastra, practical, advice, on, how, to, run, government, he, also, believed, that, virtue, in, the, leader, and, the, merit, of, their, advisers, were, important, furthermore, he, also, argued, that, the, end, justifies, the, means, and, that, after, using, the, best, means, available, to, defeat, their, enemies, rulers, should, substitute, virtues, for, the, defeated, enemy, s, vices, and, where, the, enemy, was, good, shall, be, twice, as, good, prior, to, him, manu, wrote, about, similar, topics, in, his, manusmriti, the, early, christian, philosophy, of, augustine, of, hippo, was, by, and, large, a, rewrite, of, plato, in, a, christian, context, the, main, change, that, christianity, wrought, was, to, moderate, the, stoicism, and, theory, of, justice, of, the, roman, world, and, emphasize, the, role, of, the, state, in, applying, mercy, as, a, moral, example, augustine, also, preached, that, one, was, not, a, member, of, his, or, her, city, but, was, either, a, citizen, of, the, city, of, god, civitas, dei, or, the, city, of, man, civitas, terrena, augustine, s, city, of, god, is, an, influential, work, of, this, period, that, refuted, the, thesis, after, the, first, sack, of, rome, that, the, christian, view, could, be, realized, on, earth, at, all, a, view, many, christian, romans, held, in, the, medieval, period, political, philosophy, in, europe, was, heavily, influenced, by, christian, thinking, it, had, much, in, common, with, islamic, attitudes, in, that, the, western, church, similarly, subordinated, philosophy, to, theology, perhaps, the, most, influential, political, philosopher, of, medieval, europe, was, st, thomas, aquinas, who, helped, reintroduce, aristotle, s, works, which, with, the, exception, of, the, politics, which, was, translated, directly, from, greek, to, latin, by, william, of, moerbeke, had, only, been, preserved, by, muslim, scholars, along, with, the, commentaries, of, averroes, aquinas, s, use, of, them, set, the, agenda, for, scholastic, political, philosophy, which, dominated, european, thought, for, centuries, in, 1215, the, magna, carta, introduced, the, concept, of, constitutional, rights, such, as, habeas, corpus, the, rise, of, islam, based, on, both, the, qur, an, and, muhammad, strongly, altered, the, power, balances, and, perceptions, of, origin, of, power, in, the, mediterranean, region, early, islamic, philosophy, emphasized, an, inexorable, link, between, science, and, religion, and, the, process, of, ijtihad, to, find, truth, in, effect, all, philosophy, was, political, as, it, had, real, implications, for, governance, this, view, was, challenged, by, the, mutazilite, philosophers, who, held, a, more, greek, view, and, were, supported, by, secular, aristocracy, who, sought, freedom, of, action, independent, of, the, caliphate, by, the, late, medieval, period, however, the, asharite, view, of, islam, had, in, general, triumphed, islamic, political, philosophy, was, indeed, rooted, in, the, very, sources, of, islam, i, e, the, qur, an, and, the, sunnah, the, words, and, practices, of, muhammad, however, in, the, western, thought, it, is, generally, supposed, that, it, was, a, specific, area, peculiar, merely, to, the, great, philosophers, of, islam, al, kindi, alkindus, al, farabi, abunaser, bn, sina, avicenna, ibn, bajjah, avempace, ibn, rushd, averroes, and, ibn, khaldun, the, political, conceptions, of, islam, such, as, kudrah, sultan, ummah, simaa, and, even, the, core, terms, of, the, qur, an, i, e, ibada, din, rab, and, ilah, is, taken, as, the, basis, of, an, analysis, hence, not, only, the, ideas, of, the, muslim, political, philosophers, but, also, many, other, jurists, and, ulama, posed, political, ideas, and, theories, for, example, the, ideas, of, the, khawarij, in, the, very, early, years, of, islamic, history, on, khilafa, and, ummah, or, that, of, shia, islam, on, the, concept, of, imamah, are, considered, proofs, of, political, thought, the, clashes, between, the, ehl, i, sunna, and, shia, in, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, had, a, genuine, political, character, the, 14th, century, arab, scholar, ibn, khaldun, is, considered, one, of, the, greatest, political, theorists, the, british, philosopher, anthropologist, ernest, gellner, considered, ibn, khaldun, s, definition, of, government, an, institution, which, prevents, injustice, other, than, such, as, it, commits, itself, the, best, in, the, history, of, political, theory, during, the, renaissance, secular, political, philosophy, began, to, emerge, after, about, a, century, of, theological, political, thought, in, europe, one, of, the, most, influential, works, during, this, burgeoning, period, was, niccol, machiavelli, s, the, prince, written, between, 1511, and, 1512, and, published, in, 1532, after, machiavelli, s, death, that, work, as, well, as, the, discourses, a, rigorous, analysis, of, the, classical, period, did, much, to, influence, modern, political, thought, in, the, west, a, minority, including, jean, jacques, rousseau, would, interpret, the, prince, as, satire, meant, to, imply, the, medici, after, their, recapture, of, florence, and, their, subsequent, expulsion, of, machiavelli, from, florence, though, the, work, was, written, for, the, medici, family, in, order, to, perhaps, influence, them, to, free, him, from, exile, machiavelli, supported, the, republic, of, florence, rather, than, the, oligarchy, of, the, medici, family, at, any, rate, machiavelli, presents, a, pragmatic, and, somewhat, consequentialist, view, of, politics, whereby, good, and, evil, are, mere, means, used, to, bring, about, an, end, i, e, the, maintenance, of, political, authority, thomas, hobbes, well, known, for, his, theory, of, the, social, contract, goes, on, to, expand, this, view, at, the, start, of, the, 17th, century, during, the, english, renaissance, john, locke, in, particular, exemplified, this, new, age, of, political, theory, with, his, work, two, treatises, of, government, in, it, locke, proposes, a, state, of, nature, theory, that, directly, complements, his, conception, of, how, political, development, occurs, and, how, it, can, be, founded, through, contractual, obligation, locke, stood, to, refute, sir, robert, filmer, s, paternally, founded, political, theory, in, favor, of, a, natural, system, based, on, nature, in, a, particular, given, system, during, the, enlightenment, period, new, theories, about, what, the, human, was, and, is, and, about, the, definition, of, reality, and, the, way, it, was, perceived, along, with, the, discovery, of, other, societies, in, the, americas, and, the, changing, needs, of, political, societies, especially, in, the, wake, of, the, english, civil, war, the, american, revolution, and, the, french, revolution, led, to, new, questions, and, insights, by, such, thinkers, as, jean, jacques, rousseau, montesquieu, and, john, locke, these, theorists, were, driven, by, two, basic, questions, one, by, what, right, or, need, do, people, form, states, and, two, what, is, the, best, form, a, state, can, take, these, fundamental, questions, involved, a, distinction, between, the, concepts, of, state, and, government, it, was, decided, that, state, would, refer, to, a, set, of, enduring, institutions, through, which, power, would, be, distributed, and, its, use, justified, the, term, government, would, refer, to, a, specific, group, of, people, who, occupied, the, state, at, any, given, time, and, created, the, laws, and, ordinances, by, which, the, people, the, government, included, would, be, bound, this, conceptual, distinction, continues, to, operate, in, political, science, although, some, political, scientists, philosophers, historians, and, cultural, anthropologists, have, argued, that, most, political, action, in, any, given, society, occurs, outside, of, its, state, and, that, there, are, societies, that, are, not, organized, into, states, which, nevertheless, must, be, considered, in, political, terms, political, and, economic, relations, were, drastically, influenced, by, these, theories, as, the, concept, of, the, guild, was, subordinated, to, the, theory, of, free, trade, and, roman, catholic, dominance, of, theology, was, increasingly, challenged, by, protestant, churches, subordinate, to, each, nation, state, which, also, in, a, fashion, the, roman, catholic, church, often, decried, angrily, preached, in, the, vulgar, or, native, language, of, each, region, these, ideas, did, not, spread, to, cultures, outside, of, europe, until, considerably, later, the, industrial, revolution, changed, societies, dramatically, as, a, consequence, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, became, the, first, theorists, of, socialism, and, communism, their, ideas, were, further, developed, by, vladimir, lenin, leading, to, the, ideology, of, leninism, under, joseph, stalin, these, ideas, would, be, further, developed, into, marxism, leninism, and, put, into, practice, in, the, soviet, union, and, later, the, eastern, bloc, during, the, cold, war, this, line, of, thought, would, further, result, in, maoism, ho, chi, minh, thought, hoxhaism, and, titoism, as, industrialisation, enabled, the, rise, of, colonialism, this, was, accompanied, by, the, ideology, of, imperialism, later, anti, imperialist, ideologies, would, counter, this, such, as, gandhism, and, nasserism
