god, schools, relations, with, the, tribunal, of, the, holy, office, of, the, inquisition, spanish, tribunal, del, santo, oficio, de, la, inquisici, n, commonly, known, as, the, spanish, inquisition, inquisici, n, espa, ola, was, established, in, 1478, by, the, catholic, monarchs, king, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, and, queen, isabella, i, of, castile, it, began, toward, the, end, of, the, reconquista, and, was, intended, to, maintain, catholic, orthodoxy, in, their, kingdoms, and, to, replace, the, medieval, inquisition, which, was, under, papal, control, it, became, the, most, substantive, of, the, three, different, manifestations, of, the, wider, catholic, inquisition, along, with, the, roman, inquisition, and, the, portuguese, inquisition, the, spanish, inquisition, may, be, defined, broadly, as, operating, in, spain, and, in, all, spanish, colonies, and, territories, which, included, the, canary, islands, the, kingdom, of, naples, and, all, spanish, possessions, in, north, america, and, south, america, according, to, some, modern, estimates, around, 150, 000, people, were, prosecuted, for, various, offences, during, the, three, century, duration, of, the, spanish, inquisition, of, whom, between, 3, 000, and, 5, 000, were, executed, approximately, 2, 7, percent, of, all, cases, the, inquisition, however, since, the, creation, of, the, american, courts, has, never, had, jurisdiction, over, the, indigenous, the, king, of, spain, ordered, that, the, inquisitors, should, never, proceed, against, the, indians, but, against, the, old, christians, and, their, descendants, and, other, persons, against, whom, in, these, kingdoms, of, spain, it, is, customary, to, proceed, the, inquisition, was, originally, intended, primarily, to, identify, heretics, among, those, who, converted, from, judaism, and, islam, to, catholicism, the, regulation, of, the, faith, of, newly, converted, catholics, was, intensified, following, royal, decrees, issued, in, 1492, and, 1502, ordering, jews, and, muslims, to, convert, to, catholicism, or, leave, castile, or, face, death, resulting, in, hundreds, of, thousands, of, forced, conversions, the, persecution, of, conversos, and, moriscos, and, the, mass, expulsions, of, jews, and, of, muslims, from, spain, the, inquisition, was, abolished, in, 1834, during, the, reign, of, isabella, ii, after, a, period, of, declining, influence, in, the, preceding, century, the, roman, emperor, constantine, legalized, christianity, in, 312, having, itself, been, severely, persecuted, under, previous, emperors, the, new, religion, now, felt, capable, of, commencing, its, own, program, of, persecutions, from, the, moment, it, was, recognised, and, empowered, there, were, persecutions, against, the, adherents, of, other, cults, pagans, jews, heretics, though, only, in, the, fourth, century, of, its, existence, christianity, had, spread, widely, and, was, already, beginning, to, experience, a, multiplicity, of, schisms, within, itself, among, the, most, significant, of, the, heresies, at, this, time, were, arianism, manichaeism, gnosticism, the, adamites, the, donatists, the, pelagians, and, priscillianists, the, edict, of, thessalonica, issued, on, 27, february, 380, by, emperor, theodosius, i, established, nicene, christianity, as, the, state, church, of, the, roman, empire, it, condemned, other, christian, creeds, as, heresies, of, foolish, madmen, and, approved, their, punishment, in, 438, under, emperor, theodosius, ii, the, codex, theodosianus, theodosian, code, a, compilation, of, laws, of, the, roman, empire, already, provided, for, the, confiscation, of, property, and, the, death, penalty, for, heretics, the, spanish, ascetic, and, theologian, priscillian, was, accused, of, magic, and, libertinage, and, excommunicated, in, 380, he, was, later, tried, and, executed, along, with, several, of, his, companions, by, emperor, magnus, maximus, at, the, instigation, of, two, christian, bishops, despite, the, opposition, of, important, figures, like, saint, martin, of, tours, and, saint, ambrose, priscillian, has, been, described, as, the, first, martyr, killed, by, a, spanish, inquisition, after, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, in, the, 5th, century, there, followed, a, period, of, almost, seven, centuries, in, which, persecutions, for, heresy, became, very, rare, some, of, the, old, heresies, survived, but, in, a, weakened, state, and, they, tended, not, to, operate, openly, no, new, schisms, appeared, to, emerge, during, this, period, the, episcopal, inquisition, was, created, through, papal, bull, ad, abolendam, to, abolish, at, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, by, pope, lucius, iii, with, the, support, of, emperor, frederick, i, to, combat, the, albigensian, heresy, in, southern, france, heretics, were, to, be, handed, over, to, secular, authorities, for, punishment, have, their, property, seized, and, face, excommunication, holders, of, public, office, counts, barons, rectors, in, cities, and, other, places, were, required, to, take, responsibility, for, punishing, heretics, handed, over, to, them, by, the, church, any, authority, who, failed, in, this, duty, would, be, excommunicated, removed, from, office, and, stripped, of, all, legal, rights, commercial, boycotts, would, be, imposed, on, cities, that, supported, heretics, and, declined, to, participate, it, was, the, start, of, a, centralization, process, in, the, fight, against, heresy, there, were, a, large, number, of, tribunals, of, the, papal, inquisition, in, various, european, kingdoms, during, the, middle, ages, in, the, kingdom, of, aragon, a, tribunal, of, the, papal, inquisition, was, established, by, the, statute, of, excommunicamus, et, anathematisamus, of, pope, gregory, ix, in, 1231, during, the, era, of, the, albigensian, heresy, as, a, condition, for, peace, with, aragon, the, inquisition, was, ill, received, by, the, aragonese, which, led, to, prohibitions, against, insults, or, attacks, on, it, rome, was, particularly, concerned, that, the, iberian, peninsula, s, large, muslim, and, jewish, population, would, have, a, heretical, influence, on, catholic, citizens, rome, pressed, the, kingdoms, to, accept, the, papal, inquisition, after, aragon, navarra, conceded, in, the, 13th, century, and, portugal, by, the, end, of, the, 14th, though, its, roman, inquisition, was, famously, inactive, castile, refused, steadily, trusting, in, its, prominent, position, in, europe, and, its, military, power, to, keep, the, pope, s, interventionism, in, check, by, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, england, due, to, distance, and, voluntary, compliance, and, castile, future, part, of, spain, due, to, resistance, and, power, were, the, only, western, european, kingdoms, to, successfully, resist, the, establishment, of, the, inquisition, in, their, realms, there, are, several, hypotheses, of, what, prompted, the, creation, of, the, tribunal, after, centuries, of, tolerance, within, the, context, of, medieval, europe, the, spanish, inquisition, is, interpretable, as, a, response, to, the, multi, religious, nature, of, spanish, society, following, the, reconquest, of, the, iberian, peninsula, from, the, muslim, moors, the, reconquista, did, not, result, in, the, total, expulsion, of, muslims, from, spain, since, they, along, with, jews, were, tolerated, by, the, ruling, christian, elite, large, cities, especially, seville, valladolid, and, barcelona, had, significant, jewish, populations, centered, on, juderia, but, in, the, coming, years, the, muslims, became, increasingly, alienated, and, relegated, from, power, centers, post, reconquest, medieval, spain, has, been, characterized, by, am, rico, castro, as, a, society, of, relatively, peaceful, co, existence, convivencia, punctuated, by, occasional, conflict, among, the, ruling, catholics, and, the, jews, and, muslims, as, historian, henry, kamen, notes, the, so, called, convivencia, was, always, a, relationship, between, unequals, despite, their, legal, inequality, there, was, a, long, tradition, of, jewish, service, to, the, crown, of, aragon, and, jews, occupied, many, important, posts, both, religious, and, political, castile, itself, had, an, unofficial, rabbi, ferdinand, s, father, john, ii, named, the, jewish, abiathar, crescas, court, astronomer, antisemitic, attitudes, increased, all, over, europe, during, the, late, 13th, century, and, throughout, the, 14th, century, england, and, france, expelled, their, jewish, populations, in, 1290, and, 1306, respectively, at, the, same, time, during, the, reconquista, spain, s, anti, jewish, sentiment, steadily, increased, this, prejudice, climaxed, in, the, summer, of, 1391, when, violent, anti, jewish, riots, broke, out, in, spanish, cities, like, barcelona, to, linguistically, distinguish, them, from, non, converted, or, long, established, catholic, families, new, converts, were, called, conversos, or, new, catholics, according, to, don, hasdai, crescas, persecution, against, jews, began, in, earnest, in, seville, in, 1391, on, the, 1st, day, of, the, lunar, month, tammuz, june, from, there, the, violence, spread, to, c, rdoba, and, by, the, 17th, day, of, the, same, lunar, month, it, had, reached, toledo, called, then, by, jews, after, its, arabic, name, ulay, ulah, in, the, region, of, castile, then, the, violence, spread, to, mallorca, and, by, the, 1st, day, of, the, lunar, month, elul, it, had, also, reached, the, jews, of, barcelona, in, catalonia, where, the, slain, were, estimated, at, two, hundred, and, fifty, indeed, many, jews, who, resided, in, the, neighboring, provinces, of, lleida, and, gironda, and, in, the, kingdom, of, valencia, had, also, been, affected, as, were, also, the, jews, of, al, andalus, andaluc, a, while, many, died, a, martyr, s, death, others, converted, to, save, themselves, encouraged, by, the, preaching, of, ferrand, mart, nez, archdeacon, of, ecija, the, general, unrest, affected, nearly, all, of, the, jews, in, spain, during, which, time, an, estimated, 200, 000, jews, changed, their, religion, or, else, concealed, their, religion, becoming, known, in, hebrew, as, anusim, meaning, those, who, are, compelled, only, a, handful, of, the, more, principal, persons, of, the, jewish, community, those, who, had, found, refuge, among, the, viceroys, in, the, outlying, towns, and, districts, managed, to, escape, forced, baptism, was, contrary, to, the, law, of, the, catholic, church, and, theoretically, anybody, who, had, been, forcibly, baptized, could, legally, return, to, judaism, legal, definitions, of, the, time, theoretically, acknowledged, that, a, forced, baptism, was, not, a, valid, sacrament, but, confined, this, to, cases, where, it, was, literally, administered, by, physical, force, a, person, who, had, consented, to, baptism, under, threat, of, death, or, serious, injury, was, still, regarded, as, a, voluntary, convert, and, accordingly, forbidden, to, revert, to, judaism, after, the, public, violence, many, of, the, converted, felt, it, safer, to, remain, in, their, new, religion, thus, after, 1391, a, new, social, group, appeared, and, were, referred, to, as, conversos, or, new, christians, many, conversos, now, freed, from, the, anti, semitic, restrictions, imposed, on, jewish, employment, attained, important, positions, in, fifteenth, century, spain, including, positions, in, the, government, and, in, the, church, among, many, others, physicians, andr, s, laguna, and, francisco, l, pez, de, villalobos, ferdinand, s, court, physician, writers, juan, del, enzina, juan, de, mena, diego, de, valera, and, alonso, de, palencia, and, bankers, luis, de, sant, ngel, and, gabriel, s, nchez, who, financed, the, voyage, of, christopher, columbus, were, all, conversos, conversos, not, without, opposition, managed, to, attain, high, positions, in, the, ecclesiastical, hierarchy, at, times, becoming, severe, detractors, of, judaism, some, even, received, titles, of, nobility, and, as, a, result, during, the, following, century, some, works, attempted, to, demonstrate, many, nobles, of, spain, were, descended, from, israelites, according, to, this, hypothesis, the, inquisition, was, created, to, standardize, the, variety, of, laws, and, many, jurisdictions, spain, was, divided, into, it, would, be, an, administrative, program, analogous, to, the, santa, hermandad, the, holy, brotherhood, a, law, enforcement, body, answering, to, the, crown, that, prosecuted, thieves, and, criminals, across, counties, in, a, way, local, county, authorities, could, not, ancestor, to, the, guardia, civil, an, institution, that, would, guarantee, uniform, prosecution, of, crimes, against, royal, laws, across, all, local, jurisdictions, the, kingdom, of, castile, had, been, prosperous, and, successful, in, europe, thanks, in, part, to, the, unusual, authority, and, control, the, king, exerted, over, the, nobility, which, ensured, political, stability, and, kept, the, kingdom, from, being, weakened, by, in, fighting, as, was, the, case, in, england, for, example, under, the, trast, mara, dynasty, both, kings, of, castile, and, aragon, had, lost, power, to, the, great, nobles, who, now, formed, dissenting, and, conspiratorial, factions, taxation, and, varying, privileges, differed, from, county, to, county, and, powerful, noble, families, constantly, extorted, the, kings, to, attain, further, concessions, particularly, in, aragon, the, main, goals, of, the, reign, of, the, catholic, monarchs, were, to, unite, their, two, kingdoms, and, strengthen, royal, influence, to, guarantee, stability, in, pursuit, of, this, they, sought, to, further, unify, the, laws, of, their, realms, and, reduce, the, power, of, the, nobility, in, certain, local, areas, they, attained, this, partially, by, raw, military, strength, by, creating, a, combined, army, between, the, two, of, them, that, could, outmatch, the, army, of, most, noble, coalitions, in, the, peninsula, it, was, impossible, to, change, the, entire, laws, of, both, realms, by, force, alone, and, due, to, reasonable, suspicion, of, one, another, the, monarchs, kept, their, kingdoms, separate, during, their, lifetimes, the, only, way, to, unify, both, kingdoms, and, ensure, that, isabella, ferdinand, and, their, descendants, maintained, the, power, of, both, kingdoms, without, uniting, them, in, life, was, to, find, or, create, an, executive, legislative, and, judicial, arm, directly, under, the, crown, empowered, to, act, in, both, kingdoms, this, goal, the, hypothesis, goes, might, have, given, birth, to, the, spanish, inquisition, the, religious, organization, to, oversee, this, role, was, obvious, catholicism, was, the, only, institution, common, to, both, kingdoms, and, the, only, one, with, enough, popular, support, that, the, nobility, could, not, easily, attack, it, through, the, spanish, inquisition, isabella, and, ferdinand, created, a, personal, police, force, and, personal, code, of, law, that, rested, above, the, structure, of, their, respective, realms, without, altering, or, mixing, them, and, could, operate, freely, in, both, as, the, inquisition, had, the, backing, of, both, kingdoms, it, would, exist, independent, of, both, the, nobility, and, local, interests, of, either, kingdom, according, to, this, view, the, prosecution, of, heretics, would, be, secondary, or, simply, not, considered, different, from, the, prosecution, of, conspirators, traitors, or, groups, of, any, kind, who, planned, to, resist, royal, authority, at, the, time, royal, authority, rested, on, divine, right, and, on, oaths, of, loyalty, held, before, god, so, the, connection, between, religious, deviation, and, political, disloyalty, would, appear, obvious, this, hypothesis, is, supported, by, the, disproportionately, high, representation, of, the, nobility, and, high, clergy, among, those, investigated, by, the, inquisition, as, well, as, by, the, many, administrative, and, civil, crimes, the, inquisition, oversaw, the, inquisition, prosecuted, the, counterfeiting, of, royal, seals, and, currency, ensured, the, effective, transmission, of, the, orders, of, the, kings, and, verified, the, authenticity, of, official, documents, traveling, through, the, kingdoms, especially, from, one, kingdom, to, the, other, see, non, religious, crimes, at, a, time, when, most, of, europe, had, already, expelled, the, jews, from, the, christian, kingdoms, the, dirty, blood, of, spaniards, was, met, with, open, suspicion, and, contempt, by, the, rest, of, europe, as, the, world, became, smaller, and, foreign, relations, became, more, relevant, to, stay, in, power, this, foreign, image, of, being, the, seed, of, jews, and, moors, may, have, become, a, problem, in, addition, the, coup, that, allowed, isabella, to, take, the, throne, from, joanna, of, castile, la, beltraneja, and, the, catholic, monarchs, to, marry, had, estranged, castile, from, portugal, its, historical, ally, and, created, the, need, for, new, relationships, similarly, aragon, s, ambitions, lay, in, control, of, the, mediterranean, and, the, defense, against, france, as, their, policy, of, royal, marriages, proved, the, catholic, monarchs, were, deeply, concerned, about, france, s, growing, power, and, expected, to, create, strong, dynastic, alliances, across, europe, in, this, scenario, the, iberian, reputation, of, being, too, tolerant, was, a, problem, despite, the, prestige, earned, through, the, reconquest, reconquista, the, foreign, image, of, spaniards, coexisted, with, an, almost, universal, image, of, heretics, and, bad, christians, due, to, the, long, coexistence, between, the, three, religions, they, had, accepted, in, their, lands, anti, jewish, stereotypes, created, to, justify, or, prompt, the, expulsion, and, expropriation, of, the, european, jews, were, also, applied, to, spaniards, in, most, european, courts, and, the, idea, of, them, being, greedy, gold, thirsty, cruel, and, violent, due, to, the, jewish, and, moorish, blood, was, prevalent, in, europe, before, america, was, discovered, by, europeans, chronicles, by, foreign, travelers, circulated, through, europe, describing, the, tolerant, ambiance, reigning, in, the, court, of, isabella, and, ferdinand, and, how, moors, and, jews, were, free, to, go, about, without, anyone, trying, to, convert, them, past, and, common, clashes, between, the, pope, and, the, kingdoms, of, the, iberian, peninsula, regarding, the, inquisition, in, castile, s, case, and, regarding, south, italy, in, aragon, s, case, also, reinforced, their, image, of, heretics, in, the, international, courts, these, accusations, and, images, could, have, direct, political, and, military, consequences, at, the, time, especially, considering, that, the, union, of, two, powerful, kingdoms, was, a, particularly, delicate, moment, that, could, prompt, the, fear, and, violent, reactions, from, neighbors, even, more, if, combined, with, the, expansion, of, the, ottoman, turks, on, the, mediterranean, the, creation, of, the, inquisition, and, the, expulsion, of, both, jews, and, moriscos, may, have, been, part, of, a, strategy, to, whitewash, the, image, of, spain, and, ease, international, fears, regarding, spain, s, allegiance, in, this, scenario, the, creation, of, the, inquisition, could, have, been, part, of, the, catholic, monarchs, strategy, to, turn, away, from, african, allies, and, towards, europe, a, tool, to, turn, both, actual, spain, and, the, spanish, image, more, european, and, improve, relations, with, the, pope, the, alleged, discovery, of, morisco, plots, to, support, a, possible, ottoman, invasion, were, crucial, factors, in, their, decision, to, create, the, inquisition, at, this, time, the, ottoman, empire, was, in, rapid, expansion, and, the, aragonese, mediterranean, empire, was, crumbling, under, debt, and, war, exhaustion, ferdinand, reasonably, feared, that, he, would, not, be, capable, of, repelling, an, ottoman, attack, to, spain, s, shores, especially, if, the, ottomans, had, internal, help, the, regions, with, the, highest, concentration, of, moriscos, were, those, close, to, the, common, naval, crossings, between, spain, and, africa, if, the, weakness, of, the, aragonese, naval, empire, was, combined, with, the, resentment, of, the, higher, nobility, against, the, monarchs, the, dynastic, claims, of, portugal, on, castile, and, the, two, monarchs, exterior, politics, that, turned, away, from, morocco, and, other, african, nations, in, favor, of, europe, the, fear, of, a, second, muslim, invasion, and, thus, a, second, muslim, occupation, was, hardly, unfounded, this, fear, may, have, been, the, base, reason, for, the, expulsion, of, those, citizens, who, had, either, a, religious, reason, to, support, the, invasion, of, the, ottomans, moriscos, or, no, particular, religious, reason, to, not, do, it, jews, the, inquisition, might, have, been, part, of, the, preparations, to, enforce, these, measures, and, ensure, their, effectiveness, by, rooting, out, false, converts, that, would, still, pose, a, threat, of, foreign, espionage, in, favor, of, this, view, there, is, the, obvious, military, sense, it, makes, and, the, many, early, attempts, of, peaceful, conversion, and, persuasion, that, the, monarchs, used, at, the, beginning, of, their, reign, and, the, sudden, turn, towards, the, creation, of, the, inquisition, and, the, edicts, of, expulsion, when, those, initial, attempts, failed, the, conquest, of, naples, by, the, gran, capitan, is, also, proof, of, an, interest, in, mediterranean, expansion, and, re, establishment, of, spanish, power, in, that, sea, that, was, bound, to, generate, frictions, with, the, ottoman, empire, and, other, african, nations, so, the, inquisition, would, have, been, created, as, a, permanent, body, to, prevent, the, existence, of, citizens, with, religious, sympathies, with, african, nations, now, that, rivalry, with, them, had, been, deemed, unavoidable, the, creation, of, the, spanish, inquisition, was, consistent, with, the, most, important, political, philosophers, of, the, florentine, school, with, whom, the, kings, were, known, to, have, contact, guicciardini, pico, della, mirandola, machiavelli, segni, pitti, nardi, varchi, etc, both, guicciardini, and, machiavelli, defended, the, importance, of, centralization, and, unification, to, create, a, strong, state, capable, of, repelling, foreign, invasions, and, also, warned, of, the, dangers, of, excessive, social, uniformity, to, the, creativity, and, innovation, of, a, nation, machiavelli, considered, piety, and, morals, desirable, for, the, subjects, but, not, so, much, for, the, ruler, who, should, use, them, as, a, way, to, unify, its, population, he, also, warned, of, the, nefarious, influence, of, a, corrupt, church, in, the, creation, of, a, selfish, population, and, middle, nobility, which, had, fragmented, the, peninsula, and, made, it, unable, to, resist, either, france, or, aragon, german, philosophers, at, the, time, were, spreading, the, importance, of, a, vassal, sharing, the, religion, of, their, lord, the, inquisition, may, have, just, been, the, result, of, putting, these, ideas, into, practice, the, use, of, religion, as, a, unifying, factor, across, a, land, that, was, allowed, to, stay, diverse, and, maintain, different, laws, in, other, respects, and, the, creation, of, the, inquisition, to, enforce, laws, across, it, maintain, said, religious, unity, and, control, the, local, elites, were, consistent, with, most, of, those, teachings, alternatively, the, enforcement, of, catholicism, across, the, realm, might, indeed, be, the, result, of, simple, religious, devotion, by, the, monarchs, the, recent, scholarship, on, the, expulsion, of, the, jews, leans, towards, the, belief, of, religious, motivations, being, at, the, bottom, of, it, but, considering, the, reports, on, ferdinand, s, political, persona, that, is, unlikely, the, only, reason, ferdinand, was, described, among, others, by, machiavelli, as, a, man, who, didn, t, know, the, meaning, of, piety, but, who, made, political, use, of, it, and, would, have, achieved, little, if, he, had, really, known, it, he, was, machiavelli, s, main, inspiration, while, writing, the, prince, the, hierarchy, of, the, catholic, church, had, made, many, attempts, during, the, middle, ages, to, take, over, christian, spain, politically, such, as, claiming, the, church, s, ownership, over, all, land, reconquered, from, non, christians, a, claim, that, was, rejected, by, castile, but, accepted, by, aragon, and, portugal, in, the, past, the, papacy, had, tried, and, partially, succeeded, in, forcing, the, mozarabic, rite, out, of, iberia, its, intervention, had, been, pivotal, for, aragon, s, loss, of, rosellon, the, meddling, regarding, aragon, s, control, over, south, italy, was, even, stronger, historically, in, their, lifetime, the, catholic, monarchs, had, problems, with, pope, paul, ii, a, very, strong, proponent, of, absolute, authority, for, the, church, over, the, kings, carrillo, actively, opposed, them, both, and, often, used, spain, s, mixed, blood, as, an, excuse, to, intervene, the, papacy, and, the, monarchs, of, europe, had, been, involved, in, a, rivalry, for, power, all, through, the, high, middle, ages, that, rome, had, already, won, in, other, powerful, kingdoms, like, france, since, the, legitimacy, granted, by, the, church, was, necessary, for, both, monarchs, especially, isabella, to, stay, in, power, the, creation, of, the, spanish, inquisition, may, have, been, a, way, to, apparently, concede, to, the, pope, s, demands, and, criticism, regarding, spain, s, mixed, religious, heritage, while, at, the, same, time, ensuring, that, the, pope, could, hardly, force, the, second, inquisition, of, his, own, and, at, the, same, time, create, a, tool, to, control, the, power, of, the, roman, church, in, spain, the, spanish, inquisition, was, unique, at, the, time, because, it,

intervention, the, inquisition, was, despite, its, title, of, holy, not, necessarily, formed, by, the, clergy, and, secular, lawyers, were, equally, welcome, to, it, if, it, was, an, attempt, at, keeping, rome, out, of, spain, it, was, an, extremely, successful, and, refined, one, it, was, a, bureaucratic, body, that, had, the, nominal, authority, of, the, church, and, permission, to, prosecute, members, of, the, church, which, the, kings, could, not, do, while, answering, only, to, the, spanish, crown, this, did, not, prevent, the, pope, from, having, some, influence, on, the, decisions, of, spanish, monarchs, but, it, did, force, the, influence, to, be, through, the, kings, making, direct, influence, very, difficult, other, hypotheses, that, circulate, regarding, the, spanish, inquisition, s, creation, include, fray, alonso, de, ojeda, a, dominican, friar, from, seville, convinced, queen, isabella, of, the, existence, of, crypto, judaism, among, andalusian, conversos, during, her, stay, in, seville, between, 1477, and, 1478, a, report, produced, by, pedro, gonz, lez, de, mendoza, archbishop, of, seville, and, by, the, segovian, dominican, tom, s, de, torquemada, of, converso, family, himself, corroborated, this, assertion, spanish, monarchs, ferdinand, and, isabella, requested, a, papal, bull, establishing, an, inquisition, in, spain, in, 1478, pope, sixtus, iv, granted, the, bull, exigit, sincerae, devotionis, affectus, permitting, the, monarchs, to, select, and, appoint, two, or, three, priests, over, forty, years, of, age, to, act, as, inquisitors, in, 1483, ferdinand, and, isabella, established, a, state, council, to, administer, the, inquisition, with, the, dominican, friar, tom, s, de, torquemada, acting, as, its, president, even, though, sixtus, iv, protested, the, activities, of, the, inquisition, in, aragon, and, its, treatment, of, the, conversos, torquemada, eventually, assumed, the, title, of, inquisitor, general, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, pressured, pope, sixtus, iv, to, agree, to, an, inquisition, controlled, by, the, monarchy, by, threatening, to, withdraw, military, support, at, a, time, when, the, turks, were, a, threat, to, rome, the, pope, issued, a, bull, to, stop, the, inquisition, but, was, pressured, into, withdrawing, it, on, 1, november, 1478, sixtus, published, the, papal, bull, exigit, sincerae, devotionis, affectus, sincere, devotion, is, required, through, which, he, gave, the, monarchs, exclusive, authority, to, name, the, inquisitors, in, their, kingdoms, the, first, two, inquisitors, miguel, de, morillo, and, juan, de, san, mart, n, were, not, named, until, two, years, later, on, 27, september, 1480, in, medina, del, campo, the, first, auto, de, f, was, held, in,

cities, vila, c, rdoba, ja, n, medina, del, campo, segovia, sig, enza, toledo, and, valladolid, sixtus, iv, promulgated, a, new, bull, 1482, categorically, prohibiting, the, inquisition, s, extension, to, arag, n, affirming, that, in, aragon, valencia, mallorca, and, catalonia, the, inquisition, has, for, some, time, been, moved, not, by, zeal, for, the, faith, and, the, salvation, of, souls, but, by, lust, for, wealth, and, that, many, true, and, faithful, christians, on, the, testimony, of, enemies, rivals, slaves, and, other, lower, and, even, less, proper, persons, have, without, any, legitimate, proof, been, thrust, into, secular, prisons, tortured, and, condemned, as, relapsed, heretics, deprived, of, their, goods, and, property, and, handed, over, to, the, secular, arm, to, be, executed, to, the, peril, of, souls, setting, a, pernicious, example, and, causing, disgust, to, many, outraged, ferdinand, feigned, doubt, about, the, bull, s, veracity, arguing, that, no, sensible, pope, would, have, published, such, a, document, he, wrote, the, pope, on, may, 13, 1482, saying, take, care, therefore, not, to, let, the, matter, go, further, and, to, revoke, any, concessions, and, entrust, us, with, the, care, of, this, question, according, to, the, book, a, history, of, the, jewish, people, in, 1482, the, pope, was, still, trying, to, maintain, control, over, the, inquisition, and, to, gain, acceptance, for, his, own, attitude, towards, the, new, christians, which, was, generally, more, moderate, than, that, of, the, inquisition, and, the, local, rulers, in, 1483, jews, were, expelled, from, all, of, andalusia, though, the, pope, wanted, to, crack, down, on, abuses, ferdinand, pressured, him, to, promulgate, a, new, bull, threatening, that, he, would, otherwise, separate, the, inquisition, from, church, authority, sixtus, did, so, on, 17, october, 1483, naming, tom, s, de, torquemada, inquisidor, general, of, arag, n, valencia, and, catalonia, torquemada, quickly, established, procedures, for, the, inquisition, in, 1484, based, in, nicholas, eymerich, s, directorium, inquisitorum, he, created, a, twenty, eight, article, inquisitor, s, code, compilaci, n, de, las, instrucciones, del, oficio, de, la, santa, inquisici, n, i, e, compilation, of, the, instructions, of, the, office, of, the, holy, inquisition, essentially, unaltered, for, more, than, three, centuries, following, torquemada, s, death, a, new, court, would, be, announced, with, a, thirty, day, grace, period, for, self, confessions, and, denunciations, and, the, gathering, of, accusations, by, neighbors, and, acquaintances, evidence, that, was, used, to, identify, a, crypto, jew, included, the, absence, of, chimney, smoke, on, saturdays, a, sign, the, family, might, secretly, be, honoring, the, sabbath, the, buying, of, many, vegetables, before, passover, or, the, purchase, of, meat, from, a, converted, butcher, the, court, could, employ, physical, torture, to, extract, confessions, crypto, jews, were, allowed, to, confess, and, do, penance, although, those, who, relapsed, were, executed, in, 1484, pope, innocent, viii, attempted, to, allow, appeals, to, rome, against, the, inquisition, which, would, weaken, the, function, of, the, institution, as, protection, against, the, pope, but, ferdinand, in, december, 1484, and, again, in, 1509, decreed, death, and, confiscation, for, anyone, trying, to, make, use, of, such, procedures, without, royal, permission, with, this, the, inquisition, became, the, only, institution, that, held, authority, across, all, the, realms, of, the, spanish, monarchy, and, in, all, of, them, a, useful, mechanism, at, the, service, of, the, crown, the, cities, of, arag, n, continued, resisting, and, even, saw, revolt, as, in, teruel, from, 1484, to, 1485, the, murder, of, inquisidor, pedro, arbu, s, later, made, saint, in, zaragoza, on, 15, september, 1485, caused, public, opinion, to, turn, against, the, conversos, and, in, favour, of, the, inquisition, in, arag, n, the, inquisitorial, courts, were, focused, specifically, on, members, of, the, powerful, converso, minority, ending, their, influence, in, the, aragonese, administration, the, inquisition, was, extremely, active, between, 1480, and, 1530, different, sources, give, different, estimates, of, the, number, of, trials, and, executions, in, this, period, some, estimate, about, 2, 000, executions, based, on, the, documentation, of, the, autos, de, f, the, great, majority, being, conversos, of, jewish, origin, he, offers, striking, statistics, 91, 6, of, those, judged, in, valencia, between, 1484, and, 1530, and, 99, 3, of, those, judged, in, barcelona, between, 1484, and, 1505, were, of, jewish, origin, the, inquisition, had, jurisdiction, only, over, christians, it, had, no, power, to, investigate, prosecute, or, convict, jews, muslims, or, any, open, member, of, other, religions, anyone, who, was, known, to, identify, as, either, jew, or, muslim, was, outside, of, inquisitorial, jurisdiction, and, could, be, tried, only, by, the, king, all, the, inquisition, could, do, in, some, of, those, cases, was, to, deport, the, individual, according, to, the, king, s, law, but, usually, even, that, had, to, go, through, a, civil, tribunal, the, inquisition, had, the, authority, to, try, only, those, who, self, identified, as, christians, initially, for, taxation, purposes, later, to, avoid, deportation, as, well, while, practicing, another, religion, de, facto, even, those, were, treated, as, christians, if, they, confessed, or, identified, not, as, judeizantes, but, as, fully, practicing, jews, they, fell, back, into, the, previously, explained, category, and, could, not, be, targeted, although, they, would, have, pleaded, guilty, to, previously, lying, about, being, christian, though, not, subject, to, the, inquisition, jews, who, refused, to, convert, or, leave, spain, were, called, heretics, and, could, be, burned, to, death, on, a, stake, the, spanish, inquisition, had, been, established, in, part, to, prevent, conversos, from, engaging, in, jewish, practices, which, as, christians, they, were, supposed, to, have, given, up, this, remedy, for, securing, the, orthodoxy, of, conversos, was, eventually, deemed, inadequate, since, the, main, justification, the, monarchy, gave, for, formally, expelling, all, jews, from, spain, was, the, great, harm, suffered, by, christians, i, e, conversos, from, the, contact, intercourse, and, communication, which, they, have, with, the, jews, who, always, attempt, in, various, ways, to, seduce, faithful, christians, from, our, holy, catholic, faith, according, to, the, 1492, edict, the, alhambra, decree, issued, in, january, 1492, gave, the, choice, between, expulsion, conversion, or, death, it, was, among, the, few, expulsion, orders, that, allowed, conversion, as, an, alternative, and, is, used, as, a, proof, of, the, religious, not, racial, element, of, the, measure, the, enforcement, of, this, decree, was, very, unequal, with, the, focus, mainly, on, coastal, and, southern, regions, those, at, risk, of, ottoman, invasion, and, more, gradual, and, ineffective, enforcement, towards, the, interior, historic, accounts, of, the, numbers, of, jews, who, left, spain, were, based, on, speculation, and, some, aspects, were, exaggerated, by, early, accounts, and, historians, juan, de, mariana, speaks, of, 800, 000, people, and, don, isaac, abravanel, of, 300, 000, while, few, reliable, statistics, exist, for, the, expulsion, modern, estimates, based, on, tax, returns, and, population, estimates, of, communities, are, much, lower, with, kamen, stating, that, of, a, population, of, approximately, 80, 000, jews, and, 200, 000, conversos, about, 40, 000, emigrated, the, jews, of, the, kingdom, of, castile, emigrated, mainly, to, portugal, where, the, entire, community, was, forcibly, converted, in, 1497, and, to, north, africa, the, jews, of, the, kingdom, of, aragon, fled, to, other, christian, areas, including, italy, rather, than, to, muslim, lands, as, is, often, assumed, although, the, vast, majority, of, conversos, simply, assimilated, into, the, catholic, dominant, culture, a, minority, continued, to, practice, judaism, in, secret, gradually, migrated, throughout, europe, north, africa, and, the, ottoman, empire, mainly, to, areas, where, sephardic, communities, were, already, present, as, a, result, of, the, alhambra, decree, the, most, intense, period, of, persecution, of, conversos, lasted, until, 1530, from, 1531, to, 1560, the, percentage, of, conversos, among, the, inquisition, trials, dropped, to, 3, of, the, total, there, was, a, rebound, of, persecutions, when, a, group, of, crypto, jews, was, discovered, in, quintanar, de, la, orden, in, 1588, and, there, was, a, rise, in, denunciations, of, conversos, in, the, last, decade, of, the, sixteenth, century, at, the, beginning, of, the, seventeenth, century, some, conversos, who, had, fled, to, portugal, began, to, return, to, spain, fleeing, the, persecution, of, the, portuguese, inquisition, founded, in, 1536, this, led, to, a, rapid, increase, in, the, trials, of, crypto, jews, among, them, a, number, of, important, financiers, in, 1691, during, a, number, of, autos, de, f, in, majorca, 37, chuetas, or, conversos, of, majorca, were, burned, during, the, eighteenth, century, the, number, of, conversos, accused, by, the, inquisition, decreased, significantly, manuel, santiago, vivar, tried, in, c, rdoba, in, 1818, was, the, last, person, tried, for, being, a, crypto, jew, the, inquisition, searched, for, false, or, relapsed, converts, among, the, moriscos, who, had, converted, from, islam, beginning, with, a, decree, on, 14, february, 1502, muslims, in, granada, had, to, choose, between, conversion, to, christianity, or, expulsion, in, the, crown, of, aragon, most, muslims, faced, this, choice, after, the, revolt, of, the, brotherhoods, 1519, 1523, the, enforcement, of, the, expulsion, of, the, moriscos, was, implemented, unevenly, especially, in, the, lands, of, the, interior, and, the, north, in, these, regions, coexistence, had, lasted, for, over, five, centuries, and, moriscos, were, protected, by, the, population, in, many, cases, expulsion, orders, were, partially, or, completely, ignored, the, war, of, the, alpujarras, 1568, 71, a, general, muslim, morisco, uprising, in, granada, that, expected, to, aid, ottoman, disembarkation, in, the, peninsula, ended, in, a, forced, dispersal, of, about, half, of, the, region, s, moriscos, throughout, castile, and, andalusia, as, well, as, increased, suspicions, by, spanish, authorities, against, this, community, many, moriscos, were, suspected, of, practising, islam, in, secret, and, the, jealousy, with, which, they, guarded, the, privacy, of, their, domestic, life, prevented, the, verification, of, this, suspicion, initially, they, were, not, severely, persecuted, by, the, inquisition, experiencing, instead, a, policy, of, evangelization, a, policy, not, followed, with, those, conversos, who, were, suspected, of, being, crypto, jews, there, were, various, reasons, for, this, in, the, kingdoms, of, valencia, and, aragon, a, large, number, of, the, moriscos, were, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, nobility, and, persecution, would, have, been, viewed, as, a, frontal, assault, on, the, economic, interests, of, this, powerful, social, class, most, importantly, the, moriscos, had, integrated, into, the, spanish, society, significantly, better, than, the, jews, intermarrying, with, the, population, often, and, were, not, seen, as, a, foreign, element, especially, in, rural, areas, still, fears, ran, high, among, the, population, that, the, moriscos, were, traitorous, especially, in, granada, the, coast, was, regularly, raided, by, barbary, pirates, backed, by, spain, s, enemy, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, moriscos, were, suspected, of, aiding, them, in, the, second, half, of, the, century, late, in, the, reign, of, philip, ii, conditions, worsened, between, old, christians, and, moriscos, the, morisco, revolt, in, granada, in, 1568, 1570, was, harshly, suppressed, and, the, inquisition, intensified, its, attention, on, the, moriscos, from, 1570, morisco, cases, became, predominant, in, the, tribunals, of, zaragoza, valencia, and, granada, in, the, tribunal, of, granada, between, 1560, and, 1571, 82, of, those, accused, were, moriscos, who, were, a, vast, majority, of, the, kingdom, s, population, at, the, time, still, the, moriscos, did, not, experience, the, same, harshness, as, judaizing, conversos, and, protestants, and, the, number, of, capital, punishments, was, proportionally, less, in, 1609, king, philip, iii, upon, the, advice, of, his, financial, adviser, the, duke, of, lerma, and, archbishop, of, valencia, juan, de, ribera, decreed, the, expulsion, of, the, moriscos, hundreds, of, thousands, of, moriscos, were, expelled, this, was, further, fueled, by, the, religious, intolerance, of, archbishop, ribera, who, quoted, the, old, testament, texts, ordering, the, enemies, of, god, to, be, slain, without, mercy, and, setting, forth, the, duties, of, kings, to, extirpate, them, the, edict, required, the, moriscos, to, depart, under, the, pain, of, death, and, confiscation, without, trial, or, sentence, to, take, with, them, no, money, bullion, jewels, or, bills, of, exchange, just, what, they, could, carry, although, initial, estimates, of, the, number, expelled, such, as, those, of, henri, lapeyre, reach, 300, 000, moriscos, or, 4, of, the, total, spanish, population, the, extent, and, severity, of, the, expulsion, in, much, of, spain, has, been, increasingly, challenged, by, modern, historians, such, as, trevor, j, dadson, nevertheless, the, eastern, region, of, valencia, where, ethnic, tensions, were, high, was, particularly, affected, by, the, expulsion, suffering, economic, collapse, and, depopulation, of, much, of, its, territory, of, those, permanently, expelled, the, majority, finally, settled, in, the, maghreb, or, the, barbary, coast, those, who, avoided, expulsion, or, who, managed, to, return, were, gradually, absorbed, by, the, dominant, culture, the, inquisition, pursued, some, trials, against, moriscos, who, remained, or, returned, after, expulsion, at, the, height, of, the, inquisition, cases, against, moriscos, are, estimated, to, have, constituted, less, than, 10, percent, of, those, judged, by, the, inquisition, upon, the, coronation, of, philip, iv, in, 1621, the, new, king, gave, the, order, to, desist, from, attempting, to, impose, measures, on, remaining, moriscos, and, returnees, in, september, 1628, the, council, of, the, supreme, inquisition, ordered, inquisitors, in, seville, not, to, prosecute, expelled, moriscos, unless, they, cause, significant, commotion, the, last, mass, prosecution, against, moriscos, for, crypto, islamic, practices, occurred, in, granada, in, 1727, with, most, of, those, convicted, receiving, relatively, light, sentences, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, indigenous, practice, of, islam, is, considered, to, have, been, effectively, extinguished, in, spain, despite, popular, myths, about, the, spanish, inquisition, relating, to, protestants, it, dealt, with, very, few, cases, involving, actual, protestants, as, there, were, so, few, in, spain, lutheran, was, a, portmanteau, accusation, used, by, the, inquisition, to, act, against, all, those, who, acted, in, a, way, that, was, offensive, to, the, church, the, first, of, the, trials, against, those, labeled, by, the, inquisition, as, lutheran, were, those, against, the, sect, of, mystics, known, as, the, alumbrados, of, guadalajara, and, valladolid, the, trials, were, long, and, ended, with, prison, sentences, of, differing, lengths, though, none, of, the, sect, were, executed, nevertheless, the, subject, of, the, alumbrados, put, the, inquisition, on, the, trail, of, many, intellectuals, and, clerics, who, interested, in, erasmian, ideas, had, strayed, from, orthodoxy, this, is, striking, because, both, charles, i, and, philip, ii, were, confessed, admirers, of, erasmus, the, first, trials, against, lutheran, groups, as, such, took, place, between, 1558, and, 1562, at, the, beginning, of, the, reign, of, philip, ii, against, two, communities, of, protestants, from, the, cities, of, valladolid, and, seville, numbering, about, 120, the, trials, signaled, a, notable, intensification, of, the, inquisition, s, activities, a, number, of, autos, de, f, were, held, some, of, them, presided, over, by, members, of, the, royal, family, and, around, 100, executions, took, place, the, autos, de, f, of, the, mid, century, virtually, put, an, end, to, spanish, protestantism, which, was, throughout, a, small, phenomenon, to, begin, with, after, 1562, though, the, trials, continued, the, repression, was, much, reduced, about, 200, spaniards, were, accused, of, being, protestants, in, the, last, decades, of, the, 16th, century, most, of, them, were, in, no, sense, protestants, irreligious, sentiments, drunken, mockery, anticlerical, expressions, were, all, captiously, classified, by, the, inquisitors, or, by, those, who, denounced, the, cases, as, lutheran, disrespect, to, church, images, and, eating, meat, on, forbidden, days, were, taken, as, signs, of, heresy, it, is, estimated, that, a, dozen, protestant, spaniards, were, burned, alive, in, the, later, part, of, the, sixteenth, century, protestantism, was, treated, as, a, marker, to, identify, agents, of, foreign, powers, and, symptoms, of, political, disloyalty, as, much, as, if, not, more, than, a, cause, of, prosecution, in, itself, even, though, the, inquisition, had, theoretical, permission, to, investigate, orthodox, heretics, it, almost, never, did, there, was, no, major, war, between, spain, and, any, orthodox, nation, so, there, was, no, reason, to, do, so, there, was, one, casualty, tortured, by, those, jesuits, though, most, likely, franciscans, who, administered, the, spanish, inquisition, in, north, america, according, to, authorities, within, the, eastern, orthodox, church, st, peter, the, aleut, even, that, single, report, has, various, numbers, of, inaccuracies, that, make, it, problematic, and, has, no, confirmation, in, the, inquisitorial, archives, the, category, superstitions, includes, trials, related, to, witchcraft, the, witch, hunt, in, spain, had, much, less, intensity, than, in, other, european, countries, particularly, france, scotland, and, germany, one, remarkable, case, was, that, of, logro, o, in, which, the, witches, of, zugarramurdi, in, navarre, were, persecuted, during, the, auto, de, f, that, took, place, in, logro, o, on, 7, and, 8, november, 1610, six, people, were, burned, and, another, five, burned, in, effigy, the, role, of, the, inquisition, in, cases, of, witchcraft, was, much, more, restricted, than, is, commonly, believed, well, after, the, foundation, of, the, inquisition, jurisdiction, over, sorcery, and, witchcraft, remained, in, secular, hands, in, general, the, spanish, inquisition, maintained, a, skeptical, attitude, towards, cases, of, witchcraft, considering, it, as, a, mere, superstition, without, any, basis, alonso, de, salazar, fr, as, who, took, the, edict, of, faith, to, various, parts, of, navarre, after, the, trials, of, logro, o, noted, in, his, report, to, the, suprema, that, there, were, neither, witches, nor, bewitched, in, a, village, until, they, were, talked, and, written, about, included, under, the, rubric, of, heretical, propositions, were, verbal, offences, from, outright, blasphemy, to, questionable, statements, regarding, religious, beliefs, from, issues, of, sexual, morality, to, misbehaviour, of, the, clergy, many, were, brought, to, trial, for, affirming, that, simple, fornication, sex, between, unmarried, persons, was, not, a, sin, or, for, putting, in, doubt, different, aspects, of, christian, faith, such, as, transubstantiation, or, the, virginity, of, mary, also, members, of, the, clergy, themselves, were, occasionally, accused, of, heretical, propositions, these, offences, rarely, led, to, severe, penalties, pope, clement, vii, granted, the, inquisition, jurisdiction, over, sodomy, within, aragon, in, 1524, in, response, to, a, petition, from, the, saragossa, tribunal, the, inquisition, in, castile, declined, to, take, the, same, jurisdiction, making, sodomy, the, only, major, crime, with, such, a, significant, regional, discrepancy, even, within, aragon, the, treatment, of, sodomy, varied, significantly, by, region, because, the, pope, s, decree, required, that, it, be, prosecuted, according, to, each, area, s, local, law, for, instance, the, tribunal, of, the, city, of, zaragoza, was, considered, unusually, harsh, by, contemporaries, the, first, person, known, to, have, been, executed, by, the, inquisition, for, sodomy, was, a, priest, salvador, vidal, in, 1541, others, convicted, of, sodomy, received, sentences, including, fines, burning, in, effigy, public, whipping, and, the, galleys, the, first, burning, for, sodomy, took, place, in, valencia, in, 1572, sodomy, was, an, expansive, term, while, a, 1560, decision, ruled, that, lesbian, sex, not, involving, a, dildo, could, not, be, prosecuted, as, sodomy, bestiality, routinely, was, especially, in, saragossa, in, the, 1570s, men, might, also, be, prosecuted, based, on, accusations, of, engaging, in, heterosexual, sodomy, with, their, wives, for, that, time, and, place, the, word, sodomy, covered, several, kinds, of, not, procreative, sexual, acts, denounced, by, the, church, like, coitus, interruptus, masturbation, fellatio, anal, coitus, whether, heterosexual, or, homosexual, etc, those, accused, included, 19, clergy, 6, nobles, 37, workers, 19, servants, and, 18, soldiers, and, sailors, nearly, all, of, almost, 500, cases, of, sodomy, between, persons, concerned, the, relationship, between, an, older, man, and, an, adolescent, often, by, coercion, with, only, a, few, cases, where, the, couple, were, consenting, homosexual, adults, about, 100, of, the, total, involved, allegations, of, child, abuse, adolescents, were, generally, punished, more, leniently, than, adults, but, only, when, they, were, very, young, under, about, 12, years, or, when, the, case, clearly, concerned, rape, did, they, have, a, chance, to, avoid, punishment, altogether, prosecutions, for, sodomy, gradually, declined, in, large, part, due, to, decisions, from, the, suprema, intended, to, reduce, the, publicity, for, sodomy, cases, in, 1579, public, autos, de, f, ceased, to, include, people, convicted, on, sodomy, charges, unless, they, were, sentenced, to, death, even, the, death, sentences, were, excluded, from, public, proclamation, after, 1610, in, 1589, aragon, raised, the, minimum, age, for, sodomy, executions, to, 25, and, by, 1633, executions, for, sodomy, had, generally, come, to, an, end, the, roman, catholic, church, has, regarded, freemasonry, as, heretical, since, about, 1738, the, suspicion, of, freemasonry, was, potentially, a, capital, offence, spanish, inquisition, records, reveal, two, prosecutions, in, spain, and, only, a, few, more, throughout, the, spanish, empire, in, 1815, francisco, javier, de, mier, y, campillo, the, inquisitor, general, of, the, spanish, inquisition, and, the, bishop, of, almer, a, suppressed, freemasonry, and, denounced, the, lodges, as, societies, which, lead, to, atheism, to, sedition, and, to, all, errors, and, crimes, he, then, instituted, a, purge, during, which, spaniards, could, be, arrested, on, the, charge, of, being, suspected, of, freemasonry, as, one, manifestation, of, the, counter, reformation, the, spanish, inquisition, worked, actively, to, impede, the, diffusion, of, heretical, ideas, in, spain, by, producing, indexes, of, prohibited, books, such, lists, of, prohibited, books, were, common, in, europe, a, decade, before, the, inquisition, published, its, first, the, first, index, published, in, spain, in, 1551, was, in, reality, a, reprinting, of, the, index, published, by, the, university, of, leuven, in, 1550, with, an, appendix, dedicated, to, spanish, texts, subsequent, indexes, were, published, in, 1559, 1583, 1612, 1632, and, 1640, included, in, the, indices, at, one, point, were, some, of, the, great, works, of, spanish, literature, but, most, of, the, works, were, religious, in, nature, and, plays, a, number, of, religious, writers, who, are, today, considered, saints, by, the, catholic, church, saw, their, works, appear, in, the, indexes, at, first, this, might, seem, counter, intuitive, or, even, nonsensical, how, were, these, spanish, authors, published, in, the, first, place, if, their, texts, were, then, prohibited, by, the, inquisition, and, placed, in, the, index, the, answer, lies, in, the, process, of, publication, and, censorship, in, early, modern, spain, books, in, early, modern, spain, faced, prepublication, licensing, and, approval, which, could, include, modification, by, both, secular, and, religious, authorities, once, approved, and, published, the, circulating, text, also, faced, the, possibility, of, post, hoc, censorship, by, being, denounced, to, the, inquisition, sometimes, decades, later, likewise, as, catholic, theology, evolved, once, prohibited, texts, might, be, removed, from, the, index, at, first, inclusion, in, the, index, meant, total, prohibition, of, a, text, this, proved, not, only, impractical, and, unworkable, but, also, contrary, to, the, goals, of, having, a, literate, and, well, educated, clergy, in, time, a, compromise, solution, was, adopted, in, which, trusted, inquisition, officials, blotted, out, words, lines, or, whole, passages, of, otherwise, acceptable, texts, thus, allowing, these, expurgated, editions, to, circulate, although, in, theory, the, indexes, imposed, enormous, restrictions, on, the, diffusion, of, culture, in, spain, some, historians, argue, that, such, strict, control, was, impossible, in, practice, and, that, there, was, much, more, liberty, in, this, respect, than, is, often, believed, and, irving, leonard, has, conclusively, demonstrated, that, despite, repeated, royal, prohibitions, romances, of, chivalry, such, as, amadis, of, gaul, found, their, way, to, the, new, world, with, the, blessing, of, the, inquisition, moreover, with, the, coming, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, in, the, 18th, century, increasing, numbers, of, licenses, to, possess, and, read, prohibited, texts, were, granted, despite, the, repeated, publication, of, the, indexes, and, a, large, bureaucracy, of, censors, the, activities, of, the, inquisition, did, not, impede, the, development, of, spanish, literature, s, siglo, de, oro, although, almost, all, of, its, major, authors, crossed, paths, with, the, holy, office, at, one, point, or, another, among, the, spanish, authors, included, in, the, index, are, bartolom, torres, naharro, juan, del, enzina, jorge, de, montemayor, juan, de, vald, s, and, lope, de, vega, as, well, as, the, anonymous, lazarillo, de, tormes, and, the, cancionero, general, by, hernando, del, castillo, la, celestina, which, was, not, included, in, the, indexes, of, the, 16th, century, was, expurgated, in, 1632, and, prohibited, in, its, entirety, in, 1790, among, the, non, spanish, authors, prohibited, were, ovid, dante, rabelais, ariosto, machiavelli, erasmus, jean, bodin, valentine, naibod, and, thomas, more, known, in, spain, as, tom, s, moro, one, of, the, most, outstanding, and, best, known, cases, in, which, the, inquisition, directly, confronted, literary, activity, is, that, of, fray, luis, de, le, n, noted, humanist, and, religious, writer, of, converso, origin, who, was, imprisoned, for, four, years, from, 1572, to, 1576, for, having, translated, the, song, of, songs, directly, from, hebrew, one, of, the, main, effects, of, the, inquisition, was, to, end, free, thought, and, scientific, thought, in, spain, as, one, contemporary, spaniard, in, exile, put, it, our, country, is, a, land, of, pride, and, envy, barbarism, down, there, one, cannot, produce, any, culture, without, being, suspected, of, heresy, error, and, judaism, thus, silence, was, imposed, on, the, learned, for, the, next, few, centuries, while, the, rest, of, europe, was, slowly, awakened, by, the, influence, of, the, enlightenment, spain, stagnated, this, conclusion, is, contested, the, censorship, of, books, was, actually, very, ineffective, and, prohibited, books, circulated, in, spain, without, significant, problems, the, spanish, inquisition, never, persecuted, scientists, and, relatively, few, scientific, books, were, placed, on, the, index, on, the, other, hand, spain, was, a, state, with, more, political, freedom, than, in, other, absolute, monarchies, in, the, 16th, to, 18th, centuries, the, apparent, paradox, gets, explained, by, both, the, hermeticist, religious, ideas, of, the, spanish, church, and, monarchy, and, the, budding, seed, of, what, would, become, enlightened, absolutism, taking, shape, in, spain, the, list, of, banned, books, was, not, as, interpreted, sometimes, a, list, of, evil, books, but, a, list, of, books, that, lay, people, were, very, likely, to, misinterpret, the, presence, of, highly, symbolical, and, high, quality, literature, on, the, list, was, so, explained, these, metaphorical, or, parable, sounding, books, were, listed, as, not, meant, for, free, circulation, but, there, might, be, no, objections, to, the, book, itself, and, the, circulation, among, scholars, was, mostly, free, most, of, these, books, were, carefully, collected, by, the, elite, the, practical, totality, of, the, prohibited, books, can, be, found, now, as, then, in, the, library, of, the, monasterio, del, escorial, carefully, collected, by, philip, ii, and, philip, iii, the, collection, was, public, after, philip, ii, s, death, and, members, of, universities, intellectuals, courtesans, clergy, and, certain, branches, of, the, nobility, didn, t, have, too, many, problems, to, access, them, and, commission, authorised, copies, the, inquisition, has, not, been, known, to, make, any, serious, attempt, to, stop, this, for, all, the, books, but, there, are, some, records, of, them, suggesting, the, king, of, spain, to, stop, collecting, grimoires, or, magic, related, ones, the, inquisition, also, pursued, offenses, against, morals, and, general, social, order, at, times, in, open, conflict, with, the, jurisdictions, of, civil, tribunals, in, particular, there, were, trials, for, bigamy, a, relatively, frequent, offence, in, a, society, that, only, permitted, divorce, under, the, most, extreme, circumstances, in, the, case, of, men, the, penalty, was, two, hundred, lashes, and, five, to, ten, years, of, service, to, the, crown, said, service, could, be, whatever, the, court, deemed, most, beneficial, for, the, nation, but, it, usually, was, either, five, years, as, an, oarsman, in, a, royal, galley, for, those, without, any, qualification, possibly, a, death, sentence, or, ten, years, working, maintained, but, without, salary, in, a, public, hospital, or, charitable, institution, of, the, sort, for, those, with, some, special, skill, such, as, doctors, surgeons, or, lawyers, the, penalty, was, five, to, seven, years, as, an, oarsman, in, the, case, of, portugal, under, the, category, of, unnatural, marriage, fell, any, marriage, or, attempted, marriage, between, two, individuals, who, could, not, procreate, the, catholic, church, in, general, and, in, particular, a, nation, constantly, at, war, like, spain, emphasised, the, reproductive, goal, of, marriage, the, spanish, inquisition, s, policy, in, this, regard, was, restrictive, but, applied, in, a, very, egalitarian, way, it, considered, unnatural, any, non, reproductive, marriage, and, natural, any, reproductive, one, regardless, of, gender, or, sex, involved, the, two, forms, of, obvious, male, sterility, were, either, due, to, damage, to, the, genitals, through, castration, or, accidental, wounding, at, war, cap, n, or, to, some, genetic, condition, that, might, keep, the, man, from, completing, puberty, lampi, o, female, sterility, was, also, a, reason, to, declare, a, marriage, unnatural, but, was, harder, to, prove, one, case, that, dealt, with, marriage, sex, and, gender, was, the, trial, of, eleno, de, c, spedes, despite, popular, belief, the, role, of, the, inquisition, as, a, mainly, religious, institution, or, religious, in, nature, at, all, is, contested, at, best, its, main, function, was, that, of, private, police, for, the, crown, with, jurisdiction, to, enforce, the, law, in, those, crimes, that, took, place, in, the, private, sphere, of, life, the, notion, of, religion, and, civil, law, being, separate, is, a, modern, construction, and, made, no, sense, in, the, 15th, century, so, there, was, no, difference, between, breaking, a, law, regarding, religion, and, breaking, a, law, regarding, tax, collection, the, difference, between, them, is, a, modern, projection, the, institution, itself, did, not, have, as, such, the, inquisition, was, the, prosecutor, in, some, cases, the, only, prosecutor, of, any, crimes, that, could, be, perpetrated, without, the, public, taking, notice, mainly, domestic, crimes, crimes, against, the, weakest, members, of, society, administrative, crimes, and, forgeries, organized, crime, and, crimes, against, the, crown, examples, include, crimes, associated, with, sexual, or, family, relations, such, as, rape, and, sexual, violence, the, inquisition, was, the, first, and, only, body, who, punished, it, across, the, nation, bestiality, pedophilia, often, overlapping, with, sodomy, incest, child, abuse, or, neglect, and, as, discussed, bigamy, non, religious, crimes, also, included, procurement, not, prostitution, human, trafficking, smuggling, forgery, or, falsification, of, currency, documents, or, signatures, tax, fraud, many, religious, crimes, were, considered, subdivisions, of, this, one, illegal, weapons, swindles, disrespect, to, the, crown, or, its, institutions, the, inquisition, included, but, also, the, church, the, guard, and, the, kings, themselves, espionage, for, a, foreign, power, conspiracy, treason, the, non, religious, crimes, processed, by, the, inquisition, accounted, for, a, considerable, percentage, of, its, total, investigations, and, are, often, hard, to, separate, in, the, statistics, even, when, documentation, is, available, the, line, between, religious, and, non, religious, crimes, did, not, exist, in, 15th, century, spain, as, legal, concept, many, of, the, crimes, listed, here, and, some, of, the, religious, crimes, listed, in, previous, sections, were, contemplated, under, the, same, article, for, example, sodomy, included, paedophilia, as, a, subtype, often, part, of, the, data, given, for, prosecution, of, male, homosexuality, corresponds, to, convictions, for, paedophilia, not, adult, homosexuality, in, other, cases, religious, and, non, religious, crimes, were, seen, as, distinct, but, equivalent, the, treatment, of, public, blasphemy, and, street, swindlers, was, similar, since, both, involved, misleading, the, public, in, a, harmful, way, making, counterfeit, currency, and, heretic, proselytism, were, also, treated, similarly, both, of, them, were, punished, by, death, and, subdivided, in, similar, ways, since, both, were, spreading, falsifications, in, general, heresy, and, falsifications, of, material, documents, were, treated, similarly, by, the, spanish, inquisition, indicating, that, they, may, have, been, thought, of, as, equivalent, actions, trials, were, often, further, complicated, by, the, attempts, of, witnesses, or, victims, to, add, further, charges, especially, witchcraft, like, in, the, case, of, eleno, de, c, spedes, charges, for, witchcraft, done, in, this, way, or, in, general, were, quickly, dismissed, but, they, often, show, in, the, statistics, as, investigations, made, beyond, its, role, in, religious, affairs, the, inquisition, was, also, an, institution, at, the, service, of, the, monarchy, the, inquisitor, general, in, charge, of, the, holy, office, was, designated, by, the, crown, the, inquisitor, general, was, the, only, public, office, whose, authority, stretched, to, all, the, kingdoms, of, spain, including, the, american, viceroyalties, except, for, a, brief, period, 1507, 1518, during, which, there, were, two, inquisitors, general, one, in, the, kingdom, of, castile, and, the, other, in, aragon, the, inquisitor, general, presided, over, the, council, of, the, supreme, and, general, inquisition, generally, abbreviated, as, council, of, the, suprema, created, in, 1483, which, was, made, up, of, six, members, named, directly, by, the, crown, the, number, of, members, of, the, suprema, varied, over, the, course, of, the, inquisition, s, history, but, it, was, never, more, than, 10, over, time, the, authority, of, the, suprema, grew, at, the, expense, of, the, power, of, the, inquisitor, general, the, suprema, met, every, morning, except, for, holidays, and, for, two, hours, in, the, afternoon, on, tuesdays, thursdays, and, saturdays, the, morning, sessions, were, devoted, to, questions, of, faith, while, the, afternoons, were, reserved, for, minor, heresies, cases, of, perceived, unacceptable, sexual, behavior, bigamy, witchcraft, etc, below, the, suprema, were, the, various, tribunals, of, the, inquisition, which, were, originally, itinerant, installing, themselves, where, they, were, necessary, to, combat, heresy, but, later, being, established, in, fixed, locations, during, the, first, phase, numerous, tribunals, were, established, but, the, period, after, 1495, saw, a, marked, tendency, towards, centralization, in, the, kingdom, of, castile, the, following, permanent, tribunals, of, the, inquisition, were, established, there, were, only, four, tribunals, in, the, kingdom, of, aragon, zaragoza, and, valencia, 1482, barcelona, 1484, and, majorca, 1488, ferdinand, the, catholic, also, established, the, spanish, inquisition, in, sicily, 1513, housed, in, palermo, and, sardinia, in, the, town, of, sassari, in, the, americas, tribunals, were, established, in, lima, and, in, mexico, city, 1569, and, in, 1610, in, cartagena, de, indias, present, day, colombia, initially, each, of, the, tribunals, included, two, inquisitors, calificadors, qualifiers, an, alguacil, bailiff, and, a, fiscal, prosecutor, new, positions, were, added, as, the, institution, matured, the, inquisitors, were, preferably, jurists, more, than, theologians, in, 1608, philip, iii, even, stipulated, that, all, inquisitors, needed, to, have, a, background, in, law, the, inquisitors, did, not, typically, remain, in, the, position, for, a, long, time, for, the, court, of, valencia, for, example, the, average, tenure, in, the, position, was, about, two, years, most, of, the, inquisitors, belonged, to, the, secular, clergy, priests, who, were, not, members, of, religious, orders, and, had, a, university, education, the, fiscal, was, in, charge, of, presenting, the, accusation, investigating, the, denunciations, and, interrogating, the, witnesses, by, the, use, of, physical, and, mental, torture, the, calificadores, were, generally, theologians, it, fell, to, them, to, determine, whether, the, defendant, s, conduct, added, up, to, a, crime, against, the, faith, consultants, were, expert, jurists, who, advised, the, court, in, questions, of, procedure, the, court, had, in, addition, three, secretaries, the, notario, de, secuestros, notary, of, property, who, registered, the, goods, of, the, accused, at, the, moment, of, his, detention, the, notario, del, secreto, notary, of, the, secret, who, recorded, the, testimony, of, the, defendant, and, the, witnesses, and, the, escribano, general, general, notary, secretary, of, the, court, the, alguacil, was, the, executive, arm, of, the, court, responsible, for, detaining, jailing, and, physically, torturing, the, defendant, other, civil, employees, were, the, nuncio, ordered, to, spread, official, notices, of, the, court, and, the, alcaide, the, jailer, in, charge, of, feeding, the, prisoners, in, addition, to, the, members, of, the, court, two, auxiliary, figures, existed, that, collaborated, with, the, holy, office, the, familiares, and, the, comissarios, commissioners, familiares, were, lay, collaborators, of, the, inquisition, who, had, to, be, permanently, at, the, service, of, the, holy, office, to, become, a, familiar, was, considered, an, honor, since, it, was, a, public, recognition, of, limpieza, de, sangre, old, christian, status, and, brought, with, it, certain, additional, privileges, although, many, nobles, held, the, position, most, of, the, familiares, came, from, the, ranks, of, commoners, the, commissioners, on, the, other, hand, were, members, of, the, religious, orders, who, collaborated, occasionally, with, the, holy, office, one, of, the, most, striking, aspects, of, the, organization, of, the, inquisition, was, its, form, of, financing, devoid, of, its, own, budget, the, inquisition, depended, almost, exclusively, on, the, confiscation, of, the, goods, of, the, denounced, it, is, not, surprising, therefore, that, many, of, those, prosecuted, were, rich, men, that, the, situation, was, open, to, abuse, is, evident, as, stands, out, in, the, memorandum, that, a, converso, from, toledo, directed, to, charles, i, your, majesty, must, provide, before, all, else, that, the, expenses, of, the, holy, office, do, not, come, from, the, properties, of, the, condemned, because, if, that, is, the, case, if, they, do, not, burn, they, do, not, eat, when, the, inquisition, arrived, in, a, city, the, first, step, was, the, edict, of, grace, following, the, sunday, mass, the, inquisitor, would, proceed, to, read, the, edict, which, described, possible, heresies, and, encouraged, all, the, congregation, to, come, to, the, tribunals, of, the, inquisition, to, relieve, their, consciences, they, were, called, edicts, of, grace, because, all, of, the, self, incriminated, who, presented, themselves, within, a, period, of, grace, usually, ranging, from, thirty, to, forty, days, were, offered, the, possibility, of, reconciliation, with, the, church, without, severe, punishment, the, promise, of, benevolence, was, effective, and, many, voluntarily, presented, themselves, to, the, inquisition, these, were, encouraged, to, denounce, others, who, had, also, committed, offences, informants, being, the, inquisition, s, primary, source, of, information, after, about, 1500, the, edicts, of, grace, were, replaced, by, the, edicts, of, faith, which, left, out, the, grace, period, and, instead, encouraged, the, denunciation, of, those, deemed, guilty, the, denunciations, were, anonymous, and, the, defendants, had, no, way, of, knowing, the, identities, of, their, accusers, this, was, one, of, the, points, most, criticized, by, those, who, opposed, the, inquisition, in, practice, false, denunciations, were, frequent, denunciations, were, made, for, a, variety, of, reasons, apart, from, genuine, concern, some, just, went, after, non, conformists, others, wished, to, hurt, a, neighbor, or, get, rid, of, an, opponent, this, method, turned, everyone, into, an, agent, of, the, inquisition, and, made, every, man, aware, that, a, simple, word, or, deed, could, bring, him, before, the, tribunal, denunciation, was, elevated, to, the, rank, of, a, superior, religious, duty, filled, the, nation, with, spies, and, made, each, individual, an, object, of, suspicion, to, his, neighbor, his, family, and, any, strangers, he, might, meet, after, a, denunciation, the, case, was, examined, by, the, calificadores, who, had, to, determine, whether, there, was, heresy, involved, this, was, followed, by, the, detention, of, the, accused, in, practice, many, were, detained, in, preventive, custody, and, many, cases, of, lengthy, incarcerations, occurred, lasting, up, to, two, years, before, the, calificadores, examined, the, case, detention, of, the, accused, entailed, the, preventive, sequestration, of, their, property, by, the, inquisition, the, property, of, the, prisoner, was, used, to, pay, for, procedural, expenses, and, the, accused, s, own, maintenance, and, costs, often, the, relatives, of, the, defendant, found, themselves, in, outright, misery, this, situation, was, remedied, only, following, instructions, written, in, 1561, however, llorente, despite, having, consulted, numerous, records, of, old, inquisition, proceedings, did, not, find, any, record, of, such, an, agreement, in, favor, of, the, children, of, condemned, heretics, some, authors, such, as, apologist, william, thomas, walsh, stated, that, the, entire, process, was, undertaken, with, the, utmost, secrecy, as, much, for, the, public, as, for, the, accused, who, were, not, informed, about, the, accusations, that, were, levied, against, them, months, or, even, years, could, pass, without, the, accused, being, informed, about, why, they, were, imprisoned, the, prisoners, remained, isolated, and, during, this, time, they, were, not, allowed, to, attend, mass, nor, receive, the, sacraments, the, jails, of, the, inquisition, were, no, worse, than, those, of, secular, authorities, and, there, are, even, certain, testimonies, that, occasionally, they, were, much, better, according, to, william, walsh, the, miseries, of, the, jews, are, not, the, result, fundamentally, of, the, hatred, and, misunderstanding, of, others, but, the, consequence, of, their, own, stubborn, rejection, of, our, lord, and, saviour, jesus, christ, the, inquisitorial, process, consisted, of, a, series, of, hearings, in, which, both, the, denouncers, and, the, defendant, gave, separate, testimony, a, defense, counsel, a, so, called, lawyer, a, member, of, the, tribunal, itself, was, assigned, to, the, defendant, his, role, was, simply, to, advise, the, accused, and, to, encourage, them, to, speak, the, truth, he, was, obliged, to, renounce, the, defense, at, the, moment, when, he, realized, his, client, s, guilt, the, prosecution, was, directed, by, the, fiscal, interrogation, of, the, defendant, was, done, in, the, presence, of, the, notario, del, secreto, who, meticulously, wrote, down, the, words, of, the, accused, the, archives, of, the, inquisition, in, comparison, to, those, of, other, judicial, systems, of, the, era, are, striking, in, the, completeness, of, their, documentation, to, defend, themselves, the, accused, had, two, main, choices, abonos, to, find, favourable, and, character, witnesses, or, tachas, to, demonstrate, that, the, witnesses, of, accusers, whose, identity, he, did, not, know, were, not, trustworthy, and, were, his, personal, enemies, the, structure, of, the, trials, was, similar, to, modern, trials, and, according, to, apologists, advanced, for, the, time, with, regard, to, fairness, the, inquisition, professional, and, efficient, was, dependent, on, the, political, power, of, the, king, the, lack, of, separation, of, powers, allows, assuming, questionable, fairness, for, certain, scenarios, the, fairness, of, the, inquisitorial, tribunals, is, alleged, by, apologists, to, be, among, the, best, in, early, modern, europe, when, it, came, to, the, trial, of, laymen, there, are, also, testimonies, by, former, prisoners, that, if, believed, suggest, that, said, fairness, was, less, than, ideal, when, national, or, political, interests, were, involved, the, historian, walter, ullmann, thinks, very, different, to, obtain, a, confession, or, information, relevant, to, an, investigation, the, inquisition, used, torture, as, prescribed, in, the, instrucciones, it, is, impossible, to, determine, with, any, degree, of, accuracy, the, number, of, cases, in, which, it, was, employed, during, the, inquisition, s, existence, torture, would, be, applied, if, the, alleged, heresy, was, half, proven, and, could, be, repeated, according, to, article, xv, of, torquemada, instructions, henry, lea, estimates, that, between, 1575, and, 1610, the, court, of, toledo, tortured, approximately, a, third, of, those, processed, for, protestant, heresy, nearly, all, of, the, accused, in, several, cases, tried, by, the, lima, tribunal, between, 1635, and, 1639, appear, to, have, been, tortured, the, valladolid, tribunal, report, for, 1624, reveals, that, in, eleven, cases, involving, jews, and, one, involving, a, protestant, used, torture, in, 1655, all, nine, cases, involving, jews, employed, torture, the, recently, opened, vatican, archives, suggest, lower, numbers, in, truth, says, thomas, madden, the, inquisition, brought, order, justice, and, compassion, to, combat, rampant, secular, and, popular, persecutions, of, heretics, and, concludes, the, spanish, people, loved, their, inquisition, that, is, why, it, lasted, for, so, long, in, other, periods, the, proportions, of, torture, varied, remarkably, torture, was, employed, in, all, civil, and, religious, trials, in, europe, the, spanish, inquisition, allegedly, used, it, more, restrictively, than, was, common, at, the, time, unlike, both, civil, trials, and, other, inquisitions, it, had, strict, regulations, in, relation, to, when, what, whom, frequency, duration, and, supervision, according, to, some, scholars, the, spanish, inquisition, engaged, in, torture, less, often, and, with, greater, care, than, secular, courts, among, the, methods, of, torture, allowed, were, garrucha, toca, and, the, potro, which, were, all, used, in, other, secular, and, ecclesiastical, tribunals, the, application, of, the, garrucha, also, known, as, the, strappado, consisted, of, suspending, the, victim, from, the, ceiling, by, the, wrists, which, are, tied, behind, the, back, sometimes, weights, were, tied, to, the, feet, with, a, series, of, lifts, and, violent, drops, during, which, the, arms, and, legs, suffered, violent, pulls, and, were, sometimes, dislocated, the, use, of, the, toca, cloth, also, called, interrogatorio, mejorado, del, agua, enhanced, water, interrogation, now, known, as, waterboarding, is, better, documented, it, consisted, of, forcing, the, victim, to, ingest, water, poured, from, a, jar, so, that, they, had, the, impression, of, drowning, the, potro, the, rack, in, which, the, limbs, were, slowly, pulled, apart, was, thought, to, be, the, instrument, of, torture, used, most, frequently, the, assertion, that, confessionem, esse, veram, non, factam, vi, tormentorum, literally, confession, is, truth, not, made, by, way, of, torture, sometimes, follows, a, description, of, how, after, torture, had, ended, the, subject, freely, confessed, to, the, offences, in, practice, those, who, recanted, confessions, made, during, torture, knew, that, they, could, be, tortured, again, under, torture, or, even, harsh, interrogation, comments, cullen, murphy, people, will, say, anything, bernard, d, licieux, the, franciscan, friar, who, was, tortured, by, the, inquisition, and, ultimately, died, in, prison, as, a, result, of, the, abuse, said, the, inquisition, s, tactics, would, have, proved, st, peter, and, st, paul, to, be, heretics, once, the, process, concluded, the, inquisidores, met, with, a, representative, of, the, bishop, and, with, the, consultores, consultants, experts, in, theology, or, canon, law, but, not, necessarily, clergy, themselves, which, was, called, the, consulta, de, fe, faith, consultation, religion, check, the, case, was, voted, and, sentence, pronounced, which, had, to, be, unanimous, in, case, of, discrepancies, the, suprema, had, to, be, informed, the, results, of, the, trial, could, be, the, following, frequently, cases, were, judged, in, absentia, when, the, accused, died, before, the, trial, finished, the, condemned, were, burned, in, effigy, the, death, of, an, accused, did, not, extinguish, the, inquisitorial, actions, even, up, to, forty, years, after, the, death, when, it, was, considered, proven, that, the, deceased, were, heretics, in, their, lifetime, their, corpses, were, exhumed, and, burned, their, property, confiscated, and, the, heirs, disinherited, the, distribution, of, the, punishments, varied, considerably, over, time, it, is, believed, that, sentences, of, death, were, enforced, most, frequently, in, the, early, stages, within, the, long, history, of, the, inquisition, according, to, garc, a, c, rcel, one, of, the, most, active, courts, the, court, of, valencia, employed, the, death, penalty, in, 40, of, cases, before, 1530, but, later, that, percentage, dropped, to, 3, by, the, middle, of, the, 16th, century, inquisition, courts, viewed, torture, as, unnecessary, and, death, sentences, had, become, rare, if, the, sentence, was, condemnatory, this, implied, that, the, condemned, had, to, participate, in, the, ceremony, of, an, auto, de, f, more, commonly, known, in, english, as, an, auto, da, f, that, solemnized, their, return, to, the, church, in, most, cases, or, punishment, as, an, impenitent, heretic, the, autos, de, f, could, be, public, auto, publico, or, auto, general, or, private, auto, particular, although, initially, the, public, autos, did, not, have, any, special, solemnity, nor, sought, a, large, attendance, of, spectators, with, time, they, became, expensive, and, solemn, ceremonies, a, display, of, the, great, power, shared, by, the, church, and, the, state, celebrated, with, large, public, crowds, amidst, a, festive, atmosphere, the, auto, de, f, eventually, became, a, baroque, spectacle, with, staging, meticulously, calculated, to, cause, the, greatest, effect, among, the, spectators, the, autos, were, conducted, in, a, large, public, space, frequently, in, the, largest, plaza, of, the, city, generally, on, holidays, the, rituals, related, to, the, auto, began, the, previous, night, the, procession, of, the, green, cross, and, sometimes, lasted, the, whole, day, the, auto, de, f, frequently, was, taken, to, the, canvas, by, painters, one, of, the, better, known, examples, is, the, 1683, painting, by, francisco, rizi, held, by, the, prado, museum, in, madrid, that, represents, the, auto, celebrated, in, the, plaza, mayor, of, madrid, on, 30, june, 1680, the, last, public, auto, de, f, took, place, in, 1691, the, auto, de, f, involved, a, catholic, mass, prayer, a, public, procession, of, those, found, guilty, and, a, reading, of, their, sentences, they, took, place, in, public, squares, or, esplanades, and, lasted, several, hours, ecclesiastical, and, civil, authorities, attended, artistic, representations, of, the, auto, de, f, usually, depict, torture, and, the, burning, at, the, stake, this, type, of, activity, never, took, place, during, an, auto, de, f, which, was, in, essence, a, religious, act, torture, was, not, administered, after, a, trial, concluded, and, executions, were, always, held, after, and, separate, from, the, auto, de, f, though, in, the, minds, and, experiences, of, observers, and, those, undergoing, the, confession, and, execution, the, separation, of, the, two, might, be, experienced, as, merely, a, technicality, the, first, recorded, auto, de, f, was, held, in, paris, in, 1242, during, the, reign, of, louis, ix, the, first, spanish, auto, de, f, did, not, take, place, until, 1481, in, seville, six, of, the, men, and, women, subjected, to, this, first, religious, ritual, were, later, executed, the, inquisition, had, limited, power, in, portugal, having, been, established, in, 1536, and, officially, lasting, until, 1821, although, its, influence, was, much, weakened, with, the, government, of, the, marquis, of, pombal, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, the, marquis, himself, a, familiar, transformed, it, into, a, royal, court, and, the, heretics, continued, to, be, persecuted, as, so, the, high, spirits, autos, de, f, also, took, place, in, mexico, brazil, and, peru, contemporary, historians, of, the, conquistadors, such, as, bernal, d, az, del, castillo, record, them, they, also, took, place, in, the, portuguese, colony, of, goa, india, following, the, establishment, of, inquisition, there, in, 1562, 1563, the, arrival, of, the, enlightenment, in, spain, slowed, inquisitorial, activity, in, the, first, half, of, the, 18th, century, 111, were, condemned, to, be, burned, in, person, and, 117, in, effigy, most, of, them, for, judaizing, in, the, reign, of, philip, v, there, were, 125, autos, de, f, while, in, the, reigns, of, charles, iii, and, charles, iv, only, 44, during, the, 18th, century, the, inquisition, changed, enlightenment, ideas, were, the, closest, threat, that, had, to, be, fought, the, main, figures, of, the, spanish, enlightenment, were, in, favour, of, the, abolition, of, the, inquisition, and, many, were, processed, by, the, holy, office, among, them, olavide, in, 1776, iriarte, in, 1779, and, jovellanos, in, 1796, jovellanos, sent, a, report, to, charles, iv, in, which, he, indicated, the, inefficiency, of, the, inquisition, s, courts, and, the, ignorance, of, those, who, operated, them, friars, who, take, only, to, obtain, gossip, and, exemption, from, the, choir, who, are, ignorant, of, foreign, languages, who, only, know, a, little, scholastic, theology, in, its, new, role, the, inquisition, tried, to, accentuate, its, function, of, censoring, publications, but, found, that, charles, iii, had, secularized, censorship, procedures, and, on, many, occasions, the, authorization, of, the, council, of, castile, hit, the, more, intransigent, position, of, the, inquisition, since, the, inquisition, itself, was, an, arm, of, the, state, being, within, the, council, of, castile, civil, rather, than, ecclesiastical, censorship, usually, prevailed, this, loss, of, influence, can, also, be, explained, because, the, foreign, enlightenment, texts, entered, the, peninsula, through, prominent, members, of, the, nobility, or, government, influential, people, with, whom, it, was, very, difficult, to, interfere, thus, for, example, diderot, s, encyclopedia, entered, spain, thanks, to, special, licenses, granted, by, the, king, after, the, french, revolution, the, council, of, castile, fearing, that, revolutionary, ideas, would, penetrate, spain, s, borders, decided, to, reactivate, the, holy, office, that, was, directly, charged, with, the, persecution, of, french, works, an, inquisition, edict, of, december, 1789, that, received, the, full, approval, of, charles, iv, and, floridablanca, stated, that, having, news, that, several, books, have, been, scattered, and, promoted, in, these, kingdoms, that, without, being, contented, with, the, simple, narration, events, of, a, seditious, nature, seem, to, form, a, theoretical, and, practical, code, of, independence, from, the, legitimate, powers, destroying, in, this, way, the, political, and, social, order, the, reading, of, thirty, and, nine, french, works, is, prohibited, under, fine, the, fight, from, within, against, the, inquisition, was, almost, always, clandestine, the, first, texts, that, questioned, the, inquisition, and, praised, the, ideas, of, voltaire, or, montesquieu, appeared, in, 1759, after, the, suspension, of, pre, publication, censorship, on, the, part, of, the, council, of, castile, in, 1785, the, newspaper, el, censor, began, the, publication, of, protests, against, the, activities, of, the, holy, office, by, means, of, a, rationalist, critique, valentin, de, foronda, published, esp, ritu, de, los, mejores, diarios, a, plea, in, favour, of, freedom, of, expression, that, was, avidly, read, in, the, salons, also, in, the, same, vein, manuel, de, aguirre, wrote, on, toleration, in, el, censor, el, correo, de, los, ciegos, and, el, diario, de, madrid, during, the, reign, of, charles, iv, of, spain, 1788, 1808, in, spite, of, the, fears, that, the, french, revolution, provoked, several, events, accelerated, the, decline, of, the, inquisition, the, state, stopped, being, a, mere, social, organizer, and, began, to, worry, about, the, well, being, of, the, public, as, a, result, the, land, holding, power, of, the, church, was, reconsidered, in, the, se, or, os, and, more, generally, in, the, accumulated, wealth, that, had, prevented, social, progress, the, power, of, the, throne, increased, under, which, enlightenment, thinkers, found, better, protection, for, their, ideas, manuel, godoy, and, antonio, alcal, galiano, were, openly, hostile, to, an, institution, whose, only, role, had, been, reduced, to, censorship, and, was, the, very, embodiment, of, the, spanish, black, legend, internationally, and, was, not, suitable, to, the, political, interests, of, the, moment, the, inquisition, its, old, power, no, longer, exists, the, horrible, authority, that, this, bloodthirsty, court, had, exerted, in, other, times, was, reduced, the, holy, office, had, come, to, be, a, species, of, commission, for, book, censorship, nothing, more, the, inquisition, was, first, abolished, during, the, domination, of, napoleon, and, the, reign, of, joseph, bonaparte, 1808, 1812, in, 1813, the, liberal, deputies, of, the, cortes, of, c, diz, also, obtained, its, abolition, largely, as, a, result, of, the, holy, office, s, condemnation, of, the, popular, revolt, against, french, invasion, but, the, inquisition, was, reconstituted, when, ferdinand, vii, recovered, the, throne, on, 1, july, 1814, juan, antonio, llorente, who, had, been, the, inquisition, s, general, secretary, in, 1789, became, a, bonapartist, and, published, a, critical, history, in, 1817, from, his, french, exile, based, on, his, privileged, access, to, its, archives, possibly, as, a, result, of, llorente, s, criticisms, the, inquisition, was, once, again, temporarily, abolished, during, the, three, year, liberal, interlude, known, as, the, trienio, liberal, but, still, the, old, system, had, not, yet, had, its, last, gasp, later, during, the, period, known, as, the, ominous, decade, the, inquisition, was, not, formally, re, established, although, de, facto, it, returned, under, the, so, called, congregation, of, the, meetings, of, faith, juntas, da, f, created, in, the, dioceses, by, king, ferdinand, vii, on, 26, july, 1826, the, meetings, of, faith, congregation, condemned, and, executed, the, school, teacher, cayetano, ripoll, who, thus, became, the, last, person, known, to, be, executed, by, the, inquisition, on, that, day, ripoll, was, hanged, in, valencia, for, having, taught, deist, principles, this, execution, occurred, against, the, backdrop, of, a, european, wide, scandal, concerning, the, despotic, attitudes, still, prevailing, in, spain, finally, on, 15, july, 1834, the, spanish, inquisition, was, definitively, abolished, by, a, royal, decree, signed, by, regent, maria, christina, of, the, two, sicilies, ferdinand, vii, s, liberal, widow, during, the, minority, of, isabella, ii, and, with, the, approval, of, the, president, of, the, cabinet, francisco, mart, nez, de, la, rosa, the, alhambra, decree, that, had, expelled, the, jews, was, formally, rescinded, on, 16, december, 1968, by, the, spanish, dictator, francisco, franco, after, the, second, vatican, council, rejected, the, idea, that, jews, are, deicides, the, prohibitions, persecution, and, eventual, jewish, mass, emigration, from, spain, and, portugal, probably, had, adverse, effects, on, the, development, of, the, spanish, and, the, portuguese, economy, jews, and, non, catholic, christians, reportedly, had, substantially, better, numerical, skills, than, the, catholic, majority, which, might, be, due, to, the, jewish, religious, doctrine, which, focused, strongly, on, education, even, when, jews, were, forced, to, quit, their, highly, skilled, urban, occupations, their, numeracy, advantage, persisted, however, during, the, inquisition, spillover, effects, of, these, skills, were, rare, because, of, forced, separation, and, jewish, emigration, which, was, detrimental, for, economic, development, it, is, unknown, exactly, how, much, wealth, was, confiscated, from, converted, jews, and, others, tried, by, the, inquisition, wealth, confiscated, in, one, year, of, persecution, in, the, small, town, of, guadaloupe, paid, the, costs, of, building, a, royal, residence, there, are, numerous, records, of, the, opinion, of, ordinary, spaniards, of, the, time, that, the, inquisition, was, devised, simply, to, rob, people, they, were, burnt, only, for, the, money, they, had, a, resident, of, cuenca, averred, they, burn, only, the, well, off, said, another, in, 1504, an, accused, stated, only, the, rich, were, burnt, in, 1484, catalina, de, zamora, was, accused, of, asserting, that, this, inquisition, that, the, fathers, are, carrying, out, is, as, much, for, taking, property, from, the, conversos, as, for, defending, the, faith, it, is, the, goods, that, are, the, heretics, this, saying, passed, into, common, usage, in, spain, in, 1524, a, treasurer, informed, charles, v, that, his, predecessor, had, received, ten, million, ducats, from, the, conversos, but, the, figure, is, unverified, in, 1592, an, inquisitor, admitted, that, most, of, the, fifty, women, he, arrested, were, rich, in, 1676, the, suprema, claimed, it, had, confiscated, over, 700, 000, ducats, for, the, royal, treasury, which, was, paid, money, only, after, the, inquisition, s, own, budget, amounting, in, one, known, case, to, only, 5, the, property, on, mallorca, alone, in, 1678, was, worth, well, over, 2, 500, 000, ducats, garc, a, c, rcel, estimates, that, the, total, number, prosecuted, by, the, inquisition, throughout, its, history, was, approximately, 150, 000, applying, the, percentages, of, executions, that, appeared, in, the, trials, of, 1560, 1700, about, 2, the, approximate, total, would, be, about, 3, 000, put, to, death, nevertheless, some, authors, consider, that, the, toll, may, have, been, higher, keeping, in, mind, the, data, provided, by, dedieu, and, garc, a, c, rcel, for, the, tribunals, of, toledo, and, valencia, respectively, and, estimate, between, 3, 000, and, 5, 000, were, executed, other, authors, disagree, and, estimate, a, max, death, toll, between, 1, and, 5, depending, on, the, time, span, used, combining, all, the, processes, the, inquisition, carried, both, religious, and, non, religious, ones, in, either, case, this, is, significantly, lower, than, the, number, of, people, executed, exclusively, for, witchcraft, in, other, parts, of, europe, during, about, the, same, time, span, as, the, spanish, inquisition, estimated, at, c, 40, 000, 60, 000, modern, historians, have, begun, to, study, the, documentary, records, of, the, inquisition, the, archives, of, the, suprema, today, held, by, the, national, historical, archive, of, spain, archivo, hist, rico, nacional, conserves, the, annual, relations, of, all, processes, between, 1540, and, 1700, this, material, provides, information, for, approximately, 44, 674, judgments, these, 44, 674, cases, include, 826, executions, in, persona, and, 778, in, effigie, i, e, an, effigy, was, burned, this, material, is, far, from, being, complete, for, example, the, tribunal, of, cuenca, is, entirely, omitted, because, no, relaciones, de, causas, from, this, tribunal, have, been, found, and, significant, gaps, concern, some, other, tribunals, e, g, valladolid, many, more, cases, not, reported, to, the, suprema, are, known, from, the, other, sources, i, e, no, relaciones, de, causas, from, cuenca, have, been, found, but, its, original, records, have, been, preserved, but, were, not, included, in, contreras, henningsen, s, statistics, for, the, methodological, reasons, william, monter, estimates, 1000, executions, between, 1530, and, 1630, and, 250, between, 1630, and, 1730, the, archives, of, the, suprema, only, provide, information, about, processes, prior, to, 1560, to, study, the, processes, themselves, it, is, necessary, to, examine, the, archives, of, the, local, tribunals, the, majority, of, which, have, been, lost, to, the, devastation, of, war, the, ravages, of, time, or, other, events, some, archives, have, survived, including, those, of, toledo, where, 12, 000, were, judged, for, offences, related, to, heresy, mainly, minor, blasphemy, and, those, of, valencia, these, indicate, that, the, inquisition, was, most, active, in, the, period, between, 1480, and, 1530, and, that, during, this, period, the, percentage, condemned, to, death, was, much, more, significant, than, in, the, years, that, followed, modern, estimates, show, approximately, 2, 000, executions, in, persona, in, the, whole, of, spain, up, to, 1530, the, statistics, of, henningsen, and, contreras, are, based, entirely, on, relaciones, de, causas, the, number, of, years, for, which, cases, are, documented, varies, for, different, tribunals, data, for, the, aragonese, secretariat, are, probably, complete, some, small, lacunae, may, concern, only, valencia, and, possibly, sardinia, and, cartagena, but, the, numbers, for, castilian, secretariat, except, canaries, and, galicia, should, be, considered, as, minimal, due, to, gaps, in, the, documentation, in, some, cases, it, is, remarked, that, the, number, does, not, concern, the, whole, period, 1540, 1700, table, of, sentences, pronounced, in, the, public, autos, de, f, in, spain, excluding, tribunals, in, sicily, sardinia, and, latin, america, between, 1701, and, 1746, according, to, toby, green, the, great, unchecked, power, given, to, inquisitors, meant, that, they, were, widely, seen, as, above, the, law, and, they, sometimes, had, motives, for, imprisoning, or, executing, alleged, offenders, that, had, nothing, to, do, with, punishing, religious, nonconformity, green, quotes, a, complaint, by, historian, manuel, barrios, about, one, inquisitor, diego, rodriguez, lucero, who, in, cordoba, in, 1506, burned, to, death, the, husbands, of, two, women, he, then, kept, the, women, as, mistresses, according, to, barrios, the, daughter, of, diego, celemin, was, exceptionally, beautiful, her, parents, and, her, husband, did, not, want, to, give, her, to, and, so, lucero, had, the, three, of, them, burnt, and, now, has, a, child, by, her, and, he, has, kept, for, a, long, time, in, the, alcazar, as, a, mistress, some, writers, disagree, with, green, these, authors, do, not, necessarily, deny, the, abuses, of, power, but, classify, them, as, politically, instigated, and, comparable, to, those, of, any, other, law, enforcement, body, of, the, period, criticisms, usually, indirect, have, gone, from, the, suspiciously, sexual, overtones, or, similarities, of, these, accounts, with, unrelated, older, antisemitic, accounts, of, kidnap, and, torture, to, the, clear, proofs, of, control, that, the, king, had, over, the, institution, to, the, sources, used, by, green, or, just, by, reaching, completely, different, conclusions, according, to, a, 2021, study, municipalities, of, spain, with, a, history, of, a, stronger, inquisitorial, presence, show, lower, economic, performance, educational, attainment, and, trust, today, how, historians, and, commentators, have, viewed, the, spanish, inquisition, has, changed, over, time, and, continues, to, be, a, source, of, controversy, before, and, during, the, 19th, century, historical, interest, focused, on, who, was, being, persecuted, in, the, early, and, mid, 20th, century, historians, examined, the, specifics, of, what, happened, and, how, it, influenced, spanish, history, in, the, later, 20th, and, 21st, century, some, historians, have, re, examined, how, severe, the, inquisition, really, was, calling, into, question, some, of, the, assumptions, made, in, earlier, periods, before, the, rise, of, professional, historians, in, the, 19th, century, the, spanish, inquisition, had, been, portrayed, primarily, by, protestant, scholars, who, saw, it, as, the, archetypal, symbol, of, catholic, intolerance, and, ecclesiastical, power, the, spanish, inquisition, for, them, was, largely, associated, with, the, persecution, of, protestants, william, h, prescott, described, the, inquisition, as, an, eye, that, never, slumbered, despite, the, existence, of, extensive, documentation, regarding, the, trials, and, procedures, and, to, the, inquisition, s, deep, bureaucratization, none, of, these, sources, was, studied, outside, of, spain, and, spanish, scholars, arguing, against, the, predominant, view, were, automatically, dismissed, the, 19th, century, professional, historians, including, the, spanish, scholar, amador, de, los, r, os, were, the, first, to, successfully, challenge, this, perception, in, the, international, sphere, and, get, foreign, scholars, to, take, note, of, their, discoveries, said, scholars, would, obtain, international, recognition, and, start, a, period, of, revision, on, the, black, legend, of, the, spanish, inquisition, at, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, henry, charles, lea, published, the, groundbreaking, history, of, the, inquisition, in, spain, this, influential, work, describes, the, spanish, inquisition, as, an, engine, of, immense, power, constantly, applied, for, the, furtherance, of, obscurantism, the, repression, of, thought, the, exclusion, of, foreign, ideas, and, the, obstruction, of, progress, lea, documented, the, inquisition, s, methods, and, modes, of, operation, in, no, uncertain, terms, calling, it, theocratic, absolutism, at, its, worst, in, the, context, of, the, polarization, between, protestants, and, catholics, during, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, some, of, lea, s, contemporaries, as, well, as, most, modern, scholars, thought, lea, s, work, had, an, anti, catholic, bias, starting, in, the, 1920s, jewish, scholars, picked, up, where, lea, s, work, left, off, they, published, yitzhak, baer, s, history, of, the, jews, in, christian, spain, cecil, roth, s, history, of, the, marranos, and, after, world, war, ii, the, work, of, haim, beinart, who, for, the, first, time, published, trial, transcripts, of, cases, involving, conversos, contemporary, historians, who, subscribe, to, the, idea, that, the, image, of, the, inquisition, in, historiography, has, been, systematically, deformed, by, the, black, legend, include, edward, peters, philip, wayne, powell, william, s, maltby, richard, kagan, margaret, r, greer, helen, rawlings, ronnie, hsia, lu, ann, homza, stanley, g, payne, andrea, donofrio, irene, silverblatt, christopher, schmidt, nowara, charles, gibson, and, joseph, p, rez, contemporary, historians, who, partially, accept, an, impact, of, the, black, legend, but, deny, other, aspects, of, the, hypothesis, include, henry, kamen, david, nirenberg, and, karen, armstrong, toby, green, while, accepting, that, there, was, a, certain, demonization, of, the, spanish, inquisition, in, comparison, with, other, contemporary, persecutions, argues, that, the, habitual, use, of, torture, should, not, be, denied, and, that, correcting, the, black, legend, should, not, mean, replacing, it, with, a, white, legend, richard, l, kagan, says, that, henry, kamen, failed, to, enter, the, belly, of, the, beast, and, assess, what, it, really, meant, to, the, people, who, lived, with, it, kamen, does, not, according, to, kagan, lead, the, reader, through, an, actual, trial, had, he, done, so, a, reader, might, conclude, that, the, institution, he, portrays, as, relatively, benign, in, hindsight, was, also, capable, of, inspiring, fear, and, desperate, attempts, to, escape, and, thus, more, deserving, of, its, earlier, reputation, for, kagan, in, order, to, reconstruct, the, world, of, those, who, were, trapped, in, the, inquisition, s, net, studies, that, thoroughly, examine, the, meticulous, archives, of, the, inquisition, are, necessary, the, works, of, juderias, in, 1913, and, other, spanish, scholars, prior, to, him, were, mostly, ignored, by, international, scholarship, until, 1960, one, of, the, first, books, to, build, on, them, and, internationally, challenge, the, classical, view, was, the, spanish, inquisition, 1965, by, henry, kamen, kamen, argued, that, the, inquisition, was, not, nearly, as, cruel, or, as, powerful, as, commonly, believed, the, book, was, very, influential, and, largely, responsible, for, subsequent, studies, in, the, 1970s, to, try, to, quantify, from, archival, records, the, inquisition, s, activities, from, 1480, to, 1834, those, studies, showed, there, was, an, initial, burst, of, activity, against, conversos, suspected, of, relapsing, into, judaism, and, a, mid, 16th, century, pursuit, of, protestants, but, according, to, these, studies, the, inquisition, served, principally, as, a, forum, spaniards, occasionally, used, to, humiliate, and, punish, people, they, did, not, like, blasphemers, bigamists, foreigners, and, in, aragon, homosexuals, and, horse, smugglers, kamen, went, on, to, publish, two, more, books, in, 1985, and, 2006, that, incorporated, new, findings, further, supporting, the, view, that, the, inquisition, was, not, as, bad, as, once, described, by, lea, and, others, along, similar, lines, is, edward, peters, s, inquisition, 1988, one, of, the, most, important, works, about, the, inquisition, s, relation, to, the, jewish, conversos, or, new, christians, is, the, origins, of, the, inquisition, in, fifteenth, century, spain, 1995, 2002, by, benzion, netanyahu, it, challenges, the, view, that, most, conversos, were, actually, practicing, judaism, in, secret, and, were, persecuted, for, their, crypto, judaism, rather, according, to, netanyahu, the, persecution, was, fundamentally, racial, and, was, a, matter, of, envy, of, their, success, in, spanish, society, this, view, has, been, challenged, multiple, times, and, with, some, reasonable, divergences, the, majority, of, historians, either, align, with, religious, causes, or, with, merely, cultural, ones, with,
