the, olmecs, l, m, k, s, o, l, were, the, earliest, known, major, mesoamerican, civilization, following, a, progressive, development, in, soconusco, they, occupied, the, tropical, lowlands, of, the, modern, day, mexican, states, of, veracruz, and, tabasco, it, has, been, speculated, that, the, olmecs, derived, in, part, from, the, neighboring, mokaya, or, mixe, zoque, cultures, the, olmecs, flourished, during, mesoamerica, s, formative, period, dating, roughly, from, as, early, as, 1200, bce, to, about, 400, bce, pre, olmec, cultures, had, flourished, since, about, 2500, bce, but, by, 1200, bce, early, olmec, culture, had, emerged, centered, on, the, san, lorenzo, tenochtitl, n, site, near, the, coast, in, southeast, veracruz, they, were, the, first, mesoamerican, civilization, and, laid, many, of, the, foundations, for, the, civilizations, that, followed, among, other, firsts, the, olmec, appeared, to, practice, ritual, bloodletting, and, played, the, mesoamerican, ballgame, hallmarks, of, nearly, all, subsequent, mesoamerican, societies, the, aspect, of, the, olmecs, most, familiar, now, is, their, artwork, particularly, the, colossal, heads, the, olmec, civilization, was, first, defined, through, artifacts, which, collectors, purchased, on, the, pre, columbian, art, market, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, olmec, artworks, are, considered, among, ancient, america, s, most, striking, the, name, olmec, means, rubber, people, in, nahuatl, the, language, of, the, nahuas, and, was, the, aztec, term, for, the, people, who, lived, in, the, gulf, lowlands, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, some, 2, 000, years, after, the, olmec, culture, died, out, the, term, rubber, people, refers, to, the, ancient, practice, spanning, from, ancient, olmecs, to, aztecs, of, extracting, latex, from, castilla, elastica, a, rubber, tree, in, the, area, the, juice, of, a, local, vine, ipomoea, alba, was, then, mixed, with, this, latex, to, create, rubber, as, early, as, 1600, bce, the, nahuatl, word, for, the, olmecs, was, lm, catl, singular, or, lm, cah, plural, this, word, is, composed, of, the, two, words, lli, meaning, natural, rubber, and, m, catl, meaning, people, early, modern, explorers, and, archaeologists, however, mistakenly, applied, the, name, olmec, to, the, rediscovered, ruins, and, artifacts, in, the, heartland, decades, before, it, was, understood, that, these, were, not, created, by, the, people, the, aztecs, knew, as, the, olmec, but, rather, a, culture, that, was, 2000, years, older, despite, the, mistaken, identity, the, name, has, stuck, it, is, not, known, what, name, the, ancient, olmec, used, for, themselves, some, later, mesoamerican, accounts, seem, to, refer, to, the, ancient, olmec, as, tamoanchan, a, contemporary, term, sometimes, used, for, the, olmec, culture, is, tenocelome, meaning, mouth, of, the, jaguar, the, olmec, heartland, is, the, area, in, the, gulf, lowlands, where, it, expanded, after, early, development, in, soconusco, veracruz, this, area, is, characterized, by, swampy, lowlands, punctuated, by, low, hills, ridges, and, volcanoes, the, sierra, de, los, tuxtlas, rises, sharply, in, the, north, along, the, gulf, of, mexico, s, bay, of, campeche, here, the, olmec, constructed, permanent, city, temple, complexes, at, san, lorenzo, tenochtitl, n, la, venta, tres, zapotes, and, laguna, de, los, cerros, in, this, region, the, first, mesoamerican, civilization, emerged, and, reigned, from, c, 1400, 400, bce, the, beginnings, of, olmec, civilization, have, traditionally, been, placed, between, 1400, bce, and, 1200, bce, past, finds, of, olmec, remains, ritually, deposited, at, the, shrine, el, manat, near, the, triple, archaeological, sites, known, collectively, as, san, lorenzo, tenochtitl, n, moved, this, back, to, at, least, 1600, 1500, bce, it, seems, that, the, olmec, had, their, roots, in, early, farming, cultures, of, tabasco, which, began, between, 5100, bce, and, 4600, bce, these, shared, the, same, basic, food, crops, and, technologies, of, the, later, olmec, civilization, what, is, today, called, olmec, first, appeared, fully, within, san, lorenzo, tenochtitl, n, where, distinctive, olmec, features, occurred, around, 1400, bce, the, rise, of, civilization, was, assisted, by, the, local, ecology, of, well, watered, alluvial, soil, as, well, as, by, the, transportation, network, provided, by, the, coatzacoalcos, river, basin, this, environment, may, be, compared, to, that, of, other, ancient, centers, of, civilization, the, nile, indus, and, yellow, river, valleys, and, mesopotamia, this, highly, productive, environment, encouraged, a, densely, concentrated, population, which, in, turn, triggered, the, rise, of, an, elite, class, the, elite, class, created, the, demand, for, the, production, of, the, symbolic, and, sophisticated, luxury, artifacts, that, define, olmec, culture, many, of, these, luxury, artifacts, were, made, from, materials, such, as, jade, obsidian, and, magnetite, which, came, from, distant, locations, and, suggest, that, early, olmec, elites, had, access, to, an, extensive, trading, network, in, mesoamerica, the, source, of, the, most, valued, jade, was, the, motagua, river, valley, in, eastern, guatemala, and, olmec, obsidian, has, been, traced, to, sources, in, the, guatemala, highlands, such, as, el, chayal, and, san, mart, n, jilotepeque, or, in, puebla, distances, ranging, from, 200, to, 400, km, 120, 250, miles, away, respectively, the, state, of, guerrero, and, in, particular, its, early, mezcala, culture, seem, to, have, played, an, important, role, in, the, early, history, of, olmec, culture, olmec, style, artifacts, tend, to, appear, earlier, in, some, parts, of, guerrero, than, in, the, veracruz, tabasco, area, in, particular, the, relevant, objects, from, the, amuco, abelino, site, in, guerrero, reveal, dates, as, early, as, 1530, bce, the, city, of, teopantecuanitlan, in, guerrero, is, also, relevant, in, this, regard, the, first, olmec, center, san, lorenzo, was, all, but, abandoned, around, 900, bce, at, about, the, same, time, that, la, venta, rose, to, prominence, a, wholesale, destruction, of, many, san, lorenzo, monuments, also, occurred, c, 950s, bce, which, may, indicate, an, internal, uprising, or, less, likely, an, invasion, the, latest, thinking, however, is, that, environmental, changes, may, have, been, responsible, for, this, shift, in, olmec, centers, with, certain, important, rivers, changing, course, in, any, case, following, the, decline, of, san, lorenzo, la, venta, became, the, most, prominent, olmec, center, lasting, from, 900, bce, until, its, abandonment, around, 400, bce, la, venta, sustained, the, olmec, cultural, traditions, with, spectacular, displays, of, power, and, wealth, the, great, pyramid, was, the, largest, mesoamerican, structure, of, its, time, even, today, after, 2500, years, of, erosion, it, rises, 34, m, 112, ft, above, the, naturally, flat, landscape, buried, deep, within, la, venta, lay, opulent, labor, intensive, offerings, 1000, tons, of, smooth, serpentine, blocks, large, mosaic, pavements, and, at, least, 48, separate, votive, offerings, of, polished, jade, celts, pottery, figurines, and, hematite, mirrors, scholars, have, yet, to, determine, the, cause, of, the, eventual, extinction, of, the, olmec, culture, between, 400, and, 350, bce, the, population, in, the, eastern, half, of, the, olmec, heartland, dropped, precipitously, and, the, area, was, sparsely, inhabited, until, the, 19th, century, according, to, archaeologists, this, depopulation, was, probably, the, result, of, very, serious, environmental, changes, that, rendered, the, region, unsuited, for, large, groups, of, farmers, in, particular, changes, to, the, riverine, environment, that, the, olmec, depended, upon, for, agriculture, hunting, and, gathering, and, transportation, these, changes, may, have, been, triggered, by, tectonic, upheavals, or, subsidence, or, the, siltation, of, rivers, due, to, agricultural, practices, one, theory, for, the, considerable, population, drop, during, the, terminal, formative, period, is, suggested, by, santley, and, colleagues, santley, et, al, 1997, who, propose, the, relocation, of, settlements, due, to, volcanism, instead, of, extinction, volcanic, eruptions, during, the, early, late, and, terminal, formative, periods, would, have, blanketed, the, lands, and, forced, the, olmec, to, move, their, settlements, whatever, the, cause, within, a, few, hundred, years, of, the, abandonment, of, the, last, olmec, cities, successor, cultures, became, firmly, established, the, tres, zapotes, site, on, the, western, edge, of, the, olmec, heartland, continued, to, be, occupied, well, past, 400, bce, but, without, the, hallmarks, of, the, olmec, culture, this, post, olmec, culture, often, labeled, the, epi, olmec, has, features, similar, to, those, found, at, izapa, some, 550, kilometres, 340, mi, to, the, southeast, the, olmec, culture, was, first, defined, as, an, art, style, and, this, continues, to, be, the, hallmark, of, the, culture, wrought, in, a, large, number, of, media, jade, clay, basalt, and, greenstone, among, others, much, olmec, art, such, as, the, wrestler, is, naturalistic, other, art, expresses, fantastic, anthropomorphic, creatures, often, highly, stylized, using, an, iconography, reflective, of, a, religious, meaning, common, motifs, include, downturned, mouths, and, a, cleft, head, both, of, which, are, seen, in, representations, of, werejaguars, in, addition, to, making, human, and, human, like, subjects, olmec, artisans, were, adept, at, animal, portrayals, while, olmec, figurines, are, found, abundantly, in, sites, throughout, the, formative, period, the, stone, monuments, such, as, the, colossal, heads, are, the, most, recognizable, feature, of, olmec, culture, these, monuments, can, be, divided, into, four, classes, the, most, recognized, aspect, of, the, olmec, civilization, are, the, enormous, helmeted, heads, as, no, known, pre, columbian, text, explains, them, these, impressive, monuments, have, been, the, subject, of, much, speculation, once, theorized, to, be, ballplayers, it, is, now, generally, accepted, that, these, heads, are, portraits, of, rulers, perhaps, dressed, as, ballplayers, infused, with, individuality, no, two, heads, are, alike, and, the, helmet, like, headdresses, are, adorned, with, distinctive, elements, suggesting, personal, or, group, symbols, some, have, also, speculated, that, mesoamerican, people, believed, that, the, soul, along, with, all, of, one, s, experiences, and, emotions, was, contained, inside, the, head, seventeen, colossal, heads, have, been, unearthed, to, date, the, heads, range, in, size, from, the, rancho, la, cobata, head, at, 3, 4, m, 11, ft, high, to, the, pair, at, tres, zapotes, at, 1, 47, m, 4, ft, 10, in, scholars, calculate, that, the, largest, heads, weigh, between, 25, and, 55, tonnes, 28, and, 61, short, tons, the, heads, were, carved, from, single, blocks, or, boulders, of, volcanic, basalt, found, in, the, sierra, de, los, tuxtlas, the, tres, zapotes, heads, for, example, were, sculpted, from, basalt, found, at, the, summit, of, cerro, el, vig, a, at, the, western, end, of, the, tuxtlas, the, san, lorenzo, and, la, venta, heads, on, the, other, hand, were, probably, carved, from, the, basalt, of, cerro, cintepec, on, the, southeastern, side, perhaps, at, the, nearby, llano, del, jicaro, workshop, and, dragged, or, floated, to, their, final, destination, dozens, of, miles, away, it, has, been, estimated, that, moving, a, colossal, head, required, the, efforts, of, 1, 500, people, for, three, to, four, months, some, of, the, heads, and, many, other, monuments, have, been, variously, mutilated, buried, and, disinterred, reset, in, new, locations, and, or, reburied, some, monuments, and, at, least, two, heads, were, recycled, or, recarved, but, it, is, not, known, whether, this, was, simply, due, to, the, scarcity, of, stone, or, whether, these, actions, had, ritual, or, other, connotations, scholars, believe, that, some, mutilation, had, significance, beyond, mere, destruction, but, some, scholars, still, do, not, rule, out, internal, conflicts, or, less, likely, invasion, as, a, factor, the, flat, faced, thick, lipped, heads, have, caused, some, debate, due, to, their, resemblance, to, some, african, facial, characteristics, based, on, this, comparison, some, writers, have, said, that, the, olmecs, were, africans, who, had, emigrated, to, the, new, world, but, the, vast, majority, of, archaeologists, and, other, mesoamerican, scholars, reject, claims, of, pre, columbian, contacts, with, africa, explanations, for, the, facial, features, of, the, colossal, heads, include, the, possibility, that, the, heads, were, carved, in, this, manner, due, to, the, shallow, space, allowed, on, the, basalt, boulders, others, note, that, in, addition, to, the, broad, noses, and, thick, lips, the, eyes, of, the, heads, often, show, the, epicanthic, fold, and, that, all, these, characteristics, can, still, be, found, in, modern, mesoamerican, indians, for, instance, in, the, 1940s, the, artist, art, historian, miguel, covarrubias, published, a, series, of, photos, of, olmec, artwork, and, of, the, faces, of, modern, mexican, indians, with, very, similar, facial, characteristics, the, african, origin, hypothesis, assumes, that, olmec, carving, was, intended, to, be, a, representation, of, the, inhabitants, an, assumption, that, is, hard, to, justify, given, the, full, corpus, of, representation, in, olmec, carving, ivan, van, sertima, claimed, that, the, seven, braids, on, the, tres, zapotes, head, was, an, ethiopian, hair, style, but, he, offered, no, evidence, it, was, a, contemporary, style, the, egyptologist, frank, j, yurco, has, said, that, the, olmec, braids, do, not, resemble, contemporary, egyptian, or, nubian, braids, richard, diehl, wrote, there, can, be, no, doubt, that, the, heads, depict, the, american, indian, physical, type, still, seen, on, the, streets, of, soteapan, acayucan, and, other, towns, in, the, region, another, type, of, artifact, is, much, smaller, hardstone, carvings, in, jade, of, a, face, in, a, mask, form, jade, is, a, particularly, precious, material, and, it, was, used, as, a, mark, of, rank, by, the, ruling, classes, by, 1500, bce, early, olmec, sculptors, mastered, the, human, form, this, can, be, determined, by, wooden, olmec, sculptures, discovered, in, the, swampy, bogs, of, el, manati, before, radiocarbon, dating, could, tell, the, exact, age, of, olmec, pieces, archaeologists, and, art, historians, noticed, the, unique, olmec, style, in, a, variety, of, artifacts, curators, and, scholars, refer, to, olmec, style, face, masks, but, to, date, no, example, has, been, recovered, in, an, archaeologically, controlled, olmec, context, they, have, been, recovered, from, sites, of, other, cultures, including, one, deliberately, deposited, in, the, ceremonial, altepetl, precinct, of, tenochtitlan, in, what, is, now, mexico, city, the, mask, would, presumably, have, been, about, 2000, years, old, when, the, aztecs, buried, it, suggesting, such, masks, were, valued, and, collected, as, were, roman, antiquities, in, europe, the, olmec, style, refers, to, the, combination, of, deep, set, eyes, nostrils, and, strong, slightly, asymmetrical, mouth, the, olmec, style, also, very, distinctly, combines, facial, features, of, both, humans, and, jaguars, olmec, arts, are, strongly, tied, to, the, olmec, religion, which, prominently, featured, jaguars, the, olmec, people, believed, that, in, the, distant, past, a, race, of, werejaguars, was, made, between, the, union, of, a, jaguar, and, a, woman, one, werejaguar, quality, that, can, be, found, is, the, sharp, cleft, in, the, forehead, of, many, supernatural, beings, in, olmec, art, this, sharp, cleft, is, associated, with, the, natural, indented, head, of, jaguars, the, kunz, axes, also, known, as, votive, axes, are, figures, that, represent, werejaguars, and, were, apparently, used, for, rituals, in, most, cases, the, head, is, half, the, total, volume, of, the, figure, all, kunz, axes, have, flat, noses, and, an, open, mouth, the, name, kunz, comes, from, george, frederick, kunz, an, american, mineralogist, who, described, a, figure, in, 1890, olmec, style, artifacts, designs, figurines, monuments, and, iconography, have, been, found, in, the, archaeological, records, of, sites, hundreds, of, kilometres, outside, the, olmec, heartland, these, sites, include, tlatilco, and, tlapacoya, major, centers, of, the, tlatilco, culture, in, the, valley, of, mexico, where, artifacts, include, hollow, baby, face, motif, figurines, and, olmec, designs, on, ceramics, chalcatzingo, in, valley, of, morelos, central, mexico, which, features, olmec, style, monumental, art, and, rock, art, with, olmec, style, figures, also, in, 2007, archaeologists, unearthed, zazacatla, an, olmec, influenced, city, in, morelos, located, about, 40, kilometres, 25, mi, south, of, mexico, city, zazacatla, covered, about, 2, 5, square, kilometres, 1, sq, mi, between, 800, and, 500, bce, teopantecuanitlan, in, guerrero, which, features, olmec, style, monumental, art, as, well, as, city, plans, with, distinctive, olmec, features, also, the, juxtlahuaca, and, oxtotitl, n, cave, paintings, feature, olmec, designs, and, motifs, olmec, influence, is, also, seen, at, several, sites, in, the, southern, maya, area, in, guatemala, sites, showing, probable, olmec, influence, include, san, bartolo, takalik, abaj, and, la, democracia, many, theories, have, been, advanced, to, account, for, the, occurrence, of, olmec, influence, far, outside, the, heartland, including, long, range, trade, by, olmec, merchants, olmec, colonization, of, other, regions, olmec, artisans, travelling, to, other, cities, conscious, imitation, of, olmec, artistic, styles, by, developing, towns, some, even, suggest, the, prospect, of, olmec, military, domination, or, that, the, olmec, iconography, was, actually, developed, outside, the, heartland, the, generally, accepted, but, by, no, means, unanimous, interpretation, is, that, the, olmec, style, artifacts, in, all, sizes, became, associated, with, elite, status, and, were, adopted, by, non, olmec, formative, period, chieftains, in, an, effort, to, bolster, their, status, in, addition, to, their, influence, with, contemporaneous, mesoamerican, cultures, as, the, first, civilization, in, mesoamerica, the, olmecs, are, credited, or, speculatively, credited, with, many, firsts, including, the, bloodletting, and, perhaps, human, sacrifice, writing, and, epigraphy, and, the, invention, of, popcorn, zero, and, the, mesoamerican, calendar, and, the, mesoamerican, ballgame, as, well, as, perhaps, the, compass, some, researchers, including, artist, and, art, historian, miguel, covarrubias, even, postulate, that, the, olmecs, formulated, the, forerunners, of, many, of, the, later, mesoamerican, deities, although, the, archaeological, record, does, not, include, explicit, representation, of, olmec, bloodletting, researchers, have, found, other, evidence, that, the, olmec, ritually, practiced, it, for, example, numerous, natural, and, ceramic, stingray, spikes, and, maguey, thorns, have, been, found, at, olmec, sites, and, certain, artifacts, have, been, identified, as, bloodletters, the, argument, that, the, olmec, instituted, human, sacrifice, is, significantly, more, speculative, no, olmec, or, olmec, influenced, sacrificial, artifacts, have, yet, been, discovered, no, olmec, or, olmec, influenced, artwork, unambiguously, shows, sacrificial, victims, as, do, the, danzante, figures, of, monte, alb, n, or, scenes, of, human, sacrifice, such, as, can, be, seen, in, the, famous, ballcourt, mural, from, el, taj, n, at, el, manat, disarticulated, skulls, and, femurs, as, well, as, the, complete, skeletons, of, newborns, or, fetuses, have, been, discovered, amidst, the, other, offerings, leading, to, speculation, concerning, infant, sacrifice, scholars, have, not, determined, how, the, infants, met, their, deaths, some, authors, have, associated, infant, sacrifice, with, olmec, ritual, art, showing, limp, werejaguar, babies, most, famously, in, la, venta, s, altar, 5, on, the, right, or, las, limas, figure, any, definitive, answer, requires, further, findings, the, olmec, may, have, been, the, first, civilization, in, the, western, hemisphere, to, develop, a, writing, system, symbols, found, in, 2002, and, 2006, date, from, 650, bce, and, 900, bce, respectively, preceding, the, oldest, zapotec, writing, found, so, far, which, dates, from, about, 500, bce, the, 2002, find, at, the, san, andr, s, site, shows, a, bird, speech, scrolls, and, glyphs, that, are, similar, to, the, later, maya, script, known, as, the, cascajal, block, and, dated, between, 1100, and, 900, bce, the, 2006, find, from, a, site, near, san, lorenzo, shows, a, set, of, 62, symbols, 28, of, which, are, unique, carved, on, a, serpentine, block, a, large, number, of, prominent, archaeologists, have, hailed, this, find, as, the, earliest, pre, columbian, writing, others, are, skeptical, because, of, the, stone, s, singularity, the, fact, that, it, had, been, removed, from, any, archaeological, context, and, because, it, bears, no, apparent, resemblance, to, any, other, mesoamerican, writing, system, there, are, also, well, documented, later, hieroglyphs, known, as, the, isthmian, script, and, while, there, are, some, who, believe, that, the, isthmian, may, represent, a, transitional, script, between, an, earlier, olmec, writing, system, and, the, maya, script, the, matter, remains, unsettled, the, long, count, calendar, used, by, many, subsequent, mesoamerican, civilizations, as, well, as, the, concept, of, zero, may, have, been, devised, by, the, olmecs, because, the, six, artifacts, with, the, earliest, long, count, calendar, dates, were, all, discovered, outside, the, immediate, maya, homeland, it, is, likely, that, this, calendar, predated, the, maya, and, was, possibly, the, invention, of, the, olmecs, indeed, three, of, these, six, artifacts, were, found, within, the, olmec, heartland, but, an, argument, against, an, olmec, origin, is, the, fact, that, the, olmec, civilization, had, ended, by, the, 4th, century, bce, several, centuries, before, the, earliest, known, long, count, date, artifact, the, long, count, calendar, required, the, use, of, zero, as, a, place, holder, within, its, vigesimal, base, 20, positional, numeral, system, a, shell, glyph, was, used, as, a, zero, symbol, for, these, long, count, dates, the, second, oldest, of, which, on, stela, c, at, tres, zapotes, has, a, date, of, 32, bce, this, is, one, of, the, earliest, uses, of, the, zero, concept, in, history, the, olmec, are, strong, candidates, for, originating, the, mesoamerican, ballgame, so, prevalent, among, later, cultures, of, the, region, and, used, for, recreational, and, religious, purposes, a, dozen, rubber, balls, dating, to, 1600, bce, or, earlier, have, been, found, in, el, manat, a, bog, 10, km, 6, mi, east, of, san, lorenzo, tenochtitlan, these, balls, predate, the, earliest, ballcourt, yet, discovered, at, paso, de, la, amada, c, 1400, bce, although, there, is, no, certainty, that, they, were, used, in, the, ballgame, while, the, actual, ethno, linguistic, affiliation, of, the, olmec, remains, unknown, various, hypotheses, have, been, put, forward, for, example, in, 1968, michael, d, coe, speculated, that, the, olmec, were, maya, predecessors, in, 1976, linguists, lyle, campbell, and, terrence, kaufman, published, a, paper, in, which, they, argued, a, core, number, of, loanwords, had, apparently, spread, from, a, mixe, zoquean, language, into, many, other, mesoamerican, languages, campbell, and, kaufman, proposed, that, the, presence, of, these, core, loanwords, indicated, that, the, olmec, generally, regarded, as, the, first, highly, civilized, mesoamerican, society, spoke, a, language, ancestral, to, mixe, zoquean, the, spread, of, this, vocabulary, particular, to, their, culture, accompanied, the, diffusion, of, other, olmec, cultural, and, artistic, traits, that, appears, in, the, archaeological, record, of, other, mesoamerican, societies, mixe, zoque, specialist, s, ren, wichmann, first, critiqued, this, theory, on, the, basis, that, most, of, the, mixe, zoquean, loans, seemed, to, originate, only, from, the, zoquean, branch, of, the, family, this, implied, the, loanword, transmission, occurred, in, the, period, after, the, two, branches, of, the, language, family, split, placing, the, time, of, the, borrowings, outside, of, the, olmec, period, however, new, evidence, has, pushed, back, the, proposed, date, for, the, split, of, mixean, and, zoquean, languages, to, a, period, within, the, olmec, era, based, on, this, dating, the, architectural, and, archaeological, patterns, and, the, particulars, of, the, vocabulary, loaned, to, other, mesoamerican, languages, from, mixe, zoquean, wichmann, now, suggests, that, the, olmecs, of, san, lorenzo, spoke, proto, mixe, and, the, olmecs, of, la, venta, spoke, proto, zoque, at, least, the, fact, that, the, mixe, zoquean, languages, are, still, spoken, in, an, area, corresponding, roughly, to, the, olmec, heartland, and, are, historically, known, to, have, been, spoken, there, leads, most, scholars, to, assume, that, the, olmec, spoke, one, or, more, mixe, zoquean, languages, olmec, religious, activities, were, performed, by, a, combination, of, rulers, full, time, priests, and, shamans, the, rulers, seem, to, have, been, the, most, important, religious, figures, with, their, links, to, the, olmec, deities, or, supernaturals, providing, legitimacy, for, their, rule, there, is, also, considerable, evidence, for, shamans, in, the, olmec, archaeological, record, particularly, in, the, so, called, transformation, figures, as, no, documentations, of, olmec, religious, narratives, and, figures, comparable, to, the, popol, vuh, has, been, left, or, found, any, interpretation, of, olmec, religious, narratives, and, figures, must, be, based, on, interpretations, of, surviving, monumental, and, portable, art, such, as, the, se, or, de, las, limas, statue, at, the, xalapa, museum, and, comparisons, with, other, seemingly, similar, elements, found, throughout, nearby, mesoamerican, cultures, olmec, art, shows, that, such, deities, as, feathered, serpent, and, a, supernatural, rain, were, already, in, the, mesoamerican, pantheon, in, olmec, times, little, is, directly, known, about, the, societal, or, political, structure, of, olmec, society, although, it, is, assumed, by, most, researchers, that, the, colossal, heads, and, several, other, sculptures, represent, rulers, nothing, has, been, found, like, the, maya, stelae, which, name, specific, rulers, and, provide, the, dates, of, their, rule, instead, archaeologists, relied, on, the, data, that, they, had, such, as, large, and, small, scale, site, surveys, these, provided, evidence, of, considerable, centralization, within, the, olmec, region, first, at, san, lorenzo, and, then, at, la, venta, no, other, olmec, sites, come, close, to, these, in, terms, of, area, or, in, the, quantity, and, quality, of, architecture, and, sculpture, this, evidence, of, geographic, and, demographic, centralization, leads, archaeologists, to, propose, that, olmec, society, itself, was, hierarchical, concentrated, first, at, san, lorenzo, and, then, at, la, venta, with, an, elite, that, was, able, to, use, their, control, over, materials, such, as, water, and, monumental, stone, to, exert, command, and, legitimize, their, regime, nonetheless, olmec, society, is, thought, to, lack, many, of, the, institutions, of, later, civilizations, such, as, a, standing, army, or, priestly, caste, and, there, is, no, evidence, that, san, lorenzo, or, la, venta, controlled, even, during, their, heyday, all, of, the, olmec, heartland, there, is, some, doubt, for, example, that, la, venta, controlled, even, arroyo, sonso, only, some, 35, km, 22, mi, away, studies, of, the, sierra, de, los, tuxtlas, settlements, some, 60, km, 35, mi, away, indicate, that, this, area, was, composed, of, more, or, less, egalitarian, communities, outside, the, control, of, lowland, centers, the, wide, diffusion, of, olmec, artifacts, and, olmecoid, iconography, throughout, much, of, mesoamerica, indicates, the, existence, of, extensive, long, distance, trade, networks, exotic, prestigious, and, high, value, materials, such, as, greenstone, and, marine, shell, were, moved, in, significant, quantities, across, large, distances, some, of, the, reasons, for, trade, revolve, around, the, lack, of, obsidian, in, the, heartland, the, olmec, used, obsidian, in, many, tools, because, worked, edges, were, very, sharp, and, durable, most, of, the, obsidian, found, has, been, traced, back, to, guatemala, showing, the, extensive, trade, while, the, olmec, were, not, the, first, in, mesoamerica, to, organize, long, distance, exchanges, of, goods, the, olmec, period, saw, a, significant, expansion, in, interregional, trade, routes, more, variety, in, material, goods, exchanged, and, a, greater, diversity, in, the, sources, from, which, the, base, materials, were, obtained, despite, their, size, and, deliberate, urban, design, which, was, copied, by, other, centers, san, lorenzo, and, la, venta, were, largely, ceremonial, centers, and, the, majority, of, the, olmec, lived, in, villages, similar, to, present, day, villages, and, hamlets, in, tabasco, and, veracruz, these, villages, were, located, on, higher, ground, and, consisted, of, several, scattered, houses, a, modest, temple, may, have, been, associated, with, the, larger, villages, the, individual, dwellings, would, consist, of, a, house, an, associated, lean, to, and, one, or, more, storage, pits, similar, in, function, to, a, root, cellar, a, nearby, garden, was, used, for, medicinal, and, cooking, herbs, and, for, smaller, crops, such, as, the, domesticated, sunflower, fruit, trees, such, as, avocado, or, cacao, were, probably, available, nearby, although, the, river, banks, were, used, to, plant, crops, between, flooding, periods, the, olmecs, probably, also, practiced, slash, and, burn, agriculture, to, clear, the, forests, and, shrubs, and, to, provide, new, fields, once, the, old, fields, were, exhausted, fields, were, located, outside, the, village, and, were, used, for, maize, beans, squash, cassava, and, sweet, potato, based, on, archaeological, studies, of, two, villages, in, the, tuxtlas, mountains, it, is, known, that, maize, cultivation, became, increasingly, important, to, the, olmec, over, time, although, the, diet, remained, fairly, diverse, the, fruits, and, vegetables, were, supplemented, with, fish, turtle, snake, and, mollusks, from, the, nearby, rivers, and, crabs, and, shellfish, in, the, coastal, areas, birds, were, available, as, food, sources, as, were, game, including, peccary, opossum, raccoon, rabbit, and, in, particular, deer, despite, the, wide, range, of, hunting, and, fishing, available, midden, surveys, in, san, lorenzo, have, found, that, the, domesticated, dog, was, the, single, most, plentiful, source, of, animal, protein, olmec, culture, was, unknown, to, historians, until, the, mid, 19th, century, in, 1869, the, mexican, antiquarian, traveller, jos, melgar, y, serrano, published, a, description, of, the, first, olmec, monument, to, have, been, found, in, situ, this, monument, the, colossal, head, now, labelled, tres, zapotes, monument, a, had, been, discovered, in, the, late, 1850s, by, a, farm, worker, clearing, forested, land, on, a, hacienda, in, veracruz, hearing, about, the, curious, find, while, travelling, through, the, region, melgar, y, serrano, first, visited, the, site, in, 1862, to, see, for, himself, and, complete, the, partially, exposed, sculpture, s, excavation, his, description, of, the, object, published, several, years, later, after, further, visits, to, the, site, represents, the, earliest, documented, report, of, an, artifact, of, what, is, now, known, as, the, olmec, culture, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, olmec, artifacts, such, as, the, kunz, axe, right, came, to, light, and, were, subsequently, recognized, as, belonging, to, a, unique, artistic, tradition, frans, blom, and, oliver, la, farge, made, the, first, detailed, descriptions, of, la, venta, and, san, martin, pajapan, monument, 1, during, their, 1925, expedition, however, at, this, time, most, archaeologists, assumed, the, olmec, were, contemporaneous, with, the, maya, even, blom, and, la, farge, were, in, their, own, words, inclined, to, ascribe, them, to, the, maya, culture, matthew, stirling, of, the, smithsonian, institution, conducted, the, first, detailed, scientific, excavations, of, olmec, sites, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, stirling, along, with, art, historian, miguel, covarrubias, became, convinced, that, the, olmec, predated, most, other, known, mesoamerican, civilizations, in, counterpoint, to, stirling, covarrubias, and, alfonso, caso, however, mayanists, j, eric, thompson, and, sylvanus, morley, argued, for, classic, era, dates, for, the, olmec, artifacts, the, question, of, olmec, chronology, came, to, a, head, at, a, 1942, tuxtla, gutierrez, conference, where, alfonso, caso, declared, that, the, olmecs, were, the, mother, culture, cultura, madre, of, mesoamerica, shortly, after, the, conference, radiocarbon, dating, proved, the, antiquity, of, the, olmec, civilization, although, the, mother, culture, question, generated, considerable, debate, even, 60, years, later, in, the, investigations, of, the, san, lorenzo, tenochtitl, n, archaeological, project, at, the, sites, of, san, lorenzo, and, loma, del, zapote, several, human, burials, from, the, olmec, period, were, found, the, bone, consistency, in, two, of, them, allowed, the, study, of, their, mitochondrial, dna, to, be, carried, out, successfully, as, part, of, an, investigation, that, proposes, the, comparative, analysis, of, the, genetic, information, of, the, olmecs, with, that, obtained, from, subjects, from, other, mesoamerican, societies, under, the, advice, of, the, specialists, dr, mar, a, de, lourdes, mu, oz, moreno, and, miguel, moreno, galeana, both, at, cinvestav, in, mexico, this, pioneering, study, of, mitochondrial, dna, in, 2018, was, carried, out, on, two, olmec, individuals, one, from, san, lorenzo, and, the, other, from, loma, del, zapote, resulted, in, both, cases, in, the, unequivocal, presence, of, the, distinctive, mutations, of, the, haplogroup, a, maternal, lineage, they, share, the, most, abundant, of, the, five, mitochondrial, haplogroups, characteristic, of, the, indigenous, populations, of, the, americas, a, b, c, d, and, x, partly, because, the, olmecs, developed, the, first, mesoamerican, civilization, and, partly, because, little, is, known, of, them, compared, to, for, example, the, maya, or, aztec, a, number, of, olmec, alternative, origin, speculations, have, been, put, forth, although, several, of, these, speculations, particularly, the, theory, that, the, olmecs, were, of, african, origin, popularized, by, ivan, van, sertima, s, book, they, came, before, columbus, have, become, well, known, within, popular, culture, they, are, not, considered, credible, by, the, vast, majority, of, mesoamerican, researchers, and, scientists, who, discard, them, as, pop, culture, pseudo, science, as, of, 2018, mitochondrial, dna, studies, carried, out, on, olmec, remains, one, from, san, lorenzo, and, the, other, from, loma, del, zapote, resulted, in, both, cases, in, the, unequivocal, presence, of, the, distinctive, mutations, of, the, a, maternal, lineage, that, is, the, maternal, ancestry, of, the, olmecs, is, not, in, africa, but, in, america, since, they, share, the, most, abundant, of, the, five, mitochondrial, haplogroups, characteristic, of, the, indigenous, populations, of, the, continent, a, b, c, d, and, x, in, a, certain, era, which, no, one, can, reckon, which, no, one, can, remember, there, was, a, government, for, a, long, time
