from, the, first, dynasty, c, 3150, bce, until, the, annexation, of, egypt, by, the, roman, republic, in, 30, bce, however, regardless, of, gender, king, was, the, term, used, most, frequently, by, the, ancient, egyptians, for, their, monarchs, through, the, middle, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, during, the, new, kingdom, the, earliest, confirmed, instances, of, pharaoh, used, contemporaneously, for, a, ruler, were, a, letter, to, akhenaten, reigned, c, 1353, 1336, bce, or, an, inscription, possibly, referring, to, thutmose, iii, c, 1479, 1425, bce, in, the, early, dynasties, ancient, egyptian, kings, had, as, many, as, three, titles, the, horus, the, sedge, and, bee, nswt, bjtj, and, the, two, ladies, or, nebty, nbtj, name, the, golden, horus, and, the, nomen, and, prenomen, titles, were, added, later, in, egyptian, society, religion, was, central, to, everyday, life, one, of, the, roles, of, the, king, was, as, an, intermediary, between, the, deities, and, the, people, the, king, thus, was, deputised, for, the, deities, in, a, role, that, was, both, as, civil, and, religious, administrator, the, king, owned, all, of, the, land, in, egypt, enacted, laws, collected, taxes, and, served, as, commander, in, chief, of, the, military, religiously, the, king, officiated, over, religious, ceremonies, and, chose, the, sites, of, new, temples, the, king, was, responsible, for, maintaining, maat, m, t, or, cosmic, order, balance, and, justice, and, part, of, this, included, going, to, war, when, necessary, to, defend, the, country, or, attacking, others, when, it, was, believed, that, this, would, contribute, to, maat, such, as, to, obtain, resources, during, the, early, days, prior, to, the, unification, of, upper, and, lower, egypt, the, deshret, or, the, red, crown, was, a, representation, of, the, kingdom, of, lower, egypt, while, the, hedjet, the, white, crown, was, worn, by, the, kings, of, upper, egypt, after, the, unification, of, both, kingdoms, the, pschent, the, combination, of, both, the, red, and, white, crowns, became, the, official, crown, of, the, pharaoh, with, time, new, headdresses, were, introduced, during, different, dynasties, such, as, the, khat, nemes, atef, hemhem, crown, and, khepresh, at, times, a, combination, of, these, headdresses, or, crowns, worn, together, was, depicted, the, word, pharaoh, ultimately, derives, from, the, egyptian, compound, pr, pa, uw, a, great, house, written, with, the, two, biliteral, hieroglyphs, pr, house, and, column, here, meaning, great, or, high, it, was, the, title, of, the, royal, palace, and, was, used, only, in, larger, phrases, such, as, smr, pr, courtier, of, the, high, house, with, specific, reference, to, the, buildings, of, the, court, or, palace, from, the, twelfth, dynasty, onward, the, word, appears, in, a, wish, formula, great, house, may, it, live, prosper, and, be, in, health, but, again, only, with, reference, to, the, royal, palace, and, not, a, person, sometime, during, the, era, of, the, new, kingdom, pharaoh, became, the, form, of, address, for, a, person, who, was, king, the, earliest, confirmed, instance, where, pr, is, used, specifically, to, address, the, ruler, is, in, a, letter, to, the, eighteenth, dynasty, king, akhenaten, reigned, c, 1353, 1336, bce, that, is, addressed, to, great, house, l, w, h, the, lord, however, there, is, a, possibility, that, the, title, pr, first, might, have, been, applied, personally, to, thutmose, iii, c, 1479, 1425, bce, depending, on, whether, an, inscription, on, the, temple, of, armant, may, be, confirmed, to, refer, to, that, king, during, the, eighteenth, dynasty, sixteenth, to, fourteenth, centuries, bce, the, title, pharaoh, was, employed, as, a, reverential, designation, of, the, ruler, about, the, late, twenty, first, dynasty, tenth, century, bce, however, instead, of, being, used, alone, and, originally, just, for, the, palace, it, began, to, be, added, to, the, other, titles, before, the, name, of, the, king, and, from, the, twenty, fifth, dynasty, eighth, to, seventh, centuries, bce, during, the, declining, third, intermediate, period, it, was, at, least, in, ordinary, use, the, only, epithet, prefixed, to, the, royal, appellative, from, the, nineteenth, dynasty, onward, pr, on, its, own, was, used, as, regularly, as, m, majesty, the, term, therefore, evolved, from, a, word, specifically, referring, to, a, building, to, a, respectful, designation, for, the, ruler, presiding, in, that, building, particularly, by, the, time, of, the, twenty, second, dynasty, and, twenty, third, dynasty, the, first, dated, appearance, of, the, title, pharaoh, being, attached, to, a, ruler, s, name, occurs, in, year, 17, of, siamun, tenth, century, bce, on, a, fragment, from, the, karnak, priestly, annals, a, religious, document, here, an, induction, of, an, individual, to, the, amun, priesthood, is, dated, specifically, to, the, reign, of, pharaoh, siamun, this, new, practice, was, continued, under, his, successor, psusennes, ii, and, the, subsequent, kings, of, the, twenty, second, dynasty, for, instance, the, large, dakhla, stela, is, specifically, dated, to, year, 5, of, king, pharaoh, shoshenq, beloved, of, amun, whom, all, egyptologists, concur, was, shoshenq, i, the, founder, of, the, twenty, second, dynasty, including, alan, gardiner, in, his,

official, egyptian, narratives, the, title, is, reconstructed, to, have, been, pronounced, in, the, late, egyptian, language, from, which, the, greek, historian, herodotus, derived, the, name, of, one, of, the, egyptian, kings, koin, greek, in, the, hebrew, bible, the, title, also, occurs, as, hebrew, from, that, in, the, septuagint, koin, greek, romanized, phara, and, then, in, late, latin,

both, kings, and, deities, the, flail, later, was, closely, related, to, the, heqa, scepter, the, crook, and, flail, but, in, early, representations, the, king, was, also, depicted, solely, with, the, flail, as, shown, in, a, late, pre, dynastic, knife, handle, that, is, now, in, the, metropolitan, museum, and, on, the, narmer, macehead, the, earliest, evidence, known, of, the, uraeus, a, rearing, cobra, is, from, the, reign, of, den, from, the, first, dynasty, the, cobra, supposedly, protected, the, king, by, spitting, fire, at, its, enemies, the, red, crown, of, lower, egypt, the, deshret, crown, dates, back, to, pre, dynastic, times, and, symbolised, chief, ruler, a, red, crown, has, been, found, on, a, pottery, shard, from, naqada, and, later, narmer, is, shown, wearing, the, red, crown, on, both, the, narmer, macehead, and, the, narmer, palette, the, white, crown, of, upper, egypt, the, hedjet, was, worn, in, the, predynastic, period, by, scorpion, ii, and, later, by, narmer, this, is, the, combination, of, the, deshret, and, hedjet, crowns, into, a, double, crown, called, the, pschent, crown, it, is, first, documented, in, the, middle, of, the, first, dynasty, of, egypt, the, earliest, depiction, may, date, to, the, reign, of, djet, and, is, otherwise, surely, attested, during, the, reign, of, den, the, khat, headdress, consists, of, a, kind, of, kerchief, whose, end, is, tied, similarly, to, a, ponytail, the, earliest, depictions, of, the, khat, headdress, comes, from, the, reign, of, den, but, is, not, found, again, until, the, reign, of, djoser, the, nemes, headdress, dates, from, the, time, of, djoser, it, is, the, most, common, type, of, royal, headgear, depicted, throughout, pharaonic, egypt, any, other, type, of, crown, apart, from, the, khat, headdress, has, been, commonly, depicted, on, top, of, the, nemes, the, statue, from, his, serdab, in, saqqara, shows, the, king, wearing, the, nemes, headdress, osiris, is, shown, to, wear, the,

depicted, being, worn, in, battle, but, it, was, also, frequently, worn, during, ceremonies, it, used, to, be, called, a, war, crown, by, many, but, modern, historians, refrain, from, defining, it, thus, egyptologist, bob, brier, has, noted, that, despite, their, widespread, depiction, in, royal, portraits, no, ancient, egyptian, crown, has, ever, been, discovered, the, tomb, of, tutankhamun, that, was, discovered, largely, intact, contained, such, royal, regalia, as, a, crook, and, flail, but, no, crown, was, found, among, his, funerary, equipment, diadems, have, been, discovered, it, is, presumed, that, crowns, would, have, been, believed, to, have, magical, properties, and, were, used, in, rituals, brier, s, speculation, is, that, crowns, were, religious, or, state, items, so, a, dead, king, likely, could, not, retain, a, crown, as, a, personal, possession, the, crowns, may, have, been, passed, along, to, the, successor, much, as, the, crowns, of, modern, monarchies, during, the, early, dynastic, period, kings, had, three, titles, the, horus, name, is, the, oldest, and, dates, to, the, late, pre, dynastic, period, the, nesu, bity, name, was, added, during, the, first,

were, introduced, later, and, are, traditionally, enclosed, in, a, cartouche, by, the, middle, kingdom, the, official, titulary, of, the, ruler, consisted, of, five, names, horus, nebty, golden, horus, nomen, and, prenomen, for, some, rulers, only, one, or, two, of, them, may, be, known, the, horus, name, was, adopted, by, the, king, when, taking, the, throne, the, name, was, written, within, a, square, frame, representing, the, palace, named, a, serekh, the, earliest, known, example, of, a, serekh, dates, to, the, reign, of, king, ka, before, the, first, dynasty, the, horus, name, of, several, early, kings, expresses, a, relationship, with, horus, aha, refers, to, horus, the, fighter, djer, refers, to, horus, the, strong, etc, later, kings, express, ideals, of, kingship, in, their, horus, names, khasekhemwy, refers, to, horus, the, two, powers, are, at, peace, while, nebra, refers, to, horus, lord, of, the, sun, the, nesu, bity, name, also, known, as, prenomen, was, one, of, the, new, developments, from, the, reign, of, den, the, name, would, follow, the, glyphs, for, the, sedge, and, the, bee, the, title, is, usually, translated, as, king, of, upper, and, lower, egypt, the, nsw, bity, name, may, have, been, the, birth, name, of, the, king, it, was, often, the, name, by, which, kings, were, recorded, in, the, later, annals, and, king, lists, the, earliest, example, of, a, nebty, two, ladies, name, comes, from, the, reign, of, king, aha, from, the, first, dynasty, the, title, links, the, king, with, the, goddesses, of, upper, and, lower, egypt, nekhbet, and,

falcon, on, a, gold, or, nbw, sign, the, title, may, have, represented, the, divine, status, of, the, king, the, horus, associated, with, gold, may, be, referring, to, the, idea, that, the, bodies, of, the, deities, were, made, of, gold, and, the, pyramids, and, obelisks, are, representations, of, golden, sun, rays, the, gold, sign, may, also, be, a, reference, to, nubt, the, city, of, set, this, would, suggest, that, the, iconography, represents, horus, conquering, set, the, prenomen, and, nomen, were, contained, in, a, cartouche, the, prenomen, often, followed, the, king, of, upper,

divine, kingship, would, go, on, to, influence, many, other, societies, and, kingdoms, surviving, into, the, modern, era, the, pharaoh, also, became, a, mediator, between, the, gods, and, man, this, institution, represents, an, innovation, over, that, of, sumerian, city, states, where, though, the, clan, leader, or, king, mediated, between, his, people, and, the, gods, did, not, himself, represent, a, god, on, earth, the, few, sumerian, exceptions, to, this, would, post, date, the, origins, of, this, practice, in, ancient, egypt, for, example, the, legendary, king, gilgamesh, thought, to, have, reigned, in, uruk, as, a, contemporary, of, the, egyptian, ruler, djoser, was, cast, as, having, had, his, mother, as, the, mesopotamian, goddess, ninsun, alongside, his, father, the, previous, human, ruler, of, uruk, another, mesopotamian, example, of, a, god, king, was, naram, sin, of, akkad, during, the, early, dynastic, period, the, pharaoh, was, represented, as, the, divine, incarnation, of, horus, and, the, unifier, of, upper, and, lower, egypt, by, the, time, of, djedefre, 26th, century, bce, the, pharaoh, also, ceased, to, have, a, father, as, his, mother, was, magically, impregnated, by, the, solar, deity, ra, according, to, pyramid, text, utterance, 571, the, king, was, fashioned, by, his, father, atum, before, the, sky, existed, before, earth, existed, before, men, existed, before, the, gods, were, born, before, death, existed, according, to, an, inscription, on, the, statue, of, horemheb, 14th, 13th, centuries, bce, he, already, came, out, of, his, mother, s, bosom, adorned, with, the, prestige, and, the, divine, color, inscriptions, regularly, described, the, pharaoh, as, the, good, god, or, perfect, god, nfr, ntr, by, the, time, of, the, new, kingdom, the, divinity, of, the, king, was, imbued, as, he, possessed, the, manifestation, of, the, god, amun, re, this, was, referred, to, as, his, living, royal, ka, which, he, received, during, the, coronation, ceremony, the, divinity, of, pharaoh, was, still, held, to, during, the, period, of, persian, domination, of, egypt, the, persian, emperor, darius, the, great, 522, 486, bce, was, referred, to, as, a, divine, being, in, egyptian, temple, texts, such, descriptions, continued, and, were, designated, to, alexander, the, great, after, his, conquest, of, egypt, and, later, still, for, the, rulers, of, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, that, succeeded, alexander, s, rule, descriptions, of, the, divinity, of, the, pharaoh, are, much, more, infrequent, in, sources, from, classical, greece, one, ptolemaic, era, hymn, describes, the, divinity, of, the, pharaoh, though, this, may, reflect, greek, notions, of, divine, kingship, just, as, much, as, it, could, reflect, egyptian, ones, the, historian, herodotus, explicitly, denies, this, claiming, that, egyptian, priests, rejected, any, notion, of, the, divinity, of, the, king, the, only, explicit, classical, greek, source, which, describes, the, divinity, of, pharaoh, is, contained, in, the, writings, of, diodorus, siculus, in, the, 1st, century, bce, who, in, turn, relies, on, hecataeus, of, abdera, as, his, source, of, information, diodorus, slightly, contradicts, himself, in, a, different, passage, where, he, asserts, that, darius, i, was, the, first, ruler, of, egypt, to, be, honored, as, a, king, even, after, the, reign, of, the, egyptian, kings, and, pharaohs, the, notion, of, pharaoh, s, self, notion, as, a, divine, being, survived, and, is, described, in, rabbinic, literature, in, these, sources, the, pharaoh, is, described, as, hubristically, asserting, his, own, divinity, and, yet, compared, to, the, one, true, god, is, no, more, than, an, impotent, human, genesis, rabbah, 89, 3, invokes, pharaoh, describing, himself, as, the, god, over, the, nile, river, in, exodus, rabbah, 10, 2, pharaoh, boasts, that, he, is, the, creator, and, owner, of, the, nile, god, is, then, said, to, have, responded, to, this, statement, by, challenging, the, pharaoh, over, who, owns, the, nile, as, god, proceeds, to, create, a, disaster, by, bringing, forth, frogs, from, it, that, consume, egypt, s, agriculture, in, other, midrashic, texts, pharaoh, asserts, himself, as, the, creator, of, the, universe, and, even, of, himself, in, the, tanhuma, in, commentary, on, ezekiel, 29, 9, pharaoh, is, said, to, have, proclaimed, himself, as, lord, of, the, universe, pharaoh, is, represented, as, a, heretical, figure, who, presents, himself, as, divine, and, these, texts, then, claim, that, his, claims, were, exposed, when, he, had, to, go, to, the, nile, to, relieve, himself
