italic, peoples, and, rose, to, dominate, western, europe, northern, africa, and, the, near, east, after, the, assassination, of, julius, caesar, the, roman, empire, dominated, western, europe, and, the, mediterranean, for, centuries, contributing, to, the, development, of, western, culture, philosophy, science, and, art, with, the, fall, of, rome, in, ad, 476, italy, was, fragmented, into, numerous, city, states, and, regional, polities, a, situation, that, would, remain, until, the, complete, unification, of, the, country, in, 1871, the, maritime, republics, in, particular, venice, and, genoa, rose, to, prosperity, central, italy, remained, under, the, papal, states, while, southern, italy, remained, largely, feudal, due, to, a, succession, of, byzantine, arab, norman, spanish, and, bourbon, crowns, the, italian, renaissance, spread, to, the, rest, of, europe, bringing, a, renewed, interest, in, humanism, science, exploration, and, art, with, the, start, of, the, modern, era, by, the, mid, 19th, century, italian, unification, led, by, the, house, of, savoy, led, to, the, establishment, of, an, italian, nation, state, the, new, kingdom, of, italy, quickly, modernized, and, built, a, colonial, empire, controlling, parts, of, africa, and, countries, along, the, mediterranean, at, the, same, time, southern, italy, remained, rural, and, poor, originating, the, italian, diaspora, in, world, war, i, italy, completed, the, unification, by, acquiring, trento, and, trieste, and, gained, a, permanent, seat, in, the, league, of, nations, s, executive, council, italian, nationalists, considered, world, war, i, a, mutilated, victory, because, italy, did, not, have, all, the, territories, promised, by, the, treaty, of, london, 1915, and, that, sentiment, led, to, the, rise, of, the, fascist, dictatorship, of, benito, mussolini, in, 1922, during, world, war, ii, italy, was, part, of, the, axis, powers, until, the, italian, surrender, to, allied, powers, and, its,

economic, boom, and, co, founded, the, european, union, treaty, of, rome, nato, and, the, group, of, six, later, g7, and, g20, the, arrival, of, the, first, hominins, was, 850, 000, years, ago, at, monte, poggiolo, the, presence, of, the, homo, neanderthalensis, has, been, demonstrated, in, archaeological, findings, near, rome, and, verona, dating, to, c, 50, 000, years, ago, late, pleistocene, homo, sapiens, sapiens, appeared, during, the, upper, palaeolithic, remains, of, the, later, prehistoric, age, include, tzi, the, iceman, dating, to, c, 3400, 3100, bc, copper, age, during, the, copper, age, indoeuropean, people, migrated, to, italy, in, four, waves, a, first, indoeuropean, migration, occurred, around, the, mid, 3rd, millennium, bc, from, a, population, who, imported, coppersmithing, the, remedello, culture, took, over, the, po, valley, the, second, wave, occurred, in, the, bronze, age, from, the, late, 3rd, to, the, early, 2nd, millennium, bc, with, tribes, identified, with, the, beaker, culture, and, by, the, use, of, bronze, smithing, in, the, padan, plain, in, tuscany, and, on, the, coasts, of, sardinia, and, sicily, in, the, mid, 2nd, millennium, bc, a, third, wave, arrived, associated, with, the, apenninian, civilization, and, the, terramare, culture, the, terramare, people, were, hunters, but, had, domesticated, animals, and, cultivated, crops, they, were, fairly, skilful, metallurgists, casting, bronze, in, moulds, in, the, late, bronze, age, from, the, late, 2nd, millennium, to, the, early, 1st, millennium, bc, a, fourth, wave, the, proto, villanovan, culture, brought, iron, working, to, the, italian, peninsula, proto, villanovan, culture, may, have, been, part, of, the, central, european, urnfield, culture, system, or, a, derivation, from, terramare, culture, various, authors, such, as, marija, gimbutas, associated, this, culture, with, the, spread, of, the, proto, italics, into, the, italian, peninsula, born, in, sardinia, and, southern, corsica, where, it, is, called, torrean, civilization, the, nuraghe, civilization, lasted, from, the, 18th, century, bc, to, the, 2nd, century, ad, they, take, their, name, from, the, characteristic, nuragic, towers, which, evolved, from, the, pre, existing, megalithic, culture, which, built, dolmens, and, menhirs, today, more, than, 7, 000, nuraghes, appear, in, sardinia, no, written, records, of, this, civilization, have, been, discovered, apart, from, a, few, possible, short, epigraphic, documents, the, only, written, information, comes, from, classical, literature, of, the, greeks, and, romans, and, may, be, considered, more, mythological, than, historical, the, language, or, languages, spoken, in, sardinia, during, the, bronze, age, is, are, unknown, since, there, are, no, written, records, from, the, period, although, research, suggests, that, around, the, 8th, century, bc, the, nuragic, populations, may, have, adopted, an, alphabet, similar, to, that, used, in, euboea, the, etruscan, civilization, flourished, in, central, italy, after, 800, bc, the, main, hypotheses, on, the, origins, of, the, etruscans, are, that, they, are, indigenous, probably, stemming, from, the, villanovan, culture, or, that, they, are, the, result, of, invasion, from, the, north, or, the, near, east, a, 2007, study, has, suggested, a, near, eastern, origin, the, researchers, conclude, that, their, data, taken, from, the, modern, tuscan, population, support, the, scenario, of, a, post, neolithic, genetic, input, from, the, near, east, to, the, present, day, population, of, tuscany, in, the, absence, of, any, dating, evidence, there, is, however, no, direct, link, between, this, genetic, input, and, the, etruscans, by, contrast, a, mitochondrial, dna, study, of, 2013, has, suggested, that, the, etruscans, were, probably, an, indigenous, population, among, ancient, populations, ancient, etruscans, are, found, to, be, closest, to, a, neolithic, population, from, central, europe, it, is, widely, accepted, that, etruscans, spoke, a, non, indo, european, language, some, inscriptions, in, a, similar, language, known, as, lemnian, have, been, found, on, the, aegean, island, of, lemnos, etruscans, were, a, monogamous, society, that, emphasized, pairing, the, historical, etruscans, had, achieved, a, form, of, state, with, remnants, of, chiefdom, and, tribal, forms, the, first, attestations, of, an, etruscan, religion, can, be, traced, to, the, villanovan, culture, etruscan, expansion, was, focused, across, the, apennines, the, political, structure, of, the, etruscan, culture, was, similar, albeit, more, aristocratic, to, magna, graecia, in, the, south, the, mining, and, commerce, of, metal, especially, copper, and, iron, led, to, an, enrichment, of, the, etruscans, and, to, the, expansion, of, their, influence, in, the, italian, peninsula, and, the, western, mediterranean, here, their, interests, collided, with, those, of, the, greeks, especially, in, the, 6th, century, bc, when, phoceans, of, italy, founded, colonies, along, the, coast, of, france, catalonia, and, corsica, this, led, the, etruscans, to, ally, themselves, with, the, carthaginians, around, 540, bc, the, battle, of, alalia, led, to, a, new, distribution, of, power, in, the, western, mediterranean, carthage, expanded, its, sphere, of, influence, at, the, expense, of, the, greeks, and, etruria, saw, itself, relegated, to, corsica, from, the, first, half, of, the, 5th, century, the, new, international, political, situation, meant, the, beginning, of, the, etruscan, decline, in, 480, bc, etruria, s, ally, carthage, was, defeated, by, a, coalition, of, magna, graecia, cities, led, by, syracuse, a, few, years, later, in, 474, bc, syracuse, s, tyrant, hiero, defeated, the, etruscans, at, the, battle, of, cumae, etruria, s, influence, over, the, cities, of, latium, and, campania, weakened, and, it, was, taken, over, by, romans, and, samnites, in, the, 4th, century, etruria, saw, a, gallic, invasion, end, its, influence, over, the, po, valley, and, the, adriatic, coast, meanwhile, rome, had, started, annexing, etruscan, cities, this, led, to, the, loss, of, their, north, provinces, etruscia, was, assimilated, by, rome, around, 500, bc, the, italic, peoples, were, an, ethnolinguistic, group, identified, by, use, of, italic, languages, among, the, italic, peoples, in, the, italian, peninsula, were, the, osci, the, veneti, the, samnites, the, latins, and, the, umbri, in, the, region, south, of, the, tiber, latium, vetus, the, latial, culture, of, the, latins, emerged, while, in, the, north, east, of, the, peninsula, the, este, culture, of, the, veneti, appeared, roughly, in, the, same, period, from, their, core, area, in, central, italy, modern, day, umbria, and, sabina, the, osco, umbrians, began, to, emigrate, in, various, waves, through, the, process, of, ver, sacrum, the, ritualized, extension, of, colonies, in, southern, latium, molise, and, the, whole, southern, half, of, the, peninsula, replacing, the, previous, tribes, such, as, the, opici, and, the, oenotrians, this, corresponds, with, the, emergence, of, the, terni, culture, which, had, strong, similarities, with, the, celtic, cultures, of, hallstatt, and, la, t, ne, before, and, during, the, period, of, the, arrival, of, the, greek, and, phoenician, immigrants, sicily, was, already, inhabited, by, native, italics, in, three, major, groups, the, elymians, in, the, west, the, sicani, in, the, centre, and, the, sicels, source, of, the, name, sicily, in, the, east, it, is, generally, believed, that, around, 2000, bc, the, ligures, occupied, a, large, area, of, the, peninsula, including, much, of, north, western, italy, and, all, of, northern, tuscany, since, many, scholars, consider, the, language, of, this, ancient, population, to, be, pre, indo, european, they, are, often, not, classified, as, italics, by, the, mid, first, millennium, bce, the, latins, of, rome, were, growing, in, power, and, influence, after, the, latins, had, liberated, themselves, from, etruscan, rule, they, acquired, a, dominant, position, among, the, italic, tribes, frequent, conflict, between, various, italic, tribes, followed, the, best, documented, are, the, samnite, wars, the, latins, eventually, succeeded, in, unifying, the, italic, elements, in, the, country, in, the, early, first, century, bce, several, italic, tribes, in, particular, the, marsi, and, the, samnites, rebelled, against, roman, rule, the, social, war, after, roman, victory, was, secured, all, peoples, in, italy, except, for, the, celts, of, the, po, valley, were, granted, roman, citizenship, in, the, subsequent, centuries, italic, tribes, adopted, latin, language, and, culture, in, a, process, known, as, romanization, in, the, eighth, and, seventh, centuries, bc, for, reasons, including, demographic, crisis, the, search, for, new, commercial, outlets, and, ports, and, expulsion, from, their, homeland, greeks, began, to, settle, along, the, coast, of, sicily, and, the, southern, part, of, the, italian, peninsula, which, became, known, as, magna, graecia, greek, culture, was, exported, to, italy, in, its, dialects, of, the, ancient, greek, language, its, religious, rites, and, its, traditions, of, the, independent, polis, an, original, hellenic, civilization, soon, developed, later, interacting, with, the, native, italic, and, latin, civilisations, the, most, important, cultural, transplant, was, the, chalcidean, cumaean, variety, of, the, greek, alphabet, which, was, adopted, by, the, etruscans, the, old, italic, alphabet, subsequently, evolved, into, the, latin, alphabet, many, of, the, new, hellenic, cities, became, very, rich, and, powerful, like, neapolis, naples, syracuse, acragas, and, sybaris, other, cities, in, magna, graecia, included, tarentum, epizephyrian, locri, rhegium, croton, thurii, elea, nola, ancona, syessa, bari, and, others, after, pyrrhus, of, epirus, failed, to, stop, the, spread, of, roman, hegemony, in, 282, bc, the, south, fell, under, roman, domination, it, was, held, by, the, byzantine, empire, after, the, fall, of, rome, in, the, west, and, even, the, lombards, failed, to, consolidate, it, though, the, centre, of, the, south, was, theirs, from, zotto, s, conquest, in, the, final, quarter, of, the, 6th, century, little, is, certain, about, the, history, of, the, roman, kingdom, as, nearly, no, written, records, from, that, time, survive, and, the, histories, written, during, the, republic, and, empire, are, largely, based, on, legends, according, to, the, founding, myth, of, rome, the, city, was, founded, on, 21, april, 753, bc, by, twin, brothers, romulus, and, remus, who, descended, from, the, trojan, prince, aeneas, and, who, were, grandsons, of, numitor, of, alba, longa, the, traditional, account, of, roman, history, which, has, come, down, through, livy, plutarch, dionysius, of, halicarnassus, and, others, is, that, in, rome, s, first, centuries, it, was, ruled, by, a, succession, of, seven, kings, the, gauls, destroyed, much, of, rome, s, historical, records, when, they, sacked, the, city, after, the, battle, of, the, allia, in, 390, or, 387, bc, with, no, contemporary, records, all, accounts, of, the, kings, must, be, carefully, evaluated, according, to, tradition, and, later, writers, such, as, livy, the, roman, republic, was, established, around, 509, bc, when, the, last, of, the, seven, kings, of, rome, tarquin, the, proud, was, deposed, by, lucius, junius, brutus, a, system, based, on, annually, elected, magistrates, and, various, representative, assemblies, was, established, a, constitution, set, a, series, of, checks, and, balances, and, a, separation, of, powers, the, most, important, magistrates, were, the, two, consuls, who, together, exercised, executive, authority, as, imperium, or, military, command, the, consuls, had, to, work, with, the, senate, which, was, initially, an, advisory, council, of, the, ranking, nobility, or, patricians, but, grew, in, size, and, power, in, the, 4th, century, bc, the, republic, came, under, attack, by, the, gauls, who, initially, prevailed, and, sacked, rome, the, romans, then, drove, the, gauls, back, led, by, camillus, the, romans, gradually, subdued, the, other, peoples, on, the, peninsula, the, last, threat, to, roman, hegemony, in, italy, came, when, tarentum, a, major, greek, colony, enlisted, the, aid, of, pyrrhus, of, epirus, in, 281, bc, but, this, effort, failed, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, rome, had, to, face, a, new, and, formidable, opponent, carthage, in, the, three, punic, wars, carthage, was, eventually, destroyed, and, rome, gained, control, over, hispania, sicily, and, north, africa, after, defeating, the, macedonian, and, seleucid, empires, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, the, romans, became, the, dominant, people, of, the, mediterranean, the, conquest, of, the, hellenistic, kingdoms, provoked, a, fusion, between, roman, and, greek, cultures, and, the, roman, elite, once, rural, became, a, luxurious, and, cosmopolitan, one, by, this, time, rome, was, a, consolidated, empire, in, the, military, view, and, had, no, major, enemies, roman, armies, occupied, spain, in, the, early, 2nd, century, bc, but, encountered, stiff, resistance, the, celtiberian, stronghold, of, numantia, became, the, centre, of, spanish, resistance, in, the, 140s, and, 130s, bc, numantia, fell, and, was, razed, to, the, ground, in, 133, bc, in, 105, bc, the, celtiberians, drove, the, cimbri, and, teutones, from, northern, spain, though, these, had, crushed, roman, arms, in, southern, gaul, inflicting, 80, 000, casualties, on, the, roman, army, the, conquest, of, hispania, was, completed, in, 19, bc, but, at, a, heavy, cost, towards, the, end, of, the, 2nd, century, bc, a, huge, migration, of, germanic, tribes, took, place, led, by, the, cimbri, and, the, teutones, these, tribes, overwhelmed, the, peoples, with, whom, they, came, into, contact, and, threatened, italy, at, the, battle, of, aquae, sextiae, and, the, battle, of, vercellae, the, germans, were, virtually, annihilated, in, these, two, battles, the, teutones, and, ambrones, are, said, to, have, lost, 290, 000, men, and, the, cimbri, 220, 000, in, the, mid, 1st, century, bc, the, republic, faced, a, period, of, political, crisis, and, social, unrest, julius, caesar, reconciled, the, two, more, powerful, men, in, rome, marcus, licinius, crassus, and, pompey, in, 53, bc, the, triumvirate, disintegrated, at, the, death, of, crassus, after, being, victorious, in, the, gallic, wars, caesar, crossed, the, rubicon, and, invaded, rome, in, 49, bc, rapidly, defeating, pompey, caesar, was, eventually, granted, a, dictatorship, for, perpetuity, but, was, murdered, in, 44, bc, caesar, s, assassination, caused, political, and, social, turmoil, without, the, dictator, s, leadership, rome, was, ruled, by, his, friend, and, colleague, mark, antony, octavian, caesar, s, adopted, son, along, with, antony, and, marcus, aemilius, lepidus, established, the, second, triumvirate, lepidus, was, forced, to, retire, in, 36, bc, after, betraying, octavian, in, sicily, antony, settled, in, egypt, with, his, lover, cleopatra, vii, which, was, seen, as, an, act, of, treason, following, antony, s, donations, of, alexandria, which, gave, cleopatra, the, title, of, queen, of, kings, and, to, their, children, the, regal, titles, to, the, newly, conquered, eastern, territories, war, between, octavian, and, mark, antony, broke, out, octavian, annihilated, egyptian, forces, in, the, battle, of, actium, in, 31, bc, mark, antony, and, cleopatra, committed, suicide, rome, thus, possessed, unchallenged, naval, supremacy, in, the, north, sea, atlantic, coasts, mediterranean, red, sea, and, the, black, sea, octavian, s, leadership, brought, the, zenith, of, the, roman, civilization, which, lasted, for, four, decades, his, adoption, of, the, name, augustus, in, 27, bc, is, usually, taken, by, historians, as, the, beginning, of, the, roman, empire, officially, the, government, was, republican, but, augustus, assumed, absolute, powers, the, senate, granted, octavian, a, unique, grade, of, proconsular, imperium, which, gave, him, authority, over, all, proconsuls, military, governors, the, unruly, imperial, provinces, at, the, borders, where, the, vast, majority, of, the, legions, were, stationed, were, under, the, control, of, augustus, the, peaceful, senatorial, provinces, were, under, the, control, of, the, senate, the, roman, legions, which, had, reached, an, unprecedented, number, around, 50, because, of, the, civil, wars, were, reduced, to, 28, as, provinces, were, being, established, throughout, the, mediterranean, roman, italy, maintained, a, special, status, which, made, it, domina, provinciarum, ruler, of, the, provinces, and, especially, in, relation, to, the, first, centuries, of, imperial, stability, rectrix, mundi, governor, of, the, world, and, omnium, terrarum, parens, parent, of, all, lands, such, a, status, meant, that, within, italy, in, times, of, peace, roman, magistrates, exercised, the, imperium, domi, police, power, as, an, alternative, to, the, imperium, militiae, military, power, italy, s, inhabitants, had, latin, rights, as, well, as, religious, and, financial, privileges, roman, literature, grew, steadily, in, the, golden, age, of, latin, literature, with, poets, like, vergil, horace, ovid, and, rufus, augustus, also, continued, the, shifts, on, the, calendar, promoted, by, caesar, and, the, month, of, august, is, named, after, him, augustus, enlightened, rule, resulted, in, 200, years, of, peace, for, the, empire, known, as, pax, romana, despite, its, military, strength, the, empire, made, few, efforts, to, expand, the, most, notable, being, the, conquest, of, britain, begun, by, emperor, claudius, 47, and, emperor, trajan, s, conquest, of, dacia, 101, 102, 105, 106, in, the, 1st, and, 2nd, centuries, roman, legions, were, also, employed, in, intermittent, warfare, with, the, germanic, tribes, to, the, north, and, the, parthian, empire, to, the, east, meanwhile, armed, insurrections, e, g, the, hebraic, insurrection, in, judea, 70, and, brief, civil,

jewish, revolt, 115, 117, led, to, the, death, of, more, than, 200, 000, jews, and, the, third, jewish, revolt, 132, 136, resulted, in, the, death, of, 580, 000, jewish, soldiers, after, the, 395, death, of, theodosius, i, the, empire, was, divided, into, an, eastern, and, a, western, roman, empire, the, western, part, faced, increasing, economic, and, political, crises, and, frequent, barbarian, invasions, so, the, capital, was, moved, from, mediolanum, to, ravenna, in, 476, the, last, western, emperor, romulus, augustulus, was, deposed, by, odoacer, odoacer, s, rule, ended, when, the, ostrogoths, under, the, leadership, of, theodoric, conquered, italy, decades, later, the, armies, of, eastern, emperor, justinian, entered, italy, with, the, goal, of, re, establishing, imperial, roman, rule, which, led, to, the, gothic, war, that, devastated, the, whole, country, with, famine, and, epidemics, this, ultimately, allowed, another, germanic, tribe, the, lombards, to, take, control, over, vast, regions, of, italy, in, 751, the, lombards, seized, ravenna, ending, byzantine, rule, in, northern, italy, facing, a, new, lombard, offensive, the, papacy, appealed, to, the, franks, for, aid, in, 756, frankish, forces, defeated, the, lombards, and, gave, the, papacy, legal, authority, over, much, of, central, italy, establishing, the, papal, states, in, 800, charlemagne, was, crowned, emperor, of, the, holy, roman, empire, after, the, death, of, charlemagne, 814, the, new, empire, disintegrated, under, his, weak, successors, resulting, in, a, power, vacuum, in, italy, and, coinciding, with, the, rise, of, islam, in, north, africa, and, the, middle, east, in, the, south, there, were, attacks, from, the, umayyad, caliphate, and, the, abbasid, caliphate, in, the, north, there, was, a, rising, power, of, communes, in, 852, the, saracens, took, bari, and, founded, an, emirate, there, islamic, rule, over, sicily, was, effective, from, 902, in, the, 11th, century, trade, slowly, recovered, as, the, cities, started, to, grow, again, and, the, papacy, regained, its, authority, the, investiture, controversy, over, whether, secular, authorities, had, any, legitimate, role, in, appointments, to, ecclesiastical, offices, was, resolved, by, the, concordat, of, worms, in, 1122, although, problems, continued, in, many, areas, of, europe, until, the, end, of, the, medieval, era, in, the, north, a, lombard, league, of, communes, launched, a, successful, effort, to, win, autonomy, from, the, holy, roman, empire, defeating, emperor, frederick, barbarossa,

of, government, keeping, direct, church, control, and, imperial, power, at, arm, s, length, the, many, independent, city, states, prospered, through, commerce, ultimately, creating, the, conditions, for, the, artistic, and, intellectual, changes, produced, by, the, renaissance, northern, cities, and, states, were, notable, for, their, merchant, republics, especially, the, republic, of, venice, compared, to, feudal, and, absolute, monarchies, the, merchant, republics, enjoyed, relative, political, freedom, during, this, period, many, italian, cities, developed, republican, forms, of, government, such, as, the, republics, of, florence, lucca, genoa, venice, and, siena, during, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, these, cities, became, major, financial, and, commercial, centres, milan,

and, economy, italy, was, the, main, centre, of, the, renaissance, whose, flourishing, of, the, arts, architecture, literature, science, historiography, and, political, theory, influenced, all, of,

long, conflict, the, genoese, succeeded, in, reducing, pisa, venice, proved, to, be, a, more, powerful, adversary, and, with, the, decline, of, genoese, power, during, the, 15th, century, venice, became, pre, eminent, on, the, seas, foreign, invasions, of, italy, the, italian, wars, began, with, the, 1494, invasion, by, france, that, wreaked, widespread, devastation, on, northern, italy, and, ended, the, independence, of, many, of, the, city, states, originally, arising, from, dynastic, disputes, over, the, duchy, of, milan, and, the, kingdom, of, naples, the, wars, rapidly, became, a,

history, marked, by, deep, political, and, social, changes, these, included, the, increase, of, papal, power, in, the, peninsula, and, the, influence, of, the, catholic, church, at, the, peak, of, the, counter, reformation, the, catholic, reaction, against, the, protestant, reformation, from, the, peace, of, cateau, cambr, sis, to, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, the, spanish, habsburgs, ruled, sicily, naples, and, milan, these, territories, passed, to, the, austrian, habsburgs, in, 1700, despite, important, artistic, and, scientific, achievements, such, as, the, discoveries, of, galileo, and, the, flourishing, of, baroque, style, after, 1600, italy, experienced, an, economic, catastrophe, in, 1600, northern, and, central, italy, comprised, one, of, the, most, advanced, industrial, areas, of, europe, with, an, exceptionally, high, standard, of, living, by, 1870, italy, was, an, economically, backward, and, depressed, area, its, industrial, structure, had, almost, collapsed, its, population, was, too, high, for, its, resources, its, economy, had, become, primarily, agricultural, wars, political, fractionalization, limited, fiscal, capacity, and, the, shift, of, world, trade, to, north, western, europe, and, the, americas, were, key, factors, the, growing, importance, of, the, atlantic, trade, undermined, the, importance, of, venice, as, a, commercial, hub, spain, s, involvement, in, the, thirty, years, war, 1618, 48, financed, in, part, by, taxes, on, its, italian, possessions, heavily, drained, the, commerce, and, agriculture, of, the, south, as, spain, declined, it, dragged, its, italian, domains, down, with, it, spreading, conflicts, and, revolts, such, as, the, neapolitan, 1647, tax, related, revolt, of, masaniello, the, plague, of, 1630, that, ravaged, northern, italy, notably, milan, and, venice, claimed, possibly, one, million, lives, or, about, 25, of, the, population, the, plague, of, 1656, killed, up, to, 43, of, the, population, of, the, kingdom, of, naples, historians, believe, the, dramatic, reduction, in, population, and, thus, in, economic, activity, contributed, to, italy, s, downfall, as, a, major, commercial, and, political, centre, by, one, estimate, while, in, 1500, the, gdp, of, italy, was, 106, of, the, french, gdp, by, 1700, it, was, only, 75, of, it, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, 1701, 1714, was, triggered, by, the, death, without, issue, of, the, last, habsburg, king, of, spain, charles, ii, who, fixed, the, spanish, inheritance, on, philip, duke, of, anjou, the, grandson, of, king, louis, xiv, of, france, in, face, of, the, threat, of, a, french, hegemony, over, much, of, europe, a, grand, alliance, between, austria, england, the, dutch, republic, and, other, minor, powers, including, the, duchy, of, savoy, was, signed, in, the, hague, the, alliance, successfully, fought, and, defeated, the, franco, spanish, party, of, the, two, crowns, and, the, subsequent, treaty, of, utrecht, and, rastatt, passed, control, of, much, of, italy, milan, naples, and, sardinia, from, spain, to, austria, while, sicily, was, ceded, to, the, duchy, of, savoy, spain, attempted, to, retake, territories, in, italy, and, to, claim, the, french, throne, in, the, war, of, the, quadruple, alliance, 1718, 1720, but, was, again, defeated, as, a, result, of, the, treaty, of, the, hague, spain, agreed, to, abandon, its, italian, claims, while, duke, victor, amadeus, ii, of, savoy, agreed, to, exchange, sicily, with, austria, for, the, island, of, sardinia, after, which, he, was, known, as, the, king, of, sardinia, the, spaniards, regained, naples, and, sicily, following, the, battle, of, bitonto, in, 1738, corsica, passed, from, the, republic, of, genoa, to, france, in, 1769, after, the, treaty, of, versailles, italian, was, the, official, language, of, corsica, until, 1859, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, italy, was, almost, in, the, same, political, conditions, as, in, the, 16th, century, the, main, differences, were, that, austria, had, replaced, spain, as, the, dominant, foreign, power, though, the, war, of, the, polish, succession, resulted, in, the, re, installment, of, the, spanish, in, the, south, as, the, house, of, bourbon, two, sicilies, and, that, the, dukes, of, savoy, had, become, kings, of, sardinia, in, 1796, the, french, army, of, italy, under, napoleon, invaded, italy, with, the, aims, of, forcing, the, first, coalition, to, abandon, sardinia, and, forcing, austria, to, withdraw, from, italy, within, only, two, weeks, victor, amadeus, iii, of, sardinia, was, forced, to, sign, an, armistice, napoleon, then, entered, milan, where, he, was, welcomed, as, a, liberator, subsequently, beating, off, austrian, counterattacks, and, continuing, to, advance, he, arrived, in, the, veneto, in, 1797, here, occurred, the, veronese, easters, an, act, of, rebellion, against, french, oppression, that, tied, down, napoleon, for, about, a, week, napoleon, conquered, most, of, italy, in, 1797, 99, he, set, up, a, series, of, new, republics, complete, with, new, codes, of, law, and, abolition, of, old,

coalition, recaptured, it, in, 1805, he, formed, the, kingdom, of, italy, with, himself, as, king, and, his, stepson, as, viceroy, all, these, new, countries, were, satellites, of, france, and, had, to, pay, large, subsidies, to, paris, as, well, as, provide, military, support, for, napoleon, s, wars, their, political, and, administrative, systems, were, modernized, the, metric, system,

monarchs, he, had, installed, tried, to, keep, their, thrones, by, feeding, nationalistic, sentiments, among, these, was, the, viceroy, of, italy, eug, ne, de, beauharnais, who, tried, to, get, austrian, approval, for, his, succession, to, the, kingdom, of, italy, and, joachim, murat, who, called, for, italian, patriots, help, for, the, unification, of, italy, under, his, rule, napoleon, was, defeated, on, 6, april, 1814, the, resulting, congress, of, vienna, 1814, restored, a, situation, close, to, that, of, 1795, dividing, italy, between, austria, in, the, north, east, and,

regained, murat, s, support, but, murat, proved, unable, to, convince, the, italians, to, fight, for, napoleon, with, his, proclamation, of, rimini, and, was, beaten, and, killed, the, italian, kingdoms, thus, fell, and, italy, s, restoration, period, began, with, many, pre, napoleonic, sovereigns, returned, to, their, thrones, piedmont, genoa, and, nice, came, to, be, united, as, did, sardinia, which, went, on, to, create, the, state, of, savoy, while, lombardy, veneto, istria, and, dalmatia, were, re, annexed, to, austria, the, dukedoms, of, parma, and, modena, re, formed, and, the, papal, states, and, the, kingdom, of, naples, returned, to, the, bourbons, the, political, and, social, events, in, the, restoration, period, of, italy, 1815, 1835, led, to, popular, uprisings, throughout, the, peninsula, and, greatly, shaped, what, would, become, the, italian, wars, of, independence, all, this, led, to, a, new, kingdom, of, italy, and, italian, unification, frederick, artz, emphasizes, the, benefits, the, italians, gained, french, historian, hippolyte, taine, stated, napoleon, far, more, italian, than, french, italian, by, race, by, instinct, imagination, and, souvenir, considers, in, his, plan, the, future, of, italy, and, on, casting, up, the, final, accounts, of, his, reign, we, find, that, the, net, loss, is, for, france, and, the, net, profit, is, for, italy, the, risorgimento, was, the, political, and, social, process, that, unified, different, states, of, the, italian, peninsula, it, is, difficult, to, pin, down, exact, dates, for, the, beginning, and, end, of, italian, reunification, but, most, scholars, agree, that, it, began, with, the, end, of, napoleonic, rule, and, the, congress, of, vienna, in, 1815, and, approximately, ended, with, the, franco, prussian, war, in, 1871, though, the, last, citt, irredente, did, not, join, until, the, italian, victory, in, world, war, i, in, 1820, spaniards, successfully, revolted, over, disputes, about, their, constitution, which, influenced, the, development, of, a, similar, movement, in, italy, a, regiment, in, the, army, of, the, kingdom, of, two, sicilies, commanded, by, guglielmo, pepe, a, carbonaro, member, of, the, secret, republican, organization, mutinied, conquering, the, peninsular, part, of, two, sicilies, the, king, ferdinand, i, agreed, to, enact, a, new, constitution, the, revolutionaries, though, failed, to, court, popular, support, and, fell, to, austrian, troops, of, the, holy, alliance, ferdinand, abolished, the, constitution, and, began, systematically, persecuting, revolutionaries, many, of, whom, were, forced, into, exile, the, leader, of, the, 1821, revolutionary, movement, in, piedmont, was, santorre, di, santarosa, who, wanted, to, remove, the, austrians, and, unify, italy, under, the, house, of, savoy, the, piedmont, revolt, started, in, alessandria, the, king, s, regent, prince, charles, albert, acting, while, the, king, charles, felix, was, away, approved, a, new, constitution, to, appease, the, revolutionaries, but, when, the, king, returned, he, disavowed, the, constitution, and, requested, assistance, from, the, holy, alliance, di, santarosa, s, troops, were, defeated, and, the, would, be, piedmontese, revolutionary, fled, to, paris, artistic, and, literary, sentiment, also, turned, towards, nationalism, perhaps, the, most, famous, of, proto, nationalist, works, was, alessandro, manzoni, s, i, promessi, sposi, the, betrothed, published, in, 1827, the, 1840, version, of, i, promessi, sposi, used, a, standardized, version, of, the, tuscan, dialect, a, conscious, effort, by, the, author, to, provide, a, language, and, force, people, to, learn, it, at, the, time, the, struggle, for, italian, unification, was, perceived, to, be, waged, primarily, against, the, austrian, empire, and, the, habsburgs, since, they, directly, controlled, the, predominantly, italian, speaking, northeastern, part, of, present, day, italy, and, were, the, single, most, powerful, force, against, unification, the, austrian, empire, vigorously, repressed, nationalist, sentiment, austrian, chancellor, franz, metternich, an, influential, diplomat, at, the, congress, of, vienna, stated, that, the, word, italy, was, nothing, more, than, a, geographic, expression, those, in, favour, of, unification, also, faced, opposition, from, the, holy, see, particularly, after, failed, attempts, to, broker, a, confederation, with, the, papal, states, which, would, have, left, the, papacy, with, some, measure, of, autonomy, over, the, region, pius, ix, feared, that, giving, up, power, in, the, region, could, mean, the, persecution, of, italian, catholics, even, among, those, who, wanted, to, see, the, peninsula, unified, different, groups, could, not, agree, on, what, form, a, unified, state, would, take, vincenzo, gioberti, suggested, a, confederation, of, italian, states, under, the, rulership, of, the, pope, his, book, of, the, moral, and, civil, primacy, of, the, italians, was, published, in, 1843, and, created, a, link, between, the, papacy, and, the, risorgimento, many, leading, revolutionaries, wanted, a, republic, but, eventually, it, was, a, king, and, his, chief, minister, who, had, the, power, to, unite, the, italian, states, as, a, monarchy, one, of, the, most, influential, revolutionary, groups, was, the, carbonari, charcoal, burners, a, secret, organization, formed, in, southern, italy, early, in, the, 19th, century, inspired, by, the, principles, of, the, french, revolution, its, members, were,

duchy, of, tuscany, the, duchy, of, modena, and, the, kingdom, of, lombardy, venetia, the, revolutionaries, were, so, feared, that, the, reigning, authorities, passed, an, ordinance, condemning, to, death, anyone, who, attended, a, carbonari, meeting, the, carbonari, condemned, napoleon, iii, to, death, for, failing, to, unite, italy, and, the, group, almost, succeeded, in, assassinating, him, in, 1858, many, leaders, of, the, unification, movement, were, at, one, time, members, of, this, organization, in, this, context, in, 1847, the, first, public, performance, of, the, song, il, canto, degli, italiani, the, italian, national, anthem, since, 1946, took, place, two, prominent, radical, figures, in, the, unification, movement, were, giuseppe, mazzini, and, giuseppe, garibaldi, the, more, conservative, constitutional, monarchic, figures, included, the, count, of, cavour, and, victor, emmanuel, ii, who, would, later, become, the, first, king, of, a, united, italy, mazzini, s, activity, in, revolutionary, movements, caused, him, to, be, imprisoned, soon, after, he, joined, while, in, prison, he, concluded, that, italy, could, and, therefore, should, be, unified, and, formulated, his, program, for, establishing, a, free, independent, and, republican, nation, with, rome, as, its, capital, after, mazzini, s, release, in, 1831, he, went, to, marseille, where, he, organized, a, new, political, society, called, la, giovine, italia, young, italy, seeking, the, unification, of, italy, garibaldi, participated, in, an, uprising, in, piedmont, in, 1834, was, sentenced, to, death, and, escaped, to, south, america, he, returned, to, italy, in, 1848, the, creation, of, the, kingdom, of, italy, was, the, result, of, concerted, efforts, by, italian, nationalists, and, monarchists, loyal, to, the, house, of, savoy, to, establish, a, united, kingdom, encompassing, the, entire, italian, peninsula, sardinia, industrialized, from, 1830, onward, a, constitution, the, statuto, albertino, was, enacted, in, the, year, of, revolutions, 1848, under, liberal, pressure, under, the, same, pressure, the, first, italian, war, of, independence, was, declared, on, austria, after, initial, success, the, war, took, a, turn, for, the, worse, and, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, lost, after, the, revolutions, of, 1848, the, apparent, leader, of, the, italian, unification, movement, was, garibaldi, popular, amongst, southern, italians, garibaldi, led, the, italian, republican, drive, for, unification, in, southern, italy, but, the, northern, italian, monarchy, of, the, house, of, savoy, in, the, kingdom, of, piedmont, sardinia, whose, government, was, led, by, camillo, benso, count, of, cavour, also, had, the, ambition, of, establishing, a, united, italian, state, although, the, kingdom, had, no, physical, connection, to, rome, deemed, the, natural, capital, of, italy, the, kingdom, had, successfully, challenged, austria, in, the, second, italian, war, of, independence, liberating, lombardy, venetia, from, austrian, rule, on, the, basis, of, the, plombi, res, agreement, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, ceded, savoy, and, nice, to, france, an, event, that, caused, the, ni, ard, exodus, that, was, the, emigration, of, a, quarter, of, the, ni, ard, italians, to, italy, the, kingdom, also, had, established, important, alliances, which, helped, it, improve, the, possibility, of, italian, unification, such, as, britain, and, france, in, the, crimean, war, garibaldi, was, elected, in, 1871, in, nice, at, the, national, assembly, where, he, tried, to, promote, the, annexation, of, his, hometown, to, the, italian, unitary, state, but, he, was, prevented, from, speaking, because, of, this, denial, between, 1871, and, 1872, there, were, riots, in, nice, promoted, by, the, garibaldini, and, called, ni, ard, vespers, which, demanded, the, annexation, of, the, city, and, its, area, to, italy, fifteen, nice, people, who, participated, in, the, rebellion, were, tried, and, sentenced, the, transition, was, not, smooth, for, the, south, the, mezzogiorno, the, path, to, unification, and, modernization, created, a, divide, between, northern, and, southern, italy, called, southern, question, the, entire, region, south, of, naples, was, afflicted, with, numerous, deep, economic, and, social, liabilities, however, many, of, the, south, s, political, problems, and, its, reputation, of, being, passive, or, lazy, politically, speaking, was, due, to, the, new, government, that, alienated, the, south, on, the, other, hand, transportation, was, difficult, soil, fertility, was, low, with, extensive, erosion, deforestation, was, severe, many, businesses, could, stay, open, only, because, of, high, protective, tariffs, large, estates, were, often, poorly, managed, most, peasants, had, only, very, small, plots, and, there, was, chronic, unemployment, and, high, crime, rates, cavour, decided, the, basic, problem, was, poor, government, and, believed, that, could, be, remedied, by, strict, application, of, the, piedmontese, legal, system, the, main, result, was, an, upsurge, in, brigandage, which, turned, into, a, bloody, civil, war, that, lasted, almost, ten, years, the, insurrection, reached, its, peak, mainly, in, basilicata, and, northern, apulia, headed, by, the, brigands, carmine, crocco, and, michele, caruso, with, the, end, of, the, southern, riots, there, was, an, outflow, of, millions, of, peasants, in, the, italian, diaspora, especially, to, the, united, states, and, south, america, others, relocated, to, the, northern, industrial, cities, such, as, genoa, milan, and, turin, and, sent, money, home, the, first, italian, diaspora, began, around, 1880, and, ended, in, the, 1920s, to, the, early, 1940s, with, the, rise, of, fascist, italy, poverty, was, the, main, reason, for, emigration, specifically, the, lack, of, land, as, mezzadria, sharecropping, flourished, in, italy, especially, in, the, south, and, property, became, subdivided, over, generations, especially, in, southern, italy, conditions, were, harsh, until, the, 1860s, to, 1950s, most, of, italy, was, a, rural, society, with, many, small, towns, and, cities, and, almost, no, modern, industry, in, which, land, management, practices, especially, in, the, south, and, the, northeast, did, not, easily, convince, farmers, to, stay, on, the, land, and, to, work, the, soil, another, factor, was, related, to, the, overpopulation, of, southern, italy, as, a, result, of, the, improvements, in, socioeconomic, conditions, after, unification, that, created, a, demographic, boom, and, forced, the, new, generations, to, emigrate, en, masse, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, the, early, 20th, century, mostly, to, the, americas, the, new, migration, of, capital, created, millions, of, unskilled, jobs, around, the, world, and, was, responsible, for, the, simultaneous, mass, migration, of, italians, searching, for, work, and, bread, italian, pane, e, lavoro, unification, broke, down, the, feudal, land, system, which, had, survived, in, the, south, since, the, middle, ages, especially, where, land, had, been, the, inalienable, property, of, aristocrats, religious, bodies, or, the, king, the, breakdown, of, feudalism, however, and, redistribution, of, land, did, not, necessarily, lead, to, small, farmers, in, the, south, winding, up, owning, arable, land, many, remained, landless, and, plots, grew, smaller, and, smaller, and, so, less, and, less, productive, as, land, was, subdivided, amongst, heirs, between, 1860, and, world, war, i, at, least, 9, million, italians, left, permanently, of, a, total, of, 16, million, who, emigrated, most, travelling, to, north, or, south, america, italy, became, a, nation, state, on, 17, march, 1861, when, most, of, the, states, of, the, peninsula, were, united, under, king, victor, emmanuel, ii, the, architects, of, italian, unification, were, camillo, benso, count, of, cavour, and, giuseppe, garibaldi, in, 1866, prussian, prime, minister, otto, von, bismarck, offered, victor, emmanuel, ii, an, alliance, with, the, kingdom, of, prussia, in, the, austro, prussian, war, in, exchange, prussia, would, allow, italy, to, annex, austrian, controlled, venice, king, emmanuel, agreed, to, the, alliance, and, the, third, italian, war, of, independence, began, the, victory, against, austria, allowed, italy, to, annex, venice, in, 1870, france, started, the, franco, prussian, war, and, brought, home, its, soldiers, in, rome, italy, marched, in, to, take, over, the, papal, state, italian, unification, was, completed, and, the, capital, was, moved, from, florence, to, rome, some, of, the, states, that, had, been, targeted, for, unification, terre, irredente, trentino, alto, adige, and, julian, march, did, not, join, the, kingdom, of, italy, until, 1918, after, italy, defeated, austria, hungary, in, the, first, world, war, for, this, reason, historians, sometimes, describe, the, unification, period, as, reaching, completion, only, with, the, armistice, of, villa, giusti, on, 4, november, 1918, parliamentary, democracy, developed, considerably, in, the, 19th, century, the, sardinian, statuto, albertino, of, 1848, extended, to, the, whole, kingdom, of, italy, in, 1861, provided, for, basic, freedoms, but, the, electoral, laws, excluded, the, non, propertied, and, uneducated, classes, from, voting, italy, s, political, arena, was, sharply, divided, between, broad, camps, of, left, and, right, which, created, frequent, deadlock, and, attempts, to, preserve, governments, marco, minghetti, lost, power, in, 1876, and, was, replaced, by, the, democrat, agostino, depretis, who, began, a, period, of, political, dominance, in, the, 1880s, but, continued, attempts, to, appease, the, opposition, to, hold, power, depretis, began, his, term, by, initiating, an, experimental, political, idea, called, trasformismo, transformism, the, theory, of, trasformismo, was, that, a, cabinet, should, select, a, variety, of, moderates, and, capable, politicians, from, a, non, partisan, perspective, in, practice, trasformismo, was, authoritarian, and, corrupt, depretis, pressured, districts, to, vote, for, his, candidates, if, they, wished, to, gain, favourable, concessions, from, depretis, when, in, power, resulting, in, only, four, representatives, from, the, right, being, elected, in, 1876, depretis, put, through, authoritarian, measures, such, as, banning, public, meetings, placing, dangerous, individuals, in, internal, exile, on, remote, penal, islands, and, adopting, militarist, policies, depretis, enacted, controversial, legislation, for, the, time, such, as, abolishing, arrest, for, debt, making, elementary, education, free, and, compulsory, while, ending, compulsory, religious, teaching, in, elementary, schools, the, first, government, of, depretis, collapsed, after, his, dismissal, of, his, interior, minister, and, ended, with, his, resignation, in, 1877, the, second, government, of, depretis, started, in, 1881, depretis, goals, included, widening, suffrage, in, 1882, and, increasing, the, tax, intake, from, italians, by, expanding, the, minimum, requirements, of, who, could, pay, taxes, and, the, creation, of, a, new, electoral, system, in, 1887, depretis, was, finally, pushed, out, of, office, after, years, of, political, decline, francesco, crispi, was, prime, minister, from, 1887, until, 1891, and, again, from, 1893, until, 1896, historian, r, j, b, bosworth, says, of, his, foreign, policy, that, crispi, pursued, policies, whose, openly, aggressive, character, would, not, be, equaled, until, the, days, of, the, fascist, regime, his, policies, were, ruinous, both, for, italy, s, trade, with, france, and, more, humiliatingly, for, colonial, ambitions, in, east, africa, crispi, s, major, concerns, during, 1887, 91, was, protecting, italy, from, austria, hungary, crispi, worked, to, build, italy, as, a, great, world, power, through, increased, military, expenditures, advocation, of, expansionism, and, trying, to, win, germany, s, favor, even, by, joining, the, triple, alliance, while, helping, italy, develop, strategically, he, continued, trasformismo, and, was, authoritarian, once, suggesting, the, use, of, martial, law, to, ban, opposition, parties, despite, being, authoritarian, crispi, put, through, liberal, policies, such, as, the, public, health, act, of, 1888, and, establishing, tribunals, for, redress, against, abuses, by, the, government, the, overwhelming, attention, paid, to, foreign, policy, alienated, the, agricultural, community, which, needed, help, both, radical, and, conservative, forces, in, the, italian, parliament, demanded, that, the, government, investigate, how, to, improve, agriculture, the, investigation, showed, that, agriculture, was, not, improving, that, landowners, were, swallowing, up, revenue, from, their, lands, and, contributing, almost, nothing, to, development, of, the, land, there, was, aggravation, by, lower, class, italians, to, the, break, up, of, communal, lands, which, benefited, only, landlords, most, of, the, workers, on, the, agricultural, lands, were, not, peasants, but, short, term, labourers, who, at, best, were, employed, for, one, year, peasants, without, stable, income, were, forced, to, live, off, meager, food, supplies, disease, was, spreading, rapidly, plagues, were, reported, including, a, major, cholera, epidemic, which, killed, at, least, 55, 000, people, the, italian, government, could, not, deal, with, the, situation, effectively, due, to, the, mass, overspending, that, left, italy, in, huge, debt, italy, also, suffered, economically, because, of, overproduction, of, grapes, in, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, when, france, s, vineyard, industry, was, suffering, from, vine, disease, italy, during, that, time, prospered, as, the, largest, exporter, of, wine, in, europe, but, following, the, recovery, of, france, in, 1888, southern, italy, was, overproducing, and, had, to, split, in, two, which, caused, greater, unemployment, and, bankruptcies, from, 1901, to, 1914, italian, history, and, politics, was, dominated, by, giovanni, giolitti, he, first, confronted, the, wave, of, widespread, discontent, that, crispi, s, policy, had, provoked, no, more, authoritarian, repression, but, acceptance, of, protests, and, therefore, of, strikes, as, long, as, they, are, neither, violent, nor, political, with, the, successful, aim, of, bringing, the, socialists, in, the, political, life, of, the, country, giolitti, s, most, important, interventions, were, social, and, labor, legislation, universal, male, suffrage, the, nationalization, of, the, railways, and, insurance, companies, the, reduction, of, state, debt, and, the, development, of, infrastructure, and, industry, in, foreign, policy, there, was, a, movement, away, from, germany, and, austria, hungary, and, toward, the, triple, entente, of, france, britain, and, russia, starting, from, the, late, 19th, century, italy, developed, its, own, colonial, empire, it, took, control, of, somalia, its, attempt, to, occupy, ethiopia, failed, in, the, first, italo, ethiopian, war, of, 1895, 1896, in, 1911, giolitti, s, government, sent, forces, to, occupy, libya, and, declared, war, on, the, ottoman, empire, italy, soon, annexed, libya, then, divided, in, tripolitania, and, cyrenaica, and, the, dodecanese, islands, after, the, italo, turkish, war, nationalists, advocated, italy, s, domination, of, the, mediterranean, sea, by, occupying, greece, as, well, as, the, adriatic, coastal, region, of, dalmatia, but, no, attempts, were, made, in, june, 1914, the, left, became, repulsed, by, the, government, after, the, killing, of, three, anti, militarist, demonstrators, the, italian, socialist, party, declared, a, general, strike, in, italy, the, protests, that, ensued, became, known, as, red, week, as, leftists, rioted, and, various, acts, of, civil, disobedience, occurred, such, as, seizing, railway, stations, cutting, telephone, wires, and, burning, tax, registers, italy, entered, into, the, first, world, war, in, 1915, with, the, aim, of, completing, national, unity, for, this, reason, it, is, also, considered, the, fourth, italian, war, of, independence, in, a, historiographical, perspective, that, identifies, in, the, latter, the, conclusion, of, the, unification, of, italy, the, war, forced, the, decision, whether, to, honor, the, alliance, with, germany, and, austria, for, six, months, italy, remained, neutral, as, the, triple, alliance, was, only, for, defensive, purposes, italy, took, the, initiative, in, entering, the, war, in, spring, 1915, despite, strong, popular, and, elite, sentiment, in, favor, of, neutrality, italy, was, a, large, poor, country, whose, political, system, was, chaotic, its, finances, were, heavily, strained, and, its, army, was, very, poorly, prepared, the, triple, alliance, meant, little, either, to, italians, or, austrians, prime, minister, antonio, salandra, and, foreign, minister, sidney, sonnino, negotiated, with, both, sides, in, secret, for, the, best, deal, and, got, one, from, the, entente, which, was, quite, willing, to, promise, large, slices, of, the, austro, hungarian, empire, including, the, tyrol, and, trieste, as, well, as, making, albania, a, protectorate, russia, vetoed, giving, italy, dalmatia, britain, was, willing, to, pay, subsidies, and, loans, to, get, 36, million, italians, as, new, allies, who, threatened, the, southern, flank, of, austria, when, the, treaty, of, london, was, announced, in, may, 1915, there, was, an, uproar, from, antiwar, elements, reports, from, around, italy, showed, the, people, feared, war, and, cared, little, about, territorial, gains, pro, war, supporters, mobbed, the, streets, the, fervor, for, war, represented, a, bitterly, hostile, reaction, against, politics, as, usual, and, the, failures, frustrations, and, stupidities, of, the, ruling, class, benito, mussolini, created, the, newspaper, il, popolo, d, italia, which, at, first, attempted, to, convince, socialists, and, revolutionaries, to, support, the, war, the, allied, powers, eager, to, draw, italy, to, the, war, helped, finance, the, newspaper, later, after, the, war, this, publication, would, become, the, official, newspaper, of, the, fascist, movement, italy, entered, the, war, with, an, army, of, 875, 000, men, but, the, army, was, poorly, led, and, lacked, heavy, artillery, and, machine, guns, their, war, supplies, having, been, largely, depleted, in, the, war, of, 1911, 12, against, turkey, italy, proved, unable, to, prosecute, the, war, effectively, as, fighting, raged, for, three, years, on, a, very, narrow, front, along, the, isonzo, river, where, the, austrians, held, the, high, ground, in, 1916, italy, declared, war, on, germany, some, 650, 000, italian, soldiers, died, and, 950, 000, were, wounded, while, the, economy, required, large, scale, allied, funding, to, survive, before, the, war, the, government, had, ignored, labor, issues, but, now, it, had, to, intervene, to, mobilize, war, production, with, the, main, working, class, socialist, party, reluctant, to, support, the, war, effort, strikes, were, frequent, and, cooperation, was, minimal, especially, in, the, socialist, strongholds, of, piedmont, and, lombardy, the, government, imposed, high, wage, scales, as, well, as, collective, bargaining, and, insurance, schemes, many, large, firms, expanded, dramatically, inflation, doubled, the, cost, of, living, industrial, wages, kept, pace, but, not, wages, for, farm, workers, discontent, was, high, in, rural, areas, since, so, many, men, were, taken, for, service, industrial, jobs, were, unavailable, wages, grew, slowly, and, inflation, was, just, as, bad, the, italian, victory, which, was, announced, by, the, bollettino, della, vittoria, and, the, bollettino, della, vittoria, navale, marked, the, end, of, the, war, on, the, italian, front, secured, the, dissolution, of, the, austro, hungarian, empire, and, was, chiefly, instrumental, in, ending, the, first, world, war, less, than, two, weeks, later, more, than, 651, 000, italian, soldiers, died, on, the, battlefields, the, italian, civilian, deaths, were, estimated, at, 589, 000, due, to, malnutrition, and, food, shortages, in, november, 1918, after, the, surrender, of, austria, hungary, italy,

governorate, of, dalmatia, which, had, the, provisional, aim, of, ferrying, the, territory, towards, full, integration, into, the, kingdom, of, italy, progressively, importing, national, legislation, in, place, of, the, previous, one, the, administrative, capital, was, zara, the, governorate, of, dalmatia, was, evacuated, following, the, italo, yugoslav, agreements, which, resulted, in, the, treaty, of, rapallo, 1920, as, the, war, came, to, an, end, italian, prime, minister, vittorio, emanuele, orlando, met, with, british, prime, minister, david, lloyd, george, prime, minister, of, france, georges, clemenceau, and, united, states, president, woodrow, wilson, in, versailles, to, discuss, how, the, borders, of, europe, should, be, redefined, to, help, avoid, a, future, european, war, the, talks, provided, little, territorial, gain, to, italy, as, wilson, promised, freedom, to, all, european, nationalities, to, form, their, nation, states, as, a, result, the, treaty, of, versailles, did, not, assign, dalmatia, and, albania, to, italy, as, had, been, promised, furthermore, the, british, and, french, decided, to, divide, the, german, overseas, colonies, into, their, mandates, with, italy, receiving, none, italy, also, gained, no, territory, from, the, breakup, of, the, ottoman, empire, despite, this, orlando, agreed, to, sign, the, treaty, of, versailles, which, caused, uproar, against, his, government, the, treaty, of, saint, germain, en, laye, 1919, and, the, treaty, of, rapallo, 1920, allowed, the, annexation, of, trentino, alto, adige, julian, march,

nationalists, to, form, the, free, state, of, fiume, in, september, 1919, his, popularity, among, nationalists, led, him, to, be, called, il, duce, the, leader, and, he, used, black, shirted, paramilitary, in, his, assault, on, fiume, the, leadership, title, of, duce, and, the, blackshirt, paramilitary, uniform, would, later, be, adopted, by, the, fascist, movement, of, benito, mussolini, the, demand, for, the, italian, annexation, of, fiume, spread, to, all, sides, of, the, political, spectrum, the, subsequent, treaty, of, rome, 1924, led, to, the, annexation, of, the, city, of, fiume, to, italy, italy, s, lack, of, territorial, gain, led, to, the, outcome, being, denounced, as, a, mutilated, victory, the, rhetoric, of, mutilated, victory, was, adopted, by, mussolini, and, led, to, the, rise, of, italian, fascism, becoming, a, key, point, in, the, propaganda, of, fascist, italy, historians, regard, mutilated, victory, as, a, political, myth, used, by, fascists, to, fuel, italian, imperialism, and, obscure, the, successes, of, liberal, italy, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, i, italy, also, gained, a, permanent, seat, in, the, league, of, nations, s, executive, council, benito, mussolini, created, the, fasci, di, combattimento, or, combat, league, in, 1919, it, was, originally, dominated, by, patriotic, socialist, and, syndicalist, veterans, who, opposed, the, pacifist, policies, of, the, italian, socialist, party, this, early, fascist, movement, had, a, platform, more, inclined, to, the, left, promising, social, revolution, proportional, representation, in, elections, women, s, suffrage, partly, realized, in, 1925, and, dividing, rural, private, property, held, by, estates, they, also, differed, from, later, fascism, by, opposing, censorship, militarism, and, dictatorship, at, the, same, time, the, so, called, biennio, rosso, red, biennium, took, place, in, the, two, years, following, the, war, in, a, context, of, economic, crisis, high, unemployment, and, political, instability, the, 1919, 20, period, was, characterized, by, mass, strikes, worker, manifestations, as, well, as, self, management, experiments, through, land, and, factory, occupations, in, turin, and, milan, workers, councils, were, formed, and, many, factory, occupations, took, place, under, the, leadership, of, anarcho, syndicalists, the, agitations, also, extended, to, the, agricultural, areas, of, the, padan, plain, and, were, accompanied, by, peasant, strikes, rural, unrests, and, guerilla, conflicts, between, left, wing, and, right, wing, militias, thenceforth, the, fasci, di, combattimento, forerunner, of, the, national, fascist, party, 1921, successfully, exploited, the, claims, of, italian, nationalists, and, the, quest, for, order, and, normalization, of, the, middle, class, in, october, 1922, mussolini, took, advantage, of, a, general, strike, to, announce, his, demands, to, the, italian, government, to, give, the, fascist, party, political, power, or, face, a, coup, with, no, immediate, response, a, group, of, 30, 000, fascists, began, a, long, trek, across, italy, to, rome, the, march, on, rome, claiming, that, fascists, were, intending, to, restore, law, and, order, the, fascists, demanded, prime, minister, luigi, facta, s, resignation, and, that, mussolini, be, named, to, the, post, although, the, italian, army, was, far, better, armed, than, the, fascist, militias, the, liberal, system, and, king, victor, emmanuel, iii, were, facing, a, deeper, political, crisis, the, king, was, forced, to, choose, which, of, the, two, rival, movements, in, italy, would, form, the, government, mussolini, s, fascists, or, the, marxist, italian, socialist, party, he, selected, the, fascists, mussolini, formed, a, coalition, with, nationalists, and, liberals, and, in, 1923, passed, the, electoral, acerbo, law, which, assigned, two, thirds, of, the, seats, to, the, party, that, achieved, at, least, 25, of, the, vote, the, fascist, party, used, violence, and, intimidation, to, achieve, the, threshold, in, the, 1924, election, thus, obtaining, control, of, parliament, socialist, deputy, giacomo, matteotti, was, assassinated, after, calling, for, a, nullification, of, the, vote, the, parliament, opposition, responded, to, matteotti, s, assassination, with, the, aventine, secession, over, the, next, four, years, mussolini, eliminated, nearly, all, checks, and, balances, on, his, power, on, 24, december, 1925, he, passed, a, law, that, declared, he, was, responsible, to, the, king, alone, making, him, the, sole, person, able, to, determine, parliament, s, agenda, local, governments, were, dissolved, and, appointed, officials, called, podest, replaced, elected, mayors, and, councils, in, 1928, all, political, parties, were, banned, and, parliamentary, elections, were, replaced, by, plebiscites, in, which, the, grand, council, of, fascism, nominated, a, single, list, of, 400, candidates, christopher, duggan, argues, that, his, regime, exploited, mussolini, s, popular, appeal, and, forged, a, cult, of, personality, that, served, as, the, model, that, was, emulated, by, dictators, of, other, fascist, regimes, of, the, 1930s, in, summary, historian, stanley, g, payne, says, that, fascism, in, italy, was, during, the, unification, of, italy, in, the, mid, 19th, century, the, papal, states, resisted, incorporation, into, the, new, nation, the, nascent, kingdom, of, italy, invaded, and, occupied, romagna, the, eastern, portion, of, the, papal, states, in, 1860, leaving, only, latium, in, the, pope, s, domains, latium, including, rome, itself, was, occupied, and, annexed, in, 1870, for, the, following, sixty, years, relations, between, the, papacy, and, the, italian, government, were, hostile, and, the, status, of, the, pope, became, known, as, the, roman, question, the, lateran, treaty, was, one, component, of, the, lateran, pacts, of, 1929, agreements, between, the, kingdom, of, italy, under, king, victor, emmanuel, iii, of, italy, and, the, holy, see, under, pope, pius, xi, to, settle, the, question, the, treaty, and, associated, pacts, were, signed, on, 11, february, 1929, the, treaty, recognized, vatican, city, as, an, independent, state, under, the, sovereignty, of, the, holy, see, the, italian, government, also, agreed, to, give, the, roman, catholic, church, financial, compensation, for, the, loss, of, the, papal, states, in, 1948, the, lateran, treaty, was, recognized, in, the, constitution, of, italy, as, regulating, the, relations, between, the, state, and, the, catholic, church, the, treaty, was, significantly, revised, in, 1984, ending, the, status, of, catholicism, as, the, sole, state, religion, lee, identifies, three, major, themes, in, mussolini, s, foreign, policy, the, first, was, a, continuation, of, the, foreign, policy, objectives, of, the, preceding, liberal, regime, liberal, italy, had, allied, itself, with, germany, and, austria, and, had, great, ambitions, in, the, balkans, and, north, africa, ever, since, it, had, been, badly, defeated, in, ethiopia, in, 1896, there, was, a, strong, demand, for, seizing, that, country, second, was, a, profound, disillusionment, after, the, heavy, losses, of, the, first, world, war, the, small, territorial, gains, from, austria, were, not, enough, to, compensate, third, was, mussolini, s, promise, to, restore, the, pride, and, glory, of, the, roman, empire, italian, fascism, is, based, upon, italian, nationalism, and, in, particular, seeks, to, complete, what, it, considers, as, the, incomplete, project, of, risorgimento, by, incorporating, italia, irredenta, unredeemed, italy, into, the, state, of, italy, to, the, east, of, italy, the, fascists, claimed, that, dalmatia, was, a, land, of, italian, culture, to, the, south, the, fascists, claimed, malta, which, belonged, to, the, united, kingdom, and, corfu, which, belonged, to, greece, to, the, north, claimed, italian, switzerland, while, to, the, west, claimed, corsica, nice, and, savoy, which, belonged, to, france, mussolini, promised, to, bring, italy, back, as, a, great, power, in, europe, building, a, new, roman, empire, and, holding, power, over, the, mediterranean, sea, in, propaganda, fascists, used, the, ancient, roman, motto, mare, nostrum, latin, for, our, sea, to, describe, the, mediterranean, for, this, reason, the, fascist, regime, engaged, in, interventionist, foreign, policy, in, europe, in, 1923, the, greek, island, of, corfu, was, briefly, occupied, by, italy, after, the, assassination, of, general, tellini, in, greek, territory, in, 1925, albania, came, under, heavy, italian, influence, as, a, result, of, the, tirana, treaties, which, also, gave, italy, a, stronger, position, in, the, balkans, relations, with, france, were, mixed, the, fascist, regime, planned, to, regain, italian, populated, areas, of, france, with, the, rise, of, nazism, it, became, more, concerned, about, the, potential, threat, of, germany, to, italy, due, to, concerns, about, german, expansionism, italy, joined, the, stresa, front, with, france, and, the, united, kingdom, which, existed, from, 1935, to, 1936, the, fascist, regime, held, negative, relations, with, yugoslavia, as, it, continued, to, claim, dalmatia, during, the, spanish, civil, war, between, the, socialist, republicans, and, nationalists, led, by, francisco, franco, italy, sent, arms, and, over, 60, 000, troops, to, aid, the, nationalist, faction, this, secured, italy, s, naval, access, to, spanish, ports, and, increased, italian, influence, in, the, mediterranean, during, the, 1930s, italy, strongly, pursued, a, policy, of, naval, rearmament, by, 1940, the, regia, marina, was, the, fourth, largest, navy, in, the, world, mussolini, and, adolf, hitler, first, met, in, june, 1934, when, mussolini, opposed, german, plans, to, annex, austria, to, ensure, that, nazi, germany, would, not, become, hegemonic, in, europe, public, appearances, and, propaganda, constantly, portrayed, the, closeness, of, mussolini, and, hitler, and, the, similarities, between, italian, fascism, and, german, national, socialism, while, both, ideologies, had, significant, similarities, the, two, factions, were, suspicious, of, each, other, and, both, leaders, were, in, competition, for, world, influence, in, 1935, mussolini, decided, to, invade, ethiopia, 2, 313, italians, and, 275, 000, ethiopians, died, the, second, italo, ethiopian, war, resulted, in, the, international, isolation, of, italy, the, only, nation, to, back, italy, s, aggression, was, germany, after, being, condemned, by, the, league, of, nations, italy, decided, to, leave, the, league, on, 11, december, 1937, mussolini, had, little, choice, but, to, join, hitler, in, international, politics, thus, he, reluctantly, abandoned, support, of, austrian, independence, mussolini, later, supported, german, claims, on, sudetenland, at, the, munich, conference, in, 1938, under, the, influence, of, hitler, mussolini, supported, the, adoption, of, anti, semitic, racial, laws, in, italy, after, germany, annexed, czechoslovakia, in, march, 1939, italy, invaded, albania, and, made, it, an, italian, protectorate, as, war, approached, in, 1939, the, fascist, regime, stepped, up, an, aggressive, press, campaign, against, france, claiming, that, its, italian, residents, were, suffering, this, was, important, to, the, alliance, as, both, regimes, mutually, had, claims, on, france, germany, on, german, populated, alsace, lorraine, and, italy, on, the, mixed, italian, and, french, populated, nice, and, corsica, in, may, 1939, a, formal, alliance, with, germany, was, signed, known, as, the, pact, of, steel, mussolini, felt, obliged, to, sign, the, pact, in, spite, of, his, own, concerns, that, italy, could, not, fight, a, war, in, the, near, future, this, obligation, grew, from, his, promises, to, italians, that, he, would, build, an, empire, for, them, and, from, his, personal, desire, to, not, allow, hitler, to, become, the, dominant, leader, in, europe, mussolini, was, repulsed, by, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, agreement, where, germany, and, the, soviet, union, agreed, to, partition, the, second, polish, republic, into, german, and, soviet, zones, for, an, impending, invasion, the, fascist, government, saw, this, as, a, betrayal, of, the, anti, comintern, pact, but, decided, to, remain, officially, silent, when, germany, invaded, poland, on, 1, september, 1939, beginning, world, war, ii, mussolini, chose, to, stay, non, belligerent, although, he, declared, his, support, for, hitler, in, drawing, out, war, plans, mussolini, and, the, fascist, regime, decided, that, italy, would, aim, to, annex, large, portions, of, africa, and, the, middle, east, hesitance, remained, from, the, king, and, military, commander, pietro, badoglio, who, warned, mussolini, that, italy, had, too, few, tanks, armoured, vehicles, and, aircraft, available, to, be, able, to, carry, out, a, long, term, war, mussolini, and, the, fascist, regime, thus, waited, as, france, was, invaded, by, germany, in, june, 1940, battle, of, france, before, deciding, to, get, involved, italy, entered, the, war, on, 10, june, 1940, fulfilling, its, obligations, towards, the, pact, of, steel, mussolini, hoped, to, quickly, capture, savoy, nice, corsica, and, the, african, colonies, of, tunisia, and, algeria, from, the, french, but, germany, signed, an, armistice, 22, june, second, armistice, at, compi, gne, with, marshal, philippe, p, tain, establishing, vichy, france, that, retained, control, over, southern, france, and, colonies, this, decision, angered, the, fascist, regime, in, summer, 1940, mussolini, ordered, the, bombing, of, mandatory, palestine, and, the, conquest, of, british, somaliland, in, september, he, ordered, the, invasion, of, egypt, despite, initial, success, italian, forces, were, soon, driven, back, by, the, british, see, operation, compass, hitler, had, to, intervene, with, the, sending, of, the, afrika, korps, that, was, the, mainstay, in, the, north, african, campaign, on, 28, october, mussolini, launched, an, attack, on, greece, the, royal, air, force, prevented, the, italian, invasion, and, allowed, the, greeks, to, push, the, italians, back, to, albania, hitler, came, to, mussolini, s, aid, by, attacking, the, greeks, through, the, balkans, the, balkans, campaign, had, as, a, result, the, dissolution, of, yugoslavia, and, greece, s, defeat, italy, gained, southern, slovenia, dalmatia, montenegro, and, established, the, puppet, states, of, croatia, and, hellenic, state, by, 1942, it, was, faltering, as, its, economy, failed, to, adapt, to, the, conditions, of, war, and, italian, cities, were, being, heavily, bombed, by, the, allies, also, despite, rommel, s, advances, the, campaign, in, north, africa, began, to, fail, in, late, 1942, the, complete, collapse, came, after, the, decisive, defeat, at, el, alamein, by, 1943, italy, was, losing, on, every, front, half, of, the, italian, forces, fighting, in, the,

in, an, effort, to, knock, italy, out, of, the, war, and, establish, a, foothold, in, europe, on, 25, july, mussolini, was, ousted, by, the, great, council, of, fascism, and, arrested, by, order, of, king, victor, emmanuel, iii, who, appointed, general, pietro, badoglio, as, new, prime, minister, badoglio, stripped, away, the, final, elements, of, fascist, rule, by, banning, the, national, fascist, party, then, signed, an, armistice, with, the, allied, armed, forces, donald, detwiler, notes, that, italy, s, entrance, into, the, war, showed, very, early, that, her, military, strength, was, only, a, hollow, shell, historians, have, long, debated, why, italy, s, military, and, its, fascist, regime, were, so, remarkably, ineffective, at, war, which, was, central, to, their, identity, macgregor, knox, says, the, explanation, was, first, and, foremost, a, failure, of, italy, s, military, culture, and, military, institutions, norman, polmar, and, thomas, b, allen, argue, that, the, regia, aeronautica, failed, to, perform, effectively, in, modern, conflict, james, sadkovich, gives, the, most, charitable, interpretation, of, italian, failures, blaming, inferior, equipment, overextension, and, inter, service, rivalries, its, forces, had, more, than, their, share, of, handicaps, soon, after, being, ousted, mussolini, was, rescued, by, a, german, commando, in, operation,
