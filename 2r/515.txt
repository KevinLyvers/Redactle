following, an, attempted, coup, and, the, failure, of, the, siege, of, beijing, the, taiping, rebels, were, defeated, by, decentralised, provincial, armies, such, as, the, xiang, army, organised, and,

religious, unrest, within, the, country, exacerbating, ethnic, disputes, and, accelerating, the, rise, of, provincial, power, historians, debate, whether, these, developments, played, a, role, in, the, start, of, the, warlord, era, the, loss, of, central, control, after, the, establishment, of, republic, of, china, in, 1912, the, terms, which, writers, use, for, the, conflict, and, its, participants, often, represent, their, different, opinions, during, the, 19th, century, the, qing, did, not, describe, the, conflict, as, either, a, civil, war, or, a, movement, because, doing, so, would, have, lent, credibility, to, the, taiping, instead, they, referred, to, the, tumultuous, civil, war, as, a, period, of, chaos, lu, n, rebellion, n, or, military, ascendancy, b, ngx, ng, they, often, referred, to, it, as, the, hong, yang, rebellion, h, ngy, ng, zh, lu, n, referring, to, the, two, most, prominent, leaders, it, was, also, dismissively, referred, to, as, the, red, sheep, rebellion, h, ngy, ng, zh, lu, n, because, the, two, names, sound, similar, in, chinese, in, modern, china, the, war, is, often, referred, to, as, the, taiping, heavenly, kingdom, movement, due, to, the, fact, that, the, taiping, espoused, a, doctrine, which, was, both, nationalist, and, communist, and, the, taiping, represented, a, popular, ideology, which, was, based, on, either, han, nationalism, or, protocommunist, values, the, scholar, jian, youwen, is, among, those, who, refer, to, the, rebellion, as, the, taiping, revolutionary, movement, on, the, grounds, that, it, worked, towards, a, complete, change, in, the, political, and, social, system, rather, than, working, towards, the, replacement, of, one, dynasty, with, another, many, western, historians, refer, to, the, conflict, in, general, as, the, taiping, rebellion, recently, however, scholars, such, as, tobie, meyer, fong, and, stephen, platt, have, argued, that, the, term, taiping, rebellion, is, biased, because, it, insinuates, that, the, qing, government, was, a, legitimate, government, which, was, fighting, against, the, illegitimate, taiping, rebels, instead, they, argue, that, the, conflict, should, be, called, a, civil, war, other, historians, such, as, j, rgen, osterhammel, term, the, conflict, taiping, revolution, because, of, the, rebels, radical, transformational, objectives, and, the, social, revolution, that, they, initiated, little, is, known, about, how, the, taiping, referred, to, the, war, but, the, taiping, often, referred, to, the, qing, in, general, and, the, manchus, in, particular, as, some, variant, of, demons, or, monsters, y, o, representing, hong, s, proclamation, that, they, were, fighting, a, holy, war, to, rid, the, world, of, demons, and, establish,

and, informed, hong, that, his, given, name, violated, taboos, and, had, to, be, changed, suggesting, hong, xiuquan, the, moniker, ultimately, adopted, by, hong, in, later, embellishments, hong, would, declare, that, he, also, saw, confucius, being, punished, by, his, celestial, father, for, leading, the, people, astray, in, 1843, hong, failed, the, imperial, examinations, for, the, fourth, and, final, time, it, was, only, then, prompted, by, a, visit, by, his, cousin, that, hong, took, time, to, carefully, examine, christian, pamphlets, he, had, received, from, a, protestant, christian,

coalescence, of, local, brawls, and, riots, triggered, by, trivial, causes, among, these, causes, were, false, rumors, that, the, hui, muslims, were, aiding, the, taiping, rebels, the, hui, ma, xiaoshi, claimed, that, the, shaanxi, muslim, rebellion, was, connected, to, the, taiping, jonathan, spence, claims, that, a, key, reason, for, the, taiping, s, defeat, was, its, inability, to, coordinate, its, rebellion, with, other, rebellions, the, rebels, announced, social, reforms, including, strict, separation, of, the, sexes, abolition, of, foot, binding, land, socialisation, and, suppression, of, private, trade, they, also, outlawed, the, importation, of, opium, into, all, taiping, territories, in, regard, to, religion, the, kingdom, replaced, confucianism, buddhism, and, chinese, folk, religion, with, the, taiping, christianity, god, worshipping, which, held, that, hong, xiuquan, was, the, younger, brother, of, jesus, and, the, second, son, of, shangdi, buddhist, libraries, were, burned, because, hong, saw, confucianism, was, a, shadow, of, its, noble, origin, being, now, a, tool, of, the, qing, to, tyrannize, han, people, libraries, of, the, confucian, monasteries, were, destroyed, in, the, yangtze, delta, almost, entirely, and, the, temples, were, often, defaced, or, turned, into, temples, of, his, new, religion, or, hospitals, and, libraries, traditionalist, works, like, those, of, confucius, were, burned, and, their, sellers, executed, the, taiping, were, especially, opposed, to, idolatry, destroying, idols, wherever, found, with, great, prejudice, though, the, destruction, of, idols, was, initially, welcomed, by, foreign, missionaries, missionaries, eventually, came, to, fear, the, zealotry, of, the, taiping, that, they, had, a, hand, in, creating, separation, of, the, sexes, was, strictly, enforced, in, the, first, few, years, although, it, tapered, off, in, later, years, part, of, the, extremeness, came, from, a, mistranslation, of, the, ten, commandments, which, led, to, the, seventh, commandment, also, forbidding, licentiousness, as, well, as, adultery, it, was, so, severe, that, parents, and, children, of, the, opposite, sex, could, not, interact, and, even, married, couples, were, discouraged, from, having, sex, the, rebels, used, brilliant, unorthodox, strategies, that, nearly, toppled, the, dynasty, but, inspired, it, to, adopt, what, one, historian, calls, the, most, significant, military, experimentation, since, the, seventeenth, century, the, taiping, army, was, the, rebellion, s, key, strength, it, was, marked, by, a, high, level, of, discipline, and, fanaticism, they, typically, wore, a, uniform, of, red, jackets, with, blue, trousers, and, grew, their, hair, long, so, in, china, they, were, nicknamed, long, hair, in, the, beginning, of, the, rebellion, the, large, numbers, of, women, serving, in, the, taiping, army, also, distinguished, it, from, other, 19th, century, armies, however, after, 1853, there, ceased, being, many, women, in, the, taiping, army, hong, xuanjiao, su, sanniang, and, qiu, ersao, are, examples, of, women, who, became, leaders, of, the, taiping, army, s, female, soldiers, combat, was, always, bloody, and, extremely, brutal, with, little, artillery, but, huge, forces, equipped, with, small, arms, both, armies, would, attempt, to, push, each, other, off, of, the, battlefield, and, though, casualties, were, high, few, battles, were, decisively, won, the, taiping, army, s, main, strategy, of, conquest, was, to, take, major, cities, consolidate, their, hold, on, the, cities, then, march, out, into, the, surrounding, countryside, to, recruit, local, farmers, and, battle, government, forces, estimates, of, the, overall, size, of, the, taiping, army, are, around, 2, million, soldiers, the, army, s, organization, was, allegedly, inspired, by, that, of, the, qin, dynasty, each, army, corps, consisted, of, roughly, 13, 000, men, these, corps, were, placed, into, armies, of, varying, sizes, in, addition, to, the, main, taiping, forces, organised, along, the, above, lines, there, were, also, thousands, of, pro, taiping, groups, fielding, their, own, forces, of, irregulars, the, rebels, were, relatively, well, equipped, with, modern, weapons, they, were, not, supported, by, foreign, governments, but, they, bought, modern, munitions, including, firearms, artillery, and, ammunition, from, foreign, suppliers, the, rebels, were, buying, weapons, by, 1853, munitions, partially, sourced, from, western, manufacturers, and, military, stores, were, smuggled, into, china, mainly, by, english, and, americans, an, april, 1862, shipment, from, an, american, dealer, well, known, for, their, dealings, with, rebels, included, 2, 783, percussion, cap, muskets, 66, carbines, 4, rifles, and, 895, field, artillery, guns, the, dealer, carried, passports, signed, by, the, loyal, king, the, rebels, also, manufactured, weapons, and, imported, manufacturing, equipment, in, the, summer, of, 1862, a, western, observer, noted, that, rebel, factories, in, nanjing, were, producing, superior, guns, including, heavy, cannon, than, the, qing, the, rebels, augmented, their, modern, arsenal, with, captured, equipment, just, before, his, execution, taiping, loyal, king, li, xiucheng, advised, the, qing, to, buy, and, to, learn, how, to, replicate, the, best, foreign, cannon, and, gun, carriages, to, prepare, for, war, with, foreign, powers, as, early, as, 1853, foreigners, from, various, countries, joined, the, rebels, in, combat, and, administrative, roles, and, were, in, a, position, to, observe, the, taiping, in, battle, the, rebels, were, courageous, under, fire, erected, defensive, works, quickly, and, used, mobile, pontoon, bridges, one, tactic, was, to, ring, a, qing, emplacement, in, fire, and, kill, the, fleeing, qing, troops, as, they, emerged, individually, there, was, also, a, small, taiping, navy, composed, of, captured, boats, that, operated, along, the, yangtze, and, its, tributaries, among, the, navy, s, commanders, was, the, hang, king, tang, zhengcai, ethnically, the, taiping, army, was, at, the, outset, formed, largely, from, these, groups, the, hakka, a, han, chinese, subgroup, the, cantonese, local, residents, of, guangdong, and, the, zhuang, a, non, han, ethnic, group, it, is, no, coincidence, that, hong, xiuquan, and, the, other, taiping, royals, were, hakka, as, a, han, subgroup, the, hakka, were, frequently, marginalised, economically, and, politically, having, migrated, to, the, regions, which, their, descendants, presently, inhabit, only, after, other, han, groups, were, already, established, there, for, example, when, the, hakka, settled, in, guangdong, and, parts, of, guangxi, yue, chinese, speakers, were, already, the, dominant, regional, han, group, there, and, they, had, been, so, for, some, time, just, as, speakers, of, various, dialects, of, min, are, locally, dominant, in, fujian, province, the, hakka, settled, throughout, southern, china, and, beyond, but, as, latecomers, they, generally, had, to, establish, their, communities, on, rugged, less, fertile, land, scattered, on, the, fringes, of, the, local, majority, group, s, settlements, as, their, name, guest, households, suggests, the, hakka, were, generally, treated, as, migrant, newcomers, and, often, subjected, to, hostility, and, derision, from, the, local, majority, han, populations, consequently, the, hakka, to, a, greater, extent, than, other, han, chinese, have, been, historically, associated, with, popular, unrest, and, rebellion, the, other, significant, ethnic, group, in, the, taiping, army, was, the, zhuang, an, indigenous, people, of, tai, origin, and, china, s, largest, non, han, ethnic, minority, group, over, the, centuries, zhuang, communities, had, been, adopting, han, chinese, culture, this, was, possible, because, han, culture, in, the, region, accommodates, a, great, deal, of, linguistic, diversity, so, the, zhuang, could, be, absorbed, as, if, the, zhuang, language, were, just, another, han, chinese, dialect, which, it, is, not, because, zhuang, communities, were, integrating, with, the, han, at, different, rates, a, certain, amount, of, friction, between, the, han, and, the, zhuang, was, inevitable, with, zhuang, unrest, leading, to, armed, uprisings, on, occasion, socially, and, economically, the, taiping, rebels, came, almost, exclusively, from, the, lowest, classes, many, of, the, southern, taiping, troops, were, former, miners, especially, those, coming, from, the, zhuang, very, few, taiping, rebels, even, in, the, leadership, caste, came, from, the, imperial, bureaucracy, almost, none, were, landlords, and, in, occupied, territories, landlords, were, often, executed, opposing, the, rebellion, was, an, imperial, army, with, over, a, million, regulars, and, unknown, thousands, of, regional, militias, and, foreign, mercenaries, operating, in, support, among, the, imperial, forces, was, the, elite, ever, victorious, army, consisting, of, chinese, soldiers, led, by, a, western, officer, corps, see, frederick, townsend, ward, and, charles, gordon, and, supplied, by, european, arms, companies, like, willoughbe, ponsonby, a, particularly, famous, imperial, force, was, zeng, guofan, s, xiang, army, zuo, zongtang, from, hunan, province, was, another, important, qing, general, who, contributed, in, suppressing, the, taiping, rebellion, where, the, armies, under, the, control, of, dynasty, itself, were, unable, to, defeat, the, taiping, these, gentry, led, yong, ying, armies, were, able, to, succeed, although, keeping, accurate, records, was, something, imperial, china, traditionally, did, very, well, the, decentralized, nature, of, the, imperial, war, effort, relying, on, regional, forces, and, the, fact, that, the, war, was, a, civil, war, and, therefore, very, chaotic, meant, that, reliable, figures, are, impossible, to, find, the, destruction, of, the, taiping, heavenly, kingdom, also, meant, that, the, majority, of, any, records, it, possessed, were, destroyed, the, percentage, of, records, said, to, have, survived, is, around, 10, over, the, course, of, the, conflict, around, 90, of, recruits, to, the, taiping, side, would, be, killed, or, defect, aside, from, local, militias, the, organisation, of, the, qing, army, was, the, taiping, rebellion, was, a, total, war, almost, every, citizen, who, had, not, fled, the, taiping, heavenly, kingdom, was, given, military, training, and, conscripted, into, the, army, to, fight, against, qing, imperial, forces, under, the, taiping, household, registration, system, one, adult, male, from, each, household, was, to, be, conscripted, into, the, army, during, this, conflict, both, sides, tried, to, deprive, each, other, of, the, resources, which, they, needed, in, order, to, continue, the, war, and, it, became, standard, practice, for, each, to, destroy, the, opposing, side, s, agricultural, areas, butcher, the, populations, of, cities, and, generally, exact, a, brutal, price, from, the, inhabitants, of, captured, enemy, lands, in, order, to, drastically, weaken, the, opposition, s, war, effort, this, war, was, total, in, the, sense, that, civilians, on, both, sides, participated, in, the, war, effort, to, a, significant, extent, and, the, armies, on, both, sides, waged, war, against, both, the, civilian, population, and, military, forces, contemporary, accounts, describe, the, amount, of, desolation, which, befell, rural, areas, as, a, result, of, the, conflict, in, every, area, which, they, captured, the, taiping, immediately, exterminated, the, entire, manchu, population, in, the, province, of, hunan, one, qing, loyalist, who, observed, the, genocidal, massacres, which, the, taiping, forces, committed, against, the, manchus, wrote, that, the, pitiful, manchus, men, women, and, children, were, executed, by, the, taiping, forces, the, taiping, rebels, were, seen, chanting, while, slaughtering, the, manchus, in, hefei, after, capturing, nanjing, taiping, forces, killed, about, 40, 000, manchu, civilians, on, 27, october, 1853, they, crossed, the, yellow, river, in, cangzhou, and, murdered, 10, 000, manchus, since, the, rebellion, began, in, guangxi, qing, forces, allowed, no, rebels, speaking, its, dialect, to, surrender, reportedly, in, the, province, of, guangdong, it, is, written, that, one, million, were, executed, because, after, the, collapse, of, the, taiping, heavenly, kingdom, the, qing, dynasty, launched, waves, of, massacres, against, the, hakkas, that, at, their, height, killed, up, to, 30, 000, each, day, these, policies, of, mass, murder, of, civilians, occurred, elsewhere, in, china, including, anhui, and, nanjing, this, resulted, in, a, massive, civilian, flight, and, death, toll, with, some, 600, towns, destroyed, and, other, bloody, policies, resulting, beyond, staggering, human, and, economic, devastation, the, taiping, rebellion, left, changes, within, the, late, qing, dynasty, power, was, to, a, limited, extent, decentralized, and, ethnic, han, chinese, officials, were, more, widely, employed, in, high, positions, than, they, had, previously, been, the, traditional, manchu, banner, forces, upon, which, the, qing, dynasty, depended, failed, and, were, gradually, replaced, with, gentry, organized, local, armies, franz, h, michael, wrote, that, these, evolved, into, armies, used, by, local, warlords, who, dominated, china, after, the, fall, of, the, qing, dynasty, diana, lary, however, in, a, review, of, the, field, article, cited, studies, that, were, skeptical, of, these, claims, since, the, armies, created, to, put, down, the, taiping, operated, in, a, different, context, from, later, regional, armies, the, taiping, example, of, insurgent, organization, and, its, mix, of, christianity, and, radical, social, equality, influenced, sun, yat, sen, and, other, future, revolutionaries, some, taiping, veterans, joined, the, revive, china, society, whose, christian, members, organized, short, lived, heavenly, kingdom, of, the, great, mingshun, in, 1903, although, karl, marx, wrote, several, articles, about, the, taipings, he, did, not, perceive, a, social, program, or, agenda, for, change, only, violence, and, destruction, chinese, communist, historians, following, the, lead, of, mao, zedong, however, characterized, the, rebellion, as, a, proto, communist, uprising, both, communist, and,

this, day, because, they, were, mostly, destroyed, by, the, qing, in, an, attempt, to, rewrite, the, history, of, the, conflict, historian, john, king, fairbank, compares, the, taiping, rebels, with, the, communists, under, mao, zedong, who, came, to, power, a, century, later, in, addition, to, the, zeal, vigor, and, puritanical, discipline, so, often, found, in, new, political, movements, they,

historian, prescott, clarke, westerners, in, china, became, separated, into, two, different, groups, in, regards, to, their, views, on, the, rebellion, with, one, side, depicting, the, rebels, as, mere, robbers, whose, intention, was, to, gather, wealth, through, revolting, against, the, qing, and, the, other, side, depicting, the, rebel, army, as, religious, fanatics, provoked, by, skillful, leaders, to, fight, against, the, qing, to, the, death, the, government, officials, of, the, western, powers, were, optimistic, about, the, taiping, government, s, chance, of, victory, in, the, early, stages, according, to, historian, eugene, p, boardman, the, qing, dynasty, s, enforcement, of, the, treaty, of, 1842, 1844, was, frustrating, us, and, british, officials, especially, in, terms, of, open, trade, according, to, boardman, the, christian, nature, of, the, taiping, opened, up, the, possibility, for, a, more, cooperative, trade, partnership, many, western, officials, visited, the, capital, of, taiping, between, 1863, and, 1864, and, american, commissioner, robert, milligan, mclane, considered, granting, official, recognition, of, the, taiping, government, according, to, clarke, the, western, missionaries, changed, their, opinions, upon, further, inspections, of, the, rebellion, that, change, was, captured, in, a, letter, from, the, american, missionary, divie, bethune,

the, city, of, shanghai, a, proposal, which, was, refused, by, the, taiping, government, according, to, clarke, this, refusal, of, cooperation, and, taiping, s, occupation, of, ningbo, in, december, led, to, the, limited, intervention, against, the, rebellion, by, the, british, and, french, in, the, following, years, western, assistance, for, the, qing, was, also, driven, by, the, fear, that, a,
