mesoamerica, is, a, historical, region, and, cultural, area, that, begins, in, the, southern, part, of, north, america, and, extends, to, the, pacific, coast, of, central, america, thus, comprising, the, lands, of, central, and, southern, mexico, all, of, belize, guatemala, el, salvador, and, parts, of, honduras, nicaragua, and, costa, rica, as, a, cultural, area, mesoamerica, is, defined, by, a, mosaic, of, cultural, traits, developed, and, shared, by, its, indigenous, cultures, in, the, pre, columbian, era, many, indigenous, societies, flourished, in, mesoamerica, for, more, than, 3, 000, years, before, the, spanish, colonization, of, the, americas, began, on, hispaniola, in, 1493, in, world, history, mesoamerica, was, the, site, of, two, historical, transformations, i, primary, urban, generation, and, ii, the, formation, of, new, world, cultures, from, the, mixtures, of, the, indigenous, mesoamerican, peoples, with, the, european, african, and, asian, peoples, who, were, introduced, by, the, spanish, colonization, of, the, americas, mesoamerica, is, one, of, the, six, areas, in, the, world, where, ancient, civilization, arose, independently, see, cradle, of, civilization, and, the, second, in, the, americas, alongside, the, caral, supe, in, present, day, peru, mesoamerica, is, also, one, of, only, five, regions, of, the, world, where, writing, is, known, to, have, independently, developed, the, others, being, ancient, egypt, india, sumer, and, china, beginning, as, early, as, 7000, bce, the, domestication, of, cacao, maize, beans, tomato, avocado, vanilla, squash, and, chili, as, well, as, the, turkey, and, dog, resulted, in, a, transition, from, paleo, indian, hunter, gatherer, tribal, groupings, to, the, organization, of, sedentary, agricultural, villages, in, the, subsequent, formative, period, agriculture, and, cultural, traits, such, as, a, complex, mythological, and, religious, tradition, a, vigesimal, numeric, system, a, complex, calendric, system, a, tradition, of, ball, playing, and, a, distinct, architectural, style, were, diffused, through, the, area, villages, began, to, become, socially, stratified, and, develop, into, chiefdoms, and, large, ceremonial, centers, were, built, interconnected, by, a, network, of, trade, routes, for, the, exchange, of, luxury, goods, such, as, obsidian, jade, cacao, cinnabar, spondylus, shells, hematite, and, ceramics, while, mesoamerican, civilization, knew, of, the, wheel, and, basic, metallurgy, neither, of, these, became, technologically, relevant, among, the, earliest, complex, civilizations, was, the, olmec, culture, which, inhabited, the, gulf, coast, of, mexico, and, extended, inland, and, southwards, across, the, isthmus, of, tehuantepec, frequent, contact, and, cultural, interchange, between, the, early, olmec, and, other, cultures, in, chiapas, oaxaca, and, guatemala, laid, the, basis, for, the, mesoamerican, cultural, area, all, this, was, facilitated, by, considerable, regional, communications, in, ancient, mesoamerica, especially, along, the, pacific, coast, in, the, subsequent, preclassic, period, complex, urban, polities, began, to, develop, among, the, maya, with, the, rise, of, centers, such, as, aguada, f, nix, and, calakmul, in, mexico, el, mirador, and, tikal, in, guatemala, and, the, zapotec, at, monte, alb, n, during, this, period, the, first, true, mesoamerican, writing, systems, were, developed, in, the, epi, olmec, and, the, zapotec, cultures, the, mesoamerican, writing, tradition, reached, its, height, in, the, classic, maya, logosyllabic, script, in, central, mexico, the, city, of, teotihuacan, ascended, at, the, height, of, the, classic, period, it, formed, a, military, and, commercial, empire, whose, political, influence, stretched, south, into, the, maya, area, and, northward, upon, the, collapse, of, teotihuac, n, around, 600, ad, competition, between, several, important, political, centers, in, central, mexico, such, as, xochicalco, and, cholula, ensued, at, this, time, during, the, epi, classic, period, the, nahua, peoples, began, moving, south, into, mesoamerica, from, the, north, and, became, politically, and, culturally, dominant, in, central, mexico, as, they, displaced, speakers, of, oto, manguean, languages, during, the, early, post, classic, period, central, mexico, was, dominated, by, the, toltec, culture, and, oaxaca, by, the, mixtec, the, lowland, maya, area, had, important, centers, at, chich, n, itz, and, mayap, n, towards, the, end, of, the, post, classic, period, the, aztecs, of, central, mexico, built, a, tributary, empire, covering, most, of, central, mesoamerica, the, distinct, mesoamerican, cultural, tradition, ended, with, the, spanish, conquest, in, the, 16th, century, eurasian, diseases, such, as, smallpox, and, measles, which, were, endemic, among, the, colonists, but, new, to, north, america, caused, the, deaths, of, upwards, of, 90, of, the, indigenous, people, resulting, in, great, losses, to, their, societies, and, cultures, over, the, next, centuries, mesoamerican, indigenous, cultures, were, gradually, subjected, to, spanish, colonial, rule, aspects, of, the, mesoamerican, cultural, heritage, still, survive, among, the, indigenous, peoples, who, inhabit, mesoamerica, many, continue, to, speak, their, ancestral, languages, and, maintain, many, practices, hearkening, back, to, their, mesoamerican, roots, the, term, mesoamerica, literally, means, middle, america, in, greek, middle, america, often, refers, to, a, larger, area, in, the, americas, but, it, has, also, previously, been, used, more, narrowly, to, refer, to, mesoamerica, an, example, is, the, title, of, the, 16, volumes, of, the, handbook, of, middle, american, indians, mesoamerica, is, broadly, defined, as, the, area, that, is, home, to, the, mesoamerican, civilization, which, comprises, a, group, of, peoples, with, close, cultural, and, historical, ties, the, exact, geographic, extent, of, mesoamerica, has, varied, through, time, as, the, civilization, extended, north, and, south, from, its, heartland, in, southern, mexico, the, term, was, first, used, by, the, german, ethnologist, paul, kirchhoff, who, noted, that, similarities, existed, among, the, various, pre, columbian, cultures, within, the, region, that, included, southern, mexico, guatemala, belize, el, salvador, western, honduras, and, the, pacific, lowlands, of, nicaragua, and, northwestern, costa, rica, in, the, tradition, of, cultural, history, the, prevalent, archaeological, theory, of, the, early, to, middle, 20th, century, kirchhoff, defined, this, zone, as, a, cultural, area, based, on, a, suite, of, interrelated, cultural, similarities, brought, about, by, millennia, of, inter, and, intra, regional, interaction, i, e, diffusion, mesoamerica, is, recognized, as, a, near, prototypical, cultural, area, this, term, is, now, fully, integrated, into, the, standard, terminology, of, precolumbian, anthropological, studies, conversely, the, sister, terms, aridoamerica, and, oasisamerica, which, refer, to, northern, mexico, and, the, western, united, states, respectively, have, not, entered, into, widespread, usage, some, of, the, significant, cultural, traits, defining, the, mesoamerican, cultural, tradition, are, located, on, the, middle, american, isthmus, joining, north, and, south, america, between, ca, 10, and, 22, northern, latitude, mesoamerica, possesses, a, complex, combination, of, ecological, systems, topographic, zones, and, environmental, contexts, these, different, niches, are, classified, into, two, broad, categories, the, lowlands, those, areas, between, sea, level, and, 1000, meters, and, the, altiplanos, or, highlands, situated, between, 1, 000, and, 2, 000, meters, above, sea, level, in, the, low, lying, regions, sub, tropical, and, tropical, climates, are, most, common, as, is, true, for, most, of, the, coastline, along, the, pacific, and, gulf, of, mexico, and, the, caribbean, sea, the, highlands, show, much, more, climatic, diversity, ranging, from, dry, tropical, to, cold, mountainous, climates, the, dominant, climate, is, temperate, with, warm, temperatures, and, moderate, rainfall, the, rainfall, varies, from, the, dry, oaxaca, and, north, yucat, n, to, the, humid, southern, pacific, and, caribbean, lowlands, several, distinct, sub, regions, within, mesoamerica, are, defined, by, a, convergence, of, geographic, and, cultural, attributes, these, sub, regions, are, more, conceptual, than, culturally, meaningful, and, the, demarcation, of, their, limits, is, not, rigid, the, maya, area, for, example, can, be, divided, into, two, general, groups, the, lowlands, and, highlands, the, lowlands, are, further, divided, into, the, southern, and, northern, maya, lowlands, the, southern, maya, lowlands, are, generally, regarded, as, encompassing, northern, guatemala, southern, campeche, and, quintana, roo, in, mexico, and, belize, the, northern, lowlands, cover, the, remainder, of, the, northern, portion, of, the, yucat, n, peninsula, other, areas, include, central, mexico, west, mexico, the, gulf, coast, lowlands, oaxaca, the, southern, pacific, lowlands, and, southeast, mesoamerica, including, northern, honduras, there, is, extensive, topographic, variation, in, mesoamerica, ranging, from, the, high, peaks, circumscribing, the, valley, of, mexico, and, within, the, central, sierra, madre, mountains, to, the, low, flatlands, of, the, northern, yucat, n, peninsula, the, tallest, mountain, in, mesoamerica, is, pico, de, orizaba, a, dormant, volcano, located, on, the, border, of, puebla, and, veracruz, its, peak, elevation, is, 5, 636, m, 18, 490, ft, the, sierra, madre, mountains, which, consist, of, several, smaller, ranges, run, from, northern, mesoamerica, south, through, costa, rica, the, chain, is, historically, volcanic, in, central, and, southern, mexico, a, portion, of, the, sierra, madre, chain, is, known, as, the, eje, volc, nico, transversal, or, the, trans, mexican, volcanic, belt, there, are, 83, inactive, and, active, volcanoes, within, the, sierra, madre, range, including, 11, in, mexico, 37, in, guatemala, 23, in, el, salvador, 25, in, nicaragua, and, 3, in, northwestern, costa, rica, according, to, the, michigan, technological, university, 16, of, these, are, still, active, the, tallest, active, volcano, is, popocat, petl, at, 5, 452, m, 17, 887, ft, this, volcano, which, retains, its, nahuatl, name, is, located, 70, km, 43, mi, southeast, of, mexico, city, other, volcanoes, of, note, include, tacana, on, the, mexico, guatemala, border, tajumulco, and, santamar, a, in, guatemala, izalco, in, el, salvador, arenal, in, costa, rica, and, concepci, n, and, maderas, on, ometepe, which, is, an, island, formed, by, both, volcanoes, rising, out, of, lake, cocibolca, in, nicaragua, one, important, topographic, feature, is, the, isthmus, of, tehuantepec, a, low, plateau, that, breaks, up, the, sierra, madre, chain, between, the, sierra, madre, del, sur, to, the, north, and, the, sierra, madre, de, chiapas, to, the, south, at, its, highest, point, the, isthmus, is, 224, m, 735, ft, above, mean, sea, level, this, area, also, represents, the, shortest, distance, between, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, the, pacific, ocean, in, mexico, the, distance, between, the, two, coasts, is, roughly, 200, km, 120, mi, the, northern, side, of, the, isthmus, is, swampy, and, covered, in, dense, jungle, but, the, isthmus, of, tehuantepec, as, the, lowest, and, most, level, point, within, the, sierra, madre, mountain, chain, was, nonetheless, a, main, transportation, communication, and, economic, route, within, mesoamerica, outside, of, the, northern, maya, lowlands, rivers, are, common, throughout, mesoamerica, some, of, the, more, important, ones, served, as, loci, of, human, occupation, in, the, area, the, longest, river, in, mesoamerica, is, the, usumacinta, which, forms, in, guatemala, at, the, convergence, of, the, salinas, or, chixoy, and, la, pasion, river, and, runs, north, for, 970, km, 600, mi, 480, km, 300, mi, of, which, are, navigable, eventually, draining, into, the, gulf, of, mexico, other, rivers, of, note, include, the, rio, grande, de, santiago, the, grijalva, river, the, motagua, river, the, ul, a, river, and, the, hondo, river, the, northern, maya, lowlands, especially, the, northern, portion, of, the, yucat, n, peninsula, are, notable, for, their, nearly, complete, lack, of, rivers, largely, due, to, the, absolute, lack, of, topographic, variation, additionally, no, lakes, exist, in, the, northern, peninsula, the, main, source, of, water, in, this, area, is, aquifers, that, are, accessed, through, natural, surface, openings, called, cenotes, with, an, area, of, 8, 264, km, 2, 3, 191, sq, mi, lake, nicaragua, is, the, largest, lake, in, mesoamerica, lake, chapala, is, mexico, s, largest, freshwater, lake, but, lake, texcoco, is, perhaps, most, well, known, as, the, location, upon, which, tenochtitlan, capital, of, the, aztec, empire, was, founded, lake, pet, n, itz, in, northern, guatemala, is, notable, as, where, the, last, independent, maya, city, tayasal, or, noh, pet, n, held, out, against, the, spanish, until, 1697, other, large, lakes, include, lake, atitl, n, lake, izabal, lake, g, ija, lemoa, and, lake, xolotlan, almost, all, ecosystems, are, present, in, mesoamerica, the, more, well, known, are, the, mesoamerican, barrier, reef, system, the, second, largest, in, the, world, and, la, mosquitia, consisting, of, the, rio, platano, biosphere, reserve, tawahka, asangni, patuca, national, park, and, bosawas, biosphere, reserve, a, rainforest, second, in, size, in, the, americas, only, to, the, amazonas, the, highlands, present, mixed, and, coniferous, forest, the, biodiversity, is, among, the, richest, in, the, world, though, the, number, of, species, in, the, red, list, of, the, iucn, grows, every, year, the, history, of, human, occupation, in, mesoamerica, is, divided, into, stages, or, periods, these, are, known, with, slight, variation, depending, on, region, as, the, paleo, indian, the, archaic, the, preclassic, or, formative, the, classic, and, the, postclassic, the, last, three, periods, representing, the, core, of, mesoamerican, cultural, fluorescence, are, further, divided, into, two, or, three, sub, phases, most, of, the, time, following, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, in, the, 16th, century, is, classified, as, the, colonial, period, the, differentiation, of, early, periods, i, e, up, through, the, end, of, the, late, preclassic, generally, reflects, different, configurations, of, socio, cultural, organization, that, are, characterized, by, increasing, socio, political, complexity, the, adoption, of, new, and, different, subsistence, strategies, and, changes, in, economic, organization, including, increased, interregional, interaction, the, classic, period, through, the, postclassic, are, differentiated, by, the, cyclical, crystallization, and, fragmentation, of, the, various, political, entities, throughout, mesoamerica, the, mesoamerican, paleo, indian, period, precedes, the, advent, of, agriculture, and, is, characterized, by, a, nomadic, hunting, and, gathering, subsistence, strategy, big, game, hunting, similar, to, that, seen, in, contemporaneous, north, america, was, a, large, component, of, the, subsistence, strategy, of, the, mesoamerican, paleo, indian, these, sites, had, obsidian, blades, and, clovis, style, fluted, projectile, points, the, archaic, period, 8000, 2000, bce, is, characterized, by, the, rise, of, incipient, agriculture, in, mesoamerica, the, initial, phases, of, the, archaic, involved, the, cultivation, of, wild, plants, transitioning, into, informal, domestication, and, culminating, with, sedentism, and, agricultural, production, by, the, close, of, the, period, transformations, of, natural, environments, have, been, a, common, feature, at, least, since, the, mid, holocene, archaic, sites, include, sipacate, in, escuintla, guatemala, where, maize, pollen, samples, date, to, c, 3500, bce, the, first, complex, civilization, to, develop, in, mesoamerica, was, that, of, the, olmec, who, inhabited, the, gulf, coast, region, of, veracruz, throughout, the, preclassic, period, the, main, sites, of, the, olmec, include, san, lorenzo, tenochtitl, n, la, venta, and, tres, zapotes, specific, dates, vary, but, these, sites, were, occupied, from, roughly, 1200, to, 400, bce, remains, of, other, early, cultures, interacting, with, the, olmec, have, been, found, at, takalik, abaj, izapa, and, teopantecuanitlan, and, as, far, south, as, in, honduras, research, in, the, pacific, lowlands, of, chiapas, and, guatemala, suggest, that, izapa, and, the, monte, alto, culture, may, have, preceded, the, olmec, radiocarbon, samples, associated, with, various, sculptures, found, at, the, late, preclassic, site, of, izapa, suggest, a, date, of, between, 1800, and, 1500, bce, during, the, middle, and, late, preclassic, period, the, maya, civilization, developed, in, the, southern, maya, highlands, and, lowlands, and, at, a, few, sites, in, the, northern, maya, lowlands, the, earliest, maya, sites, coalesced, after, 1000, bce, and, include, nakbe, el, mirador, and, cerros, middle, to, late, preclassic, maya, sites, include, kaminaljuy, cival, edzn, cob, lamanai, komchen, dzibilchaltun, and, san, bartolo, among, others, the, preclassic, in, the, central, mexican, highlands, is, represented, by, such, sites, as, tlapacoya, tlatilco, and, cuicuilco, these, sites, were, eventually, superseded, by, teotihuac, n, an, important, classic, era, site, that, eventually, dominated, economic, and, interaction, spheres, throughout, mesoamerica, the, settlement, of, teotihuacan, is, dated, to, the, later, portion, of, the, late, preclassic, or, roughly, 50, ce, in, the, valley, of, oaxaca, san, jos, mogote, represents, one, of, the, oldest, permanent, agricultural, villages, in, the, area, and, one, of, the, first, to, use, pottery, during, the, early, and, middle, preclassic, the, site, developed, some, of, the, earliest, examples, of, defensive, palisades, ceremonial, structures, the, use, of, adobe, and, hieroglyphic, writing, also, of, importance, the, site, was, one, of, the, first, to, demonstrate, inherited, status, signifying, a, radical, shift, in, socio, cultural, and, political, structure, san, jos, mogote, was, eventually, overtaken, by, monte, alb, n, the, subsequent, capital, of, the, zapotec, empire, during, the, late, preclassic, the, preclassic, in, western, mexico, in, the, states, of, nayarit, jalisco, colima, and, michoac, n, also, known, as, the, occidente, is, poorly, understood, this, period, is, best, represented, by, the, thousands, of, figurines, recovered, by, looters, and, ascribed, to, the, shaft, tomb, tradition, the, classic, period, is, marked, by, the, rise, and, dominance, of, several, polities, the, traditional, distinction, between, the, early, and, late, classic, is, marked, by, their, changing, fortune, and, their, ability, to, maintain, regional, primacy, of, paramount, importance, are, teotihuac, n, in, central, mexico, and, tikal, in, guatemala, the, early, classic, s, temporal, limits, generally, correlate, to, the, main, periods, of, these, sites, monte, alb, n, in, oaxaca, is, another, classic, period, polity, that, expanded, and, flourished, during, this, period, but, the, zapotec, capital, exerted, less, interregional, influence, than, the, other, two, sites, during, the, early, classic, teotihuacan, participated, in, and, perhaps, dominated, a, far, reaching, macro, regional, interaction, network, architectural, and, artifact, styles, talud, tablero, tripod, slab, footed, ceramic, vessels, epitomized, at, teotihuacan, were, mimicked, and, adopted, at, many, distant, settlements, pachuca, obsidian, whose, trade, and, distribution, is, argued, to, have, been, economically, controlled, by, teotihuacan, is, found, throughout, mesoamerica, tikal, came, to, dominate, much, of, the, southern, maya, lowlands, politically, economically, and, militarily, during, the, early, classic, an, exchange, network, centered, at, tikal, distributed, a, variety, of, goods, and, commodities, throughout, southeast, mesoamerica, such, as, obsidian, imported, from, central, mexico, e, g, pachuca, and, highland, guatemala, e, g, el, chayal, which, was, predominantly, used, by, the, maya, during, the, early, classic, and, jade, from, the, motagua, valley, in, guatemala, tikal, was, often, in, conflict, with, other, polities, in, the, pet, n, basin, as, well, as, with, others, outside, of, it, including, uaxactun, caracol, dos, pilas, naranjo, and, calakmul, towards, the, end, of, the, early, classic, this, conflict, lead, to, tikal, s, military, defeat, at, the, hands, of, caracol, in, 562, and, a, period, commonly, known, as, the, tikal, hiatus, the, late, classic, period, beginning, c, 600, ce, until, 909, ce, is, characterized, as, a, period, of, interregional, competition, and, factionalization, among, the, numerous, regional, polities, in, the, maya, area, this, largely, resulted, from, the, decrease, in, tikal, s, socio, political, and, economic, power, at, the, beginning, of, the, period, it, was, therefore, during, this, time, that, other, sites, rose, to, regional, prominence, and, were, able, to, exert, greater, interregional, influence, including, caracol, cop, n, palenque, and, calakmul, which, was, allied, with, caracol, and, may, have, assisted, in, the, defeat, of, tikal, and, dos, pilas, aguateca, and, cancu, n, in, the, petexbat, n, region, of, guatemala, around, 710, tikal, arose, again, and, started, to, build, strong, alliances, and, defeat, its, worst, enemies, in, the, maya, area, the, late, classic, ended, with, the, so, called, maya, collapse, a, transitional, period, coupling, the, general, depopulation, of, the, southern, lowlands, and, development, and, florescence, of, centers, in, the, northern, lowlands, generally, applied, to, the, maya, area, the, terminal, classic, roughly, spans, the, time, between, c, 800, 850, and, c, 1000, ad, overall, it, generally, correlates, with, the, rise, to, prominence, of, puuc, settlements, in, the, northern, maya, lowlands, so, named, after, the, hills, where, they, are, mainly, found, puuc, settlements, are, specifically, associated, with, a, unique, architectural, style, the, puuc, architectural, style, that, represents, a, technological, departure, from, previous, construction, techniques, major, puuc, sites, include, uxmal, sayil, labna, kabah, and, oxkintok, while, generally, concentrated, within, the, area, in, and, around, the, puuc, hills, the, style, has, been, documented, as, far, away, as, at, chichen, itza, to, the, east, and, edzna, to, the, south, chich, n, itz, was, originally, thought, to, have, been, a, postclassic, site, in, the, northern, maya, lowlands, research, over, the, past, few, decades, has, established, that, it, was, first, settled, during, the, early, late, classic, transition, but, rose, to, prominence, during, the, terminal, classic, and, early, postclassic, during, its, apogee, this, widely, known, site, economically, and, politically, dominated, the, northern, lowlands, its, participation, in, the, circum, peninsular, exchange, route, possible, through, its, port, site, of, isla, cerritos, allowed, chich, n, itz, to, remain, highly, connected, to, areas, such, as, central, mexico, and, central, america, the, apparent, mexicanization, of, architecture, at, chich, n, itz, led, past, researchers, to, believe, that, chich, n, itz, existed, under, the, control, of, a, toltec, empire, chronological, data, refutes, this, early, interpretation, and, it, is, now, known, that, chich, n, itz, predated, the, toltec, mexican, architectural, styles, are, now, used, as, an, indicator, of, strong, economic, and, ideological, ties, between, the, two, regions, the, postclassic, beginning, 900, 1000, ce, depending, on, area, is, like, the, late, classic, characterized, by, the, cyclical, crystallization, and, fragmentation, of, various, polities, the, main, maya, centers, were, located, in, the, northern, lowlands, following, chich, n, itz, whose, political, structure, collapsed, during, the, early, postclassic, mayap, n, rose, to, prominence, during, the, middle, postclassic, and, dominated, the, north, for, c, 200, years, after, mayap, n, s, fragmentation, the, political, structure, in, the, northern, lowlands, revolved, around, large, towns, or, city, states, such, as, oxkutzcab, and, ti, ho, m, rida, yucat, n, that, competed, with, one, another, tonin, in, the, chiapas, highlands, and, kaminaljuy, in, the, central, guatemala, highlands, were, important, southern, highland, maya, centers, the, latter, site, kaminaljuy, is, one, of, the, longest, occupied, sites, in, mesoamerica, and, was, continuously, inhabited, from, c, 800, bce, to, around, 1200, ce, other, important, highland, maya, groups, include, the, k, iche, of, utatl, n, the, mam, in, zaculeu, the, poqomam, in, mixco, viejo, and, the, kaqchikel, at, iximche, in, the, guatemalan, highlands, the, pipil, resided, in, el, salvador, the, nicarao, were, in, western, nicaragua, and, northwestern, costa, rica, and, the, ch, orti, were, in, eastern, guatemala, and, northwestern, honduras, in, central, mexico, the, early, portion, of, the, postclassic, correlates, with, the, rise, of, the, toltec, and, an, empire, based, at, their, capital, tula, also, known, as, tollan, cholula, initially, an, important, early, classic, center, contemporaneous, with, teotihuacan, maintained, its, political, structure, it, did, not, collapse, and, continued, to, function, as, a, regionally, important, center, during, the, postclassic, the, latter, portion, of, the, postclassic, is, generally, associated, with, the, rise, of, the, mexica, and, the, aztec, empire, one, of, the, more, commonly, known, cultural, groups, in, mesoamerica, the, aztec, politically, dominated, nearly, all, of, central, mexico, the, gulf, coast, mexico, s, southern, pacific, coast, chiapas, and, into, guatemala, oaxaca, and, guerrero, the, tarascans, also, known, as, the, p, urh, pecha, were, located, in, michoac, n, and, guerrero, with, their, capital, at, tzintzuntzan, the, tarascan, state, was, one, of, the, few, to, actively, and, continuously, resist, aztec, domination, during, the, late, postclassic, other, important, postclassic, cultures, in, mesoamerica, include, the, totonac, along, the, eastern, coast, in, the, modern, day, states, of, veracruz, puebla, and, hidalgo, the, huastec, resided, north, of, the, totonac, mainly, in, the, modern, day, states, of, tamaulipas, and, northern, veracruz, the, mixtec, and, zapotec, cultures, centered, at, mitla, and, zaachila, respectively, inhabited, oaxaca, the, postclassic, ends, with, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, and, their, subsequent, conquest, of, the, aztecs, between, 1519, and, 1521, many, other, cultural, groups, did, not, acquiesce, until, later, for, example, maya, groups, in, the, pet, n, area, including, the, itza, at, tayasal, and, the, kowoj, at, zacpeten, remained, independent, until, 1697, some, mesoamerican, cultures, never, achieved, dominant, status, or, left, impressive, archaeological, remains, but, are, nevertheless, noteworthy, these, include, the, otomi, mixe, zoque, groups, which, may, or, may, not, have, been, related, to, the, olmecs, the, northern, uto, aztecan, groups, often, referred, to, as, the, chichimeca, that, include, the, cora, and, huichol, the, chontales, the, huaves, and, the, pipil, xincan, and, lencan, peoples, of, central, america, central, american, area, los, naranjos, by, roughly, 6000, bce, hunter, gatherers, living, in, the, highlands, and, lowlands, of, mesoamerica, began, to, develop, agricultural, practices, with, early, cultivation, of, squash, and, chili, the, earliest, example, of, maize, dates, to, c, 4000, bce, and, comes, from, guil, naquitz, a, cave, in, oaxaca, earlier, maize, samples, have, been, documented, at, the, los, ladrones, cave, site, in, panama, c, 5500, bce, slightly, thereafter, semi, agrarian, communities, began, to, cultivate, other, crops, throughout, mesoamerica, maize, was, the, most, common, domesticate, but, the, common, bean, tepary, bean, scarlet, runner, bean, jicama, tomato, and, squash, all, became, common, cultivates, by, 3500, bce, at, the, same, time, these, communities, exploited, cotton, yucca, and, agave, for, fibers, and, textile, materials, by, 2000, bce, corn, was, the, staple, crop, in, the, region, and, remained, so, through, modern, times, the, ram, n, or, breadnut, tree, brosimum, alicastrum, was, an, occasional, substitute, for, maize, in, producing, flour, fruit, was, also, important, in, the, daily, diet, of, mesoamerican, cultures, some, of, the, main, ones, consumed, include, avocado, papaya, guava, mamey, zapote, and, annona, mesoamerica, lacked, animals, suitable, for, domestication, most, notably, domesticated, large, ungulates, the, lack, of, draft, animals, for, transportation, is, one, notable, difference, between, mesoamerica, and, the, cultures, of, the, south, american, andes, other, animals, including, the, duck, dogs, and, turkey, were, domesticated, turkey, was, the, first, to, be, domesticated, locally, around, 3500, bce, dogs, were, the, primary, source, of, animal, protein, in, ancient, mesoamerica, and, dog, bones, are, common, in, midden, deposits, throughout, the, region, societies, of, this, region, did, hunt, certain, wild, species, for, food, these, animals, included, deer, rabbit, birds, and, various, types, of, insects, they, also, hunted, for, luxury, items, such, as, feline, fur, and, bird, plumage, mesoamerican, cultures, that, lived, in, the, lowlands, and, coastal, plains, settled, down, in, agrarian, communities, somewhat, later, than, did, highland, cultures, because, there, was, a, greater, abundance, of, fruits, and, animals, in, these, areas, which, made, a, hunter, gatherer, lifestyle, more, attractive, fishing, also, was, a, major, provider, of, food, to, lowland, and, coastal, mesoamericans, creating, a, further, disincentive, to, settle, down, in, permanent, communities, ceremonial, centers, were, the, nuclei, of, mesoamerican, settlements, the, temples, provided, spatial, orientation, which, was, imparted, to, the, surrounding, town, the, cities, with, their, commercial, and, religious, centers, were, always, political, entities, somewhat, similar, to, the, european, city, state, and, each, person, could, identify, with, the, city, where, they, lived, ceremonial, centers, were, always, built, to, be, visible, pyramids, were, meant, to, stand, out, from, the, rest, of, the, city, to, represent, the, gods, and, their, powers, another, characteristic, feature, of, the, ceremonial, centers, is, historic, layers, all, the, ceremonial, edifices, were, built, in, various, phases, one, on, top, of, the, other, to, the, point, that, what, we, now, see, is, usually, the, last, stage, of, construction, ultimately, the, ceremonial, centers, were, the, architectural, translation, of, the, identity, of, each, city, as, represented, by, the, veneration, of, their, gods, and, masters, stelae, were, common, public, monuments, throughout, mesoamerica, and, served, to, commemorate, notable, successes, events, and, dates, associated, with, the, rulers, and, nobility, of, the, various, sites, given, that, mesoamerica, was, broken, into, numerous, and, diverse, ecological, niches, none, of, the, societies, that, inhabited, the, area, were, self, sufficient, although, very, long, distance, trade, was, common, only, for, very, rare, goods, or, luxury, materials, for, this, reason, from, the, last, centuries, of, the, archaic, period, 8000, bc, 1000, bc, onward, regions, compensated, for, the, environmental, inadequacies, by, specializing, in, the, extraction, of, certain, abundant, natural, resources, and, then, trading, them, for, necessary, unavailable, resources, through, established, commercial, trade, networks, the, following, is, a, list, of, some, of, the, specialized, resources, traded, from, the, various, mesoamerican, sub, regions, and, environmental, contexts, mesoamerican, architecture, is, the, collective, name, given, to, urban, ceremonial, and, public, structures, built, by, pre, columbian, civilizations, in, mesoamerica, although, very, different, in, styles, all, kinds, of, mesoamerican, architecture, show, some, kind, of, interrelation, due, to, very, significant, cultural, exchanges, that, occurred, during, thousands, of, years, among, the, most, well, known, structures, in, mesoamerica, the, flat, top, pyramids, are, a, landmark, feature, of, the, most, developed, urban, centers, two, characteristics, are, most, notable, in, mesoamerican, architecture, firstly, the, intimate, connection, between, geography, astronomy, and, architecture, very, often, urban, centers, or, even, single, buildings, are, aligned, to, cardinal, directions, and, or, along, particular, constellations, secondly, iconography, was, considered, integral, part, of, architecture, with, buildings, often, being, adorned, with, images, of, religious, and, cultural, significance, agriculturally, based, people, historically, divide, the, year, into, four, seasons, these, included, the, two, solstices, and, the, two, equinoxes, which, could, be, thought, of, as, the, four, directional, pillars, that, support, the, year, these, four, times, of, the, year, were, and, still, are, important, as, they, indicate, seasonal, changes, that, directly, impact, the, lives, of, mesoamerican, agriculturalists, the, maya, closely, observed, and, duly, recorded, the, seasonal, markers, they, prepared, almanacs, recording, past, and, recent, solar, and, lunar, eclipses, the, phases, of, the, moon, the, periods, of, venus, and, mars, the, movements, of, various, other, planets, and, conjunctions, of, celestial, bodies, these, almanacs, also, made, future, predictions, concerning, celestial, events, these, tables, are, remarkably, accurate, given, the, technology, available, and, indicate, a, significant, level, of, knowledge, among, maya, astronomers, among, the, many, types, of, calendars, the, maya, maintained, the, most, important, include, a, 260, day, cycle, a, 360, day, cycle, or, year, a, 365, day, cycle, or, year, a, lunar, cycle, and, a, venus, cycle, which, tracked, the, synodic, period, of, venus, maya, of, the, european, contact, period, said, that, knowing, the, past, aided, in, both, understanding, the, present, and, predicting, the, future, diego, de, landa, the, 260, day, cycle, was, a, calendar, to, govern, agriculture, observe, religious, holidays, mark, the, movements, of, celestial, bodies, and, memorialize, public, officials, the, 260, day, cycle, was, also, used, for, divination, and, like, the, catholic, calendar, of, saints, to, name, newborns, the, names, given, to, the, days, months, and, years, in, the, mesoamerican, calendar, came, for, the, most, part, from, animals, flowers, heavenly, bodies, and, cultural, concepts, that, held, symbolic, significance, in, mesoamerican, culture, this, calendar, was, used, throughout, the, history, of, mesoamerican, by, nearly, every, culture, even, today, several, maya, groups, in, guatemala, including, the, k, iche, q, eqchi, kaqchikel, and, the, mixe, people, of, oaxaca, continue, using, modernized, forms, of, the, mesoamerican, calendar, the, mesoamerican, scripts, deciphered, to, date, are, logosyllabic, combining, the, use, of, logograms, with, a, syllabary, and, they, are, often, called, hieroglyphic, scripts, five, or, six, different, scripts, have, been, documented, in, mesoamerica, but, archaeological, dating, methods, and, a, certain, degree, of, self, interest, create, difficulties, in, establishing, priority, and, thus, the, forebear, from, which, the, others, developed, the, best, documented, and, deciphered, mesoamerican, writing, system, and, therefore, the, most, widely, known, is, the, classic, maya, script, others, include, the, olmec, zapotec, and, epi, olmec, isthmian, writing, systems, an, extensive, mesoamerican, literature, has, been, conserved, partly, in, indigenous, scripts, and, partly, in, the, postinvasion, transcriptions, into, latin, script, the, other, glyphic, writing, systems, of, mesoamerica, and, their, interpretation, have, been, subject, to, much, debate, one, important, ongoing, discussion, regards, whether, non, maya, mesoamerican, texts, can, be, considered, examples, of, true, writing, or, whether, non, maya, mesoamerican, texts, are, best, understood, as, pictographic, conventions, that, express, ideas, specifically, religious, ones, but, don, t, represent, the, phonetics, of, spoken, language, mesoamerican, writing, is, found, in, several, mediums, including, large, stone, monuments, such, as, stelae, carved, directly, onto, architecture, carved, or, painted, over, stucco, e, g, murals, and, on, pottery, no, precolumbian, mesoamerican, society, is, known, to, have, had, widespread, literacy, and, literacy, was, probably, restricted, to, particular, social, classes, including, scribes, painters, merchants, and, the, nobility, the, mesoamerican, book, was, typically, written, with, brush, and, colored, inks, on, a, paper, prepared, from, the, inner, bark, of, the, ficus, amacus, the, book, consisted, of, a, long, strip, of, the, prepared, bark, which, was, folded, like, a, screenfold, to, define, individual, pages, the, pages, were, often, covered, and, protected, by, elaborately, carved, book, boards, some, books, were, composed, of, square, pages, while, others, were, composed, of, rectangular, pages, following, the, spanish, conquests, in, the, sixteenth, century, spanish, friars, taught, indigenous, scribes, to, write, their, languages, in, alphabetic, texts, many, oral, histories, of, the, prehispanic, period, were, subsequently, recorded, in, alphabetic, texts, the, indigenous, in, central, and, southern, mexico, continued, to, produce, written, texts, in, the, colonial, period, many, with, pictorial, elements, an, important, scholarly, reference, work, is, the, handbook, of, middle, american, indians, guide, to, ethnohistorical, sources, mesoamerican, codices, survive, from, the, aztec, maya, mixtec, and, zapotec, regions, mesoamerican, arithmetic, treated, numbers, as, having, both, literal, and, symbolic, value, the, result, of, the, dualistic, nature, that, characterized, mesoamerican, ideology, as, mentioned, the, mesoamerican, numbering, system, was, vigesimal, i, e, based, on, the, number, 20, in, representing, numbers, a, series, of, bars, and, dots, were, employed, dots, had, a, value, of, one, and, bars, had, a, value, of, five, this, type, of, arithmetic, was, combined, with, symbolic, numerology, 2, was, related, to, origins, as, all, origins, can, be, thought, of, as, doubling, 3, was, related, to, household, fire, 4, was, linked, to, the, four, corners, of, the, universe, 5, expressed, instability, 9, pertained, to, the, underworld, and, the, night, 13, was, the, number, for, light, 20, for, abundance, and, 400, for, infinity, the, concept, of, zero, was, also, used, and, its, representation, at, the, late, preclassic, occupation, of, tres, zapotes, is, one, of, the, earliest, uses, of, zero, in, human, history, mesoamerica, would, deserve, its, place, in, the, human, pantheon, if, its, inhabitants, had, only, created, maize, in, terms, of, harvest, weight, the, world, s, most, important, crop, but, the, inhabitants, of, mexico, and, northern, central, america, also, developed, tomatoes, now, basic, to, italian, cuisine, peppers, essential, to, thai, and, indian, food, all, the, world, s, squashes, except, for, a, few, domesticated, in, the, united, states, and, many, of, the, beans, on, dinner, plates, around, the, world, one, writer, estimated, these, indigenous, tribes, developed, three, fifths, of, the, crops, now, grown, in, cultivation, most, of, them, in, mesoamerica, having, secured, their, food, supply, the, mesoamerican, societies, turned, to, intellectual, pursuits, in, a, millennium, or, less, a, comparatively, short, time, they, invented, their, own, writing, astronomy, and, mathematics, including, the, zero, maize, played, an, important, role, in, mesoamerican, feasts, due, to, its, symbolic, meaning, and, abundance, gods, were, praised, and, named, after, companion, planting, was, practiced, in, various, forms, by, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, they, domesticated, squash, 8, 000, to, 10, 000, years, ago, then, maize, then, common, beans, forming, the, three, sisters, agricultural, technique, the, cornstalk, served, as, a, trellis, for, the, beans, to, climb, and, the, beans, fixed, nitrogen, benefitting, the, maize, fray, bernardino, de, sahag, n, collected, extensive, information, on, plants, animals, soil, types, among, other, matters, from, native, informants, in, book, 11, the, earthly, things, of, the, twelve, volume, general, history, of, the, things, of, new, spain, known, as, the, florentine, codex, compiled, in, the, third, quarter, of, the, sixteenth, century, bernardino, de, sahag, n, reported, the, ritualistic, use, of, psilocybe, mushrooms, known, to, the, aztecs, as, te, nan, catl, agglutinative, form, of, te, tl, god, sacred, and, nan, catl, mushroom, in, n, huatl, an, earlier, work, the, badianus, manuscript, or, libellus, de, medicinalibus, indorum, herbis, is, another, aztec, codex, with, written, text, and, illustrations, collected, from, the, indigenous, viewpoint, the, ancient, aztecs, used, a, variety, of, entheogens, within, their, society, evidence, shows, that, wild, animals, were, captured, and, traded, for, symbolic, and, ritual, purposes, shared, traits, in, mesoamerican, mythology, are, characterized, by, their, common, basis, as, a, religion, that, though, in, many, mesoamerican, groups, developed, into, complex, polytheistic, religious, systems, retained, some, shamanistic, elements, the, great, breadth, of, the, mesoamerican, pantheon, of, deities, is, due, to, the, incorporation, of, ideological, and, religious, elements, from, the, first, primitive, religion, of, fire, earth, water, and, nature, astral, divinities, the, sun, stars, constellations, and, venus, were, adopted, and, represented, in, anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, and, anthropozoomorphic, sculptures, and, in, day, to, day, objects, the, qualities, of, these, gods, and, their, attributes, changed, over, time, and, with, cultural, influences, from, other, mesoamerican, groups, the, gods, are, at, once, three, creator, preserver, and, destroyer, and, at, the, same, time, just, one, an, important, characteristic, of, mesoamerican, religion, was, the, dualism, among, the, divine, entities, the, gods, represented, the, confrontation, between, opposite, poles, the, positive, exemplified, by, light, the, masculine, force, war, the, sun, etc, and, the, negative, exemplified, by, darkness, the, feminine, repose, peace, the, moon, etc, the, typical, mesoamerican, cosmology, sees, the, world, as, separated, into, a, day, world, watched, by, the, sun, and, a, night, world, watched, by, the, moon, more, importantly, the, three, superposed, levels, of, the, world, are, united, by, a, ceiba, tree, yaxche, in, mayan, the, geographic, vision, is, also, tied, to, the, cardinal, points, certain, geographical, features, are, linked, to, different, parts, of, this, cosmovision, thus, mountains, and, tall, trees, connect, the, middle, and, upper, worlds, caves, connect, the, middle, and, nether, worlds, generally, sacrifice, can, be, divided, into, two, types, autosacrifice, and, human, sacrifice, the, different, forms, of, sacrifice, are, reflected, in, the, imagery, used, to, evoke, ideological, structure, and, sociocultural, organization, in, mesoamerica, in, the, maya, area, for, example, steles, depict, bloodletting, rituals, performed, by, ruling, elites, eagles, and, jaguars, devouring, human, hearts, jade, circles, or, necklaces, that, represented, hearts, and, plants, and, flowers, that, symbolized, both, nature, and, the, blood, that, provided, life, imagery, also, showed, pleas, for, rain, or, pleas, for, blood, with, the, same, intention, to, replenish, the, divine, energy, ritual, sacrifice, was, done, in, efforts, to, appease, the, gods, and, was, done, with, the, purpose, of, protection, of, the, population, autosacrifice, also, called, bloodletting, is, the, ritualized, practice, of, drawing, blood, from, oneself, it, is, commonly, seen, or, represented, through, iconography, as, performed, by, ruling, elites, in, highly, ritualized, ceremonies, but, it, was, easily, practiced, in, mundane, sociocultural, contexts, i, e, non, elites, could, perform, autosacrifice, the, act, was, typically, performed, with, obsidian, prismatic, blades, or, stingray, spines, and, blood, was, drawn, from, piercing, or, cutting, the, tongue, earlobes, and, or, genitals, among, other, locations, another, form, of, autosacrifice, was, conducted, by, pulling, a, rope, with, attached, thorns, through, the, tongue, or, earlobes, the, blood, produced, was, then, collected, on, amate, held, in, a, bowl, autosacrifice, was, not, limited, to, male, rulers, as, their, female, counterparts, often, performed, these, ritualized, activities, they, are, typically, shown, performing, the, rope, and, thorns, technique, a, recently, discovered, queen, s, tomb, in, the, classic, maya, site, of, waka, also, known, as, el, per, had, a, ceremonial, stingray, spine, placed, in, her, genital, area, suggesting, that, women, also, performed, bloodletting, in, their, genitalia, sacrifice, had, great, importance, in, the, social, and, religious, aspects, of, mesoamerican, culture, first, it, showed, death, transformed, into, the, divine, death, is, the, consequence, of, a, human, sacrifice, but, it, is, not, the, end, it, is, but, the, continuation, of, the, cosmic, cycle, death, creates, life, divine, energy, is, liberated, through, death, and, returns, to, the, gods, who, are, then, able, to, create, more, life, secondly, it, justifies, war, since, the, most, valuable, sacrifices, are, obtained, through, conflict, the, death, of, the, warrior, is, the, greatest, sacrifice, and, gives, the, gods, the, energy, to, go, about, their, daily, activities, such, as, the, bringing, of, rain, warfare, and, capturing, prisoners, became, a, method, of, social, advancement, and, a, religious, cause, finally, it, justifies, the, control, of, power, by, the, two, ruling, classes, the, priests, and, the, warriors, the, priests, controlled, the, religious, ideology, and, the, warriors, supplied, the, sacrifices, historically, it, was, also, believed, those, sacrificed, were, chosen, by, the, gods, this, idea, of, being, chosen, was, decided, by, the, gods, this, was, then, displayed, by, acts, such, as, being, struck, by, lightning, if, someone, was, struck, by, lightning, and, a, sacrifice, was, needed, they, would, often, be, chosen, by, their, population, as, they, believed, they, were, chosen, by, the, gods, the, mesoamerican, ballgame, was, a, sport, with, ritual, associations, played, for, over, 3000, years, by, nearly, all, pre, columbian, peoples, of, mesoamerica, the, sport, had, different, versions, in, different, places, during, the, millennia, and, a, modern, version, of, the, game, ulama, is, still, played, in, a, few, places, over, 1300, ballcourts, have, been, found, throughout, mesoamerica, they, vary, considerably, in, size, but, they, all, feature, long, narrow, alleys, with, side, walls, to, bounce, the, balls, against, the, rules, of, the, ballgame, are, not, known, but, it, was, probably, similar, to, volleyball, where, the, object, is, to, keep, the, ball, in, play, in, the, most, well, known, version, of, the, game, the, players, struck, the, ball, with, their, hips, though, some, versions, used, forearms, or, employed, rackets, bats, or, handstones, the, ball, was, made, of, solid, rubber, and, weighed, up, to, 4, kg, or, more, with, sizes, that, differed, greatly, over, time, or, according, to, the, version, played, while, the, game, was, played, casually, for, simple, recreation, including, by, children, and, perhaps, even, women, the, game, also, had, important, ritual, aspects, and, major, formal, ballgames, were, held, as, ritual, events, often, featuring, human, sacrifice, mesoamerican, astronomy, included, a, broad, understanding, of, the, cycles, of, planets, and, other, celestial, bodies, special, importance, was, given, to, the, sun, moon, and, venus, as, the, morning, and, evening, star, observatories, were, built, at, some, sites, including, the, round, observatory, at, ceibal, and, the, observatorio, at, xochicalco, often, the, architectural, organization, of, mesoamerican, sites, was, based, on, precise, calculations, derived, from, astronomical, observations, well, known, examples, of, these, include, the, el, castillo, pyramid, at, chichen, itza, and, the, observatorio, at, xochicalco, a, unique, and, common, architectural, complex, found, among, many, mesoamerican, sites, is, the, e, group, these, are, aligned, to, serve, as, astronomical, observatories, the, name, of, this, complex, is, based, on, uaxactun, s, group, e, the, first, known, observatory, in, the, maya, area, perhaps, the, earliest, observatory, documented, in, mesoamerica, is, that, of, the, monte, alto, culture, this, complex, consisted, of, three, plain, stelae, and, a, temple, oriented, with, respect, to, the, pleiades, it, has, been, argued, that, among, mesoamerican, societies, the, concepts, of, space, and, time, are, associated, with, the, four, cardinal, compass, points, and, linked, together, by, the, calendar, dates, or, events, were, always, tied, to, a, compass, direction, and, the, calendar, specified, the, symbolic, geographical, characteristic, peculiar, to, that, period, resulting, from, the, significance, held, by, the, cardinal, directions, many, mesoamerican, architectural, features, if, not, entire, settlements, were, planned, and, oriented, according, to, directionality, in, maya, cosmology, each, cardinal, point, was, assigned, a, specific, color, and, a, specific, jaguar, deity, bacab, they, are, as, follows, later, cultures, such, as, the, kaqchikel, and, k, iche, maintain, the, association, of, cardinal, directions, with, each, color, but, use, different, names, among, the, aztecs, the, name, of, each, day, was, associated, with, a, cardinal, point, thus, conferring, symbolic, significance, and, each, cardinal, direction, was, associated, with, a, group, of, symbols, below, are, the, symbols, and, concepts, associated, with, each, direction, mesoamerican, artistic, expression, was, conditioned, by, ideology, and, generally, focused, on, themes, of, religion, and, or, sociopolitical, power, this, is, largely, based, on, the, fact, that, most, works, that, survived, the, spanish, conquest, were, public, monuments, these, monuments, were, typically, erected, by, rulers, who, sought, to, visually, legitimize, their, sociocultural, and, political, position, by, doing, so, they, intertwined, their, lineage, personal, attributes, and, achievements, and, legacy, with, religious, concepts, as, such, these, monuments, were, specifically, designed, for, public, display, and, took, many, forms, including, stele, sculpture, architectural, reliefs, and, other, types, of, architectural, elements, e, g, roofcombs, other, themes, expressed, include, tracking, time, glorifying, the, city, and, veneration, of, the, gods, all, of, which, were, tied, to, explicitly, aggrandizing, the, abilities, and, the, reign, of, the, ruler, who, commissioned, the, artwork, the, majority, of, artwork, created, during, this, historical, time, was, about, these, topics, religion, and, politics, rulers, were, drawn, and, sculpted, historical, tales, and, events, were, then, translated, into, pieces, of, art, and, art, was, used, to, relay, religious, and, political, messages, archaeological, studies, have, never, discovered, any, written, music, from, the, pre, columbian, era, but, musical, instruments, were, found, as, well, as, carvings, and, depictions, that, clearly, show, how, music, played, a, central, role, in, the, mayan, religious, and, societal, structures, for, example, as, accompaniment, to, celebrations, and, funerals, some, mesoamerican, civilizations, such, as, the, maya, commonly, played, various, instruments, such, as, drums, flutes, and, whistles, although, most, of, the, original, mayan, music, disappeared, following, the, spanish, colonization, some, of, it, mixed, with, the, incoming, spanish, music, and, exists, to, date
