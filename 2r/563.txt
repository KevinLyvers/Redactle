of, the, state, peter, abolished, the, patriarchate, and, replaced, it, with, a, collective, body, the, most, holy, synod, which, was, led, by, a, government, official, peter, died, in, 1725, leaving, an, unsettled, succession, after, a, short, reign, by, his, widow, catherine, i, the, crown, passed, to, empress, anna, she, slowed, the, reforms, and, led, a, successful, war, against, the, ottoman, empire, this, resulted, in, a, significant, weakening, of, the, crimean, khanate, an, ottoman, vassal, and, long, term, russian, adversary, the, discontent, over, the, dominant, positions, of, baltic, germans, in, russian, politics, resulted, in, peter, i, s, daughter, elizabeth, being, put, on, the, russian, throne, elizabeth, supported, the, arts, architecture, and, the, sciences, for, example, the, founding, of, moscow, university, but, she, did, not, carry, out, significant, structural, reforms, her, reign, which, lasted, nearly, 20, years, is, also, known, for, russia, s, involvement, in, the, seven, years, war, where, it, was, successful, militarily, but, gained, little, politically, catherine, the, great, was, a, german, princess, who, married, peter, iii, the, german, heir, to, the, russian, crown, after, the, death, of, empress, elizabeth, catherine, came, to, power, after, she, effected, a, coup, d, tat, against, her, very, unpopular, husband, she, contributed, to, the, resurgence, of, the, russian, nobility, that, began, after, the, death, of, peter, the, great, abolishing, state, service, and, granting, them, control, of, most, state, functions, in, the, provinces, she, also, removed, the, beard, tax, instituted, by, peter, the, great, catherine, extended, russian, political, control, over, the, lands, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, supporting, the, targowica, confederation, however, the, cost, of, these, campaigns, further, burdened, the, already, oppressive, social, system, under, which, serfs, were, required, to, spend, almost, all, of, their, time, laboring, on, their, owners, land, a, major, peasant, uprising, took, place, in, 1773, after, catherine, legalised, the, selling, of, serfs, separate, from, land, inspired, by, a, cossack, named, yemelyan, pugachev, and, proclaiming, hang, all, the, landlords, the, rebels, threatened, to, take, moscow, before, they, were, ruthlessly, suppressed, instead, of, imposing, the, traditional, punishment, of, drawing, and, quartering, catherine, issued, secret, instructions, that, the, executioners, should, execute, death, sentences, quickly, and, with, minimal, suffering, as, part, of, her, effort, to, introduce, compassion, into, the, law, during, the, reign, of, catherine, there, was, a, russo, turkish, war, 1768, 1774, in, result, of, which, russian, empire, conquered, the, vast, lands, in, the, south, including, the, black, and, azov, seas, coasts, the, fortress, of, st, elizabeth, played, key, role, in, this, victory, after, the, liquidation, of, the, zaporozhian, sich, in, 1775, on, the, former, lands, of, the, ukrainian, cossacks, were, created, the, novorossiya, governorate, and, on, the, sites, of, cossack, settlements, were, founded, the, cities, of, katerynoslav,

furthered, these, efforts, by, ordering, the, public, trial, of, darya, nikolayevna, saltykova, a, high, ranking, noblewoman, on, charges, of, torturing, and, murdering, serfs, whilst, these, gestures, garnered, catherine, much, positive, attention, from, europe, during, the, enlightenment, the, specter, of, revolution, and, disorder, continued, to, haunt, her, and, her, successors, indeed, her, son, paul, introduced, a, number, of, increasingly, erratic, decrees, in, his, short, reign, aimed, directly, against, the, spread, of, french, culture, in, response, to, their, revolution, in, order, to, ensure, the, continued, support, of, the, nobility, which, was, essential, to, her, reign, catherine, was, obliged, to, strengthen, their, authority, and, power, at, the, expense, of, the, serfs, and, other, lower, classes, nevertheless, catherine, realized, that, serfdom, must, eventually, be, ended, going, so, far, in, her, nakaz, instruction, to, say, that, serfs, were, just, as, good, as, we, are, a, comment, received, with, disgust, by, the, nobility, catherine, advanced, russia, s, southern, and, western, frontiers, successfully, waging, war, against, the, ottoman, empire, for, territory, near, the, black, sea, and, incorporating, territories, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, during, the, partitions, of, poland, alongside, austria, and,

in, 1796, after, they, had, invaded, eastern, georgia, upon, achieving, victory, she, established, russian, rule, over, it, and, expelled, the, newly, established, persian, garrisons, in, the, caucasus, catherine, s, expansionist, policy, caused, russia, to, develop, into, a, major, european, power, as, did, the, enlightenment, era, and, the, golden, age, in, russia, but, after, catherine, died, in, 1796, she, was, succeeded, by, her, son, paul, he, brought, russia, into, a, major, coalition, war, against, the, new, revolutionary, french, republic, in, 1798, russian, commander, field,

game, between, russia, and, the, british, empire, however, his, reign, was, marked, by, criticism, for, the, government, s, suppression, of, political, dissent, and, perceived, failures, or, inaction, during, events, like, the, khodynka, tragedy, anti, jewish, pogroms, bloody, sunday, 1905, and, the, violent, suppression, of, the, 1905, russian, revolution, the, russo, japanese, war, which,

of, this, revolt, lay, in, the, napoleonic, wars, when, a, number, of, well, educated, russian, officers, travelled, in, europe, in, the, course, of, military, campaigns, where, their, exposure, to, the, liberalism, of, western, europe, encouraged, them, to, seek, change, on, their, return, to, autocratic, russia, the, result, was, the, decembrist, revolt, december, 1825, which, was, the, work, of, a, small, circle, of, liberal, nobles, and, army, officers, who, wanted, to, install, nicholas, brother, constantine, as, a, constitutional, monarch, the, revolt, was, easily, crushed, but, it, caused, nicholas, to, turn, away, from, the, modernization, program, begun, by, peter, the, great, and, champion, the, doctrine, of, orthodoxy, autocracy, and, nationality, in, order, to, repress,

suffered, on, land, and, sea, exposed, the, weakness, of, emperor, nicholas, i, s, regime, when, emperor, alexander, ii, ascended, the, throne, in, 1855, the, desire, for, reform, was, widespread, a, growing, humanitarian, movement, attacked, serfdom, as, inefficient, in, 1859, there, were, more, than, 23, million, serfs, in, usually, poor, living, conditions, alexander, ii, decided, to, abolish, serfdom, from, above, with, ample, provision, for, the, landowners, rather, than, wait, for, it, to, be, abolished, from, below, by, revolution, the, emancipation, reform, of, 1861, which, freed, the, serfs, was, the, single, most, important, event, in, 19th, century, russian, history, and, the, beginning, of, the, end, of, the, landed, aristocracy, s, monopoly, on, power, the, 1860s, saw, further,

stimulating, industry, and, the, middle, class, grew, in, number, and, influence, however, instead, of, receiving, their, lands, as, a, gift, the, freed, peasants, had, to, pay, a, special, lifetime, tax, to, the, government, which, in, turn, paid, the, landlords, a, generous, price, for, the, land, that, they, had, lost, in, numerous, cases, the, peasants, ended, up, with, relatively, small, amounts, of, the, least, productive, land, all, the, property, turned, over, to, the, peasants, was, owned, collectively, by, the, mir, the, village, community, which, divided, the, land, among, the, peasants, and, supervised, the, various, holdings, although, serfdom, was, abolished, since, its, abolition, was, achieved, on, terms, unfavourable, to, the, peasants, revolutionary, tensions, did, not, abate, revolutionaries, believed, that, the, newly, freed, serfs, were, merely, being, sold, into, wage, slavery, in, the, onset, of, the, industrial, revolution, and, that, the, urban,

similarly, suppressed, its, muslims, in, central, asia, and, caucasia, russian, nationalist, opinion, became, a, major, domestic, factor, with, its, support, for, liberating, balkan, christians, from,

montenegro, gain, independence, from, and, strengthen, themselves, against, the, ottomans, another, significant, result, of, the, 1877, 1878, russo, turkish, war, in, russia, s, favour, was, the, acquisition, from, the, ottomans, of, the, provinces, of, batum, ardahan, and, kars, in, transcaucasia, which, were, transformed, into, the, militarily, administered, regions, of, batum, oblast, and,

became, alarmed, when, russia, threatened, afghanistan, with, the, implicit, threat, to, india, and, decades, of, diplomatic, maneuvering, resulted, called, the, great, game, that, rivalry, between, the, two, empires, has, been, considered, to, have, included, far, flung, territories, such, as, outer, mongolia, and, tibet, the, maneuvering, largely, ended, with, the, anglo, russian, convention, of, 1907, expansion, into, the, vast, stretches, of, siberia, was, slow, and, expensive, but, finally, became, possible, with, the, building, of, the, trans, siberian, railway, 1890, to, 1904, this,

to, germany, and, austria, hungary, the, three, would, later, comprise, the, triple, entente, alliance, in, the, first, world, war, in, 1894, alexander, iii, was, succeeded, by, his, son, nicholas, ii, who, was, committed, to, retaining, the, autocracy, that, his, father, had, left, him, nicholas, ii, proved, as, an, ineffective, ruler, and, in, the, end, his, dynasty, was, overthrown, by, the, russian, revolution, the, industrial, revolution, began, to, show, significant, influence, in, russia, but, the, country, remained, rural, and, poor, economic, conditions, steadily, improved, after,

without, payment, but, debated, whether, to, distribute, the, land, among, the, peasants, the, narodnik, solution, or, to, put, it, into, collective, local, ownership, the, socialist, revolutionaries, also, differed, from, the, social, democrats, in, that, the, srs, believed, a, revolution, must, rely, on, urban, workers, not, the, peasantry, in, 1903, at, the, 2nd, congress, of, the, russian, social, democratic, labour, party, in, london, the, party, split, into, two, wings, the, gradualist, mensheviks, and, the, more, radical, bolsheviks, the, mensheviks, believed, that, the, russian, working, class, was, insufficiently, developed, and, that, socialism, could, be, achieved, only, after, a, period, of, bourgeois, democratic, rule, they, thus, tended, to, ally, themselves, with, the, forces, of, bourgeois, liberalism, the, bolsheviks, under, vladimir, lenin, supported, the, idea, of, forming, a, small, elite, of, professional, revolutionists, subject, to, strong, party, discipline, to, act, as, the, vanguard, of, the, proletariat, in, order, to, seize, power, by, force, defeat, in, the, russo, japanese, war, 1904, 1905, was, a, major, blow, to, the, tsarist, regime,

were, so, furious, over, the, massacre, that, a, general, strike, was, declared, which, demanded, a, democratic, republic, this, marked, the, beginning, of, the, revolution, of, 1905, soviets, councils, of, workers, appeared, in, most, cities, to, direct, revolutionary, activity, russia, was, paralyzed, and, the, government, was, desperate, in, october, 1905, nicholas, reluctantly, issued, the, october, manifesto, which, conceded, the, creation, of, a, national, duma, legislature, to, be, called, without, delay, the, right, to, vote, was, extended, and, no, law, was, to, become, final, without, confirmation, by, the, duma, the, moderate, groups, were, satisfied, but, the, socialists, rejected, the, concessions, as, insufficient, and, tried, to, organise, new, strikes, by, the, end, of, 1905, there, was, disunity, among, the, reformers, and, the, emperor, s, position, was, strengthened, allowing, him, to, roll, back, some, of, the, concessions, with, the, new, russian,

joined, to, oppose, the, new, rising, power, of, germany, russia, and, france, s, relations, remained, isolated, before, the, 1890s, when, both, sides, agreed, to, ally, when, peace, was, threatened,

germanophobic, sentiment, including, the, name, of, the, capital, saint, petersburg, which, sounded, too, german, for, the, sake, of, words, sankt, and, burg, and, was, thus, renamed, to, the, russianised, petrograd, the, russian, entry, into, the, first, world, war, was, followed, by, france, which, both, had, been, allied, with, russia, since, 1892, fearing, the, rise, of, germany, as, the, new, power, the, german, general, staff, had, therefore, devised, the, schlieffen, plan, which, first, eliminated, france, via, nonaligned, belgium, before, moving, east, to, attack, russia,

ended, up, ruling, finland, as, a, semi, constitutional, monarch, through, the, governor, general, of, finland, and, a, native, senate, appointed, by, him, the, emperor, never, explicitly, recognized, finland, as, a, constitutional, state, in, its, own, right, although, his, finnish, subjects, came, to, consider, the, grand, duchy, as, such, in, the, aftermath, of, the, russo, turkish, war, 1806, 1812, and, the, ensuing, treaty, of, bucharest, 1812, the, eastern, parts, of, the, principality, of, moldavia, an, ottoman, vassal, state, along, with, some, areas, formerly, under, direct, ottoman,

gained, sovereignty, over, congress, poland, which, on, paper, was, an, autonomous, kingdom, in, personal, union, with, russia, however, this, autonomy, was, eroded, after, the, november, uprising, in, 1831, and, was, finally, abolished, in, 1867, saint, petersburg, gradually, extended, and, consolidated, its, control, over, the, caucasus, in, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, at, the,

the, caucasian, war, 1817, 1864, the, russian, empire, expanded, its, influence, and, possessions, in, central, asia, especially, in, the, later, 19th, century, conquering, much, of, russian, turkestan, in, 1865, and, continuing, to, add, territory, as, late, as, 1885, newly, discovered, arctic, islands, became, part, of, the, russian, empire, the, new, siberian, islands, from, the, early, 18th, century, severnaya, zemlya, emperor, nicholas, ii, land, first, mapped, and, claimed, as, late, as, 1913, during, world, war, i, russia, briefly, occupied, a, small, part, of, east, prussia, then, a, part, of, germany, a, significant, portion, of, austrian, galicia, and, significant, portions, of, ottoman, armenia, while, the, modern, russian, federation, currently, controls, the, kaliningrad, oblast, which, comprised, the, northern, part, of, east, prussia, this, differs, from, the, area, captured, by, the, empire, in, 1914, though, there, was, some, overlap, gusev, gumbinnen, in, german, was, the, site, of, the, initial, russian, victory, according, to, the, 1st, article, of, the, organic, law, the, russian, empire, was, one, indivisible, state, in, addition, the, 26th, article, stated, that, with, the, imperial, russian, throne, are, indivisible, the, kingdom, of, poland, and, grand, principality, of, finland, relations, with, the, grand, principality, of, finland, were, also, regulated, by, the, 2nd, article, the, grand, principality, of, finland, constituted, an, indivisible, part, of, the, russian, state, in, its, internal, affairs, governed, by, special, regulations, at, the, base, of, special, laws, and, by, the, law, of, 10, june, 1910, between, 1744, and, 1867, the, empire, also, controlled, russian, america, with, the, exception, of, this, territory, modern, day, alaska, the, russian, empire, was, a, contiguous, mass, of, land, spanning, europe, and, asia, in, this, it, differed, from, contemporary, colonial, style, empires, the, result, of, this, was, that, while, the, british, and, french, empires, declined, in, the, 20th, century, a, large, portion, of, the, russian, empire, s, territory, remained, together, first, within, the, soviet, union, and, after, 1991, in, the, smaller, russian, federation, furthermore, the, empire, at, times, controlled, concession, territories, notably, the, kwantung, leased, territory, and, the, chinese, eastern, railway, both, conceded, by, qing, china, as, well, as, the, russian, concession, of, tianjin, in, 1815, georg, anton, sch, ffer, a, russian, entrepreneur, went, to, kauai, and, negotiated, a, treaty, of, protection, with, the, island, s, governor, kaumualii, vassal, of, king, kamehameha, i, of, hawaii, but, the, russian, emperor, refused, to, ratify, the, treaty, see, also, orthodox, church, in, hawaii, and, russian, fort, elizabeth, in, 1889, a, russian, adventurer, nikolay, ivanovitch, achinov, tried, to, establish, a, russian, colony, in, africa, sagallo, situated, on, the, gulf, of, tadjoura, in, present, day, djibouti, however, this, attempt, angered, the, french, who, dispatched, two, gunboats, against, the, colony, after, a, brief, resistance, the, colony, surrendered, and, the, russian, settlers, were, deported, to, odessa, from, its, initial, creation, until, the, 1905, revolution, the, russian, empire, was, led, by, the, emperor, also, referred, to, as, tsar, who, ruled, as, an, absolute, monarch, after, the, revolution, of, 1905, russia, developed, a, new, type, of, government, which, became, difficult, to, categorize, in, the, almanach, de, gotha, for, 1910, russia, was, described, as, a, constitutional, monarchy, under, an, autocratic, tsar, this, contradiction, in, terms, demonstrated, the, difficulty, of, precisely, defining, the, system, transitional, and, sui, generis, established, in, the, russian, empire, after, october, 1905, before, this, date, the, fundamental, laws, of, russia, described, the, power, of, the, emperor, as, autocratic, and, unlimited, after, october, 1905, while, the, imperial, style, was, still, emperor, and, autocrat, of, all, the, russias, the, fundamental, laws, were, changed, by, removing, the, word, unlimited, while, the, emperor, retained, many, of, his, old, prerogatives, including, an, absolute, veto, over, all, legislation, he, equally, agreed, to, the, establishment, of, an, elected, parliament, without, whose, consent, no, laws, were, to, be, enacted, in, russia, not, that, the, regime, in, russia, had, become, in, any, true, sense, constitutional, far, less, parliamentary, but, the, unlimited, autocracy, had, given, way, to, a, self, limited, autocracy, whether, this, autocracy, was, to, be, permanently, limited, by, the, new, changes, or, only, at, the, continuing, discretion, of, the, autocrat, became, a, subject, of, heated, controversy, between, conflicting, parties, in, the, state, provisionally, then, the, russian, governmental, system, may, perhaps, be, best, defined, as, a, limited, monarchy, under, an, autocratic, emperor, conservatism, was, the, ideology, of, most, of, the, russian, leadership, albeit, with, some, reformist, activities, from, time, to, time, the, structure, of, conservative, thought, was, based, upon, anti, rationalism, of, the, intellectuals, religiosity, rooted, in, the, russian, orthodox, church, traditionalism, rooted, in, the, landed, estates, worked, by, serfs, and, militarism, rooted, in, the, army, officer, corps, regarding, irrationality, russia, avoided, the, full, force, of, the, european, enlightenment, which, gave, priority, to, rationalism, preferring, the, romanticism, of, an, idealized, nation, state, that, reflected, the, beliefs, values, and, behavior, of, the, distinctive, people, the, distinctly, liberal, notion, of, progress, was, replaced, by, a, conservative, notion, of, modernization, based, on, the, incorporation, of, modern, technology, to, serve, the, established, system, the, promise, of, modernization, in, the, service, of, autocracy, frightened, the, socialist, intellectual, alexander, herzen, who, warned, of, a, russia, governed, by, genghis, khan, with, a, telegraph, peter, the, great, changed, his, title, from, tsar, to, emperor, in, order, to, secure, russia, s, position, in, the, european, states, system, while, later, rulers, did, not, discard, the, new, title, the, russian, monarch, was, commonly, known, as, the, tsar, or, tsaritsa, until, the, imperial, system, was, abolished, during, the, february, revolution, of, 1917, prior, to, the, issuance, of, the, october, manifesto, the, emperor, ruled, as, an, absolute, monarch, subject, to, only, two, limitations, on, his, authority, both, of, which, were, intended, to, protect, the, existing, system, the, emperor, and, his, consort, must, both, belong, to, the, russian, orthodox, church, and, he, must, obey, the, pauline, laws, of, succession, established, by, paul, i, beyond, this, the, power, of, the, russian, autocrat, was, virtually, limitless, on, 17, october, 1905, the, situation, changed, the, ruler, voluntarily, limited, his, legislative, power, by, decreeing, that, no, measure, was, to, become, law, without, the, consent, of, the, imperial, duma, a, freely, elected, national, assembly, established, by, the, organic, law, issued, on, 28, april, 1906, however, he, retained, the, right, to, disband, the, newly, established, duma, and, he, exercised, this, right, more, than, once, he, also, retained, an, absolute, veto, over, all, legislation, and, only, he, could, initiate, any, changes, to, the, organic, law, itself, his, ministers, were, responsible, solely, to, him, and, not, to, the, duma, or, any, other, authority, which, could, question, but, not, remove, them, thus, while, the, emperor, s, personal, powers, were, limited, in, scope, after, 28, april, 1906, they, remained, formidable, under, russia, s, revised, fundamental, law, of, 20, february, 1906, the, state, council, was, associated, with, the, duma, as, a, legislative, upper, house, from, this, time, the, legislative, power, was, exercised, normally, by, the, emperor, only, in, concert, with, the, two, chambers, the, council, of, the, empire, or, imperial, council, as, reconstituted, for, this, purpose, consisted, of, 196, members, of, whom, 98, were, nominated, by, the, emperor, while, 98, were, elective, the, ministers, also, nominated, were, ex, officio, members, of, the, elected, members, 3, were, returned, by, the, black, clergy, the, monks, 3, by, the, white, clergy, secular, 18, by, the, corporations, of, nobles, 6, by, the, academy, of, sciences, and, the, universities, 6, by, the, chambers, of, commerce, 6, by, the, industrial, councils, 34, by, local, governmental, zemstvos, 16, by, local, governments, having, no, zemstvos, and, 6, by, poland, as, a, legislative, body, the, powers, of, the, council, were, coordinate, with, those, of, the, duma, in, practice, however, it, has, seldom, if, ever, initiated, legislation, the, duma, of, the, empire, or, imperial, duma, gosudarstvennaya, duma, which, formed, the, lower, house, of, the, russian, parliament, consisted, since, the, ukaz, of, 2, june, 1907, of, 442, members, elected, by, an, exceedingly, complicated, process, the, membership, was, manipulated, as, to, secure, an, overwhelming, majority, of, the, wealthy, especially, the, landed, classes, and, also, for, the, representatives, of, the, russian, peoples, at, the, expense, of, the, subject, nations, each, province, of, the, empire, except, central, asia, returned, a, certain, number, of, members, added, to, which, were, those, returned, by, several, large, cities, the, members, of, the, duma, were, chosen, by, electoral, colleges, and, these, in, their, turn, were, elected, by, assemblies, of, the, three, classes, landed, proprietors, citizens, and, peasants, in, these, assemblies, the, wealthiest, proprietors, sat, in, person, while, the, lesser, proprietors, were, represented, by, delegates, the, urban, population, was, divided, into, two, categories, according, to, taxable, wealth, and, elected, delegates, directly, to, the, college, of, the, governorates, the, peasants, were, represented, by, delegates, selected, by, the, regional, subdivisions, called, volosts, workmen, were, treated, in, a, special, manner, with, every, industrial, concern, employing, fifty, hands, electing, one, or, more, delegates, to, the, electoral, college, in, the, college, itself, the, voting, for, the, duma, was, by, secret, ballot, and, a, simple, majority, carried, the, day, since, the, majority, consisted, of, conservative, elements, the, landowners, and, urban, delegates, the, progressives, had, little, chance, of, representation, at, all, save, for, the, curious, provision, that, one, member, at, least, in, each, government, was, to, be, chosen, from, each, of, the, five, classes, represented, in, the, college, that, the, duma, had, any, radical, elements, was, mainly, due, to, the, peculiar, franchise, enjoyed, by, the, seven, largest, towns, saint, petersburg, moscow, kiev, odessa, riga, and, the, polish, cities, of, warsaw, and, d, these, elected, their, delegates, to, the, duma, directly, and, though, their, votes, were, divided, on, the, basis, of, taxable, property, in, such, a, way, as, to, give, the, advantage, to, wealth, each, returned, the, same, number, of, delegates, in, 1905, a, council, of, ministers, sovyet, ministrov, was, created, under, a, minister, president, the, first, appearance, of, a, prime, minister, in, russia, this, council, consisted, of, all, the, ministers, and, of, the, heads, of, other, principal, departments, the, ministries, were, as, follows,

emperor, and, consisted, of, the, three, metropolitans, of, moscow, saint, petersburg, and, kiev, the, archbishop, of, georgia, and, a, number, of, bishops, sitting, in, rotation, the, senate, pravitelstvuyushchi, senat, i, e, directing, or, governing, senate, originally, established, during, the, government, reform, of, peter, the, great, consisted, of, members, nominated, by, the, emperor, its, wide, variety, of, functions, were, carried, out, by, the, different, departments, into, which, it, was, divided, it, was, the, supreme, court, of, cassation, an, audit, office, a, high, court, of, justice, for, all, political, offences, and, one, of, its, departments, fulfilled, the, functions, of, a, heralds, college, it, also, had, supreme, jurisdiction, in, all, disputes, arising, out, of, the, administration, of, the, empire, notably, in, differences, between, representatives, of, the, central, power, and, the, elected, organs, of, local, self, government, lastly, it, promulgated, new, laws, a, function, which, theoretically, gave, it, a, power, akin, to, that, of, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, states, of, rejecting, measures, not, in, accordance, with, fundamental, laws, as, of, 1914, russia, was, divided, into, 81, governorates, guberniyas, 20, oblasts, and, 1, okrug, vassals, and, protectorates, of, the, russian, empire, included, the, emirate,

systems, of, their, own, independent, of, the, governorates, in, these, the, chief, of, police, acted, as, governor, the, judicial, system, of, the, russian, empire, was, established, by, the, statute, of, 20, november, 1864, of, alexander, ii, this, system, based, partly, on, english, and, french, law, was, predicated, on, the, separation, of, judicial, and, administrative, functions, the, independence, of, the, judges, and, courts, public, trials, and, oral, procedure, and, the, equality, of, all, classes, before, the, law, moreover, a, democratic, element, was, introduced, by, the, adoption, of, the, jury, system, and, the, election, of, judges, this, system, was, disliked, by, the, bureaucracy, due, to, its, putting, the, administration, of, justice, outside, of, the,

fixed, rent, which, could, be, fulfilled, by, personal, labour, the, allotments, could, be, redeemed, by, peasants, with, the, help, of, the, crown, and, then, they, were, freed, from, all,

to, curtail, the, allotments, that, the, peasants, had, occupied, under, serfdom, and, frequently, deprived, them, of, precisely, that, land, of, which, they, were, most, in, need, pasture, lands, around, their, houses, the, result, was, to, compel, the, peasants, to, rent, land, from, their, former, masters, serfs, lived, in, deplorable, conditions, working, in, the, fields, for, nearly, seven, days, a, week, and, being, exiled, to, the, harsh, land, of, siberia, or, sent, to, military, service, owners, had, the, right, to, sell, slaves, depending, on, whether, they, were, targeting,

emperor, alexander, ii, saw, serfs, as, a, problem, that, held, back, russia, s, development, so, he, liberated, 23, million, serfs, to, become, free, but, they, remained, indigent, throughout, the, former, enslaved, population, despite, their, rights, the, zemstvo, system, was, introduced, in, 1865, as, a, rural, assembly, with, administrative, authority, over, the, local, population, including, education, and, welfare, which, ex, serfs, were, unable, to, acquire, the, former, serfs, became, peasants, joining, the, millions, of, farmers, who, already, had, peasant, status, most, peasants, lived, in, tens, of, thousands, of, small, villages, under, a, highly, patriarchal, system, hundreds, of, thousands, moved, to, cities, to, work, in, factories, but, they, typically, retained, their, village, connections, after, emancipation, reform, one, quarter, of, peasants, received, allotments, of, only, 1, 2, hectares, 2, 9, acres, per, male, and, one, half, received, less, than, 3, 4, to, 4, 6, hectares, 8, 5, to, 11, 4, acres, the, normal, size, of, the, allotment, necessary, for, the, subsistence, of, a, family, under, the, three, fields, system, is, estimated, at, 11, to, 17, hectares, 28, to, 42, acres, this, land, was, of, necessity, rented, from, the, landlords, the, aggregate, value, of, the, redemption, and, land, taxes, often, reached, 185, to, 275, of, the, normal, rental, value, of, the, allotments, not, to, speak, of, taxes, for, recruiting, purposes, the, church, roads, local, administration, and, so, on, chiefly, levied, on, the, peasants, this, burden, increased, every, year, consequently, one, fifth, of, the, inhabitants, left, their, houses, and, cattle, disappeared, every, year, more, than, half, the, adult, males, in, some, districts, three, quarters, of, the, men, and, one, third, of, the, women, quit, their, homes, and, wandered, throughout, russia, in, search, of, work, in, the, governments, of, the, black, earth, area, the, state, of, matters, was, hardly, better, many, peasants, took, gratuitous, allotments, whose, amount, was, about, one, eighth, of, the, normal, allotments, the, average, allotment, in, kherson, was, only, 0, 36, hectares, 0, 90, acres, and, for, allotments, from, 1, 2, to, 2, 3, hectares, 2, 9, to, 5, 8, acres, the, peasants, paid, 5, to, 10, rubles, in, redemption, tax, the, state, peasants, were, better, off, but, they, too, were, emigrating, in, masses, it, was, only, in, the, steppe, that, the, situation, was, more, hopeful, in, ukraine, where, the, allotments, were, personal, the, mir, existing, only, among, state, peasants, the, state, of, affairs, was, not, better, on, account, of, high, redemption, taxes, in, the, western, provinces, where, the, land, was, more, cheaply, valued, and, the, allotments, somewhat, increased, after, the, polish, insurrection, the, situation, was, better, finally, in, the, baltic, provinces, nearly, all, the, land, belonged, to, the, german, landlords, who, either, farmed, the, land, themselves, with, hired, laborers, or, let, it, in, small, farms, only, one, quarter, of, the, peasants, were, farmers, the, remainder, were, mere, laborers, the, situation, of, the, former, serf, proprietors, was, also, unsatisfactory, accustomed, to, the, use, of, compulsory, labor, they, failed, to, adapt, to, the, new, conditions, the, millions, of, rubles, of, redemption, money, received, from, the, crown, was, spent, without, any, real, or, lasting, agricultural, improvements, having, been, effected, the, forests, were, sold, and, the, only, prosperous, landlords, were, those, who, exacted, rack, rents, for, the, land, allotted, to, peasants, there, was, an, increase, of, wealth, among, the, few, but, along, with, this, a, general, impoverishment, of, the, mass, of, the, people, added, to, this, the, peculiar, institution, of, the, mir, framed, on, the, principle, of, community, ownership, and, occupation, of, the, land, the, overall, effect, was, not, encouraging, of, individual, effort, during, the, years, 1861, to, 1892, the, land, owned, by, the, nobles, decreased, 30, or, from, 850, 000, to, 610, 000, km, 2, 210, 000, 000, to, 150, 000, 000, acres, during, the, following, four, years, an, additional, 8, 577, km, 2, 2, 119, 500, acres, were, sold, and, since, then, the, sales, went, on, at, an, accelerated, rate, until, in, 1903, alone, close, to, 8, 000, km, 2, 2, 000, 000, acres, passed, out, of, their, hands, on, the, other, hand, since, 1861, and, more, especially, since, 1882, when, the, peasant, land, bank, was, founded, for, making, advances, to, peasants, who, were, desirous, of, purchasing, land, the, former, serfs, or, rather, their, descendants, had, between, 1883, and, 1904, bought, about, 78, 900, km, 2, 19, 500, 000, acres, from, their, former, masters, in, november, 1906, however, emperor, nicholas, ii, promulgated, a, provisional, order, permitting, the, peasants, to, become, freeholders, of, allotments, made, at, the, time, of, emancipation, all, redemption, dues, being, remitted, this, measure, which, was, endorsed, by, the, third, duma, in, an, act, passed, on, 21, december, 1908, was, calculated, to, have, far, reaching, and, profound, effects, on, the, rural, economy, of, russia, thirteen, years, previously, the, government, had, endeavored, to, secure, greater, fixity, and, permanence, of, tenure, by, providing, that, at, least, twelve, years, must, elapse, between, every, two, redistributions, of, the, land, belonging, to, a, mir, amongst, those, entitled, to, share, in, it, the, order, of, november, 1906, provided, that, the, various, strips, of, land, held, by, each, peasant, should, be, merged, into, a, single, holding, the, duma, however, on, the, advice, of,
