in, modern, historiography, the, western, roman, empire, was, the, western, provinces, of, the, roman, empire, collectively, during, any, period, in, which, they, were, administered, separately, from, the, eastern, provinces, by, a, separate, independent, imperial, court, particularly, during, the, period, from, ad, 395, to, 476, there, were, separate, coequal, courts, dividing, the, governance, of, the, empire, into, the, western, provinces, and, the, eastern, provinces, with, a, distinct, imperial, succession, in, the, separate, courts, the, terms, western, roman, empire, and, eastern, roman, empire, were, coined, in, modern, times, to, describe, political, entities, that, were, de, facto, independent, contemporary, romans, did, not, consider, the, empire, to, have, been, split, into, two, empires, but, viewed, it, as, a, single, polity, governed, by, two, imperial, courts, for, administrative, expediency, the, western, empire, collapsed, in, 476, and, the, western, imperial, court, in, ravenna, disappeared, by, ad, 554, at, the, end, of, justinian, s, gothic, war, though, there, were, periods, with, more, than, one, emperor, ruling, jointly, before, the, view, that, it, was, impossible, for, a, single, emperor, to, govern, the, entire, empire, was, institutionalized, by, emperor, diocletian, following, the, disastrous, civil, wars, and, disintegrations, of, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, he, introduced, the, system, of, the, tetrarchy, in, 286, with, two, senior, emperors, titled, augustus, one, in, the, east, and, one, in, the, west, each, with, an, appointed, subordinate, and, heir, titled, caesar, though, the, tetrarchic, system, would, collapse, in, a, matter, of, years, the, east, west, administrative, division, would, endure, in, one, form, or, another, over, the, coming, centuries, as, such, the, unofficial, western, roman, empire, would, exist, intermittently, in, several, periods, between, the, 3rd, and, 5th, centuries, some, emperors, such, as, constantine, i, and, theodosius, i, governed, if, briefly, as, the, sole, augustus, across, the, roman, empire, on, the, death, of, theodosius, in, 395, the, empire, was, divided, between, his, two, infant, sons, with, honorius, as, his, successor, in, the, west, governing, briefly, from, mediolanum, then, from, ravenna, and, arcadius, as, his, successor, in, the, east, governing, from, constantinople, in, 476, after, the, battle, of, ravenna, the, roman, army, in, the, west, suffered, defeat, at, the, hands, of, odoacer, and, his, germanic, foederati, odoacer, forced, the, abdication, of, the, emperor, romulus, augustulus, and, became, the, first, king, of, italy, in, 480, following, the, assassination, of, the, previous, western, emperor, julius, nepos, the, eastern, emperor, zeno, dissolved, the, western, court, and, proclaimed, himself, the, sole, emperor, of, the, roman, empire, the, date, of, 476, was, popularized, by, the, 18th, century, british, historian, edward, gibbon, as, a, demarcating, event, for, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, and, is, sometimes, used, to, mark, the, transition, from, antiquity, to, the, middle, ages, odoacer, s, italy, and, other, barbarian, kingdoms, many, of, them, representing, former, western, roman, allies, that, had, been, granted, lands, in, return, for, military, assistance, would, maintain, a, pretense, of, roman, continuity, through, the, continued, use, of, the, old, roman, administrative, systems, and, nominal, subservience, to, the, eastern, roman, court, in, the, 6th, century, emperor, justinian, i, re, imposed, direct, imperial, rule, on, large, parts, of, the, former, western, roman, empire, including, the, prosperous, regions, of, north, africa, the, ancient, roman, heartland, of, italy, and, parts, of, hispania, political, instability, in, the, eastern, heartlands, combined, with, foreign, invasions, plague, and, religious, differences, made, efforts, to, retain, control, of, these, territories, difficult, and, they, were, gradually, lost, for, good, though, the, eastern, empire, retained, territories, in, the, south, of, italy, until, the, eleventh, century, the, influence, that, the, empire, had, over, western, europe, had, diminished, significantly, the, papal, coronation, of, the, frankish, king, charlemagne, as, roman, emperor, in, 800, marked, a, new, imperial, line, that, would, evolve, into, the, holy, roman, empire, which, presented, a, revival, of, the, imperial, title, in, western, europe, but, was, in, no, meaningful, sense, an, extension, of, roman, traditions, or, institutions, the, great, schism, of, 1054, between, the, churches, of, rome, and, constantinople, further, diminished, any, authority, the, emperor, in, constantinople, could, hope, to, exert, in, the, west, as, the, roman, republic, expanded, it, reached, a, point, where, the, central, government, in, rome, could, not, effectively, rule, the, distant, provinces, communications, and, transportation, were, especially, problematic, given, the, vast, extent, of, the, empire, news, of, invasion, revolt, natural, disasters, or, epidemic, outbreak, was, carried, by, ship, or, mounted, postal, service, often, requiring, much, time, to, reach, rome, and, for, rome, s, orders, to, be, returned, and, acted, upon, therefore, provincial, governors, had, de, facto, autonomy, in, the, name, of, the, roman, republic, governors, had, several, duties, including, the, command, of, armies, handling, the, taxes, of, the, province, and, serving, as, the, province, s, chief, judges, prior, to, the, establishment, of, the, empire, the, territories, of, the, roman, republic, had, been, divided, in, 43, bc, among, the, members, of, the, second, triumvirate, mark, antony, octavian, and, marcus, aemilius, lepidus, antony, received, the, provinces, in, the, east, achaea, macedonia, and, epirus, roughly, modern, greece, albania, and, the, coast, of, croatia, bithynia, pontus, and, asia, roughly, modern, turkey, syria, cyprus, and, cyrenaica, these, lands, had, previously, been, conquered, by, alexander, the, great, thus, much, of, the, aristocracy, was, of, greek, origin, the, whole, region, especially, the, major, cities, had, been, largely, assimilated, into, greek, culture, greek, often, serving, as, the, lingua, franca, octavian, obtained, the, roman, provinces, of, the, west, italia, modern, italy, gaul, modern, france, gallia, belgica, parts, of, modern, belgium, the, netherlands, and, luxembourg, and, hispania, modern, spain, and, portugal, these, lands, also, included, greek, and, carthaginian, colonies, in, the, coastal, areas, though, celtic, tribes, such, as, gauls, and, celtiberians, were, culturally, dominant, lepidus, received, the, minor, province, of, africa, roughly, modern, tunisia, octavian, soon, took, africa, from, lepidus, while, adding, sicilia, modern, sicily, to, his, holdings, upon, the, defeat, of, mark, antony, a, victorious, octavian, controlled, a, united, roman, empire, the, empire, featured, many, distinct, cultures, all, experienced, a, gradual, romanization, while, the, predominantly, greek, culture, of, the, east, and, the, predominantly, latin, culture, of, the, west, functioned, effectively, as, an, integrated, whole, political, and, military, developments, would, ultimately, realign, the, empire, along, those, cultural, and, linguistic, lines, more, often, than, not, greek, and, latin, practices, and, to, some, extent, the, languages, themselves, would, be, combined, in, fields, such, as, history, e, g, those, by, cato, the, elder, philosophy, and, rhetoric, minor, rebellions, and, uprisings, were, fairly, common, events, throughout, the, empire, conquered, tribes, or, oppressed, cities, would, revolt, and, the, legions, would, be, detached, to, crush, the, rebellion, while, this, process, was, simple, in, peacetime, it, could, be, considerably, more, complicated, in, wartime, in, a, full, blown, military, campaign, the, legions, were, far, more, numerous, as, for, example, those, led, by, vespasian, in, the, first, jewish, roman, war, to, ensure, a, commander, s, loyalty, a, pragmatic, emperor, might, hold, some, members, of, the, general, s, family, hostage, to, this, end, nero, effectively, held, domitian, and, quintus, petillius, cerialis, governor, of, ostia, who, were, respectively, the, younger, son, and, brother, in, law, of, vespasian, nero, s, rule, was, ended, by, a, revolt, of, the, praetorian, guard, who, had, been, bribed, in, the, name, of, galba, the, praetorian, guard, a, figurative, sword, of, damocles, was, often, perceived, as, being, of, dubious, loyalty, primarily, due, its, role, in, court, intrigues, and, in, overthrowing, several, emperors, including, pertinax, and, aurelian, following, their, example, the, legions, at, the, borders, increasingly, participated, in, civil, wars, for, instance, legions, stationed, in, egypt, and, the, eastern, provinces, would, see, significant, participation, in, the, civil, war, of, 218, between, emperor, macrinus, and, elagabalus, as, the, empire, expanded, two, key, frontiers, revealed, themselves, in, the, west, behind, the, rivers, rhine, and, danube, germanic, tribes, were, an, important, enemy, augustus, the, first, emperor, had, tried, to, conquer, them, but, had, pulled, back, after, the, disastrous, battle, of, the, teutoburg, forest, whilst, the, germanic, tribes, were, formidable, foes, the, parthian, empire, in, the, east, presented, the, greatest, threat, to, the, empire, the, parthians, were, too, remote, and, powerful, to, be, conquered, and, there, was, a, constant, parthian, threat, of, invasion, the, parthians, repelled, several, roman, invasions, and, even, after, successful, wars, of, conquest, such, as, those, implemented, by, trajan, or, septimius, severus, the, conquered, territories, were, forsaken, in, attempts, to, ensure, a, lasting, peace, with, the, parthians, the, parthian, empire, would, be, succeeded, by, the, sasanian, empire, which, continued, hostilities, with, the, roman, empire, controlling, the, western, border, of, rome, was, reasonably, easy, because, it, was, relatively, close, to, rome, itself, and, also, because, of, the, disunity, among, the, germans, however, controlling, both, frontiers, simultaneously, during, wartime, was, difficult, if, the, emperor, was, near, the, border, in, the, east, the, chances, were, high, that, an, ambitious, general, would, rebel, in, the, west, and, vice, versa, this, wartime, opportunism, plagued, many, ruling, emperors, and, indeed, paved, the, road, to, power, for, several, future, emperors, by, the, time, of, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, usurpation, became, a, common, method, of, succession, philip, the, arab, trebonianus, gallus, and, aemilianus, were, all, usurping, generals, turned, emperors, whose, rule, would, end, with, usurpation, by, another, powerful, general, the, idea, of, co, emperorship, was, first, tested, by, marcus, aurelius, r, 161, 180, who, decided, to, rule, alongside, his, adoptive, brother, lucius, verus, there, was, however, much, precedent, the, consulate, of, the, republic, was, a, twin, magistracy, and, earlier, emperors, had, often, had, a, subordinate, lieutenant, with, many, imperial, offices, many, emperors, had, planned, a, joint, succession, in, the, past, augustus, planned, to, leave, gaius, and, lucius, caesar, as, joint, emperors, on, his, death, tiberius, wished, to, have, caligula, and, tiberius, gemellus, do, so, as, well, as, claudius, with, nero, and, britannicus, all, of, these, arrangements, had, ended, in, failure, either, through, premature, death, gaius, and, lucius, or, murder, gemellus, and, britannicus, marcus, aurelius, ruled, mostly, from, the, west, while, verus, spent, most, of, his, reign, campaigning, in, the, east, against, parthia, verus, accompanied, marcus, at, the, start, of, the, marcomannic, wars, but, died, shortly, after, decades, later, septimius, severus, r, 193, 211, appointed, his, sons, geta, and, caracalla, as, joint, heirs, however, caracalla, murdered, his, brother, shortly, after, succeeding, to, the, throne, with, the, assassination, of, the, emperor, alexander, severus, in, march, 235, by, his, own, troops, the, roman, empire, sank, into, a, 50, year, period, of, civil, war, now, known, as, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, during, this, period, the, empire, saw, the, combined, pressures, of, barbarian, invasions, and, migrations, into, roman, territory, civil, wars, peasant, rebellions, and, political, instability, with, multiple, usurpers, competing, for, power, the, idea, of, dividing, the, empire, was, first, developed, in, this, time, valerian, and, his, son, gallienus, divided, the, empire, between, them, the, former, ruling, from, the, east, and, the, latter, from, the, west, however, valerian, was, captured, by, the, sassanids, at, the, battle, of, edessa, leaving, gallienus, as, sole, emperor, saloninus, gallienus, infant, son, and, the, praetorian, prefect, silvanus, resided, in, colonia, agrippina, modern, cologne, to, solidify, the, loyalty, of, the, local, legions, nevertheless, postumus, the, local, governor, of, the, german, provinces, rebelled, and, his, assault, on, colonia, agrippina, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, saloninus, and, the, prefect, in, the, confusion, that, followed, an, independent, state, known, in, modern, historiography, as, the, gallic, empire, emerged, its, capital, was, augusta, treverorum, modern, trier, and, it, quickly, expanded, its, control, over, the, german, and, gaulish, provinces, all, of, hispania, and, britannia, it, had, its, own, senate, and, a, partial, list, of, its, consuls, still, survives, it, maintained, roman, religion, language, and, culture, and, was, far, more, concerned, with, fighting, the, germanic, tribes, fending, off, germanic, incursions, and, restoring, the, security, the, gallic, provinces, had, enjoyed, in, the, past, than, in, challenging, the, roman, central, government, in, the, reign, of, claudius, gothicus, 268, 270, large, expanses, of, the, gallic, empire, were, restored, to, roman, rule, at, roughly, the, same, time, however, several, eastern, provinces, seceded, to, form, the, palmyrene, empire, under, the, rule, of, queen, zenobia, in, 272, emperor, aurelian, finally, managed, to, reclaim, palmyra, and, its, territory, for, the, empire, with, the, east, secure, his, attention, turned, to, the, west, invading, the, gallic, empire, a, year, later, aurelian, decisively, defeated, tetricus, i, in, the, battle, of, ch, lons, and, soon, captured, tetricus, and, his, son, tetricus, ii, both, zenobia, and, the, tetrici, were, pardoned, although, they, were, first, paraded, in, a, triumph, diocletian, divided, the, roman, empire, when, in, 286, he, elevated, maximian, to, the, rank, of, augustus, emperor, and, gave, him, control, of, the, western, empire, while, he, continued, to, rule, the, east, in, 293, galerius, and, constantius, chlorus, were, appointed, as, their, subordinate, caesars, as, a, way, to, avoid, the, civil, unrest, that, had, marked, the, 3rd, century, this, system, effectively, divided, the, empire, into, four, major, regions, the, first, tetrarchy, in, the, west, maximian, made, mediolanum, now, milan, his, capital, and, constantius, made, trier, his, in, the, east, galerius, made, his, capital, sirmium, and, diocletian, made, nicomedia, his, on, 1, may, 305, diocletian, and, maximian, abdicated, replaced, by, galerius, and, constantius, who, in, turn, appointed, maximinus, ii, and, valerius, severus, respectively, as, their, caesars, thus, creating, the, second, tetrarchy, the, tetrarchy, collapsed, after, the, unexpected, death, of, constantius, in, 306, his, son, constantine, was, declared, western, emperor, by, the, british, legions, but, several, other, claimants, arose, and, attempted, to, seize, the, western, empire, in, 308, galerius, revived, the, tetrarchy, by, dividing, the, western, empire, between, constantine, and, licinius, however, constantine, was, more, interested, in, conquering, the, whole, empire, so, by, 314, began, to, compete, against, licinius, finally, defeating, him, in, 324, at, the, battle, of, chrysopolis, after, constantine, unified, the, empire, he, refounded, the, city, of, byzantium, in, modern, day, turkey, as, nova, roma, new, rome, later, called, constantinople, and, made, it, the, capital, of, the, roman, empire, although, the, tetrarchy, was, ended, the, concept, of, physically, dividing, the, roman, empire, into, east, and, a, west, continued, as, happened, after, the, deaths, of, constantine, and, theodosius, i, the, roman, empire, was, under, the, rule, of, a, single, emperor, but, with, the, death, of, constantine, in, 337, the, empire, was, partitioned, between, his, surviving, male, heirs, constantius, his, third, son, and, the, second, by, his, wife, fausta, maximian, s, daughter, received, the, eastern, provinces, including, constantinople, thrace, asia, minor, syria, egypt, and, cyrenaica, constantine, ii, received, britannia, gaul, hispania, and, mauretania, and, constans, initially, under, the, supervision, of, constantine, ii, received, italy, africa, illyricum, pannonia, macedonia, and, achaea, the, provinces, of, thrace, achaea, and, macedonia, were, shortly, controlled, by, dalmatius, nephew, of, constantine, i, and, a, caesar, not, an, augustus, until, his, murder, by, his, own, soldiers, in, 337, the, west, was, unified, in, 340, under, constans, who, was, assassinated, in, 350, under, the, order, of, the, usurper, magnentius, after, magnentius, lost, the, battle, of, mursa, major, and, committed, suicide, a, complete, reunification, of, the, whole, empire, occurred, under, constantius, in, 353, constantius, ii, focused, most, of, his, power, in, the, east, under, his, rule, the, city, of, byzantium, only, recently, re, founded, as, constantinople, was, fully, developed, as, a, capital, at, constantinople, the, political, economic, and, military, control, of, the, eastern, empire, s, resources, would, remain, safe, for, centuries, to, come, the, city, was, well, fortified, and, located, at, the, crossroads, of, several, major, trade, and, military, routes, the, site, had, been, acknowledged, for, its, strategic, importance, already, by, emperors, septimius, severus, and, caracalla, more, than, a, century, prior, in, 361, constantius, ii, became, ill, and, died, and, constantius, chlorus, grandson, julian, who, had, served, as, constantius, ii, s, caesar, assumed, power, julian, was, killed, in, 363, in, the, battle, of, samarra, against, the, persian, empire, and, was, succeeded, by, jovian, who, ruled, for, only, nine, months, following, the, death, of, jovian, valentinian, i, emerged, as, emperor, in, 364, he, immediately, divided, the, empire, once, again, giving, the, eastern, half, to, his, brother, valens, stability, was, not, achieved, for, long, in, either, half, as, the, conflicts, with, outside, forces, barbarian, tribes, intensified, in, 376, the, visigoths, fleeing, before, the, ostrogoths, who, in, turn, were, fleeing, before, the, huns, were, allowed, to, cross, the, river, danube, and, settle, in, the, balkans, by, the, eastern, government, mistreatment, caused, a, full, scale, rebellion, and, in, 378, they, inflicted, a, crippling, defeat, on, the, eastern, roman, field, army, in, the, battle, of, adrianople, in, which, emperor, valens, also, died, the, defeat, at, adrianople, was, shocking, to, the, romans, and, forced, them, to, negotiate, with, and, settle, the, visigoths, within, the, borders, of, the, empire, where, they, would, become, semi, independent, foederati, under, their, own, leaders, more, than, in, the, east, there, was, also, opposition, to, the, christianizing, policy, of, the, emperors, in, the, western, part, of, the, empire, in, 379, valentinian, i, s, son, and, successor, gratian, declined, to, wear, the, mantle, of, pontifex, maximus, and, in, 382, he, rescinded, the, rights, of, pagan, priests, and, removed, the, altar, of, victory, from, the, roman, curia, a, decision, which, caused, dissatisfaction, among, the, traditionally, pagan, aristocracy, of, rome, the, political, situation, was, unstable, in, 383, a, powerful, and, popular, general, named, magnus, maximus, seized, power, in, the, west, and, forced, gratian, s, half, brother, valentinian, ii, to, flee, to, the, east, for, aid, in, a, destructive, civil, war, the, eastern, emperor, theodosius, i, restored, him, to, power, in, 392, the, frankish, and, pagan, magister, militum, arbogast, assassinated, valentinian, ii, and, proclaimed, an, obscure, senator, named, eugenius, as, emperor, in, 394, the, forces, of, the, two, halves, of, the, empire, again, clashed, with, great, loss, of, life, again, theodosius, i, won, and, he, briefly, ruled, a, united, empire, until, his, death, in, 395, he, was, the, last, emperor, to, rule, both, parts, of, the, roman, empire, before, the, west, fragmented, and, collapsed, theodosius, i, s, older, son, arcadius, inherited, the, eastern, half, while, the, younger, honorius, got, the, western, half, both, were, still, minors, and, neither, was, capable, of, ruling, effectively, honorius, was, placed, under, the, tutelage, of, the, half, roman, half, barbarian, magister, militum, flavius, stilicho, while, rufinus, became, the, power, behind, the, throne, in, the, east, rufinus, and, stilicho, were, rivals, and, their, disagreements, would, be, exploited, by, the, gothic, leader, alaric, i, who, again, rebelled, in, 408, following, the, massacre, by, roman, legions, of, thousands, of, barbarian, families, who, were, trying, to, assimilate, into, the, roman, empire, neither, half, of, the, empire, could, raise, forces, sufficient, even, to, subdue, alaric, s, men, and, both, tried, to, use, alaric, against, the, other, half, alaric, himself, tried, to, establish, a, long, term, territorial, and, official, base, but, was, never, able, to, do, so, stilicho, tried, to, defend, italy, and, bring, the, invading, goths, under, control, but, to, do, so, he, stripped, the, rhine, frontier, of, troops, and, the, vandals, alans, and, suevi, invaded, gaul, in, large, numbers, in, 406, stilicho, became, a, victim, of, court, intrigues, and, was, killed, in, 408, while, the, east, began, a, slow, recovery, and, consolidation, the, west, began, to, collapse, entirely, alaric, s, men, sacked, rome, in, 410, honorius, the, younger, son, of, theodosius, i, was, declared, augustus, and, as, such, co, emperor, with, his, father, on, 23, january, in, 393, at, the, age, of, 9, upon, the, death, of, theodosius, honorius, inherited, the, throne, of, the, west, at, the, age, of, ten, whilst, his, older, brother, arcadius, inherited, the, east, the, western, capital, was, initially, mediolanum, as, it, had, been, during, previous, divisions, but, it, was, moved, to, ravenna, in, 401, upon, the, entry, of, the, visigothic, king, alaric, i, into, italy, ravenna, protected, by, abundant, marshes, and, strong, fortifications, was, far, easier, to, defend, and, had, easy, access, to, the, imperial, fleet, of, the, eastern, empire, but, made, it, more, difficult, for, the, roman, military, to, defend, the, central, parts, of, italy, from, regular, barbarian, incursions, ravenna, would, remain, the, western, capital, until, 450, when, valentinian, iii, moved, the, court, back, to, rome, most, western, emperors, from, 450, until, 475, reigned, from, rome, the, last, de, facto, western, emperor, romulus, augustulus, resided, in, ravenna, from, 475, until, his, deposition, in, 476, and, ravenna, would, later, be, the, capital, of, both, the, ostrogothic, kingdom, and, the, exarchate, of, ravenna, despite, the, moved, capital, economic, power, remained, focused, on, rome, and, its, rich, senatorial, aristocracy, which, dominated, much, of, italy, and, africa, in, particular, after, emperor, gallienus, had, banned, senators, from, army, commands, in, the, mid, 3rd, century, the, senatorial, elite, lost, all, experience, of, and, interest, in, military, life, in, the, early, 5th, century, the, wealthy, landowning, elite, of, the, roman, senate, largely, barred, its, tenants, from, military, service, but, it, also, refused, to, approve, sufficient, funding, for, maintaining, a, sufficiently, powerful, mercenary, army, to, defend, the, entire, western, empire, the, west, s, most, important, military, area, had, been, northern, gaul, and, the, rhine, frontier, in, the, 4th, century, when, trier, frequently, served, as, a, military, capital, of, sorts, for, the, empire, many, leading, western, generals, were, barbarians, the, reign, of, honorius, was, even, by, western, roman, standards, chaotic, and, plagued, by, both, internal, and, external, struggles, the, visigothic, foederati, under, alaric, magister, militum, in, illyricum, rebelled, in, 395, gildo, the, comes, africae, and, magister, utriusque,

stilicho, hurrying, back, to, aid, in, defending, italy, summoned, legions, in, gaul, and, britain, with, which, he, managed, to, defeat, alaric, twice, before, agreeing, to, allow, him, to, retreat, back, to, illyria, the, weakening, of, the, frontiers, in, britain, and, gaul, had, dire, consequences, for, the, empire, as, the, imperial, government, was, not, providing, the, military, protection, the, northern, provinces, expected, and, needed, numerous, usurpers, arose, in, britain, including, marcus, 406, 407, gratian, 407, and, constantine, iii, who, invaded, gaul, in, 407, britain, was, effectively, abandoned, by, the, empire, by, 410, due, to, the, lack, of, resources, and, the, need, to, look, after, more, important, frontiers, the, weakening, of, the, rhine, frontier, allowed, multiple, barbarian, tribes, including, the, vandals, alans, and, suebi, to, cross, the, river, and, enter, roman, territory, in, 406, honorius, was, convinced, by, the, minister, olympius, that, stilicho, was, conspiring, to, overthrow, him, and, so, arrested, and, executed, stilicho, in, 408, olympius, headed, a, conspiracy, that, orchestrated, the, deaths, of, key, individuals, related, to, the, faction, of, stilicho, including, his, son, and, the, families, of, many, of, his, federated, troops, this, led, many, of, the, soldiers, to, instead, join, with, alaric, who, returned, to, italy, in, 409, and, met, little, opposition, despite, attempts, by, honorius, to, reach, a, settlement, and, six, legions, of, eastern, roman, soldiers, sent, to, support, him, the, negotiations, between, alaric, and, honorius, broke, down, in, 410, and, alaric, sacked, the, city, of, rome, though, the, sack, was, relatively, mild, and, rome, was, no, longer, the, capital, of, even, the, western, empire, the, event, shocked, people, across, both, halves, of, the, empire, as, this, was, the, first, time, rome, viewed, at, least, as, the, symbolic, heart, of, the, empire, had, fallen, to, a, foreign, enemy, since, the, gallic, invasions, of, the, 4th, century, bc, the, eastern, roman, emperor, theodosius, ii, the, successor, of, arcadius, declared, three, days, of, mourning, in, constantinople, without, stilicho, and, following, the, sack, of, rome, honorius, reign, grew, more, chaotic, the, usurper, constantine, iii, had, stripped, roman, britain, of, its, defenses, when, he, crossed, over, to, gaul, in, 407, leaving, the, romanized, population, subject, to, invasions, first, by, the, picts, and, then, by, the, saxons, angli, and, the, jutes, who, began, to, settle, permanently, from, about, 440, onwards, after, honorius, accepted, constantine, as, co, emperor, constantine, s, general, in, hispania, gerontius, proclaimed, maximus, as, emperor, with, the, aid, of, general, constantius, honorius, defeated, gerontius, and, maximus, in, 411, and, shortly, thereafter, captured, and, executed, constantine, iii, with, constantius, back, in, italy, the, gallo, roman, senator, jovinus, revolted, after, proclaiming, himself, emperor, with, the, support, of, the, gallic, nobility, and, the, barbarian, burgundians, and, alans, honorius, turned, to, the, visigoths, under, king, athaulf, for, support, athaulf, defeated, and, executed, jovinus, and, his, proclaimed, co, emperor, sebastianus, in, 413, around, the, same, time, as, another, usurper, arose, in, africa, heraclianus, heraclianus, attempted, to, invade, italy, but, failed, and, retreated, to, carthage, where, he, was, killed, with, the, roman, legions, withdrawn, northern, gaul, became, increasingly, subject, to, frankish, influence, the, franks, naturally, adopting, a, leading, role, in, the, region, in, 418, honorius, granted, southwestern, gaul, gallia, aquitania, to, the, visigoths, as, a, vassal, federation, honorius, removed, the, local, imperial, governors, leaving, the, visigoths, and, the, provincial, roman, inhabitants, to, conduct, their, own, affairs, as, such, the, first, of, the, barbarian, kingdoms, the, visigothic, kingdom, was, formed, honorius, death, in, 423, was, followed, by, turmoil, until, the, eastern, roman, government, installed, valentinian, iii, as, western, emperor, in, ravenna, by, force, of, arms, with, galla, placidia, acting, as, regent, during, her, son, s, minority, theodosius, ii, the, eastern, emperor, had, hesitated, to, announce, the, death, of, honorius, and, in, the, ensuing, interregnum, joannes, was, nominated, as, western, emperor, joannes, rule, was, short, and, the, forces, of, the, east, defeated, and, executed, him, in, 425, after, a, violent, struggle, with, several, rivals, and, against, placidia, s, wish, aetius, rose, to, the, rank, of, magister, militum, aetius, was, able, to, stabilize, the, western, empire, s, military, situation, somewhat, relying, heavily, on, his, hunnic, allies, with, their, help, aetius, undertook, extensive, campaigns, in, gaul, defeating, the, visigoths, in, 437, and, 438, but, suffering, a, defeat, himself, in, 439, ending, the, conflict, in, a, status, quo, ante, with, a, treaty, meanwhile, pressure, from, the, visigoths, and, a, rebellion, by, bonifacius, the, governor, of, africa, induced, the, vandals, under, king, gaiseric, to, cross, from, spain, to, tingitana, in, what, is, now, morocco, in, 429, they, temporarily, halted, in, numidia, in, 435, before, moving, eastward, with, aetius, occupied, in, gaul, the, western, roman, government, could, do, nothing, to, prevent, the, vandals, conquering, the, wealthy, african, provinces, culminating, in, the, fall, of, carthage, on, 19, october, 439, and, the, establishment, of, the, vandal, kingdom, by, the, 400s, italy, and, rome, itself, were, dependent, on, the, taxes, and, foodstuffs, from, these, provinces, leading, to, an, economic, crisis, with, vandal, fleets, becoming, an, increasing, danger, to, roman, sea, trade, and, the, coasts, and, islands, of, the, western, and, central, mediterranean, aetius, coordinated, a, counterattack, against, the, vandals, in, 440, organizing, a, large, army, in, sicily, however, the, plans, for, retaking, africa, had, to, be, abandoned, due, to, the, immediate, need, to, combat, the, invading, huns, who, in, 444, were, united, under, their, ambitious, king, attila, turning, against, their, former, ally, the, huns, became, a, formidable, threat, to, the, empire, aetius, transferred, his, forces, to, the, danube, though, attila, concentrated, on, raiding, the, eastern, roman, provinces, in, the, balkans, providing, temporary, relief, to, the, western, empire, in, 449, attila, received, a, message, from, honoria, valentinian, iii, s, sister, offering, him, half, the, western, empire, if, he, would, rescue, her, from, an, unwanted, marriage, that, her, brother, was, forcing, her, into, with, a, pretext, to, invade, the, west, attila, secured, peace, with, the, eastern, court, and, crossed, the, rhine, in, early, 451, with, attila, wreaking, havoc, in, gaul, aetius, gathered, a, coalition, of, roman, and, germanic, forces, including, visigoths, and, burgundians, and, prevented, the, huns, from, taking, the, city, of, aurelianum, forcing, them, into, retreat, at, the, battle, of, the, catalaunian, plains, the, roman, germanic, coalition, met, and, defeated, the, hunnic, forces, though, attila, escaped, attila, regrouped, and, invaded, italy, in, 452, with, aetius, not, having, enough, forces, to, attack, him, the, road, to, rome, was, open, valentinian, sent, pope, leo, i, and, two, leading, senators, to, negotiate, with, attila, this, embassy, combined, with, a, plague, among, attila, s, troops, the, threat, of, famine, and, news, that, the, eastern, emperor, marcian, had, launched, an, attack, on, the, hun, homelands, along, the, danube, forced, attila, to, turn, back, and, leave, italy, when, attila, died, unexpectedly, in, 453, the, power, struggle, that, erupted, between, his, sons, ended, the, threat, posed, by, the, huns, valentinian, iii, was, intimidated, by, aetius, and, was, encouraged, by, the, roman, senator, petronius, maximus, and, the, chamberlain, heraclius, to, assassinate, him, when, aetius, was, at, court, in, ravenna, delivering, a, financial, account, valentinian, suddenly, leaped, from, his, seat, and, declared, that, he, would, no, longer, be, the, victim, of, aetius, drunken, depravities, aetius, attempted, to, defend, himself, from, the, charges, but, valentinian, drew, his, sword, and, struck, the, weaponless, aetius, on, the, head, killing, him, on, the, spot, on, 16, march, the, following, year, valentinian, himself, was, killed, by, supporters, of, the, dead, general, possibly, acting, for, petronius, maximus, with, the, end, of, the, theodosian, dynasty, petronius, maximus, proclaimed, himself, emperor, during, the, ensuing, period, of, unrest, petronius, was, not, able, to, take, effective, control, of, the, significantly, weakened, and, unstable, empire, he, broke, the, betrothal, between, huneric, son, of, the, vandal, king, gaiseric, and, eudocia, daughter, of, valentinian, iii, this, was, seen, as, a, just, cause, of, war, by, king, gaiseric, who, set, sail, to, attack, rome, petronius, and, his, supporters, attempted, to, flee, the, city, at, the, sight, of, the, approaching, vandals, only, to, be, stoned, to, death, by, a, roman, mob, petronius, had, reigned, only, 11, weeks, with, the, vandals, at, the, gates, pope, leo, i, requested, that, the, king, not, destroy, the, ancient, city, or, murder, its, inhabitants, to, which, gaiseric, agreed, and, the, city, gates, were, opened, to, him, though, keeping, his, promise, gaiseric, looted, great, amounts, of, treasure, and, damaged, objects, of, cultural, significance, such, as, the, temple, of, jupiter, optimus, maximus, the, severity, of, the, vandal, sack, of, 455, is, disputed, though, with, the, vandals, plundering, the, city, for, a, full, fourteen, days, as, opposed, to, the, visigothic, sack, of, 410, where, the, visigoths, only, spent, three, days, in, the, city, it, was, likely, more, thorough, avitus, a, prominent, general, under, petronius, was, proclaimed, emperor, by, the, visigothic, king, theodoric, ii, and, accepted, as, such, by, the, roman, senate, though, supported, by, the, gallic, provinces, and, the, visigoths, avitus, was, resented, in, italy, due, to, ongoing, food, shortages, caused, by, vandal, control, of, trade, routes, and, for, using, a, visigothic, imperial, guard, he, disbanded, his, guard, due, to, popular, pressure, and, the, suebian, general, ricimer, used, the, opportunity, to, depose, avitus, counting, on, popular, discontent, after, the, deposition, of, avitus, the, eastern, emperor, leo, i, did, not, select, a, new, western, augustus, the, prominent, general, majorian, defeated, an, invading, force, of, alemanni, and, was, subsequently, proclaimed, western, emperor, by, the, army, and, eventually, accepted, as, such, by, leo, majorian, was, the, last, western, emperor, to, attempt, to, recover, the, western, empire, with, his, own, military, forces, to, prepare, majorian, significantly, strengthened, the, western, roman, army, by, recruiting, large, numbers, of, barbarian, mercenaries, among, them, the, gepids, ostrogoths, rugii, burgundians, huns, bastarnae, suebi, scythians, and, alans, and, built, two, fleets, one, at, ravenna, to, combat, the, strong, vandalic, fleet, majorian, personally, led, the, army, to, wage, war, in, gaul, leaving, ricimer, in, italy, the, gallic, provinces, and, the, visigothic, kingdom, had, rebelled, following, the, deposition, of, avitus, refusing, to, acknowledge, majorian, as, lawful, emperor, at, the, battle, of, arelate, majorian, decisively, defeated, the, visigoths, under, theoderic, ii, and, forced, them, to, relinquish, their, great, conquests, in, hispania, and, return, to, foederati, status, majorian, then, entered, the, rhone, valley, where, he, defeated, the, burgundians, and, reconquered, the, rebel, city, of, lugdunum, with, gaul, back, under, roman, control, majorian, turned, his, eyes, to, the, vandals, and, africa, not, only, did, the, vandals, pose, a, constant, danger, to, coastal, italy, and, trade, in, the, mediterranean, but, the, province, they, ruled, was, economically, vital, to, the, survival, of, the, west, majorian, began, a, campaign, to, fully, reconquer, hispania, to, use, it, as, a, base, for, the, reconquest, of, africa, throughout, 459, majorian, campaigned, against, the, suebi, in, northwestern, hispania, the, vandals, began, to, increasingly, fear, a, roman, invasion, king, gaiseric, tried, to, negotiate, a, peace, with, majorian, who, rejected, the, proposal, in, the, wake, of, this, gaiseric, devastated, mauretania, part, of, his, own, kingdom, fearing, that, the, roman, army, would, land, there, having, regained, control, of, hispania, majorian, intended, to, use, his, fleet, at, carthaginiensis, to, attack, the, vandals, before, he, could, the, fleet, was, destroyed, allegedly, by, traitors, paid, by, the, vandals, deprived, of, his, fleet, majorian, had, to, cancel, his, attack, on, the, vandals, and, conclude, a, peace, with, gaiseric, disbanding, his, barbarian, forces, majorian, intended, to, return, to, rome, and, issue, reforms, stopping, at, arelate, on, his, way, here, ricimer, deposed, and, arrested, him, in, 461, having, gathered, significant, aristocratic, opposition, against, majorian, after, five, days, of, beatings, and, torture, majorian, was, beheaded, near, the, river, iria, the, final, collapse, of, the, empire, in, the, west, was, marked, by, increasingly, ineffectual, puppet, emperors, dominated, by, their, germanic, magistri, militum, the, most, pointed, example, of, this, is, ricimer, who, effectively, became, a, shadow, emperor, following, the, depositions, of, avitus, and, majorian, unable, to, take, the, throne, for, himself, due, to, his, barbarian, heritage, ricimer, appointed, a, series, of, puppet, emperors, who, could, do, little, to, halt, the, collapse, of, roman, authority, and, the, loss, of, the, territories, re, conquered, by, majorian, the, first, of, these, puppet, emperors, libius, severus, had, no, recognition, outside, of, italy, with, the, eastern, emperor, leo, i, and, provincial, governors, in, gaul, and, illyria, all, refusing, to, recognize, him, severus, died, in, 465, and, leo, i, with, the, consent, of, ricimer, appointed, the, capable, eastern, general, anthemius, as, western, emperor, following, an, eighteen, month, interregnum, the, relationship, between, anthemius, and, the, east, was, good, anthemius, is, the, last, western, emperor, recorded, in, an, eastern, law, and, the, two, courts, conducted, a, joint, operation, to, retake, africa, from, the, vandals, culminating, in, the, disastrous, battle, of, cape, bon, in, 468, in, addition, anthemius, conducted, failed, campaigns, against, the, visigoths, hoping, to, halt, their, expansion, the, trial, and, subsequent, execution, of, romanus, an, italian, senator, and, friend, of, ricimer, on, the, grounds, of, treachery, in, 470, made, ricimer, hostile, to, anthemius, following, two, years, of, ill, feeling, ricimer, deposed, and, killed, anthemius, in, 472, elevating, olybrius, to, the, western, throne, during, the, brief, reign, of, olybrius, ricimer, died, and, his, nephew, gundobad, succeeded, him, as, magister, militum, after, only, seven, months, of, rule, olybrius, died, of, dropsy, gundobad, elevated, glycerius, to, western, emperor, the, eastern, empire, had, rejected, olybrius, and, also, rejected, glycerius, instead, supporting, a, candidate, of, their, own, julius, nepos, magister, militum, in, dalmatia, with, the, support, of, eastern, emperors, leo, ii, and, zeno, julius, nepos, crossed, the, adriatic, sea, in, the, spring, of, 474, to, depose, glycerius, at, the, arrival, of, nepos, in, italy, glycerius, abdicated, without, a, fight, and, was, allowed, to, live, out, his, life, as, the, bishop, of, salona, the, brief, rule, of, nepos, in, italy, ended, in, 475, when, orestes, a, former, secretary, of, attila, and, the, magister, militum, of, julius, nepos, took, control, of, ravenna, and, forced, nepos, to, flee, by, ship, to, dalmatia, later, in, the, same, year, orestes, crowned, his, own, young, son, as, western, emperor, under, the, name, romulus, augustus, romulus, augustus, was, not, recognised, as, western, emperor, by, the, eastern, court, who, maintained, that, nepos, was, the, only, legal, western, emperor, reigning, in, exile, from, dalmatia, on, 4, september, 476, odoacer, leader, of, the, germanic, foederati, in, italy, captured, ravenna, killed, orestes, and, deposed, romulus, though, romulus, was, deposed, nepos, did, not, return, to, italy, and, continued, to, reign, as, western, emperor, from, dalmatia, with, support, from, constantinople, odoacer, proclaimed, himself, ruler, of, italy, and, began, to, negotiate, with, the, eastern, emperor, zeno, zeno, eventually, granted, odoacer, patrician, status, as, recognition, of, his, authority, and, accepted, him, as, his, viceroy, of, italy, zeno, however, insisted, that, odoacer, had, to, pay, homage, to, julius, nepos, as, the, emperor, of, the, western, empire, odoacer, accepted, this, condition, and, issued, coins, in, the, name, of, julius, nepos, throughout, italy, this, however, was, mainly, an, empty, political, gesture, as, odoacer, never, returned, any, real, power, or, territories, to, nepos, the, murder, of, nepos, in, 480, prompted, odoacer, to, invade, dalmatia, annexing, it, to, his, kingdom, of, italy, by, convention, the, western, roman, empire, is, deemed, to, have, ended, on, 4, september, 476, when, odoacer, deposed, romulus, augustus, but, the, historical, record, calls, this, determination, into, question, indeed, the, deposition, of, romulus, augustus, received, very, little, attention, in, contemporary, times, romulus, was, a, usurper, in, the, eyes, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, and, the, remaining, territories, of, western, roman, control, outside, of, italy, with, the, previous, emperor, julius, nepos, still, being, alive, and, claiming, to, rule, the, western, empire, in, dalmatia, furthermore, the, western, court, had, lacked, true, power, and, had, been, subject, to, germanic, aristocrats, for, decades, with, most, of, its, legal, territory, being, under, control, of, various, barbarian, kingdoms, with, odoacer, recognising, julius, nepos, and, later, the, eastern, emperor, zeno, as, his, sovereign, nominal, roman, control, continued, in, italy, syagrius, who, had, managed, to, preserve, roman, sovereignty, in, an, exclave, in, northern, gaul, a, realm, today, known, as, the, domain, of, soissons, also, recognized, nepos, as, his, sovereign, and, the, legitimate, western, emperor, the, authority, of, julius, nepos, as, emperor, was, accepted, not, only, by, odoacer, in, italy, but, by, the, eastern, empire, and, syagrius, in, gaul, who, had, not, recognized, romulus, augustulus, nepos, was, murdered, by, his, own, soldiers, in, 480, a, plot, some, attribute, to, odoacer, or, the, previous, deposed, emperor, glycerius, and, the, eastern, emperor, zeno, chose, not, to, appoint, a, new, western, emperor, zeno, recognizing, that, no, true, roman, control, remained, over, the, territories, legally, governed, by, the, western, court, instead, chose, to, abolish, the, juridical, division, of, the, position, of, emperor, and, declared, himself, the, sole, emperor, of, the, roman, empire, zeno, became, the, first, sole, roman, emperor, since, the, division, after, theodosius, i, 85, years, prior, and, the, position, would, never, again, be, divided, as, such, the, eastern, roman, emperors, after, 480, are, the, successors, of, the, western, ones, albeit, only, in, a, juridical, sense, these, emperors, would, continue, to, rule, the, roman, empire, until, the, fall, of, constantinople, in, 1453, nearly, a, thousand, years, later, as, 480, marks, the, end, of, the, juridical, division, of, the, empire, into, two, imperial, courts, some, historians, refer, to, the, death, of, nepos, and, abolition, of, the, western, empire, by, zeno, as, the, end, of, the, western, roman, empire, despite, the, fall, or, abolition, of, the, western, empire, many, of, the, new, kings, of, western, europe, continued, to, operate, firmly, within, a, roman, administrative, framework, this, is, especially, true, in, the, case, of, the, ostrogoths, who, came, to, rule, italy, after, odoacer, they, continued, to, use, the, administrative, systems, of, odoacer, s, kingdom, essentially, those, of, the, western, roman, empire, and, administrative, positions, continued, to, be, staffed, exclusively, by, romans, the, senate, continued, to, function, as, it, always, had, and, the, laws, of, the, empire, were, recognized, as, ruling, the, roman, population, though, the, goths, were, ruled, by, their, own, traditional, laws, western, roman, administrative, institutions, in, particular, those, of, italy, thus, continued, to, be, used, during, barbarian, rule, and, after, the, forces, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, re, conquered, some, of, the, formerly, imperial, territories, some, historians, thus, refer, to, the, reorganizations, of, italy, and, abolition, of, the, old, and, separate, western, roman, administrative, units, such, as, the, praetorian, prefecture, of, italy, during, the, sixth, century, as, the, true, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, roman, cultural, traditions, continued, throughout, the, territory, of, the, western, empire, for, long, after, its, disappearance, and, a, recent, school, of, interpretation, argues, that, the, great, political, changes, can, more, accurately, be, described, as, a, complex, cultural, transformation, rather, than, a, fall, after, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, the, germanic, kingdoms, often, referred, to, as, barbarian, kingdoms, founded, during, its, collapse, continued, to, grow, and, prosper, their, beginnings, together, with, the, end, of, the, western, roman, empire, mark, the, transition, from, late, antiquity, to, the, middle, ages, the, practices, of, the, barbarian, kingdoms, gradually, replaced, the, old, roman, institutions, specifically, in, the, praetorian, prefectures, of, gaul, and, italy, during, the, sixth, and, seventh, centuries, in, many, places, the, roman, institutions, collapsed, along, with, the, economic, stability, in, some, regions, notably, gaul, and, italy, the, settlement, of, barbarians, on, former, roman, lands, seems, to, have, caused, relatively, little, disruption, with, barbarian, rulers, using, and, modifying, the, roman, systems, already, in, place, the, germanic, kingdoms, in, italy, hispania, and, gaul, continued, to, recognise, the, emperor, in, constantinople, as, a, somewhat, nominal, sovereign, the, visigoths, minted, coins, in, their, names, until, the, reign, of, justinian, i, in, the, sixth, century, some, territories, under, direct, roman, control, continued, to, exist, in, the, west, even, after, 480, the, domain, of, soissons, a, rump, state, in, northern, gaul, ruled, by, syagrius, survived, until, 486, when, it, was, conquered, by, the, franks, under, king, clovis, i, after, the, battle, of, soissons, syagrius, was, known, as, the, king, of, the, romans, by, the, germanic, peoples, of, the, region, and, repeatedly, claimed, that, he, was, merely, governing, a, roman, province, not, an, independent, realm, under, clovis, i, from, the, 480s, to, 511, the, franks, would, come, to, develop, into, a, great, regional, power, after, their, conquest, of, soissons, the, franks, defeated, the, alemanni, in, 504, and, conquered, all, visigothic, territory, north, of, the, pyrenees, other, than, septimania, in, 507, relations, between, the, franks, and, the, eastern, empire, appear, to, have, been, positive, with, emperor, anastasius, granting, clovis, the, title, of, consul, following, his, victory, against, the, visigoths, at, the, time, of, its, dissolution, in, the, 800s, the, frankish, kingdom, had, lasted, far, longer, than, the, other, migration, period, barbarian, kingdoms, its, divided, successors, would, develop, into, the, medieval, states, of, france, initially, known, as, west, francia, and, germany, initially, known, as, east, francia, a, mauro, roman, realm, survived, in, the, province, of, mauretania, caesariensis, until, the, early, 8th, century, an, inscription, on, a, fortification, at, the, ruined, city, of, altava, from, the, year, 508, identifies, a, man, named, masuna, as, the, king, of, regnum, maurorum, et, romanarum, the, kingdom, of, the, moors, and,

was, defeated, by, the, eastern, roman, magister, militum, gennadius, in, 578, and, its, coastal, territories, were, incorporated, into, the, empire, once, more, the, deposition, of, romulus, augustus, and, the, rise, of, odoacer, as, ruler, of, italy, in, 476, received, very, little, attention, at, the, time, overall, very, little, changed, for, the, people, there, was, still, a, roman, emperor, in, constantinople, to, whom, odoacer, had, subordinated, himself, interregna, had, been, experienced, at, many, points, in, the, west, before, and, the, deposition, of, romulus, augustus, was, nothing, out, of, the, ordinary, odoacer, saw, his, rule, as, entirely, in, the, tradition, of, the, roman, empire, not, unlike, ricimer, and, he, effectively, ruled, as, an, imperial, governor, of, italy, and, was, even, awarded, the, title, of, patricius, odoacer, ruled, using, the, roman, administrative, systems, already, in, place, and, continued, to, mint, coins, with, the, name, and, portrait, of, julius, nepos, until, 480, and, later, with, the, name, and, portrait, of, the, eastern, augustus, rather, than, in, his, own, name, when, nepos, was, murdered, in, dalmatia, in, 480, odoacer, assumed, the, duty, of, pursuing, and, executing, the, assassins, and, established, his, own, rule, in, dalmatia, at, the, same, time, odoacer, established, his, power, with, the, loyal, support, of, the, roman, senate, a, legislative, body, that, had, continued, even, without, an, emperor, residing, in, italy, indeed, the, senate, seems, to, have, increased, in, power, under, odoacer, for, the, first, time, since, the, mid, 3rd, century, copper, coins, were, issued, with, the, legend, s, c, senatus, consulto, these, coins, were, copied, by, vandals, in, africa, and, also, formed, the, basis, of, the, currency, reform, carried, out, by, emperor, anastasius, in, the, east, under, odoacer, western, consuls, continued, to, be, appointed, as, they, had, been, under, the, western, roman, empire, and, were, accepted, by, the, eastern, court, the, first, being, caecina, decius, maximus, basilus, in, 480, basilus, was, made, the, praetorian, prefect, of, italy, in, 483, another, traditional, position, which, continued, to, exist, under, odoacer, eleven, further, consuls, were, appointed, by, the, senate, under, odoacer, from, 480, to, 493, and, one, further, praetorian, prefect, of, italy, was, appointed, caecina, mavortius, basilius, decius, 486, 493, though, odoacer, ruled, as, a, roman, governor, would, have, and, maintained, himself, as, a, subordinate, to, the, remaining, empire, the, eastern, emperor, zeno, began, to, increasingly, see, him, as, a, rival, thus, zeno, promised, theoderic, the, great, of, the, ostrogoths, foederati, of, the, eastern, court, control, over, the, italian, peninsula, if, he, was, able, to, defeat, odoacer, theoderic, led, the, ostrogoths, across, the, julian, alps, and, into, italy, and, defeated, odoacer, in, battle, twice, in, 489, following, four, years, of, hostilities, between, them, john, the, bishop, of, ravenna, was, able, to, negotiate, a, treaty, in, 493, between, odoacer, and, theoderic, whereby, they, agreed, to, rule, ravenna, and, italy, jointly, theoderic, entered, ravenna, on, 5, march, and, odoacer, was, dead, ten, days, later, killed, by, theoderic, after, sharing, a, meal, with, him, theoderic, inherited, odoacer, s, role, as, acting, viceroy, for, italy, and, ostensibly, a, patricius, and, subject, of, the, emperor, in, constantinople, this, position, was, recognized, by, emperor, anastasius, in, 497, four, years, after, theoderic, had, defeated, odoacer, though, theodoric, acted, as, an, independent, ruler, he, meticulously, preserved, the, outward, appearance, of, his, subordinate, position, theoderic, continued, to, use, the, administrative, systems, of, odoacer, s, kingdom, essentially, those, of, the, western, roman, empire, and, administrative, positions, continued, to, be, staffed, exclusively, by, romans, the, senate, continued, to, function, as, it, always, had, and, the, laws, of, the, empire, were, recognized, as, ruling, the, roman, population, though, the, goths, were, ruled, by, their, own, traditional, laws, as, a, subordinate, theoderic, did, not, have, the, right, to, issue, his, own, laws, only, edicts, or, clarifications, the, army, and, military, offices, were, exclusively, staffed, by, the, goths, however, who, largely, settled, in, northern, italy, though, acting, as, a, subordinate, in, domestic, affairs, theodoric, acted, increasingly, independent, in, his, foreign, policies, seeking, to, counterbalance, the, influence, of, the, empire, in, the, east, theoderic, married, his, daughters, to, the, visigothic, king, alaric, ii, and, the, burgundian, prince, sigismund, his, sister, amalfrida, was, married, to, the, vandal, king, thrasamund, and, he, married, audofleda, sister, of, the, frankish, king, clovis, i, himself, through, these, alliances, and, occasional, conflicts, the, territory, controlled, by, theoderic, in, the, early, sixth, century, nearly, constituted, a, restored, western, roman, empire, ruler, of, italy, since, 493, theoderic, became, king, of, the, visigoths, in, 511, and, exerted, hegemony, over, the, vandals, in, north, africa, between, 521, and, 523, as, such, his, rule, extended, throughout, the, western, mediterranean, the, western, imperial, regalia, housed, in, constantinople, since, the, deposition, of, romulus, augustulus, in, 476, were, returned, to, ravenna, by, emperor, anastasius, in, 497, theoderic, by, now, western, emperor, in, all, but, name, could, not, however, assume, an, imperial, title, not, only, because, the, notion, of, a, separate, western, court, had, been, abolished, but, also, due, to, his, barbarian, heritage, which, like, that, of, ricimer, before, him, would, have, barred, him, from, assuming, the, throne, with, the, death, of, theodoric, in, 526, his, network, of, alliances, began, to, collapse, the, visigoths, regained, autonomy, under, king, amalaric, and, the, ostrogoths, relations, with, the, vandals, turned, increasingly, hostile, under, the, reign, of, their, new, king, athalaric, a, child, under, the, regency, of, his, mother, amalasuntha, after, the, collapse, of, theoderic, s, control, of, the, western, mediterranean, the, frankish, kingdom, rose, to, become, the, most, powerful, of, the, barbarian, kingdoms, having, taken, control, of, most, of, gaul, in, the, absence, of, roman, governance, amalasuntha, continued, the, policies, of, conciliation, between, the, goths, and, romans, supporting, the, new, eastern, emperor, justinian, i, and, allowing, him, to, use, sicily, as, a, staging, point, during, the, reconquest, of, africa, in, the, vandalic, war, with, the, death, of, athalaric, in, 534, amalasuntha, crowned, her, cousin, and, only, relative, theodahad, as, king, hoping, for, his, support, instead, amalasuntha, was, imprisoned, and, even, though, theodahad, assured, emperor, justinian, of, her, safety, she, was, executed, shortly, after, this, served, as, an, ideal, casus, belli, for, justinian, who, prepared, to, invade, and, reclaim, the, italian, peninsula, for, the, roman, empire, with, emperor, zeno, having, juridically, reunified, the, empire, into, one, imperial, court, the, remaining, eastern, roman, empire, continued, to, lay, claim, to, the, areas, previously, controlled, by, the, western, court, throughout, late, antiquity, and, the, middle, ages, though, military, campaigns, had, been, conducted, by, the, western, court, prior, to, 476, with, the, aim, of, recapturing, lost, territory, most, notably, under, majorian, the, reconquests, if, successful, at, all, were, only, momentary, it, was, as, a, result, of, the, campaigns, of, the, generals, belisarius, and, narses, on, behalf, of, the, eastern, roman, emperor, justinian, i, from, 533, to, 554, that, long, lasting, reconquests, of, roman, lands, were, witnessed, despite, also, suffering, from, barbarian, incursions, the, eastern, empire, had, survived, the, fifth, century, mostly, intact, the, western, roman, empire, less, urbanized, than, the, eastern, and, more, thinly, populated, may, have, experienced, an, economic, decline, throughout, the, late, empire, in, some, provinces, southern, italy, northern, gaul, except, for, large, towns, and, cities, and, to, some, extent, spain, and, the, danubian, areas, may, have, suffered, the, east, fared, better, economically, especially, as, emperors, such, as, constantine, the, great, and, constantius, ii, had, invested, heavily, in, the, eastern, economy, as, a, result, the, eastern, empire, could, afford, large, numbers, of, professional, soldiers, and, to, augment, them, with, mercenaries, while, the, western, roman, empire, could, not, afford, this, to, the, same, extent, even, after, major, defeats, the, east, could, although, not, without, difficulties, buy, off, its, enemies, with, a, ransom, or, protection, money, numbering, more, than, 300, 000, soldiers, the, eastern, roman, army, of, justinian, i, was, among, the, most, powerful, in, the, world, unlike, the, visigoths, and, ostrogoths, the, vandals, in, africa, minted, their, own, coinage, and, were, both, de, facto, and, de, jure, independent, often, being, enemies, of, both, the, western, and, eastern, roman, empires, with, the, pro, roman, vandal, king, hilderic, having, been, deposed, by, gelimer, in, 530, justinian, prepared, an, expedition, led, by, belisarius, it, swiftly, retook, north, africa, between, june, 533, and, march, 534, returning, the, wealthy, province, to, roman, rule, following, the, reconquest, justinian, swiftly, reintroduced, the, roman, administrations, of, the, province, establishing, a, new, praetorian, prefecture, of, africa, and, taking, measures, to, decrease, vandal, influence, eventually, leading, to, the, complete, disappearance, of, the, vandalic, people, following, the, execution, of, the, pro, roman, ostrogoth, queen, amalasuntha, and, the, refusal, of, ostrogoth, king, theodahad, to, renounce, his, control, of, italy, justinian, ordered, the, expedition, to, move, on, to, reconquer, italy, ancient, heartland, of, the, empire, from, 534, to, 540, the, roman, forces, campaigned, in, italy, and, captured, ravenna, the, ostrogothic, and, formerly, western, roman, capital, in, 540, the, gothic, resistance, revived, under, king, totila, in, 541, they, were, finally, defeated, following, campaigns, by, the, roman, general, narses, who, also, repelled, invasions, into, italy, by, the, franks, and, alemanni, though, some, cities, in, northern, italy, continued, to, hold, out, until, the, 560s, justinian, promulgated, the, pragmatic, sanction, to, reorganize, the, governance, of, italy, and, the, province, was, returned, to, roman, rule, the, end, of, the, conflict, saw, italy, devastated, and, considerably, depopulated, which, combined, with, the, disastrous, effects, of, the, plague, of, justinian, made, it, difficult, to, retain, over, the, following, centuries, at, the, time, of, the, collapse, of, the, western, empire, in, 476, 480, the, visigoths, controlled, large, areas, of, southern, gaul, as, well, as, a, majority, of, hispania, their, increased, domain, had, been, partly, conquered, and, partly, awarded, to, them, by, the, western, emperor, avitus, in, the, 450s, 60s, justinian, undertook, some, limited, campaigns, against, them, recovering, portions, of, the, southern, coast, of, the, iberian, peninsula, here, the, province, of, spania, would, last, until, the, 620s, when, the, visigoths, under, king, suintila, reconquered, the, south, coast, these, regions, remained, under, roman, control, throughout, the, reign, of, justinian, three, years, after, his, death, the, lombards, invaded, italy, the, lombards, conquered, large, parts, of, the, devastated, peninsula, in, the, late, 500s, establishing, the, lombard, kingdom, they, were, in, constant, conflict, with, the, exarchate, of, ravenna, a, polity, established, to, replace, the, old, praetorian, prefecture, of, italy, and, enforce, roman, rule, in, italy, the, wealthiest, parts, of, the, province, including, the, cities, of, rome, and, ravenna, remained, securely, in, roman, hands, under, the, exarchate, throughout, the, seventh, century, although, other, eastern, emperors, occasionally, attempted, to, campaign, in, the, west, none, were, as, successful, as, justinian, after, 600, events, conspired, to, drive, the, western, provinces, out, of, constantinople, s, control, with, imperial, attention, focused, on, the, pressing, issues, of, war, with, sasanian, persia, and, then, the, rise, of, islam, for, a, while, the, west, remained, important, with, emperor, constans, ii, ruling, from, syracuse, in, sicily, a, roman, empire, that, still, stretched, from, north, africa, to, the, caucasus, in, the, 660s, thereafter, imperial, attention, declined, with, constantinople, itself, being, besieged, in, the, 670s, renewed, war, with, the, arabs, in, the, 680s, and, then, a, period, of, chaos, between, 695, and, 717, during, which, time, africa, was, finally, lost, once, and, for, all, being, conquered, by, the, umayyad, caliphate, through, reforms, and, military, campaigns, emperor, leo, iii, attempted, to, restore, order, in, the, empire, but, his, doctrinal, reforms, known, as, the, iconoclastic, controversy, were, extremely, unpopular, in, the, west, and, were, condemned, by, pope, gregory, iii, the, roman, empire, was, not, the, only, christian, nation, affected, by, the, islamic, conquests, the, visigothic, kingdom, finally, fell, to, the, umayyad, caliphate, in, the, 720s, the, kingdom, of, asturias, was, founded, by, pelagius, of, asturias, around, the, same, time, and, was, the, first, christian, realm, to, be, established, in, iberia, following, the, defeat, of, the, visigoths, asturias, would, be, transformed, into, the, kingdom, of, le, n, in, 924, which, would, develop, into, the, predecessors, of, modern, day, spain, the, religious, disagreements, between, rome, and, constantinople, eventually, led, to, the, breakdown, in, imperial, rule, over, rome, itself, and, the, gradual, transition, of, the, exarchate, of, ravenna, into, the, independent, papal, states, led, by, the, pope, in, an, attempt, to, gain, support, against, the, lombards, the, pope, called, for, aid, from, the, frankish, kingdom, instead, of, the, eastern, empire, eventually, crowning, the, frankish, king, charlemagne, as, roman, emperor, in, ad, 800, though, this, coronation, was, strongly, opposed, by, the, eastern, empire, there, was, little, they, could, do, as, their, influence, in, western, europe, decreased, after, a, series, of, small, wars, in, the, 810s, emperor, michael, i, recognized, charlemagne, as, an, emperor, he, refused, to, recognize, him, as, a, roman, emperor, a, title, which, michael, reserved, for, himself, and, his, successors, instead, recognizing, him, as, the, slightly, less, prestigious, emperor, of, the, franks, imperial, rule, continued, in, sicily, throughout, the, eighth, century, with, the, island, slowly, being, overrun, by, the, arabs, during, the, course, of, the, ninth, century, in, italy, a, few, strongholds, in, calabria, provided, a, base, for, a, later, modest, imperial, expansion, which, reached, its, peak, in, the, early, eleventh, century, with, most, of, southern, italy, under, roman, rule, of, a, sort, this, however, was, undone, by, further, civil, wars, in, the, empire, and, the, slow, conquest, of, the, region, by, the, empire, s, former, mercenaries, the, normans, who, finally, put, an, end, to, imperial, rule, in, western, europe, in, 1071, with, the, conquest, of, bari, the, last, emperor, to, attempt, reconquests, in, the, west, was, manuel, i, komnenos, who, invaded, southern, italy, during, a, war, with, the, norman, kingdom, of, sicily, in, the, 1150s, the, city, of, bari, willingly, opened, its, gates, to, the, emperor, and, after, successes, in, taking, other, cities, in, the, region, manuel, dreamed, of, a, restored, roman, empire, and, a, union, between, the, churches, of, rome, and, constantinople, separated, since, the, schism, of, 1054, despite, initial, successes, and, papal, support, the, campaign, was, unsuccessful, and, manuel, was, forced, to, return, east, as, the, western, roman, empire, crumbled, the, new, germanic, rulers, who, conquered, its, constituent, provinces, maintained, most, roman, laws, and, traditions, many, of, the, invading, germanic, tribes, were, already, christianized, although, most, were, followers, of, arianism, they, quickly, changed, their, adherence, to, the, state, church, of, the, roman, empire, this, helped, cement, the, loyalty, of, the, local, roman, populations, as, well, as, the, support, of, the, powerful, bishop, of, rome, although, they, initially, continued, to, recognize, indigenous, tribal, laws, they, were, more, influenced, by, roman, law, and, gradually, incorporated, it, roman, law, particularly, the, corpus, juris, civilis, collected, on, the, orders, of, justinian, i, is, the, basis, of, modern, civil, law, in, contrast, common, law, is, based, on, germanic, anglo, saxon, law, civil, law, is, by, far, the, most, widespread, system, of, law, in, the, world, in, force, in, some, form, in, about, 150, countries, latin, as, a, language, did, not, disappear, vulgar, latin, combined, with, neighboring, germanic, and, celtic, languages, giving, rise, to, modern, romance, languages, such, as, italian, french, spanish, portuguese, romanian, and, a, large, number, of, minor, languages, and, dialects, today, more, than, 900, million, people, are, native, speakers, of, romance, languages, worldwide, in, addition, many, romance, languages, are, used, as, lingua, francas, by, non, native, speakers, latin, also, influenced, germanic, languages, such, as, english, and, german, it, survives, in, a, purer, form, as, the, language, of, the, catholic, church, the, catholic, mass, was, spoken, exclusively, in, latin, until, 1969, as, such, it, was, also, used, as, a, lingua, franca, by, ecclesiasticals, it, remained, the, language, of, medicine, law, and, diplomacy, as, well, as, of, intellectuals, and, scholarship, well, into, the, 18th, century, since, then, the, use, of, latin, has, declined, with, the, growth, of, other, lingua, francas, especially, english, and, french, the, latin, alphabet, was, expanded, due, to, the, split, of, i, into, i, and, j, and, of, v, into, u, v, and, in, places, especially, germanic, languages, and, polish, w, latin, script, is, the, basis, for, the, largest, number, of, alphabets, of, any, writing, system, and, is, the, most, widely, adopted, writing, system, in, the, world, roman, numerals, continue, to, be, used, in, some, fields, and, situations, though, they, have, largely, been, replaced, by, arabic, numerals, a, very, visible, legacy, of, the, western, roman, empire, is, the, catholic, church, church, institutions, slowly, began, to, replace, roman, ones, in, the, west, even, helping, to, negotiate, the, safety, of, rome, during, the, late, 5th, century, as, rome, was, invaded, by, germanic, tribes, many, assimilated, and, by, the, middle, of, the, medieval, period, c, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, the, central, western, and, northern, parts, of, europe, had, been, largely, converted, to, roman, catholicism, and, acknowledged, the, pope, as, the, vicar, of, christ, the, first, of, the, barbarian, kings, to, convert, to, the, church, of, rome, was, clovis, i, of, the, franks, other, kingdoms, such, as, the, visigoths, later, followed, suit, to, garner, favor, with, the, papacy, when, pope, leo, iii, crowned, charlemagne, as, roman, emperor, in, 800, he, both, severed, ties, with, the, outraged, eastern, empire, and, established, the, precedent, that, no, man, in, western, europe, would, be, emperor, without, a, papal, coronation, although, the, power, the, pope, wielded, changed, significantly, throughout, the, subsequent, periods, the, office, itself, has, remained, as, the, head, of, the, catholic, church, and, the, head, of, state, of, the, vatican, city, the, pope, has, consistently, held, the, title, of, pontifex, maximus, since, before, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, and, retains, it, to, this, day, this, title, formerly, used, by, the, high, priest, of, the, roman, polytheistic, religion, one, of, whom, was, julius, caesar, the, roman, senate, survived, the, initial, collapse, of, the, western, roman, empire, its, authority, increased, under, the, rule, of, odoacer, and, later, the, ostrogoths, evident, by, the, senate, in, 498, managing, to, install, symmachus, as, pope, despite, both, theodoric, of, italy, and, emperor, anastasius, supporting, another, candidate, laurentius, exactly, when, the, senate, disappeared, is, unclear, but, the, institution, is, known, to, have, survived, at, least, into, the, 6th, century, inasmuch, as, gifts, from, the, senate, were, received, by, emperor, tiberius, ii, in, 578, and, 580, the, traditional, senate, building, curia, julia, was, rebuilt, into, a, church, under, pope, honorius, i, in, 630, probably, with, permission, from, the, eastern, emperor, heraclius, marcellinus, comes, a, sixth, century, eastern, roman, historian, and, a, courtier, of, justinian, i, mentions, the, western, roman, empire, in, his, chronicle, which, primarily, covers, the, eastern, roman, empire, from, 379, to, 534, in, the, chronicle, it, is, clear, that, marcellinus, made, a, clear, divide, between, east, and, west, with, mentions, of, a, geographical, east, oriens, and, west, occidens, and, of, an, imperial, east, orientale, imperium, and, orientale, respublica, and, an, imperial, west, occidentalie, imperium, occidentale, regnum, occidentalis, respublica, hesperium, regnum, hesperium, imperium, and, principatum, occidentis, furthermore, marcellinus, specifically, designates, some, emperors, and, consuls, as, being, eastern, orientalibus, principibus, and, orientalium, consulum, respectively, the, term, hesperium, imperium, translating, to, western, empire, has, sometimes, been, applied, to, the, western, roman, empire, by, modern, historians, as, well, though, marcellinus, does, not, refer, to, the, empire, as, a, whole, after, 395, only, to, its, separate, parts, he, clearly, identifies, the, term, roman, as, applying, to, the, empire, as, a, whole, when, using, terms, such, as, us, our, generals, and, our, emperor, marcellinus, distinguished, both, divisions, of, the, empire, from, outside, foes, such, as, the, sasanian, persians, and, the, huns, this, view, is, consistent, with, the, view, that, contemporary, romans, of, the, 4th, and, 5th, centuries, continued, to, consider, the, empire, as, a, single, unit, although, more, often, than, not, with, two, rulers, instead, of, one, the, first, time, the, empire, was, divided, geographically, was, during, the, reign, of, diocletian, but, there, was, precedent, for, multiple, emperors, before, diocletian, and, the, tetrarchy, there, had, been, a, number, of, periods, where, there, were, co, emperors, such, as, with, caracalla, and, geta, in, 210, 211, who, inherited, the, imperial, throne, from, their, father, septimius, severus, but, caracalla, ruled, alone, after, the, murder, of, his, brother, the, positions, of, eastern, and, western, augustus, established, under, emperor, diocletian, in, 286, as, the, tetrarchy, had, been, abolished, by, emperor, zeno, in, 480, following, the, loss, of, direct, control, over, the, western, territories, declaring, himself, the, sole, augustus, zeno, only, exercised, true, control, over, the, largely, intact, eastern, empire, and, over, italy, as, the, nominal, overlord, of, odoacer, the, reconquests, under, justinian, i, would, bring, back, large, formerly, western, roman, territories, into, imperial, control, and, with, them, the, empire, would, begin, to, face, the, same, problems, it, had, faced, under, previous, periods, prior, to, the, tetrarchy, when, there, had, been, only, one, ruler, shortly, after, the, reconquest, of, north, africa, a, usurper, stotzas, appeared, in, the, province, though, he, was, quickly, defeated, as, such, the, idea, of, dividing, the, empire, into, two, courts, out, of, administrative, necessity, would, see, a, limited, revival, during, the, period, that, the, eastern, empire, controlled, large, parts, of, the, former, west, both, by, courtiers, in, the, east, and, enemies, in, the, west, the, earliest, attempt, at, crowning, a, new, western, emperor, after, the, abolition, of, the, title, occurred, already, during, the, gothic, wars, under, justinian, belisarius, an, accomplished, general, who, had, already, successfully, campaigned, to, restore, roman, control, over, north, africa, and, large, parts, of, italy, including, rome, itself, was, offered, the, position, of, western, roman, emperor, by, the, ostrogoths, during, his, siege, of, ravenna, the, ostrogothic, and, previously, western, roman, capital, in, 540, the, ostrogoths, desperate, to, avoid, losing, their, control, of, italy, offered, the, title, and, their, fealty, to, belisarius, as, western, augustus, justinian, had, expected, to, rule, over, a, restored, roman, empire, alone, with, the, codex, justinianeus, explicitly, designating, the, new, praetorian, prefect, of, africa, as, the, subject, of, justinian, in, constantinople, belisarius, loyal, to, justinian, feigned, acceptance, of, the, title, to, enter, the, city, whereupon, he, immediately, relinquished, it, despite, belisarius, relinquishing, the, title, the, offer, had, made, justinian, suspicious, and, belisarius, was, ordered, to, return, east, at, the, end, of, emperor, tiberius, ii, s, reign, in, 582, the, eastern, roman, empire, retained, control, over, relatively, large, parts, of, the, regions, reconquered, under, justinian, tiberius, chose, two, caesares, the, general, maurice, and, the, governor, germanus, and, married, his, two, daughters, to, them, germanus, had, clear, connections, to, the, western, provinces, and, maurice, to, the, eastern, provinces, it, is, possible, that, tiberius, was, planning, to, divide, the, empire, into, western, and, eastern, administrative, units, once, more, if, so, the, plan, was, never, realized, at, the, death, of, tiberius, maurice, inherited, the, entire, empire, as, germanus, had, refused, the, throne, maurice, established, a, new, type, of, administrative, unit, the, exarchate, and, organized, the, remaining, western, territories, under, his, control, into, the, exarchate, of, ravenna, and, the, exarchate, of, africa, in, addition, to, remaining, as, a, concept, for, an, administrative, unit, in, the, remaining, empire, the, ideal, of, the, roman, empire, as, a, mighty, christian, empire, with, a, single, ruler, further, continued, to, appeal, to, many, powerful, rulers, in, western, europe, with, the, papal, coronation, of, charlemagne, as, emperor, of, the, romans, in, ad, 800, his, realm, was, explicitly, proclaimed, as, a, restoration, of, the, roman, empire, in, western, europe, under, the, concept, of, translatio, imperii, though, the, carolingian, empire, collapsed, in, 888, and, berengar, the, last, emperor, claiming, succession, from, charlemagne, died, in, 924, the, concept, of, a, papacy, and, germanic, based, roman, empire, in, the, west, would, resurface, in, the, form, of, the, holy, roman, empire, in, 962, the, holy, roman, emperors, would, uphold, the, notion, that, they, had, inherited, the, supreme, power, and, prestige, of, the, roman, emperors, of, old, until, the, dissolution, of, the, holy, roman, empire, in, 1806, charlemagne, and, the, subsequent, holy, roman, emperors, were, not, and, did, not, claim, to, be, rulers, of, a, restored, western, roman, empire, pope, leo, iii, and, contemporary, historians, were, fully, aware, that, the, notion, of, a, separate, western, court, had, been, abolished, over, three, centuries, prior, and, considered, the, roman, empire, to, be, one, and, indivisible, the, ruler, of, the, roman, empire, at, the, time, of, charlemagne, s, coronation, was, irene, of, athens, the, mother, of, emperor, constantine, vi, who, she, had, deposed, leo, iii, considered, irene, to, be, a, usurper, and, illegitimate, to, rule, due, to, her, gender, and, as, such, considered, the, imperial, throne, to, be, vacant, thus, charlemagne, was, not, crowned, as, the, ruler, of, the, western, roman, empire, and, successor, to, romulus, augustulus, but, rather, as, the, successor, of, constantine, vi, and, as, sole, roman, emperor, irene, was, deposed, and, replaced, by, emperor, nikephoros, soon, after, and, the, eastern, empire, refused, to, recognize, the, imperial, title, of, charlemagne, following, several, wars, in, the, 810s, emperor, michael, i, rangabe, eventually, recognized, charlemagne, as, an, emperor, but, as, the, slightly, humiliating, emperor, of, the, franks, rather, than, roman, emperor, a, title, he, reserved, for, himself, for, centuries, to, come, the, revived, western, court, and, the, eastern, court, in, direct, succession, to, the, roman, emperors, of, old, would, make, competing, claims, to, be, rulers, of, the, whole, roman, empire, with, the, eastern, empire, terming, the, holy, roman, empire, as, an, empire, of, the, franks, the, term, empire, of, the, greeks, was, popularized, in, the, frankish, court, as, a, way, to, refer, to, the, empire, centered, in, constantinople, following, the, end, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, after, the, fall, of, constantinople, in, 1453, and, the, dissolution, of, the, holy, roman, empire, in, 1806, the, title, of, emperor, became, widespread, among, european, monarchs, the, austrian, empire, laid, claim, to, be, the, heir, of, the, holy, roman, empire, as, austria, s, habsburgs, attempted, to, unite, germany, under, their, rule, the, german, empire, established, in, 1871, also, claimed, to, be, a, successor, of, rome, through, the, lineage, of, the, holy, roman, empire, both, of, these, empires, used, the, imperial, title, kaiser, derived, from, the, latin, word, caesar, the, german, word, for, emperor, the, german, empire, and, austria, hungary, successor, of, the, austrian, empire, would, both, fall, in, the, aftermath, of, the, first,
