oise, and, the, garonne, gallia, celtica, according, to, julius, caesar, on, the, lower, garonne, the, people, spoke, aquitanian, a, pre, indo, european, language, related, to, or, a, direct,

great, navigators, such, as, pytheas, were, born, in, marseille, the, celts, themselves, often, fought, with, aquitanians, and, germans, and, a, gaulish, war, band, led, by, brennus, invaded, rome, c, 393, or, 388, bc, following, the, battle, of, the, allia, however, the, tribal, society, of, the, gauls, did, not, change, fast, enough, for, the, centralized, roman, state, who, would, learn, to,

his, side, at, cannae, it, was, this, gaulish, participation, that, caused, provence, to, be, annexed, in, 122, bc, by, the, roman, republic, later, the, consul, of, gaul, julius, caesar, conquered, all, of, gaul, despite, gaulish, opposition, led, by, vercingetorix, the, gauls, succumbed, to, the, roman, onslaught, the, gauls, had, some, success, at, first, at, gergovia, but, were, ultimately,

formalize, the, existence, of, cularo, grenoble, gaul, was, divided, into, several, different, provinces, the, romans, displaced, populations, to, prevent, local, identities, from, becoming, a, threat, to, roman, control, thus, many, celts, were, displaced, in, aquitania, or, were, enslaved, and, moved, out, of, gaul, there, was, a, strong, cultural, evolution, in, gaul, under, the, roman, empire, the, most, obvious, one, being, the, replacement, of, the, gaulish, language, by, vulgar, latin, it, has, been, argued, the, similarities, between, the, gaulish, and, latin, languages, favoured, the, transition, gaul, remained, under, roman, control, for, centuries, and, celtic, culture, was, then, gradually, replaced, by, gallo, roman, culture, the, gauls, became, better, integrated, with, the, empire, with, the, passage, of, time, for, instance, generals, marcus, antonius, primus, and, gnaeus, julius, agricola, were, both, born, in, gaul, as, were, emperors, claudius, and, caracalla, emperor, antoninus, pius, also, came, from, a, gaulish, family, in, the, decade, following, valerian, s, capture, by, the, persians, in, 260, postumus, established, a, short, lived, gallic, empire, which, included, the, iberian, peninsula, and, britannia, in, addition, to, gaul, itself, germanic, tribes, the, franks, and, the, alamanni, entered, gaul, at, this, time, the, gallic, empire, ended, with, emperor, aurelian, s, victory, at, ch, lons, in, 274, a, migration, of, celts, occurred, in, the, 4th, century, in, armorica, they, were, led, by, the, legendary, king, conan, meriadoc, and, came, from, britain, they, spoke, the, now, extinct, british, language, which, evolved, into, the, breton, cornish, and, welsh, languages, in, 418, the, aquitanian, province, was, given, to, the, goths, in, exchange, for, their, support, against, the, vandals, those, same, goths, had, sacked, rome, in, 410, and, established, a, capital, in, toulouse, the, roman, empire, had, difficulty, integrating, all, the, barbarian, newcomers, with, whom, foederati, treaties, were, concluded, within, the, empire, and, generals, as, flavius, a, tius, had, to, use, these, tribes, against, each, other, in, order, to, maintain, some, roman, control, he, first, used, the, huns, against, the, burgundians, and, these, mercenaries, destroyed, worms, killed, king, gunther, and, pushed, the, burgundians, westward, the, burgundians, were, resettled, by, a, tius, near, lugdunum, in, 443, the, huns, united, by, attila, became, a, greater, threat, and, a, tius, used, the, visigoths, against, the, huns, the, conflict, climaxed, in, 451, at, the, battle, of, ch, lons, in, which, the, romans, and, goths, defeated, attila, the, roman, empire, was, on, the, verge, of, collapsing, aquitania, was, definitely, abandoned, to, the, visigoths, who, would, soon, conquer, a, significant, part, of, southern, gaul, as, well, as, most, of, the, iberian, peninsula, the, burgundians, claimed, their, own, kingdom, and, northern, gaul, was, practically, abandoned, to, the, franks, aside, from, the, germanic, peoples, the, vascones, entered, wasconia, from, the, pyrenees, and, the, bretons, formed, three, kingdoms, in, armorica, domnonia, cornouaille, and, bro, rec, in, 486, clovis, i, leader, of, the, salian, franks, defeated, syagrius, at, soissons, and, subsequently, united, most, of, northern, and, central, gaul, under, his, rule, clovis, then, recorded, a, succession, of, victories, against, other, germanic, tribes, such, as, the, alamanni, at, tolbiac, in, 496, pagan, clovis, adopted, catholicism, this, gave, him, greater, legitimacy, and, power, over, his, christian, subjects, and, granted, him, clerical, support, against, the, arian, visigoths, he, defeated, alaric, ii, at, vouill, in, 507, and, annexed, aquitaine, and, thus, toulouse, into, his, frankish, kingdom, the, goths, retired, to, toledo, in, what, would, become, spain, clovis, made, paris, his, capital, and, established, the, merovingian, dynasty, but, his, kingdom, would, not, survive, his, death, in, 511, under, frankish, inheritance, traditions, all, sons, inherit, part, of, the, land, so, four, kingdoms, emerged, centered, on, paris, orl, ans, soissons, and, rheims, over, time, the, borders, and, numbers, of, frankish, kingdoms, were, fluid, and, changed, frequently, also, during, this, time, the, mayors, of, the, palace, originally, the, chief, advisor, to, the, kings, would, become, the, real, power, in, the, frankish, lands, the, merovingian, kings, themselves, would, be, reduced, to, little, more, than, figureheads, by, this, time, muslims, had, conquered, hispania, and, septimania, became, part, of, the, al, andalus, which, were, threatening, the, frankish, kingdoms, duke, odo, the, great, defeated, a, major, invading, force, at, toulouse, in, 721, but, failed, to, repel, a, raiding, party, in, 732, the, mayor, of, the, palace, charles, martel, defeated, that, raiding, party, at, the, battle, of, tours, and, earned, respect, and, power, within, the, frankish, kingdom, the, assumption, of, the, crown, in, 751, by, pepin, the, short, son, of, charles, martel, established, the, carolingian, dynasty, as, the, kings, of, the, franks, carolingian, power, reached, its, fullest, extent, under, pepin, s, son, charlemagne, in, 771, charlemagne, reunited, the, frankish, domains, after, a, further, period, of, division, subsequently, conquering, the, lombards, under, desiderius, in, what, is, now, northern, italy, 774, incorporating, bavaria, 788, into, his, realm, defeating, the, avars, of, the, danubian, plain, 796, advancing, the, frontier, with, al, andalus, as, far, south, as, barcelona, 801, and, subjugating, lower, saxony, after, a, prolonged, campaign, 804, in, recognition, of, his, successes, and, his, political, support, for, the, papacy, charlemagne, was, crowned, emperor, of, the, romans, or, roman, emperor, in, the, west, by, pope, leo, iii, in, 800, charlemagne, s, son, louis, the, pious, emperor, 814, 840, kept, the, empire, united, however, this, carolingian, empire, would, not, survive, louis, i, s, death, two, of, his, sons, charles, the, bald, and, louis, the, german, swore, allegiance, to, each, other, against, their, brother, lothair, i, in, the, oaths, of, strasbourg, and, the, empire, was, divided, among, louis, s, three, sons, treaty, of, verdun, 843, after, a, last, brief, reunification, 884, 887, the, imperial, title, ceased, to, be, held, in, the, western, realm, which, was, to, form, the, basis, of, the, future, french, kingdom, the, eastern, realm, which, would, become, germany, elected, the, saxon, dynasty, of, henry, the, fowler, under, the, carolingians, the, kingdom, was, ravaged, by, viking, raiders, in, this, struggle, some, important, figures, such, as, count, odo, of, paris, and, his, brother, king, robert, rose, to, fame, and, became, kings, this, emerging, dynasty, whose, members, were, called, the, robertines, were, the, predecessors, of, the, capetian, dynasty, led, by, rollo, some, vikings, had, settled, in, normandy, and, were, granted, the, land, first, as, counts, and, then, as, dukes, by, king, charles, the, simple, in, order, to, protect, the, land, from, other, raiders, the, people, that, emerged, from, the, interactions, between, the, new, viking, aristocracy, and, the, already, mixed, franks, and, gallo, romans, became, known, as, the, normans, france, was, a, very, decentralised, state, during, the, middle, ages, the, authority, of, the, king, was, more, religious, than, administrative, the, 11th, century, in, france, marked, the, apogee, of, princely, power, at, the, expense, of, the, king, when, states, like, normandy, flanders, or, languedoc, enjoyed, a, local, authority, comparable, to, kingdoms, in, all, but, name, the, capetians, as, they, were, descended, from, the, robertians, were, formerly, powerful, princes, themselves, who, had, successfully, unseated, the, weak, and, unfortunate, carolingian, kings, the, capetians, in, a, way, held, a, dual, status, of, king, and, prince, as, king, they, held, the, crown, of, charlemagne, and, as, count, of, paris, they, held, their, personal, fiefdom, best, known, as, le, de, france, some, of, the, king, s, vassals, would, grow, sufficiently, powerful, that, they, would, become, some, of, the, strongest, rulers, of, western, europe, the, normans, the, plantagenets, the, lusignans, the, hautevilles, the, ramnulfids, and, the, house, of, toulouse, successfully, carved, lands, outside, france, for, themselves, the, most, important, of, these, conquests, for, french, history, was, the, norman, conquest, by, william, the, conqueror, an, important, part, of, the, french, aristocracy, also, involved, itself, in, the, crusades, and, french, knights, founded, and, ruled, the, crusader, states, the, french, were, also,

and, ottonian, relationships, the, reign, of, robert, ii, was, quite, important, because, it, involved, the, peace, and, truce, of, god, beginning, in, 989, and, the, cluniac, reforms, under, king, philip, i, the, kingdom, enjoyed, a, modest, recovery, during, his, extraordinarily, long, reign, 1060, 1108, his, reign, also, saw, the, launch, of, the, first, crusade, to, regain, the, holy, land,

son, of, henry, ii, richard, lionheart, and, together, they, launched, a, decisive, attack, on, henry, s, home, of, chinon, and, removed, him, from, power, richard, replaced, his, father, as, king, of, england, afterward, the, two, kings, then, went, crusading, during, the, third, crusade, however, their, alliance, and, friendship, broke, down, during, the, crusade, john, lackland, richard, s, successor, refused, to, come, to, the, french, court, for, a, trial, against, the, lusignans, and, as, louis, vi, had, done, often, to, his, rebellious, vassals, philip, ii, confiscated, john, s, possessions, in, france, john, s, defeat, was, swift, and, his, attempts, to, reconquer, his, french, possession, at, the, decisive, battle, of, bouvines, 1214, resulted, in, complete, failure,

retained, much, of, his, lands, for, life, but, his, daughter, married, to, count, alfonso, of, poitou, produced, him, no, heir, and, so, the, county, of, toulouse, went, to, the, king, of, france, king, henry, iii, of, england, had, not, yet, recognized, the, capetian, overlordship, over, aquitaine, and, still, hoped, to, recover, normandy, and, anjou, and, reform, the, angevin, empire, he, landed, in, 1230, at, saint, malo, with, a, massive, force, this, evolved, into, the, saintonge, war, 1242, ultimately, henry, iii, was, defeated, and, had, to, recognise, louis, ix, s, overlordship, although, the, king, of, france, did, not, seize, aquitaine, louis, ix, was, now, the, most, important, landowner, of, france, there, were, some, opposition, to, his, rule, in, normandy, yet, it, proved, remarkably, easy, to, rule, especially, compared, to, the, county, of, toulouse, which, had, been, brutally, conquered, the, conseil, du, roi, which, would, evolve, into, the, parlement, was, founded, in, these, times, after, his, conflict, with, king, henry, iii, of, england, louis, established, a, cordial, relation, with, the, plantagenet, king, the, kingdom, was, involved, in, two, crusades, under, louis, the, seventh, crusade, and, the, eighth, crusade, both, proved, to, be, complete, failures, for, the, french, king, philip, iii, became, king, when, saint, louis, died, in, 1270, during, the, eighth, crusade, philip, iii, was, called, the, bold, on, the, basis, of, his, abilities, in, combat, and, on, horseback, and, not, because, of, his, character, or, ruling, abilities, philip, iii, took, part, in, another, crusading, disaster, the, aragonese, crusade, which, cost, him, his, life, in, 1285, more, administrative, reforms, were, made, by, philip, iv, also, called, philip, the, fair, reigned, 1285, 1314, this, king, was, responsible, for, the, end, of, the, knights, templar, signed, the, auld, alliance, and, established, the, parlement, of, paris, philip, iv, was, so, powerful, that, he, could, name, popes, and, emperors, unlike, the, early, capetians, the, papacy, was, moved, to, avignon, and, all, the, contemporary, popes, were, french, such, as, philip, iv, s, puppet, bertrand, de, goth, pope, clement, v, the, tensions, between, the, houses, of, plantagenet, and, capet, climaxed, during, the, so, called, hundred, years, war, actually, several, distinct, wars, over, the, period, 1337, to, 1453, when, the, plantagenets, claimed, the, throne, of, france, from, the, valois, this, was, also, the, time, of, the, black, death, as, well, as, several, devastating, civil, wars, in, 1420, by, the, treaty, of, troyes, henry, v, was, made, heir, to, charles, vi, henry, v, failed, to, outlive, charles, so, it, was, henry, vi, of, england, and, france, who, consolidated, the, dual, monarchy, of, england, and, france, it, has, been, argued, that, the, difficult, conditions, the, french, population, suffered, during, the, hundred, years, war, awakened, french, nationalism, a, nationalism, represented, by, joan, of, arc, 1412, 1431, although, this, is, debatable, the, hundred, years, war, is, remembered, more, as, a, franco, english, war, than, as, a, succession, of, feudal, struggles, during, this, war, france, evolved, politically, and, militarily, although, a, franco, scottish, army, was, successful, at, the, battle, of, baug, 1421, the, humiliating, defeats, of, poitiers, 1356, and, agincourt, 1415, forced, the, french, nobility, to, realise, they, could, not, stand, just, as, armoured, knights, without, an, organised, army, charles, vii, reigned, 1422, 61, established, the, first, french, standing, army, the, compagnies, d, ordonnance, and, defeated, the, plantagenets, once, at, patay, 1429, and, again, using, cannons, at, formigny, 1450, the, battle, of, castillon, 1453, was, the, last, engagement, of, this, war, calais, and, the, channel, islands, remained, ruled, by, the, plantagenets, france, s,

countries, grew, faster, political, power, was, widely, dispersed, the, law, courts, parlements, were, powerful, however, the, king, had, only, about, 10, 000, officials, in, royal, service, very, few, indeed, for, such, a, large, country, and, with, very, slow, internal, communications, over, an, inadequate, road, system, travel, was, usually, faster, by, ocean, ship, or, river, boat, the, different, estates, of, the, realm, the, clergy, the, nobility, and, commoners, occasionally, met, together, in, the, estates, general, but, in, practice, the, estates, general, had, no, power, for, it, could, petition, the, king, but, could, not, pass, laws, the, catholic, church, controlled, about, 40, of, the, wealth, the, king, not, the, pope, nominated, bishops, but, typically, had, to, negotiate, with, noble, families, that, had, close, ties, to, local, monasteries, and, church, establishments, the, nobility, came, second, in, terms, of, wealth, but, there, was, no, unity, each, noble, had, his, own, lands, his, own, network, of, regional, connections, and, his, own, military, force, the, cities, had, a, quasi, independent, status, and, were, largely, controlled, by, the, leading, merchants, and, guilds, peasants, made, up, the, vast, majority, of, population, who, in, many, cases, had, well, established, rights, that, the, authorities, had, to, respect, in, the, 17th, century, peasants, had, ties, to, the, market, economy, provided, much, of, the, capital, investment, necessary, for, agricultural, growth, and, frequently, moved, from, village, to, village, or, town, although, most, peasants, in, france, spoke, local, dialects, an, official, language, emerged, in, paris, and, the, french, language, became, the, preferred, language, of, europe, s, aristocracy, and, the, lingua, franca, of, diplomacy, and, international, relations, holy, roman, emperor, charles, v, quipped, i, speak, spanish, to, god, italian, to, women, french, to, men, and,

medici, who, became, a, central, figure, in, the, early, years, of, the, wars, of, religion, she, is, often, blamed, for, the, st, bartholomew, s, day, massacre, of, 1572, when, thousands, of, huguenots, were, murdered, in, paris, and, the, provinces, of, france, the, wars, of, religion, culminated, in, the, war, of, the, three, henrys, 1584, 98, at, the, height, of, which, bodyguards, of,

when, in, 1620, the, huguenots, proclaimed, a, constitution, for, the, republic, of, the, reformed, churches, of, france, the, chief, minister, cardinal, richelieu, invoked, the, entire, powers, of, the, state, to, stop, it, religious, conflicts, therefore, resumed, under, louis, xiii, when, richelieu, forced, protestants, to, disarm, their, army, and, fortresses, this, conflict, ended, in, the, siege, of, la, rochelle, 1627, 28, in, which, protestants, and, their, english, supporters, were, defeated, the, following, peace, of, alais, 1629, confirmed, religious, freedom, yet, dismantled, the,

the, protestants, he, joined, this, war, on, their, side, in, 1636, because, it, was, in, the, national, interest, imperial, habsburg, forces, invaded, france, ravaged, champagne, and, nearly, threatened, paris, richelieu, died, in, 1642, and, was, succeeded, by, cardinal, mazarin, while, louis, xiii, died, one, year, later, and, was, succeeded, by, louis, xiv, france, was, served, by, some, very, efficient, commanders, such, as, louis, ii, de, bourbon, prince, de, cond, and, henri, de, la, tour, d, auvergne, vicomte, de, turenne, the, french, forces, won, a, decisive, victory, at, rocroi, 1643, and, the, spanish, army, was, decimated, the, tercio, was, broken, the, truce, of, ulm, 1647, and, the, peace, of, westphalia, 1648, brought, an, end, to, the, war, france, was, hit, by, civil, unrest, known, as, the, fronde, which, in, turn, evolved, into, the, franco, spanish, war, in, 1653, louis, ii, de, bourbon, joined, the, spanish, army, this, time, but, suffered, a, severe, defeat, at, dunkirk, 1658, by, henry, de, la, tour, d, auvergne, the, terms, for, the, peace, inflicted, upon, the, spanish, kingdoms, in, the, treaty, of, the, pyrenees, 1659, were, harsh, as, france, annexed, northern, catalonia, during, the, 16th, century, the, king, began, to, claim, north, american, territories, and, established, several, colonies, jacques, cartier, was, one, of, the,

the, voyages, of, samuel, de, champlain, in, 1608, the, largest, settlement, was, new, france, in, 1699, french, territorial, claims, in, north, america, expanded, still, further, with, the, foundation, of, louisiana, the, french, presence, in, africa, began, in, senegal, in, 1626, although, formal, colonies, and, trading, posts, were, not, established, until, 1659, with, the, founding, of, saint, louis, the, first, french, settlement, of, madagascar, began, in, 1642, with, the, establishment, of, fort, dauphin, louis, xiv, known, as, the, sun, king, reigned, over, france, from, 1643, until, 1715, louis, continued, his, predecessors, work, of, creating, a, centralized, state, governed, from, paris, sought, to, eliminate, remnants, of, feudalism, in, france, and, subjugated, and, weakened, the, aristocracy, by, these, means, he, consolidated, a, system, of, absolute, monarchical, rule, in, france, that, endured, until, the, french, revolution, however, louis, xiv, s, long, reign, saw, france, involved, in, many, wars, that, drained, its, treasury, france, dominated, league, of, the, rhine, fought, against, the, ottoman, turks, at, the, battle, of, saint, gotthard, in, 1664, france, fought, the, war, of, devolution, against, spain, in, 1667, france, s, defeat, of, spain, and, invasion, of, the, spanish, netherlands, alarmed, england, and, sweden, with, the, dutch, republic, they, formed, the, triple, alliance, to, check, louis, xiv, s, expansion, louis, ii, de, bourbon, had, captured, franche, comt, but, in, face, of, an, indefensible, position, louis, xiv, agreed, to, the, peace, of, aachen, war, broke, out, again, between, france, and, the, dutch, republic, in, the, franco, dutch, war, 1672, 78, france, attacked, the, dutch, republic, and, was, joined, by, england, in, this, conflict, through, targeted, inundations, of, polders, by, breaking, dykes, the, french, invasion, of, the, dutch, republic, was, brought, to, a, halt, the, dutch, admiral, michiel, de, ruyter, inflicted, a, few, strategic, defeats, on, the, anglo, french, naval, alliance, and, forced, england, to, retire, from, the, war, in, 1674, because, the, netherlands, could, not, resist, indefinitely, it, agreed, to, peace, in, the, treaties, of, nijmegen, according, to, which, france, would, annex, france, comt, and, acquire, further, concessions, in, the, spanish, netherlands, in, may, 1682, the, royal, court, moved, to, the, lavish, palace, of, versailles, which, louis, xiv, had, greatly, expanded, over, time, louis, xiv, compelled, many, members, of, the, nobility, especially, the, noble, elite, to, inhabit, versailles, he, controlled, the, nobility, with, an, elaborate, system, of, pensions, and, privileges, and, replaced, their, power, with, himself, peace, did, not, last, and, war, between, france, and, spain, again, resumed, the, war, of, the, reunions, broke, out, 1683, 84, and, again, spain, with, its, ally, the, holy, roman, empire, was, defeated, meanwhile, in, october, 1685, louis, signed, the, edict, of, fontainebleau, ordering, the, destruction, of, all, protestant, churches, and, schools, in, france, its, immediate, consequence, was, a, large, protestant, exodus, from, france, over, two, million, people, died, in, two, famines, in, 1693, and, 1710, france, would, soon, be, involved, in, another, war, the, war, of, the, grand, alliance, this, time, the, theatre, was, not, only, in, europe, but, also, in, north, america, although, the, war, was, long, and, difficult, it, was, also, called, the, nine, years, war, its, results, were, inconclusive, the, treaty, of, ryswick, in, 1697, confirmed, french, sovereignty, over, alsace, yet, rejected, its, claims, to, luxembourg, louis, also, had, to, evacuate, catalonia, and, the, palatinate, this, peace, was, considered, a, truce, by, all, sides, thus, war, was, to, start, again, in, 1701, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, began, the, bourbon, philip, of, anjou, was, designated, heir, to, the, throne, of, spain, as, philip, v, the, habsburg, emperor, leopold, opposed, a, bourbon, succession, because, the, power, that, such, a, succession, would, bring, to, the, bourbon, rulers, of, france, would, disturb, the, delicate, balance, of, power, in, europe, therefore, he, claimed, the, spanish, thrones, for, himself, england, and, the, dutch, republic, joined, leopold, against, louis, xiv, and, philip, of, anjou, they, inflicted, a, few, resounding, defeats, on, the, french, army, the, battle, of, blenheim, in, 1704, was, the, first, major, land, battle, lost, by, france, since, its, victory, at, rocroi, in, 1643, yet, the, extremely, bloody, battles, of, ramillies, 1706, and, malplaquet, 1709, proved, to, be, pyrrhic, victories, for, the, allies, as, they, had, lost, too, many, men, to, continue, the, war, led, by, villars, french, forces, recovered, much, of, the, lost, ground, in, battles, such, as, denain, 1712, finally, a, compromise, was, achieved, with, the, treaty, of, utrecht, in, 1713, philip, of, anjou, was, confirmed, as, philip, v, king, of, spain, emperor, leopold, did, not, get, the, throne, but, philip, v, was, barred, from, inheriting, france, louis, xiv, wanted, to, be, remembered, as, a, patron, of, the, arts, and, invited, jean, baptiste, lully, to, establish, the, french, opera, the, wars, were, so, expensive, and, so, inconclusive, that, although, france, gained, some, territory, to, the, east, its, enemies, gained, more, strength, than, it, did, vauban, france, s, leading, military, strategist, warned, the, king, in, 1689, that, a, hostile, alliance, was, too, powerful, at, sea, he, recommended, the, best, way, for, france, to, fight, back, was, to, license, french, merchants, ships, to, privateer, and, seize, enemy, merchant, ships, while, avoiding, its, navies, vauban, was, pessimistic, about, france, s, so, called, friends, and, allies, and, recommended, against, expensive, land, wars, or, hopeless, naval, wars, louis, xiv, died, in, 1715, and, was, succeeded, by, his, five, year, old, great, grandson, who, reigned, as, louis, xv, until, his, death, in, 1774, in, 1718, france, was, once, again, at, war, as, philip, ii, of, orl, ans, s, regency, joined, the, war, of, the, quadruple, alliance, against, spain, in, 1733, another, war, broke, in, central, europe, this, time, about, the, polish, succession, and, france, joined, the, war, against, the, austrian, empire, peace, was, settled, in, the, treaty, of, vienna, 1738, according, to, which, france, would, annex, through, inheritance, the, duchy, of, lorraine, two, years, later, in, 1740, war, broke, out, over, the, austrian, succession, and, france, seized, the, opportunity, to, join, the, conflict, the, war, played, out, in, north, america, and, india, as, well, as, europe, and, inconclusive, terms, were, agreed, to, in, the, treaty, of, aix, la, chapelle, 1748, prussia, was, then, becoming, a, new, threat, as, it, had, gained, substantial, territory, from, austria, this, led, to, the, diplomatic, revolution, of, 1756, in, which, the, alliances, seen, during, the, previous, war, were, mostly, inverted, france, was, now, allied, to, austria, and, russia, while, britain, was, now, allied, to, prussia, in, the, north, american, theatre, france, was, allied, with, various, native, american, peoples, during, the, seven, years, war, and, despite, a, temporary, success, at, the, battles, of, the, great, meadows, and, monongahela, french, forces, were, defeated, at, the, disastrous, battle, of, the, plains, of, abraham, in, quebec, in, 1762, russia, france, and, austria, were, on, the, verge, of, crushing, prussia, when, the, anglo, prussian, alliance, was, saved, by, the, miracle, of, the, house, of, brandenburg, at, sea, naval, defeats, against, british, fleets, at, lagos, and, quiberon, bay, in, 1759, and, a, crippling, blockade, forced, france, to, keep, its, ships, in, port, finally, peace, was, concluded, in, the, treaty, of, paris, 1763, and, france, lost, its, north, american, empire, britain, s, success, in, the, seven, years, war, had, allowed, them, to, eclipse, france, as, the, leading, colonial, power, france, sought, revenge, for, this, defeat, and, under, choiseul, france, started, to, rebuild, in, 1766, the, french, kingdom, annexed, lorraine, and, the, following, year, bought, corsica, from, genoa, having, lost, its, colonial, empire, france, saw, a, good, opportunity, for, revenge, against, britain, in, signing, an, alliance, with, the, americans, in, 1778, and, sending, an, army, and, navy, that, turned, the, american, revolution, into, a, world, war, admiral, de, grasse, defeated, a, british, fleet, at, chesapeake, bay, while, jean, baptiste, donatien, de, vimeur, comte, de, rochambeau, and, gilbert, du, motier, marquis, de, lafayette, joined, american, forces, in, defeating, the, british, at, yorktown, the, war, was, concluded, by, the, treaty, of, paris, 1783, the, united, states, became, independent, the, british, royal, navy, scored, a, major, victory, over, france, in, 1782, at, the, battle, of, the, saintes, and, france, finished, the, war, with, huge, debts, and, the, minor, gain, of, the, island, of, tobago, the, philosophes, were, 18th, century, french, intellectuals, who,

system, lavoisier, also, formulated, the, law, of, conservation, of, mass, and, discovered, oxygen, and, hydrogen, the, french, revolution, was, a, period, of, political, and, societal, change, in, france, that, began, with, the, estates, general, of, 1789, and, ended, with, the, coup, of, 18, brumaire, in, november, 1799, and, the, formation, of, the, french, consulate, many, of, its, ideas, are, considered, fundamental, principles, of, liberal, democracy, while, its, values, and, institutions, remain, central, to, modern, french, political, discourse, its, causes, are, generally, agreed, to, be, a, combination, of, social, political, and, economic, factors, which, the, ancien, r, gime, proved, unable, to, manage, a, financial, crisis, and, widespread, social, distress, led, in, may, 1789, to, the, convocation, of, the, estates, general, which, was, converted, into, a, national, assembly, in, june, the, storming, of, the, bastille, on, 14, july, led, to, a, series, of, radical, measures, by, the, assembly, among, them, the, abolition, of, feudalism, state, control, over, the, catholic, church, in, france, and, a, declaration, of, rights, the, next, three, years, were, dominated, by, the, struggle, for, political, control, exacerbated, by, economic, depression, military, defeats, following, the, outbreak, of, the, french, revolutionary, wars, in, april, 1792, resulted, in, the, insurrection, of, 10, august, 1792, the, monarchy, was, abolished, and, replaced, by, the, french, first, republic, in, september, while, louis, xvi, was, executed, in, january,

scandinavian, kingdoms, were, against, the, british, blockade, of, france, the, second, coalition, was, beaten, and, peace, was, settled, in, two, distinct, treaties, the, treaty, of, lun, ville, and, the, treaty, of, amiens, a, brief, interlude, of, peace, ensued, in, 1802, 03, during, which, napoleon, sold, french, louisiana, to, the, united, states, because, it, was, indefensible, in, 1801, napoleon, concluded, a, concordat, with, pope, pius, vii, that, opened, peaceful, relations, between, church, and, state, in, france, the, policies, of, the, revolution, were, reversed, except, the,

empire, was, met, by, the, third, coalition, the, french, army, was, renamed, la, grande, arm, e, in, 1805, and, napoleon, used, propaganda, and, nationalism, to, control, the, french, population,

empire, was, also, not, alone, since, it, now, had, a, complex, network, of, allies, and, subject, states, the, largely, outnumbered, french, army, crushed, the, prussian, army, at, jena, auerstedt, in, 1806, napoleon, captured, berlin, and, went, as, far, as, eastern, prussia, there, the, russian, empire, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, friedland, 14, june, 1807, peace, was, dictated, in, the, treaties, of, tilsit, in, which, russia, had, to, join, the, continental, system, and, prussia, handed, half, of, its, territories, to, france, the, duchy, of, warsaw, was, formed, over, these,

and, tried, to, prevent, merchants, across, europe, from, trading, with, british, the, large, amount, of, smuggling, frustrated, napoleon, and, did, more, harm, to, his, economy, than, to, his, enemies, freed, from, his, obligation, in, the, east, napoleon, then, went, back, to, the, west, as, the, french, empire, was, still, at, war, with, britain, only, two, countries, remained, neutral, in, the, war, sweden, and, portugal, and, napoleon, then, looked, toward, the, latter, in, the, treaty, of, fontainebleau, 1807, a, franco, spanish, alliance, against, portugal, was, sealed, as, spain, eyed, portuguese, territories, french, armies, entered, spain, in, order, to, attack, portugal, but, then, seized, spanish, fortresses, and, took, over, the, kingdom, by, surprise, joseph,

to, portugal, and, french, forces, evacuated, portugal, as, defined, in, the, convention, of, sintra, following, the, allied, victory, at, vimeiro, 21, august, 1808, france, only, controlled, catalonia, and, navarre, and, could, have, been, definitely, expelled, from, the, iberian, peninsula, had, the, spanish, armies, attacked, again, but, the, spanish, did, not, another, french, attack, was, launched, on, spain, led, by, napoleon, himself, and, was, described, as, an, avalanche, of, fire, and, steel, however, the, french, empire, was, no, longer, regarded, as, invincible, by, european, powers, in, 1808, austria, formed, the, fifth, coalition, in, order, to, break, down, the, french, empire, the, austrian, empire, defeated, the, french, at, aspern, essling, yet, was, beaten, at, wagram, while, the, polish, allies, defeated, the, austrian, empire, at, raszyn, april, 1809, although, not, as, decisive, as, the, previous, austrian, defeats, the, peace, treaty, in, october, 1809, stripped, austria, of, a, large, amount, of, territory, reducing, it, even, more, in, 1812, war, broke, out, with, russia, engaging, napoleon, in, the, disastrous, french, invasion, of, russia, 1812, napoleon, assembled, the, largest, army, europe, had, ever, seen, including, troops, from, all, subject, states, to, invade, russia, which, had, just, left, the, continental, system, and, was, gathering, an, army, on, the, polish, frontier, following, an, exhausting, march, and, the, bloody, but, inconclusive, battle, of, borodino, near, moscow, the, grande, arm, e, entered, and, captured, moscow, only, to, find, it, burning, as, part, of, the, russian, scorched, earth, tactics, although, there, still, were, battles, the, napoleonic, army, left, russia, in, late, 1812, annihilated, most, of, all, by, the, russian, winter, exhaustion, and, scorched, earth, warfare, on, the, spanish, front, the, french, troops, were, defeated, at, vitoria, june, 1813, and, then, at, the, battle, of, the, pyrenees, july, august, 1813, since, the, spanish, guerrillas, seemed, to, be, uncontrollable, the, french, troops, eventually, evacuated, spain, since, france, had, been, defeated, on, these, two, fronts, states, that, had, been, conquered, and, controlled, by, napoleon, saw, a, good, opportunity, to, strike, back, the, sixth, coalition, was, formed, under, british,

although, the, six, days, campaign, is, often, considered, a, tactical, masterpiece, because, the, allies, suffered, much, higher, casualties, napoleon, abdicated, on, 6, april, 1814, and, was, exiled, to, elba, the, conservative, congress, of, vienna, reversed, the, political, changes, that, had, occurred, during, the, wars, napoleon, suddenly, returned, seized, control, of, france, raised, an, army, and, marched, on, his, enemies, in, the, hundred, days, it, ended, with, his, final, defeat, at, the, battle, of, waterloo, in, 1815, and, his, exile, to, st, helena, a, remote, island, in, the, south, atlantic, ocean, the, monarchy, was, subsequently, restored, and, louis, xviii, younger, brother, of, louis, xvi, became, king, and, the, exiles, returned, however, many, of, the, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, reforms, were, kept, in, place, napoleon, centralized, power, in, paris, with, all, the, provinces, governed, by, all, powerful, prefects, whom, he, selected, they,

century, onward, a, distinction, is, generally, made, between, the, first, colonial, empire, that, existed, until, 1814, by, which, time, most, of, it, had, been, lost, and, the, second, colonial, empire, which, began, with, the, conquest, of, algiers, in, 1830, the, second, colonial, empire, came, to, an, end, after, the, loss, in, later, wars, of, vietnam, 1954, and, algeria, 1962, and, relatively, peaceful, decolonizations, elsewhere, after, 1960, france, lost, wars, to, britain, that, stripped, away, nearly, all, of, its, colonies, by, 1765, france, rebuilt, a, new, empire, mostly, after, 1850, concentrating, chiefly, in, africa, as, well, as, indochina, and, the, south, pacific, republicans, at, first, hostile, to, empire, only, became, supportive, when, germany, after, 1880,

living, in, them, in, 2013, by, the, 1970s, the, last, vestiges, of, empire, held, little, interest, for, the, french, except, for, the, traumatic, decolonization, of, algeria, however, what, is, remarkable, is, how, few, long, lasting, effects, on, france, the, giving, up, of, empire, entailed, the, population, held, steady, from, 40, 7, million, in, 1911, to, 41, 5, million, in, 1936, the, sense, that, the, population, was, too, small, especially, in, regard, to, the, rapid, growth, of, more, powerful, germany, was, a, common, theme, in, the, early, twentieth, century, natalist, policies, were, proposed, in, the, 1930s, and, implemented, in, the, 1940s, france, experienced, a, baby, boom, after, 1945, it, reversed, a, long, term, record, of, low, birth, rates, in, addition, there, was, a, steady, immigration, especially, from, former, french, colonies, in, north, africa, the, population, grew, from, 41, million, in, 1946, to, 50, million, in, 1966, and, 60, million, by, 1990, the, farming, population, declined, sharply, from, 35, of, the, workforce, in, 1945, to, under, 5, by, 2000, by, 2004, france, had, the, second, highest, birthrate, in, europe, behind, only, ireland, france, did, not, expect, war, in, 1914, but, when, it, came, in, august, the, entire, nation, rallied, enthusiastically, for, two, years, it, specialized, in, sending, infantry, forward, again, and, again, only, to, be, stopped, again, and, again, by, german, artillery, trenches, barbed, wire, and, machine, guns, with, horrific, casualty, rates, despite, the, loss, of, major, industrial, districts, france, produced, an, enormous, output, of, munitions, that, armed, both, the, french, and, the, american, armies, by, 1917, the, infantry, was, on, the, verge, of, mutiny, with, a, widespread, sense, that, it, was, now, the, american, turn, to, storm, the, german, lines, but, they, rallied, and, defeated, the, greatest, german, offensive, which, came, in, spring, 1918, then, rolled, over, the, collapsing, invaders, november, 1918, brought, a, surge, of, pride, and, unity, and, an, unrestrained, demand, for, revenge, preoccupied, with, internal, problems, france, paid, little, attention, to, foreign, policy, in, the, 1911, 14, period, although, it, did, extend, military, service, to, three, years, from, two, over, strong, socialist, objections, in, 1913, the, rapidly, escalating, balkan, crisis, of, 1914, caught, france, unaware, and, it, played, only, a, small, role, in, the, coming, of, world, war, i, the, serbian, crisis, triggered, a, complex, set, of, military, alliances, between, european, states, causing, most, of, the, continent, including, france, to, be, drawn, into, war, within, a, few, short, weeks, austria, hungary, declared, war, on,

other, countries, involved, including, france, the, german, empire, as, an, ally, of, austria, declared, war, on, russia, france, was, allied, with, russia, and, so, was, ready, to, commit, to, war, against, the, german, empire, on, 3, august, germany, declared, war, on, france, and, sent, its, armies, through, neutral, belgium, britain, entered, the, war, on, 4, august, and, started, sending, in, troops, on, 7, august, italy, although, tied, to, germany, remained, neutral, and, then, joined, the, allies, in, 1915, germany, s, schlieffen, plan, was, to, quickly, defeat, the, french, they, captured, brussels, belgium, by, 20, august, and, soon, had, captured, a, large, portion, of, northern, france, the, original, plan, was, to, continue, southwest, and, attack, paris, from, the, west, by, early, september, they, were, within, 65, kilometres, 40, mi, of, paris, and, the, french, government, had, relocated, to, bordeaux, the, allies, finally, stopped, the, advance, northeast, of, paris, at, the, marne, river, 5, 12, september, 1914, the, war, now, became, a, stalemate, the, famous, western, front, was, fought, largely, in, france, and, was, characterized, by, very, little, movement, despite, extremely, large, and, violent, battles, often, with, new, and, more, destructive, military, technology, on, the, western, front, the, small, improvised, trenches, of, the, first, few, months, rapidly, grew, deeper, and, more, complex, gradually, becoming, vast, areas, of, interlocking, defensive, works, the, land, war, quickly, became, dominated, by, the, muddy, bloody, stalemate, of, trench, warfare, a, form, of, war, in, which, both, opposing, armies, had, static, lines, of, defense, the, war, of, movement, quickly, turned, into, a, war, of, position, neither, side, advanced, much, but, both, sides, suffered, hundreds, of, thousands, of, casualties, german, and, allied, armies, produced, essentially, a, matched, pair, of, trench, lines, from, the, swiss, border, in, the, south, to, the, north, sea, coast, of, belgium, meanwhile, large, swaths, of, northeastern, france, came, under, the, brutal, control, of, german, occupiers, trench, warfare, prevailed, on, the, western, front, from, september, 1914, until, march, 1918, famous, battles, in, france, include, the, battle, of, verdun, and, the, battle, of, the, somme, in, 1916, and, five,

which, was, a, wartime, truce, between, the, right, and, left, factions, that, had, been, fighting, bitterly, france, had, few, dissenters, however, war, weariness, was, a, major, factor, by, 1917, even, reaching, the, army, the, soldiers, were, reluctant, to, attack, mutiny, was, a, factor, as, soldiers, said, it, was, best, to, wait, for, the, arrival, of, millions, of, americans, the, soldiers, were, protesting, not, just, the, futility, of, frontal, assaults, in, the, face, of, german, machine, guns, but, also, degraded, conditions, at, the, front, lines, and, at, home, especially, infrequent, leaves, poor, food, the, use, of, african, and, asian, colonials, on, the, home, front, and, concerns, about, the, welfare, of, their, wives, and, children, after, defeating, russia, in, 1917, germany, now, could, concentrate, on, the, western, front, and, planned, an, all, out, assault, in, the, spring, of, 1918, but, had, to, do, it, before, the, very, rapidly, growing, american, army, played, a, role, in, march, 1918, germany, launched, its, offensive, and, by, may, had, reached, the, marne, and, was, again, close, to, paris, however, in, the, second, battle, of, the, marne, 15, july, to, 6, august, 1918, the, allied, line, held, the, allies, then, shifted, to, the, offensive, the, germans, out, of, reinforcements, were, overwhelmed, day, after, day, and, the,

four, times, as, many, military, casualties, the, economy, was, hurt, by, the, 1913, german, invasion, of, major, industrial, areas, in, the, northeast, which, produced, 58, of, the, steel, and, 40, of, the, coal, in, 1914, the, government, implemented, a, war, economy, with, controls, and, rationing, by, 1915, the, war, economy, went, into, high, gear, as, millions, of, french, women, and, colonial, men, replaced, the, civilian, roles, of, many, of, the, 3, million, soldiers, considerable, assistance, came, with, the, influx, of, american, food, money, and, raw, materials, in, 1917, this, war, economy, would, have, important, reverberations, after, the, war, as, it, would, be, a, first, breach, of, liberal, theories, of, non, interventionism, the, damages, caused, by, the, war, amounted, to, about, 113, of, the, gdp, of, 1913, chiefly, the, destruction, of, productive, capital, and, housing, the, national, debt, rose, from, 66, of, gdp, in, 1913, to, 170, in, 1919, reflecting, the, heavy, use, of, bond, issues, to, pay, for, the, war, inflation, was, severe, with, the, franc, losing, over, half, its, value, against, the, british, pound, the, richest, families, were, hurt, as, the, top, 1, percent, saw, their, share, of, wealth, drop, from, about, 60, in, 1914, to, 36, in, 1935, then, plunge, to, 20, percent, in, 1970, to, the, present, a, great, deal, of,

united, states, clemenceau, demanded, the, harshest, terms, and, won, most, of, them, in, the, treaty, of, versailles, in, 1919, germany, was, forced, to, admit, its, guilt, for, starting, the, war, and, was, permanently, weakened, militarily, germany, had, to, pay, huge, sums, in, war, reparations, to, the, allies, who, in, turn, had, large, loans, from, the, u, s, to, pay, off, france,

ferdinand, foch, wanted, a, peace, that, would, never, allow, germany, to, be, a, threat, to, france, again, but, after, the, treaty, of, versailles, was, signed, he, said, this, is, not, a, peace, it, is, an, armistice, for, 20, years, france, was, part, of, the, allied, force, that, occupied, the, rhineland, following, the, armistice, foch, supported, poland, in, the, greater, poland, uprising, and, in, the, polish, soviet, war, and, france, also, joined, spain, during, the, rif, war, from, 1925, until, his, death, in, 1932, aristide, briand, as, prime, minister, during, five, short, intervals, directed, french, foreign, policy, using, his, diplomatic, skills, and, sense, of, timing, to, forge, friendly, relations, with, weimar, germany, as, the, basis, of, a, genuine, peace, within, the, framework, of, the, league, of, nations, he, realized, france, could, neither, contain, the, much, larger, germany, by, itself, nor, secure, effective, support, from, britain, or, the, league, as, a, response, to, the, weimar, republic, s, default, on, its, reparations, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, i, france, occupied, the, industrial, region, of, the, ruhr, as, a, means, of, ensuring, german, payments, the, intervention, was, a, failure, and, france, accepted, the, international, solution, to, the, reparations, issues, as, expressed, in, the, dawes, plan, and, the, young, plan, politically, the, 1920s, was, dominated, by, the, right, with, right, wing, coalitions, in, 1919, 1926, and, 1928, and, later, in, 1934, and, 1938, in, the, 1920s, france, established, an, elaborate, system, of, border, defences, called, the, maginot, line, designed, to, fight, off, any, german, attack, the, line, did, not, extend, into, belgium, which, germany, would, exploit, in, 1940, military, alliances, were, signed, with, weak, powers, in, 1920, 21, called, the, little, entente, the, great, depression, affected, france, a, bit, later, than, other, countries, hitting, around, 1931, while, the, gdp, in, the, 1920s, grew, at, the, very, strong, rate, of, 4, 43, per, year, the, 1930s, rate, fell, to, only, 0, 63, the, depression, was, relatively, mild, unemployment, peaked, under, 5, the, fall, in, production, was, at, most, 20, below, the, 1929, output, there, was, no, banking, crisis, in, contrast, to, the, mild, economic, upheaval, the, political, upheaval, was, enormous, socialist, leon, blum, leading, the, popular, front, brought, together, socialists, and, radicals, to, become, prime, minister, from, 1936, to, 1937, he, was, the, first, jew, and, the, first, socialist, to, lead, france, the, communists, in, the, chamber, of, deputies, voted, to, keep, the, government, in, power, and, generally, supported, the, government, s, economic, policies, but, rejected, its, foreign, policies, the, popular, front, passed, numerous, labor, reforms, which, increased, wages, cut, working, hours, to, 40, hours, with, overtime, illegal, and, provided, many, lesser, benefits, to, the, working, class, such, as, mandatory, two, week, paid, vacations, however, renewed, inflation, cancelled, the, gains, in, wage, rates, unemployment, did, not, fall, and, economic, recovery, was, very, slow, the, popular, front, failed, in, economics, foreign, policy, and, long, term, stability, disappointment, and, failure, was, the, legacy, of, the, popular, front, at, first, the, popular, front, created, enormous, excitement, and, expectations, on, the, left, including, very, large, scale, sitdown, strikes, but, in, the, end, it, failed, to, live, up, to, its, promise, however, socialists, would, later, take, inspiration, from, the, attempts, of, the, popular, front, to, set, up, a, welfare, state, the, government, joined, britain, in, establishing, an, arms, embargo, during, the, spanish, civil, war, 1936, 1939, blum, rejected, support, for, the, spanish, republicans, because, of, his, fear, that, civil, war, might, spread, to, deeply, divided, france, financial, support, in, military, cooperation, with, poland, was, also, a, policy, the, government, nationalized, arms, suppliers, and, dramatically, increased, its, program, of, rearming, the, french, military, in, a, last, minute, catch, up, with, the, germans, appeasement, of, germany, in, cooperation, with, britain, was, the, policy, after, 1936, as, france, sought, peace, even, in, the, face, of, hitler, s, escalating, demands, prime, minister, douard, daladier, refused, to, go, to, war, against, germany, and, italy, without, british, support, as, neville, chamberlain, wanted, to, save, peace, at, munich, in, 1938, germany, s, invasion, of, poland, in, 1939, finally, caused, france, and, britain, to, declare, war, against, germany, but, the, allies, did, not, launch, massive, assaults, and, instead, kept, a, defensive, stance, this, was, called, the, phoney, war, in, britain, or, dr, le, de, guerre, the, funny, sort, of, war, in, france, it, did, not, prevent, the, german, army, from, conquering, poland, in, a, matter, of, weeks, with, its, innovative, blitzkrieg, tactics, also, helped, by, the, soviet, union, s, attack, on, poland, when, germany, had, its, hands, free, for, an, attack, in, the, west, the, battle, of, france, began, in, may, 1940, and, the, same, blitzkrieg, tactics, proved, just, as, devastating, there, the, wehrmacht, bypassed, the, maginot, line, by, marching, through, the, ardennes, forest, a, second, german, force, was, sent, into, belgium, and, the, netherlands, to, act, as, a, diversion, to, this, main, thrust, in, six, weeks, of, savage, fighting, the, french, lost, 90, 000, men, many, civilians, sought, refuge, by, taking, to, the, roads, of, france, some, 2, million, refugees, from, belgium, and, the, netherlands, were, joined, by, between, 8, and, 10, million, french, civilians, representing, a, quarter, of, the, french, population, all, heading, south, and, west, this, movement, may, well, have, been, the, largest, single, movement, of, civilians, in, history, prior, to, the, partition, of, india, in, 1947, paris, fell, to, the, germans, on, 14, june, 1940, but, not, before, the,

kept, most, of, the, french, army, in, camps, in, germany, and, france, had, to, pay, out, large, sums, in, gold, and, food, supplies, germany, occupied, three, fifths, of, france, s, territory, leaving, the, rest, in, the, southeast, to, the, new, vichy, government, however, in, practice, most, local, government, was, handled, by, the, traditional, french, officialdom, in, november, 1942, all, of, vichy, france, was, finally, occupied, by, german, forces, vichy, continued, in, existence, but, it, was, closely, supervised, by, the, germans, the, vichy, regime, sought, to, collaborate, with, germany, keeping, peace, in, france, to, avoid, further, occupation, although, at, the, expense, of, personal, freedom, and, individual, safety, some, 76, 000, jews, were, deported, during, the, german, occupation, often, with, the, help, of, the, vichy, authorities, and, murdered, in, the, nazis, extermination, camps, the, french, soldiers, held, as, pows, and, forced, laborers, in, germany, throughout, the, war, were, not, at, risk, of, death, in, combat, but, the, anxieties, of, separation, for, their, wives, were, high, the, government, provided, them, a, modest, allowance, but, one, in, ten, became, prostitutes, to, support, their, families, it, gave, women, a, key, symbolic, role, to, carry, out, the, national, regeneration, it, used, propaganda, women, s, organizations, and, legislation, to, promote, maternity, patriotic, duty, and, female, submission, to, marriage, home, and, children, s, education, conditions, were, very, difficult, for, housewives, as, food, and, other, necessities, were, in, short, supply, divorce, laws, were, made, much, more, stringent, and, restrictions, were, placed, on, the, employment, of, married, women, family, allowances, that, had, begun, in, the, 1930s, were, continued, and, became, a, vital, lifeline, for, many, families, it, was, a, monthly, cash, bonus, for, having, more, children, in, 1942, the, birth, rate, started, to, rise, and, by, 1945, it, was, higher, than, it, had, been, for, a, century, general, charles, de, gaulle, in, london, declared, himself, on, bbc, radio, to, be, the, head, of, a, rival, government, in, exile, and, gathered, the, free, french, forces, around, him, finding, support, in, some, french, colonies, and, recognition, from, britain, but, not, the, united, states, after, the, attack, on, mers, el, k, bir, in, 1940, where, the, british, fleet, destroyed, a, large, part, of, the, french, navy, still, under, command, of, vichy, france, that, killed, about, 1, 100, sailors, there, was, nationwide, indignation, and, a, feeling, of, distrust, in, the, french, forces, leading, to, the, events, of, the, battle, of, dakar, eventually, several, important, french, ships, joined, the, free, french, forces, the, united, states, maintained, diplomatic, relations, with, vichy, and, avoided, recognition, of, de, gaulle, s, claim, to, be, the, one, and, only, government, of, france, churchill, caught, between, the, u, s, and, de, gaulle, tried, to, find, a, compromise, within, france, proper, the, organized, underground, grew, as, the, vichy, regime, resorted, to, more, strident, policies, in, order, to, fulfill, the, enormous, demands, of, the, nazis, and, the, eventual, decline, of, nazi, germany, became, more, obvious, they, formed, the, resistance, the, most, famous, figure, of, the, french, resistance, was, jean, moulin, sent, in, france, by, de, gaulle, in, order, to, link, all, resistance, movements, he, was, captured, and, tortured, by, klaus, barbie, the, butcher, of, lyon, increasing, repression, culminated, in, the, complete, destruction, and, extermination, of, the, village, of, oradour, sur, glane, at, the, height, of, the, battle, of, normandy, on, 10, june, 1944, a, company, of, the, 2nd, ss, panzer, division, entered, oradour, sur, glane, and, massacred, 642, men, women, and, children, all, of, whom, were, civilians, in, 1953, 21, men,

french, forces, of, the, interior, de, gaulle, s, formal, name, for, resistance, fighters, to, continue, the, war, until, the, final, defeat, of, germany, this, army, numbered, 300, 000, men, by, september, and, 370, 000, by, spring, 1945, the, vichy, regime, disintegrated, an, interim, provisional, government, of, the, french, republic, was, quickly, put, into, place, by, de, gaulle, the, gouvernement, provisoire, de, la, r, publique, fran, aise, or, gprf, operated, under, a, tripartisme, alliance, of, communists, socialists, and, democratic, republicans, the, gprf, governed, france, from, 1944, to, 1946, when, it, was, replaced, by, the, french, fourth, republic, tens, of, thousands, of, collaborators, were, executed, without, trial, the, new, government, declared, the, vichy, laws, unconstitutional, and, illegal, and, elected, new, local, governments, women, gained, the, right, to, vote, the, political, scene, in, 1944, 45, was, controlled, by, the, resistance, but, it, had, numerous, factions, charles, de, gaulle, and, the, free, france, element, had, been, based, outside, france, but, now, came, to, dominate, in, alliance, with, the, socialists, the, christian, democrats, mrp, and, what, remained, of, the, radical, party, the, communists, had, largely, dominated, the, resistance, inside, france, but, cooperated, closely, with, the, government, in, 1944, 45, on, orders, from, the, kremlin, there, was, a, general, consensus, that, important, powers, that, had, been, an, open, collaboration, with, the, germans, should, be, nationalized, such, as, renault, automobiles, and, the, major, newspapers, a, new, social, security, system, was, called, for, as, well, as, important, new, concessions, to, the, labour, unions, unions, themselves, were, divided, among, communist, socialist, and, christian, democrat, factions, frustrated, by, his, inability, to, control, all, the, dominant, forces, de, gaulle, resigned, in, 1946, on, 13, october, 1946, a, new, constitution, established, the, fourth, republic, the, fourth, republic, consisted, of, a, parliamentary, government, controlled, by, a, series, of, coalitions, france, attempted, to, regain, control, of, french, indochina, but, was, defeated, by, the, viet, minh, in, 1954, only, months, later, france, faced, another, anti, colonialist, conflict, in, algeria, and, the, debate, over, whether, or, not, to, keep, control, of, algeria, then, home, to, over, one, million, european, settlers, wracked, the, country, and, nearly, led, to, a, coup, and, civil, war, charles, de, gaulle, managed, to, keep, the, country, together, while, taking, steps, to, end, the, war, the, algerian, war, was, concluded, with, the, vian, accords, in, 1962, which, led, to, algerian, independence, the, june, 1951, elections, saw, a, re, emergence, of, the, right, and, until, june, 1954, france, was, governed, by, a, succession, of, centre, right, coalitions, wartime, damage, to, the, economy, was, severe, and, apart, from, gold, reserves, france, had, inadequate, resources, to, recover, on, its, own, the, transportation, system, was, in, total, shambles, the, allies, had, bombed, out, the, railways, and, the, bridges, and, the, germans, had, destroyed, the, port, facilities, energy, was, in, extremely, short, supply, with, very, low, stocks, of, coal, and, oil, imports, of, raw, materials, were, largely, cut, off, so, most, factories, shut, down, the, invaders, had, stripped, most, of, the, valuable, industrial, tools, for, german, factories, discussions, with, the, united, states, for, emergency, aid, dragged, on, with, repeated, postponements, on, both, sides, meanwhile, several, million, french, prisoners, of, war, and, forced, labourers, were, being, returned, home, with, few, jobs, and, little, food, available, for, them, the, plan, was, for, 20, percent, of, german, reparations, to, be, paid, to, france, but, germany, was, in, much, worse, shape, even, in, france, and, in, no, position, to, pay, after, de, gaulle, left, office, in, january, 1946, the, diplomatic, logjam, was, broken, in, terms, of, american, aid, the, u, s, army, shipped, in, food, from, 1944, to, 1946, and, u, s, treasury, loans, and, cash, grants, were, disbursed, from, 1945, until, 1947, with, marshall, plan, aid, continuing, until, 1951, france, received, additional, aid, from, 1951, to, 1955, in, order, to, help, the, country, in, its, war, in, indochina, apart, from, low, interest, loans, the, other, funds, were, grants, that, did, not, involve, repayment, the, debts, left, over, from, world, war, i, whose, payment, had, been, suspended, since, 1931, were, renegotiated, in, the, blum, byrnes, agreement, of, 1946, the, united, states, forgave, all, 2, 8, billion, in, debt, from, the, first, world, war, and, gave, france, a, new, loan, of, 650, million, in, return, french, negotiator, jean, monnet, set, out, the, french, five, year, plan, for, recovery, and, development, the, marshall, plan, gave, france, 2, 3, billion, with, no, repayment, the, total, of, all, american, grants, and, credits, to, france, from, 1946, to, 1953, amounted, to, 4, 9, billion, a, central, feature, of, the, marshall, plan, was, to, encourage, international, trade, reduce, tariffs, lower, barriers, and, modernize, french, management, the, marshall, plan, set, up, intensive, tours, of, american, industry, france, sent, missions, of, businessmen, and, experts, to, tour, american, factories, farms, stores, and, offices, they, were, especially, impressed, with, the, prosperity, of, american, workers, and, how, the, price, of, vehicles, some, french, businesses, resisted, americanization, but, the, most, profitable, especially, chemicals, oil, electronics, and, instrumentation, seized, upon, the, opportunity, to, attract, american, investments, and, build, a, larger, market, the, u, s, insisted, on, opportunities, for, hollywood, films, and, the, french, film, industry, responded, with, new, life, although, the, economic, situation, in, france, was, grim, in, 1945, resources, did, exist, and, the, economy, regained, normal, growth, by, the, 1950s, france, managed, to, regain, its, international, status, thanks, to, a, successful, production, strategy, a, demographic, spurt, and, technical, and, political, innovations, conditions, varied, from, firm, to, firm, some, had, been, destroyed, or, damaged, nationalized, or, requisitioned, but, the, majority, carried, on, sometimes, working, harder, and, more, efficiently, than, before, the, war, despite, strong, american, pressure, through, the, erp, there, was, little, change, in, the, organization, and, content, of, the, training, for, french, industrial, managers, this, was, mainly, due, to, the, reticence, of, the, existing, institutions, and, the, struggle, among, different, economic, and, political, interest, groups, for, control, over, efforts, to, improve, the, further, training, of, practitioners, the, monnet, plan, provided, a, coherent, framework, for, economic, policy, and, it, was, strongly, supported, by, the, marshall, plan, it, was, inspired, by, moderate, keynesian, free, trade, ideas, rather, than, state, control, although, relaunched, in, an, original, way, the, french, economy, was, about, as, productive, as, comparable, west, european, countries, claude, fohlen, argues, that, without, the, marshall, plan, france, s, economic, recovery, would, have, been, a, much, slower, process, pierre, mend, s, france, was, a, radical, party, leader, who, was, prime, minister, for, eight, months, in, 1954, 55, working, with, the, support, of, the, socialist, and, communist, parties, his, top, priority, was, ending, the, deadly, war, in, indochina, in, the, wake, of, the, humiliating, defeat, at, the, battle, of, dien, bien, phu, the, u, s, had, paid, most, of, the, costs, of, the, war, but, its, support, inside, france, had, collapsed, in, february, 1954, only, 7, of, the, french, people, wanted, to, continue, the, fight, to, keep, indochina, out, of, ho, chi, minh, and, his, viet, minh, movement, at, the, geneva, conference, in, july, 1954, pierre, france, made, a, deal, that, gave, the, viet, minh, control, of, vietnam, north, of, the, 17th, parallel, and, allowed, france, to, pull, out, all, its, forces, that, left, south, vietnam, standing, alone, and, the, u, s, would, prove, support, for, it, afterwards, pierre, france, next, came, to, an, agreement, with, habib, bourguiba, the, nationalist, leader, in, tunisia, for, the, independence,
