the, poor, fellow, soldiers, of, christ, and, of, the, temple, of, solomon, mainly, known, as, the, knights, templar, was, a, french, military, order, of, the, catholic, faith, and, one, of, the, wealthiest, and, most, popular, military, orders, in, western, christianity, they, were, founded, c, 1119, to, defend, pilgrims, on, their, way, to, jerusalem, with, their, headquarters, located, there, on, the, temple, mount, and, existed, for, nearly, two, centuries, during, the, middle, ages, officially, endorsed, by, the, roman, catholic, church, by, such, decrees, as, the, papal, bull, omne, datum, optimum, of, pope, innocent, ii, the, templars, became, a, favoured, charity, throughout, christendom, and, grew, rapidly, in, membership, and, power, the, templar, knights, in, their, distinctive, white, mantles, with, a, red, cross, were, among, the, most, skilled, fighting, units, of, the, crusades, they, were, prominent, in, christian, finance, non, combatant, members, of, the, order, who, made, up, as, much, as, 90, of, their, members, managed, a, large, economic, infrastructure, throughout, christendom, they, developed, innovative, financial, techniques, that, were, an, early, form, of, banking, building, a, network, of, nearly, 1, 000, commanderies, and, fortifications, across, europe, and, the, holy, land, the, templars, were, closely, tied, to, the, crusades, as, they, became, unable, to, secure, their, holdings, in, the, holy, land, support, for, the, order, faded, rumours, about, the, templars, secret, initiation, ceremony, created, distrust, and, king, philip, iv, of, france, while, being, deeply, in, debt, to, the, order, used, this, distrust, to, take, advantage, of, the, situation, in, 1307, he, pressured, pope, clement, v, to, have, many, of, the, order, s, members, in, france, arrested, tortured, into, giving, false, confessions, and, then, burned, at, the, stake, under, further, pressure, pope, clement, v, disbanded, the, order, in, 1312, the, abrupt, disappearance, of, a, major, part, of, the, medieval, european, infrastructure, gave, rise, to, speculation, and, legends, which, have, currently, kept, the, templar, name, alive, the, poor, fellow, soldiers, of, christ, and, of, the, temple, of, solomon, latin, pauperes, commilitones, christi, templique, salomonici, and, french, pauvres, chevaliers, du, christ, et, du, temple, de, salomon, are, also, known, as, the, order, of, solomon, s, temple, and, mainly, the, knights, templar, french, les, chevaliers, templiers, or, simply, the, templars, french, les, templiers, the, temple, mount, where, they, had, their, headquarters, had, a, mystique, because, it, was, above, what, was, believed, to, be, the, ruins, of, the, temple, of, solomon, after, the, franks, in, the, first, crusade, captured, jerusalem, from, the, fatimid, caliphate, in, 1099, many, christians, made, pilgrimages, to, various, sacred, sites, in, the, holy, land, although, the, city, of, jerusalem, was, relatively, secure, under, christian, control, the, rest, of, outremer, was, not, bandits, and, marauding, highwaymen, preyed, upon, these, christian, pilgrims, who, were, routinely, slaughtered, sometimes, by, the, hundreds, as, they, attempted, to, make, the, journey, from, the, coastline, at, jaffa, through, to, the, interior, of, the, holy, land, in, 1119, the, french, knight, hugues, de, payens, approached, king, baldwin, ii, of, jerusalem, and, warmund, patriarch, of, jerusalem, and, proposed, creating, a, monastic, catholic, religious, order, for, the, protection, of, these, pilgrims, king, baldwin, and, patriarch, warmund, agreed, to, the, request, probably, at, the, council, of, nablus, in, january, 1120, and, the, king, granted, the, templars, a, headquarters, in, a, wing, of, the, royal, palace, on, the, temple, mount, in, the, captured, al, aqsa, mosque, the, order, with, about, nine, knights, including, godfrey, de, saint, omer, and, andr, de, montbard, had, few, financial, resources, and, relied, on, donations, to, survive, their, emblem, was, of, two, knights, riding, on, a, single, horse, emphasizing, the, order, s, poverty, the, impoverished, status, of, the, templars, did, not, last, long, they, had, a, powerful, advocate, in, saint, bernard, of, clairvaux, a, leading, church, figure, the, french, abbot, primarily, responsible, for, the, founding, of, the, cistercian, order, of, monks, and, a, nephew, of, andr, de, montbard, one, of, the, founding, knights, bernard, put, his, weight, behind, them, and, wrote, persuasively, on, their, behalf, in, the, letter, in, praise, of, the, new, knighthood, and, in, 1129, at, the, council, of, troyes, he, led, a, group, of, leading, churchmen, to, officially, approve, and, endorse, the, order, on, behalf, of, the, church, with, this, formal, blessing, the, templars, became, a, favoured, charity, throughout, christendom, receiving, money, land, businesses, and, noble, born, sons, from, families, who, were, eager, to, help, with, the, fight, in, the, holy, land, at, the, council, of, pisa, in, 1135, pope, innocent, ii, initiated, the, first, papal, monetary, donation, to, the, order, another, major, benefit, came, in, 1139, when, innocent, ii, s, papal, bull, omne, datum, optimum, exempted, the, order, from, obedience, to, local, laws, this, ruling, meant, that, the, templars, could, pass, freely, through, all, borders, were, not, required, to, pay, any, taxes, and, were, exempt, from, all, authority, except, that, of, the, pope, however, in, practice, they, often, had, to, listen, to, the, wishes, of, the, european, rulers, of, the, kingdoms, their, bases, were, in, especially, when, it, came, to, looking, after, their, nobles, money, and, possessions, when, they, were, deposited, in, their, banks, with, its, clear, mission, and, ample, resources, the, order, grew, rapidly, templars, were, often, the, advance, shock, troops, in, key, battles, of, the, crusades, as, the, heavily, armoured, knights, on, their, warhorses, would, set, out, to, charge, at, the, enemy, ahead, of, the, main, army, bodies, in, an, attempt, to, break, opposition, lines, one, of, their, most, famous, victories, was, in, 1177, during, the, battle, of, montgisard, where, some, 500, templar, knights, helped, several, thousand, infantry, to, defeat, saladin, s, army, of, more, than, 26, 000, soldiers, a, templar, knight, is, truly, a, fearless, knight, and, secure, on, every, side, for, his, soul, is, protected, by, the, armour, of, faith, just, as, his, body, is, protected, by, the, armour, of, steel, he, is, thus, doubly, armed, and, need, fear, neither, demons, nor, men, bernard, of, clairvaux, c, 1135, de, laude, novae, militae, in, praise, of, the, new, knighthood, although, the, primary, mission, of, the, order, was, militaristic, relatively, few, members, were, combatants, the, majority, acted, in, support, positions, to, assist, the, knights, and, manage, the, financial, infrastructure, the, templar, order, though, its, members, were, sworn, to, individual, poverty, was, given, control, of, wealth, beyond, direct, donations, a, nobleman, who, was, interested, in, participating, in, the, crusades, might, place, all, his, assets, under, templar, management, while, he, was, away, accumulating, wealth, in, this, manner, throughout, christendom, and, the, outremer, the, order, in, 1150, began, generating, letters, of, credit, for, pilgrims, journeying, to, the, holy, land, pilgrims, deposited, their, valuables, with, a, local, templar, preceptory, before, embarking, received, a, document, indicating, the, value, of, their, deposit, then, used, that, document, upon, arrival, in, the, holy, land, to, retrieve, their, funds, in, an, amount, of, treasure, of, equal, value, this, innovative, arrangement, was, an, early, form, of, banking, and, may, have, been, the, first, formal, system, to, support, the, use, of, cheques, it, improved, the, safety, of, pilgrims, by, making, them, less, attractive, targets, for, thieves, and, also, contributed, to, the, templar, finances, based, on, this, mix, of, donations, and, business, dealing, the, templars, established, financial, networks, across, the, whole, of, christendom, they, acquired, large, tracts, of, land, both, in, europe, and, the, middle, east, they, bought, and, managed, farms, and, vineyards, they, built, massive, stone, cathedrals, and, castles, they, were, involved, in, manufacturing, import, and, export, they, had, their, own, fleet, of, ships, and, at, one, point, they, even, owned, the, entire, island, of, cyprus, the, order, of, the, knights, templar, arguably, qualifies, as, the, world, s, first, multinational, corporation, by, the, late, 12th, century, the, templars, were, also, politically, powerful, in, the, holy, land, the, secular, nobles, in, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, began, granting, them, castles, and, the, surrounding, lands, as, a, way, of, improving, their, defenses, against, the, growing, threat, of, the, zengids, in, syria, the, templars, were, even, allowed, to, negotiate, with, muslim, rulers, independently, of, the, feudal, lords, the, templar, castles, became, de, facto, independent, lordships, with, their, own, economic, markets, and, with, that, came, the, increase, in, political, authority, during, the, regency, that, followed, the, death, of, king, baldwin, iv, in, 1185, the, royal, castles, were, placed, into, the, custody, of, the, templars, and, hospitallers, and, the, grand, masters, of, those, two, orders, along, with, the, patriarch, of, jerusalem, also, each, had, a, key, to, the, crown, jewels, from, the, mid, 12th, century, on, the, templars, were, forced, jointly, with, the, knights, hospitaller, to, actively, involve, themselves, in, anti, muslim, military, activities, in, the, iberian, peninsula, prior, to, this, time, human, resources, were, exclusively, dedicated, towards, the, extraction, of, resources, to, send, to, the, latin, east, in, the, kingdoms, of, castile, and, le, n, they, obtained, some, major, strongholds, such, as, calatrava, la, vieja, or, coria, but, the, fragility, of, their, positions, along, the, border, was, exposed, upon, almohad, offensive, in, aragon, the, templars, seized, the, possessions, of, the, order, of, mountjoy, in, the, late, 12th, century, becoming, an, important, vanguard, force, in, the, border, while, in, portugal, they, were, charged, with, operating, some, castles, along, the, tagus, line, one, of, these, was, tomar, which, was, unsuccessfully, besieged, by, the, almohad, caliphate, in, 1190, due, to, the, economic, drain, caused, by, sending, a, third, of, their, revenues, to, the, east, templar, and, hospitaller, activities, in, the, iberian, peninsula, were, nonetheless, at, a, disadvantage, with, respect, to, the, hispanic, military, orders, which, were, able, to, entirely, devote, their, resources, to, the, region, the, details, of, the, order, s, early, military, activities, in, the, middle, east, are, vague, though, it, appears, their, first, battles, were, defeats, because, the, seljuk, turks, and, other, muslim, powers, used, different, tactics, than, those, in, europe, at, that, time, in, later, years, the, templars, adapted, to, this, and, also, became, strategic, advisors, to, the, leaders, of, the, crusader, states, the, first, recorded, battle, involving, the, knights, templar, was, in, the, town, of, teqoa, south, of, jerusalem, in, 1138, a, force, of, templars, led, by, their, grand, master, robert, de, craon, who, succeeded, hugues, de, payens, about, a, year, earlier, was, sent, to, retake, the, town, after, it, was, captured, by, muslims, they, were, initially, successful, but, the, muslims, regrouped, outside, the, town, and, were, able, to, take, it, back, from, the, templars, the, order, s, mission, also, developed, from, protecting, pilgrims, to, taking, part, in, regular, military, campaigns, early, on, and, this, is, shown, by, the, fact, that, the, first, castle, received, by, the, knights, templar, was, located, four, hundred, miles, north, of, the, pilgrim, road, from, jaffa, to, jerusalem, on, the, northern, frontier, of, the, principality, of, antioch, the, castle, of, bagras, in, the, amanus, mountains, it, may, have, been, as, early, as, 1131, and, by, 1137, at, the, latest, that, the, templars, were, given, the, mountainous, region, that, formed, the, border, of, antioch, and, cilician, armenia, and, included, the, castles, of, bagras, darbsak, and, roche, de, roissel, the, templars, were, there, when, byzantine, emperor, john, ii, komnenos, tried, to, make, the, crusaders, states, of, antioch, tripoli, and, edessa, his, vassals, between, 1137, and, 1142, templar, knights, accompanied, emperor, john, ii, with, troops, from, those, states, during, his, campaign, against, muslim, powers, in, syria, from, 1137, to, 1138, including, at, the, sieges, of, aleppo, and, shaizar, in, 1143, the, templars, also, began, taking, part, in, the, reconquista, in, iberia, at, the, request, of, the, count, of, barcelona, in, 1147, a, force, of, french, spanish, and, english, templars, left, france, to, join, the, second, crusade, led, by, king, louis, vii, at, a, meeting, held, in, paris, on, 27, april, 1147, they, were, given, permission, by, pope, eugenius, iii, to, wear, the, red, cross, on, their, uniforms, they, were, led, by, the, templar, provincial, master, in, france, everard, des, barres, who, was, later, one, of, the, ambassadors, that, king, louis, sent, to, negotiate, the, passage, of, the, crusader, army, through, the, byzantine, empire, on, its, way, to, the, holy, land, during, the, dangerous, journey, of, the, second, crusade, through, anatolia, the, templars, provided, security, to, the, rest, of, the, army, from, turkish, raids, after, the, crusaders, arrived, in, 1148, the, kings, louis, vii, conrad, iii, of, germany, and, baldwin, iii, of, jerusalem, made, the, decision, to, capture, damascus, but, their, siege, in, the, summer, of, that, year, failed, and, ended, with, the, defeat, of, the, christian, army, in, the, fall, of, 1148, some, returning, templars, took, part, in, the, successful, siege, of, tortosa, in, spain, after, which, one, fifth, of, that, city, was, given, to, the, order, robert, de, craon, died, in, january, 1149, and, was, succeeded, as, grand, master, by, everard, des, barres, one, of, the, few, leaders, at, the, siege, of, damascus, whose, reputation, was, not, damaged, by, the, event, after, the, second, crusade, zengid, forces, under, nur, ad, din, of, aleppo, attacked, the, principality, of, antioch, and, in, june, 1149, his, army, defeated, the, crusaders, at, the, battle, of, inab, where, prince, raymond, of, antioch, was, killed, king, baldwin, iii, led, reinforcements, to, the, principality, which, led, nur, to, accept, a, truce, with, antioch, and, not, advance, any, further, the, force, with, king, baldwin, included, 120, templar, knights, and, 1, 000, sergeants, and, squires, in, the, winter, of, 1149, and, 1150, king, baldwin, iii, oversaw, the, reconstruction, of, the, fortress, at, gaza, city, which, had, been, left, in, ruins, it, was, part, of, the, ring, of, castles, that, were, built, along, the, southern, border, of, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, to, protect, it, from, raids, by, the, egyptian, fatimid, caliphate, and, specifically, from, the, fatimid, troops, at, the, fortress, of, ascalon, which, by, then, was, the, last, coastal, city, in, the, levant, still, under, muslim, control, gaza, was, given, to, the, knights, templar, becoming, the, first, major, templar, castle, in, 1152, everard, stepped, down, as, the, grand, master, of, the, order, for, unknown, reasons, and, his, successor, was, bernard, de, tremelay, in, january, of, the, following, year, bernard, led, the, templars, when, king, baldwin, iii, led, a, crusader, army, to, besiege, ascalon, several, months, of, fighting, went, by, until, the, wall, of, the, city, was, breached, in, august, 1153, at, which, point, bernard, led, forty, knights, into, ascalon, but, the, rest, of, the, army, did, not, join, them, and, all, of, the, templars, were, killed, by, the, muslim, defenders, ascalon, was, captured, by, the, rest, of, the, army, several, days, later, and, bernard, was, eventually, succeeded, by, andr, de, montbard, after, the, fall, of, ascalon, the, templars, continued, operating, in, that, region, from, their, castle, at, gaza, in, june, 1154, they, attacked, abbas, ibn, abi, al, futuh, the, vizier, of, egypt, when, he, tried, to, flee, from, cairo, to, damascus, after, losing, a, power, struggle, abbas, was, killed, and, the, templars, captured, his, son, who, they, later, sent, back, to, the, fatimids, in, the, late, 1150s, the, egyptians, launched, raids, against, the, crusaders, in, the, areas, of, gaza, and, ascalon, in, the, mid, 12th, century, the, tide, began, to, turn, in, the, crusades, the, islamic, world, had, become, more, united, under, effective, leaders, such, as, saladin, and, the, reborn, sunni, regime, in, egypt, dissension, arose, among, christian, factions, in, and, concerning, the, holy, land, the, knights, templar, were, occasionally, at, odds, with, the, two, other, christian, military, orders, the, knights, hospitaller, and, the, teutonic, knights, and, decades, of, internecine, feuds, weakened, christian, positions, both, politically, and, militarily, after, the, templars, were, involved, in, several, unsuccessful, campaigns, including, the, pivotal, battle, of, hattin, jerusalem, was, recaptured, by, muslim, forces, under, saladin, in, 1187, the, holy, roman, emperor, frederick, ii, reclaimed, the, city, for, christians, in, the, sixth, crusade, of, 1229, without, templar, aid, but, only, held, it, for, a, little, more, than, a, decade, in, 1244, the, ayyubid, dynasty, together, with, khwarezmi, mercenaries, recaptured, jerusalem, and, the, city, did, not, return, to, western, control, until, 1917, when, during, world, war, i, the, british, captured, it, from, the, ottoman, empire, the, templars, were, forced, to, relocate, their, headquarters, to, other, cities, in, the, north, such, as, the, seaport, of, acre, which, they, held, for, the, next, century, it, was, lost, in, 1291, followed, by, their, last, mainland, strongholds, tortosa, tartus, in, present, day, syria, and, atlit, in, present, day, israel, their, headquarters, then, moved, to, limassol, on, the, island, of, cyprus, and, they, also, attempted, to, maintain, a, garrison, on, tiny, arwad, island, just, off, the, coast, from, tortosa, in, 1300, there, was, some, attempt, to, engage, in, coordinated, military, efforts, with, the, mongols, via, a, new, invasion, force, at, arwad, in, 1302, or, 1303, however, the, templars, lost, the, island, to, the, egyptian, mamluk, sultanate, in, the, siege, of, arwad, with, the, island, gone, the, crusaders, lost, their, last, foothold, in, the, holy, land, with, the, order, s, military, mission, now, less, important, support, for, the, organization, began, to, dwindle, the, situation, was, complex, however, since, during, the, two, hundred, years, of, their, existence, the, templars, had, become, a, part, of, daily, life, throughout, christendom, the, organization, s, templar, houses, hundreds, of, which, were, dotted, throughout, europe, and, the, near, east, gave, them, a, widespread, presence, at, the, local, level, the, templars, still, managed, many, businesses, and, many, europeans, had, daily, contact, with, the, templar, network, such, as, by, working, at, a, templar, farm, or, vineyard, or, using, the, order, as, a, bank, in, which, to, store, personal, valuables, the, order, was, still, not, subject, to, local, government, making, it, everywhere, a, state, within, a, state, its, standing, army, although, it, no, longer, had, a, well, defined, mission, could, pass, freely, through, all, borders, this, situation, heightened, tensions, with, some, european, nobility, especially, as, the, templars, were, indicating, an, interest, in, founding, their, own, monastic, state, just, as, the, teutonic, knights, had, done, in, prussia, and, the, baltic, and, the, knights, hospitaller, were, doing, in, rhodes, the, templars, were, accused, of, enabling, corruption, in, their, ranks, which, often, allowed, them, to, influence, the, legal, systems, of, europe, to, act, in, their, favor, and, gain, influence, over, local, rulers, lands, at, the, expense, of, the, rulers, in, 1305, the, new, pope, clement, v, based, in, avignon, france, sent, letters, to, both, the, templar, grand, master, jacques, de, molay, and, the, hospitaller, grand, master, fulk, de, villaret, to, discuss, the, possibility, of, merging, the, two, orders, neither, was, amenable, to, the, idea, but, pope, clement, persisted, and, in, 1306, he, invited, both, grand, masters, to, france, to, discuss, the, matter, de, molay, arrived, first, in, early, 1307, but, de, villaret, was, delayed, for, several, months, while, waiting, de, molay, and, clement, discussed, criminal, charges, that, had, been, made, two, years, earlier, by, an, ousted, templar, and, were, being, discussed, by, king, philip, iv, of, france, and, his, ministers, it, was, generally, agreed, that, the, charges, were, false, but, clement, sent, king, philip, a, written, request, for, assistance, in, the, investigation, according, to, some, historians, philip, who, was, already, deeply, in, debt, to, the, templars, from, his, war, against, england, decided, to, seize, upon, the, rumours, for, his, own, purposes, he, began, pressuring, the, church, to, take, action, against, the, order, as, a, way, of, freeing, himself, from, his, debts, at, dawn, on, friday, 13, october, 1307, a, date, that, helped, influence, the, superstition, but, not, necessarily, the, origin, of, the, popular, stories, about, friday, the, 13th, king, philip, iv, ordered, de, molay, and, scores, of, other, french, templars, to, be, simultaneously, arrested, the, arrest, warrant, started, with, the, words, dieu, n, est, pas, content, nous, avons, des, ennemis, de, la, foi, dans, le, royaume, god, is, not, pleased, we, have, enemies, of, the, faith, in, the, kingdom, claims, were, made, that, during, templar, admissions, ceremonies, recruits, were, forced, to, spit, on, the, cross, deny, christ, and, engage, in, indecent, kissing, brethren, were, also, accused, of, worshipping, idols, and, the, order, was, said, to, have, encouraged, homosexual, practices, many, of, these, allegations, contain, tropes, that, bear, similarities, to, accusations, made, against, other, persecuted, groups, such, as, jews, heretics, and, accused, witches, these, allegations, though, were, highly, politicised, without, any, real, evidence, still, the, templars, were, charged, with, numerous, other, offences, such, as, financial, corruption, fraud, and, secrecy, many, of, the, accused, confessed, to, these, charges, under, torture, even, though, the, templars, denied, being, tortured, in, their, written, confessions, and, their, confessions, even, though, obtained, under, duress, caused, a, scandal, in, paris, the, prisoners, were, coerced, to, confess, that, they, had, spat, on, the, cross, one, said, moi, raymond, de, la, f, re, 21, ans, reconnais, que, crach, trois, fois, sur, la, croix, mais, de, bouche, et, pas, de, c, ur, i, raymond, de, la, f, re, 21, years, old, admit, that, i, have, spat, three, times, on, the, cross, but, only, from, my, mouth, and, not, from, my, heart, the, templars, were, accused, of, idolatry, and, were, charged, with, worshipping, either, a, figure, known, as, baphomet, or, a, mummified, severed, head, they, recovered, amongst, other, artefacts, at, their, original, headquarters, on, the, temple, mount, some, have, theorised, that, this, head, might, have, been, believed, to, be, that, of, john, the, baptist, among, other, things, relenting, to, king, phillip, s, demands, pope, clement, then, issued, the, papal, bull, pastoralis, praeeminentiae, on, 22, november, 1307, which, instructed, all, christian, monarchs, in, europe, to, arrest, all, templars, and, seize, their, assets, clement, called, for, papal, hearings, to, determine, the, templars, guilt, or, innocence, and,

dreux, de, chevru, some, had, sufficient, legal, experience, to, defend, themselves, in, the, trials, but, in, 1310, having, appointed, the, archbishop, of, sens, philippe, de, marigny, to, lead, the, investigation, philip, blocked, this, attempt, using, the, previously, forced, confessions, to, have, dozens, of, templars, burned, at, the, stake, in, paris, with, philip, threatening, military, action, unless, the, pope, complied, with, his, wishes, clement, finally, agreed, to, disband, the, order, citing, the, public, scandal, that, had, been, generated, by, the, confessions, at, the, council, of, vienne, in, 1312, he, issued, a, series, of, papal, bulls, including, vox, in, excelso, which, officially, dissolved, the, order, and, ad, providam, which, turned, over, most, templar, assets, to, the, hospitallers, as, for, the, leaders, of, the, order, the, elderly, grand, master, jacques, de, molay, who, had, confessed, under, torture, retracted, his, confession, geoffroi, de, charney, preceptor, of, normandy, also, retracted, his, confession, and, insisted, on, his, innocence, both, men, under, pressure, from, the, king, were, declared, guilty, of, being, relapsed, heretics, and, sentenced, to, burn, alive, at, the, stake, in, paris, on, 18, march, 1314, de, molay, reportedly, remained, defiant, to, the, end, asking, to, be, tied, in, such, a, way, that, he, could, face, the, notre, dame, cathedral, and, hold, his, hands, together, in, prayer, according, to, legend, he, called, out, from, the, flames, that, both, pope, clement, and, king, philip, would, soon, meet, him, before, god, his, actual, words, were, recorded, on, the, parchment, as, follows, dieu, sait, qui, a, tort, et, a, p, ch, il, va, bient, t, arriver, malheur, ceux, qui, nous, ont, condamn, s, mort, god, knows, who, is, wrong, and, has, sinned, soon, a, calamity, will, occur, to, those, who, have, condemned, us, to, death, clement, died, only, a, month, later, and, philip, died, while, hunting, within, the, same, year, the, remaining, templars, around, europe, were, either, arrested, and, tried, under, the, papal, investigation, with, virtually, none, convicted, absorbed, into, other, catholic, military, orders, or, pensioned, off, and, allowed, to, live, out, their, days, peacefully, by, papal, decree, the, property, of, the, templars, was, transferred, to, the, knights, hospitaller, except, in, the, kingdoms, of, castile, aragon, and, portugal, portugal, was, the, first, country, in, europe, where, they, had, settled, occurring, only, two, or, three, years, after, the, order, s, foundation, in, jerusalem, and, even, having, a, presence, during, portugal, s, conception, the, portuguese, king, denis, i, refused, to, pursue, and, persecute, the, former, knights, as, had, occurred, in, some, other, states, under, the, influence, of, philip, the, crown, under, his, protection, templar, organizations, simply, changed, their, name, from, knights, templar, to, the, reconstituted, order, of, christ, and, also, a, parallel, supreme, order, of, christ, of, the, holy, see, both, are, considered, successors, to, the, knights, templar, in, september, 2001, a, document, known, as, the, chinon, parchment, dated, 17, 20, august, 1308, was, discovered, in, the, vatican, archives, by, barbara, frale, apparently, after, having, been, filed, in, the, wrong, place, in, 1628, it, is, a, record, of, the, trial, of, the, templars, and, shows, that, clement, absolved, the, templars, of, all, heresies, in, 1308, before, formally, disbanding, the, order, in, 1312, as, did, another, chinon, parchment, dated, 20, august, 1308, addressed, to, philip, iv, of, france, also, mentioning, that, all, templars, that, had, confessed, to, heresy, were, restored, to, the, sacraments, and, to, the, unity, of, the, church, this, other, chinon, parchment, has, been, well, known, to, historians, having, been, published, by, tienne, baluze, in, 1693, and, by, pierre, dupuy, in, 1751, the, current, position, of, the, roman, catholic, church, is, that, the, medieval, persecution, of, the, knights, templar, was, unjust, that, nothing, was, inherently, wrong, with, the, order, or, its, rule, and, that, pope, clement, was, pressed, into, his, actions, by, the, magnitude, of, the, public, scandal, and, by, the, dominating, influence, of, king, philip, iv, who, was, clement, s, relative, the, templars, were, organised, as, a, monastic, order, similar, to, bernard, s, cistercian, order, which, was, considered, the, first, effective, international, organization, in, europe, the, organizational, structure, had, a, strong, chain, of, authority, each, country, with, a, major, templar, presence, france, poitou, anjou, jerusalem, england, spain, portugal, italy, tripoli, antioch, hungary, and, croatia, had, a, master, of, the, order, for, the, templars, in, that, region, all, of, them, were, subject, to, the, grand, master, appointed, for, life, who, oversaw, both, the, order, s, military, efforts, in, the, east, and, their, financial, holdings, in, the, west, the, grand, master, exercised, his, authority, via, the, visitors, general, of, the, order, who, were, knights, specially, appointed, by, the, grand, master, and, convent, of, jerusalem, to, visit, the, different, provinces, correct, malpractices, introduce, new, regulations, and, resolve, important, disputes, the, visitors, general, had, the, power, to, remove, knights, from, office, and, to, suspend, the, master, of, the, province, concerned, the, central, headquarters, of, the, templars, had, several, offices, that, answered, to, the, grand, master, these, were, held, as, temporary, appointments, rather, than, for, life, the, second, in, command, of, the, order, was, the, seneschal, the, highest, ranking, military, official, was, the, marshal, while, the, preceptor, who, was, also, sometimes, called, the, commander, was, responsible, for, the, administration, and, provisions, the, draper, was, responsible, for, their, uniforms, the, treasurer, was, in, charge, of, finance, the, turcopolier, commanded, auxiliary, forces, and, the, prior, was, the, head, of, the, church, at, the, headquarters, the, headquarters, and, its, most, senior, officials, were, known, as, the, convent, and, its, role, was, to, assist, and, advise, the, grand, master, with, running, the, administration, of, the, order, no, precise, numbers, exist, but, it, is, estimated, that, at, the, order, s, peak, there, were, between, 15, 000, and, 20, 000, templars, of, whom, about, a, tenth, were, actual, knights, there, was, a, threefold, division, of, the, ranks, of, the, templars, the, noble, knights, the, non, noble, sergeants, and, the, chaplains, the, knights, wear, white, mantles, to, symbolise, their, purity, and, chastity, the, sergeants, wore, black, or, brown, all, three, classes, of, brothers, wore, the, order, s, red, cross, before, they, received, their, monastic, rule, in, 1129, at, the, council, of, troyes, the, templars, were, referred, to, only, as, knights, milites, in, latin, and, after, 1129, they, were, also, called, brothers, of, their, monastic, order, therefore, the, three, main, ranks, were, eventually, known, as, knight, brothers, sergeant, brothers, and, chaplain, brothers, knights, and, chaplains, were, referred, to, as, brothers, by, 1140, but, sergeants, were, not, full, members, of, the, order, at, first, and, this, did, not, change, until, the, 1160s, the, knights, were, the, most, visible, division, of, the, order, they, were, equipped, as, heavy, cavalry, with, three, or, four, horses, and, one, or, two, squires, squires, were, generally, not, members, of, the, order, but, were, instead, outsiders, who, were, hired, for, a, set, period, of, time, the, templars, did, not, perform, knighting, ceremonies, so, anyone, wishing, to, become, a, knight, in, the, templar, had, to, be, a, knight, already, beneath, the, knights, in, the, order, and, drawn, from, non, noble, families, were, the, sergeants, they, brought, vital, skills, and, trades, from, blacksmiths, and, builders, including, administration, of, many, of, the, order, s, european, properties, in, the, crusader, states, they, fought, alongside, the, knights, as, light, cavalry, with, a, single, horse, several, of, the, order, s, most, senior, positions, were, reserved, for, sergeants, including, the, post, of, commander, of, the, vault, of, acre, who, was, also, the, de, facto, admiral, of, the, templar, fleet, but, he, was, subordinated, to, the, order, s, preceptor, instead, of, the, marshal, indicating, that, the, templars, considered, their, ships, to, be, mainly, for, commerce, rather, than, military, purposes, from, 1139, chaplains, constituted, a, third, templar, rank, they, were, ordained, priests, who, cared, for, the, templars, spiritual, needs, these, templar, clerics, were, also, referred, to, as, priest, brothers, or, chaplain, brothers, the, templars, also, employed, lightly, armed, mercenaries, as, cavalry, in, the, 12th, century, that, were, known, as, turcopoles, the, greek, term, for, descendants, of, turks, its, meaning, has, been, interpreted, as, either, referring, to, people, of, a, mixed, muslim, christian, heritage, who, became, christians, or, members, of, the, local, population, in, syria, sometime, in, the, 13th, century, turcopole, became, a, formal, rank, held, by, templar, brothers, including, latin, christians, starting, with, founder, hugues, de, payens, the, order, s, highest, office, was, that, of, grand, master, a, position, which, was, held, for, life, though, considering, the, martial, nature, of, the, order, this, could, mean, a, very, short, tenure, all, but, two, of, the, grand, masters, died, in, office, and, several, died, during, military, campaigns, for, example, during, the, siege, of, ascalon, in, 1153, grand, master, bernard, de, tremelay, led, a, group, of, 40, templars, through, a, breach, in, the, city, walls, when, the, rest, of, the, crusader, army, did, not, follow, the, templars, including, their, grand, master, were, surrounded, and, beheaded, grand, master, g, rard, de, ridefort, was, beheaded, by, saladin, in, 1189, at, the, siege, of, acre, the, grand, master, oversaw, all, of, the, operations, of, the, order, including, both, the, military, operations, in, the, holy, land, and, eastern, europe, and, the, templars, financial, and, business, dealings, in, western, europe, some, grand, masters, also, served, as, battlefield, commanders, though, this, was, not, always, wise, several, blunders, in, de, ridefort, s, combat, leadership, contributed, to, the, devastating, defeat, at, the, battle, of, hattin, the, last, grand, master, was, jacques, de, molay, burned, at, the, stake, in, paris, in, 1314, by, order, of, king, philip, iv, bernard, de, clairvaux, and, founder, hugues, de, payens, devised, a, specific, code, of, conduct, for, the, templar, order, known, to, modern, historians, as, the, latin, rule, its, 72, clauses, laid, down, the, details, of, the, knights, way, of, life, including, the, types, of, garments, they, were, to, wear, and, how, many, horses, they, could, have, knights, were, to, take, their, meals, in, silence, eat, meat, no, more, than, three, times, per, week, and, not, have, physical, contact, of, any, kind, with, women, even, members, of, their, own, family, a, master, of, the, order, was, assigned, 4, horses, and, one, chaplain, brother, and, one, clerk, with, three, horses, and, one, sergeant, brother, with, two, horses, and, one, gentleman, valet, to, carry, his, shield, and, lance, with, one, horse, as, the, order, grew, more, guidelines, were, added, and, the, original, list, of, 72, clauses, was, expanded, to, several, hundred, in, its, final, form, the, daily, schedule, of, the, order, adhered, to, the, canonical, hours, in, the, rule, of, saint, benedict, with, communal, prayers, designated, at, specific, hours, throughout, the, day, members, unable, to, participate, must, recite, the, lord, s, prayer, at, the, same, hours, the, knights, wore, a, white, surcoat, with, a, red, cross, and, a, white, mantle, also, with, a, red, cross, the, sergeants, wore, a, black, tunic, with, a, red, cross, on, the, front, and, a, black, or, brown, mantle, the, white, mantle, was, assigned, to, the, templars, at, the, council, of, troyes, in, 1129, and, the, cross, was, most, probably, added, to, their, robes, at, the, launch, of, the, second, crusade, in, 1147, when, pope, eugenius, iii, king, louis, vii, of, france, and, many, other, notables, attended, a, meeting, of, the, french, templars, at, their, headquarters, near, paris, under, the, rule, the, knights, were, to, wear, the, white, mantle, at, all, times, they, were, even, forbidden, to, eat, or, drink, unless, wearing, it, the, red, cross, that, the, templars, wore, on, their, robes, was, a, symbol, of, martyrdom, and, to, die, in, combat, was, considered, a, great, honour, that, assured, a, place, in, heaven, there, was, a, cardinal, rule, that, the, warriors, of, the, order, should, never, surrender, unless, the, templar, flag, had, fallen, and, even, then, they, were, first, to, try, to, regroup, with, another, of, the, christian, orders, such, as, that, of, the, hospitallers, only, after, all, flags, had, fallen, were, they, allowed, to, leave, the, battlefield, this, uncompromising, principle, along, with, their, reputation, for, courage, excellent, training, and, heavy, armament, made, the, templars, one, of, the, most, feared, combat, forces, in, medieval, times, although, not, prescribed, by, the, templar, rule, it, later, became, customary, for, members, of, the, order, to, wear, long, and, prominent, beards, in, about, 1240, alberic, of, trois, fontaines, described, the, templars, as, an, order, of, bearded, brethren, while, during, the, interrogations, by, the, papal, commissioners, in, paris, in, 1310, 1311, out, of, nearly, 230, knights, and, brothers, questioned, 76, are, described, as, wearing, a, beard, in, some, cases, specified, as, being, in, the, style, of, the, templars, and, 133, are, said, to, have, shaved, off, their, beards, either, in, renunciation, of, the, order, or, because, they, had, hoped, to, escape, detection, initiation, known, as, reception, receptio, into, the, order, was, a, profound, commitment, and, involved, a, solemn, ceremony, outsiders, were, discouraged, from, attending, the, ceremony, which, aroused, the, suspicions, of, medieval, inquisitors, during, the, later, trials, new, members, had, to, willingly, sign, over, all, of, their, wealth, and, goods, to, the, order, and, vow, to, god, and, our, lady, mother, of, jesus, poverty, chastity, piety, obedience, to, the, master, of, the, order, and, to, conquer, the, holy, land, of, jerusalem, they, were, then, promised, the, bread, and, water, and, poor, clothing, of, the, house, and, much, pain, and, suffering, most, brothers, joined, for, life, although, some, were, allowed, to, join, for, a, set, period, sometimes, a, married, man, was, allowed, to, join, if, he, had, his, wife, s, permission, but, he, was, not, allowed, to, wear, the, white, mantle, with, their, military, mission, and, extensive, financial, resources, the, knights, templar, funded, a, large, number, of, building, projects, around, europe, and, the, holy, land, many, of, these, structures, are, still, standing, many, sites, also, maintain, the, name, temple, because, of, centuries, old, association, with, the, templars, for, example, some, of, the, templars, lands, in, london, were, later, rented, to, lawyers, which, led, to, the, names, of, the, temple, bar, gateway, and, the, temple, underground, station, two, of, the, four, inns, of, court, which, may, call, members, to, act, as, barristers, are, the, inner, temple, and, middle, temple, the, entire, area, known, as, temple, london, distinctive, architectural, elements, of, templar, buildings, include, the, use, of, the, image, of, two, knights, on, a, single, horse, representing, the, knights, poverty, and, round, buildings, designed, to, resemble, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, in, jerusalem, the, knights, templar, were, dismantled, in, the, rolls, of, the, catholic, church, in, 1309, following, the, suppression, of, the, order, a, number, of, knights, templar, joined, the, newly, established, order, of, christ, which, effectively, reabsorbed, the, knights, templar, and, its, properties, in, ad, 1319, especially, in, portugal, the, story, of, the, persecution, and, sudden, dissolution, of, the, secretive, yet, powerful, medieval, templars, has, drawn, many, other, groups, to, use, alleged, connections, with, them, as, a, way, of, enhancing, their, own, image, and, mystery, apart, from, the, order, of, christ, there, is, no, clear, historical, connection, between, the, knights, templar, and, any, other, modern, organization, the, earliest, of, which, emerged, publicly, in, the, 18th, century, following, the, dissolution, of, the, knights, templar, the, order, of, christ, was, erected, in, 1319, and, absorbed, many, of, the, knights, templar, into, its, ranks, along, with, knights, templar, properties, in, portugal, its, headquarters, became, a, castle, in, tomar, a, former, knights, templar, castle, the, military, order, of, christ, consider, themselves, the, successors, of, the, former, knights, templar, after, the, templars, were, abolished, on, 22, march, 1312, the, order, of, christ, was, founded, in, 1319, under, the, protection, of, the, portuguese, king, denis, who, refused, to, persecute, the, former, knights, denis, revived, the, templars, of, tomar, as, the, order, of, christ, grateful, for, their, aid, during, the, reconquista, and, in, the, reconstruction, of, portugal, after, the, wars, denis, negotiated, with, clement, s, successor, john, xxii, for, recognition, of, the, new, order, and, its, right, to, inherit, templar, assets, and, property, this, was, granted, in, the, papal, bull, ad, ea, ex, quibus, of, 14, march, 1319, the, portuguese, brought, the, order, of, christ, with, them, to, kongo, and, brazil, where, the, order, of, christ, continues, to, be, awarded, the, vatican, additionally, has, awarded, the, supreme, order, of, christ, many, temperance, organizations, named, themselves, after, the, poor, fellow, soldiers, of, christ, and, of, the, temple, of, solomon, citing, the, belief, that, the, original, knights, templar, drank, sour, milk, and, also, because, they, were, fighting, a, great, crusade, against, this, terrible, vice, of, alcohol, the, largest, of, these, the, international, order, of, good, templars, iogt, grew, throughout, the, world, after, being, started, in, the, 19th, century, and, continues, to, advocate, for, the, abstinence, from, alcohol, and, other, drugs, other, orders, in, this, tradition, include, those, of, the, templars, of, honor, and, temperance, tempel, riddare, orden, which, has, a, large,

he, produced, the, larmenius, charter, in, 1804, with, a, claim, of, succession, to, the, original, templar, order, however, there, are, doubts, to, this, claim, freemasonry, has, incorporated, the, symbols, and, rituals, of, several, medieval, military, orders, in, a, number, of, masonic, bodies, since, at, least, the, 18th, century, this, can, be, seen, in, the, red, cross, of, constantine, inspired, by, the, military, constantinian, order, the, order, of, malta, inspired, by, the, knights, hospitaller, and, the, order, of, the, temple, inspired, by, the, knights, templar, the, orders, of, malta, and, the, temple, feature, prominently, in, the, york, rite, though, some, have, claimed, a, link, between, the, historical, knights, templar, of, the, 14th, century, through, members, who, allegedly, took, refuge, in, scotland, and, aided, robert, the, bruce, this, theory, has, been, rejected, by, both, freemasons, and, historians, the, knights, templar, have, been, associated, with, legends, circulated, even, during, their, time, many, orders, such, as, the, freemasons, claimed, to, have, received, esoteric, wisdom, from, the, templars, or, were, direct, descendants, of, the, order, masonic, writers, added, their, own, speculations, in, the, 18th, century, and, further, fictional, embellishments, have, been, added, in, popular, novels, such, as, ivanhoe, foucault, s, pendulum, and, the, da, vinci, code, modern, movies, such, as, national, treasure, the, last, templar, indiana, jones, and, the, last, crusade, the, television, series, knightfall, as, well, as, video, games, such, as, broken, sword, deus, ex, assassin, s, creed, and, dante, s, inferno, the, templars, were, the, subject, of, many, conspiracy, theories, and, legends, a, legend, is, that, when, louis, xvi, was, executed, a, freemason, dipped, a, cloth, in, the, king, s, blood, and, said, jacques, de, molay, you, are, avenged, the, idea, being, that, the, king, of, france, was, responsible, for, destroying, the, knights, templar, back, then, a, theory, states, that, they, are, still, existent, and, running, a, secret, conspiracy, to, preserve, the, bloodline, of, jesus, there, have, been, speculative, popular, publications, surrounding, the, order, s, early, occupation, of, the, temple, mount, in, jerusalem, as, well, as, speculation, about, what, relics, the, templars, may, have, found, there, the, association, of, the, holy, grail, with, the, templars, has, precedents, even, in, 12th, century, fiction, wolfram, von, eschenbach, s, parzival, calls, the, knights, guarding, the, grail, kingdom, templeisen, apparently, a, conscious, fictionalization, of, the, templarii, by, molay, s, time, the, grand, master, was, presiding, over, at, least, 970, houses, including, commanderies, and, castles, in, the, east, and, west, serviced, by, a, membership, which, is, unlikely, to, have, been, less, than, 7, 000, excluding, employees, and, dependents, who, must, have, been, seven, or, eight, times, that, number, the, templars, retained, a, base, on, arwad, island, also, known, as, ruad, island, formerly, arados, off, tortosa, tartus, until, october, 1302, or, 1303, when, the, island, was, recaptured, by, the, mamluks, according, to, william, of, tyre, it, was, under, eugenius, iii, that, the, templars, received, the, right, to, wear, the, characteristic, red, cross, upon, their, tunics, symbolising, their, willingness, to, suffer, martyrdom, in, the, defence, of, the, holy, land, the, pope, conferred, on, the, templars, the, right, to, wear, a, red, cross, on, their, white, mantles, which, symbolised, their, willingness, to, suffer, martyrdom, in, defending, the, holy, land, against, the, infidel, pope, eugenius, gave, them, the, right, to, wear, a, scarlet, cross, over, their, hearts, so, that, the, sign, would, serve, triumphantly, as, a, shield, and, they, would, never, turn, away, in, the, face, of, the, infidels, the, red, blood, of, the,
