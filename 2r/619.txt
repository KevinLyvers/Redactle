mohenjo, daro, m, o, h, n, d, o, d, r, o, sindhi, lit, mound, of, the, dead, men, urdu, is, an, archaeological, site, in, larkana, district, sindh, pakistan, built, c, 2500, bce, it, was, the, largest, settlement, of, the, ancient, indus, valley, civilisation, and, one, of, the, world, s, earliest, major, cities, contemporaneous, with, the, civilizations, of, ancient, egypt, mesopotamia, minoan, crete, and, norte, chico, with, an, estimated, population, of, at, least, 40, 000, people, mohenjo, daro, prospered, for, several, centuries, but, by, c, 1700, bce, had, been, abandoned, along, with, other, large, cities, of, the, indus, valley, civilization, the, site, was, rediscovered, in, the, 1920s, significant, excavation, has, since, been, conducted, at, the, site, of, the, city, which, was, designated, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, in, 1980, the, first, site, in, south, asia, to, be, so, designated, the, site, is, currently, threatened, by, erosion, and, improper, restoration, the, city, s, original, name, is, unknown, based, on, his, analysis, of, a, mohenjo, daro, seal, iravatham, mahadevan, speculates, that, the, city, s, ancient, name, could, have, been, kukku, rma, the, city, of, the, cockerel, cock, fighting, may, have, had, ritual, and, religious, significance, for, the, city, mohenjo, daro, may, also, have, been, a, point, of, diffusion, for, the, clade, of, the, domesticated, chicken, found, in, africa, western, asia, europe, and, the, americas, mohenjo, daro, the, modern, name, for, the, site, has, been, interpreted, as, mound, of, the, dead, in, sindhi, mohenjo, daro, is, located, off, the, right, west, bank, of, the, lower, indus, river, in, larkana, district, sindh, pakistan, it, lies, on, a, pleistocene, ridge, in, the, flood, plain, of, the, indus, around, 28, kilometres, 17, mi, from, the, town, of, larkana, mohenjo, daro, was, built, in, the, 26th, century, bce, it, was, one, of, the, largest, cities, of, the, ancient, indus, valley, civilisation, also, known, as, the, harappan, civilization, which, developed, c, 3000, bce, from, the, prehistoric, indus, culture, at, its, height, the, indus, civilization, spanned, much, of, what, is, now, pakistan, and, north, india, extending, westwards, to, the, iranian, border, south, to, gujarat, in, india, and, northwards, to, an, outpost, in, bactria, with, major, urban, centers, at, harappa, mohenjo, daro, lothal, kalibangan, dholavira, and, rakhigarhi, mohenjo, daro, was, the, most, advanced, city, of, its, time, with, remarkably, sophisticated, civil, engineering, and, urban, planning, when, the, indus, civilization, went, into, sudden, decline, c, 1900, bce, mohenjo, daro, was, abandoned, the, ruins, of, the, city, remained, undocumented, for, around, 3, 700, years, until, r, d, banerji, an, officer, of, the, archaeological, survey, of, india, visited, the, site, in, 1919, 20, identifying, what, he, thought, to, be, a, buddhist, stupa, 150, 500, ce, known, to, be, there, and, finding, a, flint, scraper, which, convinced, him, of, the, site, s, antiquity, this, led, to, large, scale, excavations, of, mohenjo, daro, led, by, k, n, dikshit, in, 1924, 25, and, john, marshall, in, 1925, 26, in, the, 1930s, major, excavations, were, conducted, at, the, site, under, the, leadership, of, marshall, d, k, dikshitar, and, ernest, mackay, further, excavations, were, carried, out, in, 1945, by, mortimer, wheeler, and, his, trainee, ahmad, hasan, dani, the, last, major, series, of, excavations, were, conducted, in, 1964, and, 1965, by, george, f, dales, after, 1965, excavations, were, banned, due, to, weathering, damage, to, the, exposed, structures, and, the, only, projects, allowed, at, the, site, since, have, been, salvage, excavations, surface, surveys, and, conservation, projects, in, the, 1980s, german, and, italian, survey, groups, led, by, michael, jansen, and, maurizio, tosi, used, less, invasive, archeological, techniques, such, as, architectural, documentation, surface, surveys, and, localized, probing, to, gather, further, information, about, mohenjo, daro, a, dry, core, drilling, conducted, in, 2015, by, pakistan, s, national, fund, for, mohenjo, daro, revealed, that, the, site, is, larger, than, the, unearthed, area, mohenjo, daro, has, a, planned, layout, with, rectilinear, buildings, arranged, on, a, grid, plan, most, were, built, of, fired, and, mortared, brick, some, incorporated, sun, dried, mud, brick, and, wooden, superstructures, the, covered, area, of, mohenjo, daro, is, estimated, at, 300, hectares, the, oxford, handbook, of, cities, in, world, history, offers, a, weak, estimate, of, a, peak, population, of, around, 40, 000, the, sheer, size, of, the, city, and, its, provision, of, public, buildings, and, facilities, suggests, a, high, level, of, social, organization, the, city, is, divided, into, two, parts, the, so, called, citadel, and, the, lower, city, the, citadel, a, mud, brick, mound, around, 12, metres, 39, ft, high, is, known, to, have, supported, public, baths, a, large, residential, structure, designed, to, house, about, 5, 000, citizens, and, two, large, assembly, halls, the, city, had, a, central, marketplace, with, a, large, central, well, individual, households, or, groups, of, households, obtained, their, water, from, smaller, wells, waste, water, was, channeled, to, covered, drains, that, lined, the, major, streets, some, houses, presumably, those, of, more, prestigious, inhabitants, include, rooms, that, appear, to, have, been, set, aside, for, bathing, and, one, building, had, an, underground, furnace, known, as, a, hypocaust, possibly, for, heated, bathing, most, houses, had, inner, courtyards, with, doors, that, opened, onto, side, lanes, some, buildings, had, two, stories, in, 1950, sir, mortimer, wheeler, identified, one, large, building, in, mohenjo, daro, as, a, great, granary, certain, wall, divisions, in, its, massive, wooden, superstructure, appeared, to, be, grain, storage, bays, complete, with, air, ducts, to, dry, the, grain, according, to, wheeler, carts, would, have, brought, grain, from, the, countryside, and, unloaded, them, directly, into, the, bays, however, jonathan, mark, kenoyer, noted, the, complete, lack, of, evidence, for, grain, at, the, granary, which, he, argued, might, therefore, be, better, termed, a, great, hall, of, uncertain, function, close, to, the, great, granary, is, a, large, and, elaborate, public, bath, sometimes, called, the, great, bath, from, a, colonnaded, courtyard, steps, lead, down, to, the, brick, built, pool, which, was, waterproofed, by, a, lining, of, bitumen, the, pool, measures, 12, metres, 39, ft, long, 7, metres, 23, ft, wide, and, 2, 4, metres, 7, 9, ft, deep, it, may, have, been, used, for, religious, purification, other, large, buildings, include, a, pillared, hall, thought, to, be, an, assembly, hall, of, some, kind, and, the, so, called, college, hall, a, complex, of, buildings, comprising, 78, rooms, thought, to, have, been, a, priestly, residence, mohenjo, daro, had, no, series, of, city, walls, but, was, fortified, with, guard, towers, to, the, west, of, the, main, settlement, and, defensive, fortifications, to, the, south, considering, these, fortifications, and, the, structure, of, other, major, indus, valley, cities, like, harappa, it, is, postulated, that, mohenjo, daro, was, an, administrative, center, both, harappa, and, mohenjo, daro, share, relatively, the, same, architectural, layout, and, were, generally, not, heavily, fortified, like, other, indus, valley, sites, it, is, obvious, from, the, identical, city, layouts, of, all, indus, sites, that, there, was, some, kind, of, political, or, administrative, centrality, but, the, extent, and, functioning, of, an, administrative, center, remains, unclear, the, location, of, mohenjo, daro, was, built, in, a, relatively, short, period, of, time, with, the, water, supply, system, and, wells, being, some, of, the, first, planned, constructions, with, the, excavations, done, so, far, over, 700, wells, are, present, at, mohenjo, daro, alongside, drainage, and, bathing, systems, this, number, is, unheard, of, when, compared, to, other, civilizations, at, the, time, such, as, egypt, or, mesopotamia, and, the, quantity, of, wells, transcribes, as, one, well, for, every, three, houses, because, of, the, large, number, of, wells, it, is, believed, that, the, inhabitants, relied, solely, on, annual, rainfall, as, well, as, the, indus, river, s, course, remaining, close, to, the, site, alongside, the, wells, providing, water, for, long, periods, of, time, in, the, case, of, the, city, coming, under, siege, due, to, the, period, in, which, these, wells, were, built, and, used, it, is, likely, that, the, circular, brick, well, design, used, at, this, and, many, other, harappan, sites, are, an, invention, that, should, be, credited, to, the, indus, civilization, as, there, is, no, existing, evidence, of, this, design, from, mesopotamia, or, egypt, at, this, time, and, even, later, sewage, and, waste, water, for, buildings, at, the, site, were, disposed, of, via, a, centralized, drainage, system, that, ran, alongside, the, site, s, streets, these, drains, that, ran, alongside, the, road, were, effective, at, allowing, most, human, waste, and, sewage, to, be, disposed, of, as, the, drains, most, likely, took, the, waste, toward, the, indus, river, the, city, also, had, large, platforms, perhaps, intended, as, defense, against, flooding, according, to, a, theory, first, advanced, by, wheeler, the, city, could, have, been, flooded, and, silted, over, perhaps, six, times, and, later, rebuilt, in, the, same, location, for, some, archaeologists, it, was, believed, that, a, final, flood, that, helped, engulf, the, city, in, a, sea, of, mud, brought, about, the, abandonment, of, the, site, gregory, possehl, was, the, first, to, theorize, that, the, floods, were, caused, by, overuse, and, expansion, upon, the, land, and, that, the, mud, flood, was, not, the, reason, the, site, was, abandoned, instead, of, a, mud, flood, wiping, part, of, the, city, out, in, one, fell, swoop, possehl, coined, the, possibility, of, constant, mini, floods, throughout, the, year, paired, with, the, land, being, worn, out, by, crops, pastures, and, resources, for, bricks, and, pottery, spelled, the, downfall, of, the, site, numerous, objects, found, in, excavation, include, seated, and, standing, figures, copper, and, stone, tools, carved, seals, balance, scales, and, weights, gold, and, jasper, jewellery, and, children, s, toys, many, bronze, and, copper, pieces, such, as, figurines, and, bowls, have, been, recovered, from, the, site, showing, that, the, inhabitants, of, mohenjo, daro, understood, how, to, utilize, the, lost, wax, technique, the, furnaces, found, at, the, site, are, believed, to, have, been, used, for, copperworks, and, melting, the, metals, as, opposed, to, smelting, there, even, seems, to, be, an, entire, section, of, the, city, dedicated, to, shell, working, located, in, the, northeastern, part, of, the, site, some, of, the, most, prominent, copperworks, recovered, from, the, site, are, the, copper, tablets, which, have, examples, of, the, untranslated, indus, script, and, iconography, while, the, script, has, not, been, deciphered, yet, many, of, the, images, on, the, tablets, match, another, tablet, and, both, hold, the, same, caption, in, the, indus, language, with, the, example, given, showing, three, tablets, with, the, image, of, a, mountain, goat, and, the, inscription, on, the, back, reading, the, same, letters, for, the, three, tablets, pottery, and, terracotta, sherds, have, been, recovered, from, the, site, with, many, of, the, pots, having, deposits, of, ash, in, them, leading, archeologists, to, believe, they, were, either, used, to, hold, the, ashes, of, a, person, or, as, a, way, to, warm, up, a, home, located, in, the, site, these, heaters, or, braziers, were, ways, to, heat, the, house, while, also, being, able, to, be, utilized, in, a, manner, of, cooking, or, straining, while, others, solely, believe, they, were, used, for, heating, the, finds, from, mohenjo, daro, were, initially, deposited, in, the, lahore, museum, but, later, moved, to, the, asi, headquarters, at, new, delhi, where, a, new, central, imperial, museum, was, being, planned, for, the, new, capital, of, the, british, raj, in, which, at, least, a, selection, would, be, displayed, it, became, apparent, that, indian, independence, was, approaching, but, the, partition, of, india, was, not, anticipated, until, late, in, the, process, the, new, pakistani, authorities, requested, the, return, of, the, harappan, pieces, excavated, on, their, territory, but, the, indian, authorities, refused, eventually, an, agreement, was, reached, whereby, the, finds, totalling, some, 12, 000, objects, most, sherds, of, pottery, were, split, equally, between, the, countries, in, some, cases, this, was, taken, very, literally, with, some, necklaces, and, girdles, having, their, beads, separated, into, two, piles, in, the, case, of, the, two, most, celebrated, sculpted, figures, pakistan, asked, for, and, received, the, priest, king, while, india, retained, the, much, smaller, dancing, girl, and, also, the, pashupati, seal, most, of, the, objects, from, mohenjo, daro, retained, by, india, are, in, the, national, museum, of, india, in, new, delhi, and, those, returned, to, pakistan, in, the, national, museum, of, pakistan, in, karachi, with, many, also, in, the, museum, now, established, at, mohenjo, daro, itself, in, 1939, a, small, representative, group, of, artefacts, excavated, at, the, site, was, transferred, to, the, british, museum, by, the, director, general, of, the, archaeological, survey, of, india, discovered, by, john, marshall, in, 1931, the, idol, appears, to, mimic, certain, characteristics, that, match, the, mother, goddess, belief, common, in, many, early, near, east, civilizations, sculptures, and, figurines, depicting, women, have, been, observed, as, part, of, harappan, culture, and, religion, as, multiple, female, pieces, were, recovered, from, marshall, s, archaeological, digs, these, figures, were, not, categorized, correctly, according, to, marshall, meaning, that, where, they, were, recovered, from, the, site, is, not, actually, clear, one, of, said, figures, is, 18, 7, cm, tall, and, is, currently, on, display, at, the, national, museum, of, pakistan, in, karachi, the, fertility, and, motherhood, aspects, on, display, on, the, idols, is, represented, by, the, female, genitalia, that, is, presented, in, an, almost, exaggerated, style, as, stated, by, marshall, with, him, inferring, that, such, figurines, are, offerings, to, the, goddess, as, opposed, to, the, typical, understanding, of, them, being, idols, representing, the, goddess, s, likeness, because, of, the, figurines, being, unique, in, terms, of, hairstyles, body, proportions, as, well, as, headdresses, and, jewelry, there, are, theories, as, to, who, these, figurines, actually, represent, shereen, ratnagar, theorizes, that, because, of, their, uniqueness, and, dispersed, discovery, throughout, the, site, that, they, could, be, figurines, of, ordinary, household, women, who, commissioned, these, pieces, to, be, used, in, rituals, or, healing, ceremonies, to, help, aforementioned, individual, women, a, bronze, statuette, dubbed, the, dancing, girl, 10, 5, centimetres, 4, 1, in, high, and, about, 4, 500, years, old, was, found, in, hr, area, of, mohenjo, daro, in, 1926, it, is, now, in, the, national, museum, new, delhi, in, 1973, british, archaeologist, mortimer, wheeler, described, the, item, as, his, favorite, statuette, she, s, about, fifteen, years, old, i, should, think, not, more, but, she, stands, there, with, bangles, all, the, way, up, her, arm, and, nothing, else, on, a, girl, perfectly, for, the, moment, perfectly, confident, of, herself, and, the, world, there, s, nothing, like, her, i, think, in, the, world, john, marshall, another, archeologist, at, mohenjo, daro, described, the, figure, as, a, young, girl, her, hand, on, her, hip, in, a, half, impudent, posture, and, legs, slightly, forward, as, she, beats, time, to, the, music, with, her, legs, and, feet, the, archaeologist, gregory, possehl, said, of, the, statuette, we, may, not, be, certain, that, she, was, a, dancer, but, she, was, good, at, what, she, did, and, she, knew, it, the, statue, led, to, two, important, discoveries, about, the, civilization, first, that, they, knew, metal, blending, casting, and, other, sophisticated, methods, of, working, with, ore, and, secondly, that, entertainment, especially, dance, was, part, of, the, culture, in, 1927, a, seated, male, soapstone, figure, was, found, in, a, building, with, unusually, ornamental, brickwork, and, a, wall, niche, though, there, is, no, evidence, that, priests, or, monarchs, ruled, mohenjo, daro, archaeologists, dubbed, this, dignified, figure, a, priest, king, the, sculpture, is, 17, 5, centimetres, 6, 9, in, tall, and, shows, a, neatly, bearded, man, with, pierced, earlobes, and, a, fillet, around, his, head, possibly, all, that, is, left, of, a, once, elaborate, hairstyle, or, head, dress, his, hair, is, combed, back, he, wears, an, armband, and, a, cloak, with, drilled, trefoil, single, circle, and, double, circle, motifs, which, show, traces, of, red, his, eyes, might, have, originally, been, inlaid, a, seal, discovered, at, the, site, bears, the, image, of, a, seated, cross, legged, and, possibly, ithyphallic, figure, surrounded, by, animals, the, figure, has, been, interpreted, by, some, scholars, as, a, yogi, and, by, others, as, a, three, headed, proto, shiva, as, lord, of, animals, sir, mortimer, wheeler, was, especially, fascinated, with, this, artifact, which, he, believed, to, be, at, least, 4, 500, years, old, the, necklace, has, an, s, shaped, clasp, with, seven, strands, each, over, 4, ft, long, of, bronze, metal, bead, like, nuggets, which, connect, each, arm, of, the, s, in, filigree, each, strand, has, between, 220, and, 230, of, the, many, faceted, nuggets, and, there, are, about, 1, 600, nuggets, in, total, the, necklace, weighs, about, 250, grams, in, total, and, is, presently, held, in, a, private, collection, in, india, the, indus, valley, civilization, employed, rulers, made, of, ivory, for, measuring, length, circa, 1500, bce, the, mohenjo, daro, ruler, is, divided, into, units, corresponding, to, 34, millimetres, 1, 32, in, and, these, are, further, marked, in, decimal, subdivisions, with, great, accuracy, to, within, 0, 13, mm, 0, 005, in, a, ruler, found, at, lothal, 2400, bce, is, calibrated, to, about, 1, 6, mm, 1, 16, in, the, decimal, subdivision, on, the, ruler, is, noteworthy, as, it, predates, the, modern, metric, system, by, 3000, years, or, more, the, base, unit, used, was, known, as, the, angula, finger, and, is, about, 17, mm, a, piece, of, shell, found, in, mackay, s, excavation, is, very, precisely, incised, with, lines, spaced, 6, 7, mm, 0, 264, in, apart, ancient, bricks, found, throughout, the, region, have, dimensions, that, correspond, to, these, units, an, initial, agreement, to, fund, restoration, was, agreed, through, the, united, nations, educational, scientific, and, cultural, organization, unesco, in, paris, on, 27, may, 1980, contributions, were, made, by, a, number, of, other, countries, to, the, project, preservation, work, for, mohenjo, daro, was, suspended, in,
