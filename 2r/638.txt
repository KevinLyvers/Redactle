the, history, of, opera, has, a, relatively, short, duration, within, the, context, of, the, history, of, music, in, general, it, appeared, in, 1597, when, the, first, opera, dafne, by, jacopo, peri, was, created, since, then, it, has, developed, parallel, to, the, various, musical, currents, that, have, followed, one, another, over, time, up, to, the, present, day, generally, linked, to, the, current, concept, of, classical, music, opera, from, the, latin, opera, plural, of, opus, work, is, a, musical, genre, that, combines, symphonic, music, usually, performed, by, an, orchestra, and, a, written, dramatic, text, expressed, in, the, form, of, a, libretto, interpreted, vocally, by, singers, of, different, tessitura, tenor, baritone, and, bass, for, the, male, register, and, soprano, mezzo, soprano, and, contralto, for, the, female, in, addition, to, the, so, called, white, voices, those, of, children, or, in, falsetto, castrato, countertenor, generally, the, musical, work, contains, overtures, interludes, and, musical, accompaniments, while, the, sung, part, can, be, in, choir, or, solo, duet, trio, or, various, combinations, in, different, structures, such, as, recitative, or, aria, there, are, various, genres, such, as, classical, opera, chamber, opera, operetta, musical, singspiel, and, zarzuela, on, the, other, hand, as, in, theater, there, is, dramatic, opera, opera, seria, and, comic, opera, opera, buffa, as, well, as, a, hybrid, between, the, two, the, dramma, giocoso, as, a, multidisciplinary, genre, opera, brings, together, music, singing, dance, theater, scenography, performance, costumes, makeup, hairdressing, and, other, artistic, disciplines, it, is, therefore, a, work, of, collective, creation, which, essentially, starts, from, a, librettist, and, a, composer, and, where, the, vocal, performers, have, a, primordial, role, but, where, the, musicians, and, the, conductor, the, dancers, the, creators, of, the, sets, and, costumes, and, many, other, figures, are, equally, essential, on, the, other, hand, it, is, a, social, event, so, it, has, no, reason, to, exist, without, an, audience, to, witness, the, show, for, this, very, reason, it, has, been, over, time, a, reflection, of, the, various, currents, of, thought, political, and, philosophical, religious, and, moral, aesthetic, and, cultural, peculiar, to, the, society, where, the, plays, were, produced, opera, was, born, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, as, an, initiative, of, a, circle, of, scholars, the, florentine, camerata, who, discovering, that, ancient, greek, theater, was, sung, had, the, idea, of, setting, dramatic, texts, to, music, thus, jacopo, peri, created, dafne, 1597, followed, by, euridice, 1600, by, the, same, author, in, 1607, claudio, monteverdi, composed, la, favola, d, orfeo, where, he, added, a, musical, introduction, that, he, called, sinfonia, and, divided, the, sung, parts, into, arias, giving, structure, to, the, modern, opera, the, subsequent, evolution, of, opera, has, run, parallel, to, the, various, musical, currents, that, have, followed, one, another, over, time, between, the, 17th, century, and, the, first, half, of, the, 18th, it, was, framed, by, the, baroque, a, period, in, which, cultured, music, was, reserved, for, the, social, elites, but, which, produced, new, and, rich, musical, forms, and, which, saw, the, establishment, of, a, language, of, its, own, for, opera, which, was, gaining, richness, and, complexity, not, only, in, compositional, and, vocal, methods, but, also, in, theatrical, and, scenographic, production, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, saw, the, classicism, a, period, of, great, creativity, marked, by, the, serenity, and, harmony, of, its, compositions, with, great, figures, such, as, mozart, and, beethoven, the, 19th, century, was, marked, by, the, romanticism, characterized, by, the, individuality, of, the, composer, already, considered, an, enlightened, genius, and, increasingly, revered, as, were, the, greatest, vocal, figures, of, singing, who, became, stars, in, a, society, where, the, bourgeoisie, relegated, the, aristocracy, in, social, preeminence, this, century, saw, the, emergence, of, the, musical, variants, of, numerous, nations, with, hardly, any, musical, tradition, until, then, in, what, came, to, be, called, musical, nationalism, the, century, closed, with, currents, such, as, french, impressionism, and, italian, verismo, in, the, 20th, century, opera, like, the, rest, of, music, and, the, arts, in, general, entered, the, avant, garde, a, new, way, of, conceiving, artistic, creation, in, which, new, compositional, methods, and, techniques, emerged, which, were, expressed, in, a, great, variety, of, styles, at, a, time, of, greater, diffusion, of, the, media, that, allowed, reaching, a, wider, audience, through, various, channels, not, only, in, person, radio, television, and, in, which, the, wide, musical, repertoire, of, previous, periods, was, still, valued, which, remained, in, force, in, the, main, opera, houses, of, the, world, during, the, course, of, history, within, opera, there, have, been, differences, of, opinion, as, to, which, of, its, components, was, more, important, the, music, or, the, text, or, even, whether, the, importance, lay, in, the, singing, and, virtuosity, of, the, performers, a, phenomenon, that, gave, rise, to, bel, canto, and, to, the, appearance, of, figures, such, as, the, diva, or, prima, donna, from, its, beginnings, until, the, consolidation, of, classicism, the, text, enjoyed, greater, importance, always, linked, to, the, visual, spectacle, the, lavish, decorations, and, the, complex, baroque, scenographies, claudio, monteverdi, said, in, this, respect, the, word, must, be, decisive, it, must, direct, the, harmony, not, serve, it, however, since, the, reform, carried, out, by, gluck, and, the, appearance, of, great, geniuses, such, as, mozart, music, as, the, main, component, of, opera, became, more, and, more, important, mozart, himself, once, commented, poetry, must, be, the, obedient, servant, of, music, other, authors, such, as, richard, wagner, sought, to, bring, together, all, the, arts, in, a, single, creation, which, he, called, total, work, of, art, gesamtkunstwerk, opera, has, its, roots, in, the, various, forms, of, sung, or, musical, theater, that, have, been, produced, throughout, history, all, over, the, world, dramatic, representation, as, well, as, singing, music, dance, and, other, artistic, manifestations, are, forms, of, expression, consubstantial, to, human, beings, practiced, since, prehistoric, times, in, ancient, greece, the, theater, was, one, of, the, favorite, spectacles, of, society, there, the, main, dramatic, genres, comedy, and, tragedy, were, born, and, the, foundations, of, scenography, and, interpretation, were, laid, from, various, testimonies, it, is, known, that, the, dramatic, representations, were, sung, and, accompanied, by, music, although, nowadays, hardly, any, traces, of, greek, music, are, preserved, the, main, playwrights, of, the, time, aeschylus, sophocles, and, euripides, laid, the, foundations, of, dramatic, art, whose, influence, continues, to, this, day, during, the, middle, ages, music, and, theater, were, also, closely, related, they, were, works, of, religious, character, of, two, types, liturgical, dramas, to, be, performed, in, the, churches, celebrated, in, latin, and, the, so, called, mystery, play, theatrical, pieces, of, popular, character, that, were, represented, in, the, porches, of, the, churches, in, vernacular, language, these, plays, alternated, spoken, and, sung, parts, generally, in, choir, and, were, accompanied, by, instrumental, music, and, sometimes, popular, dances, in, japan, the, n, theater, emerged, in, medieval, times, a, type, of, lyrical, musical, drama, in, prose, or, verse, with, a, historical, or, mythological, theme, the, narration, was, recited, by, a, choir, while, the, main, actors, performed, gesturally, in, rhythmic, movements, the, representation, was, performed, by, three, actors, together, with, a, choir, of, eight, singers, a, flute, player, and, three, drummers, in, china, the, so, called, chinese, opera, was, developed, a, type, of, sung, theater, of, ritual, character, where, the, music, does, not, accompany, the, text, but, serves, only, to, create, atmosphere, in, the, renaissance, several, musical, vocal, genres, emerged, such, as, the, madrigal, oratorio, intermedio, and, ballet, de, cour, which, paved, the, way, for, the, birth, of, opera, the, most, immediate, was, the, intermedio, italian, intermezzo, interludes, that, were, interspersed, between, the, various, acts, of, a, theatrical, work, which, brought, together, song, dance, instrumental, music, and, scenographic, effects, with, plots, based, on, greco, roman, mythology, allegories, or, pastoral, scenes, its, main, production, center, was, the, medici, florence, where, opera, was, born, shortly, afterwards, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, in, florence, a, circle, of, scholars, sponsored, by, count, giovanni, de, bardi, created, a, society, called, florentine, camerata, aimed, to, study, and, critical, discussion, of, the, arts, especially, drama, and, music, one, of, its, scholars, was, vincenzo, galilei, father, of, the, scientist, galileo, a, celebrated, hellenist, and, musicologist, author, of, a, method, of, tablature, for, lute, and, composer, of, madrigals, and, recitatives, in, the, course, of, their, studies, of, ancient, greek, theater, they, found, that, in, greek, theatrical, performances, the, text, was, sung, to, individual, voices, this, idea, struck, them, since, nothing, like, it, existed, at, the, time, at, a, time, when, almost, all, sung, music, was, choral, polyphony, and, in, cases, of, individual, voices, occurred, only, in, the, religious, sphere, they, then, had, the, idea, of, setting, dramatic, texts, of, a, profane, nature, to, music, which, germinated, in, opera, opera, in, musica, was, the, name, given, to, it, by, the, camerata, galilei, was, the, main, advocate, of, a, single, melodic, line, the, monody, as, opposed, to, polyphony, which, he, considered, to, generate, an, incoherent, musical, discourse, a, theory, he, expounded, in, dialogo, della, musica, antica, et, della, moderna, 1581, another, of, the, camerata, s, scholars, girolamo, mei, who, was, the, one, who, mainly, investigated, greek, theater, pointed, out, the, emotional, affect, that, individual, singing, generated, in, the, audience, in, greek, theatrical, performances, de, modis, musicis, antiquorum, 1573, thus, one, of, the, members, of, the, camerata, the, composer, jacopo, peri, created, dafne, 1597, with, libretto, by, ottavio, rinuccini, based, on, the, myth, of, apollo, and, dafne, with, a, prologue, and, six, scenes, of, this, work, only, the, libretto, and, small, fragments, of, the, music, are, preserved, peri, who, was, also, a, singer, represented, apollo, this, was, followed, in, 1600, by, euridice, by, the, same, authors, the, first, surviving, complete, opera, on, the, myth, of, orpheus, and, eurydice, it, was, composed, on, the, occasion, of, the, wedding, between, henry, iv, of, france, and, maria, de, medici, celebrated, in, florence, in, 1600, peri, played, orpheus, another, member, of, the, camerata, giulio, caccini, composed, in, 1602, euridice, with, the, same, libretto, by, rinuccini, as, his, namesake, of, two, years, earlier, with, prologue, and, three, acts, he, was, the, author, of, the, first, theoretical, treatise, on, the, new, genre, le, nuove, musiche, 1602, his, daughter, francesca, caccini, was, a, singer, and, composer, the, first, woman, to, compose, an, opera, la, liberazione, di, ruggiero, dall, isola, d, alcina, 1625, one, of, the, main, novelties, of, this, new, form, of, artistic, expression, was, its, secularism, at, a, time, when, artistic, and, musical, production, was, mostly, of, a, religious, nature, another, was, the, appearance, of, monody, the, singing, of, a, single, voice, as, opposed, to, medieval, and, renaissance, polyphony, it, was, a, vocal, line, accompanied, by, a, basso, continuo, of, harpsichord, or, lute, thus, the, first, operas, had, parts, sung, by, soloists, and, parts, spoken, or, declaimed, in, monody, known, as, stile, rappresentativo, these, first, experiences, were, a, great, success, especially, among, the, nobility, the, medici, became, patrons, of, these, performances, and, from, florence, they, spread, to, the, rest, of, italy, the, house, of, gonzaga, of, mantua, then, commissioned, the, famous, madrigal, composer, claudio, monteverdi, to, write, an, opera, la, favola, d, orfeo, in, 1607, with, libretto, by, alessandro, striggio, an, ambitious, work, composed, for, orchestra, of, forty, three, instruments, including, two, organs, with, prologue, and, five, acts, in, this, work, libretti, were, printed, for, the, first, time, so, that, the, audience, could, follow, the, performance, monteverdi, added, a, musical, introduction, which, he, called, symphony, and, divided, the, sung, parts, into, arias, giving, structure, to, modern, opera, these, arias, alternated, with, the, recitative, a, musical, line, that, included, spoken, and, sung, parts, he, also, introduced, the, ritornello, an, instrumental, stanza, repeated, between, the, five, acts, as, for, the, voices, although, he, left, some, parts, in, polyphony, he, differentiated, the, main, solo, voices, orpheus, was, tenor, eurydice, soprano, and, charon, bass, in, 1608, monteverdi, premiered, l, arianna, with, libretto, by, rinuccini, of, which, the, music, has, not, been, preserved, except, for, one, fragment, the, lamento, d, arianna, during, the, first, decades, of, the, 17th, century, the, opera, gradually, spread, in, 1608, was, premiered, in, mantua, la, dafne, again, with, rinuccini, s, libretto, this, time, set, to, music, by, marco, da, gagliano, in, rome, rappresentazione, di, anima, e, di, corpo, by, emilio, de, cavalieri, a, melodramma, spirituale, that, is, often, considered, a, precedent, of, opera, was, premiered, in, 1600, and, which, pointed, out, some, of, the, variants, of, roman, opera, as, opposed, to, florentine, opera, greater, presence, of, sacred, themes, the, presence, of, allegorical, characters, and, greater, use, of, choirs, pope, paul, v, and, the, barberini, family, sponsored, the, new, genre, the, barberini, built, an, auditorium, for, 3000, people, in, their, palace, they, also, promoted, the, creation, of, a, school, of, operatists, among, whom, stefano, landi, author, of, la, morte, d, orfeo, 1619, which, as, a, novelty, introduced, comic, elements, religious, themes, were, also, introduced, as, in, il, sant, alessio, 1631, by, landi, with, libretto, by, cardinal, giulio, rospigliosi, future, pope, clement, ix, in, this, work, landi, introduced, the, fast, slow, fast, structure, called, italian, overture, which, would, be, widely, used, ever, since, another, introducer, of, the, monodic, style, in, rome, was, paolo, quagliati, who, adapted, old, madrigals, of, his, in, opera, form, il, carro, di, fedelt, d, amore, 1606, la, sfera, armoniosa, 1623, in, the, roman, school, also, stood, out, luigi, rossi, who, worked, for, the, barberini, in, 1642, he, premiered, in, their, theater, il, palazzo, incantato, a, sumptuous, production, that, was, a, great, success, when, in, 1644, the, barberini, had, to, go, into, exile, in, paris, rossi, accompanied, them, and, obtained, the, protection, of, cardinal, mazarin, thus, helping, to, introduce, opera, in, france, there, he, composed, his, orfeo, 1647, with, prologue, and, three, acts, a, large, production, that, featured, numerous, visual, effects, mention, should, also, be, made, of, domenico, mazzocchi, impresario, as, well, as, composer, who, initiated, the, hiring, of, singers, for, opera, he, was, the, author, of, la, catena, d, adone, 1626, another,

baroque, it, developed, during, the, 17th, century, it, was, a, time, of, great, disputes, in, the, political, and, religious, fields, in, which, a, division, emerged, between, the, catholic, counter, reformationist, countries, where, the, absolutist, state, was, entrenched, and, the, protestant, countries, of, a, more, parliamentary, sign, baroque, music, was, generally, characterized, by, contrast, violent, chords, moving, volumes, exaggerated, ornamentation, varied, and, contrasted, structure, despite, this, not, all, baroque, music, is, exaggerated, bach, is, an, author, of, harmonic, balance, vivaldi, creates, simple, and, radiant, melodies, the, basis, of, baroque, music, is, serene, and, balanced, with, ornamentation, arpeggios, mordents, tremolos, sonorous, arabesques, that, are, the, salt, of, the, baroque, musician, it, was, also, at, this, time, that, the, tempos, were, introduced, to, regulate, the, speed, of, interpretation, long, adagio, andante, allegro, and, presto, or, the, intensity, forte, and, piano, during, this, period, the, main, musical, centers, were, in, the, monarchic, courts, aristocratic, circles, and, episcopal, sees, the, instrumentation, reached, heights, of, great, perfection, especially, in, the, violin, the, baroque, orchestra, was, small, usually, only, a, chamber, orchestra, or, about, forty, instruments, at, most, most, were, string, instruments, plus, some, oboes, flutes, bassoons, and, trumpets, alongside, these, was, a, section, for, basso, continuo, usually, composed, of, one, or, two, harpsichords, with, accompaniment, by, cello, double, bass, lute, viola, or, theorbo, baroque, opera, was, noted, for, its, complicated, and, ornate, scenography, with, sudden, changes, and, complicated, lighting, and, sensory, effects, numerous, sets, were, used, up, to, fifteen, or, twenty, changes, of, scenery, per, performance, there, began, a, taste, for, solo, voices, mainly, treble, tenor, soprano, which, led, in, parallel, to, the, phenomenon, of, the, castrati, the, latter, were, children, who, excelled, in, singing, and, who, were, castrated, before, entering, puberty, so, that, their, voice, would, not, change, thus, as, adults, they, maintained, a, high, pitched, voice, close, to, the, female, one, but, more, powerful, flexible, and, penetrating, singing, in, vibrato, was, also, introduced, consisting, of, fluctuations, in, timbre, pitch, and, intensity, which, provided, greater, emotionality, to, the, interpretation, in, the, first, half, of, the, 17th, century, the, rules, of, operatic, librettos, were, established, which, would, undergo, few, variations, until, almost, the, 20th, century, simple, dialogues, and, conventional, language, stanzas, of, rigorous, forms, distinction, between, recitative, declaimed, parts, that, develop, the, action, and, number, or, closed, piece, ornamental, parts, in, the, form, of, aria, duet, choir, or, other, formats, in, the, middle, decades, of, the, 17th, century, the, major, opera, producing, center, was, venice, the, first, place, where, music, was, detached, from, religious, or, aristocratic, protection, to, be, performed, in, public, places, in, 1637, the, teatro, san, cassiano, was, founded, demolished, in, 1812, the, first, opera, center, in, the, world, located, in, a, palace, that, belonged, to, the, tron, family, the, first, opera, performed, was, l, andromeda, by, francesco, mannelli, the, theater, was, founded, by, domenico, mazzocchi, who, after, losing, papal, favor, moved, from, rome, to, the, venetian, city, as, opera, became, a, business, it, began, to, depend, more, and, more, on, the, tastes, of, the, public, since, by, its, attendance, at, performances, it, could, favor, a, certain, compositional, line, or, relegate, it, to, oblivion, one, of, the, first, consequences, was, that, the, public, showed, more, and, more, taste, for, high, pitched, voices, those, of, tenors, sopranos, and, castrati, while, the, use, of, choirs, and, large, orchestras, declined, since, an, accompaniment, of, few, instruments, was, preferred, between, ten, and, fifteen, generally, as, the, genre, became, more, popular, more, comic, elements, were, introduced, and, the, texts, were, simplified, to, the, point, where, especially, in, the, arias, the, interpretation, was, more, important, than, the, words, that, were, expressed, after, the, san, cassiano, the, opening, of, new, theaters, flourished, in, venice, santi, giovanni, e, paolo, 1639, san, mois, 1640, novissimo, 1641, san, samuele, 1655, and, santi, apostoli, 1649, it, was, in, these, theaters, that, the, piazza, like, layout, surrounded, by, boxes, typical, of, opera, houses, began, in, venice, the, concept, of, bel, canto, emerged, which, became, popular, especially, in, the, first, half, of, the, 18th, century, and, again, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, in, italy, it, is, a, vocal, technique, of, difficult, execution, consisting, of, maintaining, a, uniform, tone, passing, from, one, musical, phrase, to, another, without, pauses, in, a, sustained, legato, that, requires, a, powerful, timbre, and, harmonic, articulation, the, main, interpreters, of, bel, canto, were, the, castrati, and, the, prima, donna, sopranos, on, the, other, hand, at, this, time, emerged, the, arioso, an, intermediate, song, between, the, recitative, and, the, aria, which, over, time, became, closed, numbers, with, a, tendency, to, ornamentation, likewise, from, the, years, 1630, 1640, the, ensemble, the, conjunction, of, voices, in, different, numbers, was, gaining, relevance, duet, trio, quartet, quintet, sextet, septet, and, octet, the, venetian, opera, was, particularly, influenced, by, the, spanish, theater, of, the, so, called, golden, age, especially, lope, de, vega, perceptible, in, the, plot, confluence, between, fantasy, and, reality, a, path, started, with, don, quixote, by, cervantes, the, abandonment, of, the, aristotelian, units, the, coexistence, of, comic, and, tragic, characters, the, relationships, between, lords, and, servants, the, taste, for, entanglement, and,

showing, the, more, virtuous, side, of, the, heroes, of, old, age, generally, the, action, was, centered, on, the, recitatives, and, the, arias, were, left, for, lyrical, incursions, by, the, singers,

in, the, intermissions, of, the, plays, which, gradually, gained, success, until, they, became, separate, works, a, good, example, was, la, serva, padrona, by, pergolesi, 1733, from, then, on, these, intermezzi, became, independent, and, became, shows, of, their, own, the, opera, buffa, was, of, comic, genre, intended, for, a, more, popular, audience, influenced, by, the, commedia, dell, arte, it,

buffa, a, type, of, rapid, syllabic, declamation, called, parlando, was, characteristic, also, frequent, was, the, presence, of, stuttering, yawning, or, sneezing, the, music, generally, stringed, was, simple, of, small, orchestras, although, over, time, it, would, be, equated, with, that, of, opera, seria, eventually, both, genres, tended, to, merge, with, the, appearance, of, the, semi, serious, opera, or, dramma, giocoso, some, of, the, characteristic, elements, of, the, opera, buffa, were, the, use, of, the, recitative, accompagnato, greater, use, of, choir, and, ensembles, and, the, use, of, the, cavatina, and, the, aria, con, pertichini, a, modality, based, on, an, aria, generally, da, capo, to, which, were, added, comments, in, recitative, by, characters, who, watched, the, scene, from, outside, generating, a, form, of, ensemble, the, introduzione, and, the, finale, scenes, that, usually, brought, together, all, the, characters, of, the, work, singing, in, ensemble, also, became, more, relevant, in, the, field, of, opera, seria, a, unique, phenomenon, in, the, history, of, opera, took, place, in, this, period, librettists, were, more, relevant, than, composers, especially, two, apostolo, zeno, and, pietro, metastasio, zeno, was, a, venetian, historian, and, librarian, who, after, dabbling, in, the, field, of, opera, libretti, was, always, eager, to, have, them, considered, a, literary, genre, of, the, first, rank, in, 1718, he, replaced, silvio, stampiglia, as, imperial, poet, of, charles, vi, for, whom, he, was, also, imperial, historiographer, he, introduced, historical, themes, into, opera, and, in, his, plots, always, incorporated, a, code, of, honor, to, serve, as, an, example, for, the, public, he, wrote, thirty, five, librettos, some, of, them, in, collaboration, with, pietro, pariati, which, were, set, to, music, by, composers, such, as, albinoni, caldara, gasparini, scarlatti, and, h, ndel, a, generation, younger, metastasio, was, directly, influenced, by, zeno, whom, he, replaced, as, imperial, poet, in, a, fifty, year, career, he, wrote, twenty, seven, librettos, that, were, set, to, music, in, some, one, hundred, operas, he, was, a, great, reformer, of, operatic, writing, to, the, point, that, one, often, speaks, of, metastasian, opera, for, his, works, his, librettos, were, elegant, and, sophisticated, and, he, gave, greater, prominence, to, the, soloists, zeno, and, metastasio, introduced, the, so, called, doctrine, of, the, affections, whereby, every, emotion, love, hate, sadness, hope, despair, was, expressed, by, a, certain, musical, form, aria, chorale, instrumental, movement, venice, remained, one, of, the, main, operatic, centers, antonio, vivaldi, the, main, representative, of, the, italian, late, baroque, school, stood, out, he, was, chapel, master, of, the, ospedale, della, piet, in, venice, where, he, was, able, to, rely, on, the, orphans, of, the, hospice, to, form, a, large, orchestra,

consolidation, of, capitalism, which, would, have, a, response, in, marxism, and, the, class, struggle, in, the, field, of, art, and, music, an, evolutionary, dynamic, of, styles, began, to, follow, one, another, chronologically, with, increasing, speed, culminating, in, the, 20th, century, with, an, atomization, of, styles, and, currents, that, coexist, and, oppose, influence, and, confront, each, other, music, was, a, reflection, on, numerous, occasions, of, these, artistic, movements, which, occurred, not, only, in, art, and, music, but, also, in, literature, theater, dance, and, other, artistic, manifestations, in, music, the, most, outstanding, aspect, was, the, progressive, independence, of, composers, and, performers, from, the, patronage, of, the, aristocracy, and, the, church, the, new, addressee, was, the, public, preferably, the, bourgeoisie, but, also, the, common, people, in, theaters, and, concert, halls, the, new, situation, gave, the, musician, greater, creative, freedom, but, also, deprived, him, of, the, previous, security, provided, by, his, patrons, as, he, was, subject, to, the, ups, and, downs, of, success, or, failure, opera, developed, in, this, century, in, an, increasingly, grandiloquent, manner, on, large, stages, and, with, large, scenographic, stagings, with, larger, and, larger, orchestras, performing, more, powerful, and, sonorous, music, this, forced, vocal, performers, to, increase, their, singing, power, to, fill, the, entire, theater, and, to, be, heard, above, the, instruments, to, this, end, new, techniques, of, voice, enhancement, appeared, and, new, registers, emerged, such, as, the, robust, tenor, the, tenore, di, forza, and, the, dramatic, soprano, in, the, second, half, of, this, century, the, operetta, was, established, as, a, minor, genre, of, opera, based, on, a, theatrical, piece, with, dances, and, songs, alternating, with, dialogues, with, light, music, of, popular, taste, it, became, established, in, france, as, a, derivation, of, op, ra, comique, in, small, theaters, such, as, the, bouffes, parisiens, sponsored, by, the, composer, jacques, offenbach, it, was, also, well, established, in, vienna, where, it, was, nourished, by, the, traditional, german, singspiel, this, type, of, work, gave, rise, to, the, current, musical, during, this, century, numerous, innovations, and, advances, were, introduced, in, the, scenographic, field, especially, in, lighting, in, 1822, the, gas, light, was, introduced, for, the, first, time, at, the, paris, opera, in, the, performance, of, aladin, ou, la, lampe, merveilleuse, by, nicolas, isouard, in, 1849, the, electric, light, was, premiered, in, le, proph, te, by, giacomo, meyerbeer, one, of, the, best, scenographers, was, pierre, luc, charles, cic, ri, creator, of, large, and, ingenious, sets, with, the, latest, technologies, of, the, time, as, well, as, special, effects, fireworks, and, other, novelties, he, invented, a, moving, panorama, composed, of, a, curtain, that, was, rolled, up, on, a, cylinder, and, when, unrolled, produced, movement, effects, on, the, scene, on, the, other, hand, the, pioneer, of, photography, louis, daguerre, introduced, the, double, painted, sets, which, thanks, to, lighting, effects, caused, a, sensation, of, movement, the, most, prestigious, theater, was, along, with, la, scala, in, milan, the, paris, opera, which, after, various, venues, was, located, in, 1821, in, the, hall, on, rue, le, peletier, where, it, enjoyed, the, golden, age, of, the, grand, op, ra, destroyed, by, fire, in, 1873, two, years, later, the, op, ra, garnier, designed, by, architect, charles, garnier, was, inaugurated, with, seating, for, 2600, spectators, romantic, music, survived, for, almost, the, entire, century, until, the, appearance, of, the, musical, avant, garde, of, the, 20th, century, it, was, characterized, as, in, the, rest, of, the, arts, by, the, predominance, of, feeling, and, passion, of, the, subjectivity, and, emotionality, of, the, artist, with, exaltation, of, national, and, popular, music, the, orchestra, was, enlarged, to, fully, satisfy, the, expressiveness, of, the, artist, the, new, feelings, that, nested, in, him, the, sublime, the, pathetic, romanticism, emphasized, individuality, irrationality, as, a, reaction, to, enlightened, reason, the, protagonism, was, won, by, the, human, being, and, his, heroic, actions, as, opposed, to, mythological, gods, and, baroque, deus, ex, machina, interventions, a, new, interest, in, nature, and, its, sounds, arose, which, were, imitated, in, numerous, compositions, storms, fire, avalanches, volcanic, eruptions, etc, the, ideal, instrument, to, reflect, the, romantic, passions, was, the, piano, from, which, numerous, virtuosos, emerged, such, as, franz, liszt, and, fr, d, ric, chopin, alongside, it, were, gaining, importance, the, percussion, instruments, especially, timpani, and, cymbals, in, search, of, more, expressive, sounds, new, instruments, were, also, incorporated, to, the, orchestra, such, as, the, harp, the, piccolo, the, contrabassoon, and, the, english, horn, at, the, same, time, movements, that, expressed, more, emotions, were, sought, such, as, prestissimo, molto, agitato, or, adagio, lamentoso, the, figure, of, the, conductor, became, more, important, and, many, composers, were, at, the, same, time, conductors, one, of, them, carl, maria, von, weber, introduced, the, baton, for, conducting, this, period, saw, a, remarkable, development, of, opera, especially, in, italy, where, it, was, the, golden, age, of, bel, canto, it, stood, out, for, the, brilliance, of, its, voices, the, coloratura, the, ornamentation, gaining, importance, the, role, of, the, soprano, while, for, the, tenor, it, became, fashionable, from, 1840, the, do, de, pecho, romantic, opera, had, two, aspects, the, comic, or, buffa, and, the, dramatic, based, on, the, great, romantic, literary, dramas, the, difference, between, recitative, and, aria, was, diluted, predominating, the, cantabile, melody, over, the, rest, of, the, elements, on, the, other, hand, the, romantic, opera, stood, out, for, its, folkloristic, taste, and, the, use, of, themes, based, on, the, history, and, mythology, of, the, country, a, new, taste, for, so, called, gothic, themes, also, emerged, which, in, opera, gave, a, variant, called, morte, death, provoked, by, the, grim, events, of, the, french, revolution, a, good, example, would, be, lucia, di, lammermoor, by, gaetano, donizetti, in, this, period, the, librettos, varied, in, themes, and, plots, but, had, few, structural, transformations, so, that, conventional, language, and, the, simplification, of, dialogues, and, situations, predominated, as, in, previous, eras, one, of, the, most, successful, novelists, of, the, period, was, walter, scott, nineteen, of, whose, novels, were, adapted, into, sixty, three, operas, another, was, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, whose, texts, were, set, to, music, in, 122, operas, twenty, of, them, on, his, work, faust, he, also, personally, wrote, eight, librettos, for, singspiel, fifty, six, operas, were, also, composed, on, texts, by, friedrich, von, schiller, other, writers, who, also, inspired, numerous, operas, were, victor, hugo, and, aleksandr, pushkin, the, germ, of, romantic, opera, arose, in, france, where, opera, seria, and, opera, buffa, tended, to, converge, at, the, same, time, that, the, gluckian, reform, was, coming, to, fruition, the, recitatives, with, harpsichord, were, discarded, and, became, orchestral, the, plots, based, on, the, greco, latin, classics, were, abandoned, to, set, the, new, romantic, dramas, to, music, with, a, preference, for, medieval, settings, bards, troubadours, or, popular, legends, at, this, time, the, so, called, grand, op, ra, developed, in, france, characterized, by, the, exuberance, of, its, large, stage, productions, with, large, orchestras, and, numerous, characters, with, generally, historical, and, epic, themes, aimed, at, a, bourgeois, audience, the, op, ra, comique, genre, also, continued, which, in, 1805, was, established, at, the, salle, feydeau, and, in, 1840, at, the, salle, favart, here, unconventional, new, or, foreign, works, were, premiered, which, were, rejected, at, the, more, conservative, paris, opera, the, beginnings, of, french, romantic, opera, are, situated, in, the, post, revolutionary, environment, the, change, of, regime, entailed, the, replacement, of, classical, mythological, themes, linked, to, the, aristocracy, by, new, themes, and, characters, based, on, popular, heroism, with, a, series, of, works, that, were, called, salvation, opera, including, les, rigueurs, du, clo, tre, 1790, by, henri, montan, berton, and, le, si, ge, de, lille, 1792, by, rodolphe, kreutzer, however, these, propagandist, works, of, the, revolution, failed, to, make, the, public, forget, that, opera, was, first, and, foremost, entertainment, a, fact, helped, by, the, work, of, tienne, nicolas, m, hul, who, in, those, years, premiered, several, operas, euphrosine, 1790, stratonice, 1792, m, lidore, et, phrosine, 1794, and, ariodant, 1799, in, these, works, the, characters, found, themselves, in, random, situations, that, threw, them, into, intense, emotions, a, fact, that, would, be, the, neuralgic, point, of, romantic, opera, paradoxically, among, the, first, exponents, of, french, romantic, opera, were, two, italian, composers, established, in, france, luigi, cherubini, and, gaspare, spontini, the, former, settled, in, paris, in, 1787, when, he, had, already, composed, thirteen, operas, in, italy, in, d, mophon, 1788, he, began, the, course, of, what, would, become, french, romantic, opera, which, he, would, put, on, track, with, lodo, ska, 1791, where, he, introduced, more, real, characters, and, more, dramatic, situations, with, a, richer, and, more, powerful, orchestration, and, effects, based, on, nature, in, this, case, a, fire, his, masterpiece, was, m, d, e, medea, 1797, based, on, a, tragedy, by, pierre, corneille, spontini, moved, to,

work, evocative, and, suggestive, that, is, still, novel, today, with, this, work, he, initiated, the, genre, of, literary, opera, literaturoper, a, type, of, opera, based, on, literary, texts, respected, in, their, integrity, which, while, they, can, be, reduced, cannot, be, altered, in, their, essence, and, which, are, declaimed, in, the, style, of, the, russian, op, ra, dialogu, and,

that, took, place, during, the, century, the, transforming, experimental, and, renovating, interest, of, the, artistic, avant, gardes, was, translated, into, a, new, musical, language, at, the, same, time, that, a, technical, renovation, took, place, motivated, by, the, appearance, of, new, technologies, such, as, electronic, music, all, this, resulted, in, new, compositional, methods, and, new, sound, ranges, which, were, adapted, to, the, new, musical, movements, that, were, happening, in, the, course, of, the, century, the, new, music, composed, in, this, century, broke, radically, with, the, past, and, sought, a, new, language, breaking, the, scheme, of, traditional, musical, discourse, if, necessary, harmony, melody, and, tonality, were, broken, many, of, these, innovations, caused, bewilderment, especially, atonality, in, a, public, accustomed, to, a, hierarchy, of, notes, where, a, fundamental, note, dominated, in, atonality, each, note, has, equal, relevance, to, the, others, for, this, reason, contemporary, music, has, not, enjoyed, great, public, success, and, has, often, been, confined, to, a, closed, circle, of, intellectuals, opera, in, the, twentieth, century, maintained, the, previous, repertoire, which, continued, to, be, successfully, performed, in, the, best, theaters, and, auditoriums, of, the, world, while, at, the, production, level, although, there, was, a, copious, and, excellent, production, the, innovations, produced, in, this, field, did, not, enjoy, great, success, among, the, majority, public, the, composers, eagerness, to, experiment, provoked, harsh, criticism, and, controversy, if, not, even, censorship, or, political, persecution, in, the, soviet, union, stalin, forced, shostakovich, to, adhere, to, the, regime, s, cultural, guidelines, after, attending, a, performance, of, lady, macbeth, of, mtsensk, in, 1936, in, nazi, germany, avant, garde, composers, were, classified, as, degenerate, musicians, and, many, had, to, go, into, exile, during, this, century, there, was, even, experimentation, with, the, traditional, operatic, repertoire, through, avant, garde, productions, more, modern, scenographies, and, contemporary, adaptations, of, classical, operas, as, was, the, trend, in, the, 1920s, at, the, kroll, opera, in, berlin, or, as, carried, out, by, wieland, wagner, grandson, of, the, composer, at, the, bayreuth, festival, on, the, other, hand, in, this, period, the, fascination, with, opera, singers, continued, and, even, increased, sometimes, becoming, highly, popular, phenomena, such, as, the, so, called, tres, tenores, luciano, pavarotti, jos, carreras, and, pl, cido, domingo, it, is, worth, noting, that, the, technical, advances, that, allowed, voice, recording, popularized, this, genre, domestically, enrico, caruso, for, example, was, one, of, the, singers, who, was, most, lavish, in, recording, his, performances, thus, increasing, his, popularity, other, media, that, contributed, to, the, diffusion, of, opera, were, radio, cinema, and, television, in, 1951, the, first, television, opera, amahl, and, the, night, visitors, by, gian, carlo, menotti, was, composed, this, century, saw, numerous, novelties, in, the, field, of, scenography, from, verismo, emerged, a, more, sober, and, realistic, trend, in, stage, representation, whose, pioneers, were, andr, antoine, founder, of, the, th, tre, libre, in, paris, and, otto, brahm, at, the, head, of, the, freie, b, hne, in, berlin, max, reinhardt, director, of, the, deutsches, theater, introduced, numerous, innovations, such, as, three, dimensional, sets, and, the, use, of, lighting, to, create, atmosphere, another, innovator, was, alfred, roller, who, teamed, up, with, gustav, mahler, conductor, at, the, vienna, hofoper, both, of, whom, strove, to, integrate, the, stage, performance, with, the, musical, drama, as, a, unified, whole, at, the, beginning, of, this, century, emerged, the, chamber, opera, a, minor, modality, of, the, genre, composed, of, one, act, works, with, few, characters, and, a, reduced, orchestra, a, format, similar, to, the, g, nero, chico, of, the, spanish, zarzuela, examples, would, be, l, heure, espagnole, by, ravel, 1911, arlecchino, by, busoni, 1917, and, histoire, du, soldat, by, stravinski, 1918, in, vienna, the, kammeroper, dedicated, to, this, genre, was, founded, in, 1953, the, english, composer, benjamin, britten, went, so, far, as, to, found, his, own, chamber, opera, orchestra, the, english, opera, group, on, the, other, hand, the, traditional, operetta, genre, evolved, into, the, musical, a, revamped, genre, that, relied, more, on, popular, music, and, dance, in, centers, such, as, the, west, end, theaters, in, london, or, the, broadway, theaters, in, new, york, other, media, that, contributed, to, the, diffusion, of, opera, were, radio, cinema, and, television, in, 1951, the, first, television, opera, amahl, and, the, night, visitors, by, gian, carlo, menotti, was, composed, another, phenomenon, of, relevance, in, this, century, was, the, proliferation, of, opera, festivals, which, counted, on, the, example, of, the, bayreuth, festival, 1876, in, 1901, the, munich, festival, appeared, followed, by, the, savonlinna, 1912, verona, 1913, salzburg, 1920, florence, maggio, musicale, fiorentino, 1933, glyndebourne, 1934, ravinia, 1936, edinburgh,

the, opera, director, ella, marchment, explained, that, for, every, hour, of, a, performance, an, opera, director, will, complete, 150, hours, of, preparation, and, rehearsals, or, 2, 5, hours, of, work, for, every, minute, of, onstage, time, the, expressionism, emerged, at, the, beginning, of, the, century, as, a, style, fundamentally, concerned, with, the, inner, expressiveness, of, the, individual, in, its, psychological, deepening, as, opposed, to, the, dominant, naturalism, at, the, turn, of, the, century, which, in, opera, gave, the, verismo, in, this, current, interpersonal, relationships, emotionality, and, the, psychic, states, of, the, characters, were, especially, valued, on, a, literary, level, its, referents, were, franz, kafka, james, joyce, and, the, german, playwrights, ernst, toller, frank, wedekind, and, georg, kaiser, for, expressionist, authors, art, was, a, form, of, expression, not, entertainment, so, they, were, more, concerned, with, the, message, they, wanted, to, convey, than, with, style, or, musical, or, plot, device, in, france, this, style, was, practiced, by, some, composers, who, formed, a, group, called, les, six, francis, poulenc, darius, milhaud, arthur, honegger, germaine, tailleferre, georges, auric, and, louis, durey, interested, in, musical, avant, garde, and, popular, rhythms, with, an, informal, and, spontaneous, style, poulenc, author, of, his, own, librettos, stood, out, for, his, lyrical, melodies, his, first, opera, was, les, mamelles, de, tir, sias, the, breasts, of, tiresias, 1947, on, a,
