changes, over, time, dealing, with, a, history, of, austria, raises, a, number, of, questions, e, g, whether, it, is, confined, to, the, current, or, former, republic, of, austria, or, extends, also, to, all, lands, formerly, ruled, by, the, rulers, of, austria, furthermore, should, austrian, history, include, the, period, 1938, 1945, when, it, nominally, did, not, exist, of, the, lands, now, part, of, the, second, republic, of, austria, many, were, added, over, time, only, two, of, the, nine, provinces, lower, and, upper, austria, are, strictly, austria, while, other, parts, of, its, former, sovereign, territory, are, now, part, of, other, countries, e, g, italy, croatia, slovenia, and, czechia, within, austria, there, are, regionally, and, temporally, varying, affinities, to, adjacent, countries, the, alps, were, inaccessible, during, the, ice, age, so, human, habitation, dates, no, earlier, than, the, middle, paleolithic, era, during, the, time, of, the, neanderthals, the, oldest, traces, of, human, habitation, in, austria, more, than, 250, 000, years, ago, were, found, in, the, repolust, cave, at, badl, near, peggau, in, the, graz, umgebung, district, of, styria,

directed, his, operations, against, italy, demanding, noricum, among, another, territory, finally, sacking, rome, in, 410, but, dying, on, the, route, home, that, year, the, visigoths, eventually, moved, on, allowing, a, short, period, of, stability, apart, from, domestic, disturbances, in, 431, in, 451, huns, poured, through, the, area, and, in, 453, pannonia, was, evacuated, the, death, of, attila, in, 453, allowed, the, ostrogoths, to, scatter, his, hunnish, empire, many, tribes, formerly, under, the, huns, now, started, to, settle, along, the, danube, basin, and, assert, their, independence, among, these, were, the, rugii, who, formed, their, own, lands, rugiland, across, the, danube, from, 472, ostrogoths, and, alamanni, invaded, the, area, but, did, not, subdue, it, even, after, odoacer, had, overthrown, the, last, western, roman, emperor, in, 476, remnants, of, the, roman, administration, remained, in, the, provinces, before, the, final, collapse, of, late, antiquity,

briefly, appeared, in, the, northern, and, eastern, regions, around, 500, were, driven, south, into, italy, by, the, avars, by, 567, the, avars, and, their, vassal, slavs, had, established, themselves, from, the, baltic, sea, to, the, balkans, after, the, avars, suffered, setbacks, in, the, east, in, 626, the, slavs, rebelled, establishing, their, own, territories, the, carantanians, alpine, slavs, elected, a, bavarian, odilo, as, their, count, and, successfully, resisted, further, avar, subjugation, the, carantanians, migrated, westward, along, the, drava, into, the, eastern, alps, in, the, wake, of, the, expansion, of, their, avar, overlords, during, the, 7th, century, mixed, with, the, celto, romanic, population, and, established, the, realm, of, carantania, later, carinthia, which, covered, much, of, eastern, and, central, austrian, territory, and, was, the, first, independent, slavic, state, in, europe, centered, at, zollfeld, together, with, the, indigenous, population, they, were, able, to, resist, further, encroachment, of, the, neighboring, franks, and, avars, in, the, southeastern, alps, meanwhile, the, germanic, tribe, of, the, bavarii, frankish, vassals, had, developed, in, the, 5th, and, 6th, century, in, the, west, of, the, country, and, in, later, known, bavaria, while, alemans, had, settled, in, later, known, vorarlberg, in, the, northern, alps, the, bavarians, had, become, established, as, a, stem, dukedom, around, 550, under, agilolfing, rule, until, 788, as, an, eastern, frankish, empire, outpost, those, lands, that, were, occupied, by, the, bavarians, extended, south, to, later, known, south, tyrol, and, east, to, the, enns, the, administrative, center, was, at, regensburg, those, groups, mixed, with, the, rhaeto, romanic, population, and, pushed, it, up, into, the, mountains, along, the, puster, valley, in, the, south, of, modern, austria, slavs, had, settled, in, the, valleys, of, the, drava, mura, and, save, by, 600, the, westward, slavic, migration, stopped, further, bavarian, migration, eastwards, by, 610, their, most, westward, expansion, was, reached, in, 650, at, the, puster, valley, but, gradually, fell, back, to, the, enns, by, 780, the, settlement, boundary, between, slavs, and, bavarians, roughly, corresponds, to, a, line, from, freistadt, through, linz, salzburg, lungau, to, east, tyrol, lesachtal, with, avars, and, slavs, occupying, eastern, austria, and, modern, bohemia, carantania, under, pressure, of, the, avars, became, a, vassal, to, bavaria, in, 745, and, was, later, incorporated, into, the, carolingian, empire, first, as, a, tribal, margravate, under, slavic, dukes, and, after, the, failed, rebellion, of, ljudevit, posavski, in, the, early, 9th, century, under, frankish, appointed, noblemen, during, the, following, centuries, bavarian, settlers, went, down, the, danube, and, up, the, alps, a, process, through, which, austria, was, to, become, a, mostly, german, speaking, country, only, in, southern, carinthia, the, slavs, maintained, their, language, and, identity, until, the, early, 20th, century, when, assimilation, reduced, them, to, a, small, minority, bavarian, relationship, with, the, franks, varied, achieving, temporary, independence, by, 717, only, to, be, subjugated, by, charles, martel, finally, charlemagne, emperor, 800, 814, deposed, the, last, agilolfing, duke, tassilo, iii, assuming, direct, carolingian, control, in, 788, with, non, hereditary, bavarian, kings, charlemagne, subsequently, led, the, franks, and, bavarians, against, the, eastern, avars, in, 791, so, that, by, 803, they, had, fallen, back, to, the, east, of, the, fischa, and, leitha, rivers, these, conquests, enabled, the, establishment, of, a, system, of, defensive, marches, military, borderlands, from, the, danube, to, the, adriatic, by, around, 800, sterreich, the, kingdom, of, the, east, had, been, joined, to, the, holy, roman, empire, among, these, was, an, eastern, march, the, avar, march, corresponding, roughly, to, present, day, lower, austria, bordered, by, the, rivers, enns, raab, and, drava, while, to, the, south, lay, the, march, of, carinthia, both, marches, were, collectively, referred, to, as, the, marcha, orientalis, eastern, march, a, prefecture, of, the, duchy, of, bavaria, in, 805, the, avars, with, charlemagne, s, permission, led, by, the, avar, khagan, settled, south, eastward, from, vienna, a, new, threat, appeared, in, 862, the, hungarians, following, the, pattern, of, displacement, from, more, eastern, territories, by, superior, forces, by, 896, the, hungarians, were, present, in, large, numbers, on, the, hungarian, plain, from, which, they, raided, the, frankish, domains, they, defeated, the, moravians, and, in, 907, defeated, the, bavarians, at, the, battle, of, pressburg, and, by, 909, had, overrun, the, marches, forcing, the, franks, and, bavarians, back, to, the, enns, river, bavaria, became, a, margraviate, under, engeldeo, 890, 895, and, was, re, established, as, a, duchy, under, arnulf, the, bad, 907, 937, who, united, it, with, the, duchy, of, carinthia, occupying, most, of, the, eastern, alps, this, proved, short, lived, his, son, eberhard, 937, 938, found, himself, in, conflict, with, the, german, king, otto, i, otto, the, great, who, deposed, him, the, next, duke, was, henry, i, 947, 955, who, was, otto, s, brother, in, 955, otto, successfully, forced, back, the, hungarians, at, the, battle, of, lechfeld, beginning, a, slow, reconquest, of, the, eastern, lands, including, istria, and, carniola, during, the, reign, of, henry, s, son, henry, ii, the, quarrelsome, 955, 976, otto, became, the, first, holy, roman, emperor, 962, and, bavaria, became, a, duchy, of, the, holy, roman, empire, otto, i, re, established, the, eastern, march, and, was, succeeded, by, otto, ii, in, 967, and, found, himself, in, conflict, with, henry, who, he, deposed, allowing, him, to, re, organise, the, duchies, of, his, empire, otto, considerably, reduced, bavaria, re, establishing, carinthia, to, the, south, to, the, east, he, established, a, new, bavarian, eastern, march, subsequently, known, as, austria, under, leopold, count, of, babenberg, in, 976, leopold, i, also, known, as, leopold, the, illustrious, ruled, austria, from, 976, to, 994, the, marches, were, overseen, by, a, comes, or, dux, as, appointed, by, the, emperor, these, terms, are, usually, translated, as, count, or, duke, but, these, terms, conveyed, very, different, meanings, in, the, early, middle, ages, so, to, avoid, misunderstanding, historians, usually, employ, the, latin, versions, when, discussing, the, titles, and, their, holders, in, lombardic, speaking, countries, the, title, was, eventually, regularized, to, margrave, german, markgraf, i, e, count, of, the, mark, the, first, recorded, instance, of, the, name, austria, appeared, in, 996, in, a, document, of, king, otto, iii, written, as, ostarr, chi, referring, to, the, territory, of, the, babenberg, march, in, addition, for, a, long, time, the, form, osterlant, was, in, use, the, inhabitants, being, referred, to, as, ostermann, or, osterfrau, the, latinized, name, austria, applied, to, this, area, appears, in, the, 12th, century, writings, in, the, time, of, leopold, iii, 1095, 1136, compare, austrasia, as, the, name, for, the, north, eastern, part, of, the, frankish, empire, the, term, ostmark, is, not, historically, certain, and, appears, to, be, a, translation, of, marchia, orientalis, that, came, up, only, much, later, the, babenbergs, pursued, a, policy, of, settling, the, country, clearing, forests, and, founding, towns, and, monasteries, they, ruled, the, march, from, p, chlarn, initially, and, later, from, melk, continually, expanding, the, territory, eastward, along, the, danube, valley, so, that, by, 1002, it, reached, vienna, the, eastward, expansion, was, finally, halted, by, the, newly, christianized, hungarians, in, 1030, when, king, stephen, 1001, 1038, of, hungary, defeated, the, emperor, conrad, ii, 1024, 1039, at, vienna, a, core, territory, had, finally, been, established, the, land, contained, the, remnant, of, many, prior, civilisations, but, the, bavarians, predominated, except, in, the, lake, constance, area, to, the, west, occupied, by, the, alemanni, vorarlberg, pockets, of, the, celto, romanic, population, persisted, such, as, around, salzburg, and, roman, place, names, persisted, such, as, juvavum, salzburg, in, addition, this, population, was, distinguished, by, christianity, and, by, their, language, a, latin, dialect, romansch, salzburg, was, already, a, bishopric, 739, and, by, 798, an, archbishopric, although, the, germanic, bavarians, steadily, replaced, romansch, as, the, main, language, they, adopted, many, roman, customs, and, became, increasingly, christianized, similarly, in, the, east, german, replaced, the, slavic, language, the, march, of, austria, s, neighbours, were, the, duchy, of, bavaria, to, the, west, the, kingdoms, of, bohemia, and, poland, to, the, north, the, kingdom, of, hungary, to, the, east, and, the, duchy, of, carinthia, to, the, south, in, this, setting, austria, still, subject, to, bavaria, was, a, relatively, small, player, the, babenberg, margraves, controlled, very, little, of, modern, austria, salzburg, historically, part, of, bavaria, became, an, ecclesiastical, territory, while, styria, was, part, of, the, carinthian, duchy, the, babenbergs, had, relatively, small, holdings, with, not, only, salzburg, but, the, lands, of, the, diocese, of, passau, lying, in, the, hands, of, the, church, and, the, nobility, controlling, much, of, the, rest, however, they, embarked, on, a, programme, of, consolidating, their, power, base, one, such, method, was, to, employ, indentures, servants, such, as, the, kuenringern, family, as, ministeriales, and, given, considerable, military, and, administrative, duties, they, survived, as, a, dynasty, through, good, fortune, and, skill, at, power, politics, in, that, era, dominated, by, the, continual, struggle, between, emperor, and, papacy, the, path, was, not, always, smooth, the, fifth, margrave, leopold, ii, the, fair, 1075, 1095, was, temporarily, deposed, by, the, emperor, henry, iv, 1084, 1105, after, finding, himself, on, the, wrong, side, of, the, investiture, dispute, however, leopold, s, son, leopold, iii, the, good, 1095, 1136, backed, henry, s, rebellious, son, henry, v, 1111, 1125, contributed, to, his, victory, and, was, rewarded, with, the, hand, of, henry, s, sister, agnes, von, waiblingen, in, 1106, thus, allying, himself, with, the, imperial, family, leopold, then, concentrated, on, pacifying, the, nobility, his, monastic, foundations, particularly, klosterneuburg, and, heiligenkreuz, led, to, his, posthumous, canonisation, in, 1458, and, he, became, austria, s, patron, saint, leopold, iii, was, succeeded, by, his, son, leopold, iv, the, generous, 1137, 1141, leopold, further, enhanced, the, status, of, austria, by, also, becoming, duke, of, bavaria, in, 1139, as, leopold, i, bavaria, itself, had, been, in, the, hands, of, the, welf, guelph, dynasty, who, were, pitted, against, the, hohenstaufen, the, latter, came, to, the, imperial, throne, in, 1138, in, the, person, of, conrad, iii, 1138, 1152, the, duke, of, bavaria, henry, the, proud, was, himself, a, candidate, for, the, imperial, crown, and, disputed, the, election, of, conrad, and, was, subsequently, deprived, of, the, duchy, which, was, given, to, leopold, iv, when, leopold, died, his, lands, were, inherited, by, his, brother, henry, ii, heinrich, jasomirgott, 1141, 1177, in, the, meantime, conrad, had, been, succeeded, as, emperor, by, his, nephew, frederick, i, barbarossa, 1155, 1190, who, was, descended, from, both, the, welfs, and, hohenstauffens, and, sought, to, end, the, conflicts, within, germany, to, this, end, he, returned, bavaria, to, the, welfs, in, 1156, but, as, compensation, elevated, austria, to, a, duchy, through, an, instrument, known, as, the, privilegium, minus, henry, ii, thus, became, duke, of, austria, in, exchange, for, losing, the, title, of, duke, of, bavaria, austria, was, now, an, independent, dominion, within, the, holy, roman, empire, and, henry, moved, his, official, residence, to, vienna, that, year, in, 1186, the, georgenberg, pact, bequeathed, austria, s, southern, neighbour, the, duchy, of, styria, to, austria, upon, the, death, of, the, childless, duke, of, styria, ottokar, iv, which, occurred, in, 1192, styria, had, been, carved, out, of, the, northern, marches, of, carinthia, and, only, raised, to, the, status, of, duchy, in, 1180, however, the, territory, of, the, duchy, of, styria, extended, far, beyond, the, current, state, of, styria, including, parts, of, present, day, slovenia, lower, styria, and, also, parts, of, upper, austria, the, traungau, the, area, around, wels, and, steyr, and, lower, austria, the, county, of, pitten, today, s, districts, of, wiener, neustadt, and, neunkirchen, the, second, duke, of, austria, henry, ii, s, son, leopold, v, the, virtuous, 1177, 1194, became, duke, of, these, combined, territories, leopold, is, perhaps, best, known, for, his, imprisonment, of, the, british, king, richard, i, following, the, third, crusade, 1189, 1192, in, 1192, at, d, rnstein, the, ransom, money, he, received, helped, finance, many, of, his, projects, at, that, time, the, babenberg, dukes, came, to, be, one, of, the, most, influential, ruling, families, in, the, region, peaking, in, the, reign, of, henry, s, grandson, leopold, vi, the, glorious, 1198, 1230, the, fourth, duke, under, whom, the, culture, of, the, high, middle, ages, flourished, including, the, introduction, of, gothic, art, on, leopold, s, death, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, frederick, ii, the, quarrelsome, 1230, 1246, in, 1238, he, divided, the, land, into, two, areas, divided, by, the, river, enns, that, part, above, the, enns, became, ob, erhalb, der, enns, above, the, enns, or, upper, austria, although, other, names, such, as, supra, anasum, from, an, old, latin, name, for, the, river, and, austria, superior, were, also, in, use, those, lands, below, the, enns, or, unter, der, enns, became, known, as, lower, austria, the, traungau, and, steyr, were, made, part, of, upper, austria, rather, than, styria, another, of, frederick, s, achievements, was, a, patent, of, protection, for, jews, in, 1244, however, frederick, was, killed, in, the, battle, of, the, leitha, river, against, the, hungarians, and, had, no, surviving, children, thus, the, babenburg, dynasty, became, extinct, in, 1246, what, followed, was, an, interregnum, a, period, of, several, decades, during, which, the, status, of, the, country, was, disputed, and, during, which, frederick, ii, s, duchy, fell, victim, to, a, prolonged, power, play, between, rival, forces, during, this, time, there, were, multiple, claimants, to, the, title, including, vladislaus, margrave, of, moravia, son, of, king, wenceslaus, i, of, bohemia, king, wenceslaus, aimed, at, acquiring, the, duchy, of, austria, by, arranging, the, marriage, of, vladislaus, to, the, last, duke, s, niece, gertrud, herself, a, potential, heir, and, claimant, according, to, the, privilegium, minus, issued, by, emperor, frederick, barbarossa, in, 1156, the, austrian, lands, could, be, bequeathed, through, the, female, line, vladislaus, received, the, homage, of, the, austrian, nobility, but, died, shortly, afterwards, on, 3, january, 1247, before, he, could, take, possession, of, the, duchy, next, came, herman, of, baden, in, 1248, he, also, made, claim, by, seeking, gertrud, s, hand, but, did, not, have, the, support, of, the, nobility, herman, died, in, 1250, and, his, claim, was, taken, up, by, his, son, frederick, but, his, claim, was, thwarted, by, the, bohemian, invasion, of, austria, in, an, attempt, to, end, the, turmoil, a, group, of, austrian, nobles, invited, the, king, of, bohemia, ottokar, ii, p, emysl, vladislaus, brother, to, become, austria, s, ruler, in, 1251, his, father, had, attempted, to, invade, austria, in, 1250, ottokar, then, proceeded, to, ally, himself, to, the, babenbergs, by, marrying, margaret, duke, frederick, ii, s, sister, and, daughter, to, leopold, vi, therefore, making, him, a, potential, claimant, to, the, throne, in, 1252, he, subdued, the, quarrelsome, nobles, and, made, himself, ruler, of, most, of, the, area, including, austria, styria, which, was, previously, under, the, rule, of, hungary, as, well, as, carniola, and, carinthia, both, of, which, he, had, claimed, by, a, dubious, right, of, inheritance, ottokar, was, a, lawmaker, and, builder, among, his, achievements, was, the, founding, of, the, hofburg, palace, in, vienna, ottokar, was, in, a, position, to, establish, a, new, empire, given, the, weakness, of, the, holy, roman, empire, on, the, death, of, frederick, ii, 1220, 1250, particularly, after, the, hohenstauffen, dynasty, was, ended, in, 1254, with, the, death, of, conrad, iv, and, the, ensuing, imperial, interregnum, 1254, 1273, thus, ottokar, put, himself, forward, as, a, candidate, for, the, imperial, throne, but, was, unsuccessful, during, the, interregnum, austria, was, the, scene, of, intense, persecution, of, heretics, by, the, inquisition, the, first, instances, appear, in, 1260, in, over, forty, parishes, in, the, southern, danube, region, between, the, salzkammergut, and, the, vienna, woods, and, were, mainly, directed, against, the, waldensians, ottokar, again, contested, the, imperial, throne, in, 1273, being, almost, alone, in, this, position, in, the, electoral, college, this, time, he, refused, to, accept, the, authority, of, the, successful, candidate, rudolf, of, habsburg, emperor, 1273, 1291, in, november, 1274, the, imperial, diet, at, nuremberg, ruled, that, all, crown, estates, seized, since, the, death, of, the, emperor, frederick, ii, 1250, must, be, restored, and, that, king, ottokar, ii, must, answer, to, the, diet, for, not, recognising, the, new, emperor, rudolf, ottokar, refused, either, to, appear, or, to, restore, the, duchies, of, austria, styria, and, carinthia, with, the, march, of, carniola, which, he, had, claimed, through, his, first, wife, a, babenberg, heiress, and, which, he, had, seized, while, disputing, them, with, another, babenberg, heir, margrave, hermann, vi, of, baden, rudolph, refuted, ottokar, s, succession, to, the, babenberg, patrimony, declaring, that, the, provinces, must, revert, to, the, imperial, crown, due, to, the, lack, of, male, line, heirs, a, position, that, however, conflicted, with, the, provisions, of, the, austrian, privilegium, minus, king, ottokar, was, placed, under, the, imperial, ban, and, in, june, 1276, war, was, declared, against, him, rudolf, laying, siege, to, vienna, having, persuaded, ottokar, s, former, ally, duke, henry, xiii, of, lower, bavaria, to, switch, sides, rudolph, compelled, the, bohemian, king, to, cede, the, four, provinces, to, the, control, of, the, imperial, administration, in, november, 1276, ottokar, having, relinquished, his, territories, outside, of, the, czech, lands, rudolph, re, invested, him, with, the, kingdom, of, bohemia, betrothed, his, youngest, daughter, judith, of, habsburg, to, ottokar, s, son, wenceslaus, ii, and, made, a, triumphal, entry, into, vienna, ottokar, however, raised, questions, about, the, execution, of, the, treaty, made, an, alliance, with, some, piast, chiefs, of, poland, and, procured, the, support, of, several, german, princes, again, including, henry, xiii, of, lower, bavaria, to, meet, this, coalition, rudolph, formed, an, alliance, with, king, ladislaus, iv, of, hungary, and, gave, additional, privileges, to, the, vienna, citizens, on, 26, august, 1278, the, rival, armies, met, at, the, battle, on, the, marchfeld, northeast, of, vienna, where, ottokar, was, defeated, and, killed, the, margraviate, of, moravia, was, subdued, and, its, government, entrusted, to, rudolph, s, representatives, leaving, ottokar, s, widow, kunigunda, of, slavonia, in, control, of, only, the, province, surrounding, prague, while, the, young, wenceslaus, ii, was, again, betrothed, to, judith, rudolf, was, thus, able, to, assume, sole, control, over, austria, as, duke, of, austria, and, styria, 1278, 1282, which, remained, under, habsburg, rule, for, over, six, centuries, until, 1918, thus, austria, and, the, empire, came, under, a, single, habsburg, crown, and, after, a, few, centuries, 1438, would, remain, so, almost, continuously, see, below, till, 1806, when, the, empire, was, dissolved, obviating, the, frequent, conflicts, that, had, occurred, previously, rudolf, i, spent, several, years, establishing, his, authority, in, austria, finding, some, difficulty, in, establishing, his, family, as, successors, to, the, rule, of, the, province, at, length, the, hostility, of, the, princes, was, overcome, and, he, was, able, to, bequeath, austria, to, his, two, sons, in, december, 1282, at, the, diet, of, augsburg, rudolph, invested, the, duchies, of, austria, and, styria, on, his, sons, albert, i, 1282, 1308, and, rudolph, ii, the, debonair, 1282, 1283, as, co, rulers, jointly, and, severally, and, so, laid, the, foundation, of, the, house, of, habsburg, rudolf, continued, his, campaigns, subduing, and, subjugating, and, adding, to, his, domains, dying, in, 1291, but, leaving, dynastic, instability, in, austria, where, frequently, the, duchy, of, austria, was, shared, between, family, members, however, rudolf, was, unsuccessful, in, ensuring, the, succession, to, the, imperial, throne, for, the, dukes, of, austria, and, styria, the, conjoint, dukedom, lasted, only, a, year, until, the, treaty, of, rheinfelden, in, 1283, established, the, habsburg, order, of, succession, establishing, primogeniture, then, eleven, year, old, duke, rudolph, ii, had, to, waive, all, his, rights, to, the, thrones, of, austria, and, styria, to, the, benefit, of, his, elder, brother, albert, i, while, rudolph, was, supposed, to, be, compensated, this, did, not, happen, dying, in, 1290, and, his, son, john, subsequently, murdered, his, uncle, albert, i, in, 1308, for, a, brief, period, albert, i, also, shared, the, duchies, with, rudolph, iii, the, good, 1298, 1307, and, finally, achieved, the, imperial, throne, in, 1298, on, albert, i, s, death, the, duchy, but, not, the, empire, passed, to, his, son, frederick, the, fair, 1308, 1330, at, least, not, until, 1314, when, he, became, co, ruler, of, the, empire, with, louis, iv, frederick, also, had, to, share, the, duchy, with, his, brother, leopold, i, the, glorious, 1308, 1326, yet, another, brother, albert, ii, the, lame, 1330, 1358, succeeded, frederick, the, pattern, of, corule, persisted, since, albert, had, to, share, the, role, with, another, younger, brother, otto, i, the, merry, 1330, 1339, although, he, did, attempt, to, unsuccessfully, lay, down, the, rules, of, succession, in, the, albertinian, house, rule, when, otto, died, in, 1339, his, two, sons, frederick, ii, and, leopold, ii, replaced, him, making, three, simultaneous, dukes, of, austria, from, 1339, to, 1344, when, both, of, them, died, in, their, teens, without, issue, single, rule, in, the, duchy, of, austria, finally, returned, when, his, son, rudolph, iv, succeeded, him, in, 1358, in, the, 14th, century, the, habsburgs, began, to, accumulate, other, provinces, in, the, vicinity, of, the, duchy, of, austria, which, had, remained, a, small, territory, along, the, danube, and, styria, which, they, had, acquired, with, austria, from, ottokar, in, 1335, albert, ii, inherited, the, duchy, of, carinthia, and, the, march, of, carniola, from, the, then, rulers, the, house, of, gorizia, rudolf, iv, the, founder, 1358, 1365, was, the, first, to, claim, the, title, of, archduke, of, austria, through, the, privilegium, maius, of, 1359, which, was, actually, a, forgery, and, not, recognized, outside, of, austria, till, 1453, however, it, would, have, placed, him, on, a, level, footing, with, the, other, prince, electors, of, the, holy, roman, empire, rudolph, was, one, of, the, most, active, rulers, of, his, time, initiating, many, measures, and, elevating, the, importance, of, the, city, of, vienna, at, that, time, vienna, was, ecclesiastically, subordinate, to, the, diocese, of, passau, which, rudolph, subverted, by, founding, st, stephen, s, cathedral, and, appointing, the, provost, as, the, archchancellor, of, austria, he, also, founded, the, university, of, vienna, he, improved, the, economy, and, established, a, stable, currency, the, vienna, penny, when, he, died, in, 1365, he, was, without, issue, and, the, succession, passed, to, his, brothers, jointly, under, the, rudolfinian, house, rules, in, 1363, the, county, of, tyrol, was, acquired, by, rudolph, iv, from, margaret, of, tyrol, thus, austria, was, now, a, complex, country, in, the, eastern, alps, and, these, lands, are, often, referred, to, as, the, habsburg, hereditary, lands, as, well, as, simply, austria, since, the, habsburgs, also, began, to, accumulate, lands, far, from, their, hereditary, lands, almost, the, entire, 15th, century, was, a, confusion, of, estate, and, family, disputes, which, considerably, weakened, the, political, and, economic, importance, of, the, habsburg, lands, it, was, not, until, 1453, in, the, reign, of, frederick, v, the, peaceful, 1457, 1493, that, the, country, at, least, the, core, territories, would, be, finally, united, again, rudolph, iv, s, brothers, albert, iii, the, pigtail, and, leopold, iii, the, just, quarreled, ceaselessly, and, eventually, agreed, to, split, the, realm, in, the, treaty, of, neuberg, in, 1379, which, was, to, result, in, further, schisms, later, altogether, this, resulted, in, three, separate, jurisdictions, in, 1379, albert, iii, retained, austria, proper, ruling, till, 1395, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, albert, iv, 1395, 1404, and, grandson, albert, v, 1404, 1439, who, regained, the, imperial, throne, for, the, habsburgs, and, through, his, territorial, acquisitions, was, set, to, become, one, of, the, most, powerful, rulers, in, europe, had, he, not, died, when, he, did, leaving, only, a, posthumous, heir, born, four, months, later, ladislaus, the, posthumous, 1440, 1457, instead, it, was, ladislaus, guardian, and, successor, the, leopoldian, frederick, v, the, peaceful, 1457, 1493, who, benefited, the, albertinian, line, having, become, extinct, the, title, now, passed, back, to, the, leopoldians, frederick, was, so, aware, of, the, potential, of, being, the, young, ladislaus, guardian, that, he, refused, to, let, him, rule, independently, upon, reaching, majority, 12, in, austria, at, the, time, and, had, to, be, forced, to, release, him, by, the, austrian, estates, league, of, mailberg, 1452, leopold, iii, took, the, remaining, territories, ruling, till, 1386, he, was, succeeded, by, two, of, his, sons, jointly, william, the, courteous, 1386, 1406, and, leopold, iv, the, fat, 1386, 1411, in, 1402, yet, another, split, in, the, duchy, occurred, since, leopold, iii, had, had, four, sons, and, neither, leopold, iv, or, william, had, heirs, the, remaining, brothers, then, divided, the, territory, ernest, the, iron, 1402, 1424, took, inner, austria, while, frederick, iv, of, the, empty, pockets, 1402, 1439, took, further, austria, once, william, died, in, 1406, this, took, formal, effect, with, two, separate, ducal, lines, the, elder, ernestine, line, and, junior, tyrolean, line, respectively, ernestine, line, inner, austria, 1406, 1457, the, ernestine, line, consisted, of, ernest, and, a, joint, rule, by, two, of, his, sons, upon, his, death, in, 1424, albert, vi, the, prodigal, 1457, 1463, and, frederick, v, the, peaceful, 1457, 1493, they, too, quarreled, and, in, turn, divided, what, had, now, become, both, lower, and, inner, austria, upon, the, death, of, ladislaus, in, 1457, and, extinction, of, the, albertinians, albert, seized, upper, austria, in, 1458, ruling, from, linz, but, in, 1462, proceeded, to, besiege, his, elder, brother, in, the, hofburg, palace, in, vienna, seizing, lower, austria, too, however, since, he, died, childless, the, following, year, 1463, his, possessions, automatically, reverted, to, his, brother, and, frederick, now, controlled, all, of, the, albertinian, and, ernestine, possessions, frederick, s, political, career, had, advanced, in, a, major, way, since, he, inherited, the, duchy, of, inner, austria, in, 1424, from, being, a, duke, he, became, german, king, as, frederick, iv, in, 1440, and, holy, roman, emperor, as, frederick, iii, 1452, 1493, tyrolean, line, further, austria, 1406, 1490, the, tyrolean, line, consisted, of, frederick, iv, and, his, son, sigismund, the, rich, 1439, 1490, frederick, moved, his, court, to, innsbruck, but, lost, some, of, his, possessions, to, switzerland, sigismund, who, succeeded, him, sold, some, of, his, lands, to, charles, the, bold, in, 1469, and, was, elevated, to, archduke, by, emperor, frederick, iii, in, 1477, he, died, childless, but, in, 1490, he, abdicated, in, the, face, of, unpopularity, and, further, austria, reverted, to, the, then, archduke, maximilian, i, the, last, knight, 1490, 1493, frederick, v, s, son, who, now, effectively, controlled, all, the, habsburg, territory, for, the, first, time, since, 1365, the, inquisition, was, also, active, under, the, habsburgs, particularly, between, 1311, and, 1315, when, inquisitions, were, held, in, steyr, krems, st, p, lten, and, vienna, the, inquisitor, petrus, zwicker, conducted, severe, persecutions, in, steyr, enns, hartberg, sopron, and, vienna, between, 1391, and, 1402, in, 1397, there, were, some, 80, 100, waldensians, burnt, in, steyr, alone, now, remembered, in, a, 1997, monument, during, the, habsburg, duchy, there, were, 13, consecutive, dukes, of, whom, four, were, also, crowned, king, of, germany, rudolf, i, albert, i, frederick, the, fair, and, albert, v, albert, ii, as, king, of, germany, although, none, were, recognised, as, holy, roman, emperors, by, the, pope, when, duke, albert, v, 1404, 1439, was, elected, as, emperor, in, 1438, as, albert, ii, as, the, successor, to, his, father, in, law, sigismund, von, luxemburg, 1433, 1437, the, imperial, crown, returned, once, more, to, the, habsburgs, although, albert, himself, only, reigned, for, a, year, 1438, 1439, from, then, on, every, emperor, was, a, habsburg, with, only, one, exception, charles, vii, 1742, 1745, and, austria, s, rulers, were, also, the, holy, roman, emperors, until, its, dissolution, in, 1806, frederick, v, duke, 1424, archduke, 1453, died, 1493, the, peaceful, emperor, frederick, iii, 1452, 1493, confirmed, the, privilegium, maius, of, rudolph, iv, in, 1453, and, so, austria, became, an, official, archduchy, of, the, holy, roman, empire, the, next, step, in, its, ascendancy, within, europe, and, ladislaus, the, posthumous, 1440, 1457, the, first, official, archduke, for, a, brief, period, dying, shortly, after, the, document, was, a, forgery, purportedly, written, by, the, emperor, frederick, i, and, rediscovered, frederick, had, a, clear, motive, for, this, he, was, a, habsburg, he, was, duke, of, inner, austria, in, addition, to, being, emperor, and, up, till, the, previous, year, had, been, guardian, of, the, young, duke, of, lower, austria, ladislaus, he, also, stood, to, inherit, ladislaus, s, title, and, did, so, when, ladislaus, died, four, years, later, becoming, the, second, archduke, the, austrian, archdukes, were, now, of, equal, status, to, the, other, prince, electors, that, selected, the, emperors, austrian, governance, was, now, to, be, based, on, primogeniture, and, indivisibility, later, austria, was, to, become, officially, known, as, erzherzogtum, sterreich, ob, und, unter, der, enns, the, archduchy, of, austria, above, and, below, the, enns, in, 1861, it, was, again, divided, into, upper, and, lower, austria, the, relative, power, of, the, emperor, in, the, monarchy, was, not, great, as, many, other, aristocratic, dynasties, pursued, their, own, political, power, inside, and, outside, the, monarchy, however, frederick, although, lackluster, pursued, a, tough, and, effective, rule, he, pursued, power, through, dynastic, alliances, in, 1477, maximilian, archduke, and, emperor, 1493, 1519, frederick, s, only, son, married, mary, duchess, of, burgundy, thus, acquiring, most, of, the, low, countries, for, the, family, the, strategic, importance, of, this, alliance, was, that, burgundy, which, lay, on, the, western, border, of, the, empire, was, demonstrating, expansionist, tendencies, and, was, at, that, time, one, of, the, richest, and, most, powerful, of, the, western, european, nation, states, with, territories, stretching, from, the, south, of, france, to, the, north, sea, the, alliance, was, achieved, at, no, small, cost, since, france, which, also, claimed, burgundy, contested, this, acquisition, and, maximilian, had, to, defend, his, new, wife, s, territories, from, louis, xi, finally, doing, so, upon, mary, s, death, in, 1482, at, the, peace, of, arras, relationships, with, france, remained, difficult, louis, xi, being, defeated, at, the, battle, of, guinegate, in, 1479, matters, with, france, were, only, concluded, in, 1493, at, the, treaty, of, senlis, after, maximilian, had, become, emperor, this, and, maximilian, s, later, dynastic, alliances, gave, rise, to, the, saying, bella, gerant, alii, tu, felix, austria, nube, nam, quae, mars, aliis, dat, tibi, regna, venus, which, became, a, motto, of, the, dynasty, frederick, s, reign, was, pivotal, in, austrian, history, he, united, the, core, lands, by, simply, outliving, the, rest, of, his, family, from, 1439, when, albert, v, died, and, the, responsibilities, for, both, of, the, core, territories, lay, with, frederick, he, systematically, consolidated, his, power, base, the, next, year, 1440, he, marched, on, rome, as, king, of, the, romans, with, his, ward, ladislaus, the, last, albertinian, duke, and, when, he, was, crowned, in, rome, in, 1452, he, was, not, only, the, first, habsburg, but, also, the, last, german, king, to, be, crowned, in, rome, by, the, pope, the, dynasty, was, now, en, route, to, become, a, world, power, the, concept, of, pietas, austriacae, the, divine, duty, to, rule, had, originated, with, rudolph, i, but, was, reformulated, by, frederick, as, aeiou, alles, erdreich, ist, sterreich, untertan, or, austriae, est, imperare, orbi, universo, austria, s, destiny, is, to, rule, the, world, which, came, to, symbolise, austrian, power, however, not, all, events, proceeded, smoothly, for, frederick, the, austrian, hungarian, war, 1477, 1488, resulted, in, the, hungarian, king, matthias, corvinus, setting, himself, up, in, vienna, in, 1485, till, his, death, in, 1490, hungary, occupied, the, entire, eastern, austria, frederick, therefore, found, himself, with, an, itinerant, court, predominantly, in, the, upper, austrian, capital, of, linz, maximilian, i, shared, rule, with, his, father, during, the, latter, year, of, frederick, s, reign, being, elected, king, of, the, romans, in, 1486, by, acquiring, the, lands, of, the, tyrolean, line, of, the, habsburgs, in, 1490, he, finally, reunited, all, the, austrian, lands, divided, since, 1379, he, also, needed, to, deal, with, the, hungarian, problem, when, mathias, i, died, in, 1490, maximilian, reconquered, the, lost, parts, of, austria, and, established, peace, with, mathias, s, successor, vladislaus, ii, at, the, peace, of, pressburg, in, 1491, however, the, dynastic, pattern, of, division, and, unification, would, be, one, that, kept, repeating, itself, over, time, with, unsettled, borders, maximilian, found, innsbruck, in, the, tyrol, a, safer, place, for, a, capital, between, his, burgundian, and, austrian, lands, although, he, was, rarely, in, any, place, for, very, long, being, acutely, aware, of, how, his, father, had, been, repeatedly, besieged, in, vienna, maximilian, raised, the, art, of, dynastic, alliance, to, a, new, height, and, set, about, systematically, creating, a, dynastic, tradition, albeit, through, considerable, revisionism, his, wife, mary, was, to, die, in, 1482, only, five, years, after, they, were, married, he, then, married, anne, duchess, of, brittany, by, proxy, in, 1490, a, move, that, would, have, brought, brittany, at, that, time, independent, into, the, habsburg, fold, which, was, considered, provocative, to, the, french, monarchy, charles, viii, of, france, had, other, ideas, and, annexed, brittany, and, married, anne, a, situation, complicated, further, by, the, fact, that, he, was, already, betrothed, to, maximilian, s, daughter, margaret, duchess, of, savoy, maximilian, s, son, philip, the, fair, 1478, 1506, married, joanna, heiress, of, castile, and, aragon, in, 1496, and, thus, acquired, spain, and, its, italian, naples, kingdom, of, sicily, and, sardinia, african, and, new, world, appendages, for, the, habsburgs, however, tu, felix, austria, nube, was, perhaps, more, romantic, than, strictly, realistic, since, maximilian, was, not, slow, to, wage, war, when, it, suited, his, purpose, having, settled, matters, with, france, in, 1493, he, was, soon, involved, in, the, long, italian, wars, against, france, 1494, 1559, in, addition, to, the, wars, against, the, french, there, were, the, wars, for, swiss, independence, the, swabian, war, of, 1499, marked, the, last, phase, of, this, struggle, against, the, habsburgs, following, defeat, at, the, battle, of, dornach, in, 1499, austria, was, forced, to, recognise, swiss, independence, at, the, treaty, of, basel, in, 1499, a, process, that, was, finally, formalised, by, the, peace, of, westphalia, in, 1648, this, was, significant, as, the, habsburgs, had, originated, in, switzerland, their, ancestral, home, being, habsburg, castle, in, domestic, policy, maximilian, launched, a, series, of, reforms, at, the, 1495, diet, of, worms, at, which, the, imperial, chamber, court, was, launched, as, the, highest, court, another, new, institution, of, 1495, was, the, reichsregiment, or, imperial, government, meeting, at, nuremberg, this, preliminary, exercise, in, democracy, failed, and, was, dissolved, in, 1502, attempts, at, creating, a, unified, state, were, not, very, successful, but, rather, re, emerged, the, idea, of, the, three, divisions, of, austria, that, existed, prior, to, the, unification, of, frederick, and, maximilian, short, of, funds, for, his, various, schemes, he, relied, heavily, on, banking, families, such, as, the, fugger, s, and, it, was, these, bankers, that, bribed, the, prince, electors, to, choose, maximilian, s, grandson, charles, as, his, successor, one, tradition, he, did, away, with, was, the, centuries, old, custom, that, the, holy, roman, emperor, had, to, be, crowned, by, the, pope, in, rome, unable, to, reach, rome, due, to, venetian, hostility, in, 1508, maximilian, with, the, assent, of, pope, julius, ii, took, the, title, erw, hlter, r, mischer, kaiser, elected, roman, emperor, thus, his, father, frederick, was, the, last, emperor, to, be, crowned, by, the, pope, in, rome, since, philip, the, fair, 1478, 1506, died, before, his, father, maximilian, the, succession, passed, to, philip, s, son, charles, i, 1519, 1521, who, became, the, emperor, charles, v, on, maximilian, s, death, in, 1519, he, reigned, as, emperor, from, 1519, to, 1556, when, in, poor, health, he, abdicated, dying, in, 1558, although, crowned, by, pope, clement, vii, in, bologna, in, 1530, charles, had, sacked, rome, in, 1527, he, was, the, last, emperor, ever, to, be, crowned, by, a, pope, although, he, eventually, fell, short, of, his, vision, of, universal, monarchy, charles, i, is, still, considered, the, most, powerful, of, all, the, habsburgs, his, chancellor, mercurino, gattinara, remarked, in, 1519, that, he, was, on, the, path, to, universal, monarchy, unite, all, christendom, under, one, sceptre, bringing, him, closer, to, frederick, v, s, vision, of, aeiou, and, charles, motto, plus, ultra, still, further, suggested, this, was, his, ambition, having, inherited, his, father, s, possessions, in, 1506, he, was, already, a, powerful, ruler, with, extensive, domains, on, maximilian, s, death, these, domains, became, vast, he, was, now, ruler, of, three, of, europe, s, leading, dynasties, the, house, of, habsburg, of, the, habsburg, monarchy, the, house, of, valois, burgundy, of, the, burgundian, netherlands, and, the, house, of, trast, mara, of, the, crowns, of, castile, and, aragon, this, made, him, ruler, over, extensive, lands, in, central, western, and, southern, europe, and, the, spanish, colonies, in, the, americas, and, asia, as, the, first, king, to, rule, castile, le, n, and, aragon, simultaneously, in, his, own, right, he, became, the, first, king, of, spain, his, empire, spanned, nearly, four, million, square, kilometers, across, europe, the, far, east, and, the, americas, a, number, of, challenges, stood, in, charles, s, way, and, were, to, shape, austria, s, history, for, a, long, time, to, come, these, were, france, the, appearance, of, the, ottoman, empire, to, its, east, and, martin, luther, see, below, following, the, dynastic, tradition, the, habsburgs, hereditary, territories, were, separated, from, this, enormous, empire, at, the, diet, of, worms, in, 1521, when, charles, i, left, them, to, the, regency, of, his, younger, brother, ferdinand, i, 1521, 1564, although, he, then, continued, to, add, to, the, habsburg, territories, since, charles, left, his, spanish, empire, to, his, son, philip, ii, of, spain, the, spanish, territories, became, permanently, alienated, from, the, northern, habsburg, domains, although, remained, allies, for, several, centuries, by, the, time, ferdinand, also, inherited, the, title, of, holy, roman, emperor, from, his, brother, in, 1558, the, habsburgs, had, effectively, turned, an, elective, title, into, a, de, facto, hereditary, one, ferdinand, continued, the, tradition, of, dynastic, marriages, by, marrying, anne, of, bohemia, and, hungary, in, 1521, effectively, adding, those, two, kingdoms, to, the, habsburg, domains, together, with, the, adjacent, territories, of, moravia, silesia, and, lusatia, this, took, effect, when, anne, s, brother, louis, ii, king, of, hungary, and, bohemia, and, hence, the, jagiellon, dynasty, died, without, heir, at, the, battle, of, moh, cs, in, 1526, against, suleiman, the, magnificent, and, the, ottomans, however, by, 1538, the, kingdom, of, hungary, was, divided, into, three, parts, ferdinand, s, election, to, emperor, in, 1558, once, again, reunited, the, austrian, lands, he, had, had, to, cope, with, revolts, in, his, own, lands, religious, turmoil, ottoman, incursions, and, even, contest, for, the, hungarian, throne, from, john, sigismund, z, polya, his, lands, were, by, no, means, the, most, wealthy, of, the, habsburg, lands, but, he, succeeded, in, restoring, internal, order, and, keeping, the, turks, at, bay, while, enlarging, his, frontiers, and, creating, a, central, administration, when, ferdinand, died, in, 1564, the, lands, were, once, more, divided, up, between, his, three, sons, a, provision, he, had, made, in, 1554, when, martin, luther, posted, his, ninety, five, theses, to, the, door, of, the, castle, church, in, wittenberg, in, 1517, he, challenged, the, very, basis, of, the, holy, roman, empire, catholic, christianity, and, hence, habsburg, hegemony, after, the, emperor, charles, v, interrogated, and, condemned, luther, at, the, 1521, diet, of, worms, lutheranism, and, the, protestant, reformation, spread, rapidly, in, the, habsburg, territories, temporarily, freed, from, war, with, france, by, the, 1529, treaty, of, cambrai, and, the, denouncement, of, the, ban, on, luther, by, the, protestant, princes, at, speyer, that, year, the, emperor, revisited, the, issue, next, at, the, diet, of, augsburg, in, 1530, by, which, time, it, was, well, established, with, the, ottoman, threat, growing, see, below, he, needed, to, ensure, that, he, was, not, facing, a, major, schism, within, christianity, he, refuted, the, lutheran, position, augsburg, confession, with, the, confutatio, augustana, and, had, ferdinand, elected, king, of, the, romans, on, 5, january, 1531, ensuring, his, succession, as, a, catholic, monarch, in, response, the, protestant, princes, and, estates, formed, the, schmalkaldic, league, in, february, 1531, with, french, backing, further, turkish, advances, in, 1532, which, required, him, to, seek, protestant, aid, and, other, wars, kept, the, emperor, from, taking, further, action, on, this, front, until, 1547, when, imperial, troops, defeated, the, league, at, the, battle, of, m, hlberg, allowing, him, to, once, more, impose, catholicism, in, 1541, ferdinand, s, appeal, to, the, estates, general, for, aid, against, the, turks, was, met, by, demand, for, religious, tolerance, the, triumph, of, 1547, turned, out, to, be, short, lived, with, french, and, protestant, forces, again, challenging, the, emperor, in, 1552, culminating, in, the, peace, of, augsburg, in, 1555, exhausted, charles, started, to, withdraw, from, politics, and, hand, over, the, reins, protestantism, had, proved, too, firmly, entrenched, to, enable, it, to, be, uprooted, austria, and, the, other, habsburg, hereditary, provinces, and, hungary, and, bohemia, as, well, were, much, affected, by, the, reformation, but, with, the, exception, of, tyrol, the, austrian, lands, shut, out, protestantism, although, the, habsburg, rulers, themselves, remained, catholic, the, non, austrian, provinces, largely, converted, to, lutheranism, which, ferdinand, i, largely, tolerated, the, catholic, response, to, the, protestant, reformation, was, a, conservative, one, but, one, that, did, address, the, issues, raised, by, luther, in, 1545, the, long, running, council, of, trent, began, its, work, of, reform, and, a, counter, reformation, on, the, borders, of, the, habsburg, domains, the, council, continued, intermittently, until, 1563, ferdinand, and, the, austrian, habsburgs, were, far, more, tolerant, than, their, spanish, brethren, and, the, process, initiated, at, trent, however, his, attempts, at, reconciliation, at, the, council, in, 1562, was, rejected, and, although, a, catholic, counteroffensive, existed, in, the, habsburg, lands, from, the, 1550s, it, was, based, on, persuasion, a, process, in, which, the, jesuits, and, peter, canisius, took, the, lead, ferdinand, deeply, regretted, the, failure, to, reconcile, religious, differences, before, his, death, 1564, when, ferdinand, i, married, into, the, hungarian, dynasty, in, 1521, austria, first, encountered, the, westward, ottoman, expansion, which, had, first, come, into, conflict, with, hungary, in, the, 1370s, matters, came, to, a, close, when, his, wife, anne, s, brother, the, young, king, louis, was, killed, fighting, the, turks, under, suleiman, the, magnificent, at, the, battle, of, moh, cs, in, 1526, the, title, passing, to, ferdinand, louis, widow, mary, fled, to, seek, protection, from, ferdinand, the, turks, initially, withdrew, following, this, victory, reappearing, in, 1528, advancing, on, vienna, and, laying, siege, to, it, the, following, year, they, withdrew, that, winter, till, 1532, when, their, advance, was, stopped, by, charles, v, although, they, controlled, much, of, hungary, ferdinand, was, then, forced, to, recognize, john, z, polya, ferdinand, and, the, turks, continued, to, wage, war, between, 1537, and, a, temporary, truce, in, 1547, when, hungary, was, partitioned, however, hostilities, continued, almost, immediately, till, the, treaty, of, constantinople, of, 1562, which, confirmed, the, 1547, borders, the, ottoman, threat, was, to, continue, for, 200, years, ferdinand, i, had, three, sons, who, survived, to, adulthood, and, he, followed, the, potentially, disastrous, habsburg, tradition, of, dividing, up, his, lands, between, them, on, his, death, in, 1564, this, considerably, weakened, austria, particularly, in, the, face, of, the, ottoman, expansion, it, was, not, until, the, reign, of, ferdinand, iii, archduke, 1590, 1637, that, they, were, reunited, again, in, 1620, albeit, briefly, until, 1623, it, was, not, to, be, until, 1665, under, leopold, i, that, the, austrian, lands, were, definitively, united, during, the, next, 60, years, the, habsburg, monarchy, was, divided, into, three, jurisdictions, as, the, eldest, son, maximilian, ii, and, his, sons, were, granted, the, core, territories, of, lower, and, upper, austria, ferdinand, ii, dying, without, living, issue, his, territories, reverted, to, the, core, territories, on, his, death, in, 1595, then, under, rudolf, v, 1576, 1608, maximilian, ii, s, son, maximilian, ii, was, succeeded, by, three, of, his, sons, none, of, whom, left, living, heirs, so, the, line, became, extinct, in, 1619, upon, the, abdication, of, albert, vii, 1619, 1619, thus, charles, ii, s, son, ferdinand, iii, inherited, all, of, the, habsburg, lands, however, he, promptly, lost, bohemia, which, rebelled, in, 1619, and, was, briefly, 1619, 1620, under, the, rule, of, frederick, i, thus, all, the, lands, again, came, under, one, ruler, again, in, 1620, when, ferdinand, iii, invaded, bohemia, defeating, frederick, i, although, technically, an, elected, position, the, title, of, holy, roman, emperor, was, passed, down, through, maximilian, ii, and, the, two, sons, rudolf, v, and, mathias, that, succeeded, him, albert, vii, was, archduke, for, only, a, few, months, before, abdicating, in, favour, of, ferdinand, iii, who, also, became, emperor, rudolf, v, archduke, emperor, rudolf, ii, 1576, 1612, maximilian, s, eldest, son, moved, his, capital, from, vienna, to, the, safer, venue, of, prague, in, view, of, the, ottoman, threat, he, was, noted, as, a, great, patron, of, the, arts, and, sciences, but, a, poor, governor, among, his, legacies, is, the, imperial, crown, of, the, habsburgs, he, preferred, to, parcel, out, his, responsibilities, among, his, many, brothers, of, whom, six, lived, to, adulthood, leading, to, a, great, heterogeneity, of, policies, across, the, lands, among, these, delegations, was, making, his, younger, brother, mathias, governor, of, austria, in, 1593, in, acquiring, upper, austria, in, 1595, his, powers, were, considerably, increased, since, the, remaining, inner, austria, territories, were, in, the, hands, of, ferdinand, iii, who, was, only, 17, at, the, time, however, he, handed, over, the, administration, to, maximilian, iii, another, younger, brother, in, 1593, he, instigated, a, new, conflict, with, the, ottomans, who, had, resumed, raids, in, 1568, in, the, so, called, long, or, fifteen, year, war, of, 1593, to, 1606, unwilling, to, compromise, and, envisioning, a, new, crusade, the, results, were, disastrous, the, exhausted, hungarians, revolting, in, 1604, the, hungarian, problem, was, further, exacerbated, by, attempts, to, impose, a, counterreformation, there, as, a, result, he, handed, over, hungary, to, mathias, who, concluded, the, peace, of, vienna, with, the, hungarians, and, peace, of, zsitvatorok, with, the, turks, in, 1606, as, a, result, transylvania, became, both, independent, and, protestant, these, events, led, to, conflict, between, the, brothers, melchior, klesl, engineered, a, conspiracy, of, the, archdukes, to, ensure, mathias, ascendancy, by, 1608, rudolf, had, ceded, much, of, his, territory, to, the, latter, further, conflict, led, to, mathias, imprisoning, his, brother, in, 1611, who, now, gave, up, all, power, except, the, empty, title, of, emperor, dying, the, following, year, and, being, succeeded, by, mathias, thus, mathias, succeeded, to, the, archduchy, in, 1608, and, became, emperor, in, 1612, until, his, death, in, 1619, his, reign, was, marked, by, conflict, with, his, younger, brother, maximilian, iii, who, was, a, more, intransigent, catholic, and, backed, the, equally, fervent, ferdinand, ii, of, inner, austria, as, successor, having, served, as, his, regent, between, 1593, and, 1595, before, taking, over, upper, austria, the, conflicts, weakened, the, habsburgs, relative, to, both, the, estates, and, the, protestant, interests, mathias, moved, the, capital, back, to, vienna, from, prague, and, bought, further, peace, from, turkey, by, a, treaty, in, 1615, meanwhile, religious, fervor, in, the, empire, was, mounting, and, even, klesl, by, now, bishop, of, vienna, 1614, and, cardinal, 1615, was, considered, too, moderate, by, extremist, catholics, including, ferdinand, ii, war, was, in, the, air, and, the, assault, on, two, roral, officials, in, prague, on, 23, may, 1618, the, defenestration, of, prague, was, to, spark, all, out, war, mathias, like, his, brother, rudolf, became, increasingly, isolated, by, ferdinand, who, had, imprisoned, klesl, the, next, brother, in, line, for, succession, in, 1619, was, albert, vii, but, he, was, persuaded, to, step, down, in, favour, of, ferdinand, ii, within, a, few, months, religion, played, a, large, part, in, the, politics, of, this, period, and, even, tolerance, had, its, limits, faced, with, the, incompatible, demands, of, both, camps, as, the, archduke, closest, to, the, turkish, threat, maximilian, ii, was, to, continue, his, father, s, policy, of, tolerance, and, reconciliation, granting, assekuration, legalisation, of, protestantism, for, the, nobles, in, 1571, as, did, charles, ii, with, religionspazifikation, in, 1572, while, in, distant, tyrol, ferdinand, ii, could, afford, to, be, more, aggressive, maximilian, ii, s, policies, were, continued, by, his, sons, rudolf, v, and, mathias, the, strength, of, the, reformation, in, upper, austria, was, blunted, by, internal, schisms, while, in, lower, austria, melchior, khlesl, led, a, vigorous, catholic, response, expelling, protestant, preachers, and, promoting, reconversion, a, further, concession, by, charles, ii, in, 1578, the, brucker, pazifikation, met, with, more, resistance, the, catholic, revival, started, in, earnest, in, 1595, when, ferdinand, ii, who, was, jesuit, educated, came, of, age, he, had, succeeded, his, father, charles, ii, in, inner, austria, in, 1590, and, was, energetic, in, suppressing, heresy, in, the, provinces, which, he, ruled, reformation, commissions, initiated, a, process, of, forced, recatholicisation, and, by, 1600, was, being, imposed, on, graz, and, klagenfurt, unlike, previous, austrian, rulers, ferdinand, ii, was, unconcerned, about, the, effect, of, religious, conflict, on, the, ability, to, withstand, the, ottomans, the, counter, reformation, was, to, continue, to, the, end, of, the, thirty, year, war, in, 1648, when, the, ultra, pious, and, intransigent, ferdinand, ii, 1619, 1637, was, elected, emperor, as, ferdinand, ii, in, 1619, to, succeed, his, cousin, mathias, he, embarked, on, an, energetic, attempt, to, re, catholicize, not, only, the, hereditary, provinces, but, bohemia, and, habsburg, hungary, as, well, as, most, of, protestant, europe, within, the, holy, roman, empire, outside, his, lands, ferdinand, ii, s, reputation, for, strong, headed, uncompromising, intolerance, had, triggered, the, religious, thirty, years, war, in, may, 1618, in, the, polarizing, first, phase, known, as, the, revolt, in, bohemia, once, the, bohemian, revolt, had, been, put, down, in, 1620, he, embarked, on, a, concerted, effort, to, eliminate, protestantism, in, bohemia, and, austria, which, was, largely, successful, as, was, his, efforts, to, reduce, the, power, of, the, diet, the, religious, suppression, of, the, counter, reformation, reached, its, height, in, 1627, with, the, provincial, ordinance, after, several, initial, reverses, ferdinand, ii, had, become, more, accommodating, but, as, the, catholics, turned, things, around, and, began, to, enjoy, a, long, string, of, successes, at, arms, he, set, forth, the, edict, of, restitution, in, 1629, in, an, attempt, to, restore, the, status, quo, of, 1555, peace, of, augsburg, vastly, complicating, the, politics, of, settlement, negotiations, and, prolonging, the, rest, of, the, war, encouraged, by, the, mid, war, successes, ferdinand, ii, became, even, more, forceful, leading, to, infamies, by, his, armies, such, as, the, frankenburg, lottery, frankenburger, w, rfelspiel, 1625, suppression, of, the, consequent, peasants, revolt, of, 1626, and, the, sack, of, magdeburg, 1631, despite, concluding, the, peace, of, prague, 1635, with, saxony, and, hence, the, internal, or, civil, war, with, the, protestants, the, war, would, drag, on, due, to, the, intervention, of, many, foreign, states, by, the, time, of, ferdinand, ii, s, death, in, 1637, the, war, was, progressing, disastrously, for, the, habsburgs, and, his, son, ferdinand, iii, 1637, 1657, who, had, been, one, of, his, military, commanders, was, faced, with, the, task, of, salvaging, the, consequences, of, his, father, s, extremism, ferdinand, iii, was, far, more, pragmatic, and, had, been, considered, the, leader, of, the, peace, party, at, court, and, had, helped, negotiate, the, peace, of, prague, in, 1635, however, with, continuing, losses, in, the, war, he, was, forced, to, make, peace, in, 1648, with, the, peace, of, westphalia, concluding, the, war, one, of, his, acts, during, the, latter, part, of, the, war, was, to, give, further, independence, to, the, german, states, ius, belli, ac, pacis, rights, in, time, of, war, and, peace, which, would, gradually, change, the, balance, of, power, between, emperor, and, states, in, favour, of, the, latter, while, its, ultimate, causes, prove, to, be, elusive, the, war, was, to, prove, a, roller, coaster, as, habsburg, over, reach, led, to, it, spreading, from, a, domestic, dispute, to, involve, most, of, europe, and, which, while, at, times, appearing, to, aid, the, habsburg, goal, of, political, hegemony, and, religious, conformity, ultimately, eluded, them, except, in, their, own, central, territories, the, forced, conversions, or, evictions, carried, out, in, the, midst, of, the, thirty, years, war, together, with, the, later, general, success, of, the, protestants, had, greatly, negative, consequences, for, habsburg, control, of, the, holy, roman, empire, itself, although, territorial, losses, were, relatively, small, for, the, habsburgs, the, empire, was, greatly, diminished, the, power, of, the, ruler, reduced, and, the, balance, of, power, in, europe, changed, with, new, centres, emerging, on, the, empire, s, borders, the, estates, were, now, to, function, more, like, nation, states, while, deprived, of, the, goal, of, universal, monarchy, the, campaigns, within, the, habsburg, hereditary, lands, were, relatively, successful, in, religiously, purification, although, hungary, was, never, successfully, re, catholicized, only, in, lower, austria, and, only, among, the, nobility, was, protestantism, tolerated, large, numbers, of, people, either, emigrated, or, converted, while, others, compromised, as, crypto, protestants, ensuing, relative, conformity, the, crushing, of, the, bohemian, revolt, also, extinguished, czech, culture, and, established, german, as, the, tool, of, habsburg, absolutism, the, austrian, monarchs, thereafter, had, much, greater, control, within, the, hereditary, power, base, the, dynastic, absolutism, grip, was, tightened, and, the, power, of, the, estates, diminished, on, the, other, hand, austria, suffered, demographically, and, financially, therefore, becoming, less, vigorous, as, a, nation, state, the, baroque, austrian, monarchy, was, established, despite, the, dichotomy, between, outward, reality, and, inner, conviction, the, rest, of, the, world, saw, austria, as, the, epitome, of, forcible, conformity, and, conflation, of, church, and, state, in, terms, of, human, costs, the, thirty, years, wars, many, economic, social, and, population, dislocations, caused, by, the, hardline, methods, adopted, by, ferdinand, ii, s, strict, counter, reformation, measures, and, almost, continual, employment, of, mercenary, field, armies, contributed, significantly, to, the, loss, of, life, and, tragic, depopulation, of, all, the, german, states, during, a, war, which, some, estimates, put, the, civilian, loss, of, life, as, high, as, 50, overall, studies, mostly, cite, the, causes, of, death, due, to, starvation, or, as, caused, ultimately, by, the, lack, of, food, induced, weakening, of, resistance, to, endemic, diseases, which, repeatedly, reached, epidemic, proportions, among, the, general, central, european, population, the, german, states, were, the, battle, ground, and, staging, areas, for, the, largest, mercenary, armies, theretofore, and, the, armies, foraged, among, the, many, provinces, stealing, the, food, of, those, people, forced, onto, the, roads, as, refugees, or, still, on, the, lands, regardless, of, their, faith, and, allegiances, both, townsmen, and, farmers, were, repeatedly, ravaged, and, victimized, by, the, armies, on, both, sides, leaving, little, for, the, populations, already, stressed, by, the, refugees, from, the, war, or, fleeing, the, catholic, counter, reformation, repressions, under, ferdinand, s, governance, the, austrian, lands, finally, came, under, one, archduchy, in, 1620, but, ferdinand, ii, quickly, redivided, them, in, 1623, in, the, habsburg, tradition, by, parcelling, out, upper, austria, further, austria, and, tirol, to, his, younger, brother, leopold, v, 1623, 1632, who, was, already, governor, there, upper, austria, would, remain, under, leopold, s, successors, till, 1665, when, it, reverted, to, the, senior, line, under, leopold, i, leopold, v, s, son, ferdinand, charles, succeeded, him, in, upper, austria, in, 1632, however, he, was, only, four, at, the, time, leaving, his, mother, claudia, de, medici, as, regent, till, 1646, despite, the, setbacks, of, the, thirty, years, war, austria, was, able, to, recover, economically, and, demographically, and, consolidate, the, new, hegemony, often, referred, to, as, austrian, baroque, by, 1714, austria, had, become, a, great, power, again, yet, the, roots, of, habsburg, legitimacy, with, its, reliance, on, religious, and, political, conformity, was, to, make, it, increasingly, anachronistic, in, the, age, of, enlightenment, nevertheless, in, the, arts, and, architecture, the, baroque, flourished, in, austria, in, peacetime, ferdinand, iii, 1637, 1657, proved, to, be, a, great, patron, of, the, arts, and, a, musician, upon, ferdinand, s, death, in, 1657, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, leopold, i, 1657, 1705, whose, reign, was, relatively, long, meanwhile, in, upper, austria, ferdinand, charles, 1632, 1662, although, also, an, arts, patron, ruled, in, an, absolutist, and, extravagant, style, his, brother, sigismund, francis, 1662, 1665, succeeded, him, briefly, in, 1662, but, dying, without, heir, in, 1665, his, lands, reverted, to, leopold, i, thus, from, 1665, austria, was, finally, reunited, under, one, archduchy, leopold, i, s, reign, was, marked, by, a, return, to, a, succession, of, wars, even, before, he, succeeded, his, father, in, 1657, he, was, involved, in, the, second, northern, war, 1655, 1660, a, carry, over, from, sweden, s, involvement, in, the, thirty, years, war, in, which, austria, sided, with, poland, defeating, transylvania, a, swedish, ally, and, ottoman, protectorate, at, the, end, of, that, war, the, ottomans, overran, nagyv, rad, in, transylvania, in, 1660, which, would, mark, the, beginning, of, the, decline, of, that, principality, and, increasing, habsburg, influence, in, vain, the, transylvanians, appealed, to, vienna, for, help, unaware, of, secret, ottoman, habsburg, agreements, fortunately, for, austria, turkey, was, preoccupied, elsewhere, during, the, thirty, years, war, when, she, would, have, been, vulnerable, to, attack, on, her, eastern, flanks, it, was, not, until, 1663, that, the, turks, developed, serious, intentions, with, regard, to, austria, which, let, to, a, disastrous, event, for, the, ottoman, army, being, defeated, at, the, battle, of, saint, gotthard, the, following, year, the, terms, dictated, by, the, need, to, deal, with, the, french, in, the, west, were, so, disadvantageous, that, they, infuriated, the, hungarians, who, revolted, to, make, matters, worse, after, executing, the, leaders, leopold, attempted, to, impose, a, counter, reformation, starting, a, religious, civil, war, although, he, made, some, concessions, in, 1681, thus, by, the, early, 1680s, leopold, was, facing, hungarian, revolt, backed, by, the, ottomans, and, encouraged, by, the, french, on, the, opposite, flank, meanwhile, austria, became, involved, elsewhere, with, the, franco, dutch, war, 1672, 1678, which, was, concluded, with, the, treaties, of, nijmegen, giving, the, french, considerable, opportunities, indeed, the, activities, of, the, french, now, also, a, major, power, distracted, leopold, from, following, up, his, advantage, with, the, turks, and, austro, ottoman, relationships, were, governed, by, the, peace, of, vasv, r, which, would, grant, some, twenty, years, relief, however, the, reunions, bought, a, badly, needed, french, neutrality, while, austria, kept, watch, to, the, east, the, ottomans, next, moved, against, austria, in, 1682, in, retaliation, against, habsburg, raids, reaching, vienna, in, 1683, which, proved, well, fortified, and, set, about, besieging, it, the, allied, forces, eventually, proved, superior, and, the, lifting, of, the, siege, was, followed, by, a, series, of, victories, in, 1686, 1687, and, 1697, resulting, in, the, treaty, of, karlowitz, 1699, belgrade, having, fallen, in, 1688, but, recaptured, in, 1690, this, provided, austrian, hegemony, over, southern, central, europe, and, introduced, a, large, number, of, serbs, into, the, empire, who, were, to, have, a, major, impact, on, policies, over, the, ensuing, centuries, with, the, eastern, frontier, now, finally, secured, vienna, could, flourish, and, expand, beyond, its, traditional, limits, in, the, east, leopold, was, learning, that, there, was, little, to, be, gained, by, harsh, measures, which, policy, bought, his, acceptance, and, he, granted, the, hungarian, diet, rights, through, the, diploma, leopoldianum, of, 1691, however, on, the, military, front, this, merely, freed, up, austria, to, engage, in, further, western, european, wars, austria, was, becoming, more, involved, in, competition, with, france, in, western, europe, fighting, the, french, in, the, war, of, the, league, of, augsburg, 1688, 1697, on, the, domestic, front, leopold, s, reign, was, marked, by, the, expulsion, of, the, jews, from, vienna, in, 1670, the, area, being, renamed, leopoldstadt, while, in, 1680, leopold, adopted, the, so, called, pragmatica, which, re, regulated, the, relationship, between, landlord, and, peasant, most, complex, of, all, was, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, 1701, 1714, in, which, the, french, and, austrians, along, with, their, british, dutch, and, catalan, allies, fought, over, the, inheritance, of, the, vast, territories, of, the, spanish, habsburgs, the, ostensible, cause, was, the, future, charles, iii, of, austria, 1711, 1740, claiming, the, vacant, spanish, throne, in, 1701, leopold, engaged, in, the, war, but, did, not, live, to, see, its, outcome, being, succeeded, by, his, joseph, i, in, 1705, joseph, s, reign, was, short, and, the, war, finally, came, to, an, end, in, 1714, by, which, time, his, brother, charles, iii, had, succeeded, him, although, the, french, secured, control, of, spain, and, its, colonies, for, a, grandson, of, louis, xiv, the, austrians, also, ended, up, making, significant, gains, in, western, europe, including, the, former, spanish, netherlands, now, called, the, austrian, netherlands, including, most, of, modern, belgium, the, duchy, of, milan, in, northern, italy, and, naples, and, sardinia, in, southern, italy, the, latter, was, traded, for, sicily, in, 1720, by, the, conclusion, of, the, war, in, 1714, austria, had, achieved, a, pivotal, position, in, european, power, politics, the, end, of, the, war, saw, austria, s, allies, desert, her, in, terms, of, concluding, treaties, with, the, french, charles, finally, signing, off, in, the, treaty, of, rastatt, in, 1714, while, the, habsburgs, may, not, have, gained, all, they, wanted, they, still, made, significant, gains, through, both, rastatt, and, karlowitz, and, established, their, power, the, remainder, of, his, reign, saw, austria, relinquish, many, of, these, fairly, impressive, gains, largely, due, to, charles, s, apprehensions, at, the, imminent, extinction, of, the, house, of, habsburg, for, charles, now, had, succession, problems, of, his, own, having, only, two, surviving, daughters, his, solution, was, to, abolish, sole, male, inheritance, by, means, of, the, pragmatic, sanction, of, 1713, in, 1703, his, father, leopold, vi, had, made, a, pact, with, his, sons, that, allowed, for, female, inheritance, but, was, vague, on, details, and, left, room, for, uncertainty, the, pragmatic, sanction, strengthened, this, and, in, addition, made, provision, for, the, inseparability, of, the, habsburg, lands, this, was, to, form, the, legal, basis, for, the, union, with, hungary, and, to, legitimise, the, habsburg, monarchy, it, would, be, confirmed, by, the, austro, hungarian, compromise, of, 1867, and, would, last, to, 1918, he, then, needed, to, strengthen, the, arrangement, by, negotiating, with, surrounding, states, internal, negotiation, proved, to, be, relatively, simple, and, it, became, law, by, 1723, charles, was, now, willing, to, offer, concrete, advantages, in, territory, and, authority, in, exchange, for, other, powers, worthless, recognitions, of, the, pragmatic, sanction, that, made, his, daughter, maria, theresa, his, heir, equally, challenging, was, the, question, of, the, heir, apparent, s, marital, prospects, and, how, they, might, influence, the, european, balance, of, power, the, eventual, choice, of, francis, stephen, of, lorraine, in, 1736, proved, unpopular, with, the, other, powers, particularly, france, war, continued, to, be, part, of, european, life, in, the, early, 18th, century, austria, was, involved, in, the, war, of, the, quadruple, alliance, and, the, resulting, 1720, treaty, of, the, hague, was, to, see, the, habsburg, lands, reach, their, greatest, territorial, expansion, war, with, france, had, broken, out, again, in, 1733, with, the, war, of, the, polish, succession, whose, settlement, at, the, treaty, of, vienna, in, 1738, saw, austria, cede, naples, and, sicily, to, the, spanish, infante, don, carlos, in, exchange, for, the, tiny, duchy, of, parma, and, spain, and, france, s, adherence, to, the, pragmatic, sanction, the, later, years, of, charles, s, reign, also, saw, further, wars, against, the, turks, beginning, with, a, successful, skirmish, in, 1716, 1718, culminating, in, the, treaty, of, passarowitz, less, successful, was, the, war, of, 1737, 1739, which, resulted, in, the, austrian, loss, of, belgrade, and, other, border, territories, at, the, treaty, of, belgrade, on, the, domestic, front, military, and, political, gains, were, accompanied, by, economic, expansion, and, repopulation, as, austria, entered, the, period, of, high, baroque, with, a, profusion, of, new, buildings, including, the, belvedere, 1712, 1783, and, karlskirche, 1716, 1737, exemplified, by, the, great, architects, of, the, period, such, as, fischer, hildebrandt, and, prandtauer, however, the, habsburgs, finances, were, fragile, they, had, relied, on, jewish, bankers, such, as, samuel, oppenheimer, to, finance, their, wars, and, subsequently, bankrupted, him, however, the, financial, system, in, austria, remained, antiquated, and, inadequate, by, the, time, of, charles, death, in, 1740, the, treasury, was, almost, depleted, religious, intolerance, in, austria, once, unquestioned, in, the, erblande, and, the, neighbouring, catholic, territories, became, the, subject, of, more, intense, scrutiny, by, 1731, when, 22, 000, suspected, crypto, protestants, were, expelled, from, salzburg, and, the, salzkammergut, by, the, prince, archbishop, of, salzburg, similar, intolerance, was, displayed, to, the, jewish, population, in, bohemia, and, surrounding, areas, under, the, familianten, in, 1726, and, 1727, worse, would, have, followed, had, there, not, also, been, a, realisation, that, there, were, economic, consequences, and, that, some, accommodation, was, required, to, the, more, rationalist, ideas, of, western, europe, among, these, was, cameralism, which, encouraged, economic, self, sufficiency, in, the, nation, state, thus, domestic, industries, such, as, the, linzer, wollzeugfabrik, were, founded, and, encouraged, but, often, such, ideas, were, subjugated, by, vested, interests, such, as, aristocracy, and, church, rationalist, emphasis, on, the, natural, and, popular, were, the, antithesis, of, habsburg, elitism, and, divine, authority, eventually, external, powers, forced, rationalism, on, austria, by, the, time, of, his, death, in, 1740, charles, iii, had, secured, the, acceptance, of, the, pragmatic, sanction, by, most, of, the, european, powers, the, remaining, question, was, whether, it, was, realistic, in, the, complicated, power, games, of, european, dynasties, charles, iii, died, on, 20, october, 1740, and, was, succeeded, by, his, daughter, maria, theresa, however, she, did, not, become, empress, immediately, that, title, passing, to, charles, vii, 1742, 1745, the, only, moment, in, which, the, imperial, crown, passed, outside, of, the, habsburg, line, from, 1440, to, 1806, charles, vii, being, one, of, many, who, repudiated, the, 1713, pragmatic, sanction, as, many, had, anticipated, all, those, assurances, from, the, other, powers, proved, of, little, worth, to, maria, theresa, on, 16, december, 1740, prussian, troops, invaded, silesia, under, king, frederick, the, great, this, was, the, first, of, three, silesian, wars, fought, between, austria, and, prussia, in, this, period, 1740, 1742, 1744, 1745, and, 1756, 1763, soon, other, powers, began, to, exploit, austria, s, weakness, charles, vii, claimed, the, inheritance, to, the, hereditary, lands, and, bohemia, and, was, supported, by, the, king, of, france, who, desired, the, austrian, netherlands, the, spanish, and, sardinians, hoped, to, gain, territory, in, italy, and, the, saxons, hoped, to, gain, territory, to, connect, saxony, with, the, elector, s, polish, kingdom, france, even, went, so, far, as, to, prepare, for, a, partition, of, austria, austria, s, allies, britain, the, dutch, republic, and, russia, were, all, wary, of, getting, involved, in, the, conflict, ultimately, only, britain, provided, significant, support, thus, began, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, 1740, 1748, one, of, the, more, confusing, and, less, eventful, wars, of, european, history, which, ultimately, saw, austria, holding, its, own, despite, the, permanent, loss, of, most, of, silesia, to, the, prussians, that, represented, the, loss, of, one, of, its, richest, and, most, industrialised, provinces, for, austria, the, war, of, succession, was, more, a, series, of, wars, the, first, concluding, in, 1742, with, the, treaty, of, breslau, the, second, 1744, 1745, with, the, treaty, of, dresden, the, overall, war, however, continued, until, the, treaty, of, aix, la, chapelle, 1748, in, 1745, following, the, reign, of, the, bavarian, elector, as, emperor, charles, vii, maria, theresa, s, husband, francis, of, lorraine, grand, duke, of, tuscany, was, elected, emperor, restoring, control, of, that, position, to, the, habsburgs, or, rather, to, the, new, composite, house, of, habsburg, lorraine, francis, holding, the, titular, crown, until, his, death, in, 1765, but, his, empress, consort, maria, theresa, carrying, out, the, executive, functions, the, pragmatic, sanction, of, 1713, applied, to, the, hereditary, possessions, of, the, habsburgs, and, archduchy, of, austria, but, not, the, position, of, holy, roman, emperor, which, could, not, be, held, by, women, thus, maria, theresa, was, empress, consort, not, empress, regnant, for, the, eight, years, following, the, treaty, of, aix, la, chapelle, that, ended, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, maria, theresa, plotted, revenge, on, the, prussians, the, british, and, dutch, allies, who, had, proved, so, reluctant, to, help, her, in, her, time, of, need, were, dropped, in, favour, of, the, french, in, the, so, called, reversal, of, alliances, of, 1756, under, the, advice, of, kaunitz, austrian, chancellor, 1753, 1793, this, resulted, in, the, treaty, of, versailles, of, 1756, that, same, year, war, once, again, erupted, on, the, continent, as, frederick, fearing, encirclement, launched, a, pre, emptive, invasion, of, saxony, and, the, defensive, treaty, became, offensive, the, ensuing, third, silesian, war, 1756, 1763, part, of, the, larger, seven, years, war, was, indecisive, and, its, end, saw, prussia, holding, onto, silesia, despite, russia, france, and, austria, all, combining, against, him, and, with, only, hanover, as, a, significant, ally, on, land, the, end, of, the, war, saw, austria, poorly, prepared, at, its, start, exhausted, austria, continued, the, alliance, with, france, cemented, in, 1770, with, the, marriage, of, maria, theresa, s, daughter, archduchess, maria, antonia, to, the, dauphin, but, also, facing, a, dangerous, situation, in, central, europe, faced, with, the, alliance, of, frederick, the, great, of, prussia, and, catherine, the, great, of, russia, the, russo, turkish, war, of, 1768, 1774, caused, a, serious, crisis, in, east, central, europe, with, prussia, and, austria, demanding, compensation, for, russia, s, gains, in, the, balkans, ultimately, leading, to, the, first, partition, of, poland, in, 1772, in, which, maria, theresa, took, galicia, from, austria, s, traditional, ally, over, the, next, several, years, austro, russian, relations, began, to, improve, when, the, war, of, bavarian, succession, 1778, 1779, erupted, between, austria, and, prussia, following, the, extinction, of, the, bavarian, line, of, the, wittelsbach, dynasty, russia, refused, to, support, austria, its, ally, from, the, seven, years, war, but, offered, to, mediate, and, the, war, was, ended, after, almost, no, bloodshed, on, 13, may, 1779, when, russian, and, french, mediators, at, the, congress, of, teschen, negotiated, an, end, to, the, war, in, the, agreement, austria, received, the, innviertel, from, bavaria, but, for, austria, it, was, a, case, of, status, quo, ante, bellum, this, war, was, unusual, for, this, era, in, that, casualties, from, disease, and, starvation, exceeded, wounds, and, is, considered, the, last, of, the, cabinet, wars, in, which, diplomats, played, as, large, a, part, as, troops, and, as, the, roots, of, german, dualism, austria, prussia, rivalry, although, maria, theresa, and, her, consort, were, baroque, absolutist, conservatives, this, was, tempered, by, a, pragmatic, sense, and, they, implemented, a, number, of, overdue, reforms, thus, these, reforms, were, pragmatic, responses, to, the, challenges, faced, by, archduchy, and, empire, not, ideologically, framed, in, the, age, of, enlightenment, as, seen, by, her, successor, joseph, ii, the, collision, with, other, theories, of, nation, states, and, modernity, obliged, austria, to, perform, a, delicate, balancing, act, between, accepting, changing, economic, and, social, circumstances, while, rejecting, their, accompanying, political, change, the, relative, failure, to, deal, with, modernity, produced, major, changes, in, habsburg, power, and, austrian, culture, and, society, one, of, the, first, challenges, that, maria, theresa, and, her, advisers, faced, was, to, restore, the, legitimacy, and, authority, of, the, dynasty, although, was, slowly, replaced, by, a, need, to, establish, the, needs, of, state, maria, theresa, promulgated, financial, and, educational, reforms, with, the, assistance, of, her, advisers, notably, count, friedrich, wilhelm, von, haugwitz, and, gerard, van, swieten, many, reforms, were, in, the, interests, of, efficiency, her, financial, reforms, considerably, improved, the, state, finances, and, notably, introduced, taxation, of, the, nobility, for, the, first, time, and, achieved, a, balanced, budget, by, 1775, at, an, administrative, level, under, haugwitz, she, centralised, administration, previously, left, to, the, nobility, and, church, along, prussian, models, with, a, permanent, civil, service, haugwitz, was, appointed, head, of, the, new, directorium, in, publicis, und, cameralibus, in, 1749, by, 1760, it, was, clear, this, was, not, solving, austria, s, problems, and, further, reform, was, required, kaunitz, proposal, for, a, consultative, body, was, accepted, by, maria, theresa, this, council, of, state, was, to, be, based, on, the, french, conseil, d, tat, which, believed, that, an, absolutist, monarch, could, still, be, guided, by, enlightenment, advisors, the, council, was, inaugurated, in, january, 1761, composed, of, kaunitz, the, state, chancellor, three, members, of, the, high, nobility, including, von, haugwitz, as, chair, and, three, knights, which, served, as, a, committee, of, experienced, people, who, advised, her, the, council, of, state, lacked, executive, or, legislative, authority, this, marked, kaunitz, ascendency, over, von, haugwitz, the, directory, was, abolished, and, its, functions, absorbed, into, the, new, united, austrian, and, bohemian, chancelleries, b, hmisch, sterreichische, hofkanzlei, in, 1761, while, von, haugwitz, modernised, the, army, and, government, van, swieten, reformed, health, care, and, education, educational, reform, included, that, of, vienna, university, by, swieten, from, 1749, the, founding, of, the, theresianum, 1746, as, a, civil, service, academy, as, well, as, military, and, foreign, service, academies, an, education, commission, was, established, in, 1760, with, a, specific, interest, in, replacing, jesuitical, control, but, it, was, the, papal, dissolution, of, the, order, in, 1773, that, accomplished, this, the, confiscation, of, their, property, enabled, the, next, step, aware, of, the, inadequacy, of, bureaucracy, in, austria, and, in, order, to, improve, it, maria, theresa, and, what, was, now, referred, to, as, the, party, of, enlightenment, radically, overhauled, the, schools, system, in, the, new, system, based, on, the, prussian, one, all, children, of, both, genders, from, the, ages, of, 6, to, 12, had, to, attend, school, while, teacher, training, schools, were, established, education, reform, was, met, with, hostility, from, many, villages, and, the, nobility, to, whom, children, represented, labour, maria, theresa, crushed, the, dissent, by, ordering, the, arrest, of, all, those, opposed, although, the, idea, had, merit, the, reforms, were, not, as, successful, as, they, were, expected, to, be, in, some, parts, of, austria, half, of, the, population, was, illiterate, well, into, the, 19th, century, however, widespread, access, to, education, education, in, the, vernacular, language, replacement, of, rote, learning, and, blind, obedience, with, reasoning, was, to, have, a, profound, effect, on, the, relationship, between, people, and, state, other, reforms, were, in, civil, rights, which, were, defied, under, the, codex, theresianus, begun, in, 1752, and, finished, in, 1766, specific, measures, included, abolition, of, torture, and, witch, burning, also, in, industrial, and, agrarian, policy, along, cameralist, lines, the, theory, was, to, maximise, the, resources, of, the, land, to, protect, the, integrity, of, the, state, widespread, problems, arising, from, war, famine, unrest, and, abuse, made, implementation, of, landlord, peasant, reforms, both, reasonable, and, reasonable, maria, theresa, and, her, regime, had, sought, a, new, more, direct, link, with, the, populace, now, that, administration, was, no, longer, to, be, farmed, out, and, this, maternalism, combined, with, cameralist, thinking, required, taking, a, closer, interest, in, the, welfare, of, the, peasantry, and, their, protection, which, transpired, in, the, 1750s, however, these, had, been, more, noted, than, observed, in, the, 1770s, more, meaningful, control, of, rents, became, practical, further, eroding, privilege, while, reforms, assisted, austria, in, dealing, with, the, almost, constant, wars, the, wars, themselves, hindered, the, implementation, of, those, reforms, a, pious, catholic, her, reforms, which, affected, the, relation, between, state, and, church, in, favour, of, the, former, did, not, extend, to, any, relaxation, of, religious, intolerance, but, she, preempted, pope, clement, xiv, s, suppression, of, the, jesuits, in, 1773, by, issuing, a, decree, which, removed, them, from, all, the, institutions, of, the, monarchy, there, was, both, a, suspicion, of, their, excesses, and, of, their, tendency, to, political, interference, which, brought, them, into, conflict, with, the, progressive, secularisation, of, culture, thus, they, were, removed, from, control, of, censorship, in, 1751, and, the, educational, reforms, threatened, their, control, over, education, she, was, hostile, to, jews, and, protestants, but, eventually, abandoned, efforts, for, conversion, but, continued, her, father, s, campaign, to, exile, crypto, protestants, mainly, to, transylvania, as, in, 1750, in, 1744, she, even, ordered, the, expulsion, of, jews, but, relented, under, pressure, by, 1748, in, her, later, years, though, she, took, some, measures, to, protect, the, jewish, population, maria, theresa, had, a, large, family, sixteen, in, all, of, whom, six, were, daughters, that, lived, to, adulthood, they, were, only, too, aware, that, their, fate, was, to, be, used, as, political, pawns, the, best, known, of, these, was, the, tragic, figure, of, maria, antonia, 1755, 1793, when, maria, theresa, s, consort, francis, died, in, 1765, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, joseph, ii, as, emperor, 1765, 1790, because, of, male, primogeniture, joseph, was, also, made, co, ruler, or, co, regent, with, his, mother, joseph, 24, at, the, time, was, more, ideologically, attuned, to, modernity, and, frequently, disagreed, with, his, mother, on, policy, and, was, often, excluded, from, policy, making, maria, theresa, always, acted, with, a, cautious, respect, for, the, conservatism, of, the, political, and, social, elites, and, the, strength, of, local, traditions, her, cautious, approach, repelled, joseph, who, always, sought, the, decisive, dramatic, intervention, to, impose, the, one, best, solution, regardless, of, traditions, or, political, opposition, joseph, and, his, mother, s, quarrels, were, usually, mediated, by, chancellor, wenzel, anton, von, kaunitz, who, served, for, nearly, 40, years, as, the, principal, minister, to, both, maria, theresa, and, joseph, joseph, frequently, used, his, position, as, leverage, by, threatening, resignation, the, one, area, he, was, allowed, more, say, on, was, in, foreign, policy, in, this, he, showed, similar, traits, to, austria, s, arch, enemy, frederick, ii, of, prussia, 1740, 1786, also, his, intellectual, model, he, was, successful, in, siding, with, kaunitz, in, realpolitik, undertaking, the, first, partition, of, poland, in, 1772, over, his, mother, s, principled, objections, however, his, enthusiasm, for, interfering, in, bavarian, politics, by, invoking, his, ties, to, his, former, brother, in, law, maximilian, iii, ended, austria, in, the, war, of, bavarian, succession, in, 1778, although, largely, shut, out, of, domestic, policy, he, used, his, time, to, acquire, knowledge, of, his, lands, and, people, encouraged, policies, he, was, in, accord, with, and, made, magnanimous, gestures, such, as, opening, the, royal, parks, of, prater, and, augarten, to, the, public, in, 1766, and, 1775, alles, f, r, das, volk, nichts, durch, das, volk, everything, for, the, people, nothing, by, the, people, on, her, husband, s, death, maria, theresa, was, therefore, no, longer, empress, the, title, of, which, fell, to, her, daughter, in, law, maria, josepha, of, bavaria, until, her, death, in, 1767, when, the, title, fell, vacant, when, maria, theresa, died, in, 1780, she, was, succeeded, in, all, her, titles, by, joseph, ii, as, the, first, of, the, habsburg, lorraine, habsburg, lothringen, dynasty, joseph, ii, was, the, archetypical, embodiment, of, the, enlightenment, spirit, of, the, 18th, century, reforming, monarchs, known, as, the, enlightened, despots, when, his, mother, maria, theresa, died, in, 1780, joseph, became, the, absolute, ruler, over, the, most, extensive, realm, of, central, europe, there, was, no, parliament, to, deal, with, joseph, was, always, positive, that, the, rule, of, reason, as, propounded, in, the, enlightenment, would, produce, the, best, possible, results, in, the, shortest, time, he, issued, edicts, 6, 000, in, all, plus, 11, 000, new, laws, designed, to, regulate, and, reorder, every, aspect, of, the, empire, the, spirit, was, benevolent, and, paternal, he, intended, to, make, his, people, happy, but, strictly, in, accordance, with, his, own, criteria, josephinism, or, josephism, as, his, policies, were, called, is, notable, for, the, very, wide, range, of, reforms, designed, to, modernize, the, creaky, empire, in, an, era, when, france, and, prussia, were, rapidly, upgrading, josephinism, elicited, grudging, compliance, at, best, and, more, often, vehement, opposition, from, all, sectors, in, every, part, of, his, empire, failure, characterized, most, of, his, projects, joseph, set, about, building, a, rational, centralized, and, uniform, government, for, his, diverse, lands, a, pyramid, with, himself, as, supreme, autocrat, he, expected, government, servants, to, all, be, dedicated, agents, of, josephinism, and, selected, them, without, favor, for, class, or, ethnic, origins, promotion, was, solely, by, merit, to, impose, uniformity, he, made, german, the, compulsory, language, of, official, business, throughout, the, empire, the, hungarian, assembly, was, stripped, of, its, prerogatives, and, not, even, called, together, as, president, of, the, court, audit, office, count, karl, von, zinzendorf, 1781, 1792, introduced, appalt, a, uniform, system, of, accounting, for, state, revenues, expenditures, and, debts, of, the, territories, of, the, austrian, crown, austria, was, more, successful, than, france, in, meeting, regular, expenditures, and, in, gaining, credit, however, the, events, of, joseph, ii, s, last, years, also, suggest, that, the, government, was, financially, vulnerable, to, the, european, wars, that, ensued, after, 1792, joseph, reformed, the, traditional, legal, system, abolished, brutal, punishments, and, the, death, penalty, in, most, instances, and, imposed, the, principle, of, complete, equality, of, treatment, for, all, offenders, he, ended, censorship, of, the, press, and, theatre, to, equalize, the, incidence, of, taxation, joseph, ordered, a, fresh, appraisal, of, the, value, of, all, properties, in, the, empire, his, goal, was, to, impose, a, single, and, egalitarian, tax, on, land, the, goal, was, to, modernize, the, relationship, of, dependence, between, the, landowners, and, peasantry, relieve, some, of, the, tax, burden, on, the, peasantry, and, increase, state, revenues, joseph, looked, on, the, tax, and, land, reforms, as, being, interconnected, and, strove, to, implement, them, at, the, same, time, the, various, commissions, he, established, to, formulate, and, carry, out, the, reforms, met, resistance, among, the, nobility, the, peasantry, and, some, officials, most, of, the, reforms, were, abrogated, shortly, before, or, after, joseph, s, death, in, 1790, they, were, doomed, to, failure, from, the, start, because, they, tried, to, change, too, much, in, too, short, a, time, and, tried, to, radically, alter, the, traditional, customs, and, relationships, that, the, villagers, had, long, depended, upon, in, the, cities, the, new, economic, principles, of, the, enlightenment, called, for, the, destruction, of, the, autonomous, guilds, already, weakened, during, the, age, of, mercantilism, joseph, ii, s, tax, reforms, and, the, institution, of, katastralgemeinde, tax, districts, for, the, large, estates, served, this, purpose, and, new, factory, privileges, ended, guild, rights, while, customs, laws, aimed, at, economic, unity, the, intellectual, influence, of, the, physiocrats, led, to, the, inclusion, of, agriculture, in, these, reforms, in, 1781, 82, he, extended, full, legal, freedom, to, serfs, rentals, paid, by, peasants, were, to, be, regulated, by, imperial, not, local, officials, and, taxes, were, levied, upon, all, income, derived, from, land, the, landlords, saw, a, grave, threat, to, their, status, and, incomes, and, eventually, reversed, the, policy, in, hungary, and, transylvania, the, resistance, of, the, landed, nobility, was, so, great, that, joseph, compromised, with, halfway, measures, one, of, the, few, times, he, backed, down, after, the, great, peasant, revolt, of, horea, 1784, 85, however, the, emperor, imposed, his, will, by, fiat, his, imperial, patent, of, 1785, abolished, serfdom, but, did, not, give, the, peasants, ownership, of, the, land, or, freedom, from, dues, owed, to, the, landowning, nobles, it, did, give, them, personal, freedom, emancipation, of, the, hungarian, peasantry, promoted, the, growth, of, a, new, class, of, taxable, landholders, but, it, did, not, abolish, the, deep, seated, ills, of, feudalism, and, the, exploitation, of, the, landless, squatters, capital, punishment, was, abolished, in, 1787, although, restored, in, 1795, legal, reforms, gained, comprehensive, austrian, form, in, the, civil, code, abgb, allgemeine, b, rgerliche, gesetzbuch, of, 1811, and, have, been, seen, as, providing, a, foundation, for, subsequent, reforms, extending, into, the, 20th, century, the, first, part, of, the, abgb, appeared, in, 1786, and, the, criminal, code, in, 1787, these, reforms, incorporated, the, criminological, writings, of, cesare, beccaria, but, also, first, time, made, all, people, equal, in, the, eyes, of, the, law, to, produce, a, literate, citizenry, elementary, education, was, made, compulsory, for, all, boys, and, girls, and, higher, education, on, practical, lines, was, offered, for, a, select, few, he, created, scholarships, for, talented, poor, students, and, allowed, the, establishment, of, schools, for, jews, and, other, religious, minorities, in, 1784, he, ordered, that, the, country, change, its, language, of, instruction, from, latin, to, german, a, highly, controversial, step, in, a, multilingual, empire, by, the, 18th, century, centralization, was, the, trend, in, medicine, because, more, and, better, educated, doctors, requesting, improved, facilities, cities, lacked, the, budgets, to, fund, local, hospitals, and, the, monarchies, wanted, to, end, costly, epidemics, and, quarantines, joseph, attempted, to, centralize, medical, care, in, vienna, through, the, construction, of, a, single, large, hospital, the, famous, allgemeines, krankenhaus, which, opened, in, 1784, centralization, worsened, sanitation, problems, causing, epidemics, a, 20, death, rate, in, the, new, hospital, which, undercut, joseph, s, plan, but, the, city, became, preeminent, in, the, medical, field, in, the, next, century, joseph, s, catholicism, was, that, of, catholic, reform, and, his, goals, were, to, weaken, the, power, of, the, catholic, church, and, introduce, a, policy, of, religious, toleration, that, was, the, most, advanced, of, any, state, in, europe, in, 1789, he, issued, a, charter, of, religious, toleration, for, the, jews, of, galicia, a, region, with, a, large, yiddish, speaking, traditional, jewish, population, the, charter, abolished, communal, autonomy, whereby, the, jews, controlled, their, internal, affairs, it, promoted, germanization, and, the, wearing, of, non, jewish, clothing, probably, the, most, unpopular, of, all, his, reforms, was, his, attempted, modernization, of, the, highly, traditional, roman, catholic, church, calling, himself, the, guardian, of, catholicism, joseph, ii, struck, vigorously, at, papal, power, he, tried, to, make, the, catholic, church, in, his, empire, the, tool, of, the, state, independent, of, rome, clergymen, were, deprived, of, the, tithe, and, ordered, to, study, in, seminaries, under, government, supervision, while, bishops, had, to, take, a, formal, oath, of, loyalty, to, the, crown, he, financed, the, large, increase, in, bishoprics, parishes, and, secular, clergy, by, extensive, sales, of, monastic, lands, as, a, man, of, the, enlightenment, he, ridiculed, the, contemplative, monastic, orders, which, he, considered, unproductive, as, opposed, to, the, service, orders, accordingly, he, suppressed, a, of, the, monasteries, over, 700, were, closed, and, reduced, the, number, of, monks, and, nuns, from, 65, 000, to, 27, 000, church, courts, were, abolished, and, marriage, was, defined, as, a, civil, contract, outside, the, jurisdiction, of, the, church, joseph, sharply, cut, the, number, of, holy, days, and, reduced, ornamentation, in, churches, he, greatly, simplified, the, manner, of, celebration, critics, alleged, that, these, reforms, caused, a, crisis, of, faith, reduced, piety, and, a, decline, in, morality, had, protestant, tendencies, promoted, enlightenment, rationalism, and, a, class, of, liberal, bourgeois, officials, and, led, to, the, emergence, and, persistence, of, anti, clericalism, many, traditional, catholics, were, energized, in, opposition, to, the, emperor, the, habsburg, empire, developed, a, policy, of, war, and, trade, as, well, as, intellectual, influence, across, the, borders, while, opposing, prussia, and, turkey, austria, was, friendly, to, russia, though, tried, to, remove, romania, from, russian, influence, in, foreign, policy, there, was, no, enlightenment, only, hunger, for, more, territory, and, a, willingness, to, undertake, unpopular, wars, to, get, the, land, joseph, was, a, belligerent, expansionist, leader, who, dreamed, of, making, his, empire, the, greatest, of, the, european, powers, joseph, s, plan, was, to, acquire, bavaria, if, necessary, in, exchange, for, belgium, the, austrian, netherlands, thwarted, by, king, frederick, ii, of, prussia, in, 1778, in, the, war, of, bavarian, succession, he, renewed, his, efforts, again, in, 1785, but, prussian, diplomacy, proved, more, powerful, this, failure, caused, joseph, to, seek, territorial, expansion, in, the, balkans, where, he, became, involved, in, an, expensive, and, futile, war, with, the, turks, 1787, 1791, which, was, the, price, to, be, paid, for, friendship, with, russia, the, balkan, policy, of, both, maria, theresa, and, joseph, ii, reflected, the, cameralism, promoted, by, prince, kaunitz, stressing, consolidation, of, the, border, lands, by, reorganization, and, expansion, of, the, military, frontier, transylvania, had, been, incorporated, into, the, frontier, in, 1761, and, the, frontier, regiments, became, the, backbone, of, the, military, order, with, the, regimental, commander, exercising, military, and, civilian, power, populationistik, was, the, prevailing, theory, of, colonization, which, measured, prosperity, in, terms, of, labor, joseph, ii, also, stressed, economic, development, habsburg, influence, was, an, essential, factor, in, balkan, development, in, the, last, half, of, the, 18th, century, especially, for, the, serbs, and, croats, the, nobility, throughout, his, empire, disliked, joseph, s, taxes, egalitarianism, despotism, and, puritanism, in, belgium, and, hungary, his, attempts, to, subordinate, everything, to, his, own, personal, rule, in, vienna, were, not, well, received, even, commoners, were, affected, by, joseph, s, reforms, such, as, a, ban, on, baking, gingerbread, because, joseph, thought, it, bad, for, the, stomach, or, a, ban, on, corsets, only, a, few, weeks, before, joseph, s, death, the, director, of, the, imperial, police, reported, to, him, all, classes, and, even, those, who, have, the, greatest, respect, for, the, sovereign, are, discontented, and, indignant, in, lombardy, in, northern, italy, the, cautious, reforms, of, maria, theresa, in, lombardy, had, enjoyed, support, from, local, reformers, joseph, ii, however, by, creating, a, powerful, imperial, officialdom, directed, from, vienna, undercut, the, dominant, position, of, the, milanese, principate, and, the, traditions, of, jurisdiction, and, administration, in, the, place, of, provincial, autonomy, he, established, an, unlimited, centralism, which, reduced, lombardy, politically, and, economically, to, a, fringe, area, of, the, empire, as, a, reaction, to, these, radical, changes, the, middle, class, reformers, shifted, away, from, cooperation, to, strong, resistance, from, this, basis, appeared, the, beginnings, of, the, later, lombard, liberalism, by, 1788, joseph, s, health, but, not, his, determination, was, failing, by, 1789, rebellion, had, broken, out, in, protest, against, his, reforms, in, belgium, brabant, revolution, and, hungary, and, his, other, dominions, were, restive, under, the, burdens, of, his, war, with, turkey, his, empire, was, threatened, with, dissolution, and, he, was, forced, to, sacrifice, some, of, his, reform, projects, the, emperor, died, on, 20, february, 1790, at, 48, mostly, unsuccessful, in, his, attempts, to, curtail, feudal, liberties, behind, his, numerous, reforms, lay, a, comprehensive, program, influenced, by, the, doctrines, of, enlightened, absolutism, natural, law, mercantilism, and, physiocracy, with, a, goal, of, establishing, a, uniform, legal, framework, to, replace, heterogeneous, traditional, structures, the, reforms, were, guided, at, least, implicitly, by, the, principles, of, freedom, and, equality, and, were, based, on, a, conception, of, the, state, s, central, legislative, authority, joseph, s, accession, marks, a, major, break, since, the, preceding, reforms, under, maria, theresa, had, not, challenged, these, structures, but, there, was, no, similar, break, at, the, end, of, the, josephinian, era, the, reforms, initiated, by, joseph, ii, had, merit, despite, the, way, they, were, introduced, they, were, continued, to, varying, degrees, under, his, successors, they, have, been, seen, as, providing, a, foundation, for, subsequent, reforms, extending, into, the, 20th, century, upon, his, death, in, 1790, joseph, was, briefly, succeeded, by, his, younger, brother, leopold, vii, joseph, s, death, proved, a, boon, for, austria, as, he, was, succeeded, by, his, younger, brother, leopold, ii, previously, the, more, cautiously, reforming, grand, duke, of, tuscany, leopold, knew, when, to, cut, his, losses, and, soon, cut, deals, with, the, revolting, netherlanders, and, hungarians, he, also, managed, to, secure, a, peace, with, turkey, in, 1791, and, negotiated, an, alliance, with, prussia, which, had, been, allying, with, poland, to, press, for, war, on, behalf, of, the, ottomans, against, austria, and, russia, while, restoring, relative, calm, to, what, had, been, a, crisis, situation, on, his, accession, in, 1790, austria, was, surrounded, by, potential, threats, while, many, reforms, were, by, necessity, rescinded, other, reforms, were, initiated, including, more, freedom, of, the, press, and, restriction, on, the, powers, of, the, police, he, replaced, his, brother, s, police, minister, johann, anton, von, pergen, with, joseph, sonnenfels, an, advocate, of, social, welfare, rather, than, control, leopold, s, reign, also, saw, the, acceleration, of, the, french, revolution, although, leopold, was, sympathetic, to, the, revolutionaries, he, was, also, the, brother, of, the, french, queen, furthermore, disputes, involving, the, status, of, the, rights, of, various, imperial, princes, in, alsace, where, the, revolutionary, french, government, was, attempting, to, remove, rights, guaranteed, by, various, peace, treaties, involved, leopold, as, emperor, in, conflicts, with, the, french, the, declaration, of, pillnitz, made, in, late, 1791, jointly, with, the, prussian, king, frederick, william, ii, and, the, elector, of, saxony, in, which, it, was, declared, that, the, other, princes, of, europe, took, an, interest, in, what, was, going, on, in, france, was, intended, to, be, a, statement, in, support, of, louis, xvi, that, would, prevent, the, need, from, taking, any, kind, of, action, however, it, instead, inflamed, the, sentiments, of, the, revolutionaries, against, the, emperor, although, leopold, did, his, best, to, avoid, war, with, the, french, he, died, in, march, 1792, the, french, declared, war, on, his, inexperienced, eldest, son, francis, ii, a, month, later, vienna, and, austria, dominated, european, music, during, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, typified, by, the, first, viennese, school, this, was, the, era, of, haydn, and, mozart, s, vienna, period, extended, from, 1781, to, 1791, during, which, he, was, court, composer, opera, particularly, german, opera, was, flourishing, mozart, wrote, many, german, operas, including, the, magic, flute, initially, the, pillars, of, the, establishment, the, monarchy, such, as, joseph, ii, and, to, a, lesser, extent, his, mother, the, aristocracy, and, the, religious, establishment, were, the, major, patrons, of, the, arts, until, rising, middle, class, aspirations, incorporated, music, into, the, lives, of, the, bourgeoisie, meanwhile, the, baroque, was, evolving, into, the, less, grandiose, form, the, rococo, the, virtual, abolition, of, censorship, under, van, swieten, also, encouraged, artistic, expression, and, the, themes, of, artistic, work, often, reflected, enlightenment, thinking, francis, ii, 1792, 1835, was, only, 24, when, he, succeeded, his, father, leopold, vii, in, 1792, but, was, to, reign, for, nearly, half, a, century, and, a, radical, reorganisation, of, european, politics, he, inherited, a, vast, bureaucracy, created, by, his,

monarch, and, subject, his, era, was, overshadowed, by, events, in, france, both, in, terms, of, the, evolving, revolution, and, the, onset, of, a, new, form, of, european, warfare, with, mass, citizen, armies, austria, recoiled, in, horror, at, the, execution, of, francis, aunt, maria, antonia, in, 1793, despite, futile, attempts, at, rescue, and, even, negotiation, for, release, leading, to, a, wave, of, repression, to, fend, off, such, dangerous, sentiments, influencing, austrian, politics, at, the, same, time, europe, was, consumed, by, the, french, revolutionary, 1792, 1802, and, napoleonic, wars, 1803, 1815, the, french, revolution, effectively, ended, austria, s, experiment, with, modernity, and, reform, from, above, and, marked, a, retreat, to, legitimacy, francis, started, out, cautiously, the, bureaucracy, was, still, josephist, and, the, legal, reforms, under, the, guidance, of, sonnenfels, resulting, in, the, criminal, code, of, 1803, and, the, civil, code, of, 1811, on, the, other, hand, he, restored, pergen, to, his, position, of, chief, of, police, the, discovery, of, a, jacobin, plot, in, 1794, was, a, catalyst, to, the, onset, of, repression, the, leaders, were, executed, or, imprisoned, but, there, was, little, evidence, of, a, tangible, threat, to, the, habsburgs, suppression, of, dissent, with, the, recensorship, commission, of, 1803, created, a, void, in, cultural, and, intellectual, life, yet, some, of, the, world, s, greatest, music, comes, from, this, time, see, below, there, were, still, elements, of, josephism, abroad, and, stadion, the, foreign, minister, with, his, propagandist, friedrich, von, gentz, was, able, to, appeal, to, popular, nationalism, to, defeat, napoleon, what, exactly, such, nationalism, actually, represented, is, difficult, to, precisely, identify, certainly, it, was, directed, to, german, culture, within, the, habsburg, lands, but, it, is, not, clear, to, what, degree, it, differentiated, between, austrian, and, german, certainly, many, of, those, such, nationalism, appealed, to, were, german, romantics, such, as, karl, wilhelm, friedrich, schlegel, such, that, patriotism, rather, than, true, nationalism, appeared, to, be, the, goal, cultural, museums, were, established, and, citizens, militia, established, but, in, the, german, speaking, lands, josephism, remained, alive, and, well, in, the, other, members, of, francis, generation, archduke, johann, 1782, 1859, was, a, nationalism, advocate, who, was, behind, the, landwehr, movement, and, with, joseph, hormayr, incited, revolt, in, bavarian, occupied, tyrol, while, archduke, charles, carried, out, reform, of, the, military, a, statue, to, joseph, was, even, set, up, in, josephsplatz, in, 1807, to, rally, the, populace, in, this, way, the, archdukes, centralism, contrasted, with, stadion, s, decentralisation, and, attempt, to, give, more, say, to, the, estates, nevertheless, such, nationalism, was, successful, in, rebuilding, austria, throughout, its, various, military, and, political, setbacks, of, the, french, wars, following, austria, s, resounding, defeat, in, 1809, francis, blamed, reform, and, removed, the, archdukes, from, their, position, stadion, was, replaced, by, metternich, who, although, a, reformer, placed, loyalty, to, the, monarch, above, all, the, landwehr, was, abolished, and, following, the, discovery, of, yet, another, planned, tyrolean, uprising, hormayr, and, archduke, johann, were, interned, and, johann, exiled, to, styria, france, declared, war, on, austria, on, 20, april, 1792, the, increasing, radicalization, of, the, french, revolution, including, the, execution, of, the, king, on, 21, january, 1793, as, well, as, the, french, occupation, of, the, low, countries, brought, britain, the, dutch, republic, and, spain, into, the, war, which, became, known, as, the, war, of, the, first, coalition, this, first, war, with, france, which, lasted, until, 1797, proved, unsuccessful, for, austria, after, some, brief, successes, against, the, utterly, disorganized, french, armies, in, early, 1792, the, tide, turned, and, the, french, overran, the, austrian, netherlands, in, the, last, months, of, 1792, by, the, battle, of, valmy, in, september, it, was, evident, to, austria, and, their, prussian, allies, that, victory, against, france, would, elude, them, and, austria, suffered, a, further, defeat, in, november, at, jemappes, losing, the, austrian, netherlands, belgium, while, the, austrians, were, so, occupied, their, erstwhile, prussian, allies, stabbed, them, in, the, back, with, the, 1793, second, partition, of, poland, from, which, austria, was, entirely, excluded, this, led, to, the, dismissal, of, francis, s, chief, minister, philipp, von, cobenzl, and, his, replacement, with, franz, maria, thugut, in, march, 1793, once, again, there, were, initial, successes, against, the, disorganized, armies, of, the, french, republic, in, 1793, and, the, netherlands, were, recovered, but, in, 1794, the, tide, turned, once, more, and, austrian, forces, were, driven, out, of, the, netherlands, again, this, time, for, good, meanwhile, the, polish, crisis, again, became, critical, resulting, in, a, third, partition, 1795, in, which, austria, managed, to, secure, important, gains, the, war, in, the, west, continued, to, go, badly, as, most, of, the, coalition, made, peace, leaving, austria, with, only, britain, and, piedmont, sardinia, as, allies, in, 1796, the, french, directory, planned, a, two, pronged, campaign, in, germany, to, force, the, austrians, to, make, peace, with, a, secondary, thrust, planned, into, italy, french, forces, entered, bavaria, and, the, edge, of, the, tyrol, before, encountering, austrian, forces, under, archduke, charles, the, emperor, s, brother, at, amberg, 24, august, 1796, who, was, successful, in, driving, the, french, back, in, germany, meanwhile, the, french, army, of, italy, under, the, command, of, the, young, corsican, general, napoleon, bonaparte, was, brilliantly, successful, forcing, piedmont, out, of, the, war, driving, the, austrians, out, of, lombardy, and, besieging, mantua, following, the, capture, of, mantua, in, early, 1797, bonaparte, advanced, north, through, the, alps, against, vienna, while, new, french, armies, moved, again, into, germany, austria, sued, for, peace, by, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, campo, formio, of, 1797, austria, renounced, its, claims, to, the, netherlands, and, lombardy, in, exchange, for, which, it, was, granted, the, territories, of, the, republic, of, venice, with, the, french, the, austrians, also, provisionally, recognized, the, french, annexation, of, the, left, bank, of, the, rhine, and, agreed, in, principle, that, the, german, princes, of, the, region, should, be, compensated, with, ecclesiastical, lands, on, the, other, side, of, the, rhine, the, peace, did, not, last, for, long, soon, differences, emerged, between, the, austrians, and, french, over, the, reorganization, of, germany, and, austria, joined, russia, britain, and, naples, in, the, war, of, the, second, coalition, in, 1799, although, austro, russian, forces, were, initially, successful, in, driving, the, french, from, italy, the, tide, soon, turned, the, russians, withdrew, from, the, war, after, a, defeat, at, z, rich, 1799, which, they, blamed, on, austrian, recklessness, and, the, austrians, were, defeated, by, bonaparte, who, was, now, the, first, consul, at, marengo, which, forced, them, to, withdraw, from, italy, and, then, in, germany, at, hohenlinden, these, defeats, forced, thugut, s, resignation, and, austria, now, led, by, ludwig, cobenzl, to, make, peace, at, lun, ville, in, early, 1801, the, terms, were, mild, the, terms, of, campo, formio, were, largely, reinstated, but, now, the, way, was, clear, for, a, reorganization, of, the, empire, on, french, lines, by, the, imperial, deputation, report, of, 1803, the, holy, roman, empire, was, entirely, reorganized, with, nearly, all, of, the, ecclesiastical, territories, and, free, cities, traditionally, the, parts, of, the, empire, most, friendly, to, the, house, of, austria, eliminated, with, bonaparte, s, assumption, of, the, title, of, emperor, of, the, first, french, empire, on, 18, may, 1804, francis, ii, seeing, the, writing, on, the, wall, for, the, old, empire, and, arbitrarily, took, the, new, title, of, emperor, of, austria, as, francis, i, in, addition, to, his, title, of, holy, roman, emperor, this, earned, him, the, title, of, double, emperor, francis, ii, of, the, holy, roman, empire, francis, i, of, austria, the, arrival, of, a, new, french, emperor, on, the, scene, and, the, restructuring, of, the, old, presented, a, larger, threat, to, the, habsburgs, than, their, territorial, losses, to, date, for, there, was, no, longer, any, certainty, that, they, would, continue, to, be, elected, francis, had, himself, made, emperor, of, the, new, austrian, empire, on, 11, august, not, long, after, napoleon, the, new, empire, referred, to, not, a, new, state, but, to, the, lands, ruled, by, austria, that, is, the, habsburgs, which, was, effectively, many, states, soon, napoleon, s, continuing, machinations, in, italy, including, the, annexation, of, genoa, and, parma, led, once, again, to, war, in, 1805, the, war, of, the, third, coalition, in, which, austria, britain, russia, and, sweden, took, on, napoleon, the, austrian, forces, began, the, war, by, invading, bavaria, a, key, french, ally, in, germany, but, were, soon, outmaneuvered, and, forced, to, surrender, by, napoleon, at, ulm, before, the, main, austro, russian, force, was, defeated, at, austerlitz, on, 2, december, napoleon, entered, vienna, itself, as, much, a, celebrity, as, conqueror, by, the, treaty, of, pressburg, austria, was, forced, to, give, up, large, amounts, of, territory, dalmatia, to, france, venetia, to, napoleon, s, kingdom, of, italy, the, tyrol, to, bavaria, and, austria, s, various, swabian, territories, to, baden, and, w, rttemberg, although, salzburg, formerly, held, by, francis, s, younger, brother, the, previous, grand, duke, of, tuscany, was, annexed, by, austria, as, compensation, the, defeat, meant, the, end, of, the, old, holy, roman, empire, napoleon, s, satellite, states, in, southern, and, western, germany, seceded, from, the, empire, in, the, summer, of, 1806, forming, the, confederation, of, the, rhine, and, a, few, days, later, francis, proclaimed, the, empire, dissolved, and, renounced, the, old, imperial, crown, on, 6, august, 1806, over, the, next, three, years, austria, whose, foreign, policy, was, now, directed, by, philipp, stadion, attempted, to, maintain, peace, with, france, avoiding, the, war, of, the, fourth, coalition, 1806, 1807, but, obliged, to, do, france, s, bidding, the, overthrow, of, the, spanish, bourbons, in, 1808, was, deeply, disturbing, to, the, habsburgs, who, rather, desperately, went, to, war, once, again, in, 1809, the, war, of, the, fifth, coalition, this, time, with, no, continental, allies, but, the, united, kingdom, stadion, s, attempts, to, generate, popular, uprisings, in, germany, were, unsuccessful, and, the, russians, honoured, their, alliance, with, france, so, austria, was, once, again, defeated, at, the, battle, of, wagram, although, at, greater, cost, than, napoleon, who, had, suffered, his, first, battlefield, defeat, in, this, war, at, aspern, essling, had, expected, however, napoleon, had, already, re, occupied, vienna, the, terms, of, the, subsequent, treaty, of, sch, nbrunn, were, quite, harsh, austria, lost, salzburg, to, bavaria, some, of, its, polish, lands, to, russia, and, its, remaining, territory, on, the, adriatic, including, much, of, carinthia, and, styria, to, napoleon, s, illyrian, provinces, austria, became, a, virtual, subject, state, of, france, klemens, von, metternich, the, new, austrian, foreign, minister, aimed, to, pursue, a, pro, french, policy, francis, ii, s, daughter, marie, louise, was, married, to, napoleon, in, 1810, austria, was, effectively, bankrupt, by, 1811, and, the, paper, money, lost, considerable, value, but, contributed, an, army, to, napoleon, s, invasion, of, russia, in, march, 1812, with, napoleon, s, disastrous, defeat, in, russia, at, the, end, of, the, year, and, prussia, s, defection, to, the, russian, side, in, march, 1813, metternich, began, slowly, to, shift, his, policy, initially, he, aimed, to, mediate, a, peace, between, france, and, its, continental, enemies, but, when, it, became, apparent, that, napoleon, was, not, interested, in, compromise, austria, joined, the, allies, and, declared, war, on, france, in, august, 1813, in, the, war, of, the, sixth, coalition, 1812, 1814, the, austrian, intervention, was, decisive, napoleon, was, defeated, at, leipzig, in, october, and, forced, to, withdraw, into, france, itself, as, 1814, began, the, allied, forces, invaded, france, initially, metternich, remained, unsure, as, to, whether, he, wanted, napoleon, to, remain, on, the, throne, a, marie, louise, regency, for, napoleon, s, young, son, or, a, bourbon, restoration, but, he, was, eventually, brought, around, by, british, foreign, secretary, lord, castlereagh, to, the, last, position, napoleon, abdicated, on, 3, april, 1814, and, louis, xviii, was, restored, soon, negotiating, a, peace, treaty, with, the, victorious, allies, at, paris, in, june, while, napoleon, was, exiled, to, elba, napoleon, escaped, in, february, 1815, louis, fled, and, thus, the, final, phase, of, the, war, the, war, of, the, seventh, coalition, ensued, the, so, called, hundred, days, of, napoleon, s, attempt, at, restoration, this, culminated, with, the, decisive, battle, of, waterloo, in, june, the, napoleonic, wars, ended, with, the, second, treaty, of, paris, that, year, and, napoleon, s, final, exile, to, st, helena, with, the, completion, of, the, long, running, french, wars, a, new, order, was, required, in, europe, and, the, heads, of, the, european, states, gathered, in, vienna, for, a, prolonged, discussion, of, europe, s, future, although, the, congress, was, actually, convened, in, september, 1814, prior, to, napoleon, s, attempted, return, and, completed, on, 9, june, 1815, nine, days, before, the, battle, of, waterloo, at, the, completion, of, the, napoleonic, wars, austria, found, itself, on, the, winning, side, as, a, new, european, leader, largely, due, to, metternich, s, diplomatic, skills, it, was, as, much, a, grand, social, event, of, the, representatives, of, the, great, powers, as, a, true, congress, and, was, chaired, by, metternich, its, purpose, was, to, restore, a, new, european, order, to, emerge, from, the, chaos, of, the, napoleonic, wars, while, austria, was, the, diplomatic, leader, the, military, victory, was, largely, that, of, russia, and, prussia, aided, by, britain, and, spain, and, austria, had, little, to, add, to, the, final, defeat, of, napoleon, on, 18, june, 1815, at, waterloo, metternich, s, intent, was, to, create, a, balance, of, power, in, europe, under, a, new, entity, the, german, confederation, with, austrian, leadership, out, of, the, ashes, of, the, holy, roman, empire, the, resulting, order, was, referred, to, as, the, concert, of, europe, which, would, now, meet, regularly, to, resolve, outstanding, differences, in, addition, to, redrawing, the, political, map, it, established, spheres, of, influence, achieving, the, presidency, of, this, new, entity, was, austria, s, greatest, gain, from, the, congress, what, the, congress, could, not, do, was, to, recover, the, old, order, or, ancien, r, gime, on, which, austrian, and, habsburg, authority, had, rested, in, the, new, order, a, holy, alliance, was, created, between, austria, russia, and, prussia, this, was, subsequently, enlarged, to, include, most, european, nations, notable, exceptions, were, great, britain, wary, of, metternich, s, strategy, of, repressive, interventionism, and, the, ottoman, empire, in, the, redrawing, of, the, european, map, austrian, gains, were, modest, compared, to, russia, and, prussia, reflecting, its, relatively, weak, negotiating, position, austria, regained, most, of, the, territory, it, had, lost, to, napoleon, in, the, western, part, of, the, nation, tyrol, salzburg, and, voralberg, in, italy, it, gained, the, kingdom, of, lombardy, venetia, tuscany, modena, parma, and, piacenza, these, latter, political, entities, were, ruled, by, various, branches, of, the, habsburgs, it, did, not, however, regain, belgium, and, the, austrian, netherlands, but, the, trading, of, territories, restored, a, contiguous, territory, as, envisaged, by, joseph, ii, and, gave, austria, control, over, italy, the, emperor, francis, was, unwilling, to, adapt, to, this, new, order, requiring, diplomacy, on, metternich, s, part, depicting, it, as, conservative, romanticism, religion, and, order, versus, the, revolutionary, spirit, of, 1789, thus, the, holy, alliance, became, a, mechanism, for, countering, any, moves, against, legitimate, order, metternich, has, therefore, been, portrayed, europe, s, fireman, extinguishing, any, signs, of, revolutionary, spirit, the, resultant, onset, of, peace, provided, the, opportunity, for, both, reforms, and, prosperity, in, austria, but, its, backward, looking, policies, within, a, europe, characterised, by, rapid, change, set, the, scene, for, eventual, failure, napoleonic, vienna, was, the, vienna, of, beethoven, whose, single, opera, fidelio, was, premiered, there, in, 1805, attended, by, the, french, military, it, was, also, the, era, of, the, third, eroica, 1805, with, its, ambivalent, relation, to, napoleon, and, the, fifth, schicksals, and, the, sixth, pastorale, symphonies, 1808, the, period, following, the, congress, of, vienna, was, one, of, relative, political, stability, and, is, better, known, for, its, culture, biedermeier, other, names, for, the, years, 1815, 1848, include, vorm, rz, before, march, referring, to, period, before, the, revolution, of, march, 1848, and, the, age, of, metternich, referring, to, his, dominant, position, in, european, politics, under, the, control, of, metternich, who, became, chancellor, in, 1821, the, austrian, empire, entered, a, period, of, censorship, and, a, police, state, with, surveillance, spying, and, imprisonment, of, the, opposition, while, others, emigrated, for, europe, it, was, a, period, characterised, by, increasing, industrialisation, the, social, consequences, of, economic, cycles, population, mobility, and, nationalism, all, of, these, were, regarded, warily, by, governments, intent, on, preserving, the, existing, order, in, 1823, the, emperor, of, austria, made, the, five, rothschild, brothers, barons, nathan, mayer, rothschild, in, london, chose, not, to, take, up, the, title, the, family, became, famous, as, bankers, in, the, major, countries, of, europe, the, congress, of, vienna, was, followed, by, a, series, of, other, congresses, referred, to, as, the, congress, system, including, the, congresses, of, aix, la, chapelle, 1818, troppau, 1820, laibach, 1821, and, verona, 1822, these, largely, served, to, further, suppress, change, though, a, notable, exception, was, the, reintegration, of, france, at, the, first, of, these, resulting, in, the, quintuple, alliance, of, the, five, great, powers, britain, austria, prussia, russia, and, then, france, within, the, quintuple, alliance, the, more, conservative, holy, alliance, of, russia, austria, and, prussia, tended, to, dominate, the, discourse, the, congress, system, of, dispute, resolution, did, not, survive, the, 1820s, and, in, particular, the, intervention, in, the, war, of, greek, independence, 1821, 1832, over, metternich, s, objections, revealed, the, limits, of, his, power, further, cracks, in, the, old, order, appeared, as, south, america, broke, away, from, spain, and, portugal, a, liberal, regime, appeared, in, portugal, and, french, revolution, and, the, independence, of, belgium, in, 1830, throughout, there, had, been, a, division, within, the, quintuple, alliance, between, the, more, liberal, western, nations, of, britain, and, france, and, the, more, conservative, holy, alliance, in, the, east, the, london, conference, of, 1830, to, decide, on, belgian, independence, from, the, netherlands, effectively, led, to, britain, s, withdrawal, from, the, alliance, 1840, saw, a, number, of, related, events, that, reflected, on, the, unity, of, the, great, powers, austria, relied, on, russia, over, the, eastern, question, and, the, oriental, crisis, of, that, year, split, those, powers, at, least, temporarily, while, in, the, west, the, rhine, crisis, between, france, and, the, german, confederation, further, fuelled, the, nascent, german, nationalism, movement, typified, by, die, wacht, am, rhein, closer, to, home, metternich, exerted, his, influence, in, suppressing, german, nationalism, the, wartburg, festival, of, 1817, with, its, calls, for, german, unity, and, condemnation, of, conservatism, created, alarm, metternich, prevented, austrian, universities, participating, and, further, activism, in, 1819, with, the, assassination, of, august, von, kotzebue, in, 1819, resulted, in, the, carlsbad, decrees, of, that, year, suppressing, free, speech, and, the, vienna, final, act, of, 1820, empowering, the, german, confederation, to, act, against, member, states, neither, fully, succeeded, in, delaying, the, nationalist, movement, for, long, early, efforts, among, the, italians, to, create, a, unified, nation, including, the, carbonari, in, lombardy, venetia, were, put, down, by, metternich, with, military, intervention, similarly, in, poland, meanwhile, the, minority, populations, within, the, empire, such, as, the, slavs, and, poles, were, seeking, national, identities, distinct, from, austria, metternich, sought, to, deflect, these, movements, into, cultural, identity, similarly, in, germany, a, prussian, led, german, customs, union, of, the, german, states, was, formed, in, 1833, but, austria, did, not, join, identifying, within, it, german, nationalism, one, of, the, few, administrative, reforms, was, the, granting, of, a, diet, to, galicia, metternich, kept, a, firm, hand, on, government, resisting, the, constitutional, freedoms, demanded, by, the, liberals, government, was, by, custom, and, by, imperial, decree, he, was, both, an, oppressive, reactionary, opportunist, but, also, a, true, conservative, politician, his, role, in, directing, european, affairs, gave, the, habsburgs, a, disproportionate, influence, relative, to, their, actual, powers, the, extensive, security, mechanism, was, headed, by, count, joseph, sedlnitzky, under, metternich, s, personal, supervision, while, religion, was, seen, merely, as, a, tool, for, supporting, authority, state, intervention, in, fiscal, matters, was, relatively, restrained, although, the, national, bank, of, austria, was, established, in, 1816, to, restore, the, nation, s, credit, status, taxation, was, largely, left, to, the, provinces, and, uneven, within, the, empire, hungary, paying, disproportionally, less, the, aristocrats, were, also, undertaxed, one, of, the, results, was, that, the, military, budget, was, relatively, small, and, thus, unable, to, give, much, force, to, metternich, s, foreign, policies, economic, growth, was, relatively, small, and, did, not, keep, pace, with, population, growth, industrialisation, in, austria, began, around, 1830, primarily, in, vienna, and, voralberg, 1838, saw, the, first, railway, connecting, vienna, and, deutsch, wagram, a, distance, of, about, 15, km, and, construction, on, the, austrian, southern, railway, sterreichische, s, dbahn, started, the, following, year, in, shipping, the, danube, steam, navigation, company, was, established, in, 1829, while, austrian, lloyd, became, the, largest, shipping, company, in, the, mediterranean, these, economic, developments, came, at, a, cost, as, large, numbers, of, farm, workers, migrated, to, the, growing, urban, industries, to, form, an, expanding, proletariat, francis, firmly, resisted, metternich, s, proposals, for, overhauling, the, monarchy, when, francis, died, in, 1835, his, son, ferdinand, i, 1835, 1848, ferdinand, the, benign, succeeded, him, but, proved, unfit, to, govern, due, to, illness, with, much, of, the, decision, making, falling, to, his, uncle, archduke, louis, of, austria, and, metternich, consequently, austria, entered, a, period, of, political, stagnation, with, francis, being, unwilling, to, make, reforms, and, ferdinand, being, incapable, of, so, doing, and, metternich, committed, to, preserving, the, status, quo, during, this, period, both, liberalism, and, nationalism, were, on, the, rise, which, resulted, in, the, revolutions, of, 1848, metternich, and, the, mentally, handicapped, emperor, ferdinand, i, were, forced, to, resign, to, be, replaced, by, the, emperor, s, young, nephew, franz, joseph, separatist, tendencies, especially, in, lombardy, and, hungary, were, suppressed, by, military, force, a, constitution, was, enacted, in, march, 1848, but, it, had, little, practical, impact, although, elections, were, held, in, june, the, 1850s, saw, a, return, to, neoabsolutism, and, abrogation, of, constitutionalism, however, one, of, the, concessions, to, revolutionaries, with, a, lasting, impact, was, the, freeing, of, peasants, in, austria, this, facilitated, industrialization, as, many, flocked, to, the, newly, industrializing, cities, of, the, austrian, domain, in, the, industrial, centers, of, bohemia, lower, austria, vienna, and, upper, styria, social, upheaval, led, to, increased, strife, in, ethnically, mixed, cities, leading, to, mass, nationalist, movements, on, the, foreign, policy, front, austria, with, its, non, german, constituencies, was, faced, with, a, dilemma, in, 1848, when, germany, s, constituent, national, assembly, of, which, austria, was, a, member, stated, that, members, could, not, have, a, state, connection, with, non, german, states, leaving, austria, to, decide, between, germany, or, its, empire, and, hungarian, union, however, these, plans, came, to, nothing, for, the, time, being, but, the, concept, of, a, smaller, germany, that, excluded, austria, was, to, re, emerge, as, the, solution, in, 1866, austria, s, neutrality, during, the, crimean, war, 1853, 1856, while, the, emperor, was, preoccupied, with, his, wedding, antagonized, both, sides, and, left, austria, dangerously, isolated, as, subsequent, events, proved, while, austria, and, the, habsburgs, held, hegemony, over, northern, italy, the, south, was, the, kingdom, of, the, two, sicilies, with, the, papal, states, intervening, italy, had, been, in, a, turmoil, since, the, congress, of, vienna, in, 1815, with, insurrections, starting, in, 1820, king, ferdinand, ii, of, the, two, sicilies, an, absolutist, monarch, sought, to, strengthen, his, position, by, a, further, dynastic, alliance, with, austria, he, already, had, a, connection, through, his, second, wife, maria, theresa, granddaughter, of, the, emperor, leopold, ii, this, he, achieved, by, marrying, his, son, francis, ii, to, duchess, maria, sophie, of, bavaria, in, february, 1859, marie, was, a, younger, sister, of, the, empress, elisabeth, of, austria, making, francis, brother, in, law, to, the, emperor, ferdinand, died, a, few, months, later, in, may, and, francis, and, maria, sophie, ascended, the, throne, in, the, meantime, austria, had, fallen, into, a, trap, set, by, the, italian, risorgimento, piedmont, jointly, ruled, with, sardinia, had, been, the, site, of, earlier, insurrections, this, time, they, formed, a, secret, alliance, with, france, patto, di, plombi, res, whose, emperor, napoleon, iii, was, a, previous, carbonari, piedmont, then, proceeded, to, provoke, vienna, with, a, series, of, military, manoeuvres, successfully, triggering, an, ultimatum, to, turin, on, 23, april, its, rejection, was, followed, by, an, austrian, invasion, and, precipitated, war, with, france, second, italian, war, of, independence, 1859, austria, mistakenly, expected, support, and, received, none, and, the, country, was, ill, prepared, for, war, which, went, badly, the, habsburg, rulers, in, tuscany, and, modena, were, forced, to, flee, to, vienna, in, may, 1859, austria, suffered, a, military, defeat, at, the, battle, of, varese, and, in, june, at, magenta, against, the, combined, forces, of, france, and, sardinia, the, emperor, refused, to, acknowledge, the, seriousness, of, the, situation, which, was, causing, great, hardship, at, home, and, took, over, direct, command, of, the, army, though, not, a, professional, soldier, later, that, month, a, further, defeat, at, solf, rino, sealed, austria, s, fate, and, the, emperor, found, himself, having, to, accept, napoleon, s, terms, at, villafranca, austria, agreed, to, cede, lombardy, and, the, rulers, of, the, central, italian, states, were, to, be, restored, however, the, latter, never, happened, and, the, following, year, in, plebiscites, all, joined, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, piedmont, by, april, 1860, garibaldi, had, invaded, and, quickly, subdued, sicily, and, by, february, 1861, the, kingdom, of, the, two, sicilies, ceased, to, exist, francis, and, maria, fled, to, austria, these, events, severely, weakened, the, emperor, s, position, the, government, s, absolutist, policies, were, unpopular, and, these, setbacks, led, to, domestic, unrest, hungarian, secessionism, criticism, of, austria, s, governance, and, allegations, of, corruption, the, first, casualties, were, the, emperor, s, ministers, the, finance, minister, karl, ludwig, von, bruck, killed, himself, other, casualties, were, count, karl, ferdinand, von, buol, foreign, minister, interior, minister, baron, alexander, von, bach, police, minister, johann, freiherr, von, kempen, von, fichtenstamm, adjutant, general, karl, ludwig, von, gr, nne, together, with, army, generals, the, result, was, a, reluctant, undertaking, by, the, emperor, and, his, chief, advisor, goluchowski, to, return, to, constitutional, government, culminating, in, the, october, diploma, october, 1860, establishing, constitutional, monarchy, through, a, legislative, assembly, and, provincial, autonomy, this, was, never, completely, implemented, due, to, hungarian, resistance, demanding, the, full, autonomy, lost, in, 1849, consequently, the, october, diploma, was, replaced, by, the, february, patent, in, 1861, establishing, a, bicameral, legislative, body, the, reichsrat, the, upper, house, consisted, of, appointed, and, hereditary, positions, while, the, lower, house, the, house, of, deputies, was, appointed, by, the, provincial, diets, the, reichsrat, would, meet, with, or, without, the, hungarians, depending, on, the, issues, being, considered, this, was, a, first, step, towards, the, establishment, of, a, separate, cisleithanian, legislature, on, the, other, hand, the, more, limited, role, of, the, diets, in, the, february, patent, compared, to, the, october, diploma, angered, the, champions, of, regionalism, the, reichsrat, was, dominated, by, liberals, who, were, to, be, the, dominant, political, force, for, the, next, two, decades, prussia, and, denmark, had, already, fought, one, war, in, 1848, 1851, over, the, territories, that, lined, their, common, border, schleswig, holstein, which, resulted, in, denmark, retaining, them, by, 1864, austria, was, at, war, again, this, time, allying, itself, with, prussia, against, denmark, in, the, second, schleswig, war, which, although, successful, this, time, turned, out, to, be, austria, s, last, military, victory, the, war, concluded, with, the, treaty, of, vienna, by, which, denmark, ceded, the, territories, the, following, year, the, gastein, convention, resolved, the, control, of, the, new, territories, holstein, being, allocated, to, austria, after, initial, conflicts, between, the, allies, however, this, did, little, to, ease, the, austria, prussia, rivalry, over, the, german, question, the, ongoing, efforts, by, otto, von, bismarck, the, prussian, minister, president, to, revoke, the, agreement, and, wrest, control, of, the, territories, would, soon, lead, to, all, out, conflict, between, the, two, powers, and, achieve, the, desired, weakening, of, austria, s, position, in, central, europe, from, the, 1848, revolution, in, which, much, of, the, hungarian, aristocracy, had, participated, hungary, remained, restless, restoration, of, the, constitution, and, de, throne, the, house, of, habsburg, opposing, the, centralist, trials, of, vienna, and, refusing, to, pay, taxes, hungary, had, little, support, in, the, court, at, vienna, which, was, strongly, bohemian, and, considered, the, hungarians, as, revolutionaries, from, the, loss, of, the, italian, territories, in, 1859, the, hungarian, question, became, more, prominent, hungary, was, negotiating, with, foreign, powers, to, support, it, and, most, significantly, with, prussia, therefore, hungary, represented, a, threat, to, austria, in, any, opposition, to, prussia, within, the, german, confederation, over, the, german, question, therefore, cautious, discussions, over, concessions, referred, to, as, conciliation, by, the, hungarians, started, to, take, place, emperor, franz, joseph, traveled, to, budapest, in, june, 1865, and, made, a, few, concessions, such, as, abolishing, the, military, jurisdiction, and, granting, an, amnesty, to, the, press, however, these, fell, far, short, of, the, demands, of, the, hungarian, liberals, whose, minimal, demands, were, restoration, of, the, constitution, and, the, emperor, s, separate, coronation, as, king, of, hungary, chief, among, these, were, gyula, andr, ssy, and, ferenc, de, k, who, endeavoured, to, improve, their, influence, at, the, court, in, vienna, in, january, 1866, a, delegation, of, the, hungarian, parliament, traveled, to, vienna, to, invite, the, imperial, family, to, make, an, official, visit, to, hungary, which, they, did, at, some, length, from, january, to, march, while, andr, ssy, was, making, frequent, visits, to, vienna, from, budapest, during, early, 1866, relations, with, prussia, were, deteriorating, there, was, talk, of, war, prussia, had, signed, a, secret, treaty, with, the, relatively, new, kingdom, of, italy, on, 8, april, while, austria, concluded, one, with, france, on, 12, june, in, exchange, for, venetia, while, the, motives, for, the, war, prussian, masterplan, or, opportunism, are, disputed, the, outcome, was, a, radical, re, alignment, of, power, in, central, europe, austria, brought, the, continuing, dispute, over, holstein, before, the, german, diet, and, also, decided, to, convene, the, holstein, diet, prussia, declaring, that, the, gastein, convention, had, thereby, been, nullified, invaded, holstein, when, the, german, diet, responded, by, voting, for, a, partial, mobilization, against, prussia, bismarck, declared, that, the, german, confederation, was, ended, thus, this, may, be, considered, a, third, schleswig, war, hostilities, broke, out, on, 14, june, as, the, austro, prussian, war, june, august, 1866, in, which, prussia, and, the, north, german, states, faced, not, only, austria, but, much, of, the, rest, of, germany, especially, the, southern, states, three, days, later, italy, declared, war, on, austria, in, the, third, italian, war, of, independence, italy, now, being, prussia, s, ally, thus, austria, had, to, fight, on, two, fronts, their, first, engagement, resulted, in, a, minor, victory, against, the, italians, at, custoza, near, verona, on, 24, june, however, on, the, northern, front, austria, suffered, a, major, military, defeat, at, the, battle, of, k, niggr, tz, in, bohemia, on, 3, july, although, austria, had, a, further, victory, against, the, italians, in, a, naval, battle, at, lissa, on, 20, july, it, was, clear, by, then, that, the, war, was, over, for, austria, prussian, armies, threatening, vienna, itself, forcing, the, evacuation, of, the, court, to, budapest, napoleon, iii, intervened, resulting, in, an, armistice, at, nikolsburg, on, 21, july, and, a, peace, treaty, in, prague, on, 23, august, in, the, meantime, the, italians, who, had, had, a, series, of, successes, throughout, july, and, signed, an, armistice, at, cormons, on, 12, august, rather, than, face, the, remaining, austrian, army, freed, from, its, northern, front, as, a, result, of, these, wars, austria, had, now, lost, all, its, italian, territory, and, was, now, excluded, from, further, german, affairs, that, were, now, reorganised, under, prussian, dominance, in, the, new, north, german, confederation, the, kleindeutschland, concept, had, prevailed, for, the, austrians, in, italy, the, war, had, been, tragically, pointless, since, venetia, had, already, been, ceded, while, austria, was, reeling, from, the, effects, of, war, the, hungarians, increased, the, pressure, for, their, demands, andr, ssy, was, regularly, in, vienna, as, was, ferenc, de, k, and, the, hungarian, position, was, backed, by, constitutionalists, and, liberals, while, anti, hungarian, sentiments, ran, high, at, the, court, the, emperor, s, position, was, becoming, increasingly, untenable, with, the, prussian, army, now, at, pressburg, now, bratislava, and, vienna, crammed, with, exiles, while, hope, for, french, intervention, proved, to, be, fruitless, the, hungarians, recruited, empress, elisabeth, who, became, a, strong, advocate, for, their, cause, gy, rgy, klapka, had, organised, a, legion, fighting, for, the, prussians, which, bismarck, had, supported, that, entered, hungary, and, agitated, for, hungarian, independence, however, the, needs, of, the, other, provinces, had, to, be, considered, before, entering, into, any, form, of, hungarian, dualism, which, would, give, hungary, special, privileges, and, started, to, fan, the, flames, of, czech, nationalism, since, slavic, interests, were, likely, to, be, submerged, people, started, to, talk, about, the, events, of, 1848, again, by, february, 1867, count, belcredi, resigned, as, minister, president, over, his, concerns, about, slavic, interests, and, was, succeeded, by, foreign, minister, ferdinand, beust, who, promptly, pursued, the, hungarian, option, which, had, become, a, reality, by, the, end, of, the, month, austria, hungary, was, created, through, the, mechanism, of, the, austro, hungarian, compromise, of, 1867, thus, the, hungarians, finally, achieved, much, of, their, aims, the, western, half, of, the, realm, known, as, cisleithania, and, the, eastern, hungarian, transleithania, that, is, the, realms, lying, on, each, side, of, the, leitha, tributary, of, the, danube, river, now, became, two, realms, with, different, interior, policy, there, was, no, common, citizenship, and, dual, citizenship, was, banned, either, but, with, a, common, ruler, and, a, common, foreign, and, military, policy, the, empire, now, had, two, capitals, two, cabinets, and, two, parliaments, only, three, cabinet, positions, served, both, halves, of, the, monarchy, war, foreign, affairs, and, finance, when, both, sectors, were, involved, costs, were, assigned, 70, 30, to, cisleithania, however, the, hungarians, represented, a, single, nationality, while, cisleithania, included, all, the, other, kingdoms, and, provinces, andr, ssy, was, appointed, as, the, first, minister, president, of, the, new, hungary, on, 17, february, feelings, ran, high, in, the, provinces, and, the, diets, in, moravia, and, bohemia, were, shut, down, in, march, emperor, franz, joseph, made, a, speech, from, the, throne, in, may, to, the, reichsrat, imperial, council, asking, for, retroactive, ratification, and, promising, further, constitutional, reforms, and, increased, autonomy, to, the, provinces, this, was, a, major, retreat, from, absolutism, on, 8, june, the, emperor, and, empress, were, crowned, king, and, queen, of, hungary, in, a, ceremony, whose, pomp, and, splendour, seemed, out, of, keeping, with, austria, s, recent, military, and, political, humiliation, and, the, extent, of, financial, reparations, as, part, of, the, celebrations, the, emperor, announced, further, concessions, that, aggravated, relationships, between, hungary, and, the, rest, of, the, monarchy, an, amnesty, was, declared, for, all, political, offences, since, 1848, including, klapka, and, kossuth, and, reversal, of, the, confiscation, of, estates, in, addition, the, coronation, gift, was, directed, to, the, families, and, veterans, of, the, revolutionary, honv, d, s, which, was, revived, as, the, royal, hungarian, honv, d, in, return, for, the, liberals, support, of, the, ausgleich, concessions, were, made, to, parliamentary, prerogatives, in, the, new, constitutional, law, the, law, of, 21, december, 1867, although, frequently, amended, was, the, foundation, of, austrian, governance, for, the, remaining, 50, years, of, the, empire, and, was, largely, based, on, the, february, patent, the, imperial, council, and, included, a, bill, of, rights, ultimately, the, political, balance, of, the, dual, monarchy, represented, a, compromise, between, authoritarianism, and, parliamentarianism, rechtsstaat, hacohen, 2002, like, most, compromises, it, was, rejected, by, extremists, on, both, sides, including, kossuth, 1873, marked, the, silver, jubilee, of, franz, joseph, and, provided, not, only, an, occasion, for, celebration, but, also, one, of, reflection, on, the, progress, of, the, monarchy, since, 1848, vienna, had, grown, from, a, population, of, 500, 000, to, over, a, million, the, walls, and, fortifications, had, been, demolished, and, the, ringstrasse, constructed, with, many, magnificent, new, buildings, along, it, the, danube, was, being, regulated, to, reduce, the, risk, of, flooding, a, new, aqueduct, constructed, to, bring, fresh, water, into, the, city, and, many, new, bridges, schools, hospitals, churches, and, a, new, university, built, foreign, policy, what, was, supposed, to, be, a, temporary, emergency, measure, was, to, last, for, half, a, century, austria, succeeded, in, staying, neutral, during, the, franco, prussian, war, of, 1870, 71, despite, those, who, saw, an, opportunity, for, revenge, on, prussia, for, the, events, of, 1866, however, austria, s, allies, among, the, south, german, states, were, now, allied, with, prussia, and, it, was, unlikely, that, austria, s, military, capacity, had, significantly, improved, in, the, meantime, any, residual, doubts, were, rapidly, dispelled, by, the, speed, of, the, prussian, advance, and, the, subsequent, overthrow, of, the, second, empire, in, november, 1871, austria, made, a, radical, change, in, foreign, policy, ferdinand, beust, the, first, prime, minister, to, 1867, chancellor, and, foreign, minister, 1866, 1871, of, the, dual, monarchy, was, dismissed, beust, was, an, advocate, of, revanche, against, prussia, but, was, succeeded, by, the, hungarian, prime, minister, the, liberal, gyula, andr, ssy, as, foreign, minister, 1871, 1879, although, both, opposed, the, federalist, policies, of, prime, minister, karl, hohenwart, 1871, while, prince, adolf, of, auersperg, became, the, new, prime, minister, 1871, 1879, andr, ssy, s, appointment, caused, concern, among, the, conservative, court, party, but, he, worked, hard, to, restore, relationships, between, berlin, and, vienna, culminating, in, the, dual, alliance, of, 1879, in, 1878, austria, hungary, occupied, bosnia, and, herzegovina, which, had, been, cut, off, from, the, rest, of, the, ottoman, empire, by, the, creation, of, new, states, in, the, balkans, following, the, russo, turkish, war, of, 1877, 78, and, the, resulting, congress, of, berlin, june, july, 1878, the, territory, was, ceded, to, austria, hungary, and, andr, ssy, prepared, to, occupy, it, this, led, to, a, further, deterioration, of, relations, with, russia, and, was, to, lead, to, tragic, consequences, in, the, next, century, austrian, troops, encountered, stiff, resistance, and, suffered, significant, casualties, the, occupation, created, controversy, both, within, and, without, the, empire, and, led, to, andr, ssy, s, resignation, in, 1879, this, territory, was, finally, annexed, in, 1908, and, put, under, joint, rule, by, the, governments, of, both, austria, and, hungary, the, departure, of, the, liberal, government, and, of, andr, ssy, from, the, foreign, office, k, u, k, ministerium, des, u, ern, marked, a, sharp, shift, in, austria, hungary, s, foreign, policy, particularly, in, relation, to, russia, count, gustav, k, lnoky, 1881, 1895, andr, ssy, s, conservative, replacement, pursuing, a, new, rapprochement, economy, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, saw, a, lot, of, construction, expansion, of, cities, and, railway, lines, and, development, of, industry, during, the, earlier, part, of, this, period, known, as, gr, nderzeit, austria, became, an, industrialized, country, even, though, the, alpine, regions, remained, characterized, by, agriculture, austria, was, able, to, celebrate, its, newfound, grandeur, in, the, vienna, world, exhibition, of, 1873, attended, by, all, the, crowned, heads, of, europe, and, beyond, this, period, of, relative, prosperity, was, followed, by, the, 1873, stock, market, crash, political, parties, became, legitimate, entities, in, austria, from, 1848, apart, from, a, brief, lapse, in, the, 1850s, however, the, structure, of, the, legislative, body, created, by, the, 1861, february, patent, provided, little, scope, for, party, organisation, initial, political, organisation, resembled, the, cleavages, in, austrian, culture, since, the, time, of, the, counter, reformation, the, catholic, church, had, assumed, a, major, role, in, the, political, life, of, the, empire, in, conjunction, with, the, aristocracy, and, conservative, rural, elements, allied, against, these, forces, were, a, more, secular, urban, middle, class, reflecting, the, enlightenment, and, the, french, revolution, with, its, anti, clericism, kulturkampf, other, elements, on, the, left, were, german, nationalism, defending, greater, german, interests, against, the, slavs, and, found, support, among, urban, intelligentsia, however, party, structure, was, far, from, cohesive, and, both, groupings, contained, factions, which, either, supported, or, opposed, the, government, of, the, day, these, parties, reflected, the, traditional, right, left, split, of, political, vision, the, left, or, liberal, factions, were, known, as, the, constitutional, party, but, both, left, and, right, were, fragmented, into, factions, without, direct, elections, there, was, no, place, for, constituency, organisation, and, affinities, were, intellectual, not, organisational, nor, without, ministerial, responsibility, was, there, a, need, for, such, organisation, the, affinities, were, driven, by, respective, visions, of, the, representative, institutions, the, left, derived, its, name, from, its, support, in, principle, of, the, 1861, 1867, constitution, and, were, the, driving, elements, of, the, 1848, revolution, the, right, supported, historic, rights, the, left, drew, its, support, from, the, propertied, bourgeoisie, besitzb, rgertum, affluent, professionals, and, the, civil, service, these, were, longstanding, ideological, differences, the, 1867, elections, saw, the, liberals, take, control, of, the, lower, house, under, karl, auersperg, 1867, 1868, and, were, instrumental, in, the, adoption, of, the, 1867, constitution, and, in, abrogating, the, 1855, concordat, 1870, suffrage, progressively, improved, during, the, period, 1860, 1882, the, selection, of, deputies, to, the, reichsrat, by, provincial, legislatures, proved, unworkable, particularly, once, the, bohemian, diet, effectively, boycotted, the, reichsrat, in, an, attempt, to, acquire, equal, status, with, the, hungarians, in, a, tripartite, monarchy, as, a, result, suffrage, was, changed, to, direct, election, to, the, reichsrat, in, 1873, even, then, by, 1873, only, six, percent, of, the, adult, male, population, were, franchised, hacohen, 2002, the, initial, divisions, into, catholic, liberal, national, radical, and, agrarian, parties, differed, across, ethnic, grounds, further, fragmenting, the, political, culture, however, there, was, now, emerging, the, presence, of, extra, parliamentary, parties, whereas, previously, parties, were, purely, intra, parliamentary, this, provided, an, opportunity, for, the, disenfranchised, to, find, a, voice, these, changes, were, taking, place, against, a, rapidly, changing, backdrop, of, an, austrian, economy, that, was, modernising, and, industrialising, and, economic, crises, such, as, that, of, 1873, and, its, resultant, depression, 1873, 1879, and, the, traditional, parties, were, slow, to, respond, to, the, demands, of, the, populace, by, the, election, of, 1901, the, last, election, under, the, defined, classes,

he, turned, to, the, conservatives, to, form, a, government, under, count, karl, sigmund, von, hohenwart, 1871, hohenwart, was, the, conservative, leader, in, parliament, and, the, emperor, believed, his, more, sympathetic, views, to, slavic, aspirations, and, federalism, would, weaken, the, austro, german, liberals, hohenwart, appointed, albert, sch, ffle, as, his, commerce, minister, and, drew, up, a, policy, known, as, the, fundamental, articles, of, 1871, the, policy, failed, the, emperor, withdrew, his, support, and, the, liberals, regained, power, the, liberal, party, became,

to, those, who, displayed, the, characteristics, of, the, solid, german, b, rger, they, also, opposed, the, extension, of, suffrage, because, restricted, suffrage, favoured, their, electoral, base, hacohen, 2002, in, 1873, the, party, fragmented, with, a, radical, faction, of, the, constitutional, party, forming, the, progressive, club, while, a, right, wing, faction, formed, the, conservative, constitutionalist, landlordism, leaving, a, rump, of, old, liberals, the, result, was, a, proliferation, of, german, liberal, and, german, national, groups, while, liberal, achievements, had, included, economic, modernisation, expanding, secular, education, and, rebuilding, the, fabric, and, culture, of, vienna, while, collaborating, with, the, administration, verwaltung, after, 1873, a, progressive, series, of, schisms, and, mergers, continued, to, weaken, the, party, which, effectively, disappeared, by, 1911, the, liberal, cabinet, of, adolf, auersperg, 1871, 1879, was, dismissed, in, 1879, over, its, opposition, to, foreign, minister, gyula, andr, ssy, s, 1871, 1879, balkan, policy, and, the, occupation, of, bosnia, herzegovina, which, added, more, slavs, and, further, diluted, german, nationalism, and, identity, in, the, ensuing, elections, the, liberals, lost, control, of, parliament, and, went, into, opposition, the, incoming, government, under, count, edward, taaffe, 1879, 1893, basically, consisting, of, a, group, of, factions, farmers, clergy, and, czechs, the, iron, ring, united, in, a, determination, to, keep, the, liberals, out, of, power, andr, ssy, who, had, nothing, in, common, with, taaffe, tended, his, resignation, on, the, grounds, of, poor, health, and, to, his, surprise, it, was, accepted, his, name, was, raised, again, when, the, new, foreign, minister, haymerle, died, in, office, in, 1881, but, taaffe, and, his, coalition, had, no, time, for, a, liberal, foreign, minister, let, alone, a, hungarian, and, freemason, and, he, was, passed, over, in, favour, of, count, gustav, k, lnoky, 1881, 1895, however, the, liberal, opposition, filibustered, leading, the, government, to, seek, electoral, reform, as, a, strategy, to, weaken, their, position, which, was, enacted, in, 1882, despite, this, the, coalition, nominally, conservative, and, committed, to, anti, socialism, passed, a, series, of, social, reforms, over, the, decade, 1880, 1890, following, the, examples, of, germany, and, switzerland, these, were, reforms, which, the, liberals, had, been, unable, to, get, past, a, government, strongly, tied, to, the, concept, of, individual, s, rights, to, self, determination, free, from, government, interference, such, measures, had, the, support, of, both, the, liberals, now, the, united, left, vereinigte, linke, 1881, and, the, german, national, party, deutsche, nationalpartei, 1891, an, offshoot, of, the, german, national, movement, the, electoral, reforms, of, 1882, were, the, most, influential, in, that, it, enfranchised, proportionally, more, germans, social, reform, now, moved, to, become, a, platform, of, conservative, catholics, like, prince, aloys, de, paula, maria, of, liechtenstein, baron, karl, von, vogelsang, and, count, egbert, belcredi, the, era, of, electoral, reform, saw, the, emergence, of, georg, von, schonerer, s, pan, german, league, 1882, appealing, to, an, anti, clerical, middle, class, and, catholic, social, reformers, such, as, l, psenner, and, a, latschka, created, the, christian, social, association, christlich, sozialer, verein, 1887, around, the, same, time, f, piffl, f, stauracz, ae, schoepfer, a, opitz, karl, lueger, and, prince, aloys, liechtenstein, formed, the, united, christians, to, advocate, christian, social, reform, these, two, organisations, merged, in, 1891, under, karl, lueger, to, form, the, christian, social, party, christlichsoziale, partei, cs, however, the, taaffe, government, s, policy, of, ethnic, inclusiveness, fuelled, nationalism, among, the, german, speaking, population, the, liberals, had, maintained, the, strong, centralism, of, the, absolutist, era, with, the, exception, of, galicia, in, 1867, while, the, conservatives, attempted, a, more, federalist, state, that, ultimately, led, to, the, fall, of, the, taaffe, government, in, 1893, including, a, second, attempt, at, bohemian, ausgleich, tripartite, monarchy, in, 1890, on, the, left, the, spread, of, anarchical, ideas, and, oppressive, government, saw, the, emergence, of, a, marxist, social, democratic, party, sozialdemokratische, arbeiterpartei, sterreichs, sdap, in, 1889, which, succeeded, in, winning, seats, in, the, 1897, elections, which, followed, further, extension, of, suffrage, in, 1896, to, include, peasants, and, the, working, classes, establishing, universal, male, suffrage, though, not, equal, the, universal, male, suffrage, introduced, in, 1907, by, minister, president, freiherr, von, beck, changed, the, balance, of, power, formally, tilted, towards, german, austrians, and, revealed, that, they, were, now, a, minority, in, a, predominantly, slavic, empire, in, the, 1900, census, germans, were, 36, of, the, cisleithanian, population, but, the, largest, single, group, but, never, acted, as, a, cohesive, group, nor, did, any, other, national, group, although, they, were, the, dominant, group, in, the, political, life, of, the, monarchy, germans, were, followed, by, czechs, and, slovaks, 23, poles, 17, ruthenians, 13, slovenes, 5, serbo, croats, 3, italians, 3, and, romanians, 1, however, these, national, groups, especially, the, germans, were, often, scattered, geographically, the, germans, also, dominated, economically, and, in, level, of, education, the, post, reform, 1907, parliament, reichsrat, was, elected, along, national, lines, with, only, the, christian, social, and, social, democrat, parties, predominantly, german, however, austria, was, governed, by, the, emperor, who, appointed, the, imperial, council, of, ministers, who, in, turn, answered, to, him, parliament, being, left, free, to, criticise, government, policy, technically, it, had, the, power, to, legislate, from, 1907, but, in, practice, the, imperial, government, generated, its, own, legislation, and, the, emperor, could, veto, his, own, minister, s, bills, the, major, parties, were, divided, geographically, and, socially, with, the, social, democrats, base, being, the, towns, predominantly, vienna, and, having, a, very, different, perspective, to, the, devout, but, illiterate, peasantry, in, the, countryside, the, latter, were, joined, by, the, aristocracy, and, bourgeoisie, in, supporting, the, status, quo, of, the, monarchy, the, 1911, elections, elected, a, parliament, that, would, carry, austria, through, the, war, and, the, end, of, the, empire, in, 1918, however, the, effectiveness, of, parliamentarism, was, hampered, by, conflicts, between, parties, representing, different, ethnic, groups, and, meetings, of, the, parliament, ceased, altogether, during, world, war, i, the, initial, years, of, the, 19th, century, following, the, congress, of, vienna, up, until, the, revolution, of, 1848, was, characterised, by, the, biedermeier, period, of, design, and, architecture, partly, fueled, by, the, repressive, domestic, scene, that, diverted, attention, to, domesticity, and, the, arts, with, the, reign, of, franz, joseph, 1848, 1916, came, a, new, era, of, grandeur, typified, by, the, belle, poque, style, with, extensive, building, and, the, construction, of, the, ringstrasse, in, vienna, with, its, monumental, buildings, officially, opened, 1, may, 1865, after, seven, years, architects, of, the, period, included, heinrich, ferstel, votivkirche, museum, f, r, angewandte, kunst, wien, friedrich, von, schmidt,

president, of, this, group, which, became, known, as, the, vienna, secession, or, wiener, secession, vereinigung, bildender, k, nstler, sterreichs, the, movement, was, a, protest, against, the, historicism, and, conservatism, of, the, former, organisation, following, similar, movements, in, berlin, and, munich, partly, this, was, a, revolt, against, the, perceived, excesses, of, the, earlier, ringstrasse, era, and, a, yearning, to, return, to, the, relative, simplicity, of, biedermaier, from, this, group, josef, hoffman, and, koloman, moser, formed, the, vienna, arts, and, crafts,

irreconcilable, differences, the, group, however, lasted, until, 1939, and, the, outbreak, of, the, second, world, war, architecturally, this, was, the, era, of, jugendstil, art, nouveau, and, the, contrasting, work, of, men, like, otto, wagner, kirche, am, steinhof, known, for, embellishment, and, adolf, loos, who, represented, restraint, art, nouveau, and, the, modern, style, came, relatively, late, to, austria, around, 1900, and, was, distinguishable, from, the, earlier, movement, in, other, european, capitals, one, of, the, prominent, literary, figures, was, karl, kraus, the, essayist, and, satirist, known, for, his, newspaper, the, torch, founded, in, 1899, on, the, musical, scene, johan, strauss, and, his, family, dominated, the, viennese, scene, over, the, entire, period, which, also, produced, franz, schubert, ludwig, van, beethoven, anton, bruckner, johannes, brahms, arnold, schoenberg, franz, leh, r, and, gustav, mahler, among, others, by, the, opening, years, of, the,

emperor, went, into, exile, the, first, world, war, ended, for, austria, on, 3, november, 1918, when, its, defeated, army, signed, the, armistice, of, villa, giusti, at, padua, following, the, battle, of, vittorio, veneto, this, applied, just, to, austria, hungary, but, hungary, had, withdrawn, from, the, conflict, on, 31, october, 1918, austria, was, forced, to, cede, all, territory, occupied, since, 1914, plus, accept, the, formation, of, new, nations, across, most, of, its, pre, war, territory, and, the, allies, were, given, access, to, austria, the, empire, was, thus, dissolved, the,

led, the, first, three, cabinets, 12, november, 1918, 7, july, 1920, as, a, grand, coalition, of, the, largest, parties, although, some, were, composed, of, a, large, number, of, splinter, groups, of, the, german, national, and, german, liberal, movements, and, were, numerically, the, largest, group, in, the, assembly, on, 22, november, austria, claimed, the, german, speaking, territories, of, the, former, habsburg, empire, in, czechoslovakia, german, bohemia, and, parts, of, moravia, poland, austrian, silesia, and, the, south, tyrol, annexed, by, italy, however, austria, was, in, no, position, to, enforce, these, claims, against, either, the, victorious, allies, or, the, new, nation, states, that, emerged, from, the, dissolution, of, the, empire, and, all, the, lands, in, question, remained, separated, from, the, new, austria, french, premier, georges, clemenceau, said, austria, is, what, s, left, an, empire, of, over, 50, million, had, been, reduced, to, a, state, of, 6, 5, million, on, 19, february, elections, were, held, for, what, was, now, called, the, constituent, national, assembly, although, the, social, democrats, won, the, most, seats, 41, they, did, not, have, an, absolute, majority, and, formed, a, grand, coalition, with, the, second, largest, party, the, christian, socialists, on, 12, march, the, national, assembly, declared, german, austria, to, be, part, of, the, german, republic, large, sections, of, the, population, and, most, representatives, of, political, parties, were, of, the, opinion, that, this, residual, or, rump, state, without, hungary, s, agriculture, sector, and, bohemia, s, industry, would, not, be, economically, viable, the, journalist, hellmut, andics, 1922, 1998, expressed, this, sentiment, in, his, book, entitled, der, staat, den, keiner, wollte, the, state, that, nobody, wanted, in, 1962, austria, s, exact, future, remained, uncertain, until, formal, treaties, were, signed, and, ratified, this, process, began, with, the, opening, of, the, peace, conference, in, paris, on, 18, january, 1919, and, culminated, in, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, saint, germain, on, 10, september, that, year, although, the, national, assembly, initially, rejected, the, draft, treaty, on, 7, june, the, fledgling, republic, of, german, austria, was, to, prove, short, lived, the, proposed, merger, with, the, german, empire, weimar, republic, was, vetoed, by, the, allied, victors, in, the, treaty, of, saint, germain, en, laye, 10, september, 1919, under, article, 88, which, prohibited, economic, or, political, union, the, allies, were, fearful, of, the, long, held, mitteleuropa, dream, a, union, of, all, german, speaking, populations, the, treaty, was, ratified, by, parliament, on, 21, october, 1919, austria, was, to, remain, independent, and, was, obliged, to, be, so, for, at, least, 20, years, the, treaty, also, obliged, the, country, to, change, its, name, from, the, republic, of, german, austria, to, the, republic, of, austria, i, e, the, first, republic, a, name, that, persists, to, this, day, the, german, speaking, bordering, areas, of, bohemia, and, moravia, later, called, the, sudetenland, were, allocated, to, the, newly, founded, czechoslovakia, many, austrians, and, germans, regarded, this, as, hypocrisy, since, u, s, president, woodrow, wilson, had, proclaimed, in, his, famous, fourteen, points, the, right, of, self, determination, for, all, nations, in, germany, the, constitution, of, the, weimar, republic, explicitly, stated, this, in, article, 61, deutsch, sterreich, erh, lt, nach,

consulting, role, according, to, its, number, of, inhabitants, until, unification, with, germany, in, austria, itself, almost, all, political, parties, together, with, the, majority, of, public, opinion, continued, to, cling, to, the, concept, of, unification, laid, out, in, article, 2, of, the, 1918, constitution, although, austria, hungary, had, been, one, of, the, central, powers, the, allied, victors, were, much, more, lenient, with, a, defeated, austria, than, with, either, germany, or, hungary, representatives, of, the, new, republic, of, austria, convinced, the, allies, that, it, was, unfair, to, penalize, austria, for, the, actions, of, a, now, dissolved, empire, especially, as, other, areas, of, the, empire, were, now, perceived, to, be, on, the, victor, side, simply, because, they, had, renounced, the, empire, at, the, end, of, the, war, austria, never, did, have, to, pay, reparations, because, allied, commissions, determined, that, the, country, could, not, afford, to, pay, however, the, treaty, of, saint, germain, also, confirmed, austria, s, loss, of, significant, german, speaking, territories, in, particular, the, southern, part, of, the, county, of, tyrol, now, south, tyrol, to, italy, and, the, german, speaking, areas, within, bohemia, and, moravia, to, czechoslovakia, in, compensation, as, it, were, it, was, to, be, awarded, most, of, the, german, speaking, part, of, hungary, in, the, treaty, of, trianon, concluded, between, the, allies, and, that, country, this, was, constituted, the, new, federal, state, of, burgenland, the, grand,

were, held, on, 17, october, for, what, now, became, the, national, council, under, the, new, constitution, of, 1, october, this, resulted, in, the, christian, social, party, now, emerging, as, the, strongest, party, with, 42, of, the, votes, and, subsequently, forming, mayr, s, second, government, on, 22, october, as, a, cs, minority, government, with, the, support, of, the, gdvp, without, the, social, democrats, the, cs, were, to, continue, in, power, until, the, end, of, the, first, republic, in, various, combinations, of, coalitions, with, the, gdvp, and, landbund, founded, 1919, the, borders, continued, to, be, somewhat, uncertain, because, of, plebiscites, in, the, tradition, of, woodrow, wilson, plebiscites, in, the, regions, of, tyrol, and, salzburg, between, 1919, and, 1921,

to, remain, a, part, of, austria, rejecting, the, territorial, claims, of, the, kingdom, of, serbs, croats, and, slovenes, to, the, state, mostly, german, speaking, parts, of, western, hungary, was, awarded, to, austria, as, the, new, province, burgenland, in, 1921, with, the, exception, of, the, city, of, sopron, and, adjacent, territories, whose, population, decided, in, a, referendum, which, is, sometimes, considered, by, austrians, to, have, been, rigged, to, remain, with, hungary, the, area, had, been, discussed, as, the, site, of, a, slavic, corridor, uniting, czechoslovakia, to, yugoslavia, this, made, austria, the, only, defeated, country, to, acquire, additional, territory, as, part, of, border, adjustments, despite, the, absence, of, reparations, austria, under, the,

2, april, referred, to, as, schlacht, auf, dem, exelberg, battle, of, exelberg, involved, 300, nazis, against, 90, socialists, further, episodes, occurred, on, 4, may, and, 30, september, 1923, a,

police, forces, political, conflict, escalated, until, the, early, 1930s, the, elections, of, 1930, which, returned, the, social, democrats, as, the, largest, bloc, turned, out, to, be, the, last, till, after, world, war, ii, on, 20, may, 1932, engelbert, dollfu, christian, social, party, agriculture, minister, became, chancellor, with, a, majority, of, one, dollfuss, and, the, christian, social, party, moved, austria, rapidly, towards, centralized, power, in, the, fascist, model, he, was, concerned, that, german, national, socialist, leader, adolf, hitler, had, become, chancellor, of, germany, on, 30, january, 1933, after, his, party, had, become, the, largest, group, in, the, parliament, and, was, quickly, assuming, absolute, power, similarly, the, austrian, national, socialists, dnsap, could, easily, become, a, significant, minority, in, future, austrian, elections, fascism, scholar, stanley, g, payne, estimated, that, if, elections, had, been, held, in, 1933, the, dnsap, could, have, secured, about, 25, of, the, votes, time, magazine, suggested, an, even, higher, level, of, support, of, 50, with, a, 75, approval, rate, in, the, tyrol, region, bordering, nazi, germany, the, events, in, austria, during, march, 1933, echoed, those, of, germany, where, hitler, also, effectively, installed, himself, as, dictator, in, the, same, month, on, 4, march, 1933, there, occurred, an, irregularity, in, the, parliamentary, voting, procedures, karl, renner, social, democratic, party, of, austria, sozialdemokratische, partei, sterreichs, sp, president, of, the, national, council, nationalrat, lower, house, of, parliament, resigned, in, order, to, be, able, to, cast, a, vote, on, a, controversial, proposal, to, deal, with, the, railroad, strike, that, was, likely, to, pass, by, a, very, small, margin, which, he, was, not, able, to, do, while, holding, that, office, consequently, the, two, vice, presidents, representing, the, other, parties, rudolf, ramek, christian, social, party, and, sepp, straffner, greater, german, people, s, party, also, resigned, for, the, same, reason, in, the, absence, of, the, president, the, session, could, not, be, concluded, although, there, were, procedural, rules, which, could, have, been, followed, in, this, unprecedented, and, unforeseen, event, the, dollfuss, cabinet, seized, the, opportunity, to, declare, the, parliament, unable, to, function, while, dollfuss, described, this, event, as, self, elimination, of, parliament, it, was, actually, the, beginning, of, a, coup, d, etat, that, would, establish, the, st, ndestaat, austrofascism, austrofaschismus, lasting, to, 1938, using, an, emergency, provision, enacted, during, the, first, world, war, the, economic, war, powers, act, kriegswirtschaftliches, erm, chtigungsgesetz, kweg, 24, juli, 1917, rgbl, nr, 307, the, executive, assumed, legislative, power, on, 7, march, and, advised, president, wilhelm, miklas, to, issue, a, decree, adjourning, it, indefinitely, the, first, republic, and, democratic, government, therefore, effectively, ended, in, austria, leaving, dollfuss, to, govern, as, a, dictator, with, absolute, powers, immediate, measures, included, removing, the, right, of, public, assembly, and, freedom, of, the, press, the, opposition, accused, him, of, violating, the, constitution, an, attempt, by, the, greater, german, people, s, party, and, the, social, democrats, to, reconvene, the, council, on, 15, march, was, prevented, by, barring, the, entrance, with, police, and, advising, president, wilhelm, miklas, to, adjourn, it, indefinitely, dollfuss, would, have, been, aware, that, nazi, troops, had, seized, power, in, neighbouring, bavaria, on, 9, march, finally, on, 31, march, the, republikanischer, schutzbund, paramilitary, arm, of, the, social, democratic, party, was, dissolved, but, continued, illegally, dollfuss, then, met, with, benito, mussolini, for, the, first, time, in, rome, on, 13, april, on, 23, april, the, national, socialists, dnsap, gained, 40, per, cent, of, the, vote, in, the, innsbruck, communal, elections, becoming, the, largest, voting, bloc, so, in, may, all, state, and, communal, elections, were, banned, on, 20, may, 1933, dollfuss, replaced, the, democratic, republic, with, a, new, entity, merging, his, christian, social, party, with, elements, of, other, nationalist, and, conservative, groups, including, the, heimwehr, which, encompassed, many, workers, who, were, unhappy, with, the, radical, leadership, of, the, socialist, party, to, form, the, patriotic, front, vaterl, ndische, front, though, the, heimwehr, continued, to, exist, as, an, independent, organization, until, 1936, when, dollfuss, successor, kurt, von, schuschnigg, forcibly, merged, it, into, the, front, instead, creating, the, unabidingly, loyal, frontmiliz, as, a, paramilitary, task, force, the, new, entity, was, allegedly, bipartisan, and, represented, those, who, were, loyal, to, the, government, the, dnsap, was, banned, in, june, 1933, dollfuss, was, also, aware, of, the, soviet, union, s, increasing, influence, in, europe, throughout, the, 1920s, and, early, 1930s, and, also, banned, the, communists, establishing, a, one, party, austrofascist, dictatorship, largely, modeled, after, italian, fascism, tied, to, catholic, corporatism, and, anti, secularism, he, dropped, all, pretence, of, austrian, reunification, with, germany, so, long, as, the, nazi, party, remained, in, power, there, although, all, austrian, parties, including, the, social, democratic, labour, party, sdap, were, banned, social, democrats, continued, to, exist, as, an, independent, organization, including, its, paramilitary, republikaner, schutzbund, which, could, muster, tens, of, thousands, against, dollfuss, government, in, august, 1933, mussolini, s, government, issued, a, guarantee, of, austrian, independence, if, necessary, italy, would, defend, austria, s, independence, by, force, of, arms, dollfuss, also, exchanged, secret, letters, with, benito, mussolini, about, ways, to, guarantee, austrian, independence, mussolini, was, interested, in, austria, forming, a, buffer, zone, against, nazi, germany, dollfuss, always, stressed, the, similarity, of, the, regimes, of, hitler, in, germany, and, joseph, stalin, in, the, soviet, union, and, was, convinced, that, austrofascism, and, italian, fascism, could, counter, totalitarian, national, socialism, and, communism, in, europe, dollfuss, escaped, an, assassination, attempt, in, october, 1933, by, rudolf, dertil, a, 22, year, old, who, had, been, ejected, from, the, military, for, his, national, socialist, views, despite, the, march, coup, d, tat, the, sp, continued, to, seek, a, peaceful, resolution, but, when, the, new, austrofascist, regime, tried, to, search, the, party, s, office, in, linz, for, weapons, on, 12, february, 1934, members, of, the, schutzbund, fought, back, the, resistance, spread, and, became, the, austrian, civil, war, in, which, the, weakened, party, and, its, supporters, were, quickly, defeated, and, the, party, and, its, various, ancillary, organisations, were, banned, on, 1, may, 1934, the, dollfuss, cabinet, approved, a, new, constitution, that, abolished, freedom, of, the, press, established, one, party, system, and, created, a, total, state, monopoly, on, employer, employee, relations, this, system, remained, in, force, until, austria, became, part, of, nazi, germany, in, 1938, the, patriotic, front, government, frustrated, the, ambitions, of, pro, hitlerite, sympathizers, in, austria, who, wished, both, political, influence, and, unification, with, germany, leading, to, dollfuss, assassination, by, a, group, of, nazis, on, 25, july, 1934, his, successor, kurt, schuschnigg, maintained, the, ban, on, pro, hitlerite, activities, in, austria, but, was, forced, to, resign, on, 11, march, 1938, following, a, demand, by, adolf, hitler, for, power, sharing, with, pro, german, circles, following, schuschnigg, s, resignation, german, troops, occupied, austria, with, no, resistance, although, the, treaty, of, versailles, and, the, treaty, of, st, germain, had, explicitly, forbidden, the, unification, of, austria, and, germany, the, native, austrian, hitler, was, vastly, striving, to, annex, austria, during, the, late, 1930s, which, was, fiercely, resisted, by, the, austrian, schuschnigg, dictatorship, when, the, conflict, was, escalating, in, early, 1938, chancellor, schuschnigg, announced, a, plebiscite, on, the, issue, on, 9, march, which, was, to, take, place, on, 13, march, on, 12, march, german, troops, entered, austria, who, met, celebrating, crowds, in, order, to, install, nazi, puppet, arthur, seyss, inquart, as, chancellor, with, a, nazi, administration, already, in, place, the, country, was, now, integrated, into, nazi, germany, renamed, as, ostmark, until, 1942, when, it, was, renamed, again, as, alpen, und, donau, reichsgaue, alpine, and, danubian, gaue, a, rigged, referendum, on, 10, april, was, used, to, demonstrate, the, alleged, approval, of, the, annexation, with, a, majority, of, 99, 73, for, the, annexation, as, a, result, austria, ceased, to, exist, as, an, independent, country, this, annexation, was, enforced, by, military, invasion, but, large, parts, of, the, austrian, population, were, in, favour, of, the, nazi, regime, and, many, austrians, participated, in, its, crimes, the, jews, communists, socialist, and, hostile, politicians, were, sent, to, concentration, camps, murdered, or, forced, into, exile, just, before, the, end, of, the, war, on, 28, march, 1945, american, troops, entered, austria, and, the, soviet, union, s, red, army, crossed, the, eastern, border, two, days, later, taking, vienna, on, 13, april, american, and, british, forces, occupied, the, western, and, southern, regions, preventing, soviet, forces, from, completely, overrunning, and, controlling, the, country, according, to, the, plans, by, winston, churchill, a, south, german, state, would, be, formed, including, austria, and, bavaria, however, in, april, 1945, karl, renner, an, austrian, elder, statesman, declared, austria, separate, from, the, other, german, speaking, lands, and, set, up, a, government, which, included, socialists, conservatives, and, communists, a, significant, number, of, these, were, returning, from, exile, or, nazi, detention, having, thus, played, no, role, in, the, nazi, government, this, contributed, to, the, allies, treating, austria, more, as, a, liberated, rather, than, defeated, country, and, the, government, was, recognized, by, the, allies, later, that, year, the, country, was, occupied, by, the, allies, from, 9, may, 1945, and, under, the, allied, commission, for, austria, established, by, an, agreement, on, 4, july, 1945, it, was, divided, into, zones, occupied, respectively, by, american, british, french, and, soviet, army, personnel, with, vienna, being, also, divided, similarly, into, four, sectors, with, an, international, zone, at, its, heart, though, under, occupation, this, austrian, government, was, officially, permitted, to, conduct, foreign, relations, with, the, approval, of, the, four, occupying, powers, under, the, agreement, of, 28, june, 1946, as, part, of, this, trend, austria, was, one, of, the, founding, members, of, the, danube, commission, which, was, formed, on, 18, august, 1948, austria, would, benefit, from, the, marshall, plan, but, economic, recovery, was, slow, unlike, the, first, republic, which, had, been, characterized, by, sometimes, violent, conflict, between, the, different, political, groups, the, second, republic, became, a, stable, democracy, the, two, largest, leading, parties, the, christian, democratic, austrian, people, s, party, vp, and, the, social, democratic, party, sp, remained, in, a, coalition, led, by, the, vp, until, 1966, the, communist, party, of, austria, kp, who, had, hardly, any, support, in, the, austrian, electorate, remained, in, the, coalition, until, 1950, and, in, parliament, until, the, 1959, election, for, much, of, the, second, republic, the, only, opposition, party, was, the, freedom, party, of, austria, fp, which, included, german, nationalist, and, liberal, political, currents, it, was, founded, in, 1955, as, a, successor, organisation, to, the, short, lived, federation, of, independents, vdu, the, united, states, countered, starvation, in, 1945, 46, with, emergency, supplies, of, food, delivered, by, the, us, army, by, the, united, nations, relief, and, rehabilitation, administration, unrra, and, by, the, privately, organized, cooperative, for, american, remittances, to, europe, care, starting, in, 1947, it, funded, the, austrian, trade, deficit, large, scale, marshall, plan, aid, began, in, 1948, and, operated, in, close, cooperation, with, the, austrian, government, however, tensions, arose, when, austria, which, never, joined, nato, was, ineligible, for, the, american, shift, toward, rearmament, in, military, spending, the, us, was, also, successful, in, helping, austrian, popular, culture, adopt, american, models, in, journalism, for, example, it, sent, in, hundreds, of, experts, and, controlled, the, newsprint, closed, down, the, old, party, line, newspapers, introduced, advertising, and, wire, services, and, trained, reporters, and, editors, as, well, as, production, workers, it, founded, the, wiener, kurier, which, became, popular, as, well, as, many, magazines, such, as, medical, news, from, the, united, states, which, informed, doctors, on, new, treatments, and, drugs, the, americans, also, thoroughly, revamped, the, radio, stations, in, part, with, the, goal, of, countering, the, soviet, controlled, stations, on, an, even, larger, scale, the, education, system, was, modernized, and, democratized, by, american, experts, the, two, major, parties, strove, towards, ending, allied, occupation, and, restoring, a, fully, independent, austria, the, austrian, state, treaty, was, signed, on, 15, may, 1955, upon, the, termination, of, allied, occupation, austria, was, proclaimed, a, neutral, country, and, everlasting, neutrality, was, incorporated, into, the, constitution, on, 26, october, 1955, the, political, system, of, the, second, republic, came, to, be, characterized, by, the, system, of, proporz, meaning, that, posts, of, some, political, importance, were, split, evenly, between, members, of, the, sp, and, vp, interest, group, representations, with, mandatory, membership, e, g, for, workers, businesspeople, farmers, etc, grew, to, considerable, importance, and, were, usually, consulted, in, the, legislative, process, so, that, hardly, any, legislation, was, passed, that, did, not, reflect, widespread, consensus, the, proporz, and, consensus, systems, largely, held, even, during, the, years, between, 1966, and, 1983, when, there, were, non, coalition, governments, the, vp, sp, coalition, ended, in, 1966, when, the, vp, gained, a, majority, in, parliament, however, it, lost, it, in, 1970, when, sp, leader, bruno, kreisky, formed, a, minority, government, tolerated, by, the, fp, in, the, elections, of, 1971, 1975, and, 1979, he, obtained, an, absolute, majority, the, 70s, were, then, seen, as, a, time, of, liberal, reforms, in, social, policy, today, the, economic, policies, of, the, kreisky, era, are, often, criticized, as, the, accumulation, of, a, large, national, debt, began, and, non, profitable, nationalized, industries, were, strongly, subsidized, following, severe, losses, in, the, 1983, elections, the, sp, entered, into, a, coalition, with, the, fp, under, the, leadership, of,
