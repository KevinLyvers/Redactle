britain, austria, prussia, russia, and, several, other, countries, the, wars, are, divided, into, two, periods, the, war, of, the, first, coalition, 1792, 1797, and, the, war, of, the, second, coalition, 1798, 1802, initially, confined, to, europe, the, fighting, gradually, assumed, a, global, dimension, after, a, decade, of, constant, warfare, and, aggressive, diplomacy, france, had, conquered, territories, in, the, italian, peninsula, the, low, countries, and, the, rhineland, due, to, its, very, large, and, powerful, military, which, had, been, totally, mobilized, for, war, against, most, of, europe, with, mass, conscription, of, the, vast, french, population, french, success, in, these, conflicts, ensured, military, occupation, and, the, spread, of, revolutionary, principles, over, much, of, europe, as, early, as, 1791, the, other, monarchies, of, europe, looked, with, outrage, at, the, revolution, and, its, upheavals, and, they, considered, whether, they, should, intervene, either, in, support, of, king, louis, xvi, to, prevent, the, spread, of, revolution, or, to, take, advantage, of, the, chaos, in, france, austria, stationed, significant, troops, on, its, french, border, and, together, with, prussia, issued, the, declaration, of, pillnitz, which, threatened, severe, consequences, should, anything, happen, to, king, louis, xvi, and, queen, marie, antoinette, after, austria, refused, to, recall, its, troops, from, the, french, border, and, to, back, down, on, the, perceived, threat, of, using, force, france, declared, war, on, austria, and, prussia, in, the, spring, of, 1792, both, countries, responded, with, a, coordinated, invasion, that, was, eventually, turned, back, at, the, battle, of, valmy, in, september, this, victory, emboldened, the, national, convention, to, abolish, the, monarchy, a, series, of, victories, by, the, new, french, armies, abruptly, ended, with, defeat, at, neerwinden, in, the, spring, of, 1793, the, french, suffered, additional, defeats, in, the, remainder, of, the, year, and, these, difficult, times, allowed, the, jacobins, to, rise, to, power, and, impose, the, reign, of, terror, to, unify, the, nation, in, 1794, the, situation, improved, dramatically, for, the, french, as, huge, victories, at, fleurus, against, the, austrians, and, dutch, and, at, the, black, mountain, against, the, spanish, signaled, the, start, of, a, new, stage, in, the, wars, by, 1795, the, french, had, captured, the, austrian, netherlands, and, the, dutch, republic, the, french, also, put, spain, and, prussia, out, of, the, war, with, the, peace, of, basel, a, hitherto, unknown, general, named, napoleon, bonaparte, began, his, first, campaign, in, italy, in, april, 1796, in, less, than, a, year, french, armies, under, napoleon, destroyed, the, habsburg, forces, and, evicted, them, from, the, italian, peninsula, winning, almost, every, battle, and, capturing, 150, 000, prisoners, with, french, forces, marching, toward, vienna, the, austrians, sued, for, peace, and, agreed, to, the, treaty, of, campo, formio, ending, the, first, coalition, against, the, republic, the, war, of, the, second, coalition, began, in, 1798, with, the, french, invasion, of, egypt, headed, by, napoleon, the, allies, took, the, opportunity, presented, by, the, french, effort, in, the, middle, east, to, regain, territories, lost, from, the, first, coalition, the, war, began, well, for, the, allies, in, europe, where, they, gradually, pushed, the, french, out, of, italy, and, invaded, switzerland, racking, up, victories, at, the, battles, of, magnano, cassano, and, novi, along, the, way, however, their, efforts, largely, unraveled, with, the, french, victory, at, zurich, in, september, 1799, which, caused, russia, to, drop, out, of, the, war, meanwhile, napoleon, s, forces, annihilated, a, series, of, egyptian, and, ottoman, armies, at, the, battles, of, the, pyramids, mount, tabor, and, abukir, these, victories, in, egypt, further, enhanced, napoleon, s, popularity, back, in, france, and, he, returned, in, triumph, in, the, autumn, of, 1799, although, the, egyptian, campaign, ultimately, ended, in, failure, furthermore, the, royal, navy, had, won, the, battle, of, the, nile, in, 1798, further, strengthening, british, control, of, the, mediterranean, and, weakening, the, french, navy, napoleon, s, arrival, from, egypt, led, to, the, fall, of, the, directory, in, the, coup, of, 18, brumaire, with, napoleon, installing, himself, as, consul, napoleon, then, reorganized, the, french, army, and, launched, a, new, assault, against, the, austrians, in, italy, during, the, spring, of, 1800, this, brought, a, decisive, french, victory, at, the, battle, of, marengo, in, june, 1800, after, which, the, austrians, withdrew, from, the, peninsula, once, again, another, crushing, french, triumph, at, hohenlinden, in, bavaria, forced, the, austrians, to, seek, peace, for, a, second, time, leading, to, the, treaty, of, lun, ville, in, 1801, with, austria, and, russia, out, of, the, war, britain, found, itself, increasingly, isolated, and, agreed, to, the, treaty, of, amiens, with, napoleon, s, government, in, 1802, concluding, the, revolutionary, wars, however, the, lingering, tensions, proved, too, difficult, to, contain, and, the, napoleonic, wars, began, over, a, year, later, with, the, formation, of, the, third, coalition, continuing, the, series, of, coalition, wars, when, the, french, revolution, started, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, european, continent, had, five, great, powers, these, being, great, britain, france, austria, russia, and, prussia, weak, european, states, included, sweden, spain, poland, holland, and, turkey, western, germany, was, divided, into, hundreds, of, tiny, principalities, cities, and, minor, states, some, of, which, were, independents, while, others, were, effectively, controlled, by, austria, the, great, powers, had, agrarian, industries, except, for, great, britain, which, was, wealthy, because, of, trade, the, key, figure, in, initial, foreign, reaction, to, the, french, revolution, was, holy, roman, emperor, leopold, ii, brother, of, queen, marie, antoinette, of, france, leopold, had, initially, looked, on, the, revolution, with, equanimity, but, became, more, disturbed, as, the, revolution, became, more, radical, although, he, still, hoped, to, avoid, war, on, 27, august, 1791, leopold, and, king, frederick, william, ii, of, prussia, in, consultation, with, emigrant, french, nobles, issued, the, declaration, of, pillnitz, which, declared, the, interest, of, the, monarchs, of, europe, in, the, well, being, of, king, louis, xvi, of, france, and, his, family, and, threatened, vague, but, severe, consequences, if, anything, should, befall, them, although, leopold, saw, the, pillnitz, declaration, as, a, non, committal, gesture, to, placate, the, sentiments, of, french, monarchists, and, nobles, it, was, seen, in, france, as, a, serious, threat, and, was, denounced, by, the, revolutionary, leaders, france, eventually, issued, an, ultimatum, demanding, that, leopold, renounce, any, hostile, alliances, and, withdraw, his, troops, from, the, french, border, the, reply, was, evasive, and, the, french, assembly, voted, for, war, on, 20, april, 1792, against, francis, ii, the, successor, of, leopold, ii, after, a, long, list, of, grievances, presented, by, foreign, minister, charles, fran, ois, dumouriez, dumouriez, prepared, an, immediate, invasion, of, the, austrian, netherlands, where, he, expected, the, local, population, to, rise, against, austrian, rule, as, they, had, earlier, in, 1790, however, the, revolution, had, thoroughly, disorganized, the, army, and, the, forces, raised, were, insufficient, for, the, invasion, following, the, declaration, of, war, french, soldiers, deserted, en, masse, and, in, one, case, murdered, their, general, th, obald, dillon, while, the, revolutionary, government, frantically, raised, fresh, troops, and, reorganized, its, armies, a, mostly, prussian, allied, army, under, charles, william, ferdinand, duke, of, brunswick, assembled, at, koblenz, on, the, rhine, the, duke, then, issued, a, proclamation, called, the, brunswick, manifesto, july, 1792, written, by, the, french, king, s, cousin, louis, joseph, de, bourbon, prince, de, cond, the, leader, of, an, migr, corps, within, the, allied, army, which, declared, the, allies, intent, to, restore, the, king, to, his, full, powers, and, to, treat, any, person, or, town, who, opposed, them, as, rebels, to, be, condemned, to, death, by, martial, law, this, however, had, the, effect, of, strengthening, the, resolve, of, the, revolutionary, army, and, government, to, oppose, them, by, any, means, necessary, on, 10, august, a, crowd, stormed, the, tuileries, palace, seizing, the, king, and, his, family, the, commune, of, paris, later, assumed, the, powers, of, the, municipality, on, 19, august, 1792, the, invasion, by, brunswick, s, army, commenced, with, brunswick, s, army, easily, taking, the, fortresses, of, longwy, and, verdun, the, invasion, continued, but, at, valmy, on, 20, september, the, invaders, came, to, a, stalemate, against, dumouriez, and, kellermann, in, which, the, highly, professional, french, artillery, distinguished, itself, although, the, battle, was, a, tactical, draw, it, gave, a, great, boost, to, french, morale, further, the, prussians, finding, that, the, campaign, had, been, longer, and, more, costly, than, predicted, decided, that, the, cost, and, risk, of, continued, fighting, was, too, great, and, with, winter, approaching, they, decided, to, retreat, from, france, to, preserve, their, army, the, next, day, the, monarchy, was, formally, abolished, as, the, first, republic, was, declared, 21, september, 1792, meanwhile, the, french, had, been, successful, on, several, other, fronts, occupying, savoy, and, nice, which, were, parts, of, the, savoyard, state, while, general, custine, invaded, germany, occupying, several, german, towns, along, the, rhine, and, reaching, as, far, as, frankfurt, dumouriez, went, on, the, offensive, in, the, austrian, netherlands, once, again, winning, a, great, victory, over, the, austrians, at, the, battle, of, jemappes, on, 6, november, and, occupying, the, entire, country, by, the, beginning, of, winter, spain, and, portugal, entered, the, anti, french, coalition, in, january, 1793, britain, began, military, preparations, in, late, 1792, and, declared, that, war, was, inevitable, unless, france, gave, up, its, conquests, notwithstanding, french, assurances, they, would, not, attack, holland, or, annex, the, low, countries, britain, expelled, the, french, ambassador, following, the, execution, of, louis, xvi, and, on, 1, february, france, responded, by, declaring, war, on, great, britain, and, the, dutch, republic, france, drafted, hundreds, of, thousands, of, men, beginning, a, policy, of, using, mass, conscription, to, deploy, more, of, its, manpower, than, the, autocratic, states, could, manage, to, do, first, stage, with, a, decree, of, 24, february, 1793, ordering, the, draft, of, 300, 000, men, followed, by, the, general, mobilization, of, all, the, young, men, able, to, be, drafted, through, the, famous, decree, of, 23, august, 1793, nonetheless, the, coalition, allies, launched, a, determined, drive, to, invade, france, during, the, flanders, campaign, france, suffered, severe, reverses, at, first, they, were, driven, out, of, the, austrian, netherlands, and, serious, revolts, flared, in, the, west, and, south, of, france, one, of, these, at, toulon, was, the, first, serious, taste, of, action, for, an, unknown, young, artillery, officer, napoleon, bonaparte, he, contributed, to, the, siege, of, the, city, and, its, harbour, by, planning, an, effective, assault, with, well, placed, artillery, batteries, raining, projectiles, down, on, rebel, positions, this, performance, helped, make, his, reputation, as, a, capable, tactician, and, it, fueled, his, meteoric, rise, to, military, and, political, power, by, the, end, of, the, year, large, new, armies, had, turned, back, foreign, invaders, and, the, reign, of, terror, a, fierce, policy, of, repression, had, suppressed, internal, revolts, the, french, military, was, in, the, ascendant, lazare, carnot, a, scientist, and, prominent, member, of, the, committee, of, public, safety, organized, the, fourteen, armies, of, the, republic, and, was, then, nicknamed, the, organizer, of, the, victory, the, year, 1794, brought, increased, success, to, the, french, armies, on, the, alpine, frontier, there, was, little, change, with, the, french, invasion, of, piedmont, failing, on, the, spanish, border, the, french, under, general, dugommier, rallied, from, their, defensive, positions, at, bayonne, and, perpignan, driving,

vosges, the, second, of, which, was, successful, but, not, followed, up, allowing, for, a, prussian, counter, attack, in, september, otherwise, this, sector, of, the, front, was, largely, quiet, over, the, course, of, the, year, at, sea, the, french, atlantic, fleet, succeeded, in, holding, off, a, british, attempt, to, interdict, a, vital, cereal, convoy, from, the, united, states, on, the,

over, the, weak, and, poorly, supplied, army, of, italy, arriving, on, 26, march, the, army, was, already, being, reorganised, and, supplied, when, he, arrived, and, he, found, that, the, situation, was, rapidly, improving, he, was, soon, able, to, carry, out, the, plan, for, the, invasion, of, italy, that, he, had, been, advocating, for, years, which, provided, for, an, advance, over, the, apennines, near, altare, to, attack, the, enemy, position, of, ceva, the, montenotte, campaign, opened, after, johann, beaulieu, s, austrian, forces, attacked, the, extreme, french, eastern, flank,

crossed, the, po, at, piacenza, nearly, cutting, the, austrian, line, of, retreat, the, austrians, escaped, after, the, battle, of, fombio, but, had, their, rear, guard, mauled, at, lodi, on, 10, may, after, which, the, french, took, milan, bonaparte, then, advanced, eastwards, again, drove, off, the, austrians, in, the, battle, of, borghetto, and, in, june, began, the, siege, of, mantua, mantua, was, the, strongest, austrian, base, in, italy, meanwhile, the, austrians, retreated, north, into, the, foothills, of, the, tyrol, during, july, and, august, austria, sent, a, fresh, army, into, italy, under, dagobert, wurmser, wurmser, attacked, toward, mantua, along, the, east, side, of, lake, garda, sending, peter, quasdanovich, down, the, west, side, in, an, effort, to, envelop, bonaparte, bonaparte, exploited, the, austrian, mistake, of, dividing, their, forces, to, defeat, them, in, detail, but, in, so, doing, he, abandoned, the, siege, of, mantua, which, held, out, for, another, six, months, carl, von, clausewitz, mentioned, in, on, war, that, the, siege, might, have, been, able, to, be, kept, up, if, bonaparte, had, circumvallated, the, city, quasdanovich, was, overcome, at, lonato, on, 3, august, and, wurmser, at, castiglione, on, 5, august, wurmser, retreated, to, the, tyrol, and, bonaparte, resumed, the, siege, in, september, bonaparte, marched, north, against, trento, in, tyrol, but, wurmser, had, already, marched, toward, mantua, by, the, brenta, valley, leaving, paul, davidovich, s, force, to, hold, off, the, french, bonaparte, overran, the, holding, force, at, the, battle, of, rovereto, then, he, followed, wurmser, down, the, brenta, valley, to, fall, upon, and, defeat, the, austrians, at, the, battle, of, bassano, on, 8, september, wurmser, elected, to, march, for, mantua, with, a, large, portion, of, his, surviving, troops, the, austrians, evaded, bonaparte, s, attempts, to, intercept, them, but, were, driven, into, the, city, after, a, pitched, battle, on, 15, september, this, left, nearly, 30, 000, austrians, trapped, in, the, fortress, this, number, rapidly, diminished, due, to, disease, combat, losses, and, hunger, the, austrians, sent, yet, another, army, under, j, zsef, alvinczi, against, bonaparte, in, november, again, the, austrians, divided, their, effort, sending, davidovich, s, corps, from, the, north, while, alvinczi, s, main, body, attacked, from, the, east, at, first, they, proved, victorious, over, the, french, at, bassano, calliano, and, caldiero, but, bonaparte, ultimately, defeated, alvinczi, in, the, battle, of, arcole, southeast, of, verona, the, french, then, turned, on, davidovich, in, great, strength, and, chased, him, into, the, tyrol, wurmser, s, only, sortie, was, late, and, ineffectual, the, rebellion, in, the, vend, e, was, also, finally, crushed, in, 1796, by, hoche, but, hoche, s, attempt, to, land, a, large, invasion, force, in, ireland, was, unsuccessful, on, 14, february, british, admiral, jervis, met, and, defeated, a, spanish, fleet, off, portugal, at, the, battle, of, cape, st, vincent, this, prevented, the, spanish, fleet, from, rendezvousing, with, the, french, removing, a, threat, of, invasion, to, britain, however, the, british, fleet, was, weakened, over, the, rest, of, the, year, by, the, spithead, and, nore, mutinies, which, kept, many, ships, in, port, through, the, summer, on, 22, february, french, invasion, force, consisting, of, 1, 400, troops, from, the, la, legion, noire, the, black, legion, under, the, command, of, irish, american,

concluded, the, peace, of, leoben, in, april, ending, hostilities, however, his, absence, from, italy, had, allowed, the, outbreak, of, the, revolt, known, as, the, veronese, easters, on, 17, april, which, was, put, down, eight, days, later, although, britain, remained, at, war, with, france, this, effectively, ended, the, first, coalition, austria, later, signed, the, treaty, of, campo, formio,

britain, left, to, fight, and, not, enough, of, a, navy, to, fight, a, direct, war, napoleon, conceived, of, an, invasion, of, egypt, in, 1798, which, satisfied, his, personal, desire, for, glory, and, the, directory, s, desire, to, have, him, far, from, paris, the, military, objective, of, the, expedition, is, not, entirely, clear, but, may, have, been, to, threaten, british, dominance, in,

treaty, with, austria, the, french, forces, easily, handled, the, peasants, rebellion, in, the, southern, netherlands, and, were, able, to, put, down, the, revolting, forces, in, under, 2, months, the, french, in, 1798, fought, an, undeclared, war, at, sea, against, the, united, states, that, was, known, variously, as, the, quasi, war, the, half, war, and, the, pirate, wars, it, was, resolved, peaceably, with, the, convention, of, 1800, britain, and, austria, organized, a, new, coalition, against, france, in, 1798, including, for, the, first, time, the, russian, empire, although, no, action, occurred, until, 1799, except, against, the, kingdom, of, naples, in, egypt, napoleon, had, consolidated, his, control, of, the, country, for, the, time, being, soon, after, the, beginning, of, the, year, he, mounted, an, invasion, of, ottoman, syria, capturing, el, arish, and, jaffa, on, 17, march, he, laid, siege, to, acre, and, defeated, an, ottoman, effort, to, relieve, the, city,

he, sailed, through, the, british, blockade, to, return, to, paris, and, resolved, to, take, control, of, the, government, there, in, a, coup, in, europe, the, french, army, of, observation, organized, with, 30, 000, men, in, four, divisions, crossed, the, rhine, at, kehl, and, basel, in, march, 1799, the, following, day, it, was, renamed, the, army, of, the, danube, under, command, of,

freudenstadt, this, column, eventually, became, the, left, flank, it, was, followed, across, the, rhine, also, at, kehl, by, the, ii, division, the, third, division, and, the, reserve, also, crossed, at, kehl, and, then, divided, into, two, columns, iii, division, traveling, through, the, black, forest, via, oberkirch, and, the, reserve, with, most, of, the, artillery, and, horse, by, the, valley, at, freiburg, im, breisgau, where, they, would, find, more, forage, and, then, over, the, mountains, past, the, titisee, to, l, ffingen, and, h, fingen, the, major, part, of, the, imperial, army, under, command, of, the, archduke, charles, had, wintered, immediately, east, of, the, lech, which, jourdan, knew, because, he, had, sent, agents, into, germany, with, instructions, to, identify, the, location, and, strength, of, his, enemy, this, was, less, than, 64, kilometres, 40, mi, distant, any, passage, over, the, lech, was, facilitated, by, available, bridges, both, of, permanent, construction, and, temporary, pontoons, and, a, traverse, through, friendly, territory, in, march, 1799, the, army, of, the, danube, engaged, in, two, major, battles, both, in, the, southwestern, german, theater, at, the, intensely, fought, battle, of, ostrach, 21, 2, march, 1799, the, first, battle, of, the, war, of, the, second, coalition, austrian, forces, under, the, command, of, archduke, charles, defeated, jourdan, s, army, of, the, danube, the, french, suffered, significant, losses, and, were, forced, to, retreat, from, the, region, taking, up, new, positions, to, the, west, at, me, kirch, messkirch, m, kirch, and, then, at, stockach, and, engen, at, the, second, battle, in, stockach, on, 27, march, 1799, the, austrian, army, achieved, a, decisive, victory, over, the, french, forces, and, again, pushed, the, french, army, west, jourdan, instructed, his, generals, to, take, up, positions, in, the, black, forest, and, he, himself, established, a, base, at, hornberg, from, there, general, jourdan, relegated, command, of, the, army, to, his, chief, of, staff, jean, augustin, ernouf, and, traveled, to, paris, to, ask, for, more, and, better, troops, and, ultimately, to, request, a, medical, leave, the, army, was, reorganized, and, a, portion, placed, under, the, command, of, andr, mass, na, and, merged, with, the, army, of, helvetia, following, the, reorganization, and, change, in, command, the, army, participated, in, several, skirmishes, and, actions, on, the, eastern, part, of, the, swiss, plateau, including, the, battle, of, winterthur, after, this, action, three, forces, of, the, imperial, army, united, north, of, z, rich, completing, a, partial, encirclement, of, mass, na, s, combined, army, of, the, danube, and, army, of, switzerland, a, few, days, later, at, the, first, battle, of, zurich, mass, na, was, forced, west, across, the, limmat, in, late, summer, 1799, charles, was, ordered, to, support, imperial, activities, in, the, middle, rhineland, he, withdrew, north, across, the, rhine, and, marched, toward, mannheim, leaving, z, rich, and, northern, switzerland, in, the, hands, of, the, inexperienced, alexander, korsakov, and, 25, 000, russian, troops, although, the, highly, capable, friedrich, freiherr, von, hotze, remained, in, support, his, 15, 000, men, were, not, able, to, counter, korsakov, s, poor, defensive, arrangements, three, weeks, later, at, the, second, battle, of, zurich, the, russian, force, was, annihilated, and, hotze, was, killed, south, of, z, rich, this, left, mass, na, in, control, of, northern, switzerland, and, forced, alexander, suvorov, into, an, arduous, three, week, march, into, the, vorarlberg, where, his, troops, arrived, starving, and, exhausted, in, mid, october, napoleon, himself, invaded, syria, from, egypt, but, after, a, failed, siege, of, acre, retreated, to, egypt, repelling, a, british, turkish, invasion, alerted, to, the, political, and, military, crisis, in, france, he, returned, leaving, his, army, behind, and, used, his, popularity, and, army, support, to, mount, a, coup, that, made, him, first, consul, the, head, of, the, french, government, in, italy, the, austrians, under, general, michael, von, melas, attacked, first, and, by, the, third, week, in, april, had, advanced, to, the, var, with, mass, na, and, half, his, army, in, genoa, besieged, by, land, by, the, austrians, and, under, tight, blockade, by, the, royal, navy, in, response, berthier, moved, not, to, the, threatened, frontier, but, to, geneva, and, mass, na, was, instructed, to, hold, genoa, until, 4, june, the, army, of, the, reserve, was, joined, by, napoleon, and, in, mid, may, set, out, to, cross, the, alps, to, attack, the, austrian, rear, the, bulk, of, the, army, crossed, by, the, great, st, bernard, pass, still, under, snow, and, by, 24, may, 40, 000, troops, were, in, the, valley, of, the, po, artillery, was, man, hauled, over, with, great, effort, and, ingenuity, however, an, austrian, held, fort, on, the, italian, side, although, bypassed, by, infantry, and, cavalry, prevented, most, of, the, artillery, reaching, the, plains, of, northern, italy, until, the, start, of, june, once, over, the, alps, napoleon, did, not, proceed, directly, to, the, relief, of, genoa, instead, he, advanced, on, milan, to, improve, his, lines, of, communication, via, the, simplon, and, st, gotthard, passes, and, to, threaten, melas, s, lines, of, communication, with, mantua, and, vienna, in, the, belief, that, this, would, cause, melas, to, raise, the, siege, of, genoa, he, entered, milan, on, 2, june, and, by, crossing, to, the, south, bank, of, the, po, completely, cut, melas, s, communications, taking, up, a, strong, defensive, position, at, stradella, he, confidently, awaited, an, attempt, by, the, austrian, army, to, fight, its, way, out, however, melas, had, not, raised, the, siege, of, genoa, and, on, 4, june, mass, na, had, duly, capitulated, napoleon, then, faced, the, possibility, that, thanks, to, the, british, command, of, the, mediterranean, far, from, falling, back, the, austrians, could, instead, take, genoa, as, their, new, base, and, be, supplied, by, sea, his, defensive, posture, would, not, prevent, this, he, had, to, find, and, attack, the, austrians, before, they, could, regroup, he, therefore, advanced, from, stradella, towards, alessandria, where, melas, was, apparently, doing, nothing, convinced, that, melas, was, about, to, retreat, napoleon, sent, strong, detachments, to, block, melas, s, routes, northwards, to, the, po, and, southwards, to, genoa, at, this, point, melas, attacked, and, for, all, the, brilliance, of, the, previous, campaign, napoleon, found, himself, at, a, significant, disadvantage, in, the, consequent, battle, of, marengo, 14, june, napoleon, and, the, french, came, under, huge, pressure, in, the, early, hours, of, the, battle, melas, believed, he, had, already, won, and, turned, over, delivery, of, the, final, blow, to, a, subordinate, suddenly, the, prompt, return, of, a, detached, french, force, under, desaix, and, a, vigorous, french, counter, attack, converted, the, battle, into, a, decisive, french, victory, the, austrians, lost, half, of, their, army, but, desaix, was, one, of, the, french, victims, melas, promptly, entered, into, negotiations, which, led, to, the, austrians, evacuating, northern, italy, west, of, the, ticino, and, suspending, military, operations, in, italy, napoleon, returned, to, paris, after, the, victory, leaving, brune, to, consolidate, in, italy, and, begin, a, march, toward, austria, in, the, german, theater, the, armies, of, france, and, austria, faced, each, other, across, the, rhine, at, the, beginning, of, 1800, feldzeugmeister, p, l, kray, led, approximately, 120, 000, troops, in, addition, to, his, austrian, regulars, his, force, included, 12, 000, men, from, the, electorate, of, bavaria, 6, 000, troops, from, the, duchy, of, w, rttemberg, 5, 000, soldiers, of, low, quality, from, the, electorate, of, mainz, and, 7, 000, militiamen, from, the, county, of, tyrol, of, these, 25, 000, men, were, deployed, east, of, lake, constance, to, protect, the, vorarlberg, kray, posted, his, main, body, of, 95, 000, soldiers, in, the, l, shaped, angle, where, the, rhine, changes, direction, from, a, westward, flow, along, the, northern, border, of, switzerland, to, a, northward, flow, along, the, eastern, border, of, france, unwisely, kray, set, up, his, main, magazine, at, stockach, near, the, northwestern, end, of, lake, constance, only, a, day, s, march, from, french, held, switzerland, general, of, division, jean, victor, marie, moreau, commanded, a, modestly, equipped, army, of, 137, 000, french, troops, of, these, 108, 000, troops, were, available, for, field, operations, while, the, other, 29, 000, watched, the, swiss, border, and, held, the, rhine, fortresses, first, consul, napoleon, bonaparte, offered, a, plan, of, operations, based, on, outflanking, the, austrians, by, a, push, from, switzerland, but, moreau, declined, to, follow, it, rather, moreau, planned, to, cross, the, rhine, near, basel, where, the, river, swung, to, the, north, a, french, column, would, distract, kray, from, moreau, s, true, intentions, by, crossing, the, rhine, from, the, west, bonaparte, wanted, claude, lecourbe, s, corps, to, be, detached, to, italy, after, the, initial, battles, but, moreau, had, other, plans, through, a, series, of, complicated, maneuvers, in, which, he, flanked, double, flanked, and, reflanked, kray, s, army, moreau, s, army, lay, on, the, eastern, slope, of, the, black, forest, while, portions, of, kray, s, army, was, still, guarding, the, passes, on, the, other, side, on, 3, may, 1800, moreau, and, kray, fought, the, battles, of, engen, and, stockach, the, fighting, near, engen, resulted, in, a, stalemate, with, heavy, losses, on, both, sides, however, while, the, two, main, armies, were, engaged, at, engen, claude, lecourbe, captured, stockach, from, its, austrian, defenders, under, joseph, louis, prince, of, lorraine, vaud, mont, the, loss, of, this, main, supply, base, at, stockach, compelled, kray, to, order, a, retreat, to, me, kirch, where, they, enjoyed, a, more, favourable, defensive, position, however, it, also, meant, that, any, retreat, by, kray, into, austria, via, switzerland, and, the, vorarlberg, was, cut, off, on, 4, and, 5, may, the, french, launched, repeated, and, fruitless, assaults, on, the, me, kirch, at, nearby, krumbach, where, the, austrians, also, had, the, superiority, of, position, and, force, the, 1st, demi, brigade, took, the, village, and, the, heights, around, it, which, gave, them, a, commanding, aspect, over, me, kirch, subsequently, kray, withdrew, his, forces, to, sigmaringen, followed, closely, by, the, french, fighting, at, nearby, biberach, an, der, ris, ensued, on, 9, may, action, principally, consisted, of, the, 25, 000, man, strong, french, center, commanded, by, laurent, de, gouvion, saint, cyr, after, being, flanked, by, general, moreau, who, approached, ulm, from, the, east, and, overwhelmed, his, outposts, at, battle, of, h, chst, dt, kray, retreated, to, munich, again, on, 10, may, the, austrians, withdrew, with, heavy, losses, this, time, to, ulm, a, several, month, armistice, followed, during, which, kray, was, replaced, by, the, archduke, john, with, the, austrian, army, retiring, behind, the, river, inn, austrian, reluctance, to, accept, negotiated, terms, caused, the, french, to, end, the, armistice, in, mid, november, effective, in, two, weeks, when, the, armistice, ended, john, advanced, over, the, inn, towards, munich, his, army, was, defeated, in, small, engagements, at, the, battles, of, ampfing, and, neuburg, an, der, donau, and, decisively, in, the, forests, before, the, city, at, hohenlinden, on, 3, december, moreau, began, a, march, on, vienna, and, the, austrians, soon, sued, for, peace, ending, the, war, on, the, continent, by, 9, february, the, austrians, had, signed, the, treaty, of, lun, ville, ending, the, war, on, the, continent, the, war, against, the, united, kingdom, continued, with, neapolitan, harbours, closed, to, her, by, the, treaty, of, florence, signed, on, 28, march, and, the, turks, invaded, egypt, in, march, losing, to, kl, ber, at, heliopolis, the, exhausted, french, force, in, egypt, however, surrendered, in, august, the, naval, war, also, continued, with, the, united,

unsuccessful, british, admiral, horatio, nelson, defied, orders, and, attacked, the, danish, fleet, in, harbour, at, the, battle, of, copenhagen, destroying, much, of, it, an, armistice, prevented, him, from, continuing, into, the, baltic, sea, to, attack, the, russian, fleet, at, reval, tallinn, meanwhile, off, gibraltar, the, outnumbered, french, squadron, under, linois, rebuffed, a, first, british, attack, under, saumarez, in, the, first, battle, of, algeciras, capturing, a, line, of, battle, ship, in, the, second, battle, of, algeciras, four, days, later, the, british, captured, a, french, ship, and, sank, two, others, killing, around, 2000, french, for, the, loss, of, 12, british, in, 1802, the, british, and, french, signed, the, treaty, of, amiens, ending, the, war, the, peace, held, for, less, than, a, year, but, still, constituted, the, longest, period, of, peace, between, the, two, countries, during, the, period, 1793, 1815, the, treaty, is, generally, considered, to, be, the, most, appropriate, point, to, mark, the, transition, between, the, french, revolutionary, wars, and, the, napoleonic, wars, although, napoleon, was, not, crowned, emperor, until, 1804, the, french, revolution, transformed, nearly, all, aspects, of, french, and, european, life, the, powerful, sociopolitical, forces, unleashed, by, a, people, seeking, libert, galit, and, fraternit, made, certain, that, even, warfare, was, not, spared, this, upheaval, eighteenth, century, armies, with, their, rigid, protocols, static, operational, strategy, unenthusiastic, soldiers, and, aristocratic, officer, classes, underwent, massive, remodeling, as, the, french, monarchy, and, nobility, gave, way, to, liberal, assemblies, obsessed, with, external, threats, the, fundamental, shifts, in, warfare, that, occurred, during, the, period, have, prompted, scholars, to, identify, the, era, as, the, beginning, of, modern, war, in, 1791, the, legislative, assembly, passed, the, drill, book, legislation, implementing, a, series, of, infantry, doctrines, created, by, french, theorists, because, of, their, defeat, by, the, prussians, in, the, seven, years, war, the, new, developments, hoped, to, exploit, the, intrinsic, bravery, of, the, french, soldier, made, even, more, powerful, by, the, explosive, nationalist, forces, of, the, revolution, the, changes, also, placed, a, faith, on, the, ordinary, soldier, that, would, be, completely, unacceptable, in, earlier, times, french, troops, were, expected, to, harass, the, enemy, and, remain, loyal, enough, to, not, desert, a, benefit, other, ancien, r, gime, armies, did, not, have, following, the, declaration, of, war, in, 1792, an, imposing, array, of, enemies, converging, on, french, borders, prompted, the, government, in, paris, to, adopt, radical, measures, the, day, 23, august, 1793, would, become, a, historic, one, in, military, history, on, that, date, the, national, convention, called, a, lev, e, en, masse, or, mass, conscription, for, the, first, time, in, human, history, by, summer, of, the, following, year, conscription, made, some, 500, 000, men, available, for, service, and, the, french, began, to, deal, blows, to, their, european, enemies, armies, during, the, revolution, became, noticeably, larger, than, their, holy, roman, counterparts, and, combined, with, the, new, enthusiasm, of, the, troops, the, tactical, and, strategic, opportunities, became, profound, by, 1797, the, french, had, defeated, the, first, coalition, occupied, the, low, countries, the, west, bank, of, the, rhine, and, northern, italy, objectives, which, had, defied, the, valois, and, bourbon, dynasties, for, centuries, unsatisfied, with, the, results, many, european, powers, formed, a, second, coalition, but, by, 1801, this, too, had, been, decisively, beaten, another, key, aspect, of, french, success, was, the, changes, wrought, in, the, officer, classes, traditionally, european, armies, left, major, command, positions, to, those, who, could, be, trusted, namely, the, aristocracy, the, hectic, nature, of, the, french, revolution, however, tore, apart, france, s, old, army, meaning, new, men, were, required, to, become, officers, and, commanders, in, addition, to, opening, a, flood, of, tactical, and, strategic, opportunities, the, revolutionary, wars, also, laid, the, foundation, for, modern, military, theory, later, authors, who, wrote, about, nations, in, arms, drew, inspiration, from, the, french, revolution, in, which, dire, circumstances, seemingly, mobilized, the, entire, french, nation, for, war, and, incorporated, nationalism, into, the, fabric, of, military, history, although, the, reality, of, war, in, the, france, of, 1795, would, be, different, from, that, in, the, france, of, 1915, conceptions, and, mentalities, of, war, evolved, significantly, clausewitz, correctly, analyzed, the, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, eras, to, give, posterity, a, thorough, and, complete, theory, of, war, that, emphasized, struggles, between, nations, occurring, everywhere, from, the, battlefield, to, the, legislative, assemblies, and, to, the, very, way, that, people, think, war, now, emerged, as, a, vast, panorama, of, physical, and, psychological, forces, heading, for, victory, or, defeat
