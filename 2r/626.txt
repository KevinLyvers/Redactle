tyre, t, a, r, arabic, romanized, r, phoenician, romanized, r, hebrew, romanized, r, greek, translit, t, ros, is, a, city, in, lebanon, one, of, the, oldest, continuously, inhabited, cities, in, the, world, though, in, medieval, times, for, some, centuries, by, just, a, small, population, it, was, one, of, the, earliest, phoenician, metropolises, and, the, legendary, birthplace, of, europa, her, brothers, cadmus, and, phoenix, as, well, as, carthage, s, founder, dido, elissa, the, city, has, many, ancient, sites, including, the, tyre, hippodrome, and, was, added, as, a, whole, to, the, list, of, unesco, world, heritage, sites, in, 1984, the, historian, ernest, renan, noted, that, one, can, call, tyre, a, city, of, ruins, built, out, of, ruins, today, tyre, is, the, fourth, largest, city, in, lebanon, after, beirut, tripoli, and, sidon, it, is, the, capital, of, the, tyre, district, in, the, south, governorate, there, were, approximately, 200, 000, inhabitants, in, the, tyre, urban, area, in, 2016, including, many, refugees, as, the, city, hosts, three, of, the, twelve, palestinian, refugee, camps, in, lebanon, burj, el, shimali, el, buss, and, rashidieh, tyre, juts, out, from, the, coast, of, the, mediterranean, sea, and, is, located, about, 80, km, 50, mi, south, of, beirut, it, originally, consisted, of, two, distinct, urban, centres, tyre, itself, which, was, on, an, island, just, 500, to, 700m, offshore, and, the, associated, settlement, of, ushu, on, the, adjacent, mainland, later, called, palaetyrus, meaning, old, tyre, in, ancient, greek, the, fortified, city, was, on, top, of, a, rock, from, which, its, name, was, inherited, as, s, r, is, the, phoenician, word, for, rock, it, had, two, ports, the, sidonian, port, to, the, north, still, partly, existing, today, and, the, egyptian, port, to, the, south, which, has, perhaps, been, discovered, very, recently, throughout, history, from, prehistoric, times, onwards, all, settlements, in, the, tyre, area, profited, from, the, abundance, of, fresh, water, supplies, especially, from, the, nearby, springs, of, rashidieh, and, ras, al, ain, in, the, south, in, addition, there, are, the, springs, of, al, bagbog, and, ain, ebreen, in, the, north, as, well, as, the, litani, river, also, known, as, alqasymieh, the, present, city, of, tyre, covers, a, large, part, of, the, original, island, and, has, expanded, onto, and, covers, most, of, the, causeway, built, by, alexander, the, great, in, 332, bce, this, isthmus, increased, greatly, in, width, over, the, centuries, because, of, extensive, silt, depositions, on, either, side, the, part, of, the, original, island, not, covered, by, the, modern, city, of, tyre, is, mostly, of, an, archaeological, site, showcasing, remains, of, the, city, from, ancient, times, four, municipalities, contribute, to, tyre, city, s, 16, 7, km, 2, built, up, area, though, none, are, included, in, their, entirety, sour, municipality, contains, the, heart, of, the, city, excluding, the, natural, and, coastal, reserve, burj, el, shimali, to, the, east, without, unpopulated, agricultural, lands, abbasiyet, sour, to, the, north, without, agricultural, lands, and, a, dislocated, village, and, ain, baal, to, the, south, east, also, without, agricultural, lands, and, dislocated, villages, tyre, s, urban, area, lies, on, a, fertile, coastal, plain, which, explains, the, fact, that, as, of, 2017, about, 44, of, its, territory, was, used, for, intra, urban, agriculture, while, built, up, land, constituted, over, 40, in, terms, of, geomorphology, and, seismicity, tyre, is, close, to, the, roum, fault, and, the, yammouneh, fault, though, it, has, suffered, a, number, of, devastating, earthquakes, over, the, millennia, the, threat, level, is, considered, to, be, low, in, most, places, and, moderate, in, a, few, others, however, a, tsunami, following, an, earthquake, and, subsequent, landslides, and, floods, pose, major, natural, risks, to, the, tyrian, population, vast, reserves, of, natural, gas, are, estimated, to, lie, beneath, lebanese, waters, much, of, it, off, tyre, s, coast, but, exploitation, has, been, delayed, by, border, disputes, with, israel, early, names, of, tyre, include, akkadian, urru, phoenician, r, and, hebrew, r, in, semitic, languages, the, name, of, the, city, means, rock, after, the, rocky, formation, on, which, the, town, was, originally, built, the, predominant, form, in, classical, greek, was, t, ros, which, was, first, seen, in, the, works, of, herodotus, but, may, have, been, adopted, considerably, earlier, it, gave, rise, to, latin, tyrus, which, entered, english, during, the, middle, english, period, as, tyre, the, demonym, for, tyre, is, tyrian, and, the, inhabitants, are, tyrians, tyre, has, a, hot, summer, mediterranean, climate, classified, as, csa, under, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, characterized, by, six, months, of, drought, from, may, to, october, on, average, it, has, 300, days, of, sun, a, year, and, a, yearly, temperature, of, 20, 8, c, the, average, maximum, temperature, reaches, its, highest, at, 30, 8, c, in, august, and, the, average, minimum, temperature, its, lowest, at, 10, c, in, january, on, average, the, mean, annual, precipitation, reaches, up, to, 645, mm, the, temperature, of, the, sea, water, reaches, a, minimum, of, 17, c, in, february, and, a, maximum, of, 32, c, in, august, at, a, depth, of, 70, m, it, is, constantly, at, 17, 18, c, meanwhile, rising, sea, levels, due, to, global, warming, threaten, coastal, erosion, to, tyre, s, peninsula, and, bay, areas, the, ancient, city, of, tyre, is, located, along, the, coast, of, phoenicia, in, modern, lebanon, the, site, has, been, occupied, since, the, bronze, age, the, city, became, a, prominent, phoenician, city, state, between, the, 9th, and, 6th, centuries, bce, settling, prestigious, colonies, around, the, mediterranean, sea, such, as, carthage, and, leptis, magna, it, went, under, persian, rule, in, 572, bce, before, being, conquered, by, alexander, the, great, in, 332, bce, monumental, archaeological, remains, dated, from, the, subsequent, hellenistic, roman, byzantine, and, medieval, periods, led, to, its, inscription, on, its, archaeological, remains, on, the, unesco, world, s, heritage, list, in, 1984, the, roman, historian, justin, wrote, that, the, original, founders, arrived, from, the, nearby, city, of, sidon, in, the, quest, to, establish, a, new, harbour, the, famous, greek, historian, herodotus, c, 484, 425, bce, born, in, the, city, of, halicarnassus, visited, tyre, around, 450, bce, at, the, end, of, the, greco, persian, wars, 499, 449, bce, and, wrote, in, his, histories, that, according, to, the, priests, there, the, city, was, founded, 2300, years, earlier, around, 2750, bce, as, a, walled, place, upon, the, mainland, now, known, as, paleotyre, old, tyre, the, phoenician, tyrians, international, trade, network, was, based, on, its, two, harbours, which, are, mentioned, by, ancient, writers, arrian, anabasis, 2, 24, strabo, geography, 16, 2, 23, the, northern, harbour, opened, toward, the, phoenician, city, of, sidon, and, has, been, therefore, referred, to, as, the, sidonian, harbour, by, 19th, and, 20th, century, scholars, but, it, was, referred, to, as, the, port, of, astronoe, during, late, antiquity, the, southern, harbour, opened, toward, egypt, and, was, referred, to, as, the, egyptian, harbour, the, location, of, the, two, harbours, has, been, the, subject, of, speculations, since, the, 17th, century, the, submarine, excavation, of, a, large, 4, 6th, century, bce, breakwater, north, of, the, city, and, the, discovery, of, 250, bce, to, 500, ce, harbour, sediments, behind, this, breakwater, demonstrated, the, existence, of, a, northern, harbour, repeatedly, if, not, permanently, throughout, antiquity, under, the, modern, harbour, of, tyre, the, location, of, the, southern, harbour, is, more, elusive, renan, 1864, 1874, envisioned, it, as, an, extensive, structure, now, located, offshore, south, of, the, former, island, subsequent, diving, surveys, identified, submerged, man, made, structures, on, the, seafloor, within, 150, m, of, the, former, island, antoine, poidebard, who, was, the, first, to, have, them, explored, by, divers, in, 1939, saw, in, these, structures, former, breakwaters, enclosing, a, harbour, with, two, entrances, the, geographic, area, enclosed, within, these, structures, is, therefore, often, referred, to, as, the, southern, harbour, these, structures, have, also, been, interpreted, as, a, polder, like, area, protecting, an, urban, district, el, amouri, et, al, 2005, frost, 1971, renan, 1864, 1874, a, phoenician, style, breakwater, was, recently, found, within, this, area, but, excavation, is, needed, to, confirm, its, age, ascription, harbour, sediments, found, behind, the, structure, suggest, that, the, breakwater, was, part, of, the, egyptian, harbour, harbour, sediments, found, near, hiram, s, tower, further, north, mark, an, early, location, of, the, sidonian, harbour, the, development, of, tyre, was, profoundly, affected, by, the, construction, of, a, causeway, built, by, alexander, the, great, in, 332, bce, to, seize, the, city, this, reportedly, 750, m, long, and, 60, m, wide, causeway, was, laid, over, a, submarine, shoal, less, than, 5, 4, m, deep, this, shoal, was, interpreted, as, a, sandbank, also, called, a, salient, formed, by, the, accretion, of, sand, in, the, lee, of, the, island, under, the, effects, of, the, refraction, and, diffraction, of, waves, around, the, island, the, causeway, interrupted, longshore, sand, transport, forcing, sand, to, accumulate, along, the, causeway, rapidly, creating, an, emerged, sandy, isthmus, or, tombolo, linking, the, island, to, the, mainland, this, sandy, isthmus, rapidly, inflated, during, the, centuries, following, the, construction, of, the, causeway, by, early, imperial, roman, times, monumental, buildings, had, been, built, over, most, of, its, surface, their, layout, implies, that, the, isthmus, was, by, then, nearly, as, wide, as, today, therefore, the, isthmus, had, completely, reshaped, the, eastern, coast, of, tyre, island, within, 6, 10, centuries, after, the, construction, of, the, causeway, spurring, a, radical, transformation, of, the, city, tyre, enjoys, a, reputation, of, having, some, of, the, cleanest, beaches, and, waters, of, lebanon, however, a, un, habitat, profile, found, that, seawater, is, also, polluted, due, to, wastewater, discharge, especially, in, the, port, area, there, is, still, also, considerable, pollution, by, solid, waste, the, tyre, coast, nature, reserve, tcnr, was, decreed, in, 1998, by, the, ministry, of, public, works, it, is, 3, 5, km, 2, 2, mi, long, and, covers, over, 380, hectares, 940, acres, the, tcnr, is, within, the, best, preserved, stretch, of, sandy, coastline, in, southern, lebanon, and, divided, into, two, section, zones, a, 1, 8km, sand, lined, beach, 1, 8, km, long, and, 500, meters, wide, ranging, from, the, tyre, rest, house, in, the, north, to, the, rashidieh, refugee, camp, in, the, south, and, a, stretch, of, 2, km, with, agriculture, lands, of, small, family, farms, and, the, springs, of, ras, el, ain, with, three, constantly, flowing, artesian, wells, ranging, from, rashidieh, to, the, village, of, chaetiyeh, in, the, south, the, former, is, divided, into, two, zones, one, for, tourism, that, features, a, public, beach, of, some, 900, m, and, restaurant, tents, during, the, summer, season, hosting, up, to, 20, 000, visitors, on, a, busy, day, and, another, 900, m, of, conservation, zone, as, a, sanctuary, for, sea, turtles, and, migrating, birds, due, to, its, diverse, flora, and, fauna, the, reserve, was, designated, a, ramsar, site, in, 1999, according, to, the, international, treaty, for, the, conservation, and, sustainable, use, of, wetlands, since, it, is, considered, the, last, bio, geographic, ecosystem, in, lebanon, it, is, an, important, nesting, site, for, migratory, birds, the, endangered, loggerhead, and, green, sea, turtle, the, arabian, spiny, mouse, and, many, other, creatures, including, wall, lizards, common, pipistrelle, and, european, badger, also, there, are, frequent, sighting, of, dolphins, in, the, waters, off, tyre, altogether, the, tcnr, includes, 275, species, distributed, over, 50, families, in, addition, the, reserve, is, home, to, seven, regionally, and, nationally, threatened, species, 4, endemic, and, 10, rare, species, whilst, 59, species, are, restricted, to, the, eastern, mediterranean, area, it, is, also, worthy, to, indicate, that, several, bio, indicator, species, as, well, as, 25, medicinal, species, were, recognized, tcnr, encloses, flora, species, belonging, to, the, various, habitats, the, sandy, shore, rocky, shore, littoral, and, freshwater, ecosystems, a, wide, number, of, gramineae, fabaceae, asteraceae, and, umbellifereae, families, dominate, the, floristic, resources, however, the, biodiversity, of, the, tcnr, is, threatened, as, shown, by, a, strong, decrease, in, the, numbers, of, the, caspian, terrapin, mauremys, caspica, the, green, toad, bufo, viridis, and, the, tree, frog, hyla, savigny, also, since, the, 2000s, the, north, american, camphorweed, heterotheca, subaxillaris, has, invaded, the, tcnr, as, a, neophyte, from, haifa, across, the, blue, line, during, the, 2006, war, turtle, breeding, areas, were, affected, when, the, idf, bombed, the, conservation, site, the, oil, spill, which, devastated, the, coast, north, of, ashkelon, in, february, 2021, also, contaminated, tyre, s, beaches, arguably, the, most, lasting, phoenician, legacy, for, the, tyrian, population, has, been, the, linguistic, mark, that, the, syriac, and, akkadian, languages, have, left, on, the, arabic, spoken, in, the, region, of, tyre, most, notably, the, widely, used, term, ba, ali, which, is, used, especially, to, describe, vegetables, and, fruits, from, rain, fed, untreated, agricultural, production, originates, from, the, baal, religion, the, tyrian, municipality, of, ain, baal, is, apparently, also, named, after, the, phoenician, deity, the, most, visible, part, of, ancient, and, medieval, history, on, the, other, side, have, been, the, archaeological, sites, though, the, first, archaeological, excavations, were, by, ernest, renan, in, 1860, and, 1861, he, was, followed, in, the, 1870s, by, johannes, nepemuk, sepp, his, most, notable, work, was, excavating, at, the, cathedral, in, an, attempt, to, find, the, bones, of, frederick, barbarossa, more, work, was, undertaken, in, 1903, by, the, greek, archaeologist, theodore, makridi, curator, of, the, imperial, museum, at, constantinople, important, findings, like, fragments, of, marble, sarcophagi, were, sent, to, the, ottoman, capital, in, 1921, an, archaeological, survey, of, tyre, was, done, by, a, french, team, under, the, leadership, of, denyse, le, lasseur, in, 1921, it, was, followed, by, another, mission, between, 1934, and, 1936, that, included, aerial, surveys, and, diving, expeditions, it, was, led, by, the, jesuit, missionary, antoine, poidebard, a, pioneer, of, aerial, archaeology, large, scale, excavations, started, in, 1946, under, the, leadership, of, emir, maurice, ch, hab, 1904, 1994, the, father, of, modern, lebanese, archaeology, who, for, decades, headed, the, antiquities, service, in, lebanon, and, was, the, curator, of, the, national, museum, of, beirut, his, teams, uncovered, most, remains, in, the, al, bass, hippodrome, and, the, city, site, roman, baths, during, the, 1960s, honor, frost, 1917, 2010, the, cyprus, born, pioneer, of, underwater, archaeology, initiated, several, investigations, aimed, at, identifying, and, documenting, the, significant, archaeological, potential, for, harbour, facilities, within, coastal, tyre, based, on, the, results, she, suggested, that, the, al, mobarakee, tower, may, actually, date, back, to, hellenistic, times, all, those, works, stopped, though, soon, after, the, 1975, beginning, of, the, civil, war, and, many, records, were, lost, in, 1984, the, united, nations, educational, scientific, and, cultural, organisation, unesco, declared, tyre, a, world, heritage, site, in, an, attempt, to, halt, the, damage, being, done, to, the, archaeological, sites, by, the, armed, conflict, and, by, anarchic, urban, development, in, the, late, 1980s, clandestine, excavations, took, place, in, the, al, bass, cemetery, which, flooded, the, antiquities, market, regular, excavation, activities, only, started, again, in, 1995, under, the, supervision, of, ali, khalil, badawi, shortly, afterwards, an, israeli, bomb, destroyed, an, apartment, block, in, the, city, and, evidence, for, an, early, church, was, revealed, underneath, the, rubble, its, unusual, design, suggests, that, this, was, the, site, of, the, cathedral, of, paulinus, which, had, been, inaugurated, in, 315, ce, in, 1997, the, first, phoenician, cremation, cemetery, was, uncovered, in, the, al, bass, site, near, the, roman, necropolis, meanwhile, honor, frost, mentored, local, lebanese, archaeologists, to, conduct, further, underwater, investigations, which, in, 2001, confirmed, the, existence, of, a, human, made, structure, within, the, northern, harbour, area, of, tyre, in, 2003, randa, berri, president, of, the, national, association, for, the, preservation, of, south, lebanon, s, archaeology, and, heritage, and, wife, of, nabih, berri, veteran, leader, of, the, amal, movement, and, longtime, speaker, of, the, parliament, of, lebanon, patronized, a, plan, to, renovate, khan, sour, khan, al, askaar, the, former, ma, ani, palace, and, convert, it, into, a, museum, as, of, 2019, nothing, was, done, in, that, regard, and, the, ruins, have, kept, on, crumbling, the, hostilities, of, the, 2006, lebanon, war, put, the, ancient, structures, of, tyre, at, risk, this, prompted, unesco, s, director, general, to, launch, a, heritage, alert, for, the, site, following, the, cessation, of, hostilities, in, september, 2006, a, visit, by, conservation, experts, to, lebanon, observed, no, direct, damage, to, the, ancient, city, of, tyre, however, the, bombardment, had, damaged, frescoes, in, a, roman, funerary, cave, at, the, tyre, necropolis, additional, site, degradation, was, also, noted, including, the, lack, of, maintenance, the, decay, of, exposed, structures, due, to, lack, of, rainwater, regulation, and, the, decay, of, porous, and, soft, stones, since, 2008, a, lebanese, french, team, under, the, direction, by, pierre, louis, gatier, of, the, university, of, lyon, has, been, conducting, archaeological, and, topographical, work, when, international, archeological, missions, in, syria, came, to, a, halt, after, 2012, due, to, the, war, there, some, of, them, instead, started, excavations, in, tyre, amongst, them, a, team, headed, by, leila, badre, director, of, the, archeological, museum, of, the, american, university, of, beirut, aub, and, belgian, archaeologists, threats, to, tyre, s, ancient, cultural, heritage, include, development, pressures, and, the, illegal, antiquities, trade, a, highway, planned, for, 2011, was, expected, to, be, built, in, areas, that, are, deemed, archaeologically, sensitive, a, small, scale, geophysical, survey, indicated, the, presence, of, archaeological, remains, at, proposed, construction, sites, the, sites, have, not, been, investigated, despite, the, relocation, of, a, proposed, traffic, interchange, the, lack, of, precise, site, boundaries, confuses, the, issue, of, site, preservation, a, 2018, study, of, mediterranean, world, heritage, sites, found, that, tyre, s, city, site, has, the, highest, risk, of, coastal, erosion, under, current, climatic, conditions, in, addition, to, moderate, risk, from, extreme, sea, levels, further, coastal, inspection, was, conducted, in, 2019, leading, to, a, new, hypothesis, about, the, local, relative, sea, level, rise, and, to, discovery, of, yet, unreported, submerged, coastal, structures, like, many, of, the, cities, in, the, levant, and, in, lebanon, the, architecture, since, the, lebanese, civil, war, in, the, 1970s, has, been, of, poor, quality, which, tend, to, threaten, the, cultural, heritage, in, the, built, environment, before, the, war, meanwhile, historical, buildings, from, the, ottoman, period, like, khan, rabu, and, khan, sour, khan, ashkar, have, partly, collapsed, after, decades, of, total, neglect, and, lack, of, any, maintenance, whatsoever, in, 2013, the, international, association, to, save, tyre, iast, made, headlines, when, it, launched, an, online, raffle, in, association, with, sotheby, s, to, fund, the,
