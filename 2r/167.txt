mitanni, c, 1550, 1260, bc, earlier, called, abigalbat, in, old, babylonian, texts, c, 1600, bc, hanigalbat, or, hani, rabbat, in, assyrian, records, or, naharin, in, egyptian, texts, was, a, hurrian, speaking, state, in, northern, syria, and, southeast, anatolia, modern, day, turkey, with, indo, aryan, linguistic, and, political, influences, since, no, histories, royal, annals, or, chronicles, have, yet, been, found, in, its, excavated, sites, knowledge, about, mitanni, is, sparse, compared, to, the, other, powers, in, the, area, and, dependent, on, what, its, neighbours, commented, in, their, texts, the, hurrians, were, in, the, region, as, of, the, late, 3rd, millennium, bc, a, king, of, urkesh, with, a, hurrian, name, tupkish, was, found, on, a, clay, sealing, dated, c, 2300, bc, at, tell, mozan, the, first, recorded, inscription, of, their, language, was, of, tish, atal, c, 21st, century, bc, king, of, urkesh, later, on, hurrians, made, up, the, main, population, of, mitanni, which, was, firstly, known, as, abigalbat, at, babylonia, in, two, texts, of, the, late, old, babylonian, period, during, the, reign, of, ammi, saduqa, c, 1638, 1618, bc, in, low, middle, chronology, the, mitanni, empire, was, a, strong, regional, power, limited, by, the, hittites, to, the, north, egyptians, to, the, west, kassites, to, the, south, and, later, by, the, assyrians, to, the, east, at, its, maximum, extent, mitanni, ranged, as, far, west, as, kizzuwatna, by, the, taurus, mountains, tunip, in, the, south, arraphe, in, the, east, and, north, to, lake, van, their, sphere, of, influence, is, shown, in, hurrian, place, names, personal, names, and, the, spread, through, syria, and, the, levant, of, a, distinct, pottery, type, nuzi, ware, the, earliest, recorded, form, of, the, name, of, this, state, is, maitanni, composed, of, a, hurrian, suffix, nni, added, to, the, indo, aryan, stem, maita, meaning, to, unite, and, comparable, with, the, sanskrit, verb, mith, lit, to, unite, pair, couple, meet, the, name, maitanni, thus, meant, the, united, kingdom, paralleling, the, evolution, of, proto, indo, aryan, m, yt, ati, meaning, lit, he, unites, into, sanskrit, m, thati, the, name, maitanni, evolved, into, the, later, form, mitanni, where, the, stem, maita, had, given, way, to, mita, the, mitanni, kingdom, was, firstly, known, as, abingalbat, before, 1600, bc, in, babylonia, during, the, reign, of, ammi, saduqa, attested, as, a, bi, in, gal, ba, ti, i, and, a, bi, in, ga, al, ba, at, in, two, texts, of, the, late, old, babylonian, period, egyptians, referred, to, it, as, naharin, and, mitanni, it, was, urri, to, the, hittites, and, anigalbat, or, ani, rabbat, to, the, assyrians, these, names, seem, to, have, referred, to, the, same, kingdom, and, were, often, used, interchangeably, according, to, michael, c, astour, hittite, annals, mention, a, people, called, hurri, u, ur, ri, located, in, northeastern, syria, a, hittite, fragment, probably, from, the, time, of, mursili, i, mentions, a, king, of, the, hurri, and, the, assyro, akkadian, version, of, the, text, renders, hurri, as, hanigalbat, tushratta, who, styles, himself, king, of, mitanni, in, his, akkadian, amarna, letters, refers, to, his, kingdom, as, hanigalbat, the, earliest, attestation, of, the, term, anigalbat, can, be, read, in, akkadian, along, with, the, hittite, version, mentioning, the, hurrian, enemy, in, a, copy, from, the, 13th, century, bc, of, the, annals, of, attu, ili, i, who, possibly, reigned, after, 1630, bc, the, reading, of, the, assyrian, term, anigalbat, has, a, history, of, multiple, renderings, the, first, portion, has, been, connected, to, a, nu, hanu, or, hana, first, attested, in, mari, to, describe, nomadic, inhabitants, along, the, southern, shore, of, the, northern, euphrates, region, near, the, vicinity, of, terqa, capital, of, the, kingdom, of, hana, and, the, khabur, river, the, term, developed, into, more, than, just, a, designation, for, a, people, group, but, also, took, on, a, topographic, aspect, as, well, in, the, middle, assyrian, period, a, phrase, uru, kur, a, nu, an, ta, cities, of, the, upper, hanu, has, suggested, that, there, was, a, distinction, between, two, different, hanu, s, likely, across, each, side, of, the, river, this, northern, side, designation, spans, much, of, the, core, territory, of, mitanni, state, the, two, signs, that, have, led, to, variant, readings, are, gal, and, its, alternative, form, gal, 9, the, first, attempts, at, decipherment, in, the, late, 19th, century, rendered, forms, interpreting, gal, meaning, great, in, sumerian, as, a, logogram, for, akkadian, rab, having, the, same, meaning, ani, rabbat, denoting, the, great, hani, j, a, knudtzon, and, e, a, speiser, after, him, supported, instead, the, reading, of, gal, on, the, basis, of, its, alternative, spelling, with, gal, 9, which, has, since, become, the, majority, view, there, is, still, a, difficulty, to, explain, the, suffix, bat, if, the, first, sign, did, not, end, in, b, or, the, apparent, similarity, to, the, semitic, feminine, ending, at, if, derived, from, a, hurrian, word, more, recently, in, 2011, scholar, miguel, val, rio, then, at, the, new, university, of, lisbon, provided, detailed, support, in, favor, of, the, older, reading, hani, rabbat, the, re, reading, makes, an, argument, on, the, basis, of, frequency, where, gal, not, gal, 9, is, far, more, numerous, the, later, being, the, deviation, found, in, six, documents, all, from, the, periphery, of, the, akkadian, sphere, of, influence, it, is, additionally, argued, that, although, they, are, graphically, distinct, there, is, a, high, degree, of, overlap, between, the, two, signs, as, gal, 9, denotes, dannum, or, strong, opposed, to, great, easily, being, used, as, synonyms, both, signs, also, represent, correlative, readings, alternative, readings, of, gal, 9, include, rib, and, rip, just, like, gal, being, read, as, rab, the, situation, is, complicated, by, there, being, according, to, linguists, three, separate, dialects, of, hurrian, central, western, northern, and, eastern, the, egyptians, considered, the, euphrates, river, to, form, the, boundary, between, syria, and, naharain, the, egyptian, official, astronomer, and, clockmaker, amenemhet, amen, hemet, apparently, ordered, to, be, written, on, his,

have, taken, place, in, pharaoh, ahmose, i, s, reign, c, 1550, 1525, bc, actually, by, amenemhet, s, father, during, the, reign, of, pharaoh, thutmose, i, 1506, 1493, bc, the, names, mitanni, and,

reported, that, enemy, of, kadesh, has, come, and, has, entered, into, megiddo, he, is, at, this, moment, he, has, gathered, to, him, the, princes, of, foreign, country, loyal, to, egypt, as, well, as, those, as, far, as, naharin, and, m, them, of, hurru, them, of, kode, their, horses, their, armies, in, several, later, military, campaigns, the, annals, of, thutmose, iii, mention, naharin, in, particular, those, of, his, regnal, years, 33, 35, and, 42, after, that, time, records, become, more, available, from, local, sources, until, the, empire, s, end, in, the, mid, 13th, century, bc, the, first, known, use, of, indo, aryan, names, for, mitanni, rulers, begins, with, shuttarna, i, who, succeeded, his, father, kirta, on, the, throne, king, barattarna, of, mitanni, expanded, the, kingdom, west, to, aleppo, and, made, the, amorite, king, idrimi, of, alalakh, his, vassal, and, five, generations, seems, to, separate, this, king, also, known, as, parattarna, from, the, rise, of, mitanni, kingdom, the, state, of, kizzuwatna, in, the, west, also, shifted, its, allegiance, to, mitanni, and, assyria, in, the, east, had, become, largely, a, mitannian, vassal, state, by, the, mid, 15th, century, bc, the, nation, grew, stronger, during, the, reign, of, shaushtatar, but, the, hurrians, were, keen, to, keep, the, hittites, inside, the, anatolian, highland, kizzuwatna, in, the, west, and, ishuwa, in, the, north, were, important, allies, against, the, hostile, hittites, mitanni, s, major, rival, was, egypt, under, the, thutmosids, however, with, the, ascent, of, the, hittite, empire, mitanni, and, egypt, struck, an, alliance, to, protect, their, mutual, interests, from, the, threat, of, hittite, domination, after, a, few, successful, clashes, with, the, egyptians, over, the, control, of, syria, mitanni, sought, peace, with, them, and, an, alliance, was, formed, during, the, reign, of, shuttarna, ii, in, the, early, 14th, century, bc, the, relationship, was, very, amicable, and, he, sent, his, daughter, gilu, hepa, to, egypt, for, marriage, with, pharaoh, amenhotep, iii, mitanni, was, now, at, its, peak, of, power, however, by, the, reign, of, eriba, adad, i, 1390, 1366, bc, mitanni, influence, over, assyria, was, on, the, wane, eriba, adad, i, became, involved, in, a, dynastic, battle, between, tushratta, and, his, brother, artatama, ii, and, after, this, his, son, shuttarna, ii, who, called, himself, king, of, the, hurri, while, seeking, support, from, the, assyrians, a, pro, hurri, assyria, faction, appeared, at, the, royal, mitanni, court, eriba, adad, i, had, thus, loosened, mitanni, influence, over, assyria, and, in, turn, had, now, made, assyria, an, influence, over, mitanni, affairs, king, ashur, uballit, i, 1365, 1330, bc, of, assyria, attacked, shuttarna, and, annexed, mitanni, territory, in, the, middle, of, the, 14th, century, bc, making, assyria, once, more, a, great, power, at, the, death, of, shuttarna, mitanni, was, ravaged, by, a, war, of, succession, eventually, tushratta, a, son, of, shuttarna, ascended, the, throne, but, the, kingdom, had, been, weakened, considerably, and, both, the, hittite, and, assyrian, threats, increased, at, the, same, time, the, diplomatic, relationship, with, egypt, went, cold, the, egyptians, fearing, the, growing, power, of, the, hittites, and, assyrians, the, hittite, king, suppiluliuma, i, invaded, the, mitanni, vassal, states, in, northern, syria, and, replaced, them, with, loyal, subjects, in, the, capital, washukanni, a, new, power, struggle, broke, out, the, hittites, and, the, assyrians, supported, different, pretenders, to, the, throne, finally, a, hittite, army, conquered, the, capital, washukanni, and, installed, shattiwaza, the, son, of, tushratta, as, their, vassal, king, of, mitanni, in, the, late, 14th, century, bc, the, kingdom, had, by, now, been, reduced, to, the, khabur, valley, the, assyrians, had, not, given, up, their, claim, on, mitanni, and, in, the, 13th, century, bc, shalmaneser, i, annexed, the, kingdom, the, mitanni, dynasty, had, ruled, over, the, northern, euphrates, tigris, region, between, c, 1600, and, 1350, bc, but, succumbed, to, hittite, and, later, assyrian, attacks, and, mitanni, was, reduced, to, the, status, of, a, province, of, the, middle, assyrian, empire, between, c, 1350, and, 1260, bc, as, early, as, akkadian, times, hurrians, are, known, to, have, lived, east, of, the, river, tigris, on, the, northern, rim, of, mesopotamia, and, in, the, khabur, valley, the, group, which, became, mitanni, gradually, moved, south, into, mesopotamia, before, the, 17th, century, bc, it, was, already, a, powerful, kingdom, at, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, or, in, the, first, half, of, the, 16th, century, bc, and, its, beginnings, date, to, well, before, the, time, of, thutmose, i, dating, actually, to, the, time, of, the, hittite, sovereigns, hattusili, i, and, mursili, i, hurrians, are, mentioned, in, the, private, nuzi, texts, in, ugarit, and, the, hittite, archives, in, hattusa, bo, azk, y, cuneiform, texts, from, mari, mention, rulers, of, city, states, in, upper, mesopotamia, with, both, amurru, amorite, and, hurrian, names, rulers, with, hurrian, names, are, also, attested, for, urshum, and, hassum, and, tablets, from, alalakh, layer, vii, from, the, later, part, of, the, old, babylonian, period, mention, people, with, hurrian, names, at, the, mouth, of, the, orontes, there, is, no, evidence, for, any, invasion, from, the, north, east, generally, these, onomastic, sources, have, been, taken, as, evidence, for, a, hurrian, expansion, to, the, south, and, the, west, a, hittite, fragment, probably, from, the, time, of, mursili, i, mentions, a, king, of, the, hurrians, lugal, er, n, me, hurri, this, terminology, was, last, used, for, king, tushratta, of, mitanni, in, a, letter, in, the, amarna, archives, the, normal, title, of, the, king, was, king, of, the, hurri, men, without, the, determinative, kur, indicating, a, country, with, the, final, decline, of, the, mitanni, empire, the, western, portions, of, its, territory, came, under, direct, control, of, the, hittites, and, the, eastern, portions, came, under, direct, control, of, the, assyrians, the, middle, part, continued, on, as, the, rump, state, of, hanigalbat, eventually, under, shalmaneser, i, that, remaining, part, of, the, former, mitanni, territory, came, under, direct, assyrian, control, this, continued, until, the, decline, of, middle, assyrian, power, after, the, death, of, tukulti, ninurta, i, while, under, direct, assyrian, control, hanigalbat, was, ruled, by, appointed, governors, such, as, the, assyrian, grand, vizier, il, pad, father, of, ninurta, apal, ekur, 1191, 1179, who, took, the, title, of, king, of, hanigalbat, he, resided, in, the, newly, built, over, an, existing, mitanni, tower, and, residence, assyrian, administrative, centre, at, tell, sabi, abyad, the, babylonian, kings, list, a, names, the, assyrian, ruler, sennacherib, 705, 681, bc, and, his, son, ashur, nadin, shumi, 700, 694, as, being, dynasty, of, abigal, the, name, hanigalbat, was, still, in, use, as, late, as, the, later, portion, of, the, 1st, millennium, bc, a, number, of, theonyms, proper, names, and, glosses, technical, terminology, of, the, mitanni, are, of, indo, aryan, or, proto, indo, aryan, origins, starting, from, shuttarna, i, who, is, the, first, mitanni, ruler, historically, attested, to, have, existed, the, mitanni, had, indo, aryan, throne, names, the, kikkuli, s, horse, training, text, includes, technical, terms, of, indo, aryan, origin, and, the, indo, aryan, deities, mitra, varuna, indra, and, nasatya, ashvins, are, listed, and, invoked, in, two, treaties, found, in, hattusa, between, the, kings, sattiwaza, of, mitanni, and, uppiluliuma, i, the, hittite, treaty, kbo, i, 3, and, treaty, kbo, i, 1, and, its, duplicates, the, toponym, of, the, mitanni, capital, of, washukanni, is, also, unanimously, accepted, to, have, been, derived, from, an, indo, aryan, dialect, annelies, kammenhuber, 1968, suggested, that, this, vocabulary, was, derived, from, the, still, undivided, indo, iranian, language, but, mayrhofer, has, shown, that, specifically, indo, aryan, features, are, present, it, is, generally, believed, that, indo, aryan, peoples, settled, in, upper, mesopotamia, and, northern, syria, and, established, the, kingdom, of, mitanni, following, a, period, of, political, vacuum, while, also, adopting, hurrian, this, is, considered, a, part, of, the, indo, aryan, migrations, since, the, late, 20th, century, the, view, that, the, mitanni, kingdom, was, ruled, by, royal, house, and, aristocracy, of, indo, aryan, origin, has, been, prevalent, among, the, scholars, accordingly, a, branch, of, indo, aryans, separated, from, the, other, indo, iranians, around, the, turn, of, second, millennium, bce, and, migrated, into, west, asia, hence, giving, rise, to, the, mitanni, kingdom, while, also, adopting, hurrian, language, some, of, the, recent, studies, such, as, those, by, eva, von, dassow, 2022, and, cotticelli, kurras, and, pisaniello, 2023, while, noting, the, modern, identification, of, mittani, as, indo, aryan, and, the, role, of, indo, aryan, speakers, in, establishing, its, dynasty, have, disputed, the, significance, of, indo, aryan, vocabulary, in, an, otherwise, hurrian, speaking, state, stating, that, it, does, not, indicate, any, indo, aryan, origins, for, mitanni, kings, according, to, alexander, lubotsky, 2023, however, the, military, elite, of, the, mitanni, kingdom, see, maryannu, was, of, aryan, descent, and, their, language, displays, a, clear, indo, aryan, character, jasper, eidem, in, 2014, reported, on, farouk, ismail, s, earlier, study, in, reference, to, the, word, marijannu, that, was, found, in, a, letter, from, tell, leilan, in, northeastern, syria, dating, to, a, period, slightly, before, 1761, bc, which, is, the, time, when, the, reign, of, zimri, lim, ended, in, the, region, of, mari, kroonen, et, al, 2018, consider, this, as, an, early, indo, aryan, linguistic, presence, in, syria, two, centuries, prior, to, the, formation, of, the, mitanni, realm, as, mariannu, is, generally, seen, as, a, hurrianized, form, of, the, indo, aryan, marya, which, means, man, or, youth, associated, to, military, affairs, and, chariots, a, concept, known, as, dark, age, was, applied, until, recently, to, the, archaeological, gap, between, the, middle, and, late, bronze, age, on, northern, mesopotamian, sites, but, costanza, coppini, considers, it, a, transition, instead, which, can, be, called, late, bronze, age, 0, attested, from, the, tell, leilan, s, end, caused, by, samsu, iluna, during, his, 23rd, year, of, reign, c, 1728, bce, to, mitanni, s, predominance, c, 1600, 1550, bce, these, are, the, first, traces, of, what, in, the, late, bronze, age, i, was, mitanni, in, historical, terms, at, the, emergence, of, the, third, phase, of, khabur, ware, the, archaeological, core, zone, of, mitanni, is, upper, mesopotamia, and, the, trans, tigridian, region, northeastern, iraq, sites, with, mitannian, remains, were, found, mainly, in, three, regions, of, upper, mesopotamia, northeastern, syria, jazira, region, northern, syria, and, southeastern, turkey, upper, tigris, mitanni, s, first, phase, in, jazira, region, features, late, khabur, ware, from, around, 1600, to, 1550, bc, this, pottery, was, a, continuity, from, the, previous, non, mitannian, old, babylonian, period, from, around, 1550, to, 1270, bc, painted, nuzi, ware, the, most, characteristic, pottery, in, mitanni, times, developed, as, a, contemporary, to, younger, khabur, ware, mitanni, had, outposts, centred, on, its, capital, washukanni, whose, location, has, been, determined, by, archaeologists, to, be, on, the, headwaters, of, the, khabur, river, most, likely, at, the, site, of, tell, fekheriye, as, recent, german, archaeological, excavations, suggest, the, city, of, taite, was, also, known, to, be, a, mitanni, royal, city, whose, current, location, is, unknown, the, major, 3rd, millennium, urban, center, of, tell, brak, which, had, dwindled, to, a, minor, settlement, in, old, babylonian, times, saw, major, development, c, 1600, by, the, mitanni, monumental, buildings, including, a, palace, and, temple, were, constructed, on, the, high, ground, and, a, 40, hectare, lower, town, developed, the, mitanni, occupation, lasted, until, the, site, was, destroyed, in, two, phases, between, c, 1300, and, 1275, bc, presumably, by, the, assyrians, two, mitanni, era, tablets, were, found, during, the, modern, excavation, one, tb, 6002, mentioned, artassumara, the, king, son, of, shuttarna, the, king, seventeen, late, period, mitanni, tablets, were, found, at, tall, al, hamidiya, the, oldest, tablet, issued, by, an, unknown, mitannian, king, was, found, in, the, site, of, tell, hammam, et, turkman, dated, to, c, 1500, bce, mitanni, period, occupation, between, 1400, and, 1200, bc, radiocarbon, was, found, at, the, site, of, tell, bazi, finds, included, a, mitanni, cylinder, seal, and, several, ritual, bowls, two, cuneiform, tablets, of, the, mitanni, period, sealed, by, mitanni, ruler, saushtatar, one, by, artatama, i, were, also, found, there, is, also, a, record, of, mitanni, governance, at, tell, hadidi, azu, the, 2017, salvage, excavations, at, the, il, su, dam, in, the, right, bank, of, upper, tigris, southern, turkey, have, shown, a, very, early, beginning, of, mitanni, period, as, in, the, ruins, of, a, temple, in, m, sl, mantepe, ritual, artefacts, and, a, mitannian, cylinder, seal, were, found, radiocarbon, dated, to, 1760, 1610, bc, archaeologist, eyy, p, ay, in, his, 2021, paper, describes, the, second, phase, of, the, temple, as, an, administrative, center, which, had, craftsmen, working, in, its, workshops, as, well, as, farmers, gardeners, and, shepherds, might, have, been, ruled, by, a, priest, bound, to, a, powerful, mitannian, leader, to, the, east, of, upper, tigris, river, trans, tigridian, region, in, northern, iraq, a, site, now, called, bassetki, was, excavated, which, in, all, likelihood, was, the, ancient, town, of, mardama, with, mitanni, layers, from, 1550, to, 1300, bc, as, its, phase, a9, in, trench, t2, may, alternatively, represent, a, middle, bronze, late, bronze, transitional, or, proto, mitanni, occupation, within, 16th, century, bc, in, a, subsequent, excavation, season, the, deeper, phase, a10, was, identified, as, having, a, mix, of, middle, bronze, and, mitanni, potteries, considered, to, be, in, the, turn, of, the, middle, to, the, late, bronze, age, transitional, period, late, 17th, early, 16th, century, bc, in, 2010, the, 3, 400, year, old, ruins, of, kemune, a, bronze, age, mitanni, palace, on, the, banks, of, the, tigris, in, modern, day, iraqi, kurdistan, were, discovered, it, became, possible, to, excavate, the, ruins, in, 2018, and, again, in, 2022, when, a, drought, caused, water, levels, to, drop, considerably, in, the, 1st, excavation, 10, mitanni, era, tablets, were, found, in, babylonian, cuneiform, written, in, akkadian, bearing, hurrian, names, dating, to, the, middle, trans, tigridian, ia, and, ib, periods, middle, trans, tigridian, ia, and, ib, are, dated, to, c, 1550, 1350, bc, and, c, 1350, 1270, bc, respectively, by, peter, pf, lzner, 2007, in, the, 2nd, excavation, the, entire, city, was, mapped, and, 100, middle, assyrian, tablets, were, discovered, they, were, dated, to, after, the, city, s, destruction, by, earthquake, and, have, not, yet, been, published, at, least, since, around, 1550, bc, at, the, beginning, of, late, bronze, age, painted, nuzi, ware, was, identified, as, a, characteristic, pottery, in, mitanni, sites, the, origin, of, this, decorated, pottery, is, an, unsolved, question, but, a, possible, previous, development, as, aegean, kamares, ware, has, been, suggested, by, pecorelia, 2000, s, soldi, claims, that, tell, brak, was, one, of, the, first, centers, specializing, in, the, production, of, this, painted, nuzi, ware, and, analyses, on, samples, support, the, assumption, that, it, was, produced, locally, in, various, centers, throughout, the, mitanni, kingdom, it, was, particularly, appreciated, in, upper, mesopotamia, but, appears, only, sporadically, in, western, syrian, cities, such, as, alalakh, and, ugarit, at, the, height, of, its, power, during, the, 15th, and, the, first, half, of, 14th, century, bc, a, large, region, from, north, west, syria, to, the, eastern, tigris, was, under, mitanni, s, control, mitanni, which, first, rose, to, power, before, 1550, bc, presents, the, following, known, kings, all, dates, must, be, taken, with, caution, since, they, are, worked, out, only, by, comparison, with, the, chronology, of, other, ancient, near, eastern, nations, king, barattarna, is, known, from, a, cuneiform, tablet, in, nuzi, and, an, inscription, by, idrimi, of, alalakh, he, reigned, c, 1500, 1480, bc, egyptian, sources, do, not, mention, his, name, that, he, was, the, king, of, naharin, whom, thutmose, iii, 1479, 1425, bc, fought, against, can, only, be, deduced, from, assumptions, this, king, also, known, as, parratarna, is, considered, by, j, a, belmonte, marin, quoting, h, klengel, to, have, reigned, c, 1510, 1490, bc, middle, chronology, parsha, ta, tar, known, from, another, nuzi, inscription, hss, 13, 165, an, undated, inventory, list, which, mentions, his, death, is, considered, a, different, king, than, barattarna, by, m, p, maidman, eva, von, dassow, and, ian, mladjov, thutmose, iii, again, waged, war, in, mitanni, in, the, 33rd, year, of, his, rule, the, egyptian, army, crossed, the, euphrates, at, carchemish, and, reached, a, town, called, iryn, maybe, present, day, erin, 20, km, northwest, of, aleppo, they, sailed, down, the, euphrates, to, emar, maskanah, and, then, returned, home, via, mitanni, a, hunt, for, elephants, at, lake, nija, was, important, enough, to, be, included, in, the, annals, victories, over, mitanni, are, recorded, from, the, egyptian, campaigns, in, nuha, e, middle, part, of, syria, barattarna, or, his, son, shaushtatar, controlled, the, north, mitanni, interior, up, to, nuha, e, and, the, coastal, territories, from, kizzuwatna, to, alalakh, in, the, kingdom, of, mukish, at, the, mouth, of, the, orontes, idrimi, of, alalakh, returning, from, egyptian, exile, could, only, ascend, his, throne, with, barattarna, s, consent, while, he, got, to, rule, mukish, and, ama, u, aleppo, remained, with, mitanni, shaushtatar, reigned, as, king, of, mitanni, c, 1480, 1460, bc, he, sacked, the, assyrian, capital, of, assur, some, time, in, the, 15th, century, during, the, reign, of, nur, ili, and, took, the, silver, and, golden, doors, of, the, royal, palace, to, washukanni, this, is, known, from, a, later, hittite, document, the, suppililiuma, shattiwaza, treaty, after, the, sack, of, assur, assyria, may, have, paid, tribute, to, mitanni, up, to, the, time, of, eriba, adad, i, 1390, 1366, bc, the, states, of, aleppo, in, the, west, and, nuzi, and, arrapha, in, the, east, seem, to, have, been, incorporated, into, mitanni, under, shaushtatar, as, well, a, letter, hss, 9, 1, sealed, with, the, seal, of, shaushtatar, was, discovered, in, the, house, room, a26, of, prince, ilwa, te, up, in, nuzi, which, lay, just, north, of, the, main, mound, the, letter, is, addressed, to, ithia, vassal, ruler, of, arrapha, under, mitanni, because, au, tatar, is, not, mentioned, in, the, letter, and, dynastic, seals, were, often, used, after, the, reign, of, a, ruler, especially, in, the, periphery, of, empire, it, is, difficult, to, date, this, letter, stein, based, on, various, factors, puts, the, date, at, c, 1400, bc, his, seal, shows, heroes, and, winged, geniuses, fighting, lions, and, other, animals, as, well, as, a, winged, sun, this, style, with, a, multitude, of, figures, distributed, over, the, whole, of, the, available, space, is, taken, as, typically, hurrian, a, second, seal, belonging, to, shuttarna, i, and, found, in, alalakh, used, by, shaushtatar, in, two, letters, at, 13, and, 14, shows, a, more, traditional, post, akkadian, ur, iii, style, during, the, reign, of, egyptian, pharaoh, amenhotep, ii, mitanni, seems, to, have, regained, influence, in, the, middle, orontes, valley, that, had, been, conquered, by, thutmose, iii, amenhotep, ii, fought, in, syria, in, 1425, bc, presumably, against, mitanni, as, well, but, did, not, reach, the, euphrates, later, on, egypt, and, mitanni, became, allies, and, king, shuttarna, ii, himself, was, received, at, the, egyptian, court, amicable, letters, sumptuous, gifts, and, letters, asking, for, sumptuous, gifts, were, exchanged, three, amarna, letters, ea, 182, ea, 183, and, ea, 185, were, sent, by, shutarna, with, two, being, sent, from, mu, i, una, mitanni, was, especially, interested, in, egyptian, gold, this, culminated, in, a, number, of, royal, marriages, the, daughter, of, king, artatama, i, was, married, to, thutmose, iv, kilu, hepa, or, gilukhipa, the, daughter, of, shuttarna, ii, was, married, to, pharaoh, amenhotep, iii, who, ruled, in, the, early, 14th, century, bc, in, a, later, royal, marriage, tadu, hepa, or, tadukhipa, the, daughter, of, tushratta, was, sent, to, egypt, when, amenhotep, iii, fell, ill, the, king, of, mitanni, sent, him, a, statue, of, the, goddess, shaushka, ishtar, of, nineveh, that, was, reputed, to, cure, diseases, a, more, or, less, permanent, border, between, egypt, and, mitanni, seems, to, have, existed, near, qatna, on, the, orontes, river, ugarit, was, part, of, egyptian, territory, the, reason, mitanni, sought, peace, with, egypt, may, have, been, trouble, with, the, hittites, a, hittite, king, called, tud, aliya, i, conducted, campaigns, against, kizzuwatna, arzawa, ishuwa, aleppo, and, maybe, against, mitanni, itself, kizzuwatna, may, have, fallen, to, the, hittites, at, that, time, arta, umara, reigned, c, 1360, 1358, bc, is, known, only, from, a, single, mention, in, a, tablet, found, in, tell, brak, artassumara, the, king, son, of, shuttarna, the, king, and, a, mention, in, amarna, letter, 17, according, to, the, later, after, the, death, of, shuttarna, ii, he, briefly, took, power, but, was, then, murdered, by, someone, named, tuhi, and, succeeded, by, his, brother, tushratta, who, reigned, c, 1358, 1335, bc, knowledge, of, tushratta, comes, from, two, sources, the, amarna, letters, and, the, texts, of, the, suppiluliuma, shattiwaza, treaties, between, hittite, ruler, suppiluliuma, i, and, a, son, of, tushratta, named, shattiwaza, these, pair, of, treaties, found, at, the, ancient, hittite, capital, of, hattusa, codify, the, mitanni, shattiwaza, probable, son, of, tushratta, entering, the, status, of, vassal, to, suppiluliuma, i, one, cth, 51, also, known, as, kbo, i, 1, includes, a, historical, prologue, from, the, hittite, point, of, view, which, is, complete, this, tablet, also, confirms, that, the, existing, hittite, treaty, with, artatama, ii, is, still, in, effect, so, perhaps, suppiluliuma, was, hedging, his, bets, the, other, cth, 52, includes, a, historical, prologue, from, the, mitanni, point, of, view, which, is, partially, lost, though, another, fragment, to, this, tablet, was, found, in, recent, years, these, prologues, provide, information, about, the, events, of, the, time, of, tushratta, but, must, be, considered, under, the, self, interest, of, the, two, treaty, parties, while, the, preambles, of, the, treaties, are, a, later, retrospective, and, are, filtered, through, the, interests, of, the, treaty, parties, the, tablets, found, in, egypt, provide, direct, information, eight, amarna, letters, were, sent, to, pharaoh, amenhotep, iii, including, ea, 19, and, ea, 23, and, four, to, pharaoh, akhenaten, including, ea, 27, a, single, amarna, letter, was, sent, by, tushratta, to, queen, tiye, wife, of, amenhotep, iii, mother, of, akhenaten, and, grandmother, of, tutankhamun, ea, 26, a, note, in, hieratic, on, the, tablet, stated, that, ea, 23, arrived, in, the, 36th, year, of, amenhotep, iii, reign, or, roughly, 1350, bc, in, the, standard, egyptian, chronology, some, of, the, amarna, letters, covered, minor, matters, between, tushratta, and, the, pharaohs, amenhotep, iii, asked, for, tushratta, s, daughter, tadukhipa, in, marriage, and, after, some, back, and, forth, over, bride, price, she, traveled, to, egypt, and, became, a, wife, of, the, pharaoh, and, when, that, pharaoh, was, ill, near, the, end, of, his, reign, tushratta, sent, ea, 23, the, hurrian, goddess, au, ka, of, nineveh, actually, her, cult, statue, to, him, as, had, been, done, in, the, time, of, shuttarna, ii, the, main, focus, of, the, amarna, letters, though, was, a, consequence, of, the, realignment, of, power, in, syria, with, the, decline, of, egyptian, influence, and, rise, of, hittite, power, with, a, number, of, lesser, powers, caught, in, the, middle, in, the, first, letter, from, tusratta, he, claimed, to, have, destroyed, the, hittite, forces, that, had, invaded, his, territory, and, included, a, selection, of, the, booty, including, a, chariot, and, several, slaves, in, later, letters, we, see, the, hittite, ruler, working, to, improve, previously, poor, relations, with, the, pharaoh, so, as, to, counterbalance, mitanni, according, to, other, amarna, letters, ea, 85, ea86, ea95, from, rib, hadda, king, of, byblos, tushratta, personally, joined, a, large, mitanni, raid, into, amurru, in, another, amarna, letter, ea, 75, rib, hadda, tells, ahkenaten, that, all, the, lands, of, the, mitanni, have, been, conquered, by, the, hittites, but, its, date, is, uncertain, the, suppiluliuma, shattiwaza, treaty, says, when, with, the, sun, shubbiluliuma, the, great, valiant, the, king, of, hatti, the, beloved, of, teshub, artatama, king, of, harri, made, a, treaty, and, thereafter, tushratta, king, of, mitanni, exalted, him, the, king, of, hatti, the, valiant, exalted, myself, against, tushratta, the, king, of, lands, on, this, side, of, the, river, i, plundered, and, mount, niblani, i, restored, to, my, domain, when, his, son, waxed, strong, with, his, servants, he, slew, his, father, tushratta, the, king, and, when, tushratta, the, king, died, teshub, gave, a, decision, in, favor, of, artatama, and, his, son, artatama, he, spared, but, the, harri, people, had, become, discontented, and, shutatarra, with, the, marianni, tried, to, kill, mattiuaza, the, prince, he, escaped, and, before, the, sun, shubbiluliuma, he, came, the, great, king, spoke, thus, teshub, has, rendered, a, decision, in, his, favor, whereupon, i, took, mattiuaza, son, of, tushratta, the, king, into, my, hand, and, placed, him, on, the, throne, of, his, father, tusratta, faced, a, difficult, situation, an, ascendant, hittite, new, kingdom, in, the, west, and, in, the, east, an, assyrian, power, beginning, to, free, itself, of, mitanni, control, at, the, start, of, the, middle, assyrian, period, a, rule, book, ended, by, succession, crises, with, no, mitanni, or, assyrian, records, we, are, left, with, the, historical, claims, of, the, hittite, king, for, better, or, worse, in, summary, they, are, shattiwaza, reigned, c, 1330, 1305, bc, alternately, attiwaza, kurtiwaza, or, mattiwaza, what, little, is, known, about, his, period, like, the, later, parts, of, the, reign, of, his, father, tushratta, all, comes, from, the, partially, recovered, pair, of, hittite, texts, in, which, shattiwaza, becomes, a, vassal, of, hittite, king, suppiluliuma, i, the, first, text, cth, 51, lays, out, the, condition, of, vassalage, and, in, the, second, cth, 52, shattiwaza, accepts, these, conditions, the, text, can, be, difficult, to, interpret, because, of, gaps, and, the, obtuse, prose, the, suppiluliuma, shattiwaza, treaty, reads, i, mattiuaza, son, of, tushratta, king, of, mitanni, handed, over, to, shuttarna, of, mitanni, artatama, the, king, his, father, did, what, was, not, right, his, palace, together, with, his, possessions, he, wasted, to, give, them, to, assyria, and, alshe, he, wasted, them, tushratta, the, king, my, father, built, a, palace, filled, it, with, treasures, but, shuttarna, destroyed, it, he, overthrew, it, the, best, that, can, be, parsed, out, of, the, hittite, text, is, that, some, unnamed, son, killed, the, prior, king, tushratta, resulting, in, a, succession, crisis, between, atratama, ii, brother, of, tushratta, shuttarna, iii, son, of, tusratta, and, shattiwaza, son, of, tushratta, the, hittites, then, made, a, treaty, with, atratama, ii, still, in, effect, as, of, the, suppiluliuma, shattiwaza, treaty, some, combination, of, atratama, ii, and, shuttarna, iii, made, an, alliance, with, the, assyrians, to, hold, power, in, mitanni, returning, cultic, items, taken, when, mitanni, king, shaushtatar, sacked, asshur, c, 1450, this, resulted, in, shattiwaza, going, to, hittite, king, suppiluliuma, and, declaring, vassalage, in, exchange, for, hittite, military, assistance, this, ploy, succeeded, as, the, hittite, forces, carried, the, day, but, the, cost, besides, becoming, a, vassal, was, the, ceding, of, some, mitanni, territory, to, the, hittites, subsequently, ruled, by, the, king, s, son, piyassili, as, king, of, carchemesh, as, part, of, the, agreement, shattiwaza, would, marry, a, daughter, of, suppiluliuma, as, queen, and, would, be, allowed, ten, wives, but, none, of, the, other, wives, could, be, primary, and, the, children, from, his, marriage, with, the, queen, would, succeed, the, hittite, text, does, include, some, tidbits, about, the, war, of, succession, which, are, hard, to, interpret, at, one, point, the, hurrian, nobles, were, taken, to, taite, and, crucified, though, that, practice, was, unknown, in, the, ancient, near, east, until, classical, times, and, at, one, point, shattiwaza, flees, to, the, kassites, with, 200, chariots, but, the, kassites, impounded, the, chariots, and, tried, to, kill, him, which, he, mirsculously, escapes, and, finds, his, way, to, suppiluliuma, after, presumably, ascending, the, throne, of, what, was, left, of, mitanni, shattiwaza, is, lost, to, history, shattuara, reigned, c, 1305, 1285, bc, the, royal, inscriptions, of, the, assyrian, king, adad, nirari, i, c, 1307, 1275, bc, relate, how, the, vassal, king, shattuara, of, mitanni, rebelled, and, committed, hostile, acts, against, assyria, how, this, shattuara, was, related, to, the, dynasty, of, partatama, is, unclear, some, scholars, think, that, he, was, the, second, son, of, artatama, ii, and, the, brother, of, shattiwazza, s, one, time, rival, shuttarna, adad, nirari, claims, to, have, captured, king, shattuara, and, brought, him, to, ashur, where, he, took, an, oath, as, a, vassal, afterwards, he, was, allowed, to, return, to, mitanni, where, he, paid, adad, nirari, regular, tribute, this, must, have, happened, during, the, reign, of, the, hittite, king, mursili, ii, but, there, is, no, exact, date, according, to, an, inscription, bm, 115687, by, assyrian, king, adad, nirari, i, shattuara, s, son, wasashatta, also, read, uasa, atta, who, reigned, c, 1285, 1265, bc, attempted, to, rebel, he, sought, hittite, help, which, did, not, come, the, hittites, took, wasashatta, s, money, but, did, not, help, the, assyrians, expanded, further, and, conquered, the, royal, city, of, taidu, and, took, washukanni, amasakku, kahat, shuru, nabula, hurra, and, shuduhu, as, well, they, conquered, irridu, destroyed, it, utterly, and, sowed, salt, over, it, the, wife, sons, and, daughters, of, wasashatta, were, taken, to, ashur, together, with, much, booty, and, other, prisoners, as, wasashatta, himself, is, not, mentioned, he, may, have, escaped, capture, there, is, a, letter, kbo, 1, 14, from, a, hittite, king, to,
