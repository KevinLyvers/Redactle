people, intermingled, with, the, colonizers, to, create, a, uniquely, iberian, culture, the, romans, referred, to, the, entire, peninsula, as, hispania, from, which, the, name, spain, originates, as, was, the, rest, of, the, western, roman, empire, spain, was, subject, to, the, numerous, invasions, of, germanic, tribes, during, the, 4th, and, 5th, centuries, ad, resulting, in, the, end, of, roman, rule, and, the, establishment, of, germanic, kingdoms, marking, the, beginning, of, the, middle, ages, in, spain, germanic, control, lasted, about, 200, years, until, the, umayyad, conquest, of, hispania, began, in, 711, the, region, became, known, as, al, andalus, and, except, for, the, small, kingdom, of, asturias, the, region, remained, under, the, control, of, muslim, led, states, for, much, of, the, early, middle, ages, a, period, known, as, the, islamic, golden, age, by, the, time, of, the, high, middle, ages, christians, from, the, north, gradually, expanded, their, control,

during, the, early, middle, ages, although, the, institutions, and, infrastructure, did, decline, spain, s, languages, its, religion, and, the, basis, of, its, laws, originate, from, this, period,

kingdom, in, toledo, the, romanized, visigoths, entered, hispania, in, 415, after, the, conversion, of, their, monarchy, to, roman, catholicism, and, after, conquering, the, disordered, suebic, territories, in, the, northwest, and, byzantine, territories, in, the, southeast, the, visigothic, kingdom, eventually, encompassed, a, great, part, of, the, peninsula, as, rome, declined, germanic, tribes, invaded, the, former, empire, some, were, foederati, tribes, enlisted, to, serve, in, roman, armies, and, given, land, as, payment, while, others, such, as, the, vandals, took, advantage, of, the, empire, s, weakening, defenses, to, plunder, those, tribes, that, survived, took, over, existing, roman, institutions, and, created, successor, kingdoms, to, the, romans, in, various, parts, of, europe, hispania, was, taken, over, by, the, visigoths, after, 410, at, the, same, time, there, was, a, process, of, romanization, of, the, germanic, and, hunnic, tribes, the, visigoths, for, example, were, converted, to, arian, christianity, around, 360, even, before, they, were, pushed, into, imperial, territory, by, the, expansion, of, the, huns, the, visigoths, having, sacked, rome, two, years, earlier, arrived, in, gaul, in, 412, founding, the, visigothic, kingdom, of, toulouse, in, the, south, of, modern, france, and, gradually, expanded, their, influence, into, hispania, after, the, battle, of, vouill, 507, at, the, expense, of, the, vandals, and, alans, who, moved, on, into, north, africa, without, leaving, much, permanent, mark, on, hispanic, culture, the, visigothic, kingdom, shifted, its, capital, to, toledo, and, reached, a, high, point, during, the, reign, of, leovigild, the, visigothic, kingdom, conquered, all, of, hispania, and, ruled, it, until, the, early, 8th, century, when, the, peninsula, fell, to, the, muslim, conquests, the, muslim, state, in, hispania, came, to, be, known, as, al, andalus, after, a, period, of, muslim, dominance, the, medieval, history, of, spain, is, dominated, by, the, long, christian, reconquista, or, reconquest, of, the, iberian, peninsula, the, reconquista, gathered, momentum, during, the, 12th, century, leading, to, the, establishment, of, the, christian, kingdoms, of, portugal, aragon, castile, and, navarre, and, by, 1250, had, reduced, muslim, control, to, the, emirate, of, granada, in, the, south, east, muslim, rule, in, granada, survived, until, 1492, when, it, fell, to, the, catholic, monarchs, hispania, never, saw, a, decline, in, interest, in, classical, culture, to, the, degree, observable, in, britain, gaul, and, germany, the, visigoths, having, assimilated, roman, culture, and, language, during, their, tenure, as, foederati, maintained, more, of, the, old, roman, institutions, they, had, a, unique, respect, for, legal, codes, that, resulted, in, continuous, frameworks, and, historical, records, for, most, of, the, period, between, 415, when, visigothic, rule, in, hispania, began, and, 711, when, it, is, traditionally, said, to, end, the, liber, iudiciorum, or, lex, visigothorum, 654, also, known, as, the, book, of, judges, which, recceswinth, promulgated, based, on, roman, law, and, germanic, customary, laws, brought, about, legal, unification, according, to, the, historian, joseph, o, callaghan, at, that, time, they, already, considered, themselves, one, people, and, together, with, the, hispano, gothic, nobility, they, called, themselves, the, gens, gothorum, in, the, early, middle, ages, the, liber, iudiciorum, was, known, as, the, visigothic, code, and, also, as, the, fuero, juzgo, its, influence, on, law, extends, to, the, present, the, proximity, of, the, visigothic, kingdoms, to, the, mediterranean, and, the, continuity, though, reduced, of, western, mediterranean, trade, supported, visigothic, culture, the, visigothic, ruling, class, looked, to, constantinople, for, style, and, technology, spanish, catholicism, also, coalesced, during, this, time, the, period, of, rule, by, the, visigothic, kingdom, saw, the, spread, of, arianism, briefly, in, hispania, the, councils, of, toledo, debated, creed, and, liturgy, in, orthodox, catholicism, and, the, council, of, lerida, in, 546, constrained, the, clergy, and, extended, the, power, of, law, over, them, with, the, approval, of, the, pope, in, 587, the, visigothic, king, at, toledo, reccared, converted, to, catholicism, and, launched, a, movement, to, unify, the, various, religious, doctrines, in, hispania, the, visigoths, inherited, from, late, antiquity, a, prefeudal, system, in, hispania, based, in, the, south, on, the, roman, villa, system, and, in, the, north, drawing, on, their, vassals, to, supply, troops, in, exchange, for, protection, the, bulk, of, the, visigothic, army, was, composed, of, slaves, the, loose, council, of, nobles, that, advised, hispania, s, visigothic, kings, and, legitimized, their, rule, was, responsible, for, raising, the, army, and, only, upon, its, consent, was, the, king, able, to, summon, soldiers, the, economy, of, the, visigothic, kingdom, depended, primarily, on, agriculture, and, animal, husbandry, there, is, little, evidence, of, visigothic, commerce, and, industry, the, native, hispani, maintained, the, cultural, and, economic, life, of, hispania, and, were, responsible, for, the, relative, prosperity, of, the, 6th, and, 7th, centuries, administration, was, still, based, on, roman, law, and, only, gradually, did, visigothic, customs, and, roman, common, law, merge, the, visigoths, did, not, until, the, period, of, muslim, rule, intermarry, with, the, spanish, population, and, the, visigothic, language, had, a, limited, impact, on, the, modern, languages, of, iberia, the, historian, joseph, f, o, callaghan, says, that, at, the, end, of, the, visigothic, era, the, assimilation, of, hispano, romans, and, visigoths, was, occurring, rapidly, and, the, leaders, of, society, were, beginning, to, see, themselves, as, one, people, little, literature, in, the, gothic, language, remains, from, the, period, of, visigothic, rule, only, translations, of, parts, of, the, greek, bible, and, a, few, fragments, of, other, documents, have, survived, the, hispano, romans, found, visigothic, rule, and, its, early, embrace, of, the, arian, heresy, more, of, a, threat, than, islam, and, shed, their, thralldom, to, the, visigoths, only, in, the, 8th, century, with, the, aid, of, the, muslims, themselves, the, most, visible, effect, of, visigothic, rule, was, the, depopulation, of, the, cities, as, their, inhabitants, moved, to, the, countryside, even, while, the, country, enjoyed, a, degree, of, prosperity, when, compared, to, france, and, germany, the, visigoths, felt, little, reason, to, contribute, to, the, welfare, permanency, and, infrastructure, of, their, people, and, state, this, contributed, to, their, downfall, as, they, could, not, count, on, the, loyalty, of, their, subjects, when, the, moors, arrived, in, the, 8th, century, in, spain, an, important, collection, of, visigothic, metalwork, was, found, in, guadamur, known, as, the, treasure, of, guarrazar, this, archeological, find, comprises, twenty, six, votive, crowns, and, gold, crosses, from, the, royal, workshop, in, toledo, with, signs, of, byzantine, influence, during, their, governance, of, hispania, the, visigoths, built, several, churches, in, the, basilical, or, cruciform, style, that, survive, including, the, churches, of, san, pedro, de, la, nave, in, el, campillo, santa, mar, a, de, melque, in, san, mart, n, de, montalb, n, santa, luc, a, del, trampal, in, alcu, scar, santa, comba, in, bande, and, santa, mar, a, de, lara, in, quintanilla, de, las, vi, as, the, visigothic, crypt, the, crypt, of, san, antol, n, in, the, palencia, cathedral, is, a, visigothic, chapel, from, the, mid, 7th, century, built, during, the, reign, of, wamba, to, preserve, the, remains, of, the, martyr, saint, antoninus, of, pamiers, these, are, the, only, remains, of, the, visigothic, cathedral, of, palencia, reccopolis, located, near, the, tiny, modern, village, of, zorita, de, los, canes, is, an, archaeological, site, of, one, of, at, least, four, cities, founded, in, hispania, by, the, visigoths, it, is, the, only, city, in, western, europe, to, have, been, founded, between, the, fifth, and, eighth, centuries, the, city, s, construction, was, ordered, by, the, visigothic, king, liuvigild, to, honor, his, son, reccared, and, to, serve, as, reccared, s, seat, as, co, king, in, the, visigothic, province, of, celtiberia, at, the, beginning, of, the, visigothic, kingdom, arianism, was, the, official, religion, in, hispania, but, only, for, a, brief, time, according, to, historian, rhea, marsh, smith, in, 587, reccared, the, visigothic, king, at, toledo, converted, to, catholicism, and, launched, a, movement, to, unify, the, religious, doctrines, that, existed, in, the, iberian, peninsula, the, councils, of, toledo, debated, the, creed, and, liturgy, of, orthodox, catholicism, and, the, council, of, lerida, in, 546, constrained, the, clergy, and, extended, the, power, of, law, over, them, with, the, approval, of, the, pope, while, the, visigoths, clung, to, their, arian, faith, the, jews, were, well, tolerated, previous, roman, and, byzantine, law, determined, their, status, and, already, sharply, discriminated, against, them, historian, jane, gerber, relates, that, some, of, the, jews, held, ranking, posts, in, the, government, or, the, army, others, were, recruited, and, organized, for, garrison, service, still, others, continued, to, hold, senatorial, rank, in, general, they, were, well, respected, and, well, treated, by, the, visigothic, kings, until, their, transition, from, arianism, to, catholicism, conversion, to, catholicism, across, visigothic, society, reduced, the, friction, between, the, visigoths, and, the, hispano, roman, population, however, the, visigothic, conversion, negatively, impacted, the, jews, who, came, under, scrutiny, for, their, religious, practices, the, umayyad, caliphate, dominated, most, of, north, africa, by, 710, ad, in, 711, an, islamic, berber, conquering, party, led, by, tariq, ibn, ziyad, was, sent, to, hispania, to, intervene, in, a, civil, war, in, the, visigothic, kingdom, crossing, the, strait, of, gibraltar, they, won, a, decisive, victory, in, the, summer, of, 711, when, the, visigothic, king, roderic, was, defeated, and, killed, on, july, 19, at, the, battle, of, guadalete, tariq, s, commander, musa, quickly, crossed, with, arab, reinforcements, and, by, 718, the, muslims, were, in, control, of, nearly, the, whole, iberian, peninsula, the, advance, into, western, europe, was, only, stopped, in, what, is, now, north, central, france, by, the, west, germanic, franks, under, charles, martel, at, the, battle, of, tours, in, 732, the, muslim, conquerors, also, known, as, moors, were, arabs, and, berbers, following, the, conquest, conversion, and, arabization, of, the, hispano, roman, population, took, place, muwalladum, or, muwallad, after, a, long, process, spurred, on, in, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, the, majority, of, the, population, in, al, andalus, converted, to, islam, the, muslim, population, was, divided, per, ethnicity, arabs, berbers, muwallad, and, the, supremacy, of, arabs, over, the, rest, of, group, was, a, recurrent, cause, for, strife, rivalry, and, hatred, particularly, between, arabs, and, berbers, arab, elites, could, be, further, divided, in, the, yemenites, first, wave, and, syrians, second, wave, male, muslim, rulers, were, often, the, offspring, of, female, christian, slaves, christians, and, jews, were, allowed, to, live, as, subordinate, groups, of, a, stratified, society, under, the, dhimmah, system, although, jews, became, very, important, in, certain, fields, some, christians, migrated, to, the, northern, christian, kingdoms, while, those, who, stayed, in, al, andalus, progressively, arabised, and, became, known, as, musta, arab, mozarabs, besides, slaves, of, iberian, origin, the, slave, population, also, comprised, the, aq, liba, literally, meaning, slavs, although, they, were, slaves, of, generic, european, origin, as, well, as, sudanese, slaves, the, frequent, raids, in, christian, lands, provided, al, andalus, with, continuous, slave, stock, including, women, who, often, became, part, of, the, harems, of, the, muslim, elite, slaves, were, also, shipped, from, spain, to, elsewhere, in, the, ummah, in, what, should, not, have, amounted, to, much, more, than, a, skirmish, later, magnified, by, spanish, nationalism, a, muslim, force, sent, to, put, down, the, christian, rebels, in, the, northern, mountains, was, defeated, by, a, force, reportedly, led, by, pelagius, known, as, the, battle, of, covadonga, the, figure, of, pelagius, a, by, product, of, the, asturian, chronicles, of, alfonso, iii, written, more, than, a, century, after, the, alleged, battle, has, been, later, reconstructed, in, conflicting, historiographical, theories, most, notably, that, of, a, refuged, visigoth, noble, or, an, autochthonous, astur, chieftain, the, consolidation, of, a, christian, polity, that, came, to, be, known, as, the, kingdom, of, asturias, ensued, later, at, the, end, of, visigothic, rule, the, assimilation, of, hispano, romans, and, visigoths, was, occurring, rapidly, an, unknown, number, fled, and, took, refuge, in, asturias, or, septimania, in, asturias, they,

manuel, de, godoy, charles, iv, embarked, on, policies, that, overturned, much, of, charles, iii, s, reforms, after, briefly, opposing, revolutionary, france, early, in, the, french, revolutionary, wars, spain, was, cajoled, into, an, uneasy, alliance, with, france, only, to, be, blockaded, by, the, british, charles, iv, s, vacillation, culminating, in, his, failure, to, honour, the, alliance, by, neglecting, to, enforce, the, continental, system, led, to, the, invasion, of, spain, in, 1808, under, napoleon, i, thereby, triggering, the, peninsular, war, with, enormous, human, and, property, losses, and, loss, of, control, over, most, of, the, overseas, empire, during, most, of, the, 18th, century, spain, had, arrested, its, relative, decline, of, the, latter, part, of, the, 17th, century, but, despite, the, progress, it, continued, to, lag, in, the, political, and, mercantile, developments, then, transforming, other, parts, of, europe, most, notably, in, great, britain, the, low, countries, and, france, the, chaos, unleashed, by, the, peninsular, war, caused, this, gap, to, widen, greatly, and, slowed, spain, s, industrialisation, the, age, of, enlightenment, reached,

to, catholicism, or, the, church, such, as, characterized, the, french, philosophes, the, leading, spanish, figure, was, benito, feij, o, a, benedictine, monk, and, professor, he, was, a, successful, popularizer, noted, for, encouraging, scientific, and, empirical, thought, by, the, 1770s, the, conservatives, had, launched, a, counterattack, and, used, censorship, and, the, inquisition, to, suppress, enlightenment, ideas, at, the, top, of, the, social, structure, of, spain, in, the, 1780s, stood, the, nobility, and, the, church, a, few, hundred, families, dominated, the, aristocracy, with, another, 500, 000, holding, noble, status, there, were, 200, 000, church, men, and, women, half, of, them, in, heavily, endowed, monasteries, that, controlled, much, of, the, land, not, owned, by, the, nobles, most, people, were, on, farms, either, as, landless, peons, or, as, holders, of, small, properties, the, small, urban, middle, class, was, growing, but, was, distrusted, by, the, landowners, and, peasants, alike, in, the, late, 18th, century, spain, had, an, alliance, with, france, and, therefore, did, not, have, to, fear, a, land, war, its, only, serious, enemy, was, britain, which, had, a, powerful, navy, spain, therefore, concentrated, its, resources, on, its, navy, when, the, french, revolution, overthrew, the, bourbons, a, land, war, with, france, became, a, threat, which, the, king, tried, to, avoid, the, spanish, army, was, ill, prepared, the, officer, corps, was, selected, primarily, on, the, basis, of, royal, patronage, rather, than, merit, about, a, third,

lacked, its, own, horses, oxen, and, mules, for, transportation, so, these, auxiliaries, were, operated, by, civilians, who, might, run, if, conditions, looked, bad, in, combat, small, units, fought, well, but, their, old, fashioned, tactics, were, hardly, of, use, against, the, napoleonic, forces, despite, repeated, desperate, efforts, at, last, minute, reform, when, war, broke, out, with, france, in, 1808, the, army, was, deeply, unpopular, leading, generals, were, assassinated, and, the, army, proved, incompetent, to, handle, command, and, control, junior, officers, from, peasant,

the, army, as, the, worst, in, europe, the, british, who, had, to, work, with, it, agreed, it, was, not, the, army, that, defeated, napoleon, but, the, insurgent, peasants, whom, napoleon, ridiculed, as, packs, of, bandits, led, by, monks, by, 1812, the, army, controlled, only, scattered, enclaves, and, could, only, harass, the, french, with, occasional, raids, the, morale, of, the, army, had, reached, a, nadir, and, reformers, stripped, the, aristocratic, officers, of, most, of, their, legal, privileges, spain, initially, sided, against, france, in, the, napoleonic, wars, but, the, defeat, of, her, army, early, in, the, war, led, to, charles, iv, s, pragmatic, decision, to, align, with, the, french, spain, was, put, under, a, british, blockade, and, her, colonies, began, to, trade, independently, with, britain, but, britain, invaded, and, was, defeated, in, the, british, invasions, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, in, south, america, 1806, and, 1807, without, help, from, mainland, spain, which, emboldened, independence, and, revolutionary, hopes, in, spain, s, american, colonies, a, major, franco, spanish, fleet, was, lost, at, the, battle, of, trafalgar, in, 1805, prompting, the, king, to, reconsider, his, difficult, alliance, with, napoleon, spain, temporarily, broke, off, from, the, continental, system, and, napoleon, invaded, spain, in, 1808, and, deposed, ferdinand, vii, who, had, been, on, the, throne, only, forty, eight, days, after, his, father, s, abdication, in, march, 1808, on, july, 20, 1808, joseph, bonaparte, eldest, brother, of, napoleon, bonaparte, entered, madrid, and, became, king, of, spain, serving, as, a, surrogate, for, napoleon, spaniards, revolted, thompson, says, the, spanish, revolt, was, a, reaction, against, new, institutions, and, ideas, a, movement, for, loyalty, to, the, old, order, to, the, hereditary, crown, of, the, most, catholic, kings, which, napoleon, an, excommunicated, enemy, of, the, pope, had, put, on, the, head, of, a, frenchman, to, the, catholic, church, persecuted, by, republicans, who, had, desecrated, churches, murdered, priests, and, enforced, a, loi, des, cultes, and, to, local, and, provincial, rights, and, privileges, threatened, by, an, efficiently, centralized, government, juntas, were, formed, all, across, spain, that, pronounced, themselves, in, favor, of, ferdinand, vii, on, september, 26, 1808, a, central, junta, was, formed, in, the, town, of, aranjuez, to, coordinate, the, nationwide, struggle, against, the, french, initially, the, central, junta, declared, support, for, ferdinand, vii, and, convened, a, general, and, extraordinary, cortes, for, all, the, kingdoms, of, the, spanish, monarchy, on, february, 22, and, 23, 1809, a, popular, insurrection, against, the, french, occupation, broke, out, all, over, spain, the, peninsular, campaign, was, a, disaster, for, france, napoleon, did, well, when, he, was, in, direct, command, but, that, followed, severe, losses, and, when, he, left, in, 1809, conditions, grew, worse, for, france, vicious, reprisals, famously, portrayed, by, goya, in, the, disasters, of, war, only, made, the, spanish, guerrillas, angrier, and, more, active, the, war, in, spain, proved, to, be, a, major, long, term, drain, on, french, money, manpower, and, prestige, in, march, 1812, the, cortes, of, c, diz, created, the, first, modern, spanish, constitution, the, constitution, of, 1812, informally, named, la, pepa, this, constitution, provided, for, a, separation, of, the, powers, of, the, executive, and, the, legislative, branches, of, government, the, cortes, was, to, be, elected, by, universal, suffrage, albeit, by, an, indirect, method, each, member, of, the, cortes, was, to, represent, 70, 000, people, members, of, the, cortes, were, to, meet, in, annual, sessions, the, king, was, prevented, from, either, convening, or, proroguing, the, cortes, members, of, the, cortes, were, to, serve, single, two, year, terms, they, could, not, serve, consecutive, terms, a, member, could, serve, a, second, term, only, by, allowing, someone, else, to, serve, a, single, intervening, term, in, office, this, attempt, at, the, development, of, a, modern, constitutional, government, lasted, from, 1808, until, 1814, leaders, of, the, liberals, or, reformist, forces, during, this, revolution, were, jos, mo, ino, count, of, floridablanca, gaspar, melchor, de, jovellanos, and, pedro, rodr, guez, conde, de, campomanes, born, in, 1728, floridablanca, was, eighty, years, of, age, at, the, time, of, the, revolutionary, outbreak, in, 1808, he, had, served, as, prime, minister, under, king, charles, iii, from, 1777, until, 1792, however, he, tended, to, be, suspicious, of, the, popular, spontaneity, and, resisted, a, revolution, born, in, 1744, jovellanos, was, somewhat, younger, than, floridablanco, a, writer, and, follower, of, the, philosophers, of, the, enlightenment, tradition, of, the, previous, century, jovellanos, had, served, as, minister, of, justice, from, 1797, to, 1798, and, now, commanded, a, substantial, and, influential, group, within, the, central, junta, however, jovellanos, had, been, imprisoned, by, manuel, de, godoy, duke, of, alcudia, who, had, served, as, the, prime, minister, virtually, running, the, country, as, a, dictator, from, 1792, until, 1798, and, from, 1801, until, 1808, accordingly, even, jovellanos, tended, to, be, somewhat, overly, cautious, in, his, approach, to, the, revolutionary, upsurge, that, was, sweeping, spain, in, 1808, the, spanish, army, was, stretched, as, it, fought, napoleon, s, forces, because, of, a, lack, of, supplies, and, too, many, untrained, recruits, but, at, bail, n, in, june, 1808, the, spanish, army, inflicted, the, first, major, defeat, suffered, by, a, napoleonic, army, this, resulted, in, the, collapse, of, french, power, in, spain, napoleon, took, personal, charge, and, with, fresh, forces, defeating, the, spanish, and, british, armies, in, campaigns, of, attrition, after, this, the, spanish, armies, lost, every, battle, they, fought, against, the, french, but, were, never, annihilated, after, battles, they, retreated, into, the, mountains, to, regroup, and, launch, new, attacks, and, raids, guerrilla, forces, sprang, up, all, over, spain, and, with, the, army, tied, down, huge, numbers, of, napoleon, s, troops, making, it, difficult, to, sustain, concentrated, attacks, on, spanish, forces, the, raids, became, a, massive, drain, on, napoleon, s, military, and, economic, resources, spain, was, aided, by, the, british, and, portuguese, led, by, the, duke, of, wellington, the, duke, of, wellington, fought, napoleon, s, forces, in, the, peninsular, war, with, joseph, bonaparte, playing, a, minor, role, as, king, at, madrid, the, brutal, war, was, one, of, the, first, guerrilla, wars, in, modern, western, history, french, supply, lines, stretching, across, spain, were, mauled, repeatedly, by, the, spanish, armies, and, guerrilla, forces, thereafter, napoleon, s, armies, were, never, able, to, control, much, of, the, country, and, ending, in, french, defeat, the, war, fluctuated, with, wellington, spending, several, years, behind, his, fortresses, in, portugal, while, launching, occasional, campaigns, into, spain, after, napoleon, s, disastrous, 1812, campaign, in, russia, napoleon, began, to, recall, his, forces, for, the, defence, of, france, against, the, advancing, russian, and, other, coalition, forces, leaving, his, forces, in, spain, increasingly, undermanned, and, on, the, defensive, against, the, advancing, spanish, british, and, portuguese, armies, at, the, battle, of, vitoria, in, 1813, an, allied, army, under, the, duke, of, wellington, decisively, defeated, the, french, and, in, 1814, ferdinand, vii, was, restored, as, king, of, spain, spain, lost, all, of, its, north, and, south, american, territories, except, cuba, and, puerto, rico, in, a, complex, series, of, revolts, 1808, 26, spain, was, at, war, with, britain, 1798, 1808, and, the, british, blockade, cut, spain, s, ties, to, the, overseas, empire, trade, was, handled, by, american, and, dutch, traders, the, colonies, thus, had, achieved, economic, independence, from, spain, and, set, up, temporary, governments, or, juntas, which, were, generally, out, of, touch, with, spain, after, 1814, as, napoleon, was, defeated, and, ferdinand, vii, was, back, on, the, throne, the, king, sent, armies, to, regain, control, and, reimpose, autocratic, rule, in, the, next, phase, 1809, 16, spain, defeated, all, the, uprising, a, second, round, 1816, 25, was, successful, and, drove, the, spanish, out, of, all, of, its, mainland, holdings, spain, had, no, help, from, european, powers, indeed, britain, and, the, united, states, worked, against, it, when, they, were, cut, off, from, spain, the, colonies, saw, a, struggle, for, power, between, spaniards, who, were, born, in, spain, called, peninsulares, and, those, of, spanish, descent, born, in, new, spain, called, creoles, the, creoles, were, the, activists, for, independence, multiple, revolutions, enabled, the, colonies, to, break, free, of, the, mother, country, in, 1824, the, armies, of, generals, jos, de, san, mart, n, of, argentina, and, sim, n, bol, var, of, venezuela, defeated, the, last, spanish, forces, the, final, defeat, came, at, the, battle, of, ayacucho, in, southern, peru, after, that, spain, played, a, minor, role, in, international, affairs, business, and, trade, in, the, ex, colonies, were, under, british, control, spain, kept, only, cuba, and, puerto, rico, in, the, new, world, the, napoleonic, wars, had, severe, negative, effects, on, spain, s, long, term, economic, development, the, peninsular, war, ravaged, towns, and, countryside, alike, and, the, demographic, impact, was, the, worst, of, any, spanish, war, with, a, sharp, decline, in, population, in, many, areas, caused, by, casualties, outmigration, and, disruption, of, family, life, the, marauding, armies, seized, farmers, crops, and, more, importantly, farmers, lost, much, of, their, livestock, their, main, capital, asset, severe, poverty, became, widespread, reducing, market, demand, while, the, disruption, of, local, and, international, trade, and, the, shortages, of, critical, inputs, seriously, hurt, industry, and, services, the, loss, of, a, vast, colonial, empire, reduced, spain, s, overall, wealth, and, by, 1820, it, had, become, one, of, europe, s, poorest, and, least, developed, societies, three, fourths, of, the, people, were, illiterate, there, was, little, industry, beyond, the, production, of, textiles, in, catalonia, natural, resources, such, as, coal, and, iron, were, available, for, exploitation, but, the, transportation, system, was, rudimentary, with, few, canals, or, navigable, rivers, and, road, travel, was, slow, and, expensive, british, railroad, builders, were, pessimistic, and, did, not, invest, eventually, a, small, railway, system, was, built, radiating, from, madrid, and, bypassing, the, natural, resources, the, government, relied, on, high, tariffs, especially, on, grain, which, further, slowed, economic, development, for, example, eastern, spain, was, unable, to, import, inexpensive, italian, wheat, and, had, to, rely, on, expensive, homegrown, products, carted, in, over, poor, roads, the, export, market, collapsed, apart, from, some, agricultural, products, catalonia, had, some, industry, but, castile, remained, the, political, and, cultural, center, and, was, not, interested, in, promoting, industry, although, the, juntas, that, had, forced, the, french, to, leave, spain, had, sworn, by, the, liberal, constitution, of, 1812, ferdinand, vii, had, the, support, of, conservatives, and, he, rejected, it, he, ruled, in, the, authoritarian, fashion, of, his, forebears, the, government, nearly, bankrupt, was, unable, to, pay,

cadiz, when, armies, throughout, spain, pronounced, themselves, in, sympathy, with, the, revolters, led, by, rafael, del, riego, ferdinand, was, forced, to, accept, the, liberal, constitution, of, 1812, this, was, the, start, of, the, second, bourgeois, revolution, in, spain, the, trienio, liberal, which, lasted, from, 1820, to, 1823, ferdinand, was, placed, under, effective, house, arrest, for, the, duration, of, the, liberal, experiment, the, tumultuous, three, years, of, liberal, rule, that, followed, 1820, 23, were, marked, by, various, absolutist, conspiracies, the, liberal, government, was, viewed, with, hostility, by, the, congress, of, verona, in, 1822, and, france, was, authorized, to, intervene, france, crushed, the, liberal, government, with, massive, force, in, the, so, called, hundred, thousand, sons, of, saint, louis, expedition, and, ferdinand, was, restored, as, absolute, monarch, in, 1823, in, spain, proper, this, marked, the, end, of, the, second, spanish, bourgeois, revolution, in, spain, the, failure, of, the, second, bourgeois, revolution, was, followed, by, uneasy, peace, for, the, next, decade, having, borne, only, a, female, heir, presumptive, it, appeared, that, ferdinand, would, be, succeeded, by, his, brother, infante, carlos, while, ferdinand, aligned, with, the, conservatives, fearing, another, national, insurrection, he, did, not, view, carlos, s, reactionary, policies, as, a, viable, option, ferdinand, resisting, the, wishes, of, his, brother, decreed, the, pragmatic, sanction, of, 1830, enabling, his, daughter, isabella, to, become, queen, carlos, who, made, known, his, intent, to, resist, the, sanction, fled, to, portugal, ferdinand, s, death, in, 1833, and, the, accession, of, isabella, ii, sparked, the, first, carlist, war, 1833, 39, isabella, was, only, three, years, old, at, the, time, so, her, mother, maria, cristina, of, bourbon, two, sicilies, governed, as, regent, carlos, invaded, the, basque, country, in, the, north, of, spain, and, attracted, support, from, absolutist, reactionaries, and, conservatives, known, as, the, carlist, forces, the, supporters, of, reform, and, of, limitations, on, the, absolutist, rule, of, the, spanish, throne, rallied, behind, isabella, and, the, regent, maria, cristina, these, reformists, were, called, christinos, though, christino, resistance, to, the, insurrection, seemed, to, have, been, overcome, by, the, end, of, 1833, maria, cristina, s, forces, suddenly, drove, the, carlist, armies, from, most, of, the, basque, country, carlos, then, appointed, the, basque, general, tom, s, de, zumalac, rregui, as, his, commander, in, chief, zumalac, rregui, resuscitated, the, carlist, cause, and, by, 1835, had, driven, the, christino, armies, to, the, ebro, river, and, transformed, the, carlist, army, from, a, demoralized, band, into, a, professional, army, of, 30, 000, of, superior, quality, to, the, government, forces, zumalac, rregui, s, death, in, 1835, changed, the, carlists, fortunes, the, christinos, found, a, capable, general, in, baldomero, espartero, his, victory, at, the, battle, of, luchana, 1836, turned, the, tide, of, the, war, and, in, 1839, the, convention, of, vergara, put, an, end, to, the, first, carlist, insurrection, the, progressive, general, espartero, exploiting, his, popularity, as, a, war, hero, and, his, sobriquet, pacifier, of, spain, demanded, liberal, reforms, from, maria, cristina, the, queen, regent, preferred, to, resign, and, let, espartero, become, regent, instead, in, 1840, espartero, s, liberal, reforms, were, then, opposed, by, moderates, and, the, former, general, s, heavy, handedness, caused, a, series, of, sporadic, uprisings, throughout, the, country, from, various, quarters, all, of, which, were, bloodily, suppressed, he, was, overthrown, as, regent, in, 1843, by, ram, n, mar, a, narv, ez, a, moderate, who, was, in, turn, perceived, as, too, reactionary, another, carlist, uprising, the, matiners, war, was, launched, in, 1846, in, catalonia, but, it, was, poorly, organized, and, suppressed, by, 1849, isabella, ii, took, a, more, active, role, in, government, after, coming, of, age, but, she, was, unpopular, throughout, her, reign, 1833, 68, there, was, another, pronunciamiento, in, 1854, led, general, leopoldo, o, donnell, intending, to, topple, the, discredited, rule, of, the, count, of, san, luis, a, popular, insurrection, followed, the, coup, and, the, progressive, party, obtained, widespread, support, in, spain, and, came, to, government, in, 1854, after, 1856, o, donnell, who, had, already, marched, on, madrid, that, year, and, ousted, another, espartero, ministry, attempted, to, form, the, liberal, union, his, own, political, project, following, attacks, on, ceuta, by, tribesmen, based, in, morocco, a, war, against, the, latter, country, was, successfully, waged, by, generals, o, donnell, and, juan, prim, the, later, part, of, isabella, s, reign, saw, also, the, spanish, retake, of, santo, domingo, 1861, 1865, and, the, fruitless, chincha, islands, war, 1864, 1866, against, peru, and, chile, in, 1868, another, insurgency, known, as, the, glorious, revolution, took, place, the, progresista, generals, francisco, serrano, and, juan, prim, revolted, against, isabella, and, defeated, her, moderado, generals, at, the, battle, of, alcolea, 1868, isabella, was, driven, into, exile, in, paris, two, years, later, in, 1870, the, cortes, declared, that, spain, would, again, have, a, king, amadeus, of, savoy, the, second, son, of, king, victor, emmanuel, ii, of, italy, was, selected, and, duly, crowned, king, of, spain, early, the, following, year, amadeus, a, liberal, who, swore, by, the, liberal, constitution, the, cortes, promulgated, was, faced, immediately, with, the, incredible, task, of, bringing, the, disparate, political, ideologies, of, spain, to, one, table, the, country, was, plagued, by, internecine, strife, not, merely, between, spaniards, but, within, spanish, parties, following, the, hidalgo, affair, and, an, army, rebellion, amadeus, famously, declared, the, people, of, spain, to, be, ungovernable, abdicated, the, throne, and, left, the, country, in, the, absence, of, the, monarch, a, government, of, radicals, and, republicans, was, formed, and, declared, spain, a, republic, the, first, spanish, republic, 1873, 74, was, immediately, under, siege, from, all, quarters, the, carlists, were, the, most, immediate, threat, launching, a, violent, insurrection, after, their, poor, showing, in, the, 1872, elections, there, were, calls, for, socialist, revolution, from, the, international, workingmen, s, association, revolts, and, unrest, in, the, autonomous, regions, of, navarre, and, catalonia, and, pressure, from, the, catholic, church, against, the, fledgling, republic, a, coup, took, place, in, january, 1874, when, general, pav, a, broke, into, the, cortes, this, prevented, the, formation, of, a, federal, republican, government, forced, the, dissolution, of, the, parliament, and, led, to, the, instauration, of, a, unitary, praetorian, republic, ruled, by, general, serrano, paving, the, way, for, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, through, another, pronunciamiento, this, time, by, arsenio, mart, nez, campos, in, december, 1874, following, the, success, of, a, december, 1874, military, coup, the, monarchy, was, restored, in, the, person, of, alfonso, xii, the, son, of, former, queen, isabella, ii, the, ongoing, carlist, insurrection, was, eventually, put, down, the, restoration, period, following, the, proclamation, of, the, 1876, constitution, witnessed, the, installment, of, an, uncompetitive, parliamentary, system, devised, by, antonio, c, novas, del, castillo, in, which, two, dynastic, parties, the, conservatives, and, the, liberals, alternated, in, control, of, the, government, turnismo, election, fraud, materialized, in, the, so, called, caciquismo, became, ubiquitous, with, elections, reproducing, pre, arranged, outcomes, struck, in, the, capital, voter, apathy, was, no, less, important, the, reign, of, alfonso, was, followed, by, that, of, his, son, alfonso, xiii, initially, a, regency, until, the, latter, s, coming, of, age, in, 1902, the, 1876, constitution, granted, the, catholic, church, control, of, education, particularly, secondary, education, meanwhile, an, organization, formed, in, 1876, upon, a, group, of, krausists, educators, the, instituci, n, libre, de, ense, anza, had, a, leading, role, in, the, educational, and, cultural, renovation, in, the, country, covering, for, the, inaction, of, the, spanish, state, in, 1868, cuba, launched, a, war, of, independence, against, spain, as, had, been, the, case, in, santo, domingo, the, spanish, government, was, embroiled, in, a, difficult, campaign, against, an, indigenous, rebellion, unlike, in, santo, domingo, however, spain, initially, won, this, struggle, the, pacification, of, the, island, was, temporary, however, as, the, conflict, revived, in, 1895, and, ended, in, defeat, at, the, hands, of, the, united, states, in, the, spanish, american, war, of, 1898, cuba, gained, its, independence, and, spain, lost, its, remaining, new, world, colony, puerto, rico, which, together, with, guam, and, the, philippines, were, ceded, to, the, united, states, for, 20, million, in, 1899, spain, sold, its, remaining, pacific, islands, the, northern, mariana, islands, caroline, islands, and, palau, to, germany, and, spanish, colonial, possessions, were, reduced, to, spanish, morocco, spanish, sahara, and, spanish, guinea, all, in, africa, the, disaster, of, 1898, created, the, generation, of, 98, a, group, of, statesmen, and, intellectuals, who, demanded, liberal, change, from, the, new, government, however, both, anarchism, on, the, left, and, fascism, on, the, right, grew, rapidly, in, the, early, 20th, century, a, revolt, in, 1909, in, catalonia, was, bloodily, suppressed, jensen, 1999, argues, that, the, defeat, of, 1898, led, many, military, officers, to, abandon, the, liberalism, that, had, been, strong, in, the, officer, corps, and, turn, to, the, right, they, interpreted, the, american, victory, in, 1898, as, well, as, the, japanese, victory, against, russia, in, 1905, as, proof, of, the, superiority, of, willpower, and, moral, values, over, technology, over, the, next, three, decades, jensen, argues, these, values, shaped, the, outlook, of, francisco, franco, and, other, falangists, the, bipartisan, system, began, to, collapse, in, the, later, years, of, the, constitutional, part, of, the, reign, of, alfonso, xiii, with, the, dynastic, parties, largely, disintegrating, into, factions, the, conservatives, faced, a, schism, between, datistas, mauristas, and, ciervistas, the, liberal, camp, split, into, the, mainstream, liberals, followers, of, the, count, of, romanones, romanonistas, and, the, followers, of, manuel, garc, a, prieto, the, democrats, prietistas, an, additional, liberal, albista, faction, was, later, added, to, the, last, two, spain, s, neutrality, in, world, war, i, spared, the, country, from, carnage, yet, the, conflict, caused, massive, economic, disruption, with, the, country, experiencing, at, the, same, time, an, economic, boom, the, increasing, foreign, demand, of, products, and, the, drop, of, imports, brought, hefty, profits, and, widespread, social, distress, with, mounting, inflation, shortage, of, basic, goods, and, extreme, income, inequality, a, major, revolutionary, strike, was, called, for, august, 1917, supported, by, the, spanish, socialist, workers, party, the, ugt, and, the, cnt, seeking, to, overthrow, the, government, the, dato, government, deployed, the, army, against, the, workers, to, brutally, quell, any, threat, to, social, order, sealing, in, turn, the, demise, of, the, cabinet, and, undermining, the, constitutional, order, the, strike, was, one, of, the, three, simultaneous, developments, of, a, wider, three, headed, crisis, in, 1917, that, cracked, the, restoration, regime, that, also, included, a, military, crisis, induced, by, the, cleavage, in, the, armed, forces, between, mainland, and, africa, based, ranks, vis, vis, the, military, promotion, and, ensuing, formation, of, juntas, of, officers, that, refused, to, dissolve, upon, request, from, the, government, and, a, political, crisis, brought, by, the, challenge, posed, by, catalan, nationalism, whose, bourgeois, was, emboldened, by, the, economic, upswing, during, the, rif, war, the, crushing, defeat, of, the, spanish, army, in, the, so, called, disaster, of, annual, in, the, summer, of, 1921, brought, in, a, matter, of, days, the, catastrophic, loss, of, the, lives, of, about, 9, 000, spanish, soldiers, and, the, loss, of, all, occupied, territory, in, morocco, that, had, been, gained, since, 1912, this, entailed, the, greatest, defeat, suffered, by, a, european, power, in, an, african, colonial, war, in, the, 20th, century, alfonso, xiii, tacitly, endorsed, the, september, 1923, coup, by, general, miguel, primo, de, rivera, that, installed, a, dictatorship, led, by, the, latter, the, regime, enforced, the, state, of, war, all, over, the, country, from, september, 1923, to, may, 1925, attempts, to, institutionalise, the, regime, were, taken, in, the, form, of, a, single, official, party, the, patriotic, union, and, a, consultative, chamber, the, national, assembly, preceded, by, a, partial, retreat, from, vulnerable, posts, in, the, interior, of, the, protectorate, in, morocco, spain, in, joint, action, with, france, turned, the, tides, in, morocco, in, 1925, and, the, abd, el, krim,

dragged, on, since, 1917, and, cost, spain, 800, million, the, spanish, officers, of, the, war, ended, up, taking, the, brutality, of, the, colonial, military, practices, to, the, mainland, the, late, 1920s, were, prosperous, until, the, worldwide, great, depression, hit, in, 1929, in, early, 1930, bankruptcy, and, massive, unpopularity, forced, the, king, to, remove, primo, de, rivera, primo, de,

enter, the, radical, government, an, armed, rising, of, workers, in, october, 1934, which, reached, its, greatest, intensity, in, asturias, was, forcefully, put, down, this, in, turn, energized,

and, conservatives, worldwide, there, was, a, decline, in, pacifism, and, a, growing, sense, that, another, world, war, was, imminent, and, that, it, was, worth, fighting, for, after, the, spanish,

the, nationalists, and, allowed, the, trans, shipment, of, supplies, to, franco, s, forces, the, soviets, sold, tanks, and, other, armaments, for, spanish, gold, and, sent, well, trained, officers, and, political, commissars, it, organized, the, mobilization, of, tens, of, thousands, of, mostly, communist, volunteers, from, around, the, world, who, formed, the, international, brigades, in, 1936, the, left, united, in, the, popular, front, and, were, elected, to, power, however, this, coalition, dominated, by, the, centre, left, was, undermined, both, by, the, revolutionary, groups, such, as, the, anarchist, confederaci, n, nacional, del, trabajo, cnt, and, federaci, n, anarquista, ib, rica, fai, and, by, anti, democratic, far, right, groups, such, as, the, falange, and, the, carlists,

falangist, politician, jos, calvo, sotelo, was, shot, by, republican, police, they, used, it, as, a, signal, to, act, while, the, republican, leadership, was, confused, and, inert, the, nationalists, under, franco, won, the, war, and, historians, continue, to, debate, the, reasons, the, nationalists, were, much, better, unified, and, led, than, the, republicans, who, squabbled, and, fought, amongst, themselves, endlessly, and, had, no, clear, military, strategy, the, army, went, over, to, the, nationalists, but, it, was, very, poorly, equipped, there, were, no, tanks, or, modern, airplanes, the, small, navy, supported, the, republicans, but, their, armies, were, made, up, of, raw, recruits, and, they, lacked, both, equipment, and, skilled, officers, and, sergeants, nationalist, senior, officers, were, much, better, trained, and, more, familiar, with, modern, tactics, than, the, republicans, on, 17, july, 1936, general, francisco, franco, brought, the, colonial,

immediately, but, successful, resistance, by, republicans, in, the, key, centers, of, madrid, barcelona, valencia, the, basque, country, and, other, points, meant, that, spain, faced, a, prolonged, civil, war, by, 1937, much, of, the, south, and, west, was, under, the, control, of, the, nationalists, whose, army, of, africa, was, the, most, professional, force, available, to, either, side, both, sides, received, foreign, military, aid, the, nationalists, from, nazi, germany, and, italy, while, the, republicans, were, supported, by, organised, far, left, volunteers, from, the, soviet, union, the, siege, of, the, alc, zar, at, toledo, early, in, the, war, was, a, turning, point, with, the, nationalists, successfully, resisting, after, a, long, siege, the, republicans, managed, to, hold, out, in, madrid, despite, a, nationalist, assault, in, november, 1936, and, frustrated, subsequent, offensives, against, the, capital, at, jarama, and, guadalajara, in, 1937, soon, though, the, nationalists, began, to, erode, their, territory, starving, madrid, and, making, inroads, into, the, east, the, north, including, the, basque, country, fell, in, late, 1937, and, the, aragon, front, collapsed, shortly, afterwards, the, bombing, of, guernica, on, the, afternoon, of, 26, april, 1937, a, mission, used, as, a, testing, ground, for, the, german, luftwaffe, s, condor, legion, was,
