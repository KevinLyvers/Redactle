the, greco, persian, wars, also, often, called, the, persian, wars, were, a, series, of, conflicts, between, the, achaemenid, empire, and, greek, city, states, that, started, in, 499, bc, and, lasted, until, 449, bc, the, collision, between, the, fractious, political, world, of, the, greeks, and, the, enormous, empire, of, the, persians, began, when, cyrus, the, great, conquered, the, greek, inhabited, region, of, ionia, in, 547, bc, struggling, to, control, the, independent, minded, cities, of, ionia, the, persians, appointed, tyrants, to, rule, each, of, them, this, would, prove, to, be, the, source, of, much, trouble, for, the, greeks, and, persians, alike, in, 499, bc, the, tyrant, of, miletus, aristagoras, embarked, on, an, expedition, to, conquer, the, island, of, naxos, with, persian, support, however, the, expedition, was, a, debacle, and, preempting, his, dismissal, aristagoras, incited, all, of, hellenic, asia, minor, into, rebellion, against, the, persians, this, was, the, beginning, of, the, ionian, revolt, which, would, last, until, 493, bc, progressively, drawing, more, regions, of, asia, minor, into, the, conflict, aristagoras, secured, military, support, from, athens, and, eretria, and, in, 498, bc, these, forces, helped, to, capture, and, burn, the, persian, regional, capital, of, sardis, the, persian, king, darius, the, great, vowed, to, have, revenge, on, athens, and, eretria, for, this, act, the, revolt, continued, with, the, two, sides, effectively, stalemated, throughout, 497, 495, bc, in, 494, bc, the, persians, regrouped, and, attacked, the, epicenter, of, the, revolt, in, miletus, at, the, battle, of, lade, the, ionians, suffered, a, decisive, defeat, and, the, rebellion, collapsed, with, the, final, embers, being, stamped, out, the, following, year, seeking, to, secure, his, empire, from, further, revolts, and, from, the, interference, of, the, mainland, greeks, darius, embarked, on, a, scheme, to, conquer, greece, and, to, punish, athens, and, eretria, for, the, burning, of, sardis, the, first, persian, invasion, of, greece, began, in, 492, bc, with, the, persian, general, mardonius, successfully, re, subjugating, thrace, and, macedon, before, several, mishaps, forced, an, early, end, to, the, rest, of, the, campaign, in, 490, bc, a, second, force, was, sent, to, greece, this, time, across, the, aegean, sea, under, the, command, of, datis, and, artaphernes, this, expedition, subjugated, the, cyclades, before, besieging, capturing, and, razing, eretria, however, while, en, route, to, attack, athens, the, persian, force, was, decisively, defeated, by, the, athenians, at, the, battle, of, marathon, ending, persian, efforts, for, the, time, being, darius, then, began, to, plan, to, completely, conquer, greece, but, died, in, 486, bc, and, responsibility, for, the, conquest, passed, to, his, son, xerxes, in, 480, bc, xerxes, personally, led, the, second, persian, invasion, of, greece, with, one, of, the, largest, ancient, armies, ever, assembled, victory, over, the, allied, greek, states, at, the, famous, battle, of, thermopylae, allowed, the, persians, to, torch, an, evacuated, athens, and, overrun, most, of, greece, however, while, seeking, to, destroy, the, combined, greek, fleet, the, persians, suffered, a, severe, defeat, at, the, battle, of, salamis, the, following, year, the, confederated, greeks, went, on, the, offensive, decisively, defeating, the, persian, army, at, the, battle, of, plataea, and, ending, the, invasion, of, greece, by, the, achaemenid, empire, the, allied, greeks, followed, up, their, success, by, destroying, the, rest, of, the, persian, fleet, at, the, battle, of, mycale, before, expelling, persian, garrisons, from, sestos, 479, bc, and, byzantium, 478, bc, following, the, persian, withdrawal, from, europe, and, the, greek, victory, at, mycale, macedon, and, the, city, states, of, ionia, regained, their, independence, the, actions, of, the, general, pausanias, at, the, siege, of, byzantium, alienated, many, of, the, greek, states, from, the, spartans, and, the, anti, persian, alliance, was, therefore, reconstituted, around, athenian, leadership, called, the, delian, league, the, delian, league, continued, to, campaign, against, persia, for, the, next, three, decades, beginning, with, the, expulsion, of, the, remaining, persian, garrisons, from, europe, at, the, battle, of, the, eurymedon, in, 466, bc, the, league, won, a, double, victory, that, finally, secured, freedom, for, the, cities, of, ionia, however, the, league, s, involvement, in, the, egyptian, revolt, by, inaros, ii, against, artaxerxes, i, from, 460, 454, bc, resulted, in, a, disastrous, greek, defeat, and, further, campaigning, was, suspended, a, greek, fleet, was, sent, to, cyprus, in, 451, bc, but, achieved, little, and, when, it, withdrew, the, greco, persian, wars, drew, to, a, quiet, end, some, historical, sources, suggest, the, end, of, hostilities, was, marked, by, a, peace, treaty, between, athens, and, persia, the, peace, of, callias, all, the, surviving, primary, sources, for, the, greco, persian, wars, are, greek, no, contemporary, accounts, survive, in, other, languages, by, far, the, most, important, source, is, the, fifth, century, greek, historian, herodotus, herodotus, who, has, been, called, the, father, of, history, was, born, in, 484, bc, in, halicarnassus, asia, minor, then, part, of, the, persian, empire, he, wrote, his, enquiries, greek, historia, english, the, histories, around, 440, 430, bc, trying, to, trace, the, origins, of, the, greco, persian, wars, which, would, still, have, been, recent, history, herodotus, s, approach, was, novel, and, at, least, in, western, society, he, invented, history, as, a, discipline, as, historian, tom, holland, has, it, for, the, first, time, a, chronicler, set, himself, to, trace, the, origins, of, a, conflict, not, to, a, past, so, remote, so, as, to, be, utterly, fabulous, nor, to, the, whims, and, wishes, of, some, god, nor, to, a, people, s, claim, to, manifest, destiny, but, rather, explanations, he, could, verify, personally, some, later, ancient, historians, starting, with, thucydides, criticized, herodotus, and, his, methods, nevertheless, thucydides, chose, to, begin, his, history, where, herodotus, left, off, at, the, siege, of, sestos, and, felt, herodotus, s, history, was, accurate, enough, not, to, need, re, writing, or, correcting, plutarch, criticised, herodotus, in, his, essay, on, the, malignity, of, herodotus, describing, herodotus, as, philobarbaros, barbarian, lover, for, not, being, pro, greek, enough, which, suggests, that, herodotus, might, actually, have, done, a, reasonable, job, of, being, even, handed, a, negative, view, of, herodotus, was, passed, on, to, renaissance, europe, though, he, remained, widely, read, however, since, the, 19th, century, his, reputation, has, been, dramatically, rehabilitated, by, archaeological, finds, that, have, repeatedly, confirmed, his, version, of, events, the, prevailing, modern, view, is, that, herodotus, did, a, remarkable, job, in, his, historia, but, that, some, of, his, specific, details, particularly, troop, numbers, and, dates, should, be, viewed, with, skepticism, nevertheless, there, are, still, some, historians, who, believe, herodotus, made, up, much, of, his, story, the, military, history, of, greece, between, the, end, of, the, second, persian, invasion, of, greece, and, the, peloponnesian, war, 479, 431, bc, is, not, well, supported, by, surviving, ancient, sources, this, period, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, pentekontaetia, the, fifty, years, by, ancient, writers, was, a, period, of, relative, peace, and, prosperity, within, greece, the, richest, source, for, the, period, and, also, the, most, contemporaneous, is, thucydides, history, of, the, peloponnesian, war, which, is, generally, considered, by, modern, historians, to, be, a, reliable, primary, account, thucydides, only, mentions, this, period, in, a, digression, on, the, growth, of, athenian, power, in, the, run, up, to, the, peloponnesian, war, and, the, account, is, brief, probably, selective, and, lacks, any, dates, nevertheless, thucydides, s, account, can, be, and, is, used, by, historians, to, draw, up, a, skeleton, chronology, for, the, period, on, to, which, details, from, archaeological, records, and, other, writers, can, be, superimposed, more, detail, for, the, whole, period, is, provided, by, plutarch, in, his, biographies, of, themistocles, aristides, and, especially, cimon, plutarch, was, writing, some, 600, years, after, the, events, in, question, and, is, therefore, a, secondary, source, but, he, often, names, his, sources, which, allows, some, degree, of, verification, of, his, statements, in, his, biographies, he, draws, directly, from, many, ancient, histories, that, have, not, survived, and, thus, often, preserves, details, of, the, period, that, are, omitted, in, herodotus, and, thucydides, s, accounts, the, final, major, existing, source, for, the, period, is, the, universal, history, bibliotheca, historica, of, the, 1st, century, bc, sicilian, diodorus, siculus, much, of, diodorus, s, writing, about, this, period, is, drawn, from, the, much, earlier, greek, historian, ephorus, who, also, wrote, a, universal, history, diodorus, is, also, a, secondary, source, and, often, derided, by, modern, historians, for, his, style, and, inaccuracies, but, he, preserves, many, details, of, the, ancient, period, found, nowhere, else, further, scattered, details, can, be, found, in, pausanias, s, description, of, greece, while, the, byzantine, suda, dictionary, of, the, 10th, century, ad, preserves, some, anecdotes, found, nowhere, else, minor, sources, for, the, period, include, the, works, of, pompeius, trogus, epitomized, by, justinus, cornelius, nepos, and, ctesias, of, cnidus, epitomized, by, photius, which, are, not, in, their, original, textual, form, these, works, are, not, considered, reliable, especially, ctesias, and, are, not, particularly, useful, for, reconstructing, the, history, of, this, period, a, few, physical, remnants, of, the, conflict, have, been, found, by, archaeologists, the, most, famous, is, the, serpent, column, in, istanbul, which, was, originally, placed, at, delphi, to, commemorate, the, greek, victory, at, plataea, in, 1939, greek, archaeologist, spyridon, marinatos, found, the, remains, of, numerous, persian, arrowheads, at, the, kolonos, hill, on, the, field, of, thermopylae, which, is, now, generally, identified, as, the, site, of, the, defender, s, last, stand, the, greeks, of, the, classical, period, believed, that, in, the, dark, age, that, followed, the, collapse, of, the, mycenaean, civilization, significant, numbers, of, greeks, fled, and, had, emigrated, to, asia, minor, and, settled, there, modern, historians, generally, accept, this, migration, as, historic, but, separate, from, the, later, colonization, of, the, mediterranean, by, the, greeks, there, are, however, those, who, believe, the, ionian, migration, cannot, be, explained, as, simply, as, the, classical, greeks, claimed, these, settlers, were, from, three, tribal, groups, the, aeolians, dorians, and, ionians, the, ionians, had, settled, about, the, coasts, of, lydia, and, caria, founding, the, twelve, cities, that, made, up, ionia, these, cities, were, miletus, myus, and, priene, in, caria, ephesus, colophon, lebedos, teos, clazomenae, phocaea, and, erythrae, in, lydia, and, the, islands, of, samos, and, chios, although, the, ionian, cities, were, independent, of, one, another, they, recognized, their, shared, heritage, and, supposedly, had, a, common, temple, and, meeting, place, the, panionion, they, thus, formed, a, cultural, league, to, which, they, would, admit, no, other, cities, or, even, other, tribal, ionians, the, cities, of, ionia, remained, independent, until, they, were, conquered, by, the, lydians, of, western, asia, minor, the, lydian, king, alyattes, attacked, miletus, a, conflict, that, ended, with, a, treaty, of, alliance, between, miletus, and, lydia, that, meant, that, miletus, would, have, internal, autonomy, but, follow, lydia, in, foreign, affairs, at, this, time, the, lydians, were, also, in, conflict, with, the, median, empire, and, the, milesians, sent, an, army, to, aid, the, lydians, in, this, conflict, eventually, a, peaceable, settlement, was, established, between, the, medes, and, the, lydians, with, the, halys, river, set, up, as, the, border, between, the, kingdoms, the, famous, lydian, king, croesus, succeeded, his, father, alyattes, in, around, 560, bc, and, set, about, conquering, the, other, greek, city, states, of, asia, minor, the, persian, prince, cyrus, led, a, rebellion, against, the, last, median, king, astyages, in, 553, bc, cyrus, was, a, grandson, of, astyages, and, was, supported, by, part, of, the, median, aristocracy, by, 550, bc, the, rebellion, was, over, and, cyrus, had, emerged, victorious, founding, the, achaemenid, empire, in, place, of, the, median, kingdom, in, the, process, croesus, saw, the, disruption, in, the, median, empire, and, persia, as, an, opportunity, to, extend, his, realm, and, asked, the, oracle, of, delphi, whether, he, should, attack, them, the, oracle, supposedly, replied, the, famously, ambiguous, answer, that, if, croesus, was, to, cross, the, halys, he, would, destroy, a, great, empire, blind, to, the, ambiguity, of, this, prophecy, croesus, attacked, the, persians, but, was, eventually, defeated, and, lydia, fell, to, cyrus, while, fighting, the, lydians, cyrus, had, sent, messages, to, the, ionians, asking, them, to, revolt, against, lydian, rule, which, the, ionians, had, refused, to, do, after, cyrus, finished, the, conquest, of, lydia, the, ionian, cities, now, offered, to, be, his, subjects, under, the, same, terms, as, they, had, been, subjects, of, croesus, cyrus, refused, citing, the, ionians, unwillingness, to, help, him, previously, the, ionians, thus, prepared, to, defend, themselves, and, cyrus, sent, the, median, general, harpagus, to, conquer, them, he, first, attacked, phocaea, the, phocaeans, decided, to, abandon, their, city, entirely, and, sail, into, exile, in, sicily, rather, than, become, persian, subjects, although, many, later, returned, some, teians, also, chose, to, emigrate, when, harpagus, attacked, teos, but, the, rest, of, the, ionians, remained, and, were, each, in, turn, conquered, in, the, years, following, their, conquest, the, persians, found, the, ionians, difficult, to, rule, elsewhere, in, the, empire, cyrus, identified, elite, native, groups, such, as, the, priesthood, of, judea, to, help, him, rule, his, new, subjects, no, such, group, existed, in, greek, cities, at, this, time, while, there, was, usually, an, aristocracy, this, was, inevitably, divided, into, feuding, factions, the, persians, thus, settled, for, sponsoring, a, tyrant, in, each, ionian, city, even, though, this, drew, them, into, the, ionians, internal, conflicts, furthermore, certain, tyrants, might, develop, an, independent, streak, and, have, to, be, replaced, the, tyrants, themselves, faced, a, difficult, task, they, had, to, deflect, the, worst, of, their, fellow, citizens, hatred, while, staying, in, the, favour, of, the, persians, in, the, past, greek, states, had, often, been, ruled, by, tyrants, but, that, form, of, government, was, on, the, decline, past, tyrants, had, also, tended, and, needed, to, be, strong, and, able, leaders, whereas, the, rulers, appointed, by, the, persians, were, simply, place, men, backed, by, persian, military, might, these, tyrants, did, not, need, the, support, of, the, population, and, could, thus, rule, absolutely, on, the, eve, of, the, greco, persian, wars, it, is, probable, that, the, ionian, population, had, become, discontented, and, was, ready, for, rebellion, in, the, greco, persian, wars, both, sides, made, use, of, spear, armed, infantry, and, light, missile, troops, greek, armies, placed, the, emphasis, on, heavier, infantry, while, persian, armies, favoured, lighter, troop, types, the, persian, military, consisted, of, a, diverse, group, of, men, drawn, across, the, various, nations, of, the, empire, however, according, to, herodotus, there, was, at, least, a, general, conformity, in, armor, and, style, of, fighting, the, troops, were, usually, armed, with, a, bow, a, short, spear, and, a, sword, or, axe, and, carried, a, wicker, shield, they, wore, a, leather, jerkin, although, individuals, of, high, status, wore, high, quality, metal, armor, the, persians, most, likely, used, their, bows, to, wear, down, the, enemy, then, closed, in, to, deliver, the, final, blow, with, spears, and, swords, the, first, rank, of, persian, infantry, formations, the, so, called, sparabara, had, no, bows, carried, larger, wicker, shields, and, were, sometimes, armed, with, longer, spears, their, role, was, to, protect, the, back, ranks, of, the, formation, the, cavalry, probably, fought, as, lightly, armed, missile, cavalry, the, style, of, warfare, between, the, greek, city, states, which, dates, back, until, at, least, 650, bc, as, dated, by, the, chigi, vase, was, based, around, the, hoplite, phalanx, supported, by, missile, troops, the, hoplites, were, foot, soldiers, usually, drawn, from, the, members, of, the, middle, classes, in, athens, called, the, zeugites, who, could, afford, the, equipment, necessary, to, fight, in, this, manner, the, heavy, armour, the, hoplon, usually, included, a, breastplate, or, a, linothorax, greaves, a, helmet, and, a, large, round, concave, shield, the, aspis, hoplites, were, armed, with, long, spears, the, dory, which, were, significantly, longer, than, persian, spears, and, a, sword, the, xiphos, the, heavy, armour, and, longer, spears, made, them, superior, in, hand, to, hand, combat, and, gave, them, significant, protection, against, ranged, attacks, lightly, armed, skirmishers, the, psiloi, also, comprised, a, part, of, greek, armies, growing, in, importance, during, the, conflict, at, the, battle, of, plataea, for, instance, they, may, have, formed, over, half, the, greek, army, use, of, cavalry, in, greek, armies, is, not, reported, in, the, battles, of, the, greco, persian, wars, at, the, beginning, of, the, conflict, all, naval, forces, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, had, switched, to, the, trireme, a, warship, powered, by, three, banks, of, oars, the, most, common, naval, tactics, during, the, period, were, ramming, greek, triremes, were, equipped, with, a, cast, bronze, ram, at, the, bows, or, boarding, by, ship, borne, marines, more, experienced, naval, powers, had, by, this, time, also, begun, to, use, a, manoeuver, known, as, diekplous, it, is, not, clear, what, this, was, but, it, probably, involved, sailing, into, gaps, between, enemy, ships, and, then, ramming, them, in, the, side, the, persian, naval, forces, were, primarily, provided, by, the, seafaring, people, of, the, empire, phoenicians, egyptians, cilicians, and, cypriots, other, coastal, regions, of, the, persian, empire, would, contribute, ships, throughout, the, course, of, the, wars, in, 507, bc, artaphernes, as, brother, of, darius, i, and, satrap, of, asia, minor, in, his, capital, sardis, received, an, embassy, from, newly, democratic, athens, probably, sent, by, cleisthenes, which, was, looking, for, persian, assistance, to, resist, the, threats, from, sparta, herodotus, reports, that, artaphernes, had, no, previous, knowledge, of, the, athenians, and, his, initial, reaction, was, who, are, these, people, artaphernes, asked, the, athenians, for, water, and, earth, a, symbol, of, submission, if, they, wanted, help, from, the, achaemenid, king, the, athenians, ambassadors, apparently, accepted, to, comply, and, to, give, earth, and, water, artaphernes, also, advised, the, athenians, that, they, should, receive, back, the, athenian, tyrant, hippias, the, persians, threatened, to, attack, athens, if, they, did, not, accept, hippias, nevertheless, the, athenians, preferred, to, remain, democratic, despite, the, danger, from, persia, and, the, ambassadors, were, disavowed, and, censured, upon, their, return, to, athens, the, athenians, dispatched, envoys, to, sardis, desiring, to, make, an, alliance, with, the, persians, for, they, knew, that, they, had, provoked, the, lacedaemonians, and, cleomenes, to, war, when, the, envoys, came, to, sardis, and, spoke, as, they, had, been, bidden, artaphrenes, son, of, hystaspes, viceroy, of, sardis, asked, them, what, men, are, you, and, where, dwell, you, who, desire, alliance, with, the, persians, being, informed, by, the, envoys, he, gave, them, an, answer, whereof, the, substance, was, that, if, the, athenians, gave, king, darius, earth, and, water, then, he, would, make, alliance, with, them, but, if, not, his, command, was, that, they, should, begone, the, envoys, consulted, together, and, consented, to, give, what, was, asked, in, their, desire, to, make, the, alliance, so, they, returned, to, their, own, country, and, were, then, greatly, blamed, for, what, they, had, done, there, is, a, possibility, that, the, achaemenid, ruler, now, saw, the, athenians, as, subjects, who, had, solemnly, promised, submission, through, the, gift, of, earth, and, water, and, that, subsequent, actions, by, the, athenians, such, as, their, intervention, in, the, ionian, revolt, were, perceived, as, a, break, of, oath, and, a, rebellion, to, the, central, authority, of, the, achaemenid, ruler, the, ionian, revolt, and, associated, revolts, in, aeolis, doris, cyprus, and, caria, were, military, rebellions, by, several, regions, of, asia, minor, against, persian, rule, lasting, from, 499, to, 493, bc, at, the, heart, of, the, rebellion, was, the, dissatisfaction, of, the, greek, cities, of, asia, minor, with, the, tyrants, appointed, by, persia, to, rule, them, along, with, opposition, to, the, individual, actions, of, two, milesian, tyrants, histiaeus, and, aristagoras, in, 499, bc, the, then, tyrant, of, miletus, aristagoras, launched, a, joint, expedition, with, the, persian, satrap, artaphernes, to, conquer, naxos, in, an, attempt, to, bolster, his, position, in, miletus, both, financially, and, in, terms, of, prestige, the, mission, was, a, debacle, and, sensing, his, imminent, removal, as, tyrant, aristagoras, chose, to, incite, the, whole, of, ionia, into, rebellion, against, the, persian, king, darius, the, great, struggling, to, rule, the, independent, minded, cities, of, ionia, the, persians, appointed, local, tyrants, to, rule, each, of, them, this, would, prove, to, be, the, source, of, much, trouble, for, the, greeks, and, persians, alike, in, 498, bc, supported, by, troops, from, athens, and, eretria, the, ionians, marched, on, captured, and, burnt, sardis, however, on, their, return, journey, to, ionia, they, were, followed, by, persian, troops, and, decisively, beaten, at, the, battle, of, ephesus, this, campaign, was, the, only, offensive, action, taken, by, the, ionians, who, subsequently, went, on, the, defensive, the, persians, responded, in, 497, bc, with, a, three, pronged, attack, aimed, at, recapturing, the, outlying, areas, of, the, rebellious, territory, but, the, spread, of, the, revolt, to, caria, meant, the, largest, army, under, darius, moved, there, instead, while, at, first, campaigning, successfully, in, caria, this, army, was, wiped, out, in, an, ambush, at, the, battle, of, pedasus, this, resulted, in, a, stalemate, for, the, rest, of, 496, and, 495, bc, by, 494, bc, the, persian, army, and, navy, had, regrouped, and, they, made, straight, for, the, epicentre, of, the, rebellion, at, miletus, the, ionian, fleet, sought, to, defend, miletus, by, sea, but, was, defeated, decisively, at, the, battle, of, lade, after, the, samians, had, defected, miletus, was, then, besieged, captured, and, its, population, was, enslaved, this, double, defeat, effectively, ended, the, revolt, and, the, carians, surrendered, to, the, persians, as, a, result, the, persians, spent, 493, bc, reducing, the, cities, along, the, west, coast, that, still, held, out, against, them, before, finally, imposing, a, peace, settlement, on, ionia, that, was, considered, to, be, both, just, and, fair, the, ionian, revolt, constituted, the, first, major, conflict, between, greece, and, the, achaemenid, empire, and, represents, the, first, phase, of, the, greco, persian, wars, asia, minor, had, been, brought, back, into, the, persian, fold, but, darius, had, vowed, to, punish, athens, and, eretria, for, their, support, for, the, revolt, moreover, seeing, that, the, political, situation, in, greece, posed, a, continued, threat, to, the, stability, of, his, empire, he, decided, to, embark, on, the, conquest, of, all, greece, after, having, reconquered, ionia, the, persians, began, to, plan, their, next, moves, of, extinguishing, the, threat, to, their, empire, from, greece, and, punishing, athens, and, eretria, the, resultant, first, persian, invasion, of, greece, consisted, of, two, main, campaigns, the, first, campaign, in, 492, bc, was, led, by, darius, s, son, in, law, mardonius, who, re, subjugated, thrace, which, had, nominally, been, part, of, the, persian, empire, since, 513, bc, mardonius, was, also, able, to, force, macedon, to, become, a, fully, subordinate, client, kingdom, of, persia, it, had, previously, been, a, vassal, but, retained, a, broad, degree, of, autonomy, however, further, progress, in, this, campaign, was, prevented, when, mardonius, s, fleet, was, wrecked, in, a, storm, off, the, coast, of, mount, athos, mardonius, himself, was, then, injured, in, a, raid, on, his, camp, by, a, thracian, tribe, and, after, this, he, returned, with, the, rest, of, the, expedition, to, asia, the, following, year, having, given, clear, warning, of, his, plans, darius, sent, ambassadors, to, all, the, cities, of, greece, demanding, their, submission, he, received, it, from, almost, all, of, them, except, athens, and, sparta, both, of, whom, instead, executed, the, ambassadors, with, athens, still, defiant, and, sparta, now, also, effectively, at, war, with, him, darius, ordered, a, further, military, campaign, for, the, following, year, in, 490, bc, datis, and, artaphernes, son, of, the, satrap, artaphernes, were, given, command, of, an, amphibious, invasion, force, and, set, sail, from, cilicia, the, persian, force, sailed, first, to, the, island, of, rhodes, where, a, lindian, temple, chronicle, records, that, datis, besieged, the, city, of, lindos, but, was, unsuccessful, the, fleet, sailed, next, to, naxos, to, punish, the, naxians, for, their, resistance, to, the, failed, expedition, the, persians, had, mounted, there, a, decade, earlier, many, of, the, inhabitants, fled, to, the, mountains, those, that, the, persians, caught, were, enslaved, the, persians, then, burnt, the, city, and, temples, of, the, naxians, the, fleet, then, proceeded, to, island, hop, across, the, rest, of, the, aegean, on, its, way, to, eretria, taking, hostages, and, troops, from, each, island, the, task, force, sailed, on, to, euboea, and, to, the, first, major, target, eretria, the, eretrians, made, no, attempt, to, stop, the, persians, from, landing, or, advancing, and, thus, allowed, themselves, to, be, besieged, for, six, days, the, persians, attacked, the, walls, with, losses, on, both, sides, however, on, the, seventh, day, two, reputable, eretrians, opened, the, gates, and, betrayed, the, city, to, the, persians, the, city, was, razed, and, temples, and, shrines, were, looted, and, burned, furthermore, according, to, darius, s, commands, the, persians, enslaved, all, the, remaining, townspeople, the, persian, fleet, next, headed, south, down, the, coast, of, attica, landing, at, the, bay, of, marathon, roughly, 40, kilometres, 25, mi, from, athens, under, the, guidance, of, miltiades, the, general, with, the, greatest, experience, of, fighting, the, persians, the, athenian, army, marched, to, block, the, two, exits, from, the, plain, of, marathon, stalemate, ensued, for, five, days, before, the, persians, decided, to, continue, onward, to, athens, and, began, to, load, their, troops, back, onto, the, ships, after, the, persians, had, loaded, their, cavalry, their, strongest, soldiers, on, the, ships, the, 10, 000, athenian, soldiers, descended, from, the, hills, around, the, plain, the, greeks, crushed, the, weaker, persian, foot, soldiers, by, routing, the, wings, before, turning, towards, the, centre, of, the, persian, line, the, remnants, of, the, persian, army, fled, to, their, ships, and, left, the, battle, herodotus, records, that, 6, 400, persian, bodies, were, counted, on, the, battlefield, the, athenians, lost, only, 192, men, as, soon, as, the, persian, survivors, had, put, to, sea, the, athenians, marched, as, quickly, as, possible, to, athens, they, arrived, in, time, to, prevent, artaphernes, from, securing, a, landing, in, athens, seeing, his, opportunity, lost, artaphernes, ended, the, year, s, campaign, and, returned, to, asia, the, battle, of, marathon, was, a, watershed, in, the, greco, persian, wars, showing, the, greeks, that, the, persians, could, be, beaten, it, also, highlighted, the, superiority, of, the, more, heavily, armoured, greek, hoplites, and, showed, their, potential, when, used, wisely, after, the, failure, of, the, first, invasion, darius, began, raising, a, huge, new, army, with, which, he, intended, to, subjugate, greece, completely, however, in, 486, bc, his, egyptian, subjects, revolted, and, the, revolt, forced, an, indefinite, postponement, of, any, greek, expedition, darius, died, while, preparing, to, march, on, egypt, and, the, throne, of, persia, passed, to, his, son, xerxes, i, xerxes, crushed, the, egyptian, revolt, and, very, quickly, resumed, the, preparations, for, the, invasion, of, greece, since, this, was, to, be, a, full, scale, invasion, it, needed, longterm, planning, stockpiling, and, conscription, xerxes, decided, that, the, hellespont, would, be, bridged, to, allow, his, army, to, cross, to, europe, and, that, a, canal, should, be, dug, across, the, isthmus, of, mount, athos, a, persian, fleet, had, been, destroyed, in, 492, bc, while, rounding, this, coastline, these, were, both, feats, of, exceptional, ambition, that, would, have, been, beyond, the, capabilities, of, any, other, contemporary, state, however, the, campaign, was, delayed, by, one, year, because, of, another, revolt, in, egypt, and, babylonia, the, persians, had, the, sympathy, of, several, greek, city, states, including, argos, which, had, pledged, to, defect, when, the, persians, reached, their, borders, the, aleuadae, family, who, ruled, larissa, in, thessaly, saw, the, invasion, as, an, opportunity, to, extend, their, power, thebes, though, not, explicitly, medising, was, suspected, of, being, willing, to, aid, the, persians, once, the, invasion, force, arrived, in, 481, bc, after, roughly, four, years, of, preparation, xerxes, began, to, muster, the, troops, to, invade, europe, herodotus, gives, the, names, of, 46, nations, from, which, troops, were, drafted, the, persian, army, was, gathered, in, asia, minor, in, the, summer, and, autumn, of, 481, bc, the, armies, from, the, eastern, satrapies, were, gathered, in, kritala, cappadocia, and, were, led, by, xerxes, to, sardis, where, they, passed, the, winter, early, in, spring, it, moved, to, abydos, where, it, was, joined, with, the, armies, of, the, western, satrapies, then, the, army, that, xerxes, had, mustered, marched, towards, europe, crossing, the, hellespont, on, two, pontoon, bridges, the, numbers, of, troops, that, xerxes, mustered, for, the, second, invasion, of, greece, have, been, the, subject, of, endless, dispute, most, modern, scholars, reject, as, unrealistic, the, figures, of, 2, 5, million, given, by, herodotus, and, other, ancient, sources, because, the, victors, likely, miscalculated, or, exaggerated, the, topic, has, been, hotly, debated, but, the, consensus, revolves, around, the, figure, of, 200, 000, the, size, of, the, persian, fleet, is, also, disputed, although, perhaps, less, so, other, ancient, authors, agree, with, herodotus, number, of, 1, 207, these, numbers, are, by, ancient, standards, consistent, and, this, could, be, interpreted, that, a, number, around, 1, 200, is, correct, among, modern, scholars, some, have, accepted, this, number, although, suggesting, the, number, must, have, been, lower, by, the, battle, of, salamis, other, recent, works, on, the, persian, wars, reject, this, number, viewing, 1, 207, as, more, of, a, reference, to, the, combined, greek, fleet, in, the, iliad, these, works, generally, claim, that, the, persians, could, have, launched, no, more, than, around, 600, warships, into, the, aegean, a, year, after, marathon, miltiades, the, hero, of, marathon, was, injured, in, a, military, campaign, to, paros, taking, advantage, of, his, incapacitation, the, powerful, alcmaeonid, family, arranged, for, him, to, be, prosecuted, for, the, failure, of, the, campaign, a, huge, fine, was, imposed, on, miltiades, for, the, crime, of, deceiving, the, athenian, people, but, he, died, weeks, later, from, his, wound, the, politician, themistocles, with, a, power, base, firmly, established, among, the, poor, filled, the, vacuum, left, by, miltiades, s, death, and, in, the, following, decade, became, the, most, influential, politician, in, athens, during, this, period, themistocles, continued, to, support, the, expansion, of, athens, naval, power, the, athenians, were, aware, throughout, this, period, that, the, persian, interest, in, greece, had, not, ended, and, themistocles, s, naval, policies, may, be, seen, in, the, light, of, the, potential, threat, from, persia, aristides, themistocles, s, great, rival, and, champion, of, the, zeugites, the, upper, hoplite, class, vigorously, opposed, such, a, policy, in, 483, bc, a, vast, new, seam, of, silver, was, found, in, the, athenian, mines, at, laurium, themistocles, proposed, that, the, silver, should, be, used, to, build, a, new, fleet, of, triremes, ostensibly, to, assist, in, a, long, running, war, with, aegina, plutarch, suggests, that, themistocles, deliberately, avoided, mentioning, persia, believing, that, it, was, too, distant, a, threat, for, the, athenians, to, act, on, but, that, countering, persia, was, the, fleet, s, aim, fine, suggests, that, many, athenians, must, have, admitted, that, such, a, fleet, would, be, needed, to, resist, the, persians, whose, preparations, for, the, coming, campaign, were, known, themistocles, s, motion, was, passed, easily, despite, strong, opposition, from, aristides, its, passage, was, probably, due, to, the, desire, of, many, of, the, poorer, athenians, for, paid, employment, as, rowers, in, the, fleet, it, is, unclear, from, the, ancient, sources, whether, 100, or, 200, ships, were, initially, authorised, both, fine, and, holland, suggest, that, at, first, 100, ships, were, authorised, and, that, a, second, vote, increased, this, number, to, the, levels, seen, during, the, second, invasion, aristides, continued, to, oppose, themistocles, s, policy, and, tension, between, the, two, camps, built, over, the, winter, so, the, ostracism, of, 482, bc, became, a, direct, contest, between, themistocles, and, aristides, in, what, holland, characterises, as, in, essence, the, world, s, first, referendum, aristides, was, ostracised, and, themistocles, s, policies, were, endorsed, indeed, becoming, aware, of, the, persian, preparations, for, the, coming, invasion, the, athenians, voted, to, build, more, ships, than, those, for, which, themistocles, had, asked, thus, during, the, preparations, for, the, persian, invasion, themistocles, had, become, the, leading, politician, in, athens, the, spartan, king, demaratus, had, been, stripped, of, his, kingship, in, 491, bc, and, replaced, with, his, cousin, leotychides, sometime, after, 490, bc, the, humiliated, demaratus, had, chosen, to, go, into, exile, and, had, made, his, way, to, darius, s, court, in, susa, demaratus, would, from, then, on, act, as, an, advisor, to, darius, and, later, xerxes, on, greek, affairs, and, accompanied, xerxes, during, the, second, persian, invasion, at, the, end, of, herodotus, s, book, 7, there, is, an, anecdote, relating, that, prior, to, the, second, invasion, demaratus, sent, an, apparently, blank, wax, tablet, to, sparta, when, the, wax, was, removed, a, message, was, found, scratched, on, the, wooden, backing, warning, the, spartans, of, xerxes, s, plans, however, many, historians, believe, that, this, chapter, was, inserted, into, the, text, by, a, later, author, possibly, to, fill, a, gap, between, the, end, of, book, 7, and, the, start, of, book, 8, the, veracity, of, this, anecdote, is, therefore, unclear, in, 481, bc, xerxes, sent, ambassadors, to, city, states, throughout, greece, asking, for, food, land, and, water, as, tokens, of, their, submission, to, persia, however, xerxes, ambassadors, deliberately, avoided, athens, and, sparta, hoping, thereby, that, those, states, would, not, learn, of, the, persians, plans, states, that, were, opposed, to, persia, thus, began, to, coalesce, around, these, two, city, states, a, congress, of, states, met, at, corinth, in, late, autumn, of, 481, bc, and, a, confederate, alliance, of, greek, city, states, was, formed, this, confederation, had, powers, both, to, send, envoys, to, ask, for, assistance, and, to, dispatch, troops, from, the, member, states, to, defensive, points, after, joint, consultation, herodotus, does, not, formulate, an, abstract, name, for, the, union, but, simply, calls, them, the, greeks, and, the, greeks, who, had, sworn, alliance, godley, translation, or, the, greeks, who, had, banded, themselves, together, rawlinson, translation, from, here, on, they, will, be, referred, to, in, this, article, as, the, allies, sparta, and, athens, had, a, leading, role, in, the, congress, but, the, interests, of, all, the, states, influenced, defensive, strategy, little, is, known, about, the, internal, workings, of, the, congress, or, the, discussions, during, its, meetings, only, 70, of, the, nearly, 700, greek, city, states, sent, representatives, nevertheless, this, was, remarkable, for, the, disjointed, greek, world, especially, since, many, of, the, city, states, present, were, still, technically, at, war, with, one, another, having, crossed, into, europe, in, april, 480, bc, the, persian, army, began, its, march, to, greece, taking, 3, months, to, travel, unopposed, from, the, hellespont, to, therme, it, paused, at, doriskos, where, it, was, joined, by, the, fleet, xerxes, reorganized, the, troops, into, tactical, units, replacing, the, national, formations, used, earlier, for, the, march, the, allied, congress, met, again, in, the, spring, of, 480, bc, and, agreed, to, defend, the, narrow, vale, of, tempe, on, the, borders, of, thessaly, and, block, xerxes, s, advance, however, once, there, they, were, warned, by, alexander, i, of, macedon, that, the, vale, could, be, bypassed, and, that, the, army, of, xerxes, was, overwhelmingly, large, thus, the, greeks, retreated, shortly, afterwards, they, received, the, news, that, xerxes, had, crossed, the, hellespont, at, this, point, a, second, strategy, was, suggested, by, themistocles, to, the, allies, the, route, to, southern, greece, boeotia, attica, and, the, peloponnesus, would, require, the, army, of, xerxes, to, travel, through, the, narrow, pass, of, thermopylae, this, could, easily, be, blocked, by, the, greek, hoplites, despite, the, overwhelming, numbers, of, persians, furthermore, to, prevent, the, persians, bypassing, thermopylae, by, sea, the, athenian, and, allied, navies, could, block, the, straits, of, artemisium, this, dual, strategy, was, adopted, by, the, congress, however, the, peloponnesian, cities, made, fall, back, plans, to, defend, the, isthmus, of, corinth, should, it, come, to, it, while, the, women, and, children, of, athens, were, evacuated, to, the, peloponnesian, city, of, troezen, xerxes, s, estimated, time, of, arrival, at, thermopylae, coincided, with, both, the, olympic, games, and, the, festival, of, carneia, for, the, spartans, warfare, during, these, periods, was, considered, sacrilegious, despite, the, uncomfortable, timing, the, spartans, considered, the, threat, so, grave, that, they, dispatched, their, king, leonidas, i, with, his, personal, bodyguard, the, hippeis, of, 300, men, the, customary, elite, young, men, in, the, hippeis, were, replaced, by, veterans, who, already, had, children, leonidas, was, supported, by, contingents, from, the, allied, peloponnesian, cities, and, other, forces, that, the, allies, picked, up, on, the, way, to, thermopylae, the, allies, proceeded, to, occupy, the, pass, rebuilt, the, wall, the, phocians, had, built, at, the, narrowest, point, of, the, pass, and, waited, for, xerxes, s, arrival, when, the, persians, arrived, at, thermopylae, in, mid, august, they, initially, waited, for, three, days, for, the, allies, to, disperse, when, xerxes, was, eventually, persuaded, that, the, allies, intended, to, contest, the, pass, he, sent, his, troops, to, attack, however, the, allied, position, was, ideally, suited, to, hoplite, warfare, the, persian, contingents, being, forced, to, attack, the, greek, phalanx, head, on, the, allies, withstood, two, full, days, of, persian, attacks, including, those, by, the, elite, persian, immortals, however, towards, the, end, of, the, second, day, they, were, betrayed, by, a, local, resident, named, ephialtes, who, revealed, to, xerxes, a, mountain, path, that, led, behind, the, allied, lines, according, to, herodotus, herodotus, has, often, been, dismissed, as, a, story, teller, by, aristotle, himself, among, others, and, this, may, be, a, piece, of, folklore, to, create, a, more, engaging, narrative, in, any, case, it, is, impossible, to, determine, with, absolute, certainty, the, legitimacy, of, ephialtes, involvement, in, the, battle, the, anopoea, path, was, defended, by, roughly, 1000, phocians, according, to, herodotus, who, reportedly, fled, when, confronted, by, the, persians, made, aware, by, scouts, that, they, were, being, outflanked, leonidas, dismissed, most, of, the, allied, army, remaining, to, guard, the, rear, with, perhaps, 2, 000, men, on, the, final, day, of, the, battle, the, remaining, allies, sallied, forth, from, the, wall, to, meet, the, persians, in, the, wider, part, of, the, pass, to, slaughter, as, many, persians, as, they, could, but, eventually, they, were, all, killed, or, captured, simultaneous, with, the, battle, at, thermopylae, an, allied, naval, force, of, 271, triremes, defended, the, straits, of, artemisium, against, the, persians, thus, protecting, the, flank, of, the, forces, at, thermopylae, here, the, allied, fleet, held, off, the, persians, for, three, days, however, on, the, third, evening, the, allies, received, news, of, the, fate, of, leonidas, and, the, allied, troops, at, thermopylae, since, the, allied, fleet, was, badly, damaged, and, since, it, no, longer, needed, to, defend, the, flank, of, thermopylae, the, allies, retreated, from, artemisium, to, the, island, of, salamis, victory, at, thermopylae, meant, that, all, boeotia, fell, to, xerxes, attica, was, then, open, to, invasion, the, remaining, population, of, athens, was, evacuated, with, the, aid, of, the, allied, fleet, to, salamis, the, peloponnesian, allies, began, to, prepare, a, defensive, line, across, the, isthmus, of, corinth, building, a, wall, and, demolishing, the, road, from, megara, abandoning, athens, to, the, persians, athens, thus, fell, to, the, persians, the, small, number, of, athenians, who, had, barricaded, themselves, on, the, acropolis, were, eventually, defeated, and, xerxes, then, ordered, the, destruction, of, athens, the, persians, had, now, captured, most, of, greece, but, xerxes, had, perhaps, not, expected, such, defiance, his, priority, was, now, to, complete, the, war, as, quickly, as, possible, if, xerxes, could, destroy, the, allied, navy, he, would, be, in, a, strong, position, to, force, an, allied, surrender, conversely, by, avoiding, destruction, or, as, themistocles, hoped, by, destroying, the, persian, fleet, the, allies, could, prevent, conquest, from, being, completed, the, allied, fleet, thus, remained, off, the, coast, of, salamis, into, september, despite, the, imminent, arrival, of, the, persians, even, after, athens, fell, the, allied, fleet, remained, off, the, coast, of, salamis, trying, to, lure, the, persian, fleet, to, battle, partly, because, of, deception, by, themistocles, the, navies, met, in, the, cramped, straits, of, salamis, there, the, persian, numbers, became, a, hindrance, as, ships, struggled, to, maneuver, and, became, disorganised, seizing, the, opportunity, the, allied, fleet, attacked, and, scored, a, decisive, victory, sinking, or, capturing, at, least, 200, persian, ships, therefore, ensuring, the, safety, of, the, peloponnessus, according, to, herodotus, after, the, loss, of, the, battle, xerxes, attempted, to, build, a, causeway, across, the, channel, to, attack, the, athenian, evacuees, on, salamis, but, this, project, was, soon, abandoned, with, the, persians, naval, superiority, removed, xerxes, feared, that, the, allies, might, sail, to, the, hellespont, and, destroy, the, pontoon, bridges, his, general, mardonius, volunteered, to, remain, in, greece, and, complete, the, conquest, with, a, hand, picked, group, of, troops, while, xerxes, retreated, to, asia, with, the, bulk, of, the, army, mardonius, over, wintered, in, boeotia, and, thessaly, the, athenians, were, thus, able, to, return, to, their, burnt, out, city, for, the, winter, over, the, winter, there, was, some, tension, among, the, allies, in, particular, the, athenians, who, were, not, protected, by, the, isthmus, but, whose, fleet, was, the, key, to, the, security, of, the, peloponnesus, felt, that, they, had, been, treated, unfairly, and, so, they, refused, to, join, the, allied, navy, in, the, spring, mardonius, remained, in, thessaly, knowing, an, attack, on, the, isthmus, was, pointless, while, the, allies, refused, to, send, an, army, outside, the, peloponessus, mardonius, moved, to, break, the, stalemate, by, offering, peace, to, the, athenians, using, alexander, i, of, macedon, as, an, intermediate, the, athenians, made, sure, that, a, spartan, delegation, was, on, hand, to, hear, the, athenians, reject, the, persians, offer, athens, was, thus, evacuated, again, and, the, persians, marched, south, and, re, took, possession, of, it, mardonius, now, repeated, his, offer, of, peace, to, the, athenian, refugees, on, salamis, athens, with, megara, and, plataea, sent, emissaries, to, sparta, demanding, assistance, and, threatening, to, accept, the, persian, terms, if, they, were, not, aided, in, response, the, spartans, summoned, a, large, army, from, the, peloponnese, cities, and, marched, to, meet, the, persians, when, mardonius, heard, the, allied, army, was, on, the, march, he, retreated, into, boeotia, near, plataea, trying, to, draw, the, allies, into, open, terrain, where, he, could, use, his, cavalry, the, allied, army, under, the, command, of, the, regent, pausanias, stayed, on, high, ground, above, plataea, to, protect, themselves, against, such, tactics, after, several, days, of, maneuver, and, stalemate, pausanias, ordered, a, night, time, retreat, towards, the, allies, original, positions, this, maneuver, went, awry, leaving, the, athenians, and, spartans, and, tegeans, isolated, on, separate, hills, with, the, other, contingents, scattered, further, away, near, plataea, seeing, that, the, persians, might, never, have, a, better, opportunity, to, attack, mardonius, ordered, his, whole, army, forward, however, the, persian, infantry, proved, no, match, for, the, heavily, armoured, greek, hoplites, and, the, spartans, broke, through, to, mardonius, s, bodyguard, and, killed, him, after, this, the, persian, force, dissolved, in, rout, 40, 000, troops, managed, to, escape, via, the, road, to, thessaly, but, the, rest, fled, to, the, persian, camp, where, they, were, trapped, and, slaughtered, by, the, greeks, finalising, the, greek, victory, herodotus, recounts, that, on, the, afternoon, of, the, battle, of, plataea, a, rumour, of, their, victory, at, that, battle, reached, the, allies, navy, at, that, time, off, the, coast, of, mount, mycale, in, ionia, their, morale, boosted, the, allied, marines, fought, and, won, a, decisive, victory, at, the, battle, of, mycale, that, same, day, destroying, the, remnants, of, the, persian, fleet, crippling, xerxes, s, sea, power, and, marking, the, ascendancy, of, the, greek, fleet, while, many, modern, historians, doubt, that, mycale, took, place, on, the, same, day, as, plataea, the, battle, may, well, only, have, occurred, once, the, allies, received, news, of, the, events, unfolding, in, greece, mycale, was, in, many, ways, the, beginning, of, a, new, phase, in, the, conflict, in, which, the, greeks, would, go, on, the, offensive, against, the, persians, the, immediate, result, of, the, victory, at, mycale, was, a, second, revolt, among, the, greek, cities, of, asia, minor, the, samians, and, milesians, had, actively, fought, against, the, persians, at, mycale, thus, openly, declaring, their, rebellion, and, the, other, cities, followed, in, their, example, shortly, after, mycale, the, allied, fleet, sailed, to, the, hellespont, to, break, down, the, pontoon, bridges, but, found, that, this, had, already, been, done, the, peloponnesians, sailed, home, but, the, athenians, remained, to, attack, the, chersonesos, still, held, by, the, persians, the, persians, and, their, allies, made, for, sestos, the, strongest, town, in, the, region, among, them, was, one, oeobazus, of, cardia, who, had, with, him, the, cables, and, other, equipment, from, the, pontoon, bridges, the, persian, governor, artayctes, had, not, prepared, for, a, siege, not, believing, that, the, allies, would, attack, the, athenians, therefore, were, able, to, lay, a, siege, around, sestos, the, siege, dragged, on, for, several, months, causing, some, discontent, among, the, athenian, troops, but, eventually, when, the, food, ran, out, in, the, city, the, persians, fled, at, night, from, the, least, guarded, area, of, the, city, the, athenians, were, thus, able, to, take, possession, of, the, city, the, next, day, most, of, the, athenian, troops, were, sent, straight, away, to, pursue, the, persians, the, party, of, oeobazus, was, captured, by, a, thracian, tribe, and, oeobazus, was, sacrificed, to, the, god, plistorus, the, athenians, eventually, caught, artayctes, killing, some, of, the, persians, with, him, but, taking, most, of, them, including, artayctes, captive, artayctes, was, crucified, at, the, request, of, the, people, of, elaeus, a, town, which, artayctes, had, plundered, while, governor, of, the, chersonesos, the, athenians, having, pacified, the, region, then, sailed, back, to, athens, taking, the, cables, from, the, pontoon, bridges, with, them, as, trophies, in, 478, bc, still, operating, under, the, terms, of, the, hellenic, alliance, the, allies, sent, out, a, fleet, composed, of, 20, peloponnesian, and, 30, athenian, ships, supported, by, an, unspecified, number, of, allies, under, the, overall, command, of, pausanias, according, to, thucydides, this, fleet, sailed, to, cyprus, and, subdued, most, of, the, island, exactly, what, thucydides, means, by, this, is, unclear, sealey, suggests, that, this, was, essentially, a, raid, to, gather, as, much, treasure, as, possible, from, the, persian, garrisons, on, cyprus, there, is, no, indication, that, the, allies, attempted, to, take, possession, of, the, island, and, shortly, after, they, sailed, to, byzantium, certainly, the, fact, that, the, delian, league, repeatedly, campaigned, in, cyprus, suggests, either, that, the, island, was, not, garrisoned, by, the, allies, in, 478, bc, or, that, the, garrisons, were, quickly, expelled, the, greek, fleet, then, sailed, to, byzantium, which, they, besieged, and, eventually, captured, control, of, both, sestos, and, byzantium, gave, the, allies, command, of, the, straits, between, europe, and, asia, over, which, the, persians, had, crossed, and, allowed, them, access, to, the, merchant, trade, of, the, black, sea, the, aftermath, of, the, siege, was, to, prove, troublesome, for, pausanias, the, regent, exactly, what, happened, is, unclear, thucydides, gives, few, details, although, later, writers, added, plenty, of, lurid, insinuations, through, his, arrogance, and, arbitrary, actions, thucydides, says, violence, pausanias, managed, to, alienate, many, of, the, allied, contingents, particularly, those, that, had, just, been, freed, from, persian, overlordship, the, ionians, and, others, asked, the, athenians, to, take, leadership, of, the, campaign, to, which, they, agreed, the, spartans, hearing, of, his, behaviour, recalled, pausanias, and, tried, him, on, charges, of, collaborating, with, the, enemy, although, he, was, acquitted, his, reputation, was, tarnished, and, he, was, not, restored, to, his, command, pausanias, returned, to, byzantium, as, a, private, citizen, in, 477, bc, and, took, command, of, the, city, until, he, was, expelled, by, the, athenians, he, then, crossed, the, bosporus, and, settled, in, kolonai, in, the, troad, until, he, was, again, accused, of, collaborating, with, the, persians, and, was, recalled, by, the, spartans, for, a, trial, after, which, he, starved, himself, to, death, the, timescale, is, unclear, but, pausanias, may, have, remained, in, possession, of, byzantium, until, 470, bc, in, the, meantime, the, spartans, had, sent, dorkis, to, byzantium, with, a, small, force, to, take, command, of, the, allied, force, however, he, found, that, the, rest, of, the, allies, were, no, longer, prepared, to, accept, spartan, leadership, and, therefore, returned, home, after, byzantium, the, spartans, were, allegedly, eager, to, end, their, involvement, in, the, war, the, spartans, were, supposedly, of, the, view, that, with, the, liberation, of, mainland, greece, and, the, greek, cities, of, asia, minor, the, war, s, purpose, had, already, been, reached, there, was, also, perhaps, a, feeling, that, securing, long, term, security, for, the, asian, greeks, would, prove, impossible, in, the, aftermath, of, mycale, the, spartan, king, leotychides, had, proposed, transplanting, all, the, greeks, from, asia, minor, to, europe, as, the, only, method, of, permanently, freeing, them, from, persian, dominion, xanthippus, the, athenian, commander, at, mycale, had, furiously, rejected, this, the, ionian, cities, were, originally, athenian, colonies, and, the, athenians, if, no, one, else, would, protect, the, ionians, this, marks, the, point, at, which, the, leadership, of, the, greek, alliance, effectively, passed, to, the, athenians, with, the, spartan, withdrawal, after, byzantium, the, leadership, of, the, athenians, became, explicit, the, loose, alliance, of, city, states, that, had, fought, against, xerxes, s, invasion, had, been, dominated, by, sparta, and, the, peloponnesian, league, with, the, withdrawal, of, these, states, a, congress, was, called, on, the, holy, island, of, delos, to, institute, a, new, alliance, to, continue, the, fight, against, the, persians, this, alliance, now, including, many, of, the, aegean, islands, was, formally, constituted, as, the, first, athenian, alliance, commonly, known, as, the, delian, league, according, to, thucydides, the, official, aim, of, the, league, was, to, avenge, the, wrongs, they, suffered, by, ravaging, the, territory, of, the, king, in, reality, this, goal, was, divided, into, three, main, efforts, to, prepare, for, future, invasion, to, seek, revenge, against, persia, and, to, organize, a, means, of, dividing, spoils, of, war, the, members, were, given, a, choice, of, either, supplying, armed, forces, or, paying, a, tax, to, the, joint, treasury, most, states, chose, the, tax, throughout, the, 470s, bc, the, delian, league, campaigned, in, thrace, and, the, aegean, to, remove, the, remaining, persian, garrisons, from, the, region, primarily, under, the, command, of, the, athenian, politician, cimon, in, the, early, part, of, the, next, decade, cimon, began, campaigning, in, asia, minor, seeking, to, strengthen, the, greek, position, there, at, the, battle, of, the, eurymedon, in, pamphylia, the, athenians, and, allied, fleet, achieved, a, stunning, double, victory, destroying, a, persian, fleet, and, then, landing, the, ships, marines, to, attack, and, rout, the, persian, army, after, this, battle, the, persians, took, an, essentially, passive, role, in, the, conflict, anxious, not, to, risk, battle, if, possible, towards, the, end, of, the, 460s, bc, the, athenians, took, the, ambitious, decision, to, support, a, revolt, in, the, egyptian, satrapy, of, the, persian, empire, although, the, greek, task, force, achieved, initial, successes, they, were, unable, to, capture, the, persian, garrison, in, memphis, despite, a, three, year, long, siege, the, persians, then, counterattacked, and, the, athenian, force, was, itself, besieged, for, 18, months, before, being, wiped, out, this, disaster, coupled, with, ongoing, warfare, in, greece, dissuaded, the, athenians, from, resuming, conflict, with, persia, in, 451, bc, however, a, truce, was, agreed, in, greece, and, cimon, was, then, able, to, lead, an, expedition, to, cyprus, however, while, besieging, kition, cimon, died, and, the, athenian, force, decided, to, withdraw, winning, another, double, victory, at, the, battle, of, salamis, in, cyprus, to, extricate, themselves, this, campaign, marked, the, end, of, hostilities, between, the, delian, league, and, persia, and, therefore, the, end, of, the, greco, persian, wars, after, the, battle, of, salamis, in, cyprus, thucydides, makes, no, further, mention, of, conflict, with, the, persians, saying, that, the, greeks, simply, returned, home, diodorus, on, the, other, hand, claims, that, in, the, aftermath, of, salamis, a, proper, peace, treaty, the, peace, of, callias, was, agreed, with, the, persians, diodorus, was, probably, following, the, history, of, ephorus, at, this, point, who, in, turn, was, presumably, influenced, by, his, teacher, isocrates, from, whom, there, is, the, earliest, reference, to, the, supposed, peace, in, 380, bc, even, during, the, 4th, century, bc, the, idea, of, the, treaty, was, controversial, and, two, authors, from, that, period, callisthenes, and, theopompus, appear, to, reject, its, existence, it, is, possible, that, the, athenians, had, attempted, to, negotiate, with, the, persians, previously, plutarch, suggests, that, in, the, aftermath, of, the, victory, at, the, eurymedon, artaxerxes, had, agreed, to, a, peace, treaty, with, the, greeks, even, naming, callias, as, the, athenian, ambassador, involved, however, as, plutarch, admits, callisthenes, denied, that, such, a, peace, was, made, at, this, point, c, 466, bc, herodotus, also, mentions, in, passing, an, athenian, embassy, headed, by, callias, which, was, sent, to, susa, to, negotiate, with, artaxerxes, this, embassy, included, some, argive, representatives, and, can, probably, be, therefore, dated, to, c, 461, bc, after, an, alliance, was, agreed, between, athens, and, argos, this, embassy, may, have, been, an, attempt, to, reach, some, kind, of, peace, agreement, and, it, has, even, been, suggested, that, the, failure, of, these, hypothetical, negotiations, led, to, the, athenian, decision, to, support, the, egyptian, revolt, the, ancient, sources, therefore, disagree, as, to, whether, there, was, an, official, peace, or, not, and, if, there, was, when, it, was, agreed, opinion, among, modern, historians, is, also, split, for, instance, fine, accepts, the, concept, of, the, peace, of, callias, whereas, sealey, effectively, rejects, it, holland, accepts, that, some, kind, of, accommodation, was, made, between, athens, and, persia, but, no, actual, treaty, fine, argues, that, callisthenes, s, denial, that, a, treaty, was, made, after, the, eurymedon, does, not, preclude, a, peace, being, made, at, another, point, further, he, suggests, that, theopompus, was, actually, referring, to, a, treaty, that, had, allegedly, been, negotiated, with, persia, in, 423, bc, if, these, views, are, correct, it, would, remove, one, major, obstacle, to, the, acceptance, of, the, treaty, s, existence, a, further, argument, for, the, existence, of, the, treaty, is, the, sudden, withdrawal, of, the, athenians, from, cyprus, in, 449, bc, which, fine, suggests, makes, most, sense, in, the, light, of, some, kind, of, peace, agreement, on, the, other, hand, if, there, was, indeed, some, kind, of, accommodation, thucydides, s, failure, to, mention, it, is, odd, in, his, digression, on, the, pentekontaetia, his, aim, is, to, explain, the, growth, of, athenian, power, and, such, a, treaty, and, the, fact, that, the, delian, allies, were, not, released, from, their, obligations, after, it, would, have, marked, a, major, step, in, the, athenian, ascendancy, conversely, it, has, been, suggested, that, certain, passages, elsewhere, in, thucydides, s, history, are, best, interpreted, as, referring, to, a, peace, agreement, there, is, thus, no, clear, consensus, among, modern, historians, as, to, the, treaty, s, existence, the, ancient, sources, that, give, details, of, the, treaty, are, reasonably, consistent, in, their, description, of, the, terms, from, the, persian, perspective, such, terms, would, not, be, so, humiliating, as, they, might, at, first, seem, the, persians, already, agreed, that, the, greek, cities, of, asia, would, remain, governed, under, their, own, laws, under, the, reorganization, conducted, by, artaphernes, following, the, ionian, revolt, by, these, terms, the, ionians, were, still, persian, subjects, as, they, had, been, furthermore, athens, had, already, demonstrated, their, superiority, at, sea, at, the, eurymedon, and, salamis, in, cyprus, so, any, legal, limitations, for, the, persian, fleet, were, nothing, more, than, de, jure, recognition, of, military, realities, in, exchange, for, limiting, the, movement, of, persian, troops, in, one, region, of, the, realm, artaxerxes, secured, a, promise, from, the, athenians, to, stay, out, of, his, entire, realm, towards, the, end, of, the, conflict, with, persia, the, process, by, which, the, delian, league, became, the, athenian, empire, reached, its, conclusion, the, allies, of, athens, were, not, released, from, their, obligations, to, provide, either, money, or, ships, despite, the, cessation, of, hostilities, in, greece, the, first, peloponnesian, war, between, the, power, blocs, of, athens, and, sparta, which, had, continued, on, off, since, 460, bc, finally, ended, in, 445, bc, with, the, agreement, of, a, thirty, year, truce, however, the, growing, enmity, between, sparta, and, athens, would, lead, just, 14, years, later, into, the, outbreak, of, the, second, peloponnesian, war, this, disastrous, conflict, which, dragged, on, for, 27, years, would, eventually, result, in, the, utter, destruction, of, athenian, power, the, dismemberment, of, the, athenian, empire, and, the, establishment, of, a, spartan, hegemony, over, greece, however, not, just, athens, suffered, the, conflict, would, significantly, weaken, the, whole, of, greece, repeatedly, defeated, in, battle, by, the, greeks, and, plagued, by, internal, rebellions, that, hindered, their, ability, to, fight, the, greeks, after, 449, bc, artaxerxes, i, and, his, successors, instead, adopted, a, policy, of, divide, and, rule, avoiding, fighting, the, greeks, themselves, the, persians, instead, attempted, to, set, athens, against, sparta, regularly, bribing, politicians, to, achieve, their, aims, in, this, way, they, ensured, that, the, greeks, remained, distracted, by, internal, conflicts, and, were, unable, to, turn, their, attentions, to, persia, there, was, no, open, conflict, between, the, greeks, and, persia, until, 396, bc, when, the, spartan, king, agesilaus, briefly, invaded, asia, minor, as, plutarch, points, out, the, greeks, were, far, too, busy, overseeing, the, destruction, of, their, own, power, to, fight, against, the, barbarians, if, the, wars, of, the, delian, league, shifted, the, balance, of, power, between, greece, and, persia, in, favour, of, the, greeks, then, the, subsequent, half, century, of, internecine, conflict, in, greece, did, much, to, restore, the, balance, of, power, to, persia, the, persians, entered, the, peloponnesian, war, in, 411, bc, forming, a, mutual, defence, pact, with, sparta, and, combining, their, naval, resources, against, athens, in, exchange, for, sole, persian, control, of, ionia, in, 404, bc, when, cyrus, the, younger, attempted, to, seize, the, persian, throne, he, recruited, 13, 000, greek, mercenaries, from, all, over, the, greek, world, of, which, sparta, sent, 700, 800, believing, they, were, following, the, terms, of, the, defence, pact, and, unaware, of, the, army, s, true, purpose, after, the, failure, of, cyrus, persia, tried, to, regain, control, of, the, ionian, city, states, which, had, rebelled, during, the, conflict, the, ionians, refused, to, capitulate, and, called, upon, sparta, for, assistance, which, she, provided, in, 396, 395, bc, athens, however, sided, with, the, persians, which, led, in, turn, to, another, large, scale, conflict, in, greece, the, corinthian, war, towards, the, end, of, that, conflict, in, 387, bc, sparta, sought, the, aid, of, persia, to, shore, up, her, position, under, the, so, called, king, s, peace, that, brought, the, war, to, an, end, artaxerxes, ii, demanded, and, received, the, return, of, the, cities, of, asia, minor, from, the, spartans, in, return, for, which, the, persians, threatened, to, make, war, on, any, greek, state, that, did, not, make, peace, this, humiliating, treaty, which, undid, all, the, greek, gains, of, the, previous, century, sacrificed, the, greeks, of, asia, minor, so, that, the, spartans, could, maintain, their, hegemony, over, greece, it, is, in, the, aftermath, of, this, treaty, that, greek, orators, began, to, refer, to, the, peace, of, callias, whether, fictional, or, not, as, a, counterpoint, to, the, shame, of, the, king, s, peace, and, a, glorious, example, of, the, good, old, days, when, the, greeks, of, the, aegean, had, been, freed, from, persian, rule, by, the, delian, league, i, the, exact, period, covered, by, the, term, greco, persian, wars, is, open, to, interpretation, and, usage, varies, between, academics, the, ionian, revolt, and, wars, of, the, delian, league, are, sometimes, excluded, this, article, covers, the, maximum, extent, of, the, wars, ii, archaeological, evidence, for, the, panionion, before, the, 6th, century, bc, is, very, weak, and, possibly, this, temple, was, a, relatively, late, development, iii, although, historically, inaccurate, the, legend, of, a, greek, messenger, running, to, athens, with, news,
