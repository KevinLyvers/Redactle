europe, poland, and, lithuania, were, not, re, established, as, independent, countries, until, 1918, the, political, doctrine, of, the, commonwealth, was, our, state, is, a, republic, under, the, presidency, of, the, king, chancellor, jan, zamoyski, summed, up, this, doctrine, when, he, said, that, rex, regnat, et, non, gubernat, the, king, reigns, but, does, not, govern, the, commonwealth, had, a, parliament, the, sejm, as, well, as, a, senat, and, an, elected, king, pic, 1, the, king, was, obliged, to, respect, citizens, rights, specified, in, king, henry, s, articles, as, well, as, in, pacta, conventa, negotiated, at, the, time, of, his, election, the, monarch, s, power, was, limited, in, favour, of, a, sizable, noble, class, each, new, king, had, to, pledge, to, uphold, the, henrician, articles, which, were, the, basis, of, poland, s, political, system, and, included, near, unprecedented, guarantees, of, religious, tolerance, over, time, the, henrician, articles, were, merged, with, the, pacta, conventa, specific, pledges, agreed, to, by, the, king, elect, from, that, point, onwards, the, king, was, effectively, a, partner, with, the, noble, class, and, was, constantly, supervised, by, a, group, of, senators, the, sejm, could, veto, the, king, on, important, matters, including, legislation, the, adoption, of, new, laws, foreign, affairs, declaration, of, war, and, taxation, changes, of, existing, taxes, or, the, levying, of, new, ones, the, foundation, of, the, commonwealth, s, political, system, the, golden, liberty, latin, aurea, libertas, or, polish, z, ota, wolno, a, term, used, from, 1573, on, included, the, three, regions, see, below, of, the, commonwealth, enjoyed, a, degree, of, autonomy, each, voivodship, had, its, own, parliament, sejmik, which, exercised, serious, political, power, including, choice, of, pose, deputy, to, the, national, sejm, and, charging, of, the, deputy, with, specific, voting, instructions, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, had, its, own, separate, army, treasury, and, most, other, official, institutions, golden, liberty, created, a, state, that, was, unusual, for, its, time, although, somewhat, similar, political, systems, existed, in, the, contemporary, city, states, like, the, republic, of, venice, both, states, were, styled, serenissima, respublica, or, the, most, serene, republic, at, a, time, when, most, european, countries, were, headed, toward, centralization, absolute, monarchy, and, religious, and, dynastic, warfare, the, commonwealth, experimented, with, decentralization, confederation, and, federation, democracy, and, religious, tolerance, this, political, system, unusual, for, its, time, stemmed, from, the, ascendance, of, the, szlachta, noble, class, over, other, social, classes, and, over, the, political, system, of, monarchy, in, time, the, szlachta, accumulated, enough, privileges, such, as, those, established, by, the, nihil, novi, act, of, 1505, that, no, monarch, could, hope, to, break, the, szlachta, s, grip, on, power, the, commonwealth, s, political, system, is, difficult, to, fit, into, a, simple, category, but, it, can, be, tentatively, described, as, a, mixture, of, the, end, of, the, jagiellonian, dynasty, in, 1572, after, nearly, two, centuries, disrupted, the, fragile, equilibrium, of, the, commonwealth, s, government, power, increasingly, slipped, away, from, the, central, government, to, the, nobility, when, presented, with, periodic, opportunities, to, fill, the, throne, the, szlachta, exhibited, a, preference, for, foreign, candidates, who, would, not, establish, a, strong, and, long, lasting, dynasty, this, policy, often, produced, monarchs, who, were, either, totally, ineffective, or, in, constant, debilitating, conflict, with, the, nobility, furthermore, aside, from, notable, exceptions, such, as, the, able, stefan, batory, from, transylvania, 1576, 86, the, kings, of, foreign, origin, were, inclined, to, subordinate, the, interests, of, the, commonwealth, to, those, of, their, own, country, and, ruling, house, this, was, especially, visible, in, the, policies, and, actions, of, the, first, two, elected, kings, from, the, swedish, house, of, vasa, whose, politics, brought, the, commonwealth, into, conflict, with, sweden, culminating, in, the, war, known, as, the, deluge, 1655, one, of, the, events, that, mark, the, end, of, the, commonwealth, s, golden, age, and, the, beginning, of, the, commonwealth, s, decline, the, zebrzydowski, rebellion, 1606, 1607, marked, a, substantial, increase, in, the, power, of, the, polish, magnates, and, the, transformation, of, szlachta, democracy, into, magnate, oligarchy, the, commonwealth, s, political, system, was, vulnerable, to, outside, interference, as, sejm, deputies, bribed, by, foreign, powers, might, use, their, liberum, veto, to, block, attempted, reforms, this, sapped, the, commonwealth, and, plunged, it, into, political, paralysis, and, anarchy, for, over, a, century, from, the, mid, 17th, century, to, the, end, of, the, 18th, while, its, neighbours, stabilised, their, internal, affairs, and, increased, their, military, might, the, commonwealth, did, eventually, make, a, serious, effort, to, reform, its, political, system, adopting, in, 1791, the, constitution, of, 3, may, 1791, which, historian, norman, davies, calls, the, first, of, its, kind, in, europe, the, revolutionary, constitution, recast, the, erstwhile, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, as, a, polish, lithuanian, federal, state, with, a, hereditary, monarchy, and, abolished, many, of, the, deleterious, features, of, the, old, system, the, new, constitution, these, reforms, came, too, late, however, as, the, commonwealth, was, immediately, invaded, from, all, sides, by, its, neighbors, which, had, been, content, to, leave, the, commonwealth, alone, as, a, weak, buffer, state, but, reacted, strongly, to, attempts, by, king, stanis, aw, august, poniatowski, and, other, reformers, to, strengthen, the, country, russia, feared, the, revolutionary, implications, of, the, 3, may, constitution, s, political, reforms, and, the, prospect, of, the, commonwealth, regaining, its, position, as, a, european, power, catherine, the, great, regarded, the, may, constitution, as, fatal, to, her, influence, and, declared, the, polish, constitution, jacobinical, grigori, aleksandrovich, potemkin, drafted, the, act, for, the, targowica, confederation, referring, to, the, constitution, as, the, contagion, of, democratic, ideas, meanwhile, prussia, and, austria, used, it, as, a, pretext, for, further, territorial, expansion, prussian, minister, ewald, friedrich, von, hertzberg, called, the, constitution, a, blow, to, the, prussian, monarchy, fearing, that, a, strengthened, poland, would, once, again, dominate, prussia, in, the, end, the, 3, may, constitution, was, never, fully, implemented, and, the, commonwealth, entirely, ceased, to, exist, only, four, years, after, its, adoption, the, economy, of, the, commonwealth, was, predominantly, based, on, agricultural, output, and, trade, though, there, was, an, abundance, of, artisan, workshops, and, manufactories, notably, paper, mills, leather, tanneries, ironworks, glassworks, and, brickyards, some, major, cities, were, home, to, craftsmen, jewellers, and, clockmakers, the, majority, of, industries, and, trades, were, concentrated, in, the, kingdom, of, poland, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, was, more, rural, and, its, economy, was, driven, by,
