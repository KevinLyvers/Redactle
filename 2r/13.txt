https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Oceania
the, history, of, oceania, includes, the, history, of, australia, easter, island, fiji, hawaii, new, zealand, papua, new, guinea, western, new, guinea, and, other, pacific, island, nations, the, prehistory, of, oceania, is, divided, into, the, prehistory, of, each, of, its, major, areas, australia, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, and, these, vary, greatly, as, to, when, they, were, first, inhabited, by, humans, from, 70, 000, years, ago, near, oceania, to, 3, 000, years, ago, remote, oceania, indigenous, australians, are, the, original, inhabitants, of, the, australian, continent, and, nearby, islands, indigenous, australians, migrated, from, africa, to, asia, around, 70, 000, years, ago, and, arrived, in, australia, around, 50, 000, years, ago, the, torres, strait, islanders, are, indigenous, to, the, torres, strait, islands, which, are, at, the, northernmost, tip, of, queensland, near, papua, new, guinea, the, term, aboriginal, is, traditionally, applied, to, only, the, indigenous, inhabitants, of, mainland, australia, and, tasmania, along, with, some, of, the, adjacent, islands, i, e, the, first, peoples, indigenous, australians, is, an, inclusive, term, used, when, referring, to, both, aboriginal, and, torres, strait, islanders, the, earliest, definite, human, remains, found, to, date, are, that, of, mungo, man, which, have, been, dated, at, about, 40, 000, years, old, but, the, time, of, arrival, of, the, ancestors, of, indigenous, australians, is, a, matter, of, debate, among, researchers, with, estimates, dating, back, as, far, as, 125, 000, years, ago, there, is, great, diversity, among, different, indigenous, communities, and, societies, in, australia, each, with, its, own, unique, mixture, of, cultures, customs, and, languages, in, present, day, australia, these, groups, are, further, divided, into, local, communities, the, first, settlers, of, australia, new, guinea, and, the, large, islands, just, to, the, east, arrived, between, 50, 000, and, 30, 000, years, ago, when, neanderthals, still, roamed, europe, the, original, inhabitants, of, the, group, of, islands, now, named, melanesia, were, likely, the, ancestors, of, the, present, day, papuan, speaking, people, migrating, from, southeast, asia, they, appear, to, have, occupied, these, islands, as, far, east, as, the, main, islands, in, the, solomon, islands, archipelago, including, makira, and, possibly, the, smaller, islands, farther, to, the, east, particularly, along, the, north, coast, of, new, guinea, and, in, the, islands, north, and, east, of, new, guinea, the, austronesian, peoples, who, had, migrated, into, the, area, somewhat, more, than, 3, 000, years, ago, came, into, contact, with, these, pre, existing, populations, of, papuan, speaking, peoples, in, the, late, 20th, century, some, academics, proposed, a, long, period, of, interaction, that, led, to, numerous, complex, changes, in, the, peoples, genetics, languages, and, cultures, kayser, et, al, proposed, that, from, this, area, a, very, small, group, of, people, speaking, an, austronesian, language, departed, to, the, east, to, become, the, forebears, of, the, polynesian, people, however, the, theory, is, contradicted, by, the, findings, of, a, genetic, study, published, by, temple, university, in, 2008, based, on, genome, scans, and, evaluation, of, more, than, 800, genetic, markers, among, a, wide, variety, of, pacific, peoples, it, found, that, neither, polynesians, nor, micronesians, have, much, genetic, relation, to, melanesians, both, groups, are, strongly, related, genetically, to, east, asians, particularly, taiwanese, aborigines, it, appeared, that, having, developed, their, sailing, outrigger, canoes, the, polynesian, ancestors, migrated, from, east, asia, moved, through, the, melanesian, area, quickly, on, their, way, and, kept, going, to, eastern, areas, where, they, settled, they, left, little, genetic, evidence, in, melanesia, the, study, found, a, high, rate, of, genetic, differentiation, and, diversity, among, the, groups, living, within, the, melanesian, islands, with, the, peoples, distinguished, by, island, language, topography, and, geography, among, the, islands, such, diversity, developed, over, their, tens, of, thousands, of, years, of, settlement, before, the, polynesian, ancestors, ever, arrived, at, the, islands, for, instance, populations, developed, differently, in, coastal, areas, as, opposed, to, those, in, more, isolated, mountainous, valleys, additional, dna, analysis, has, taken, research, into, new, directions, as, more, human, species, have, been, discovered, since, the, late, 20th, century, based, on, his, genetic, studies, of, the, denisova, hominin, an, ancient, human, species, discovered, in, 2010, svante, p, bo, claims, that, ancient, human, ancestors, of, the, melanesians, interbred, in, asia, with, these, humans, he, has, found, that, people, of, new, guinea, share, 4, 6, of, their, genome, with, the, denisovans, indicating, this, exchange, the, denisovans, are, considered, cousin, to, the, neanderthals, both, groups, are, now, understood, to, have, migrated, out, of, africa, with, the, neanderthals, going, into, europe, and, the, denisovans, heading, east, about, 400, 000, years, ago, this, is, based, on, genetic, evidence, from, a, fossil, found, in, siberia, the, evidence, from, melanesia, suggests, their, territory, extended, into, south, asia, where, ancestors, of, the, melanesians, developed, melanesians, of, some, islands, are, one, of, the, few, non, european, peoples, and, the, only, dark, skinned, group, of, people, outside, australia, known, to, have, blond, hair, micronesia, began, to, be, settled, several, millennia, ago, although, there, are, competing, theories, about, the, origin, and, arrival, of, the, first, settlers, there, are, numerous, difficulties, with, conducting, archaeological, excavations, in, the, islands, due, to, their, size, settlement, patterns, and, storm, damage, as, a, result, much, evidence, is, based, on, linguistic, analysis, the, earliest, archaeological, traces, of, civilization, have, been, found, on, the, island, of, saipan, dated, to, 1500, bce, or, slightly, before, the, ancestors, of, the, micronesians, settled, there, over, 4, 000, years, ago, a, decentralized, chieftain, based, system, eventually, evolved, into, a, more, centralized, economic, and, religious, culture, centered, on, yap, and, pohnpei, the, prehistory, of, many, micronesian, islands, such, as, yap, are, not, known, very, well, on, pohnpei, pre, colonial, history, is, divided, into, three, eras, mwehin, kawa, or, mwehin, aramas, period, of, building, or, period, of, peopling, before, c, 1100, mwehin, sau, deleur, period, of, the, lord, of, deleur, c, 1100, to, c, 1628, and, mwehin, nahnmwarki, period, of, the, nahnmwarki, c, 1628, to, c, 1885, pohnpeian, legend, recounts, that, the, saudeleur, rulers, the, first, to, bring, government, to, pohnpei, were, of, foreign, origin, the, saudeleur, centralized, form, of, absolute, rule, is, characterized, in, pohnpeian, legend, as, becoming, increasingly, oppressive, over, several, generations, arbitrary, and, onerous, demands, as, well, as, a, reputation, for, offending, pohnpeian, deities, sowed, resentment, among, pohnpeians, the, saudeleur, dynasty, ended, with, the, invasion, of, isokelekel, another, semi, mythical, foreigner, who, replaced, the, saudeleur, rule, with, the, more, decentralized, nahnmwarki, system, in, existence, today, isokelekel, is, regarded, as, the, creator, of, the, modern, pohnpeian, nahnmwarki, social, system, and, the, father, of, the, pompeian, people, construction, of, nan, madol, a, megalithic, complex, made, from, basalt, lava, logs, in, pohnpei, began, as, early, as, 1200, ce, nan, madol, is, offshore, of, temwen, island, near, pohnpei, consists, of, a, series, of, small, artificial, islands, linked, by, a, network, of, canals, and, is, often, called, the, venice, of, the, pacific, it, is, located, near, the, island, of, pohnpei, and, was, the, ceremonial, and, political, seat, of, the, saudeleur, dynasty, that, united, pohnpei, s, estimated, 25, 000, people, until, its, centralized, system, collapsed, amid, the, invasion, of, isokelekel, isokelekel, and, his, descendants, initially, occupied, the, stone, city, but, later, abandoned, it, the, first, people, of, the, northern, mariana, islands, navigated, to, the, islands, at, some, period, between, 4000, bce, to, 2000, bce, from, southeast, asia, they, became, known, as, the, chamorros, and, spoke, an, austronesian, language, called, chamorro, the, ancient, chamorro, left, a, number, of, megalithic, ruins, including, latte, stone, the, refaluwasch, or, carolinian, people, came, to, the, marianas, in, the, 1800s, from, the, caroline, islands, micronesian, colonists, gradually, settled, the, marshall, islands, during, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, with, inter, island, navigation, made, possible, using, traditional, stick, charts, linguistic, archaeological, and, human, genetic, evidence, identifies, the, polynesians, as, a, subset, of, the, sea, migrating, austronesian, peoples, and, tracing, polynesian, languages, places, their, prehistoric, origins, in, the, malay, archipelago, and, ultimately, in, taiwan, between, about, 3000, and, 1000, bce, speakers, of, austronesian, languages, began, spreading, from, taiwan, into, maritime, southeast, asia, as, tribes, thought, to, have, travelled, via, south, china, about, 8, 000, years, ago, to, the, edges, of, western, micronesia, and, on, into, melanesia, although, they, differ, from, the, han, chinese, who, now, comprise, the, majority, of, people, in, china, and, taiwan, there, are, three, theories, regarding, the, prehistoric, spread, of, humans, across, the, pacific, to, polynesia, kayser, et, al, 2000, outline, these, well, in, the, archaeological, record, there, are, well, defined, traces, of, this, expansion, allowing, researchers, to, follow, and, date, the, path, it, took, with, some, certainty, it, is, thought, that, by, roughly, 1400, bce, lapita, peoples, so, named, after, their, pottery, tradition, appeared, in, the, bismarck, archipelago, of, northwest, melanesia, this, culture, is, seen, as, having, adapted, and, evolved, through, time, and, space, since, its, emergence, out, of, taiwan, the, lapita, people, had, given, up, rice, production, for, instance, after, encountering, and, adapting, to, breadfruit, in, the, bird, s, head, area, of, new, guinea, in, the, end, the, most, eastern, site, for, lapita, archaeological, remains, recovered, so, far, has, been, through, work, on, the, archaeology, in, samoa, the, site, is, at, mulifanua, on, upolu, the, mulifanua, site, where, 4, 288, pottery, shards, have, been, found, and, studied, has, a, true, age, of, c, 1000, bce, based, on, c14, dating, a, 2010, study, places, the, beginning, of, the, human, archaeological, sequences, of, polynesia, in, tonga, at, 900, bce, the, small, differences, in, dates, with, samoa, being, due, to, differences, in, radiocarbon, dating, technologies, between, 1989, and, 2010, the, tongan, site, apparently, predating, the, samoan, site, by, some, few, decades, in, real, time, within, a, mere, three, or, four, centuries, between, about, 1300, and, 900, bce, the, lapita, archaeological, culture, spread, 6, 000, kilometres, eastwards, from, the, bismarck, archipelago, until, it, reached, as, far, as, fiji, tonga, and, samoa, the, area, of, tonga, fiji, and, samoa, served, as, a, gateway, into, the, rest, of, the, pacific, region, now, known, as, polynesia, ancient, tongan, mythologies, as, recorded, by, early, european, explorers, report, the, islands, of, ata, and, tongatapu, as, the, first, islands, hauled, to, the, surface, from, the, deep, ocean, by, maui, the, tu, i, tonga, empire, or, tongan, empire, in, oceania, are, descriptions, sometimes, given, to, tongan, expansionism, and, projected, hegemony, dating, back, to, 950, ce, but, at, its, peak, during, the, period, 1200, 1500, while, modern, researchers, and, cultural, experts, attest, to, widespread, tongan, influence, and, evidences, of, transoceanic, trade, and, exchange, of, material, and, non, material, cultural, artifacts, empirical, evidence, of, a, political, empire, ruled, for, any, length, of, time, by, successive, rulers, is, lacking, modern, archeology, anthropology, and, linguistic, studies, confirm, widespread, tongan, cultural, influence, ranging, widely, through, east, uvea, rotuma, futuna, samoa, and, niue, parts, of, micronesia, kiribati, pohnpei, vanuatu, and, new, caledonia, and, the, loyalty, islands, and, while, some, academics, prefer, the, term, maritime, chiefdom, others, argue, that, while, very, different, from, examples, elsewhere, empire, is, probably, the, most, convenient, term, pottery, art, from, fijian, towns, shows, that, fiji, was, settled, before, or, around, 3500, to, 1000, bc, although, the, details, of, pacific, migration, remain, vague, it, is, believed, that, the, lapita, people, or, the, ancestors, of, the, polynesians, settled, the, islands, first, but, not, much, is, known, of, what, became, of, them, after, the, melanesians, arrived, they, may, have, had, some, influence, on, the, new, culture, and, archaeological, evidence, shows, that, polynesians, would, have, then, moved, on, to, tonga, samoa, and, even, hawai, i, the, first, settlements, in, fiji, were, started, by, voyaging, traders, and, settlers, from, the, west, about, 5000, years, ago, lapita, pottery, shards, have, been, found, at, numerous, excavations, around, the, country, aspects, of, fijian, culture, are, similar, to, the, melanesian, culture, of, the, western, pacific, but, have, a, stronger, connection, to, the, older, polynesian, cultures, stretching, across, 1, 000, kilometres, 620, mi, from, east, to, west, fiji, has, been, a, nation, of, many, languages, fiji, s, history, was, one, of, settlement, but, also, of, mobility, over, the, centuries, a, unique, fijian, culture, developed, constant, warfare, and, cannibalism, between, warring, tribes, were, quite, rampant, and, very, much, part, of, everyday, life, in, later, centuries, the, reputation, of, the, cannibal, lifestyle, deterred, european, sailors, from, going, near, fijian, waters, and, fiji, acquired, the, name, cannibal, isles, as, a, result, fiji, remained, unknown, to, the, rest, of, the, world, early, european, visitors, to, easter, island, recorded, local, oral, traditions, about, the, original, settlers, in, these, traditions, easter, islanders, claimed, that, a, chief, hotu, matu, a, arrived, on, the, island, in, one, or, two, large, canoes, with, his, wife, and, extended, family, they, are, believed, to, have, been, polynesian, there, is, considerable, uncertainty, about, the, accuracy, of, this, legend, as, well, as, about, the, date, of, settlement, published, literature, suggests, the, island, was, settled, around, 300, 400, ce, or, at, about, the, time, of, the, arrival, of, the, earliest, settlers, in, hawaii, some, scientists, say, that, easter, island, was, not, inhabited, until, 700, 800, ce, this, date, range, is, based, on, glottochronological, calculations, and, on, three, radiocarbon, dates, from, charcoal, that, appears, to, have, been, produced, during, forest, clearance, activities, moreover, a, recent, study, which, included, radiocarbon, dates, from, what, is, thought, to, be, very, early, material, suggests, that, the, island, was, settled, as, recently, as, 1200, ce, this, seems, to, be, supported, by, a, 2006, study, of, the, island, s, deforestation, which, could, have, started, around, the, same, time, a, large, now, extinct, palm, paschalococos, disperta, related, to, the, chilean, wine, palm, jubaea, chilensis, was, one, of, the, dominant, trees, as, attested, by, fossil, evidence, this, species, unique, to, easter, island, became, extinct, due, to, deforestation, by, the, early, polynesian, settlers, oceania, was, first, explored, by, europeans, from, the, 16th, century, onwards, portuguese, navigators, between, 1512, and, 1526, reached, the, moluccas, by, ant, nio, de, abreu, and, francisco, serr, o, in, 1512, timor, the, aru, islands, martim, a, melo, coutinho, the, tanimbar, islands, some, of, the, caroline, islands, by, gomes, de, sequeira, in, 1525, and, west, papua, new, guinea, by, jorge, de, menezes, in, 1526, in, 1519, a, castilian, spanish, expedition, led, by, ferdinand, magellan, sailed, down, the, east, coast, of, south, america, found, and, sailed, through, the, strait, that, bears, his, name, and, on, 28, november, 1520, entered, the, ocean, which, he, named, pacific, the, three, remaining, ships, led, by, magellan, and, his, captains, duarte, barbosa, and, jo, o, serr, o, then, sailed, north, and, caught, the, trade, winds, which, carried, them, across, the, pacific, to, the, philippines, where, magellan, was, killed, one, surviving, ship, led, by, juan, sebasti, n, elcano, returned, west, across, the, indian, ocean, and, the, other, went, north, in, the, hope, of, finding, the, westerlies, and, reaching, mexico, unable, to, find, the, right, winds, it, was, forced, to, return, to, the, east, indies, the, magellan, elcano, expedition, achieved, the, first, circumnavigation, of, the, world, and, reached, the, philippines, the, mariana, islands, and, other, islands, of, oceania, from, 1527, to, 1595, a, number, of, other, large, spanish, expeditions, crossed, the, pacific, ocean, leading, to, the, discovery, of, the, marshall, islands, and, palau, in, the, north, pacific, as, well, as, tuvalu, the, marquesas, the, solomon, islands, archipelago, the, cook, islands, and, the, admiralty, islands, in, the, south, pacific, in, 1565, spanish, navigator, andr, s, de, urdaneta, found, a, wind, system, that, would, allow, ships, to, sail, eastward, from, asia, back, to, the, americas, from, then, until, 1815, the, annual, manila, galleons, crossed, the, pacific, from, mexico, to, the, philippines, and, back, in, the, first, transpacific, trade, route, in, history, combined, with, the, spanish, atlantic, or, west, indies, fleet, the, manila, galleons, formed, one, of, the, first, global, maritime, exchange, in, human, history, linking, seville, in, spain, with, manila, in, the, philippines, via, mexico, later, in, the, quest, for, terra, australis, spanish, explorers, in, the, 17th, century, discovered, the, pitcairn, and, vanuatu, archipelagos, and, sailed, the, torres, strait, between, australia, and, new, guinea, named, after, navigator, lu, s, vaz, de, torres, in, 1668, the, spaniards, founded, a, colony, on, guam, as, a, resting, place, for, west, bound, galleons, for, a, long, time, this, was, the, only, non, coastal, european, settlement, in, the, pacific, the, dutch, were, the, first, non, natives, to, undisputedly, explore, and, chart, coastlines, of, australia, tasmania, new, zealand,

netherlandish, cartography, c, 1570s, 1670s, in, the, 17th, century, the, voc, s, navigators, and, explorers, charted, almost, three, quarters, of, the, australian, coastline, except, the, east, coast, abel, tasman, was, the, first, known, european, explorer, to, reach, the, islands, of, van, diemen, s, land, now, tasmania, and, new, zealand, and, to, sight, the, fiji, islands, his, navigator, fran, ois, visscher, and, his, merchant, isaack, gilsemans, mapped, substantial, portions, of, australia, new, zealand, tonga, and, the, fijian, islands, on, 24, november, 1642, abel, tasman, sighted, the, west, coast, of, tasmania, north, of, macquarie, harbour, he, named, his, discovery, van, diemen, s, land, after, antonio, van, diemen, governor, general, of, the, dutch, east, indies, then, claimed, formal, possession, of, the, land, on, 3, december, 1642, after, some, exploration, tasman, had, intended, to, proceed, in, a, northerly, direction, but, as, the, wind, was, unfavourable, he, steered, east, on, 13, december, they, sighted, land, on, the, north, west, coast, of, the, south, island, new, zealand, becoming, the, first, europeans, to, do, so, tasman, named, it, staten, landt, on, the, assumption, that, it, was, connected, to, an, island, staten, island, argentina, at, the, south, of, the, tip, of, south, america, proceeding, north, and, then, east, he, stopped, to, gather, water, but, one, of, his, boats, was, attacked, by, m, ori, in, a, double, hulled, waka, canoes, and, four, of, his, men, were, attacked, and, killed, by, mere, as, tasman, sailed, out, of, the, bay, he, was, again, attacked, this, time, by, 11, waka, the, waka, approached, the, zeehan, which, fired, and, hit, one, m, ori, who, fell, down, canister, shot, hit, the, side, of, a, waka, archeological, research, has, shown, the, dutch, had, tried, to, land, at, a, major, agricultural, area, which, the, m, ori, may, have, been, trying, to, protect, tasman, named, the, bay, murderers, bay, now, known, as, golden, bay, and, sailed, north, but, mistook, cook, strait, for, a, bight, naming, it, zeehaen, s, bight, two, names, he, gave, to, new, zealand, landmarks, still, endure, cape, maria, van, diemen, and, three, kings, islands, but, kaap, pieter, boreels, was, renamed, by, cook, 125, years, later, to, cape, egmont, en, route, back, to, batavia, tasman, came, across, the, tongan, archipelago, on, 20, january, 1643, while, passing, the, fiji, islands, tasman, s, ships, came, close, to, being, wrecked, on, the, dangerous, reefs, of, the, north, eastern, part, of, the, fiji, group, he, charted, the, eastern, tip, of, vanua, levu, and, cikobia, before, making, his, way, back, into, the, open, sea, he, eventually, turned, north, west, to, new, guinea, and, arrived, at, batavia, on, 15, june, 1643, for, over, a, century, after, tasman, s, voyages, until, the, era, of, james, cook, tasmania, and, new, zealand, were, not, visited, by, europeans, mainland, australia, was, visited, but, usually, only, by, accident, in, 1766, the, royal, society, engaged, james, cook, to, travel, to, the, pacific, ocean, to, observe, and, record, the, transit, of, venus, across, the, sun, the, expedition, sailed, from, england, on, 26, august, 1768, rounded, cape, horn, and, continued, westward, across, the, pacific, to, arrive, at, tahiti, on, 13, april, 1769, where, the, observations, of, the, venus, transit, were, made, once, the, observations, were, completed, cook, opened, the, sealed, orders, which, were, additional, instructions, from, the, admiralty, for, the, second, part, of, his, voyage, to, search, the, south, pacific, for, signs, of, the, postulated, rich, southern, continent, of, terra, australis, with, the, help, of, a, tahitian, named, tupaia, who, had, extensive, knowledge, of, pacific, geography, cook, managed, to, reach, new, zealand, on, 6, october, 1769, leading, only, the, second, group, of, europeans, to, do, so, after, abel, tasman, over, a, century, earlier, in, 1642, cook, mapped, the, complete, new, zealand, coastline, making, only, some, minor, errors, such, as, calling, banks, peninsula, an, island, and, thinking, stewart, island, rakiura, was, a, peninsula, of, the, south, island, he, also, identified, cook, strait, which, separates, the, north, island, from, the, south, island, and, which, tasman, had, not, seen, cook, then, voyaged, west, reaching, the, south, eastern, coast, of, australia, on, 19, april, 1770, and, in, doing, so, his, expedition, became, the, first, recorded, europeans, to, have, encountered, its, eastern, coastline, on, 23, april, he, made, his, first, recorded, direct, observation, of, indigenous, australians, at, brush, island, near, bawley, point, noting, in, his, journal, and, were, so, near, the, shore, as, to, distinguish, several, people, upon, the, sea, beach, they, appear, d, to, be, of, a, very, dark, or, black, colour, but, whether, this, was, the, real, colour, of, their, skins, or, the, c, othes, they, might, have, on, i, know, not, on, 29, april, cook, and, crew, made, their, first, landfall, on, the, mainland, of, the, continent, at, a,

demonstrated, by, circumnavigating, new, zealand, that, it, was, not, attached, to, a, larger, landmass, to, the, south, although, he, charted, almost, the, entire, eastern, coastline, of, australia, showing, it, to, be, continental, in, size, the, terra, australis, was, believed, by, the, royal, society, to, lie, further, south, cook, commanded, hms, resolution, on, this, voyage, while, tobias,

on, this, leg, of, the, voyage, he, brought, a, young, tahitian, named, omai, who, proved, to, be, somewhat, less, knowledgeable, about, the, pacific, than, tupaia, had, been, on, the, first, voyage, on, his, return, voyage, to, new, zealand, in, 1774, cook, landed, at, the, friendly, islands, easter, island, norfolk, island, new, caledonia, and, vanuatu, before, returning, to, england, cook,

was, ostensibly, planned, to, return, the, pacific, islander, omai, to, tahiti, or, so, the, public, were, led, to, believe, the, trip, s, principal, goal, was, to, locate, a, north, west, passage, around, the, american, continent, after, dropping, omai, at, tahiti, cook, travelled, north, and, in, 1778, became, the, first, european, to, visit, the, hawaiian, islands, after, his, initial,

he, made, landfall, at, kealakekua, bay, on, hawaii, island, largest, island, in, the, hawaiian, archipelago, cook, s, arrival, coincided, with, the, makahiki, a, hawaiian, harvest, festival, of, worship, for, the, polynesian, god, lono, coincidentally, the, form, of, cook, s, ship, hms, resolution, or, more, particularly, the, mast, formation, sails, and, rigging, resembled, certain, significant, artefacts, that, formed, part, of, the, season, of, worship, similarly, cook, s, clockwise, route, around, the, island, of, hawaii, before, making, landfall, resembled, the, processions, that, took, place, in, a, clockwise, direction, around, the, island, during, the, lono, festivals, it, has, been, argued, most, extensively, by, marshall, sahlins, that, such, coincidences, were, the, reasons, for, cook, s, and, to, a, limited, extent, his, crew, s, initial, deification, by, some, hawaiians, who, treated, cook, as, an, incarnation, of, lono, though, this, view, was, first, suggested, by, members, of, cook, s, expedition, the, idea, that, any, hawaiians, understood, cook, to, be, lono, and, the, evidence, presented, in, support, of, it, were, challenged, in, 1992, after, a, month, s, stay, cook, resumed, his, exploration, of, the, northern, pacific, shortly, after, leaving, hawaii, island, however, the, resolution, s, foremast, broke, so, the, ships, returned, to,

one, of, cook, s, small, boats, as, thefts, were, quite, common, in, tahiti, and, the, other, islands, cook, would, have, taken, hostages, until, the, stolen, articles, were, returned, he, attempted, to, take, as, hostage, the, king, of, hawai, i, kalani, pu, u, the, hawaiians, prevented, this, and, cook, s, men, had, to, retreat, to, the, beach, as, cook, turned, his, back, to, help, launch, the, boats, he, was, struck, on, the, head, by, the, villagers, and, then, stabbed, to, death, as, he, fell, on, his, face, in, the, surf, hawaiian, tradition, says, that, he, was, killed, by, a, chief, named, kalaimanokaho, owaha, or, kana, ina, the, hawaiians, dragged, his, body, away, four, of, cook, s, men, were, also, killed, and, two, others, were, wounded, in, the, confrontation, the, esteem, which, the, islanders, nevertheless, held, for, cook, caused, them, to, retain, his, body, following, their, practice, of, the, time, they, prepared, his, body, with, funerary, rituals, usually, reserved, for, the, chiefs, and, highest, elders, of, the, society, the, body, was, disembowelled, baked, to, facilitate, removal, of, the, flesh, and, the, bones, were, carefully, cleaned, for, preservation, as, religious, icons, in, a, fashion, somewhat, reminiscent, of, the, treatment, of, european, saints, in, the, middle, ages, some, of, cook, s, remains, thus, preserved, were,
