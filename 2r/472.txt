the, yalta, conference, russian, romanized, yaltinskaya, konferentsiya, held, 4, 11, february, 1945, was, the, world, war, ii, meeting, of, the, heads, of, government, of, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, and, the, soviet, union, to, discuss, the, postwar, reorganization, of, germany, and, europe, the, three, states, were, represented, by, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, prime, minister, winston, churchill, and, general, secretary, joseph, stalin, the, conference, was, held, near, yalta, in, crimea, soviet, union, within, the, livadia, yusupov, and, vorontsov, palaces, the, aim, of, the, conference, was, to, shape, a, postwar, peace, that, represented, not, only, a, collective, security, order, but, also, a, plan, to, give, self, determination, to, the, liberated, peoples, of, europe, intended, mainly, to, discuss, the, re, establishment, of, the, nations, of, war, torn, europe, within, a, few, years, with, the, cold, war, dividing, the, continent, the, conference, became, a, subject, of, intense, controversy, yalta, was, the, second, of, three, major, wartime, conferences, among, the, big, three, it, was, preceded, by, the, tehran, conference, in, november, 1943, and, was, followed, by, the, potsdam, conference, in, july, of, the, same, year, 1945, it, was, also, preceded, by, a, conference, in, moscow, in, october, 1944, not, attended, by, roosevelt, in, which, churchill, and, stalin, had, spoken, about, western, and, soviet, spheres, of, influence, in, europe, during, the, yalta, conference, the, western, allies, had, liberated, all, of, france, and, belgium, and, were, fighting, on, the, western, border, of, germany, in, the, east, soviet, forces, were, 65, km, 40, mi, from, berlin, having, already, pushed, back, the, germans, from, poland, romania, and, bulgaria, there, was, no, longer, a, question, regarding, german, defeat, the, issue, was, the, new, shape, of, postwar, europe, the, french, leader, general, charles, de, gaulle, was, not, invited, to, either, the, yalta, or, potsdam, conferences, a, diplomatic, slight, that, was, the, occasion, for, deep, and, lasting, resentment, de, gaulle, attributed, his, exclusion, from, yalta, to, the, longstanding, personal, antagonism, towards, him, by, roosevelt, but, the, soviets, had, also, objected, to, his, inclusion, as, a, full, participant, however, the, absence, of, french, representation, at, yalta, also, meant, that, extending, an, invitation, for, de, gaulle, to, attend, the, potsdam, conference, would, have, been, highly, problematic, since, he, would, have, felt, honor, bound, to, insist, that, all, issues, agreed, at, yalta, in, his, absence, be, reopened, the, initiative, for, calling, a, second, big, three, conference, had, come, from, roosevelt, who, hoped, for, a, meeting, before, the, us, presidential, elections, in, november, 1944, but, pressed, for, a, meeting, early, in, 1945, at, a, neutral, location, in, the, mediterranean, malta, cyprus, sicily, athens, and, jerusalem, were, all, suggested, stalin, insisting, that, his, doctors, opposed, any, long, trips, rejected, those, options, he, proposed, instead, for, them, meet, at, the, black, sea, resort, of, yalta, in, the, crimea, stalin, s, fear, of, flying, also, was, a, contributing, factor, in, the, decision, each, of, the, three, leaders, had, his, own, agenda, for, postwar, germany, and, liberated, europe, roosevelt, wanted, soviet, support, in, the, pacific, war, against, japan, specifically, for, the, planned, invasion, of, japan, operation, august, storm, as, well, as, soviet, participation, in, the, united, nations, churchill, pressed, for, free, elections, and, democratic, governments, in, central, and, eastern, europe, specifically, poland, stalin, demanded, a, soviet, sphere, of, political, influence, in, eastern, and, central, europe, as, an, essential, aspect, of, the, soviets, national, security, strategy, and, his, position, at, the, conference, was, felt, by, him, to, be, so, strong, that, he, could, dictate, terms, according, to, us, delegation, member, and, future, secretary, of, state, james, f, byrnes, it, was, not, a, question, of, what, we, would, let, the, russians, do, but, what, we, could, get, the, russians, to, do, poland, was, the, first, item, on, the, soviet, agenda, stalin, stated, for, the, soviet, government, the, question, of, poland, was, one, of, honor, and, security, because, poland, had, served, as, a, historical, corridor, for, forces, attempting, to, invade, russia, in, addition, stalin, stated, regarding, history, that, because, the, russians, had, greatly, sinned, against, poland, the, soviet, government, was, trying, to, atone, for, those, sins, stalin, concluded, that, poland, must, be, strong, and, that, the, soviet, union, is, interested, in, the, creation, of, a, mighty, free, and, independent, poland, accordingly, stalin, stipulated, that, polish, government, in, exile, demands, were, not, negotiable, and, the, soviets, would, keep, the, territory, of, eastern, poland, that, they, had, annexed, in, 1939, with, poland, to, be, compensated, for, that, by, extending, its, western, borders, at, the, expense, of, germany, roosevelt, wanted, the, soviets, to, enter, the, pacific, war, against, japan, with, the, allies, which, he, hoped, would, end, the, war, sooner, and, reduce, american, casualties, one, soviet, precondition, for, a, declaration, of, war, against, japan, was, an, american, official, recognition, of, the, mongolian, independence, from, china, the, mongolian, people, s, republic, had, been, a, soviet, satellite, state, from, 1924, to, world, war, ii, the, soviets, also, wanted, the, recognition, of, soviet, interests, in, the, chinese, eastern, railway, and, port, arthur, but, not, asking, the, chinese, to, lease, the, soviets, wanted, the, return, of, south, sakhalin, which, had, been, taken, from, russia, by, japan, in, the, russo, japanese, war, in, 1905, and, the, cession, of, kuril, islands, by, japan, both, of, which, were, approved, by, truman, in, return, stalin, pledged, that, the, soviet, union, would, enter, the, pacific, war, three, months, after, the, defeat, of, germany, the, fate, of, korea, is, not, mentioned, on, the, records, of, demands, and, concessions, at, yalta, however, several, declassified, documents, later, revealed, that, on, 8, february, while, churchill, was, not, present, roosevelt, and, stalin, secretly, discussed, the, peninsula, roosevelt, brought, up, the, idea, of, putting, korea, into, a, trusteeship, divided, among, the, soviets, the, americans, and, the, chinese, for, a, period, of, 20, to, 30, years, he, expressed, reluctance, to, invite, the, british, to, the, trusteeship, but, stalin, reportedly, replied, that, the, british, would, most, certainly, be, offended, in, fact, the, prime, minister, might, kill, us, roosevelt, agreed, with, the, assessment, stalin, suggested, the, trusteeship, be, as, short, as, possible, the, two, quickly, agreed, that, their, troops, should, not, be, stationed, in, korea, korea, was, not, discussed, again, throughout, the, conference, furthermore, the, soviets, agreed, to, join, the, united, nations, because, of, a, secret, understanding, of, a, voting, formula, with, a, veto, power, for, permanent, members, of, the, security, council, which, ensured, that, each, country, could, block, unwanted, decisions, the, soviet, army, had, occupied, poland, completely, and, held, much, of, eastern, europe, with, a, military, power, three, times, greater, than, allied, forces, in, the, west, the, declaration, of, liberated, europe, did, little, to, dispel, the, sphere, of, influence, agreements, which, had, been, incorporated, into, armistice, agreements, all, three, leaders, ratified, the, agreement, of, the, european, advisory, commission, setting, the, boundaries, of, postwar, occupation, zones, for, germany, with, three, zones, of, occupation, one, for, each, of, the, three, principal, allies, they, also, agreed, to, give, france, a, zone, of, occupation, carved, out, of, the, us, and, uk, zones, but, de, gaulle, maintained, the, principle, of, refusing, to, accept, that, the, french, zone, would, be, defined, by, boundaries, established, in, his, absence, he, thus, ordered, french, forces, to, occupy, stuttgart, in, addition, to, the, lands, earlier, agreed, upon, as, comprising, the, french, occupation, zone, he, only, withdrew, when, threatened, with, the, suspension, of, essential, american, economic, supplies, churchill, at, yalta, then, argued, that, the, french, also, needed, to, be, a, full, member, of, the, proposed, allied, control, council, for, germany, stalin, resisted, that, until, roosevelt, backed, churchill, s, position, but, stalin, still, remained, adamant, that, the, french, should, not, be, admitted, to, full, membership, of, the, allied, reparations, commission, to, be, established, in, moscow, and, relented, only, at, the, potsdam, conference, also, the, big, three, agreed, that, all, original, governments, would, be, restored, to, the, invaded, countries, with, the, exceptions, of, romania, and, bulgaria, and, poland, whose, government, in, exile, was, also, excluded, by, stalin, and, that, all, of, their, civilians, would, be, repatriated, the, declaration, of, liberated, europe, was, created, by, winston, churchill, franklin, d, roosevelt, and, joseph, stalin, during, the, yalta, conference, it, was, a, promise, that, allowed, the, people, of, europe, to, create, democratic, institutions, of, their, own, choice, the, declaration, pledged, that, the, earliest, possible, establishment, through, free, elections, governments, responsive, to, the, will, of, the, people, that, is, similar, to, the, statements, of, the, atlantic, charter, for, the, right, of, all, people, to, choose, the, form, of, government, under, which, they, will, live, the, key, points, of, the, meeting, were, as, follows, the, big, three, further, agreed, that, democracies, would, be, established, all, liberated, european, and, former, axis, satellite, countries, would, hold, free, elections, and, that, order, would, be, restored, in, that, regard, they, promised, to, rebuild, occupied, countries, by, processes, that, will, allow, them, to, create, democratic, institutions, of, their, own, choice, this, is, a, principle, of, the, atlantic, charter, the, right, of, all, peoples, to, choose, the, form, of, government, under, which, they, will, live, the, resulting, report, stated, that, the, three, would, assist, occupied, countries, to, form, interim, government, that, pledged, to, the, earliest, possible, establishment, through, free, elections, of, the, governments, responsive, to, the, will, of, the, people, and, to, facilitate, where, necessary, the, holding, of, such, elections, the, agreement, called, on, signatories, to, consult, together, on, the, measures, necessary, to, discharge, the, joint, responsibilities, set, forth, in, this, declaration, during, the, yalta, discussions, molotov, inserted, language, that, weakened, the, implication, of, enforcement, of, the, declaration, regarding, poland, the, yalta, report, further, stated, that, the, provisional, government, should, be, pledged, to, the, holding, of, free, and, unfettered, elections, as, soon, as, possible, on, the, basis, of, universal, suffrage, and, secret, ballot, the, agreement, could, not, conceal, the, importance, of, acceding, to, the, pro, soviet, short, term, lublin, government, control, and, of, eliminating, language, that, called, for, supervised, elections, according, to, roosevelt, if, we, attempt, to, evade, the, fact, that, we, placed, somewhat, more, emphasis, on, the, lublin, poles, than, on, the, other, two, groups, from, which, the, new, government, is, to, be, drawn, i, feel, we, will, expose, ourselves, to, the, charges, that, we, are, attempting, to, go, back, on, the, crimea, decision, roosevelt, conceded, that, in, the, words, of, admiral, william, d, leahy, the, language, of, yalta, was, so, vague, that, the, soviets, could, stretch, it, all, the, way, from, yalta, to, washington, without, ever, technically, breaking, it, the, final, agreement, stipulated, that, the, provisional, government, which, is, now, functioning, in, poland, should, therefore, be, reorganized, on, a, broader, democratic, basis, with, the, inclusion, of, democratic, leaders, from, poland, and, from, poles, abroad, the, language, of, yalta, conceded, predominance, of, the, pro, soviet, lublin, government, in, a, provisional, government, but, a, reorganized, one, because, of, stalin, s, promises, churchill, believed, that, he, would, keep, his, word, regarding, poland, and, he, remarked, poor, neville, chamberlain, believed, he, could, trust, hitler, he, was, wrong, but, i, don, t, think, i, am, wrong, about, stalin, churchill, defended, his, actions, at, yalta, in, a, three, day, parliamentary, debate, starting, on, february, 27, which, ended, in, a, vote, of, confidence, during, the, debate, many, mps, criticised, churchill, and, expressed, deep, reservations, about, yalta, and, support, for, poland, with, 25, drafting, an, amendment, protesting, the, agreement, after, the, second, world, war, ended, a, communist, government, was, installed, in, poland, many, poles, felt, betrayed, by, their, wartime, allies, many, polish, soldiers, refused, to, return, to, poland, because, of, the, soviet, repressions, of, polish, citizens, 1939, 1946, the, trial, of, the, sixteen, and, other, executions, of, pro, western, poles, particularly, the, former, members, of, the, ak, armia, krajowa, the, result, was, the, polish, resettlement, act, 1947, britain, s, first, mass, immigration, law, on, march, 1, 1945, roosevelt, assured, congress, i, come, from, the, crimea, with, a, firm, belief, that, we, have, made, a, start, on, the, road, to, a, world, of, peace, however, the, western, powers, soon, realized, that, stalin, would, not, honour, his, promise, of, free, elections, for, poland, after, receiving, considerable, criticism, in, london, following, yalta, regarding, the, atrocities, committed, in, poland, by, soviet, troops, churchill, wrote, roosevelt, a, desperate, letter, referencing, the, wholesale, deportations, and, liquidations, of, opposition, poles, by, the, soviets, on, march, 11, roosevelt, responded, to, churchill, i, most, certainly, agree, that, we, must, stand, firm, on, a, correct, interpretation, of, the, crimean, decision, you, are, quite, correct, in, assuming, that, neither, the, government, nor, the, people, of, this, country, will, support, participation, in, a, fraud, or, a, mere, whitewash, of, the, lublin, government, and, the, solution, must, be, as, we, envisaged, it, in, yalta, by, march, 21, roosevelt, s, ambassador, to, the, soviet, union, averell, harriman, cabled, roosevelt, that, we, must, come, clearly, to, realize, that, the, soviet, program, is, the, establishment, of, totalitarianism, ending, personal, liberty, and, democracy, as, we, know, it, two, days, later, roosevelt, began, to, admit, that, his, view, of, stalin, had, been, excessively, optimistic, and, that, averell, is, right, four, days, later, on, march, 27, the, soviet, people, s, commissariat, for, internal, affairs, nkvd, arrested, 16, polish, opposition, political, leaders, who, had, been, invited, to, participate, in, provisional, government, negotiations, the, arrests, were, part, of, a, trick, employed, by, the, nkvd, which, flew, the, leaders, to, moscow, for, a, later, show, trial, followed, by, sentencing, to, a, gulag, churchill, thereafter, argued, to, roosevelt, that, it, was, as, plain, as, a, pike, staff, that, moscow, s, tactics, were, to, drag, out, the, period, for, holding, free, elections, while, the, lublin, committee, consolidate, their, power, the, polish, elections, held, on, january, 16, 1947, resulted, in, poland, s, official, transformation, to, a, communist, state, by, 1949, following, yalta, soviet, foreign, minister, vyacheslav, molotov, expressed, worry, that, the, yalta, agreement, s, wording, might, impede, stalin, s, plans, stalin, responded, never, mind, we, ll, do, it, our, own, way, later, the, soviet, union, had, already, annexed, several, occupied, countries, as, or, into, soviet, socialist, republics, and, other, countries, in, central, and, eastern, europe, were, occupied, and, converted, into, soviet, controlled, satellite, states, such, as, the, people, s, republic, of, poland, the, people, s, republic, of, hungary, the, czechoslovak, socialist, republic, the, people, s, republic, of, romania, the, people, s, republic, of, bulgaria, the, people, s, republic, of, albania, and, later, east, germany, from, the, soviet, zone, of, german, occupation, eventually, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, made, concessions, in, recognizing, the, communist, dominated, regions, by, sacrificing, the, substance, of, the, yalta, declaration, although, it, remained, in, form, at, some, point, in, the, spring, of, 1945, churchill, had, commissioned, a, contingency, military, enforcement, operation, plan, for, war, on, the, soviet, union, to, obtain, square, deal, for, poland, operation, unthinkable, which, resulted, in, a, may, 22, report, that, stated, unfavorable, success, odds, the, report, s, arguments, included, geostrategic, issues, a, possible, soviet, japanese, alliance, resulting, in, moving, of, japanese, troops, from, the, asian, continent, to, home, islands, threat, to, iran, and, iraq, and, uncertainties, concerning, land, battles, in, europe, the, potsdam, conference, was, held, from, july, to, august, 1945, which, included, the, participation, of, clement, attlee, who, had, replaced, churchill, as, prime, minister, and, president, harry, s, truman, representing, the, united, states, after, roosevelt, s, death, at, potsdam, the, soviets, denied, claims, that, they, were, interfering, in, the, affairs, of, romania, bulgaria, and, hungary, the, conference, resulted, in, the, potsdam, declaration, regarding, the, surrender, of, japan, and, the, potsdam, agreement, regarding, the, soviet, annexation, of, former, polish, territory, east, of, the, curzon, line, provisions, to, be, addressed, in, an, eventual, final, treaty, ending, world, war, ii, and, the, annexation, of, parts, of, germany, east, of, the, oder, neisse, line, into, poland, and, of, northern, east, prussia, into, the, soviet, union, roosevelt, s, generous, terms, to, stalin, followed, quite, quickly, by, the, start, of, the, cold, war, under, roosevelt, s, vice, president, and, successor, harry, truman, meant, that, yalta, was, often, seen, in, a, bad, light, in, american, public, opinion, particularly, among, most, shades, of, republicans, and, more, conservative, democrats, in, the, south, and, west, as, well, as, by, many, ethnic, americans, with, links, to, eastern, europe, when, eisenhower, was, elected, as, president, on, the, republican, ticket, there, were, hopes, that, yalta, would, be, repudiated, by, the, new, administration, and, the, newly, republican, senate, efforts, were, made, by, both, the, new, senate, majority, leader, robert, a, taft, and, republican, members, of, the, foreign, relations, committee, although, this, fizzled, out, after, stalin, s, death, 44, 28, 04, n, 34, 08, 36, e, 44, 46778, n, 34, 14333, e, 44, 46778, 34, 14333
