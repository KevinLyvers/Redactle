military, dead, 1, 495, 000, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918, associated, articles, the, western, front, was, one, of, the, main, theatres, of, war, during, the, first, world, war, following, the, outbreak, of, war, in, august, 1914, the, german, army, opened, the, western, front, by, invading, luxembourg, and, belgium, then, gaining, military, control, of, important, industrial, regions, in, france, the, german, advance, was, halted, with, the, battle, of, the, marne, following, the, race, to, the, sea, both, sides, dug, in, along, a, meandering, line, of, fortified, trenches, stretching, from, the, north, sea, to, the, swiss, frontier, with, france, the, position, of, which, changed, little, except, during, early, 1917, and, again, in, 1918, between, 1915, and, 1917, there, were, several, offensives, along, this, front, the, attacks, employed, massive, artillery, bombardments, and, massed, infantry, advances, entrenchments, machine, gun, emplacements, barbed, wire, and, artillery, repeatedly, inflicted, severe, casualties, during, attacks, and, counter, attacks, and, no, significant, advances, were, made, among, the, most, costly, of, these, offensives, were, the, battle, of, verdun, in, 1916, with, a, combined, 700, 000, casualties, the, battle, of, the, somme, also, in, 1916, with, more, than, a, million, casualties, and, the, battle, of, passchendaele, in, 1917, with, 487, 000, casualties, to, break, the, deadlock, of, the, trench, warfare, on, the, western, front, both, sides, tried, new, military, technology, including, poison, gas, aircraft, and, tanks, the, adoption, of, better, tactics, and, the, cumulative, weakening, of, the, armies, in, the, west, led, to, the, return, of, mobility, in, 1918, the, german, spring, offensive, of, 1918, was, made, possible, by, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, that, ended, the, war, of, the, central, powers, against, russia, and, romania, on, the, eastern, front, using, short, intense, hurricane, bombardments, and, infiltration, tactics, the, german, armies, moved, nearly, 100, kilometres, 60, miles, to, the, west, the, deepest, advance, by, either, side, since, 1914, but, the, result, was, indecisive, the, unstoppable, advance, of, the, allied, armies, during, the, hundred, days, offensive, of, 1918, caused, a, sudden, collapse, of, the, german, armies, and, persuaded, the, german, commanders, that, defeat, was, inevitable, the, german, government, surrendered, in, the, armistice, of, 11, november, 1918, and, the, terms, of, peace, were, settled, by, the, treaty, of, versailles, in, 1919, the, western, front, was, the, place, where, the, most, powerful, military, forces, in, europe, the, german, and, french, armies, met, and, where, the, first, world, war, was, decided, at, the, outbreak, of, the, war, the, german, army, with, seven, field, armies, in, the, west, and, one, in, the, east, executed, a, modified, version, of, the, schlieffen, plan, bypassing, french, defenses, along, the, common, border, by, moving, quickly, through, neutral, belgium, and, then, turning, southwards, to, attack, france, and, attempt, to, encircle, the, french, army, and, trap, it, on, the, german, border, belgian, neutrality, had, been, guaranteed, by, britain, under, the, treaty, of, london, 1839, this, caused, britain, to, join, the, war, at, the, expiration, of, its, ultimatum, at, midnight, on, 4, august, armies, under, german, generals, alexander, von, kluck, and, karl, von, b, low, attacked, belgium, on, 4, august, 1914, luxembourg, had, been, occupied, without, opposition, on, 2, august, the, first, battle, in, belgium, was, the, battle, of, li, ge, a, siege, that, lasted, from, 5, 16, august, li, ge, was, well, fortified, and, surprised, the, german, army, under, b, low, with, its, level, of, resistance, german, heavy, artillery, was, able, to, demolish, the, main, forts, within, a, few, days, following, the, fall, of, li, ge, most, of, the, belgian, field, army, retreated, to, antwerp, leaving, the, garrison, of, namur, isolated, with, the, belgian, capital, brussels, falling, to, the, germans, on, 20, august, although, the, german, army, bypassed, antwerp, it, remained, a, threat, to, their, flank, another, siege, followed, at, namur, lasting, from, about, 20, 23, august, the, french, deployed, five, armies, on, the, frontier, the, french, plan, xvii, was, intended, to, bring, about, the, capture, of, alsace, lorraine, on, 7, august, the, vii, corps, attacked, alsace, to, capture, mulhouse, and, colmar, the, main, offensive, was, launched, on, 14, august, with, the, first, and, second, armies, attacking, toward, sarrebourg, morhange, in, lorraine, in, keeping, with, the, schlieffen, plan, the, germans, withdrew, slowly, while, inflicting, severe, losses, upon, the, french, the, french, third, and, fourth, armies, advanced, toward, the, saar, and, attempted, to, capture, saarburg, attacking, briey, and, neufchateau, but, were, repulsed, the, french, vii, corps, captured, mulhouse, after, a, brief, engagement, first, on, 7, august, and, then, again, on, 23, august, but, german, reserve, forces, engaged, them, in, the, battle, of, mulhouse, and, forced, the, french, to, retreat, twice, the, german, army, swept, through, belgium, executing, civilians, and, razing, villages, the, application, of, collective, responsibility, against, a, civilian, population, further, galvanised, the, allies, newspapers, condemned, the, german, invasion, violence, against, civilians, and, destruction, of, property, which, became, known, as, the, rape, of, belgium, after, marching, through, belgium, luxembourg, and, the, ardennes, the, germans, advanced, into, northern, france, in, late, august, where, they, met, the, french, army, under, joseph, joffre, and, the, divisions, of, the, british, expeditionary, force, under, field, marshal, sir, john, french, a, series, of, engagements, known, as, the, battle, of, the, frontiers, ensued, which, included, the, battle, of, charleroi, and, the, battle, of, mons, in, the, former, battle, the, french, fifth, army, was, almost, destroyed, by, the, german, 2nd, and, 3rd, armies, and, the, latter, delayed, the, german, advance, by, a, day, a, general, allied, retreat, followed, resulting, in, more, clashes, at, the, battle, of, le, cateau, the, siege, of, maubeuge, and, the, battle, of, st, quentin, also, called, the, first, battle, of, guise, the, german, army, came, within, 70, km, 43, mi, of, paris, but, at, the, first, battle, of, the, marne, 6, 12, september, french, and, british, troops, were, able, to, force, a, german, retreat, by, exploiting, a, gap, which, appeared, between, the, 1st, and, 2nd, armies, ending, the, german, advance, into, france, the, german, army, retreated, north, of, the, aisne, and, dug, in, there, establishing, the, beginnings, of, a, static, western, front, that, was, to, last, for, the, next, three, years, following, this, german, retirement, the, opposing, forces, made, reciprocal, outflanking, manoeuvres, known, as, the, race, to, the, sea, and, quickly, extended, their, trench, systems, from, the, swiss, frontier, to, the, north, sea, the, territory, occupied, by, germany, held, 64, percent, of, french, pig, iron, production, 24, percent, of, its, steel, manufacturing, and, 40, percent, of, the, coal, industry, dealing, a, serious, blow, to, french, industry, on, the, entente, side, those, countries, opposing, the, german, alliance, the, final, lines, were, occupied, with, the, armies, of, each, nation, defending, a, part, of, the, front, from, the, coast, in, the, north, the, primary, forces, were, from, belgium, the, british, empire, and, then, france, following, the, battle, of, the, yser, in, october, the, belgian, army, controlled, a, 35, km, 22, mi, length, of, west, flanders, along, the, coast, known, as, the, yser, front, along, the, yser, and, the, ieperlee, from, nieuwpoort, to, boezinge, meanwhile, the, british, expeditionary, force, bef, occupied, a, position, on, the, flank, having, occupied, a, more, central, position, from, 19, october, until, 22, november, the, german, forces, made, their, final, breakthrough, attempt, of, 1914, during, the, first, battle, of, ypres, which, ended, in, a, mutually, costly, stalemate, after, the, battle, erich, von, falkenhayn, judged, that, it, was, no, longer, possible, for, germany, to, win, the, war, by, purely, military, means, and, on, 18, november, 1914, he, called, for, a, diplomatic, solution, the, chancellor, theobald, von, bethmann, hollweg, generalfeldmarschall, paul, von, hindenburg, commanding, ober, ost, eastern, front, high, command, and, his, deputy, erich, ludendorff, continued, to, believe, that, victory, was, achievable, through, decisive, battles, during, the, lodz, offensive, in, poland, 11, 25, november, falkenhayn, hoped, that, the, russians, would, be, made, amenable, to, peace, overtures, in, his, discussions, with, bethmann, hollweg, falkenhayn, viewed, germany, and, russia, as, having, no, insoluble, conflict, and, that, the, real, enemies, of, germany, were, france, and, britain, a, peace, with, only, a, few, annexations, of, territory, also, seemed, possible, with, france, and, that, with, russia, and, france, out, of, the, war, by, negotiated, settlements, germany, could, concentrate, on, britain, and, fight, a, long, war, with, the, resources, of, europe, at, its, disposal, hindenburg, and, ludendorff, continued, to, believe, that, russia, could, be, defeated, by, a, series, of, battles, which, cumulatively, would, have, a, decisive, effect, after, which, germany, could, finish, off, france, and, britain, trench, warfare, in, 1914, while, not, new, quickly, improved, and, provided, a, very, high, degree, of, defense, according, to, two, prominent, historians, between, the, coast, and, the, vosges, was, a, westward, bulge, in, the, trench, line, named, the, noyon, salient, after, the, french, town, at, the, maximum, point, of, the, german, advance, near, compi, gne, joffre, s, plan, for, 1915, was, to, attack, the, salient, on, both, flanks, to, cut, it, off, the, fourth, army, had, attacked, in, champagne, from, 20, december, 1914, 17, march, 1915, but, the, french, were, not, able, to, attack, in, artois, at, the, same, time, the, tenth, army, formed, the, northern, attack, force, and, was, to, attack, eastwards, into, the, douai, plain, on, a, 16, km, 9, 9, mi, front, between, loos, and, arras, on, 10, march, as, part, of, the, larger, offensive, in, the, artois, region, the, british, army, fought, the, battle, of, neuve, chapelle, to, capture, aubers, ridge, the, assault, was, made, by, four, divisions, on, a, 2, mi, 3, 2, km, front, preceded, by, a, hurricane, bombardment, lasting, only, 35, minutes, the, village, was, captured, within, four, hours, the, advance, then, slowed, because, of, supply, and, communication, difficulties, the, germans, brought, up, reserves, and, counterattacked, forestalling, the, attempt, to, capture, the, ridge, since, the, british, had, used, about, a, third, of, their, artillery, ammunition, general, sir, john, french, blamed, the, failure, on, the, shell, crisis, of, 1915, despite, the, early, success, all, sides, had, signed, the, hague, conventions, of, 1899, and, 1907, which, prohibited, the, use, of, chemical, weapons, in, warfare, in, 1914, there, had, been, small, scale, attempts, by, both, the, french, and, germans, to, use, various, tear, gases, which, were, not, strictly, prohibited, by, the, early, treaties, but, which, were, also, ineffective, the, first, use, of, more, lethal, chemical, weapons, on, the, western, front, was, against, the, french, near, the, belgian, town, of, ypres, the, germans, had, already, deployed, gas, against, the, russians, in, the, east, at, the, battle, of, humin, bolim, w, despite, the, german, plans, to, maintain, the, stalemate, with, the, french, and, british, albrecht, duke, of, w, rttemberg, commander, of, the, 4th, army, planned, an, offensive, at, ypres, site, of, the, first, battle, of, ypres, in, november, 1914, the, second, battle, of, ypres, april, 1915, was, intended, to, divert, attention, from, offensives, in, the, eastern, front, and, disrupt, franco, british, planning, after, a, two, day, bombardment, the, germans, released, a, lethal, cloud, of, 168, long, tons, 171, t, of, chlorine, onto, the, battlefield, though, primarily, a, powerful, irritant, it, can, asphyxiate, in, high, concentrations, or, prolonged, exposure, being, heavier, than, air, the, gas, crept, across, no, man, s, land, and, drifted, into, the, french, trenches, the, green, yellow, cloud, started, killing, some, defenders, and, those, in, the, rear, fled, in, panic, creating, an, undefended, 3, 7, mile, 6, km, gap, in, the, allied, line, the, germans, were, unprepared, for, the, level, of, their, success, and, lacked, sufficient, reserves, to, exploit, the, opening, canadian, troops, on, the, right, drew, back, their, left, flank, and, halted, the, german, advance, the, gas, attack, was, repeated, two, days, later, and, caused, a, 3, 1, mi, 5, km, withdrawal, of, the, franco, british, line, but, the, opportunity, had, been, lost, the, success, of, this, attack, would, not, be, repeated, as, the, allies, countered, by, introducing, gas, masks, and, other, countermeasures, an, example, of, the, success, of, these, measures, came, a, year, later, on, 27, april, in, the, gas, attacks, at, hulluch, 40, km, 25, mi, to, the, south, of, ypres, where, the, 16th, irish, division, withstood, several, german, gas, attacks, the, british, retaliated, developing, their, own, chlorine, gas, and, using, it, at, the, battle, of, loos, in, september, 1915, fickle, winds, and, inexperience, led, to, more, british, casualties, from, the, gas, than, german, french, british, and, german, forces, all, escalated, the, use, of, gas, attacks, through, the, rest, of, the, war, developing, the, more, deadly, phosgene, gas, in, 1915, then, the, infamous, mustard, gas, in, 1917, which, could, linger, for, days, and, could, kill, slowly, and, painfully, countermeasures, also, improved, and, the, stalemate, continued, specialised, aeroplanes, for, aerial, combat, were, introduced, in, 1915, aircraft, were, already, in, use, for, scouting, and, on, 1, april, the, french, pilot, roland, garros, became, the, first, to, shoot, down, an, enemy, aircraft, by, using, a, machine, gun, that, shot, forward, through, the, propeller, blades, this, was, achieved, by, crudely, reinforcing, the, blades, to, deflect, bullets, several, weeks, later, garros, force, landed, behind, german, lines, his, aeroplane, was, captured, and, sent, to, dutch, engineer, anthony, fokker, who, soon, produced, a, significant, improvement, the, interrupter, gear, in, which, the, machine, gun, is, synchronised, with, the, propeller, so, it, fires, in, the, intervals, when, the, blades, of, the, propeller, are, out, of, the, line, of, fire, this, advance, was, quickly, ushered, into, service, in, the, fokker, e, i, eindecker, or, monoplane, mark, 1, the, first, single, seat, fighter, aircraft, to, combine, a, reasonable, maximum, speed, with, an, effective, armament, max, immelmann, scored, the, first, confirmed, kill, in, an, eindecker, on, 1, august, both, sides, developed, improved, weapons, engines, airframes, and, materials, until, the, end, of, the, war, it, also, inaugurated, the, cult, of, the, ace, the, most, famous, being, manfred, von, richthofen, the, red, baron, contrary, to, the, myth, anti, aircraft, fire, claimed, more, kills, than, fighters, the, final, entente, offensive, of, the, spring, was, the, second, battle, of, artois, an, offensive, to, capture, vimy, ridge, and, advance, into, the, douai, plain, the, french, tenth, army, attacked, on, 9, may, after, a, six, day, bombardment, and, advanced, 5, kilometres, 3, mi, to, capture, vimy, ridge, german, reinforcements, counter, attacked, and, pushed, the, french, back, towards, their, starting, points, because, french, reserves, had, been, held, back, and, the, success, of, the, attack, had, come, as, a, surprise, by, 15, may, the, advance, had, been, stopped, although, the, fighting, continued, until, 18, june, in, may, the, german, army, captured, a, french, document, at, la, ville, aux, bois, describing, a, new, system, of, defence, rather, than, relying, on, a, heavily, fortified, front, line, the, defence, was, to, be, arranged, in, a, series, of, echelons, the, front, line, would, be, a, thinly, manned, series, of, outposts, reinforced, by, a, series, of, strongpoints, and, a, sheltered, reserve, if, a, slope, was, available, troops, were, deployed, along, the, rear, side, for, protection, the, defence, became, fully, integrated, with, command, of, artillery, at, the, divisional, level, members, of, the, german, high, command, viewed, this, new, scheme, with, some, favour, and, it, later, became, the, basis, of, an, elastic, defence, in, depth, doctrine, against, entente, attacks, during, the, autumn, of, 1915, the, fokker, scourge, began, to, have, an, effect, on, the, battlefront, as, allied, reconnaissance, aircraft, were, nearly, driven, from, the, skies, these, reconnaissance, aircraft, were, used, to, direct, gunnery, and, photograph, enemy, fortifications, but, now, the, allies, were, nearly, blinded, by, german, fighters, however, the, impact, of, german, air, superiority, was, diminished, by, their, primarily, defensive, doctrine, in, which, they, tended, to, remain, over, their, own, lines, rather, than, fighting, over, allied, held, territory, in, september, 1915, the, entente, allies, launched, another, offensive, with, the, french, third, battle, of, artois, second, battle, of, champagne, and, the, british, at, loos, the, french, had, spent, the, summer, preparing, for, this, action, with, the, british, assuming, control, of, more, of, the, front, to, release, french, troops, for, the, attack, the, bombardment, which, had, been, carefully, targeted, by, means, of, aerial, photography, began, on, 22, september, the, main, french, assault, was, launched, on, 25, september, and, at, first, made, good, progress, in, spite, of, surviving, wire, entanglements, and, machine, gun, posts, rather, than, retreating, the, germans, adopted, a, new, defence, in, depth, scheme, that, consisted, of, a, series, of, defensive, zones, and, positions, with, a, depth, of, up, to, 8, 0, km, 5, mi, on, 25, september, the, british, began, the, battle, of, loos, part, of, the, third, battle, of, artois, which, was, meant, to, supplement, the, larger, champagne, attack, the, attack, was, preceded, by, a, four, day, artillery, bombardment, of, 250, 000, shells, and, a, release, of, 5, 100, cylinders, of, chlorine, gas, the, attack, involved, two, corps, in, the, main, assault, and, two, corps, performing, diversionary, attacks, at, ypres, the, british, suffered, heavy, losses, especially, due, to, machine, gun, fire, during, the, attack, and, made, only, limited, gains, before, they, ran, out, of, shells, a, renewal, of, the, attack, on, 13, october, fared, little, better, in, december, french, was, replaced, by, general, douglas, haig, as, commander, of, the, british, forces, falkenhayn, believed, that, a, breakthrough, might, no, longer, be, possible, and, instead, focused, on, forcing, a, french, defeat, by, inflicting, massive, casualties, his, new, goal, was, to, bleed, france, white, as, such, he, adopted, two, new, strategies, the, first, was, the, use, of, unrestricted, submarine, warfare, to, cut, off, allied, supplies, arriving, from, overseas, the, second, would, be, attacks, against, the, french, army, intended, to, inflict, maximum, casualties, falkenhayn, planned, to, attack, a, position, from, which, the, french, could, not, retreat, for, reasons, of, strategy, and, national, pride, and, thus, trap, the, french, the, town, of, verdun, was, chosen, for, this, because, it, was, an, important, stronghold, surrounded, by, a, ring, of, forts, that, lay, near, the, german, lines, and, because, it, guarded, the, direct, route, to, paris, falkenhayn, limited, the, size, of, the, front, to, 5, 6, kilometres, 3, 4, mi, to, concentrate, artillery, firepower, and, to, prevent, a, breakthrough, from, a, counter, offensive, he, also, kept, tight, control, of, the, main, reserve, feeding, in, just, enough, troops, to, keep, the, battle, going, in, preparation, for, their, attack, the, germans, had, amassed, a, concentration, of, aircraft, near, the, fortress, in, the, opening, phase, they, swept, the, air, space, of, french, aircraft, which, allowed, german, artillery, observation, aircraft, and, bombers, to, operate, without, interference, in, may, the, french, countered, by, deploying, escadrilles, de, chasse, with, superior, nieuport, fighters, and, the, air, over, verdun, turned, into, a, battlefield, as, both, sides, fought, for, air, superiority, the, battle, of, verdun, began, on, 21, february, 1916, after, a, nine, day, delay, due, to, snow, and, blizzards, after, a, massive, eight, hour, artillery, bombardment, the, germans, did, not, expect, much, resistance, as, they, slowly, advanced, on, verdun, and, its, forts, sporadic, french, resistance, was, encountered, the, germans, took, fort, douaumont, and, then, reinforcements, halted, the, german, advance, by, 28, february, the, germans, turned, their, focus, to, le, mort, homme, on, the, west, bank, of, the, meuse, which, blocked, the, route, to, french, artillery, emplacements, from, which, the, french, fired, across, the, river, after, some, of, the, most, intense, fighting, of, the, campaign, the, hill, was, taken, by, the, germans, in, late, may, after, a, change, in, french, command, at, verdun, from, the, defensive, minded, philippe, p, tain, to, the, offensive, minded, robert, nivelle, the, french, attempted, to, re, capture, fort, douaumont, on, 22, may, but, were, easily, repulsed, the, germans, captured, fort, vaux, on, 7, june, and, with, the, aid, of, diphosgene, gas, came, within, 1, kilometre, 1, 100, yd, of, the, last, ridge, before, verdun, before, being, contained, on, 23, june, over, the, summer, the, french, slowly, advanced, with, the, development, of, the, rolling, barrage, the, french, recaptured, fort, vaux, in, november, and, by, december, 1916, they, had, pushed, the, germans, back, 2, 1, kilometres, 1, 3, mi, from, fort, douaumont, in, the, process, rotating, 42, divisions, through, the, battle, the, battle, of, verdun, also, known, as, the, mincing, machine, of, verdun, or, meuse, mill, became, a, symbol, of, french, determination, and, self, sacrifice, in, the, spring, allied, commanders, had, been, concerned, about, the, ability, of, the, french, army, to, withstand, the, enormous, losses, at, verdun, the, original, plans, for, an, attack, around, the, river, somme, were, modified, to, let, the, british, make, the, main, effort, this, would, serve, to, relieve, pressure, on, the, french, as, well, as, the, russians, who, had, also, suffered, great, losses, on, 1, july, after, a, week, of, heavy, rain, british, divisions, in, picardy, began, the, battle, of, the, somme, with, the, battle, of, albert, supported, by, five, french, divisions, on, their, right, flank, the, attack, had, been, preceded, by, seven, days, of, heavy, artillery, bombardment, the, experienced, french, forces, were, successful, in, advancing, but, the, british, artillery, cover, had, neither, blasted, away, barbed, wire, nor, destroyed, german, trenches, as, effectively, as, was, planned, they, suffered, the, greatest, number, of, casualties, killed, wounded, and, missing, in, a, single, day, in, the, history, of, the, british, army, about, 57, 000, the, verdun, lesson, learnt, the, allies, tactical, aim, became, the, achievement, of, air, superiority, and, until, september, german, aircraft, were, swept, from, the, skies, over, the, somme, the, success, of, the, allied, air, offensive, caused, a, reorganisation, of, the, german, air, arm, and, both, sides, began, using, large, formations, of, aircraft, rather, than, relying, on, individual, combat, after, regrouping, the, battle, continued, throughout, july, and, august, with, some, success, for, the, british, despite, the, reinforcement, of, the, german, lines, by, august, general, haig, had, concluded, that, a, breakthrough, was, unlikely, and, instead, switched, tactics, to, a, series, of, small, unit, actions, the, effect, was, to, straighten, out, the, front, line, which, was, thought, necessary, in, preparation, for, a, massive, artillery, bombardment, with, a, major, push, the, final, phase, of, the, battle, of, the, somme, saw, the, first, use, of, the, tank, on, the, battlefield, the, allies, prepared, an, attack, that, would, involve, 13, british, and, imperial, divisions, and, four, french, corps, the, attack, made, early, progress, advancing, 3, 200, 4, 100, metres, 3, 500, 4, 500, yd, in, places, but, the, tanks, had, little, effect, due, to, their, lack, of, numbers, and, mechanical, unreliability, the, final, phase, of, the, battle, took, place, in, october, and, early, november, again, producing, limited, gains, with, heavy, loss, of, life, all, told, the, somme, battle, had, made, penetrations, of, only, 8, kilometres, 5, mi, and, failed, to, reach, the, original, objectives, the, british, had, suffered, about, 420, 000, casualties, and, the, french, around, 200, 000, it, is, estimated, that, the, germans, lost, 465, 000, although, this, figure, is, controversial, the, somme, led, directly, to, major, new, developments, in, infantry, organisation, and, tactics, despite, the, terrible, losses, of, 1, july, some, divisions, had, managed, to, achieve, their, objectives, with, minimal, casualties, in, examining, the, reasons, behind, losses, and, achievements, once, the, british, war, economy, produced, sufficient, equipment, and, weapons, the, army, made, the, platoon, the, basic, tactical, unit, similar, to, the, french, and, german, armies, at, the, time, of, the, somme, british, senior, commanders, insisted, that, the, company, 120, men, was, the, smallest, unit, of, manoeuvre, less, than, a, year, later, the, section, of, ten, men, would, be, so, in, august, 1916, the, german, leadership, along, the, western, front, had, changed, as, falkenhayn, resigned, and, was, replaced, by, hindenburg, and, ludendorff, the, new, leaders, soon, recognised, that, the, battles, of, verdun, and, the, somme, had, depleted, the, offensive, capabilities, of, the, german, army, they, decided, that, the, german, army, in, the, west, would, go, over, to, the, strategic, defensive, for, most, of, 1917, while, the, central, powers, would, attack, elsewhere, during, the, somme, battle, and, through, the, winter, months, the, germans, created, a, fortification, behind, the, noyon, salient, that, would, be, called, the, hindenburg, line, using, the, defensive, principles, elaborated, since, the, defensive, battles, of, 1915, including, the, use, of, eingreif, divisions, this, was, intended, to, shorten, the, german, front, freeing, 10, divisions, for, other, duties, this, line, of, fortifications, ran, from, arras, south, to, st, quentin, and, shortened, the, front, by, about, 50, kilometres, 30, mi, british, long, range, reconnaissance, aircraft, first, spotted, the, construction, of, the, hindenburg, line, in, november, 1916, the, hindenburg, line, was, built, between, 2, mi, 3, 2, km, and, 30, mi, 48, km, behind, the, german, front, line, on, 25, february, the, german, armies, west, of, the, line, began, operation, alberich, a, withdrawal, to, the, line, and, completed, the, retirement, on, 5, april, leaving, a, supply, desert, of, scorched, earth, to, be, occupied, by, the, allies, this, withdrawal, negated, the, french, strategy, of, attacking, both, flanks, of, the, noyon, salient, as, it, no, longer, existed, the, british, continued, offensive, operations, as, the, war, office, claimed, with, some, justification, that, this, withdrawal, resulted, from, the, casualties, the, germans, received, during, the, battles, of, the, somme, and, verdun, despite, the, allies, suffering, greater, losses, on, 6, april, the, united, states, declared, war, on, germany, in, early, 1915, following, the, sinking, of, the, lusitania, germany, had, stopped, unrestricted, submarine, warfare, in, the, atlantic, because, of, concerns, of, drawing, the, united, states, into, the, conflict, with, the, growing, discontent, of, the, german, public, due, to, the, food, shortages, the, government, resumed, unrestricted, submarine, warfare, in, february, 1917, they, calculated, that, a, successful, submarine, and, warship, siege, of, britain, would, force, that, country, out, of, the, war, within, six, months, while, american, forces, would, take, a, year, to, become, a, serious, factor, on, the, western, front, the, submarine, and, surface, ships, had, a, long, period, of, success, before, britain, resorted, to, the, convoy, system, bringing, a, large, reduction, in, shipping, losses, by, 1917, the, size, of, the, british, army, on, the, western, front, had, grown, to, two, thirds, of, the, size, of, the, french, force, in, april, 1917, the, bef, began, the, battle, of, arras, the, canadian, corps, and, the, 5th, division, of, the, first, army, fought, the, battle, of, vimy, ridge, completing, the, capture, of, the, ridge, and, the, third, army, to, the, south, achieved, the, deepest, advance, since, trench, warfare, began, later, attacks, were, confronted, by, german, reinforcements, defending, the, area, using, the, lessons, learned, on, the, somme, in, 1916, british, attacks, were, contained, and, according, to, gary, sheffield, a, greater, rate, of, daily, loss, was, inflicted, on, the, british, than, in, any, other, major, battle, during, the, winter, of, 1916, 1917, german, air, tactics, had, been, improved, a, fighter, training, school, was, opened, at, valenciennes, and, better, aircraft, with, twin, guns, were, introduced, the, result, was, higher, losses, of, allied, aircraft, particularly, for, the, british, portuguese, belgians, and, australians, who, were, struggling, with, outmoded, aircraft, poor, training, and, tactics, the, allied, air, successes, over, the, somme, were, not, repeated, during, their, attack, at, arras, the, british, lost, 316, air, crews, and, the, canadians, lost, 114, compared, to, 44, lost, by, the, germans, this, became, known, to, the, royal, flying, corps, as, bloody, april, the, same, month, the, french, commander, in, chief, general, robert, nivelle, ordered, a, new, offensive, against, the, german, trenches, promising, that, it, would, end, the, war, within, 48, hours, the, 16, april, attack, dubbed, the, nivelle, offensive, also, known, as, the, second, battle, of, the, aisne, would, be, 1, 2, million, men, strong, preceded, by, a, week, long, artillery, bombardment, and, accompanied, by, tanks, the, offensive, proceeded, poorly, as, the, french, troops, with, the, help, of, two, russian, brigades, had, to, negotiate, rough, upward, sloping, terrain, in, extremely, bad, weather, planning, had, been, dislocated, by, the, voluntary, german, withdrawal, to, the, hindenburg, line, secrecy, had, been, compromised, and, german, aircraft, gained, air, superiority, making, reconnaissance, difficult, and, in, places, the, creeping, barrage, moved, too, fast, for, the, french, troops, within, a, week, the, french, suffered, 120, 000, casualties, despite, the, casualties, and, his, promise, to, halt, the, offensive, if, it, did, not, produce, a, breakthrough, nivelle, ordered, the, attack, to, continue, into, may, on, 3, may, the, weary, french, 2nd, colonial, division, veterans, of, the, battle, of, verdun, refused, orders, arriving, drunk, and, without, their, weapons, lacking, the, means, to, punish, an, entire, division, its, officers, did, not, immediately, implement, harsh, measures, against, the, mutineers, mutinies, occurred, in, 54, french, divisions, and, 20, 000, men, deserted, other, allied, forces, attacked, but, suffered, massive, casualties, appeals, to, patriotism, and, duty, followed, as, did, mass, arrests, and, trials, the, french, soldiers, returned, to, defend, their, trenches, but, refused, to, participate, in, further, offensive, action, on, 15, may, nivelle, was, removed, from, command, replaced, by, p, tain, who, immediately, stopped, the, offensive, the, french, would, go, on, the, defensive, for, the, following, months, to, avoid, high, casualties, and, to, restore, confidence, in, the, french, high, command, while, the, british, assumed, greater, responsibility, on, 25, june, the, first, us, troops, began, to, arrive, in, france, forming, the, american, expeditionary, force, however, the, american, units, did, not, enter, the, trenches, in, divisional, strength, until, october, the, incoming, troops, required, training, and, equipment, before, they, could, join, in, the, effort, and, for, several, months, american, units, were, relegated, to, support, efforts, despite, this, however, their, presence, provided, a, much, needed, boost, to, allied, morale, with, the, promise, of, further, reinforcements, that, could, tip, the, manpower, balance, towards, the, allies, in, june, the, british, launched, an, offensive, in, flanders, in, part, to, take, the, pressure, off, the, french, armies, on, the, aisne, after, the, french, part, of, the, nivelle, offensive, failed, to, achieve, the, strategic, victory, that, had, been, planned, and, french, troops, began, to, mutiny, the, offensive, began, on, 7, june, with, a, british, attack, on, messines, ridge, south, of, ypres, to, retake, the, ground, lost, in, the, first, and, second, battles, in, 1914, since, 1915, specialist, royal, engineer, tunnelling, companies, had, been, digging, tunnels, under, the, ridge, and, about, 500, t, 490, long, tons, of, explosives, had, been, planted, in, 21, mines, under, the, german, defences, following, several, weeks, of, bombardment, the, explosives, in, 19, of, these, mines, were, detonated, killing, up, to, 7, 000, german, troops, the, infantry, advance, that, followed, relied, on, three, creeping, barrages, which, the, british, infantry, followed, to, capture, the, plateau, and, the, east, side, of, the, ridge, in, one, day, german, counter, attacks, were, defeated, and, the, southern, flank, of, the, gheluvelt, plateau, was, protected, from, german, observation, on, 11, july, 1917, during, unternehmen, strandfest, operation, beachparty, at, nieuport, on, the, coast, the, germans, introduced, a, new, weapon, into, the, war, when, they, fired, a, powerful, blistering, agent, sulfur, mustard, yellow, cross, gas, the, artillery, deployment, allowed, heavy, concentrations, of, the, gas, to, be, used, on, selected, targets, mustard, gas, was, persistent, and, could, contaminate, an, area, for, days, denying, it, to, the, british, an, additional, demoralising, factor, the, allies, increased, production, of, gas, for, chemical, warfare, but, took, until, late, 1918, to, copy, the, germans, and, begin, using, mustard, gas, from, 31, july, to, 10, november, the, third, battle, of, ypres, included, the, first, battle, of, passchendaele, and, culminated, in, the, second, battle, of, passchendaele, the, battle, had, the, original, aim, of, capturing, the, ridges, east, of, ypres, then, advancing, to, roulers, and, thourout, to, close, the, main, rail, line, supplying, the, german, garrisons, on, the, western, front, north, of, ypres, if, successful, the, northern, armies, were, then, to, capture, the, german, submarine, bases, on, the, belgian, coast, it, was, later, restricted, to, advancing, the, british, army, onto, the, ridges, around, ypres, as, the, unusually, wet, weather, slowed, british, progress, the, canadian, corps, relieved, the, ii, anzac, corps, and, took, the, village, of, passchendaele, on, 6, november, despite, rain, mud, and, many, casualties, the, offensive, was, costly, in, manpower, for, both, sides, for, relatively, little, gain, of, ground, against, determined, german, resistance, but, the, ground, captured, was, of, great, tactical, importance, in, the, drier, periods, the, british, advance, was, inexorable, and, during, the, unusually, wet, august, and, in, the, autumn, rains, that, began, in, early, october, the, germans, achieved, only, costly, defensive, successes, which, led, the, german, commanders, in, early, october, to, begin, preparations, for, a, general, retreat, both, sides, lost, a, combined, total, of, over, a, half, million, men, during, this, offensive, the, battle, has, become, a, byword, among, some, british, revisionist, historians, for, bloody, and, futile, slaughter, whilst, the, germans, called, passchendaele, the, greatest, martyrdom, of, the, war, on, 20, november, the, british, launched, the, first, massed, tank, attack, and, the, first, attack, using, predicted, artillery, fire, aiming, artillery, without, firing, the, guns, to, obtain, target, data, at, the, battle, of, cambrai, the, allies, attacked, with, 324, tanks, with, one, third, held, in, reserve, and, twelve, divisions, advancing, behind, a, hurricane, bombardment, against, two, german, divisions, the, machines, carried, fascines, on, their, fronts, to, bridge, trenches, and, the, 13, foot, wide, 4, m, german, tank, traps, special, grapnel, tanks, towed, hooks, to, pull, away, the, german, barbed, wire, the, attack, was, a, great, success, for, the, british, who, penetrated, further, in, six, hours, than, at, the, third, ypres, in, four, months, at, a, cost, of, only, 4, 000, british, casualties, the, advance, produced, an, awkward, salient, and, a, surprise, german, counter, offensive, began, on, 30, november, which, drove, back, the, british, in, the, south, and, failed, in, the, north, despite, the, reversal, the, attack, was, seen, as, a, success, by, the, allies, proving, that, tanks, could, overcome, trench, defences, the, germans, realised, that, the, use, of, tanks, by, the, allies, posed, a, new, threat, to, any, defensive, strategy, they, might, mount, the, battle, had, also, seen, the, first, mass, use, of, german, stosstruppen, on, the, western, front, in, the, attack, who, used, infantry, infiltration, tactics, to, penetrate, british, defences, bypassing, resistance, and, quickly, advancing, into, the, british, rear, following, the, successful, allied, attack, and, penetration, of, the, german, defences, at, cambrai, ludendorff, and, hindenburg, determined, that, the, only, opportunity, for, german, victory, lay, in, a, decisive, attack, along, the, western, front, during, the, spring, before, american, manpower, became, overwhelming, on, 3, march, 1918, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, was, signed, and, russia, withdrew, from, the, war, this, would, now, have, a, dramatic, effect, on, the, conflict, as, 33, divisions, were, released, from, the, eastern, front, for, deployment, to, the, west, the, germans, occupied, almost, as, much, russian, territory, under, the, provisions, of, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, as, they, did, in, the, second, world, war, but, this, considerably, restricted, their, troop, redeployment, the, germans, achieved, an, advantage, of, 192, divisions, in, the, west, to, the, 178, allied, divisions, which, allowed, germany, to, pull, veteran, units, from, the, line, and, retrain, them, as, stosstruppen, 40, infantry, and, 3, cavalry, divisions, were, retained, for, german, occupation, duties, in, the, east, the, allies, lacked, unity, of, command, and, suffered, from, morale, and, manpower, problems, the, british, and, french, armies, were, severely, depleted, and, not, in, a, position, to, attack, in, the, first, half, of, the, year, while, the, majority, of, the, newly, arrived, american, troops, were, still, training, with, just, six, complete, divisions, in, the, line, ludendorff, decided, on, an, offensive, strategy, beginning, with, a, big, attack, against, the, british, on, the, somme, to, separate, them, from, the, french, and, drive, them, back, to, the, channel, ports, the, attack, would, combine, the, new, storm, troop, tactics, with, over, 700, aircraft, tanks, and, a, carefully, planned, artillery, barrage, that, would, include, gas, attacks, operation, michael, the, first, of, the, german, spring, offensives, very, nearly, succeeded, in, driving, the, allied, armies, apart, advancing, to, within, shelling, distance, of, paris, for, the, first, time, since, 1914, as, a, result, of, the, battle, the, allies, agreed, on, unity, of, command, general, ferdinand, foch, was, appointed, commander, of, all, allied, forces, in, france, the, unified, allies, were, better, able, to, respond, to, each, of, the, german, drives, and, the, offensive, turned, into, a, battle, of, attrition, in, may, the, american, divisions, also, began, to, play, an, increasing, role, winning, their, first, victory, in, the, battle, of, cantigny, by, summer, between, 250, 000, and, 300, 000, american, soldiers, were, arriving, every, month, a, total, of, 2, 1, million, american, troops, would, be, deployed, on, this, front, before, the, war, came, to, an, end, the, rapidly, increasing, american, presence, served, as, a, counter, for, the, large, numbers, of, redeployed, german, forces, in, july, foch, began, the, second, battle, of, the, marne, a, counter, offensive, against, the, marne, salient, which, was, eliminated, by, august, the, battle, of, amiens, began, two, days, later, with, franco, british, forces, spearheaded, by, australian, and, canadian, troops, along, with, 600, tanks, and, 800, aircraft, hindenburg, named, 8, august, as, the, black, day, of, the, german, army, the, italian, 2nd, corps, commanded, by, general, alberico, albricci, also, participated, in, the, operations, around, reims, german, manpower, had, been, severely, depleted, after, four, years, of, war, and, its, economy, and, society, were, under, great, internal, strain, the, allies, fielded, 216, divisions, against, 197, german, divisions, the, hundred, days, offensive, beginning, in, august, proved, the, final, straw, and, following, this, string, of, military, defeats, german, troops, began, to, surrender, in, large, numbers, as, the, allied, forces, advanced, prince, maximilian, of, baden, was, appointed, as, chancellor, of, germany, in, october, to, negotiate, an, armistice, ludendorff, was, forced, out, and, fled, to, sweden, the, german, retreat, continued, and, the, german, revolution, put, a, new, government, in, power, the, armistice, of, compi, gne, was, quickly, signed, stopping, hostilities, on, the, western, front, on, 11, november, 1918, later, known, as, armistice, day, the, german, imperial, monarchy, collapsed, when, general, groener, the, successor, to, ludendorff, backed, the, moderate, social, democratic, government, under, friedrich, ebert, to, forestall, a, revolution, like, those, in, russia, the, previous, year, the, war, along, the, western, front, led, the, german, government, and, its, allies, to, sue, for, peace, in, spite, of, german, success, elsewhere, as, a, result, the, terms, of, the, peace, were, dictated, by, france, britain, and, the, united, states, during, the, 1919, paris, peace, conference, the, result, was, the, treaty, of, versailles, signed, in, june, 1919, by, a, delegation, of, the, new, german, government, the, terms, of, the, treaty, constrained, germany, as, an, economic, and, military, power, the, versailles, treaty, returned, the, border, provinces, of, alsace, lorraine, to, france, thus, limiting, the, quantity, of, coal, available, to, german, industry, the, saar, which, formed, the, west, bank, of, the, rhine, would, be, demilitarized, and, controlled, by, britain, and, france, while, the, kiel, canal, opened, to, international, traffic, the, treaty, also, drastically, reshaped, eastern, europe, it, severely, limited, the, german, armed, forces, by, restricting, the, size, of, the, army, to, 100, 000, and, prohibiting, a, navy, or, air, force, the, navy, was, sailed, to, scapa, flow, under, the, terms, of, surrender, but, was, later, scuttled, as, a, reaction, to, the, treaty, the, war, in, the, trenches, of, the, western, front, left, tens, of, thousands, of, maimed, soldiers, and, war, widows, the, unprecedented, loss, of, life, had, a, lasting, effect, on, popular, attitudes, toward, war, resulting, later, in, an, allied, reluctance, to, pursue, an, aggressive, policy, toward, adolf, hitler, belgium, suffered, 30, 000, civilian, dead, and, france, 40, 000, including, 3, 000, merchant, sailors, the, british, lost, 16, 829, civilian, dead, 1, 260, civilians, were, killed, in, air, and, naval, attacks, 908, civilians, were, killed, at, sea, and, there, were, 14, 661, merchant, marine, deaths, another, 62, 000, belgian, 107, 000, british, and, 300, 000, french, civilians, died, due, to, war, related, causes, germany, in, 1919, was, bankrupt, the, people, living, in, a, state, of, semi, starvation, and, having, no, commerce, with, the, remainder, of, the, world, the, allies, occupied, the, rhine, cities, of, cologne, koblenz, and, mainz, with, restoration, dependent, on, payment, of, reparations, in, germany, a, stab, in, the, back, myth, dolchsto, legende, was, propagated, by, hindenburg, ludendorff, and, other, defeated, generals, that, the, defeat, was, not, the, fault, of, the, good, core, of, the, army, but, due, to, certain, left, wing, groups, within, germany, who, signed, a, disastrous, armistice, this, would, later, be, exploited, by, nationalists, and, the, nazi, party, propaganda, to, excuse, the, overthrow, of, the, weimar, republic, in, 1930, and, the, imposition, of, the, nazi, dictatorship, after, march, 1933, france, suffered, more, casualties, relative, to, its, population, than, any, other, great, power, and, the, industrial, north, east, of, the, country, was, devastated, by, the, war, the, provinces, overrun, by, germany, had, produced, 40, percent, of, french, coal, and, 58, percent, of, its, steel, output, once, it, was, clear, that, germany, was, going, to, be, defeated, ludendorff, had, ordered, the, destruction, of, the, mines, in, france, and, belgium, his, goal, was, to, cripple, the, industries, of, germany, s, main, european, rival, to, prevent, similar, german, attacks, in, the, future, france, later, built, a, massive, series, of, fortifications, along, the, german, border, known, as, the, maginot, line
