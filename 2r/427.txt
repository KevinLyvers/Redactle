signalled, a, desire, for, german, unification, in, this, period, was, the, burschenschaft, student, movement, by, students, who, encouraged, the, use, of, the, black, red, gold, flag, discussions, of, a, unified, german, nation, and, a, progressive, liberal, political, system, because, of, prussia, s, size, and, economic, importance, smaller, states, began, to, join, its, free, trade, area, in, the, 1820s, prussia, benefited, greatly, from, the, creation, in, 1834, of, the, german, customs, union, zollverein, which, included, most, german, states, but, excluded, austria, in, 1848, the, liberals, saw, an, opportunity, when, revolutions, broke, out, across, europe, alarmed, king, frederick, william, iv, agreed, to, convene, a, national, assembly, and, grant, a, constitution, when, the, frankfurt, parliament, offered, frederick, william, the, crown, of, a, united, germany, he, refused, on, the, grounds, that, he, would, not, accept, a, crown, from, a, revolutionary, assembly, without, the, sanction, of, germany, s, other, monarchs, the, frankfurt, parliament, was, forced, to, dissolve, in, 1849, and, frederick, william, issued, a, constitution, by, his, own, authority, in, 1850, this, conservative, document, provided, for, a, two, house, parliament, the, landtag, of, prussia, the, lower, house, or, prussian, house, of, representatives, was, elected, by, all, males, over, the, age, of, 25, they, were, divided, into, three, classes, whose, votes, were, weighted, according, to, the, amount, of, taxes, paid, in, one, typical, election, the, first, class, with, those, who, paid, the, most, in, taxes, included, 4, of, voters, and, the, third, class, with, those, who, paid, the, least, had, 82, yet, each, group, chose, the, same, number, of, electors, the, system, but, assured, dominance, by, the, more, well, to, do, men, of, the, population, the, upper, house, the, prussian, house, of, lords, was, appointed, by, the, king, he, retained, full, executive, authority, and, ministers, were, responsible, only, to, him, as, a, result, the, grip, of, the, landowning, classes, the, junkers, remained, unbroken, especially, in, the, eastern, provinces, the, constitution, nevertheless, contained, a, number, of, liberal, elements, such, as, the, introduction, of, jury, courts, and, a, catalog, of, fundamental, rights, that, included, freedom, of, religion, speech, and, the, press, in, 1862, king, wilhelm, i, appointed, otto, von, bismarck, as, minister, president, of, prussia, bismarck, was, determined, to, defeat, both, the, liberals, and, conservatives, and, increase, prussian, supremacy, and, influence, among, the, german, states, there, has, been, much, debate, as, to, whether, bismarck, actually, planned, to, create, a, united, germany, when, he, set, out, on, this, journey, or, whether, he, simply, took, advantage, of, the, circumstances, that, fell, into, place, bismarck, curried, support, from, large, sections, of, the, people, by, promising, to, lead, the, fight, for, greater, german, unification, he, successfully, guided, prussia, through, three, wars, which, unified, germany, and, brought, william, the, position, of, german, emperor, the, kingdom, of, denmark, was, at, the, time, in, personal, union, with, the, duchies, of, schleswig, and, holstein, both, of, which, had, close, ties, with, each, other, although, only, holstein, was, part, of, the, german, confederation, when, the, danish, government, tried, to, integrate, schleswig, but, not, holstein, into, the, danish, state, prussia, led, the, german, confederation, against, denmark, in, the, first, war, of, schleswig, 1848, 1851, because, russia, supported, austria, prussia, also, conceded, predominance, in, the, german, confederation, to, austria, in, the, punctation, of, olm, tz, in, 1850, resulting, in, a, return, to, the, status, quo, in, 1863, denmark, introduced, a, shared, constitution, for, denmark, and, schleswig, this, led, to, conflict, with, the, german, confederation, which, authorised, the, occupation, of, holstein, by, the, confederation, from, which, danish, forces, withdrew, in, 1864, prussian, and, austrian, forces, crossed, the, border, between, holstein, and, schleswig, initiating, the, second, war, of, schleswig, the, austro, prussian, forces, defeated, the, danes, who, surrendered, both, territories, in, the, resulting, gastein, convention, of, 1865, prussia, took, over, the, administration, of, schleswig, while, austria, assumed, that, of, holstein, bismarck, realised, that, the, dual, administration, of, schleswig, and, holstein, was, only, a, temporary, solution, and, tensions, rose, between, prussia, and, austria, the, struggle, for, supremacy, in, germany, then, led, to, the, austro, prussian, war, 1866, triggered, by, the, dispute, over, schleswig, and, holstein, with, bismarck, using, proposed, injustices, as, the, reason, for, war, on, the, austrian, side, stood, the, south, german, states, including, bavaria, and, w, rttemberg, some, central, german, states, including, saxony, and, hanover, in, the, north, on, the, side, of, prussia, were, italy, most, north, german, states, and, some, smaller, central, german, states, eventually, the, better, armed, prussian, troops, won, the, crucial, victory, at, the, battle, of, k, niggr, tz, under, helmuth, von, moltke, the, elder, the, century, long, struggle, between, berlin, and, vienna, for, the, dominance, of, germany, was, now, over, as, a, sideshow, in, this, war, prussia, defeated, hanover, in, the, battle, of, langensalza, 1866, while, hanover, hoped, in, vain, for, help, from, britain, as, they, had, previously, been, in, personal, union, britain, stayed, out, of, a, confrontation, with, a, continental, great, power, and, prussia, satisfied, its, desire, for, merging, the, once, separate, territories, and, gaining, strong, economic, and, strategic, power, particularly, from, the, full, access, to, the, resources, of, the, ruhr, bismarck, desired, austria, as, an, ally, in, the, future, and, so, he, declined, to, annex, any, austrian, territory, but, in, the, peace, of, prague, in, 1866, prussia, annexed, four, of, austria, s, allies, in, northern, and, central, germany, hanover, hesse, kassel, nassau, and, frankfurt, prussia, also, won, full, control, of, schleswig, holstein, as, a, result, of, these, territorial, gains, prussia, now, stretched, uninterrupted, across, the, northern, two, thirds, of, germany, and, contained, two, thirds, of, germany, s, population, the, german, confederation, was, dissolved, and, prussia, impelled, the, 21, states, north, of, the, main, river, into, forming, the, north, german, confederation, prussia, was, the, dominant, state, in, the, new, confederation, as, the, kingdom, comprised, almost, four, fifths, of, the, new, state, s, territory, and, population, prussia, s, near, total, control, over, the, confederation, was, secured, in, the, constitution, drafted, for, it, by, bismarck, in, 1867, executive, power, was, held, by, a, president, assisted, by, a, chancellor, responsible, only, to, him, the, presidency, was, a, hereditary, office, of, the, hohenzollern, rulers, of, prussia, there, was, also, a, two, house, parliament, the, lower, house, or, reichstag, diet, was, elected, by, universal, male, suffrage, the, upper, house, or, bundesrat, federal, council, was, appointed, by, the, state, governments, the, bundesrat, was, in, practice, the, stronger, chamber, prussia, had, 17, of, 43, votes, and, could, easily, control, proceedings, through, alliances, with, the, other, states, as, a, result, of, the, peace, negotiations, the, states, south, of, the, main, remained, theoretically, independent, but, received, the, compulsory, protection, of, prussia, additionally, mutual, defence, treaties, were, concluded, however, the, existence, of, these, treaties, was, kept, secret, until, bismarck, made, them, public, in, 1867, when, france, tried, to, acquire, luxembourg, the, controversy, with, the, second, french, empire, over, the, candidacy, of, leopold, prince, of, hohenzollern, to, the, spanish, throne, was, escalated, both, by, france, and, bismarck, with, his, ems, dispatch, bismarck, took, advantage, of, an, incident, in, which, the, french, ambassador, had, approached, william, the, government, of, napoleon, iii, expecting, another, civil, war, among, the, german, states, declared, war, against, prussia, continuing, franco, german, enmity, however, honouring, their, treaties, the, german, states, joined, forces, and, quickly, defeated, france, in, the, franco, prussian, war, in, 1870, following, victory, under, bismarck, s, and, prussia, s, leadership, baden, w, rttemberg, and, bavaria, which, had, remained, outside, the, north, german, confederation, accepted, incorporation, into, a, united, german, empire, the, empire, was, a, lesser, german, solution, in, german, kleindeutsche, l, sung, to, the, question, of, uniting, all, german, speaking, peoples, into, one, state, because, it, excluded, austria, which, remained, connected, to, hungary, and, whose, territories, included, non, german, populations, on, 18, january, 1871, the, 170th, anniversary, of, the, coronation, of, king, frederick, i, william, was, proclaimed, german, emperor, not, emperor, of, germany, in, the, hall, of, mirrors, at, versailles, outside, paris, while, the, french, capital, was, still, under, siege, the, two, decades, after, the, unification, of, germany, were, the, peak, of, prussia, s, fortunes, but, the, seeds, for, potential, strife, were, built, into, the, prusso, german, political, system, the, constitution, of, the, german, empire, was, a, version, of, the, north, german, confederation, s, constitution, officially, the, german, empire, was, a, federal, state, in, practice, prussia, overshadowed, the, rest, of, the, empire, prussia, included, three, fifths, of, the, german, territory, and, two, thirds, of, its, population, the, imperial, german, army, was, in, practice, an, enlarged, prussian, army, although, the, other, kingdoms, bavaria, saxony, and, w, rttemberg, retained, their, own, small, armies, coming, under, imperial, control, in, wartime, the, imperial, crown, was, a, hereditary, office, of, the, house, of, hohenzollern, the, royal, house, of, prussia, the, minister, president, of, prussia, was, except, for, two, brief, periods, january, november, 1873, and, 1892, 94, also, imperial, chancellor, but, the, empire, itself, had, no, right, to, collect, taxes, directly, from, its, subjects, the, only, incomes, fully, under, federal, control, were, the, customs, duties, common, excise, duties, and, the, revenue, from, postal, and, telegraph, services, while, all, men, above, age, 25, were, eligible, to, vote, in, imperial, elections, prussia, retained, its, restrictive, three, class, voting, system, this, effectively, required, the, king, emperor, and, prime, minister, chancellor, to, seek, majorities, from, legislatures, elected, by, two, different, franchises, in, both, the, kingdom, and, the, empire, the, original, constituencies, were, never, redrawn, to, reflect, changes, in, population, meaning, that, rural, areas, were, grossly, overrepresented, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, as, a, result, prussia, and, the, german, empire, were, something, of, a, paradox, bismarck, knew, that, his, new, german, empire, was, now, a, colossus, and, economically, and, militarily, dominant, in, europe, britain, was, still, dominant, in, finance, trade, and, at, sea, he, declared, germany, a, satisfied, power, using, his, talents, to, preserve, peace, for, example, at, the, congress, of, berlin, bismarck, did, not, set, up, his, own, party, he, had, mixed, success, in, some, of, his, domestic, policies, his, anti, catholic, kulturkampf, inside, prussia, and, not, the, wider, german, state, was, a, failure, he, ended, his, support, for, the, anticlerical, liberals, and, worked, instead, with, the, catholic, centre, party, he, tried, to, destroy, the, socialist, movement, with, limited, success, the, large, polish, population, resisted, germanisation, frederick, iii, became, emperor, in, march, 1888, after, the, death, of, his, father, but, he, died, of, cancer, only, 99, days, later, at, age, 29, wilhelm, became, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, after, a, difficult, youth, and, conflicts, with, his, british, mother, victoria, princess, royal, he, turned, out, to, be, a, man, of, limited, experience, narrow, and, reactionary, views, poor, judgment, and, occasional, bad, temper, which, alienated, former, friends, and, allies, prussia, nationalised, its, railways, in, the, 1880s, in, an, effort, both, to, lower, rates, on, freight, service, and, to, equalise, those, rates, among, shippers, instead, of, lowering, rates, as, far, as, possible, the, government, ran, the, railways, as, a, profit, making, endeavour, and, the, railway, profits, became, a, major, source, of, revenue, for, the, state, the, nationalisation, of, the, railways, slowed, the, economic, development, of, prussia, because, the, state, favoured, the, relatively, backward, agricultural, areas, in, its, railway, building, moreover, the, railway, surpluses, substituted, for, the, development, of, an, adequate, tax, system, because, of, the, german, revolution, of, 1918, wilhelm, ii, abdicated, as, german, emperor, and, king, of, prussia, prussia, was, proclaimed, a, free, state, i, e, a, republic, german, freistaat, within, the, new, weimar, republic, and, in, 1920, received, a, democratic, constitution, almost, all, of, germany, s, territorial, losses, specified, in, the, treaty, of, versailles, were, areas, that, had, been, part, of, prussia, eupen, and, malmedy, to, belgium, north, schleswig, to, denmark, the, memel, territory, to, lithuania, the, hultschin, area, to, czechoslovakia, many, of, the, areas, prussia, annexed, in, the, partitions, of, poland, such, as, the, provinces, of, posen, and, west, prussia, as, well, as, eastern, upper, silesia, went, to, the, second, polish, republic, danzig, became, the, free, city, of, danzig, under, the, administration, of, the, league, of, nations, also, the, saargebiet, was, created, mainly, from, formerly, prussian, territories, except, present, saarpfalz, district, which, was, part, of, the, kingdom, of, bavaria, east, prussia, became, an, exclave, only, reachable, by, ship, the, sea, service, east, prussia, or, by, a, railway, through, the, polish, corridor, the, german, government, seriously, considered, breaking, up, prussia, into, smaller, states, but, eventually, traditionalist, sentiment, prevailed, and, prussia, became, by, far, the, largest, state, of, the, weimar, republic, comprising, 60, of, its, territory, with, the, abolition, of, the, older, prussian, franchise, it, became, a, stronghold, of, the, left, its, incorporation, of, red, berlin, and, the, industrialised, ruhr, area, both, with, working, class, majorities, ensured, left, wing, dominance, from, 1919, to, 1932, prussia, was, governed, by, a, coalition, of, the, social, democrats, catholic, centre, and, german, democrats, from, 1921, to, 1925, coalition, governments, included, the, german, people, s, party, unlike, in, other, states, of, the, german, reich, majority, rule, by, democratic, parties, in, prussia, was, never, endangered, nevertheless, in, east, prussia, and, some, rural, areas, the, nazi, party, of, adolf, hitler, gained, more, and, more, influence, and, popular, support, especially, from, the, lower, middle, class, starting, in, 1930, except, for, catholic, upper, silesia, the, nazi, party, in, 1932, became, the, largest, party, in, most, parts, of, the, free, state, of, prussia, however, the, democratic, parties, in, coalition, remained, a, majority, while, communists, and, nazis, were, in, the, opposition, the, east, prussian, otto, braun, who, was, prussian, minister, president, almost, continuously, from, 1920, to, 1932, is, considered, one, of, the, most, capable, social, democrats, in, history, he, implemented, several, trend, setting, reforms, together, with, his, minister, of, the, interior, carl, severing, which, were, also, models, for, the, later, federal, republic, of, germany, for, instance, a, prussian, minister, president, could, be, forced, out, of, office, only, if, there, was, a, positive, majority, for, a, potential, successor, this, concept, known, as, the, constructive, vote, of, no, confidence, was, carried, over, into, the, basic, law, for, the, federal, republic, of, germany, most, historians, regard, the, prussian, government, during, this, time, as, far, more, successful, than, that, of, germany, as, a, whole, in, contrast, to, its, pre, war, authoritarianism, prussia, was, a, pillar, of, democracy, in, the, weimar, republic, this, system, was, destroyed, by, the, preu, enschlag, prussian, coup, of, reich, chancellor, franz, von, papen, in, this, coup, d, tat, the, government, of, the, reich, deposed, the, prussian, government, on, 20, july, 1932, under, the, pretext, that, the, latter, had, lost, control, of, public, order, in, prussia, during, the, bloody, sunday, of, altona, hamburg, which, was, still, part, of, prussia, at, that, time, and, by, using, fabricated, evidence, that, the, social, democrats, and, the, communists, were, planning, a, joint, putsch, the, defence, minister, general, kurt, von, schleicher, who, was, the, prime, mover, behind, the, coup, manufactured, evidence, that, the, prussian, police, under, braun, s, orders, were, favouring, the, communist, rotfrontk, mpferbund, in, street, clashes, with, the, sa, as, part, of, an, alleged, plan, to, foment, a, marxist, revolution, which, he, used, to, get, an, emergency, decree, from, president, paul, von, hindenburg, imposing, reich, control, on, prussia, papen, appointed, himself, reich, commissioner, for, prussia, and, took, control, of, the, government, the, preu, enschlag, made, it, easier, only, half, a, year, later, for, hitler, to, take, power, decisively, in, germany, since, he, had, the, whole, apparatus, of, the, prussian, government, including, the, police, at, his, disposal, after, the, appointment, of, hitler, as, the, new, chancellor, the, nazis, used, the, absence, of, franz, von, papen, as, an, opportunity, to, appoint, hermann, g, ring, federal, commissioner, for, the, prussian, ministry, of, the, interior, the, reichstag, election, of, 5, march, 1933, strengthened, the, position, of, the, national, socialist, german, workers, party, nsdap, or, nazi, party, although, they, did, not, achieve, an, absolute, majority, the, reichstag, building, having, been, set, on, fire, a, few, weeks, earlier, on, 27, february, a, new, reichstag, was, opened, in, the, garrison, church, of, potsdam, on, 21, march, 1933, in, the, presence, of, president, paul, von, hindenburg, in, a, propaganda, filled, meeting, between, hitler, and, the, nazi, party, the, marriage, of, old, prussia, with, young, germany, was, celebrated, to, win, over, the, prussian, monarchists, conservatives, and, nationalists, and, induce, them, into, supporting, and, subsequently, voting, in, favor, of, the, enabling, act, of, 1933, in, the, centralised, state, created, by, the, nazis, in, the, law, on, the, reconstruction, of, the, reich, gesetz, ber, den, neuaufbau, des, reichs, 30, january, 1934, and, the, law, on, reich, governors, reichsstatthaltergesetz, 30, january, 1935, the, states, were, dissolved, in, fact, if, not, in, law, the, state, landtage, were, abolished, and, the, state, governments, were, now, controlled, by, reichsstatthaltern, reich, governors, who, were, appointed, by, the, chancellor, parallel, to, that, the, organisation, of, the, party, into, districts, gaue, gained, increasing, importance, as, the, official, in, charge, of, a, gau, the, head, of, which, was, called, a, gauleiter, was, again, appointed, by, the, chancellor, who, was, at, the, same, time, chief, of, the, nazi, party, this, centralising, policy, went, even, further, in, prussia, from, 1934, to, 1945, almost, all, ministries, were, merged, and, only, a, few, departments, were, able, to, maintain, their, independence, hitler, himself, became, formally, the, governor, of, prussia, however, his, functions, were, exercised, by, hermann, g, ring, as, prussian, prime, minister, as, provided, for, in, the, greater, hamburg, act, gro, hamburg, gesetz, certain, exchanges, of, territory, took, place, prussia, was, extended, on, 1, april, 1937, for, instance, by, the, incorporation, of, the, free, and, hanseatic, city, of, l, beck, the, prussian, lands, transferred, to, poland, after, the, treaty, of, versailles, were, re, annexed, during, world, war, ii, however, most, of, this, territory, was, not, reintegrated, back, into, prussia, but, assigned, to, separate, gaue, of, danzig, west, prussia, and, wartheland, during, much, of, the, duration, of, the, war, the, areas, east, of, the, oder, neisse, line, mainly, eastern, prussia, western, prussia, pomerania, and, silesia, were, annexed, by, poland, and, the, soviet, union, in, 1945, owing, to, the, treaty, of, potsdam, between, three, of, the, allies, the, united, states, united, kingdom, and, the, soviet, union, this, included, important, prussian, cities, like, danzig, k, nigsberg, breslau, and, stettin, the, population, fled, mostly, to, the, western, zones, or, was, driven, out, as, part, of, their, wartime, goals, the, western, allies, sought, the, abolition, of, prussia, stalin, was, initially, content, to, retain, the, name, russians, having, a, different, historical, view, of, their, neighbour, and, sometime, former, ally, nonetheless, by, law, no, 46, which, was, accepted, and, implemented, by, the, allied, control, council, on, 25, february, 1947, prussia, was, officially, proclaimed, to, be, dissolved, in, the, soviet, occupation, zone, which, became, east, germany, officially, the, german, democratic, republic, in, 1949, the, former, prussian, territories, were, reorganised, into, the, states, of, brandenburg, and, saxony, anhalt, with, the, remaining, parts, of, the, province, of, pomerania, going, to, mecklenburg, western, pomerania, these, states, were, de, facto, abolished, in, 1952, in, favour, of, bezirke, districts, but, were, recreated, after, german, reunification, in, 1990, in, the, western, zones, of, occupation, which, became, west, germany, officially, the, federal, republic, of, germany, in, 1949, the, former, prussian, territories, were, divided, up, among, north, rhine, westphalia, lower, saxony, hesse, rhineland, palatinate, and, schleswig, holstein, w, rttemberg, baden, and, w, rttemberg, hohenzollern, were, later, merged, with, baden, to, create, the, state, of, baden, w, rttemberg, the, saar, region, which, had, been, administered, by, the, french, as, a, protectorate, separate, from, the, rest, of, western, germany, was, admitted, to, the, federal, republic, of, germany, as, a, separate, state, following, the, 1955, saar, statute, referendum, one, year, later, in, 1957, the, prussian, cultural, heritage, foundation, was, established, and, implemented, by, federal, statutes, in, west, germany, in, response, to, a, ruling, from, the, federal, constitutional, court, of, germany, the, fundamental, goal, of, this, institution, is, protecting, the, cultural, legacy, of, prussia, as, of, 2021, it, continues, to, operate, from, its, headquarters, in, berlin, in, the, mid, 16th, century, the, margraves, of, brandenburg, had, become, highly, dependent, on, the, estates, representing, counts, lords, knights, and, towns, but, not, prelates, owing, to, the, protestant, reformation, in, 1538, the, margraviate, s, liabilities, and, tax, income, as, well, as, the, margrave, s, finances, were, in, the, hands, of, the, kreditwerk, an, institution, not, controlled, by, the, elector, and, of, the, gro, er, ausschu, great, committee, of, the, estates, this, was, because, of, concessions, made, by, elector, joachim, ii, in, 1541, in, return, for, financial, aid, by, the, estates, however, the, kreditwerk, went, bankrupt, between, 1618, and, 1625, the, margraves, further, had, to, yield, to, the, veto, of, the, estates, in, all, issues, concerning, the, better, or, worse, of, the, country, in, all, legal, commitments, and, in, all, issues, concerning, pawn, or, sale, of, the, elector, s, real, property, to, reduce, the, influence, of, the, estates, in, 1604, joachim, frederick, created, a, council, called, geheimer, rat, f, r, die, kurmark, privy, council, for, the, electorate, which, instead, of, the, estates, would, function, as, the, supreme, advisory, council, for, the, elector, while, the, council, was, permanently, established, in, 1613, it, failed, to, gain, any, influence, until, 1651, owing, to, the, thirty, years, war, 1618, 1648, until, after, the, thirty, years, war,

local, estates, in, the, duchy, of, prussia, he, confirmed, the, traditional, privileges, of, the, prussian, estates, in, 1663, but, the, latter, accepted, the, caveat, that, these, privileges, were, not, to, be, used, to, interfere, with, the, exertion, of, the, elector, s, sovereignty, as, in, brandenburg, frederick, william, ignored, the, privilege, of, the, prussian, estates, to, confirm, or,
