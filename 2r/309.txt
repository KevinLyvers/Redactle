the, house, of, plantagenet, pl, n, t, d, n, t, plan, taj, n, t, was, a, royal, house, which, originated, in, the, french, county, of, anjou, the, name, plantagenet, is, used, by, modern, historians, to, identify, four, distinct, royal, houses, the, angevins, who, were, also, counts, of, anjou, the, main, line, of, the, plantagenets, following, the, loss, of, anjou, and, the, houses, of, lancaster, and, york, two, of, the, plantagenets, cadet, branches, the, family, held, the, english, throne, from, 1154, with, the, accession, of, henry, ii, until, 1485, when, richard, iii, died, england, was, transformed, under, the, plantagenets, although, only, partly, intentionally, the, plantagenet, kings, were, often, forced, to, negotiate, compromises, such, as, magna, carta, which, constrained, royal, power, in, return, for, financial, and, military, support, the, king, was, no, longer, just, the, most, powerful, man, in, the, nation, holding, the, prerogative, of, judgement, feudal, tribute, and, warfare, but, had, defined, duties, to, the, realm, underpinned, by, a, sophisticated, justice, system, a, distinct, national, identity, was, shaped, by, their, conflict, with, the, french, scots, welsh, and, irish, as, well, as, by, the, establishment, of, middle, english, as, the, primary, language, in, the, 15th, century, the, plantagenets, were, defeated, in, the, hundred, years, war, and, beset, with, social, political, and, economic, problems, popular, revolts, were, commonplace, triggered, by, the, denial, of, numerous, freedoms, english, nobles, raised, private, armies, engaged, in, private, feuds, and, openly, defied, henry, vi, the, rivalry, between, the, house, of, plantagenet, s, two, cadet, branches, of, york, and, lancaster, brought, about, the, wars, of, the, roses, a, decades, long, fight, for, the, english, succession, it, culminated, in, the, battle, of, bosworth, field, in, 1485, when, the, reign, of, the, plantagenets, and, the, english, middle, ages, both, met, their, end, with, the, death, of, king, richard, iii, henry, vii, a, lancastrian, became, king, of, england, five, months, later, he, married, elizabeth, of, york, thus, ending, the, wars, of, the, roses, and, giving, rise, to, the, tudor, dynasty, the, tudors, worked, to, centralise, english, royal, power, which, allowed, them, to, avoid, some, of, the, problems, that, had, plagued, the, last, plantagenet, rulers, the, resulting, stability, allowed, for, the, english, renaissance, and, the, advent, of, early, modern, britain, every, english, and, later, united, kingdom, monarch, from, henry, vii, to, present, has, been, a, descendant, of, the, plantagenets, in, the, 15th, century, near, the, end, of, the, dynastic, line, richard, of, york, 3rd, duke, of, york, adopted, plantagenet, as, his, family, name, plantegenest, or, plante, genest, had, been, a, 12th, century, nickname, for, his, ancestor, geoffrey, count, of, anjou, and, duke, of, normandy, one, of, many, popular, theories, suggests, the, blossom, of, the, common, broom, a, bright, yellow, gold, flowering, plant, called, genista, in, medieval, latin, as, the, source, of, the, nickname, it, is, uncertain, why, richard, of, york, chose, this, specific, name, although, during, the, wars, of, the, roses, 1455, 1487, it, emphasised, richard, s, status, as, geoffrey, s, patrilineal, descendant, the, retrospective, usage, of, the, name, for, all, of, geoffrey, s, male, line, descendants, was, popular, during, the, subsequent, tudor, dynasty, perhaps, encouraged, by, the, further, legitimacy, it, gave, to, richard, s, great, grandson, henry, viii, it, was, only, in, the, late, 17th, century, that, it, passed, into, common, usage, among, historians, angevin, is, french, for, of, anjou, the, three, angevin, kings, were, the, 12th, century, geoffrey, of, anjou, s, son, henry, ii, and, grandsons, richard, i, and, john, noble, houses, were, regularly, denominated, by, a, territory, or, place, of, birth, eg, house, of, normandy, house, of, wessex, angevin, can, also, refer, to, the, period, of, history, in, which, they, reigned, many, historians, identify, the, angevins, as, a, distinct, english, royal, house, angevin, is, also, used, in, reference, to, any, sovereign, or, government, derived, from, anjou, as, a, noun, it, refers, to, any, native, of, anjou, or, an, angevin, ruler, and, specifically, to, other, counts, and, dukes, of, anjou, including, the, ancestors, of, the, three, kings, who, formed, the, english, royal, house, their, cousins, who, held, the, crown, of, jerusalem, and, to, unrelated, members, of, the, french, royal, family, who, were, later, granted, the, titles, and, formed, different, dynasties, such, as, the, capetian, house, of, anjou, and, the, valois, house, of, anjou, consequently, there, is, disagreement, between, those, who, consider, john, s, son, henry, iii, to, be, the, first, plantagenet, monarch, and, those, who, do, not, distinguish, between, angevins, and, plantagenets, and, therefore, consider, the, first, plantagenet, to, be, henry, ii, the, term, angevin, empire, was, coined, by, kate, norgate, in, 1887, there, was, no, known, contemporary, collective, name, for, all, of, the, territories, under, the, rule, of, the, angevin, kings, of, england, this, led, to, circumlocutions, such, as, our, kingdom, and, everything, subject, to, our, rule, whatever, it, may, be, or, the, whole, of, the, kingdom, which, had, belonged, to, his, father, the, empire, portion, of, angevin, empire, has, been, controversial, especially, as, these, territories, were, not, subject, to, any, unified, laws, or, systems, of, governance, and, each, retained, its, own, laws, traditions, and, feudal, relationships, in, 1986, a, convention, of, historians, concluded, that, there, had, not, been, an, angevin, state, and, therefore, no, angevin, empire, but, that, the, term, espace, plantagenet, french, for, plantagenet, area, was, acceptable, nonetheless, historians, have, continued, to, use, angevin, empire, the, later, counts, of, anjou, including, the, plantagenets, descended, from, geoffrey, ii, count, of, g, tinais, and, his, wife, ermengarde, of, anjou, in, 1060, the, couple, inherited, the, title, via, cognatic, kinship, from, an, angevin, family, that, was, descended, from, a, noble, named, ingelger, whose, recorded, history, dates, from, 870, during, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, power, struggles, occurred, between, rulers, in, northern, and, western, france, including, those, of, anjou, normandy, brittany, poitou, blois, and, maine, and, the, kings, of, france, in, the, early, 12th, century, geoffrey, of, anjou, married, empress, matilda, king, henry, i, s, only, surviving, legitimate, child, and, heir, to, the, english, throne, from, the, house, of, normandy, as, a, result, of, this, marriage, geoffrey, s, son, henry, ii, inherited, the, english, throne, as, well, as, norman, and, angevin, titles, thus, marking, the, beginning, of, the, angevin, and, plantagenet, dynasties, the, marriage, was, the, third, attempt, of, geoffrey, s, father, fulk, v, count, of, anjou, to, build, a, political, alliance, with, normandy, he, first, espoused, his, daughter, matilda, to, william, adelin, henry, i, s, heir, after, william, drowned, in, the, wreck, of, the, white, ship, fulk, married, another, of, his, daughters, sibylla, to, william, clito, son, of, henry, i, s, older, brother, robert, curthose, henry, i, had, the, marriage, annulled, to, avoid, strengthening, william, s, rival, claim, to, normandy, finally, fulk, achieved, his, goal, through, the, marriage, of, geoffrey, and, matilda, fulk, then, passed, his, titles, to, geoffrey, and, became, king, of, jerusalem, when, henry, ii, was, born, in, 1133, his, maternal, grandfather, henry, i, was, reportedly, delighted, saying, that, the, boy, was, the, heir, to, the, kingdom, the, birth, reduced, the, risk, that, the, king, s, realm, would, pass, to, his, son, in, law, s, family, which, was, possible, if, the, marriage, of, matilda, and, geoffrey, ended, childless, the, birth, of, a, second, son, also, named, geoffrey, increased, the, likelihood, of, partible, inheritance, following, french, custom, in, which, henry, would, receive, the, english, maternal, inheritance, and, geoffrey, the, angevin, paternal, inheritance, this, would, separate, the, realms, of, england, and, anjou, in, order, to, secure, an, orderly, succession, geoffrey, and, matilda, sought, more, power, from, henry, i, but, quarrelled, with, him, after, the, king, refused, to, give, them, power, that, might, be, used, against, him, when, he, died, in, december, 1135, the, couple, were, in, anjou, allowing, matilda, s, cousin, stephen, to, seize, the, crown, of, england, stephen, s, contested, accession, initiated, the, widespread, civil, unrest, later, called, the, anarchy, count, geoffrey, had, little, interest, in, england, instead, he, commenced, a, ten, year, war, for, the, duchy, of, normandy, but, it, became, clear, that, to, bring, this, conflict, to, a, successful, conclusion, stephen, would, need, to, be, challenged, in, england, in, 1139, matilda, and, her, half, brother, robert, invaded, england, from, the, age, of, nine, henry, was, repeatedly, sent, to, england, to, be, the, male, figurehead, of, the, campaigns, since, it, became, apparent, that, he, would, become, king, if, england, were, conquered, in, 1141, stephen, was, captured, at, the, battle, of, lincoln, and, later, exchanged, for, robert, who, had, also, been, captured, geoffrey, continued, the, conquest, of, normandy, and, in, 1150, transferred, the, duchy, to, henry, while, retaining, the, primary, role, in, the, duchy, s, government, three, events, allowed, the, angevins, successful, termination, of, the, conflict, of, henry, s, siblings, william, and, geoffrey, died, unmarried, and, childless, but, the, tempestuous, marriage, of, henry, and, eleanor, who, already, had, two, daughters, marie, and, alix, through, her, first, marriage, to, king, louis, produced, eight, children, in, thirteen, years, henry, also, had, illegitimate, children, with, several, mistresses, possibly, as, many, as, twelve, these, children, included, geoffrey, william, peter, and, four, children, who, died, young, by, alys, the, daughter, of, louis, vii, while, she, was, betrothed, to, his, son, richard, william, s, many, competencies, and, importance, as, a, royal, bastard, led, to, a, long, and, illustrious, career, henry, reasserted, and, extended, previous, suzerainties, to, secure, possession, of, his, inherited, realm, in, 1162, he, attempted, to, re, establish, what, he, saw, as, his, authority, over, the, english, church, by, appointing, his, friend, thomas, becket, as, archbishop, of, canterbury, upon, the, death, of, the, incumbent, archbishop, theobald, becket, s, defiance, as, archbishop, alienated, the, king, and, his, counsellors, henry, and, becket, had, repeated, disputes, over, issues, such, as, church, tenures, the, marriage, of, henry, s, brother, and, taxation, henry, reacted, by, getting, becket, and, other, english, bishops, to, recognise, sixteen, ancient, customs, in, writing, for, the, first, time, in, the, constitutions, of, clarendon, governing, relations, between, the, king, his, courts, and, the, church, when, becket, tried, to, leave, the, country, without, permission, henry, tried, to, ruin, him, by, filing, legal, cases, relating, to, becket, s, previous, tenure, as, chancellor, becket, fled, and, remained, in, exile, for, five, years, relations, later, improved, and, becket, returned, but, they, declined, again, when, henry, s, son, was, crowned, as, coregent, by, the, archbishop, of, york, which, becket, perceived, as, a, challenge, to, his, authority, becket, later, excommunicated, those, who, had, offended, him, when, he, received, this, news, henry, said, what, miserable, drones, and, traitors, have, i, nurtured, and, promoted, in, my, household, who, let, their, lord, be, treated, with, such, shameful, contempt, by, a, low, born, clerk, four, of, henry, s, knights, killed, becket, in, canterbury, cathedral, after, becket, resisted, a, failed, arrest, attempt, henry, was, widely, considered, complicit, in, becket, s, death, throughout, christian, europe, this, made, henry, a, pariah, in, penance, he, walked, barefoot, into, canterbury, cathedral, where, he, was, severely, whipped, by, monks, from, 1155, henry, claimed, that, pope, adrian, iv, had, given, him, authorisation, to, reform, the, irish, church, by, assuming, control, of, ireland, but, professor, anne, duggan, s, research, indicates, that, the, laudabiliter, is, a, falsification, of, an, existing, letter, and, that, was, not, in, fact, adrian, s, intention, it, originally, allowed, henry, s, brother, william, some, territory, henry, did, not, personally, act, on, this, until, 1171, by, which, time, william, was, already, dead, he, invaded, ireland, to, assert, his, authority, over, knights, who, had, accrued, autonomous, power, after, they, recruited, soldiers, in, england, and, wales, and, colonised, ireland, with, his, permission, henry, later, gave, ireland, to, his, youngest, son, john, in, 1172, henry, gave, john, the, castles, of, chinon, loudun, and, mirebeau, as, a, wedding, gift, this, angered, henry, s, eighteen, year, old, son, henry, the, young, king, who, believed, that, those, were, his, a, rebellion, by, henry, ii, s, wife, and, three, eldest, sons, ensued, louis, vii, of, france, supported, the, rebellion, william, the, lion, king, of, the, scots, and, others, joined, the, revolt, after, eighteen, months, henry, subdued, the, rebels, in, le, mans, in, 1182, henry, ii, gathered, his, children, to, plan, a, partible, inheritance, his, eldest, surviving, son, henry, would, inherit, england, normandy, and, anjou, richard, his, mother, s, favourite, would, inherit, the, duchy, of, aquitaine, geoffrey, would, inherit, brittany, and, john, would, inherit, ireland, this, resulted, in, further, conflict, the, younger, henry, rebelled, again, but, died, of, dysentery, geoffrey, died, in, 1186, after, an, accident, in, a, tournament, in, 1189, richard, and, philip, ii, of, france, reasserted, their, various, claims, exploiting, the, aging, henry, s, failing, health, henry, was, forced, to, accept, humiliating, peace, terms, including, naming, richard, his, sole, heir, the, old, king, died, two, days, later, defeated, and, miserable, french, and, english, contemporary, moralists, viewed, this, fate, as, retribution, for, the, murder, of, becket, even, his, favourite, legitimate, son, john, had, rebelled, although, the, constantly, loyal, illegitimate, son, geoffrey, remained, with, henry, until, the, end, following, richard, s, coronation, he, quickly, put, the, kingdom, s, affairs, in, order, and, departed, on, a, crusade, for, the, middle, east, opinion, of, richard, has, fluctuated, he, was, respected, for, his, military, leadership, and, courtly, manners, he, rejected, and, humiliated, the, sister, of, the, king, of, france, he, deposed, the, king, of, cyprus, and, later, sold, the, island, on, the, third, crusade, he, made, an, enemy, of, leopold, v, duke, of, austria, by, showing, disrespect, to, his, banners, as, well, as, refusing, to, share, the, spoils, of, war, he, was, rumoured, to, have, arranged, the, assassination, of, conrad, of, montferrat, his, ruthlessness, was, demonstrated, by, his, massacre, of, 2, 600, prisoners, in, acre, he, obtained, victories, during, the, third, crusade, but, failed, to, capture, jerusalem, according, to, steven, runciman, richard, was, a, bad, son, a, bad, husband, and, a, bad, king, jonathan, riley, smith, described, him, as, vain, devious, and, self, centred, in, an, alternate, view, john, gillingham, points, out, that, for, centuries, richard, was, considered, a, model, king, returning, from, the, crusade, with, a, small, band, of, followers, richard, was, captured, by, leopold, and, was, passed, to, emperor, henry, vi, henry, held, richard, captive, for, eighteen, months, 1192, 1194, while, his, mother, raised, the, ransom, valued, at, 100, 000, marks, in, richard, s, absence, philip, ii, overran, large, portions, of, normandy, and, john, acquired, control, of, richard, s, english, lands, after, returning, to, england, richard, forgave, john, and, re, established, his, authority, in, england, he, left, again, in, 1194, and, battled, philip, for, five, years, attempting, to, regain, the, lands, seized, during, his, captivity, when, close, to, complete, victory, he, was, injured, by, an, arrow, during, a, siege, and, died, ten, days, later, richard, s, failure, to, provide, an, heir, caused, a, succession, crisis, and, conflict, between, supporters, of, the, claim, of, his, nephew, arthur, and, john, guillaume, des, roches, led, the, magnates, of, anjou, maine, and, touraine, declaring, for, arthur, once, again, philip, ii, of, france, attempted, to, disturb, the, plantagenet, territories, on, the, european, mainland, by, supporting, his, vassal, arthur, s, claim, to, the, english, crown, john, won, a, significant, victory, while, preventing, arthur, s, forces, from, capturing, his, mother, seizing, the, entire, rebel, leadership, at, the, battle, of, mirebeau, and, his, sister, eleanor, fair, maid, of, brittany, john, disregarded, his, allies, opinions, on, the, fate, of, the, prisoners, many, of, them, their, neighbours, and, kinsmen, instead, he, kept, his, prisoners, so, vilely, and, in, such, evil, distress, that, it, seemed, shameful, and, ugly, to, all, those, who, were, with, him, and, who, saw, this, cruelty, according, to, the, histoire, de, guillaume, le, mar, chal, as, a, result, of, john, s, behaviour, the, powerful, thouars, lusignan, and, des, roches, families, rebelled, and, john, lost, control, of, anjou, maine, touraine, and, northern, poitou, his, son, king, henry, iii, maintained, the, claim, to, the, angevin, territories, until, december, 1259, when, he, formally, surrendered, them, and, in, return, was, granted, gascony, as, duke, of, aquitaine, and, a, vassal, of, the, king, of, france, john, s, reputation, was, further, damaged, by, the, rumour, described, in, the, margam, annals, that, while, drunk, he, himself, had, murdered, arthur, and, if, not, true, it, is, almost, certain, john, ordered, the, killing, there, are, two, contrasting, schools, of, thought, explaining, the, sudden, collapse, of, john, s, position, sir, james, holt, suggests, this, was, the, inevitable, result, of, superior, french, resources, john, gillingham, identifies, diplomatic, and, military, mismanagement, and, points, out, that, richard, managed, to, hold, the, angevin, territory, with, comparable, finances, nick, barratt, has, calculated, that, angevin, resources, available, for, use, in, the, war, were, 22, per, cent, less, than, those, of, philip, putting, the, angevins, at, a, disadvantage, by, 1214, john, had, re, established, his, authority, in, england, and, planned, what, gillingham, has, called, a, grand, strategy, to, recapture, normandy, and, anjou, the, plan, was, that, john, would, draw, the, french, from, paris, while, another, army, under, his, nephew, otto, iv, the, holy, roman, emperor, and, his, half, brother, william, attacked, from, the, north, he, also, brought, his, niece, eleanor, of, brittany, aiming, to, establish, her, as, duchess, of, brittany, the, plan, failed, when, john, s, allies, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, bouvines, otto, retreated, and, was, soon, overthrown, william, was, captured, by, the, french, and, john, agreed, to, a, five, year, truce, from, then, on, john, also, gave, up, the, claim, to, brittany, of, eleanor, and, had, her, confined, for, life, john, s, defeat, weakened, his, authority, in, england, and, his, barons, forced, him, to, agree, to, magna, carta, in, 1215, which, limited, royal, power, both, sides, failed, to, abide, by, the, terms, of, magna, carta, leading, to, the, first, barons, war, in, which, rebellious, barons, invited, prince, louis, the, husband, of, blanche, henry, ii, s, granddaughter, to, invade, england, louis, did, so, but, in, october, 1216, before, the, conflict, was, conclusively, ended, john, died, the, official, website, of, the, british, monarchy, presents, john, s, death, as, the, end, of, the, angevin, dynasty, and, the, beginning, of, the, plantagenet, dynasty, all, subsequent, english, monarchs, were, descendants, of, the, angevin, line, via, john, who, had, five, legitimate, children, with, isabella, john, also, had, illegitimate, children, with, several, mistresses, these, children, probably, included, nine, sons, called, richard, oliver, henry, osbert, gifford, geoffrey, john, fitzjohn, or, courcy, odo, or, eudes, fitzroy, ivo, henry, richard, the, constable, of, wallingford, castle, and, three, daughters, called, joan, matilda, the, abbess, of, barking, and, isabella, la, blanche, joan, was, the, best, known, of, these, since, she, married, prince, llewelyn, the, great, of, wales, william, marshal, 1st, earl, of, pembroke, was, appointed, regent, for, the, nine, year, old, king, henry, on, king, john, s, death, thereafter, support, for, louis, declined, and, he, renounced, his, claims, in, the, treaty, of, lambeth, after, marshal, s, victories, at, the, battles, of, lincoln, and, sandwich, in, 1217, the, marshal, regime, issued, an, amended, magna, carta, as, a, basis, for, future, government, despite, the, treaty, of, lambeth, hostilities, continued, and, henry, was, forced, to, compromise, with, the, newly, crowned, louis, viii, of, france, and, henry, s, stepfather, hugh, x, of, lusignan, they, both, overran, much, of, henry, s, remaining, continental, lands, further, eroding, the, angevins, power, on, the, continent, in, his, political, struggles, henry, perceived, many, similarities, between, himself, and, england, s, patron, saint, edward, the, confessor, consequently, he, named, his, first, son, edward, and, built, the, existing, magnificent, shrine, for, the, confessor, in, early, 1225, a, great, council, approved, a, tax, of, 40, 000, to, dispatch, an, army, which, quickly, retook, gascony, during, an, assembly, feudal, prerogatives, of, the, king, were, challenged, by, the, barons, bishops, and, magnates, who, demanded, that, the, king, reissue, magna, carta, and, the, charter, of, the, forest, in, exchange, for, support, henry, declared, that, the, charters, were, issued, of, his, own, spontaneous, and, free, will, and, confirmed, them, with, the, royal, seal, giving, the, new, great, charter, and, the, charter, of, the, forest, of, 1225, much, more, authority, than, any, previous, versions, henry, iii, had, nine, children, henry, was, bankrupted, by, his, military, expenditure, and, general, extravagance, the, pope, offered, henry, s, brother, richard, the, kingdom, of, sicily, but, the, military, cost, of, displacing, the, incumbent, emperor, frederick, was, prohibitive, matthew, paris, wrote, that, richard, stated, you, might, as, well, say, i, make, you, a, present, of, the, moon, step, up, to, the, sky, and, take, it, down, instead, henry, purchased, the, kingdom, for, his, son, edmund, which, angered, many, powerful, barons, the, barons, led, by, henry, s, brother, in, law, simon, de, montfort, forced, him, to, agree, to, the, provisions, of, oxford, under, which, his, debts, were, paid, in, exchange, for, substantial, reforms, in, france, with, the, treaty, of, paris, henry, formally, surrendered, the, territory, of, his, angevin, ancestors, to, louis, ix, of, france, receiving, in, return, the, title, duke, of, aquitaine, and, the, territory, of, gascony, as, a, vassal, of, the, french, king, disagreements, between, the, barons, and, the, king, intensified, the, barons, under,

and, taken, prisoner, de, montfort, assembled, the, great, parliament, recognized, as, the, first, parliament, because, it, was, the, first, time, the, cities, and, boroughs, had, sent, representatives, edward, escaped, raised, an, army, and, defeated, and, killed, de, montfort, at, the, battle, of, evesham, in, 1265, savage, retribution, was, inflicted, upon, the, rebels, and, authority, restored, to, henry, with, the, realm, now, peaceful, edward, left, england, to, join, louis, ix, on, the, ninth, crusade, he, was, one, of, the, last, crusaders, louis, died, before, edward, s, arrival, but, edward, decided, to, continue, the, result, was, disappointing, edward, s, small, force, only, enabled, him, to, capture, acre, and, launch, a, handful, of, raids, after,

and, determination, is, likely, to, have, come, from, the, king, and, his, experience, of, the, baronial, reform, movement, of, the, late, 1250s, and, early, 1260s, with, the, statutes, of, mortmain,

edward, on, the, grounds, that, he, was, a, matrilineal, grandson, of, philip, iv, of, france, however, the, precedents, set, by, philip, v, s, succession, over, his, niece, joan, ii, of, navarre, and, charles, iv, s, succession, over, his, nieces, meant, that, the, senior, grandson, of, philip, iii, in, the, male, line, phillip, of, valois, became, king, not, yet, in, power, edward, paid, homage, to, phillip, as, duke, of, aquitaine, in, 1337, phillip, confiscated, aquitaine, and, ponthieu, from, edward, alleging, he, was, harbouring, phillip, s, fugitive, cousin, and, enemy, robert, of, artois, in, response, edward, proclaimed, himself, king, of, france, to, encourage, the, flemish, to, rise, in, open, rebellion, against, the, french, king, the, conflict, later, known, as, the, hundred, years, war, included, a, significant, english, naval, victory, at, the, battle, of, sluys, and, a, victory, on, land, at, cr, cy, leaving, edward, free, to, capture, the, important, port, of, calais, a, subsequent, victory, against, scotland, at, the, battle, of, neville, s, cross, resulted, in, the, capture, of, david, ii, and, reduced, the, threat, from, scotland, the, black, death, brought, a, halt, to, edward, s, campaigns, by, killing, perhaps, a, third, of, his, subjects, the, only, plantagenet, known, to, have, died, from, the, black, death, was, edward, iii, s, daughter, joan, in, bordeaux, edward, the, black, prince, resumed, the, war, with, destructive, chevauch, es, starting, from, bordeaux, his, army, was, caught, by, a, much, larger, french, force, at, poitiers, but, the, ensuing, battle, was, a, decisive, english, victory, resulting, in, the, capture, of, john, ii, of, france, john, agreed, to, a, treaty, promising, the, french, would, pay, a, four, million, cus, ransom, the, subsequent, treaty, of, br, tigny, was, demonstrably, popular, in, england, where, it, was, both, ratified, in, parliament, and, celebrated, with, great, ceremony, to, reach, agreement, clauses, were, removed, that, would, have, had, edward, renounce, his, claim, to, the, french, crown, in, return, for, territory, in, aquitaine, and, the, town, of, calais, these, were, entered, in, another, agreement, to, be, effected, only, after, the, transfer, of, territory, by, november, 1361, but, both, sides, prevaricated, over, their, commitments, for, the, following, nine, years, hostages, from, the, valois, family, were, held, in, london, while, john, returned, to, france, to, raise, his, ransom, edward, had, restored, the, lands, of, the, former, angevin, empire, holding, normandy, brittany, anjou, maine, and, the, coastline, from, flanders, to, spain, when, the, hostages, escaped, back, to, france, john, was, horrified, that, his, word, had, been, broken, and, returned, to, england, where, he, eventually, died, fighting, in, the, hundred, years, war, spilled, from, the, french, and, plantagenet, lands, into, surrounding, realms, including, the, dynastic, conflict, in, castile, between, peter, of, castile, and, henry, ii, of, castile, the, black, prince, allied, himself, with, peter, defeating, henry, at, the, battle, of, n, jera, edward, and, peter, fell, out, when, peter, was, unable, to, reimburse, edward, s, military, expenses, leaving, him, bankrupt, the, plantagenets, continued, to, interfere, and, john, of, gaunt, 1st, duke, of, lancaster, the, black, prince, s, brother, married, peter, s, daughter, constance, claiming, the, crown, of, castile, in, her, name, he, invaded, with, an, army, of, 5, 000, men, however, fighting, was, inconclusive, before, gaunt, agreed, to, a, treaty, with, king, juan, of, castile, terms, of, the, treaty, included, the, marriage, of, john, of, gaunt, s, daughter, katherine, to, juan, s, son,

councils, his, government, levied, poll, taxes, to, finance, military, campaigns, which, combined, with, the, poor, state, of, the, economy, resulted, in, the, peasants, revolt, in, 1381, followed, by, brutal, reprisals, against, the, rebels, the, king, s, uncle, thomas, of, woodstock, 1st, duke, of, gloucester, richard, fitzalan, 11th, earl, of, arundel, and, thomas, de, beauchamp, 12th, earl, of, warwick, became, known, as, the, lords, appellant, when, they, sought, to, impeach, five, of, the, king, s, favourites, and, restrain, what, was, increasingly, seen, as, tyrannical, and, capricious, rule, later, they, were, joined, by, henry, bolingbroke, the, son, and, heir, of, john, of, gaunt, and, thomas, de, mowbray, 1st, duke, of, norfolk, initially, they, were, successful, in, establishing, a, commission, to, govern, england, for, one, year, but, they, were, forced, to, rebel, against, richard, defeating, an, army, under, robert, de, vere, earl, of, oxford, at, the, skirmish, of, radcot, bridge, richard, was, reduced, to, a, figurehead, with, little, power, as, a, result, of, the, merciless, parliament, de, vere, and, michael, de, la, pole, 1st, earl, of, suffolk, who, had, fled, abroad, were, sentenced, to, death, in, their, absence, alexander, neville, archbishop, of, york, had, all, his, possessions, confiscated, several, of, richard, s, council,

that, quickly, grew, in, numbers, meeting, little, resistance, henry, deposed, richard, to, have, himself, crowned, henry, iv, of, england, richard, died, in, captivity, early, the, next, year, probably, murdered, bringing, an, end, to, the, main, plantagenet, line, none, of, henry, s, heirs, were, free, from, challenge, on, the, grounds, of, not, being, the, true, heir, of, richard, ii, and, that, the, lancastrian, dynasty, had, gained, the, throne, by, an, act, of, usurpation, henry, married, his, plantagenet, cousin, mary, de, bohun, who, was, paternally, descended, from, edward, i, and, maternally, from, edmund, crouchback, they, had, seven, children, henry, went, to, convoluted, legal, means, to, justify, his, succession, many, lancastrians, asserted, that, his, mother, had, had, legitimate, rights, through, her, descent, from, edmund, crouchback, who, it, was, claimed, was, the, elder, son, of, henry, iii, of, england, set, aside, due, to, deformity, as, the, great, grandson, of, lionel, of, antwerp, 1st, duke, of, clarence, edmund, mortimer, earl, of, march, was, the, heir, presumptive, to, richard, ii, and, henry, used, multiple, rationales, stressing, his, plantagenet, descent, divine, grace, powerful, friends, and, richard, s, misgovernment, in, fact, mortimer, never, showed, interest, in, the, throne, the, later, marriage, of, his, sister, anne, to, richard, of, conisburgh, 3rd, earl, of, cambridge, consolidated, this, claim, to, the, throne, with, that, of, the, more, junior, house, of, york, henry, planned, to, resume, war, with, france, but, was, plagued, with, financial, problems, declining, health, and, frequent, rebellions, he, defeated, a, scottish, invasion, a, serious, rebellion, by, henry, percy, 1st, earl, of, northumberland, in, the, north, and, owain, glynd, r, s, rebellion, in, wales, many, saw, it, as, a, punishment, from, god, when, henry, was, later, struck, down, with, unknown, but, chronic, illnesses, henry, iv, died, in, 1413, his, son, and, successor, henry, v, of, england, aware, that, charles, vi, of, france, s, mental, illness, had, caused, instability, in, france, invaded, to, assert, the, plantagenet, claims, and, won, a, near, total, victory, over, the, french, at, the, battle, of, agincourt, in, subsequent, years, henry, recaptured, much, of, normandy, and, secured, marriage, to, catherine, of, valois, the, resulting, treaty, of, troyes, stated, that, henry, s, heirs, would, inherit, the, throne, of, france, but, conflict, continued, with, the, dauphin, when, henry, v, died, in, 1422, his, nine, month, old, son, succeeded, him, as, henry, vi, of, england, during, the, minority, of, henry, vi, the, war, caused, political, division, among, his, plantagenet, uncles, bedford, humphrey, of,

predicted, a, serious, illness, would, endanger, henry, vi, s, life, and, humphrey, was, later, arrested, and, died, in, prison, depopulation, stemming, from, the, black, death, led, to, increased, wages, static, food, costs, and, a, resulting, improvement, in, the, standard, of, living, for, the, peasantry, however, under, henry, misgovernment, and, harvest, failures, depressed, the, english, economy, to, a, pitiful, state, known, as, the, great, slump, the, economy, was, in, ruins, by, 1450, a, consequence, of, the, loss, of, france, piracy, in, the, channel, and, poor, trading, relations, with, the, hanseatic, league, the, economic, slowdown, began, in, the, 1430s, in, the, north, of, the, country, spreading, south, in, the, 1440s, with, the, economy, not, recovering, until, the, 1480s, it, was, also, driven, by, multiple, harvest, failures, in, the, 1430s, and, disease, amongst, livestock, which, drove, up, the, price, of, food, and, damaged, the, wider, economy, certain, groups, were, particularly, badly, affected, cloth, exports, fell, by, 35, per, cent, in, just, four, years, at, the, end, of, the, 1440s, collapsing, by, up, to, 90, per, cent, in, some, parts, of, the, south, west, the, crown, s, debts, reached, 372, 000, henry, s, deficit, was, 20, 000, per, annum, and, tax, revenues, were, half, those, of, his, father, richard, ii, made, his,

sister, of, constance, of, castile, who, was, the, second, wife, of, edmund, s, brother, john, of, gaunt, both, of, edmund, s, sons, were, killed, in, 1415, the, younger, richard, became, involved, in, the, southampton, plot, a, conspiracy, to, depose, henry, v, in, favour, of, richard, s, brother, in, law, edmund, mortimer, when, mortimer, revealed, the, plot, to, the, king, richard, was, executed, for, treason, richard, s, childless, older, brother, edward, was, killed, at, the, battle, of, agincourt, later, the, same, year, constance, of, york, was, edmund, s, only, daughter, and, was, an, ancestor, of, queen, anne, neville, the, increasingly, interwoven, plantagenet, relationships, were, demonstrated, by, edmund, s, second, marriage, to, joan, holland, her, sister, alianore,

richard, was, married, to, anne, mortimer, the, daughter, of, roger, mortimer, 4th, earl, of, march, and, eleanor, holland, and, great, granddaughter, of, edward, iii, s, second, surviving, son,

son, who, was, also, called, richard, although, his, earldom, was, forfeited, richard, the, father, was, not, attainted, and, the, four, year, old, orphan, richard, was, his, heir, within, months, of, his, father, s, death, richard, s, childless, uncle, edward, duke, of, york, was, killed, at, agincourt, richard, was, allowed, to, inherit, the, title, of, duke, of, york, in, 1426, in, 1432, he, acquired, the, earldoms, of, march, and, ulster, on, the, death, of, his, maternal, uncle, edmund, mortimer, earl, of, march, who, had, died, campaigning, with, henry, v, in, france, and, the, earldom, of, cambridge, which, had, belonged, to, his, father, being, descended, from, edward, iii, in, both, the, maternal, and, the, paternal, line, gave, richard, a, significant, claim, to, the, throne, if, the, lancastrian, line, should, fail, and, by, cognatic, primogeniture, arguably, a, superior, claim, he, emphasised, the, point, by, being, the, first, to, assume, the, plantagenet, surname, in, 1448, having, inherited, the, march, and, ulster, titles, he, became, the, wealthiest, and, most, powerful, noble, in, england, second, only, to, the, king, himself, richard, married, cecily, neville, a, granddaughter, of, john, of, gaunt, and, had, thirteen, or, possibly, fifteen, children, when, henry, vi, had, a, mental, breakdown, richard, was, named, regent, but, the, birth, of, a, male, heir, resolved, the, question, of, succession, when, henry, s, sanity, returned, the, court, party, reasserted, its, authority, but, richard, of, york, and, the, nevilles, defeated, them, at, a, skirmish, called, the, first, battle, of, st, albans, the, ruling, class, was, deeply, shocked, and, reconciliation, was, attempted, york, and, the, nevilles, fled, abroad, but, the, nevilles, returned, to, win, the, battle, of, northampton, where, they, captured, henry, when, richard, of, york, joined, them, he, surprised, parliament, by, claiming, the, throne, and, forcing, through, the, act, of, accord, which, stated, that, henry, would, remain, as, king, for, his, lifetime, but, would, be, succeeded, by, york, margaret, found, this, disregard, for, her, son, s, claims, unacceptable, and, so, the, conflict, continued, york, was, killed, at, the, battle, of, wakefield, and, his, head, set, on, display, at, micklegate, bar, along, with, those, of, edmund, earl, of, rutland, and, richard, neville, earl, of, salisbury, who, had, been, captured, and, beheaded, the, scottish, queen, mary, of, guelders, provided, margaret, with, support, but, london, welcomed, york, s, son, edward, earl, of, march, and, parliament, confirmed, that, edward, should, be, made, king, he, was, crowned, after, consolidating, his, position, with, victory, at, the, battle, of, towton, edward, s,

neville, brothers, the, subsequent, battle, of, tewkesbury, brought, the, demise, of, the, last, of, the, male, line, of, the, beauforts, the, battlefield, casualty, of, edward, of, westminster,

throne, through, his, mother, margaret, beaufort, tudor, assumed, the, throne, as, henry, vii, founding, the, tudor, dynasty, and, bringing, the, plantagenet, line, of, kings, to, an, end, when, henry, vii, of, england, seized, the, throne, there, were, eighteen, plantagenet, descendants, who, might, today, be, thought, to, have, a, stronger, hereditary, claim, and, by, 1510, this, number, had, been, increased, further, by, the, birth, of, sixteen, yorkist, children, henry, mitigated, this, situation, with, his, marriage, to, elizabeth, of, york, she, was, the, eldest, daughter, of, edward, iv, and, all, their, children, were, his, cognatic, heirs, indeed, polydore, vergil, noted, henry, viii, s, pronounced, resemblance, to, his, grandfather, edward, for, just, as, edward, was, the, most, warmly, thought, of, by, the, english, people, amongst, all, english, kings, so, this, successor, of, his, henry, was, very, much, like, him, in, general, appearance, in, greatness, of, mind, and, generosity, and, for, that, reason, was, the, most, acclaimed, and, approved, of, all, this, did, not, deter, margaret, of, york, duchess, of, burgundy, edward, s, sister, and, elizabeth, s, aunt, and, members, of, the, de, la, pole, family, children, of, edward, s, sister, and, john, de, la, pole, 2nd, duke, of, suffolk, from, frequent, attempts, to, destabilise, henry, s, regime, henry, imprisoned, margaret, s, nephew, edward, earl, of, warwick, the, son, of, her, brother, george, in, the, tower, of, london, but, in, 1487, margaret, financed, a, rebellion, led, by, lambert, simnel, whose, true, identity, remains, uncertain, though, he, himself, presented, himself, as, edward, vi, john, de, la, pole, 1st, earl, of, lincoln, joined, the, revolt, probably, anticipating, that, it, would, further, his, own, ambitions, to, the, throne, but, he, was, killed, in, the, suppression, of, the, uprising, at, the, battle, of, stoke, field, in, 1487, warwick, was, implicated, by, two, further, failed, invasions, supported, by, margaret, by, the, so, called, perkin, warbeck, claiming, to, be, edward, iv, s, son, richard, of, shrewsbury, and, supposedly, warbeck, s, later, planned, escape, for, them, both, warwick, was, executed, in, 1499, with, his, death, the, house, of, plantagenet, went, extinct, in, the, legitimate, male, line, edward, s, execution, may, simply, have, been, a, precondition, for, the, marriage, of, arthur, prince, of, wales, to, katherine, of, aragon, in, 1501, john, de, la, pole, s, attainder, meant, that, his, brother, edmund, inherited, their, father, s, titles, but, much, of, the, wealth, of, the, duchy, of, suffolk, was, forfeit, edmund, did, not, possess, sufficient, finances, to, maintain, his, status, as, a, duke, so, as, a, compromise, he, accepted, the, title, of, earl, of, suffolk, financial, difficulties, led, to, frequent, legal, conflicts, and, edmund, s, indictment, for, murder, in, 1501, he, fled, with, his, brother, richard, while, their, remaining, brother, william, was, imprisoned, in, the, tower, where, he, would, remain, until, his, death, 37, years, later, as, part, of, a, general, suppression, of, edmund, s, associates, philip, the, fair, had, been, holding, edmund, and, in, 1506, he, returned, him, to, henry, edmund, was, imprisoned, in, the, tower, in, 1513, he, was, executed, after, richard, de, la, pole, whom, louis, xii, of, france, had, recognised, as, king, of, england, the, previous, year, claimed, the, kingship, in, his, own, right, richard, known, as, the, white, rose, plotted, an, invasion, of, england, for, years, but, was, killed, in, 1525, at, the, battle, of, pavia, while, fighting, as, the, captain, of, the, french, landsknechts, during, fran, ois, i, of, france, s, invasion, of, italy, warwick, s, sister, and, therefore, edward, iv, s, niece, margaret, pole, countess, of, salisbury, was, executed, by, henry, viii, in, 1541, by, then, the, cause, was, more, religious, and, political, rather, than, dynastic, the, attainder, of, her, father, clarence, was, a, legal, bar, to, any, claims, to, the, throne, by, his, children, additionally, her, marriage, arranged, by, henry, vii, to, sir, richard, pole, his, half, cousin, and, trusted, supporter, was, not, auspicious, nevertheless, it, did, allow, the, couple, to, be, closely, involved, in, court, affairs, margaret, s, fortunes, improved, under, henry, viii, and, in, february, 1512, she, was, restored, to, the, earldom, of, salisbury, and, all, the, warwicks, lands, this, made, her, the, first, and, apart, from, anne, boleyn, the, only, woman, in, 16th, century, england, to, hold, a, peerage, title, in, her, own, right, her, daughter, ursula, married, the, son, of, edward, stafford, 3rd, duke, of, buckingham, buckingham, s, fall, after, arguments, with, the, king, over, property, and, margaret, s, open, support, for, catherine, of, aragon, and, princess, mary, began, the, poles, estrangement, from, the, king, hope, of, reconciliation, was, dashed, by, de, unitate, the, letter, that, margaret, s, son, reginald, pole, wrote, to, henry, viii, in, which, reginald, declared, his, opposition, to, the, royal, supremacy, in, 1538, evidence, came, to, light, that, pole, family, members, in, england, had, been, in, communication, with, reginald, margaret, s, sons, geoffrey, and, henry, were, arrested, for, treason, along, with, several, friends, and, associates, including, henry, s, wife, and, brother, in, law, edward, neville, among, those, arrested, was, the, king, s, cousin, henry, courtenay, 1st, marquess, of, exeter, his, wife, and, 11, year, old, son, courteney, s, wife, was, released, two, years, later, but, their, son, spent, 15, years, in, the, tower, until, queen, mary, released, him, except, for, the, surviving, geoffrey, pole, all, the, others, implicated, were, beheaded, margaret, was, attainted, the, possibility, of, an, invasion, involving, reginald, via, her, south, coast, estates, and, her, embittered, relationship, with, henry, viii, precluded, any, chance, of, pardon, however, the, decision, to, execute, her, seems, a, spontaneous, rather, than, a, premeditated, act, according, to, the, calendar, of, state, papers, her, execution, was, botched, at, the, hands, of, a, wretched, and, blundering, youth, who, literally, hacked, her, head, and, shoulders, to, pieces, in, the, most, pitiful, manner, in, 1886, she, was, beatified, by, pope, leo, xiii, on, the, grounds, she, had, laid, down, her, life, for, the, holy, see, and, for, the, truth, of, the, orthodox, faith, edward, stafford, 3rd, duke, of, buckingham, combined, multiple, lines, of, plantagenet, descent, from, edward, iii, by, his, son, thomas, of, woodstock, from, edward, iii, via, two, of, his, beaufort, grandchildren, and, from, edward, i, from, joan, of, kent, and, the, holland, family, his, father, failed, in, his, rebellion, against, richard, iii, in, 1483, but, was, restored, to, his, inheritance, on, the, reversal, of, his, father, s, attainder, late, in, 1485, his, mother, married, henry, vii, s, uncle, jasper, tudor, and, his, wardship, was, entrusted, to, the, king, s, mother, lady, margaret, beaufort, in, 1502, during, henry, vii, s, illness, there, was, debate, as, to, whether, buckingham, or, edmund, de, la, pole, should, act, as, regent, for, henry, viii, there, is, no, evidence, of, continuous, hostility, between, buckingham, and, henry, viii, but, there, is, little, doubt, of, the, duke, s, dislike, of, thomas, wolsey, whom, he, believed, to, be, plotting, to, ruin, the, old, nobility, therefore, henry, viii, instructed, wolsey, to, watch, buckingham, his, brother, henry, stafford, 1st, earl, of, wiltshire, and, three, other, peers, neither, henry, viii, nor, his, father, planned, to, destroy, buckingham, because, of, his, lineage, and, henry, viii, even, allowed, buckingham, s, son, and, heir, henry, stafford, 1st, baron, stafford, to, marry, ursula, pole, giving, the, staffords, a, further, line, of, royal, blood, descent, buckingham, himself, was, arrested, in, april, 1521, he, was, found, guilty, on, 16, may, and, executed, the, next, day, evidence, was, provided, that, the, duke, had, been, listening, to, prophecies, that, he, would, be, king, and, that, the, tudor, family, lay, under, god, s, curse, for, the, execution, of, warwick, this, was, said, to, explain, henry, viii, s, failure, to, produce, a, male, heir, much, of, this, evidence, consisted, of, ill, judged, comments, speculation, and, bad, temper, but, it, underlined, the, threat, presented, by, buckingham, s, descent, as, late, as, 1600, with, the, tudor, succession, in, doubt, older, plantagenet, lines, remained, as, possible, claimants, to, a, disputed, throne, and, religious, and, dynastic, factors, gave, rise, to, complications, thomas, wilson, wrote, in, his, report, the, state, of, england, anno, domini, 1600, that, there, were, 12, competitors, for, the, succession, at, the, time, of, writing, about, 1601, wilson, had, been, working, on, intelligence, matters, for, lord, buckhurst, and, sir, robert, cecil, the, alleged, competitors, included, five, descendants, of, henry, vii, and, elizabeth, including, the, eventual, successor, james, i, of, england, but, also, seven, from, older, plantagenet, lines, ranulph, crewe, chief, justice, of, the, king, s, bench, argued, that, by, 1626, the, house, of, plantagenet, could, not, be, considered, to, remain, in, existence, in, a, speech, during, the, oxford, peerage, case, which, was, to, rule, on, who, should, inherit, the, earldom, of, oxford, it, was, referred, by, charles, i, of, england, to, the, house, of, lords, who, called, for, judicial, assistance, crewe, said, i, have, labored, to, make, a, covenant, with, myself, that, affection, may, not, press, upon, judgement, for, i, suppose, there, is, no, man, that, hath, any, apprehension, of, gentry, or, nobleness, but, his, affection, stands, to, the, continuance, of, a, house, so, illustrious, and, would, take, hold, of, a, twig, or, twine, thread, to, support, it, and, yet, time, hath, his, revolutions, there, must, be, a, period, and, an, end, to, all, temporal, things, finis, rerum, an, end, of, names, and, dignities, and, whatsoever, is, terrene, and, why, not, of, de,

mortality, yet, let, the, name, of, de, vere, stand, so, long, as, it, pleaseth, god, male, male, line, legitimate, non, morganatic, members, of, the, house, who, either, lived, to, adulthood, or,
