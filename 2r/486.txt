the, new, deal, was, a, series, of, programs, public, work, projects, financial, reforms, and, regulations, enacted, by, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, in, the, united, states, between, 1933, and, 1938, to, rescue, the, u, s, from, the, great, depression, it, was, widely, believed, that, the, depression, was, caused, by, the, inherent, market, instability, and, that, government, intervention, was, necessary, to, rationalize, and, stabilize, the, economy, major, federal, programs, and, agencies, including, the, civilian, conservation, corps, ccc, the, works, progress, administration, wpa, the, civil, works, administration, cwa, the, farm, security, administration, fsa, the, national, industrial, recovery, act, of, 1933, nira, and, the, social, security, administration, ssa, provided, support, for, farmers, the, unemployed, youth, and, the, elderly, the, new, deal, included, new, constraints, and, safeguards, on, the, banking, industry, and, efforts, to, re, inflate, the, economy, after, prices, had, fallen, sharply, new, deal, programs, included, both, laws, passed, by, congress, as, well, as, presidential, executive, orders, during, the, first, term, of, the, presidency, of, franklin, d, roosevelt, the, programs, focused, on, what, historians, refer, to, as, the, 3, r, s, relief, for, the, unemployed, and, for, the, poor, recovery, of, the, economy, back, to, normal, levels, and, reform, of, the, financial, system, to, prevent, a, repeat, depression, the, new, deal, produced, a, political, realignment, making, the, democratic, party, the, majority, as, well, as, the, party, that, held, the, white, house, for, seven, out, of, the, nine, presidential, terms, from, 1933, to, 1969, with, its, base, in, progressive, ideas, the, south, big, city, machines, and, the, newly, empowered, labour, unions, and, various, ethnic, groups, the, republicans, were, split, with, progressive, republicans, in, support, but, conservatives, opposing, the, entire, new, deal, as, hostile, to, business, and, economic, growth, the, realignment, crystallized, into, the, new, deal, coalition, that, dominated, presidential, elections, into, the, 1960s, and, the, opposing, conservative, coalition, largely, controlled, congress, in, domestic, affairs, from, 1937, to, 1964, the, first, new, deal, 1933, 1934, dealt, with, the, pressing, banking, crisis, through, the, emergency, banking, act, and, the, 1933, banking, act, the, federal, emergency, relief, administration, fera, provided, us, 500, million, equivalent, to, 11, 8, billion, in, 2023, for, relief, operations, by, states, and, cities, and, the, short, lived, cwa, gave, locals, money, to, operate, make, work, projects, from, 1933, to, 1934, the, securities, act, of, 1933, was, enacted, to, prevent, a, repeated, stock, market, crash, the, controversial, work, of, the, national, recovery, administration, nra, was, also, part, of, the, first, new, deal, the, second, new, deal, in, 1935, 1936, included, the, national, labor, relations, act, to, protect, labor, organizing, the, works, progress, administration, wpa, relief, program, which, made, the, federal, government, the, largest, employer, in, the, nation, the, social, security, act, and, new, programs, to, aid, tenant, farmers, and, migrant, workers, the, final, major, items, of, new, deal, legislation, were, the, creation, of, the, united, states, housing, authority, and, the, fsa, which, both, occurred, in, 1937, and, the, fair, labor, standards, act, of, 1938, which, set, maximum, hours, and, minimum, wages, for, most, categories, of, workers, the, fsa, was, also, one, of, the, oversight, authorities, of, the, puerto, rico, reconstruction, administration, which, administered, relief, efforts, to, puerto, rican, citizens, affected, by, the, great, depression, roosevelt, had, built, a, new, deal, coalition, but, the, economic, downturn, of, 1937, 1938, and, the, bitter, split, between, the, american, federation, of, labor, afl, and, congress, of, industrial, organizations, cio, labor, unions, led, to, major, republican, gains, in, congress, in, 1938, conservative, republicans, and, democrats, in, congress, joined, the, informal, conservative, coalition, by, 1942, 1943, they, shut, down, relief, programs, such, as, the, wpa, and, the, ccc, and, blocked, major, progressive, proposals, noting, the, composition, of, the, new, congress, one, study, argued, the, congress, that, assembled, in, january, 1939, was, quite, unlike, any, with, which, roosevelt, had, to, contend, before, since, all, democratic, losses, took, place, in, the, north, and, the, west, and, particularly, in, states, like, ohio, and, pennsylvania, southerners, held, a, much, stronger, position, the, house, contained, 169, non, southern, democrats, 93, southern, democrats, 169, republicans, and, 4, third, party, representatives, for, the, first, time, roosevelt, could, not, form, a, majority, without, the, help, of, some, southerners, or, republicans, in, addition, the, president, had, to, contend, with, several, senators, who, having, successfully, resisted, the, purge, no, longer, owed, him, anything, most, observers, agreed, therefore, that, the, president, could, at, best, hope, to, consolidate, but, certainly, not, to, extend, the, new, deal, james, farley, thought, that, roosevelt, s, wisest, course, would, be, to, clean, up, odds, and, ends, tighten, up, and, improve, things, already, has, but, not, try, start, anything, new, in, any, event, farley, predicted, that, congress, would, discard, much, of, roosevelt, s, program, as, noted, by, another, study, the, 1938, elections, proved, a, decisive, point, in, the, consolidation, of, the, conservative, coalition, in, congress, the, liberal, bloc, in, the, house, had, been, halved, and, conservative, democrats, had, escaped, relatively, untouched, in, the, house, elected, in, 1938, there, were, at, least, 30, anti, new, deal, democrats, and, another, 50, who, were, not, at, all, enthusiastic, in, addition, the, new, senate, was, split, about, evenly, between, pro, and, anti, new, deal, factions, the, fair, labor, standards, act, of, 1938, was, the, last, major, new, deal, legislation, that, roosevelt, succeeded, in, enacting, into, law, before, the, conservative, coalition, won, control, of, congress, though, he, could, usually, use, the, veto, to, restrain, congress, congress, could, block, any, roosevelt, legislation, it, disliked, nonetheless, roosevelt, turned, his, attention, to, the, war, effort, and, won, reelection, in, 1940, 1944, furthermore, the, supreme, court, declared, the, nra, and, the, first, version, of, the, agricultural, adjustment, act, aaa, unconstitutional, but, the, aaa, was, rewritten, and, then, upheld, republican, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, 1953, 1961, left, the, new, deal, largely, intact, even, expanding, it, in, some, areas, in, the, 1960s, lyndon, b, johnson, s, great, society, used, the, new, deal, as, inspiration, for, a, dramatic, expansion, of, progressive, programs, which, republican, richard, nixon, generally, retained, however, after, 1974, the, call, for, deregulation, of, the, economy, gained, bipartisan, support, the, new, deal, regulation, of, banking, glass, steagall, act, lasted, until, it, was, suspended, in, the, 1990s, several, organizations, created, by, new, deal, programs, remain, active, and, those, operating, under, the, original, names, include, the, federal, deposit, insurance, corporation, fdic, the, federal, crop, insurance, corporation, fcic, the, federal, housing, administration, fha, and, the, tennessee, valley, authority, tva, the, largest, programs, still, in, existence, are, the, social, security, system, and, the, securities, and, exchange, commission, sec, from, 1929, to, 1933, manufacturing, output, decreased, by, one, third, which, economist, milton, friedman, later, called, the, great, contraction, prices, fell, by, 20, causing, deflation, that, made, repaying, debts, much, harder, unemployment, in, the, united, states, increased, from, 4, to, 25, additionally, one, third, of, all, employed, persons, were, downgraded, to, working, part, time, on, much, smaller, paychecks, in, the, aggregate, almost, 50, of, the, nation, s, human, work, power, was, going, unused, before, the, new, deal, usa, bank, deposits, were, not, guaranteed, by, government, when, thousands, of, banks, closed, depositors, temporarily, lost, access, to, their, money, most, of, the, funds, were, eventually, restored, but, there, was, gloom, and, panic, the, united, states, had, no, national, safety, net, no, public, unemployment, insurance, and, no, social, security, relief, for, the, poor, was, the, responsibility, of, families, private, charity, and, local, governments, but, as, conditions, worsened, year, by, year, demand, skyrocketed, and, their, combined, resources, increasingly, fell, far, short, of, demand, the, depression, had, psychologically, devastated, the, nation, as, roosevelt, took, the, oath, of, office, at, noon, on, march, 4, 1933, all, state, governors, had, authorized, bank, holidays, or, restricted, withdrawals, many, americans, had, little, or, no, access, to, their, bank, accounts, farm, income, had, fallen, by, over, 50, since, 1929, between, 1930, and, 1933, an, estimated, 844, 000, non, farm, mortgages, were, foreclosed, on, out, of, a, total, of, five, million, political, and, business, leaders, feared, revolution, and, anarchy, joseph, p, kennedy, sr, who, remained, wealthy, during, the, depression, recalled, that, in, those, days, i, felt, and, said, i, would, be, willing, to, part, with, half, of, what, i, had, if, i, could, be, sure, of, keeping, under, law, and, order, the, other, half, throughout, the, nation, men, and, women, forgotten, in, the, political, philosophy, of, the, government, look, to, us, here, for, guidance, and, for, more, equitable, opportunity, to, share, in, the, distribution, of, national, wealth, i, pledge, myself, to, a, new, deal, for, the, american, people, this, is, more, than, a, political, campaign, it, is, a, call, to, arms, franklin, d, roosevelt, 1932, the, phrase, new, deal, was, coined, by, an, adviser, to, roosevelt, stuart, chase, who, used, a, new, deal, as, the, title, for, an, article, published, in, the, progressive, magazine, the, new, republic, a, few, days, before, roosevelt, s, speech, speechwriter, rosenman, added, it, to, his, draft, of, fdr, s, presidential, nomination, acceptance, speech, at, the, last, minute, upon, accepting, the, 1932, democratic, nomination, for, president, roosevelt, promised, a, new, deal, for, the, american, people, in, campaign, speeches, roosevelt, committed, to, carrying, out, if, elected, several, elements, of, what, would, become, the, new, deal, such, as, unemployment, relief, and, public, works, programs, roosevelt, entered, office, with, clear, ideas, for, policies, to, address, the, great, depression, though, he, remained, open, to, experimentation, as, his, presidency, began, implementing, these, among, roosevelt, s, more, famous, advisers, was, an, informal, brain, trust, a, group, that, tended, to, view, pragmatic, government, intervention, in, the, economy, positively, his, choice, for, secretary, of, labor, frances, perkins, greatly, influenced, his, initiatives, her, list, of, what, her, priorities, would, be, if, she, took, the, job, illustrates, a, forty, hour, workweek, a, minimum, wage, worker, s, compensation, unemployment, compensation, a, federal, law, banning, child, labor, direct, federal, aid, for, unemployment, relief, social, security, a, revitalized, public, employment, service, and, health, insurance, the, new, deal, policies, drew, from, many, different, ideas, proposed, earlier, in, the, 20th, century, assistant, attorney, general, thurman, arnold, led, efforts, that, hearkened, back, to, an, anti, monopoly, tradition, rooted, in, american, politics, by, figures, such, as, andrew, jackson, and, thomas, jefferson, supreme, court, justice, louis, brandeis, an, influential, adviser, to, many, new, dealers, argued, that, bigness, referring, presumably, to, corporations, was, a, negative, economic, force, producing, waste, and, inefficiency, however, the, anti, monopoly, group, never, had, a, major, impact, on, new, deal, policy, other, leaders, such, as, hugh, s, johnson, of, the, nra, took, ideas, from, the, woodrow, wilson, administration, advocating, techniques, used, to, mobilize, the, economy, for, world, war, i, they, brought, ideas, and, experience, from, the, government, controls, and, spending, of, 1917, 1918, other, new, deal, planners, revived, experiments, suggested, in, the, 1920s, such, as, the, tva, the, first, new, deal, 1933, 1934, encompassed, the, proposals, offered, by, a, wide, spectrum, of, groups, not, included, was, the, socialist, party, whose, influence, was, all, but, destroyed, this, first, phase, of, the, new, deal, was, also, characterized, by, fiscal, conservatism, see, economy, act, below, and, experimentation, with, several, different, sometimes, contradictory, cures, for, economic, ills, roosevelt, created, dozens, of, new, agencies, they, are, traditionally, and, typically, known, to, americans, by, their, alphabetical, initials, the, american, people, were, generally, extremely, dissatisfied, with, the, crumbling, economy, mass, unemployment, declining, wages, and, profits, and, especially, herbert, hoover, s, policies, such, as, the, smoot, hawley, tariff, act, and, the, revenue, act, of, 1932, roosevelt, entered, office, with, enormous, political, capital, americans, of, all, political, persuasions, were, demanding, immediate, action, and, roosevelt, responded, with, a, remarkable, series, of, new, programs, in, the, first, hundred, days, of, the, administration, in, which, he, met, with, congress, for, 100, days, during, those, 100, days, of, lawmaking, congress, granted, every, request, roosevelt, asked, and, passed, a, few, programs, such, as, the, federal, deposit, insurance, corporation, to, insure, bank, accounts, that, he, opposed, ever, since, presidents, have, been, judged, against, roosevelt, for, what, they, accomplished, in, their, first, 100, days, walter, lippmann, famously, noted, at, the, end, of, february, we, were, a, congeries, of, disorderly, panic, stricken, mobs, and, factions, in, the, hundred, days, from, march, to, june, we, became, again, an, organized, nation, confident, of, our, power, to, provide, for, our, own, security, and, to, control, our, own, destiny, the, economy, had, hit, bottom, in, march, 1933, and, then, started, to, expand, economic, indicators, show, the, economy, reached, its, lowest, point, in, the, first, days, of, march, then, began, a, steady, sharp, upward, recovery, thus, the, federal, reserve, index, of, industrial, production, sank, to, its, lowest, point, of, 52, 8, in, july, 1932, with, 1935, 1939, 100, and, was, practically, unchanged, at, 54, 3, in, march, 1933, however, by, july, 1933, it, reached, 85, 5, a, dramatic, rebound, of, 57, in, four, months, recovery, was, steady, and, strong, until, 1937, except, for, employment, the, economy, by, 1937, surpassed, the, levels, of, the, late, 1920s, the, recession, of, 1937, was, a, temporary, downturn, private, sector, employment, especially, in, manufacturing, recovered, to, the, level, of, the, 1920s, but, failed, to, advance, further, until, the, war, the, u, s, population, was, 124, 840, 471, in, 1932, and, 128, 824, 829, in, 1937, an, increase, of, 3, 984, 468, the, ratio, of, these, numbers, times, the, number, of, jobs, in, 1932, means, there, was, a, need, for, 938, 000, more, jobs, in, 1937, to, maintain, the, same, employment, level, the, economy, act, drafted, by, budget, director, lewis, williams, douglas, was, passed, on, march, 15, 1933, the, act, proposed, to, balance, the, regular, non, emergency, federal, budget, by, cutting, the, salaries, of, government, employees, and, cutting, pensions, to, veterans, by, fifteen, percent, it, saved, 500, million, per, year, and, reassured, deficit, hawks, such, as, douglas, that, the, new, president, was, fiscally, conservative, roosevelt, argued, there, were, two, budgets, the, regular, federal, budget, which, he, balanced, and, the, emergency, budget, which, was, needed, to, defeat, the, depression, it, was, imbalanced, on, a, temporary, basis, roosevelt, initially, favored, balancing, the, budget, but, soon, found, himself, running, spending, deficits, to, fund, his, numerous, programs, however, douglas, rejecting, the, distinction, between, a, regular, and, emergency, budget, resigned, in, 1934, and, became, an, outspoken, critic, of, the, new, deal, roosevelt, strenuously, opposed, the, bonus, bill, that, would, give, world, war, i, veterans, a, cash, bonus, congress, finally, passed, it, over, his, veto, in, 1936, and, the, treasury, distributed, 1, 5, billion, in, cash, as, bonus, welfare, benefits, to, 4, million, veterans, just, before, the, 1936, election, new, dealers, never, accepted, the, keynesian, argument, for, government, spending, as, a, vehicle, for, recovery, most, economists, of, the, era, along, with, henry, morgenthau, of, the, treasury, department, rejected, keynesian, solutions, and, favored, balanced, budgets, at, the, beginning, of, the, great, depression, the, economy, was, destabilized, by, bank, failures, followed, by, credit, crunches, the, initial, reasons, were, substantial, losses, in, investment, banking, followed, by, bank, runs, bank, runs, occur, when, a, large, number, of, customers, withdraw, their, deposits, because, they, believe, the, bank, might, become, insolvent, as, the, bank, run, progressed, it, generated, a, self, fulfilling, prophecy, as, more, people, withdrew, their, deposits, the, likelihood, of, default, increased, and, this, encouraged, further, withdrawals, milton, friedman, and, anna, schwartz, have, argued, that, the, drain, of, money, out, of, the, banking, system, caused, the, monetary, supply, to, shrink, forcing, the, economy, to, likewise, shrink, as, credit, and, economic, activity, diminished, price, deflation, followed, causing, further, economic, contraction, with, disastrous, impact, on, banks, between, 1929, and, 1933, 40, of, all, banks, 9, 490, out, of, 23, 697, banks, failed, much, of, the, great, depression, s, economic, damage, was, caused, directly, by, bank, runs, herbert, hoover, had, already, considered, a, bank, holiday, to, prevent, further, bank, runs, but, rejected, the, idea, because, he, was, afraid, to, incite, a, panic, however, roosevelt, gave, a, radio, address, held, in, the, atmosphere, of, a, fireside, chat, he, explained, to, the, public, in, simple, terms, the, causes, of, the, banking, crisis, what, the, government, would, do, and, how, the, population, could, help, he, closed, all, the, banks, in, the, country, and, kept, them, all, closed, until, new, legislation, could, be, passed, on, march, 9, 1933, roosevelt, sent, to, congress, the, emergency, banking, act, drafted, in, large, part, by, hoover, s, top, advisors, the, act, was, passed, and, signed, into, law, the, same, day, it, provided, for, a, system, of, reopening, sound, banks, under, treasury, supervision, with, federal, loans, available, if, needed, three, quarters, of, the, banks, in, the, federal, reserve, system, reopened, within, the, next, three, days, billions, of, dollars, in, hoarded, currency, and, gold, flowed, back, into, them, within, a, month, thus, stabilizing, the, banking, system, by, the, end, of, 1933, 4, 004, small, local, banks, were, permanently, closed, and, merged, into, larger, banks, their, deposits, totaled, 3, 6, billion, depositors, lost, 540, million, equivalent, to, 12, 710, 128, 535, in, 2023, and, eventually, received, on, average, 85, cents, on, the, dollar, of, their, deposits, the, glass, steagall, act, limited, commercial, bank, securities, activities, and, affiliations, between, commercial, banks, and, securities, firms, to, regulate, speculations, it, also, established, the, federal, deposit, insurance, corporation, fdic, which, insured, deposits, for, up, to, 2, 500, ending, the, risk, of, runs, on, banks, this, banking, reform, offered, unprecedented, stability, because, throughout, the, 1920s, more, than, five, hundred, banks, failed, per, year, and, then, it, was, less, than, ten, banks, per, year, after, 1933, under, the, gold, standard, the, united, states, kept, the, dollar, convertible, to, gold, the, federal, reserve, would, have, had, to, execute, an, expansionary, monetary, policy, to, fight, the, deflation, and, to, inject, liquidity, into, the, banking, system, to, prevent, it, from, crumbling, but, lower, interest, rates, would, have, led, to, a, gold, outflow, under, the, gold, standards, price, specie, flow, mechanism, countries, that, lost, gold, but, nevertheless, wanted, to, maintain, the, gold, standard, had, to, permit, their, money, supply, to, decrease, and, the, domestic, price, level, to, decline, deflation, as, long, as, the, federal, reserve, had, to, defend, the, gold, parity, of, the, dollar, it, had, to, sit, idle, while, the, banking, system, crumbled, in, march, and, april, in, a, series, of, laws, and, executive, orders, the, government, suspended, the, gold, standard, roosevelt, stopped, the, outflow, of, gold, by, forbidding, the, export, of, gold, except, under, license, from, the, treasury, anyone, holding, significant, amounts, of, gold, coinage, was, mandated, to, exchange, it, for, the, existing, fixed, price, of, u, s, dollars, the, treasury, no, longer, paid, out, gold, for, dollars, and, gold, would, no, longer, be, considered, valid, legal, tender, for, debts, in, private, and, public, contracts, the, dollar, was, allowed, to, float, freely, on, foreign, exchange, markets, with, no, guaranteed, price, in, gold, with, the, passage, of, the, gold, reserve, act, in, 1934, the, nominal, price, of, gold, was, changed, from, 20, 67, per, troy, ounce, to, 35, these, measures, enabled, the, federal, reserve, to, increase, the, amount, of, money, in, circulation, to, the, level, the, economy, needed, markets, immediately, responded, well, to, the, suspension, in, the, hope, that, the, decline, in, prices, would, finally, end, in, her, essay, what, ended, the, great, depression, 1992, christina, romer, argued, that, this, policy, raised, industrial, production, by, 25, until, 1937, and, by, 50, until, 1942, before, the, wall, street, crash, of, 1929, securities, were, unregulated, at, the, federal, level, even, firms, whose, securities, were, publicly, traded, published, no, regular, reports, or, even, worse, rather, misleading, reports, based, on, arbitrarily, selected, data, to, avoid, another, crash, the, securities, act, of, 1933, was, passed, it, required, the, disclosure, of, the, balance, sheet, profit, and, loss, statement, and, the, names, and, compensations, of, corporate, officers, for, firms, whose, securities, were, traded, additionally, the, reports, had, to, be, verified, by, independent, auditors, in, 1934, the, u, s, securities, and, exchange, commission, was, established, to, regulate, the, stock, market, and, prevent, corporate, abuses, relating, to, corporate, reporting, and, the, sale, of, securities, in, a, measure, that, garnered, substantial, popular, support, for, his, new, deal, roosevelt, moved, to, put, to, rest, one, of, the, most, divisive, cultural, issues, of, the, 1920s, he, signed, the, bill, to, legalize, the, manufacture, and, sale, of, alcohol, an, interim, measure, pending, the, repeal, of, prohibition, for, which, a, constitutional, amendment, of, repeal, the, 21st, was, already, in, process, the, repeal, amendment, was, ratified, later, in, 1933, states, and, cities, gained, additional, new, revenue, and, roosevelt, secured, his, popularity, especially, in, the, cities, and, ethnic, areas, by, legalizing, alcohol, relief, was, the, immediate, effort, to, help, the, one, third, of, the, population, that, was, hardest, hit, by, the, depression, relief, was, also, aimed, at, providing, temporary, help, to, suffering, and, unemployed, americans, local, and, state, budgets, were, sharply, reduced, because, of, falling, tax, revenue, but, new, deal, relief, programs, were, used, not, just, to, hire, the, unemployed, but, also, to, build, needed, schools, municipal, buildings, waterworks, sewers, streets, and, parks, according, to, local, specifications, while, the, regular, army, and, navy, budgets, were, reduced, roosevelt, juggled, relief, funds, to, provide, for, their, claimed, needs, all, of, the, ccc, camps, were, directed, by, army, officers, whose, salaries, came, from, the, relief, budget, the, pwa, built, numerous, warships, including, two, aircraft, carriers, the, money, came, from, the, pwa, agency, pwa, also, built, warplanes, and, the, wpa, built, military, bases, and, airfields, to, prime, the, pump, and, cut, unemployment, the, nira, created, the, public, works, administration, pwa, a, major, program, of, public, works, which, organized, and, provided, funds, for, the, building, of, useful, works, such, as, government, buildings, airports, hospitals, schools, roads, bridges, and, dams, from, 1933, to, 1935, pwa, spent, 3, 3, billion, with, private, companies, to, build, 34, 599, projects, many, of, them, quite, large, the, nira, also, contained, a, provision, for, the, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or, repair, under, public, regulation, or, control, of, low, cost, housing, and, slum, clearance, projects, many, unemployed, people, were, put, to, work, under, roosevelt, on, a, variety, of, government, financed, public, works, projects, including, the, construction, of, bridges, airports, dams, post, offices, hospitals, and, hundreds, of, thousands, of, miles, of, road, through, reforestation, and, flood, control, they, reclaimed, millions, of, hectares, of, soil, from, erosion, and, devastation, as, noted, by, one, authority, roosevelt, s, new, deal, was, literally, stamped, on, the, american, landscape, the, rural, u, s, was, a, high, priority, for, roosevelt, and, his, energetic, secretary, of, agriculture, henry, a, wallace, roosevelt, believed, that, full, economic, recovery, depended, upon, the, recovery, of, agriculture, and, raising, farm, prices, was, a, major, tool, even, though, it, meant, higher, food, prices, for, the, poor, living, in, cities, many, rural, people, lived, in, severe, poverty, especially, in, the, south, major, programs, addressed, to, their, needs, included, the, resettlement, administration, ra, the, rural, electrification, administration, rea, rural, welfare, projects, sponsored, by, the, wpa, national, youth, administration, nya, forest, service, and, civilian, conservation, corps, ccc, including, school, lunches, building, new, schools, opening, roads, in, remote, areas, reforestation, and, purchase, of, marginal, lands, to, enlarge, national, forests, in, 1933, the, roosevelt, administration, launched, the, tennessee, valley, authority, a, project, involving, dam, construction, planning, on, an, unprecedented, scale, to, curb, flooding, generate, electricity, and, modernize, poor, farms, in, the, tennessee, valley, region, of, the, southern, united, states, under, the, farmers, relief, act, of, 1933, the, government, paid, compensation, to, farmers, who, reduced, output, thereby, raising, prices, because, of, this, legislation, the, average, income, of, farmers, almost, doubled, by, 1937, in, the, 1920s, farm, production, had, increased, dramatically, thanks, to, mechanization, more, potent, insecticides, and, increased, use, of, fertilizer, due, to, an, overproduction, of, agricultural, products, farmers, faced, severe, and, chronic, agricultural, depression, throughout, the, 1920s, the, great, depression, even, worsened, the, agricultural, crises, and, at, the, beginning, of, 1933, agricultural, markets, nearly, faced, collapse, farm, prices, were, so, low, that, in, montana, wheat, was, rotting, in, the, fields, because, it, could, not, be, profitably, harvested, in, oregon, sheep, were, slaughtered, and, left, to, rot, because, meat, prices, were, not, sufficient, to, warrant, transportation, to, markets, roosevelt, was, keenly, interested, in, farm, issues, and, believed, that, true, prosperity, would, not, return, until, farming, was, prosperous, many, different, programs, were, directed, at, farmers, the, first, 100, days, produced, the, farm, security, act, to, raise, farm, incomes, by, raising, the, prices, farmers, received, which, was, achieved, by, reducing, total, farm, output, the, agricultural, adjustment, act, created, the, agricultural, adjustment, administration, aaa, in, may, 1933, the, act, reflected, the, demands, of, leaders, of, major, farm, organizations, especially, the, farm, bureau, and, reflected, debates, among, roosevelt, s, farm, advisers, such, as, secretary, of, agriculture, henry, a, wallace, m, l, wilson, rexford, tugwell, and, george, peek, the, aaa, aimed, to, raise, prices, for, commodities, through, artificial, scarcity, the, aaa, used, a, system, of, domestic, allotments, setting, total, output, of, corn, cotton, dairy, products, hogs, rice, tobacco, and, wheat, the, farmers, themselves, had, a, voice, in, the, process, of, using, the, government, to, benefit, their, incomes, the, aaa, paid, land, owners, subsidies, for, leaving, some, of, their, land, idle, with, funds, provided, by, a, new, tax, on, food, processing, to, force, up, farm, prices, to, the, point, of, parity, 10, million, acres, 40, 000, km, 2, of, growing, cotton, was, plowed, up, bountiful, crops, were, left, to, rot, and, six, million, piglets, were, killed, and, discarded, the, idea, was, to, give, farmers, a, fair, exchange, value, for, their, products, in, relation, to, the, general, economy, parity, level, farm, incomes, and, the, income, for, the, general, population, recovered, fast, since, the, beginning, of, 1933, food, prices, remained, still, well, below, the, 1929, peak, the, aaa, established, an, important, and, long, lasting, federal, role, in, the, planning, of, the, entire, agricultural, sector, of, the, economy, and, was, the, first, program, on, such, a, scale, for, the, troubled, agricultural, economy, the, original, aaa, targeted, landowners, and, therefore, did, not, provide, for, any, sharecroppers, or, tenants, or, farm, laborers, who, might, become, unemployed, a, gallup, poll, printed, in, the, washington, post, revealed, that, a, majority, of, the, american, public, opposed, the, aaa, in, 1936, the, supreme, court, declared, the, aaa, to, be, unconstitutional, stating, a, statutory, plan, to, regulate, and, control, agricultural, production, a, matter, beyond, the, powers, delegated, to, the, federal, government, the, aaa, was, replaced, by, a, similar, program, that, did, win, court, approval, instead, of, paying, farmers, for, letting, fields, lie, barren, this, program, subsidized, them, for, planting, soil, enriching, crops, such, as, alfalfa, that, would, not, be, sold, on, the, market, federal, regulation, of, agricultural, production, has, been, modified, many, times, since, then, but, together, with, large, subsidies, is, still, in, effect, a, number, of, other, measures, affecting, rural, areas, were, introduced, under, roosevelt, the, farm, credit, act, of, 1933, authorized, farmers, to, organize, a, nationwide, system, of, local, credit, cooperatives, production, credit, associations, to, make, operating, credit, readily, accessible, to, farmers, throughout, the, country, the, farm, mortgage, foreclosure, act, of, 1934, provided, for, debt, reduction, and, the, redemption, of, foreclosed, farms, and, the, homestead, settler, s, act, of, 1934, liberalized, homestead, residence, requirements, the, farm, research, act, of, 1935, included, various, provisions, such, as, the, development, of, cooperative, agricultural, extension, and, the, commodity, exchange, act, of, 1936, enabled, the, commodity, credit, corporation, to, better, serve, the, needs, of, farmers, in, orderly, marketing, and, provided, credit, and, facilities, for, carrying, surpluses, from, season, to, season, the, farmers, mortgage, amendatory, act, of, 1936, authorized, the, reconstruction, finance, corporation, to, make, loans, to, drainage, levee, and, irrigation, districts, while, under, the, soil, conservation, and, domestic, allotment, act, of, 1936, payments, to, farmers, to, encourage, conservation, were, authorized, in, 1937, the, water, facilities, act, was, enacted, to, provide, loans, for, individuals, and, association, farm, water, systems, in, 17, western, states, where, drought, and, water, shortage, were, familiar, hardships, the, bankhead, jones, farm, tenant, act, of, 1937, was, the, last, major, new, deal, legislation, that, concerned, farming, it, created, the, farm, security, administration, fsa, which, replaced, the, resettlement, administration, the, food, stamp, plan, a, major, new, welfare, program, for, urban, poor, was, established, in, 1939, to, provide, stamps, to, poor, people, who, could, use, them, to, purchase, food, at, retail, outlets, the, program, ended, during, wartime, prosperity, in, 1943, but, was, restored, in, 1961, it, survived, into, the, 21st, century, with, little, controversy, because, it, was, seen, to, benefit, the, urban, poor, food, producers, grocers, wholesalers, and, farmers, so, it, gained, support, from, both, progressive, and, conservative, congressmen, in, 2013, tea, party, activists, in, the, house, nonetheless, tried, to, end, the, program, now, known, as, the, supplemental, nutrition, assistance, program, while, the, senate, fought, to, preserve, it, recovery, was, the, effort, in, numerous, programs, to, restore, the, economy, to, normal, levels, by, most, economic, indicators, this, was, achieved, by, 1937, except, for, unemployment, which, remained, stubbornly, high, until, world, war, ii, began, recovery, was, designed, to, help, the, economy, bounce, back, from, depression, economic, historians, led, by, price, fishback, have, examined, the, impact, of, new, deal, spending, on, improving, health, conditions, in, the, 114, largest, cities, 1929, 1937, they, estimated, that, every, additional, 153, 000, in, relief, spending, in, 1935, dollars, or, 1, 95, million, in, the, year, 2000, dollars, was, associated, with, a, reduction, of, one, infant, death, one, suicide, and, 2, 4, deaths, from, infectious, diseases, from, 1929, to, 1933, the, industrial, economy, suffered, from, a, vicious, cycle, of, deflation, since, 1931, the, u, s, chamber, of, commerce, the, voice, of, the, nation, s, organized, business, promoted, an, anti, deflationary, scheme, that, would, permit, trade, associations, to, cooperate, in, government, instigated, cartels, to, stabilize, prices, within, their, industries, though, existing, antitrust, laws, clearly, forbade, such, practices, the, organized, business, were, entertained, by, the, roosevelt, administration, roosevelt, s, advisors, believed, that, excessive, competition, and, technical, progress, had, led, to, overproduction, and, lowered, wages, and, prices, which, they, believed, lowered, demand, and, employment, deflation, he, argued, that, government, economic, planning, was, necessary, to, remedy, this, new, deal, economists, argued, that, cut, throat, competition, had, hurt, many, businesses, and, that, with, prices, having, fallen, 20, and, more, deflation, exacerbated, the, burden, of, debt, and, would, delay, recovery, they, rejected, a, strong, move, in, congress, to, limit, the, workweek, to, 30, hours, instead, their, remedy, designed, in, cooperation, with, big, business, was, the, national, industrial, recovery, act, nira, it, included, stimulus, funds, for, the, wpa, to, spend, and, sought, to, raise, prices, give, more, bargaining, power, for, unions, so, the, workers, could, purchase, more, and, reduce, harmful, competition, at, the, center, of, the, nira, was, the, national, recovery, administration, nra, headed, by, former, general, hugh, s, johnson, who, had, been, a, senior, economic, official, in, world, war, i, johnson, called, on, every, business, establishment, in, the, nation, to, accept, a, stopgap, blanket, code, a, minimum, wage, of, between, 20, and, 45, cents, per, hour, a, maximum, workweek, of, 35, 45, hours, and, the, abolition, of, child, labor, johnson, and, roosevelt, contended, that, the, blanket, code, would, raise, consumer, purchasing, power, and, increase, employment, to, mobilize, political, support, for, the, nra, johnson, launched, the, nra, blue, eagle, publicity, campaign, to, boost, what, he, called, industrial, self, government, the, nra, brought, together, leaders, in, each, industry, to, design, specific, sets, of, codes, for, that, industry, the, most, important, provisions, were, anti, deflationary, floors, below, which, no, company, would, lower, prices, or, wages, and, agreements, on, maintaining, employment, and, production, in, a, remarkably, short, time, the, nra, announced, agreements, from, almost, every, major, industry, in, the, nation, by, march, 1934, industrial, production, was, 45, higher, than, in, march, 1933, nra, administrator, hugh, johnson, was, showing, signs, of, a, mental, breakdown, due, to, the, extreme, pressure, and, workload, of, running, the, national, recovery, administration, johnson, lost, power, in, september, 1934, but, kept, his, title, roosevelt, replaced, his, position, with, a, new, national, industrial, recovery, board, of, which, donald, richberg, was, named, executive, director, on, may, 27, 1935, the, nra, was, found, to, be, unconstitutional, by, a, unanimous, decision, of, the, u, s, supreme, court, in, the, case, of, a, l, a, schechter, poultry, corp, v, united, states, after, the, end, of, the, nra, quotas, in, the, oil, industry, were, fixed, by, the, railroad, commission, of, texas, with, tom, connally, s, federal, hot, oil, act, of, 1935, which, guaranteed, that, illegal, hot, oil, would, not, be, sold, by, the, time, nra, ended, in, may, 1935, well, over, 2, million, employers, accepted, the, new, standards, laid, down, by, the, nra, which, had, introduced, a, minimum, wage, and, an, eight, hour, workday, together, with, abolishing, child, labor, these, standards, were, reintroduced, by, the, fair, labor, standards, act, of, 1938, historian, william, e, leuchtenburg, argued, in, 1963, the, nra, could, boast, some, considerable, achievements, it, gave, jobs, to, some, two, million, workers, it, helped, stop, a, renewal, of, the, deflationary, spiral, that, had, almost, wrecked, the, nation, it, did, something, to, improve, business, ethics, and, civilize, competition, it, established, a, national, pattern, of, maximum, hours, and, minimum, wages, and, it, all, but, wiped, out, child, labor, and, the, sweatshop, but, this, was, all, it, did, it, prevented, things, from, getting, worse, but, it, did, little, to, speed, recovery, and, probably, actually, hindered, it, by, its, support, of, restrictionism, and, price, raising, the, nra, could, maintain, a, sense, of, national, interest, against, private, interests, only, so, long, as, the, spirit, of, national, crisis, prevailed, as, it, faded, restriction, minded, businessmen, moved, into, a, decisive, position, of, authority, by, delegating, power, over, price, and, production, to, trade, associations, the, nra, created, a, series, of, private, economic, governments, other, labor, measures, were, carried, out, under, the, first, new, deal, the, wagner, peyser, act, of, 1933, established, a, national, system, of, public, employment, offices, and, the, anti, kickback, act, of, 1934, established, penalties, for, employers, on, government, contracts, who, induce, employees, to, return, any, part, of, pay, to, which, they, are, entitled, that, same, year, the, railway, labor, act, of, 1926, was, amended, to, outlaw, company, unions, and, yellow, dog, contracts, and, to, provide, that, the, majority, of, any, craft, or, class, of, employees, shall, determine, who, shall, represent, them, in, collective, bargaining, in, july, 1933, secretary, of, labor, frances, perkins, held, at, the, department, of, labor, what, was, described, as, a, very, successful, conference, of, 16, state, minimum, wage, boards, some, of, the, states, had, minimum, wage, laws, long, before, the, federal, government, the, following, year, she, held, a, two, day, conference, on, state, labor, legislation, in, which, 39, states, were, represented, according, to, one, study, state, officials, in, attendance, were, gratified, that, the, u, s, department, of, labor, was, showing, interest, in, their, problems, they, called, on, perkins, to, make, the, labor, legislation, conferences, an, annual, event, she, did, so, and, participated, actively, in, them, every, year, until, she, left, office, the, conferences, continued, under, labor, department, auspices, for, another, ten, years, by, which, time, they, had, largely, accomplished, their, goal, of, improving, and, standardizing, state, labor, laws, and, administration, as, a, means, of, institutionalizing, the, work, she, tried, to, achieve, with, these, conferences, perkins, established, the, division, of, labor, standards, which, was, later, redesignated, a, bureau, in, 1934, as, a, service, agency, and, informational, clearinghouse, for, state, governments, and, other, federal, agencies, its, goal, was, to, promote, through, voluntary, means, improved, conditions, of, work, and, the, division, offered, many, services, in, addition, to, helping, the, states, deal, with, administrative, problems, it, offered, for, instance, training, for, factory, inspectors, and, drew, national, attention, to, the, area, of, workers, health, with, a, series, of, conferences, on, silicosis, this, wide, spread, lung, disease, had, been, dramatized, by, the, gauley, bridge, disaster, in, which, hundreds, of, tunnel, workers, died, from, breathing, silica, filled, air, the, division, also, worked, with, unions, whose, support, was, needed, in, passing, labor, legislation, in, the, states, the, muscle, shoals, act, contained, various, provisions, of, interest, to, labor, including, prevailing, wage, rate, and, workmen, s, compensation, a, resolution, approved, by, the, senate, june, 13, authorized, the, president, to, accept, membership, for, the, government, of, the, united, states, in, the, international, labor, organization, without, assuming, any, obligation, under, the, covenant, of, the, league, of, nations, the, resolution, was, approved, by, the, house, june, 16, by, a, vote, of, 232, to, 109, public, act, 448, amended, the, federal, employees, civil, service, retirement, act, of, 1930, by, as, noted, by, one, study, giving, to, the, employee, the, right, to, name, a, beneficiary, irrespective, of, the, amount, to, his, credit, without, the, need, of, an, appointment, of, an, administrator, public, act, no, 245, provided, for, the, development, of, vocational, education, in, the, states, by, appropriating, funds, for, the, fiscal, years, 1935, 1936, and, 1937, and, public, act, 296, amended, the, united, states, bankruptcy, act, with, safeguards, for, labor, public, act, no, 349, provided, for, hourly, rates, of, pay, for, substitute, laborers, in, the, mail, service, and, time, credits, when, appointed, as, regular, laborers, and, public, act, no, 461, authorized, the, president, to, create, a, federal, prison, industries, in, which, inmates, hereafter, receiving, injuries, while, in, the, course, of, their, employment, will, receive, the, benefits, of, compensation, limited, however, to, that, amount, prescribed, in, the, federal, employees, compensation, act, public, act, no, 467, created, a, federal, credit, union, law, one, of, the, main, purposes, of, which, was, to, make, a, system, of, credit, for, provident, purposes, available, to, people, of, small, means, for, those, in, the, district, of, columbia, an, act, concerning, fire, escapes, on, certain, buildings, was, amended, by, public, act, no, 284, the, new, deal, had, an, important, impact, on, the, housing, field, the, new, deal, followed, and, increased, president, hoover, s, lead, and, seek, measures, the, new, deal, sought, to, stimulate, the, private, home, building, industry, and, increase, the, number, of, individuals, who, owned, homes, the, public, works, administration, of, the, interior, department, planned, to, construct, public, housing, across, the, country, providing, low, rent, apartments, for, low, income, families, however, resistance, from, the, private, housing, sector, was, strong, except, in, new, york, city, which, welcomed, the, program, furthermore, the, white, house, reallocated, most, of, the, funding, into, relief, projects, where, each, million, federal, dollars, would, create, more, jobs, for, the, unemployed, as, a, result, by, 1937, there, were, only, 49, projects, nationwide, containing, about, 21, 800, apartments, it, was, taken, over, in, 1938, by, the, federal, housing, administration, fha, starting, in, 1933, the, new, deal, operated, the, new, home, owners, loan, corporation, holc, that, helped, finance, mortgages, on, private, houses, holc, set, uniform, national, appraisal, methods, and, simplified, the, mortgage, process, the, federal, housing, administration, fha, created, national, standards, for, home, construction, in, 1934, the, alley, dwelling, authority, was, established, by, congress, to, provide, for, the, discontinuation, of, the, use, as, dwellings, of, the, buildings, situated, in, alleys, in, the, district, of, columbia, that, year, a, national, housing, act, was, approved, which, was, aimed, at, improving, employment, while, making, private, credit, available, for, repairing, and, homebuilding, in, 1938, this, act, was, amended, and, as, noted, by, one, study, provision, was, made, renewing, the, insurance, on, repair, loans, for, insuring, mortgages, up, to, 90, percent, of, the, value, of, small, owner, occupied, homes, and, for, insuring, mortgages, on, rental, property, this, also, marked, the, beginning, of, discriminatory, redlining, within, the, united, states, under, the, holc, their, maps, broadly, determined, what, housing, loans, would, be, backed, by, the, federal, government, though, other, criteria, existed, the, most, major, criterion, was, race, any, neighborhood, with, inharmonious, racial, groups, would, either, be, marked, red, or, yellow, depending, on, the, proportion, of, black, residents, this, was, explicitly, stated, within, the, fha, underwriting, manual, that, the, holc, used, as, a, guideline, for, its, maps, alongside, other, discriminatory, housing, policy, this, meant, in, practice, is, that, black, americans, were, denied, federally, backed, mortgages, locking, most, out, of, the, housing, market, and, all, americans, were, denied, backing, for, any, loans, within, black, neighborhood, lastly, for, the, other, policies, in, place, meant, for, neighborhood, building, projects, the, federal, government, required, they, be, explicitly, segregated, to, be, backed, the, federal, government, s, financial, backing, also, required, the, use, of, racially, restrictive, covenants, that, banned, white, homeowners, from, reselling, their, house, to, any, black, buyers, reform, was, based, on, the, assumption, that, the, depression, was, caused, by, the, inherent, instability, of, the, market, and, that, government, intervention, was, necessary, to, rationalize, and, stabilize, the, economy, and, to, balance, the, interests, of, farmers, business, and, labor, reforms, targeted, the, causes, of, the, depression, and, sought, to, prevent, a, crisis, like, it, from, happening, again, in, other, words, this, sought, to, financially, rebuild, the, u, s, while, ensuring, not, to, repeat, history, most, economic, historians, assert, that, protectionist, policies, culminating, in, the, smoot, hawley, act, of, 1930, worsened, the, depression, roosevelt, already, spoke, against, the, act, while, campaigning, for, president, during, 1932, in, 1934, the, reciprocal, tariff, act, was, drafted, by, cordell, hull, it, gave, the, president, power, to, negotiate, bilateral, reciprocal, trade, agreements, with, other, countries, the, act, enabled, roosevelt, to, liberalize, american, trade, policy, around, the, globe, and, it, is, widely, credited, with, ushering, in, the, era, of, liberal, trade, policy, that, persists, to, this, day, the, puerto, rico, reconstruction, administration, oversaw, a, separate, set, of, programs, in, puerto, rico, it, promoted, land, reform, and, helped, small, farms, it, set, up, farm, cooperatives, promoted, crop, diversification, and, helped, the, local, industry, in, the, spring, of, 1935, responding, to, the, setbacks, in, the, court, a, new, skepticism, in, congress, and, the, growing, popular, clamor, for, more, dramatic, action, new, dealers, passed, important, new, initiatives, historians, refer, to, them, as, the, second, new, deal, and, note, that, it, was, more, progressive, and, more, controversial, than, the, first, new, deal, of, 1933, 1934, until, 1935, only, a, dozen, states, had, implemented, old, age, insurance, and, these, programs, were, woefully, underfunded, just, one, state, wisconsin, had, an, insurance, program, the, united, states, was, the, only, modern, industrial, country, where, people, faced, the, depression, without, any, national, system, of, social, security, the, work, programs, of, the, first, new, deal, such, as, cwa, and, fera, were, designed, for, immediate, relief, for, a, year, or, two, the, most, important, program, of, 1935, and, perhaps, of, the, new, deal, itself, was, the, social, security, act, it, established, a, permanent, system, of, universal, retirement, pensions, social, security, unemployment, insurance, and, welfare, benefits, for, the, handicapped, and, needy, children, in, families, without, a, father, present, it, established, the, framework, for, the, u, s, welfare, system, roosevelt, insisted, that, it, should, be, funded, by, payroll, taxes, rather, than, from, the, general, fund, he, said, we, put, those, payroll, contributions, there, so, as, to, give, the, contributors, a, legal, moral, and, political, right, to, collect, their, pensions, and, unemployment, benefits, with, those, taxes, in, there, no, damn, politician, can, ever, scrap, my, social, security, program, the, national, labor, relations, act, of, 1935, also, known, as, the, wagner, act, finally, guaranteed, workers, the, rights, to, collective, bargaining, through, unions, of, their, own, choice, the, act, also, established, the, national, labor, relations, board, nlrb, to, facilitate, wage, agreements, and, to, suppress, the, repeated, labor, disturbances, the, wagner, act, did, not, compel, employers, to, reach, agreement, with, their, employees, but, it, opened, possibilities, for, american, labor, the, result, was, a, tremendous, growth, of, membership, in, the, labor, unions, especially, in, the, mass, production, sector, led, by, the, older, and, larger, american, federation, of, labor, and, the, new, more, radical, congress, of, industrial, organizations, labor, thus, became, a, major,

hopkins, roosevelt, had, insisted, that, the, projects, had, to, be, costly, in, terms, of, labor, beneficial, in, the, long, term, and, the, wpa, was, forbidden, to, compete, with, private,

but, new, york, city, had, its, own, branch, federal, one, which, created, jobs, for, writers, musicians, artists, and, theater, personnel, it, became, a, hunting, ground, for, conservatives, searching, for, communist, employees, the, federal, writers, project, operated, in, every, state, where, it, created, a, famous, guide, book, it, also, catalogued, local, archives, and, hired, many,

by, the, treasury, relief, art, project, of, the, treasury, department, during, its, existence, the, federal, theatre, project, provided, jobs, for, circus, people, musicians, actors, artists, and, playwrights, together, with, increasing, public, appreciation, of, the, arts, in, 1935, roosevelt, called, for, a, tax, program, called, the, wealth, tax, act, revenue, act, of, 1935, to, redistribute, wealth, the, bill, imposed, an, income, tax, of, 79, on, incomes, over, 5, million, since, that, was, an, extraordinarily, high, income, in, the, 1930s, the, highest, tax, rate, actually, covered, just, one, individual, john, d, rockefeller, the, bill, was, expected, to, raise, only, about, 250, million, in, additional, funds, so, revenue, was, not, the, primary, goal, morgenthau, called, it, more, or, less, a, campaign, document, in, a, private, conversation, with, raymond, moley, roosevelt, admitted, that, the, purpose, of, the, bill, was, stealing, huey, long, s, thunder, by, making, long, s, supporters, of, his, own, at, the, same, time, it, raised, the, bitterness, of, the, rich, who, called, roosevelt, a, traitor, to, his, class, and, the, wealth, tax, act, a, soak, the, rich, tax, a, tax, called, the, undistributed, profits, tax, was, enacted, in, 1936, this, time, the, primary, purpose, was, revenue, since, congress, had, enacted, the, adjusted, compensation, payment, act, calling, for, payments, of, 2, billion, to, world, war, i, veterans, the, bill, established, the, persisting, principle, that, retained, corporate, earnings, could, be, taxed, paid, dividends, were, tax, deductible, by, corporations, its, proponents, intended, the, bill, to, replace, all, other, corporation, taxes, believing, this, would, stimulate, corporations, to, distribute, earnings, and, thus, put, more, cash, and, spending, power, in, the, hands, of, individuals, in, the, end, congress, watered, down, the, bill, setting, the, tax, rates, at, 7, to, 27, and, largely, exempting, small, enterprises, facing, widespread, and, fierce, criticism, the, tax, deduction, of, paid, dividends, was, repealed, in, 1938, the, united, states, housing, act, of, 1937, created, the, united, states, housing, authority, within, the, u, s, department, of, the, interior, it, was, one, of, the, last, new, deal, agencies, created, the, bill, passed, in, 1937, with, some, republican, support, to, abolish, slums, by, 1936, the, term, progressive, was, typically, used, for, supporters, of, the, new, deal, and, conservative, for, its, opponents, roosevelt, was, assisted, in, his, endeavors, by, the, election, of, a, liberal, congress, in, 1932, according, to, one, source, we, recognize, that, the, best, liberal, legislation, in, american, history, was, enacted, following, the, election, of, president, roosevelt, and, a, liberal, congress, in, 1932, after, the, midterm, congressional, election, setbacks, in, 1938, labor, was, faced, with, a, hostile, congress, until, 1946, only, the, presidential, veto, prevented, the, enactment, of, reactionary, anti, labor, laws, in, noting, the, composition, of, the, seventy, third, congress, one, study, has, stated, though, much, of, the, democratic, congressional, leadership, remained, old, guard, southern, agrarian, and, conservative, the, rank, and, file, democratic, majorities, in, both, houses, were, largely, made, up, of, fresh, northern, urban, industrial, representatives, of, at, least, potentially, liberal, bent, at, a, minimum, they, were, impatient, with, inaction, and, not, likely, to, be, silenced, by, appeals, to, tradition, they, were, as, yet, an, unformed, and, reckoned, force, one, that, roosevelt, might, mould, to, his, purposes, of, remaking, his, party, or, one, whose, very, strength, and, impetuosity, might, force, the, president, s, hand, as, stated, by, another, study, in, regards, to, the, gains, the, democrats, made, in, the, 1932, midterm, elections, the, party, gained, ninety, seats, in, the, house, and, thirteen, in, the, senate, even, more, significant, from, the, standpoint, of, potential, support, for, urban, programs, was, that, non, southern, democrats, represented, a, working, majority, in, the, house, for, the, first, of, what, would, be, only, a, few, times, in, the, twentieth, century, roosevelt, s, political, instincts, mood, paralleled, the, mood, of, congress, and, he, sought, policies, to, tie, the, party, s, new, urban, supporters, into, a, permanent, majority, coalition, behind, the, democratic, party, as, noted, by, another, study, president, roosevelt, s, extraordinary, legislative, accomplishments, between, 1933, and, 1938, owed, much, to, his, personal, political, qualities, but, ideologically, favourable, large, partisan, majorities, in, the, house, and, the, senate, were, a, prerequisite, of, success, as, one, journal, reflected, in, 1950, look, back, to, the, 1930, s, and, you, can, see, how, winning, in, mid, terms, years, affects, the, kind, of, laws, that, are, passed, a, tremendous, liberal, majority, was, swept, in, with, franklin, roosevelt, in, 1932, in, the, 1934, mid, term, races, that, liberal, majority, was, increased, after, 1936, it, went, even, higher, from, 1934, to, 1938, there, existed, a, pro, spender, majority, in, congress, drawn, from, two, party, competitive, non, machine, progressive, and, left, party, districts, in, the, 1938, midterm, election, roosevelt, and, his, progressive, supporters, lost, control, of, congress, to, the, bipartisan, conservative, coalition, many, historians, distinguish, between, the, first, new, deal, 1933, 1934, and, a, second, new, deal, 1935, 1936, with, the, second, one, more, progressive, and, more, controversial, when, the, supreme, court, started, abolishing, new, deal, programs, as, unconstitutional, roosevelt, launched, a, surprise, counter, attack, in, early, 1937, he, proposed, adding, five, new, justices, but, conservative, democrats, revolted, led, by, the, vice, president, the, judiciary, reorganization, bill, of, 1937, failed, it, never, reached, a, vote, momentum, in, congress, and, public, opinion, shifted, to, the, right, and, very, little, new, legislation, was, passed, expanding, the, new, deal, however, retirements, allowed, roosevelt, to, put, supporters, on, the, court, and, it, stopped, killing, new, deal, programs, the, roosevelt, administration, was, under, assault, during, roosevelt, s, second, term, which, presided, over, a, new, dip, in, the, great, depression, in, the, fall, of, 1937, that, continued, through, most, of, 1938, production, and, profits, declined, sharply, unemployment, jumped, from, 14, 3, in, may, 1937, to, 19, 0, in, june, 1938, the, downturn, could, have, been, explained, by, the, familiar, rhythms, of, the, business, cycle, but, until, 1937, roosevelt, had, claimed, responsibility, for, the, excellent, economic, performance, that, backfired, in, the, recession, and, the, heated, political, atmosphere, of, 1937, john, maynard, keynes, did, not, think, that, the, new, deal, under, roosevelt, single, handedly, ended, the, great, depression, it, is, it, seems, politically, impossible, for, a, capitalistic, democracy, to, organize, expenditure, on, the, scale, necessary, to, make, the, grand, experiments, which, would, prove, my, case, except, in, war, conditions, the, u, s, reached, full, employment, after, entering, world, war, ii, in, december, 1941, under, the, special, circumstances, of, war, mobilization, massive, war, spending, doubled, the, gross, national, product, gnp, military, keynesianism, brought, full, employment, and, federal, contracts, were, cost, plus, instead, of, competitive, bidding, to, get, lower, prices, the, government, gave, out, contracts, that, promised, to, pay, all, the, expenses, plus, a, modest, profit, factories, hired, everyone, they, could, find, regardless, of, their, lack, of, skills, they, simplified, work, tasks, and, trained, the, workers, with, the, federal, government, paying, all, the, costs, millions, of, farmers, left, marginal, operations, students, quit, school, and, housewives, joined, the, labor, force, the, emphasis, was, for, war, supplies, as, soon, as, possible, regardless, of, cost, and, inefficiencies, industry, quickly, absorbed, the, slack, in, the, labor, force, and, the, tables, turned, such, that, employers, needed, to, actively, and, aggressively, recruit, workers, as, the, military, grew, new, labor, sources, were, needed, to, replace, the, 12, million, men, serving, in, the, military, propaganda, campaigns, started, pleading, for, people, to, work, in, the, war, factories, the, barriers, for, married, women, the, old, the, unskilled, and, in, the, north, and, west, the, barriers, for, racial, minorities, were, lowered, in, 1929, federal, expenditures, accounted, for, only, 3, of, gnp, between, 1933, and, 1939, federal, expenditures, tripled, but, the, national, debt, as, a, percent, of, gnp, showed, little, change, spending, on, the, war, effort, quickly, eclipsed, spending, on, new, deal, programs, in, 1944, government, spending, on, the, war, effort, exceeded, 40, of, gnp, these, controls, shared, broad, support, among, labor, and, business, resulting, in, cooperation, between, the, two, groups, and, the, u, s, government, this, cooperation, resulted, in, the, government, subsidizing, business, and, labor, through, both, direct, and, indirect, methods, conservative, domination, of, congress, during, the, war, meant, that, all, welfare, projects, and, reforms, had, to, have, their, approval, which, was, given, when, business, supported, the, project, for, example, the, coal, mines, inspection, and, investigation, act, of, 1941, significantly, reduced, fatality, rates, in, the, coal, mining, industry, saving, workers, lives, and, company, money, in, terms, of, welfare, the, new, dealers, wanted, benefits, for, everyone, according, to, need, however, conservatives, proposed, benefits, based, on, national, service, especially, tied, to, military, service, or, working, in, war, industries, and, their, approach, won, out, the, community, facilities, act, of, 1940, the, lanham, act, provided, federal, funds, to, defense, impacted, communities, where, the, population, had, soared, and, local, facilities, were, overwhelmed, it, provided, money, for, the, building, of, segregated, housing, for, war, workers, as, well, as, recreational, facilities, water, and, sanitation, plants, hospitals, day, care, centers, and, schools, the, servicemen, s, dependents, allowance, act, of, 1942, provided, family, allowances, for, dependents, of, enlisted, men, emergency, grants, to, states, were, authorized, in, 1942, for, programs, for, day, care, for, children, of, working, mothers, in, 1944, pensions, were, authorized, for, all, physically, or, mentally, helpless, children, of, deceased, veterans, regardless, of, the, age, of, the, child, at, the, date, the, claim, was, filed, or, at, the, time, of, the, veteran, s, death, provided, the, child, was, disabled, at, the, age, of, sixteen, and, that, the, disability, continued, to, the, date, of, the, claim, the, public, health, service, act, which, was, passed, that, same, year, expanded, federal, state, public, health, programs, and, increased, the, annual, amount, for, grants, for, public, health, services, the, emergency, maternity, and, infant, care, program, emic, introduced, in, march, 1943, by, the, children, s, bureau, provided, free, maternity, care, and, medical, treatment, during, an, infant, s, first, year, for, the, wives, and, children, of, military, personnel, in, the, four, lowest, enlisted, pay, grades, one, out, of, seven, births, was, covered, during, its, operation, emic, paid, 127, million, to, state, health, departments, to, cover, the, care, of, 1, 2, million, new, mothers, and, their, babies, the, average, cost, of, emic, maternity, cases, completed, was, 92, 49, for, medical, and, hospital, care, a, striking, effect, was, the, sudden, rapid, decline, in, home, births, as, most, mothers, now, had, paid, hospital, maternity, care, under, the, 1943, disabled, veterans, rehabilitation, act, vocational, rehabilitation, services, were, offered, to, wounded, world, war, ii, veterans, and, some, 621, 000, veterans, would, go, on, to, receive, assistance, under, this, program, the, g, i, bill, servicemen, s, readjustment, act, of, 1944, was, a, landmark, piece, of, legislation, providing, 16, million, returning, veterans, with, benefits, such, as, housing, educational, and, unemployment, assistance, and, played, a, major, role, in, the, postwar, expansion, of, the, american, middle, class, in, response, to, the, march, on, washington, movement, led, by, a, philip, randolph, roosevelt, promulgated, executive, order, 8802, in, june, 1941, which, established, the, president, s, committee, on, fair, employment, practices, fepc, to, receive, and, investigate, complaints, of, discrimination, so, that, there, shall, be, no, discrimination, in, the, employment, of, workers, in, defense, industries, or, government, because, of, race, creed, color, or, national, origin, a, major, result, of, the, full, employment, at, high, wages, was, a, sharp, long, lasting, decrease, in, the, level, of, income, inequality, great, compression, the, gap, between, rich, and, poor, narrowed, dramatically, in, the, area, of, nutrition, because, food, rationing, and, price, controls, provided, a, reasonably, priced, diet, to, everyone, white, collar, workers, did, not, typically, receive, overtime, and, therefore, the, gap, between, white, collar, and, blue, collar, income, narrowed, large, families, that, had, been, poor, during, the, 1930s, had, four, or, more, wage, earners, and, these, families, shot, to, the, top, one, third, income, bracket, overtime, provided, large, paychecks, in, war, industries, and, average, living, standards, rose, steadily, with, real, wages, rising, by, 44, in, the, four, years, of, war, while, the, percentage, of, families, with, an, annual, income, of, less, than, 2, 000, fell, from, 75, to, 25, of, the, population, in, 1941, 40, of, all, american, families, lived, on, less, than, the, 1, 500, per, year, defined, as, necessary, by, the, works, progress, administration, for, a, modest, standard, of, living, the, median, income, stood, at, 2, 000, per, year, and, 8, million, workers, earned, below, the, legal, minimum, from, 1939, to, 1944, wages, and, salaries, more, than, doubled, with, overtime, pay, and, the, expansion, of, jobs, leading, to, a, 70, rise, in, average, weekly, earnings, during, the, course, of, the, war, membership, in, organized, labor, increased, by, 50, between, 1941, and, 1945, and, because, the, war, labor, board, sought, labor, management, peace, new, workers, were, encouraged, to, participate, in, the, existing, labor, organizations, thereby, receiving, all, the, benefits, of, union, membership, such, as, improved, working, conditions, better, fringe, benefits, and, higher, wages, as, noted, by, william, h, chafe, with, full, employment, higher, wages, and, social, welfare, benefits, provided, under, government, regulations, american, workers, experienced, a, level, of, well, being, that, for, many, had, never, occurred, before, according, to, one, study, over, 60, of, americans, lived, in, poverty, in, 1933, and, under, 40, did, so, by, 1945, as, a, result, of, the, new, prosperity, consumer, expenditures, rose, by, nearly, 50, from, 61, 7, billion, at, the, start, of, the, war, to, 98, 5, billion, by, 1944, individual, savings, accounts, climbed, almost, sevenfold, during, the, course, of, the, war, the, share, of, total, income, held, by, the, top, 5, of, wage, earners, fell, from, 22, to, 17, while, the, bottom, 40, increased, their, share, of, the, economic, pie, in, addition, during, the, course, of, the, war, the, proportion, of, the, american, population, earning, less, than, 3, 000, in, 1968, dollars, fell, by, half, according, to, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, perhaps, the, greatest, achievement, of, the, new, deal, was, to, restore, faith, in, american, democracy, at, a, time, when, many, people, believed, that, the, only, choice, left, was, between, communism, and, fascism, analysts, agree, the, new, deal, produced, a, new, political, coalition, that, sustained, the, democratic, party, as, the, majority, party, in, national, politics, into, the, 1960s, a, 2013, study, found, an, average, increase, in, new, deal, relief, and, public, works, spending, resulted, in, a, 5, 4, percentage, point, increase, in, the, 1936, democratic, voting, share, and, a, smaller, amount, in, 1940, the, estimated, persistence, of, this, shift, suggests, that, new, deal, spending, increased, long, term, democratic, support, by, 2, to, 2, 5, percentage, points, thus, it, appears, that, roosevelt, s, early, decisive, actions, created, long, lasting, positive, benefits, for, the, democratic, party, the, new, deal, did, play, an, important, role, in, consolidating, democratic, gains, for, at, least, two, decades, however, there, is, disagreement, about, whether, it, marked, a, permanent, change, in, values, cowie, and, salvatore, in, 2008, argued, that, it, was, a, response, to, depression, and, did, not, mark, a, commitment, to, a, welfare, state, because, the, u, s, has, always, been, too, individualistic, maclean, rejected, the, idea, of, a, definitive, political, culture, she, says, they, overemphasized, individualism, and, ignored, the, enormous, power, that, big, capital, wields, the, constitutional, restraints, on, radicalism, and, the, role, of, racism, antifeminism, and, homophobia, she, warns, that, accepting, cowie, and, salvatore, s, argument, that, conservatism, s, ascendancy, is, inevitable, would, dismay, and, discourage, activists, on, the, left, klein, responds, that, the, new, deal, did, not, die, a, natural, death, it, was, killed, off, in, the, 1970s, by, a, business, coalition, mobilized, by, such, groups, as, the, business, roundtable, the, chamber, of, commerce, trade, organizations, conservative, think, tanks, and, decades, of, sustained, legal, and, political, attacks, historians, generally, agree, that, during, roosevelt, s, 12, years, in, office, there, was, a, dramatic, increase, in, the, power, of, the, federal, government, as, a, whole, roosevelt, also, established, the, presidency, as, the, prominent, center, of, authority, within, the, federal, government, roosevelt, created, a, large, array, of, agencies, protecting, various, groups, of, citizens, workers, farmers, and, others, who, suffered, from, the, crisis, and, thus, enabled, them, to, challenge, the, powers, of, the, corporations, in, this, way, the, roosevelt, administration, generated, a, set, of, political, ideas, known, as, new, deal, progressivism, that, remained, a, source, of, inspiration, and, controversy, for, decades, new, deal, liberalism, lay, the, foundation, of, a, new, consensus, between, 1940, and, 1980, there, was, the, progressive, consensus, about, the, prospects, for, the, widespread, distribution, of, prosperity, within, an, expanding, capitalist, economy, especially, harry, s, truman, s, fair, deal, and, in, the, 1960s, lyndon, b, johnson, s, great, society, used, the, new, deal, as, inspiration, for, a, dramatic, expansion, of, progressive, programs, the, new, deal, s, enduring, appeal, on, voters, fostered, its, acceptance, by, moderate, and, progressive, republicans, as, the, first, republican, president, elected, after, roosevelt, dwight, d, eisenhower, 1953, 1961, built, on, the, new, deal, in, a, manner, that, embodied, his, thoughts, on, efficiency, and, cost, effectiveness, he, sanctioned, a, major, expansion, of, social, security, by, a, self, financed, program, he, supported, such, new, deal, programs, as, the, minimum, wage, and, public, housing, he, greatly, expanded, federal, aid, to, education, and, built, the, interstate, highway, system, primarily, as, defense, programs, rather, than, jobs, program, in, a, private, letter, eisenhower, wrote, should, any, party, attempt, to, abolish, social, security, and, eliminate, labor, laws, and, farm, programs, you, would, not, hear, of, that, party, again, in, our, political, history, there, is, a, tiny, splinter, group, of, course, that, believes, you, can, do, these, things, their, number, is, negligible, and, they, are, stupid, in, 1964, barry, goldwater, an, unreconstructed, anti, new, dealer, was, the, republican, presidential, candidate, on, a, platform, that, attacked, the, new, deal, the, democrats, under, lyndon, b, johnson, won, a, massive, landslide, and, johnson, s, great, society, programs, extended, the, new, deal, however, the, supporters, of, goldwater, formed, the, new, right, which, helped, to, bring, ronald, reagan, into, the, white, house, in, the, 1980, presidential, election, once, an, ardent, supporter, of, the, new, deal, reagan, turned, against, it, now, viewing, government, as, the, problem, rather, than, solution, and, as, president, moved, the, nation, away, from, the, new, deal, model, of, government, activism, shifting, greater, emphasis, to, the, private, sector, a, 2016, review, study, of, the, existing, literature, in, the, journal, of, economic, literature, summarized, the, findings, of, the, research, as, follows, the, studies, find, that, public, works, and, relief, spending, had, state, income, multipliers, of, around, one, increased, consumption, activity, attracted, internal, migration, reduced, crime, rates, and, lowered, several, types, of, mortality, the, farm, programs, typically, aided, large, farm, owners, but, eliminated, opportunities, for, share, croppers, tenants, and, farm, workers, the, home, owners, loan, corporation, s, purchases, and, refinancing, of, troubled, mortgages, staved, off, drops, in, housing, prices, and, home, ownership, rates, at, relatively, low, ex, post, cost, to, taxpayers, the, reconstruction, finance, corporation, s, loans, to, banks, and, railroads, appear, to, have, had, little, positive, impact, although, the, banks, were, aided, when, the, rfc, took, ownership, stakes, historians, debating, the, new, deal, have, generally, been, divided, between, progressives, who, support, it, conservatives, who, oppose, it, and, some, new, left, historians, who, complain, it, was, too, favorable, to, capitalism, and, did, too, little, for, minorities, there, is, consensus, on, only, a, few, points, with, most, commentators, favorable, toward, the, ccc, and, hostile, toward, the, nra, consensus, historians, of, the, 1950s, such, as, richard, hofstadter, according, to, lary, may, progressive, historians, argue, that, roosevelt, restored, hope, and, self, respect, to, tens, of, millions, of, desperate, people, built, labor, unions, upgraded, the, national, infrastructure, and, saved, capitalism, in, his, first, term, when, he, could, have, destroyed, it, and, easily, nationalized, the, banks, and, the, railroads, historians, generally, agree, that, apart, from, building, up, labor, unions, the, new, deal, did, not, substantially, alter, the, distribution, of, power, within, american, capitalism, the, new, deal, brought, about, limited, change, in, the, nation, s, power, structure, the, new, deal, preserved, democracy, in, the, united, states, in, a, historic, period, of, uncertainty, and, crises, when, in, many, other, countries, democracy, failed, the, most, common, arguments, can, be, summarized, as, follows, julian, zelizer, 2000, has, argued, that, fiscal, conservatism, was, a, key, component, of, the, new, deal, a, fiscally, conservative, approach, was, supported, by, wall, street, and, local, investors, and, most, of, the, business, community, mainstream, academic, economists, believed, in, it, as, apparently, did, the, majority, of, the, public, conservative, southern, democrats, who, favored, balanced, budgets, and, opposed, new, taxes, controlled, congress, and, its, major, committees, even, progressive, democrats, at, the, time, regarded, balanced, budgets, as, essential, to, economic, stability, in, the, long, run, although, they, were, more, willing, to, accept, short, term, deficits, as, zelizer, notes, public, opinion, polls, consistently, showed, public, opposition, to, deficits, and, debt, throughout, his, terms, roosevelt, recruited, fiscal, conservatives, to, serve, in, his, administration, most, notably, lewis, douglas, the, director, of, budget, in, 1933, 1934, and, henry, morgenthau, jr, secretary, of, the, treasury, from, 1934, to, 1945, they, defined, policy, in, terms, of, budgetary, cost, and, tax, burdens, rather, than, needs, rights, obligations, or, political, benefits, personally, roosevelt, embraced, their, fiscal, conservatism, but, politically, he, realized, that, fiscal, conservatism, enjoyed, a, strong, wide, base, of, support, among, voters, leading, democrats, and, businessmen, on, the, other, hand, there, was, enormous, pressure, to, act, and, spending, money, on, high, visibility, work, programs, with, millions, of, paychecks, a, week, douglas, proved, too, inflexible, and, he, quit, in, 1934, morgenthau, made, it, his, highest, priority, to, stay, close, to, roosevelt, no, matter, what, douglas, s, position, like, many, of, the, old, right, was, grounded, in, a, basic, distrust, of, politicians, and, the, deeply, ingrained, fear, that, government, spending, always, involved, a, degree, of, patronage, and, corruption, that, offended, his, progressive, sense, of, efficiency, the, economy, act, of, 1933, passed, early, in, the, hundred, days, was, douglas, s, great, achievement, it, reduced, federal, expenditures, by, 500, million, to, be, achieved, by, reducing, veterans, payments, and, federal, salaries, douglas, cut, government, spending, through, executive, orders, that, cut, the, military, budget, by, 125, million, 75, million, from, the, post, office, 12, million, from, commerce, 75, million, from, government, salaries, and, 100, million, from, staff, layoffs, as, freidel, concludes, the, economy, program, was, not, a, minor, aberration, of, the, spring, of, 1933, or, a, hypocritical, concession, to, delighted, conservatives, rather, it, was, an, integral, part, of, roosevelt, s, overall, new, deal, revenues, were, so, low, that, borrowing, was, necessary, only, the, richest, 3, paid, any, income, tax, between, 1926, and, 1940, douglas, therefore, hated, the, relief, programs, which, he, said, reduced, business, confidence, threatened, the, government, s, future, credit, and, had, the, destructive, psychological, effects, of, making, mendicants, of, self, respecting, american, citizens, roosevelt, was, pulled, toward, greater, spending, by, hopkins, and, ickes, and, as, the, 1936, election, approached, he, decided, to, gain, votes, by, attacking, big, business, morgenthau, shifted, with, roosevelt, but, at, all, times, tried, to, inject, fiscal, responsibility, he, deeply, believed, in, balanced, budgets, stable, currency, reduction, of, the, national, debt, and, the, need, for, more, private, investment, the, wagner, act, met, morgenthau, s, requirement, because, it, strengthened, the, party, s, political, base, and, involved, no, new, spending, in, contrast, to, douglas, morgenthau, accepted, roosevelt, s, double, budget, as, legitimate, that, is, a, balanced, regular, budget, and, an, emergency, budget, for, agencies, like, the, wpa, pwa, and, ccc, that, would, be, temporary, until, full, recovery, was, at, hand, he, fought, against, the, veterans, bonus, until, congress, finally, overrode, roosevelt, s, veto, and, gave, out, 2, 2, billion, in, 1936, his, biggest, success, was, the, new, social, security, program, as, he, managed, to, reverse, the, proposals, to, fund, it, from, general, revenue, and, insisted, it, be, funded, by, new, taxes, on, employees, it, was, morgenthau, who, insisted, on, excluding, farm, workers, and, domestic, servants, from, social, security, because, workers, outside, industry, would, not, be, paying, their, way, while, many, americans, suffered, economically, during, the, great, depression, african, americans, also, had, to, deal, with, social, ills, such, as, racism, discrimination, and, segregation, black, workers, were, especially, vulnerable, to, the, economic, downturn, since, most, of, them, worked, the, most, marginal, jobs, such, as, unskilled, or, service, oriented, work, therefore, they, were, the, first, to, be, discharged, and, additionally, many, employers, preferred, white, workers, when, jobs, were, scarce, some, employers, even, dismissed, black, workers, to, create, jobs, for, white, citizens, in, the, end, there, were, three, times, more, african, american, workers, on, public, assistance, or, relief, than, white, workers, roosevelt, appointed, an, unprecedented, number, of, african, americans, to, second, level, positions, in, his, administration, these, appointees, were, collectively, called, the, black, cabinet, the, wpa, nya, and, ccc, relief, programs, allocated, 10, of, their, budgets, to, blacks, who, comprised, about, 10, of, the, total, population, and, 20, of, the, poor, they, operated, separate, all, black, units, with, the, same, pay, and, conditions, as, white, units, some, leading, white, new, dealers, especially, eleanor, roosevelt, harold, ickes, and, aubrey, williams, worked, to, ensure, blacks, received, at, least, 10, of, welfare, assistance, payments, however, these, benefits, were, small, in, comparison, to, the, economic, and, political, advantages, that, whites, received, most, unions, excluded, blacks, from, joining, and, enforcement, of, anti, discrimination, laws, in, the, south, was, virtually, impossible, especially, since, most, blacks, worked, in, hospitality, and, agricultural, sectors, the, new, deal, programs, put, millions, of, americans, immediately, back, to, work, or, at, least, helped, them, to, survive, the, programs, were, not, specifically, targeted, to, alleviate, the, much, higher, unemployment, rate, of, blacks, some, aspects, of, the, programs, were, even, unfavorable, to, blacks, the, agricultural, adjustment, acts, for, example, helped, farmers, which, were, predominantly, white, but, reduced, the, need, of, farmers, to, hire, tenant, farmers, or, sharecroppers, which, were, predominantly, black, though, the, aaa, stipulated, that, a, farmer, had, to, share, the, payments, with, those, who, worked, the, land, this, policy, was, never, enforced, the, farm, service, agency, fsa, a, government, relief, agency, for, tenant, farmers, created, in, 1937, made, efforts, to, empower, african, americans, by, appointing, them, to, agency, committees, in, the, south, senator, james, f, byrnes, of, south, carolina, raised, opposition, to, the, appointments, because, he, stood, for, white, farmers, who, were, threatened, by, an, agency, that, could, organize, and, empower, tenant, farmers, initially, the, fsa, stood, behind, their, appointments, but, after, feeling, national, pressure, fsa, was, forced, to, release, the, african, americans, from, their, positions, the, goals, of, the, fsa, were, notoriously, progressive, and, not, cohesive, with, the, southern, voting, elite, some, harmful, new, deal, measures, inadvertently, discriminated, against, blacks, thousands, of, blacks, were, thrown, out, of, work, and, replaced, by, whites, on, jobs, where, they, were, paid, less, than, the, nra, s, wage, minimums, because, some, white, employers, considered, the, nra, s, minimum, wage, too, much, money, for, negroes, by, august, 1933, blacks, called, the, nra, the, negro, removal, act, an, nra, study, found, that, the, nira, put, 500, 000, african, americans, out, of, work, however, since, blacks, felt, the, sting, of, the, depression, s, wrath, even, more, severely, than, whites, they, welcomed, any, help, in, 1936, almost, all, african, americans, and, many, whites, shifted, from, the, party, of, lincoln, to, the, democratic, party, this, was, a, sharp, realignment, from, 1932, when, most, african, americans, voted, the, republican, ticket, new, deal, policies, helped, establish, a, political, alliance, between, blacks, and, the, democratic, party, that, survives, into, the, 21st, century, there, was, no, attempt, whatsoever, to, end, segregation, or, to, increase, black, rights, in, the, south, and, a, number, of, leaders, that, promoted, the, new, deal, were, racist, and, anti, semitic, the, wartime, fair, employment, practices, commission, fepc, executive, orders, that, forbade, job, discrimination, against, african, americans, women, and, ethnic, groups, was, a, major, breakthrough, that, brought, better, jobs, and, pay, to, millions, of, minority, americans, historians, usually, treat, fepc, as, part, of, the, war, effort, and, not, part, of, the, new, deal, itself, the, new, deal, was, racially, segregated, as, blacks, and, whites, rarely, worked, alongside, each, other, in, new, deal, programs, the, largest, relief, program, by, far, was, the, wpa, it, operated, segregated, units, as, did, its, youth, affiliate, the, nya, blacks, were, hired, by, the, wpa, as, supervisors, in, the, north, but, of, 10, 000, wpa, supervisors, in, the, south, only, 11, were, black, historian, anthony, badger, said, new, deal, programs, in, the, south, routinely, discriminated, against, blacks, and, perpetuated, segregation, in, its, first, few, weeks, of, operation, ccc, camps, in, the, north, were, integrated, by, july, 1935, practically, all, the, camps, in, the, united, states, were, segregated, and, blacks, were, strictly, limited, in, the, supervisory, roles, they, were, assigned, kinker, and, smith, argue, even, the, most, prominent, racial, liberals, in, the, new, deal, did, not, dare, to, criticize, jim, crow, secretary, of, the, interior, harold, ickes, was, one, of, the, roosevelt, administration, s, most, prominent, supporters, of, blacks, and, former, president, of, the, chicago, chapter, of, the, naacp, in, 1937, when, senator, josiah, bailey, democrat, of, north, carolina, accused, him, of, trying, to, break, down, segregation, laws, ickes, wrote, him, to, deny, that, the, new, deal, s, record, came, under, attack, by, new, left, historians, in, the, 1960s, for, its, pusillanimity, in, not, attacking, capitalism, more, vigorously, nor, helping, blacks, achieve, equality, the, critics, emphasize, the, absence, of, a, philosophy, of, reform, to, explain, the, failure, of, new, dealers, to, attack, fundamental, social, problems, they, demonstrate, the, new, deal, s, commitment, to, save, capitalism, and, its, refusal, to, strip, away, private, property, they, detect, a, remoteness, from, the, people, and, indifference, to, participatory, democracy, and, call, instead, for, more, emphasis, on, conflict, and, exploitation, at, first, the, new, deal, created, programs, primarily, for, men, as, it, was, assumed, that, the, husband, was, the, breadwinner, the, provider, and, if, they, had, jobs, the, whole, family, would, benefit, it, was, the, social, norm, for, women, to, give, up, jobs, when, they, married, in, many, states, there, were, laws, that, prevented, both, husband, and, wife, holding, regular, jobs, with, the, government, so, too, in, the, relief, world, it, was, rare, for, both, husband, and, wife, to, have, a, relief, job, on, fera, or, the, wpa, this, prevailing, social, norm, of, the, breadwinner, failed, to, take, into, account, the, numerous, households, headed, by, women, but, it, soon, became, clear, that, the, government, needed, to, help, women, as, well, many, women, were, employed, on, fera, projects, run, by, the, states, with, federal, funds, the, first, new, deal, program, to, directly, assist, women, was, the, works, progress, administration, wpa, begun, in, 1935, it, hired, single, women, widows, or, women, with, disabled, or, absent, husbands, the, wpa, employed, about, 500, 000, women, and, they, were, assigned, mostly, to, unskilled, jobs, 295, 000, worked, on, sewing, projects, that, made, 300, million, items, of, clothing, and, bedding, to, be, given, away, to, families, on, relief, and, to, hospitals, and, orphanages, women, also, were, hired, for, the, wpa, s, school, lunch, program, both, men, and, women, were, hired, for, the, small, but, highly, publicized, arts, programs, such, as, music, theater, and, writing, the, new, deal, expanded, the, role, of, the, federal, government, particularly, to, help, the, poor, the, unemployed, youth, the, elderly, and, stranded, rural, communities, the, hoover, administration, started, the, system, of, funding, state, relief, programs, whereby, the, states, hired, people, on, relief, with, the, ccc, in, 1933, and, the, wpa, in, 1935, the, federal, government, now, became, involved, in, directly, hiring, people, on, relief, in, granting, direct, relief, or, benefits, total, federal, state, and, local, spending, on, relief, rose, from, 3, 9, of, gnp, in, 1929, to, 6, 4, in, 1932, and, 9, 7, in, 1934, the, return, of, prosperity, in, 1944, lowered, the, rate, to, 4, 1, in, 1935, 1940, welfare, spending, accounted, for, 49, of, the, federal, state, and, local, government, budgets, in, his, memoirs, milton, friedman, said, that, the, new, deal, relief, programs, were, an, appropriate, response, he, and, his, wife, were, not, on, relief, but, they, were, employed, by, the, wpa, as, statisticians, friedman, said, that, programs, like, the, ccc, and, wpa, were, justified, as, temporary, responses, to, an, emergency, friedman, said, that, roosevelt, deserved, considerable, credit, for, relieving, immediate, distress, and, restoring, confidence, roosevelt, s, new, deal, recovery, programs, focused, on, stabilizing, the, economy, by, creating, long, term, employment, opportunities, decreasing, agricultural, supply, to, drive, prices, up, and, helping, homeowners, pay, mortgages, and, stay, in, their, homes, which, also, kept, the, banks, solvent, in, a, survey, of, economic, historians, conducted, by, robert, whaples, professor, of, economics, at, wake, forest, university, anonymous, questionnaires, were, sent, to, members, of, the, economic, history, association, members, were, asked, to, disagree, agree, or, agree, with, provisos, with, the, statement, that, read, taken, as, a, whole, government, policies, of, the, new, deal, served, to, lengthen, and, deepen, the, great, depression, while, only, 6, of, economic, historians, who, worked, in, the, history, department, of, their, universities, agreed, with, the, statement, 27, of, those, that, work, in, the, economics, department, agreed, almost, an, identical, percent, of, the, two, groups, 21, and, 22, agreed, with, the, statement, with, provisos, a, conditional, stipulation, while, 74, of, those, who, worked, in, the, history, department, and, 51, in, the, economic, department, disagreed, with, the, statement, outright, from, 1933, to, 1941, the, economy, expanded, at, an, average, rate, of, 7, 7, per, year, despite, high, economic, growth, unemployment, rates, fell, slowly, john, maynard, keynes, explained, that, situation, as, an, underemployment, equilibrium, where, skeptic, business, prospects, prevent, companies, from, hiring, new, employees, it, was, seen, as, a, form, of, cyclical, unemployment, there, are, different, assumptions, as, well, according, to, richard, l, jensen, cyclical, unemployment, was, a, grave, matter, primarily, until, 1935, between, 1935, and, 1941, structural, unemployment, became, the, bigger, problem, especially, the, unions, successes, in, demanding, higher, wages, pushed, management, into, introducing, new, efficiency, oriented, hiring, standards, it, ended, inefficient, labor, such, as, child, labor, casual, unskilled, work, for, subminimum, wages, and, sweatshop, conditions, in, the, long, term, the, shift, to, efficiency, wages, led, to, high, productivity, high, wages, and, a, high, standard, of, living, but, it, necessitated, a, well, educated, well, trained, hard, working, labor, force, it, was, not, before, war, time, brought, full, employment, that, the, supply, of, unskilled, labor, that, caused, structural, unemployment, downsized, at, the, beginning, of, the, great, depression, many, economists, traditionally, argued, against, deficit, spending, the, fear, was, that, government, spending, would, crowd, out, private, investment, and, would, thus, not, have, any, effect, on, the, economy, a, proposition, known, as, the, treasury, view, but, keynesian, economics, rejected, that, view, they, argued, that, by, spending, vastly, more, money, using, fiscal, policy, the, government, could, provide, the, needed, stimulus, through, the, multiplier, effect, without, that, stimulus, business, simply, would, not, hire, more, people, especially, the, low, skilled, and, supposedly, untrainable, men, who, had, been, unemployed, for, years, and, lost, any, job, skill, they, once, had, keynes, visited, the, white, house, in, 1934, to, urge, president, roosevelt, to, increase, deficit, spending, roosevelt, afterwards, complained, he, left, a, whole, rigmarole, of, figures, he, must, be, a, mathematician, rather, than, a, political, economist, the, new, deal, tried, public, works, farm, subsidies, and, other, devices, to, reduce, unemployment, but, roosevelt, never, completely, gave, up, trying, to, balance, the, budget, between, 1933, and, 1941, the, average, federal, budget, deficit, was, 3, per, year, roosevelt, did, not, fully, utilize, deficit, spending, the, effects, of, federal, public, works, spending, were, largely, offset, by, herbert, hoover, s, large, tax, increase, in, 1932, whose, full, effects, for, the, first, time, were, felt, in, 1933, and, it, was, undercut, by, spending, cuts, especially, the, economy, act, according, to, keynesians, like, paul, krugman, the, new, deal, therefore, was, not, as, successful, in, the, short, run, as, it, was, in, the, long, run, following, the, keynesian, consensus, that, lasted, until, the, 1970s, the, traditional, view, was, that, federal, deficit, spending, associated, with, the, war, brought, full, employment, output, while, monetary, policy, was, just, aiding, the, process, in, this, view, the, new, deal, did, not, end, the, great, depression, but, halted, the, economic, collapse, and, ameliorated, the, worst, of, the, crises, more, influential, among, economists, has, been, the, monetarist, interpretation, by, milton, friedman, as, put, forth, in, a, monetary, history, of, the, united, states, which, includes, a, full, scale, monetary, history, of, what, he, calls, the, great, contraction, friedman, concentrated, on, the, failures, before, 1933, and, points, out, that, between, 1929, and, 1932, the, federal, reserve, allowed, the, money, supply, to, fall, by, a, third, which, is, seen, as, the, major, cause, that, turned, a, normal, recession, into, a, great, depression, friedman, especially, criticized, the, decisions, of, hoover, and, the, federal, reserve, not, to, save, banks, going, bankrupt, friedman, s, arguments, got, an, endorsement, from, a, surprising, source, when, fed, governor, ben, bernanke, made, this, statement, let, me, end, my, talk, by, abusing, slightly, my, status, as, an, official, representative, of, the, federal, reserve, i, would, like, to, say, to, milton, and, anna, regarding, the, great, depression, you, re, right, we, did, it, we, re, very, sorry, but, thanks, to, you, we, won, t, do, it, again, monetarists, state, that, the, banking, and, monetary, reforms, were, a, necessary, and, sufficient, response, to, the, crises, they, reject, the, approach, of, keynesian, deficit, spending, in, an, interview, in, 2000, friedman, said, you, have, to, distinguish, between, two, classes, of, new, deal, policies, one, class, of, new, deal, policies, was, reform, wage, and, price, control, the, blue, eagle, the, national, industrial, recovery, movement, i, did, not, support, those, the, other, part, of, the, new, deal, policy, was, relief, and, recovery, providing, relief, for, the, unemployed, providing, jobs, for, the, unemployed, and, motivating, the, economy, to, expand, an, expansive, monetary, policy, those, parts, of, the, new, deal, i, did, support, ben, bernanke, and, martin, parkinson, declared, in, unemployment, inflation, and, wages, in, the, american, depression, 1989, the, new, deal, is, better, characterized, as, having, cleared, the, way, for, a, natural, recovery, for, example, by, ending, deflation, and, rehabilitating, the, financial, system, rather, than, as, being, the, engine, of, recovery, itself, challenging, the, traditional, view, monetarists, and, new, keynesians, like, j, bradford, delong, lawrence, summers, and, christina, romer, argued, that, recovery, was, essentially, complete, prior, to, 1942, and, that, monetary, policy, was, the, crucial, source, of, pre, 1942, recovery, the, extraordinary, growth, in, money, supply, beginning, in, 1933, lowered, real, interest, rates, and, stimulated, investment, spending, according, to, bernanke, there, was, also, a, debt, deflation, effect, of, the, depression, which, was, clearly, offset, by, a, reflation, through, the, growth, in, money, supply, however, before, 1992, scholars, did, not, realize, that, the, new, deal, provided, for, a, huge, aggregate, demand, stimulus, through, a, de, facto, easing, of, monetary, policy, while, milton, friedman, and, anna, schwartz, argued, in, a, monetary, history, of, the, united, states, 1963, that, the, federal, reserve, system, had, made, no, attempt, to, increase, the, quantity, in, high, powered, money, and, thus, failed, to, foster, recovery, they, somehow, did, not, investigate, the, impact, of, the, monetary, policy, of, the, new, deal, in, 1992, christina, romer, explained, in, what, ended, the, great, depression, that, the, rapid, growth, in, money, supply, beginning, in, 1933, can, be, traced, back, to, a, large, unsterilized, gold, inflow, to, the, u, s, which, was, partly, due, to, political, instability, in, europe, but, to, a, larger, degree, to, the, revaluation, of, gold, through, the, gold, reserve, act, the, roosevelt, administration, had, chosen, not, to, sterilize, the, gold, inflow, precisely, because, they, hoped, that, the, growth, of, money, supply, would, stimulate, the, economy, replying, to, delong, et, al, in, the, journal, of, economic, history, j, r, vernon, argues, that, deficit, spending, leading, up, to, and, during, world, war, ii, still, played, a, large, part, in, the, overall, recovery, according, to, his, study, half, or, more, of, the, recovery, occurred, during, 1941, and, 1942, according, to, peter, temin, barry, wigmore, gauti, b, eggertsson, and, christina, romer, the, biggest, primary, impact, of, the, new, deal, on, the, economy, and, the, key, to, recovery, and, to, end, the, great, depression, was, brought, about, by, a, successful, management, of, public, expectations, the, thesis, is, based, on, the, observation, that, after, years, of, deflation, and, a, very, severe, recession, important, economic, indicators, turned, positive, just, in, march, 1933, when, roosevelt, took, office, consumer, prices, turned, from, deflation, to, mild, inflation, industrial, production, bottomed, out, in, march, 1933, investment, doubled, in, 1933, with, a, turnaround, in, march, 1933, there, were, no, monetary, forces, to, explain, that, turnaround, money, supply, was, still, falling, and, short, term, interest, rates, remained, close, to, zero, before, march, 1933, people, expected, a, further, deflation, and, recession, so, that, even, interest, rates, at, zero, did, not, stimulate, investment, however, when, roosevelt, announced, major, regime, changes, people, began, to, expect, inflation, and, an, economic, expansion, with, those, expectations, interest, rates, at, zero, began, to, stimulate, investment, just, as, they, were, expected, to, do, roosevelt, s, fiscal, and, monetary, policy, regime, change, helped, to, make, his, policy, objectives, credible, the, expectation, of, higher, future, income, and, higher, future, inflation, stimulated, demand, and, investments, the, analysis, suggests, that, the, elimination, of, the, policy, dogmas, of, the, gold, standard, a, balanced, budget, in, times, of, crises, and, small, government, led, endogenously, to, a, large, shift, in, expectation, that, accounts, for, about, 70, 80, percent, of, the, recovery, of, output, and, prices, from, 1933, to, 1937, if, the, regime, change, had, not, happened, and, the, hoover, policy, had, continued, the, economy, would, have, continued, its, free, fall, in, 1933, and, output, would, have, been, 30, percent, lower, in, 1937, than, in, 1933, followers, of, the, real, business, cycle, theory, believe, that, the, new, deal, caused, the, depression, to, persist, longer, than, it, would, otherwise, have, harold, l, cole, and, lee, e, ohanian, say, roosevelt, s, policies, prolonged, the, depression, by, seven, years, according, to, their, study, the, new, deal, labor, and, industrial, policies, did, not, lift, the, economy, out, of, the, depression, but, that, the, new, deal, policies, are, an, important, contributing, factor, to, the, persistence, of, the, great, depression, they, claim, that, the, new, deal, cartelization, policies, are, a, key, factor, behind, the, weak, recovery, they, say, that, the, abandonment, of, these, policies, coincided, with, the, strong, economic, recovery, of, the, 1940s, the, study, by, cole, and, ohanian, is, based, on, a, real, business, cycle, theory, model, laurence, seidman, noted, that, according, to, the, assumptions, of, cole, and, ohanian, the, labor, market, clears, instantaneously, which, leads, to, the, incredible, conclusion, that, the, surge, in, unemployment, between, 1929, and, 1932, before, the, new, deal, was, in, their, opinion, both, optimal, and, solely, based, on, voluntary, unemployment, additionally, cole, and, ohanian, s, argument, does, not, count, workers, employed, through, new, deal, programs, such, programs, built, or, renovated, 2, 500, hospitals, 45, 000, schools, 13, 000, parks, and, playgrounds, 7, 800, bridges, 700, 000, miles, 1, 100, 000, km, of, roads, 1, 000, airfields, and, employed, 50, 000, teachers, through, programs, that, rebuilt, the, country, s, entire, rural, school, system, the, economic, reforms, were, mainly, intended, to, rescue, the, capitalist, system, by, providing, a, more, rational, framework, in, which, it, could, operate, the, banking, system, was, made, less, vulnerable, the, regulation, of, the, stock, market, and, the, prevention, of, some, corporate, abuses, relating, to, the, sale, of, securities, and, corporate, reporting, addressed, the, worst, excesses, roosevelt, allowed, trade, unions, to, take, their, place, in, labor, relations, and, created, the, triangular, partnership, between, employers, employees, and, government, david, m, kennedy, wrote, the, achievements, of, the, new, deal, years, surely, played, a, role, in, determining, the, degree, and, the, duration, of, the, postwar, prosperity, paul, krugman, stated, that, the, institutions, built, by, the, new, deal, remain, the, bedrock, of, the, united, states, economic, stability, against, the, background, of, the, 2007, 2008, financial, crisis, he, explained, that, conditions, would, have, been, much, worse, if, the, new, deals, federal, deposit, insurance, corporation, had, not, insured, most, bank, deposits, and, older, americans, would, have, felt, much, more, insecure, without, social, security, economist, milton, friedman, after, 1960, attacked, social, security, from, a, free, market, view, stating, that, it, had, created, welfare, dependency, the, new, deal, banking, reform, has, weakened, since, the, 1980s, the, repeal, of, the, glass, steagall, act, in, 1999, allowed, the, shadow, banking, system, to, grow, rapidly, since, it, was, neither, regulated, nor, covered, by, a, financial, safety, net, the, shadow, banking, system, was, central, to, the, 2007, 2008, financial, crisis, and, the, subsequent, great, recession, though, it, is, essentially, consensus, among, historians, and, academics, that, the, new, deal, brought, about, a, large, increase, in, the, power, of, the, federal, government, there, has, been, some, scholarly, debate, concerning, the, results, of, this, federal, expansion, historians, like, arthur, m, schlesinger, and, james, t, patterson, have, argued, that, the, augmentation, of, the, federal, government, exacerbated, tensions, between, the, federal, and, state, governments, however, contemporaries, such, as, ira, katznelson, have, suggested, that, due, to, certain, conditions, on, the, allocation, of, federal, funds, namely, that, the, individual, states, get, to, control, them, the, federal, government, managed, to, avoid, any, tension, with, states, over, their, rights, this, is, a, prominent, debate, concerning, the, historiography, of, federalism, in, the, united, states, and, as, schlesinger, and, patterson, have, observed, the, new, deal, marked, an, era, when, the, federal, state, power, balance, shifted, further, in, favor, of, the, federal, government, which, heightened, tensions, between, the, two, levels, of, government, in, the, united, states, ira, katznelson, has, argued, that, although, the, federal, government, expanded, its, power, and, began, providing, welfare, benefits, on, a, scale, previously, unknown, in, the, united, states, it, often, allowed, individual, states, to, control, the, allocation, of, the, funds, provided, for, such, welfare, this, meant, that, the, states, controlled, who, had, access, to, these, funds, which, in, turn, meant, many, southern, states, were, able, to, racially, segregate, or, in, some, cases, like, a, number, of, counties, in, georgia, completely, exclude, african, americans, the, allocation, of, federal, funds, this, enabled, these, states, to, continue, to, relatively, exercise, their, rights, and, also, to, preserve, the, institutionalization, of, the, racist, order, of, their, societies, though, katznelson, has, conceded, that, the, expansion, of, the, federal, government, had, the, potential, to, lead, to, federal, state, tension, he, has, argued, it, was, avoided, as, these, states, managed, to, retain, some, control, as, katznelson, has, observed, they, had, to, manage, the, strain, that, potentially, might, be, placed, on, local, practices, by, investing, authority, in, federal, bureaucracies, to, guard, against, this, outcome, the, key, mechanism, deployed, was, a, separation, of, the, source, of, funding, from, decisions, about, how, to, spend, the, new, monies, however, schlesinger, has, disputed, katznelson, s, claim, and, has, argued, that, the, increase, in, the, power, of, the, federal, government, was, perceived, to, come, at, the, cost, of, states, rights, thereby, aggravating, state, governments, which, exacerbated, federal, state, tensions, schlesinger, has, utilized, quotes, from, the, time, to, highlight, this, point, and, has, observed, the, actions, of, the, new, deal, mills, said, abolish, the, sovereignty, of, the, states, they, make, of, a, government, of, limited, powers, one, of, unlimited, authority, over, the, lives, of, us, all, moreover, schlesinger, has, argued, that, this, federal, state, tension, was, not, a, one, way, street, and, that, the, federal, government, became, just, as, aggravated, with, the, state, governments, as, they, did, with, it, state, governments, were, often, guilty, of, inhibiting, or, delaying, federal, policies, whether, through, intentional, methods, like, sabotage, or, unintentional, ones, like, simple, administrative, overload, either, way, these, problems, aggravated, the, federal, government, and, thus, heightened, federal, state, tensions, schlesinger, has, also, noted, students, of, public, administration, have, never, taken, sufficient, account, of, the, capacity, of, lower, levels, of, government, to, sabotage, or, defy, even, a, masterful, president, james, t, patterson, has, reiterated, this, argument, though, he, observes, that, this, increased, tension, can, be, accounted, for, not, just, from, a, political, perspective, but, from, an, economic, one, too, patterson, has, argued, that, the, tension, between, the, federal, and, state, governments, at, least, partly, also, resulted, from, the, economic, strain, under, which, the, states, had, been, put, by, the, federal, government, s, various, policies, and, agencies, some, states, were, either, simply, unable, to, cope, with, the, federal, government, s, demand, and, thus, refused, to, work, with, them, or, admonished, the, economic, restraints, and, actively, decided, to, sabotage, federal, policies, this, was, demonstrated, patterson, has, noted, with, the, handling, of, federal, relief, money, by, ohio, governor, martin, l, davey, the, case, in, ohio, became, so, detrimental, to, the, federal, government, that, harry, hopkins, supervisor, of, the, federal, emergency, relief, administration, had, to, federalize, ohio, relief, although, this, argument, differs, somewhat, from, schlesinger, s, the, source, of, federal, state, tension, remained, the, growth, of, the, federal, government, as, patterson, has, asserted, though, the, record, of, the, fera, was, remarkably, good, almost, revolutionary, in, these, respects, it, was, inevitable, given, the, financial, requirements, imposed, on, deficit, ridden, states, that, friction, would, develop, between, governors, and, federal, officials, in, this, dispute, it, can, be, inferred, that, katznelson, and, schlesinger, and, patterson, have, only, disagreed, on, their, inference, of, the, historical, evidence, while, both, parties, have, agreed, that, the, federal, government, expanded, and, even, that, states, had, a, degree, of, control, over, the, allocation, of, federal, funds, they, have, disputed, the, consequences, of, these, claims, katznelson, has, asserted, that, it, created, mutual, acquiescence, between, the, levels, of, government, while, schlesinger, and, patterson, have, suggested, that, it, provoked, contempt, for, the, state, governments, on, the, part, of, the, federal, government, and, vice, versa, thus, exacerbating, their, relations, in, short, irrespective, of, the, interpretation, this, era, marked, an, important, time, in, the, historiography, of, federalism, and, also, nevertheless, provided, some, narrative, on, the, legacy, of, federal, state, relations, worldwide, the, great, depression, had, the, most, profound, impact, in, germany, and, the, united, states, in, both, countries, the, pressure, to, reform, and, the, perception, of, the, economic, crisis, were, strikingly, similar, when, hitler, came, to, power, he, was, faced, with, exactly, the, same, task, that, faced, roosevelt, overcoming, mass, unemployment, and, the, global, depression, the, political, responses, to, the, crises, were, essentially, different, while, american, democracy, remained, strong, germany, replaced, democracy, with, fascism, a, nazi, dictatorship, the, initial, perception, of, the, new, deal, was, mixed, on, the, one, hand, the, eyes, of, the, world, were, upon, the, united, states, because, many, american, and, european, democrats, saw, in, roosevelt, s, reform, program, a, positive, counterweight, to, the, seductive, powers, of, the, two, great, alternative, systems, communism, and, fascism, as, the, historian, isaiah, berlin, wrote, in, 1955, the, only, light, in, the, darkness, was, the, administration, of, mr, roosevelt, and, the, new, deal, in, the, united, states, by, contrast, enemies, of, the, new, deal, sometimes, called, it, fascist, but, they, meant, very, different, things, communists, denounced, the, new, deal, in, 1933, and, 1934, as, fascist, in, the, sense, that, it, was, under, the, control, of, big, business, they, dropped, that, line, of, thought, when, stalin, switched, to, the, popular, front, plan, of, cooperation, with, progressives, in, 1934, roosevelt, defended, himself, against, those, critics, in, a, fireside, chat, will, try, to, give, you, new, and, strange, names, for, what, we, are, doing, sometimes, they, will, call, it, fascism, sometimes, communism, sometimes, regimentation, sometimes, socialism, but, in, so, doing, they, are, trying, to, make, very, complex, and, theoretical, something, that, is, really, very, simple, and, very, practical, plausible, self, seekers, and, theoretical, die, hards, will, tell, you, of, the, loss, of, individual, liberty, answer, this, question, out, of, the, facts, of, your, own, life, have, you, lost, any, of, your, rights, or, liberty, or, constitutional, freedom, of, action, and, choice, after, 1945, only, few, observers, continued, to, see, similarities, and, later, on, some, scholars, such, as, kiran, klaus, patel, heinrich, august, winkler, and, john, garraty, came, to, the, conclusion, that, comparisons, of, the, alternative, systems, do, not, have, to, end, in, an, apology, for, nazism, since, comparisons, rely, on, the, examination, of, both, similarities, and, differences, their, preliminary, studies, on, the, origins, of, the, fascist, dictatorships, and, the, american, reformed, democracy, came, to, the, conclusion, that, besides, essential, differences, the, crises, led, to, a, limited, degree, of, convergence, on, the, level, of, economic, and, social, policy, the, most, important, cause, was, the, growth, of, state, interventionism, since, in, the, face, of, the, catastrophic, economic, situation, both, societies, no, longer, counted, on, the, power, of, the, market, to, heal, itself, john, garraty, wrote, that, the, national, recovery, administration, nra, was, based, on, economic, experiments, in, nazi, germany, and, fascist, italy, without, establishing, a, totalitarian, dictatorship, contrary, to, that, historians, such, as, hawley, have, examined, the, origins, of, the, nra, in, detail, showing, the, main, inspiration, came, from, senators, hugo, black, and, robert, f, wagner, and, from, american, business, leaders, such, as, the, chamber, of, commerce, the, model, for, the, nra, was, woodrow, wilson, s, war, industries, board, in, which, johnson, had, been, involved, too, historians, argue, that, direct, comparisons, between, fascism, and, new, deal, are, invalid, since, there, is, no, distinctive, form, of, fascist, economic, organization, gerald, feldman, wrote, that, fascism, has, not, contributed, anything, to, economic, thought, and, had, no, original, vision, of, a, new, economic, order, replacing, capitalism, his, argument, correlates, with, mason, s, that, economic, factors, alone, are, an, insufficient, approach, to, understand, fascism, and, that, decisions, taken, by, fascists, in, power, cannot, be, explained, within, a, logical, economic, framework, in, economic, terms, both, ideas, were, within, the, general, tendency, of, the, 1930s, to, intervene, in, the, free, market, capitalist, economy, at, the, price, of, its, laissez, faire, character, to, protect, the, capitalist, structure, endangered, by, endogenous, crises, tendencies, and, processes, of, impaired, self, regulation, stanley, payne, a, historian, of, fascism, examined, possible, fascist, influences, in, the, united, states, by, looking, at, the, kkk, and, its, offshoots, and, movements, led, by, father, coughlin, and, huey, long, he, concluded, the, various, populist, nativist, and, rightist, movements, in, the, united, states, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, fell, distinctly, short, of, fascism, according, to, kevin, passmore, lecturer, in, history, at, cardiff, university, the, failure, of, fascism, in, the, united, states, was, due, to, the, social, policies, of, the, new, deal, that, channelled, anti, establishment, populism, into, the, left, rather, than, the, extreme, right, the, new, deal, was, generally, held, in, very, high, regard, in, scholarship, and, textbooks, that, changed, in, the, 1960s, when, new, left, historians, began, a, revisionist, critique, calling, the, new, deal, a, band, aid, for, a, patient, that, needed, radical, surgery, to, reform, capitalism, put, private, property, in, its, place, and, lift, up, workers, women, and, minorities, the, new, left, believed, in, participatory, democracy, and, therefore, rejected, the, autocratic, machine, politics, typical, of, the, big, city, democratic, organizations, in, a, 1968, essay, barton, j, bernstein, compiled, a, chronicle, of, missed, opportunities, and, inadequate, responses, to, problems, the, new, deal, may, have, saved, capitalism, from, itself, bernstein, charged, but, it, had, failed, to, help, and, in, many, cases, actually, harmed, those, groups, most, in, need, of, assistance, in, the, new, deal, 1967, paul, k, conkin, similarly, chastised, the, government, of, the, 1930s, for, its, weak, policies, toward, marginal, farmers, for, its, failure, to, institute, sufficiently, progressive, tax, reform, and, its, excessive, generosity, toward, select, business, interests, in, 1966, howard, zinn, criticized, the, new, deal, for, working, actively, to, actually, preserve, the, worst, evils, of, capitalism, by, the, 1970s, progressive, historians, were, responding, with, a, defense, of, the, new, deal, based, on, numerous, local, and, microscopic, studies, praise, increasingly, focused, on, eleanor, roosevelt, seen, as, a, more, appropriate, crusading, reformer, than, her, husband, in, a, series, of, articles, political, sociologist, theda, skocpol, has, emphasized, the, issue, of, state, capacity, as, an, often, crippling, constraint, ambitious, reform, ideas, often, failed, she, argued, because, of, the, absence, of, a, government, bureaucracy, with, significant, strength, and, expertise, to, administer, them, other, more, recent, works, have, stressed, the, political, constraints, that, the, new, deal, encountered, conservative, skepticism, about, the, efficacy, of, government, was, strong, both, in, congress, and, among, many, citizens, thus, some, scholars, have, stressed, that, the, new, deal, was, not, just, a, product, of, its, progressive, backers, but, also, a, product, of, the, pressures, of, its, conservative, opponents, some, hard, right, critics, in, the, 1930s, claimed, that, roosevelt, was, state, socialist, or, communist, including, charles, coughlin, elizabeth, dilling, and, gerald, l, k, smith, the, accusations, generally, targeted, the, new, deal, these, conspiracy, theories, were, grouped, as, the, red, web, or, roosevelt, red, record, based, significantly, on, propaganda, books, by, dilling, there, was, significant, overlap, between, these, red, baiting, accusations, against, roosevelt, and, the, isolationist, america, first, committee, roosevelt, was, concerned, enough, about, the, accusations, that, in, a, september, 29, 1936, speech, in, syracuse, roosevelt, officially, condemned, communism, other, accusations, of, socialism, or, claimed, communism, came, from, republican, representative, robert, f, rich, and, senators, simeon, d, fess, and, thomas, d, schall, the, accusations, of, communism, were, widespread, enough, to, misdirect,
