the, confederate, states, of, america, csa, commonly, referred, to, as, the, confederate, states, c, s, the, confederacy, or, the, south, was, an, unrecognized, breakaway, republic, in, the, southern, united, states, that, existed, from, february, 8, 1861, to, may, 9, 1865, the, confederacy, was, composed, of, eleven, u, s, states, that, declared, secession, and, warred, against, the, united, states, during, the, american, civil, war, the, states, were, south, carolina, mississippi, florida, alabama, georgia, louisiana, texas, virginia, arkansas, tennessee, and, north, carolina, when, abraham, lincoln, was, elected, president, of, the, united, states, in, 1860, the, southern, states, were, convinced, their, slavery, based, plantation, economy, was, threatened, and, began, to, secede, from, the, united, states, the, confederacy, was, formed, on, february, 8, 1861, by, south, carolina, mississippi, florida, alabama, georgia, louisiana, and, texas, these, states, seceded, in, the, first, of, two, waves, of, secession, they, adopted, a, new, constitution, establishing, a, confederation, government, of, sovereign, and, independent, states, some, northerners, reacted, by, saying, let, the, confederacy, go, in, peace, while, some, southerners, wanted, to, maintain, their, loyalty, to, the, union, the, federal, government, in, washington, d, c, and, states, under, its, control, were, known, as, the, union, the, civil, war, began, on, april, 12, 1861, when, the, south, carolina, militia, attacked, fort, sumter, four, slave, states, of, the, upper, south, virginia, arkansas, tennessee, and, north, carolina, then, seceded, in, the, second, wave, of, secession, and, joined, the, confederacy, on, february, 22, 1862, confederate, states, army, leaders, re, installed, a, federal, government, in, richmond, virginia, and, enacted, the, first, confederate, draft, on, april, 16, 1862, by, 1865, the, confederacy, s, federal, government, dissolved, into, chaos, and, the, confederate, states, congress, adjourned, effectively, ceasing, to, exist, as, a, legislative, body, on, march, 18, after, four, years, of, heavy, fighting, nearly, all, confederate, land, and, naval, forces, either, surrendered, or, otherwise, ceased, hostilities, by, may, 1865, the, most, significant, capitulation, was, confederate, general, robert, e, lee, s, surrender, on, april, 9, after, which, any, doubt, about, the, war, s, outcome, or, the, confederacy, s, survival, was, extinguished, confederate, president, davis, s, administration, declared, the, confederacy, dissolved, on, may, 5, after, the, war, during, the, reconstruction, era, the, confederate, states, were, readmitted, to, the, congress, after, each, ratified, the, 13th, amendment, to, the, u, s, constitution, outlawing, slavery, lost, cause, mythology, an, idealized, view, of, the, confederacy, valiantly, fighting, for, a, just, cause, emerged, in, the, decades, after, the, war, among, former, confederate, generals, and, politicians, and, in, organizations, such, as, the, united, daughters, of, the, confederacy, and, the, sons, of, confederate, veterans, intense, periods, of, lost, cause, activity, developed, around, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, and, during, the, civil, rights, movement, of, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, in, reaction, to, growing, support, for, racial, equality, advocates, sought, to, ensure, future, generations, of, southern, whites, would, continue, to, support, white, supremacist, policies, such, as, the, jim, crow, laws, through, activities, such, as, building, confederate, monuments, and, influencing, the, authors, of, textbooks, the, modern, display, of, the, confederate, battle, flag, primarily, started, during, the, 1948, presidential, election, when, the, battle, flag, was, used, by, the, dixiecrats, during, the, civil, rights, movement, racial, segregationists, used, it, for, demonstrations, a, consensus, of, historians, who, address, the, origins, of, the, american, civil, war, agree, that, the, preservation, of, the, institution, of, slavery, was, the, principal, aim, of, the, eleven, southern, states, seven, states, before, the, onset, of, the, war, and, four, states, after, the, onset, that, declared, their, secession, from, the, united, states, the, union, and, united, to, form, the, confederate, states, of, america, known, as, the, confederacy, however, while, historians, in, the, 21st, century, agree, on, the, centrality, of, slavery, in, the, conflict, they, disagree, sharply, on, which, aspects, of, this, conflict, ideological, economic, political, or, social, were, most, important, and, on, the, north, s, reasons, for, refusing, to, allow, the, southern, states, to, secede, proponents, of, the, pseudo, historical, lost, cause, ideology, have, denied, that, slavery, was, the, principal, cause, of, the, secession, a, view, that, has, been, disproven, by, the, overwhelming, historical, evidence, against, it, notably, some, of, the, seceding, states, own, secession, documents, the, principal, political, battle, leading, to, southern, secession, was, over, whether, slavery, would, be, permitted, to, expand, into, the, western, territories, destined, to, become, states, initially, congress, had, admitted, new, states, into, the, union, in, pairs, one, slave, and, one, free, this, had, kept, a, sectional, balance, in, the, senate, but, not, in, the, house, of, representatives, as, free, states, outstripped, slave, states, in, numbers, of, eligible, voters, thus, at, mid, 19th, century, the, free, versus, slave, status, of, the, new, territories, was, a, critical, issue, both, for, the, north, where, anti, slavery, sentiment, had, grown, and, for, the, south, where, the, fear, of, slavery, s, abolition, had, grown, another, factor, leading, to, secession, and, the, formation, of, the, confederacy, was, the, development, of, white, southern, nationalism, in, the, preceding, decades, the, primary, reason, for, the, north, to, reject, secession, was, to, preserve, the, union, a, cause, based, on, american, nationalism, abraham, lincoln, won, the, 1860, presidential, election, his, victory, triggered, declarations, of, secession, by, seven, slave, states, of, the, deep, south, all, of, whose, riverfront, or, coastal, economies, were, based, on, cotton, that, was, cultivated, by, slave, labor, they, formed, the, confederate, states, of, america, after, lincoln, was, elected, in, november, 1860, but, before, he, took, office, in, march, 1861, nationalists, in, the, north, and, unionists, in, the, south, refused, to, accept, the, declarations, of, secession, no, foreign, government, ever, recognized, the, confederacy, the, u, s, government, under, president, james, buchanan, refused, to, relinquish, its, forts, that, were, in, territory, claimed, by, the, confederacy, the, war, itself, began, on, april, 12, 1861, when, confederate, forces, bombarded, the, union, s, fort, sumter, in, the, harbor, of, charleston, south, carolina, background, factors, in, the, run, up, to, the, civil, war, were, partisan, politics, abolitionism, nullification, versus, secession, southern, and, northern, nationalism, expansionism, economics, and, modernization, in, the, antebellum, period, as, a, panel, of, historians, emphasized, in, 2011, while, slavery, and, its, various, and, multifaceted, discontents, were, the, primary, cause, of, disunion, it, was, disunion, itself, that, sparked, the, war, historian, david, m, potter, wrote, the, problem, for, americans, who, in, the, age, of, lincoln, wanted, slaves, to, be, free, was, not, simply, that, southerners, wanted, the, opposite, but, that, they, themselves, cherished, a, conflicting, value, they, wanted, the, constitution, which, protected, slavery, to, be, honored, and, the, union, which, was, a, fellowship, with, slaveholders, to, be, preserved, thus, they, were, committed, to, values, that, could, not, logically, be, reconciled, the, first, secession, state, conventions, from, the, deep, south, sent, representatives, to, the, montgomery, convention, in, alabama, on, february, 4, 1861, a, provisional, government, was, established, and, a, representative, congress, met, for, the, confederate, states, of, america, the, new, provisional, confederate, president, jefferson, davis, issued, a, call, for, 100, 000, men, from, the, states, militias, to, defend, the, newly, formed, confederacy, all, federal, property, was, seized, including, gold, bullion, and, coining, dies, at, the, u, s, mints, in, charlotte, north, carolina, dahlonega, georgia, and, new, orleans, the, confederate, capital, was, moved, from, montgomery, to, richmond, virginia, in, may, 1861, on, february, 22, 1862, davis, was, inaugurated, as, president, with, a, term, of, six, years, the, confederate, administration, pursued, a, policy, of, national, territorial, integrity, continuing, earlier, state, efforts, in, 1860, 61, to, remove, u, s, government, presence, this, included, taking, possession, of, u, s, courts, custom, houses, post, offices, and, most, notably, arsenals, and, forts, after, the, confederate, attack, and, capture, of, fort, sumter, in, april, 1861, lincoln, called, up, 75, 000, of, the, states, militia, to, muster, under, his, command, the, stated, purpose, was, to, re, occupy, u, s, properties, throughout, the, south, as, the, u, s, congress, had, not, authorized, their, abandonment, the, resistance, at, fort, sumter, signaled, his, change, of, policy, from, that, of, the, buchanan, administration, lincoln, s, response, ignited, a, firestorm, of, emotion, the, people, of, both, north, and, south, demanded, war, with, soldiers, rushing, to, their, colors, in, the, hundreds, of, thousands, secessionists, argued, that, the, united, states, constitution, was, a, contract, among, sovereign, states, that, could, be, abandoned, without, consultation, and, each, state, had, a, right, to, secede, after, intense, debates, and, statewide, votes, seven, deep, south, cotton, states, passed, secession, ordinances, by, february, 1861, while, secession, efforts, failed, in, the, other, eight, slave, states, the, confederacy, expanded, in, may, july, 1861, with, virginia, arkansas, tennessee, north, carolina, and, disintegrated, in, april, may, 1865, it, was, formed, by, delegations, from, seven, slave, states, of, the, lower, south, that, had, proclaimed, their, secession, after, the, fighting, began, in, april, four, additional, slave, states, seceded, and, were, admitted, later, two, slave, states, missouri, and, kentucky, and, two, territories, were, given, seats, in, the, confederate, congress, its, establishment, flowed, from, and, deepened, southern, nationalism, which, prepared, men, to, fight, for, the, southern, cause, this, cause, included, support, for, states, rights, tariff, policy, and, internal, improvements, but, above, all, cultural, and, financial, dependence, on, the, south, s, slavery, based, economy, the, convergence, of, race, and, slavery, politics, and, economics, raised, south, related, policy, questions, to, the, status, of, moral, questions, over, way, of, life, merging, love, of, things, southern, and, hatred, of, things, northern, as, the, war, approached, political, parties, split, and, national, churches, and, interstate, families, divided, along, sectional, lines, according, to, historian, john, m, coski, the, statesmen, who, led, the, secession, movement, were, unashamed, to, explicitly, cite, the, defense, of, slavery, as, their, prime, motive, acknowledging, the, centrality, of, slavery, to, the, confederacy, is, essential, for, understanding, the, confederate, southern, democrats, had, chosen, john, breckinridge, as, their, candidate, during, the, 1860, presidential, election, but, in, no, southern, state, was, support, for, him, unanimous, as, they, recorded, at, least, some, popular, vote, for, at, least, one, of, the, other, three, candidates, abraham, lincoln, stephen, a, douglas, and, john, bell, support, for, these, three, collectively, ranged, from, significant, to, outright, majority, running, from, 25, in, texas, to, 81, in, missouri, there, were, minority, views, everywhere, especially, in, the, upland, and, plateau, areas, of, the, south, particularly, concentrated, in, western, virginia, and, eastern, tennessee, the, first, six, signatory, states, establishing, the, confederacy, counted, about, one, fourth, its, population, they, voted, 43, for, pro, union, candidates, the, four, states, which, entered, after, the, attack, on, fort, sumter, held, almost, half, the, population, of, the, confederacy, and, voted, 53, for, pro, union, candidates, the, three, big, turnout, states, voted, extremes, texas, with, 5, of, the, population, voted, 20, for, pro, union, candidates, kentucky, and, missouri, with, one, fourth, the, confederate, population, voted, 68, for, pro, union, following, south, carolina, s, unanimous, 1860, secession, vote, no, other, southern, states, considered, the, question, until, 1861, when, they, did, none, had, a, unanimous, vote, all, had, residents, who, cast, significant, numbers, of, unionist, votes, voting, to, remain, in, the, union, did, not, necessarily, mean, individuals, were, sympathizers, with, the, north, once, fighting, began, many, who, voted, to, remain, in, the, union, accepted, the, majority, decision, and, supported, the, confederacy, many, writers, have, evaluated, the, war, as, an, american, tragedy, a, brothers, war, pitting, brother, against, brother, father, against, son, kin, against, kin, of, every, degree, initially, some, secessionists, hoped, for, a, peaceful, departure, moderates, in, the, confederate, constitutional, convention, included, a, provision, against, importation, of, slaves, from, africa, to, appeal, to, the, upper, south, non, slave, states, might, join, but, the, radicals, secured, a, two, thirds, requirement, in, both, houses, of, congress, to, accept, them, seven, states, declared, their, secession, from, the, united, states, before, lincoln, took, office, on, march, 4, 1861, after, the, confederate, attack, on, fort, sumter, april, 12, 1861, and, lincoln, s, subsequent, call, for, troops, four, more, states, declared, their, secession, kentucky, declared, neutrality, but, after, confederate, troops, moved, in, the, state, legislature, asked, for, union, troops, to, drive, them, out, delegates, from, 68, kentucky, counties, were, sent, to, the, russellville, convention, that, signed, an, ordinance, of, secession, kentucky, was, admitted, into, the, confederacy, on, december, 10, 1861, with, bowling, green, as, its, first, capital, early, in, the, war, the, confederacy, controlled, more, than, half, of, kentucky, but, largely, lost, control, in, 1862, the, splinter, confederate, government, of, kentucky, relocated, to, accompany, western, confederate, armies, and, never, controlled, the, state, population, after, 1862, by, the, end, of, the, war, 90, 000, kentuckians, had, fought, for, the, union, compared, to, 35, 000, for, the, confederacy, in, missouri, a, constitutional, convention, was, approved, and, delegates, elected, the, convention, rejected, secession, 89, 1, on, march, 19, 1861, the, governor, maneuvered, to, take, control, of, the, st, louis, arsenal, and, restrict, federal, movements, this, led, to, a, confrontation, and, in, june, federal, forces, drove, him, and, the, general, assembly, from, jefferson, city, the, executive, committee, of, the, convention, called, the, members, together, in, july, and, declared, the, state, offices, vacant, and, appointed, a, unionist, interim, state, government, the, exiled, governor, called, a, rump, session, of, the, former, general, assembly, together, in, neosho, and, on, october, 31, 1861, it, passed, an, ordinance, of, secession, the, confederate, state, government, was, unable, to, control, substantial, parts, of, missouri, territory, effectively, only, controlling, southern, missouri, early, in, the, war, it, had, its, capital, at, neosho, then, cassville, before, being, driven, out, of, the, state, for, the, remainder, of, the, war, it, operated, as, a, government, in, exile, at, marshall, texas, not, having, seceded, neither, kentucky, nor, missouri, was, declared, in, rebellion, in, lincoln, s, emancipation, proclamation, the, confederacy, recognized, the, pro, confederate, claimants, in, kentucky, december, 10, 1861, and, missouri, november, 28, 1861, and, laid, claim, to, those, states, granting, them, congressional, representation, and, adding, two, stars, to, the, confederate, flag, voting, for, the, representatives, was, mostly, done, by, confederate, soldiers, from, kentucky, and, missouri, some, southern, unionists, blamed, lincoln, s, call, for, troops, as, the, precipitating, event, for, the, second, wave, of, secessions, historian, james, mcpherson, argues, such, claims, have, a, self, serving, quality, and, regards, them, as, misleading, as, the, telegraph, chattered, reports, of, the, attack, on, sumter, april, 12, and, its, surrender, next, day, huge, crowds, poured, into, the, streets, of, richmond, raleigh, nashville, and, other, upper, south, cities, to, celebrate, this, victory, over, the, yankees, these, crowds, waved, confederate, flags, and, cheered, the, glorious, cause, of, southern, independence, they, demanded, that, their, own, states, join, the, cause, scores, of, demonstrations, took, place, from, april, 12, to, 14, before, lincoln, issued, his, call, for, troops, many, conditional, unionists, were, swept, along, by, this, powerful, tide, of, southern, nationalism, others, were, cowed, into, silence, historian, daniel, w, crofts, disagrees, with, mcpherson, the, bombardment, of, fort, sumter, by, itself, did, not, destroy, unionist, majorities, in, the, upper, south, because, only, three, days, elapsed, before, lincoln, issued, the, proclamation, the, two, events, viewed, retrospectively, appear, almost, simultaneous, nevertheless, close, examination, of, contemporary, evidence, shows, that, the, proclamation, had, a, far, more, decisive, impact, many, concluded, that, lincoln, had, deliberately, chosen, to, drive, off, all, the, slave, states, in, order, to, make, war, on, them, and, annihilate, slavery, the, order, of, secession, resolutions, and, dates, are, in, virginia, the, populous, counties, along, the, ohio, and, pennsylvania, borders, rejected, the, confederacy, unionists, held, a, convention, in, wheeling, in, june, 1861, establishing, a, restored, government, with, a, rump, legislature, but, sentiment, in, the, region, remained, deeply, divided, in, the, 50, counties, that, would, make, up, the, state, of, west, virginia, voters, from, 24, counties, had, voted, for, disunion, in, virginia, s, may, 23, referendum, on, the, ordinance, of, secession, in, the, 1860, election, constitutional, democrat, breckenridge, had, outpolled, constitutional, unionist, bell, in, the, 50, counties, by, 1, 900, votes, 44, to, 42, the, counties, simultaneously, supplied, over, 20, 000, soldiers, to, each, side, of, the, conflict, representatives, for, most, counties, were, seated, in, both, state, legislatures, at, wheeling, and, at, richmond, for, the, duration, of, the, war, attempts, to, secede, from, the, confederacy, by, counties, in, east, tennessee, were, checked, by, martial, law, although, slaveholding, delaware, and, maryland, did, not, secede, citizens, exhibited, divided, loyalties, regiments, of, marylanders, fought, in, lee, s, army, of, northern, virginia, overall, 24, 000, men, from, maryland, joined, confederate, forces, compared, to, 63, 000, who, joined, union, forces, delaware, never, produced, a, full, regiment, for, the, confederacy, but, neither, did, it, emancipate, slaves, as, did, missouri, and, west, virginia, district, of, columbia, citizens, made, no, attempts, to, secede, and,

stephens, and, others, to, encourage, other, border, states, to, follow, virginia, into, the, confederacy, in, the, political, moment, it, was, a, show, of, defiance, and, strength, the, war, for, southern, independence, was, surely, to, be, fought, in, virginia, but, it, also, had, the, largest, southern, military, aged, white, population, with, infrastructure, resources, and, supplies, the, davis, administration, s, policy, was, that, it, must, be, held, at, all, hazards, the, naming, of, richmond, as, the, new, capital, took, place, on, may, 30, 1861, and, the, last, two, sessions, of, the, provisional, congress, were, held, there, as, war, dragged, on, richmond, became, crowded, with, training, and, transfers, logistics, and, hospitals, prices, rose, dramatically, despite, government, efforts, at, price, regulation, a, movement, in, congress, argued, for, moving, the, capital, from, richmond, at, the, approach, of, federal, armies, in, mid, 1862, the, government, s, archives, were, readied, for, removal, as, the, wilderness, campaign, progressed, congress, authorized, davis, to, remove, the, executive, department, and, call, congress, to, session, elsewhere, in, 1864, and, again, in, 1865, shortly, before, the, end, of, the, war, the, confederate, government, evacuated, richmond, planning, to, relocate, further, south, little, came, of, these, plans, before, lee, s, surrender, davis, and, most, of, his, cabinet, fled, to, danville, virginia, which, served, as, their, headquarters, for, eight, days, during, its, four, years, the, confederacy, asserted, its, independence, and, appointed, dozens, of, diplomatic, agents, abroad, none, were, recognized, by, a, foreign, government, the, us, government, regarded, the, southern, states, as, being, in, rebellion, or, insurrection, and, so, refused, any, formal, recognition, of, their, status, the, us, government, never, declared, war, on, those, kindred, and, countrymen, in, the, confederacy, but, conducted, its, military, efforts, beginning, with, a, presidential, proclamation, issued, april, 15, 1861, it, called, for, troops, to, recapture, forts, and, suppress, what, lincoln, later, called, an, insurrection, and, rebellion, mid, war, parleys, between, the, two, sides, occurred, without, formal, political, recognition, though, the, laws, of, war, predominantly, governed, military, relationships, on, both, sides, of, uniformed, conflict, once, war, with, the, united, states, began, the, confederacy, pinned, its, hopes, for, survival, on, military, intervention, by, the, uk, or, france, the, confederate, government, sent, james, m, mason, to, london, and, john, slidell, to, paris, on, their, way, in, 1861, the, u, s, navy, intercepted, their, ship, the, trent, and, took,

historians, judge, their, diplomacy, as, poor, neither, secured, diplomatic, recognition, for, the, confederacy, much, less, military, assistance, the, confederates, who, had, believed, that, cotton,

unsuccessfully, to, convince, palmerston, to, intervene, by, september, 1862, the, union, victory, at, the, battle, of, antietam, lincoln, s, preliminary, emancipation, proclamation, and, abolitionist, opposition, in, britain, put, an, end, to, these, possibilities, the, cost, to, britain, of, a, war, with, the, u, s, would, have, been, high, the, immediate, loss, of, american, grain,

intervention, for, humanitarian, reasons, john, slidell, the, confederate, states, emissary, to, france, succeeded, in, negotiating, a, loan, of, 15, 000, 000, from, erlanger, and, other, french, capitalists, for, ironclad, warships, and, military, supplies, the, british, government, did, allow, the, construction, of, blockade, runners, in, britain, they, were, owned, and, operated, by, british, financiers, and, shipowners, a, few, were, owned, and, operated, by, the, confederacy, the, british, investors, goal, was, to, acquire, highly, profitable, cotton, several, european, nations, maintained, diplomats, in, place, who, had, been, appointed, to, the, u, s, but, no, country, appointed, any, diplomat, to, the, confederacy, those, nations, recognized, the, union, and, confederate, sides, as, belligerents, in, 1863, the, confederacy, expelled, european, diplomatic, missions, for, advising, their, resident, subjects, to, refuse, to, serve, in, the, confederate, army, both, confederate, and, union, agents, were, allowed, to, work, openly, in, british, territories, the, confederacy, appointed, ambrose, dudley, mann, as, special, agent, to, the, holy, see, in, september, 1863, but, the, holy, see, never, released, a, statement, supporting, or, recognizing, the, confederacy, in, november, 1863, mann, met, pope, pius, ix, and, received, a, letter, supposedly, addressed, to, the, illustrious, and, honorable, jefferson, davis, president, of, the, confederate, states, of, america, mann, had, mistranslated, the, address, in, his, report, to, richmond, mann, claimed, a, great, diplomatic, achievement, for, himself, but, confederate, secretary, of, state, judah, p, benjamin, told, mann, it, was, a, mere, inferential, recognition, unconnected, with, political, action, or, the, regular, establishment, of, diplomatic, relations, and, thus, did, not, assign, it, the, weight, of, formal, recognition, nevertheless, the, confederacy, was, seen, internationally, as, a, serious, attempt, at, nationhood, and, european, governments, sent, military, observers, to, assess, whether, there, had, been, a, de, facto, establishment, of, independence, these, observers, included, arthur, lyon, fremantle, of, the, british, coldstream, guards, who, entered, the, confederacy, via, mexico, fitzgerald, ross, of, the, austrian, hussars, and, justus, scheibert, of, the,

north, american, war, testified, this, government, is, no, longer, a, trial, government, but, really, a, normal, government, the, expression, of, popular, will, fremantle, went, on, to, write, in, his, book, three, months, in, the, southern, states, that, he, had, not, attempted, to, conceal, any, of, the, peculiarities, or, defects, of, the, southern, people, many, persons, will, doubtless, highly, disapprove, of, some, of, their, customs, and, habits, in, the, wilder, portion, of, the, country, but, i, think, no, generous, man, whatever, may, be, his, political, opinions, can, do, otherwise, than, admire, the, courage, energy, and, patriotism, of, the, whole, population, and, the, skill, of, its, leaders, in, this, struggle, against, great, odds, and, i, am, also, of, opinion, that, many, will, agree, with, me, in, thinking, that, a, people, in, which, all, ranks, and, both, sexes, display, a, unanimity, and, a, heroism, which, can, never, have, been, surpassed, in, the, history, of, the, world, is, destined, sooner, or, later, to, become, a, great, and, independent, nation, french, emperor, napoleon, iii, assured, confederate, diplomat, john, slidell, that, he, would, make, direct, proposition, to, britain, for, joint, recognition, the, emperor, made, the, same, assurance, to, british, members, of, parliament, john, a, roebuck, and, john, a, lindsay, roebuck, in, turn, publicly, prepared, a, bill, to, submit, to, parliament, supporting, joint, anglo, french, recognition, of, the, confederacy, southerners, had, a, right, to, be, optimistic, or, at, least, hopeful, that, their, revolution, would, prevail, or, at, least, endure, following, the, disasters, at, vicksburg, and, gettysburg, in, july, 1863, the, confederates, suffered, a, severe, loss, of, confidence, in, themselves, and, withdrew, into, an, interior, defensive, position, by, december, 1864, davis, considered, sacrificing, slavery, in, order, to, enlist, recognition, and, aid, from, paris, and, london, he, secretly, sent, duncan, f, kenner, to, europe, with, a, message, that, the, war, was, fought, solely, for, the, vindication, of, our, rights, to, self, government, and, independence, and, that, no, sacrifice, is, too, great, save, that, of, honor, the, message, stated, that, if, the, french, or, british, governments, made, their, recognition, conditional, on, anything, at, all, the, confederacy, would, consent, to, such, terms, european, leaders, all, saw, that, the, confederacy, was, on, the, verge, of, defeat, the, confederacy, s, biggest, foreign, policy, successes, were, with, brazil, and, cuba, militarily, this, meant, little, brazil, represented, the, peoples, most, identical, to, us, in, institutions, in, which, slavery, remained, legal, until, the, 1880s, and, the, abolitionist, movement, was, small, confederate, ships, were, welcome, in, brazilian, ports, after, the, war, brazil, was, the, primary, destination, of, those, southerners, who, wanted, to, continue, living, in, a, slave, society, where, as, one, immigrant, remarked, confederado, slaves, were, cheap, the, captain, general, of, cuba, declared, in, writing, that, confederate, ships, were, welcome, and, would, be, protected, in, cuban, ports, historians, speculate, that, if, the, confederacy, had, achieved, independence, it, probably, would, have, tried, to, acquire, cuba, as, a, base, of, expansion, most, soldiers, who, joined, confederate, national, or, state, military, units, joined, voluntarily, perman, 2010, says, historians, are, of, two, minds, on, why, millions, of, soldiers, seemed, so, eager, to, fight, suffer, and, die, over, four, years, some, historians, emphasize, that, civil, war, soldiers, were, driven, by, political, ideology, holding, firm, beliefs, about, the, importance, of, liberty, union, or, state, rights, or, about, the, need, to, protect, or, to, destroy, slavery, others, point, to, less, overtly, political, reasons, to, fight, such, as, the, defense, of, one, s, home, and, family, or, the, honor, and, brotherhood, to, be, preserved, when, fighting, alongside, other, men, most, historians, agree, that, no, matter, what, he, thought, about, when, he, went, into, the, war, the, experience, of, combat, affected, him, profoundly, and, sometimes, affected, his, reasons, for, continuing, to, fight, civil, war, historian, e, merton, coulter, wrote, that, for, those, who, would, secure, its, independence, the, confederacy, was, unfortunate, in, its, failure, to, work, out, a, general, strategy, for, the, whole, war, aggressive, strategy, called, for, offensive, force, concentration, defensive, strategy, sought, dispersal, to, meet, demands, of, locally, minded, governors, the, controlling, philosophy, evolved, into, a, combination, dispersal, with, a, defensive, concentration, around, richmond, the, davis, administration, considered, the, war, purely, defensive, a, simple, demand, that, the, people, of, the, united, states, would, cease, to, war, upon, us, historian, james, m, mcpherson, is, a, critic, of, lee, s, offensive, strategy, lee, pursued, a, faulty, military, strategy, that, ensured, confederate, defeat, as, the, confederate, government, lost, control, of, territory, in, campaign, after, campaign, it, was, said, that, the, vast, size, of, the, confederacy, would, make, its, conquest, impossible, the, enemy, would, be, struck, down, by, the, same, elements, which, so, often, debilitated, or, destroyed, visitors, and, transplants, in, the, south, heat, exhaustion, sunstroke, endemic, diseases, such, as, malaria, and, typhoid, would, match, the, destructive, effectiveness, of, the, moscow, winter, on, the, invading, armies, of, napoleon, early, in, the, war, both, sides, believed, that, one, great, battle, would, decide, the, conflict, the, confederates, won, a, surprise, victory, at, the, first, battle, of, bull, run, also, known, as, first, manassas, the, name, used, by, confederate, forces, it, drove, the, confederate, people, insane, with, joy, the, public, demanded, a, forward, movement, to, capture, washington, relocate, the, confederate, capital, there, and, admit, maryland, to, the, confederacy, a, council, of, war, by, the, victorious, confederate, generals, decided, not, to, advance, against, larger, numbers, of, fresh, federal, troops, in, defensive, positions, davis, did, not, countermand, it, following, the, confederate, incursion, into, maryland, halted, at, the, battle, of, antietam, in, october, 1862, generals, proposed, concentrating, forces, from, state, commands, to, re, invade, the, north, nothing, came, of, it, again, in, mid, 1863, at, his, incursion, into, pennsylvania, lee, requested, of, davis, that, beauregard, simultaneously, attack, washington, with, troops, taken, from, the, carolinas, but, the, troops, there, remained, in, place, during, the, gettysburg, campaign, the, eleven, states, of, the, confederacy, were, outnumbered, by, the, north, about, four, to, one, in, military, manpower, it, was, overmatched, far, more, in, military, equipment, industrial, facilities, railroads, for, transport, and, wagons, supplying, the, front, confederates, slowed, the, yankee, invaders, at, heavy, cost, to, the, southern, infrastructure, the, confederates, burned, bridges, laid, land, mines, in, the, roads, and, made, harbors, inlets, and, inland, waterways, unusable, with, sunken, mines, called, torpedoes, at, the, time, coulter, reports, rangers, in, twenty, to, fifty, man, units, were, awarded, 50, valuation, for, property, destroyed, behind, union, lines, regardless, of, location, or, loyalty, as, federals, occupied, the, south, objections, by, loyal, confederate, concerning, ranger, horse, stealing, and, indiscriminate, scorched, earth, tactics, behind, union, lines, led, to, congress, abolishing, the, ranger, service, two, years, later, the, confederacy, relied, on, external, sources, for, war, materials, the, first, came, from, trade, with, the, enemy, vast, amounts, of, war, supplies, came, through, kentucky, and, thereafter, western, armies, were, to, a, very, considerable, extent, provisioned, with, illicit, trade, via, federal, agents, and, northern, private, traders, but, that, trade, was, interrupted, in, the, first, year, of, war, by, admiral, porter, s, river, gunboats, as, they, gained, dominance, along, navigable, rivers, north, south, and, east, west, overseas, blockade, running, then, came, to, be, of, outstanding, importance, on, april, 17, president, davis, called, on, privateer, raiders, the, militia, of, the, sea, to, wage, war, on, u, s, seaborne, commerce, despite, noteworthy, effort, over, the, course, of, the, war, the, confederacy, was, found, unable, to, match, the, union, in, ships, and, seamanship, materials, and, marine, construction, an, inescapable, obstacle, to, success, in, the, warfare, of, mass, armies, was, the, confederacy, s, lack, of, manpower, and, sufficient, numbers, of, disciplined, equipped, troops, in, the, field, at, the, point, of, contact, with, the, enemy, during, the, winter, of, 1862, 63, lee, observed, that, none, of, his, famous, victories, had, resulted, in, the, destruction, of, the, opposing, army, he, lacked, reserve, troops, to, exploit, an, advantage, on, the, battlefield, as, napoleon, had, done, lee, explained, more, than, once, have, most, promising, opportunities, been, lost, for, want, of, men, to, take, advantage, of, them, and, victory, itself, had, been, made, to, put, on, the, appearance, of, defeat, because, our, diminished, and, exhausted, troops, have, been, unable, to, renew, a, successful, struggle, against, fresh, numbers, of, the, enemy, the, military, armed, forces, of, the, confederacy, comprised, three, branches, army, navy, and, marine, corps, on, february, 28, 1861, the, provisional, confederate, congress, established, a, provisional, volunteer, army, and, gave, control, over, military, operations, and, authority, for, mustering, state, forces, and, volunteers, to, the, newly, chosen, confederate, president, jefferson, davis, on, march, 1, 1861, on, behalf, of, the, confederate, government, davis, assumed, control, of, the, military, situation, at, charleston, south, carolina, where, south, carolina, state, militia, besieged, fort, sumter, in, charleston, harbor, held, by, a, small, u, s, army, garrison, by, march, 1861, the, provisional, confederate, congress, expanded, the, provisional, forces, and, established, a, more, permanent, confederate, states, army, the, total, population, of, the, confederate, army, is, unknowable, due, to, incomplete, and, destroyed, confederate, records, but, estimates, are, between, 750, 000, and, 1, 000, 000, troops, this, does, not, include, an, unknown, number, of, slaves, pressed, into, army, tasks, such, as, the, construction, of, fortifications, and, defenses, or, driving, wagons, confederate, casualty, figures, also, are, incomplete, and, unreliable, estimated, at, 94, 000, killed, or, mortally, wounded, 164, 000, deaths, from, disease, and, between, 26, 000, and, 31, 000, deaths, in, union, prison, camps, one, incomplete, estimate, is, 194, 026, the, confederate, military, leadership, included, many, veterans, from, the, united, states, army, and, united, states, navy, who, had, resigned, their, federal, commissions, and, were, appointed, to, senior, positions, many, had, served, in, the, mexican, american, war, including, robert, e, lee, and, jefferson, davis, but, some, such, as, leonidas, polk, who, graduated, from, west, point, but, did, not, serve, in, the, army, had, little, or, no, experience, the, confederate, officer, corps, consisted, of, men, from, both, slave, owning, and, non, slave, owning, families, the, confederacy, appointed, junior, and, field, grade, officers, by, election, from, the, enlisted, ranks, although, no, army, service, academy, was, established, for, the, confederacy, some, colleges, such, as, the, citadel, and, virginia, military, institute, maintained, cadet, corps, that, trained, confederate, military, leadership, a, naval, academy, was, established, at, drewry, s, bluff, virginia, in, 1863, but, no, midshipmen, graduated, before, the, confederacy, s, end, most, soldiers, were, white, males, aged, between, 16, and, 28, the, median, year, of, birth, was, 1838, so, half, the, soldiers, were, 23, or, older, by, 1861, the, confederate, army, was, permitted, to, disband, for, two, months, in, early, 1862, after, its, short, term, enlistments, expired, the, majority, of, those, in, uniform, would, not, re, enlist, after, their, one, year, commitment, thus, on, april, 16, 1862, the, confederate, congress, imposed, the, first, mass, conscription, on, north, american, territory, a, year, later, on, march, 3, 1863, the, united, states, congress, passed, the, enrollment, act, rather, than, a, universal, draft, the, first, program, was, a, selective, one, with, physical, religious, professional, and, industrial, exemptions, these, became, narrower, as, the, battle, progressed, initially, substitutes, were, permitted, but, by, december, 1863, these, were, disallowed, in, september, 1862, the, age, limit, was, increased, from, 35, to, 45, and, by, february, 1864, all, men, under, 18, and, over, 45, were, conscripted, to, form, a, reserve, for, state, defense, inside, state, borders, by, march, 1864, the, superintendent, of, conscription, reported, that, all, across, the, confederacy, every, officer, in, constituted, authority, man, and, woman, engaged, in, opposing, the, enrolling, officer, in, the, execution, of, his, duties, although, challenged, in, the, state, courts, the, confederate, state, supreme, courts, routinely, rejected, legal, challenges, to, conscription, many, thousands, of, slaves, served, as, personal, servants, to, their, owner, or, were, hired, as, laborers, cooks, and, pioneers, some, freed, blacks, and, men, of, color, served, in, local, state, militia, units, of, the, confederacy, primarily, in, louisiana, and, south, carolina, but, their, officers, deployed, them, for, local, defense, not, combat, depleted, by, casualties, and, desertions, the, military, suffered, chronic, manpower, shortages, in, early, 1865, the, confederate, congress, influenced, by, the, public, support, by, general, lee, approved, the, recruitment, of, black, infantry, units, contrary, to, lee, s, and, davis, s, recommendations, the, congress, refused, to, guarantee, the, freedom, of, black, volunteers, no, more, than, two, hundred, black, combat, troops, were, ever, raised, the, immediate, onset, of, war, meant, that, it, was, fought, by, the, provisional, or, volunteer, army, state, governors, resisted, concentrating, a, national, effort, several, wanted, a, strong, state, army, for, self, defense, others, feared, large, provisional, armies, answering, only, to, davis, when, filling, the, confederate, government, s, call, for, 100, 000, men, another, 200, 000, were, turned, away, by, accepting, only, those, enlisted, for, the, duration, or, twelve, month, volunteers, who, brought, their, own, arms, or, horses, it, was, important, to, raise, troops, it, was, just, as, important, to, provide, capable, officers, to, command, them, with, few, exceptions, the, confederacy, secured, excellent, general, officers, efficiency, in, the, lower, officers, was, greater, than, could, have, been, reasonably, expected, as, with, the, federals, political, appointees, could, be, indifferent, otherwise, the, officer, corps, was, governor, appointed, or, elected, by, unit, enlisted, promotion, to, fill, vacancies, was, made, internally, regardless, of, merit, even, if, better, officers, were, immediately, available, anticipating, the, need, for, more, duration, men, in, january, 1862, congress, provided, for, company, level, recruiters, to, return, home, for, two, months, but, their, efforts, met, little, success, on, the, heels, of, confederate, battlefield, defeats, in, february, congress, allowed, for, davis, to, require, numbers, of, recruits, from, each, governor, to, supply, the, volunteer, shortfall, states, responded, by, passing, their, own, draft, laws, the, veteran, confederate, army, of, early, 1862, was, mostly, twelve, month, volunteers, with, terms, about, to, expire, enlisted, reorganization, elections, disintegrated, the, army, for, two, months, officers, pleaded, with, the, ranks, to, re, enlist, but, a, majority, did, not, those, remaining, elected, majors, and, colonels, whose, performance, led, to, officer, review, boards, in, october, the, boards, caused, a, rapid, and, widespread, thinning, out, of, 1, 700, incompetent, officers, troops, thereafter, would, elect, only, second, lieutenants, in, early, 1862, the, popular, press, suggested, the, confederacy, required, a, million, men, under, arms, but, veteran, soldiers, were, not, re, enlisting, and, earlier, secessionist, volunteers, did, not, reappear, to, serve, in, war, one, macon, georgia, newspaper, asked, how, two, million, brave, fighting, men, of, the, south, were, about, to, be, overcome, by, four, million, northerners, who, were, said, to, be, cowards, the, confederacy, passed, the, first, american, law, of, national, conscription, on, april, 16, 1862, the, white, males, of, the, confederate, states, from, 18, to, 35, were, declared, members, of, the, confederate, army, for, three, years, and, all, men, then, enlisted, were, extended, to, a, three, year, term, they, would, serve, only, in, units, and, under, officers, of, their, state, those, under, 18, and, over, 35, could, substitute, for, conscripts, in, september, those, from, 35, to, 45, became, conscripts, the, cry, of, rich, man, s, war, and, a, poor, man, s, fight, led, congress, to, abolish, the, substitute, system, altogether, in, december, 1863, all, principals, benefiting, earlier, were, made, eligible, for, service, by, february, 1864, the, age, bracket, was, made, 17, to, 50, those, under, eighteen, and, over, forty, five, to, be, limited, to, in, state, duty, confederate, conscription, was, not, universal, it, was, a, selective, service, the, first, conscription, act, of, april, 1862, exempted, occupations, related, to, transportation, communication, industry, ministers, teaching, and, physical, fitness, the, second, conscription, act, of, october, 1862, expanded, exemptions, in, industry, agriculture, and, conscientious, objection, exemption, fraud, proliferated, in, medical, examinations, army, furloughs, churches, schools, apothecaries, and, newspapers, rich, men, s, sons, were, appointed, to, the, socially, outcast, overseer, occupation, but, the, measure, was, received, in, the, country, with, universal, odium, the, legislative, vehicle, was, the, controversial, twenty, negro, law, that, specifically, exempted, one, white, overseer, or, owner, for, every, plantation, with, at, least, 20, slaves, backpedaling, six, months, later, congress, provided, overseers, under, 45, could, be, exempted, only, if, they, held, the, occupation, before, the, first, conscription, act, the, number, of, officials, under, state, exemptions, appointed, by, state, governor, patronage, expanded, significantly, the, conscription, act, of, february, 1864, radically, changed, the, whole, system, of, selection, it, abolished, industrial, exemptions, placing, detail, authority, in, president, davis, as, the, shame, of, conscription, was, greater, than, a, felony, conviction, the, system, brought, in, about, as, many, volunteers, as, it, did, conscripts, many, men, in, otherwise, bombproof, positions, were, enlisted, in, one, way, or, another, nearly, 160, 000, additional, volunteers, and, conscripts, in, uniform, still, there, was, shirking, to, administer, the, draft, a, bureau, of, conscription, was, set, up, to, use, state, officers, as, state, governors, would, allow, it, had, a, checkered, career, of, contention, opposition, and, futility, armies, appointed, alternative, military, recruiters, to, bring, in, the, out, of, uniform, 17, 50, year, old, conscripts, and, deserters, nearly, 3, 000, officers, were, tasked, with, the, job, by, late, 1864, lee, was, calling, for, more, troops, our, ranks, are, constantly, diminishing, by, battle, and, disease, and, few, recruits, are, received, the, consequences, are, inevitable, by, march, 1865, conscription, was, to, be, administered, by, generals, of, the, state, reserves, calling, out, men, over, 45, and, under, 18, years, old, all, exemptions, were, abolished, these, regiments, were, assigned, to, recruit, conscripts, ages, 17, 50, recover, deserters, and, repel, enemy, cavalry, raids, the, service, retained, men, who, had, lost, but, one, arm, or, a, leg, in, home, guards, ultimately, conscription, was, a, failure, and, its, main, value, was, in, goading, men, to, volunteer, the, survival, of, the, confederacy, depended, on, a, strong, base, of, civilians, and, soldiers, devoted, to, victory, the, soldiers, performed, well, though, increasing, numbers, deserted, in, the, last, year, of, fighting, and, the, confederacy, never, succeeded, in, replacing, casualties, as, the, union, could, the, civilians, although, enthusiastic, in, 1861, 62, seem, to, have, lost, faith, in, the, future, of, the, confederacy, by, 1864, and, instead, looked, to, protect, their, homes, and, communities, as, rable, explains, this, contraction, of, civic, vision, was, more, than, a, crabbed, libertarianism, it, represented, an, increasingly, widespread, disillusionment, with, the, confederate, experiment, the, american, civil, war, broke, out, in, april, 1861, with, a, confederate, victory, at, the, battle, of, fort, sumter, in, charleston, in, january, president, james, buchanan, had, attempted, to, resupply, the, garrison, with, the, steamship, star, of, the, west, but, confederate, artillery, drove, it, away, in, march, president, lincoln, notified, south, carolina, governor, pickens, that, without, confederate, resistance, to, the, resupply, there, would, be, no, military, reinforcement, without, further, notice, but, lincoln, prepared, to, force, resupply, if, it, were, not, allowed, confederate, president, davis, in, cabinet, decided, to, seize, fort, sumter, before, the, relief, fleet, arrived, and, on, april, 12, 1861, general, beauregard, forced, its, surrender, following, sumter, lincoln, directed, states, to, provide, 75, 000, troops, for, three, months, to, recapture, the, charleston, harbor, forts, and, all, other, federal, property, this, emboldened, secessionists, in, virginia, arkansas, tennessee, and, north, carolina, to, secede, rather, than, provide, troops, to, march, into, neighboring, southern, states, in, may, federal, troops, crossed, into, confederate, territory, along, the, entire, border, from, the, chesapeake, bay, to, new, mexico, the, first, battles, were, confederate, victories, at, big, bethel, bethel, church, virginia, first, bull, run, first, manassas, in, virginia, july, and, in, august, wilson, s, creek, oak, hills, in, missouri, at, all, three, confederate, forces, could, not, follow, up, their, victory, due, to, inadequate, supply, and, shortages, of, fresh, troops, to, exploit, their, successes, following, each, battle, federals, maintained, a, military, presence, and, occupied, washington, dc, fort, monroe, virginia, and, springfield, missouri, both, north, and, south, began, training, up, armies, for, major, fighting, the, next, year, union, general, george, b, mcclellan, s, forces, gained, possession, of, much, of, northwestern, virginia, in, mid, 1861, concentrating, on, towns, and, roads, the, interior, was, too, large, to, control, and, became, the, center, of, guerrilla, activity, general, robert, e, lee, was, defeated, at, cheat, mountain, in, september, and, no, serious, confederate, advance, in, western, virginia, occurred, until, the, next, year, meanwhile, the, union, navy, seized, control, of, much, of, the, confederate, coastline, from, virginia, to, south, carolina, it, took, over, plantations, and, the, abandoned, slaves, federals, there, began, a, war, long, policy, of, burning, grain, supplies, up, rivers, into, the, interior, wherever, they, could, not, occupy, the, union, navy, began, a, blockade, of, the, major, southern, ports, and, prepared, an, invasion, of, louisiana, to, capture, new, orleans, in, early, 1862, the, victories, of, 1861, were, followed, by, a, series, of, defeats, east, and, west, in, early, 1862, to, restore, the, union, by, military, force, the, federal, strategy, was, to, 1, secure, the, mississippi, river, 2, seize, or, close, confederate, ports, and, 3, march, on, richmond, to, secure, independence, the, confederate, intent, was, to, 1, repel, the, invader, on, all, fronts, costing, him, blood, and, treasure, and, 2, carry, the, war, into, the, north, by, two, offensives, in, time, to, affect, the, mid, term, elections, much, of, northwestern, virginia, was, under, federal, control, in, february, and, march, most, of, missouri, and, kentucky, were, union, occupied, consolidated, and, used, as, staging, areas, for, advances, further, south, following, the, repulse, of, a, confederate, counterattack, at, the, battle, of, shiloh, tennessee, permanent, federal, occupation, expanded, west, south, and, east, confederate, forces, repositioned, south, along, the, mississippi, river, to, memphis, tennessee, where, at, the, naval, battle, of, memphis, its, river, defense, fleet, was, sunk, confederates, withdrew, from, northern, mississippi, and, northern, alabama, new, orleans, was, captured, on, april, 29, by, a, combined, army, navy, force, under, u, s, admiral, david, farragut, and, the, confederacy, lost, control, of, the, mouth, of, the, mississippi, river, it, had, to, concede, extensive, agricultural, resources, that, had, supported, the, union, s, sea, supplied, logistics, base, although, confederates, had, suffered, major, reverses, everywhere, as, of, the, end, of, april, the, confederacy, still, controlled, territory, holding, 72, of, its, population, federal, forces, disrupted, missouri, and, arkansas, they, had, broken, through, in, western, virginia, kentucky, tennessee, and, louisiana, along, the, confederacy, s, shores, union, forces, had, closed, ports, and, made, garrisoned, lodgments, on, every, coastal, confederate, state, except, alabama, and, texas, although, scholars, sometimes, assess, the, union, blockade, as, ineffectual, under, international, law, until, the, last, few, months, of, the, war, from, the, first, months, it, disrupted, confederate, privateers, making, it, almost, impossible, to, bring, their, prizes, into, confederate, ports, british, firms, developed, small, fleets, of, blockade, running, companies, such, as, john, fraser, and, company, and, s, isaac, campbell, company, while, the,

1862, was, the, strategic, high, water, mark, of, the, confederacy, the, failures, of, the, two, invasions, were, attributed, to, the, same, irrecoverable, shortcomings, lack, of, manpower, at, the, front, lack, of, supplies, including, serviceable, shoes, and, exhaustion, after, long, marches, without, adequate, food, also, in, september, confederate, general, william, w, loring, pushed, federal, forces, from, charleston, virginia, and, the, kanawha, valley, in, western, virginia, but, lacking, reinforcements, loring, abandoned, his, position, and, by, november, the, region, was,

this, constitution, replicated, the, united, states, constitution, verbatim, but, contained, several, explicit, protections, of, the, institution, of, slavery, including, provisions, for, the, recognition, and, protection, of, slavery, in, any, territory, of, the, confederacy, it, maintained, the, ban, on, international, slave, trading, though, it, made, the, ban, s, application, explicit,

the, powers, of, the, central, government, more, than, the, u, s, constitution, of, the, time, did, but, in, other, areas, the, states, lost, rights, they, had, under, the, u, s, constitution, although, the, confederate, constitution, like, the, u, s, constitution, contained, a, commerce, clause, the, confederate, version, prohibited, the, central, government, from, using, revenues,

each, of, the, 12, amendments, to, the, u, s, constitution, that, had, been, ratified, up, to, that, point, the, second, confederate, constitution, was, finally, adopted, on, february, 22, 1862, one, year, into, the, american, civil, war, and, did, not, specifically, include, a, provision, allowing, states, to, secede, the, preamble, spoke, of, each, state, acting, in, its, sovereign, and, independent, character, but, also, of, the, formation, of, a, permanent, federal, government, during, the, debates, on, drafting, the, confederate, constitution, one, proposal, would, have, allowed, states, to, secede, from, the, confederacy, the, proposal, was, tabled, with, only, the, south, carolina, delegates, voting, in, favor, of, considering, the, motion, the, confederate, constitution, also, explicitly, denied, states, the, power, to, bar, slaveholders, from, other, parts, of, the, confederacy, from, bringing, their, slaves, into, any, state, of, the, confederacy, or, to, interfere,

speech, greatly, impressed, with, its, clear, rationale, for, secession, and, his, pleading, for, a, peaceful, departure, from, the, union, to, independence, although, he, had, made, it, known, that, he, wanted, to, be, commander, in, chief, of, the, confederate, armies, when, elected, he, assumed, the, office, of, provisional, president, three, candidates, for, provisional, vice, president, were, under, consideration, the, night, before, the, february, 9, election, all, were, from, georgia, and, the, various, delegations, meeting, in, different, places, determined, two, would, not, do, so,

accomplished, by, men, who, saw, themselves, as, fundamentally, conservative, although, they, referred, to, their, revolution, it, was, in, their, eyes, more, a, counter, revolution, against, changes, away, from, their, understanding, of, u, s, founding, documents, in, davis, inauguration, speech, he, explained, the, confederacy, was, not, a, french, like, revolution, but, a, transfer, of, rule, the, montgomery, convention, had, assumed, all, the, laws, of, the, united, states, until, superseded, by, the, confederate, congress, the, permanent, constitution, provided, for, a, president, of, the, confederate, states, of, america, elected, to, serve, a, six, year, term, but, without, the, possibility, of, re, election, unlike, the, united, states, constitution, the, confederate, constitution, gave, the, president, the, ability, to, subject, a, bill, to, a, line, item, veto, a, power, also, held, by, some, state, governors, the, confederate, congress, could, overturn, either, the, general, or, the, line, item, vetoes, with, the, same, two, thirds, votes, required, in, the, u, s, congress, in, addition, appropriations, not, specifically, requested, by, the, executive, branch, required, passage, by, a, two, thirds, vote, in, both, houses, of, congress, the, only, person, to, serve, as, president, was, jefferson, davis, as, the, confederacy, was, defeated, before,

for, the, first, year, the, unicameral, provisional, confederate, congress, functioned, as, the, confederacy, s, legislative, branch, the, confederate, constitution, outlined, a, judicial, branch, of, the, government, but, the, ongoing, war, and, resistance, from, states, rights, advocates, particularly, on, the, question, of, whether, it, would, have, appellate, jurisdiction, over, the, state, courts, prevented, the, creation, or, seating, of, the, supreme, court, of, the, confederate, states, thus, the, state, courts, generally, continued, to, operate, as, they, had, done, simply, recognizing, the, confederate, states, as, the, national, government, confederate, district, courts, were, authorized, by, article, iii, section, 1, of, the, confederate, constitution, and, president,

states, district, judges, confederate, district, courts, began, reopening, in, early, 1861, handling, many, of, the, same, type, cases, as, had, been, done, before, prize, cases, in, which, union, ships, were, captured, by, the, confederate, navy, or, raiders, and, sold, through, court, proceedings, were, heard, until, the, blockade, of, southern, ports, made, this, impossible, after, a, sequestration, act, was, passed, by, the, confederate, congress, the, confederate, district, courts, heard, many, cases, in, which, enemy, aliens, typically, northern, absentee, landlords, owning, property, in, the, south, had, their, property, sequestered, seized, by, confederate, receivers, when, the, matter, came, before, the, confederate, court, the, property, owner, could, not, appear, because, he, was, unable, to, travel, across, the, front, lines, between, union, and, confederate, forces, thus, the, district, attorney, won, the, case, by, default, the, property, was, typically, sold, and, the, money, used, to, further, the, southern, war, effort, eventually, because, there, was, no, confederate, supreme, court, sharp, attorneys, like, south, carolina, s, edward, mccrady, began, filing, appeals, this, prevented, their, clients, property, from, being, sold, until, a, supreme, court, could, be, constituted, to, hear, the, appeal, which, never, occurred, where, federal, troops, gained, control, over, parts, of, the, confederacy, and, re, established, civilian, government, us, district, courts, sometimes, resumed, jurisdiction, supreme, court, not, established, district, courts, judges, when, the, confederacy, was, formed, and, its, seceding, states, broke, from, the, union, it, was, at, once, confronted, with, the, arduous, task, of, providing, its, citizens, with, a, mail, delivery, system, and, amid, the, american, civil, war, the, newly, formed, confederacy, created, and, established, the, confederate, post, office, one, of, the, first, undertakings, in, establishing, the, post, office, was, the, appointment, of, john, h, reagan, to, the, position, of, postmaster, general, by, jefferson, davis, in, 1861, this, made, him, the, first, postmaster, general, of, the, confederate, post, office, and, a, member, of, davis, s, presidential, cabinet, writing, in, 1906, historian, walter, flavius, mccaleb, praised, reagan, s, energy, and, intelligence, in, a, degree, scarcely, matched, by, any, of, his, associates, when, the, war, began, the, us, post, office, briefly, delivered, mail, from, the, secessionist, states, mail, that, was, postmarked, after, the, date, of, a, state, s, admission, into, the, confederacy, through, may, 31, 1861, and, bearing, us, postage, was, still, delivered, after, this, time, private, express, companies, still, managed, to, carry, some, of, the, mail, across, enemy, lines, later, mail, that, crossed, lines, had, to, be, sent, by, flag, of, truce, and, was, allowed, to, pass, at, only, two, specific, points, mail, sent, from, the, confederacy, to, the, u, s, was, received, opened, and, inspected, at, fortress, monroe, on, the, virginia, coast, before, being, passed, on, into, the, u, s, mail, stream, mail, sent, from, the, north, to, the, south, passed, at, city, point, also, in, virginia, where, it, was, also, inspected, before, being, sent, on, with, the, chaos, of, the, war, a, working, postal, system, was, more, important, than, ever, for, the, confederacy, the, civil, war, had, divided, family, members, and, friends, and, consequently, letter, writing, increased, dramatically, across, the, entire, divided, nation, especially, to, and, from, the, men, who, were, away, serving, in, an, army, mail, delivery, was, also, important, for, the, confederacy, for, a, myriad, of, business, and, military, reasons, because, of, the, union, blockade, basic, supplies, were, always, in, demand, and, so, getting, mailed, correspondence, out, of, the, country, to, suppliers, was, imperative, to, the, successful, operation, of, the, confederacy, volumes, of, material, have, been, written, about, the, blockade, runners, who, evaded, union, ships, on, blockade, patrol, usually, at, night, and, who, moved, cargo, and, mail, in, and, out, of, the, confederate, states, throughout, the, course, of, the, war, of, particular, interest, to, students, and, historians, of, the, american, civil, war, is, prisoner, of, war, mail, and, blockade, mail, as, these, items, were, often, involved, with, a, variety, of, military, and, other, war, time, activities, the, postal, history, of, the, confederacy, along, with, surviving, confederate, mail, has, helped, historians, document, the, various, people, places, and, events, that, were, involved, in, the, american, civil, war, as, it, unfolded, the, confederacy, actively, used, the, army, to, arrest, people, suspected, of, loyalty, to, the, united, states, historian, mark, neely, found, 4, 108, names, of, men, arrested, and, estimated, a, much, larger, total, the, confederacy, arrested, pro, union, civilians, in, the, south, at, about, the, same, rate, as, the, union, arrested, pro, confederate, civilians, in, the, north, neely, argues, the, confederate, citizen, was, not, any, freer, than, the, union, citizen, and, perhaps, no, less, likely, to, be, arrested, by, military, authorities, in, fact, the, confederate, citizen, may, have, been, in, some, ways, less, free, than, his, northern, counterpart, for, example, freedom, to, travel, within, the, confederate, states, was, severely, limited, by, a, domestic, passport, system, across, the, south, widespread, rumors, alarmed, the, whites, by, predicting, the, slaves, were, planning, some, sort, of, insurrection, patrols, were, stepped, up, the, slaves, did, become, increasingly, independent, and, resistant, to, punishment, but, historians, agree, there, were, no, insurrections, in, the, invaded, areas, insubordination, was, more, the, norm, than, was, loyalty, to, the, old, master, bell, wiley, says, it, was, not, disloyalty, but, the, lure, of, freedom, many, slaves, became, spies, for, the, north, and, large, numbers, ran, away, to, federal, lines, according, to, the, 1860, united, states, census, the, 11, states, that, seceded, had, the, highest, percentage, of, slaves, as, a, proportion, of, their, population, representing, 39, of, their, total, population, the, proportions, ranged, from, a, majority, in, south, carolina, 57, 2, and, mississippi, 55, 2, to, about, a, quarter, in, arkansas, 25, 5, and, tennessee, 24, 8, lincoln, s, emancipation, proclamation, an, executive, order, of, the, u, s, government, on, january, 1, 1863, changed, the, legal, status, of, three, million, slaves, in, designated, areas, of, the, confederacy, from, slave, to, free, the, long, term, effect, was, that, the, confederacy, could, not, preserve, the, institution, of, slavery, and, lost, the, use, of, the, core, element, of, its, plantation, labor, force, slaves, were, legally, freed, by, the, proclamation, and, became, free, by, escaping, to, federal, lines, or, by, advances, of, federal, troops, over, 200, 000, freed, slaves, were, hired, by, the, federal, army, as, teamsters, cooks, launderers, and, laborers, and, eventually, as, soldiers, plantation, owners, realizing, that, emancipation, would, destroy, their, economic, system, sometimes, moved, their, slaves, as, far, as, possible, out, of, reach, of, the, union, army, though, the, concept, was, promoted, within, certain, circles, of, the, union, hierarchy, during, and, immediately, following, the, war, no, program, of, reparations, for, freed, slaves, was, ever, attempted, unlike, other, western, countries, such, as, britain, and, france, the, u, s, government, never, paid, compensation, to, southern, slave, owners, for, their, lost, property, the, only, place, compensated, emancipation, was, carried, out, was, the, district, of, columbia, according, to, the, 1860, united, states, census, about, 31, of, free, households, in, the, eleven, states, that, would, join, the, confederacy, owned, slaves, most, whites, were, subsistence, farmers, who, traded, their, surpluses, locally, the, plantations, of, the, south, with, white, ownership, and, an, enslaved, labor, force, produced, substantial, wealth, from, cash, crops, it, supplied, two, thirds, of, the, world, s, cotton, which, was, in, high, demand, for, textiles, along, with, tobacco, sugar, and, naval, stores, such, as, turpentine, these, raw, materials, were, exported, to, factories, in, europe, and, the, northeast, planters, reinvested, their, profits, in, more, slaves, and, fresh, land, as, cotton, and, tobacco, depleted, the, soil, there, was, little, manufacturing, or, mining, shipping, was, controlled, by, non, southerners, the, plantations, that, enslaved, over, three, million, black, people, were, the, principal, source, of, wealth, most, were, concentrated, in, black, belt, plantation, areas, because, few, white, families, in, the, poor, regions, owned, slaves, for, decades, there, had, been, widespread, fear, of, slave, revolts, during, the, war, extra, men, were, assigned, to, home, guard, patrol, duty, and, governors, sought, to, keep, militia, units, at, home, for, protection, historian, william, barney, reports, no, major, slave, revolts, erupted, during, the, civil, war, nevertheless, slaves, took, the, opportunity, to, enlarge, their, sphere, of, independence, and, when, union, forces, were, nearby, many, ran, off, to, join, them, slave, labor, was, applied, in, industry, in, a, limited, way, in, the, upper, south, and, in, a, few, port, cities, one, reason, for, the, regional, lag, in, industrial, development, was, top, heavy, income, distribution, mass, production, requires, mass, markets, and, slaves, living, in, small, cabins, using, self, made, tools, and, outfitted, with, one, suit, of, work, clothes, each, year, of, inferior, fabric, did, not, generate, consumer, demand, to, sustain, local, manufactures, of, any, description, in, the, same, way, as, did, a, mechanized, family, farm, of, free, labor, in, the, north, the, southern, economy, was, pre, capitalist, in, that, slaves, were, put, to, work, in, the, largest, revenue, producing, enterprises, not, free, labor, markets, that, labor, system, as, practiced, in, the, american, south, encompassed, paternalism, whether, abusive, or, indulgent, and, that, meant, labor, management, considerations, apart, from, productivity, approximately, 85, of, both, the, north, and, south, white, populations, lived, on, family, farms, both, regions, were, predominantly, agricultural, and, mid, century, industry, in, both, was, mostly, domestic, but, the, southern, economy, was, pre, capitalist, in, its, overwhelming, reliance, on, the, agriculture, of, cash, crops, to, produce, wealth, while, the, great, majority, of, farmers, fed, themselves, and, supplied, a, small, local, market, southern, cities, and, industries, grew, faster, than, ever, before, but, the, thrust, of, the, rest, of, the, country, s, exponential, growth, elsewhere, was, toward, urban, industrial, development, along, transportation, systems, of, canals, and, railroads, the, south, was, following, the, dominant, currents, of, the, american, economic, mainstream, but, at, a, great, distance, as, it, lagged, in, the, all, weather, modes, of, transportation, that, brought, cheaper, speedier, freight, shipment, and, forged, new, expanding, inter, regional, markets, a, third, count, of, the, pre, capitalist, southern, economy, relates, to, the, cultural, setting, white, southerners, did, not, adopt, a, work, ethic, nor, the, habits, of, thrift, that, marked, the, rest, of, the, country, it, had, access, to, the, tools, of, capitalism, but, it, did, not, adopt, its, culture, the, southern, cause, as, a, national, economy, in, the, confederacy, was, grounded, in, slavery, and, race, planters, and, patricians, plain, folk, and, folk, culture, cotton, and, plantations, the, confederacy, started, its, existence, as, an, agrarian, economy, with, exports, to, a, world, market, of, cotton, and, to, a, lesser, extent, tobacco, and, sugarcane, local, food, production, included, grains, hogs, cattle, and, gardens, the, cash, came, from, exports, but, the, southern, people, spontaneously, stopped, exports, in, early, 1861, to, hasten, the, impact, of, king, cotton, a, failed, strategy, to, coerce, international, support, for, the, confederacy, through, its, cotton, exports, when, the, blockade, was, announced, commercial, shipping, practically, ended, the, ships, could, not, get, insurance, and, only, a, trickle, of, supplies, came, via, blockade, runners, the, cutoff, of, exports, was, an, economic, disaster, for, the, south, rendering, useless, its, most, valuable, properties, its, plantations, and, their, enslaved, workers, many, planters, kept, growing, cotton, which, piled, up, everywhere, but, most, turned, to, food, production, all, across, the, region, the, lack, of, repair, and, maintenance, wasted, away, the, physical, assets, the, eleven, states, had, produced, 155, million, 4, 29, billion, in, 2023, in, manufactured, goods, in, 1860, chiefly, from, local, gristmills, and, lumber, processed, tobacco, cotton, goods, and, naval, stores, such, as, turpentine, the, main, industrial, areas, were, border, cities, such, as, baltimore, wheeling, louisville, and, st, louis, that, were, never, under, confederate, control, the, government, did, set, up, munitions, factories, in, the, deep, south, combined, with, captured, munitions, and, those, coming, via, blockade, runners, the, armies, were, kept, minimally, supplied, with, weapons, the, soldiers, suffered, from, reduced, rations, lack, of, medicines, and, the, growing, shortages, of, uniforms, shoes, and, boots, shortages, were, much, worse, for, civilians, and, the, prices, of, necessities, steadily, rose, the, confederacy, adopted, a, tariff, or, tax, on, imports, of, 15, and, imposed, it, on, all, imports, from, other, countries, including, the, united, states, the, tariff, mattered, little, the, union, blockade, minimized, commercial, traffic, through, the, confederacy, s, ports, and, very, few, people, paid, taxes, on, goods, smuggled, from, the, north, the, confederate, government, in, its, entire, history, collected, only, 3, 5, million, in, tariff, revenue, the, lack, of, adequate, financial, resources, led, the, confederacy, to, finance, the, war, through, printing, money, which, led, to, high, inflation, the, confederacy, underwent, an, economic, revolution, by, centralization, and, standardization, but, it, was, too, little, too, late, as, its, economy, was, systematically, strangled, by, blockade, and, raids, in, peacetime, the, south, s, extensive, and, connected, systems, of, navigable, rivers, and, coastal, access, allowed, for, cheap, and, easy, transportation, of, agricultural, products, the, railroad, system, in, the, south, had, developed, as, a, supplement, to, the, navigable, rivers, to, enhance, the, all, weather, shipment, of, cash, crops, to, market, railroads, tied, plantation, areas, to, the, nearest, river, or, seaport, and, so, made, supply, more, dependable, lowered, costs, and, increased, profits, in, the, event, of, invasion, the, vast, geography, of, the, confederacy, made, logistics, difficult, for, the, union, wherever, union, armies, invaded, they, assigned, many, of, their, soldiers, to, garrison, captured, areas, and, to, protect, rail, lines, at, the, onset, of, the, civil, war, the, south, had, a, rail, network, disjointed, and, plagued, by, changes, in, track, gauge, as, well, as, lack, of, interchange, locomotives, and, freight, cars, had, fixed, axles, and, could, not, use, tracks, of, different, gauges, widths, railroads, of, different, gauges, leading, to, the, same, city, required, all, freight, to, be, off, loaded, onto, wagons, for, transport, to, the, connecting, railroad, station, where, it, had, to, await, freight, cars, and, a, locomotive, before, proceeding, centers, requiring, off, loading, included, vicksburg, new, orleans, montgomery, wilmington, and, richmond, in, addition, most, rail, lines, led, from, coastal, or, river, ports, to, inland, cities, with, few, lateral, railroads, because, of, this, design, limitation, the, relatively, primitive, railroads, of, the, confederacy, were, unable, to, overcome, the, union, naval, blockade, of, the, south, s, crucial, intra, coastal, and, river, routes, the, confederacy, had, no, plan, to, expand, protect, or, encourage, its, railroads, southerners, refusal, to, export, the, cotton, crop, in, 1861, left, railroads, bereft, of, their, main, source, of, income, many, lines, had, to, lay, off, employees, many, critical, skilled, technicians, and, engineers, were, permanently, lost, to, military, service, in, the, early, years, of, the, war, the, confederate, government, had, a, hands, off, approach, to, the, railroads, only, in, mid, 1863, did, the, confederate, government, initiate, a, national, policy, and, it, was, confined, solely, to, aiding, the, war, effort, railroads, came, under, the, de, facto, control, of, the, military, in, contrast, the, u, s, congress, had, authorized, military, administration, of, union, controlled, railroad, and, telegraph, systems, in, january, 1862, imposed, a, standard, gauge, and, built, railroads, into, the, south, using, that, gauge, confederate, armies, successfully, reoccupying, territory, could, not, be, resupplied, directly, by, rail, as, they, advanced, the, c, s, congress, formally, authorized, military, administration, of, railroads, in, february, 1865, in, the, last, year, before, the, end, of, the, war, the, confederate, railroad, system, stood, permanently, on, the, verge, of, collapse, there, was, no, new, equipment, and, raids, on, both, sides, systematically, destroyed, key, bridges, as, well, as, locomotives, and, freight, cars, spare, parts, were, cannibalized, feeder, lines, were, torn, up, to, get, replacement, rails, for, trunk, lines, and, rolling, stock, wore, out, through, heavy, use, the, confederate, army, experienced, a, persistent, shortage, of, horses, and, mules, and, requisitioned, them, with, dubious, promissory, notes, given, to, local, farmers, and, breeders, union, forces, paid, in, real, money, and, found, ready, sellers, in, the, south, both, armies, needed, horses, for, cavalry, and, for, artillery, mules, pulled, the, wagons, the, supply, was, undermined, by, an, unprecedented, epidemic, of, glanders, a, fatal, disease, that, baffled, veterinarians, after, 1863, the, invading, union, forces, had, a, policy, of, shooting, all, the, local, horses, and, mules, that, they, did, not, need, in, order, to, keep, them, out, of, confederate, hands, the, confederate, armies, and, farmers, experienced, a, growing, shortage, of, horses, and, mules, which, hurt, the, southern, economy, and, the, war, effort, the, south, lost, half, of, its, 2, 5, million, horses, and, mules, many, farmers, ended, the, war, with, none, left, army, horses, were, used, up, by, hard, work, malnourishment, disease, and, battle, wounds, they, had, a, life, expectancy, of, about, seven, months, both, the, individual, confederate, states, and, later, the, confederate, government, printed, confederate, states, of, america, dollars, as, paper, currency, in, various, denominations, with, a, total, face, value, of, 1, 5, billion, much, of, it, was, signed, by, treasurer, edward, c, elmore, inflation, became, rampant, as, the, paper, money, depreciated, and, eventually, became, worthless, the, state, governments, and, some, localities, printed, their, own, paper, money, adding, to, the, runaway, inflation, many, bills, still, exist, although, in, recent, years, counterfeit, copies, have, proliferated, the, confederate, government, initially, wanted, to, finance, its, war, mostly, through, tariffs, on, imports, export, taxes, and, voluntary, donations, of, gold, after, the, spontaneous, imposition, of, an, embargo, on, cotton, sales, to, europe, in, 1861, these, sources, of, revenue, dried, up, and, the, confederacy, increasingly, turned, to, issuing, debt, and, printing, money, to, pay, for, war, expenses, the, confederate, states, politicians, were, worried, about, angering, the, general, population, with, hard, taxes, a, tax, increase, might, disillusion, many, southerners, so, the, confederacy, resorted, to, printing, more, money, as, a, result, inflation, increased, and, remained, a, problem, for, the, southern, states, throughout, the, rest, of, the, war, by, april, 1863, for, example, the, cost, of, flour, in, richmond, had, risen, to, 100, 2, 475, in, 2023, a, barrel, and, housewives, were, rioting, the, confederate, government, took, over, the, three, national, mints, in, its, territory, the, charlotte, mint, in, north, carolina, the, dahlonega, mint, in, georgia, and, the, new, orleans, mint, in, louisiana, during, 1861, all, of, these, facilities, produced, small, amounts, of, gold, coinage, and, the, latter, half, dollars, as, well, since, the, mints, used, the, current, dies, on, hand, all, appear, to, be, u, s, issues, however, by, comparing, slight, differences, in, the, dies, specialists, can, distinguish, 1861, o, half, dollars, that, were, minted, either, under, the, authority, of, the, u, s, government, the, state, of, louisiana, or, finally, the, confederate, states, unlike, the, gold, coins, this, issue, was, produced, in, significant, numbers, over, 2, 5, million, and, is, inexpensive, in, lower, grades, although, fakes, have, been, made, for, sale, to, the, public, however, before, the, new, orleans, mint, ceased, operation, in, may, 1861, the, confederate, government, used, its, own, reverse, design, to, strike, four, half, dollars, this, made, one, of, the, great, rarities, of, american, numismatics, a, lack, of, silver, and, gold, precluded, further, coinage, the, confederacy, apparently, also, experimented, with, issuing, one, cent, coins, although, only, 12, were, produced, by, a, jeweler, in, philadelphia, who, was, afraid, to, send, them, to, the, south, like, the, half, dollars, copies, were, later, made, as, souvenirs, us, coinage, was, hoarded, and, did, not, have, any, general, circulation, u, s, coinage, was, admitted, as, legal, tender, up, to, 10, as, were, british, sovereigns, french, napoleons, and, spanish, and, mexican, doubloons, at, a, fixed, rate, of, exchange, confederate, money, was, paper, and, postage, stamps, by, mid, 1861, the, union, naval, blockade, virtually, shut, down, the, export, of, cotton, and, the, import, of, manufactured, goods, food, that, formerly, came, overland, was, cut, off, as, women, were, the, ones, who, remained, at, home, they, had, to, make, do, with, the, lack, of, food, and, supplies, they, cut, back, on, purchases, used, old, materials, and, planted, more, flax, and, peas, to, provide, clothing, and, food, they, used, ersatz, substitutes, when, possible, but, there, was, no, real, coffee, only, okra, and, chicory, substitutes, the, households, were, severely, hurt, by, inflation, in, the, cost, of, everyday, items, like, flour, and, the, shortages, of, food, fodder, for, the, animals, and, medical, supplies, for, the, wounded, state, governments, requested, that, planters, grow, less, cotton, and, more, food, but, most, refused, when, cotton, prices, soared, in, europe, expectations, were, that, europe, would, soon, intervene, to, break, the, blockade, and, make, them, rich, but, europe, remained, neutral, the, georgia, legislature, imposed, cotton, quotas, making, it, a, crime, to, grow, an, excess, but, food, shortages, only, worsened, especially, in, the, towns, the, overall, decline, in, food, supplies, made, worse, by, the, inadequate, transportation, system, led, to, serious, shortages, and, high, prices, in, urban, areas, when, bacon, reached, a, dollar, a, pound, in, 1863, the, poor, women, of, richmond, atlanta, and, many, other, cities, began, to, riot, they, broke, into, shops, and, warehouses, to, seize, food, as, they, were, angry, at, ineffective, state, relief, efforts, speculators, and, merchants, as, wives, and, widows, of, soldiers, they, were, hurt, by, the, inadequate, welfare, system, by, the, end, of, the, war, deterioration, of, the, southern, infrastructure, was, widespread, the, number, of, civilian, deaths, is, unknown, every, confederate, state, was, affected, but, most, of, the, war, was, fought, in, virginia, and, tennessee, while, texas, and, florida, saw, the, least, military, action, much, of, the, damage, was, caused, by, direct, military, action, but, most, was, caused, by, lack, of, repairs, and, upkeep, and, by, deliberately, using, up, resources, historians, have, recently, estimated, how, much, of, the, devastation, was, caused, by, military, action, paul, paskoff, calculates, that, union, military, operations, were, conducted, in, 56, of, 645, counties, in, nine, confederate, states, excluding, texas, and, florida, these, counties, contained, 63, of, the, 1860, white, population, and, 64, of, the, slaves, by, the, time, the, fighting, took, place, undoubtedly, some, people, had, fled, to, safer, areas, so, the, exact, population, exposed, to, war, is, unknown, the, eleven, confederate, states, in, the, 1860, united, states, census, had, 297, towns, and, cities, with, 835, 000, people, of, these, 162, with, 681, 000, people, were, at, one, point, occupied, by, union, forces, eleven, were, destroyed, or, severely, damaged, by, war, action, including, atlanta, with, an, 1860, population, of, 9, 600, charleston, columbia, and, richmond, with, prewar, populations, of, 40, 500, 8, 100, and, 37, 900, respectively, the, eleven, contained, 115, 900, people, in, the, 1860, census, or, 14, of, the, urban, south, historians, have, not, estimated, what, their, actual, population, was, when, union, forces, arrived, the, number, of, people, as, of, 1860, who, lived, in, the, destroyed, towns, represented, just, over, 1, of, the, confederacy, s, 1860, population, in, addition, 45, court, houses, were, burned, out, of, 830, the, south, s, agriculture, was, not, highly, mechanized, the, value, of, farm, implements, and, machinery, in, the, 1860, census, was, 81, million, by, 1870, there, was, 40, less, worth, just, 48, million, many, old, tools, had, broken, through, heavy, use, new, tools, were, rarely, available, even, repairs, were, difficult, the, economic, losses, affected, everyone, banks, and, insurance, companies, were, mostly, bankrupt, confederate, currency, and, bonds, were, worthless, the, billions, of, dollars, invested, in, slaves, vanished, most, debts, were, also, left, behind, most, farms, were, intact, but, most, had, lost, their, horses, mules, and, cattle, fences, and, barns, were, in, disrepair, paskoff, shows, the, loss, of, farm, infrastructure, was, about, the, same, whether, or, not, fighting, took, place, nearby, the, loss, of, infrastructure, and, productive, capacity, meant, that, rural, widows, throughout, the, region, faced, not, only, the, absence, of, able, bodied, men, but, a, depleted, stock, of, material, resources, that, they, could, manage, and, operate, themselves, during, four, years, of, warfare, disruption, and, blockades, the, south, used, up, about, half, its, capital, stock, the, north, by, contrast, absorbed, its, material, losses, so, effortlessly, that, it, appeared, richer, at, the, end, of, the, war, than, at, the, beginning, the, rebuilding, took, years, and, was, hindered, by,

needed, for, economic, recovery, one, of, the, greatest, calamities, which, confronted, southerners, was, the, havoc, wrought, on, the, transportation, system, roads, were, impassable, or, nonexistent, and, bridges, were, destroyed, or, washed, away, the, important, river, traffic, was, at, a, standstill, levees, were, broken, channels, were, blocked, the, few, steamboats, which, had, not, been, captured, or, destroyed, were, in, a, state, of, disrepair, wharves, had, decayed, or, were, missing, and, trained, personnel, were, dead, or, dispersed, horses, mules, oxen, carriages, wagons, and, carts, had, nearly, all, fallen, prey, at, one, time, or, another, to, the, contending, armies, the, railroads, were, paralyzed, with, most, of, the, companies, bankrupt, these, lines,

even, those, areas, bypassed, by, battle, had, been, pirated, for, equipment, needed, on, the, battlefront, and, the, wear, and, tear, of, wartime, usage, without, adequate, repairs, or, replacements, reduced, all, to, a, state, of, disintegration, more, than, 250, 000, confederate, soldiers, died, during, the, war, some, widows, abandoned, their, family, farms, and, merged, into, the, households, of, relatives, or, even, became, refugees, living, in, camps, with, high, rates, of, disease, and, death, in, the, old, south, being, an, old, maid, was, an, embarrassment, to, the, woman, and, her, family, but, after, the, war, it, became, almost, a, norm, some, women, welcomed, the, freedom, of, not, having, to, marry, divorce, while, never, fully, accepted, became, more, common, the, concept, of, the, new, woman, emerged, she, was, self, sufficient, and, independent, and, stood, in, sharp, contrast, to, the, southern, belle, of, antebellum, lore, the, first, official, flag, of, the, confederate, states, of, america, called, the, stars, and, bars, originally, had, seven, stars, representing, the, first, seven, states, that, initially, formed, the, confederacy, as, more, states, joined, more, stars, were, added, until, the, total, was, 13, two, stars, were, added, for, the, divided, states, of, kentucky, and, missouri, during, the, first, battle, of, bull, run, first, manassas, it, sometimes, proved, difficult, to, distinguish, the, stars, and, bars, from, the, union, flag, to, rectify, the, situation, a, separate, battle, flag, was, designed, for, use, by, troops, in, the, field, also, known, as, the, southern, cross, many, variations, sprang, from, the, original, square, configuration, although, it, was, never, officially, adopted, by, the, confederate, government, the, popularity, of, the, southern, cross, among, both, soldiers, and, the, civilian, population, was, a, primary, reason, why, it, was, made, the, main, color, feature, when, a, new, national, flag, was, adopted, in, 1863, this, new, standard, known, as, the, stainless, banner, consisted, of, a, lengthened, white, field, area, with, a, battle, flag, canton, this, flag, too, had, its, problems, when, used, in, military, operations, as, on, a, windless, day, it, could, easily, be, mistaken, for, a, flag, of, truce, or, surrender, thus, in, 1865, a, modified, version, of, the, stainless, banner, was, adopted, this, final, national, flag, of, the, confederacy, kept, the, battle, flag, canton, but, shortened, the, white, field, and, added, a, vertical, red, bar, to, the, fly, end, because, of, its, depiction, in, the, 20th, century, and, popular, media, many, people, consider, the, rectangular, battle, flag, with, the, dark, blue, bars, as, being, synonymous, with, the, confederate, flag, but, this, flag, was, never, adopted, as, a, confederate, national, flag, the, confederate, flag, has, a, color, scheme, similar, to, that, of, the, most, common, battle, flag, design, but, is, rectangular, not, square, the, confederate, flag, is, a, highly, recognizable, symbol, of, the, south, in, the, united, states, today, and, continues, to, be, a, controversial, icon, unionism, opposition, to, the, confederacy, was, strong, in, certain, areas, within, the, confederate, states, southern, unionists, were, widespread, in, the, mountain, regions, of, appalachia, and, the, ozarks, unionists, led, by, parson, brownlow, and, senator, andrew, johnson, took, control, of, east, tennessee, in, 1863, unionists, also, attempted, control, over, western, virginia, but, never, effectively, held, more, than, half, of, the, counties, that, formed, the, new, state, of, west, virginia, union, forces, captured, parts, of, coastal, north, carolina, and, at, first, were, largely, welcomed, by, local, unionists, the, occupiers, became, perceived, as, oppressive, callous, radical, and, favorable, to, freedmen, occupiers, pillaged, freed, slaves, and, evicted, those,

supported, the, confederacy, after, the, war, began, but, many, others, clung, to, their, unionism, throughout, the, war, especially, in, the, northern, counties, german, districts, in, the, texas, hill, country, and, majority, mexican, areas, randolph, b, campbell, states, in, spite, of, terrible, losses, and, hardships, most, texans, continued, throughout, the, war, to, support, the, confederacy, as, they, had, supported, secession, dale, baum, in, his, analysis, of, texas, politics, in, the, era, counters, this, idea, of, a, confederate, texas, united, politically, against, northern, adversaries, was, shaped, more, by, nostalgic, fantasies, than, by, wartime, realities, he, characterizes, texas, civil, war, history, as, a, morose, story, of, intragovernmental, rivalries, coupled, with, wide, ranging, disaffection, that, prevented, effective, implementation, of, state, wartime, policies, in, texas, local, officials, harassed, and, murdered, unionists, and, germans,

from, the, region, s, dominant, pre, war, planter, class, the, confederate, states, of, america, claimed, a, total, of, 2, 919, miles, 4, 698, km, of, coastline, thus, a, large, part, of, its, territory, lay, on, the, seacoast, with, level, and, often, sandy, or, marshy, ground, most, of, the, interior, portion, consisted, of, arable, farmland, though, much, was, also, hilly, and, mountainous, and, the, far, western, territories, were, deserts, the, southern, reaches, of, the, mississippi, river, bisected, the, country, and, the, western, half, was, often, referred, to, as,

additional, amnesty, acts, in, may, 1866, with, restrictions, on, office, holding, and, the, amnesty, act, in, may, 1872, lifting, those, restrictions, there, was, a, great, deal, of, discussion, in, 1865, about, bringing, treason, trials, especially, against, jefferson, davis, there, was, no, consensus, in, president, johnson, s, cabinet, and, no, one, was, charged, with, treason, an, acquittal, of, davis, would, have, been, humiliating, for, the, government, davis, was, indicted, for, treason, but, never, tried, he, was, released, from, prison, on, bail, in, may, 1867, the, amnesty, of, december, 25, 1868, by, president, johnson, eliminated, any, possibility, of, jefferson, davis, or, anyone, else, associated, with, the, confederacy, standing, trial, for, treason, henry, wirz, the, commandant, of, a, notorious, prisoner, of, war, camp, near, andersonville, georgia, was, tried, and, convicted, by, a, military, court, and, executed, on, november, 10, 1865, the, charges, against, him, involved, conspiracy, and, cruelty, not, treason, the, u, s, government, began, a, decade, long, process, known, as, reconstruction, which, attempted, to, resolve, the, political, and, constitutional, issues, of, the, civil, war, the, priorities, were, to, guarantee, that, confederate, nationalism, and, slavery, were, ended, to, ratify, and, enforce, the, thirteenth, amendment, which, outlawed, slavery, the, fourteenth, which, guaranteed, dual, u, s, and, state, citizenship, to, all, native, born, residents, regardless, of, race, the, fifteenth, which, made, it, illegal, to, deny, the, right, to, vote, because, of, race, and, repeal, each, state, s, ordinance, of, secession, by, 1877, the, compromise, of, 1877, ended, reconstruction, in, the, former, confederate, states,

fraud, to, suppress, black, voting, the, prewar, south, had, many, rich, areas, the, war, left, the, entire, region, economically, devastated, by, military, action, ruined, infrastructure, and, exhausted, resources, still, dependent, on, an, agricultural, economy, and, resisting, investment, in, infrastructure, it, remained, dominated, by, the, planter, elite, into, the, next, century, confederate, veterans, had, been, temporarily, disenfranchised, by, reconstruction, policy, and, democrat, dominated, legislatures, passed, new, constitutions, and, amendments, to, now, exclude, most, blacks, and, many, poor, whites, this, exclusion, and, a, weakened, republican, party, remained, the, norm, until, the, voting, rights, act, of, 1965, the, solid, south, of, the, early, 20th, century, did, not, achieve, national, levels, of, prosperity, until, long, after, world, war, ii, in, texas, v, white, the, united, states, supreme, court, ruled, by, a, 5, 3, majority, that, texas, had, remained, a, state, ever, since, it, first, joined, the, union, despite, claims, that, it, joined, the, confederate, states, of, america, in, this, case, the, court, held, that, the, constitution, did, not, permit, a, state, to, unilaterally, secede, from, the, united, states, further, that, the, ordinances, of, secession, and, all, the, acts, of, the, legislatures, within, the, eleven, seceding, states, intended, to, give, effect, to, such, ordinances, were, absolutely, null, under, the, constitution, this, case, settled, the, law, that, applied, to, all, questions, regarding, state, legislation, during, the, war, furthermore, it, decided, one, of, the, central, constitutional, questions, of, the, civil, war, the, union, is, perpetual, and, indestructible, as, a, matter, of, constitutional, law, in, declaring, that, no, state, could, leave, the, union, except, through, revolution, or, through, consent, of, the, states, it, was, explicitly, repudiating, the, position, of, the, confederate, states, that, the, united, states, was, a, voluntary, compact, between, sovereign, states, in, sprott, v, united, states, the, supreme, court, ruled, by, a, 8, 1, majority, to, reaffirm, its, conclusion, in, white, and, held, that, the, confederate, states, of, america, was, little, more, than, a, briefly, existing, breakaway, state, specifically, the, opinion, would, condemn, the, confederacy, as, treasonous, and, as, totally, perishing, upon, being, overthrown, writing, for, the, court, s, majority, associate, justice, samuel, freeman, miller, would, remark, that, it, had, no, existence, except, as, a, conspiracy, to, overthrow, lawful, authority, its, foundation, was, treason, against, the, existing, federal, government, its, single, purpose, so, long, as, it, lasted, was, to, make, that, treason, successful, so, far, from, being, necessary, to, the, organization, of, civil, government, or, to, its, maintenance, and, support, it, was, inimical, to, social, order, destructive, to, the, best, interests, of, society, and, its, primary, object, was, to, overthrow, the, government, on, which, these, so, largely, depended, its, existence, and, temporary, power, were, an, enormous, evil, which, the, whole, force, of, the, government, and, the, people, of, the, united, states, was, engaged, for, years, in, destroying, when, it, was, overthrown, it, perished, totally, it, left, no, laws, no, statutes, no, decrees, no, authority, which, can, give, support, to, any, contract, or, any, act, done, in, its, service, or, in, aid, of, its, purpose, or, which, contributed, to, protract, its, existence, historian, frank, lawrence, owsley, argued, that, the, confederacy, died, of, states, rights, the, central, government, was, denied, requisitioned, soldiers, and, money, by, governors, and, state, legislatures, because, they, feared, that, richmond, would, encroach, on, the, rights, of, the, states, georgia, s, governor, joseph, brown, warned, of, a, secret, conspiracy, by, jefferson, davis, to, destroy, states, rights, and, individual, liberty, the, first, conscription, act, in, north, america, authorizing, davis, to, draft, soldiers, was, said, to, be, the, essence, of, military, despotism, roger, lowenstein, argued, in, ways, and, means, lincoln, and, his, cabinet, and, the, financing, of, the, civil, war, 2022, that, the, confederacy, s, failure, to, raise, adequate, revenue, led, to, hyperinflation, and, being, unable, to, win, a, war, of, attrition, despite, the, prowess, of, its, military, leadership, such, as, robert, e, lee, vice, president, alexander, h, stephens, feared, losing, the, very, form, of, republican, government, allowing, president, davis, to, threaten, arbitrary, arrests, to, draft, hundreds, of, governor, appointed, bomb, proof, bureaucrats, conferred, more, power, than, the, english, parliament, had, ever, bestowed, on, the, king, history, proved, the, dangers, of, such, unchecked, authority, the, abolishment, of, draft, exemptions, for, newspaper, editors, was, interpreted, as, an, attempt, by, the, confederate, government, to, muzzle, presses, such, as, the, raleigh, nc, standard, to, control, elections, and, to, suppress, the, peace, meetings, there, as, rable, concludes, for, stephens, the, essence, of, patriotism, the, heart, of, the, confederate, cause, rested, on, an, unyielding, commitment, to, traditional, rights, without, considerations, of, military, necessity, pragmatism, or, compromise, in, 1863, governor, pendleton, murrah, of, texas, determined, that, state, troops, were, required, for, defense, against, plains, indians, and, union, forces, that, might, attack, from, kansas, he, refused, to, send, his, soldiers, to, the, east, governor, zebulon, vance, of, north, carolina, showed, intense, opposition, to, conscription, limiting, recruitment, success, vance, s, faith, in, states, rights, drove, him, into, repeated, stubborn, opposition, to, the, davis, administration, though, political, differences, were, within, the, confederacy, no, national, political, parties, were, formed, because, they, were, seen, as, illegitimate, anti, partyism, became, an, article, of, political, faith, without, a, system, of, political, parties, building, alternate, sets, of, national, leaders, electoral, protests, tended, to, be, narrowly, state, based, negative, carping, and, petty, the, 1863, mid, term, elections, became, mere, expressions, of, futile, and, frustrated, dissatisfaction, according, to, historian, david, m, potter, the, lack, of, a, functioning, two, party, system, caused, real, and, direct, damage, to, the, confederate, war, effort, since, it, prevented, the, formulation, of, any, effective, alternatives, to, the, conduct, of, the, war, by, the, davis, administration, the, enemies, of, president, davis, proposed, that, the, confederacy, died, of, davis, he, was, unfavorably, compared, to, george, washington, by, critics, such, as, edward, alfred, pollard, editor, of, the, most, influential, newspaper, in, the, confederacy, the, richmond, virginia, examiner, beyond, the, early, honeymoon, period, davis, was, never, popular, e, merton, coulter, viewed, by, historians, as, a, confederate, apologist, says, davis, was, heroic, but, his, tenacity, determination, and, will, power, stirred, up, lasting, opposition, from, enemies, he, failed, to, overcome, petty, leaders, of, the, states, who, made, the, term, confederacy, into, a, label, for, tyranny, and, oppression, preventing, the, stars, and, bars, from, becoming, a, symbol, of, larger, patriotic, service, and, sacrifice, instead, of, campaigning, to, develop, nationalism, and, gain, support, for, his, administration, he, rarely, courted, public, opinion, assuming, an, aloofness, almost, like, an, adams, escott, argues, that, davis, was, unable, to, mobilize, confederate, nationalism, in, support, of, his, government, effectively, and, especially, failed, to, appeal, to, the, small, farmers, who, made, up, the, bulk, of, the, population, escott, also, emphasizes, that, the, widespread, opposition, to, any, strong, central, government, combined, with, the, vast, difference, in, wealth, between, the, slave, owning, class, and, the, small, farmers, created, insolvable, dilemmas, when, the, confederate, survival, presupposed, a, strong, central, government, backed, by, a, united, populace, the, prewar, claim, that, white, solidarity, was, necessary, to, provide, a, unified, southern, voice, in, washington, no, longer, held, davis, failed, to, build, a, network, of, supporters, who, would, speak, up, when, he, came, under, criticism, and, he, repeatedly, alienated, governors, and, other, state, based, leaders, by, demanding, centralized, control, of, the, war, effort, according, to, coulter, davis, was, not, an, efficient, administrator, as, he, attended, to, too, many, details, protected, his, friends, after, their, failures, were, obvious, and, spent, too, much, time, on, military, affairs, versus, his, civic, responsibilities, coulter, concludes, he, was, not, the, ideal, leader, for, the, southern, revolution, but, he, showed, fewer, weaknesses, than, any, other, contemporary, character, available, for, the, role
