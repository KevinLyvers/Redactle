to, pay, protection, money, to, avoid, further, inroads, into, byzantine, thrace, eight, years, later, asparuh, led, a, successful, campaign, against, byzantine, thrace, tervel, first, mentioned, in, the, byzantine, texts, in, 704, when, the, deposed, emperor, justinian, ii, came, to, him, and, asked, for, his, aid, supported, justinian, in, an, attempted, restoration, to, the, byzantine, throne,

rewarded, tervel, with, many, gifts, the, title, of, kaisar, caesar, which, made, him, second, only, to, the, emperor, and, the, first, foreign, ruler, in, byzantine, history, to, receive, such, a, title, and, possibly, a, territorial, concession, in, northeastern, thrace, a, region, called, zagore, whether, justinian, s, daughter, anastasia, was, married, to, tervel, as, had, been, arranged, is, unknown, a, mere, three, years, later, justinian, ii, himself, violated, this, arrangement, and, apparently, commenced, military, operations, to, recover, the, ceded, area, tervel, routed, him, at, the, battle, of, anchialus, or, ankhialo, in, 708, in, 711, faced, by, a, serious, revolt, in, asia, minor, justinian, again, sought, the, aid, of, tervel, but, obtained, only, lukewarm, support, manifested, in, an, army, of, 3, 000, outmaneuvered, by, the, rebel, emperor, philippicus, justinian, was, captured, and, executed, while, his, bulgar, allies, were, allowed, to, retire, to, their,

information, of, the, imennik, tervel, died, in, 715, however, the, byzantine, chronicler, theophanes, the, confessor, ascribes, tervel, a, role, in, an, attempt, to, restore, the, deposed, emperor, anastasius, ii, in, 718, or, 719, if, tervel, did, survive, this, long, he, was, the, bulgarian, ruler, who, concluded, a, new, treaty, with, emperor, theodosius, iii, in, 716, confirming, the, annual, tribute, paid, by, the, byzantines, to, bulgaria, and, the, territorial, concessions, in, thrace, as, well, as, regulating, commercial, relations, and, the, treatment, of, political, refugees, and, he, was, also, the, bulgarian, ruler, who, helped, relieve, the, second, arab, siege, of, constantinople, in, 717, 718, by, land, according, to, theophanes, the, bulgars, slaughtered, some, 22,

and, 775, the, new, byzantine, emperor, constantine, v, led, nine, campaigns, against, his, northern, neighbour, to, establish, a, byzantine, border, on, the, danube, due, to, the, frequent, change, of, rulers, eight, khans, held, the, throne, in, twenty, years, and, the, constant, political, crisis, bulgaria, was, on, the, verge, of, destruction, in, his, first, campaign, in, 756, constantine, v, was, successful, and, managed, to, defeat, the, bulgars, twice, but, in, 759, vinekh, the, bulgar, khan, defeated, the, byzantine, army, comprehensively, in, the, battle, of, the, rishki, pass, vinekh, then, sought, to, make, peace, with, the, byzantines, but, was, assassinated, by, bulgar, nobles, the, new, ruler, telets, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, anchialus, in, 763, during, their, next, campaigns, both, sides, failed, to, gain, significant, success, because, the, byzantines, could, not, pass, through, the, balkan, mountains, and, their, fleet, was, destroyed, twice, in, heavy, storms, 2, 600, ships, sank, in, just, one, of, the, storms, in, 765, in, 774, they, defeated, an, inferior, bulgarian, force, at, berzitia, but, this, was, the, last, success, of, constantine, v, as, a, result, of, their, defeat, the, bulgars, took, serious, precautions, to, get, rid, of, the, byzantine, spies, in, pliska, khan, telerig, sent, a, secret, emissary, to, constantine, v, indicating, his, intention, to, flee, bulgaria, and, seek, refuge, with, the, emperor, and, seeking, assurances, of, hospitality, telerig, succeeded, in, having, the, emperor, betray, his, own, agents, in, bulgaria, who, were, duly, rounded, up, and, executed, in, response, constantine, v, invaded, bulgaria, once, again, in, 775, but, became, ill, and, died, on, his, return, journey, to, constantinople, in, 791, the, byzantine, emperor, constantine, vi, embarked, on, an, expedition, against, bulgaria, in, retaliation, for, bulgarian, incursions, in, the, struma, valley, since, 789, kardam, pre, empted, the, byzantine, invasion, and, met, the, enemy, near, adrianople, in, thrace, the, byzantine, army, was, defeated, and, turned, to, flight, in, 792, constantine, vi, led, another, army, against, the, bulgars, and, encamped, at, marcellae, near, karnobat, which, he, proceeded, to, fortify, kardam, arrived, with, his, army, on, july, 20, and, occupied, the, neighboring, heights, after, some, time, passed, with, the, two, forces, sizing, up, each, other, constantine, vi, ordered, the, attack, but, in, the, resulting, battle, of, marcellae, the, byzantine, forces, lost, formation, and, once, again, were, defeated, and, turned, to, flight, kardam, captured, the, imperial, tent, and, the, emperor, s, servants, after, his, return, to, constantinople, constantine, vi, signed, a, peace, treaty, and, undertook, to, pay, an, annual, tribute, to, bulgaria, by, 796, the, imperial, government, was, recalcitrant, and, kardam, found, it, necessary, to, demand, the, tribute, while, threatening, to, devastate, thrace, if, it, were, not, paid, according, to, the, chronicler, theophanes, the, confessor, constantine, vi, mocked, the, demand, by, having, dung, sent, instead, of, gold, as, fitting, tribute, and, promising, to, lead, a, new, army, against, the, elderly, kardam, at, marcellae, once, again, the, emperor, s, army, headed, north, and, once, again, it, encountered, kardam, in, the, vicinity, of, adrianople, the, armies, faced, each, other, for, 17, days, without, entering, into, battle, while, the, two, monarchs, probably, engaged, in, negotiations, in, the, end, conflict, was, averted, and, the, peace, resumed, on, the, same, terms, as, in, 792, khan, krum, engaged, in, an, aggressive, policy, within, the, balkans, raiding, along, the, struma, valley, in, 807, where, he, defeated, a, byzantine, army, and, captured, an, enormous, amount, of, gold, intended, as, wages, for, the, whole, byzantine, army, in, 809, krum, besieged, and, forced, the, surrender, of, serdica, sofia, slaughtering, the, byzantine, garrison, in, spite, of, his, promise, of, safe, conduct, this, provoked, byzantine, emperor, nikephoros, i, to, settle, anatolian, populations, along, the, frontier, to, protect, it, and, to, attempt, to, retake, and, refortify, serdica, although, this, enterprise, ultimately, failed, in, early, 811, nikephoros, i, undertook, a, massive, expedition, against, bulgaria, advancing, to, marcellae, near, karnobat, here, krum, attempted, to, negotiate, on, july, 11, 811, but, nikephoros, was, determined, to, continue, his, advance, his, army, managed, to, avoid, bulgar, ambushes, in, the, balkan, mountains, and, defeated, an, army, of, 12, 000, that, tried, to, block, their, advance, into, moesia, another, hastily, assembled, army, of, 50, 000, was, defeated, before, the, walls, of, the, bulgarian, capital, pliska, which, fell, to, the, emperor, on, july, 20, here, nikephoros, who, had, been, a, financial, minister, before, becoming, emperor, helped, himself, to, the, treasures, of, krum, while, setting, the, city, ablaze, and, turning, his, army, on, the, population, a, new, diplomatic, tentative, from, krum, was, rebuffed, nikephorus, showed, great, cruelty, ordering, his, army, to, kill, the, population, of, the, capital, increasingly, concerned, about, the, breakdown, of, discipline, in, his, army, nikephoros, finally, began, to, retreat, towards, thrace, in, the, meantime, krum, had, mobilized, as, many, of, his, subjects, as, he, could, including, the, women, and, had, begun, to, set, traps, and, ambushes, for, the, retreating, imperial, army, in, the, mountain, passes, at, dawn, on, july, 26, the, byzantines, found, themselves, trapped, against, a, moat, and, wooden, wall, in, the, v, rbica, pass, nikephoros, was, killed, in, the, ensuing, battle, along, with, many, of, his, troops, while, his, son, staurakios, was, carried, to, safety, by, the, imperial, bodyguard, after, receiving, a, paralyzing, wound, to, his, neck, according, to, tradition, krum, had, the, emperor, s, skull, lined, with, silver, and, used, it, as, a, drinking, cup, this, enhanced, his, reputation, for, brutality, and, won, him, the, nickname, new, sennacherib, staurakios, was, forced, to, abdicate, after, a, brief, reign, he, died, from, his, wound, in, 812, and, was, succeeded, by, his, brother, in, law, michael, i, rangabe, in, 812, krum, invaded, byzantine, thrace, taking, develt, and, scaring, the, population, of, nearby, fortresses, to, flee, towards, constantinople, from, this, position, of, strength, krum, offered, a, return, to, the, peace, treaty, of, 716, unwilling, to, compromise, his, regime, by, weakness, the, new, emperor, michael, i, refused, to, accept, the, proposal, seemingly, opposing, the, clause, for, exchange, of, deserters, to, apply, more, pressure, on, the, emperor, krum, besieged, and, captured, mesembria, nesebar, in, the, fall, of, 812, in, february, 813, the, bulgars, raided, into, thrace, but, were, repelled, by, the, emperor, s, forces, encouraged, by, this, success, michael, i, summoned, troops, from, the, entire, empire, and, headed, north, hoping, for, a, decisive, victory, krum, led, his, army, south, towards, adrianople, and, pitched, camp, near, versinikia, michael, i, lined, up, his, army, against, the, bulgars, but, neither, side, initiated, an, attack, for, two, weeks, finally, on, june, 22, 813, the, byzantines, attacked, but, were, immediately, turned, to, flight, with, krum, s, cavalry, in, pursuit, the, rout, of, michael, i, was, complete, and, krum, advanced, on, constantinople, which, he, besieged, by, land, discredited, michael, was, forced, to, abdicate, and, become, a, monk, the, third, byzantine, emperor, undone, by, krum, in, as, many, years, the, new, emperor, leo, v, the, armenian, offered, to, negotiate, and, arranged, for, a, meeting, with, krum, as, krum, arrived, he, was, ambushed, by, byzantine, archers, and, was, wounded, as, he, made, his, escape, furious, krum, ravaged, the, environs, of, constantinople, and, headed, home, capturing, adrianople, en, route, and, transplanting, its, inhabitants, including, the, parents, of, the, future, emperor, basil, i, across, the, danube, in, spite, of, the, approach, of, winter, krum, took, advantage, of, good, weather, to, send, a, force, of, 30, 000, into, thrace, capturing, arkadioupolis, l, leburgaz, and, carrying, off, some, 50, 000, captives, the, loot, from, thrace, was, used, to, enrich, krum, and, his, nobility, and, included, architectural, elements, utilized, in, the, reconstruction, of, pliska, perhaps, largely, by, captured, byzantine, artisans, krum, spent, the, winter, preparing, for, a, major, attack, on, constantinople, where, rumor, reported, the, assemblage, of, an, extensive, siege, park, to, be, transported, on, 5, 000, carts, he, died, before, he, set, out, however, on, april, 13, 814, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, omurtag, the, reign, of, khan, omurtag, opened, with, an, invasion, of, the, byzantine, empire, after, the, rejection, of, byzantine, offers, for, peace, the, bulgars, penetrated, as, far, south, as, modern, babaeski, bulgarophygon, then, but, there, they, were, defeated, by, emperor, leo, v, the, armenian, and, omurtag, escaped, the, battlefield, on, his, swift, horse, the, battle, was, not, a, decisive, blow, for, the, bulgars, though, it, certainly, had, some, effect, the, possibility, of, an, anti, bulgar, alliance, between, the, byzantine, and, the, frankish, empires, the, need, to, consolidate, bulgar, authority, in, the, newly, conquered, lands, and, the, new, stirring, of, the, tribes, in, the, steppes, gave, reason, for, omurtag, to, conclude, a, 30, year, peace, treaty, with, the, byzantines, in, 815, which, was, partly, inscribed, on, a, surviving, column, found, near, the, village, of, seltsi, shumen, province, according, to, that, inscription, the, treaty, specified, the, border, in, thrace, the, issue, with, those, slavs, who, remained, in, byzantium, and, the, exchange, of, the, other, prisoners, of, war, the, treaty, was, honoured, by, both, sides, and, was, renewed, after, the, accession, of, the, new, byzantine, emperor, michael, ii, to, the, throne, in, 820, in, 821, thomas, the, slav, rebelled, against, the, byzantine, emperor, and, laid, siege, to, constantinople, seeking, to, seize, the, imperial, throne, for, himself, khan, omurtag, sent, an, army, to, help, michael, ii, put, down, the, rebellion, attacking, the, rebels, at, the, battle, of, kedouktos, winter, 822, or, spring, 823, although, byzantine, accounts, report, that, thomas, s, army, was, routed, modern, scholars, consider, the, battle, a, victory, albeit, costly, for, thomas, after, the, expiration, of, the, original, 20, year, peace, treaty, with, the, byzantine, empire, in, 836, emperor, theophilos, ravaged, the, regions, within, the, bulgarian, frontier, the, bulgars, retaliated, and, under, the, leadership, of, isbul, the, minister, of, malamir, they, reached, adrianople, at, this, time, if, not, earlier, the, bulgars, captured, philippopolis, plovdiv, and, its, environs, several, surviving, monumental, inscriptions, from, this, reign, make, reference, to, the, bulgar, victories, and, others, to, the, continuation, of, construction, activities, in, and, near, pliska, the, war, ended, however, when, slavs, in, the, vicinity, of, thessalonica, rebelled, against, the, byzantine, empire, in, 837, emperor, theophilos, sought, bulgar, support, in, putting, down, the, rebellion, but, he, simultaneously, arranged, for, his, fleet, to, sail, through, the, danube, delta, and, undertake, a, clandestine, evacuation, of, some, of, the, byzantine, captives, settled, in, trans, danubian, bulgaria, by, krum, and, omurtag, in, retaliation, isbul, campaigned, along, the, aegean, coasts, of, thrace, and, macedonia, and, captured, the, city, of, philippi, where, theophilos, set, up, a, surviving, memorial, inscription, in, a, local, church, isbul, s, campaign, may, have, resulted, in, the, establishment, of, bulgar, suzerainty, over, the, slavic, tribe, of, the, smoljani, despite, his, able, diplomacy, statesmanship, and, his, importance, in, the, process, of, converting, bulgaria, to, christianity, boris, i, was, not, a, particularly, successful, leader, in, war, being, at, various, times, defeated, by, the, franks, croats, serbs, and, byzantines, soon, after, coming, to, power, boris, launched, a, brief, campaign, against, the, byzantines, in, 852, no, details, of, the, outcome, of, this, war, are, extant, though, it, is, possible, he, may, have, gained, some, territory, in, inland, macedonia, another, conflict, between, the, byzantines, and, bulgarians, started, in, 855, 856, the, empire, wanted, to, regain, its, control, over, some, areas, of, inland, thrace, and, the, ports, around, the, gulf, of, burgas, on, the, black, sea, the, byzantine, forces, led, by, the, emperor, and, the, caesar, bardas, were, successful, in, the, conflict, and, reconquered, a, number, of, cities, philippopolis, develtus, anchialus, and, mesembria, being, among, them, and, also, the, frontier, region, between, sider, and, develtus, known, as, zagora, in, northeastern, thrace, at, the, time, of, this, campaign, the, bulgarians, were, distracted, by, a, war, with, the, franks, under, louis, the, german, and, the, croatians, in, 863, boris, made, a, decision, to, embrace, christianity, and, he, sought, a, mission, from, the, franks, the, byzantines, could, not, countenance, so, close, a, neighbor, as, bulgaria, falling, under, frankish, religious, control, byzantium, had, recently, gained, a, major, victory, over, the, arabs, and, was, free, to, field, a, considerable, military, force, against, bulgaria, a, fleet, was, sent, into, the, black, sea, and, an, army, dispatched, to, invade, bulgaria, as, the, bulk, of, boris, army, was, campaigning, against, moravia, far, to, the, northwest, he, had, little, choice, but, to, yield, immediately, he, broke, off, the, frankish, alliance, allowed, greek, clergy, to, enter, bulgaria, and, was, eventually, baptized, with, the, byzantine, emperor, michael, iii, as, his, sponsor, boris, took, the, additional, name, of, michael, at, his, baptism, the, bulgarians, were, allowed, to, recover, the, debatable, region, of, zagora, as, a, reward, for, their, change, of, religious, orientation, with, the, ascendance, of, simeon, i, to, the, throne, in, 893, the, long, lasting, peace, with, the, byzantine, empire, established, by, his, father, was, about, to, end, a, conflict, arose, when, byzantine, emperor, leo, vi, the, wise, acting, under, pressure, from, his, wife, zoe, zaoutzaina, and, her, father, stylianos, zaoutzes, moved, the, marketplace, for, bulgarian, goods, from, constantinople, to, thessaloniki, where, bulgarian, merchants, were, heavily, taxed, forced, to, take, action, in, the, autumn, of, 894, simeon, invaded, the, byzantine, empire, from, the, north, meeting, little, opposition, due, to, the, concentration, of, most, byzantine, forces, in, eastern, anatolia, to, counter, arab, invasions, informed, of, the, bulgarian, offensive, the, surprised, leo, sent, an, army, consisting, of, guardsmen, and, other, military, units, from, the, capital, to, halt, simeon, but, his, troops, were, routed, somewhere, in, the, theme, of, macedonia, the, magyars, managed, to, defeat, simeon, s, army, twice, but, in, 896, they, were, routed, in, the, battle, of, southern, buh, the, war, ended, in, 896, with, a, great, bulgarian, victory, near, bulgarophygon, in, eastern, thrace, the, market, was, returned, to, constantinople, and, the, byzantine, emperor, had, to, pay, annual, tribute, to, bulgaria, more, importantly, with, help, from, the, pechenegs, simeon, successfully, fended, off, a, magyar, invasion, which, was, coordinated, with, the, byzantines, after, the, death, of, leo, vi, on, 11, may, 912, and, the, accession, of, his, infant, son, constantine, vii, under, the, guidance, of, leo, s, brother, alexander, who, expelled, leo, s, last, wife, and, constantine, s, mother, zoe, karbonopsina, from, the, palace, simeon, claimed, the, imperial, title, and, tried, to, replace, byzantium, as, the, biggest, power, in, the, region, perhaps, building, a, new, bulgarian, byzantine, empire, alexander, died, on, 6, june, 913, leaving, the, capital, in, anarchy, and, the, rule, of, the, empire, in, the, hands, of, a, regency, council, headed, by, patriarch, nicholas, mystikos, this, gave, the, bulgarian, ruler, a, great, opportunity, to, attempt, a, campaign, towards, the, byzantine, capital, so, he, attacked, in, full, force, in, late, july, or, august, 913, reaching, constantinople, without, any, serious, resistance, the, protracted, negotiations, resulted, in, the, payment, of, the, arrears, in, the, byzantine, tribute, the, promise, that, constantine, vii, would, marry, one, of, simeon, s, daughters, and, most, importantly, simeon, s, official, recognition, as, emperor, tzar, of, the, bulgarians, by, patriarch, nicholas, in, the, blachernai, palace, until, the, end, of, his, reign, simeon, used, the, style, of, emperor, of, the, bulgarians, and, the, romans, shortly, after, simeon, visited, constantinople, constantine, s, mother, zoe, returned, to, the, palace, on, the, insistence, of, the, young, emperor, and, immediately, proceeded, to, eliminate, the, regents, through, a, plot, she, managed, to, assume, power, in, february, 914, practically, removing, patriarch, nicholas, from, the, government, disowning, and, obscuring, his, recognition, of,

byzantine, throne, by, diplomatic, means, the, infuriated, simeon, once, again, had, to, wage, war, to, impose, his, will, between, 920, and, 922, bulgaria, increased, its, pressure, on, byzantium, campaigning, in, the, west, through, thessaly, reaching, the, isthmus, of, corinth, and, in, the, east, in, thrace, reaching, and, crossing, the, dardanelles, to, lay, siege, on, the, town, of,

the, alliance, however, the, envoys, were, captured, by, the, byzantines, at, calabria, romanos, offered, peace, to, egypt, under, the, fatimids, supplementing, this, offer, with, generous, gifts, and, ruined, the, fatimids, newly, formed, alliance, with, bulgaria, in, 924, simeon, sent, an, army, led, by, aslav, klonimirovi, to, depose, a, former, ally, of, his, zaharije, pribisavljevi, he, was, successful, as, zaharije, fled, to, croatia, in, the, summer, of, the, same, year, simeon, arrived, at, constantinople, and, demanded, to, see, the, patriarch, and, the, emperor, he, conversed, with, romanos, on, the, golden, horn, on, 9, september, 924, and, arranged, a, truce, according, to, which, byzantium, would, pay, bulgaria, an, annual, tax, but, would, be, ceded, back, some, cities, on, the, black, sea, coast, in, 926, simeon, s, troops, invaded, croatia, at, the, time, a, byzantine, ally, but, were, severely, defeated, by, the, army, of, king, tomislav, in, the, battle, of, the, bosnian, highlands, a, peace, was, mediated, by, the, papal, legate, madalbert, between, simeon, and, tomislav, though, the, army, he, sent, to, croatia, was, destroyed, simeon, retained, sufficient, military, forces, to, contemplate, renewed, aggression, against, the, byzantines, after, 14, years, of, war, simeon, was, ultimately, too, frustrated, in, his, designs, on, the, byzantine, throne, in, the, year, following, the, destruction, of, his, army, in, croatia, while, planning, another, attack, on, the, byzantines, he, died, of, a, heart, attack, in, his, palace, in, preslav, on, may, 27, 927, soon, after, his, accession, simeon, s, son, peter, i, renewed, the, war, and, raided, byzantine, thrace, following, this, show, of, strength, peter, dispatched, a, diplomatic, mission, to, constantinople, seeking, peace, a, peace, was, obtained, with, the, frontiers, restored, to, those, defined, in, treaties, of, 897, and, 904, simeon, s, conquests, in, thrace, were, restored, to, the, byzantine, empire, which, in, return, recognised, bulgarian, control, over, inland, macedonia, peter, also, gained, a, byzantine, bride, maria, lecapena, granddaughter, of, romanus, i, an, annual, tribute, and, recognition, of, his, title, of, tsar, and, of, the, autocephalus, status, of, the, bulgarian, church, this, peace, lasted, until, 966, after, peter, s, empress, died, in, the, mid, 960s, the, byzantine, emperor, nikephoros, ii, phokas, refused, to, pay, the, annual, tribute, to, bulgaria, in, 966, complaining, of, the, bulgarian, alliance, with, the, magyars, and, undertook, a, show, of, force, at, the, bulgarian, border, dissuaded, from, a, direct, attack, against, bulgaria, nikephoros, ii, dispatched, a, messenger, to, the, kievan, prince, sviatoslav, igorevich, to, arrange, a, kievan, attack, against, bulgaria, from, the, north, sviatoslav, readily, launched, a, campaign, with, a, vast, force, and, routed, the, bulgarians, on, the, danube, seizing, some, 80, bulgarian, fortresses, in, 968, stunned, by, the, success, of, his, ally, and, suspicious, of, his, actual, intentions, emperor, nikephoros, ii, now, hastened, to, make, peace, with, bulgaria, and, arranged, the, marriage, of, his, wards, the, underage, emperors, basil, ii, and, constantine, viii, to, two, bulgarian, princesses, two, of, peter, s, sons, were, sent, to, constantinople, as, both, negotiators, and, honorary, hostages, in, the, meantime, peter, managed, to, secure, the, retreat, of, the, kievan, forces, by, inciting, bulgaria, s, traditional, allies, the, pechenegs, to, attack, kiev, itself, in, 968, boris, ii, future, emperor, of, bulgaria, went, to, constantinople, again, to, negotiate, a, peace, settlement, with, emperor, nikephoros, ii, phokas, and, apparently, to, serve, as, an, honorary, hostage, this, arrangement, was, intended, to, put, an, end, to, the, conflict, between, bulgaria, and, byzantium, which, would, now, join, forces, against, prince, sviatoslav, i, of, kiev, whom, the, byzantine, emperor, had, pitted, against, the, bulgarians, in, 969, a, new, kievan, invasion, defeated, the, bulgarians, again, and, peter, i, abdicated, to, become, a, monk, in, circumstances, that, are, not, entirely, clear, boris, ii, was, allowed, to, return, to, bulgaria, and, sit, on, his, father, s, throne, boris, ii, was, unable, to, stem, the, kievan, advance, and, found, himself, forced, to, accept, sviatoslav, of, kiev, as, his, ally, and, puppet, master, turning, against, the, byzantines, a, kievan, campaign, into, byzantine, thrace, was, defeated, at, arcadiopolis, in, 970, and, the, new, byzantine, emperor, john, i, tzimiskes, advanced, northwards, failing, to, secure, the, defense, of, the, balkan, passes, sviatoslav, allowed, the, byzantines, to, penetrate, into, moesia, and, lay, siege, to, the, bulgarian, capital, preslav, although, bulgarians, and, russians, joined, in, defending, the, city, the, byzantines, managed, to, set, afire, the, wooden, structures, and, roofs, with, missiles, and, they, took, the, fortress, boris, ii, now, became, a, captive, of, john, i, tzimiskes, who, continued, to, pursue, the, russians, besieging, sviatoslav, in, dr, st, r, silistra, while, claiming, to, act, as, boris, ally, and, protector, and, treating, the, bulgarian, monarch, with, due, respect, after, sviatoslav, had, come, to, terms, and, set, out, for, kiev, the, byzantine, emperor, returned, to, constantinople, in, triumph, far, from, liberating, bulgaria, as, he, had, claimed, john, brought, along, boris, ii, and, his, family, together, with, the, contents, of, the, bulgarian, imperial, treasury, in, 971, in, a, public, ceremony, in, constantinople, boris, ii, was, ritually, divested, of, his, imperial, insignia, and, was, given, the, byzantine, court, title, of, magistros, as, compensation, the, bulgarian, lands, in, thrace, and, lower, moesia, now, became, part, of, the, byzantine, empire, and, were, placed, under, byzantine, governors, although, the, ceremony, in, 971, had, been, intended, as, a, symbolic, termination, of, the, bulgarian, empire, the, byzantines, were, unable, to, assert, their, control, over, the, western, provinces, of, bulgaria, these, remained, under, the, rule, of, their, own, governors, especially, a, noble, family, led, by, four, brothers, called, the, cometopuli, i, e, the, sons, of, the, count, named, david, moses, aron, and, samuel, the, movement, was, regarded, as, a, revolt, by, the, byzantine, emperor, but, it, apparently, saw, itself, as, a, sort, of, regency, for, the, captive, boris, ii, as, they, began, to, raid, neighboring, territories, under, byzantine, rule, the, byzantine, government, resorted, to, a, stratagem, intended, to, compromise, the, leadership, of, this, revolt, this, involved, allowing, boris, ii, and, his, brother, roman, to, escape, from, their, honorary, captivity, at, the, byzantine, court, in, the, hope, that, their, arrival, in, bulgaria, would, cause, a, division, between, the, cometopuli, and, other, bulgarian, leaders, as, the, brothers, entered, the, region, under, bulgarian, control, in, 977, boris, ii, dismounted, and, went, ahead, of, his, brother, mistaken, for, a, byzantine, noble, due, to, his, attire, boris, was, shot, in, the, chest, by, a, deaf, and, mute, border, patrol, roman, managed, to, identify, himself, to, the, other, guards, and, was, duly, accepted, as, emperor, however, since, he, was, a, eunuch, as, the, byzantines, had, castrated, him, so, that, he, could, not, have, any, heirs, he, was, unable, to, assume, the, throne, instead, the, youngest, of, the, cometopuli, brothers, samuel, resisted, the, byzantines, although, the, byzantines, eventually, managed, to, capture, all, of, bulgaria, samuel, resisted, basil, ii, for, decades, and, is, the, only, man, to, ever, defeat, him, in, battle, when, in, 986, samuel, drove, basil, ii, s, army, from, the, field, at, the, gates, of, trajan, and, the, emperor, barely, surviving, the, heavy, defeat, soon, turned, to, the, east, for, new, conquests, the, victory, by, samuel, prompted, pope, gregory, v, to, recognize, him, as, tsar, and, he, was, crowned, in, rome, in, 997, in, 1002, a, full, scale, war, broke, out, by, this, time, basil, s, army, was, stronger, and, the, emperor, was, determined, to, conquer, bulgaria, once, and, for, all, he, deployed, much, of, the, imperial, army, battle, seasoned, from, the, eastern, campaigns, against, the, arabs, and, samuel, was, forced, to, retreat, into, his, country, s, heartland, still, by, harassing, the, powerful, byzantine, army, samuel, hoped, to, force, basil, to, the, peace, table, for, a, dozen, years, his, tactics, maintained, bulgarian, independence, and, even, kept, basil, away, from, the, main, bulgarian, cities, including, the, capital, of, ohrid, on, july, 29, 1014, however, at, kleidion, or, belasitsa, present, day, blagoevgrad, province, basil, ii, was, able, to, corner, the, main, bulgarian, army, and, force, a, battle, while, samuel, was, away, he, won, a, crushing, victory, and, according, to, later, legend, he, blinded, 14, 000, prisoners, leaving, one, man, in, every, hundred, with, sight, in, one, eye, to, lead, his, comrades, home, according, to, the, legend, the, sight, of, this, atrocity, was, too, much, even, for, samuel, who, blamed, himself, for, the, defeat, and, died, less, than, three, months, later, on, october, 6, this, story, is, a, later, invention, which, gave, rise, to, the, nickname, by, which, basil, ii, was, known, from, the, 12th, century, onwards, the, bulgar, slayer, the, bulgarian, emperor, ivan, vladislav, restored, the, fortifications, of, bitola, in, 1015, and, survived, an, assassination, plot, undertaken, by, byzantine, agents, although, the, byzantines, sacked, ohrid, they, failed, to, take, pernik, and, received, troubling, intelligence, that, ivan, vladislav, was, attempting, to, induce, the, pechenegs, to, come, to, his, aid, following, up, the, general, practice, of, his, predecessors, while, byzantine, armies, had, penetrated, deep, into, bulgaria, in, 1016, ivan, vladislav, was, able, to, rally, his, forces, and, commenced, a, siege, of, dyrrachium, durazzo, in, the, winter, of, 1018, during, a, battle, in, front, of, the, city, ivan, vladislav, was, killed, after, his, death, much, of, the, bulgarian, nobility, and, court, including, his, widow, maria, and, his, sons, submitted, to, the, advancing, basil, ii, in, exchange, for, guarantees, of, the, preservation, of, their, lives, status, and, property, the, newly, proclaimed, bulgarian, emperor, peter, ii, later, led, a, large, revolt, against, the, byzantines, peter, ii, delyan, took, ni, and, skopje, first, co, opting, and, then, eliminating, another, potential, leader, in, the, person, of, one, tihomir, who, had, led, a, rebellion, in, the, region, of, durazzo, after, this, peter, ii, marched, on, thessalonica, where, the, byzantine, emperor, michael, iv, was, staying, michael, fled, leaving, his, treasury, to, a, certain, michael, ivac, probably, a, son, of, ivac, a, general, under, samuel, of, bulgaria, who, promptly, turned, over, the, bulk, of, the, treasury, to, peter, outside, the, city, thessalonica, remained, in, byzantine, hands, but, macedonia, durazzo, and, parts, of, northern, greece, were, taken, by, peter, ii, s, forces, this, inspired, further, slavic, revolts, against, byzantine, rule, in, epirus, and, albania, peter, ii, delyan, s, successes, ended, however, with, the, interference, of, his, cousin, alusian, whose, father, ivan, vladislav, had, murdered, peter, s, father, gavril, radomir, in, 1015, alusian, joined, peter, ii, s, ranks, as, an, apparent, deserter, from, the, byzantine, court, where, he, had, been, disgraced, and, was, welcomed, by, peter, ii, who, gave, him, an, army, to, attack, thessalonica, the, siege, was, raised, by, the, byzantines, however, and, the, army, was, defeated, alusian, barely, escaped, and, returned, to, ostrovo, one, night, in, 1041, during, dinner, alusian, took, advantage, of, peter, ii, s, inebriation, and, cut, off, his, nose, and, blinded, him, with, a, kitchen, knife, since, alusian, was, of, the, blood, of, samuel, he, was, quickly, proclaimed, emperor, in, place, of, peter, ii, by, his, troops, but, he, conspired, to, defect, to, the, byzantines, as, the, bulgarian, and, byzantine, troops, were, preparing, for, battle, alusian, deserted, to, the, enemy, and, headed, for, constantinople, where, his, possessions, and, lands, were, restored, to, him, and, he, was, rewarded, with, the, high, courtly, rank, of, magistros, meanwhile, though, blind, peter, ii, delyan, resumed, command, of, the, bulgarian, forces, but, the, byzantine, emperor, michael, iv, determined, to, take, advantage, of, the, situation, and, advanced, against, them, in, an, obscure, battle, near, ostrovo, the, byzantines, defeated, the, bulgarian, troops, and, peter, ii, delyan, was, captured, and, taken, to, constantinople, where, he, was, perhaps, executed, norse, sagas, refer, to, the, participation, of, the, future, norwegian, king, harald, hardr, da, who, allegedly, cut, down, peter, ii, in, the, field, of, battle, as, a, member, of, the, varangian, guard, this, tradition, may, be, supported, by, a, laconic, reference, in, the, so, called, bulgarian, apocryphal, chronicle, in, either, case, peter, ii, delyan, may, have, perished, in, 1041, the, troops, of, the, newly, crowned, peter, iii, took, ni, and, ohrid, but, suffered, a, crippling, defeat, in, front, of, kastoria, the, byzantine, counter, attack, took, skopje, with, the, help, of, georgi, voiteh, who, first, betrayed, peter, iii, and, then, attempted, to, betray, the, byzantines, but, in, vain, in, another, battle, peter, iii, was, taken, captive, by, the, byzantines, and, sent, together, with, georgi, voiteh, as, prisoners, to, constantinople, voiteh, died, en, route, while, the, former, peter, iii, languished, in, prison, first, at, constantinople, and, then, at, antioch, in, 1185, theodore, peter, iv, and, his, younger, brother, ivan, asen, appeared, before, the, byzantine, emperor, isaac, ii, angelos, at, kypsela, to, request, a, pronoia, but, their, request, was, dismissively, refused, and, ivan, asen, was, slapped, in, the, ensuing, argument, the, insulted, brothers, returned, home, to, moesia, and, taking, advantage, of, discontent, caused, by, the, heavy, taxation, imposed, by, the, byzantine, emperor, to, finance, his, campaigns, against, william, ii, of, sicily, and, to, celebrate, his, marriage, to, margaret, of, hungary, raised, a, revolt, against, byzantine, rule, the, rebellion, failed, to, immediately, capture, bulgaria, s, historic, capital, preslav, but, established, a, new, capital, city, at, t, rnovo, presumably, the, center, of, the, revolt, in, 1186, the, rebels, suffered, a, defeat, but, isaac, ii, angelos, failed, to, exploit, his, victory, and, returned, to, constantinople, with, the, help, of, the, chiefly, cuman, population, north, of, the, danube, peter, iv, and, ivan, asen, recovered, their, positions, and, raided, into, thrace, when, isaac, ii, angelos, penetrated, into, moesia, again, in, 1187, he, failed, to, capture, either, t, rnovo, or, love, and, he, signed, a, treaty, effectively, recognizing, the, second, bulgarian, empire, but, neither, side, had, any, intention, of, keeping, the, peace, when, the, third, crusade, led, by, frederick, i, the, holy, roman, emperor, was, advancing, towards, constantinople, representatives, of, peter, iv, and, ivan, asen, approached, him, with, offers, of, military, assistance, against, the, latently, hostile, isaac, ii, angelos, at, ni, and, again, at, adrianople, after, the, passing, of, the, third, crusade, isaac, ii, angelos, decided, to, deal, with, the, bulgarians, decisively, the, expedition, was, planned, on, a, grand, scale, and, reached, t, rnovo, before, besieging, it, for, a, protracted, period, by, this, time, peter, iv, had, crowned, ivan, asen, i, as, co, emperor, in, 1189, and, without, abdicating, retired, to, preslav, in, charge, of, the, defense, of, the, t, rnovo, ivan, asen, i, incited, the, byzantine, emperor, to, a, hasty, retreat, by, spreading, rumors, about, the, arrival, of, a, great, cuman, army, to, the, relief, of, the, besieged, city, the, retreating, byzantine, army, was, ambushed, by, ivan, asen, i, in, the, balkan, passes, and, isaac, ii, barely, escaped, with, his, life, in, 1190, success, now, definitely, swung, in, favor, of, the, bulgarians, who, captured, the, areas, of, sredec, sofia, and, ni, in, 1191, of, belgrade, in, 1195, of, melnik, and, prosek, in, 1196, while, raiding, parties, reached, as, far, south, as, serres, when, the, bulgarian, emperor, ivan, asen, i, was, murdered, his, successor, kaloyan, continued, an, aggressive, policy, against, the, byzantine, empire, by, making, an, alliance, with, ivanko, the, murderer, of, ivan, asen, i, who, had, entered, byzantine, service, in, 1196, and, had, become, governor, of, philippopolis, plovdiv, another, ally, of, kaloyan, was, dobromir, hriz, chrysos, who, governed, the, area, of, strumica, the, coalition, was, quickly, dissolved, as, the, byzantines, overcame, both, ivanko, and, dobromir, hriz, nevertheless, kaloyan, conquered, konstanteia, simeonovgrad, in, thrace, and, varna, from, the, byzantine, empire, in, 1201, and, most, of, slavic, macedonia, in, 1202, the, war, between, the, bulgarians, and, the, byzantines, was, stalled, in, 1204, when, catholic, forces, of, the, fourth, crusade, captured, and, sacked, constantinople, and, created, the, latin, empire, electing, as, emperor, baldwin, i, of, flanders, although, kaloyan, had, offered, the, crusaders, an, alliance, against, the, byzantine, empire, his, offer, had, been, spurned, and, the, latin, empire, expressed, the, intention, of, conquering, all, the, lands, of, the, former, byzantine, empire, including, the, territories, ruled, by, kaloyan, the, impending, conflict, was, precipitated, by, the, byzantine, aristocracy, in, thrace, which, rebelled, against, latin, rule, in, 1205, and, called, on, kaloyan, for, help, offering, him, its, submission, although, during, the, period, of, time, from, 1204, to, 1261, the, bulgarians, and, the, byzantines, mainly, fought, the, latins, both, still, held, resentment, towards, each, other, in, spite, of, the, initially, welcome, successes, of, the, bulgarians, against, the, latins, the, byzantine, aristocracy, now, began, to, rebel, or, conspire, against, its, rule, kaloyan, also, changed, course, and, turned, mercilessly, on, his, former, allies, adopting, the, sobriquet, r, maioktonos, slayer, of, romans, as, a, counter, derivative, from, basil, ii, s, boulgaroktonos, slayer, of, bulgarians, tsar, ivan, asen, ii, reign, 1218, to, 1241, tried, to, achieve, the, regency, for, the, 11, year, old, latin, emperor, baldwin, ii, after, 1228, but, the, latin, aristocrats, did, not, support, ivan, asen, he, inflicted, a, crushing, defeat, on, theodore, komnenos, doukas, of, the, empire, of, thessalonica, in, the, battle, of, klokotnitsa, in, 1230, theodore, s, empire, soon, collapsed, and, ivan, asen, conquered, large, territories, in, macedonia, thessaly, and, thrace, but, generally, the, relations, between, the, bulgarians, and, nicaea, the, main, byzantine, successor, state, remained, strong, as, the, new, pro, nicaean, alignment, of, bulgaria, culminated, with, the, marriage, between, tsar, ivan, asen, ii, s, daughter, elena, and, the, future, theodore, ii, laskaris, the, son, of, emperor, john, iii, doukas, vatatzes, of, nicaea, the, dynastic, union, was, celebrated, in, 1235, and, coincided, with, the, restoration, of, the, bulgarian, patriarchate, with, the, consent, of, the, eastern, patriarchs, and, with, a, siege, of, constantinople, by, the, combined, forces, of, john, iii, and, ivan, asen, ii, later, on, the, bulgarians, decided, to, aid, neither, the, latin, empire, nor, the, nicaeans, because, both, were, too, involved, fighting, each, other, to, attack, bulgaria, during, 1240s, and, 1250s, the, emperors, john, iii, doukas, vatatzes, and, his, son, theodore, ii, laskaris, led, successful, campaigns, against, the, tsardom, soon, after, the, byzantine, empire, was, restored, under, michael, viii, palaiologos, he, became, involved, in, a, civil, war, in, bulgaria, michael, gave, his, support, for, ivan, asen, and, sent, several, byzantine, armies, to, assert, him, on, the, throne, ivailo, the, current, bulgarian, ruler, defeated, several, of, these, attempts, but, he, was, blockaded, for, three, months, in, dr, st, r, silistra, by, the, mongol, allies, of, the, byzantine, emperor, in, the, meantime, a, byzantine, force, besieged, the, bulgarian, capital, and, after, hearing, a, rumor, of, ivailo, s, death, in, battle, the, local, nobility, surrendered, and, accepted, ivan, asen, iii, as, emperor, in, 1279, shortly, after, this, still, in, 1279, ivailo, suddenly, appeared, before, t, rnovo, with, an, army, but, he, failed, to, take, the, well, fortified, city, he, nevertheless, defeated, a, larger, byzantine,

and, they, often, allied, with, each, other, to, ward, off, powerful, foes, such, as, the, golden, horde, and, the, turks, in, 1301, however, the, new, aggressive, bulgarian, emperor, theodore, svetoslav, had, several, bloody, encounters, with, the, byzantines, he, first, defeated, the, former, emperor, michael, asen, ii, who, unsuccessfully, tried, to, advance, into, bulgaria, with, a, byzantine, army, in, about, 1302, as, a, consequence, of, his, success, theodore, felt, secure, enough, to, take, the, offensive, by, 1303, and, captured, several, fortresses, in, northeastern, thrace, including, mesembria, neseb, r, ankhialos, pomorie, sozopolis, sozopol, and, agathopolis, ahtopol, in, the, following, year, the, byzantine, counter, attack, failed, at, the, battle, on, the,

turns, pillaging, each, other, s, lands, in, 1305, theodore, s, uncle, aldimir, seems, to, have, entered, into, some, sort, of, agreement, with, the, byzantines, and, theodore, svetoslav, annexed, his, lands, in, 1306, svetoslav, gained, the, services, of, the, rebellious, alans, who, had, previously, worked, as, mercenaries, for, the, byzantines, settling, them, in, bulgaria, and, he, made, unsuccessful, overtures, to, the, mercenaries, of, the, catalan, company, who, had, also, rebelled, against, their, byzantine, employers, the, war, ended, with, a, peace, treaty, in, 1307, cemented,

bulgarians, were, finally, defeated, by, andronikos, iii, the, byzantine, emperor, was, preparing, for, an, invasion, of, bulgaria, when, he, heard, the, news, that, george, terter, ii, had, died, apparently, of, natural, causes, the, death, of, george, terter, ii, was, followed, by, a, brief, period, of, confusion, and, uncertainty, which, was, exploited, by, the, byzantine, emperor, andronikos, iii, palaiologos, the, byzantines, overran, northeastern, thrace, and, captured, a, number, of, important, cities, at, the, same, time, a, byzantine, sponsored, pretender, vojsil, brother, of, the, former, bulgarian, emperor, smilec, ensconced, himself, in, kr, n, assuming, control, of, the, valley, between, the, balkan, mountains, and, sredna, gora, at, this, point, the, newly, elected, bulgarian, emperor, michael, asen, iii, marched, south, to, fight, andronikos, iii, while, another, byzantine, army, was, besieging, philippopolis, plovdiv, although, michael, asen, iii, managed, to, force, andronikos, iii, to, retreat, the, byzantines, managed, to, capture, philippopolis, while, the, bulgarians, were, changing, garrisons, in, spite, of, this, loss, michael, asen, iii, expelled, vojsil, and, recovered, control, over, northern, and, northeastern, thrace, in, 1324, the, status, quo, was, confirmed, by, a, peace, treaty, with, the, byzantine, empire, which, was, cemented, by, michael, asen, iii, s, marriage, to, theodora, palaiologina, the, sister, of, andronikos, iii, palaiologos, who, had, been, previously, married, to, theodore, svetoslav, of, bulgaria, in, 1327, michael, asen, iii, involved, himself, in, the, renewed, civil, war, in, the, byzantine, empire, taking, the, side, of, his, brother, in, law, andronikos, iii, while, his, grandfather, and, rival, andronikos, ii, obtained, the, support, of, the, serbian, king, stephen, de, anski, andronikos, iii, and, michael, asen, iii, met, and, concluded, an, aggressive, alliance, against, serbia,
