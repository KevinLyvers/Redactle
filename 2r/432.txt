in, many, periodizations, of, human, history, the, late, modern, period, followed, the, early, modern, period, it, began, around, 1800, and, depending, on, the, author, either, ended, with, the, beginning, of, contemporary, history, in, 1945, or, includes, the, contemporary, history, period, to, the, present, day, notable, historical, events, in, the, late, 18th, century, that, marked, the, transition, from, the, early, modern, period, to, the, late, modern, period, include, the, american, revolution, 1765, 91, french, revolution, 1789, 99, and, beginning, of, the, industrial, revolution, around, 1760, there, are, differing, approaches, to, defining, a, possible, end, or, conclusion, to, the, late, modern, period, or, indeed, whether, it, might, be, considered, to, have, concluded, at, all, if, that, period, is, indeed, concluded, then, there, are, various, options, for, how, to, label, the, subsequent, era, i, e, the, current, contemporary, era, as, described, below, additionally, the, late, modern, period, has, been, divided, into, various, smaller, periods, there, are, differing, opinions, and, approaches, on, which, time, periods, to, assert, in, doing, so, the, development, of, the, steam, engine, started, the, industrial, revolution, in, great, britain, the, steam, engine, was, created, to, pump, water, from, coal, mines, enabling, them, to, be, deepened, beyond, groundwater, levels, the, date, of, the, industrial, revolution, is, not, exact, but, some, studies, suggest, it, occurred, after, the, east, india, company, s, conquests, of, mughal, bengal, kingdom, of, mysore, and, the, rest, of, india, which, were, already, observing, the, proto, industrialization, eric, hobsbawm, held, that, it, broke, out, in, the, 1780s, and, was, not, fully, felt, until, the, 1830s, or, 1840s, while, t, s, ashton, held, that, it, occurred, roughly, between, 1760, and, 1830, in, effect, the, reigns, of, george, iii, the, regency, and, george, iv, historians, define, the, 19th, century, historical, era, as, stretching, from, 1815, the, congress, of, vienna, to, 1914, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, alternatively, eric, hobsbawm, defined, the, long, nineteenth, century, as, spanning, the, years, 1789, to, 1914, in, the, 1800s, and, early, 1900s, the, great, and, powerful, spanish, portuguese, ottoman, and, mughal, empires, began, to, break, apart, spain, which, was, at, one, time, unrivaled, in, europe, had, been, declining, for, a, long, time, when, it, was, crippled, by, napoleon, bonaparte, s, invasion, the, ottoman, empire, was, wracked, with, a, series, of, revolutions, resulting, with, the, ottoman, s, only, holding, a, small, region, that, surrounded, the, capital, istanbul, the, mughal, empire, which, was, descended, from, the, mongol, khanate, was, bested, by, the, upcoming, maratha, confederacy, all, was, going, well, for, the, marathas, until, the, british, took, an, interest, in, the, riches, of, india, and, the, british, ended, up, ruling, not, just, the, boundaries, of, modern, india, but, also, pakistan, burma, nepal, bangladesh, and, some, southern, regions, of, afghanistan, portugal, s, vast, territory, of, brazil, reformed, into, the, independent, empire, of, brazil, with, the, defeat, of, napoleonic, france, britain, became, undoubtedly, the, most, powerful, country, in, the, world, and, by, the, end, of, the, first, world, war, controlled, a, quarter, of, the, world, s, population, and, a, third, of, its, surface, however, the, power, of, the, british, empire, did, not, end, on, land, since, it, had, the, greatest, navy, on, the, planet, electricity, steel, and, petroleum, enabled, germany, to, become, a, great, international, power, that, raced, to, create, empires,

colonizers, in, late, 18th, and, early, to, mid, 19th, centuries, the, spanish, american, wars, of, independence, lasted, from, 1808, until, 1829, directly, related, to, the, napoleonic, french, invasion, of, spain, the, conflict, started, with, short, lived, governing, juntas, established, in, chuquisaca, and, quito, opposing, the, composition, of, the, supreme, central, junta, of, seville, when, the, central, junta, fell, to, the, french, numerous, new, juntas, appeared, all, across, the, americas, eventually, resulting, in, a, chain, of, newly, independent, countries, stretching, from, argentina, and, chile, in, the, south, to, mexico, in, the, north, after, the, death, of, the, king, ferdinand, vii, in, 1833, only, cuba, and, puerto, rico, remained, under, spanish, rule, until, the, spanish, american, war, in, 1898, unlike, the, spanish, the, portuguese, did, not, divide, their, colonial, territory, in, america, the, captaincies, they, created, were, subdued, to, a, centralized, administration, in, salvador, later, relocated, to, rio, de, janeiro, which, reported, directly, to, the, portuguese, crown, until, its, independence, in, 1822, becoming, the, empire, of, brazil, the, meiji, restoration, was, a, chain, of, events, that, led, to, enormous, changes, in, japan, s, political, and, social, structure, that, was, taking, a, firm, hold, at, the, beginning, of, the, meiji, era, which, coincided, the, opening, of, japan, by, the, arrival, of, the, black, ships, of, commodore, matthew, perry, and, made, imperial, japan, a, great, power, russia, and, qing,

19th, century, and, faced, with, international, pressure, massive, rebellions, and, defeats, in, wars, the, dynasty, declined, after, the, mid, 19th, century, european, powers, controlled, parts, of, oceania, with, french, new, caledonia, from, 1853, and, french, polynesia, from, 1889, the, germans, established, colonies, in, new, guinea, in, 1884, and, samoa, in, 1900, the, united, states, expanded, into, the, pacific, with, hawaii, becoming, a, u, s, territory, from, 1898, disagreements, between, the, us, germany, and, uk, over, samoa, led, to, the, tripartite, convention, of, 1899, the, victorian, era, of, the, united, kingdom, was, the, period, of, queen, victoria, s, reign, from, june, 1837, to, january, 1901, this, was, a, long, period, of, prosperity, for, the, british, people, as, profits, gained, from, the, overseas, british, empire, as, well, as, from, industrial, improvements, at, home, allowed, a, large, educated, middle, class, to, develop, some, scholars, would, extend, the, beginning, of, the, period, as, defined, by, a, variety, of, sensibilities, and, political, games, that, have, come, to, be, associated, with, the, victorians, back, five, years,

alongside, the, formal, control, it, exerted, over, its, own, colonies, britain, s, dominant, position, in, world, trade, meant, that, it, effectively, controlled, the, economies, of, many, nominally, independent, countries, such, as, china, argentina, and, siam, which, has, been, generally, characterized, as, informal, empire, of, note, during, this, time, was, the, anglo, zulu, war, which, was, fought, in, 1879, between, the, british, empire, and, the, zulu, empire, british, imperial, strength, was, underpinned, by, the, steamship, and, the, telegraph, new, technologies, invented, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, allowing, it, to, control, and, defend, the, empire, by, 1902, the, british, empire, was, linked, together, by, a, network, of, telegraph, cables, the, so, called, all, red, line, growing, until, 1922, around, 13, 000, 000, square, miles, 34, 000, 000, km, 2, of, territory, and, roughly, 458, million, people, were, added, to, the, british, empire, the, british, established, colonies, in, australia, in, 1788, new, zealand, in, 1840, and, fiji, in, 1872, with, much, of, oceania, becoming, part, of, the, british, empire, the, bourbon, restoration, followed, the, ousting, of, napoleon, i, of, france, in, 1814, the, allies, restored, the, bourbon, dynasty, to, the, french, throne, the, ensuing, period, is, called, the, restoration, following, french, usage, and, is, characterized, by, a, sharp, conservative, reaction, and, the, re, establishment, of, the, roman, catholic, church, as, a, power, in, french, politics, the, july, monarchy, was, a, period, of, liberal, constitutional, monarchy, in, france, under, king, louis, philippe, starting, with, the, july, revolution, or, three, glorious, days, of, 1830, and, ending, with, the, revolution, of, 1848, the, second, empire, was, the, imperial, bonapartist, regime, of, napoleon, iii, from, 1852, to, 1870, between, the, second, republic, and, the, third, republic, in, france, the, franco, prussian, war, was, a, conflict, between, france, and, prussia, while, prussia, was, backed, up, by, the, north, german, confederation, of, which, it, was, a, member, and, the, south, german, states, of, baden, w, rttemberg, and, bavaria, the, complete, prussian, and, german, victory, brought, about, the, final, unification, of, germany, under, king, wilhelm, i, of, prussia, it, also, marked, the, downfall, of, napoleon, iii, and, the, end, of, the, second, french, empire, which, was, replaced, by, the, third, republic, as, part, of, the, settlement, almost, all, of, the, territory, of, alsace, lorraine, was, taken, by, prussia, to, become, a, part, of, germany, which, it, would, retain, until, the, end, of, world, war, i, the, french, third, republic, was, the, republican, government, of, france, between, the, end, of, the, second, french, empire, following, the, defeat, of, louis, napol, on, in, the, franco, prussian, war, in, 1870, and, the, vichy, regime, after, the, invasion, of, france, by, the, german, third, reich, in, 1940, the, third, republic, endured, seventy, years, making, it, the, most, long, lasting, regime, in, france, since, the, collapse, of, the, ancien, r, gime, in, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, italian, unification, was, the, political, and, social, movement, that, annexed, different, states, of, the, italian, peninsula, into, the, single, state, of, italy, in, the, 19th, century, there, is, a, lack, of, consensus, on, the, exact, dates, for, the, beginning, and, the, end, of, this, period, but, many, scholars, agree, that, the, process, began, with, the, end, of, napoleonic, rule, and, the, congress, of, vienna, in, 1815, and, approximately, ended, with, the, franco, prussian, war, in, 1871, though, the, last, citt, irredente, did, not, join, the, kingdom, of, italy, until, after, world, war, i, slavery, was, greatly, reduced, around, the, world, in, the, 19th, century, following, a, successful, slave, revolt, in, haiti, britain, forced, the, barbary, pirates, to, halt, their, practice, of, kidnapping, and, enslaving, europeans, banned, slavery, throughout, its, domain, and, charged, its, navy, with, ending, the, global, slave, trade, slavery, was, then, abolished, in, russia, 1861, america, 1865, and, brazil, 1888, following, the, abolition, of, the, slave, trade, in, 1807, and, propelled, by, economic, exploitation, the, scramble, for, africa, was, initiated, formally, at, the, berlin, west, africa, conference, in, 1884, 1885, the, berlin, conference, attempted, to, avoid, war, among, the, european, powers, by, allowing, the, european, rival, countries, to, carve, up, the, continent, of, africa, into, national, colonies, africans, were, not, consulted, the, major, european, powers, laid, claim, to, the, areas, of, africa, where, they, could, exhibit, a, sphere, of, influence, over, the, area, these, claims, did, not, have, to, have, any, substantial, land, holdings, or, treaties, to, be, legitimate, the, european, power, that, demonstrated, its, control, over, a, territory, accepted, the, mandate, to, rule, that, region, as, a, national, colony, the, european, nation, that, held, the, claim, developed, and, benefited, from, their, colony, s, commercial, interests, without, having, to, fear, rival, european, competition, with, the, colonial, claim, came, the, underlying, assumption, that, the, european, power, that, exerted, control, would, use, its, mandate, to, offer, protection, and, provide, welfare, for, its, colonial, peoples, however, this, principle, remained, more, theory, than, practice, there, were, many, documented, instances, of, material, and, moral, conditions, deteriorating, for, native, africans, in, the, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, under, european, colonial, rule, to, the, point, where, the, colonial, experience, for, them, has, been, described, as, hell, on, earth, at, the, time, of, the, berlin, conference, africa, contained, one, fifth, of, the, world, s, population, living, in, one, quarter, of, the, world, s, land, area, however, from, europe, s, perspective, they, were, dividing, an, unknown, continent, european, countries, established, a, few, coastal, colonies, in, africa, by, the, mid, nineteenth, century, which, included, cape, colony, great, britain, angola, portugal, and, algeria, france, but, until, the, late, nineteenth, century, europe, largely, traded, with, free, african, states, without, feeling, the, need, for, territorial, possession, until, the, 1880s, most, of, africa, remained, uncharted, with, western, maps, from, the, period, generally, showing, blank, spaces, for, the, continent, s, interior, from, the, 1880s, to, 1914, the, european, powers, expanded, their, control, across, the, african, continent, competing, with, each, other, for, africa, s, land, and, resources, great, britain, controlled, various, colonial, holdings, in, east, africa, that, spanned, the, length, of, the, african, continent, from, egypt, in, the, north, to, south, africa, the, french, gained, major, ground, in, west, africa, and, the, portuguese, held, colonies, in, southern, africa, germany, italy, and, spain, established, a, small, number, of, colonies, at, various, points, throughout, the, continent, which, included, german, east, africa, tanganyika, and, german, southwest, africa, for, germany, eritrea, and, libya, for, italy, and, the, canary, islands, and, rio, de, oro, in, northwestern, africa, for, spain, finally, for, king, leopold, ruled, from, 1865, to, 1909, there, was, the, large, piece, of, that, great, african, cake, known, as, the, congo, which, became, his, personal, fiefdom, by, 1914, almost, the, entire, continent, was, under, european, control, liberia, which, was, settled, by, freed, american, slaves, in, the, 1820s, and, abyssinia, ethiopia, in, eastern, africa, were, the, last, remaining, independent, african, states, around, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, and, into, the, 20th, century, the, meiji, era, occurred, during, the, reign, of, the, meiji, emperor, during, this, time, japan, started, its, modernization, and, rose, to, world, power, status, this, era, name, means, enlightened, rule, in, japan, the, meiji, restoration, started, in, the, 1860s, marking, the, rapid, modernization, by, the, japanese, themselves, along, european, lines, much, research, has, focused, on, the, issues, of, discontinuity, versus, continuity, with, the, previous, tokugawa, period, it, was, not, until, the, beginning, of, the, meiji, era, that, the, japanese, government, began, taking, modernization, seriously, japan, expanded, its, military, production, base, by, opening, arsenals, in, various, locations, the, hyobusho, war, office, was, replaced, with, a, war, department, and, a, naval, department, the, samurai, class, suffered, great, disappointment, the, following, years, laws, were, instituted, that, required, every, able, bodied, male, japanese, citizen, regardless, of, class, to, serve, a, mandatory, term, of, three, years, with, the, first, reserves, and, two, additional, years, with, the, second, reserves, this, action, the, deathblow, for, the, samurai, warriors, and, their, daimy, s, initially, met, resistance, from, both, the, peasant, and, warrior, alike, the, peasant, class, interpreted, the, term, for, military, service, ketsu, eki, blood, tax, literally, and, attempted, to, avoid, service, by, any, means, necessary, the, japanese, government, began, modelling, their, ground, forces, after, the, french, military, the, french, government, contributed, greatly, to, the, training, of, japanese, officers, many, were, employed, at, the, military, academy, in, kyoto, and, many, more, still, were, feverishly, translating, french, field, manuals, for, use, in, the, japanese, ranks, japan, s, modernized, military, gave, japan, the, opportunity, to, engage, in, imperialism, with, its, victory, against, the, qing, empire, in, the, first, sino, japanese, war, japan, annexed, taiwan, korea, and, the, chinese, province, of, shandong, after, the, death, of, the, meiji, emperor, the, taish, emperor, took, the, throne, the, taish, period, was, a, time, of, democratic, reform, granting, democratic, rights, to, all, japanese, men, foreigners, would, be, instrumental, in, aiding, in, japan, s, modernization, a, key, foreign, observer, of, the, remarkable, and, rapid, changes, in, japanese, society, in, this, period, was, ernest, mason, satow, the, antebellum, age, was, a, period, of, increasing, division, in, the, country, based, on, the, growth, of, slavery, in, the, american, south, and, in, the, western, territories, of, kansas, and, nebraska, that, eventually, led, to, the, civil, war, in, 1861, the, antebellum, period, is, often, considered, to, have, begun, with, the, kansas, nebraska, act, of, 1854, although, it, may, have, begun, as, early, as, 1812, this, period, is, also, significant, because, it, marked, the, transition, of, american, manufacturing, to, the, industrial, revolution, manifest, destiny, was, the, belief, that, the, united, states, was, destined, to, expand, across, the, north, american, continent, from, the, atlantic, seaboard, to, the, pacific, ocean, during, this, time, the, united, states, expanded, to, the, pacific, ocean, from, sea, to, shining, sea, largely, defining, the, borders, of, the, contiguous, united, states, as, they, are, today, the, american, civil, war, began, when, seven, southern, slave, states, declared, their, secession, from, the, u, s, and, formed, the, confederate, states, of, america, the, confederacy, four, more, states, joined, the, confederacy, later, led, by, jefferson, davis, they, fought, against, the, u, s, federal, government, the, union, under, president, abraham, lincoln, which, was, supported, by, all, the, free, states, and, the, five, border, slave, states, in, the, north, northern, leaders, agreed, that, victory, would, require, more, than, the, end, of, fighting, secession, and, confederate, nationalism, had, to, be, totally, repudiated, and, all, forms, of, slavery, or, quasi, slavery, had, to, be, eliminated, lincoln, proved, effective, in, mobilizing, support, for, the, war, goals, raising, large, armies, and, supplying, them, avoiding, foreign, interference, and, making, the, end, of, slavery, a, war, goal, the, confederacy, had, a, larger, area, than, it, could, defend, and, it, failed, to, keep, its, ports, open, and, its, rivers, clear, as, was, the, case, in, the, battle, of, vicksburg, the, north, kept, up, the, pressure, as, the, south, could, barely, feed, and, clothe, its, soldiers, its, soldiers, especially, those, in, the, east, under, the, command, of, general, robert, e, lee, proved, highly, resourceful, until, they, finally, were, overwhelmed, by, generals, ulysses, s, grant, and, william, t, sherman, in, 1864, 65, the, reconstruction, era, 1863, 77, began, with, the, emancipation, proclamation, in, 1863, and, included, freedom, full, citizenship, and, voting, rights, for, southern, blacks, it, was, followed, by, a, reaction, that, left, the, blacks, in, a, second, class, status, legally, politically, socially, and, economically, until, the, 1960s, during, the, gilded, age, there, was, substantial, growth, in, population, in, the, united, states, and, extravagant, displays, of, wealth, and, excess, of, america, s, upper, class, during, the, post, civil, war, and, post, reconstruction, era, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, wealth, polarization, derived, primarily, from, industrial, and, population, expansion, the, businessmen, of, the, second, industrial, revolution, created, industrial, towns, and, cities, in, the, northeast, with, new, factories, and, contributed, to, the, creation, of, an, ethnically, diverse, industrial, working, class, which, produced, the, wealth, owned, by, rising, super, rich, industrialists, and, financiers, called, the, robber, barons, an, example, is, the, company, of, john, d, rockefeller, who, was, an, important, figure, in, shaping, the, new, oil, industry, using, highly, effective, tactics, and, aggressive, practices, later, widely, criticized, standard, oil, absorbed, or, destroyed, most, of, its, competition, the, creation, of, a, modern, industrial, economy, took, place, with, the, creation, of, a, transportation, and, communication, infrastructure, the, corporation, became, the, dominant, form, of, business, organization, and, a, managerial, revolution, transformed, business, operations, in, 1890, congress, passed, the, sherman, antitrust, act, the, source, of, all, american, anti, monopoly, laws, the, law, forbade, every, contract, scheme, deal, or, conspiracy, to, restrain, trade, though, the, phrase, restraint, of, trade, remained, subjective, by, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, per, capita, income, and, industrial, production, in, the, united, states, exceeded, that, of, any, other, country, except, britain, long, hours, and, hazardous, working, conditions, led, many, workers, to, attempt, to, form, labor, unions, despite, strong, opposition, from, industrialists, and, the, courts, but, the, courts, did, protect, the, marketplace, declaring, the, standard, oil, group, to, be, an, unreasonable, monopoly, under, the, sherman, antitrust, act, in, 1911, it, ordered, standard, to, break, up, into, 34, independent, companies, with, different, boards, of, directors, replacing, the, classical, physics, in, use, since, the, end, of, the, scientific, revolution, modern, physics, arose, in, the, early, 20th, century, with, the, advent, of, quantum, physics, substituting, mathematical, studies, for, experimental, studies, and, examining, equations, to, build, a, theoretical, structure, the, old, quantum, theory, was, a, collection, of, results, which, predate, modern, quantum, mechanics, but, were, never, complete, or, self, consistent, the, collection, of, heuristic, prescriptions, for, quantum, mechanics, were, the, first, corrections, to, classical, mechanics, outside, the, realm, of, quantum, physics, the, various, aether, theories, in, classical, physics, which, supposed, a, fifth, element, such, as, the, luminiferous, aether, were, nullified, by, the, michelson, morley, experiment, an, attempt, to, detect, the, motion, of, earth, through, the, aether, in, biology, darwinism, gained, acceptance, promoting, the, concept, of, adaptation, in, the, theory, of, natural, selection, the, fields, of, geology, astronomy, and, psychology, also, made, strides, and, gained, new, insights, in, medicine, there, were, advances, in, medical, theory, and, treatments, starting, one, hundred, years, before, the, 20th, century, the, enlightenment, philosophy, was, challenged, in, various, quarters, around, the, 1900s, developed, from, earlier, secular, traditions, modern, humanist, ethical, philosophies, affirmed, the, dignity, and, worth, of, all, people, based, on, the, ability, to, determine, right, and, wrong, by, appealing, to, universal, human, qualities, particularly, rationality, without, resorting, to, the, supernatural, or, alleged, divine, authority, from, religious, texts, for, liberal, humanists, such, as, rousseau, and, kant, the, universal, law, of, reason, guided, the, way, toward, total, emancipation, from, any, kind, of, tyranny, these, ideas, were, challenged, for, example, by, the, young, karl, marx, who, criticized, the, project, of, political, emancipation, embodied, in, the, form, of, human, rights, asserting, it, to, be, symptomatic, of, the, very, dehumanization, it, was, supposed, to, oppose, for, friedrich, nietzsche, humanism, was, nothing, more, than, a, secular, version, of, theism, in, his, genealogy, of, morals, he, argues, that, human, rights, exist, as, a, means, for, the, weak, to, collectively, constrain, the, strong, on, this, view, such, rights, do, not, facilitate, emancipation, of, life, but, rather, deny, it, in, the, 20th, century, the, notion, that, human, beings, are, rationally, autonomous, was, challenged, by, the, concept, that, humans, were, driven, by, unconscious, irrational, desires, sigmund, freud, is, renowned, for, his, redefinition, of, sexual, desire, as, the, primary, motivational, energy, of, human, life, as, well, as, his, therapeutic, techniques, including, the, use, of, free, association, his, theory, of,

the, left, or, right, in, some, world, states, the, desperate, citizens, turned, toward, nationalist, demagogues, the, most, infamous, being, adolf, hitler, setting, the, stage, for, the, next, era, of, war, the, convulsion, brought, on, by, the, worldwide, depression, resulted, in, the, rise, of, nazism, in, asia, japan, became, an, ever, more, assertive, power, especially, with, regards, to, china, the, interwar, period, was, also, marked, by, a, radical, change, in, the, international, order, away, from, the, balance, of, power, that, had, dominated, pre, world, war, i, europe, one, main, institution, that, was, meant, to, bring, stability, was, the, league, of, nations, which, was, created, after, the, first, world, war, with, the, intention, of, maintaining, world, security, and, peace, and, encouraging, economic, growth, between, member, countries, however, the, league, failed, to, resolve, any, major, crises, and, by, 1938, it, was, no, longer, a, major, player, the, league, was, undermined, by, the, bellicosity, of, nazi, germany, imperial, japan, the, soviet, union, and, mussolini, s, italy, and, by, the, non, participation, of, the, united, states, a, series, of, international, crises, strained, the, league, to, its, limits, the, earliest, being, the, invasion, of, manchuria, by, japan, and, the, abyssinian, crisis, of, 1935, 36, in, which, italy, invaded, abyssinia, one, of, the, only, free, african, nations, at, that, time, the, league, tried, to, enforce, economic, sanctions, upon, italy, but, to, no, avail, the, incident, highlighted, french, and, british, weakness, exemplified, by, their, reluctance, to, alienate, italy, and, lose, her, as, their, ally, the, limited, actions, taken, by, the, western, powers, pushed, mussolini, s, italy, towards, alliance, with, hitler, s, germany, anyway, the, abyssinian, war, showed, hitler, how, weak, the, league, was, and, encouraged, the, remilitarization, of, the, rhineland, in, flagrant, disregard, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, this, was, the, first, in, a, series, of, provocative, acts, culminating, in, the, invasion, of, poland, in, september, 1939, and, the, beginning, of, the, second, world, war, facing, resource, scarcity, due, to, a, growing, population, japan, seized, manchuria, in, september, 1931, and, put, ex, qing, emperor, puyi, in, charge, as, head, of, the, puppet, state, of, manchukuo, in, 1932, during, the, sino, japanese, war, 1937, 1945, the, loss, of, manchuria, and, its, vast, potential, for, military, industrial, development, was, a, blow, to, the, chinese, economy, after, 1940, conflicts, between, the, kuomintang, and, communists, became, more, frequent, in, the, areas, not, under, japanese, control, the, communists, expanded, their, influence, wherever, opportunities, presented, themselves, through, mass, organizations, administrative, reforms, and, the, land, and, tax, reform, measures, favoring, the, peasants, while, the, kuomintang, attempted, to, neutralize, the, spread, of, communist, influence, the, second, sino, japanese, war, had, seen, tensions, rise, between, imperial, japan, and, the, united, states, events, such, as, the, panay, incident, and, the, nanjing, massacre, turned, american, public, opinion, against, japan, with, the, occupation, of, french, indochina, in, the, years, of, 1940, 41, and, with, the, continuing, war, in, china, the, united, states, placed, a, metal, and, oil, embargo, on, japan, which, were, vital, to, its, war, effort, the, japanese, were, faced, with, the, option, of, either, withdrawing, from, china, or, seizing, and, securing, new, sources, of, raw, materials, in, the, resource, rich, european, controlled, colonies, of, southeast, asia, specifically, british, malaya, and, the, dutch, east, indies, modern, day, indonesia, although, japan, had, invaded, china, in, 1937, the, conventional, view, is, that, the, world, war, ii, began, on, september, 1, 1939, when, nazi, germany, invaded, poland, within, two, days, the, united, kingdom, and, france, declared, war, on, germany, even, though, the, fighting, was, confined, to, poland, pursuant, to, a, then, secret, provision, of, its, non, aggression, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, the, soviet, union, joined, germany, on, september, 17, 1939, to, conquer, poland, and, divide, eastern, europe, the, allies, were, initially, made, up, of, poland, the, united, kingdom, france, australia, canada, new, zealand, south, africa, as, well, as, british, commonwealth, countries, which, were, controlled, directly, by, the, uk, such, as, the, indian, empire, all, of, these, countries, declared, war, on, germany, in, september, 1939, following, the, lull, in, fighting, known, as, the, phoney, war, germany, invaded, western, europe, in, may, 1940, six, weeks, later, france, in, the, meantime, attacked, by, italy, as, well, surrendered, to, germany, which, then, tried, unsuccessfully, to, conquer, britain, on, september, 27, germany, italy, and, japan, signed, a, mutual, defense, agreement, the, tripartite, pact, and, were, known, as, the, axis, powers, nine, months, later, on, june, 22, 1941, germany, launched, a, massive, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, which, prompt, it, to, join, the, allies, germany, was, now, engaged, in, fighting, a, war, on, two, fronts, this, proved, to, be, a, mistake, germany, had, not, successfully, carried, out, the, invasion, of, britain, and, the, war, turned, against, the, axis, on, december, 7, 1941, japan, attacked, the, united, states, at, pearl, harbor, bringing, it, too, into, the, war, on, the, side, of, the, allies, china, also, joined, the, allies, as, did, most, of, the, rest, of, the, world, china, was, in, turmoil, at, the, time, and, attacked, japanese, armies, through, guerilla, type, warfare, by, the, beginning, of, 1942, the, alignment, of, the, major, combatants, were, as, follows, the, british, commonwealth, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, were, fighting, germany, and, italy, china, the, british, commonwealth, and, the, united, states, were, fighting, japan, the, united, kingdom, the, united, states, the, soviet, union, and, china, were, referred, as, a, trusteeship, of, the, powerful, during, the, world, war, ii, and, were, recognized, as, the, allied, big, four, in, declaration, by, united, nations, these, four, countries, were, considered, as, the, four, policemen, or, four, sheriffs, of, the, allies, power, and, primary, victors, of, world, war, ii, battles, raged, across, all, of, europe, in, the, north, atlantic, ocean, across, north, africa, throughout, southeast, asia, throughout, china, across, the, pacific, ocean, and, in, the, air, over, japan, italy, surrendered, in, september, 1943, and, was, split, into, a, northern, germany, occupied, puppet, state, and, an, allies, friendly, state, in, the, south, germany, surrendered, in, may, 1945, following, the, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, japan, surrendered, marking, the, end, of, the, war, on, september, 2, 1945, it, is, possible, that, around, 62, million, people, died, in, the, war, estimates, vary, greatly, about, 60, of, all, casualties, were, civilians, who, died, as, a, result, of, disease, starvation, genocide, in, particular, the, holocaust, and, aerial, bombings, the, soviet, union, and, china, suffered, the, most, casualties, estimates, place, deaths, in, the, soviet, union, at, around, 23, million, while, china, suffered, about, 10, million, no, country, lost, a, greater, portion, of, its, population, than, poland, approximately, 5, 6, million, or, 16, of, its, pre, war, population, of, 34, 8, million, died, the, holocaust, which, roughly, means, burnt, whole, was, the, deliberate, and, systematic, murder, of, millions, of, jews, and, other, unwanted, during, world, war, ii, by, the, nazi, regime, in, germany, several, differing, views, exist, regarding, whether, it, was, intended, to, occur, from, the, war, s, beginning, or, if, the, plans, for, it, came, about, later, regardless, persecution, of, jews, extended, well, before, the, war, even, started, such, as, in, the, kristallnacht, night, of, broken, glass, the, nazis, used, propaganda, to, great, effect, to, stir, up, anti, semitic, feelings, within, ordinary, germans, over, the, course, of, the, 20th, century, the, world, s, per, capita, gross, domestic, product, grew, by, a, factor, of, five, much, more, than, all, earlier, centuries, combined, including, the, 19th, with, its, industrial, revolution, many, economists, made, the, case, that, this, understated, the, magnitude, of, growth, as, many, of, the, goods, and, services, consumed, at, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, such, as, improved, medicine, causing, world, life, expectancy, to, increase, by, more, than, two, decades, and, communications, technologies, were, not, available, at, any, price, at, its, inception, however, the, gulf, between, the, world, s, rich, and, poor, grew, wider, and, the, majority, of, the, global, population, remained, in, the, poor, side, of, the, divide, in, latin, america, in, the, 1970s, leftists, acquired, a, significant, political, influence, which, prompted, the, right, wing, ecclesiastical, authorities, and, a, large, portion, of, the, individual, country, s, upper, class, to, support, coups, d, tat, to, avoid, what, they, perceived, as, a, communist, threat, this, was, further, fueled, by, cuban, and, united, states, intervention, which, led, to, a, political, polarization, most, south, american, countries, were, in, some, periods, ruled, by, military, dictatorships, that, were, supported, by, the, united, states, of, america, in, the, 1970s, the, regimes, of, the, southern, cone, collaborated, in, operation, condor, killing, many, leftist, dissidents, including, some, urban, guerrillas, the, information, age, began, in, the, mid, 20th, century, characterized, by, a, rapid, epochal, shift, from, the, traditional, industry, established, by, the, industrial, revolution, to, an, economy, primarily, based, upon, information, technology, the, onset, of, the, information, age, can, be, associated, with, the, development, of, transistor, technology, particularly, the, mosfet, metal, oxide, semiconductor, field, effect, transistor, which, became, the, fundamental, building, block, of, digital, electronics, and, revolutionized, modern, technology, according, to, the, united, nations, public, administration, network, the, information, age, was, formed, by, capitalizing, on, computer, microminiaturization, advances, which, upon, broader, usage, within, society, would, lead, to, modernized, information, and, to, communication, processes, becoming, the, driving, force, of, social, evolution
