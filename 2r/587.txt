however, rebelling, units, in, almost, all, important, cities, such, as, madrid, barcelona, valencia, bilbao, murcia, and, almer, a, did, not, gain, control, those, cities, remained, in, the, hands, of, the, government, leaving, spain, militarily, and, politically, divided, the, nationalists, and, the, republican, government, fought, for, control, of, the, country, the, nationalist, forces, received, munitions, soldiers, and, air, support, from, fascist, italy, and, nazi, germany, while, the, republican, side, received, support, from, the, soviet, union, and, mexico, other, countries, such, as, the, united, kingdom, france, and, the, united, states, continued, to, recognise, the, republican, government, but, followed, an, official, policy, of, non, intervention, despite, this, policy, tens, of, thousands, of, citizens, from, non, interventionist, countries, directly, participated, in, the, conflict, they, fought, mostly, in, the, pro, republican, international, brigades, which, also, included, several, thousand, exiles, from, pro, nationalist, regimes, smaller, numbers, of, pro, republican, international, volunteer, fighters, fought, in, the, poum, the, cnt, and, the,

of, the, nationalist, side, the, nationalists, advanced, from, their, strongholds, in, the, south, and, west, capturing, most, of, spain, s, northern, coastline, in, 1937, they, also, besieged, madrid, and, the, area, to, its, south, and, west, for, much, of, the, war, after, much, of, catalonia, was, captured, in, 1938, and, 1939, and, madrid, cut, off, from, barcelona, the, republican, military, position, became, hopeless, following, the, fall, without, resistance, of, barcelona, in, january, 1939, the, francoist, regime, was, recognised, by, france, and, the, united, kingdom, in, february, 1939, on, 5, march, 1939, in, response, to, an, alleged, increasing, communist, dominance, of, the, republican, government, and, the, deteriorating, military, situation, colonel, segismundo, casado, led, a, military, coup, against, the, republican, government, intending, to, seek, peace, with, the, nationalists, these, peace, overtures, however, were, rejected, by, franco, following, internal, conflict, between, republican, factions, in, madrid, in, the, same, month, franco, entered, the, capital, and, declared, victory, on, 1, april, 1939, hundreds, of, thousands, of, spaniards, fled, to, refugee, camps, in, southern, france, those, associated, with, the, losing, republicans, who, stayed, were, persecuted, by, the, victorious, nationalists, franco, established, a, dictatorship, in, which, all, right, wing, parties, were, fused, into, the, structure, of, his, regime, the, war, became, notable, for, the, passion, and, political, division, it, inspired, worldwide, and, for, the, many, atrocities, that, occurred, organised, purges, occurred, in, territory, captured, by, franco, s, forces, so, they, could, consolidate, their, future, regime, mass, executions, on, a, lesser, scale, also, took, place, in, areas, controlled, by, the, republicans, with, the, participation, of, local, authorities, varying, from, location, to, location, the, 19th, century, was, a, turbulent, time, for, spain, those, in, favour, of, reforming, the, spanish, government, vied, for, political, power, with, conservatives, who, intended, to, prevent, such, reforms, from, being, implemented, in, a, tradition, that, started, with, the, spanish, constitution, of, 1812, many, liberals, sought, to, curtail, the, authority, of, the, spanish, monarchy, as, well, as, to, establish, a, nation, state, under, the, ideology, and, philosophy, that, they, believed, in, the, reforms, of, 1812, were, short, lived, as, they, were, almost, immediately, overturned, by, king, ferdinand, vii, when, he, dissolved, the, aforementioned, constitution, this, ended, the, trienio, liberal, government, twelve, successful, coups, were, carried, out, between, 1814, and, 1874, there, were, several, attempts, to, realign, the, political, system, to, match, social, reality, until, the, 1850s, the, economy, of, spain, was, primarily, based, on, agriculture, there, was, little, development, of, a, bourgeois, industrial, or, commercial, class, the, land, based, oligarchy, remained, powerful, a, small, number, of, people, held, large, estates, called, latifundia, as, well, as, all, of, the, important, positions, in, government, in, addition, to, these, regime, changes, and, hierarchies, there, were, a, series, of, civil, wars, that, transpired, in, spain, known, as, the, carlist, wars, throughout, the, middle, of, the, century, there, were, three, such, wars, the, first, carlist, war, 1833, 1840, the, second, carlist, war, 1846, 1849, and, the, third, carlist, war, 1872, 1876, during, these, wars, a, right, wing, political, movement, known, as, carlism, fought, to, institute, a, monarchial, dynasty, under, a, different, branch, of, the, house, of, bourbon, descended, from, don, infante, carlos, mar, a, isidro, of, molina, in, 1868, popular, uprisings, led, to, the, overthrow, of, queen, isabella, ii, of, the, house, of, bourbon, two, distinct, factors, led, to, the, uprisings, a, series, of, urban, riots, and, a, liberal, movement, within, the, middle, classes, and, the, military, led, by, general, joan, prim, which, was, concerned, about, the, ultra, conservatism, of, the, monarchy, in, 1873, isabella, s, replacement, king, amadeo, i, of, the, house, of, savoy, abdicated, due, to, increasing, political, pressure, and, the, short, lived, first, spanish, republic, was, proclaimed, the, republic, was, marred, with, political, instability, and, conflicts, and, was, quickly, overthrown, by, a, coup, d, tat, by, general, arsenio, mart, nez, campos, in, december, 1874, after, which, the, bourbons, were, restored, to, the, throne, in, the, figure, of, alfonso, xii, isabella, s, son, after, the, restoration, carlists, and, anarchists, emerged, in, opposition, to, the, monarchy, alejandro, lerroux, spanish, politician, and, leader, of, the, radical, republican, party, helped, to, bring, republicanism, to, the, fore, in, catalonia, a, region, of, spain, with, its, own, cultural, and, societal, identity, in, which, poverty, was, particularly, acute, at, the, time, conscription, was, a, controversial, policy, that, was, eventually, implemented, by, the, government, of, spain, as, evidenced, by, the, tragic, week, in, 1909, resentment, and, resistance, were, factors, that, continued, well, into, the, 20th, century, spain, was, neutral, in, world, war, i, following, the, war, wide, swathes, of, spanish, society, including, the, armed, forces, united, in, hopes, of, removing, the, corrupt, central, government, of, the, country, in, madrid, but, these, circles, were, ultimately, unsuccessful, popular, perception, of, communism, as, a, major, threat, significantly, increased, during, this, period, in, 1923, a, military, coup, brought, miguel, primo, de, rivera, to, power, as, a, result, spain, transitioned, to, government, by, military, dictatorship, support, for, the, rivera, regime, gradually, faded, and, he, resigned, in, january, 1930, he, was, replaced, by, general, d, maso, berenguer, who, was, in, turn, himself, replaced, by, admiral, juan, bautista, aznar, caba, as, both, men, continued, a, policy, of, rule, by, decree, there, was, little, support, for, the, monarchy, in, the, major, cities, consequently, king, alfonso, xiii, of, spain, relented, to, popular, pressure, and, called, municipal, elections, for, 12, april, 1931, left, wing, entities, such, as, the, socialist, and, liberal, republicans, won, almost, all, the, provincial, capitals, and, following, the, resignation, of, aznar, s, government, alfonso, xiii, fled, the, country, at, this, time, the, second, spanish, republic, was, formed, this, republic, remained, in, power, until, the, beginning, of, the, civil, war, five, years, later, the, revolutionary, committee, headed, by, niceto, alcal, zamora, became, the, provisional, government, with, alcal, zamora, himself, as, president, and, head, of, state, the, republic, had, broad, support, from, all, segments, of, society, in, may, 1931, an, incident, in, which, a, taxi, driver, was, attacked, outside, a, monarchist, club, sparked, anti, clerical, violence, throughout, madrid, and, south, west, portion, of, the, country, the, slow, response, on, the, part, of, the, government, disillusioned, the, right, and, reinforced, their, view, that, the, republic, was, determined, to, persecute, the, church, in, june, and, july, the, confederaci, n, nacional, del, trabajo, cnt, called, several, strikes, which, led, to, a, violent, incident, between, cnt, members, and, the, civil, guard, and, a, brutal, crackdown, by, the, civil, guard, and, the, army, against, the, cnt, in, seville, this, led, many, workers, to, believe, the, second, spanish, republic, was, just, as, oppressive, as, the, monarchy, and, the, cnt, announced, its, intention, of, overthrowing, it, via, revolution, elections, in, june, 1931, returned, a, large, majority, of, republicans, and, socialists, with, the, onset, of, the, great, depression, the, government, tried, to, assist, rural, spain, by, instituting, an, eight, hour, day, and, redistributing, land, tenure, to, farm, workers, the, rural, workers, lived, in, some, of, the, worst, poverty, in, europe, at, the, time, and, the, government, tried, to, increase, their, wages, and, improve, working, conditions, this, estranged, small, and, medium, landholders, who, used, hired, labour, the, law, of, municipal, boundaries, forbade, owners, from, hiring, workers, outside, their, locality, when, some, localities, had, labour, shortages, the, law, shut, out, workers, seeking, extra, income, as, pickers, newly, established, labour, arbitration, boards, regulated, salaries, contracts, and, working, hours, but, were, more, favourable, to, workers, than, employers, a, decree, in, july, 1931, increased, overtime, pay, and, several, laws, in, late, 1931, restricted, whom, landowners, could, hire, other, efforts, included, decrees, limiting, the, use, of, machinery, efforts, to, create, a, monopoly, on, hiring, strikes, and, efforts, by, unions, to, limit, women, s, employment, all, done, to, preserve, a, labour, monopoly, for, their, members, class, struggle, intensified, as, landowners, turned, to, counterrevolutionary, organisations, and, local, oligarchs, strikes, workplace, theft, arson, robbery, and, assaults, on, shops, strikebreakers, employers, and, machines, became, increasingly, common, ultimately, the, reforms, of, the, republican, socialist, government, alienated, as, many, people, as, they, pleased, republican, manuel, aza, a, became, prime, minister, of, a, minority, government, in, october, 1931, fascism, remained, a, reactive, threat, and, it, was, facilitated, by, controversial, reforms, to, the, military, in, december, a, new, reformist, liberal, and, democratic, constitution, was, declared, it, included, strong, provisions, enforcing, a, broad, secularisation, of, the, catholic, country, which, included, the, abolition, of, catholic, schools, and, charities, a, move, which, was, met, with, opposition, at, this, point, once, the, constituent, assembly, had, fulfilled, its, mandate, of, approving, a, new, constitution, but, fearing, an, increasing, popular, opposition, the, radical, and, socialist, majority, postponed, the, regular, elections, prolonging, their, time, in, power, for, two, more, years, diaz, s, republican, government, initiated, numerous, reforms, to, in, their, view, modernize, the, country, in, 1932, the, jesuits, were, banned, and, their, property, was, confiscated, the, army, was, reduced, landowners, were, expropriated, home, rule, was, granted, to, catalonia, with, a, local, parliament, and, a, president, of, its, own, in, june, 1933, pope, pius, xi, issued, the, encyclical, dilectissima, nobis, on, oppression, of, the, church, of, spain, raising, his, voice, against, the, persecution, of, the, catholic, church, in, spain, in, november, 1933, the, right, wing, parties, won, the, general, election, the, causal, factors, were, increased, resentment, of, the, incumbent, government, caused, by, a, controversial, decree, implementing, land, reform, by, the, casas, viejas, incident, and, the, formation, of, a, right, wing, alliance, spanish, confederation, of, autonomous, right, wing, groups, ceda, another, factor, was, the, recent, enfranchisement, of, women, most, of, whom, voted, for, centre, right, parties, according, to, stanley, g, payne, and, jes, s, palacios, tapias, left, republicans, attempted, to, have, niceto, alcal, zamora, cancel, the, electoral, results, but, did, not, succeed, despite, ceda, s, electoral, victory, president, alcal, zamora, declined, to, invite, its, leader, gil, robles, to, form, a, government, fearing, ceda, s, monarchist, sympathies, and, proposed, changes, to, the, constitution, instead, he, invited, the, radical, republican, party, s, alejandro, lerroux, to, do, so, despite, receiving, the, most, votes, ceda, was, denied, cabinet, positions, for, nearly, a, year, events, in, the, period, after, november, 1933, called, the, black, biennium, seemed, to, make, a, civil, war, more, likely, alejandro, lerroux, of, the, radical, republican, party, rrp, formed, a, government, reversing, changes, made, by, the, previous, administration, and, granting, amnesty, to, the, collaborators, of, the, unsuccessful, uprising, by, general, jos, sanjurjo, in, august, 1932, some, monarchists, joined, with, the, then, fascist, nationalist, falange, espa, ola, y, de, las, jons, falange, to, help, achieve, their, aims, open, violence, occurred, in, the, streets, of, spanish, cities, and, militancy, continued, to, increase, reflecting, a, movement, towards, radical, upheaval, rather, than, peaceful, democratic, means, as, solutions, a, small, insurrection, by, anarchists, occurred, in, december, 1933, in, response, to, ceda, s, victory, in, which, around, 100, people, died, after, a, year, of, intense, pressure, ceda, the, party, with, the, most, seats, in, parliament, finally, succeeded, in, forcing, the, acceptance, of, three, ministries, the, socialists, psoe, and, communists, reacted, with, an, insurrection, for, which, they, had, been, preparing, for, nine, months, the, rebellion, developed, into, a, bloody, uprising, known, as, the, revolution, of, 1934, fairly, well, armed, revolutionaries, managed, to, take, the, whole, province, of, asturias, murdering, numerous, policemen, clergymen, and, civilians, destroying, religious, buildings, including, churches, convents, and, part, of, the, university, at, oviedo, rebels, in, the, occupied, areas, proclaimed, revolution, for, the, workers, and, abolished, the, existing, currency, the, rebellion, was, crushed, in, two, weeks, by, the, spanish, navy, and, the, spanish, republican, army, the, latter, using, mainly, moorish, colonial, troops, from, spanish, morocco, aza, a, was, in, barcelona, that, day, and, the, lerroux, ceda, government, tried, to, implicate, him, he, was, arrested, and, charged, with, complicity, in, fact, aza, a, had, no, connection, with, the, rebellion, and, was, released, from, prison, in, january, 1935, in, sparking, an, uprising, the, non, anarchist, socialists, like, the, anarchists, manifested, their, conviction, that, the, existing, political, order, was, illegitimate, the, spanish, historian, salvador, de, madariaga, an, aza, a, supporter, and, an, exiled, vocal, opponent, of, francisco, franco, wrote, a, sharp, criticism, of, the, left, s, participation, in, the, revolt, the, uprising, of, 1934, is, unforgivable, the, argument, that, mr, gil, robles, tried, to, destroy, the, constitution, to, establish, fascism, was, at, once, hypocritical, and, false, with, the, rebellion, of, 1934, the, spanish, left, lost, even, the, shadow, of, moral, authority, to, condemn, the, rebellion, of, 1936, reversals, of, land, reform, resulted, in, expulsions, firings, and, arbitrary, changes, to, working, conditions, in, the, central, and, southern, countryside, in, 1935, with, landowners, behaviour, at, times, reaching, genuine, cruelty, which, included, violence, against, farmworkers, and, socialists, causing, several, deaths, one, historian, argued, that, the, behaviour, of, the, right, in, the, southern, countryside, was, one, of, the, main, causes, of, hatred, during, the, civil, war, and, possibly, even, the, civil, war, itself, landowners, taunted, workers, by, saying, that, if, they, went, hungry, they, should, go, eat, the, republic, bosses, fired, leftist, workers, and, imprisoned, trade, union, and, socialist, militants, wages, were, reduced, to, salaries, of, hunger, in, 1935, the, government, led, by, the, radical, republican, party, had, now, endured, a, series, of, crises, after, a, number, of, corruption, scandals, president, niceto, alcal, zamora, who, was, hostile, to, this, government, called, another, election, the, popular, front, narrowly, won, the, 1936, general, election, the, revolutionary, left, wing, masses, took, to, the, streets, and, freed, prisoners, in, the, thirty, six, hours, following, the, election, sixteen, people, were, killed, mostly, by, police, officers, attempting, to, maintain, order, or, to, intervene, in, violent, clashes, and, thirty, nine, were, seriously, injured, also, fifty, churches, and, seventy, conservative, political, centres, were, attacked, or, set, ablaze, manuel, aza, a, was, called, to, form, a, government, before, the, electoral, process, had, ended, he, shortly, replaced, zamora, as, president, taking, advantage, of, a, constitutional, loophole, convinced, that, the, left, was, no, longer, willing, to, follow, the, rule, of, law, and, that, its, vision, of, spain, was, under, threat, the, right, abandoned, the, parliamentary, option, and, began, planning, to, overthrow, the, republic, rather, than, to, control, it, psoe, s, left, wing, socialists, started, to, take, action, julio, lvarez, del, vayo, talked, about, spain, being, converted, into, a, socialist, republic, in, association, with, the, soviet, union, francisco, largo, caballero, declared, that, the, organized, proletariat, will, carry, everything, before, it, and, destroy, everything, until, we, reach, our, goal, the, country, had, rapidly, become, anarchic, even, the, staunch, socialist, indalecio, prieto, at, a, party, rally, in, cuenca, in, may, 1936, complained, we, have, never, seen, so, tragic, a, panorama, or, so, great, a, collapse, as, in, spain, at, this, moment, abroad, spain, is, classified, as, insolvent, this, is, not, the, road, to, socialism, or, communism, but, to, desperate, anarchism, without, even, the, advantage, of, liberty, the, disenchantment, with, aza, a, s, ruling, was, also, voiced, by, miguel, de, unamuno, a, republican, and, one, of, spain, s, most, respected, intellectuals, who, in, june, 1936, told, a, reporter, who, published, his, statement, in, el, adelanto, that, president, manuel, aza, a, should, commit, suicide, as, a, patriotic, act, laia, balcells, observes, that, polarisation, in, spain, just, before, the, coup, was, so, intense, that, physical, confrontations, between, leftists, and, rightists, were, a, routine, occurrence, in, most, localities, six, days, before, the, coup, occurred, there, was, a, riot, between, the, two, in, the, province, of, teruel, balcells, notes, that, spanish, society, was, so, divided, along, left, right, lines, that, the, monk, hilari, raguer, stated, that, in, his, parish, instead, of, playing, cops, and, robbers, children, would, sometimes, play, leftists, and, rightists, within, the, first, month, of, the, popular, front, s, government, nearly, a, quarter, of, the, provincial, governors, had, been, removed, due, to, their, failure, to, prevent, or, control, strikes, illegal, land, occupation, political, violence, and, arson, the, popular, front, government, was, more, likely, to, prosecute, rightists, for, violence, than, leftists, who, committed, similar, acts, aza, a, was, hesitant, to, use, the, army, to, shoot, or, stop, rioters, or, protestors, as, many, of, them, supported, his, coalition, on, the, other, hand, he, was, reluctant, to, disarm, the, military, as, he, believed, he, needed, them, to, stop, insurrections, from, the, extreme, left, illegal, land, occupation, became, widespread, poor, tenant, farmers, knew, the, government, was, disinclined, to, stop, them, by, april, 1936, nearly, 100, 000, peasants, had, appropriated, 400, 000, hectares, of, land, and, perhaps, as, many, as, 1, million, hectares, by, the, start, of, the, civil, war, for, comparison, the, 1931, 33, land, reform, had, granted, only, 6, 000, peasants, 45, 000, hectares, as, many, strikes, occurred, between, april, and, july, as, had, occurred, in, the, entirety, of, 1931, workers, increasingly, demanded, less, work, and, more, pay, social, crimes, refusing, to, pay, for, goods, and, rent, became, increasingly, common, by, workers, particularly, in, madrid, in, some, cases, this, was, done, in, the, company, of, armed, militants, conservatives, the, middle, classes, businessmen, and, landowners, became, convinced, that, revolution, had, already, begun, prime, minister, santiago, casares, quiroga, ignored, warnings, of, a, military, conspiracy, involving, several, generals, who, decided, that, the, government, had, to, be, replaced, to, prevent, the, dissolution, of, spain, both, sides, had, become, convinced, that, if, the, other, side, gained, power, it, would, discriminate, against, their, members, and, attempt, to, suppress, their, political, organisations, shortly, after, the, popular, front, s, victory, in, the, 1936, election, groups, of, officers, both, active, and, retired, got, together, to, discuss, a, coup, by, the, end, of, april, general, emilio, mola, emerged, as, the, leader, of, a, national, conspiracy, network, the, republican, government, reacted, by, reshuffling, suspect, generals, from, influential, posts, azana, however, acutely, aware, that, as, he, did, so, the, army, still, served, as, a, possible, buffer, to, leftist, power, brokers, threatening, his, government, franco, was, sacked, as, chief, of, staff, and, transferred, to, command, of, the, canary, islands, manuel, goded, llopis, was, removed, as, inspector, general, and, made, general, of, the, balearic, islands, mola, was, moved, from, head, of, the, army, of, africa, to, commander, of, pamplona, this, latter, reassignment, however, allowed, mola, to, direct, the, mainland, uprising, general, jos, sanjurjo, became, the, figurehead, of, the, operation, and, helped, reach, an, agreement, with, the, carlists, mola, was, chief, planner, and, second, in, command, jos, antonio, primo, de, rivera, was, put, in, prison, in, mid, march, to, restrict, the, falange, however, government, actions, were, not, as, thorough, as, they, might, have, been, and, warnings, by, the, director, of, security, and, other, figures, were, not, acted, upon, the, revolt, was, devoid, of, ideology, the, goal, was, to, put, an, end, to, anarchical, disorder, mola, s, plan, for, the, new, regime, was, a, republican, dictatorship, modelled, after, salazar, s, portugal, and, along, the, lines, of, being, semi, pluralist, authoritarian, rather, than, fascist, totalitarian, the, initial, government, would, be, an, all, military, directory, which, would, create, a, strong, and, disciplined, state, sanjurjo, would, be, the, head, of, this, new, regime, due, to, being, liked, and, respected, within, the, military, though, his, position, would, be, symbolic, due, to, his, lack, of, political, talent, the, 1931, constitution, would, be, suspended, replaced, by, a, new, constituent, parliament, which, would, be, chosen, by, a, new, politically, purged, electorate, who, would, vote, on, the, issue, of, republic, versus, monarchy, liberal, elements, would, remain, such, as, separation, of, church, and, state, as, well, as, freedom, of, religion, agrarian, issues, would, be, solved, by, regional, commissioners, on, the, basis, of, smallholdings, but, collective, cultivation, would, be, permitted, in, some, circumstances, legislation, prior, to, february, 1936, would, be, respected, violence, would, be, required, to, destroy, opposition, to, the, coup, though, it, seems, mola, did, not, envision, the, mass, atrocities, and, repression, that, would, manifest, during, the, civil, war, of, particular, importance, to, mola, was, ensuring, the, revolt, was, an, army, affair, not, subject, to, special, interests, ensuring, the, position, of, the, armed, forces, as, the, basis, for, the, new, state, however, the, separation, of, church, and, state, was, forgotten, once, the, conflict, assumed, the, dimension, of, a, war, of, religion, and, military, authorities, increasingly, deferred, to, the, church, and, to, the, expression, of, catholic, sentiment, mola, s, program, was, vague, and, only, a, rough, sketch, and, there, were, disagreements, among, coupists, about, their, vision, on, 12, june, prime, minister, casares, quiroga, met, general, juan, yag, e, who, falsely, convinced, casares, of, his, loyalty, to, the, republic, mola, began, planning, in, the, spring, franco, was, a, key, player, because, of, his, prestige, as, a, former, director, of, the, military, academy, and, as, the, man, who, suppressed, the, asturian, miners, strike, of, 1934, he, was, respected, in, the, army, of, africa, the, army, s, toughest, troops, he, wrote, a, cryptic, letter, to, casares, on, 23, june, suggesting, the, military, was, disloyal, but, could, be, restrained, if, he, were, put, in, charge, casares, did, nothing, failing, to, arrest, or, buy, off, franco, with, the, help, of, the, british, intelligence, agents, the, rebels, chartered, a, dragon, rapide, aircraft, to, transport, franco, from, the, canary, islands, to, spanish, morocco, franco, arrived, in, morocco, on, 19, july, franco, was, offered, this, position, as, mola, s, planning, for, the, coup, had, become, increasingly, complex, and, it, did, not, look, like, it, would, be, as, swift, as, he, hoped, instead, likely, turning, into, a, miniature, civil, war, that, would, last, weeks, mola, had, concluded, troops, in, spain, were, insufficient, and, it, would, be, necessary, to, use, elite, units, from, north, africa, something, franco, had, always, believed, would, be, necessary, on, 12, july, 1936, falangists, in, madrid, killed, police, officer, lieutenant, jos,

sotelo, reprisals, followed, the, killing, of, calvo, sotelo, with, police, involvement, aroused, suspicions, and, reactions, among, the, government, s, opponents, on, the, right, although, the, nationalist, generals, were, planning, an, uprising, the, event, was, a, catalyst, and, a, public, justification, for, a, coup, stanley, payne, claims, that, before, these, events, the, idea, of, rebellion, by, army, officers, against, the, government, had, weakened, mola, had, estimated, only, 12, of, officers, reliably, supported, the, coup, and, mola, considered, fleeing, for, fear, he, was, compromised, he, had, to, be, convinced, to, remain, by, his, co, conspirators, however, the, kidnapping, and, murder, of, sotelo, transformed, the, limping, conspiracy, into, a, revolt, that, could, trigger, a, civil, war, the, arbitrary, use, of, lethal, force, by, the, state, and, lack, of, action, against, the, attackers, led, to, public, disapproval, of, the, government, no, effective, punitive, judicial, or, even, investigative, action, was, taken, payne, points, to, a, possible, veto, by, socialists, within, the, government, who, shielded, the, killers, drawn, from, their, ranks, the, murder, of, a, parliamentary, leader, by, state, police, was, unprecedented, and, the, belief, the, state, had, ceased, to, be, neutral, and, effective, encouraged, important, sectors, of, the, right, to, join, the, rebellion, franco, changed, his, mind, on, rebellion, and, dispatched, a, message, to, mola, to, display, his, firm, commitment, the, socialists, and, communists, led, by, indalecio, prieto, demanded, that, arms, be, distributed, to, the, people, before, the, military, took, over, the, prime, minister, was, hesitant, the, uprising, s, timing, was, fixed, at, 17, july, at, 17, 01, agreed, to, by, the, leader, of, the, carlists, manuel, fal, conde, however, the, timing, was, changed, the, men, in, the, morocco, protectorate, were, to, rise, up, at, 05, 00, on, 18, july, and, those, in, spain, proper, a, day, later, so, that, control, of, spanish, morocco, could, be, achieved, and, forces, sent, back, to, the, iberian, peninsula, to, coincide, with, the, risings, there, the, rising, was, intended, to, be, a, swift, coup, d, tat, but, the, government, retained, control, of, most, of, the, country, control, over, spanish, morocco, was, all, but, certain, the, plan, was, discovered, in, morocco, on, 17, july, which, prompted, the, conspirators, to, enact, it, immediately, little, resistance, was, encountered, the, rebels, shot, 189, people, goded, and, franco, immediately, took, control, of, the, islands, to, which, they, were, assigned, on, 18, july, casares, quiroga, refused, an, offer, of, help, from, the, cnt, and, uni, n, general, de, trabajadores, ugt, leading, the, groups, to, proclaim, a, general, strike, in, effect, mobilising, they, opened, weapons, caches, some, buried, since, the, 1934, risings, and, formed, militias, the, paramilitary, security, forces, often, waited, for, the, outcome, of, militia, action, before, either, joining, or, suppressing, the, rebellion, quick, action, by, either, the, rebels, or, anarchist, militias, was, often, enough, to, decide, the, fate, of, a, town, general, gonzalo, queipo, de, llano, secured, seville, for, the, rebels, arresting, a, number, of, other, officers, the, rebels, failed, to, take, any, major, cities, with, the, critical, exception, of, the, july, 1936, military, uprising, in, seville, which, provided, a, landing, point, for, franco, s, african, troops, and, the, primarily, conservative, and, catholic, areas, of, old, castile, and, le, n, which, fell, quickly, they, took, c, diz, with, help, from, the, first, troops, from, africa, the, government, retained, control, of, m, laga, ja, n, and, almer, a, in, madrid, the, rebels, were, hemmed, into, the, cuartel, de, la, monta, a, siege, which, fell, with, considerable, bloodshed, republican, leader, casares, quiroga, was, replaced, by, jos, giral, who, ordered, the, distribution, of, weapons, among, the, civilian, population, this, facilitated, the, defeat, of, the, army, insurrection, in, the, main, industrial, centres, including, madrid, barcelona, and, valencia, but, it, allowed, anarchists, to, take, control, of, barcelona, along, with, large, swathes, of, arag, n, and, catalonia, general, goded, surrendered, in, barcelona, and, was, later, condemned, to, death, the, republican, government, ended, up, controlling, almost, all, the, east, coast, and, central, area, around, madrid, as, well, as, most, of, asturias, cantabria, and, part, of, the, basque, country, in, the, north, hugh, thomas, suggested, that, the, civil, war, could, have, ended, in, the, favour, of, either, side, almost, immediately, if, certain, decisions, had, been, taken, during, the, initial, coup, thomas, argues, that, if, the, government, had, taken, steps, to, arm, the, workers, they, could, probably, have, crushed, the, coup, very, quickly, conversely, if, the, coup, had, risen, everywhere, in, spain, on, the, 18th, rather, than, be, delayed, it, could, have, triumphed, by, the, 22nd, while, the, militias, that, rose, to, meet, the, rebels, were, often, untrained, and, poorly, armed, possessing, only, a, small, number, of, pistols, shotguns, and, dynamite, this, was, offset, by, the, fact, that, the, rebellion, was, not, universal, in, addition, the, falangists, and, carlists, were, themselves, often, not, particularly, powerful, fighters, either, however, enough, officers, and, soldiers, had, joined, the, coup, to, prevent, it, from, being, crushed, swiftly, the, rebels, termed, themselves, nacionales, normally, translated, nationalists, although, the, former, implies, true, spaniards, rather, than, a, nationalistic, cause, the, result, of, the, coup, was, a, nationalist, area, of, control, containing, 11, million, of, spain, s, population, of, 25, million, the, nationalists, had, secured, the, support, of, around, half, of, spain, s, territorial, army, some, 60, 000, men, joined, by, the, army, of, africa, made, up, of, 35, 000, men, and, just, under, half, of, spain, s, militaristic, police, forces, the, assault, guards, the, civil, guards, and, the, carabineers, republicans, controlled, under, half, of, the, rifles, and, about, a, third, of, both, machine, guns, and, artillery, pieces, the, spanish, republican, army, had, just, 18, tanks, of, a, sufficiently, modern, design, and, the, nationalists, took, control, of, 10, naval, capacity, was, uneven, with, the, republicans, retaining, a, numerical, advantage, but, with, the, navy, s, top, commanders, and, two, of, the, most, modern, ships, heavy, cruisers, canarias, captured, at, the, ferrol, shipyard, and, baleares, in, nationalist, control, the, spanish, republican, navy, suffered, from, the, same, problems, as, the, army, many, officers, had, defected, or, been, killed, after, trying, to, do, so, two, thirds, of, air, capability, was, retained, by, the, government, however, the, whole, of, the, republican, air, force, was, very, outdated, the, war, was, cast, by, republican, sympathisers, as, a, struggle, between, tyranny, and, freedom, and, by, nationalist, supporters, as, communist, and, anarchist, red, hordes, versus, christian, civilisation, nationalists, also, claimed, they, were, bringing, security, and, direction, to, an, ungoverned, and, lawless, country, spanish, politics, especially, on, the, left, was, quite, fragmented, on, the, one, hand, socialists, and, communists, supported, the, republic, but, on, the, other, during, the, republic, anarchists, had, mixed, opinions, though, both, major, groups, opposed, the, nationalists, during, the, civil, war, the, latter, in, contrast, were, united, by, their, fervent, opposition, to, the, republican, government, and, presented, a, more, unified, front, the, coup, divided, regular, forces, fairly, evenly, out, of, some, 66, 000, military, actually, under, arms, in, july, 1936, including, the, army, of, africa, and, the, navy, excluding, soldiers, in, service, but, on, leave, during, the, coup, some, 52, 34, 000, were, in, the, republican, zone, and, 48, 32, 000, in, the, nationalist, one, out, of, some, 66, 000, men, in, other, armed, services, guardia, civil, guardia, de, asalto, carabineros, some, 59, 39, 000, joined, the, loyalists, and, some, 41, 27, 000, joined, the, rebels, in, total, out, of, some, 132, 000, armed, and, uniformed, men, actually, in, service, some, 55, 73, 000, seemed, available, to, the, loyalists, and, some, 45, 59, 000, to, the, rebels, however, one, popular, work, claims, that, the, loyalists, controlled, 90, 000, men, and, the, rebels, controlled, some, 130, 000, during, the, first, few, months, both, armies, were, joined, in, high, numbers, by, volunteers, nationalists, by, some, 100, 000, men, and, republicans, by, some, 120, 000, from, august, both, sides, launched, their, own, similarly, scaled, conscription, schemes, resulting, in, further, massive, growth, of, their, armies, finally, the, final, months, of, 1936, saw, the, arrival, of, foreign, troops, international, brigades, joining, the, republicans, and, italian, corpo, truppe, volontarie, ctv, german, legion, condor, and, portuguese, viriatos, joining, the, nationalists, the, result, was, that, in, april, 1937, there, were, some, 360, 000, soldiers, in, the, republican, ranks, and, some, 290, 000, in, the, nationalist, ones, the, armies, kept, growing, the, principal, source, of, manpower, was, conscription, both, sides, continued, and, expanded, their, schemes, the, nationalists, drafting, more, aggressively, and, there, was, little, room, left, for, volunteering, foreigners, contributed, little, to, further, growth, on, the, nationalist, side, the, italians, scaled, down, their, engagement, while, on, the, republican, side, the, influx, of, new, interbrigadistas, did, not, cover, losses, on, the, front, at, the, turn, of, 1937, 1938, each, army, numbered, about, 700, 000, throughout, 1938, the, principal, if, not, exclusive, source, of, new, men, was, a, draft, at, this, stage, it, was, the, republicans, who, conscripted, more, aggressively, and, only, 47, of, their, combatants, were, in, age, corresponding, to, the, nationalist, conscription, age, limits, just, prior, to, the, battle, of, ebro, republicans, achieved, their, all, time, high, slightly, above, 800, 000, yet, nationalists, numbered, 880, 000, the, battle, of, ebro, fall, of, catalonia, and, collapsing, discipline, caused, a, great, shrinking, of, republican, troops, in, late, february, 1939, their, army, was, 400, 000, compared, to, more, than, double, that, number, of, nationalists, in, the, moment, of, their, final, victory, nationalists, commanded, over, 900, 000, troops, the, total, number, of, spaniards, serving, in, the, republican, forces, was, officially, stated, as, 917, 000, later, scholarly, work, estimated, the, number, as, well, over, 1, million, men, though, other, studies, claim, the, republican, total, of, 1, 75, million, including, non, spaniards, and, 27, age, groups, ranging, from, 18, to, 44, years, old, the, total, number, of, spaniards, serving, in, the, nationalist, units, is, estimated, between, nearly, 1, million, men, and, 1, 26, million, including, non, spaniards, which, comprised, 15, age, groups, ranging, from, 18, to, 32, years, old, only, two, countries, openly, and, fully, supported, the, republic, the, mexican, government, and, the, ussr, from, them, especially, the, ussr, the, republic, received, diplomatic, support, volunteers, weapons, and, vehicles, other, countries, remained, neutral, this, neutrality, faced, serious, opposition, from, sympathizers, in, the, united, states, and, united, kingdom, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, other, european, countries, and, from, marxists, worldwide, this, led, to, formation, of, the, international, brigades, thousands, of, foreigners, of, all, nationalities, who, voluntarily, went, to, spain, to, aid, the, republic, in, the, fight, they, meant, a, great, deal, to, morale, but, militarily, were, not, very, significant, the, republic, s, supporters, within, spain, ranged, from, centrists, who, supported, a, moderately, capitalist, liberal, democracy, to, revolutionary, anarchists, who, opposed, the, republic, but, sided, with, it, against, the, coup, forces, their, base, was, primarily, secular, and, urban, but, also, included, landless, peasants, and, was, particularly, strong, in, industrial, regions, like, asturias, the, basque, country, and, catalonia, this, faction, was, called, variously, leales, loyalists, by, supporters, republicans, the, popular, front, or, the, government, by, all, parties, and, or, los, rojos, the, reds, by, their, opponents, republicans, were, supported, by, urban, workers, agricultural, labourers, and, parts, of, the, middle, class, the, conservative, strongly, catholic, basque, country, along, with, catholic, galicia, and, the, more, left, leaning, catalonia, sought, autonomy, or, independence, from, the, central, government, of, madrid, the, republican, government, allowed, for, the, possibility, of, self, government, for, the, two, regions, whose, forces, were, gathered, under, the, people, s, republican, army, ej, rcito, popular, republicano, or, epr, which, was, reorganised, into, mixed, brigades, after, october, 1936, a, few, well, known, people, fought, on, the, republican, side, such, as, english, writer, george, orwell, who, wrote, homage, to, catalonia, 1938, an, account, of, his, experiences, in, the, war, and, canadian, thoracic, surgeon, norman, bethune, who, developed, a, mobile, blood, transfusion, service, for, front, line, operations, simone, weil, briefly, fought, with, the, anarchist, columns, of, buenaventura, durruti, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, the, republicans, outnumbered, the, nationalists, ten, to, one, on, the, front, in, aragon, but, by, january, 1937, that, advantage, had, dropped, to, four, to, one, the, nacionales, or, nationalists, also, called, insurgents, rebels, or, by, opponents, franquistas, or, fascists, feared, national, fragmentation, and, opposed, the, separatist, movements, they, were, chiefly, defined, by, their, anti, communism, which, galvanised, diverse, or, opposed, movements, like, falangists, and, monarchists, their, leaders, had, a, generally, wealthier, more, conservative, monarchist, landowning, background, the, nationalist, side, included, the, carlists, and, alfonsists, spanish, nationalists, the, fascist, falange, and, most, conservatives, and, monarchist, liberals, virtually, all, nationalist, groups, had, strong, catholic, convictions, and, supported, the, native, spanish, clergy, the, nationals, included, the, majority, of, the, catholic, clergy, and, practitioners, outside, of, the, basque, region, important, elements, of, the, army, most, large, landowners, and, many, businessmen, the, nationalist, base, largely, consisted, of, the, middle, classes, conservative, peasant, smallholders, in, the, north, and, catholics, in, general, catholic, support, became, particularly, pronounced, as, a, consequence, of, the, burning, of, churches, and, killing, of, priests, in, most, leftists, zones, during, the, first, six, months, of, the, war, by, mid, 1937, the, catholic, church, gave, its, official, blessing, to, the, franco, regime, religious, fervor, was, a, major, source, of, emotional, support, for, the, nationalists, during, the, civil, war, michael, seidmann, reports, that, devout, catholics, such, as, seminary, students, often, volunteered, to, fight, and, would, die, in, disproportionate, numbers, in, the, war, catholic, confession, cleared, the, soldiers, of, moral, doubt, and, increased, fighting, ability, republican, newspapers, described, nationalist, priests, as, ferocious, in, battle, and, indalecio, prieto, remarked, that, the, enemy, he, feared, most, was, the, requet, who, has, just, received, communion, one, of, the, rightists, principal, motives, was, to, confront, the, anti, clericalism, of, the, republican, regime, and, to, defend, the, catholic, church, which, had, been, targeted, by, opponents, including, republicans, who, blamed, the, institution, for, the, country, s, ills, the, church, opposed, many, of, the, republicans, reforms, which, were, fortified, by, the, spanish, constitution, of, 1931, articles, 24, and, 26, of, the, 1931, constitution, had, banned, the, society, of, jesus, this, proscription, deeply, offended, many, within, the, conservative, fold, the, revolution, in, the, republican, zone, at, the, outset, of, the, war, in, which, 7, 000, clergy, and, thousands, of, lay, people, were, killed, deepened, catholic, support, for, the, nationalists, prior, to, the, war, during, the, asturian, miners, strike, of, 1934, religious, buildings, were, burnt, and, at, least, 100, clergy, religious, civilians, and, pro, catholic, police, were, killed, by, revolutionaries, franco, had, brought, in, spain, s, colonial, army, of, africa, spanish, ej, rcito, de, frica, or, cuerpo, de, ej, rcito, marroqu, and, reduced, the, miners, to, submission, by, heavy, artillery, attacks, and, bombing, raids, the, spanish, legion, committed, atrocities, and, the, army, carried, out, summary, executions, of, leftists, the, repression, in, the, aftermath, was, brutal, and, prisoners, were, tortured, the, moroccan, fuerzas, regulares, ind, genas, joined, the, rebellion, and, played, a, significant, role, in, the, civil, war, while, the, nationalists, are, often, assumed, to, have, drawn, in, the, majority, of, military, officers, this, is, a, somewhat, simplistic, analysis, the, spanish, army, had, its, own, internal, divisions, and, long, standing, rifts, officers, supporting, the, coup, tended, to, be, africanistas, men, who, fought, in, north, africa, between, 1909, and, 1923, while, those, who, stayed, loyal, tended, to, be, peninsulares, men, who, stayed, back, in, spain, during, this, period, this, was, because, during, spain, s, north, african, campaigns, the, traditional, promotion, by, seniority, was, suspended, in, favour, of, promotion, by, merit, through, battlefield, heroism, this, tended, to, benefit, younger, officers, starting, their, careers, as, they, could, while, older, officers, had, familial, commitments, that, made, it, harder, for, them, to, be, deployed, in, north, africa, officers, in, front, line, combat, corps, primarily, infantry, and, cavalry, benefited, over, those, in, technical, corps, those, in, artillery, engineering, etc, because, they, had, more, chances, to, demonstrate, the, requisite, battlefield, heroism, and, had, also, traditionally, enjoyed, promotion, by, seniority, the, peninsulares, resented, seeing, the, africanistas, rapidly, leapfrog, through, the, ranks, while, the, africanistas, themselves, were, seen, as, swaggering, and, arrogant, further, fueling, resentment, thus, when, the, coup, occurred, officers, who, joined, the, rebellion, particularly, from, franco, s, rank, downwards, were, often, africanistas, while, senior, officers, and, those, in, non, front, line, positions, tended, to, oppose, it, though, a, small, number, of, senior, africanistas, opposed, the, coup, as, well, it, has, also, been, argued, that, officers, who, stayed, loyal, to, the, republic, were, more, likely, to, have, been, promoted, and, to, have, been, favoured, by, the, republican, regime, such, as, those, in, the, aviation, and, assault, guard, units, thus, while, often, thought, of, as, a, rebellion, of, the, generals, this, is, not, correct, of, the, eighteen, division, generals, only, four, rebelled, of, the, four, division, generals, without, postings, two, rebelled, and, two, remained, loyal, fourteen, of, the, fifty, six, brigade, generals, rebelled, the, rebels, tended, to, draw, from, less, senior, officers, of, the, approximately, 15, 301, officers, just, over, half, rebelled, catalan, and, basque, nationalists, were, divided, left, wing, catalan, nationalists, sided, with, the, republicans, while, conservative, catalan, nationalists, were, far, less, vocal, in, supporting, the, government, due, to, anti, clericalism, and, confiscations, occurring, in, areas, within, its, control, basque, nationalists, heralded, by, the, conservative, basque, nationalist, party, were, mildly, supportive, of, the, republican, government, although, some, in, navarre, sided, with, the, uprising, for, the, same, reasons, influencing, conservative, catalans, not, withstanding, religious, matters, basque, nationalists, who, were, for, the, most, part, catholic, generally, sided, with, the, republicans, although, the, pnv, basque, nationalist, party, was, reported, passing, the, plans, of, bilbao, defences, to, the, nationalists, in, an, attempt, to, reduce, the, duration, and, casualties, of, siege, the, spanish, civil, war, exposed, political, divisions, across, europe, the, right, and, the, catholics, supported, the, nationalists, to, stop, the, spread, of, bolshevism, on, the, left, including, labour, unions, students, and, intellectuals, the, war, represented, a, necessary, battle, to, stop, the, spread, of, fascism, anti, war, and, pacifist, sentiment, was, strong, in, many, countries, leading, to, warnings, that, the, civil, war, could, escalate, into, a, second, world, war, in, this, respect, the, war, was, an, indicator, of, the, growing, instability, across, europe, the, spanish, civil, war, involved, large, numbers, of, non, spanish, citizens, who, participated, in, combat, and, advisory, positions, britain, and, france, led, a, political, alliance, of, 27, nations, that, pledged, non, intervention, including, an, embargo, on, all, arms, exports, to, spain, the, united, states, unofficially, adopted, a, position, of, non, intervention, as, well, despite,

were, ineffective, as, the, conquest, of, ethiopia, in, the, second, italo, ethiopian, war, made, the, italian, government, confident, in, its, military, power, benito, mussolini, joined, the, war,

substantial, role, in, the, mediterranean, blockade, and, ultimately, italy, supplied, machine, guns, artillery, aircraft, tankettes, the, aviazione, legionaria, and, the, corpo, truppe, volontarie,

broke, out, in, july, 1936, adolf, hitler, quickly, sent, in, powerful, air, units, that, fought, in, combat, on, the, ground, whilst, not, deploying, formed, ground, combat, forces, like, those, of, italy, germany, did, supply, several, hundred, armoured, vehicles, as, well, as, a, number, of, combat, instructors, these, efforts, ensuring, that, the, nationalists, acquired, armoured, capabilities, to, counter, those, of, the, republican, side, the, manner, of, engagement, ensured, that, the, war, provided, combat, experience, with, the, latest, technology, for, the, german, military, however, the, intervention, also, posed, the, risk, of, escalating, into, a, world, war, for, which, hitler, was, not, ready, therefore, he, limited, his, aid, and, instead, encouraged, benito, mussolini, to, send, in, large, italian, ground, units, which, did, engage, in, land, battles, a, crucial, element, of, nazi, germany, s, actions, was, the, formation, of, the, multitasking, condor, legion, a, unit, composed, of, volunteers, from, the, luftwaffe, and, the, german, army, heer, from, july, 1936, to, march, 1939, the, condor, legion, proved, to, be, especially, useful, in, that, first, year, of, conflict, in, operations, that, included, the, 1936, battle, of, the, toledo, movement, of, the, army, of, africa, to, mainland, spain, in, the, war, s, early, stages, and, later, the, detachment, of, the, republican, gnobernito, s, from, support, by, the, central, government, german, operations, slowly, expanded, to, include, strike, targets, most, notably, and, controversially, the, bombing, of, guernica, which, on, 26, april, 1937, killed, 200, to, 300, civilians, germany, also, used, the, war, to, test, new, weapons, such, as, luftwaffe, junkers, ju, 87, stukas, and, junkers, ju, 52, transport, trimotors, the, ju52, s, used, both, as, transport, platforms, and, as, bombers, efforts, that, showed, themselves, to, be, effective, german, involvement, was, further, manifested, through, undertakings, such, as, operation, ursula, a, u, boat, undertaking, and, contributions, from, the, kriegsmarine, the, legion, spearheaded, many, nationalist, victories, particularly, in, aerial, combat, while, spain, further, provided, a, proving, ground, for, german, tank, tactics, the, training, which, german, units, provided, to, the, nationalist, forces, would, prove, valuable, by, the, war, s, end, perhaps, 56, 000, nationalist, soldiers, encompassing, infantry, artillery, aerial, and, naval, forces, had, been, trained, by, german, detachments, hitler, s, policy, for, spain, was, shrewd, and, pragmatic, the, minutes, of, a, conference, at, the, reich, chancellery, in, berlin, on, 10, november, 1937, summarised, his, views, on, foreign, policy, regarding, the, spanish, civil, war, on, the, other, hand, a, one, hundred, percent, victory, for, franco, was, not, desirable, either, from, the, german, point, of, view, rather, were, we, interested, in, a, continuance, of, the, war, and, in, the, keeping, up, of, the, tension, in, the, mediterranean, hitler, wanted, to, help, franco, just, enough, to, gain, his, gratitude, and, to, prevent, the, side, supported, by, the, soviet, union, from, winning, but, not, large, enough, to, give, the, caudillo, a, quick, victory, a, total, of, approximately, 16, 000, german, citizens, fought, in, the, war, with, approximately, 300, killed, though, no, more, than, 10, 000, participated, at, any, one, time, german, aid, to, the, nationalists, amounted, to, approximately, 43, 000, 000, 215, 000, 000, in, 1939, prices, 15, 5, of, which, was, used, for, salaries, and, expenses, and, 21, 9, for, direct, delivery, of, supplies, to, spain, while, 62, 6, was, expended, on, the, condor, legion, in, total, germany, provided, the, nationalists, with, 600, planes, and, 200, tanks, the, estado, novo, regime, of, portuguese, prime, minister, ant, nio, de, oliveira, salazar, played, an, important, role, in, supplying, francisco, franco, s, forces, with, ammunition, and, logistical, help, manuel, aza, a, president, of, the, embattled, spanish, republic, had, financed, and, armed, those, seeking, to, topple, salazar, s, conservative, regime, radicals, in, spain, and, portugal, had, long, advocated, for, peninsular, unity, salazar, was, concerned, that, the, spanish, left, s, internationalist, views, and, support, for, iberian, federalism, posed, a, threat, to, portugal, s, independence, fearing, that, a, leftist, spain, might, seek, to, dominate, portugal, many, middle, class, radicals, in, portugal, supported, this, idea, believing, that, their, country, needed, to, integrate, with, spain, to, achieve, agricultural, modernization, and, industrialization, while, the, nationalists, lacked, access, to, seaports, early, on, they, secured, control, of, the, entire, border, with, portugal, by, the, end, of, august, 1936, thus, giving, salazar, and, his, regime, a, free, hand, to, render, whatever, assistance, to, franco, they, saw, fit, without, fear, of, republican, interference, or, retaliation, salazar, s, portugal, helped, the, nationalist, side, receive, armaments, shipments, from, abroad, including, ordnance, when, certain, nationalist, forces, virtually, ran, out, of, ammunition, consequently, the, nationalists, called, lisbon, the, port, of, castile, however, despite, the, border, being, secured, on, 8, september, 1936, a, naval, revolt, took, place, in, lisbon, the, crews, of, two, naval, portuguese, vessels, the, nrp, afonso, de, albuquerque, and, the, nrp, d, o, mutinied, the, sailors, who, were, affiliated, with, the, portuguese, communist, party, confined, their, officers, and, attempted, to, sail, the, ships, out, of, lisbon, to, join, the, spanish, republican, forces, fighting, in, spain, salazar, ordered, the, ships, to, be, destroyed, by, gunfire, both, afonso, de, albuquerque, and, d, o, received, direct, hits, and, were, grounded, salazar, supported, franco, primarily, to, ensure, the, survival, of, his, own, regime, he, feared, the, republican, side, would, threaten, the, stability, and, independence, of, portugal, salazar, s, strategy, was, the, support, franco, in, its, struggle, against, the, republic, the, preservation, of, the, two, iberian, states, as, independent, but, in, association, with, the, atlanticist, foreign, policy, of, england, and, the, survival, of, the, portuguese, regime, despite, its, discreet, direct, military, involvement, restrained, to, a, somewhat, semi, official, endorsement, by, its, authoritarian, regime, a, viriatos, legion, volunteer, force, was, organised, but, disbanded, due, to, political, unrest, between, 8, 000, and, 12, 000, salazar, s, desire, to, maintain, a, prudent, distance, from, initiatives, that, could, threaten, the, image, of, neutrality, that, the, government, sought, to, maintain, at, all, costs, in, the, eyes, of, the, international, community, meant, that, the, idea, of, an, exclusively, portuguese, volunteer, corps, was, never, put, into, practice, salazar, and, the, military, leadership, did, not, look, favorably, upon, misplaced, adventurism, and, in, general, any, plans, for, direct, intervention, from, which, it, would, be, difficult, if, not, impossible, to, clearly, distance, themselves, in, front, of, the, international, non, intervention, committee, the, viriatos, were, integrated, into, various, units, and, battle, fronts, the, spanish, legion, falange, militias, or, requet, s, rebel, aviation, or, regular, army, brigades, without, forming, any, specific, unit, there, were, also, portuguese, militiamen, fighting, in, the, defense, of, the, spanish, republic, although, their, participation, was, much, smaller, some, were, anti, salazarist, exiles, belonging, to, the, portuguese, popular, front, in, spain, the, iberian, anarchist, federation, or, the, portuguese, communist, party, they, were, workers, intellectuals, and, politicians, allied, against, the, dictatorship, in, portugal, while, fully, supporting, franco, s, side, in, many, ways, the, portuguese, regime, spared, no, efforts, at, dissociating, itself, from, their, own, citizens, enlisted, in, the, spanish, in, order, to, maintain, the, non, intervention, fa, ade, in, february, 1937, under, pressure, from, the, london, committee, the, salazar, government, was, forced, to, publish, a, decree, prohibiting, the, enlistment, of, volunteers, on, either, side, of, the, conflict, in, march, 1937, the, portuguese, military, observation, mission, in, spain, mmpoe, was, created, with, three, essential, objectives, to, gain, knowledge, of, new, weapons, and, military, techniques, to, ensure, a, privileged, position, for, portugal, in, the, new, european, scenario, and, to, assist, portuguese, combatants, in, january, 1938, salazar, appointed, pedro, teot, nio, pereira, as, special, liaison, of, the, portuguese, government, to, franco, s, government, where, he, achieved, great, prestige, and, influence, in, april, 1938, pereira, officially, became, a, full, rank, portuguese, ambassador, to, spain, remaining, in, this, post, throughout, world, war, ii, propaganda, about, the, military, achievements, of, the, viriatos, spread, throughout, the, portuguese, press, after, peace, was, signed, in, april, 1939, but, the, government, did, not, take, responsibility, for, the, fate, of, the, portuguese, soldiers, in, the, spanish, civil, war, because, officially, portugal, did, not, participate, in, the, conflict, although, encouraged, by, the, anti, communist, and, pro, franco, propaganda, of, the, estado, novo, the, portuguese, combatants, went, to, spain, of, their, own, free, will, and, therefore, all, responsibilities, arising, from, their, participation, in, the, battle, were, theirs, alone, according, to, the, regime, s, political, position, the, government, considered, that, ex, combatants, in, spain, should, accept, their, precarious, condition, as, volunteer, soldiers, and, therefore, had, no, right, to, any, official, assistance, upon, returning, to, portugal, the, francoist, authorities, were, ungrateful, for, the, help, provided, by, the, viriatos, many, of, those, who, returned, to, portugal, after, the, war, were, forced, to, deposit, all, their, savings, at, the, spanish, customs, accused, of, currency, evasion, portugal, was, instrumental, in, providing, the, nationalists, with, organizational, skills, and, reassurance, from, the, iberian, neighbour, to, franco, and, his, allies, that, no, interference, would, hinder, the, supply, traffic, directed, to, the, nationalist, cause, just, a, few, days, before, the, end, of, the, spanish, civil, war, on, 17, march, 1939, portugal, and, spain, signed, the, iberian, pact, a, non, aggression, treaty, that, marked, the, beginning, of, a, new, phase, in, iberian, relations, meetings, between, franco, and, salazar, played, a, fundamental, role, in, this, new, political, arrangement, the, pact, proved, to, be, a, decisive, instrument, in, keeping, the, iberian, peninsula, out, of, hitler, s, continental, system, in, may, 1939, in, a, speech, delivered, to, the, national, assembly, salazar, emphasized, that, portugal, had, acted, as, a, factor, of, peace, amidst, the, growing, chaos, in, europe, he, asserted, that, the, country, had, taken, all, necessary, steps, to, prevent, its, neighbor, from, falling, under, communist, enslavement, later, franco, spoke, of, salazar, in, glowing, terms, in, an, interview, in, the, le, figaro, newspaper, the, most, complete, statesman, the, one, most, worthy, of, respect, that, i, have, known, is, salazar, i, regard, him, as, an, extraordinary, personality, for, his, intelligence, his, political, sense, and, his, humility, his, only, defect, is, probably, his, modesty, romanian, volunteers, were, led, by, ion, mo, a, deputy, leader, of, the, iron, guard, legion, of, the, archangel, michael, whose, group, of, seven, legionaries, visited, spain, in, december, 1936, to, ally, their, movement, with, the, nationalists,

had, started, an, international, communist, conference, was, held, at, prague, to, arrange, plans, to, help, the, republican, government, it, decided, to, raise, an, international, brigade, of, 5, 000, men, and, a, fund, of, 1, billion, francs, at, the, same, time, communist, parties, throughout, the, world, quickly, launched, a, full, scale, propaganda, campaign, in, support, of, the, popular,

german, products, were, later, re, exported, to, republican, spain, however, gpcc, was, selling, its, own, arms, as, the, company, operated, a, number, of, factories, and, partially, thanks, to, spanish, sales, it, became, the, largest, company, in, greece, most, of, greek, sales, went, to, the, republic, on, part, of, the, spaniards, the, deals, were, negotiated, by, grigori, rosenberg, son,

the, success, of, nationalist, forces, in, spain, would, result, in, the, creation, of, an, ally, state, of, nazi, germany, and, fascist, italy, an, alliance, that, would, nearly, encircle, france,

republicans, on, 21, august, 1936, france, signed, the, non, intervention, agreement, however, the, blum, government, provided, aircraft, to, the, republicans, covertly, with, potez, 540, bomber, aircraft, nicknamed, the, flying, coffin, by, spanish, republican, pilots, dewoitine, aircraft, and, loire, 46, fighter, aircraft, being, sent, from, 7, august, 1936, to, december, of, that, year, to, republican, forces, france, through, the, favour, of, pro, communist, air, minister, pierre, cot, also, sent, a, group, of, trained, fighter, pilots, and, engineers, to, help, the, republicans, also,

ended, in, december, 1936, the, possibility, of, french, intervention, against, the, nationalists, remained, a, serious, possibility, throughout, the, war, german, intelligence, reported, to, franco, and, the, nationalists, that, the, french, military, was, engaging, in, open, discussions, about, intervention, in, the, war, through, french, military, intervention, in, catalonia, and, the, balearic, islands, in, 1938, franco, feared, an, immediate, french, intervention, against, a, potential, nationalist, victory, in, spain, through, french, occupation, of, catalonia, the, balearic, islands, and, spanish, morocco, a, large, air, and, sealift, of, nationalist, troops, in, spanish, morocco, was, organised, to, the, southwest, of, spain, coup, leader, sanjurjo, was, killed, in, a, plane, crash, on, 20, july, leaving, an, effective, command, split, between, mola, in, the, north, and, franco, in, the, south, this, period, also, saw, the, worst, actions, of, the, so, called, red, and, white, terrors, in, spain, on, 21, july, the, fifth, day, of, the, rebellion, the, nationalists, captured, the, central, spanish, naval, base, located, in, ferrol, galicia, a, rebel, force, under, colonel, alfonso, beorlegui, canet, sent, by, general, mola, and, colonel, esteban, garc, a, undertook, the, campaign, of, gipuzkoa, from, july, to, september, the, capture, of, gipuzkoa, isolated, the, republican, provinces, in, the, north, on, 5, september, the, nationalists, closed, the, french, border, to, the, republicans, in, the, battle, of, ir, n, on, 15, september, san, sebasti, n, home, to, a, divided, republican, force, of, anarchists, and, basque, nationalists, was, taken, by, nationalist, soldiers, the, republic, proved, ineffective, militarily, relying, on, disorganised, revolutionary, militias, the, republican, government, under, giral, resigned, on, 4, september, unable, to, cope, with, the, situation, and, was, replaced, by, a, mostly, socialist, organisation, under, francisco, largo, caballero, the, new, leadership, began, to, unify, central, command, in, the, republican, zone, the, civilian, militias, were, often, simply, just, civilians, armed, with, whatever, was, available, thus, they, fared, poorly, in, combat, particularly, against, the, professional, army, of, africa, armed, with, modern, weapons, ultimately, contributing, to, franco, s, rapid, advance, on, the, nationalist, side, franco, was, chosen, as, chief, military, commander, at, a, meeting, of, ranking, generals, at, salamanca, on, 21, september, now, called, by, the, title, general, simo, franco, won, another, victory, on, 27, september, when, his, troops, relieved, the, siege, of, the, alc, zar, in, toledo, which, had, been, held, by, a, nationalist, garrison, under, colonel, jos, moscard, ituarte, since, the, beginning, of, the, rebellion, resisting, thousands, of, republican, troops, who, completely, surrounded, the, isolated, building, moroccans, and, elements, of, the, spanish, legion, came, to, the, rescue, two, days, after, relieving, the, siege, franco, proclaimed, himself, caudillo, chieftain, the, spanish, equivalent, of, the, italian, duce, and, the, german, f, hrer, meaning, director, while, forcibly, unifying, the, various, and, diverse, falangist, royalist, and, other, elements, within, the, nationalist, cause, the, diversion, to, toledo, gave, madrid, time, to, prepare, a, defense, but, was, hailed, as, a, major, propaganda, victory, and, personal, success, for, franco, on, 1, october, 1936, general, franco, was, confirmed, head, of, state, and, armies, in, burgos, a, similar, dramatic, success, for, the, nationalists, occurred, on, 17, october, when, troops, coming, from, galicia, relieved, the, besieged, town, of, oviedo, in, northern, spain, in, october, the, francoist, troops, launched, a, major, offensive, toward, madrid, reaching, it, in, early, november, and, launching, a, major, assault, on, the, city, on, 8, november, the, republican, government, was, forced, to, shift, from, madrid, to, valencia, outside, the, combat, zone, on, 6, november, however, the, nationalists, attack, on, the, capital, was, repulsed, in, fierce, fighting, between, 8, and, 23, november, a, contributory, factor, in, the, successful, republican, defense, was, the, effectiveness, of, the, fifth, regiment, and, later, the, arrival, of, the, international, brigades, though, only, an, approximate, 3, 000, foreign, volunteers, participated, in, the, battle, having, failed, to, take, the, capital, franco, bombarded, it, from, the, air, and, in, the, following, two, years, mounted, several, offensives, to, try, to, encircle, madrid, beginning, the, three, year, siege, of, madrid, the, second, battle, of, the, corunna, road, a, nationalist, offensive, to, the, northwest, pushed, republican, forces, back, but, failed, to, isolate, madrid, the, battle, lasted, into, january, with, his, ranks, swelled, by, italian, troops, and, spanish, colonial, soldiers, from, morocco, franco, made, another, attempt, to, capture, madrid, in, january, and, february, 1937, but, was, again, unsuccessful, the, battle, of, m, laga, started, in, mid, january, and, this, nationalist, offensive, in, spain, s, southeast, would, turn, into, a, disaster, for, the, republicans, who, were, poorly, organised, and, armed, the, city, was, taken, by, franco, on, 8, february, the, consolidation, of, various, militias, into, the, republican, army, had, started, in, december, 1936, the, main, nationalist, advance, to, cross, the, jarama, and, cut, the, supply, to, madrid, by, the, valencia, road, termed, the, battle, of, jarama, led, to, heavy, casualties, 6, 000, 20, 000, on, both, sides, the, operation, s, main, objective, was, not, met, though, nationalists, gained, a, modest, amount, of, territory, a, similar, nationalist, offensive, the, battle, of, guadalajara, was, a, more, significant, defeat, for, franco, and, his, armies, this, was, the, only, publicised, republican, victory, of, the, war, franco, used, italian, troops, and, blitzkrieg, tactics, while, many, strategists, blamed, franco, for, the, rightists, defeat, the, germans, believed, it, was, the, former, at, fault, for, the, nationalists, 5, 000, casualties, and, loss, of, valuable, equipment, the, german, strategists, successfully, argued, that, the, nationalists, needed, to, concentrate, on, vulnerable, areas, first, the, war, in, the, north, began, in, mid, march, with, the, biscay, campaign, the, basques, suffered, most, from, the, lack, of, a, suitable, air, force, on, 26, april, the, condor, legion, bombed, the, town, of, guernica, killing, 200, 300, and, causing, significant, damage, the, bombing, of, guernica, had, a, significant, effect, on, international, opinion, the, basques, retreated, from, the, area, april, and, may, saw, the, may, days, infighting, among, republican, groups, in, catalonia, the, dispute, was, between, an, ultimately, victorious, government, communist, forces, and, the, anarchist, cnt, the, disturbance, pleased, nationalist, command, but, little, was, done, to, exploit, republican, divisions, after, the, fall, of, guernica, the, republican, government, began, to, fight, back, with, increasing, effectiveness, in, july, it, made, a, move, to, recapture, segovia, forcing, franco, to, delay, his, advance, on, the, bilbao, front, but, for, only, two, weeks, the, huesca, offensive, failed, similarly, mola, franco, s, second, in, command, was, killed, on, 3, june, in, an, airplane, accident, in, early, july, despite, the, earlier, loss, at, the, battle, of, bilbao, the, government, launched, a, strong, counter, offensive, to, the, west, of, madrid, focusing, on, brunete, the, battle, of, brunete, however, was, a, significant, defeat, for, the, republic, which, lost, many, of, its, most, accomplished, troops, the, offensive, led, to, an, advance, of, 50, square, kilometres, 19, sq, mi, and, left, 25, 000, republican, casualties, a, republican, offensive, against, zaragoza, was, also, a, failure, despite, having, land, and, aerial, advantages, the, battle, of, belchite, a, place, lacking, any, military, interest, resulted, in, an, advance, of, only, 10, kilometres, 6, 2, mi, and, the, loss, of, much, equipment, franco, invaded, arag, n, and, took, the, city, of, santander, in, cantabria, in, august, with, the, surrender, of, the, republican, army, in, the, basque, territory, came, the, santo, a, agreement, gij, n, finally, fell, in, late, october, in, the, asturias, offensive, franco, had, effectively, won, in, the, north, at, november, s, end, with, franco, s, troops, closing, in, on, valencia, the, government, had, to, move, again, this, time, to, barcelona, the, battle, of, teruel, was, an, important, confrontation, in, 1938, its, outcome, heralding, future, progress, of, the, war, the, city, which, had, formerly, belonged, to, the, nationalists, was, conquered, by, republicans, in, january, francoist, troops, launched, a, counter, offensive, and, recovered, the, city, by, 22, february, the, nationalists, relying, heavily, on, german, and, italian, air, support, teruel, secured, on, 7, march, the, nationalists, launched, the, aragon, offensive, by, 14, april, they, had, pushed, east, through, to, the, mediterranean, cutting, the, republican, held, portion, of, spain, in, two, the, republican, government, attempted, to, sue, for, peace, in, may, but, franco, demanded, unconditional, surrender, and, the, war, raged, on, in, july, the, nationalist, army, pressed, southward, from, teruel, pushing, south, along, the, coast, toward, the, capital, of, the, republic, at, valencia, but, was, halted, in, heavy, fighting, along, the, xyz, line, a, system, of, fortifications, defending, valencia, the, republican, government, then, launched, an, all, out, campaign, to, reconnect, their, territory, in, the, battle, of, the, ebro, from, 24, july, until, 26, november, the, scale, of, the, republican, offensive, forced, franco, to, personally, take, command, the, republican, ebro, campaign, was, unsuccessful, undermined, by, the, agreement, signed, in, munich, germany, between, hitler, and, chamberlain, the, munich, agreement, effectively, caused, a, collapse, in, republican, morale, by, ending, hope, of, an, anti, fascist, alliance, with, western, powers, the, subsequent, republican, retreat, from, the, ebro, all, but, determined, the, outcome, of, the, war, eight, days, before, the, new, year, franco, threw, massive, forces, into, an, invasion, of, catalonia, franco, s, troops, conquered, catalonia, in, a, whirlwind, campaign, during, the, first, two, months, of, 1939, tarragona, fell, on, 15, january, followed, by, barcelona, on, 26, january, and, girona, on, 2, february, on, 27, february, the, united, kingdom, and, france, recognized, the, franco, regime, only, madrid, and, a, few, other, strongholds, remained, for, the, republican, forces, on, 5, march, 1939, the, republican, army, led, by, the, colonel, segismundo, casado, and, the, politician, juli, n, besteiro, rose, against, the, prime, minister, juan, negr, n, and, formed, the, national, defence, council, consejo, nacional, de, defensa, or, cnd, to, negotiate, a, peace, deal, negr, n, fled, to, france, on, 6, march, but, the, communist, troops, around, madrid, rose, against, the, junta, starting, a, brief, civil, war, within, the, civil, war, casado, defeated, them, and, began, peace, negotiations, with, the, nationalists, but, franco, refused, to, accept, anything, less, than, unconditional, surrender, on, 26, march, the, nationalists, started, a, general, offensive, on, 28, march, the, nationalists, occupied, madrid, and, by, 31, march, they, controlled, all, spanish, territory, franco, proclaimed, victory, in, a, radio, speech, aired, on, 1, april, when, the, last, of, the, republican, forces, surrendered, after, the, end, of, the, war, there, were, harsh, reprisals, against, franco, s, former, enemies, thousands, of, republicans, were, imprisoned, and, at, least, 30, 000, executed, other, estimates, of, these, deaths, range, from, 50, 000, to, 200, 000, depending, on, which, deaths, are, included, many, others, were, put, to, forced, labour, building, railways, draining, swamps, and, digging, canals, at, the, end, of, the, war, in, what, was, called, la, retirada, withdrawal, hundreds, of, thousands, of, republicans, fled, abroad, with, some, 500, 000, fleeing, to, france, refugees, were, confined, in, internment, camps, of, the, french, third, republic, such, as, camp, gurs, or, camp, vernet, where, 12, 000, republicans, were, housed, in, squalid, conditions, in, his, capacity, as, consul, in, paris, chilean, poet, and, politician, pablo, neruda, organised, the, immigration, to, chile, of, 2, 200, republican, exiles, in, france, using, the, ship, ss, winnipeg, of, the, 17, 000, refugees, housed, in, gurs, farmers, and, others, who, could, not, find, relations, in, france, were, encouraged, by, the, third, republic, in, agreement, with, the, francoist, government, to, return, to, spain, the, great, majority, did, so, and, were, turned, over, to, the, francoist, authorities, in, ir, n, from, there, they, were, transferred, to, the, miranda, de, ebro, camp, for, purification, according, to, the, law, of, political, responsibilities, after, the, proclamation, by, marshal, philippe, p, tain, of, the, vichy, regime, the, refugees, became, political, prisoners, and, the, french, police, attempted, to, round, up, those, who, had, been, liberated, from, the, camp, along, with, other, undesirable, people, the, spaniards, were, sent, to, the, drancy, internment, camp, before, being, deported, to, nazi, germany, about, 5, 000, spaniards, died, in, the, mauthausen, concentration, camp, after, the, official, end, of, the, war, guerrilla, warfare, was, waged, on, an, irregular, basis, by, the, spanish, maquis, well, into, the, 1950s, gradually, reduced, by, military, defeats, and, scant, support, from, the, exhausted, population, in, 1944, a, group, of, republican, veterans, who, also, fought, in, the, french, resistance, against, the, nazis, invaded, the, val, d, aran, in, northwest, catalonia, but, were, defeated, after, 10, days, according, to, some, scholars, the, spanish, civil, war, lasted, until, 1952, until, 1939, it, was, conventional, civil, war, but, afterwards, it, turned, into, an, irregular, civil, war, the, republicans, oversaw, the, evacuation, of, 30, 000, 35, 000, children, from, their, zone, starting, with, basque, areas, from, which, 20, 000, were, evacuated, their, destinations, included, the, united, kingdom, and, the, ussr, and, many, other, countries, in, europe, along, with, mexico, the, policy, of, evacuating, children, to, foreign, countries, was, initially, opposed, to, by, elements, in, the, government, as, well, as, private, charities, who, saw, the, policy, as, unnecessary, and, harmful, to, the, well, being, of, the, evacuated, children, on, 21, may, 1937, around, 4, 000, basque, children, were, evacuated, to, the, uk, on, the, aging, steamship, ss, habana, from, the, spanish, port, of, santurtzi, upon, their, arrival, two, days, later, in, southampton, the, children, were, sent, to, families, all, over, england, with, over, 200, children, accommodated, in, wales, the, upper, age, limit, was, initially, set, at, 12, but, raised, to, 15, by, mid, september, all, of, los, ni, os, vascos, as, they, became, known, had, found, homes, with, families, most, were, repatriated, to, spain, after, the, war, but, some, 250, were, still, in, britain, by, the, end, of, the, second, world, war, in, 1945, and, some, chose, to, settle, there, during, the, civil, war, the, nationalist, and, republican, military, expenditures, combined, totalled, some, 3, 89bn, on, average, 1, 44bn, annually, the, overall, nationalist, expenditures, are, calculated, at, 2, 04bn, while, the, republican, ones, reached, ca, 1, 85bn, in, comparison, in, 1936, 1938, the, french, military, expenditure, totalled, 0, 87bn, the, italian, ones, reached, 2, 64bn, and, the, british, ones, stood, at, 4, 13bn, as, in, the, mid, 1930s, the, spanish, gdp, was, much, smaller, than, the, italian, french, or, british, ones, and, as, in, the, second, republic, the, annual, defence, and, security, budget, was, usually, around, 0, 13bn, total, annual, governmental, spendings, were, close, to, 0, 65bn, wartime, military, expenditures, put, huge, strain, on, the, spanish, economy, financing, the, war, posed, enormous, challenge, for, both, the, nationalists, and, the, republicans, the, two, combatant, parties, followed, similar, financial, strategies, in, both, cases, money, creation, rather, than, new, taxes, or, issue, of, debt, was, key, to, financing, the, war, both, sides, relied, mostly, on, domestic, resources, in, the, case, of, the, nationalists, they, amounted, to, 63, of, the, overall, spendings, 1, 28bn, and, in, the, case, of, the, republicans, they, stood, at, 59, 1, 09bn, in, the, nationalist, zone, money, creation, was, responsible, for, some, 69, of, domestic, resources, while, in, the, republican, one, the, corresponding, figure, stood, at, 60, it, was, accomplished, mostly, by, means, of, advances, credits, loans, and, debit, balances, from, respective, central, banks, however, while, in, the, nationalist, zone, the, rising, stock, of, money, was, only, marginally, above, the, production, growth, rate, in, the, republican, zone, it, by, far, exceeded, dwindling, production, figures, the, result, was, that, while, by, the, end, of, the, war, the, nationalist, inflation, was, 41, compared, to, 1936, the, republican, one, was, in, triple, digits, the, second, component, of, domestic, resource, was, fiscal, revenue, in, the, nationalist, zone, it, grew, steadily, and, in, the, 2nd, half, of, 1938, it, was, 214, of, the, figure, from, the, 2nd, half, of, 1936, in, the, republican, zone, fiscal, revenues, in, 1937, dropped, to, some, 25, of, revenues, recorded, in, the, proportional, area, in, 1935, but, recovered, slightly, in, 1938, neither, side, re, engineered, the, pre, war, tax, system, differences, resulted, from, dramatic, problems, with, tax, collection, in, the, republican, zone, and, from, the, course, of, the, war, as, more, and, more, of, the, population, were, governed, by, the, nationalists, a, smaller, percentage, of, domestic, resources, came, from, expropriations, donations, or, internal, borrowing, foreign, resources, amounted, to, 37, in, case, of, the, nationalists, 0, 76bn, and, 41, in, case, of, the, republicans, 0, 77bn, for, the, nationalists, it, was, mostly, the, italian, and, german, credit, in, case, of, the, republicans, it, was, sales, of, gold, reserves, mostly, to, the, ussr, and, in, much, smaller, amount, to, france, none, of, the, sides, resolved, to, public, borrowing, and, none, floated, debt, on, foreign, exchange, markets, authors, of, recent, studies, suggest, that, given, nationalist, and, republican, spendings, were, comparable, earlier, theory, pointing, to, republican, mismanagement, of, resources, is, no, longer, tenable, instead, they, claim, that, the, republicans, failed, to, translate, their, resources, into, military, victory, largely, because, of, constraints, of, the, international, non, intervention, agreement, they, were, forced, to, spend, in, excess, of, market, prices, and, accept, goods, of, lower, quality, initial, turmoil, in, the, republican, zone, contributed, to, problems, while, at, later, stages, the, course, of, the, war, meant, that, population, territory, and, resources, kept, shrinking, given, the, lack, of, operativeness, of, the, republican, army, after, the, fascist, coup, d, tat, the, columns, of, militiamen, temporarily, played, their, role, there, was, also, an, expedition, supported, by, the, generalitat, de, catalunya, to, recover, mallorca, the, lack, of, support, from, the, spanish, government, for, the, underlying, cause, of, the, generalitat, being, involved, into, the, operation, and, the, catalanist, propaganda, that, promoted, the, enlistment, of, volunteers, forced, the, withdrawal, president, aza, a, would, describe, the, initiative, as, that, crazy, operation, was, born, from, the, tyrannical, vanity, petulance, and, deviant, ambition, of, some, barcelona, politicians, not, recapturing, mallorca, would, be, of, great, importance, in, the, future, course, of, the, war, the, republic, prevented, from, buying, weapons, abroad, by, the, international, agreement, of, neutrality, which, both, germany, and, italy, ignored, urgently, required, war, material, in, this, context, the, generalitat, built, a, network, of, war, industries, converting, civilian, industries, when, the, republican, government, moved, to, barcelona, in, 1937, it, took, control, of, the, war, industries, from, the, generalitat, but, under, his, control, production, dropped, dramatically, with, the, consequent, impact, on, supplies, to, the, war, fronts, while, this, was, happening, prime, minister, negr, n, treated, president, companys, with, notable, disloyalty, to, the, final, point, of, abandoning, him, at, the, french, border, after, appropriating, the, generalitat, s, reserve, funds, for, exile, all, of, above, can, be, illustrated, with, negr, n, s, statement, collected, by, juli, n, zugazagoitia, i, am, not, waging, war, against, franco, so, that, a, stupid, and, sleazy, separatism, will, return, to, us, in,

to, nationalist, campaigns, that, lead, us, to, dismemberment, that, i, in, no, way, admit, i, would, give, way, to, franco, without, any, other, condition, than, to, get, aside, the, germans, and, italians, the, death, toll, of, the, spanish, civil, war, is, far, from, clear, and, remains, especially, in, part, related, to, war, and, postwar, repression, a, very, controversial, issue, many, general, historiographic, works, notably, in, spain, refrain, from, advancing, any, figures, massive, historical, series, encyclopedias, or, dictionaries, provide, no, numbers, or, at, best, propose, vague, general, descriptions, more, detailed, general, history, accounts, produced, by, expert, spanish, scholars, often, remain, silent, on, the, issue, foreign, scholars, especially, english, speaking, historians, are, more, willing, to, offer, some, general, estimates, though, some, have, revised, their, projections, usually, downward, and, the, figures, vary, from, 1, million, to, 250, 000, apart, from, bias, ill, will, incompetence, or, changing, access, to, sources, the, differences, result, chiefly, from, categorisation, and, methodology, issues, the, totals, advanced, usually, include, or, exclude, various, categories, scholars, who, focus, on, killings, or, violent, deaths, most, typically, list, 1, combat, and, combat, related, deaths, figures, in, this, rubric, range, from, 100, 000, to, 700, 000, 2, rearguard, terror, both, judicial, and, extrajudicial, recorded, until, the, end, of, the, civil, war, 103, 000, to, 235, 000, 3, civilian, deaths, from, military, action, typically, air, raids, 10, 000, to, 15, 000, these, categories, combined, point, to, totals, from, 235, 000, to, 715, 000, many, authors, opt, for, a, broader, view, and, calculate, death, toll, by, adding, also, 4, above, the, norm, deaths, caused, by, malnutrition, hygiene, shortcomings, cold, illness, etc, recorded, until, the, end, of, the, civil, war, 30, 000, to, 630, 000, it, is, not, unusual, to, encounter, war, statistics, which, include, 5, postwar, terror, related, to, civil, war, at, times, up, to, the, year, of, 1961, 23, 000, to, 200, 000, some, authors, also, add, 6,

aran, 4, 000, 9, above, the, norm, deaths, caused, by, malnutrition, etc, recorded, after, the, civil, war, but, related, to, it, 160, 000, to, 300, 000, demographers, take, an, entirely, different, approach, instead, of, adding, up, deaths, from, different, categories, they, try, to, gauge, the, difference, between, the, total, number, of, deaths, recorded, during, the, war, and, the, total, that, would, result, from, applying, annual, death, averages, from, the, 1926, 1935, period, this, difference, is, considered, excess, death, resulting, from, the, war, the, figure, they, arrive, at, for, the, 1936, 1939, period, is, 346, 000, the, figure, for, 1936, 1942, including, the, years, of, postwar, deaths, resulting, from, terror, and, war, sufferings, is, 540, 000, some, scholars, go, even, further, and, calculate, the, war, s, population, loss, or, demographic, impact, in, this, case, they, might, include, also, 10, migration, abroad, 160, 000, to, 730, 000, and, 11, decrease, in, birth, rate, 500, 000, to, 570, 000, death, totals, remain, debated, british, historian, antony, beevor, wrote, in, his, history, of, the, civil, war, that, franco, s, ensuing, white, terror, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, 200, 000, people, and, that, the, red, terror, killed, 38, 000, julius, ruiz, contends, that, although, the, figures, remain, disputed, a, minimum, of, 37, 843, executions, were, carried, out, in, the, republican, zone, with, a, maximum, of, 150, 000, executions, including, 50, 000, after, the, war, in, nationalist, spain, historian, michael, seidman, stated, that, the, nationalists, killed, approximately, 130, 000, people, and, the, republicans, approximately, 50, 000, people, in, 2008, a, spanish, judge, baltasar, garz, n, opened, an, investigation, into, the, executions, and, disappearances, of, 114, 266, people, between, 17, july, 1936, and, december, 1951, among, the, executions, investigated, was, that, of, the, poet, and, dramatist, federico, garc, a, lorca, whose, body, has, never, been, found, mention, of, garc, a, lorca, s, death, was, forbidden, during, franco, s, regime, research, since, 2016, has, started, to, locate, mass, graves, using, a, combination, of, witness, testimony, remote, sensing, and, forensic, geophysics, techniques, historians, such, as, helen, graham, paul, preston, antony, beevor, gabriel, jackson, and, hugh, thomas, argue, that, the, mass, executions, behind, the, nationalist, lines, were, organised, and, approved, by, the, nationalist, rebel, authorities, while, the, executions, behind, the, republican, lines, were, the, result, of, the, breakdown, of, the, republican, state, and, chaos, though, there, was, much, wanton, killing, in, rebel, spain, the, idea, of, the, limpieza, the, cleaning, up, of, the, country, from, the, evils, which, had, overtaken, it, was, a, disciplined, policy, of, the, new, authorities, and, a, part, of, their, programme, of, regeneration, in, republican, spain, most, of, the, killing, was, the, consequence, of, anarchy, the, outcome, of, a, national, breakdown, and, not, the, work, of, the, state, although, some, political, parties, in, some, cities, abetted, the, enormities, and, some, of, those, responsible, ultimately, rose, to, positions, of, authority, conversely, historians, such, as, stanley, payne, julius, ruiz, and, jos, s, nchez, argue, that, the, political, violence, in, the, republican, zone, was, in, fact, organized, by, the, left, in, general, this, was, not, an, irrepressible, outpouring, of, hatred, by, the, man, in, the, street, for, his, oppressors, as, it, has, sometimes, been, painted, but, a, semi, organized, activity, carried, out, by, sections, of, nearly, all, the, leftist, groups, in, the, entire, leftist, zone, the, only, organized, political, party, that, eschewed, involvement, in, such, activity, were, the, basque, nationalists, nationalist, atrocities, which, authorities, frequently, ordered, so, as, to, eradicate, any, trace, of, leftism, in, spain, were, common, the, notion, of, a, limpieza, cleansing, formed, an, essential, part, of, the, rebel, strategy, and, the, process, began, immediately, after, an, area, had, been, captured, estimates, of, the, death, toll, vary, historian, paul, preston, estimates, the, minimum, number, of, those, executed, by, the, rebels, as, 130, 000, while, antony, beevor, places, the, figure, much, higher, at, an, estimated, 200, 000, dead, the, violence, was, carried, out, in, the, rebel, zone, by, the, military, the, civil, guard, and, the, falange, in, the, name, of, the, regime, julius, ruiz, reports, that, the, nationalists, killed, 100, 000, people, during, the, war, and, executed, at, least, 28, 000, immediately, after, the, first, three, months, of, the, war, were, the, bloodiest, with, 50, to, 70, percent, of, all, executions, carried, out, by, franco, s, regime, from, 1936, to, 1975, occurring, during, this, period, the, first, few, months, of, killings, lacked, much, in, the, way, of, centralisation, being, largely, in, the, hands, of, local, commanders, according, to, stanely, payne, and, jes, s, palacios, general, mola, was, taken, aback, by, them, despite, his, own, planning, emphasising, the, need, for, violence, early, in, the, conflict, he, had, ordered, a, group, of, leftist, militiamen, to, be, immediately, executed, only, to, change, his, mind, and, rescind, the, order, many, such, acts, were, committed, by, reactionary, groups, during, the, first, weeks, of, the, war, this, included, the, execution, of, schoolteachers, because, the, efforts, of, the, second, spanish, republic, to, promote, laicism, and, displace, the, church, from, schools, by, closing, religious, educational, institutions, were, considered, by, the, nationalists, as, an, attack, on, the, roman, catholic, church, extensive, killings, of, civilians, were, carried, out, in, the, cities, captured, by, the, nationalists, along, with, the, execution, of, unwanted, individuals, these, included, non, combatants, such, as, trade, unionists, popular, front, politicians, suspected, freemasons, basque, catalan, andalusian, and, galician, nationalists, republican, intellectuals, relatives, of, known, republicans, and, those, suspected, of, voting, for, the, popular, front, the, nationalists, also, frequently, killed, military, officers, who, refused, to, support, them, in, the, early, days, of, the, coup, many, killings, in, the, first, few, months, were, often, done, by, vigilantes, and, civilian, death, squads, with, the, nationalist, leadership, often, condoning, their, actions, or, even, assisting, them, post, war, executions, were, conducted, by, military, tribunal, though, the, accused, had, limited, ways, to, defend, themselves, a, large, number, of, the, executed, were, done, so, for, their, political, activities, or, positions, they, held, under, the, republic, during, the, war, though, those, who, committed, their, own, killings, under, the, republic, were, also, amongst, executed, as, well, a, 2010, analysis, of, catalonia, argued, that, nationalist, executions, were, more, likely, to, occur, when, they, occupied, an, area, that, experienced, greater, prior, violence, likely, due, to, pro, nationalist, civilians, seeking, revenge, for, earlier, actions, by, denouncing, others, to, the, nationalist, forces, michael, seidman, argues, that, the, nationalists, greater, death, toll, may, be, partially, attributable, to, their, military, success, resulting, in, territorial, gains, and, thus, more, opportunities, to, enact, violence, against, their, enemies, however, during, the, war, executions, declined, as, the, francoist, state, began, to, establish, itself, nationalist, forces, massacred, civilians, in, seville, where, some, 8, 000, people, were, shot, 10, 000, were, killed, in, cordoba, 6, 000, 12, 000, were, killed, in, badajoz, after, more, than, 1, 000, landowners, and, conservatives, were, killed, by, the, revolutionaries, in, granada, where, working, class, neighbourhoods, were, hit, with, artillery, and, right, wing, squads, were, given, free, rein, to, kill, government, sympathizers, at, least, 2, 000, people, were, murdered, in, february, 1937, over, 7, 000, were, killed, after, the, capture, of, m, laga, when, bilbao, was, conquered, thousands, of, people, were, sent, to, prison, there, were, fewer, executions, than, usual, however, because, of, the, effect, guernica, left, on, nationalists, reputations, internationally, the, numbers, killed, as, the, columns, of, the, army, of, africa, devastated, and, pillaged, their, way, between, seville, and, madrid, are, particularly, difficult, to, calculate, landowners, who, owned, the, large, estates, of, southern, spain, rode, alongside, the, army, of, africa, to, reclaim, via, force, of, arms, the, land, given, to, the, landless, peasants, by, the, republican, government, rural, workers, were, executed, and, it, was, mockingly, joked, that, they, had, received, their, land, reform, in, the, form, of, a, burial, plot, nationalists, also, murdered, catholic, clerics, in, one, particular, incident, following, the, capture, of, bilbao, they, took, hundreds, of, people, including, 16, priests, who, had, served, as, chaplains, for, the, republican, forces, to, the, countryside, or, graveyards, and, murdered, them, franco, s, forces, also, persecuted, protestants, including, murdering, 20, protestant, ministers, franco, s, forces, were, determined, to, remove, the, protestant, heresy, from, spain, the, nationalists, also, persecuted, basques, as, they, strove, to, eradicate, basque, culture, according, to, basque, sources, some, 22, 000, basques, were, murdered, by, nationalists, immediately, after, the, civil, war, the, nationalist, side, conducted, aerial, bombing, of, cities, in, republican, territory, carried, out, mainly, by, the, luftwaffe, volunteers, of, the, condor, legion, and, the, italian, air, force, volunteers, of, the, corpo, truppe, volontarie, madrid, barcelona, valencia, guernica, durango, and, other, cities, were, attacked, the, bombing, of, guernica, was, the, most, controversial, the, italian, air, force, conducted, a, particularly, heavy, bombing, raid, on, barcelona, in, early, 1938, while, some, nationalist, leaders, did, oppose, the, bombing, of, the, city, for, example, generals, yag, e, and, moscard, who, were, noted, for, being, nonconformists, protested, against, the, indiscriminate, destruction, other, nationalist, leaders, often, those, of, a, fascist, persuasion, approved, of, the, bombings, which, they, saw, as, necessary, to, cleanse, barcelona, michael, seidman, observes, that, the, nationalist, terror, was, a, key, part, of, the, nationalist, victory, as, it, allowed, them, to, secure, their, rear, the, russian, whites, in, their, civil, war, had, struggled, to, suppress, peasant, rebellions, bandits, and, warlordism, behind, their, lines, british, observers, argued, that, if, the, russian, whites, had, been, able, to, secure, law, and, order, behind, their, lines, they, would, have, won, over, the, russian, peasantry, while, the, inability, of, the, chinese, nationalists, to, stop, banditry, during, the, chinese, civil, war, did, severe, damage, to, the, regime, s, legitimacy, the, spanish, nationalists, in, contrast, imposed, a, puritanically, terrorist, order, on, the, populace, in, their, territory, they, never, suffered, from, serious, partisan, activity, behind, their, lines, and, the, fact, that, banditry, did, not, develop, into, a, serious, problem, in, spain, despite, how, easy, it, would, have, been, in, such, mountainous, terrain, demands, explanation, seidman, argues, that, severe, terror, combined, with, control, of, the, food, supply, explains, the, general, lack, of, guerilla, warfare, in, the, nationalist, rear, a, 2009, analysis, of, nationalist, violence, argues, that, evidence, supports, the, view, that, killings, were, used, strategically, by, the, nationalists, to, pre, emptively, counter, potential, opposition, by, targeting, individuals, and, groups, deemed, most, likely, to, cultivate, future, rebellions, thus, helping, the, nationalists, win, the, war, scholars, have, estimated, that, between, 38, 000, and, 70, 000, civilians, were, killed, in, republican, held, territories, with, the, most, common, estimate, being, around, 50, 000, whatever, the, exact, number, the, death, toll, was, far, exaggerated, by, both, sides, for, propaganda, reasons, giving, birth, to, the, legend, of, the, mill, n, de, muertos, franco, s, government, would, later, give, names, of, 61, 000, victims, of, the, red, terrors, but, which, are, not, considered, objectively, verifiable, the, deaths, would, form, the, prevailing, outside, opinion, of, the, republic, up, until, the, bombing, of, guernica, the, leftist, revolution, of, 1936, that, preceded, the, war, was, accompanied, since, the, first, months, by, an, escalation, of, leftist, anticlerical, terror, that, between, 18, and, 31, july, alone, killed, 839, religious, continuing, during, the, month, of, august, with, 2055, other, victims, including, 10, bishops, killed, that, was, 42, of, the, total, number, of, registered, victims, in, that, year, particularly, noteworthy, repression, was, conducted, in, madrid, during, the, war, the, republican, government, was, anticlerical, and, when, the, war, began, supporters, attacked, and, murdered, roman, catholic, clergy, in, reaction, to, the, news, of, military, revolt, in, his, 1961, book, spanish, archbishop, antonio, montero, moreno, who, at, the, time, was, director, of, the, journal, ecclesia, wrote, that, 6, 832, were, killed, during, the, war, including, 4, 184, priests, 2, 365, monks, and, friars, and, 283, nuns, many, were, first, raped, before, they, died, in, addition, to, 13, bishops, a, figure, accepted, by, historians, including, beevor, some, of, the, killings, were, carried, out, with, extreme, cruelty, some, were, burned, to, death, there, are, reports, of, castration, and, disembowelment, some, sources, claim, that, by, the, conflict, s, end, 20, percent, of, the, nation, s, clergy, had, been, killed, the, execution, of, the, sacred, heart, of, jesus, by, communist, militiamen, at, cerro, de, los, ngeles, near, madrid, on, 7, august, 1936, was, the, most, infamous, of, widespread, desecration, of, religious, property, in, dioceses, where, the, republicans, had, general, control, a, large, proportion, often, a, majority, of, secular, priests, were, killed, michael, seidman, argues, that, the, hatred, of, the, republicans, for, the, clergy, was, in, excess, of, anything, else, while, local, revolutionaries, might, spare, the, lives, of, the, rich, and, right, wingers, they, seldom, offered, the, same, to, priests, like, clergy, civilians, were, executed, in, republican, territories, some, civilians, were, executed, as, suspected, falangists, others, died, in, acts, of, revenge, after, republicans, heard, of, massacres, carried, out, in, the, nationalist, zone, even, families, who, simply, attended, catholic, mass, were, hunted, down, including, children, air, raids, committed, against, republican, cities, were, another, driving, factor, shopkeepers, and, industrialists, were, shot, if, they, did, not, sympathise, with, the, republicans, and, were, usually, spared, if, they, did, fake, justice, was, sought, through, commissions, named, checas, after, the, soviet, secret, police, organization, many, killings, were, done, by, paseos, impromptu, death, squads, that, emerged, as, a, spontaneous, practice, amongst, revolutionary, activists, in, republican, areas, according, to, seidman, the, republican, government, only, made, efforts, to, stop, the, actions, of, the, paseos, late, in, the, war, during, the, first, few, months, the, government, either, tolerated, it, or, made, no, efforts, to, stop, it, the, killings, often, contained, a, symbolic, element, as, those, killed, were, seen, as, embodying, an, oppressive, source, of, power, and, authority, this, was, also, why, the, republicans, would, kill, priests, or, employers, who, were, not, considered, to, personally, have, done, anything, wrong, but, were, nonetheless, seen, as, representing, the, old, oppressive, order, that, needed, to, be, destroyed, there, was, infighting, between, the, republican, factions, and, the, communists, following, stalinism, declared, the, workers, party, of, marxist, unification, poum, an, anti, stalinist, communist, party, to, be, an, illegal, organization, along, with, the, anarchists, the, stalinists, betrayed, and, committed, mass, atrocities, on, the, other, republican, factions, such, as, torture, and, mass, executions, george, orwell, would, record, this, in, his, homage, to, catalonia, as, well, as, write, nineteen, eighty, four, and, animal, farm, to, criticize, stalinism, as, pressure, mounted, with, the, increasing, success, of, the, nationalists, many, civilians, were, executed, by, councils, and, tribunals, controlled, by, competing, communist, and, anarchist, groups, some, members, of, the, latter, were, executed, by, soviet, advised, communist, functionaries, in, catalonia, as, recounted, by, george, orwell, s, description, of, the, purges, in, barcelona, in, 1937, in, which, followed, a, period, of, increasing, tension, between, competing, elements, of, the, catalan, political, scene, some, individuals, fled, to, friendly, embassies, which, would, house, up, to, 8, 500, people, during, the, war, in, the, andalusian, town, of, ronda, 512, suspected, nationalists, were, executed, in, the, first, month, of, the, war, communist, santiago, carrillo, solares, was, accused, of, the, killing, of, nationalists, in, the, paracuellos, massacre, near, paracuellos, de, jarama, pro, soviet, communists, committed, numerous, atrocities, against, fellow, republicans, including, other, marxists, andr, marty, known, as, the, butcher, of, albacete, was, responsible, for, the, deaths, of, some, 500, members, of, the, international, brigades, andr, s, nin, leader, of, the, poum, workers, party, of, marxist, unification, and, many, other, prominent, poum, members, were, murdered, by, the, communists, with, the, help, of, the, ussr, s, nkvd, the, republicans, also, conducted, their, own, bombing, attacks, on, cities, such, as, the, bombing, of, cabra, according, to, stanley, payne, and, jes, s, palacios, the, republicans, conducted, more, indiscriminate, air, raids, on, cities, and, civilian, targets, than, the, nationalists, although, their, attacks, were, often, weak, and, ineffective, michael, seidman, argues, that, the, better, trained, nationalist, air, force, was, more, effective, at, inflicting, casualties, killing, an, estimated, 11, 000, civilians, compared, to, approximately, 4, 000, for, the, republican, air, force, 38, 000, people, were, killed, in, the, republican, zone, during, the, war, 17, 000, of, whom, were, killed, in, madrid, or, catalonia, within, a, month, of, the, coup, whilst, the, communists, were, forthright, in, their, support, of, extrajudicial, killings, much, of, the, republican, side, was, appalled, by, the, murders, aza, a, came, close, to, resigning, he, alongside, other, members, of, parliament, and, a, great, number, of, other, local, officials, attempted, to, prevent, nationalist, supporters, from, being, lynched, some, of, those, in, positions, of, power, intervened, personally, to, stop, the, killings, in, the, anarchist, controlled, areas, aragon, and, catalonia, in, addition, to, the, temporary, military, success, there, was, a, vast, social, revolution, in, which, the, workers, and, peasants, collectivised, land, and, industry, and, set, up, councils, parallel, to, the, paralyzed, republican, government, this, revolution, was, opposed, by, the, soviet, supported, communists, who, campaigned, against, the, loss, of, civil, property, rights, as, the, war, progressed, the, government, and, the, communists, were, able, to, exploit, their, access, to, soviet, arms, to, restore, government, control, over, the, war, effort, through, diplomacy, and, force, anarchists, and, the, workers, party, of, marxist, unification, partido, obrero, de, unificaci, n, marxista, poum, were, integrated, into, the, regular, army, albeit, with, resistance, the, poum, trotskyists, were, outlawed, and, denounced, by, the, soviet, aligned, communists, as, an, instrument, of, the, fascists, in, the, may, days, of, 1937, many, thousands, of, anarchist, and, communist, republican, soldiers, fought, for, control, of, strategic, points, in, barcelona, the, pre, war, falange, was, a, small, party, of, some, 30, 000, 40, 000, members, it, also, called, for, a, social, revolution, that, would, have, seen, spanish, society, transformed, by, national, syndicalism, following, the, execution, of, its, leader, jos, antonio, primo, de, rivera, by, the, republicans, the, party, swelled, in, size, to, several, hundred, thousand, members, the, leadership, of, the, falange, suffered, 60, percent, casualties, in, the, early, days, of, the, civil, war, and, the, party, was, transformed, by, new, members, and, rising, new, leaders, called, camisas, nuevas, new, shirts, who, were, less, interested, in, the, revolutionary, aspects, of,

sides, due, to, the, complex, history, of, the, army, and, spanish, colonialism, in, north, africa, both, sides, would, invent, different, characters, of, the, moorish, troops, drawing, on, a, wide, range, of, historical, symbols, cultural, prejudices, and, racial, stereotypes, the, army, of, africa, would, be, used, as, part, of, a, propaganda, campaign, by, both, sides, to, portray, the, other, side, as, foreign, invaders, attacking, from, outside, the, national, community, while, portraying, their, own, as, representing, true, spain, costs, for, the, war, on, both, sides, were, very, high, monetary, resources, on, the, republican, side, were, completely, drained, from, weapons, acquisition, on, the, nationalist, side, the, biggest, losses, came, after, the, conflict, when, they, had, to, let, germany, exploit, the, country, s, mining, resources, so, until, the, beginning, of, world, war, ii, they, barely, had, the, chance, to, make, any, profit, the, number, of, civilian, victims, is, still, being, discussed, with, some, estimating, approximately, 500, 000, victims, while, others, go, as, high, as, 1, 000, 000, these, deaths, were, not, only, due, to, combat, but, also, executions, which, were, especially, well, organised, and, systematic, on, the, nationalist, side, being, more, disorganised, on, the, republican, side, mainly, caused, by, loss, of, control, of, the, armed, masses, by, the, government, however, the, 500, 000, death, toll, does, not, include, deaths, by, malnutrition, hunger, or, diseases, brought, about, by, the, war, after, the, war, the, francoist, regime, initiated, a, repressive, process, against, the, losing, side, a, cleansing, of, sorts, against, anything, or, anyone, associated, with, the, republic, this, process, led, many, to, exile, or, death, exile, happened, in, three, waves, the, first, one, was, during, the, northern, campaign, march, november, 1937, followed, by, a, second, wave, called, la, retirada, after, the, fall, of, catalonia, january, february, 1939, in, which, about, 500, 000, people, fled, to, france, the, french, authorities, had, to, improvise, concentration, camps, with, such, hard, conditions, that, almost, half, of, the, exiled, spaniards, returned, the, third, wave, occurred, after, the, war, at, the, end, of, march, 1939, when, thousands, of, republicans, tried, to, board, ships, to, exile, although, few, succeeded, the, political, and, emotional, repercussions, of, the, war, transcended, the, national, scale, becoming, a, precursor, to, the, second, world, war, the, war, has, frequently, been, described, by, historians, as, the, prelude, to, or, the, opening, round, of, the, second, world, war, as, part, of, an, international, battle, against, fascism, historian, stanley, payne, suggests, that, this, view, is, an, incorrect, summary, of, the, geopolitic, position, of, the, interwar, period, arguing, that, the, international, alliance, that, was, created, in, december, 1941, once, the, united, states, entered, the, second, world, war, was, politically, much, broader, than, the, spanish, popular, front, the, spanish, civil, war, payne, argues, was, thus, a, far, more, clear, cut, revolutionary, and, counter, revolutionary, struggle, between, the, left, and, right, wings, while, the, second, world, war, initially, had, fascists, and, communist, powers, on, the, same, side, with, the, combined, nazi, soviet, invasion, of, poland, payne, suggests, that, instead, the, civil, war, was, the, last, of, the, revolutionary, crises, that, emerged, from, the, first, world, war, observing, it, had, parallels, such, as, the, complete, revolutionary, breakdown, of, domestic, institutions, the, development, of, full, scale, revolutionary, and, counter, revolutionary, struggles, the, development, of, a, typical, post, ww1, communist, force, in, the, form, of, the, people, s, army, an, extreme, exacerbation, of, nationalism, the, frequent, use, of, ww1, style, military, weapons, and, tactics, and, the, fact, that, it, was, not, the, product, of, the, plan, of, any, of, the, major, powers, making, it, more, similar, to, the, post, ww1, crises, which, arose, after, the, treaty, of, versailles, after, the, war, spanish, policy, leaned, heavily, towards, germany, portugal, and, italy, since, they, had, been, the, greatest, nationalist, supporters, and, aligned, with, spain, ideologically, however, the, end, of, the, civil, war, and, later, the, second, world, war, saw, the, isolation, of, the, country, from, most, other, nations, until, the, 1950s, in, which, the, american, anti, communist, international, policy, favoured, having, a, far, right, and, extremely, anti, communist, ally, in, europe, there, have, been, numerous, attempts, to, define, the, spanish, civil, war, in, terms, of, its, key, mechanism, prevailing, logic, and, dominant, conflict, line, many, of, these, interpretations, strove, also, to, identify, the, conflict, in, terms, of, major, threads, of, continental, or, even, global, history, these, attempts, might, not, differ, much, from, propaganda, advanced, by, both, warring, parties, or, their, sympathizers, they, might, form, part, of, broad, public, discourse, either, in, spain, or, abroad, they, might, also, belong, to, professional, academic, historiographic, debate, major, theories,
