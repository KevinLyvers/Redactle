and, the, far, east, since, the, reign, of, ivan, the, terrible, in, the, 16th, century, since, the, end, of, the, first, sino, japanese, war, in, 1895, japan, had, feared, russian, encroachment, would, interfere, with, its, plans, to, establish, a, sphere, of, influence, in, korea, and, manchuria, seeing, russia, as, a, rival, japan, offered, to, recognize, russian, dominance, in, manchuria, in, exchange, for, recognition, of, the, korean, empire, as, being, within, the, japanese, sphere, of, influence, russia, refused, and, demanded, the, establishment, of, a, neutral, buffer, zone, between, russia, and, japan, in, korea, north, of, the, 39th, parallel, the, imperial, japanese, government, perceived, this, as, obstructing, their, plans, for, expansion, into, mainland, asia, and, chose, to, go, to, war, after, negotiations, broke, down, in, 1904, the, imperial, japanese, navy, opened, hostilities, in, a, surprise, attack, on, the, russian, eastern, fleet, at, port, arthur, china, on, 9, february, 1904, the, russian, empire, responded, by, declaring, war, on, japan, although, russia, suffered, a, number, of, defeats, emperor, nicholas, ii, remained, convinced, that, russia, could, still, win, if, it, fought, on, he, chose, to, remain, engaged, in, the, war, and, await, the, outcomes, of, key, naval, battles, as, hope, of, victory, dissipated, he, continued, the, war, to, preserve, the, dignity, of, russia, by, averting, a, humiliating, peace, russia, ignored, japan, s, willingness, early, on, to, agree, to, an, armistice, and, rejected, the, idea, of, bringing, the, dispute, to, the, permanent, court, of, arbitration, at, the, hague, after, the, decisive, naval, battle, of, tsushima, the, war, was, concluded, with, the, treaty, of, portsmouth, 5, september, 1905, mediated, by, us, president, theodore, roosevelt, the, complete, victory, of, the, japanese, military, surprised, international, observers, and, transformed, the, balance, of, power, in, both, east, asia, and, europe, resulting, in, japan, s, emergence, as, a, great, power, and, a, decline, in, the, russian, empire, s, prestige, and, influence, in, europe, russia, s, incurrence, of, substantial, casualties, and, losses, for, a, cause, that, resulted, in, humiliating, defeat, contributed, to, growing, domestic, unrest, which, culminated, in, the, 1905, russian, revolution, and, severely, damaged, the, prestige, of, the, russian, autocracy, after, the, meiji, restoration, in, 1868, the, meiji, government, endeavoured, to, assimilate, western, ideas, technological, advances, and, ways, of, warfare, by, the, late, 19th, century, japan, had, transformed, itself, into, a, modernized, industrial, state, the, japanese, wanted, to, be, recognized, as, equal, with, the, western, powers, the, meiji, restoration, had, been, intended, to, make, japan, a, modernized, state, not, a, westernized, one, and, japan, was, an, imperialist, power, looking, towards, overseas, expansionism, in, the, years, 1869, 1873, the, seikanron, conquer, korea, argument, had, bitterly, divided, the, japanese, elite, one, faction, wanted, to, conquer, korea, immediately, another, wanted, to, wait, until, japan, was, further, modernized, before, embarking, on, a, war, to, conquer, korea, significantly, no, one, in, the, japanese, elite, ever, accepted, the, idea, that, the, koreans, had, the, right, to, be, independent, with, only, the, question, of, timing, dividing, the, two, factions, in, much, the, same, way, that, europeans, used, the, backwardness, of, african, and, asian, nations, as, a, reason, for, why, they, had, to, conquer, them, for, the, japanese, elite, the, backwardness, of, china, and, korea, was, proof, of, the, inferiority, of, those, nations, thus, giving, the, japanese, the, right, to, conquer, them, count, inoue, kaoru, the, foreign, minister, gave, a, speech, in, 1887, saying, what, we, must, do, is, to, transform, our, empire, and, our, people, make, the, empire, like, the, countries, of, europe, and, our, people, like, the, peoples, of, europe, going, on, to, say, that, the, chinese, and, koreans, had, essentially, forfeited, their, right, to, be, independent, by, not, modernizing, much, of, the, pressure, for, an, aggressive, foreign, policy, in, japan, came, from, below, with, the, advocates, of, a, people, s, rights, movement, calling, for, an, elected, parliament, also, favouring, an, ultra, nationalist, line, that, took, it, for, granted, the, japanese, had, the, right, to, annex, korea, as, the, people, s, rights, movement, was, led, by, those, who, favoured, invading, korea, in, the, years, 1869, 1873, as, part, of, the, modernization, process, in, japan, social, darwinist, ideas, about, the, survival, of, the, fittest, were, common, from, the, 1880s, onward, and, many, ordinary, japanese, resented, the, heavy, taxes, imposed, by, the, government, to, modernize, japan, demanding, something, tangible, like, an, overseas, colony, as, a, reward, for, their, sacrifices, furthermore, the, educational, system, of, meiji, japan, was, meant, to, train, the, schoolboys, to, be, soldiers, when, they, grew, up, and, as, such, japanese, schools, indoctrinated, their, students, into, bushid, way, of, the, warrior, the, fierce, code, of, the, samurai, having, indoctrinated, the, younger, generations, into, bushid, the, meiji, elite, found, themselves, faced, with, a, people, who, clamored, for, war, and, regarded, diplomacy, as, a, weakness, the, british, japanologist, richard, storry, wrote, that, the, biggest, misconception, about, japan, in, the, west, was, that, the, japanese, people, were, the, docile, instruments, of, the, elite, when, in, fact, much, of, the, pressure, for, japan, s, wars, from, 1894, to, 1941, came, from, the, ordinary, people, who, demanded, a, tough, foreign, policy, and, tended, to, engage, in, riots, and, assassination, when, foreign, policy, was, perceived, to, be, pusillanimous, though, the, meiji, oligarchy, refused, to, allow, liberal, democracy, they, did, seek, to, appropriate, some, of, the, demands, of, the, people, s, rights, movement, by, allowing, an, elected, imperial, diet, in, 1890, with, limited, powers, and, an, equally, limited, franchise, and, by, pursuing, an, aggressive, foreign, policy, towards, korea, in, 1884, japan, had, encouraged, a, coup, in, the, kingdom, of, korea, by, a, pro, japanese, reformist, faction, which, led, to, the, conservative, government, calling, upon, china, for, help, leading, to, a, clash, between, chinese, and, japanese, soldiers, in, seoul, at, the, time, tokyo, did, not, feel, ready, to, risk, a, war, with, china, and, the, crisis, was, ended, by, the, convention, of, tientsin, which, left, korea, more, strongly, in, the, chinese, sphere, of, influence, though, it, did, give, the, japanese, the, right, to, intervene, in, korea, all, through, the, 1880s, and, early, 1890s, the, government, in, tokyo, was, regularly, criticized, for, not, being, aggressive, enough, in, korea, leading, japanese, historian, masao, maruyama, to, write, just, as, japan, was, subject, to, pressure, from, the, great, powers, so, she, would, apply, pressure, to, still, weaker, countries, a, clear, case, of, the, transfer, psychology, in, this, regard, it, is, significant, that, ever, since, the, meiji, period, demands, for, a, tough, foreign, policy, have, come, from, the, common, people, that, is, from, those, who, are, at, the, receiving, end, of, oppression, at, home, tsarist, russia, as, a, major, imperial, power, had, ambitions, in, the, east, by, the, 1890s, it, had, extended, its, realm, across, central, asia, to, afghanistan, absorbing, local, states, in, the, process, the, russian, empire, stretched, from, poland, in, the, west, to, the, kamchatka, peninsula, in, the, east, with, its, construction, of, the, trans, siberian, railway, to, the, port, of, vladivostok, russia, hoped, to, further, consolidate, its, influence, and, presence, in, the, region, in, the, tsushima, incident, of, 1861, russia, had, directly, assaulted, japanese, territory, the, first, major, war, the, empire, of, japan, fought, following, the, meiji, restoration, was, against, china, from, 1894, to, 1895, the, war, revolved, around, the, issue, of, control, and, influence, over, korea, under, the, rule, of, the, joseon, dynasty, from, the, 1880s, onward, there, had, been, vigorous, competition, for, influence, in, korea, between, china, and, japan, the, korean, court, was, prone, to, factionalism, and, at, the, time, was, badly, divided, between, a, reformist, camp, that, was, pro, japanese, and, a, more, conservative, faction, that, was, pro, chinese, in, 1884, a, pro, japanese, coup, attempt, was, put, down, by, chinese, troops, and, a, residency, under, general, yuan, shikai, was, established, in, seoul, a, peasant, rebellion, led, by, the, tonghak, religious, movement, led, to, a, request, by, the, korean, government, for, the, qing, dynasty, to, send, in, troops, to, stabilize, the, country, the, empire, of, japan, responded, by, sending, their, own, force, to, korea, to, crush, the, tonghak, and, installed, a, puppet, government, in, seoul, china, objected, and, war, ensued, hostilities, proved, brief, with, japanese, ground, troops, routing, chinese, forces, on, the, liaodong, peninsula, and, nearly, destroying, the, chinese, beiyang, fleet, in, the, battle, of, the, yalu, river, japan, and, china, signed, the, treaty, of, shimonoseki, which, ceded, the, liaodong, peninsula, and, the, island, of, taiwan, to, japan, after, the, peace, treaty, russia, germany, and, france, forced, japan, to, withdraw, from, the, liaodong, peninsula, the, leaders, of, japan, did, not, feel, that, they, possessed, the, strength, to, resist, the, combined, might, of, russia, germany, and, france, and, so, gave, in, to, the, ultimatum, at, the, same, time, the, japanese, did, not, abandon, their, attempts, to, force, korea, into, the, japanese, sphere, of, influence, on, 8, october, 1895, queen, min, of, korea, the, leader, of, the, anti, japanese, and, pro, chinese, faction, at, the, korean, court, was, murdered, by, japanese, agents, within, the, halls, of, the, gyeongbokgung, palace, an, act, that, backfired, badly, as, it, turned, korean, public, opinion, against, japan, in, early, 1896, king, gojong, of, korea, fled, to, the, russian, legation, in, seoul, believing, that, his, life, was, in, danger, from, japanese, agents, and, russian, influence, in, korea, started, to, predominate, in, the, aftermath, of, the, flight, of, the, king, a, popular, uprising, overthrew, the, pro, japanese, government, and, several, cabinet, ministers, were, lynched, in, the, streets, in, 1897, russia, occupied, the, liaodong, peninsula, built, the, port, arthur, fortress, and, based, the, russian, pacific, fleet, in, the, port, russia, s, acquisition, of, port, arthur, was, primarily, an, anti, british, move, to, counter, the, british, occupation, of, wei, hai, wei, but, in, japan, this, was, perceived, as, an, anti, japanese, move, germany, occupied, jiaozhou, bay, built, the, tsingtao, fortress, and, based, the, german, east, asia, squadron, in, this, port, between, 1897, and, 1903, the, russians, built, the, chinese, eastern, railway, cer, in, manchuria, the, chinese, eastern, railroad, was, owned, jointly, by, the, russian, and, chinese, governments, but, the, company, s, management, was, entirely, russian, the, line, was, built, to, the, russian, gauge, and, russian, troops, were, stationed, in, manchuria, to, protect, rail, traffic, on, the, cer, from, bandit, attacks, the, headquarters, of, the, cer, company, was, located, in, the, new, russian, built, city, of, harbin, the, moscow, of, the, orient, from, 1897, onwards, manchuria, while, still, nominally, part, of, the, great, qing, empire, started, to, resemble, more, and, more, a, russian, province, in, december, 1897, a, russian, fleet, appeared, off, port, arthur, after, three, months, in, 1898, china, and, russia, negotiated, a, convention, by, which, china, leased, to, russia, port, arthur, talienwan, and, the, surrounding, waters, the, two, parties, further, agreed, that, the, convention, could, be, extended, by, mutual, agreement, the, russians, clearly, expected, such, an, extension, for, they, lost, no, time, in, occupying, the, territory, and, in, fortifying, port, arthur, their, sole, warm, water, port, on, the, pacific, coast, and, of, great, strategic, value, a, year, later, to, consolidate, their, position, the, russians, began, to, build, a, new, railway, from, harbin, through, mukden, to, port, arthur, the, south, manchurian, railroad, the, development, of, the, railway, became, a, contributory, factor, to, the, boxer, rebellion, when, boxer, forces, burned, the,

can, i, allow, japan, to, become, firmly, established, there, that, will, be, a, casus, belli, by, 1898, they, had, acquired, mining, and, forestry, concessions, near, the, yalu, and, tumen, rivers, causing, the, japanese, much, anxiety, japan, decided, to, attack, before, the, russians, completed, the, trans, siberian, railway, the, russians, and, the, japanese, both, contributed, troops, to, the, eight, nation, alliance, sent, in, 1900, to, quell, the, boxer, rebellion, and, to, relieve, the, international, legations, besieged, in, the, chinese, capital, beijing, russia, had, already, sent, 177, 000, soldiers, to, manchuria, nominally, to, protect, its, railways, under, construction, though, the, qing, imperial, army, and, the, boxer, rebels, united, to, fight, against, the, invasion, they, were, quickly, overrun, and, ejected, from, manchuria, after, the, boxer, rebellion, 100, 000, russian, soldiers, were, stationed, in, manchuria, the, russian, troops, settled, in, and, despite, assurances, they, would, vacate, the, area, after, the, crisis, by, 1903, the, russians, had, not, established, a, timetable, for, withdrawal, and, had, actually, strengthened, their, position, in, manchuria, the, japanese, statesman, it, hirobumi, started, to, negotiate, with, the, russians, he, regarded, japan, as, too, weak, to, evict, the, russians, militarily, so, he, proposed, giving, russia, control, over, manchuria, in, exchange, for, japanese, control, of, northern, korea, of, the, five, genr, elder, statesmen, who, made, up, the, meiji, oligarchy, it, hirobumi, and, count, inoue, kaoru, opposed, the, idea, of, war, against, russia, on, financial, grounds, while, katsura, tar, komura, jutar, and, field, marshal, yamagata, aritomo, favored, war, meanwhile, japan, and, britain, had, signed, the, anglo, japanese, alliance, in, 1902, the, british, seeking, to, restrict, naval, competition, by, keeping, the, russian, pacific, seaports, of, vladivostok, and, port, arthur, from, their, full, use, japan, s, alliance, with, the, british, meant, in, part, that, if, any, nation, allied, itself, with, russia, during, any, war, against, japan, then, britain, would, enter, the, war, on, japan, s, side, russia, could, no, longer, count, on, receiving, help, from, either, germany, or, france, without, the, danger, of, british, involvement, in, the, war, with, such, an, alliance, japan, felt, free, to, commence, hostilities, if, necessary, the, 1890s, and, 1900s, marked, the, height, of, the, yellow, peril, propaganda, by, the, german, government, and, the, german, emperor, wilhelm, ii, r, 1888, 1918, often, wrote, letters, to, his, cousin, emperor, nicholas, ii, of, russia, praising, him, as, the, saviour, of, the, white, race, and, urging, russia, forward, in, asia, from, november, 1894, onward, wilhelm, had, been, writing, letters, praising, nicholas, as, europe, s, defender, from, the, yellow, peril, assuring, the, tsar, that, god, himself, had, chosen, russia, to, defend, europe, from, the, alleged, asian, threat, on, 1, november, 1902, wilhelm, wrote, to, nicholas, that, certain, symptoms, in, the, east, seem, to, show, that, japan, is, becoming, a, rather, restless, customer, and, it, is, evident, to, every, unbiased, mind, that, korea, must, and, will, be, russian, wilhelm, ended, his, letter, with, the, warning, that, japan, and, china, would, soon, unite, against, europe, writing, twenty, to, thirty, million, chinese, supported, by, a, half, dozen, japanese, divisions, led, by, competent, intrepid, japanese, officers, full, of, hatred, for, christianity, that, is, a, vision, of, the, future, that, cannot, be, contemplated, without, concern, and, it, is, not, impossible, on, the, contrary, it, is, the, realisation, of, the, yellow, peril, which, i, described, a, few, years, ago, and, i, was, ridiculed, by, the, majority, of, people, for, my, graphic, depiction, of, it, your, devoted, friend, and, cousin, willy, admiral, of, the, atlantic, wilhelm, aggressively, encouraged, russia, s, ambitions, in, asia, because, france, russia, s, closest, ally, since, 1894, was, less, than, supportive, of, russian, expansionism, in, asia, and, it, was, believed, in, berlin, that, german, support, of, russia, might, break, up, the, franco, russian, alliance, and, lead, to, a, new, german, russian, alliance, the, french, had, made, it, clear, that, they, disapproved, of, nicholas, s, forward, policy, in, asia, the, french, premier, maurice, rouvier, in, office, may, to, december, 1887, publicly, declaring, that, the, franco, russian, alliance, applied, only, in, europe, not, to, asia, and, that, france, would, remain, neutral, if, japan, attacked, russia, the, american, president, theodore, roosevelt, in, office, 1901, 1909, who, was, attempting, to, mediate, the, russian, japanese, dispute, complained, that, wilhelm, s, yellow, peril, propaganda, which, strongly, implied, that, germany, might, go, to, war, against, japan, in, support, of, russia, encouraged, russian, intransigence, on, 24, july, 1905, in, a, letter, to, the, british, diplomat, cecil, spring, rice, roosevelt, wrote, that, wilhelm, bore, partial, responsibility, for, the, war, as, he, has, done, all, he, could, to, bring, it, about, charging, that, wilhelm, s, constant, warnings, about, the, yellow, peril, had, made, the, russians, uninterested, in, compromise, as, nicholas, believed, that, germany, would, intervene, if, japan, attacked, the, implicit, promise, of, german, support, suggested, by, wilhelm, s, yellow, peril, speeches, and, letters, to, nicholas, led, many, decision, makers, in, saint, petersburg, to, believe, that, russia, s, military, weaknesses, in, the, far, east, like, the, uncompleted, trans, siberian, railroad, line, did, not, matter, they, assumed, that, the, reich, would, come, to, russia, s, assistance, if, war, should, come, in, fact, neither, wilhelm, nor, his, chancellor, prince, bernhard, von, b, low, in, office, 1900, 1909, had, much, interest, in, east, asia, and, wilhelm, s, letters, to, nicholas, praising, him, as, europe, s, saviour, against, the, yellow, peril, were, really, meant, to, provoke, change, in, the, balance, of, power, in, europe, as, wilhelm, believed, that, any, russian, entanglement, with, japan, would, break, up, the, franco, russian, alliance, and, lead, to, nicholas, signing, an, alliance, with, germany, this, was, especially, the, case, as, germany, had, embarked, upon, the, tirpitz, plan, and, a, policy, of, weltpolitik, from, 1897, meant, to, challenge, britain, s, position, as, the, world, s, leading, power, since, britain, was, allied, to, japan, if, germany, could, manipulate, russia, and, japan, into, going, to, war, with, each, other, this, in, turn, would, allegedly, lead, to, russia, turning, towards, germany, furthermore, wilhelm, believed, if, a, russian, german, alliance, emerged, france, would, be, compelled, to, join, it, he, also, hoped, that, having, russia, pursue, an, expansionist, policy, in, asia, would, distract, and, keep, russia, out, of, the, balkans, thus, removing, the, main, source, of, tension, between, russia, and, germany, s, ally, austria, hungary, during, the, war, nicholas, who, took, at, face, value, wilhelm, s, yellow, peril, speeches, placed, much, hope, in, german, intervention, on, his, side, more, than, once, nicholas, chose, to, continue, the, war, out, of, the, belief, that, the, kaiser, would, come, to, his, aid, despite, previous, assurances, that, russia, would, completely, withdraw, from, manchuria, the, forces, it, had, sent, to, crush, the, boxer, rebellion, by, 8, april, 1903, that, day, passed, with, no, reduction, in, russian, forces, in, that, region, in, japan, university, students, demonstrated, both, against, russia, and, against, their, own, government, for, not, taking, any, action, on, 28, july, 1903, kurino, shin, ichir, the, japanese, minister, in, saint, petersburg, was, instructed, to, present, his, country, s, view, opposing, russia, s, consolidation, plans, in, manchuria, on, 3, august, 1903, the, japanese, minister, handed, in, the, following, document, to, serve, as, the, basis, for, further, negotiations, on, 3, october, 1903, the, russian, minister, to, japan, roman, rosen, presented, to, the, japanese, government, the, russian, counter, proposal, as, the, basis, of, negotiations, as, follows, during, the, russian, japanese, talks, the, japanese, historian, hirono, yoshihiko, noted, once, negotiations, commenced, between, japan, and, russia, russia, scaled, back, its, demands, and, claims, regarding, korea, bit, by, bit, making, a, series, of, concessions, that, japan, regarded, as, serious, compromises, on, russia, s, part, the, war, might, not, have, broken, out, had, not, the, issues, of, korea, and, manchuria, become, linked, the, korean, and, manchurian, issues, had, become, linked, as, the, prime, minister, of, japan, katsura, tar, in, office, 1901, 1906, decided, if, war, did, come, that, japan, was, more, likely, to, have, the, support, of, the, united, states, and, great, britain, if, the, war, could, be, presented, as, a, struggle, for, free, trade, against, the, highly, protectionist, russian, empire, in, which, case, manchuria, which, was, the, larger, market, than, korea, was, more, likely, to, engage, anglo, american, sympathies, throughout, the, war, japanese, propaganda, presented, the, recurring, theme, of, japan, as, a, civilized, power, that, supported, free, trade, and, would, implicitly, allow, foreign, businesses, into, the, resource, rich, region, of, manchuria, vs, russia, the, uncivilized, power, that, was, protectionist, and, wanted, to, keep, the, riches, of, manchuria, all, to, itself, emperor, gojong, of, korea, king, from, 1864, to, 1897, emperor, from, 1897, to, 1907, came, to, believe, that, the, issue, dividing, japan, and, russia, was, manchuria, and, chose, to, pursue, a, policy, of, neutrality, as, the, best, way, of, preserving, korean, independence, as, the, crisis, mounted, in, a, series, of, reports, to, beijing, hu, weide, the, chinese, ambassador, in, saint, petersburg, from, july, 1902, to, september, 1907, looked, closely, at, whether, a, russian, or, a, japanese, victory, would, be, favourable, to, china, and, argued, that, the, latter, was, preferable, as, he, maintained, a, japanese, victory, presented, the, better, chance, for, china, to, regain, sovereignty, over, manchuria, in, december, 1903, china, decided, to, remain, neutral, if, war, came, because, though, japan, was, the, only, power, capable, of, evicting, russia, from, manchuria, the, extent, of, japanese, ambitions, in, manchuria, was, not, clear, to, beijing, russian, japanese, negotiations, then, followed, although, by, early, january, 1904, the, japanese, government, had, realised, that, russia, was, not, interested, in, settling, the, manchurian, or, korean, issues, instead, russia, s, goal, was, buying, time, via, diplomacy, to, further, build, up, militarily, in, december, 1903, wilhelm, wrote, in, a, marginal, note, on, a, diplomatic, dispatch, about, his, role, in, inflaming, russo, japanese, relations, since, 97, kiaochow, we, have, never, left, russia, in, any, doubt, that, we, would, cover, her, back, in, europe, in, case, she, decided, to, pursue, a, bigger, policy, in, the, far, east, that, might, lead, to, military, complications, with, the, aim, of, relieving, our, eastern, border, from, the, fearful, pressure, and, threat, of, the, massive, russian, army, whereupon, russia, took, port, arthur, and, trusting, us, took, her, fleet, out, of, the, baltic, thereby, making, herself, vulnerable, to, us, by, sea, in, danzig, 01, and, reval, 02, the, same, assurance, was, given, again, with, result, that, entire, russian, divisions, from, poland, and, european, russia, were, and, are, being, sent, to, the, far, east, this, would, not, had, happened, if, our, governments, had, not, been, in, agreement, a, recurring, theme, of, wilhelm, s, letters, to, nicholas, was, that, holy, russia, had, been, chosen, by, god, to, save, the, entire, white, race, from, the, yellow, peril, and, that, russia, was, entitled, to, annex, all, of, korea, manchuria, and, northern, china, up, to, beijing, wilhelm, went, on, to, assure, nicholas, that, once, russia, had, defeated, japan, this, would, be, a, deadly, blow, to, british, diplomacy, and, that, the, two, emperors, the, self, proclaimed, admiral, of, the, atlantic, and, the, admiral, of, the, pacific, would, rule, eurasia, together, making, them, able, to, challenge, british, sea, power, as, the, resources, of, eurasia, would, make, their, empires, immune, to, a, british, blockade, and, thus, allowing, germany, and, russia, to, divide, up, the, best, of, the, british, colonies, in, asia, between, them, nicholas, had, been, prepared, to, compromise, with, japan, but, after, receiving, a, letter, from, wilhelm, attacking, him, as, a, coward, for, his, willingness, to, compromise, with, the, japanese, who, wilhelm, never, ceasing, reminding, nicholas, represented, the, yellow, peril, for, the, sake, of, peace, became, more, obstinate, wilhelm, had, written, to, nicholas, stating, that, the, question, of, russian, interests, in, manchuria, and, korea, was, beside, the, point, saying, instead, it, was, a, matter, of, russia, undertaking, the, protection, and, defence, of, the, white, race, and, with, it, christian, civilization, against, the, yellow, race, and, whatever, the, japs, are, determined, to, ensure, the, domination, of, the, yellow, race, in, east, asia, to, put, themselves, at, its, head, and, organise, and, lead, it, into, battle, against, the, white, race, that, is, the, kernel, of, the, situation, and, therefore, there, can, be, very, little, doubt, about, where, the, sympathies, of, all, half, way, intelligent, europeans, should, lie, england, betrayed, europe, s, interests, to, america, in, a, cowardly, and, shameful, way, over, the, panama, canal, question, so, as, to, be, left, in, peace, by, the, yankees, will, the, tsar, likewise, betray, the, interests, of, the, white, race, to, the, yellow, as, to, be, left, in, peace, and, not, embarrass, the, hague, tribunal, too, much, when, nicholas, replied, that, he, still, wanted, peace, wilhelm, wrote, back, in, a, telegram, you, innocent, angel, telling, his, advisors, this, is, the, language, of, an, innocent, angel, but, not, that, of, a, white, tsar, nevertheless, tokyo, believed, that, russia, was, not, serious, about, seeking, a, peaceful, solution, to, the, dispute, on, 13, january, 1904, japan, proposed, a, formula, by, which, manchuria, would, remain, outside, japan, s, sphere, of, influence, and, reciprocally, korea, outside, russia, s, on, 21, december, 1903, the, katsura, cabinet, voted, to, go, to, war, against, russia, by, 4, february, 1904, no, formal, reply, had, been, received, from, saint, petersburg, on, 6, february, the, japanese, minister, to, russia, kurino, shin, ichir, was, recalled, and, japan, severed, diplomatic, relations, with, russia, potential, diplomatic, resolution, of, territorial, concerns, between, japan, and, russia, failed, historians, have, argued, that, this, directly, resulted, from, the, actions, of, emperor, nicholas, ii, crucially, nicholas, mismanaged, his, government, although, certain, scholars, contend, that, the, situation, arose, from, the, determination, of, nicholas, ii, to, use, the, war, against, japan, to, spark, a, revival, in, russian, patriotism, no, historical, evidence, supports, this, claim, the, tsar, s, advisors, did, not, support, the, war, foreseeing, problems, in, transporting, troops, and, supplies, from, european, russia, to, the, east, the, tsar, himself, repeatedly, delayed, negotiations, with, the, japanese, government, as, he, believed, that, he, was, protected, by, god, and, the, autocracy, the, japanese, understanding, of, this, can, be, seen, in, a, telegram, from, japanese, minister, of, foreign, affairs, komura, to, the, minister, to, russia, in, which, he, stated, the, japanese, government, have, at, all, times, during, the, progress, of, the, negotiations, made, it, a, special, point, to, give, prompt, answers, to, all, propositions, of, the, russian, government, the, negotiations, have, now, been, pending, for, no, less, than, four, months, and, they, have, not, yet, reached, a, stage, where, the, final, issue, can, with, certainty, be, predicted, in, these, circumstances, the, japanese, government, cannot, but, regard, with, grave, concern, the, situation, for, which, the, delays, in, negotiations, are, largely, responsible, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, nicholas, ii, dragged, japan, into, war, intentionally, in, hopes, of, reviving, russian, nationalism, this, notion, conflicts, with, a, comment, made, by, nicholas, to, kaiser, wilhelm, of, germany, saying, there, would, be, no, war, because, he, did, not, wish, it, this, does, not, reject, the, claim, that, russia, played, an, aggressive, role, in, the, east, which, it, did, rather, it, means, that, russia, unwisely, calculated, and, supposed, that, japan, would, not, go, to, war, against, russia, s, far, larger, and, seemingly, superior, navy, and, army, nicholas, held, the, japanese, in, contempt, as, yellow, monkeys, and, he, took, for, granted, that, the, japanese, would, simply, yield, in, the, face, of, russia, s, superior, power, which, thus, explains, his, unwillingness, to, compromise, evidence, of, russia, s, false, sense, of, security, and, superiority, to, japan, is, seen, by, russian, reference, to, japan, s, choosing, war, as, a, big, mistake, japan, had, conducted, detailed, studies, of, the, russian, far, east, and, manchuria, prior, to, the, war, and, as, it, was, mandatory, for, japanese, officers, to, speak, one, foreign, language, japan, had, access, to, superior, maps, during, the, conflict, the, japanese, army, relied, on, conscription, introduced, in, 1873, to, maintain, its, military, strength, and, to, provide, a, large, army, in, times, of, war, this, system, of, conscription, gave, japan, a, large, pool, of, reserves, to, draw, upon, the, active, and, 1st, line, reserve, the, 1st, line, reserve, was, used, to, bring, the, active, army, to, wartime, strength, totalled, 380, 000, the, 2nd, line, reserve, contained, 200, 000, the, conscript, reserve, a, further, 50, 000, and, the, kokumin, akin, to, a, national, guard, or, militia, 220, 000, this, amounted, to, 850, 000, trained, troops, available, for, service, in, addition, to, 4, 250, 000, men, in, the, untrained, reserve, immediately, available, to, japan, on, the, declaration, of, war, were, 257, 000, infantry, 11, 000, cavalry, and, 894, pieces, of, artillery, these, figures, were, divided, between, the, imperial, guards, division, 12, regular, divisions, 2, cavalry, brigades, 2, artillery, brigades, 13, reserve, brigades, depot, troops, and, the, garrison, of, taiwan, a, regular, japanese, division, contained, 11, 400, infantry, 430, cavalry, and, 36, guns, the, guns, being, organised, into, batteries, of, 6, though, another, 4, divisions, and, 4, reserve, brigades, were, formed, in, 1904, no, further, formations, were, created, as, the, reserves, were, used, to, replace, losses, sustained, in, combat, japanese, reserves, were, given, a, full, year, of, training, before, entering, combat, though, as, the, war, progressed, this, was, reduced, to, 6, months, due, to, high, casualties, the, japanese, army, did, not, follow, the, european, convention, of, implementing, corps, thus, there, were, no, corps, troops, or, command, and, the, japanese, divisions, were, immediately, subordinate, to, armies, olender, gives, a, different, appraisal, of, japanese, strength, maintaining, that, there, were, 350, 000, men, of, the, standing, army, and, 1st, reserve, with, an, additional, 850, 000, trained, men, in, reserve, creating, a, total, trained, force, of, 1, 200, 000, men, the, breakdown, of, the, japanese, standing, army, is, different, too, with, olender, giving, each, japanese, division, 19, 000, men, including, auxiliary, troops, he, also, states, that, the, 13, reserve, brigades, contained, 8, 000, men, each, and, mentions, 20, fortress, battalions, which, is, omitted, by, connaughton, it, is, further, stated, that, the, japanese, army, possessed, 1, 080, field, guns, and, between, 120, and, 150, heavy, guns, at, the, war, s, commencement, japanese, cavalry, was, not, considered, the, elite, of, the, army, as, was, the, case, in, russia, instead, japanese, cavalry, primarily, acted, as, scouts, and, fought, dismounted, armed, with, carbine, and, sword, this, was, reflected, in, the, fact, that, each, cavalry, brigade, contained, 6, machine, guns, there, is, no, consensus, over, how, many, russian, troops, were, present, in, the, far, east, around, the, time, of, the, commencement, of, the, war, one, estimate, states, that, the, russian, army, possessed, 60, 000, infantry, 3, 000, cavalry, and, 164, guns, mostly, at, vladivostok, and, port, arthur, with, a, portion, at, harbin, this, was, reinforced, by, the, middle, of, february, to, 95, 000, with, 45, 000, at, vladivostok, 8, 000, at, harbin, 9, 000, at, haicheng, 11, 000, on, the, yalu, river, and, 22, 000, at, port, arthur, olender, gives, the, figure, at, 100, 000, men, including, 8, infantry, divisions, fortress, troops, and, support, troops, the, entire, russian, army, in, 1904, amounted, to, 1, 200, 000, men, in, 29, corps, the, russian, plan, was, immensely, flawed, as, the, russians, possessed, only, 24, 000, potential, reinforcements, east, of, lake, baikal, when, the, war, commenced, they, would, be, reinforced, by, 35, 000, men, after, 4, months, and, a, further, 60, 000, men, 10, months, after, the, commencement, of, the, war, at, which, point, they, would, take, the, offensive, this, plan, was, based, on, the, erroneous, belief, that, the, japanese, army, could, only, mobilise, 400, 000, with, them, being, unable, to, field, more, than, 250, 000, in, an, operational, sense, and, 80, 000, 100, 000, of, their, operational, strength, being, necessary, to, secure, supply, lines, and, therefore, only, 150, 000, 170, 000, japanese, soldiers, would, be, available, for, field, action, the, possibility, of, port, arthur, being, taken, was, dismissed, entirely, an, alternative, figure, for, forces, in, the, far, east, is, given, at, over, 150, 000, men, and, 266, guns, with, vladivostok, and, port, arthur, containing, a, combined, force, of, 45, 000, men, and, with, an, additional, 55, 000, engaged, in, guarding, lines, of, communication, leaving, only, 50, 000, troops, to, take, the, field, unlike, the, japanese, the, russians, did, utilise, the, corps, system, and, in, fact, maintained, two, distinct, styles, of, corps, the, european, and, the, siberian, the, two, corps, both, possessed, two, divisions, and, their, corresponding, troop, numbers, but, a, siberian, division, was, much, smaller, containing, only, 3, 400, men, and, 20, guns, with, a, corps, containing, around, 12, 000, men, and, lacking, both, artillery, and, divisional, guns, russia, only, possessed, two, siberian, corps, both, unprepared, for, war, after, war, was, declared, this, number, was, raised, to, seven, as, the, conflict, progressed, the, european, corps, in, comparison, contained, 28, 000, soldiers, and, 112, guns, with, 6, such, corps, sent, to, the, far, east, during, the, war, a, further, three, being, dispatched, that, did, not, arrive, before, the, war, ended, russian, logistics, were, hampered, by, the, fact, that, the, only, connection, to, european, russia, was, the, trans, siberian, railway, which, remained, incomplete, as, at, lake, baikal, the, railway, was, not, connected, a, single, train, would, take, between, 15, and, 40, days, to, traverse, the, railway, with, 40, days, being, the, more, common, figure, a, single, battalion, would, take, a, month, to, transport, from, moscow, to, shenyang, after, the, line, s, eventual, completion, 20, trains, ran, daily, and, by, the, conclusion, of, the, war, some, 410, 000, soldiers, 93, 000, horses, and, 1, 000, guns, had, been, carried, down, it, the, tactics, utilised, by, the, russians, were, as, outdated, as, their, doctrine, the, russian, infantry, were, holding, to, the, maxim, of, suvorov, over, a, century, after, his, death, the, russian, command, still, used, strategies, from, the, crimean, war, attacking, en, echelon, across, a, wide, front, in, closed, formations, it, was, not, uncommon, for, russian, higher, command, to, bypass, their, intermediate, commanders, and, issue, orders, directly, to, battalions, thus, creating, confusion, during, combat, battleships, japan, issued, a, declaration, of, war, on, 8, february, 1904, however, three, hours, before, japan, s, declaration, of, war, was, received, by, the, russian, government, and, without, warning, the, imperial, japanese, navy, attacked, the, russian, far, east, fleet, at, port, arthur, tsar, nicholas, ii, was, stunned, by, news, of, the, attack, he, could, not, believe, that, japan, would, commit, an, act, of, war, without, a, formal, declaration, and, had, been, assured, by, his, ministers, that, the, japanese, would, not, fight, when, the, attack, came, according, to, cecil, spring, rice, first, secretary, at, the, british, embassy, it, left, the, tsar, almost, incredulous, russia, declared, war, on, japan, eight, days, later, japan, in, response, made, reference, to, the, russian, attack, on, sweden, in, 1808, without, declaration, of, war, although, the, requirement, to, mediate, disputes, between, states, before, commencing, hostilities, was, made, international, law, in, 1899, and, again, in, 1907, with, the, hague, conventions, of, 1899, and, 1907, the, principality, of, montenegro, also, declared, war, on, japan, in, gratitude, for, russia, s, political, support, of, the, montenegrin, prince, the, gesture, was, symbolic, and, no, soldiers, from, the, army, were, ever, deployed, in, the, far, east, but, a, few, montenegrins, volunteered, and, joined, the, russian, army, the, qing, empire, favoured, the, japanese, position, and, even, offered, military, aid, but, japan, declined, it, however, yuan, shikai, sent, envoys, to, japanese, generals, several, times, to, deliver, foodstuffs, and, alcoholic, drinks, native, manchurians, joined, the, war, on, both, sides, as, hired, troops, port, arthur, on, the, liaodong, peninsula, in, the, south, of, manchuria, had, been, fortified, into, a, major, naval, base, by, the, russian, imperial, army, since, it, needed, to, control, the, sea, in, order, to, fight, a, war, on, the, asian, mainland, japan, s, first, military, objective, was, to, neutralize, the, russian, fleet, at, port, arthur, on, the, night, of, 8, february, 1904, the, japanese, fleet, under, admiral, t, g, heihachir, opened, the, war, with, a, surprise, torpedo, boat, destroyer, attack, on, the, russian, ships, at, port, arthur, the, attack, heavily, damaged, the, tsesarevich, and, retvizan, the, heaviest, battleships, in, russia, s, far, eastern, theatre, and, the, 6, 600, ton, protected, cruiser, pallada, these, attacks, developed, into, the, battle, of, port, arthur, the, next, morning, a, series, of, indecisive, naval, engagements, followed, in, which, admiral, t, g, was, unable, to, attack, the, russian, fleet, successfully, as, it, was, protected, by, the, shore, batteries, of, the, harbour, and, the, russians, were, reluctant, to, leave, the, harbour, for, the, open, seas, especially, after, the, death, of, admiral, stepan, osipovich, makarov, from, a, naval, mine, on, 13, april, 1904, although, the, actual, battle, of, port, arthur, was, indecisive, the, initial, attacks, had, a, devastating, psychological, effect, on, russia, which, had, been, confident, about, the, prospect, of, war, the, japanese, had, seized, the, initiative, while, the, russians, waited, in, port, these, engagements, provided, cover, for, a, japanese, landing, near, incheon, in, korea, from, incheon, the, japanese, occupied, hanseong, and, then, the, rest, of, korea, after, the, japanese, occupation, of, hanseong, emperor, gojong, sent, a, detachment, of, 17, 000, soldiers, to, support, russia, by, the, end, of, april, the, japanese, imperial, army, under, kuroki, tamemoto, was, ready, to, cross, the, yalu, river, into, russian, occupied, manchuria, the, japanese, attempted, to, deny, the, russians, use, of, port, arthur, during, the, night, of, 13, 14, february, the, japanese, attempted, to, block, the, entrance, to, port, arthur, by, sinking, several, concrete, filled, steamers, in, the, deep, water, channel, to, the, port, but, they, sank, too, deep, to, be, effective, a, similar, attempt, to, block, the, harbour, entrance, during, the, night, of, 3, 4, may, also, failed, in, march, the, charismatic, vice, admiral, makarov, had, taken, command, of, the, first, russian, pacific, squadron, with, the, intention, of, breaking, out, of, the, port, arthur, blockade, on, 12, april, 1904, two, russian, pre, dreadnought, battleships, the, flagship, petropavlovsk, and, the, pobeda, slipped, out, of, port, but, struck, japanese, mines, off, port, arthur, the, petropavlovsk, sank, almost, immediately, while, the, pobeda, had, to, be, towed, back, to, port, for, extensive, repairs, on, 15, april, 1904, the, russian, government, made, overtures, threatening, to, seize, the, british, war, correspondents, who, were, taking, the, ship, ss, haimun, into, war, zones, to, report, for, the, london, based, times, newspaper, citing, concerns, about, the, possibility, of, the, british, giving, away, russian, positions, to, the, japanese, fleet, the, russians, quickly, learned, and, soon, employed, the, japanese, tactic, of, offensive, minelaying, on, 15, may, 1904, two, japanese, battleships, the, yashima, and, the, hatsuse, were, lured, into, a, recently, laid, russian, minefield, off, port, arthur, each, striking, at, least, two, mines, the, hatsuse, sank, within, minutes, taking, 450, sailors, with, her, while, the, yashima, sank, while, under, tow, towards, korea, for, repairs, on, 23, june, 1904, a, breakout, attempt, by, the, russian, squadron, now, under, the, command, of, admiral, wilgelm, vitgeft, failed, by, the, end, of, the, month, japanese, artillery, were, firing, shells, into, the, harbour, the, siege, of, port, arthur, commenced, in, april, 1904, japanese, troops, tried, numerous, frontal, assaults, on, the, fortified, hilltops, overlooking, the, harbour, which, were, defeated, with, japanese, casualties, in, the, thousands, with, the, aid, of, several, batteries, of, 11, inch, 280, mm, l, 10, howitzers, the, japanese, were, eventually, able, to, capture, the, key, hilltop, bastion, in, december, 1904, with, a, spotter, at, the, end, of, a, phone, line, located, at, this, vantage, point, the, long, range, artillery, was, able, to, shell, the, russian, fleet, which, was, unable, to, retaliate, against, the, land, based, artillery, invisible, over, the, other, side, of, hilltop, and, was, unable, or, unwilling, to, sail, out, against, the, blockading, fleet, four, russian, battleships, and, two, cruisers, were, sunk, in, succession, with, the, fifth, and, last, battleship, being, forced, to, scuttle, a, few, weeks, later, thus, all, capital, ships, of, the, russian, fleet, in, the, pacific, were, sunk, this, is, probably, the, only, example, in, military, history, when, such, a, scale, of, devastation, was, achieved, by, land, based, artillery, against, major, warships, meanwhile, attempts, to, relieve, the, besieged, city, by, land, also, failed, and, after, the, battle, of, liaoyang, in, late, august, the, northern, russian, force, that, might, have, been, able, to, relieve, port, arthur, retreated, to, mukden, shenyang, major, general, anatoly, stessel, commander, of, the, port, arthur, garrison, believed, that, the, purpose, of, defending, the, city, was, lost, after, the, fleet, had, been, destroyed, in, general, the, russian, defenders, were, suffering, disproportionate, casualties, each, time, the, japanese, attacked, in, particular, several, large, underground, mines, were, exploded, in, late, december, resulting, in, the, costly, capture, of, a, few, more, pieces, of, the, defensive, line, stessel, therefore, decided, to, surrender, to, the, surprised, japanese, generals, on, 2, january, 1905, he, made, his, decision, without, consulting, either, the, other, military, staff, present, or, the, tsar, and, military, command, all, of, whom, disagreed, with, the, decision, stessel, was, convicted, by, a, court, martial, in, 1908, and, sentenced, to, death, on, account, of, an, incompetent, defense, and, for, disobeying, orders, he, was, later, pardoned, even, before, the, war, british, and, japanese, intelligence, had, co, operated, against, russia, due, to, the, anglo, japanese, alliance, during, the, war, indian, army, stations, in, malaya, and, china, often, intercepted, and, read, wireless, and, telegraph, cable, traffic, relating, to, the, war, which, was, shared, with, the, japanese, in, their, turn, the, japanese, shared, information, about, russia, with, the, british, with, one, british, official, writing, of, the, perfect, quality, of, japanese, intelligence, in, particular, british, and, japanese, intelligence, gathered, much, evidence, that, germany, was, supporting, russia, in, the, war, as, part, of, a, bid, to, disturb, the, balance, of, power, in, europe, which, led, to, british, officials, increasingly, perceiving, germany, as, a, threat, to, the, international, order, in, contrast, to, the, japanese, strategy, of, rapidly, gaining, ground, to, control, manchuria, russian, strategy, focused, on, fighting, delaying, actions, to, gain, time, for, reinforcements, to, arrive, via, the, long, trans, siberian, railway, which, was, incomplete, near, irkutsk, at, the, time, on, 1, may, 1904, the, battle, of, yalu, river, became, the, first, major, land, battle, of, the, war, japanese, troops, stormed, a, russian, position, led, by, general, mikhail, zasulich, after, crossing, the, river, the, defeat, of, the, russian, eastern, detachment, removed, the, perception, that, the, japanese, would, be, an, easy, enemy, that, the, war, would, be, short, and, that, russia, would, be, the, overwhelming, victor, this, was, also, the, first, battle, in, decades, to, be, an, asian, victory, over, a, european, power, and, marked, russia, s, inability, to, match, japan, s, military, prowess, japanese, troops, proceeded, to, land, at, several, points, on, the, manchurian, coast, and, in, a, series, of, engagements, drove, the, russians, back, towards, port, arthur, the, subsequent, battles, including, the, battle, of, nanshan, on, 25, may, 1904, were, marked, by, heavy, japanese, losses, largely, from, attacking, entrenched, russian, positions, with, the, death, of, admiral, stepan, makarov, during, the, siege, of, port, arthur, in, april, 1904, admiral, wilgelm, vitgeft, was, appointed, commander, of, the, battle, fleet, and, was, ordered, to, make, a, sortie, from, port, arthur, and, deploy, his, force, to, vladivostok, flying, his, flag, in, the, french, built, pre, dreadnought, tsesarevich, vitgeft, proceeded, to, lead, his, six, battleships, four, cruisers, and, 14, torpedo, boat, destroyers, into, the, yellow, sea, in, the, early, morning, of, 10, august, 1904, waiting, for, him, was, admiral, t, g, and, his, fleet, of, four, battleships, 10, cruisers, and, 18, torpedo, boat, destroyers, at, approximately, 12, 15, the, battleship, fleets, obtained, visual, contact, with, each, other, and, at, 13, 00, with, t, g, crossing, vitgeft, s, t, they, commenced, main, battery, fire, at, a, range, of, about, eight, miles, the, longest, ever, conducted, up, to, that, time, for, about, thirty, minutes, the, battleships, pounded, one, another, until, they, had, closed, to, less, than, four, miles, and, began, to, bring, their, secondary, batteries, into, play, at, 18, 30, a, hit, from, one, of, t, g, s, battleships, struck, vitgeft, s, flagship, s, bridge, killing, him, instantly, with, the, tsesarevich, s, helm, jammed, and, their, admiral, killed, in, action, she, turned, from, her, battle, line, causing, confusion, among, her, fleet, however, t, g, was, determined, to, sink, the, russian, flagship, and, continued, pounding, her, and, it, was, saved, only, by, the, gallant, charge, of, the, american, built, russian, battleship, retvizan, whose, captain, successfully, drew, away, t, g, s, heavy, fire, from, the, russian, flagship, knowing, of, the, impending, battle, with, the, battleship, reinforcements, arriving, from, russia, the, baltic, fleet, t, g, chose, not, to, risk, his, battleships, by, pursuing, his, enemy, as, they, turned, about, and, headed, back, into, port, arthur, thus, ending, naval, history, s, longest, range, gunnery, duel, up, to, that, time, and, the, first, modern, clash, of, steel, battleship, fleets, on, the, high, seas, meanwhile, the, russians, were, preparing, to, reinforce, their, far, east, fleet, by, sending, the, baltic, fleet, under, the, command, of, admiral, zinovy, rozhestvensky, after, a, false, start, caused, by, engine, problems, and, other, mishaps, the, squadron, finally, departed, on, 15, october, 1904, and, sailed, halfway, around, the, world, from, the, baltic, sea, to, the, pacific, via, the, cape, route, around, the, cape, of, good, hope, in, the, course, of, a, seven, month, odyssey, that, was, to, attract, worldwide, attention, the, dogger, bank, incident, on, 21, october, 1904, where, the, russian, fleet, fired, on, british, fishing, boats, that, they, mistook, for, enemy, torpedo, boats, nearly, sparked, a, war, with, the, united, kingdom, an, ally, of, japan, but, neutral, unless, provoked, during, the, voyage, the, fleet, separated, into, a, portion, that, went, through, the, suez, canal, while, the, larger, battleships, went, around, the, cape, of, good, hope, during, the, fighting, in, manchuria, there, were, russian, troops, that, looted, and, burned, some, chinese, villages, raped, women, and, often, killed, those, who, resisted, or, did, not, understand, what, they, wanted, the, russian, justification, for, all, this, was, that, chinese, civilians, being, asian, must, have, been, helping, their, fellow, asians, the, japanese, inflict, defeat, on, the, russians, and, therefore, deserved, to, be, punished, the, russian, troops, were, gripped, by, the, fear, of, the, yellow, peril, and, saw, all, asians, not, just, the, japanese, as, the, enemy, all, of, the, russian, soldiers, were, much, feared, by, the, chinese, population, of, manchuria, but, it, was, the, cossacks, whom, they, feared, the, most, on, the, account, of, their, brutality, and, insatiable, desire, to, loot, largely, because, of, the, more, disciplined, behavior, of, the, japanese, the, han, and, manchu, population, of, manchuria, tended, to, be, pro, japanese, russian, soldiers, also, reportedly, raped, korean, women, for, example, in, the, city, of, chongju, the, japanese, were, also, prone, to, looting, albeit, in, a, considerably, less, brutal, manner, than, the, russians, and, summarily, executed, any, chinese, or, manchu, whom, they, suspected, of, being, spies, the, city, of, liaoyang, had, the, misfortune, to, be, sacked, three, times, within, three, days, first, by, the, russians, then, by, the, chinese, police, and, finally, by, the, japanese, the, japanese, hired, chinese, bandits, known, variously, as, the, honghuzi, hunghutze, or, khunkhuzy, to, engage, in, guerrilla, warfare, by, attacking, russian, supply, columns, only, once, did, the, honghuzi, attack, japanese, forces, and, that, attack, was, apparently, motivated, by, the, honghuzi, mistaking, the, japanese, forces, for, a, russian, one, zhang, zuolin, a, prominent, bandit, leader, and, the, future, old, marshal, who, would, rule, manchuria, as, a, warlord, between, 1916, and, 1928, worked, as, a, honghuzi, for, the, japanese, manchuria, was, still, officially, part, of, the, chinese, empire, and, the, chinese, civil, servants, tried, their, best, to, be, neutral, as, russian, and, japanese, troops, marched, across, manchuria, in, the, parts, of, manchuria, occupied, by, the, japanese, tokyo, appointed, civil, governors, who, worked, to, improve, health, sanitation, and, the, state, of, the, roads, these, activities, were, also, self, interested, as, improved, roads, lessened, japanese, logistics, problems, while, improved, health, amongst, the, chinese, lessened, the, dangers, of, diseases, infecting, the, japanese, troops, by, contrast, the, russians, made, no, effort, to, improve, sanitation, or, health, amongst, the, chinese, and, destroyed, everything, when, they, retreated, many, chinese, tended, to, see, the, japanese, as, the, lesser, evil, with, the, fall, of, port, arthur, the, japanese, 3rd, army, could, continue, northward, to, reinforce, positions, south, of, russian, held, mukden, with, the, onset, of, the, severe, manchurian, winter, there, had, been, no, major, land, engagements, since, the, battle, of, shaho, the, previous, year, the, two, sides, camped, opposite, each, other, along, 60, to, 70, miles, 110, km, of, front, lines, south, of, mukden, the, russian, second, army, under, general, oskar, gripenberg, between, 25, and, 29, january, attacked, the, japanese, left, flank, near, the, town, of, sandepu, almost, breaking, through, this, caught, the, japanese, by, surprise, however, without, support, from, other, russian, units, the, attack, stalled, gripenberg, was, ordered, to, halt, by, kuropatkin, and, the, battle, was, inconclusive, the, japanese, knew, that, they, needed, to, destroy, the, russian, army, in, manchuria, before, russian, reinforcements, arrived, via, the, trans, siberian, railroad, the, battle, of, mukden, commenced, on, 20, february, 1905, in, the, following, days, japanese, forces, proceeded, to, assault, the, right, and, left, flanks, of, russian, forces, surrounding, mukden, along, a, 50, mile, 80, km, front, approximately, half, a, million, men, were, involved, in, the, fighting, both, sides, were, well, entrenched, and, were, backed, by, hundreds, of, artillery, pieces, after, days, of, harsh, fighting, added, pressure, from, the, flanks, forced, both, ends, of, the, russian, defensive, line, to, curve, backwards, seeing, they, were, about, to, be, encircled, the, russians, began, a, general, retreat, fighting, a, series, of, fierce, rearguard, actions, which, soon, deteriorated, in, the, confusion, and, collapse, of, russian, forces, on, 10, march, 1905, after, three, weeks, of, fighting, general, kuropatkin, decided, to, withdraw, to, the, north, of, mukden, the, russians, suffered, an, estimated, 90, 000, casualties, in, the, battle, the, retreating, russian, manchurian, army, formations, disbanded, as, fighting, units, but, the, japanese, failed, to, destroy, them, completely, the, japanese, themselves, had, suffered, heavy, casualties, and, were, in, no, condition, to, pursue, although, the, battle, of, mukden, was, a, major, defeat, for, the, russians, and, was, the, most, decisive, land, battle, ever, fought, by, the, japanese, the, final, victory, still, depended, on, the, navy, after, a, stopover, of, several, weeks, at, the, minor, port, of, nossi, b, madagascar, that, had, been, reluctantly, allowed, by, neutral, france, in, order, not, to, jeopardize, its, relations, with, its, russian, ally, the, russian, baltic, fleet, proceeded, to, cam, ranh, bay, in, french, indochina, passing, on, its, way, through, the, singapore, strait, between, 7, and, 10, april, 1905, the, fleet, finally, reached, the, sea, of, japan, in, may, 1905, the, logistics, of, such, an, undertaking, in, the, age, of, coal, power, was, astounding, the, squadron, required, approximately, 500, 000, tons, of, coal, to, complete, the, journey, yet, by, international, law, it, was, not, allowed, to, coal, at, neutral, ports, forcing, the, russian, authorities, to, acquire, a, large, fleet, of, colliers, to, supply, the, fleet, at, sea, the, weight, of, the, ships, stores, needed, for, such, a, long, journey, was, to, be, another, major, problem, the, russian, second, pacific, squadron, the, renamed, baltic, fleet, sailed, 18, 000, nautical, miles, 33, 000, km, to, relieve, port, arthur, only, to, hear, the, demoralizing, news, that, port, arthur, had, fallen, while, it, was, still, at, madagascar, admiral, rozhestvensky, s, only, hope, now, was, to, reach, the, port, of, vladivostok, there, were, three, routes, to, vladivostok, with, the, shortest, and, most, direct, passing, through, tsushima, strait, between, korea, and, japan, however, this, was, also, the, most, dangerous, route, as, it, passed, between, the, japanese, home, islands, and, the, japanese, naval, bases, in, korea, admiral, t, g, was, aware, of, russian, progress, and, understood, that, with, the, fall, of, port, arthur, the, second, and, third, pacific, squadrons, would, try, to, reach, the, only, other, russian, port, in, the, far, east, vladivostok, battle, plans, were, laid, down, and, ships, were, repaired, and, refitted, to, intercept, the, russian, fleet, the, japanese, combined, fleet, which, had, originally, consisted, of, six, battleships, was, now, down, to, four, battleships, and, one, second, class, battleship, two, had, been, lost, to, mines, but, still, retained, its, cruisers, destroyers, and, torpedo, boats, the, russian, second, pacific, squadron, contained, eight, battleships, including, four, new, battleships, of, the, borodino, class, as, well, as, cruisers, destroyers, and, other, auxiliaries, for, a, total, of, 38, ships, by, the, end, of, may, the, second, pacific, squadron, was, on, the, last, leg, of, its, journey, to, vladivostok, taking, the, shorter, riskier, route, between, korea, and, japan, and, travelling, at, night, to, avoid, discovery, unfortunately, for, the, russians, while, in, compliance, with, the, rules, of, war, the, two, trailing, hospital, ships, had, continued, to, burn, their, lights, which, were, spotted, by, the, japanese, armed, merchant, cruiser, shinano, maru, wireless, communication, was, used, to, inform, togo, s, headquarters, where, the, combined, fleet, was, immediately, ordered, to, sortie, still, receiving, reports, from, scouting, forces, the, japanese, were, able, to, position, their, fleet, to, cross, the, t, of, the, russian, fleet, the, japanese, engaged, the, russians, in, the, tsushima, straits, on, 27, 28, may, 1905, the, russian, fleet, was, virtually, annihilated, losing, eight, battleships, numerous, smaller, vessels, and, more, than, 5, 000, men, while, the, japanese, lost, three, torpedo, boats, and, 116, men, only, three, russian, vessels, escaped, to, vladivostok, while, six, others, were, interned, in, neutral, ports, after, the, battle, of, tsushima, a, combined, japanese, army, and, navy, operation, commanded, by, admiral, kataoka, shichir, occupied, sakhalin, island, to, force, the, russians, into, suing, for, peace, military, leaders, and, senior, tsarist, officials, agreed, before, the, war, that, russia, was, a, much, stronger, nation, and, had, little, to, fear, from, the, empire, of, japan, the, fanatical, zeal, of, the, japanese, infantrymen, astonished, the, russians, who, were, dismayed, by, the, apathy, backwardness, and, defeatism, of, their, own, soldiers, the, defeats, of, the, army, and, navy, shook, russian, confidence, throughout, 1905, the, imperial, russian, government, was, rocked, by, revolution, the, population, was, against, escalation, of, the, war, the, empire, was, certainly, capable, of, sending, more, troops, but, this, would, make, little, difference, in, the, outcome, due, to, the, poor, state, of, the, economy, the, embarrassing, defeats, of, the, russian, army, and, navy, by, the, japanese, and, the, relative, unimportance, to, russia, of, the, disputed, land, which, made, the, war, extremely, unpopular, tsar, nicholas, ii, elected, to, negotiate, peace, so, he, could, concentrate, on, internal, matters, after, the, disaster, of, bloody, sunday, on, 9, january, 1905, both, sides, accepted, the, offer, of, united, states, president, theodore, roosevelt, to, mediate, meetings, were, held, in, portsmouth, new, hampshire, with, sergei, witte, leading, the, russian, delegation, and, baron, komura, leading, the, japanese, delegation, the, treaty, of, portsmouth, was, signed, on, 5, september, 1905, at, the, portsmouth, naval, shipyard, witte, became, russian, prime, minister, the, same, year, after, courting, the, japanese, roosevelt, decided, to, support, the, tsar, s, refusal, to, pay, indemnities, a, move, that, policymakers, in, tokyo, interpreted, as, signifying, that, the, united, states, had, more, than, a, passing, interest, in, asian, affairs, russia, recognized, korea, as, part, of, the, japanese, sphere, of, influence, and, agreed, to, evacuate, manchuria, japan, would, annex, korea, in, 1910, japan, korea, treaty, of, 1910, with, scant, protest, from, other, powers, from, 1910, until, the, end, of, its, occupation, of, korea, in, 1945, the, japanese, adopted, a, strategy, of, using, the, korean, peninsula, as, a, gateway, to, the, asian, continent, and, making, korea, s, economy, subordinate, to, japanese, economic, interests, russia, also, signed, over, its, 25, year, leasehold, rights, to, port, arthur, including, the, naval, base, and, the, peninsula, around, it, and, ceded, the, southern, half, of, sakhalin, island, to, japan, sakhalin, would, be, taken, back, by, the, soviet, union, following, the, defeat, of, the, japanese, in, world, war, ii, roosevelt, earned, the, nobel, peace, prize, for, his, effort, george, e, mowry, concludes, that, roosevelt, handled, the, arbitration, well, doing, an, excellent, job, of, balancing, russian, and, japanese, power, in, the, orient, where, the, supremacy, of, either, constituted, a, threat, to, growing, america, as, japan, had, won, every, battle, on, land, and, sea, and, as, the, japanese, people, did, not, understand, that, the, costs, of, the, war, had, pushed, their, nation, to, the, verge, of, bankruptcy, the, japanese, public, was, enraged, by, the, treaty, of, portsmouth, as, many, japanese, had, expected, the, war, to, end, with, russia, ceding, the, russian, far, east, to, japan, and, for, russia, to, pay, an, indemnity, the, united, states, was, widely, blamed, in, japan, for, the, treaty, of, portsmouth, with, roosevelt, having, allegedly, cheated, japan, out, of, its, rightful, claims, at, the, peace, conference, on, 5, september, 1905, the, hibiya, incendiary, incident, as, the, anti, american, riots, were, euphemistically, described, erupted, in, tokyo, and, lasted, for, three, days, forcing, the, government, to, declare, martial, law, the, treaty, of, portsmouth, overlooked, montenegro, s, participation, in, the, war, against, japan, leaving, the, two, countries, still, technically, belligerents, until, 2006, when, the, japanese, prime, minister, dispatched, the, vice, minister, of, foreign, affairs, akiko, yamanaka, with, a, personal, letter, from, him, for, the, prime, minister, of, montenegro, formally, ending, the, war, sources, do, not, agree, on, a, precise, number, of, deaths, from, the, war, because, of, a, lack, of, body, counts, for, confirmation, the, number, of, japanese, army, dead, in, combat, or, died, of, wounds, is, put, at, around, 59, 000, with, around, 27, 000, additional, casualties, from, disease, and, between, 6, 000, and, 12, 000, wounded, estimates, of, russian, army, dead, range, from, around, 34, 000, to, around, 53, 000, men, with, a, further, 9, 000, 19, 000, dying, of, disease, and, around, 75, 000, captured, the, total, number, of, dead, for, both, sides, is, generally, stated, as, around, 130, 000, to, 170, 000, after, the, siege, of, port, arthur, in, 1905, general, nogi, maresuke, who, led, the, japanese, army, during, the, siege, felt, so, guilty, about, the, loss, of, many, japanese, soldiers, that, he, wanted, to, commit, ritual, suicide, but, the, japanese, emperor, meiji, refused, to, allow, it, instead, maresuke, mentored, the, future, emperor, hirohito, and, built, hospitals, after, emperor, meiji, died, in, 1912, maresuke, and, his, wife, committed, suicide, 7, years, after, the, siege, of, port, arthur, this, was, the, first, major, military, victory, in, the, modern, era, of, an, asian, power, over, a, european, nation, russia, s, defeat, was, met, with, shock, in, the, west, and, across, the, far, east, japan, s, prestige, rose, greatly, as, it, came, to, be, seen, as, a, modern, nation, concurrently, russia, lost, virtually, its, entire, pacific, and, baltic, fleets, and, also, much, international, esteem, this, was, particularly, true, in, the, eyes, of, germany, and, austria, hungary, before, world, war, i, russia, was, france, s, and, serbia, s, ally, its, loss, of, prestige, emboldened, germany, in, planning, for, war, with, france, and, supporting, austria, hungary, s, war, with, serbia, the, defeat, of, 1905, led, in, the, short, term, to, russian, military, reforms, that, allowed, it, to, face, germany, in, world, war, i, though, there, had, been, popular, support, for, the, war, among, the, russian, public, following, the, japanese, attack, at, port, arthur, in, 1904, that, popular, support, soon, turned, to, discontent, after, suffering, multiple, defeats, at, the, hands, of, the, japanese, forces, for, many, russians, the, immediate, shock, of, unexpected, humiliation, at, the, hands, of, japan, caused, the, conflict, to, be, viewed, as, a, metaphor, for, the, shortcomings, of, the, romanov, autocracy, this, discontent, added, fuel, to, the, simmering, russian, revolution, of, 1905, an, event, nicholas, ii, had, hoped, to, avoid, by, taking, intransigent, negotiating, stances, to, quell, the, uprising, nicholas, ii, issued, the, october, manifesto, which, included, only, limited, reforms, such, as, the, duma, and, failed, to, address, the, societal, problems, of, russia, at, the, time, twelve, years, later, that, discontent, would, boil, over, into, the, february, revolution, of, 1917, in, poland, which, russia, partitioned, in, the, late, 18th, century, and, where, russian, rule, already, caused, two, major, uprisings, the, population, was, so, restless, that, an, army, of, 250, 000, 300, 000, larger, than, the, one, facing, the, japanese, had, to, be, stationed, to, put, down, the, unrest, russia, had, mobilized, thousands, of, polish, reservists, during, the, war, with, japan, contributing, to, unrest, contemporary, reports, found, that, some, poles, preferred, death, over, fighting, the, japanese, for, russia, some, political, leaders, of, the, polish, insurrection, movement, in, particular, j, zef, pi, sudski, sent, emissaries, to, japan, to, collaborate, on, sabotage, and, intelligence, gathering, within, the, russian, empire, and, even, plan, a, japanese, aided, uprising, japan, had, become, the, rising, asian, power, and, had, proven, that, its, military, could, fight, the, major, powers, in, europe, with, success, most, western, powers, were, stunned, that, the, japanese, not, only, prevailed, but, decisively, defeated, russia, in, the, russo, japanese, war, japan, had, also, portrayed, a, sense, of, readiness, in, taking, a, more, active, and, leading, role, in, asian, affairs, which, in, turn, had, led, to, widespread, nationalism, throughout, the, region, although, the, war, had, ended, in, a, victory, for, japan, japanese, public, opinion, was, shocked, by, the, very, restrained, peace, terms, which, were, negotiated, at, the, war, s, end, widespread, discontent, spread, through, the, populace, upon, the, announcement, of, the, treaty, terms, causing, the, hibiya, incendiary, incident, riots, erupted, in, major, cities, in, japan, following, the, incident, including, demonstrations, in, front, of, the, us, legation, in, tokyo, two, specific, requirements, expected, after, such, a, costly, victory, were, especially, lacking, territorial, gains, and, monetary, reparations, to, japan, the, peace, accord, led, to, feelings, of, distrust, as, the, japanese, had, intended, to, retain, all, of, sakhalin, island, but, were, forced, to, settle, for, half, of, it, after, being, pressured, by, the, united, states, with, president, roosevelt, opting, to, support, nicholas, ii, s, stance, on, not, ceding, territory, or, paying, reparations, the, japanese, had, wanted, reparations, to, help, families, recover, from, lost, fathers, and, sons, as, well, as, heavy, taxation, by, the, government, to, finance, the, war, without, them, they, were, at, a, loss, the, outcome, of, the, portsmouth, peace, negotiations, mediated, by, the, u, s, was, received, by, the, general, japanese, population, with, disbelief, on, september, 5, and, 6, when, all, the, major, newspapers, reported, the, content, of, the, signed, treaty, in, lengthy, editorials, as, a, result, the, wartime, government, the, first, katsura, cabinet, which, remained, in, power, for, the, longest, period, 1, 681, days, in, the, history, of, japanese, democracy, to, date, declared, martial, law, to, suppress, the, riots, on, september, 6, one, day, after, the, signing, in, portsmouth, martial, law, was, lifted, on, november, 29, after, more, than, 2, 000, people, were, arrested, but, the, cabinet, resigned, on, december, 22, after, ratifying, the, treaty, on, october, 10, as, if, taking, the, responsibility, for, a, lost, war, the, russo, japanese, war, introduced, a, number, of, characteristics, that, came, to, define, 20th, century, politics, and, warfare, many, of, the, innovations, brought, by, the, industrial, revolution, such, as, rapid, firing, artillery, and, machine, guns, as, well, as, more, accurate, rifles, were, first, tested, on, a, mass, scale, military, operations, on, both, sea, and, land, showed, that, modern, warfare, had, undergone, a, considerable, change, since, the, franco, prussian, war, of, 1870, 71, most, army, commanders, had, previously, envisioned, using, these, weapon, systems, to, dominate, the, battlefield, on, an, operational, and, tactical, level, but, as, events, played, out, the, technological, advances, forever, altered, the, conditions, of, war, too, for, east, asia, this, was, the, first, confrontation, in, thirty, years, involving, two, modern, armed, forces, the, advanced, weaponry, led, to, massive, casualties, neither, japan, nor, russia, had, prepared, for, the, number, of, deaths, that, would, occur, in, this, new, kind, of, warfare, and, neither, had, the, resources, to, compensate, for, such, losses, this, also, left, its, impression, on, society, at, large, with, the, emergence, of, transnational, and, nongovernmental, organizations, like, the, red, cross, becoming, prominent, after, the, war, the, consequent, identification, of, common, problems, and, challenges, began, the, slow, process, that, came, to, dominate, much, of, the, 20th, century, it, has, also, been, argued, that, the, conflict, had, characteristics, of, what, was, later, to, be, described, as, total, war, these, included, the, mass, mobilization, of, troops, into, battle, and, the, need, for, so, extensive, a, supply, of, equipment, armaments, and, supplies, that, both, domestic, support, and, foreign, aid, were, required, it, is, also, argued, that, domestic, response, in, russia, to, the, inefficiencies, of, the, tsarist, government, set, in, motion, the, eventual, dissolution, of, the, romanov, dynasty, to, the, western, powers, japan, s, victory, demonstrated, the, emergence, of, a, new, asian, regional, power, with, the, russian, defeat, some, scholars, have, argued, that, the, war, had, set, in, motion, a, change, in, the, global, world, order, with, the, emergence, of, japan, as, not, only, a, regional, power, but, rather, the, main, asian, power, rather, more, than, the, possibilities, of, diplomatic, partnership, were, emerging, however, the, us, and, australian, reaction, to, the, changed, balance, of, power, brought, by, the, war, was, mixed, with, fears, of, a, yellow, peril, eventually, shifting, from, china, to, japan, american, figures, such, as, w, e, b, du, bois, and, lothrop, stoddard, saw, the, victory, as, a, challenge, to, western, supremacy, this, was, reflected, in, austria, where, baron, christian, von, ehrenfels, interpreted, the, challenge, in, racial, as, well, as, cultural, terms, arguing, that, the, absolute, necessity, of, a, radical, sexual, reform, for, the, continued, existence, of, the, western, races, of, men, has, been, raised, from, the, level, of, discussion, to, the, level, of, a, scientifically, proven, fact, to, stop, the, japanese, yellow, peril, would, require, drastic, changes, to, society, and, sexuality, in, the, west, certainly, the, japanese, success, increased, self, confidence, among, anti, colonial, nationalists, in, colonised, asian, countries, vietnamese, indonesians, indians, and, filipinos, and, to, those, in, declining, countries, like, the, ottoman, empire, and, persia, in, immediate, danger, of, being, absorbed, by, the, western, powers, it, also, encouraged, the, chinese, who, despite, having, been, at, war, with, the, japanese, only, a, decade, before, still, considered, westerners, the, greater, threat, as, sun, yat, sen, commented, we, regarded, that, russian, defeat, by, japan, as, the, defeat, of, the, west, by, the, east, we, regarded, the, japanese, victory, as, our, own, victory, even, in, far, off, tibet, the, war, was, a, subject, of, conversation, when, sven, hedin, visited, the, panchen, lama, in, february, 1907, while, for, jawaharlal, nehru, then, only, an, aspiring, politician, in, british, india, japan, s, victory, lessened, the, feeling, of, inferiority, from, which, most, of, us, suffered, a, great, european, power, had, been, defeated, thus, asia, could, still, defeat, europe, as, it, had, done, in, the, past, and, in, the, ottoman, empire, too, the, committee, of, union, and, progress, embraced, japan, as, a, role, model, in, europe, subject, populations, were, similarly, encouraged, james, joyce, s, novel, ulysses, set, in, dublin, in, 1904, contains, hopeful, irish, allusions, as, to, the, outcome, of, the, war, and, in, partitioned, poland, the, artist, j, zef, mehoffer, chose, 1905, to, paint, his, europa, jubilans, europe, rejoicing, which, portrays, an, aproned, maid, taking, her, ease, on, a, sofa, against, a, background, of, eastern, artefacts, painted, following, demonstrations, against, the, war, and, russian, cultural, suppression, and, in, the, year, of, russia, s, defeat, its, subtly, coded, message, looks, forward, to, a, time, when, the, tsarist, masters, will, be, defeated, in, europe, as, they, had, been, in, asia, the, significance, of, the, war, was, clear, too, for, socialist, thinkers, the, russo, japanese, war, now, gives, to, all, an, awareness, that, even, war, and, peace, in, europe, its, destiny, is, not, decided, between, the, four, walls, of, the, european, concert, but, outside, it, in, the, gigantic, maelstrom, of, world, and, colonial, politics, and, it, s, in, this, that, the, real, meaning, of, the, current, war, resides, for, social, democracy, even, if, we, set, aside, its, immediate, effect, the, collapse, of, russian, absolutism, this, war, brings, the, gaze, of, the, international, proletariat, back, to, the, great, political, and, economic, connectedness, of, the, world, and, violently, dissipates, in, our, ranks, the, particularism, the, pettiness, of, ideas, that, form, in, any, period, of, political, calm, russia, had, lost, two, of, its, three, fleets, only, its, black, sea, fleet, remained, the, result, of, the, 1878, treaty, of, berlin, which, had, prevented, the, fleet, from, leaving, the, black, sea, through, the, bosphorus, since, turkey, and, britain, would, not, waive, the, relevant, clauses, the, berlin, treaty, superseded, the, london, straits, convention, of, 1841, which, had, been, favourable, to, russia, japan, became, the, sixth, most, powerful, naval, force, by, combined, tonnage, while, the, russian, navy, declined, to, one, barely, stronger, than, that, of, austria, hungary, the, actual, costs, of, the, war, were, large, enough, to, affect, the, russian, economy, and, despite, grain, exports, the, nation, developed, an, external, balance, of, payments, deficit, the, cost, of, military, re, equipment, and, re, expansion, after, 1905, pushed, the, economy, further, into, deficit, although, the, size, of, the, deficit, was, obscured, the, japanese, were, on, the, offensive, for, most, of, the, war, and, used, massed, infantry, assaults, against, defensive, positions, which, would, later, become, the, standard, of, all, european, armies, during, world, war, i, the, battles, of, the, russo, japanese, war, in, which, machine, guns, and, artillery, took, a, heavy, toll, on, russian, and, japanese, troops, were, a, precursor, to, the, trench, warfare, of, world, war, i, a, german, military, advisor, sent, to, japan, jakob, meckel, had, a, tremendous, impact, on, the, development, of, the, japanese, military, training, tactics, strategy, and, organization, his, reforms, were, credited, with, japan, s, overwhelming, victory, over, china, in, the, first, sino, japanese, war, of, 1894, 1895, however, his, over, reliance, on, infantry, in, offensive, campaigns, also, led, to, a, large, number, of, japanese, casualties, military, and, economic, exhaustion, affected, both, countries, japanese, historians, regard, this, war, as, a, turning, point, for, japan, and, a, key, to, understanding, the, reasons, why, japan, may, have, failed, militarily, and, politically, later, after, the, war, acrimony, was, felt, at, every, level, of, japanese, society, and, it, became, the, consensus, within, japan, that, their, nation, had, been, treated, as, the, defeated, power, during, the, peace, conference, as, time, went, on, this, feeling, coupled, with, the, sense, of, arrogance, at, becoming, a, great, power, grew, and, added, to, growing, japanese, hostility, towards, the, west, and, fuelled, japan, s, military, and, imperial, ambitions, furthermore, japan, s, substantiated, interests, in, korea, and, liaodong, led, to, the, creation, of, a, kwantung, army, which, became, an, autonomous, and, increasingly, powerful, regional, force, only, five, years, after, the, war, japan, de, jure, annexed, korea, as, part, of, its, colonial, empire, two, decades, after, that, the, kwantung, army, staged, an, incident, that, led, to, the, invasion, of, manchuria, in, the, mukden, incident, the, kwantung, army, eventually, came, to, be, heavily, involved, in, the, state, s, politics, and, administration, leading, to, a, series, of, localized, conflicts, with, chinese, regional, warlords, that, finally, extended, into, the, second, sino, japanese, war, in, 1937, as, a, result, most, chinese, historians, consider, the, russo, japanese, war, as, a, key, development, in, japan, s, spiral, into, militarism, in, the, 1920s, 30s, following, the, victory, of, the, battle, of, tsushima, japan, s, erstwhile, british, ally, presented, a, lock, of, admiral, nelson, s, hair, to, the, imperial, japanese, navy, judging, its, performance, then, as, on, a, par, with, britain, s, victory, at, trafalgar, in, 1805, it, is, still, on, display, at, kyouiku, sankoukan, a, public, museum, maintained, by, the, japan, self, defence, force, nevertheless, there, was, a, consequent, shift, in, british, strategic, thinking, resulting, in, enlargement, of, its, naval, docks, at, auckland, new, zealand, bombay, british, india, fremantle, and, sydney, australia, simon, s, town, cape, colony, singapore, and, british, hong, kong, the, naval, war, confirmed, the, direction, of, the, british, admiralty, s, thinking, in, tactical, terms, even, as, it, undermined, its, strategic, grasp, of, a, changing, world, tactical, orthodoxy, for, example, assumed, that, a, naval, battle, would, imitate, the, conditions, of, stationary, combat, and, that, ships, would, engage, in, one, long, line, sailing, on, parallel, courses, but, more, flexible, tactical, thinking, would, now, be, required, as, a, firing, ship, and, its, target, manoeuvred, independently, military, and, civilian, observers, from, every, major, power, closely, followed, the, course, of, the, war, most, were, able, to, report, on, events, from, the, perspective, of, embedded, positions, within, the, land, and, naval, forces, of, both, russia, and, japan, these, military, attach, s, and, other, observers, prepared, first, hand, accounts, of, the, war, and, analytical, papers, in, depth, observer, narratives, of, the, war, and, more, narrowly, focused, professional, journal, articles, were, written, soon, after, the, war, these, post, war, reports, conclusively, illustrated, the, battlefield, destructiveness, of, this, conflict, this, was, the, first, time, the, tactics, of, entrenched, positions, for, infantry, defended, with, machine, guns, and, artillery, became, vitally, important, both, would, become, dominant, factors, in, world, war, i, even, though, entrenched, positions, had, already, been, a, significant, part, of, both, the, franco, prussian, war, and, the, american, civil, war, it, is, now, apparent, that, the, high, casualty, counts, and, the, tactical, lessons, readily, available, to, observer, nations, were, completely, disregarded, in, preparations, for, war, in, europe, and, during, much, of, the, course, of, world, war, i, in, 1904, 1905, ian, standish, monteith, hamilton, was, the, military, attach, of, the, british, indian, army, serving, with, the, imperial, japanese, army, in, manchuria, as, one, of, the, several, military, attach, s, from, western, countries, he, was, the, first, to, arrive, in, japan, after, the, start, of, the, war, he, therefore, would, be, recognized, as, the, dean, of, multi, national, attach, s, and, observers, in, this, conflict, although, out, ranked, by, british, field, marshal, william, gustavus, nicholson, 1st, baron, nicholson, who, was, later, to, become, chief, of, the, imperial, general, staff, despite, its, gold, reserves, of, 106, 3, million, pounds, russia, s, pre, war, financial, situation, was, not, enviable, the, country, had, large, budget, deficits, year, after, year, and, was, largely, dependent, on, borrowed, money, russia, s, war, effort, was, funded, primarily, by, france, in, a, series, of, loans, totalling, 800, million, francs, 30, 4, million, another, loan, in, the, amount, of, 600, million, francs, was, agreed, upon, but, later, cancelled, these, loans, were, extended, within, a, climate, of, mass, bribing, of, the, french, press, made, necessary, by, russia, s, precarious, economic, and, social, situation, and, poor, military, performance, although, initially, reluctant, to, participate, in, the, war, the, french, government, and, major, banks, were, co, operative, since, it, became, clear, that, russian, and, french, economic, interests, were, tied, in, addition, to, french, money, russia, secured, a, loan, in, the, amount, of, 500, million, marks, 24, 5, million, from, germany, who, also, financed, japan, s, war, effort, japan, s, pre, war, gold, reserves, were, a, modest, 11, 7, million, a, major, portion, of, the, total, cost, of, the, war, was, covered, by, money, borrowed, from, the, united,

into, lithographs, and, other, reproducible, forms, propaganda, images, were, circulated, by, both, sides, often, in, the, form, of, postcards, and, based, on, insulting, racial, stereotypes, these, were, produced, not, only, by, the, combatants, but, by, those, from, european, countries, who, supported, one, or, the, other, side, or, had, a, commercial, or, colonial, stake, in, the, area, war,

these, had, been, common, during, the, sino, japanese, war, a, decade, earlier, and, celebrations, of, the, new, conflict, tended, to, repeat, the, same, imagery, and, situations, but, by, this, time, in, japan, postcards, had, become, the, most, common, form, of, communication, and, they, soon, replaced, prints, as, a, medium, for, topographical, imagery, and, war, reportage, in, some, ways, however, they, were, still, dependent, on, the, print, for, their, pictorial, conventions, not, least, in, issuing, the, cards, in, series, that, assembled, into, a, composite, scene, or, design, either, as, diptychs, triptychs, or, even, more, ambitious, formats, however, captioning, swiftly, moved, from, the, calligraphic, side, inscription, to, a, printed, title, below, and, not, just, in, japanese, but, in, english, and, other, european, languages, there, was, a, lively, sense, that, these, images, served, not, only, as, mementoes, but, also, as, propaganda, statements, war, artists,

true, target, and, immediately, banned, it, from, performance, the, opera, was, premiered, in, 1909, after, rimsky, korsakov, s, death, and, even, then, with, modifications, required, by, the,
