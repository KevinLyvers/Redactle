https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age
the, little, ice, age, lia, was, a, period, of, regional, cooling, particularly, pronounced, in, the, north, atlantic, region, it, was, not, a, true, ice, age, of, global, extent, the, term, was, introduced, into, scientific, literature, by, fran, ois, e, matthes, in, 1939, the, period, has, been, conventionally, defined, as, extending, from, the, 16th, to, the, 19th, centuries, but, some, experts, prefer, an, alternative, time, span, from, about, 1300, to, about, 1850, the, nasa, earth, observatory, notes, three, particularly, cold, intervals, one, began, about, 1650, another, about, 1770, and, the, last, in, 1850, all, of, which, were, separated, by, intervals, of, slight, warming, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, third, assessment, report, considered, that, the, timing, and, the, areas, affected, by, the, lia, suggested, largely, independent, regional, climate, changes, rather, than, a, globally, synchronous, increased, glaciation, at, most, there, was, modest, cooling, of, the, northern, hemisphere, during, the, period, several, causes, have, been, proposed, cyclical, lows, in, solar, radiation, heightened, volcanic, activity, changes, in, the, ocean, circulation, variations, in, earth, s, orbit, and, axial, tilt, orbital, forcing, inherent, variability, in, global, climate, and, decreases, in, the, human, population, such, as, from, the, massacres, by, genghis, khan, the, black, death, and, the, epidemics, emerging, in, the, americas, upon, european, contact, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, third, assessment, report, tar, of, 2001, described, the, areas, that, were, affected, evidence, from, mountain, glaciers, does, suggest, increased, glaciation, in, a, number, of, widely, spread, regions, outside, europe, prior, to, the, twentieth, century, including, alaska, new, zealand, and, patagonia, however, the, timing, of, maximum, glacial, advances, in, these, regions, differs, considerably, suggesting, that, they, may, represent, largely, independent, regional, climate, changes, not, a, globally, synchronous, increased, glaciation, thus, current, evidence, does, not, support, globally, synchronous, periods, of, anomalous, cold, or, warmth, over, this, interval, and, the, conventional, terms, of, little, ice, age, and, medieval, warm, period, appear, to, have, limited, utility, in, describing, trends, in, hemispheric, or, global, mean, temperature, changes, in, past, centuries, hemispherically, the, little, ice, age, can, only, be, considered, as, a, modest, cooling, of, the, northern, hemisphere, during, this, period, of, less, than, 1, c, relative, to, late, twentieth, century, levels, the, ipcc, fourth, assessment, report, ar4, of, 2007, discusses, more, recent, research, and, gives, particular, attention, to, the, medieval, warm, period, when, viewed, together, the, currently, available, reconstructions, indicate, generally, greater, variability, in, centennial, time, scale, trends, over, the, last, 1, kyr, than, was, apparent, in, the, tar, the, result, is, a, picture, of, relatively, cool, conditions, in, the, seventeenth, and, early, nineteenth, centuries, and, warmth, in, the, eleventh, and, early, fifteenth, centuries, but, the, warmest, conditions, are, apparent, in, the, twentieth, century, given, that, the, confidence, levels, surrounding, all, of, the, reconstructions, are, wide, virtually, all, reconstructions, are, effectively, encompassed, within, the, uncertainty, previously, indicated, in, the, tar, the, major, differences, between, the, various, proxy, reconstructions, relate, to, the, magnitude, of, past, cool, excursions, principally, during, the, twelfth, to, fourteenth, seventeenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, there, is, no, consensus, on, when, the, little, ice, age, began, but, a, series, of, events, before, the, known, climatic, minima, have, often, been, referenced, in, the, 13th, century, pack, ice, began, advancing, southwards, in, the, north, atlantic, as, did, glaciers, in, greenland, anecdotal, evidence, suggests, expanding, glaciers, almost, worldwide, based, on, radiocarbon, dating, of, roughly, 150, samples, of, dead, plant, material, with, roots, intact, that, were, collected, from, beneath, ice, caps, on, baffin, island, and, iceland, miller, et, al, 2012, state, that, cold, summers, and, ice, growth, began, abruptly, between, 1275, and, 1300, followed, by, a, substantial, intensification, from, 1430, to, 1455, in, contrast, a, climate, reconstruction, based, on, glacial, length, shows, no, great, variation, from, 1600, to, 1850, but, a, strong, retreat, thereafter, therefore, any, of, several, dates, ranging, over, 400, years, may, indicate, the, beginning, of, the, little, ice, age, the, little, ice, age, ended, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, or, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, 6th, report, of, the, ipcc, describes, the, coldest, period, in, the, last, millennium, as, a, multi, centennial, period, of, relatively, low, temperature, beginning, around, the, 15th, century, with, gmst, averaging, 0, 03, c, between, 1450, and, 1850, relative, to, 1850, 1900, drangaj, kull, iceland, s, northernmost, glacier, reached, its, maximum, extent, during, the, lia, around, 1400, ce, the, baltic, sea, froze, over, twice, in,

the, following, decades, the, remaining, europeans, left, in, what, seems, to, have, been, a, gradual, withdrawal, which, was, caused, mainly, by, economic, factors, such, as, increased, availability, of, farms, in, scandinavian, countries, greenland, was, largely, cut, off, by, ice, from, 1410, to, the, 1720s, between, 1620, and, 1740, the, yzeron, basin, in, the, massif, central, of, france, witnessed, a, phase, of, decreased, fluvial, activity, this, decline, in, fluvial, activity, is, believed, to, be, linked, to, a, multidecennial, phase, of, droughts, in, the, western, mediterranean, in, southwestern, europe, a, negative, north, atlantic, oscillation, nao, combined, with, increased, aridity, caused, an, increase, in, wind, driven, sediment, deposition, during, the, lia, in, his, 1995, book, the, early, climatologist, hubert, lamb, said, that, in, many, years, snowfall, was, much, heavier, than, recorded, before, or, since, and, the, snow, lay, on, the, ground, for, many, months, longer, than, it, does, today, in, lisbon, portugal, snowstorms, were, much, more, frequent, than, today, and, one, winter, in, the, 17th, century, produced, eight, snowstorms, many, springs, and, summers, were, cold, and, wet, but, with, great, variability, between, years, and, groups, of, years, that, was, particularly, evident, during, the, grindelwald, fluctuation, 1560, 1630, the, rapid, cooling, phase, was, associated, with, more, erratic, weather, including, increased, storminess, unseasonal, snowstorms, and, droughts, crop, practices, throughout, europe, had, to, be, altered, to, adapt, to, the, shortened, and, less, reliable, growing, season, and, there, were, many, years, of, scarcity, and, famine, one, was, the, great, famine, of, 1315, 1317, but, that, may, have, been, before, the, little, ice, age, according, to, elizabeth, ewan, and, janay, nugent, famines, in, france, 1693, 94, norway, 1695, 96, and, sweden, 1696, 97, claimed, roughly, 10, percent, of, the, population, of, each, country, in, estonia, and, finland, in, 1696, 97, losses, have, been, estimated, at, a, fifth, and, a, third, of, the, national, populations, respectively, viticulture, disappeared, from, some, northern, regions, and, storms, caused, serious, flooding, and, loss, of, life, some, of, them, resulted, in, the, permanent, loss, of, large, areas, of, land, from, the, danish, german, and, dutch, coasts, the, violinmaker, antonio, stradivari, produced, his, instruments, during, the, little, ice, age, the, colder, climate, may, have, caused, the, wood, that, was, used, in, his, violins, to, be, denser, than, in, warmer, periods, and, to, contribute, to, the, tone, of, his, instruments, according, to, the, science, historian, james, burke, the, period, inspired, such, novelties, in, everyday, life, as, the, widespread, use, of, buttons, and, button, holes, as, well, as, knitting, of, custom, made, undergarments, for, the, better, covering, and, insulating, of, the, body, chimneys, were, invented, to, replace, open, fires, in, the, centre, of, communal, halls, to, allow, houses, with, multiple, rooms, to, have, the, separation, of, masters, from, servants, the, little, ice, age, by, the, anthropologist, brian, fagan, of, the, university, of, california, at, santa, barbara, describes, the, plight, of, european, peasants, from, 1300, to, 1850, famines, hypothermia, bread, riots, and, the, rise, of, despotic, leaders, brutalizing, an, increasingly, dispirited, peasantry, in, the, late, 17th, century, agriculture, had, dropped, off, dramatically, alpine, villagers, lived, on, bread, made, from, ground, nutshells, mixed, with, barley, and, oat, flour, historian, wolfgang, behringer, has, linked, intensive, witch, hunting, episodes, in, europe, to, agricultural, failures, during, the, little, ice, age, the, frigid, golden, age, by, the, environmental, historian, dagomar, degroot, of, georgetown, university, points, out, that, some, societies, thrived, but, others, faltered, during, the, little, ice, age, in, particular, the, little, ice, age, transformed, environments, around, the, dutch, republic, and, made, them, easier, to, exploit, in, commerce, and, conflict, the, dutch, were, resilient, even, adaptive, in, the, face, of, weather, that, devastated, neighboring, countries, merchants, exploited, harvest, failures, military, commanders, took, advantage, of, shifting, wind, patterns, and, inventors, developed, technologies, that, helped, them, profit, from, the, cold, the, 17th, century, dutch, golden, age, therefore, owed, much, to, its, people, s, flexibility, in, coping, with, the, changing, climate, historians, have, argued, that, cultural, responses, to, the, consequences, of, the, little, ice, age, in, europe, consisted, of, violent, scapegoating, the, prolonged, cold, dry, periods, brought, drought, upon, many, european, communities, and, resulted, in, poor, crop, growth, poor, livestock, survival, and, increased, activity, of, pathogens, and, disease, vectors, disease, intensified, under, the, same, conditions, that, unemployment, and, economic, difficulties, arose, prolonged, cold, dry, seasons, disease, and, unemployment, generated, a, lethal, positive, feedback, loop, although, the, communities, had, some, contingency, plans, such, as, better, crop, mixes, emergency, grain, stocks, and, international, food, trade, they, did, not, always, prove, effective, communities, often, lashed, out, via, violent, crimes, including, robbery, and, murder, accusations, of, sexual, offenses, also, increased, such, as, adultery, bestiality, and, rape, europeans, sought, explanations, for, the, famine, disease, and, social, unrest, that, they, were, experiencing, and, they, blamed, the, innocent, evidence, from, several, studies, indicate, that, increases, in, violent, actions, against, marginalized, groups, which, were, held, responsible, for, the, little, ice, age, overlap, with, the, years, of, particularly, cold, dry, weather, one, example, of, the, violent, scapegoating, occurring, during, the, little, ice, age, was, the, resurgence, of, witchcraft, trials, oster, 2004, and, behringer, 1999, argue, that, the, resurgence, was, brought, by, the, climatic, decline, prior, to, the, little, ice, age, witchcraft, was, considered, an, insignificant, crime, and, victims, the, supposed, witches, were, rarely, accused, but, beginning, in, the, 1380s, just, as, the, little, ice, age, began, european, populations, began, to, link, magic, and, weather, making, the, first, systematic, witch, hunts, began, in, the, 1430s, and, by, the, 1480s, it, was, widely, believed, that, witches, should, be, held, accountable, for, poor, weather, witches, were, blamed, for, direct, and, indirect, consequences, of, the, little, ice, age, livestock, epidemics, cows, that, gave, too, little, milk, late, frosts, and, unknown, diseases, in, general, the, number, of, witchcraft, trials, rose, as, the, temperature, dropped, and, trials, decreased, when, temperature, increased, the, peaks, of, witchcraft, persecutions, overlap, with, the, hunger, crises, that, occurred, in, 1570, and, 1580, the, latter, lasting, a, decade, the, trials, targeted, primarily, poor, women, many, of, them, widows, not, everybody, agreed, that, witches, should, be, persecuted, for, weather, making, but, such, arguments, focused, primarily, not, upon, whether, witches, existed, but, upon, whether, witches, had, the, capability, to, control, the, weather, the, catholic, church, in, the, early, middle, ages, argued, that, witches, could, not, control, the, weather, because, they, were, mortals, not, god, but, by, the, mid, 13th, century, most, people, agreed, with, the, idea, that, witches, could, control, natural, forces, jewish, populations, were, also, blamed, for, climatic, deterioration, during, the, little, ice, age, the, western, european, states, experienced, waves, of, anti, semitism, directed, against, the, main, religious, minority, in, their, otherwise, christian, societies, there, was, no, direct, link, made, between, jews, and, the, weather, they, were, blamed, only, for, indirect, consequences, such, as, disease, outbreaks, of, the, black, death, were, often, blamed, on, jews, in, western, european, cities, during, the, 1300s, jewish, populations, were, murdered, to, stop, the, spread, of, the, plague, rumors, spread, that, jews, were, either, poisoning, wells, themselves, or, telling, lepers, to, poison, the, wells, to, escape, persecution, some, jews, converted, to, christianity, while, others, migrated, to, the, ottoman, empire, italy, or, the, holy, roman, empire, where, they, experienced, greater, toleration, some, populations, blamed, the, cold, periods, and, the, resulting, famine, and, disease, during, the, little, ice, age, on, a, general, divine, displeasure, particular, groups, took, the, brunt, of, the, burden, in, attempts, to, cure, it, in, germany, regulations, were, imposed, upon, activities, such, as, gambling, and, drinking, which, disproportionately, affected, the, lower, class, and, women, were, forbidden, from, showing, their, knees, other, regulations, affected, the, wider, population, such, as, prohibiting, dancing, sexual, activities, and, moderating, food, and, drink, intake, in, ireland, catholics, blamed, the, reformation, for, the, bad, weather, the, annals, of, loch, c, in, its, entry, for, 1588, describes, a, midsummer, snowstorm, as, a, wild, apple, was, not, larger, than, each, stone, of, it, and, blames, it, on, the, presence, of, a, wicked, heretical, bishop, in, oilfinn, the, protestant, bishop, of, elphin, john, lynch, william, james, burroughs, analyzes, the, depiction, of, winter, in, paintings, as, does, hans, neuberger, burroughs, asserts, that, it, occurred, almost, entirely, from, 1565, to, 1665, and, was, associated, with, the, climatic, decline, from, 1550, onwards, burroughs, claims, that, there, had, been, almost, no, depictions, of, winter, in, art, and, he, hypothesizes, that, the, unusually, harsh, winter, of, 1565, inspired, great, artists, to, depict, highly, original, images, and, that, the, decline, in, such, paintings, was, a, combination, of, the, theme, having, been, fully, explored, and, mild, winters, interrupting, the, flow, of, painting, wintry, scenes, which, entail, technical, difficulties, in, painting, have, been, regularly, and, well, handled, since, at, least, the, early, 15th, century, by, artists, in, illuminated, manuscript, cycles, that, show, the, labours, of, the, months, typically, placed, on, the, calendar, pages, of, books, of, hours, january, and, february, are, typically, shown, as, snowy, as, in, february, in, the, famous, cycle, in, the, tr, s, riches, heures, du, duc, de, berry, painted, in, 1412, 1416, and, illustrated, below, since, landscape, painting, had, not, yet, developed, as, an, independent, genre, in, art, the, absence, of, other, winter, scenes, is, not, remarkable, on, the, other, hand, snowy, winter, landscapes, particularly, stormy, seascapes, became, artistic, genres, in, the, dutch, golden, age, painting, during, the, coldest, and, stormiest, decades, of, the, little, ice, age, most, modern, scholars, believe, them, to, be, full, of, symbolic, messages, and, metaphors, which, would, have, been, clear, to, contemporary, viewers, all, of, the, famous, winter, landscape, paintings, by, pieter, bruegel, the, elder, such, as, the, hunters, in, the, snow, and, the, massacre, of, the, innocents, are, thought, to, have, been, painted, around, 1565, his, son, pieter, brueghel, the, younger, 1564, 1638, also, painted, many, snowy, landscapes, but, according, to, burroughs, he, slavishly, copied, his, father, s, designs, the, derivative, nature, of, so, much, of, this, work, makes, it, difficult, to, draw, any, definite, conclusions, about, the, influence, of, the, winters, between, 1570, and, 1600, in, addition, breugel, painted, hunters, in, the, snow, in, antwerp, so, the, mountains, in, the, picture, probably, mean, it, was, based, on, drawings, or, memories, from, crossing, of, the, alps, during, his, trip, to, rome, in, 1551, 1552, it, is, one, of, 5, known, surviving, paintings, probably, from, a, series, of, 6, or, 12, known, as, the, twelve, months, that, breugel, was, commissioned, to, paint, by, a, wealthy, patron, in, antwerp, nicolaes, jonghelinck, hunters, in, the, snow, being, for, january, none, of, the, other, four, that, survive, show, a, snow, covered, landscape, and, both, the, hay, harvest, july, and, the, harvesters, august, depict, warm, summer, days, even, the, return, of, the, herd, thought, to, be, the, painting, for, november, and, the, gloomy, day, known, to, be, for, february, show, landscapes, free, of, snow, burroughs, says, that, snowy, subjects, return, to, dutch, golden, age, painting, with, works, by, hendrick, avercamp, from, 1609, onwards, there, is, a, hiatus, between, 1627, and, 1640, which, is, before, the, main, period, of, such, subjects, from, the, 1640s, to, the, 1660s, that, relates, well, with, climate, records, for, the, later, period, the, subjects, are, less, popular, after, about, 1660, but, that, does, not, match, any, recorded, reduction, in, severity, of, winters, and, may, reflect, only, changes, in, taste, or, fashion, in, the, later, period, between, the, 1780s, and, 1810s, snowy, subjects, again, became, popular, neuberger, analyzed, 12, 000, paintings, held, in, american, and, european, museums, and, dated, between, 1400, and, 1967, for, cloudiness, and, darkness, his, 1970, publication, shows, an, increase, in, such, depictions, that, corresponds, to, the, little, ice, age, which, peaks, between, 1600, and, 1649, paintings, and, contemporary, records, in, scotland, demonstrate, that, curling, ice, skating, and, icesailing, were, popular, outdoor, winter, sports, with, curling, dating, to, the, 16th, century, and, becoming, widely, popular, in, the, mid, 19th, century, an, outdoor, curling, pond, constructed, in, gourock, in, the, 1860s, remained, in, use, for, almost, a, century, but, increasing, use, of, indoor, facilities, problems, of, vandalism, and, milder, winters, led, to, the, pond, being, abandoned, in, 1963, the, general, crisis, of, the, seventeenth, century, in, europe, was, a, period, of, inclement, weather, crop, failure, economic, hardship, extreme, intergroup, violence, and, high, mortality, linked, to, the, little, ice, age, episodes, of, social, instability, track, the, cooling, with, a, time, lapse, of, up, to, 15, years, and, many, developed, into, armed, conflicts, such, as, the, thirty, years, war, 1618, 1648, the, war, started, as, a, war, of, succession, to, the, bohemian, throne, animosity, between, protestants, and, catholics, in, the, holy, roman, empire, now, germany, added, fuel, to, the, fire, it, soon, escalated, to, a, huge, conflict, that, involved, all, the, major, european, powers, and, devastated, much, of, germany, when, the, war, ended, some, regions, of, the, holy, roman, empire, had, seen, their, population, drop, by, as, much, as, 70, early, european, explorers, and, settlers, of, north, america, reported, exceptionally, severe, winters, in, southwestern, alaska, preexisting, flexibility, in, foraging, habits, among, the, native, people, lent, itself, to, high, adaptability, to, the, lia, both, europeans, and, indigenous, peoples, suffered, excess, mortality, in, maine, during, the, winter, of, 1607, 1608, and, extreme, frost, was, meanwhile, reported, in, the, jamestown, virginia, settlement, native, americans, formed, leagues, in, response, to, food, shortages, the, journal, of, pierre, de, troyes, chevalier, de, troyes, who, led, an, expedition, to, james, bay, in, 1686, recorded, that, the, bay, was, still, littered, with, so, much, floating, ice, that, he, could, hide, behind, it, in, his, canoe, on, 1, july, in, the, winter, of, 1780, new, york, harbor, froze, which, allowed, people, to, walk, from, manhattan, island, to, staten, island, the, extent, of, mountain, glaciers, had, been, mapped, by, the, late, 19th, century, in, the, north, and, the, south, temperate, zones, equilibrium, line, altitude, the, boundaries, separating, zones, of, net, accumulation, from, those, of, net, ablation, were, about, 100, metres, 330, ft, lower, than, they, were, in, 1975, southwestern, alaska, experienced, a, tamperature, nadir, around, 135, bp, and, in, south, central, alaska, mountain, hemlock, forests, severely, declined, in, glacier, national, park, the, last, episode, of, glacier, advance, came, in, the, late, 18th, and, the, early, 19th, centuries, in, 1879, the, famed, naturalist, john, muir, found, that, glacier, bay, ice, had, retreated, 48, miles, 77, km, in, chesapeake, bay, maryland, large, temperature, excursions, were, possibly, related, to, changes, in, the, strength, of, the, north, atlantic, thermohaline, circulation, because, the, little, ice, age, took, place, during, the, european, colonization, of, the, americas, it, discouraged, many, early, colonists, who, had, expected, the, climate, of, north, america, to, be, similar, to, the, climate, of, europe, at, similar, latitudes, they, found, that, north, america, at, least, in, what, would, become, canada, and, the, northern, united, states, had, hotter, summers, and, colder, winters, than, europe, that, effect, was, aggravated, by, the, little, ice, age, and, unpreparedness, led, to, the, collapse, of, many, early, european, settlements, in, north, america, historians, agree, that, when, colonists, settled, at, jamestown, it, was, one, of, the, coldest, periods, in, the, last, 1000, years, drought, was, also, a, problem, in, north, america, during, the, little, ice, age, and, the, settlers, arrived, in, roanoke, during, the, largest, drought, of, the, past, 800, years, tree, ring, studies, by, the, university, of, arkansas, discovered, that, many, colonists, arrived, at, the, beginning, of, a, seven, year, drought, the, droughts, also, decreased, the, native, american, populations, and, led, to, conflict, because, of, food, scarcity, english, colonists, at, roanoke, forced, native, americans, of, ossomocomuck, to, share, their, depleted, supplies, with, them, that, led, to, warfare, between, the, two, groups, and, native, american, towns, were, destroyed, that, cycle, would, repeat, itself, many, times, at, jamestown, the, combination, of, fighting, and, cold, weather, also, led, to, the, spread, of, diseases, the, colder, weather, helped, the, parasites, brought, by, europeans, in, mosquitoes, to, develop, faster, that, in, turn, led, to, many, malaria, deaths, among, native, americans, in, 1642, thomas, gorges, wrote, that, between, 1637, and, 1645, colonists, in, maine, then, part, of, massachusetts, experienced, horrendous, weather, conditions, in, june, 1637, temperatures, were, so, high, that, numerous, european, settlers, died, travelers, were, forced, to, travel, at, night, to, stay, cool, gorges, also, wrote, that, the, winter, of, 1641, 1642, was, piercingly, intolerable, and, that, no, englishman, or, native, american, had, ever, seen, anything, like, it, he, also, stated, that, the, massachusetts, bay, had, frozen, as, far, as, one, could, see, and, that, horse, carriages, now, roamed, where, ships, used, to, be, he, stated, that, the, summers, of, 1638, and, 1639, were, very, short, cold, and, wet, which, compounded, food, scarcity, for, a, few, years, to, make, matters, worse, creatures, like, caterpillars, and, pigeons, fed, on, crops, and, devastated, harvests, every, year, about, which, gorges, wrote, featured, unusual, weather, patterns, including, high, precipitation, drought, and, extreme, cold, or, heat, many, inhabitants, of, north, america, had, their, own, theories, about, the, extreme, weather, the, colonist, ferdinando, gorges, blamed, the, cold, weather, on, cold, ocean, winds, humphrey, gilbert, tried, to, explain, newfoundland, s, icy, and, foggy, weather, by, saying, that, the, earth, drew, cold, vapors, from, the, ocean, and, drew, them, west, many, others, had, their, own, theories, for, north, america, being, so, much, colder, than, europe, their, observations, and, hypotheses, offer, insight, on, the, little, ice, age, s, effects, in, north, america, an, analysis, of, several, climate, proxies, undertaken, in, mexico, s, yucat, n, peninsula, which, was, linked, by, its, authors, to, maya, and, aztec, chronicles, relating, periods, of, cold, and, drought, supports, the, existence, of, the, little, ice, age, in, the, region, another, study, conducted, in, several, sites, in, mesoamerica, like, los, tuxtlas, and, lake, pompal, in, veracruz, mexico, show, a, decrease, in, human, activity, in, the, area, during, the, little, ice, age, that, was, proven, by, studying, charcoal, fragments, and, the, amount, of, maize, pollen, taken, from, sedimentary, samples, by, using, a, nonrotatory, piston, corer, the, samples, also, showed, volcanic, activity, which, caused, forest, regeneration, between, 650, and, 800, the, instances, of, volcanic, activity, near, lake, pompal, indicate, varying, temperatures, not, a, continuous, coldness, during, the, little, ice, age, in, mesoamerica, in, the, north, atlantic, sediments, accumulated, since, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, which, occurred, nearly, 12, 000, years, ago, show, regular, increases, in, the, amount, of, coarse, sediment, grains, deposited, from, icebergs, melting, in, the, now, open, ocean, indicating, a, series, of, 1, 2, c, 2, 4, f, cooling, events, that, recur, every, 1, 500, years, or, so, the, most, recent, cooling, event, was, the, little, ice, age, the, same, cooling, events, are, detected, in, sediments, accumulating, off, africa, but, the, cooling, events, appear, to, be, larger, 3, 8, c, 6, 14, f, 18, o, values, from, chironomid, remains, in, the, azores, reflect, the, cooling, of, the, lia, although, the, original, designation, of, a, little, ice, age, referred, to, the, reduced, temperature, of, europe, and, north, america, there, is, some, evidence, of, extended, periods, of, cooling, outside, those, regions, although, it, is, not, clear, whether, they, are, related, or, independent, events, mann, states, while, there, is, evidence, that, many, other, regions, outside, europe, exhibited, periods, of, cooler, conditions, expanded, glaciation, and, significantly, altered, climate, conditions, the, timing, and, nature, of, these, variations, are, highly, variable, from, region, to, region, and, the, notion, of, the, little, ice, age, as, a, globally, synchronous, cold, period, has, all, but, been, dismissed, in, china, warm, weather, crops, such, as, oranges, were, abandoned, in, jiangxi, province, where, they, had, been, grown, for, centuries, also, the, two, periods, of, most, frequent, typhoon, strikes, in, guangdong, coincide, with, two, of, the, coldest, and, driest, periods, in, northern, and, central, china, 1660, 1680, 1850, 1880, scholars, have, argued, that, one, of, the, reasons, for, the, fall, of, the, ming, dynasty, may, have, been, the, droughts, and, famines, that, were, caused, by, the, little, ice, age, there, are, debates, on, the, start, date, and, the, periods, of, little, ice, age, s, effects, most, scholars, agree, on, categorizing, the, little, ice, age, period, into, three, distinct, cold, periods, in, 1458, 1552, 1600, 1720, and, 1840, 1880, according, to, data, from, the, u, s, national, oceanic, and, atmospheric, administration, the, eastern, monsoon, area, of, china, was, the, earliest, to, experience, the, effects, of, the, little, ice, age, from, 1560, to, 1709, in, the, western, region, of, china, surrounding, the, tibetan, plateau, the, effects, of, the, little, ice, age, lagged, behind, the, eastern, region, with, significant, cold, periods, from, 1620, to, 1749, as, the, medieval, warm, period, transitioned, into, the, little, ice, age, the, east, asian, summer, monsoon, easm, became, much, weaker, and, the, summer, monsoon, limit, sml, migrated, southeastwards, southwestern, china, became, significantly, colder, and, drier, as, a, result, of, the, weakening, of, the, easm, caused, by, the, decreased, pressure, gradient, resulting, from, the, cooling, of, the, southern, eurasian, landmass, while, northwestern, china, dominated, by, westerlies, saw, an, increase, in, precipitation, the, temperature, changes, were, unprecedented, for, the, farming, communities, in, china, according, to, coching, chu, s, 1972, study, the, little, ice, age, from, the, end, of, the, ming, dynasty, to, the, start, of, the, qing, dynasty, 1650, 1700, was, one, of, the, coldest, periods, in, recorded, chinese, history, many, major, droughts, during, the, summer, months, were, recorded, and, significant, freezing, events, occurred, during, the, winter, months, that, greatly, worsened, the, food, supply, during, the, ming, dynasty, this, period, of, little, ice, age, corresponded, to, the, period, s, major, historical, events, the, jurchen, people, lived, in, northern, china, and, formed, a, tributary, state, to, the, ming, dynasty, and, its, wanli, emperor, from, 1573, to, 1620, manchuria, experienced, famine, caused, by, extreme, snowfall, which, depleted, agriculture, production, and, devastated, the, livestock, population, scholars, have, argued, that, it, had, been, caused, by, the, temperature, drops, during, the, little, ice, age, despite, the, lack, of, food, production, the, wanli, emperor, ordered, the, jurchens, to, pay, the, same, amount, of, tribute, each, year, that, led, to, anger, and, sowed, seeds, to, the, rebellion, against, the, ming, dynasty, in, 1616, jurchens, established, the, later, jin, dynasty, led, by, hong, taiji, and, nurhaci, the, later, jin, dynasty, moved, south, and, achieved, decisive, victories, in, battles, against, the, ming, dynasty, s, military, such, as, during, the, 1618, battle, of, fushun, after, the, earlier, defeats, and, the, death, of, the, wanli, emperor, the, chongzhen, emperor, took, over, china, and, continued, the, war, effort, from, 1632, to, 1641, the, little, ice, age, began, to, cause, drastic, climate, changes, in, the, ming, dynasty, s, territories, for, example, rainfall, in, the, huabei, region, dropped, by, 11, to, 47, from, the, historical, average, meanwhile, the, shaanbei, region, along, the, yellow, river, experienced, six, major, floods, which, ruined, cities, such, as, yan, an, the, climate, factored, heavily, in, weakening, the, government, s, control, over, china, and, accelerated, the, fall, of, the, ming, dynasty, in, 1644, li, zicheng, led, the, later, jin, s, forces, into, beijing, overthrew, the, ming, dynasty, and, established, the, short, lived, shun, dynasty, which, were, soon, overthrown, by, qing, dynasty, during, the, early, years, of, the, qing, dynasty, the, little, ice, age, continued, to, have, a, significant, impact, on, chinese, society, during, the, rule, of, the, kangxi, emperor, 1661, 1722, most, qing, territories, were, still, much, colder, than, the, historical, average, however, the, kangxi, emperor, pushed, reforms, and, managed, to, increase, the, socio, economic, recovery, from, the, natural, disasters, he, benefited, partly, from, the, peacefulness, of, the, early, qing, dynasty, that, essentially, marked, the, end, of, the, little, ice, age, in, china, and, led, to, a, more, prosperous, era, of, chinese, history, that, is, known, as, the, high, qing, era, in, the, himalayas, the, general, assumption, is, that, the, cooling, events, were, synchronous, with, those, in, europe, during, the, little, ice, age, because, of, the, characteristics, of, moraines, however, applications, of, quaternary, dating, methods, such, as, surface, exposure, dating, have, showed, that, glacial, maxima, occurred, between, 1300, and, 1600, slightly, earlier, than, the, recorded, coldest, period, in, the, northern, hemisphere, many, large, himalayan, glacial, debris, fields, have, remained, close, to, their, limits, since, the, little, ice, age, the, himalayas, also, experienced, an, increase, in, snowfall, at, higher, altitudes, which, results, in, a, southward, shift, in, the, indian, summer, monsoon, and, an, increase, in, precipitation, overall, the, increase, in, winter, precipitation, may, have, caused, some, glacial, movements, since, the, end, of, the, little, ice, age, there, has, been, an, almost, continuous, retreat, of, glaciers, to, present, the, region, in, balochistan, became, colder, and, its, native, baloch, people, started, a, mass, migration, and, began, to, settle, along, the, indus, river, in, sindh, and, punjab, on, rebun, island, a, rapid, cooling, event, occurred, around, 390, bp, amidst, a, longer, term, trend, of, cooling, this, cooling, event, marked, the, onset, of, the, little, ice, age, in, the, region, the, little, ice, age, influenced, the, african, climate, from, the, 14th, to, the, 19th, centuries, despite, variances, throughout, the, continent, a, general, trend, of, declining, temperatures, in, africa, led, to, an, average, cooling, of, 1, c, in, ethiopia, and, north, africa, permanent, snow, was, reported, on, mountain, peaks, at, levels, at, which, it, does, not, occur, today, timbuktu, an, important, city, on, the, trans, saharan, caravan, route, was, flooded, at, least, 13, times, by, the, niger, river, but, there, are, no, records, of, similar, flooding, before, or, since, that, time, several, paleoclimatic, studies, of, southern, africa, have, suggested, significant, changes, in, relative, changes, in, climate, and, environmental, conditions, in, southern, africa, sediment, cores, retrieved, from, lake, malawi, show, colder, conditions, between, 1570, and, 1820, which, further, support, and, extend, the, global, expanse, of, the, little, ice, age, a, novel, 3, 000, year, temperature, reconstruction, method, based, on, the, rate, of, stalagmite, growth, in, a, cold, cave, in, south, africa, further, suggests, a, cold, period, from, 1500, to, 1800, characterizing, the, south, african, little, ice, age, the, 18o, stalagmite, record, temperature, reconstruction, over, a, 350, year, period, 1690, 1740, suggests, that, south, africa, may, have, been, the, coldest, region, in, africa, and, have, cooled, by, as, much, as, 1, 4, c, in, summer, also, the, solar, magnetic, and, ni, o, southern, oscillation, cycles, may, have, been, key, drivers, of, climate, variability, in, the, subtropical, region, periglacial, features, in, the, eastern, lesotho, highlands, might, have, been, reactivated, by, the, little, ice, age, another, archaeological, reconstruction, of, south, africa, reveals, the, rise, of, the, great, zimbabwe, people, because, of, ecological, advantages, from, the, increased, rainfall, over, other, competitor, societies, such, as, the, mupungubwe, people, pollen, records, derived, from, rock, hyrax, middens, in, the, cederberg, mountains, of, southwestern, south, africa, indicate, an, increase, in, humidity, in, the, region, at, the, start, of, the, lia, other, than, temperature, variability, data, from, equatorial, east, africa, suggest, impacts, to, the, hydrologic, cycle, in, the, late, 1700s, historical, data, reconstructions, from, ten, major, african, lakes, indicate, that, an, episode, of, drought, and, desiccation, occurred, throughout, east, africa, the, period, showed, drastic, reductions, in, the, depths, of, lakes, which, were, transformed, into, desiccated, puddles, it, is, very, likely, that, locals, could, cross, lake, chad, among, others, and, that, bouts, of, intense, droughts, were, ubiquitous, that, indicates, local, societies, were, probably, launched, into, long, migrations, and, warfare, with, neighboring, tribes, since, agriculture, was, made, virtually, useless, by, the, dry, soil, kreutz, et, al, 1997, compared, results, from, studies, of, west, antarctic, ice, cores, with, the, greenland, ice, sheet, project, two, gisp2, they, suggested, a, synchronous, global, cooling, an, ocean, sediment, core, from, the, eastern, bransfield, basin, in, the, antarctic, peninsula, shows, centennial, events, which, the, authors, link, to, the, little, ice, age, and, to, the, medieval, warm, period, the, authors, note, that, other, unexplained, climatic, events, comparable, in, duration, and, amplitude, to, the, lia, and, mwp, events, also, appear, the, siple, dome, sd, had, a, climate, event, with, an, onset, time, that, is, coincident, with, that, of, the, little, ice, age, in, the, north, atlantic, based, on, a, correlation, with, the, gisp2, record, the, little, ice, age, is, the, most, dramatic, climate, event, in, the, sd, holocene, glaciochemical, record, the, siple, dome, ice, core, also, contained, its, highest, rate, of, melt, layers, up, to, 8, between, 1550, and, 1700, most, likely, because, of, warm, summers, law, dome, ice, cores, show, lower, levels, of, co, 2, mixing, ratios, from, 1550, to, 1800, which, etheridge, and, steele, believe, to, be, probably, as, a, result, of, colder, global, climate, sediment, cores, in, bransfield, basin, antarctic, peninsula, have, neoglacial, indicators, by, diatom, and, sea, ice, taxa, variations, during, the, little, ice, age, stable, isotope, records, from, the, mount, erebus, saddle, ice, core, site, suggests, that, the, ross, sea, region, experienced, average, temperatures, 1, 6, 1, 4, c, cooler, during, the, little, ice, age, than, the, last, 150, years, its, location, in, the, southern, hemisphere, made, australia, not, experience, a, regional, cooling, like, that, of, europe, or, north, america, instead, the, australian, little, ice, age, was, characterized, by, humid, rainy, climates, which, were, followed, by, drying, and, aridification, in, the, 19th, century, as, studied, by, tibby, et, al, 2018, lake, records, from, victoria, new, south, wales, and, queensland, suggest, that, conditions, in, the, east, and, the, south, east, of, australia, were, wet, and, unusually, cool, from, the, 16th, to, the, early, 19th, centuries, that, corresponds, with, the, peak, of, the, global, little, ice, age, from, 1594, to, 1722, for, example, north, stradbroke, island, s, swallow, lagoon, data, reveals, a, period, of, persistent, wetness, from, 1500, to, 1850, ce, exceeding, 300, mm, above, average, followed, by, a, significant, decrease, in, rainfall, after, 1891, the, rainfalls, significantly, reduced, after, around, 1890, similarly, the, hydrological, records, of, lake, surprise, s, salinity, levels, reveal, high, humidity, levels, around, from, 1440, to, 1880, and, an, increase, in, salinity, from, 1860, to, 1880, points, to, a, negative, change, to, the, once, humid, climate, the, mid, 19th, century, marked, a, notable, change, to, eastern, australia, s, rainfall, and, humidity, patterns, tibby, et, al, 2018, note, that, in, eastern, australia, the, paleoclimatic, changes, of, the, little, ice, age, in, the, late, 1800s, coincided, with, the, agricultural, changes, resulting, from, european, colonization, after, the, 1788, establishment, of, british, colonies, in, the, australia, which, were, concentrated, primarily, in, the, eastern, regions, and, cities, like, sydney, and, later, melbourne, and, brisbane, the, british, introduced, new, agricultural, practices, like, pastoralism, such, practices, required, widespread, deforestation, and, clearance, of, vegetation, pastoralism, and, the, clearing, of, land, are, captured, in, works, of, art, such, as, the, 1833, painting, by, the, prominent, landscape, artist, john, glover, patterdale, landscape, with, cattle, over, the, next, century, the, deforestation, led, to, a, loss, of, biodiversity, wind, and, water, based, soil, erosion, and, soil, salinity, furthermore, as, argued, by, gordan, et, al, 2003, such, land, and, vegetation, clearance, in, australia, resulted, in, a, 10, reduction, in, the, transport, of, water, vapor, to, the, atmosphere, that, occurred, in, western, australia, as, well, where, 19th, century, land, clearing, resulted, in, reduced, rainfall, over, the, region, by, 1850, to, 1890, those, human, agricultural, practices, which, were, concentrated, in, eastern, australia, had, most, likely, amplified, the, drying, and, aridification, that, marked, the, end, of, the, little, ice, age, in, the, north, evidence, suggests, fairly, dry, conditions, but, coral, cores, from, the, great, barrier, reef, show, rainfall, similar, to, today, but, with, less, variability, a, study, that, analyzed, isotopes, in, great, barrier, reef, corals, suggested, that, increased, water, vapor, transport, from, the, southern, tropical, oceans, to, the, poles, contributed, to, the, little, ice, age, borehole, reconstructions, from, australia, suggest, that, over, the, last, 500, years, the, 17th, century, was, the, coldest, on, the, continent, the, borehole, temperature, reconstruction, method, further, indicates, that, the, warming, of, australia, over, the, past, five, centuries, is, only, around, half, that, of, the, warming, experienced, by, the, northern, hemisphere, which, further, proves, that, australia, did, not, reach, the, same, depths, of, cooling, as, the, continents, in, the, north, on, the, west, coast, of, the, southern, alps, of, new, zealand, the, franz, josef, glacier, advanced, rapidly, during, the, little, ice, age, and, reached, its, maximum, extent, in, the, early, 18th, century, that, was, one, of, the, few, cases, of, a, glacier, thrusting, into, a, rainforest, evidence, suggests, corroborated, by, tree, ring, proxy, data, that, the, glacier, contributed, to, a, 0, 56, c, 1, 01, f, temperature, anomaly, over, the, course, of, the, little, ice, age, in, new, zealand, based, on, dating, of, a, yellow, green, lichen, of, the, rhizocarpon, subgenus, the, mueller, glacier, on, the, eastern, flank, of, the, southern, alps, within, aoraki, mount, cook, national, park, is, considered, to, have, been, at, its, maximum, extent, between, 1725, and, 1730, sea, level, data, for, the, pacific, islands, suggest, that, sea, level, in, the, region, fell, possibly, in, two, stages, between, 1270, and, 1475, that, was, associated, with, a, 1, 5, c, fall, in, temperature, as, determined, from, oxygen, isotope, analysis, and, an, observed, increase, in, the, frequency, of, el, ni, o, tropical, pacific, coral, records, indicate, the, most, frequent, and, intense, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, activity, was, in, the, mid, 17th, century, foraminiferal, 18, o, records, indicate, that, the, indo, pacific, warm, pool, was, warm, and, saline, between, 1000, and, 1400, with, temperatures, approximating, current, conditions, but, that, it, cooled, from, 1400, onwards, and, reached, its, lowest, temperatures, in, 1700, that, is, consistent, with, the, transition, from, the, mid, holocene, warming, to, the, little, ice, age, the, nearby, southwestern, pacific, however, experienced, warmer, than, average, conditions, over, the, course, of, the, little, ice, age, which, is, thought, to, be, from, the, increased, trade, winds, which, increased, the, evaporation, and, the, salinity, in, the, region, the, dramatic, temperature, differences, between, the, higher, latitudes, and, the, equator, are, thought, to, have, resulted, in, drier, conditions, in, the, subtropics, independent, multiproxy, analyses, of, raraku, lake, sedimentology, mineralology, organic, and, inorganic, geochemistry, etc, indicate, that, easter, island, was, subject, to, two, phases, of, arid, climate, that, led, to, drought, the, first, occurred, between, 500, and, 1200, and, the, second, occurring, during, the, little, ice, age, from, 1570, to, 1720, in, between, both, arid, phases, the, island, enjoyed, a, humid, period, from, 1200, to, 1570, that, coincided, with, the, peak, of, the, rapa, nui, civilization, tree, ring, data, from, patagonia, show, cold, episodes, from, 1270, and, 1380, and, from, 1520, to, 1670, during, the, events, in, the, northern, hemisphere, eight, sediment, cores, taken, from, puyehue, lake, have, been, interpreted, as, showing, a, humid, period, from, 1470, to, 1700, which, the, authors, describe, as, a, regional, marker, of, the, onset, of, the, little, ice, age, a, 2009, paper, details, cooler, and, wetter, conditions, in, southeastern, south, america, between, 1550, and, 1800, by, citing, evidence, obtained, via, several, proxies, and, models, 18, o, records, from, three, andean, ice, cores, show, a, cool, period, from, 1600, to, 1800, although, it, is, only, anecdotal, evidence, the, antonio, de, vea, expedition, entered, san, rafael, lake, in, 1675, through, r, o, t, mpanos, spanish, for, ice, floe, river, the, spanish, mentioned, no, ice, floe, but, stated, that, the, san, rafael, glacier, did, not, reach, far, into, the, lagoon, in, 1766, another, expedition, noticed, that, the, glacier, reached, the, lagoon, and, calved, into, large, icebergs, hans, steffen, visited, the, area, in, 1898, and, noticed, that, the, glacier, penetrated, far, into, the, lagoon, such, historical, records, indicate, a, general, cooling, in, the, area, between, 1675, and, 1898, the, recognition, of, the, lia, in, northern, patagonia, through, the, use, of, documentary, sources, provides, important, independent, evidence, for, the, occurrence, of, this, phenomenon, in, the, region, as, of, 2001, the, borders, of, the, glacier, had, significantly, retreated, from, those, of, 1675, it, has, been, suggested, that, all, glaciers, of, gran, campo, nevado, next, to, the, strait, of, magellan, reached, their, largest, extent, of, the, whole, holocene, epoch, during, the, little, ice, age, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, little, ice, age, locally, lasting, from, the, 17th, to, the, 19th, centuries, may, have, had, a, negative, impact, on, the, productivity, of, marine, ecosystems, and, on, the, navigability, of, the, patagonian, fjords, and, channels, being, thus, detrimental, to, the, sea, faring, kaw, sqar, the, ottoman, lia, occurred, from, the, early, 14th, century, until, the, mid, 19th, century, with, its, most, intense, phase, taking, place, between, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, from, the, 14th, to, 15th, century, the, ottoman, empire, transformed, from, a, small, group, of, soldiers, to, a, major, world, power, by, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, the, lia, began, and, had, a, profound, impact, on, the, ottoman, economy, society, and, culture, during, february, 1621, it, is, noted, that, the, bosphorus, strait, in, istanbul, had, frozen, over, completely, in, the, years, 1265, 1277, and, 1297, 1298, byzantine, sources, describe, extremely, harsh, cold, also, around, 1300, there, were, harsh, winters, in, 1298, 1299, in, the, middle, east, this, is, followed, by, a, drought, which, takes, place, in, asia, minor, in, 1302, 1304, while, there, is, the, flooding, of, the, sangarious, river, in, the, summer, of, 1302, the, ottoman, empire, whose, territories, stretched, across, three, continents, and, its, economy, was, based, on, agriculture, and, trade, had, a, diverse, range, of, climates, and, ecosystems, and, was, greatly, affected, by, this, phenomenon, the, ottoman, empire, was, one, of, the, largest, and, most, powerful, empires, in, the, world, during, the, little, ice, age, the, effects, of, the, little, ice, age, on, the, ottoman, empire, were, significant, leading, to, changes, in, agricultural, practices, increased, food, prices, and, social, unrest, during, the, 1590s, the, beginning, of, a, wave, of, extremely, cold, winters, began, and, the, middle, eastern, longest, drought, in, six, centuries, marked, the, beginning, of, the, little, ice, age, in, the, middle, east, due, to, the, expansion, of, the, ottoman, empire, in, the, late, 16th, century, the, population, of, the, empire, reached, around, 30, million, people, which, led, to, a, shortage, of, land, and, an, increase, in, tax, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, century, included, inflation, and, rising, cost, in, both, the, middle, east, and, europe, the, effect, of, this, large, population, and, lack, of, supplies, created, a, strain, on, the, ottoman, government, the, cooling, climate, disrupted, agricultural, production, leading, to, food, shortages, and, famines, the, ottoman, empire, did, not, often, have, a, shortage, of, grain, due, to, its, location, close, to, the, danube, nile, and, the, black, sea, however, once, the, little, ice, age, began, that, all, changed, and, grain, was, rare, due, to, the, cooler, temperatures, which, led, to, a, shorter, growing, season, resulting, in, lower, crop, yields, and, decreased, food, production, the, effects, of, the, colder, climate, were, exacerbated, by, extreme, weather, events, such, as, droughts, floods, and, storms, which, further, reduced, crop, yields, each, ancient, middle, eastern, empire, had, a, significant, supply, of, food, the, byzantines, had, anatolia, and, syria, the, abbasids, had, the, lower, tigris, euphrates, region, as, well, as, khurasan, and, bukhara, and, the, ottomans, had, egypt, however, there, was, an, inherent, political, risk, in, such, agricultural, dependency, which, finally, materialised, farmers, who, are, unable, or, unwilling, to, relocate, may, be, driven, into, revolt, against, the, established, authority, if, weather, patterns, shift, nomads, had, the, flexibility, to, move, in, response, to, climate, shifts, unlike, settled, peasants, who, weren, t, willing, to, leave, their, traditional, lands, the, impact, of, the, little, ice, age, on, the, ottoman, empire, was, not, limited, to, agriculture, and, trade, the, cooling, climate, led, to, changes, in, migration, patterns, as, some, regions, became, uninhabitable, while, others, became, more, attractive, this, in, turn, affected, the, demographics, of, the, empire, and, contributed, to, the, emergence, of, new, political, and, social, structures, the, lengthy, drought, as, well, as, the, cold, winters, led, to, the, destruction, of, imperial, systems, which, all, led, to, a, series, of, uprisings, collectively, known, as, the, celali, rebellion, c, 1596, 1610, the, rebellion, became, the, longest, lasting, internal, challenge, to, state, power, in, the, ottoman, empire, s, six, centuries, of, existence, the, goal, of, the, celali, rebellion, was, not, to, overthrow, the, ottoman, government, instead, it, was, an, attempt, to, get, newly, appointed, governorships, the, ottoman, empire, did, not, fully, recover, from, the, little, ice, age, for, around, a, hundred, years, even, then, they, were, considered, weakened, with, a, large, population, loss, the, central, england, temperature, cet, is, the, longest, instrumental, temperature, record, in, existence, anywhere, in, the, world, and, extends, back, continuously, from, the, present, day, to, 1659, hence, it, starts, in, the, middle, of, the, little, ice, age, lia, however, the, lia, interval, is, defined, cet, holds, some, very, important, implications, for, our, understanding, of, the, lia, the, cet, data, show, that, during, the, lia, there, was, an, increased, occurrence, of, exceptionally, cold, winters, and, these, years, coincided, with, years, when, frost, fairs, were, held, on, the, thames, and, when, exceptionally, low, temperatures, were, reported, elsewhere, in, europe, it, also, agrees, well, with, paleoclimate, estimates, in, average, trends, however, winters, were, not, unremittingly, cold, during, the, lia, in, the, cet, record, for, example, the, coldest, winter, defined, by, the, average, temperature, for, december, january, and, february, in, the, whole, cet, data, series, is, 1684, the, year, of, one, of, the, most, famous, frost, fairs, yet, the, fifth, warmest, winter, in, the, whole, cet, data, series, to, date, occurred, just, two, years, later, in, 1686, furthermore, summer, temperatures, are, not, greatly, depressed, during, the, lia, and, when, they, are, these, lower, temperatures, correlate, highly, with, volcanic, eruptions, hence, the, cet, data, strongly, argue, that, the, lia, at, least, in, europe, should, be, regarded, as, a, period, of, enhanced, occurrence, of, exceptionally, cold, winters, and, hence, lower, average, temperatures, and, not, as, an, interval, of, unremitting, cold, scientists, have, tentatively, identified, seven, possible, causes, of, the, little, ice, age, orbital, cycles, decreased, solar, activity, increased, volcanic, activity, altered, ocean, current, flows, fluctuations, in, the, human, population, in, different, parts, of, the, world, causing, reforestation, or, deforestation, and, the, inherent, variability, of, global, climate, orbital, forcing, from, cycles, in, the, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, has, for, the, past, 2, 000, years, caused, a, long, term, northern, hemisphere, cooling, trend, which, continued, through, the, middle, ages, and, the, little, ice, age, the, rate, of, arctic, cooling, is, roughly, 0, 02, c, per, century, that, trend, could, be, extrapolated, to, continue, into, the, future, and, possibly, lead, to, a, full, ice, age, but, the, 20th, century, instrumental, temperature, record, shows, a, sudden, reversal, of, that, trend, with, a, rise, in, global, temperatures, attributed, to, greenhouse, gas, emissions, solar, activity, includes, any, disturbances, on, the, sun, such, as, sunspots, and, solar, flares, associated, with, the, variable, magnetic, field, of, the, solar, surface, and, solar, atmosphere, corona, because, alfv, n, s, theorem, applies, the, coronal, magnetic, field, is, dragged, out, into, the, heliosphere, by, the, solar, wind, irregularities, in, this, heliospheric, magnetic, field, shield, earth, from, galactic, cosmic, rays, by, scattering, them, which, allows, scientists, to, track, solar, activity, in, the, past, by, analyzing, both, the, carbon, 14, or, beryllium, 10, isotopes, generated, by, cosmic, rays, hitting, the, atmosphere, and, which, are, deposited, in, terrestrial, reservoirs, such, as, tree, rings, and, ice, sheets, in, the, intervals, 1400, 1550, the, sp, rer, minimum, and, 1645, 1715, the, maunder, minimum, there, were, very, low, recorded, levels, of, solar, activity, and, they, are, both, within, or, at, least, overlapped, with, the, lia, for, most, definitions, however, solar, activity, deduced, from, cosmogenic, isotopes, was, as, high, between, the, sp, rer, minimum, and, the, maunder, minimum, as, it, was, in, about, 1940, yet, this, interval, is, also, within, the, lia, hence, any, relationship, between, solar, activity, and, the, lia, is, far, from, a, simple, one, a, drop, in, solar, activity, circa, 1230, ad, as, measured, by, biogenic, silica, corrected, ignition, residue, ir, bsi, has, been, suggested, by, one, study, as, a, forcing, potentially, responsible, for, initiating, the, lia, with, the, authors, noting, that, this, drop, in, solar, output, preceded, the, onset, of, significant, volcanism, a, study, by, dmitri, mauquoy, et, al, confirmed, that, at, the, beginning, of, the, sp, rer, minimum, the, carbon, 14, production, rate, rose, rapidly, these, authors, argued, this, rise, coincided, with, a, sharp, drop, in, temperatures, deduced, from, european, peat, bogs, this, temperature, drop, is, also, seen, in, mean, northern, hemisphere, temperatures, deduced, from, a, wide, variety, of, paleoclimate, indicators, but, the, timing, of, the, onset, of, the, sp, rer, minimum, is, actually, some, 50, years, earlier, a, 50, year, response, lag, is, possible, but, is, not, consistent, with, subsequent, variations, in, inferred, solar, activity, and, average, northern, hemisphere, temperature, for, example, the, peak, in, solar, activity, between, the, sp, rer, minimum, and, the, maunder, minimum, is, 50, years, after, the, only, peak, in, average, northern, hemisphere, temperature, that, it, could, be, associated, with, a, study, by, judith, lean, in, 1999, also, pointed, to, a, relationship, between, the, sun, and, the, little, ice, age, her, research, found, that, there, was, a, 0, 13, total, solar, irradiance, tsi, increase, 1, 8, w, m, 1, displaystyle, 1, 8wm, 1, over, 1650, 1790, which, could, have, raised, the, temperature, of, the, earth, by, 0, 3, c, in, the, calculated, correlation, coefficients, of, the, global, temperature, response, to, their, reconstruction, of, the, solar, forcing, over, three, different, periods, they, found, an, average, coefficient, of, 0, 79, i, e, 62, of, the, variation, could, be, explained, by, the, tsi, which, indicates, a, possible, relationship, between, the, two, components, lean, s, team, also, formulated, an, equation, in, which, the, temperature, change, is, 0, 16, c, increase, in, temperature, for, every, 0, 1, increase, in, total, solar, irradiance, however, the, main, problem, with, quantifying, the, longer, term, trends, in, tsi, lies, in, the, stability, of, the, absolute, radiometry, measurements, made, from, space, which, has, improved, since, the, pioneering, work, of, judith, lean, discussed, above, but, still, remains, a, problem, analysis, comparing, trends, in, modern, observations, of, tsi, and, cosmic, ray, fluxes, shows, that, the, uncertainties, mean, that, it, is, possible, that, tsi, was, actually, higher, in, the, maunder, minimum, than, present, day, levels, but, uncertainties, are, high, with, best, estimates, of, the, difference, between, the, modern, day, tsi, and, the, maunder, minimum, tsi, in, the, range, 0, 5, w, m, 1, displaystyle, 0, 5wm, 1, but, with, a, 2, displaystyle, 2, sigma, uncertainty, range, of, 1, w, m, 1, displaystyle, 1wm, 1, at, the, center, of, the, lia, during, the, sp, rer, minimum, and, the, maunder, minimum, sunspots, were, minimal, and, cosmogenic, isotope, deposition, carbon, 14, and, beryllium, 10, was, increased, in, these, minima, as, a, result, however, detailed, studies, from, multiple, paleoclimate, indicators, show, that, the, lower, northern, hemisphere, temperatures, in, the, little, ice, age, began, before, the, start, of, the, maunder, minimum, but, after, the, start, of, the, sp, rer, minimum, and, persisted, until, after, the, maunder, minimum, and, even, after, the, much, weaker, dalton, minimum, had, ceased, the, return, to, more, active, solar, conditions, between, these, two, grand, solar, minima, had, no, obvious, effect, on, either, global, or, northern, hemisphere, temperatures, the, central, england, temperature, provide, evidence, that, low, solar, activity, may, have, contributed, to, the, lia, through, the, increased, occurrence, of, cold, winters, at, least, in, europe, but, colder, summers, are, more, correlated, with, volcanic, activity, comparison, of, tsi, records, with, greenland, ice, core, 18, o, trends, suggests, that, solar, activity, only, accounted, for, 55, of, the, observed, trend, variance, numerical, climate, modelling, indicates, that, volcanic, activity, was, the, greater, driver, of, the, overall, lower, temperatures, in, the, lia, as, seen, in, a, variety, of, paleoclimate, proxies, in, a, 2012, paper, miller, et, al, link, the, little, ice, age, to, an, unusual, 50, year, long, episode, with, four, large, sulfur, rich, explosive, eruptions, each, with, global, sulfate, loading, 60, tg, and, notes, that, large, changes, in, solar, irradiance, are, not, required, throughout, the, lia, there, was, heightened, volcanic, activity, when, a, volcano, erupts, its, ash, reaches, high, into, the, atmosphere, and, can, spread, to, cover, the, whole, earth, the, ash, cloud, blocks, out, some, of, the, incoming, solar, radiation, which, leads, to, worldwide, cooling, for, up, to, two, years, after, an, eruption, also, emitted, by, eruptions, is, sulfur, in, the, form, of, sulfur, dioxide, when, sulfur, dioxide, reaches, the, stratosphere, the, gas, turns, into, sulfuric, acid, particles, which, reflect, the, sun, s, rays, that, further, reduces, the, amount, of, radiation, reaching, the, earth, s, surface, a, recent, study, found, that, an, especially, severe, tropical, volcanic, eruption, in, 1257, possibly, mount, samalas, pre, caldera, edifice, of, the, active, rinjani, near, mount, rinjani, both, in, lombok, indonesia, followed, by, three, smaller, eruptions, in, 1268, 1275, and, 1284, did, not, allow, the, climate, to, recover, that, may, have, caused, the, initial, cooling, and, the, 1452, 1453, mystery, eruption, triggered, a, second, pulse, of, cooling, the, cold, summers, can, be, maintained, by, sea, ice, ocean, feedbacks, long, after, volcanic, aerosols, are, removed, other, volcanoes, that, erupted, during, the, era, and, may, have, contributed, to, the, cooling, include, billy, mitchell, c, 1580, huaynaputina, 1600, mount, parker, 1641, long, island, papua, new, guinea, ca, 1660, and, laki, 1783, the, 1815, eruption, of, tambora, also, in, indonesia, blanketed, the, atmosphere, with, ash, and, the, following, year, came, to, be, known, as, the, year, without, a, summer, when, frost, and, snow, were, reported, in, june, and, july, in, both, new, england, and, northern, europe, in, the, early, 2000s, a, slowing, of, thermohaline, circulation, was, proposed, as, an, explanation, for, the, lia, specifically, through, the, weakening, of, the, north, atlantic, gyre, the, circulation, could, have, been, interrupted, by, the, introduction, of, a, large, amount, of, fresh, water, into, the, north, atlantic, and, might, have, been, caused, by, a, period, of, warming, before, the, lia, that, is, known, as, the, medieval, warm, period, some, researchers, have, thus, classified, the, lia, as, a, bond, event, in, 2005, there, was, some, concern, that, a, shutdown, of, thermohaline, circulation, could, happen, again, as, a, result, of, the, present, warming, more, recent, research, indicates, that, the, overall, atlantic, meridional, overturning, circulation, may, already, be, weaker, now, than, it, was, during, the, lia, or, perhaps, even, over, the, past, millennium, while, there, is, still, a, robust, debate, about, the, present, day, amoc, strength, these, findings, make, the, link, between, amoc, and, the, lia, unlikely, however, some, research, instead, suggests, that, a, far, more, localized, disruption, of, the, north, subpolar, gyre, convection, was, involved, in, the, lia, this, is, potentially, relevant, for, the, near, future, as, a, minority, of, climate, models, project, a, permanent, collapse, of, this, convection, under, some, scenarios, of, future, climate, change, some, researchers, have, proposed, that, human, influences, on, climate, began, earlier, than, is, normally, supposed, see, early, anthropocene, for, more, details, and, that, major, population, declines, in, eurasia, and, the, americas, reduced, that, impact, and, led, to, a, cooling, trend, the, black, death, is, estimated, to, have, killed, 30, to, 60, of, the, european, population, in, total, the, plague, may, have, reduced, the, world, population, from, an, estimated, 475, million, to, 350, 375, million, in, the, 14th, century, it, took, 200, years, for, the, world, population, to, recover, to, its, previous, level, william, ruddiman, et, al, proposed, that, those, large, population, reductions, in, europe, east, asia, and, the, middle, east, caused, a, decrease, in, agricultural, activity, that, allowed, reforestation, to, cause, additional, carbon, dioxide, uptake, from, the, atmosphere, leading, to, lia, cooling, a, 2011, study, by, the, carnegie, institution, s, department, of, global, ecology, asserts, that, the, mongol, invasions, and, conquests, which, lasted, almost, two, centuries, contributed, to, global, cooling, by, depopulating, vast, regions, and, replacing, cultivated, land, by, carbon, absorbing, forest, william, ruddiman, further, hypothesized, that, a, reduced, population, in, the, americas, after, european, contact, started, in, the, 16th, century, could, have, had, a, similar, effect, in, a, similar, vein, koch, and, others, in, 1990, suggested, that, as, european, conquest, and, disease, brought, by, europeans, killed, as, many, as, 90, of, indigenous, americans, around, 50, million, hectares, of, land, may, have, returned, to, a, wilderness, state, causing, increased, carbon, dioxide, uptake, other, researchers, have, supported, depopulation, in, the, americas, as, a, factor, and, have, asserted, that, humans, cleared, considerable, amounts, of, forest, to, support, agriculture, there, before, the, arrival, of, europeans, brought, on, a, population, collapse, richard, nevle, robert, dull, and, colleagues, further, suggested, not, only, that, anthropogenic, forest, clearance, played, a, role, in, reducing, the, amount, of, carbon, sequestered, in, neotropical, forests, but, also, that, human, set, fires, played, a, central, role, in, reducing, biomass, in, amazonian, and, central, american, forests, before, the, arrival, of, the, europeans, and, the, concomitant, spread, of, diseases, during, the, columbian, exchange, dull, and, nevle, calculated, that, reforestation, in, the, tropical, biomes, of, the, americas, alone, from, 1500, to, 1650, accounted, for, net, carbon, sequestration, of, 2, 5, pg, brierley, conjectured, that, the, european, arrival, in, the, americas, caused, mass, deaths, from, epidemic, disease, which, caused, much, abandonment, of, farmland, that, caused, much, forest, to, return, which, sequestered, more, co, 2, a, study, of, sediment, cores, and, soil, samples, further, suggests, that, co, 2, uptake, via, reforestation, in, the, americas, could, have, contributed, to, the, lia, the, depopulation, is, linked, to, a, drop, in, co, 2, levels, observed, at, law, dome, antarctica, it, is, suggested, that, during, the, little, ice, age, increased, deforestation, had, enough, effect, on, the, earth, s, albedo, reflectiveness, to, cause, regional, and, global, temperature, decreases, changes, in, albedo, were, caused, by, widespread, deforestation, at, high, latitudes, which, exposed, more, snow, cover, and, thus, increased, reflectiveness, of, the, earth, s, surface, as, land, was, cleared, for, agricultural, use, the, theory, implies, that, over, the, course, of, the, little, ice, age, enough, land, was, cleared, to, make, deforestation, a, possible, cause, of, climate, change, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, land, use, intensification, theory, could, explain, this, effect, the, theory, was, originally, proposed, by, ester, boserup, and, suggests, that, agriculture, advances, only, as, the, population, demands, it, furthermore, there, is, evidence, of, rapid, population, and, agricultural, expansion, which, could, warrant, some, of, the, changes, observed, in, the, climate, during, this, period, this, theory, is, still, under, speculation, for, multiple, reasons, primarily, the, difficulty, of, recreating, climate, simulations, outside, of, a, narrow, set, of, land, in, those, regions, so, that, one, cannot, rely, on, data, to, explain, sweeping, changes, or, to, account, for, the, wide, variety, of, other, sources, of, climate, change, globally, as, an, extension, of, the, first, reason, climate, models, including, this, period, have, shown, increases, and, decreases, in, temperature, globally, that, is, climate, models, have, shown, deforestation, as, neither, a, singular, cause, for, climate, change, nor, a, reliable, cause, for, the, global, temperature, decrease, spontaneous, fluctuations, in, global, climate, might, explain, the, past, variability, it, is, very, difficult, to, know, what, the, true, level, of, variability, from, internal, causes, might, be, given, the, existence, of, other, forces, as, noted, above, whose, magnitude, may, not, be, known, one, approach, to, evaluating, internal, variability, is, the, use, of, long, integrations, of, coupled, ocean, atmosphere, global, climate, models, they, have, the, advantage, that, the, external, forcing, is, known, to, be, zero, but, the, disadvantage, is, that, they, may, not, fully, reflect, reality, the, variations, may, result, from, chaos, driven, changes, in, the, oceans, the, atmosphere, or, interactions, between, the, two, two, studies, have, concluded, that, the, demonstrated, inherent, variability, was, not, great, enough, to, account, for, the, little, ice, age, the, severe, winters, of, 1770, to, 1772, in, europe, however, have, been, attributed, to, an, anomaly, in, the, north, atlantic, oscillation
