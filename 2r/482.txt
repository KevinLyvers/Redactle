independence, agreement, spanish, empire, the, mexican, war, of, independence, spanish, guerra, de, independencia, de, m, xico, 16, september, 1810, 27, september, 1821, was, an, armed, conflict, and, political, process, resulting, in, mexico, s, independence, from, the, spanish, empire, it, was, not, a, single, coherent, event, but, local, and, regional, struggles, that, occurred, within, the, same, period, and, can, be, considered, a, revolutionary, civil, war, it, culminated, with, the, drafting, of, the, declaration, of, independence, of, the, mexican, empire, in, mexico, city, on, september, 28, 1821, following, the, collapse, of, royal, government, and, the, military, triumph, of, forces, for, independence, mexican, independence, from, spain, was, not, an, inevitable, outcome, of, the, relationship, between, the, spanish, empire, and, its, most, valuable, overseas, possession, but, events, in, spain, had, a, direct, impact, on, the, outbreak, of, the, armed, insurgency, in, 1810, and, the, course, of, warfare, through, the, end, of, the, conflict, napoleon, bonaparte, s, invasion, of, spain, in, 1808, touched, off, a, crisis, of, legitimacy, of, crown, rule, since, he, had, placed, his, brother, joseph, on, the, spanish, throne, after, forcing, the, abdication, of, the, spanish, monarch, charles, iv, in, spain, and, many, of, its, overseas, possessions, the, local, response, was, to, set, up, juntas, ruling, in, the, name, of, the, bourbon, monarchy, delegates, in, spain, and, overseas, territories, met, in, c, diz, a, small, corner, of, the, iberian, peninsula, still, under, spanish, control, as, the, cortes, of, c, diz, and, drafted, the, spanish, constitution, of, 1812, that, constitution, sought, to, create, a, new, governing, framework, in, the, absence, of, the, legitimate, spanish, monarch, it, tried, to, accommodate, the, aspirations, of, american, born, spaniards, criollos, for, more, local, control, and, equal, standing, with, peninsular, born, spaniards, known, locally, as, peninsulares, this, political, process, had, far, reaching, impacts, in, new, spain, during, the, independence, war, and, beyond, pre, existing, cultural, religious, and, racial, divides, in, mexico, played, a, major, role, in, not, only, the, development, of, the, independence, movement, but, also, the, development, of, the, conflict, as, it, progressed, the, conflict, had, several, phases, the, first, uprising, for, independence, was, led, by, parish, priest, miguel, hidalgo, y, costilla, who, issued, the, cry, of, dolores, on, 16, september, 1810, the, revolt, was, massive, and, not, well, organized, hidalgo, was, captured, by, royalist, forces, defrocked, from, the, priesthood, and, executed, in, july, 1811, the, second, phase, of, the, insurgency, was, led, by, father, jos, mar, a, morelos, who, was, captured, by, royalist, forces, and, executed, in, 1815, the, insurgency, devolved, into, guerrilla, warfare, with, vicente, guerrero, emerging, as, a, leader, neither, royalists, nor, insurgents, gained, the, upper, hand, with, military, stalemate, continuing, until, 1821, when, former, royalist, commander, agust, n, de, iturbide, made, an, alliance, with, guerrero, under, the, plan, of, iguala, in, 1821, they, formed, a, unified, military, force, rapidly, bringing, about, the, collapse, of, royal, government, and, the, establishment, of, independent, mexico, the, unexpected, turn, of, events, in, mexico, was, prompted, by, events, in, spain, when, spanish, liberals, overthrew, the, autocratic, rule, of, ferdinand, vii, in, 1820, conservatives, in, new, spain, saw, political, independence, as, a, way, to, maintain, their, position, the, unified, military, force, entered, mexico, city, in, triumph, in, september, 1821, and, the, spanish, viceroy, juan, o, donoj, signed, the, treaty, of, c, rdoba, ending, spanish, rule, following, independence, the, mainland, of, new, spain, was, organized, as, the, first, mexican, empire, led, by, agust, n, de, iturbide, this, ephemeral, constitutional, monarchy, was, overthrown, and, a, federal, republic, was, declared, in, 1823, and, codified, in, the, constitution, of, 1824, after, some, spanish, reconquest, attempts, including, the, expedition, of, isidro, barradas, in, 1829, spain, under, the, rule, of, isabella, ii, recognized, the, independence, of, mexico, in, 1836, there, is, evidence, that, even, from, an, early, period, in, post, conquest, mexican, history, some, began, articulating, the, idea, of, a, separate, mexican, identity, though, at, the, time, this, would, have, occurred, only, among, elite, creole, circles, despite, these, murmurings, of, independence, serious, challenges, to, spanish, imperial, power, before, 1810, were, rare, and, relatively, isolated, one, early, challenge, to, crown, authority, came, after, the, introduction, of, the, new, laws, in, 1542, by, charles, v, holy, roman, emperor, under, these, laws, the, grants, of, the, encomenderos, were, to, be, ended, following, the, deaths, of, the, current, grant, holders, the, encomenderos, conspiracy, included, don, mart, n, cort, s, son, of, hern, n, cort, s, who, was, exiled, with, other, conspirators, executed, another, challenge, to, crown, authority, occurred, in, 1624, when, elites, ousted, the, reformist, viceroy, diego, carrillo, de, mendoza, 1st, marquess, of, gelves, who, sought, to, break, up, crime, rackets, from, which, the, elites, profited, and, curtail, opulent, displays, of, clerical, power, the, viceroy, was, removed, following, an, urban, religious, riot, of, mexico, city, commoners, in, 1624, stirred, up, by, the, elites, the, crowd, which, was, mostly, catholic, was, reported, to, have, shouted, long, live, the, king, long, live, christ, death, to, bad, government, death, to, the, heretic, lutheran, arrest, the, viceroy, the, attack, was, specifically, against, gelves, seen, as, a, bad, representative, of, the, crown, rather, than, against, the, monarchy, or, colonial, rule, itself, in, 1642, there, was, a, brief, conspiracy, to, unite, american, born, spaniards, blacks, indians, and, castas, against, the, spanish, crown, and, proclaim, mexican, independence, the, man, seeking, to, bring, about, independendence, called, himself, don, guill, n, lampart, y, guzm, n, an, irishman, with, the, birthname, william, lamport, lamport, s, conspiracy, was, discovered, and, he, was, arrested, by, the, inquisition, in, 1642, and, executed, fifteen, years, later, for, sedition, today, there, is, a, statue, of, lamport, in, the, mausoleum, at, the, base, of, the, angel, of, independence, in, mexico, city, in, 1692, there, was, a, major, riot, in, mexico, city, where, a, plebeian, mob, attempted, to, burn, down, the, viceroy, s, palace, and, the, archbishop, s, residence, a, painting, by, crist, bal, de, villalpando, shows, the, damage, of, the, tumulto, unlike, the, riot, in, 1624, in, which, elites, were, involved, and, the, viceroy, ousted, with, no, repercussions, against, the, instigators, the, 1692, riot, was, instigated, by, plebeians, alone, and, had, an, additional, racial, component, the, rioters, attacked, key, symbols, of, spanish, power, and, shouted, political, slogans, such, as, kill, the, spaniards, and, the, gachupines, who, eat, our, corn, we, go, to, war, happily, god, wants, us, to, finish, off, the, spaniards, we, do, not, care, if, we, die, without, confession, is, this, not, our, land, the, viceroy, attempted, to, address, the, cause, of, the, riot, a, hike, in, maize, prices, that, affected, the, urban, poor, but, the, 1692, riot, represented, class, warfare, that, put, spanish, authority, at, risk, punishment, was, swift, and, brutal, and, no, further, riots, in, the, capital, challenged, the, pax, hispanica, food, shortages, almost, a, century, later, due, to, a, growing, population, and, severe, droughts, led, to, two, food, riots, in, 1785, and, 1808, the, first, riot, was, more, severe, but, both, culminated, in, violence, and, anger, at, officials, of, the, colonial, regime, however, there, is, no, direct, link, between, these, riots, and, the, independence, movement, of, 1810, although, the, 1808, 1809, food, shortage, may, have, been, a, contributory, factor, for, popular, resentment, at, the, political, regime, various, indigenous, rebellions, in, the, colonial, era, occurred, but, were, generally, local, in, nature, attempting, to, redress, perceived, wrongs, of, immediate, authorities, rather, than, throw, off, crown, rule, more, broadly, they, were, not, a, broad, independence, movement, as, such, however, during, the, war, of, independence, issues, at, the, local, level, in, these, rural, areas, were, so, widespread, as, to, constitute, what, some, historians, have, called, the, other, rebellion, finally, before, the, events, of, 1808, upended, the, political, situation, in, new, spain, there, was, an, isolated, and, abortive, 1799, event, called, the, conspiracy, of, the, machetes, perpetrated, by, a, small, group, in, mexico, city, seeking, independence, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, age, of, revolution, was, already, underway, when, the, 1808, napoleonic, invasion, of, the, iberian, peninsula, destabilized, not, only, spain, but, also, spain, s, overseas, possessions, in, 1776, the, anglo, american, thirteen, colonies, and, the, american, revolution, successfully, gained, their, independence, in, 1783, with, the, help, of, both, the, spanish, empire, and, louis, xvi, s, french, monarchy, louis, xvi, was, toppled, in, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, with, the, aristocrats, and, the, king, himself, losing, his, head, in, revolutionary, violence, the, rise, of, military, strongman, napoleon, bonaparte, brought, some, order, within, france, but, the, turmoil, there, set, the, stage, for, the, black, slave, revolt, in, the, french, sugar, colony, of, saint, domingue, haiti, in, 1791, the, haitian, revolution, obliterated, the, slavocracy, and, gained, independence, for, haiti, in, 1804, tensions, in, new, spain, were, growing, after, the, mid, eighteenth, century, bourbon, reforms, with, the, reforms, the, crown, sought, to, increase, the, power, of, the, spanish, state, decrease, the, power, of, the, catholic, church, rationalize, and, tighten, control, over, the, royal, bureaucracy, by, placing, peninsular, born, officials, rather, than, american, born, and, increase, revenues, to, the, crown, by, a, series, of, measures, that, undermined, the, economic, position, of, american, born, elites, the, reforms, were, an, attempt, to, revive, the, political, and, economic, fortunes, of, the, spanish, empire, but, many, historians, see, the, reforms, as, accelerating, the, breakdown, of, its, unity, this, involved, often, removing, large, quantities, of, wealth, that, had, been, obtained, in, mexico, before, exporting, to, other, parts, of, the, empire, to, fund, the, many, wars, the, spanish, were, fighting, the, crown, removed, privileges, fuero, eclesi, stico, from, ecclesiastics, that, had, a, disproportionate, impact, on, american, born, priests, who, filled, the, ranks, of, the, lower, clergy, in, new, spain, a, number, of, parish, priests, most, famously, miguel, hidalgo, and, jos, mar, a, morelos, subsequently, became, involved, in, the, insurgency, for, independence, when, the, crown, expelled, the, jesuits, from, spain, and, the, overseas, empire, in, 1767, it, had, a, major, impact, on, elites, in, new, spain, whose, jesuit, sons, were, sent, into, exile, and, cultural, institutions, especially, universities, and, colleges, where, they, taught, were, affected, in, new, spain, there, were, riots, in, protest, of, their, expulsion, colonial, rule, was, not, based, on, outright, coercion, until, the, early, nineteenth, century, since, the, crown, did, not, have, sufficient, personnel, and, firepower, to, enforce, its, rule, rather, the, crown, s, hegemony, and, legitimacy, to, rule, was, accepted, and, ruled, through, institutions, acting, as, mediators, between, competing, groups, many, organized, as, corporate, entities, these, were, ecclesiastics, mining, entrepreneurs, elite, merchants, as, well, as, indigenous, communities, the, crown, s, creation, of, a, standing, military, in, the, 1780s, began, to, shift, the, political, calculus, since, the, crown, could, now, use, an, armed, force, to, impose, rule, to, aid, building, a, standing, military, the, crown, created, set, of, corporate, privileges, fuero, for, the, military, for, the, first, time, mixed, race, castas, and, blacks, had, access, to, corporate, privileges, usually, reserved, for, white, elites, silver, entrepreneurs, and, large, scale, merchants, also, had, access, to, special, privileges, lucrative, overseas, trade, was, in, the, hands, of, family, firms, based, in, spain, with, ties, to, new, spain, silver, mining, was, the, motor, of, the, economy, of, new, spain, but, also, fueled, the, economies, of, spain, and, the, entire, atlantic, world, that, industry, was, in, the, hands, of, peninsula, born, mine, owners, and, their, elite, merchant, investors, the, crown, imposed, new, regulations, to, boost, their, revenues, from, their, overseas, territories, particularly, the, consolidation, of, loans, held, by, the, catholic, church, the, 1804, act, of, consolidation, called, for, borrowers, to, immediately, repay, the, entire, principal, of, the, loan, rather, than, stretch, payments, over, decades, borrowers, were, criollo, land, owners, who, could, in, no, way, repay, large, loans, on, short, notice, the, impact, threatened, the, financial, stability, of, elite, americans, the, crown, s, forced, extraction, of, funds, is, considered, by, some, a, key, factor, in, creoles, considering, political, independence, within, the, spanish, empire, there, was, an, unofficial, yet, apparent, racial, hierarchy, which, affected, the, social, mobility, of, those, not, at, the, top, of, society, white, spanish, born, peninsulares, were, at, the, top, where, many, occupied, the, highest, levels, of, government, this, was, followed, by, mexican, born, pure, spanish, descendants, who, also, occupied, most, government, positions, and, creoles, below, this, were, indigenous, groups, african, mexicans, and, mixed, race, mexicans, many, creole, elites, deeply, resented, the, lack, of, social, mobility, this, brought, as, only, peninsular, born, spaniards, could, occupy, the, highest, levels, of, government, this, contributed, to, their, reasoning, behind, backing, the, move, for, independence, to, achieve, power, they, did, not, wish, to, overthrow, the, status, quo, entirely, as, this, would, threaten, their, lucrative, position, in, mexican, society, instead, they, wished, to, move, up, the, social, ladder, unable, to, under, the, unspoken, racial, hierarchy, of, the, regime, religious, tension, is, arguably, one, of, the, biggest, contributions, to, tension, before, the, french, invasion, of, spain, in, 1808, many, creoles, mexican, spaniards, and, the, majority, of, indigenous, mixed, and, african, groups, in, mexico, practiced, mexican, catholicism, while, the, ruling, peninsulares, preferred, modern, catholicism, mexican, or, traditional, catholicism, often, worshiped, through, the, use, of, relics, symbols, and, artifacts, where, they, believe, the, holy, spirit, existed, in, the, physical, form, of, the, artifact, and, was, a, mix, of, traditional, indigenous, forms, of, worship, and, catholicism, this, contrasted, with, the, view, of, modern, catholicism, that, many, peninsulares, shared, where, god, was, worshiped, through, divine, artifacts, and, relics, but, there, was, no, religious, presence, within, the, physical, artifact, laws, prohibiting, lay, preachers, a, major, part, of, mexican, catholicism, from, preaching, and, restrictions, on, villagers, to, engage, in, processions, around, communal, land, to, protect, from, unwanted, spirits, caused, much, outcry, and, prompted, a, multitude, of, legal, battles, between, indigenous, groups, and, the, colonial, regime, through, the, separate, indigenous, courts, not, only, this, but, new, laws, essentially, forcing, indigenous, groups, to, learn, spanish, in, schools, and, the, taxation, of, cofradias, or, confraternities, negatively, affected, the, literacy, and, living, standards, in, villages, the, ruling, white, spanish, elite, and, the, majority, of, the, country, had, very, different, views, not, only, in, culture, and, religion, but, on, the, role, of, government, and, social, relations, with, many, elites, viewing, the, government, as, a, tool, for, progressing, their, own, power, while, indigenous, groups, saw, the, government, as, a, communal, vessel, leading, up, to, the, crisis, in, 1808, both, creole, and, mexican, born, spaniards, and, indigenous, and, mixed, groups, had, come, to, dislike, the, colonial, regime, for, different, reasons, the, napoleonic, invasion, of, the, iberian, peninsula, destabilized, not, only, spain, but, also, spain, s, overseas, possessions, the, viceroy, was, the, king, s, living, image, in, new, spain, in, 1808, viceroy, jos, de, iturrigaray, 1803, 1808, was, in, office, when, napoleon, s, forces, invaded, iberia, and, deposed, the, spanish, monarch, charles, iv, and, napoleon, s, brother, joseph, was, declared, the, monarch, this, turn, of, events, set, off, a, crisis, of, legitimacy, viceroy, iturrigaray, had, been, appointed, by, charles, iv, so, his, legitimacy, to, rule, was, not, in, doubt, in, mexico, city, the, city, council, ayuntamiento, a, stronghold, of, american, born, spaniards, began, promoting, ideas, of, autonomy, for, new, spain, and, declaring, new, spain, to, be, on, an, equal, basis, to, spain, their, proposal, would, have, created, a, legitimate, representative, and, autonomous, government, in, new, spain, but, not, necessarily, breaking, from, the, spanish, empire, opposition, to, that, proposal, came, from, conservative, elements, including, the, peninsular, born, judges, of, the, high, court, audiencia, who, voiced, peninsular, interests, iturrigaray, attempted, to, find, a, compromise, between, the, two, factions, but, failed, upon, hearing, the, news, of, the, napoleonic, invasion, some, elites, suspected, that, iturrigaray, intended, to, declare, the, viceroyalty, a, sovereign, state, and, perhaps, establish, himself, as, head, of, a, new, state, with, the, support, of, the, archbishop, francisco, javier, de, lizana, y, beaumont, landowner, gabriel, de, yermo, the, merchant, guild, of, mexico, city, consulado, and, other, members, of, elite, society, in, the, capital, yermo, led, a, coup, d, tat, against, the, viceroy, they, stormed, the, viceregal, palace, in, mexico, city, the, night, of, 15, september, 1808, deposing, the, viceroy, and, imprisoning, him, along, with, some, american, born, spanish, members, of, the, city, council, the, peninsular, rebels, installed, pedro, de, garibay, as, viceroy, since, he, was, not, a, crown, appointee, but, rather, the, leader, of, a, rebel, faction, creoles, viewed, him, as, an, illegitimate, representative, of, the, crown, the, event, radicalized, both, sides, for, creoles, it, was, clear, that, to, gain, power, they, needed, to, form, conspiracies, against, peninsular, rule, and, later, they, took, up, arms, to, achieve, their, goals, garibay, was, of, advanced, years, and, held, office, for, just, a, year, replaced, by, archbishop, lizana, y, beaumont, also, holding, office, for, about, a, year, there, was, a, precedent, for, the, archbishop, serving, as, viceroy, and, given, that, garibay, came, to, power, by, coup, the, archbishop, had, more, legitimacy, as, ruler, francisco, javier, venegas, was, appointed, viceroy, and, landed, in, veracruz, in, august, reaching, mexico, city, 14, september, 1810, the, next, day, hidalgo, issued, his, call, to, arms, in, dolores, immediately, after, the, mexico, city, coup, ousting, iturrigaray, juntas, in, spain, created, the, supreme, central, junta, of, spain, and, the, indies, on, 25, september, 1808, in, aranjuez, its, creation, was, a, major, step, in, the, political, development, in, the, spanish, empire, once, it, became, clear, that, there, needed, to, be, a, central, governing, body, rather, than, scattered, juntas, of, particular, regions, joseph, i, of, spain, had, invited, representatives, from, spanish, america, to, bayonne, france, for, a, constitutional, convention, to, discuss, their, status, in, the, new, political, order, it, was, a, shrewd, political, move, but, none, accepted, the, invitation, however, it, became, clear, to, the, supreme, central, junta, that, keeping, his, overseas, kingdoms, loyal, was, imperative, silver, from, new, spain, was, vital, for, funding, the, war, against, france, the, body, expanded, to, include, membership, from, spanish, america, with, the, explicit, recognition, that, they, were, kingdoms, in, their, own, right, and, not, colonies, of, spain, elections, were, set, to, send, delegates, to, spain, to, participate, in, the, supreme, central, junta, although, in, the, spanish, empire, there, was, not, an, ongoing, tradition, of, high, level, representative, government, found, in, britain, and, british, north, america, towns, in, spain, and, new, spain, had, elected, representative, ruling, bodies, the, cabildos, or, ayuntamientos, which, came, to, play, an, important, political, role, when, the, legitimate, spanish, monarch, was, ousted, in, 1808, the, successful, 1809, elections, in, mexico, city, for, delegates, to, be, sent, to, spain, had, some, precedents, miguel, hidalgo, y, costilla, is, now, considered, the, father, of, mexican, independence, his, uprising, on, 16, september, 1810, is, considered, the, spark, igniting, the, mexican, war, of, independence, he, inspired, tens, of, thousands, of, ordinary, men, to, follow, him, but, did, not, organize, them, into, a, disciplined, fighting, force, or, have, a, broad, military, strategy, but, he, did, want, to, destroy, the, old, order, fellow, insurgent, leader, and, second, in, command, ignacio, allende, said, of, hidalgo, neither, were, his, men, amenable, to, discipline, nor, was, hidalgo, interested, in, regulations, hidalgo, issued, a, few, important, decrees, in, the, later, stage, of, the, insurgency, but, did, not, articulate, a, coherent, set, of, goals, much, beyond, his, initial, call, to, arms, denouncing, bad, government, only, following, hidalgo, s, death, in, 1811, under, the, leadership, of, his, former, seminary, student, father, jos, mar, a, morelos, was, a, document, created, that, made, explicit, the, goals, of, the, insurgency, the, sentimientos, de, la, naci, n, sentiments, of, the, nation, 1813, one, clear, point, was, political, independence, from, spain, despite, its, having, only, a, vague, ideology, hidalgo, s, movement, demonstrated, the, massive, discontent, and, power, of, mexico, s, plebeians, as, an, existential, threat, to, the, imperial, regime, the, government, focused, its, resources, on, defeating, hidalgo, s, insurgents, militarily, and, in, tracking, down, and, publicly, executing, its, leadership, but, by, then, the, insurgency, had, spread, beyond, its, original, region, and, leadership, hidalgo, was, a, learned, priest, who, knew, multiple, languages, had, a, significant, library, and, was, friends, with, men, who, held, enlightenment, views, he, held, the, important, position, of, rector, of, the, seminary, of, san, nicol, s, but, had, run, afoul, of, the, inquisition, for, unorthodox, beliefs, and, speaking, against, the, monarchy, he, had, already, sired, two, daughters, with, josefa, quintana, following, the, death, of, his, brother, joaqu, n, in, 1803, hidalgo, who, was, having, money, problems, due, to, debts, on, landed, estates, he, owned, became, curate, of, the, poor, parish, of, dolores, he, became, member, of, a, group, of, well, educated, american, born, spaniards, in, quer, taro, they, met, under, the, guise, of, being, a, literary, society, supported, by, the, wife, of, crown, official, corregidor, miguel, dom, nguez, josefa, ort, z, de, dom, nguez, known, now, as, la, corregidora, instead, the, members, discussed, the, possibility, of, a, popular, rising, similar, to, one, that, already, had, recently, been, quashed, in, valladolid, now, morelia, in, 1809, in, the, name, of, ferdinand, vii, hidalgo, was, friends, with, ignacio, allende, a, captain, in, the, regiment, of, dragoons, in, new, spain, who, was, also, among, the, conspirators, the, conspiracy, of, quer, taro, began, forming, cells, in, other, spanish, cities, in, the, north, including, celaya, guanajuato, san, miguel, el, grande, now, named, after, allende, allende, had, served, in, a, royal, regiment, during, the, rule, of, jos, de, iturrigaray, who, was, overthrown, in, 1808, by, peninsular, spaniards, who, considered, him, too, sympathetic, to, the, grievances, of, american, born, spaniards, with, the, ouster, of, the, viceroy, allende, turned, against, the, new, regime, and, was, open, to, the, conspiracy, for, independence, hidalgo, joined, the, conspiracy, and, with, allende, vouching, for, him, rose, to, being, one, of, its, leaders, word, of, the, conspiracy, got, to, crown, officials, and, the, corregidor, dom, nguez, cracked, down, but, his, wife, josefa, was, able, to, warn, allende, who, then, alerted, hidalgo, at, this, point, there, was, no, firm, ideology, or, action, plan, but, the, tip, off, galvanized, hidalgo, to, action, on, sunday, 16, september, 1810, with, his, parishioners, gathered, for, mass, hidalgo, issued, his, call, to, arms, the, grito, de, dolores, it, is, unclear, what, hidalgo, actually, said, since, there, are, different, accounts, the, one, which, became, part, of, the, official, record, of, accusation, against, hidalgo, was, long, live, religion, long, live, our, most, holy, mother, of, guadalupe, long, live, fernando, vii, long, live, america, and, down, with, bad, government, from, a, small, gathering, at, the, dolores, church, others, joined, the, uprising, including, workers, on, local, landed, estates, prisoners, liberated, from, jail, and, a, few, members, of, a, royal, army, regiment, many, estate, workers, weapons, were, agricultural, tools, now, to, be, used, against, the, regime, some, were, mounted, and, acted, as, a, cavalry, under, the, direction, of, their, estate, foremen, others, were, poorly, armed, indians, with, bows, and, arrows, the, numbers, joining, the, revolt, rapidly, swelled, under, hidalgo, s, leadership, they, began, moving, beyond, the, village, of, dolores, despite, rising, tensions, following, the, events, of, 1808, the, royal, regime, was, largely, unprepared, for, the, suddenness, size, and, violence, of, the, movement, the, religious, character, of, the, movement, was, present, from, the, beginning, embodied, in, leadership, of, the, priest, hidalgo, the, movement, s, banner, with, image, of, the, virgin, of, guadalupe, seized, by, hidalgo, from, the, church, at, atotonilco, was, symbolically, important, the, dark, virgin, was, seen, as, a, protector, of, dark, skinned, mexicans, and, now, seen, as, well, as, a, liberator, many, men, in, hidalgo, s, forces, put, the, image, of, guadalupe, on, their, hats, supporters, of, the, imperial, regime, took, as, their, patron, the, virgin, of, remedios, so, that, religious, symbolism, was, used, by, both, insurgents, and, royalists, there, were, a, number, of, parish, priests, and, other, lower, clergy, in, the, insurgency, most, prominently, hidalgo, and, jos, mar, a, morelos, but, the, church, hierarchy, was, flatly, opposed, insurgents, were, excommunicated, by, the, clergy, and, clerics, preached, sermons, against, the, insurgency, they, were, not, organized, in, any, formal, fashion, more, of, a, mass, movement, than, an, army, hidalgo, inspired, his, followers, but, did, not, organize, or, train, them, as, a, fighting, force, nor, impose, order, and, discipline, on, them, a, few, militia, men, in, uniform, joined, hidalgo, s, movement, and, attempted, to, create, some, military, order, and, discipline, but, they, were, few, in, number, the, bulk, of, the, royal, army, remained, loyal, to, the, imperial, regime, but, hidalgo, s, rising, had, caught, them, unprepared, and, their, response, was, delayed, hidalgo, s, early, victories, gave, the, movement, momentum, but, the, lack, of, weapons, trained, soldiers, and, good, officers, meant, that, except, in, unusual, circumstances, the, rebels, could, not, field, armies, capable, of, fighting, conventional, battles, against, the, royalists, the, growing, insurgent, force, marched, through, towns, including, san, miguel, el, grande, and, celaya, where, they, met, little, resistance, and, gained, more, followers, when, they, reached, the, town, of, guanajuato, on, 28, september, they, found, spanish, forces, barricaded, inside, the, public, granary, alh, ndiga, de, granaditas, among, them, were, some, forced, royalists, creoles, who, had, served, and, sided, with, the, spanish, by, this, time, the, rebels, numbered, 30, 000, and, the, battle, was, horrific, they, killed, more, than, 500, european, and, american, spaniards, and, marched, on, toward, mexico, city, the, new, viceroy, quickly, organized, a, defense, sending, out, the, spanish, general, torcuato, trujillo, with, 1, 000, men, 400, horsemen, and, two, cannons, all, that, could, be, found, on, such, short, notice, the, crown, had, established, a, standing, military, in, the, late, eighteenth, century, granting, non, spaniards, who, served, the, fuero, militar, the, only, special, privileges, for, mixed, race, men, were, eligible, indians, were, excluded, from, the, military, royal, army, troops, of, the, professional, army, were, supplemented, by, local, militias, the, regime, was, determined, to, crush, the, uprising, and, attempted, to, stifle, malcontents, who, might, be, drawn, to, the, insurgency, ignacio, l, pez, ray, n, joined, hidalgo, s, forces, whilst, passing, near, maravat, o, michoacan, while, en, route, to, mexico, city, and, on, 30, october, hidalgo, s, army, encountered, spanish, military, resistance, at, the, battle, of, monte, de, las, cruces, as, the, hidalgo, and, his, forces, surrounded, mexico, city, a, group, of, 2, 500, royalist, women, joined, under, ana, iraeta, de, mier, to, create, and, distribute, pamphlets, based, on, their, loyalty, towards, spain, and, help, fellow, loyalist, families, hidalgo, s, forces, continued, to, fight, and, achieved, victory, when, the, cannons, were, captured, by, the, rebels, the, surviving, royalists, retreated, to, the, city, despite, apparently, having, the, advantage, hidalgo, retreated, against, the, counsel, of, allende, this, retreat, on, the, verge, of, apparent, victory, has, puzzled, historians, and, biographers, ever, since, they, generally, believe, that, hidalgo, wanted, to, spare, the, numerous, mexican, citizens, in, mexico, city, from, the, inevitable, sacking, and, plunder, that, would, have, ensued, his, retreat, is, considered, hidalgo, s, greatest, tactical, error, and, his, failure, to, act, was, the, beginning, of, his, downfall, hidalgo, moved, west, and, set, up, headquarters, in, guadalajara, where, one, of, the, worst, incidents, of, violence, against, spanish, civilians, occurred, a, month, of, massacres, from, 12, december, 1810, the, feast, of, the, virgin, of, guadalupe, to, 13, january, 1811, at, his, trial, following, his, capture, later, that, year, hidalgo, admitted, to, ordering, the, murders, none, were, given, a, trial, nor, was, there, any, reason, to, do, so, since, he, knew, perfectly, well, they, were, innocent, in, guadalajara, the, image, of, the, virgin, of, guadalupe, suddenly, disappeared, from, insurgents, hats, and, there, were, many, desertions, the, royalist, forces, led, by, f, lix, mar, a, calleja, del, rey, were, becoming, more, effective, against, disorganized, and, poorly, armed, of, hidalgo, defeating, them, at, a, bridge, on, the, calder, n, river, forcing, the, rebels, to, flee, north, towards, the, united, states, perhaps, hoping, they, would, attain, financial, and, military, support, they, were, intercepted, by, ignacio, elizondo, who, pretended, to, join, the, fleeing, insurgent, forces, hidalgo, and, his, remaining, soldiers, were, captured, in, the, state, of, coahuila, at, the, wells, of, baj, n, norias, de, baj, n, 26, 27, when, the, insurgents, adopted, the, tactics, of, guerrilla, warfare, and, operated, where, it, was, effective, such, as, in, the, hot, country, of, southern, mexico, they, were, able, to, undermine, the, royalist, army, around, guanajuato, regional, insurgent, leader, albino, garc, a, for, a, time, successfully, combined, insurgency, with, banditry, with, the, capture, of, hidalgo, and, the, creole, leadership, in, the, north, this, phase, of, the, insurgency, was, at, an, end, the, captured, rebel, leaders, were, found, guilty, of, treason, and, sentenced, to, death, except, for, mariano, abasolo, who, was, sent, to, spain, to, serve, a, life, sentence, in, prison, allende, jim, nez, and, aldama, were, executed, on, 26, june, 1811, shot, in, the, back, as, a, sign, of, dishonor, 27, hidalgo, as, a, priest, had, to, undergo, a, civil, trial, and, review, by, the, inquisition, he, was, eventually, stripped, of, his, priesthood, found, guilty, and, executed, on, 30, july, 1811, the, heads, of, hidalgo, allende, aldama, and, jim, nez, were, preserved, and, hung, from, the, four, corners, of, the, alh, ndiga, de, granaditas, of, guanajuato, as, a, grim, warning, to, those, who, dared, follow, in, their, footsteps, 27, warfare, in, the, northern, baj, o, region, waned, after, the, capture, and, execution, of, the, insurgency, s, creole, leadership, but, the, insurgency, had, already, spread, to, other, more, southern, regions, to, the, towns, of, zit, cuaro, cuautla, antequera, now, oaxaca, towns, where, a, new, leadership, had, emerged, priests, jos, mar, a, morelos, and, mariano, matamoros, as, well, as, vicente, guerrero, guadalupe, victoria, and, ignacio, l, pez, ray, n, carried, on, the, insurgency, on, a, different, basis, organizing, their, forces, using, guerrilla, tactics, and, importantly, for, the, insurgency, creating, organizations, and, creating, written, documents, that, articulated, the, insurgents, goals, following, the, execution, of, hidalgo, and, other, insurgents, leadership, of, the, remaining, insurgent, movement, initially, coalesced, under, ignacio, l, pez, ray, n, a, civilian, lawyer, and, businessman, he, had, been, stationed, in, saltillo, coahuila, with, 3, 500, men, and, 22, cannons, when, he, heard, of, the, capture, of, the, insurgent, leaders, he, fled, south, on, 26, march, 1811, to, continue, the, fight, he, subsequently, fought, the, spanish, in, the, battles, of, puerto, de, pi, ones, zacatecas, el, maguey, and, zit, cuaro, in, an, important, step, ray, n, organized, the, suprema, junta, gubernativa, de, am, rica, supreme, national, governing, junta, of, america, which, claimed, legitimacy, to, lead, the, insurgency, ray, n, articulated, elementos, constitucionales, which, states, that, sovereignty, arises, directly, from, the, people, resides, in, the, person, of, ferdinand, vii, and, is, exercised, by, the, suprema, junta, gubernativa, de, am, rica, the, supreme, junta, generated, a, flood, of, detailed, regulations, and, orders, on, the, ground, father, jos, mar, a, morelos, pursued, successful, military, engagements, accepting, the, authority, of, the, supreme, junta, after, winning, victories, and, taking, the, port, of, acapulco, then, the, towns, tixtla, iz, car, and, taxco, morelos, was, besieged, for, 72, days, by, royalist, troops, under, calleja, at, cuautla, the, junta, failed, to, send, aid, to, morelos, morelos, s, troops, held, out, and, broke, out, of, the, siege, going, on, to, take, antequera, now, oaxaca, the, relationship, between, morelos, and, the, junta, soured, with, morelos, complaining, your, disagreements, have, been, of, service, to, the, enemy, morelos, was, a, real, contrast, to, hidalgo, although, both, were, rebel, priests, both, had, sympathy, for, mexico, s, downtrodden, but, morelos, was, of, mixed, race, while, hidalgo, was, an, american, born, spaniard, so, morelos, experientially, understood, racial, discrimination, in, the, colonial, order, on, more, practical, grounds, morelos, built, an, organized, and, disciplined, military, force, while, hidalgo, s, followers, lacked, arms, training, or, discipline, an, effective, force, that, the, royal, army, took, seriously, potentially, morelos, could, have, taken, the, colony, s, second, largest, city, puebla, de, los, angeles, situated, halfway, between, the, port, of, veracruz, and, the, capital, mexico, city, to, avert, that, strategic, disaster, which, would, have, left, the, capital, cut, off, from, its, main, port, viceroy, venegas, transferred, calleja, from, the, baj, o, to, deal, with, morelos, s, forces, morelos, s, forces, moved, south, and, took, oaxaca, allowing, him, to, control, most, of, the, southern, region, during, this, period, the, insurgency, had, reason, for, optimism, and, formulated, documents, declaring, independence, and, articulating, a, vision, for, a, sovereign, mexico, morelos, was, not, ambitious, to, become, leader, of, the, insurgency, but, it, was, clear, that, he, was, recognized, by, insurgents, as, its, supreme, military, commander, he, moved, swiftly, and, decisively, stripping, ray, n, of, power, dissolving, the, supreme, junta, and, in, 1813, morelos, convened, the, congress, of, chilpancingo, also, known, as, the, congress, of, an, huac, the, congress, brought, together, representatives, of, the, insurgency, together, morelos, formulated, his, sentiments, of, the, nation, addressed, to, the, congress, in, point, 1, he, clearly, and, flatly, states, that, america, is, free, and, independent, of, spain, on, 6, november, of, that, year, the, congress, signed, the, first, official, document, of, independence, known, as, the, solemn, act, of, the, declaration, of, independence, of, northern, america, in, addition, to, declaring, independence, from, spain, the, morelos, called, for, the, establishment, of, catholicism, as, the, only, religion, but, with, certain, restrictions, the, abolition, of, slavery, and, racial, distinctions, between, and, of, all, other, nations, going, on, in, point, 5, to, say, sovereignty, springs, directly, from, the, people, his, second, point, makes, the, catholic, religion, the, only, one, permissible, and, that, catholic, dogma, shall, be, sustained, by, the, church, hierarchy, point, 4, the, importance, of, catholicism, is, further, emphasized, to, mandate, december, 12, the, feast, of, the, virgin, of, guadalupe, as, a, day, to, honor, her, a, provision, of, key, importance, to, dark, skinned, plebeians, point, 15, is, that, slavery, is, proscribed, forever, as, well, as, the, distinctions, of, caste, so, that, all, shall, be, equal, and, that, the, only, distinction, between, one, american, and, another, shall, be, that, between, vice, and, virtue, also, important, for, morelos, s, vision, of, the, new, nation, was, equality, before, the, law, point, 13, rather, than, maintaining, special, courts, and, privileges, fueros, to, particular, groups, such, as, churchmen, miners, merchants, and, the, military, the, congress, elected, morelos, as, the, head, of, the, executive, branch, of, government, as, well, as, supreme, commander, of, the, insurgency, coordinating, its, far, flung, components, the, formal, statement, by, the, congress, of, chilpancingo, the, solemn, act, of, the, declaration, of, independence, is, an, important, formal, document, in, mexican, history, since, it, declares, mexico, an, independent, nation, and, lays, out, its, powers, as, a, sovereign, state, to, make, war, and, peace, to, appoint, ambassadors, and, to, have, standing, with, the, papacy, rather, than, indirectly, through, the, spanish, monarch, the, document, enshrines, roman, catholicism, the, sole, religion, calleja, restructured, the, royal, army, in, an, attempt, to, crush, the, insurgency, creating, commands, in, puebla, valladolid, now, morelia, guanajuato, and, nueva, galicia, with, experienced, peninsular, military, officers, to, lead, them, american, born, officer, agust, n, de, iturbide, was, part, of, this, royalist, leadership, brigadier, ciriaco, de, llano, captured, and, executed, mariano, matamoros, an, effective, insurgent, after, the, dissolution, of, the, congress, of, chilpancingo, morelos, was, captured, 5, november, 1815, interrogated, was, tried, and, executed, by, firing, squad, with, his, death, conventional, warfare, ended, and, guerrilla, warfare, continued, uninterrupted, with, the, execution, of, morelos, in, 1815, vicente, guerrero, emerged, as, the, most, important, leader, of, the, insurgency, from, 1815, to, 1821, most, of, the, fighting, for, independence, from, spain, was, by, guerrilla, forces, in, the, tierra, caliente, hot, country, of, southern, mexico, and, to, a, certain, extent, in, northern, new, spain, in, 1816, francisco, javier, mina, a, spanish, military, leader, who, had, fought, against, ferdinand, vii, joined, the, independence, movement, mina, and, 300, men, landed, at, rio, santander, tamaulipas, in, april, in, 1817, and, fought, for, seven, months, until, his, capture, by, royalist, forces, in, november, 1817, 55, 58, two, insurgent, leaders, arose, guadalupe, victoria, born, jos, miguel, fern, ndez, y, f, lix, in, puebla, and, vicente, guerrero, in, the, village, of, tixla, in, what, is, now, the, state, of, guerrero, both, gained, allegiance, and, respect, from, their, followers, believing, the, situation, under, control, the, spanish, viceroy, issued, a, general, pardon, to, every, rebel, who, would, lay, down, his, arms, many, did, lay, down, their, arms, and, received, pardons, but, when, the, opportunity, arose, they, often, returned, to, the, insurgency, the, royal, army, controlled, the, major, cities, and, towns, but, whole, swaths, of, the, countryside, were, not, pacified, from, 1816, to, 1820, the, insurgency, was, stalemated, but, not, stamped, out, royalist, military, officer, antonio, l, pez, de, santa, anna, led, amnestied, former, insurgents, pursuing, insurgent, leader, guadalupe, victoria, insurgents, attacked, key, roads, vital, for, commerce, and, imperial, control, such, that, the, crown, sent, a, commander, from, peru, brigadier, fernando, miyares, y, mancebo, to, build, a, fortified, road, between, the, port, of, veracruz, and, jalapa, the, first, major, stopping, point, on, the, way, to, mexico, city, the, rebels, faced, stiff, spanish, military, resistance, and, the, apathy, of, many, of, the, most, influential, criollos, the, period, 1816, 1820, is, often, considered, a, period, of, military, stalemate, unable, to, delivery, a, knockout, blow, insurgents, often, settled, into, guerrilla, warfare, with, some, banditry, while, royalist, forces, became, increasingly, demoralized, spain, sent, insufficient, reinforcements, although, a, number, of, senior, officers, arrived, by, 1814, the, peninsular, war, against, napoleon, was, won, and, ferdinand, vii, became, the, monarch, initially, as, a, constitutional, ruler, under, the, spanish, constitution, of, 1812, but, once, in, power, reneged, on, promises, to, have, constitutional, limits, on, his, power, crown, resources, did, not, go, toward, funding, the, war, against, the, insurgents, so, that, many, expeditionary, soldiers, were, not, paid, and, left, to, their, own, devices, in, territory, largely, controlled, by, insurgents, rather, than, risk, life, and, limb, fighting, insurgents, they, avoided, risky, operations, and, stayed, close, to, fortified, garrisons, since, money, to, pay, and, supply, soldiers, was, not, forthcoming, from, the, crown, royal, forces, pressed, local, populations, for, supplies, as, for, high, officers, many, saw, the, hopelessness, of, the, situation, and, decided, to, make, the, best, of, it, by, creating, what, one, historian, has, called, veritable, satrapies, becoming, wealthy, from, confiscated, insurgent, properties, and, taxing, local, merchants, in, what, was, supposed, to, be, the, final, government, campaign, against, the, insurgents, in, december, 1820, viceroy, juan, ruiz, de, apodaca, sent, a, force, led, by, a, royalist, colonel, agust, n, de, iturbide, to, defeat, guerrero, s, army, in, oaxaca, iturbide, a, native, of, valladolid, now, morelia, had, gained, renown, for, his, zeal, against, hidalgo, s, and, morelos, s, rebels, during, the, early, independence, struggle, a, favorite, of, the, mexican, church, hierarchy, iturbide, symbolized, conservative, creole, values, he, was, devoutly, religious, and, committed, to, the, defense, of, property, rights, and, social, privileges, he, also, resented, his, lack, of, promotion, and, failure, to, gain, wealth, iturbide, s, assignment, to, the, oaxaca, expedition, in, 1820, coincided, with, a, successful, military, coup, in, spain, against, the, monarchy, of, ferdinand, vii, the, coup, leaders, part, of, an, expeditionary, force, assembled, to, suppress, the, independence, movements, in, the, americas, had, turned, against, the, autocratic, monarchy, they, compelled, the, reluctant, ferdinand, to, reinstate, the, liberal, spanish, constitution, of, 1812, that, created, a, constitutional, monarchy, when, news, of, the, liberal, charter, reached, new, spain, iturbide, perceived, it, both, as, a, threat, to, the, status, quo, and, a, catalyst, to, rouse, the, creole, elites, to, gain, control, of, mexico, independence, was, achieved, when, conservative, royalist, forces, in, the, colonies, chose, to, rise, up, against, the, liberal, regime, in, spain, it, was, an, about, face, compared, to, their, previous, opposition, to, the, peasant, insurgency, the, royalist, army, was, demoralized, and, the, insurgents, were, unable, to, oust, them, with, the, re, imposition, of, the, spanish, constitution, the, relationship, between, newly, elected, town, councils, ayuntamientos, and, the, military, meant, that, councils, could, put, limits, on, taxation, and, many, voted, to, cease, exacting, taxes, to, support, the, royalist, army, commanders, lost, their, financial, support, and, could, no, longer, compel, men, to, join, militias, militias, were, demobilized, and, men, who, had, served, outside, of, their, native, areas, went, home, the, insurgents, no, longer, felt, the, continuous, pressure, of, the, royalist, military, militia, men, abandoned, areas, where, insurgents, were, active, with, the, situation, changed, in, part, because, of, the, spanish, constitution, guerrero, realized, that, creole, elites, might, move, toward, independence, and, exclude, the, insurgents, for, that, reason, his, reaching, an, accommodation, with, the, royalist, army, became, a, pragmatic, move, from, the, royalist, point, of, view, forging, an, alliance, with, their, former, foes, created, a, way, forward, to, independence, if, creoles, had, declared, independence, for, their, own, political, purposes, without, coming, to, terms, with, the, insurgency, in, the, south, then, an, independent, mexico, would, have, to, contend, with, rebels, who, could, threaten, a, new, nation, iturbide, initiated, contact, with, guerrero, in, january, 1821, indicating, he, was, weighing, whether, to, abandon, the, royalist, cause, guerrero, was, receptive, to, listening, to, iturbide, s, vague, proposal, but, was, not, going, to, commit, without, further, clarification, iturbide, replied, to, guerrero, s, demand, for, clarity, saying, that, he, had, a, plan, for, a, constitution, one, apparently, based, on, the, 1812, spanish, liberal, constitution, guerrero, responded, that, the, failure, of, that, constitution, to, address, the, grievances, of, many, in, new, spain, and, particularly, objected, to, that, constitution, s, exclusion, of, afro, mexicans, from, citizenship, while, according, it, to, european, whites, indians, and, mestizos, the, question, of, equality, for, all, races, was, a, key, matter, for, guerrero, and, other, insurgents, many, of, whom, were, had, african, ancestry, iturbide, accepted, that, important, change, the, two, men, negotiated, about, how, the, merging, of, the, old, insurgent, forces, and, the, former, royalist, army, would, occur, iturbide, wrote, the, final, draft, of, the, plan, of, iguala, named, for, the, place, where, it, was, proclaimed, on, 24, february, 1821, iturbide, proclaimed, three, principles, or, guarantees, for, mexican, independence, from, spain, mexico, would, be, an, independent, monarchy, governed, by, king, ferdinand, another, bourbon, prince, or, some, other, conservative, european, prince, creoles, would, be, given, equal, rights, and, privileges, to, peninsulares, and, the, roman, catholic, church, in, mexico, would, retain, its, privileges, and, position, as, the, established, religion, of, the, land, to, reach, an, accord, that, both, sides, would, accept, the, plan, explicitly, laid, out, the, terms, of, equality, for, people, of, mixed, race, point, 12, made, explicit, all, inhabitants, of, new, spain, without, distinction, to, their, being, europeans, africans, or, indians, are, citizens, of, this, monarchy, with, the, option, to, seek, all, employment, according, to, their, merits, and, virtues, for, european, whites, their, privileged, place, in, mexico, was, to, be, maintained, guaranteeing, their, place, in, existing, positions, in, government, all, branches, of, the, government, service, will, remain, without, alteration, and, that, all, those, presently, employed, in, politics, the, church, civilian, business, or, the, military, will, retain, the, same, positions, held, at, present, racial, designations, of, mexicans, and, distinctions, between, creole, and, peninsular, spaniards, were, abolished, after, convincing, his, troops, to, accept, the, plan, of, iguala, iturbide, persuaded, guerrero, to, join, his, forces, in, support, of, this, conservative, independence, movement, a, new, army, the, army, of, the, three, guarantees, was, placed, under, iturbide, s, command, to, enforce, the, plan, the, plan, was, so, broadly, based, that, it, appealed, both, patriots, and, loyalists, the, goal, of, independence, and, the, protection, of, roman, catholicism, brought, together, most, factions, to, symbolize, these, three, guarantees, of, unity, religion, and, independence, iturbide, adopted, a, green, white, and, red, flag, these, colors, are, still, used, in, the, modern, mexican, flag, 71, although, the, alliance, of, iturbide, and, guerrero, resulted, in, the, plan, of, iguala, there, was, not, universal, acclaim, of, the, accord, a, number, of, important, insurgents, including, juan, lvarez, pedro, ascensio, and, gordiano, guzm, n, rejected, it, guzm, n, articulated, his, objection, to, the, plan,
