like, a, science, in, the, 20th, century, historians, incorporated, social, science, dimensions, like, politics, economy, and, culture, in, their, historiography, the, research, interests, of, historians, change, over, time, and, there, has, been, a, shift, away, from, traditional, diplomatic, economic, and, political, history, toward, newer, approaches, especially, social, and, cultural, studies, from, 1975, to, 1995, the, proportion, of, professors, of, history, in, american, universities, identifying, with, social, history, increased, from, 31, to, 41, percent, while, the,

scotland, from, 1681, the, scottish, post, is, still, in, existence, historiography, was, more, recently, defined, as, the, study, of, the, way, history, has, been, and, is, written, the, history, of, historical, writing, which, means, that, when, you, study, historiography, you, do, not, study, the, events, of, the, past, directly, but, the, changing, interpretations, of, those, events, in, the, works, of, individual, historians, understanding, the, past, appears, to, be, a, universal, human, need, and, the, telling, of, history, has, emerged, independently, in, civilizations, around, the, world, what, constitutes, history, is, a, philosophical, question, see, philosophy, of, history, the, earliest, chronologies, date, back, to, ancient, egypt, and, sumerian, akkadian, mesopotamia, in, the, form, of, chronicles, and, annals, however, most, historical, writers, in, these, early, civilizations, were, not, known, by, name, and, their, works, usually, did, not, contain, narrative, structures, or, detailed, analysis, by, contrast, the, term, historiography, is, taken, to, refer, to, written, history, recorded, in, a, narrative, format, for, the, purpose, of, informing, future, generations, about, events, in, this, limited, sense, ancient, history, begins, with, the, written, history, of, early, historiography, in, classical, antiquity, established, in, 5th, century, bc, classical, greece, the, earliest, known, systematic, historical, thought, and, methodologies, emerged, in, ancient, greece, and, the, wider, greek, world, a, development, which, would, be, an, important, influence, on, the, writing, of, history, elsewhere, around, the, mediterranean, region, the, tradition, of, logography, in, archaic, greece, preceded, the, full, narrative, form, of, historiography, in, which, logographers, such, as, hecataeus, of, miletus, provided, prose, compilations, about, places, in, geography, and, peoples, in, an, early, form, of, cultural, anthropology, as, well, as, speeches, used, in, courts, of, law, the, earliest, known, fully, narrative, critical, historical, works, were, the, histories, composed, by, herodotus, of, halicarnassus, 484, 425, bc, who, became, known, as, the, father, of, history, herodotus, attempted, to, distinguish, between, more, and, less, reliable, accounts, and, personally, conducted, research, by, travelling, extensively, giving, written, accounts, of, various, mediterranean, cultures, although, herodotus, overall, emphasis, lay, on, the, actions, and, characters, of, men, he, also, attributed, an, important, role, to, divinity, in, the, determination, of, historical, events, the, generation, following, herodotus, witnessed, a, spate, of, local, histories, of, the, individual, city, states, poleis, written, by, the, first, of, the, local, historians, who, employed, the, written, archives, of, city, and, sanctuary, dionysius, of, halicarnassus, characterized, these, historians, as, the, forerunners, of, thucydides, and, these, local, histories, continued, to, be, written, into, late, antiquity, as, long, as, the, city, states, survived, two, early, figures, stand, out, hippias, of, elis, who, produced, the, lists, of, winners, in, the, olympic, games, that, provided, the, basic, chronological, framework, as, long, as, the, pagan, classical, tradition, lasted, and, hellanicus, of, lesbos, who, compiled, more, than, two, dozen, histories, from, civic, records, all, of, them, now, lost, thucydides, largely, eliminated, divine, causality, in, his, account, of, the, war, between, athens, and, sparta, establishing, a, rationalistic, element, which, set, a, precedent, for, subsequent, western, historical, writings, he, was, also, the, first, to, distinguish, between, cause, and, immediate, origins, of, an, event, while, his, successor, xenophon, c, 431, 355, bc, introduced, autobiographical, elements, and, biographical, character, studies, in, his, anabasis, the, proverbial, philippic, attacks, of, the, athenian, orator, demosthenes, 384, 322, bc, on, philip, ii, of, macedon, marked, the, height, of, ancient, political, agitation, the, now, lost, history, of,

reports, exist, of, other, near, eastern, histories, such, as, that, of, the, phoenician, historian, sanchuniathon, but, he, is, considered, semi, legendary, and, writings, attributed, to, him, are, fragmentary, known, only, through, the, later, historians, philo, of, byblos, and, eusebius, who, asserted, that, he, wrote, before, even, the, trojan, war, the, native, egyptian, priest, and, historian, manetho, composed, a, history, of, egypt, in, greek, for, the, ptolemaic, royal, court, during, the, 3rd, century, bc, the, romans, adopted, the, greek, tradition, writing, at, first, in, greek, but, eventually, chronicling, their, history, in, a, freshly, non, greek, language, early, roman, works, were, still, written, in, greek, such, as, the, annals, of, quintus, fabius, pictor, however, the, origines, composed, by, the, roman, statesman, cato, the, elder, 234, 149, bc, was, written, in, latin, in, a, conscious, effort, to, counteract, greek, cultural, influence, it, marked, the, beginning, of, latin, historical, writings, hailed, for, its, lucid, style, julius, caesar, s, 103, 44, bc, de, bello, gallico, exemplifies, autobiographical, war, coverage, the, politician, and, orator, cicero, 106, 43, bc, introduced, rhetorical, elements, in, his, political, writings, strabo, 63, bc, c, 24, ad, was, an, important, exponent, of, the, greco, roman, tradition, of, combining, geography, with, history, presenting, a, descriptive, history, of, peoples, and, places, known, to, his, era, the, roman, historian, sallust, 86, 35, bc, sought, to, analyze, and, document, what, he, viewed, as, the, decline, of, the, republican, roman, state, and, its, virtues, highlighted, in, his, respective, narrative, accounts, of, the, catilinarian, conspiracy, and, the, jugurthine, war, livy, 59, bc, 17, ad, records, the, rise, of, rome, from, city, state, to, empire, his, speculation, about, what, would, have, happened, if, alexander, the, great, had, marched, against, rome, represents, the, first, known, instance, of, alternate, history, biography, although, popular, throughout, antiquity, was, introduced, as, a, branch, of, history, by, the, works, of, plutarch, c, 45, 125, ad, and, suetonius, c, 69, after, 130, ad, who, described, the, deeds, and, characters, of, ancient, personalities, stressing, their, human, side, tacitus, c, 56, c, 117, ad, denounces, roman, immorality, by, praising, german, virtues, elaborating, on, the, topos, of, the, noble, savage, tacitus, focus, on, personal, character, can, also, be, viewed, as, pioneering, work, in, psychohistory, although, rooted, in, greek, historiography, in, some, ways, roman, historiography, shared, traits, with, chinese, historiography, lacking, speculative, theories, and, instead, relying, on, annalistic, forms, revering, ancestors, and, imparting, moral, lessons, for, their, audiences, laying, the, groundwork, for, medieval, christian, historiography, the, han, dynasty, eunuch, sima, qian, 145, 86, bc, was, the, first, in, china, to, lay, the, groundwork, for, professional, historical, writing, his, work, superseded, the, older, style, of, the, spring, and, autumn, annals, compiled, in, the, 5th, century, bc, the, bamboo, annals, the, classic, of, history, and, other, court, and, dynastic, annals, that, recorded, history, in, a, chronological, form, that, abstained, from, analysis, and, focused, on, moralistic, teaching, in, 281, ad, the, tomb, of, king, xiang, of, wei, d, 296, bc, was, opened, inside, of, which, was, found, a, historical, text, called, the, bamboo, annals, after, the, writing, material, it, is, similar, in, style, to, the, spring, and, autumn, annals, and, covers, events, from, the, mythical, yellow, emperor, to, 299, bc, opinions, on, the, authenticity, of, the, text, has, varied, throughout, the, centuries, and, it, was, rediscovered, too, late, to, gain, the, same, status, as, the, spring, and, autumn, annals, sima, s, shiji, records, of, the, grand, historian, initiated, by, his, father, the, court, astronomer, sima, tan, 165, 110, bc, pioneered, the, annals, biography, format, which, would, become, the, standard, for, prestige, history, writing, in, china, in, this, genre, a, history, opens, with, a, chronological, outline, of, court, affairs, and, then, continues, with, detailed, biographies, of, prominent, people, who, lived, during, the, period, in, question, the, scope, of, his, work, extended, as, far, back, as, the, 16th, century, bc, with, the, founding, of, the, shang, dynasty, it, included, many, treatises, on, specific, subjects, and, individual, biographies, of, prominent, people, he, also, explored, the, lives, and, deeds, of, commoners, both, contemporary, and, those, of, previous, eras, whereas, sima, s, had, been, a, universal, history, from, the, beginning, of, time, down, to, the, time, of, writing, his, successor, ban, gu, wrote, an, annals, biography, history, limiting, its, coverage, to, only, the, western, han, dynasty, the, book, of, han, 96, ad, this, established, the, notion, of, using, dynastic, boundaries, as, start, and, end, points, and, most, later, chinese, histories, would, focus, on, a, single, dynasty, or, group, of, dynasties, the, records, of, the, grand, historian, and, book, of, han, were, eventually, joined, by, the, book, of, the, later, han, ad, 488, replacing, the, earlier, and, now, only, partially, extant, han, records, from, the, eastern, pavilion, and, the, records, of, the, three, kingdoms, ad, 297, to, form, the, four, histories, these, became, mandatory, reading, for, the, imperial, examinations, and, have, therefore, exerted, an, influence, on, chinese, culture, comparable, to, the, confucian, classics, more, annals, biography, histories, were, written, in, subsequent, dynasties, eventually, bringing, the, number, to, between, twenty, four, and, twenty, six, but, none, ever, reached, the, popularity, and, impact, of, the, first, four, traditional, chinese, historiography, describes, history, in, terms, of, dynastic, cycles, in, this, view, each, new, dynasty, is, founded, by, a, morally, righteous, founder, over, time, the, dynasty, becomes, morally, corrupt, and, dissolute, eventually, the, dynasty, becomes, so, weak, as, to, allow, its, replacement, by, a, new, dynasty, christian, historical, writing, arguably, begins, with, the, narrative, sections, of, the, new, testament, particularly, luke, acts, which, is, the, primary, source, for, the, apostolic, age, though, its, historical, reliability, is, disputed, the, first, tentative, beginnings, of, a, specifically, christian, historiography, can, be, seen, in, clement, of, alexandria, in, the, second, century, the, growth, of, christianity, and, its, enhanced, status, in, the, roman, empire, after, constantine, i, see, state, church, of, the, roman, empire, led, to, the, development, of, a, distinct, christian, historiography, influenced, by, both, christian, theology, and, the, nature, of, the, christian, bible, encompassing, new, areas, of, study, and, views, of, history, the, central, role, of, the, bible, in, christianity, is, reflected, in, the, preference, of, christian, historians, for, written, sources, compared, to, the, classical, historians, preference, for, oral, sources, and, is, also, reflected, in, the, inclusion, of, politically, unimportant, people, christian, historians, also, focused, on, development, of, religion, and, society, this, can, be, seen, in, the, extensive, inclusion, of, written, sources, in, the, ecclesiastical, history, of, eusebius, of, caesarea, around, 324, and, in, the, subjects, it, covers, christian, theology, considered, time, as, linear, progressing, according, to, divine, plan, as, god, s, plan, encompassed, everyone, christian, histories, in, this, period, had, a, universal, approach, for, example, christian, writers, often, included, summaries, of, important, historical, events, prior, to, the, period, covered, by, the, work, writing, history, was, popular, among, christian, monks, and, clergy, in, the, middle, ages, they, wrote, about, the, history, of, jesus, christ, that, of, the, church, and, that, of, their, patrons, the, dynastic, history, of, the, local, rulers, in, the, early, middle, ages, historical, writing, often, took, the, form, of, annals, or, chronicles, recording, events, year, by, year, but, this, style, tended, to, hamper, the, analysis, of, events, and, causes, an, example, of, this, type, of, writing, is, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, which, was, the, work, of, several, different, writers, it, was, started, during, the, reign, of, alfred, the, great, in, the, late, 9th, century, but, one, copy, was, still, being, updated, in, 1154, some, writers, in, the, period, did, construct, a, more, narrative, form, of, history, these, included, gregory, of, tours, and, more, successfully, bede, who, wrote, both, secular, and, ecclesiastical, history, and, who, is, known, for, writing, the, ecclesiastical, history, of, the, english, people, outside, of, europe, and, west, asia, christian, historiography, also, existed, in, africa, for, instance, augustine, of, hippo, the, berber, theologian, and, bishop, of, hippo, regius, in, numidia, roman, north, africa, wrote, a, multiple, volume, autobiography, called, confessions, between, 397, and, 400, ad, while, earlier, pagan, rulers, of, the, kingdom, of, aksum, produced, autobiographical, style, epigraphic, texts, in, locations, spanning, ethiopia, eritrea, and, sudan, and, in, either, greek, or, the, native, ge, ez, script, the, 4th, century, ad, ezana, stone, commemorating, ezana, of, axum, s, conquest, of, the, kingdom, of, kush, in, nubia, also, emphasized, his, conversion, to, christianity, the, first, indigenous, african, head, of, state, to, do, so, aksumite, manuscripts, from, the, 5th, to, 7th, centuries, ad, chronicling, the, dioceses, and, episcopal, sees, of, the, coptic, orthodox, church, demonstrate, not, only, an, adherence, to, christian, chronology, but, also, influences, from, the, non, christian, kingdom, of, kush, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, of, hellenistic, egypt, and, the, yemenite, jews, of, the, himyarite, kingdom, the, tradition, of, ethiopian, historiography, evolved, into, a, matured, form, during, the, solomonic, dynasty, though, works, such, as, the, 13th, century, kebra, nagast, blended, christian, mythology, with, historical, events, in, its, narrative, the, first, proper, biographical, chronicle, on, an, emperor, of, ethiopia, was, made, for, amda, seyon, i, r, 1314, 1344, depicted, as, a, christian, savior, of, his, nation, in, conflicts, with, the, islamic, ifat, sultanate, the, 16th, century, monk, bahrey, was, the, first, in, ethiopia, to, produce, a, historical, ethnography, focusing, on, the, migrating, oromo, people, who, came, into, military, conflict, with, the, ethiopian, empire, while, royal, biographies, existed, for, individual, ethiopian, emperors, authored, by, court, historians, who, were, also, clerical, scholars, within, the, ethiopian, orthodox, church, the, reigns, of, iyasu, ii, r, 1730, 1755, and, iyoas, i, r, 1755, 1769, were, the, first, to, be, included, in, larger, general, dynastic, histories, during, the, renaissance, history, was, written, about, states, or, nations, the, study, of, history, changed, during, the, enlightenment, and, romanticism, voltaire, described, the, history, of, certain, ages, that, he, considered, important, rather, than, describing, events, in, chronological, order, history, became, an, independent, discipline, it, was, not, called, philosophia, historiae, anymore, but, merely, history, historia, muslim, historical, writings, first, began, to, develop, in, the, 7th, century, with, the, reconstruction, of, the, prophet, muhammad, s, life, in, the, centuries, following, his, death, with, numerous, conflicting, narratives, regarding, muhammad, and, his, companions, from, various, sources, it, was, necessary, to, verify, which, sources, were, more, reliable, in, order, to, evaluate, these, sources, various, methodologies, were, developed, such, as, the, science, of, biography, science, of, hadith, and, isnad, chain, of, transmission, these, methodologies, were, later, applied, to, other, historical, figures, in, the, islamic, civilization, famous, historians, in, this, tradition, include, urwah, d, 712, wahb, ibn, munabbih, d, 728, ibn, ishaq, d, 761, al, waqidi,

historical, writing, eventually, culminated, in, the, works, of, the, arab, muslim, historian, ibn, khaldun, 1332, 1406, who, published, his, historiographical, studies, in, the, muqaddimah, translated, as, prolegomena, and, kitab, al, i, bar, book, of, advice, his, work, was, forgotten, until, it, was, rediscovered, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, earliest, works, of, history, produced, in, japan, were, the, rikkokushi, six, national, histories, a, corpus, of, six, national, histories, covering, the, history, of, japan, from, its, mythological, beginnings, until, the, 9th, century, the, first, of, these, works, were, the, nihon, shoki, compiled, by, prince, toneri, in, 720, the, tradition, of, korean, historiography, was, established, with, the, samguk, sagi, a,

century, the, latter, work, is, now, lost, the, shitong, published, around, 710, by, the, tang, chinese, historian, liu, zhiji, 661, 721, was, the, first, work, to, provide, an, outline, of, the, entire, tradition, of, chinese, historiography, up, to, that, point, and, the, first, comprehensive, work, on, historical, criticism, arguing, that, historians, should, be, skeptical, of, primary, sources, rely, on, systematically, gathered, evidence, and, should, not, treat, previous, scholars, with, undue, deference, in, 1084, the, song, dynasty, official, sima, guang, completed, the, zizhi, tongjian, comprehensive, mirror, to, aid, in, government, which, laid, out, the, entire, history, of, china, from, the, beginning, of, the, warring, states, period, 403, bc, to, the, end, of, the, five, dynasties, period, 959, in, chronological, annals, form, rather, than, in, the, traditional, annals, biography, form, this, work, is, considered, much, more, accessible, than, the, official, histories, for, the, six, dynasties, tang, dynasty, and, five, dynasties, and, in, practice, superseded, those, works, in, the, mind, of, the, general, reader, the, great, song, neo, confucian, zhu, xi, found, the, mirror, to, be, overly, long, for, the, average, reader, as, well, as, too, morally, nihilist, and, therefore, prepared, a, didactic, summary, of, it, called, the, zizhi, tongjian, gangmu, digest, of, the, comprehensive, mirror, to, aid, in, government, posthumously, published, in, 1219, it, reduced, the, original, s, 249, chapters, to, just, 59, and, for, the, rest, of,

aspects, of, philippine, history, that, were, left, unexplained, the, interplay, of, pre, colonial, events, and, the, use, of, secondary, sources, written, by, historians, to, evaluate, the, primary, sources, do, not, provide, a, critical, examination, of, the, methodology, of, the, early, philippine, historical, study, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, the, modern, development, of, historiography, through, the, application, of, scrupulous, methods, began, among, the, many, italians, who, contributed, to, this, were, leonardo, bruni, c, 1370, 1444, francesco, guicciardini, 1483, 1540, and, cesare, baronio, 1538, 1607, french, philosophe, voltaire, 1694, 1778, had, an, enormous, influence, on, the, development, of, historiography, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, through, his, demonstration, of, fresh, new, ways, to, look, at, the, past, guillaume, de, syon, argues, voltaire, recast, historiography, in, both, factual, and, analytical, terms, not, only, did, he, reject, traditional, biographies, and, accounts, that, claim, the, work, of, supernatural, forces, but, he, went, so, far, as, to, suggest, that, earlier, historiography, was, rife, with, falsified, evidence, and, required, new, investigations, at, the, source, such, an, outlook, was, not, unique, in, that, the, scientific, spirit, that, 18th, century, intellectuals, perceived, themselves, as, invested, with, a, rationalistic, approach, was, key, to, rewriting, history, voltaire, s, best, known, histories, are, the, age, of, louis, xiv, 1751, and, his, essay, on, the, customs, and, the, spirit, of, the, nations, 1756, he, broke, from, the, tradition, of, narrating, diplomatic, and, military, events, and, emphasized, customs, social, history, and, achievements, in, the, arts, and, sciences, he, was, the, first, scholar, to, make, a, serious, attempt, to, write, the, history, of, the, world, eliminating, theological, frameworks, and, emphasizing, economics, culture, and, political, history, although, he, repeatedly, warned, against, political, bias, on, the, part, of, the, historian, he, did, not, miss, many, opportunities, to, expose, the, intolerance, and, frauds, of, the, church, over, the, ages, voltaire, advised, scholars, that, anything, contradicting, the, normal, course, of, nature, was, not, to, be, believed, although, he, found, evil, in, the, historical, record, he, fervently, believed, reason, and, educating, the, illiterate, masses, would, lead, to, progress, voltaire, s, history, of, charles, xii, 1731, about, the, swedish, warrior, king, swedish, karl, xii, is, also, one, of, his, most, famous, works, it, is, not, least, known, as, one, of, napoleon, s, absolute, favorite, books, voltaire, explains, his, view, of, historiography, in, his, article, on, history, in, diderot, s, encyclop, die, one, demands, of, modern, historians, more, details, better, ascertained, facts, precise, dates, more, attention, to, customs, laws, mores, commerce, finance, agriculture, population, already, in, 1739, he, had, written, my, chief, object, is, not, political, or, military, history, it, is, the, history, of, the, arts, of, commerce, of, civilization, in, a, word, of, the, human, mind, voltaire, s, histories, used, the, values, of, the, enlightenment, to, evaluate, the, past, he, helped, free, historiography, from, antiquarianism, eurocentrism, religious, intolerance, and, a, concentration, on, great, men, diplomacy, and, warfare, peter, gay, says, voltaire, wrote, very, good, history, citing, his, scrupulous, concern, for, truths, careful, sifting, of, evidence, intelligent, selection, of, what, is, important, keen, sense, of, drama, and, grasp, of, the, fact, that, a, whole, civilization, is, a, unit, of, study, at, the, same, time, philosopher, david, hume, was, having, a, similar, effect, on, the, study, of, history, in, great, britain, in, 1754, he, published, the, history, of, england, a, 6, volume, work, which, extended, from, the, invasion, of, julius, caesar, to, the, revolution, in, 1688, hume, adopted, a, similar, scope, to, voltaire, in, his, history, as, well, as, the, history, of, kings, parliaments, and, armies, he, examined, the, history, of, culture, including, literature, and, science, as, well, his, short, biographies, of, leading, scientists, explored, the, process, of, scientific, change, and, he, developed, new, ways, of, seeing, scientists, in, the, context, of, their, times, by, looking, at, how, they, interacted, with, society, and, each, other, he, paid, special, attention, to, francis, bacon, robert, boyle, isaac, newton, and, william, harvey, he, also, argued, that, the, quest, for, liberty, was, the, highest, standard, for, judging, the, past, and, concluded, that, after, considerable, fluctuation, england, at, the, time, of, his, writing, had, achieved, the, most, entire, system, of, liberty, that, was, ever, known, amongst, mankind, the, apex, of, enlightenment, history, was, reached, with, edward, gibbon, s, monumental, six, volume, work, the, history, of, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, published, on, 17, february, 1776, because, of, its, relative, objectivity, and, heavy, use, of, primary, sources, its, methodology, became, a, model, for, later, historians, this, has, led, to, gibbon, being, called, the, first, modern, historian, the, book, sold, impressively, earning, its, author, a, total, of, about, 9000, biographer, leslie, stephen, wrote, that, thereafter, his, fame, was, as, rapid, as, it, has, been, lasting, gibbon, s, work, has, been, praised, for, its, style, its, piquant, epigrams, and, its, effective, irony, winston, churchill, memorably, noted, i, set, out, upon, gibbon, s, decline, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, was, immediately, dominated, both, by, the, story, and, the, style, i, devoured, gibbon, i, rode, triumphantly, through, it, from, end, to, end, and, enjoyed, it, all, gibbon, was, pivotal, in, the, secularizing, and, desanctifying, of, history, remarking, for, example, on, the, want, of, truth, and, common, sense, of, biographies, composed, by, saint, jerome, unusually, for, an, 18th, century, historian, gibbon, was, never, content, with, secondhand, accounts, when, the, primary, sources, were, accessible, though, most, of, these, were, drawn, from, well, known, printed, editions, he, said, i, have, always, endeavoured, to, draw, from, the, fountain, head, that, my, curiosity, as, well, as, a, sense, of, duty, has, always, urged, me, to, study, the, originals, and, that, if, they, have, sometimes, eluded, my, search, i, have, carefully, marked, the, secondary, evidence, on, whose, faith, a, passage, or, a, fact, were, reduced, to, depend, in, this, insistence, upon, the, importance, of, primary, sources, gibbon, broke, new, ground, in, the, methodical, study, of, history, in, accuracy, thoroughness, lucidity, and, comprehensive, grasp, of, a, vast, subject, the, history, is, unsurpassable, it, is, the, one, english, history, which, may, be, regarded, as, definitive, whatever, its, shortcomings, the, book, is, artistically, imposing, as, well, as, historically, unimpeachable, as, a, vast, panorama, of, a, great, period, the, tumultuous, events, surrounding, the, french, revolution, inspired, much, of, the, historiography, and, analysis, of, the, early, 19th, century, interest, in, the, 1688, glorious, revolution, was, also, rekindled, by, the, great, reform, act, of, 1832, in, england, nineteenth, century, historiography, especially, among, american, historians, featured, conflicting, viewpoints, that, represented, the, times, according, to, 20th, century, historian, richard, hofstadter, the, historians, of, the, nineteenth, century, worked, under, the, pressure, of, two, internal, tensions, on, one, side, there, was, the, constant, demand, of, society, whether, through, the, nationstate, the, church, or, some, special, group, or, class, interest, for, memory, mixed, with, myth, for, the, historical, tale, that, would, strengthen, group, loyalties, or, confirm, national, pride, and, against, this, there, were, the, demands, of, critical, method, and, even, after, a, time, the, goal, of, writing, scientific, history, thomas, carlyle, published, his, three, volume, the, french, revolution, a, history, in, 1837, the, first, volume, was, accidentally, burned, by, john, stuart, mill, s, maid, carlyle, rewrote, it, from, scratch, carlyle, s, style, of, historical, writing, stressed, the, immediacy, of, action, often, using, the, present, tense, he, emphasised, the, role, of, forces, of, the, spirit, in, history, and, thought, that, chaotic, events, demanded, what, he, called, heroes, to, take, control, over, the, competing, forces, erupting, within, society, he, considered, the, dynamic, forces, of, history, as, being, the, hopes, and, aspirations, of, people, that, took, the, form, of, ideas, and, were, often, ossified, into, ideologies, carlyle, s, the, french, revolution, was, written, in, a, highly, unorthodox, style, far, removed, from, the, neutral, and, detached, tone, of, the, tradition, of, gibbon, carlyle, presented, the, history, as, dramatic, events, unfolding, in, the, present, as, though, he, and, the, reader, were, participants, on, the, streets, of, paris, at, the, famous, events, carlyle, s, invented, style, was, epic, poetry, combined, with, philosophical, treatise, it, is, rarely, read, or, cited, in, the, last, century, in, his, main, work, histoire, de, france, 1855, french, historian, jules, michelet, 1798, 1874, coined, the, term, renaissance, meaning, rebirth, in, french, as, a, period, in, europe, s, cultural, history, that, represented, a, break, from, the, middle, ages, creating, a, modern, understanding, of, humanity, and, its, place, in, the, world, the, 19, volume, work, covered, french, history, from, charlemagne, to, the, outbreak, of, the, french, revolution, his, inquiry, into, manuscript, and, printed, authorities, was, most, laborious, but, his, lively, imagination, and, his, strong, religious, and, political, prejudices, made, him, regard, all, things, from, a, singularly, personal, point, of, view, michelet, was, one, of, the, first, historians, to, shift, the, emphasis, of, history, to, the, common, people, rather, than, the, leaders, and, institutions, of, the, country, he, had, a, decisive, impact, on, scholars, gayana, jurkevich, argues, that, led, by, michelet, 19th, century, french, historians, no, longer, saw, history, as, the, chronicling, of, royal, dynasties, armies, treaties, and, great, men, of, state, but, as, the, history, of, ordinary, french, people, and, the, landscape, of, france, hippolyte, taine, 1828, 1893, although, unable, to, secure, an, academic, position, was, the, chief, theoretical, influence, of, french, naturalism, a, major, proponent, of, sociological, positivism, and, one, of, the, first, practitioners, of, historicist, criticism, he, pioneered, the, idea, of, the, milieu, as, an, active, historical, force, which, amalgamated, geographical, psychological, and, social, factors, historical, writing, for, him, was, a, search, for, general, laws, his, brilliant, style, kept, his, writing, in, circulation, long, after, his, theoretical, approaches, were, pass, one, of, the, major, progenitors, of, the, history, of, culture, and, art, was, the, swiss, historian, jacob, burckhardt, siegfried, giedion, described, burckhardt, s, achievement, in, the, following, terms, the, great, discoverer, of, the, age, of, the, renaissance, he, first, showed, how, a, period, should, be, treated, in, its, entirety, with, regard, not, only, for, its, painting, sculpture, and, architecture, but, for, the, social, institutions, of, its, daily, life, as, well, his, most, famous, work, was, the, civilization, of, the, renaissance, in, italy, published, in, 1860, it, was, the, most, influential, interpretation, of, the, italian, renaissance, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, is, still, widely, read, according, to, john, lukacs, he, was, the, first, master, of, cultural, history, which, seeks, to, describe, the, spirit, and, the, forms, of, expression, of, a, particular, age, a, particular, people, or, a, particular, place, his, innovative, approach, to, historical, research, stressed, the, importance, of, art, and, its, inestimable, value, as, a, primary, source, for, the, study, of, history, he, was, one, of, the, first, historians, to, rise, above, the, narrow, nineteenth, century, notion, that, history, is, past, politics, and, politics, current, history, by, the, mid, 19th, century, scholars, were, beginning, to, analyse, the, history, of, institutional, change, particularly, the, development, of, constitutional, government, william, stubbs, s, constitutional, history, of, england, 3, vols, 1874, 1878, was, an, important, influence, on, this, developing, field, the, work, traced, the, development, of, the, english, constitution, from, the, teutonic, invasions, of, britain, until, 1485, and, marked, a, distinct, step, in, the, advance, of, english, historical, learning, he, argued, that, the, theory, of, the, unity, and, continuity, of, history, should, not, remove, distinctions, between, ancient, and, modern, history, he, believed, that, though, work, on, ancient, history, is, a, useful, preparation, for, the, study, of, modern, history, either, may, advantageously, be, studied, apart, he, was, a, good, palaeographer, and, excelled, in, textual, criticism, in, examination, of, authorship, and, other, such, matters, while, his, vast, erudition, and, retentive, memory, made, him, second, to, none, in, interpretation, and, exposition, the, modern, academic, study, of, history, and, methods, of, historiography, were, pioneered, in, 19th, century, german, universities, especially, the, university, of, g, ttingen, leopold, von, ranke, 1795, 1886, at, berlin, was, a, pivotal, influence, in, this, regard, and, was, the, founder, of, modern, source, based, history, according, to, caroline, hoefferle, ranke, was, probably, the, most, important, historian, to, shape, historical, profession, as, it, emerged, in, europe, and, the, united, states, in, the, late, 19th, century, specifically, he, implemented, the, seminar, teaching, method, in, his, classroom, and, focused, on, archival, research, and, analysis, of, historical, documents, beginning, with, his, first, book, in, 1824, the, history, of, the, latin, and, teutonic, peoples, from, 1494, to, 1514, ranke, used, an, unusually, wide, variety, of, sources, for, a, historian, of, the, age, including, memoirs, diaries, personal, and, formal, missives, government, documents, diplomatic, dispatches, and, first, hand, accounts, of, eye, witnesses, over, a, career, that, spanned, much, of, the, century, ranke, set, the, standards, for, much, of, later, historical, writing, introducing, such, ideas, as, reliance, on, primary, sources, an, emphasis, on, narrative, history, and, especially, international, politics, aussenpolitik, sources, had, to, be, solid, not, speculations, and, rationalizations, his, credo, was, to, write, history, the, way, it, was, he, insisted, on, primary, sources, with, proven, authenticity, ranke, also, rejected, the, teleological, approach, to, history, which, traditionally, viewed, each, period, as, inferior, to, the, period, which, follows, in, ranke, s, view, the, historian, had, to, understand, a, period, on, its, own, terms, and, seek, to, find, only, the, general, ideas, which, animated, every, period, of, history, in, 1831, and, at, the, behest, of, the, prussian, government, ranke, founded, and, edited, the, first, historical, journal, in, the, world, called, historisch, politische, zeitschrift, another, important, german, thinker, was, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, whose, theory, of, historical, progress, ran, counter, to, ranke, s, approach, in, hegel, s, own, words, his, philosophical, theory, of, world, history, represents, the, development, of, the, spirit, s, consciousness, of, its, own, freedom, and, of, the, consequent, realization, of, this, freedom, this, realization, is, seen, by, studying, the, various, cultures, that, have, developed, over, the, millennia, and, trying, to, understand, the, way, that, freedom, has, worked, itself, out, through, them, world, history, is, the, record, of, the, spirit, s, efforts, to, attain, knowledge, of, what, it, is, in, itself, the, orientals, do, not, know, that, the, spirit, or, man, as, such, are, free, in, themselves, and, because, they, do, not, know, that, they, are, not, themselves, free, they, only, know, that, one, is, free, the, consciousness, of, freedom, first, awoke, among, the, greeks, and, they, were, accordingly, free, but, like, the, romans, they, only, knew, that, some, and, not, all, men, as, such, are, free, the, germanic, nations, with, the, rise, of, christianity, were, the, first, to, realize, that, all, men, are, by, nature, free, and, that, freedom, of, spirit, is, his, very, essence, karl, marx, introduced, the, concept, of, historical, materialism, into, the, study, of, world, historical, development, in, his, conception, the, economic, conditions, and, dominant, modes, of, production, determined, the, structure, of, society, at, that, point, in, his, view, five, successive, stages, in, the, development, of, material, conditions, would, occur, in, western, europe, the, first, stage, was, primitive, communism, where, property, was, shared, and, there, was, no, concept, of, leadership, this, progressed, to, a, slave, society, where, the, idea, of, class, emerged, and, the, state, developed, feudalism, was, characterized, by, an, aristocracy, working, in, partnership, with, a, theocracy, and, the, emergence, of, the, nation, state, capitalism, appeared, after, the, bourgeois, revolution, when, the, capitalists, or, their, merchant, predecessors, overthrew, the, feudal, system, and, established, a, market, economy, with, private, property, and, parliamentary, democracy, marx, then, predicted, the, eventual, proletarian, revolution, that, would, result, in, the, attainment, of, socialism, followed, by, communism, where, property, would, be, communally, owned, previous, historians, had, focused, on, cyclical, events, of, the, rise, and, decline, of, rulers, and, nations, process, of, nationalization, of, history, as, part, of, national, revivals, in, the, 19th, century, resulted, with, separation, of, one, s, own, history, from, common, universal, history, by, such, way, of, perceiving, understanding, and, treating, the, past, that, constructed, history, as, history, of, a, nation, a, new, discipline, sociology, emerged, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, analyzed, and, compared, these, perspectives, on, a, larger, scale, the, term, whig, history, coined, by, herbert, butterfield, in, his, short, book, the, whig, interpretation, of, history, in, 1931, means, the, approach, to, historiography, which, presents, the, past, as, an, inevitable, progression, towards, ever, greater, liberty, and, enlightenment, culminating, in, modern, forms, of, liberal, democracy, and, constitutional, monarchy, in, general, whig, historians, emphasized, the, rise, of, constitutional, government, personal, freedoms, and, scientific, progress, the, term, has, been, also, applied, widely, in, historical, disciplines, outside, of, british, history, the, history, of, science, for, example, to, criticize, any, teleological, or, goal, directed, hero, based, and, transhistorical, narrative, paul, rapin, de, thoyras, s, history, of, england, published, in, 1723, became, the, classic, whig, history, for, the, first, half, of, the, 18th, century, it, was, later, supplanted, by, the, immensely, popular, the, history, of, england, by, david, hume, whig, historians, emphasized, the, achievements, of, the, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, this, included, james, mackintosh, s, history, of, the, revolution, in, england, in, 1688, william, blackstone, s, commentaries, on, the, laws, of, england, and, henry, hallam, s, constitutional, history, of, england, the, most, famous, exponent, of, whiggery, was, thomas, babington, macaulay, his, writings, are, famous, for, their, ringing, prose, and, for, their, confident, sometimes, dogmatic, emphasis, on, a, progressive, model, of, british, history, according, to, which, the, country, threw, off, superstition, autocracy, and, confusion, to, create, a, balanced, constitution, and, a, forward, looking, culture, combined, with, freedom, of, belief, and, expression, this, model, of, human, progress, has, been, called, the, whig, interpretation, of, history, he, published, the, first, volumes, of, his, most, famous, work, of, history, the, history, of, england, from, the, accession, of, james, ii, in, 1848, it, proved, an, immediate, success, and, replaced, hume, s, history, to, become, the, new, orthodoxy, his, whiggish, convictions, are, spelled, out, in, his, first, chapter, i, shall, relate, how, the, new, settlement, was, successfully, defended, against, foreign, and, domestic, enemies, how, the, authority, of, law, and, the, security, of, property, were, found, to, be, compatible, with, a, liberty, of, discussion, and, of, individual, action, never, before, known, how, from, the, auspicious, union, of, order, and, freedom, sprang, a, prosperity, of, which, the, annals, of, human, affairs, had, furnished, no, example, how, our, country, from, a, state, of, ignominious, vassalage, rapidly, rose, to, the, place, of, umpire, among, european, powers, how, her, opulence, and, her, martial, glory, grew, together, how, a, gigantic, commerce, gave, birth, to, a, maritime, power, compared, with, which, every, other, maritime, power, ancient, or, modern, sinks, into, insignificance, the, history, of, our, country, during, the, last, hundred, and, sixty, years, is, eminently, the, history, of, physical, of, moral, and, of, intellectual, improvement, his, legacy, continues, to, be, controversial, gertrude, himmelfarb, wrote, that, most, professional, historians, have, long, since, given, up, reading, macaulay, as, they, have, given, up, writing, the, kind, of, history, he, wrote, and, thinking, about, history, as, he, did, however, j, r, western, wrote, that, despite, its, age, and, blemishes, macaulay, s, history, of, england, has, still, to, be, superseded, by, a, full, scale, modern, history, of, the, period, the, whig, consensus, was, steadily, undermined, during, the, post, world, war, i, re, evaluation, of, european, history, and, butterfield, s, critique, exemplified, this, trend, intellectuals, no, longer, believed, the, world, was, automatically, getting, better, and, better, subsequent, generations, of, academic, historians, have, similarly, rejected, whig, history, because, of, its, presentist, and, teleological, assumption, that, history, is, driving, toward, some, sort, of, goal, other, criticized, whig, assumptions, included, viewing, the, british, system, as, the, apex, of, human, political, development, assuming, that, political, figures, in, the, past, held, current, political, beliefs, anachronism, considering, british, history, as, a, march, of, progress, with, inevitable, outcomes, and, presenting, political, figures, of, the, past, as, heroes, who, advanced, the, cause, of, this, political, progress, or, villains, who, sought, to, hinder, its, inevitable, triumph, j, hart, says, a, whig, interpretation, requires, human, heroes, and, villains, in, the, story, 20th, century, historiography, in, major, countries, is, characterized, by, a, move, to, universities, and, academic, research, centers, popular, history, continued, to, be, written, by, self, educated, amateurs, but, scholarly, history, increasingly, became, the, province, of, phd, s, trained, in, research, seminars, at, a, university, the, training, emphasized, working, with, primary, sources, in, archives, seminars, taught, graduate, students, how, to, review, the, historiography, of, the, topics, so, that, they, could, understand, the, conceptual, frameworks, currently, in, use, and, the, criticisms, regarding, their, strengths, and, weaknesses, western, europe, and, the, united, states, took, leading, roles, in, this, development, the, emergence, of, area, studies, of, other, regions, also, developed, historiographical, practices, the, french, annales, school, radically, changed, the, focus, of, historical, research, in, france, during, the, 20th, century, by, stressing, long, term, social, history, rather, than, political, or, diplomatic, themes, the, school, emphasized, the, use, of, quantification, and, the, paying, of, special, attention, to, geography, the, annales, d, histoire, conomique, et, sociale, journal, was, founded, in, 1929, in, strasbourg, by, marc, bloch, and, lucien, febvre, these, authors, the, former, a, medieval, historian, and, the, latter, an, early, modernist, quickly, became, associated, with, the, distinctive, annales, approach, which, combined, geography, history, and, the, sociological, approaches, of, the, ann, e, sociologique, many, members, of, which, were, their, colleagues, at, strasbourg, to, produce, an, approach, which, rejected, the, predominant, emphasis, on, politics, diplomacy, and, war, of, many, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, historians, as, spearheaded, by, historians, whom, febvre, called, les, sorbonnistes, instead, they, pioneered, an, approach, to, a, study, of, long, term, historical, structures, la, longue, dur, e, over, events, and, political, transformations, geography, material, culture, and, what, later, annalistes, called, mentalit, s, or, the, psychology, of, the, epoch, are, also, characteristic, areas, of, study, the, goal, of, the, annales, was, to, undo, the, work, of, the, sorbonnistes, to, turn, french, historians, away, from, the, narrowly, political, and, diplomatic, toward, the, new, vistas, in, social, and, economic, history, for, early, modern, mexican, history, the, work, of, marc, bloch, s, student, fran, ois, chevalier, on, the, formation, of, landed, estates, haciendas, from, the, sixteenth, century, to, the, seventeenth, had, a, major, impact, on, mexican, history, and, historiography, setting, off, an, important, debate, about, whether, landed, estates, were, basically, feudal, or, capitalistic, an, eminent, member, of, this, school, georges, duby, described, his, approach, to, history, as, one, that, relegated, the, sensational, to, the, sidelines, and, was, reluctant, to, give, a, simple, accounting, of, events, but, strived, on, the, contrary, to, pose, and, solve, problems, and, neglecting, surface, disturbances, to, observe, the, long, and, medium, term, evolution, of, economy, society, and, civilisation, the, annalistes, especially, lucien, febvre, advocated, a, histoire, totale, or, histoire, tout, court, a, complete, study, of, a, historical, problem, the, second, era, of, the, school, was, led, by, fernand, braudel, and, was, very, influential, throughout, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, especially, for, his, work, on, the, mediterranean, region, in, the, era, of, philip, ii, of, spain, braudel, developed, the, idea, often, associated, with, annalistes, of, different, modes, of, historical, time, l, histoire, quasi, immobile, motionless, history, of, historical, geography, the, history, of, social, political, and, economic, structures, la, longue, dur, e, and, the, history, of, men, and, events, in, the, context, of, their, structures, his, longue, dur, e, approach, stressed, slow, and, often, imperceptible, effects, of, space, climate, and, technology, on, the, actions, of, human, beings, in, the, past, the, annales, historians, after, living, through, two, world, wars, and, major, political, upheavals, in, france, were, deeply, uncomfortable, with, the, notion, that, multiple, ruptures, and, discontinuities, created, history, they, preferred, to, stress, slow, change, and, the, longue, dur, e, they, paid, special, attention, to, geography, climate, and, demography, as, long, term, factors, they, considered, the, continuities, of, the, deepest, structures, were, central, to, history, beside, which, upheavals, in, institutions, or, the, superstructure, of, social, life, were, of, little, significance, for, history, lies, beyond, the, reach, of, conscious, actors, especially, the, will, of, revolutionaries, noting, the, political, upheavals, in, europe, and, especially, in, france, in, 1968, eric, hobsbawm, argued, that, in, france, the, virtual, hegemony, of, braudelian, history, and, the, annales, came, to, an, end, after, 1968, and, the, international, influence, of, the, journal, dropped, steeply, multiple, responses, were, attempted, by, the, school, scholars, moved, in, multiple, directions, covering, in, disconnected, fashion, the, social, economic, and, cultural, history, of, different, eras, and, different, parts, of, the, globe, by, the, time, of, crisis, the, school, was, building, a, vast, publishing, and, research, network, reaching, across, france, europe, and, the, rest, of, the, world, influence, indeed, spread, out, from, paris, but, few, new, ideas, came, in, much, emphasis, was, given, to, quantitative, data, seen, as, the, key, to, unlocking, all, of, social, history, however, the, annales, ignored, the, developments, in, quantitative, studies, underway, in, the, u, s, and, britain, which, reshaped, economic, political, and, demographic, research, marxist, historiography, developed, as, a, school, of, historiography, influenced, by, the, chief, tenets, of, marxism, including, the, centrality, of, social, class, and, economic, constraints, in, determining, historical, outcomes, historical, materialism, friedrich, engels, wrote, the, peasant, war, in, germany, which, analysed, social, warfare, in, early, protestant, germany, in, terms, of, emerging, capitalist, classes, although, it, lacked, a, rigorous, engagement, with, archival, sources, it, indicated, an, early, interest, in, history, from, below, and, class, analysis, and, it, attempts, a, dialectical, analysis, another, treatise, of, engels, the, condition, of, the, working, class, in, england, in, 1844, was, salient, in, creating, the,

sixteenth, century, 1912, and, religion, and, the, rise, of, capitalism, 1926, reflected, his, ethical, concerns, and, preoccupations, in, economic, history, he, was, profoundly, interested, in, the, issue, of, the, enclosure, of, land, in, the, english, countryside, in, the, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, centuries, and, in, max, weber, s, thesis, on, the, connection, between, the, appearance, of, protestantism, and, the, rise, of, capitalism, his, belief, in, the, rise, of, the, gentry, in, the, century, before, the, outbreak, of, the, civil, war, in, england, provoked, the, storm, over, the, gentry, in, which, his, methods, were, subjected, to, severe, criticisms, by, hugh, trevor, roper, and, john, cooper, historiography, in, the, soviet, union, was, greatly, influenced, by, marxist, historiography, as, historical, materialism, was, extended, into, the, soviet, version, of, dialectical, materialism, a, circle, of, historians, inside, the, communist, party, of, great, britain, cpgb, formed, in, 1946, and, became, a, highly, influential, cluster, of, british, marxist, historians, who, contributed, to, history, from, below, and, class, structure, in, early, capitalist, society, while, some, members, of, the, group, most, notably, christopher, hill, and, e, p, thompson, left, the, cpgb, after, the, 1956, hungarian, revolution, the, common, points, of, british, marxist, historiography, continued, in, their, works, they, placed, a, great, emphasis, on, the, subjective, determination, of, history, christopher, hill, s, studies, on, 17th, century, english, history, were, widely, acknowledged, and, recognised, as, representative, of, this, school, his, books, include, puritanism, and, revolution, 1958, intellectual, origins, of, the, english, revolution, 1965, and, revised, in, 1996, the, century, of, revolution, 1961, antichrist, in, 17th, century, england, 1971, the, world, turned, upside, down, 1972, and, many, others, e, p, thompson, pioneered, the, study, of, history, from, below, in, his, work, the, making, of, the, english, working, class, published, in, 1963, it, focused, on, the, forgotten, history, of, the, first, working, class, political, left, in, the, world, in, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, in, his, preface, to, this, book, thompson, set, out, his, approach, to, writing, history, from, below, i, am, seeking, to, rescue, the, poor, stockinger, the, luddite, cropper, the, obsolete, hand, loom, weaver, the, utopian, artisan, and, even, the, deluded, follower, of, joanna, southcott, from, the, enormous, condescension, of, posterity, their, crafts, and, traditions, may, have, been, dying, their, hostility, to, the, new, industrialism, may, have, been, backward, looking, their, communitarian, ideals, may, have, been, fantasies, their, insurrectionary, conspiracies, may, have, been, foolhardy, but, they, lived, through, these, times, of, acute, social, disturbance, and, we, did, not, their, aspirations, were, valid, in, terms, of, their, own, experience, and, if, they, were, casualties, of, history, they, remain, condemned, in, their, own, lives, as, casualties, thompson, s, work, was, also, significant, because, of, the, way, he, defined, class, he, argued, that, class, was, not, a, structure, but, a, relationship, that, changed, over, time, he, opened, the, gates, for, a, generation, of, labor, historians, such, as, david, montgomery, and, herbert, gutman, who, made, similar, studies, of, the, american, working, classes, other, important, marxist, historians, included, eric, hobsbawm, c, l, r, james, raphael, samuel, a, l, morton, and, brian, pearce, biography, has, been, a, major, form, of, historiography, since, the, days, when, plutarch, wrote, the, parallel, lives, of, great, roman, and, greek, leaders, it, is, a, field, especially, attractive, to, nonacademic, historians, and, often, to, the, spouses, or, children, of, famous, people, who, have, access, to, the, trove, of, letters, and, documents, academic, historians, tend, to, downplay, biography, because, it, pays, too, little, attention, to, broad, social, cultural, political, and, economic, forces, and, perhaps, too, much, attention, to, popular, psychology, the, great, man, tradition, in, britain, originated, in, the, multi, volume, dictionary, of, national, biography, which, originated, in, 1882, and, issued, updates, into, the, 1970s, it, continues, to, this, day, in, the, new, oxford, dictionary, of, national, biography, in, the, united, states, the, dictionary, of, american, biography, was, planned, in, the, late, 1920s, and, appeared, with, numerous, supplements, into, the, 1980s, it, has, now, been, displaced, by, the, american, national, biography, as, well, as, numerous, smaller, historical, encyclopedias, that, give, thorough, coverage, to, great, persons, bookstores, do, a, thriving, business, in, biographies, which, sell, far, more, copies, than, the, esoteric, monographs, based, on, post, structuralism, cultural, racial, or, gender, history, michael, holroyd, says, the, last, forty, years, may, be, seen, as, a, golden, age, of, biography, but, nevertheless, calls, it, the, shallow, end, of, history, nicolas, barker, argues, that, more, and, more, biographies, command, an, ever, larger, readership, as, he, speculates, that, biography, has, come, to, express, the, spirit, of, our, age, daniel, r, meister, argues, that, biography, studies, is, emerging, as, an, independent, discipline, especially, in, the, netherlands, this, dutch, school, of, biography, is, moving, biography, studies, away, from, the, less, scholarly, life, writing, tradition, and, towards, history, by, encouraging, its, practitioners, to, utilize, an, approach, adapted, from, microhistory, marxist, historian, e, h, carr, developed, a, controversial, theory, of, history, in, his, 1961, book, what, is, history, which, proved, to, be, one, of, the, most, influential, books, ever, written, on, the, subject, he, presented, a, middle, of, the, road, position, between, the, empirical, or, rankean, view, of, history, and, r, g, collingwood, s, idealism, and, rejected, the, empirical, view, of, the, historian, s, work, being, an, accretion, of, facts, that, they, have, at, their, disposal, as, nonsense, he, maintained, that, there, is, such, a, vast, quantity, of, information, that, the, historian, always, chooses, the, facts, they, decide, to, make, use, of, in, carr, s, famous, example, he, claimed, that, millions, had, crossed, the, rubicon, but, only, julius, caesar, s, crossing, in, 49, bc, is, declared, noteworthy, by, historians, for, this, reason, carr, argued, that, leopold, von, ranke, s, famous, dictum, wie, es, eigentlich, gewesen, show, what, actually, happened, was, wrong, because, it, presumed, that, the, facts, influenced, what, the, historian, wrote, rather, than, the, historian, choosing, what, facts, of, the, past, they, intended, to, turn, into, historical, facts, at, the, same, time, carr, argued, that, the, study, of, the, facts, may, lead, the, historian, to, change, his, or, her, views, in, this, way, carr, argued, that, history, was, an, unending, dialogue, between, the, past, and, present, carr, is, held, by, some, critics, to, have, had, a, deterministic, outlook, in, history, others, have, modified, or, rejected, this, use, of, the, label, determinist, he, took, a, hostile, view, of, those, historians, who, stress, the, workings, of, chance, and, contingency, in, the, workings, of, history, in, carr, s, view, no, individual, is, truly, free, of, the, social, environment, in, which, they, live, but, contended, that, within, those, limitations, there, was, room, albeit, very, narrow, room, for, people, to, make, decisions, that, affect, history, carr, emphatically, contended, that, history, was, a, social, science, not, an, art, because, historians, like, scientists, seek, generalizations, that, helped, to, broaden, the, understanding, of, one, s, subject, one, of, carr, s, most, forthright, critics, was, hugh, trevor, roper, who, argued, that, carr, s, dismissal, of, the, might, have, beens, of, history, reflected, a, fundamental, lack, of, interest, in, examining, historical, causation, trevor, roper, asserted, that, examining, possible, alternative, outcomes, of, history, was, far, from, being, a, parlour, game, was, rather, an, essential, part, of, the, historians, work, as, only, by, considering, all, possible, outcomes, of, a, given, situation, could, a, historian, properly, understand, the, period, the, controversy, inspired, sir, geoffrey, elton, to, write, his, 1967, book, the, practice, of, history, elton, criticized, carr, for, his, whimsical, distinction, between, the, historical, facts, and, the, facts, of, the, past, arguing, that, it, reflected, an, extraordinarily, arrogant, attitude, both, to, the, past, and, to, the, place, of, the, historian, studying, it, elton, instead, strongly, defended, the, traditional, methods, of, history, and, was, also, appalled, by, the, inroads, made, by, postmodernism, elton, saw, the, duty, of, historians, as, empirically, gathering, evidence, and, objectively, analyzing, what, the, evidence, has, to, say, as, a, traditionalist, he, placed, great, emphasis, on, the, role, of, individuals, in, history, instead, of, abstract, impersonal, forces, elton, saw, political, history, as, the, highest, kind, of, history, elton, had, no, use, for, those, who, seek, history, to, make, myths, to, create, laws, to, explain, the, past, or, to, produce, theories, such, as, marxism, classical, and, european, history, was, part, of, the, 19th, century, grammar, curriculum, american, history, became, a, topic, later, in, the, 19th, century, in, the, historiography, of, the, united, states, there, were, a, series, of, major, approaches, in, the, 20th, century, in, 2009, 2012, there, were, an, average, of, 16, 000, new, academic, history, books, published, in, the, u, s, every, year, the, progressive, historians, were, a, group, of, 20th, century, historians, of, the, united, states, associated, with, a, historiographical, tradition, that, embraced, an, economic, interpretation, of, american, history, most, prominent, among, these, was, charles, a, beard, who, was, influential, in, academia, and, with, the, general, public, consensus, history, emphasizes, the, basic, unity, of, american, values, and, downplays, conflict, as, superficial, it, was, especially, attractive, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, prominent, leaders, included, richard, hofstadter, louis, hartz, daniel, boorstin, allan, nevins, clinton, rossiter, edmund, morgan, and, david, m, potter, in, 1948, hofstadter, made, a, compelling, statement, of, the, consensus, model, of, the, u, s, political, tradition, the, fierceness, of, the, political, struggles, has, often, been, misleading, for, the, range, of, vision, embraced, by, the, primary, contestants, in, the, major, parties, has, always, been, bounded, by, the, horizons, of, property, and, enterprise, however, much, at, odds, on, specific, issues, the, major, political, traditions, have, shared, a, belief, in, the, rights, of, property, the, philosophy, of, economic, individualism, the, value, of, competition, they, have, accepted, the, economic, virtues, of, capitalist, culture, as, necessary, qualities, of, man, consensus, history, was, rejected, by, new, left, viewpoints, that, attracted, a, younger, generation, of, radical, historians, in, the, 1960s, these, viewpoints, stress, conflict, and, emphasize, the, central, roles, of, class, race, and, gender, the, history, of, dissent, and, the, experiences, of, racial, minorities, and, disadvantaged, classes, was, central, to, the, narratives, produced, by, new, left, historians, social, history, sometimes, called, the, new, social, history, is, a, broad, branch, that, studies, the, experiences, of, ordinary, people, in, the, past, it, had, major, growth, as, a, field, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, and, still, is, well, represented, in, history, departments, however, after, 1980, the, cultural, turn, directed, the, next, generation, to, new, topics, in, the, two, decades, from, 1975, to, 1995, the, proportion, of, professors, of, history, in, u, s, universities, identifying, with, social, history, rose, from, 31, to, 41, percent, while, the, proportion, of, political, historians, fell, from, 40, to, 30, percent, the, growth, was, enabled, by, the, social, sciences, computers, statistics, new, data, sources, such, as, individual, census, information, and, summer, training, programs, at, the, newberry, library, and, the, university, of, michigan, the, new, political, history, saw, the, application, of, social, history, methods, to, politics, as, the, focus, shifted, from, politicians, and, legislation, to, voters, and, elections, the, social, science, history, association, was, formed, in, 1976, as, an, interdisciplinary, group, with, a, journal, social, science, history, and, an, annual, convention, the, goal, was, to, incorporate, in, historical, studies, perspectives, from, all, the, social, sciences, especially, political, science, sociology, and, economics, the, pioneers, shared, a, commitment, to, quantification, however, by, the, 1980s, the, first, blush, of, quantification, had, worn, off, as, traditional, historians, counterattacked, harvey, j, graff, says, the, case, against, the, new, mixed, and, confused, a, lengthy, list, of, ingredients, including, the, following, history, s, supposed, loss, of, identity, and, humanity, in, the, stain, of, social, science, the, fear, of, subordinating, quality, to, quantity, conceptual, and, technical, fallacies, violation, of, the, literary, character, and, biographical, base, of, good, history, rhetorical, and, aesthetic, concern, loss, of, audiences, derogation, of, history, rooted, in, great, men, and, great, events, trivialization, in, general, a, hodgepodge, of, ideological, objections, from, all, directions, and, a, fear, that, new, historians, were, reaping, research, funds, that, might, otherwise, come, to, their, detractors, to, defenders, of, history, as, they, knew, it, the, discipline, was, in, crisis, and, the, pursuit, of, the, new, was, a, major, cause, meanwhile, new, economic, history, became, well, established, however, cliometrics, has, never, been, considered, a, historical, field, by, the, vast, majority, of, historians, so, that, cliometric, articles, have, not, been, cited, by, historians, economists, mostly, employed, economic, theories, and, econometric, applications, similar, to, typical, economic, papers, as, a, result, quantification, remained, central, to, demographic, studies, but, slipped, behind, in, political, and, social, history, as, traditional, narrative, approaches, made, a, comeback, recently, as, the, newest, approach, in, economic, history, new, history, of, capitalism, appeared, in, the, first, article, of, the, related, journal, marc, flandreau,

portuguese, brazil, professional, historians, pioneered, the, creation, of, this, field, starting, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, the, term, latin, america, did, not, come, into, general, usage, until, the, twentieth, century, and, in, some, cases, it, was, rejected, the, historiography, of, the, field, has, been, more, fragmented, than, unified, with, historians, of, spanish, america, and, brazil, generally, remaining, in, separate, spheres, another, standard, division, within, the, historiography, is, the, temporal, factor, with, works, falling, into, either, the, early, modern, period, or, colonial, era, or, the, post, independence, or, national, period, from, the, early, nineteenth, onward, relatively, few, works, span, the, two, eras, and, few, works, except, textbooks, unite, spanish, america, and, brazil, there, is, a, tendency, to, focus, on, histories, of, particular, countries, or, regions, the, andes, the, southern, cone, the, caribbean, with, relatively, little, comparative, work, historians, of, latin, america, have, contributed, to, various, types, of, historical, writing, but, one, major, innovative, development, in, spanish, american, history, is, the, emergence, of, ethnohistory, the, history, of, indigenous, peoples, especially, in, mexico, based, on, alphabetic, sources, in, spanish, or, in, indigenous, languages, for, the, early, modern, period, the, emergence, of, atlantic, history, based, on, comparisons, and, linkages, of, europe, the, americas, and, africa, from, 1450, to, 1850, that, developed, as, a, field, in, its, own, right, has, integrated, early, modern, latin, american, history, into, a, larger, framework, for, all, periods, global, or, world, history, have, focused, on, the, connections, between, areas, likewise, integrating, latin, america, into, a, larger, perspective, latin, america, s, importance, to, world, history, is, notable, but, often, overlooked, latin, america, s, central, and, sometimes, pioneering, role, in, the, development, of, globalization, and, modernity, did, not, cease, with, the, end, of, colonial, rule, and, the, early, modern, period, indeed, the, region, s, political, independence, places, it, at, the, forefront, of, two, trends, that, are, regularly, considered, thresholds, of, the, modern, world, the, first, is, the, so, called, liberal, revolution, the, shift, from, monarchies, of, the, ancien, r, gime, where, inheritance, legitimated, political, power, to, constitutional, republics, the, second, and, related, trend, consistently, considered, a, threshold, of, modern, history, that, saw, latin, america, in, the, forefront, is, the, development, of, nation, states, historical, research, appears, in, a, number, of, specialized, journals, these, include, hispanic, american, historical, review, est, 1918, published, by, the, conference, on, latin, american, history, the, americas, est, 1944, journal, of, latin, american, studies, 1969, canadian,

published, historiographical, essays, on, particular, topics, general, works, on, latin, american, history, have, appeared, since, the, 1950s, when, the, teaching, of, latin, american, history, expanded, in, u, s, universities, and, colleges, most, attempt, full, coverage, of, spanish, america, and, brazil, from, the, conquest, to, the, modern, era, focusing, on, institutional, political, social, and, economic, history, an, important, eleven, volume, treatment, of, latin, american, history, is, the, cambridge, history, of, latin, america, with, separate, volumes, on, the, colonial, era, nineteenth, century, and, the, twentieth, century, there, is, a, small, number, of, general, works, that, have, gone, through, multiple, editions, major, trade, publishers, have, also, issued, edited, volumes, on, latin, american, history, and, historiography, reference, works, include, the, handbook, of, latin, american, studies, which, publishes, articles, by, area, experts, with, annotated, bibliographic, entries, and, the, encyclopedia, of, latin, american, history, and, culture, world, history, as, a, distinct, field, of, historical, study, emerged, as, an, independent, academic, field, in, the, 1980s, it, focused, on, the, examination, of, history, from, a, global, perspective, and, looked, for, common, patterns, that, emerged, across, all, cultures, the, basic, thematic, approach, of, this, field, was, to, analyse, two, major, focal, points, integration, how, processes, of, world, history, have, drawn, people, of, the, world, together, and, difference, how, patterns, of, world, history, reveal, the, diversity, of, the, human, experience, arnold, j, toynbee, s, ten, volume, a, study, of, history, took, an, approach, that, was, widely, discussed, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, by, the, 1960s, his, work, was, virtually, ignored, by, scholars, and, the, general, public, he, compared, 26, independent, civilizations, and, argued, that, they, displayed, striking, parallels, in, their, origin, growth, and, decay, he, proposed, a, universal, model, to, each, of, these, civilizations, detailing, the, stages, through, which, they, all, pass, genesis, growth, time, of, troubles, universal, state, and, disintegration, the, later, volumes, gave, too, much, emphasis, on, spirituality, to, satisfy, critics, chicago, historian, william, h, mcneill, wrote, the, rise, of, the, west, 1965, to, show, how, the, separate, civilizations, of, eurasia, interacted, from, the, very, beginning, of, their, history, borrowing, critical, skills, from, one, another, and, thus, precipitating, still, further, change, as, adjustment, between, traditional, old, and, borrowed, new, knowledge, and, practice, became, necessary, he, then, discusses, the, dramatic, effect, of, western, civilization, on, others, in, the, past, 500, years, of, history, mcneill, took, a, broad, approach, organized, around, the, interactions, of, peoples, across, the, globe, such, interactions, have, become, both, more, numerous, and, more, continual, and, substantial, in, recent, times, before, about, 1500, the, network, of, communication, between, cultures, was, that, of, eurasia, the, term, for, these, areas, of, interaction, differ, from, one, world, historian, to, another, and, include, world, system, and, ecumene, his, emphasis, on, cultural, fusions, influenced, historical, theory, significantly, the, cultural, turn, of, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, affected, scholars, in, most, areas, of, history, inspired, largely, by, anthropology, it, turned, away, from, leaders, ordinary, people, and, famous, events, to, look, at, the, use, of, language, and, cultural, symbols, to, represent, the, changing, values, of, society, the, british, historian, peter, burke, finds, that, cultural, studies, has, numerous, spinoffs, or, topical, themes, it, has, strongly, influenced, the, most, important, include, gender, studies, and, postcolonial, studies, as,
