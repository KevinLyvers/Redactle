the, xiongnu, chinese, were, a, tribal, confederation, of, nomadic, peoples, who, according, to, ancient, chinese, sources, inhabited, the, eastern, eurasian, steppe, from, the, 3rd, century, bc, to, the, late, 1st, century, ad, modu, chanyu, the, supreme, leader, after, 209, bc, founded, the, xiongnu, empire, after, overthrowing, their, previous, overlords, the, yuezhi, the, xiongnu, became, the, dominant, power, on, the, steppes, of, east, asia, centred, on, the, mongolian, plateau, the, xiongnu, were, also, active, in, areas, now, part, of, siberia, inner, mongolia, gansu, and, xinjiang, their, relations, with, adjacent, chinese, dynasties, to, the, south, east, were, complex, alternating, between, various, periods, of, peace, war, and, subjugation, ultimately, the, xiongnu, were, defeated, by, the, han, dynasty, in, a, centuries, long, conflict, which, led, to, the, confederation, splitting, in, two, and, forcible, resettlement, of, large, numbers, of, xiongnu, within, han, borders, during, the, sixteen, kingdoms, era, as, one, of, the, five, barbarians, they, founded, the, dynastic, states, of, han, zhao, northern, liang, and, helian, xia, in, northern, china, attempts, to, associate, the, xiongnu, with, the, nearby, sakas, and, sarmatians, were, once, controversial, however, archaeogenetics, has, confirmed, their, interaction, with, the, xiongnu, and, also, possibly, their, relation, to, the, huns, the, identity, of, the, ethnic, core, of, xiongnu, has, been, a, subject, of, varied, hypotheses, because, only, a, few, words, mainly, titles, and, personal, names, were, preserved, in, the, chinese, sources, the, name, xiongnu, may, be, cognate, with, that, of, the, huns, and, or, the, huna, although, this, is, disputed, other, linguistic, links, all, of, them, also, controversial, proposed, by, scholars, include, turkic, iranian, mongolic, uralic, yeniseian, or, multi, ethnic, the, pronunciation, of, as, xi, ngn, is, the, modern, mandarin, chinese, pronunciation, from, the, mandarin, dialect, spoken, now, in, beijing, which, came, into, existence, less, than, 1, 000, years, ago, the, old, chinese, pronunciation, has, been, reconstructed, as, xiuo, na, or, qho, na, sinologist, axel, schuessler, 2014, reconstructs, the, pronunciations, of, as, ho, n, in, late, old, chinese, c, 318, bce, and, as, h, o, n, in, eastern, han, chinese, citing, other, chinese, transcriptions, wherein, the, velar, nasal, medial, after, a, short, vowel, seemingly, played, the, role, of, a, general, nasal, sometimes, equivalent, to, n, or, m, schuessler, proposes, that, xiongnu, h, o, n, ho, n, might, be, a, chinese, rendition, han, or, even, pre, han, of, foreign, h, na, or, h, na, which, schuessler, compares, to, huns, and, sanskrit, h, however, the, same, medial, prompts, christopher, p, atwood, 2015, to, reconstruct, xo, ai, which, he, derives, from, the, ongi, river, mongolian, in, mongolia, and, suggests, that, it, was, originally, a, dynastic, name, rather, than, an, ethnic, name, the, territories, associated, with, the, xiongnu, in, central, east, mongolia, were, previously, inhabited, by, the, slab, grave, culture, ancient, northeast, asian, origin, which, persisted, until, the, 3rd, century, bc, genetic, research, indicates, that, the, slab, grave, people, were, the, primary, ancestors, of, the, xiongnu, and, that, the, xiongnu, formed, through, substantial, and, complex, admixture, with, west, eurasians, during, the, western, zhou, 1045, 771, bc, there, were, numerous, conflicts, with, nomadic, tribes, from, the, north, and, the, northwest, variously, known, as, the, xianyun, guifang, or, various, rong, tribes, such, as, the, xirong, shanrong, or, quanrong, these, tribes, are, recorded, as, harassing, zhou, territory, but, at, the, time, the, zhou, were, expanding, northwards, encroaching, on, their, traditional, lands, especially, into, the, wei, river, valley, archaeologically, the, zhou, expanded, to, the, north, and, the, northwest, at, the, expense, of, the, siwa, culture, the, quanrong, put, an, end, to, the, western, zhou, in, 771, bc, sacking, the, zhou, capital, of, haojing, and, killing, the, last, western, zhou, king, you, thereafter, the, task, of, dealing, with, the, northern, tribes, was, left, to, their, vassal, the, qin, state, to, the, west, the, pazyryk, culture, 6th, 3rd, century, bc, immediately, preceded, the, formation, of, the, xiongnus, a, scythian, culture, it, was, identified, by, excavated, artifacts, and, mummified, humans, such, as, the, siberian, ice, princess, found, in, the, siberian, permafrost, in, the, altay, mountains, kazakhstan, and, nearby, mongolia, to, the, south, the, ordos, culture, had, developed, in, the, ordos, loop, modern, inner, mongolia, china, during, the, bronze, and, early, iron, age, from, the, 6th, to, 2nd, centuries, bc, and, is, of, unknown, ethno, linguistic, origin, and, is, thought, to, represent, the, easternmost, extension, of, indo, european, speakers, the, yuezhi, were, displaced, by, the, xiongnu, expansion, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, and, had, to, migrate, to, central, and, southern, asia, western, han, historian, sima, qian, composed, an, early, yet, detailed, exposition, on, the, xiongnu, in, one, liezhuan, arrayed, account, of, his, records, of, the, grand, historian, c, 100, bc, wherein, the, xiongnu, were, alleged, to, be, descendants, of, a, certain, chunwei, who, in, turn, descended, from, the, lineage, of, lord, xia, a, k, a, yu, the, great, even, so, sima, qian, also, drew, a, distinct, line, between, the, settled, huaxia, people, han, to, the, pastoral, nomads, xiongnu, characterizing, them, as, two, polar, groups, in, the, sense, of, a, civilization, versus, an, uncivilized, society, the, hua, yi, distinction, sima, qian, also, mentioned, xiongnu, s, early, appearance, north, of, wild, goose, gate, and, dai, commanderies, before, 265, bce, just, before, the, zhao, xiongnu, war, however, sinologist, edwin, pulleyblank, 1994, contends, that, pre, 241, bce, references, to, the, xiongnu, are, anachronistic, substitutions, for, the, hu, people, instead, sometimes, the, xiongnu, were, distinguished, from, other, nomadic, peoples, namely, the, hu, people, yet, on, other, occasions, chinese, sources, often, just, classified, the, xiongnu, as, a, hu, people, which, was, a, blanket, term, for, nomadic, people, even, sima, qian, was, inconsistent, in, the, chapter, hereditary, house, of, zhao, he, considered, the, donghu, to, be, the, hu, proper, yet, elsewhere, he, considered, xiongnu, to, be, also, hu, ancient, china, often, came, in, contact, with, the, xianyun, and, the, xirong, nomadic, peoples, in, later, chinese, historiography, some, groups, of, these, peoples, were, believed, to, be, the, possible, progenitors, of, the, xiongnu, people, these, nomadic, people, often, had, repeated, military, confrontations, with, the, shang, and, especially, the, zhou, who, often, conquered, and, enslaved, the, nomads, in, an, expansion, drift, during, the, warring, states, period, the, armies, from, the, qin, zhao, and, yan, states, were, encroaching, and, conquering, various, nomadic, territories, that, were, inhabited, by, the, xiongnu, and, other, hu, peoples, the, zhao, xiongnu, war, is, a, notable, example, of, these, campaigns, pulleyblank, argued, that, the, xiongnu, were, part, of, a, xirong, group, called, yiqu, who, had, lived, in, shaanbei, and, had, been, influenced, by, china, for, centuries, before, they, were, driven, out, by, the, qin, dynasty, qin, s, campaign, against, the, xiongnu, expanded, qin, s, territory, at, the, expense, of, the, xiongnu, after, the, unification, of, qin, dynasty, xiongnu, was, a, threat, to, the, northern, board, of, qin, they, were, likely, to, attack, the, qin, dynasty, when, they, suffered, natural, disasters, the, first, known, xiongnu, leader, was, touman, who, reigned, between, 220, 209, bc, in, 215, bc, chinese, emperor, qin, shi, huang, sent, general, meng, tian, on, a, military, campaign, against, the, xiongnu, meng, tian, defeated, the, xiongnu, and, expelled, them, from, the, ordos, loop, forcing, touman, and, the, xiongnu, to, flee, north, into, the, mongolian, plateau, in, 210, bc, meng, tian, died, and, in, 209, bc, touman, s, son, modu, became, the, xiongnu, chanyu, in, order, to, protect, the, xiongnu, from, the, threat, of, the, qin, dynasty, modu, chanyu, united, the, xiongnu, into, a, powerful, confederation, this, transformed, the, xiongnu, into, a, more, formidable, polity, able, to, form, larger, armies, and, exercise, improved, strategic, coordination, two, years, later, in, 207, bc, the, qin, dynasty, fell, and, after, a, period, of, internal, conflict, it, was, replaced, by, the, western, han, dynasty, in, 202, bc, this, period, of, chinese, instability, was, a, time, of, prosperity, for, the, xiongnu, who, adopted, many, han, agriculture, techniques, such, as, slaves, for, heavy, labor, and, lived, in, han, style, homes, after, forging, internal, unity, modu, chanyu, expanded, the, xiongnu, empire, in, all, directions, to, the, north, he, conquered, a, number, of, nomadic, peoples, including, the, dingling, of, southern, siberia, he, crushed, the, power, of, the, donghu, people, of, eastern, mongolia, and, manchuria, as, well, as, the, yuezhi, in, the, hexi, corridor, of, gansu, where, his, son, jizhu, made, a, skull, cup, out, of, the, yuezhi, king, modu, also, retook, the, original,

new, power, was, met, with, a, policy, of, appeasement, by, emperor, guangwu, at, the, height, of, his, power, huduershi, even, compared, himself, to, his, illustrious, ancestor, modu, due, to, growing, regionalism, among, the, xiongnu, however, huduershi, was, never, able, to, establish, unquestioned, authority, in, contravention, of, a, principle, of, fraternal, succession, established, by, huhanye, huduershi, designated, his, son, punu, as, heir, apparent, however, as, the, eldest, son, of, the, preceding, chanyu, bi, pi, the, rizhu, king, of, the, right, had, a, more, legitimate, claim, consequently, bi, refused, to, attend, the, annual, meeting, at, the, chanyu, s, court, nevertheless, in, 46, ad, punu, ascended, the, throne, in, 48, ad, a, confederation, of, eight, xiongnu, tribes, in, bi, s, power, base, in, the, south, with, a, military, force, totalling, 40, 000, to, 50, 000, men, seceded, from, punu, s, kingdom, and, acclaimed, bi, as, chanyu, this, kingdom, became, known, as, the, southern, xiongnu, the, rump, kingdom, under, punu, around, the, orkhon, modern, north, central, mongolia, became, known, as, the, northern, xiongnu, punu, who, became, known, as, the, northern, chanyu, began, to, put, military, pressure, on, the, southern, xiongnu, in, 49, ad, tsi, yung, a, han, governor, of, liaodong, allied, with, the, wuhuan, and, xianbei, attacked, the, northern, xiongnu, the, northern, xiongnu, suffered, two, major, defeats, one, at, the, hands, of, the, xianbei, in, 85, ad, and, by, the, han, during, the, battle, of, ikh, bayan, in, 89, ad, the, northern, chanyu, fled, to, the, north, west, with, his, subjects, in, about, 155, ad, the, northern, xiongnu, were, decisively, crushed, and, subjugated, by, the, xianbei, according, to, the, fifth, century, book, of, wei, the, remnants, of, northern, chanyu, s, tribe, settled, as, yueban, near, kucha, and, subjugated, the, wusun, while, the, rest, fled, across, the, altai, mountains, towards, kangju, in, transoxania, it, states, that, this, group, later, became, the, hephthalites, coincidentally, the, southern, xiongnu, were, plagued, by, natural, disasters, and, misfortunes, in, addition, to, the, threat, posed, by, punu, consequently, in, 50, ad, the, southern, xiongnu, submitted, to, tributary, relations, with, han, china, the, system, of, tribute, was, considerably, tightened, by, the, han, to, keep, the, southern, xiongnu, under, control, the, chanyu, was, ordered, to, establish, his, court, in, the, meiji, district, of, xihe, commandery, and, the, southern, xiongnu, were, resettled, in, eight, frontier, commanderies, at, the, same, time, large, numbers, of, chinese, were, also, resettled, in, these, commanderies, in, mixed, han, xiongnu, settlements, economically, the, southern, xiongnu, became, reliant, on, trade, with, the, han, tensions, were, evident, between, han, settlers, and, practitioners, of, the, nomadic, way, of, life, thus, in, 94, anguo, chanyu, joined, forces, with, newly, subjugated, xiongnu, from, the, north, and, started, a, large, scale, rebellion, against, the, han, at, times, the, southern, xiongnu, would, join, forces, with, the, wuhuan, in, rebelling, and, receive, support, from, the, xianbei, outside, the, border, during, the, late, 2nd, century, ad, the, southern, xiongnu, were, drawn, into, the, rebellions, then, plaguing, the, han, court, in, 188, the, chanyu, sent, troops, to, help, the, han, suppress, a, rebellion, in, hebei, many, of, the, xiongnu, feared, that, it, would, set, a, precedent, for, unending, military, service, to, the, han, court, his, subjects, led, by, the, xiuchuge, clan, rebelled, first, killing, the, inspector, of, bing, province, and, then, the, chanyu, himself, his, son, yufuluo, entitled, chizhisizhu, succeeded, him, but, was, then, overthrown, by, the, same, rebellious, faction, in, 189, he, travelled, to, luoyang, the, han, capital, to, seek, aid, from, the, han, court, but, at, this, time, the, han, court, was, in, disorder, from, the, clash, between, grand, general, he, jin, and, the, eunuchs, and, the, intervention, of, the, warlord, dong, zhuo, the, chanyu, had, no, choice, but, to, settle, down, with, his, followers, in, pingyang, a, city, in, shanxi, in, 195, he, died, and, was, succeeded, as, chanyu, by, his, brother, huchuquan, meanwhile, the, rebels, initially, elected, a, marquis, of, the, xubu, clan, as, the, new, chanyu, but, after, his, death, a, nominal, king, was, put, in, his, place, in, the, 190s, the, xiuchuge, allied, themselves, with, the, heishan, bandits, of, the, taihang, mountains, before, retreating, west, as, the, warlords, cao, cao, and, yuan, shao, established, control, over, the, north, the, xiuchuge, were, eventually, defeated, by, cao, cao, in, 214, in, 215, 216, ad, the, warlord, statesman, cao, cao, detained, huchuquan, in, the, city, of, ye, and, divided, his, followers, in, shanxi, into, five, divisions, left, right, south, north, and, centre, the, office, of, chanyu, was, formally, abolished, and, the, southern, xiongnu, were, placed, under, the, supervision, of, yufuluo, s, brother, qubei, this, was, aimed, at, preventing, the, exiled, xiongnu, in, shanxi, from, engaging, in, rebellion, and, also, allowed, cao, cao, to, use, the, xiongnu, as, auxiliaries, in, his, cavalry, later, the, xiongnu, aristocracy, in, shanxi, changed, their, surname, from, luanti, to, liu, for, prestige, reasons, claiming, that, they, were, related, to, the, han, imperial, clan, through, the, old, intermarriage, policy, each, of, the, five, divisions, were, supervised, by, a, local, chief, who, in, turn, was, under, the, surveillance, of, a, chinese, resident, while, the, former, chanyu, was, in, semicaptivity, at, the, imperial, court, fang, xuanling, s, book, of, jin, lists, nineteen, xiongnu, tribes, that, resettled, within, the, great, wall, chuge, xianzhi, koutou, wutan, chile, hanzhi,

honored, and, prestigious, the, xiongnu, were, one, of, the, so, called, five, babarians, that, dominated, northern, china, during, the, sixteen, kingdoms, period, they, founded, the, han, zhao, and, helian, xia, dynasties, and, while, the, northern, liang, dynasty, was, established, by, the, lushuihu, people, it, is, sometimes, categorized, in, more, recent, historiography, as, a, xiongnu, state, shi, le, the, founder, of, the, later, zhao, dynasty, was, a, descendant, of, the, qiangqu, clan, although, by, his, time, he, and, his, people, had, become, a, distinct, ethnic, group, known, as, the, jie, despite, cao, cao, s, effort, the, southern, xiongnu, in, shanxi, eventually, grew, restless, and, attempted, to, restore, themselves, to, power, the, five, divisions, were, briefly, unified, under, liu, bao, during, the, mid, 3rd, century, before, the, cao, wei, and, western, jin, courts, intervened, and, forced, them, back, into, five, during, the, early, jin, period, the, xiongnu, began, staging, revolts, and, leaving, the, great, wall, but, it, would, not, be, until, 304, amidst, the, war, of, the, eight, princes, that, weakened, the, jin, power, in, northern, china, that, they, made, a, crucial, breakthrough, liu, yuan, the, son, of, liu, bao, and, a, general, serving, under, one, of, the, jin, princes, was, offered, by, the, xiongnu, to, become, the, leader, of, their, rebellion, after, deceiving, his, prince, liu, yuan, returned, to, the, xiongnu, and, was, acclaimed, as, the, grand, chanyu, later, that, year, he, declared, himself, the, king, of, han, records, indicate, that, liu, yuan, and, his, family, members, were, actually, from, the, chuge, tribe, but, he, claimed, himself, to, be, a, direct, descendant, of, the, southern, xiongnu, chanyus, and, depicted, his, state, as, a, continuation, of, the, han, dynasty, citing, that, his, alleged, ancestors, were, married, to, han, princesses, through, heqin, he, allowed, the, han, chinese, and, non, xiongnu, tribes, like, the, xianbei, wuhuan, and, di, to, serve, under, him, and, in, 308, he, elevated, his, title, to, emperor, of, han, the, western, jin, devastated, by, war, and, natural, disasters, was, unable, to, stop, the, growing, threat, of, han, even, more, so, after, the, ascension, of, liu, cong, to, the, han, throne, in, 311, the, jin, imperial, army, was, annihilated, by, han, forces, and, shortly, after, the, jin, capital, luoyang, was, sacked, and, emperor, huai, was, captured, in, an, event, known, as, the, disaster, of, yongjia, in, 316, the, jin, restoration, in, chang, an, headed, by, emperor, min, was, also, crushed, by, han, after, the, fall, of, chang, an, the, remnants, of, jin, survived, in, the, south, at, jiankang, as, the, eastern, jin, dynasty, although, han, enjoyed, military, success, it, also, suffered, from, internal, strife, under, liu, cong, throughout, his, reign, liu, cong, faced, constant, dissidence, from, his, own, ministers, and, so, he, empowered, his, consort, kins, and, eunuchs, to, counter, them, the, han, court, fell, into, a, power, struggle, which, ended, in, a, bloody, purge, of, the, government, liu, cong, also, failed, to, constrain, shi, le, a, general, of, jie, ethnicity, who, effectively, held, the, eastern, parts, of, the, empire, after, liu, cong, s, death, in, 318, his, consort, kin, jin, zhun, massacred, the, emperor, and, a, large, portion, of, the, aristocracy, before, being, defeated, by, a, combined, force, led, by, liu, cong, s, cousin, liu, yao, and, shi, le, amidst, jin, zhun, s, rebellion, the, han, loyalists, that, escaped, the, massacre, acclaimed, liu, yao, as, the, new, emperor, in, 319, he, moved, the, capital, from, pingyang, to, chang, an, and, renamed, the, dynasty, as, zhao, unlike, his, predecessors, liu, yao, appealed, more, to, his, xiongnu, ancestry, by, honouring, modu, chanyu, and, distancing, himself, from, the, state, s, initial, positioning, of, restoring, the, han, dynasty, however, this, was, not, a, break, from, liu, yuan, as, he, continued, to, honor, liu, yuan, and, liu, cong, posthumously, it, is, hence, known, to, historians, collectively, as, han, zhao, that, same, year, shi, le, proclaimed, independence, and, formed, his, own, state, of, zhao, challenging, liu, yao, for, hegemony, over, northern, china, for, this, reason, han, zhao, is, also, known, to, historians, as, the, former, zhao, to, distinguish, it, from, shi, le, s, later, zhao, liu, yao, retained, control, over, the, guanzhong, region, and, expanded, his, domain, westward, by, campaigning, against, remnants, of, the, jin, former, liang, and, chouchi, eventually, liu, yao, led, his, army, to, fight, later, zhao, for, control, over, luoyang, but, was, captured, by, shi, le, s, forces, in, battle, and, executed, in, 329, chang, an, soon, fell, to, later, zhao, and, the, last, of, former, zhao, s, forces, were, destroyed, thus, ended, the, han, zhao, dynasty, northern, china, would, be, dominated, by, the, later, zhao, for, the, next, 20, years, the, chieftains, of, the, tiefu, tribe, were, descendants, of, qubei, and, were, related, to, another, tribe, the, dugu, based, on, their, name, which, meant, a, person, whose, father, was, a, xiongnu, and, mother, was, a, xianbei, the, tiefu, had, intermingled, with, the, xianbei, and, records, sometimes, refer, to, them, as, wuhuan, which, by, the, 4th, century, had, become, synonymous, with, mixed, barbarians, or, zahu, in, 309, their, chieftain, liu, hu, staged, a, revolt, against, the, western, jin, from, shanxi, but, was, driven, out, to, shuofang, commandery, in, the, ordos, loop, the, tiefu, resided, there, for, most, of, their, existence, often, as, a, vassal, to, their, stronger, neighbours, before, their, power, was, destroyed, by, the, northern, wei, dynasty, in, 392, liu, bobo, a, surviving, member, of, the, tiefu, went, into, exile, and, eventually, offered, his, services, to, the, qiang, led, later, qin, he, was, assigned, to, guard, shuofang, but, in, 407, angered, by, qin, holding, peace, talks, with, the, northern, wei, he, rebelled, and, founded, a, state, known, as, the, helian, xia, dynasty, bobo, strongly, affirmed, his, xiongnu, lineage, his, state, name, of, xia, was, based, on, the, claim, that, the, xiongnu, were, descendants, of, the, xia, dynasty, and, he, later, changed, his, family, name, from, liu, to, the, more, xiongnu, like, helian, believing, it, inappropriate, to, follow, his, matrilineal, line, from, the, han, helian, bobo, placed, the, later, qin, in, a, perpetual, state, of, warfare, and, greatly, contributed, to, its, decline, in, 418, he, conquered, the, guanzhong, region, from, the, eastern, jin, dynasty, after, jin, destroyed, qin, the, previous, year, after, helian, bobo, s, death, in, 425, the, xia, quickly, declined, due, to, pressure, from, the, northern, wei, in, 428, the, emperor, helian, chang, and, capital, were, both, captured, by, wei, forces, his, brother, helian, ding, succeeded, him, and, conquered, the, western, qin, in, 431, but, that, same, year, he, was, ambushed, and, imprisoned, by, the, tuyuhun, while, attempting, a, campaign, against, northern, liang, the, xia, was, at, its, end, and, the, following, year, helian, ding, was, sent, to, wei, where, he, was, executed, tongwancheng, meaning, unite, all, nations, was, one, of, the, capitals, of, the, xia, that, was, built, during, the, reign, of, helian, bobo, the, ruined, city, was, discovered, in, 1996, and, the, state, council, designated, it, as, a, cultural, relic, under, top, state, protection, the, repair, of, the, yong, an, platform, where, helian, bobo, reviewed, parading, troops, has, been, finished, and, restoration, on, the, 31, meter, tall, turret, follows, the, juqu, clan, were, a, lushuihu, family, that, founded, the, northern, liang, dynasty, in, modern, day, gansu, in, 397, recent, historiographies, often, classify, the, northern, liang, as, a, xiongnu, state, but, there, is, still, ongoing, debate, on, the, exact, origin, of, the, lushuihu, a, leading, theory, is, that, the, lushuihu, were, descendants, of, the, lesser, yuezhi, that, had, intermingled, with, the, qiang, people, but, based, on, the, fact, that, the, juqu, s, ancestors, once, served, the, xiongnu, empire, the, lushuihu, could, still, be, considered, a, branch, of, the, xiongnu, regardless, contemporaneous, records, treat, the, lushuihu, as, a, distinct, ethnic, group, the, northern, liang, was, known, for, its, propagation, of, buddhism, in, gansu, through, their, construction, of, buddhist, sites, such, as, the, tiantishan, and, mogao, caves, and, for, being, the, last, of, the, so, called, sixteen, kingdoms, after, it, was, conquered, by, the, northern, wei, dynasty, in, 439, there, was, also, the, northern, liang, of, gaochang, which, existed, between, 442, and, 460, the, xiongnu, confederation, was, unusually, long, lived, for, a, steppe, empire, the, purpose, of, raiding, the, central, plain, was, not, simply, for, goods, but, to, force, the, central, plain, polity, to, pay, regular, tribute, the, power, of, the, xiongnu, ruler, was, based, on, his, control, of, han, tribute, which, he, used, to, reward, his, supporters, the, han, and, xiongnu, empires, rose, at, the, same, time, because, the, xiongnu, state, depended, on, han, tribute, a, major, xiongnu, weakness, was, the, custom, of, lateral, succession, if, a, dead, ruler, s, son, was, not, old, enough, to, take, command, power, passed, to, the, late, ruler, s, brother, this, worked, in, the, first, generation, but, could, lead, to, civil, war, in, the, second, generation, the, first, time, this, happened, in, 60, bc, the, weaker, party, adopted, what, barfield, calls, the, inner, frontier, strategy, they, moved, south, and, submitted, to, the, dominant, central, plain, regime, and, then, used, the, resources, obtained, from, their, overlord, to, defeat, the, northern, xiongnu, and, re, establish, the, empire, the, second, time, this, happened, about, 47, ad, the, strategy, failed, the, southern, ruler, was, unable, to, defeat, the, northern, ruler, and, the, xiongnu, remained, divided, the, xiongnu, empire, is, widely, thought, to, have, been, multiethnic, there, are, several, theories, on, the, ethnolinguistic, identity, of, the, xiongnu, though, there, is, no, consensus, among, scholars, as, to, what, language, was, spoken, by, the, xiongnu, elite, the, xiongnu, hun, hypothesis, was, originally, proposed, by, the, 18th, century, french, historian, joseph, de, guignes, who, noticed, that, ancient, chinese, scholars, had, referred, to, members, of, tribes, which, were, associated, with, the, xiongnu, by, names, which, were, similar, to, the, name, hun, albeit, with, varying, chinese, characters, tienne, de, la, vaissi, re, has, shown, that, in, the, sogdian, script, used, in, the, so, called, sogdian, ancient, letters, both, the, xiongnu, and, the, huns, were, referred, to, as, the, wn, xwn, which, indicates, that, the, two, names, were, synonymous, although, the, theory, that, the, xiongnu, were, the, precursors, of, the, huns, as, they, were, later, known, in, europe, is, now, accepted, by, many, scholars, it, has, yet, to, become, a, consensus, view, the, identification, with, the, huns, may, either, be, incorrect, or, it, may, be, an, oversimplification, as, would, appear, to, be, the, case, with, a, proto, mongol, people, the, rouran, who, have, sometimes, been, linked, to, the, avars, of, central, europe, most, scholars, agree, that, the, xiongnu, elite, may, have, been, initially, of, sogdian, origin, while, later, switching, to, a, turkic, language, harold, walter, bailey, proposed, an, iranian, origin, of, the, xiongnu, recognizing, all, of, the, earliest, xiongnu, names, of, the, 2nd, century, bc, as, being, of, the, iranian, type, central, asian, scholar, christopher, i, beckwith, notes, that, the, xiongnu, name, could, be, a, cognate, of, scythian, saka, and, sogdia, corresponding, to, a, name, for, eastern, iranian, scythians, according, to, beckwith, the, xiongnu, could, have, contained, a, leading, iranian, component, when, they, started, out, but, more, likely, they, had, earlier, been, subjects, of, an, iranian, people, and, learned, the, iranian, nomadic, model, from, them, in, the, 1994, unesco, published, history, of, civilizations, of, central, asia, its, editor, j, nos, harmatta, claims, that, the, royal, tribes, and, kings, of, the, xiongnu, bore, iranian, names, that, all, xiongnu, words, noted, by, the, chinese, can, be, explained, from, a, scythian, language, and, that, it, is, therefore, clear, that, the, majority, of, xiongnu, tribes, spoke, an, eastern, iranian, language, according, to, a, study, by, alexander, savelyev, and, choongwon, jeong, published, in, 2020, in, the, journal, evolutionary, human, sciences, by, cambridge, university, press, the, predominant, part, of, the, xiongnu, population, is, likely, to, have, spoken, turkic, however, important, cultural, technological, and, political, elements, may, have, been, transmitted, by, eastern, iranian, speaking, steppe, nomads, arguably, these, iranian, speaking, groups, were, assimilated, over, time, by, the, predominant, turkic, speaking, part, of, the, xiongnu, population, lajos, ligeti, was, the, first, to, suggest, that, the, xiongnu, spoke, a, yeniseian, language, in, the, early, 1960s, edwin, pulleyblank, was, the, first, to, expand, upon, this, idea, with, credible, evidence, the, yeniseian, theory, proposes, that, the, jie, a, western, xiongnu, people, spoke, a, yeniseian, language, hyun, jin, kim, notes, that, the, 7th, ad, chinese, conpendium, jin, shu, contains, a, transliterated, song, of, jie, origin, which, appears, to, be, yeniseian, this, song, has, led, researchers, pulleyblank, and, vovin, to, argue, for, a, yeniseian, jie, dominant, minority, that, ruled, over, the, other, xiongnu, ethnicities, like, iranian, and, turkic, people, kim, has, stated, that, the, dominant, xiongnu, language, was, likely, turkic, or, yeniseian, but, has, cautioned, that, the, xiongnu, were, definitely, a, multi, ethnic, society, pulleybank, and, d, n, keightley, asserted, that, the, xiongnu, titles, were, originally, siberian, words, but, were, later, borrowed, by, the, turkic, and, mongolic, peoples, titles, such, as, tarqan, tegin, and, kaghan, were, also, inherited, from, the, xiongnu, language, and, are, possibly, of, yeniseian, origin, for, example, the, xiongnu, word, for, heaven, is, theorized, to, come, from, proto, yeniseian, t, vr, vocabulary, from, xiongnu, inscriptions, sometimes, appears, to, have, yeniseian, cognates, which, were, used, by, vovin, to, support, his, theory, that, the, xiongnu, has, a, large, yeniseian, component, examples, of, proposed, cognates, include, words, such, as, xiongnu, k, ala, son, and, ket, qalek, younger, son, xiongnu, sakdak, boot, and, ket, sagdi, boot, xiongnu, g, awa, prince, and,

appear, to, have, clusters, with, r, and, l, in, the, beginning, of, the, word, it, is, unlikely, to, be, of, turkic, origin, and, instead, believed, that, most, vocabulary, we, have, mostly, resemble, yeniseian, languages, alexander, vovin, also, wrote, that, some, names, of, horses, in, the, xiongnu, language, appear, to, be, turkic, words, with, yeniseian, prefixes, an, analysis, by, savelyev, and, jeong, 2020, has, cast, doubt, on, the, yeniseian, theory, if, assuming, that, the, ancient, yeniseians, were, represented, by, modern, ket, people, who, are, more, genetically, similar, to, samoyedic, speakers, the, xiongnu, do, not, display, a, genetic, affinity, for, yeniseian, peoples, a, review, by, wilson, 2023, argues, that, the, presence, of, yeniseian, speakers, among, the, multi, ethnic, xiongnu, should, not, be, rejected, and, that, yeniseian, speaking, peoples, must, have, played, a, more, prominent, than, heretofore, recognized, role, in, the, history, of, eurasia, during, the, first, millennium, of, the, common, era, according, to, a, study, by, alexander, savelyev, and, choongwon, jeong, published, in, 2020, in, the, journal, evolutionary, human, sciences, by, cambridge, university, press, the, predominant, part, of, the, xiongnu, population, is, likely, to, have, spoken, turkic, however, genetic, studies, found, a, mixture, of, haplogroups, from, western, and, eastern, eurasian, origins, that, suggested, a, large, genetic, diversity, within, and, possibly, multiple, origins, of, xiongnu, elites, the, turkic, related, component, may, be, brought, by, eastern, eurasian, genetic, substratum, other, proponents, of, a, turkic, language, theory, include, e, h, parker, jean, pierre, abel, r, musat, julius, klaproth, gustaf, john, ramstedt, annemarie, von, gabain, and, charles, hucker, andr, wink, states, that, the, xiongnu, probably, spoke, an, early, form, of, turkic, even, if, xiongnu, were, not, turks, nor, turkic, speaking, they, were, in, close, contact, with, turkic, speakers, very, early, on, craig, benjamin, sees, the, xiongnu, as, either, proto, turks, or, proto, mongols, who, possibly, spoke, a, language, related, to, the, dingling, chinese, sources, link, several, turkic, peoples, to, the, xiongnu, however, chinese, sources, also, ascribe, xiongnu, origins, to, the, para, mongolic, speaking, kumo, xi, and, khitans, mongolian, and, other, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, xiongnu, spoke, a, language, related, to, the, mongolic, languages, mongolian, archaeologists, proposed, that, the, slab, grave, culture, people, were, the, ancestors, of, the, xiongnu, and, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, xiongnu, may, have, been, the, ancestors, of, the, mongols, nikita, bichurin, considered, xiongnu, and, xianbei, to, be, two, subgroups, or, dynasties, of, but, one, same, ethnicity, according, to, the, book, of, song, the, rourans, whom, book, of, wei, identified, as, offspring, of, proto, mongolic, donghu, people, possessed, the, alternative, name, s, d, t, n, tatar, and, or, t, nt, n, tartar, and, according, to, book, of, liang, they, also, constituted, a, separate, branch, of, the, xiongnu, old, book, of, tang, mentioned, twenty, shiwei, tribes, whom, other, chinese, sources, book, of, sui, new, book, of, tang, associated, with, the, khitans, another, people, who, in, turn, descended, from, the, xianbei, and, were, also, associated, with, the, xiongnu, while, the, xianbei, khitans, and, shiwei, are, generally, believed, to, be, predominantly, mongolic, and, para, mongolic, speaking, yet, xianbei, were, stated, to, descend, from, the, donghu, whom, sima, qian, distinguished, from, the, xiongnu, notwithstanding, sima, qian, s, inconsistency, additionally, chinese, chroniclers, routinely, ascribed, xiongnu, origins, to, various, nomadic, groups, for, examples, xiongnu, ancestry, was, ascribed, to, para, mongolic, speaking, kumo, xi, as, well, as, turkic, speaking, g, kt, rks, and, tiele, genghis, khan, refers, to, the, time, of, modu, chanyu, as, the, remote, times, of, our, chanyu, in, his, letter, to, daoist, qiu, chuji, sun, and, moon, symbol, of, xiongnu, that, discovered, by, archaeologists, is, similar, to, mongolian, soyombo, symbol, since, the, early, 19th, century, a, number, of, western, scholars, have, proposed, a, connection, between, various, language, families, or, subfamilies, and, the, language, or, languages, of, the, xiongnu, albert, terrien, de, lacouperie, considered, them, to, be, multi, component, groups, many, scholars, believe, the, xiongnu, confederation, was, a, mixture, of, different, ethno, linguistic, groups, and, that, their, main, language, as, represented, in, the, chinese, sources, and, its, relationships, have, not, yet, been, satisfactorily, determined, kim, rejects, old, racial, theories, or, even, ethnic, affiliations, in, favour, of, the, historical, reality, of, these, extensive, multiethnic, polyglot, steppe, empires, chinese, sources, link, the, tiele, people, and, ashina, to, the, xiongnu, not, all, turkic, peoples, according, to, the, book, of, zhou, and, the, history, of, the, northern, dynasties, the, ashina, clan, was, a, component, of, the, xiongnu, confederation, but, this, connection, is, disputed, and, according, to, the, book, of, sui, and, the, tongdian, they, were, mixed, nomads, traditional, chinese, simplified, chinese, pinyin, z, h, from, pingliang, the, ashina, and, tiele, may, have, been, separate, ethnic, groups, who, mixed, with, the, xiongnu, indeed, chinese, sources, link, many, nomadic, peoples, hu, see, wu, hu, on, their, northern, borders, to, the, xiongnu, just, as, greco, roman, historiographers, called, avars, and, huns, scythians, the, greek, cognate, of, tourkia, greek, was, used, by, the, byzantine, emperor, and, scholar, constantine, vii, porphyrogenitus, in, his, book, de, administrando, imperio, though, in, his, use, turks, always, referred, to, magyars, such, archaizing, was, a, common, literary, topos, and, implied, similar, geographic, origins, and, nomadic, lifestyle, but, not, direct, filiation, some, uyghurs, claimed, descent, from, the, xiongnu, according, to, chinese, history, weishu, the, founder, of, the, uyghur, khaganate, was, descended, from, a, xiongnu, ruler, but, many, contemporary, scholars, do, not, consider, the, modern, uyghurs, to, be, of, direct, linear, descent, from, the, old, uyghur, khaganate, because, modern, uyghur, language, and, old, uyghur, languages, are, different, rather, they, consider, them, to, be, descendants, of, a, number, of, people, one, of, them, the, ancient, uyghurs, in, various, kinds, of, ancient, inscriptions, on, monuments, of, munmu, of, silla, it, is, recorded, that, king, munmu, had, xiongnu, ancestry, according, to, several, historians, it, is, possible, that, there, were, tribes, of, koreanic, origin, there, are, also, some, korean, researchers, that, point, out, that, the, grave, goods, of, silla, and, of, the, eastern, xiongnu, are, alike, turkologist, gerhard, doerfer, has, denied, any, possibility, of, a, relationship, between, the, xiongnu, language, and, any, other, known, language, even, any, connection, with, turkic, or, mongolian, the, original, geographic, location, of, the, xiongnu, is, disputed, among, steppe, archaeologists, since, the, 1960s, the, geographic, origin, of, the, xiongnu, has, attempted, to, be, traced, through, an, analysis, of, early, iron, age, burial, constructions, no, region, has, been, proven, to, have, mortuary, practices, that, clearly, match, those, of, the, xiongnu, in, the, 1920s, pyotr, kozlov, oversaw, the, excavation, of, royal, tombs, at, the, noin, ula, burial, site, in, northern, mongolia, dated, to, around, the, first, century, ce, other, xiongnu, sites, have, been, unearthed, in, inner, mongolia, such, as, the, ordos, culture, sinologist, otto, maenchen, helfen, has, said, that, depictions, of, the, xiongnu, of, transbaikalia, and, the, ordos, commonly, show, individuals, with, west, eurasian, features, iaroslav, lebedynsky, said, that, west, eurasian, depictions, in, the, ordos, region, should, be, attributed, to, a, scythian, affinity, portraits, found, in, the, noin, ula, excavations, demonstrate, other, cultural, evidences, and, influences, showing, that, chinese, and, xiongnu, art, have, influenced, each, other, mutually, some, of, these, embroidered, portraits, in, the, noin, ula, kurgans, also, depict, the, xiongnu, with, long, braided, hair, with, wide, ribbons, which, is, seen, to, be, identical, with, the, ashina, clan, hair, style, well, preserved, bodies, in, xiongnu, and, pre, xiongnu, tombs, in, the, mongolian, republic, and, southern, siberia, show, both, east, asian, and, west, eurasian, features, analysis, of, cranial, remains, from, some, sites, attributed, to, the, xiongnu, have, revealed, that, they, had, dolichocephalic, skulls, with, east, asian, craniometrical, features, setting, them, apart, from, neighboring, populations, in, present, day, mongolia, russian, and, chinese, anthropological, and, craniofacial, studies, show, that, the, xiongnu, were, physically, very, heterogenous, with, six, different, population, clusters, showing, different, degrees, of, west, eurasian, and, east, asian, physical, traits, presently, there, exist, four, fully, excavated, and, well, documented, cemeteries, ivolga, dyrestui, burkhan, tolgoi, and, daodunzi, additionally, thousands, of, tombs, have, been, recorded, in, transbaikalia, and, mongolia, the, archaeologists, have, chosen, to, for, the, most, part, refrain, from, positing, anything, about, han, xiongnu, relations, based, on, the, material, excavated, however, they, were, willing, to, mention, the, following, there, is, no, clear, indication, of, the, ethnicity, of, this, tomb, occupant, but, in, a, similar, brick, chambered, tomb, of, the, late, eastern, han, period, at, the, same, cemetery, archaeologists, discovered, a, bronze, seal, with, the, official, title, that, the, han, government, bestowed, upon, the, leader, of, the, xiongnu, the, excavators, suggested, that, these, brick, chamber, tombs, all, belong, to, the, xiongnu, qinghai, 1993, classifications, of, these, burial, sites, make, distinction, between, two, prevailing, type, of, burials, 1, monumental, ramped, terrace, tombs, which, are, often, flanked, by, smaller, satellite, burials, and, 2, circular, or, ring, burials, some, scholars, consider, this, a, division, between, elite, graves, and, commoner, graves, other, scholars, find, this, division, too, simplistic, and, not, evocative, of, a, true, distinction, because, it, shows, ignorance, of, the, nature, of, the, mortuary, investments, and, typically, luxuriant, burial, assemblages, the, discovery, of, other, lesser, interments, that, do, not, qualify, as, either, of, these, types, a, 2003, study, found, that, 89, of, xiongnu, maternal, lineages, are, of, east, asian, origin, while, 11, were, of, west, eurasian, origin, however, a, 2016, study, found, that, 37, 5, of, xiongnu, maternal, lineages, were, west, eurasian, in, a, central, mongolian, sample, according, to, rogers, kaestle, 2022, these, studies, make, clear, that, the, xiongnu, population, is, extremely, similar, to, the, preceding, slab, grave, population, which, had, a, similar, frequency, of, eastern, and, western, maternal, haplogroups, supporting, a, hypothesis, of, continuity, from, the, slab, grave, period, to, the, xiongnu, they, wrote, that, the, bulk, of, the, genetics, research, indicates, that, roughly, 27, of, xiongnu, maternal, haplogroups, were, of, west, eurasian, origin, while, the, rest, were, east, asian, some, examples, of, maternal, haplogroups, observed, in, xiongnu, specimens, include, d4b2b4, n9a2a, g3a3, d4a6, and, d4b2b2b, and, u2e1, according, to, rogers, kaestle, 2022, roughly, 47, of, xiongnu, period, remains, belonged, to, paternal, haplogroups, associated, with, modern, west, eurasians, while, the, rest, 53, belonged, to, east, asian, haplogroups, they, observed, that, this, contrasts, strongly, with, the, preceding, slab, grave, period, which, was, dominated, by, east, asian, patrilineages, they, suggest, that, this, may, reflect, an, aggressive, expansion, of, people, with, west, eurasian, paternal, haplogroups, or, perhaps, the, practice, of, marriage, alliances, or, cultural, networks, favoring, people, with, western, patrilines, some, examples, of, paternal, haplogroups, in, xiongnu, specimens, include, q1b, c3, r1, r1b, o3a, and, o3a3b2, r1a1a1b2a, z94, r1a1a1b2a2, z2124, q1a, n1a, j2a, j1a, and, e1b1b1a, according, to, lee, kuang, the, main, paternal, lineages, of, 62, xiongnu, elite, remains, in, the, egiin, gol, valley, belonged, to, the, paternal, haplogroups, n1c1, q, m242, and, c, m217, one, sample, from, duurlig, nars, belongrd, to, r1a1, and, another, to, c, m217, xiongnu, remains, from, barkol, belonged, exclusively, to, haplogroup, q, they, argue, that, the, haplogroups, c2, q, and, n, likely, formed, the, major, paternal, haplogroups, of, the, xiongnu, tribes, while, r1a, was, the, most, common, paternal, haplogroup, 44, 5, among, neighbouring, nomads, from, the, altai, mountain, who, were, probably, incorporated, into, the, xiongnu, confederation, and, may, be, associated, with, the, jie, people, a, study, published, in, the, american, journal, of, physical, anthropology, in, october, 2006, detected, significant, genetic, continuity, between, the, examined, individuals, at, egyin, gol, and, modern, mongolians, a, genetic, study, published, in, nature, in, may, 2018, examined, the, remains, of, five, xiongnu, the, study, concluded, that, xiongnu, confederation, was, genetically, heterogeneous, and, xiongnu, individuals, belonging, to, two, distinct, groups, one, being, of, primarily, east, asian, origin, associated, with, the, earlier, slab, grave, culture, and, the, other, presenting, considerable, admixture, levels, with, west, eurasian, possibly, from, central, saka, sources, the, evidence, suggested, that, the, huns, probably, emerged, through, minor, male, driven, geneflow, into, the, saka, through, westward, migrations, of, the, xiongnu, a, study, published, in, november, 2020, examined, 60, early, and, late, xiongnu, individuals, from, across, of, mongolia, the, study, found, that, the, xiongnu, resulted, from, the, admixture, of, three, different, clusters, from, the, mongolian, region, the, two, early, genetic, clusters, are, early, xiongnu, west, from, the, altai, mountains, formed, at, 92, by, the, hybrid, eurasian, chandman, ancestry, and, 8, bmac, ancestry, and, early, xiongnu, rest, from, the, mongolian, plateau, individuals, with, primarily, ulaanzuukh, slab, grave, ancestry, or, mixed, with, early, xiongnu, west, the, later, third, cluster, named, late, xiongnu, has, even, higher, heterogenity, with, the, continued, combination, of, chandman, and, ulaanzuukh, slab, grave, ancestry, and, additional, geneflow, from, sarmatian, and, han, chinese, sources, their, uniparental, haplogroup, assignments, also, showed, heterogenetic, influence, on, their, ethnogenesis, as, well, as, their, connection, with, huns, in, contrast, the, later, mongols, had, a, much, higher, eastern, eurasian, ancestry, as, a, whole, similar, to, that, of, modern, day, mongolic, speaking, populations, a, xiongnu, remain, gd1, 4, analysed, in, a, 2024, study, was, found, to, be, entirely, derived, from, ancient, northeast, asians, without, any, west, eurasian, associated, ancestry, the, sample, clustered, closely, with, a, g, kt, rk, remain, gd1, 1, from, the, later, turkic, period, although, the, xiongnu, were, ethnically, heterogeneous, as, a, whole, it, appears, that, variability, was, highly, related, to, social, status, genetic, heterogeneity, was, highest, among, retainers, of, low, status, as, identified, by, their, smaller, and, peripheral, tombs, these, retainers, mainly, displayed, ancestry, related, to, the, chandman, uyuk, culture, characterized, by, a, hybrid, eurasian, gene, pool, combining, the, genetic, profile, of, the, sintashta, culture, and, baikal, hunter, gatherers, baikal, eba, or, various, combinations, of, chandman, uyuk, and, ancient, northeast, asian, ulaanzuukh, slab, grave, profiles, on, the, contrary, high, status, xiongnu, individuals, tended, to, have, less, genetic, diversity, and, their, ancestry, was, essentially, derived, from, the, eastern, eurasian, ulaanzuukh, slab, grave, culture, or, alternatively, from, the, xianbei, suggesting, multiple, sources, for, their, eastern, ancestry, high, eastern, ancestry, was, more, common, among, high, status, female, samples, while, low, status, male, samples, tended, to, be, more, diverse, and, having, higher, western, ancestry, a, likely, chanyu, a, male, ruler, of, the, empire, identified, by, his, prestigious, tomb, was, shown, to, have, had, similar, ancestry, as, a, high, status, female, in, the, western, frontiers, deriving, about, 39, 3, slab, grave, or, ancient, northeast, asian, genetic, ancestry, 51, 9, han, or, yellow, river, farmers, ancestry, with, the, rest, 8, 8, being, saka, chandman, ancestry, within, the, xiongnu, culture, more, variety, is, visible, from, site, to, site, than, from, era, to, era, in, terms, of, the, chinese, chronology, yet, all, form, a, whole, that, is, distinct, from, that, of, the, han, and, other, peoples, of, the, non, chinese, north, in, some, instances, the, iconography, cannot, be, used, as, the, main, cultural, identifier, because, art, depicting, animal, predation, is, common, among, the, steppe, peoples, an, example, of, animal, predation, associated, with, xiongnu, culture, is, that, of, a, tiger, carrying, dead, prey, a, similar, motif, appears, in, work, from, maoqinggou, a, site, which, is, presumed, to, have, been, under, xiongnu, political, control, but, is, still, clearly, non, xiongnu, in, the, maoqinggou, example, the, prey, is, replaced, with, an, extension, of, the, tiger, s, foot, the, work, also, depicts, a, cruder, level, of, execution, maoqinggou, work, was, executed, in, a, rounder, less, detailed, style, in, its, broadest, sense, xiongnu, iconography, of, animal, predation, includes, examples, such, as, the, gold, headdress, from, aluchaideng, and, gold, earrings, with, a, turquoise, and, jade, inlay, discovered, in, xigoupan, inner, mongolia, xiongnu, art, is, harder, to, distinguish, from, saka, or, scythian, art, there, is, a, similarity, present, in, stylistic, execution, but, xiongnu, art, and, saka, art, often, differ, in, terms, of, iconography, saka, art, does, not, appear, to, have, included, predation, scenes, especially, with, dead, prey, or, same, animal, combat, additionally, saka, art, included, elements, not, common, to, xiongnu, iconography, such, as, winged, horned, horses, the, two, cultures, also, used, two, different, kinds, of, bird, heads, xiongnu, depictions, of, birds, tend, to, have, a, medium, sized, eye, and, beak, and, they, are, also, depicted, with, ears, while, saka, birds, have, a, pronounced, eye, and, beak, and, no, ears, some, scholars, claim, these, differences, are, indicative, of, cultural, differences, scholar, sophia, karin, psarras, suggests, that, xiongnu, images, of, animal, predation, specifically, tiger, and, prey, are, spiritual, representative, of, death, and, rebirth, and, that, same, animal, combat, is, representative, of, the, acquisition, or, maintenance, of, power, the, rock, art, of, the, yin, and, helan, mountains, is, dated, from, the, 9th, millennium, bc, to, the, 19th, century, ad, it, consists, mainly, of, engraved, signs, petroglyphs, and, only, minimally, of, painted, images, chinese, sources, indicate, that, the, xiongnu, did, not, have, an, ideographic, form, of, writing, like, chinese, but, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, a, renegade, chinese, dignitary, yue, taught, the, shanyu, to, write, official, letters, to, the, chinese, court, on, a, wooden, tablet, 31, cm, long, and, to, use, a, seal, and, large, sized, folder, the, same, sources, tell, that, when, the, xiongnu, noted, down, something, or, transmitted, a, message, they, made, cuts, on, a, piece, of, wood, ke, mu, and, they, also, mention, a, hu, script, vol, 110, at, noin, ula, and, other, xiongnu, burial, sites, in, mongolia, and, the, region, north, of, lake, baikal, among, the, objects, discovered, during, excavations, conducted, between, 1924, and, 1925, were, over, 20, carved, characters, most, of, these, characters, are, either, identical, or, very, similar, to, letters, of, the, old, turkic, alphabet, of, the, early, middle, ages, found, on, the, eurasian, steppes, from, this, some, specialists, conclude, that, the, xiongnu, used, a, script, similar, to, the, ancient, eurasian, runiform, and, that, this, alphabet, was, a, basis, for, later, turkic, writing, according, to, the, book, of, han, the, xiongnu, called, heaven, ch, ngl, a, chinese, transcription, of, tengri, the, xiongnu, were, a, nomadic, people, from, their, lifestyle, of, herding, flocks, and, their, horse, trade, with, china, it, can, be, concluded, that, their, diet, consist, mainly, of, mutton, horse, meat, and, wild, geese, that, were, shot, down, historical, evidence, gives, reason, to, believe, that, from, the, 2nd, century, bc, proto, mongol, peoples, the, xiongnu, xianbei, and, khitans, were, familiar, with, buddhism, on, the, territory, of, the, ivolginsk, settlement, remains, of, buddhist, prayer, beads, were, found, in, a, xiongnu, grave
