determination, within, the, territory, of, the, former, mandatory, palestine, key, aspects, of, the, conflict, include, the, israeli, occupation, of, the, west, bank, and, gaza, strip, the, status, of, jerusalem, israeli, settlements, borders, security, water, rights, the, permit, regime, palestinian, freedom, of, movement, and, the, palestinian, right, of, return, the, conflict, has, its, origins, in, the, rise, of, zionism, in, europe, and, the, consequent, first, arrival, of, jewish, settlers, to, ottoman, palestine, in, 1882, the, local, arab, population, increasingly, began, to, oppose, zionism, primarily, out, of, fear, of, territorial, displacement, and, dispossession, the, zionist, movement, garnered, the, support, of, an, imperial, power, in, the, 1917, balfour, declaration, issued, by, britain, which, promised, to, support, the, creation, of, a, jewish, homeland, in, palestine, following, british, occupation, of, the, formerly, ottoman, region, during, world, war, i, mandatory, palestine, was, established, as, a, british, mandate, increasing, jewish, immigration, led, to, tensions, between, jews, and, arabs, which, grew, into, intercommunal, conflict, in, 1936, an, arab, revolt, erupted, demanding, independence, and, an, end, to, british, support, for, zionism, which, was, suppressed, by, the, british, eventually, tensions, led, to, the, un, adopting, a, partition, plan, in, 1947, triggering, a, civil, war, during, the, ensuing, 1948, palestine, war, more, than, half, of, the, mandate, s, predominantly, palestinian, arab, population, fled, or, were, expelled, by, israeli, forces, by, the, end, of, the, war, israel, was, established, on, most, of, the, former, mandate, s, territory, and, the, gaza, strip, and, the, west, bank, were, controlled, by, egypt, and, jordan, respectively, since, the, 1967, six, day, war, israel, has, been, occupying, the, west, bank, and, the, gaza, strip, known, collectively, as, the, palestinian, territories, two, palestinian, uprisings, against, israel, and, its, occupation, erupted, in, 1987, and, 2000, the, first, and, second, intifadas, respectively, israel, s, occupation, which, is, now, considered, to, be, the, longest, military, occupation, in, modern, history, has, seen, it, constructing, illegal, settlements, there, creating, a, system, of, institutionalized, discrimination, against, palestinians, under, its, occupation, called, israeli, apartheid, israel, has, drawn, international, condemnation, for, violating, the, human, rights, of, the, palestinians, the, international, community, with, the, exception, of, the, us, and, israel, has, been, in, consensus, since, the, 1980s, regarding, a, settlement, of, the, conflict, on, the, basis, of, a, two, state, solution, along, the, 1967, borders, and, a, just, resolution, for, palestinian, refugees, the, us, and, israel, have, instead, preferred, bilateral, negotiations, rather, than, resolving, the, conflict, on, the, basis, of, international, law, in, recent, years, public, support, for, a, two, state, solution, has, decreased, with, israeli, policy, reflecting, an, interest, in, maintaining, the, occupation, rather, than, seeking, a, permanent, resolution, to, the, conflict, in, 2007, israel, tightened, its, blockade, of, the, gaza, strip, and, made, official, its, policy, of, isolating, it, from, the, west, bank, since, then, israel, has, framed, its, relationship, with, gaza, in, terms, of, the, laws, of, war, rather, than, in, terms, of, its, status, as, an, occupying, power, in, july, 2024, the, international, court, of, justice, rebuffed, this, stance, determining, that, the, palestinian, territories, constitute, one, political, unit, and, that, israel, continues, to, illegally, occupy, the, west, bank, and, gaza, strip, the, court, also, determined, that, israeli, policies, violate, the, international, convention, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, racial, discrimination, since, 2006, hamas, and, israel, have, fought, five, wars, the, most, recent, of, which, began, in, 2023, and, is, ongoing, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, began, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, with, the, development, of, political, zionism, and, the, arrival, of, zionist, settlers, to, palestine, the, modern, political, zionist, movement, with, the, goal, of, establishing, a, jewish, state, in, palestine, grew, out, of, the, last, two, decades, of, the, 19th, century, largely, in, response, to, antisemitism, in, europe, while, jewish, colonization, began, during, this, period, it, was, not, until, the, arrival, of, more, ideologically, zionist, immigrants, in, the, decade, preceding, the, first, world, war, that, the, landscape, of, ottoman, palestine, would, start, to, significantly, change, land, purchases, the, eviction, of, tenant, arab, peasants, and, armed, confrontation, with, jewish, para, military, units, would, all, contribute, to, the, palestinian, population, s, growing, fear, of, territorial, displacement, and, dispossession, this, fear, would, gradually, be, replaced, by, a, broader, sense, of, palestinian, national, expression, which, included, the, rejection, of, the, zionist, goal, of, turning, the, mostly, arab, populated, land, into, a, jewish, homeland, from, early, on, the, leadership, of, the, zionist, movement, had, the, idea, of, transferring, a, euphemism, for, ethnic, cleansing, the, arab, palestinian, population, out, of, the, land, for, the, purpose, of, establishing, a, jewish, demographic, majority, according, to, the, israeli, historian, benny, morris, the, idea, of, transfer, was, inevitable, and, inbuilt, into, zionism, the, arab, population, felt, this, threat, as, early, as, the, 1880s, with, the, arrival, of, the, first, aliyah, chaim, weizmann, s, efforts, to, build, british, support, for, the, zionist, movement, would, eventually, secure, the, balfour, declaration, a, public, statement, issued, by, the, british, government, in, 1917, during, the, first, world, war, announcing, support, for, the, establishment, of, a, national, home, for, the, jewish, people, in, palestine, weizmann, would, take, on, a, maximalist, interpretation, of, the, declaration, in, which, negotiations, on, the, future, of, the, country, were, to, happen, directly, between, britain, and, the, jews, excluding, arab, representation, at, the, paris, peace, conference, he, would, later, famously, share, his, interpretation, of, the, declaration, in, his, announcement, of, the, goal, o, make, palestine, as, jewish, as, england, is, english, partially, in, response, to, the, zionist, movement, a, palestinian, national, movement, would, develop, more, concretely, in, the, interwar, period, the, years, that, followed, would, see, jewish, palestinian, relations, deteriorate, dramatically, with, the, commitment, to, establishing, a, national, home, for, the, jewish, people, in, palestine, the, creation, of, the, british, mandate, in, palestine, after, the, end, of, the, first, world, war, would, allow, for, large, scale, jewish, immigration, this, would, be, accompanied, by, the, development, of, a, separate, jewish, controlled, sector, of, the, economy, which, was, supported, with, large, amounts, of, capital, from, abroad, the, more, ardent, zionist, ideologues, of, the, second, aliyah, would, become, the, leaders, of, the, yishuv, starting, in, the, 1920s, and, believed, in, the, separation, of, jewish, and, arab, economies, and, societies, during, this, period, the, exclusionary, nationalist, ethos, would, grow, to, overpower, the, socialist, ideals, that, the, second, aliyah, had, arrived, with, amin, al, husseini, the, leader, of, the, palestinian, arab, national, movement, immediately, marked, jewish, national, movement, and, jewish, immigration, to, palestine, as, the, sole, enemy, to, his, cause, initiating, large, scale, riots, against, the, jews, as, early, as, 1920, in, jerusalem, and, in, 1921, in, jaffa, among, the, results, of, the, violence, was, the, establishment, of, the, jewish, paramilitary, force, haganah, in, 1929, a, series, of, violent, riots, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, 133, jews, and, 116, arabs, with, significant, jewish, casualties, in, hebron, and, safed, and, the, evacuation, of, jews, from, hebron, and, gaza, in, the, early, 1930s, the, arab, national, struggle, in, palestine, had, drawn, many, arab, nationalist, militants, from, across, the, middle, east, such, as, sheikh, izaddin, al, qassam, from, syria, who, established, the, black, hand, militant, group, and, had, prepared, the, grounds, for, the, 1936, 1939, arab, revolt, in, palestine, following, the, death, of, al, qassam, at, the, hands, of, the, british, in, late, 1935, tensions, erupted, in, 1936, into, the, arab, general, strike, and, general, boycott, the, strike, soon, deteriorated, into, violence, and, the, arab, revolt, was, bloodily, repressed, by, the, british, assisted, by, the, british, armed, forces, of, the, jewish, settlement, police, the, jewish, supernumerary, police, and, special, night, squads, the, suppression, of, the, revolt, would, leave, at, least, 10, of, the, adult, male, population, killed, wounded, imprisoned, or, exiled, in, the, first, wave, of, organized, violence, lasting, until, early, 1937, most, of, the, arab, groups, were, defeated, by, the, british, and, forced, expulsion, of, much, of, the, arab, leadership, ensued, with, much, of, the, leadership, in, exile, and, the, economy, severely, weakened, the, palestinians, would, struggle, to, confront, the, zionist, movement, which, was, growing, in, strength, with, the, support, of, the, british, the, cost, and, risks, associated, with, the, revolt, and, the, ongoing, inter, communal, conflict, led, to, a, shift, in, british, policies, in, the, region, and, the, appointment, of, the, peel, commission, which, recommended, the, partitioning, of, palestine, the, two, main, zionist, leaders, chaim, weizmann, and, david, ben, gurion, accepted, the, recommendations, on, the, basis, that, it, would, allow, for, further, expansion, but, some, secondary, zionist, leaders, disapproved, of, it, the, subsequent, publication, of, the, white, paper, of, 1939, which, sought, to, limit, jewish, immigration, to, the, region, was, the, breaking, point, in, relations, between, british, authorities, and, the, zionist, movement, the, renewed, violence, which, continued, sporadically, until, the, beginning, of, world, war, ii, ended, with, around, 5, 000, causualties, on, the, arab, side, and, 700, combined, on, the, british, and, jewish, side, total, with, the, eruption, of, world, war, ii, the, situation, in, mandatory, palestine, calmed, down, it, allowed, a, shift, towards, a, more, moderate, stance, among, palestinian, arabs, under, the, leadership, of, the, nashashibi, clan, and, even, the, establishment, of, the, jewish, arab, palestine, regiment, under, british, command, fighting, germans, in, north, africa, the, more, radical, exiled, faction, of, al, husseini, however, tended, to, cooperate, with, nazi, germany, and, participated, in, the, establishment, of, a, pro, nazi, propaganda, machine, throughout, the, arab, world, the, defeat, of, arab, nationalists, in, iraq, and, subsequent, relocation, of, al, husseini, to, nazi, occupied, europe, tied, his, hands, regarding, field, operations, in, palestine, though, he, regularly, demanded, that, the, italians, and, the, germans, bomb, tel, aviv, by, the, end, of, world, war, ii, a, crisis, over, the, fate, of, holocaust, survivors, from, europe, led, to, renewed, tensions, between, the, yishuv, and, mandate, authorities, increased, illegal, immigration, from, jewish, refugees, along, with, a, paramilitary, campaign, of, resistance, against, british, authorities, by, zionist, militias, would, effectively, overturn, the, white, paper, and, eventually, lead, to, the, withdrawal, of, the, british, on, 29, november, 1947, the, general, assembly, of, the, united, nations, adopted, resolution, 181, ii, recommending, the, adoption, and, implementation, of, a, plan, to, partition, palestine, into, an, arab, state, a, jewish, state, and, the, city, of, jerusalem, palestinian, arabs, were, opposed, to, the, partition, zionists, accepted, the, partition, but, planned, to, expand, israel, s, borders, beyond, what, was, allocated, to, it, by, the, un, on, the, next, day, palestine, was, swept, by, violence, for, four, months, under, continuous, arab, provocation, and, attack, the, yishuv, was, usually, on, the, defensive, while, occasionally, retaliating, the, arab, league, supported, the, arab, struggle, by, forming, the, volunteer, based, arab, liberation, army, supporting, the, palestinian, arab, army, of, the, holy, war, under, the, leadership, of, abd, al, qadir, al, husayni, and, hasan, salama, on, the, jewish, side, the, civil, war, was, managed, by, the, major, underground, militias, the, haganah, irgun, and, lehi, strengthened, by, numerous, jewish, veterans, of, world, war, ii, and, foreign, volunteers, by, spring, 1948, it, was, already, clear, that, the, arab, forces, were, nearing, a, total, collapse, while, yishuv, forces, gained, more, and, more, territory, creating, a, large, scale, refugee, problem, of, palestinian, arabs, following, the, declaration, of, the, establishment, of, the, state, of, israel, on, 14, may, 1948, the, arab, league, decided, to, intervene, on, behalf, of, palestinian, arabs, marching, their, forces, into, former, british, palestine, beginning, the, main, phase, of, the, 1948, arab, israeli, war, the, overall, fighting, leading, to, around, 15, 000, casualties, resulted, in, cease, fire, and, armistice, agreements, of, 1949, with, israel, holding, much, of, the, former, mandate, territory, jordan, occupying, and, later, annexing, the, west, bank, and, egypt, taking, over, the, gaza, strip, where, the, all, palestine, government, was, declared, by, the, arab, league, on, 22, september, 1948, through, the, 1950s, jordan, and, egypt, supported, the, palestinian, fedayeen, militants, cross, border, attacks, into, israel, while, israel, carried, out, its, own, reprisal, operations, in, the, host, countries, the, 1956, suez, crisis, resulted, in, a, short, term, israeli, occupation, of, the, gaza, strip, and, exile, of, the, all, palestine, government, which, was, later, restored, with, israeli, withdrawal, the, all, palestine, government, was, completely, abandoned, by, egypt, in, 1959, and, was, officially, merged, into, the, united, arab, republic, to, the, detriment, of, the, palestinian, national, movement, gaza, strip, then, was, put, under, the, authority, of, the, egyptian, military, administrator, making, it, a, de, facto, military, occupation, in, 1964, however, a, new, organization, the, palestine, liberation, organization, plo, was, established, by, yasser, arafat, it, immediately, won, the, support, of, most, arab, league, governments, and, was, granted, a, seat, in, the, arab, league, in, the, 1967, arab, israel, war, israel, occupied, the, palestinian, west, bank, east, jerusalem, gaza, strip, egyptian, sinai, syrian, golan, heights, and, two, islands, in, the, gulf, of, aqaba, by, the, mid, 1970s, the, international, community, had, converged, on, a, framework, to, resolve, the, conflict, this, included, israel, s, full, withdrawal, from, the, occupied, territories, in, exchange, for, recognition, by, the, palestinians, and, other, arab, nations, and, the, establishment, of, an, independent, palestinian, state, in, the, west, bank, and, gaza, and, a, just, resolution, of, the, palestinian, refugee, question, these, principles, known, as, land, for, peace, and, palestinian, self, determination, through, a, two, state, settlement, were, endorsed, by, the, international, court, of, justice, the, united, nations, and, international, human, rights, organizations, the, june, 1967, war, exerted, a, significant, effect, upon, palestinian, nationalism, as, israel, gained, military, control, of, the, west, bank, from, jordan, and, the, gaza, strip, from, egypt, consequently, the, plo, was, unable, to, establish, any, control, on, the, ground, and, established, its, headquarters, in, jordan, home, to, hundreds, of, thousands, of, palestinians, and, supported, the, jordanian, army, during, the, war, of, attrition, which, included, the, battle, of, karameh, however, the, palestinian, base, in, jordan, collapsed, with, the, jordanian, palestinian, civil, war, in, 1970, the, plo, defeat, by, the, jordanians, caused, most, of, the, palestinian, militants, to, relocate, to, south, lebanon, where, they, soon, took, over, large, areas, creating, the, so, called, fatahland, on, october, 6, 1973, a, coalition, of, arab, forces, consisting, of, mainly, egypt, and, syria, launched, a, surprise, attack, against, israel, on, the, jewish, holy, day, of, yom, kippur, egyptian, and, syria, had, crossed, over, the, ceasefire, lines, that, were, agreed, upon, prior, to, 1973, egypt, had, in, particular, tried, to, reoccupy, much, of, the, area, surrounding, the, suez, canal, whilst, the, frontline, with, syria, was, mainly, situated, around, the, north, in, the, golan, heights, the, war, concluded, with, an, israeli, victory, with, both, sides, suffering, tremendous, casualties, following, the, end, of, the, war, the, un, security, council, passed, resolution, 338, which, confirmed, the, land, for, peace, principle, established, in, resolution, 242, initiating, the, middle, east, peace, process, the, arab, defeat, would, play, an, important, role, in, the, plo, s, willingness, to, pursue, a, negotiated, settlement, to, the, conflict, additionally, many, israelis, began, to, believe, that, the, area, under, israeli, occupation, could, not, be, held, indefinitely, by, force, the, camp, david, accords, agreed, upon, by, israel, and, egypt, in, 1978, primarily, aimed, to, establish, a, peace, treaty, between, the, two, countries, the, accords, also, proposed, the, creation, of, a, self, governing, authority, for, the, arab, population, in, the, west, bank, and, gaza, strip, excluding, jerusalem, while, it, promised, full, autonomy, for, the, inhabitants, the, land, was, to, remain, under, israeli, control, a, peace, treaty, based, on, these, accords, was, signed, in, 1979, leading, to, israel, s, withdrawal, from, the, occupied, egyptian, sinai, peninsula, by, 1982, however, the, specifics, of, the, palestinian, autonomy, accords, were, disputed, among, the, signatories, and, other, arab, groups, and, were, never, implemented, palestinian, insurgency, in, south, lebanon, peaked, in, the, early, 1970s, as, lebanon, was, used, as, a, base, to, launch, attacks, on, northern, israel, and, airplane, hijacking, campaigns, worldwide, which, drew, israeli, retaliation, during, the, lebanese, civil, war, palestinian, militants, continued, to, launch, attacks, against, israel, while, also, battling, opponents, within, lebanon, in, 1978, the, coastal, road, massacre, led, to, the, israeli, full, scale, invasion, known, as, operation, litani, this, operation, sought, to, dislodge, the, plo, from, lebanon, while, expanding, the, area, under, the, control, of, the, israeli, allied, christian, militias, in, southern, lebanon, the, operation, succeeded, in, leaving, a, large, portion, of, the, south, in, control, of, the, israeli, proxy, which, would, eventually, form, the, south, lebanon, army, under, united, states, pressure, israeli, forces, would, eventually, withdraw, from, lebanon, in, 1982, israel, having, secured, its, southern, border, with, egypt, sought, to, resolve, the, palestinian, issue, by, attempting, to, dismantle, the, military, and, political, power, of, the, palestine, liberation, organization, plo, in, lebanon, the, goal, was, to, establish, a, friendly, regime, in, lebanon, and, continue, its, policy, of, settlement, and, annexation, in, occupied, palestine, the, plo, had, observed, the, latest, ceasefire, with, israel, and, shown, a, preference, for, negotiations, over, military, operations, as, a, result, israel, sought, to, remove, the, plo, as, a, potential, negotiating, partner, most, palestinian, militants, were, defeated, within, several, weeks, beirut, was, captured, and, the, plo, headquarters, were, evacuated, to, tunisia, in, june, by, yasser, arafat, s, decision, the, first, palestinian, uprising, began, in, 1987, as, a, response, to, escalating, attacks, and, the, endless, occupation, by, the, early, 1990s, international, efforts, to, settle, the, conflict, had, begun, in, light, of, the, success, of, the, egyptian, israeli, peace, treaty, of, 1982, eventually, the, israeli, palestinian, peace, process, led, to, the, oslo, accords, of, 1993, allowing, the, plo, to, relocate, from, tunisia, and, take, ground, in, the, west, bank, and, gaza, strip, establishing, the, palestinian, national, authority, the, peace, process, also, had, significant, opposition, among, radical, islamic, elements, of, palestinian, society, such, as, hamas, and, palestinian, islamic, jihad, who, immediately, initiated, a, campaign, of, attacks, targeting, israelis, following, hundreds, of, casualties, and, a, wave, of, radical, anti, government, propaganda, israeli, prime, minister, rabin, was, assassinated, by, an, israeli, far, right, extremist, who, objected, to, the, peace, initiative, this, struck, a, serious, blow, to, the, peace, process, from, which, the, newly, elected, government, of, israel, in, 1996, backed, off, following, several, years, of, unsuccessful, negotiations, the, conflict, re, erupted, as, the, second, intifada, in, september, 2000, the, violence, escalating, into, an, open, conflict, between, the, palestinian, national, security, forces, and, the, israel, defense, forces, lasted, until, 2004, 2005, and, led, to, approximately, 130, fatalities, in, 2005, israeli, prime, minister, sharon, ordered, the, removal, of, israeli, settlers, and, soldiers, from, gaza, israel, and, its, supreme, court, formally, declared, an, end, to, occupation, saying, it, had, no, effective, control, over, what, occurred, in, gaza, however, the, united, nations, human, rights, watch, and, many, other, international, bodies, and, ngos, continue, to, consider, israel, to, be, the, occupying, power, of, the, gaza, strip, as, israel, controls, gaza, strip, s, airspace, territorial, waters, and, controls, the, movement, of, people, or, goods, in, or, out, of, gaza, by, air, or, sea, in, 2006, hamas, won, a, plurality, of, 44, in, the, palestinian, parliamentary, election, israel, responded, it, would, begin, economic, sanctions, unless, hamas, agreed, to, accept, prior, israeli, palestinian, agreements, forswear, violence, and, recognize, israel, s, right, to, exist, all, of, which, hamas, rejected, after, internal, palestinian, political, struggle, between, fatah, and, hamas, erupted, into, the, battle, of, gaza, 2007, hamas, took, full, control, of, the, area, in, 2007, israel, imposed, a, naval, blockade, on, the, gaza, strip, and, cooperation, with, egypt, allowed, a, ground, blockade, of, the, egyptian, border, the, tensions, between, israel, and, hamas, escalated, until, late, 2008, when, israel, launched, operation, cast, lead, upon, gaza, resulting, in, thousands, of, civilian, casualties, and, billions, of, dollars, in, damage, by, february, 2009, a, ceasefire, was, signed, with, international, mediation, between, the, parties, though, the, occupation, and, small, and, sporadic, eruptions, of, violence, continued, in, 2011, a, palestinian, authority, attempt, to, gain, un, membership, as, a, fully, sovereign, state, failed, in, hamas, controlled, gaza, sporadic, rocket, attacks, on, israel, and, israeli, air, raids, continued, to, occur, in, november, 2012, palestinian, representation, in, the, un, was,

israel, s, right, to, exist, this, stipulation, required, the, plo, to, abandon, its, objective, of, reclaiming, all, of, historic, palestine, and, instead, focus, on, the, 22, percent, which, came,

make, a, historic, compromise, at, this, time, while, the, israeli, cabinet, continued, to, oppose, the, existence, of, a, palestinian, state, yaniv, described, arafat, s, willingness, to, compromise, as, a, peace, offensive, which, israel, responded, to, by, planning, to, remove, the, plo, as, a, potential, negotiating, partner, in, order, to, evade, international, diplomatic, pressure, israel, would, invade, lebanon, the, following, year, in, an, attempt, to, undermine, the, plo, as, a, political, organization, weakening, palestinian, nationalism, and, facilitating, the, annexation, of, the, west, bank, into, greater, israel, while, the, plo, had, adopted, a, program, of, pursuing, a, palestinian, state, alongside, israel, since, the, mid, 1970s, the, 1988, palestinian, declaration, of, independence, formally, consecrated, this, objective, this, declaration, which, was, based, on, resolutions, from, the, palestine, national, council, sessions, in, the, late, 1970s, and, 1980s, advocated, for, the, creation, of, a, palestinian, state, comprising, the, west, bank, gaza, strip, and, east, jerusalem, within, the, borders, set, by, the, 1949, armistice, lines, prior, to, june, 5, 1967, following, the, declaration, arafat, explicitly, denounced, all, forms, of, terrorism, and, affirmed, the, plo, s, acceptance, of, un, resolutions, 242, and, 338, as, well, as, the, recognition, of, israel, s, right, to, exist, all, the, conditions, defined, by, henry, kissinger, for, us, negotiations, with, the, plo, had, now, been, met, israeli, prime, minister, yitzhak, shamir, stood, behind, the, stance, that, the, plo, was, a, terrorist, organization, he, maintained, a, strict, stance, against, any, concessions, including, withdrawal, from, occupied, palestinian, territories, recognition, of, or, negotiations, with, the, plo, and, especially, the, establishment, of, a, palestinian, state, shamir, viewed, the, u, s, decision, to, engage, in, dialogue, with, the, plo, as, a, mistake, that, threatened, the, existing, territorial, status, quo, he, argued, that, negotiating, with, the, plo, meant, accepting, the, existence, of, a, palestinian, state, and, hence, was, unacceptable, the, term, peace, process, refers, to, the, step, by, step, approach, to, resolving, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, having, originally, entered, into, usage, to, describe, the, us, mediated, negotiations, between, israel, and, surrounding, arab, countries, notably, egypt, the, term, peace, process, has, grown, to, be, associated, with, an, emphasis, on, the, negotiation, process, rather, than, on, presenting, a, comprehensive, solution, to, the, conflict, as, part, of, this, process, fundamental, issues, of, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, such, as, borders, access, to, resources, and, the, palestinian, right, of, return, have, been, left, to, final, status, talks, such, final, status, negotiations, along, the, lines, discussed, in, madrid, in, 1991, have, never, taken, place, the, oslo, accords, of, 1993, and, 1995, built, on, the, incremental, framework, put, in, place, by, the, 1978, camp, david, negotiations, and, the, 1991, madrid, and, washington, talks, the, motivation, behind, the, incremental, approach, towards, a, settlement, was, that, it, would, build, confidence, but, the, eventual, outcome, was, instead, a, dramatic, decline, in, mutual, confidence, at, each, incremental, stage, israel, further, entrenched, its, occupation, of, the, palestinian, territories, despite, the, pa, upholding, its, obligation, to, curbing, violent, attacks, from, extremist, groups, in, part, by, cooperating, with, israeli, forces, meron, benvenisti, former, deputy, mayor, of, jerusalem, observed, that, life, became, harsher, for, palestinians, during, this, period, as, state, violence, increased, and, palestinian, land, continued, to, be, expropriated, as, settlements, expanded, israeli, foreign, minister, shlomo, ben, ami, described, the, oslo, accords, as, legitimizing, the, transformation, of, the, west, bank, into, what, has, been, called, a, cartographic, cheeseboard, core, to, the, oslo, accords, was, the, creation, of, the, palestinian, authority, and, the, security, cooperation, it, would, enter, into, with, the, israeli, military, authorities, in, what, has, been, described, as, the, outsourcing, of, the, occupation, to, the, pa, just, before, signing, the, oslo, accord, rabin, described, the, expectation, that, the, palestinians, will, be, better, at, establishing, internal, security, than, we, were, because, they, will, allow, no, appeals, to, the, sepreme, court, and, will, prevent, from, criticizing, the, conditions, there, along, these, lines, ben, ami, who, participated, in, the, camp, david, 2000, talks, described, this, process, one, of, the, meanings, of, oslo, was, that, the, plo, was, eventually, israel, s, collaborator, in, the, task, of, stifling, the, intifada, and, cutting, short, what, was, clearly, an, authentically, democratic, struggle, for, palestinian, independence, the, wye, river, memorandum, agreed, on, by, the, pa, and, israel, introduced, a, zero, tolerance, policy, for, terror, and, violence, this, policy, was, uniformly, criticised, by, human, rights, organizations, for, its, encouragement, of, human, rights, abuses, dennis, ross, describes, the, wye, as, having, successfully, reduced, both, violent, and, non, violent, protests, both, of, which, he, considers, to, be, inconsistent, with, the, spirit, of, wye, watson, claims, that, the, pa, frequently, violated, its, obligations, to, curb, incitement, and, its, record, on, curbing, terrorism, and, other, security, obligations, under, the, wye, river, memorandum, was, at, best, mixed, in, 1993, israeli, officials, led, by, yitzhak, rabin, and, palestinian, leaders, from, the, palestine, liberation, organization, led, by, yasser, arafat, strove, to, find, a, peaceful, solution, through, what, became, known, as, the, oslo, peace, process, a, crucial, milestone, in, this, process, was, arafat, s, letter, of, recognition, of, israel, s, right, to, exist, emblematic, of, the, asymmetry, in, the, oslo, process, israel, was, not, required, to, and, did, not, recognize, the, right, of, a, palestinian, state, to, exist, in, 1993, the, declaration, of, principles, or, oslo, i, was, signed, and, set, forward, a, framework, for, future, israeli, palestinian, negotiations, in, which, key, issues, would, be, left, to, final, status, talks, the, stipulations, of, the, oslo, agreements, ran, contrary, to, the, international, consensus, for, resolving, the, conflict, the, agreements, did, not, uphold, palestinian, self, determination, or, statehood, and, repealed, the, internationally, accepted, interpretation, of, un, resolution, 242, that, land, cannot, be, acquired, by, war, with, respect, to, access, to, land, and, resources, noam, chomsky, described, the, oslo, agreements, as, allowing, israel, to, do, virtually, what, it, likes, the, oslo, process, was, delicate, and, progressed, in, fits, and, starts, the, process, took, a, turning, point, at, the, assassination, of, yitzhak, rabin, in, november, 1995, and, the, election, of, netanyahu, in, 1996, finally, unraveling, when, arafat, and, ehud, barak, failed, to, reach, an, agreement, at, camp, david, in, july, 2000, and, later, at, taba, in, 2001, the, interim, period, specified, by, oslo, had, not, built, confidence, between, the, two, parties, barak, had, failed, to, implement, additional, stages, of, the, interim, agreements, and, settlements, expanded, by, 10, during, his, short, term, the, disagreement, between, the, two, parties, at, camp, david, was, primarily, on, the, acceptance, or, rejection, of, international, consensus, for, palestinian, negotiators, the, international, consensus, as, represented, by, the, yearly, vote, in, the, un, general, assembly, which, passes, almost, unanimously, was, the, starting, point, for, negotiations, the, israeli, negotiators, supported, by, the, american, participants, did, not, accept, the, international, consensus, as, the, basis, for, a, settlement, both, sides, eventually, accepted, the, clinton, parameters, with, reservations, but, the, talks, at, taba, were, called, to, a, halt, by, barak, and, the, peace, process, itself, came, to, a, stand, still, ben, ami, who, participated, in, the, talks, at, camp, david, as, israel, s, foreign, minister, would, later, describe, the, proposal, on, the, table, the, clinton, parameters, are, the, best, proof, that, arafat, was, right, to, turn, down, the, summit, s, offers, in, july, 2000, us, president, bill, clinton, convened, a, peace, summit, between, palestinian, president, yasser, arafat, and, israeli, prime, minister, ehud, barak, barak, reportedly, put, forward, the, following, as, bases, for, negotiation, via, the, us, to, the, palestinian, president, a, non, militarized, palestinian, state, split, into, 3, 4, parts, containing, 87, 92, of, the, west, bank, after, having, already, given, up, 78, of, historic, palestine, thus, an, israeli, offer, of, 91, percent, of, the, west, bank, 5, 538, km, 2, of, the, west, bank, translates, into, only, 86, percent, from, the, palestinian, perspective, including, arab, parts, of, east, jerusalem, and, the, entire, gaza, strip, as, well, as, a, stipulation, that, 69, jewish, settlements, which, comprise, 85, of, the, west, bank, s, jewish, settlers, would, be, ceded, to, israel, no, right, of, return, to, israel, no, sovereignty, over, the, temple, mount, or, any, core, east, jerusalem, neighbourhoods, and, continued, israel, control, over, the, jordan, valley, arafat, rejected, this, offer, which, palestinian, negotiators, israeli, analysts, and, israeli, foreign, minister, shlomo, ben, ami, described, as, unacceptable, according, to, the, palestinian, negotiators, the, offer, did, not, remove, many, of, the, elements, of, the, israeli, occupation, regarding, land, security, settlements, and, jerusalem, after, the, camp, david, summit, a, narrative, emerged, supported, by, israeli, prime, minister, ehud, barak, and, his, foreign, minister, shlomo, ben, ami, as, well, as, us, officials, including, dennis, ross, and, madeleine, albright, that, yasser, arafat, had, rejected, a, generous, peace, offer, from, israel, and, instead, incited, a, violent, uprising, this, narrative, suggested, that, arafat, was, not, interested, in, a, two, state, solution, but, rather, aimed, to, destroy, israel, and, take, over, all, of, palestine, this, view, was, widely, accepted, in, us, and, israeli, public, opinion, nearly, all, scholars, and, most, israeli, and, us, officials, involved, in, the, negotiations, have, rejected, this, narrative, these, individuals, include, prominent, israeli, negotiators, the, idf, chief, of, staff, the, head, of, the, idf, s, intelligence, bureau, the, head, of, the, shin, bet, as, well, as, their, advisors, no, tenable, solution, was, crafted, which, would, satisfy, both, israeli, and, palestinian, demands, even, under, intense, us, pressure, clinton, has, long, blamed, arafat, for, the, collapse, of, the, summit, in, the, months, following, the, summit, clinton, appointed, former, us, senator, george, j, mitchell, to, lead, a, fact, finding, committee, aiming, to, identify, strategies, for, restoring, the, peace, process, the, committee, s, findings, were, published, in, 2001, with, the, dismantlement, of, existing, israeli, settlements, and, palestinian, crackdown, on, militant, activity, being, one, strategy, following, the, failed, summit, palestinian, and, israeli, negotiators, continued, to, meet, in, small, groups, through, august, and, september, 2000, to, try, to, bridge, the, gaps, between, their, respective, positions, the, united, states, prepared, its, own, plan, to, resolve, the, outstanding, issues, clinton, s, presentation, of, the, us, proposals, was, delayed, by, the, advent, of, the, second, intifada, at, the, end, of, september, clinton, s, plan, eventually, presented, on, 23, december, 2000, proposed, the, establishment, of, a, sovereign, palestinian, state, in, the, gaza, strip, and, 94, 96, percent, of, the, west, bank, plus, the, equivalent, of, 1, 3, percent, of, the, west, bank, in, land, swaps, from, pre, 1967, israel, on, jerusalem, the, plan, stated, that, the, general, principle, is, that, arab, areas, are, palestinian, and, that, jewish, areas, are, israeli, the, holy, sites, were, to, be, split, on, the, basis, that, palestinians, would, have, sovereignty, over, the, temple, mount, noble, sanctuary, while, the, israelis, would, have, sovereignty, over, the, western, wall, on, refugees, the, plan, suggested, a, number, of, proposals, including, financial, compensation, the, right, of, return, to, the, palestinian, state, and, israeli, acknowledgment, of, suffering, caused, to, the, palestinians, in, 1948, security, proposals, referred, to, a, non, militarized, palestinian, state, and, an, international, force, for, border, security, both, sides, accepted, clinton, s, plan, and, it, became, the, basis, for, the, negotiations, at, the, taba, peace, summit, the, following, january, the, israeli, negotiation, team, presented, a, new, map, at, the, taba, summit, in, taba, egypt, in, january, 2001, the, proposition, removed, the, temporarily, israeli, controlled, areas, and, the, palestinian, side, accepted, this, as, a, basis, for, further, negotiation, with, israeli, elections, looming, the, talks, ended, without, an, agreement, but, the, two, sides, issued, a, joint, statement, attesting, to, the, progress, they, had, made, the, sides, declare, that, they, have, never, been, closer, to, reaching, an, agreement, and, it, is, thus, our, shared, belief, that, the, remaining, gaps, could, be, bridged, with, the, resumption, of, negotiations, following, the, israeli, elections, the, following, month, the, likud, party, candidate, ariel, sharon, defeated, ehud, barak, in, the, israeli, elections, and, was, elected, as, israeli, prime, minister, on, 7, february, 2001, sharon, s, new, government, chose, not, to, resume, the, high, level, talks, one, peace, proposal, presented, by, the, quartet, of, the, european, union, russia, the, united, nations, and, the, united, states, on, 17, september, 2002, was, the, road, map, for, peace, this, plan, did, not, attempt, to, resolve, difficult, questions, such, as, the, fate, of, jerusalem, or, israeli, settlements, but, left, that, to, be, negotiated, in, later, phases, of, the, process, the, proposal, never, made, it, beyond, the, first, phase, whose, goals, called, for, a, halt, to, both, israeli, settlement, construction, and, israeli, palestinian, violence, neither, goal, has, been, achieved, as, of, november, 2015, the, annapolis, conference, was, a, middle, east, peace, conference, held, on, 27, november, 2007, at, the, united, states, naval, academy, in, annapolis, maryland, united,

peace, it, spelled, out, final, solution, borders, based, explicitly, on, the, un, borders, established, before, the, 1967, six, day, war, it, offered, full, normalization, of, relations, with, israel, in, exchange, for, the, withdrawal, of, its, forces, from, all, the, occupied, territories, including, the, golan, heights, to, recognize, an, independent, palestinian, state, with, east, jerusalem, as, its, capital, in, the, west, bank, and, gaza, strip, as, well, as, a, just, solution, for, the, palestinian, refugees, the, palestinian, authority, led, by, yasser, arafat, immediately, embraced, the, initiative, his, successor, mahmoud, abbas, also, supported, the, plan, and, officially, asked, u, s, president, barack, obama, to, adopt, it, as, part, of, his, middle, east, policy, islamist, political, party, hamas, the, elected, government, of, the, gaza, strip, was, deeply, divided, with, most, factions, rejecting, the, plan, palestinians, have, criticised, the, israel, united, arab, emirates, normalization, agreement, and, another, with, bahrain, signed, in, september, 2020, fearing, the, moves, weaken, the, arab, peace, initiative, regarding, the, uae, s, move, as, a, betrayal, the, israeli, government, under, ariel, sharon, rejected, the, initiative, as, a, non, starter, because, it, required, israel, to, withdraw, to, pre, june, 1967, borders, after, the, renewed, arab, league, endorsement, in, 2007, then, prime, minister, ehud, olmert, gave, a, cautious, welcome, to, the, plan, in, 2015, israeli, prime, minister, benjamin, netanyahu, expressed, tentative, support, for, the, initiative, but, in, 2018, he, rejected, it, as, a, basis, for, future, negotiations, with, the, palestinians, in, july, 2024, the, international, court, of, justice,

is, justified, in, not, ceding, all, this, land, because, of, security, concerns, and, also, because, the, lack, of, any, valid, diplomatic, agreement, at, the, time, means, that, ownership, and,

israel, illegally, the, soldier, was, demoted, and, given, a, 1, year, sentence, with, a, five, month, suspension, the, idf, answered, the, charges, stating, that, its, army, held, itself, to, the, highest, of, professional, standards, adding, that, when, there, was, suspicion, of, wrongdoing, it, investigated, and, took, action, where, appropriate, since, 2006, israel, has, enforced, an, official, and, explicit, policy, of, enforcing, separation, between, the, west, bank, and, gaza, strip, this, separation, policy, has, involved, strict, restrictions, on, imports, exports, and, travel, to, and, from, the, gaza, strip, this, policy, began, to, develop, as, early, as, the, 1950s, but, was, further, formalized, with, the, implementation, of, an, israeli, closure, regime, in, 1991, where, israel, began, requiring, gazans, to, obtain, permits, to, exit, the, gaza, strip, and, to, enter, the, west, bank, cancelling, the, general, exit, permit, by, treating, the, gaza, strip, as, a, separate, entity, israel, has, aimed, to, increase, it, s, control, over, the, west, bank, while, avoiding, a, political, resolution, to, the, conflict, the, lack, of, territorial, contiguity, between, gaza, and, the, west, bank, and, the, absence, of, any, safe, passage, explain, the, success, of, israel, s, policy, of, separation, harvard, political, economist, sara, roy, describes, the, separation, policy, as, motivated, by, israeli, rejection, of, territorial, compromise, fundamentally, undermining, palestinian, political, and, economic, cohesion, and, weakening, national, unity, among, palestinians, the, severing, of, gaza, from, the, west, bank, hinterland, reflects, a, paradigm, shift, in, the, framing, of, the, conflict, after, hamas, assumed, power, in, 2007, israel, declared, gaza, a, hostile, territory, preferring, to, frame, its, obligations, towards, gaza, in, terms, of, the, law, of, armed, conflict, over, what, it, presented, as, a, border, dispute, as, opposed, to, those, of, military, occupation, this, framing, was, rebuffed, by, the, icj, in, 2024, when, the, court, stated, that, israel, continued, to, occupy, the, gaza, strip, even, after, the, 2005, disengagement, indeed, the, intensified, blockade, policy, was, presented, by, israeli, officials, as, economic, warfare, intended, to, keep, the, gazan, economy, on, the, brink, of, collapse, at, the, lowest, possible, level, roy, cites, an, israeli, supreme, court, s, decision, approving, fuel, cuts, to, gaza, as, emblematic, of, the, disabling, of, gaza, the, court, deemed, the, fuel, cuts, permissible, on, the, basis, that, they, would, not, harm, the, population, s, essential, humanitarian, needs, the, executive, director, of, the, israeli, human, rights, organization, gisha, described, israeli, policy, towards, gaza, between, 2007, and, 2010, as, explicitly, punitive, controlling, the, entry, of, food, based, on, calculated, calorie, needs, to, limit, economic, activity, and, enforce, economic, warfare, these, restrictions, included, allowing, only, small, packets, of, margarine, to, prevent, local, food, production, gaza, s, gdp, dramatically, declined, during, this, period, as, a, result, of, these, measures, indeed, by, april, 2010, israel, restricted, the, entry, of, commercial, items, to, gaza, to, a, list, of, 73, products, compared, with, 4, 000, products, which, had, previously, been, approved, the, result, was, the, virtual, collapse, of, gaza, s, private, sector, which, roy, describes, as, largely, completed, after, the, 2008, israeli, operation, cast, lead, in, gaza, according, to, gisha, travel, restrictions, from, the, gaza, strip, are, not, based, on, individual, security, concerns, rather, the, general, rule, is, that, travel, to, israel, or, the, west, bank, from, gaza, is, not, permitted, other, than, in, exceptional, cases, israeli, imposed, travel, restrictions, aim, in, particular, to, prevent, gazans, from, living, in, the, west, bank, indeed, israeli, policy, treats, the, gaza, strip, as, a, terminus, station, with, family, reunification, between, the, west, bank, and, gaza, strip, only, possible, if, the, family, agrees, to, permanently, relocate, to, the, gaza, strip, the, israeli, officials, described, the, blockade, as, serving, limited, security, value, instead, referring, to, these, restrictions, as, motivated, by, political, security, although, closure, has, a, long, history, in, gaza, dating, back, to, 1991, when, it, was, first, imposed, it, was, made, more, acute, after, 2000, with, the, start, of, the, second, intifada, closure, was, tightened, further, after, the, 2005, disengagement, and, then, again, in, 2006, after, hamas, s, electoral, victory, heightened, restrictions, were, imposed, on, imports, and, exports, as, well, as, on, the, movement, of, people, including, gaza, s, labor, force, the, total, siege, of, gaza, that, was, imposed, following, the, hamas, led, attack, on, israel, during, october, 7, 2023, was, part, of, that, same, policy, of, separation, and, closure, characterized, by, the, destruction, of, gaza, s, infrastructure, especially, housing, and, the, denial, of, food, water, electricity, and, fuel, to, its, population, on, 9, october, 2023, israel, declared, war, on, hamas, and, tightened, its, blockade, of, the, gaza, strip, israeli, defense, minister, yoav, gallant, declared, there, will, be, no, electricity, no, food, no, fuel, everything, is, closed, we, are, fighting, human, animals, and, we, are, acting, accordingly, since, its, initiation, blockade, has, had, a, detrimental, impact, on, the, private, sector, in, gaza, the, primary, driver, of, economic, growth, in, gaza, prior, to, the, blockade, gaza, imported, 95, of, its, inputs, for, manufacturing, and, exported, 85, of, the, finished, products, primarily, to, israel, and, the, west, bank, employment, in, this, sector, dropped, to, 4, by, 2010, with, an, overall, unemployment, rate, of, 40, at, this, time, and, 80, of, the, population, living, on, less, than, 2, dollars, a, day, fewer, than, 40, commercial, items, were, allowed, in, to, the, gaza, strip, by, 2009, compared, to, a, list, of, 4, 000, items, before, the, start, of, the, blockade, fuel, imports, were, restricted, such, that, 95, of, gaza, s, industrial, operations, were, forced, to, close, with, the, rest, operating, far, below, capacity, in, aggregate, 100, 000, out, of, the, 120, 000, employed, in, the, private, sector, lost, their, jobs, as, a, result, of, the, blockade, most, critically, for, the, economy, has, been, the, near, complete, ban, on, exports, from, the, gaza, strip, the, number, of, truckloads, carrying, exports, fell, to, 2, their, pre, blockade, numbers, only, exports, to, the, european, market, were, allowed, a, far, less, profitable, market, for, gazans, than, israel, and, the, west, bank, the, products, approved, for, export, were, primarily, flowers, and, strawberries, the, first, export, to, the, west, bank, or, israel, did, not, happen, until, 2012, and, only, in, very, limited, quantities, up, to, four, truckloads, of, furniture, manufactured, in, gaza, were, allowed, through, israel, for, an, exhibition, in, amman, even, in, the, early, years, of, israeli, imposed, closure, the, associated, increased, cost, of, doing, business, had, a, detrimental, impact, on, trade, goods, transferred, between, the, west, bank, gaza, and, israel, were, required, to, be, loaded, onto, palestinian, trucks, initially, and, then, off, loaded, onto, israeli, trucks, at, the, border, even, for, distances, of, 50, 100, miles, these, increased, costs, include, the, costs, for, security, checks, clearance, storage, and, spoilage, as, well, as, increased, transportation, costs, the, military, advocate, general, of, israel, said, that, israel, is, justified, under, international, law, to, impose, a, blockade, on, an, enemy, for, security, reasons, as, hamas, turned, the, territory, under, its, de, facto, control, into, a, launching, pad, of, mortar, and, rocket, attacks, against, israeli, towns, and, villages, in, southern, israel, media, headlines, have, described, a, united, nations, commission, as, ruling, that, israel, s, blockade, is, both, legal, and, appropriate, however, amnesty, international, has, stated, that, this, is, completely, false, and, that, the, cited, un, report, made, no, such, claim, the, israeli, government, s, continued, land, sea, and, air, blockage, is, tantamount, to, collective, punishment, of, the, population, according, to, the, united, nations, office, for, the, coordination, of, humanitarian, affairs, in, january, 2008, the, israeli, government, calculated, how, many, calories, per, person, were, needed, to, prevent, a, humanitarian, crisis, in, the, gaza, strip, and, then, subtracted, eight, percent, to, adjust, for, the, culture, and, experience, of, the, gazans, details, of, the, calculations, were, released, following, israeli, human, rights, organization, gisha, s, application, to, the, high, court, israel, s, coordinator, of, government, activities, in, the, territories, who, drafted, the, plan, stated, that, the, scheme, was, never, formally, adopted, this, was, not, accepted, by, gisha, on, 20, june, 2010, in, response, to, the, gaza, flotilla, raid, israel, s, security, cabinet, approved, a, new, system, governing, the, blockade, that, would, allow, practically, all, non, military, or, dual, use, items, to, enter, the, gaza, strip, according, to, a, cabinet, statement, israel, would, expand, the, transfer, of, construction, materials, designated, for, projects, that, have, been, approved, by, the, palestinian, authority, including, schools, health, institutions, water, sanitation, and, more, as, well, as, projects, that, are, under, international, supervision, despite, the, easing, of, the, land, blockade, israel, will, continue, to, inspect, all, goods, bound, for, gaza, by, sea, at, the, port, of, ashdod, despite, these, announcements, the, economic, situation, did, not, substantially, change, and, the, virtual, complete, ban,

unanimously, in, favor, of, a, resolution, calling, for, the, establishment, of, a, palestinian, state, on, the, 1967, borders, the, us, and, israel, instead, prefer, to, pursue, bilateral, negotiation, rather, than, resolving, the, conflict, on, the, basis, of, international, law, netanyahu, has, criticized, the, palestinians, of, purportedly, trying, to, bypass, direct, talks, whereas, abbas, has, argued, that, the, continued, construction, of, israeli, jewish, settlements, is, undermining, the, realistic, potential, for, the, two, state, solution, although, palestine, has, been, denied, full, member, status, by, the, un, security, council, in, late, 2012, the, un, general, assembly, overwhelmingly, approved, the, de, facto, recognition, of, sovereign, palestine, by, granting, non, member, state, status, following, the, oslo, accords, which, was, to, set, up, regulative, bodies, to, rein, in, frictions, palestinian, incitement, against, israel, jews, and, zionism,

have, been, reciprocal, both, sides, interpreting, media, statements, in, the, palestinian, and, israeli, press, as, constituting, incitement, schoolbooks, published, for, both, israeli, and, palestinian, schools, have, been, found, to, have, encouraged, one, sided, narrative, and, even, hatred, of, the, other, side, perpetrators, of, murderous, attacks, whether, against, israelis, or, palestinians, often, find, strong, vocal, support, from, sections, of, their, communities, despite, varying, levels, of, condemnation, from, politicians, both, parties, to, the, conflict, have, been, criticized, by, third, parties, for, teaching, incitement, to, their, children, by, downplaying, each, side, s, historical, ties, to, the, area, teaching, propagandist, maps, or, indoctrinate, their, children, to, one, day, join, the, armed, forces, the, core, issues, of, the, conflict, are, borders, the, status, of, settlements, in, the, west, bank, the, status, of, east, jerusalem, the, palestinian, refugee, right, of, return, and, security, with, the, plo, s, recognition, of, israel, s, right, to, exist, in, 1982, the, international, community, with, the, main, exception, of, the, united, states, and, israel, has, been, in, consensus, on, a, framework, for, resolving, the, conflict, on, the, basis, of, international, law, various, un, bodies, and, the, icj, have, supported, this, position, every, year, the, un, general, assembly, votes, almost, unamimously, in, favor, of, a, resolution, titled, peaceful, settlement, of, the, question, of, palestine, this, resolution, consistently, affirms, the, illegality, of, the, israeli, settlements, the, annexation, of, east, jerusalem, and, the, principle, of, the, inadmissibility, of, the, acquisition, of, territory, by, war, it, also, emphasizes, the, need, for, an, israeli, withdrawal, from, the, palestinian, territory, occupied, since, 1967, and, the, need, for, a, just, resolution, to, the, refugee, question, on, the, basis, of, un, resolution, 194, unilateral, strategies, and, the, rhetoric, of, hardline, political, factions, coupled, with, violence, have, fostered, mutual, embitterment, and, hostility, and, a, loss, of, faith, in, the, possibility, of, reaching, a, peaceful, settlement, since, the, break, down, of, negotiations, security, has, played, a, less, important, role, in, israeli, concerns, trailing, behind, employment, corruption, housing, and, other, pressing, issues, israeli, policy, had, reoriented, to, focus, on, managing, the, conflict, and, the, associated, occupation, of, palestinian, territory, rather, than, reaching, a, negotiated, solution, the, expansion, of, israeli, settlements, in, the, west, bank, has, led, the, majority, of, palestinians, to, believe, that, israel, is, not, committed, to, reaching, an, agreement, but, rather, to, a, pursuit, of, establishing, permanent, control, over, this, territory, in, order, to, provide, that, security, in, 1967,

himself, repeatedly, assured, his, american, and, israeli, interlocutors, at, camp, david, that, he, primarily, sought, the, principle, of, the, right, of, return, to, be, accepted, rather, than, the, full, right, of, return, in, practice, palestinian, and, international, authors, have, justified, the, right, of, return, of, the, palestinian, refugees, on, several, grounds, several, scholars, included, in, the, broader, new, historians, argue, that, the, palestinian, refugees, fled, or, were, chased, out, or, expelled, by, the, actions, of, the, haganah, lehi, and, irgun, zionist, paramilitary, groups, a, number, have, also, characterized, this, as, an, ethnic, cleansing, the, new, historians, cite, indications, of, arab, leaders, desire, for, the, palestinian, arab, population, to, stay, put, the, israeli, law, of, return, that, grants, citizenship, to, people, of, jewish, descent, has, been, described, as, discriminatory, against, other, ethnic, groups, especially, palestinians, that, cannot, apply, for, such, citizenship, under, the, law, of, return, to, the, territory, which, they, were, expelled, from, or, fled, during, the, course, of, the, 1948, war, according, to, the, un, resolution, 194, adopted, in, 1948, the, refugees, wishing, to, return, to, their, homes, and, live, at, peace, with, their, neighbours, should, be, permitted, to, do, so, at, the, earliest, practicable, date, and, that, compensation, should, be, paid, for, the, property, of, those, choosing, not, to, return, and, for, loss, of, or, damage, to, property, which, under, principles, of, international, law, or, in, equity, should, be, made, good, by, the, governments, or, authorities, responsible, un, resolution, 3236, reaffirms, also, the, inalienable, right, of, the, palestinians, to, return, to, their, homes, and, property, from, which, they, have, been, displaced, and, uprooted, and, calls, for, their, return, resolution, 242, from, the, un, affirms, the, necessity, for, achieving, a, just, settlement, of, the, refugee, problem, however, resolution, 242, does, not, specify, that, the, just, settlement, must, or, should, be, in, the, form, of, a, literal, palestinian, right, of, return, historically, there, has, been, debate, over, the, relative, impact, of, the, causes, of, the, 1948, palestinian, exodus, although, there, is, a, wide, consensus, that, violent, expulsions, by, zionist, and, israeli, forces, were, the, main, factor, other, factors, include, psychological, warfare, and, arab, sense, of, vulnerability, notably, historian, benny, morris, states, that, most, of, palestine, s, 700, 000, refugees, fled, because, of, the, flail, of, war, and, expected, to, return, home, shortly, after, a, successful, arab, invasion, he, documents, instances, in, which, arab, leaders, advised, the, evacuation, of, entire, communities, as, happened, in, haifa, although, recognizes, that, these, were, isolated, events, in, his, later, work, morris, considers, the, displacement, the, result, of, a, national, conflict, initiated, by, the, arabs, themselves, in, a, 2004, interview, with, haaretz, he, described, the, exodus, as, largely, resulting, from, an, atmosphere, of, transfer, that, was, promoted, by, ben, gurion, and, understood, by, the, military, leadership, he, also, claimed, that, there, are, circumstances, in, history, that, justify, ethnic, cleansing, he, has, been, criticized, by, political, scientist, norman, finkelstein, for, having, seemingly, changed, his, views, for, political, rather, than, historical, reasons, although, israel, accepts, the, right, of, the, palestinian, diaspora, to, return, into, a, new, palestinian, state, israel, insists, that, the, return, of, this, population, into, the, current, state, of, israel, would, threaten, the, stability, of, the, jewish, state, an, influx, of, palestinian, refugees, would, lead, to, the, end, of, the, state, of, israel, as, a, jewish, state, since, a, demographic, majority, of, jews, would, not, be, maintained, throughout, the, conflict, palestinian, violence, has, been, a, concern, for, israelis, security, concerns, have, historically, been, a, key, driver, in, israeli, political, decision, making, often, expanding, in, scope, and, taking, precedence, over, other, considerations, such, as, international, law, and, palestinian, human, rights, the, occupation, of, the, west, bank, gaza, east, jerusalem, and, the, continued, expansion, of, settlements, in, those, areas, have, been, justified, on, security, grounds, israel, along, with, the, united, states, and, the, european, union, refer, to, any, use, of, force, by, palestinian, groups, as, terroristic, and, criminal, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, consensus, in, international, law, which, allows, for, palestinians, as, a, people, under, illegal, military, occupation, to, use, lethal, force, against, israeli, military, targets, and, installations, in, israel, palestinian, suicide, bombers, have, targeted, civilian, buses, restaurants, shopping, malls, hotels, and, marketplaces, from, 1993, to, 2003, 303, palestinian, suicide, bombers, attacked, israel, in, 1994, hamas, initiated, their, first, lethal, suicide, attack, in, response, to, the, cave, of, the, patriarchs, massacre, where, american, israeli, physician, baruch, goldstein, opened, fire, in, a, mosque, killing, 29, people, and, injuring, 125, the, israeli, government, initiated, the, construction, of, a, security, barrier, following, scores, of, suicide, bombings, and, terrorist, attacks, in, july, 2003, israel, s, coalition, government, approved, the, security, barrier, in, the, northern, part, of, the, green, line, between, israel, and, the, west, bank, according, to, the, idf, since, the, erection, of, the, fence, terrorist, acts, have, declined, by, approximately, 90, the, decline, in, attacks, can, also, be, attributed, to, the, permanent, presence, of, israeli, troops, inside, and, around, palestinian, cities, and, increasing, security, cooperation, between, the, idf, and, the, palestinian, authority, during, this, period, the, barrier, followed, a, route, that, ran, almost, entirely, through, land, occupied, by, israel, in, june, 1967, unilaterally, seizing, more, than, 10, of, the, west, bank, including, whole, neighborhoods, and, settlement, blocs, while, splitting, palestinian, villages, in, half, with, immediate, effects, on, palestinian, s, freedom, of, movement, the, barrier, in, some, areas, isolated, farmers, from, their, fields, and, children, from, their, schools, while, also, restricting, palestinians, from, moving, within, the, west, bank, or, pursuing, employment, in, israel, in, 2004, the, international, court, of, justice, ruled, that, the, construction, of, the, barrier, violated, the, palestinian, right, to, self, determination, contravened, the, fourth, geneva, convention, and, could, not, be, justified, as, a, measure, of, israeli, self, defense, the, icj, further, expressed, that, the, construction, of, the, wall, by, israel, could, become, a, permanent, fixture, altering, the, status, quo, israel, s, high, court, however, disagreed, with, the, icj, s, conclusions, stating, that, they, lacked, a, factual, basis, several, human, rights, organizations, including, b, tselem, human, rights, watch, and, amnesty, international, echoed, the, icj, s, concerns, they, suggested, that, the, wall, s, route, was, designed, to, perpetuate, the, existence, of, settlements, and, facilitate, their, future, annexation, into, israel, and, that, the, wall, was, a, means, for, israel, to, consolidate, control, over, land, used, for, illegal, settlements, the, sophisticated, structure, of, the, wall, also, indicated, its, likely, permanence, since, 2001, the, threat, of, qassam, rockets, fired, from, palestinian, territories, into, israel, continues, to, be, of, great, concern, for, israeli, defense, officials, in, 2006, the, year, following, israel, s, disengagement, from, the, gaza, strip, the, israeli, government, claimed, to, have, recorded, 1, 726, such, launches, more, than, four, times, the, total, rockets, fired, in, 2005, as, of, january, 2009, over, 8, 600, rockets, have, been, launched, causing, widespread, psychological, trauma, and, disruption, of, daily, life, as, a, result, of, these, attacks, israelis, living, in, southern, israel, have, had, to, spend, long, periods, in, bomb, shelters, the, relatively, small, payload, carried, on, these, rockets, israel, s, advanced, early, warning, system, american, supplied, anti, missile, capabilities, and, network, of, shelters, made, the, rockets, rarely, lethal, in, 2014, out, of, 4, 000, rockets, fired, from, the, gaza, strip, only, six, israeli, civilians, were, killed, for, comparison, the, payload, carried, on, these, rockets, is, smaller, than, israeli, tank, shells, of, which, 49, 000, where, fired, in, gaza, in, 2014, there, is, significant, debate, within, israel, about, how, to, deal, with, the, country, s, security, concerns, options, have, included, military, action, including, targeted, killings, and, house, demolitions, of, terrorist, operatives, diplomacy, unilateral, gestures, toward, peace, and, increased, security, measures, such, as, checkpoints, roadblocks, and, security, barriers, the, legality, and, the, wisdom, of, all, of, the, above, tactics, have, been, called, into, question, by, various, commentators, since, mid, june, 2007, israel, s, primary, means, of, dealing, with, security, concerns, in, the, west, bank, has, been, to, cooperate, with, and, permit, united, states, sponsored, training, equipping, and, funding, of, the, palestinian, authority, s, security, forces, which, with, israeli, help, have, largely, succeeded, in, quelling, west, bank, supporters, of, hamas, in, the, middle, east, water, resources, are, of, great, political, concern, since, israel, receives, much, of, its, water, from, two, large, underground, aquifers, which, continue, under, the, green, line, the, use, of, this, water, has, been, contentious, in, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, israel, withdraws, most, water, from, these, areas, but, it, also, supplies, the, west, bank, with, approximately, 40, million, cubic, metres, annually, contributing, to, 77, of, palestinians, water, supply, in, the, west, bank, which, is, to, be, shared, for, a, population, of, about, 2, 6, million, while, israel, s, consumption, of, this, water, has, decreased, since, it, began, its, occupation, of, the, west, bank, it, still, consumes, the, majority, of, it, in, the, 1950s, israel, consumed, 95, of, the, water, output, of, the, western, aquifer, and, 82, of, that, produced, by, the, northeastern, aquifer, although, this, water, was, drawn, entirely, on, israel, s, own, side, of, the, pre, 1967, border, the, sources, of, the, water, are, nevertheless, from, the, shared, groundwater, basins, located, under, both, west, bank, and, israel, in, the, oslo, ii, accord, both, sides, agreed, to, maintain, existing, quantities, of, utilization, from, the, resources, in, so, doing, the, palestinian, authority, established, the, legality, of, israeli, water, production, in, the, west, bank, subject, to, a, joint, water, committee, jwc, moreover, israel, obligated, itself, in, this, agreement, to, provide, water, to, supplement, palestinian, production, and, further, agreed, to, allow, additional, palestinian, drilling, in, the, eastern, aquifer, also, subject, to, the, joint, water, committee, the, water, that, israel, receives, comes, mainly, from, the, jordan, river, system, the, sea, of, galilee, and, two, underground, sources, according, to, a, 2003, bbc, article, the, palestinians, lack, access, to, the, jordan, river, system, according, to, a, report, of, 2008, by, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, of, the, united, nations, water, resources, were, confiscated, for, the, benefit, of, the, israeli, settlements, in, the, ghor, palestinian, irrigation, pumps, on, the, jordan, river, were, destroyed, or, confiscated, after, the, 1967, war, and, palestinians, were, not, allowed, to, use, water, from, the, jordan, river, system, furthermore, the, authorities, did, not, allow, any, new, irrigation, wells, to, be, drilled, by, palestinian, farmers, while, it, provided, fresh, water, and, allowed, drilling, wells, for, irrigation, purposes, at, the, jewish, settlements, in, the, west, bank, and, gaza, strip, a, report, was, released, by, the, un, in, august, 2012, and, max, gaylard, the, un, resident, and, humanitarian, coordinator, in, the, occupied, palestinian, territory, explained, at, the, launch, of, the, publication, gaza, will, have, half, a, million, more, people, by, 2020, while, its, economy, will, grow, only, slowly, in, consequence, the, people, of, gaza,

organizations, have, established, bilateral, agreements, with, the, palestinian, and, israeli, water, authorities, it, was, estimated, that, a, future, investment, of, about, us, 1, 1bn, for, the, west, bank, and, 0, 8bn, for, the, gaza, strip, southern, governorates, was, needed, for, the, planning, period, from, 2003, to, 2015, in, late, 2012, a, donation, of, 21, 6, million, was, announced, by, the, government, of, the, netherlands, the, dutch, government, stated, that, the, funds, would, be, provided, to, the, un, relief, and, works, agency, for, palestinian, refugees, in, the, near, east, unrwa, for, the, specific, benefit, of, palestinian, children, an, article, published, by, the, un, news, website, stated, that, of, the, 21, 6, million, 5, 7, will, be, allocated, to, unrwa, s, 2012, emergency, appeal, for, the, occupied, palestinian, territory, which, will, support, programmes, in, the, west, bank, and, gaza, aiming, to, mitigate, the, effects, on, refugees, of, the, deteriorating, situation, they, face, the, conflict, has, been, about, land, since, its, inception, when, israel, became, a, state, after, the, war, in, 1948, 77, of, palestine, s, land, was, used, for, the, creation, on, the, state, the, majority, of, those, living, in, palestine, at, the, time, became, refugees, in, other, countries, and, this, first, land, crisis, became, the, root, of, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, because, the, root, of, the, conflict, is, with, land, the, disputes, between, israel, and, palestine, are, well, manifested, in, the, agriculture, of, palestine, in,

the, past, 10, years, unemployment, rates, in, palestine, have, increased, and, the, agricultural, sector, became, the, most, impoverished, sector, in, palestine, unemployment, rates, peaked, in, 2008, when, they, reached, 41, in, gaza, palestinian, agriculture, suffers, from, numerous, problems, including, israeli, military, and, civilian, attacks, on, farms, and, farmers, blockades, to,

impacted, the, imports, and, exports, in, palestine, and, weakened, the, industrial, and, agricultural, sectors, because, of, the, constant, israeli, control, in, the, west, bank, and, gaza, in,

known, and, notorious, terrorist, acts, was, the, capture, and, eventual, murder, of, 11, israeli, athletes, carried, out, by, the, black, september, organization, during, the, 1972, olympic, games, fighting, among, rival, palestinian, and, arab, movements, has, played, a, crucial, role, in, shaping, israel, s, security, policy, towards, palestinian, militants, as, well, as, in, the, palestinian, leadership, s, own, policies, as, early, as, the, 1930s, revolts, in, palestine, arab, forces, fought, each, other, while, also, skirmishing, with, zionist, and, british, forces, and, internal, conflicts, continue, to, the, present, day, in, the, first, intifada, more, than, a, thousand, palestinians, were, killed, in, a, campaign, initiated, by, the, palestine, liberation, organization, to, crack, down, on, suspected, israeli, security, service, informers, and, collaborators, the, palestinian, authority, was, strongly, criticized, for, its, treatment, of, alleged, collaborators, rights, groups, complaining, that, those, labeled, collaborators, were, denied, fair, trials, according, to, a, report, released, by, the, palestinian, human, rights, monitoring, group, less, than, 45, percent, of, those, killed, were, actually, guilty, of, informing, for, israel, as, far, as, israel, is, concerned, the, jurisdiction, of, the, palestinian, authority, is, derived, from, the, oslo, accords, signed, with, the, plo, under, which, it, acquired, control, over, cities, in, the, palestinian, territories, area, a, while, the, surrounding, countryside, came, either, under, israeli,

to, address, palestinian, security, needs, israel, has, expressed, no, agreement, to, withdrawal, from, some, areas, b, resulting, in, no, reduction, in, the, division, of, the, palestinian, areas, and, the, institution, of, a, safe, pass, system, without, israeli, checkpoints, between, these, parts, under, the, oslo, accords, as, a, security, measure, israel, has, insisted, on, its, control,
