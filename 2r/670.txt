operates, in, the, wider, context, of, social, history, certain, jurists, and, historians, of, legal, process, have, seen, legal, history, as, the, recording, of, the, evolution, of, laws, and, the, technical, explanation, of, how, these, laws, have, evolved, with, the, view, of, better, understanding, the, origins, of, various, legal, concepts, some, consider, legal, history, a, branch, of, intellectual, history, twentieth, century, historians, viewed, legal, history, in, a, more, contextualised, manner, more, in, line, with, the, thinking, of, social, historians, they, have, looked, at, legal, institutions, as, complex, systems, of, rules, players, and, symbols, and, have, seen, these, elements, interact, with, society, to, change, adapt, resist, or, promote, certain, aspects, of, civil, society, such, legal, historians, have, tended, to, analyse, case, histories, from, the, parameters, of, social, science, inquiry, using, statistical, methods, analysing, class, distinctions, among, litigants, petitioners, and, other, players, in, various, legal, processes, by, analyzing, case, outcomes, transaction, costs, and, numbers, of, settled, cases, they, have, begun, an, analysis, of, legal, institutions, practices, procedures, and, briefs, that, gives, a, more, complex, picture, of, law, and, society, than, the, study, of, jurisprudence, case, law, and, civil, codes, can, achieve, ancient, egyptian, law, dating, as, far, back, as, 3000, bc, was, based, on, the, concept, of, ma, at, and, was, characterised, by, tradition, rhetorical, speech, social, equality, and,

the, modern, legal, world, over, the, centuries, between, the, rise, and, decline, of, the, roman, empire, roman, law, in, the, days, of, the, roman, republic, and, empire, was, heavily, procedural, and, there, was, no, professional, legal, class, instead, a, lay, person, iudex, was, chosen, to, adjudicate, precedents, were, not, reported, so, any, case, law, that, developed, was, disguised, and, almost, unrecognised, each, case, was, to, be, decided, afresh, from, the, laws, of, the, state, which, mirrors, the, theoretical, unimportance, of, judges, decisions, for, future, cases, in, civil, law, systems, today, during, the, 6th, century, ad, in, the, eastern, roman, empire, the, emperor, justinian, codified, and, consolidated, the, laws, that, had, existed, in, rome, so, that, what, remained, was, one, twentieth, of, the, mass, of, legal, texts, from, before, this, became, known, as, the, corpus, juris, civilis, as, one, legal, historian, wrote, justinian, consciously, looked, back, to, the, golden, age, of, roman, law, and, aimed, to, restore, it, to, the, peak, it, had, reached, three, centuries, before, during, the, byzantine, empire, the, justinian, code, was, expanded, and, remained, in, force, until, the, empire, fell, though, it, was, never, officially, introduced, to, the, west, instead, following, the, fall, of, the, western, empire, and, in, former, roman, countries, the, ruling, classes, relied, on, the, theodosian, code, to, govern, natives, and, germanic, customary, law, for, the, germanic, incomers, a, system, known, as, folk, right, until, the, two, laws, blended, together, since, the, roman, court, system, had, broken, down, legal, disputes, were, adjudicated, according, to, germanic, custom, by, assemblies, of, learned, lawspeakers, in, rigid, ceremonies, and, in, oral, proceedings, that, relied, heavily, on, testimony, after, much, of, the, west, was, consolidated, under, charlemagne, law, became, centralized, so, as, to, strengthen, the, royal, court, system, and, consequently, case, law, and, abolished, folk, right, however, once, charlemagne, s, kingdom, definitively, splintered, europe, became, feudalistic, and, law, was, generally, not, governed, above, the, county, municipal, or, lordship, level, thereby, creating, a, highly, decentralized, legal, culture, that, favored, the, development, of, customary, law, founded, on, localized, case, law, however, in, the, 11th, century, crusaders, having, pillaged, the, byzantine, empire, returned, with, byzantine, legal, texts, including, the, justinian, code, and, scholars, at, the, university, of, bologna, were, the, first, to, use, them, to, interpret, their, own, customary, laws, medieval, european, legal, scholars, began, researching, the, roman, law, and, using, its, concepts, and, prepared, the, way, for, the, partial, resurrection, of, roman, law, as, the, modern, civil, law, in, a, large, part, of, the, world, there, was, however, a, great, deal, of, resistance, so, that, civil, law, rivaled, customary, law, for, much, of, the, late, middle, ages, after, the, norman, conquest, of, england, which, introduced, norman, legal, concepts, into, medieval, england, the, english, king, s, powerful, judges, developed, a, body, of, precedent, that, became, the, common, law, in, particular, henry, ii, instituted, legal, reforms, and, developed, a, system, of, royal, courts, administered, by, a, small, number, of, judges, who, lived, in, westminster, and, traveled, throughout, the, kingdom, henry, ii, also, instituted, the, assize, of, clarendon, in, 1166, which, allowed, for, jury, trials, and, reduced, the, number, of, trials, by, combat, louis, ix, of, france, also, undertook, major, legal, reforms, and, inspired, by, ecclesiastical, court, procedure, extended, canon, law, evidence, and, inquisitorial, trial, systems, to, the, royal, courts, in, 1280, and, 1295, measures, were, instituted, by, the, court, of, arches, and, other, authorities, in, london, to, improve, the, conduct, of, lawyers, in, the, courts, also, judges, no, longer, moved, on, circuits, becoming, fixed, to, their, jurisdictions, and, jurors, were, nominated, by, parties, to, the, legal, dispute, rather, than, by, the, sheriff, in, addition, by, the, 10th, century, the, law, merchant, first, founded, on, scandinavian, trade, customs, then, solidified, by, the, hanseatic, league, took, shape, so, that, merchants, could, trade, using, familiar, standards, rather, than, the, many, splintered, types, of, local, law, a, precursor, to, modern, commercial, law, the, law, merchant, emphasised, the, freedom, of, contract, and, alienability, of, property, the, two, main, traditions, of, modern, european, law, are, the, codified, legal, systems, of, most, of, continental, europe, and, the, english, tradition, based, on, case, law, as, nationalism, grew, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, lex, mercatoria, was, incorporated, into, countries, local, law, under, new, civil, codes, of, these, the, french, napoleonic, code, and, the, german, b, rgerliches, gesetzbuch, became, the, most, influential, as, opposed, to, english, common, law, which, consists, of, massive, tomes, of, case, law, codes, in, small, books, are, easy, to, export, and, for, judges, to, apply, however, today, there, are, signs, that, civil, and, common, law, are, converging, european, union, law, is, codified, in, treaties, but, develops, through, the, precedent, set, down, by, the, european, court, of, justice, the, african, law, system, is, based, on, common, law, and, civilian, law, many, legal, systems, in, africa, were, based, on, ethnic, customs, and, traditions, before, colonization, took, over, their, original, system, the, people, listened, to, their, elders, and, relied, on, them, as, mediators, during, disputes, several, states, didn, t, keep, written, records, as, their, laws, were, often, passed, orally, in,

spanish, law, such, as, the, prior, appropriation, doctrine, and, community, property, still, persist, in, some, us, states, particularly, those, that, were, part, of, the, mexican, cession, in, 1848,
