early, human, migrations, are, the, earliest, migrations, and, expansions, of, archaic, and, modern, humans, across, continents, they, are, believed, to, have, begun, approximately, 2, million, years, ago, with, the, early, expansions, out, of, africa, by, homo, erectus, this, initial, migration, was, followed, by, other, archaic, humans, including, h, heidelbergensis, which, lived, around, 500, 000, years, ago, and, was, the, likely, ancestor, of, denisovans, and, neanderthals, as, well, as, modern, humans, early, hominids, had, likely, crossed, land, bridges, that, have, now, sunk, within, africa, homo, sapiens, dispersed, around, the, time, of, its, speciation, roughly, 300, 000, years, ago, the, recent, african, origin, paradigm, suggests, that, the, anatomically, modern, humans, outside, of, africa, descend, from, a, population, of, homo, sapiens, migrating, from, east, africa, roughly, 70, 50, 000, years, ago, and, spreading, along, the, southern, coast, of, asia, and, to, oceania, by, about, 50, 000, years, ago, modern, humans, spread, across, europe, about, 40, 000, years, ago, early, eurasian, homo, sapiens, fossils, have, been, found, in, israel, and, greece, dated, to, 194, 000, 177, 000, and, 210, 000, years, old, respectively, these, fossils, seem, to, represent, failed, dispersal, attempts, by, early, homo, sapiens, who, were, likely, replaced, by, local, neanderthal, populations, the, migrating, modern, human, populations, are, known, to, have, interbred, with, earlier, local, populations, so, that, contemporary, human, populations, are, descended, in, small, part, below, 10, contribution, from, regional, varieties, of, archaic, humans, after, the, last, glacial, maximum, north, eurasian, populations, migrated, to, the, americas, about, 20, 000, years, ago, arctic, canada, and, greenland, were, reached, by, the, paleo, eskimo, expansion, around, 4, 000, years, ago, finally, polynesia, was, populated, within, the, past, 2, 000, years, in, the, last, wave, of, the, austronesian, expansion, the, earliest, humans, developed, out, of, australopithecine, ancestors, about, 3, million, years, ago, most, likely, in, the, area, of, the, kenyan, rift, valley, where, the, oldest, known, stone, tools, have, been, found, stone, tools, recently, discovered, at, the, shangchen, site, in, china, and, dated, to, 2, 12, million, years, ago, are, claimed, to, be, the, earliest, known, evidence, of, hominins, outside, africa, surpassing, dmanisi, in, georgia, by, 300, 000, years, between, 2, and, less, than, a, million, years, ago, homo, spread, throughout, east, africa, and, to, southern, africa, homo, ergaster, but, not, yet, to, west, africa, around, 1, 8, million, years, ago, homo, erectus, migrated, out, of, africa, via, the, levantine, corridor, and, horn, of, africa, to, eurasia, this, migration, has, been, proposed, as, being, related, to, the, operation, of, the, saharan, pump, around, 1, 9, million, years, ago, homo, erectus, dispersed, throughout, most, of, the, old, world, reaching, as, far, as, southeast, asia, its, distribution, is, traced, by, the, oldowan, lithic, industry, by, 1, 3, million, years, ago, extending, as, far, north, as, the, 40th, parallel, xiaochangliang, key, sites, for, this, early, migration, out, of, africa, are, riwat, in, pakistan, 2, ma, ubeidiya, in, the, levant, 1, 5, ma, and, dmanisi, in, the, caucasus, 1, 81, 0, 03, ma, p, 0, 05, china, shows, evidence, of, homo, erectus, from, 2, 12, mya, in, gongwangling, in, lantian, county, two, homo, erectus, incisors, have, been, found, near, yuanmou, southern, china, and, are, dated, to, 1, 7, mya, and, a, cranium, from, lantian, has, been, dated, to, 1, 63, mya, artefacts, from, majuangou, iii, and, shangshazui, in, the, nihewan, basin, northern, china, have, been, dated, to, 1, 6, 1, 7, mya, the, archaeological, site, of, xihoudu, in, shanxi, province, is, the, earliest, recorded, use, of, fire, by, homo, erectus, which, is, dated, 1, 27, million, years, ago, southeast, asia, java, was, reached, about, 1, 7, million, years, ago, meganthropus, western, europe, was, first, populated, around, 1, 2, million, years, ago, atapuerca, robert, g, bednarik, has, suggested, that, homo, erectus, may, have, built, rafts, and, sailed, oceans, a, theory, that, has, raised, some, controversy, one, million, years, after, its, dispersal, h, erectus, was, diverging, into, new, species, h, erectus, is, a, chronospecies, and, was, never, extinct, so, its, late, survival, is, a, matter, of, taxonomic, convention, late, forms, of, h, erectus, are, thought, to, have, survived, until, after, about, 0, 5, million, ago, to, 143, 000, years, ago, at, the, latest, with, derived, forms, classified, as, h, antecessor, in, europe, around, 800, 000, years, ago, and, h, heidelbergensis, in, africa, around, 600, 000, years, ago, h, heidelbergensis, in, its, turn, spread, across, east, africa, h, rhodesiensis, and, to, eurasia, where, it, gave, rise, to, neanderthals, and, denisovans, h, heidelbergensis, neanderthals, and, denisovans, expanded, north, beyond, the, 50th, parallel, eartham, pit, boxgrove, 500kya, swanscombe, heritage, park, 400kya, denisova, cave, 50, kya, it, has, been, suggested, that, late, neanderthals, may, even, have, reached, the, boundary, of, the, arctic, by, c, 32, 000, years, ago, when, they, were, being, displaced, from, their, earlier, habitats, by, h, sapiens, based, on, 2011, excavations, at, the, site, of, byzovaya, in, the, urals, komi, republic, 65, 01, n, 57, 25, e, 65, 02, n, 57, 42, e, 65, 02, 57, 42, other, archaic, human, species, are, assumed, to, have, spread, throughout, africa, by, this, time, although, the, fossil, record, is, sparse, their, presence, is, assumed, based, on, traces, of, admixture, with, modern, humans, found, in, the, genome, of, african, populations, homo, naledi, discovered, in, south, africa, in, 2013, and, tentatively, dated, to, about, 300, 000, years, ago, may, represent, fossil, evidence, of, such, an, archaic, human, species, neanderthals, spread, across, the, near, east, and, europe, while, denisovans, appear, to, have, spread, across, central, and, east, asia, and, to, southeast, asia, and, oceania, there, is, evidence, that, denisovans, interbred, with, neanderthals, in, central, asia, where, their, habitats, overlapped, neanderthal, evidence, has, also, been, found, quite, late, at, 33, 000, years, ago, at, the, 65th, latitude, of, the, byzovaya, site, in, the, ural, mountains, this, is, far, outside, of, any, otherwise, known, habitat, during, a, high, ice, cover, period, and, perhaps, reflects, a, refugia, of, near, extinction, homo, sapiens, are, believed, to, have, emerged, in, africa, about, 300, 000, years, ago, based, in, part, on, thermoluminescence, dating, of, artifacts, and, remains, from, jebel, irhoud, morocco, published, in, 2017, the, florisbad, skull, from, florisbad, south, africa, dated, to, about, 259, 000, years, ago, has, also, been, classified, as, early, homo, sapiens, previously, the, omo, remains, excavated, between, 1967, and, 1974, in, omo, national, park, ethiopia, and, dated, to, 200, 000, years, ago, were, long, held, to, be, the, oldest, known, fossils, of, homo, sapiens, in, september, 2019, scientists, reported, the, computerized, determination, based, on, 260, ct, scans, of, a, virtual, skull, shape, of, the, last, common, human, ancestor, to, anatomically, modern, humans, representative, of, the, earliest, modern, humans, and, suggested, that, modern, humans, arose, between, 260, 000, and, 350, 000, years, ago, through, a, merging, of, populations, in, east, and, south, africa, in, july, 2019, anthropologists, reported, the, discovery, of, 210, 000, year, old, remains, of, a, h, sapiens, and, 170, 000, year, old, remains, of, a, h, neanderthalensis, in, apidima, cave, in, southern, greece, more, than, 150, 000, years, older, than, previous, h, sapiens, finds, in, europe, early, modern, humans, expanded, to, western, eurasia, and, central, western, and, southern, africa, from, the, time, of, their, emergence, while, early, expansions, to, eurasia, appear, not, to, have, persisted, expansions, to, southern, and, central, africa, resulted, in, the, deepest, temporal, divergence, in, living, human, populations, early, modern, human, expansion, in, sub, saharan, africa, appears, to, have, contributed, to, the, end, of, late, acheulean, fauresmith, industries, at, about, 130, 000, years, ago, although, very, late, coexistence, of, archaic, and, early, modern, humans, until, as, late, as, 12, 000, years, ago, has, been, argued, for, west, africa, in, particular, the, ancestors, of, the, modern, khoi, san, expanded, to, southern, africa, before, 150, 000, years, ago, possibly, as, early, as, before, 260, 000, years, ago, so, that, by, the, beginning, of, the, mis, 5, megadrought, 130, 000, years, ago, there, were, two, ancestral, population, clusters, in, africa, bearers, of, mt, dna, haplogroup, l0, in, southern, africa, ancestral, to, the, khoi, san, and, bearers, of, haplogroup, l1, 6, in, central, eastern, africa, ancestral, to, everyone, else, there, was, a, significant, back, migration, of, bearers, of, l0, towards, eastern, africa, between, 120, and, 75, kya, expansion, to, central, africa, by, the, ancestors, of, the, central, african, forager, populations, african, pygmies, most, likely, took, place, before, 130, 000, years, ago, and, certainly, before, 60, 000, years, ago, the, situation, in, west, africa, is, difficult, to, interpret, due, to, a, sparsity, of, fossil, evidence, homo, sapiens, seems, to, have, reached, the, western, sahelian, zone, by, 130, 000, years, ago, while, tropical, west, african, sites, associated, with, h, sapiens, are, known, only, from, after, 130, 000, years, ago, unlike, elsewhere, in, africa, archaic, middle, stone, age, sites, appear, to, persist, until, very, late, down, to, the, holocene, boundary, 12, 000, years, ago, pointing, to, the, possibility, of, late, survival, of, archaic, humans, and, late, hybridization, with, h, sapiens, in, west, africa, populations, of, homo, sapiens, migrated, to, the, levant, and, to, europe, between, 130, 000, and, 115, 000, years, ago, and, possibly, in, earlier, waves, as, early, as, 185, 000, years, ago, a, fragment, of, a, jawbone, with, eight, teeth, found, at, misliya, cave, has, been, dated, to, around, 185, 000, years, ago, layers, dating, from, between, 250, 000, and, 140, 000, years, ago, in, the, same, cave, contained, tools, of, the, levallois, type, which, could, put, the, date, of, the, first, migration, even, earlier, if, the, tools, can, be, associated, with, the, modern, human, jawbone, finds, these, early, migrations, do, not, appear, to, have, led, to, lasting, colonisation, and, receded, by, about, 80, 000, years, ago, there, is, a, possibility, that, this, first, wave, of, expansion, may, have, reached, china, or, even, north, america, as, early, as, 125, 000, years, ago, but, would, have, died, out, without, leaving, a, trace, in, the, genome, of, contemporary, humans, there, is, some, evidence, that, modern, humans, left, africa, at, least, 125, 000, years, ago, using, two, different, routes, through, the, nile, valley, the, sinai, peninsula, and, the, levant, qafzeh, cave, 120, 000, 100, 000, years, ago, and, a, second, route, through, the, present, day, bab, el, mandeb, strait, on, the, red, sea, at, that, time, with, a, much, lower, sea, level, and, narrower, extension, crossing, to, the, arabian, peninsula, and, settling, in, places, like, the, present, day, united, arab, emirates, 125, 000, years, ago, and, oman, 106, 000, years, ago, and, possibly, reaching, the, indian, subcontinent, jwalapuram, 75, 000, years, ago, although, no, human, remains, have, yet, been, found, in, these, three, places, the, apparent, similarities, between, the, stone, tools, found, at, jebel, faya, those, from, jwalapuram, and, some, from, africa, suggest, that, their, creators, were, all, modern, humans, these, findings, might, give, some, support, to, the, claim, that, modern, humans, from, africa, arrived, at, southern, china, about, 100, 000, years, ago, zhiren, cave, zhirendong, chongzuo, city, 100, 000, years, ago, and, the, liujiang, hominid, liujiang, county, controversially, dated, at, 139, 000, 111, 000, years, ago, dating, results, of, the, lunadong, bubing, basin, guangxi, southern, china, teeth, which, include, a, right, upper, second, molar, and, a, left, lower, second, molar, indicate, that, the, molars, may, be, as, old, as, 126, 000, years, since, these, previous, exits, from, africa, did, not, leave, traces, in, the, results, of, genetic, analyses, based, on, the, y, chromosome, and, on, mtdna, it, seems, that, those, modern, humans, did, not, survive, in, large, numbers, and, were, assimilated, by, our, major, antecessors, an, explanation, for, their, extinction, or, small, genetic, imprint, may, be, the, toba, eruption, 74, 000, years, ago, though, some, argue, it, scarcely, affected, human, population, the, so, called, recent, dispersal, of, modern, humans, took, place, about, 70, 50, 000, years, ago, it, is, this, migration, wave, that, led, to, the, lasting, spread, of, modern, humans, throughout, the, world, a, small, group, from, a, population, in, east, africa, bearing, mitochondrial, haplogroup, l3, and, numbering, possibly, fewer, than, 1, 000, individuals, crossed, the, red, sea, strait, at, bab, el, mandeb, to, what, is, now, yemen, after, around, 75, 000, years, ago, a, recent, review, has, also, shown, support, for, the, northern, route, through, the, sinai, peninsula, and, the, levant, their, descendants, spread, along, the, coastal, route, around, arabia, and, persia, to, south, asia, before, 55, 000, years, ago, other, research, supports, a, migration, out, of, africa, between, about, 65, 000, and, 50, 000, years, ago, the, coastal, migration, between, roughly, 70, 000, and, 50, 000, years, ago, is, associated, with, mitochondrial, haplogroups, m, and, n, both, derivative, of, l3, along, the, way, h, sapiens, interbred, with, neanderthals, and, denisovans, with, denisovan, dna, making, 0, 2, of, mainland, asian, and, native, american, dna, migrations, continued, along, the, asian, coast, to, southeast, asia, and, oceania, colonising, australia, by, around, 65, 000, 50, 000, years, ago, by, reaching, australia, h, sapiens, for, the, first, time, expanded, its, habitat, beyond, that, of, h, erectus, denisovan, ancestry, is, shared, by, melanesians, aboriginal, australians, and, smaller, scattered, groups, of, people, in, southeast, asia, such, as, the, mamanwa, a, negrito, people, in, the, philippines, suggesting, the, interbreeding, took, place, in, eastern, asia, where, the, denisovans, lived, denisovans, may, have, crossed, the, wallace, line, with, wallacea, serving, as, their, last, refugium, homo, erectus, had, crossed, the, lombok, gap, reaching, as, far, as, flores, but, never, made, it, to, australia, during, this, time, sea, level, was, much, lower, and, most, of, maritime, southeast, asia, formed, one, land, mass, known, as, sunda, migration, continued, southeast, on, the, coastal, route, to, the, straits, between, sunda, and, sahul, the, continental, land, mass, of, present, day, australia, and, new, guinea, the, gaps, on, the, weber, line, are, up, to, 90, km, wide, so, the, migration, to, australia, and, new, guinea, would, have, required, seafaring, skills, migration, also, continued, along, the, coast, eventually, turning, northeast, to, china, and, finally, reaching, japan, before, turning, inland, this, is, evidenced, by, the, pattern, of, mitochondrial, haplogroups, descended, from, haplogroup, m, and, in, y, chromosome, haplogroup, c, sequencing, of, one, aboriginal, genome, from, an, old, hair, sample, in, western, australia, revealed, that, the, individual, was, descended, from, people, who, migrated, into, east, asia, between, 62, 000, and, 75, 000, years, ago, this, supports, the, theory, of, a, single, migration, into, australia, and, new, guinea, before, the, arrival, of, modern, asians, between, 25, 000, and, 38, 000, years, ago, and, their, later, migration, into, north, america, this, migration, is, believed, to, have, happened, around, 50, 000, years, ago, before, australia, and, new, guinea, were, separated, by, rising, sea, levels, approximately, 8, 000, years, ago, this, is, supported, by, a, date, of, 50, 000, 60, 000, years, ago, for, the, oldest, evidence, of, settlement, in, australia, around, 40, 000, years, ago, for, the, oldest, human, remains, the, earliest, humans, artifacts, which, are, at, least, 65, 000, years, old, and, the, extinction, of, the, australian, megafauna, by, humans, between, 46, 000, and, 15, 000, years, ago, argued, by, tim, flannery, which, is, similar, to, what, happened, in, the, americas, the, continued, use, of, stone, age, tools, in, australia, has, been, much, debated, the, population, brought, to, south, asia, by, coastal, migration, appears, to, have, remained, there, for, some, time, during, roughly, 60, 000, to, 50, 000, years, ago, before, spreading, further, throughout, eurasia, this, dispersal, of, early, humans, at, the, beginning, of, the, upper, paleolithic, gave, rise, to, the, major, population, groups, of, the, old, world, and, the, americas, towards, the, west, upper, paleolithic, populations, associated, with, mitochondrial, haplogroup, r, and, its, derivatives, spread, throughout, asia, and, europe, with, a, back, migration, of, m1, to, north, africa, and, the, horn, of, africa, several, millennia, ago, presence, in, europe, is, certain, after, 40, 000, years, ago, possibly, as, early, as, 43, 000, years, ago, rapidly, replacing, the, neanderthal, population, contemporary, europeans, have, neanderthal, ancestry, but, it, seems, likely, that, substantial, interbreeding, with, neanderthals, ceased, before, 47, 000, years, ago, i, e, took, place, before, modern, humans, entered, europe, there, is, evidence, from, mitochondrial, dna, that, modern, humans, have, passed, through, at, least, one, genetic, bottleneck, in, which, genome, diversity, was, drastically, reduced, henry, harpending, has, proposed, that, humans, spread, from, a, geographically, restricted, area, about, 100, 000, years, ago, the, passage, through, the, geographic, bottleneck, and, then, with, a, dramatic, growth, amongst, geographically, dispersed, populations, about, 50, 000, years, ago, beginning, first, in, africa, and, thence, spreading, elsewhere, climatological, and, geological, evidence, suggests, evidence, for, the, bottleneck, the, explosion, of, toba, the, largest, volcanic, eruption, of, the, quaternary, may, have, created, a, 1, 000, year, cold, period, potentially, reducing, human, populations, to, a, few, tropical, refugia, it, has, been, estimated, that, as, few, as, 15, 000, humans, survived, in, such, circumstances, genetic, drift, and, founder, effects, may, have, been, maximised, the, greater, diversity, amongst, african, genomes, may, reflect, the, extent, of, african, refugia, during, the, toba, incident, however, a, recent, review, highlights, that, the, single, source, hypothesis, of, non, african, populations, is, less, consistent, with, ancient, dna, analysis, than, multiple, sources, with, genetic, mixing, across, eurasia, the, recent, expansion, of, anatomically, modern, humans, reached, europe, around, 40, 000, years, ago, from, central, asia, and, the, middle, east, as, a, result, of, cultural, adaption, to, big, game, hunting, of, sub, glacial, steppe, fauna, neanderthals, were, present, both, in, the, middle, east, and, in, europe, and, the, arriving, populations, of, anatomically, modern, humans, also, known, as, cro, magnon, or, european, early, modern, humans, interbred, with, neanderthal, populations, to, a, limited, degree, populations, of, modern, humans, and, neanderthal, overlapped, in, various, regions, such, as, the, iberian, peninsula, and, the, middle, east, interbreeding, may, have, contributed, neanderthal, genes, to, palaeolithic, and, ultimately, modern, eurasians, and, oceanians, an, important, difference, between, europe, and, other, parts, of, the, inhabited, world, was, the, northern, latitude, archaeological, evidence, suggests, humans, whether, neanderthal, or, cro, magnon, reached, sites, in, arctic, russia, by, 40, 000, years, ago, cro, magnon, are, considered, the, first, anatomically, modern, humans, in, europe, they, entered, eurasia, by, the, zagros, mountains, near, present, day, iran, and, eastern, turkey, around, 50, 000, years, ago, with, one, group, rapidly, settling, coastal, areas, around, the, indian, ocean, and, another, migrating, north, to, the, steppes, of, central, asia, modern, human, remains, dating, to, 45, 000, 47, 000, have, been, found, in, germany, while, finds, of, 43, 000, 45, 000, years, ago, have, been, discovered, in, italy, and, britain, as, well, as, in, the, european, russian, arctic, from, 40, 000, years, ago, humans, colonised, the, environment, west, of, the, urals, hunting, reindeer, especially, but, were, faced, with, adaptive, challenges, winter, temperatures, averaged, from, 20, to, 30, c, 4, to, 22, f, with, fuel, and, shelter, scarce, they, travelled, on, foot, and, relied, on, hunting, highly, mobile, herds, for, food, these, challenges, were, overcome, through, technological, innovations, tailored, clothing, from, the, pelts, of, fur, bearing, animals, construction, of, shelters, with, hearths, using, bones, as, fuel, and, digging, ice, cellars, into, the, permafrost, to, store, meat, and, bones, however, from, recent, research, it, is, believed, that, the, ecological, crisis, resulting, from, the, eruption, in, c, 38, 000, bce, of, the, super, volcano, in, the, phlegrean, fields, near, naples, which, left, much, of, eastern, europe, covered, in, ash, wiped, out, both, the, last, neanderthal, and, the, first, homo, sapiens, populations, of, the, early, upper, paleolithic, modern, europeans, of, today, bear, no, trace, of, the, genomes, of, the, first, homo, sapiens, europeans, but, only, of, those, from, after, the, ecological, crisis, of, 38, 000, bce, modern, humans, then, repopulated, europe, from, the, east, after, the, eruption, and, the, ice, age, that, took, place, from, 38, 000, to, 36, 000, bce, a, mitochondrial, dna, sequence, of, two, cro, magnons, from, the, paglicci, cave, in, italy, dated, to, 23, 000, and, 24, 000, years, old, paglicci, 52, and, 12, identified, the, mtdna, as, haplogroup, n, typical, of, the, latter, group, the, expansion, of, modern, human, population, is, thought, to, have, begun, 45, 000, years, ago, and, it, may, have, taken, 15, 000, 20, 000, years, for, europe, to, be, colonized, during, this, time, the, neanderthals, were, slowly, being, displaced, because, it, took, so, long, for, europe, to, be, occupied, it, appears, that, humans, and, neanderthals, may, have, been, constantly, competing, for, territory, the, neanderthals, had, larger, brains, and, were, larger, overall, with, a, more, robust, or, heavily, built, frame, which, suggests, that, they, were, physically, stronger, than, modern, homo, sapiens, having, lived, in, europe, for, 200, 000, years, they, would, have, been, better, adapted, to, the, cold, weather, the, anatomically, modern, humans, known, as, the, cro, magnons, with, widespread, trade, networks, superior, technology, and, bodies, likely, better, suited, to, running, would, eventually, completely, displace, the, neanderthals, whose, last, refuge, was, in, the, iberian, peninsula, neanderthals, disappeared, about, 40, 000, years, ago, from, the, extent, of, linkage, disequilibrium, it, was, estimated, that, the, last, neanderthal, gene, flow, into, early, ancestors, of, europeans, occurred, 47, 000, 65, 000, years, bp, in, conjunction, with, archaeological, and, fossil, evidence, interbreeding, is, thought, to, have, occurred, somewhere, in, western, eurasia, possibly, the, middle, east, studies, show, a, higher, neanderthal, admixture, in, east, asians, than, in, europeans, north, african, groups, share, a, similar, excess, of, derived, alleles, with, neanderthals, as, non, african, populations, whereas, sub, saharan, african, groups, are, the, only, modern, human, populations, with, no, substantial, neanderthal, admixture, the, neanderthal, linked, haplotype, b006, of, the, dystrophin, gene, has, also, been, found, among, nomadic, pastoralist, groups, in, the, sahel, and, horn, of, africa, who, are, associated, with, northern, populations, consequently, the, presence, of, this, b006, haplotype, on, the, northern, and, northeastern, perimeter, of, sub, saharan, africa, is, attributed, to, gene, flow, from, a, non, african, point, of, origin, tianyuan, man, an, individual, who, lived, in, china, c, 40, 000, years, ago, showed, substantial, neanderthal, admixture, a, 2017, study, of, the, ancient, dna, of, tianyuan, man, found, that, the, individual, is, related, to, modern, asian, and, native, american, populations, a, 2013, study, found, neanderthal, introgression, of, 18, genes, within, the, chromosome, 3p21, 31, region, hyal, region, of, east, asians, the, introgressive, haplotypes, were, positively, selected, in, only, east, asian, populations, rising, steadily, from, 45, 000, years, ago, until, a, sudden, increase, of, growth, rate, around, 5, 000, to, 3, 500, years, ago, they, occur, at, very, high, frequencies, among, east, asian, populations, in, contrast, to, other, eurasian, populations, e, g, european, and, south, asian, populations, the, findings, also, suggest, that, this, neanderthal, introgression, occurred, within, the, ancestral, population, shared, by, east, asians, and, native, americans, a, 2016, study, presented, an, analysis, of, the, population, genetics, of, the, ainu, people, of, northern, japan, as, key, to, the, reconstruction, of, the, early, peopling, of, east, asia, the, ainu, were, found, to, represent, a, more, basal, branch, than, the, modern, farming, populations, of, east, asia, suggesting, an, ancient, pre, neolithic, connection, with, northeast, siberians, a, 2013, study, associated, several, phenotypical, traits, associated, with, mongoloids, with, a, single, mutation, of, the, edar, gene, dated, to, c, 35, 000, years, ago, mitochondrial, haplogroups, a, b, and, g, originated, about, 50, 000, years, ago, and, bearers, subsequently, colonized, siberia, korea, and, japan, by, about, 35, 000, years, ago, parts, of, these, populations, migrated, to, north, america, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, a, review, paper, by, melinda, a, yang, in, 2022, summarized, and, concluded, that, a, distinctive, basal, east, asian, population, referred, to, as, east, and, southeast, asian, lineage, esea, which, is, ancestral, to, modern, east, asians, southeast, asians, polynesians, and, siberians, originated, in, mainland, southeast, asia, at, 50, 000bc, and, expanded, through, multiple, migration, waves, southwards, and, northwards, respectively, this, esea, lineage, gave, rise, to, various, sublineages, and, is, also, ancestral, to, the, hoabinhian, hunter, gatherers, of, southeast, asia, and, the, 40, 000, year, old, tianyuan, lineage, found, in, northern, china, but, already, differentiated, and, distinct, from, european, related, and, australasian, related, lineages, found, in, other, regions, of, prehistoric, eurasia, the, esea, lineage, trifurcated, from, an, earlier, east, eurasian, or, eastern, non, african, ena, meta, population, which, also, contributed, to, the, formation, of, ancient, ancestral, south, indians, aasi, as, well, as, to, australasians, around, 20, 000, years, ago, approximately, 5, 000, years, after, the, neanderthal, extinction, the, last, glacial, maximum, forced, northern, hemisphere, inhabitants, to, migrate, to, several, shelters, refugia, until, the, end, of, this, period, the, resulting, populations, are, presumed, to, have, resided, in, such, refuges, during, the, lgm, to, ultimately, reoccupy, europe, where, archaic, historical, populations, are, considered, their, descendants, the, composition, of, european, populations, was, later, altered, by, further, migrations, notably, the, neolithic, expansion, from, the, middle, east, and, still, later, the, chalcolithic, population, movements, associated, with, indo, european, expansion, a, paleolithic, site, on, the, yana, river, siberia, at, 71, n, lies, well, above, the, arctic, circle, and, dates, to, 27, 000, radiocarbon, years, before, present, during, glacial, times, this, site, shows, that, people, adapted, to, this, harsh, high, latitude, late, pleistocene, environment, much, earlier, than, previously, thought, paleo, indians, originated, from, central, asia, crossing, the, beringia, land, bridge, between, eastern, siberia, and, present, day, alaska, humans, lived, throughout, the, americas, by, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, or, more, specifically, what, is, known, as, the, late, glacial, maximum, details, of, paleo, indian, migration, to, and, throughout, the, american, continent, including, the, dates, and, the, routes, traveled, are, subject, to, ongoing, research, and, discussion, conventional, estimates, have, it, that, humans, reached, north, america, at, some, point, between, 15, 000, and, 20, 000, years, ago, the, traditional, theory, is, that, these, early, migrants, moved, when, sea, levels, were, significantly, lowered, due, to, the, quaternary, glaciation, following, herds, of, now, extinct, pleistocene, megafauna, along, ice, free, corridors, that, stretched, between, the, laurentide, and, cordilleran, ice, sheets, another, route, proposed, is, that, either, on, foot, or, using, primitive, boats, they, migrated, down, the, pacific, coast, to, south, america, as, far, as, chile, any, archaeological, evidence, of, coastal, occupation, during, the, last, ice, age, would, now, have, been, covered, by, the, sea, level, rise, up, to, a, hundred, metres, since, then, the, recent, finding, of, indigenous, australasian, genetic, markers, in, amazonia, supports, that, a, coastal, route, and, subsequent, isolation, did, occur, with, some, migrants, the, holocene, is, taken, to, begin, 12, 000, years, ago, after, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, maximum, during, the, holocene, climatic, optimum, beginning, about, 9, 000, years, ago, human, populations, which, had, been, geographically, confined, to, refugia, began, to, migrate, by, this, time, most, parts, of, the, globe, had, been, settled, by, h, sapiens, however, large, areas, that, had, been, covered, by, glaciers, were, now, re, populated, this, period, sees, the, transition, from, the, mesolithic, to, the, neolithic, stage, throughout, the, temperate, zone, the, neolithic, subsequently, gives, way, to, the, bronze, age, in, old, world, cultures, and, the, gradual, emergence, of, the, historical, record, in, the, near, east, and, china, beginning, around, 4, 000, years, ago, large, scale, migrations, of, the, mesolithic, to, neolithic, era, are, thought, to, have, given, rise, to, the, pre, modern, distribution, of, the, world, s, major, language, families, such, as, the, niger, congo, nilo, saharan, afro, asiatic, uralic, sino, tibetan, or, indo, european, phyla, the, speculative, nostratic, theory, postulates, the, derivation, of, the, major, language, families, of, eurasia, excluding, sino, tibetan, from, a, single, proto, language, spoken, at, the, beginning, of, the, holocene, period, evidence, published, in, 2014, from, genome, analysis, of, ancient, human, remains, suggests, that, the, modern, native, populations, of, europe, largely, descend, from, three, distinct, lineages, western, hunter, gatherers, derivative, of, the, cro, magnon, population, of, europe, early, european, farmers, introduced, to, europe, from, the, near, east, during, the, neolithic, revolution, and, ancient, north, eurasians, who, expanded, to, europe, in, the, context, of, the, indo, european, expansion, the, ancient, north, eurasian, component, was, introduced, to, western, europe, by, people, related, to, the, yamnaya, culture, additional, ane, ancestry, is, found, in, european, populations, through, paleolithic, interactions, with, eastern, hunter, gatherers, west, eurasian, back, migrations, started, in, the, early, holocene, or, already, earlier, in, the, paleolithic, period, 30, 15kya, followed, by, pre, neolithic, and, neolithic, migration, events, from, the, middle, east, mostly, affecting, northern, africa, the, horn, of, africa, and, wider, regions, of, the, sahel, zone, and, east, africa, the, nilotic, peoples, are, thought, to, be, derived, from, an, earlier, undifferentiated, eastern, sudanic, unity, by, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, the, development, of, the, proto, nilotes, as, a, group, may, have, been, connected, with, their, domestication, of, livestock, the, eastern, sudanic, unity, must, have, been, considerably, earlier, still, perhaps, around, the, 5th, millennium, bce, while, the, proposed, nilo, saharan, unity, would, date, to, the, upper, paleolithic, about, 15kya, the, original, locus, of, the, early, nilotic, speakers, was, presumably, east, of, the, nile, in, what, is, now, south, sudan, the, proto, nilotes, of, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, were, pastoralists, while, their, neighbors, the, proto, central, sudanic, peoples, were, mostly, agriculturalists, the, niger, congo, phylum, is, thought, to, have, emerged, around, 6, 000, years, ago, in, west, or, central, africa, its, expansion, may, have, been, associated, with, the, expansion, of, sahel, agriculture, in, the, african, neolithic, period, following, the, desiccation, of, the, sahara, in, c, 3900, bce, the, bantu, expansion, has, spread, the, bantu, languages, to, central, eastern, and, southern, africa, partly, replacing, the, indigenous, populations, of, these, regions, including, the, african, pygmies, hadza, people, and, san, people, beginning, about, 3, 000, years, ago, it, reached, south, africa, about, 1, 700, years, ago, some, evidence, including, a, 2016, study, by, busby, et, al, suggests, admixture, from, ancient, and, recent, migrations, from, eurasia, into, parts, of, sub, saharan, africa, another, study, ramsay, et, al, 2018, also, shows, evidence, that, ancient, eurasians, migrated, into, africa, and, that, eurasian, admixture, in, modern, sub, saharan, africans, ranges, from, 0, to, 50, varying, by, region, and, generally, higher, in, the, horn, of, africa, and, parts, of, the, sahel, zone, and, found, to, a, lesser, degree, in, certain, parts, of, western, africa, and, southern, africa, excluding, recent, immigrants, the, first, seaborne, human, migrations, were, by, the, austronesian, peoples, originating, from, taiwan, known, as, the, austronesian, expansion, using, advanced, sailing, technologies, like, catamarans, outrigger, boats, and, crab, claw, sails, they, built, the, first, sea, going, ships, and, rapidly, colonized, island, southeast, asia, at, around, 3000, to, 1500, bce, from, the, philippines, and, eastern, indonesia, they, colonized, micronesia, by, 2200, to, 1000, bce, a, branch, of, the, austronesians, reached, island, melanesia, between, 1600, and, 1000, bce, establishing, the, lapita, culture, named, after, the, archaeological, site, in, lapita, new, caledonia, where, their, characteristic, pottery, was, first, discovered, they, are, the, direct, ancestors, of, the, modern, polynesians, they, ventured, into, remote, oceania, reaching, vanuatu, new, caledonia, and, fiji, by, 1200, bce, and, samoa, and, tonga, by, around, 900, to, 800, bce, this, was, the, furthest, extent, of, the, lapita, culture, expansion, during, a, period, of, around, 1, 500, years, they, gradually, lost, the, technology, for, pottery, likely, due, to, the, lack, of, clay, deposits, in, the, islands, replacing, it, with, carved, wooden, and, bamboo, containers, back, migrations, from, the, lapita, culture, also, merged, back, island, southeast, asia, in, 1500, bce, and, into, micronesia, at, around, 200, bce, it, was, not, until, 700, ce, when, they, started, voyaging, further, into, the, pacific, ocean, when, they, colonized, the, cook, islands, the, society, islands, and, the, marquesas, from, there, they, further, colonized, hawaii, by, 900, ce, rapa, nui, by, 1000, ce, and, new, zealand, by, 1200, ce, in, the, indian, ocean, austronesians, from, borneo, also, colonized, madagascar, and, the, comoros, islands, by, around, 500, ce, austronesians, remain, the, dominant, ethnolinguistic, group, of, the, islands, of, the, indo, pacific, and, were, the, first, to, establish, a, maritime, trade, network, reaching, as, far, west, as, east, africa, and, the, arabian, peninsula, they, assimilated, earlier, pleistocene, to, early, holocene, human, overland, migrations, through, sundaland, like, the, papuans, and, the, negritos, in, island, southeast, asia, the, austronesian, expansion, was, the, last, and, the, most, far, reaching, neolithic, human, migration, event, the, caribbean, was, one, of, the, last, places, in, the, americas, that, were, settled, by, humans, the, oldest, remains, are, known, from, the, greater, antilles, cuba, and, hispaniola, dating, between, 4000, and, 3500, bce, and, comparisons, between, tool, technologies, suggest, that, these, peoples, moved, across, the, yucat, n, channel, from, central, america, all, evidence, suggests, that, later, migrants, from, 2000, bce, and, onwards, originated, from, south, america, via, the, orinoco, region, the, descendants, of, these, migrants, include, the, ancestors, of, the, ta, no, and, kalinago, island, carib, peoples, the, earliest, inhabitants, of, north, america, s, central, and, eastern, arctic, are, referred, to, as, the, arctic, small, tool, tradition, ast, and, existed, c, 2500, bce, ast, consisted, of, several, paleo, eskimo, cultures, including, the, independence, cultures, and, pre, dorset, culture, the, inuit, are, the, descendants, of, the, thule, culture, which, emerged, from, western, alaska, around, ce, 1000, and, gradually, displaced, the, dorset, culture
