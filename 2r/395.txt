faridkot, state, in, 1807, however, control, was, restored, to, gulab, singh, of, faridkot, in, 1809, due, to, the, signing, of, a, treaty, between, the, lahore, darbar, and, the, british, east, india, company, while, these, sikh, states, had, been, set, up, by, the, dal, khalsa, they, did, not, become, part, of, the, sikh, empire, there, was, a, mutual, ban, on, warfare, following, the, treaty, of, amritsar, in, 1809, in, which, the, empire, forfeited, the, claim, to, the, cis, sutlej, states, and, the, british, were, not, to, interfere, north, of, the, sutlej, or, in, the, empire, s, existing, territory, south, of, the, sutlej, following, attempts, by, ranjit, singh, to, wrest, control, of, these, states, from, the, british, between, 1806, and, 1809, the, sikh, crossing, of, the, sutlej, following, british, militarization, of, the, border, with, punjab, from, 2, 500, men, and, six, guns, in, 1838, to, 17, 612, men, and, 66, guns, in, 1844, and, 40, 523, men, and, 94, guns, in, 1845, and, plans, on, using, the, newly, conquered, territory, of, sindh, as, a, springboard, to, advance, on, the, sikh, held, region, of, multan, eventually, resulted, in, conflict, with, the, british, after, ranjit, singh, s, death, in, 1839, the, empire, was, severely, weakened, by, internal, divisions, and, political, mismanagement, this, opportunity, was, used, by, the, british, east, india, company, to, launch, the, first, anglo, sikh, war, the, battle, of, ferozeshah, in, 1845, marked, many, turning, points, the, british, encountered, the, punjab, army, opening, with, a, gun, duel, in, which, the, sikhs, had, the, better, of, the, british, artillery, as, the, british, made, advances, europeans, in, their, army, were, specially, targeted, as, the, sikhs, believed, if, the, army, became, demoralized, the, backbone, of, the, enemy, s, position, would, be, broken, the, fighting, continued, throughout, the, night, the, british, position, grew, graver, as, the, night, wore, on, and, suffered, terrible, casualties, with, every, single, member, of, the, governor, general, s, staff, either, killed, or, wounded, nevertheless, the, british, army, took, and, held, ferozeshah, british, general, sir, james, hope, grant, recorded, truly, the, night, was, one, of, gloom, and, forbidding, and, perhaps, never, in, the, annals, of, warfare, has, a, british, army, on, such, a, large, scale, been, nearer, to, a, defeat, which, would, have, involved, annihilation, the, reasons, for, the, withdrawal, of, the, sikhs, from, ferozeshah, are, contentious, some, believe, that, it, was, treachery, of, the, non, sikh, high, command, of, their, own, army, which, led, to, them, marching, away, from, a, british, force, in, a, precarious, and, battered, state, others, believe, that, a, tactical, withdrawal, was, the, best, policy, the, sikh, empire, was, finally, dissolved, at, the, end, of, the, second, anglo, sikh, war, in, 1849, into, separate, princely, states, and, the, british, province, of, punjab, eventually, a, lieutenant, governorship, was, formed, in, lahore, as, a, direct, representative, of, the, british, crown, the, empire, s, ruling, court, based, out, of, lahore, is, termed, the, lahore, darbar, or, khalsa, darbar, faqir, saifuddin, of, the, fakir, khana, museum, prefers, to, use, the, term, punjab, darbar, rather, than, khalsa, darbar, owing, to, the, large, role, muslims, played, in, ranjit, singh, s, court, the, ruling, court, was, diverse, and, under, the, ultimate, command, of, the, ruling, maharaja, whom, was, the, drum, of, the, khalsa, in, theory, the, sikh, court, was, based, on, the, khalsa, ideals, propounded, by, guru, gobind, singh, yet, the, court, was, secular, in, practice, as, an, example, of, this, secularism, members, of, the, court, came, from, various, religious, background, including, sikhs, hindus, muslims, and, christians, furthermore, the, members, also, came, from, various, ethnic, regional, and, caste, backgrounds, such, as, dogras, rajputs, brahmins, jats, and, europeans, whilst, ranjit, singh, himself, preferred, to, dress, modestly, the, sikh, court, was, filled, with, elaborately, garbed, and, decorated, members, only, three, individuals, were, permitted, to, be, seated, on, chairs, within, the, durbar, them, namely, being, heir, apparent, kharak, singh, kanwar, sher, singh, and, raja,

seated, behind, the, maharaja, was, raja, dhian, singh, the, rest, of, the, members, of, the, court, were, seated, as, per, their, rank, and, status, the, colours, of, the, sikh, court, were, yellow, and, green, thus, most, of, its, members, donned, yellow, coloured, dressings, made, from, kashmiri, silk, or, woollens, however, there, existed, no, strict, categorization, scheme, of, the, rankings, of, the, constituent, members, of, the, lahore, darbar, thus, the, rankings, of, its, members, was, determined, by, the, level, of, trust, the, maharaja, held, in, them, the, court, also, granted, awards, upon, its, members, with, most, of, these, essentially, being, bestowed, titles, in, the, form, of, honourifics, however, some, members, were, granted, jagirs, estate, grant, laziness, was,
