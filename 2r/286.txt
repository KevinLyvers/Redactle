when, the, territory, was, suppressed, during, the, 1795, partitions, of, poland, lithuania, the, state, was, founded, by, lithuanians, who, were, at, the, time, a, polytheistic, nation, of, several, united, baltic, tribes, from, auk, taitija, by, 1440, the, grand, duchy, had, become, the, largest, european, state, controlling, an, area, from, the, baltic, sea, in, the, north, to, the, black, sea, in, the, south, the, grand, duchy, expanded, to, include, large, portions, of, the, former, kievan, rus, and, other, neighbouring, states, including, what, is, now, belarus, lithuania, most, of, ukraine, as, well, as, parts, of, latvia, moldova, poland, and, russia, at, its, greatest, extent, in, the, 15th, century, it, was, the, largest, state, in, europe, it, was, a, multi, ethnic, and, multiconfessional, state, with, great, diversity, in, languages, religion, and, cultural, heritage, the, consolidation, of, the, lithuanian, lands, began, in, the, late, 13th, century, mindaugas, the, first, ruler, of, the, grand, duchy, was, crowned, as, the, catholic, king, of, lithuania, in, 1253, the, pagan, state, was, targeted, in, a, religious, crusade, by, the, teutonic, knights, and, the, livonian, order, but, survived, its, rapid, territorial, expansion, started, late, in, the, reign, of, gediminas, and, continued, under, the, diarchy, and, co, leadership, of, his, sons, algirdas, and, k, stutis, algirdas, s, son, jogaila, signed, the, union, of, krewo, in, 1386, bringing, two, major, changes, in, the, history, of, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, conversion, to, christianity, of, europe, s, last, pagan, state, and, establishment, of, a, dynastic, union, between, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, and, the, crown, of, the, kingdom, of, poland, this, marked, the, beginning, of, the, rule, of, other, countries, by, the, patrilineal, members, of, the, lithuanian, ruling, gediminids, dynasty, who, since, the, 14th, 15th, centuries, ruled, not, only, lithuania, but, also, poland, hungary, croatia, bohemia, and, moldavia, the, reign, of, vytautas, the, great, son, of, k, stutis, marked, both, the, greatest, territorial, expansion, of, the, grand, duchy, it, became, one, of, the, largest, countries, territorially, in, europe, and, the, defeat, of, the, teutonic, knights, in, the, battle, of, grunwald, in, 1410, it, also, marked, the, rise, of, the, lithuanian, nobility, after, vytautas, s, death, lithuania, s, relationship, with, the, kingdom, of, poland, greatly, deteriorated, lithuanian, noblemen, including, the, radvila, family, attempted, to, break, the, personal, union, with, poland, however, unsuccessful, wars, with, the, grand, duchy, of, moscow, forced, the, union, to, remain, intact, eventually, the, union, of, lublin, of, 1569, created, a, new, state, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, in, the, federation, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, maintained, its, political, distinctiveness, and, had, separate, ministries, laws, army, and, treasury, the, federation, was, terminated, by, the, passing, of, the, constitution, of, 3, may, 1791, when, it, was, supposed, to, become, a, single, country, the, commonwealth, under, one, monarch, one, parliament, and, no, lithuanian, autonomy, shortly, afterward, the, unitary, character, of, the, state, was, confirmed, by, adopting, the, reciprocal, guarantee, of, two, nations, however, the, newly, reformed, commonwealth, was, invaded, by, russia, in, 1792, and, partitioned, between, neighbouring, states, a, truncated, state, whose, principal, cities, were, krak, w, warsaw, and, vilnius, remained, that, was, nominally, independent, after, the, ko, ciuszko, uprising, the, territory, was, completely, partitioned, among, the, russian, empire, the, kingdom, of, prussia, and, austria, in, 1795, the, name, of, lithuania, litua, was, first, mentioned, in, 1009, in, annals, of, quedlinburg, some, older, etymological, theories, relate, the, name, to, a, small, river, not, far, from, kernav, the, core, area, of, the, early, lithuanian, state, and, a, possible, first, capital, of, the, would, be, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, is, usually, credited, as, the, source, of, the, name, this, river, s, original, name, is, lietava, as, time, passed, the, suffix, ava, could, have, changed, into, uva, as, the, two, are, from, the, same, suffix, branch, the, river, flows, in, the, lowlands, and, easily, spills, over, its, banks, therefore, the, traditional, lithuanian, form, liet, could, be, directly, translated, as, lietis, to, spill, of, the, root, derived, from, the, proto, indo, european, ley, however, the, river, is, very, small, and, some, find, it, improbable, that, such, a, small, and, local, object, could, have, lent, its, name, to, an, entire, nation, on, the, other, hand, such, a, fact, is, not, unprecedented, in, world, history, a, credible, modern, theory, of, etymology, of, the, name, of, lithuania, lithuanian, lietuva, is, art, ras, dubonis, s, hypothesis, that, lietuva, relates, to, the, word, lei, iai, plural, of, leitis, a, social, group, of, warriors, knights, in, the, early, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, the, title, of, the, grand, duchy, was, consistently, applied, to, lithuania, from, the, 14th, century, onward, in, other, languages, the, grand, duchy, is, referred, to, as, naming, convention, of, both, title, of, ruler, hospodar, and, the, state, changed, as, it, expanded, its, territory, following, the, decline, of, the, kingdom, of, ruthenia, and, incorporation, of, its, lands, into, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, gediminas, started, to, title, himself, as, king, of, lithuanians, and, many, ruthenians, while, the, name, of, the, state, became, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, and, ruthenia, similarly, the, title, changed, to, king, of, lithuanians, and, ruthenians, ruler, and, duke, of, semigallia, when, semigallia, became, part, of, the, state, the, 1529, edition, of, the, statute, of,

called, the, republic, of, lithuania, latin, respublica, lituana, since, at, least, the, mid, 16th, century, already, before, the, union, of, lublin, in, 1569, the, first, mention, of, the, name, lithuania, is, found, in, the, annals, of, quedlinburg, which, describes, the, missionary, expedition, of, bruno, of, querfurt, to, yotvingians, in, the, 12th, century, slavic, chronicles, refer, to, lithuania, as, one, of, the, areas, attacked, by, the, rus, pagan, lithuanians, initially, paid, tribute, to, polotsk, but, they, soon, grew, in, strength, and, organized, their, own, small, scale, raids, at, some, point, between, 1180, and, 1183, the, situation, began, to, change, and, the, lithuanians, started, to, organize, sustainable, military, raids, on, the, slavic, provinces, raiding, the, principality, of, polotsk, as, well, as, pskov, and, even, threatening, novgorod, the, sudden, spark, of, military, raids, marked, consolidation, of, the, lithuanian, lands, in, auk, taitija,

baltic, tribes, and, further, galvanized, the, formation, of, the, lithuanian, state, the, peace, treaty, with, galicia, volhynia, of, 1219, provides, evidence, of, cooperation, between, lithuanians,

dukes, from, emaitija, although, they, had, battled, in, the, past, the, lithuanians, and, the, emai, iai, now, faced, a, common, enemy, likely, ivinbudas, had, the, most, authority, and, at, least, several, dukes, were, from, the, same, families, the, formal, acknowledgement, of, common, interests, and, the, establishment, of, a, hierarchy, among, the, signatories, of, the, treaty, foreshadowed,

the, battle, of, skuodas, in, 1259, and, the, battle, of, durbe, in, 1260, this, encouraged, the, conquered, semigallians, and, old, prussians, to, rebel, against, the, knights, encouraged, by,

left, mostly, untouched, the, weak, control, of, the, mongols, over, the, areas, they, had, conquered, allowed, the, expansion, of, lithuania, to, accelerate, rus, principalities, were, never, incorporated, directly, into, the, golden, horde, maintaining, vassal, relationships, with, a, fair, degree, of, independence, lithuania, annexed, some, of, these, areas, as, vassals, through, diplomacy, as, they, exchanged, rule, by, the, mongols, or, the, grand, prince, of, moscow, with, rule, by, the, grand, duchy, an, example, is, novgorod, which, was, often, in, the, lithuanian, sphere, of, influence, and, became, an, occasional, dependency, of, the, grand, duchy, lithuanian, control, resulted, from, internal, frictions, within, the, city, which, attempted, to, escape, submission, to, moscow, such, relationships, could, be, tenuous, however, as, changes, in, a, city, s, internal, politics, could, disrupt, lithuanian, control, as, happened, on, a, number, of, occasions, with, novgorod, and, other, east, slavic, cities, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, managed, to, hold, off, mongol, incursions, and, eventually, secured, gains, in, 1333, and, 1339,

thereafter, in, 1387, moldavia, became, a, vassal, of, poland, and, in, a, broader, sense, of, lithuania, by, this, time, lithuania, had, conquered, the, territory, of, the, golden, horde, all, the, way, to, the, dnieper, river, in, a, crusade, against, the, golden, horde, in, 1398, in, an, alliance, with, tokhtamysh, lithuania, invaded, northern, crimea, and, won, a, decisive, victory, in, an,

founded, many, catholic, churches, and, allocated, lands, for, parishes, in, lithuania, the, state, reached, a, peak, becoming, one, of, the, largest, countries, territorially, in, europe, under,

history, of, europe, was, finally, ended, vytautas, backed, the, economic, development, of, the, state, and, introduced, many, reforms, under, his, rule, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, slowly, became, more, centralized, as, the, governours, loyal, to, vytautas, replaced, local, princes, with, dynastic, ties, to, the, throne, the, governours, were, rich, landowners, who, formed, the, basis, for, the, nobility, of, the, grand, duchy, during, vytautas, rule, the, radziwi, and, go, tautas, families, started, to, gain, influence, in, 1440, casimir, iv, jagiellon, was, sent, by, his, older, brother, w, adys, aw, iii, to, lithuania, to, rule, in, his, name, however, instead, a, manifestation, of, the, sovereignty, of, lithuania, occurred, when, casimir, was, elected, as, the, grand, duke, of, lithuania, upon, his, arrival, to, vilnius, on, 29, june, 1440, and, subsequently, titled, himself, as, a, free, lord, pan, dominus, this, way, breaching, the, agreements, of, the, union, of, grodno, 1432, and, terminating, the, polish, lithuanian, union, casimir, also, became, the, king, of, poland, in, 1447, following, casimir, s, death, in, 1492, the, factual, termination, of, the, polish, lithuanian, union, also, occurred, during, the, reign, of, casimir, s, sons, alexander, jagiellon, and, john, i, albert, who, had, respectively, ruled, lithuania, and, poland, separately, in, 1492, 1501, the, rapid, expansion, of, the, influence, of, moscow, soon, put, it, into, a, comparable, position, to, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, and, after, the, annexation, of, novgorod, republic, in, 1478, muscovy, was, among, the, preeminent, states, in, northeastern, europe, between, 1492, and, 1508, ivan, iii, further, consolidated, muscovy, winning, the, key, battle, of, vedrosha, and, capturing, such, ancient, lands, of, kievan, rus, as, chernihiv, and, bryansk, on, 8, september, 1514, the, allied, forces, of, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, and, the, kingdom, of, poland, under, the, command, of, hetman, konstanty, ostrogski, fought, the, battle, of, orsha, against, the, army, of, the, grand, duchy, of, moscow, under, konyushy, ivan, chelyadnin, and, kniaz, mikhail, golitsin, the, battle, was, part, of, a, long, series, of, muscovite, lithuanian, wars, conducted, by, russian, rulers, striving, to, gather, all, the, former, lands, of, kievan, rus, under, their, rule, according, to, rerum, moscoviticarum, commentarii, by, sigismund, von, herberstein, the, primary, source, for, the, information, on, the, battle, the, much, smaller, army, of, poland, lithuania, under, 30, 000, men, defeated, the, 80, 000, muscovite, soldiers, capturing, their, camp, and, commander, the, muscovites, lost, about, 30, 000, men, while, the, losses, of, the, poland, lithuania, army, totalled, only, 500, while, the, battle, is, remembered, as, one, of, the, greatest, lithuanian, victories, muscovy, ultimately, prevailed, in, the, war, under, the, 1522, peace, treaty, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, made, large, territorial, concessions, the, wars, with, the, teutonic, order, the, loss, of, land, to, moscow, and, the, continued, pressure, threatened, the, survival, of, the, state, of, lithuania, so, it, was, forced, to, ally, more, closely, with, poland, forming, a, real, union, with, the, kingdom, of, poland, in, the, union, of, lublin, of, 1569, the, union, was, formally, called, the, kingdom, of, poland, and, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, however, now, commonly, known, as, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, during, the, period, of, the, union, many, of, the, territories, formerly, controlled, by, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, were, transferred, to, the, crown, of, the, polish, kingdom, while, the, gradual, process, of, polonization, slowly, drew, lithuania, itself, under, polish, domination, following, the, death, of, grand, duke, sigismund, ii, augustus, in, 1572, a, joint, polish, lithuanian, monarch, was, to, be, elected, as, in, the, union, of, lublin, it, was, agreed, that, the, title, grand, duke, of, lithuania, will, be, received, by, a, jointly, elected, monarch, in, the, election, sejm, on, his, accession, to, the, throne, thus, losing, its, former, institutional, significance, however, the, union, of, lublin, guaranteed, that, the, institution, and, the, title, grand, duke, of, lithuania, will, be, preserved, in, 1573, henry, valua, was, elected, as, the, first, joint, polish, lithuanian, monarch, however, his, rule, was, short, and, he, never, personally, visited, the, grand, duchy,

alexander, vi, reprimanded, the, grand, duke, for, keeping, non, catholics, as, advisers, consequently, only, in, 1563, did, grand, duke, sigismund, ii, augustus, issue, a, privilege, that, equalized, the, rights, of, orthodox, and, catholics, in, lithuania, and, abolished, all, previous, restrictions, on, orthodox, there, was, an, effort, to, polarise, orthodox, christians, after, the, union, of,

lithuania, proper, which, included, the, voivodeships, of, vilnius, trakai, and, samogitia, spoke, lithuanian, these, areas, remained, almost, wholly, lithuanian, speaking, both, colloquially, and, by, ruling, nobility, despite, its, frequent, oral, use, lithuanian, did, not, begin, to, be, used, in, writing, until, the, 16th, century, ruthenians, ancestors, of, modern, belarusians, and,

orthodox, church, was, old, church, slavonic, while, official, documents, used, the, so, called, chancery, ruthenian, close, to, but, not, identical, to, the, spoken, language, which, over, time, absorbed, many, lithuanian, and, polish, words, some, poles, mainly, burghers, clergy, merchants, and, szlachta, moved, to, lithuania, although, this, migration, was, small, scale, after, the, union, of, lublin, this, movement, significantly, increased, polish, was, adopted, also, gradually, by, the, local, inhabitants, already, in, early, 16th, century, polish, became, the, lithuanian, magnates,

and, even, the, peasants, since, the, 16th, century, polish, was, used, much, more, often, than, other, languages, for, writing, polish, finally, became, the, commonwealth, s, official, chancellery,

duchy, s, linguistic, and, ethnic, situation, as, well, as, the, fusion, of, lithuanian, and, ruthenian, elements, in, its, culture, became, the, trigger, for, a, long, running, debate, among, historians, from, lithuania, belarus, and, ukraine, over, whether, the, state, was, essentially, lithuanian, or, ruthenian, lithuanian, in, which, the, more, advanced, ruthenian, culture, played, a, central, role, before, the, lithuanian, expansion, into, the, ruthenian, lands, lithuanian, was, the, only, language, of, public, life, however, the, conquests, already, initiated, by, mindaugas, in, 13th, century, began, the, process, of, fusing, ruthenian, and, lithuanian, culture, and, in, the, absence, of, its, own, writing, tradition, adopting, ruthenian, as, the, language, of, administration, and, written, communication, from, at, least, the, time, of, vytautas, but, probably, much, earlier, the, language, of, internal, administration, was, chancery, ruthenian, a, language, similar, to, but, not, the, same, as, the, spoken, language, used, by, ruthenians, living, in, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, as, for, the, correspondences, with, foreign, courts, the, grand,

with, the, east, slavic, and, tatar, rulers, the, language, used, at, court, continued, to, be, lithuanian, until, the, mid, 16th, century, the, other, being, ruthenian, later, both, languages, began, to, be, replaced, by, polish, ruthenian, culture, dominated, the, courts, of, the, gediminid, princes, since, the, 14th, century, especially, those, ruling, directly, over, ruthenian, subjects, grand, duke, jogaila, was, most, likely, bilingual, knowing, and, speaking, lithuanian, and, ruthenian, and, was, able, to, communicate, in, the, samogitian, dialect, of, the, lithuanian, language, the, lithuanian, language, was, still, strongly, present, at, the, vilnius, court, of, casimir, jagiellon, who, had, to, learn, it, when, he, assumed, power, in, the, grand, duchy, in, 1444, casimir, s, assumption, of, power, in, poland, in, 1447, marked, the, end, of, the, existence, of, a, separate, court, in, vilnius, it, later, existed, only, in, years, 1492, 1496, and, 1544, 1548, many, lithuanians, and, ruthenian, nobles, joined, the, court, in, krak, w, they, learned, polish, language, over, time, casimir, was, the, last, grand, duke, to, know, the, lithuanian, language, from, 1500, the, elite, of, the, lithuanian, state, rapidly, adopted, the, polish, language, the, process, of, moving, away, from, ruthenian, to, polish, in, administration, was, soon, apparent, the, first, were, the, nobles, of, podlachia, who, adopted, polish, laws, as, early, as, the, 1440s, and, repeatedly, demanded, that, official, documents, be, written, in, polish, since, they, no, longer, knew, ruthenian, the, political, reforms, of, 1564, 1566, established, sejmiks, local, land, courts, appellate, courts, modelled, on, polish, system, through, which, the, polish, language, flowed, into, lithuania, the, first, codification, of, lithuanian, laws, the, statute, of, lithuania, was, issued, in, chancery, ruthenian, 1529, but, was, quickly, translated, into, latin, 1530, and, polish, 1532, court, chancellor, of, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, lew, sapieha, noted, in, the, preface, of, the, third, statute, of, lithuania, 1588, that, all, state, documents, to, be, written, exclusively, in, ruthenian, despite, this, after, the, polish, translation, of, the, statute, was, published, in, 1614, it, was, not, reissued, in, ruthenian, ever, again, polish, was, increasingly, used, in, official, documents, especially, after, the, union, of, lublin, finally, in, 1697, the, sejm, as, part, of, the, equalization, of, law, between, lithuania, and, poland, confirmed, that, only, the, polish, language, was, to, be, used, in, administration, in, lithuania, although, ruthenian, continued, to, be, used, on, a, few, official, documents, until, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, after, the, baptism, the, use, of, latin, still, the, main, language, of, learning, and, writing, in, western, europe, also, spread, in, lithuania, as, a, language, of, document, latin, was, the, second, language, of, the, grand, ducal, chancellery, in, the, 14th, 16th, centuries, although, it, was, used, less, frequently, than, ruthenian, in, internal, administration, this, was, accompanied, by, the, spread, since, mid, 15th, century, of, the, legend, of, the, roman, origin, of, the, lithuanian, nobility, from, the, palemon, lineage, and, the, closeness, of, the, lithuanian, language, and, latin, this, let, some, intellectuals, in, the, mid, 16th, century, to, advocate, for, replacement, of, ruthenian, with, latin, as, they, considered, latin, as, the, native, language, of, lithuanians, despite, the, appearance, of, literature, in, lithuanian, in, the, 16th, century, the, language, did, not, gain, the, status, of, a, chancellery, language, in, the, grand, duchy, until, the, late, 18th, century, unlike, neighboring, prussia, where, the, custom, of, issuing, official, documents, in, lithuanian, especially, those, addressed, to, lithuanian, subjects, appeared, as,
