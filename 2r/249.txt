intention, was, described, in, his, own, words, when, he, arrived, to, malacca, if, they, were, only, to, take, malaca, out, of, the, hands, of, the, moors, cairo, and, mecca, would, be, entirely, ruined, and, venice, would, then, be, able, to, obtain, no, spiceries, except, what, her, merchants, might, buy, in, portugal, the, portuguese, launch, their, first, attack, on, 25, july, 1511, but, this, was, met, with, failure, albuquerque, then, launched, another, attack, on, 15, august, 1511, which, proved, successful, as, malacca, was, captured, on, that, day, the, portuguese, constructed, a, fortress, called, a, famosa, using, rocks, and, stones, taken, from, muslim, graves, mosques, and, other, buildings, several, churches, and, convents, a, bishop, s, palace, and, administrative,

malacca, remained, under, portuguese, control, for, the, next, 130, years, despite, incessant, attempts, by, the, former, rulers, of, malacca, and, other, regional, powers, to, dislodge, them, see, malay, portuguese, conflicts, around, the, foothill, on, which, the, sultan, s, istana, palace, once, stood, the, portuguese, built, the, stone, fort, known, as, a, famosa, completed, in, 1512, malay, graves, the, mosque, and, other, buildings, were, dismantled, to, obtain, the, stone, that, was, used, to, build, the, fort, despite, numerous, attacks, the, fort, was, only, breached, once, when, the, dutch, and, johor, defeated, the, portuguese, in, 1641, it, soon, became, clear, that, portuguese, control, of, malacca, did, not, mean, they, controlled, the, asian, trade, centred, on, it, their, rule, in, malacca, was, marred, with, difficulties, they, could, not, become, self, sufficient, and, remained, highly, dependent, on, asian, suppliers, as, had, their, malay, predecessors, they, were, short, of, both, funds, and, manpower, and, the, administration, was, hampered, by, organizational, confusion, and, command, overlap, corruption, and, inefficiency, competition, from, other, regional, ports, such, as, johor, which, was, founded, by, the, exiled, sultan, of, malacca, saw, asian, traders, bypass, malacca, and, the, city, began, to, decline, as, a, trading, port,

exchange, that, policed, the, strait, of, malacca, to, maintain, its, safety, for, commercial, traffic, was, replaced, with, scattered, trading, network, with, multiple, ports, rivalling, each, other, in, the, strait, the, efforts, to, propagate, christianity, which, was, also, one, of, the, principal, aims, of, portuguese, imperialism, did, not, meet, with, much, success, primarily, because,

went, through, an, evolutionary, process, the, legal, rules, that, eventually, evolved, were, shaped, by, three, main, influences, namely, the, early, non, indigenous, hindu, buddhist, tradition, islam, and, the, indigenous, adat, whether, the, first, ruler, of, malacca, parameswara, converted, to, islam, is, unknown, as, there, is, no, evidence, to, suggest, that, he, had, the, 16th, century, portuguese, writer, tom, pires, explicitly, mentioned, that, parameswara, was, succeeded, by, his, son, megat, iskandar, shah, who, only, converted, to, islam, at, age, 72, on, the, other, hand, the, malay, annals, noted, that, it, was, during, the, reign, of, the, third, ruler, muhammad, shah, r, 1424, 1444, that, the, ruling, class, and, their, subjects, began, accepting, islam, while, there, are, differing, views, on, when, the, islamization, of, malacca, actually, took, place, it, is, generally, agreed, that, islam, was, firmly, established, during, the, reign, of, muzaffar, shah, r, 1445, 1459, islamisation, in, the, region, surrounding, malacca, gradually, intensified, between, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, through, study, centres, in, upeh, the, district, on, the, north, bank, of, the, malacca, river, islam, spread, from, malacca, to, jambi, kampar, bengkalis, siak, aru, and, the, karimun, islands, in, sumatra, throughout, much, of, the, malay, peninsula, java, and, the, philippines, the, malay, annals, mention, that, the, courts, of, malacca, and, pasai, posed, theological, questions, and, problems, to, one, another, of, the, so, called, wali, sanga, responsible, for, spreading, islam, on, java, at, least, two, sunan, bonang, and, sunan, kalijaga, are, said, to, have, studied, in, malacca, tom, pires, mentions, in, his, suma, oriental, that, the, rulers, of, kampar, and, indragiri, on, the, east, coast, of, sumatra, converted, to, islam, as, a, result, of, sultan, muzaffar, shah, s, influence, and, went, on, to, study, the, religion, in, malacca, the, malay, annals, also, mentions, a, number, of, scholars, who, served, at, the, malacca, royal, court, as, teachers, and, counselors, to, the, various, sultans, maulana, abu, bakar, served, in, the, court, of, sultan, mansur, shah, and, introduced, the, kitab, darul, manzum, a, theological, text, translated, from, the, work, of, an, arab, scholar, in, mecca, a, scholar, by, the, name, of, maulana, kadi, sardar, johan, served, as, a, religious, teacher, to, both, sultan, mahmud, shah, and, his, son, in, addition, to, kitab, darul, manzum, the, malay, annals, also, mentions, the, kitab, al, luma, fi, tasawwuf, book, of, flashes, a, tenth, century, treatise, on, sufism, by, abu, nasr, al, sarraj, certain, elaborate, ceremonies, that, blend, islamic, traditions, with, local, culture, were, also, created, in, the, malacca, sultanate, one, example, was, recorded, during, the, reign, of, muhammad, shah, a, special, ceremony, was, held, that, marked, the, celebration, of, the, 27th, night, of, ramadan, the, laylat, al, qadr, it, began, with, a, daytime, procession, led, by, the, temenggung, on, elephant, back, conveying, the, sultan, s, prayer, mat, to, the, mosque, for, tarawih, performed, after, the, mandatory, night, prayers, on, the, following, day, the, sultan, s, turban, would, be, carried, in, procession, to, the, mosque, similar, ceremonies, accompanied, the, grand, celebrations, of, both, hari, raya, aidilfitri, and, hari, raya, aidiladha, apparently, malaccan, malay, society, had, become, so, infused, with, the, islamic, worldview, that, on, the, eve, of, the, fall, of, malacca, warriors, at, the, court, requested, copies, of, two, islamic, heroic, epics, the, hikayat, amir, hamzah, and, the, hikayat, muhammad, hanafiah, to, inspire, them, in, battle, the, next, day, the, rise, of, malacca, as, a, centre, of, islam, had, a, number, of, implications, firstly, islam, transformed, the, notion, of, kingship, so, that, the, sultan, was, no, longer, viewed, as, divine, but, as, god, s, khalifah, secondly, islam, was, an, important, factor, in, enabling, malacca, to, foster, good, relations, with, other, islamic, polities, including, the, ottoman, empire, thereby, attracting, muslim, traders, to, malacca, thirdly, islam, brought, many, great, transformation, into, malaccan, society, and, culture, and, ultimately, it, became, a, definitive, marker, of, a, malay, identity, this, identity, was, in, turn, enriched, further, through, the, standards, set, by, malacca, in, some, important, aspects, of, traditional, malay, culture, notably, in, literature, architecture, culinary, traditions, traditional, dress, performing, arts, martial, arts, and, royal, court, traditions, over, time, this, common, malay, cultural, idiom, came, to, characterise, much, of, maritime, southeast, asia, through, malayisation, malacca, developed, from, a, small, settlement, to, a, cosmopolitan, entrep, t, within, the, span, of, a, century, this, rapid, progression, was, attributable, to, several, factors, key, among, which, were, its, strategic, location, along, one, of, the, world, s, most, important, shipping, lanes, the, strait, of, malacca, and, the, increasing, demand, for, commodities, from, both, the, east, and, the, west, ships, from, the, east, bearing, goods, from, china, the, ryukyu, islands, java, and, the, maluku, islands, would, sail, in, by, the, northeast, monsoon, from, december, to, january, while, ships, leaving, for, ports, along, indian, coastline, the, red, sea, and, east, africa, would, sail, with, the, southwest, monsoon, there, were, other, ports, along, the, strait, of, malacca, such, as, kedah, in, the, peninsula, and, jambi, and, palembang, in, sumatra, yet, none, of, them, came, close, to, challenging, malacca, s, success, as, a, centre, of, international, trade, malacca, had, an, edge, over, these, ports, because, its, rulers, created, an, environment, that, was, safe, and, conducive, for, business, chinese, records, of, the, mid, 15th, century, stated, that, malacca, flourished, as, a, centre, for, trade, on, account, of, its, effective, security, measures, it, also, had, a, well, equipped, and, well, managed, port, among, the, facilities, provided, for, merchants, were, warehouses, where, they, could, safely, house, their, goods, as, they, awaited, favourable, trade, winds, as, well, as, elephants, for, transporting, goods, to, the, warehouses, to, administer, the, cosmopolitan, marketplace, the, traders, were, grouped, according, to, region, and, placed, under, one, of, four, shahbandars, malacca, had, few, domestic, products, with, which, to, trade, it, produced, small, amounts, of, tin, and, gold, as, well, as, dried, fish, yet, even, the, salt, for, preserving, the, fish, had, to, be, sourced, from, elsewhere, in, the, region, basic, goods, including, vegetables, cattle, and, fish, were, supplied, by, malacca, s, trading, partners, rice, mainly, for, local, consumption, was, imported, much, of, the, mercantile, activity, in, malacca, therefore, relied, on, the, flow, of, goods, from, other, parts, of, the, region, among, malacca, s, most, crucial, functions, was, its, role, as, both, a, collection, centre, for, cloves, nutmeg, and, mace, from, the, maluku, islands, and, a, redistribution, centre, for, cotton, textiles, from, ports, in, gujarat, the, coromandel, coast, malabar, coast, and, bengal, other, goods, traded, in, malacca, included, porcelain, silk, and, iron, from, china, and, natural, products, of, the, malay, archipelago, such, as, camphor, sandalwood, spices, fish, fish, roe, and, seaweed, from, the, coastal, regions, on, both, sides, of, straint, of, malacca, came, forest, products, rattan, resin, roots, and, wax, and, some, gold, and, tin, these, goods, were, then, shipped, to, ports, west, of, malacca, especially, gujarat, tin, ingots, were, a, trading, currency, unique, to, malacca, cast, in, the, shape, of, a, peck, each, block, weighs, just, over, one, pound, ten, blocks, made, up, one, unit, called, a, small, bundle, and, 40, blocks, made, up, one, large, bundle, gold, and, silver, coins, were, also, issued, by, malacca, as, a, trading, currency, within, the, sultanate, the, malacca, sultanate, heralded, the, golden, age, of, the, malay, world, and, became, an, important, port, in, the, far, east, during, the, 16th, century, it, became, so, rich, that, tom, pires, said, whoever, is, lord, of, malacca, shall, have, his, hands, on, the, throat, of, venice, within, a, span, of, a, century, the, sultanate, left, a, lasting, and, important, legacy, especially, within, malay, culture, and, the, history, of, malaysia, malacca, was, the, first, malay, muslim, state, that, achieved, the, status, of, a, regional, maritime, power, despite, the, existence, of, earlier, muslim, kingdoms, such, as, kedah, samudra, pasai, and, aru, which, also, possessed, well, established, ports, none, of, them, came, close, in, challenging, malacca, s, success, in, expanding, its, territory, and, influence, in, the, region, malacca, also, contributed, to, the, evolution, of, a, common, malay, culture, based, on, islam, by, incorporating, native, and, hindu, buddhist, ideas, and, layered, them, extensively, with, islamic, ideas, and, values, through, its, traditions, laws, and, royal, rituals, and, customs, the, malaccan, court, set, an, example, for, later, muslim, sultanates, in, the, region, to, follow, malacca, is, important, to, the, modern, nation, of, malaysia, as, it, was, the, first, centralised, polity, that, consolidated, the, entire, malay, peninsula, under, its, rule, because, of, these, roles, malacca, is, considered, by, many, to, be, the, spiritual, birthplace, of, malaysia, after, the, sultanate, of, malacca, fell, to, portugal, in, 1511, mahmud, shah, retreated, to, kampar, sumatra, he, left, behind, a, prince, named, sultan, alauddin, riayat, shah, ii, who, went, on, to, establish, the, sultanate, of, johor, the, malacca, sultanate, also, emerged, as, the, primary, base, in, continuing, the, historic, struggles, of, its, predecessors, singapura, and, srivijaya, against, their, java, based, rivals, by, the, mid, 15th, century, majapahit, found, itself, unable, to, control, the, rising, power, of, malacca, which, had, begun, to, gain, effective, control, of, the, strait, of, malacca, and, expand, its, influence, to, sumatra, as, a, major, entrep, t, malacca, attracted, muslim, traders, from, various, part, of, the, world, and, became, a, centre, of, islam, spreading, the, religion, throughout, maritime, southeast, asia, the, expansion, of, islam, into, the, interior, of, java, in, the, 15th, century, led, to, the, gradual, decline, of, majapahit, before, it, finally, succumbed, to, the, emerging, local, muslim, forces, in, the, early, 16th, century, at, the, same, time, the, literary, tradition, of, malacca, developed, the, classical, malay, that, eventually, became, the, lingua, franca, of, the, region, the, advent, of, islam, coupled, with, flourishing, trade, that, used, malay, as, medium, of, communication, culminated, in, the, domination, of, malacca, and, other, succeeding, malay, muslim, sultanates, in, maritime, southeast, asia, as, noted, by, certain, scholars, the, historic, malay, javanese, rivalry, in, the, region, has, persisted, into, modern, times, and, continues, to, shape, the, diplomatic, relations, between, the, malay, centric, malaysia, and, the, java, based, indonesia
