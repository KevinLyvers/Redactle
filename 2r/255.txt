sewell, mentioned, in, the, body, of, the, text, that, the, empire, was, called, karnataka, he, chose, vijayanagar, in, the, title, because, he, knew, kannada, and, telugu, groups, would, fight, if, he, called, it, karnataka, as, per, existing, historical, records, such, as, inscriptions, from, the, historical, ruins, of, the, empire, it, is, referred, to, as, karnataka, samrajya, literally, karnataka, empire, europeans, referred, to, the, vijayanagara, empire, as, the, kingdom, of, narasinga, a, name, derived, from, narasimha, by, the, portuguese, it, is, not, clear, whether, the, name, was, derived, from, saluva, narasimha, deva, raya, or, narasimha, raya, ii, before, the, early, 14th, century, rise, of, the, vijayanagara, empire, the, hindu, states, of, the, deccan, the, yadava,

dimension, to, the, resistance, to, the, muslim, invasion, of, south, india, two, theories, have, been, proposed, regarding, the, linguistic, origins, of, the, vijayanagara, empire, one, is, that, harihara, i, and, bukka, i, the, founders, of, the, empire, were, kannadigas, and, commanders, in, the, army, of, the, hoysala, empire, stationed, in, the, tungabhadra, region, to, ward, off, muslim, invasions, from, northern, india, another, theory, is, that, harihara, and, bukkaraya, were, telugu, people, first, associated, with, the, kakatiya, kingdom, who, took, control, of, the, northern, parts, of, the, hoysala, empire, during, its, decline, they, were, believed, to, have, been, captured, by, the, army, of, ulugh, khan, at, warangal, according, to, tradition, based, on, a, telugu, narrative, the, founders, were, supported, and, inspired, by, vidyaranya, a, saint, at, the, sringeri, monastery, to, fight, the, muslim, invasion, of, south, india, but, the, role, of, vidyaranya, in, the, founding, of, the, vijayanagara, empire, is, not, certain, in, the, first, two, decades, after, the, founding, of, the, empire, harihara, i, gained, control, over, most, of, the, area, south,

the, north, the, original, capital, of, the, empire, was, in, the, principality, of, anegondi, on, the, northern, banks, of, the, tungabhadra, river, in, today, s, karnataka, it, was, moved, to, vijayanagara, during, bukka, raya, i, s, reign, because, it, was, easier, to, defend, against, the, muslim, armies, who, were, persistently, attacking, from, the, northern, lands, with, the, vijayanagara, empire, now, imperial, in, stature, harihara, ii, the, second, son, of, bukka, raya, i, further, consolidated, the, empire, beyond, the, krishna, river, and, south, india, was,
