of, the, order, for, hegemony, a, schism, had, existed, within, the, order, since, the, reformation, had, spread, to, livonia, in, the, 1520s, although, the, transformation, of, the, country, into, a, lutheran, region, was, a, gradual, process, resisted, by, part, of, the, order, that, to, a, varying, degree, remained, sympathetic, to, roman, catholicism, as, war, approached, livonia, had, a, weak, administration, subject, to, internal, rivalries, lacked, any, powerful, defences, or, outside, support, and, was, surrounded, by, monarchies, pursuing, expansionist, policies, robert, i, frost,

archbishop, of, riga, and, christoph, von, mecklenburg, as, his, coadjutor, with, the, help, of, his, brother, albert, albrecht, of, brandenburg, ansbach, the, former, prussian, hochmeister, who, had, secularised, the, southern, teutonic, order, state, and, in, 1525, established, himself, as, duke, in, prussia, wilhelm, and, christoph, were, to, pursue, albert, s, interests, in, livonia, among, which, was, the, establishment, of, a, hereditary, livonian, duchy, styled, after, the, prussian, model, at, the, same, time, the, order, agitated, for, its, re, establishment, rekuperation, in, prussia, opposed, secularization, and, creation, of, a, hereditary, duchy, by, the, time, the, livonian, war, broke, out, the, hanseatic, league, had, already, lost, its, monopoly, on, the, profitable, and, prosperous, baltic, sea, trade, while, still, involved, and, with, increasing, sales, it, now, shared, the, market, with, european, mercenary, fleets, most, notably, from, the, dutch, seventeen, provinces, and, france, the, hanseatic, vessels, were, no, match, for, contemporary, warships, and, since, the, league, was, unable, to, maintain, a, large, navy, because, of, a, declining, share, of, trade, its, livonian, members, riga, reval, tallinn, and, trading, partner, narva, were, left, without, suitable, protection, the, danish, navy, the, most, powerful, in, the, baltic, sea, controlled, the, entrance, to, the, baltic, sea, collected, requisite, tolls, and, held, the, strategically, important, baltic, sea, islands, of, bornholm, and, gotland, a, long, bar, of, danish, territories, in, the, south, and, lack, of, sufficient, year, round, ice, free, ports, severely, limited, sweden, s, access, to, baltic, trade, nevertheless, the, country, prospered, due, to, exports, of, timber, iron, and, most, notably, copper, coupled, with, the, advantages, of, a, growing, navy, and, proximity, to, the, livonian, ports, across, the, narrow, gulf, of, finland, before, the, livonian, war, sweden, had, sought, expansion, into, livonia, but, the, intervention, of, the, russian, tsar, temporarily, stalled, these, efforts, through, the, russo, swedish, war, of, 1554, 1557, which, culminated, in, the, 1557, treaty, of, novgorod, through, its, absorption, of, the, principalities, of, novgorod, 1478, and, pskov, 1510, the, tsardom, of, russia, had, become, livonia, s, eastern, neighbour, and, grown, stronger, after, annexing, the, khanates, of, kazan, 1552, and, astrakhan, 1556, the, conflict, between, russia, and, the, western, powers, was, exacerbated, by, russia, s, isolation, from, sea, trade, the, new, ivangorod, port, built, in, 1550, during, the, reign, of, tsar, ivan, iv, on, the, eastern, shore, of, the, narva, river, was, considered, unsatisfactory, on, account, of, its, shallow, waters, thereafter, the, tsar, demanded, that, the, livonian, confederation, pay, about, 6, 000, marks, to, keep, the, bishopric, of, dorpat, based, on, the, claim, that, every, adult, male, had, paid, pskov, one, mark, when, it, had, been, an, independent, state, the, livonians, eventually, promised, to, pay, this, sum, to, ivan, by, 1557, but, were, sent, from, moscow, when, they, failed, to, do, so, ending, negotiations, ivan, continued, to, point, out, that, the, existence, of, the, order, required, passive, russian, support, and, was, quick, to, threaten, use, of, military, force, if, necessary, he, aimed, to, establish, a, corridor, between, the, baltic, and, the, new, territories, on, the, caspian, sea, because, if, russia, were, to, engage, in, open, conflict, with, major, western, powers, it, would, need, imports, of, more, sophisticated, weaponry, the, polish, king, and, lithuanian, grand, duke, sigismund, ii, augustus, was, wary, of, russian, expansionist, aspirations, expansion, of, russia, into, livonia, would, have, meant, not, only, a, stronger, political, rival, but, also, loss, of, lucrative, trade, routes, therefore, sigismund, supported, his, cousin, wilhelm, von, brandenburg, archbishop, of, riga, in, his, conflicts, with, wilhelm, von, f, rstenberg, the, livonian, order, s, landmeister, sigismund, hoped, that, livonia, just, like, the, duchy, of, prussia, under, duke, albert, would, become, a, vassal, state, of, poland, lithuania, with, weak, support, in, livonia, von, brandenburg, had, to, largely, rely, on, external, allies, among, his, few, livonian, supporters, was, landmarschall, jasper, von, munster, with, whom, he, planned, an, april, 1556, attack, on, his, opponents, that, would, involve, military, aid, from, both, sigismund, and, albert, however, sigismund, hesitated, over, participation, in, the, action, fearing, that, it, would, leave, the, kiev, voivodeship, exposed, to, a, pending, russian, attack, when, von, f, rstenberg, learned, of, the, plan, he, led, a, force, into, the, archbishopric, of, riga, and, in, june, 1556, captured, the, main, strongholds, of, kokenhusen, and, ronneburg, jasper, von, munster, fled, to, lithuania, but, von, brandenburg, and, christoph, von, mecklenburg, were, captured, and, detained, at, adsel, and, treiden, this, resulted, in, a, diplomatic, mission, to, petition, for, their, release, being, dispatched, by, the, pomeranian, dukes, the, danish, king, emperor, ferdinand, i, and, the, estates, of, the, holy, roman, empire, a, cross, party, meeting, in, l, beck, to, resolve, the, conflict, was, scheduled, for, 1, april, 1557, but, was, cancelled, due, to, quarrels, between, sigismund, and, the, danish, envoys, sigismund, used, the, killing, of, his, envoy, lancki, by, the, landmeister, s, son, as, an, excuse, to, invade, the, southern, portion, of, livonia, with, an, army, of, around, 80, 000, he, forced, the, competing, parties, in, livonia, to, reconcile, at, his, camp, in, pozvol, in, september, 1557, there, they, signed, the, treaty, of, pozvol, which, created, a, mutual, defensive, and, offensive, alliance, with, its, primary, target, russia, and, provoked, the, livonian, war, ivan, iv, regarded, the, livonian, confederation, s, approach, to, the, polish, lithuanian, union, for, protection, under, the, treaty, of, pozvol, as, casus, belli, in, 1554, livonia, and, russia, had, signed, a, fifteen, year, truce, in, which, livonia, agreed, not, to, enter, into, an, alliance, with, poland, lithuania, on, 22, january, 1558, ivan, reacted, with, the, invasion, of, livonia, the, russians, were, seen, by, local, peasants, as, liberators, from, the, german, control, of, livonia, many, livonian, fortresses, surrendered, without, resistance, while, russian, troops, took, dorpat, tartu, in, may, narva, in, july, and, laid, siege, to, reval, tallinn, reinforced, by, 1, 200, landsknechts, 100, gunners, and, ammunition, from, germany, livonian, forces, successfully, retook, wesenberg, rakvere, along, with, a, number, of, other, fortresses, although, the, germans, raided, russian, territory, dorpat, tartu, narva, and, many, lesser, fortresses, remained, in, russian, hands, the, initial, russian, advance, was, led, by, the, khan, of, qasim, shahghali, with, two, other, tatar, princes, at, the, head, of, a, force, that, included, russian, boyars, tatar, and, pomestnoe, cavalry, as, well, as, cossacks, who, at, that, time, were, mostly, armed, foot, soldiers, ivan, gained, further, ground, in, campaigns, during, the, years, 1559, and, 1560, in, january, 1559, russian, forces, again, invaded, livonia, a, six, month, truce, covering, may, to, november, was, signed, between, russia, and, livonia, while, russia, fought, in, the, russo, crimean, wars, prompted, by, the, russian, invasion, livonia, first, unsuccessfully, sought, help, from, emperor,

came, under, polish, lithuanian, protection, through, the, first, treaty, of, vilnius, the, polish, sejm, refused, to, agree, to, the, treaty, believing, it, to, be, a, matter, affecting, only, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, in, january, 1560, sigismund, sent, ambassador, martin, volodkov, to, the, court, of, ivan, in, moscow, in, an, attempt, to, stop, the, russian, cavalry, rampaging, through, rural, livonia, russian, successes, followed, similar, patterns, featuring, a, multitude, of, small, campaigns, with, sieges, where, musketmen, played, a, key, role, in, destroying, wooden, defences, with, effective, artillery, support, the, tsar, s, forces, took, important, fortresses, like, fellin, viljandi, yet, lacked, the, means, to, gain, the, major, cities, of, riga, reval, tallinn, or, pernau, p, rnu, the, livonian, knights, suffered, a, disastrous, defeat, by, the, russians, at, the, battle, of, r, eme, in, august, 1560, some, historians, believe, the, russian, nobility, were, split, over, the, timing, of, the, invasion, of, livonia, eric, xiv, the, new, king, of, sweden, turned, down, kettler, s, requests, for, assistance, along, with, a, similar, request, from, poland, kettler, turned, to, sigismund, for, help, the, weakened, livonian, order, was, dissolved, by, the, second, treaty, of, vilnius, in, 1561, its, lands, were, secularised, as, the, duchy, of, livonia, and, duchy, of, courland, and, semigallia, and, assigned, to, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, kettler, became, the, first, duke, of, courland, in, doing, so, converting, to, lutheranism, included, in, the, treaty, was, the, privilegium, sigismundi, augusti, by, which, sigismund, guaranteed, the, livonian, estates, privileges, including, religious, freedom, with, respect, to, the, augsburg, confession, the, indygenat, and, continuation, of, the, traditional, german, administration, the, terms, regarding, religious, freedom, forbade, any, regulation, of, the, protestant, order, by, religious, or, secular, authorities, some, members, of, the, lithuanian, nobility, opposed, the, growing, polish, lithuanian, union, and, offered, the, lithuanian, crown, to, ivan, iv, the, tsar, publicly, advertised, this, option, either, because, he, took, the, offer, seriously, or, because, he, needed, time, to, strengthen, his, livonian, troops, throughout, 1561, a, russo, lithuanian, truce, with, a, scheduled, expiration, date, of, 1562, was, respected, by, both, sides, in, return, for, a, loan, and, a, guarantee, of, danish, protection, bishop, johann, von, m, nchhausen, signed, a, treaty, on, 26, september, 1559, giving, frederick, ii, of, denmark, norway, the, right, to, nominate, the, bishop, of, sel, wiek, an, act, which, amounted, to, the, sale, of, these, territories, for, 30, 000, thalers, frederick, ii, nominated, his, brother, duke, magnus, of, holstein, as, bishop, who, then, took, possession, in, april, 1560, lest, danish, efforts, create, more, insecurity, for, sweden, denmark, norway, made, another, attempt, to, mediate, a, peace, in, the, region, magnus, at, once, pursued, his, own, interests, purchasing, the, bishopric, of, courland, without, frederick, s, consent, and, trying, to, expand, into, harrien, wierland, harju, and, virumaa, this, brought, him, into, direct, conflict, with, eric, in, 1561, swedish, forces, arrived, and, the, noble, corporations, of, harrien, wierland, and, jerwen, j, rva, yielded, to, sweden, to, form, the, duchy, of, estonia, reval, tallinn, similarly, accepted, swedish, rule, denmark, dominated, the, baltic, and, sweden, wished, to, challenge, this, by, gaining, territory, on, the, eastern, side, of, the, baltic, doing, so, would, help, sweden, control, the, west, s, trade, with, russia, this, helped, to, precipitate, the, northern, seven, years, war, since, in, 1561, frederick, ii, had, already, protested, against, swedish, presence, in, reval, tallinn, claiming, historical, rights, relating, to, danish, estonia, when, eric, xiv, s, forces, seized, pernau, p, rnu, in, june, 1562, his, diplomats, tried, to, arrange, swedish, protection, for, riga, which, brought, him, into, conflict, with, sigismund, sigismund, maintained, close, relations, with, eric, xiv, s, brother, john, duke, of, finland, later, john, iii, and, in, october, 1562, john, married, sigismund, s, sister, catherine, thereby, preventing, her, marrying, ivan, iv, while, eric, xiv, had, approved, the, marriage, he, was, upset, when, john, lent, sigismund, 120, 000, dalers, and, received, seven, livonian, castles, as, security, this, incident, led, to, john, s, capture, and, imprisonment, in, august, 1563, on, eric, xiv, s, behalf, whereupon, sigismund, allied, with, denmark, and, l, beck, against, eric, xiv, in, october, the, same, year, the, intervention, of, denmark, norway, sweden, and, poland, lithuania, into, livonia, began, a, period, of, struggle, for, control, of, the, baltic, known, contemporaneously, as, the, dominium, maris, baltici, while, the, initial, war, years, were, characterised, by, intensive, fighting, a, period, of, low, intensity, warfare, began, in, 1562, and, lasted, until, 1570, when, fighting, once, more, intensified, denmark, sweden, and, to, some, extent, poland, lithuania, were, occupied, with, the, nordic, seven, years, war, 1563, 1570, taking, place, in, the, western, baltic, but, livonia, remained, strategically, important, in, 1562, denmark, and, russia, concluded, the, treaty, of, mozhaysk, respecting, each, other, s, claims, in, livonia, and, maintaining, amicable, relations, in, 1564, sweden, and, russia, concluded, a, seven, years, truce, both, ivan, iv, and, eric, xiv, showed, signs, of, mental, disorder, with, ivan, iv, turning, against, part, of, the, tsardom, s, nobility, and, people, with, the, oprichina, that, began, in, 1565, leaving, russia, in, a, state, of, political, chaos, and, civil, war, when, the, russo, lithuanian, truce, expired, in, 1562, ivan, iv, rejected, sigismund, s, offer, of, an, extension, the, tsar, had, used, the, period, of, the, truce, to, build, up, his, forces, in, livonia, and, he, invaded, lithuania, his, army, raided, vitebsk, and, after, a, series, of, border, clashes, took, polotsk, in, 1563, lithuanian, victories, came, at, the, battle, of, ula, in, 1564, and, at, czasniki, chashniki, in, 1567, a, period, of, intermittent, conflict, between, the, two, sides, ivan, continued, to, gain, ground, among, the, towns, and, villages, of, central, livonia, but, was, held, at, the, coast, by, lithuania, the, defeats, of, ula, and, czasniki, along, with, the, defection, of, andrey, kurbsky, led, ivan, iv, to, move, his, capital, to, the, alexandrov, kremlin, while, the, perceived, opposition, against, him, was, repressed, by, his, oprichniki, a, grand, party, of, diplomats, left, lithuania, for, moscow, in, may, 1566, lithuania, was, prepared, to, split, livonia, with, russia, with, a, view, to, a, joint, offensive, to, drive, sweden, from, the, area, however, this, was, seen, as, a, sign, of, weakness, by, russian, diplomats, who, instead, suggested, that, russia, take, the, whole, of, livonia, including, riga, through, the, ceding, of, courland, in, southern, livonia, and, polotsk, on, the, lithuanian, russian, border, the, transfer, of, riga, and, the, surrounding, entrance, to, the, river, dvina, troubled, the, lithuanians, since, much, of, their, trade, depended, on, safe, passage, through, it, and, they, had, already, built, fortifications, to, protect, it, ivan, expanded, his, demands, in, july, calling, for, sel, in, addition, to, dorpat, tartu, and, narva, no, agreement, was, forthcoming, and, a, ten, day, break, was, taken, in, negotiations, during, which, time, various, russian, meetings, were, held, including, the, zemsky, sobor, the, assembly, of, the, land, to, discuss, the, issues, at, stake, within, the, assembly, the, church, s, representative, stressed, the, need, to, keep, riga, though, it, had, not, yet, been, conquered, while, the, boyars, were, less, keen, on, an, overall, peace, with, lithuania, noting, the, danger, posed, by, a, joint, polish, lithuanian, state, talks, were, then, halted, and, hostilities, resumed, upon, the, return, of, the, ambassadors, to, lithuania, in, 1569, the, treaty, of, lublin, unified, poland, and, lithuania, into, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, the, duchy, of, livonia, tied, to, lithuania, in, real, union, since, the, union, of, grodno, in, 1566, came, under, polish, lithuanian, joint, sovereignty, in, june, 1570, a, three, year, truce, was, signed, with, russia, sigismund, ii, the, commonwealth, s, first, king, died, in, 1572, leaving, the, polish, throne, with, no, clear, successor, for, the, first, time, since, 1382, and, thus, began, the, first, free, election, in, polish, history, some, lithuanian, nobles, in, an, effort, to, retain, lithuanian, autonomy, proposed, a, russian, candidate, ivan, however, demanded, the, return, of, kiev, an, orthodox, coronation, and, a, hereditary, monarchy, in, parallel, to, russia, s, with, his, son, feodor, as, king, the, electorate, rejected, these, demands, and, instead, chose, henry, of, valois, henryk, walezy, brother, of, king, charles, ix, of, france, in, 1564, sweden, and, russia, agreed, the, treaty, of, dorpat, whereby, russia, recognised, sweden, s, right, to, reval, tallinn, and, other, castles, and, sweden, accepted, russia, s, patrimony, over, the, rest, of, livonia, a, seven, year, truce, was, signed, between, russia, and, sweden, in, 1565, eric, xiv, of, sweden, was, overthrown, in, 1568, after, he, killed, several, nobles, in, the, sture, murders, sturemorden, of, 1567, and, was, replaced, by, his, half, brother, john, iii, both, russia, and, sweden, had, other, problems, and, were, keen, to, avoid, an, expensive, escalation, of, the, war, in, livonia, ivan, iv, had, requested, the, delivery, of, john, s, wife, the, polish, lithuanian, princess, catherine, jagellonica, to, russia, since, he, had, competed, with, john, to, marry, into, the, lithuanian, polish, royal, family, in, july, 1569, john, sent, a, party, to, russia, led, by, paul, juusten, bishop, of, bo, which, arrived, in, novgorod, in, september, following, the, arrival, in, moscow, of, the, ambassadors, sent, to, sweden, in, 1567, by, ivan, to, retrieve, catherine, ivan, refused, to, meet, with, the, party, himself, forcing, them, to, negotiate, instead, with, the, governor, of, novgorod, the, tsar, requested, that, swedish, envoys, should, greet, the, governor, as, the, brother, of, their, king, but, juusten, refused, to, do, so, the, governor, then, ordered, an, attack, on, the, swedish, party, that, their, clothes, and, money, be, taken, and, that, they, be, deprived, of, food, and, drink, and, be, paraded, naked, through, the, streets, although, the, swedes, were, also, to, be, moved, to, moscow, this, occurred, at, the, same, time, ivan, and, his, oprichniki, were, on, their, way, to, launch, an, assault, on, novgorod, in, northern, russia, in, an, act, of, vengeance, against, the, perceived, treason, of, the, local, orthodox, church, in, novgorod, ivan, s, forces, launched, an, attack, on, the, city, where, 2, 000, 15, 000, people, were, killed, on,

feared, war, with, poland, lithuania, russia, considered, the, delivery, of, catherine, to, be, a, precondition, of, any, deal, and, the, swedes, agreed, to, meet, in, novgorod, to, discuss, the, matter, according, to, juusten, at, the, meeting, the, russians, demanded, the, swedes, to, abandon, their, claim, to, reval, tallinn, provide, two, or, three, hundred, cavalry, when, required, pay, 10, 000, thaler, in, direct, compensation, surrender, finnish, silver, mines, near, the, border, with, russia, and, allow, the, tsar, to, style, himself, lord, of, sweden, the, swedish, party, left,

broke, out, anew, quarrels, between, denmark, norway, and, sweden, led, to, the, northern, seven, years, war, in, 1563, which, ended, in, 1570, with, the, treaty, of, stettin, primarily, fought, in, western, and, southern, scandinavia, the, war, involved, important, naval, battles, fought, in, the, baltic, when, danish, held, varberg, surrendered, to, swedish, forces, in, 1565, 150, danish, mercenaries, escaped, the, subsequent, massacre, of, the, garrison, by, defecting, to, sweden, among, them, was, pontus, de, la, gardie, who, thereafter, became, an, important, swedish, commander, in, the, livonian, war, livonia, was, also, affected, by, the, naval, campaign, of, danish, admiral, peder, munk, who, bombarded, swedish, reval, tallinn, from, sea, in, july, 1569, the, treaty, of, stettin, made, denmark, the, supreme, and, dominating, power, in, northern, europe, yet, failed, to, restore, the, kalmar, union, unfavourable, conditions, for, sweden, led, to, a, series, of, conflicts, that, only, ended, with, the, great, northern, war, in, 1720, sweden, agreed, to, turn, over, her, possessions, in, livonia, in, return, for, a, payment, by, holy, roman, emperor, maximilian, ii, maximilian, failed, to, pay, the, promised, compensation, however, and, thereby, lost, his, influence, on, baltic, affairs, the, terms, of, the, treaty, regarding, livonia, were, ignored, and, thus, the, livonian, war, continued, from, ivan, s, point, of, view, the, treaty, enabled, the, powers, involved, to, form, an, alliance, against, him, now, that, they, were, no, longer, fighting, each, other, during, the, early, 1570s, king, john, iii, of, sweden, faced, a, russian, offensive, on, his, positions, in, estonia, reval, tallinn, withstood, a, russian, siege, in, 1570, and, 1571, but, several, smaller, towns, were, taken, by, russian, forces, on, 23, january, a, swedish, army, of, 700, infantry, and, 600, cavalry, under, command, of, clas, kesson, tott, the, elder, clashed, with, a, russian, and, tartar, army, of, 16, 000, men, under, the, command, of, khan, sain, bulat, at, the, battle, of, lode, by, the, village, of, koluvere, the, russian, advance, concluded, with, the, sacking, of, weissenstein, paide, in, 1573, where, after, its, capture, the, occupying, forces, roasted, some, of, the, leaders, of, the, swedish, garrison, alive, including, the, commander, this, triggered, a, retaliatory, campaign, by, john, centred, on, wesenberg, to, which, the, army, departed, in, november, 1573, with, klas, kesson, tott, in, overall, command, and, pontus, de, la, gardie, as, field, commander, there, were, also, russian, raids, into, finland, including, one, as, far, as, helsingfors, helsinki, in, 1572, a, two, year, truce, on, this, front, was, signed, in, 1575, john, s, counter, offensive, stalled, at, the, siege, of, wesenberg, in, 1574, when, german, and, scottish, units, of, the, swedish, army, turned, against, each, other, this, failure, has, also, been, blamed, on, the, difficulties, of, fighting, in, the, bitter, winter, conditions, particularly, for, the, infantry, the, war, in, livonia, was, a, great, financial, burden, for, sweden, and, by, the, end, of, 1573, sweden, s, german, mercenaries, were, owed, 200, 000, daler, john, gave, them, the, castles, of, hapsal, leal, and, lode, as, security, but, when, he, failed, to, pay, they, were, sold, to, denmark, meanwhile, efforts, by, magnus, to, besiege, swedish, controlled, reval, tallinn, were, faltering, with, support, from, neither, ivan, nor, magnus, brother, frederick, ii, of, denmark, forthcoming, ivan, s, attention, was, focused, elsewhere, while, frederick, s, reluctance, perhaps, stemmed, from, a, new, spirit, of, swedish, danish, unity, that, made, him, unwilling, to, invade, livonia, on, behalf, of, magnus, whose, state, was, a, vassal, of, russia, the, siege, was, abandoned, in, march, 1571, whereupon, swedish, action, in, the, baltic, escalated, with, the, passive, backing, of, sigismund, john, s, brother, in, law, at, the, same, time, crimean, tatars, devastated, russian, territories, and, burned, and, looted, moscow, during, the, russo, crimean, wars, drought, and, epidemics, had, fatally, affected, the, russian, economy, while, oprichnina, had, thoroughly, disrupted, the, government, following, the, defeat, of, crimean, and, nogai, forces, in, 1572, oprichnina, was, wound, down, and, with, it, the, way, russian, armies, were, formed, also, changed, ivan, iv, had, introduced, a, new, strategy, whereby, he, relied, on, tens, of, thousands, of, native, troops, cossacks, and, tatars, instead, of, a, few, thousand, skilled, troops, and, mercenaries, as, was, the, practice, of, his, adversaries, ivan, s, campaign, reached, its, height, in, 1576, when, another, 30, 000, russian, soldiers, crossed, into, livonia, in, 1577, and, devastated, danish, areas, in, retaliation, for, the, danish, acquisition, of, hapsal, leal, and, lode, danish, influence, in, livonia, ceased, as, frederick, accepted, deals, with, sweden, and, poland, to, end, nominal, danish, involvement, swedish, forces, were, besieged, in, reval, tallinn, and, central, livonia, raided, as, far, as, d, naburg, daugavpils, formally, under, polish, lithuanian, control, since, the, 1561, treaty, of, vilnius, the, conquered, territories, submitted, to, ivan, or, his, vassal, magnus, declared, monarch, of, the, kingdom, of, livonia, in, 1570, magnus, defected, from, ivan, iv, during, the, same, year, having, started, to, appropriate, castles, without, consulting, the, tsar, when, kokenhusen, koknese, submitted, to, magnus, to, avoid, fighting, ivan, iv, s, army, the, tsar, sacked, the, town, and, executed, its, german, commanders, the, campaign, then, focussed, on, wenden, c, sis, v, nnu, the, heart, of, livonia, which, as, the, former, capital, of, the, livonian, order, was, not, only, of, strategic, importance, but, also, symbolic, of, livonia, itself, in, 1576, the, transylvanian, prince, stephen, b, thory, became, king, of, poland, and, grand, duke, of, lithuania, after, a, contested, election, to, the, joint, polish, lithuanian, throne, with, the, habsburg, emperor, maximilian, ii, both, b, thory, s, fianc, e, anna, jagiellon, and, maximilian, ii, had, been, proclaimed, elected, to, the, same, throne, in, december, 1575, three, days, apart, maximilan, s, death, in, october, 1576, prevented, the, conflict, from, escalating, b, thory, ambitious, to, expel, ivan, iv, from, livonia, was, constrained, by, the, opposition, of, danzig, gdansk, which, resisted, b, thory, s, accession, with, danish, support, the, ensuing, danzig, war, of, 1577, ended, when, b, thory, conceded, further, autonomous, rights, to, the, city, in, return, for, a, payment, of, 200, 000, zlotys, for, a, further, 200, 000, zloty, payment, he, appointed, hohenzollern, george, frederick, as, administrator, of, prussia, and, secured, the, latter, s, military, support, in, the, planned, campaign, against, russia, b, thory, received, only, few, soldiers, from, his, polish, vassals, and, was, forced, to, recruit, mercenaries, primarily, poles, hungarians, bohemians, germans, and, wallachians, a, separate, szekler, brigade, fought, in, livonia, swedish, king, john, iii, and, stephen, b, thory, allied, against, ivan, iv, in, december, 1577, despite, problems, caused, by, the, death, of, sigismund, which, meant, that, the, issue, of, the, substantial, inheritance, due, to, john, s, wife, catherine, had, not, been, resolved, poland, also, claimed, the, whole, of, livonia, without, accepting, swedish, rule, of, any, part, of, it, the, 120, 000, daler, lent, in, 1562, had, still, not, been, repaid, despite, sigismund, s, best, intentions, to, settle, it, by, november, lithuanian, forces, moving, northward, had, captured, d, naburg, while, a, polish, swedish, force, took, the, town, and, castle, of, wenden, in, early, 1578, russian, forces, failed, to, retake, the, town, in, february, an, attack, followed, by, a, swedish, offensive, targeting, pernau, p, rnu, dorpat, and, novgorod, among, others, in, september, ivan, responded, by, sending, in, an, army, of, 18, 000, men, who, recaptured, oberpahlen, p, ltsamaa, from, sweden, and, then, marched, on, wenden, upon, their, arrival, at, wenden, the, russian, army, laid, siege, to, the, town, but, was, met, by, a, relief, force, of, around, 6, 000, german, polish, and, swedish, soldiers, in, the, ensuing, battle, of, wenden, russian, casualties, were, severe, with, armaments, and, horses, captured, leaving, ivan, iv, with, his, first, serious, defeat, in, livonia, b, thory, accelerated, the, formation, of, the, hussars, a, new, well, organised, cavalry, troop, that, replaced, the, feudal, levy, similarly, he, improved, an, already, effective, artillery, system, and, recruited, cossacks, b, thory, gathered, 56, 000, troops, 30, 000, of, them, from, lithuania, for, his, first, assault, on, russia, at, polotsk, as, part, of, a, wider, campaign, with, ivan, s, reserves, in, pskov, and, novgorod, to, guard, against, a, possible, swedish, invasion, the, city, fell, on, 30, august, 1579, b, thory, then, appointed, a, close, ally, and, powerful, member, of, his, court, jan, zamoyski, to, lead, a, force, of, 48, 000, including, 25, 000, men, from, lithuania, against, the, fortress, of, velikie, luki, which, he, went, on, to, capture, on, 5, september, 1580, without, further, significant, resistance, garrisons, such, as, sokol, velizh, and, usvzat, fell, quickly, in, 1581, the, force, besieged, pskov, a, well, fortified, and, heavily, defended, fortress, however, financial, support, from, the, polish, parliament, was, dropping, and, b, thory, failed, to, lure, russian, forces, in, livonia, out, into, open, field, before, the, onset, of, winter, not, realising, that, the, polish, lithuanian, advance, was, on, the, wane, ivan, signed, the, truce, of, jam, zapolski, the, failure, of, the, swedish, siege, of, narva, in, 1579, led, to, pontus, de, la, gardie, s, appointment, as, commander, in, chief, the, towns, of, kexholm, and, padise, were, taken, by, swedish, forces, in, 1580, then, in, 1581, concurrent, with, the, fall, of, wesenberg, a, mercenary, army, hired, by, sweden, recaptured, the, strategic, city, of, narva, a, target, of, john, iii, s, campaigns, since, it, could, be, attacked, by, both, land, and, sea, the, campaign, made, use, of, sweden, s, considerable, fleet, but, later, arguments, over, formal, control, in, the, long, term, hampered, any, alliance, with, poland, following, la, gardie, s, taking, of, the, city, and, in, retaliation, for, previous, russian, massacres, 7, 000, russians, were, killed, according, to, russow, s, contemporary, chronicle, the, fall, of, narva, was, followed, by, those, of, ivangorod, jama, and, koporye, leaving, sweden, content, with, its, gains, in, livonia, subsequent, negotiations, led, by, jesuit, papal, legate, antonio, possevino, resulted, in, the, 1582, truce, of, jam, zapolski, between, russia, and, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, this, was, a, humiliation, for, the, tsar, in, part, because, he, requested, the, truce, under, the, agreement, russia, would, surrender, all, areas, in, livonia, it, still, held, and, the, city, of, dorpat, tartu, to, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, while, polotsk, would, remain, under, commonwealth, control, any, captured, swedish, territory, specifically, narva, could, be, retained, by, the, russians, and, velike, luki, would, be, returned, from, b, thory, s, control, to, russia, possevino, made, a, half, hearted, attempt, to, get, john, iii, s, wishes, taken, into, consideration, but, this, was, vetoed, by, the, tsar, probably, in, collusion, with, b, thory, the, armistice, which, fell, short, of, a, full, peace, arrangement, was, to, last, ten, years, and, was, renewed, twice, in, 1591, and, 1601, b, thory, failed, in, his, attempts, to, pressure, sweden, into, relinquishing, its, gains, in, livonia, particularly, narva, following, a, decision, by, john, the, war, with, russia, ended, when, the, tsar, concluded, the, truce, of, plussa, plyussa, pljussa, plusa, with, sweden, on, 10, august, 1583, russia, relinquished, most, of, ingria, leaving, narva, and, ivangorod, as, well, under, swedish, control, originally, scheduled, to, last, three, years, the, russo, swedish, truce, was, later, extended, until, 1590, during, the, negotiations, sweden, made, vast, demands, for, russian, territory, including, novgorod, whilst, these, conditions, were, probably, only, for, the, purposes, of, negotiation, they, may, have, reflected, swedish, aspirations, of, territory, in, the, region, the, post, war, duchy, of, courland, and, semigallia, south, of, the, d, na, daugava, river, experienced, a, period, of, political, stability, based, on, the, 1561, treaty, of, vilnius, later, modified, by, the, 1617, formula, regiminis, and, statuta, curlandi, which, granted, indigenous, nobles, additional, rights, at, the, duke, s, expense, north, of, the, d, na, b, thory, reduced, the, privileges, sigismund, had, granted, the, duchy, of, livonia, regarding, the, regained, territories, as, the, spoils, of, war, riga, s, privileges, had, already, been, reduced, by, the, treaty, of, drohiczyn, in, 1581, polish, gradually, replaced, german, as, the, administrative, language, and, the, establishment, of, voivodeships, reduced, the, baltic, german, administration, the, local, clergy, and, the, jesuits, in, livonia, embraced, the, counter, reformation, in, a, process, assisted, by, b, thory, who, gave, the, roman, catholic, church, revenues, and, estates, confiscated, from, protestants, as, well, as, initiating, a, largely, unsuccessful, recruitment, campaign, for, catholic, colonists, despite, these, measures, the, livonian, population, did, not, convert, en, masse, while, the, livonian, estates, in, poland, lithuania, were, alienated, in, 1590, the, russo, swedish, truce, of, plussa, expired, and, fighting, resumed, while, the, ensuing, russo, swedish, war, of, 1590, 5, ended, with, the, treaty, of, teusina, tyavzino, tyavzin, under, which, sweden, had, to, cede, ingria, and, kexholm, to, russia, the, swedish, polish, alliance, began, to, crumble, when, the, polish, king, and, grand, duke, of, lithuania, sigismund, iii, who, as, son, of, john, iii, of, sweden, died, 1592, and, catherine, jagellonica, was, the, successor, to, the, swedish, throne, met, with, resistance, from, a, faction, led, by, his, uncle, charles, of, s, dermanland, later, charles, ix, who, claimed, regency, in, sweden, for, himself, sweden, descended, into, a, civil, war, in, 1597, followed, by, the, 1598, 1599, war, against, sigismund, which, ended, with, the, deposition, of, sigismund, by, the, swedish, riksdag, local, nobles, turned, to, charles, for, protection, in, 1600, when, the, conflict, spread, to, livonia, where, sigismund, had, tried, to, incorporate, swedish, estonia, into, the, duchy, of, livonia, charles, then, expelled, the, polish, forces, from, estonia, and, invaded, the, livonian, duchy, starting, a, series, of, polish, swedish, wars, at, the, same, time, russia, was, embroiled, in, civil, war, over, the, vacant, russian, throne, time, of, troubles, when, none, of, the, many, claimants, had, prevailed, this, conflict, became, intertwined, with, the, livonian, campaigns, when, swedish, and, polish, lithuanian, forces, intervened, on, opposite, sides, the, latter, starting, the, polish, muscovite, war, charles, ix, s, forces, were, expelled, from, livonia, after, major, setbacks, at, the, battles, of, kokenhausen, 1601, and, kircholm, 1605, during, the, later, ingrian, war, charles, successor, gustavus, adolphus, retook, ingria, and, kexholm, which, were, formally, ceded, to, sweden, under, the, 1617, treaty, of, stolbovo, along, with, the, bulk, of, the, duchy, of, livonia, in, 1617, when, sweden, had, recovered, from, the, kalmar, war, with, denmark, several, livonian, towns, were, captured, but, only, pernau, p, rnu, remained, under, swedish, control, after, a, polish, lithuanian, counter, offensive, a, second, campaign, then, started, with, the, capture, of, riga, in, 1621, and, expelled, polish, lithuanian, forces, from, most, of, livonia, where, the, dominion, of, swedish, livonia, was, created, swedish, forces, then, advanced, through, royal, prussia, and, poland, lithuania, accepted, swedish, gains, in, livonia, in, the, 1629, treaty, of, altmark, the, danish, province, of, sel, was, ceded, to, sweden, under, the, 1645, treaty, of, br, msebro, which, ended, the, torstenson, war, one, theatre, of, the, thirty, years, war, it, was, retained, after, the, peace, of, oliva, and, the, treaty, of, copenhagen, both, in, 1660, the, situation, remained, unchanged, until, 1710, when, estonia, and, livonia, capitulated, to, russia, during, the, great, northern, war, an, action, formalised, in, the, treaty, of, nystad,
