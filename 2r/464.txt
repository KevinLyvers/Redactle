naval, base, at, pearl, harbor, in, honolulu, hawaii, in, the, united, states, just, before, 8, 00, a, m, local, time, on, sunday, december, 7, 1941, at, the, time, the, united, states, was, a, neutral, country, in, world, war, ii, the, attack, on, hawaii, and, other, u, s, territories, led, the, united, states, to, formally, enter, world, war, ii, on, the, side, of, the, allies, the, day, following, the, attack, on, december, 8, 1941, the, japanese, military, leadership, referred, to, the, attack, as, the, hawaii, operation, and, operation, ai, and, as, operation, z, during, its, planning, the, empire, of, japan, s, attack, on, pearl, harbor, was, preceded, by, months, of, negotiations, between, the, united, states, and, japan, over, the, future, of, the, pacific, japanese, demands, included, that, the, united, states, end, its, sanctions, against, japan, cease, aiding, china, in, the, second, sino, japanese, war, and, allow, japan, to, access, the, resources, of, the, dutch, east, indies, anticipating, a, negative, response, japan, sent, out, its, naval, attack, groups, in, november, 1941, just, prior, to, receiving, the, hull, note, which, states, the, united, states, desire, that, japan, withdraw, from, china, and, french, indochina, japan, intended, the, attack, as, a, preventive, action, its, aim, was, to, prevent, the, united, states, pacific, fleet, from, interfering, with, its, planned, military, actions, in, southeast, asia, against, overseas, territories, of, the, united, kingdom, the, netherlands, and, the, united, states, over, the, course, of, seven, hours, japan, conducted, coordinated, attacks, on, the, u, s, held, philippines, guam, and, wake, island, and, on, the, british, empire, in, malaya, singapore, and, hong, kong, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, started, at, 7, 48, a, m, hawaiian, time, 6, 18, p, m, gmt, the, base, was, attacked, by, 353, imperial, japanese, aircraft, including, fighters, level, and, dive, bombers, and, torpedo, bombers, in, two, waves, launched, from, six, aircraft, carriers, of, the, eight, united, states, navy, battleships, present, all, were, damaged, and, four, were, sunk, all, but, uss, arizona, were, later, raised, and, six, were, returned, to, service, and, went, on, to, fight, in, the, war, the, japanese, also, sank, or, damaged, three, cruisers, three, destroyers, an, anti, aircraft, training, ship, and, one, minelayer, more, than, 180, us, aircraft, were, destroyed, a, total, of, 2, 393, americans, were, killed, and, 1, 178, others, were, wounded, making, it, the, deadliest, event, ever, recorded, in, hawaii, important, base, installations, such, as, the, power, station, dry, dock, shipyard, maintenance, and, fuel, and, torpedo, storage, facilities, as, well, as, the, submarine, piers, and, headquarters, building, also, home, of, the, intelligence, section, were, not, attacked, japanese, losses, were, light, 29, aircraft, and, five, midget, submarines, were, lost, and, 129, servicemen, killed, kazuo, sakamaki, the, commanding, officer, of, one, of, the, submarines, was, captured, japan, declared, war, on, the, united, states, and, the, british, empire, later, that, day, december, 8, in, tokyo, but, the, declarations, were, not, delivered, until, the, following, day, the, british, government, declared, war, on, japan, immediately, after, learning, that, their, territory, had, also, been, attacked, while, the, following, day, december, 8, the, united, states, congress, declared, war, on, japan, on, december, 11, though, they, had, no, formal, obligation, to, do, so, under, the, tripartite, pact, with, japan, germany, and, italy, each, declared, war, on, the, united, states, which, responded, with, a, declaration, of, war, against, germany, and, italy, while, there, were, historical, precedents, for, the, unannounced, military, action, by, japan, the, lack, of, any, formal, warning, as, required, by, the, hague, convention, of, 1907, and, the, perception, that, the, attack, had, been, unprovoked, led, then, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, in, the, opening, line, of, his, speech, to, a, joint, session, of, congress, the, following, day, to, famously, label, december, 7, 1941, a, date, which, will, live, in, infamy, war, between, the, empire, of, japan, and, the, united, states, was, seen, as, a, possibility, since, the, 1920s, japan, had, been, wary, of, american, territorial, and, military, expansion, in, the, pacific, and, asia, since, the, late, 1890s, followed, by, the, annexation, of, islands, such, as, hawaii, and, the, philippines, which, they, felt, were, close, to, or, within, their, sphere, of, influence, at, the, same, time, japanese, strategic, thinkers, believed, that, japan, needed, economic, self, sufficiency, in, order, to, wage, modern, war, the, experiences, of, world, war, i, had, taught, the, japanese, that, modern, wars, would, be, protracted, require, total, mobilization, and, create, vulnerabilities, for, trade, embargoes, and, encirclement, as, a, consequence, japan, needed, access, to, strategically, important, resources, e, g, iron, oil, that, could, not, be, extracted, at, sufficient, levels, in, the, home, islands, although, japan, had, begun, to, take, a, hostile, stance, against, the, united, states, after, the, rejection, of, the, racial, equality, proposal, the, relationship, between, the, two, countries, was, cordial, enough, that, they, remained, trading, partners, tensions, did, not, seriously, grow, until, japan, s, invasion, of, manchuria, in, 1931, over, the, next, decade, japan, expanded, into, china, leading, to, the, second, sino, japanese, war, in, 1937, japan, spent, considerable, effort, trying, to, isolate, china, and, endeavored, to, secure, enough, independent, resources, to, attain, victory, on, the, mainland, the, southern, operation, was, designed, to, assist, these, efforts, starting, in, december, 1937, events, such, as, the, japanese, attack, on, uss, panay, the, allison, incident, and, the, nanking, massacre, swung, western, public, opinion, sharply, against, japan, the, united, states, unsuccessfully, proposed, a, joint, action, with, the, united, kingdom, to, blockade, japan, in, 1938, following, an, appeal, by, president, roosevelt, american, companies, stopped, providing, japan, with, implements, of, war, in, 1940, japan, invaded, french, indochina, attempting, to, stymie, the, flow, of, supplies, reaching, china, the, united, states, halted, shipments, of, airplanes, parts, machine, tools, and, aviation, gasoline, to, japan, which, the, latter, perceived, as, an, unfriendly, act, the, united, states, did, not, stop, oil, exports, however, partly, because, of, the, prevailing, sentiment, in, washington, that, given, japanese, dependence, on, american, oil, such, an, action, was, likely, to, be, considered, an, extreme, provocation, in, mid, 1940, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, moved, the, pacific, fleet, from, san, diego, to, hawaii, he, also, ordered, a, military, buildup, in, the, philippines, taking, both, actions, in, the, hope, of, discouraging, japanese, aggression, in, the, far, east, because, the, japanese, high, command, was, mistakenly, certain, any, attack, on, the, united, kingdom, s, southeast, asian, colonies, including, singapore, would, bring, the, united, states, into, the, war, a, devastating, preventive, strike, appeared, to, be, the, only, way, to, prevent, american, naval, interference, an, invasion, of, the, philippines, was, also, considered, necessary, by, japanese, war, planners, the, american, war, plan, orange, had, envisioned, defending, the, philippines, with, an, elite, force, of, 40, 000, men, this, option, was, never, implemented, due, to, opposition, from, douglas, macarthur, who, felt, he, would, need, a, force, ten, times, that, size, by, 1941, american, planners, expected, to, have, to, abandon, the, philippines, at, the, outbreak, of, war, late, that, year, admiral, thomas, c, hart, commander, of, the, united, states, asiatic, fleet, was, given, orders, to, that, effect, the, united, states, finally, ceased, oil, exports, to, japan, in, july, 1941, following, the, seizure, of, french, indochina, after, the, fall, of, france, in, part, because, of, new, american, restrictions, on, domestic, oil, consumption, because, of, this, decision, japan, proceeded, with, plans, to, take, the, oil, rich, dutch, east, indies, on, august, 17, roosevelt, warned, japan, that, america, was, prepared, to, take, opposing, steps, if, neighboring, countries, were, attacked, japan, and, the, united, states, engaged, in, negotiations, during, 1941, attempting, to, improve, relations, in, the, course, of, these, negotiations, japan, offered, to, withdraw, from, most, of, china, and, indochina, after, making, peace, with, the, nationalist, government, it, also, proposed, to, adopt, an, independent, interpretation, of, the, tripartite, pact, and, to, refrain, from, trade, discrimination, provided, all, other, nations, reciprocated, washington, rejected, these, proposals, japanese, prime, minister, konoe, then, offered, to, meet, with, roosevelt, but, roosevelt, insisted, on, reaching, an, agreement, before, any, meeting, the, american, ambassador, to, japan, repeatedly, urged, roosevelt, to, accept, the, meeting, warning, that, it, was, the, only, way, to, preserve, the, conciliatory, konoe, government, and, peace, in, the, pacific, however, his, recommendation, was, not, acted, upon, the, konoe, government, collapsed, the, following, month, when, the, japanese, military, rejected, a, withdrawal, of, all, troops, from, china, japan, s, final, proposal, delivered, on, november, 20, offered, to, withdraw, from, southern, indochina, and, to, refrain, from, attacks, in, southeast, asia, so, long, as, the, united, states, united, kingdom, and, netherlands, supplied, one, million, u, s, gallons, 3, 8, million, liters, of, aviation, fuel, lifted, their, sanctions, against, japan, and, ceased, aid, to, china, the, american, counter, proposal, of, november, 26, november, 27, in, japan, the, hull, note, required, japan, to, completely, evacuate, china, without, conditions, and, conclude, non, aggression, pacts, with, pacific, powers, on, november, 26, in, japan, the, day, before, the, note, s, delivery, the, japanese, task, force, left, port, for, pearl, harbor, the, japanese, intended, the, attack, as, a, preventive, action, to, keep, the, united, states, pacific, fleet, from, interfering, with, their, planned, military, actions, in, southeast, asia, against, overseas, territories, of, the, united, kingdom, the, netherlands, and, the, united, states, over, the, course, of, seven, hours, there, were, coordinated, japanese, attacks, on, the, american, held, philippines, guam, and, wake, island, and, on, the, british, empire, in, malaya, singapore, and, hong, kong, from, the, japanese, point, of, view, it, was, seen, as, a, preemptive, strike, before, the, oil, gauge, ran, empty, preliminary, planning, for, an, attack, on, pearl, harbor, to, protect, the, move, into, the, southern, resource, area, the, japanese, term, for, the, dutch, east, indies, and, southeast, asia, generally, began, early, in, 1941, under, the, auspices, of, admiral, isoroku, yamamoto, then, commanding, japan, s, combined, fleet, he, won, assent, to, formal, planning, and, training, for, an, attack, from, the, imperial, japanese, navy, general, staff, only, after, much, contention, with, naval, headquarters, including, a, threat, to, resign, his, command, full, scale, planning, was, underway, by, early, spring, 1941, primarily, by, rear, admiral, ry, nosuke, kusaka, with, assistance, from, commander, minoru, genda, and, yamamoto, s, deputy, chief, of, staff, captain, kameto, kuroshima, the, planners, studied, the, 1940, british, air, attack, on, the, italian, fleet, at, taranto, intensively, over, the, next, several, months, pilots, were, trained, equipment, was, adapted, and, intelligence, was, collected, despite, these, preparations, emperor, hirohito, did, not, approve, the, attack, plan, until, november, 5, after, the, third, of, four, imperial, conferences, called, to, consider, the, matter, at, first, he, hesitated, to, engage, in, war, but, eventually, authorized, the, pearl, harbor, strike, despite, dissent, from, certain, advisors, final, authorization, was, not, given, by, the, emperor, until, december, 1, after, a, majority, of, japanese, leaders, advised, him, the, hull, note, would, destroy, the, fruits, of, the, china, incident, endanger, manchukuo, and, undermine, japanese, control, of, korea, before, the, attack, he, became, more, involved, in, military, matters, even, joining, the, conference, of, military, councillors, which, was, considered, unusual, for, him, additionally, he, actively, sought, more, information, about, the, war, plans, according, to, an, aide, he, openly, displayed, happiness, upon, hearing, about, the, success, of, the, surprise, attacks, by, late, 1941, many, observers, believed, that, hostilities, between, the, united, states, and, japan, were, imminent, a, gallup, poll, just, before, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, found, that, 52, of, americans, expected, war, with, japan, 27, did, not, and, 21, had, no, opinion, while, american, pacific, bases, and, facilities, had, been, placed, on, alert, on, many, occasions, officials, doubted, pearl, harbor, would, be, the, first, target, instead, they, expected, the, philippines, to, be, attacked, first, this, presumption, was, due, to, the, threat, that, the, air, bases, throughout, the, country, and, the, naval, base, at, manila, posed, to, sea, lanes, as, well, as, to, the, shipment, of, supplies, to, japan, from, territory, to, the, south, they, also, incorrectly, believed, that, japan, was, not, capable, of, mounting, more, than, one, major, naval, operation, at, a, time, the, japanese, attack, had, several, major, aims, first, it, intended, to, destroy, important, american, fleet, units, thereby, preventing, the, pacific, fleet, from, interfering, with, the, japanese, conquest, of, the, dutch, east, indies, and, malaya, and, enabling, japan, to, conquer, southeast, asia, without, interference, the, leaders, of, the, imperial, japanese, navy, ijn, ascribed, to, alfred, thayer, mahan, s, decisive, battle, doctrine, especially, that, of, destroying, the, maximum, number, of, battleships, second, it, was, hoped, to, buy, time, for, japan, to, consolidate, its, position, and, increase, its, naval, strength, before, shipbuilding, authorized, by, the, 1940, vinson, walsh, act, erased, any, chance, of, victory, third, to, deliver, a, blow, to, america, s, ability, to, mobilize, its, forces, in, the, pacific, battleships, were, chosen, as, the, main, targets, since, they, were, the, prestige, ships, of, navies, at, the, time, finally, it, was, hoped, that, the, attack, would, undermine, american, morale, to, such, an, extent, that, the, american, government, would, drop, its, demands, contrary, to, japanese, interests, and, seek, a, peace, compromise, striking, the, pacific, fleet, at, anchor, in, pearl, harbor, had, two, distinct, disadvantages, the, targeted, ships, would, be, in, very, shallow, water, so, it, would, be, relatively, easy, to, salvage, and, possibly, repair, them, and, most, of, the, crews, would, survive, the, attack, since, many, would, be, on, shore, leave, or, would, be, rescued, from, the, harbor, a, further, important, disadvantage, was, the, absence, of, all, three, of, the, pacific, fleet, s, aircraft, carriers, enterprise, lexington, and, saratoga, despite, these, concerns, yamamoto, decided, to, press, ahead, japanese, confidence, in, their, ability, to, win, a, short, war, meant, that, other, targets, in, the, harbor, especially, the, navy, yard, oil, tank, farms, and, submarine, base, were, left, unscathed, since, by, their, thinking, the, war, would, be, over, before, the, influence, of, these, facilities, would, be, felt, on, november, 26, 1941, a, japanese, task, force, the, striking, force, of, six, aircraft, carriers, akagi, kaga, s, ry, hiry, sh, kaku, and, zuikaku, departed, hittokapu, bay, on, etorofu, now, iterup, island, in, the, kuril, islands, en, route, to, a, position, northwest, of, hawaii, intending, to, launch, its, 408, aircraft, to, attack, pearl, harbor, 360, for, the, two, attack, waves, and, 48, on, defensive, combat, air, patrol, cap, including, nine, fighters, from, the, first, wave, the, first, wave, was, to, be, the, primary, attack, while, the, second, wave, was, to, attack, carriers, as, its, first, objective, and, cruisers, as, its, second, with, battleships, as, the, third, target, the, first, wave, carried, most, of, the, weapons, designed, to, attack, capital, ships, mainly, specially, adapted, type, 91, aerial, torpedoes, which, were, designed, with, an, anti, roll, mechanism, and, a, rudder, extension, that, let, them, operate, in, shallow, water, the, aircrews, were, ordered, to, select, the, highest, value, targets, battleships, and, aircraft, carriers, or, if, these, were, not, present, any, other, high, value, ships, cruisers, and, destroyers, first, wave, dive, bombers, were, to, attack, ground, targets, fighters, were, ordered, to, strafe, and, destroy, as, many, parked, aircraft, as, possible, to, ensure, they, did, not, intercept, the, bombers, especially, in, the, first, wave, when, the, fighters, fuel, got, low, they, were, to, refuel, aboard, the, aircraft, carriers, and, return, to, combat, fighters, were, to, assume, cap, duties, where, needed, especially, over, american, airfields, before, the, attack, commenced, the, imperial, japanese, navy, launched, reconnaissance, floatplanes, from, heavy, cruisers, chikuma, and, tone, to, scout, oahu, and, lahaina, roads, maui, respectively, with, orders, to, report, on, american, fleet, composition, and, location, reconnaissance, aircraft, flights, risked, alerting, the, americans, and, were, not, necessary, fleet, composition, and, preparedness, information, in, pearl, harbor, were, already, known, from, the, reports, of, the, japanese, spy, takeo, yoshikawa, a, report, of, the, absence, of, the, american, fleet, at, lahaina, anchorage, off, maui, was, received, from, the, tone, s, floatplane, and, the, fleet, submarine, i, 72, another, four, scout, planes, patrolled, the, area, between, the, japanese, carrier, force, the, kid, butai, and, niihau, to, detect, any, counterattack, fleet, submarines, i, 16, i, 18, i, 20, i, 22, and, i, 24, each, embarked, a, type, a, midget, submarine, for, transport, to, the, waters, off, oahu, the, five, i, boats, left, kure, naval, district, on, november, 25, 1941, on, december, 6, they, came, to, within, 10, nmi, 19, km, 12, mi, of, the, mouth, of, pearl, harbor, and, launched, their, midget, subs, at, about, 01, 00, local, time, on, december, 7, at, 03, 42, hawaiian, time, the, minesweeper, condor, spotted, a, midget, submarine, periscope, southwest, of, the, pearl, harbor, entrance, buoy, and, alerted, the, destroyer, ward, the, midget, may, have, entered, pearl, harbor, however, ward, sank, another, midget, submarine, at, 06, 37, in, the, first, american, shots, in, the, pacific, theater, a, midget, submarine, on, the, north, side, of, ford, island, missed, the, seaplane, tender, curtiss, with, her, first, torpedo, and, missed, the, attacking, destroyer, monaghan, with, her, other, one, before, being, sunk, by, monaghan, at, 08, 43, a, third, midget, submarine, ha, 19, grounded, twice, once, outside, the, harbor, entrance, and, again, on, the, east, side, of, oahu, where, it, was, captured, on, december, 8, ensign, kazuo, sakamaki, swam, ashore, and, was, captured, by, hawaii, national, guard, corporal, david, akui, becoming, the, first, japanese, prisoner, of, war, a, fourth, had, been, damaged, by, a, depth, charge, attack, and, was, abandoned, by, its, crew, before, it, could, fire, its, torpedoes, it, was, found, outside, the, harbor, in, 1960, japanese, forces, received, a, radio, message, from, a, midget, submarine, at, 00, 41, on, december, 8, claiming, to, have, damaged, one, or, more, large, warships, inside, pearl, harbor, in, 1992, 2000, and, 2001, hawaii, undersea, research, laboratory, s, submersibles, found, the, wreck, of, the, fifth, midget, submarine, lying, in, three, parts, outside, pearl, harbor, the, wreck, was, in, the, debris, field, where, much, surplus, american, equipment, had, been, dumped, after, the, war, including, vehicles, and, landing, craft, both, of, its, torpedoes, were, missing, this, correlates, with, reports, of, two, torpedoes, fired, at, the, light, cruiser, st, louis, at, 10, 04, at, the, entrance, of, pearl, harbor, and, a, possible, torpedo, fired, at, destroyer, helm, at, 08, 21, there, is, dispute, over, this, official, chain, of, events, though, the, torpedo, that, st, louis, saw, was, also, reportedly, a, porpoising, minesweeping, float, being, towed, by, the, destroyer, boggs, some, historians, and, naval, architects, theorise, that, a, photo, taken, by, a, japanese, naval, aviator, of, battleship, row, during, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, that, was, declassified, in, the, 1990s, and, publicized, in, the, 2000s, to, the, public, shows, the, fifth, midget, submarine, firing, a, torpedo, at, west, virginia, and, another, at, oklahoma, these, torpedoes, were, twice, the, size, of, the, aerial, torpedoes, so, it, was, possible, that, both, torpedoes, heavily, contributed, to, the, sinkings, of, both, ships, and, especially, helped, to, capsize, oklahoma, as, oklahoma, was, the, only, battleship, that, day, to, suffer, catastrophic, damage, to, her, belt, armor, at, the, waterline, from, a, torpedo, admiral, chester, nimitz, in, a, report, to, congress, confirmed, that, one, midget, submarine, s, torpedo, possibly, from, the, other, midget, submarine, that, fired, torpedoes, but, failed, to, hit, a, target, which, was, fired, but, did, not, explode, was, recovered, in, pearl, harbor, and, was, much, larger, than, the, aerial, torpedoes, others, dispute, this, theory, the, attack, took, place, before, any, formal, declaration, of, war, was, made, by, japan, but, this, was, not, admiral, yamamoto, s, intention, he, originally, stipulated, that, the, attack, should, not, commence, until, thirty, minutes, after, japan, had, informed, the, united, states, that, peace, negotiations, were, at, an, end, however, the, attack, began, before, the, notice, could, be, delivered, tokyo, transmitted, the, 5000, word, notification, commonly, called, the, 14, part, message, in, two, blocks, to, the, japanese, embassy, in, washington, transcribing, the, message, took, too, long, for, the, japanese, ambassador, to, deliver, it, at, 1, 00, p, m, washington, time, as, ordered, and, consequently, the, message, was, not, presented, until, more, than, one, hour, after, the, attack, had, begun, but, in, fact, american, code, breakers, had, already, deciphered, and, translated, most, of, the, message, hours, before, it, was, scheduled, to, be, delivered, pp, 2ff, the, final, part, of, the, message, is, sometimes, described, as, a, declaration, of, war, while, it, was, viewed, by, a, number, of, senior, american, government, and, military, officials, as, a, very, strong, indicator, negotiations, were, likely, to, be, terminated, and, that, war, might, break, out, at, any, moment, it, neither, declared, war, nor, severed, diplomatic, relations, a, declaration, of, war, was, printed, on, the, front, page, of, japan, s, newspapers, in, the, evening, edition, of, december, 8, late, december, 7, in, the, united, states, but, not, delivered, to, the, american, government, until, the, day, after, the, attack, for, decades, conventional, wisdom, held, that, japan, attacked, without, first, formally, breaking, diplomatic, relations, only, because, of, accidents, and, bumbling, that, delayed, the, delivery, of, a, document, hinting, at, war, to, washington, in, 1999, however, takeo, iguchi, a, professor, of, law, and, international, relations, at, international, christian, university, in, tokyo, discovered, documents, that, pointed, to, a, vigorous, debate, inside, the, government, over, how, and, indeed, whether, to, notify, washington, of, japan, s, intention, to, break, off, negotiations, and, start, a, war, including, a, december, 7, entry, in, the, war, diary, saying, ur, deceptive, diplomacy, is, steadily, proceeding, toward, success, of, this, iguchi, said, the, diary, shows, that, the, army, and, navy, did, not, want, to, give, any, proper, declaration, of, war, or, indeed, prior, notice, even, of, the, termination, of, negotiations, and, they, clearly, prevailed, in, any, event, even, if, the, japanese, had, decoded, and, delivered, the, 14, part, message, before, the, beginning, of, the, attack, it, would, not, have, constituted, either, a, formal, break, of, diplomatic, relations, or, a, declaration, of, war, the, final, two, paragraphs, of, the, message, read, thus, the, earnest, hope, of, the, japanese, government, to, adjust, japanese, american, relations, and, to, preserve, and, promote, the, peace, of, the, pacific, through, cooperation,

of, the, pearl, harbor, s, remaining, warships, and, damage, the, base, s, maintenance, shops, drydock, facilities, and, oil, tank, yards, most, notably, fuchida, gave, a, firsthand, account, of, this, meeting, several, times, after, the, war, however, some, historians, have, cast, doubt, on, this, and, many, other, of, fuchida, s, later, claims, which, sometimes, conflict, with, documented, historic, records, genda, who, opined, during, the, planning, for, the, attack, that, without, an, invasion, three, strikes, were, necessary, to, fully, disable, the, pacific, fleet, denied, requesting, an, additional, attack, regardless, it, is, undisputed, that, the, captains, of, the, other, five, carriers, in, the, task, force, reported, they, were, willing, and, ready, to, carry, out, a, third, strike, soon, after, the, second, returned, but, nagumo, decided, to, withdraw, for, several, reasons, although, a, hypothetical, third, strike, would, have, likely, focused, on, the, base, s, remaining, warships, military, historians, have, suggested, any, potential, damage, to, the, shore, facilities, would, have, hampered, the, pacific, fleet, far, more, seriously, if, they, had, been, wiped, out, serious, operations, in, the, pacific, would, have, been, postponed, for, more, than, a, year, according, to, admiral, chester, w, nimitz, later, commander, in, chief, of, the, pacific, fleet, it, would, have, prolonged, the, war, another, two, years, at, a, conference, aboard, his, flagship, the, following, morning, yamamoto, supported, nagumo, s, withdrawal, without, launching, a, third, wave, in, retrospect, sparing, the, vital, dockyards, maintenance, shops, and, the, oil, tank, farm, meant, the, united, states, could, respond, relatively, quickly, in, the, pacific, yamamoto, later, regretted, nagumo, s, decision, to, withdraw, and, categorically, stated, it, had, been, a, great, mistake, not, to, order, a, third, strike, twenty, one, american, ships, were, damaged, or, lost, in, the, attack, of, which, all, but, three, were, repaired, and, returned, to, service, after, a, systematic, search, for, survivors, captain, homer, n, wallin, was, ordered,

had, accumulated, in, the, ship, s, interior, when, feasible, armament, and, equipment, were, removed, from, vessels, too, damaged, to, repair, and, put, to, use, to, improve, the, anti, aircraft, defense, of, the, harbor, or, installed, aboard, other, craft, the, initial, announcement, of, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, was, made, by, the, white, house, press, secretary, stephen, early, at, 2, 22, p, m, eastern, time, 8, 52, a, m, hawaiian, time, the, japanese, have, attacked, pearl, harbor, from, the, air, and, all, naval, and, military, activities, on, the, island, of, oahu, principal, american, base, in, the, hawaiian, islands, as, information, developed, early, made, a, number, of, additional, announcements, to, approximately, 150, white, house, reporters, over, the, course, of, the, afternoon, initial, reports, of, the, attack, moved, on, news, wires, at, approximately, 2, 25, p, m, eastern, time, the, first, radio, coverage, which, at, the, time, represented, the, earliest, opportunity, for, ordinary, people, to, learn, of, the, attack, was, on, the, cbs, radio, network, s, scheduled, news, program, world, news, today, at, 2, 30, p, m, eastern, time, john, charles, daly, read, the, initial, report, then, switched, to, london, where, robert, trout, ad, libbed, on, the, possible, london, reaction, the, first, report, on, nbc, cut, into, a, play, a, dramatization, of, the, inspector, general, at, 2, 33, p, m, eastern, time, and, lasted, only, 21, seconds, unlike, the, later, practice, with, major, news, stories, there, were, only, brief, interruptions, of, scheduled, commercial, programming, the, attacks, were, covered, on, television, but, the, extent, of, it, was, limited, as, commercial, television, had, started, just, 6, months, earlier, a, few, thousand, tv, sets, existed, in, the, united, states, with, most, being, in, the, greater, new, york, city, area, and, only, a, handful, of, stations, existed, which, were, all, in, new, york, chicago, los, angeles, and, philadelphia, wnbt, from, new, york, was, the, only, tv, station, that, was, regularly, airing, that, day, in, the, country, with, the, comedy, movie, millionaire, playboy, which, was, scheduled, for, 3, 30, 4, 30, pm, being, interrupted, with, the, news, of, the, attack, the, other, station, known, to, cover, the, attacks, was, wcbw, also, out, of, new, york, where, a, special, report, on, the, attack, was, broadcast, that, evening, there, are, no, recordings, of, either, stations, coverage, either, visual, or, audio, a, contemporaneous, newspaper, report, compared, the, attack, to, the, battle, of, port, arthur, in, which, the, imperial, japanese, navy, attacked, the, imperial, russian, navy, triggering, the, russo, japanese, war, 37, years, prior, modern, writers, have, continued, to, note, parallels, between, the, attacks, albeit, more, dispassionately, news, of, the, attack, was, first, broadcast, at, 11, 30, am, japanese, standard, time, however, it, had, already, been, announced, shortly, after, 7, am, japanese, standard, time, that, japan, had, entered, into, a, situation, of, war, with, the, united, states, and, britain, in, the, western, pacific, before, dawn, there, was, no, further, elaboration, or, explanation, and, the, attacks, were, already, finished, by, that, time, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, was, eventually, covered, in, the, japanese, press, but, press, in, wartime, japan, was, heavily, censored, one, japanese, newspaper, the, asahi, shimbun, did, report, on, the, attack, the, day, it, occurred, and, from, that, point, onward, their, editorials, began, to, back, governmental, decisions, regardless, of, what, they, were, the, asahi, shimbun, also, reported, the, declaration, of, war, on, the, united, states, after, the, attacks, framing, it, as, an, imperial, order, with, most, japanese, people, taking, it, that, way, in, contrast, coverage, in, the, new, york, times, focused, on, the, danger, to, democracy, and, to, the, nation, brought, on, by, the, japanese, attack, nhk, broadcast, 12, special, news, reports, along, with, its, 6, regularly, scheduled, ones, that, day, the, day, after, the, attack, u, s, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, delivered, his, famous, day, of, infamy, speech, to, a, joint, session, of, congress, calling, for, a, formal, declaration, of, war, on, the, empire, of, japan, congress, obliged, his, request, less, than, an, hour, later, on, december, 11, germany, and, italy, declared, war, on, the, united, states, even, though, the, tripartite, pact, did, not, require, it, congress, issued, a, declaration, of, war, against, germany, and, italy, later, that, same, day, the, united, kingdom, had, already, been, at, war, with, germany, since, september, 1939, and, with, italy, since, june, 1940, and, british, prime, minister, winston, churchill, had, promised, to, declare, war, within, the, hour, of, a, japanese, attack, on, the, united, states, upon, learning, of, the, japanese, attacks, on, malaya, singapore, and, hong, kong, churchill, promptly, determined, there, was, no, need, to, either, wait, or, further, consult, the, us, government, and, immediately, summoned, the, japanese, ambassador, as, a, result, the, united, kingdom, declared, war, on, japan, nine, hours, before, the, united, states, did, the, attack, was, an, initial, shock, to, all, the, allies, in, the, pacific, theater, further, losses, compounded, the, alarming, setback, japan, attacked, the, philippines, hours, later, because, of, the, time, difference, it, was, december, 8, in, the, philippines, only, three, days, after, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, the, battleship, prince, of, wales, and, battlecruiser, repulse, were, sunk, off, the, coast, of, malaya, causing, churchill, later, to, recollect, in, all, the, war, i, never, received, a, more, direct, shock, as, i, turned, and, twisted, in, bed, the, full, horror, of, the, news, sank, in, upon, me, there, were, no, british, or, american, capital, ships, in, the, indian, ocean, or, the, pacific, except, the, american, survivors, of, pearl, harbor, who, were, hastening, back, to, california, over, this, vast, expanse, of, waters, japan, was, supreme, and, we, everywhere, were, weak, and, naked, throughout, the, war, pearl, harbor, was, frequently, used, in, american, propaganda, one, further, consequence, of, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, and, its, aftermath, notably, the, niihau, incident, was, that, japanese, american, residents, and, citizens, were, relocated, to, nearby, japanese, american, internment, camps, within, hours, of, the, attack, hundreds, of, japanese, american, leaders, were, rounded, up, and, taken, to, high, security, camps, such, as, sand, island, at, the, mouth, of, honolulu, harbor, and, kilauea, military, camp, on, the, island, of, hawaii, eventually, more, than, 110, 000, japanese, americans, nearly, all, who, lived, on, the, west, coast, were, forced, into, interior, camps, but, in, hawaii, where, the, 150, 000, plus, japanese, americans, composed, over, one, third, of, the, population, only, 1, 200, to, 1, 800, were, interned, the, attack, also, had, international, consequences, the, canadian, province, of, british, columbia, bordering, the, pacific, ocean, had, long, had, a, large, population, of, japanese, immigrants, and, their, japanese, canadian, descendants, pre, war, tensions, were, exacerbated, by, the, pearl, harbor, attack, leading, to, a, reaction, from, the, government, of, canada, on, february, 24, 1942, order, in, council, p, c, no, 1486, was, passed, under, the, war, measures, act, allowing, for, the, forced, removal, of, any, and, all, canadians, of, japanese, descent, from, british, columbia, as, well, as, prohibiting, them, from, returning, to, the, province, on, march, 4, regulations, under, the, act, were, adopted, to, evacuate, japanese, canadians, as, a, result, 12, 000, were, interned, in, interior, camps, 2, 000, were, sent, to, road, camps, and, another, 2, 000, were, forced, to, work, in, the, prairies, on, sugar, beet, farms, in, the, wake, of, the, attack, 15, medals, of, honor, 51, navy, crosses, 53, silver, stars, four, navy, and, marine, corps, medals, one, distinguished, flying, cross, four, distinguished, service, crosses, one, distinguished, service, medal, and, three, bronze, star, medals, were, awarded, to, the, american, servicemen, who, distinguished, themselves, in, combat, at, pearl, harbor, additionally, a, special, military, award, the, pearl, harbor, commemorative, medal, was, later, authorized, for, all, military, veterans, of, the, attack, japanese, planners, of, the, pearl, harbor, attack, had, determined, that, some, means, were, required, for, rescuing, fliers, whose, aircraft, were, damaged, too, badly, to, return, to, the, carriers, the, island, of, niihau, only, thirty, minutes, by, air, from, pearl, harbor, was, designated, as, the, rescue, point, during, the, second, wave, a, zero, fighter, flown, by, petty, officer, shigenori, nishikaichi, of, hiryu, was, damaged, in, the, attack, on, wheeler, so, he, flew, to, the, rescue, point, the, aircraft, was, further, damaged, on, his, crash, landing, nishikaichi, was, helped, from, the, wreckage, by, one, of, the, native, hawaiians, who, aware, of, the, tension, between, the, united, states, and, japan, took, the, pilot, s, pistol, maps, codes, and, other, documents, the, island, s, residents, had, no, telephones, or, radios, and, were, completely, unaware, of, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, nishikaichi, enlisted, the, support, of, three, japanese, american, residents, in, an, attempt, to, recover, the, documents, during, the, ensuing, struggles, nishikaichi, was, killed, and, a, hawaiian, civilian, was, wounded, one, collaborator, committed, suicide, and, his, wife, and, the, third, collaborator, were, sent, to, prison, the, ease, with, which, the, local, ethnic, japanese, residents, had, apparently, gone, to, nishikaichi, s, assistance, was, a, source, of, concern, for, many, and, tended, to, support, those, who, believed, that, local, japanese, could, not, be, trusted, rear, admiral, ch, ichi, hara, summed, up, the, japanese, result, by, saying, we, won, a, great, tactical, victory, at, pearl, harbor, and, thereby, lost, the, war, while, the, attack, accomplished, its, intended, objective, it, turned, out, to, be, largely, unnecessary, unbeknownst, to, yamamoto, who, conceived, the, original, plan, the, united, states, navy, had, decided, as, far, back, as, 1935, to, abandon, charging, across, the, pacific, towards, the, philippines, in, response, to, an, outbreak, of, war, in, keeping, with, the, evolution, of, plan, orange, the, united, states, instead, adopted, plan, dog, in, 1940, which, emphasized, keeping, the, ijn, out, of, the, eastern, pacific, and, away, from, the, shipping, lanes, to, australia, while, the, united, states, concentrated, on, defeating, nazi, germany, fortunately, for, the, united, states, the, american, aircraft, carriers, were, untouched, otherwise, the, pacific, fleet, s, ability, to, conduct, offensive, operations, would, have, been, crippled, for, a, year, or, more, given, no, diversions, from, the, atlantic, fleet, as, it, was, the, navy, was, left, with, no, choice, but, to, rely, on, carriers, and, submarines, while, six, of, the, eight, battleships, were, repaired, and, returned, to, service, their, relatively, low, speed, and, high, fuel, consumption, limited, their, deployment, and, they, served, mainly, in, shore, bombardment, roles, their, only, major, action, being, the, battle, of, surigao, strait, in, october, 1944, a, major, flaw, in, japanese, strategic, thinking, was, a, belief, that, the, ultimate, pacific, battle, would, be, fought, by, battleships, in, keeping, with, the, doctrine, of, captain, alfred, thayer, mahan, as, a, result, yamamoto, and, his, successors, hoarded, battleships, for, a, decisive, battle, that, never, happened, the, japanese, confidence, in, their, ability, to, win, a, quick, victory, meant, that, they, neglected, pearl, harbor, s, navy, repair, yards, oil, tank, farms, submarine, base, and, old, headquarters, building, all, of, these, targets, were, omitted, from, genda, s, list, yet, they, proved, more, important, than, any, battleship, to, the, american, war, effort, in, the, pacific, the, survival, of, the, repair, shops, and, fuel, depots, allowed, pearl, harbor, to, maintain, logistical, support, of, the, navy, such, as, the, doolittle, raid, and, the, battles, of, the, coral, sea, and, midway, it, was, submarines, that, immobilized, the, imperial, japanese, navy, s, heavy, ships, and, brought, japan, s, economy, to, a, virtual, standstill, by, crippling, the, importation, of, oil, and, raw, materials, by, the, end, of, 1942, the, amount, of, raw, materials, brought, in, was, cut, in, half, to, a, disastrous, ten, million, tons, while, oil, was, almost, completely, stopped, lastly, the, basement, of, the, old, administration, building, was, the, home, of, the, cryptanalytic, unit, which, contributed, significantly, to, the, midway, ambush, and, the, submarine, force, s, success, ever, since, the, japanese, attack, there, has, been, debate, as, to, how, and, why, the, united, states, had, been, caught, unaware, and, how, much, and, when, american, officials, knew, of, japanese, plans, and, related, topics, as, early, as, 1924, chief, of, united, states, air, service, mason, patrick, showed, concern, for, military, vulnerabilities, in, the, pacific, having, sent, general, billy, mitchell, on, a, survey, of, the, pacific, and, the, east, patrick, called, mitchell, s, subsequent, report, which, identified, vulnerabilities, in, hawaii, a, theoretical, treatise, on, employment, of, airpower, in, the, pacific, which, in, all, probability, undoubtedly, will, be, of, extreme, value, some, 10, or, 15, years, hence, at, least, two, naval, war, games, one, in, 1932, and, another, in, 1936, proved, that, pearl, was, vulnerable, to, such, an, attack, admiral, james, richardson, was, removed, from, command, shortly, after, protesting, president, roosevelt, s, decision, to, move, the, bulk, of, the, pacific, fleet, to, pearl, harbor, the, decisions, of, military, and, political, leadership, to, ignore, these, warnings, have, contributed, to, conspiracy, theories, several, writers, including, decorated, world, war, ii, veteran, and, journalist, robert, stinnett, author, of, day, of, deceit, and, former, united, states, rear, admiral, robert, alfred, theobald, author, of, the, final, secret, of, pearl, harbor, the, washington, background, of, the, pearl, harbor, attack, have, argued, that, various, parties, high, in, the, american, and, british, governments, knew, of, the, attack, in, advance, and, may, even, have, let, it, happen, or, encouraged, it, in, order, to, force, the, united, states, into, the, war, via, the, so, called, back, door, however, this, conspiracy, theory, is, rejected, by, mainstream, historians, the, theory, that, the, americans, were, warned, in, advance, however, is, supported, by, statements, made, by, dick, ellis, a, british, australian, intelligence, officer, for, mi6, who, helped, william, j,
