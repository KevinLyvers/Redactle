arms, race, was, an, arms, race, competition, for, supremacy, in, nuclear, warfare, between, the, united, states, the, soviet, union, and, their, respective, allies, during, the, cold, war, during, this, same, period, in, addition, to, the, american, and, soviet, nuclear, stockpiles, other, countries, developed, nuclear, weapons, though, no, other, country, engaged, in, warhead, production, on, nearly, the, same, scale, as, the, two, superpowers, the, first, nuclear, weapon, was, created, by, the, united, states, of, america, during, the, second, world, war, and, was, developed, to, be, used, against, the, axis, powers, scientists, of, the, soviet, union, were, aware, of, the, potential, of, nuclear, weapons, and, had, also, been, conducting, research, in, the, field, the, soviet, union, was, not, informed, officially, of, the, manhattan, project, until, stalin, was, briefed, at, the, potsdam, conference, on, july, 24, 1945, by, u, s, president, harry, s, truman, eight, days, after, the, first, successful, test, of, a, nuclear, weapon, despite, their, wartime, military, alliance, the, united, states, and, britain, had, not, trusted, the, soviets, enough, to, keep, knowledge, of, the, manhattan, project, safe, from, german, spies, there, were, also, concerns, that, as, an, ally, the, soviet, union, would, request, and, expect, to, receive, technical, details, of, the, new, weapon, when, president, truman, informed, stalin, of, the, weapons, he, was, surprised, at, how, calmly, stalin, reacted, to, the, news, and, thought, that, stalin, had, not, understood, what, he, had, been, told, other, members, of, the, united, states, and, british, delegations, who, closely, observed, the, exchange, formed, the, same, conclusion, in, fact, stalin, had, long, been, aware, of, the, program, despite, the, manhattan, project, s, having, a, secret, classification, so, high, that, even, as, vice, president, truman, did, not, know, about, it, or, the, development, of, the, weapons, truman, was, not, informed, until, shortly, after, he, became, president, a, ring, of, spies, operating, within, the, manhattan, project, including, klaus, fuchs, and, theodore, hall, had, kept, stalin, well, informed, of, american, progress, they, provided, the, soviets, with, detailed, designs, of, the, implosion, bomb, and, the, hydrogen, bomb, fuchs, arrest, in, 1950, led, to, the, arrests, of, many, other, suspected, russian, spies, including, harry, gold, david, greenglass, and, ethel, and, julius, rosenberg, the, latter, two, were, tried, and, executed, for, espionage, in, 1951, in, august, 1945, on, truman, s, orders, two, atomic, bombs, were, dropped, on, japanese, cities, the, first, bomb, was, dropped, on, hiroshima, and, the, second, bomb, was, dropped, on, nagasaki, by, the, b, 29, bombers, named, enola, gay, and, bockscar, respectively, shortly, after, the, end, of, the, second, world, war, in, 1945, the, united, nations, was, founded, during, the, united, nation, s, first, general, assembly, in, london, in, january, 1946, they, discussed, the, future, of, nuclear, weapons, and, created, the, united, nations, atomic, energy, commission, the, goal, of, this, assembly, was, to, eliminate, the, use, of, all, nuclear, weapons, the, united, states, presented, their, solution, which, was, called, the, baruch, plan, this, plan, proposed, that, there, should, be, an, international, authority, that, controls, all, dangerous, atomic, activities, the, soviet, union, disagreed, with, this, proposal, and, rejected, it, the, soviets, proposal, involved, universal, nuclear, disarmament, both, the, american, and, soviet, proposals, were, refused, by, the, un, in, the, years, immediately, after, the, second, world, war, the, united, states, had, a, monopoly, on, specific, knowledge, of, and, raw, materials, for, nuclear, weaponry, american, leaders, hoped, that, their, exclusive, ownership, of, nuclear, weapons, would, be, enough, to, draw, concessions, from, the, soviet, union, but, this, proved, ineffective, just, six, months, after, the, un, general, assembly, the, united, states, conducted, its, first, post, war, nuclear, tests, operation, crossroads, the, purpose, of, this, operation, was, to, test, the, effect, of, nuclear, explosions, on, ships, these, tests, were, performed, at, bikini, atoll, in, the, pacific, on, 95, ships, including, german, and, japanese, ships, that, were, captured, during, world, war, ii, one, plutonium, implosion, type, bomb, was, detonated, over, the, fleet, while, the, other, one, was, detonated, underwater, in, secrecy, the, soviet, government, was, working, on, building, its, own, atomic, weapons, during, the, war, soviet, efforts, had, been, limited, by, a, lack, of, uranium, but, new, supplies, discovered, in, eastern, europe, provided, a, steady, supply, while, the, soviets, developed, a, domestic, source, while, american, experts, had, predicted, that, the, soviet, union, would, not, have, nuclear, weapons, until, the, mid, 1950s, the, first, soviet, bomb, was, detonated, on, august, 29, 1949, the, bomb, named, first, lightning, by, the, west, was, more, or, less, a, copy, of, fat, man, one, of, the, bombs, the, united, states, had, dropped, on, japan, in, 1945, both, governments, spent, massive, amounts, to, increase, the, quality, and, quantity, of, their, nuclear, arsenals, both, nations, quickly, began, the, development, of, thermonuclear, weapons, which, can, achieve, vastly, greater, explosive, yields, the, united, states, detonated, the, first, hydrogen, bomb, on, november, 1, 1952, on, enewetak, an, atoll, in, the, pacific, ocean, code, named, ivy, mike, the, project, was, led, by, edward, teller, a, hungarian, american, nuclear, physicist, it, created, a, cloud, 100, miles, 160, km, wide, and, 25, miles, 40, km, high, killing, all, life, on, the, surrounding, islands, again, the, soviets, surprised, the, world, by, exploding, a, deployable, thermonuclear, device, in, august, 1953, although, it, was, not, a, true, multi, stage, hydrogen, bomb, however, it, was, small, enough, to, be, dropped, from, an, airplane, making, it, ready, for, use, the, development, of, these, two, soviet, bombs, was, greatly, aided, by, the, russian, spies, harry, gold, and, klaus, fuchs, on, march, 1, 1954, the, u, s, conducted, the, castle, bravo, test, which, tested, another, hydrogen, bomb, on, bikini, atoll, scientists, significantly, underestimated, the, size, of, the, bomb, thinking, it, would, yield, 5, megatons, however, it, yielded, 14, 8, megatons, the, highest, yield, ever, achieved, by, an, american, nuclear, device, the, explosion, was, so, large, the, nuclear, fallout, exposed, residents, up, to, 300, miles, 480, km, away, to, significant, amounts, of, radiation, they, were, eventually, evacuated, but, most, experienced, radiation, poisoning, one, person, was, killed, a, crew, member, on, a, japanese, fishing, boat, which, was, 90, miles, 140, km, from, the, bomb, test, site, when, the, explosion, occurred, the, soviet, union, detonated, its, first, true, hydrogen, bomb, on, november, 22, 1955, which, had, a, yield, of, 1, 6, megatons, on, october, 30, 1961, the, soviets, detonated, a, hydrogen, bomb, with, a, yield, of, approximately, 58, megatons, with, both, sides, in, the, cold, war, having, nuclear, capability, an, arms, race, developed, with, the, soviet, union, attempting, first, to, catch, up, and, then, to, surpass, the, americans, strategic, bombers, were, the, primary, delivery, method, at, the, beginning, of, the, cold, war, missiles, had, long, been, regarded, the, ideal, platform, for, nuclear, weapons, and, were, potentially, a, more, effective, delivery, system, than, bombers, starting, in, the, 1950s, medium, range, ballistic, missiles, and, intermediate, range, ballistic, missiles, irbm, s, were, developed, for, delivery, of, tactical, nuclear, weapons, and, the, technology, developed, to, the, progressively, longer, ranges, eventually, becoming, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, icbms, on, october, 4, 1957, the, soviet, union, launched, the, first, artificial, satellite, sputnik, 1, into, an, orbit, around, the, earth, demonstrating, that, soviet, icbms, were, capable, of, reaching, any, point, on, the, planet, the, united, states, launched, its, first, satellite, explorer, 1, on, january, 31, 1958, meanwhile, submarine, launched, ballistic, missiles, were, also, developed, by, the, mid, 1960s, the, triad, of, nuclear, weapon, delivery, was, established, with, each, side, deploying, bombers, icbms, and, slbms, in, order, to, ensure, that, even, if, a, defense, was, found, against, one, delivery, method, the, other, methods, would, still, be, available, some, in, the, united, states, during, the, early, 1960s, pointed, out, that, although, all, of, the, individual, components, of, nuclear, missiles, had, been, tested, separately, warheads, navigation, systems, rockets, it, was, infeasible, to, test, them, all, combined, critics, charged, that, it, was, not, really, known, how, a, warhead, would, react, to, the, gravity, forces, and, temperature, differences, encountered, in, the, upper, atmosphere, and, outer, space, and, kennedy, was, unwilling, to, run, a, test, of, an, icbm, with, a, live, warhead, the, closest, event, to, an, actual, test, was, 1962, s, operation, frigate, bird, in, which, the, submarine, uss, ethan, allen, ssbn, 608, launched, a, polaris, a2, missile, over, 1, 000, miles, 1, 600, km, to, the, nuclear, test, site, at, christmas, island, it, was, challenged, by, among, others, curtis, lemay, who, put, missile, accuracy, into, doubt, to, encourage, the, development, of, new, bombers, other, critics, pointed, out, that, it, was, a, single, test, which, could, be, an, anomaly, that, it, was, a, lower, altitude, slbm, and, therefore, was, subject, to, different, conditions, than, an, icbm, and, that, significant, modifications, had, been, made, to, its, warhead, before, testing, by, the, mid, 1960s, both, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, had, enough, nuclear, power, to, obliterate, their, opponent, both, sides, developed, a, capability, to, launch, a, devastating, attack, even, after, sustaining, a, full, assault, from, the, other, side, especially, by, means, of, submarines, called, a, second, strike, this, policy, became, known, as, mutual, assured, destruction, both, sides, knew, that, any, attack, upon, the, other, would, be, devastating, to, themselves, thus, in, theory, restraining, them, from, attacking, the, other, both, soviet, and, american, experts, hoped, to, use, nuclear, weapons, for, extracting, concessions, from, the, other, or, from, other, powers, such, as, china, but, the, risk, connected, with, using, these, weapons, was, so, grave, that, they, refrained, from, what, john, foster, dulles, referred, to, as, brinkmanship, while, some, like, general, douglas, macarthur, argued, nuclear, weapons, should, be, used, during, the, korean, war, both, truman, and, eisenhower, opposed, the, idea, both, sides, were, unaware, of, the, details, of, the, capacity, of, the, enemy, s, arsenal, of, nuclear, weapons, the, americans, suffered, from, a, lack, of, confidence, and, in, the, 1950s, they, believed, in, a, non, existing, bomber, gap, aerial, photography, later, revealed, that, the, soviets, had, been, playing, a, sort, of, potemkin, village, game, with, their, bombers, in, their, military, parades, flying, them, in, large, circles, making, it, appear, they, had, far, more, than, they, truly, did, the, 1960, american, presidential, election, saw, accusations, of, a, wholly, spurious, missile, gap, between, the, soviets, and, the, americans, on, the, other, side, the, soviet, government, exaggerated, the, power, of, soviet, weapons, to, the, leadership, and, soviet, first, secretary, nikita, khrushchev, in, addition, to, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, three, other, nations, the, united, kingdom, the, people, s, republic, of, china, and, france, developed, nuclear, weapons, during, the, early, cold, war, years, in, 1952, the, united, kingdom, became, the, third, nation, to, test, a, nuclear, weapon, when, it, detonated, an, atomic, bomb, in, operation, hurricane, on, october, 3, 1952, which, had, a, yield, of, 25, kilotons, despite, major, contributions, to, the, manhattan, project, by, both, canadian, and, british, governments, the, u, s, congress, passed, the, atomic, energy, act, of, 1946, which, prohibited, multi, national, cooperation, on, nuclear, projects, the, atomic, energy, act, fueled, resentment, from, british, scientists, and, winston, churchill, as, they, believed, that, there, were, agreements, regarding, post, war, sharing, of, nuclear, technology, and, led, to, britain, s, developing, its, nuclear, weapons, britain, did, not, begin, planning, the, development, of, its, nuclear, weapon, until, january, 1947, because, of, britain, s, small, size, they, decided, to, test, their, bomb, on, the, montebello, islands, off, the, coast, of, australia, following, this, successful, test, under, the, leadership, of, churchill, britain, decided, to, develop, and, test, a, hydrogen, bomb, the, first, successful, hydrogen, bomb, test, occurred, on, november, 8, 1957, which, had, a, yield, of, 1, 8, megatons, an, amendment, to, the, atomic, energy, act, in, 1958, allowed, nuclear, cooperation, once, again, and, british, u, s, nuclear, programs, resumed, during, the, cold, war, british, nuclear, deterrence, came, from, submarines, and, nuclear, armed, aircraft, the, resolution, class, ballistic, missile, submarines, armed, with, the, american, built, polaris, missile, provided, the, sea, deterrent, while, aircraft, such, as, the, avro, vulcan, sepecat, jaguar, panavia, tornado, and, several, other, royal, air, force, strike, aircraft, carrying, the, we, 177, gravity, bomb, provided, the, air, deterrent, france, became, the, fourth, nation, to, possess, nuclear, weapons, on, february, 13, 1960, when, the, atomic, bomb, gerboise, bleue, was, detonated, in, algeria, then, still, a, french, colony, formally, a, part, of, metropolitan, france, france, began, making, plans, for, a, nuclear, weapons, program, shortly, after, the, second, world, war, but, the, program, did, not, begin, until, the, late, 1950s, eight, years, later, france, conducted, its, first, thermonuclear, test, above, fangatuafa, atoll, it, had, a, yield, of, 2, 6, megatons, this, bomb, significantly, contaminated, the, atoll, with, radiation, for, six, years, making, it, off, limits, to, humans, during, the, cold, war, the, french, nuclear, deterrent, was, centered, around, the, force, de, frappe, a, nuclear, triad, consisting, of, dassault, mirage, iv, bombers, carrying, such, nuclear, weapons, as, the, an, 22, gravity, bomb, and, the, asmp, stand, off, attack, missile, pluton, and, hades, ballistic, missiles, and, the, redoutable, class, submarine, armed, with, strategic, nuclear, missiles, the, people, s, republic, of, china, became, the, fifth, nuclear, power, on, october, 16, 1964, when, it, detonated, a, 25, kiloton, uranium, 235, bomb, in, a, test, codenamed, 596, at, lop, nur, in, the, late, 1950s, china, began, developing, nuclear, weapons, with, substantial, soviet, assistance, in, exchange, for, uranium, ore, however, the, sino, soviet, ideological, split, in, the, late, 1950s, developed, problems, between, china, and, the, soviet, union, this, caused, the, soviets, to, cease, helping, china, develop, nuclear, weapons, however, china, continued, developing, nuclear, weapons, without, soviet, support, and, made, remarkable, progress, in, the, 1960s, owing, to, soviet, chinese, tensions, the, chinese, might, have, used, nuclear, weapons, against, either, the, united, states, or, the, soviet, union, in, the, event, of, a, nuclear, war, between, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, during, the, cold, war, the, chinese, nuclear, deterrent, consisted, of, gravity, bombs, carried, aboard, h, 6, bomber, aircraft, missile, systems, such, as, the, df, 2, df, 3, and, df, 4, and, in, the, later, stages, of, the, cold, war, the, type, 092, ballistic, missile, submarine, on, june, 14, 1967, china, detonated, its, first, hydrogen, bomb, on, january, 1, 1959, the, cuban, government, fell, to, communist, revolutionaries, propelling, fidel, castro, into, power, the, communist, soviet, union, supported, and, praised, castro, and, his, resistance, and, the, revolutionary, government, was, recognized, by, the, soviet, union, on, january, 10, when, the, united, states, began, boycotting, cuban, sugar, the, soviet, union, began, purchasing, large, quantities, to, support, the, cuban, economy, in, return, for, fuel, and, eventually, placing, nuclear, ballistic, missiles, on, cuban, soil, these, missiles, would, be, capable, of, reaching, the, united, states, very, quickly, on, october, 14, 1962, an, american, spy, plane, discovered, these, nuclear, missile, sites, under, construction, in, cuba, president, kennedy, immediately, called, a, series, of, meetings, for, a, small, group, of, senior, officials, to, debate, the, crisis, the, group, was, split, between, a, militaristic, solution, and, a, diplomatic, one, president, kennedy, ordered, a, naval, blockade, around, cuba, and, all, military, forces, to, defcon, 3, as, tensions, increased, kennedy, eventually, ordered, u, s, military, forces, to, defcon, 2, this, was, the, closest, the, world, has, been, to, a, nuclear, war, while, the, u, s, military, had, been, ordered, to, defcon, 2, the, theory, of, mutually, assured, destruction, suggests, that, entry, into, nuclear, war, is, an, unlikely, possibility, while, the, public, perceived, the, cuban, missile, crisis, as, a, time, of, near, mass, destruction, the, leaders, of, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, were, working, confidentially, in, order, to, allow, the, crisis, to, come, to, a, peaceful, conclusion, soviet, first, secretary, khrushchev, wrote, to, president, kennedy, in, a, telegram, on, october, 26, 1962, saying, that, consequently, if, there, is, no, intention, to, tighten, that, knot, and, thereby, to, doom, the, world, to, the, catastrophe, of, thermonuclear, war, then, let, us, not, only, relax, the, forces, pulling, on, the, ends, of, the, rope, let, us, take, measures, to, untie, that, knot, eventually, on, october, 28, through, much, discussion, between, u, s, and, soviet, officials, khrushchev, announced, that, the, soviet, union, would, withdraw, all, missiles, from, cuba, shortly, afterwards, the, u, s, withdrew, all, their, nuclear, missiles, from, turkey, in, secret, the, presence, of, the, missiles, having, threatened, the, soviets, information, that, the, u, s, had, withdrawn, their, jupiter, missiles, from, turkey, remained, confidential, for, decades, causing, the, result, of, the, negotiations, between, the, two, nations, to, appear, to, the, world, as, a, major, u, s, victory, this, ultimately, led, to, the, downfall, of, soviet, leader, khrushchev, by, the, 1970s, with, the, cold, war, s, entering, its, 30th, year, with, no, direct, conflict, between, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, the, superpowers, entered, a, period, of, reduced, conflict, in, which, the, two, powers, engaged, in, trade, and, exchanges, with, each, other, this, period, was, known, as, d, tente, this, period, included, negotiation, of, a, number, of, arms, control, agreements, building, with, the, nuclear, test, ban, treaty, in, the, 1950s, but, with, significant, new, treaties, negotiated, in, the, 1970s, these, treaties, were, only, partially, successful, although, both, states, continued, to, hold, massive, numbers, of, nuclear, weapons, and, research, more, effective, technology, the, growth, in, number, of, warheads, was, first, limited, and, later, with, the, start, i, reversed, in, 1958, both, the, u, s, and, soviet, union, informally, agreed, to, suspend, nuclear, testing, however, this, agreement, was, ended, when, the, soviets, resumed, testing, in, 1961, followed, by, a, series, of, nuclear, tests, conducted, by, the, u, s, these, events, led, to, much, political, fallout, as, well, as, the, cuban, missile, crisis, in, 1962, it, was, felt, by, american, and, soviet, leaders, that, something, had, to, be, done, to, ease, the, significant, tensions, between, these, two, countries, so, on, october, 10, 1963, the, limited, test, ban, treaty, ltbt, was, signed, this, was, an, agreement, between, the, u, s, the, soviet, union, and, the, u, k, which, significantly, restricted, nuclear, testing, all, atmospheric, underwater, and, outer, space, nuclear, testing, were, agreed, to, be, halted, but, testing, was, still, allowed, underground, an, additional, 113, countries, have, signed, this, treaty, since, 1963, salt, i, and, salt, ii, limited, the, size, of, the, u, s, arsenal, bans, on, nuclear, testing, anti, ballistic, missile, systems, and, weapons, in, space, all, attempted, to, limit, the, expansion, of, the, arms, race, through, the, partial, test, ban, treaty, in, november, 1969, strategic, arms, limitation, talks, salt, begun, this, was, primarily, due, to, the, economic, impact, that, nuclear, testing, and, production, had, on, both, u, s, and, soviet, economies, the, salt, i, treaty, which, was, signed, in, may, 1972, produced, an, agreement, on, two, significant, documents, these, were, the, anti, ballistic, missile, treaty, abm, treaty, and, the, interim, agreement, on, the, limitation, of, strategic, offensive, arms, the, abm, treaty, limited, each, country, to, two, abm, sites, while, the, interim, agreement, froze, each, country, s, number, of, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, icbms, and, submarine, launched, ballistic, missiles, slbms, at, current, levels, for, five, years, this, treaty, significantly, reduced, nuclear, related, costs, as, well, as, the, risk, of, nuclear, war, however, salt, i, failed, to, address, how, many, nuclear, warheads, could, be, placed, on, a, single, missile, a, new, technology, known, as, multiple, independently, targetable, re, entry, vehicle, mirv, allowed, single, missiles, to, hold, and, launch, multiple, nuclear, missiles, at, targets, while, in, mid, air, over, the, next, 10, years, the, soviet, union, and, u, s, added, 12, 000, nuclear, warheads, to, their, already, built, arsenals, throughout, the, 1970s, both, the, soviet, union, and, united, states, replaced, older, warheads, and, missiles, with, newer, more, powerful, and, effective, ones, on, june, 18, 1979, the, salt, ii, treaty, was, signed, in, vienna, this, treaty, limited, both, sides, nuclear, arsenals, and, technology, however, in, light, of, the, soviet, union, s, invasion, of, afghanistan, in, december, 1979, the, united, states, senate, never, ratified, the, salt, ii, treaty, this, ended, the, treaty, negotiations, as, well, as, the, era, of, d, tente, in, 1991, the, start, strategic, arms, reduction, treaty, was, negotiated, between, the, u, s, and, the, soviet, union, to, reduce, the, number, and, limit, the, capabilities, of, limitation, of, strategic, offensive, arms, this, was, eventually, succeeded, by, the, start, ii, start, iii, and, new, start, treaties, despite, d, tente, both, sides, continued, to, develop, and, introduce, not, only, more, accurate, weapons, but, weapons, with, more, warheads, mirvs, the, presidency, of, ronald, reagan, proposed, a, missile, defense, programme, tagged, the, strategic, defense, initiative, a, space, based, anti, ballistic, missile, system, derided, as, star, wars, by, its, critics, simultaneously, missile, defense, was, also, being, researched, in, the, soviet, union, however, the, sdi, would, require, technology, that, had, not, yet, been, developed, or, even, researched, this, system, proposed, both, space, and, earth, based, laser, battle, stations, it, would, also, need, sensors, on, the, ground, in, the, air, and, in, space, with, radar, optical, and, infrared, technology, to, detect, incoming, missiles, simultaneously, however, reagan, initiated, negotiations, with, mikhail, gorbachev, ultimately, resulting, in, the, strategic, arms, reduction, treaty, on, reducing, nuclear, stockpiles, owing, to, high, costs, and, complex, technology, for, its, time, the, scope, of, the, sdi, project, was, reduced, from, defense, against, a, massive, attack, to, a, system, for, defending, against, limited,
