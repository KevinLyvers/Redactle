https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl
the, dust, bowl, was, the, result, of, a, period, of, severe, dust, storms, that, greatly, damaged, the, ecology, and, agriculture, of, the, american, and, canadian, prairies, during, the, 1930s, the, phenomenon, was, caused, by, a, combination, of, natural, factors, severe, drought, and, human, made, factors, a, failure, to, apply, dryland, farming, methods, to, prevent, wind, erosion, most, notably, the, destruction, of, the, natural, topsoil, by, settlers, in, the, region, the, drought, came, in, three, waves, 1934, 1936, and, 1939, 1940, but, some, regions, of, the, high, plains, experienced, drought, conditions, for, as, long, as, eight, years, the, dust, bowl, has, been, the, subject, of, many, cultural, works, including, john, steinbeck, s, 1939, novel, the, grapes, of, wrath, the, folk, music, of, woody, guthrie, and, dorothea, lange, s, photographs, depicting, the, conditions, of, migrants, particularly, migrant, mother, taken, in, 1936, the, dust, bowl, area, lies, principally, west, of, the, 100th, meridian, on, the, high, plains, characterized, by, plains, that, vary, from, rolling, in, the, north, to, flat, in, the, llano, estacado, elevation, ranges, from, 2, 500, ft, 760, m, in, the, east, to, 6, 000, ft, 1, 800, m, at, the, base, of, the, rocky, mountains, the, area, is, semiarid, receiving, less, than, 20, in, 510, mm, of, rain, annually, this, rainfall, supports, the, shortgrass, prairie, biome, originally, present, in, the, area, the, region, is, also, prone, to, extended, drought, alternating, with, unusual, wetness, of, equivalent, duration, during, wet, years, the, rich, soil, provides, bountiful, agricultural, output, but, crops, fail, during, dry, years, the, region, is, also, subject, to, high, winds, during, early, european, and, american, exploration, of, the, great, plains, this, region, was, thought, unsuitable, for, european, style, agriculture, explorers, called, it, the, great, american, desert, the, lack, of, surface, water, and, timber, made, the, region, less, attractive, than, other, areas, for, pioneer, settlement, and, agriculture, the, federal, government, encouraged, settlement, and, development, of, the, plains, for, agriculture, via, the, homestead, act, of, 1862, offering, settlers, quarter, section, 160, acre, 65, ha, plots, with, the, end, of, the, civil, war, in, 1865, and, the, completion, of, the, first, transcontinental, railroad, in, 1869, waves, of, new, migrants, and, immigrants, reached, the, great, plains, and, greatly, increased, the, acreage, under, cultivation, an, unusually, wet, period, in, the, great, plains, mistakenly, led, settlers, and, the, federal, government, to, believe, that, rain, follows, the, plow, a, popular, phrase, among, real, estate, promoters, and, that, the, region, s, climate, had, permanently, changed, while, initial, agricultural, endeavors, were, primarily, cattle, ranching, the, harsh, winters, adverse, effect, on, the, cattle, beginning, in, 1886, a, short, drought, in, 1890, and, general, overgrazing, led, many, landowners, to, increase, the, amount, of, land, under, cultivation, recognizing, the, challenge, of, cultivating, marginal, arid, land, the, u, s, government, expanded, on, the, 160, acres, 65, ha, offered, under, the, homestead, act, granting, 640, acres, 260, ha, to, homesteaders, in, western, nebraska, under, the, kinkaid, act, 1904, and, 320, acres, 130, ha, elsewhere, in, the, great, plains, under, the, enlarged, homestead, act, of, 1909, waves, of, european, settlers, arrived, in, the, plains, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, a, return, of, unusually, wet, weather, seemingly, confirmed, a, previously, held, opinion, that, the, formerly, semiarid, area, could, support, large, scale, agriculture, at, the, same, time, technological, improvements, such, as, mechanized, plowing, and, mechanized, harvesting, made, it, possible, to, operate, larger, properties, without, increasing, labor, costs, with, insufficient, understanding, of, the, ecology, of, the, plains, farmers, had, conducted, extensive, deep, plowing, of, the, great, plains, virgin, topsoil, during, the, previous, decade, this, displaced, the, native, deep, rooted, grasses, that, normally, trapped, soil, and, moisture, even, during, periods, of, drought, and, high, winds, the, rapid, mechanization, of, farm, equipment, especially, small, gasoline, tractors, and, widespread, use, of, the, combine, harvester, contributed, to, farmers, decisions, to, convert, arid, grassland, much, of, which, received, no, more, than, 10, inches, 250, mm, of, precipitation, per, year, to, cultivated, cropland, during, the, drought, of, the, 1930s, the, unanchored, soil, turned, to, dust, which, prevailing, winds, blew, away, in, huge, clouds, that, sometimes, blackened, the, sky, these, choking, billows, of, dust, named, black, blizzards, or, black, rollers, traveled, cross, country, reaching, as, far, as, the, east, coast, and, striking, such, cities, as, new, york, city, and, washington, d, c, on, the, plains, they, often, reduced, visibility, to, three, feet, 1, m, or, less, associated, press, reporter, robert, e, geiger, happened, to, be, in, boise, city, oklahoma, to, witness, the, black, sunday, black, blizzards, of, april, 14, 1935, edward, stanley, the, kansas, city, news, editor, of, the, associated, press, coined, the, term, dust, bowl, while, rewriting, geiger, s, news, story, the, term, the, dust, bowl, originally, referred, to, the, geographical, area, affected, by, the, dust, but, today, it, usually, refers, to, the, event, itself, the, term, dirty, thirties, is, also, sometimes, used, the, drought, and, erosion, of, the, dust, bowl, affected, 100, million, acres, 400, 000, km, 2, that, centered, on, the, texas, panhandle, and, oklahoma, panhandle, and, touched, adjacent, sections, of, new, mexico, colorado, and, kansas, the, dust, bowl, forced, tens, of, thousands, of, poverty, stricken, families, who, were, unable, to, pay, mortgages, or, grow, crops, to, abandon, their, farms, and, losses, reached, 25, million, per, day, by, 1936, equivalent, to, 550, million, in, 2023, many, of, these, families, often, called, okies, because, many, of, them, came, from, oklahoma, migrated, to, california, and, other, states, to, find, that, the, great, depression, had, rendered, economic, conditions, there, little, better, than, those, they, had, left, the, combined, effects, of, world, war, i, and, the, disruption, of, the, russian, revolution, which, decreased, the, supply, of, wheat, and, other, commodity, crops, increased, agricultural, prices, this, demand, encouraged, farmers, to, dramatically, increase, cultivation, for, example, in, the, llano, estacado, of, eastern, new, mexico, and, northwestern, texas, the, area, of, farmland, doubled, between, 1900, and, 1920, then, tripled, between, 1925, and, 1930, the, agricultural, methods, farmers, favored, during, this, period, created, the, conditions, for, large, scale, erosion, under, certain, environmental, conditions, the, widespread, conversion, of, the, land, by, deep, plowing, and, other, soil, preparation, methods, to, enable, agriculture, eliminated, the, native, grasses, that, held, the, soil, in, place, and, helped, retain, moisture, during, dry, periods, furthermore, cotton, farmers, left, fields, bare, during, the, winter, when, winds, in, the, high, plains, are, highest, and, burned, the, stubble, as, a, means, to, control, weeds, before, planting, thereby, depriving, the, soil, of, organic, nutrients, and, surface, vegetation, after, fairly, favorable, climatic, conditions, in, the, 1920s, with, good, rainfall, and, relatively, moderate, winters, which, permitted, increased, settlement, and, cultivation, in, the, great, plains, the, region, entered, an, unusually, dry, era, in, the, summer, of, 1930, during, the, next, decade, the, northern, plains, suffered, four, of, their, seven, driest, calendar, years, since, 1895, kansas, four, of, its, 12, driest, and, the, entire, region, south, to, west, texas, lacked, any, period, of, above, normal, rainfall, until, record, rains, hit, in, 1941, when, severe, drought, struck, the, great, plains, region, in, the, 1930s, it, resulted, in, erosion, and, loss, of, topsoil, because, of, farming, practices, at, the, time, the, drought, dried, the, topsoil, and, over, time, it, became, friable, reduced, to, a, powdery, consistency, in, some, places, without, indigenous, grasses, in, place, the, plains, high, winds, picked, up, the, topsoil, and, created, massive, dust, storms, the, persistent, dry, weather, caused, crops, to, fail, leaving, the, plowed, fields, exposed, to, wind, erosion, the, great, plains, fine, soil, eroded, easily, and, was, carried, east, by, strong, continental, winds, on, november, 11, 1933, a, very, strong, dust, storm, stripped, topsoil, from, desiccated, south, dakota, farmlands, in, one, of, a, series, of, severe, dust, storms, that, year, beginning, on, may, 9, 1934, a, strong, two, day, dust, storm, removed, massive, amounts, of, great, plains, topsoil, in, one, of, the, worst, such, storms, of, the, dust, bowl, the, dust, clouds, blew, all, the, way, to, chicago, where, they, deposited, 12, million, pounds, 5, 400, tonnes, of, dust, two, days, later, the, same, storm, reached, cities, to, the, east, such, as, cleveland, buffalo, boston, new, york, city, and, washington, d, c, monuments, like, the, statue, of, liberty, and, the, united, states, capitol, were, blotted, out, dust, worked, its, way, into, even, the, most, sealed, homes, leaving, a, coating, on, food, skin, and, furniture, that, winter, 1934, 35, red, snow, fell, on, new, england, on, april, 14, 1935, known, as, black, sunday, 20, of, the, worst, black, blizzards, occurred, across, the, entire, sweep, of, the, great, plains, from, canada, south, to, texas, the, storms, caused, extensive, damage, and, appeared, to, turn, day, to, night, witnesses, reported, that, they, could, not, see, five, feet, 1, 5, m, in, front, of, them, at, certain, points, denver, based, associated, press, reporter, robert, e, geiger, happened, to, be, in, boise, city, oklahoma, that, day, his, story, about, black, sunday, marked, the, first, appearance, of, the, term, dust, bowl, it, was, coined, by, edward, stanley, kansas, city, news, editor, of, the, associated, press, while, rewriting, geiger, s, news, story, spearman, and, hansford, county, have, been, literaly, in, a, cloud, of, dust, for, the, past, week, ever, since, friday, of, last, week, there, hasn, t, been, a, day, pass, but, what, the, county, was, beseieged, with, a, blast, of, wind, and, dirt, on, rare, occasions, when, the, wind, did, subside, for, a, period, of, hours, the, air, has, been, so, filled, with, dust, that, the, town, appeared, to, be, overhung, by, a, fog, cloud, because, of, this, long, seige, of, dust, and, every, building, being, filled, with, it, the, air, has, become, stifling, to, breathe, and, many, people, have, developed, sore, throats, and, dust, colds, as, a, result, much, of, the, farmland, was, eroded, in, the, aftermath, of, the, dust, bowl, in, 1941, a, kansas, agricultural, experiment, station, released, a, bulletin, that, suggested, reestablishing, native, grasses, by, the, hay, method, developed, in, 1937, to, speed, up, the, process, and, increase, returns, from, pasture, the, hay, method, was, originally, supposed, to, occur, in, kansas, naturally, over, 25, 40, years, after, much, data, analysis, the, causal, mechanism, for, the, droughts, can, be, linked, to, ocean, temperature, anomalies, specifically, atlantic, ocean, sea, surface, temperatures, appear, to, have, had, an, indirect, effect, on, the, general, atmospheric, circulation, while, pacific, sea, surface, temperatures, seem, to, have, had, the, most, direct, influence, this, catastrophe, intensified, the, economic, impact, of, the, great, depression, in, the, region, in, 1935, many, families, were, forced, to, leave, their, farms, and, travel, to, other, areas, seeking, work, because, of, the, drought, which, had, already, lasted, four, years, the, abandonment, of, homesteads, and, financial, ruin, resulting, from, catastrophic, topsoil, loss, led, to, widespread, hunger, and, poverty, dust, bowl, conditions, fomented, an, exodus, of, the, displaced, from, the, texas, panhandle, oklahoma, panhandle, and, the, surrounding, great, plains, to, adjacent, regions, more, than, 500, 000, americans, were, left, homeless, more, than, 350, houses, had, to, be, torn, down, after, one, storm, alone, the, severe, drought, and, dust, storms, left, many, homeless, others, had, their, mortgages, foreclosed, by, banks, or, felt, they, had, no, choice, but, to, abandon, their, farms, in, search, of, work, many, americans, migrated, west, looking, for, work, parents, packed, up, jalopies, with, their, families, and, a, few, personal, belongings, and, headed, west, some, residents, of, the, plains, especially, kansas, and, oklahoma, fell, ill, and, died, of, dust, pneumonia, or, malnutrition, between, 1930, and, 1940, about, 3, 5, million, people, moved, out, of, the, plains, states, in, just, over, a, year, over, 86, 000, people, migrated, to, california, this, number, is, more, than, the, number, of, migrants, to, that, area, during, the, 1849, gold, rush, migrants, abandoned, farms, in, oklahoma, arkansas, missouri, iowa, nebraska, kansas, texas, colorado, and, new, mexico, but, were, often, generally, called, okies, arkies, or, texies, terms, such, as, okies, and, arkies, came, to, be, standard, in, the, 1930s, for, those, who, had, lost, everything, and, were, struggling, the, most, during, the, great, depression, but, not, all, migrants, traveled, long, distances, most, participated, in, internal, state, migration, moving, from, counties, that, the, dust, bowl, badly, impacted, to, other, less, affected, counties, so, many, families, left, their, farms, and, were, on, the, move, that, the, proportion, of, migrants, and, residents, was, nearly, equal, in, the, great, plains, states, an, examination, of, census, bureau, statistics, and, other, records, and, a, 1939, survey, of, occupation, by, the, bureau, of, agricultural, economics, of, about, 116, 000, families, who, arrived, in, california, in, the, 1930s, showed, that, only, 43, of, southwesterners, were, doing, farm, work, immediately, before, they, migrated, nearly, a, third, of, all, migrants, were, professional, or, white, collar, workers, some, farmers, had, to, take, on, unskilled, labor, when, they, moved, leaving, the, farming, sector, commonly, led, to, greater, social, mobility, as, there, was, a, far, greater, likelihood, that, migrant, farmers, would, later, go, into, semi, skilled, or, high, skilled, fields, that, paid, better, non, farmers, experienced, more, downward, occupational, moves, than, farmers, but, in, most, cases, they, were, not, significant, enough, to, bring, them, into, poverty, because, high, skilled, migrants, were, most, likely, to, experience, a, downward, shift, into, semi, skilled, work, while, semi, skilled, work, did, not, pay, as, well, as, high, skilled, work, most, of, these, workers, were, not, impoverished, for, the, most, part, by, the, end, of, the, dust, bowl, the, migrants, generally, were, better, off, than, those, who, chose, to, stay, behind, after, the, great, depression, ended, some, migrants, moved, back, to, their, original, states, many, others, remained, where, they, had, resettled, about, one, eighth, of, california, s, population, is, of, okie, heritage, government, s, greatly, expanded, participation, in, land, management, and, soil, conservation, was, an, important, result, of, the, disaster, different, groups, took, many, different, approaches, to, responding, to, the, disaster, to, identify, areas, that, needed, attention, groups, such, as, the, soil, conservation, service, generated, detailed, soil, maps, and, took, photos, of, the, land, from, the, sky, to, create, shelterbelts, to, reduce, soil, erosion, groups, such, as, the, united, states, forest, service, s, prairie, states, forestry, project, planted, trees, on, private, lands, groups, like, the, resettlement, administration, which, later, became, the, farm, security, administration, encouraged, small, farm, owners, to, resettle, on, other, lands, if, they, lived, in, drier, parts, of, the, plains, during, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, s, first, 100, days, in, office, in, 1933, his, administration, quickly, initiated, programs, to, conserve, soil, and, restore, the, nation, s, ecological, balance, interior, secretary, harold, l, ickes, established, the, soil, erosion, service, in, august, 1933, under, hugh, hammond, bennett, in, 1935, it, was, transferred, and, reorganized, under, the, department, of, agriculture, and, renamed, the, soil, conservation, service, it, is, now, known, as, the, natural, resources, conservation, service, nrcs, as, part, of, new, deal, programs, congress, passed, the, soil, conservation, and, domestic, allotment, act, in, 1936, requiring, landowners, to, share, the, allocated, government, subsidies, with, the, laborers, who, worked, on, their, farms, under, the, law, benefit, payments, were, continued, as, measures, for, production, control, and, income, support, but, they, were, now, financed, by, direct, congressional, appropriations, and, justified, as, soil, conservation, measures, the, act, shifted, the, parity, goal, from, price, equality, of, agricultural, commodities, and, the, articles, that, farmers, buy, to, income, equality, of, farm, and, non, farm, population, thus, the, parity, goal, was, to, re, create, the, ratio, between, the, purchasing, power, of, the, net, income, per, person, on, farms, from, agriculture, and, that, of, the, income, of, persons, not, on, farms, that, prevailed, during, 1909, 1914, to, stabilize, prices, the, government, paid, farmers, and, ordered, more, than, six, million, pigs, to, be, slaughtered, as, part, of, the, agricultural, adjustment, act, aaa, it, paid, to, have, the, meat, packed, and, distributed, to, the, poor, and, hungry, the, federal, surplus, relief, corporation, fsrc, was, established, to, regulate, crop, and, other, surpluses, in, a, may, 14, 1935, address, to, the, aaa, roosevelt, said, let, me, make, one, other, point, clear, for, the, benefit, of, the, millions, in, cities, who, have, to, buy, meats, last, year, the, nation, suffered, a, drought, of, unparalleled, intensity, if, there, had, been, no, government, program, if, the, old, order, had, obtained, in, 1933, and, 1934, that, drought, on, the, cattle, ranges, of, america, and, in, the, corn, belt, would, have, resulted, in, the, marketing, of, thin, cattle, immature, hogs, and, the, death, of, these, animals, on, the, range, and, on, the, farm, and, if, the, old, order, had, been, in, effect, those, years, we, would, have, had, a, vastly, greater, shortage, than, we, face, today, our, program, we, can, prove, it, saved, the, lives, of, millions, of, head, of, livestock, they, are, still, on, the, range, and, other, millions, of, heads, are, today, canned, and, ready, for, this, country, to, eat, the, fsrc, diverted, agricultural, commodities, to, relief, organizations, apples, beans, canned, beef, flour, and, pork, products, were, distributed, through, local, relief, channels, cotton, goods, were, later, included, to, clothe, needy, in, 1935, the, federal, government, formed, a, drought, relief, service, drs, to, coordinate, relief, activities, the, drs, bought, cattle, in, counties, that, were, designated, emergency, areas, for, 14, to, 20, a, head, animals, determined, unfit, for, human, consumption, were, killed, at, the, beginning, of, the, program, more, than, 50, were, so, designated, in, emergency, areas, the, drs, assigned, the, remaining, cattle, to, the, federal, surplus, relief, corporation, fsrc, to, be, used, in, food, distribution, to, families, nationwide, although, it, was, difficult, for, farmers, to, give, up, their, herds, the, cattle, slaughter, program, helped, many, of, them, avoid, bankruptcy, the, government, cattle, buying, program, was, a, blessing, to, many, farmers, as, they, could, not, afford, to, keep, their, cattle, and, the, government, paid, a, better, price, than, they, could, obtain, in, local, markets, roosevelt, ordered, the, civilian, conservation, corps, to, plant, the, great, plains, shelterbelt, a, huge, belt, of, more, than, 200, million, trees, from, canada, to, abilene, texas, to, break, the, wind, hold, water, in, the, soil, and, hold, the, soil, in, place, the, administration, also, began, to, educate, farmers, on, soil, conservation, and, anti, erosion, techniques, including, crop, rotation, strip, farming, contour, plowing, and, terracing, in, 1937, the, federal, government, began, an, aggressive, campaign, to, encourage, dust, bowl, farmers, to, adopt, planting, and, plowing, methods, that, conserved, the, soil, the, government, paid, reluctant, farmers, a, dollar, an, acre, equivalent, to, 21, in, 2023, to, use, the, new, methods, by, 1938, the, massive, conservation, effort, had, reduced, the, amount, of, blowing, soil, by, 65, the, land, still, failed, to, yield, a, decent, living, in, the, fall, of, 1939, after, nearly, a, decade, of, dirt, and, dust, the, drought, ended, when, regular, rainfall, finally, returned, to, the, region, the, government, still, encouraged, continuing, the, use, of, conservation, methods, to, protect, the, plains, soil, and, ecology, at, the, end, of, the, drought, the, programs, implemented, during, the, tough, times, helped, sustain, a, friendly, relationship, between, farmers, and, the, federal, government, the, president, s, drought, committee, issued, a, report, in, 1935, covering, the, government, s, assistance, to, agriculture, during, 1934, through, mid, 1935, it, discussed, conditions, measures, of, relief, organization, finances, operations, and, results, of, the, government, s, assistance, numerous, exhibits, are, included, in, this, report, in, many, regions, more, than, 75, of, the, topsoil, was, blown, away, by, the, end, of, the, 1930s, land, degradation, varied, widely, aside, from, the, short, term, economic, consequences, of, erosion, the, dust, bowl, had, severe, long, term, economic, consequences, by, 1940, counties, that, had, experienced, the, most, erosion, had, a, greater, decline, in, agricultural, land, values, the, per, acre, value, of, farmland, declined, by, 28, in, high, erosion, counties, and, 17, in, medium, erosion, counties, relative, to, land, value, changes, in, low, erosion, counties, 3, even, over, the, long, term, the, land, s, agricultural, value, often, failed, to, return, to, pre, dust, bowl, levels, in, highly, eroded, areas, less, than, 25, of, the, original, agricultural, losses, were, recovered, the, economy, adjusted, predominantly, through, large, relative, population, declines, in, more, eroded, counties, both, during, the, 1930s, and, through, the, 1950s, 1500, the, economic, effects, persisted, in, part, because, of, farmers, failure, to, switch, to, more, appropriate, crops, for, highly, eroded, areas, because, the, amount, of, topsoil, had, been, reduced, it, would, have, been, more, productive, to, shift, from, crops, and, wheat, to, animals, and, hay, during, the, depression, and, through, at, least, the, 1950s, there, was, limited, relative, adjustment, of, farmland, away, from, activities, that, became, less, productive, in, more, eroded, counties, some, of, the, failure, to, shift, to, more, productive, agricultural, products, may, be, related, to, ignorance, about, the, benefits, of, changing, land, use, a, second, explanation, is, a, lack, of, availability, of, credit, caused, by, the, high, rate, of, failure, of, banks, in, the, plains, states, because, banks, failed, in, the, dust, bowl, region, at, a, higher, rate, than, elsewhere, farmers, could, not, get, the, credit, they, needed, to, obtain, capital, to, shift, crop, production, in, addition, profit, margins, in, either, animals, or, hay, were, still, minimal, and, farmers, at, first, had, little, incentive, to, change, their, crops, patrick, allitt, recounts, how, fellow, historian, donald, worster, responded, to, his, return, visit, to, the, dust, bowl, in, the, mid, 1970s, when, he, revisited, some, of, the, worst, afflicted, counties, in, contrast, with, worster, s, pessimism, historian, mathew, bonnifield, argued, that, the, dust, bowl, s, long, term, significance, was, the, triumph, of, the, human, spirit, in, its, capacity, to, endure, and, overcome, hardships, and, reverses, a, 2023, study, in, the, journal, of, economic, history, found, that, while, the, dust, bowl, had, large, and, enduring, impacts, on, agricultural, land, it, had, modest, impacts, on, average, wage, incomes, the, crisis, was, documented, by, photographers, musicians, and, authors, many, hired, during, the, great, depression, by, the, federal, government, for, instance, the, farm, security, administration, hired, photographers, to, document, the, crisis, artists, such, as, dorothea, lange, were, aided, by, having, salaried, work, during, the, depression, she, captured, what, have,
