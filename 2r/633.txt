primary, emphasis, on, its, aesthetic, visual, form, visual, art, can, be, classified, in, diverse, ways, such, as, separating, fine, arts, from, applied, arts, inclusively, focusing, on, human, creativity, or, focusing, on, different, media, such, as, architecture, sculpture, painting, film, photography, and, graphic, arts, in, recent, years, technological, advances, have, led, to, video, art, computer, art, performance, art, animation, television, and, videogames, the, history, of, art, is, often, told, as, a, chronology, of, masterpieces, created, during, each, civilization, it, can, thus, be, framed, as, a, story, of, high, culture, epitomized, by, the, wonders, of, the, world, on, the, other, hand, vernacular, art, expressions, can, also, be, integrated, into, art, historical, narratives, referred, to, as, folk, arts, or, craft, the, more, closely, that, an, art, historian, engages, with, these, latter, forms, of, low, culture, the, more, likely, it, is, that, they, will, identify, their, work, as, examining, visual, culture, or, material, culture, or, as, contributing, to, fields, related, to, art, history, such, as, anthropology, or, archaeology, in, the, latter, cases, art, objects, may, be, referred, to, as, archeological, artifacts, prehistoric, art, includes, a, broad, range, of, art, made, by, painters, and, sculptors, from, illiterate, cultures,

comparable, in, some, ways, with, those, cultures, its, sites, span, an, area, stretching, from, today, s, northeast, afghanistan, through, much, of, pakistan, and, into, western, and, northwestern, india, major, cities, of, the, culture, include, harappa, and, mohenjo, daro, located, respectively, in, punjab, and, in, sindh, province, in, northern, pakistan, and, the, port, city, lothal, in,

objects, produced, in, china, were, made, almost, 4000, years, ago, during, the, xia, dynasty, c, 2100, 1700, bc, during, the, chinese, bronze, age, the, shang, and, zhou, dynasties, court, intercessions, and, communication, with, the, spirit, world, were, conducted, by, a, shaman, possibly, the, king, himself, in, the, shang, dynasty, c, 1600, 1050, bc, the, supreme, deity, was, shangdi, but, aristocratic, families, preferred, to, contact, the, spirits, of, their, ancestors, they, prepared, elaborate, banquets, of, food, and, drink, for, them, heated, and, served, in, bronze, ritual, vessels, these, bronze, vessels, had, many, shapes, depending, on, their, purpose, for, wine, water, cereals, or, meat, and, some, of, them, were, marked, with, readable, characters, which, shows, the, development, of, writing, this, kind, of, vessels, of, a, very, high, quality, and, complexity, were, discovered, on, the, valley, of, the, yellow, river, in, the, henan, province, in, sites, like, erlitou, anyang, or, zhengzhou, they, were, used, in, religious, rituals, to, cement, the, dhang, authority, and, when, the, shang, capital, fell, around, 1050, bc, its, conquerors, the, zhou, c, 1050, 156, bc, continued, to, use, these, containers, in, religious, rituals, but, principally, for, food, rather, than, drink, the, shang, court, had, been, accused, of, excessive, drunkenness, and, the, zhou, promoting, the, imperial, tian, heaven, as, the, prime, spiritual, force, rather, than, ancestors, limited, wine, in, religious, rites, in, favour, of, food, the, use, of,

mirror, image, halves, with, nostrils, eyes, eyebrows, jaws, cheeks, and, horns, surrounded, by, incised, patterns, whether, taotie, represented, real, mythological, or, wholly, imaginary, creatures, cannot, be, determined, the, enigmatic, bronzes, of, sanxingdui, near, guanghan, in, sichuan, province, are, evidence, for, a, mysterious, sacrificial, religious, system, unlike, anything, elsewhere, in, ancient, china, and, quite, different, from, the, art, of, the, contemporaneous, shang, at, anyang, excavations, at, sanxingdui, since, 1986, have, revealed, four, pits, containing, artefacts, of, bronze, jade, and, gold, there, was, found, a, great, bronze, statue, of, a, human, figure, which, stands, on, a, plinth, decorated, with, abstract, elephant, heads, besides, the, standing, figure,

the, zhou, dynasty, 1050, 221, bc, ruled, more, than, any, other, one, from, chinese, history, its, last, centuries, were, characterized, by, violence, the, era, being, known, as, the, warring, states, period, during, this, troubling, time, some, philosophical, movements, appeared, confucianism, daoism, and, legalism, the, warring, states, period, was, ended, by, qinshi, huangdi, who, united, china, in, 221, bc, he, ordered, a, huge, tomb, guarded, by, the, terracotta, army, another, huge, project, was, a, predecessor, of, the, great, wall, erected, for, rejecting, pillaging, tribes, from, the, north, after, the, death, of, the, emperor, his, dynasty, the, qin, 221, 206, bc, lasted, only, three, years, qinshi, huangdi, was, followed, by, the, han, dynasty, 202, bc, 220, ad, during, which, the, silk, road, developed, considerably, bringing, new, cultural, influences, in, china, through, harmonious, proportion, and, a, focus, on, aesthetics, ancient, greek, and, roman, art, became, the, foundation, and, inspiration, of, all, western, art, being, the, standard, to, which, most, european, artists, aspired, until, the, 19th, century, the, latin, poet, horace, writing, in, the, age, of, roman, emperor, augustus, 1st, century, bc, to, 1st, century, ad, famously, remarked, that, although, conquered, on, the, battlefield, captive, greece, overcame, its, savage, conqueror, and, brought, the, arts, to, rustic, rome, the, power, of, greek, art, lies, in, its, representation, of, the, human, figure, and, its, focus, on, human, beings, and, the, anthropomorphic, gods, as, chief, subjects, the, artworks, of, the, greeks, were, meant, to, decorate, temples, and, public, buildings, to, celebrate, battle, victories, and, remarkable, personalities, and, to, commemorate, the, dead, they, were, also, given, as, offerings, to, the, gods, although, there, was, no, definitive, transition, the, art, is, usually, divided, stylistically, into, the, four, periods, of, geometric, archaic, classical, and, hellenistic, during, the, classical, period, 5th, and, 4th, centuries, bc, realism, and, idealism, were, delicately, balanced, in, comparison, the, works, of, the, earlier, geometric, 9th, to, 8th, centuries, bc, and, archaic, 7th, to, 6th, centuries, bc, ages, can, seem, appear, primitive, but, these, artists, had, different, goals, naturalistic, representation, was, not, necessarily, their, aim, greek, and, artists, built, on, the, artistic, foundations, of, egypt, further, developing, the, arts, of, sculpture, painting, architecture, and, ceramics, among, the, techniques, they, perfected, include, methods, of, carving, and, casting, sculptures, fresco, painting, and, building, magnificent, buildings, roman, art, lovers, collected, ancient, greek, originals, roman, replicas, of, greek, art, or, newly, created, paintings, and, sculptures, fashioned, in, a, variety, of, greek, styles, thus, preserving, for, posterity, works, of, art, otherwise, lost, wall, and, panel, paintings, sculptures, and, mosaics, decorated, public, spaces, and, private, homes, greek, imagery, also, appeared, on, roman, jewellery, vessels, of, gold, silver, bronze, and, terracotta, and, even, on, weapons, and, commercial, weights, rediscovered, during, the, early, renaissance, the, arts, of, ancient, greece, transmitted, through, the, roman, empire, have, served, as, the, foundation, of, western, art, until, the, 19th, century, since, the, advent, of, the, classical, age, in, athens, in, the, 5th, century, bc, the, classical, way, of, building, has, been, deeply, woven, into, western, understanding, of, architecture, and, indeed, of, civilization, itself, from, circa, 850, bc, to, circa, 300, ad, ancient, greek, culture, flourished, on, the, greek, mainland, on, the, peloponnese, and, on, the, aegean, islands, five, of, the, wonders, of, the, world, were, greek, the, temple, of, artemis, at, ephesus, the, statue, of, zeus, at, olympia, the, mausoleum, at, halicarnassus, the, colossus, of, rhodes, and, the, lighthouse, of, alexandria, however, ancient, greek, architecture, is, best, known, for, its, temples, many, of, which, are, found, throughout, the, region, and, the, parthenon, is, a, prime, example, of, this, later, they, will, serve, as, inspiration, for, neoclassical, architects, during, the, late, 18th, and, the, 19th, century, the, most, well, known, temples, are, the, parthenon, and, the, erechtheion, both, on, the, acropolis, of, athens, another, type, of, important, ancient, greek, buildings, were, the, theatres, both, temples, and, theatres, used, a, complex, mix, of, optical, illusions, and, balanced, ratios, looking, at, the, archaeological, remains, of, ancient, buildings, it, is, easy, to, perceive, them, as, limestone, and, concrete, in, a, grey, taupe, tone, and, to, make, the, assumption, that, ancient, buildings, were, monochromatic, however, architecture, was, polychromed, in, much, of, the, ancient, world, one, of, the, most, iconic, ancient, buildings, the, parthenon, c, 447, 432, bc, in, athens, had, details, painted, with, vibrant, reds, blues, and, greens, besides, ancient, temples, medieval, cathedrals, were, never, completely, white, most, had, colored, highlights, on, capitals, and, columns, this, practice, of, coloring, buildings, and, artworks, was, abandoned, during, the, early, renaissance, this, is, because, leonardo, da, vinci, and, other, renaissance, artists, including, michelangelo, promoted, a, color, palette, inspired, by, the, ancient, greco, roman, ruins, which, because, of, neglect, and, constant, decay, during, the, middle, ages, became, white, despite, being, initially, colorful, the, pigments, used, in, the, ancient, world, were, delicate, and, especially, susceptible, to, weathering, without, necessary, care, the, colors, exposed, to, rain, snow, dirt, and, other, factors, vanished, over, time, and, this, way, ancient, buildings, and, artworks, became, white, like, they, are, today, and, were, during, the, renaissance, no, civilization, has, had, an, impact, as, enduring, and, powerful, on, western, art, as, the, roman, empire, the, legacy, of, ancient, rome, is, evident, through, the, medieval, and, early, modern, periods, and, roman, art, continue, to, be, reused, in, the, modern, era, in, both, traditionalist, and, postmodern, artworks, sometimes, it, is, viewed, as, derived, from, greek, precedents, but, also, has, its, own, distinguishing, features, some, of, them, inherited, from, etruscan, art, roman, sculpture, is, often, less, idealized, than, its, greek, precedents, being, very, realistic, roman, architecture, often, used, concrete, and, features, such, as, the, round, arch, and, dome, were, invented, luxury, objects, in, metal, work, gem, engraving, ivory, carvings, and, glass, are, sometimes, considered, in, modern, terms, to, be, minor, forms, of, roman, art, although, this, would, not, necessarily, have, been, the, case, for, contemporaries, an, innovation, made, possible, by, the, roman, development, of, glass, blowing, was, cameo, glass, a, white, shell, was, first, created, into, which, coloured, glass, was, then, blown, so, as, to, produce, an, interior, lining, the, white, shell, was, then, cut, down, to, create, relief, patterns, of, white, against, a, darker, background, they, also, made, mosaics, this, way, producing, durable, pictorial, art, with, cut, stone, cubes, tesserae, and, or, chips, of, coloured, terracotta, and, glass, some, villas, of, wealthy, romans, had, their, walls, covered, with, frescos, aimed, at, dazziling, and, entertaining, guests, much, of, roman, wall, painting, that, survives, comes, from, sites, around, the, bay, of, naples, in, particular, pompeii, and, herculaneum, thriving, towns, that, were, preserved, under, metres, of, volcanic, debris, when, mount, vesuvius, erupted, in, 79, ad, as, a, result, roman, wall, painting, is, often, discussed, in, terms, of, four, pompeian, styles, the, romans, were, deeply, influenced, by, all, aspects, of, hellenistic, culture, in, architecture, just, like, in, other, art, media, they, essentially, adopted, the, classical, language, and, adapted, it, to, new, situations, and, uses, the, romans, also, have, their, own, innovations, brought, to, classical, architecture, they, used, the, doric, ionic, and, corinthian, orders, in, a, far, freer, manner, than, the, greeks, had, creating, their, own, version, of, the, doric, and, using, the, corinthian, far, more, frequently, they, also, added, two, new, orders, to, the, repertoire, the, tuscan, a, simpler, more, massive, version, of, the, doric, derived, from, etruscan, architecture, and, the, composite, a, combination, of, the, scroll, like, volutes, of, the, ionic, with, the, corinthian, s, acanthus, leaves, other, important, innovations, include, the, arch, and, the, dome, using, arches, they, built, aqueducts, and, monumental, triumphal, arches, roman, emperors, were, proud, of, their, conquests, and, commemorated, them, at, home, and, in, the, conquered, territories, through, triumphal, arches, a, good, example, of, this, being, the, arch, of, constantine, in, rome, between, 30, and, 15, bc, the, architect, and, civil, and, military, engineer, marcus, vitruvius, pollio, published, a, majore, treatise, de, architectura, which, influenced, architects, around, the, world, for, centuries, after, the, middle, ages, with, the, renaissance, that, started, in, florence, italy, a, growing, interest, for, ancient, rome, started, during, it, for, the, first, time, since, classical, antiquity, art, became, convincingly, lifelike, the, renaissance, also, sparked, interest, for, ancient, greek, and, roman, literature, not, just, for, art, and, architecture, islamic, art, is, well, known, since, the, middle, ages, for, the, use, of, elaborate, geometric, patterns, colourful, tiles, stylized, natural, motifs, and, detailed, calligraphy, rarely, has, lettering, had, such, a, profound, impact, on, applied, arts, and, architecture, islam, appeared, in, western, arabia, in, the, 7th, century, ad, through, revelations, delivered, to, the, prophet, muhammad, in, mecca, within, a, century, of, muhammad, s, death, the, islamic, empires, controlled, the, middle, east, spain, and, parts, of, asia, and, africa, because, of, this, similarly, with, roman, art, islamic, art, and, architecture, had, regional, versions, as, the, islamic, world, extended, into, centres, of, late, antique, culture, it, was, enriched, by, philosophical, and, intellectual, movements, the, translation, of, greek, works, into, arabic, and, advances, in, mathematics, and, science, were, encouraged, by, early, caliphates, this, is, in, contrast, with, the, modern, perception, that, islamic, art, is, dogmatic, and, unchanging, human, and, animal, representation, wasn, t, rare, only, certain, periods, restricted, it, similar, with, the, byzantine, iconoclasm, some, of, the, first, great, civilizations, in, the, americas, developed, in, mesoamerica, meaning, middle, americas, the, most, well, known, being, the, mayans, and, the, aztecs, the, olmecs, c, 1400, 400, bc, were, the, first, major, civilization, in, modern, day, mexico, many, elements, of, mesoamerican, civilizations, like, the, practice, of, building, of, pyramids, the, complex, calendar, the, pantheon, of, gods, and, hieroglyphic, writing, have, origins, in, olmec, culture, they, produced, jade, and, ceramic, figurines, colossal, heads, and, pyramids, with, temples, at, the, top, all, without, the, advantage, of, metal, tools, for, them, jadeite, was, a, stone, more, precious, than, gold, and, symbolized, divine, powers, and, fertility, 17, olmec, colossal, heads, have, been, discovered, each, weighing, a, few, tons, each, head, with, the, flattened, nose, and, thick, lips, wears, a, helmet, similar, with, the, ones, worn, during, official, ball, games, possibly, representing, kings, of, officials, the, maya, civilization, began, around, 1800, bc, and, grew, until, the, arrival, of, spanish, colonizers, in, the, 1500s, they, occupied, southeast, mexico, guatemala, belize, and, parts, of, honduras, and, el, salvador, the, mayans, were, trading, with,

that, did, not, inhabit, mesoamerican, territories, like, the, ta, no, from, the, caribbean, they, produced, impressive, king, portraits, polychrome, ceramic, vessels, earthenware, figures, wooden, sculptures, stelas, and, built, complex, cities, with, pyramids, most, of, the, well, preserved, polychrome, ceramic, vessels, were, discovered, in, the, tombs, of, nobles, arising, from, humble, beginnings, as, a, nomadic, group, the, aztecs, created, the, largest, empire, in, mesoamerican, history, lasting, from, 1427, to, 1521, they, did, not, call, themselves, aztecs, but, mexica, the, term, aztecs, was, assigned, by, historians, they, transformed, the, capital, of, their, empire, tenochtitlan, into, a, place, where, artists, of, mesoamerica, created, impressive, artworks, for, their, new, masters, the, present, day, mexico, city, was, built, over, the, aztec, capital, tenochtitlan, similarly, with, mesoamerica, the, present, day, territory, of, colombia, is, an, area, where, multiple, cultures, developed, before, the, arrival, of, spanish, colonizers, here, gold, body, accessories, were, produced, many, golden, ones, but, also, many, other, ones, made, of, tumbaga,

america, and, south, america, the, ancient, civilizations, of, peru, and, bolivia, nurtured, unique, artistic, traditions, including, one, of, the, world, s, most, aesthetically, impressive, fibre, art, traditions, two, of, the, first, important, cultures, from, this, land, are, the, chav, n, and, the, paracas, culture, the, paracas, culture, of, the, south, coast, of, peru, is, best, known, for, its, complex, patterned, textiles, particularly, mantels, the, moche, controlled, the, river, valleys, of, the, north, coast, while, the, nazca, of, southern, peru, held, sway, along, the, coastal, deserts, and, contiguous, mountains, the, nazca, are, best, known, for, the, famous, nazca, lines, a, group, of, geoglyphs, in, a, desert, in, southern, peru, they, also, produced, polychrome, ceramics, and, textiles, influenced, by, the, paracas, and, used, a, palette, of, at, least, 10, colours, for, their, pottery, both, cultures, flourished, around, 100, 800, ad, moche, pottery, is, some, of, the, most, varied, in, the, world, in, the, north, the, wari, or, huari, empire, are, noted, for, their, stone, architecture, and, sculpture, accomplishments, the, chim, were, preceded, by, a, simple, ceramic, style, known, as, sic, n, 700, 900, ad, the, chim, produced, excellent, portrait, and, decorative, works, in, metal, notably, gold, but, especially, silver, later, the, inca, empire, 1100, 1533, stretched, across, the, andes, mountains, they, crafted, precious, metal, figurines, and, like, other, civilizations, from, the, same, area, complex, textiles, llamas, were, important, animals, because, of, their, wool, and, for, carrying, loads, eastern, civilization, broadly, includes, asia, and, it, also, includes, a, complex, tradition, of, art, making, one, approach, to, eastern, art, history, divides, the, field, by, nation, with, foci, on, indian, art, chinese, art, and, japanese, art, due, to, the, size, of, the, continent, the, distinction, between, eastern, asia, and, southern, asia, in, the, context, of, arts, can, be, clearly, seen, in, most, of, asia, pottery, was, a, prevalent, form, of, art, the, pottery, is, often, decorated, with, geometric, patterns, or, abstract, representations, of, animals, people, or, plants, other, very, widespread, forms, of, art, were, and, are, sculpture, and, painting, central, asian, art, developed, in, central, asia, in, areas, corresponding, to, modern, kyrgyzstan, kazakhstan, uzbekistan, turkmenistan, azerbaijan, tajikistan, afghanistan, pakistan, and, parts, of, modern, mongolia, china, and, russia, the, art, of, ancient, and, medieval, central, asia, reflects, the, rich, history, of, this, vast, area, home, to, a, huge, variety, of, peoples, religions, and, ways, of, life, the, artistic, remains, of, the, region, show, a, remarkable, combinations, of, influences, that, exemplify, the, multicultural, nature, of, central, asian, society, the, silk, road, transmission, of, art, scythian, art, greco, buddhist, art, serindian, art, and, more, recently, persianate, culture, are, all, part, of, this, complicated, history, central, asia, has, always, been, a, crossroads, of, cultural, exchange, the, hub, of, the, so, called, silk, road, that, complex, system, of, trade, routes, stretching, from, china, to, the, mediterranean, already, in, the, bronze, age, 3rd, and, 2nd, millennium, bc, growing, settlements, formed, part, of, an, extensive, network, of, trade, linking, central, asia, to, the, indus, valley, mesopotamia, and, egypt, early, buddhists, in, india, developed, symbols, related, to, buddha, the, major, survivals, of, buddhist, art, begin, in, the, period, after, the, mauryans, within, north, india, kushan, art, the, greco, buddhist, art, of, gandhara, and, finally, the, classic, period, of, gupta, art, additionally, there, was, the, andhra, school, which, appeared, before, the, gandhara, school, and, which, was, based, in, south, india, good, quantities, of, sculpture, survives, from, some, key, sites, such, as, sanchi, bharhut, and, amaravati, some, of, which, remain, in, situ, with, others, in, museums, in, india, or, around, the, world, stupas, were, surrounded, by, ceremonial, fences, with, four, profusely, carved, toranas, or, ornamental, gateways, facing, the, cardinal, directions, these, are, in, stone, though, clearly, adopting, forms, developed, in, wood, they, and, the, walls, of, the, stupa, itself, can, be, heavily, decorated, with, reliefs, mostly, illustrating, the, lives, of, the, buddha, gradually, life, size, figures, were, sculpted, initially, in, deep, relief, but, then, free, standing, mathura, art, was, the, most, important, centre, in, this, development, which, applied, to, hindu, and, jain, art, as, well, as, buddhist, the, facades, and, interiors, of, rock, cut, chaitya, prayer, halls, and, monastic, viharas, have, survived, better, than, similar, free, standing, structures, elsewhere, which, were, for, long, mostly, in, wood, the, caves, at, ajanta, karle, bhaja, and, elsewhere, contain, early, sculpture, often, outnumbered, by, later, works, such, as, iconic, figures, of, the, buddha, and, bodhisattvas, which, are, not, found, before, 100, ad, at, the, least, in, eastern, asia, painting, was, derived, from, the, practice, of, calligraphy, and, portraits, and, landscapes, were, painted, on, silk, cloth, most, of, the, paintings, represent, landscapes, or, portraits, the, most, spectacular, sculptures, are, the, ritual, bronzes, and, the, bronze, sculptures, from, sanxingdui, a, very, well, known, example, of, chinese, art, is, the, terracotta, army, depicting, the, armies, of, qin, shi, huang, the, first, emperor, of, china, it, is, a, form, of, funerary, art, buried, with, the, emperor, in, 210, 209, bc, whose, purpose, was, to, protect, the, emperor, in, his, afterlife, chinese, art, is, one, of, the, oldest, continuous, traditional, arts, in, the, world, and, is, marked, by, an, unusual, degree, of, continuity, within, and, consciousness, of, that, tradition, lacking, an, equivalent, to, the, western, collapse, and, gradual, recovery, of, classical, styles, the, media, that, have, usually, been, classified, in, the, west, since, the, renaissance, as, the, decorative, arts, are, extremely, important, in, chinese, art, and, much, of, the, finest, work, was, produced, in, large, workshops, or, factories, by, essentially, unknown, artists, especially, in, chinese, ceramics, the, range, and, quality, of, goods, that, decorated, chinese, palaces,

invasions, of, new, ideas, followed, by, long, periods, of, minimal, contact, with, the, outside, world, over, time, the, japanese, developed, the, ability, to, absorb, imitate, and, finally, assimilate, those, elements, of, foreign, culture, that, complemented, their, aesthetic, preferences, the, earliest, complex, art, in, japan, was, produced, in, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, in, connection, with, buddhism, in, the, 9th, century, as, the, japanese, began, to, turn, away, from, china, and, develop, indigenous, forms, of, expression, the, secular, arts, became, increasingly, important, until, the, late, 15th, century, both, religious, and, secular, arts, flourished, after, the, nin, war, 1467, 1477, japan, entered, a, period, of, political, social, and, economic, disruption, that, lasted, for, over, a, century, in, the, state, that, emerged, under, the, leadership, of, the, tokugawa, shogunate, organized, religion, played, a, much, less, important, role, in, people, s, lives, and, the, arts, that, survived, were, primarily, secular, sub, saharan, african, art, includes, both, sculpture, typified, by, the, brass, castings, of, the, benin, people, igbo, ukwu, and, the, kingdom, of, if, and, terracottas, of, djenne, jeno, ife, and, the, more, ancient, nok, culture, as, well, as, folk, art, concurrent, with, the, european, middle, ages, in, the, eleventh, century, ad, a, nation, that, made, grand, architecture, gold, sculpture, and, intricate, jewelry, was, founded, in, great, zimbabwe, impressive, sculpture, was, concurrently, being, cast, from, brass, by, the, yoruba, people, of, what, is, now, nigeria, in, the, benin, kingdom, also, of, southern, nigeria, which, began, around, the, same, time, elegant, altar, tusks, brass, heads, plaques, of, brass, and, palatial, architecture, were, created, the, benin, kingdom, was, ended, by, the, british, in, 1897, and, little, of, the, culture, s, art, now, remains, in, nigeria, today, the, most, significant, arts, venue, in, africa, is, the, johannesburg, biennale, sub, saharan, africa, is, characterized, by, a, high, density, of, cultures, notable, are, the, dogon, people, from,

fang, people, from, equatorial, guinea, 85, cameroon, and, gabon, the, sao, civilization, people, from, chad, kwele, people, from, eastern, gabon, republic, of, the, congo, and, cameroon, the, myriad, forms, of, african, art, are, components, of, some, of, the, most, vibrant, and, responsive, artistic, traditions, in, the, world, and, are, integral, to, the, lives, of, african, people, created, for, specific, purposes, artworks, can, reveal, their, ongoing, importance, through, physical, transformations, that, enhance, both, their, appearance, and, their, potency, many, traditional, african, art, forms, are, created, as, conduits, to, the, spirit, world, and, change, appearance, as, materials, are, added, to, enhance, their, beauty, and, potency, the, more, a, work, is, used, and, blessed, the, more, abstract, it, becomes, with, the, accretion, of, sacrificial, matter, and, the, wearing, down, of, original, details, oceanian, art, includes, the, geographic, areas, of, micronesia, polynesia, australia, new, zealand, and, melanesia, one, approach, treats, the, area, thematically, with, foci, on, ancestry, warfare, the, body, gender, trade, religion, and, tourism, unfortunately, little, ancient, art, survives, from, oceania, scholars, believe, that, this, is, likely, because, artists, used, perishable, materials, such, as, wood, and, feathers, which, did, not, survive, in, the, tropical, climate, and, there, are, no, historical, records, to, refer, to, most, of, this, material, the, understanding, of, oceania, s, artistic, cultures, thus, begins, with, the, documentation, of, it, by, westerners, such, as, captain, james, cook, in, the, 18th, century, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, french, artist, paul, gauguin, spent, significant, amounts, of, time, in, tahiti, living, with, local, people, and, making, modern, art, a, fact, that, has, become, intertwined, with, tahitian, visual, culture, to, the, present, day, the, indigenous, art, of, australia, often, looks, like, abstract, modern, art, but, it, has, deep, roots, in, local, culture, the, art, of, oceania, is, the, last, great, tradition, of, art, to, be, appreciated, by, the, world, at, large, despite, being, one, of, the, longest, continuous, traditions, of, art, in, the, world, dating, back, at, least, fifty, millennia, it, remained, relatively, unknown, until, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, often, ephemeral, materials, of, aboriginal, art, of, australia, makes, it, difficult, to, determine, the, antiquity, of, the, majority, of, the, forms, of, art, practised, today, the, most, durable, forms, are, the, multitudes, of, rock, engravings, and, rock, paintings, which, are, found, across, the, continent, in, the, arnhem, land, escarpment, evidence, suggests, that, paintings, were, being, made, fifty, thousand, years, ago, antedating, the, palaeolithic, rock, paintings, of, altamira, lascaux, in, europe, with, the, decline, of, the, roman, empire, from, c, 300, ad, a, period, subsequently, defined, as, the, medieval, era, began, it, lasted, for, about, a, millennium, until, the, beginning, of, the, renaissance, c, 1400, early, christian, art, typifies, the, early, stages, of, this, period, followed, by, byzantine, art, anglo, saxon, art, viking, art, ottonian, art, romanesque, art, and, gothic, art, with, islamic, art, dominating, the, eastern, mediterranean, medieval, art, grew, out, of, the, artistic, heritage, of, the, roman, empire, and, of, byzantium, mixed, with, the, barbarian, artistic, culture, of, northern, europe, in, byzantine, and, gothic, art, of, the, middle, ages, the, dominance, of, the, church, resulted, in, a, large, amount, of, religious, art, there, was, extensive, use, of, gold, in, paintings, which, presented, figures, in, simplified, forms, byzantine, art, consists, of, the, body, of, christian, greek, artistic, products, of, the, eastern, roman, byzantine, empire, as, well, as, of, the, nations, and, states, that, inherited, culturally, from, that, empire, though, the, byzantine, empire, itself, emerged, from, rome, s, decline, and, lasted, until, the, fall, of, constantinople, in, 1453, the, start, date, of, the, byzantine, period, is, rather, clearer, in, art, history, than, in, political, history, if, still, imprecise, many, eastern, orthodox, states, in, eastern, and, central, europe, as, well, as, to, some, degree, the, muslim, states, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, preserved, many, aspects, of, the, empire, s, culture, and, art, for, centuries, afterward, surviving, byzantine, art, is, mostly, religious, and, with, exceptions, at, certain, periods, is, highly, conventionalised, following, traditional, models, that, translate, carefully, controlled, church, theology, into, artistic, terms, painting, in, fresco, in, illuminated, manuscripts, and, on, wood, panels, and, especially, in, earlier, periods, mosaic, were, the, main, media, and, figurative, sculpture, occurred, very, rarely, except, for, small, carved, ivories, manuscript, painting, preserved, to, the, end, some, of, the, classical, realist, tradition, that, was, missing, in, larger, works, byzantine, art, was, highly, prestigious, and, sought, after, in, western, europe, where, it, maintained, a, continuous, influence, on, medieval, art, until, near, the, end, of, the, medieval, period, this, was, especially, so, in, italy, where, byzantine, styles, persisted, in, modified, form, through, the, 12th, century, and, became, formative, influences, on, italian, renaissance, art, but, few, incoming, influences, affected, the, byzantine, style, with, the, expansion, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, byzantine, forms, and, styles, spread, throughout, the, orthodox, world, and, beyond, influences, from, byzantine, architecture, particularly, in, religious, buildings, can, be, found, in, diverse, regions, from, egypt, and, arabia, to, russia, and, romania, byzantine, architecture, is, notorious, for, the, use, of, domes, it, also, often, featured, marble, columns, coffered, ceilings, and, sumptuous, decoration, including, the, extensive, use, of, mosaics, with, golden, backgrounds, the, building, material, used, by, byzantine, architects, was, no, longer, marble, which, the, ancient, greeks, had, appreciated, so, much, the, byzantines, used, mostly, stone, and, brick, and, also, thin, alabaster, sheets, for, windows, mosaics, were, used, to, cover, brick, walls, and, any, other, surface, where, fresco, wouldn, t, resist, good, examples, of, mosaics, from, the, proto, byzantine, era, are, in, hagios, demetrios, in, thessaloniki, greece, the, basilica, of, sant, apollinare, nuovo, and, the, basilica, of, san, vitale, both, in, ravenna, in, italy, and, in, hagia, sophia, in, istanbul, greco, roman, temples, and, byzantine, churches, differ, substantially, in, terms, of, their, exterior, and, interior, aspect, in, antiquity, the, exterior, was, the, most, important, part, of, the, temple, because, in, the, interior, which, contained, the, cult, statue, of, the, deity, to, whom, the, temple, was, built, only, the, priest, had, access, temple, ceremonies, in, antiquity, took, place, outside, and, what, the, worshippers, viewed, was, the, facade, of, the, temple, consisting, of, columns, with, an, entablature, and, two, pediments, but, christian, liturgies, played, out, in, the, interior, of, the, churches, the, exterior, usually, having, little, to, no, ornamentation, ottonian, art, is, a, style, in, pre, romanesque, german, art, covering, also, some, works, from, the, low, countries, northern, italy, and, eastern, france, it, was, named, by, the, art, historian, hubert, janitschek, after, the, ottonian, dynasty, which, ruled, germany, and, northern, italy, between, 919, and, 1024, under, the, kings, henry, i, otto, i, otto, ii, otto, iii, and, henry, ii, with, ottonian, architecture, it, is, a, key, component, of, the, ottonian, renaissance, circa, 951, 1024, however, the, style, neither, began, nor, ended, to, neatly, coincide, with, the, rule, of, the, dynasty, it, emerged, some, decades, into, their, rule, and, persisted, past, the, ottonian, emperors, into, the, reigns, of, the, early, salian, dynasty, which, lacks, an, artistic, style, label, of, its, own, in, the, traditional, scheme, of, art, history, ottonian, art, follows, carolingian, art, and, precedes, romanesque, art, though, the, transitions, at, both, ends, of, the, period, are, gradual, rather, than, sudden, like, the, former, and, unlike, the, latter, it, was, very, largely, a, style, restricted, to, a, few, of, the, small, cities, of, the, period, to, important, monasteries, as, well, as, to, the, court, circles, of, the, emperor, and, his, leading, vassals, after, the, decline, of, the, 9th, century, carolingian, empire, the, holy, roman, empire, was, re, established, under, the, saxon, ottonian, dynasty, from, this, emerged, a, renewed, faith, in, the, idea, of, empire, and, a, reformed, church, creating, a, period, of, heightened, cultural, and, artistic, fervour, in, this, atmosphere, masterpieces, were, created, that, fused, the, traditions, from, which, ottonian, artists, derived, their, inspiration, models, of, late, antique, carolingian, and, byzantine, origin, surviving, ottonian, art, is, very, largely, religious, in, the, form, of, illuminated, manuscripts, and, metalwork, and, was, produced, in, a, small, number, of, centres, for, a, narrow, range, of, patrons, in, the, circle, of, the, imperial, court, as, well, as, for, important, figures, in, the, church, however, much, of, it, was, designed, for, display, to, a, wider, public, especially, to, pilgrims, the, style, is, generally, grand, and, heavy, sometimes, to, excess, and, initially, less, sophisticated, than, the, carolingian, equivalents, with, less, direct, influence, from, byzantine, art, and, less, understanding, of, its, classical, models, but, around, 1000, a, striking, intensity, and, expressiveness, emerge, in, many, works, as, a, solemn, monumentality, is, combined, with, a, vibrant, inwardness, an, unworldly, visionary, quality, with, sharp, attention, to, actuality, surface, patterns, of, flowing, lines, and, rich, bright, colours, with, passionate, emotionalism, the, romanesque, the, first, pan, european, style, to, emerge, after, the, roman, empire, spanned, the, mid, tenth, century, to, the, thirteenth, the, period, saw, a, resurgence, of, monumental, stone, structures, with, complex, structural, programmes, romanesque, churches, are, characterized, by, rigid, articulation, and, geometric, clarity, incorporated, into, a, unified, volumetric, whole, the, architecture, is, austere, but, enlivened, by, decorative, sculpting, of, capitals, and, portals, as, well, as, frescoed, interiors, geometric, and, foliate, patterning, gives, way, to, increasingly, three, dimensional, figurative, sculpture, st, michael, s, church, hildesheim, germany, 1001, 1030, is, seen, by, some, as, a, proto, romanesque, church, from, the, mid, eleventh, to, the, early, thirteenth, centuries, romanesque, paintings, were, two, dimensional, defined, by, bold, linear, outlines, and, geometry, particularly, in, the, handling, of, drapery, painters, emphasised, symmetry, and, frontality, virtually, all, western, churches, were, painted, but, probably, only, a, few, wall, painters, were, monks, instead, itinerant, artists, carried, out, most, of, this, work, basic, blocking, out, was, done, on, wet, plaster, with, earth, colours, a, limited, palette, dominated, by, white, red, yellow, ochres, and, azure, was, employed, for, maximum, visual, effect, with, dense, colouring, forming, a, backdrop, of, bands, a, practice, that, originated, in, late, classical, art, as, an, attempt, to, distinguish, earth, and, sky, during, the, later, eleventh, and, twelfth, centuries, the, great, age, of, western, monasticism, europe, experienced, unprecedented, economic, social, and, political, change, leading, to, burgeoning, wealth, among, landowners, including, monasteries, there, was, increasing, demand, for, books, and, economic, wealth, encouraged, the, production, of, richly, illuminated, manuscripts, one, of, the, outstanding, artefacts, of, the, age, is, the, 70, m, long, bayeux, tapestry, it, depicts, the, events, leading, up, to, the, norman, conquest, of, england, with, protagonists, william, duke, of, normandy, and, harold, earl, of, wessex, later, king, of, england, and, culminating, in, the, battle, of, hastings, of, 1066, it, is, thought, to, date, from, the, 11th, century, it, tells, the, story, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, conquering, normans, but, is, now, agreed, to, have, been, made, in, england, most, likely, by, women, although, the, designer, is, unknown, it, is, housed, in, france, gothic, art, developed, in, northern, france, out, of, romanesque, in, the, 12th, century, ad, and, led, by, the, concurrent, development, of, gothic, architecture, it, spread, to, all, of, western, europe, and, much, of, southern, and, central, europe, never, quite, effacing, more, classical, styles, in, italy, in, the, late, 14th, century, the, sophisticated, court, style, of, international, gothic, developed, which, continued, to, evolve, until, the, late, 15th, century, brick, gothic, was, a, specific, style, of, gothic, architecture, common, in, northeast, and, central, europe, especially, in, the, regions, in, and, around, the, baltic, sea, which, do, not, have, resources, of, standing, rock, the, buildings, are, essentially, built, using, bricks, the, imposing, gothic, cathedrals, with, their, sculptural, programmes, and, stained, glass, windows, epitomize, the, gothic, style, it, differs, from, romanesque, through, its, rib, shaped, vaults, and, the, use, of, ogives, instead, of, the, thick, romanesque, walls, gothic, buildings, are, thin, and, tall, spiral, stairs, in, towers, are, specific, to, gothic, architecture, gothic, painting, much, of, it, executed, in, tempera, and, later, oils, on, panel, as, well, as, fresco, and, with, an, increasingly, broad, palette, of, secondary, colours, is, generally, seen, as, more, naturalistic, than, romanesque, the, humanity, of, religious, narrative, was, highlighted, and, the, emotional, state, of, the, characters, individualized, the, increased, urbanity, of, the, medieval, economy, and, the, rise, of, the, clerical, and, lay, patron, saw, a, change, in, the, nature, of, the, art, market, which, can, be, seen, in, developments, in, gothic, manuscript, illumination, workshops, employed, specialists, for, different, elements, of, the, page, such, as, figures, or, marginal, vine, motifs, encompassing, early, northern, and, high, renaissance, the, term, renaissance, describes, the, rebirth, in, europe, of, a, new, interest, for, classical, antiquity, for, the, first, time, since, antiquity, art, became, convincingly, lifelike, besides, the, ancient, past, renaissance, artists, also, studied, nature, understanding, the, human, body, animals, plants, space, perspective, and, the, qualities, of, light, the, most, common, theme, were, religious, subjects, but, depictions, of, mythological, stories, were, produced, as, well, also, there, was, no, uniform, renaissance, style, each, artist, developed, their, own, distinct, visual, language, influenced, by, their, predecessors, and, contemporaries, the, early, renaissance, was, a, period, of, great, creative, and, intellectual, activity, when, artists, broke, away, completely, from, the, parameters, of, byzantine, art, it, is, generally, accepted, that, it, started, in, florence, in, present, day, italy, in, the, early, 15th, century, it, is, characterized, by, a, surge, of, interest, in, classical, literature, philosophy, and, art, the, growth, of, commerce, the, discovery, of, new, continents, and, new, inventions, there, was, a, revival, of, interest, in, the, art, and, literature, of, ancient, rome, and, the, study, of, ancient, greek, and, latin, texts, instigated, concepts, of, individualism, and, reason, which, became, known, as, humanism, humanists, considered, life, in, the, present, and, emphasized, the, importance, of, individual, thought, which, affected, artists, approaches, despite, being, highly, associated, with, italy, particularly, with, florence, rome, and, venice, the, rest, of, western, europe, participated, to, the, renaissance, as, well, the, northern, renaissance, occurred, in, europe, north, of, the, alps, from, the, early, 15th, century, following, a, period, of, artistic, cross, fertilization, between, north, and, south, known, as, international, gothic, there, was, a, big, difference, between, the, northern, and, italian, renaissance, the, north, artists, did, not, seek, to, revive, the, values, of, ancient, greece, and, rome, like, the, italians, while, in, the, south, italian, artists, and, patrons, were, amazed, by, the, empirical, study, of, nature, and, the, human, society, and, by, the, deep, colors, that, northern, artists, could, achieve, in, the, newly, developed, medium, of, oil, paint, the, protestant, reformation, increased, the, northern, interest, in, secular, painting, like, portraits, or, landscapes, two, key, northern, artists, are, hieronymus, bosch, known, for, his, surreal, paintings, filled, with, hybrid, creatures, like, the, garden, of, earthly, delights, and, albrecht, d, rer, who, brought, the, new, art, of, printmaking, to, a, new, level, the, high, renaissance, took, place, in, the, late, 15th, early, 16th, centuries, and, was, influenced, by, the, fact, that, as, papal, power, stabilized, in, rome, several, popes, commissioned, art, and, architecture, determined, to, recreate, the, city, s, former, glory, raphael, and, michelangelo, produced, vast, and, grandiose, projects, for, the, popes, the, most, famous, artwork, of, this, part, of, the, renaissance, is, probably, the, ceiling, of, the, sistine, chapel, mannerism, broke, away, from, high, renaissance, ideals, of, harmony, and, a, rational, approach, to, art, to, embrace, exaggerated, forms, elongated, proportions, and, more, vibrant, colors, it, developed, in, italy, between, 1510, and, 1520, among, artists, who, prized, originality, above, all, the, name, of, this, movement, comes, from, the, italian, maniera, meaning, style, or, manner, the, word, was, meant, to, describe, the, standard, of, excellence, achieved, during, the, high, renaissance, to, which, all, art, should, now, adhere, but, in, practice, it, led, to, stylization, and, art, to, show, art, sometimes, with, great, success, an, example, being, raphael, s, pupil, giulio, romano, mannerism, has, also, been, used, more, generally, to, describe, a, period, following, the, renaissance, and, preceding, the, baroque, the, 17th, century, was, a, period, of, volatile, change, both, in, science, through, inventions, and, developments, such, as, the, telescope, or, the, microscope, and, in, religion, as, the, catholic, counter, reformation, contested, the, growing, popularity, of, protestant, faith, after, the, protestant, reformation, the, catholic, church, reacted, with, the, counter, reformation, decreeing, that, art, should, inspire, viewers, with, passionate, religious, themes, succeeding, mannerism, and, developing, as, a, result, of, religious, tensions, across, europe, baroque, art, emerged, in, the, late, 16th, century, the, name, may, derive, from, barocco, the, portuguese, word, for, misshaped, pearl, and, it, describes, art, that, combined, emotion, dynamism, and, drama, with, powerful, color, realism, and, strong, tonal, contrasts, between, 1545, and, 1563, at, the, council, of, trent, it, was, decided, that, religious, art, must, encourage, piety, realism, and, accuracy, and, by, attracting, viewers, attention, and, empathy, glorify, the, catholic, church, and, strengthen, the, image, of, catholicism, in, the, next, century, the, radical, new, styles, of, baroque, art, both, embraced, and, developed, high, renaissance, models, and, broke, new, ground, both, in, religious, art, and, in, new, varieties, of, secular, art, above, all, landscape, the, baroque, and, its, late, variant, the, rococo, were, the, first, truly, global, styles, in, the, arts, dominating, more, than, two, centuries, of, art, and, architecture, in, europe, latin, america, and, beyond, from, circa, 1580, to, circa, 1750, born, in, the, painting, studios, of, bologna, and, rome, in, the, 1580s, and, 1590s, and, in, roman, sculptural, and, architectural, ateliers, in, the, second, and, third, decades, of, the, 17th, century, the, baroque, spread, swiftly, throughout, italy, spain, and, portugal, flanders, france, the, netherlands, england, scandinavia, and, russia, as, well, as, to, central, and, eastern, european, centres, from, munich, germany, to, vilnius, lithuania, the, portuguese, spanish, and, french, empires, and, the, dutch, treading, network, had, a, leading, role, in, spreading, the, two, styles, into, the, americas, and, colonial, africa, and, asia, to, places, such, as, lima, mozambique, goa, and, the, philippines, just, like, paintings, and, sculptures, baroque, cathedrals, and, palaces, are, characterised, by, the, use, of, illusion, and, drama, as, well, they, also, frequently, use, dramatic, effects, of, light, and, shade, and, have, sumptuous, highly, decorated, interiors, that, blurred, the, boundaries, between, architecture, painting, and, sculpture, another, important, characteristic, of, baroque, architecture, was, the, presence, of, dynamism, done, through, curves, solomonic, columns, and, ovals, in, france, baroque, is, synonymous, with, the, reign, of, louis, xiv, between, 1643, and, 1715, since, multiple, monumental, buildings, were, built, in, paris, versailles, and, other, parts, of, france, during, his, rule, such, as, the, palace, of, versailles, the, ch, teau, de, maisons, the, ch, teau, de, vaux, le, vicomte, the, louvre, colonnade, or, the, d, me, des, invalides, besides, the, building, itself, the, space, where, it, was, placed, has, a, role, too, baroque, buildings, try, to, seize, viewers, attention, and, to, dominate, their, surroundings, whether, on, a, small, scale, such, as, the, san, carlo, alle, quattro, fontane, in, rome, or, on, a, massive, one, like, the, new, facade, of, the, santiago, de, compostela, cathedral, designed, to, tower, over, the, city, applied, arts, prospered, during, this, period, as, well, baroque, furniture, could, be, as, bombastic, as, the, rooms, they, were, meant, to, adorn, and, their, motifs, and, techniques, were, carefully, calibrated, to, coordinate, with, the, architect, s, overall, decorative, programme, one, of, the, most, prestigious, furniture, makers, was, andr, charles, boulle, known, for, his, marquetry, technique, made, by, gluing, sheets, of, tortoiseshell, and, brass, together, and, cut, to, form, the, design, his, works, were, also, adorned, with, gilded, bronze, mounts, complex, gobelins, tapestries, featured,

central, motif, or, a, medallion, chinese, porcelain, delftware, and, mirrors, fabricated, at, saint, gobain, france, spread, rapidly, in, all, princely, palaces, and, aristocratic, residences, in, france, during, the, reign, of, louis, xiv, big, mirrors, are, put, above, fireplace, mantels, and, this, trend, will, last, long, after, the, baroque, period, originating, in, c, 1720, paris, rococo, is, characterized, by, natural, motifs, soft, colours, curving, lines, asymmetry, and, themes, including, love, nature, and, light, hearted, entertainment, its, ideals, were, delicacy, gaiety, youthfulness, and, sensuality, beginning, in, france, as, a, reaction, against, the, heavy, baroque, grandeur, of, louis, xiv, s, court, at, the, palace, of, versailles, the, rococo, movement, became, associated, particularly, with, the, powerful, madame, de, pompadour, 1721, 1764, the, mistress, of, the, new, king, louis, xv, 1710, 1774, because, of, this, the, style, was, also, known, as, pompadour, the, name, of, the, movement, derives, from, the, french, rocaille, or, pebble, and, refers, to, stones, and, shells, that, decorate, the, interiors, of, caves, as, similar, shell, forms, became, a, common, feature, in, rococo, design, it, began, as, a, design, and, decorative, arts, style, and, was, characterized, by, elegant, flowing, shapes, architecture, followed, and, then, painting, and, sculpture, the, french, painter, with, whom, the, term, rococo, is, most, often, associated, is, jean, antoine, watteau, whose, pastoral, scenes, or, f, tes, galantes, dominate, the, early, part, of, the, 18th, century, although, there, are, some, important, bavarian, churches, in, this, style, such, as, the, wieskirche, rococo, is, most, often, associated, with, secular, buildings, principally, great, palaces, and, salons, where, educated, elites, would, meet, to, discuss, literary, and, philosophical, ideas, in, paris, its, popularity, coincided, with, the, emergence, of, the, salon, as, a, new, type, of, social, gathering, the, venues, for, which, were, often, decorated, in, the, rococo, style, among, the, most, characteristically, elegant, and, refined, examples, is, the, salon, oval, de, la, princesse, of, the, h, tel, de, soubise, one, of, the, most, beautiful, 18th, century, mansions, in, paris, the, rococo, introduced, dramatic, changes, to, elite, furniture, as, it, favoured, smaller, pieces, with, narrow, sinewy, frames, and, more, delicate, often, asymmetrical, decoration, often, including, elements, of, chinoiserie, the, taste, for, far, eastern, objects, mainly, chinese, lead, to, the, use, of, chinese, painted, and, lacquered, panels, for, furniture, the, movement, spread, quickly, throughout, europe, and, as, far, as, ottoman, turkey, and, china, thanks, to, ornament, books, featuring, cartouches, arabesques, and, shell, work, as, well, as, designs, for, wall, panels, and, fireplaces, the, most, popular, were, made, by, juste, aur, le, meissonnier, 1695, 1750, jacques, fran, ois, blondel, 1705, 1774, pierre, edm, babel, 1720, 1775, and, fran, ois, de, cuvilli, s, 1695, 1768, inspired, by, the, excavations, of, the, ancient, roman, cities, of, pompeii, and, herculaneum, from, 1748, a, renewed, interest, in, the, arts, of, antiquity, occurred, neoclassicism, dominates, western, art, from, the, mid, to, late, 18th, century, until, the, 1830s, embracing, order, and, restraint, it, developed, in, reaction, to, the, perceived, frivolity, hedonism, and, decadence, of, rococo, and, exemplifying, the, rational, thinking, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, aka, the, age, of, reason, initially, the, movement, was, developed, not, by, artists, but, by, enlightenment, philosophers, they, requested, replacing, rococo, with, a, style, of, rational, art, moral, and, dedicated, to, the, soul, this, fitted, well, with, a, perception, of, classical, art, as, the, embodiment, of, realism, restraint, and, order, inspired, by, ancient, greek, and, roman, art, the, classical, history, paintings, of, the, french, artist, nicolas, poussin, 1594, 1665, and, the, ideas, of, the, german, writer, anton, raphael, mengs, 1728, 1779, and, the, german, archaeologist, and, art, historian, johann, joachim, winckelmann, 1717, 1768, neoclassicism, began, in, rome, but, soon, spread, throughout, europe, rome, had, become, the, main, focus, of, the, grand, tour, by, the, mid, 18th, century, and, aristocratic, travellers, went, there, in, search, of, classical, visions, to, recreate, on, their, country, estates, thus, spreading, the, style, across, europe, particularly, in, england, and, france, the, tour, was, also, an, opportunity, for, collecting, classical, antiquities, neoclassical, paintings, tended, to, be, populated, with, figures, posed, like, classical, statues, or, reliefs, set, in, a, locations, filled, with, archaeological, details, the, style, favoured, greek, art, over, roman, considering, it, purer, and, more, authentically, classical, in, its, aesthetic, goal, in, 1789, france, was, on, the, brink, of, its, first, revolution, and, neoclassicism, sought, to, express, their, patriotic, feelings, politics, and, art, were, closely, entwined, during, this, period, they, believed, that, art, should, be, serious, and, valued, drawings, above, painting, smooth, contours, and, paint, with, no, discernible, brushstrokes, were, the, ultimate, aim, both, painting, and, sculpture, exerted, calmness, and, restraint, and, focused, on, heroic, themes, expressing, such, noble, notions, as, self, sacrifice, and, nationalism, this, movement, paved, the, way, for, romanticism, that, appeared, when, the, idealism, of, the, revolution, faded, away, and, after, the, napoleonic, period, came, to, an, end, in, the, early, 19th, century, neoclassicism, should, not, be, seen, as, the, opposite, of, romanticism, however, but, in, some, ways, an, early, manifestation, of, it, many, art, historians, place, the, origins, of, modern, art, in, the, late, 18th, century, others, in, the, mid, 19th, century, art, historian, h, harvard, arnason, stated, a, gradual, metamorphosis, took, place, in, the, course, of, a, hundred, years, events, such, as, the, age, of, enlightenment, revolutions, and, democracies, in, america, and, france, and, the, industrial, revolution, had, far, reaching, affects, in, western, culture, people, commodities, ideas, and, information, could, travel, between, countries, and, continents, with, unprecedented, speed, and, these, changes, were, reflected, in, the, arts, the, invention, of, photography, in, the, 1830s, further, altered, certain, aspects, of, art, particularly, painting, by, the, dawn, of, the, 19th, century, a, long, and, gradual, paradigm, shift, was, complete, from, the, gothic, when, artists, were, viewed, as, craftsmen, in, the, service, of, the, church, and, monarchies, to, the, idea, of, art, for, art, s, sake, where, the, ideas, and, visions, of, the, individual, artist, were, held, in, the, high, regard, with, patronage, from, an, increasingly, literate, affluent, and, urban, middle, and, upper, class, population, that, had, been, emerging, for, 200, years, particularly, in, paris, and, london, a, dichotomy, began, in, the, late, 18th, century, between, neoclassicism, and, romanticism, that, subdivided, and, continued, to, run, through, virtually, every, new, movement, in, modern, art, spreading, like, waves, these, isms, defy, national, ethnic, and, chronological, boundaries, never, dominant, anywhere, for, long, they, compete, or, merge, with, each, other, in, endlessly, shifting, patterns, modern, art, has, consistently, moved, toward, international, influences, and, exchanges, from, the, exotic, curiosity, of, orientalism, the, deeper, influence, of, japonisme, to, the, arts, of, oceania, africa, and, the, americas, conversely, modern, art, has, increasingly, extended, beyond, western, europe, in, russia, and, the, us, the, arts, were, developing, to, a, degree, that, rivaled, the, leading, european, countries, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, many, of, the, major, movements, appeared, in, latin, america, australia, and, asia, too, and, geography, and, nationality, became, increasingly, insignificant, with, each, passing, decade, by, the, 20th, century,

18th, century, out, of, the, german, sturm, und, drang, movement, and, flourished, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, with, significant, and, international, manifestations, in, music, literature, and, architecture, as, well, as, the, visual, arts, it, grew, from, a, disillusionment, with, the, rationalism, of, 18th, century, enlightenment, despite, being, often, viewed, as, the, opposite, of, neoclassicism, there, were, some, stylistic, overlapping, with, both, movements, and, many, romantic, artists, were, excited, by, classicism, the, movement, focused, on, intense, emotions, imagination, and, on, the, impressive, power, of, nature, a, bigger, and, more, powerful, force, than, the, one, of, men, with, its, potential, for, disaster, neoclassicism, is, a, new, revival, of, classical, antiquity, while, romanticism, refers, not, to, a, specific, style, but, to, an, attitude, of, mind, that, may, reveal, itself, in, any, number, of, ways, one, of, the, earliest, expressions, of, romanticism, was, in, the, english, landscape, garden, carefully, designed, to, appear, natural, and, standing, in, dramatic, contrast, to, the, formal, gardens, of, the, time, the, concept, of, the, natural, english, garden, was, adopted, throughout, europe, and, america, in, the, following, decades, in, architecture, the, romantics, frequently, turned, to, alternative, sources, other, than, the, greek, and, roman, examples, admired, by, the, neo, classicist, romantic, architecture, often, revived, gothic, forms, and, other, styles, such, as, exotic, eastern, models, the, palace, of, westminster, houses, of, parliament, london, is, an, example, of, romantic, architecture, that, is, also, referred, to, as, gothic, revival, in, painting, romanticism, is, exemplified, by, the, paintings, of, francisco, goya, in, spain, eug, ne, delacroix, and, th, odore, g, ricault, in, france, william, blake, henry, fuseli, samuel, palmer, and, william, turner, in, england, caspar, david, friedrich, and, philipp, otto, runge, in, germany, francesco, hayez, in, italy, johan, christian, claussen, dahl, in, norway, and, thomas, cole, in, america, examples, of, sculptors, of, the, romantic, period, include, antoine, louis, barye, jean, baptiste, carpeaux, auguste, pr, ault, and, fran, ois, rude, as, romanticism, ran, its, course, some, aspects, of, the, movement, evolved, into, symbolism, academism, is, the, codification, of, art, into, rules, that, can, be, learned, in, art, academies, it, promotes, the, classical, ideals, of, beauty, and, artistic, perfection, there, was, also, a, very, strict, hierarchy, of, subjects, at, the, top, there, were, paintings, that, depicted, historic, events, including, the, biblical, and, classical, ones, followed, by, the, portrait, and, by, the, landscape, at, the, bottom, of, the, hierarchy, were, still, life, and, genre, painting, nicolas, poussin, was, the, artist, whose, works, and, theories, played, the, most, significant, role, in, the, development, of, academism, the, vales, of, academism, were, situated, in, the, centre, of, the, enlightenment, project, of, discovering, the, basic, principles, and, ideals, of, art, during, the, 18th, century, across, all, europe, many, academies, were, founded, that, will, later, dominate, the, art, of, the, 19th, century, in, order, to, study, at, an, art, academy, young, artists, had, to, take, an, admission, exam, and, after, being, admitted, they, would, study, there, for, multiple, years, most, of, the, 19th, century, french, art, movements, were, exterior, or, even, opposing, the, values, of, academism, some, of, the, most, important, artists, of, the, french, academy, were, william, bouguereau, 1825, 1905, jean, l, on, g, r, me, 1824, 1904, alexandre, cabanel, 1823, 1889, and, thomas, couture, 1815, 1879, academic, art, is, closely, related, to, beaux, arts, architecture, which, developed, in, the, same, place, and, holds, to, a, similar, classicizing, ideal, the, beaux, arts, style, takes, its, name, from, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, in, paris, where, it, developed, and, where, many, of, the, main, exponents, of, the, style, studied, when, it, comes, to, architecture, and, applied, arts, the, 19th, century, is, best, known, as, the, century, of, revivals, one, of, the, most, well, known, revivalist, styles, is, the, gothic, revival, or, neo, gothic, which, first, appeared, in, the, mid, 18th, century, in, a, few, houses, in, england, like, the, strawberry, hill, house, in, london, however, these, houses, were, isolated, cases, since, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, was, dominated, by, neoclassicism, later, between, 1830, and, 1840, a, taste, and, nostalgia, for, the, rediscovery, of, past, styles, ranging, from, the, middle, ages, to, the, 18th, century, developed, under, the, influence, of, romanticism, approximatively, until, world, war, i, rehashes, of, the, past, dominated, the, world, of, architecture, and, applied, arts, associations, between, styles, and, building, types, appeared, for, example, egyptian, for, prisons, gothic, for, churches, or, renaissance, revival, for, banks, and, exchanges, these, choices, were, the, result, of, other, associations, the, pharaohs, with, death, and, eternity, the, middle, ages, with, christianity, or, the, medici, family, with, the, rise, of, banking, and, modern, commerce, sometimes, these, styles, were, also, seen, in, a, nationalistic, way, on, the, idea, that, architecture, might, represent, the, glory, of, a, nation, some, of, them, were, seen, as, national, styles, like, the, gothic, revival, in, the, uk, and, the, german, states, or, the, romanian, revival, in, romania, augustus, pugin, called, the, gothic, style, the, absolute, duty, of, the, english, architect, despite, the, fact, that, the, style, is, of, french, origin, this, way, architecture, and, the, applied, arts, were, used, to, grant, the, aura, of, a, highly, idealized, glorious, past, some, architects, and, designers, associated, historic, styles, especially, the, medieval, ones, with, an, idealized, fantasy, organic, life, which, they, put, in, comparison, with, the, reality, of, their, time, despite, revivalism, being, so, prevalent, this, doesn, t, mean, that, there, was, no, originality, in, these, works, architects, b, nistes, and, other, craftsmen, especially, during, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, created, mixes, of, styles, by, extracting, and, interpreting, elements, specific, to, certain, eras, and, areas, this, practice, is, known, as, eclecticism, this, stylistic, development, occurred, during, a, period, when, the, competition, of, world, s, fairs, motivated, many, countries, to, invent, new, industrial, methods, of, creation, realism, emerged, in, the, mid, nineteenth, century, c, 1840, and, had, counterparts, in, sculpture, literature, and, drama, often, referred, to, as, naturalism, in, literature, in, nineteenth, century, painting, the, term, realism, refers, more, to, the, subject, matter, depicted, than, to, the, style, or, technique, realist, paintings, typically, represent, ordinary, places, and, people, engaged, in, everyday, activities, as, opposed, to, grand, idealized, landscapes, mythological, gods, biblical, subjects, and, historical, figures, and, events, that, had, often, dominated, painting, in, western, culture, courbet, said, i, cannot, paint, an, angel, because, i, have, never, seen, one, realism, was, also, in, part, a, reaction, to, the, often, dramatic, exotic, and, emotionally, charged, work, of, romanticism, the, term, realism, is, applied, relative, to, the, idealized, imagery, of, neo, classicism, and, the, romanticized, imagery, of, romanticism, artists, such, as, jean, baptiste, camille, corot, and, honor, daumier, had, loose, associations, with, realism, as, did, members, of, the, barbizon, school, particularly, jean, fran, ois, millet, but, it, was, perhaps, gustave, courbet, who, was, the, central, figure, in, the, movement, self, identifying, as, a, realist, advocating, realism, and, influencing, younger, artists, such, as, douard, manet, one, significant, aspect, of, realism, was, the, practice, of, painting, landscapes, en, plein, air, and, its, subsequent, influence, on, impressionism, beyond, france, realism, is, exemplified, by, artists, such, as, wilhelm, leibl, in, germany, ford, madox, brown, in, england, and, winslow, homer, in, the, united, states, art, historian, h, h, arnason, wrote, the, chronological, sequence, of, neo, classicism, romanticism, and, realism, is, of, course, only, a, convenient, stratification, of, movements, or, tendencies, so, inextricably, bound, up, with, one, another, and, with, the, preceding, movements, that, it, is, impossible, to, tell, where, one, ended, and, another, began, and, this, becomes, even, more, pertinent, and, complex, as, one, follows, all, of, the, movements, and, isms, into, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, impressionism, emerged, in, france, under, the, influences, of, realism, the, barbizon, school, and, en, plein,

in, the, 1870s, and, later, to, america, to, a, lesser, extent, it, evolved, from, romanticism, without, a, clear, or, defining, demarcation, point, although, poetry, literature, and, specifically, the, publication, of, charles, baudelaire, s, les, fleurs, du, mal, the, flowers, of, evil, in, 1857, were, significant, in, the, development, of, symbolism, it, had, international, expression, in,

with, four, very, original, but, different, styles, collectively, their, work, anticipated, and, often, directly, influenced, much, of, the, avant, garde, art, that, appeared, before, the, first, world, war, including, fauvism, cubism, expressionism, and, early, abstraction, c, zanne, particularly, influential, on, cubism, and, van, gogh, worked, in, relative, isolation, away, from, paris, at, critical, points, in, their, careers, while, seurat, and, gauguin, worked, in, groups, more, collaboratively, at, key, points, in, their, development, another, important, artist, of, the, period, is,

worked, in, a, range, of, styles, and, groups, most, had, come, under, the, sway, of, impressionism, at, some, point, but, pushed, their, work, beyond, it, into, a, number, of, factions, as, early, as, the, mid, 1880s, sometimes, as, a, logical, development, of, impressionism, other, times, as, a, reaction, against, it, post, impressionists, typically, depicted, impressionist, subjects, but,

historicism, which, is, the, use, of, visual, styles, that, consciously, echo, the, style, of, a, previous, artistic, era, between, c, 1870, and, 1900, a, crisis, of, historicism, occurred, during, which, the, historicist, culture, was, critiqued, one, of, the, voices, being, friedrich, nietzsche, in, 1874, who, diagnosed, a, malignant, historical, fervour, as, one, of, the, crippling, symptoms,

1930s, it, had, ancient, greek, roman, african, aztec, and, japanese, influences, but, also, futurist, cubist, and, bauhaus, ones, it, sometimes, blended, with, the, egyptian, revival, style, due, to, the, discovery, in, 1922, of, the, tomb, of, tutankhamun, and, the, egyptomania, that, it, caused, two, examples, of, this, are, le, louxor, cinema, in, paris, 1919, 1921, by, henri, zipcy, and, the,

literary, group, of, poets, and, writers, in, paris, it, soon, developed, into, an, international, movement, that, included, painters, sculptors, photographers, and, filmmakers, a, second, manifeste, du, surr, alisme, was, published, in, 1929, surrealism, did, not, have, significant, expression, in, applied, or, decorative, arts, architecture, or, music, although, a, few, isolated, examples, could, be, identified, e, g, chess, sets, furniture, and, las, pozas, the, small, and, short, lived, metaphysical, school, c, 1910, 1921, with, giorgio, de, chirico, as, its, principal, figure, was, highly, influential, on, surrealism, the, surrealist, explored, a, myriad, of, innovative, techniques, some, had, recently, been, developed, in, cubism, and, dada, others, were, new, including, collage, found, objects, assemblage, random, chance, rayographs, photograms, painting, on, sand, dripping, and, flinging, paint, decalcomania, frottage, fumage, and, raclage, two, fundamental, approaches, predominate, surrealist, art, automatism, dominated, in, the, early, years, which, can, be, seen, in, the, work, of, artist, like, andr, masson, and, joan, mir, other, artist, swayed, by, work, of, giorgio, de, chirico, used, more, traditional, methods, and, mediums, to, illustrate, unfiltered, thoughts, and, incongruous, juxtapositions, including, salvador, dal, and, ren, magritte,

were, discussed, in, a, successive, series, of, journals, la, r, volution, surr, aliste, 1924, 1929, le, surrealisme, au, service, de, la, revolution, 1930, 1933, minotaure, 1933, 1939, vvv, 1942, 1944, the, automatic, paintings, produced, by, andr, masson, and, joan, mir, as, well, as, latecomers, to, surrealism, like, roberto, matta, and, arshile, gorky, had, a, considerable, influenced, on, the, abstract, expressionist, in, the, late, 1940s, with, a, measure, of, dada, s, irreverence, and, contempt, for, the, traditional, political, religious, and, bourgeois, values, of, western, culture, that, they, believed, had, led, the, world, into, the, first, world, war, breton, and, other, founding, members, were, veterans, the, surrealist, explored, the, possibilities, that, had, been, opened, up, by, sigmund, freud, regarding, the, subconscious, mind, pure, psychic, automatism, by, which, one, intends, to, express, verbally, in, writing, or, by, any, other, method, the, real, functioning, of, the, mind, dictation, by, thought, in, the, absence, of, any, control, exercised, by, reason, and, beyond, any, aesthetic, or, moral, preoccupation, surrealism, sought, to, express, pure, thought, unfiltered, and, uncensored, by, political, religious, moral, or, rational, principles, as, europe, struggled, to, recover, from, world, war, ii, america, moved, into, a, position, of, political, economic, and, cultural, strength, during, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, abstract, expressionism, emerged, as, the, first, specifically, american, art, movement, to, have, an, international, impact, in, consequence, the, art, world, s, focus, shifted, from, europe, to, new, york, abstract, expressionists, were, a, small, group, of, loosely, associated, artists, who, had, similar, outlooks, but, different, approaches, they, were, influenced, by, surrealism, and, believed, in, spontaneity, freedom, of, expression, and, abandonment, of, the, themes, of, american, life, that, had, characterized, national, art, of, recent, decades, one, of, the, most, famous, representative, of, this, movement, was, jackson, pollock, known, for, his, painting, made, by, pouring, flicking, and, dripping, paint, on, to, huge, canvases, on, the, ground, other, artists, include, willem, de, kooning, franz, kline, robert, motherwell, barnett, newman, mark, rothko, and, clyfford, still, after, world, war, ii, consumerism, and, the, mass, media, surged, and, as, a, result, pop, art, developed, in, both, london, and, new, york, in, a, london, exhibition, in, 1956, the, word, pop, was, used, in, a, collage, created, by, richard, hamilton, 1922, 2011, made, of, american, magazines, pop, art, was, a, reaction, against, abstract, expressionism, and, interpreted, ideas, of, pop, culture, in, celebrating, and, commenting, on, consumerism, pop, artists, as, they, became, known, produced, colorful, images, based, on, advertising, the, media, and, shopping, featuring, film, stars, comic, strips, flags, packaging, and, food, things, that, everyone, rather, than, just, a, highbrow, few, could, relate, to, the, term, minimalism, was, not, new, but, it, gained, momentum, in, the, 1960s, specifically, describing, a, style, of, art, characterized, by, detached, restraint, originating, in, new, york, it, was, a, reaction, against, abstract, expressionism, but, it, also, embraced, constructivist, ideas, that, art, should, be, made, of, modern, materials, thus, minimalist, artists, primarily, sculptors, often, used, non, traditional, materials, and, production, methods, often, employing, industrial, or, specialist, fabricators, to, produce, works, to, their, specifications, the, term, was, chiefly, used, to, describe, a, group, of, american, sculptors, who, re, evaluated, the, space, around, them, aiming, to, challenge, assumptions, and, present, familiar, objects, in, new, ways, their, artworks, don, t, have, any, symbolism, or, hidden, meaning, as, they, try, to, enable, viewers, to, re, evaluate, art, and, space, around, forms, unlike, a, figural, sculpture, on, which, the, viewer, focuses, to, the, exclusion, of, the, room, in, which, it, stands, minimalist, art, becomes, one, with, its, space, by, focusing, on, the, effects, of, context, and, the, theatricality, of, the, viewing, experience, minimalism, exerted, an, indirect, but, powerful, influence, on, later, developments, in, conceptual, and, performance, art, as, well, as, providing, a, foil, for, the, rise, of, postmodernism, despite, developing, almost, 50, years, after, marcel, duchamp, s, ideas, conceptual, art, showed, that, art, does, not, always, have, to, be, judged, aesthetically, it, was, never, a, single, cohesive, movement, but, an, umbrella, term, that, now, covers, several, types, of, art, and, emerged, more, or, less, concurrently, in, america, and, europe, first, defined, in, new, york, conceptual, artists, promote, the, art, of, ideas, or, concepts, suggesting, that, they, can, be, more, valid, in, the, modern, world, than, technical, skill, or, aesthetics, no, matter, the, art, media, of, an, artwork, it, is, considered, as, no, more, than, a, vehicle, for, presenting, the, concept, at, its, most, extreme, conceptual, art, foregoes, the, physical, object, completely, using, verbal, or, written, message, to, convey, the, idea, traditionally, many, creative, acts, such, as, sewing, weaving, and, quilting, have, been, considered, as, women, s, work, described, as, crafts, and, denied, the, cachet, and, public, recognition, of, so, called, high, or, fine, arts, such, as, sculpture, and, painting, many, artists, have, now, challenged, this, hierarchy, by, either, expanding, the, scope, of, a, fine, art, such, as, sculpture, by, creating, soft, sculptures, using, unconventional, materials, and, practices, or, by, reclaiming, and, redefining, the, materials, and, methods, of, so, called, craftwork, publicly, exhibiting, their, work, in, museums, and, galleries, and, thus, elevating, the, status, of, the, decorative, and, applied, arts, artists, of, the, twentieth, and, twenty, first, centuries, effecting, this, radical, change, include, maria, martinez, anni, albers, lucie, rie, lenore, tawney, louise, bourgeois, miriam, schapiro, faith, ringgold, magdalena, abakanowicz, sheila, hicks, marva, lee, pitchford, jolly, judy,
