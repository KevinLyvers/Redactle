wars, 18, may, 1803, is, often, used, when, britain, and, france, ended, the, only, short, period, of, peace, between, 1792, and, 1814, the, napoleonic, wars, began, with, the, war, of, the, third, coalition, which, was, the, first, of, the, coalition, wars, against, the, first, french, republic, after, napoleon, s, accession, as, leader, of, france, britain, ended, the, treaty, of, amiens, declaring, war, on, france, in, may, 1803, among, the, reasons, were, napoleon, s, changes, to, the, international, system, in, western, europe, especially, in, switzerland, germany, italy, and, the, netherlands, historian, frederick, kagan, argues, that, britain, was, irritated, in, particular, by, napoleon, s, assertion, of, control, over, switzerland, furthermore, britons, felt, insulted, when, napoleon, stated, that, their, country, deserved, no, voice, in, european, affairs, even, though, king, george, iii, was, an, elector, of, the, holy, roman, empire, for, its, part, russia, decided, that, the, intervention, in, switzerland, indicated, that, napoleon, was, not, looking, toward, a, peaceful, resolution, of, his, differences, with, the, other, european, powers, the, british, hastily, enforced, a, naval, blockade, of, france, to, starve, it, of, resources, napoleon, responded, with, economic, embargoes, against, britain, and, sought, to, eliminate, britain, s, continental, allies, to, break, the, coalitions, arrayed, against, him, the, so, called, continental, system, formed, a, league, of, armed, neutrality, to, disrupt, the, blockade, and, enforce, free, trade, with, france, the, british, responded, by, capturing, the, danish, fleet, breaking, up, the, league, and, later, secured, dominance, over, the, seas, allowing, it, to, freely, continue, its, strategy, napoleon, won, the, war, of, the, third, coalition, at, austerlitz, forcing, the, austrian, empire, out, of, the, war, and, formally, dissolving, the, holy, roman, empire, within, months, prussia,

campaign, napoleon, subsequently, defeated, russia, at, friedland, creating, powerful, client, states, in, eastern, europe, and, ending, the, fourth, coalition, concurrently, the, refusal, of, portugal, to, commit, to, the, continental, system, and, spain, s, failure, to, maintain, it, led, to, the, peninsular, war, and, the, outbreak, of, the, war, of, the, fifth, coalition, the, french,

poland, and, russia, s, withdrawal, from, the, continental, system, led, to, napoleon, invading, russia, in, june, 1812, the, invasion, was, an, unmitigated, disaster, for, napoleon, scorched, earth,

escaped, from, elba, in, 1815, gathering, enough, support, to, overthrow, the, monarchy, of, louis, xviii, triggering, a, seventh, and, final, coalition, against, him, napoleon, was, then, decisively, defeated, at, waterloo, and, he, abdicated, again, on, 22, june, on, 15, july, he, surrendered, to, the, british, at, rochefort, and, was, permanently, exiled, to, remote, saint, helena, the, treaty,

resources, to, a, collective, war, effort, tactically, the, french, army, had, redefined, the, role, of, artillery, while, napoleon, emphasised, mobility, to, offset, numerical, disadvantages, and, aerial, surveillance, was, used, for, the, first, time, in, warfare, the, highly, successful, spanish, guerrillas, demonstrated, the, capability, of, a, people, driven, by, fervent, nationalism,

deep, impact, on, european, social, culture, many, subsequent, revolutions, such, as, that, of, russia, looked, to, the, french, as, a, source, of, inspiration, while, its, core, founding, tenets, greatly, expanded, the, arena, of, human, rights, and, shaped, modern, political, philosophies, in, use, today, the, outbreak, of, the, french, revolution, had, been, received, with, great, alarm, by, the, rulers, of, europe, s, continental, powers, further, exacerbated, by, the, execution, of, louis, xvi, and, the, overthrow, of, the, french, monarchy, in, 1793, austria, the, kingdom, of,

period, of, warfare, from, 1792, to, 1815, as, the, great, french, war, or, as, the, final, phase, of, the, anglo, french, second, hundred, years, war, spanning, the, period, 1689, to, 1815, historian, mike, rapport, 2013, suggested, using, the, term, french, wars, to, unambiguously, describe, the, entire, period, from, 1792, to, 1815, in, france, the, napoleonic, wars, are, generally, integrated, with, the, french, revolutionary, wars, les, guerres, de, la, r, volution, et, de, l, empire, german, historiography, may, count, the, war, of, the, second, coalition, 1798, 9, 1801, 2, during, which, napoleon, had, seized, power, as, the, erster, napoleonischer, krieg, first, napoleonic, war, in, dutch, historiography, it, is, common, to, refer, to, the, 7, major, wars, between, 1792, and, 1815, as, the, coalition, wars, coalitieoorlogen, referring, to, the, first, two, as, the, french, revolution, wars, franse, revolutieoorlogen, napoleon, was, and, remains, famous, for, his, battlefield, victories, and, historians, have, spent, enormous, attention, in, analysing, them, in, 2008, donald, sutherland, wrote, the, ideal, napoleonic, battle, was, to, manipulate, the, enemy, into, an, unfavourable, position, through, manoeuvre, and, deception, force, him, to, commit, his, main, forces, and, reserve, to, the, main, battle, and, then, undertake, an, enveloping, attack, with, uncommitted, or, reserve, troops, on, the, flank, or, rear, such, a, surprise, attack, would, either, produce, a, devastating, effect, on, morale, or, force, him, to, weaken, his, main, battle, line, either, way, the, enemy, s, own, impulsiveness, began, the, process, by, which, even, a, smaller, french, army, could, defeat, the, enemy, s, forces, one, by, one, after, 1807, napoleon, s, creation, of, a, highly, mobile, well, armed, artillery, force, gave, artillery, usage, an, increased, tactical, importance, napoleon, rather, than, relying, on, infantry, to, wear, away, the, enemy, s, defences, could, now, use, massed, artillery, as, a, spearhead, to, pound, a, break, in, the, enemy, s, line, once, that, was, achieved, he, sent, in, infantry, and, cavalry, britain, was, irritated, by, several, french, actions, following, the, treaty, of, amiens, bonaparte, annexed, piedmont, and, elba, made, himself, president, of, the, italian, republic, a, state, in, northern, italy, that, france, had, set, up, and, failed, to, evacuate, holland, as, it, had, agreed, to, do, in, the, treaty, france, then, continued, to, interfere, with, british, trade, despite, peace, having, been, made, and, complained, about, britain, harbouring, certain, individuals, and, not, cracking, down, on, the, anti, french, press, malta, was, captured, by, britain, during, the, war, and, was, subject, to, a, complex, arrangement, in, the, 10th, article, of, the, treaty, of, amiens, where, it, was, to, be, restored, to, the, knights, of, st, john, with, a, neapolitan, garrison, and, placed, under, the, guarantee, of, third, powers, the, weakening, of, the, knights, of, st, john, by, the, confiscation, of, their, assets, in, france, and, spain, along, with, delays, in, obtaining, guarantees, prevented, the, british, from, evacuating, it, after, three, months, as, stipulated, in, the, treaty, the, helvetic, republic, was, set, up, by, france, when, it, invaded, switzerland, in, 1798, france, had, withdrawn, its, troops, but, violent, strife, broke, out, against, the, government, which, many, swiss, saw, as, overly, centralised, bonaparte, reoccupied, the, country, in, october, 1802, and, imposed, a, compromise, settlement, this, caused, widespread, outrage, in, britain, which, protested, that, this, was, a, violation, of, the, treaty, of, lun, ville, although, continental, powers, were, unprepared, to, act, the, british, decided, to, send, an, agent, to, help, the, swiss, obtain, supplies, and, also, ordered, their, military, not, to, return, cape, colony, to, holland, as, they, had, committed, to, do, in, the, treaty, of, amiens, swiss, resistance, collapsed, before, anything, could, be, accomplished, and, after, a, month, britain, countermanded, the, orders, to, not, restore, cape, colony, at, the, same, time, russia, finally, joined, the, guarantee, regarding, malta, concerned, that, there, would, be, hostilities, when, bonaparte, found, out, that, cape, colony, had, been, retained, the, british, began, to, procrastinate, on, the, evacuation, of, malta, in, january, 1803, a, government, paper, in, france, published, a, report, from, a, commercial, agent, which, noted, the, ease, with, which, egypt, could, be, conquered, the, british, seized, on, this, to, demand, satisfaction, and, security, before, evacuating, malta, which, was, a, convenient, stepping, stone, to, egypt, france, disclaimed, any, desire, to, seize, egypt, and, asked, what, sort, of, satisfaction, was, required, but, the, british, were, unable, to, give, a, response, there, was, still, no, thought, of, going, to, war, prime, minister, henry, addington, publicly, affirmed, that, britain, was, in, a, state, of, peace, in, early, march, 1803, the, addington, ministry, received, word, that, cape, colony, had, been, reoccupied, by, the, british, army, in, accordance, with, the, orders, which, had, subsequently, been, countermanded, on, 8, march, they, ordered, military, preparations, to, guard, against, possible, french, retaliation, and, justified, them, by, falsely, claiming, that, it, was, only, in, response, to, french, preparations, and, that, they, were, conducting, serious, negotiations, with, france, in, a, few, days, it, was, known, that, cape, colony, had, been, surrendered, in, accordance, with, the, counter, orders, but, it, was, too, late, bonaparte, berated, the, british, ambassador, in, front, of, 200, spectators, over, the, military, preparations, the, addington, ministry, realised, they, would, face, an, inquiry, over, their, false, reasons, for, the, military, preparations, and, during, april, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, secure, the, support, of, william, pitt, to, shield, them, from, damage, in, the, same, month, the, ministry, issued, an, ultimatum, to, france, demanding, a, retention, of, malta, for, at, least, ten, years, the, permanent, acquisition, of, the, island, of, lampedusa, from, the, kingdom, of, sicily, and, the, evacuation, of, holland, they, also, offered, to, recognise, french, gains, in, italy, if, they, evacuated, switzerland, and, compensated, the, king, of, sardinia, for, his, territorial, losses, france, offered, to, place, malta, in, the, hands, of, russia, to, satisfy, british, concerns, pull, out, of, holland, when, malta, was, evacuated, and, form, a, convention, to, give, satisfaction, to, britain, on, other, issues, the, british, falsely, denied, that, russia, had, made, an, offer, and, their, ambassador, left, paris, desperate, to, avoid, a, war, bonaparte, sent, a, secret, offer, where, he, agreed, to, let, britain, retain, malta, if, france, could, occupy, the, otranto, peninsula, in, naples, all, efforts, were, futile, and, britain, declared, war, on, 18, may, 1803, britain, ended, the, uneasy, truce, created, by, the, treaty, of, amiens, when, it, had, declared, war, on, france, in, may, 1803, the, british, were, increasingly, angered, by, napoleon, s, reordering, of, the, international, system, in, western, europe, especially, in, switzerland, germany, italy, and, the, netherlands, kagan, argues, that, britain, was, especially, alarmed, by, napoleon, s, assertion, of, control, over, switzerland, the, british, felt, insulted, when, napoleon, said, it, deserved, no, voice, in, european, affairs, even, though, king, george, was, an, elector, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, sought, to, restrict, the, london, newspapers, that, were, vilifying, him, britain, had, a, sense, of, loss, of, control, as, well, as, loss, of, markets, and, was, worried, by, napoleon, s, possible, threat, to, its, overseas, colonies, mclynn, argues, that, britain, went, to, war, in, 1803, out, of, a, mixture, of, economic, motives, and, national, neuroses, an, irrational, anxiety, about, napoleon, s, motives, and, intentions, mclynn, concludes, that, it, proved, to, be, the, right, choice, for, britain, because, in, the, long, run, napoleon, s, intentions, were, hostile, to, the, british, national, interest, napoleon, was, not, ready, for, war, and, so, this, was, the, best, time, for, britain, to, stop, them, britain, seized, upon, the, malta, issue, refusing, to, follow, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, amiens, and, evacuate, the, island, the, deeper, british, grievance, was, their, perception, that, napoleon, was, taking, personal, control, of, europe, making, the, international, system, unstable, and, forcing, britain, to, the, sidelines, numerous, scholars, have, argued, that, napoleon, s, aggressive, posture, made, him, enemies, and, cost, him, potential, allies, as, late, as, 1808, the, continental, powers, affirmed, most, of, his, gains, and, titles, but, the, continuing, conflict, with, britain, led, him, to, start, the, peninsular, war, and, the, invasion, of, russia, which, many, scholars, see, as, a, dramatic, miscalculation, there, was, one, serious, attempt, to, negotiate, peace, with, france, during, the, war, made, by, charles, james, fox, in, 1806, the, british, wanted, to, retain, their, overseas, conquests, and, have, hanover, restored, to, george, iii, in, exchange, for, accepting, french, conquests, on, the, continent, the, french, were, willing, to, cede, malta, cape, colony, tobago, and, french, indian, posts, to, britain, but, wanted, to, obtain, sicily, in, exchange, for, the, restoration, of, hanover, a, condition, which, the, british, refused, unlike, its, many, coalition, partners, britain, remained, at, war, during, the, period, of, the, napoleonic, wars, protected, by, naval, supremacy, in, the, words, of, admiral, jervis, to, the, house, of, lords, i, do, not, say, my, lords, that, the, french, will, not, come, i, say, only, they, will, not, come, by, sea, britain, did, not, have, to, spend, the, entire, war, defending, itself, and, could, thus, focus, on, supporting, its, embattled, allies, maintaining, low, intensity, land, warfare, on, a, global, scale, for, over, a, decade, the, british, government, paid, out, a, large, amount, of, money, to, other, european, states, so, that, they, could, pay, armies, in, the, field, against, france, these, payments, are, colloquially, known, as, the, golden, cavalry, of, st, george, the, british, army, provided, long, term, support, to, the, spanish, rebellion, in, the, peninsular, war, of, 1808, 1814, assisted, by, spanish, guerrilla, little, war, tactics, anglo, portuguese, forces, under, arthur, wellesley, supported, the, spanish, who, campaigned, successfully, against, the, french, armies, eventually, driving, them, from, spain, and, allowing, britain, to, invade, southern, france, by, 1815, the, british, army, played, the, central, role, in, the, final, defeat, of, napoleon, at, waterloo, beyond, minor, naval, actions, against, british, imperial, interests, the, napoleonic, wars, were, much, less, global, in, their, scope, than, preceding, conflicts, such, as, the, seven, years, war, which, historians, term, a, world, war, in, response, to, the, naval, blockade, of, the, french, coasts, enacted, by, the, british, government, on, 16, may, 1806, napoleon, issued, the, berlin, decree, on, november, 21, 1806, which, brought, into, effect, the, continental, system, this, policy, aimed, to, eliminate, the, threat, from, britain, by, closing, french, controlled, territory, to, its, trade, britain, maintained, a, standing, army, of, 220, 000, at, the, height, of, the, napoleonic, wars, of, whom, less, than, 50, were, available, for, campaigning, the, rest, were, necessary, for, garrisoning, ireland, and, the, colonies, and, providing, security, for, britain, france, s, strength, peaked, at, around, 2, 500, 000, full, time, and, part, time, soldiers, including, several, hundred, thousand, national, guardsmen, whom, napoleon, could, draft, into, the, military, if, necessary, both, nations, enlisted, large, numbers, of, sedentary, militia, who, were, unsuited, for, campaigning, and, were, mostly, employed, to, release, regular, forces, for, active, duty, the, royal, navy, disrupted, france, s, extra, continental, trade, by, seizing, and, threatening, french, shipping, and, colonial, possessions, but, could, do, nothing, about, france, s, trade, with, the, major, continental, economies, and, posed, little, threat, to, french, territory, in, europe, france, s, population, and, agricultural, capacity, greatly, outstripped, britain, s, britain, had, the, greatest, industrial, capacity, in, europe, and, its, mastery, of, the, seas, allowed, it, to, build, up, considerable, economic, strength, through, trade, this, ensured, that, france, could, never, consolidate, its, control, over, europe, in, peace, many, in, the, french, government, believed, that, cutting, britain, off, from, the, continent, would, end, its, economic, influence, over, europe, and, isolate, it, a, key, element, in, british, success, was, its, ability, to, mobilise, the, nation, s, industrial, and, financial, resources, and, apply, them, to, defeating, france, though, the, uk, had, a, population, of, approximately, 16, million, against, france, s, 30, million, the, french, numerical, advantage, was, offset, by, british, subsidies, that, paid, for, many, of, the, austrian, and, russian, soldiers, peaking, at, about, 450, 000, men, in, 1813, under, the, anglo, russian, agreement, of, 1803, britain, paid, a, subsidy, of, 1, 5, million, for, every, 100, 000, russian, soldiers, in, the, field, british, national, output, continued, to, be, strong, and, the, well, organised, business, sector, channeled, products, into, what, the, military, needed, britain, used, its, economic, power, to, expand, the, royal, navy, doubling, the, number, of, frigates, adding, 50, per, cent, more, large, ships, of, the, line, and, increasing, the, number, of, sailors, from, 15, 000, to, 133, 000, in, eight, years, after, the, war, began, in, 1793, france, saw, its, navy, shrink, by, more, than, half, the, smuggling, of, finished, products, into, the, continent, undermined, french, efforts, to, weaken, the, british, economy, by, cutting, off, markets, subsidies, to, russia, and, austria, kept, them, in, the, war, the, british, budget, in, 1814, reached, 98, million, including, 10, million, for, the, royal, navy, 40, million, for, the, army, 10, million, for, the, allies, and, 38, million, as, interest, on, the, national, debt, which, had, soared, to, 679, million, more, than, double, the, gdp, this, debt, was, supported, by, hundreds, of, thousands, of, investors, and, taxpayers, despite, the, higher, taxes, on, land, and, a, new, income, tax, the, cost, of, the, war, amounted, to, 831, million, in, contrast, the, french, financial, system, was, inadequate, and, napoleon, s, forces, had, to, rely, in, part, on, requisitions, from, conquered, lands, from, london, in, 1813, to, 1815, nathan, mayer, rothschild, was, crucial, in, almost, single, handedly, financing, the, british, war, effort, organising, the, shipment, of, bullion, to, the, duke, of, wellington, s, armies,

he, could, invade, he, needed, to, achieve, naval, superiority, or, at, least, to, pull, the, british, fleet, away, from, the, english, channel, a, complex, plan, to, distract, the, british, by, threatening, their, possessions, in, the, west, indies, failed, when, a, franco, spanish, fleet, under, admiral, villeneuve, turned, back, after, an, indecisive, action, off, cape, finisterre, on, 22, july, 1805, the, royal, navy, blockaded, villeneuve, in, c, diz, until, he, left, for, naples, on, 19, october, the, british, squadron, caught, and, overwhelmingly, defeated, the, combined, enemy, fleet, in, the, battle, of, trafalgar, on, 21, october, the, british, commander, lord, nelson, died, in, the, battle, napoleon, never, again, had, the, opportunity, to, challenge, the, british, at,

the, french, from, the, batavian, republic, roughly, present, day, netherlands, and, the, swiss, confederation, austria, joined, the, alliance, after, the, annexation, of, genoa, and, the, proclamation, of, napoleon, as, king, of, italy, on, 17, march, 1805, sweden, which, had, already, agreed, to, lease, swedish, pomerania, as, a, military, base, for, british, troops, against, france, entered, the, coalition, on, 9, august, the, austrians, began, the, war, by, invading, bavaria, on, 8, september, 1805, with, an, army, of, about, 70, 000, under, karl, mack, von, leiberich, and, the, french, army, marched, out, from, boulogne, in, late, july, 1805, to, confront, them, at, ulm, 25, september, 20, october, napoleon, surrounded, mack, s, army, forcing, its, surrender, without,

personally, present, on, 2, december, napoleon, crushed, the, austro, russian, force, in, moravia, at, austerlitz, usually, considered, his, greatest, victory, he, inflicted, 25, 000, casualties, on, a, numerically, superior, enemy, army, while, sustaining, fewer, than, 7, 000, in, his, own, force, austria, signed, the, treaty, of, pressburg, 26, december, 1805, and, left, the, coalition, the, treaty, required, the, austrians, to, give, up, venetia, to, the, french, dominated, kingdom, of, italy, and, the, tyrol, to, bavaria, with, the, withdrawal, of, austria, from, the, war, stalemate, ensued, napoleon, s, army, had, a, record, of, continuous, unbroken, victories, on, land, but, the, full, force, of, the, russian, army, had, not, yet, come, into, play, napoleon, had, now, consolidated, his, hold, on, france, had, taken, control, of, belgium, the, netherlands, switzerland, and, most, of, western, germany, and, northern, italy, his, admirers, say, that, napoleon, wanted, to, stop, now, but, was, forced, to, continue, in, order, to, gain, greater, security, from, the, countries, that, refused, to, accept, his, conquests, esdaile, rejects, that, explanation, and, instead, says, that, it, was, a, good, time, to, stop, expansion, for, the, major, powers, were, ready, to, accept, napoleon, as, he, was, in, 1806, both, russia, and, britain, had, been, positively, eager, to, make, peace, and, they, might, well, have, agreed, to, terms, that, would, have, left, the, napoleonic, imperium, almost, completely, intact, as, for, austria, and, prussia, they, simply, wanted, to, be, left, alone, to, have, secured, a, compromise, peace, then, would, have, been, comparatively, easy, but, napoleon, was, prepared, to, make, no, concessions, within, months, of, the, collapse, of, the, third, coalition, the, fourth, coalition, 1806, 1807, against, france, was, formed, by, britain, prussia, russia, saxony, and, sweden, in, july, 1806, napoleon, formed, the, confederation, of, the, rhine, out, of, the, many, small, german, states, which, constituted, the, rhineland, and, most, other, western, parts, of, germany, he, amalgamated, many, of, the, smaller, states, into, larger, electorates, duchies, and, kingdoms, to, make, the, governance, of, non, prussian, germany, smoother, napoleon, elevated, the, rulers, of, the, two, largest, confederation, states, saxony, and, bavaria, to, the, status, of, kings, in, august, 1806, the, prussian, king, frederick, william, iii, decided, to, go, to, war, independently, of, any, other, great, power, the, army, of, russia, a, prussian, ally, in, particular, was, too, far, away, to, assist, on, october, 8, 1806, napoleon, unleashed, all, the, french, forces, east, of, the, rhine, into, prussia, napoleon, defeated, a, prussian, army, at, jena, 14, october, 1806, and, davout, defeated, another, at, auerst, dt, on, the, same, day, 160, 000, french, soldiers, increasing, in, number, as, the, campaign, went, on, attacked, prussia, moving, with, such, speed, that, they, destroyed, the, entire, prussian, army, as, an, effective, military, force, out, of, 250, 000, troops, the, prussians, sustained, 25, 000, casualties, lost, a, further, 150, 000, as, prisoners, 4, 000, artillery, pieces, and, over, 100, 000, muskets, at, jena, napoleon, had, fought, only, a, detachment, of, the, prussian, force, the, battle, at, auerst, dt, involved, a, single, french, corps, defeating, the, bulk, of, the, prussian, army, napoleon, entered, berlin, on, 27, october, 1806, he, visited, the, tomb, of, frederick, the, great, and, instructed, his, marshals, to, remove, their, hats, there, saying, if, he, were, alive, we, wouldn, t, be, here, today, napoleon, had, taken, only, 19, days, from, beginning, his, attack, on, prussia, to, knock, it, out, of, the, war, with, the, capture, of, berlin, and, the, destruction, of, its, principal, armies, at, jena, and, auerst, dt, saxony, abandoned, prussia, and, together, with, small, states, from, north, germany, allied, with, france, in, the, next, stage, of, the, war, the, french, drove, russian, forces, out, of, poland, and, employed, many, polish, and, german, soldiers, in, several, sieges, in, silesia, and, pomerania, with, the, assistance, of, dutch, and, italian, soldiers, in, the, latter, case, napoleon, then, turned, north, to, confront, the, remainder, of, the, russian, army, and, to, try, to, capture, the, temporary, prussian, capital, at, k, nigsberg, a, tactical, draw, at, eylau, 7, 8, february, 1807, followed, by, capitulation, at, danzig, 24, may, 1807, and, the, battle, of, heilsberg, 10, june, 1807, forced, the, russians, to, withdraw, further, north, napoleon, decisively, beat, the, russian, army, at, friedland, 14, june, 1807, following, which, alexander, had, to, make, peace, with, napoleon, at, tilsit, 7, july, 1807, in, germany, and, poland, new, napoleonic, client, states, such, as, the, kingdom, of, westphalia, duchy, of, warsaw, and, republic, of, danzig, were, established, early, that, same, year, the, french, besieged, the, fortified, town, of, kolberg, which, resulted, in, a, lifting, of, the, siege, by, a, peace, treaty, on, 2, july, by, september, marshal, guillaume, brune, completed, the, occupation, of, swedish, pomerania, allowing, the, swedish, army, to, withdraw, with, all, its, munitions, of, war, britain, s, first, response, to, napoleon, s, continental, system, was, to, launch, a, major, naval, attack, against, denmark, although, ostensibly, neutral, denmark, was, under, heavy, french, and, russian, pressure, to, pledge, its, fleet, to, napoleon, london, could, not, take, the, chance, of, ignoring, the, danish, threat, in, august, 1807, the, royal, navy, besieged, and, bombarded, copenhagen, leading, to, the, capture, of, the, dano, norwegian, fleet, and, assuring, use, of, the, sea, lanes, in, the, north, and, baltic, seas, for, the, british, merchant, fleet, denmark, joined, the, war, on, the, side, of, france, but, without, a, fleet, it, had, little, to, offer, beginning, an, engagement, in, a, naval, guerrilla, war, in, which, small, gunboats, attacked, larger, british, ships, in, danish, and, norwegian, waters, denmark, also, committed, themselves, to, participate, in, a, war, against, sweden, together, with, france, and, russia, at, tilsit, napoleon, and, alexander, had, agreed, that, russia, should, force, sweden, to, join, the, continental, system, which, led, to, a, russian, invasion, of, finland, in, february, 1808, followed, by, a, danish, declaration, of, war, in, march, napoleon, also, sent, an, auxiliary, corps, consisting, of, troops, from, france, spain, and, holland, led, by, marshal, jean, baptiste, bernadotte, to, denmark, to, participate, in, the, invasion, of, sweden, but, british, naval, superiority, prevented, the, armies, from, crossing, the, resund, strait, and, the, war, came, mainly, to, be, fought, along, the, swedish, norwegian, border, at, the, congress, of, erfurt, september, october, 1808, france, and, russia, further, agreed, on, the, division, of, sweden, into, two, parts, separated, by, the, gulf, of, bothnia, where, the, eastern, part, became, the, russian, grand, duchy, of, finland, british, voluntary, attempts, to, assist, sweden, with, humanitarian, aid, remained, limited, and, did, not, prevent, sweden, from, adopting, a, more, napoleon, friendly, policy, the, war, between, denmark, and, britain, effectively, finished, with, a, british, victory, at, the, battle, of, lyng, r, in, 1812, involving, the, destruction, of, the, last, large, dano, norwegian, ship, the, frigate, najaden, in, 1807, napoleon, created, a, powerful, outpost, of, his, empire, in, central, europe, poland, had, recently, been, partitioned, by, its, three, neighbours, but, napoleon, created, the, grand, duchy, of, warsaw, which, depended, on, france, from, the, beginning, the, duchy, consisted, of, lands, seized, by, austria, and, prussia, its, grand, duke, was, napoleon, s, ally, king, frederick, augustus, i, of, saxony, but, napoleon, appointed, the, intendants, who, administered, the, country, the, population, of, 4, 3, million, was, released, from, occupation, and, by, 1814, sent, about, 200, 000, men, to, napoleon, s, armies, that, included, about, 90, 000, who, marched, with, him, to, moscow, few, marched, back, the, russians, strongly, opposed, any, move, towards, an, independent, poland, and, one, reason, napoleon, invaded, russia, in, 1812, was, to, punish, them, the, grand, duchy, was, absorbed, into, the, russian, empire, as, a, semi, autonomous, congress, poland, in, 1815, poland, did, not, become, a, sovereign, state, again, until, 1918, following, the, collapse, of, the, neighbouring, russian, german, and, austro, hungarian, empires, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, i, napoleon, s, impact, on, poland, was, significant, including, the, napoleonic, legal, code, the, abolition, of, serfdom, and, the, introduction, of, modern, middle, class, bureaucracies, the, iberian, conflict, began, when, portugal, continued, trade, with, britain, despite, french, restrictions, when, spain, failed, to, maintain, the, continental, system, the, uneasy, spanish, alliance, with, france, ended, in, all, but, name, french, troops, gradually, encroached, on, spanish, territory, until, they, occupied, madrid, and, installed, a, client, monarchy, this, provoked, an, explosion, of, popular, rebellions, across, spain, heavy, british,

the, heavily, out, numbered, british, army, from, the, iberian, peninsula, battle, of, corunna, 16, january, 1809, but, when, he, left, the, guerrilla, war, against, his, forces, in, the, countryside, continued, to, tie, down, great, numbers, of, troops, the, outbreak, of, the, war, of, the, fifth, coalition, prevented, napoleon, from, successfully, wrapping, up, operations, against, british, forces, by, necessitating, his, departure, for, austria, and, he, never, returned, to, the, peninsular, theatre, the, british, then, sent, in, a, fresh, army, under, sir, arthur, wellesley, later, the, duke, of, wellington, for, a, time, the, british, and, portuguese, remained, restricted, to, the, area, around, lisbon, behind, their, impregnable, lines, of, torres, vedras, while, their, spanish, allies, were, besieged, in, c, diz, the, peninsular, war, proved, a, major, disaster, for, france, napoleon, did, well, when, he, was, in, direct, charge, but, severe, losses, followed, his, departure, as, he, severely, underestimated, how, much, manpower, would, be, needed, the, effort, in, spain, was, a, drain, on, money, manpower, and, prestige, historian, david, gates, called, it, the, spanish, ulcer, napoleon, realised, it, had, been, a, disaster, for, his, cause, writing, later, that, unfortunate, war, destroyed, me, all, the, circumstances, of, my, disasters, are, bound, up, in, that, fatal, knot, the, peninsular, campaigns, witnessed, 60, major, battles, and, 30, major, sieges, more, than, any, other, of, the, napoleonic, conflicts, and, lasted, over, 6, years, far, longer, than, any, of, the, others, france, and, her, allies, lost, at, least, 91, 000, killed, in, action, and, 237, 000, wounded, in, the, peninsula, from, 1812, the, peninsular, war, merged, with,

included, battles, of, raszyn, eckmuhl, raab, aspern, essling, and, wagram, on, land, the, fifth, coalition, attempted, few, extensive, military, endeavours, one, the, walcheren, expedition, of, 1809, involved, a, dual, effort, by, the, british, army, and, the, royal, navy, to, relieve, austrian, forces, under, intense, french, pressure, it, ended, in, disaster, after, the, army, commander, john, pitt, 2nd, earl, of, chatham, failed, to, capture, the, objective, the, naval, base, of, french, controlled, antwerp, for, the, most, part, of, the, years, of, the, fifth, coalition, british, military, operations, on, land, apart, from, the, iberian, peninsula, remained, restricted, to, hit, and, run, operations, executed, by, the, royal, navy, which, dominated, the, sea, after, having, beaten, down, almost, all, substantial, naval, opposition, from, france, and, its, allies, and, blockading, what, remained, of, france, s, naval, forces, in, heavily, fortified, french, controlled, ports, these, rapid, attack, operations, were, aimed, mostly, at, destroying, blockaded, french, naval, and, mercantile, shipping, and, the, disruption, of, french, supplies, communications, and, military, units, stationed, near, the, coasts, often, when, british, allies, attempted, military, actions, within, several, dozen, miles, or, so, of, the, sea, the, royal, navy, would, arrive, land,

royal, navy, sometimes, failed, to, achieve, its, objectives, because, of, the, lack, of, manpower, that, the, navy, s, guerrilla, allies, had, promised, to, supply, austria, achieved, some, initial, victories, against, the, thinly, spread, army, of, marshal, berthier, napoleon, left, berthier, with, only, 170, 000, men, to, defend, france, s, entire, eastern, frontier, in, the, 1790s, 800, 000,

on, 19, april, 1809, the, army, of, the, duchy, of, warsaw, captured, west, galicia, following, its, earlier, success, napoleon, assumed, personal, command, and, bolstered, the, army, for, a, counter, attack, on, austria, after, a, few, small, battles, the, well, run, campaign, forced, the, austrians, to, withdraw, from, bavaria, and, napoleon, advanced, into, austria, his, hurried, attempt, to, cross, the, danube, resulted, in, the, major, battle, of, aspern, essling, 22, may, 1809, napoleon, s, first, significant, tactical, defeat, but, the, austrian, commander, archduke, charles, failed, to, follow, up, on, his, indecisive, victory, allowing, napoleon, to, prepare, and, seize, vienna, in, early, july, he, defeated, the, austrians, at, wagram, on, 5, 6, july, it, was, during, the, middle, of, that, battle, that, marshal, bernadotte, was, stripped, of, his, command, after, retreating, contrary, to, napoleon, s, orders, shortly, thereafter, bernadotte, took, up, the, offer, from, sweden, to, fill, the, vacant, position, of, crown, prince, there, later, he, actively, participated, in, wars, against, his, former, emperor, the, war, of, the, fifth, coalition, ended, with, the,

november, 1809, in, the, west, the, peninsular, war, continued, economic, warfare, between, britain, and, france, continued, the, british, continued, a, naval, blockade, of, french, controlled, territory, due, to, military, shortages, and, lack, of, organisation, in, french, territory, many, breaches, of, the, continental, system, occurred, and, the, french, continental, system, was, largely, ineffective, and, did, little, economic, damage, to, great, britain, both, sides, entered, further, conflicts, in, attempts, to, enforce, their, blockade, as, napoleon, realised, that, extensive, trade, was, going, through, spain, and, russia, he, invaded, those, two, countries, the, british, fought, the, united, states, in, the, war, of, 1812, 1812, 1815, in, 1810, the, french,

ois, bastien, s, bastiani, de, la, porta, played, a, very, important, role, in, provoking, the, war, which, were, a, proxy, conflict, of, the, coalition, wars, having, most, of, the, time, serbs, revolutionaries, the, support, of, the, russian, empire, while, the, ottoman, empire, was, an, ally, of, the, french, empire, this, was, due, to, the, fact, that, both, empires, feared, napoleon, s, moves, to, the, east, as, the, subsequent, peace, of, pressburg, brought, france, into, balkan, affairs, the, most, radical, and, liberal, rebels, were, also, inspired, in, some, way, by, the, french, revolution, specially, the, rise, of, nationalism, and, the, autonomy, of, the, illyrian, provinces, serbs, initially, felt, that, french, presence, in, the, region, could, have, developed, into, military, aid, in, support, of, the, insurrection, against, ottoman, rule, as, a, sister, republic, but, napoleon, didn, t, want, to, increase, russian, or, austrian, influence, in, the, region, during, the, first, phase, from, 1804, to, 1806, it, was, a, conservative, reaction, to, new, abuses, by, the, janissaries, and, dahis, after, they, killed, hadyi, mustafa, pasha, vizier, of, the, sanjak, of, smederevo, he, created, a, militia, of, serb, notables, and, realized, the, slaughter, of, the, knezes, because, the, janissaries, expelled, from, belgrade, found, refuge, with, osman, pazvanto, lu, governor, of, the, sanjak, of, vidin, in, present, day, bulgaria, who, pursued, his, own, policy, and, sought, independence, which, brought, him, into, conflict, with, the, serbs, and, later, with, the, sublime, porte, thus, the, serbs, appealed, to, sultan, selim, iii, for, assistance, against, the, dahis, who, had, since, rejected, the, authority, of, the, porte, also, kara, or, e, negotiated, with, the, austrian, captain, sajtinski, at, this, meeting, he, expressed, the, wish, of, the, serbian, people, that, the, austrian, empire, receive, him, as, a, kingdom, under, his, protection, like, in, the, past, as, occupation, of, 1788, 1791, was, still, a, fresh, memory, however, the, austrian, authorities, due, to, difficulties, with, napoleon, and, because, they, wanted, to, maintain, their, neutrality, in, order, to, be, correct, with, the, porte, could, not, accept, his, offers, so, the, serbs, were, forced, to, ask, for, the, protection, of, the, russians, and, therefore, on, may, 3, 1804, the, serb, leaders, sent, a, letter, to, the, russian, envoy, in, constantinople, in, which, they, spoke, of, the, problems, and, wishes, of, the, serbian, people, but, they, also, stressed, that, they, would, continue, to, be, loyal, to, the, sultan, due, to, the, recent, russo, ottoman, alliance, against, france, s, expanding, influence, in, the, balkans, the, approach, of, french, troops, to, the, turkish, territories, like, occupation, of, corfu, and, other, ionian, islands, in, 1797, 99, influenced, the, porte, to, conclude, an, alliance, with, russia, in, 1798, the, russian, government, had, a, neutral, policy, toward, the, serbian, revolt, until, summer, 1804, in, which, the, goal, was, now, to, having, constantinople, recognize, russia, as, the, guarantor, of, peace, in, the, region, in, 1806, the, serbs, rejected, i, ko, s, peace, the, ottomans, seemed, ready, to, grant, serbia, autonomy, similar, to, that, enjoyed, by, neighbouring, wallachia, in, order, to, enter, in, the, napoleonic, wars, as, an, ally, of, the, french, as, they, desired, russian, support, for, their, independence, starting, a, new, phase, of, the, uprising, in, which, the, serbs, planned, to, create, their, own, national, state, which, would, also, include, the, territories, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, as, well, as, the, pashaliks, of, vidin, nis, leskovac, and, pazar, also, in, the, traditionalist, circles, of, serbia, rebels, petar, i, of, montenegro, developed, a, plan, in, 1807, to, restore, the, medieval, serbian, empire, slaveno, serb, empire, consisting, on, unify, podgorica, spu, abljak, the, bay, of, kotor, bosnia, herzegovina, dubrovnik, and, dalmatia, with, montenegro, which, he, informed, the, russian, court, and, was, also, viewed, by, habsburg, serb, metropolitan, stefan, stratimirovi, the, title, of, emperor, of, the, serbs, would, be, held, by, the, russian, emperor, as, tsar, but, with, the, condition, that, russians, respected, the, independence, autocephaly, of, the, montenegrin, orthodox, church, so, in, february, 1807, petar, i, planned, an, invasion, of, herzegovina, by, montenegrin, forces, and, asked, for, kara, or, e, s, aid, wanting, to, connect, the, territory, occupied, by, the, serbian, rebel, forces, and, montenegro, which, succeeded, after, the, battle, of, suvodol, in, 1809, this, support, of, montenegro, for, the, serbs, was, reinforced, due, to, the, fact, that, in, the, war, of, 1807, 1812, ottoman, troops, supported, by, french, detachments, on, illyria, attacked, montenegro, along, the, entire, border, and, the, montenegrins, did, not, have, time, to, repel, all, the, attacks, however, they, managed, to, force, the, french, troops, to, withdraw, from, dubrovnik, and, conquered, the, bay, of, kotor, napoleon, himself, offered, petar, i, the, title, patriarch, of, the, entire, serbian, nation, or, of, the, entire, illyricum, on, the, condition, that, he, cease, cooperation, with, russia, and, accept, a, french, protectorate, which, he, refused, for, fear, of, an, eventual, papal, status, jurisdiction, or, an, anti, clerical, policy, however, the, treaty, of, tilsit, between, france, and, russia, against, the, ottomans, helped, put, a, stop, to, hostilities, in, the, balkans, with, a, truce, taking, place, which, was, perceived, extremely, negatively, in, serbia, despite, the, fact, that, the, truce, did, not, apply, to, the, serb, rebels, also, there, was, a, secret, clause, that, provides, for, the, division, of, turkish, possessions, in, the, balkans, between, russia, and, france, and, the, cancellation, of, the, slaveno, serb, empire, project, in, 1809, kara, or, e, appealed, to, an, alliance, with, the, habsburgs, and, napoleon, with, no, success, even, wrote, personally, to, napoleon, seeking, military, assistance, and, in, 1810, dispatched, an, emissary, to, french, empire, however, the, french, did, not, believe, that, the, rebels, had, the, military, capacity, to, defeat, the, ottomans, or, expulse, them, from, the, balkans, in, 1812, under, pressure, from, napoleon, russia, was, forced, to, sign, the, treaty, of, bucharest, which, restored, peace, with, the, ottomans, one, of, the, clauses, of, the, treaty, provided, for, the, maintenance, of, serbian, autonomy, also, a, truce, was, signed, according, to, the, article, 8, of, the, treaty, then, the, russians, encouraged, kara, or, e, and, his, followers, to, negotiate, directly, with, the, porte, the, war, of, 1812, coincided, with, the, war, of, the, sixth, coalition, historians, in, the, united, states, and, canada, see, it, as, a, war, in, its, own, right, while, europeans, often, see, it, as, a, minor, theatre, of, the, napoleonic, wars, the, united, states, declared, war, on, britain, because, of, british, military, support, for, native, americans, interference, with, american, merchant, ships, forced, enlistment, of, american, sailors, into, the, royal, navy, and, a, desire, to, expand, its, territory, france, had, interfered, as, well, and, the, united, states, had, considered, declaring, war, on, france, the, war, ended, in, a, military, stalemate, and, there, were, no, boundary, changes, at, the, treaty, of, ghent, which, took, effect, in, early, 1815, when, napoleon, was, on, elba, the, abdication, of, kings, charles, iv, of, spain, and, ferdinand, vii, of, spain, and, the, installation, of, napoleon, s, brother, as, king, jos, provoked, civil, wars, and, revolutions, leading, to, the, independence, of, most, of, spain, s, mainland, american, colonies, in, spanish, america, many, local, elites, formed, juntas, and, set, up, mechanisms, to, rule, in, the, name, of, ferdinand, vii, whom, they, considered, the, legitimate, spanish, monarch, the, outbreak, of, the, spanish, american, wars, of, independence, in, most, of, the, empire, was, a, result, of, napoleon, s, destabilizing, actions, in, spain, and, led, to, the, rise, of, strongmen, in, the, wake, of, these, wars, the, defeat, of, napoleon, at, waterloo, in, 1815, caused, an, exodus, of, french, soldiers, into, latin, america, where, they, joined, ranks, with, the, armies, of, the, independence, movements, while, these, officials, had, a, role, in, various, victories, such, as, the, capture, of, valdivia, 1820, some, are, held, responsible, for, significant, defeats, at, the, hands, of, the, royalists, as, was, the, case, at, the, second, battle, of, cancha, rayada, 1818, in, contrast, the, portuguese, royal, family, escaped, to, brazil, and, established, the, court, there, resulting, in, political, stability, for, portuguese, america, in, 1816, brazil, was, proclaimed, an, equal, part, of, the, united, kingdom, of, portugal, brazil, and, the, algarves, paving, the, way, to, brazilian, independence, six, years, later, the, haitian, revolution, began, in, 1791, just, before, the, french, revolutionary, wars, and, continued, until, 1804, france, s, defeat, resulted, in, the, independence, of, saint, domingue, and, led, napoleon, to, sell, the, territory, making, up, the, louisiana, purchase, to, the, united, states, during, the, napoleonic, wars, the, united, states, sweden, and, sicily, fought, against, the, barbary, pirates, in, the, mediterranean, the, treaty, of, tilsit, in, 1807, resulted, in, the, anglo, russian, war, 1807, 1812, emperor, alexander, i, declared, war, on, britain, after, the, british, attack, on, denmark, in, september, 1807, british, men, of, war, supported, the, swedish, fleet, during, the, finnish, war, and, won, victories, over, the, russians, in, the, gulf, of, finland, in, july, 1808, and, august, 1809, the, success, of, the, russian, army, on, land, however, forced, sweden, to, sign, peace, treaties, with, russia, in, 1809, and, with, france, in, 1810, and, to, join, the, blockade, against, britain, but, franco, russian, relations, would, become, progressively, worse, after, 1810, and, the, russian, war, with, britain, effectively, ended, in, april, 1812, britain, russia, and, sweden, signed, secret, agreements, directed, against, napoleon, the, central, issue, for, both, napoleon, and, tsar, alexander, i, was, control, over, poland, each, wanted, a, semi, independent, poland, he, could, control, as, esdaile, notes, implicit, in, the, idea, of, a, russian, poland, was, of, course, a, war, against, napoleon, schroeder, says, poland, was, the, root, cause, of, napoleon, s, war, with, russia, but, russia, s, refusal, to, support, the, continental, system, was, also, a, factor, in, 1812, at, the, height, of, his, power, napoleon, invaded, russia, with, a, pan, european, grande, arm, e, consisting, of, 450, 000, men, 200, 000, frenchmen, and, many, soldiers, of, allies, or, subject, areas, the, french, forces, crossed, the, niemen, river, on, 24, june, 1812, russia, proclaimed, a, patriotic, war, and, napoleon, proclaimed, a, second, polish, war, the, poles, supplied, almost, 100, 000, men, for, the, invasion, force, but, against, their, expectations, napoleon, avoided, any, concessions, to, poland, having, in, mind, further, negotiations, with, russia, the, grande, arm, e, marched, through, russia, winning, some, relatively, minor, engagements, and, the, major, battle, of, smolensk, on, 16, 18, august, in, the, same, days, part, of, the, french, army, led, by, marshal, nicolas, oudinot, was, stopped, in, the, battle, of, polotsk, by, the, right, wing, of, the, russian, army, under, command, of, general, peter, wittgenstein, this, prevented, the, french, march, on, the, russian, capital, saint, petersburg, the, fate, of, the, invasion, was, decided, in, moscow, where, napoleon, led, his, forces, in, person, the, main, russian, army, was, commanded, by, field, marshal, michael, andreas, barclay, de, tolly, who, recognized, that, napoleon, s, immediate, goal, was, a, decisive, battle, to, crush, the, main, russian, force, in, the, west, in, response, the, russian, army, used, scorched, earth, tactics, as, it, withdrew, east, and, harried, the, grande, arm, e, with, light, cossack, cavalry, the, grande, arm, e, did, not, adjust, its, operational, methods, in, response, provisioning, such, an, enormous, army, with, adequate, food, and, fresh, water, had, proven, difficult, since, the, very, start, of, the, campaign, exacerbated, by, the, sparse, terrain, of, western, russia, diseases, such, as, typhus, and, dysentery, rapidly, became, rampant, among, the, rank, and, file, these, factors, led, to, most, of, the, losses, of, the, main, column, of, the, grande, arm, e, which, in, one, case, amounted, to, 95, 000, men, including, deserters, in, a, week, the, main, russian, army, retreated, for, almost, three, months, this, constant, retreat, led, to, the, increasing, unpopularity, of, barclay, de, tolly, who, was, a, baltic, german, and, already, mistrusted, by, the, russian, elite, and, a, respected, russian, veteran, prince, mikhail, kutuzov, was, made, the, new, commander, in, chief, by, tsar, alexander, finally, the, two, armies, engaged, in, the, battle, of, borodino, on, 7, september, in, the, vicinity, of, moscow, the, battle, was, the, largest, and, bloodiest, single, day, action, of, the, napoleonic, wars, involving, more, than, 250, 000, men, and, resulting, in, at, least, 70, 000, casualties, the, battle, was, indecisive, the, french, captured, the, main, positions, on, the, battlefield, but, failed, to, destroy, the, russian, army, while, kutuzov, had, recognized, the, political, need, to, give, battle, he, also, recognized, that, barclay, de, tolly, s, strategies, had, proven, effective, and, that, the, grande, arm, e, was, bleeding, personnel, and, supplies, more, and, more, severely, with, every, step, they, took, deeper, into, russia, napoleon, s, logistical, difficulties, meant, that, french, casualties, simply, could, not, be, replaced, whereas, the, russian, army, could, reinforce, itself, far, more, readily, napoleon, entered, moscow, on, 14, september, after, the, russian, army, had, retreated, yet, again, by, then, the, russians, had, largely, evacuated, the, city, and, released, criminals, from, the, prisons, to, inconvenience, the, french, the, governor, count, fyodor, rostopchin, ordered, the, city, to, be, burnt, alexander, i, refused, to, capitulate, and, the, peace, talks, attempted, by, napoleon, failed, rather, than, withdraw, further, east, the, russian, army, withdrew, south, rebuilding, its, strength, and, preparing, to, interfere, with, a, french, withdrawal, in, october, with, no, sign, of, clear, victory, in, sight, napoleon, began, the, disastrous, great, retreat, from, moscow, the, french, tried, to, reach, kaluga, and, swing, through, southern, russia, where, they, could, find, food, and, forage, supplies, in, the, battle, of, maloyaroslavets, the, replenished, russian, army, blocked, the, road, to, kaluga, while, an, indecisive, engagement, it, nevertheless, doomed, the, grande, arm, e, with, the, russians, refusing, to, be, dislodged, napoleon, was, forced, to, retreat, back, down, the, smolensk, road, along, which, he, had, already, advanced, and, which, had, already, been, denuded, of, supplies, most, crucially, food, the, french, supply, chain, already, in, tatters, from, the, attrition, of, wagons, and, horses, began, to, collapse, completely, the, lack, of, horses, also, rendered, napoleon, s, cavalry, ineffective, leaving, the, grande, arm, e, vulnerable, to, sustained, guerrilla, warfare, by, russian, peasants, and, irregular, troops, the, grande, arm, e, was, dealt, a, further, catastrophic, blow, by, the, onset, of, the, russian, winter, which, the, underfed, and, undersupplied, grande, arm, e, was, unprepared, to, cope, with, when, the, remnants, of, napoleon, s, army, struggled, across, the, berezina, river, in, november, with, the, russian, army, in, pursuit, only, 27, 000, fit, soldiers, survived, with, 380, 000, men, dead, or, missing, and, 100, 000, captured, napoleon, then, left, his, men, and, returned, to, paris, to, prepare, the, defence, against, the, advancing, russians, the, campaign, had, effectively, ended, on, 14, december, 1812, when, the, last, enemy, troops, left, russia, the, russians, had, lost, around, 210, 000, men, but, with, their, shorter, supply, lines, they, soon, replenished, their, armies, for, every, six, soldiers, of, the, grande, arm, e, that, entered, russia, only, one, would, make, it, out, in, fighting, condition, seeing, an, opportunity, in, napoleon, s, historic, defeat, prussia, sweden, and, several, other, german, states, switched, sides, joining, russia, the, united, kingdom, and, others, opposing, napoleon, napoleon, vowed, that, he, would, create, a, new, army, as, large, as, the, one, he, had, sent, into, russia, and, quickly, built, up, his, forces, in, the, east, from, 30, 000, to, 130, 000, and, eventually, to, 400, 000, napoleon, inflicted, 40, 000, casualties, on, the, allies, at, l, tzen, 2, may, 1813, and, bautzen, 20, 21, may, 1813, both, battles, involved, forces, of, over, 250, 000, making, them, some, of, the, largest, conflicts, of, the, wars, so, far, klemens, von, metternich, in, november, 1813, offered, napoleon, the, frankfurt, proposals, they, would, allow, napoleon, to, remain, emperor, but, france, would, be, reduced, to, its, natural, frontiers, and, lose, control, of, most, of, italy, and, germany, and, the, netherlands, napoleon, still, expected, to, win, the, wars, and, rejected, the, terms, by, 1814, as, the, allies, were, closing, in, on, paris, napoleon, did, agree, to, the, frankfurt, proposals, but, it, was, too, late, and, he, rejected, the, new, harsher, terms, proposed, by, the, allies, in, the, peninsular, war, arthur, wellesley, 1st, duke, of, wellington, renewed, the, anglo, portuguese, advance, into, spain, just, after, new, year, in, 1812, besieging, and, capturing, the, fortified, towns, of, ciudad, rodrigo, badajoz, and, crushing, a, french, army, at, the, battle, of, salamanca, as, the, french, regrouped, the, anglo, portuguese, entered, madrid, and, advanced, towards, burgos, before, retreating, all, the, way, to, portugal, when, renewed, french, concentrations, threatened, to, trap, them, as, a, consequence, of, the, salamanca, campaign, the, french, were, forced, to, end, their, long, siege, of, c, diz, and, to, permanently, evacuate, the, provinces, of, andalusia, and, asturias, in, a, strategic, move, wellesley, planned, to, move, his, supply, base, from, lisbon, to, santander, the, anglo, portuguese, forces, swept, northwards, in, late, may, and, seized, burgos, on, 21, june, at, vitoria, the, combined, anglo, portuguese, and, spanish, armies, won, against, joseph, bonaparte, finally, breaking, french, power, in, spain, the, french, had, to, retreat, from, the, iberian, peninsula, over, the, pyrenees, the, belligerents, declared, an, armistice, from, 4, june, 1813, continuing, until, 13, august, during, which, time, both, sides, attempted, to, recover, from, the, loss, of, approximately, a, quarter, of, a, million, men, in, the, preceding, two, months, during, this, time, coalition, negotiations, finally, brought, austria, out, in, open, opposition, to, france, two, principal, austrian, armies, took, the, field, adding, 300, 000, men, to, the, coalition, armies, in, germany, the, allies, now, had, around, 800, 000, front, line, soldiers, in, the, german, theatre, with, a, strategic, reserve, of, 350, 000, formed, to, support, the, front, line, operations, napoleon, succeeded, in, bringing, the, imperial, forces, in, the, region, to, around, 650, 000, although, only, 250, 000, came, under, his, direct, command, with, another, 120, 000, under, nicolas, charles, oudinot, and, 30, 000, under, davout, the, remaining, imperial, forces, came, mostly, from, the, confederation, of, the, rhine, especially, saxony, and, bavaria, in, addition, to, the, south, murat, s, kingdom, of, naples, and, eug, ne, de, beauharnais, s, kingdom, of, italy, had, 100, 000, armed, men, in, spain, another, 150, 000, to, 200, 000, french, troops, steadily, retreated, before, anglo, portuguese, forces, numbering, around, 100, 000, thus, around, 900, 000, frenchmen, in, all, theatres, faced, around, 1, 800, 000, coalition, soldiers, including, the, strategic, reserve, under, formation, in, germany, the, gross, figures, may, mislead, slightly, as, most, of, the, german, troops, fighting, on, the, side, of, the, french, fought, at, best, unreliably, and, stood, on, the, verge, of, defecting, to, the, allies, one, can, reasonably, say, that, napoleon, could, count, on, no, more, than, 450, 000, men, in, germany, which, left, him, outnumbered, about, four, to, one, following, the, end, of, the, armistice, napoleon, seemed, to, have, regained, the, initiative, at, dresden, august, 1813, where, he, once, again, defeated, a, numerically, superior, coalition, army, and, inflicted, enormous, casualties, while, sustaining, relatively, few, the, failures, of, his, marshals, and, a, slow, resumption, of, the, offensive, on, his, part, cost, him, any, advantage, that, this, victory, might, have, secured, at, the, battle, of, leipzig, in, saxony, 16, 19, october, 1813, also, called, the, battle, of, the, nations, 191, 000, french, fought, more, than, 300, 000, allies, and, the, defeated, french, had, to, retreat, into, france, after, the, french, withdrawal, from, germany, napoleon, s, remaining, ally, denmark, norway, became, isolated, and, fell, to, the, coalition, napoleon, then, fought, a, series, of, battles, in, france, including, the, battle, of, arcis, sur, aube, but, the, overwhelming, numbers, of, the, allies, steadily, forced, him, back, the, allies, entered, paris, on, 30, march, 1814, during, this, time, napoleon, fought, his, six, days, campaign, in, which, he, won, many, battles, against, the, enemy, forces, advancing, towards, paris, during, this, entire, campaign, he, never, managed, to, field, more, than, 70, 000, men, against, more, than, half, a, million, coalition, soldiers, at, the, treaty, of, chaumont, 9, march, 1814, the, allies, agreed, to, preserve, the, coalition, until, napoleon, s, total, defeat, napoleon, determined, to, fight, on, even, now, incapable, of, fathoming, his, fall, from, power, during, the, campaign, he, had, issued, a, decree, for, 900, 000, fresh, conscripts, but, only, a, fraction, of, these, materialised, and, napoleon, s, schemes, for, victory, eventually, gave, way, to, the, reality, of, his, hopeless, situation, napoleon, abdicated, on, 6, april, occasional, military, actions, continued, in, italy, spain, and, holland, in, early, 1814, an, armistice, was, signed, with, the, allied, powers, on, 23, april, 1814, the, first, treaty, of, paris, signed, on, 30, may, 1814, officially, ended, the, war, of, the, sixth, coalition, the, victors, exiled, napoleon, to, the, island, of, elba, and, restored, the, french, bourbon, monarchy, in, the, person, of, louis, xviii, they, signed, the, treaty, of, fontainebleau, 11, april, 1814, and, initiated, the, congress, of, vienna, to, redraw, the, map, of, europe, the, seventh, coalition, 1815, pitted, britain, russia, prussia, sweden, switzerland, austria, the, netherlands, and, several, smaller, german, states, against, france, the, period, known, as, the, hundred, days, began, after, napoleon, escaped, from, elba, and, landed, at, cannes, 1, march, 1815, travelling, to, paris, picking, up, support, as, he, went, he, eventually, overthrew, louis, xviii, the, allies, rapidly, gathered, their, armies, to, meet, him, again, napoleon, raised, 280, 000, men, whom, he, distributed, among, several, armies, to, add, to, the, 90, 000, strong, standing, army, he, recalled, well, over, a, quarter, of, a, million, veterans, from, past, campaigns, and, issued, a, decree, for, the, eventual, draft, of, around, 2, 5, million, new, men, into, the, french, army, which, was, never, achieved, this, faced, an, initial, coalition, force, of, about, 700, 000, although, coalition, campaign, plans, provided, for, one, million, front, line, soldiers, supported, by, around, 200, 000, garrison, logistics, and, other, auxiliary, personnel, napoleon, took, about, 124, 000, men, of, the, army, of, the, north, on, a, pre, emptive, strike, against, the, allies, in, belgium, he, intended, to, attack, the, coalition, armies, before, they, combined, in, hope, of, driving, the, british, into, the, sea, and, the, prussians, out, of, the, war, his, march, to, the, frontier, achieved, the, surprise, he, had, planned, catching, the, anglo, dutch, army, in, a, dispersed, arrangement, the, prussians, had, been, more, wary, concentrating, 75, per, cent, of, their, army, in, and, around, ligny, the, prussians, forced, the, arm, e, du, nord, to, fight, all, the, day, of, the, 15th, to, reach, ligny, in, a, delaying, action, by, the, prussian, 1st, corps, he, forced, prussia, to, fight, at, ligny, on, 16, june, 1815, and, the, defeated, prussians, retreated, in, disorder, on, the, same, day, the, left, wing, of, the, arm, e, du, nord, under, the, command, of, marshal, michel, ney, succeeded, in, stopping, any, of, wellington, s, forces, going, to, aid, bl, cher, s, prussians, by, fighting, a, blocking, action, at, quatre, bras, ney, failed, to, clear, the, cross, roads, and, wellington, reinforced, the, position, but, with, the, prussian, retreat, wellington, too, had, to, retreat, he, fell, back, to, a, previously, reconnoitred, position, on, an, escarpment, at, mont, st, jean, a, few, miles, south, of, the, village, of, waterloo, napoleon, took, the, reserve, of, the, army, of, the, north, and, reunited, his, forces, with, those, of, ney, to, pursue, wellington, s, army, after, he, ordered, marshal, grouchy, to, take, the, right, wing, of, the, army, of, the, north, and, stop, the, prussians, regrouping, in, the, first, of, a, series, of, miscalculations, both, grouchy, and, napoleon, failed, to, realise, that, the, prussian, forces, were, already, reorganised, and, were, assembling, at, the, city, of, wavre, the, french, army, did, nothing, to, stop, a, rather, leisurely, retreat, that, took, place, throughout, the, night, and, into, the, early, morning, by, the, prussians, as, the, 4th, 1st, and, 2nd, prussian, corps, marched, through, the, town, towards, waterloo, the, 3rd, prussian, corps, took, up, blocking, positions, across, the, river, and, although, grouchy, engaged, and, defeated, the, prussian, rearguard, under, the, command, of, lt, gen, von, thielmann, in, the, battle, of, wavre, 18, 19, june, it, was, 12, hours, too, late, in, the, end, 17, 000, prussians, had, kept, 33, 000, badly, needed, french, reinforcements, off, the, field, napoleon, delayed, the, start, of, fighting, at, the, battle, of, waterloo, on, the, morning, of, 18, june, for, several, hours, while, he, waited, for, the, ground, to, dry, after, the, previous, night, s, rain, by, late, afternoon, the, french, army, had, not, succeeded, in, driving, wellington, s, forces, from, the, escarpment, on, which, they, stood, when, the, prussians, arrived, and, attacked, the, french, right, flank, in, ever, increasing, numbers, napoleon, s, strategy, of, keeping, the, coalition, armies, divided, had, failed, and, a, combined, coalition, general, advance, drove, his, army, from, the, field, in, confusion, grouchy, organised, a, successful, and, well, ordered, retreat, towards, paris, where, marshal, davout, had, 117, 000, men, ready, to, turn, back, the, 116, 000, men, of, bl, cher, and, wellington, general, vandamme, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, issy, and, negotiations, for, surrender, had, begun, on, arriving, at, paris, three, days, after, waterloo, napoleon, still, clung, to, the, hope, of, a, concerted, national, resistance, but, the, temper, of, the, legislative, chambers, and, of, the, public, generally, did, not, favour, his, view, lacking, support, napoleon, abdicated, again, on, 22, june, 1815, and, on, 15, july, he, surrendered, to, the, british, squadron, at, rochefort, the, allies, exiled, him, to, the, remote, south, atlantic, island, of, saint, helena, where, he, died, on, 5, may, 1821, in, italy, joachim, murat, whom, the, allies, had, allowed, to, remain, king, of, naples, after, napoleon, s, initial, defeat, once, again, allied, with, his, brother, in, law, triggering, the, neapolitan, war, march, to, may, 1815, hoping, to, find, support, among, italian, nationalists, fearing, the, increasing, influence, of, the, habsburgs, in, italy, murat, issued, the, rimini, proclamation, inciting, them, to, war, the, proclamation, failed, and, the, austrians, soon, crushed, murat, at, the, battle, of, tolentino, 2, 3, may, 1815, forcing, him, to, flee, the, bourbons, returned, to, the, throne, of, naples, on, 20, may, 1815, murat, tried, to, regain, his, throne, but, after, that, failed, he, was, executed, by, firing, squad, on, 13, october, 1815, the, second, treaty, of, paris, signed, on, 20, november, 1815, officially, marked, the, end, of, the, napoleonic, wars, the, napoleonic, wars, brought, radical, changes, to, europe, but, the, reactionary, forces, returned, and, restored, the, bourbon, house, to, the, french, throne, napoleon, had, succeeded, in, bringing, most, of, western, europe, under, one, rule, in, most, european, countries, subjugation, in, the, french, empire, brought, with, it, many, liberal, features, of, the, french, revolution, including, democracy, due, process, in, courts, abolition, of, serfdom, reduction, of, the, power, of, the, catholic, church, and, demand, for, constitutional, limits, on, monarchs, the, increasing, voice, of, the, middle, classes, with, rising, commerce, and, industry, meant, that, restored, european, monarchs, found, it, difficult, to, restore, pre, revolutionary, absolutism, and, had, to, retain, many, of, the, reforms, enacted, during, napoleon, s, rule, institutional, legacies, remain, to, this, day, in, the, form, of, civil, law, with, clearly, defined, codes, of, law, an, enduring, legacy, of, the, napoleonic, code, france, s, constant, warfare, with, the, combined, forces, of, different, combinations, of, and, eventually, all, of, the, other, major, powers, of, europe, for, over, two, decades, finally, took, its, toll, by, the, end, of, the, napoleonic, wars, france, no, longer, held, the, role, of, the, dominant, power, in, continental, europe, as, it, had, since, the, times, of, louis, xiv, as, the, congress, of, vienna, produced, a, balance, of, power, by, resizing, the, main, powers, so, they, could, balance, each, other, and, remain, at, peace, in, this, regard, prussia, was, restored, in, its, former, borders, and, also, received, large, chunks, of, poland, and, saxony, greatly, enlarged, prussia, became, a, permanent, great, power, in, order, to, drag, prussia, s, attention, towards, the, west, and, france, the, congress, also, gave, the, rhineland, and, westphalia, to, prussia, these, industrial, regions, transformed, agrarian, prussia, into, an, industrial, leader, in, the, nineteenth, century, britain, emerged, as, the, most, important, economic, power, and, its, royal, navy, held, unquestioned, naval, superiority, across, the, globe, well, into, the, 20th, century, after, the, napoleonic, period, nationalism, a, relatively, new, movement, became, increasingly, significant, this, shaped, much, of, the, course, of, future, european, history, its, growth, spelled, the, beginning, of, some, states, and, the, end, of, others, as, the, map, of, europe, changed, dramatically, in, the, hundred, years, following, the, napoleonic, era, rule, by, fiefdoms, and, aristocracy, was, widely, replaced, by, national, ideologies, based, on, shared, origins, and, culture, bonaparte, s, reign, over, europe, sowed, the, seeds, for, the, founding, of, the, nation, states, of, germany, and, italy, by, starting, the, process, of, consolidating, city, states, kingdoms, and, principalities, at, the, end, of, the, war, denmark, was, forced, to, cede, norway, to, sweden, mainly, as, a, compensation, for, the, loss, of, finland, which, the, other, coalition, members, agreed, to, but, because, norway, had, signed, its, own, constitution, on, 17, may, 1814, sweden, initiated, the, swedish, norwegian, war, 1814, the, war, was, a, short, one, taking, place, between, 26, july, 14, august, 1814, and, was, a, swedish, victory, that, put, norway, into, a, personal, union, with, sweden, the, union, was, peacefully, dissolved, in, 1905, the, united, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, created, as, a, buffer, state, against, france, dissolved, rapidly, with, the, independence, of, belgium, in, 1830, the, napoleonic, wars, also, played, a, key, role, in, the, independence, of, the, latin, american, colonies, from, spain, and, portugal, the, conflict, weakened, the, authority, and, military, power, of, spain, especially, after, the, battle, of, trafalgar, there, were, many, uprisings, in, spanish, america, leading, to, the, wars, of, independence, in, portuguese, america, brazil, experienced, greater, autonomy, as, it, now, served, as, seat, of, the, portuguese, empire, and, ascended, politically, to, the, status, of, kingdom, these, events, also, contributed, to, the, portuguese, liberal, revolution, in, 1820, and, the, independence, of, brazil, in, 1822, the, century, of, relative, transatlantic, peace, after, the, congress, of, vienna, enabled, the, greatest, intercontinental, migration, in, human, history, beginning, with, a, big, spurt, of, immigration, after, the, release, of, the, dam, erected, by, the, napoleonic, wars, immigration, inflows, relative, to, the, us, population, rose, to, record, levels, peaking, at, 1, 6, per, cent, in, 1850, 51, as, 30, million, europeans, relocated, to, the, united, states, between, 1815, and, 1914, another, concept, emerged, from, the, congress, of, vienna, that, of, a, unified, europe, after, his, defeat, napoleon, deplored, the, fact, that, his, dream, of, a, free, and, peaceful, european, association, remained, unaccomplished, such, a, european, association, would, share, the, same, principles, of, government, system, of, measurement, currency, and, civil, code, one, and, a, half, centuries, later, and, after, two, world, wars, several, of, these, ideals, re, emerged, in, the, form, of, the, european, union, until, the, time, of, napoleon, european, states, employed, relatively, small, armies, made, up, of, both, national, soldiers, and, mercenaries, these, regulars, were, highly, drilled, professional, soldiers, ancien, r, gime, armies, could, only, deploy, small, field, armies, due, to, rudimentary, staffs, and, comprehensive, yet, cumbersome, logistics, both, issues, combined, to, limit, field, forces, to, approximately, 30, 000, men, under, a, single, commander, military, innovators, in, the, mid, 18th, century, began, to, recognise, the, potential, of, an, entire, nation, at, war, a, nation, in, arms, the, scale, of, warfare, dramatically, enlarged, during, the, revolutionary, and, subsequent, napoleonic, wars, during, europe, s, major, pre, revolutionary, war, the, seven, years, war, of, 1756, 1763, few, armies, ever, numbered, more, than, 200, 000, with, field, forces, often, numbering, less, than, 30, 000, the, french, innovations, of, separate, corps, allowing, a, single, commander, to, efficiently, command, more, than, the, traditional, command, span, of, 30, 000, men, and, living, off, the, land, which, allowed, field, armies, to, deploy, more, men, without, requiring, an, equal, increase, in, supply, arrangements, such, as, depots, and, supply, trains, allowed, the, french, republic, to, field, much, larger, armies, than, their, opponents, napoleon, ensured, during, the, time, of, the, french, republic, that, separate, french, field, armies, operated, as, a, single, army, under, his, control, often, allowing, him, to, substantially, outnumber, his, opponents, this, forced, his, continental, opponents, to, also, increase, the, size, of, their, armies, moving, away, from, the, traditional, small, well, drilled, ancien, r, gime, armies, of, the, 18th, century, to, mass, conscript, armies, the, battle, of, marengo, which, largely, ended, the, war, of, the, second, coalition, was, fought, with, fewer, than, 60, 000, men, on, both, sides, the, battle, of, austerlitz, which, ended, the, war, of, the, third, coalition, involved, fewer, than, 160, 000, men, the, battle, of, friedland, which, led, to, peace, with, russia, in, 1807, involved, about, 150, 000, men, after, these, defeats, the, continental, powers, developed, various, forms, of, mass, conscription, to, allow, them, to, face, france, on, even, terms, and, the, size, of, field, armies, increased, rapidly, the, battle, of, wagram, of, 1809, involved, 300, 000, men, and, 500, 000, fought, at, leipzig, in, 1813, of, whom, 150, 000, were, killed, or, wounded, about, a, million, french, soldiers, became, casualties, wounded, invalided, or, killed, a, higher, proportion, than, in, the, first, world, war, the, european, total, may, have, reached, 5, 000, 000, military, deaths, including, disease, france, had, the, second, largest, population, in, europe, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, 28, million, as, compared, to, britain, s, 12, million, and, russia, s, 35, to, 40, million, it, was, well, poised, to, take, advantage, of, the, lev, e, en, masse, before, napoleon, s, efforts, lazare, carnot, played, a, large, part, in, the, reorganisation, of, the, french, revolutionary, army, from, 1793, to, 1794, a, time, which, saw, previous, french, misfortunes, reversed, with, republican, armies, advancing, on, all, fronts, the, french, army, peaked, in, size, in, the, 1790s, with, 1, 5, million, frenchmen, enlisted, although, battlefield, strength, was, much, less, haphazard, bookkeeping, rudimentary, medical, support, and, lax, recruitment, standards, ensured, that, many, soldiers, either, never, existed, fell, ill, or, were, unable, to, withstand, the, physical, demands, of, soldiering, about, 2, 8, million, frenchmen, fought, on, land, and, about, 150, 000, at, sea, bringing, the, total, for, france, to, almost, 3, million, combatants, during, almost, 25, years, of, warfare, britain, had, 750, 000, men, under, arms, between, 1792, and, 1815, as, its, army, expanded, from, 40, 000, men, in, 1793, to, a, peak, of, 250, 000, men, in, 1813, over, 250, 000, sailors, served, in, the, royal, navy, in, september, 1812, russia, had, 900, 000, enlisted, men, in, its, army, and, between, 1799, and, 1815, 2, 1, million, men, served, in, its, army, another, 200, 000, served, in, the, imperial, russian, navy, out, of, the, 900, 000, men, the, field, armies, deployed, against, france, numbered, less, than, 250, 000, there, are, no, consistent, statistics, for, other, major, combatants, austria, s, forces, peaked, at, about, 576, 000, during, the, war, of, the, sixth, coalition, and, had, little, or, no, naval, component, yet, never, fielded, more, than, 250, 000, men, in, field, armies, after, britain, austria, proved, the, most, persistent, enemy, of, france, more, than, a, million, austrians, served, during, the, long, wars, its, large, army, was, overall, quite, homogeneous, and, solid, and, in, 1813, operated, in, germany, 140, 000, men, italy, and, the, balkans, 90, 000, men, at, its, peak, about, 50, 000, men, during, most, of, the, campaigning, on, these, fronts, austria, s, manpower, was, becoming, quite, limited, towards, the, end, of, the, wars, leading, its, generals, to, favour, cautious, and, conservative, strategies, to, limit, their, losses, prussia, never, had, more, than, 320, 000, men, under, arms, at, any, time, in, 1813, 1815, the, core, of, its, army, about, 100, 000, men, was, characterised, by, competence, and, determination, but, the, bulk, of, its, forces, consisted, of, second, and, third, line, troops, as, well, as, militiamen, of, variable, strength, many, of, these, troops, performed, reasonably, well, and, often, displayed, considerable, bravery, but, lacked, the, professionalism, of, their, regular, counterparts, and, were, not, as, well, equipped, others, were, largely, unfit, for, operations, except, sieges, during, the, 1813, campaign, 130, 000, men, were, used, in, the, military, operations, with, 100, 000, effectively, participating, in, the, main, german, campaign, and, about, 30, 000, being, used, to, besiege, isolated, french, garrisons, spain, s, armies, also, peaked, at, around, 200, 000, men, not, including, more, than, 50, 000, guerrillas, scattered, over, spain, in, addition, the, maratha, empire, the, ottoman, empire, italy, naples, and, the, duchy, of, warsaw, each, had, more, than, 100, 000, men, under, arms, even, small, nations, now, had, armies, rivalling, the, size, of, the, great, powers, forces, of, past, wars, but, most, of, these, were, poor, quality, forces, only, suitable, for, garrison, duties, the, size, of, their, combat, forces, remained, modest, yet, they, could, still, provide, a, welcome, addition, to, the, major, powers, the, percentage, of, french, troops, in, the, grande, arm, e, which, napoleon, led, into, russia, was, about, 50, per, cent, while, the, french, allies, also, provided, a, significant, contribution, to, the, french, forces, in, spain, as, these, small, nations, joined, the, coalition, forces, in, 1813, 1814, they, provided, a, useful, addition, to, the, coalition, while, depriving, napoleon, of, much, needed, manpower, the, initial, stages, of, the, industrial, revolution, had, much, to, do, with, larger, military, forces, it, became, easy, to, mass, produce, weapons, and, thus, to, equip, larger, forces, britain, was, the, largest, single, manufacturer, of, armaments, in, this, period, it, supplied, most, of, the, weapons, used, by, the, coalition, powers, throughout, the, conflicts, france, produced, the, second, largest, total, of, armaments, equipping, its, own, huge, forces, as, well, as, those, of, the, confederation, of, the, rhine, and, other, allies, napoleon, showed, innovative, tendencies, in, his, use, of, mobility, to, offset, numerical, disadvantages, as, demonstrated, in, the, rout, of, the, austro, russian, forces, in, 1805, in, the, battle, of, austerlitz, the, french, army, redefined, the, role, of, artillery, forming, independent, mobile, units, as, opposed, to, the, previous, tradition, of, attaching, artillery, pieces, in, support, of, troops, the, semaphore, system, had, allowed, the, french, war, minister, carnot, to, communicate, with, french, forces, on, the, frontiers, throughout, the, 1790s, the, french, continued, to, use, this, system, throughout, the, napoleonic, wars, aerial, surveillance, was, used, for, the, first, time, when, the, french, used, a, hot, air, balloon, to, survey, coalition, positions, before, the, battle, of, fleurus, on, 26, june, 1794, historians, have, explored, how, the, napoleonic, wars, became, total, wars, most, historians, argue, that, the, escalation, in, size, and, scope, came, from, two, sources, first, was, the, ideological, clash, between, revolutionary, egalitarian, and, conservative, hierarchical, belief, systems, second, was, the, emergence, of, nationalism, in, france, germany, spain, and, elsewhere, that, made, these, people, s, wars, instead, of, contests, between, monarchs, bell, has, argued, that, even, more, important, than, ideology, and, nationalism, were, the, intellectual, transformations, in, the, culture, of, war, that, came, about, through, the, age, of, enlightenment, one, factor, he, says, is, that, war, was, no, longer, a, routine, event, but, a, transforming, experience, for, societies, a, total, experience, secondly, the, military, emerged, in, its, own, right, as, a, separate, sphere, of, society, distinct, from, the, ordinary, civilian, world, the, french, revolution, made, every, civilian, a, part, of, the, war, machine, either, as, a, soldier, through, universal, conscription, or, as, a, vital, cog, in, the, home, front, machinery, supporting, and, supplying, the, army, out, of, that, says, bell, came, militarism, the, belief, that, the, military, role, was, morally, superior, to, the, civilian, role, in, times, of, great, national, crisis, the, fighting, army, represented, the, essence, of, the, nation, s, soul, as, napoleon, proclaimed, it, is, the, soldier, who, founds, a, republic, and, it, is, the, soldier, who, maintains, it, napoleon, said, on, his, career, i, closed, the, gulf, of, anarchy, and, brought, order, out, of, chaos, i, rewarded, merit, regardless, of, birth, or, wealth, wherever, i, found, it, i, abolished, feudalism, and, restored, equality, to, all, religion, and, before, the, law, i, fought, the, decrepit, monarchies, of, the, old, regime, because, the, alternative, was, the, destruction, of, all, this, i, purified, the, revolution, intelligence, played, a, pivotal, factor, throughout, the, napoleonic, wars, and, could, very, well, have, changed, the, tide, of, war, the, use, and, misuse, of, military, intelligence, dictated, the, course, of, many, major, battles, during, the, napoleonic, wars, some, of, the, major, battles, that, were, dictated, by, the, use, of, intelligence, include, the, battle, of, waterloo, battle, of, leipzig, battle, of, salamanca, and, the, battle, of, vitoria, a, major, exception, to, the, greater, use, of, superior, military, intelligence, to, claim, victory, was, the, battle, of, jena, in, 1806, at, the, battle, of, jena, even, prussian, superior, military, intelligence, was, not, enough, to, counter, the, sheer, military, force, of, napoleons, armies, the, use, of, intelligence, varied, greatly, across, the, major, world, powers, of, the, war, napoleon, at, this, time, had, more, supply, of, intelligence, given, to, him, than, any, french, general, before, him, however, napoleon, was, not, an, advocate, of, military, intelligence, at, this, time, as, he, often, found, it, unreliable, and, inaccurate, when, compared, to, his, own, preconceived, notions, of, the, enemy, napoleon, rather, studied, his, enemy, via, domestic, newspapers, diplomatic, publications, maps, and, prior, documents, of, military, engagements, in, the, theaters, of, war, in, which, he, would, operate, it, was, this, stout, and, constant, study, of, the, enemy, which, made, napoleon, the, military, mastermind, of, his, time, whereas, his, opponents, britain, austria, prussia, and, russia, were, much, more, reliant, on, traditional, intelligence, gathering, methods, and, were, much, more, quickly, and, willing, to, act, on, them, the, methods, of, intelligence, during, these, wars, were, to, include, the, formation, of, vast, and, complex, networks, of, corresponding, agents, codebreaking, and, cryptanalysis, the, greatest, cipher, to, be, used, to, hide, military, operations, during, this, time, was, known, as, the, great, paris, cipher, used, by, the, french, however, thanks, to, the, hard, work, of, british, codebreakers, like, george, scovell, the, british, were, able, to, crack, french, ciphers, and, gain, vast, amounts, of, military, intelligence, on, napoleon, and, his, armies, french, diplomat, talleyrand, served, as, a, source, of, intelligence, for, the, coalition, powers, against, napoleon, at, the, congress, of, erfurt, in, september, october, 1808, talleyrand, secretly, counseled, tsar, alexander, alexander, s, attitude, towards, napoleon, was, one, of, apprehensive, opposition, talleyrand, believed, napoleon, would, eventually, destroy, the, empire, he, had, worked, to, build, across, multiple, rulers, after, his, resignation, in, 1807, from, the, ministry, talleyrand, began, to, accept, bribes, from, hostile, powers, mainly, austria, but, also, russia, to, betray, napoleon, s, secrets, various, agents, of, napoleon, were, known, such, as, madame, d, oettlinger, the, napoleonic, wars, were, a, defining, event, of, the, early, 19th, century, and, inspired, many, works, of, fiction, from, then, until, the, present, day
