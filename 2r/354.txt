expanded, to, what, is, now, modern, day, mozambique, botswana, malawi, and, zambia, the, portuguese, term, monomotapa, is, a, transliteration, of, the, shona, royal, title, mwenemutapa, or, munhumutapa, derived, from, a, combination, of, two, words, mwene, or, munhu, meaning, man, and, mutapa, meaning, conquerer, over, time, the, monarch, s, royal, title, was, applied, to, the, kingdom, as, a, whole, and, used, to, denote, the, kingdom, s, territory, on, maps, from, the, period, there, are, several, mutapa, origin, stories, the, most, widely, accepted, told, by, oral, tradition, is, of, the, princes, of, great, zimbabwe, the, first, mutapa, was, a, warrior, prince, named, nyatsimba, mutota, from, the, kingdom, of, zimbabwe, who, expanded, the, reach, of, the, kingdom, initially, to, discover, new, sources, of, salt, in, the, north, it, is, believed, prince, mutota, found, salt, in, his, conquest, of, the, tavara, a, shona, subdivision, another, historical, narrative, of, the, empire, s, origins, is, that, prince, mutota, had, broken, away, from, great, zimbabwe, after, going, to, war, with, prince, mukwati, believed, to, have, been, either, his, brother, or, cousin, over, control, of, the, kingdom, mutota, s, son, and, successor, nyanhewe, matope, extended, this, new, kingdom, into, an, empire, encompassing, most, of, the, lands, between, tavara, and, the, indian, ocean, this, empire, had, achieved, uniting, a, number, of, different, peoples, in, southern, africa, by, building, strong, well, trained, armies, and, encouraging, states, to, join, voluntarily, offering, membership, in, the, great, council, of, the, empire, to, any, who, joined, without, resistance, matope, s, armies, overran, the, kingdom, of, the, manyika, as, well, as, the, coastal, kingdoms, of, kiteve, and, madanda, by, the, time, the, portuguese, arrived, on, the, coast, of, mozambique, the, mutapa, kingdom, was, the, premier, state, in, the, region, he, raised, a, strong, army, which, conquered, the, dande, area, of, the, tonga, and, tavara, the, empire, had, reached, its, full, extent, by, the, year, 1480, a, mere, 50, years, following, its, creation, the, portuguese, dominated, much, of, southeast, africa, s, coast, laying, waste, to, sofala, and, kilwa, by, 1515, their, main, goal, was, to, dominate, the, trade, with, india, however, they, unwittingly, became, mere, carriers, for, luxury, goods, between, mutapa, s, sub, kingdoms, and, india, main, commodity, brokers, included, zharare, and, mhere, mhere, as, the, portuguese, settled, along, the, coast, they, made, their, way, into, the, hinterland, as, sertanejos, backwoodsmen, these, sertanejos, lived, alongside, swahili, traders, and, even, took, up, service, among, shona, kings, as, interpreters, and, political, advisors, one, such, sertanejo, ant, nio, fernandes, managed, to, travel, through, almost, all, the, shona, kingdoms, including, mutapa, s, metropolitan, district, between, 1512, and, 1516, he, mainly, travelled, with, dhafa, zharare, son, of, chipere, zharare, who, wanted, the, son, to, learn, how, to, trade, the, portuguese, finally, entered, into, direct, relations, with, the, mwenemutapa, in, the, 1560s, they, recorded, a, wealth, of, information, about, the, mutapa, kingdom, as, well, as, its, predecessor, great, zimbabwe, according, to, swahili, traders, whose, accounts, were, recorded, by, the, portuguese, historian, jo, o, de, barros, great, zimbabwe, was, a, medieval, capital, city, built, of, stones, of, marvellous, size, without, the, use, of, mortar, and, while, the, site, was, not, within, mutapa, s, borders, the, mwenemutapa, kept, noblemen, and, some, of, his, wives, there, by, the, 17th, century, other, europeans, would, extensively, describe, mutapa, architecture, through, paintings, olfert, dapper, revealed, four, grand, gateways, which, led, to, several, halls, and, chambers, in, the, mutapa, palace, the, ceilings, of, the, rooms, in, the, palace, were, gilt, with, golden, plates, alongside, ivory, chandeliers, which, hung, on, silver, chains, and, filled, the, halls, with, light, in, 1569, king, sebastian, of, portugal, made, a, grant, of, arms, to, the, mwenemutapa, these, were, blazoned, gules, between, two, arrows, argent, an, african, hoe, barwise, bladed, or, handled, argent, the, shield, surmounted, by, a, crown, oriental, this, was, probably, the, first, grant, of, arms, to, a, native, of, southern, africa, however, it, is, unlikely, that, these, arms, were, ever, actually, used, by, the, mwenemutapa, in, 1561, a, portuguese, jesuit, missionary, gon, alo, da, silveira, managed, to, make, his, way, into, the, mwenemutapa, s, court, and, convert, him, to, christianity, this, did, not, go, well, with, the, muslim, merchants, in, the, capital, and, they, persuaded, the, king, to, kill, the, jesuit, only, a, few, days, after, his, baptism, this, was, all, the, justification, the, portuguese, needed, to, penetrate, the, interior, and, take, control, of, the, gold, mines, and, ivory, routes, after, a, lengthy, preparation, an, expedition, of, 1, 000, men, under, francisco, barreto, was, launched, in, 1568, they, managed, to, get, as, far, as, the, upper, zambezi, but, local, disease, decimated, the, force, the, portuguese, returned, to, their, base, in, 1572, and, took, their, frustrations, out, on, the, swahili, traders, whom, they, massacred, they, replaced, them, with, portuguese, and, their, half, african, progeny, who, became, prazeiros, estate, holders, of, the, lower, zambezi, mutapa, maintained, a, position, of, strength, exacting, a, subsidy, from, each, captain, of, portuguese, mozambique, that, took, the, office, the, mwenemutapa, also, levied, a, duty, of, 50, percent, on, all, trade, goods, imported, mutapa, proved, invulnerable, to, attack, and, even, economic, manipulation, due, to, the, mwenemutapa, s, strong, control, over, gold, production, what, posed, the, greatest, threat, was, infighting, among, different, factions, which, led, to, opposing, sides, calling, on, the, portuguese, for, military, aid, however, the, portuguese, proved, to, be, happy, with, the, downfall, of, the, mutapa, state, in, 1629, the, mwenemutapa, attempted, to, throw, out, the, portuguese, he, failed, and, in, turn, he, himself, was, overthrown, leading, to, the, portuguese, installation, of, mavura, mhande, felipe, on, the, throne, mutapa, signed, treaties, making, it, a, portuguese, vassal, and, ceding, gold, mines, but, none, of, these, concessions, were, ever, put, into, effect, mutapa, remained, nominally, independent, though, practically, a, client, state, all, the, while, portugal, increased, control, over, much, of, southeast, africa, with, the, beginnings, of, a, colonial, system, the, portuguese, were, now, in, control, of, the, trade, and, the, trade, routes, another, problem, for, mutapa, was, that, its, tributaries, such, as, kiteve, madanda, and, manyika, ceased, paying, tribute, at, the, same, time, a, new, kingdom, under, the, rozvi, dynasty, near, barwe, was, on, the, rise, all, of, this, was, hastened, by, portugal, retaining, a, presence, on, the, coast, and, in, the, capital, at, least, one, part, of, the, 1629, treaty, that, was, acted, on, was, the, provision, allowing, portuguese, settlement, within, mutapa, it, also, allowed, the, praezeros, to, establish, fortified, settlements, across, the, kingdom, in, 1663, the, praezeros, were, able, to, depose, mwenemutapa, siti, kazurukamusapa, and, put, their, own, nominee, kamharapasu, mukombwe, on, the, throne, in, the, 17th, century, a, low, ranking, mutapa, prince, broke, away, from, the, empire, invading, the, neighboring, kingdom, of, butua, the, leader, of, this, dynasty, became, known, as, changamire, dombo, a, possible, reason, for, the, breakaway, was, dombo, s, dissatisfaction, with, the, levels, of, portuguese, interference, in, the, mwenemutapa, empire, s, governance, by, the, late, 17th, century, changamire, domborakonachingwango, or, dombo, for, short, pronounced, as, mb, was, actively, challenging, mutapa, in, 1684, his, forces, encountered, and, decisively, defeated, those, of, mwenemutapa, kamharapasu, mukombwe, just, south, of, mutapa, s, metro, district, at, the, battle, of, mahungwe, when, mukombwe, died, in, 1692, a, succession, crisis, erupted, the, portuguese, backed, one, successor, and, dombo, another, in, support, of, his, candidate, changamire, dombo, razed, the, portuguese, fair, town, of, dembarare, next, to, the, mutapa, capital, and, slaughtered, the, portuguese, traders, and, their, entire, following, from, 1692, until, 1694, mwenemutapa, nyakambira, ruled, mutapa, independently, nyakambira, was, later, killed, in, battle, with, the, portuguese, who, then, placed, nyamaende, mhande, on, the, throne, as, their, puppet, in, 1695, changamire, dombo, overran, the, gold, producing, kingdom, of, manyika, and, took, his, army, east, and, destroyed, the, portuguese, fair, town, of, masikwesi, this, gave, him, complete, control, of, all, gold, producing, territory, from, butwa, to, manyika, supplanting, mutapa, as, the, premier, shona, kingdom, in, the, region, it, appears, neither, the, rozwi, nor, the, portuguese, could, maintain, control, of, the, mutapa, state, for, very, long, and, it, moved, back, and, forth, between, the, two, throughout, the, 17th, century, far, from, a, victim, of, conquest, the, mutapa, rulers, actually, invited, in, foreign, powers, to, bolster, their, rule, this, included, vassalage, to, portuguese, east, africa, from, 1629, to, 1663, and, vassalage, to, the, rozwi, empire, from, 1663, until, the, portuguese, return, in, 1694, portuguese, control, of, mutapa, was, maintained, or, at, least, represented, by, an, armed, garrison, at, the, capital, in, 1712, yet, another, coveter, of, the, throne, invited, the, rozwi, back, to, put, him, on, the, throne, and, kick, out, the, portuguese, this, they, did, and, mutapa, again, came, under, the, control, of, the, rozwi, empire, the, new, mwenemutapa, samatambira, nyamhandu, i, become, their, vassal, while, the, outgoing, king, was, forced, to, retreat, to, chidama, in, what, is, now, mozambique, the, rozwi, quickly, lost, interest, in, mutapa, as, they, sought, to, consolidate, their, position, in, the, south, mutapa, regained, its, independence, around, 1720, by, this, time, the, kingdom, of, mutapa, had, lost, nearly, all, of, the, zimbabwe, plateau, to, the, rozwi, empire, in, 1723, nyamhandi, moved, his, capital, into, the, valley, near, the, portuguese, trading, settlement, of, tete, under, mwenemutapa, nyatsusu, upon, his, death, in, 1740, the, young, dehwe, mapunzagutu, took, power, he, sought, portuguese, support, and, invited, them, back, to, mutapa, along, with, their, garrison, of, armed, men, but, mutapa, remained, independent, the, mwenemutapa, died, in, 1759, sparking, yet, another, civil, war, for, the, throne, this, one, was, more, destructive, than, its, predecessors, and, mutapa, never, recovered, the, winners, ended, up, governing, an, even, more, reduced, land, from, chidima, they, used, the, title, mambo, a, chidima, and, ruled, independently, of, portugal, until, 1917, when, mambo, chioko, the, last, king, of, the, dynasty, was, killed, in, battle, against, the, portuguese, the, empire, had, another, indirect, side, effect, on, the, history, of, southern, africa, gold, from, the, empire, inspired, in, europeans, a, belief, that, mwenemutapa, held, the, legendary, mines, of, king, solomon, referred, to, in, the, bible, as, the, biblical, port, of, ophir, the, belief, that, the, mines, were, inside, the, mwenemutapa, kingdom, in, southern, africa, was, one, of, the, factors, that, led, to, the, portuguese, exploration, of, the, hinterland, of, sofala, in, the, 16th, century, and, this, contributed, to, early, development, of, mozambique, as, the, legend, was, widely, used, among, the, less, educated, populace, to, recruit, colonists, some, documents, suggest, that, most, of, the, early, colonists, dreamt, of, finding, the, legendary, city, of, gold, in, southern, africa, a, belief, mirroring, the, early, south, american, colonial, search, for, el, dorado, and, quite, possibly, inspired, by, it, early, trade, in, gold, came, to, an, end, as, the, mines, ran, out, and, the, deterioration, of, the, mutapa, state, eliminated, the, financial, and, political, support, for, further, developing, sources, of, gold, legacy, for, several, centuries, this, trading, empire, enabled, people, across, a, large, territory, to, live, in, peace, and, security, under, a, stable, government, and, succession, of, rulers, with, primary, records, dating, back, to, 1502, the, empire, is, a, prime, testing, ground, for, theories, concerning, economic, political, and, religious, development, in, pre, colonial, africa, beach, comments, that, the, mutapa, was, one, of, only, four, shona, states, that, was, not, entirely, uprooted, by, new, settlements, of, people, and, the, only, one, close, to, portuguese, centers, thus, providing, important, data, on, contact, and, relationships, between, this, and, other, shona, states, as, well, as, with, europeans, the, mutapa, empire, is, an, example, of, a, working, system, of, government, in, africa, and, of, a, flourishing, civilization, both, of, which, are, often, assumed, to, have, been, absent, before, the, coming, of, the, europeans, the, emperor, mutope, had, left, the, empire, with, a, well, organised, religion, with, a, powerful, shamanism, the, religion, of, the, mutapa, kingdom, revolved, around, ritual, consultation, of, spirits, and, of, ancestors, shrines, were, maintained, within, the, capital, by, spirit, mediums, known, as, mhondoro, the, mhondoro, also, served, as, oral, historians, recording, the, names, and, deeds, of, past, kings
