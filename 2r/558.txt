by, the, germans, lenin, viewed, the, newly, independent, poland, as, a, critical, route, for, spreading, communist, revolutions, into, europe, meanwhile, polish, leaders, including, j, zef, pi, sudski, aimed, to, restore, poland, s, pre, 1772, borders, and, secure, the, country, s, position, in, the, region, throughout, 1919, polish, forces, occupied, much, of, present, day, lithuania, and, belarus, emerging, victorious, in, the, polish, ukrainian, war, however, soviet, forces, regained, strength, after, their, victories, in, the, russian, civil, war, and, symon, petliura, leader, of,

starting, in, june, 1920, by, august, soviet, troops, had, pushed, polish, forces, back, to, warsaw, however, at, the, decisive, battle, of, warsaw, 1920, polish, forces, achieved, an, unexpected, victory, between, 12, and, 25, august, 1920, turning, the, tide, of, the, war, this, battle, often, referred, to, as, the, miracle, on, the, vistula, is, considered, one, of, the, most, significant, military, triumphs, in, polish, history, the, war, ended, with, a, ceasefire, on, 18, october, 1920, and, peace, negotiations, led, to, the, peace, of, riga, signed, on, 18, march, 1921, the, treaty,

polish, sources, it, is, also, referred, to, as, the, war, of, 1920, polish, wojna, 1920, roku, the, ending, year, of, the, conflict, is, variously, given, as, either, 1920, or, 1921, this, confusion, stems, from, the, fact, that, while, the, ceasefire, came, into, force, on, 18, october, 1920, the, official, treaty, ending, the, war, was, signed, on, 18, march, 1921, while, the, events, of, late,

republic, by, july, 1919, but, had, already, become, embroiled, in, new, conflicts, with, germany, the, 1919, 1921, silesian, uprisings, and, the, january, 1919, border, conflict, with, czechoslovakia, meanwhile, soviet, russia, focused, on, thwarting, the, counterrevolution, and, the, 1918, 1925, intervention, by, the, allied, powers, the, first, clashes, between, polish, and, soviet, forces, occurred, in, autumn, and, winter, 1918, 1919, but, it, took, a, year, and, a, half, for, a, full, scale, war, to, develop, the, western, powers, considered, any, significant, territorial, expansion, of, poland, at, the, expense, of, russia, or, germany, to, be, highly, disruptive, to, the, post, world, war, i, order, among, other, factors, the, western, allies, did, not, want, to, give, germany, and, russia, a, reason, to, conspire, together, the, rise, of, the, unrecognized, bolshevik, regime, complicated, this, rationale, the, treaty, of, versailles, signed, on, 28, june, 1919, regulated, poland, s, western, border, the, paris, peace, conference, 1919, 1920, had, not, made, a, definitive, ruling, in, regard, to, poland, s, eastern, border, but, on, 8, december, 1919, the, allied, supreme, war, council, issued, a, provisional, boundary, its, later, version, would, be, known, as, the, curzon, line, it, was, an, attempt, to, define, the, areas, that, had, an, indisputably, polish, ethnic, majority, the, permanent, border, was, contingent, on, the, western, powers, future, negotiations, with, white, russia, presumed, to, prevail, in, the, russian, civil, war, pi, sudski, and, his, allies, blamed, prime, minister, ignacy, paderewski, for, this, outcome, and, caused, his, dismissal, paderewski, embittered, withdrew, from, politics, the, leader, of, russia, s, new, bolshevik, government, vladimir, lenin, aimed, to, regain, control, of, the, territories, abandoned, by, russia, in, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, in, march, 1918, the, treaty, was, annulled, by, russia, on, 13, november, 1918, and, to, set, up, soviet, governments, in, the, emerging, countries, in, the, western, parts, of, the, former, russian, empire, the, more, ambitious, goal, was, to, also, reach, germany, where, he, expected, a, socialist, revolution, to, break, out, by, the, end, of, summer, 1919, the, soviets, had, taken, over, most, of, eastern, and, central, ukraine, formerly, parts, of, the, russian, empire, and, driven, the, directorate, of, ukraine, from, kiev, in, february, 1919, they, set, up, the, socialist, soviet, republic, of, lithuania, and, belorussia, litbel, it, is, however, unlikely, that, the, soviet, forced, plannes, further, incursions, westward, from, late, 1919, lenin, encouraged, by, the, red, army, s, civil, war, victories, over, the, white, russian, forces, and, their, western, allies, began, to, envision, the, future, of, world, revolution, with, greater, optimism, the, bolsheviks, proclaimed, the, need, for, the, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, and, agitated, for, a, worldwide, communist, community, they, intended, to, link, the, revolution, in, russia, with, a, communist, revolutions, and, interventions, in, hungary, 1918, 1920, they, had, hoped, for, and, to, assist, other, communist, movements, in, europe, to, be, able, to, provide, direct, physical, support, to, revolutionaries, in, the, west, the, red, army, would, have, to, cross, the, territory, of, romania, according, to, the, historian, andrzej, chwalba, however, the, scenario, was, different, in, late, 1919, and, winter, spring, 1920, the, soviets, facing, decreasing, revolutionary, fervor, in, europe, and, having, to, deal, with, russia, s, own, problems, attempted, to, make, peace, with, its, neighbors, including, poland, according, to, aviel, roshwald, pi, sudski, hoped, to, incorporate, most, of, the, territories, of, the, defunct, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, into, the, future, polish, state, by, structuring, it, as, the, polish, led, multinational, federation, pi, sudski, had, wanted, to, break, up, the, russian, empire, and, set, up, the, intermarium, federation, of, various, different, states, poland, lithuania, belarus, ukraine, and, other, central, and, east, european, countries, that, emerged, from, the, crumbling, empires, after, world, war, i, in, pi, sudski, s, vision, poland, would, replace, a, truncated, and, vastly, reduced, russia, as, the, great, power, of, eastern, europe, his, plan, excluded, negotiations, prior, to, military, victory, he, had, hoped, that, the, new, poland, led, union, would, become, a, counterweight, to, any, potential, imperialist, intentions, of, russia, or, germany, pi, sudski, believed, that, there, could, be, no, independent, poland, without, a, ukraine, free, of, russian, control, thus, his, main, interest, was, in, splitting, ukraine, from, russia, he, used, military, force, to, expand, the, polish, borders, in, galicia, and, volhynia, and, crush, a, ukrainian, attempt, at, self, determination, in, the, disputed, territories, east, of, the, curzon, line, which, contained, a, significant, polish, minority, on, 7, february, 1919, pi, sudski, spoke, on, the, subject, of, poland, s, future, frontiers, at, the, moment, poland, is, essentially, without, borders, and, all, that, we, can, gain, in, this, regard, in, the, west, depends, on, the, entente, on, the, extent, to, which, it, may, wish, to, squeeze, germany, in, the, east, it, s, a, different, matter, there, are, doors, here, that, open, and, close, and, it, depends, on, who, forces, them, open, and, how, far, polish, military, forces, had, thus, set, out, to, expand, far, in, the, eastern, direction, as, pi, sudski, imagined, closed, within, the, boundaries, of, the, 16th, century, cut, off, from, the, black, sea, and, baltic, sea, deprived, of, land, and, mineral, wealth, of, the, south, and, south, east, russia, could, easily, move, into, the, status, of, second, grade, power, poland, as, the, largest, and, strongest, of, the, new, states, could, easily, establish, a, sphere, of, influence, stretching, from, finland, to, the, caucasus, pi, sudski, s, concepts, appeared, more, progressive, and, democratic, in, comparison, with, the, rival, national, democracy, s, plans, although, both, pursued, the, idea, of, direct, incorporation, and, polonization, of, the, disputed, eastern, lands, however, pi, sudski, used, his, federation, idea, instrumentally, as, he, wrote, to, his, close, associate, leon, wasilewski, in, april, 1919, for, now, i, want, to, be, neither, an, imperialist, nor, a, federalist, taking, into, account, that, in, this, god, s, world, an, empty, talk, of, the, brotherhood, of, people, and, nations, as, well, as, the, american, little, doctrines, seem, to, be, winning, i, gladly, side, with, the, federalists, according, to, chwalba, the, differences, between, pi, sudski, s, vision, of, poland, and, that, of, his, rival, national, democratic, leader, roman, dmowski, were, more, rhetorical, than, real, pi, sudski, had, made, many, obfuscating, statements, but, never, specifically, stated, his, views, regarding, poland, s, eastern, borders, or, political, arrangements, he, intended, for, the, region, from, late, 1917, polish, revolutionary, military, units, were, formed, in, russia, they, were, combined, into, the, western, rifle, division, in, october, 1918, in, summer, 1918, a, short, lived, polish, communist, government, led, by, stefan, heltman, was, created, in, moscow, both, the, military, and, civilian, structures, were, meant, to, facilitate, the, eventual, introduction, of, communism, into, poland, in, the, form, of, a, polish, soviet, republic, given, the, precarious, situation, resulting, from, the, withdrawal, of, german, forces, from, belarus, and, lithuania, and, the, expected, arrival, of, the, red, army, there, polish, self, defence, had, been, organized, in,

the, city, after, two, days, of, fighting, the, polish, action, drove, the, litbel, government, from, its, proclaimed, capital, upon, the, taking, of, vilnius, in, pursuit, of, his, federation, objectives, pi, sudski, issued, a, proclamation, to, the, inhabitants, of, the, former, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, on, 22, april, it, was, sharply, criticized, by, his, rival, national, democrats, who, demanded, direct, incorporation, of, the, former, grand, duchy, lands, by, poland, and, signaled, their, opposition, to, pi, sudski, s, territorial, and, political, concepts, pi, sudski, had, thus, proceeded, to, restore, the, historic, territories, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, by, military, means, leaving, the, necessary, political, determinations, for, later, on, 25, april, lenin, ordered, the, western, front, commander, to, reclaim, vilnius, as, soon, as, possible, the, red, army, formations, that, attacked, the, polish, forces, were, defeated, by, edward, rydz, mig, y,

white, forces, elsewhere, withdrew, from, its, positions, the, polish, lithuanian, belarusian, front, was, established, on, 15, may, and, placed, under, command, of, general, stanis, aw, szeptycki, in, a, statute, passed, on, 15, may, polish, sejm, called, for, the, inclusion, of, the, eastern, borderline, nations, in, the, polish, state, as, autonomous, entities, it, was, intended, to, make, a, positive, impression, on, the, participants, at, the, paris, peace, conference, at, the, conference, prime, minister, and, foreign, minister, ignacy, paderewski, declared, poland, s, support, for, self, determination, of, the, eastern, nations, in, line, with, woodrow, wilson, s, doctrine, and, in, an, effort, to, secure, western, support, for, poland, s, policies, in, regard, to, ukraine, belarus, and, lithuania, the, polish, offensive, was, discontinued, around, the, line, of, german, trenches, and, fortifications, from, world, war, i, because, of, high, likelihood, of, poland, s, war, with, weimar, germany, over, territorial, and, other, issues, half, of, poland, s, military, strength, had, been, concentrated, on, the, german, front, by, mid, june, the, offensive, in, the, east, was, resumed, at, the, end, of, june, following, the, treaty, of, versailles, the, treaty, signed, and, ratified, by, germany, preserved, the, status, quo, in, western, poland, on, the, southern, front, in, volhynia, in, may, and, in, july, the, polish, forces, confronted, the, red, army, which, was, in, process, of, pushing, petliura, s, ukrainian, units, out, of, the, contested, territories, the, rural, orthodox, population, there, was, hostile, to, the, polish, authorities, and, actively, supported, the, bolsheviks, also, in, podolia, and, near, the, eastern, reaches, of, galicia, the, polish, armies, kept, slowly, advancing, to, the, east, until, december, they, crossed, the, zbruch, river, and, displaced, soviet, forces, from, a, number, of, localities, the, polish, forces, took, minsk, on, 8, august, the, berezina, river, was, reached, on, 18, august, on, 28, august, tanks, were, deployed, for, the, first, time, and, the, town, of, babruysk, was, captured, by, 2, september, polish, units, reached, the, daugava, river, barysaw, was, taken, on, 10, september, and, parts, of, polotsk, on, 21, september, by, mid, september, the, poles, secured, the, region, along, the, daugava, from, the, dysna, river, to, daugavpils, the, frontline, had, also, extended, south, cutting, through, polesia, and, volhynia, along, the, zbruch, river, it, reached, the, romanian, border, a, red, army, assault, between, the, daugava, and, berezina, rivers, was, repelled, in, october, and, the, front, had, become, relatively, inactive, with, sporadic, encounters, only, as, the, line, designated, by, pi, sudski, to, be, the, goal, of, the, polish, operation, in, the, north, was, reached, in, autumn, 1919, the, sejm, voted, to, incorporate, into, poland, the, conquered, territories, up, to, the, daugava, and, berezina, rivers, including, minsk, the, polish, successes, in, summer, 1919, resulted, from, the, fact, that, the, soviets, prioritized, the, war, with, the, white, forces, which, was, more, crucial, for, them, the, successes, created, an, illusion, of, polish, military, prowess, and, soviet, weakness, as, pi, sudski, put, it, i, am, not, worried, about, the, strength, of, russia, if, i, wanted, to, i, could, go, now, say, to, moscow, and, no, one, would, be, able, to, resist, my, power, the, offensive, was, restrained, in, late, summer, by, pi, sudski, because, he, did, not, want, to, improve, the, strategic, situation, of, the, advancing, whites, in, early, summer, 1919, the, white, movement, had, gained, the, initiative, and, its, forces, commanded, by, anton, denikin, and, known, as, the, volunteer, army, marched, on, moscow, pi, suski, refused, to, join, the, allied, intervention, in, the, russian, civil, war, because, he, considered, the, whites, more, threatening, to, poland, than, the, bolsheviks, pi, sudski, s, adversarial, relationship, with, tsarist, russia, went, back, to, the, earlier, stages, of, his, career, he, engaged, in, warfare, with, soviet, russia, from, the, beginning, of, his, tenure, as, polish, commander, in, chief, based, on, this, experience, he, underestimated, the, strength, of, the, bolsheviks, pi, sudski, also, thought, he, could, get, a, better, deal, for, poland, from, the, bolsheviks, than, from, the, whites, who, represented, in, his, opinion, the, old, russian, imperial, policies, hostile, to, strong, poland, and, ukraine, independent, from, russia, pi, sudski, s, main, objectives, the, bolsheviks, had, proclaimed, the, partitions, of, poland, to, be, invalid, and, declared, their, support, for, self, determination, of, the, polish, nation, pi, sudski, thus, speculated, that, poland, would, be, better, off, with, the, internationalist, bolsheviks, who, were, also, alienated, from, the, western, powers, than, with, the, restored, russian, empire, its, traditional, nationalism, and, its, partnership, with, western, politics, by, his, refusal, to, join, the, attack, on, lenin, s, struggling, government, he, ignored, strong, pressure, from, the, triple, entente, leaders, and, possibly, saved, the, bolshevik, government, in, summer, to, fall, 1919, although, a, full, scale, attack, by, the, poles, to, support, denikin, would, not, have, been, possible, mikhail, tukhachevsky, later, commented, on, the, likely, disastrous, consequences, for, the, bolsheviks, if, the, polish, government, undertook, military, cooperation, with, denikin, at, the, time, of, his, advance, on, moscow, in, a, book, he, later, published, denikin, pointed, at, poland, as, the, savior, of, the, bolshevik, power, denikin, twice, appealed, to, pi, sudski, for, help, in, summer, and, in, autumn, 1919, according, to, denikin, the, defeat, of, the, south, of, russia, will, make, poland, face, the, power, that, will, become, a, calamity, for, the, polish, culture, and, will, threaten, the, existence, of, the, polish, state, according, to, pi, sudski, the, lesser, evil, is, to, facilitate, a, white, russia, s, defeat, by, red, russia, with, any, russia, we, fight, for, poland, let, all, that, filthy, west, talk, all, they, want, we, re, not, going, to, be, dragged, into, and, used, for, the, fight, against, the, russian, revolution, quite, to, the, contrary, in, the, name, of, permanent, polish, interests, we, want, to, make, it, easier, for, the, revolutionary, army, to, act, against, the, counter, revolutionary, army, on, 12, december, the, red, army, pushed, denikin, out, of, kiev, the, self, perceived, interests, of, poland, and, white, russia, were, irreconcilable, pi, sudski, wanted, to, break, up, russia, and, create, a, powerful, poland, denikin, alexander, kolchak, and, nikolai, yudenich, wanted, territorial, integrity, for, the, one, great, and, indivisible, russia, pi, sudski, held, the, bolshevik, military, forces, in, low, regard, and, thought, of, red, russia, as, easy, to, defeat, the, victorious, in, the, civil, war, communists, were, going, to, be, pushed, far, to, the, east, and, deprived, of, ukraine, belarus, the, baltic, lands, and, the, southern, caucasus, they, would, no, longer, constitute, a, threat, to, poland, from, the, beginning, of, the, conflict, many, peace, initiatives, had, been, declared, by, the, polish, and, russian, sides, but, they, were, intended, as, cover, or, stalling, for, time, as, each, side, concentrated, on, military, preparations, and, moves, one, series, of, polish, soviet, negotiations, commenced, in, bia, owie, a, after, the, termination, of, the, summer, 1919, military, activities, they, were, moved, in, early, november, 1919, to, mikashevichy, pi, sudski, s, associate, ignacy, boerner, met, there, with, lenin, s, emissary, julian, marchlewski, buoyed, by, their, armies, successes, in, the, russian, civil, war, the, soviet, government, rejected, the, tough, polish, armistice, conditions, in, december, pi, sudski, broke, off, the, mikashevichy, talks, two, days, after, the, soviet, takeover, of, kiev, but, major, military, operations, had, not, been, resumed, early, in, the, talks, boerner, informed, marchlewski, that, poland, had, no, intention, of, renewing, its, offensive, it, allowed, the, soviets, to, move, forty, three, thousand, troops, from, the, polish, front, to, fight, denikin, the, only, exception, to, the, polish, policy, of, front, stabilization, since, autumn, 1919, was, the, winter, attack, on, daugavpils, rydz, mig, y, s, previous, attempts, to, capture, the, city, in, summer, and, early, autumn, had, been, unsuccessful, a, secret, political, and, military, pact, regarding, a, common, attack, on, daugavpils, was, signed, between, representatives, of, poland, and, the, latvian, provisional, government, on, 30, december, on, 3, january, 1920, polish, and, latvian, forces, 30, 000, poles, and, 10, 000, latvians, commenced, a, joint, operation, against, the, surprised, enemy, the, bolshevik, 15th, army, withdrew, and, had, not, been, pursued, the, fighting, terminated, on, 25, january, the, taking, of, daugavpils, was, accomplished, primarily, by, the, 3rd, legions, infantry, division, under, rydz, mig, y, afterwards, the, town, and, its, vicinity, were, handed, over, to, the, latvians, the, outcome, of, the, campaign, disrupted, communications, between, lithuanian, and, russian, forces, a, polish, garrison, was, stationed, in, daugavpils, until, july, 1920, simultaneously, the, latvian, authorities, pursued, peace, negotiations, with, the, soviets, which, resulted, in, the, signing, of, a, preliminary, armistice, pi, sudski, and, the, polish, diplomacy, were, not, notified, and, had, not, been, aware, of, this, development, the, fighting, in, 1919, resulted, in, the, formation, of, a, very, long, frontline, which, according, to, the, historian, eugeniusz, duraczy, ski, favored, poland, at, this, stage, in, late, 1919, and, early, 1920, pi, sudski, undertook, his, gargantuan, task, of, breaking, up, russia, and, creating, the, intermarium, bloc, of, countries, given, the, refusal, of, lithuania, and, other, eastern, baltic, region, countries, to, participate, in, the, project, he, set, his, sights, on, ukraine, in, late, autumn, 1919, to, many, polish, politicians, it, appeared, that, poland, had, achieved, strategically, desirable, borders, in, the, east, and, therefore, fighting, the, bolsheviks, should, be, terminated, and, peace, negotiations, should, commence, the, pursuit, of, peace, also, dominated, popular, sentiments, and, anti, war, demonstrations, had, taken, place, the, leadership, of, soviet, russia, confronted, at, that, time, a, number, of, pressing, internal, and, external, problems, in, order, to, effectively, address, the, difficulties, they, wanted, to, stop, the, warfare, and, offer, peace, to, their, neighbors, hoping, to, be, able, to, come, out, of, the, international, isolation, they, had, been, subjected, to, courted, by, the, soviets, the, potential, allies, of, poland, lithuania, latvia, romania, or, the, south, caucasus, states, were, unwilling, to, join, a, polish, led, anti, soviet, alliance, faced, with, the, diminishing, revolutionary, fervor, in, europe, the, soviets, were, inclined, to, delay, their, hallmark, project, a, soviet, republic, of, europe, to, some, indefinite, future, the, peace, offers, sent, to, warsaw, by, russia, s, foreign, secretary, georgy, chicherin, and, other, russian, governing, institutions, between, late, december, 1919, and, early, february, 1920, had, not, been, responded, to, the, soviets, proposed, a, favorable, for, poland, troop, demarcation, line, consistent, with, the, current, military, frontiers, leaving, permanent, border, determinations, for, later, while, the, soviet, overtures, generated, considerable, interests, on, the, parts, of, the, socialist, agrarian, and, nationalist, political, camps, the, attempts, of, the, polish, sejm, to, prevent, further, warfare, turned, futile, pi, sudski, who, ruled, over, the, military, and, to, a, considerable, degree, over, the, weak, civilian, government, prevented, any, movement, toward, peace, by, late, february, he, directed, the, polish, representatives, to, engage, in, pretended, negotiations, with, the, soviets, pi, sudski, and, his, collaborators, stressed, what, they, saw, as, the, increasing, with, time, polish, military, advantage, over, the, red, army, and, their, belief, that, the, state, of, war, had, created, highly, favorable, conditions, for, poland, s, economic, development, on, 4, march, 1920, general, w, adys, aw, sikorski, initiated, a, new, offensive, in, polesia, the, polish, forces, had, driven, a, wedge, between, soviet, forces, to, the, north, belarus, and, south, ukraine, the, soviet, counter, offensive, in, polesia, and, volhynia, was, pushed, back, polish, russian, peace, negotiations, in, march, 1920, produced, no, results, pi, sudski, was, not, interested, in, a, negotiated, solution, to, the, conflict, preparations, for, a, large, scale, resumption, of, hostilities, were, being, finalized, and, the, newly, declared, over, the, protest, of, a, majority, of, parliamentary, deputies, marshal, and, his, circle, expected, the, planned, new, offensive, to, lead, to, the, fulfillment, of, pi, sudski, s, federalist, ideas, on, 7, april, chicherin, accused, poland, of, rejecting, the, soviet, peace, offer, and, notified, the, allies, of, the, negative, developments, urging, them, to, prevent, the, forthcoming, polish, aggression, the, polish, diplomacy, claimed, the, necessity, to, counteract, the, immediate, threat, of, a, soviet, assault, in, belarus, but, the, western, opinion, to, whom, the, soviet, arguments, seemed, reasonable, rejected, the, polish, narrative, the, soviet, forces, on, the, belarusian, front, were, weak, at, the, time, and, the, bolsheviks, had, no, plans, for, an, offensive, action, having, resolved, poland, s, armed, conflicts, with, the, emerging, ukrainian, states, to, poland, s, satisfaction, pi, sudski, was, able, to, work, on, a, polish, ukrainian, alliance, against, russia, on, 2, december, 1919, andriy, livytskyi, and, other, ukrainian, diplomats, declared, their, readiness, to, give, up, the, ukrainian, claims, to, eastern, galicia, and, western, volhynia, in, return, for, poland, s, recognition, of, the, independence, of, the, ukrainian, people, s, republic, upr, the, treaty, of, warsaw, pi, sudski, s, agreement, with, hetman, symon, petliura, the, exiled, ukrainian, nationalist, leader, and, two, other, members, of, the, directorate, of, ukraine, was, signed, on, 21, april, 1920, it, appeared, to, be, pi, sudski, s, major, success, potentially, signifying, the, beginning, of, a, successful, implementation, of, his, long, held, designs, petliura, who, formally, represented, the, government, of, the, ukrainian, people, s, republic, which, had, de, facto, been, defeated, by, the, bolsheviks, fled, with, some, ukrainian, troops, to, poland, where, he, found, political, asylum, his, control, extended, only, to, a, sliver, of, land, near, the, polish, controlled, areas, petliura, had, therefore, little, choice, but, to, accept, the, polish, offer, of, alliance, largely, on, polish, terms, as, determined, by, the, outcome, of, the, recent, warfare, between, the, two, nations, by, concluding, an, agreement, with, pi, sudski, petliura, accepted, the, polish, territorial, gains, in, western, ukraine, and, the, future, polish, ukrainian, border, along, the, zbruch, river, in, exchange, for, renouncing, the, ukrainian, territorial, claims, he, was, promised, independence, for, ukraine, and, polish, military, assistance, in, reinstating, his, government, in, kiev, given, the, powerful, opposition, against, pi, sudski, s, eastern, policy, in, war, tired, poland, the, negotiations, with, petliura, were, conducted, in, secrecy, and, the, text, of, the, 21, april, agreement, remained, secret, poland, recognized, in, it, ukraine, s, right, to, parts, of, the, former, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, before, 1772, east, of, the, zbruch, a, military, convention, was, added, on, 24, april, it, placed, ukrainian, units, under, polish, command, by, 1, may, a, polish, ukrainian, trade, agreement, was, negotiated, it, had, not, been, signed, to, prevent, its, far, ranging, provisions, anticipating, exploitation, of, ukraine, by, poland, from, being, revealed, and, from, causing, catastrophic, damage, to, petliura, s, political, reputation, for, pi, sudski, the, alliance, gave, his, campaign, for, the, intermarium, federation, an, actual, starting, point, and, potentially, the, most, important, federation, partner, satisfied, his, demands, regarding, parts, of, polish, eastern, border, relevant, to, the, proposed, ukrainian, state, and, laid, a, foundation, for, a, polish, dominated, ukrainian, state, between, russia, and, poland, according, to, richard, k, debo, while, petliura, could, not, contribute, real, strength, to, the, polish, offensive, for, pi, sudski, the, alliance, provided, some, camouflage, for, the, naked, aggression, involved, for, petliura, it, was, the, final, chance, to, preserve, the, ukrainian, statehood, and, at, least, a, theoretical, independence, of, the, ukrainian, heartlands, despite, his, acceptance, of, the, loss, of, west, ukrainian, lands, to, poland, the, british, and, the, french, did, not, recognize, the, upr, and, blocked, its,

in, their, respective, countries, pi, sudski, faced, stiff, opposition, from, roman, dmowski, s, national, democrats, who, opposed, ukrainian, independence, to, protest, the, alliance, and, the, upcoming, war, over, ukraine, stanis, aw, grabski, resigned, the, chairmanship, of, the, foreign, affairs, committee, in, the, sejm, where, the, national, democrats, were, a, dominant, force, their, approval, would, be, needed, to, finalize, any, future, political, settlement, petliura, was, criticized, by, many, ukrainian, politicians, for, entering, a, pact, with, the, poles, and, for, abandoning, western, ukraine, after, the, destruction, of, the, west, ukrainian, people, s, republic, western, ukraine, was, from, their, point, of, view, occupied, by, poland, during, their, occupation, of, the, territory, meant, for, the, upr, polish, officials, engaged, in, forced, requisitions, some, of, which, were, intended, for, troop, supply, but, also, in, extensive, looting, of,

were, captured, in, great, numbers, from, the, white, russians, and, the, allied, expeditionary, forces, during, the, russian, civil, war, still, they, suffered, a, shortage, of, arms, as, both, the,

audience, that, the, polish, army, would, only, stay, as, long, as, necessary, until, a, legal, ukrainian, government, took, control, over, its, own, territory, however, although, many, ukrainians,

lenin, understood, the, importance, of, the, appeal, to, russian, nationalism, the, soviet, counteroffensive, was, indeed, boosted, by, brusilov, s, involvement, 14, 000, officers, and, over, 100, 000, soldiers, of, lower, ranks, enlisted, in, or, returned, to, the, red, army, thousands, of, civilian, volunteers, contributed, to, the, war, effort, as, well, the, 3rd, army, and, other, polish,

troops, backed, by, some, 460, artillery, pieces, with, no, strategic, reserves, this, approach, to, holding, ground, harked, back, to, the, world, war, i, practice, of, establishing, a, fortified, line, of, defense, the, polish, soviet, front, however, bore, little, resemblance, to, that, war, s, conditions, as, it, was, weakly, manned, supported, with, inadequate, artillery, and, had, almost, no, fortifications, such, arrangement, allowed, the, soviets, to, attain, numerical, superiority, at, strategically, crucial, locations, against, the, polish, line, the, red, army, gathered, its, western, front, led, by, tukhachevsky, its, numbers, exceeded, 108, 000, infantry, and, 11, 000, cavalry, supported, by, 722, artillery, pieces, and, 2, 913, machine, guns, according, to, chwalba,

and, better, prepared, soviet, second, northern, offensive, was, launched, on, 4, july, along, the, smolensk, brest, axis, and, crossed, the, avuta, and, the, berezina, rivers, important, role, was, played, by, the, 3rd, cavalry, corps, known, as, the, assault, army, and, led, by, hayk, bzhishkyan, on, the, first, day, of, fighting, the, polish, first, and, second, lines, of, defense, were, overpowered, and, on, 5, july, the, polish, forces, commenced, a, full, and, quick, retreat, along, the, entire, front, the, combat, strength, of, the, first, polish, army, was, reduced, by, 46, during, the, first, week, of, fighting, the, retreat, soon, turned, into, a, chaotic, and, disorganized, flight, on, 9, july, lithuania, s, talks, with, the, soviets, commenced, the, lithuanians,

the, south, in, eastern, galicia, budyonny, s, cavalry, approached, brody, lw, w, and, zamo, it, had, become, clear, to, the, poles, that, the, soviet, objectives, were, not, limited, to, countering, the, effects, of, the, kiev, offensive, but, that, poland, s, independent, existence, was, at, stake, the, soviet, armies, moved, toward, the, west, at, a, remarkable, speed, carrying, out, a, bold, maneuver, bzhishkyan, took, grodno, on, 19, july, the, strategically, important, and, easy, to, defend, osowiec, fortress, was, captured, by, bzhishkyan, s, 3rd, cavalry, corps, on, 27, july, bia,

to, defend, the, bug, river, line, reached, by, the, russians, on, 30, july, but, the, quick, loss, of, the, brest, fortress, forced, a, cancellation, of, pi, sudski, s, plans, on, the, same, day, polish, forces, delayed, the, soviet, offensive, in, the, battle, of, abinka, after, crossing, the, narew, river, on, 2, august, the, western, front, was, only, about, 100, km, 62, mi, from, warsaw, by, that, time, however, polish, resistance, intensified, the, shortened, front, facilitated, greater, concentrations, of, polish, troops, involved, in, defensive, operations, they, were, being, constantly, reinforced, due, to, the, closeness, of, polish, population, centers, and, the, influx, of, volunteers, polish, supply, lines, had, become, short, while, the, opposite, was, true, regarding, the, enemy, logistics, as, general, sosnkowski, was, able, to, generate, and, energize, 170, 000, new, polish, soldiers, within, a, few, weeks, tukhachevsky, noted, that, instead, of, quickly, concluding, their, mission, as, expected, his, force, encountered, determined, resistance, the, southwestern, front, pushed, the, polish, forces, out, of, most, of, ukraine, stalin, thwarted, sergey, kamenev, s, orders, and, directed, the, formations, under, budyonny, s, command, to, close, on, zamo, and, lw, w, the, largest, city, in, eastern, galicia, and, garrison, of, the, polish, 6th, army, the, protracted, battle, of, lw, w, began, in, july, 1920, stalin, s, action, was, detrimental, to, the, situation, of, the, forces, of, tukhachevsky, in, the, north, since, tukhachevsky, needed, relief, from, budyonny, near, warsaw, where, in, august, decisive, battles, were, fought, instead, of, performing, a, concentric, attack, on, warsaw, the, two, soviet, fronts, were, getting, further, apart, pi, sudski, used, the, resulting, void, to, launch, his, counteroffensive, on, 16, august, during, the, battle, of, warsaw, fighting, the, battle, of, brody, and, berestechko, 29, july, 3, august, the, polish, forces, attempted, to, stop, budyonny, s, advance, on, lw, w, but, the, effort, was, terminated, by, pi, sudski, who, mustered, two, divisions, to, take, part, in, the, approaching, struggle, for, the, polish, capital, on, 1, august, 1920, polish, and, soviet, delegations, met, at, baranavichy, and, exchanged, notes, but, their, armistice, talks, produced, no, results, the, western, allies, were, critical, of, polish, politics, and, unhappy, with, poland, s, refusal, to, cooperate, with, the, allied, intervention, in, the, russian, civil, war, but, they, supported, the, polish, forces, fighting, the, red, army, nevertheless, shipping, to, poland, armaments, extending, credits, and, supporting, the, country, politically, france, was, especially, disappointed, but, also, particularly, interested, in, defeating, the, bolsheviks, so, poland, was, a, natural, ally, in, this, respect, british, politicians, represented, a, gamut, of, opinions, on, the, polish, russian, issue, but, many, were, highly, critical, of, polish, policies, and, actions, in, january, 1920, the, united, states, secretary, of, war, newton, d, baker, accused, poland, of, conducting, imperial, politics, at, the, expense, of, russia, in, early, spring, 1920, the, allies, irritated, by, the, polish, conduct, considered, the, idea, of, transferring, the, lands, east, of, the, bug, river, to, allied, control, under, auspices, of, the, league, of, nations, in, autumn, 1919, the, british, government, of, prime, minister, david, lloyd, george, agreed, to, provide, arms,

the, polish, government, the, initial, success, of, the, kiev, offensive, caused, enormous, euphoria, in, poland, and, pi, sudski, s, leading, role, was, recognized, by, most, politicians, however, with, the, tide, turning, against, poland, pi, sudski, s, political, power, weakened, and, that, of, his, opponents, including, roman, dmowski, rose, the, government, of, leopold, skulski, pi, sudski,

weygand, becoming, top, military, commander, in, the, war, it, was, not, allowed, and, general, weygand, accepted, an, advisory, position, the, dispatch, of, the, allied, mission, to, warsaw, was, a, proof, that, the, west, had, not, given, up, on, poland, and, gave, the, poles, a, reason, to, believe, that, not, all, was, lost, the, mission, members, made, a, significant, contribution, to, the, war, effort, however, the, crucial, battle, of, warsaw, was, fought, and, won, primarily, by, the, poles, many, in, the, west, erroneously, believed, that, it, was, the, timely, arrival, of, the, allies, that, had, saved, poland, weygand, occupied, the, central, role, in, the, myth, that, was, created, as, polish, french, cooperation, continued, french, weaponry, including, infantry, armament,

polish, soviet, negotiations, polish, ministry, of, foreign, affairs, paid, particular, attention, to, keeping, the, allies, informed, of, their, course, and, making, them, feel, co, responsible, for, the, outcome, the, soviet, emphasis, had, gradually, shifted, from, promoting, world, revolution, to, dismantling, the, treaty, of, versailles, system, which, in, lenin, s, words, was, the, treaty, of, the, triumphant, world, imperialism, lenin, made, remarks, to, that, effect, during, the, 9th, conference, of, the, russian, communist, party, rkp, b, convened, on, 22, 25, september, 1920, he, repeatedly, referred, to, the, soviet, military, defeat, for, which, he, indirectly, held, himself, largely, responsible, trotsky, and, stalin, blamed, each, other, for, the, war, s, outcome, stalin, sharply, rebutted, lenin, s, accusations, regarding, stalin, s, judgement, ahead, of, the, battle, of, warsaw, as, lenin, saw, it, the, conquest, of, warsaw, not, very, important, in, itself, would, have, allowed, the, soviets, to, demolish, the, versailles, european, order, according, to, the, plan, of, the, commander, in, chief, of, the, red, army, kamenev, as, of, 20, july, 1920, two, soviet, fronts, western, and, southwestern, were, going, to, execute, a, concentric, attack, on, warsaw, however, after, consulting, tukhachevsky, the, western, front, commander, kamenev, concluded, that, the, western, front, alone, could, manage, the, occupation, of, warsaw, tukhachevsky, s, intention, was, to, destroy, the, polish, armies, in, the, region, of, warsaw, his, plan, was, to, have, one, of, his, armies, attack, the, polish, capital, from, the, east, while, three, other, were, to, force, their, way, across, the, vistula, further, north, between, modlin, and, toru, parts, of, this, formation, were, going, to, be, used, to, outflank, warsaw, from, the, west, he, issued, orders, to, this, effect, on, 8, august, it, had, soon, become, apparent, to, tukhachevsky, that, his, designs, were, not, producing, the, desired, result, the, southwestern, front, was, given, the, task, of, attacking, lw, w, accordingly, and, in, agreement, with, his, own, previously, expressed, views, stalin, member, of, the, revolutionary, council, of, the, southwestern, front, directed, budyonny, to, unleash, an, assault, on, lw, w, aimed, at, taking, the, city, budyonny, s, 1st, cavalry, army, and, other, southwestern, front, forces, were, originally, supposed, to, head, north, in, the, direction, of, brest, to, execute, together, with, tukhachevsky, s, armies, an, assault, on, warsaw, budyonny, s, forces, fought, in, the, vicinity, of, lw, w, until, 19, august, in, the, meantime, already, on, 11, august, kamenev, ordered, the, 1st, cavalry, army, and, the, 12th, army, of, the, southwestern, front, to, proceed, in, the, northwestern, direction, toward, the, western, front, area, to, fight, there, under, tukhachevsky, s, command, kamenev, repeated, his, order, on, 13, august, but, budyonny, following, stalin, s, directives, refused, to, obey, on, 13, august, tukhachevsky, in, vain, pleaded, with, kamenev, to, expedite, the, redirecting, of, both, southwestern, armies, to, his, area, of, combat, such, circumstances, led, to, a, soviet, disadvantage, as, the, crucial, battle, of, warsaw, was, about, to, unfold, trotsky, interpreted, stalin, s, actions, as, insubordination, but, the, historian, richard, pipes, asserts, that, stalin, almost, certainly, acted, on, lenin, s, orders, in, not, moving, the, forces, toward, warsaw, according, to, stalin, s, biographer, duraczy, ski, stalin, despite, his, devotion, to, lenin, displayed, a, great, deal, of, initiative, and, boldness, unlike, other, soviet, officials, including, lenin, he, had, not, become, euphoric, about, the, soviet, victories, however, he, insisted, on, the, exceptional, importance, of, the, activities, of, the, southwestern, front, which, turned, out, to, be, costly, for, the, soviets, stalin, may, have, been, motivated, by, the, letter, lenin, wrote, to, him, on, 23, july, regarding, the, defeat, of, the, polish, armies, as, already, practically, accomplished, the, soviet, leader, suggested, a, redirection, of, main, soviet, efforts, toward, the, south, west, into, romania, hungary, austria, and, ultimately, italy, stalin, agreed, and, he, saw, the, conquest, of, lw, w, on, the, way, as, fitting, well, with, the, overall, scheme, tukhachevsky, later, blamed, stalin, for, his, defeat, at, the, battle, of, warsaw, pi, sudski, had, his, counteroffensive, plan, figured, by, 6, august, he, resolved, to, reinforce, the, warsaw, and, modlin, region, tie, up, the, soviet, assault, forces, there, and, then, use, the, divisions, taken, from, the, front, and, others, in, a, risky, maneuver, of, attacking, the, rear, of, tukhachevsky, s, forces, from, the, wieprz, river, area, the, soviets, found, a, copy, of, pi, sudski, s, order, but, tukhachevsky, thought, it, to, be, a, hoax, in, the, final, parade, pi, sudski, received, before, the, attack, about, half, of, his, worn, out, and, undersupplied, soldiers, marched, barefoot, in, august, 1919, polish, military, intelligence, first, decrypted, the, red, army, s, radio, messages, from, the, spring, of, 1920, the, polish, high, command, had, been, aware, of, current, soviet, moves, and, plans, which, may, have, had, decisively, influenced, the, outcome, of, the, war, on, 8, august, 1920, tukhachevsky, ordered, some, of, the, soviet, forces, to, cross, the, vistula, river, in, the, area, of, toru, and, p,

into, two, parts, the, soviet, advance, toward, warsaw, and, modlin, was, halted, and, had, soon, turned, into, a, retreat, which, contributed, to, the, success, of, the, drive, by, the, main, polish,

belarusian, soviet, republics, was, of, utmost, importance, and, their, recognition, was, the, most, fateful, concession, the, polish, negotiators, had, made, the, anglo, soviet, trade, agreement, signed, on, 16, march, 1921, was, the, first, of, a, series, of, such, international, treaties, it, broke, diplomatic, isolation, of, soviet, russia, the, resulting, influx, of, foreign, arms, and, equipment, contributed, to, the, success, of, the, offensive, against, the, partisans, in, the, tambov, province, executed, by, tukhachevsky, and, completed, by, july, the, grain, requisition, practices, were, eventually, replaced, by, the, new, economic, policy, announced, by, lenin, on, 23, march, 1921, it, represented, a, partial, compromise, with, capitalism, on, 16, april, 1922,

world, their, losses, during, and, after, the, battle, of, warsaw, made, the, soviets, offer, the, polish, peace, delegation, substantial, territorial, concessions, including, minsk, and, other, areas, occupied, by, polish, forces, polish, resources, were, also, exhausted, and, polish, public, opinion, wanted, a, settlement, pi, sudski, and, his, camp, were, opposed, to, the, peace, process, and, wanted, the, warfare, to, continue, to, make, a, realization, of, the, intermarium, concept, possible, fulfilment, of, pi, sudski, s, territorial, and, political, ideas, was, precluded, already, on, 11, september, 1920, when, the, defense, council, voted, on, poland, s, border, expectations, despite, the, positive, outcome, of, the, battle, of, warsaw, pi, sudski, s, political, position, remained, weak, and, he, was, unable, to, prevent, developments, that, meant, ruin, to, his, long, held, vision, of, a, grand, polish, led, alliance, the, negotiations, were, controlled, by, dmowski, s, national, democrats, the, national, democrats, wanted, to, directly, incorporate, into, the, polish, state, the, lands, they, found, desirable, the, sejm, was, controlled, by, dmowski, s, allies, whose, ideas, on, the, nature, of, the, polish, state, and, the, arrangement, of, its, borders, had, since, permanently, prevailed, because, of, the, failed, kiev, expedition, pi, sudski, had, lost, his, ability, to, act, as, the, main, player, to, manipulate, people, and, events, in, polish, politics, the, consensus, on, his, dominant, role, was, gone, as, a, consequence, he, was, allowed, to, win, the, war, but, the, conditions, of, peace, were, determined, already, by, his, opponents, the, national, democrats, led, at, the, riga, talks, by, stanis, aw, grabski, wanted, only, the, territory, they, viewed, as, ethnically, or, historically, polish, had, polish, dominated, cities, or, in, their, opinion, could, be, polonised, in, the, east, polish, culture, was, weakly, represented, even, in, the, cities, except, for, a, few, in, the, western, part, of, the, disputed, territories, and, grabski, refrained, from, seeking, a, border, along, the, so, called, dmowski, s, line, previously, promoted, by, his, movement, despite, the, red, army, s, defeat, and, the, willingness, of, the, chief, soviet, negotiator, adolph, joffe, to, concede, most, of, the, areas, occupied, by, polish, troops, the, national, democratic, politics, allowed, the, soviets, to, regain, some, of, the, territories, acquired, by, the, polish, armies, during, the, campaign, the, national, democrats, worried, that, poland, would, not, be, able, to, control, overly, extended, territories, dominated, by, national, minorities, grabski, wanted, lands, where, poles, could, predominate, among, the, territories, evacuated, by, the, polish, army, were, minsk, in, the, north, and, kamianets, podilskyi, and, other, areas, east, of, the, zbruch, river, in, the, south, the, grabski, corridor, a, strip, of, land, inserted, to, separate, lithuania, from, russia, and, connect, poland, to, latvia, made, pi, sudski, s, so, called, eligowski, s, mutiny, and, the, polish, annexation, of, the, vilnius, area, possible, the, national, democrats, were, also, conscious, of, the, weakening, of, their, electoral, position, that, would, result, from, annexing, more, territories, dominated, by, non, polish, ethnic, groups, the, failed, federalist, orientation, was, represented, at, riga, by, pi, sudski, s, associate, leon, wasilewski, in, the, long, run, the, national, democrats, scheme, had, not, quite, worked, because, the, riga, settlement, created, a, poland, which, was, too, westerly, to, be, a, federation, but, not, westerly, enough, to, remain, a, national, state, poland, ended, up, with, the, largest, total, percentage, of, ethnic, minorities, of, any, unitary, state, in, interwar, europe, only, about, two, thirds, of, polish, citizens, considered, themselves, ethnically, polish, or, of, polish, nationality, still, the, refusal, of, the, easternmost, areas, considered, was, beneficial, to, the, national, democrats, electoral, prospects, the, resolution, of, the, war, had, thus, dealt, a, death, blow, to, the, intermarium, project, one, consequence, of, the, outcome, of, the, polish, soviet, war, was, that, poland, s, elites, acquired, an, exaggerated, perspective, of, the, country, s, military, capabilities, this, point, of, view, was, not, shared, by, western, observers, who, stressed, that, poland, was, able, to, defend, itself, only, because, of, the, financial, logistic, and, material, support, from, the, allies, 99, 000, polish, soldiers, died, or, went, missing, and, the, country, suffered, enormous, other, losses, and, destruction, the, peace, of, riga, partitioned, ukraine, and, gave, a, portion, of, its, territory, to, poland, eastern, galicia, and, most, of, volhynia, and, the, other, portion, to, the, soviets, the, ukrainian, soviet, republic, and, the, byelorussian, soviet, republic, were, recognized, by, poland, historian, timothy, snyder, writes, that, the, soviet, union, established, in, 1922, included, a, ukrainian, ssr, was, the, most, important, consequence, of, the, attempts, to, establish, an, independent, ukrainian, state, in, 1918, 1920, the, treaty, of, warsaw, between, poland, and, the, directorate, of, ukraine, had, been, invalidated, the, riga, treaty, violated, the, spirit, of, poland, s, prior, alliance, with, the, ukrainian, people, s, republic, from, the, beginning, of, the, talks, the, polish, side, de, facto, recognized, the, ukrainian, ssr, and, the, armistice, agreement, stipulated, termination, of, support, for, foreign, forces, allied, against, the, other, side, members, of, the, ukrainian, faction, that, accepted, the, alliance, with, poland, and, fought, within, that, alliance, were, now, interned, by, the, polish, authorities, the, peace, negotiations, and, their, outcome, were, condemned, and, bitterly, criticized, by, ukrainian, politicians, and, military, leaders, as, polish, democracy, was, alien, unrepresentative, and, eventually, curtailed, great, resentment, had, been, generated, in, the, remaining, interwar, years, because, of, repressive, policies, of, polish, governments, towards, ukrainians, living, in, post, riga, poland, in, the, 1920s, the, soviet, policy, was, to, help, create, a, modern, ukrainian, culture, ukrainian, intellectuals, co, opted, by, the, communist, party, were, encouraged, to, create, in, the, ukrainian, language, and, the, result, was, cultural, revival, and, a, period, of, great, productivity, children, were, educated, and, most, books, and, newspapers, were, published, in, the, native, language, the, ukrainian, autocephalous, orthodox, church, was, established, the, liberal, policies, ended, under, stalin, s, rule, when, the, new, church, was, banned, and, the, ukrainian, intelligentsia, destroyed, in, massive, purges, given, the, circumstances, in, the, 1930s, poland, s, eastern, galicia, had, become, the, center, of, ukrainian, political, and, cultural, activity, despite, the, atrocities, that, took, place, in, soviet, ukraine, poland, was, regarded, by, ukrainian, activists, as, the, principal, enemy, they, felt, disappointed, by, the, failed, alliance, and, the, peace, of, riga, and, were, annoyed, by, daily, domination, of, the, polish, authorities, and, local, polish, elites, many, perceived, the, soviet, union, primarily, as, the, creator, of, a, ukrainian, state, the, ukrainian, ssr, on, 11, july, 1920, soviet, forces, entered, minsk, and, on, 1, august, the, byelorussian, soviet, socialist, republic, was, officially, established, belarus, like, ukraine, was, partitioned, between, poland, and, the, soviet, union, after, the, peace, of, riga, the, policies, of, the, byelorussian, soviet, republic, were, determined, by, moscow, unlike, in, the, cases, of, lithuania, and, ukraine, pi, sudski, or, his, allies, had, not, proposed, a, belarusian, state, associated, with, poland, until, the, riga, talks, when, they, wanted, to, claim, minsk, as, capital, of, a, belarusian, people, s, republic, in, that, role, like, the, ukrainian, petliura, s, forces, in, belarus, the, volunteer, allied, army, under, general, stanis, aw, bu, ak,

into, polish, controlled, territory, on, 28, november, the, belarusian, soldiers, were, also, interned, by, the, polish, authorities, belarusian, activists, regarded, the, peace, of, riga, results, as, a, tragic, betrayal, without, minsk, polish, belarusians, were, reduced, to, being, a, mostly, rural, marginalized, group, to, many, of, them, the, soviet, republic, to, the, east, seemed, an, attractive, alternative, in, 1922, the, soviet, union, was, established, as, a, formal, federation, of, republics, its, policy, called, for, an, eventual, extension, of, the, byelorussian, ssr, to, include, the, belarusian, lands, under, polish, administration, the, communist, party, of, western, belorussia, established, in, poland, was, under, soviet, control, the, territory, of, the, byelorussian, ssr, was, extended, to, the, east, in, 1923, 1924, and, 1926, by, lands, taken, from, the, russian, republic, in, contrast, to, the, repressive, polish, policies, in, the, 1920s, the, soviet, union, supported, belarusian, culture, several, major, national, institutions, and, thousands, of, belarusian, schools, had, been, established, however, the, official, belarusian, progress,

consequences, for, belarus, vera, maslovskaya, was, sent, there, as, the, delegate, of, the, bia, ystok, area, and, she, proposed, a, resolution, to, fight, for, the, unification, of, belarus, she, sought, independence, of, all, belarusian, lands, and, denounced, the, partition, though, the, convention, did, not, adopt, a, proposal, instituting, armed, conflict, it, passed, maslovskaya, s, proposal, which, led, to, immediate, retaliation, from, the, polish, authorities, they, infiltrated, the, underground, network, fighting, for, belarusian, unification, and, arrested, the, participants, maslovskaya, was, arrested, in, 1922, and, tried, in, 1923, along, with, 45, other, participants, mostly, peasants, among, the, arrested, were, also, a, sister, and, brother, of, maslovskaya, and, several, teachers, and, professionals, maslovskaya, accepted, all, responsibility, for, the, underground, organisation, but, specifically, stated, that, she, was, guilty, of, no, crime, having, acted, only, to, protect, the, interests, of, belarus, against, foreign, occupiers, in, a, political, and, not, military, action, unable, to, prove, that, the, leaders, had,
