ottoman, victory, the, byzantine, ottoman, wars, were, a, series, of, decisive, conflicts, between, the, byzantine, greeks, and, ottoman, turks, and, their, allies, that, led, to, the, final, destruction, of, the, byzantine, empire, and, the, rise, of, the, ottoman, empire, the, byzantines, already, having, been, in, a, weak, state, even, before, the, partitioning, of, their, empire, following, the, 4th, crusade, failed, to, recover, fully, under, the, rule, of, the, palaiologos, dynasty, thus, the, byzantines, faced, increasingly, disastrous, defeats, at, the, hands, of, the, ottomans, ultimately, they, lost, constantinople, in, 1453, formally, ending, the, conflicts, however, several, byzantine, holdouts, lasted, until, 1479, taking, advantage, of, the, situation, the, seljuk, sultanate, of, rum, began, seizing, territory, in, western, anatolia, until, the, nicaean, empire, was, able, to, repulse, the, seljuk, turks, from, the, remaining, territories, still, under, byzantine, rule, eventually, constantinople, was, re, taken, from, the, latin, empire, in, 1261, by, the, nicaean, empire, the, position, of, the, byzantine, empire, in, europe, remained, uncertain, due, to, the, presence, of, the, rivals, in, epirus, serbia, and, bulgaria, this, combined, with, the, declining, power, of, the, sultanate, of, rum, byzantium, s, chief, rival, in, asia, minor, led, to, the, removal, of, troops, from, anatolia, to, maintain, byzantium, s, grip, on, thrace, the, decay, of, the, sultanate, of, rum, brought, unexpected, instability, to, the, anatolian, frontier, as, nobles, known, as, ghazis, began, setting, up, fiefdoms, at, the, expense, of, the, byzantine, empire, while, many, turkish, beys, participated, in, the, conquest, of, byzantine, and, seljuk, territory, the, territories, under, the, control, of, one, such, bey, osman, i, posed, the, greatest, threat, to, nicaea, and, to, constantinople, within, 90, years, of, osman, i, s, establishment, of, the, ottoman, beylik, the, byzantines, lost, all, of, their, anatolian, territory, and, by, 1400, byzantine, thrace, was, also, lost, to, the, ottomans, the, crusade, of, nicopolis, in, 1396, timur, s, invasion, of, 1402, and, the, crusade, of, varna, in, 1444, allowed, a, ruined, constantinople, to, stave, off, defeat, until, it, finally, fell, in, 1453, after, having, taken, the, city, ottoman, supremacy, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, was, largely, secured, following, the, byzantine, reconquest, of, constantinople, in, 1261, the, byzantine, empire, was, left, in, an, isolated, position, there, was, plenty, of, talk, among, the, remaining, latin, duchies, of, the, greek, mainland, and, other, regions, of, retaking, constantinople, for, the, latin, empire, whilst, to, the, north, another, significant, threat, came, from, serbian, expansion, into, the, balkans, by, king, stefan, uro, i, what, was, once, a, strong, frontier, under, the, komnenian, dynasty, at, the, danube, river, now, threatened, constantinople, itself, to, solve, these, problems, michael, viii, began, consolidating, his, rule, he, had, the, younger, co, emperor, john, iv, blinded, which, resulted, in, much, resentment, to, counter, this, the, byzantine, emperor, installed, a, new, patriarch, of, constantinople, germanus, iii, ordering, him, to, lift, an, excommunication, that, had, been, placed, against, him, by, the, former, patriarch, arsenios, autoreianos, and, to, submit, to, the, authority, of, rome, in, order, to, alleviate, the, latin, threat, as, the, byzantine, empire, continued, the, conquest, of, latin, territory, the, turks, under, osman, i, began, their, raids, into, byzantine, anatolia, s, t, and, eski, ehir, were, taken, in, 1265, and, 1289, respectively, michael, palaiologos, was, unable, to, deal, with, these, early, setbacks, due, to, the, need, to, transfer, troops, to, the, west, in, 1282, michael, palaiologos, died, and, his, son, andronikos, ii, took, power, the, death, of, the, old, byzantine, emperor, came, as, a, relief, for, the, society, at, large, his, policy, of, latin, appeasement, to, the, church, in, rome, heavy, taxation, and, military, expenditure, placed, a, severe, burden, on, the, people, as, the, ottoman, turks, began, taking, land, from, the, empire, they, were, seen, as, liberators, of, anatolians, and, many, soon, converted, to, islam, undermining, the, byzantine, s, orthodox, power, base, andronikos, rule, was, marked, by, incompetence, and, short, sighted, decisions, that, in, the, long, run, would, damage, the, byzantine, empire, beyond, repair, he, began, to, debase, the, byzantine, hyperpyron, resulting, in, a, reduction, of, the, value, of, the, byzantine, economy, taxes, were, decreased, for, the, powerful, i, e, landed, aristocracy, and, instead, placed, upon, the, knight, class, pronoia, to, popularize, his, rule, he, repudiated, the, union, of, the, orthodox, and, catholic, churches, decreed, by, the, second, council, of, lyon, in, 1274, thereby, further, increasing, hostilities, between, the, latins, and, the, byzantines, andronikos, ii, took, a, deep, interest, in, preserving, the, anatolian, lands, of, byzantium, and, ordered, construction, of, forts, in, asia, minor, and, vigorous, training, of, the, army, the, byzantine, emperor, ordered, that, his, court, be, moved, to, anatolia, to, oversee, the, campaigns, there, and, instructed, his, general, alexios, philanthropenos, to, push, back, the, turks, early, successes, were, rendered, useless, when, alexios, staged, an, unsuccessful, coup, leading, to, his, blinding, and, the, end, of, his, campaigns, this, allowed, the, ottomans, to, lay, siege, to, nicaea, in, 1301, a, further, defeat, on, andronikos, son, michael, ix, and, the, byzantine, general, george, mouzalon, occurred, at, magnesia, and, bapheus, in, 1302, despite, this, andronikos, tried, once, more, to, strike, a, decisive, blow, back, at, the, turks, this, time, hiring, catalan, mercenaries, under, the, guidance, of, michael, ix, and, the, leadership, of, roger, de, flor, the, 6, 500, strong, catalan, company, in, the, spring, and, summer, of, 1303, managed, to, drive, back, the, turks, the, mercenaries, onslaught, drove, the, turks, back, from, philadelphia, to, cyzicus, in, the, process, causing, great, destruction, to, the, anatolian, landscape, once, again, these, gains, were, thwarted, by, internal, matters, roger, de, flor, was, assassinated, and, in, revenge, his, company, began, pillaging, the, anatolian, countryside, when, they, finally, left, in, 1307, to, attack, byzantine, thrace, the, locals, welcomed, the, ottomans, who, once, again, began, blockading, key, fortresses, in, asia, minor, the, ottomans, were, able, to, build, on, their, military, success, due, to, the, numerous, divisions, amongst, their, opponents, many, of, the, peasant, classes, in, anatolia, saw, the, ottomans, as, better, masters, after, these, defeats, andronikos, was, in, no, position, to, send, substantial, forces, in, 1320, andronikos, ii, s, grandson, andronikos, iii, was, disinherited, following, the, death, of, his, father, michael, ix, the, emperor, s, son, and, heir, apparent, the, following, year, andronikos, iii, retaliated, by, marching, on, constantinople, and, was, given, thrace, as, an, appanage, he, kept, on, pressing, for, his, inheritance, and, in, 1322, was, made, co, emperor, this, culminated, in, the, byzantine, civil, war, of, 1321, 1328, in, which, serbia, backed, andronikos, ii, and, the, bulgarians, backed, his, grandson, eventually, andronikos, iii, emerged, triumphant, on, may, 23, 1328, as, andronikos, iii, consolidated, his, hold, on, byzantium, the, ottomans, succeeded, in, taking, bursa, from, the, byzantines, in, 1326, the, fate, of, nicaea, was, sealed, when, the, byzantine, relief, army, was, defeated, at, pelekanos, on, 10, june, 1329, in, 1331, nicaea, surrendered, resulting, in, a, massive, blow, due, to, its, strategic, position, relative, to, constantinople, once, again, the, byzantines, military, power, was, depleted, and, andronikos, iii, were, forced, into, diplomacy, as, his, grandfather, was, before, him, in, return, for, the, safety, of, the, remaining, byzantine, settlements, in, asia, minor, tribute, would, be, paid, to, the, ottomans, unfortunately, for, the, byzantine, empire, this, did, not, stop, the, ottomans, from, laying, siege, to, nicomedia, in, 1333, the, city, finally, fell, in, 1337, despite, these, setbacks, andronikos, iii, was, able, to, score, a, few, successes, against, his, opponents, in, greece, and, asia, minor, epirus, along, with, thessaly, were, retaken, in, 1329, the, byzantines, recaptured, chios, and, in, 1335, secured, lesbos, nonetheless, these, isolated, islands, were, isolated, exceptions, to, the, general, trend, of, increasing, ottoman, conquests, furthermore, none, of, the, islands, were, a, part, of, the, ottoman, domain, their, capture, demonstrates, the, potential, that, the, byzantines, had, at, the, time, of, andronikos, iii, byzantine, military, ability, would, be, further, weakened, by, serbian, expansions, into, recent, acquisitions, by, andronikos, iii, epirus, and, finally, by, a, devastating, civil, war, that, would, subjugate, the, byzantine, empire, as, a, vassal, to, the, ottomans, andronikos, iii, died, in, 1341, leaving, his, 10, year, old, son, john, v, to, rule, a, regency, was, set, up, with, john, cantacuzenus, the, young, emperor, s, mother, anna, of, savoy, and, the, patriarch, john, xiv, kalekas, rivalries, between, kalekas, and, cantacuzenus, led, to, a, destructive, civil, war, in, which, cantacuzenus, emerged, triumphant, at, constantinople, in, february, 1347, during, this, time, plague, earthquakes, and, ottoman, raiding, continued, until, only, philadelphia, remained, in, byzantine, hands, and, only, so, by, payment, of, a, tribute, throughout, the, civil, war, the, byzantines, on, both, sides, employed, turks, and, serbs, with, mercenaries, pillaging, at, will, leaving, much, of, macedonia, in, ruin, and, in, the, hands, of, the, newly, created, serbian, empire, following, this, victory, cantacuzenus, ruled, as, co, emperor, with, john, v, this, dual, rule, eventually, failed, and, the, two, waged, a, new, civil, war, further, diminishing, what, was, left, of, byzantium, s, integrity, in, the, eyes, of, her, troublesome, neighbors, john, vi, cantacuzenus, emerged, triumphant, once, again, and, replaced, the, now, exiled, john, v, palaiologos, with, his, son, matthew, cantacuzenus, as, junior, co, emperor, however, the, turks, under, osman, i, s, son, orhan, i, now, came, into, play, by, capturing, the, fort, of, kallipolis, gallipoli, in, 1354, and, gaining, access, to, the, european, mainland, the, arrival, of, the, seemingly, unbeatable, ottoman, soldiers, surrounding, constantinople, caused, a, panic, in, constantinople, capitalized, by, john, v, who, with, the, assistance, of, the, genoese, staged, a, coup, and, ousted, john, vi, cantacuzenus, in, november, 1354, as, a, result, john, vi, would, later, become, a, monk, the, civil, war, did, not, end, there, matthew, cantacuzenus, now, obtained, troops, from, orhan, and, began, a, bid, for, taking, constantinople, his, capture, in, 1356, ended, his, dreams, of, becoming, emperor, and, with, it, came, an, ephemeral, defeat, for, the, ottomans, who, had, favored, the, overthrow, of, john, v, following, the, end, of, the, civil, conflict, came, a, small, lull, in, fighting, between, the, expanding, ottomans, and, byzantines, in, 1361, didymoteichon, fell, to, the, turks, orhan, s, successor, murad, i, was, more, concerned, with, his, anatolian, positions, however, just, like, alp, arslan, of, the, seljuk, turks, murad, i, left, the, taking, of, byzantine, territory, to, his, vassals, with, philippopolis, falling, after, major, campaigning, between, 1363, 64, and, adrianople, succumbing, to, the, ottomans, in, 1369, the, byzantine, empire, was, in, no, position, to, launch, any, decent, counter, attack, or, defense, of, these, lands, by, now, the, ottomans, had, become, supremely, powerful, murad, i, crushed, an, army, of, serbians, on, 26, september, 1371, at, the, battle, of, maritsa, leading, to, the, end, of, serbian, power, the, ottomans, were, now, poised, to, conquer, constantinople, in, an, attempt, to, stave, off, defeat, john, v, appealed, to, the, pope, for, support, offering, submission, to, rome, in, return, for, military, support, despite, publicly, confessing, the, roman, catholic, faith, in, st, peter, s, basilica, john, v, received, no, help, john, v, therefore, was, forced, to, turn, to, reason, with, his, enemies, the, ottomans, murad, i, and, john, v, then, came, to, an, agreement, whereby, byzantium, would, provide, regular, tribute, in, troops, and, money, in, exchange, for, security, by, now, the, ottomans, had, essentially, won, the, war, byzantium, was, reduced, to, a, few, settlements, other, than, constantinople, and, was, forced, to, recognize, its, vassal, status, to, the, ottoman, sultan, this, vassalage, continued, until, 1394, however, whilst, constantinople, had, been, neutralized, the, surrounding, christian, powers, were, still, a, threat, to, the, ottomans, and, asia, minor, was, not, under, complete, ottoman, control, the, ottomans, continued, their, thrust, into, the, balkans, proving, to, be, great, conquerors, in, europe, as, they, were, in, anatolia, in, 1385, sofia, was, captured, from, the, bulgarians, and, ni, was, taken, the, following, year, meanwhile, various, smaller, states, were, subjugated, as, vassals, including, the, serbs, following, the, battle, of, kosovo, in, 1389, much, of, bulgaria, was, taken, in, 1393, by, bayezid, i, by, 1396, the, bulgarians, had, been, entirely, subjugated, when, vidin, fell, ottoman, advances, into, the, balkans, were, aided, by, further, byzantine, civil, conflict, this, time, between, john, v, and, his, eldest, son, andronikos, iv, with, ottoman, aid, from, murad, i, john, v, was, able, to, blind, andronikos, iv, and, his, son, john, vii, palaiologos, in, september, 1373, andronikos, escaped, with, his, son, and, secured, murad, s, aid, by, promising, a, higher, tribute, than, john, v, s, the, civil, strife, continued, as, late, as, september, 1390, though, potential, for, conflict, continued, until, 1408, john, v, eventually, forgave, andronikos, iv, and, his, son, in, 1381, angering, his, second, son, and, heir, apparent, manuel, ii, palaiologos, he, seized, thessalonika, alarming, the, ottoman, sultan, in, liberating, parts, of, greece, from, ottoman, rule, the, death, of, andronikos, iv, in, 1385, and, the, capitulation, of, thessalonika, in, 1387, to, hayreddin, pasha, encouraged, manuel, ii, palaiologos, to, seek, the, forgiveness, of, the, sultan, and, john, v, his, increasingly, close, relationship, with, john, v, angered, john, vii, who, saw, his, right, as, the, heir, threatened, john, vii, launched, a, coup, against, john, v, but, despite, ottoman, and, genoese, aid, his, reign, lasted, mere, five, months, before, he, was, toppled, by, manuel, ii, and, his, father, in, the, year, 1390, bayazid, i, sent, a, fleet, to, burn, down, chios, and, the, surrounding, market, towns, euboea, parts, of, attica, and, the, islands, of, the, archipelago, he, destroyed, every, market, town, and, village, from, bithynia, to, thrace, on, the, outskirts, of, constantinople, and, deported, all, the, inhabitants, whilst, the, civil, war, was, raging, the, turks, in, anatolia, took, the, opportunity, to, seize, philadelphia, in, 1390, marking, the, end, of, byzantine, rule, in, anatolia, although, by, now, the, city, had, long, been, under, only, nominal, imperial, rule, and, its, fall, was, of, little, strategic, consequence, to, the, byzantines, following, john, v, s, death, manuel, ii, palaiologos, was, able, to, secure, his, throne, and, establish, good, relations, with, the, sultan, becoming, his, tributary, in, return, for, ottoman, acceptance, of, his, reign, manuel, ii, was, forced, to, dismantle, the, fortifications, at, the, golden, gate, something, that, he, did, not, take, lightly, to, in, 1394, relations, between, the, byzantines, and, the, ottomans, changed, for, the, worse, and, the, war, between, the, two, resumed, when, the, ottoman, sultan, bayezid, ruled, 1389, 1402, ordered, the, execution, of, manuel, ii, after, the, emperor, attempted, to, reconcile, with, his, nephew, john, vii, the, ottoman, sultan, then, later, changed, his, decision, and, demanded, that, a, mosque, and, a, turkish, colony, be, established, in, constantinople, manuel, ii, not, only, refused, this, he, also, refused, to, pay, the, sultan, tribute, and, went, so, far, as, to, ignore, the, sultan, s, messages, leading, to, a, siege, of, the, city, in, 1394, manuel, ii, called, for, a, crusade, which, came, in, 1396, under, the, future, holy, roman, emperor, sigismund, the, crusade, was, routed, at, nicopolis, in, 1396, the, defeat, convinced, manuel, ii, to, escape, the, city, and, travel, to, western, europe, for, aid, during, this, time, the, reconciled, john, vii, led, the, city, s, successful, defense, against, the, ottomans, the, siege, was, finally, broken, when, timur, of, the, chagatai, mongols, led, an, army, into, anatolia, dismantling, the, network, of, beyliks, loyal, to, the, ottoman, sultan, at, the, battle, of, ankara, timur, s, forces, routed, bayezid, i, s, forces, a, shocking, defeat, for, which, no, one, was, prepared, in, the, aftermath, the, ottoman, turks, began, fighting, each, other, led, by, bayezid, s, sons, the, byzantines, wasted, no, time, exploiting, the, situation, and, signed, a, peace, treaty, with, their, christian, neighbours, and, with, one, of, bayezid, s, sons, by, signing, the, treaty, they, were, able, to, recover, thessalonika, and, much, of, the, peloponnese, the, ottoman, civil, war, ended, in, 1413, when, mehmed, i, with, the, support, of, the, byzantine, empire, defeated, his, opponents, the, rare, amity, established, between, the, two, states, would, not, last, the, death, of, mehmed, i, and, the, rise, of, murad, ii, in, 1421, coupled, with, the, ascent, of, john, viii, to, the, byzantine, throne, led, to, a, deteriorated, change, in, relations, between, the, two, neither, leader, was, content, with, the, status, quo, john, viii, made, the, first, and, foolish, move, by, inciting, a, rebellion, in, the, ottoman, empire, a, certain, mustafa, had, been, released, by, the, byzantines, and, claimed, that, he, was, bayezid, s, lost, son, despite, the, odds, a, sizable, force, had, mustered, in, europe, under, his, banner, defeating, murad, ii, s, subordinates, murad, ii, s, furious, reply, eventually, smashed, this, upstart, and, in, 1422, began, the, siege, of, thessalonika, and, constantinople, john, viii, then, turned, to, his, aging, father, manuel, ii, for, advice, the, result, was, that, he, incited, yet, another, rebellion, in, the, ottoman, ranks, this, time, supporting, murad, ii, brother, s, claim, kucuk, mustafa, the, seemingly, promising, rebellion, had, its, origins, in, asia, minor, with, bursa, coming, under, siege, after, a, failed, assault, on, constantinople, murad, ii, was, forced, to, turn, back, his, army, and, defeat, kucuk, with, these, defeats, the, byzantines, were, forced, once, more, into, vassalage, 300, 000, coins, of, silver, were, to, be, delivered, to, the, sultan, as, tribute, on, an, annual, basis, the, ottomans, faced, numerous, opponents, between, 1424, and, 1453, tied, down, by, the, siege, of, thessalonika, the, ottomans, had, to, contend, with, the, serbs, under, george, brankovic, the, hungarians, under, john, hunyadi, and, the, albanians, under, george, kastrioti, skanderbeg, this, resistance, culminated, into, the, crusade, of, varna, of, 1444, which, despite, much, local, support, and, deception, a, peace, treaty, was, unilaterally, revoked, by, the, hungarians, was, defeated, in, 1448, and, 1451, there, was, a, change, in, the, byzantine, and, ottoman, leaderships, respectively, murad, ii, died, and, was, succeeded, by, mehmed, ii, the, conqueror, whilst, constantine, xi, palaiologos, succeeded, john, viii, constantine, xi, and, mehmed, did, not, get, along, well, the, former, s, successful, conquests, of, crusader, territory, in, the, peloponnese, alarmed, the, latter, who, had, since, subjugated, the, crusaders, in, the, region, as, vassals, thus, mehmed, had, around, 40, 000, soldiers, sent, to, nullify, these, gains, constantine, xi, threatened, to, rebel, against, mehmed, unless, certain, conditions, were, met, by, the, sultan, regarding, the, status, quo, mehmed, responded, to, these, threats, by, building, fortifications, in, the, bosporus, and, thus, closed, constantinople, from, outside, naval, assistance, the, ottomans, already, controlled, the, land, around, constantinople, and, so, they, began, an, assault, on, the, city, on, 6, april, 1453, despite, a, union, of, the, catholic, and, orthodox, churches, the, byzantines, received, no, official, aid, from, the, pope, or, western, europe, with, the, exception, of, a, few, soldiers, from, venice, and, genoa, england, and, france, were, in, the, concluding, stages, of, the, hundred, years, war, the, french, did, not, wish, to, lose, their, advantage, in, the, fight, by, sending, knights, and, the, english, were, in, no, position, to, do, so, spain, was, in, the, final, stages, of, the, reconquista, the, holy, roman, empire, never, centralized, enough, behind, the, hohenstaufen, to, unite, the, principalities, had, exhausted, what, could, be, spared, at, varna, further, fighting, among, the, german, princes, and, the, hussite, wars, seriously, reduced, the, willingness, of, most, to, perform, a, crusade, poland, and, hungary, were, key, participants, at, varna, and, the, defeat, there, along, with, the, polish, teutonic, wars, kept, them, busy, and, unwilling, for, further, commitments, other, than, these, major, european, powers, the, only, others, were, the, italian, city, states, genoa, and, venice, were, both, enemies, of, the, ottomans, but, also, of, each, other, the, venetians, considered, sending, their, fleet, up, to, attack, the, fortifications, guarding, the, dardanelles, and, the, bosporus, thereby, relieving, the, city, but, the, force, was, too, small, and, arrived, too, late, the, ottomans, would, have, overpowered, any, military, assistance, provided, by, one, city, even, one, as, large, and, powerful, as, the, venetian, republic, in, any, case, some, 2, 000, mercenaries, mostly, italian, under, giovanni, giustiniani, longo, arrived, to, assist, in, the, defense, of, the, city, the, city, s, entire, defense, fell, to, these, mercenaries, and, 5, 000, militia, soldiers, raised, from, a, city, whose, population, had, been, seriously, eroded, by, heavy, taxation, plague, and, civil, conflict, though, poorly, trained, the, defenders, were, well, armed, with, many, weapons, except, for, any, cannons, to, match, the, ottoman, s, own, artillery, the, city, s, fall, was, not, a, result, of, the, ottoman, artillery, nor, their, naval, supremacy, many, italian, ships, were, able, to, aid, and, then, escape, the, city, the, fall, of, constantinople, came, about, due, to, the, combined, weight, of, overwhelming, odds, stacked, against, the, city, outnumbered, by, more, than, ten, to, one, the, defenders, were, overcome, by, sheer, attrition, as, well, as, the, skill, of, the, ottoman, janissaries, as, the, ottomans, continued, their, seemingly, unsuccessful, and, costly, assaults, many, in, their, camp, began, to, doubt, the, success, of, the, siege, history, had, shown, the, city, to, be, invincible, to, ottoman, siege, in, an, effort, to, raise, morale, the, sultan, then, made, a, speech, reminding, his, troops, of, the, vast, wealth, and, pillaging, of, the, city, to, come, an, all, out, assault, captured, the, city, on, may, 29, 1453, as, the, ottomans, fanned, out, to, sack, the, city, their, naval, discipline, began, to, collapse, and, many, genoans, and, venetians, escaped, in, vessels, from, the, city, including, niccol, barbaro, a, venetian, surgeon, present, at, the, siege, who, wrote, all, through, the, day, the, turks, made, a, great, slaughter, of, christians, through, the, city, the, blood, flowed, in, the, city, like, rainwater, after, a, sudden, storm, and, the, corpses, of, turks, and, christians, were, thrown, into, the, dardanelles, where, they, floated, out, to, sea, like, melons, along, a, canal, after, the, siege, the, ottomans, went, on, to, take, morea, in, 1460, and, trebizond, in, 1461, with, the, fall, of, trebizond, came, the, end, of, the, roman, empire, the, palaiologoi, continued, to, be, recognized, as, the, rightful, emperors, of, constantinople, by, the, crowned, heads, of, europe, until, the, 16th, century, when, the, reformation, the, ottoman, threat, to, europe, and, decreased, interest, in, crusading, forced, european, powers, to, recognize, the, ottoman, empire, as, masters, of, anatolia, and, the, levant, byzantine, rule, in, its, former, sphere, ended, fully, following, the, conquests, of, several, major, rump, states, the, fall, of, trebizond, in, 1461, theodoro, in, 1475, and, epirus, then, under, the, tocco, family, in, 1479, the, latin, presence, in, the, balkans, seriously, undermined, the, byzantines, ability, to, coordinate, their, efforts, against, the, ottoman, turks, this, is, exemplified, by, michael, viii, palaiologos, whose, attempts, to, drive, the, latins, out, of, greece, led, to, the, abandonment, of, the, anatolian, borders, which, allowed, several, beyliks, as, well, as, the, turks, of, osman, i, to, raid, and, settle, former, byzantine, lands, andronikos, ii, s, campaigns, in, anatolia, though, it, obtained, some, military, success, was, constantly, thwarted, by, events, in, the, west, of, the, empire, in, any, event, the, byzantines, were, forced, to, choose, between, papal, and, latin, threat, of, attack, or, an, unpopular, union, which, was, exploited, by, numerous, rival, claimants, as, cause, for, a, coup, against, the, byzantine, emperor, nonetheless, towards, the, mid, and, late, 14th, century, the, byzantines, began, to, receive, nominal, aid, from, the, west, this, was, little, more, than, sympathy, toward, a, fellow, christian, power, fighting, a, muslim, power, and, despite, two, crusades, the, byzantines, received, as, much, help, from, rome, as, we, did, from, the, sultan, the, mamluk, sultanate, in, the, 13th, century, had, been, one, of, the, most, determined, powers, to, remove, christian, influence, in, the, middle, east, and, raiding, by, cyprus, did, not, change, this, in, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, following, the, fourth, crusade, the, byzantines, were, left, in, an, unstable, position, the, capture, of, constantinople, in, 1261, and, subsequent, campaigning, did, not, come, at, a, good, time, the, weakening, of, the, sultanate, of, rum, resulted, in, many, beyliks, breaking, away, as, autonomous, states, such, as, the, upstart, beylik, founded, by, osman, i, this, weakening, of, unified, turkish, power, gave, the, empire, of, nicaea, a, temporary, upper, hand, in, in, order, to, implement, these, greek, re, conquests, michael, viii, was, forced, to, levy, crushing, taxes, on, the, anatolian, peasantry, in, order, to, pay, for, the, expensive, army, that, modeled, around, the, komnenian, army, this, led, to, much, peasant, support, for, the, turks, whose, system, resulted, in, fewer, taxes, initially, after, michael, viii, s, death, the, byzantines, suffered, from, constant, civil, strife, early, on, the, ottomans, suffered, civil, conflict, as, well, but, this, occurred, much, later, on, in, the, 15th, century, by, that, time, the, byzantines, were, too, weak, to, reconquer, much, territory, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, civil, strife, of, byzantium, occurring, at, a, time, 1341, 1371, when, the, ottomans, were, crossing, into, europe, through, a, devastated, gallipoli, and, surrounding, the, city, thus, sealing, its, fate, as, a, vassal, when, attempts, were, made, to, break, this, vassalage, the, byzantines, found, themselves, out, matched, and, at, the, mercy, of, latin, assistance, which, despite, two, crusades, ultimately, amounted, to, nothing, ottoman, rule, was, auspicious, to, the, anatolian, commoner, due, to, the, aforementioned, byzantine, taxes, thus, they, were, able, to, levy, vast, numbers, of, willing, troops, initially, their, raiding, gave, them, great, support, from, other, turks, near, osman, s, small, domain, in, time, however, as, the, turks, began, to, settle, in, land, formerly, held, by, the, overextended, byzantines, they, were, able, to, exploit, the, hardships, of, the, peasant, classes, by, recruiting, their, aid, those, that, did, not, assist, the, ottomans, were, raided, themselves, eventually, the, cities, in, asia, minor, isolated, from, the, much, more, administrated, cities, of, the, western, half, of, the, byzantine, empire, surrendered, during, their, conquests, the, ottomans, were, able, to, acquire, a, thorough, grasp, on, the, art, of, siege, warfare, due, to, a, majority, of, those, cities, being, walled, it, was, the, ottoman, s, laissez, faire, method, of, administrating, new, conquests, that, allowed, them, to, expand, so, quickly, as, opposed, to, the, heavily, centralized, byzantine, method, of, governance, the, ottomans, would, subjugate, their, opponents, as, vassals, rather, than, destroy, them, otherwise, they, would, have, exhausted, themselves, in, the, process, the, exacting, of, tribute, from, conquered, states, in, the, form, of, children, and, money, was, effective, in, forcing, subjugation, over, conquest, coupled, with, this, the, entire, region, was, composed, of, disparate, states, bulgaria, serbia, latin, states, who, would, just, as, soon, fight, each, other, as, the, ottomans, and, realized, too, late, that, the, ottoman, forces, defeated, them, by, integrating, them, in, a, network, of, subordinate, states, the, fall, of, constantinople, came, as, a, shock, to, the, papacy, which, ordered, an, immediate, counter, attack, in, the, form, of, a, crusade, only, philip, the, good, duke, of, burgundy, responded, but, under, the, condition, that, a, powerful, monarch, assist, him, however, none, would, do, so, pope, pius, ii, then, ordered, another, crusade, again, no, substantial, efforts, were, seen, by, any, of, europe, s, major, leaders, of, the, time, this, forced, the, pope, himself, to, lead, a, crusade, his, death, in, 1464, led, to, the, disbanding, of, the, crusade, at, the, port, of, ancona, the, fall, also, had, many, implications, in, europe, the, influx, of, greek, science, and, culture, into, europe, by, those, escaping, the, ottomans, was, a, crucial, factor, in, catalyzing, the, european, renaissance, the, failed, attempts, at, defeating, the, ottomans, at, nicopolis, and, varna, the, loss, of, the, holy, land, without, byzantium, the, crusades, could, not, re, supply, en, route, and, the, lack, of, a, genuine, counter, attack, led, many, including, martin, luther, into, believing, that, the, turks, were, god, s, punishment, against, the, sins, of, christians, how, shamefully, the, pope, has, this, long, time, baited, us, with, the, war, against, the, turks, taken, our, money, destroyed, so, many, christians, and, made, so, much, mischief, nonetheless, by, 1529, europe, began, to, rise, to, the, threat, of, the, ottomans, martin, luther, changing, his, views, wrote, that, the, scourge, of, god, had, to, be, fought, with, great, vigour, by, secular, leaders, rather, than, as, crusades, initiated, by, the, papacy, with, the, ottomans, hold, on, constantinople, de, facto, recognized, by, europe, s, lack, of, action, the, ottomans, went, on, to, facilitate, further, conquests, in, europe, and, in, the, middle, east, their, power, finally, reached, a, peak, in, the, mid, 17th, century, their, success, through, the, janissaries, became, their, new, weakness, due, to, their, conservativism, and, power, ottoman, reform, was, difficult, to, implement, whilst, european, armies, became, increasingly, more, resourceful, and, modernized, as, a, result, russian, and, austrian, attempts, to, contain, the, ottoman, threat, became, more, and, more, a, formality, until, the, official, dissolution, of, the, empire, after, world, war, i
