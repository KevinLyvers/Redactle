chaldea, k, l, d, i, was, a, small, country, that, existed, between, the, late, 10th, or, early, 9th, and, mid, 6th, centuries, bc, after, which, the, country, and, its, people, were, absorbed, and, assimilated, into, the, indigenous, population, of, babylonia, semitic, speaking, it, was, located, in, the, marshy, land, of, the, far, southeastern, corner, of, mesopotamia, and, briefly, came, to, rule, babylon, the, hebrew, bible, uses, the, term, ka, dim, and, this, is, translated, as, chaldaeans, in, the, greek, old, testament, although, there, is, some, dispute, as, to, whether, kasdim, in, fact, means, chaldean, or, refers, to, the, south, mesopotamian, kaldu, during, a, period, of, weakness, in, the, east, semitic, speaking, kingdom, of, babylonia, new, tribes, of, west, semitic, speaking, migrants, arrived, in, the, region, from, the, levant, between, the, 11th, and, 9th, centuries, bc, the, earliest, waves, consisted, of, suteans, and, arameans, followed, a, century, or, so, later, by, the, kaldu, a, group, who, became, known, later, as, the, chaldeans, or, the, chaldees, these, migrations, did, not, affect, the, powerful, kingdom, and, empire, of, assyria, in, upper, mesopotamia, which, repelled, these, incursions, these, nomadic, chaldeans, settled, in, the, far, southeastern, portion, of, babylonia, chiefly, on, the, left, bank, of, the, euphrates, though, for, a, short, time, the, name, commonly, referred, to, the, whole, of, southern, mesopotamia, in, hebraic, literature, this, was, a, geographical, and, historical, misnomer, as, chaldea, proper, was, in, fact, only, the, plain, in, the, far, southeast, formed, by, the, deposits, of, the, euphrates, and, the, tigris, extending, about, 640, kilometres, 400, mi, along, the, course, of, these, rivers, and, averaging, about, 160, km, 100, mi, in, width, there, were, several, kings, of, chaldean, origins, who, ruled, babylonia, 178, from, 626, bc, to, 539, bc, a, ruling, family, referred, to, as, the, chaldean, dynasty, named, after, their, possible, chaldean, origin, 4, ruled, the, kingdom, at, its, height, under, the, neo, babylonian, empire, although, the, final, ruler, of, this, empire, nabonidus, 556, 539, bc, and, his, son, and, regent, belshazzar, was, a, usurper, of, assyrian, ancestry, the, name, chaldaea, is, a, latinization, of, the, greek, khalda, a, a, hellenization, of, akkadian, m, t, kaldu, or, ka, du, suggesting, an, underlying, ka, du, the, name, appears, in, hebrew, in, the, bible, as, ka, dim, and, in, aramaic, as, ka, d, y, the, bible, book, of, genesis, 22, 22, uses, the, name, kesed, ancient, pronunciation, ka, d, the, singular, form, of, kasdim, meaning, chaldeans, kesed, is, identified, as, son, of, abraham, s, brother, nahor, and, brother, of, kemuel, the, father, of, aram, residing, in, aram, naharaim, jewish, historian, flavius, josephus, 37, c, 100, also, links, arphaxad, and, chaldaea, in, his, antiquities, of, the, jews, arphaxad, named, the, arphaxadites, who, are, now, called, chaldeans, in, the, early, period, between, the, early, 9th, century, and, late, 7th, century, bc, mat, kaldi, was, the, name, of, a, small, sporadically, independent, migrant, founded, territory, under, the, domination, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, 911, 605, bc, in, southeastern, babylonia, extending, to, the, western, shores, of, the, persian, gulf, the, expression, mat, bit, y, kin, is, also, used, apparently, synonymously, bit, y, kin, was, the, name, of, the, largest, and, most, powerful, of, the, five, tribes, of, the, chaldeans, or, equivalently, their, territory, the, original, extension, of, bit, y, kin, is, not, known, precisely, but, it, extended, from, the, lower, tigris, into, the, arabian, peninsula, sargon, ii, mentions, it, as, extending, as, far, as, dilmun, or, sea, land, littoral, eastern, arabia, chaldea, or, mat, kaldi, generally, referred, to, the, low, marshy, alluvial, land, around, the, estuaries, of, the, tigris, and, euphrates, which, at, the, time, discharged, their, waters, through, separate, mouths, into, the, sea, the, tribal, capital, dur, y, kin, was, the, original, seat, of, marduk, baladan, the, king, of, chaldea, was, also, called, the, king, of, bit, yakin, just, as, the, kings, of, babylonia, and, assyria, were, regularly, styled, simply, king, of, babylon, or, assur, the, capital, city, in, each, case, in, the, same, way, what, is, now, known, as, the, persian, gulf, was, sometimes, called, the, sea, of, bit, yakin, and, sometimes, the, sea, of, the, land, of, chaldea, chaldea, came, to, be, used, in, a, wider, sense, of, southern, mesopotamia, in, general, following, the, brief, ascendancy, of, the, chaldeans, during, 608, 557, bc, this, is, especially, the, case, in, the, hebrew, bible, which, was, substantially, composed, during, this, period, roughly, corresponding, to, the, period, of, babylonian, captivity, the, book, of, jeremiah, makes, frequent, reference, to, the, chaldeans, king, james, version, chaldees, following, lxx, in, biblical, hebrew, as, kasd, m, book, of, habakkuk, 1, 6, calls, them, that, bitter, and, hasty, nation, book, of, isaiah, 23, 13, drb, states, behold, the, land, of, the, chaldeans, there, was, not, such, a, people, the, assyrians, founded, it, they, have, led, away, the, strong, ones, thereof, into, captivity, they, have, destroyed, the, houses, thereof, they, have, brought, it, to, ruin, unlike, the, east, semitic, akkadian, speaking, akkadians, assyrians, and, babylonians, whose, ancestors, had, been, established, in, mesopotamia, since, at, least, the, 30th, century, bc, the, chaldeans, were, not, a, native, mesopotamian, people, but, were, late, 10th, or, early, 9th, century, bc, west, semitic, levantine, migrants, to, the, southeastern, corner, of, the, region, who, had, played, no, part, in, the, previous, three, millennia, of, sumero, akkadian, and, assyro, babylonian, mesopotamian, civilization, and, history, the, ancient, chaldeans, seem, to, have, migrated, into, mesopotamia, sometime, between, c, 940, and, 860, bc, a, century, or, so, after, other, new, semitic, arrivals, the, arameans, and, the, suteans, appeared, in, babylonia, c, 1100, bc, according, to, ran, zadok, they, first, appear, in, written, record, in, cylinder, inscriptions, of, the, king, of, mari, a, ur, ketta, l, ir, ii, late, 12th, early, 11th, century, bc, which, record, them, reaching, messopotamia, as, early, as, the, 11th, century, bc, they, later, appear, in, the, annals, of, the, assyrian, king, shalmaneser, iii, during, the, 850s, bc, this, was, a, period, of, weakness, in, babylonia, and, its, ineffectual, native, kings, were, unable, to, prevent, new, waves, of, semi, nomadic, foreign, peoples, from, invading, and, settling, in, the, land, though, belonging, to, the, same, west, semitic, speaking, ethnic, group, and, migrating, from, the, same, levantine, regions, as, the, earlier, arriving, aramaeans, they, are, to, be, differentiated, the, assyrian, king, sennacherib, for, example, carefully, distinguishes, them, in, his, inscriptions, the, chaldeans, were, for, a, time, able, to, keep, their, identity, despite, the, dominant, native, assyro, babylonian, sumero, akkadian, derived, culture, although, as, was, the, case, for, the, earlier, amorites, kassites, and, suteans, before, them, by, the, time, babylon, fell, in, 539, bc, perhaps, before, the, chaldeans, ceased, to, exist, as, a, specific, ethnic, group, in, the, hebrew, bible, ur, of, the, chaldees, ur, ka, dim, is, cited, as, the, starting, point, of, the, patriarch, abraham, s, journey, to, canaan, ancient, chaldeans, originally, spoke, a, west, semitic, language, similar, to, old, aramaic, during, the, neo, assyrian, empire, imperial, aramaic, became, the, lingua, franca, of, the, empire, under, the, rule, of, the, assyrian, king, tiglath, pileser, iii, in, the, mid, 8th, century, bc, as, a, result, in, late, periods, both, the, babylonian, and, assyrian, dialects, of, akkadian, became, marginalized, and, aramaic, took, its, place, across, mesopotamia, including, among, the, chaldeans, and, later, also, the, southern, levant, one, form, of, this, once, widespread, aramaic, language, was, used, in, some, books, of, the, hebrew, bible, the, book, of, daniel, and, the, book, of, ezra, the, use, of, the, name, chaldean, chaldaic, chaldee, to, describe, it, first, introduced, by, jerome, of, stridon, d, 420, became, common, in, early, aramaic, studies, but, that, misnomer, was, later, corrected, when, modern, scholars, concluded, that, the, aramaic, dialect, used, in, the, hebrew, bible, was, not, related, to, the, ancient, chaldeans, and, their, language, ancient, chaldeans, believed, in, three, heavens, the, region, that, the, chaldeans, eventually, made, their, homeland, was, in, relatively, poor, southeastern, mesopotamia, at, the, head, of, the, persian, gulf, they, appear, to, have, migrated, into, southern, babylonia, from, the, levant, at, some, unknown, point, between, the, end, of, the, reign, of, ninurta, kudurri, usur, ii, a, contemporary, of, tiglath, pileser, ii, circa, 940, bc, and, the, start, of, the, reign, of, marduk, zakir, shumi, i, in, 855, bc, although, there, is, no, historical, proof, of, their, existence, prior, to, the, late, 850s, bc, for, perhaps, a, century, or, so, after, settling, in, the, area, these, semi, nomadic, migrant, chaldean, tribes, had, no, impact, on, the, pages, of, history, seemingly, remaining, subjugated, by, the, native, akkadian, speaking, kings, of, babylon, or, by, perhaps, regionally, influential, aramean, tribes, the, main, players, in, southern, mesopotamia, during, this, period, were, babylonia, and, assyria, together, with, elam, to, the, east, and, the, aramaeans, who, had, already, settled, in, the, region, a, century, or, so, prior, to, the, arrival, of, the, chaldeans, the, very, first, written, historical, attestation, of, the, existence, of, chaldeans, occurs, in, 852, bc, in, the, annals, of, the, assyrian, king, shalmaneser, iii, who, mentions, invading, the, southeastern, extremes, of, babylonia, and, subjugating, one, mushallim, marduk, the, chief, of, the, amukani, tribe, and, overall, leader, of, the, kaldu, tribes, together, with, capturing, the, town, of, baqani, extracting, tribute, from, adini, chief, of, the, bet, dakkuri, another, chaldean, tribe, shalmaneser, iii, had, invaded, babylonia, at, the, request, of, its, own, king, marduk, zakir, shumi, i, who, being, threatened, by, his, own, rebellious, relations, together, with, powerful, aramean, tribes, pleaded, with, the, more, powerful, assyrian, king, for, help, the, subjugation, of, the, chaldean, tribes, by, the, assyrian, king, appears, to, have, been, an, aside, as, they, were, not, at, that, time, a, powerful, force, or, a, threat, to, the, native, babylonian, king, important, kaldu, tribes, and, their, regions, in, southeastern, babylonia, were, bit, y, kin, the, original, area, the, chaldeans, settled, in, on, the, persian, gulf, bet, dakuri, bet, adini, bet, amukkani, and, bet, shilani, chaldean, leaders, had, by, this, time, already, adopted, assyro, babylonian, names, religion, language, and, customs, indicating, that, they, had, become, akkadianized, to, a, great, degree, the, chaldeans, remained, quietly, ruled, by, the, native, babylonians, who, were, in, turn, subjugated, by, their, assyrian, relations, for, the, next, seventy, two, years, only, coming, to, historical, prominence, for, the, first, time, in, babylonia, in, 780, bc, when, a, previously, unknown, chaldean, named, marduk, apla, usur, usurped, the, throne, from, the, native, babylonian, king, marduk, bel, zeri, 790, 780, bc, the, latter, was, a, vassal, of, the, assyrian, king, shalmaneser, iv, 783, 773, bc, who, was, otherwise, occupied, quelling, a, civil, war, in, assyria, at, the, time, this, was, to, set, a, precedent, for, all, future, chaldean, aspirations, on, babylon, during, the, neo, assyrian, empire, always, too, weak, to, confront, a, strong, assyria, alone, and, directly, the, chaldeans, awaited, periods, when, assyrian, kings, were, distracted, elsewhere, in, their, vast, empire, or, engaged, in, internal, conflicts, then, in, alliance, with, other, powers, stronger, than, themselves, usually, elam, they, made, a, bid, for, control, over, babylonia, shalmaneser, iv, attacked, and, defeated, marduk, apla, user, retaking, northern, babylonia, and, forcing, on, him, a, border, treaty, in, assyria, s, favour, the, assyrians, allowed, him, to, remain, on, the, throne, although, subject, to, assyria, eriba, marduk, another, chaldean, succeeded, him, in, 769, bc, and, his, son, nabu, shuma, ishkun, in, 761, bc, with, both, being, dominated, by, the, new, assyrian, king, ashur, dan, iii, 772, 755, bc, babylonia, appears, to, have, been, in, a, state, of, chaos, during, this, time, with, the, north, occupied, by, assyria, its, throne, occupied, by, foreign, chaldeans, and, continual, civil, unrest, throughout, the, land, the, chaldean, rule, proved, short, lived, a, native, babylonian, king, named, nabonassar, 748, 734, bc, defeated, and, overthrew, the, chaldean, usurpers, in, 748, bc, restored, indigenous, rule, and, successfully, stabilised, babylonia, the, chaldeans, once, more, faded, into, obscurity, for, the, next, three, decades, during, this, time, both, the, babylonians, and, the, chaldean, and, aramean, migrant, groups, who, had, settled, in, the, land, once, more, fell, completely, under, the, yoke, of, the, powerful, assyrian, king, tiglath, pileser, iii, 745, 727, bc, a, ruler, who, introduced, imperial, aramaic, as, the, lingua, franca, of, the, empire, the, assyrian, king, at, first, made, nabonassar, and, his, successor, native, babylonian, kings, nabu, nadin, zeri, nabu, suma, ukin, ii, and, nabu, mukin, zeri, his, subjects, but, decided, to, rule, babylonia, directly, from, 729, bc, he, was, followed, by, shalmaneser, v, 727, 722, bc, who, also, ruled, babylon, in, person, when, sargon, ii, 722, 705, bc, ascended, the, throne, of, the, assyrian, empire, in, 722, bc, after, the, death, of, shalmaneser, v, he, was, forced, to, launch, a, major, campaign, in, his, subject, states, of, persia, mannea, and, media, in, ancient, iran, to, defend, his, territories, there, he, defeated, and, drove, out, the, scythians, and, cimmerians, who, had, attacked, assyria, s, persian, and, median, vassal, colonies, in, the, region, at, the, same, time, egypt, began, encouraging, and, supporting, the, rebellion, against, assyria, in, israel, and, canaan, forcing, the, assyrians, to, send, troops, to, deal, with, the, egyptians, these, events, allowed, the, chaldeans, to, once, more, attempt, to, assert, themselves, while, the, assyrian, king, was, otherwise, occupied, defending, his, iranian, colonies, from, the, scythians, and, cimmerians, and, driving, the, egyptians, from, canaan, marduk, apla, iddina, ii, the, biblical, merodach, baladan, of, bit, y, kin, allied, himself, with, the, powerful, elamite, kingdom, and, the, native, babylonians, briefly, seizing, control, of, babylon, between, 721, and, 710, bc, with, the, scythians, and, cimmerians, vanquished, the, medes, and, persians, pledging, loyalty, and, the, egyptians, defeated, and, ejected, from, southern, canaan, sargon, ii, was, free, at, last, to, deal, with, the, chaldeans, babylonians, and, elamites, he, attacked, and, deposed, marduk, apla, adding, ii, in, 710, bc, also, defeating, his, elamite, allies, in, the, process, after, defeat, by, the, assyrians, merodach, baladan, fled, to, his, protectors, in, elam, in, 703, merodach, baladan, very, briefly, regained, the, throne, from, a, native, akkadian, babylonian, ruler, marduk, zakir, shumi, ii, who, was, a, puppet, of, the, new, assyrian, king, sennacherib, 705, 681, bc, he, was, once, more, soundly, defeated, at, kish, and, once, again, fled, to, elam, where, he, died, in, exile, after, one, final, failed, attempt, to, raise, a, revolt, against, assyria, in, 700, bc, this, time, not, in, babylon, but, in, the, chaldean, tribal, land, of, bit, y, kin, a, native, babylonian, king, named, bel, ibni, 703, 701, bc, was, placed, on, the, throne, as, a, puppet, of, assyria, the, next, challenge, to, assyrian, domination, came, from, the, elamites, in, 694, bc, with, nergal, ushezib, deposing, and, murdering, ashur, nadin, shumi, 700, 694, bc, the, assyrian, prince, who, was, king, of, babylon, and, son, of, sennacherib, the, chaldeans, and, babylonians, again, allied, with, their, more, powerful, elamite, neighbors, in, this, endeavour, this, prompted, the, enraged, assyrian, king, sennacherib, to, invade, and, subjugate, elam, and, chaldea, and, to, sack, babylon, laying, waste, to, and, largely, destroying, the, city, babylon, was, regarded, as, a, sacred, city, by, all, mesopotamians, including, the, assyrians, and, this, act, eventually, resulted, in, sennacherib, s, being, murdered, by, his, own, sons, while, he, was, praying, to, the, god, nisroch, in, nineveh, esarhaddon, 681, 669, bc, succeeded, sennacherib, as, ruler, of, the, assyrian, empire, he, completely, rebuilt, babylon, and, brought, peace, to, the, region, he, conquered, egypt, nubia, and, libya, and, entrenched, his, mastery, over, the, persians, medes, parthians, scythians, cimmerians, arameans, israelites, phoenicians, canaanites, urartians, pontic, greeks, cilicians, phrygians, lydians, manneans, and, arabs, for, the, next, 60, or, so, years, babylon, and, chaldea, remained, peacefully, under, direct, assyrian, control, the, chaldeans, remained, subjugated, and, quiet, during, this, period, and, the, next, major, revolt, in, babylon, against, the, assyrian, empire, was, fermented, not, by, a, chaldean, babylonian, or, elamite, but, by, shamash, shum, ukin, who, was, an, assyrian, king, of, babylon, and, elder, brother, of, ashurbanipal, 668, 627, bc, the, new, ruler, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, shamash, shum, ukin, 668, 648, bc, had, become, infused, with, babylonian, nationalism, after, sixteen, years, peacefully, subject, to, his, brother, and, despite, being, assyrian, himself, declared, that, the, city, of, babylon, and, not, nineveh, or, assur, should, be, the, seat, of, the, empire, in, 652, bc, he, raised, a, powerful, coalition, of, peoples, resentful, of, their, subjugation, to, assyria, against, his, own, brother, ashurbanipal, the, alliance, included, the, babylonians, persians, chaldeans, medes, elamites, sultans, arameans, israelites, arabs, and, canaanites, together, with, some, disaffected, elements, among, the, assyrians, themselves, after, a, bitter, struggle, lasting, five, years, the, assyrian, king, triumphed, over, his, rebellious, brother, in, 648, bc, elam, was, utterly, destroyed, and, the, babylonians, persians, medes, chaldeans, arabs, and, others, were, savagely, punished, an, assyrian, governor, named, kandalanu, was, then, placed, on, the, throne, of, babylon, to, rule, on, behalf, of, ashurbanipal, the, next, 22, years, were, peaceful, and, neither, the, babylonians, nor, chaldeans, posed, a, threat, to, the, dominance, of, ashurbanipal, however, after, the, death, of, the, mighty, ashurbanipal, and, kandalanu, in, 627, bc, the, neo, assyrian, empire, descended, into, a, series, of, bitter, internal, dynastic, civil, wars, that, were, to, be, the, cause, of, its, downfall, ashur, etil, ilani, 626, 623, bc, ascended, to, the, throne, of, the, empire, in, 626, bc, but, was, immediately, engulfed, in, a, torrent, of, fierce, rebellions, instigated, by, rival, claimants, he, was, deposed, in, 623, bc, by, an, assyrian, general, turtanu, named, sin, shumu, lishir, 623, 622, bc, who, was, also, declared, king, of, babylon, sin, shar, ishkun, 622, 612, bc, the, brother, of, ashur, etil, ilani, took, back, the, throne, of, empire, from, sin, shumu, lishir, in, 622, bc, but, was, then, himself, faced, with, unremitting, rebellion, against, his, rule, by, his, own, people, continual, conflict, among, the, assyrians, led, to, a, myriad, of, subject, peoples, from, cyprus, to, persia, and, the, caucasus, to, egypt, quietly, reasserting, their, independence, and, ceasing, to, pay, tribute, to, assyria, nabopolassar, a, previously, obscure, and, unknown, chaldean, chieftain, followed, the, opportunistic, tactics, laid, down, by, previous, chaldean, leaders, to, take, advantage, of, the, chaos, and, anarchy, gripping, assyria, and, babylonia, and, seized, the, city, of, babylon, in, 620, bc, with, the, help, of, its, native, babylonian, inhabitants, sin, shar, ishkun, amassed, a, powerful, army, and, marched, into, babylon, to, regain, control, of, the, region, nabopolassar, was, saved, from, likely, destruction, because, yet, another, massive, assyrian, rebellion, broke, out, in, assyria, proper, including, the, capital, nineveh, which, forced, the, assyrian, king, to, turn, back, in, order, to, quell, the, revolt, nabopolassar, took, advantage, of, this, situation, seizing, the, ancient, city, of, nippur, in, 619, bc, a, mainstay, of, pro, assyrianism, in, babylonia, and, thus, babylonia, as, a, whole, however, his, position, was, still, far, from, secure, and, bitter, fighting, continued, in, the, babylonian, heartlands, from, 620, to, 615, bc, with, assyrian, forces, encamped, in, babylonia, in, an, attempt, to, eject, nabopolassar, nabopolassar, attempted, a, counterattack, marched, his, army, into, assyria, proper, in, 616, bc, and, tried, to, besiege, assur, and, arrapha, modern, kirkuk, but, was, defeated, by, sin, shar, ishkun, and, chased, back, into, babylonia, after, being, driven, from, idiqlat, modern, tikrit, at, the, southernmost, end, of, assyria, a, stalemate, seemed, to, have, ensued, with, nabopolassar, unable, to, make, any, inroads, into, assyria, despite, its, greatly, weakened, state, and, sin, shar, ishkun, unable, to, eject, nabopolassar, from, babylonia, due, to, constant, rebellions, and, civil, war, among, his, own, people, nabopolassar, s, position, and, the, fate, of, the, assyrian, empire, was, sealed, when, he, entered, into, an, alliance, with, another, of, assyria, s, former, vassals, the, medes, the, now, dominant, people, of, what, was, to, become, persia, the, median, cyaxares, had, also, recently, taken, advantage, of, the, anarchy, in, the, assyrian, empire, while, officially, still, a, vassal, of, assyria, he, took, the, opportunity, to, meld, the, iranian, peoples, the, medes, persians, sagartians, and, parthians, into, a, large, and, powerful, median, dominated, force, the, medes, persians, parthians, chaldeans, and, babylonians, formed, an, alliance, that, also, included, the, scythians, and, cimmerians, to, the, north, while, sin, shar, ishkun, was, fighting, both, the, rebels, in, assyria, and, the, chaldeans, and, babylonians, in, southern, mesopotamia, cyaxares, hitherto, a, vassal, of, assyria, in, alliance, with, the, scythians, and, cimmerians, launched, a, surprise, attack, on, civil, war, beleaguered, assyria, in, 615, bc, sacking, kalhu, the, biblical, calah, nimrud, and, taking, arrapkha, modern, kirkuk, nabopolassar, still, pinned, down, in, southern, mesopotamia, was, not, involved, in, this, major, breakthrough, against, assyria, from, this, point, however, the, alliance, of, medes, persians, chaldeans, babylonians, sagartians, scythians, and, cimmerians, fought, in, unison, against, assyria, despite, the, sorely, depleted, state, of, assyria, bitter, fighting, ensued, throughout, 614, bc, the, alliance, of, powers, continued, to, make, inroads, into, assyria, itself, although, in, 613, bc, the, assyrians, somehow, rallied, to, score, a, number, of, counterattacking, victories, over, the, medes, persians, babylonians, chaldeans, and, scythians, cimmerians, this, led, to, a, coalition, of, forces, ranged, against, it, to, unite, and, launch, a, massive, combined, attack, in, 612, bc, finally, besieging, and, sacking, nineveh, in, late, 612, bc, killing, sin, shar, ishkun, in, the, process, a, new, assyrian, king, ashur, uballit, ii, 612, 605, bc, took, the, crown, amidst, the, house, to, house, fighting, in, nineveh, and, refused, a, request, to, bow, in, vassalage, to, the, rulers, of, the, alliance, he, managed, to, fight, his, way, out, of, nineveh, and, reach, the, northern, assyrian, city, of, harran, where, he, founded, a, new, capital, assyria, resisted, for, another, seven, years, until, 605, bc, when, the, remnants, of, the, assyrian, army, and, the, army, of, the, egyptians, whose, 26th, dynasty, had, formed, a, brief, allied, coalition, with, the, assyrians, were, defeated, at, karchemish, nabopolassar, and, his, median, scythian, and, cimmerian, allies, were, now, in, possession, of, much, of, the, huge, neo, assyrian, empire, the, egyptians, had, belatedly, come, to, the, aid, of, assyria, which, they, would, have, hoped, to, support, as, a, secure, buffer, between, egypt, and, the, new, powers, of, babylon, medes, and, persians, having, already, been, raided, by, the, scythians, the, chaldean, king, of, babylon, now, ruled, all, of, southern, mesopotamia, assyria, in, the, north, was, ruled, by, the, medes, and, the, former, assyrian, possessions, of, aram, syria, phoenicia, israel, cyprus, edom, philistia, and, parts, of, arabia, while, the, medes, took, control, of, the, former, assyrian, colonies, in, ancient, iran, asia, minor, and, the, caucasus, nabopolassar, was, not, able, to, enjoy, his, success, for, long, dying, in, 604, bc, only, one, year, after, the, victory, at, karchemish, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, who, took, the, name, nebuchadnezzar, ii, after, the, unrelated, 12th, century, bc, native, akkadian, babylonian, king, nebuchadnezzar, i, indicating, the, extent, to, which, the, migrant, chaldeans, had, become, infused, with, native, mesopotamian, culture, nebuchadnezzar, ii, and, his, allies, may, well, have, been, forced, to, deal, with, remnants, of, assyrian, resistance, based, in, and, around, dur, katlimmu, as, assyrian, imperial, records, continue, to, be, dated, in, this, region, between, 604, and, 599, bc, in, addition, the, egyptians, remained, in, the, region, an, attempt, to, revive, the, asian, colonies, of, the, ancient, egyptian, empire, nebuchadnezzar, ii, was, to, prove, himself, to, be, the, greatest, of, the, chaldean, rulers, rivaling, another, non, native, ruler, the, 18th, century, bc, amorite, king, hammurabi, as, the, greatest, king, of, babylon, he, was, a, patron, of, the, cities, and, a, spectacular, builder, rebuilding, all, of, babylonia, s, major, cities, on, a, lavish, scale, his, building, activity, at, babylon, expanding, on, the, earlier, major, and, impressive, rebuilding, of, the, assyrian, king, esarhaddon, helped, to, turn, it, into, the, immense, and, beautiful, city, of, legend, babylon, covered, more, than, 8, km, 2, 3, sq, mi, surrounded, by, moats, and, ringed, by, a, double, circuit, of, walls, the, euphrates, flowed, through, the, center, of, the, city, spanned, by, a, beautiful, stone, bridge, at, the, center, of, the, city, rose, the, giant, ziggurat, called, etemenanki, house, of, the, frontier, between, heaven, and, earth, which, lay, next, to, the, temple, of, marduk, he, is, also, believed, by, many, historians, to, have, built, the, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, although, others, believe, these, gardens, were, built, much, earlier, by, an, assyrian, king, in, nineveh, for, his, wife, a, median, princess, from, the, green, mountains, so, that, she, would, feel, at, home, a, capable, leader, nebuchadnezzar, ii, conducted, successful, military, campaigns, cities, like, tyre, sidon, and, damascus, were, subjugated, he, also, conducted, numerous, campaigns, in, asia, minor, against, the, scythians, cimmerians, and, lydians, like, their, assyrian, relations, the, babylonians, had, to, campaign, yearly, in, order, to, control, their, colonies, in, 601, bc, nebuchadnezzar, ii, was, involved, in, a, major, but, inconclusive, battle, against, the, egyptians, in, 599, bc, he, invaded, arabia, and, routed, the, arabs, at, qedar, in, 597, bc, he, invaded, judah, captured, jerusalem, after, the, siege, of, jerusalem, 597, bc, and, deposed, its, king, jehoiachin, carrying, the, israelites, into, captivity, in, babylon, egyptian, and, babylonian, armies, fought, each, other, for, control, of, the, near, east, throughout, much, of, nebuchadnezzar, s, reign, and, this, encouraged, king, zedekiah, of, judah, to, revolt, after, an, eighteen, month, siege, jerusalem, was, captured, in, 587, bc, thousands, of, jews, were, deported, to, babylon, and, solomon, s, temple, was, razed, to, the, ground, nebuchadnezzar, successfully, fought, the, pharaohs, psammetichus, ii, and, apries, throughout, his, reign, and, during, the, reign, of, pharaoh, amasis, in, 568, bc, it, is, rumoured, that, he, may, have, briefly, invaded, egypt, itself, by, 572, nebuchadnezzar, was, in, full, control, of, babylonia, chaldea, aramea, syria, phonecia, israel, judah, philistia, samarra, jordan, northern, arabia, and, parts, of, asia, minor, nebuchadnezzar, died, of, illness, in, 562, bc, after, a, one, year, co, reign, with, his, son, amel, marduk, who, was, deposed, in, 560, bc, after, a, reign, of, only, two, years, neriglissar, succeeded, amel, marduk, it, is, unclear, as, to, whether, he, was, in, fact, an, ethnic, chaldean, or, a, native, babylonian, nobleman, as, he, was, not, related, by, blood, to, nabopolassar, s, descendants, having, married, into, the, ruling, family, he, conducted, successful, military, campaigns, against, the, hellenic, inhabitants, of, cilicia, which, had, threatened, babylonian, interests, neriglissar, reigned, for, only, four, years, and, was, succeeded, by, the, youthful, labashi, marduk, in, 556, bc, again, it, is, unclear, whether, he, was, a, chaldean, or, a, native, babylonian, labashi, marduk, reigned, only, for, a, matter, of, months, being, deposed, by, nabonidus, in, late, 556, bc, nabonidus, was, certainly, not, a, chaldean, but, an, assyrian, from, harran, the, last, capital, of, assyria, and, proved, to, be, the, final, native, mesopotamian, king, of, babylon, he, and, his, son, the, regent, belshazzar, were, deposed, by, the, persians, under, cyrus, the, great, in, 539, bc, when, the, babylonian, empire, was, absorbed, into, the, persian, achaemenid, empire, the, name, chaldean, lost, its, meaning, in, reference, to, a, particular, ethnicity, or, land, but, lingered, for, a, while, as, a, term, solely, and, explicitly, used, to, describe, a, societal, class, of, astrologers, and, astronomers, in, southern, mesopotamia, the, original, chaldean, tribe, had, long, ago, became, akkadianized, adopting, akkadian, culture, religion, language, and, customs, blending, into, the, majority, native, population, and, eventually, wholly, disappearing, as, a, distinct, race, of, people, as, had, been, the, case, with, other, preceding, migrant, peoples, such, as, the, amorites, kassites, suteans, and, arameans, of, babylonia, the, persians, considered, this, chaldean, societal, class, to, be, masters, of, reading, and, writing, and, especially, versed, in, all, forms, of, incantation, sorcery, witchcraft, and, the, magical, arts, they, spoke, of, astrologists, and, astronomers, as, chaldeans, and, it, is, used, with, this, specific, meaning, in, the, book, of, daniel, dan, i, 4, ii, 2, et, seq, and, by, classical, writers, such, as, strabo, the, disappearance, of, the, chaldeans, as, an, ethnicity, and, chaldea, as, a, land, is, evidenced, by, the, fact, that, the, persian, rulers, of, the, achaemenid, empire, 539, 330, bc, did, not, retain, a, province, called, chaldea, nor, did, they, refer, to, chaldeans, as, a, race, of, people, in, their, written, annals, this, is, in, contrast, to, assyria, and, for, a, time, babylonia, also, where, the, persians, retained, the, names, assyria, and, babylonia, as, designations, for, distinct, geo, political, entities, within, the, achaemenid, empire, in, the, case, of, the, assyrians, in, particular, achaemenid, records, show, assyrians, holding, important, positions, within, the, empire, particularly, with, regards, to, military, and, civil, administration, the, term, chaldean, was, still, in, use, at, the, time, of, cicero, 106, 43, bc, long, after, the, chaldeans, had, disappeared, in, one, of, his, speeches, he, mentioned, chaldean, astrologers, and, he, spoke, of, them, more, than, once, in, his, de, divinatione, other, classical, latin, writers, who, speak, of, them, as, distinguished, for, their, knowledge, of, astronomy, and, astrology, are, pliny, the, elder, valerius, maximus, aulus, gellius, cato, the, elder, lucretius, and, juvenal, horace, in, his, carpe, diem, ode, speaks, of, the, babylonian, calculations, babylonii, numeri, the, horoscopes, of, astrologers, consulted, regarding, the, future, in, the, late, antiquity, a, variant, of, aramaic, that, was, used, in, some, books, of, the, bible, was, misnamed, as, chaldean, by, jerome, of, stridon, that, inaccurate, usage, continued, down, the, centuries, in, western, europe, and, it, was, still, customary, during, the, nineteenth, century, until, the, misnomer, was, corrected, by, scholars, in, west, asian, greek, and, hebraic, sources, however, the, term, for, the, language, spoken, in, mesopotamia, was, commonly, assyrian, and, later, also, syriac, accordingly, in, the, earliest, recorded, western, mentions, of, the, christians, of, what, is, now, iraq, and, nearby, countries, chaldean, is, used, with, reference, to, their, language, in, 1220, 1, jacques, de, vitry, wrote, that, they, denied, that, mary, was, the, mother, of, god, and, claimed, that, christ, existed, in, two, persons, they, consecrated, leavened, bread, and, used, the, chaldean, syriac, language, in, the, fifteenth, century, the, term, chaldeans, was, first, applied, specifically, to, assyrians, living, in, cyprus, who, entered, a, union, with, rome, and, no, longer, merely, with, reference, to, their, language, but, the, name, of, a, new, church, in, the, present, chaldea, has, been, associated, with, assyrian, separatism, through, the, chaldean, catholics, and, the, belief, that, their, descent, is, based, southern, babylonia, while, some, religious, leaders, of, the, chaldean, church, and, activists, in, the, west, have, advocated, for, a, separate, identity, based, on, this, notion, historians, and, international, organizations, generally, treat, assyrians, and, chaldeans, as, the, same, group, ethnically, owing, to, genetic, linguistic, geographic, and, modern, historical, factors, however, across, the, rest, of, mesopotamia, particularly, the, north, after, chaldea, fell, the, terms, assyrian, and, its, derivative, syrian, remained, the, common, ethnic, term, for, the, aramaic, speaking, inhabitants, these, were, used, by, the, people, themselves, and, their, persian, armenian, arab, greek, georgian, and, kurdish, neighbours, both, before, and, after, the, advent, of, christianity, in, iraq, northeast, syria, southeast, turkey, and, northwest, iran, the, assyrian, continuity, in, these, regions, is, well, documented, media, related, to, chaldea, at, wikimedia,
