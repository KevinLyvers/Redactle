the, scientific, revolution, was, a, series, of, events, that, marked, the, emergence, of, modern, science, during, the, early, modern, period, when, developments, in, mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology, including, human, anatomy, and, chemistry, transformed, the, views, of, society, about, nature, the, scientific, revolution, took, place, in, europe, in, the, second, half, of, the, renaissance, period, with, the, 1543, nicolaus, copernicus, publication, de, revolutionibus, orbium, coelestium, on, the, revolutions, of, the, heavenly, spheres, often, cited, as, its, beginning, the, era, of, the, scientific, renaissance, focused, to, some, degree, on, recovering, the, knowledge, of, the, ancients, and, is, considered, to, have, culminated, in, isaac, newton, s, 1687, publication, principia, which, formulated, the, laws, of, motion, and, universal, gravitation, thereby, completing, the, synthesis, of, a, new, cosmology, the, subsequent, age, of, enlightenment, saw, the, concept, of, a, scientific, revolution, emerge, in, the, 18th, century, work, of, jean, sylvain, bailly, who, described, a, two, stage, process, of, sweeping, away, the, old, and, establishing, the, new, there, continues, to, be, scholarly, engagement, regarding, the, boundaries, of, the, scientific, revolution, and, its, chronology, great, advances, in, science, have, been, termed, revolutions, since, the, 18th, century, for, example, in, 1747, the, french, mathematician, alexis, clairaut, wrote, that, newton, was, said, in, his, own, life, to, have, created, a, revolution, the, word, was, also, used, in, the, preface, to, antoine, lavoisier, s, 1789, work, announcing, the, discovery, of, oxygen, few, revolutions, in, science, have, immediately, excited, so, much, general, notice, as, the, introduction, of, the, theory, of, oxygen, lavoisier, saw, his, theory, accepted, by, all, the, most, eminent, men, of, his, time, and, established, over, a, great, part, of, europe, within, a, few, years, from, its, first, promulgation, in, the, 19th, century, william, whewell, described, the, revolution, in, science, itself, the, scientific, method, that, had, taken, place, in, the, 15th, 16th, century, among, the, most, conspicuous, of, the, revolutions, which, opinions, on, this, subject, have, undergone, is, the, transition, from, an, implicit, trust, in, the, internal, powers, of, man, s, mind, to, a, professed, dependence, upon, external, observation, and, from, an, unbounded, reverence, for, the, wisdom, of, the, past, to, a, fervid, expectation, of, change, and, improvement, this, gave, rise, to, the, common, view, of, the, scientific, revolution, today, a, new, view, of, nature, emerged, replacing, the, greek, view, that, had, dominated, science, for, almost, 2, 000, years, science, became, an, autonomous, discipline, distinct, from, both, philosophy, and, technology, and, came, to, be, regarded, as, having, utilitarian, goals, the, scientific, revolution, is, traditionally, assumed, to, start, with, the, copernican, revolution, initiated, in, 1543, and, to, be, complete, in, the, grand, synthesis, of, isaac, newton, s, 1687, principia, much, of, the, change, of, attitude, came, from, francis, bacon, whose, confident, and, emphatic, announcement, in, the, modern, progress, of, science, inspired, the, creation, of, scientific, societies, such, as, the, royal, society, and, galileo, who, championed, copernicus, and, developed, the, science, of, motion, the, scientific, revolution, was, enabled, by, advances, in, book, production, before, the, advent, of, the, printing, press, introduced, in, europe, in, the, 1440s, by, johannes, gutenberg, there, was, no, mass, market, on, the, continent, for, scientific, treatises, as, there, had, been, for, religious, books, printing, decisively, changed, the, way, scientific, knowledge, was, created, as, well, as, how, it, was, disseminated, it, enabled, accurate, diagrams, maps, anatomical, drawings, and, representations, of, flora, and, fauna, to, be, reproduced, and, printing, made, scholarly, books, more, widely, accessible, allowing, researchers, to, consult, ancient, texts, freely, and, to, compare, their, own, observations, with, those, of, fellow, scholars, although, printers, blunders, still, often, resulted, in, the, spread, of, false, data, for, instance, in, galileo, s, sidereus, nuncius, the, starry, messenger, published, in, venice, in, 1610, his, telescopic, images, of, the, lunar, surface, mistakenly, appeared, back, to, front, the, development, of, engraved, metal, plates, allowed, accurate, visual, information, to, be, made, permanent, a, change, from, previously, when, woodcut, illustrations, deteriorated, through, repetitive, use, the, ability, to, access, previous, scientific, research, meant, that, researchers, did, not, have, to, always, start, from, scratch, in, making, sense, of, their, own, observational, data, in, the, 20th, century, alexandre, koyr, introduced, the, term, scientific, revolution, centering, his, analysis, on, galileo, the, term, was, popularized, by, herbert, butterfield, in, his, origins, of, modern, science, thomas, kuhn, s, 1962, work, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, emphasizes, that, different, theoretical, frameworks, such, as, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, and, newton, s, theory, of, gravity, which, it, replaced, cannot, be, directly, compared, without, meaning, loss, the, period, saw, a, fundamental, transformation, in, scientific, ideas, across, mathematics, physics, astronomy, and, biology, in, institutions, supporting, scientific, investigation, and, in, the, more, widely, held, picture, of, the, universe, the, scientific, revolution, led, to, the, establishment, of, several, modern, sciences, in, 1984, joseph, ben, david, wrote, rapid, accumulation, of, knowledge, which, has, characterized, the, development, of, science, since, the, 17th, century, had, never, occurred, before, that, time, the, new, kind, of, scientific, activity, emerged, only, in, a, few, countries, of, western, europe, and, it, was, restricted, to, that, small, area, for, about, two, hundred, years, since, the, 19th, century, scientific, knowledge, has, been, assimilated, by, the, rest, of, the, world, many, contemporary, writers, and, modern, historians, claim, that, there, was, a, revolutionary, change, in, world, view, in, 1611, english, poet, john, donne, wrote, new, philosophy, calls, all, in, doubt, the, element, of, fire, is, quite, put, out, the, sun, is, lost, and, th, earth, and, no, man, s, wit, can, well, direct, him, where, to, look, for, it, butterfield, was, less, disconcerted, but, nevertheless, saw, the, change, as, fundamental, since, that, revolution, turned, the, authority, in, english, not, only, of, the, middle, ages, but, of, the, ancient, world, since, it, started, not, only, in, the, eclipse, of, scholastic, philosophy, but, in, the, destruction, of, aristotelian, physics, it, outshines, everything, since, the, rise, of, christianity, and, reduces, the, renaissance, and, reformation, to, the, rank, of, mere, episodes, mere, internal, displacements, within, the, system, of, medieval, christendom, looms, so, large, as, the, real, origin, both, of, the, modern, world, and, of, the, modern, mentality, that, our, customary, periodization, of, european, history, has, become, an, anachronism, and, an, encumbrance, historian, peter, harrison, attributes, christianity, to, having, contributed, to, the, rise, of, the, scientific, revolution, historians, of, science, have, long, known, that, religious, factors, played, a, significantly, positive, role, in, the, emergence, and, persistence, of, modern, science, in, the, west, not, only, were, many, of, the, key, figures, in, the, rise, of, science, individuals, with, sincere, religious, commitments, but, the, new, approaches, to, nature, that, they, pioneered, were, underpinned, in, various, ways, by, religious, assumptions, yet, many, of, the, leading, figures, in, the, scientific, revolution, imagined, themselves, to, be, champions, of, a, science, that, was, more, compatible, with, christianity, than, the, medieval, ideas, about, the, natural, world, that, they, replaced, the, scientific, revolution, was, built, upon, the, foundation, of, ancient, greek, learning, and, science, in, the, middle, ages, as, it, had, been, elaborated, and, further, developed, by, roman, byzantine, science, and, medieval, islamic, science, some, scholars, have, noted, a, direct, tie, between, particular, aspects, of, traditional, christianity, and, the, rise, of, science, the, aristotelian, tradition, was, still, an, important, intellectual, framework, in, the, 17th, century, although, by, that, time, natural, philosophers, had, moved, away, from, much, of, it, key, scientific, ideas, dating, back, to, classical, antiquity, had, changed, drastically, over, the, years, and, in, many, cases, had, been, discredited, the, ideas, that, remained, which, were, transformed, fundamentally, during, the, scientific, revolution, include, ancient, precedent, existed, for, alternative, theories, and, developments, which, prefigured, later, discoveries, in, the, area, of, physics, and, mechanics, but, in, light, of, the, limited, number, of, works, to, survive, translation, in, a, period, when, many, books, were, lost, to, warfare, such, developments, remained, obscure, for, centuries, and, are, traditionally, held, to, have, had, little, effect, on, the, re, discovery, of, such, phenomena, whereas, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, made, the, wide, dissemination, of, such, incremental, advances, of, knowledge, commonplace, meanwhile, however, significant, progress, in, geometry, mathematics, and, astronomy, was, made, in, medieval, times, it, is, also, true, that, many, of, the, important, figures, of, the, scientific, revolution, shared, in, the, general, renaissance, respect, for, ancient, learning, and, cited, ancient, pedigrees, for, their, innovations, copernicus, galileo, johannes, kepler, and, newton, all, traced, different, ancient, and, medieval, ancestries, for, the, heliocentric, system, in, the, axioms, scholium, of, his, principia, newton, said, its, axiomatic, three, laws, of, motion, were, already, accepted, by, mathematicians, such, as, christiaan, huygens, wallace, wren, and, others, while, preparing, a, revised, edition, of, his, principia, newton, attributed, his, law, of, gravity, and, his, first, law, of, motion, to, a, range, of, historical, figures, despite, these, qualifications, the, standard, theory, of, the, history, of, the, scientific, revolution, claims, that, the, 17th, century, was, a, period, of, revolutionary, scientific, changes, not, only, were, there, revolutionary, theoretical, and, experimental, developments, but, that, even, more, importantly, the, way, in, which, scientists, worked, was, radically, changed, for, instance, although, intimations, of, the, concept, of, inertia, are, suggested, sporadically, in, ancient, discussion, of, motion, the, salient, point, is, that, newton, s, theory, differed, from, ancient, understandings, in, key, ways, such, as, an, external, force, being, a, requirement, for, violent, motion, in, aristotle, s, theory, under, the, scientific, method, as, conceived, in, the, 17th, century, natural, and, artificial, circumstances, were, set, aside, as, a, research, tradition, of, systematic, experimentation, was, slowly, accepted, by, the, scientific, community, the, philosophy, of, using, an, inductive, approach, to, obtain, knowledge, to, abandon, assumption, and, to, attempt, to, observe, with, an, open, mind, was, in, contrast, with, the, earlier, aristotelian, approach, of, deduction, by, which, analysis, of, known, facts, produced, further, understanding, in, practice, many, scientists, and, philosophers, believed, that, a, healthy, mix, of, both, was, needed, the, willingness, to, question, assumptions, yet, also, to, interpret, observations, assumed, to, have, some, degree, of, validity, by, the, end, of, the, scientific, revolution, the, qualitative, world, of, book, reading, philosophers, had, been, changed, into, a, mechanical, mathematical, world, to, be, known, through, experimental, research, though, it, is, certainly, not, true, that, newtonian, science, was, like, modern, science, in, all, respects, it, conceptually, resembled, ours, in, many, ways, many, of, the, hallmarks, of, modern, science, especially, with, regard, to, its, institutionalization, and, professionalization, did, not, become, standard, until, the, mid, 19th, century, the, aristotelian, scientific, tradition, s, primary, mode, of, interacting, with, the, world, was, through, observation, and, searching, for, natural, circumstances, through, reasoning, coupled, with, this, approach, was, the, belief, that, rare, events, which, seemed, to, contradict, theoretical, models, were, aberrations, telling, nothing, about, nature, as, it, naturally, was, during, the, scientific, revolution, changing, perceptions, about, the, role, of, the, scientist, in, respect, to, nature, the, value, of, evidence, experimental, or, observed, led, towards, a, scientific, methodology, in, which, empiricism, played, a, large, role, by, the, start, of, the, scientific, revolution, empiricism, had, already, become, an, important, component, of, science, and, natural, philosophy, prior, thinkers, including, the, early, 14th, century, nominalist, philosopher, william, of, ockham, had, begun, the, intellectual, movement, toward, empiricism, the, term, british, empiricism, came, into, use, to, describe, philosophical, differences, perceived, between, two, of, its, founders, francis, bacon, described, as, empiricist, and, ren, descartes, who, was, described, as, a, rationalist, thomas, hobbes, george, berkeley, and, david, hume, were, the, philosophy, s, primary, exponents, who, developed, a, sophisticated, empirical, tradition, as, the, basis, of, human, knowledge, an, influential, formulation, of, empiricism, was, john, locke, s, an, essay, concerning, human, understanding, 1689, in, which, he, maintained, that, the, only, true, knowledge, that, could, be, accessible, to, the, human, mind, was, that, which, was, based, on, experience, he, wrote, that, the, human, mind, was, created, as, a, tabula, rasa, a, blank, tablet, upon, which, sensory, impressions, were, recorded, and, built, up, knowledge, through, a, process, of, reflection, the, philosophical, underpinnings, of, the, scientific, revolution, were, laid, out, by, francis, bacon, who, has, been, called, the, father, of, empiricism, his, works, established, and, popularised, inductive, methodologies, for, scientific, inquiry, often, called, the, baconian, method, or, simply, the, scientific, method, his, demand, for, a, planned, procedure, of, investigating, all, things, natural, marked, a, new, turn, in, the, rhetorical, and, theoretical, framework, for, science, much, of, which, still, surrounds, conceptions, of, proper, methodology, today, bacon, proposed, a, great, reformation, of, all, process, of, knowledge, for, the, advancement, of, learning, divine, and, human, which, he, called, instauratio, magna, the, great, instauration, for, bacon, this, reformation, would, lead, to, a, great, advancement, in, science, and, a, progeny, of, inventions, that, would, relieve, mankind, s, miseries, and, needs, his, novum, organum, was, published, in, 1620, in, which, he, argues, man, is, the, minister, and, interpreter, of, nature, knowledge, and, human, power, are, synonymous, effects, are, produced, by, the, means, of, instruments, and, helps, man, while, operating, can, only, apply, or, withdraw, natural, bodies, nature, internally, performs, the, rest, and, nature, can, only, be, commanded, by, obeying, her, here, is, an, abstract, of, the, philosophy, of, this, work, that, by, the, knowledge, of, nature, and, the, using, of, instruments, man, can, govern, or, direct, the, natural, work, of, nature, to, produce, definite, results, therefore, that, man, by, seeking, knowledge, of, nature, can, reach, power, over, it, and, thus, reestablish, the, empire, of, man, over, creation, which, had, been, lost, by, the, fall, together, with, man, s, original, purity, in, this, way, he, believed, would, mankind, be, raised, above, conditions, of, helplessness, poverty, and, misery, while, coming, into, a, condition, of, peace, prosperity, and, security, for, this, purpose, of, obtaining, knowledge, of, and, power, over, nature, bacon, outlined, in, this, work, a, new, system, of, logic, he, believed, to, be, superior, to, the, old, ways, of, syllogism, developing, his, scientific, method, consisting, of, procedures, for, isolating, the, formal, cause, of, a, phenomenon, heat, for, example, through, eliminative, induction, for, him, the, philosopher, should, proceed, through, inductive, reasoning, from, fact, to, axiom, to, physical, law, before, beginning, this, induction, though, the, enquirer, must, free, his, or, her, mind, from, certain, false, notions, or, tendencies, which, distort, the, truth, in, particular, he, found, that, philosophy, was, too, preoccupied, with, words, particularly, discourse, and, debate, rather, than, actually, observing, the, material, world, for, while, men, believe, their, reason, governs, words, in, fact, words, turn, back, and, reflect, their, power, upon, the, understanding, and, so, render, philosophy, and, science, sophistical, and, inactive, bacon, considered, that, it, is, of, greatest, importance, to, science, not, to, keep, doing, intellectual, discussions, or, seeking, merely, contemplative, aims, but, that, it, should, work, for, the, bettering, of, mankind, s, life, by, bringing, forth, new, inventions, even, stating, inventions, are, also, as, it, were, new, creations, and, imitations, of, divine, works, he, explored, the, far, reaching, and, world, changing, character, of, inventions, such, as, the, printing, press, gunpowder, and, the, compass, despite, his, influence, on, scientific, methodology, he, rejected, correct, novel, theories, such, as, william, gilbert, s, magnetism, copernicus, s, heliocentrism, and, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, bacon, first, described, the, experimental, method, there, remains, simple, experience, which, if, taken, as, it, comes, is, called, accident, if, sought, for, experiment, the, true, method, of, experience, first, lights, the, candle, and, then, by, means, of, the, candle, shows, the, way, commencing, as, it, does, with, experience, duly, ordered, and, digested, not, bungling, or, erratic, and, from, it, deducing, axioms, and, from, established, axioms, again, new, experiments, gilbert, was, an, early, advocate, of, this, method, he, passionately, rejected, both, the, prevailing, aristotelian, philosophy, and, the, scholastic, method, of, university, teaching, his, book, de, magnete, was, written, in, 1600, and, he, is, regarded, by, some, as, the, father, of, electricity, and, magnetism, in, this, work, he, describes, many, of, his, experiments, with, his, model, earth, called, the, terrella, from, these, experiments, he, concluded, that, the, earth, was, itself, magnetic, and, that, this, was, the, reason, compasses, point, north, de, magnete, was, influential, because, of, the, inherent, interest, of, its, subject, matter, as, well, as, for, the, rigorous, way, in, which, gilbert, describes, his, experiments, and, his, rejection, of, ancient, theories, of, magnetism, according, to, thomas, thomson, gilbert, book, on, magnetism, published, in, 1600, is, one, of, the, finest, examples, of, inductive, philosophy, that, has, ever, been, presented, to, the, world, it, is, the, more, remarkable, because, it, preceded, the, novum, organum, of, bacon, in, which, the, inductive, method, of, philosophizing, was, first, explained, galileo, galilei, has, been, called, the, father, of, modern, observational, astronomy, the, father, of, modern, physics, the, father, of, science, and, the, father, of, modern, science, his, original, contributions, to, the, science, of, motion, were, made, through, an, innovative, combination, of, experiment, and, mathematics, galileo, was, one, of, the, first, modern, thinkers, to, clearly, state, that, the, laws, of, nature, are, mathematical, in, the, assayer, he, wrote, philosophy, is, written, in, this, grand, book, the, universe, it, is, written, in, the, language, of, mathematics, and, its, characters, are, triangles, circles, and, other, geometric, figures, his, mathematical, analyses, are, a, further, development, of, a, tradition, employed, by, late, scholastic, natural, philosophers, which, galileo, learned, when, he, studied, philosophy, he, ignored, aristotelianism, in, broader, terms, his, work, marked, another, step, towards, the, eventual, separation, of, science, from, both, philosophy, and, religion, a, major, development, in, human, thought, he, was, often, willing, to, change, his, views, in, accordance, with, observation, in, order, to, perform, his, experiments, galileo, had, to, set, up, standards, of, length, and, time, so, that, measurements, made, on, different, days, and, in, different, laboratories, could, be, compared, in, a, reproducible, fashion, this, provided, a, reliable, foundation, on, which, to, confirm, mathematical, laws, using, inductive, reasoning, galileo, showed, an, appreciation, for, the, relationship, between, mathematics, theoretical, physics, and, experimental, physics, he, understood, the, parabola, both, in, terms, of, conic, sections, and, in, terms, of, the, ordinate, y, varying, as, the, square, of, the, abscissa, x, galilei, further, asserted, that, the, parabola, was, the, theoretically, ideal, trajectory, of, a, uniformly, accelerated, projectile, in, the, absence, of, friction, and, other, disturbances, he, conceded, that, there, are, limits, to, the, validity, of, this, theory, noting, on, theoretical, grounds, that, a, projectile, trajectory, of, a, size, comparable, to, that, of, the, earth, could, not, possibly, be, a, parabola, but, he, nevertheless, maintained, that, for, distances, up, to, the, range, of, the, artillery, of, his, day, the, deviation, of, a, projectile, s, trajectory, from, a, parabola, would, be, only, very, slight, scientific, knowledge, according, to, the, aristotelians, was, concerned, with, establishing, true, and, necessary, causes, of, things, to, the, extent, that, medieval, natural, philosophers, used, mathematical, problems, they, limited, social, studies, to, theoretical, analyses, of, local, speed, and, other, aspects, of, life, the, actual, measurement, of, a, physical, quantity, and, the, comparison, of, that, measurement, to, a, value, computed, on, the, basis, of, theory, was, largely, limited, to, the, mathematical, disciplines, of, astronomy, and, optics, in, europe, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, european, scientists, began, increasingly, applying, quantitative, measurements, to, the, measurement, of, physical, phenomena, on, the, earth, galileo, maintained, strongly, that, mathematics, provided, a, kind, of, necessary, certainty, that, could, be, compared, to, god, s, with, regard, to, those, few, which, the, human, intellect, does, understand, i, believe, its, knowledge, equals, the, divine, in, objective, certainty, galileo, anticipates, the, concept, of, a, systematic, mathematical, interpretation, of, the, world, in, his, book, il, saggiatore, philosophy, is, written, in, this, grand, book, i, mean, the, universe, which, stands, continually, open, to, our, gaze, but, it, cannot, be, understood, unless, one, first, learns, to, comprehend, the, language, and, interpret, the, characters, in, which, it, is, written, it, is, written, in, the, language, of, mathematics, and, its, characters, are, triangles, circles, and, other, geometrical, figures, without, which, it, is, humanly, impossible, to, understand, a, single, word, of, it, without, these, one, is, wandering, around, in, a, dark, labyrinth, in, 1591, fran, ois, vi, te, published, in, artem, analyticem, isagoge, which, gave, the, first, symbolic, notation, of, parameters, in, algebra, newton, s, development, of, infinitesimal, calculus, opened, up, new, applications, of, the, methods, of, mathematics, to, science, newton, taught, that, scientific, theory, should, be, coupled, with, rigorous, experimentation, which, became, the, keystone, of, modern, science, aristotle, recognized, four, kinds, of, causes, and, where, applicable, the, most, important, of, them, is, the, final, cause, the, final, cause, was, the, aim, goal, or, purpose, of, some, natural, process, or, man, made, thing, until, the, scientific, revolution, it, was, very, natural, to, see, such, aims, such, as, a, child, s, growth, for, example, leading, to, a, mature, adult, intelligence, was, assumed, only, in, the, purpose, of, man, made, artifacts, it, was, not, attributed, to, other, animals, or, to, nature, in, mechanical, philosophy, no, field, or, action, at, a, distance, is, permitted, particles, or, corpuscles, of, matter, are, fundamentally, inert, motion, is, caused, by, direct, physical, collision, where, natural, substances, had, previously, been, understood, organically, the, mechanical, philosophers, viewed, them, as, machines, as, a, result, newton, s, theory, seemed, like, some, kind, of, throwback, to, spooky, action, at, a, distance, according, to, thomas, kuhn, newton, and, descartes, held, the, teleological, principle, that, god, conserved, the, amount, of, motion, in, the, universe, gravity, interpreted, as, an, innate, attraction, between, every, pair, of, particles, of, matter, was, an, occult, quality, in, the, same, sense, as, the, scholastics, tendency, to, fall, had, been, by, the, mid, eighteenth, century, that, interpretation, had, been, almost, universally, accepted, and, the, result, was, a, genuine, reversion, which, is, not, the, same, as, a, retrogression, to, a, scholastic, standard, innate, attractions, and, repulsions, joined, size, shape, position, and, motion, as, physically, irreducible, primary, properties, of, matter, newton, had, also, specifically, attributed, the, inherent, power, of, inertia, to, matter, against, the, mechanist, thesis, that, matter, has, no, inherent, powers, but, whereas, newton, vehemently, denied, gravity, was, an, inherent, power, of, matter, his, collaborator, roger, cotes, made, gravity, also, an, inherent, power, of, matter, as, set, out, in, his, famous, preface, to, the, principia, s, 1713, second, edition, which, he, edited, and, contradicted, newton, and, it, was, cotes, s, interpretation, of, gravity, rather, than, newton, s, that, came, to, be, accepted, the, first, moves, towards, the, institutionalization, of, scientific, investigation, and, dissemination, took, the, form, of, the, establishment, of, societies, where, new, discoveries, were, aired, discussed, and, published, the, first, scientific, society, to, be, established, was, the, royal, society, of, london, this, grew, out, of, an, earlier, group, centered, around, gresham, college, in, the, 1640s, and, 1650s, according, to, a, history, of, the, college, the, scientific, network, which, centered, on, gresham, college, played, a, crucial, part, in, the, meetings, which, led, to, the, formation, of, the, royal, society, these, physicians, and, natural, philosophers, were, influenced, by, the, new, science, as, promoted, by, bacon, in, his, new, atlantis, from, approximately, 1645, onwards, a, group, known, as, the, philosophical, society, of, oxford, was, run, under, a, set, of, rules, still, retained, by, the, bodleian, library, on, 28, november, 1660, the, 1660, committee, of, 12, announced, the, formation, of, a, college, for, the, promoting, of, physico, mathematical, experimental, learning, which, would, meet, weekly, to, discuss, science, and, run, experiments, at, the, second, meeting, robert, moray, announced, that, king, charles, approved, of, the, gatherings, and, a, royal, charter, was, signed, on, 15, july, 1662, creating, the, royal, society, of, london, with, lord, brouncker, serving, as, the, first, president, a, second, royal, charter, was, signed, on, 23, april, 1663, with, the, king, noted, as, the, founder, and, with, the, name, of, the, royal, society, of, london, for, the, improvement, of, natural, knowledge, robert, hooke, was, appointed, as, curator, of, experiments, in, november, this, initial, royal, favour, has, continued, and, since, then, every, monarch, has, been, the, patron, of, the, society, the, society, s, first, secretary, was, henry, oldenburg, its, early, meetings, included, experiments, performed, first, by, hooke, and, then, by, denis, papin, who, was, appointed, in, 1684, these, experiments, varied, in, their, subject, area, and, were, important, in, some, cases, and, trivial, in, others, the, society, began, publication, of, philosophical, transactions, from, 1665, the, oldest, and, longest, running, scientific, journal, in, the, world, which, established, the, important, principles, of, scientific, priority, and, peer, review, the, french, established, the, academy, of, sciences, in, 1666, in, contrast, to, the, private, origins, of, its, british, counterpart, the, academy, was, founded, as, a, government, body, by, jean, baptiste, colbert, its, rules, were, set, down, in, 1699, by, king, louis, xiv, when, it, received, the, name, of, royal, academy, of, sciences, and, was, installed, in, the, louvre, in, paris, as, the, scientific, revolution, was, not, marked, by, any, single, change, the, following, new, ideas, contributed, to, what, is, called, the, scientific, revolution, many, of, them, were, revolutions, in, their, own, fields, for, almost, five, millennia, the, geocentric, model, of, the, earth, as, the, center, of, the, universe, had, been, accepted, by, all, but, a, few, astronomers, in, aristotle, s, cosmology, earth, s, central, location, was, perhaps, less, significant, than, its, identification, as, a, realm, of, imperfection, inconstancy, irregularity, and, change, as, opposed, to, the, heavens, moon, sun, planets, stars, which, were, regarded, as, perfect, permanent, unchangeable, and, in, religious, thought, the, realm, of, heavenly, beings, the, earth, was, even, composed, of, different, material, the, four, elements, earth, water, fire, and, air, while, sufficiently, far, above, its, surface, roughly, the, moon, s, orbit, the, heavens, were, composed, of, a, different, substance, called, aether, the, heliocentric, model, that, replaced, it, involved, the, radical, displacement, of, the, earth, to, an, orbit, around, the, sun, sharing, a, placement, with, the, other, planets, implied, a, universe, of, heavenly, components, made, from, the, same, changeable, substances, as, the, earth, heavenly, motions, no, longer, needed, to, be, governed, by, a, theoretical, perfection, confined, to, circular, orbits, copernicus, 1543, work, on, the, heliocentric, model, of, the, solar, system, tried, to, demonstrate, that, the, sun, was, the, center, of, the, universe, few, were, bothered, by, this, suggestion, and, the, pope, and, several, archbishops, were, interested, enough, by, it, to, want, more, detail, his, model, was, later, used, to, create, the, calendar, of, pope, gregory, xiii, however, the, idea, that, the, earth, moved, around, the, sun, was, doubted, by, most, of, copernicus, contemporaries, it, contradicted, not, only, empirical, observation, due, to, the, absence, of, an, observable, stellar, parallax, but, more, significantly, at, the, time, the, authority, of, aristotle, the, discoveries, of, kepler, and, galileo, gave, the, theory, credibility, kepler, was, an, astronomer, who, is, best, known, for, his, laws, of, planetary, motion, and, kepler, s, books, astronomia, nova, harmonice, mundi, and, epitome, astronomiae, copernicanae, influenced, among, others, isaac, newton, providing, one, of, the, foundations, for, his, theory, of, universal, gravitation, one, of, the, most, significant, books, in, the, history, of, astronomy, the, astronomia, nova, provided, strong, arguments, for, heliocentrism, and, contributed, valuable, insight, into, the, movement, of, the, planets, this, included, the, first, mention, of, the, planets, elliptical, paths, and, the, change, of, their, movement, to, the, movement, of, free, floating, bodies, as, opposed, to, objects, on, rotating, spheres, it, is, recognized, as, one, of, the, most, important, works, of, the, scientific, revolution, using, the, accurate, observations, of, tycho, brahe, kepler, proposed, that, the, planets, move, around, the, sun, not, in, circular, orbits, but, in, elliptical, ones, together, with, kepler, s, other, laws, of, planetary, motion, this, allowed, him, to, create, a, model, of, the, solar, system, that, was, an, improvement, over, copernicus, original, system, galileo, s, main, contributions, to, the, acceptance, of, the, heliocentric, system, were, his, mechanics, the, observations, he, made, with, his, telescope, as, well, as, his, detailed, presentation, of, the, case, for, the, system, using, an, early, theory, of, inertia, galileo, could, explain, why, rocks, dropped, from, a, tower, fall, straight, down, even, if, the, earth, rotates, his, observations, of, the, moons, of, jupiter, the, phases, of, venus, the, spots, on, the, sun, and, mountains, on, the, moon, all, helped, to, discredit, the, aristotelian, philosophy, and, the, ptolemaic, theory, of, the, solar, system, through, their, combined, discoveries, the, heliocentric, system, gained, support, and, at, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, it, was, generally, accepted, by, astronomers, this, work, culminated, in, the, work, of, newton, and, his, principia, formulated, the, laws, of, motion, and, universal, gravitation, which, dominated, scientists, view, of, the, physical, universe, for, the, next, three, centuries, by, deriving, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, from, his, mathematical, description, of, gravity, and, then, using, the, same, principles, to, account, for, the, trajectories, of, comets, the, tides, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, and, other, phenomena, newton, removed, the, last, doubts, about, the, validity, of, the, heliocentric, model, of, the, cosmos, this, work, also, demonstrated, that, the, motion, of, objects, on, earth, and, of, celestial, bodies, could, be, described, by, the, same, principles, his, prediction, that, the, earth, should, be, shaped, as, an, oblate, spheroid, was, later, vindicated, by, other, scientists, his, laws, of, motion, were, to, be, the, solid, foundation, of, mechanics, his, law, of, universal, gravitation, combined, terrestrial, and, celestial, mechanics, into, one, great, system, that, seemed, to, be, able, to, describe, the, whole, world, in, mathematical, formulae, newton, also, developed, the, theory, of, gravitation, in, 1679, newton, began, to, consider, gravitation, and, its, effect, on, the, orbits, of, planets, with, reference, to, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, this, followed, stimulation, by, a, brief, exchange, of, letters, in, 1679, 80, with, hooke, opened, a, correspondence, intended, to, elicit, contributions, from, newton, to, royal, society, transactions, newton, s, reawakening, interest, in, astronomical, matters, received, further, stimulus, by, the, appearance, of, a, comet, in, the, winter, of, 1680, 81, on, which, he, corresponded, with, john, flamsteed, after, the, exchanges, with, hooke, newton, worked, out, proof, that, the, elliptical, form, of, planetary, orbits, would, result, from, a, centripetal, force, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, radius, vector, newton, communicated, his, results, to, edmond, halley, and, to, the, royal, society, in, de, motu, corporum, in, gyrum, in, 1684, this, tract, contained, the, nucleus, that, newton, developed, and, expanded, to, form, the, principia, the, principia, was, published, on, 5, july, 1687, with, encouragement, and, financial, help, from, halley, in, this, work, newton, states, the, three, universal, laws, of, motion, that, contributed, to, many, advances, during, the, industrial, revolution, which, soon, followed, and, were, not, to, be, improved, upon, for, more, than, 200, years, many, of, these, advancements, continue, to, be, the, underpinnings, of, non, relativistic, technologies, in, the, modern, world, he, used, the, latin, word, gravitas, weight, for, the, effect, that, would, become, known, as, gravity, and, defined, the, law, of, universal, gravitation, newton, s, postulate, of, an, invisible, force, able, to, act, over, vast, distances, led, to, him, being, criticised, for, introducing, occult, agencies, into, science, later, in, the, second, edition, of, the, principia, 1713, newton, firmly, rejected, such, criticisms, in, a, concluding, general, scholium, writing, that, it, was, enough, that, the, phenomena, implied, a, gravitational, attraction, as, they, did, but, they, did, not, so, far, indicate, its, cause, and, it, was, both, unnecessary, and, improper, to, frame, hypotheses, of, things, that, were, not, implied, by, the, phenomena, here, newton, used, what, became, his, famous, expression, hypotheses, non, fingo, the, writings, of, greek, physician, galen, had, dominated, european, medical, thinking, for, over, a, millennium, the, flemish, scholar, andreas, vesalius, demonstrated, mistakes, in, galen, s, ideas, vesalius, dissected, human, corpses, whereas, galen, dissected, animal, corpses, published, in, 1543, vesalius, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, was, a, groundbreaking, work, of, human, anatomy, it, emphasized, the, priority, of, dissection, and, what, has, come, to, be, called, the, anatomical, view, of, the, body, seeing, human, internal, functioning, as, an, essentially, corporeal, structure, filled, with, organs, arranged, in, three, dimensional, space, this, was, in, stark, contrast, to, many, of, the, anatomical, models, used, previously, which, had, strong, galenic, aristotelean, elements, as, well, as, elements, of, astrology, besides, the, first, good, description, of, the, sphenoid, bone, vesalius, showed, that, the, sternum, consists, of, three, portions, and, the, sacrum, of, five, or, six, and, he, described, accurately, the, vestibule, in, the, interior, of, the, temporal, bone, he, verified, the, observation, of, anatomist, charles, estienne, on, the, valves, of, the, hepatic, veins, described, the, vena, azygos, and, discovered, the, canal, which, passes, in, the, fetus, between, the, umbilical, vein, and, the, vena, cava, since, named, ductus, venosus, he, described, the, omentum, and, its, connections, with, the, stomach, the, spleen, and, the, colon, gave, the, first, correct, views, of, the, structure, of, the, pylorus, observed, the, small, size, of, the, caecal, appendix, in, man, gave, the, first, good, account, of, the, mediastinum, and, pleura, and, the, fullest, description, of, the, anatomy, of, the, brain, yet, advanced, before, vesalius, the, anatomical, notes, by, alessandro, achillini, demonstrate, a, detailed, description, of, the, human, body, and, compare, what, he, had, found, during, his, dissections, to, what, others, like, galen, and, avicenna, had, found, and, notes, their, similarities, and, differences, niccol, massa, was, an, italian, anatomist, who, wrote, an, early, anatomy, text, anatomiae, libri, introductorius, in, 1536, described, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, and, was, the, author, of, several, medical, works, jean, fernel, was, a, french, physician, who, introduced, the, term, physiology, to, describe, the, study, of, the, body, s, function, and, was, the, first, person, to, describe, the, spinal, canal, further, groundbreaking, work, was, carried, out, by, william, harvey, who, published, de, motu, cordis, in, 1628, harvey, made, a, detailed, analysis, of, the, overall, structure, of, the, heart, going, on, to, an, analysis, of, the, arteries, showing, how, their, pulsation, depends, upon, the, contraction, of, the, left, ventricle, while, the, contraction, of, the, right, ventricle, propels, its, charge, of, blood, into, the, pulmonary, artery, he, noticed, that, the, two, ventricles, move, together, almost, simultaneously, and, not, independently, like, had, been, thought, previously, by, his, predecessors, harvey, estimated, the, capacity, of, the, heart, how, much, blood, is, expelled, through, each, pump, of, the, heart, and, the, number, of, times, the, heart, beats, in, half, an, hour, from, these, estimations, he, demonstrated, that, according, to, gaelen, s, theory, that, blood, was, continually, produced, in, the, liver, the, absurdly, large, figure, of, 540, pounds, of, blood, would, have, to, be, produced, every, day, having, this, simple, mathematical, proportion, at, hand, which, would, imply, a, seemingly, impossible, role, for, the, liver, harvey, went, on, to, demonstrate, how, the, blood, circulated, in, a, circle, by, means, of, countless, experiments, initially, done, on, serpents, and, fish, tying, their, veins, and, arteries, in, separate, periods, of, time, harvey, noticed, the, modifications, which, occurred, indeed, as, he, tied, the, veins, the, heart, would, become, empty, while, as, he, did, the, same, to, the, arteries, the, organ, would, swell, up, this, process, was, later, performed, on, the, human, body, the, physician, tied, a, tight, ligature, onto, the, upper, arm, of, a, person, this, would, cut, off, blood, flow, from, the, arteries, and, the, veins, when, this, was, done, the, arm, below, the, ligature, was, cool, and, pale, while, above, the, ligature, it, was, warm, and, swollen, the, ligature, was, loosened, slightly, which, allowed, blood, from, the, arteries, to, come, into, the, arm, since, arteries, are, deeper, in, the, flesh, than, the, veins, when, this, was, done, the, opposite, effect, was, seen, in, the, lower, arm, it, was, now, warm, and, swollen, the, veins, were, also, more, visible, since, now, they, were, full, of, blood, various, other, advances, in, medical, understanding, and, practice, were, made, french, physician, pierre, fauchard, started, dentistry, science, as, we, know, it, today, and, he, has, been, named, the, father, of, modern, dentistry, surgeon, ambroise, par, was, a, leader, in, surgical, techniques, and, battlefield, medicine, especially, the, treatment, of, wounds, and, herman, boerhaave, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, father, of, physiology, because, of, his, exemplary, teaching, in, leiden, and, his, textbook, institutiones, medicae, 1708, chemistry, and, its, antecedent, alchemy, became, an, increasingly, important, aspect, of, scientific, thought, in, the, course, of, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, the, importance, of, chemistry, is, indicated, by, the, range, of, important, scholars, who, actively, engaged, in, chemical, research, among, them, were, the, astronomer, tycho, brahe, the, chemical, physician, paracelsus, robert, boyle, thomas, browne, and, isaac, newton, unlike, the, mechanical, philosophy, the, chemical, philosophy, stressed, the, active, powers, of, matter, which, alchemists, frequently, expressed, in, terms, of, vital, or, active, principles, of, spirits, operating, in, nature, practical, attempts, to, improve, the, refining, of, ores, and, their, extraction, to, smelt, metals, were, an, important, source, of, information, for, early, chemists, in, the, 16th, century, among, them, georgius, agricola, who, published, his, great, work, de, re, metallica, in, 1556, his, work, describes, the, highly, developed, and, complex, processes, of, mining, metal, ores, metal, extraction, and, metallurgy, of, the, time, his, approach, removed, the, mysticism, associated, with, the, subject, creating, the, practical, base, upon, which, others, could, build, chemist, robert, boyle, is, considered, to, have, refined, the, modern, scientific, method, for, alchemy, and, to, have, separated, chemistry, further, from, alchemy, although, his, research, clearly, has, its, roots, in, the, alchemical, tradition, boyle, is, largely, regarded, today, as, the, first, modern, chemist, and, therefore, one, of, the, founders, of, modern, chemistry, and, one, of, the, pioneers, of, modern, experimental, scientific, method, although, boyle, was, not, the, original, discoverer, he, is, best, known, for, boyle, s, law, which, he, presented, in, 1662, the, law, describes, the, inversely, proportional, relationship, between, the, absolute, pressure, and, volume, of, a, gas, if, the, temperature, is, kept, constant, within, a, closed, system, boyle, is, also, credited, for, his, landmark, publication, the, sceptical, chymist, in, 1661, which, is, seen, as, a, cornerstone, book, in, the, field, of, chemistry, in, the, work, boyle, presents, his, hypothesis, that, every, phenomenon, was, the, result, of, collisions, of, particles, in, motion, boyle, appealed, to, chemists, to, experiment, and, asserted, that, experiments, denied, the, limiting, of, chemical, elements, to, only, the, classic, four, earth, fire, air, and, water, he, also, pleaded, that, chemistry, should, cease, to, be, subservient, to, medicine, or, to, alchemy, and, rise, to, the, status, of, a, science, importantly, he, advocated, a, rigorous, approach, to, scientific, experiment, he, believed, all, theories, must, be, tested, experimentally, before, being, regarded, as, true, the, work, contains, some, of, the, earliest, modern, ideas, of, atoms, molecules, and, chemical, reaction, and, marks, the, beginning, of, modern, chemistry, in, 1604, johannes, kepler, published, astronomiae, pars, optica, the, optical, part, of, astronomy, in, it, he, describes, the, inverse, square, law, governing, the, intensity, of, light, reflection, by, flat, and, curved, mirrors, and, principles, of, pinhole, cameras, as, well, as, the, astronomical, implications, of, optics, such, as, parallax, and, the, apparent, sizes, of, heavenly, bodies, astronomiae, pars, optica, is, generally, recognized, as, the, foundation, of, modern, optics, willebrord, snellius, found, the, mathematical, law, of, refraction, now, known, as, snell, s, law, in, 1621, it, had, been, published, earlier, in, 984, ad, by, ibn, sahl, subsequently, ren, descartes, showed, by, using, geometric, construction, and, the, law, of, refraction, also, known, as, descartes, law, that, the, angular, radius, of, a, rainbow, is, 42, i, e, the, angle, subtended, at, the, eye, by, the, edge, of, the, rainbow, and, the, rainbow, s, centre, is, 42, he, also, independently, discovered, the, law, of, reflection, and, his, essay, on, optics, was, the, first, published, mention, of, this, law, christiaan, huygens, wrote, several, works, in, the, area, of, optics, these, included, the, opera, reliqua, also, known, as, christiani, hugenii, zuilichemii, dum, viveret, zelhemii, toparchae, opuscula, posthuma, and, the, trait, de, la, lumi, re, newton, investigated, the, refraction, of, light, demonstrating, that, a, prism, could, decompose, white, light, into, a, spectrum, of, colours, and, that, a, lens, and, a, second, prism, could, recompose, the, multicoloured, spectrum, into, white, light, he, also, showed, that, the, coloured, light, does, not, change, its, properties, by, separating, out, a, coloured, beam, and, shining, it, on, various, objects, newton, noted, that, regardless, of, whether, it, was, reflected, or, scattered, or, transmitted, it, stayed, the, same, colour, thus, he, observed, that, colour, is, the, result, of, objects, interacting, with, already, coloured, light, rather, than, objects, generating, the, colour, themselves, this, is, known, as, newton, s, theory, of, colour, from, this, work, he, concluded, that, any, refracting, telescope, would, suffer, from, the, dispersion, of, light, into, colours, the, interest, of, the, royal, society, encouraged, him, to, publish, his, notes, on, colour, newton, argued, that, light, is, composed, of, particles, or, corpuscles, and, that, are, refracted, by, accelerating, toward, the, denser, medium, but, he, had, to, associate, them, with, waves, to, explain, the, diffraction, of, light, in, his, hypothesis, of, light, of, 1675, newton, posited, the, existence, of, the, ether, to, transmit, forces, between, particles, in, 1704, newton, published, opticks, in, which, he, expounded, his, corpuscular, theory, of, light, he, considered, light, to, be, made, up, of, extremely, subtle, corpuscles, that, ordinary, matter, was, made, of, grosser, corpuscles, and, speculated, that, through, a, kind, of, alchemical, transmutation, are, not, gross, bodies, and, light, convertible, into, one, another, and, may, not, bodies, receive, much, of, their, activity, from, the, particles, of, light, which, enter, their, composition, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, constructed, powerful, single, lens, microscopes, and, made, extensive, observations, that, he, published, around, 1660, paving, the, way, for, the, science, of, microbiology, william, gilbert, in, de, magnete, invented, the, neo, latin, word, electricus, from, elektron, the, greek, word, for, amber, gilbert, undertook, a, number, of, careful, electrical, experiments, in, the, course, of, which, he, discovered, that, many, substances, other, than, amber, such, as, sulphur, wax, glass, etc, were, capable, of, manifesting, electrical, properties, gilbert, discovered, that, a, heated, body, lost, its, electricity, and, that, moisture, prevented, the, electrification, of, all, bodies, he, noticed, that, electrified, substances, attracted, all, other, substances, indiscriminately, whereas, a, magnet, only, attracted, iron, the, many, discoveries, of, this, nature, earned, gilbert, the, title, founder, of, the, electrical, science, by, investigating, the, forces, on, a, light, metallic, needle, balanced, on, a, point, he, extended, the, list, of, electric, bodies, and, found, that, many, substances, including, metals, and, natural, magnets, showed, no, attractive, forces, when, rubbed, he, noticed, that, dry, weather, with, north, or, east, wind, was, the, most, favourable, atmospheric, condition, for, exhibiting, electric, phenomena, an, observation, liable, to, misconception, until, the, difference, between, conductor, and, insulator, was, understood, robert, boyle, worked, frequently, at, the, new, science, of, electricity, and, added, several, substances, to, gilbert, s, list, of, electrics, he, left, a, detailed, account, of, his, researches, under, the, title, of, experiments, on, the, origin, of, electricity, in, 1675, boyle, stated, that, electric, attraction, and, repulsion, can, act, across, a, vacuum, one, of, his, important, discoveries, was, that, electrified, bodies, in, a, vacuum, would, attract, light, substances, this, indicating, that, the, electrical, effect, did, not, depend, upon, the, air, as, a, medium, this, was, followed, in, 1660, by, otto, von, guericke, who, invented, an, early, electrostatic, generator, by, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, researchers, had, developed, practical, means, of, generating, electricity, by, friction, with, an, electrostatic, generator, but, the, development, of, electrostatic, machines, did, not, begin, in, earnest, until, the, 18th, century, when, they, became, fundamental, instruments, in, the, studies, about, the, science, of, electricity, the, first, usage, of, the, word, electricity, is, ascribed, to, thomas, browne, in, his, 1646, work, pseudodoxia, epidemica, in, 1729, stephen, gray, demonstrated, that, electricity, could, be, transmitted, through, metal, filaments, as, an, aid, to, scientific, investigation, various, tools, measuring, aids, and, calculating, devices, were, developed, in, this, period, john, napier, introduced, logarithms, as, a, powerful, mathematical, tool, with, the, help, of, henry, briggs, their, logarithmic, tables, embodied, a, computational, advance, that, made, calculations, by, hand, much, quicker, his, napier, s, bones, used, a, set, of, numbered, rods, as, a, multiplication, tool, using, the, system, of, lattice, multiplication, the, way, was, opened, to, later, scientific, advances, particularly, in, astronomy, and, dynamics, at, oxford, university, edmund, gunter, built, the, first, analog, device, to, aid, computation, the, gunter, s, scale, was, a, large, plane, scale, engraved, with, various, scales, or, lines, natural, lines, such, as, the, line, of, chords, the, line, of, sines, and, tangents, are, placed, on, one, side, of, the, scale, and, the, corresponding, artificial, or, logarithmic, ones, were, on, the, other, side, this, calculating, aid, was, a, predecessor, of, the, slide, rule, it, was, william, oughtred, who, first, used, two, such, scales, sliding, by, one, another, to, perform, direct, multiplication, and, division, and, thus, is, credited, as, the, inventor, of, the, slide, rule, in, 1622, blaise, pascal, invented, the, mechanical, calculator, in, 1642, the, introduction, of, his, pascaline, in, 1645, launched, the, development, of, mechanical, calculators, first, in, europe, and, then, all, over, the, world, gottfried, leibniz, building, on, pascal, s, work, became, one, of, the, most, prolific, inventors, in, the, field, of, mechanical, calculators, he, was, the, first, to, describe, a, pinwheel, calculator, in, 1685, and, he, invented, the, leibniz, wheel, used, in, the, arithmometer, the, first, mass, produced, mechanical, calculator, he, also, refined, the, binary, number, system, the, foundation, of, virtually, all, modern, computer, architectures, john, hadley, was, the, inventor, of, the, octant, the, precursor, to, the, sextant, invented, by, john, bird, which, greatly, improved, the, science, of, navigation, denis, papin, was, best, known, for, his, pioneering, invention, of, the, steam, digester, the, forerunner, of, the, steam, engine, the, first, working, steam, engine, was, patented, in, 1698, by, the, english, inventor, thomas, savery, as, a, new, invention, for, raising, of, water, and, occasioning, motion, to, all, sorts, of, mill, work, by, the, impellent, force, of, fire, which, will, be, of, great, use, and, advantage, for, drayning, mines, serveing, townes, with, water, and, for, the, working, of, all, sorts, of, mills, where, they, have, not, the, benefitt, of, water, nor, constant, windes, the, invention, was, demonstrated, to, the, royal, society, on, 14, june, 1699, and, the, machine, was, described, by, savery, in, his, book, the, miner, s, friend, or, an, engine, to, raise, water, by, fire, 1702, in, which, he, claimed, that, it, could, pump, water, out, of, mines, thomas, newcomen, perfected, the, practical, steam, engine, for, pumping, water, the, newcomen, steam, engine, consequently, newcomen, can, be, regarded, as, a, forefather, of, the, industrial, revolution, abraham, darby, i, was, the, first, and, most, famous, of, three, generations, of, the, darby, family, who, played, an, important, role, in, the, industrial, revolution, he, developed, a, method, of, producing, high, grade, iron, in, a, blast, furnace, fueled, by, coke, rather, than, charcoal, this, was, a, major, step, forward, in, the, production, of, iron, as, a, raw, material, for, the, industrial, revolution, refracting, telescopes, first, appeared, in, the, netherlands, in, 1608, apparently, the, product, of, spectacle, makers, experimenting, with, lenses, the, inventor, is, unknown, but, hans, lipperhey, applied, for, the, first, patent, followed, by, jacob, metius, of, alkmaar, galileo, was, one, of, the, first, scientists, to, use, this, tool, for, his, astronomical, observations, in, 1609, the, reflecting, telescope, was, described, by, james, gregory, in, his, book, optica, promota, 1663, he, argued, that, a, mirror, shaped, like, the, part, of, a, conic, section, would, correct, the, spherical, aberration, that, flawed, the, accuracy, of, refracting, telescopes, his, design, the, gregorian, telescope, however, remained, un, built, in, 1666, newton, argued, that, the, faults, of, the, refracting, telescope, were, fundamental, because, the, lens, refracted, light, of, different, colors, differently, he, concluded, that, light, could, not, be, refracted, through, a, lens, without, causing, chromatic, aberrations, from, these, experiments, newton, concluded, that, no, improvement, could, be, made, in, the, refracting, telescope, however, he, was, able, to, demonstrate, that, the, angle, of, reflection, remained, the, same, for, all, colors, so, he, decided, to, build, a, reflecting, telescope, it, was, completed, in, 1668, and, is, the, earliest, known, functional, reflecting, telescope, 50, years, later, hadley, developed, ways, to, make, precision, aspheric, and, parabolic, objective, mirrors, for, reflecting, telescopes, building, the, first, parabolic, newtonian, telescope, and, a, gregorian, telescope, with, accurately, shaped, mirrors, these, were, successfully, demonstrated, to, the, royal, society, the, invention, of, the, vacuum, pump, paved, the, way, for, the, experiments, of, robert, boyle, and, robert, hooke, into, the, nature, of, vacuum, and, atmospheric, pressure, the, first, such, device, was, made, by, otto, von, guericke, in, 1654, it, consisted, of, a, piston, and, an, air, gun, cylinder, with, flaps, that, could, suck, the, air, from, any, vessel, that, it, was, connected, to, in, 1657, he, pumped, the, air, out, of, two, conjoined, hemispheres, and, demonstrated, that, a, team, of, sixteen, horses, were, incapable, of, pulling, it, apart, the, air, pump, construction, was, greatly, improved, by, hooke, in, 1658, evangelista, torricelli, invented, the, mercury, barometer, in, 1643, the, motivation, for, the, invention, was, to, improve, on, the, suction, pumps, that, were, used, to, raise, water, out, of, the, mines, torricelli, constructed, a, sealed, tube, filled, with, mercury, set, vertically, into, a, basin, of, the, same, substance, the, column, of, mercury, fell, downwards, leaving, a, torricellian, vacuum, above, surviving, instruments, from, this, period, tend, to, be, made, of, durable, metals, such, as, brass, gold, or, steel, although, examples, such, as, telescopes, made, of, wood, pasteboard, or, with, leather, components, exist, those, instruments, that, exist, in, collections, today, tend, to, be, robust, examples, made, by, skilled, craftspeople, for, and, at, the, expense, of, wealthy, patrons, these, may, have, been, commissioned, as, displays, of, wealth, in, addition, the, instruments, preserved, in, collections, may, not, have, received, heavy, use, in, scientific, work, instruments, that, had, visibly, received, heavy, use, were, typically, destroyed, deemed, unfit, for, display, or, excluded, from, collections, altogether, it, is, also, postulated, that, the, scientific, instruments, preserved, in, many, collections, were, chosen, because, they, were, more, appealing, to, collectors, by, virtue, of, being, more, ornate, more, portable, or, made, with, higher, grade, materials, intact, air, pumps, are, particularly, rare, the, pump, at, right, included, a, glass, sphere, to, permit, demonstrations, inside, the, vacuum, chamber, a, common, use, the, base, was, wooden, and, the, cylindrical, pump, was, brass, other, vacuum, chambers, that, survived, were, made, of, brass, hemispheres, instrument, makers, of, the, late, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, were, commissioned, by, organizations, seeking, help, with, navigation, surveying, warfare, and, astronomical, observation, the, increase, in, uses, for, such, instruments, and, their, widespread, use, in, global, exploration, and, conflict, created, a, need, for, new, methods, of, manufacture, and, repair, which, would, be, met, by, the, industrial, revolution, the, idea, that, modern, science, took, place, as, a, kind, of, revolution, has, been, debated, among, historians, a, weakness, of, the, idea, of, a, scientific, revolution, is, the, lack, of, a, systematic, approach, to, the, question, of, knowledge, in, the, period, comprehended, between, the, 14th, and, 17th, centuries, leading, to, misunderstandings, on, the, value, and, role, of, modern, authors, from, this, standpoint, the, continuity, thesis, is, the, hypothesis, that, there, was, no, radical, discontinuity, between, the, intellectual, development, of, the, middle, ages, and, the, developments, in, the, renaissance, and, early, modern, period, and, has, been, deeply, and, widely, documented, by, the, works, of, scholars, like, pierre, duhem, john, hermann, randall, alistair, crombie, and, william, a, wallace, who, proved, the, preexistence, of, a, wide, range, of, ideas, used, by, the, followers, of, the, scientific, revolution, thesis, to, substantiate, their, claims, thus, the, idea, of, a, scientific, revolution, following, the, renaissance, is, according, to, the, continuity, thesis, a, myth, some, continuity, theorists, point, to, earlier, intellectual, revolutions, occurring, in, the, middle, ages, usually, referring, to, either, a, european, renaissance, of, the, 12th, century, or, a, medieval, muslim, scientific, revolution, as, a, sign, of, continuity, another, contrary, view, has, been, recently, proposed, by, arun, bala, in, his, dialogical, history, of, the, birth, of, modern, science, bala, proposes, that, the, changes, involved, in, the, scientific, revolution, the, mathematical, realist, turn, the, mechanical, philosophy, the, atomism, the, central, role, assigned, to, the, sun, in, copernican, heliocentrism, have, to, be, seen, as, rooted, in, multicultural, influences, on, europe, he, sees, specific, influences, in, alhazen, s, physical, optical, theory, chinese, mechanical, technologies, leading, to, the, perception, of, the, world, as, a, machine, the, hindu, arabic, numeral, system, which, carried, implicitly, a, new, mode, of, mathematical, atomic, thinking, and, the, heliocentrism, rooted, in, ancient, egyptian, religious, ideas, associated, with, hermeticism, bala, argues, that, by, ignoring, such, multicultural, impacts, we, have, been, led, to, a, eurocentric, conception, of, the, scientific, revolution, however, he, states, the, makers, of, the, revolution, copernicus, kepler, galileo, descartes, newton, and, many, others, had, to, selectively, appropriate, relevant, ideas, transform, them, and, create, new, auxiliary, concepts, in, order, to, complete, their, task, in, the, ultimate, analysis, even, if, the, revolution, was, rooted, upon, a, multicultural, base, it, is, the, accomplishment, of, europeans, in, europe, critics, note, that, lacking, documentary, evidence, of, transmission, of, specific, scientific, ideas, bala, s, model, will, remain, a, working, hypothesis, not, a, conclusion, a, third, approach, takes, the, term, renaissance, literally, as, a, rebirth, a, closer, study, of, greek, philosophy, and, greek, mathematics, demonstrates, that, nearly, all, of, the, so, called, revolutionary, results, of, the, so, called, scientific, revolution, were, in, actuality, restatements, of, ideas, that, were, in, many, cases, older, than, those, of, aristotle, and, in, nearly, all, cases, at, least, as, old, as, archimedes, aristotle, even, explicitly, argues, against, some, of, the, ideas, that, were, espoused, during, the, scientific, revolution, such, as, heliocentrism, the, basic, ideas, of, the, scientific, method, were, well, known, to, archimedes, and, his, contemporaries, as, demonstrated, in, the, discovery, of, buoyancy, this, approach, to, the, scientific, revolution, reduces, it, to, a, period, of, relearning, classical, ideas, that, is, very, much, an, extension, of, the, renaissance, this, view, does, not, deny, that, a, change, occurred, but, argues, that, it, was, a, reassertion, of, previous, knowledge, a, renaissance, and, not, the, creation, of, new, knowledge, it, cites, statements, from, newton, copernicus, and, others, in, favour, of, the, pythagorean, worldview, as, evidence, in, more, recent, analysis, of, the, scientific, revolution, during, this, period, there, has, been, criticism, of, the, dominance, of, male, scientists, of, the, time, female, scholars, were, not, given, the, opportunities, that, a, male, scholar, would, have, had, and, the, incorporation, of, women, s, work, in, the, sciences, during, this, time, tends, to, be, obscured, scholars, have, tried, to, look, into, the, participation, of, women, in, the, 17th, century, in, science, and, even, with, sciences, as, simple, as, domestic, knowledge, women, were, making, advances, with, the, limited, history, provided, from, texts, of, the, period, we, cannot, know, the, extent, of, women, s, roles, in, developing, the, scientific, ideas, and, inventions, another, idea, to, consider, is, the, way, this, period, influenced, even, the, women, scientists, of, the, periods, following, it, annie, jump, cannon, was, a, 20th, century, astronomer, who, benefitted, from, the, laws, and, theories, developed, from, this, period, she, made, several, advances, in, the, century, following, the, scientific, revolution, it, was, an, important, period, for, the, future, of, science, including, the, incorporation, of, women, into, fields, using, the, developments, made
