million, individuals, speak, more, than, twenty, eight, surviving, mayan, languages, and, reside, in, nearly, the, same, area, as, their, ancestors, the, archaic, period, before, 2000, bc, saw, the, first, developments, in, agriculture, and, the, earliest, villages, the, preclassic, period, c, 2000, bc, to, 250, ad, saw, the, establishment, of, the, first, complex, societies, in, the, maya, region, and, the, cultivation, of, the, staple, crops, of, the, maya, diet, including, maize, beans, squashes, and, chili, peppers, the, first, maya, cities, developed, around, 750, bc, and, by, 500,

beginning, around, 250, ad, the, classic, period, is, largely, defined, as, when, the, maya, were, raising, sculpted, monuments, with, long, count, dates, this, period, saw, the, maya, civilization, develop, many, city, states, linked, by, a, complex, trade, network, in, the, maya, lowlands, two, great, rivals, the, cities, of, tikal, and, calakmul, became, powerful, the, classic, period, also, saw, the, intrusive, intervention, of, the, central, mexican, city, of, teotihuacan, in, maya, dynastic, politics, in, the, 9th, century, there, was, a, widespread, political, collapse, in, the, central, maya, region, resulting, in, civil, wars, the, abandonment, of, cities, and, a, northward, shift, of, population, the, postclassic, period, saw, the, rise, of, chichen, itza, in, the, north, and, the, expansion, of, the, aggressive, k, iche, kingdom, in, the, guatemalan, highlands, in, the, 16th, century, the, spanish, empire, colonised, the, mesoamerican, region, and, a, lengthy, series,

rest, having, been, destroyed, by, the, spanish, in, addition, a, great, many, examples, of, maya, texts, can, be, found, on, stelae, and, ceramics, the, maya, developed, a, highly, complex, series, of, interlocking, ritual, calendars, and, employed, mathematics, that, included, one, of, the, earliest, known, instances, of, the, explicit, zero, in, human, history, as, a, part, of, their, religion, the, maya, practised, human, sacrifice, maya, is, a, modern, term, used, to, refer, collectively, to, the, various, peoples, that, inhabited, this, area, as, maya, peoples, have, not, had, a, sense, of, a, common, ethnic, identity, or, political, unity, for, the, vast, majority, of, their, history, early, spanish, and, mayan, language, colonial, sources, in, the, yucat, n, peninsula, used, the, term, maya, to, denote, both, the, language, spoken, by, the, yucatec, maya, and, the, area, surrounding, the, then, abandoned, city, of, mayap, n, from, which, the, term, derived, some, colonial, mayan, language, sources, also, used, maya, to, refer, to, other, maya, groups, sometimes, pejoratively, in, reference, to, maya, groups, more, resistant, to, spanish, rule, the, maya, civilization, occupied, a, wide, territory, that, included, southeastern, mexico, and, northern, central, america, this, area, included, the, entire, yucat, n, peninsula, and, all, of, the, territory, now, in, the, modern, countries, of, guatemala, and, belize, as, well, as, the, western, portions, of, honduras, and, el, salvador, most, of, the, peninsula, is, formed, by, a, vast, plain, with, few, hills, or, mountains, and, a, generally, low, coastline, the, territory, of, the, maya, covered, a, third, of, mesoamerica, and, the, maya, were, engaged, in, a, dynamic, relationship, with, neighbouring, cultures, that, included, the, olmecs, mixtecs, teotihuacan, and, aztecs, during, the, early, classic, period, the, maya, cities, of, tikal, and, kaminaljuyu, were, key, maya, foci, in, a, network, that, extended, into, the, highlands, of, central, mexico, there, was, a, strong, maya, presence, at, the, tetitla, compound, of, teotihuacan, the, maya, city, of, chichen, itza, and, the,

highlands, extend, eastwards, from, chiapas, into, guatemala, reaching, their, highest, in, the, sierra, de, los, cuchumatanes, their, major, pre, columbian, population, centres, were, in, the, largest, highland, valleys, such, as, the, valley, of, guatemala, and, the, quetzaltenango, valley, in, the, southern, highlands, a, belt, of, volcanic, cones, runs, parallel, to, the, pacific, coast, the, highlands, extend, northwards, into, verapaz, and, gradually, descend, to, the, east, the, history, of, maya, civilization, is, divided, into, three, principal, periods, the, preclassic, classic, and, postclassic, these, were, preceded, by, the, archaic, period, during, which, the, first, settled, villages, and, early, developments, in, agriculture, emerged, modern, scholars, regard, these, periods, as, arbitrary, divisions, of, maya, chronology, rather, than, indicative, of, cultural, evolution, or, decline, definitions, of, the, start, and, end, dates, of, period, spans, can, vary, by, as, much, as, a, century, depending, on, the, author, the, maya, developed, their, first, civilization, in, the, preclassic, period, scholars, continue, to, discuss, when, this, era, of, maya, civilization, began, maya, occupation, at, cuello, modern, belize, has, been, carbon, dated, to, around, 2600, bc, settlements, were, established, around, 1800, bc, in, the, soconusco, region, of, the, pacific, coast, and, the, maya, were, already, cultivating, the, staple, crops, of, maize, beans, squash, and, chili, pepper, this, period, was, characterised, by, sedentary, communities, and, the, introduction, of, pottery, and, fired, clay, figurines, during, the, middle, preclassic, period, small, villages, began, to, grow, to, form, cities, nakbe, in, the, pet, n, department, of, guatemala, is, the, earliest, well, documented, city, in, the, maya, lowlands, where, large, structures, have, been, dated, to, around, 750, bc, the, northern, lowlands, of, yucat, n, were, widely, settled, by, the, middle, preclassic, by, approximately, 400, bc, early, maya, rulers, were, raising, stelae, a, developed, script, was, already, being, used, in, pet, n, by, the, 3rd, century, bc, in, the, late, preclassic, period, the, enormous, city, of, el, mirador, grew, to, cover, approximately, 16, square, kilometres, 6, 2, sq, mi, although, not, as, large, tikal, was, already, a, significant, city, by, around, 350, bc, in, the, highlands, kaminaljuyu, emerged, as, a, principal, centre, in, the, late, preclassic, takalik, abaj, and, chocol, were, two, of, the, most, important, cities, on, the, pacific, coastal, plain, and, komchen, grew, to, become, an, important, site, in, northern, yucat, n, the, late, preclassic, cultural, florescence, collapsed, in, the, 1st, century, ad, and, many, of, the, great, maya, cities, of, the, epoch, were, abandoned, the, cause, of, this, collapse, is, unknown, the, classic, period, is, largely, defined, as, the, period, during, which, the, lowland, maya, raised, dated, monuments, using, the, long, count, calendar, this, period, marked, the, peak, of, large, scale, construction, and, urbanism, the, recording, of, monumental, inscriptions, and, demonstrated, significant, intellectual, and, artistic, development, particularly, in, the, southern, lowland, regions, the, classic, period, maya, political, landscape, has, been, likened, to, that, of, renaissance, italy, or, classical, greece, with, multiple, city, states, engaged, in, a, complex, network, of, alliances, and, enmities, the, largest, cities, had, 50, 000, to, 120, 000, people, and, were, linked, to, networks, of, subsidiary, sites, during, the, early, classic, cities, throughout, the, maya, region, were, influenced, by, the, great, metropolis, of, teotihuacan, in, the, distant, valley, of, mexico, in, ad, 378, teotihuacan, decisively, intervened, at, tikal, and, other, nearby, cities, deposed, their, rulers, and, installed, a, new, teotihuacan, backed, dynasty, this, intervention, was, led, by, siyaj, k, ak, born, of, fire, who, arrived, at, tikal, in, early, 378, the, king, of, tikal, chak, tok, ich, aak, i, died, on, the, same, day, suggesting, a, violent, takeover, a, year, later, siyaj, k, ak, oversaw, the, installation, of, a, new, king, yax, nuun, ahiin, i, this, led, to, a, period, of, political, dominance, when, tikal, became, the, most, powerful, city, in, the, central, lowlands, tikal, s, great, rival, was, calakmul, another, powerful, city, in, the, pet, n, basin, tikal, and, calakmul, both, developed, extensive, systems, of, allies, and, vassals, lesser, cities, that, entered, one, of, these, networks, gained, prestige, from, their, association, with, the, top, tier, city, and, maintained, peaceful, relations, with, members, of, the, network, tikal, and, calakmul, engaged, in, the, manoeuvering, of, their, alliance, networks, against, each, other, at, various, points, during, the, classic, period, one, or, other, of, these, powers, would, gain, a, strategic, victory, over, its, great, rival, resulting, in, respective, periods, of, florescence, and, decline, in, 629, b, alaj, chan, k, awiil, a, son, of, the, tikal, king, k, inich, muwaan, jol, ii, was, sent, to, found, a, new, city, at, dos, pilas, in, the, petexbat, n, region, apparently, as, an, outpost, to, extend, tikal, s, power, beyond, the, reach, of, calakmul, for, the, next, two, decades, he, fought, loyally, for, his, brother, and, overlord, at, tikal, in, 648, king, yuknoom, ch, een, ii, of, calakmul, captured, balaj, chan, k, awiil, yuknoom, ch, een, ii, then, reinstated, balaj, chan, k, awiil, upon, the, throne, of, dos, pilas, as, his, vassal, he, thereafter, served, as, a, loyal, ally, of, calakmul, in, the, southeast, cop, n, was, the, most, important, city, its, classic, period, dynasty, was, founded, in, 426, by, k, inich, yax, k, uk, mo, the, new, king, had, strong, ties, with, central, pet, n, and, teotihuacan, cop, n, reached, the, height, of, its, cultural, and, artistic, development, during, the, rule, of, uaxaclajuun, ub, aah, k, awiil, who, ruled, from, 695, to, 738, his, reign, ended, catastrophically, when, he, was, captured, by, his, vassal, king, k, ak, tiliw, chan, yopaat, of, quirigu, the, captured, lord, of, cop, n, was, taken, back, to, quirigu, and, was, decapitated, in, a, public, ritual, it, is, likely, that, this, coup, was, backed, by, calakmul, in, order, to, weaken, a, powerful, ally, of, tikal, palenque, and, yaxchilan, were, the, most, powerful, cities, in, the, usumacinta, region, in, the, highlands, kaminaljuyu, in, the, valley, of, guatemala, was, already, a, sprawling, city, by, 300, in, the, north, of, the, maya, area, coba, was, the, most, important, capital, during, the, 9th, century, ad, the, central, maya, region, suffered, major, political, collapse, marked, by, the, abandonment, of, cities, the, ending, of, dynasties, and, a, northward, shift, in, activity, no, universally, accepted, theory, explains, this, collapse, but, it, likely, had, a, combination, of, causes, including, endemic, internecine, warfare, overpopulation, resulting, in, severe, environmental, degradation, and, drought, during, this, period, known, as, the, terminal, classic, the, northern, cities, of, chichen, itza, and, uxmal, showed, increased, activity, major, cities, in, the, northern, yucat, n, peninsula, were, inhabited, long, after, the, cities, of, the, southern, lowlands, ceased, to, raise, monuments, classic, maya, social, organization, was, based, on, the, ritual, authority, of, the, ruler, rather, than, central, control, of, trade, and, food, distribution, this, model, was, poorly, structured, to, respond, to, changes, because, the, ruler, s, actions, were, limited, by, tradition, to, such, activities, as, construction, ritual, and, warfare, this, only, served, to, exacerbate, systemic, problems, by, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, this, resulted, in, collapse, of, this, system, of, rulership, in, the, northern, yucat, n, individual, rule, was, replaced, by, a, ruling, council, formed, from, elite, lineages, in, the, southern, yucat, n, and, central, pet, n, kingdoms, declined, in, western, pet, n, and, some, other, areas, the, changes, were, catastrophic, and, resulted, in, the, rapid, depopulation, of, cities, within, a, couple, of, generations, large, swathes, of, the, central, maya, area, were, all, but, abandoned, both, the, capitals, and, their, secondary, centres, were, generally, abandoned, within, a, period, of, 50, to, 100, years, one, by, one, cities, stopped, sculpting, dated, monuments, the, last, long, count, date, was, inscribed, at, tonin, in, 909, stelae, were, no, longer, raised, and, squatters, moved, into, abandoned, royal, palaces, mesoamerican, trade, routes, shifted, and, bypassed, pet, n, although, much, reduced, a, significant, maya, presence, remained, into, the, postclassic, period, after, the, abandonment, of, the, major, classic, period, cities, the, population, was, particularly, concentrated, near, permanent, water, sources, unlike, during, previous, cycles, of, contraction, abandoned, lands, were, not, quickly, resettled, in, the, postclassic, activity, shifted, to, the, northern, lowlands, and, the, maya, highlands, this, may, have, involved, migration, from, the, southern, lowlands, because, many, postclassic, maya, groups, had, migration, myths, chichen, itza, and, its, puuc, neighbours, declined, dramatically, in, the, 11th, century, and, this, may, represent, the, final, episode, of, classic, period, collapse, after, the, decline, of, chichen, itza, the, maya, region, lacked, a, dominant, power, until, the, rise, of, the, city, of, mayapan, in, the, 12th, century, new, cities, arose, near, the, caribbean, and, gulf, coasts, and, new, trade, networks, were, formed, the, postclassic, period, was, marked, by, changes, from, the, preceding, classic, period, the, once, great, city, of, kaminaljuyu, in, the, valley, of, guatemala, was, abandoned, after, continuous, occupation, of, almost, 2, 000, years, across, the, highlands, and, neighbouring, pacific, coast, long, occupied, cities, in, exposed, locations, were, relocated, apparently, due, to, a, proliferation, of, warfare, cities, came, to, occupy, more, easily, defended, hilltop, locations, surrounded, by, deep, ravines, with, ditch, and, wall, defences, sometimes, supplementing, the, natural, terrain, one, of, the, most, important, cities, in, the, guatemalan, highlands, at, this, time, was, q, umarkaj, the, capital, of, the, aggressive, k, iche, kingdom, the, government, of, maya, states, from, the, yucat, n, to, the, guatemalan, highlands, was, often, organised, as, joint, rule, by, a, council, however, in, practice, one, member, of, the, council, could, act, as, a, supreme, ruler, while, the, other, members, served, him, as, advisors, mayapan, was, abandoned, around, 1448, after, a, period, of, political, social, and, environmental, turbulence, that, in, many, ways, echoed, the, classic, period, collapse, in, the, southern, maya, region, the, abandonment, of, the, city, was, followed, by, a, period, of, prolonged, warfare, disease, and, natural, disasters, in, the, yucat, n, peninsula, which, ended, only, shortly, before, spanish, contact, in, 1511, even, without, a, dominant, regional, capital, the, early, spanish, explorers, reported, wealthy, coastal, cities, and, thriving, marketplaces, during, the, late, postclassic, the, yucat, n, peninsula, was, divided, into, a, number, of, independent, provinces, that, shared, a, common, culture, but, varied, in, internal, sociopolitical, organization, on, the, eve, of, the, spanish, conquest, the, highlands, of, guatemala, were, dominated, by, several, powerful, maya, states, the, k, iche, had, carved, out, a, small, empire, covering, a, large, part, of, the, western, guatemalan, highlands, and, the, neighbouring, pacific, coastal, plain, however, in, the, decades, before, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, kaqchikel, kingdom, had, been, steadily, eroding, the, kingdom, of, the, k, iche, in, 1511, a, spanish, caravel, was, wrecked, in, the, caribbean, and, about, a, dozen, survivors, made, landfall, on, the, coast, of, yucat, n, they, were, seized, by, a, maya, lord, and, most, were, sacrificed, although, two, escaped, from, 1517, to, 1519, three, separate, spanish, expeditions, explored, the, yucat, n, coast, and, engaged, in, a, number, of, battles, with, the, maya, inhabitants, after, the, aztec, capital, tenochtitlan, fell, to, the, spanish, in, 1521, hern, n, cort, s, despatched, pedro, de, alvarado, to, guatemala, with, 180, cavalry, 300, infantry, 4, cannons, and, thousands, of, allied, warriors, from, central, mexico, they, arrived, in, soconusco, in, 1523, the, k, iche, capital, q, umarkaj, fell, to, alvarado, in, 1524, shortly, afterwards, the, spanish, were, invited, as, allies, into, iximche, the, capital, city, of, the, kaqchikel, maya, good, relations, did, not, last, due, to, excessive, spanish, demands, for, gold, as, tribute, and, the, city, was, abandoned, a, few, months, later, this, was, followed, by, the, fall, of, zaculeu, the, mam, maya, capital, in, 1525, francisco, de, montejo, and, his, son, francisco, de, montejo, the, younger, launched, a, long, series, of, campaigns, against, the, polities, of, the, yucat, n, peninsula, in, 1527, and, finally, completed, the, conquest, of, the, northern, portion, of, the, peninsula, in, 1546, this, left, only, the, maya, kingdoms, of, the, pet, n, basin, independent, in, 1697, mart, n, de, urs, a, launched, an, assault, on, the, itza, capital, nojpet, n, and, the, last, independent, maya, city, fell, to, the, spanish, the, spanish, conquest, stripped, away, most, of, the, defining, features, of, maya, civilization, however, many, maya, villages, remained, remote, from, spanish, colonial, authority, and, for, the, most, part, continued, to, manage, their, own, affairs, maya, communities, and, the, nuclear, family, maintained, their, traditional, day, to, day, life, the, basic, mesoamerican, diet, of, maize, and, beans, continued, although, agricultural, output, was, improved, by, the, introduction, of, steel, tools, traditional, crafts, such, as, weaving, ceramics, and, basketry, continued, to, be, practised, community, markets, and, trade, in, local, products, continued, long, after, the, conquest, at, times, the, colonial, administration, encouraged, the, traditional, economy, in, order, to, extract, tribute, in, the, form, of, ceramics, or, cotton, textiles, although, these, were, usually, made, to, european, specifications, maya, beliefs, and, language, proved, resistant, to, change, despite, vigorous, efforts, by, catholic, missionaries, the, 260, day, tzolk, in, ritual, calendar, continues, in, use, in, modern, maya, communities, in, the, highlands, of, guatemala, and, chiapas, and, millions, of, mayan, language, speakers, inhabit, the, territory, in, which, their, ancestors, developed, their, civilization, the, agents, of, the, catholic, church, wrote, detailed, accounts, of, the, maya, in, support, of, their, efforts, at, christianization, and, absorption, of, the, maya, into, the, spanish, empire, this, was, followed, by, various, spanish, priests, and, colonial, officials, who, left, descriptions, of, ruins, they, visited, in, yucat, n, and, central, america, in, 1839, american, traveller, and, writer, john, lloyd, stephens, set, out, to, visit, a, number, of, maya, sites, with, english, architect, and, draftsman, frederick, catherwood, their, illustrated, accounts, of, the, ruins, sparked, strong, popular, interest, and, brought, the, maya, to, world, attention, the, later, 19th, century, saw, the, recording, and, recovery, of, ethnohistoric, accounts, of, the, maya, and, the, first, steps, in, deciphering, maya, hieroglyphs, the, final, two, decades, of, the, 19th, century, saw, the, birth, of, modern, scientific, archaeology, in, the, maya, region, with, the, meticulous, work, of, alfred, maudslay, and, teoberto, maler, by, the, early, 20th, century, the, peabody, museum, was, sponsoring, excavations, at, cop, n, and, in, the, yucat, n, peninsula, in, the, first, two, decades, of, the, 20th, century, advances, were, made, in, deciphering, the, maya, calendar, and, identifying, deities, dates, and, religious, concepts, since, the, 1930s, archaeological, exploration, increased, dramatically, with, large, scale, excavations, across, the, maya, region, in, the, 1960s, mayanist, j, eric, s, thompson, promoted, the, ideas, that, maya, cities, were, essentially, vacant, ceremonial, centres, serving, a, dispersed, population, in, the, forest, and, that, the, maya, civilization, was, governed, by, peaceful, astronomer, priests, these, ideas, began, to, collapse, with, major, advances, in, the, decipherment, of, the, script, in, the, late, 20th, century, pioneered, by, heinrich, berlin, tatiana, proskouriakoff, and, yuri, knorozov, with, breakthroughs, in, understanding, of, maya, script, since, the, 1950s, the, texts, revealed, the, warlike, activities, of, the, classic, maya, kings, undermining, the, view, of, the, maya, as, peaceful, unlike, the, aztecs, and, the, inca, the, maya, political, system, never, integrated, the, entire, maya, cultural, area, into, a, single, state, or, empire, rather, throughout, its, history, the, maya, area, contained, a, varying, mix, of, political, complexity, that, included, both, states, and, chiefdoms, these, polities, fluctuated, greatly, in, their, relationships, with, each, other, and, were, engaged, in, a, complex, web, of, rivalries, periods, of, dominance, or, submission, vassalage, and, alliances, at, times, different, polities, achieved, regional, dominance, such, as, calakmul, caracol, mayapan, and, tikal, the, first, reliably, evidenced, polities, formed, in, the, maya, lowlands, in, the, 9th, century, bc, during, the, late, preclassic, the, maya, political, system, coalesced, into, a, theopolitical, form, where, elite, ideology, justified, the, ruler, s, authority, and, was, reinforced, by, public, display, ritual, and, religion, the, divine, king, was, the, centre, of, political, power, exercising, ultimate, control, over, administrative, economic, judicial, and, military, functions, the, divine, authority, invested, within, the, ruler, was, such, that, the, king, was, able, to, mobilize, both, the, aristocracy, and, commoners, in, executing, huge, infrastructure, projects, apparently, with, no, police, force, or, standing, army, some, polities, engaged, in, a, strategy, of, increasing, administration, and, filling, administrative, posts, with, loyal, supporters, rather, than, blood, relatives, within, a, polity, mid, ranking, population, centres, would, have, played, a, key, role, in, managing, resources, and, internal, conflict, the, maya, political, landscape, was, highly, complex, and, maya, elites, engaged, in, political, intrigue, to, gain, economic, and, social, advantage, over, neighbours, in, the, late, classic, some, cities, established, a, long, period, of, dominance, over, other, large, cities, such, as, the, dominance, of, caracol, over, naranjo, for, half, a, century, in, other, cases, loose, alliance, networks, were, formed, around, a, dominant, city, border, settlements, usually, located, about, halfway, between, neighbouring, capitals, often, switched, allegiance, over, the, course, of, their, history, and, at, times, acted, independently, dominant, capitals, exacted, tribute, in, the, form, of, luxury, items, from, subjugated, population, centres, political, power, was, reinforced, by, military, power, and, the, capture, and, humiliation, of, enemy, warriors, played, an, important, part, in, elite, culture, an, overriding, sense, of, pride, and, honour, among, the, warrior, aristocracy, could, lead, to, extended, feuds, and, vendettas, which, caused, political, instability, and, the, fragmentation, of, polities, from, the, early, preclassic, maya, society, was, sharply, divided, between, the, elite, and, commoners, as, population, increased, over, time, various, sectors, of, society, became, increasingly, specialised, and, political, organization, increasingly, complex, by, the, late, classic, when, populations, had, grown, enormously, and, hundreds, of, cities, were, connected, in, a, complex, web, of, political, hierarchies, the, wealthy, segment, of, society, multiplied, a, middle, class, may, have, developed, that, included, artisans, low, ranking, priests, and, officials, merchants, and, soldiers, commoners, included, farmers, servants, labourers, and, slaves, according, to, indigenous, histories, land, was, held, communally, by, noble, houses, or, clans, such, clans, held, that, the, land, was, the, property, of, the, ancestors, and, ties, between, the, land, and, the, ancestors, were, reinforced, by, the, burial, of, the, dead, within, residential, compounds, classic, maya, rule, was, centred, in, a, royal, culture, that, was, displayed, in, all, areas, of, classic, maya, art, the, king, was, the, supreme, ruler, and, held, a, semi, divine, status, that, made, him, the, mediator, between, the, mortal, realm, and, that, of, the, gods, from, very, early, times, kings, were, specifically, identified, with, the, young, maize, god, whose, gift, of, maize, was, the, basis, of, mesoamerican, civilization, maya, royal, succession, was, patrilineal, and, royal, power, only, passed, to, queens, when, doing, otherwise, would, result, in, the, extinction, of, the, dynasty, typically, power, was, passed, to, the, eldest, son, a, young, prince, was, called, a, ch, ok, youth, although, this, word, later, came, to, refer, to, nobility, in, general, the, royal, heir, was, called, b, aah, ch, ok, head, youth, various, points, in, the, prince, s, childhood, were, marked, by, ritual, the, most, important, was, a, bloodletting, ceremony, at, age, five, or, six, although, being, of, the, royal, bloodline, was, of, utmost, importance, the, heir, also, had, to, be, a, successful, war, leader, as, demonstrated, by, taking, of, captives, the, enthronement, of, a, new, king, was, a, highly, elaborate, ceremony, involving, a, series, of, separate, acts, that, included, enthronement, upon, a, jaguar, skin, cushion, human, sacrifice, and, receiving, the, symbols, of, royal, power, such, as, a, headband, bearing, a, jade, representation, of, the, so, called, jester, god, an, elaborate, headdress, adorned, with, quetzal, feathers, and, a, sceptre, representing, the, god, k, awiil, maya, political, administration, based, around, the, royal, court, was, not, bureaucratic, in, nature, government, was, hierarchical, and, official, posts, were, sponsored, by, higher, ranking, members, of, the, aristocracy, officials, tended, to, be, promoted, to, higher, levels, of, office, over, their, lives, officials, are, referred, to, as, being, owned, by, their, sponsor, and, this, relationship, continued, even, after, the, death, of, the, sponsor, the, maya, royal, court, was, a, vibrant, and, dynamic, political, institution, there, was, no, universal, structure, for, the, maya, royal, court, instead, each, polity, formed, a, royal, court, that, was, suited, to, its, own, individual, context, a, number, of, royal, and, noble, titles, have, been, identified, by, epigraphers, translating, classic, maya, inscriptions, ajaw, is, usually, translated, as, lord, or, king, in, the, early, classic, an, ajaw, was, the, ruler, of, a, city, later, with, increasing, social, complexity, the, ajaw, was, a, member, of, the, ruling, class, and, a, major, city, could, have, more, than, one, each, ruling, over, different, districts, paramount, rulers, distinguished, themselves, from, the, extended, nobility, by, prefixing, the, word, k, uhul, to, their, ajaw, title, a, k, uhul, ajaw, was, divine, lord, originally, confined, to, the, kings, of, the, most, prestigious, and, ancient, royal, lines, kalomte, was, a, royal, title, whose, exact, meaning, is, not, yet, deciphered, but, it, was, held, only, by, the, most, powerful, kings, of, the, strongest, dynasties, it, indicated, an, overlord, or, high, king, and, was, only, in, use, during, the, classic, period, by, the, late, classic, the, absolute, power, of, the, k, uhul, ajaw, had, weakened, and, the, political, system, had, diversified, to, include, a, wider, aristocracy, that, by, this, time, may, well, have, expanded, disproportionately, a, sajal, was, ranked, below, the, ajaw, and, indicated, a, subservient, lord, a, sajal, would, be, lord, of, a, second, or, third, tier, site, answering, to, an, ajaw, who, may, himself, have, been, subservient, to, a, kalomte, a, sajal, would, often, be, a, war, captain, or, regional, governor, and, inscriptions, often, link, the, sajal, title, to, warfare, they, are, often, mentioned, as, the, holders, of, war, captives, sajal, meant, feared, one, the, titles, of, ah, tz, ihb, and, ah, ch, ul, hun, are, both, related, to, scribes, the, ah, tz, ihb, was, a, royal, scribe, usually, a, member, of, the, royal, family, the, ah, ch, ul, hun, was, the, keeper, of, the, holy, books, a, title, that, is, closely, associated, with, the, ajaw, title, indicating, that, an, ajaw, always, held, the, ah, ch, ul, hun, title, simultaneously, other, courtly, titles, the, functions, of, which, are, not, well, understood, were, yajaw, k, ahk, lord, of, fire, ti, huun, and, ti, sakhuun, these, last, two, may, be, variations, on, the, same, title, and, mark, zender, has, suggested, that, the, holder, of, this, title, may, have, been, the, spokesman, for, the, ruler, courtly, titles, are, overwhelmingly, male, oriented, and, in, those, relatively, rare, occasions, where, they, are, applied, to, a, woman, they, appear, to, be, used, as, honorifics, for, female, royalty, titled, elites, were, often, associated, with, particular, structures, in, the, hieroglyphic, inscriptions, of, classic, period, cities, indicating, that, such, office, holders, either, owned, that, structure, or, that, the, structure, was, an, important, focus, for, their, activities, a, lakam, or, standard, bearer, was, possibly, the, only, non, elite, post, holder, in, the, royal, court, the, lakam, was, only, found, in, larger, sites, and, they, appear, to, have, been, responsible, for, the, taxation, of, local, districts, different, factions, may, have, existed, in, the, royal, court, the, k, uhul, ahaw, and, his, household, would, have, formed, the, central, power, base, but, other, important, groups, were, the, priesthood, the, warrior, aristocracy, and, other, aristocratic, courtiers, where, ruling, councils, existed, as, at, chichen, itza, and, cop, n, these, may, have, formed, an, additional, faction, rivalry, between, different, factions, would, have, led, to, dynamic, political, institutions, as, compromises, and, disagreements, were, played, out, in, such, a, setting, public, performance, was, vital, such, performances, included, ritual, dances, presentation, of, war, captives, offerings, of, tribute, human, sacrifice, and, religious, ritual, commoners, are, estimated, to, have, comprised, over, 90, of, the, population, but, relatively, little, is, known, about, them, their, houses, were, generally, constructed, from, perishable, materials, and, their, remains, have, left, little, trace, in, the, archaeological, record, some, commoner, dwellings, were, raised, on, low, platforms, and, these, can, be, identified, but, an, unknown, quantity, of, commoner, houses, were, not, such, low, status, dwellings, can, only, be, detected, by, extensive, remote, sensing, surveys, of, apparently, empty, terrain, the, range, of, commoners, was, broad, it, consisted, of, everyone, not, of, noble, birth, and, therefore, included, everyone, from, the, poorest, farmers, to, wealthy, craftsmen, and, commoners, appointed, to, bureaucratic, positions, commoners, engaged, in, essential, production, activities, including, that, of, products, destined, for, use, by, the, elite, such, as, cotton, and, cacao, as, well, as, subsistence, crops, for, their, own, use, and, utilitarian, items, such, as, ceramics, and, stone, tools, commoners, took, part, in, warfare, and, could, advance, socially, by, proving, themselves, as, outstanding, warriors, commoners, paid, taxes, to, the, elite, in, the, form, of, staple, goods, such, as, maize, flour, and, game, it, is, likely, that, hard, working, commoners, who, displayed, exceptional, skills, and, initiative, could, become, influential, members, of, maya, society, warfare, was, prevalent, in, the, maya, world, military, campaigns, were, launched, for, a, variety, of, reasons, including, the, control, of, trade, routes, and, tribute, raids, to, take, captives, scaling, up, to, the, complete, destruction, of, an, enemy, state, little, is, known, about, maya, military, organization, logistics, or, training, warfare, is, depicted, in, maya, art, from, the, classic, period, and, wars, and, victories, are, mentioned, in, hieroglyphic, inscriptions, unfortunately, the, inscriptions, do, not, provide, information, upon, the, causes, of, war, or, the, form, it, took, in, the, 8th, 9th, centuries, intensive, warfare, resulted, in, the, collapse, of, the, kingdoms, of, the, petexbat, n, region, of, western, pet, n, the, rapid, abandonment, of, aguateca, by, its, inhabitants, has, provided, a, rare, opportunity, to, examine, the, remains, of, maya, weaponry, in, situ, aguateca, was, stormed, by, unknown, enemies, around, 810, ad, who, overcame, its, formidable, defences, and, burned, the, royal, palace, the, elite, inhabitants, of, the, city, either, fled, or, were, captured, and, never, returned, to, collect, their, abandoned, property, the, inhabitants, of, the, periphery, abandoned, the, site, soon, after, this, is, an, example, of, intensive, warfare, carried, out, by, an, enemy, in, order, to, eliminate, a, maya, state, rather, than, subjugate, it, research, at, aguateca, indicated, that, classic, period, warriors, were, primarily, members, of, the, elite, from, as, early, as, the, preclassic, period, the, ruler, of, a, maya, polity, was, expected, to, be, a, distinguished, war, leader, and, was, depicted, with, trophy, heads, hanging, from, his, belt, in, the, classic, period, such, trophy, heads, no, longer, appeared, on, the, king, s, belt, but, classic, period, kings, are, frequently, depicted, standing, over, humiliated, war, captives, right, up, to, the, end, of, the, postclassic, period, maya, kings, led, as, war, captains, maya, inscriptions, from, the, classic, show, that, a, defeated, king, could, be, captured, tortured, and, sacrificed, the, spanish, recorded, that, maya, leaders, kept, track, of, troop, movements, in, painted, books, the, outcome, of, a, successful, military, campaign, could, vary, in, its, impact, on, the, defeated, polity, in, some, cases, entire, cities, were, sacked, and, never, resettled, as, at, aguateca, in, other, instances, the, victors, would, seize, the, defeated, rulers, their, families, and, patron, gods, the, captured, nobles, and, their, families, could, be, imprisoned, or, sacrificed, at, the, least, severe, end, of, the, scale, the, defeated, polity, would, be, obliged, to, pay, tribute, to, the, victor, during, the, contact, period, certain, military, positions, were, held, by, members, of, the, aristocracy, and, were, passed, on, by, patrilineal, succession, it, is, likely, that, the, specialised, knowledge, inherent, in, the, particular, military, role, was, taught, to, the, successor, including, strategy, ritual, and, war, dances, maya, armies, of, the, contact, period, were, highly, disciplined, and, warriors, participated, in, regular, training, exercises, and, drills, every, able, bodied, adult, male, was, available, for, military, service, maya, states, did, not, maintain, standing, armies, warriors, were, mustered, by, local, officials, who, reported, back, to, appointed, warleaders, there, were, also, units, of, full, time, mercenaries, who, followed, permanent, leaders, most, warriors, were, not, full, time, however, and, were, primarily, farmers, the, needs, of, their, crops, usually, came, before, warfare, maya, warfare, was, not, so, much, aimed, at, destruction, of, the, enemy, as, the, seizure, of, captives, and, plunder, there, is, some, evidence, from, the, classic, period, that, women, provided, supporting, roles, in, war, but, they, did, not, act, as, military, officers, with, the, exception, of, those, rare, ruling, queens, by, the, postclassic, the, native, chronicles, suggest, that, women, occasionally, fought, in, battle, the, atlatl, spear, thrower, was, introduced, to, the, maya, region, by, teotihuacan, in, the, early, classic, this, was, a, 0, 5, metre, long, 1, 6, ft, stick, with, a, notched, end, to, hold, a, dart, or, javelin, the, stick, was, used, to, launch, the, missile, with, more, force, and, accuracy, than, simply, hurling, it, with, the, arm, evidence, in, the, form, of, stone, blade, points, recovered, from, aguateca, indicate, that, darts, and, spears, were, the, primary, weapons, of, the, classic, maya, warrior, commoners, used, blowguns, in, war, which, also, served, as, their, hunting, weapon, the, bow, and, arrow, was, used, by, the, ancient, maya, for, both, war, and, hunting, although, present, in, the, maya, region, during, the, classic, period, its, use, as, a, weapon, of, war, was, not, favoured, it, did, not, become, a, common, weapon, until, the, postclassic, the, contact, period, maya, also, used, two, handed, swords, crafted, from, strong, wood, with, the, blade, fashioned, from, inset, obsidian, similar, to, the, aztec, macuahuitl, maya, warriors, wore, body, armour, in, the, form, of, quilted, cotton, that, had, been, soaked, in, salt, water, to, toughen, it, the, resulting, armour, compared, favourably, to, the, steel, armour, worn, by, the, spanish, when, they, conquered, the, region, warriors, bore, wooden, or, animal, hide, shields, decorated, with, feathers, and, animal, skins, trade, was, a, key, component, of, maya, society, and, in, the, development, of, the, maya, civilization, the, cities, that, grew, to, become, the, most, important, usually, controlled, access, to, vital, trade, goods, or, portage, routes, cities, such, as, kaminaljuyu, and, q, umarkaj, in, the, guatemalan, highlands, and, chalchuapa, in, el, salvador, variously, controlled, access, to, the, sources, of, obsidian, at, different, points, in, maya, history, the, maya, were, major, producers, of, cotton, which, was, used, to, make, the, textiles, to, be, traded, throughout, mesoamerica, the, most, important, cities, in, the, northern, yucat, n, peninsula, controlled, access, to, the, sources, of, salt, in, the, postclassic, the, maya, engaged, in, a, flourishing, slave, trade, with, wider, mesoamerica, the, maya, engaged, in, long, distance, trade, across, the, maya, region, and, across, greater, mesoamerica, and, beyond, as, an, illustration, an, early, classic, maya, merchant, quarter, has, been, identified, at, the, distant, metropolis, of, teotihuacan, in, central, mexico, within, mesoamerica, beyond, the, maya, area, trade, routes, particularly, focused, on, central, mexico, and, the, gulf, coast, in, the, early, classic, chichen, itza, was, at, the, hub, of, an, extensive, trade, network, that, imported, gold, discs, from, colombia, and, panama, and, turquoise, from, los, cerrillos, new, mexico, long, distance, trade, of, both, luxury, and, utilitarian, goods, was, probably, controlled, by, the, royal, family, prestige, goods, obtained, by, trade, were, used, both, for, consumption, by, the, city, s, ruler, and, as, luxury, gifts, to, consolidate, the, loyalty, of, vassals, and, allies, trade, routes, not, only, supplied, physical, goods, they, facilitated, the, movement, of, people, and, ideas, throughout, mesoamerica, shifts, in, trade, routes, occurred, with, the, rise, and, fall, of, important, cities, in, the, maya, region, and, have, been, identified, in, every, major, reorganization, of, the, maya, civilization, such, as, the, rise, of, preclassic, maya, civilization, the, transition, to, the, classic, and, the, terminal, classic, collapse, even, the, spanish, conquest, did, not, immediately, terminate, all, maya, trading, activity, for, example, the, contact, period, manche, ch, ol, traded, the, prestige, crops, of, cacao, annatto, and, vanilla, into, colonial, verapaz, little, is, known, of, maya, merchants, although, they, are, depicted, on, maya, ceramics, in, elaborate, noble, dress, so, at, least, some, were, members, of, the, elite, during, the, contact, period, maya, nobility, took, part, in, long, distance, trading, expeditions, the, majority, of, traders, were, middle, class, but, were, largely, engaged, in, local, and, regional, trade, rather, than, the, prestigious, long, distance, trading, that, was, the, preserve, of, the, elite, the, travelling, of, merchants, into, dangerous, foreign, territory, was, likened, to, a, passage, through, the, underworld, the, patron, deities, of, merchants, were, two, underworld, gods, carrying, backpacks, when, merchants, travelled, they, painted, themselves, black, like, their, patron, gods, and, went, heavily, armed, the, maya, had, no, pack, animals, so, all, trade, goods, were, carried, on, the, backs, of, porters, when, going, overland, if, the, trade, route, followed, a, river, or, the, coast, then, goods, were, transported, in, canoes, a, substantial, maya, trading, canoe, made, from, a, large, hollowed, out, tree, trunk, was, encountered, off, honduras, on, christopher, columbus, s, fourth, voyage, the, canoe, was, 2, 5, metres, 8, 2, ft, broad, and, was, powered, by, 25, rowers, trade, goods, carried, included, cacao, obsidian, ceramics, textiles, and, copper, bells, and, axes, cacao, was, used, as, currency, although, not, exclusively, and, its, value, was, such, that, counterfeiting, occurred, by, removing, the, flesh, from, the, pod, and, stuffing, it, with, dirt, or, avocado, rind, marketplaces, are, difficult, to, identify, archaeologically, however, the, spanish, reported, a, thriving, market, economy, when, they, arrived, in, the, region, at, some, classic, period, cities, archaeologists, have, tentatively, identified, formal, arcade, style, masonry, architecture, and, parallel, alignments, of, scattered, stones, as, the, permanent, foundations, of, market, stalls, a, 2007, study, compared, soils, from, a, modern, guatemalan, market, to, a, proposed, ancient, market, at, chunchucmil, unusually, high, levels, of, zinc, and, phosphorus, at, both, sites, indicated, similar, food, production, and, vegetable, sales, activity, the, calculated, density, of, market, stalls, at, chunchucmil, strongly, suggests, that, a, thriving, market, economy, already, existed, in, the, early, classic, archaeologists, have, tentatively, identified, marketplaces, at, an, increasing, number, of, maya, cities, by, means, of, a, combination, of, archaeology, and, soil, analysis, when, the, spanish, arrived, postclassic, cities, in, the, highlands, had, markets, in, permanent, plazas, with, officials, on, hand, to, settle, disputes, enforce, rules, and, collect, taxes, maya, art, is, essentially, the, art, of, the, royal, court, it, is, almost, exclusively, concerned, with, the, maya, elite, and, their, world, maya, art, was, crafted, from, both, perishable, and, non, perishable, materials, and, served, to, link, the, maya, to, their, ancestors, although, surviving, maya, art, represents, only, a, small, proportion, of, the, art, that, the, maya, created, it, represents, a, wider, variety, of, subjects, than, any, other, art, tradition, in, the, americas, maya, art, has, many, regional, styles, and, is, unique, in, the, ancient, americas, in, bearing, narrative, text, the, finest, surviving, maya, art, dates, to, the, late, classic, period, the, maya, exhibited, a, preference, for, the, colour, green, or, blue, green, and, used, the, same, word, for, the, colours, blue, and, green, correspondingly, they, placed, high, value, on, apple, green, jade, and, other, greenstones, associating, them, with, the, sun, god, k, inich, ajau, they, sculpted, artefacts, that, included, fine, tesserae, and, beads, to, carved, heads, weighing, 4, 42, kilograms, 9, 7, lb, the, maya, nobility, practised, dental, modification, and, some, lords, wore, encrusted, jade, in, their, teeth, mosaic, funerary, masks, could, also, be, fashioned, from, jade, such, as, that, of, k, inich, janaab, pakal, king, of, palenque, maya, stone, sculpture, emerged, into, the, archaeological, record, as, a, fully, developed, tradition, suggesting, that, it, may, have, evolved, from, a, tradition, of, sculpting, wood, because, of, the, biodegradability, of, wood, the, corpus, of, maya, woodwork, has, almost, entirely, disappeared, the, few, wooden, artefacts, that, have, survived, include, three, dimensional, sculptures, and, hieroglyphic, panels, stone, maya, stelae, are, widespread, in, city, sites, often, paired, with, low, circular, stones, referred, to, as, altars, in, the, literature, stone, sculpture, also, took, other, forms, such, as, the, limestone, relief, panels, at, palenque, and, piedras, negras, at, yaxchilan, dos, pilas, cop, n, and, other, sites, stone, stairways, were, decorated, with, sculpture, the, hieroglyphic, stairway, at, cop, n, comprises, the, longest, surviving, maya, hieroglyphic, text, and, consists, of, 2, 200, individual, glyphs, the, largest, maya, sculptures, consisted, of, architectural, fa, ades, crafted, from, stucco, the, rough, form, was, laid, out, on, a, plain, plaster, base, coating, on, the, wall, and, the, three, dimensional, form, was, built, up, using, small, stones, finally, this, was, coated, with, stucco, and, moulded, into, the, finished, form, human, body, forms, were, first, modelled, in, stucco, with, their, costumes, added, afterwards, the, final, stucco, sculpture, was, then, brightly, painted, giant, stucco, masks, were, used, to, adorn, temple, fa, ades, by, the, late, preclassic, and, such, decoration, continued, into, the, classic, period, the, maya, had, a, long, tradition, of, mural, painting, rich, polychrome, murals, have, been, excavated, at, san, bartolo, dating, to, between, 300, and, 200, bc, walls, were, coated, with, plaster, and, polychrome, designs, were, painted, onto, the, smooth, finish, the, majority, of, such, murals, have, not, survived, but, early, classic, tombs, painted, in, cream, red, and, black, have, been, excavated, at, caracol, r, o, azul, and, tikal, among, the, best, preserved, murals, are, a, full, size, series, of, late, classic, paintings, at, bonampak, flint, chert, and, obsidian, all, served, utilitarian, purposes, in, maya, culture, but, many, pieces, were, finely, crafted, into, forms, that, were, never, intended, to, be, used, as, tools, eccentric, flints, are, among, the, finest, lithic, artefacts, produced, by, the, ancient, maya, they, were, technically, very, challenging, to, produce, requiring, considerable, skill, on, the, part, of, the, artisan, large, obsidian, eccentrics, can, measure, over, 30, centimetres, 12, in, in, length, their, actual, form, varies, considerably, but, they, generally, depict, human, animal, and, geometric, forms, associated, with, maya, religion, eccentric, flints, show, a, great, variety, of, forms, such, as, crescents, crosses, snakes, and, scorpions, the, largest, and, most, elaborate, examples, display, multiple, human, heads, with, minor, heads, sometimes, branching, off, from, larger, one, maya, textiles, are, very, poorly, represented, in, the, archaeological, record, although, by, comparison, with, other, pre, columbian, cultures, such, as, the, aztecs, and, the, andean, region, it, is, likely, that, they, were, high, value, items, scraps, of, textile, have, been, recovered, but, the, best, evidence, for, textile, art, is, where, they, are, represented, in, other, media, such, as, painted, murals, or, ceramics, such, secondary, representations, show, the, elite, of, the, maya, court, adorned, with, sumptuous, cloths, generally, these, would, have, been, cotton, but, jaguar, pelts, and, deer, hides, are, also, shown, ceramics, are, the, most, commonly,

haphazardly, with, drawings, overlapping, each, other, and, display, a, mix, of, crude, untrained, art, and, examples, by, artists, familiar, with, classic, period, artistic, conventions, the, maya, produced, a, vast, array, of, structures, and, have, left, an, extensive, architectural, legacy, maya, architecture, also, incorporates, various, art, forms, and, hieroglyphic, texts, masonry, architecture, built, by, the, maya, evidences, craft, specialization, in, maya, society, centralised, organization, and, the, political, means, to, mobilize, a, large, workforce, it, is, estimated, that, a, large, elite, residence, at, cop, n, required, an, estimated, 10, 686, man, days, to, build, which, compares, to, 67, man, days, for, a, commoner, s, hut, it, is, further, estimated, that, 65, of, the, labour, required, to, build, the, noble, residence, was, used, in, the, quarrying, transporting, and, finishing, of, the, stone, used, in, construction, and, 24, of, the, labour, was, required, for, the, manufacture, and, application, of, limestone, based, plaster, altogether, it, is, estimated, that, two, to, three, months, were, required, for, the, construction, of, the, residence, for, this, single, noble, at, cop, n, using, between, 80, and, 130, full, time, labourers, a, classic, period, city, like, tikal, was, spread, over, 20, square, kilometres, 7, 7, sq, mi, with, an, urban, core, covering, 6, square, kilometres, 2, 3, sq, mi, the, labour, required, to, build, such, a, city, was, immense, running, into, many, millions, of, man, days, the, most, massive, structures, ever, erected, by, the, maya, were, built, during, the, preclassic, period, craft, specialization, would, have, required, dedicated, stonemasons, and, plasterers, by, the, late, preclassic, and, would, have, required, planners, and, architects, maya, cities, were, not, formally, planned, and, were, subject, to, irregular, expansion, with, the, haphazard, addition, of, palaces, temples, and, other, buildings, most, maya, cities, tended, to, grow, outwards, from, the, core, and, upwards, as, new, structures, were, superimposed, upon, preceding, architecture, maya, cities, usually, had, a, ceremonial, and, administrative, centre, surrounded, by, a, vast, irregular, sprawl, of, residential, complexes, the, centres, of, all, maya, cities, featured, sacred, precincts, sometimes, separated, from, nearby, residential, areas, by, walls, these, precincts, contained, pyramid, temples, and, other, monumental, architecture, dedicated, to, elite, activities, such, as, basal, platforms, that, supported, administrative, or, elite, residential, complexes, sculpted, monuments, were, raised, to, record, the, deeds, of, the, ruling, dynasty, city, centres, also, featured, plazas, sacred, ballcourts, and, buildings, used, for, marketplaces, and, schools, frequently, causeways, linked, the, centre, to, outlying, areas, of, the, city, some, of, these, classes, of, architecture, formed, lesser, groups, in, the, outlying, areas, of, the, city, which, served, as, sacred, centres, for, non, royal, lineages, the, areas, adjacent, to, these, sacred, compounds, included, residential, complexes, housing, wealthy, lineages, the, largest, and, richest, of, these, elite, compounds, sometimes, possessed, sculpture, and, art, of, craftsmanship, equal, to, that, of, royal, art, the, ceremonial, centre, of, the, maya, city, was, where, the, ruling, elite, lived, and, where, the, administrative, functions, of, the, city, were, performed, together, with, religious, ceremonies, it, was, also, where, the, inhabitants, of, the, city, gathered, for, public, activities, elite, residential, complexes, occupied, the, best, land, around, the, city, centre, while, commoners, had, their, residences, dispersed, further, away, from, the, ceremonial, centre, residential, units, were, built, on, top, of, stone, platforms, to, raise, them, above, the, level, of, the, rain, season, floodwaters, the, maya, built, their, cities, with, neolithic, technology, they, built, their, structures, from, both, perishable, materials, and, from, stone, the, exact, type, of, stone, used, in, masonry, construction, varied, according, to, locally, available, resources, and, this, also, affected, the, building, style, across, a, broad, swathe, of, the, maya, area, limestone, was, immediately, available, the, local, limestone, is, relatively, soft, when, freshly, cut, but, hardens, with, exposure, there, was, great, variety, in, the, quality, of, limestone, with, good, quality, stone, available, in, the, usumacinta, region, in, the, northern, yucat, n, the, limestone, used, in, construction, was, of, relatively, poor, quality, volcanic, tuff, was, used, at, cop, n, and, nearby, quirigu, employed, sandstone, in, comalcalco, where, suitable, stone, was, not, available, locally, fired, bricks, were, employed, limestone, was, burned, at, high, temperatures, in, order, to, manufacture, cement, plaster, and, stucco, lime, based, cement, was, used, to, seal, stonework, in, place, and, stone, blocks, were, fashioned, using, rope, and, water, abrasion, and, with, obsidian, tools, the, maya, did, not, employ, a, functional, wheel, so, all, loads, were, transported, on, litters, barges, or, rolled, on, logs, heavy, loads, were, lifted, with, rope, but, probably, without, employing, pulleys, wood, was, used, for, beams, and, for, lintels, even, in, masonry, structures, throughout, maya, history, common, huts, and, some, temples, continued, to, be, built, from, wooden, poles, and, thatch, adobe, was, also, applied, this, consisted, of, mud, strengthened, with, straw, and, was, applied, as, a, coating, over, the, woven, stick, walls, of, huts, even, after, the, development, of, masonry, structures, in, the, southern, maya, area, adobe, was, employed, in, monumental, architecture, when, no, suitable, stone, was, locally, available, the, great, cities, of, the, maya, civilization, were, composed, of, pyramid, temples, palaces, ballcourts, sacbeob, causeways, patios, and, plazas, some, cities, also, possessed, extensive, hydraulic, systems, or, defensive, walls, the, exteriors, of, most, buildings, were, painted, either, in, one, or, multiple, colours, or, with, imagery, many, buildings, were, adorned, with, sculpture, or, painted, stucco, reliefs, these, complexes, were, usually, located, in, the, site, core, beside, a, principal, plaza, maya, palaces, consisted, of, a, platform, supporting, a, multiroom, range, structure, the, term, acropolis, in, a, maya, context, refers, to, a, complex, of, structures, built, upon, platforms, of, varying, height, palaces, and, acropoleis, were, essentially, elite, residential, compounds, they, generally, extended, horizontally, as, opposed, to, the, towering, maya, pyramids, and, often, had, restricted, access, some, structures, in, maya, acropoleis, supported, roof, combs, rooms, often, had, stone, benches, for, sleeping, and, holes, indicate, where, curtains, once, hung, large, palaces, such, as, at, palenque, could, be, fitted, with, a, water, supply, and, sweat, baths, were, often, found, within, the, complex, or, nearby, during, the, early, classic, rulers, were, sometimes, buried, underneath, the, acropolis, complex, some, rooms, in, palaces, were, true, throne, rooms, in, the, royal, palace, of, palenque, there, were, a, number, of, throne, rooms, that, were, used, for, important, events, including, the, inauguration, of, new, kings, palaces, are, usually, arranged, around, one, or, more, courtyards, with, their, fa, ades, facing, inwards, some, examples, are, adorned, with, sculpture, some, palaces, possess, associated, hieroglyphic, descriptions, that, identify, them, as, the, royal, residences, of, named, rulers, there, is, abundant, evidence, that, palaces, were, far, more, than, simple, elite, residences, and, that, a, range, of, courtly, activities, took, place, in, them, including, audiences, formal, receptions, and, important, rituals, temples, were, sometimes, referred, to, in, hieroglyphic, texts, as, k, uh, nah, meaning, god, s, house, temples, were, raised, on, platforms, most, often, upon, a, pyramid, the, earliest, temples, were, probably, thatched, huts, built, upon, low, platforms, by, the, late, preclassic, period, their, walls, were, of, stone, and, the, development, of, the, corbel, arch, allowed, stone, roofs, to, replace, thatch, by, the, classic, period, temple, roofs, were, being, topped, with, roof, combs, that, extended, the, height, of, the, temple, and, served, as, a, foundation, for, monumental, art, temple, shrines, contained, one, to, three, rooms, and, were, dedicated, to, important, deities, such, a, deity, might, be, one, of, the, patron, gods, of, the, city, or, a, deified, ancestor, in, general, freestanding, pyramids, were, shrines, honouring, powerful, ancestors, the, maya, were, keen, observers, of, the, sun, stars, and, planets, e, groups, were, a, particular, arrangement, of, temples, that, were, relatively, common, in, the, maya, region, they, take, their, names, from, group, e, at, uaxactun, they, consisted, of, three, small, structures, facing, a, fourth, structure, and, were, used, to, mark, the, solstices, and, equinoxes, the, earliest, examples, date, to, the, preclassic, period, the, lost, world, complex, at, tikal, started, out, as, an, e, group, built, towards, the, end, of, the, middle, preclassic, due, to, its, nature, the, basic, layout, of, an, e, group, was, constant, a, structure, was, built, on, the, west, side, of, a, plaza, it, was, usually, a, radial, pyramid, with, stairways, facing, the, cardinal, directions, it, faced, east, across, the, plaza, to, three, small, temples, on, the, far, side, from, the, west, pyramid, the, sun, was, seen, to, rise, over, these, temples, on, the, solstices, and, equinoxes, e, groups, were, raised, across, the, central, and, southern, maya, area, for, over, a, millennium, not, all, were, properly, aligned, as, observatories, and, their, function, may, have, been, symbolic, as, well, as, e, groups, the, maya, built, other, structures, dedicated, to, observing, the, movements, of, celestial, bodies, many, maya, buildings, were, aligned, with, astronomical, bodies, including, the, planet, venus, and, various, constellations, the, caracol, structure, at, chichen, itza, was, a, circular, multi, level, edifice, with, a, conical, superstructure, it, has, slit, windows, that, marked, the, movements, of, venus, at, cop, n, a, pair, of, stelae, were, raised, to, mark, the, position, of, the, setting, sun, at, the, equinoxes, triadic, pyramids, first, appeared, in, the, preclassic, they, consisted, of, a, dominant, structure, flanked, by, two, smaller, inward, facing, buildings, all, mounted, upon, a, single, basal, platform, the, largest, known, triadic, pyramid, was, built, at, el, mirador, in, the, pet, n, basin, it, covers, an, area, six, times, as, large, as, that, covered, by, temple, iv, the, largest, pyramid, at, tikal, the, three, superstructures, all, have, stairways, leading, up, from, the, central, plaza, on, top, of, the, basal, platform, no, securely, established, forerunners, of, triadic, groups, are, known, but, they, may, have, developed, from, the, eastern, range, building, of, e, group, complexes, the, triadic, form, was, the, predominant, architectural, form, in, the, pet, n, region, during, the, late, preclassic, examples, of, triadic, pyramids, are, known, from, as, many, as, 88, archaeological, sites, at, nakbe, there, are, at, least, a, dozen, examples, of, triadic, complexes, and, the, four, largest, structures, in, the, city, are, triadic, in, nature, at, el, mirador, there, are, probably, as, many, as, 36, triadic, structures, examples, of, the, triadic, form, are, even, known, from, dzibilchaltun, in, the, far, north, of, the, yucat, n, peninsula, and, q, umarkaj, in, the, highlands, of, guatemala, the, triadic, pyramid, remained, a, popular, architectural, form, for, centuries, after, the, first, examples, were, built, it, continued, in, use, into, the, classic, period, with, later, examples, being, found, at, uaxactun, caracol, seibal, nakum, tikal, and, palenque, the, q, umarkaj, example, is, the, only, one, that, has, been, dated, to, the, postclassic, period, the, triple, temple, form, of, the, triadic, pyramid, appears, to, be, related, to, maya, mythology, the, ballcourt, is, a, distinctive, pan, mesoamerican, form, of, architecture, although, the, majority, of, maya, ballcourts, date, to, the, classic, period, the, earliest, examples, appeared, around, 1000, bc, in, northwestern, yucat, n, during, the, middle, preclassic, by, the, time, of, spanish, contact, ballcourts, were, only, in, use, in, the, guatemalan, highlands, at, cities, such, as, q, umarkaj, and, iximche, throughout, maya, history, ballcourts, maintained, a, characteristic, form, consisting, of, an, shape, with, a, central, playing, area, terminating, in, two, transverse, end, zones, the, central, playing, area, usually, measures, between, 20, and, 30, metres, 66, and, 98, ft, long, and, is, flanked, by, two, lateral, structures, that, stood, up, to, 3, or, 4, metres, 9, 8, or, 13, 1, ft, high, the, lateral, platforms, often, supported, structures, that, may, have, held, privileged, spectators, the, great, ballcourt, at, chichen, itza, is, the, largest, in, mesoamerica, measuring, 83, metres, 272, ft, long, by, 30, metres, 98, ft, wide, with, walls, standing, 8, 2, metres, 27, ft, high, although, maya, cities, shared, many, common, features, there, was, considerable, variation, in, architectural, style, such, styles, were, influenced, by, locally, available, construction, materials, climate, topography, and, local, preferences, in, the, late, classic, these, local, differences, developed, into, distinctive, regional, architectural, styles, the, central, pet, n, style, of, architecture, is, modelled, after, the, great, city, of, tikal, the, style, is, characterised, by, tall, pyramids, supporting, a, summit, shrine, adorned, with, a, roof, comb, and, accessed, by, a, single, doorway, additional, features, are, the, use, of, stela, altar, pairings, and, the, decoration, of, architectural, fa, ades, lintels, and, roof, combs, with, relief, sculptures, of, rulers, and, gods, one, of, the, finest, examples, of, central, pet, n, style, architecture, is, tikal, temple, i, examples, of, sites, in, the, central, pet, n, style, include, altun, ha, calakmul, holmul, ixkun, nakum, naranjo, and, yaxh, the, exemplar, of, puuc, style, architecture, is, uxmal, the, style, developed, in, the, puuc, hills, of, northwestern, yucat, n, during, the, terminal, classic, it, spread, beyond, this, core, region, across, the, northern, yucat, n, peninsula, puuc, sites, replaced, rubble, cores, with, lime, cement, resulting, in, stronger, walls, and, also, strengthened, their, corbel, arches, this, allowed, puuc, style, cities, to, build, freestanding, entrance, archways, the, upper, fa, ades, of, buildings, were, decorated, with, precut, stones, mosaic, fashion, erected, as, facing, over, the, core, forming, elaborate, compositions, of, long, nosed, deities, such, as, the, rain, god, chaac, and, the, principal, bird, deity, the, motifs, also, included, geometric, patterns, lattices, and, spools, possibly, influenced, by, styles, from, highland, oaxaca, outside, the, maya, area, in, contrast, the, lower, fa, ades, were, left, undecorated, roof, combs, were, relatively, uncommon, at, puuc, sites, the, chenes, style, is, very, similar, to, the, puuc, style, but, predates, the, use, of, the, mosaic, fa, ades, of, the, puuc, region, it, featured, fully, adorned, fa, ades, on, both, the, upper, and, lower, sections, of, structures, some, doorways, were, surrounded, by, mosaic, masks, of, monsters, representing, mountain, or, sky, deities, identifying, the, doorways, as, entrances, to, the, supernatural, realm, some, buildings, contained, interior, stairways, that, accessed, different, levels, the, chenes, style, is, most, commonly, encountered, in, the, southern, portion, of, the, yucat, n, peninsula, although, individual, buildings, in, the, style, can, be, found, elsewhere, in, the, peninsula, examples, of, chenes, sites, include, dzibilnocac, hochob, santa, rosa, xtampak, and, tabasque, o, the, r, o, bec, style, forms, a, sub, region, of, the, chenes, style, and, also, features, elements, of, the, central, pet, n, style, such, as, prominent, roof, combs, its, palaces, are, distinctive, for, their, false, tower, decorations, lacking, interior, rooms, with, steep, almost, vertical, stairways, and, false, doors, these, towers, were, adorned, with, deity, masks, and, were, built, to, impress, the, viewer, rather, than, serve, any, practical, function, such, false, towers, are, only, found, in, the, r, o, bec, region, r, o, bec, sites, include, chicann, hormiguero, and, xpuhil, the, usumacinta, style, developed, in, the, hilly, terrain, of, the, usumacinta, drainage, cities, took, advantage, of, the, hillsides, to, support, their, major, architecture, as, at, palenque, and, yaxchilan, sites, modified, corbel, vaulting, to, allow, thinner, walls, and, multiple, access, doors, to, temples, as, in, pet, n, roof, combs, adorned, principal, structures, palaces, had, multiple, entrances, that, used, post, and, lintel, entrances, rather, than, corbel, vaulting, many, sites, erected, stelae, but, palenque, instead, developed, finely, sculpted, panelling, to, decorate, its, buildings, before, 2000, bc, the, maya, spoke, a, single, language, dubbed, proto, mayan, by, linguists, linguistic, analysis, of, reconstructed, proto, mayan, vocabulary, suggests, that, the, original, proto, mayan, homeland, was, in, the, western, or, northern, guatemalan, highlands, although, the, evidence, is, not, conclusive, proto, mayan, diverged, during, the, preclassic, period, to, form, the, major, mayan, language, groups, that, make, up, the, family, including, huastecan, greater, k, iche, an, greater, q, anjobalan, mamean, tz, eltalan, ch, olan, and, yucatecan, these, groups, diverged, further, during, the, pre, columbian, era, to, form, over, 30, languages, that, have, survived, into, modern, times, the, language, of, almost, all, classic, maya, texts, over, the, entire, maya, area, has, been, identified, as, ch, olan, late, preclassic, text, from, kaminaljuyu, in, the, highlands, also, appears, to, be, in, or, related, to, ch, olan, the, use, of, ch, olan, as, the, language, of, maya, text, does, not, necessarily, indicate, that, it, was, the, language, commonly, used, by, the, local, populace, it, may, have, been, equivalent, to, medieval, latin, as, a, ritual, or, prestige, language, classic, ch, olan, may, have, been, the, prestige, language, of, the, classic, maya, elite, used, in, inter, polity, communication, such, as, diplomacy, and, trade, by, the, postclassic, period, yucatec, was, also, being, written, in, maya, codices, alongside, ch, olan, the, maya, writing, system, is, one, of, the, outstanding, achievements, of, the, pre, columbian, inhabitants, of, the, americas, it, was, the, most, sophisticated, and, highly, developed, writing, system, of, more, than, a, dozen, systems, that, developed, in, mesoamerica, the, earliest, inscriptions, in, an, identifiably, maya, script, date, back, to, 300, 200, bc, in, the, pet, n, basin, however, this, is, preceded, by, several, other, mesoamerican, writing, systems, such, as, the, epi, olmec, and, zapotec, scripts, early, maya, script, had, appeared, on, the, pacific, coast, of, guatemala, by, the, late, 1st, century, ad, or, early, 2nd, century, similarities, between, the, isthmian, script, and, early, maya, script, of, the, pacific, coast, suggest, that, the, two, systems, developed, in, tandem, by, about, ad, 250, the, maya, script, had, become, a, more, formalised, and, consistent, writing, system, the, catholic, church, and, colonial, officials, notably, bishop, diego, de, landa, destroyed, maya, texts, wherever, they, found, them, and, with, them, the, knowledge, of, maya, writing, but, by, chance, four, uncontested, pre, columbian, books, dated, to, the, postclassic, period, have, been, preserved, these, are, known, as, the, madrid, codex, the, dresden, codex, the, paris, codex, and, the, maya, codex, of, mexico, previously, known, as, the, grolier, codex, which, was, of, disputed, authenticity, until, 2018, archaeology, conducted, at, maya, sites, often, reveals, other, fragments, rectangular, lumps, of, plaster, and, paint, chips, which, were, codices, these, tantalizing, remains, are, however, too, severely, damaged, for, any, inscriptions, to, have, survived, most, of, the, organic, material, having, decayed, in, reference, to, the, few, extant, maya, writings, michael, d, coe, stated, ur, knowledge, of, ancient, maya, thought, must, represent, only, a, tiny, fraction, of, the, whole, picture, for, of, the, thousands, of, books, in, which, the, full, extent, of, their, learning, and, ritual, was, recorded, only, four, have, survived, to, modern, times, as, though, all, that, posterity, knew, of, ourselves, were, to, be, based, upon, three, prayer, books, and, pilgrim, s, progress, most, surviving, pre, columbian, maya, writing, dates, to, the, classic, period, and, is, contained, in, stone, inscriptions, from, maya, sites, such, as, stelae, or, on, ceramics, vessels, other, media, include, the, aforementioned, codices, stucco, fa, ades, frescoes, wooden, lintels, cave, walls, and, portable, artefacts, crafted, from, a, variety, of, materials, including, bone, shell, obsidian, and, jade, the, maya, writing, system, often, called, hieroglyphs, from, a, superficial, resemblance, to, ancient, egyptian, writing, is, a, logosyllabic, writing, system, combining, a, syllabary, of, phonetic, signs, representing, syllables, with, logogram, representing, entire, words, among, the, writing, systems, of, the, pre, columbian, new, world, maya, script, most, closely, represents, the, spoken, language, at, any, one, time, no, more, than, around, 500, glyphs, were, in, use, some, 200, of, which, including, variations, were, phonetic, the, maya, script, was, in, use, up, to, the, arrival, of, the, europeans, its, use, peaking, during, the, classic, period, in, excess, of, 10, 000, individual, texts, have, been, recovered, mostly, inscribed, on, stone, monuments, lintels, stelae, and, ceramics, the, maya, also, produced, texts, painted, on, a, form, of, paper, manufactured, from, processed, tree, bark, generally, now, known, by, its, nahuatl, language, name, amatl, used, to, produce, codices, the, skill, and, knowledge, of, maya, writing, persisted, among, segments, of, the, population, right, up, to, the, spanish, conquest, the, knowledge, was, subsequently, lost, as, a, result, of, the, impact, of, the, conquest, on, maya, society, the, decipherment, and, recovery, of, the, knowledge, of, maya, writing, has, been, a, long, and, laborious, process, some, elements, were, first, deciphered, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, mostly, the, parts, having, to, do, with, numbers, the, maya, calendar, and, astronomy, major, breakthroughs, were, made, from, the, 1950s, to, 1970s, and, accelerated, rapidly, thereafter, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, scholars, were, able, to, read, the, majority, of, maya, texts, and, ongoing, work, continues, to, further, illuminate, the, content, the, basic, unit, of, maya, logosyllabic, text, is, the, glyph, block, which, transcribes, a, word, or, phrase, the, block, is, composed, of, one, or, more, individual, glyphs, attached, to, each, other, to, form, the, glyph, block, with, individual, glyph, blocks, generally, being, separated, by, a, space, glyph, blocks, are, usually, arranged, in, a, grid, pattern, for, ease, of, reference, epigraphers, refer, to, glyph, blocks, from, left, to, right, alphabetically, and, top, to, bottom, numerically, thus, any, glyph, block, in, a, piece, of, text, can, be, identified, c4, would, be, third, block, counting, from, the, left, and, the, fourth, block, counting, downwards, if, a, monument, or, artefact, has, more, than, one, inscription, column, labels, are, not, repeated, rather, they, continue, in, the, alphabetic, series, if, there, are, more, than, 26, columns, the, labelling, continues, as, a, b, etc, numeric, row, labels, restart, from, 1, for, each, discrete, unit, of, text, although, mayan, text, may, be, laid, out, in, varying, manners, generally, it, is, arranged, into, double, columns, of, glyph, blocks, the, reading, order, of, text, starts, at, the, top, left, block, a1, continues, to, the, second, block, in, the, double, column, b1, then, drops, down, a, row, and, starts, again, from, the, left, half, of, the, double, column, a2, and, thus, continues, in, zig, zag, fashion, once, the, bottom, is, reached, the, inscription, continues, from, the, top, left, of, the, next, double, column, c1, where, an, inscription, ends, in, a, single, unpaired, column, this, final, column, is, usually, read, straight, downwards, individual, glyph, blocks, may, be, composed, of, a, number, of, elements, these, consist, of, the, main, sign, and, any, affixes, main, signs, represent, the, major, element, of, the, block, and, may, be, a, noun, verb, adverb, adjective, or, phonetic, sign, some, main, signs, are, abstract, some, are, pictures, of, the, object, they, represent, and, others, are, head, variants, personifications, of, the, word, they, represent, affixes, are, smaller, rectangular, elements, usually, attached, to, a, main, sign, although, a, block, may, be, composed, entirely, of, affixes, affixes, may, represent, a, wide, variety, of, speech, elements, including, nouns, verbs, verbal, suffixes, prepositions, and, pronouns, small, sections, of, a, main, sign, could, be, used, to, represent, the, whole, main, sign, maya, scribes, were, highly, inventive, in, their, usage, and, adaptation, of, glyph, elements, although, the, archaeological, record, does, not, provide, examples, of, brushes, or, pens, analysis, of, ink, strokes, on, the, postclassic, codices, suggests, that, it, was, applied, with, a, brush, with, a, tip, fashioned, from, pliable, hair, a, classic, period, sculpture, from, cop, n, honduras, depicts, a, scribe, with, an, inkpot, fashioned, from, a, conch, shell, excavations, at, aguateca, uncovered, a, number, of, scribal, artefacts, from, the, residences, of, elite, status, scribes, including, palettes, and, mortars, and, pestles, commoners, were, illiterate, scribes, were, drawn, from, the, elite, it, is, not, known, if, all, members, of, the, aristocracy, could, read, and, write, although, at, least, some, women, could, since, there, are, representations, of, female, scribes, in, maya, art, maya, scribes, were, called, aj, tz, ib, meaning, one, who, writes, or, paints, there, were, probably, scribal, schools, where, members, of, the, aristocracy, were, taught, to, write, scribal, activity, is, identifiable, in, the, archaeological, record, jasaw, chan, k, awiil, i, king, of, tikal, was, interred, with, his, paint, pot, some, junior, members, of, the, cop, n, royal, dynasty, have, also, been, found, buried, with, their, writing, implements, a, palace, at, cop, n, has, been, identified, as, that, of, a, noble, lineage, of, scribes, it, is, decorated, with, sculpture, that, includes, figures, holding, ink, pots, although, not, much, is, known, about, maya, scribes, some, did, sign, their, work, both, on, ceramics, and, on, stone, sculpture, usually, only, a, single, scribe, signed, a, ceramic, vessel, but, multiple, sculptors, are, known, to, have, recorded, their, names, on, stone, sculpture, eight, sculptors, signed, one, stela, at, piedras, negras, however, most, works, remained, unsigned, by, their, artists, in, common, with, the, other, mesoamerican, civilizations, the, maya, used, a, base, 20, vigesimal, system, the, bar, and, dot, counting, system, that, is, the, base, of, maya, numerals, was, in, use, in, mesoamerica, by, 1000, bc, the, maya, adopted, it, by, the, late, preclassic, and, added, the, symbol, for, zero, this, may, have, been, the, earliest, known, occurrence, of, the, idea, of, an, explicit, zero, worldwide, although, it, may, have, been, later, than, the, babylonian, system, the, earliest, explicit, use, of, zero, occurred, on, monuments, dated, to, 357, ad, in, its, earliest, uses, the, zero, served, as, a, place, holder, indicating, an, absence, of, a, particular, calendrical, count, this, later, developed, into, a, numeral, that, was, used, to, perform, calculation, and, was, used, in, hieroglyphic, texts, for, more, than, a, thousand, years, until, the, writing, system, was, extinguished, by, the, spanish, the, basic, number, system, consists, of, a, dot, to, represent, one, and, a, bar, to, represent, five, by, the, postclassic, period, a, shell, symbol, represented, zero, during, the, classic, period, other, glyphs, were, used, the, maya, numerals, from, 0, to, 19, used, repetitions, of, these, symbols, the, value, of, a, numeral, was, determined, by, its, position, as, a, numeral, shifted, upwards, its, basic, value, multiplied, by, twenty, in, this, way, the, lowest, symbol, would, represent, units, the, next, symbol, up, would, represent, multiples, of, twenty, and, the, symbol, above, that, would, represent, multiples, of, 400, and, so, on, for, example, the, number, 884, would, be, written, with, four, dots, on, the, lowest, level, four, dots, on, the, next, level, up, and, two, dots, on, the, next, level, after, that, to, give, 4, 1, 4, 20, 2, 400, 884, using, this, system, the, maya, were, able, to, record, huge, numbers, simple, addition, could, be, performed, by, summing, the, dots, and, bars, in, two, columns, to, give, the, result, in, a, third, column, the, maya, calendrical, system, in, common, with, other, mesoamerican, calendars, had, its, origins, in, the, preclassic, period, however, it, was, the, maya, that, developed, the, calendar, to, its, maximum, sophistication, recording, lunar, and, solar, cycles, eclipses, and, movements, of, planets, with, great, accuracy, in, some, cases, the, maya, calculations, were, more, accurate, than, equivalent, calculations, in, the, old, world, for, example, the, maya, solar, year, was, calculated, to, greater, accuracy, than, the, julian, year, the, maya, calendar, was, intrinsically, tied, to, maya, ritual, and, it, was, central, to, maya, religious, practices, the, calendar, combined, a, non, repeating, long, count, with, three, interlocking, cycles, each, measuring, a, progressively, larger, period, these, were, the, 260, day, tzolk, in, the, 365, day, haab, and, the, 52, year, calendar, round, resulting, from, the, combination, of, the, tzolk, in, with, the, haab, there, were, also, additional, calendric, cycles, such, as, an, 819, day, cycle, associated, with, the, four, quadrants, of, maya, cosmology, governed, by, four, different, aspects, of, the, god, k, awiil, the, basic, unit, in, the, maya, calendar, was, one, day, or, k, in, and, 20, k, in, grouped, to, form, a, winal, the, next, unit, instead, of, being, multiplied, by, 20, as, called, for, by, the, vigesimal, system, was, multiplied, by, 18, in, order, to, provide, a, rough, approximation, of, the, solar, year, hence, producing, 360, days, this, 360, day, year, was, called, a, tun, each, succeeding, level, of, multiplication, followed, the, vigesimal, system, the, 260, day, tzolk, in, provided, the, basic, cycle, of, maya, ceremony, and, the, foundations, of, maya, prophecy, no, astronomical, basis, for, this, count, has, been, proved, and, it, may, be, that, the, 260, day, count, is, based, on, the, human, gestation, period, this, is, reinforced, by, the, use, of, the, tzolk, in, to, record, dates, of, birth, and, provide, corresponding, prophecy, the, 260, day, cycle, repeated, a, series, of, 20, day, names, with, a, number, from, 1, to, 13, prefixed, to, indicated, where, in, the, cycle, a, particular, day, occurred, the, 365, day, haab, was, produced, by, a, cycle, of, eighteen, named, 20, day, winal, s, completed, by, the, addition, of, a, 5, day, period, called, the, wayeb, the, wayeb, was, considered, to, be, a, dangerous, time, when, the, barriers, between, the, mortal, and, supernatural, realms, were, broken, allowing, malignant, deities, to, cross, over, and, interfere, in, human, concerns, in, a, similar, way, to, the, tz, olkin, the, named, winal, would, be, prefixed, by, a, number, from, 0, to, 19, in, the, case, of, the, shorter, wayeb, period, the, prefix, numbers, ran, 0, to, 4, since, each, day, in, the, tz, olkin, had, a, name, and, number, e, g, 8, ajaw, this, would, interlock, with, the, haab, producing, an, additional, number, and, name, to, give, any, day, a, more, complete, designation, for, example, 8, ajaw, 13, keh, such, a, day, name, could, only, recur, once, every, 52, years, and, this, period, is, referred, to, by, mayanists, as, the, calendar, round, in, most, mesoamerican, cultures, the, calendar, round, was, the, largest, unit, for, measuring, time, as, with, any, non, repeating, calendar, the, maya, measured, time, from, a, fixed, start, point, the, maya, set, the, beginning, of, their, calendar, as, the, end, of, a, previous, cycle, of, bak, tun, s, equivalent, to, a, day, in, 3114, bc, this, was, believed, by, the, maya, to, be, the, day, of, the, creation, of, the, world, in, its, current, form, the, maya, used, the, long, count, calendar, to, fix, any, given, day, of, the, calendar, round, within, their, current, great, piktun, cycle, consisting, of, either, 20, bak, tun, s, there, was, some, variation, in, the, calendar, specifically, texts, in, palenque, demonstrate, that, the, piktun, cycle, that, ended, in, 3114, bc, had, only, 13, bak, tun, s, but, others, used, a, cycle, of, 13, 20, bak, tun, in, the, current, piktun, additionally, there, may, have, been, some, regional, variation, in, how, these, exceptional, cycles, were, managed, a, full, long, count, date, consisted, of, an, introductory, glyph, followed, by, five, glyphs, counting, off, the, number, of, bak, tun, s, kat, un, s, tun, s, winal, s, and, k, in, s, since, the, start, of, the, current, creation, this, would, be, followed, by, the, tz, olkin, portion, of, the, calendar, round, date, and, after, a, number, of, intervening, glyphs, the, long, count, date, would, end, with, the, haab, portion, of, the, calendar, round, date, although, the, calendar, round, is, still, in, use, today, the, maya, started, using, an, abbreviated, short, count, during, the, late, classic, period, the, short, count, is, a, count, of, 13, k, atuns, the, book, of, chilam, balam, of, chumayel, contains, the, only, colonial, reference, to, classic, long, count, dates, the, most, generally, accepted, correlation, is, the, goodman, mart, nez, thompson, or, gmt, correlation, this, equates, the, long, count, date, 11, 16, 0, 0, 0, 13, ajaw, 8, xul, with, the, gregorian, date, of, 12, november, 1539, epigraphers, simon, martin, and, nikolai, grube, argue, for, a, two, day, shift, from, the, standard, gmt, correlation, the, spinden, correlation, would, shift, the, long, count, dates, back, by, 260, years, it, also, accords, with, the, documentary, evidence, and, is, better, suited, to, the, archaeology, of, the, yucat, n, peninsula, but, presents, problems, with, the, rest, of, the, maya, region, the, george, vaillant, correlation, would, shift, all, maya, dates, 260, years, later, and, would, greatly, shorten, the, postclassic, period, radiocarbon, dating, of, dated, wooden, lintels, at, tikal, supports, the, gmt, correlation, the, famous, astrologer, john, dee, used, an, aztec, obsidian, mirror, to, see, into, the, future, we, may, look, down, our, noses, at, his, ideas, but, one, may, be, sure, that, in, outlook, he, was, far, closer, to, a, maya, priest, astronomer, than, is, an, astronomer, of, our, century, the, maya, made, meticulous, observations, of, celestial, bodies, this, information, was, used, for, divination, so, maya, astronomy, was, essentially, for, astrological, purposes, although, maya, astronomy, was, mainly, used, by, the, priesthood, to, comprehend, past, cycles, of, time, and, project, them, into, the, future, to, produce, prophecy, it, also, had, some, practical, applications, such, as, providing, aid, in, crop, planting, and, harvesting, the, priesthood, refined, observations, and, recorded, eclipses, of, the, sun, and, moon, and, movements, of, venus, and, the, stars, these, were, measured, against, dated, events, in, the, past, on, the, assumption, that, similar, events, would, occur, in, the, future, when, the, same, astronomical, conditions, prevailed, illustrations, in, the, codices, show, that, priests, made, astronomical, observations, using, the, naked, eye, assisted, by, crossed, sticks, as, a, sighting, device, analysis, of, the, few, remaining, postclassic, codices, has, revealed, that, at, the, time, of, european, contact, the, maya, had, recorded, eclipse, tables, calendars, and, astronomical, knowledge, that, was, more, accurate, at, that, time, than, comparable, knowledge, in, europe, the, maya, measured, the, 584, day, venus, cycle, with, an, error, of, just, two, hours, five, cycles, of, venus, equated, to, eight, 365, day, haab, calendrical, cycles, and, this, period, was, recorded, in, the, codices, the, maya, also, followed, the, movements, of, jupiter, mars, and, mercury, when, venus, rose, as, the, morning, star, this, was, associated, with, the, rebirth, of, the, maya, hero, twins, for, the, maya, the, heliacal, rising, of, venus, was, associated, with, destruction, and, upheaval, venus, was, closely, associated, with, warfare, and, the, hieroglyph, meaning, war, incorporated, the, glyph, element, symbolizing, the, planet, sight, lines, through, the, windows, of, the, caracol, building, at, chichen, itza, align, with, the, northernmost, and, southernmost, extremes, of, venus, path, maya, rulers, launched, military, campaigns, to, coincide, with, the, heliacal, or, cosmical, rising, of, venus, and, would, also, sacrifice, important, captives, to, coincide, with, such, conjunctions, solar, and, lunar, eclipses, were, considered, to, be, especially, dangerous, events, that, could, bring, catastrophe, upon, the, world, in, the, dresden, codex, a, solar, eclipse, is, represented, by, a, serpent, devouring, the, k, in, day, hieroglyph, eclipses, were, interpreted, as, the, sun, or, moon, being, bitten, and, lunar, tables, were, recorded, in, order, that, the, maya, might, be, able, to, predict, them, and, perform, the, appropriate, ceremonies, to, ward, off, disaster, in, common, with, the, rest, of, mesoamerica, the, maya, believed, in, a, supernatural, realm, inhabited, by, an, array, of, powerful, deities, who, needed, to, be, placated, with, ceremonial, offerings, and, ritual, practices, at, the, core, of, maya, religious, practice, was, the, worship, of, deceased, ancestors, who, would, intercede, for, their, living, descendants, in, dealings, with, the, supernatural, realm, the, earliest, intermediaries, between, humans, and, the, supernatural, were, shamans, maya, ritual, included, the, use, of, hallucinogens, for, chilan, oracular, priests, visions, for, the, chilan, were, likely, facilitated, by, consumption, of, water, lilies, which, are, hallucinogenic, in, high, doses, as, the, maya, civilization, developed, the, ruling, elite, codified, the, maya, world, view, into, religious, cults, that, justified, their, right, to, rule, in, the, late, preclassic, this, process, culminated, in, the, institution, of, the, divine, king, the, k, uhul, ajaw, endowed, with, ultimate, political, and, religious, power, the, maya, viewed, the, cosmos, as, highly, structured, there, were, thirteen, levels, in, the, heavens, and, nine, in, the, underworld, with, the, mortal, world, in, between, each, level, had, four, cardinal, directions, associated, with, a, different, colour, north, was, white, east, was, red, south, was, yellow, and, west, was, black, major, deities, had, aspects, associated, with, these, directions, and, colours, maya, households, interred, their, dead, underneath, the, floors, with, offerings, appropriate, to, the, social, status, of, the, family, there, the, dead, could, act, as, protective, ancestors, maya, lineages, were, patrilineal, so, the, worship, of, a, prominent, male, ancestor, would, be, emphasised, often, with, a, household, shrine, as, maya, society, developed, and, the, elite, became, more, powerful, maya, royalty, developed, their, household, shrines, into, the, great, pyramids, that, held, the, tombs, of, their, ancestors, belief, in, supernatural, forces, pervaded, maya, life, from, the, simplest, day, to, day, activities, such, as, cooking, to, trade, politics, and, elite, activities, maya, deities, governed, all, aspects, of, the, world, both, visible, and, invisible, the, maya, priesthood, was, a, closed, group, drawing, its, members, from, the, established, elite, by, the, early, classic, they, were, recording, increasingly, complex, ritual, information, in, their, hieroglyphic, books, including, astronomical, observations, calendrical, cycles, history, and, mythology, the, priests, performed, public, ceremonies, that, incorporated, feasting, bloodletting, incense, burning, music, ritual, dance, and, on, certain, occasions, human, sacrifice, during, the, classic, period, the, maya, ruler, was, the, high, priest, and, the, direct, conduit, between, mortals, and, the, gods, it, is, highly, likely, that, among, commoners, shamanism, continued, in, parallel, to, state, religion, by, the, postclassic, religious, emphasis, had, changed, there, was, an, increase, in, worship, of, the, images, of, deities, and, more, frequent, recourse, to, human, sacrifice, archaeologists, painstakingly, reconstruct, these, ritual, practices, and, beliefs, using, several, techniques, one, important, though, incomplete, resource, is, physical, evidence, such, as, dedicatory, caches, and, other, ritual, deposits, shrines, and, burials, with, their, associated, funerary, offerings, maya, art, architecture, and, writing, are, another, resource, and, these, can, be, combined, with, ethnographic, sources, including, records, of, maya, religious, practices, made, by, the, spanish, during, the, conquest, blood, was, viewed, as, a, potent, source, of, nourishment, for, the, maya, deities, and, the, sacrifice, of, a, living, creature, was, a, powerful, blood, offering, by, extension, the, sacrifice, of, a, human, life, was, the, ultimate, offering, of, blood, to, the, gods, and, the, most, important, maya, rituals, culminated, in, human, sacrifice, generally, only, high, status, prisoners, of, war, were, sacrificed, with, lower, status, captives, being, used, for, labour, important, rituals, such, as, the, dedication, of, major, building, projects, or, the, enthronement, of, a, new, ruler, required, a, human, offering, the, sacrifice, of, an, enemy, king, was, the, most, prized, and, such, a, sacrifice, involved, decapitation, of, the, captive, ruler, perhaps, in, a, ritual, reenactment, of, the, decapitation, of, the, maya, maize, god, by, the, death, gods, in, ad, 738, the, vassal, king, k, ak, tiliw, chan, yopaat, of, quirigu, captured, his, overlord, uaxaclajuun, ub, aah, k, awiil, of, cop, n, and, a, few, days, later, ritually, decapitated, him, sacrifice, by, decapitation, is, depicted, in, classic, period, maya, art, and, sometimes, took, place, after, the, victim, was, tortured, being, variously, beaten, scalped, burnt, or, disembowelled, another, myth, associated, with, decapitation, was, that, of, the, hero, twins, recounted, in, the, popol, vuh, playing, a, ballgame, against, the, gods, of, the, underworld, the, heroes, achieved, victory, but, one, of, each, pair, of, twins, was, decapitated, by, their, opponents, during, the, postclassic, period, the, most, common, form, of, human, sacrifice, was, heart, extraction, influenced, by, the, rites, of, the, aztecs, in, the, valley, of, mexico, this, usually, took, place, in, the, courtyard, of, a, temple, or, upon, the, summit, of, the, pyramid, in, one, ritual, the, corpse, would, be, skinned, by, assistant, priests, except, for, the, hands, and, feet, and, the, officiating, priest, would, then, dress, himself, in, the, skin, of, the, sacrificial, victim, and, perform, a, ritual, dance, symbolizing, the, rebirth, of, life, archaeological, investigations, indicate, that, heart, sacrifice, was, practised, as, early, as, the, classic, period, the, maya, world, was, populated, by, a, great, variety, of, deities, supernatural, entities, and, sacred, forces, the, maya, had, such, a, broad, interpretation, of, the, sacred, that, identifying, distinct, deities, with, specific, functions, is, inaccurate, the, maya, interpretation, of, deities, was, closely, tied, to, the, calendar, astronomy, and, their, cosmology, the, importance, of, a, deity, its, characteristics, and, its, associations, varied, according, to, the, movement, of, celestial, bodies, the, priestly, interpretation, of, astronomical, records, and, books, was, therefore, crucial, since, the, priest, would, understand, which, deity, required, ritual, propitiation, when, the, correct, ceremonies, should, be, performed, and, what, would, be, an, appropriate, offering, each, deity, had, four, manifestations, associated, with, the, cardinal, directions, each, identified, with, a, different, colour, they, also, had, a, dual, day, night, life, death, aspect, itzamna, was, the, creator, god, but, he, also, embodied, the, cosmos, and, was, simultaneously, a, sun, god, k, inich, ahau, the, day, sun, was, one, of, his, aspects, maya, kings, frequently, identified, themselves, with, k, inich, ahau, itzamna, also, had, a, night, sun, aspect, the, night, jaguar, representing, the, sun, in, its, journey, through, the, underworld, the, four, pawatuns, supported, the, corners, of, the, mortal, realm, in, the, heavens, the, bacabs, performed, the, same, function, as, well, as, their, four, main, aspects, the, bakabs, had, dozens, of, other, aspects, that, are, not, well, understood, the, four, chaacs, were, storm, gods, controlling, thunder, lightning, and, the, rains, the, nine, lords, of, the, night, each, governed, one, of, the, underworld, realms, other, important, deities, included, the, moon, goddess, the, maize, god, and, the, hero, twins, the, popol, vuh, was, written, in, the, latin, script, in, early, colonial, times, and, was, probably, transcribed, from, a, hieroglyphic, book, by, an, unknown, k, iche, maya, nobleman, it, is, one, of, the, most, outstanding, works, of, indigenous, literature, in, the, americas, the, popul, vuh, recounts, the, mythical, creation, of, the, world, the, legend, of, the, hero, twins, and, the, history, of, the, postclassic, k, iche, kingdom, deities, recorded, in, the, popul, vuh, include, hun, hunahpu, believed, by, some, to, be, the, k, iche, maize, god, and, a, triad, of, deities, led, by, the, k, iche, patron, tohil, and, also, including, the, moon, goddess, awilix, and, the, mountain, god, jacawitz, in, common, with, other, mesoamerican, cultures, the, maya, worshipped, feathered, serpent, deities, such, worship, was, rare, during, the, classic, period, but, by, the, postclassic, the, feathered, serpent, had, spread, to, both, the, yucat, n, peninsula, and, the, guatemalan, highlands, in, yucat, n, the, feathered, serpent, deity, was, kukulkan, among, the, k, iche, it, was, q, uq, umatz, kukulkan, had, his, origins, in, the, classic, period, war, serpent, waxaklahun, ubah, kan, and, has, also, been, identified, as, the, postclassic, version, of, the, vision, serpent, of, classic, maya, art, although, the, cult, of, kukulkan, had, its, origins, in, these, earlier, maya, traditions, the, worship, of, kukulkan, was, heavily, influenced, by, the, quetzalcoatl, cult, of, central, mexico, likewise, q, uq, umatz, had, a, composite, origin, combining, the, attributes, of, mexican, quetzalcoatl, with, aspects, of, the, classic, period, itzamna, the, ancient, maya, had, diverse, and, sophisticated, methods, of, food, production, it, was, believed, that, shifting, cultivation, swidden, agriculture, provided, most, of, their, food, but, it, is,
