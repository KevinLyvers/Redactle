on, the, greek, side, on, the, trojan, side, the, trojan, war, was, a, legendary, conflict, in, greek, mythology, that, took, place, around, the, 12th, or, 13th, century, bc, the, war, was, waged, by, the, achaeans, greeks, against, the, city, of, troy, after, paris, of, troy, took, helen, from, her, husband, menelaus, king, of, sparta, the, war, is, one, of, the, most, important, events, in, greek, mythology, and, it, has, been, narrated, through, many, works, of, greek, literature, most, notably, homer, s, iliad, the, core, of, the, iliad, books, ii, xxiii, describes, a, period, of, four, days, and, two, nights, in, the, tenth, year, of, the, decade, long, siege, of, troy, the, odyssey, describes, the, journey, home, of, odysseus, one, of, the, war, s, heroes, other, parts, of, the, war, are, described, in, a, cycle, of, epic, poems, which, have, survived, through, fragments, episodes, from, the, war, provided, material, for, greek, tragedy, and, other, works, of, greek, literature, and, for, roman, poets, including, virgil, and, ovid, the, ancient, greeks, believed, that, troy, was, located, near, the, dardanelles, and, that, the, trojan, war, was, a, historical, event, of, the, 13th, or, 12th, century, bc, by, the, mid, 19th, century, ad, both, the, war, and, the, city, were, widely, seen, as, non, historical, but, in, 1868, the, german, archaeologist, heinrich, schliemann, met, frank, calvert, who, convinced, schliemann, that, troy, was, at, what, is, now, hisarl, k, in, modern, day, turkey, on, the, basis, of, excavations, conducted, by, schliemann, and, others, this, claim, is, now, accepted, by, most, scholars, the, historicity, of, the, trojan, war, remains, an, open, question, many, scholars, believe, that, there, is, a, historical, core, to, the, tale, though, this, may, simply, mean, that, the, homeric, stories, are, a, fusion, of, various, tales, of, sieges, and, expeditions, by, mycenaean, greeks, during, the, bronze, age, those, who, believe, that, the, stories, of, the, trojan, war, are, derived, from, a, specific, historical, conflict, usually, date, it, to, the, 12th, or, 11th, century, bc, often, preferring, the, dates, given, by, eratosthenes, 1194, 1184, bc, which, roughly, correspond, to, archaeological, evidence, of, a, catastrophic, burning, of, troy, vii, and, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, the, events, of, the, trojan, war, are, found, in, many, works, of, greek, literature, and, depicted, in, numerous, works, of, greek, art, there, is, no, single, authoritative, text, which, tells, the, entire, events, of, the, war, instead, the, story, is, assembled, from, a, variety, of, sources, some, of, which, report, contradictory, versions, of, the, events, the, most, important, literary, sources, are, the, two, epic, poems, traditionally, credited, to, homer, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, composed, sometime, between, the, 9th, and, 6th, centuries, bc, each, poem, narrates, only, a, part, of, the, war, the, iliad, covers, a, short, period, in, the, last, year, of, the, siege, of, troy, while, the, odyssey, concerns, odysseus, s, return, to, his, home, island, of, ithaca, following, the, sack, of, troy, and, contains, several, flashbacks, to, particular, episodes, in, the, war, other, parts, of, the, trojan, war, were, told, in, the, poems, of, the, epic, cycle, also, known, as, the, cyclic, epics, the, cypria, aethiopis, little, iliad, iliou, persis, nostoi, and, telegony, though, these, poems, survive, only, in, fragments, their, content, is, known, from, a, summary, included, in, proclus, chrestomathy, the, authorship, of, the, cyclic, epics, is, uncertain, it, is, generally, thought, that, the, poems, were, written, down, in, the, 7th, and, 6th, century, bc, after, the, composition, of, the, homeric, poems, though, it, is, widely, believed, that, they, were, based, on, earlier, traditions, both, the, homeric, epics, and, the, epic, cycle, take, origin, from, oral, tradition, even, after, the, composition, of, the, iliad, odyssey, and, the, cyclic, epics, the, myths, of, the, trojan, war, were, passed, on, orally, in, many, genres, of, poetry, and, through, non, poetic, storytelling, events, and, details, of, the, story, that, are, only, found, in, later, authors, may, have, been, passed, on, through, oral, tradition, and, could, be, as, old, as, the, homeric, poems, visual, art, such, as, vase, painting, was, another, medium, in, which, myths, of, the, trojan, war, circulated, in, later, ages, playwrights, historians, and, other, intellectuals, would, create, works, inspired, by, the, trojan, war, the, three, great, tragedians, of, athens, aeschylus, sophocles, and, euripides, wrote, a, number, of, dramas, that, portray, episodes, from, the, trojan, war, among, roman, writers, the, most, important, is, the, 1st, century, bc, poet, virgil, in, book, 2, of, his, aeneid, aeneas, narrates, the, sack, of, troy, traditionally, the, trojan, war, arose, from, a, sequence, of, events, beginning, with, a, quarrel, between, the, goddesses, hera, athena, and, aphrodite, eris, the, goddess, of, discord, was, not, invited, to, the, wedding, of, peleus, and, thetis, and, so, arrived, bearing, a, gift, a, golden, apple, inscribed, for, the, fairest, each, of, the, goddesses, claimed, to, be, the, fairest, and, the, rightful, owner, of, the, apple, they, submitted, the, judgment, to, a, shepherd, they, encountered, tending, his, flock, each, of, the, goddesses, promised, the, young, man, a, boon, in, return, for, his, favour, power, wisdom, or, love, the, youth, in, fact, paris, a, trojan, prince, who, had, been, raised, in, the, countryside, chose, love, and, awarded, the, apple, to, aphrodite, as, his, reward, aphrodite, caused, helen, the, queen, of, sparta, and, most, beautiful, of, all, women, to, fall, in, love, with, paris, the, judgement, of, paris, earned, him, the, ire, of, both, hera, and, athena, and, when, helen, left, her, husband, menelaus, the, spartan, king, for, paris, of, troy, menelaus, called, upon, all, the, kings, and, princes, of, greece, to, wage, war, upon, troy, menelaus, brother, agamemnon, king, of, mycenae, led, an, expedition, of, achaean, troops, to, troy, and, besieged, the, city, for, ten, years, because, of, paris, insult, after, the, deaths, of, many, heroes, including, the, achaeans, achilles, and, ajax, and, the, trojans, hector, and, paris, the, city, fell, to, the, ruse, of, the, trojan, horse, the, achaeans, slaughtered, the, trojans, except, for, some, of, the, women, and, children, whom, they, kept, or, sold, as, slaves, and, desecrated, the, temples, thus, earning, the, gods, wrath, few, of, the, achaeans, returned, safely, to, their, homes, and, many, founded, colonies, in, distant, shores, the, romans, later, traced, their, origin, to, aeneas, aphrodite, s, son, and, one, of, the, trojans, who, was, said, to, have, led, the, surviving, trojans, to, italy, the, following, summary, of, the, trojan, war, follows, the, order, of, events, as, given, in, proclus, summary, along, with, the, iliad, odyssey, and, aeneid, supplemented, with, details, drawn, from, other, authors, according, to, greek, mythology, zeus, had, become, king, of, the, gods, by, overthrowing, his, father, cronus, cronus, in, turn, had, overthrown, his, father, uranus, zeus, was, not, faithful, to, his, wife, and, sister, hera, and, had, many, relationships, from, which, many, children, were, born, since, zeus, believed, that, there, were, too, many, people, populating, the, earth, he, envisioned, momus, or, themis, who, was, to, use, the, trojan, war, as, a, means, to, depopulate, the, earth, especially, of, his, demigod, descendants, these, can, be, supported, by, hesiod, s, account, now, all, the, gods, were, divided, through, strife, for, at, that, very, time, zeus, who, thunders, on, high, was, meditating, marvelous, deeds, even, to, mingle, storm, and, tempest, over, the, boundless, earth, and, already, he, was, hastening, to, make, an, utter, end, of, the, race, of, mortal, men, declaring, that, he, would, destroy, the, lives, of, the, demi, gods, that, the, children, of, the, gods, should, not, mate, with, wretched, mortals, seeing, their, fate, with, their, own, eyes, but, that, the, blessed, gods, henceforth, even, as, aforetime, should, have, their, living, and, their, habitations, apart, from, men, but, on, those, who, were, born, of, immortals, and, of, mankind, verily, zeus, laid, toil, and, sorrow, upon, sorrow, zeus, came, to, learn, from, either, themis, or, prometheus, after, heracles, had, released, him, from, the, caucasus, that, like, his, father, cronus, he, would, be, overthrown, by, one, of, his, sons, another, prophecy, stated, that, a, son, of, the, sea, nymph, thetis, with, whom, zeus, fell, in, love, after, gazing, upon, her, in, the, oceans, off, the, greek, coast, would, become, greater, than, his, father, for, one, or, both, of, these, reasons, either, upon, zeus, orders, or, because, she, wished, to, please, hera, who, had, raised, her, thetis, was, betrothed, to, an, elderly, human, king, peleus, son, of, aeacus, all, of, the, gods, were, invited, to, peleus, and, thetis, wedding, and, brought, many, gifts, except, eris, the, goddess, of, discord, who, was, stopped, at, the, door, by, hermes, on, zeus, order, insulted, she, threw, from, the, door, a, gift, of, her, own, a, golden, apple, ancient, greek, on, which, was, inscribed, the, word, kallist, to, the, fairest, the, apple, was, claimed, by, hera, athena, and, aphrodite, they, quarrelled, bitterly, over, it, and, none, of, the, other, gods, would, venture, an, opinion, favouring, one, for, fear, of, earning, the, enmity, of, the, other, two, eventually, zeus, ordered, hermes, to, lead, the, three, goddesses, to, paris, a, prince, of, troy, who, unaware, of, his, ancestry, was, being, raised, as, a, shepherd, on, mount, ida, because, of, a, prophecy, that, he, would, be, the, downfall, of, troy, after, bathing, in, the, spring, of, ida, the, goddesses, appeared, to, him, naked, either, for, the, sake, of, winning, or, at, paris, request, paris, was, unable, to, decide, among, them, so, the, goddesses, resorted, to, bribes, athena, offered, paris, wisdom, skill, in, battle, and, the, abilities, of, the, greatest, warriors, hera, offered, him, political, power, and, control, of, all, of, asia, and, aphrodite, offered, him, the, love, of, the, most, beautiful, woman, in, the, world, helen, of, sparta, paris, awarded, the, apple, to, aphrodite, and, after, several, adventures, returned, to, troy, where, he, was, recognised, by, his, royal, family, peleus, and, thetis, bore, a, son, whom, they, named, achilles, it, was, foretold, that, he, would, either, die, of, old, age, after, an, uneventful, life, or, die, young, in, a, battlefield, and, gain, immortality, through, poetry, furthermore, when, achilles, was, nine, years, old, calchas, had, prophesied, that, troy, could, not, again, fall, without, his, help, a, number, of, sources, credit, thetis, with, attempting, to, make, achilles, immortal, when, he, was, an, infant, some, of, these, state, that, she, held, him, over, fire, every, night, to, burn, away, his, mortal, parts, and, rubbed, him, with, ambrosia, during, the, day, but, peleus, discovered, her, actions, and, stopped, her, according, to, some, versions, of, this, story, thetis, had, already, killed, several, sons, in, this, manner, and, peleus, action, therefore, saved, his, son, s, life, other, sources, state, that, thetis, bathed, achilles, in, the, styx, the, river, that, runs, to, the, underworld, making, him, invulnerable, wherever, he, was, touched, by, the, water, because, she, had, held, him, by, the, heel, it, was, not, entirely, immersed, during, the, bathing, and, thus, the, heel, remained, mortal, and, vulnerable, to, injury, hence, the, expression, achilles, heel, for, an, isolated, weakness, he, grew, up, to, be, the, greatest, of, all, mortal, warriors, after, calchas, prophecy, thetis, hid, achilles, in, skyros, at, the, court, of, king, lycomedes, where, he, was, disguised, as, a, girl, at, a, crucial, point, in, the, war, she, assists, her, son, by, providing, weapons, divinely, forged, by, hephaestus, see, below, the, most, beautiful, woman, in, the, world, was, helen, one, of, the, daughters, of, tyndareus, king, of, sparta, her, mother, was, leda, who, had, been, either, raped, or, seduced, by, zeus, in, the, form, of, a, swan, accounts, differ, over, which, of, leda, s, four, children, two, pairs, of, twins, were, fathered, by, zeus, and, which, by, tyndareus, however, helen, is, usually, credited, as, zeus, daughter, and, sometimes, nemesis, is, credited, as, her, mother, helen, had, scores, of, suitors, and, her, father, was, unwilling, to, choose, one, for, fear, the, others, would, retaliate, violently, finally, one, of, the, suitors, odysseus, of, ithaca, proposed, a, plan, to, solve, the, dilemma, in, exchange, for, tyndareus, support, of, his, own, suit, towards, penelope, he, suggested, that, tyndareus, require, all, of, helen, s, suitors, to, promise, that, they, would, defend, the, marriage, of, helen, regardless, of, whom, he, chose, the, suitors, duly, swore, the, required, oath, on, the, severed, pieces, of, a, horse, although, not, without, a, certain, amount, of, grumbling, tyndareus, chose, menelaus, menelaus, was, a, political, choice, on, her, father, s, part, he, had, wealth, and, power, he, had, humbly, not, petitioned, for, her, himself, but, instead, sent, his, brother, agamemnon, on, his, behalf, he, had, promised, aphrodite, a, hecatomb, a, sacrifice, of, 100, oxen, if, he, won, helen, but, forgot, about, it, and, earned, her, wrath, menelaus, inherited, tyndareus, throne, of, sparta, with, helen, as, his, queen, when, her, brothers, castor, and, pollux, became, gods, and, when, agamemnon, married, helen, s, sister, clytemnestra, and, took, back, the, throne, of, mycenae, paris, under, the, guise, of, a, supposed, diplomatic, mission, went, to, sparta, to, get, helen, and, bring, her, back, to, troy, before, helen, could, look, up, to, see, him, enter, the, palace, she, was, shot, with, an, arrow, from, eros, otherwise, known, as, cupid, and, fell, in, love, with, paris, when, she, saw, him, as, promised, by, aphrodite, menelaus, had, left, for, crete, to, bury, his, uncle, crateus, according, to, one, account, hera, still, jealous, over, the, judgement, of, paris, sent, a, storm, the, storm, caused, the, lovers, to, land, in, egypt, where, the, gods, replaced, helen, with, a, likeness, of, her, made, of, clouds, nephele, the, myth, of, helen, being, switched, is, attributed, to, the, 6th, century, bc, sicilian, poet, stesichorus, while, for, homer, the, helen, in, troy, was, one, and, the, same, the, ship, then, landed, in, sidon, paris, fearful, of, getting, caught, spent, some, time, there, and, then, sailed, to, troy, paris, abduction, of, helen, had, several, precedents, io, was, taken, from, mycenae, europa, was, taken, from, phoenicia, jason, took, medea, from, colchis, and, the, trojan, princess, hesione, had, been, taken, by, heracles, who, gave, her, to, telamon, of, salamis, according, to, herodotus, paris, was, emboldened, by, these, examples, to, steal, himself, a, wife, from, greece, and, expected, no, retribution, since, there, had, been, none, in, the, other, cases, according, to, homer, menelaus, and, his, ally, odysseus, travelled, to, troy, where, they, unsuccessfully, sought, to, recover, helen, by, diplomatic, means, menelaus, then, asked, agamemnon, to, help, him, enforce, the, oath, of, helen, s, suitors, which, was, to, defend, her, marriage, regardless, of, which, suitor, was, chosen, agamemnon, agreed, and, sent, emissaries, to, all, the, achaean, kings, and, princes, to, call, them, to, observe, their, oath, and, retrieve, helen, since, menelaus, s, wedding, odysseus, had, married, penelope, and, fathered, a, son, telemachus, in, order, to, avoid, the, war, he, feigned, madness, and, sowed, his, fields, with, salt, palamedes, outwitted, him, by, placing, telemachus, then, an, infant, in, front, of, the, plough, s, path, odysseus, turned, aside, unwilling, to, kill, his, son, so, revealing, his, sanity, and, forcing, him, to, join, the, war, according, to, homer, however, odysseus, supported, the, military, adventure, from, the, beginning, and, travelled, the, region, with, pylos, king, nestor, to, recruit, forces, at, skyros, achilles, had, an, affair, with, the, king, s, daughter, deidamia, resulting, in, a, child, neoptolemus, odysseus, telamonian, ajax, and, achilles, tutor, phoenix, went, to, retrieve, achilles, achilles, mother, disguised, him, as, a, woman, so, that, he, would, not, have, to, go, to, war, but, according, to, one, story, they, blew, a, horn, and, achilles, revealed, himself, by, seizing, a, spear, to, fight, intruders, rather, than, fleeing, according, to, another, story, they, disguised, themselves, as, merchants, bearing, trinkets, and, weaponry, and, achilles, was, marked, out, from, the, other, women, for, admiring, weaponry, instead, of, clothes, and, jewellery, pausanias, said, that, according, to, homer, achilles, did, not, hide, in, skyros, but, rather, conquered, the, island, as, part, of, the, trojan, war, the, achaean, forces, first, gathered, at, aulis, all, the, suitors, sent, their, forces, except, king, cinyras, of, cyprus, though, he, sent, breastplates, to, agamemnon, and, promised, to, send, 50, ships, he, sent, only, one, real, ship, led, by, the, son, of, mygdalion, and, 49, ships, made, of, clay, idomeneus, was, willing, to, lead, the, cretan, contingent, in, mycenae, s, war, against, troy, but, only, as, a, co, commander, which, he, was, granted, the, last, commander, to, arrive, was, achilles, who, was, then, 15, years, old, following, a, sacrifice, to, apollo, a, snake, slithered, from, the, altar, to, a, sparrow, s, nest, in, a, plane, tree, nearby, it, ate, the, mother, and, her, nine, chicks, then, was, turned, to, stone, calchas, interpreted, this, as, a, sign, that, troy, would, fall, in, the, tenth, year, of, the, war, when, the, achaeans, left, for, the, war, they, did, not, know, the, way, and, accidentally, landed, in, mysia, ruled, by, king, telephus, son, of, heracles, who, had, led, a, contingent, of, arcadians, to, settle, there, in, the, battle, achilles, wounded, telephus, who, had, killed, thersander, because, the, wound, would, not, heal, telephus, asked, an, oracle, what, will, happen, to, the, wound, the, oracle, responded, he, that, wounded, shall, heal, the, achaean, fleet, then, set, sail, and, was, scattered, by, a, storm, achilles, landed, in, skyros, and, married, deidamia, a, new, gathering, was, set, again, in, aulis, telephus, went, to, aulis, and, either, pretended, to, be, a, beggar, asking, agamemnon, to, help, heal, his, wound, or, kidnapped, orestes, and, held, him, for, ransom, demanding, the, wound, be, healed, achilles, refused, claiming, to, have, no, medical, knowledge, odysseus, reasoned, that, the, spear, that, had, inflicted, the, wound, must, be, able, to, heal, it, pieces, of, the, spear, were, scraped, off, onto, the, wound, and, telephus, was, healed, telephus, then, showed, the, achaeans, the, route, to, troy, some, scholars, have, regarded, the, expedition, against, telephus, and, its, resolution, as, a, derivative, reworking, of, elements, from, the, main, story, of, the, trojan, war, but, it, has, also, been, seen, as, fitting, the, story, pattern, of, the, preliminary, adventure, that, anticipates, events, and, themes, from, the, main, narrative, and, therefore, as, likely, to, be, early, and, integral, eight, years, after, the, storm, had, scattered, them, the, fleet, of, more, than, a, thousand, ships, was, gathered, again, when, they, had, all, reached, aulis, the, winds, ceased, the, prophet, calchas, stated, that, the, goddess, artemis, was, punishing, agamemnon, for, killing, either, a, sacred, deer, or, a, deer, in, a, sacred, grove, and, boasting, that, he, was, a, better, hunter, than, she, the, only, way, to, appease, artemis, he, said, was, to, sacrifice, iphigenia, who, was, either, the, daughter, of, agamemnon, and, clytemnestra, or, of, helen, and, theseus, entrusted, to, clytemnestra, when, helen, married, menelaus, agamemnon, refused, and, the, other, commanders, threatened, to, make, palamedes, commander, of, the, expedition, according, to, some, versions, agamemnon, relented, and, performed, the, sacrifice, but, others, claim, that, he, sacrificed, a, deer, in, her, place, or, that, at, the, last, moment, artemis, took, pity, on, the, girl, and, took, her, to, be, a, maiden, in, one, of, her, temples, substituting, a, lamb, hesiod, says, that, iphigenia, became, the, goddess, hecate, the, achaean, forces, are, described, in, detail, in, the, catalogue, of, ships, in, the, second, book, of, the, iliad, they, consisted, of, 28, contingents, from, mainland, greece, the, peloponnese, the, dodecanese, islands, crete, and, ithaca, comprising, 1186, pentekonters, ships, with, 50, rowers, thucydides, says, that, according, to, tradition, there, were, about, 1200, ships, and, that, the, boeotian, ships, had, 120, men, while, philoctetes, ships, only, had, the, fifty, rowers, these, probably, being, maximum, and, minimum, these, numbers, would, mean, a, total, force, of, 70, 000, to, 130, 000, men, another, catalogue, of, ships, is, given, by, the, bibliotheca, that, differs, somewhat, but, agrees, in, numbers, some, scholars, have, claimed, that, homer, s, catalogue, is, an, original, bronze, age, document, possibly, the, achaean, commander, s, order, of, operations, others, believe, it, was, a, fabrication, of, homer, the, second, book, of, the, iliad, also, lists, the, trojan, allies, consisting, of, the, trojans, themselves, led, by, hector, and, various, allies, listed, as, dardanians, led, by, aeneas, zeleians, adrasteians, percotians, pelasgians, thracians, ciconian, spearmen, paionian, archers, halizones, mysians, phrygians, maeonians, miletians, lycians, led, by, sarpedon, and, carians, nothing, is, said, of, the, trojan, language, the, carians, are, specifically, said, to, be, barbarian, speaking, and, the, allied, contingents, are, said, to, have, spoken, many, languages, requiring, orders, to, be, translated, by, their, individual, commanders, the, trojans, and, achaeans, in, the, iliad, share, the, same, religion, same, culture, and, the, enemy, heroes, speak, to, each, other, in, the, same, language, though, this, could, be, dramatic, effect, philoctetes, was, heracles, friend, and, because, he, lit, heracles, s, funeral, pyre, when, no, one, else, would, he, received, heracles, bow, and, arrows, he, sailed, with, seven, ships, full, of, men, to, the, trojan, war, where, he, was, planning, on, fighting, for, the, achaeans, they, stopped, either, at, chryse, island, for, supplies, or, in, tenedos, along, with, the, rest, of, the, fleet, then, philoctetes, was, bitten, by, a, snake, the, wound, festered, and, had, a, foul, smell, on, odysseus, s, advice, the, atreidae, ordered, philoctetes, to, stay, on, lemnos, medon, took, control, of, philoctetes, s, men, while, landing, on, tenedos, achilles, killed, king, tenes, son, of, apollo, despite, a, warning, by, his, mother, that, if, he, did, so, he, would, be, killed, himself, by, apollo, from, tenedos, agamemnon, sent, an, embassy, to, the, priam, king, of, troy, composed, of, menelaus, and, odysseus, asking, for, helen, s, return, the, embassy, was, refused, philoctetes, stayed, on, lemnos, for, ten, years, which, was, a, deserted, island, according, to, sophocles, tragedy, philoctetes, but, according, to, earlier, tradition, was, populated, by, minyans, calchas, had, prophesied, that, the, first, achaean, to, walk, on, land, after, stepping, off, a, ship, would, be, the, first, to, die, thus, even, the, leading, greeks, hesitated, to, land, finally, protesilaus, leader, of, the, phylaceans, landed, first, odysseus, had, tricked, him, in, throwing, his, own, shield, down, to, land, on, so, that, while, he, was, first, to, leap, off, his, ship, he, was, not, the, first, to, land, on, trojan, soil, hector, killed, protesilaus, in, single, combat, though, the, trojans, conceded, the, beach, in, the, second, wave, of, attacks, achilles, killed, cycnus, son, of, poseidon, the, trojans, then, fled, to, the, safety, of, the, walls, of, their, city, the, walls, served, as, sturdy, fortifications, for, defence, against, the, greeks, the, build, of, the, walls, was, so, impressive, that, legend, held, that, they, had, been, built, by, poseidon, and, apollo, during, a, year, of, forced, service, to, trojan, king, laomedon, protesilaus, had, killed, many, trojans, but, was, killed, by, hector, in, most, versions, of, the, story, though, others, list, aeneas, achates, or, ephorbus, as, his, slayer, the, achaeans, buried, him, as, a, god, on, the, thracian, peninsula, across, the, tro, d, after, protesilaus, death, his, brother, podarces, took, command, of, his, troops, the, achaeans, besieged, troy, for, nine, years, this, part, of, the, war, is, the, least, developed, among, surviving, sources, which, prefer, to, talk, about, events, in, the, last, year, of, the, war, after, the, initial, landing, the, army, was, gathered, in, its, entirety, again, only, in, the, tenth, year, thucydides, deduces, that, this, was, due, to, lack, of, money, they, raided, the, trojan, allies, and, spent, time, farming, the, thracian, peninsula, troy, was, never, completely, besieged, thus, it, maintained, communications, with, the, interior, of, asia, minor, reinforcements, continued, to, come, until, the, very, end, the, achaeans, controlled, only, the, entrance, to, the, dardanelles, and, troy, and, her, allies, controlled, the, shortest, point, at, abydos, and, sestos, and, communicated, with, allies, in, europe, achilles, and, ajax, were, the, most, active, of, the, achaeans, leading, separate, armies, to, raid, lands, of, trojan, allies, according, to, homer, achilles, conquered, 11, cities, and, 12, islands, according, to, apollodorus, he, raided, the, land, of, aeneas, in, the, tro, d, region, and, stole, his, cattle, he, also, captured, lyrnassus, pedasus, and, many, of, the, neighbouring, cities, and, killed, troilus, it, was, said, that, if, he, reached, 20, years, of, age, troy, would, not, fall, according, to, apollodorus, he, also, took, lesbos, and, phocaea, then, colophon, and, smyrna, and, clazomenae, and, cyme, and, afterwards, aegialus, and, tenos, the, so, called, hundred, cities, then, in, order, adramytium, and, side, then, endium, and, linaeum, and, colone, he, took, also, hypoplacian, thebes, and, lyrnessus, and, further, antandrus, and, many, other, cities, kakrides, comments, that, the, list, is, wrong, in, that, it, extends, too, far, into, the, south, other, sources, talk, of, achilles, taking, pedasus, monenia, mythemna, in, lesbos, and, peisidice, among, the, loot, from, these, cities, was, briseis, from, lyrnessus, who, was, awarded, to, him, and, chryseis, from, hypoplacian, thebes, who, was, awarded, to, agamemnon, achilles, captured, lycaon, son, of, priam, while, he, was, cutting, branches, in, his, father, s, orchards, patroclus, sold, him, as, a, slave, in, lemnos, where, he, was, bought, by, eetion, of, imbros, and, brought, back, to, troy, only, 12, days, later, achilles, slew, him, after, the, death, of, patroclus, ajax, son, of, telamon, laid, waste, the, thracian, peninsula, of, which, polymestor, a, son, in, law, of, priam, was, king, polymestor, surrendered, polydorus, one, of, priam, s, children, of, whom, he, had, custody, he, then, attacked, the, town, of, the, phrygian, king, teleutas, killed, him, in, single, combat, and, carried, off, his, daughter, tecmessa, ajax, also, hunted, the, trojan, flocks, both, on, mount, ida, and, in, the, countryside, numerous, paintings, on, pottery, have, suggested, a, tale, not, mentioned, in, the, literary, traditions, at, some, point, in, the, war, achilles, and, ajax, were, playing, a, board, game, petteia, they, were, absorbed, in, the, game, and, oblivious, to, the, surrounding, battle, the, trojans, attacked, and, reached, the, heroes, who, were, only, saved, by, an, intervention, of, athena, odysseus, was, sent, to, thrace, to, return, with, grain, but, came, back, empty, handed, when, scorned, by, palamedes, odysseus, challenged, him, to, do, better, palamedes, set, out, and, returned, with, a, shipload, of, grain, odysseus, had, never, forgiven, palamedes, for, threatening, the, life, of, his, son, in, revenge, odysseus, conceived, a, plot, where, an, incriminating, letter, was, forged, from, priam, to, palamedes, and, gold, was, planted, in, palamedes, quarters, the, letter, and, gold, were, discovered, and, agamemnon, had, palamedes, stoned, to, death, for, treason, however, pausanias, quoting, the, cypria, says, that, odysseus, and, diomedes, drowned, palamedes, while, he, was, fishing, and, dictys, says, that, odysseus, and, diomedes, lured, palamedes, into, a, well, which, they, said, contained, gold, then, stoned, him, to, death, palamedes, father, nauplius, sailed, to, the, tro, d, and, asked, for, justice, but, was, refused, in, revenge, nauplius, travelled, among, the, achaean, kingdoms, and, told, the, wives, of, the, kings, that, they, were, bringing, trojan, concubines, to, dethrone, them, many, of, the, greek, wives, were, persuaded, to, betray, their, husbands, most, significantly, agamemnon, s, wife, clytemnestra, who, was, seduced, by, aegisthus, son, of, thyestes, near, the, end, of, the, ninth, year, since, the, landing, the, achaean, army, tired, from, the, fighting, and, from, the, lack, of, supplies, mutinied, against, their, leaders, and, demanded, to, return, to, their, homes, according, to, the, cypria, achilles, forced, the, army, to, stay, according, to, apollodorus, agamemnon, brought, the, wine, growers, daughters, of, anius, son, of, apollo, who, had, the, gift, of, producing, by, touch, wine, wheat, and, oil, from, the, earth, in, order, to, relieve, the, supply, problem, of, the, army, chryses, a, priest, of, apollo, and, father, of, chryseis, came, to, agamemnon, to, ask, for, the, return, of, his, daughter, agamemnon, refused, and, insulted, chryses, who, prayed, to, apollo, to, avenge, his, ill, treatment, enraged, apollo, afflicted, the, achaean, army, with, plague, agamemnon, was, forced, to, return, chryseis, to, end, the, plague, and, took, achilles, concubine, briseis, as, his, own, enraged, at, the, dishonour, agamemnon, had, inflicted, upon, him, achilles, decided, he, would, no, longer, fight, he, asked, his, mother, thetis, to, intercede, with, zeus, who, agreed, to, give, the, trojans, success, in, the, absence, of, achilles, the, best, warrior, of, the, achaeans, after, the, withdrawal, of, achilles, the, achaeans, were, initially, successful, both, armies, gathered, in, full, for, the, first, time, since, the, landing, menelaus, and, paris, fought, a, duel, which, ended, when, aphrodite, snatched, the, beaten, paris, from, the, field, with, the, truce, broken, the, armies, began, fighting, again, diomedes, won, great, renown, amongst, the, achaeans, killing, the, trojan, hero, pandaros, and, nearly, killing, aeneas, who, was, only, saved, by, his, mother, aphrodite, with, the, assistance, of, athena, diomedes, then, wounded, the, gods, aphrodite, and, ares, during, the, next, days, however, the, trojans, drove, the, achaeans, back, to, their, camp, and, were, stopped, at, the, achaean, wall, by, poseidon, the, next, day, though, with, zeus, help, the, trojans, broke, into, the, achaean, camp, and, were, on, the, verge, of, setting, fire, to, the, achaean, ships, an, earlier, appeal, to, achilles, to, return, was, rejected, but, after, hector, burned, protesilaus, ship, he, allowed, his, companion, patroclus, to, go, into, battle, wearing, achilles, armour, and, lead, his, army, patroclus, drove, the, trojans, all, the, way, back, to, the, walls, of, troy, and, was, only, prevented, from, storming, the, city, by, the, intervention, of, apollo, patroclus, was, then, killed, by, hector, who, took, achilles, armour, from, the, body, of, patroclus, achilles, maddened, with, grief, over, the, death, of, patroclus, swore, to, kill, hector, in, revenge, the, exact, nature, of, achilles, relationship, to, patroclus, is, the, subject, of, some, debate, although, certainly, very, close, achilles, and, patroclus, are, never, explicitly, cast, as, lovers, by, homer, but, they, were, depicted, as, such, in, the, archaic, and, classical, periods, of, greek, literature, particularly, in, the, works, of, aeschylus, aeschines, and, plato, he, was, reconciled, with, agamemnon, and, received, briseis, back, untouched, by, agamemnon, he, received, a, new, set, of, arms, forged, by, the, god, hephaestus, and, returned, to, the, battlefield, he, slaughtered, many, trojans, and, nearly, killed, aeneas, who, was, saved, by, poseidon, achilles, fought, with, the, river, god, scamander, and, a, battle, of, the, gods, followed, the, trojan, army, returned, to, the, city, except, for, hector, who, remained, outside, the, walls, because, he, was, tricked, by, athena, achilles, killed, hector, and, afterwards, he, dragged, hector, s, body, from, his, chariot, and, refused, to, return, the, body, to, the, trojans, for, burial, the, body, nevertheless, remained, unscathed, as, it, was, preserved, from, all, injury, by, apollo, and, aphrodite, the, achaeans, then, conducted, funeral, games, for, patroclus, afterwards, priam, came, to, achilles, tent, guided, by, hermes, and, asked, achilles, to, return, hector, s, body, the, armies, made, a, temporary, truce, to, allow, the, burial, of, the, dead, the, iliad, ends, with, the, funeral, of, hector, shortly, after, the, burial, of, hector, penthesilea, queen, of, the, amazons, arrived, with, her, warriors, penthesilea, daughter, of, otrera, and, ares, had, accidentally, killed, her, sister, hippolyte, she, was, purified, from, this, action, by, priam, and, in, exchange, she, fought, for, him, and, killed, many, including, machaon, according, to, pausanias, machaon, was, killed, by, eurypylus, and, according, to, one, version, achilles, himself, who, was, resurrected, at, the, request, of, thetis, in, another, version, penthesilia, was, killed, by, achilles, who, would, later, mourn, her, after, her, death, thersites, a, simple, soldier, and, the, ugliest, achaean, taunted, achilles, over, his, grief, and, gouged, out, penthesilea, s, eyes, achilles, slew, thersites, and, after, a, dispute, sailed, to, lesbos, where, he, was, purified, for, his, murder, by, odysseus, after, sacrificing, to, apollo, artemis, and, leto, while, they, were, away, memnon, of, ethiopia, son, of, tithonus, and, eos, came, with, his, host, to, help, his, stepbrother, priam, he, did, not, come, directly, from, ethiopia, but, either, from, susa, in, persia, conquering, all, the, peoples, in, between, or, from, the, caucasus, leading, an, army, of, ethiopians, and, indians, like, achilles, he, wore, armour, made, by, hephaestus, in, the, ensuing, battle, memnon, killed, antilochus, who, took, one, of, memnon, s, blows, to, save, his, father, nestor, achilles, and, memnon, then, fought, zeus, weighed, the, fate, of, the, two, heroes, the, weight, containing, that, of, memnon, sank, and, he, was, slain, by, achilles, achilles, chased, the, trojans, to, their, city, which, he, entered, the, gods, seeing, that, he, had, killed, too, many, of, their, children, decided, that, it, was, his, time, to, die, he, was, killed, after, paris, shot, a, poisoned, arrow, that, was, guided, by, apollo, in, another, version, he, was, killed, by, a, knife, to, the, back, or, heel, by, paris, while, marrying, polyxena, daughter, of, priam, in, the, temple, of, thymbraean, apollo, the, site, where, he, had, earlier, killed, troilus, both, versions, conspicuously, deny, the, killer, any, sort, of, valour, saying, achilles, remained, undefeated, on, the, battlefield, his, bones, were, mingled, with, those, of, patroclus, and, funeral, games, were, held, like, ajax, achilles, is, represented, as, living, after, his, death, in, the, island, of, leuke, at, the, mouth, of, the, danube, river, a, great, battle, raged, around, the, dead, achilles, ajax, held, back, the, trojans, while, odysseus, carried, the, body, away, when, achilles, armour, was, offered, to, the, smartest, warrior, the, two, that, had, saved, his, body, came, forward, as, competitors, agamemnon, unwilling, to, undertake, the, invidious, duty, of, deciding, between, the, two, competitors, referred, the, dispute, to, the, decision, of, the, trojan, prisoners, inquiring, of, them, which, of, the, two, heroes, had, done, most, harm, to, the, trojans, alternatively, the, trojans, and, pallas, athena, were, the, judges, in, that, following, nestor, s, advice, spies, were, sent, to, the, walls, to, overhear, what, was, said, a, girl, said, that, ajax, was, braver, for, aias, took, up, and, carried, out, of, the, strife, the, hero, peleus, son, this, great, odysseus, cared, not, to, do, to, this, another, replied, by, athena, s, contrivance, why, what, is, this, you, say, a, thing, against, reason, and, untrue, even, a, woman, could, carry, a, load, once, a, man, had, put, it, on, her, shoulder, but, she, could, not, fight, for, she, would, fail, with, fear, if, she, should, fight, according, to, pindar, the, decision, was, made, by, secret, ballot, among, the, achaeans, in, all, story, versions, the, arms, were, awarded, to, odysseus, driven, mad, with, grief, ajax, desired, to, kill, his, comrades, but, athena, caused, him, to, mistake, for, the, achaean, warriors, the, cattle, and, their, herdsmen, in, his, frenzy, he, scourged, two, rams, believing, them, to, be, agamemnon, and, menelaus, in, the, morning, he, came, to, his, senses, and, killed, himself, by, jumping, on, the, sword, that, had, been, given, to, him, by, hector, so, that, it, pierced, his, armpit, his, only, vulnerable, part, according, to, an, older, tradition, he, was, killed, by, the, trojans, who, seeing, he, was, invulnerable, attacked, him, with, clay, until, he, was, covered, by, it, and, could, no, longer, move, thus, dying, of, starvation, after, the, tenth, year, it, was, prophesied, that, troy, could, not, fall, without, heracles, bow, which, was, with, philoctetes, in, lemnos, odysseus, and, diomedes, retrieved, philoctetes, whose, wound, had, healed, philoctetes, then, shot, and, killed, paris, according, to, apollodorus, paris, brothers, helenus, and, deiphobus, vied, over, the, hand, of, helen, deiphobus, prevailed, and, helenus, abandoned, troy, for, mount, ida, calchas, said, that, helenus, knew, the, prophecies, concerning, the, fall, of, troy, so, odysseus, waylaid, helenus, under, coercion, helenus, told, the, achaeans, that, they, would, win, if, they, retrieved, pelops, bones, persuaded, achilles, son, neoptolemus, to, fight, for, them, and, stole, the, trojan, palladium, the, greeks, retrieved, pelops, bones, and, sent, odysseus, to, retrieve, neoptolemus, who, was, hiding, from, the, war, in, king, lycomedes, s, court, in, skyros, odysseus, gave, him, his, father, s, arms, eurypylus, son, of, telephus, leading, according, to, homer, a, large, force, of, k, teioi, or, hittites, or, mysians, according, to, apollodorus, arrived, to, aid, the, trojans, eurypylus, killed, machaon, and, peneleos, but, was, slain, by, neoptolemus, disguised, as, a, beggar, odysseus, went, to, spy, inside, troy, but, was, recognised, by, helen, homesick, helen, plotted, with, odysseus, later, with, helen, s, help, odysseus, and, diomedes, stole, the, palladium, the, end, of, the, war, came, with, one, final, plan, odysseus, devised, a, new, ruse, a, giant, hollow, wooden, horse, an, animal, that, was, sacred, to, the, trojans, it, was, built, by, epeius, and, guided, by, athena, from, the, wood, of, a, cornel, tree, grove, sacred, to, apollo, with, the, inscription, the, greeks, dedicate, this, thank, offering, to, athena, for, their, return, home, the, hollow, horse, was, filled, with, soldiers, led, by, odysseus, the, rest, of, the, army, burned, the, camp, and, sailed, for, tenedos, when, the, trojans, discovered, that, the, greeks, were, gone, believing, the, war, was, over, they, joyfully, dragged, the, horse, inside, the, city, while, they, debated, what, to, do, with, it, some, thought, they, ought, to, hurl, it, down, from, the, rocks, others, thought, they, should, burn, it, while, others, said, they, ought, to, dedicate, it, to, athena, both, cassandra, and, laoco, n, warned, against, keeping, the, horse, while, cassandra, had, been, given, the, gift, of, prophecy, by, apollo, she, was, also, cursed, by, apollo, never, to, be, believed, serpents, then, came, out, of, the, sea, and, devoured, either, laoco, n, and, one, of, his, two, sons, laoco, n, and, both, his, sons, or, only, his, sons, a, portent, which, so, alarmed, the, followers, of, aeneas, that, they, withdrew, to, ida, the, trojans, decided, to, keep, the, horse, and, turned, to, a, night, of, mad, revelry, and, celebration, sinon, an, achaean, spy, signalled, the, fleet, stationed, at, tenedos, when, it, was, midnight, and, the, clear, moon, was, rising, and, the, soldiers, from, inside, the, horse, emerged, and, killed, the, guards, the, achaeans,

their, alien, helpers, died, here, were, men, lying, quelled, by, bitter, death, all, up, and, down, the, city, in, their, blood, the, trojans, fuelled, with, desperation, fought, back, fiercely, despite, being, disorganised, and, leaderless, with, the, fighting, at, its, height, some, donned, fallen, enemies, attire, and, launched, surprise, counterattacks, in, the, chaotic, street, fighting, other, defenders, hurled, down, roof, tiles, and, anything, else, heavy, down, on, the, rampaging, attackers, the, outlook, was, grim, though, and, eventually, the, remaining, defenders, were, destroyed, along, with, the, whole, city, neoptolemus, killed, priam, who, had, taken, refuge, at, the, altar, of, zeus, of, the, courtyard, menelaus, killed, deiphobus, helen, s, husband, after,

while, she, was, clinging, to, her, statue, because, of, ajax, s, impiety, the, acheaens, urged, by, odysseus, wanted, to, stone, him, to, death, but, he, fled, to, athena, s, altar, and, was, spared, antenor, who, had, given, hospitality, to, menelaus, and, odysseus, when, they, asked, for, the, return, of, helen, and, who, had, advocated, so, was, spared, along, with, his, family, aeneas, took,

and, andromache, but, decline, to, remain, after, seven, years, they, arrive, in, carthage, where, aeneas, has, an, affair, with, queen, dido, since, according, to, tradition, carthage, was, founded,

the, long, enmity, between, rome, and, carthage, that, expressed, itself, in, the, punic, wars, and, led, to, roman, hegemony, at, cumae, the, sibyl, leads, aeneas, on, an, archetypal, descent, to,

claudian, dynasty, since, this, war, was, considered, among, the, ancient, greeks, as, either, the, last, event, of, the, mythical, age, or, the, first, event, of, the, historical, age, several,

describes, was, believed, to, be, troy, vi, by, many, twentieth, century, ad, authors, and, destroyed, about, 1275, bc, probably, by, an, earthquake, its, successor, troy, viia, was, destroyed, around, 1180, bc, it, was, long, considered, a, poorer, city, and, dismissed, as, a, candidate, for, homeric, troy, but, since, the, excavation, campaign, of, 1988, it, has, come, to, be, regarded, as, the, most, likely, candidate, the, historicity, of, the, trojan, war, including, whether, it, occurred, at, all, and, where, troy, was, located, if, it, ever, existed, is, still, subject, to, debate, most, classical, greeks, thought, that, the, war, was, a, historical, event, but, many, believed, that, the, homeric, poems, had, exaggerated, the, events, to, suit, the, demands, of, poetry, for, instance, the, historian, thucydides, who, is, known, for, being, critical, considers, it, a, true, event, but, doubts, that, 1, 186, ships, were, sent, to, troy, euripides, started, changing, greek, myths, at, will, including, those, of, the, trojan, war, near, ad, 100, dio, chrysostom, argued, that, while, the, war, was, historical, it, ended, with, the, trojans, winning, and, the, greeks, attempted, to, hide, that, fact, around, 1870, it, was, generally, agreed, in, western, europe, that, the, trojan, war, had, never, happened, and, troy, never, existed, then, heinrich, schliemann, popularised, his, excavations, at, hisarl, k, anakkale, which, he, and, others, believed, to, be, troy, and, of, the, mycenaean, cities, of, greece, today, many, scholars, agree, that, the, trojan, war, is, based, on, a, historical, core, of, a, greek, expedition, against, the, city, of, troy, but, few, would, argue, that, the, homeric, poems, faithfully, represent, the, actual, events, of, the, war, in, november, 2001, geologist, john, c, kraft, and, classicist, john, v, luce, presented, the, results, of, investigations, into, the, geology, of, the, region, that, had, started, in, 1977, the, geologists, compared, the, present, geology, with, the, landscapes, and, coastal, features, described, in, the, iliad, and, other, classical, sources, notably, strabo, s, geographica, their, conclusion, was, that, there, is, regularly, a, consistency, between, the, location, of, troy, as, identified, by, schliemann, and, other, locations, such, as, the, greek, camp, the, geological, evidence, and, descriptions, of, the, topography, and, accounts, of, the, battle, in, the, iliad, although, of, course, this, could, be, a, coincidence, since, the, twentieth, century, scholars, have, attempted, to, draw, conclusions, based, on, hittite, and, egyptian, texts, that, date, to, the, time, of, the, trojan, war, while, they, give, a, general, description, of, the, political, situation, in, the, region, at, the, time, their, information, on, whether, this, particular, conflict, took, place, is, limited, andrew, dalby, notes, that, while, the, trojan, war, most, likely, did, take, place, in, some, form, and, is, therefore, grounded, in, history, its, true, nature, is, unknown, the, tawagalawa, letter, mentions, a, kingdom, of, ahhiyawa, achaea, or, greece, that, lies, beyond, the, sea, that, would, be, the, aegean, and, controls, milliwanda, which, is, identified, with, miletus, also, mentioned, in, this, and, other, letters, is, the, assuwa, confederation, made, of, 22, cities, and, countries, which, included, the, city, of, wilusa, ilios, or, ilium, the, milawata, letter, implies, this, city, lies, on, the, north, of, the, assuwa, confederation, beyond, the, seha, river, while, the, identification, of, wilusa, with, ilium, that, is, troy, is, always, controversial, in, the, 1990s, it, gained, majority, acceptance, in, the, alaksandu, treaty, c, 1280, bc, the, king, of, the, city, is, named, alaksandu, and, paris, s, name, in, the, iliad, among, other, works, is, alexander, the, tawagalawa, letter, dated, c, 1250, bc, which, is, addressed, to, the, king, of, ahhiyawa, actually, says, now, as, we, have, reached, agreement, on, the, matter, of, wilusa, over, which, we, went, to, war, formerly, under, the, hittites, the, assuwa, confederation, defected, after, the, battle, of, kadesh, between, egypt, and, the, hittites, c, 1274, bc, in, 1230, bc, hittite, king, tudhaliya, iv, c, 1240, 1210, bc, campaigned, against, this, federation, under, arnuwanda, iii, c, 1210, 1205, bc, the, hittites, were, forced, to, abandon, the, lands, they, controlled, in, the, coast, of, the, aegean, it, is, possible, that, the, trojan, war, was, a, conflict, between, the, king, of, ahhiyawa, and, the, assuwa, confederation, this, view, has, been, supported, in, that, the, entire, war, includes, the, landing, in, mysia, and, telephus, wounding, achilles, s, campaigns, in, the, north, aegean, and, telamonian, ajax, s, campaigns, in, thrace, and, phrygia, most, of, these, regions, were, part, of, assuwa, that, most, achaean, heroes, did, not, return, to, their, homes, and, founded, colonies, elsewhere, was, interpreted, by, thucydides, as, being, due, to, their, long, absence, nowadays, the, interpretation, followed, by, most, scholars, is, that, the, achaean, leaders, driven, out, of, their, lands, by, the, turmoil, at, the, end, of, the, mycenaean, era, preferred, to, claim, descent, from, exiles, of, the, trojan, war, the, inspiration, provided, by, these, events, produced, many, literary, works, far, more, than, can, be, listed, here, the, siege, of, troy, provided, inspiration, for, many, works, of, art, most, famously, homer, s, iliad, set, in, the, last, year, of, the, siege, some, of, the, others, include, tro, des, by, euripides, troilus, and, criseyde, by, geoffrey, chaucer, troilus, and, cressida, by, william, shakespeare, iphigenia, and, polyxena, by, samuel, coster, palamedes, by, joost, van, den, vondel, and, les, troyens, by, hector, berlioz, films, based, on, the, trojan, war, include, helen, of, troy, 1956, the, trojan, horse, 1961, and, troy, 2004, the, war, has, also, been, featured, in, many, books, television, series, and, other, creative, works
