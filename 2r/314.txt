the, anglo, saxons, in, some, contexts, simply, called, saxons, or, the, english, were, a, cultural, group, who, spoke, old, english, and, inhabited, much, of, what, is, now, england, and, south, eastern, scotland, in, the, early, middle, ages, they, traced, their, origins, to, germanic, settlers, who, became, one, of, the, most, important, cultural, groups, in, britain, by, the, 5th, century, the, anglo, saxon, period, in, britain, is, considered, to, have, started, by, about, 450, and, ended, in, 1066, with, the, norman, conquest, although, the, details, of, their, early, settlement, and, political, development, are, not, clear, by, the, 8th, century, a, single, anglo, saxon, cultural, identity, which, was, generally, called, englisc, had, developed, out, of, the, interaction, of, these, settlers, with, the, pre, existing, romano, british, culture, by, 1066, most, of, the, people, of, what, is, now, england, spoke, old, english, and, were, considered, english, viking, and, norman, invasions, changed, the, politics, and, culture, of, england, significantly, but, the, overarching, anglo, saxon, identity, evolved, and, remained, dominant, even, after, the, norman, conquest, late, anglo, saxon, political, structures, and, language, are, the, direct, predecessors, of, the, high, medieval, kingdom, of, england, and, the, middle, english, language, although, the, modern, english, language, owes, less, than, 26, of, its, words, to, old, english, this, includes, the, vast, majority, of, everyday, words, in, the, early, 8th, century, the, earliest, detailed, account, of, anglo, saxon, origins, was, given, by, bede, d, 735, suggesting, that, they, were, long, divided, into, smaller, regional, kingdoms, each, with, differing, accounts, of, their, continental, origins, as, a, collective, term, the, compound, term, anglo, saxon, commonly, used, by, modern, historians, for, the, period, before, 1066, first, appears, in, bede, s, time, but, it, was, probably, not, widely, used, until, modern, times, bede, was, one, of, the, first, writers, to, prefer, angles, or, english, as, the, collective, term, and, this, eventually, became, dominant, bede, like, other, authors, also, sometimes, used, the, collective, term, saxons, especially, when, referring, to, the, earliest, periods, of, settlement, roman, and, british, writers, of, the, 3rd, to, 6th, century, had, described, the, earliest, saxons, as, north, sea, raiders, however, despite, also, being, used, this, way, as, collective, terms, in, britain, according, to, bede, the, saxons, and, angles, had, originally, been, distinctive, but, neighbouring, peoples, in, germania, anglo, saxon, material, culture, can, be, seen, in, architecture, dress, styles, illuminated, texts, metalwork, and, other, art, behind, the, symbolic, nature, of, these, cultural, emblems, there, are, strong, elements, of, tribal, and, lordship, ties, the, elite, declared, themselves, kings, who, developed, burhs, fortifications, and, fortified, settlements, and, identified, their, roles, and, peoples, in, biblical, terms, above, all, as, archaeologist, helena, hamerow, has, observed, local, and, extended, kin, groups, remained, the, essential, unit, of, production, throughout, the, anglo, saxon, period, in, modern, times, the, term, anglo, saxons, is, used, by, scholars, to, refer, collectively, to, the, old, english, speaking, groups, in, britain, as, a, compound, term, it, has, the, advantage, of, covering, the, various, english, speaking, groups, on, the, one, hand, and, to, avoid, possible, misunderstandings, from, using, the, terms, saxons, or, angles, english, both, of, which, terms, could, be, used, either, as, collectives, referring, to, all, the, old, english, speakers, or, to, specific, tribal, groups, although, the, term, anglo, saxon, was, not, used, as, a, common, term, until, modern, times, it, is, not, a, modern, invention, because, it, was, also, used, in, some, specific, contexts, already, between, the, 8th, and, 10th, centuries, before, the, 8th, century, the, most, common, collective, term, for, the, old, english, speakers, was, saxons, which, was, a, word, originally, associated, since, the, 4th, century, not, with, a, specific, country, or, nation, but, with, raiders, in, north, sea, coastal, areas, of, britain, and, gaul, an, especially, early, reference, to, the, angli, is, the, 6th, century, byzantine, historian, procopius, who, however, expressed, doubts, about, the, stories, he, had, heard, about, events, in, the, west, which, he, apparently, heard, through, frankish, diplomats, he, never, mentions, the, saxons, but, he, states, that, an, island, called, brittia, which, was, supposedly, distinct, from, britain, itself, was, settled, by, three, nations, the, angili, frissones, and, brittones, each, ruled, by, its, own, king, each, nation, was, so, prolific, that, it, sent, large, numbers, of, individuals, every, year, to, the, franks, who, planted, them, in, unpopulated, regions, of, their, territory, by, the, 8th, century, the, saxons, in, germany, were, seen, as, a, country, and, writers, such, as, bede, and, some, of, his, contemporaries, including, alcuin, and, saint, boniface, began, to, refer, to, the, overall, group, in, britain, as, the, english, people, latin, angli, gens, anglorum, or, old, english, angelcynn, in, bede, s, work, the, term, saxon, is, also, used, to, refer, sometimes, to, the, old, english, language, and, also, to, refer, to, the, early, pagan, anglo, saxons, before, the, arrival, of, christian, missionaries, among, the, anglo, saxons, of, kent, in, 597, the, term, saxon, on, the, other, hand, was, at, this, time, increasingly, used, by, mainland, writers, to, designate, specific, northern, neighbours, of, the, frankish, kingdom, of, austrasia, bede, therefore, called, these, the, old, saxons, antiqui, saxones, and, he, noted, that, there, was, no, longer, any, country, of, angles, in, germany, as, it, had, become, empty, due, to, emigration, similarly, a, non, anglo, saxon, contemporary, of, bede, paul, the, deacon, referred, variously, to, either, the, english, angli, or, anglo, saxons, latin, plural, genitives, saxonum, anglorum, or, anglorum, saxonum, which, helped, him, distinguish, them, from, the, european, saxons, who, he, also, discussed, in, england, itself, this, compound, term, also, came, to, be, used, in, some, specific, situations, both, in, latin, and, old, english, alfred, the, great, himself, a, west, saxon, was, for, example, anglosaxonum, rex, in, the, late, 880s, probably, indicating, that, he, was, literally, a, king, over, both, english, for, example, mercian, and, saxon, kingdoms, however, the, term, english, continued, to, be, used, as, a, common, collective, term, and, indeed, became, dominant, the, increased, use, of, these, new, collective, terms, english, or, anglo, saxon, represents, the, strengthening, of, the, idea, of, a, single, unifying, cultural, unity, among, the, anglo, saxons, themselves, who, had, previously, invested, in, identities, which, differentiated, various, regional, groups, in, contrast, irish, and, welsh, speakers, long, continued, to, refer, to, anglo, saxons, as, saxons, the, word, saeson, is, the, modern, welsh, word, for, english, people, the, equivalent, word, in, scottish, gaelic, is, sasannach, and, in, the, irish, language, sasanach, catherine, hills, suggests, that, it, is, no, accident, that, the, english, call, themselves, by, the, name, sanctified, by, the, church, as, that, of, a, people, chosen, by, god, whereas, their, enemies, use, the, name, originally, applied, to, piratical, raiders, although, it, involved, immigrant, communities, from, northern, europe, the, culture, of, the, anglo, saxons, was, not, transplanted, from, there, but, rather, developed, in, britain, in, 400, the, roman, province, of, britannia, had, long, been, part, of, the, roman, empire, although, the, empire, had, been, dismembered, several, times, during, the, previous, centuries, often, because, of, usurpations, beginning, in, britain, such, as, those, of, magnus, maximus, and, constantine, iii, there, was, an, overall, continuity, and, interconnectedness, already, before, 400, roman, sources, used, the, term, saxons, to, refer, to, coastal, raiders, who, had, been, causing, problems, especially, on, the, coasts, of, the, north, sea, in, what, is, now, south, eastern, england, the, romans, established, a, military, commander, who, was, assigned, to, oversee, a, chain, of, coastal, forts, which, they, called, the, saxon, shore, the, homeland, of, these, saxon, raiders, was, not, clearly, described, in, surviving, sources, but, they, were, apparently, the, northerly, neighbours, of, the, franks, on, the, lower, rhine, at, the, same, time, the, roman, administration, in, britain, and, other, parts, of, the, empire, was, recruiting, foederati, soldiers, from, the, same, general, regions, in, what, is, now, germany, and, these, are, likely, to, have, become, more, important, after, the, withdrawal, of, field, armies, during, internal, roman, power, struggles, according, to, the, chronica, gallica, of, 452, britain, was, ravaged, by, saxon, invaders, in, 409, or, 410, this, was, only, a, few, years, after, constantine, iii, was, declared, roman, emperor, in, britain, and, during, the, period, that, he, was, still, leading, british, roman, forces, in, rebellion, on, the, continent, the, rebellion, was, soon, quashed, the, romano, british, citizens, reportedly, expelled, constantine, s, imperial, officials, during, this, period, but, they, never, again, received, new, roman, officials, or, military, forces, writing, in, the, mid, sixth, century, procopius, states, that, after, the, death, of, constantine, iii, in, 411, the, romans, never, succeeded, in, recovering, britain, but, it, remained, from, that, time, under, tyrants, the, romano, britons, nevertheless, called, upon, the, empire, to, help, them, fend, off, attacks, from, not, only, the, saxons, but, also, the, picts, and, scoti, a, hagiography, of, saint, germanus, of, auxerre, claims, that, he, helped, command, a, defence, against, an, invasion, of, picts, and, saxons, in, 429, by, about, 430, the, archaeological, record, in, britain, begins, to, indicate, a, relatively, rapid, melt, down, of, roman, material, culture, and, its, replacement, by, anglo, saxon, material, culture, at, some, time, between, 445, and, 454, gildas, one, of, the, only, writers, in, this, period, reported, that, the, britons, also, wrote, to, the, roman, military, leader, a, tius, in, gaul, begging, for, assistance, with, no, success, in, desperation, an, un, named, proud, tyrant, at, some, point, invited, saxons, as, foederati, soldiers, to, britain, to, help, defend, it, from, the, picts, and, scots, he, did, not, report, the, year, and, later, writers, developed, different, estimates, of, when, this, occurred, possibly, referring, to, this, same, event, the, chronica, gallica, of, 452, records, for, the, year, 441, the, british, provinces, which, to, this, time, had, suffered, various, defeats, and, misfortunes, are, reduced, to, saxon, rule, bede, writing, centuries, later, reasoned, that, this, happened, in, 450, 455, and, he, named, the, proud, tyrant, as, vortigern, however, the, date, could, have, been, significantly, earlier, and, bede, s, understanding, of, these, events, has, been, questioned, the, historia, brittonum, written, in, the, 9th, century, gives, two, different, years, but, the, writer, apparently, believed, it, happened, in, 428, another, 9th, century, source, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, is, largely, based, on, bede, but, says, this, saxon, arrival, happened, in, 449, the, archaeological, evidence, suggests, an, earlier, timescale, in, particular, the, work, of, catherine, hills, and, sam, lucy, on, the, evidence, of, spong, hill, has, moved, the, chronology, for, the, settlement, earlier, than, 450, with, a, significant, number, of, items, now, in, phases, before, bede, s, date, historian, guy, halsall, has, even, speculated, that, gildas, was, badly, misread, by, bede, and, all, subsequent, historians, and, that, the, invitation, of, the, foederati, was, part, of, a, military, reorganization, in, the, time, of, magnus, maximus, in, the, late, 4th, century, bede, whose, report, of, this, period, is, partly, based, on, gildas, believed, that, the, call, was, answered, by, kings, from, three, powerful, tribes, from, germania, angles, saxons, and, jutes, the, saxons, came, from, old, saxony, on, the, north, sea, coast, of, germany, and, settled, in, wessex, sussex, and, essex, jutland, the, peninsula, containing, part, of, denmark, was, the, homeland, of, the, jutes, who, settled, in, kent, and, the, isle, of, wight, the, angles, or, english, were, from, anglia, a, country, which, bede, understood, to, have, now, been, emptied, and, which, lay, between, the, homelands, of, the, saxons, and, jutes, anglia, is, usually, interpreted, as, the, old, schleswig, holstein, province, straddling, the, modern, danish, german, border, and, containing, the, modern, angeln, although, this, represents, a, turning, point, the, continental, ancestors, of, the, anglo, saxons, were, probably, quite, diverse, and, they, arrived, over, a, longer, period, in, another, passage, bede, named, pagan, peoples, still, living, in, germany, germania, in, the, eighth, century, from, whom, the, angles, or, saxons, who, now, inhabit, britain, are, known, to, have, derived, their, origin, for, which, reason, they, are, still, corruptly, called, garmans, by, the, neighbouring, nation, of, the, britons, the, frisians, the, rugini, the, danes, the, huns, avars, in, this, period, the, old, saxons, and, the, boructuarii, who, are, presumed, to, be, inhabitants, of, the, old, lands, of, the, bructeri, near, the, lippe, river, 123, 124, gildas, reported, that, a, war, broke, out, between, the, saxons, and, the, local, population, who, joined, forces, under, a, person, named, ambrosius, aurelianus, historian, nick, higham, calls, it, the, war, of, the, saxon, federates, unlike, bede, and, later, writers, who, followed, him, for, whom, this, war, turned, into, a, very, long, war, between, two, nations, which, was, eventually, won, by, the, descendants, of, the, saxons, gildas, reported, that, by, the, time, he, was, born, this, war, ended, successfully, for, the, britons, after, the, siege, at, mons, badonicus, the, price, of, peace, higham, argues, must, have, been, a, better, treaty, for, the, saxons, giving, them, the, ability, to, receive, tribute, from, people, across, the, lowlands, of, britain, gildas, himself, did, not, mention, the, defeated, saxons, as, an, ongoing, problem, but, instead, he, noted, that, the, britons, had, become, divided, into, many, small, tyrannies, his, interest, was, in, criticizing, the, romano, british, ruling, class, whereas, archaeological, evidence, shows, that, anglo, saxon, culture, had, long, become, dominant, over, much, of, britain, historians, who, accept, bede, s, understanding, interpret, gildas, as, ignoring, a, large, part, of, britain, and, writing, about, romano, british, kingdoms, which, had, been, limited, to, the, north, and, west, other, historians, have, argued, that, in, the, 5th, century, many, romano, british, people, must, have, adopted, the, new, culture, which, we, now, call, anglo, saxon, even, when, they, did, not, have, germanic, ancestry, or, rulers, unfortunately, there, are, very, few, written, sources, apart, from, gildas, until, the, conversion, of, the, anglo, saxons, to, christianity, which, began, in, the, late, 6th, century, one, eastern, contemporary, of, gildas, procopius, reported, a, story, which, was, apparently, relayed, to, him, by, frankish, diplomats, that, an, island, called, brittia, which, faced, the, rhine, was, divided, but, between, three, peoples, the, britons, anglii, and, frisians, much, later, thelberht, of, kent, died, 616, invited, missionaries, from, the, pope, and, married, a, merovingian, bride, and, is, one, of, the, first, anglo, saxon, rulers, who, can, be, identified, with, some, confidence, bede, portrayed, thelberht, as, a, descendant, of, the, original, group, of, saxons, mentioned, by, gildas, unfortunately, the, king, lists, and, genealogies, produced, by, bede, and, later, writers, are, not, considered, reliable, for, these, early, centuries, a, 2022, genetic, study, used, modern, and, ancient, dna, samples, from, england, and, neighbouring, countries, to, study, the, question, of, physical, anglo, saxon, migration, and, concluded, that, there, was, large, scale, immigration, of, both, men, and, women, into, eastern, england, from, a, north, continental, population, matching, early, medieval, people, from, the, area, stretching, from, northern, netherlands, through, northern, germany, to, denmark, this, began, already, in, the, roman, era, and, then, increased, rapidly, in, the, 5th, century, the, burial, evidence, showed, that, the, locals, and, immigrants, were, being, buried, together, using, the, same, new, customs, and, that, they, were, having, mixed, children, the, authors, estimate, the, effective, contributions, to, modern, english, ancestry, are, between, 25, and, 47, north, continental, 11, and, 57, british, iron, age, and, 14, and, 43, was, attributed, to, a, more, stretched, out, migration, into, southern, england, from, nearby, populations, such, as, modern, belgium, and, france, there, were, significant, regional, variations, in, north, continental, ancestry, lower, in, the, west, and, highest, in, sussex, the, east, midlands, and, east, anglia, from, the, time, of, the, christian, conversions, the, first, well, attested, english, kings, and, kingdoms, appear, in, the, written, record, this, situation, with, a, small, number, of, kingdoms, competing, for, dominance, is, traditionally, called, the, heptarchy, which, indicates, a, period, of, seven, kingdoms, there, were, however, more, than, seven, kingdoms, and, their, interactions, were, quite, complex, in, 595, augustine, landed, on, the, isle, of, thanet, and, proceeded, to, king, thelberht, s, main, town, of, canterbury, he, had, been, sent, by, pope, gregory, the, great, to, lead, the, gregorian, mission, to, britain, to, christianise, the, kingdom, of, kent, from, their, native, anglo, saxon, paganism, kent, was, probably, chosen, because, thelberht, had, married, a, christian, princess, bertha, daughter, of, charibert, i, the, king, of, paris, who, was, expected, to, exert, some, influence, over, her, husband, thelberht, in, kent, was, later, seen, by, bede, as, the, third, king, to, have, imperium, over, the, english, south, of, the, humber, having, replaced, ceawlin, of, wessex, died, about, 593, and, before, this, generation, there, are, only, semi, mythical, accounts, of, earlier, kings, thelberht, s, law, for, kent, the, earliest, written, code, in, any, germanic, language, instituted, a, complex, system, of, fines, kent, was, rich, with, strong, trade, ties, to, the, continent, and, thelberht, may, have, instituted, royal, control, over, trade, for, the, first, time, following, the, anglo, saxon, invasion, coins, began, circulating, in, kent, during, his, reign, his, son, in, law, s, berht, of, essex, also, converted, to, christianity, after, thelberht, s, death, in, about, 616, 618, the, most, powerful, king, was, r, dwald, of, east, anglia, who, also, gave, christianity, a, foothold, in, his, kingdom, and, helped, to, install, of, edwin, of, northumbria, who, replaced, thelfrith, to, become, the, second, king, over, the, two, kingdoms, north, of, the, humber, bernicia, and, deira, after, r, dwald, died, cadwallon, ap, cadfan, the, king, of, gwynedd, in, alliance, with, king, penda, of, mercia, killed, edwin, in, battle, at, hatfield, chase, thelfrith, s, son, oswald, subsequently, became, the, third, king, of, northumbria, although, not, included, in, bede, s, list, of, rulers, with, imperium, penda, defeated, and, killed, oswald, in, 642, and, was, the, dominant, king, of, the, english, until, he, was, himself, killed, in, battle, against, oswald, s, brother, oswiu, in, 655, oswiu, remained, the, dominant, king, of, england, until, he, died, in, 670, in, 635, aidan, an, irish, monk, from, iona, chose, the, isle, of, lindisfarne, to, establish, a, monastery, which, was, close, to, king, oswald, s, main, fortress, of, bamburgh, he, had, been, at, the, monastery, in, iona, when, oswald, asked, to, be, sent, a, mission, to, christianise, the, kingdom, of, northumbria, from, their, native, anglo, saxon, paganism, oswald, had, probably, chosen, iona, because, after, his, father, had, been, killed, he, had, fled, into, south, west, scotland, and, had, encountered, christianity, and, had, returned, determined, to, make, northumbria, christian, aidan, achieved, great, success, in, spreading, the, christian, faith, in, the, north, and, since, aidan, could, not, speak, english, and, oswald, had, learned, irish, during, his, exile, oswald, acted, as, aidan, s, interpreter, when, the, latter, was, preaching, later, northumberland, s, patron, saint, saint, cuthbert, was, an, abbot, of, the, monastery, and, then, bishop, of, lindisfarne, an, anonymous, life, of, cuthbert, written, at, lindisfarne, is, the, oldest, extant, piece, of, english, historical, writing, and, in, his, memory, a, gospel, known, as, the, st, cuthbert, gospel, was, placed, in, his, coffin, the, decorated, leather, bookbinding, is, the, oldest, intact, european, binding, in, 664, the, synod, of, whitby, was, convened, and, established, roman, practice, as, opposed, to, irish, practice, in, style, of, tonsure, and, dates, of, easter, as, the, norm, in, northumbria, and, thus, brought, the, northumbrian, church, into, the, mainstream, of, roman, culture, the, episcopal, seat, of, northumbria, was, transferred, from, lindisfarne, to, york, wilfrid, chief, advocate, for, the, roman, position, later, became, bishop, of, northumbria, while, colm, n, and, the, ionan, supporters, who, did, not, change, their, practices, withdrew, to, iona, wilfred, also, influenced, kings, to, the, south, who, were, under, the, dominance, of, oswiu, such, as, the, son, of, penda, wulfhere, of, mercia, died, 675, who, converted, to, christianity, and, eventually, recovered, control, over, mercia, and, eventually, expanded, his, dominance, over, most, of, england, beginning, a, long, period, of, mercian, supremacy, by, 660, the, political, map, of, lowland, britain, had, developed, with, smaller, territories, coalescing, into, kingdoms, and, from, this, time, larger, kingdoms, started, dominating, the, smaller, kingdoms, the, development, of, kingdoms, with, a, particular, king, being, recognised, as, an, overlord, developed, out, of, an, early, loose, structure, that, higham, believes, is, linked, back, to, the, original, feodus, the, traditional, name, for, this, period, is, the, heptarchy, which, has, not, been, used, by, scholars, since, the, early, 20th, century, as, it, gives, the, impression, of, a, single, political, structure, and, does, not, afford, the, opportunity, to, treat, the, history, of, any, one, kingdom, as, a, whole, simon, keynes, suggests, that, the, 8th, and, 9th, century, was, a, period, of, economic, and, social, flourishing, which, created, stability, both, below, the, thames, and, above, the, humber, middle, lowland, britain, was, known, as, the, place, of, the, mierce, the, border, or, frontier, folk, in, latin, mercia, mercia, was, a, diverse, area, of, tribal, groups, as, shown, by, the, tribal, hidage, the, peoples, were, a, mixture, of, brittonic, speaking, peoples, and, anglo, saxon, pioneers, and, their, early, leaders, had, brittonic, names, such, as, penda, although, penda, does, not, appear, in, bede, s, list, of, great, overlords, it, would, appear, from, what, bede, says, elsewhere, that, he, was, dominant, over, the, southern, kingdoms, at, the, time, of, the, battle, of, the, river, winw, d, thirty, duces, regii, royal, generals, fought, on, his, behalf, although, there, are, many, gaps, in, the, evidence, it, is, clear, that, the, seventh, century, mercian, kings, were, formidable, rulers, who, were, able, to, exercise, a, wide, ranging, overlordship, from, their, midland, base, mercian, military, success, was, the, basis, of, their, power, it, succeeded, against, not, only, 106, kings, and, kingdoms, by, winning, set, piece, battles, but, by, ruthlessly, ravaging, any, area, foolish, enough, to, withhold, tribute, there, are, a, number, of, casual, references, scattered, throughout, the, bede, s, history, to, this, aspect, of, mercian, military, policy, penda, is, found, ravaging, northumbria, as, far, north, as, bamburgh, and, only, a,

century, the, most, powerful, european, ruler, of, the, age, the, frankish, king, charlemagne, recognised, the, mercian, king, offa, s, power, and, accordingly, treated, him, with, respect, even, if, this, could, have, been, just, flattery, michael, drout, calls, this, period, the, golden, age, when, learning, flourished, with, a, renaissance, in, classical, knowledge, the, growth, and,

originally, from, tarsus, in, asia, minor, arrived, in, britain, to, become, the, eighth, archbishop, of, canterbury, he, was, joined, the, following, year, by, his, colleague, hadrian, a, latin, speaking, african, by, origin, and, former, abbot, of, a, monastery, in, campania, near, naples, one, of, their, first, tasks, at, canterbury, was, the, establishment, of, a, school, and, according, to, bede, writing, some, sixty, years, later, they, soon, attracted, a, crowd, of, students, into, whose, minds, they, daily, poured, the, streams, of, wholesome, learning, as, evidence, of, their, teaching, bede, reports, that, some, of, their, students, who, survived, to, his, own, day, were, as, fluent, in, greek, and, latin, as, in, their, native, language, bede, does, not, mention, aldhelm, in, this, connection, but, we, know, from, a, letter, addressed, by, aldhelm, to, hadrian, that, he, too, must, be, numbered, among, their, students, aldhelm, wrote, in, elaborate, and, grandiloquent, and, very, difficult, latin, which, became, the, dominant, style, for, centuries, michael, drout, states, aldhelm, wrote, latin, hexameters, better, than, anyone, before, in, england, and, possibly, better, than, anyone, since, or, at, least, up, until, john, milton, his, work, showed, that, scholars, in, england, at, the, very, edge, of, europe, could, be, as, learned, and, sophisticated, as, any, writers, in, europe, during, this, period, the, wealth, and, power, of, the, monasteries, increased, as, elite, families, possibly, out, of, power, turned, to, monastic, life, anglo, saxon,

living, separate, lives, of, celibacy, these, double, monasteries, were, presided, over, by, abbesses, who, became, some, of, the, most, powerful, and, influential, women, in, europe, double, monasteries, which, were, built, on, strategic, sites, near, rivers, and, coasts, accumulated, immense, wealth, and, power, over, multiple, generations, their, inheritances, were, not, divided, and, became, centers, of, art, and, learning, while, aldhelm, was, doing, his, work, in, malmesbury, far, from, him, up, in, the, north, of, england, bede, was, writing, a, large, quantity, of, books, gaining, a, reputation, in, europe, and, showing, that, the, english, could, write, history, and, theology, and, do, astronomical, computation, for, the, dates, of, easter, among, other, things, during, the, 9th, century, wessex, rose, in, power, from, the, foundations, laid, by, king, egbert, in, the, first, quarter, of, the, century, to, the, achievements, of, king, alfred, the, great, in, its, closing, decades, the, outlines, of, the, story, are, told, in, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, though, the, annals, represent, a, west, saxon, point, of, view, on, the, day, of, egbert, s, succession, to, the, kingdom, of, wessex, in, 802, a, mercian, ealdorman, from, the, province, of, the, hwicce, had, crossed, the, border, at, kempsford, with, the, intention, of, mounting, a, raid, into, northern, wiltshire, the, mercian, force, was, met, by, the, local, ealdorman, and, the, people, of, wiltshire, had, the, victory, in, 829, egbert, went, on, the, chronicler, reports, to, conquer, the, kingdom, of, the, mercians, and, everything, south, of, the, humber, it, was, at, this, point, that, the, chronicler, chooses, to, attach, egbert, s, name, to, bede, s, list, of, seven, overlords, adding, that, he, was, the, eighth, king, who, was, bretwalda, simon, keynes, suggests, egbert, s, foundation, of, a, bipartite, kingdom, is, crucial, as, it, stretched, across, southern, england, and, it, created, a, working, alliance, between, the, west, saxon, dynasty, and, the, rulers, of, the, mercians, in, 860, the, eastern, and, western, parts, of, the, southern, kingdom, were, united, by, agreement, between, the, surviving, sons, of, king, thelwulf, though, the, union, was, not, maintained, without, some, opposition, from, within, the, dynasty, and, in, the, late, 870s, king, alfred, gained, the, submission, of, the, mercians, under, their, ruler, thelred, who, in, other, circumstances, might, have, been, styled, a, king, but, who, under, the, alfredian, regime, was, regarded, as, the, ealdorman, of, his, people, the, wealth, of, the, monasteries, and, the, success, of, anglo, saxon, society, attracted, the, attention, of, people, from, mainland, europe, mostly, danes, and, norwegians, because, of, the, plundering, raids, that, followed, the, raiders, attracted, the, name, viking, from, the, old, norse, v, kingr, meaning, an, expedition, which, soon, became, used, for, the, raiding, activity, or, piracy, reported, in, western, europe, in, 793, lindisfarne, was, raided, and, while, this, was, not, the, first, raid, of, its, type, it, was, the, most, prominent, in, 794, jarrow, the, monastery, where, bede, wrote, was, attacked, in, 795, iona, in, scotland, was, attacked, and, in, 804, the, nunnery, at, lyminge, in, kent, was, granted, refuge, inside, the, walls, of, canterbury, sometime, around, 800, a, reeve, from, portland, in, wessex, was, killed, when, he, mistook, some, raiders, for, ordinary, traders, viking, raids, continued, until, in, 850, then, the, chronicle, says, the, heathen, for, the, first, time, remained, over, the, winter, the, fleet, does, not, appear, to, have, stayed, long, in, england, but, it, started, a, trend, which, others, subsequently, followed, in, particular, the, army, which, arrived, in, 865, remained, over, many, winters, and, part, of, it, later, settled, what, became, known, as, the, danelaw, this, was, the, great, army, a, term, used, by, the, chronicle, in, england, and, by, adrevald, of, fleury, on, the, continent, the, invaders, were, able, to, exploit, the, feuds, between, and, within, the, various, kingdoms, and, to, appoint, puppet, kings, such, as, ceolwulf, in, mercia, in, 873, and, perhaps, others, in, northumbria, in, 867, and, east, anglia, in, 870, the, third, phase, was, an, era, of, settlement, however, the, great, army, went, wherever, it, could, find, the, richest, pickings, crossing, the, english, channel, when, faced, with, resolute, opposition, as, in, england, in, 878, or, with, famine, as, on, the, continent, in, 892, by, this, stage, the, vikings, were, assuming, ever, increasing, importance, as, catalysts, of, social, and, political, change, they, constituted, the, common, enemy, making, the, english, more, conscious, of, a, national, identity, which, overrode, deeper, distinctions, they, could, be, perceived, as, an, instrument, of, divine, punishment, for, the, people, s, sins, raising, awareness, of, a, collective, christian, identity, and, by, conquering, the, kingdoms, of, the, east, angles, the, northumbrians, and, the, mercians, they, created, a, vacuum, in, the, leadership, of, the, english, people, danish, settlement, continued, in, mercia, in, 877, and, east, anglia, in, 879, 80, and, 896, the, rest, of, the, army, meanwhile, continued, to, harry, and, plunder, on, both, sides, of, the, channel, with, new, recruits, evidently, arriving, to, swell, its, ranks, for, it, clearly, continued, to, be, a, formidable, fighting, force, at, first, alfred, responded, by, the, offer, of, repeated, tribute, payments, however, after, a, decisive, victory, at, edington, in, 878, alfred, offered, vigorous, opposition, he, established, a, chain, of, fortresses, across, the, south, of, england, reorganised, the, army, so, that, always, half, its, men, were, at, home, and, half, out, on, service, except, for, those, men, who, were, to, garrison, the, burhs, and, in, 896, ordered, a, new, type, of, craft, to, be, built, which, could, oppose, the, viking, longships, in, shallow, coastal, waters, when, the, vikings, returned, from, the, continent, in, 892, they, found, they, could, no, longer, roam, the, country, at, will, for, wherever, they, went, they, were, opposed, by, a, local, army, after, four, years, the, scandinavians, therefore, split, up, some, to, settle, in, northumbria, and, east, anglia, the, remainder, to, try, their, luck, again, on, the, continent, more, important, to, alfred, than, his, military, and, political, victories, were, his, religion, his, love, of, learning, and, his, spread, of, writing, throughout, england, keynes, suggests, alfred, s, work, laid, the, foundations, for, what, really, made, england, unique, in, all, of, medieval, europe, from, around, 800, until, 1066, thinking, about, how, learning, and, culture, had, fallen, since, the, last, century, king, alfred, wrote, so, completely, had, wisdom, fallen, off, in, england, that, there, were, very, few, on, this, side, of, the, humber, who, could, understand, their, rituals, in, english, or, indeed, could, translate, a, letter, from, latin, into, english, and, i, believe, that, there, were, not, many, beyond, the, humber, there, were, so, few, of, them, that, i, indeed, cannot, think, of, a, single, one, south, of, the, thames, when, i, became, king, preface, gregory, the, great, s, pastoral, care, alfred, knew, that, literature, and, learning, both, in, english, and, in, latin, were, very, important, but, the, state, of, learning, was, not, good, when, alfred, came, to, the, throne, alfred, saw, kingship, as, a, priestly, office, a, shepherd, for, his, people, one, book, that, was, particularly, valuable, to, him, was, gregory, the, great, s, cura, pastoralis, pastoral, care, this, is, a, priest, s, guide, on, how, to, care, for, people, alfred, took, this, book, as, his, own, guide, on, how, to, be, a, good, king, to, his, people, hence, a, good, king, to, alfred, increases, literacy, alfred, translated, this, book, himself, and, explains, in, the, preface, when, i, had, learned, it, i, translated, it, into, english, just, as, i, had, understood, it, and, as, i, could, most, meaningfully, render, it, and, i, will, send, one, to, each, bishopric, in, my, kingdom, and, in, each, will, be, an, stel, worth, fifty, mancuses, and, i, command, in, god, s, name, that, no, man, may, take, the, stel, from, the, book, nor, the, book, from, the, church, it, is, unknown, how, long, there, may, be, such, learned, bishops, as, thanks, to, god, are, nearly, everywhere, preface, gregory, the, great, s, pastoral, care, what, is, presumed, to, be, one, of, these, stel, the, word, only, appears, in, this, one, text, is, the, gold, rock, crystal, and, enamel, alfred, jewel, discovered, in, 1693, which, is, assumed, to, have, been, fitted, with, a, small, rod, and, used, as, a, pointer, when, reading, alfred, provided, functional, patronage, linked, to, a, social, programme, of, vernacular, literacy, in, england, which, was, unprecedented, therefore, it, seems, better, to, me, if, it, seems, so, to, you, that, we, also, translate, certain, books, and, bring, it, about, if, we, have, the, peace, that, all, the, youth, of, free, men, who, now, are, in, england, those, who, have, the, means, that, they, may, apply, themselves, to, it, be, set, to, learning, while, they, may, not, be, set, to, any, other, use, until, the, time, when, they, can, well, read, english, writings, preface, gregory, the, great, s, pastoral, care, this, began, a, growth, in, charters, law, theology, and, learning, alfred, thus, laid, the, foundation, for, the, great, accomplishments, of, the, tenth, century, and, did, much, to, make, the, vernacular, more, important, than, latin, in, anglo, saxon, culture, i, desired, to, live, worthily, as, long, as, i, lived, and, to, leave, after, my, life, to, the, men, who, should, come, after, me, the, memory, of, me, in, good, works, preface, the, consolation, of, philosophy, by, boethius, a, framework, for, the, momentous, events, of, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, is, provided, by, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, however, charters, law, codes, and, coins, supply, detailed, information, on, various, aspects, of, royal, government, and, the, surviving, works, of, anglo, latin, and, vernacular, literature, as, well, as, the, numerous, manuscripts, written, in, the, 10th, century, testify, in, their, different, ways, to, the, vitality, of, ecclesiastical, culture, yet, as, keynes, suggests, it, does, not, follow, that, the, 10th, century, is, better, understood, than, more, sparsely, documented, periods, during, the, course, of, the, 10th, century, the, west, saxon, kings, extended, their, power, first, over, mercia, then, into, the, southern, danelaw, and, finally, over, northumbria, thereby, imposing, a, semblance, of, political, unity, on, peoples, who, nonetheless, would, remain, conscious, of, their, respective, customs, and, their, separate, pasts, the, prestige, and, indeed, the, pretensions, of, the, monarchy, increased, the, institutions, of, government, strengthened, and, kings, and, their, agents, sought, in, various, ways, to, establish, social, order, this, process, started, with, edward, the, elder, who, with, his, sister, thelfl, d, lady, of, the, mercians, initially, charters, reveal, encouraged, people, to, purchase, estates, from, the, danes, thereby, to, reassert, some, degree, of, english, influence, in, territory, which, had, fallen, under, danish, control, david, dumville, suggests, that, edward, may, have, extended, this, policy, by, rewarding, his, supporters, with, grants, of, land, in, the, territories, newly, conquered, from, the, danes, and, that, any, charters, issued, in, respect, of, such, grants, have, not, survived, when, athelfl, d, died, mercia, was, absorbed, by, wessex, from, that, point, on, there, was, no, contest, for, the, throne, so, the, house, of, wessex, became, the, ruling, house, of, england, edward, the, elder, was, succeeded, by, his, son, thelstan, whom, keynes, calls, the, towering, figure, in, the, landscape, of, the, tenth, century, his, victory, over, a, coalition, of, his, enemies, constantine, king, of, the, scots, owain, ap, dyfnwal, king, of, the, cumbrians, and, olaf, guthfrithson, king, of, dublin, at, the, battle, of, brunanburh, celebrated, by, a, poem, in, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, opened, the, way, for, him, to, be, hailed, as, the, first, king, of, england, thelstan, s, legislation, shows, how, the, king, drove, his, officials, to, do, their, respective, duties, he, was, uncompromising, in, his, insistence, on, respect, for, the, law, however, this, legislation, also, reveals, the, persistent, difficulties, which, confronted, the, king, and, his, councillors, in, bringing, a, troublesome, people, under, some, form, of, control, his, claim, to, be, king, of, the, english, was, by, no, means, widely, recognised, the, situation, was, complex, the, hiberno, norse, rulers, of, dublin, still, coveted, their, interests, in, the, danish, kingdom, of, york, terms, had, to, be, made, with, the, scots, who, had, the, capacity, not, merely, to, interfere, in, northumbrian, affairs, but, also, to, block, a, line, of, communication, between, dublin, and, york, and, the, inhabitants, of, northern, northumbria, were, considered, a, law, unto, themselves, it, was, only, after, twenty, years, of, crucial, developments, following, thelstan, s, death, in, 939, that, a, unified, kingdom, of, england, began, to, assume, its, familiar, shape, however, the, major, political, problem, for, edmund, and, eadred, who, succeeded, thelstan, remained, the, difficulty, of, subjugating, the, north, in, 959, edgar, is, said, to, have, succeeded, to, the, kingdom, both, in, wessex, and, in, mercia, and, in, northumbria, and, he, was, then, 16, years, old, asc, version, b, c, and, is, called, the, peacemaker, by, the, early, 970s, after, a, decade, of, edgar, s, peace, it, may, have, seemed, that, the, kingdom, of, england, was, indeed, made, whole, in, his, formal, address, to, the, gathering, at, winchester, the, king, urged, his, bishops, abbots, and, abbesses, to, be, of, one, mind, as, regards, monastic, usage, lest, differing, ways, of, observing, the, customs, of, one, rule, and, one, country, should, bring, their, holy, conversation, into, disrepute, athelstan, s, court, had, been, an, intellectual, incubator, in, that, court, were, two, young, men, named, dunstan, and, thelwold, who, were, made, priests, supposedly, at, the, insistence, of, athelstan, right, at, the, end, of, his, reign, in, 939, between, 970, and, 973, a, council, was, held, under, the, aegis, of, edgar, where, a, set, of, rules, were, devised, that, would, be, applicable, throughout, england, this, put, all, the, monks, and, nuns, in, england, under, one, set, of, detailed, customs, for, the, first, time, in, 973, edgar, received, a, special, second, imperial, coronation, at, bath, and, from, this, point, england, was, ruled, by, edgar, under, the, strong, influence, of, dunstan, athelwold, and, oswald, the, bishop, of, worcester, the, reign, of, king, thelred, the, unready, witnessed, the, resumption, of, viking, raids, on, england, putting, the, country, and, its, leadership, under, strains, as, severe, as, they, were, long, sustained, raids, began, on, a, relatively, small, scale, in, the, 980s, but, became, far, more, serious, in, the, 990s, and, brought, the, people, to, their, knees, in, 1009, 12, when, a, large, part, of, the, country, was, devastated, by, the, army, of, thorkell, the, tall, it, remained, for, swein, forkbeard, king, of, denmark, to, conquer, the, kingdom, of, england, in, 1013, 14, and, after, thelred, s, restoration, for, his, son, cnut, to, achieve, the, same, in, 1015, 16, the, tale, of, these, years, incorporated, in, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, must, be, read, in, its, own, right, and, set, beside, other, material, which, reflects, in, one, way, or, another, on, the, conduct, of, government, and, warfare, during, thelred, s, reign, it, is, this, evidence, which, is, the, basis, for, keynes, s, view, that, the, king, lacked, the, strength, judgement, and, resolve, to, give, adequate, leadership, to, his, people, in, a, time, of, grave, national, crisis, who, soon, found, out, that, he, could, rely, on, little, but, the, treachery, of, his, military, commanders, and, who, throughout, his, reign, tasted, nothing, but, the, ignominy, of, defeat, the, raids, exposed, tensions, and, weaknesses, which, went, deep, into, the, fabric, of, the, late, anglo, saxon, state, and, it, is, apparent, that, events, proceeded, against, a, background, more, complex, than, the, chronicler, probably, knew, it, seems, for, example, that, the, death, of, bishop, thelwold, in, 984, had, precipitated, further, reaction, against, certain, ecclesiastical, interests, that, by, 993, the, king, had, come, to, regret, the, error, of, his, ways, leading, to, a, period, when, the, internal, affairs, of, the, kingdom, appear, to, have, prospered, the, increasingly, difficult, times, brought, on, by, the, viking, attacks, are, reflected, in, both, lfric, s, and, wulfstan, s, works, but, most, notably, in, wulfstan, s, fierce, rhetoric, in, the, sermo, lupi, ad, anglos, dated, to, 1014, malcolm, godden, suggests, that, ordinary, people, saw, the, return, of, the, vikings, as, the, imminent, expectation, of, the, apocalypse, and, this, was, given, voice, in, lfric, and, wulfstan, writings, which, is, similar, to, that, of, gildas, and, bede, raids, were, taken, as, signs, of, god, punishing, his, people, lfric, refers, to, people, adopting, the, customs, of, the, danish, and, exhorts, people, not, to, abandon, the, native, customs, on, behalf, of, the, danish, ones, and, then, requests, a, brother, edward, to, try, to, put, an, end, to, a, shameful, habit, of, drinking, and, eating, in, the, outhouse, which, some, of, the, countrywomen, practised, at, beer, parties, in, april, 1016, thelred, died, of, illness, leaving, his, son, and, successor, edmund, ironside, to, defend, the, country, the, final, struggles, were, complicated, by, internal, dissension, and, especially, by, the, treacherous, acts, of, ealdorman, eadric, of, mercia, who, opportunistically, changed, sides, to, cnut, s, party, after, the, defeat, of, the, english, in, the, battle, of, assandun, in, october, 1016, edmund, and, cnut, agreed, to, divide, the, kingdom, so, that, edmund, would, rule, wessex, and, cnut, mercia, but, edmund, died, soon, after, his, defeat, in, november, 1016, making, it, possible, for, cnut, to, seize, power, over, all, england, in, the, 11th, century, there, were, three, conquests, one, by, cnut, on, october, 18, 1016, the, second, was, an, unsuccessful, attempt, of, battle, of, stamford, bridge, in, september, 1066, and, the, third, was, conducted, by, william, of, normandy, in, october, 1066, at, hastings, the, consequences, of, each, conquest, changed, the, anglo, saxon, culture, politically, and, chronologically, the, texts, of, this, period, are, not, anglo, saxon, linguistically, those, written, in, english, as, opposed, to, latin, or, french, the, other, official, written, languages, of, the, period, moved, away, from, the, late, west, saxon, standard, that, is, called, old, english, yet, neither, are, they, middle, english, moreover, as, treharne, explains, for, around, three, quarters, of, this, period, there, is, barely, any, original, writing, in, english, at, all, these, factors, have, led, to, a, gap, in, scholarship, implying, a, discontinuity, either, side, of, the, norman, conquest, however, this, assumption, is, being, challenged, at, first, sight, there, would, seem, little, to, debate, cnut, appeared, to, have, adopted, wholeheartedly, the, traditional, role, of, anglo, saxon, kingship, however, an, examination, of, the, laws, homilies, wills, and, charters, dating, from, this, period, suggests, that, as, a, result, of, widespread, aristocratic, death, and, the, fact, that, cnut, did, not, systematically, introduce, a, new, landholding, class, major, and, permanent, alterations, occurred, in, the, saxon, social, and, political, structures, eric, john, remarks, that, for, cnut, the, simple, difficulty, of, exercising, so, wide, and, so, unstable, an, empire, made, it, necessary, to, practise, a, delegation, of, authority, against, every, tradition, of, english, kingship, the, disappearance, of, the, aristocratic, families, which, had, traditionally, played, an, active, role, in, the, governance, of, the, realm, coupled, with, cnut, s, choice, of, thegnly, advisors, put, an, end, to, the, balanced, relationship, between, monarchy, and, aristocracy, so, carefully, forged, by, the, west, saxon, kings, edward, became, king, in, 1042, and, given, his, upbringing, might, have, been, considered, a, norman, by, those, who, lived, across, the, english, channel, following, cnut, s, reforms, excessive, power, was, concentrated, in, the, hands, of, the, rival, houses, of, leofric, of, mercia, and, godwine, of, wessex, problems, also, came, for, edward, from, the, resentment, caused, by, the, king, s, introduction, of, norman, friends, a, crisis, arose, in, 1051, when, godwine, defied, the, king, s, order, to, punish, the, men, of, dover, who, had, resisted, an, attempt, by, eustace, of, boulogne, to, quarter, his, men, on, them, by, force, the, support, of, earl, leofric, and, earl, siward, enabled, edward, to, secure, the, outlawry, of, godwine, and, his, sons, and, william, of, normandy, paid, edward, a, visit, during, which, edward, may, have, promised, william, succession, to, the, english, throne, although, this, norman, claim, may, have, been, mere, propaganda, godwine, and, his, sons, came, back, the, following, year, with, a, strong, force, and, the, magnates, were, not, prepared, to, engage, them, in, civil, war, but, forced, the, king, to, make, terms, some, unpopular, normans, were, driven, out, including, archbishop, robert, whose, archbishopric, was, given, to, stigand, this, act, supplied, an, excuse, for, the, papal, support, of, william, s, cause, the, fall, of, england, and, the, norman, conquest, is, a, multi, generational, multi, family, succession, problem, caused, in, great, part, by, athelred, s, incompetence, by, the, time, william, of, normandy, sensing, an, opportunity, landed, his, invading, force, in, 1066, the, elite, of, anglo, saxon, england, had, changed, although, much, of, the, culture, and, society, had, stayed, the, same, a, com, wyllelm, eorl, of, normandige, into, pefnesea, on,

king, harold, and, he, gathered, then, a, great, army, and, came, towards, them, at, the, hoary, apple, tree, and, william, came, upon, him, unawares, before, his, folk, were, ready, but, the, king, nevertheless, withstood, him, very, strongly, with, fighting, with, those, men, who, would, follow, him, and, there, was, a, great, slaughter, on, either, side, then, harald, the, king, was, slain, and, leofwine, the, earl, his, brother, and, gyrth, and, many, good, men, and, the, frenchmen, held, the, place, of, slaughter, following, the, norman, conquest, many, of, the, anglo, saxon, nobility, were, either, exiled, or, had, joined, the, ranks, of, the, peasantry, it, has, been, estimated, that, only, about, 8, of, the, land, was, under, anglo, saxon, control, by, 1087, in, 1086, only, four, major, anglo, saxon, landholders, still, held, their, lands, however, the, survival, of, anglo, saxon, heiresses, was, significantly, greater, many, of, the, next, generation, of, the, nobility, had, english, mothers, and, learned, to, speak, english, at, home, some, anglo, saxon, nobles, fled, to, scotland, ireland, and, scandinavia, the, byzantine, empire, became, a, popular, destination, for, many, anglo, saxon, soldiers, as, it, was, in, need, of, mercenaries, the, anglo, saxons, became, the, predominant, element, in, the, elite, varangian, guard, hitherto, a, largely, north, germanic, unit, from, which, the, emperor, s, bodyguard, was, drawn, and, continued, to, serve, the, empire, until, the, early, 15th, century, however, the, population, of, england, at, home, remained, largely, anglo, saxon, for, them, little, changed, immediately, except, that, their, anglo, saxon, lord, was, replaced, by, a, norman, lord, the, chronicler, orderic, vitalis, who, was, the, product, of, an, anglo, norman, marriage, writes, and, so, the, english, groaned, aloud, for, their, lost, liberty, and, plotted, ceaselessly, to, find, some, way, of, shaking, off, a, yoke, that, was, so, intolerable, and, unaccustomed, the, inhabitants, of, the, north, and, scotland, never, warmed, to, the, normans, following, the, harrying, of, the, north, 1069, 1070, where, william, according, to, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, utterly, ravaged, and, laid, waste, that, shire, many, anglo, saxon, people, needed, to, learn, norman, french, to, communicate, with, their, rulers, but, it, is, clear, that, among, themselves, they, kept, speaking, old, english, which, meant, that, england, was, in, an, interesting, tri, lingual, situation, anglo, saxon, for, the, common, people, latin, for, the, church, and, norman, french, for, the, administrators, the, nobility, and, the, law, courts, in, this, time, and, because, of, the, cultural, shock, of, the, conquest, anglo, saxon, began, to, change, very, rapidly, and, by, 1200, or, so, it, was, no, longer, anglo, saxon, english, but, early, middle, english, but, this, language, had, deep, roots, in, anglo, saxon, which, was, being, spoken, much, later, than, 1066, research, has, shown, that, a, form, of, anglo, saxon, was, still, being, spoken, and, not, merely, among, uneducated, peasants, into, the, thirteenth, century, in, the, west, midlands, this, was, j, r, r, tolkien, s, major, scholarly, discovery, when, he, studied, a, group, of, texts, written, in, early, middle, english, called, the, katherine, group, tolkien, noticed, that, a, subtle, distinction, preserved, in, these, texts, indicated, that, old, english, had, continued, to, be, spoken, far, longer, than, anyone, had, supposed, old, english, had, been, a, central, mark, of, the, anglo, saxon, cultural, identity, with, the, passing, of, time, however, and, particularly, following, the, norman, conquest, of, england, this, language, changed, significantly, and, although, some, people, for, example, the, scribe, known, as, the, tremulous, hand, of, worcester, could, still, read, old, english, into, the, thirteenth, century, it, fell, out, of, use, and, the, texts, became, useless, the, exeter, book, for, example, seems, to, have, been, used, to, press, gold, leaf, and, at, one, point, had, a, pot, of, fish, based, glue, sitting, on, top, of, it, for, michael, drout, this, symbolises, the, end, of, the, anglo, saxons, after, 1066, it, took, more, than, three, centuries, for, english, to, replace, french, as, the, language, of, government, the, 1362, parliament, opened, with, a, speech, in, english, and, in, the, early, 15th, century, henry, v, became, the, first, monarch, since, before, the, 1066, conquest, to, use, english, in, his, written, instructions, the, larger, narrative, seen, in, the, history, of, anglo, saxon, england, is, the, continued, mixing, and, integration, of, various, disparate, elements, into, one, anglo, saxon, people, the, outcome, of, this, mixing, and, integration, was, a, continuous, re, interpretation, by, the, anglo, saxons, of, their, society, and, worldview, which, heinreich, h, rke, calls, a, complex, and, ethnically, mixed, society, the, development, of, anglo, saxon, kingship, is, little, understood, before, the, 7th, century, royal, dynasties, often, claimed, descent, from, woden, or, another, deity, to, justify, their, rule, but, the, true, basis, of, their, power, was, as, warleaders, kings, were, buried, as, warriors, and, war, helmets, instead, of, crowns, were, used, in, coronations, until, the, 10th, century, a, king, s, relationship, with, his, warband, latin, comitatus, involved, mutual, obligations, his, warriors, fought, for, the, king, in, return, for, food, shelter, and, gifts, such, as, weapons, the, people, supported, their, king, and, his, warriors, with, food, rent, kings, extracted, surplus, by, raiding, and, collecting, food, rent, and, prestige, goods, the, later, sixth, century, saw, the, end, of, a, prestige, goods, economy, as, evidenced, by, the, decline, of, accompanied, burial, and, the, appearance, of, the, first, princely, graves, and, high, status, settlements, the, ship, burial, in, mound, one, at, sutton, hoo, suffolk, is, the, most, widely, known, example, of, a, princely, burial, containing, lavish, metalwork, and, feasting, equipment, and, possibly, representing, the, burial, place, of, king, raedwald, of, east, anglia, these, centres, of, trade, and, production, reflect, the, increased, socio, political, stratification, and, wider, territorial, authority, which, allowed, seventh, century, elites, to, extract, and, redistribute, surpluses, with, far, greater, effectiveness, than, their, sixth, century, predecessors, would, have, found, possible, anglo, saxon, society, in, short, looked, very, different, in, 600, than, it, did, a, hundred, years, earlier, by, 600, the, establishment, of, the, first, anglo, saxon, emporia, alternatively, wics, appears, to, have, been, in, process, there, are, only, four, major, archaeologically, attested, wics, in, england, london, ipswich, york, and, hamwic, these, were, originally, interpreted, by, richard, hodges, as, methods, of, royal, control, over, the, import, of, prestige, goods, rather, than, centre, of, actual, trade, proper, despite, archaeological, evidence, of, royal, involvement, emporia, are, now, widely, understood, to, represent, genuine, trade, and, exchange, alongside, a, return, to, urbanism, according, to, bede, s, ecclesiastical, history, england, was, divided, into, many, petty, kingdoms, during, the, 7th, century, the, tribal, hidage, of, the, later, 7th, century, lists, 35, people, groups, south, of, the, humber, the, first, law, code, written, in, a, germanic, language, the, law, of, thelberht, depicts, a, king, not, only, as, the, leader, of, a, warband, but, also, as, the, maintainer, of, law, and, order, his, laws, concerned, all, levels, of, society, the, nobility, ceorls, freemen, and, slaves, traders, missionaries, and, other, foreigners, who, lacked, the, protection, of, a, lord, or, kinship, ties, see, below, were, under, the, king, s, protection, old, english, mund, the, most, powerful, king, could, be, recognised, by, other, rulers, as, bretwalda, old, english, for, ruler, of, britain, bede, s, use, of, the, term, imperium, has, been, seen, as, significant, in, defining, the, status, and, powers, of, the, bretwaldas, in, fact, it, is, a, word, bede, used, regularly, as, an, alternative, to, regnum, scholars, believe, this, just, meant, the, collection, of, tribute, oswiu, s, extension, of, overlordship, over, the, picts, and, scots, is, expressed, in, terms, of, making, them, tributary, military, overlordship, could, bring, great, short, term, success, and, wealth, but, the, system, had, its, disadvantages, many, of, the, overlords, enjoyed, their, powers, for, a, relatively, short, period, foundations, had, to, be, carefully, laid, to, turn, a, tribute, paying, under, kingdom, into, a, permanent, acquisition, such, as, bernician, absorption, of, deira, only, five, anglo, saxon, kingdoms, are, known, to, have, survived, to, 800, and, several, british, kingdoms, in, the, west, of, the, country, had, disappeared, as, well, the, major, kingdoms, had, grown, through, absorbing, smaller, principalities, and, the, means, through, which, they, did, it, and, the, character, their, kingdoms, acquired, as, a, result, are, one, of, the, major, themes, of, the, middle, saxon, period, beowulf, for, all, its, heroic, content, clearly, makes, the, point, that, economic, and, military, success, were, intimately, linked, a, good, king, was, a, generous, king, who, through, his, wealth, won, the, support, which, would, ensure, his, supremacy, over, other, kingdoms, the, smaller, kingdoms, did, not, disappear, without, trace, once, they, were, incorporated, into, larger, polities, on, the, contrary, their, territorial, integrity, was, preserved, when, they, became, ealdormanries, or, depending, on, size, parts, of, ealdormanries, within, their, new, kingdoms, an, example, of, this, tendency, for, later, boundaries, to, preserve, earlier, arrangements, is, sussex, the, county, boundary, is, essentially, the, same, as, that, of, the, west, saxon, shire, and, the, anglo, saxon, kingdom, the, witan, also, called, witenagemot, was, the, council, of, kings, its, essential, duty, was, to, advise, the, king, on, all, matters, on, which, he, chose, to, ask, its, opinion, it, attested, his, grants, of, land, to, churches, or, laymen, consented, to, his, issue, of, new, laws, or, new, statements, of, ancient, custom, and, helped, him, deal, with, rebels, and, persons, suspected, of, disaffection, king, alfred, s, digressions, in, his, translation, of, boethius, consolation, of, philosophy, provided, these, observations, about, the, resources, which, every, king, needed, in, the, case, of, the, king, the, resources, and, tools, with, which, to, rule, are, that, he, have, his, land, fully, manned, he, must, have, praying, men, fighting, men, and, working, men, you, know, also, that, without, these, tools, no, king, may, make, his, ability, known, another, aspect, of, his, resources, is, that, he, must, have, the, means, of, support, for, his, tools, the, three, classes, of, men, these, then, are, their, means, of, support, land, to, live, on, gifts, weapons, food, ale, clothing, and, whatever, else, is, necessary, for, each, of, the, three, classes, of, men, this, is, the, first, written, appearance, of, the, division, of, society, into, the, three, orders, the, working, men, provided, the, raw, materials, to, support, the, other, two, classes, the, advent, of, christianity, brought, with, it, the, introduction, of, new, concepts, of, land, tenure, the, role, of, churchmen, was, analogous, with, that, of, the, warriors, waging, heavenly, warfare, however, what, alfred, was, alluding, to, was, that, in, order, for, a, king, to, fulfil, his, responsibilities, towards, his, people, particularly, those, concerned, with, defence, he, had, the, right, to, make, considerable, exactions, from, the, landowners, and, people, of, his, kingdom, the, need, to, endow, the, church, resulted, in, the, permanent, alienation, of, stocks, of, land, which, had, previously, only, been, granted, on, a, temporary, basis, and, introduced, the, concept, of, a, new, type, of, hereditary, land, which, could, be, freely, alienated, and, was, free, of, any, family, claims, the, nobility, under, the, influence, of, alfred, became, involved, with, developing, the, cultural, life, of, their, kingdom, as, the, kingdom, became, unified, it, brought, the, monastic, and, spiritual, life, of, the, kingdom, under, one, rule, and, stricter, control, however, the, anglo, saxons, believed, in, luck, as, a, random, element, in, the, affairs, of, man, and, so, would, probably, have, agreed, that, there, is, a, limit, to, the, extent, one, can, understand, why, one, kingdom, failed, while, another, succeeded, they, also, believed, in, destiny, and, interpreted, the, fate, of, the, kingdom, of, england, with, biblical, and, carolingian, ideology, with, parallels, between, the, israelites, the, great, european, empires, and, the, anglo, saxons, danish, and, norman, conquests, were, just, the, manner, in, which, god, punished, his, sinful, people, and, the, fate, of, great, empires, although, christianity, dominates, the, religious, history, of, the, anglo, saxons, life, in, the, 5th, and, 6th, centuries, was, dominated, by, pagan, religious, beliefs, with, a, scandinavian, germanic, heritage, pagan, anglo, saxons, worshipped, at, a, variety, of, different, sites, across, their, landscape, some, of, which, were, apparently, specially, built, temples, and, others, that, were, natural, geographical, features, such, as, sacred, trees, hilltops, or, wells, according, to, place, name, evidence, these, sites, of, worship, were, known, alternately, as, either, hearg, or, as, w, oh, most, poems, from, before, the, norman, conquest, are, steeped, in, pagan, symbolism, and, their, integration, into, the, new, faith, goes, beyond, the, literary, sources, thus, as, lethbridge, reminds, us, to, say, this, is, a, monument, erected, in, christian, times, and, therefore, the, symbolism, on, it, must, be, christian, is, an, unrealistic, approach, the, rites, of, the, older, faith, now, regarded, as, superstition, are, practised, all, over, the, country, today, it, did, not, mean, that, people, were, not, christian, but, that, they, could, see, a, lot, of, sense, in, the, old, beliefs, also, early, anglo, saxon, society, attached, great, significance, to, the, horse, a, horse, may, have, been, an, acquaintance, of, the, god, woden, and, or, they, may, have, been, according, to, tacitus, confidants, of, the, gods, horses, were, closely, associated, with, gods, especially, odin, and, freyr, horses, played, a, central, role, in, funerary, practices, as, well, as, in, other, rituals, horses, were, prominent, symbols, of, fertility, and, there, were, many, horse, fertility, cults, the, rituals, associated, with, these, include, horse, fights, burials, consumption, of, horse, meat, and, horse, sacrifice, hengist, and, horsa, the, mythical, ancestors, of, the, anglo, saxons, were, associated, with, horses, and, references, to, horses, are, found, throughout, anglo, saxon, literature, actual, horse, burials, in, england, are, relatively, rare, and, may, point, to, influence, from, the, continent, a, well, known, anglo, saxon, horse, burial, from, the, sixth, seventh, century, is, mound, 17, at, sutton, hoo, a, few, yards, from, the, more, famous, ship, burial, in, mound, 1, a, sixth, century, grave, near, lakenheath, suffolk, yielded, the, body, of, a, man, next, to, that, of, a, complete, horse, in, harness, with, a, bucket, of, food, by, its, head, bede, s, story, of, c, dmon, the, cowherd, who, became, the, father, of, english, poetry, represents, the, real, heart, of, the, conversion, of, the, anglo, saxons, from, paganism, to, christianity, bede, writes, here, was, in, the, monastery, of, this, abbess, streon, shalch, now, known, as, whitby, abbey, a, certain, brother, particularly, remarkable, for, the, grace, of, god, who, was, wont, to, make, religious, verses, so, that, whatever, was, interpreted, to, him, out, of, scripture, he, soon, after, put, the, same, into, poetical, expressions, of, much, sweetness, and, humility, in, old, english, which, was, his, native, language, by, his, verse, the, minds, of, many, were, often, excited, to, despise, the, world, and, to, aspire, to, heaven, the, story, of, c, dmon, illustrates, the, blending, of, christian, and, germanic, latin, and, oral, tradition, monasteries, and, double, monasteries, pre, existing, customs, and, new, learning, popular, and, elite, that, characterizes, the, conversion, period, of, anglo, saxon, history, and, culture, c, dmon, does, not, destroy, or, ignore, traditional, anglo, saxon, poetry, instead, he, converts, it, into, something, that, helps, the, church, anglo, saxon, england, finds, ways, to, synthesize, the, religion, of, the, church, with, the, existing, northern, customs, and, practices, thus, the, conversion, of, the, anglo, saxons, was, not, just, their, switching, from, one, practice, to, another, but, making, something, new, out, of, their, old, inheritance, and, their, new, belief, and, learning, monasticism, and, not, just, the, church, was, at, the, centre, of, anglo, saxon, christian, life, western, monasticism, as, a, whole, had, been, evolving, since, the, time, of, the, desert, fathers, but, in, the, seventh, century, monasticism, in, england, confronted, a, dilemma, that, brought, to, question, the, truest, representation, of, the, christian, faith, the, two, monastic, traditions, were, the, celtic, and, the, roman, and, a, decision, was, made, to, adopt, the, roman, tradition, monasteria, seem, to, describe, all, religious, congregations, other, than, those, of, the, bishop, in, the, 10th, century, dunstan, brought, athelwold, to, glastonbury, where, the, two, of, them, set, up, a, monastery, on, benedictine, lines, for, many, years, this, was, the, only, monastery, in, england, that, strictly, followed, the, benedictine, rule, and, observed, complete, monastic, discipline, what, mechthild, gretsch, calls, an, aldhelm, seminar, developed, at, glastonbury, and, the, effects, of, this, seminar, on, the, curriculum, of, learning, and, study, in, anglo, saxon, england, were, enormous, royal, power, was, put, behind, the, reforming, impulses, of, dunstan, and, athelwold, helping, them, to, enforce, their, reform, ideas, this, happened, first, at, the, old, minster, in, winchester, before, the, reformers, built, new, foundations, and, refoundations, at, thorney, peterborough, and, ely, among, other, places, benedictine, monasticism, spread, throughout, england, and, these, became, centers, of, learning, again, run, by, people, trained, in, glastonbury, with, one, rule, the, works, of, aldhelm, at, the, center, of, their, curricula, but, also, influenced, by, the, vernacular, efforts, of, alfred, from, this, mixture, sprung, a, great, flowering, of, literary, production, soldiers, throughout, the, country, were, summoned, for, both, offensive, and, defensive, war, early, armies, consisted, essentially, of, household, bands, while, later, on, men, were, recruited, on, a, territorial, basis, the, mustering, of, an, army, annually, at, times, occupied, an, important, place, in, frankish, history, both, military, and, constitutional, the, english, kingdoms, appear, to, have, known, no, institution, similar, to, this, the, earliest, reference, is, bede, s, account, of, the, overthrow, of, the, northumbrian, thelfrith, by, r, dwald, overlord, of, the, southern, english, r, dwald, raised, a, large, army, presumably, from, among, the, kings, who, accepted, his, overlordship, and, not, giving, him, time, to, summon, and, assemble, his, whole, army, r, dwald, met, him, with, a, much, greater, force, and, slew, him, on, the, mercian, border, on, the, east, bank, of, the, river, idle, at, the, battle, of, edington, in, 878, when, the, danes, made, a, surprise, attack, on, alfred, at, chippenham, after, twelfth, night, alfred, retreated, to, athelney, after, easter, and, then, seven, weeks, after, easter, mustered, an, army, at, egbert, s, stone, it, is, not, difficult, to, imagine, that, alfred, sent, out, word, to, the, ealdormen, to, call, his, men, to, arms, this, may, explain, the, delay, and, it, is, probably, no, more, than, coincidence, that, the, army, mustered, at, the, beginning, of, may, a, time, when, there, would, have, been, sufficient, grass, for, the, horses, there, is, also, information, about, the, mustering, of, fleets, in, the, eleventh, century, from, 992, to, 1066, fleets, were, assembled, at, london, or, returned, to, the, city, at, the, end, of, their, service, on, several, occasions, where, they, took, up, station, depended, on, the, quarter, from, which, a, threat, was, expected, sandwich, if, invasion, was, expected, from, the, north, or, the, isle, of, wight, if, it, was, from, normandy, once, they, left, home, these, armies, and, fleets, had, to, be, supplied, with, food, and, clothing, for, the, men, as, well, as, forage, for, the, horses, yet, if, armies, of, the, seventh, and, eighth, centuries, were, accompanied, by, servants, and, a, supply, train, of, lesser, free, men, alfred, found, these, arrangements, insufficient, to, defeat, the, vikings, one, of, his, reforms, was, to, divide, his, military, resources, into, thirds, one, part, manned, the, burhs, and, found, the, permanent, garrisons, which, would, make, it, impossible, for, the, danes, to, overrun, wessex, although, they, would, also, take, to, the, field, when, extra, soldiers, were, needed, the, remaining, two, would, take, it, in, turns, to, serve, they, were, allocated, a, fixed, term, of, service, and, brought, the, necessary, provisions, with, them, this, arrangement, did, not, always, function, well, on, one, occasion, a, division, on, service, went, home, in, the, middle, of, blockading, a, danish, army, on, thorney, island, its, provisions, were, consumed, and, its, term, had, expired, before, the, king, came, to, relieve, them, this, method, of, division, and, rotation, remained, in, force, up, to, 1066, in, 917, when, armies, from, wessex, and, mercia, were, in, the, field, from, early, april, until, november, one, division, went, home, and, another, took, over, again, in, 1052, when, edward, s, fleet, was, waiting, at, sandwich, to, intercept, godwine, s, return, the, ships, returned, to, london, to, take, on, new, earls, and, crews, the, importance, of, supply, vital, to, military, success, was, appreciated, even, if, it, was, taken, for, granted, and, features, only, incidentally, in, the, sources, military, training, and, strategy, are, two, important, matters, on, which, the, sources, are, typically, silent, there, are, no, references, in, literature, or, laws, to, men, training, and, so, it, is, necessary, to, fall, back, on, inference, for, the, noble, warrior, his, childhood, was, of, first, importance, in, learning, both, individual, military, skills, and, the, teamwork, essential, for, success, in, battle, perhaps, the, games, the, youthful, cuthbert, played, wrestling, jumping, running, and, every, other, exercise, had, some, military, significance, turning, to, strategy, of, the, period, before, alfred, the, evidence, gives, the, impression, that, anglo, saxon, armies, fought, battles, frequently, battle, was, risky, and, best, avoided, unless, all, the, factors, were, on, your, side, but, if, you, were, in, a, position, so, advantageous, that, you, were, willing, to, take, the, chance, it, is, likely, that, your, enemy, would, be, in, such, a, weak, position, that, he, would, avoid, battle, and, pay, tribute, battles, put, the, princes, lives, at, risk, as, is, demonstrated, by, the, northumbrian, and, mercian, overlordships, brought, to, an, end, by, a, defeat, in, the, field, gillingham, has, shown, how, few, pitched, battles, charlemagne, and, richard, i, chose, to, fight, a, defensive, strategy, becomes, more, apparent, in, the, later, part, of, alfred, s, reign, it, was, built, around, the, possession, of, fortified, places, and, the, close, pursuit, of, the, danes, to, harass, them, and, impede, their, preferred, occupation, of, plundering, alfred, and, his, lieutenants, were, able, to, fight, the, danes, to, a, standstill, by, their, repeated, ability, to, pursue, and, besiege, them, closely, in, fortified, camps, throughout, the, country, the, fortification, of, sites, at, witham, buckingham, towcester, and, colchester, persuaded, the, danes, of, the, surrounding, regions, to, submit, the, key, to, this, warfare, was, sieges, and, the, control, of, fortified, places, it, is, clear, that, the, new, fortresses, had, permanent, garrisons, and, that, they, were, supported, by, the, inhabitants, of, the, existing, burhs, when, danger, threatened, this, is, brought, out, most, clearly, in, the, description, of, the, campaigns, of, 917, in, the, chronicle, but, throughout, the, conquest, of, the, danelaw, by, edward, and, thelfl, d, it, is, clear, that, a, sophisticated, and, coordinated, strategy, was, being, applied, in, 973, a, single, currency, was, introduced, into, england, in, order, to, bring, about, political, unification, but, by, concentrating, bullion, production, at, many, coastal, mints, the, new, rulers, of, england, created, an, obvious, target, which, attracted, a, new, wave, of, viking, invasions, which, came, close, to, breaking, up, the, kingdom, of, the, english, from, 980, onwards, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, records, renewed, raiding, against, england, at, first, the, raids, were, probing, ventures, by, small, numbers, of, ships, crews, but, soon, grew, in, size, and, effect, until, the, only, way, of, dealing, with, the, vikings, appeared, to, be, to, pay, protection, money, to, buy, them, off, and, in, that, year, it, was, determined, that, tribute, should, first, be, paid, to, the, danish, men, because, of, the, great, terror, they, were, causing, along, the, coast, the, first, payment, was, 10, 000, pounds, the, payment, of, danegeld, had, to, be, underwritten, by, a, huge, balance, of, payments, surplus, this, could, only, be, achieved, by, stimulating, exports, and, cutting, imports, itself, accomplished, through, currency, devaluation, this, affected, everyone, in, the, kingdom, helena, hamerow, suggests, that, the, prevailing, model, of, working, life, and, settlement, particularly, for, the, early, period, was, one, of, shifting, settlement, and, building, tribal, kinship, the, mid, saxon, period, saw, diversification, the, development, of, enclosures, the, beginning, of, the, toft, system, closer, management, of, livestock, the, gradual, spread, of, the, mould, board, plough, informally, regular, plots, and, a, greater, permanence, with, further, settlement, consolidation, thereafter, foreshadowing, post, norman, conquest, villages, the, later, periods, saw, a, proliferation, of, service, features, including, barns, mills, and, latrines, most, markedly, on, high, status, sites, throughout, the, anglo, saxon, period, as, hamerow, suggests, local, and, extended, kin, groups, remained, the, essential, unit, of, production, this, is, very, noticeable, in, the, early, period, however, by, the, tenth, and, eleventh, centuries, the, rise, of, the, manor, and, its, significance, in, terms, of, both, settlement, and, the, management, of, land, which, becomes, very, evident, in, the, domesday, book, of, 1086, typical, anglo, saxon, farms, of, middle, period, are, often, characterised, as, peasant, farms, but, a, ceorl, who, was, the, lowest, ranking, freeman, in, early, anglo, saxon, society, was, not, a, peasant, but, an, arms, owning, male, with, the, support, of, a, kindred, access, to, law, and, the, wergild, situated, at, the, apex, of, an, extended, household, working, at, least, one, hide, of, land, the, farmer, had, freedom, and, rights, over, lands, with, provision, of, a, rent, or, duty, to, an, overlord, who, provided, only, slight, lordly, input, most, of, this, land, was, common, outfield, arable, land, of, an, outfield, infield, system, that, provided, individuals, with, the, means, to, build, a, basis, of, kinship, and, group, cultural, ties, the, collection, of, buildings, discovered, at, yeavering, formed, part, of, an, anglo, saxon, royal, vill, or, king, s, tun, these, tun, consisted, of, a, series, of, buildings, designed, to, provide, short, term, accommodation, for, the, king, and, his, household, it, is, thought, that, the, king, would, have, travelled, throughout, his, land, dispensing, justice, and, authority, and, collecting, rents, from, his, various, estates, such, visits, would, be, periodic, and, it, is, likely, that, he, would, visit, each, royal, villa, only, once, or, twice, per, year, the, latin, term, villa, regia, which, bede, uses, of, the, site, suggests, an, estate, centre, as, the, functional, heart, of, a, territory, held, in, the, king, s, demesne, the, territory, is, the, land, whose, surplus, production, is, taken, into, the, centre, as, food, render, to, support, the, king, and, his, retinue, on, their, periodic, visits, as, part, of, a, progress, around, the, kingdom, this, territorial, model, known, as, a, multiple, estate, or, shire, has, been, developed, in, a, range, of, studies, colm, o, brien, in, applying, this, to, yeavering, proposes, a, geographical, definition, of, the, wider, shire, of, yeavering, and, also, a, geographical, definition, of, the, principal, estate, whose, structures, hope, taylor, excavated, one, characteristic, that, the, king, s, tun, shared, with, some, other, groups, of, places, is, that, it, was, a, point, of, public, assembly, people, came, together, not, only, to, give, the, king, and, his, entourage, board, and, lodging, but, they, attended, upon, the, king, in, order, to, have, disputes, settled, cases, appealed, lands, granted, gifts, given, appointments, made, laws, promulgated, policy, debated, and, ambassadors, heard, people, also, assembled, for, other, reasons, such, as, to, hold, fairs, and, to, trade, the, first, creations, of, towns, are, linked, to, a, system, of, specialism, at, individual, settlements, which, is, evidenced, in, studying, place, names, sutterton, shoe, makers, tun, in, the, area, of, the, danelaw, such, places, are, sutterby, was, so, named, because, local, circumstances, allowed, the, growth, of, a, craft, recognised, by, the, people, of, surrounding, places, similarly, with, sapperton, the, soap, makers, tun, while, boultham, the, meadow, with, burdock, plants, may, well, have, developed, a, specialism, in, the, production, of, burrs, for, wool, carding, since, meadows, with, burdock, merely, growing, in, them, must, have, been, relatively, numerous, from, places, named, for, their, services, or, location, within, a, single, district, a, category, of, which, the, most, obvious, perhaps, are, the, eastons, and, westons, it, is, possible, to, move, outwards, to, glimpse, component, settlements, within, larger, economic, units, names, betray, some, role, within, a, system, of, seasonal, pasture, winderton, in, warwickshire, is, the, winter, tun, and, various, somertons, are, self, explanatory, hardwicks, are, dairy, farms, and, swinhopes, the, valleys, where, pigs, were, pastured, settlement, patterns, as, well, as, village, plans, in, england, fall, into, two, great, categories, scattered, farms, and, homesteads, in, upland, and, woodland, britain, nucleated, villages, across, a, swathe, of, central, england, the, chronology, of, nucleated, villages, is, much, debated, and, not, yet, clear, yet, there, is, strong, evidence, to, support, the, view, that, nucleation, occurred, in, the, tenth, century, or, perhaps, the, ninth, and, was, a, development, parallel, to, the, growth, of, towns, alfred, s, reference, to, praying, men, fighting, men, and, working, men, is, far, from, a, complete, description, of, his, society, women, in, the, anglo, saxon, kingdoms, appear, to, have, enjoyed, considerable, independence, whether, as, abbesses, of, the, great, double, monasteries, of, monks, and, nuns, founded, during, the, seventh, and, eighth, centuries, as, major, land, holders, recorded, in, domesday, book, 1086, or, as, ordinary, members, of, society, they, could, act, as, principals, in, legal, transactions, were, entitled, to, the, same, weregild, as, men, of, the, same, class, and, were, considered, oath, worthy, with, the, right, to, defend, themselves, on, oath, against, false, accusations, or, claims, sexual, and, other, offences, against, them, were, penalised, heavily, there, is, evidence, that, even, married, women, could, own, property, independently, and, some, surviving, wills, are, in, the, joint, names, of, husband, and, wife, marriage, comprised, a, contract, between, the, woman, s, family, and, the, prospective, bridegroom, who, was, required, to, pay, a, bride, price, in, advance, of, the, wedding, and, a, morning, gift, following, its, consummation, the, latter, became, the, woman, s, personal, property, but, the, former, may, have, been, paid, to, her, relatives, at, least, during, the, early, period, widows, were, in, a, particularly, favourable, position, with, inheritance, rights, custody, of, their, children, and, authority, over, dependents, however, a, degree, of, vulnerability, may, be, reflected, in, laws, stating, that, they, should, not, be, forced, into, nunneries, or, second, marriages, against, their, will, the, system, of, primogeniture, inheritance, by, the, first, born, male, was, not, introduced, to, england, until, after, the, norman, conquest, so, anglo, saxon, siblings, girls, as, well, as, boys, were, more, equal, in, terms, of, status, the, age, of, majority, was, usually, either, ten, or, twelve, when, a, child, could, legally, take, charge, of, inherited, property, or, be, held, responsible, for, a, crime, it, was, common, for, children, to, be, fostered, either, in, other, households, or, in, monasteries, perhaps, as, a, means, of, extending, the, circle, of, protection, beyond, the, kin, group, laws, also, make, provision, for, orphaned, children, and, foundlings, the, traditional, distinction, in, society, amongst, free, men, was, expressed, as, eorl, and, ceorl, earl, and, churl, though, the, term, earl, took, on, a, more, restricted, meaning, after, the, viking, period, the, noble, rank, is, designated, in, early, centuries, as, gesi, as, companions, or, egnas, thegns, the, latter, coming, to, predominate, after, the, norman, conquest, the, title, thegn, was, equated, to, the, norman, baron, a, certain, amount, of, social, mobility, is, implied, by, regulations, detailing, the, conditions, under, which, a, ceorl, could, become, a, thegn, again, these, would, have, been, subject, to, local, variation, but, one, text, refers, to, the, possession, of, five, hides, of, land, around, 600, acres, a, bell, and, a, castle, gate, a, seat, and, a, special, office, in, the, king, s, hall, in, the, context, of, the, control, of, boroughs, frank, stenton, notes, that, according, to, an, 11th, century, source, a, merchant, who, had, carried, out, three, voyages, at, his, own, charge, regarded, as, of, thegnly, status, loss, of, status, could, also, occur, as, with, penal, slavery, which, could, be, imposed, not, only, on, the, perpetrator, of, a, crime, but, on, his, wife, and, family, a, further, division, in, anglo, saxon, society, was, between, slave, and, free, slavery, was, not, as, common, as, in, other, societies, but, appears, to, have, been, present, throughout, the, period, both, the, freemen, and, slaves, were, hierarchically, structured, with, several, classes, of, freemen, and, many, types, of, slaves, these, varied, at, different, times, and, in, different, areas, but, the, most, prominent, ranks, within, free, society, were, the, king, the, nobleman, or, thegn, and, the, ordinary, freeman, or, ceorl, they, were, differentiated, primarily, by, the, value, of, their, weregild, or, man, price, which, was, not, only, the, amount, payable, in, compensation, for, homicide, but, was, also, used, as, the, basis, for, other, legal, formulations, such, as, the, value, of, the, oath, that, they, could, swear, in, a, court, of, law, slaves, had, no, weregild, as, offences, against, them, were, taken, to, be, offences, against, their, owners, but, the, earliest, laws, set, out, a, detailed, scale, of, penalties, depending, both, on, the, type, of, slave, and, the, rank, of, owner, the, exeter, book, riddle, 12, 49, and, 52, both, describe, swarthy, dark, haired, britons, while, riddle, 72, describes, a, lower, class, dark, welsh, herdsman, some, slaves, may, have, been, members, of, the, native, british, population, conquered, by, the, anglo, saxons, when, they, arrived, from, the, continent, others, may, have, been, captured, in, wars, between, the, early, kingdoms, or, have, sold, themselves, for, food, in, times, of, famine, however, slavery, was, not, always, permanent, and, slaves, who, had, gained, their, freedom, would, become, part, of, an, underclass, of, freedmen, below, the, rank, of, ceorl, early, anglo, saxon, buildings, in, britain, were, generally, simple, not, using, masonry, except, in, foundations, but, constructed, mainly, using, timber, with, thatch, roofing, generally, preferring, not, to, settle, within, the, old, roman, cities, the, anglo, saxons, built, small, towns, near, their, centres, of, agriculture, at, fords, in, rivers, or, near, natural, ports, in, each, town, a, main, hall, was, in, the, centre, provided, with, a, central, hearth, only, ten, of, the, hundreds, of, settlement, sites, that, have, been, excavated, in, england, from, this, period, have, revealed, masonry, domestic, structures, and, confined, to, a, few, specific, contexts, timber, was, the, natural, building, medium, of, the, age, the, anglo, saxon, word, for, building, is, timbe, unlike, in, the, carolingian, empire, late, anglo, saxon, royal, halls, continued, to, be, of, timber, in, the, manner, of, yeavering, centuries, before, even, though, the, king, could, clearly, have, mustered, the, resources, to, build, in, stone, their, preference, must, have, been, a, conscious, choice, perhaps, an, expression, of, deeply, embedded, germanic, identity, on, the, part, of, the, anglo, saxon, royalty, even, the, elite, had, simple, buildings, with, a, central, fire, and, a, hole, in, the, roof, to, let, the, smoke, escape, the, largest, homes, rarely, had, more, than, one, floor, and, one, room, buildings, varied, widely, in, size, most, were, square, or, rectangular, though, some, round, houses, have, been, found, frequently, these, buildings, have, sunken, floors, with, a, shallow, pit, over, which, a, plank, floor, was, suspended, the, pit, may, have, been, used, for, storage, but, more, likely, was, filled, with, straw, for, insulation, a, variation, on, the, sunken, floor, design, has, been, found, in, towns, where, the, basement, may, be, as, deep, as, 9, feet, suggesting, a, storage, or, work, area, below, a, suspended, floor, another, common, design, was, simple, post, framing, with, heavy, posts, set, directly, into, the, ground, supporting, the, roof, the, space, between, the, posts, was, filled, in, with, wattle, and, daub, or, occasionally, planks, the, floors, were, generally, packed, earth, though, planks, were, sometimes, used, roofing, materials, varied, with, thatch, being, the, most, common, though, turf, and, even, wooden, shingles, were, also, used, stone, was, sometimes, used, to, build, churches, bede, makes, it, clear, that, the, masonry, construction, of, churches, including, his, own, at, jarrow, was, undertaken, morem, romanorum, in, the, manner, of, the, romans, in, explicit, contrast, to, existing, traditions, of, timber, construction, even, at, canterbury, bede, believed, that, st, augustine, s, first, cathedral, had, been, repaired, or, recovered, recuperavit, from, an, existing, roman, church, when, in, fact, it, had, been, newly, constructed, from, roman, materials, the, belief, was, the, christian, church, was, roman, therefore, a, masonry, church, was, a, roman, building, the, building, of, churches, in, anglo, saxon, england, essentially, began, with, augustine, of, canterbury, in, kent, following, 597, for, this, he, probably, imported, workmen, from, frankish, gaul, the, cathedral, and, abbey, in, canterbury, together, with, churches, in, kent, at, minster, in, sheppey, c, 664, and, reculver, 669, and, in, essex, at, the, chapel, of, st, peter, on, the, wall, at, bradwell, on, sea, define, the, earliest, type, in, southeast, england, a, simple, nave, without, aisles, provided, the, setting, for, the, main, altar, east, of, this, a, chancel, arch, separated, the, apse, for, use, by, the, clergy, flanking, the, apse, and, east, end, of, the, nave, were, side, chambers, serving, as, sacristies, further, porticus, might, continue, along, the, nave, to, provide, for, burials, and, other, purposes, in, northumbria, the, early, development, of, christianity, was, influenced, by, the, irish, mission, important, churches, being, built, in, timber, masonry, churches, became, prominent, from, the, late, 7th, century, with, the, foundations, of, wilfrid, at, ripon, and, hexham, and, of, benedict, biscop, at, monkwearmouth, jarrow, these, buildings, had, long, naves, and, small, rectangular, chancels, porticus, sometimes, surrounded, the, naves, elaborate, crypts, are, a, feature, of, wilfrid, s, buildings, the, best, preserved, early, northumbrian, church, is, escomb, church, from, the, mid, 8th, century, to, the, mid, 10th, century, several, important, buildings, survive, one, group, comprises, the, first, known, churches, utilizing, aisles, brixworth, the, most, ambitious, anglo, saxon, church, to, survive, largely, intact, wareham, st, mary, s, cirencester, and, the, rebuilding, of, canterbury, cathedral, these, buildings, may, be, compared, with, churches, in, the, carolingian, empire, other, lesser, churches, may, be, dated, to, the, late, eighth, and, early, ninth, centuries, on, the, basis, of, their, elaborate, sculptured, decoration, and, have, simple, naves, with, side, porticus, the, tower, of, barnack, hearkens, to, the, west, saxon, reconquest, in, the, early, 10th, century, when, decorative, features, that, were, to, be, characteristic, of, late, anglo, saxon, architecture, were, already, developed, such, as, narrow, raised, bands, of, stone, pilaster, strips, to, surround, archways, and, to, articulate, wall, surfaces, as, at, barton, upon, humber, and, earls, barton, in, plan, however, the, churches, remained, essentially, conservative, from, the, monastic, revival, of, the, second, half, of, the, tenth, century, only, a, few, documented, buildings, survive, or, have, been, excavated, examples, include, the, abbeys, of, glastonbury, old, minster, winchester, romsey, cholsey, and, peterborough, cathedral, the, majority, of, churches, that, have, been, described, as, anglo, saxon, fall, into, the, period, between, the, late, 10th, century, and, the, early, 12th, century, during, this, period, many, settlements, were, first, provided, with, stone, churches, but, timber, also, continued, to, be, used, the, best, wood, framed, church, to, survive, is, greensted, church, in, essex, no, earlier, than, the, 9th, century, and, no, doubt, typical, of, many, parish, churches, on, the, continent, during, the, eleventh, century, a, group, of, interrelated, romanesque, styles, developed, associated, with, the, rebuilding, of, many, churches, on, a, grand, scale, made, possible, by, a, general, advance, in, architectural, technology, and, mason, craft, the, first, fully, romanesque, church, in, england, was, edward, the, confessor, s, rebuilding, of, westminster, abbey, c, 1042, 60, now, entirely, lost, to, later, construction, while, the, main, development, of, the, style, only, followed, the, norman, conquest, however, at, stow, minster, the, crossing, piers, of, the, early, 1050s, are, clearly, proto, romanesque, a, more, decorative, interpretation, of, romanesque, in, lesser, churches, can, be, dated, only, somewhere, between, the, mid, and, late, 11th, century, e, g, hadstock, essex, clayton, and, sompting, sussex, this, style, continued, towards, the, end, of, the, century, as, at, milborne, port, somerset, at, st, augustine, s, abbey, in, canterbury, c, 1048, 61, abbot, wulfric, aimed, to, retain, the, earlier, churches, while, linking, them, with, an, octagonal, rotunda, but, the, concept, was, still, essentially, pre, romanesque, anglo, saxon, churches, of, all, periods, would, have, been, embellished, with, a, range, of, arts, including, wall, paintings, some, stained, glass, metalwork, and, statues, early, anglo, saxon, art, is, seen, mostly, in, decorated, jewellery, like, brooches, buckles, beads, and, wrist, clasps, some, of, outstanding, quality, characteristic, of, the, 5th, century, is, the, quoit, brooch, with, motifs, based, on, crouching, animals, as, seen, on, the, silver, quoit, brooch, from, sarre, kent, while, the, origins, of, this, style, are, disputed, it, is, either, an, offshoot, of, provincial, roman, frankish, or, jutish, art, one, style, flourished, from, the, late, 5th, century, and, continued, throughout, the, 6th, and, is, on, many, square, headed, brooches, it, is, characterised, by, chip, carved, patterns, based, on, animals, and, masks, a, different, style, which, gradually, superseded, it, is, dominated, by, serpentine, beasts, with, interlacing, bodies, by, the, later, 6th, century, the, best, works, from, the, south, east, are, distinguished, by, greater, use, of, expensive, materials, above, all, gold, and, garnets, reflecting, the, growing, prosperity, of, a, more, organised, society, which, had, greater, access, to, imported, precious, materials, as, seen, in, the, buckle, from, the, taplow, burial, and, the, jewellery, from, sutton, hoo, c, 600, and, c, 625, respectively, the, possible, symbolism, of, the, decorative, elements, like, interlace, and, beast, forms, that, were, used, in, these, early, works, remains, unclear, these, objects, were, the, products, of, a, society, that, invested, its, modest, surpluses, in, personal, display, that, fostered, craftsmen, and, jewellers, of, a, high, standard, and, in, which, the, possession, of, a, fine, brooch, or, buckle, was, a, valuable, status, symbol, the, staffordshire, hoard, is, the, largest, hoard, of, anglo, saxon, gold, and, silver, metalwork, yet, found, discovered, in, a, field, near, the, village, of, hammerwich, it, consists, of, over, 3, 500, items, that, are, nearly, all, martial, in, character, and, contains, no, objects, specific, to, female, uses, it, demonstrates, that, considerable, quantities, of, high, grade, goldsmiths, work, were, in, circulation, among, the, elite, during, the, 7th, century, it, also, shows, that, the, value, of, such, items, as, currency, and, their, potential, roles, as, tribute, or, the, spoils, of, war, could, in, a, warrior, society, outweigh, appreciation, of, their, integrity, and, artistry, the, christianization, of, the, society, revolutionised, the, visual, arts, as, well, as, other, aspects, of, society, art, had, to, fulfil, new, functions, and, whereas, pagan, art, was, abstract, christianity, required, images, clearly, representing, subjects, the, transition, between, the, christian, and, pagan, traditions, is, occasionally, apparent, in, 7th, century, works, examples, include, the, crundale, buckle, and, the, canterbury, pendant, in, addition, to, fostering, metalworking, skills, christianity, stimulated, stone, sculpture, and, manuscript, illumination, in, these, germanic, motifs, such, as, interlace, and, animal, ornament, along, with, celtic, spiral, patterns, are, juxtaposed, with, christian, imagery, and, mediterranean, decoration, notably, vine, scroll, the, ruthwell, cross, bewcastle, cross, and, easby, cross, are, leading, northumbrian, examples, of, the, anglo, saxon, version, of, the, celtic, high, cross, generally, with, a, slimmer, shaft, the, jamb, of, the, doorway, at, monkwearmouth, carved, with, a, pair, of, lacertine, beasts, probably, dates, from, the, 680s, the, golden, garnet, adorned, pectoral, cross, of, st, cuthbert, was, presumably, made, before, 687, while, his, wooden, inner, coffin, incised, with, christ, and, the, evangelists, symbols, the, virgin, and, child, archangels, and, apostles, the, lindisfarne, gospels, and, the, codex, amiatinus, all, date, from, c, 700, the, fact, that, these, works, are, all, from, northumbria, might, be, held, to, reflect, the, particular, strength, of, the, church, in, that, kingdom, works, from, the, south, were, more, restrained, in, their, ornamentation, than, are, those, from, northumbria, lindisfarne, was, an, important, centre, of, book, production, along, with, ripon, and, monkwearmouth, jarrow, the, lindisfarne, gospels, might, be, the, single, most, beautiful, book, produced, in, the, middle, ages, and, the, echternach, gospels, and, probably, the, book, of, durrow, are, other, products, of, lindisfarne, a, latin, gospel, book, the, lindisfarne, gospels, are, richly, illuminated, and, decorated, in, an, insular, style, that, blends, irish, and, western, mediterranean, elements, and, incorporates, imagery, from, the, eastern, mediterranean, including, coptic, christianity, the, codex, amiatinus, was, produced, in, the, north, of, england, at, the, same, time, and, has, been, called, the, finest, book, in, the, world, it, is, certainly, one, of, the, largest, weighing, 34, kilograms, it, is, a, pandect, which, was, rare, in, the, middle, ages, and, included, all, the, books, of, the, bible, in, one, volume, the, codex, amiatinus, was, produced, at, monkwearmouth, jarrow, in, 692, under, the, direction, of, abbot, ceolfrith, bede, probably, had, something, to, do, with, it, the, production, of, the, codex, shows, the, riches, of, the, north, of, england, at, this, time, we, have, records, of, the, monastery, needing, a, new, grant, of, land, to, raise, 2, 000, more, cattle, to, get, the, calf, skins, to, make, the, vellum, for, the, manuscript, the, codex, amiatinus, was, meant, to, be, a, gift, to, the, pope, and, ceolfrith, was, taking, it, to, rome, when, he, died, on, the, way, the, copy, ended, up, in, florence, where, it, still, is, today, a, ninth, century, copy, of, this, book, is, in, the, possession, of, the, pope, in, the, 8th, century, anglo, saxon, christian, art, flourished, with, grand, decorated, manuscripts, and, sculptures, along, with, secular, works, which, bear, comparable, ornament, like, the, witham, pins, and, the, coppergate, helmet, the, flourishing, of, sculpture, in, mercia, occurred, slightly, later, than, in, northumbria, and, is, dated, to, the, second, half, of, the, 8th, century, the, book, of, cerne, is, an, early, 9th, century, insular, or, anglo, saxon, latin, personal, prayer, book, with, old, english, components, this, manuscript, was, decorated, and, embellished, with, four, painted, full, page, miniatures, major, and, minor, letters, and, continuing, panels, further, decorated, motifs, used, in, these, manuscripts, such, as, hunched, triangular, beasts, also, appear, on, objects, from, the, trewhiddle, hoard, buried, in, the, 870s, and, on, the, rings, which, bear, the, names, of, king, thelwulf, and, queen, thelswith, which, are, the, centre, of, a, small, corpus, of, fine, ninth, century, metalwork, there, was, demonstrable, continuity, in, the, south, even, though, the, danish, settlement, represented, a, watershed, in, england, s, artistic, tradition, wars, and, pillaging, removed, or, destroyed, much, anglo, saxon, art, while, the, settlement, introduced, new, scandinavian, craftsmen, and, patrons, the, result, was, to, accentuate, the, pre, existing, distinction, between, the, art, of, the, north, and, that, of, the, south, in, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, the, viking, dominated, areas, were, characterised, by, stone, sculpture, in, which, the, anglo, saxon, tradition, of, cross, shafts, took, on, new, forms, and, a, distinctive, anglo, scandinavian, monument, the, hogback, tomb, was, produced, the, decorative, motifs, used, on, these, northern, carvings, as, on, items, of, personal, adornment, or, everyday, use, echo, scandinavian, styles, the, wessexan, hegemony, and, the, monastic, reform, movement, appear, to, have, been, the, catalysts, for, the, rebirth, of, art, in, southern, england, from, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, here, artists, responded, primarily, to, continental, art, foliage, supplanting, interlace, as, the, preferred, decorative, motif, key, early, works, are, the, alfred, jewel, which, has, fleshy, leaves, engraved, on, the, back, plate, and, the, stole, and, maniples, of, bishop, frithestan, of, winchester, which, are, ornamented, with, acanthus, leaves, alongside, figures, that, bear, the, stamp, of, byzantine, art, the, surviving, evidence, points, to, winchester, and, canterbury, as, the, leading, centres, of, manuscript, art, in, the, second, half, of, the, 10th, century, they, developed, colourful, paintings, with, lavish, foliate, borders, and, coloured, line, drawings, by, the, early, 11th, century, these, two, traditions, had, fused, and, had, spread, to, other, centres, although, manuscripts, dominate, the, corpus, sufficient, architectural, sculpture, ivory, carving, and, metalwork, survives, to, show, that, the, same, styles, were, current, in, secular, art, and, became, widespread, in, the, south, at, parochial, level, the, wealth, of, england, in, the, later, tenth, and, eleventh, century, is, clearly, reflected, in, the, lavish, use, of, gold, in, manuscript, art, as, well, as, for, vessels, textiles, and, statues, now, known, only, from, descriptions, widely, admired, southern, english, art, was, highly, influential, in, normandy, france, and, flanders, from, c, 1000, indeed, keen, to, possess, it, or, recover, its, materials, the, normans, appropriated, it, in, large, quantities, in, the, wake, of, the, conquest, the, bayeux, tapestry, probably, designed, by, a, canterbury, artist, for, bishop, odo, of, bayeux, is, arguably, the, apex, of, anglo, saxon, art, surveying, nearly, 600, years, of, continuous, change, three, common, strands, stand, out, lavish, colour, and, rich, materials, an, interplay, between, abstract, ornament, and, representational, subject, matter, and, a, fusion, of, art, styles, reflecting, english, links, to, other, parts, of, europe, old, english, nglis, anglis, englis, is, the, earliest, form, of, the, english, language, it, was, brought, to, britain, by, anglo, saxon, settlers, and, was, spoken, and, written, in, parts, of, what, are, now, england, and, southeastern, scotland, until, the, mid, 12th, century, by, which, time, it, had, evolved, into, middle, english, old, english, was, a, west, germanic, language, closely, related, to, old, frisian, and, old, saxon, old, low, german, the, language, was, fully, inflected, with, five, grammatical, cases, three, grammatical, numbers, and, three, grammatical, genders, over, time, old, english, developed, into, four, major, dialects, northumbrian, spoken, north, of, the, humber, mercian, spoken, in, the, midlands, kentish, spoken, in, kent, and, west, saxon, spoken, across, the, south, and, southwest, all, of, these, dialects, have, direct, descendants, in, modern, england, standard, english, developed, from, the, mercian, dialect, as, it, was, predominant, in, london, it, is, generally, held, that, old, english, received, little, influence, from, the, common, brittonic, and, british, latin, spoken, in, southern, britain, prior, to, the, arrival, of, the, anglo, saxons, as, it, took, in, very, few, loan, words, from, these, languages, though, some, scholars, have, claimed, that, brittonic, could, have, exerted, an, influence, on, english, syntax, and, grammar, these, ideas, have, not, become, consensus, views, and, have, been, criticized, by, other, historical, linguists, richard, coates, has, concluded, that, the, strongest, candidates, for, substratal, brittonic, features, in, english, are, grammatical, elements, occurring, in, regional, dialects, in, the, north, and, west, of, england, such, as, the, northern, subject, rule, old, english, was, more, clearly, influenced, by, old, norse, scandinavian, loan, words, in, english, include, place, names, items, of, basic, vocabulary, such, as, sky, leg, and, they, and, words, concerned, with, particular, administrative, aspects, of, the, danelaw, that, is, the, area, of, land, under, viking, control, including, the, east, midlands, and, northumbria, south, of, the, tees, old, norse, was, related, to, old, english, as, both, originated, from, proto, germanic, and, many, linguists, believe, that, the, loss, of, inflectional, endings, in, old, english, was, accelerated, by, contact, with, norse, local, and, extended, kin, groups, were, a, key, aspect, of, anglo, saxon, culture, kinship, fueled, societal, advantages, freedom, and, the, relationships, to, an, elite, that, allowed, the, anglo, saxons, culture, and, language, to, flourish, the, ties, of, loyalty, to, a, lord, were, to, the, person, of, a, lord, and, not, to, his, station, there, was, no, real, concept, of, patriotism, or, loyalty, to, a, cause, this, explains, why, dynasties, waxed, and, waned, so, quickly, since, a, kingdom, was, only, as, strong, as, its, leader, king, there, was, no, underlying, administration, or, bureaucracy, to, maintain, any, gains, beyond, the, lifetime, of, a, leader, an, example, of, this, was, the, leadership, of, r, dwald, of, east, anglia, and, how, the, east, anglian, primacy, did, not, survive, his, death, kings, could, not, make, new, laws, barring, exceptional, circumstances, their, role, instead, was, to, uphold, and, clarify, previous, custom, and, to, assure, his, subjects, that, he, would, uphold, their, ancient, privileges, laws, and, customs, although, the, person, of, the, king, as, a, leader, could, be, exalted, the, office, of, kingship, was, not, in, any, sense, so, powerful, or, invested, with, authority, as, it, was, to, become, one, of, the, tools, kings, used, was, to, tie, themselves, closely, to, the, new, christian, church, through, the, practice, of, having, a, church, leader, anoint, and, crown, the, king, god, and, king, were, then, joined, in, peoples, minds, the, ties, of, kinship, meant, that, the, relatives, of, a, murdered, person, were, obliged, to, exact, vengeance, for, his, or, her, death, this, led, to, bloody, and, extensive, feuds, as, a, way, out, of, this, deadly, and, futile, custom, the, system, of, weregilds, was, instituted, the, weregild, set, a, monetary, value, on, each, person, s, life, according, to, their, wealth, and, social, status, this, value, could, also, be, used, to, set, the, fine, payable, if, a, person, was, injured, or, offended, against, robbing, a, thane, called, for, a, higher, penalty, than, robbing, a, ceorl, on, the, other, hand, a, thane, who, thieved, could, pay, a, higher, fine, than, a, ceorl, who, did, likewise, men, were, willing, to, die, for, the, lord, and, to, support, their, comitatus, their, warrior, band, evidence, of, this, behavior, though, it, may, be, more, a, literary, ideal, than, an, actual, social, practice, can, be, observed, in, the, story, made, famous, in, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, entry, for, 755, of, cynewulf, and, cyneheard, in, which, the, followers, of, a, defeated, king, decided, to, fight, to, the, death, rather, than, be, reconciled, after, the, death, of, their, lord, this, emphasis, on, social, standing, affected, all, parts, of, the, anglo, saxon, world, the, courts, for, example, did, not, attempt, to, discover, the, facts, in, a, case, instead, in, any, dispute, it, was, up, to, each, party, to, get, as, many, people, as, possible, to, swear, to, the, rightness, of, their, case, which, became, known, as, oath, swearing, the, word, of, a, thane, counted, for, that, of, six, ceorls, it, was, assumed, that, any, person, of, good, character, would, be, able, to, find, enough, people, to, swear, to, his, innocence, that, his, case, would, prosper, anglo, saxon, society, was, also, decidedly, patriarchal, but, women, were, in, some, ways, better, off, than, they, would, be, in, later, times, a, woman, could, own, property, in, her, own, right, she, could, and, did, rule, a, kingdom, if, her, husband, died, she, could, not, be, married, without, her, consent, and, any, personal, goods, including, lands, that, she, brought, into, a, marriage, remained, her, own, property, if, she, were, injured, or, abused, in, her, marriage, her, relatives, were, expected, to, look, after, her, interests, the, most, noticeable, feature, of, the, anglo, saxon, legal, system, is, the, apparent, prevalence, of, legislation, in, the, form, of, law, codes, the, early, anglo, saxons, were, organised, in, various, small, kingdoms, often, corresponding, to, later, shires, or, counties, the, kings, of, these, small, kingdoms, issued, written, laws, one, of, the, earliest, of, which, is, attributed, to, ethelbert, king, of, kent, ca, 560, 616, the, anglo, saxon, law, codes, follow, a, pattern, found, in, mainland, europe, where, other, groups, of, the, former, roman, empire, encountered, government, dependent, upon, written, sources, of, law, and, hastened, to, display, the, claims, of, their, own, native, traditions, by, reducing, them, to, writing, these, legal, systems, should, not, be, thought, of, as, operating, like, modern, legislation, rather, they, are, educational, and, political, tools, designed, to, demonstrate, standards, of, good, conduct, rather, than, act, as, criteria, for, subsequent, legal, judgment, although, not, themselves, sources, of, law, anglo, saxon, charters, are, a, most, valuable, historical, source, for, tracing, the, actual, legal, practices, of, the, various, anglo, saxon, communities, a, charter, was, a, written, document, from, a, king, or, other, authority, confirming, a, grant, either, of, land, or, some, other, valuable, right, their, prevalence, in, the, anglo, saxon, state, is, a, sign, of, sophistication, they, were, frequently, appealed, to, and, relied, upon, in, litigation, making, grants, and, confirming, those, made, by, others, was, a, major, way, in, which, anglo, saxon, kings, demonstrated, their, authority, the, royal, council, or, witan, played, a, central, but, limited, role, in, the, anglo, saxon, period, the, main, feature, of, the, system, was, its, high, degree, of, decentralisation, the, interference, by, the, king, through, his, granting, of, charters, and, the, activity, of, his, witan, in, litigation, are, exceptions, rather, than, the, rule, in, anglo, saxon, times, the, most, important, court, in, the, later, anglo, saxon, period, was, the, shire, court, many, shires, such, as, kent, and, sussex, were, in, the, early, days, of, the, anglo, saxon, settlement, the, centre, of, small, independent, kingdoms, as, the, kings, first, of, mercia, and, then, of, wessex, slowly, extended, their, authority, over, the, whole, of, england, they, left, the, shire, courts, with, overall, responsibility, for, the, administration, of, law, the, shire, met, in, one, or, more, traditional, places, earlier, in, the, open, air, and, then, later, in, a, moot, or, meeting, hall, the, meeting, of, the, shire, court, was, presided, over, by, an, officer, the, shire, reeve, or, sheriff, whose, appointment, came, in, later, anglo, saxon, times, into, the, hands, of, the, king, but, had, in, earlier, times, been, elective, the, sheriff, was, not, the, judge, of, the, court, merely, its, president, the, judges, of, the, court, were, all, those, who, had, the, right, and, duty, of, attending, the, court, the, suitors, these, were, originally, all, free, male, inhabitants, of, the, neighbourhood, but, over, time, suit, of, court, became, an, obligation, attached, to, particular, holdings, of, land, the, sessions, of, a, shire, court, resembled, more, closely, those, of, a, modern, local, administrative, body, than, a, modern, court, it, could, and, did, act, judicially, but, this, was, not, its, prime, function, in, the, shire, court, charters, and, writs, would, be, read, out, for, all, to, hear, below, the, level, of, the, shire, each, county, was, divided, into, areas, known, as, hundreds, or, wapentakes, in, the, north, of, england, these, were, originally, groups, of, families, rather, than, geographical, areas, the, hundred, court, was, a, smaller, version, of, the, shire, court, presided, over, by, the, hundred, bailiff, formerly, a, sheriff, s, appointment, but, over, the, years, many, hundreds, fell, into, the, private, hands, of, a, local, large, landowner, little, is, known, about, hundred, court, business, which, was, likely, a, mix, of, the, administrative, and, judicial, but, they, remained, in, some, areas, an, important, forum, for, the, settlement, of, local, disputes, well, into, the, post, conquest, period, the, anglo, saxon, system, put, an, emphasis, upon, compromise, and, arbitration, litigating, parties, were, enjoined, to, settle, their, differences, if, possible, if, they, persisted, in, bringing, a, case, for, decision, before, a, shire, court, then, it, could, be, determined, there, the, suitors, of, the, court, would, pronounce, a, judgment, which, fixed, how, the, case, would, be, decided, legal, problems, were, considered, to, be, too, complex, and, difficult, for, mere, human, decision, and, so, proof, or, demonstration, of, the, right, would, depend, upon, some, irrational, non, human, criterion, the, normal, methods, of, proof, were, oath, helping, or, the, ordeal, oath, helping, involved, the, party, undergoing, proof, swearing, to, the, truth, of, his, claim, or, denial, and, having, that, oath, reinforced, by, five, or, more, others, chosen, either, by, the, party, or, by, the, court, the, number, of, helpers, required, and, the, form, of, their, oath, differed, from, place, to, place, and, upon, the, nature, of, the, dispute, if, either, the, party, or, any, of, the, helpers, failed, in, the, oath, either, refusing, to, take, it, or, sometimes, even, making, an, error, in, the, required, formula, the, proof, failed, and, the, case, was, adjudged, to, the, other, side, as, wager, of, law, it, remained, a, way, of, determining, cases, in, the, common, law, until, its, abolition, in, the, 19th, century, the, ordeal, offered, an, alternative, for, those, unable, or, unwilling, to, swear, an, oath, the, two, most, common, methods, were, the, ordeal, by, hot, iron, and, by, cold, water, the, former, consisted, in, carrying, a, red, hot, iron, for, five, paces, the, wound, was, immediately, bound, up, and, if, on, unbinding, it, was, found, to, be, festering, the, case, was, lost, in, the, ordeal, by, water, the, victim, usually, an, accused, person, was, cast, bound, into, water, if, he, sunk, he, was, innocent, if, he, floated, he, was, guilty, although, for, perhaps, understandable, reasons, the, ordeals, became, associated, with, trials, in, criminal, matters, they, were, in, essence, tests, of, the, truth, of, a, claim, or, denial, of, a, party, and, appropriate, for, trying, any, legal, issue, the, allocation, of, a, mode, of, proof, and, who, should, bear, it, was, the, substance, of, the, shire, court, s, judgment, old, english, literary, works, include, genres, such, as, epic, poetry, hagiography, sermons, bible, translations, legal, works, chronicles, riddles, and, others, in, all, there, are, about, 400, surviving, manuscripts, from, the, period, a, significant, corpus, of, both, popular, interest, and, specialist, research, the, manuscripts, use, a, modified, roman, alphabet, but, anglo, saxon, runes, or, futhorc, are, used, in, under, 200, inscriptions, on, objects, sometimes, mixed, with, roman, letters, this, literature, is, remarkable, for, being, in, the, vernacular, old, english, in, the, early, medieval, period, almost, all, other, written, literature, in, western, europe, was, in, latin, at, this, time, but, because, of, alfred, s, programme, of, vernacular, literacy, the, oral, traditions, of, anglo, saxon, england, ended, up, being, converted, into, writing, and, preserved, much, of, this, preservation, can, be, attributed, to, the, monks, of, the, tenth, century, who, made, at, the, very, least, the, copies, of, most, of, the, literary, manuscripts, that, still, exist, manuscripts, were, not, common, items, they, were, expensive, and, hard, to, make, first, cows, or, sheep, had, to, be, slaughtered, and, their, skins, tanned, the, leather, was, then, scraped, stretched, and, cut, into, sheets, which, were, sewn, into, books, then, inks, had, to, be, made, from, oak, galls, and, other, ingredients, and, the, books, had, to, be, hand, written, by, monks, using, quill, pens, every, manuscript, is, slightly, different, from, another, even, if, they, are, copies, of, each, other, because, every, scribe, had, different, handwriting, and, made, different, errors, individual, scribes, can, sometimes, be, identified, from, their, handwriting, and, different, styles, of, hand, were, used, in, specific, scriptoria, centres, of, manuscript, production, so, the, location, of, the, manuscript, production, can, often, be, identified, there, are, four, great, poetic, codices, of, old, english, poetry, a, codex, is, a, book, in, modern, format, as, opposed, to, a, scroll, the, junius, manuscript, the, vercelli, book, the, exeter, book, and, the, nowell, codex, or, beowulf, manuscript, most, of, the, well, known, lyric, poems, such, as, the, wanderer, the, seafarer, deor, and, the, ruin, are, found, in, the, exeter, book, while, the, vercelli, book, has, the, dream, of, the, rood, some, of, which, is, also, carved, on, the, ruthwell, cross, the, franks, casket, also, has, carved, riddles, a, popular, form, with, the, anglo, saxons, old, english, secular, poetry, is, mostly, characterized, by, a, somewhat, gloomy, and, introspective, cast, of, mind, and, the, grim, determination, found, in, the, battle, of, maldon, recounting, an, action, against, the, vikings, in, 991, this, is, from, a, book, that, was, lost, in, the, cotton, library, fire, of, 1731, but, it, had, been, transcribed, previously, rather, than, being, organized, around, rhyme, the, poetic, line, in, anglo, saxon, is, organised, around, alliteration, the, repetition, of, stressed, sounds, any, repeated, stressed, sound, vowel, or, consonant, could, be, used, anglo, saxon, lines, are, made, up, of, two, half, lines, in, old, fashioned, scholarship, these, are, called, hemistiches, divided, by, a, breath, pause, or, caesura, there, must, be, at, least, one, of, the, alliterating, sounds, on, each, side, of, the, caesura, hr, eran, mid, hondum, hr, imcealde, s, the, line, above, illustrates, the, principle, note, that, there, is, a, natural, pause, after, hondum, and, that, the, first, stressed, syllable, after, that, pause, begins, with, the, same, sound, as, a, stressed, line, from, the, first, half, line, the, first, halfline, is, called, the, a, verse, and, the, second, is, the, b, verse, there, is, very, strong, evidence, that, anglo, saxon, poetry, has, deep, roots, in, oral, tradition, but, keeping, with, the, cultural, practices, seen, elsewhere, in, anglo, saxon, culture, there, was, a, blending, between, tradition, and, new, learning, thus, while, all, old, english, poetry, has, common, features, three, strands, can, be, identified, religious, poetry, which, includes, poems, about, specifically, christian, topics, such, as, the, cross, and, the, saints, heroic, or, epic, poetry, such, as, beowulf, which, is, about, heroes, warfare, monsters, and, the, germanic, past, and, poetry, about, smaller, topics, including, introspective, poems, the, so, called, elegies, wisdom, poems, which, communicate, both, traditional, and, christian, wisdom, and, riddles, for, a, long, time, all, anglo, saxon, poetry, was, divided, into, three, groups, c, dmonian, the, biblical, paraphrase, poems, heroic, and, cynewulfian, named, after, cynewulf, one, of, the, few, named, poets, in, anglo, saxon, the, most, famous, works, from, this, period, include, the, epic, poem, beowulf, which, has, achieved, national, epic, status, in, britain, there, are, about, 30, 000, surviving, lines, of, old, english, poetry, and, about, ten, times, that, much, prose, and, the, majority, of, both, is, religious, the, prose, was, influential, and, obviously, very, important, to, the, anglo, saxons, and, more, important, than, the, poetry, to, those, who, came, after, the, anglo, saxons, homilies, are, sermons, lessons, to, be, given, on, moral, and, doctrinal, matters, and, the, two, most, prolific, and, respected, writers, of, anglo, saxon, prose, lfric, and, wulfstan, were, both, homilists, almost, all, surviving, poetry, is, found, in, only, one, manuscript, copy, but, there, are, several, versions, of, some, prose, works, especially, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, which, was, apparently, promulgated, to, monasteries, by, the, royal, court, anglo, saxon, clergy, also, continued, to, write, in, latin, the, language, of, bede, s, works, monastic, chronicles, and, theological, writing, although, bede, s, biographer, records, that, he, was, familiar, with, old, english, poetry, and, gives, a, five, line, lyric, which, he, either, wrote, or, liked, to, quote, the, sense, is, unclear, symbolism, was, an, essential, element, in, anglo, saxon, culture, julian, d, richards, suggests, that, in, societies, with, strong, oral, traditions, material, culture, is, used, to, store, and, pass, on, information, and, stand, instead, of, literature, in, those, cultures, this, symbolism, is, less, logical, than, literature, and, more, difficult, to, read, anglo, saxons, used, symbolism, to, communicate, as, well, as, to, aid, their, thinking, about, the, world, anglo, saxons, used, symbols, to, differentiate, between, groups, and, people, status, and, role, in, society, the, visual, riddles, and, ambiguities, of, early, anglo, saxon, animal, art, for, example, has, been, seen, as, emphasising, the, protective, roles, of, animals, on, dress, accessories, weapons, armour, and, horse, equipment, and, its, evocation, of, pre, christian, mythological, themes, however, howard, williams, and, ruth, nugent, have, suggested, that, the, number, of, artefact, categories, that, have, animals, or, eyes, from, pots, to, combs, buckets, to, weaponry, was, to, make, artefacts, see, by, impressing, and, punching, circular, and, lentoid, shapes, onto, them, this, symbolism, of, making, the, object, seems, to, be, more, than, decoration, conventional, interpretations, of, the, symbolism, of, grave, goods, revolved, around, religion, equipment, for, the, hereafter, legal, concepts, inalienable, possessions, and, social, structure, status, display, ostentatious, destruction, of, wealth, there, was, multiplicity, of, messages, and, variability, of, meanings, characterised, the, deposition, of, objects, in, anglo, saxon, graves, in, early, anglo, saxon, cemeteries, 47, of, male, adults, and, 9, of, all, juveniles, were, buried, with, weapons, the, proportion, of, adult, weapon, burials, is, much, too, high, to, suggest, that, they, all, represent, a, social, elite, the, usual, assumption, is, that, these, are, warrior, burials, and, this, term, is, used, throughout, the, archaeological, and, historical, literature, however, a, systematic, comparison, of, burials, with, and, without, weapons, using, archaeological, and, skeletal, data, suggests, that, this, assumption, is, much, too, simplistic, and, even, misleading, anglo, saxon, weapon, burial, rite, involved, a, complex, ritual, symbolism, it, was, multi, dimensional, displaying, ethnic, affiliation, descent, wealth, lite, status, and, age, groups, this, symbol, continued, until, c, 700, when, it, ceased, to, have, the, symbolic, power, that, it, had, before, heinrich, h, rke, suggests, this, change, was, the, result, of, the, changing, structure, of, society, and, especially, in, ethnicity, and, assimilation, implying, the, lowering, of, ethnic, boundaries, in, the, anglo, saxon, settlement, areas, of, england, towards, a, common, culture, the, word, bead, comes, from, the, anglo, saxon, words, bidden, to, pray, and, bede, prayer, the, vast, majority, of, early, anglo, saxon, female, graves, contain, beads, which, are, often, found, in, large, numbers, in, the, area, of, the, neck, and, chest, beads, are, sometimes, found, in, male, burials, with, large, beads, often, associated, with, prestigious, weapons, a, variety, of, materials, other, than, glass, were, available, for, anglo, saxon, beads, including, amber, rock, crystal, amethyst, bone, shells, coral, and, even, metal, these, beads, are, usually, considered, to, have, a, social, or, ritual, function, anglo, saxon, glass, beads, show, a, wide, variety, of, bead, manufacturing, techniques, sizes, shapes, colours, and, decorations, various, studies, have, been, carried, out, investigating, the, distribution, and, chronological, change, of, bead, types, the, crystal, beads, which, appear, on, bead, strings, in, the, pagan, anglo, saxon, period, seems, to, have, gone, through, various, changes, in, meaning, in, the, christian, period, which, gale, owen, crocker, suggests, was, linked, to, symbolism, of, the, virgin, mary, and, hence, to, intercession, john, hines, has, suggested, that, the, over, 2, 000, different, types, of, beads, found, at, lakenheath, show, that, the, beads, symbolise, identity, roles, status, and, micro, cultures, within, the, tribal, landscape, of, the, early, anglo, saxon, world, symbolism, continued, to, have, a, hold, on, the, minds, of, anglo, saxon, people, into, the, christian, eras, the, interiors, of, churches, would, have, glowed, with, colour, and, the, walls, of, the, halls, were, painted, with, decorative, scenes, from, the, imagination, telling, stories, of, monsters, and, heroes, like, those, in, the, poem, beowulf, although, nothing, much, is, left, of, the, wall, paintings, evidence, of, their, pictorial, art, is, found, in, bibles, and, psalters, in, illuminated, manuscripts, the, poem, the, dream, of, the, rood, is, an, example, how, symbolism, of, trees, was, fused, into, christian, symbolism, richard, north, suggests, that, the, sacrifice, of, the, tree, was, in, accordance, with, pagan, virtues, and, the, image, of, christ, s, death, was, constructed, in, this, poem, with, reference, to, an, anglian, ideology, of, the, world, tree, north, suggests, that, the, author, of, the, dream, of, the, rood, uses, the, language, of, the, myth, of, ingui, in, order, to, present, the, passion, to, his, newly, christianized, countrymen, as, a, story, from, their, native, tradition, furthermore, the, tree, s, triumph, over, death, is, celebrated, by, adorning, the, cross, with, gold, and, jewels, the, most, distinctive, feature, of, coinage, of, the, first, half, of, the, 8th, century, is, its, portrayal, of, animals, to, an, extent, found, in, no, other, european, coinage, of, the, early, middle, ages, some, animals, such, as, lions, or, peacocks, would, have, been, known, in, england, only, through, descriptions, in, texts, or, through, images, in, manuscripts, or, on, portable, objects, the, animals, were, not, merely, illustrated, out, of, an, interest, in, the, natural, world, each, was, imbued, with, meanings, and, acted, as, a, symbol, which, would, have, been, understood, at, the, time, the, food, eaten, by, anglo, saxons, was, long, presumed, to, differ, between, elites, and, commoners, however, a, 2022, study, by, the, university, of, cambridge, found, that, anglo, saxon, elites, and, royalty, both, ate, a, primarily, vegetarian, diet, based, on, cereal, grains, as, did, peasants, the, discovery, came, after, bioarchaeologist, sam, leggett, analysed, chemical, dietary, signatures, from, the, bones, of, 2, 023, people, buried, in, england, between, the, 5th, to, 11th, centuries, and, cross, referenced, the, analysis, with, markers, of, social, status, rather, than, elites, eating, regular, banquets, with, huge, quantities, of, meat, the, researchers, concluded, these, were, occasional, grand, feasts, hosted, by, the, peasants, for, their, rulers, rather, than, regular, occurrences, anglo, saxon, is, still, used, as, a, term, for, the, original, old, english, derived, vocabulary, within, the, modern, english, language, in, contrast, to, vocabulary, derived, from, old, norse, and, french, in, the, 19th, century, the, term, anglo, saxon, was, broadly, used, in, philology, and, is, sometimes, so, used, at, present, though, the, term, old, english, is, more, commonly, used, for, the, language, throughout, the, history, of, anglo, saxon, studies, different, historical, narratives, about, the, post, roman, people, of, britain, and, ireland, have, been, used, to, justify, contemporary, ideologies, in, the, early, middle, ages, the, views, of, geoffrey, of, monmouth, produced, a, personally, inspired, and, largely, fictitious, history, that, was, not, challenged, for, some, 500, years, in, the, reformation, christians, looking, to, establish, an, independent, english, church, reinterpreted, anglo, saxon, christianity, during, the, victorian, era, writers, such, as, robert, knox, james, anthony, froude, charles, kingsley, and, edward, a, freeman, used, the, term, anglo, saxon, to, justify, colonialistic, imperialism, claiming, that, anglo, saxon, heritage, was, superior, to, those, held, by, colonised, peoples, which, justified, efforts, to, civilise, them, similar, racist, ideas, were, advocated, in, the, 19th, century, united, states, by, samuel, george, morton, and, george, fitzhugh, the, historian, catherine, hills, contends, that, these, views, have, influenced, how, versions, of, early, english, history, are, embedded, in, the, sub, conscious, of, certain, people, and, are, re, emerging, in, school, textbooks, and, television, programmes, and, still, very, congenial, to, some, strands, of, political, thinking, the, term, anglo, saxon, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, a, broader, group, of, peoples, descended, or, associated, in, some, way, with, the, english, ethnic, group, in, ways, which, go, beyond, language, and, often, involve, ideas, about, religion, in, contemporary, anglophone, cultures, outside, britain, for, example, anglo, saxon, ancestry, and, culture, is, sometimes, contrasted, with, irish, ancestry, and, culture, which, was, once, subject, to, negative, stereotyping, and, bigotry, white, anglo, saxon, protestant, wasp, is, a, term, especially, popular, in, the, united, states, that, refers, chiefly, to, long, established, wealthy, families, with, mostly, english, but, also, sometimes, scottish, dutch, or, german, ancestors, as, such, wasp, is, not, a, historical, label, or, a, precise, ethnological, term, but, rather, a, reference, to, contemporary, family, based, political, financial, and, cultural, power, e, g, the, boston, brahmin, the, term, anglo, saxon, is, becoming, increasingly, controversial, among, some, scholars, especially, those, in, america, for, its, modern, politicised, nature, and, adoption, by, the, far, right, in, 2019, the, international, society, of, anglo, saxonists, changed, their, name, to, the, international, society, for, the, study, of, early, medieval, england, in, recognition, of, this, controversy, the, russian, government, under, vladimir, putin, and, russian, state, run, media, often, use, anglo, saxon, as, a, derogatory, term, referring, to, english, speaking, countries, particularly, the, united, states, and, united, kingdom
