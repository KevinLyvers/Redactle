xiang, the, latter, composed, of, a, group, of, hamlets, li, each, containing, about, a, hundred, families, the, heads, of, provinces, whose, official, title, was, changed, from, inspector, to, governor, and, vice, versa, several, times, during, han, were, responsible, for, inspecting, several, commandery, level, and, kingdom, level, administrations, on, the, basis, of, their, reports, the, officials, in, these, local, administrations, would, be, promoted, demoted, dismissed, or, prosecuted, by, the, imperial, court, a, governor, could, take, various, actions, without, permission, from, the, imperial, court, the, lower, ranked, inspector, had, executive, powers, only, during, times, of, crisis, such, as, raising, militias, across, the, commanderies, under, his, jurisdiction, to, suppress, a, rebellion, a, commandery, consisted, of, a, group, of, counties, and, was, headed, by, an, administrator, he, was, the, top, civil, and, military, leader, of, the, commandery, and, handled, defence, lawsuits, seasonal, instructions, to, farmers, and, recommendations, of, nominees, for, office, sent, annually, to, the, capital, in, a, quota, system, first, established, by, emperor, wu, the, head, of, a, large, county, of, about, 10, 000, households, was, called, a, prefect, while, the, heads, of, smaller, counties, were, called, chiefs, and, both, could, be, referred, to, as, magistrates, a, magistrate, maintained, law, and, order, in, his, county, registered, the, populace, for, taxation, mobilized, commoners, for, annual, corv, e, duties, repaired, schools, and, supervised, public, works, kingdoms, roughly, the, size, of, commanderies, were, ruled, exclusively, by, the, emperor, s, male, relatives, as, semi, autonomous, fiefdoms, before, 157, bc, some, kingdoms, were, ruled, by, non, relatives, granted, to, them, in, return, for, their, services, to, emperor, gaozu, the, administration, of, each, kingdom, was, very, similar, to, that, of, the, central, government, although, the, emperor, appointed, the, chancellor, of, each, kingdom, kings, appointed, all, the, remaining, civil, officials, in, their, fiefs, however, in, 145, bc, after, several, insurrections, by, the, kings, emperor, jing, removed, the, kings, rights, to, appoint, officials, whose, salaries, were, higher, than, 400, bushels, the, imperial, counsellors, and, nine, ministers, excluding, the, minister, coachman, of, every, kingdom, were, abolished, although, the, chancellor, was, still, appointed, by, the, central, government, with, these, reforms, kings, were, reduced, to, being, nominal, heads, of, their, fiefs, gaining, a, personal, income, from, only, a, portion, of, the, taxes, collected, in, their, kingdom, similarly, the, officials, in, the, administrative, staff, of, a, full, marquess, s, fief, were, appointed, by, the, central, government, a, marquess, s, chancellor, was, ranked, as, the, equivalent, of, a, county, prefect, like, a, king, the, marquess, collected, a, portion, of, the, tax, revenues, in, his, fief, as, personal, income, until, the, reign, of, emperor, jing, of, han, the, han, emperors, had, great, difficulties, controlling, their, vassal, kings, who, often, switched, allegiances, to, the, xiongnu, whenever, they, felt, threatened, by, imperial, centralization, of, power, the, seven, years, of, gaozu, s, reign, featured, defections, by, three, vassal, kings, and, one, marquess, who, then, aligned, themselves, with, the, xiongnu, even, imperial, princes, controlling, fiefdoms, would, sometimes, invite, a, xiongnu, invasion, in, response, to, the, emperor, s, threats, the, han, moved, to, secure, a, treaty, with, the, xiongnu, aiming, to, clearly, divide, authority, between, them, the, han, and, xiongnu, now, held, one, another, out, as, the, two, masters, with, sole, dominion, over, their, respective, peoples, they, cemented, this, agreement, with, a, marriage, alliance, heqin, before, eliminating, the, rebellious, vassal, kings, in, 154, bc, this, prompted, some, of, the, xiongnu, vassals, to, swap, allegiances, to, the, han, starting, in, 147, han, court, officials, were, initially, hostile, to, the, idea, of, disrupting, the, status, quo, by, expanding, into, xiongnu, territory, in, the, steppe, the, surrendered, xiongnu, were, integrated, into, a, parallel, military, and, political, structures, loyal, to, the, han, emperor, a, step, toward, a, potential, han, challenge, to, the, superiority, of, xiongnu, cavalry, in, steppe, warfare, this, also, brought, the, han, into, contact, with, the, interstate, trade, networks, through, the, tarim, basin, in, the, far, northwest, allowing, for, the, han, s, expansion, from, a, regional, state, to, a, universalist, cosmopolitan, empire, achieved, in, part, through, further, marriage, alliances, with, the, wusun, another, steppe, power, at, the, beginning, of, the, han, every, male, commoner, aged, twenty, three, was, liable, for, conscription, into, the, military, the, minimum, age, was, reduced, to, twenty, following, the, reign, of, emperor, zhao, r, 87, 74, conscripted, soldiers, underwent, one, year, of, training, and, one, year, of, service, as, non, professional, soldiers, the, year, of, training, was, spent, in, one, of, three, branches, of, the, armed, forces, infantry, cavalry, or, navy, prior, to, the, abolition, of, much, of, the, conscription, system, after, 30, ad, soldiers, could, be, called, up, for, future, service, following, the, completion, of, their, terms, they, had, to, continue, training, regularly, to, maintain, their, skills, and, were, subject, to, annual, inspections, of, their, military, readiness, the, year, of, active, service, was, served, either, on, the, frontier, in, a, king, s, court, or, in, the, capital, under, the, minister, of, the, guards, a, small, professional, army, was, stationed, near, the, capital, during, the, eastern, han, conscription, could, be, avoided, if, one, paid, a, commutable, tax, the, eastern, han, court, favoured, the, recruitment, of, a, volunteer, army, the, volunteer, army, comprised, the, southern, army, nanjun, while, the, standing, army, stationed, in, and, near, the, capital, was, the, northern, army, beijun, led, by, colonels, xiaowei, the, northern, army, consisted, of, five, regiments, each, composed, of, several, thousand, soldiers, when, central, authority, collapsed, after, 189, ad, wealthy, landowners, members, of, the, aristocracy, nobility, and, regional, military, governors, relied, upon, their, retainers, to, act, as, their, own, personal, troops, during, times, of, war, the, volunteer, army, was, increased, and, a, much, larger, militia, was, raised, across, the, country, to, supplement, the, northern, army, in, these, circumstances, a, general, jiangjun, led, a, division, which, was, divided, into, regiments, led, by, a, colonel, or, major, sima, regiments, were, divided, into, companies, and, led, by, captains, platoons, were, the, smallest, units, the, han, dynasty, inherited, the, ban, liang, coin, type, from, the, qin, in, the, beginning, of, the, han, emperor, gaozu, closed, the, government, mint, in, favour, of, private, minting, of, coins, this, decision, was, reversed, in, 186, bc, by, his, widow, grand, empress, dowager, l, zhi, d, 180, bc, who, abolished, private, minting, in, 182, bc, l, zhi, issued, a, bronze, coin, that, was, much, lighter, in, weight, than, previous, coins, this, caused, widespread, inflation, that, was, not, reduced, until, 175, bc, when, emperor, wen, allowed, private, minters, to, manufacture, coins, that, were, precisely, 2, 6, g, 0, 092, oz, in, weight, in, 144, bc, emperor, jing, abolished, private, minting, in, favour, of, central, government, and, commandery, level, minting, he, also, introduced, a, new, coin, emperor, wu, introduced, another, in, 120, bc, but, a, year, later, he, abandoned, the, ban, liangs, entirely, in, favour, of, the, wuzhu, coin, weighing, 3, 2, g, 0, 11, oz, the, wuzhu, became, china, s, standard, coin, until, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, its, use, was, interrupted, briefly, by, several, new, currencies, introduced, during, wang, mang, s, regime, until, it, was, reinstated, in, 40, ad, by, emperor, guangwu, since, commandery, issued, coins, were, often, of, inferior, quality, and, lighter, weight, the, central, government, closed, commandery, mints, and, monopolized, the, issue, of, coinage, in, 113, bc, this, central, government, issuance, of, coinage, was, overseen, by, the, superintendent, of, waterways, and, parks, this, duty, being, transferred, to, the, minister, of, finance, during, the, eastern, han, aside, from, the, landowner, s, land, tax, paid, in, a, portion, of, their, crop, yield, the, poll, tax, and, property, taxes, were, paid, in, coin, cash, the, annual, poll, tax, rate, for, adult, men, and, women, was, 120, coins, and, 20, coins, for, minors, merchants, were, required, to, pay, a, higher, rate, of, 240, coins, the, poll, tax, stimulated, a, money, economy, that, necessitated, the, minting, of, over, 28, 000, 000, 000, coins, from, 118, bc, to, 5, ad, an, average, of, 220, 000, 000, coins, a, year, the, widespread, circulation, of, coin, cash, allowed, successful, merchants, to, invest, money, in, land, empowering, the, very, social, class, the, government, attempted, to, suppress, through, heavy, commercial, and, property, taxes, emperor, wu, even, enacted, laws, which, banned, registered, merchants, from, owning, land, yet, powerful, merchants, were, able, to, avoid, registration, and, own, large, tracts, of, land, the, small, landowner, cultivators, formed, the, majority, of, the, han, tax, base, this, revenue, was, threatened, during, the, latter, half, of, eastern, han, when, many, peasants, fell, into, debt, and, were, forced, to, work, as, farming, tenants, for, wealthy, landlords, the, han, government, enacted, reforms, in, order, to, keep, small, landowner, cultivators, out, of, debt, and, on, their, own, farms, these, reforms, included, reducing, taxes, temporary, remissions, of, taxes, granting, loans, and, providing, landless, peasants, temporary, lodging, and, work, in, agricultural, colonies, until, they, could, recover, from, their, debts, in, 168, bc, the, land, tax, rate, was, reduced, from, one, fifteenth, of, a, farming, household, s, crop, yield, to, one, thirtieth, and, later, to, one, hundredth, of, a, crop, yield, for, the, last, decades, of, the, dynasty, the, consequent, loss, of, government, revenue, was, compensated, for, by, increasing, property, taxes, the, labour, tax, took, the, form, of, conscripted, labour, for, one, month, per, year, which, was, imposed, upon, male, commoners, aged, fifteen, to, fifty, six, this, could, be, avoided, in, eastern, han, with, a, commutable, tax, since, hired, labour, became, more, popular, in, the, early, western, han, a, wealthy, salt, or, iron, industrialist, whether, a, semi, autonomous, king, or, wealthy, merchant, could, boast, funds, that, rivalled, the, imperial, treasury, and, amass, a, peasant, workforce, numbering, in, the, thousands, this, kept, many, peasants, away, from, their, farms, and, denied, the, government, a, significant, portion, of, its, land, tax, revenue, to, eliminate, the, influence, of, such, private, entrepreneurs, emperor, wu, nationalized, the, salt, and, iron, industries, in, 117, bc, and, allowed, many, of, the, former, industrialists, to, become, officials, administering, the, state, monopolies, by, the, eastern, han, the, central, government, monopolies, were, repealed, in, favour, of, production, by, commandery, and, county, administrations, as, well, as, private, businessmen, liquor, was, another, profitable, private, industry, nationalized, by, the, central, government, in, 98, bc, however, this, was, repealed, in, 81, bc, and, a, property, tax, rate, of, two, coins, for, every, 0, 2, litres, 0, 053, us, gal, was, levied, for, those, who, traded, it, privately, by, 110, bc, emperor, wu, also, interfered, with, the, profitable, trade, in, grain, when, he, eliminated, speculation, by, selling, government, stores, of, grain, at, a, lower, price, than, that, demanded, by, merchants, apart, from, emperor, ming, s, creation, of, a, short, lived, office, for, price, adjustment, and, stabilization, which, was, abolished, in, 68, ad, central, government, price, control, regulations, were, largely, absent, during, the, eastern, han, the, han, dynasty, was, a, unique, period, in, the, development, of, premodern, chinese, science, and, technology, comparable, to, the, level, of, scientific, and, technological, growth, during, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, in, the, 1st, millennium, bc, typical, ancient, chinese, writing, materials, were, bronzeware, oracle, bones, and, bamboo, slips, or, wooden, boards, by, the, beginning, of, the, han, the, chief, writing, materials, were, clay, tablets, silk, cloth, hemp, paper, and, rolled, scrolls, made, from, bamboo, strips, sewn, together, with, hempen, string, these, were, passed, through, drilled, holes, and, secured, with, clay, stamps, the, oldest, known, chinese, piece, of, hempen, paper, dates, to, the, 2nd, century, bc, the, standard, papermaking, process, was, invented, by, cai, lun, ad, 50, 121, in, 105, the, oldest, known, surviving, piece, of, paper, with, writing, on, it, was, found, in, the, ruins, of, a, han, watchtower, that, had, been, abandoned, in, ad, 110, in, inner, mongolia, evidence, suggests, that, blast, furnaces, that, convert, raw, iron, ore, into, pig, iron, which, can, be, remelted, in, a, cupola, furnace, to, produce, cast, iron, by, means, of, a, cold, blast, and, hot, blast, were, operational, in, china, by, the, late, spring, and, autumn, period, 722, 481, bc, the, bloomery, was, non, existent, in, ancient, china, however, the, han, era, chinese, produced, wrought, iron, by, injecting, excess, oxygen, into, a, furnace, and, causing, decarburisation, cast, iron, and, pig, iron, could, be, converted, into, wrought, iron, and, steel, using, a, fining, process, the, han, dynasty, chinese, used, bronze, and, iron, to, make, a, range, of, weapons, culinary, tools, carpenters, tools, and, domestic, wares, a, significant, product, of, these, improved, iron, smelting, techniques, was, the, manufacture, of, new, agricultural, tools, the, three, legged, iron, seed, drill, invented, by, the, 2nd, century, bc, enabled, farmers, to, carefully, plant, crops, in, rows, instead, of, sowing, seeds, by, hand, the, heavy, mouldboard, iron, plough, also, invented, during, the, han, required, only, one, man, to, control, it, with, two, oxen, to, pull, it, it, had, three, ploughshares, a, seed, box, for, the, drills, a, tool, which, turned, down, the, soil, and, could, sow, roughly, 45, 730, m, 2, 492, 200, sq, ft, of, land, in, a, single, day, to, protect, crops, from, wind, and, drought, the, grain, intendant, zhao, guo, created, the, alternating, fields, system, daitianfa, during, emperor, wu, s, reign, this, system, switched, the, positions, of, furrows, and, ridges, between, growing, seasons, once, experiments, with, this, system, yielded, successful, results, the, government, officially, sponsored, it, and, encouraged, peasants, to, use, it, han, farmers, also, used, the, pit, field, system, aotian, for, growing, crops, which, involved, heavily, fertilized, pits, that, did, not, require, ploughs, or, oxen, and, could, be, placed, on, sloping, terrain, in, the, southern, and, small, parts, of, central, han, era, china, paddy, fields, were, chiefly, used, to, grow, rice, while, farmers, along, the, huai, river, used, transplantation, methods, of, rice, production, timber, was, the, chief, building, material, during, the, han, it, was, used, to, build, palace, halls, multi, story, residential, towers, and, halls, and, single, story, houses, because, wood, decays, rapidly, the, only, remaining, evidence, of, han, wooden, architecture, is, a, collection, of, scattered, ceramic, roof, tiles, the, oldest, surviving, wooden, halls, in, china, date, to, the, tang, dynasty, architectural, historian, robert, l, thorp, points, out, the, scarcity, of, han, era, archaeological, remains, and, claims, that, often, unreliable, han, era, literary, and, artistic, sources, are, used, by, historians, for, clues, about, lost, han, architecture, though, han, wooden, structures, decayed, some, han, dynasty, ruins, made, of, brick, stone, and, rammed, earth, remain, intact, this, includes, stone, pillar, gates, brick, tomb, chambers, rammed, earth, city, walls, rammed, earth, and, brick, beacon, towers, rammed, earth, sections, of, the, great, wall, rammed, earth, platforms, where, elevated, halls, once, stood, and, two, rammed, earth, castles, in, gansu, the, ruins, of, rammed, earth, walls, that, once, surrounded, the, capitals, chang, an, and, luoyang, still, stand, along, with, their, drainage, systems, of, brick, arches, ditches, and, ceramic, water, pipes, monumental, stone, pillar, gates, twenty, nine, of, which, survive, from, the, han, period, formed, entrances, of, walled, enclosures, at, shrine, and, tomb, sites, these, pillars, feature, artistic, imitations, of, wooden, and, ceramic, building, components, such, as, roof, tiles, eaves, and, balustrades, the, courtyard, house, is, the, most, common, type, of, home, portrayed, in, han, artwork, ceramic, architectural, models, of, buildings, like, houses, and, towers, were, found, in, han, tombs, perhaps, to, provide, lodging, for, the, dead, in, the, afterlife, these, provide, valuable, clues, about, lost, wooden, architecture, the, artistic, designs, found, on, ceramic, roof, tiles, of, tower, models, are, in, some, cases, exact, matches, to, han, roof, tiles, found, at, archaeological, sites, over, ten, han, era, underground, tombs, have, been, found, many, of, them, featuring, archways, vaulted, chambers, and, domed, roofs, underground, vaults, and, domes, did, not, require, buttress, supports, since, they, were, held, in, place, by, earthen, pits, the, use, of, brick, vaults, and, domes, in, aboveground, han, structures, is, unknown, from, han, literary, sources, it, is, known, that, wooden, trestle, beam, bridges, arch, bridges, simple, suspension, bridges, and, floating, pontoon, bridges, existed, during, the, han, however, there, are, only, two, known, references, to, arch, bridges, in, han, literature, there, is, only, one, relief, sculpture, dated, to, the, han, period, that, depicts, an, arch, bridge, it, is, located, in, sichuan, province, underground, mine, shafts, some, reaching, depths, over, 100, m, 330, ft, were, created, for, the, extraction, of, metal, ores, borehole, drilling, and, derricks, were, used, to, lift, brine, to, iron, pans, where, it, was, distilled, into, salt, the, distillation, furnaces, were, heated, by, natural, gas, funnelled, to, the, surface, through, bamboo, pipelines, these, boreholes, perhaps, reached, a, depth, of, 600, m, 2000, ft, han, era, mechanical, engineering, comes, largely, from, the, choice, observational, writings, of, sometimes, disinterested, confucian, scholars, who, generally, considered, scientific, and, engineering, endeavours, to, be, far, beneath, them, professional, artisan, engineers, jiang, did, not, leave, behind, detailed, records, of, their, work, han, scholars, who, often, had, little, or, no, expertise, in, mechanical, engineering, sometimes, provided, insufficient, information, on, the, various, technologies, they, described, nevertheless, some, han, literary, sources, provide, crucial, information, for, example, in, 15, bc, the, philosopher, and, poet, yang, xiong, described, the, invention, of, the, belt, drive, for, a, quilling, machine, which, was, of, great, importance, to, early, textile, manufacturing, the, inventions, of, mechanical, engineer, and, craftsman, ding, huan, are, mentioned, in, the, miscellaneous, notes, on, the, western, capital, around, ad, 180, ding, created, a, manually, operated, rotary, fan, used, for, air, conditioning, within, palace, buildings, ding, also, used, gimbals, as, pivotal, supports, for, one, of, his, incense, burners, and, invented, the, world, s, first, known, zoetrope, lamp, modern, archaeology, has, led, to, the, discovery, of, han, artwork, portraying, inventions, which, were, otherwise, absent, in, han, literary, sources, as, observed, in, han, miniature, tomb, models, but, not, in, literary, sources, the, crank, handle, was, used, to, operate, the, fans, of, winnowing, machines, that, separated, grain, from, chaff, the, odometer, cart, invented, during, the, han, period, measured, journey, lengths, using, mechanical, figures, banging, drums, and, gongs, to, indicate, each, distance, travelled, this, invention, is, depicted, in, han, artwork, by, the, 2nd, century, yet, detailed, written, descriptions, were, not, offered, until, the, 3rd, century, modern, archaeologists, have, also, unearthed, specimens, of, devices, used, during, the, han, dynasty, for, example, a, pair, of, sliding, metal, calipers, used, by, craftsmen, for, making, minute, measurements, these, calipers, contain, inscriptions, of, the, exact, day, and, year, they, were, manufactured, these, tools, are, not, mentioned, in, any, han, literary, sources, the, waterwheel, appeared, in, chinese, records, during, the, han, as, mentioned, by, huan, tan, c, 20, ad, they, were, used, to, turn, gears, that, lifted, iron, trip, hammers, and, were, used, in, pounding, threshing, and, polishing, grain, however, there, is, no, sufficient, evidence, for, the, watermill, in, china, until, about, the, 5th, century, the, nanyang, commandery, administrator, mechanical, engineer, and, metallurgist, du, shi, d, 38, ad, created, a, waterwheel, powered, reciprocator, that, worked, the, bellows, for, the, smelting, of, iron, waterwheels, were, also, used, to, power, chain, pumps, that, lifted, water, to, raised, irrigation, ditches, the, chain, pump, was, first, mentioned, in, china, by, the, philosopher, wang, chong, in, his, 1st, century, lunheng, the, armillary, sphere, a, three, dimensional, representation, of, the, movements, in, the, celestial, sphere, was, invented, in, han, china, by, the, 1st, century, bc, using, a, water, clock, waterwheel, and, a, series, of, gears, the, court, astronomer, zhang, heng, 78, 139, ad, was, able, to, mechanically, rotate, his, metal, ringed, armillary, sphere, to, address, the, problem, of, slowed, timekeeping, in, the, pressure, head, of, the, inflow, water, clock, zhang, was, the, first, in, china, to, install, an, additional, tank, between, the, reservoir, and, inflow, vessel, zhang, also, invented, a, device, he, termed, an, earthquake, weathervane, houfeng, didong, yi, which, the, british, sinologist, and, historian, joseph, needham, described, as, the, ancestor, of, all, seismographs, this, device, was, able, to, detect, the, exact, cardinal, or, ordinal, direction, of, earthquakes, from, hundreds, of, kilometres, away, it, employed, an, inverted, pendulum, that, when, disturbed, by, ground, tremors, would, trigger, a, set, of, gears, that, dropped, a, metal, ball, from, one, of, eight, dragon, mouths, representing, all, eight, directions, into, a, metal, toad, s, mouth, the, account, of, this, device, in, the, book, of, the, later, han, describes, how, on, one, occasion, one, of, the, metal, balls, was, triggered, without, any, of, the, observers, feeling, a, disturbance, several, days, later, a, messenger, arrived, bearing, news, that, an, earthquake, had, struck, in, longxi, commandery, modern, gansu, the, direction, the, device, had, indicated, which, forced, the, officials, at, court, to, admit, the, efficacy, of, zhang, s, device, three, han, mathematical, treatises, still, exist, these, are, the, book, on, numbers, and, computation, the, zhoubi, suanjing, and, the, nine, chapters, on, the, mathematical, art, han, mathematical, achievements, include, solving, problems, with, right, triangles, square, roots, cube, roots, and, matrix, methods, finding, more, accurate, approximations, for, pi, providing, mathematical, proof, of, the, pythagorean, theorem, use, of, the, decimal, fraction, gaussian, elimination, to, solve, linear, equations, and, continued, fractions, to, find, the, roots, of, equations, one, of, the, han, s, greatest, mathematical, advancements, was, the, world, s, first, use, of, negative, numbers, negative, numbers, first, appeared, in, the, nine, chapters, on, the, mathematical, art, as, black, counting, rods, where, positive, numbers, were, represented, by, red, counting, rods, negative, numbers, were, also, used, by, the, greek, mathematician, diophantus, around, ad, 275, and, in, the, 7th, century, bakhshali, manuscript, of, gandhara, south, asia, but, were, not, widely, accepted, in, europe, until, the, 16th, century, the, han, applied, mathematics, to, various, diverse, disciplines, in, musical, tuning, jing, fang, 78, 37, bc, realized, that, 53, perfect, fifths, was, approximate, to, 31, octaves, he, also, created, a, musical, scale, of, 60, tones, calculating, the, difference, at, 177147, 176776, the, same, value, of, 53, equal, temperament, discovered, by,
