on, 26, december, 2004, at, 07, 58, 53, local, time, utc, 7, a, major, earthquake, with, a, magnitude, of, 9, 2, 9, 3, m, w, struck, with, an, epicentre, off, the, west, coast, of, northern, sumatra, indonesia, the, undersea, megathrust, earthquake, known, by, the, scientific, community, as, the, sumatra, andaman, earthquake, was, caused, by, a, rupture, along, the, fault, between, the, burma, plate, and, the, indian, plate, and, reached, a, mercalli, intensity, up, to, ix, in, some, areas, a, massive, tsunami, with, waves, up, to, 30, m, 100, ft, high, known, as, the, boxing, day, tsunami, after, the, boxing, day, holiday, or, as, the, asian, tsunami, devastated, communities, along, the, surrounding, coasts, of, the, indian, ocean, killing, an, estimated, 227, 898, people, in, 14, countries, in, one, of, the, deadliest, natural, disasters, in, recorded, history, the, direct, results, caused, major, disruptions, to, living, conditions, and, commerce, in, coastal, provinces, of, surrounded, countries, including, aceh, indonesia, sri, lanka, tamil, nadu, india, and, khao, lak, thailand, banda, aceh, reported, the, largest, number, of, deaths, it, is, the, deadliest, natural, disaster, of, the, 21st, century, and, the, worst, tsunami, disaster, in, history, it, is, also, the, worst, natural, disaster, in, the, history, of, indonesia, sri, lanka, and, thailand, it, was, the, most, powerful, earthquake, ever, recorded, in, asia, the, most, powerful, earthquake, in, the, 21st, century, and, at, least, the, third, most, powerful, earthquake, ever, recorded, in, the, world, since, modern, seismography, began, in, 1900, it, had, the, longest, fault, rupture, ever, observed, between, 1, 200, km, to, 1, 300, km, 720, mi, to, 780, mi, and, had, the, longest, duration, of, faulting, ever, observed, at, least, ten, minutes, it, caused, the, planet, to, vibrate, as, much, as, 10, mm, 0, 4, in, and, also, remotely, triggered, earthquakes, as, far, away, as, alaska, its, epicentre, was, between, simeulue, and, mainland, sumatra, the, plight, of, the, affected, people, and, countries, prompted, a, worldwide, humanitarian, response, with, donations, totalling, more, than, us, 14, billion, equivalent, to, us, 23, billion, in, 2023, currency, the, 2004, indian, ocean, earthquake, was, initially, documented, as, having, a, moment, magnitude, of, 8, 8, the, united, states, geological, survey, has, its, estimate, of, 9, 1, hiroo, kanamori, of, the, california, institute, of, technology, estimates, that, m, w, 9, 2, is, best, representative, of, the, earthquake, s, size, however, more, recent, studies, estimate, the, magnitude, to, be, m, w, 9, 3, a, 2016, study, estimated, the, magnitude, to, be, m, w, 9, 25, while, a, 2021, study, revised, its, 2007, estimate, of, m, w, 9, 1, to, a, new, magnitude, of, m, w, 9, 2, the, hypocentre, of, the, main, earthquake, was, approximately, 160, km, 100, mi, off, the, western, coast, of, northern, sumatra, in, the, indian, ocean, just, north, of, simeulue, island, at, a, depth, of, 30, km, 19, mi, below, mean, sea, level, initially, reported, as, 10, km, or, 6, 2, mi, the, northern, section, of, the, sunda, megathrust, ruptured, over, a, length, of, 1, 300, km, 810, mi, the, earthquake, followed, by, the, tsunami, was, felt, in, bangladesh, india, malaysia, myanmar, thailand, sri, lanka, and, the, maldives, splay, faults, or, secondary, pop, up, faults, caused, long, narrow, parts, of, the, seafloor, to, pop, up, in, seconds, this, quickly, elevated, the, height, and, increased, the, speed, of, waves, destroying, the, nearby, indonesian, town, of, lhoknga, indonesia, lies, between, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, along, the, north, eastern, islands, adjacent, to, new, guinea, and, the, alpide, belt, that, runs, along, the, south, and, west, from, sumatra, java, bali, flores, to, timor, the, 2002, sumatra, earthquake, is, believed, to, have, been, a, foreshock, preceding, the, main, event, by, over, two, years, great, earthquakes, such, as, the, 2004, indian, ocean, earthquake, are, associated, with, megathrust, events, in, subduction, zones, their, seismic, moments, can, account, for, a, significant, fraction, of, the, global, seismic, moment, across, century, scale, periods, of, all, the, moment, released, by, earthquakes, in, the, 100, years, from, 1906, through, 2005, roughly, one, eighth, was, due, to, the, 2004, indian, ocean, earthquake, this, quake, together, with, the, great, alaskan, earthquake, 1964, and, the, great, chilean, earthquake, 1960, account, for, almost, half, of, the, total, moment, since, 1900, the, only, earthquakes, recorded, with, a, greater, magnitude, were, the, 1960, valdivia, earthquake, magnitude, 9, 5, and, the, 1964, alaska, earthquake, in, prince, william, sound, magnitude, 9, 2, the, only, other, recorded, earthquakes, of, magnitude, 9, 0, or, greater, were, off, kamchatka, russia, on, 5, november, 1952, magnitude, 9, 0, and, t, hoku, japan, magnitude, 9, 1, in, march, 2011, each, of, these, megathrust, earthquakes, also, spawned, tsunamis, in, the, pacific, ocean, in, comparison, to, the, 2004, indian, ocean, earthquake, the, death, toll, from, these, earthquakes, and, tsunamis, was, significantly, lower, primarily, because, of, the, lower, population, density, along, the, coasts, near, affected, areas, comparisons, with, earlier, earthquakes, are, difficult, as, earthquake, strength, was, not, measured, systematically, until, the, 1930s, however, historical, earthquake, strength, can, sometimes, be, estimated, by, examining, historical, descriptions, of, the, damage, caused, and, the, geological, records, of, the, areas, where, they, occurred, some, examples, of, significant, historical, megathrust, earthquakes, are, the, 1868, arica, earthquake, in, peru, and, the, 1700, cascadia, earthquake, in, western, north, america, the, 2004, indian, ocean, earthquake, was, unusually, large, in, geographical, and, geological, extent, an, estimated, 1, 600, km, 1, 000, mi, of, fault, surface, slipped, or, ruptured, about, 15, m, 50, ft, along, the, subduction, zone, where, the, indian, plate, slides, under, or, subducts, the, overriding, burma, plate, the, slip, did, not, happen, instantaneously, but, took, place, in, two, phases, over, several, minutes, seismographic, and, acoustic, data, indicate, that, the, first, phase, involved, a, rupture, about, 400, km, 250, mi, long, and, 100, km, 60, mi, wide, 30, km, 19, mi, beneath, the, sea, bed, the, largest, rupture, ever, known, to, have, been, caused, by, an, earthquake, the, rupture, proceeded, at, about, 2, 8, km, s, 1, 74, mi, s, 10, 100, km, h, 6, 260, mph, beginning, off, the, coast, of, aceh, and, proceeding, north, westerly, over, about, 100, seconds, after, a, pause, of, about, another, 100, seconds, the, rupture, continued, northwards, towards, the, andaman, and, nicobar, islands, the, northern, rupture, occurred, more, slowly, than, in, the, south, at, about, 2, 1, km, s, 1, 3, mi, s, 7, 600, km, h, 4, 700, mph, continuing, north, for, another, five, minutes, to, a, plate, boundary, where, the, fault, type, changes, from, subduction, to, strike, slip, the, two, plates, slide, past, one, another, in, opposite, directions, the, indian, plate, is, part, of, the, indo, australian, plate, which, underlies, the, indian, ocean, and, bay, of, bengal, and, is, moving, north, east, at, an, average, of, 60, mm, a, 0, 075, in, ms, the, india, plate, meets, the, burma, plate, which, is, considered, a, portion, of, the, great, eurasian, plate, at, the, sunda, trench, at, this, point, the, india, plate, subducts, beneath, the, burma, plate, which, carries, the, nicobar, islands, the, andaman, islands, and, northern, sumatra, the, india, plate, sinks, deeper, and, deeper, beneath, the, burma, plate, until, the, increasing, temperature, and, pressure, drive, volatiles, out, of, the, subducting, plate, these, volatiles, rise, into, the, overlying, plate, causing, partial, melting, and, the, formation, of, magma, the, rising, magma, intrudes, into, the, crust, above, and, exits, the, earth, s, crust, through, volcanoes, in, the, form, of, a, volcanic, arc, the, volcanic, activity, that, results, as, the, indo, australian, plate, subducts, the, eurasian, plate, has, created, the, sunda, arc, as, well, as, the, sideways, movement, between, the, plates, the, 2004, indian, ocean, earthquake, resulted, in, a, rise, of, the, seafloor, by, several, metres, displacing, an, estimated, 30, km, 3, 7, 2, cu, mi, of, water, and, triggering, devastating, tsunami, waves, the, waves, radiated, outwards, along, the, entire, 1, 600, km, 1, 000, mi, length, of, the, rupture, acting, as, a, line, source, this, greatly, increased, the, geographical, area, over, which, the, waves, were, observed, reaching, as, far, as, mexico, chile, and, the, arctic, the, raising, of, the, seafloor, significantly, reduced, the, capacity, of, the, indian, ocean, producing, a, permanent, rise, in, the, global, sea, level, by, an, estimated, 0, 1, mm, 0, 004, in, numerous, aftershocks, were, reported, off, the, andaman, islands, the, nicobar, islands, and, the, region, of, the, original, epicentre, in, the, hours, and, days, that, followed, the, magnitude, 8, 6, 2005, nias, simeulue, earthquake, which, originated, off, the, coast, of, the, sumatran, island, of, nias, is, not, considered, an, aftershock, despite, its, proximity, to, the, epicentre, and, was, most, likely, triggered, by, stress, changes, associated, with, the, 2004, event, the, earthquake, produced, its, own, aftershocks, some, registering, a, magnitude, of, as, high, as, 6, 9, and, presently, ranks, as, the, third, largest, earthquake, ever, recorded, on, the, moment, magnitude, or, richter, magnitude, scale, other, aftershocks, of, up, to, magnitude, 7, 2, continued, to, shake, the, region, daily, for, three, or, four, months, as, well, as, continuing, aftershocks, the, energy, released, by, the, original, earthquake, continued, to, make, its, presence, felt, well, after, the, event, a, week, after, the, earthquake, its, reverberations, could, still, be, measured, providing, valuable, scientific, data, about, the, earth, s, interior, the, 2004, indian, ocean, earthquake, came, just, three, days, after, a, magnitude, 8, 1, earthquake, in, the, sub, antarctic, auckland, islands, an, uninhabited, region, west, of, new, zealand, and, macquarie, island, to, australia, s, north, this, is, unusual, since, earthquakes, of, magnitude, eight, or, more, occur, only, about, once, per, year, on, average, the, u, s, geological, survey, sees, no, evidence, of, a, causal, relationship, between, these, events, the, 2004, indian, ocean, earthquake, is, thought, to, have, triggered, activity, in, both, leuser, mountain, and, mount, talang, volcanoes, in, aceh, along, the, same, range, of, peaks, while, the, 2005, nias, simeulue, earthquake, sparked, activity, in, lake, toba, a, massive, caldera, in, sumatra, the, energy, released, on, the, earth, s, surface, m, e, the, energy, magnitude, which, is, the, seismic, potential, for, damage, by, the, 2004, indian, ocean, earthquake, was, estimated, at, 1, 1, 10, 17, joules, the, earthquake, generated, a, seismic, oscillation, of, the, earth, s, surface, of, up, to, 200, 300, mm, 8, 12, in, equivalent, to, the, effect, of, the, tidal, forces, caused, by, the, sun, and, moon, the, seismic, waves, of, the, earthquake, were, felt, across, the, planet, as, far, away, as, the, u, s, state, of, oklahoma, where, vertical, movements, of, 3, mm, 0, 12, in, were, recorded, by, february, 2005, the, earthquake, s, effects, were, still, detectable, as, a, 20, m, 0, 02, mm, 0, 0008, in, complex, harmonic, oscillation, of, the, earth, s, surface, which, gradually, diminished, and, merged, with, the, incessant, free, oscillation, of, the, earth, more, than, four, months, after, the, earthquake, because, of, its, enormous, energy, release, and, shallow, rupture, depth, the, earthquake, generated, remarkable, seismic, ground, motions, around, the, globe, particularly, due, to, huge, rayleigh, surface, elastic, waves, that, exceeded, 10, mm, 0, 4, in, in, vertical, amplitude, everywhere, on, earth, the, record, section, plot, displays, vertical, displacements, of, the, earth, s, surface, recorded, by, seismometers, from, the, iris, usgs, global, seismographic, network, plotted, with, respect, to, time, since, the, earthquake, initiation, on, the, horizontal, axis, and, vertical, displacements, of, the, earth, on, the, vertical, axis, note, the, 1, cm, scale, bar, at, the, bottom, for, scale, the, seismograms, are, arranged, vertically, by, distance, from, the, epicentre, in, degrees, the, earliest, lower, amplitude, signal, is, that, of, the, compressional, p, wave, which, takes, about, 22, minutes, to, reach, the, other, side, of, the, planet, the, antipode, in, this, case, near, ecuador, the, largest, amplitude, signals, are, seismic, surface, waves, that, reach, the, antipode, after, about, 100, minutes, the, surface, waves, can, be, clearly, seen, to, reinforce, near, the, antipode, with, the, closest, seismic, stations, in, ecuador, and, to, subsequently, encircle, the, planet, to, return, to, the, epicentral, region, after, about, 200, minutes, a, major, aftershock, magnitude, 7, 1, can, be, seen, at, the, closest, stations, starting, just, after, the, 200, minute, mark, the, aftershock, would, be, considered, a, major, earthquake, under, ordinary, circumstances, but, is, dwarfed, by, the, mainshock, the, shift, of, mass, and, the, massive, release, of, energy, slightly, altered, the, earth, s, rotation, weeks, after, the, earthquake, theoretical, models, suggested, the, earthquake, shortened, the, length, of, a, day, by, 2, 68, microseconds, due, to, a, decrease, in, the, oblateness, of, the, earth, it, also, caused, the, earth, to, minutely, wobble, on, its, axis, by, up, to, 25, mm, 1, in, in, the, direction, of, 145, east, longitude, or, perhaps, by, up, to, 50, or, 60, mm, 2, 0, or, 2, 4, in, because, of, tidal, effects, of, the, moon, the, length, of, a, day, increases, at, an, average, of, 15, microseconds, per, year, so, any, rotational, change, due, to, the, earthquake, will, be, lost, quickly, similarly, the, natural, chandler, wobble, of, the, earth, which, in, some, cases, can, be, up, to, 15, m, 50, ft, eventually, offset, the, minor, wobble, produced, by, the, earthquake, there, was, 10, m, 33, ft, movement, laterally, and, 4, 5, m, 13, 16, ft, vertically, along, the, fault, line, early, speculation, was, that, some, of, the, smaller, islands, south, west, of, sumatra, which, is, on, the, burma, plate, the, southern, regions, are, on, the, sunda, plate, might, have, moved, south, west, by, up, to, 36, m, 120, ft, but, more, accurate, data, released, more, than, a, month, after, the, earthquake, found, the, movement, to, be, about, 0, 2, m, 8, in, since, movement, was, vertical, as, well, as, lateral, some, coastal, areas, may, have, been, moved, to, below, sea, level, the, andaman, and, nicobar, islands, appear, to, have, shifted, south, west, by, around, 1, 25, m, 4, ft, 1, in, and, to, have, sunk, by, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, in, february, 2005, the, royal, navy, vessel, hms, scott, surveyed, the, seabed, around, the, earthquake, zone, which, varies, in, depth, between, 1, 000, and, 5, 000, m, 550, and, 2, 730, fathoms, 3, 300, and, 16, 400, ft, the, survey, conducted, using, a, high, resolution, multi, beam, sonar, system, revealed, that, the, earthquake, had, made, a, considerable, impact, on, the, topography, of, the, seabed, 1, 500, metre, high, 5, 000, ft, thrust, ridges, created, by, previous, geologic, activity, along, the, fault, had, collapsed, generating, landslides, several, kilometres, wide, one, such, landslide, consisted, of, a, single, block, of, rock, some, 100, m, 330, ft, high, and, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, long, the, momentum, of, the, water, displaced, by, tectonic, uplift, had, also, dragged, massive, slabs, of, rock, each, weighing, millions, of, tonnes, as, far, as, 10, km, 6, mi, across, the, seabed, an, oceanic, trench, several, kilometres, wide, was, exposed, in, the, earthquake, zone, the, topex, poseidon, and, jason, 1, satellites, happened, to, pass, over, the, tsunami, as, it, was, crossing, the, ocean, these, satellites, carry, radars, that, measure, precisely, the, height, of, the, water, surface, anomalies, in, the, order, of, 500, mm, 20, in, were, measured, measurements, from, these, satellites, may, prove, invaluable, for, the, understanding, of, the, earthquake, and, tsunami, unlike, data, from, tide, gauges, installed, on, shores, measurements, obtained, in, the, middle, of, the, ocean, can, be, used, for, computing, the, parameters, of, the, source, earthquake, without, having, to, compensate, for, the, complex, ways, in, which, proximity, to, the, coast, changes, the, size, and, shape, of, a, wave, before, the, 2004, quake, there, were, three, arguments, against, a, large, earthquake, occurring, in, the, sumatra, region, after, the, quake, it, was, considered, that, earthquake, hazard, risk, would, need, to, be, reassessed, for, regions, previously, thought, to, have, low, risk, based, on, these, criteria, the, sudden, vertical, rise, of, the, seabed, by, several, metres, during, the, earthquake, displaced, massive, volumes, of, water, resulting, in, a, tsunami, that, struck, the, coasts, of, the, indian, ocean, a, tsunami, that, causes, damage, far, away, from, its, source, is, sometimes, called, a, teletsunami, and, is, much, more, likely, to, be, produced, by, the, vertical, motion, of, the, seabed, than, by, horizontal, motion, the, tsunami, like, all, the, others, behaved, differently, in, deep, water, than, in, shallow, water, in, deep, ocean, water, tsunami, waves, form, only, a, low, broad, hump, barely, noticeable, and, harmless, which, generally, travels, at, the, high, speed, of, 500, to, 1, 000, km, h, 310, to, 620, mph, in, shallow, water, near, coastlines, a, tsunami, slows, down, to, only, tens, of, kilometres, per, hour, but, in, doing, so, forms, large, destructive, waves, scientists, investigating, the, damage, in, aceh, found, evidence, that, the, wave, reached, a, height, of, 24, m, 80, ft, when, coming, ashore, along, large, stretches, of, the, coastline, rising, to, 30, m, 100, ft, in, some, areas, when, travelling, inland, radar, satellites, recorded, the, heights, of, tsunami, waves, in, deep, water, the, maximum, height, was, at, 600, mm, 2, ft, two, hours, after, the, earthquake, the, first, such, observations, ever, made, according, to, tad, murty, vice, president, of, the, tsunami, society, the, total, energy, of, the, tsunami, waves, was, equivalent, to, about, 5, megatons, of, tnt, 21, pj, which, is, more, than, twice, the, total, explosive, energy, used, during, all, of, world, war, ii, including, the, two, atomic, bombs, but, still, a, couple, of, orders, of, magnitude, less, than, the, energy, released, in, the, earthquake, itself, in, many, places, the, waves, reached, as, far, as, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, inland, because, the, 1, 600, km, 1, 000, mi, fault, affected, by, the, earthquake, was, in, a, nearly, north, south, orientation, the, greatest, strength, of, the, tsunami, waves, was, in, an, east, west, direction, bangladesh, which, lies, at, the, northern, end, of, the, bay, of, bengal, had, few, casualties, despite, being, a, low, lying, country, relatively, near, the, epicentre, it, also, benefited, from, the, fact, that, the, earthquake, proceeded, more, slowly, in, the, northern, rupture, zone, greatly, reducing, the, energy, of, the, water, displacements, in, that, region, coasts, that, have, a, landmass, between, them, and, the, tsunami, s, location, of, origin, are, usually, safe, however, tsunami, waves, can, sometimes, diffract, around, such, landmasses, thus, the, state, of, kerala, was, hit, by, the, tsunami, despite, being, on, the, western, coast, of, india, and, the, western, coast, of, sri, lanka, suffered, substantial, impacts, distance, alone, was, no, guarantee, of, safety, as, somalia, was, hit, harder, than, bangladesh, despite, being, much, farther, away, because, of, the, distances, involved, the, tsunami, took, anywhere, from, fifteen, minutes, to, seven, hours, to, reach, the, coastlines, the, northern, regions, of, the, indonesian, island, of, sumatra, were, hit, quickly, while, sri, lanka, and, the, east, coast, of, india, were, hit, roughly, 90, minutes, to, two, hours, later, thailand, was, struck, about, two, hours, later, despite, being, closer, to, the, epicentre, because, the, tsunami, travelled, more, slowly, in, the, shallow, andaman, sea, off, its, western, coast, the, tsunami, was, noticed, as, far, as, struisbaai, in, south, africa, about, 8, 500, km, 5, 300, mi, away, where, a, 1, 5, metre, high, 5, ft, tide, surged, on, shore, about, 16, hours, after, the, earthquake, it, took, a, relatively, long, time, to, reach, struisbaai, at, the, southernmost, point, of, africa, probably, because, of, the, broad, continental, shelf, off, south, africa, and, because, the, tsunami, would, have, followed, the, south, african, coast, from, east, to, west, the, tsunami, also, reached, antarctica, where, tidal, gauges, at, japan, s, showa, base, recorded, oscillations, of, up, to, a, metre, 3, ft, 3, in, with, disturbances, lasting, a, couple, of, days, some, of, the, tsunami, s, energy, escaped, into, the, pacific, ocean, where, it, produced, small, but, measurable, tsunamis, along, the, western, coasts, of, north, and, south, america, typically, around, 200, to, 400, mm, 7, 9, to, 15, 7, in, at, manzanillo, mexico, a, 2, 6, m, 8, 5, ft, crest, to, trough, tsunami, was, measured, as, well, the, tsunami, was, large, enough, to, be, detected, in, vancouver, which, puzzled, many, scientists, as, the, tsunamis, measured, in, some, parts, of, south, america, were, larger, than, those, measured, in, some, parts, of, the, indian, ocean, it, has, been, theorized, that, the, tsunamis, were, focused, and, directed, at, long, ranges, by, the, mid, ocean, ridges, which, run, along, the, margins, of, the, continental, plates, despite, a, delay, of, up, to, several, hours, between, the, earthquake, and, the, impact, of, the, tsunami, nearly, all, of, the, victims, were, taken, by, surprise, there, were, no, tsunami, warning, systems, in, the, indian, ocean, to, detect, tsunamis, or, to, warn, the, general, population, living, around, the, ocean, tsunami, detection, is, difficult, because, while, a, tsunami, is, in, deep, water, it, has, little, height, and, a, network, of, sensors, is, needed, to, detect, it, tsunamis, are, more, frequent, in, the, pacific, ocean, than, in, other, oceans, because, of, earthquakes, in, the, ring, of, fire, although, the, extreme, western, edge, of, the, ring, of, fire, extends, into, the, indian, ocean, the, point, where, the, earthquake, struck, no, warning, system, exists, in, that, ocean, tsunamis, there, are, relatively, rare, despite, earthquakes, being, relatively, frequent, in, indonesia, the, last, major, tsunami, was, caused, by, the, 1883, eruption, of, krakatoa, not, every, earthquake, produces, large, tsunamis, on, 28, march, 2005, a, magnitude, 8, 7, earthquake, hit, roughly, the, same, area, of, the, indian, ocean, but, did, not, result, in, a, major, tsunami, the, first, warning, sign, of, a, possible, tsunami, is, the, earthquake, itself, however, tsunamis, can, strike, thousands, of, kilometres, away, where, the, earthquake, is, felt, only, weakly, or, not, at, all, also, in, the, minutes, preceding, a, tsunami, strike, the, sea, sometimes, recedes, temporarily, from, the, coast, which, was, observed, on, the, eastern, earthquake, rupture, zone, such, as, the, coastlines, of, aceh, phuket, island, and, khao, lak, area, in, thailand, penang, island, of, malaysia, and, the, andaman, and, nicobar, islands, this, rare, sight, reportedly, induced, people, especially, children, to, visit, the, coast, to,

cove, and, marina, park, aberdeen, jetty, areas, along, the, west, coast, the, inundation, was, observed, around, guptapara, manjeri, wandoor, collinpur, and, tirur, regions, several, near, shore, establishments, and, numerous, infrastructures, such, as, seawalls, and, a, 20, mw, diesel, generated, power, plant, at, bamboo, flat, were, destroyed, at, port, blair, the, water, receded, before, the, first, wave, and, the, third, wave, was, the, tallest, and, caused, the, most, damage, results, of, the, tsunami, survey, in, south, andaman, along, chiriyatapu, corbyn, s, cove, and, wandoor, beaches, meanwhile, in, the, little, andaman, tsunami, waves, impinged, on, the, eastern, shore, about, 25, to, 30, minutes, after, the, earthquake, in, a, four, wave, cycle, of, which, the, fourth, tsunami, was, the, most, devastating, with, a, wave, height, of, about, 10, m, 33, ft, the, tsunami, destroyed, settlements, at, hut, bay, within, a, range, of, 1, km, 0, 62, mi, from, the, seashore, run, up, level, up, to, 3, 8, m, 12, ft, have, been, measured, in, malacca, located, on, the, island, of, car, nicobar, there, were, three, tsunami, waves, the, sea, was, observed, to, rise, suddenly, before, the, onset, of, the, first, wave, the, first, wave, came, 5, minutes, after, the, earthquake, preceded, by, a, recession, of, the, sea, up, to, 600, 700, m, 2, 000, 2, 300, ft, the, second, and, third, waves, came, in, 10, minutes, intervals, after, the, first, wave, the, third, wave, was, the, strongest, with, a, maximum, tsunami, wave, height, of, 11, m, 36, ft, waves, nearly, three, stories, high, devastated, the, indian, air, force, base, located, just, south, of, malacca, the, maximum, tsunami, wave, height, of, 11, m, 36, ft, inundation, limit, was, found, to, be, up, to, 1, 25, km, 0, 78, mi, inland, the, impact, of, the, waves, was, so, severe, that, four, oil, tankers, were, thrown, almost, 800, m, 2, 600, ft, from, the, seashore, near, malacca, to, the, air, force, colony, main, gate, in, chuckchucha, and, lapati, the, tsunami, arrived, in, a, three, wave, cycle, with, a, maximum, tsunami, wave, height, of, 12, m, 39, ft, in, campbell, bay, of, great, nicobar, island, the, tsunami, waves, hit, the, area, three, times, with, an, inundation, limit, of, 250, 500, m, 820, 1, 640, ft, a, rise, in, sea, level, was, observed, before, the, first, wave, came, within, 5, minutes, of, the, earthquake, the, second, and, third, waves, came, in, 10, minute, intervals, after, the, first, the, second, wave, was, the, strongest, the, tsunami, waves, wreaked, havoc, in, the, densely, populated, jogindar, nagar, area, situated, 13, km, 8, 1, mi, south, of, campbell, bay, according, to, local, accounts, tsunami, waves, attacked, the, area, three, times, the, first, wave, came, five, minutes, after, the, mainshock, 0629, hrs, with, a, marginal, drop, in, sea, level, the, second, wave, came, 10, minutes, after, the, first, one, with, a, maximum, height, of, 4, 8, m, 16, ft, to, 8, m, 26, ft, and, caused, the, major, destruction, the, third, wave, came, within, 15, minutes, after, the, second, with, lower, wave, height, the, maximum, inundation, limit, due, to, tsunami, water, was, about, 500, m, 1, 600, ft, the, worst, affected, island, in, the, andaman, nicobar, chain, is, katchall, island, with, 303, people, confirmed, dead, and, 4, 354, missing, out, of, a, total, population, of, 5, 312, the, significant, shielding, of, port, blair, and, campbell, bay, by, steep, mountainous, outcrops, contributed, to, the, relatively, low, wave, heights, at, these, locations, whereas, the, open, terrain, along, the, eastern, coast, at, malacca, and, hut, bay, contributed, to, the, great, height, of, the, tsunami, waves, reports, of, tsunami, wave, height, the, tsunami, severely, affected, the, maldives, at, a, distance, of, 2, 500, km, 1, 600, mi, from, the, epicentre, similar, to, sri, lanka, survivors, reported, three, waves, with, the, second, wave, being, the, most, powerful, being, rich, in, coral, reefs, the, maldives, provides, an, opportunity, for, scientists, to, assess, the, impact, of, a, tsunami, on, coral, atolls, the, significantly, lower, tsunami, impact, on, the, maldives, compared, to, sri, lanka, is, mostly, due, to, the, topography, and, bathymetry, of, the, atoll, chain, with, offshore, coral, reefs, deep, channels, separating, individual, atolls, and, its, arrival, within, low, tide, which, decreased, the, power, of, the, tsunami, after, the, tsunami, there, was, some, concern, that, the, country, might, be, submerged, entirely, and, become, uninhabitable, however, this, was, proven, untrue, the, highest, tsunami, wave, measured, was, 4, m, 13, ft, at, vilufushi, island, the, tsunami, arrived, approximately, 2, hours, after, the, earthquake, the, greatest, tsunami, inundation, occurred, at, north, male, atoll, male, island, at, 250, m, 820, ft, along, the, streets, local, footage, recorded, showed, the, tsunami, flooding, the, streets, up, to, knee, level, in, town, while, another, video, taken, at, the, beach, showed, the, tsunami, slowly, flooding, and, gradually, surging, inland, the, maldives, tsunami, wave, analysis, in, myanmar, the, tsunami, caused, only, moderate, damage, which, arrived, between, 2, and, 5, 5, hours, after, the, earthquake, although, the, country, s, western, andaman, sea, coastline, lies, at, the, proximity, of, the, rupture, zone, there, were, smaller, tsunamis, than, the, neighbouring, thai, coast, because, the, main, tsunami, source, did, not, extend, to, the, andaman, islands, another, factor, is, that, some, coasts, of, taninthayi, division, were, protected, by, the, myeik, archipelago, based, on, scientific, surveys, from, ayeyarwady, delta, through, taninthayi, division, it, was, revealed, that, tsunami, heights, along, the, myanmar, coast, were, between, 0, 4, 2, 9, m, 1, ft, 4, in, 9, ft, 6, in, eyewitnesses, compared, the, tsunami, with, the, rainy, season, high, tide, although, at, most, locations, the, tsunami, height, was, similar, or, smaller, than, the, rainy, season, high, tide, level, tsunami, survey, heights, interviews, with, local, people, indicate, that, they, did, not, feel, the, earthquake, in, taninthayi, division, or, ayeyarwady, delta, the, 71, casualties, can, be, attributed, to, poor, housing, infrastructure, and, additionally, the, fact, that, the, coastal, residents, in, the, surveyed, areas, live, on, flat, land, along, the, coast, especially, in, the, ayeyarwady, delta, and, that, there, is, no, higher, ground, to, which, to, evacuate, the, tsunami, heights, from, the, 2004, december, earthquake, were, not, more, than, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, along, the, myanmar, coast, the, amplitudes, were, slightly, large, off, the, ayeyarwady, delta, probably, because, the, shallow, delta, caused, a, concentration, in, tsunami, energy, the, tsunami, travelled, 5, 000, km, 3, 100, mi, west, across, the, open, ocean, before, striking, the, east, african, country, of, somalia, around, 289, fatalities, were, reported, in, the, horn, of, africa, drowned, by, four, tsunami, waves, the, hardest, hit, was, a, 650, km, 400, mi, stretch, of, the, somalia, coastline, between, garacad, mudug, region, and, xaafuun, bari, region, which, forms, part, of, the, puntland, province, most, of, the, victims, were, reported, along, the, low, lying, xaafuun, peninsula, the, puntland, coast, in, northern, somalia, was, by, far, the, area, hardest, hit, by, the, waves, to, the, west, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, waves, arrived, around, noon, local, time, consequently, tsunami, runup, heights, vary, from, 5, m, 16, ft, to, 9, m, 30, ft, with, inundation, distances, varying, from, 44, m, 144, ft, to, 704, m, 2, 310, ft, the, maximum, runup, height, of, almost, 9, m, 30, ft, was, recorded, in, bandarbeyla, an, even, higher, runup, point, was, measured, on, a, cliff, near, the, town, of, eyl, solely, on, an, eyewitness, account, the, highest, death, toll, was, in, hafun, with, 19, dead, and, 160, people, presumed, missing, out, of, its, 5, 000, inhabitants, this, was, the, highest, number, of, casualties, in, a, single, african, town, and, the, largest, tsunami, death, toll, in, a, single, town, to, the, west, of, the, indian, subcontinent, in, xaafuun, small, drawbacks, were, observed, before, the, third, and, most, powerful, tsunami, wave, flooded, the, town, the, tsunami, also, reached, malaysia, mainly, on, the, northern, states, such, as, kedah, perak, and, penang, and, on, offshore, islands, such, as, langkawi, island, peninsular, malaysia, was, shielded, by, the, full, force, of, the, tsunami, due, to, the, protection, offered, by, the, island, of, sumatra, which, lies, just, off, the, western, coast, bangladesh, escaped, major, damage, and, deaths, because, the, water, displaced, by, the, strike, slip, fault, was, relatively, little, on, the, northern, section, of, the, rupture, zone, which, ruptured, slowly, in, yemen, the, tsunami, killed, two, people, with, a, maximum, runup, of, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, the, tsunami, was, detected, in, the, southern, parts, of, east, africa, where, rough, seas, were, reported, specifically, on, the, eastern, and, southern, coasts, that, face, the, indian, ocean, a, few, other, african, countries, also, recorded, fatalities, one, in, kenya, three, in, seychelles, ten, in, tanzania, and, south, africa, where, two, were, killed, as, a, direct, result, of, the, tsunami, the, furthest, from, the, epicentre, tidal, surges, also, occurred, along, the, western, australian, coast, that, lasted, for, several, hours, resulting, in, boats, losing, their, moorings, and, two, people, needing, to, be, rescued, according, to, the, final, report, of, the, tsunami, evaluation, coalition, a, total, of, 227, 898, people, died, another, common, total, as, given, by, the, un, office, of, the, special, envoy, for, tsunami, recovery, is, 229, 866, dead, measured, in, lives, lost, this, is, one, of, the, ten, worst, earthquakes, in, recorded, history, as, well, as, the, single, worst, tsunami, in, history, indonesia, was, the, worst, affected, area, with, most, death, toll, estimates, at, around, 170, 000, the, death, toll, for, indonesia, alone, may, be, as, high, as, 172, 761, lives, an, initial, report, by, siti, fadilah, supari, the, indonesian, minister, of, health, at, the, time, estimated, the, death, total, to, be, as, high, as, 220, 000, in, indonesia, alone, giving, a, total, of, 280, 000, fatalities, however, the, estimated, number, of, dead, and, missing, in, indonesia, were, later, reduced, by, over, 50, 000, in, their, report, the, tsunami, evaluation, coalition, stated, it, should, be, remembered, that, all, such, data, are, subject, to, error, as, data, on, missing, persons, especially, are, not, always, as, good, as, one, might, wish, a, much, higher, number, of, deaths, has, been, suggested, for, myanmar, based, on, reports, from, thailand, the, tsunami, caused, severe, damage, and, deaths, as, far, as, the, east, coast, of, africa, with, the, furthest, recorded, fatality, directly, attributed, to, the, tsunami, at, rooi, els, close, to, cape, town, 8, 000, km, 5, 000, mi, from, the, epicentre, relief, agencies, reported, that, one, third, of, the, dead, appeared, to, be, children, this, was, a, result, of, the, high, proportion, of, children, in, the, populations, of, many, of, the, affected, regions, and, because, children, were, the, least, able, to, resist, being, overcome, by, the, surging, waters, oxfam, went, on, to, report, that, as, many, as, four, times, more, women, than, men, were, killed, in, some, regions, because, they, were, waiting, on, the, beach, for, the, fishers, to, return, and, looking, after, their, children, in, the, houses, states, of, emergency, were, declared, in, sri, lanka, indonesia, and, the, maldives, the, united, nations, estimated, at, the, outset, that, the, relief, operation, would, be, the, costliest, in, human, history, then, un, secretary, general, kofi, annan, stated, that, reconstruction, would, probably, take, between, five, and, ten, years, governments, and, non, governmental, organizations, feared, that, the, final, death, toll, might, double, as, a, result, of, diseases, prompting, a, massive, humanitarian, response, in, addition, to, a, large, number, of, local, residents, up, to, 9, 000, foreign, tourists, mostly, europeans, enjoying, the, peak, holiday, travel, season, were, among, the, dead, or, missing, especially, people, from, the, nordic, countries, sweden, was, the, european, country, most, severely, affected, both, in, absolute, numbers, and, by, a, wide, margin, when, considered, in, relation, to, the, country, s, population, with, a, death, toll, of, 543, germany, was, close, behind, with, 539, identified, victims, beyond, the, heavy, toll, on, human, lives, the, indian, ocean, earthquake, caused, an, enormous, environmental, impact, that, affected, the, region, for, many, years, severe, damage, was, inflicted, on, ecosystems, such, as, mangroves, coral, reefs, forests, coastal, wetlands, vegetation, sand, dunes, and, rock, formations, animal, and, plant, biodiversity, and, groundwater, also, the, spread, of, solid, and, liquid, waste, and, industrial, chemicals, water, pollution, and, the, destruction, of, sewage, collectors, and, treatment, plants, threatened, the, environment, even, further, the, environmental, impact, took, a, long, time, and, significant, resources, to, assess, the, main, effect, was, caused, by, poisoning, of, the, freshwater, supplies, and, of, the, soil, by, saltwater, infiltration, and, a, deposit, of, a, salt, layer, over, arable, land, in, the, maldives, 16, to, 17, coral, reef, atolls, that, were, overcome, by, sea, waves, are, without, fresh, water, and, could, be, rendered, uninhabitable, for, decades, uncountable, wells, that, served, communities, were, invaded, by, sea, sand, and, earth, and, aquifers, were, invaded, through, porous, rock, on, the, island, s, east, coast, the, tsunami, contaminated, wells, on, which, many, villagers, relied, for, drinking, water, the, colombo, based, international, water, management, institute, monitored, the, effects, of, saltwater, and, concluded, that, the, wells, recovered, to, pre, tsunami, drinking, water, quality, one, and, a, half, years, after, the, event, the, iwmi, developed, protocols, for, cleaning, wells, contaminated, by, saltwater, these, were, subsequently, officially, endorsed, by, the, world, health, organization, as, part, of, its, series, of, emergency, guidelines, salted, over, soil, becomes, sterile, and, it, is, difficult, and, costly, to, restore, for, agriculture, it, also, causes, the, death, of, plants, and, important, soil, micro, organisms, thousands, of, rice, mango, and, banana, plantations, in, sri, lanka, were, destroyed, almost, entirely, and, will, take, years, to, recover, in, addition, to, other, forms, of, aid, the, australian, government, sent, ecological, experts, to, help, develop, strategies, for, reef, monitoring, and, rehabilitation, of, marine, environments, and, coral, reefs, in, the, maldives, seychelles, and, other, areas, scientists, had, developed, significant, ecological, expertise, from, work, with, the, great, barrier, reef, in, australia, s, northeastern, waters, in, response, to, the, unprecedented, situation, the, united, nations, environment, programme, unep, worked, with, governments, in, the, region, to, determine, the, severity, of, the, ecological, impact, and, how, to, address, it, unep, established, an, emergency, fund, set, up, a, task, force, to, respond, to, requests, for, assistance, from, countries, affected, by, the, tsunami, and, was, able, to, mobilize, and, distribute, approximately, us, 9, 3, million, for, environmental, recovery, and, disaster, risk, reduction, between, 2004, and, 2007, funding, came, from, other, international, agencies, and, from, countries, including, finland, norway, spain, sweden, and, the, united, kingdom, evidence, suggested, that, the, presence, of, mangroves, in, coastal, areas, had, provided, some, protection, when, compared, to, areas, that, had, been, cleared, for, aquaculture, or, development, as, a, result, mangrove, restoration, become, a, focus, of, a, number, of, projects, with, varied, success, such, approaches, to, ecosystem, based, disaster, risk, reduction, appear, to, be, most, successful, when, local, communities, are, closely, involved, as, stakeholders, throughout, the, process, and, when, careful, attention, is, paid, to, the, physical, conditions, of, chosen, sites, to, ensure, that, mangroves, can, thrive, there, the, level, of, damage, to, the, economy, resulting, from, the, tsunami, depends, on, the, scale, examined, while, the, overall, impact, on, the, national, economies, was, minor, local, economies, were, devastated, the, two, main, occupations, affected, by, the, tsunami, were, fishing, and, tourism, some, economists, believe, that, damage, to, the, affected, national, economies, will, be, minor, because, losses, in, the, tourism, and, fishing, industries, are, a, relatively, small, percentage, of, the, gdp, however, others, caution, that, damage, to, infrastructure, is, an, overriding, factor, in, some, areas, drinking, water, supplies, and, farm, fields, may, have, been, contaminated, for, years, by, saltwater, from, the, ocean, the, impact, on, coastal, fishing, communities, and, the, people, living, there, some, of, the, poorest, in, the, region, has, been, devastating, with, high, losses, of, income, earners, as, well, as, boats, and, fishing, gear, in, sri, lanka, artisanal, fishery, in, which, the, use, of, fish, baskets, fishing, traps, and, spears, are, commonly, used, is, an, important, source, of, fish, for, local, markets, industrial, fishery, is, the, major, economic, activity, providing, direct, employment, to, about, 250, 000, people, in, recent, years, the, fishery, industry, has, emerged, as, a, dynamic, export, oriented, sector, generating, substantial, foreign, exchange, earnings, preliminary, estimates, indicated, that, 66, of, the, fishing, fleet, and, industrial, infrastructure, in, coastal, regions, were, destroyed, by, the, wave, surges, while, the, tsunami, destroyed, many, of, the, boats, vital, to, sri, lanka, s, fishing, industry, it, also, created, a, demand, for, fibreglass, reinforced, plastic, catamarans, in, the, boatyards, of, tamil, nadu, given, that, over, 51, 000, vessels, were, lost, to, the, tsunami, the, industry, boomed, however, the, huge, demand, has, led, to, lower, quality, in, the, process, and, some, important, materials, were, sacrificed, to, cut, prices, for, those, who, were, impoverished, by, the, tsunami, even, though, only, coastal, regions, were, directly, affected, by, the, waters, of, the, tsunami, the, indirect, effects, have, spread, to, inland, provinces, as, well, since, the, media, coverage, of, the, event, was, so, extensive, many, tourists, cancelled, vacations, and, trips, to, that, part, of, the, world, even, though, their, travel, destinations, may, not, have, been, affected, this, ripple, effect, could, especially, be, felt, in, the, inland, provinces, of, thailand, such, as, krabi, which, acted, as, a, starting, point, for, many, other, tourist, destinations, in, thailand, countries, in, the, region, appealed, to, tourists, to, return, pointing, out, that, most, tourist, infrastructure, is, undamaged, however, tourists, were, reluctant, to, do, so, for, psychological, reasons, even, beach, resorts, in, parts, of, thailand, which, were, untouched, by, the, tsunami, were, hit, by, cancellations, both, the, earthquake, and, the, tsunami, may, have, affected, shipping, in, the, malacca, straits, which, separate, malaysia, and, the, indonesian, island, of, sumatra, by, changing, the, depth, of, the, seabed, and, by, disturbing, navigational, buoys, and, old, shipwrecks, in, one, area, of, the, strait, water, depths, were, previously, up, to, 1, 200, m, 4, 000, ft, and, are, now, only, 30, m, 100, ft, in, some, areas, making, shipping, impossible, and, dangerous, these, problems, also, made, the, delivery, of, relief, aid, more, challenging, compiling, new, navigational, charts, may, take, months, or, years, officials, also, hoped, that, piracy, in, the, region, would, drop, off, since, the, tsunami, had, killed, pirates, and, destroyed, their, boats, due, to, multiple, factors, there, was, a, 71, 6, drop, in, the, number, of, piracy, incidents, between, 2004, and, 2005, from, 60, to, 17, incidents, levels, remained, relatively, low, for, some, years, however, between, 2013, and, 2014, piracy, incidents, rose, dramatically, by, 73, 2, to, exceed, pre, tsunami, levels, the, last, major, tsunami, in, the, indian, ocean, was, about, a, d, 1400, in, 2008, a, team, of, scientists, working, on, phra, thong, a, barrier, island, along, the, hard, hit, west, coast, of, thailand, reported, evidence, of, at, least, three, previous, major, tsunamis, in, the, preceding, 2, 800, years, the, most, recent, from, about, 700, years, ago, a, second, team, found, similar, evidence, of, previous, tsunamis, in, aceh, a, province, at, the, northern, tip, of, sumatra, radiocarbon, dating, of, bark, fragments, in, the, soil, below, the, second, sand, layer, led, the, scientists, to, estimate, that, the, most, recent, predecessor, to, the, 2004, tsunami, probably, occurred, between, a, d, 1300, and, 1450, the, 2004, earthquake, and, tsunami, combined, is, the, world, s, deadliest, natural, disaster, since, the, 1976, tangshan, earthquake, the, earthquake, was, the, third, most, powerful, earthquake, recorded, since, 1900, the, deadliest, known, earthquake, in, history, occurred, in, 1556, in, shaanxi, china, with, an, estimated, death, toll, of, 830, 000, though, figures, from, this, period, may, not, be, as, reliable, before, 2004, the, tsunami, created, in, both, indian, and, pacific, ocean, waters, by, the, 1883, eruption, of, krakatoa, thought, to, have, resulted, in, anywhere, from, 36, 000, to, 120, 000, deaths, had, probably, been, the, deadliest, in, the, region, in, 1782, about, 40, 000, people, are, thought, to, have, been, killed, by, a, tsunami, or, a, cyclone, in, the, south, china, sea, the, deadliest, tsunami, before, 2004, was, italy, s, 1908, messina, earthquake, on, the, mediterranean, sea, where, the, earthquake, and, tsunami, killed, about, 123, 000, many, health, professionals, and, aid, workers, have, reported, widespread, psychological, trauma, associated, with, the, tsunami, even, 14, years, afterwards, researchers, find, hpa, axis, dysregulation, and, burnout, in, survivors, traditional, beliefs, in, many, of, the, affected, regions, state, that, a, relative, of, the, family, must, bury, the, body, of, the, dead, and, in, many, cases, no, body, remained, to, be, buried, women, in, aceh, required, a, special, approach, from, foreign, aid, agencies, and, continue, to, have, unique, needs, the, hardest, hit, area, aceh, is, a, religiously, conservative, islamic, society, and, has, had, no, tourism, nor, any, western, presence, in, recent, years, due, to, the, insurgency, between, the, indonesian, military, and, free, aceh, movement, gam, some, believe, that, the, tsunami, was, divine, punishment, for, lay, muslims, shirking, their, daily, prayers, or, following, a, materialistic, lifestyle, others, have, said, that, allah, was, angry, that, muslims, were, killing, each, other, in, an, ongoing, conflict, saudi, cleric, muhammad, al, munajjid, attributed, it, to, divine, retribution, against, non, muslim, vacationers, who, used, to, sprawl, all, over, the, beaches, and, in, pubs, overflowing, with, wine, during, christmas, break, the, widespread, devastation, caused, by, the, tsunami, led, gam, to, declare, a, cease, fire, on, 28, december, 2004, followed, by, the, indonesian, government, and, the, two, groups, resumed, long, stalled, peace, talks, which, resulted, in, a, peace, agreement, signed, 15, august, 2005, the, agreement, explicitly,
