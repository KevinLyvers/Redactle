portion, of, the, balhae, people, whose, links, to, goguryeo, were, shared, with, goryeo, accepting, most, of, their, royalty, and, nobility, in, their, fold, following, the, destruction, of, balhae, by, the, khitan, liao, dynasty, in, 927, the, last, crown, prince, of, balhae, and, much, of, the, ruling, class, sought, refuge, in, goryeo, where, they, were, warmly, welcomed, and, given, land, by, taejo, in, addition, taejo, included, the, balhae, crown, prince, in, the, goryeo, royal, family, unifying, the, two, successor, states, of, goguryeo, and, according, to, korean, historians, achieving, a, true, national, unification, of, korea, according, to, the, goryeosa, jeolyo, the, balhae, refugees, who, accompanied, the, crown, prince, numbered, in, the, tens, of, thousands, of, households, as, descendants, of, goguryeo, the, balhae, people, and, the, goryeo, dynasts, were, related, taejo, felt, a, strong, familial, kinship, with, balhae, calling, it, his, relative, country, and, married, country, and, protected, the, balhae, refugees, this, was, in, stark, contrast, to, later, silla, which, had, endured, a, hostile, relationship, with, balhae, taejo, displayed, strong, animosity, toward, the, khitans, who, had, destroyed, balhae, the, liao, dynasty, sent, 30, envoys, with, 50, camels, as, a, gift, in, 942, but, taejo, exiled, the, envoys, to, an, island, and, starved, the, camels, under, a, bridge, in, what, is, known, as, the, manbu, bridge, incident, taejo, proposed, to, gaozu, of, later, jin, that, they, attack, the, khitans, in, retribution, for, balhae, according, to, the, zizhi, tongjian, furthermore, in, his, ten, injunctions, to, his, descendants, he, stated, that, the, khitans, are, savage, beasts, and, should, be, guarded, against, exodus, en, masse, on, part, from, the, balhae, refugees, would, continue, on, at, least, until, the, early, 12th, century, during, the, reign, of, king, yejong, due, to, this, constant, massive, influx, of, balhae, refugees, the, goguryeoic, population, in, goryeo, is, speculated, to, have, become, dominant, in, proportion, compared, to, their, silla, and, baekje, counterparts, that, have, experienced, devastating, war, and, political, strife, since, the, advent, of, the, later, three, kingdoms, by, the, end, of, the, later, three, kingdoms, territories, populated, by, the, original, silla, people, and, considered, that, of, silla, proper, were, reduced, to, gyeongju, and, bits, of, the, vicinity, later, baekje, fared, only, little, better, than, later, silla, before, its, fall, in, 936, meanwhile, of, the, three, capitals, of, goryeo, two, were, kaesong, and, pyongyang, which, were, initially, populated, by, goguryeoic, settlers, from, the, paeseo, region, and, balhae, nonetheless, goryeo, proceeded, to, peacefully, absorbing, the, ruling, class, of, both, countries, and, incorporated, them, under, its, bureaucracy, conducting, political, marriages, and, distributing, positions, according, to, their, previous, status, in, their, respective, countries, in, contrast, to, silla, s, bone, rank, system, these, open, policies, implemented, by, wang, geon, enabled, goryeo, to, enjoy, a, larger, pool, of, highly, skilled, bureaucrats, and, technicians, with, the, addition, of, those, coming, from, silla, and, baekje, later, on, instilling, a, single, agenda, in, terms, of, identity, amongst, its, people, during, the, time, of, its, existence, goryeo, also, accepted, a, large, amount, of, skilled, workers, from, medieval, china, and, tamna, as, well, although, goryeo, had, unified, the, korean, peninsula, the, hojok, regional, lords, remained, quasi, independent, within, their, walled, domains, and, posed, a, threat, to, the, monarchy, to, secure, political, alliances, taejo, married, 29, women, from, prominent, hojok, families, siring, 25, sons, and, 9, daughters, his, fourth, son, gwangjong, came, to, power, in, 949, to, become, the,

hojok, during, the, tumultuous, later, three, kingdoms, period, in, effect, decreasing, the, power, and, influence, of, the, regional, nobility, and, increasing, the, population, liable, for, taxation, by, the, central, government, in, 958, advised, by, shuang, ji, a, naturalized, chinese, official, from, the, later, zhou, dynasty, gwangjong, implemented, the, gwageo, civil, service, examinations, based, primarily, on, the, imperial, examination, of, the, tang, dynasty, this, too, was, to, consolidate, monarchical, authority, the, gwageo, remained, an, important, institution, in, korea, until, its, abolition, in, 1894, in, contrast, to, goryeo, s, traditional, dual, royal, imperial, structure, under, which, the, ruler, was, at, once, king, emperor, and, son, of, heaven, according, to, remco, e, breuker, gwangjong, used, a, full, blown, imperial, system, all, those, who, opposed, or, resisted, his, reforms, were, summarily, purged, gwangjong, s, successor, gyeongjong,

of, goryeo, since, the, reign, of, taejo, of, goryeo, r, 918, 943, who, called, upon, them, during, the, wars, of, the, later, three, kingdoms, period, taejo, relied, heavily, on, a, large, jurchen, cavalry, force, to, defeat, later, baekje, the, jurchens, switched, allegiances, between, liao, and, goryeo, multiple, times, depending, on, which, they, deemed, the, most, appropriate, the, liao, and, goryeo, competed, to, gain, the, allegiance, of, jurchen, settlers, who, effectively, controlled, much, of, the, border, area, beyond, goryeo, and, liao, fortifications, these, jurchens, offered, tribute, but, expected, to, be, rewarded, richly, by, the, goryeo, court, in, return, however, the, jurchens, who, offered, tribute, were, often, the, same, ones, who, raided, goryeo, s, borders, in, one, instance, the, goryeo, court, discovered, that, a, jurchen, leader, who, had, brought, tribute, had, been, behind, the, recent, raids, on, their, territory, the, frontier, was, largely, outside, of, direct, control, and, lavish, gifts, were, doled, out, as, a, means, of, controlling, the, jurchens, sometimes, jurchens, submitted, to, goryeo, and, were, given, citizenship, goryeo, inhabitants, were, forbidden, from, trading, with, jurchens, the, tributary, relations, between, jurchens, and, goryeo, began, to, change, under, the, reign, of, jurchen, leader, wuyashu, r, 1103, 1113, of, the, wanyan, clan, the, wanyan, clan, was, intimately, aware, of, the, jurchens, who, had, submitted, to, goryeo, and, used, their, power, to, break, the, clans, allegiance, to, goryeo, unifying, the, jurchens, the, resulting, conflict, between, the, two, powers, led, to, goryeo, s, withdrawal, from, jurchen, territory, and, acknowledgment, of, jurchen, control, over, the, contested, region, as, the, geopolitical, situation, shifted, goryeo, unleashed, a, series, of, military, campaigns, in, the, early, 12th, century, to, regain, control, of, its, borderlands, goryeo, had, already, been, in, conflict, with, the, jurchens, before, in, 984, goryeo, failed, to, control, the, yalu, river, basin, due, to, conflict, with, the, jurchens, in, 1056, goryeo, repelled, the, eastern, jurchens, and, afterward, destroyed, their, stronghold, of, over, 20, villages, in, 1080, munjong, of, goryeo, led, a, force, of, 30, 000, to, conquer, ten, villages, however, by, the, rise, of, the, wanyan, clan, the, quality, of, goryeo, s, army, had, degraded, and, it, mostly, consisted, of, infantry, there, were, several, clashes, with, the, jurchens, usually, resulting, in, jurchen, victory, with, their, mounted, cavalrymen, in, 1104, the, wanyan, jurchens, reached, chongju, while, pursuing, tribes, resisting, them, goryeo, sent, im, gan, to, confront, the, jurchens, but, his, untrained, army, was, defeated, and, the, jurchens, took, chongju, castle, im, gan, was, dismissed, from, office, and, reinstated, dying, as, a, civil, servant, in, 1112, the, war, effort, was, taken, up, by, yun, kwan, but, the, situation, was, unfavorable, and, he, returned, after, making, peace, yun, kwan, believed, that, the, loss, was, due, to, their, inferior, cavalry, and, proposed, to, the, king, that, an, elite, force, known, as, the, byeolmuban, special, warfare, army, be, created, it, existed, apart, from, the, main, army, and, was, made, up, of, cavalry, infantry, and, a, hangmagun, subdue, demon, corps, in, december, 1107, yun, kwan, and, o, y, n, ch, on, set, out, with, 170, 000, soldiers, to, conquer, the, jurchens, the, army, won, against, the, jurchens, and, built, nine, fortresses, over, a, wide, area, on, the, frontier, encompassing, jurchen, tribal, lands, and, erected, a, monument, to, mark, the, boundary, however, due, to, unceasing, jurchen, attacks, diplomatic, appeals, and, court, intrigue, the, nine, fortresses, were, handed, back, to, the, jurchens, in, 1108, yun, kwan, was, removed, from, office, and, the, nine, fortresses, were, turned, over, to, the, wanyan, clan, it, is, plausible, that, the, jurchens, and, goryeo, had, some, sort, of, implicit, understanding, where, the, jurchens, would, cease, their, attacks, while, goryeo, took, advantage, of, the, conflict, between, the, jurchens, and, khitans, to, gain, territory, according, to, breuker, goryeo, never, really, had, control, of, the, region, occupied, by, the, nine, fortresses, in, the, first, place, and, maintaining, hegemony, would, have, meant, a, prolonged, conflict, with, militarily, superior, jurchen, troops, that, would, prove, very, costly, the, nine, fortresses, were, exchanged, for, poju, uiju, a, region, the, jurchens, later, contested, when, goryeo, hesitated, to, recognize, them, as, their, suzerain, later, wuyashu, s, younger, brother, aguda, founded, the, jin, dynasty, 1115, 1234, when, the, jin, was, founded, the, jurchens, called, goryeo, their, parent, country, or, father, and, mother, country, this, was, because, it, had, traditionally, been, part, of, their, system, of, tributary, relations, its, rhetoric, advanced, culture, as, well, as, the, idea, that, it, was, bastard, offspring, of, kory, the, jin, also, believed, that, they, shared, a, common, ancestry, with, the, balhae, people, in, the, liao, dynasty, the, jin, went, on, to, conquer, the, liao, dynasty, in, 1125, and, capture, the, song, capital, of, kaifeng, in, 1127, jingkang, incident, the, jin, also, put, pressure, on, goryeo, and, demanded, that, goryeo, become, their, subject, while, many, in, goryeo, were, against, this, yi, cha, gy, m, was, in, power, at, the, time, and, judged, peaceful, relations, with, the, jin, to, be, beneficial, to, his, own, political, power, he, accepted, the, jin, demands, and, in, 1126, the, king, of, goryeo, declared, himself, a, jin, vassal, tributary, however, the, goryeo, king, retained, his, position, as, son, of, heaven, within, goryeo, by, incorporating, jurchen, history, into, that, of, goryeo, and, emphasizing, the, jin, emperors, as, bastard, offspring, of, goryeo, and, placing, the, jin, within, the, template, of, a, northern, dynasty, the, imposition, of, jin, suzerainty, became, more, acceptable, the, inju, yi, clan, married, women, to, the, kings, from, the, time, of, munjong, to, the, 17th, king, injong, eventually, the, inju, yi, clan, gained, more, power, than, the, monarch, himself, this, led, to, the, coup, of, yi, cha, gy, m, in, 1126, it, failed, but, the, power, of, the, monarch, was, weakened, goryeo, underwent, a, civil, war, among, the, nobility, in, 1135, myocheong, argued, in, favor, of,

into, manchuria, the, other, one, led, by, kim, bu, sik, author, of, the, samguk, sagi, wanted, to, keep, the, status, quo, myocheong, failed, to, persuade, the, king, he, rebelled, and, established, the, state, of, daebang, but, it, failed, and, he, was, killed, although, goryeo, was, founded, by, the, military, its, authority, was, in, decline, in, 1014, a, coup, occurred, but, the, effects, of,

multiple, calendars, in, 938, it, used, the, later, jin, calendar, in, 948, later, han, in, 952, later, zhou, in, 963, song, in, 994, liao, in, 1016, song, and, in, 1022, liao, in, 1136, goryeo, was, presented, with, a, jin, calendar, it, is, possible, that, goryeo, used, different, calendars, simultaneously, depending, on, which, country, they, dealt, with, at, the, time, of, goryeo, korean, nobility, was, divided, into, 6, classes, also, the, title, taeja, was, given, to, sons, of, monarch, in, most, other, east, asian, countries, this, title, meant, crown, prince, taeja, was, similar, to, daegun, or, gun, of, the, joseon, dynasty, buddhism, in, medieval, korea, evolved, in, ways, which, rallied, support, for, the, state, initially, the, new, seon, schools, were, regarded, by, the, established, doctrinal, schools, as, radical, and, dangerous, upstarts, thus, the, early, founders, of, the, various, nine, mountain, monasteries, met, with, considerable, resistance, repressed, by, the, long, influence, in, court, of, the, gyo, schools, the, struggles, which, ensued, continued, for, most, of, the, goryeo, period, but, gradually, the, seon, argument, for, the, possession, of, the, true, transmission, of, enlightenment, would, gain, the, upper, hand, the, position, that, was, generally, adopted, in, the, later, seon, schools, due, in, large, part, to, the, efforts, of, jinul, did, not, claim, clear, superiority, of, seon, meditational, methods, but, rather, declared, the, intrinsic, unity, and, similarities, of, the, seon, and, gyo, viewpoints, although, all, these, schools, are, mentioned, in, historical, records, toward, the, end, of, the, dynasty, seon, became, dominant, in, its, effect, on, the, government, and, society, and, the, production, of, noteworthy, scholars, and, adepts, during, the, goryeo, period, seon, thoroughly, became, a, religion, of, the, state, receiving, extensive, support, and, privileges, through, connections, with, the, ruling, family, and, powerful, members, of, the, court, although, buddhist, predominated, taoism, was, practiced, in, some, temples, as, was, shamanism, although, most, of, the, scholastic, schools, waned, in, activity, and, influence, during, this, period, of, the, growth, of, seon, the, hwaeom, school, continued, to, be, a, lively, source, of, scholarship, well, into, the, goryeo, much, of, it, continuing, the, legacy, of, uisang, and, wonhyo, in, particular, the, work, of, gyunyeo, 923, 973, prepared, for, the, reconciliation, of, hwaeom, and, seon, with, hwaeom, s, accommodating, attitude, toward, the, latter, gyunyeo, s, works, are, an, important, source, for, modern, scholarship, in, identifying, the, distinctive, nature, of, korean, hwaeom, another, important, advocate, of, seon, gyo, unity, was, uicheon, like, most, other, early, goryeo, monks, he, began, his, studies, in, buddhism, with, the, hwaeom, school, he, later, traveled, to, china, and, upon, his, return, actively, promulgated, the, cheontae, or, tiantai, in, chinese, teachings, which, became, recognized, as, another, seon, school, this, period, thus, came, to, be, described, as, five, doctrinal, and, two, meditational, schools, ogyo, yangjong, uicheon, himself, however, alienated, too, many, seon, adherents, and, he, died, at, a, relatively, young, age, without, seeing, a, seon, gyo, unity, accomplished, the, most, important, figure, of, seon, in, the, goryeo, was, jinul, 1158, 1210, in, his, time, the, sangha, was, in, a, crisis, of, external, appearance, and, internal, issues, of, doctrine, buddhism, had, gradually, become, infected, by, secular, tendencies, and, involvements, such, as, fortune, telling, and, the, offering, of, prayers, and, rituals, for, success, in, secular, endeavors, this, kind, of, corruption, resulted, in, the, profusion, of, increasingly, larger, numbers, of, monks, and, nuns, with, questionable, motivations, therefore, the, correction, revival, and, improvement, of, the, quality, of, buddhism, were, prominent, issues, for, buddhist, leaders, of, the, period, jinul, sought, to, establish, a, new, movement, within, korean, seon, which, he, called, the, sam, dhi, and, praj, society, whose, goal, was, to, establish, a, new, community, of, disciplined, pure, minded, practitioners, deep, in, the, mountains, he, eventually, accomplished, this, mission, with, the, founding, of, the, seonggwangsa, monastery, at, mt, jogye, jinul, s, works, are, characterized, by, a, thorough, analysis, and, reformulation, of, the, methodologies, of, seon, study, and, practice, one, major, issue, that, had, long, fermented, in, chinese, seon, and, which, received, special, focus, from, jinul, was, the, relationship, between, gradual, and, sudden, methods, in, practice, and, enlightenment, drawing, upon, various, chinese, treatments, of, this, topic, most, importantly, those, by, zongmi, 780, 841, and, dahui, 1089, 1163, jinul, created, a, sudden, enlightenment, followed, by, gradual, practice, dictum, which, he, outlined, in, a, few, relatively, concise, and, accessible, texts, from, dahui, jinul, also, incorporated, the, gwanhwa, method, into, his, practice, this, form, of, meditation, is, the, main, method, taught, in, korean, seon, today, jinul, s, philosophical, resolution, of, the, seon, gyo, conflict, brought, a, deep, and, lasting, effect, on, korean, buddhism, the, general, trend, of, buddhism, in, the, latter, half, of, the, goryeo, was, a, decline, due, to, corruption, and, the, rise, of, strong, anti, buddhist, political, and, philosophical, sentiment, however, this, period, of, relative, decadence, would, nevertheless, produce, some, of, korea, s, most, renowned, seon, masters, three, important, monks, of, this, period, who, figured, prominently, in, charting, the, future, course, of, korean, seon, were, contemporaries, and, friends, gyeonghan, baeg, un, 1298, 1374, taego, bou, 1301, 1382, and, naong, hyegeun, 1320, 1376, all, three, went, to, yuan, china, to, learn, the, linji, or, imje, in, korean, gwanhwa, teaching, that, had, been, popularized, by, jinul, all, three, returned, and, established, the, sharp, confrontational, methods, of, the, imje, school, in, their, own, teaching, each, of, the, three, was, also, said, to, have, had, hundreds, of, disciples, such, that, this, new, infusion, into, korean, seon, brought, about, considerable, effect, despite, the, imje, influence, which, was, generally, considered, to, be, anti, scholarly, in, nature, gyeonghan, and, naong, under, the, influence, of, jinul, and, the, traditional, tongbulgyo, tendency, showed, an, unusual, interest, in, scriptural, study, as, well, as, a, strong, understanding, of, confucianism, and, taoism, due, to, the, increasing, influence, of, chinese, philosophy, as, the, foundation, of, official, education, from, this, time, a, marked, tendency, for, korean, buddhist, monks, to, be, three, teachings, exponents, appeared, a, significant, historical, event, of, the, goryeo, period, is, the, production, of, the, first, woodblock, edition, of, the, tripitaka, called, the, tripitaka, koreana, two, editions, were, made, the, first, one, completed, from, 1210, to, 1231, and, the, second, one, from, 1214, to, 1259, the, first, edition, was, destroyed, in, a, fire, during, an, attack, by, mongol, invaders, in, 1232, but, the, second, edition, is, still, in, existence, at, haeinsa, in, gyeongsang, province, this, edition, of, the, tripitaka, was, of, high, quality, and, served, as, the, standard, version, of, the, tripitaka, in, east, asia, for, almost, 700, years, gwangjong, created, the, national, civil, service, examinations, seongjong, was, a, key, figure, in, establishing, confucianism, he, founded, gukjagam, the, highest, educational, institution, of, the, goryeo, dynasty, this, was, facilitated, by, the, establishment, in, 1398, of, the, sungkyunkwan, an, academy, with, a, confucian, curriculum, and, the, building, of, an, altar, at, the, palace, where, the, king, would, worship, his, ancestors, according, to, goryeosa, muslims, arrived, in, the, peninsula, in,

it, was, during, this, period, satirical, poems, were, composed, and, one, of, them, was, the, sanghwajeom, the, colored, eye, people, bakery, the, song, tells, the, tale, of, a, korean, woman, who, goes, to, a, muslim, bakery, to, buy, some, dumplings, small, scale, contact, with, predominantly, muslim, peoples, continued, on, and, off, during, the, late, goryeo, period, there, were, mosques, in, the, capital, kaesong, called, ye, kung, whose, literary, meaning, is, a, ceremonial, hall, one, of, those, central, asian, immigrants, to, korea, originally, came, to, korea, as, an, aide, to, a,

quickly, became, a, popular, drink, while, the, stationed, region, of, mongolian, troops, came, to, produce, high, quality, soju, for, instance, in, andong, the, official, histories, of, early, korea, such, as, the, samguk, sagi, and, samguk, yusa, written, in, classical, chinese, remain, some, of, the, most, important, historical, works, in, korean, historiography, 264, various, writing, systems, that, utilized, the, phonetic, value, of, hanja, characters, were, used, to, transcribe, old, korean, idu, being, the, most, notable, of, them, as, it, was, used, for, administrative, purposes, and, recordkeeping, this, script, originates, in, goguryeo, and, was, designed, for, a, very, specific, sort, of, syntax, that, made, use, of, postpositional, particles, such, as, the, old, korean,

to, the, 12th, century, and, was, supposed, to, tell, the, reader, the, meaning, of, the, text, and, was, meant, to, be, read, in, old, korean, the, later, form, of, gugyeol, appearing, in, the, 13th, century, was, meant, to, make, it, possible, to, spell, out, the, middle, chinese, poem, for, the, average, reader, who, would, not, know, how, chinese, sounded, by, inferring, the, koreanized, pronunciation, on, it, instead, hyangga, poetry, which, made, use, of, hyangchal, another, writing, system, used, to, write, old, korean, was, contrary, to, common, belief, still, widespread, during, goryeo, and, a, number, of, the, surviving, poems, that, were, attributed, to, the, unified, silla, period, have, been, revealed, to, have, been, created, during, goryeo, the, cheoyongga, is, one, of, these, examples, a, story, about, a, man, and, his, unfaithful, wife, the, goryeo, aristocracy, emphasized, engaging, with, high, literature, and, court, poetry, in, classical, chinese, learning,

of, approximately, 80, 000, pages, the, wooden, blocks, that, were, used, to, print, it, are, stored, in, haeinsa, temple, in, south, gyeongsang, province, the, second, version, was, made, in, 1251, by, gojong, in, an, attempt, invoke, the, power, of, buddhism, to, fend, off, the, mongol, invasion, the, wooden, blocks, are, kept, clean, by, leaving, them, to, dry, outside, every, year, the, tripi, aka, koreana, was, designated, a, national, treasure, of, south, korea, in, 1962, and, inscribed, in, the, unesco, memory, of, the, world, register, in, 2007, the, ceramics, of, goryeo, are, considered, by, some, to, be, the, finest, small, scale, works, of, ceramics, in, korean, history, key, fret, foliate, designs, geometric, or, scrolling, flowerhead, bands, elliptical, panels, stylized, fish, and, insects, and, the, use, of, incised, designs, began, at, this, time, glazes, were, usually, various, shades, of, celadon, with, browned, glazes, to, almost, black, glazes, being, used, for, stoneware, and, storage, celadon, glazes, could, be, rendered, almost, transparent, to, show, black, and, white, inlays, while, the, forms, generally, seen, are, broad, shouldered, bottles, larger, low, bowls, or, shallow, smaller, bowls, highly, decorated, celadon, cosmetic, boxes, and, small, slip, inlaid, cups, the, buddhist, potteries, also, produced, melon, shaped, vases,

similar, to, korean, metalware, wine, cups, often, had, a, tall, foot, which, rested, on, dish, shaped, stands, during, the, goryeo, period, lacquerware, with, mother, of, pearl, inlay, reached, a, high, point, of, technical, and, aesthetic, achievement, and, was, widely, used, by, members, of, the, aristocracy, for, buddhist, ritual, implements, and, vessels, as, well, as, horse, saddles, and, royal, carriages, inlaid, lacquers, combine, texture, color, and, shape, to, produce, a, dazzling, effect, in, both, large, and, small, objects, although, korean, lacquerware, of, the, goryeo, period, was, highly, prized, throughout, east, asia, fewer, than, fifteen, examples, are, known, to, have, survived, one, of, which, is, this, exquisite, box, in, the, museum, s, collection, this, paucity, of, material, is, largely, attributable, to, the, fragility, of, lacquer, objects, and, to, a, certain, extent, to, wars, and, raids, by, foreign, powers, notably, those, launched, from, japan, by, toyotomi, hideyoshi, 1536, 1598, in, the, late, sixteenth, century, more, info, on, goryeo, lacquerware, these, ceramics, are, of, a, hard, porcellaneous, body, with, porcelain, stone, as, one, of, the, key, ingredients, however, it, is, not, to, be, confused, with, porcelain, the, body, is, low, clay, quartz, rich, high, potassia, and, virtually, identical, in, composition, to, the, chinese, yueh, ceramics, which, scholars, hypothesize, occasioned, the, first, production, of, celadon, in, korea, the, glaze, is, an, ash, glaze, with, iron, colourant, fired, in, a, reduction, atmosphere, in, a, modified, chinese, style, dragon, kiln, the, distinctive, blue, grey, green, of, korean, celadon, is, caused, by, the, iron, content, of, the, glaze, with, a, minimum, of, titanium, contaminant, which, modifies, the, color, to, a, greener, cast, as, can, be, seen, in, chinese, yueh, wares, however, the, goryeo, potters, took, the, glaze, in, a, different, direction, than, their, chinese, forebears, instead, of, relying, solely, on, underglaze, incised, designs, they, eventually, developed, the, sanggam, technique, of, inlaying, black, magnetite, and, white, quartz, which, created, bold, contrast, with, the, glaze, scholars, also, theorize, that, this, developed, in, part, to, an, inlay, tradition, in, korean, metalworks, and, lacquer, and, also, to, the, dissatisfaction, with, the, nearly, invisible, effect, of, incising, when, done, under, a, thick, celadon, glaze, a, revival, of, goryeo, celadon, pottery, began, in, the, early, 20th, century, playing, a, leading, role, in, its, revival, was, yu, geun, hyeong, a, living, national, treasure, whose, work, was, documented, in, the, 1979, short, film, koryo, celadon, it, is, generally,
