princely, titles, the, rurik, dynasty, also, known, as, the, rurikid, or, riurikid, dynasty, as, well, as, simply, rurikids, or, riurikids, was, a, noble, lineage, allegedly, founded, by, the, varangian, prince, rurik, who, according, to, tradition, established, himself, at, novgorod, in, the, year, 862, the, rurikids, were, the, ruling, dynasty, of, kievan, rus, and, its, principalities, following, its, disintegration, the, romanovichi, ruled, the, southwestern, territories, which, were, unified, by, roman, the, great, and, his, son, daniel, who, was, in, 1253, crowned, by, pope, innocent, iv, as, the, king, of, ruthenia, galicia, volhynia, was, eventually, annexed, by, poland, and, lithuania, the, northern, and, northeastern, territories, were, unified, by, the, daniilovichi, of, moscow, by, the, 15th, century, ivan, iii, threw, off, the, control, of, the, golden, horde, and, assumed, the, title, of, sovereign, of, all, russia, ivan, iv, was, crowned, as, the, tsar, of, all, russia, where, the, rurik, line, ruled, until, 1598, following, which, they, were, eventually, succeeded, by, the, house, of, romanov, as, a, ruling, house, the, rurikids, held, their, own, for, a, total, of, 21, generations, in, male, line, succession, from, rurik, d, 879, to, feodor, i, of, russia, d, 1598, a, period, of, more, than, 700, years, numerous, princely, families, have, claimed, to, trace, their, lineage, to, rurik, they, are, one, of, europe, s, oldest, royal, houses, with, numerous, existing, cadet, branches, the, origins, of, the, rurikids, are, unclear, as, its, namesake, rurik, a, varangian, prince, who, allegedly, founded, the, dynasty, in, 862, through, the, calling, of, the, varangians, is, considered, to, be, a, legendary, mythical, and, perhaps, even, entirely, fictional, character, by, modern, scholars, nicholas, v, riasanovsky, 1947, stated, no, kievan, sources, anterior, to, the, primary, chronicle, early, twelfth, century, knew, of, riurik, in, tracing, the, ancestry, of, kievan, princes, they, usually, stopped, with, igor, as, an, example, hilarion, of, kiev, s, sermon, on, law, and, grace, 1050s, praising, volodimer, i, of, kiev, only, goes, back, to, his, father, sviatoslav, i, and, grandfather, igor, of, kiev, even, if, rurik, did, exist, scholars, have, long, doubted, or, rejected, his, paternity, of, igor, the, connections, between, rurik, oleg, and, igor, as, attested, in, the, primary, chronicle, and, novgorod, first, chronicle, are, tenuous, at, best, in, all, other, cases, these, two, chronicles, base, any, particular, ruler, s, legitimacy, on, the, fact, that, their, father, or, grandfather, previously, sat, on, the, throne, in, kiev, and, never, refer, back, to, rurik, legitimacy, in, the, kievan, chronicle, is, also, heavily, based, on, a, ruler, being, descended, from, his, father, and, grandfather, with, the, exception, of, two, 5, generation, lists, before, the, mid, 15th, century, no, historical, source, claims, that, rurik, founded, a, dynasty, the, hypatian, codex, of, c, 1425, began, its, list, of, knyazi, of, kiev, with, dir, and, askold, then, oleg, then, igor, up, to, 1240, and, does, not, mention, rurik, anywhere, it, was, not, until, the, 16th, century, that, rus, churchmen, developed, an, explicit, tradition, described, in, the, 1560, book, of, royal, degrees, by, macarius, metropolitan, of, moscow, according, to, which, the, reigning, danilovichi, house, of, the, grand, duchy, of, moscow, muscovy, was, part, of, a, rurikid, dynasty, which, not, only, traced, back, all, the, way, to, the, legendary, rurik, but, was, purportedly, descended, from, a, certain, prus, a, supposed, kinsman, of, augustus, caesar, according, ostrowski, 2018, the, rus, churchmen, developed, this, concept, of, a, r, i, urikid, dynasty, for, the, purpose, of, bolstering, the, muscovite, dynastic, state, although, many, later, historians, would, accept, the, 16th, century, rus, churchmen, s, dynastic, claim, that, the, danilovichi, were, descended, from, rurik, they, did, not, accept, prus, as, the, ancestor, of, the, muscovite, princes, because, of, these, issues, various, scholars, have, instead, named, the, dynasty, the, volodimerovichi, descendants, of, grand, prince, volodimer, i, of, kiev, the, scholarly, consensus, is, that, the, rus, people, originated, in, what, is, currently, coastal, eastern, sweden, around, the, eighth, century, and, that, their, name, has, the, same, origin, as, roslagen, in, sweden, with, the, older, name, being, roden, according, to, the, prevalent, theory, the, name, rus, like, the, proto, finnic, name, for, sweden, ruotsi, is, derived, from, an, old, norse, term, for, the, men, who, row, rods, as, rowing, was, the, main, method, of, navigating, the, rivers, of, eastern, europe, and, that, it, could, be, linked, to, the, swedish, coastal, area, of, roslagen, rus, law, or, roden, as, it, was, known, in, earlier, times, the, name, rus, would, then, have, the, same, origin, as, the, finnish, and, estonian, names, for, sweden, ruotsi, and, rootsi, the, primary, chronicle, gives, the, following, account, the, calling, of, the, varangians, dating, it, to, the, byzantine, years, of, the, world, 6368, 6370, ad, 860, 862, the, tributaries, of, the, varangians, drove, them, back, beyond, the, sea, and, refusing, them, further, tribute, set, out, to, govern, themselves, there, was, no, law, among, them, but, tribe, rose, against, tribe, discord, thus, ensued, among, them, and, they, began, to, war, one, against, another, they, said, to, themselves, let, us, seek, a, prince, who, may, rule, over, us, and, judge, us, according, to, the, law, they, accordingly, went, overseas, to, the, varangian, russes, these, particular, varangians, were, known, as, russes, just, as, some, are, called, swedes, and, others, normans, english, and, gotlanders, for, they, were, thus, named, the, chuds, the, slavs, the, krivichians, and, the, ves, then, said, to, the, people, of, rus, our, land, is, great, and, rich, but, there, is, no, order, in, it, come, to, rule, and, reign, over, us, they, thus, selected, three, brothers, with, their, kinsfolk, who, took, with, them, all, the, russes, and, migrated, the, oldest, rurik, located, himself, in, novgorod, the, second, sineus, at, beloozero, and, the, third, truvor, in, izborsk, on, account, of, these, varangians, the, district, of, novgorod, became, known, as, the, land, of, rus, the, present, inhabitants, of, novgorod, are, descended, from, the, varangian, race, but, aforetime, they, were, slavs, there, is, some, ambiguity, even, in, the, primary, chronicle, about, the, specifics, of, the, story, hence, their, paradoxical, statement, the, people, of, novgorod, are, of, varangian, stock, for, formerly, they, were, slovenes, however, archaeological, evidence, such, as, frankish, swords, a, sword, chape, and, a, tortoiseshell, brooch, in, the, area, suggest, that, there, was, in, fact, a, scandinavian, population, during, the, tenth, century, at, the, latest, a, genetic, study, on, the, origins, of, rurikids, zhur, et, al, 2023, analysed, for, the, first, time, remains, belonging, to, prince, dmitry, alexandrovich, the, study, found, that, dmitry, alexandrovich, and, most, of, the, medieval, and, modern, rurikids, starting, with, prince, yaroslav, the, wise, belong, to, paternal, haplogroup, n, m231, n1a, the, genetic, results, suggest, that, the, formation, of, the, rurikid, lineage, included, a, population, from, eastern, scandinavia, land, a, population, from, central, europe, or, the, iron, age, eurasian, steppe, and, an, east, asian, component, via, siberian, geneflow, to, northeastern, europe, rurik, and, his, brothers, founded, a, state, that, later, historians, called, kievan, rus, by, the, middle, of, the, twelfth, century, kievan, rus, had, dissolved, into, independent, principalities, each, ruled, by, a, different, branch, of, the, rurikid, house, the, dynasty, followed, agnatic, seniority, and, the, izgoi, principle, the, house, underwent, a, major, schism, after, the, death, of, yaroslav, the, wise, in, 1054, dividing, into, three, branches, on, the, basis, of, descent, from, three, successive, ruling, grand, princes, iziaslav, 1024, 1078, sviatoslav, 1027, 1076, and, vsevolod, 1030, 1093, in, addition, a, line, of, polotsk, princes, assimilated, themselves, with, the, princes, of, lithuania, in, the, 10th, century, the, council, of, liubech, made, some, amendments, to, a, succession, rule, and, divided, ruthenia, into, several, autonomous, principalities, that, had, equal, rights, to, obtain, the, kievan, throne, vsevolod, s, line, eventually, became, better, known, as, the, monomakhovichi, and, was, the, predominant, one, the, line, of, sviatoslav, later, became, known, as, olegovychi, and, often, laid, claim, to, the, lands, of, chernihiv, and, severia, the, izyaslavychi, who, ruled, turov, and, volhynia, were, eventually, replaced, by, a, monomakhovychi, branch, according, to, jaroslav, pelenski, the, riurikide, dynasty, and, the, ruling, elite, attempted, to, impose, on, their, highly, diverse, polity, the, integrative, concept, of, russkaia, zemlia, the, rus, land, and, the, unifying, notion, of, a, rus, people, but, kievan, rus, was, never, really, a, unified, polity, it, was, a, loosely, bound, ill, defined, and, heterogeneous, conglomeration, of, lands, and, cities, inhabited, by, tribes, and, population, groups, whose, loyalties, were, primarily, territorial, this, caused, the, rurikid, house, to, effectively, dissolve, into, several, sub, dynasties, ruling, smaller, states, in, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, these, were, the, olgoviches, of, severia, who, ruled, in, chernigov, yuryeviches, who, controlled, vladimir, suzdal, and, romanoviches, in, galicia, volhynia, the, olgoviches, descended, from, oleg, i, of, chernigov, a, son, of, sviatoslav, ii, of, kiev, and, grandson, of, yaroslav, the, wise, they, continued, to, rule, until, the, early, 14th, century, when, they, were, torn, apart, by, the, emerging, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, and, grand, duchy, of, moscow, the, line, continued, through, oleg, s, son, vsevolod, ii, of, kiev, grandson, sviatoslav, iii, of, kiev, great, grandson, vsevolod, iv, of, kiev, and, great, great, grandson, michael, of, chernigov, from, whose, sons, the, extant, lines, of, the, olegoviches, are, descended, including, the, massalsky, gorchakov, baryatinsky, volkonsky, and, obolensky, including, repnin, vsevolod, i, of, kiev, was, the, father, of, vladimir, ii, monomakh, giving, rise, to, the, name, monomakh, for, his, progeny, two, of, vladimir, ii, s, sons, were, mstislav, i, of, kiev, and, yuri, dolgorukiy, the, romanoviches, izyaslavichi, of, volhynia, were, the, line, of, roman, the, great, descended, from, mstislav, i, of, kiev, through, his, son, iziaslav, ii, of, kiev, and, his, grandson, mstislav, ii, of, kiev, father, of, roman, the, great, the, older, monomakhovychi, line, that, ruled, the, principality, of, volhynia, were, eventually, crowned, kings, of, galicia, and, volhynia, and, ruled, until, 1323, the, romanovychi, displaced, the, older, line, of, izyaslavychi, from, turov, and, volhynia, as, well, as, rostyslavychi, from, galicia, the, last, were, two, brothers, of, romanovychi, andrew, and, lev, ii, who, ruled, jointly, and, were, slain, trying, to, repel, mongol, incursions, the, polish, king, w, adys, aw, i, the, elbow, high, in, his, letter, to, the, pope, wrote, with, regret, the, two, last, ruthenian, kings, that, had, been, firm, shields, for, poland, from, the, tatars, left, this, world, and, after, their, death, poland, is, directly, under, tatar, threat, losing, their, leadership, role, the, rurikids, however, continued, to, play, a, vital, role, in, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, and, the, later, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, most, notably, the, ostrogski, family, held, the, title, of, grand, hetman, of, lithuania, and, strove, to, preserve, the, ruthenian, language, and, eastern, orthodoxy, in, this, part, of, europe, it, is, thought, that, the, drutsk, and, related, princely, families, may, also, descend, from, roman, the, great, the, rostislaviches, were, the, line, of, rostislav, i, of, kiev, another, son, of, mstislav, i, of, kiev, who, was, prince, of, smolensk, and, a, progenitor, of, the, lines, descending, from, the, princes, of, smolensk, and, yaroslavl, the, shakhovskoys, were, founded, by, konstantin, shakh, glebovich, prince, of, yaroslavl, and, traces, its, lineage, to, rostislav, i, of, kiev, through, his, son, davyd, rostislavich, this, branch, also, descends, cognatically, of, ivan, i, of, moscow, through, the, latter, s, daughter, evdokia, ivanovna, moskovskaya, 1314, 1342, who, married, vasili, mikhailovich, prince, of, yaroslavl, died, 1345, they, were, the, great, grandparents, of, andrey, and, yuriy, the, first, shakhovskoy, princes, this, is, possibly, the, most, senior, extant, branch, of, the, rurikids, with, many, shakhovskoys, living, outside, of, russia, after, having, fled, during, the, russian, revolution, the, yuryeviches, were, founded, by, yuriy, dolgorukiy, the, founder, of, moscow, and, spread, vastly, in, the, north, east, yuri, s, son, vsevolod, the, big, nest, was, prince, of, vladimir, suzdal, a, precursor, state, to, the, grand, principality, of, moscow, and, thus, of, the, russian, empire, vsevolod, s, son, konstantin, of, rostov, was, prince, of, rostov, and, the, progenitor, of, various, rostov, princely, lines, another, son, ivan, vsevolodich, was, prince, of, starodub, and, progenitor, of, a, number, of, extant, lines, most, notably, the, gagarin, line, vsevolod, s, son, yaroslav, ii, of, vladimir, was, the, father, of, alexander, nevsky, whose, son, daniel, of, moscow, sired, the, ruling, house, of, moscow, until, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, the, princes, of, moscow, are, often, referred, to, as, the, daniilovichi, beginning, with, the, reign, of, ivan, the, terrible, the, muscovite, branch, used, the, title, tsar, of, all, russia, and, ruled, over, the, tsardom, of, russia, the, death, in, 1598, of, tsar, feodor, i, ended, the, rule, of, the, rurik, dynasty, the, dynasty, was, briefly, revived, in, the, person, of, vasili, iv, of, russia, a, descendant, of, shuyskiy, line, of, the, rurik, dynasty, but, he, died, without, issue, the, unstable, period, known, as, the, time, of, troubles, followed, feodor, s, death, and, lasted, until, 1613, in, that, year, mikhail, i, ascended, the, throne, founding, the, romanov, dynasty, that, would, rule, until, 1762, and, as, holstein, gottorp, romanov, until, the, revolutions, of, 1917, tsar, mikhail, s, father, patriarch, filaret, of, moscow, was, descended, from, the, rurik, dynasty, through, the, female, line, his, mother, evdokiya, gorbataya, shuyskaya, was, a, rurikid, princess, from, the, shuysky, branch, daughter, of, alexander, gorbatyi, shuisky, tsar, mikhail, s, first, wife, maria, dolgorukova, was, of, rurikid, stock, but, their, marriage, produced, no, children, volodimerovichi, grand, princes, of, kiev, russian, and, ukrainian, historians, have, debated, for, many, years, about, the, legacy, of, the, rurikid, dynasty, the, russian, view, sees, the, principality, of, moscow, ruled, by, the, rurikid, dynasty, as, the, sole, heir, to, the, kievan, rus, civilisation, this, view, is, resting, largely, on, religious, ecclesiastical, and, historical, claims, because, eastern, russian, lands, managed, to, establish, themself, as, independent, state, that, was, ruled, by, the, rurikid, dynasty, until, 16th, century, this, view, started, in, moscow, as, ruled, by, the, original, rurikid, dynasty, between, the, 1330s, and, the, late, 1850s, at, the, same, time, ukrainian, view, of, sole, succession, is, based, on, continuity, from, the, kievan, rus, and, its, subsequent, kingdom, of, ruthenia, lithuania, ruthenia, cossack, ukraine, for, that, it, had, utilised, mainly, territorial, ethnodemographic, social, and, institutional, arguments, the, predominant, ukrainian, view, had, gradually, changed, over, time, after, decline, of, kievan, rus, rulers, of, galicia, volhynia, claimed, sole, succession, and, the, title, of, ruler, of, all, former, rus, lands, as, was, noted, in, kievan, and, then, galician, volhynian, chronicles, following, downfall, of, galicia, volhynia, monarchs, of, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, and, ruthenia, and, then, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, claimed, sole, succession, as, well, which, in, turn, was, supported, by, ruthenian, population, and, historians, at, the, time, but, that, view, had, shifted, by, mid, 17th, century, especially, after, pereiaslav, agreement, and, publication, of, kievan, synopsis, in, 1674, that, viewed, people, of, great, russia, little, russia, and, white, russia, as, single, all, russian, nation, under, leadership, of, tsar, though, latter, was, challenged, but, eventually, became, predominantly, accepted, until, history, of, ruthenians, was, written, at, the, break, of, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, underlying, foundation, for, separate, ukrainian, historiography, with, later, monolineal, and, exclusivist, ukrainian, national, theory, being, advanced, by, national, historiography, between, the, 1840s, and, the, end, of, the, 1930s, it, was, summarised, most, clearly, by, mykhailo, hrushevsky, in, his, history, of, ukraine, rus, laying, foundation, for, current, sole, succession, view, during, soviet, times, by, 1930s, prior, all, russian, nation, ideology, was, a, modified, to, allot, equal, rights, to, the, kievan, inheritance, to, the, three, slavic, peoples, that, is, the, russians, the, ukrainians, and, the, belorussians, but, later, elevated, the, russian, nation, as, the, elder, brother, to, give, the, others, needed, guidance, in, revolutionary, struggles, and, socialist, construction, there, are, currently, various, extant, branches, of, the, rurikids, for, instance, the, houses, of, shakhovskoy, gagarin, and, lobanov, rostovsky, their, representatives, include, prince, dmitriy, mikhailovich, shakhovskoy, born, 1934, prince, dmitri, andreevich, gagarin, born, 1934, and, prince, nikita, lobanov, rostovsky, born, 1935, a, descendant, of, prince, konstantin, vasilyevich, of, rostov, the, three, of, them, are, of, the, monomakhovichi, branch, while, the, shakhovskoys, claim, descent, from, mstislav, i, of, kiev, the, gagarins, and, the, lobanov, rostovskys, are, descendants, of, vsevolod, iii, of, vladimir, which, makes, the, shakhovskoys, the, most, senior
