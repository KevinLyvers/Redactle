ltte, fought, to, create, an, independent, tamil, state, called, tamil, eelam, in, the, north, east, of, the, island, due, to, the, continuous, discrimination, and, violent, persecution, against, sri,

the, 1981, burning, of, the, jaffna, public, library, these, were, carried, out, by, the, majority, sinhalese, mobs, often, with, state, support, in, the, years, following, sri, lanka, s, independence, from, the, british, empire, in, 1948, shortly, after, gaining, independence, sinhalese, was, recognized, as, the, sole, official, language, of, the, nation, after, a, 26, year, military, campaign, the, sri, lankan, military, defeated, the, tamil, tigers, in, may, 2009, bringing, the, civil, war, to, an, end, up, to, 70, 000, had, been, killed, by, 2007, immediately, following, the,

civilian, deaths, the, sri, lankan, government, has, repeatedly, refused, an, independent, international, investigation, to, ascertain, the, full, impact, of, the, war, with, some, reports, claiming, that, government, forces, were, raping, and, torturing, tamils, involved, in, collating, deaths, and, disappearances, since, the, end, of, the, civil, war, the, sri, lankan, state, has, been, subject, to, much, global, criticism, for, violating, human, rights, as, a, result, of, committing, war, crimes, through, bombing, civilian, targets, usage, of, heavy, weaponry, the, abduction, and, massacres, of, sri, lankan, tamils, and, sexual, violence, the, ltte, gained, notoriety, for, carrying, out, numerous, attacks, against, civilians, of, all, ethnicities, particularly, those, of, sinhalese, and, sri, lankan, muslim, ethnicity, using, child, soldiers, assassinations, of, politicians, and, dissenters, and, the, use, of, suicide, bombings, against, military, political, and, civilian, targets, the, origins, of, the, sri, lankan, civil, war, lie, in, the, continuous, political, rancor, between, the, majority, sinhalese, and, the, minority, tamils, the, roots, of, the, modern, conflict, extend, back, to, the, colonial, era, when, the, country, was, known, as, ceylon, the, british, colonial, period, lasted, from, 1815, to, 1948, during, which, the, british, sought, monetary, gain, from, sri, lanka, s, supply, of, tea, coffee, coconuts, and, rubber, a, labor, shortage, led, the, british, to, employ, tamils, from, india, to, work, on, tea, plantations, furthering, fears, of, racial, decline, among, the, sinhalese, english, language, schools, were, also, established, in, jaffna, by, the, american, ceylon, mission, which, provided, english, language, skills, for, the, tamil, population, in, jaffna, the, british, favored, english, speakers, so, tamils, outcompeted, their, sinhalese, counterparts, in, the, civil, service, sector, in, 1919, major, sinhalese, and, tamil, political, organizations, united, to, form, the, ceylon, national, congress, under, the, leadership, of, ponnambalam, arunachalam, to, press, the, colonial, government, for, more, constitutional, reforms, british, colonial, administrator, william, manning, actively, encouraged, the, concept, of, communal, representation, and, created, the, colombo, town, seat, in, 1920, which, alternated, between, the, tamils, and, the, sinhalese, after, their, election, to, the, state, council, in, 1936, the, lanka, sama, samaja, party, lssp, members, n, m, perera, and, philip, gunawardena, demanded, the, replacement, of, english, as, the, official, language, by, sinhala, and, tamil, in, november, 1936, a, motion, that, in, the, municipal, and, police, courts, of, the, island, the, proceedings, should, be, in, the, vernacular, and, that, entries, in, police, stations, should, be, recorded, in, the, language, in, which, they, are, originally, stated, were, passed, by, the, state, council, and, referred, to, the, legal, secretary, however, in, 1944, j, r, jayawardena, moved, in, the, state, council, that, sinhala, should, replace, english, as, the, official, language, ethnic, tensions, were, exacerbated, immediately, after, independence, in, 1948, when, a, controversial, law, was, passed, by, the, ceylon, parliament, called, the, ceylon, citizenship, act, which, deliberately, discriminated, against, the, indian, tamil, ethnic, minority, by, making, it, virtually, impossible, for, them, to, obtain, citizenship, in, the, country, approximately, 700, 000, indian, tamils, were, made, stateless, over, the, next, three, decades, more, than, 300, 000, indian, tamils, were, deported, back, to, india, it, wasn, t, until, 2003, 55, years, after, independence, that, all, indian, tamils, living, in, sri, lanka, were, granted, citizenship, but, by, this, time, they, only, made, up, 5, of, the, island, s, population, prior, to, 1950, various, minority, groups, excluding, the, sri, lankan, tamils, had, been, attacked, by, sinhalese, buddhists, these, included, christians, muslims, and, malayalis, the, sri, lankan, tamils, however, had, remained, largely, untouched, early, sinhala, buddhist, propaganda, was, directed, mainly, against, foreign, and, religious, ethnic, minorities, this, changed, in, the, 1950s, as, the, sri, lankan, tamils, were, rediscovered, to, be, the, traditional, enemy, of, the, sinhalese, at, the, time, of, independence, in, 1948, tamils, comprised, around, 30, of, the, higher, ranks, of, civil, service, while, comprising, around, 20, of, the, island, s, population, in, 1956, prime, minister, s, w, r, d, bandaranaike, passed, the, sinhala, only, act, which, replaced, english, with, sinhala, as, the, only, official, language, of, the, country, this, was, seen, as, a, deliberate, attempt, to, discourage, the, sri, lankan, tamils, from, working, in, the, ceylon, civil, service, and, other, public, services, the, tamil, speaking, minorities, of, ceylon, sri, lankan, tamils, indian, tamils, and, sri, lankan, moors, viewed, the, act, as, linguistic, cultural, and, economic, discrimination, against, them, many, tamil, speaking, civil, servants, public, servants, were, forced, to, resign, because, they, weren, t, fluent, in, sinhala, tension, over, this, policy, led, to, the, 1956, anti, tamil, pogrom, and, the, 1958, anti, tamil, pogrom, in, which, sinhalese, mobs, attacked, hundreds, of, tamils, in, sinhalese, majority, areas, sinhalese, in, tamil, majority, areas, were, also, attacked, by, tamil, mobs, dozens, if, not, hundreds, mostly, tamils, perished, while, thousands, of, both, groups, fled, to, areas, where, they, were, in, the, majority, the, civil, war, was, a, direct, result, of, the, escalation, of, the, confrontational, politics, that, followed, in, the, late, 1960s, several, tamil, youth, among, them, velupillai, prabhakaran, also, became, involved, in, these, activities, they, carried, out, several, hit, and, run, operations, against, pro, government, tamil, politicians, sri, lanka, police, and, the, civil, administration, during, the, 1970s, the, policy, of, standardization, was, initiated, under, the, policy, students, were, admitted, to, university, in, proportion, to, the, number, of, applicants, who, sat, for, the, examination, in, their, language, officially, the, policy, was, designed, to, increase, the, representation, of, students, from, rural, areas, in, practice, the, policy, reduced, the, numbers, of, sri, lankan, tamil, students, who, had, previously, based, on, their, examination, scores, alone, gained, admission, in, a, higher, proportion, than, their, participation, in, the, examination, they, were, now, required, to, gain, higher, marks, than, sinhalese, students, to, gain, admission, to, universities, for, instance, the, qualifying, mark, for, admission, to, the, medical, faculties, was, 250, out, of, 400, for, tamil, students, but, only, 229, for, sinhalese, the, number, of, sri, lankan, tamil, students, entering, universities, fell, dramatically, the, policy, was, abandoned, in, 1977, other, forms, of, official, discrimination, against, the, sri, lankan, tamils, included, the, state, sponsored, colonization, of, traditional, tamil, areas, by, sinhalese, peasants, the, banning, of, the, import, of, tamil, language, media, and, the, preference, given, by, the, 1978, constitution, of, sri, lanka, to, buddhism, the, main, religion, followed, by, the, sinhalese, prabhakaran, formed, the, tamil, new, tigers, tnt, in, 1972, the, formation, of, the, tamil, united, liberation, front, tulf, with, the, vaddukkodei, vattukottai, resolution, of, 1976, led, to, a, hardening, of, attitudes, the, resolution, called, for, the, creation, of, a, secular, socialist, state, of, tamil, eelam, based, on, the, right, of, self, determination, the, tulf, clandestinely, supported, the, armed, actions, of, the, young, militants, who, were, dubbed, our, boys, tulf, leader, appapillai, amirthalingam, even, provided, letters, of, reference, to, the, ltte, and, to, other, tamil, insurgent, groups, to,

well, as, its, offshoot, the, tulf, deeply, conservative, and, dominated, by, vellalar, casteism, did, not, attempt, to, form, a, national, alliance, with, the, leftists, in, their, fight, for, language, rights, following, the, sweeping, electoral, victory, of, the, united, national, party, unp, in, july, 1977, the, tulf, became, the, leading, opposition, party, with, around, one, sixth, of,

population, it, lifted, the, policy, of, standardization, for, university, admission, that, had, driven, many, tamil, youths, into, militancy, the, concession, was, regarded, by, the, militants, as, too, little, too, late, and, violent, attacks, continued, by, this, time, tulf, started, losing, its, grip, over, the, militant, groups, ltte, ordered, civilians, to, boycott, the, local, government, elections, of, 1983, in, which, even, tulf, contested, voter, turnout, was, as, low, as, 10, thereafter, tamil, political, parties, were, unable, to, represent, the, interests, of, the, tamil,

independently, of, the, colombo, tamil, leadership, and, in, the, end, rejected, and, annihilated, them, the, most, prominent, of, these, groups, was, the, tnt, which, changed, its, name, to, the, liberation, tigers, of, tamil, eelam, or, the, ltte, in, 1976, the, ltte, initially, carried, out, a, campaign, of, violence, against, the, state, particularly, targeting, policemen, and, also,

internally, displaced, persons, living, in, camps, homeless, and, struggling, for, survival, as, a, result, a, significant, peace, movement, developed, in, the, late, 1990s, with, many, organizations, holding, peace, camps, conferences, training, and, peace, meditations, and, many, other, efforts, to, bridge, the, two, sides, at, all, levels, as, early, as, february, 2000, norway, was, asked, to,

for, the, first, and, only, time, since, its, independence, towards, the, end, of, 2001, however, the, ltte, began, to, declare, their, willingness, to, explore, measures, for, a, peaceful, settlement, to, the, conflict, one, reason, for, this, action, may, have, been, the, fear, of, international, pressure, and, the, direct, us, support, of, the, sri, lankan, government, as, part, of, the, war, on, terror, on, the, other, hand, the, covert, operations, of, the, long, range, reconnaissance, patrol, lrrp, of, sri, lanka, army, had, a, profound, impact, on, the, tiger, command, structure, during, this, period, vaithilingam, sornalingam, alias, shankar, who, had, been, considered, the, right, hand, man, of, ltte, leader, prabhakaran, and, several, other, high, profile, leaders, were, hunted, down, and, killed, by, lrrp, units, in, the, south, the, government, was, facing, increasing, criticism, over, its, war, for, peace, strategy, with, peace, nowhere, in, sight, and, the, economy, in, tatters, after, losing, a, no, confidence, motion, president, kumaratunga, was, forced, to, dissolve, parliament, and, call, for, fresh, elections, the, elections, held, on, 5, december, 2001, saw, a, sweeping, victory, for, the, united, national, front, led, by, ranil, wickremasinghe, who, campaigned, on, a, pro, peace, platform, and, pledged, to, find, a, negotiated, settlement, to, the, conflict, on, 19, december, amidst, efforts, by, norway, to, bring, the, government, and, the, tamil, tigers, to, the, negotiating, table, the, ltte, announced, a, 30, day, cease, fire, with, the, sri, lankan, government, and, pledged, to, halt, all, attacks, against, government, forces, the, new, government, welcomed, the, move, and, reciprocated, it, two, days, later, announcing, a, month, long, cease, fire, and, agreeing, to, lift, a, long, standing, economic, embargo, on, rebel, held, territory, the, cease, fire, was, by, no, means, acceptable, to, everyone, buddhist, monks, started, burning, norwegian, flags, and, agitated, against, the, cease, fire, and, eventually, went, to, form, a, political, party, jathika, hela, urumaya, with, extremist, views, the, two, sides, formalized, a, memorandum, of, understanding, mou, on, 22, february, 2002, and, signed, a, permanent, cease, fire, agreement, cfa, norway, was, named, mediator, and, it, was, decided, that, they, together, with, the, other, nordic, countries, monitor, the, cease, fire, through, a, committee, of, experts, named, the, sri, lanka, monitoring, mission, in, august, the, government, agreed, to, lift, the, ban, on, the, ltte, and, paved, the, way, for, the, resumption, of, direct, negotiations, with, them, following, the, signing, of, the, ceasefire, agreement, commercial, air, flights, to, jaffna, began, and, the, ltte, opened, the, key, a9, highway, which, linked, the, government, controlled, area, in, the, south, with, jaffna, and, ran, through, ltte, territory, allowing, civilian, traffic, through, the, vanni, region, for, the, first, time, in, many, years, but, only, after, paying, a, tax, to, the, ltte, many, foreign, countries, also, offered, substantial, financial, support, if, peace, was, achieved, and, optimism, grew, that, an, end, to, the, decades, long, conflict, was, in, sight, the, much, anticipated, peace, talks, began, in, phuket, thailand, and, further, rounds, followed, in, thailand, norway, germany, and, japan, during, the, talks, both, sides, agreed, to, the, principle, of, a, federal, solution, and, the, tigers, dropped, their, long, standing, demand, for, a, separate, state, this, was, a, major, compromise, on, the, part, of, the, ltte, which, had, always, insisted, on, an, independent, tamil, state, this, also, represented, a, compromise, on, the, part, of, the, government, which, had, seldom, agreed, to, more, than, minimal, devolution, both, sides, also, exchanged, prisoners, of, war, for, the, first, time, following, the, elections, of, 2001, for, the, first, time, in, sri, lanka, s, history, the, president, and, prime, minister, were, of, two, different, parties, this, co, habitation, was, uneasy, especially, since, prime, minister, wickremasinghe, and, the, unp, favored, a, federal, solution, to, the, conflict, while, hard, line, elements, within, president, kumaratunga, s, party, and, other, sinhala, nationalist, groups, allied, to, her, opposed, one, as, they, did, not, trust, the, ltte, which, continued, to, levy, taxes, strengthen, itself, by, smuggling, in, arms, and, ammunition, recruit, child, soldiers, and, engage, in, killings, of, members, of, rival, tamil, groups, and, government, intelligence, agents, following, the, millennium, city, incident, during, this, time, the, ltte, also, succeeded, in, setting, up, a, series, of, vital, bases, around, the, trincomalee, harbour, i, e, manirasakulam, camp, and, the, eastern, province, the, talks, broke, down, on, 21, april, 2003, when, the, tamil, tigers, announced, they, were, suspending, any, further, talks, due, to, their, displeasure, at, the, handling, of, some, critical, issues, among, the, reasons, the, tigers, gave, were, their, exclusion, from, reconstruction, talks, in, washington, dc, on, 14, april, and, a, more, general, insinuation, that, they, were, not, receiving, the, full, economic, rewards, of, peace, they, cited, the, failure, as, they, saw, it, of, peace, dividends, to, transfer, to, security, withdrawals, on, the, ground, and, the, disparity, as, they, saw, it, between, the, relative, calm, of, the, government, held, northeast, and, continuing, violence, in, tiger, held, areas, however, the, ltte, maintained, it, was, committed, to, a, settlement, to, the, two, decade, conflict, but, stated, that, progress, had, to, be, made, on, the, ground, before, the, settlement, proceeded, on, 31, october, the, ltte, issued, its, own, peace, proposal, calling, for, an, interim, self, governing, authority, isga, the, isga, would, be, fully, controlled, by, the, ltte, and, would, have, broad, powers, in, the, north, and, east, see, the, full, text, of, the, proposals, this, provoked, a, strong, backlash, among, the, hard, line, elements, in, the, south, who, accused, prime, minister, wickremasinghe, of, handing, the, north, and, east, to, the, ltte, under, pressure, from, within, her, own, party, to, take, action, kumaratunga, declared, a, state, of, emergency, and, took, three, key, government, ministries, the, ministry, of, mass, media, the, interior, ministry, and, the, crucial, defense, ministry, she, then, formed, an, alliance, with, the, jvp, called, the, united, people, s, freedom, alliance, opposed, to, the, isga, and, advocating, a, harder, line, on, the, ltte, and, called, for, fresh, elections, the, elections, held, on, 8, april, 2004, resulted, in, victory, for, the, upfa, with, mahinda, rajapakse, appointed, as, prime, minister, meanwhile, in, march, 2004, there, had, been, a, major, split, between, the, northern, and, eastern, wings, of, the, ltte, vinayagamoorthy, muralitharan, alias, col, karuna, the, eastern, commander, of, the, ltte, and, one, of, prabhakaran, s, trusted, lieutenants, pulled, 5, 000, eastern, cadres, out, of, the, ltte, claiming, insufficient, resources, and, power, were, being, given, to, tamils, of, the, eastern, part, of, the, island, it, was, the, biggest, expression, of, dissension, in, the, history, of, the, ltte, and, a, clash, within, the, ltte, seemed, imminent, after, the, parliamentary, elections, brief, fighting, south, of, trincomalee, led, to, a, rapid, retreat, and, capitulation, of, karuna, s, group, their, leaders, eventually, going, into, hiding, including, karuna, himself, who, was, helped, to, escape, by, seyed, ali, zahir, moulana, a, politician, from, the, ruling, party, however, the, karuna, faction, maintained, a, significant, presence, in, the, east, and, continued, to, launch, attacks, against, the, ltte, the, ltte, accused, the, army, of, covertly, backing, the, breakaway, group, which, subsequently, formed, a, political, party, named, the, tamileela, makkal, viduthalai, pulikal, tmvp, and, hope, to, contest, in, future, elections, the, cease, fire, largely, held, through, all, this, turmoil, with, over, 3000, infractions, by, the, ltte, and, some, 300, by, the, sla, recorded, by, the, sri, lanka, monitoring, mission, slmm, by, 2005, the, situation, was, further, complicated, by, allegations, that, both, sides, were, carrying, out, covert, operations, against, each, other, the, government, claimed, that, the, ltte, was, killing, political, opponents, recruiting, children, importing, arms, and, killing, government, security, and, intelligence, officers, the, rebels, accused, the, government, of, supporting, paramilitary, groups, against, them, especially, the, karuna, group, on, 26, december, 2004, the, indian, ocean, tsunami, struck, sri, lanka, killing, more, than, 35, 000, people, and, leaving, many, more, homeless, a, great, deal, of, aid, arrived, from, around, the, world, but, there, was, immediate, disagreement, over, how, it, should, be, distributed, to, the, tamil, regions, under, ltte, control, by, 24, june, the, government, and, ltte, agreed, on, the, post, tsunami, operational, management, structure, p, toms, but, it, received, sharp, criticism, from, the, jvp, who, left, the, government, in, protest, the, legality, of, p, toms, was, also, challenged, in, the, courts, president, kumaratunga, eventually, had, to, scrap, p, toms, which, led, to, widespread, criticism, that, sufficient, aid, was, not, reaching, the, north, and, east, of, the, country, however, immediately, following, the, tsunami, there, was, a, marked, decrease, in, violence, in, the, north, sri, lankan, foreign, minister, lakshman, kadirgamar, a, tamil, who, was, highly, respected, by, foreign, diplomats, and, who, had, been, sharply, critical, of, the, ltte, was, assassinated, at, his, home, on, 12, august, 2005, allegedly, by, a, ltte, sniper, his, assassination, led, to, the, marginalization, of, the, ltte, in, the, international, community, and, is, generally, considered, to, be, the, moment, when, the, ltte, lost, much, of, the, sympathy, in, the, eyes, of, foreign, nations, the, result, was, silence, of, the, international, community, when, the, sri, lankan, government, took, military, action, against, the, ltte, in, 2006, when, the, latter, closed, the, mavil, aru, sluice, further, political, change, occurred, when, the, supreme, court, of, sri, lanka, declared, president, kumaratunga, s, second, and, final, term, over, and, ordered, her, to, hold, fresh, presidential, elections, the, main, candidates, for, the, election, which, was, held, in, november, were, unf, candidate, former, prime, minister, ranil, wickremasinghe, who, advocated, the, reopening, of, talks, with, the, ltte, and, the, upfa, candidate, prime, minister, rajapaksa, who, called, for, a, tougher, line, against, the, ltte, and, a, renegotiation, of, the, cease, fire, the, ltte, openly, called, for, a, boycott, of, the, election, by, tamils, many, of, them, were, expected, to, vote, for, wickremasinghe, and, the, loss, of, their, votes, proved, fatal, to, his, chances, as, rajapakse, achieved, a, narrow, victory, following, the, election, ltte, leader, velupillai, prabhakaran, stated, in, his, annual, address, that, the, tigers, would, renew, their, struggle, in, 2006, if, the, government, did, not, take, serious, moves, toward, peace, beginning, in, december, 2005, there, was, increased, guerrilla, activity, to, the, northeast, including, claymore, mine, attacks, which, killed, 150, government,

crisis, leading, to, the, first, large, scale, fighting, since, signing, of, the, cease, fire, occurred, when, the, ltte, closed, the, sluice, gates, of, the, mavil, aru, reservoir, on, 21, july,

the, ltte, claimed, that, it, opened, the, sluice, gates, on, humanitarian, grounds, although, this, was, disputed, by, military, correspondents, who, stated, the, water, began, flowing, immediately,
