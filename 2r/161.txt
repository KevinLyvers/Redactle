1600, bc, from, the, 15th, century, bc, onward, the, term, amurru, is, usually, applied, to, the, region, extending, north, of, canaan, as, far, as, kadesh, on, the, orontes, river, in, northern, syria, after, the, mid, 2nd, millennium, bc, syrian, amorites, came, under, the, domination, of, first, the, hittites, and, from, the, 14th, century, bc, the, middle, assyrian, empire, they, then, appear, to, have, been, displaced, or, absorbed, by, other, semi, nomadic, west, semitic, speaking, peoples, known, collectively, as, the, ahlamu, during, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, the, arameans, rose, to, be, the, prominent, group, amongst, the, ahlamu, from, c, 1200, bc, onward, the, amorites, disappeared, from, the, pages, of, history, but, the, name, reappeared, in, the, hebrew, bible, the, language, was, first, attested, in, the, 21st, 20th, centuries, bc, and, was, found, to, be, closely, related, to, the, canaanite, aramaic, and, sam, alian, languages, in, the, 18th, century, bc, at, mari, amorite, scribes, wrote, in, an, eshnunna, dialect, of, east, semitic, akkadian, language, since, the, texts, contain, northwest, semitic, forms, words, and, constructions, the, amorite, language, is, thought, to, be, a, northwest, semitic, language, the, main, sources, for, the, extremely, limited, extant, knowledge, of, the, amorite, language, are, the, proper, names, and, loanwords, not, akkadian, in, style, that, are, preserved, in, such, texts, amorite, proper, names, were, found, throughout, mesopotamia, in, the, old, babylonian, period, as, well, as, places, as, far, afield, as, alalakh, in, turkey, and, modern, day, bahrain, dilmun, they, are, also, found, in, egyptian, records, ugaritic, is, also, a, northwest, semitic, language, and, is, possibly, an, amorite, dialect, a, bilingual, list, of, the, names, of, ten, amorite, deities, alongside, akkadian, counterparts, from, the, old, babylonian, period, was, translated, in, 2022, these, deities, are, as, follows, 118, 119, this, list, is, not, thought, to, represent, a, full, amorite, pantheon, as, it, does, not, include, important, members, such, as, the, sun, and, weather, deities, 139, the, term, amorites, is, used, in, the, bible, to, refers, to, certain, highlanders, who, inhabited, the, land, of, canaan, described, in, genesis, as, descendants, of, canaan, the, son, of, ham, gen, 10, 16, this, aligns, with, akkadian, and, babylonian, traditions, that, equate, syro, palestine, with, the, land, of, the, amorites, they, are, described, as, a, powerful, people, of, great, stature, like, the, height, of, the, cedars, amos, 2, 9, who, had, occupied, the, land, east, and, west, of, the, jordan, the, height, and, strength, mentioned, in, amos, 2, 9, has, led, some, christian, scholars, including, orville, j, nave, who, wrote, the, nave, s, topical, bible, to, refer, to, the, amorites, as, giants, in, deuteronomy, the, amorite, king, og, is, described, as, the, last, of, the, remnant, of, the, rephaim, deut, 3, 11, the, terms, amorite, and, canaanite, seem, to, be, used, more, or, less, interchangeably, but, sometimes, amorite, refers, to, a, specific, tribe, living, in, canaan, the, biblical, amorites, seem, to, have, originally, occupied, the, region, stretching, from, the, heights, west, of, the, dead, sea, gen, 14, 7, to, hebron, gen, 13, 8, deut, 3, 8, 4, 46, 48, embracing, all, gilead, and, all, bashan, deut, 3, 10, with, the, jordan, valley, on, the, east, of, the, river, deut, 4, 49, the, land, of, the, two, kings, of, the, amorites, sihon, and, og, deut, 31, 4, and, joshua, 2, 10, 9, 10, sihon, and, og, were, independent, kings, whose, people, were, displaced, from, their, land, in, battle, with, the, israelites, numbers, 21, 21, 35, though, in, the, case, of, the, war, led, by, og, bashan, it, appears, none, of, them, survived, and, the, land, became, part, of, israel, numbers, 21, 35, the, amorites, seem, to, have, been, linked, to, the, jerusalem, region, and, the, jebusites, may, have, been, a, subgroup, of, them, ezek, 16, 3, the, southern, slopes, of, the, mountains, of, judea, are, called, the, mount, of, the, amorites, deut, 1, 7, 19, 20, the, book, of, joshua, states, the, five, kings, of, the, amorites, were, first, defeated, with, great, slaughter, by, joshua, josh, 10, 5, then, more, amorite, kings, were, defeated, at, the, waters, of, merom, by, joshua, josh, 11, 8, it, is, mentioned, that, in, the, days, of, samuel, there, was, peace, between, them, and, the, israelites, 1, sam, 7, 14, the, gibeonites, were, said, to, be, their, descendants, being, an, offshoot, of, the, amorites, who, made, a, covenant, with, the, hebrews, 2, samuel, 21, 2, when, saul, later, broke, that, vow, and, killed, some, of, the, gibeonites, god, is, said, to, have, sent, a, famine, to, israel, 2, samuel, 21, 1, in, 2017, philippe, bohstrom, of, haaretz, observed, similarities, between, the, amorites, and, the, jews, since, both, historically, existed, as, well, connected, diasporic, communities, he, also, believes, that, abraham, was, among, the, amorites, who, migrated, to, the, levant, around, the, same, time, that, the, amorites, conquered, ur, at, 1750, bc, due, to, his, north, syrian, heritage, and, shepherding, based, lifestyles, nonetheless, the, biblical, authors, only, applied, the, amorite, ethnonym, to, the, pre, israelite, inhabitants, of, the, high, mountains, reasons, include, the, polemical, need, to, associate, them, with, the, barbaric, raw, meat, eating, amorites, that, the, sumerians, imagined, them, as, the, authors, also, wanted, to, portray, these, inhabitants, as, having, an, ancient, history, there, are, a, wide, range, of, views, regarding, the, amorite, homeland, one, extreme, is, the, view, that, kur, mar, tu, m, t, amurrim, covered, the, whole, area, between, the, euphrates, and, the, mediterranean, sea, the, arabian, peninsula, included, the, most, common, view, is, that, the, homeland, of, the, amorites, was, a, limited, area, in, central, syria, identified, with, the, mountainous, region, of, jebel, bishri, the, amorites, are, regarded, as, one, of, the, ancient, semitic, speaking, peoples, ancient, dna, analysis, on, 28, human, remains, dating, to, the, middle, and, late, bronze, age, from, ancient, alalakh, an, amorite, city, with, a, hurrian, minority, found, that, the, inhabitants, of, alalakh, were, a, mixture, of, copper, age, levantines, and, mesopotamians, and, were, genetically, similar, to, contemporaneous, levantines, the, view, that, amorites, were, fierce, and, tall, nomads, led, to, an, anachronistic, theory, among, some, racialist, writers, in, the, 19th, century, that, they, were, a, tribe, of, aryan, warriors, who, at, one, point, dominated, the, israelites, this, belief, which, originated, with, felix, von, luschan, fit, models, of, indo, european, migrations, posited, during, his, time, but, luschan, later, abandoned, that, theory, houston, stewart, chamberlain, claims, that, king, david, and, jesus, were, both, aryans, of, amorite, extraction, the, argument, was, repeated, by, the, nazi, ideologue,
