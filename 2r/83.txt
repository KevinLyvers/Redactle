the, latium, to, the, dominant, force, in, italy, and, beyond, the, unification, of, italy, by, the, romans, was, a, gradual, process, brought, about, by, a, series, of, conflicts, of, the, 4th, and,

bc, followed, by, the, acquisition, of, greece, and, asia, minor, this, tremendous, increase, of, power, was, accompanied, by, economic, instability, and, social, unrest, resulting, in, the, catiline, conspiracy, the, social, war, and, the, first, triumvirate, and, finally, the, transformation, to, the, roman, empire, during, the, latter, half, of, the, 1st, century, bc, the, precise, end, of, the, republic, is, disputed, by, modern, historians, roman, citizens, of, the, time, did, not, recognize, that, the, republic, had, ceased, to, exist, the, early, julio, claudian, emperors, maintained, that, the, res, publica, still, existed, albeit, protected, by, their, extraordinary, powers, and, would, eventually, return, to, its, earlier, republican, form, the, roman, state, continued, to, term, itself, a, res, publica, as, long, as, it, continued, to, use, latin, as, its, official, language, rome, acquired, imperial, character, de, facto, from, the, 130s, bc, with, the, acquisition, of, cisalpine, gaul, illyria, greece, and, hispania, and, definitely, with, the, addition, of, iudaea, asia, minor, and, gaul, during, the, 1st, century, bc, at, the, time, of, the, empire, s,

notably, christianity, classical, rome, had, vast, differences, within, their, family, life, compared, to, the, greeks, fathers, had, great, power, over, their, children, and, husbands, over, their, wives, in, fact, the, word, family, familia, in, latin, actually, referred, to, those, who, were, subject, to, the, authority, of, a, male, head, of, household, this, included, non, related, members,

the, roman, empire, began, to, weaken, as, a, result, of, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, during, late, antiquity, christianity, became, increasingly, popular, finally, ousting, the, roman, imperial, cult, with, the, theodosian, decrees, of, 393, successive, invasions, of, germanic, tribes, finalized, the, weakening, of, the, western, roman, empire, during, the, 5th, century, while, the, eastern, roman, empire, persisted, throughout, the, middle, ages, in, a, state, called, romania, by, its, citizens, and, designated, the, byzantine, empire, by, later, historians, hellenistic, philosophy, was, succeeded, by, continued, development, of, platonism, and, epicureanism, with, neoplatonism, in, due, course, influencing, the, theology, of, the, christian, church, fathers, many, writers, have, attempted, to, name, a, specific, date, for, the, symbolic, end, of, antiquity, with, the, most, prominent, dates, being, the, deposing, of, the, last, western, roman, emperor, in, 476, the, closing, of, the, last, platonic, academy, in, athens, by, the, eastern, roman, emperor, justinian, i, in, 529, and, the, conquest, of, much, of, the, mediterranean, by, the, new, muslim, faith,

the, sieges, of, the, eastern, roman, capital, first, in, 674, 78, and, then, in, 717, 18, severed, the, economic, cultural, and, political, links, that, had, traditionally, united, the, classical, cultures, around, the, mediterranean, ending, antiquity, see, pirenne, thesis, the, original, roman, senate, continued, to, express, decrees, into, the, late, 6th, century, and, the, last, eastern,

commanded, by, phocas, resulted, in, the, slavic, invasion, of, the, balkans, and, the, weakening, of, balkan, and, greek, urban, culture, resulting, in, the, flight, of, balkan, latin, speakers, to, the, mountains, see, origin, of, the, romanians, and, also, provoked, the, byzantine, sasanian, war, of, 602, 628, in, which, all, the, great, eastern, cities, except, constantinople, were, lost, the, resulting, turmoil, did, not, end, until, the, muslim, conquests, of, the, 7th, century, finalized, the, irreversible, loss, of, all, the, largest, eastern, roman, imperial, cities, besides, the, capital, itself, the, emperor, heraclius, in, constantinople, who, reigned, during, this, period, conducted, his, court, in, greek, not, latin, though, greek, had, always, been, an, administrative,

remained, the, only, unconquered, large, urban, site, of, the, original, roman, empire, as, well, as, being, the, largest, city, in, europe, yet, many, classical, books, sculptures, and, technologies, survived, there, along, with, classical, roman, cuisine, and, scholarly, traditions, well, into, the, middle, ages, when, much, of, it, was, rediscovered, by, visiting, western, crusaders, indeed,

scholars, in, the, renaissance, ultimately, it, was, a, slow, complex, and, graduated, change, of, the, socio, economic, structure, in, european, history, that, resulted, in, the, changeover, between, classical, antiquity, and, medieval, society, and, no, specific, date, can, truly, exemplify, that, in, politics, the, late, roman, conception, of, the, empire, as, a, universal, state, commanded, by, one, supreme, divinely, appointed, ruler, united, with, christianity, as, a, universal, religion, likewise, headed, by, a, supreme, patriarch, proved, very, influential, even, after, the, disappearance, of, imperial, authority, in, the, west, this, tendency, reached, its, maximum, when, charlemagne, was, crowned, roman, emperor, in, the, year, 800, an, act, which, resulted, in, the, formation, of, the, holy, roman, empire, the, notion, that, an, emperor, is, a, monarch, who, outranks, a, king, dates, from, this, period, in, this, political, ideal, there, would, always, be, a, roman, empire, a, state, the, jurisdiction, of, which, extended, through, the, entire, civilized, western, world, that, model, continued, to, exist, in, constantinople, for, the, entirety, of, the,

champion, of, orthodoxy, moscow, was, described, as, the, third, rome, and, the, czars, ruled, as, divinely, appointed, emperors, into, the, 20th, century, despite, the, fact, that, the, western, roman, secular, authority, disappeared, entirely, in, europe, it, still, left, traces, the, papacy, and, the, catholic, church, in, particular, maintained, latin, language, culture, and, literacy,

until, 1806, the, renaissance, idea, that, the, classical, roman, virtues, had, been, lost, as, a, result, of, medievalism, was, especially, powerful, in, european, politics, of, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, reverence, for, roman, republicanism, was, strong, among, the, founding, fathers, of, the, united, states, and, the, latin, american, revolutionaries, the, americans, described, their, new, government, as, a, republic, from, res, publica, and, gave, it, a, senate, and, a, president, another, latin, term, rather, than, use, available, english, terms, like, commonwealth, or, parliament, similarly, in, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, france, republicanism, and, roman, martial, virtues, were, promoted, by, the, state, as, can, be, seen, in, the, architecture, of, the, panth, on, the,
