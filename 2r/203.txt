https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huns
the, huns, were, a, nomadic, people, who, lived, in, central, asia, the, caucasus, and, eastern, europe, between, the, 4th, and, 6th, centuries, ad, according, to, european, tradition, they, were, first, reported, living, east, of, the, volga, river, in, an, area, that, was, part, of, scythia, at, the, time, by, 370, ad, the, huns, had, arrived, on, the, volga, causing, the, westwards, movement, of, goths, and, alans, by, 430, they, had, established, a, vast, but, short, lived, empire, on, the, danubian, frontier, of, the, roman, empire, in, europe, either, under, hunnic, hegemony, or, fleeing, from, it, several, central, and, eastern, european, peoples, established, kingdoms, in, the, region, including, not, only, goths, and, alans, but, also, vandals, gepids, heruli, suebians, and, rugians, the, huns, especially, under, their, king, attila, made, frequent, and, devastating, raids, into, the, eastern, roman, empire, in, 451, they, invaded, the, western, roman, province, of, gaul, where, they, fought, a, combined, army, of, romans, and, visigoths, at, the, battle, of, the, catalaunian, fields, and, in, 452, they, invaded, italy, after, the, death, of, attila, in, 453, the, huns, ceased, to, be, a, major, threat, to, rome, and, lost, much, of, their, empire, following, the, battle, of, nedao, c, 454, descendants, of, the, huns, or, successors, with, similar, names, are, recorded, by, neighboring, populations, to, the, south, east, and, west, as, having, occupied, parts, of, eastern, europe, and, central, asia, from, about, the, 4th, to, 6th, centuries, variants, of, the, hun, name, are, recorded, in, the, caucasus, until, the, early, 8th, century, in, the, 18th, century, french, scholar, joseph, de, guignes, became, the, first, to, propose, a, link, between, the, huns, and, the, xiongnu, people, who, lived, in, northern, china, from, the, 3rd, century, bc, to, the, late, 1st, century, ad, since, guignes, s, time, considerable, scholarly, effort, has, been, devoted, to, investigating, such, a, connection, the, issue, remains, controversial, but, recent, archaeogenetic, studies, show, some, hun, era, individuals, to, have, dna, similar, to, populations, in, ancient, mongolia, their, relationships, with, other, entities, such, as, the, iranian, huns, and, the, huna, people, of, south, asia, have, also, been, disputed, very, little, is, known, about, hunnic, culture, and, very, few, archaeological, remains, have, been, conclusively, associated, with, the, huns, they, are, believed, to, have, used, bronze, cauldrons, and, to, have, performed, artificial, cranial, deformation, no, description, exists, of, the, hunnic, religion, of, the, time, of, attila, but, practices, such, as, divination, are, attested, and, the, existence, of, shamans, is, likely, it, is, also, known, that, the, huns, had, a, language, of, their, own, however, only, three, words, and, personal, names, attest, to, it, economically, the, huns, are, known, to, have, practiced, a, form, of, nomadic, pastoralism, as, their, contact, with, the, roman, world, grew, their, economy, became, increasingly, tied, with, rome, through, tribute, raiding, and, trade, they, do, not, seem, to, have, had, a, unified, government, when, they, entered, europe, but, rather, to, have, developed, a, unified, tribal, leadership, in, the, course, of, their, wars, with, the, romans, the, huns, ruled, over, a, variety, of, peoples, who, spoke, numerous, languages, and, some, maintained, their, own, rulers, their, main, military, technique, was, mounted, archery, the, huns, may, have, stimulated, the, great, migration, a, contributing, factor, in, the, collapse, of, the, western, roman, empire, the, memory, of, the, huns, also, lived, on, in, various, christian, saints, lives, where, the, huns, play, the, roles, of, antagonists, as, well, as, in, germanic, heroic, legend, where, the, huns, are, variously, antagonists, or, allies, to, the, germanic, main, figures, in, hungary, a, legend, developed, based, on, medieval, chronicles, that, the, hungarians, and, the, sz, kely, ethnic, group, in, particular, are, descended, from, the, huns, however, mainstream, scholarship, dismisses, a, close, connection, between, the, hungarians, and, huns, modern, culture, generally, associates, the, huns, with, extreme, cruelty, and, barbarism, the, origins, of, the, huns, and, their, links, to, other, steppe, people, remain, uncertain, scholars, generally, agree, that, they, originated, in, central, asia, but, disagree, on, the, specifics, of, their, origins, classical, sources, assert, that, they, appeared, in, europe, suddenly, around, 370, most, typically, roman, writers, attempts, to, elucidate, the, origins, of, the, huns, simply, equated, them, with, earlier, steppe, peoples, roman, writers, repeated, a, tale, that, the, huns, had, entered, the, domain, of, the, goths, while, they, were, pursuing, a, wild, stag, or, else, one, of, their, cows, that, had, escaped, across, the, kerch, strait, into, crimea, discovering, the, land, fertile, they, then, attacked, the, goths, jordanes, getica, relates, that, the, goths, held, the, huns, to, be, offspring, of, unclean, spirits, and, gothic, witches, getica, 24, 121, since, joseph, de, guignes, in, the, 18th, century, modern, historians, have, associated, the, huns, who, appeared, on, the, borders, of, europe, in, the, 4th, century, ad, with, the, xiongnu, who, had, invaded, numerous, central, plain, polities, from, the, mongolian, plateau, between, the, 3rd, century, bc, and, the, 2nd, century, ad, after, the, devastating, defeat, by, the, han, dynasty, the, northern, branch, of, the, xiongnu, retreated, north, westward, their, descendants, may, have, migrated, through, the, eurasian, steppe, and, consequently, they, may, have, some, degree, of, cultural, and, genetic, continuity, with, the, huns, scholars, also, discussed, the, relationship, between, the, xiongnu, the, huns, and, a, number, of, people, in, central, asia, who, were, also, known, as, or, came, to, be, identified, with, the, name, hun, or, iranian, huns, the, most, prominent, of, these, were, chionites, the, kidarites, and, the, hephthalites, otto, j, maenchen, helfen, was, the, first, to, challenge, the, traditional, approach, based, primarily, on, the, study, of, written, sources, and, to, emphasize, the, importance, of, archaeological, research, since, maenchen, helfen, s, work, the, identification, of, the, xiongnu, as, the, huns, ancestors, has, become, controversial, additionally, several, scholars, have, questioned, the, identification, of, the, iranian, huns, with, the, european, huns, walter, pohl, cautions, that, none, of, the, great, confederations, of, steppe, warriors, was, ethnically, homogenous, and, the, same, name, was, used, by, different, groups, for, reasons, of, prestige, or, by, outsiders, to, describe, their, lifestyle, or, geographic, origin, it, is, therefore, futile, to, speculate, about, identity, or, blood, relationships, between, h, s, iung, nu, hephthalites, and, attila, s, huns, for, instance, all, we, can, safely, say, is, that, the, name, huns, in, late, antiquity, described, prestigious, ruling, groups, of, steppe, warriors, today, there, is, no, general, consensus, and, scholarship, is, divided, on, the, issue, of, a, hun, xiongnu, connection, recent, supporters, of, a, connection, between, the, huns, and, xiongnu, include, hyun, jin, kim, and, etienne, de, la, vaissi, re, de, la, vaissi, re, argues, that, ancient, chinese, and, indian, sources, used, xiongnu, and, hun, to, translate, each, other, and, that, the, various, iranian, huns, were, similarly, identified, with, the, xiongnu, kim, believes, that, the, term, hun, was, not, primarily, an, ethnic, group, but, a, political, category, and, argues, for, a, fundamental, political, and, cultural, continuity, between, the, xiongnu, and, the, european, huns, as, well, as, between, the, xiongnu, and, the, iranian, huns, the, name, hun, is, attested, in, classical, european, sources, as, greek, ounnoi, and, latin, hunni, or, chuni, john, malalas, records, their, name, as, ounna, another, possible, greek, variant, may, be, khounoi, although, this, group, s, identification, with, the, huns, is, disputed, classical, sources, also, frequently, use, the, names, of, older, and, unrelated, steppe, nomads, instead, of, the, name, hun, calling, them, massagetae, scythians, and, cimmerians, among, other, names, the, etymology, of, hun, is, unclear, various, proposed, etymologies, generally, assume, at, least, that, the, names, of, the, various, eurasian, groups, known, as, huns, are, related, there, have, been, a, number, of, proposed, turkic, etymologies, deriving, the, name, variously, from, turkic, n, na, to, grow, qun, glutton, k, n, g, n, a, plural, suffix, supposedly, meaning, people, qun, force, and, h, n, ferocious, maenchen, helfen, dismisses, all, of, these, turkic, etymologies, as, mere, guesses, and, proposes, an, iranian, etymology, from, a, word, akin, to, avestan, h, nar, skill, h, naravant, skillful, he, suggests, that, it, may, originally, have, designated, a, rank, rather, than, an, ethnicity, robert, werner, has, advanced, an, etymology, from, tocharian, ku, dog, suggesting, as, the, chinese, called, the, xiongnu, dogs, that, the, dog, was, the, totem, animal, of, the, hunnic, tribe, he, also, compares, the, name, massagetae, noting, that, the, element, saka, in, that, name, means, dog, others, such, as, harold, bailey, s, parlato, and, jamsheed, choksy, have, argued, that, the, name, derives, from, an, iranian, word, akin, to, avestan, yaona, and, was, a, generalized, term, meaning, hostiles, opponents, christopher, atwood, dismisses, this, possibility, on, phonological, and, chronological, grounds, while, not, arriving, at, an, etymology, per, se, atwood, derives, the, name, from, the, ongi, river, in, mongolia, which, was, pronounced, the, same, as, or, similarly, to, the, name, xiongnu, and, suggests, that, it, was, originally, a, dynastic, name, rather, than, an, ethnic, name, most, of, the, ancient, descriptions, of, the, huns, stress, their, strange, appearance, from, a, roman, perspective, these, descriptions, typically, caricature, the, huns, as, monsters, jordanes, stresses, that, the, huns, were, short, of, stature, had, tanned, skin, and, round, and, shapeless, heads, various, writers, mention, that, the, huns, had, small, eyes, and, flat, noses, the, roman, writer, priscus, gives, the, following, eyewitness, description, of, attila, short, of, stature, with, a, broad, chest, and, a, large, head, his, eyes, were, small, his, beard, thin, and, sprinkled, with, grey, and, he, had, a, flat, nose, and, tanned, skin, showing, evidence, of, his, origin, many, scholars, take, these, to, be, unflattering, depictions, of, east, asian, obsolete, mongoloid, racial, characteristics, maenchen, helfen, argues, that, while, many, huns, had, east, asian, racial, characteristics, they, were, unlikely, to, have, looked, as, asiatic, as, the, yakut, or, tungus, he, notes, that, archaeological, finds, of, presumed, huns, suggest, that, they, were, a, racially, mixed, group, containing, only, some, individuals, with, east, asian, features, kim, similarly, cautions, against, seeing, the, huns, as, a, homogenous, racial, group, while, still, arguing, that, they, were, partially, or, predominantly, of, mongoloid, extraction, at, least, initially, some, archaeologists, have, argued, that, archaeological, finds, have, failed, to, prove, that, the, huns, had, any, mongoloid, features, at, all, and, some, scholars, have, argued, that, the, huns, were, predominantly, caucasian, in, appearance, other, archaeologists, have, argued, that, mongoloid, features, are, found, primarily, among, members, of, the, hunnic, aristocracy, which, however, also, included, germanic, leaders, who, were, integrated, into, the, hun, polity, kim, argues, that, the, composition, of, the, huns, became, progressively, more, caucasian, during, their, time, in, europe, he, notes, that, by, the, battle, of, chalons, 451, the, vast, majority, of, attila, s, entourage, and, troops, appears, to, have, been, of, european, origin, while, attila, himself, seems, to, have, had, east, asian, features, genetic, data, is, difficult, to, apply, to, steppe, nomad, societies, because, they, frequently, migrated, intermixed, and, were, assimilated, into, each, other, nevertheless, genetics, can, supply, information, on, migrations, from, east, asia, to, europe, and, vice, versa, in, a, genetic, study, of, individuals, from, the, around, the, tian, shan, mountains, of, central, asia, dating, from, the, late, second, century, ce, damgaard, et, al, 2018, found, that, these, individuals, represented, a, population, of, mixed, east, asian, and, west, eurasian, origin, they, argued, that, this, population, descended, from, xiongnu, who, expanded, westward, and, mixed, with, iranian, sakas, this, population, in, the, tian, shan, mountains, may, be, connected, to, the, european, huns, by, individual, burials, that, contains, objects, stylistically, related, to, those, used, by, the, european, huns, although, this, could, be, a, sign, of, the, exchange, of, goods, and, the, connections, between, elites, rather, than, a, sign, of, migration, as, of, 2023, there, is, little, genetic, data, from, the, carpathian, basin, in, the, hunnic, period, 5th, century, and, the, population, living, there, during, the, hunnic, period, shows, a, variety, of, genetic, signatures, mar, ti, et, al, 2022, showed, that, the, genomes, of, nine, hun, era, individuals, who, lived, in, the, basin, varied, from, european, to, northeast, asian, connections, with, those, individuals, showing, associations, with, northeast, asia, being, most, similar, to, groups, found, in, mongolia, such, as, the, xiongnu, and, the, xianbei, an, analysis, of, hun, era, genomes, by, gnecchi, ruscone, et, al, 2022, likewise, found, a, wide, range, of, genetic, variability, with, two, individuals, showing, a, connection, to, ancient, northeast, asians, and, others, showing, european, ancestry, the, history, of, the, huns, in, the, fourth, century, is, not, very, clear, and, the, huns, left, no, sources, themselves, the, romans, became, aware, of, the, huns, when, the, latter, s, invasion, of, the, pontic, steppes, forced, thousands, of, goths, to, move, to, the, lower, danube, to, seek, refuge, in, the, roman, empire, in, 376, the, huns, conquered, the, alans, most, of, the, greuthungi, or, eastern, goths, and, then, most, of, the, thervingi, or, western, goths, with, many, fleeing, into, the, roman, empire, in, 395, the, huns, began, their, first, large, scale, attack, on, the, eastern, roman, empire, huns, attacked, in, thrace, overran, armenia, and, pillaged, cappadocia, they, entered, parts, of, syria, threatened, antioch, and, passed, through, the, province, of, euphratesia, at, the, same, time, the, huns, invaded, the, sasanian, empire, this, invasion, was, initially, successful, coming, close, to, the, capital, of, the, empire, at, ctesiphon, however, they, were, defeated, badly, during, the, persian, counterattack, during, their, brief, diversion, from, the, eastern, roman, empire, the, huns, may, have, threatened, tribes, further, west, uldin, the, first, hun, identified, by, name, in, contemporary, sources, headed, a, group, of, huns, and, alans, fighting, against, radagaisus, in, defense, of, italy, uldin, was, also, known, for, defeating, gothic, rebels, who, troubled, the, east, romans, around, the, danube, and, for, beheading, the, goth, gainas, around, 400, 401, the, east, romans, began, to, feel, the, pressure, from, uldin, s, huns, again, in, 408, uldin, crossed, the, danube, and, pillaged, thrace, the, east, romans, tried, to, buy, off, uldin, but, his, sum, was, too, high, so, they, instead, bought, off, uldin, s, subordinates, this, resulted, in, many, desertions, from, uldin, s, group, of, huns, uldin, himself, escaped, back, across, the, danube, after, which, he, is, not, mentioned, again, in, history, hunnish, mercenaries, are, mentioned, on, several, occasions, being, employed, by, the, east, and, west, romans, as, well, as, the, goths, during, the, late, 4th, and, 5th, century, in, 433, some, parts, of, pannonia, were, ceded, to, them, by, flavius, aetius, the, magister, militum, of, the, western, roman, empire, from, 434, the, brothers, attila, and, bleda, ruled, the, huns, together, attila, and, bleda, were, as, ambitious, as, their, uncle, rugila, in, 435, they, forced, the, eastern, roman, empire, to, sign, the, treaty, of, margus, giving, the, huns, trade, rights, and, an, annual, tribute, from, the, romans, when, the, romans, breached, the, treaty, in, 440, attila, and, bleda, attacked, castra, constantias, a, roman, fortress, and, marketplace, on, the, banks, of, the, danube, war, broke, out, between, the, huns, and, romans, and, the, huns, overcame, a, weak, roman, army, to, raze, the, cities, of, margus, singidunum, and, viminacium, although, a, truce, was, concluded, in, 441, two, years, later, constantinople, again, failed, to, deliver, the, tribute, and, war, resumed, in, the, following, campaign, hun, armies, approached, constantinople, and, sacked, several, cities, before, defeating, the, romans, at, the, battle, of, chersonesus, the, eastern, roman, emperor, theodosius, ii, gave, in, to, hun, demands, and, in, autumn, 443, signed, the, peace, of, anatolius, with, the, two, hun, kings, bleda, died, in, 445, and, attila, became, the, sole, ruler, of, the, huns, in, 447, attila, invaded, the, balkans, and, thrace, the, war, came, to, an, end, in, 449, with, an, agreement, in, which, the, east, romans, agreed, to, pay, attila, an, annual, tribute, of, 2100, pounds, of, gold, throughout, their, raids, on, the, eastern, roman, empire, the, huns, had, maintained, good, relations, with, the, western, empire, however, honoria, sister, of, the, western, roman, emperor, valentinian, iii, sent, attila, a, ring, and, requested, his, help, to, escape, her, betrothal, to, a, senator, attila, claimed, her, as, his, bride, and, half, the, western, roman, empire, as, dowry, additionally, a, dispute, arose, about, the, rightful, heir, to, a, king, of, the, salian, franks, in, 451, attila, s, forces, entered, gaul, once, in, gaul, the, huns, first, attacked, metz, then, their, armies, continued, westward, passing, both, paris, and, troyes, to, lay, siege, to, orl, ans, flavius, aetius, was, given, the, duty, of, relieving, orl, ans, by, emperor, valentinian, iii, a, combined, army, of, roman, and, visigoths, then, fought, the, huns, at, the, battle, of, the, catalaunian, plains, the, following, year, attila, renewed, his, claims, to, honoria, and, territory, in, the, western, roman, empire, leading, his, army, across, the, alps, and, into, northern, italy, he, sacked, and, razed, a, number, of, cities, hoping, to, avoid, the, sack, of, rome, emperor, valentinian, iii, sent, three, envoys, the, high, civilian, officers, gennadius, avienus, and, trigetius, as, well, as, pope, leo, i, who, met, attila, at, mincio, in, the, vicinity, of, mantua, and, obtained, from, him, the, promise, that, he, would, withdraw, from, italy, and, negotiate, peace, with, the, emperor, the, new, eastern, roman, emperor, marcian, then, halted, tribute, payments, resulting, in, attila, planning, to, attack, constantinople, however, in, 453, attila, died, of, a, hemorrhage, on, his, wedding, night, after, attila, s, death, in, 453, the, hunnic, empire, faced, an, internal, power, struggle, between, its, vassalized, germanic, peoples, and, the, hunnic, ruling, body, led, by, ellak, attila, s, favored, son, and, ruler, of, the, akatziri, the, huns, engaged, the, gepid, king, ardaric, at, the, battle, of, nedao, who, led, a, germanic, coalition, to, overthrow, hunnic, imperial, authority, the, amali, goths, would, revolt, the, same, year, under, valamir, allegedly, defeating, the, huns, in, a, separate, engagement, however, this, did, not, result, in, the, complete, collapse, of, hunnic, power, in, the, carpathian, region, but, did, result, in, the, loss, of, many, of, their, germanic, vassals, at, the, same, time, the, huns, were, also, dealing, with, the, arrival, of, more, oghur, turkic, speaking, peoples, from, the, east, including, the, oghurs, saragurs, onogurs, and, the, sabirs, in, 463, the, saragurs, defeated, the, akatziri, or, akatir, huns, and, asserted, dominance, in, the, pontic, region, the, western, huns, under, dengizich, experienced, difficulties, in, 461, when, they, were, defeated, by, valamir, in, a, war, against, the, sadages, a, people, allied, with, the, huns, his, campaigning, was, also, met, with, dissatisfaction, from, ernak, ruler, of, the, akatziri, huns, who, wanted, to, focus, on, the, incoming, oghur, speaking, peoples, dengizich, attacked, the, romans, in, 467, without, the, assistance, of, ernak, he, was, surrounded, by, the, romans, and, besieged, and, came, to, an, agreement, that, he, would, surrender, if, his, people, were, given, land, for, their, herds, and, his, starving, forces, given, food, during, the, negotiations, a, hun, in, service, of, the, romans, named, chelchel, persuaded, the, enemy, goths, to, attack, their, hun, overlords, the, romans, under, their, general, aspar, and, with, the, help, of, his, bucellarii, then, attacked, the, quarreling, goths, and, huns, defeating, them, in, 469, dengizich, was, defeated, and, killed, in, thrace, after, dengizich, s, death, the, huns, seem, to, have, been, absorbed, by, other, ethnic, groups, such, as, the, bulgars, kim, however, argues, that, the, huns, continued, under, ernak, becoming, the, kutrigur, and, utigur, hunno, bulgars, this, conclusion, is, still, subject, to, some, controversy, some, scholars, also, argue, that, another, group, identified, in, ancient, sources, as, huns, the, north, caucasian, huns, were, genuine, huns, the, rulers, of, various, post, hunnic, steppe, peoples, are, known, to, have, claimed, descent, from, attila, in, order, to, legitimize, their, right, to, the, power, and, various, steppe, peoples, were, also, called, huns, by, western, and, byzantine, sources, from, the, fourth, century, onward, the, huns, have, traditionally, been, described, as, pastoral, nomads, living, off, of, herding, and, moving, from, pasture, to, pasture, to, graze, their, animals, hyun, jin, kim, however, holds, the, term, nomad, to, be, misleading, he, term, nomad, if, it, denotes, a, wandering, group, of, people, with, no, clear, sense, of, territory, cannot, be, applied, wholesale, to, the, huns, all, the, so, called, nomads, of, eurasian, steppe, history, were, peoples, whose, territory, territories, were, usually, clearly, defined, who, as, pastoralists, moved, about, in, search, of, pasture, but, within, a, fixed, territorial, space, maenchen, helfen, notes, that, pastoral, nomads, or, seminomads, typically, alternate, between, summer, pastures, and, winter, quarters, while, the, pastures, may, vary, the, winter, quarters, always, remained, the, same, this, is, in, fact, what, jordanes, writes, of, the, hunnic, altziagiri, tribe, they, pastured, near, cherson, on, the, crimea, and, then, wintered, further, north, with, maenchen, helfen, holding, the, syvash, as, a, likely, location, ancient, sources, mention, that, the, huns, herds, consisted, of, various, animals, including, cattle, horses, and, goats, sheep, though, unmentioned, in, ancient, sources, are, more, essential, to, the, steppe, nomad, even, than, horses, and, must, have, been, a, large, part, of, their, herds, sheep, bones, are, frequently, found, in, hun, period, graves, additionally, maenchen, helfen, argues, that, the, huns, may, have, kept, small, herds, of, bactrian, camels, in, the, part, of, their, territory, in, modern, romania, and, ukraine, something, attested, for, the, sarmatians, ammianus, marcellinus, says, that, the, majority, of, the, huns, diet, came, from, the, meat, of, these, animals, with, maenchen, helfen, arguing, on, the, basis, of, what, is, known, of, other, steppe, nomads, that, they, likely, mostly, ate, mutton, along, with, sheep, s, cheese, and, milk, they, also, certainly, ate, horse, meat, drank, mare, s, milk, and, likely, made, cheese, and, kumis, in, times, of, starvation, they, may, have, boiled, their, horses, blood, for, food, ancient, sources, uniformly, deny, that, the, huns, practiced, any, sort, of, agriculture, thompson, taking, these, accounts, at, their, word, argues, that, ithout, the, assistance, of, the, settled, agricultural, population, at, the, edge, of, the, steppe, they, could, not, have, survived, he, argues, that, the, huns, were, forced, to, supplement, their, diet, by, hunting, and, gathering, maenchen, helfen, however, notes, that, archaeological, finds, indicate, that, various, steppe, nomad, populations, did, grow, grain, in, particular, he, identifies, a, find, at, kunya, uaz, in, khwarezm, on, the, ob, river, of, agriculture, among, a, people, who, practiced, artificial, cranial, deformation, as, evidence, of, hunnic, agriculture, kim, similarly, argues, that, all, steppe, empires, have, possessed, both, pastoralist, and, sedentary, populations, classifying, the, huns, as, agro, pastoralist, as, a, nomadic, people, the, huns, spent, a, great, deal, of, time, riding, horses, ammianus, claimed, that, the, huns, are, almost, glued, to, their, horses, zosimus, claimed, that, they, live, and, sleep, on, their, horses, and, sidonius, claimed, that, carce, had, an, infant, learnt, to, stand, without, his, mother, s, aid, when, a, horse, takes, him, on, his, back, they, appear, to, have, spent, so, much, time, riding, that, they, walked, clumsily, something, observed, in, other, nomadic, groups, roman, sources, characterize, the, hunnic, horses, as, ugly, it, is, not, possible, to, determine, the, exact, breed, of, horse, the, huns, used, despite, a, relatively, good, description, by, the, roman, writer, vegetius, sinor, believes, that, it, was, likely, a, breed, of, mongolian, pony, however, horse, remains, are, absent, from, all, identified, hun, burials, based, on, anthropological, descriptions, and, archaeological, finds, of, other, nomadic, horses, maenchen, helfen, believes, that, they, rode, mostly, geldings, apart, from, horses, ancient, sources, indicate, that, the, huns, used, wagons, for, transportation, maenchen, helfen, suggests, that, these, wagons, were, mainly, utilized, to, carry, their, tents, loot, as, well, as, the, elderly, women, and, children, the, huns, received, a, large, amount, of, gold, from, the, romans, either, in, exchange, for, fighting, for, them, as, mercenaries, or, as, tribute, raiding, and, looting, also, furnished, the, huns, with, gold, and, other, valuables, denis, sinor, has, argued, that, at, the, time, of, attila, the, hunnic, economy, became, almost, entirely, dependent, on, plunder, and, tribute, from, the, roman, provinces, civilians, and, soldiers, captured, by, the, huns, might, also, be, ransomed, back, or, else, sold, to, roman, slave, dealers, as, slaves, the, huns, themselves, maenchen, helfen, argued, had, little, use, for, slaves, due, to, their, nomadic, pastoralist, lifestyle, more, recent, scholarship, however, has, demonstrated, that, pastoral, nomadists, are, actually, more, likely, to, use, slave, labor, than, sedentary, societies, the, slaves, would, have, been, used, to, manage, the, huns, herds, of, cattle, sheep, and, goats, priscus, attests, that, slaves, were, used, as, domestic, servants, but, also, that, educated, slaves, were, used, by, the, huns, in, positions, of, administration, or, even, architects, some, slaves, were, even, used, as, warriors, the, huns, also, traded, with, the, romans, e, a, thompson, argued, that, this, trade, was, very, large, scale, with, the, huns, trading, horses, furs, meat, and, slaves, for, roman, weapons, linen, and, grain, and, various, other, luxury, goods, while, maenchen, helfen, concedes, that, the, huns, traded, their, horses, for, what, he, considered, to, have, been, a, very, considerable, source, of, income, in, gold, he, is, otherwise, skeptical, of, thompson, s, argument, he, notes, that, the, romans, strictly, regulated, trade, with, the, barbarians, and, that, according, to, priscus, trade, only, occurred, at, a, fair, once, a, year, while, he, notes, that, smuggling, also, likely, occurred, he, argues, that, the, volume, of, both, legal, and, illegal, trade, was, apparently, modest, he, does, note, that, wine, and, silk, appear, to, have, been, imported, into, the, hunnic, empire, in, large, quantities, however, roman, gold, coins, appear, to, have, been, in, circulation, as, currency, within, the, whole, of, the, hunnic, empire, christopher, atwood, has, suggested, that, the, purpose, of, the, original, hunnic, incursion, into, europe, may, have, been, to, establish, an, outlet, to, the, black, sea, for, the, sogdian, merchants, under, their, rule, who, were, involved, in, the, trade, along, the, silk, road, to, china, atwood, notes, that, jordanes, describes, how, the, crimean, city, of, cherson, where, the, avaricious, traders, bring, in, the, goods, of, asia, was, under, the, control, of, the, akatziri, huns, in, the, sixth, century, hunnic, governmental, structure, has, long, been, debated, peter, heather, argues, that, the, huns, were, a, disorganized, confederation, in, which, leaders, acted, completely, independently, and, that, eventually, established, a, ranking, hierarchy, much, like, germanic, societies, denis, sinor, similarly, notes, that, with, the, exception, of, the, historically, uncertain, balamber, no, hun, leaders, are, named, in, the, sources, until, uldin, indicating, their, relative, unimportance, thompson, argues, that, permanent, kingship, only, developed, with, the, huns, invasion, of, europe, and, the, near, constant, warfare, that, followed, regarding, the, organization, of, hunnic, rule, under, attila, peter, golden, comments, it, can, hardly, be, called, a, state, much, less, an, empire, golden, speaks, instead, of, a, hunnic, confederacy, kim, however, argues, that, the, huns, were, far, more, organized, and, centralized, with, some, basis, in, organization, of, the, xiongnu, state, walter, pohl, notes, the, correspondences, of, hunnic, government, to, those, of, other, steppe, empires, but, nevertheless, argues, that, the, huns, do, not, appear, to, have, been, a, unified, group, when, they, arrived, in, europe, ammianus, wrote, that, the, huns, of, his, day, had, no, kings, but, rather, that, each, group, of, huns, instead, had, a, group, of, leading, men, primates, for, times, of, war, e, a, thompson, supposes, that, even, in, war, the, leading, men, had, little, actual, power, he, further, argues, that, they, most, likely, did, not, acquire, their, position, purely, hereditarily, heather, however, argues, that, ammianus, merely, meant, that, the, huns, didn, t, have, a, single, ruler, he, notes, that, olympiodorus, mentions, the, huns, having, several, kings, with, one, being, the, first, of, the, kings, ammianus, also, mentions, that, the, huns, made, their, decisions, in, a, general, council, omnes, in, commune, while, seated, on, horseback, he, makes, no, mention, of, the, huns, being, organized, into, tribes, but, priscus, and, other, writers, do, naming, some, of, them, the, first, hunnic, ruler, known, by, name, is, uldin, thompson, takes, uldin, s, sudden, disappearance, after, he, was, unsuccessful, at, war, as, a, sign, that, the, hunnic, kingship, was, democratic, at, this, time, rather, than, a, permanent, institution, kim, however, argues, that, uldin, is, actually, a, title, and, that, he, was, likely, merely, a, subking, priscus, calls, attila, king, or, emperor, but, it, is, unknown, what, native, title, he, was, translating, with, the, exception, of, the, sole, rule, of, attila, the, huns, often, had, two, rulers, attila, himself, later, appointed, his, son, ellac, as, co, king, heather, argues, that, by, the, time, of, the, report, of, olympiodorus, the, huns, at, some, point, developed, a, system, of, ranked, kings, including, a, senior, king, by, the, time, of, charaton, priscus, also, speaks, of, picked, men, or, logades, forming, part, of, attila, s, government, naming, five, of, them, some, of, the, picked, men, seem, to, have, been, chosen, because, of, birth, others, for, reasons, of, merit, thompson, argued, that, these, picked, men, were, the, hinge, upon, which, the, entire, administration, of, the, hun, empire, turned, he, argues, for, their, existence, in, the, government, of, uldin, and, that, each, had, command, over, detachments, of, the, hunnic, army, and, ruled, over, specific, portions, of, the, hunnic, empire, where, they, were, responsible, also, for, collecting, tribute, and, provisions, maenchen, helfen, however, argues, that, the, word, logades, denotes, simply, prominent, individuals, and, not, a, fixed, rank, with, fixed, duties, kim, affirms, the, importance, of, the, logades, for, hunnic, administration, but, notes, that, there, were, differences, of, rank, between, them, and, suggests, that, it, was, more, likely, lower, ranking, officials, who, gathered, taxes, and, tribute, he, suggests, that, various, roman, defectors, to, the, huns, may, have, worked, in, a, sort, of, imperial, bureaucracy, unlike, the, iranian, huns, who, quickly, began, to, mint, their, own, coinage, the, european, huns, did, not, strike, their, own, coins, the, extent, of, hunnish, control, in, barbarian, europe, is, poorly, understood, as, it, is, not, much, covered, in, roman, sources, it, is, generally, assumed, that, they, established, an, empire, that, stretched, as, far, west, as, the, rhine, and, perhaps, as, far, north, as, the, baltic, though, it, is, difficult, to, establish, its, boundaries, with, certainty, some, scholars, such, as, otto, maenchen, helfen, and, peter, golden, believe, that, the, extant, of, attila, s, empire, has, been, exaggerated, and, he, probably, only, controlled, pannonia, and, some, adjacent, areas, in, the, 390s, the, majority, of, the, huns, were, probably, based, around, the, volga, and, don, on, the, pontic, steppe, but, by, the, 420s, the, huns, were, based, on, great, hungarian, plain, the, only, large, grassland, near, the, roman, empire, capable, of, supporting, large, numbers, of, horses, however, aleksander, paro, believes, that, they, likely, continued, to, control, the, pontic, steppe, north, of, the, black, sea, they, had, conquered, the, hungarian, plain, in, stages, the, precise, date, that, they, conquered, the, north, bank, of, the, danube, is, unclear, maenchen, helfen, argued, that, they, may, have, already, taken, control, of, it, in, the, 370s, the, dates, when, they, gained, control, of, the, roman, territory, south, of, the, middle, danube, pannonia, valeria, and, the, other, provinces, of, pannonia, is, likewise, disputed, but, probably, in, 406, 407, and, 431, 433, respectively, otherwise, the, huns, made, no, attempt, to, conquer, or, settle, on, roman, territory, following, attila, s, death, the, huns, were, driven, out, of, pannonia, and, some, appear, to, have, returned, to, the, pontic, steppe, while, one, group, settled, in, dobruja, one, of, the, only, written, sources, for, the, size, of, attila, s, domain, is, given, by, the, roman, historian, priscus, priscus, refers, to, attila, ruling, as, far, as, the, islands, in, the, ocean, but, it, is, unclear, if, this, meant, the, baltic, sea, or, the, world, encircling, ocean, that, the, greeks, and, romans, believed, in, in, either, case, the, description, of, attila, ruling, as, far, as, the, islands, in, the, ocean, may, be, hyperbole, archaeology, is, often, used, to, argue, for, an, area, having, been, under, hunnic, control, however, nomadic, peoples, often, control, territories, beyond, their, immediate, settlement, a, large, number, of, major, finds, from, silesia, and, lesser, poland, north, of, the, carpathian, mountains, have, been, attributed, to, the, time, of, attila, and, associated, with, the, nomadic, milieu, of, the, huns, while, scholars, have, speculated, about, direct, hunnic, control, and, settlement, here, it, is, entirely, unclear, what, kind, of, relationship, the, population, of, these, regions, had, to, the, huns, the, huns, ruled, over, numerous, other, groups, including, goths, gepids, sarmatians, heruli, alans, rugii, suevi, and, sciri, alongside, other, groups, where, they, occasionally, asserted, control, peter, heather, suggests, that, some, of, these, groups, were, resettled, along, the, danube, by, the, huns, subject, peoples, of, the, huns, were, led, by, their, own, kings, those, recognized, as, ethnic, huns, appear, to, have, had, more, rights, and, status, as, evidenced, by, the, account, of, priscus, one, of, the, principal, sources, of, information, on, hunnic, warfare, is, ammianus, marcellinus, who, includes, an, extended, description, of, the, huns, methods, of, war, they, also, sometimes, fight, when, provoked, and, then, they, enter, the, battle, drawn, up, in, wedge, shaped, masses, while, their, medley, of, voices, makes, a, savage, noise, and, as, they, are, lightly, equipped, for, swift, motion, and, unexpected, in, action, they, purposely, divide, suddenly, into, scattered, bands, and, attack, rushing, about, in, disorder, here, and, there, dealing, terrific, slaughter, and, because, of, their, extraordinary, rapidity, of, movement, they, are, never, seen, to, attack, a, rampart, or, pillage, an, enemy, s, camp, and, on, this, account, you, would, not, hesitate, to, call, them, the, most, terrible, of, all, warriors, because, they, fight, from, a, distance, with, missiles, having, sharp, bone, instead, of, their, usual, points, joined, to, the, shafts, with, wonderful, skill, then, they, gallop, over, the, intervening, spaces, and, fight, hand, to, hand, with, swords, regardless, of, their, own, lives, and, while, the, enemy, are, guarding, against, wounds, from, the, sabre, thrusts, they, throw, strips, of, cloth, plaited, into, nooses, over, their, opponents, and, so, entangle, them, that, they, fetter, their, limbs, and, take, from, them, the, power, of, riding, or, walking, based, on, ammianus, description, maenchen, helfen, argues, that, the, huns, tactics, did, not, differ, markedly, from, those, used, by, other, nomadic, horse, archers, he, argues, that, the, wedge, shaped, masses, cunei, mentioned, by, ammianus, were, likely, divisions, organized, by, tribal, clans, and, families, whose, leaders, may, have, been, called, a, cur, this, title, would, then, have, been, inherited, as, it, was, passed, down, the, clan, like, ammianus, the, sixth, century, writer, zosimus, also, emphasizes, the, huns, almost, exclusive, use, of, horse, archers, and, their, extreme, swiftness, and, mobility, these, qualities, differed, from, other, nomadic, warriors, in, europe, at, this, time, the, sarmatians, for, instance, relied, on, heavily, armored, cataphracts, armed, with, lances, the, huns, use, of, terrible, war, cries, are, also, found, in, other, sources, however, a, number, of, ammianus, s, claims, have, been, challenged, by, modern, scholars, in, particular, while, ammianus, claims, that, the, huns, knew, no, metalworking, maenchen, helfen, argues, that, a, people, so, primitive, could, never, have, been, successful, in, war, against, the, romans, hunnic, armies, relied, on, their, high, mobility, and, a, shrewd, sense, of, when, to, attack, and, when, to, withdraw, an, important, strategy, used, by, the, huns, was, a, feigned, retreat, pretending, to, flee, and, then, turning, and, attacking, the, disordered, enemy, this, is, mentioned, by, the, writers, zosimus, and, agathias, they, were, however, not, always, effective, in, pitched, battle, suffering, defeat, at, toulouse, in, 439, barely, winning, at, the, battle, of, the, utus, in, 447, likely, losing, or, stalemating, at, the, battle, of, the, catalaunian, plains, in, 451, and, losing, at, the, battle, of, nedao, 454, christopher, kelly, argues, that, attila, sought, to, avoid, as, far, as, possible, large, scale, engagement, with, the, roman, army, war, and, the, threat, of, war, were, frequently, used, tools, to, extort, rome, the, huns, often, relied, on, local, traitors, to, avoid, losses, accounts, of, battles, note, that, the, huns, fortified, their, camps, by, using, portable, fences, or, creating, a, circle, of, wagons, the, huns, nomadic, lifestyle, encouraged, features, such, as, excellent, horsemanship, while, the, huns, trained, for, war, by, frequent, hunting, several, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, huns, had, trouble, maintaining, their, horse, cavalry, and, nomadic, lifestyle, after, settling, on, the, hungarian, plain, and, that, this, in, turn, led, to, a, marked, decrease, in, their, effectiveness, as, fighters, the, huns, are, almost, always, noted, as, fighting, alongside, non, hunnic, germanic, or, iranian, subject, peoples, or, in, earlier, times, allies, as, heather, notes, the, huns, military, machine, increased, and, increased, very, quickly, by, incorporating, ever, larger, numbers, of, the, germani, of, central, and, eastern, europe, at, the, battle, of, the, catalaunian, plains, attila, is, noted, by, jordanes, to, have, placed, his, subject, peoples, in, the, wings, of, the, army, while, the, huns, held, the, center, peter, heather, notes, that, the, huns, were, able, to, successfully, besiege, walled, cities, and, fortresses, in, their, campaign, of, 441, they, were, thus, capable, of, building, siege, engines, heather, makes, note, of, multiple, possible, routes, for, acquisition, of, this, knowledge, suggesting, that, it, could, have, been, brought, back, from, service, under, aetius, acquired, from, captured, roman, engineers, or, developed, through, the, need, to, pressure, the, wealthy, silk, road, city, states, and, carried, over, into, europe, artificial, cranial, deformation, the, process, of, artificially, lengthening, the, skulls, of, babies, by, binding, them, first, appears, in, europe, on, the, pontic, steppe, in, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, centuries, ce, before, spreading, to, the, carpathian, basin, becoming, common, there, in, the, 5th, century, during, the, hun, period, between, 50, and, 80, of, all, burials, in, the, carpathian, basin, contain, individuals, with, artificial, cranial, deformation, this, chronology, and, its, spread, in, europe, has, been, linked, to, nomadic, invasions, from, asia, and, in, particularly, the, spread, of, the, huns, with, the, argument, that, it, was, practiced, by, their, nobility, and, then, taken, up, by, germanic, groups, influenced, by, them, in, particular, the, gepids, some, scholars, argue, that, the, practice, was, not, originally, introduced, to, europe, by, the, huns, however, but, rather, with, the, alans, with, whom, the, huns, were, closely, associated, and, sarmatians, in, kim, s, view, the, goal, of, this, process, was, to, create, a, clear, physical, distinction, between, the, nobility, and, the, general, populace, susanne, hakenbeck, however, notes, that, graves, with, individuals, who, had, undergone, artificial, cranial, deformation, are, not, usually, distinct, from, other, individuals, she, suggests, instead, that, the, process, was, used, to, show, kinship, and, distinguish, families, something, attested, for, the, practice, in, mesoamerica, a, variety, of, languages, were, spoken, within, the, hun, empire, priscus, noted, that, the, hunnic, language, differed, from, other, languages, spoken, at, attila, s, court, he, recounts, how, attila, s, jester, zerco, made, attila, s, guests, laugh, also, by, the, promiscuous, jumble, of, words, latin, mixed, with, hunnish, and, gothic, priscus, said, that, attila, s, scythian, subjects, spoke, besides, their, own, barbarian, tongues, either, hunnish, or, gothic, or, as, many, have, dealings, with, the, western, romans, latin, but, not, one, of, them, easily, speaks, greek, except, captives, from, the, thracian, or, illyrian, frontier, regions, some, scholars, have, argued, that, gothic, was, used, as, the, lingua, franca, of, the, hunnic, empire, hyun, jin, kim, argues, that, the, huns, may, have, used, as, many, as, four, languages, at, various, levels, of, government, without, any, one, being, dominant, hunnic, gothic, latin, and, sarmatian, as, to, the, hunnic, language, itself, there, is, no, consensus, on, its, relationship, to, other, languages, only, three, words, are, recorded, in, ancient, sources, as, being, hunnic, all, of, which, appear, to, be, from, an, indo, european, language, all, other, information, on, hunnic, is, contained, in, personal, names, and, tribal, ethnonyms, on, the, basis, of, these, names, scholars, have, proposed, that, hunnic, may, have, been, a, turkic, language, a, language, between, mongolic, and, turkic, an, eastern, iranian, language, or, a, yeniseian, language, however, given, the, small, corpus, many, hold, the, language, to, be, unclassifiable, the, elites, of, the, huns, practiced, polygamy, while, the, commoners, were, probably, monogamous, ammianus, marcellinus, claimed, that, the, hunnish, women, lived, in, seclusion, however, the, first, hand, account, of, priscus, shows, them, freely, moving, and, mixing, with, men, priscus, describes, hunnic, women, swarming, around, attila, as, he, entered, a, village, as, well, as, the, wife, of, attila, s, minister, onegesius, offering, the, king, food, and, drink, with, her, servants, priscus, was, able, to, enter, the, tent, of, attila, s, chief, wife, hereca, without, difficulty, priscus, also, attests, that, the, widow, of, attila, s, brother, bleda, was, in, command, of, a, village, that, the, roman, ambassadors, rode, through, her, territory, may, have, included, a, larger, area, thompson, notes, that, other, steppe, peoples, such, as, the, utigurs, and, the, sabirs, are, known, to, have, had, female, tribal, leaders, and, argues, that, the, huns, probably, held, widows, in, high, respect, due, to, the, pastoral, nature, of, the, huns, economy, the, women, likely, had, a, large, degree, of, authority, over, the, domestic, household, almost, nothing, is, known, about, the, religion, of, the, huns, roman, writer, ammianus, marcellinus, claimed, that, the, huns, had, no, religion, while, the, fifth, century, christian, writer, salvian, classified, them, as, pagans, jordanes, getica, also, records, that, the, huns, worshipped, the, sword, of, mars, an, ancient, sword, that, signified, attila, s, right, to, rule, the, whole, world, maenchen, helfen, notes, a, widespread, worship, of, a, war, god, in, the, form, of, a, sword, among, steppe, peoples, including, among, the, xiongnu, denis, sinor, however, holds, the, worship, of, a, sword, among, the, huns, to, be, apocryphal, additionally, maenchen, helfen, argues, that, while, the, huns, themselves, do, not, appear, to, have, regarded, attila, as, divine, some, of, his, subject, people, clearly, did, a, belief, in, prophecy, and, divination, is, also, attested, among, the, huns, maenchen, helfen, argues, that, the, performers, of, these, acts, of, soothsaying, and, divination, were, likely, shamans, sinor, also, finds, it, likely, that, the, huns, had, shamans, although, they, are, completely, unattested, maenchen, helfen, further, deduces, a, belief, in, water, spirits, from, a, custom, mentioned, in, ammianus, he, furthermore, suggests, that, the, huns, may, have, made, small, metal, wooden, or, stone, idols, which, are, attested, among, other, steppe, tribes, and, which, a, byzantine, source, attests, for, the, huns, in, crimea, in, the, sixth, century, moreover, he, connects, archaeological, finds, of, hunnish, bronze, cauldrons, found, buried, near, or, in, running, water, to, possible, rituals, performed, by, the, huns, in, the, spring, john, man, argues, that, the, huns, of, attila, s, time, likely, worshipped, the, sky, and, the, steppe, deity, tengri, who, is, also, attested, as, having, been, worshipped, by, the, xiongnu, maenchen, helfen, also, suggests, the, possibility, that, the, huns, of, this, period, may, have, worshipped, tengri, but, notes, that, the, god, is, not, attested, in, european, records, until, the, ninth, century, worship, of, tengri, under, the, name, t, angri, khan, is, attested, among, the, caucasian, huns, in, the, armenian, chronicle, attributed, to, movses, dasxuranci, during, the, later, seventh, century, movses, also, records, that, the, caucasian, huns, worshipped, trees, and, burnt, horses, as, sacrifices, to, tengri, and, that, they, made, sacrifices, to, fire, and, water, and, to, certain, gods, of, the, roads, and, to, the, moon, and, to, all, creatures, considered, in, their, eyes, to, be, in, some, way, remarkable, there, is, some, evidence, for, human, sacrifice, among, the, european, huns, maenchen, helfen, argues, that, humans, appear, to, have, been, sacrificed, at, attila, s, funerary, rite, recorded, in, jordanes, under, the, name, strava, priscus, claims, that, the, huns, sacrificed, their, prisoners, to, victory, after, they, entered, scythia, but, this, is, not, otherwise, attested, as, a, hunnic, custom, and, may, be, fiction, in, addition, to, these, pagan, beliefs, there, are, numerous, attestations, of, huns, converting, to, christianity, and, receiving, christian, missionaries, the, missionary, activities, among, the, huns, of, the, caucasus, seem, to, have, been, particularly, successful, resulting, in, the, conversion, of, the, hunnish, prince, alp, ilteber, attila, appears, to, have, tolerated, both, nicene, and, arian, christianity, among, his, subjects, however, a, pastoral, letter, by, pope, leo, the, great, to, the, church, of, aquileia, indicates, that, christian, slaves, taken, from, there, by, the, huns, in, 452, were, forced, to, participate, in, hunnic, religious, activities, an, account, of, the, funeral, of, attila, is, provided, by, jordanes, who, may, derive, it, from, priscus, jordanes, reports, that, the, huns, cut, their, hair, and, disfigured, their, faces, with, swords, as, part, of, the, rite, a, widely, attested, custom, among, steppe, peoples, after, this, attila, s, coffin, was, placed, in, a, silk, tent, and, horsemen, rode, around, it, singing, funeral, dirges, called, a, strava, the, coffin, was, then, covered, in, precious, metals, and, buried, secretly, together, with, weapons, and, the, slaves, who, dug, the, grave, were, killed, to, keep, the, location, secret, maenchen, helfen, suggests, that, the, dirges, and, the, horsemanship, were, likely, separate, events, with, the, latter, possibly, representing, funereal, horse, races, as, found, among, other, steppe, peoples, while, the, killing, of, the, slaves, may, have, been, a, sacrifice, although, a, great, amount, of, archaeological, material, has, been, unearthed, since, 1945, as, of, 2005, there, were, only, 200, burials, that, have, plausibly, identified, as, hunnic, including, both, in, the, carpathian, basin, and, the, pontic, steppe, hun, period, burials, identified, with, the, nomadic, milieu, on, the, eurasian, steppe, and, in, the, carpathian, basin, typically, feature, rich, deposits, of, grave, goods, which, modern, archaeologists, call, totenopfer, offerings, to, the, dead, however, the, richest, nomad, related, burials, have, all, been, found, in, other, locations, than, the, carpathian, basin, although, this, was, attila, s, center, of, power, and, one, would, expect, to, find, elite, burials, clustered, there, most, burials, from, the, carpathian, basin, match, the, material, culture, of, the, previously, indigenous, germanic, peoples, the, dearth, of, hun, related, burials, may, indicate, that, most, hunnish, funerals, may, have, disposed, of, the, body, in, such, a, way, that, no, remains, were, left, or, that, they, adopted, germanic, material, culture, frequently, nomad, related, graves, from, the, hun, period, contain, evidence, of, objects, being, burned, probably, as, part, of, the, burial, ceremonies, the, common, nomadic, practice, of, burying, parts, of, animals, such, as, their, shoulder, blades, or, limbs, with, the, deceased, is, only, attested, rarely, in, the, carpathian, basin, likewise, while, central, asian, and, east, european, nomad, burials, frequently, feature, kurgans, these, are, entirely, absent, in, the, carpathian, basin, there, are, two, sources, for, the, material, culture, of, the, huns, ancient, descriptions, and, archaeology, roman, descriptions, of, the, huns, are, often, highly, biased, stressing, the, huns, supposed, primitiveness, unfortunately, the, nomadic, nature, of, hun, society, means, that, they, have, left, very, little, in, the, archaeological, record, it, can, be, difficult, to, distinguish, hunnic, archaeological, finds, from, those, of, the, sarmatians, as, both, peoples, lived, in, close, proximity, and, seem, to, have, had, very, similar, material, cultures, kim, thus, cautions, that, it, is, difficult, to, assign, any, artifact, to, the, huns, ethnically, archaeological, finds, have, produced, a, large, number, of, cauldrons, that, have, since, the, work, of, paul, reinecke, in, 1896, been, identified, as, having, been, produced, by, the, huns, although, typically, described, as, bronze, cauldrons, the, cauldrons, are, often, made, of, copper, which, is, generally, of, poor, quality, maenchen, helfen, lists, 19, known, finds, of, hunnish, cauldrons, from, all, over, central, and, eastern, europe, and, western, siberia, he, argues, from, the, state, of, the, bronze, castings, that, the, huns, were, not, very, good, metalsmiths, and, that, it, is, likely, that, the, cauldrons, were, cast, in, the, same, locations, where, they, were, found, they, come, in, various, shapes, and, are, sometimes, found, together, with, vessels, of, various, other, origins, maenchen, helfen, argues, that, the, cauldrons, were, cooking, vessels, for, boiling, meat, but, that, the, fact, that, many, are, found, deposited, near, water, and, were, generally, not, buried, with, individuals, may, indicate, a, sacral, usage, as, well, the, cauldrons, appear, to, derive, from, those, used, by, the, xiongnu, good, descriptions, of, hun, period, clothing, known, from, contemporary, central, asian, burials, to, have, probably, been, the, khalat, are, lacking, in, greco, roman, sources, the, east, roman, historian, priscus, reports, seeing, a, greek, merchant, who, he, took, for, a, hun, due, to, his, wearing, scythian, clothing, this, appears, to, show, that, the, huns, wore, a, distinct, outfit, that, was, part, of, ethnic, identification, ammianus, reports, that, the, huns, wore, clothes, made, of, linen, or, the, furs, of, mice, and, leggings, of, goatskin, which, they, did, not, wash, while, the, use, of, furs, and, linen, may, be, accurate, the, description, of, the, huns, in, dirty, animal, skins, and, wearing, the, skins, of, mice, is, clearly, derived, from, negative, stereotypes, and, topoi, about, primitive, barbarians, priscus, also, mentions, the, use, of, various, expensive, and, rare, animal, furs, and, mentions, the, handmaidens, of, attila, s, queen, kreka, weaving, decorative, linen, using, finds, from, modern, kazakhstan, archaeologist, joachim, werner, has, described, hunnic, clothing, as, probably, consisting, of, knee, length, sleeved, smocks, the, khalat, which, were, sometimes, made, of, silk, as, well, as, trousers, and, leather, boots, saint, jerome, and, ammianus, both, describe, the, huns, as, wearing, a, round, cap, that, was, probably, made, of, felt, because, nomadic, clothing, had, no, need, for, brooches, the, absence, of, this, otherwise, common, item, in, some, barbarian, burials, may, indicate, hunnic, cultural, influence, according, to, maenchen, helfen, the, huns, shoes, were, likely, made, of, sheep, s, leather, the, b, ntapuszta, figurine, is, wearing, high, bulky, boots, that, are, connected, to, the, warrior, s, chainmail, by, straps, of, a, type, also, described, by, priscus, jewelry, and, weapons, attributed, to, the, huns, are, often, decorated, in, a, polychrome, cloisonn, style, archaeologist, joachim, werner, argued, that, the, huns, developed, a, unique, danubian, style, of, art, that, combined, asiatic, goldsmithing, techniques, with, the, enormous, amount, of, gold, given, as, tribute, to, the, huns, by, the, romans, this, style, then, influenced, european, art, in, the, 1970s, a, k, ambroz, argued, that, the, polychrome, style, originated, with, the, huns, however, more, recent, archaeological, discoveries, show, that, it, predates, their, arrival, in, europe, warwick, ball, moreover, argues, that, the, decorated, artifacts, of, the, hunnish, period, were, probably, made, by, local, craftsmen, for, the, huns, rather, than, by, the, huns, themselves, a, now, headless, copper, plated, hun, period, figurine, discovered, at, b, ntapuszta, near, veszpr, m, hungary, shows, a, man, in, armor, whose, pants, and, collars, have, been, decorated, by, ringlets, archaeological, finds, indicate, that, the, huns, wore, gold, plaques, as, ornaments, on, their, clothing, as, well, as, imported, glass, beads, the, golden, plaques, were, probably, used, to, decorate, the, hems, of, both, male, and, female, festive, clothing, this, fashion, seems, to, have, been, adopted, both, by, the, huns, and, east, germanic, elites, both, men, and, women, have, been, found, wearing, shoe, buckles, made, of, gold, and, jewels, in, eastern, europe, but, of, iron, or, bronze, in, central, asia, the, golden, shoe, buckles, are, also, found, in, non, hunnic, graves, in, europe, both, ancient, sources, and, archaeological, finds, from, graves, confirm, that, the, hunnic, women, wore, elaborately, decorated, golden, or, gold, plated, diadems, these, diadems, as, well, as, elements, of, bonnets, were, probably, symbols, of, rulership, women, are, also, found, buried, with, small, mirrors, of, an, originally, chinese, type, which, often, appear, to, have, been, intentionally, broken, when, placed, into, a, grave, hunnic, women, seem, to, have, worn, necklaces, and, bracelets, of, mostly, imported, beads, of, various, materials, as, well, men, are, often, found, buried, with, single, or, paired, earrings, and, unusually, for, a, nomadic, people, bronze, or, golden, neck, rings, ammianus, reports, that, the, huns, had, no, buildings, but, in, passing, mentions, that, the, huns, possessed, tents, and, also, lived, in, wagons, no, tents, or, wagons, have, been, found, in, hunnic, archaeological, contexts, as, they, were, evidently, not, buried, with, the, deceased, maenchen, helfen, believes, that, the, huns, likely, had, tents, of, felt, and, sheepskin, priscus, once, mentions, attila, s, tent, and, jordanes, reports, that, attila, lay, in, state, in, a, silk, tent, however, by, the, middle, of, the, fifth, century, priscus, mentions, that, the, huns, owned, permanent, wooden, houses, which, maenchen, helfen, believes, were, built, by, their, gothic, subjects, ancient, roman, sources, stress, the, importance, of, the, bow, to, the, huns, and, it, was, the, huns, main, weapon, the, huns, used, a, composite, or, reflex, bow, of, what, is, often, called, the, hun, type, a, style, that, had, spread, to, all, steppe, nomads, on, the, eurasian, steppe, by, the, beginning, of, the, hun, period, they, measured, between, 120, and, 150, centimeters, examples, are, vary, rare, in, the, archaeological, record, with, finds, in, europe, clustering, on, the, pontic, steppe, and, middle, danube, region, the, rarity, of, surviving, examples, means, that, making, precise, statements, about, the, advantages, of, this, weapon, is, challenging, the, bows, were, difficult, to, construct, and, probably, objects, of, great, value, they, were, made, out, of, a, flexible, wood, strips, of, either, antler, or, bone, and, animal, sinew, the, bone, used, to, strengthen, the, bow, made, it, more, durable, but, probably, less, powerful, the, graves, of, figures, identified, as, princes, among, the, huns, have, been, found, buried, with, golden, ceremonial, bows, in, a, wide, area, from, the, rhine, to, the, dnieper, bows, were, buried, with, the, object, placed, across, the, chest, of, the, deceased, the, bows, shot, larger, arrows, than, the, earlier, scythian, type, bows, with, the, appearance, of, iron, three, lobed, arrowheads, in, the, archaeological, record, taken, as, a, sign, of, their, spread, ammianus, while, recognizing, the, importance, of, hunnic, bows, does, not, appear, well, informed, about, them, and, claims, among, other, things, that, the, huns, only, used, bone, pointed, arrows, riding, equipment, and, harnesses, are, frequent, finds, from, hun, period, burials, the, huns, did, not, have, spurs, and, so, used, whips, to, drive, their, horses, the, handles, of, such, whips, have, been, found, in, nomad, graves, the, huns, have, customarily, been, considered, the, inventors, of, a, wooden, framed, saddle, maenchen, helfen, for, instance, argued, that, the, surviving, ornamentation, from, nomad, graves, dating, to, the, hun, period, showed, that, the, saddles, must, have, had, a, wooden, frame, however, oleksandr, symonenko, argues, more, recent, work, has, shown, that, the, huns, still, used, an, earlier, style, of, saddle, made, of, padding, the, huns, are, also, commonly, credited, with, having, introduced, the, stirrup, to, europe, these, appear, to, have, been, used, by, other, xiongnu, successor, groups, in, asia, from, the, 5th, century, ce, onward, however, no, stirrups, have, been, found, in, hunnic, burials, nor, is, there, any, textual, evidence, of, their, use, maenchen, helfen, also, argues, against, the, huns, having, used, stirrups, on, the, grounds, that, there, is, no, evidence, for, their, use, after, the, end, of, the, hun, empire, even, though, they, could, easily, have, been, copied, by, subject, peoples, without, stirrups, the, huns, would, not, have, had, the, stability, to, fight, in, close, combat, on, horseback, and, thus, appear, to, have, preferred, fighting, using, bows, and, arrows, the, lack, of, stirrups, would, have, required, special, techniques, for, firing, arrows, from, horseback, defensive, equipment, and, chainmail, are, rare, finds, in, hunnic, period, graves, ammianus, makes, no, mention, of, any, use, of, armor, among, the, huns, however, it, is, believed, that, the, huns, made, use, of, lamellar, armor, a, style, of, armor, popular, among, steppe, nomads, during, this, time, metal, armor, was, probably, a, rarity, the, huns, may, have, used, a, type, of, helmet, known, as, the, spangenhelm, but, hunnic, nobles, may, have, worn, helmets, of, various, types, ammianus, reports, that, the, huns, used, iron, swords, and, ceremonial, swords, daggers, and, decorated, scabbards, are, frequent, finds, in, hun, period, burials, additionally, pearls, are, often, found, with, swords, these, decorative, elements, may, have, had, a, religious, meaning, beginning, with, joachim, werner, archaeologists, have, argued, that, the, huns, may, have, originated, the, fashion, of, decorating, swords, with, cloisonn, however, philip, von, rummel, argues, these, swords, show, strong, mediterranean, influence, are, rare, in, the, carpathian, basin, from, the, hun, period, and, may, have, been, produced, by, byzantine, workshops, thompson, is, skeptical, that, the, huns, could, cast, iron, themselves, but, maenchen, helfen, argues, that, he, idea, that, the, hun, horsemen, fought, their, way, to, the, walls, of, constantinople, and, to, the, marne, with, bartered, and, captured, swords, is, absurd, one, characteristic, sword, used, by, the, huns, and, their, subject, peoples, was, the, narrow, bladed, long, seax, since, the, work, of, j, werner, in, the, 1950s, many, scholars, have, believed, that, the, huns, introduced, this, type, of, sword, to, europe, in, the, earliest, versions, these, swords, seem, to, have, been, shorter, stabbing, weapons, the, huns, along, with, the, alans, and, the, eastern, germanic, peoples, also, used, a, type, of, sword, known, as, an, east, germanic, or, asian, spatha, a, long, double, edged, iron, sword, with, an, iron, cross, guard, these, swords, would, have, been, used, to, cut, down, enemies, who, had, already, been, driven, to, flight, by, the, huns, volleys, of, arrows, roman, sources, also, mention, lassos, as, weapons, used, at, close, range, to, immobilize, opponents, some, huns, or, their, subject, peoples, may, also, have, carried, heavy, lances, as, is, attested, for, some, hunnic, mercenaries, in, roman, sources, after, the, fall, of, the, hunnic, empire, various, legends, arose, concerning, the, huns, among, these, are, a, number, of, christian, hagiographic, legends, in, which, the, huns, play, a, role, in, an, anonymous, medieval, biography, of, pope, leo, i, attila, s, march, into, italy, in, 452, is, stopped, because, when, he, meets, leo, outside, rome, the, apostles, peter, and, paul, appear, to, him, holding, swords, over, his, head, and, threatening, to, kill, him, unless, he, follows, the, pope, s, command, to, turn, back, in, other, versions, attila, takes, the, pope, hostage, and, is, forced, by, the, saints, to, release, him, in, the, legend, of, saint, ursula, ursula, and, her, 11, 000, holy, virgins, arrive, at, cologne, on, their, way, back, from, a, pilgrimage, just, as, the, huns, under, an, unnamed, prince, are, besieging, the, city, ursula, and, her, virgins, are, killed, by, the, huns, with, arrows, after, they, refuse, the, huns, sexual, advances, afterwards, the, souls, of, the, slaughtered, virgins, form, a, heavenly, army, that, drives, away, the, huns, and, saves, cologne, other, cities, with, legends, regarding, the, huns, and, a, saint, include, orl, ans, troyes, dieuze, metz, modena, and, reims, in, legends, surrounding, saint, servatius, of, tongeren, dating, to, at, least, the, eighth, century, servatius, is, said, to, have, converted, attila, and, the, huns, to, christianity, before, they, later, became, apostates, and, returned, to, their, paganism, the, huns, also, play, an, important, role, in, germanic, heroic, legends, which, frequently, convey, versions, of, events, from, the, migration, period, and, were, originally, transmitted, orally, the, huns, and, attila, form, central, figures, in, the, two, most, widespread, germanic, legendary, cycles, that, of, the, nibelungs, and, of, dietrich, von, bern, the, historical, theoderic, the, great, the, nibelung, legend, particularly, as, recorded, in, the, old, norse, poetic, edda, and, v, lsunga, saga, as, well, as, in, the, german, nibelungenlied, connects, the, huns, and, attila, and, in, the, norse, tradition, attila, s, death, to, the, destruction, of, the, burgundian, kingdom, on, the, rhine, in, 437, in, the, legends, about, dietrich, von, bern, attila, and, the, huns, provide, dietrich, with, a, refuge, and, support, after, he, has, been, driven, from, his, kingdom, at, verona, memories, of, the, conflicts, between, the, goths, and, huns, in, eastern, europe, appear, to, be, maintained, in, the, old, english, poem, widsith, as, well, as, in, the, old, norse, poem, the, battle, of, the, goths, and, huns, which, is, transmitted, in, the, thirteenth, century, icelandic, hervarar, saga, generally, the, continental, germanic, traditions, paint, a, more, positive, picture, of, attila, and, the, huns, than, the, scandinavian, sources, where, the, huns, appear, in, a, distinctly, negative, light, in, medieval, german, legend, the, huns, were, identified, with, the, hungarians, with, their, capital, of, etzelburg, attila, city, being, identified, with, esztergom, or, buda, the, old, norse, thidrekssaga, however, which, is, based, on, north, german, sources, locates, hunaland, in, northern, germany, with, a, capital, at, soest, in, westphalia, in, other, old, norse, sources, the, term, hun, is, sometimes, applied, indiscriminately, to, various, people, particularly, from, south, of, scandinavia, from, the, thirteenth, century, onward, the, middle, high, german, word, for, hun, hiune, became, a, synonym, for, giant, and, continued, to, be, used, in, this, meaning, in, the, forms, h, ne, and, heune, into, the, modern, era, in, this, way, various, prehistoric, megalithic, structures, particularly, in, northern, germany, came, to, be, identified, as, h, nengr, ber, hun, graves, or, h, nenbetten, hun, beds, beginning, in, the, high, middle, ages, hungarian, sources, have, claimed, descent, from, or, a, close, relationship, between, the, hungarians, magyars, and, the, huns, the, claim, appears, to, have, first, arisen, in, non, hungarian, sources, and, only, gradually, been, taken, up, by, the, hungarians, themselves, because, of, its, negative, connotations, the, anonymous, gesta, hungarorum, after, 1200, is, the, first, hungarian, source, to, mention, that, the, line, of, rp, dian, kings, were, descendants, of, attila, but, he, makes, no, claim, that, the, hungarian, and, hun, peoples, are, related, the, first, hungarian, author, to, claim, that, hun, and, hungarian, peoples, were, related, was, simon, of, k, za, in, his, gesta, hunnorum, et, hungarorum, 1282, 1285, simon, claimed, that, the, huns, and, hungarians, were, descended, from, two, brothers, named, hunor, and, magor, these, claims, gave, the, hungarians, an, ancient, pedigree, and, served, to, legitimize, their, conquest, of, pannonia, modern, scholars, largely, dismiss, these, claims, regarding, the, claimed, hunnish, origins, found, in, these, chronicles, jen, sz, cs, writes, the, hunnish, origin, of, the, magyars, is, of, course, a, fiction, just, like, the, trojan, origin, of, the, french, or, any, of, the, other, origo, gentis, theories, fabricated, at, much, the, same, time, the, magyars, in, fact, originated, from, the, ugrian, branch, of, the, finno, ugrian, peoples, in, the, course, of, their, wanderings, in, the, steppes, of, eastern, europe, they, assimilated, a, variety, of, especially, iranian, and, different, turkic, cultural, and, ethnic, elements, but, they, had, neither, genetic, nor, historical, links, to, the, huns, generally, the, proof, of, the, relationship, between, the, hungarian, and, the, finno, ugric, languages, in, the, nineteenth, century, is, taken, to, have, scientifically, disproven, the, hunnic, origins, of, the, hungarians, while, the, magyars, may, not, be, descendants, of, the, huns, they, were, historically, closely, associated, with, turkic, peoples, hyun, jin, kim, supposes, that, the, hungarians, might, be, linked, to, the, huns, via, the, bulgars, and, avars, both, of, whom, he, holds, to, have, had, hunnish, elements, another, claim, also, derived, from, simon, of, k, za, is, that, the, hungarian, speaking, sz, kely, people, of, transylvania, are, descended, from, huns, who, fled, to, transylvania, after, attila, s, death, and, remained, there, until, the, hungarian, conquest, of, pannonia, while, the, origins, of, the, sz, kely, are, unclear, modern, historians, and, archaeologists, do, not, consider, the, sz, kelys, to, be, of, hunnic, origin, due, to, a, lack, of, evidence, l, szl, makkai, notes, as, well, that, some, archaeologists, and, historians, believe, sz, kelys, were, a, hungarian, tribe, or, an, onogur, bulgar, tribe, drawn, into, the, carpathian, basin, at, the, end, of, the, 7th, century, by, the, avars, who, were, identified, with, the, huns, by, contemporary, europeans, unlike, in, the, legend, the, sz, kely, were, resettled, in, transylvania, from, western, hungary, in, the, eleventh, century, their, language, similarly, shows, no, evidence, of, a, change, from, any, non, hungarian, language, to, hungarian, as, one, would, expect, if, they, were, huns, while, the, notion, that, the, hungarians, are, descended, from, the, huns, has, been, rejected, by, mainstream, scholarship, the, idea, has, continued, to, exert, a, relevant, influence, on, hungarian, nationalism, and, national, identity, a, majority, of, the, hungarian, aristocracy, continued, to, ascribe, to, the, hunnic, view, into, the, early, twentieth, century, the, fascist, arrow, cross, party, similarly, referred, to, hungary, as, hunnia, in, its, propaganda, the, supposed, hunnic, origins, of, the, hungarians, also, played, a, large, role, in, the, modern, radical, right, wing, party, jobbik, s, ideology, of, pan, turanism, legends, concerning, the, hunnic, origins, of, the, sz, kely, minority, in, romania, meanwhile, continue, to, play, a, large, role, in, that, group, s, ethnic, identity, members, of, the, hungarian, right, wing, with, the, support, of, the, government, of, prime, minister, victor, orb, n, and, academic, institutions, such, as, the, institute, of, hungarian, research, magyars, gkutat, int, zet, mki, continue, to, promote, hungarian, descent, from, the, huns, modern, culture, generally, associates, the, huns, with, extreme, cruelty, and, barbarism, during, the, first, world, war, allied, propaganda, often, called, the, germans, huns, in, order, to, paint, the, germans, as, savage, barbarians, this, usage, continued, to, a, limited, extent, during, the, second, world, war, as, well
