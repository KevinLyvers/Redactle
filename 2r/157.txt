assyria, neo, assyrian, cuneiform, m, t, a, ur, was, a, major, ancient, mesopotamian, civilization, which, existed, as, a, city, state, from, the, 21st, century, bc, to, the, 14th, century, bc, which, eventually, expanded, into, an, empire, from, the, 14th, century, bc, to, the, 7th, century, bc, spanning, from, the, early, bronze, age, to, the, late, iron, age, modern, historians, typically, divide, ancient, assyrian, history, into, the, early, assyrian, c, 2600, 2025, bc, old, assyrian, c, 2025, 1364, bc, middle, assyrian, c, 1363, 912, bc, neo, assyrian, 911, 609, bc, and, post, imperial, 609, bc, c, ad, 240, periods, based, on, political, events, and, gradual, changes, in, language, assur, the, first, assyrian, capital, was, founded, c, 2600, bc, but, there, is, no, evidence, that, the, city, was, independent, until, the, collapse, of, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, in, the, 21st, century, bc, when, a, line, of, independent, kings, beginning, with, puzur, ashur, i, began, ruling, the, city, centered, in, the, assyrian, heartland, in, northern, mesopotamia, assyrian, power, fluctuated, over, time, the, city, underwent, several, periods, of, foreign, rule, or, domination, before, assyria, rose, under, ashur, uballit, i, in, the, early, 14th, century, bc, as, the, middle, assyrian, empire, in, the, middle, and, neo, assyrian, periods, assyria, was, one, of, the, two, major, mesopotamian, kingdoms, alongside, babylonia, in, the, south, and, at, times, became, the, dominant, power, in, the, ancient, near, east, assyria, was, at, its, strongest, in, the, neo, assyrian, period, when, the, assyrian, army, was, the, strongest, military, power, in, the, world, and, the, assyrians, ruled, the, largest, empire, then, yet, assembled, in, world, history, spanning, from, parts, of, modern, day, iran, in, the, east, to, egypt, in, the, west, the, neo, assyrian, empire, fell, in, the, late, 7th, century, bc, conquered, by, a, coalition, of, the, babylonians, who, had, lived, under, assyrian, rule, for, about, a, century, and, the, medes, though, the, core, urban, territory, of, assyria, was, extensively, devastated, in, the, medo, babylonian, conquest, of, the, assyrian, empire, and, the, succeeding, neo, babylonian, empire, invested, few, resources, in, rebuilding, it, ancient, assyrian, culture, and, traditions, continued, to, survive, for, centuries, throughout, the, post, imperial, period, assyria, experienced, a, recovery, under, the, seleucid, and, parthian, empires, though, declined, again, under, the, sasanian, empire, which, sacked, numerous, cities, and, semi, independent, assyrian, territories, in, the, region, including, assur, itself, the, remaining, assyrian, people, who, have, survived, in, northern, mesopotamia, to, modern, times, were, gradually, christianized, from, the, 1st, century, ad, onward, ancient, mesopotamian, religion, persisted, at, assur, until, its, final, sack, in, the, 3rd, century, ad, and, at, certain, other, holdouts, for, centuries, thereafter, the, triumph, of, ancient, assyria, can, be, attributed, not, only, to, its, vigorous, warrior, monarchs, but, also, to, its, adeptness, in, efficiently, assimilating, and, governing, conquered, territories, using, inventive, and, advanced, administrative, mechanisms, the, developments, in, warfare, and, governance, introduced, by, ancient, assyria, continued, to, be, employed, by, subsequent, empires, and, states, for, centuries, ancient, assyria, also, left, a, legacy, of, great, cultural, significance, particularly, through, the, neo, assyrian, empire, making, a, prominent, impression, in, later, assyrian, greco, roman, and, hebrew, literary, and, religious, tradition, in, the, old, assyrian, period, when, assyria, was, merely, a, city, state, centered, on, the, city, of, assur, the, state, was, typically, referred, to, as, lu, a, ur, city, of, ashur, from, the, time, of, its, rise, as, a, territorial, state, in, the, 14th, century, bc, and, onward, assyria, was, referred, to, in, official, documents, as, m, t, a, ur, land, of, ashur, marking, its, shift, to, being, a, regional, polity, the, first, attested, use, of, the, term, m, t, a, ur, is, during, the, reign, of, ashur, uballit, i, c, 1363, 1328, bc, who, was, the, first, king, of, the, middle, assyrian, empire, both, lu, a, ur, and, m, t, a, ur, derive, from, the, name, of, the, assyrian, national, deity, ashur, ashur, probably, originated, in, the, early, assyrian, period, as, a, deified, personification, of, assur, itself, in, the, old, assyrian, period, the, deity, was, considered, the, formal, king, of, assur, the, actual, rulers, only, used, the, style, i, i, ak, governor, from, the, time, of, assyria, s, rise, as, a, territorial, state, ashur, began, to, be, regarded, as, an, embodiment, of, the, entire, land, ruled, by, the, assyrian, kings, the, modern, name, assyria, is, of, greek, origin, derived, from, assur, a, the, term, s, first, attested, use, is, during, the, time, of, the, ancient, greek, historian, herodotus, 5th, century, bc, the, greeks, called, the, levant, syria, and, mesopotamia, assyria, even, though, the, local, population, both, at, that, time, and, well, into, the, later, christian, period, used, both, terms, interchangeably, to, refer, to, the, entire, region, it, is, not, known, whether, the, greeks, began, referring, to, mesopotamia, as, assyria, because, they, equated, the, region, with, the, assyrian, empire, long, fallen, by, the, time, the, term, is, first, attested, or, because, they, named, the, region, after, the, people, who, lived, there, the, assyrians, because, the, term, is, so, similar, to, syria, scholars, have, been, examining, since, the, 17th, century, whether, the, two, terms, are, connected, and, because, in, sources, predating, the, greek, ones, the, shortened, form, syria, is, attested, as, a, synonym, for, assyria, notably, in, luwian, and, aramaic, texts, from, the, time, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, modern, scholars, overwhelmingly, support, the, conclusion, that, the, names, are, connected, both, assyria, and, the, contraction, syria, are, ultimately, derived, from, the, akkadian, a, ur, following, the, decline, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, the, subsequent, empires, that, held, dominion, over, the, assyrian, lands, adopted, distinct, appellations, for, the, region, with, a, significant, portion, of, these, names, also, being, rooted, in, a, ur, the, achaemenid, empire, referred, to, assyria, as, a, r, athura, the, sasanian, empire, inexplicably, referred, to, lower, mesopotamia, as, asoristan, land, of, the, assyrians, though, the, northern, province, of, n, d, rag, n, which, included, much, of, the, old, assyrian, heartland, was, also, sometimes, called, at, ria, or, th, r, in, syriac, assyria, was, and, is, referred, to, as, thor, agricultural, villages, in, the, region, that, would, later, become, assyria, are, known, to, have, existed, by, the, time, of, the, hassuna, culture, c, 6300, 5800, bc, though, the, sites, of, some, nearby, cities, that, would, later, be, incorporated, into, the, assyrian, heartland, such, as, nineveh, are, known, to, have, been, inhabited, since, the, neolithic, the, earliest, archaeological, evidence, from, assur, dates, to, the, early, dynastic, period, c, 2600, bc, during, this, time, the, surrounding, region, was, already, relatively, urbanized, there, is, no, evidence, that, early, assur, was, an, independent, settlement, and, it, might, not, have, been, called, assur, at, all, initially, but, rather, baltil, or, baltila, used, in, later, times, to, refer, to, the, city, s, oldest, portion, the, name, assur, is, first, attested, for, the, site, in, documents, of, the, akkadian, period, in, the, 24th, century, bc, through, most, of, the, early, assyrian, period, c, 2600, 2025, bc, assur, was, dominated, by, states, and, polities, from, southern, mesopotamia, early, on, assur, for, a, time, fell, under, the, loose, hegemony, of, the, sumerian, city, of, kish, and, it, was, later, occupied, by, both, the, akkadian, empire, and, then, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, in, c, 2025, bc, due, to, the, collapse, of, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, assur, became, an, independent, city, state, under, puzur, ashur, i, assur, was, under, the, puzur, ashur, dynasty, home, to, less, than, 10, 000, people, and, likely, held, very, limited, military, power, no, military, institutions, at, all, are, known, from, this, time, and, no, political, influence, was, exerted, on, neighboring, cities, the, city, was, still, influential, in, other, ways, under, erishum, i, r, c, 1974, 1934, bc, assur, experimented, with, free, trade, the, earliest, known, such, experiment, in, world, history, which, left, the, initiative, for, trade, and, large, scale, foreign, transactions, entirely, to, the, populace, rather, than, the, state, royal, encouragement, of, trade, led, to, assur, quickly, establishing, itself, as, a, prominent, trading, city, in, northern, mesopotamia, and, soon, thereafter, establishing, an, extensive, long, distance, trade, network, the, first, notable, impression, assyria, left, in, the, historical, record, among, the, evidence, left, from, this, trade, network, are, large, collections, of, old, assyrian, cuneiform, tablets, from, assyrian, trade, colonies, the, most, notable, of, which, is, a, set, of, 22, 000, clay, tablets, found, at, k, ltepe, near, the, modern, city, of, kayseri, in, turkey, as, trade, declined, perhaps, due, to, increased, warfare, and, conflict, between, the, growing, states, of, the, near, east, assur, was, frequently, threatened, by, larger, foreign, states, and, kingdoms, the, original, assur, city, state, and, the, puzur, ashur, dynasty, came, to, an, end, c, 1808, bc, when, the, city, was, conquered, by, the, amorite, ruler, of, ekallatum, shamshi, adad, i, shamshi, adad, s, extensive, conquests, in, northern, mesopotamia, eventually, made, him, the, ruler, of, the, entire, region, founding, what, some, scholars, have, termed, the, kingdom, of, upper, mesopotamia, the, survival, of, this, realm, relied, chiefly, on, shamshi, adad, s, own, strength, and, charisma, and, it, thus, collapsed, shortly, after, his, death, c, 1776, bc, after, shamshi, adad, s, death, the, political, situation, in, northern, mesopotamia, was, highly, volatile, with, assur, at, times, coming, under, the, brief, control, of, eshnunna, elam, and, the, old, babylonian, empire, at, some, point, the, city, returned, to, being, an, independent, city, state, though, the, politics, of, assur, itself, were, volatile, as, well, with, fighting, between, members, of, shamshi, adad, s, dynasty, native, assyrians, and, hurrians, for, control, the, infighting, came, to, an, end, after, the, rise, of, bel, bani, as, king, c, 1700, bc, bel, bani, founded, the, adaside, dynasty, which, after, his, reign, ruled, assyria, for, about, a, thousand, years, assyria, s, rise, as, a, territorial, state, in, later, times, was, in, large, part, facilitated, by, two, separate, invasions, of, mesopotamia, by, the, hittites, an, invasion, by, the, hittite, king, mursili, i, in, c, 1595, bc, destroyed, the, dominant, old, babylonian, empire, allowing, the, smaller, kingdoms, of, mitanni, and, kassite, babylonia, to, rise, in, the, north, and, south, respectively, around, c, 1430, bc, assur, was, subjugated, by, mitanni, an, arrangement, that, lasted, for, about, 70, years, until, c, 1360, bc, another, hittite, invasion, by, uppiluliuma, i, in, the, 14th, century, bc, effectively, crippled, the, mitanni, kingdom, after, his, invasion, assyria, succeeded, in, freeing, itself, from, its, suzerain, achieving, independence, once, more, under, ashur, uballit, i, r, c, 1363, 1328, bc, whose, rise, to, power, independence, and, conquests, of, neighboring, territory, traditionally, marks, the, rise, of, the, middle, assyrian, empire, c, 1363, 912, bc, ashur, uballit, i, was, the, first, native, assyrian, ruler, to, claim, the, royal, title, ar, king, shortly, after, achieving, independence, he, further, claimed, the, dignity, of, a, great, king, on, the, level, of, the, egyptian, pharaohs, and, the, hittite, kings, assyria, s, rise, was, intertwined, with, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, mitanni, kingdom, its, former, suzerain, which, allowed, the, early, middle, assyrian, kings, to, expand, and, consolidate, territories, in, northern, mesopotamia, under, the, warrior, kings, adad, nirari, i, r, c, 1305, 1274, bc, shalmaneser, i, r, c, 1273, 1244, bc, and, tukulti, ninurta, i, r, c, 1243, 1207, bc, assyria, began, to, realize, its, aspirations, of, becoming, a, significant, regional, power, these, kings, campaigned, in, all, directions, and, incorporated, a, significant, amount, of, territory, into, the, growing, assyrian, empire, under, shalmaneser, i, the, last, remnants, of, the, mitanni, kingdom, were, formally, annexed, into, assyria, the, most, successful, of, the, middle, assyrian, kings, was, tukulti, ninurta, i, who, brought, the, middle, assyrian, empire, to, its, greatest, extent, his, most, notable, military, achievements, were, his, victory, at, the, battle, of, nihriya, c, 1237, bc, which, marked, the, beginning, of, the, end, of, hittite, influence, in, northern, mesopotamia, and, his, temporary, conquest, of, babylonia, which, became, an, assyrian, vassal, c, 1225, 1216, bc, tukulti, ninurta, was, also, the, first, assyrian, king, to, try, to, move, the, capital, away, from, assur, inaugurating, the, new, city, kar, tukulti, ninurta, as, capital, c, 1233, bc, the, capital, was, returned, to, assur, after, his, death, tukulti, ninurta, i, s, assassination, c, 1207, bc, was, followed, by, inter, dynastic, conflict, and, a, significant, drop, in, assyrian, power, tukulti, ninurta, i, s, successors, were, unable, to, maintain, assyrian, power, and, assyria, became, increasingly, restricted, to, just, the, assyrian, heartland, a, period, of, decline, broadly, coinciding, with, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, though, some, kings, in, this, period, of, decline, such, as, ashur, dan, i, r, c, 1178, 1133, bc, ashur, resh, ishi, i, r, 1132, 1115, bc, and, tiglath, pileser, i, r, 1114, 1076, bc, worked, to, reverse, the, decline, and, made, significant, conquests, their, conquests, were, ephemeral, and, shaky, quickly, lost, again, from, the, time, of, eriba, adad, ii, r, 1056, 1054, bc, onward, assyrian, decline, intensified, the, assyrian, heartland, remained, safe, since, it, was, protected, by, its, geographical, remoteness, since, assyria, was, not, the, only, state, to, undergo, decline, during, these, centuries, and, the, lands, surrounding, the, assyrian, heartland, were, also, significantly, fragmented, it, would, ultimately, be, relatively, easy, for, the, reinvigorated, assyrian, army, to, reconquer, large, parts, of, the, empire, under, ashur, dan, ii, r, 934, 912, bc, who, campaigned, in, the, northeast, and, northwest, assyrian, decline, was, at, last, reversed, paving, the, way, for, grander, efforts, under, his, successors, the, end, of, his, reign, conventionally, marks, the, beginning, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, 911, 609, bc, through, decades, of, conquests, the, early, neo, assyrian, kings, worked, to, retake, the, lands, of, the, middle, assyrian, empire, since, this, reconquista, had, to, begin, nearly, from, scratch, its, eventual, success, was, an, extraordinary, achievement, under, ashurnasirpal, ii, r, 883, 859, bc, the, neo, assyrian, empire, became, the, dominant, political, power, in, the, near, east, in, his, ninth, campaign, ashurnasirpal, ii, marched, to, the, coast, of, the, mediterranean, sea, collecting, tribute, from, various, kingdoms, on, the, way, a, significant, development, during, ashurnasirpal, ii, s, reign, was, the, second, attempt, to, transfer, the, assyrian, capital, away, from, assur, ashurnasirpal, restored, the, ancient, and, ruined, town, of, nimrud, also, located, in, the, assyrian, heartland, and, in, 879, bc, designated, that, city, as, the, new, capital, of, the, empire, though, no, longer, the, political, capital, assur, remained, the, ceremonial, and, religious, center, of, assyria, ashurnasirpal, ii, s, son, shalmaneser, iii, r, 859, 824, bc, also, went, on, wide, ranging, wars, of, conquest, expanding, the, empire, in, all, directions, after, shalmaneser, iii, s, death, the, neo, assyrian, empire, entered, into, a, period, of, stagnation, dubbed, the, age, of, the, magnates, when, powerful, officials, and, generals, were, the, principal, wielders, of, political, power, rather, than, the, king, this, time, of, stagnation, came, to, an, end, with, the, rise, of, tiglath, pileser, iii, r, 745, 727, bc, who, reduced, the, power, of, the, magnates, consolidated, and, centralized, the, holdings, of, the, empire, and, through, his, military, campaigns, and, conquests, more, than, doubled, the, extent, of, assyrian, territory, the, most, significant, conquests, were, the, vassalization, of, the, levant, all, the, way, to, the, egyptian, border, and, the, 729, bc, conquest, of, babylonia, the, neo, assyrian, empire, reached, the, height, of, its, extent, and, power, under, the, sargonid, dynasty, founded, by, sargon, ii, r, 722, 705, bc, under, sargon, ii, and, his, son, sennacherib, r, 705, 681, bc, the, empire, was, further, expanded, and, the, gains, were, consolidated, both, kings, founded, new, capitals, sargon, ii, moved, the, capital, to, the, new, city, of, dur, sharrukin, in, 706, bc, and, the, year, after, sennacherib, transferred, the, capital, to, nineveh, which, he, ambitiously, expanded, and, renovated, and, might, even, have, built, the, hanging, gardens, there, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, the, 671, bc, conquest, of, egypt, under, esarhaddon, r, 681, 669, bc, brought, assyria, to, its, greatest, ever, extent, after, the, death, of, ashurbanipal, r, 669, 631, bc, the, neo, assyrian, empire, swiftly, collapsed, one, of, the, primary, reasons, was, the, inability, of, the, neo, assyrian, kings, to, resolve, the, babylonian, problem, despite, many, attempts, to, appease, babylonia, in, the, south, revolts, were, frequent, all, throughout, the, sargonid, period, the, revolt, of, babylon, under, nabopolassar, in, 626, bc, in, combination, with, an, invasion, by, the, medes, under, cyaxares, in, 615, 614, bc, led, to, the, medo, babylonian, conquest, of, the, assyrian, empire, assur, was, sacked, in, 614, bc, and, nineveh, fell, in, 612, bc, the, last, assyrian, ruler, ashur, uballit, ii, tried, to, rally, the, assyrian, army, at, harran, in, the, west, but, he, was, defeated, in, 609, bc, marking, the, end, of, the, ancient, line, of, assyrian, kings, and, of, assyria, as, a, state, despite, the, violent, downfall, of, the, assyrian, empire, assyrian, culture, continued, to, survive, through, the, subsequent, post, imperial, period, 609, bc, c, ad, 240, and, beyond, the, assyrian, heartland, experienced, a, dramatic, decrease, in, the, size, and, number, of, inhabited, settlements, during, the, rule, of, the, neo, babylonian, empire, founded, by, nabopolassar, the, former, assyrian, capital, cities, assur, nimrud, and, nineveh, were, nearly, completely, abandoned, throughout, the, time, of, the, neo, babylonian, and, later, achaemenid, empire, assyria, remained, a, marginal, and, sparsely, populated, region, toward, the, end, of, the, 6th, century, bc, the, assyrian, dialect, of, the, akkadian, language, went, extinct, having, toward, the, end, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, already, largely, been, replaced, by, aramaic, as, a, vernacular, language, under, the, empires, succeeding, the, neo, babylonians, from, the, late, 6th, century, bc, onward, assyria, began, to, experience, a, recovery, under, the, achaemenids, most, of, the, territory, was, organized, into, the, province, athura, a, r, the, organization, into, a, single, large, province, the, lack, of, interference, of, the, achaemenid, rulers, in, local, affairs, and, the, return, of, the, cult, statue, of, ashur, to, assur, soon, after, the, achaemenids, conquered, babylon, facilitated, the, survival, of, assyrian, culture, under, the, seleucid, empire, which, controlled, mesopotamia, from, the, late, 4th, to, mid, 2nd, century, bc, assyrian, sites, such, as, assur, nimrud, and, nineveh, were, resettled, and, a, large, number, of, villages, were, rebuilt, and, expanded, after, the, parthian, empire, conquered, the, region, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, the, recovery, of, assyria, continued, culminating, in, an, unprecedented, return, to, prosperity, and, revival, in, the, 1st, to, 3rd, centuries, ad, the, region, was, resettled, and, restored, so, intensely, that, the, population, and, settlement, density, reached, heights, not, seen, since, the, neo, assyrian, empire, the, region, was, under, the, parthians, primarily, ruled, by, a, group, of, vassal, kingdoms, including, osroene, adiabene, and, hatra, though, in, some, aspects, influenced, by, assyrian, culture, these, states, were, for, the, most, part, not, ruled, by, assyrian, rulers, assur, itself, flourished, under, parthian, rule, from, around, or, shortly, after, the, end, of, the, 2nd, century, bc, the, city, may, have, become, the, capital, of, its, own, small, semi, autonomous, assyrian, realm, either, under, the, suzerainty, of, hatra, or, under, direct, parthian, suzerainty, on, account, of, the, resemblance, between, the, stelae, by, the, local, rulers, and, those, of, the, ancient, assyrian, kings, they, may, have, seen, themselves, as, the, restorers, and, continuators, of, the, old, royal, line, the, ancient, ashur, temple, was, restored, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, this, last, cultural, golden, age, came, to, an, end, with, the, sack, of, assur, by, the, sasanian, empire, c, 240, during, the, sack, the, ashur, temple, was, destroyed, again, and, the, city, s, population, was, dispersed, starting, from, the, 1st, century, ad, onward, many, of, the, assyrians, became, christianized, though, holdouts, of, the, old, ancient, mesopotamian, religion, continued, to, survive, for, centuries, despite, the, loss, of, political, power, the, assyrians, continued, to, constitute, a, significant, portion, of, the, population, in, northern, mesopotamia, until, religiously, motivated, suppression, and, massacres, under, the, ilkhanate, and, the, timurid, empire, in, the, 14th, century, which, relegated, them, to, a, local, ethnic, and, religious, minority, the, assyrians, lived, largely, in, peace, under, the, rule, of, the, ottoman, empire, which, gained, control, of, assyria, in, 16th, century, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, when, the, ottomans, grew, increasingly, nationalistic, further, persecutions, and, massacres, were, enacted, against, the, assyrians, most, notably, the, sayfo, assyrian, genocide, which, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, as, many, as, 250, 000, assyrians, throughout, the, 20th, century, many, unsuccessful, proposals, have, been, made, by, the, assyrians, for, autonomy, or, independence, further, massacres, and, persecutions, enacted, both, by, governments, and, by, terrorist, groups, such, as, the, islamic, state, have, resulted, in, most, of, the, assyrian, people, living, in, diaspora, in, the, assur, city, state, of, the, old, assyrian, period, the, government, was, in, many, respects, an, oligarchy, where, the, king, was, a, permanent, albeit, not, the, only, prominent, actor, the, old, assyrian, kings, were, not, autocrats, with, sole, power, but, rather, acted, as, stewards, on, behalf, of, the, god, ashur, and, presided, over, the, meetings, of, the, city, assembly, the, main, assyrian, administrative, body, during, this, time, the, composition, of, the, city, assembly, is, not, known, but, it, is, generally, believed, to, have, been, made, up, of, members, of, the, most, powerful, families, of, the, city, many, of, whom, were, merchants, the, king, acted, as, the, main, executive, officer, and, chairman, of, this, group, of, influential, individuals, and, also, contributed, with, legal, knowledge, and, expertise, the, old, assyrian, kings, were, styled, as, i, iak, a, ur, governor, of, ashur, with, ashur, being, considered, the, city, s, formal, king, that, the, populace, of, assur, in, the, old, assyrian, period, often, referred, to, the, king, as, rub, um, great, one, clearly, indicates, that, the, kings, despite, their, limited, executive, power, were, seen, as, royal, figures, and, as, being, primus, inter, pares, first, among, equals, among, the, powerful, individuals, of, the, city, assur, first, experienced, a, more, autocratic, form, of, kingship, under, the, amorite, conqueror, shamshi, adad, i, the, earliest, ruler, of, assur, to, use, the, style, arrum, king, and, the, title, king, of, the, universe, shamshi, adad, i, appears, to, have, based, his, more, absolute, form, of, kingship, on, the, rulers, of, the, old, babylonian, empire, under, shamshi, adad, i, assyrians, also, swore, their, oaths, by, the, king, not, just, by, the, god, this, practice, did, not, survive, beyond, his, death, the, influence, of, the, city, assembly, had, disappeared, by, the, beginning, of, the, middle, assyrian, period, though, the, traditional, i, iak, a, ur, continued, to, be, used, at, times, the, middle, assyrian, kings, were, autocrats, in, terms, of, power, having, little, in, common, with, the, rulers, of, the, old, assyrian, period, as, the, assyrian, empire, grew, the, kings, began, to, employ, an, increasingly, sophisticated, array, of, royal, titles, ashur, uballit, i, was, the, first, to, assume, the, style, ar, m, t, a, ur, king, of, the, land, of, ashur, and, his, grandson, arik, den, ili, r, c, 1317, 1306, bc, introduced, the, style, arru, dannu, strong, king, adad, nirari, i, s, inscriptions, required, 32, lines, to, be, devoted, just, to, his, titles, this, development, peaked, under, tukulti, ninurta, i, who, assumed, among, other, titles, the, styles, king, of, assyria, and, karduniash, king, of, sumer, and, akkad, king, of, the, upper, and, the, lower, seas, and, king, of, all, peoples, royal, titles, and, epithets, were, often, highly, reflective, of, current, political, developments, and, the, achievements, of, individual, kings, during, periods, of, decline, the, royal, titles, used, typically, grew, more, simple, again, only, to, grow, grander, once, more, as, assyrian, power, experienced, resurgences, the, kings, of, the, middle, and, neo, assyrian, periods, continued, to, present, themselves, and, be, viewed, by, their, subjects, as, the, intermediaries, between, ashur, and, mankind, this, position, and, role, was, used, to, justify, imperial, expansion, the, assyrians, saw, their, empire, as, being, the, part, of, the, world, overseen, and, administered, by, ashur, through, his, human, agents, in, their, ideology, the, outer, realm, outside, of, assyria, was, characterized, by, chaos, and, the, people, there, were, uncivilized, with, unfamiliar, cultural, practices, and, strange, languages, the, mere, existence, of, the, outer, realm, was, regarded, as, a, threat, to, the, cosmic, order, within, assyria, and, as, such, it, was, the, king, s, duty, to, expand, the, realm, of, ashur, and, incorporate, these, strange, lands, converting, chaos, to, civilization, texts, describing, the, coronation, of, middle, and, neo, assyrian, kings, at, times, include, ashur, commanding, the, king, to, broaden, the, land, of, ashur, or, extend, the, land, at, his, feet, as, such, expansion, was, cast, as, a, moral, and, necessary, duty, because, the, rule, and, actions, of, the, assyrian, king, were, seen, as, divinely, sanctioned, resistance, to, assyrian, sovereignty, in, times, of, war, was, regarded, to, be, resistance, against, divine, will, which, deserved, punishment, peoples, and, polities, who, revolted, against, assyria, were, seen, as, criminals, against, the, divine, world, order, since, ashur, was, the, king, of, the, gods, all, other, gods, were, subjected, to, him, and, thus, the, people, who, followed, those, gods, should, be, subjected, to, the, representative, of, ashur, the, assyrian, king, the, kings, also, had, religious, and, judicial, duties, kings, were, responsible, for, performing, various, rituals, in, support, of, the, cult, of, ashur, and, the, assyrian, priesthood, they, were, expected, together, with, the, assyrian, people, to, provide, offerings, to, not, only, ashur, but, also, all, the, other, gods, from, the, time, of, ashur, resh, ishi, i, onward, the, religious, and, cultic, duties, of, the, king, were, pushed, somewhat, into, the, background, though, they, were, still, prominently, mentioned, in, accounts, of, building, and, restoring, temples, assyrian, titles, and, epithets, in, inscriptions, from, then, on, generally, emphasized, the, kings, as, powerful, warriors, developing, from, their, role, in, the, old, assyrian, period, the, middle, and, neo, assyrian, kings, were, the, supreme, judicial, authority, in, the, empire, though, they, generally, appear, to, have, been, less, concerned, with, their, role, as, judges, than, their, predecessors, in, the, old, assyrian, period, were, the, kings, were, expected, to, ensure, the, welfare, and, prosperity, of, the, assyria, and, its, people, indicated, by, multiple, inscriptions, referring, to, the, kings, as, shepherds, re, no, word, for, the, idea, of, a, capital, city, existed, in, akkadian, the, nearest, being, the, idea, of, a, city, of, kingship, i, e, an, administrative, center, used, by, the, king, but, there, are, several, examples, of, kingdoms, having, multiple, cities, of, kingship, due, to, assyria, growing, out, of, the, assur, city, state, of, the, old, assyrian, period, and, due, to, the, city, s, religious, importance, assur, was, the, administrative, center, of, assyria, through, most, of, its, history, though, the, royal, administration, at, times, moved, elsewhere, the, ideological, status, of, assur, was, never, fully, superseded, and, it, remained, a, ceremonial, center, in, the, empire, even, when, it, was, governed, from, elsewhere, the, transfer, of, the, royal, seat, of, power, to, other, cities, was, ideologically, possible, since, the, king, was, ashur, s, representative, on, earth, the, king, like, the, deity, embodied, assyria, itself, and, so, the, capital, of, assyria, was, in, a, sense, wherever, the, king, happened, to, have, his, residence, the, first, transfer, of, administrative, power, away, from, assur, occurred, under, tukulti, ninurta, i, who, c, 1233, bc, inaugurated, kar, tukulti, ninurta, as, capital, tukulti, ninurta, i, s, foundation, of, a, new, capital, was, perhaps, inspired, by, developments, in, babylonia, in, the, south, where, the, kassite, dynasty, had, transferred, the, administration, from, the, long, established, city, of, babylon, to, the, newly, constructed, city, of, dur, kurigalzu, also, named, after, a, king, it, seems, that, tukulti, ninurta, i, intended, to, go, further, than, the, kassites, and, also, establish, kar, tukulti, ninurta, as, the, new, assyrian, cult, center, the, city, was, however, not, maintained, as, capital, after, tukulti, ninurta, i, s, death, with, subsequent, kings, once, more, ruling, from, assur, the, neo, assyrian, empire, underwent, several, different, capitals, there, is, some, evidence, that, tukulti, ninurta, ii, r, 890, 884, bc, perhaps, inspired, by, his, predecessor, of, the, same, name, made, unfulfilled, plans, to, transfer, the, capital, to, a, city, called, nemid, tukulti, ninurta, either, a, completely, new, city, or, a, new, name, applied, to, nineveh, which, by, this, point, already, rivalled, assur, in, scale, and, political, importance, the, capital, was, transferred, under, tukulti, ninurta, ii, s, son, ashurnasirpal, ii, to, nimrud, in, 879, bc, an, architectural, detail, separating, nimrud, and, the, other, neo, assyrian, capitals, from, assur, is, that, they, were, designed, in, a, way, that, emphasized, royal, power, the, royal, palaces, in, assur, were, smaller, than, the, temples, but, the, situation, was, reversed, in, the, new, capitals, sargon, ii, transferred, the, capital, in, 706, bc, to, the, city, dur, sharrukin, which, he, built, himself, since, the, location, of, dur, sharrukin, had, no, obvious, practical, or, political, merit, this, move, was, probably, an, ideological, statement, immediately, after, sargon, ii, s, death, in, 705, bc, his, son, sennacherib, transferred, the, capital, to, nineveh, a, far, more, natural, seat, of, power, though, it, was, not, meant, as, a, permanent, royal, residence, ashur, uballit, ii, chose, harran, as, his, seat, of, power, after, the, fall, of, nineveh, in, 612, bc, harran, is, typically, seen, as, the, short, lived, final, assyrian, capital, no, building, projects, were, conducted, during, this, time, but, harran, had, been, long, established, as, a, major, religious, center, dedicated, to, the, god, s, n, because, of, the, nature, of, source, preservation, more, information, about, the, upper, classes, of, ancient, assyria, survives, than, for, the, lower, ones, at, the, top, of, middle, and, neo, assyrian, society, were, members, of, long, established, and, large, families, called, houses, members, of, this, aristocracy, tended, to, occupy, the, most, important, offices, within, the, government, and, they, were, likely, descendants, of, the, most, prominent, families, of, the, old, assyrian, period, one, of, the, most, influential, offices, in, the, assyrian, administration, was, the, position, of, vizier, sukkallu, from, at, least, the, time, of, shalmaneser, i, onward, there, were, grand, viziers, sukkallu, rabi, u, superior, to, the, ordinary, viziers, who, at, times, governed, their, own, lands, as, appointees, of, the, kings, at, least, in, the, middle, assyrian, period, the, grand, viziers, were, typically, members, of, the, royal, family, and, the, position, was, at, this, time, as, were, many, other, offices, hereditary, the, elite, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, was, expanded, and, included, several, different, offices, the, neo, assyrian, inner, elite, is, typically, divided, by, modern, scholars, into, the, magnates, a, set, of, high, ranking, offices, and, the, scholars, umm, n, tasked, with, advising, and, guiding, the, kings, through, interpreting, omens, the, magnates, included, the, offices, masennu, treasurer, n, gir, ekalli, palace, herald, rab, q, chief, cupbearer, rab, a, r, i, chief, officer, eunuch, sartinnu, chief, judge, sukkallu, grand, vizier, and, turtanu, commander, in, chief, which, at, times, continued, to, be, occupied, by, royal, family, members, some, of, the, magnates, also, acted, as, governors, of, important, provinces, and, all, of, them, were, deeply, involved, with, the, assyrian, military, controlling, significant, forces, they, also, owned, large, tax, free, estates, scattered, throughout, the, empire, in, the, late, neo, assyrian, empire, there, was, a, growing, disconnect, between, the, traditional, assyrian, elite, and, the, kings, due, to, eunuchs, growing, unprecedently, powerful, the, highest, offices, both, in, the, civil, administration, and, the, army, began, to, be, occupied, by, eunuchs, with, deliberately, obscure, and, lowly, origins, since, this, ensured, that, they, would, be, loyal, to, the, king, eunuchs, were, trusted, since, they, were, believed, to, not, be, able, to, have, any, dynastic, aspirations, of, their, own, from, the, time, of, erishum, i, in, the, early, old, assyrian, period, onward, a, yearly, office, holder, a, limmu, official, was, elected, from, the, influential, men, of, assyria, the, limmu, official, gave, their, name, to, the, year, meaning, that, their, name, appeared, in, all, administrative, documents, signed, that, year, kings, were, typically, the, limmu, officials, in, their, first, regnal, years, in, the, old, assyrian, period, the, limmu, officials, also, held, substantial, executive, power, though, this, aspect, of, the, office, had, disappeared, by, the, time, of, the, rise, of, the, middle, assyrian, empire, the, success, of, assyria, was, not, only, due, to, energetic, kings, who, expanded, its, borders, but, more, importantly, due, to, its, ability, to, efficiently, incorporate, and, govern, conquered, lands, from, the, rise, of, assyria, as, a, territorial, state, at, the, beginning, of, the, middle, assyrian, period, onward, assyrian, territory, was, divided, into, a, set, of, provinces, or, districts, p, utu, the, total, number, and, size, of, these, provinces, varied, and, changed, as, assyria, expanded, and, contracted, every, province, was, headed, by, a, provincial, governor, bel, p, ete, b, l, p, h, ti, or, aknu, who, was, responsible, for, handling, local, order, public, safety, and, economy, governors, also, stored, and, distributed, the, goods, produced, in, their, province, which, were, inspected, and, collected, by, royal, representatives, once, a, year, through, these, inspections, the, central, government, could, keep, track, of, current, stocks, and, production, throughout, the, country, governors, had, to, pay, both, taxes, and, offer, gifts, to, the, god, ashur, though, such, gifts, were, usually, small, and, mainly, symbolic, the, channeling, of, taxes, and, gifts, were, not, only, a, method, of, collecting, profit, but, also, served, to, connect, the, elite, of, the, entire, empire, to, the, assyrian, heartland, in, the, neo, assyrian, period, an, extensive, hierarchy, within, the, provincial, administration, is, attested, at, the, bottom, of, this, hierarchy, were, lower, officials, such, as, village, managers, rab, l, ni, who, oversaw, one, or, more, villages, collecting, taxes, in, the, form, of, labor, and, goods, and, keeping, the, administration, informed, of, the, conditions, of, their, settlements, and, corv, e, officers, a, b, t, k, dini, who, kept, tallies, on, the, labor, performed, by, forced, laborers, and, the, remaining, time, owed, individual, cities, had, their, own, administrations, headed, by, mayors, azi, nu, responsible, for, the, local, economy, and, production, some, regions, of, the, assyrian, empire, were, not, incorporated, into, the, provincial, system, but, were, still, subjected, to, the, rule, of, the, assyrian, kings, such, vassal, states, could, be, ruled, indirectly, through, allowing, established, local, lines, of, kings, to, continue, ruling, in, exchange, for, tribute, or, through, the, assyrian, kings, appointing, their, own, vassal, rulers, through, the, ilku, system, the, assyrian, kings, could, also, grant, arable, lands, to, individuals, in, exchange, for, goods, and, military, service, to, overcome, the, challenges, of, governing, a, large, empire, the, neo, assyrian, empire, developed, a, sophisticated, state, communication, system, which, included, various, innovative, techniques, and, relay, stations, per, estimates, by, karen, radner, an, official, message, sent, in, the, neo, assyrian, period, from, the, western, border, province, quw, to, the, assyrian, heartland, a, distance, of, 700, kilometers, 430, miles, over, a, stretch, of, lands, featuring, many, rivers, without, any, bridges, could, take, less, than, five, days, to, arrive, such, communication, speed, was, unprecedented, before, the, rise, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, and, was, not, surpassed, in, the, middle, east, until, the, telegraph, was, introduced, by, the, ottoman, empire, in, 1865, nearly, two, and, a, half, thousand, years, after, the, neo, assyrian, empire, s, fall, the, assyrian, army, was, throughout, its, history, mostly, composed, of, levies, mobilized, only, when, they, were, needed, such, as, in, the, time, of, campaigns, through, regulations, obligations, and, sophisticated, government, systems, large, amounts, of, soldiers, could, be, recruited, and, mobilized, already, in, the, early, middle, assyrian, period, a, small, central, standing, army, unit, was, established, in, the, neo, assyrian, empire, dubbed, the, ki, ir, arri, king, s, unit, some, professional, though, not, standing, troops, are, also, attested, in, the, middle, assyrian, period, dubbed, ur, du, or, b, ur, d, tu, though, what, their, role, was, is, not, clear, due, to, the, scarcity, of, sources, perhaps, this, category, included, archers, and, charioteers, who, needed, more, extensive, training, than, normal, foot, soldiers, the, assyrian, army, developed, and, evolved, over, time, in, the, middle, assyrian, period, foot, soldiers, were, divided, into, the, s, b, a, kakk, weapon, troops, and, the, s, b, a, ar, t, shield, bearing, troops, but, surviving, records, are, not, detailed, enough, to, determine, what, the, differences, were, it, is, possible, that, the, s, b, a, kakk, included, ranged, troops, such, as, slingers, b, a, u, pe, and, archers, b, a, qalte, the, chariots, in, the, army, composed, a, unit, of, their, own, based, on, surviving, depictions, chariots, were, crewed, by, two, soldiers, an, archer, who, commanded, the, chariot, m, ru, damqu, and, a, driver, a, mugerre, chariots, first, entered, extensive, military, use, under, tiglath, pileser, i, in, the, 12th, 11th, centuries, bc, and, were, in, the, later, neo, assyrian, period, gradually, phased, out, in, favor, of, cavalry, a, pet, alle, in, the, middle, assyrian, period, cavalry, was, mainly, used, for, escorting, or, message, deliveries, under, the, neo, assyrian, empire, important, new, developments, in, the, military, were, the, large, scale, introduction, of, cavalry, the, adoption, of, iron, for, armor, and, weapons, and, the, development, of, new, and, innovative, siege, warfare, techniques, at, the, height, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, the, assyrian, army, was, the, strongest, army, yet, assembled, in, world, history, the, number, of, soldiers, in, the, neo, assyrian, army, was, likely, several, hundred, thousand, the, neo, assyrian, army, was, subdivided, into, ki, ru, composed, of, perhaps, 1, 000, soldiers, most, of, whom, would, have, been, infantry, soldiers, z, k, zukk, or, raks, te, the, infantry, was, divided, into, three, types, light, medium, and, heavy, with, varying, weapons, level, of, armor, and, responsibilities, while, on, campaign, the, assyrian, army, made, heavy, use, of, both, interpreters, translators, targumannu, and, guides, r, di, kibsi, both, probably, being, drawn, from, foreigners, resettled, in, assyra, the, majority, of, the, population, of, ancient, assyria, were, farmers, who, worked, land, owned, by, their, families, old, assyrian, society, was, divided, into, two, main, groups, slaves, subrum, and, free, citizens, referred, to, as, aw, lum, men, or, dumu, a, ur, sons, of, ashur, among, the, free, citizens, there, was, also, a, division, into, rabi, big, and, aher, small, members, of, the, city, assembly, assyrian, society, grew, more, complex, and, hierarchical, over, time, in, the, middle, assyrian, empire, there, were, several, groups, among, the, lower, classes, the, highest, of, which, were, the, free, men, a, l, who, like, the, upper, classes, could, receive, land, in, exchange, for, performing, duties, for, the, government, but, who, could, not, live, on, these, lands, since, they, were, comparably, small, below, the, free, men, were, the, unfree, men, iluhlu, the, unfree, men, had, given, up, their, freedom, and, entered, the, services, of, others, on, their, own, accord, and, were, in, turn, provided, with, clothes, and, rations, many, of, them, probably, originated, as, foreigners, though, similar, to, slavery, it, was, possible, for, an, unfree, person, to, regain, their, freedom, by, providing, a, replacement, and, they, were, during, their, service, considered, the, property, of, the, government, rather, than, their, employers, other, lower, classes, of, the, middle, assyrian, period, included, the, l, y, village, residents, lik, ilke, people, recruited, through, the, ilku, system, and, the, hup, u, though, what, these, designations, meant, in, terms, of, social, standing, and, living, standards, is, not, known, the, middle, assyrian, structure, of, society, by, and, large, endured, through, the, subsequent, neo, assyrian, period, below, the, higher, classes, of, neo, assyrian, society, were, free, citizens, semi, free, laborers, and, slaves, it, was, possible, through, steady, service, to, the, assyrian, state, bureaucracy, for, a, family, to, move, up, the, social, ladder, in, some, cases, stellar, work, conducted, by, a, single, individual, enhanced, the, status, of, their, family, for, generations, to, come, in, many, cases, assyrian, family, groups, or, clans, formed, large, population, groups, within, the, empire, referred, to, as, tribes, such, tribes, lived, together, in, villages, and, other, settlements, near, or, adjacent, to, their, agricultural, lands, slavery, was, an, intrinsic, part, of, nearly, every, society, in, the, ancient, near, east, there, were, two, main, types, of, slaves, in, ancient, assyria, chattel, slaves, primarily, foreigners, who, were, kidnapped, or, who, were, spoils, of, war, and, debt, slaves, formerly, free, men, and, women, who, had, been, unable, to, pay, off, their, debts, in, some, cases, assyrian, children, were, seized, by, authorities, due, to, the, debts, of, their, parents, and, sold, off, into, slavery, when, their, parents, were, unable, to, pay, children, born, to, slave, women, automatically, became, slaves, themselves, unless, some, other, arrangement, had, been, agreed, to, though, old, babylonian, texts, frequently, mention, the, geographical, and, ethnic, origin, of, slaves, there, is, only, a, single, known, such, reference, in, old, assyrian, texts, whereas, there, are, many, describing, slaves, in, a, general, sense, a, slave, girl, explicitly, being, referred, to, as, subaraean, indicating, that, ethnicity, was, not, seen, as, very, important, in, terms, of, slavery, the, surviving, evidence, suggests, that, the, number, of, slaves, in, assyria, never, reached, a, large, share, of, the, population, in, the, akkadian, language, several, terms, were, used, for, slaves, commonly, wardum, though, this, term, could, confusingly, also, be, used, for, free, official, servants, retainers, and, followers, soldiers, and, subjects, of, the, king, because, many, individuals, designated, as, wardum, in, assyrian, texts, are, described, as, handling, property, and, carrying, out, administrative, tasks, on, behalf, of, their, masters, many, may, have, in, actuality, been, free, servants, and, not, slaves, in, the, common, meaning, of, the, term, a, number, of, wardum, are, however, also, recorded, as, being, bought, and, sold, the, main, evidence, concerning, the, lives, of, ordinary, women, in, ancient, assyria, is, in, administrative, documents, and, law, codes, there, was, no, legal, distinction, between, men, and, women, in, the, old, assyrian, period, and, they, had, more, or, less, the, same, rights, in, society, since, several, letters, written, by, women, are, known, from, the, old, assyrian, period, it, is, evident, that, women, were, free, to, learn, how, to, read, and, write, both, men, and, women, paid, the, same, fines, could, inherit, property, participated, in, trade, bought, owned, and, sold, houses, and, slaves, made, their, own, last, wills, and, were, allowed, to, divorce, their, partners, records, of, old, assyrian, marriages, confirm, that, the, dowry, to, the, bride, belonged, to, her, not, the, husband, and, it, was, inherited, by, her, children, after, her, death, although, they, were, equal, legally, men, and, women, in, the, old, assyrian, period, were, raised, and, socialized, differently, and, had, different, social, expectations, and, obligations, typically, girls, were, raised, by, their, mothers, taught, to, spin, weave, and, help, with, daily, tasks, and, boys, were, taught, trades, by, masters, later, often, following, their, fathers, on, trade, expeditions, sometimes, the, eldest, daughter, of, a, family, was, consecrated, as, a, priestess, she, was, not, allowed, to, marry, and, became, economically, independent, wives, were, expected, to, provide, their, husbands, with, garments, and, food, although, marriages, were, typically, monogamous, husbands, were, allowed, to, buy, a, female, slave, in, order, to, produce, an, heir, if, his, wife, was, infertile, the, wife, was, allowed, to, choose, that, slave, and, the, slave, never, gained, the, status, of, a, second, wife, husbands, who, were, away, on, long, trading, journeys, were, allowed, to, take, a, second, wife, in, one, of, the, trading, colonies, although, with, strict, rules, that, must, be, followed, the, second, wife, was, not, allowed, to, accompany, him, back, to, assur, and, both, wives, had, to, be, provided, with, a, home, to, live, in, food, and, wood, the, status, of, women, decreased, in, the, middle, assyrian, period, as, can, be, gathered, from, laws, concerning, them, among, the, middle, assyrian, laws, among, these, laws, were, punishments, for, various, crimes, often, sexual, or, marital, ones, although, they, did, not, deprive, women, of, all, their, rights, and, they, were, not, significantly, different, from, other, ancient, near, eastern, laws, of, their, time, the, middle, assyrian, laws, effectively, made, women, second, class, citizens, however, it, is, not, clear, how, strongly, these, laws, were, enforced, these, laws, gave, men, the, right, to, punish, their, wives, as, they, wished, among, the, harshest, punishments, written, into, these, laws, for, a, crime, not, even, committed, by, the, woman, was, that, a, raped, woman, would, be, forcibly, married, to, her, rapist, these, laws, also, specified, that, certain, women, were, obliged, to, wear, veils, while, out, on, the, street, marital, status, being, the, determining, factor, some, women, such, as, slave, women, and, ar, mt, women, were, prohibited, from, wearing, veils, and, others, such, as, certain, priestesses, were, only, allowed, to, wear, veils, if, they, were, married, not, all, laws, were, suppressive, against, women, women, whose, husbands, died, or, were, taken, prisoner, in, war, and, who, did, not, have, any, sons, or, relatives, to, support, them, were, guaranteed, support, from, the, government, the, ar, mt, women, have, historically, been, believed, to, have, been, prostitutes, but, today, are, interpreted, as, women, with, an, independent, social, existence, i, e, not, tied, to, a, husband, father, or, institution, although, most, ar, mt, appear, to, have, been, poor, there, were, noteworthy, exceptions, the, term, appears, with, negative, connotations, in, several, texts, their, mere, existence, makes, it, clear, that, it, was, possible, for, women, to, live, independent, lives, despite, their, lesser, social, standing, during, that, period, during, the, neo, assyrian, period, that, followed, royal, and, upper, class, women, experienced, increased, influence, women, attached, to, the, neo, assyrian, royal, court, sent, and, received, letters, were, independently, wealthy, and, could, buy, and, own, lands, of, their, own, the, queens, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, are, better, attested, historically, than, queens, of, preceding, periods, of, the, culture, under, the, sargonid, dynasty, they, were, granted, their, own, military, units, sometimes, they, are, known, to, have, partaken, alongside, other, units, in, military, campaigns, among, the, most, influential, women, of, the, neo, assyrian, period, were, shammuramat, queen, of, shamshi, adad, v, r, 824, 811, bc, who, in, the, reign, of, her, son, adad, nirari, iii, r, 811, 783, bc, might, have, been, regent, and, participated, in, military, campaigns, another, is, naqi, a, who, influenced, politics, in, the, reigns, of, sennacherib, esarhaddon, and, ashurbanipal, in, the, old, assyrian, period, a, major, portion, of, assur, s, population, was, involved, in, the, city, s, international, trade, as, can, be, gathered, from, hiring, contracts, and, other, records, the, trade, involved, people, of, many, different, occupations, including, porters, guides, donkey, drivers, agents, traders, bakers, and, bankers, because, of, the, extensive, cuneiform, records, known, from, the, period, details, of, the, trade, are, relatively, well, known, it, has, been, estimated, that, just, in, the, period, c, 1950, 1836, bc, twenty, five, tons, of, anatolian, silver, was, transported, to, assur, and, that, approximately, one, hundred, tons, of, tin, and, 100, 000, textiles, were, transported, to, anatolia, in, return, the, assyrians, also, sold, livestock, processed, goods, and, reed, products, in, many, cases, the, materials, sold, by, assyrian, colonists, came, from, far, away, places, the, textiles, sold, by, assyrians, in, anatolia, were, imported, from, southern, mesopotamia, and, the, tin, came, from, the, east, in, the, zagros, mountains, after, international, trade, declined, in, the, 19th, century, bc, the, assyrian, economy, became, increasingly, oriented, toward, the, state, in, the, neo, assyrian, period, the, wealth, generated, through, private, investments, was, dwarfed, by, the, wealth, of, the, state, which, was, by, far, the, largest, employer, in, the, empire, and, had, a, monopoly, on, agriculture, manufacturing, and, exploitation, of, minerals, the, imperial, economy, advantaged, mainly, the, elite, since, it, was, structured, in, a, way, that, ensured, that, surplus, wealth, flowed, to, the, government, and, was, then, used, for, the, maintenance, of, the, state, throughout, the, empire, though, all, means, of, production, were, owned, by, the, state, there, also, continued, to, be, a, vibrant, private, economic, sector, within, the, empire, with, property, rights, of, individuals, ensured, by, the, government, ethnicity, and, culture, are, largely, based, in, self, perception, and, self, designation, a, distinct, assyrian, identity, seems, to, have, formed, already, in, the, old, assyrian, period, when, distinctly, assyrian, burial, practices, foods, and, dress, codes, are, attested, and, assyrian, documents, appear, to, consider, the, inhabitants, of, assur, to, be, a, distinct, cultural, group, a, wider, assyrian, identity, appears, to, have, spread, across, northern, mesopotamia, under, the, middle, assyrian, empire, since, later, writings, concerning, the, reconquests, of, the, early, neo, assyrian, kings, refer, to, some, of, their, wars, as, liberating, the, assyrian, people, of, the, cities, they, reconquered, surviving, evidence, suggests, that, the, ancient, assyrians, had, a, relatively, open, definition, of, what, it, meant, to, be, assyrian, modern, ideas, such, as, a, person, s, ethnic, background, or, the, roman, idea, of, legal, citizenship, do, not, appear, to, have, been, reflected, in, ancient, assyria, although, assyrian, accounts, and, artwork, of, warfare, frequently, describe, and, depict, foreign, enemies, they, are, not, depicted, with, different, physical, features, but, rather, with, different, clothing, and, equipment, assyrian, accounts, describe, enemies, as, barbaric, only, in, terms, of, their, behavior, as, lacking, correct, religious, practices, and, as, doing, wrongdoings, against, assyria, all, things, considered, there, does, not, appear, to, have, been, any, well, developed, concepts, of, ethnicity, or, race, in, ancient, assyria, what, mattered, for, a, person, to, be, seen, by, others, as, assyrian, was, mainly, fulfillment, of, obligations, such, as, military, service, being, affiliated, with, the, assyrian, empire, politically, and, maintaining, loyalty, to, the, assyrian, king, one, of, the, inscriptions, that, attest, to, this, view, as, well, as, royal, assyrian, policies, enacted, to, encourage, assimilation, and, cultural, mixture, is, sargon, ii, s, account, of, the, construction, of, dur, sharrukin, one, of, the, passages, of, the, inscription, reads, subjects, of, all, four, parts, of, the, world, of, foreign, tongues, with, different, languages, without, similarity, people, from, mountainous, regions, and, plains, so, many, different, people, as, the, light, of, the, gods, lord, above, all, supervises, i, let, dwell, inside, on, the, command, of, ashur, my, lord, born, assyrians, experienced, in, all, professions, i, set, above, them, as, supervisors, and, guides, to, teach, them, how, to, work, properly, and, respect, the, gods, and, the, king, although, the, text, clearly, differentiates, the, new, settlers, from, those, that, had, been, born, assyrians, the, aim, of, sargon, s, policy, was, also, clearly, to, transform, the, new, settlers, into, assyrians, through, appointing, supervisors, and, guides, to, teach, them, though, the, expansion, of, the, assyrian, empire, in, combination, with, resettlements, and, deportations, changed, the, ethno, cultural, make, up, of, the, assyrian, heartland, there, is, no, evidence, to, suggest, that, the, more, ancient, assyrian, inhabitants, of, the, land, ever, disappeared, or, became, restricted, to, a, small, elite, nor, that, the, ethnic, and, cultural, identity, of, the, new, settlers, was, anything, other, than, assyrian, after, one, or, two, generations, although, the, use, of, the, term, assyrian, by, the, modern, assyrian, people, has, historically, been, the, target, of, misunderstanding, and, controversy, both, politically, and, academically, assyrian, continuity, is, generally, scholarly, accepted, based, on, both, historical, and, genetic, evidence, in, the, sense, that, the, modern, assyrians, are, regarded, to, be, descendants, of, the, population, of, the, ancient, assyrian, empire, though, the, ancient, akkadian, language, and, cuneiform, script, did, not, survive, for, long, in, assyria, after, the, empire, was, destroyed, in, 609, bc, assyrian, culture, clearly, did, the, old, assyrian, religion, continued, to, be, practised, at, assur, until, the, 3rd, century, ad, and, at, other, sites, for, centuries, thereafter, gradually, losing, ground, to, christianity, at, mardin, believers, in, the, old, religion, are, known, from, as, late, as, the, 18th, century, individuals, with, names, harkening, back, to, ancient, mesopotamia, are, also, attested, at, assur, until, it, was, sacked, for, the, last, time, in, ad, 240, and, at, other, sites, as, late, as, the, 13th, century, though, many, foreign, states, ruled, over, assyria, in, the, millennia, following, the, empire, s, fall, there, is, no, evidence, of, any, large, scale, influx, of, immigrants, that, replaced, the, original, population, which, instead, continued, to, make, up, a, significant, portion, of, the, region, s, people, until, the, mongol, and, timurid, massacres, in, the, late, 14th, century, in, pre, modern, syriac, language, the, type, of, aramaic, used, in, christian, mesopotamian, writings, sources, the, typical, self, designations, used, are, r, m, y, aramean, and, sury, y, with, the, term, thor, y, assyrian, rarely, being, used, as, a, self, designation, the, terms, assyria, thor, and, assyrian, thor, y, were, however, used, in, several, senses, in, pre, modern, times, most, notably, being, used, for, the, ancient, assyrians, and, for, the, land, surrounding, nineveh, and, for, the, city, of, mosul, built, next, to, nineveh, s, ruins, in, syriac, translations, of, the, bible, the, term, thor, is, also, used, to, refer, to, the, ancient, assyrian, empire, in, the, sense, of, a, citizen, of, mosul, the, designation, thor, y, were, used, for, some, individuals, in, the, pre, modern, period, the, reluctance, of, christians, to, use, thor, y, as, a, self, designation, could, perhaps, be, explained, by, the, assyrians, described, in, the, bible, being, prominent, enemies, of, israel, the, term, thor, y, was, sometimes, employed, in, syriac, writings, as, a, term, for, enemies, of, christians, in, this, context, the, term, was, sometimes, applied, to, the, persians, of, the, sasanian, empire, the, 4th, century, syriac, writer, ephrem, the, syrian, for, instance, referred, to, the, sasanian, empire, as, filthy, thor, mother, of, corruption, in, a, similar, fashion, the, term, was, also, sometimes, applied, to, the, later, muslim, rulers, the, self, designation, sury, y, sury, y, or, s, r, y, sometimes, translated, as, syrian, is, believed, to, be, derived, from, the, akkadian, term, ass, r, yu, assyrian, which, was, sometimes, even, in, ancient, times, rendered, in, the, shorter, form, s, r, yu, some, medieval, syriac, christian, documents, used, s, r, y, and, s, r, y, rather, than, th, r, y, also, for, the, ancient, assyrians, medieval, and, modern, armenian, sources, also, connected, ass, r, yu, and, sury, y, consistently, referring, to, the, aramaic, speaking, christians, of, mesopotamia, and, syria, as, asori, despite, the, complex, issue, of, self, designations, pre, modern, syriac, language, sources, at, times, identified, positively, with, the, ancient, assyrians, and, drew, connections, between, the, ancient, empire, and, themselves, most, prominently, ancient, assyrian, kings, and, figures, long, appeared, in, local, folklore, and, literary, tradition, and, claims, of, descent, from, ancient, assyrian, royalty, were, forwarded, both, for, figures, in, folklore, and, by, actual, living, high, ranking, members, of, society, in, northern, mesopotamia, visits, by, missionaries, from, various, western, churches, to, the, assyrian, heartland, in, the, 18th, century, likely, contributed, to, the, assyrian, people, more, strongly, relating, their, self, designation, and, identity, to, ancient, assyria, in, the, context, of, interactions, with, westerners, who, connected, them, to, the, ancient, assyrians, and, due, to, an, increasing, number, of, atrocities, and, massacres, directed, against, them, the, assyrian, people, experienced, a, cultural, awakening, or, renaissance, toward, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, which, led, to, the, development, of, a, national, ideology, more, strongly, rooted, in, their, descent, from, ancient, assyria, and, a, re, adoption, of, self, designations, such, as, thor, y, and, sur, y, today, s, ry, y, or, s, r, y, are, the, predominant, self, designations, used, by, assyrians, in, their, native, language, though, they, are, typically, translated, as, assyrian, rather, than, syrian, the, ancient, assyrians, primarily, spoke, and, wrote, the, assyrian, language, a, semitic, language, i, e, related, to, modern, hebrew, and, arabic, closely, related, to, babylonian, spoken, in, southern, mesopotamia, both, assyrian, and, babylonian, are, generally, regarded, by, modern, scholars, to, be, dialects, of, the, akkadian, language, this, is, a, modern, convention, since, contemporary, ancient, authors, considered, assyrian, and, babylonian, to, be, two, separate, languages, only, babylonian, was, referred, to, as, akkad, m, with, assyrian, being, referred, to, as, a, ur, or, a, ur, yu, though, both, were, written, with, cuneiform, script, the, signs, look, quite, different, and, can, be, distinguished, relatively, easily, given, the, vast, timespan, covered, by, ancient, assyria, the, assyrian, language, developed, and, evolved, over, time, modern, scholars, broadly, categorize, it, into, three, different, periods, roughly, though, far, from, precisely, corresponding, to, the, periods, used, to, divide, assyrian, history, the, old, assyrian, language, 2000, 1500, bc, middle, assyrian, language, 1500, 1000, bc, and, neo, assyrian, language, 1000, 500, bc, because, the, record, of, assyrian, tablets, and, documents, is, still, somewhat, spotty, many, of, the, stages, of, the, language, remain, poorly, known, and, documented, the, signs, used, in, old, assyrian, texts, are, for, the, most, part, less, complex, than, those, used, during, the, succeeding, middle, and, neo, assyrian, periods, and, they, were, fewer, in, number, amounting, to, no, more, than, 150, 200, unique, signs, most, of, which, were, syllabic, signs, representing, syllables, due, to, the, limited, number, of, signs, used, old, assyrian, is, relatively, easier, to, decipher, for, modern, researchers, than, later, forms, of, the, language, though, the, limited, number, of, signs, also, means, that, there, are, in, cases, several, possible, alternative, phonetic, values, and, readings, this, means, that, while, it, is, easy, to, decipher, the, signs, many, researchers, remain, uncomfortable, with, the, language, itself, though, it, was, a, more, archaic, variant, of, the, later, assyrian, language, old, assyrian, also, contains, several, words, that, are, not, attested, in, later, periods, some, being, peculiar, early, forms, of, words, and, others, being, names, for, commercial, terms, or, various, textile, and, food, products, from, anatolia, in, the, middle, and, neo, assyrian, empires, the, later, versions, of, the, assyrian, language, were, not, the, only, versions, of, akkadian, used, though, assyrian, was, typically, used, in, letters, legal, documents, administrative, documents, and, as, a, vernacular, standard, babylonian, was, also, used, in, an, official, capacity, standard, babylonian, was, a, highly, codified, version, of, ancient, babylonian, as, used, around, 1500, bc, and, was, used, as, a, language, of, high, culture, for, nearly, all, scholarly, documents, literature, poetry, and, royal, inscriptions, the, culture, of, the, assyrian, elite, was, strongly, influenced, by, babylonia, in, the, south, in, a, vein, similar, to, how, greek, civilization, was, respected, in, and, influenced, ancient, rome, the, assyrians, had, much, respect, for, babylon, and, its, ancient, culture, because, of, the, multilingual, nature, of, the, vast, empire, many, loan, words, are, attested, as, entering, the, assyrian, language, during, the, neo, assyrian, period, the, number, of, surviving, documents, written, in, cuneiform, grow, considerably, fewer, in, the, late, reign, of, ashurbanipal, which, suggests, that, the, language, was, declining, since, it, is, probably, attributable, to, an, increased, use, of, aramaic, often, written, on, perishable, materials, such, as, leather, scrolls, or, papyrus, the, ancient, assyrian, language, did, not, disappear, completely, until, around, the, end, of, the, 6th, century, bc, well, into, the, subsequent, post, imperial, period, because, the, assyrians, never, imposed, their, language, on, foreign, peoples, whose, lands, they, conquered, outside, of, the, assyrian, heartland, there, were, no, mechanisms, in, place, to, stop, the, spread, of, languages, other, than, akkadian, beginning, with, the, migrations, of, arameans, into, assyrian, territory, during, the, middle, assyrian, period, this, lack, of, linguistic, policies, facilitated, the, spread, of, the, aramaic, language, as, the, most, widely, spoken, and, mutually, understandable, of, the, semitic, languages, the, language, group, containing, many, of, the, languages, spoken, through, the, empire, aramaic, grew, in, importance, throughout, the, neo, assyrian, period, and, increasingly, replaced, the, neo, assyrian, language, even, within, the, assyrian, heartland, itself, from, the, 9th, century, bc, onward, aramaic, became, the, de, facto, lingua, franca, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, with, neo, assyrian, and, other, forms, of, akkadian, becoming, relegated, to, a, language, of, the, political, elite, from, the, time, of, shalmaneser, iii, in, the, 9th, century, bc, aramaic, was, used, in, state, related, contexts, alongside, akkadian, and, by, the, time, of, tiglath, pileser, iii, the, kings, employed, both, akkadian, and, aramaic, language, royal, scribes, confirming, the, rise, of, aramaic, to, a, position, of, an, official, language, used, by, the, imperial, administration, during, the, time, after, the, fall, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, the, old, assyrian, language, was, completely, abandoned, in, mesopotamia, in, favor, of, aramaic, by, 500, bc, akkadian, was, probably, no, longer, a, spoken, language, modern, assyrian, people, refer, to, their, language, as, assyrian, s, rayt, or, s, reth, though, it, has, little, in, common, with, the, assyrian, dialect, of, the, akkadian, language, it, is, a, modern, version, of, the, ancient, mesopotamian, aramaic, the, language, retains, some, influence, of, ancient, akkadian, particularly, in, the, form, of, loanwords, modern, assyrian, varieties, of, aramaic, are, often, referred, to, by, scholars, as, neo, aramaic, or, neo, syriac, as, a, liturgical, language, many, assyrians, also, speak, syriac, a, codified, version, of, classical, aramaic, as, spoken, at, edessa, during, the, christianization, of, assyria, another, language, sometimes, used, in, ancient, assyria, as, a, language, of, scholarship, and, culture, though, only, in, written, form, was, the, ancient, sumerian, language, at, the, height, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, various, other, local, languages, were, also, spoken, within, the, imperial, borders, though, none, achieved, the, same, level, of, official, recognition, as, aramaic, there, are, three, surviving, forms, of, primary, evidence, for, the, architecture, of, ancient, assyria, the, most, important, form, is, the, surviving, buildings, themselves, found, through, archaeological, excavations, but, important, evidence, can, also, be, gathered, from, both, contemporary, documentation, such, as, letters, and, administrative, documents, that, describe, buildings, that, might, not, have, been, preserved, as, well, as, documentation, by, later, kings, concerning, the, building, works, of, previous, kings, assyrian, buildings, and, construction, works, were, almost, always, constructed, out, of, mudbrick, limestone, was, also, used, though, primarily, only, in, works, such, as, aqueducts, and, river, walls, exposed, to, running, water, and, defensive, fortifications, in, order, to, support, large, buildings, they, were, often, built, on, top, of, foundation, platforms, or, on, mud, brick, foundations, floors, were, typically, made, of, rammed, earth, covered, in, important, rooms, with, carpets, or, reed, mats, floors, in, locations, that, were, exposed, to, the, elements, such, as, outside, on, terraces, or, in, courtyards, were, paved, with, stone, slabs, or, backed, bricks, roofs, particularly, in, larger, rooms, were, supported, through, the, use, of, wooden, beams, the, ancient, assyrians, accomplished, several, technologically, complex, construction, projects, including, constructions, of, whole, new, capital, cities, which, indicates, sophisticated, technical, knowledge, though, in, large, part, following, previous, mesopotamian, architecture, there, are, several, characteristic, features, of, ancient, assyrian, architecture, some, examples, of, features, of, ancient, assyrian, architecture, include, stepped, merlons, vaulted, roofs, and, palaces, to, a, large, degree, often, being, made, up, of, sets, of, self, contained, suites, a, relatively, large, number, of, statues, and, figurines, have, been, recovered, from, the, ruins, of, temples, in, assur, dating, to, the, early, assyrian, period, most, of, the, surviving, artwork, from, this, time, was, clearly, influenced, by, the, artwork, of, foreign, powers, for, instance, a, set, of, 87, alabaster, figures, of, male, and, female, worshippers, from, assur, before, the, rise, of, the, akkadian, empire, greatly, resembles, early, dynastic, sumerian, figures, because, of, variation, in, artwork, elsewhere, the, artwork, of, early, assur, was, also, highly, variable, depending, on, the, time, period, ranging, from, highly, stylized, to, highly, naturalistic, among, the, most, unique, finds, from, the, early, period, is, the, head, of, a, woman, of, which, her, eyes, eyebrows, and, elaborate, hair, covering, were, originally, inlaid, this, head, is, typical, of, the, art, style, of, the, akkadian, period, with, an, overall, naturalistic, style, smooth, and, soft, curves, and, a, full, mouth, another, unique, art, piece, from, the, early, period, is, an, ivory, figurine, of, a, nude, woman, and, fragments, of, at, least, five, additional, similar, figurines, the, ivory, used, might, have, come, from, indian, elephants, which, would, indicate, trade, between, early, assur, and, the, early, tribes, and, states, of, iran, among, other, artwork, known, from, the, early, period, are, a, handful, of, large, stone, statues, of, rulers, governors, and, foreign, kings, figures, of, animals, and, stone, statues, of, naked, women, the, artwork, known, from, the, old, assyrian, period, other, than, a, few, objects, such, as, a, partial, stone, statue, perhaps, depicting, erishum, i, is, largely, limited, to, seals, and, impressions, of, seals, on, cuneiform, documents, royal, seals, from, the, puzur, ashur, dynasty, of, kings, prior, to, the, rise, of, shamshi, adad, i, are, very, similar, to, the, seals, of, the, kings, of, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, in, the, middle, assyrian, period, from, ashur, uballit, i, onward, seals, looked, quite, different, and, appear, to, emphasize, royal, power, rather, than, the, theological, and, cosmic, sources, of, the, king, s, right, to, rule, among, non, royal, seals, of, the, middle, assyrian, period, a, wide, assortment, of, different, motifs, are, known, including, both, religious, scenes, and, peaceful, scenes, of, animals, and, trees, from, the, time, of, tukulti, ninurta, i, onward, seals, also, sometimes, featured, contests, and, struggles, between, humans, various, animals, and, mythological, creatures, several, other, new, artistic, innovations, were, also, made, in, the, middle, assyrian, period, in, the, temple, dedicated, to, ishtar, in, assur, four, cult, pedestals, or, altars, from, the, time, of, tukulti, ninurta, i, have, been, discovered, these, altars, were, decorated, with, various, motifs, common, inclusions, being, the, king, sometimes, multiple, times, and, protective, divine, figures, and, standards, one, of, the, pedestals, preserves, along, the, lower, step, of, its, base, a, relief, image, which, is, the, earliest, known, narrative, image, in, assyrian, art, history, this, relief, which, is, not, very, well, preserved, appears, to, depict, rows, of, prisoners, before, the, assyrian, king, the, earliest, known, assyrian, wall, paintings, are, also, from, the, time, of, tukulti, ninurta, i, from, his, palace, in, kar, tukulti, ninurta, motifs, included, plant, based, patterns, rosettes, and, palmettes, trees, and, bird, headed, genies, the, colors, used, to, paint, the, walls, included, black, red, blue, and, white, an, unusual, limestone, statue, of, a, nude, woman, is, known, from, nineveh, from, the, time, of, ashur, bel, kala, r, 1074, 1056, bc, an, entirely, new, type, of, monument, introduced, in, the, 11th, century, bc, were, obelisks, four, sided, stone, stelae, decorated, all, around, with, both, images, and, text, obelisks, saw, continued, use, until, at, least, the, 9th, century, bc, compared, to, other, periods, a, larger, amount, of, artwork, survives, from, the, neo, assyrian, period, particularly, monumental, art, made, under, the, patronage, of, the, kings, the, most, well, known, form, of, neo, assyrian, monumental, art, are, wall, reliefs, carved, stone, artwork, that, lined, the, internal, and, external, walls, of, temples, and, palaces, another, well, known, form, of, neo, assyrian, art, are, colossi, often, human, headed, lions, or, bulls, lamassu, that, were, placed, at, the, gates, of, temples, palaces, and, cities, the, earliest, known, examples, of, both, wall, reliefs, and, colossi, are, from, the, reign, of, ashurnasirpal, ii, who, might, have, been, inspired, by, the, hittite, monumental, art, that, he, saw, on, his, campaigns, to, the, mediterranean, wall, paintings, such, as, those, made, under, tukulti, ninurta, i, in, the, middle, assyrian, period, also, continued, to, be, used, sometimes, to, supplement, wall, reliefs, and, sometimes, instead, of, them, interior, walls, could, be, decorated, by, covering, the, mudbrick, used, in, construction, with, painted, mud, plaster, and, exterior, walls, were, at, times, decorated, with, glazed, and, painted, tiles, or, bricks, the, most, extensive, known, surviving, sets, of, wall, reliefs, are, from, the, reign, of, sennacherib, in, terms, of, neo, assyrian, artwork, modern, scholars, have, paid, particular, attention, to, the, reliefs, produced, under, ashurbanipal, which, have, been, described, as, possessing, a, distinct, epic, quality, unlike, the, art, under, his, predecessors, ancient, assyrian, literature, drew, heavily, on, babylonian, literary, traditions, both, the, old, and, middle, assyrian, periods, are, limited, in, terms, of, surviving, literary, texts, the, most, important, surviving, old, assyrian, literary, work, is, sargon, lord, of, lies, a, text, found, in, a, well, preserved, version, on, a, cuneiform, tablet, from, k, ltepe, once, thought, to, have, been, a, parody, the, tale, is, a, first, person, narrative, of, the, reign, of, sargon, of, akkad, the, founder, of, the, akkadian, empire, the, text, follows, sargon, as, he, gains, strength, from, the, god, adad, swears, by, ishtar, the, lady, of, combat, and, speaks, with, the, gods, surviving, middle, assyrian, literature, is, only, slightly, more, diverse, a, distinct, assyrian, scholarship, tradition, though, still, drawing, on, babylonian, tradition, is, conventionally, placed, as, beginning, around, the, time, of, the, beginning, of, the, middle, assyrian, period, the, rising, status, of, scholarship, at, this, time, might, be, connected, to, the, kings, beginning, to, regard, amassing, knowledge, as, a, way, to, strengthen, their, power, known, middle, assyrian, works, include, the, tukulti, ninurta, epic, a, narrative, of, the, reign, of, tukulti, ninurta, i, and, his, exploits, fragments, of, other, royal, epics, the, hunter, a, short, martial, poem, and, some, royal, hymns, the, clear, majority, of, surviving, ancient, assyrian, literature, is, from, the, neo, assyrian, period, the, kings, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, began, to, see, preserving, knowledge, as, one, of, their, responsibilities, and, not, as, previous, kings, had, a, responsibility, of, private, individuals, and, temples, this, development, might, have, originated, with, the, kings, no, longer, viewing, the, divination, performed, by, their, diviners, as, enough, and, wished, to, have, access, to, the, relevant, texts, themselves, the, office, of, chief, scholar, is, first, attested, in, the, reign, of, the, neo, assyrian, king, tukulti, ninurta, ii, most, of, the, surviving, ancient, assyrian, literature, comes, from, the, neo, assyrian, library, of, ashurbanipal, which, included, more, than, 30, 000, documents, libraries, were, built, in, the, neo, assyrian, period, to, preserve, knowledge, of, the, past, and, maintain, scribal, culture, neo, assyrian, texts, fall, into, a, wide, array, of, genres, including, divinatory, texts, divination, reports, treatments, for, the, sick, either, medical, or, magical, ritual, texts, incantations, prayers, and, hymns, school, texts, and, literary, texts, an, innovation, of, the, neo, assyrian, period, were, the, annals, a, genre, of, texts, recording, the, events, of, the, reigns, of, a, king, particularly, military, exploits, annals, were, disseminated, throughout, the, empire, and, probably, served, propagandistic, purposes, supporting, the, legitimacy, of, the, king, s, rule, various, purely, literary, works, previously, aligned, by, scholars, with, propaganda, are, known, from, the, neo, assyrian, period, such, works, include, among, others, the, underworld, vision, of, an, assyrian, crown, prince, the, sin, of, sargon, and, the, marduk, ordeal, in, addition, to, their, own, works, the, assyrians, copied, and, preserved, earlier, mesopotamian, literature, the, inclusion, of, texts, such, as, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, the, en, ma, eli, the, babylonian, creation, myth, erra, the, myth, of, etana, and, the, epic, of, anzu, in, the, library, of, ashurbanipal, is, the, primary, reason, for, how, such, texts, have, survived, to, the, present, day, knowledge, of, the, ancient, polytheistic, assyrian, religion, referred, to, as, ashurism, by, some, modern, assyrians, is, mostly, limited, to, state, cults, given, that, little, can, be, ascertained, of, the, personal, religious, beliefs, and, practices, of, the, common, people, of, ancient, assyria, the, assyrians, worshipped, the, same, pantheon, of, gods, as, the, babylonians, in, southern, mesopotamia, the, chief, assyrian, deity, was, the, national, deity, ashur, though, the, deity, and, the, ancient, capital, city, are, commonly, distinguished, by, modern, historians, through, calling, the, god, ashur, and, the, city, assur, both, were, inscribed, in, the, exact, same, way, in, ancient, times, a, ur, in, documents, from, the, preceding, old, assyrian, period, the, city, and, god, are, often, not, clearly, differentiated, which, suggests, that, ashur, originated, sometime, in, the, early, assyrian, period, as, a, deified, personification, of, the, city, itself, below, ashur, the, other, mesopotamian, deities, were, organized, in, a, hierarchy, with, each, having, their, own, assigned, roles, the, sun, god, shamash, was, for, instance, regarded, as, a, god, of, justice, and, ishtar, was, seen, as, a, goddess, of, love, and, war, and, their, own, primary, seats, of, worship, ninurta, was, for, instance, primarily, worshipped, at, nimrud, and, ishtar, primarily, at, arbela, quintessentially, babylonian, deities, such, as, enlil, marduk, and, nabu, were, worshipped, in, assyria, just, as, much, as, in, babylonia, and, several, traditionally, babylonian, rituals, such, as, the, akitu, festival, were, borrowed, in, the, north, ashur, s, role, as, the, chief, deity, was, flexible, and, changed, with, the, changing, culture, and, politics, of, the, assyrians, themselves, in, the, old, assyrian, period, ashur, was, mainly, regarded, as, a, god, of, death, and, revival, related, to, agriculture, under, the, middle, and, neo, assyrian, empire, ashur, s, role, was, expanded, and, thoroughly, altered, possibly, originating, as, a, reaction, to, the, period, of, suzerainty, under, the, mittani, kingdom, middle, assyrian, theology, presented, ashur, as, a, god, of, war, who, bestowed, the, assyrian, kings, not, only, with, divine, legitimacy, something, retained, from, the, old, assyrian, period, but, also, commanded, the, kings, to, enlarge, assyria, the, land, of, ashur, with, ashur, s, just, scepter, i, e, expand, the, assyrian, empire, through, military, conquest, this, militarization, of, ashur, might, also, have, derived, from, the, amorite, conqueror, shamshi, adad, i, equating, ashur, with, the, southern, enlil, during, his, rule, over, northern, mesopotamia, in, the, 18th, and, 17th, centuries, bc, in, the, middle, assyrian, period, ashur, is, attested, with, the, title, king, of, the, gods, a, role, previous, civilizations, in, both, northern, and, southern, mesopotamia, ascribed, to, enlil, the, development, of, equating, ashur, with, enlil, or, at, least, transferring, enlil, s, role, to, ashur, was, paralleled, in, babylon, where, the, previously, unimportant, local, god, marduk, was, elevated, in, the, reign, of, hammurabi, 18th, century, bc, to, the, head, of, the, pantheon, modelled, after, enlil, assyrian, religion, was, centered, in, temples, monumental, structures, that, included, a, central, shrine, which, housed, the, cult, statue, of, the, temple, s, god, and, several, subordinate, chapels, with, space, for, statues, of, other, deities, temples, were, typically, self, contained, communities, they, had, their, own, economic, resources, chiefly, in, the, form, of, land, holdings, and, their, own, hierarchically, organized, personnel, in, later, times, temples, became, increasingly, dependent, on, royal, benefits, in, the, shape, of, specific, taxes, offerings, and, donations, of, booty, and, tribute, the, head, of, a, temple, was, titled, as, the, chief, administrator, and, was, responsible, to, the, assyrian, king, since, the, king, was, regarded, to, be, ashur, s, representative, in, the, mortal, world, records, from, temples, showcase, that, divination, in, the, form, of, astrology, and, extispicy, studying, the, entrails, of, dead, animals, were, important, parts, of, the, assyrian, religion, since, they, were, believed, to, be, means, through, which, deities, communicated, with, the, mortal, world, unlike, many, other, ancient, empires, the, neo, assyrian, empire, did, at, its, height, not, impose, its, culture, and, religion, on, conquered, regions, there, were, no, significant, temples, built, for, ashur, outside, of, northern, mesopotamia, in, the, post, imperial, period, after, the, fall, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, the, assyrians, continued, to, venerate, ashur, and, the, rest, of, the, pantheon, though, without, the, assyrian, state, religious, beliefs, in, many, parts, of, the, assyrian, heartland, diverged, and, developed, in, different, directions, from, the, time, of, seleucid, rule, over, the, region, 4th, to, 2nd, century, bc, onward, there, was, a, strong, influence, of, the, ancient, greek, religion, with, many, greek, deities, becoming, syncretized, with, mesopotamian, deities, there, was, also, some, influence, of, judaism, given, that, the, kings, of, adiabene, a, vassal, kingdom, covering, much, of, the, old, assyrian, heartland, converted, to, judaism, in, the, 1st, century, ad, in, the, 1st, century, bc, onward, as, a, frontier, region, between, the, roman, and, the, parthian, empires, assyria, was, likely, highly, religiously, complex, and, diverse, under, parthian, rule, both, old, and, new, gods, were, worshipped, at, assur, as, late, as, the, time, of, the, city, s, second, destruction, in, the, 3rd, century, ad, the, most, important, deity, was, still, ashur, known, during, this, time, as, assor, or, asor, worship, of, ashur, during, this, time, was, carried, out, in, the, same, way, as, it, had, been, in, ancient, times, per, a, cultic, calendar, effectively, identical, to, that, used, under, the, neo, assyrian, empire, 800, years, prior, the, ancient, mesopotamian, religion, persisted, in, some, places, for, centuries, after, the, end, of, the, post, imperial, period, such, as, at, harran, until, at, least, the, 10th, century, the, sabians, of, harran, and, at, mardin, until, as, late, as, the, 18th, century, the, shams, yah, the, church, of, the, east, developed, early, in, christian, history, though, tradition, holds, that, christianity, was, first, spread, to, mesopotamia, by, thomas, the, apostle, the, exact, timespan, when, the, assyrians, were, first, christianized, is, unknown, the, city, of, arbela, was, an, important, early, christian, center, according, to, the, later, chronicle, of, arbela, arbela, became, the, seat, of, a, bishop, already, in, ad, 100, but, the, reliability, of, this, document, is, questioned, among, scholars, it, is, however, known, that, both, arbela, and, kirkuk, later, served, as, important, christian, centers, in, the, sasanian, and, later, islamic, periods, according, to, some, traditions, christianity, took, hold, in, assyria, when, saint, thaddeus, of, edessa, converted, king, abgar, v, of, osroene, in, the, mid, 1st, century, ad, from, the, 3rd, century, ad, onward, it, is, clear, that, christianity, was, becoming, the, major, religion, of, the, region, with, christ, replacing, the, old, mesopotamian, deities, assyrians, had, by, this, time, already, intellectually, contributed, to, christian, thought, in, the, 1st, century, ad, the, christian, assyrian, writer, tatian, composed, the, influential, diatessaron, a, synoptic, rendition, of, the, gospels, though, christianity, is, today, an, intrinsic, part, of, assyrian, identity, assyrian, christians, have, over, the, centuries, splintered, into, a, number, of, different, christian, denominations, though, the, prominent, assyrian, church, of, the, east, the, followers, of, which, have, often, been, termed, nestorians, continues, to, exist, other, prominent, eastern, churches, include, the, chaldean, catholic, church, which, split, off, in, the, 16th, century, the, syriac, orthodox, church, the, syriac, catholic, church, and, the, ancient, church, of, the, east, which, branched, off, from, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, in, 1968, though, these, churches, have, been, distinct, for, centuries, they, still, follow, much, of, the, same, liturgical, spiritual, and, theological, foundation, there, are, also, assyrian, followers, of, various, denominations, of, protestantism, chiefly, due, to, missions, by, american, missionaries, of, the, presbyterian, church, because, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, remains, dismissed, as, nestorian, and, heretical, by, many, other, branches, of, christianity, it, has, not, been, admitted, into, the, middle, east, council, of, churches, and, it, does, not, take, part, in, the, joint, international, commission, for, theological, dialogue, between, the, catholic, church, and, the, orthodox, church, this, does, not, mean, that, efforts, to, approach, ecumenism, have, not, been, undertaken, in, 1994, pope, john, paul, ii, and, patriarch, dinkha, iv, signed, the, common, christological, declaration, between, the, catholic, church, and, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, with, some, further, efforts, also, having, been, made, in, the, years, since, historically, the, main, obstacle, in, the, way, of, ecumenism, has, been, the, ancient, text, liturgy, of, addai, and, mari, used, in, the, assyrian, churches, wherein, the, anaphora, does, not, contain, the, words, of, institution, seen, as, indispensable, by, the, catholic, church, this, obstacle, was, removed, in, 2001, when, the, catholic, congregation, for, the, doctrine, of, the, faith, determined, that, the, text, could, be, considered, valid, in, catholicism, as, well, despite, the, absence, of, the, words, some, efforts, have, also, been, made, to, approach, reunification, of, the, assyrian, and, chaldean, churches, in, 1996, dinkha, iv, and, patriarch, raphael, i, bidawid, of, the, chaldean, church, signed, a, list, of, common, proposals, to, move, toward, unity, approved, by, synods, of, both, churches, in, 1997
