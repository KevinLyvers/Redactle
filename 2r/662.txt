the, history, of, technology, is, the, history, of, the, invention, of, tools, and, techniques, by, humans, technology, includes, methods, ranging, from, simple, stone, tools, to, the, complex, genetic, engineering, and, information, technology, that, has, emerged, since, the, 1980s, the, term, technology, comes, from, the, greek, word, techne, meaning, art, and, craft, and, the, word, logos, meaning, word, and, speech, it, was, first, used, to, describe, applied, arts, but, it, is, now, used, to, describe, advancements, and, changes, that, affect, the, environment, around, us, new, knowledge, has, enabled, people, to, create, new, tools, and, conversely, many, scientific, endeavors, are, made, possible, by, new, technologies, for, example, scientific, instruments, which, allow, us, to, study, nature, in, more, detail, than, our, natural, senses, since, much, of, technology, is, applied, science, technical, history, is, connected, to, the, history, of, science, since, technology, uses, resources, technical, history, is, tightly, connected, to, economic, history, from, those, resources, technology, produces, other, resources, including, technological, artifacts, used, in, everyday, life, technological, change, affects, and, is, affected, by, a, society, s, cultural, traditions, it, is, a, force, for, economic, growth, and, a, means, to, develop, and, project, economic, political, military, power, and, wealth, many, sociologists, and, anthropologists, have, created, social, theories, dealing, with, social, and, cultural, evolution, some, like, lewis, h, morgan, leslie, white, and, gerhard, lenski, have, declared, technological, progress, to, be, the, primary, factor, driving, the, development, of, human, civilization, morgan, s, concept, of, three, major, stages, of, social, evolution, savagery, barbarism, and, civilization, can, be, divided, by, technological, milestones, such, as, fire, white, argued, the, measure, by, which, to, judge, the, evolution, of, culture, was, energy, for, white, the, primary, function, of, culture, is, to, harness, and, control, energy, white, differentiates, between, five, stages, of, human, development, in, the, first, people, use, the, energy, of, their, own, muscles, in, the, second, they, use, the, energy, of, domesticated, animals, in, the, third, they, use, the, energy, of, plants, agricultural, revolution, in, the, fourth, they, learn, to, use, the, energy, of, natural, resources, coal, oil, gas, in, the, fifth, they, harness, nuclear, energy, white, introduced, the, formula, p, e, t, where, p, is, the, development, index, e, is, a, measure, of, energy, consumed, and, t, is, the, measure, of, the, efficiency, of, technical, factors, using, the, energy, in, his, own, words, culture, evolves, as, the, amount, of, energy, harnessed, per, capita, per, year, is, increased, or, as, the, efficiency, of, the, instrumental, means, of, putting, the, energy, to, work, is, increased, nikolai, kardashev, extrapolated, his, theory, creating, the, kardashev, scale, which, categorizes, the, energy, use, of, advanced, civilizations, lenski, s, approach, focuses, on, information, the, more, information, and, knowledge, especially, allowing, the, shaping, of, natural, environment, a, given, society, has, the, more, advanced, it, is, he, identifies, four, stages, of, human, development, based, on, advances, in, the, history, of, communication, in, the, first, stage, information, is, passed, by, genes, in, the, second, when, humans, gain, sentience, they, can, learn, and, pass, information, through, experience, in, the, third, the, humans, start, using, signs, and, develop, logic, in, the, fourth, they, can, create, symbols, develop, language, and, writing, advancements, in, communications, technology, translate, into, advancements, in, the, economic, system, and, political, system, distribution, of, wealth, social, inequality, and, other, spheres, of, social, life, he, also, differentiates, societies, based, on, their, level, of, technology, communication, and, economy, in, economics, productivity, is, a, measure, of, technological, progress, productivity, increases, when, fewer, inputs, classically, labor, and, capital, but, some, measures, include, energy, and, materials, are, used, in, the, production, of, a, unit, of, output, another, indicator, of, technological, progress, is, the, development, of, new, products, and, services, which, is, necessary, to, offset, unemployment, that, would, otherwise, result, as, labor, inputs, are, reduced, in, developed, countries, productivity, growth, has, been, slowing, since, the, late, 1970s, however, productivity, growth, was, higher, in, some, economic, sectors, such, as, manufacturing, for, example, employment, in, manufacturing, in, the, united, states, declined, from, over, 30, in, the, 1940s, to, just, over, 10, 70, years, later, similar, changes, occurred, in, other, developed, countries, this, stage, is, referred, to, as, post, industrial, in, the, late, 1970s, sociologists, and, anthropologists, like, alvin, toffler, author, of, future, shock, daniel, bell, and, john, naisbitt, have, approached, the, theories, of, post, industrial, societies, arguing, that, the, current, era, of, industrial, society, is, coming, to, an, end, and, services, and, information, are, becoming, more, important, than, industry, and, goods, some, extreme, visions, of, the, post, industrial, society, especially, in, fiction, are, strikingly, similar, to, the, visions, of, near, and, post, singularity, societies, the, following, is, a, summary, of, the, history, of, technology, by, time, period, and, geography, during, most, of, the, paleolithic, the, bulk, of, the, stone, age, all, humans, had, a, lifestyle, which, involved, limited, tools, and, few, permanent, settlements, the, first, major, technologies, were, tied, to, survival, hunting, and, food, preparation, stone, tools, and, weapons, fire, and, clothing, were, technological, developments, of, major, importance, during, this, period, human, ancestors, have, been, using, stone, and, other, tools, since, long, before, the, emergence, of, homo, sapiens, approximately, 300, 000, years, ago, the, earliest, direct, evidence, of, tool, usage, was, found, in, ethiopia, within, the, great, rift, valley, dating, back, to, 2, 5, million, years, ago, the, earliest, methods, of, stone, tool, making, known, as, the, oldowan, industry, date, back, to, at, least, 2, 3, million, years, ago, this, era, of, stone, tool, use, is, called, the, paleolithic, or, old, stone, age, and, spans, all, of, human, history, up, to, the, development, of, agriculture, approximately, 12, 000, years, ago, to, make, a, stone, tool, a, core, of, hard, stone, with, specific, flaking, properties, such, as, flint, was, struck, with, a, hammerstone, this, flaking, produced, sharp, edges, which, could, be, used, as, tools, primarily, in, the, form, of, choppers, or, scrapers, these, tools, greatly, aided, the, early, humans, in, their, hunter, gatherer, lifestyle, to, perform, a, variety, of, tasks, including, butchering, carcasses, and, breaking, bones, to, get, at, the, marrow, chopping, wood, cracking, open, nuts, skinning, an, animal, for, its, hide, and, even, forming, other, tools, out, of, softer, materials, such, as, bone, and, wood, the, earliest, stone, tools, were, irrelevant, being, little, more, than, a, fractured, rock, in, the, acheulian, era, beginning, approximately, 1, 65, million, years, ago, methods, of, working, these, stones, into, specific, shapes, such, as, hand, axes, emerged, this, early, stone, age, is, described, as, the, lower, paleolithic, the, middle, paleolithic, approximately, 300, 000, years, ago, saw, the, introduction, of, the, prepared, core, technique, where, multiple, blades, could, be, rapidly, formed, from, a, single, core, stone, the, upper, paleolithic, beginning, approximately, 40, 000, years, ago, saw, the, introduction, of, pressure, flaking, where, a, wood, bone, or, antler, punch, could, be, used, to, shape, a, stone, very, finely, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, about, 10, 000, years, ago, is, taken, as, the, end, point, of, the, upper, paleolithic, and, the, beginning, of, the, epipaleolithic, mesolithic, the, mesolithic, technology, included, the, use, of, microliths, as, composite, stone, tools, along, with, wood, bone, and, antler, tools, the, later, stone, age, during, which, the, rudiments, of, agricultural, technology, were, developed, is, called, the, neolithic, period, during, this, period, polished, stone, tools, were, made, from, a, variety, of, hard, rocks, such, as, flint, jade, jadeite, and, greenstone, largely, by, working, exposures, as, quarries, but, later, the, valuable, rocks, were, pursued, by, tunneling, underground, the, first, steps, in, mining, technology, the, polished, axes, were, used, for, forest, clearance, and, the, establishment, of, crop, farming, and, were, so, effective, as, to, remain, in, use, when, bronze, and, iron, appeared, these, stone, axes, were, used, alongside, a, continued, use, of, stone, tools, such, as, a, range, of, projectiles, knives, and, scrapers, as, well, as, tools, made, organic, materials, such, as, wood, bone, and, antler, stone, age, cultures, developed, music, and, engaged, in, organized, warfare, stone, age, humans, developed, ocean, worthy, outrigger, canoe, technology, leading, to, migration, across, the, malay, archipelago, across, the, indian, ocean, to, madagascar, and, also, across, the, pacific, ocean, which, required, knowledge, of, the, ocean, currents, weather, patterns, sailing, and, celestial, navigation, although, paleolithic, cultures, left, no, written, records, the, shift, from, nomadic, life, to, settlement, and, agriculture, can, be, inferred, from, a, range, of, archaeological, evidence, such, evidence, includes, ancient, tools, cave, paintings, and, other, prehistoric, art, such, as, the, venus, of, willendorf, human, remains, also, provide, direct, evidence, both, through, the, examination, of, bones, and, the, study, of, mummies, scientists, and, historians, have, been, able, to, form, significant, inferences, about, the, lifestyle, and, culture, of, various, prehistoric, peoples, and, especially, their, technology, metallic, copper, occurs, on, the, surface, of, weathered, copper, ore, deposits, and, copper, was, used, before, copper, smelting, was, known, copper, smelting, is, believed, to, have, originated, when, the, technology, of, pottery, kilns, allowed, sufficiently, high, temperatures, the, concentration, of, various, elements, such, as, arsenic, increase, with, depth, in, copper, ore, deposits, and, smelting, of, these, ores, yields, arsenical, bronze, which, can, be, sufficiently, work, hardened, to, be, suitable, for, making, tools, bronze, is, an, alloy, of, copper, with, tin, the, latter, being, found, in, relatively, few, deposits, globally, caused, a, long, time, to, elapse, before, true, tin, bronze, became, widespread, see, tin, sources, and, trade, in, ancient, times, bronze, was, a, major, advancement, over, stone, as, a, material, for, making, tools, both, because, of, its, mechanical, properties, like, strength, and, ductility, and, because, it, could, be, cast, in, molds, to, make, intricately, shaped, objects, bronze, significantly, advanced, shipbuilding, technology, with, better, tools, and, bronze, nails, bronze, nails, replaced, the, old, method, of, attaching, boards, of, the, hull, with, cord, woven, through, drilled, holes, better, ships, enabled, long, distance, trade, and, the, advance, of, civilization, this, technological, trend, apparently, began, in, the, fertile, crescent, and, spread, outward, over, time, these, developments, were, not, and, still, are, not, universal, the, three, age, system, does, not, accurately, describe, the, technology, history, of, groups, outside, of, eurasia, and, does, not, apply, at, all, in, the, case, of, some, isolated, populations, such, as, the, spinifex, people, the, sentinelese, and, various, amazonian, tribes, which, still, make, use, of, stone, age, technology, and, have, not, developed, agricultural, or, metal, technology, these, villages, preserve, traditional, customs, in, the, face, of, global, modernity, exhibiting, a, remarkable, resistance, to, the, rapid, advancement, of, technology, before, iron, smelting, was, developed, the, only, iron, was, obtained, from, meteorites, and, is, usually, identified, by, having, nickel, content, meteoric, iron, was, rare, and, valuable, but, was, sometimes, used, to, make, tools, and, other, implements, such, as, fish, hooks, the, iron, age, involved, the, adoption, of, iron, smelting, technology, it, generally, replaced, bronze, and, made, it, possible, to, produce, tools, which, were, stronger, lighter, and, cheaper, to, make, than, bronze, equivalents, the, raw, materials, to, make, iron, such, as, ore, and, limestone, are, far, more, abundant, than, copper, and, especially, tin, ores, consequently, iron, was, produced, in, many, areas, it, was, not, possible, to, mass, manufacture, steel, or, pure, iron, because, of, the, high, temperatures, required, furnaces, could, reach, melting, temperature, but, the, crucibles, and, molds, needed, for, melting, and, casting, had, not, been, developed, steel, could, be, produced, by, forging, bloomery, iron, to, reduce, the, carbon, content, in, a, somewhat, controllable, way, but, steel, produced, by, this, method, was, not, homogeneous, in, many, eurasian, cultures, the, iron, age, was, the, last, major, step, before, the, development, of, written, language, though, again, this, was, not, universally, the, case, in, europe, large, hill, forts, were, built, either, as, a, refuge, in, time, of, war, or, sometimes, as, permanent, settlements, in, some, cases, existing, forts, from, the, bronze, age, were, expanded, and, enlarged, the, pace, of, land, clearance, using, the, more, effective, iron, axes, increased, providing, more, farmland, to, support, the, growing, population, mesopotamia, modern, iraq, and, its, peoples, sumerians, akkadians, assyrians, and, babylonians, lived, in, cities, from, c, 4000, bc, and, developed, a, sophisticated, architecture, in, mud, brick, and, stone, including, the, use, of, the, true, arch, the, walls, of, babylon, were, so, massive, they, were, quoted, as, a, wonder, of, the, world, they, developed, extensive, water, systems, canals, for, transport, and, irrigation, in, the, alluvial, south, and, catchment, systems, stretching, for, tens, of, kilometers, in, the, hilly, north, their, palaces, had, sophisticated, drainage, systems, writing, was, invented, in, mesopotamia, using, the, cuneiform, script, many, records, on, clay, tablets, and, stone, inscriptions, have, survived, these, civilizations, were, early, adopters, of, bronze, technologies, which, they, used, for, tools, weapons, and, monumental, statuary, by, 1200, bc, they, could, cast, objects, 5, m, long, in, a, single, piece, several, of, the, six, classic, simple, machines, were, invented, in, mesopotamia, mesopotamians, have, been, credited, with, the, invention, of, the, wheel, the, wheel, and, axle, mechanism, first, appeared, with, the, potter, s, wheel, invented, in, mesopotamia, modern, iraq, during, the, 5th, millennium, bc, this, led, to, the, invention, of, the, wheeled, vehicle, in, mesopotamia, during, the, early, 4th, millennium, bc, depictions, of, wheeled, wagons, found, on, clay, tablet, pictographs, at, the, eanna, district, of, uruk, are, dated, between, 3700, and, 3500, bc, the, lever, was, used, in, the, shadoof, water, lifting, device, the, first, crane, machine, which, appeared, in, mesopotamia, circa, 3000, bc, and, then, in, ancient, egyptian, technology, circa, 2000, bc, the, earliest, evidence, of, pulleys, date, back, to, mesopotamia, in, the, early, 2nd, millennium, bc, the, screw, the, last, of, the, simple, machines, to, be, invented, first, appeared, in, mesopotamia, during, the, neo, assyrian, period, 911, 609, bc, the, assyrian, king, sennacherib, 704, 681, bc, claims, to, have, invented, automatic, sluices, and, to, have, been, the, first, to, use, water, screw, pumps, of, up, to, 30, tons, weight, which, were, cast, using, two, part, clay, molds, rather, than, by, the, lost, wax, process, the, jerwan, aqueduct, c, 688, bc, is, made, with, stone, arches, and, lined, with, waterproof, concrete, the, babylonian, astronomical, diaries, spanned, 800, years, they, enabled, meticulous, astronomers, to, plot, the, motions, of, the, planets, and, to, predict, eclipses, the, earliest, evidence, of, water, wheels, and, watermills, date, back, to, the, ancient, near, east, in, the, 4th, century, bc, specifically, in, the, persian, empire, before, 350, bc, in, the, regions, of, mesopotamia, iraq, and, persia, iran, this, pioneering, use, of, water, power, constituted, the, first, human, devised, motive, force, not, to, rely, on, muscle, power, besides, the, sail, the, egyptians, known, for, building, pyramids, centuries, before, the, creation, of, modern, tools, invented, and, used, many, simple, machines, such, as, the, ramp, to, aid, construction, processes, historians, and, archaeologists, have, found, evidence, that, the, pyramids, were, built, using, three, of, what, is, called, the, six, simple, machines, from, which, all, machines, are, based, these, machines, are, the, inclined, plane, the, wedge, and, the, lever, which, allowed, the, ancient, egyptians, to, move, millions, of, limestone, blocks, which, weighed, approximately, 3, 5, tons, 7, 000, lbs, each, into, place, to, create, structures, like, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, which, is, 481, feet, 147, meters, high, they, also, made, writing, medium, similar, to, paper, from, papyrus, which, joshua, mark, states, is, the, foundation, for, modern, paper, papyrus, is, a, plant, cyperus, papyrus, which, grew, in, plentiful, amounts, in, the, egyptian, delta, and, throughout, the, nile, river, valley, during, ancient, times, the, papyrus, was, harvested, by, field, workers, and, brought, to, processing, centers, where, it, was, cut, into, thin, strips, the, strips, were, then, laid, out, side, by, side, and, covered, in, plant, resin, the, second, layer, of, strips, was, laid, on, perpendicularly, then, both, pressed, together, until, the, sheet, was, dry, the, sheets, were, then, joined, to, form, a, roll, and, later, used, for, writing, egyptian, society, made, several, significant, advances, during, dynastic, periods, in, many, areas, of, technology, according, to, hossam, elanzeery, they, were, the, first, civilization, to, use, timekeeping, devices, such, as, sundials, shadow, clocks, and, obelisks, and, successfully, leveraged, their, knowledge, of, astronomy, to, create, a, calendar, model, that, society, still, uses, today, they, developed, shipbuilding, technology, that, saw, them, progress, from, papyrus, reed, vessels, to, cedar, wood, ships, while, also, pioneering, the, use, of, rope, trusses, and, stem, mounted, rudders, the, egyptians, also, used, their, knowledge, of, anatomy, to, lay, the, foundation, for, many, modern, medical, techniques, and, practiced, the, earliest, known, version, of, neuroscience, elanzeery, also, states, that, they, used, and, furthered, mathematical, science, as, evidenced, in, the, building, of, the, pyramids, ancient, egyptians, also, invented, and, pioneered, many, food, technologies, that, have, become, the, basis, of, modern, food, technology, processes, based, on, paintings, and, reliefs, found, in, tombs, as, well, as, archaeological, artifacts, scholars, like, paul, t, nicholson, believe, that, the, ancient, egyptians, established, systematic, farming, practices, engaged, in, cereal, processing, brewed, beer, and, baked, bread, processed, meat, practiced, viticulture, and, created, the, basis, for, modern, wine, production, and, created, condiments, to, complement, preserve, and, mask, the, flavors, of, their, food, the, indus, valley, civilization, situated, in, a, resource, rich, area, in, modern, pakistan, and, northwestern, india, is, notable, for, its, early, application, of, city, planning, sanitation, technologies, and, plumbing, indus, valley, construction, and, architecture, called, vaastu, shastra, suggests, a, thorough, understanding, of, materials, engineering, hydrology, and, sanitation, the, chinese, made, many, first, known, discoveries, and, developments, major, technological, contributions, from, china, include, the, earliest, know, form, of, the, binary, code, and, epigenetic, sequencing, early, seismological, detectors, matches, paper, helicopter, rotor, raised, relief, map, the, double, action, piston, pump, cast, iron, water, powered, blast, furnace, bellows, the, iron, plough, the, multi, tube, seed, drill, the, wheelbarrow, the, parachute, the, compass, the, rudder, the, crossbow, the, south, pointing, chariot, and, gunpowder, china, also, developed, deep, well, drilling, which, they, used, to, extract, brine, for, making, salt, some, of, these, wells, which, were, as, deep, as, 900, meters, produced, natural, gas, which, was, used, for, evaporating, brine, other, chinese, discoveries, and, inventions, from, the, medieval, period, include, block, printing, movable, type, printing, phosphorescent, paint, endless, power, chain, drive, and, the, clock, escapement, mechanism, the, solid, fuel, rocket, was, invented, in, china, about, 1150, nearly, 200, years, after, the, invention, of, gunpowder, which, acted, as, the, rocket, s, fuel, decades, before, the, west, s, age, of, exploration, the, chinese, emperors, of, the, ming, dynasty, also, sent, large, fleets, on, maritime, voyages, some, reaching, africa, the, hellenistic, period, of, mediterranean, history, began, in, the, 4th, century, bc, with, alexander, s, conquests, which, led, to, the, emergence, of, a, hellenistic, civilization, representing, a, synthesis, of, greek, and, near, eastern, cultures, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, region, including, the, balkans, levant, and, egypt, with, ptolemaic, egypt, as, its, intellectual, center, and, greek, as, the, lingua, franca, the, hellenistic, civilization, included, greek, egyptian, jewish, persian, and, phoenician, scholars, and, engineers, who, wrote, in, greek, hellenistic, engineers, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, were, responsible, for, a, number, of, inventions, and, improvements, to, existing, technology, the, hellenistic, period, saw, a, sharp, increase, in, technological, advancement, fostered, by, a, climate, of, openness, to, new, ideas, the, blossoming, of, a, mechanistic, philosophy, and, the, establishment, of, the, library, of, alexandria, in, ptolemaic, egypt, and, its, close, association, with, the, adjacent, museion, in, contrast, to, the, typically, anonymous, inventors, of, earlier, ages, ingenious, minds, such, as, archimedes, philo, of, byzantium, heron, ctesibius, and, archytas, remain, known, by, name, to, posterity, ancient, agriculture, as, in, any, period, prior, to, the, modern, age, the, primary, mode, of, production, and, subsistence, and, its, irrigation, methods, were, considerably, advanced, by, the, invention, and, widespread, application, of, a, number, of, previously, unknown, water, lifting, devices, such, as, the, vertical, water, wheel, the, compartmented, wheel, the, water, turbine, archimedes, screw, the, bucket, chain, and, pot, garland, the, force, pump, the, suction, pump, the, double, action, piston, pump, and, quite, possibly, the, chain, pump, in, music, the, water, organ, invented, by, ctesibius, and, subsequently, improved, constituted, the, earliest, instance, of, a, keyboard, instrument, in, time, keeping, the, introduction, of, the, inflow, clepsydra, and, its, mechanization, by, the, dial, and, pointer, the, application, of, a, feedback, system, and, the, escapement, mechanism, far, superseded, the, earlier, outflow, clepsydra, innovations, in, mechanical, technology, included, the, newly, devised, right, angled, gear, which, would, become, particularly, important, to, the, operation, of, mechanical, devices, hellenistic, engineers, also, devised, automata, such, as, suspended, ink, pots, automatic, washstands, and, doors, primarily, as, toys, which, however, featured, new, useful, mechanisms, such, as, the, cam, and, gimbals, the, antikythera, mechanism, a, kind, of, analogous, computer, working, with, a, differential, gear, and, the, astrolabe, both, show, great, refinement, in, astronomical, science, in, other, fields, ancient, greek, innovations, include, the, catapult, and, the, gastraphetes, crossbow, in, warfare, hollow, bronze, casting, in, metallurgy, the, dioptra, for, surveying, in, infrastructure, the, lighthouse, central, heating, a, tunnel, excavated, from, both, ends, by, scientific, calculations, and, the, ship, trackway, in, transport, great, progress, resulted, from, the, invention, of, the, winch, and, the, odometer, further, newly, created, techniques, and, items, were, spiral, staircases, the, chain, drive, sliding, calipers, and, showers, the, roman, empire, expanded, from, italia, across, the, entire, mediterranean, region, between, the, 1st, century, bc, and, 1st, century, ad, its, most, advanced, and, economically, productive, provinces, outside, of, italia, were, the, eastern, roman, provinces, in, the, balkans, asia, minor, egypt, and, the, levant, with, roman, egypt, in, particular, being, the, wealthiest, roman, province, outside, of, italia, the, roman, empire, developed, an, intensive, and, sophisticated, agriculture, expanded, upon, existing, iron, working, technology, created, laws, providing, for, individual, ownership, advanced, stone, masonry, technology, advanced, road, building, exceeded, only, in, the, 19th, century, military, engineering, civil, engineering, spinning, and, weaving, and, several, different, machines, like, the, gallic, reaper, that, helped, to, increase, productivity, in, many, sectors, of, the, roman, economy, roman, engineers, were, the, first, to, build, monumental, arches, amphitheatres, aqueducts, public, baths, true, arch, bridges, harbours, reservoirs, and, dams, vaults, and, domes, on, a, very, large, scale, across, their, empire, notable, roman, inventions, include, the, book, codex, glass, blowing, and, concrete, because, rome, was, located, on, a, volcanic, peninsula, with, sand, which, contained, suitable, crystalline, grains, the, concrete, which, the, romans, formulated, was, especially, durable, some, of, their, buildings, have, lasted, 2000, years, to, the, present, day, in, roman, egypt, the, inventor, hero, of, alexandria, was, the, first, to, experiment, with, a, wind, powered, mechanical, device, see, heron, s, windwheel, and, even, created, the, earliest, steam, powered, device, the, aeolipile, opening, up, new, possibilities, in, harnessing, natural, forces, he, also, devised, a, vending, machine, however, his, inventions, were, primarily, toys, rather, than, practical, machines, the, engineering, skills, of, the, inca, and, maya, were, great, even, by, today, s, standards, an, example, of, this, exceptional, engineering, is, the, use, of, pieces, weighing, upwards, of, one, ton, in, their, stonework, placed, together, so, that, not, even, a, blade, can, fit, into, the, cracks, inca, villages, used, irrigation, canals, and, drainage, systems, making, agriculture, very, efficient, while, some, claim, that, the, incas, were, the, first, inventors, of, hydroponics, their, agricultural, technology, was, still, soil, based, if, advanced, though, the, maya, civilization, did, not, incorporate, metallurgy, or, wheel, technology, in, their, architectural, constructions, they, developed, complex, writing, and, astronomical, systems, and, created, beautiful, sculptural, works, in, stone, and, flint, like, the, inca, the, maya, also, had, command, of, fairly, advanced, agricultural, and, construction, technology, the, maya, are, also, responsible, for, creating, the, first, pressurized, water, system, in, mesoamerica, located, in, the, maya, site, of, palenque, the, main, contribution, of, the, aztec, rule, was, a, system, of, communications, between, the, conquered, cities, and, the, ubiquity, of, the, ingenious, agricultural, technology, of, chinampas, in, mesoamerica, without, draft, animals, for, transport, nor, as, a, result, wheeled, vehicles, the, roads, were, designed, for, travel, on, foot, just, as, in, the, inca, and, mayan, civilizations, the, aztec, subsequently, to, the, maya, inherited, many, of, the, technologies, and, intellectual, advancements, of, their, predecessors, the, olmec, see, native, american, inventions, and, innovations, one, of, the, most, significant, developments, of, the, medieval, were, economies, in, which, water, and, wind, power, were, more, significant, than, animal, and, human, muscle, power, 38, most, water, and, wind, power, was, used, for, milling, grain, water, power, was, also, used, for, blowing, air, in, blast, furnace, pulping, rags, for, paper, making, and, for, felting, wool, the, domesday, book, recorded, 5, 624, water, mills, in, great, britain, in, 1086, being, about, one, per, thirty, families, the, muslim, caliphates, united, in, trade, large, areas, that, had, previously, traded, little, including, the, middle, east, north, africa, central, asia, the, iberian, peninsula, and, parts, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, science, and, technology, of, previous, empires, in, the, region, including, the, mesopotamian, egyptian, persian, hellenistic, and, roman, empires, were, inherited, by, the, muslim, world, where, arabic, replaced, syriac, persian, and, greek, as, the, lingua, franca, of, the, region, significant, advances, were, made, in, the, region, during, the, islamic, golden, age, 8th, 16th, centuries, the, arab, agricultural, revolution, occurred, during, this, period, it, was, a, transformation, in, agriculture, from, the, 8th, to, the, 13th, century, in, the, islamic, region, of, the, old, world, the, economy, established, by, arab, and, other, muslim, traders, across, the, old, world, enabled, the, diffusion, of, many, crops, and, farming, techniques, throughout, the, islamic, world, as, well, as, the, adaptation, of, crops, and, techniques, from, and, to, regions, outside, it, advances, were, made, in, animal, husbandry, irrigation, and, farming, with, the, help, of, new, technology, such, as, the, windmill, these, changes, made, agriculture, much, more, productive, supporting, population, growth, urbanisation, and, increased, stratification, of, society, muslim, engineers, in, the, islamic, world, made, wide, use, of, hydropower, along, with, early, uses, of, tidal, power, wind, power, fossil, fuels, such, as, petroleum, and, large, factory, complexes, tiraz, in, arabic, a, variety, of, industrial, mills, were, employed, in, the, islamic, world, including, fulling, mills, gristmills, hullers, sawmills, ship, mills, stamp, mills, steel, mills, and, tide, mills, by, the, 11th, century, every, province, throughout, the, islamic, world, had, these, industrial, mills, in, operation, muslim, engineers, also, employed, water, turbines, and, gears, in, mills, and, water, raising, machines, and, pioneered, the, use, of, dams, as, a, source, of, water, power, used, to, provide, additional, power, to, watermills, and, water, raising, machines, many, of, these, technologies, were, transferred, to, medieval, europe, wind, powered, machines, used, to, grind, grain, and, pump, water, the, windmill, and, wind, pump, first, appeared, in, what, are, now, iran, afghanistan, and, pakistan, by, the, 9th, century, they, were, used, to, grind, grains, and, draw, up, water, and, used, in, the, gristmilling, and, sugarcane, industries, sugar, mills, first, appeared, in, the, medieval, islamic, world, they, were, first, driven, by, watermills, and, then, windmills, from, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, in, what, are, today, afghanistan, pakistan, and, iran, crops, such, as, almonds, and, citrus, fruit, were, brought, to, europe, through, al, andalus, and, sugar, cultivation, was, gradually, adopted, across, europe, arab, merchants, dominated, trade, in, the, indian, ocean, until, the, arrival, of, the, portuguese, in, the, 16th, century, the, muslim, world, adopted, papermaking, from, china, the, earliest, paper, mills, appeared, in, abbasid, era, baghdad, during, 794, 795, the, knowledge, of, gunpowder, was, also, transmitted, from, china, via, predominantly, islamic, countries, where, formulas, for, pure, potassium, nitrate, were, developed, the, spinning, wheel, was, invented, in, the, islamic, world, by, the, early, 11th, century, it, was, later, widely, adopted, in, europe, where, it, was, adapted, into, the, spinning, jenny, a, key, device, during, the, industrial, revolution, the, crankshaft, was, invented, by, al, jazari, in, 1206, and, is, central, to, modern, machinery, such, as, the, steam, engine, internal, combustion, engine, and, automatic, controls, the, camshaft, was, also, first, described, by, al, jazari, in, 1206, early, programmable, machines, were, also, invented, in, the, muslim, world, the, first, music, sequencer, a, programmable, musical, instrument, was, an, automated, flute, player, invented, by, the, banu, musa, brothers, described, in, their, book, of, ingenious, devices, in, the, 9th, century, in, 1206, al, jazari, invented, programmable, automata, robots, he, described, four, automaton, musicians, including, two, drummers, operated, by, a, programmable, drum, machine, where, the, drummer, could, be, made, to, play, different, rhythms, and, different, drum, patterns, the, castle, clock, a, hydropowered, mechanical, astronomical, clock, invented, by, al, jazari, was, an, early, programmable, analog, computer, in, the, ottoman, empire, a, practical, impulse, steam, turbine, was, invented, in, 1551, by, taqi, ad, din, muhammad, ibn, ma, ruf, in, ottoman, egypt, he, described, a, method, for, rotating, a, spit, by, means, of, a, jet, of, steam, playing, on, rotary, vanes, around, the, periphery, of, a, wheel, known, as, a, steam, jack, a, similar, device, for, rotating, a, spit, was, also, later, described, by, john, wilkins, in, 1648, while, medieval, technology, has, been, long, depicted, as, a, step, backward, in, the, evolution, of, western, technology, a, generation, of, medievalists, like, the, american, historian, of, science, lynn, white, stressed, from, the, 1940s, onwards, the, innovative, character, of, many, medieval, techniques, genuine, medieval, contributions, include, for, example, mechanical, clocks, spectacles, and, vertical, windmills, medieval, ingenuity, was, also, displayed, in, the, invention, of, seemingly, inconspicuous, items, like, the, watermark, or, the, functional, button, in, navigation, the, foundation, to, the, subsequent, age, of, exploration, was, laid, by, the, introduction, of, pintle, and, gudgeon, rudders, lateen, sails, the, dry, compass, the, horseshoe, and, the, astrolabe, significant, advances, were, also, made, in, military, technology, with, the, development, of, plate, armour, steel, crossbows, and, cannon, the, middle, ages, are, perhaps, best, known, for, their, architectural, heritage, while, the, invention, of, the, rib, vault, and, pointed, arch, gave, rise, to, the, high, rising, gothic, style, the, ubiquitous, medieval, fortifications, gave, the, era, the, almost, proverbial, title, of, the, age, of, castles, papermaking, a, 2nd, century, chinese, technology, was, carried, to, the, middle, east, when, a, group, of, chinese, papermakers, were, captured, in, the, 8th, century, papermaking, technology, was, spread, to, europe, by, the, umayyad, conquest, of, hispania, a, paper, mill, was, established, in, sicily, in, the, 12th, century, in, europe, the, fiber, to, make, pulp, for, making, paper, was, obtained, from, linen, and, cotton, rags, lynn, townsend, white, jr, credited, the, spinning, wheel, with, increasing, the, supply, of, rags, which, led, to, cheap, paper, which, was, a, factor, in, the, development, of, printing, before, the, development, of, modern, engineering, mathematics, was, used, by, artisans, and, craftsmen, such, as, millwrights, clock, makers, instrument, makers, and, surveyors, aside, from, these, professions, universities, were, not, believed, to, have, had, much, practical, significance, to, technology, 32, a, standard, reference, for, the, state, of, mechanical, arts, during, the, renaissance, is, given, in, the, mining, engineering, treatise, de, re, metallica, 1556, which, also, contains, sections, on, geology, mining, and, chemistry, de, re, metallica, was, the, standard, chemistry, reference, for, the, next, 180, years, among, the, water, powered, mechanical, devices, in, use, were, ore, stamping, mills, forge, hammers, blast, bellows, and, suction, pumps, due, to, the, casting, of, cannon, the, blast, furnace, came, into, widespread, use, in, france, in, the, mid, 15th, century, the, blast, furnace, had, been, used, in, china, since, the, 4th, century, bc, the, invention, of, the, movable, cast, metal, type, printing, press, whose, pressing, mechanism, was, adapted, from, an, olive, screw, press, c, 1441, lead, to, a, tremendous, increase, in, the, number, of, books, and, the, number, of, titles, published, movable, ceramic, type, had, been, used, in, china, for, a, few, centuries, and, woodblock, printing, dated, back, even, further, the, era, is, marked, by, such, profound, technical, advancements, like, linear, perceptivity, double, shell, domes, or, bastion, fortresses, note, books, of, the, renaissance, artist, engineers, such, as, taccola, and, leonardo, da, vinci, give, a, deep, insight, into, the, mechanical, technology, then, known, and, applied, architects, and, engineers, were, inspired, by, the, structures, of, ancient, rome, and, men, like, brunelleschi, created, the, large, dome, of, florence, cathedral, as, a, result, he, was, awarded, one, of, the, first, patents, ever, issued, to, protect, an, ingenious, crane, he, designed, to, raise, the, large, masonry, stones, to, the, top, of, the, structure, military, technology, developed, rapidly, with, the, widespread, use, of, the, cross, bow, and, ever, more, powerful, artillery, as, the, city, states, of, italy, were, usually, in, conflict, with, one, another, powerful, families, like, the, medici, were, strong, patrons, of, the, arts, and, sciences, renaissance, science, spawned, the, scientific, revolution, science, and, technology, began, a, cycle, of, mutual, advancement, an, improved, sailing, ship, the, nau, or, carrack, enabled, the, age, of, exploration, with, the, european, colonization, of, the, americas, epitomized, by, francis, bacon, s, new, atlantis, pioneers, like, vasco, da, gama, cabral, magellan, and, christopher, columbus, explored, the, world, in, search, of, new, trade, routes, for, their, goods, and, contacts, with, africa, india, and, china, to, shorten, the, journey, compared, with, traditional, routes, overland, they, produced, new, maps, and, charts, which, enabled, following, mariners, to, explore, further, with, greater, confidence, navigation, was, generally, difficult, however, owing, to, the, problem, of, longitude, and, the, absence, of, accurate, chronometers, european, powers, rediscovered, the, idea, of, the, civil, code, lost, since, the, time, of, the, ancient, greeks, the, stocking, frame, which, was, invented, in, 1598, increased, a, knitter, s, number, of, knots, per, minute, from, 100, to, 1000, mines, were, becoming, increasingly, deep, and, were, expensive, to, drain, with, horse, powered, bucket, and, chain, pumps, and, wooden, piston, pumps, some, mines, used, as, many, as, 500, horses, horse, powered, pumps, were, replaced, by, the, savery, steam, pump, 1698, and, the, newcomen, steam, engine, 1712, the, revolution, was, driven, by, cheap, energy, in, the, form, of, coal, produced, in, ever, increasing, amounts, from, the, abundant, resources, of, britain, the, british, industrial, revolution, is, characterized, by, developments, in, the, areas, of, textile, machinery, mining, metallurgy, transport, and, the, invention, of, machine, tools, before, invention, of, machinery, to, spin, yarn, and, weave, cloth, spinning, was, done, using, the, spinning, wheel, and, weaving, was, done, on, a, hand, and, foot, operated, loom, it, took, from, three, to, five, spinners, to, supply, one, weaver, the, invention, of, the, flying, shuttle, in, 1733, doubled, the, output, of, a, weaver, creating, a, shortage, of, spinners, the, spinning, frame, for, wool, was, invented, in, 1738, the, spinning, jenny, invented, in, 1764, was, a, machine, that, used, multiple, spinning, wheels, however, it, produced, low, quality, thread, the, water, frame, patented, by, richard, arkwright, in, 1767, produced, a, better, quality, thread, than, the, spinning, jenny, the, spinning, mule, patented, in, 1779, by, samuel, crompton, produced, a, high, quality, thread, the, power, loom, was, invented, by, edmund, cartwright, in, 1787, in, the, mid, 1750s, the, steam, engine, was, applied, to, the, water, power, constrained, iron, copper, and, lead, industries, for, powering, blast, bellows, these, industries, were, located, near, the, mines, some, of, which, were, using, steam, engines, for, mine, pumping, steam, engines, were, too, powerful, for, leather, bellows, so, cast, iron, blowing, cylinders, were, developed, in, 1768, steam, powered, blast, furnaces, achieved, higher, temperatures, allowing, the, use, of, more, lime, in, iron, blast, furnace, feed, lime, rich, slag, was, not, free, flowing, at, the, previously, used, temperatures, with, a, sufficient, lime, ratio, sulfur, from, coal, or, coke, fuel, reacts, with, the, slag, so, that, the, sulfur, does, not, contaminate, the, iron, coal, and, coke, were, cheaper, and, more, abundant, fuel, as, a, result, iron, production, rose, significantly, during, the, last, decades, of, the, 18th, century, coal, converted, to, coke, fueled, higher, temperature, blast, furnaces, and, produced, cast, iron, in, much, larger, amounts, than, before, allowing, the, creation, of, a, range, of, structures, such, as, the, iron, bridge, cheap, coal, meant, that, industry, was, no, longer, constrained, by, water, resources, driving, the, mills, although, it, continued, as, a, valuable, source, of, power, the, steam, engine, helped, drain, the, mines, so, more, coal, reserves, could, be, accessed, and, the, output, of, coal, increased, the, development, of, the, high, pressure, steam, engine, made, locomotives, possible, and, a, transport, revolution, followed, the, steam, engine, which, had, existed, since, the, early, 18th, century, was, practically, applied, to, both, steamboat, and, railway, transportation, the, liverpool, and, manchester, railway, the, first, purpose, built, railway, line, opened, in, 1830, the, rocket, locomotive, of, robert, stephenson, being, one, of, its, first, working, locomotives, used, manufacture, of, ships, pulley, blocks, by, all, metal, machines, at, the, portsmouth, block, mills, in, 1803, instigated, the, age, of, sustained, mass, production, machine, tools, used, by, engineers, to, manufacture, parts, began, in, the, first, decade, of, the, century, notably, by, richard, roberts, and, joseph, whitworth, the, development, of, interchangeable, parts, through, what, is, now, called, the, american, system, of, manufacturing, began, in, the, firearms, industry, at, the, u, s, federal, arsenals, in, the, early, 19th, century, and, became, widely, used, by, the, end, of, the, century, until, the, enlightenment, era, little, progress, was, made, in, water, supply, and, sanitation, and, the, engineering, skills, of, the, romans, were, largely, neglected, throughout, europe, the, first, documented, use, of, sand, filters, to, purify, the, water, supply, dates, to, 1804, when, the, owner, of, a, bleachery, in, paisley, scotland, john, gibb, installed, an, experimental, filter, selling, his, unwanted, surplus, to, the, public, the, first, treated, public, water, supply, in, the, world, was, installed, by, engineer, james, simpson, for, the, chelsea, waterworks, company, in, london, in, 1829, the, first, screw, down, water, tap, was, patented, in, 1845, by, guest, and, chrimes, a, brass, foundry, in, rotherham, the, practice, of, water, treatment, soon, became, mainstream, and, the, virtues, of, the, system, were, made, starkly, apparent, after, the, investigations, of, the, physician, john, snow, during, the, 1854, broad, street, cholera, outbreak, demonstrated, the, role, of, the, water, supply, in, spreading, the, cholera, epidemic, the, 19th, century, saw, astonishing, developments, in, transportation, construction, manufacturing, and, communication, technologies, originating, in, europe, after, a, recession, at, the, end, of, the, 1830s, and, a, general, slowdown, in, major, inventions, the, second, industrial, revolution, was, a, period, of, rapid, innovation, and, industrialization, that, began, in, the, 1860s, or, around, 1870, and, lasted, until, world, war, i, it, included, rapid, development, of, chemical, electrical, petroleum, and, steel, technologies, connected, with, highly, structured, technology, research, telegraphy, developed, into, a, practical, technology, in, the, 19th, century, to, help, run, the, railways, safely, along, with, the, development, of, telegraphy, was, the, patenting, of, the, first, telephone, march, 1876, marks, the, date, that, alexander, graham, bell, officially, patented, his, version, of, an, electric, telegraph, although, bell, is, noted, with, the, creation, of, the, telephone, it, is, still, debated, about, who, actually, developed, the, first, working, model, building, on, improvements, in, vacuum, pumps, and, materials, research, incandescent, light, bulbs, became, practical, for, general, use, in, the, late, 1870s, edison, electric, illuminating, company, a, company, founded, by, thomas, edison, with, financial, backing, from, spencer, trask, built, and, managed, the, first, electricity, network, electrification, was, rated, the, most, important, technical, development, of, the, 20th, century, as, the, foundational, infrastructure, for, modern, civilization, this, invention, had, a, profound, effect, on, the, workplace, because, factories, could, now, have, second, and, third, shift, workers, shoe, production, was, mechanized, during, the, mid, 19th, century, mass, production, of, sewing, machines, and, agricultural, machinery, such, as, reapers, occurred, in, the, mid, to, late, 19th, century, bicycles, were, mass, produced, beginning, in, the, 1880s, steam, powered, factories, became, widespread, although, the, conversion, from, water, power, to, steam, occurred, in, england, earlier, than, in, the, u, s, ironclad, warships, were, found, in, battle, starting, in, the, 1860s, and, played, a, role, in, the, opening, of, japan, and, china, to, trade, with, the, west, between, 1825, and, 1840, the, technology, of, photography, was, introduced, for, much, of, the, rest, of, the, century, many, engineers, and, inventors, tried, to, combine, it, and, the, much, older, technique, of, projection, to, create, a, complete, illusion, or, a, complete, documentation, of, reality, colour, photography, was, usually, included, in, these, ambitions, and, the, introduction, of, the, phonograph, in, 1877, seemed, to, promise, the, addition, of, synchronized, sound, recordings, between, 1887, and, 1894, the, first, successful, short, cinematographic, presentations, were, established, mass, production, brought, automobiles, and, other, high, tech, goods, to, masses, of, consumers, military, research, and, development, sped, advances, including, electronic, computing, and, jet, engines, radio, and, telephony, greatly, improved, and, spread, to, larger, populations, of, users, though, near, universal, access, would, not, be, possible, until, mobile, phones, became, affordable, to, developing, world, residents, in, the, late, 2000s, and, early, 2010s, energy, and, engine, technology, improvements, included, nuclear, power, developed, after, the, manhattan, project, which, heralded, the, new, atomic, age, rocket, development, led, to, long, range, missiles, and, the, first, space, age, that, lasted, from, the, 1950s, with, the, launch, of, sputnik, to, the, mid, 1980s, electrification, spread, rapidly, in, the, 20th, century, at, the, beginning, of, the, century, electric, power, was, for, the, most, part, only, available, to, wealthy, people, in, a, few, major, cities, by, 2019, an, estimated, 87, percent, of, the, world, s, population, had, access, to, electricity, birth, control, also, became, widespread, during, the, 20th, century, electron, microscopes, were, very, powerful, by, the, late, 1970s, and, genetic, theory, and, knowledge, were, expanding, leading, to, developments, in, genetic, engineering, the, first, test, tube, baby, louise, brown, was, born, in, 1978, which, led, to, the, first, successful, gestational, surrogacy, pregnancy, in, 1985, and, the, first, pregnancy, by, icsi, in, 1991, which, is, the, implanting, of, a, single, sperm, into, an, egg, preimplantation, genetic, diagnosis, was, first, performed, in, late, 1989, and, led, to, successful, births, in, july, 1990, these, procedures, have, become, relatively, common, computers, were, connected, by, means, of, local, area, telecom, and, fiber, optic, networks, powered, by, the, optical, amplifier, that, ushered, in, the, information, age, this, optical, networking, technology, exploded, the, capacity, of, the, internet, beginning, in, 1996, with, the, launch, of, the, first, high, capacity, wave, division, multiplexing, wdm, system, by, ciena, corp, wdm, as, the, common, basis, for, telecom, backbone, networks, increased, transmission, capacity, by, orders, of, magnitude, thus, enabling, the, mass, commercialization, and, popularization, of, the, internet, and, its, widespread, impact, on, culture, economics, business, and, society, the, commercial, availability, of, the, first, portable, cell, phone, in, 1981, and, the, first, pocket, sized, phone, in, 1985, both, developed, by, comvik, in, sweden, coupled, with, the, first, transmission, of, data, over, a, cellular, network, by, vodafone, formerly, racal, millicom, in, 1992, were, the, breakthroughs, that, led, directly, to, the, form, and, function, of, smartphones, today, by, 2014, there, were, more, cell, phones, in, use, than, people, on, earth, and, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, states, of, america, has, ruled, that, a, mobile, phone, was, a, private, part, of, a, person, providing, consumers, wireless, access, to, each, other, and, to, the, internet, the, mobile, phone, stimulated, one, of, the, most, important, technology, revolutions, in, human, history, the, human, genome, project, sequenced, and, identified, all, three, billion, chemical, units, in, human, dna, with, a, goal, of, finding, the, genetic, roots, of, disease, and, developing, treatments, the, project, became, feasible, due, to, two, technical, advances, made, during, the, late, 1970s, gene, mapping, by, restriction, fragment, length, polymorphism, rflp, markers, and, dna, sequencing, sequencing, was, invented, by, frederick, sanger, and, separately, by, dr, walter, gilbert, gilbert, also, conceived, of, the, human, genome, project, on, may, 27, 1985, and, first, publicly, advocated, it, in, august, 1985, at, the, first, international, conference, on, genes, and, computers, in, august, 1985, the, u, s, federal, government, sponsored, human, genome, project, began, october, 1, 1990, and, was, declared, complete, in, 2003, the, massive, data, analysis, resources, necessary, for, running, transatlantic, research, programs, such, as, the, human, genome, project, and, the, large, electron, positron, collider, led, to, a, necessity, for, distributed, communications, causing, internet, protocols, to, be, more, widely, adopted, by, researchers, and, also, creating, a, justification, for, tim, berners, lee, to, create, the, world, wide, web, vaccination, spread, rapidly, to, the, developing, world, from, the, 1980s, onward, due, to, many, successful, humanitarian, initiatives, greatly, reducing, childhood, mortality, in, many, poor, countries, with, limited, medical, resources, the, us,
