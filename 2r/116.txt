this, alphabet, was, used, to, write, down, the, udi, language, which, was, probably, the, main, language, of, the, caucasian, albanians, koryun, a, pupil, of, mesrob, mashtots, in, his, book, the, life, of, mashtots, wrote, about, how, his, tutor, created, the, alphabet, then, there, came, and, visited, them, an, elderly, man, an, albanian, named, benjamin, and, he, mashtots, inquired, and, examined, the, barbaric, diction, of, the, albanian, language, and, then, through, his, usual, god, given, keenness, of, mind, invented, an, alphabet, which, he, through, the, grace, of, christ, successfully, organized, and, put, in, order, a, caucasian, albanian, alphabet, of, fifty, two, letters, bearing, resemblance, to, georgian, ethiopian, and, armenian, characters, survived, through, a, few, inscriptions, and, an, armenian, manuscript, dating, from, the, 15th, century, this, manuscript, matenadaran, no, 7117, first, published, by, ilia, abuladze, in, 1937, is, a, language, manual,

10th, century, iranian, contact, in, the, region, goes, back, to, the, median, and, achaemenid, times, during, this, arsacid, dynasty, of, caucasian, albania, the, parthian, language, spread, in, the, region, it, is, possible, that, the, language, and, literature, for, administration, and, record, keeping, of, the, imperial, chancellery, for, external, affairs, naturally, became, parthian, based, on, the, aramaic, alphabet, according, to, toumanoff, the, predominance, of, hellenism, as, under, the, artaxiads, was, now, followed, by, a, predominance, of, iranianism, and, symptomatically, instead, of, greek, as, before, parthian, became, the, language, of, the, educated, with, the, establishment, of, the, sassanids, middle, persian, a, closely, related, language, to, parthian, became, an, official, language, of, the, sassanid, empire, at, this, time, persian, enjoyed, even, more, success, than, the, caucasian, albanian, language, and, the, region, was, greatly, affected, by, iran, according, to, vladimir, minorsky, the, presence, of, iranian, settlers, in, transcaucasia, and, especially, in, the, proximity, of, the, passes, must, have, played, an, important, role, in, absorbing, and, pushing, back, the, aboriginal, inhabitants, such, names, as, sharvan, layzan, baylaqan, etc, suggest, that, the, iranian, immigration, proceeded, chiefly, from, gilan, and, other, regions, on, the, southern, coast, of, the, caspian, the, presence, of, the, persian, language, and, iranian, culture, continued, during, the, islamic, era, the, original, population, of, the,

the, late, 4th, century, in, the, sassanid, era, the, arab, conquest, and, the, chalcedonian, crisis, led, to, severe, disintegration, of, the, church, of, caucasian, albania, starting, from, the, 8th, century, much, of, the, local, population, converted, to, islam, by, the, 11th, century, there, already, were, conciliar, mosques, in, partaw, qabala, and, shaki, the, cities, that, were, the, creed, of, caucasian, albanian, christianity, these, islamised, groups, would, later, be, known, as, lezgins, and, tsakhurs, or, mix, with, the, turkic, and, iranian, population, to, form, present, day, azeris, whereas, those, that, remained, christian, were, gradually, absorbed, by, armenians, or, continued, to, exist, on, their, own, and, be, known, as, the, udi, people, the, caucasian, albanian, tribes, of, hereti, were, converted, to, eastern, orthodoxy, by, dinar, queen, of, hereti, in, the, 10th, century, the, religious, affairs, of, this, small, principality, were, now, officially, administered, by, the, georgian, orthodox, church, in, 1010, hereti, became, absorbed, into, the, neighbouring, georgian, kingdom, of, kakheti, eventually, in, the, early, 12th, century, these, lands, became, part, of, the, georgian, kingdom, under, david, the, builder, finalising, the, process, of, their, georgianisation, the, history, of, albania, before, the, 6th, century, bc, is, unknown, according, to, one, hypothesis, caucasian, albania, was, incorporated, in, the, median, empire, as, early, as, the, 7th, or, 6th, century, bc, however, an, increasing, persian, influence, on, the, region, is, usually, believed, to, be, connected, with, the, defence, of, persia, s, northern, frontiers, from, invading, nomads, as, early, as, the, achaemenid, empire, measures, may, have, been, taken, to, fortify, the, caucasian, passes, by, the, mid, 6th, century, bc, albania, has, been, incorporated, in, the, achaemenid, empire, it, was, later, controlled, by, the, achaemenid, satrapy, of, media, the, building, of, fortifications, and, gates, in, and, around, darband, is, traditionally, ascribed, to, the, sassanid, empire, the, greek, historian, arrian, mentions, perhaps, anachronistically, the, caucasian, albanians, for, the, first, time, in, the, battle, of, gaugamela, where, the, albanians, medes, cadussi, and, sacae, were, under, the, command, of, atropates,

of, various, autochthonous, people, ancient, chronicles, provide, the, names, of, several, peoples, that, populated, these, districts, including, the, regions, of, artsakh, and, utik, these, were, utians, mycians, caspians, gargarians, sakasenians, gelians, sodians, lupenians, balas, anians, parsians, and, parrasians, according, to, robert, h, hewsen, these, tribes, were, certainly, not, of, armenian, origin, and, although, certain, iranian, peoples, must, have, settled, here, during, the, long, period, of, persian, and, median, rule, most, of, the, natives, were, not, even, indo, europeans, he, also, states, that, the, several, peoples, of, the, right, bank, of, kura, were, highly, armenicized, and, that, many, were, actually, armenians, per, se, cannot, be, doubted, many, of, those, people, were, still, being, cited, as, distinct, ethnic, entities, when, the, right, bank, of, kura, was, acquired, by, the, caucasian, albanians, in, 387, ad, there, was, an, enduring,

albanians, were, led, by, a, brother, of, the, king, named, cosis, who, as, soon, as, the, fighting, was, at, close, quarters, rushed, upon, pompey, himself, and, smote, him, with, a, javelin, on, the, fold, of, his, breastplate, but, pompey, ran, him, through, the, body, and, killed, him, plutarch, also, reported, that, after, the, battle, pompey, set, out, to, march, to, the, caspian, sea,

sassanid, persia, the, religious, center, of, the, albanian, state, also, moved, here, however, king, vache, of, albania, a, relative, of, yazdegerd, ii, was, forced, to, convert, to, zoroastrianism, but, soon, thereafter, converted, back, to, christianity, according, to, the, history, of, the, country, of, albania, peroz, ordered, the, albanian, king, vache, ii, to, have, the, city, of, perozapat, the, city, of, peroz, or, prosperous, peroz, constructed, however, this, is, unlikely, as, the, kingdom, of, caucasian, albania, had, been, abolished, by, peroz, after, suppressing, a, revolt, by, vache, ii, in, the, mid, 460s, the, city, was, seemingly, founded, by, peroz, himself, after, the, removal, of, the, ruling, family, in, caucasian, albania, due, to, its, more, secure, location, it, was, made, the, new, residence, of, the, iranian, marzbans, albania, remained, kingless, until, 485, when, vachagan, iii, r, 485, 510, was, installed, on, the, throne, by, peroz, s, brother, and, successor, balash, r, 484, 488, in, 552, the, seat, of, the, albanian, catholicos, was, also, transferred, to, partaw, by, the, end, of, the, 5th, century, the, ancient, arsacid, royal, house, of, albania, a, branch, of, the, ruling, dynasty, of, parthia, became, extinct, and, in, the, 6th, century, it, was, replaced, by, princes, of, the, persian, or, parthian, mihranid, family, who, claimed, descent, from, the, sassanids, they, assumed, the, persian, title, of, arranshah, i, e, the, shah, of, arran, the, persian, name, of, albania, the, ruling, dynasty, was, named, after, its, persian, founder, mihran, who, was, a, distant, relative, of, the, sasanians, the, mihranid, dynasty, survived, under, muslim, suzerainty, until, 821, 22, in, the, late, 6th, to, early, 7th, centuries, the, territory, of, albania, became, an, arena, of, wars, between, sassanid, persia, byzantium, and, the, khazar, khanate, the, latter, two, very, often, acting, as, allies, against, sassanid, persia, in, 628, during, the, third, perso, turkic, war, the, khazars, invaded, albania, and, their, leader, ziebel, declared, himself, lord, of, albania, levying, a, tax, on, merchants, and, the, fishermen, of, the, kura, and, araxes, rivers, in, accordance, with, the, land, survey, of, the, kingdom, of, persia, most, of, transcaucasia, was, under, khazar, rule, before, the, arrival, of, the, arabs, however, some, other, sources, state, that, the, khazars, later, left, the, region, because, of, political, instability, according, to, peter, golden, steady, pressure, from, turkic, nomads, was, typical, of, the, khazar, era, although, there, are, no, unambiguous, references, to, permanent, settlements, while, vladimir, minorsky, stated, that, in, islamic, times, the, town, of, qabala, lying, between, shirvan, and, shakki, was, a, place, where, khazars, were, probably, settled, armenian, politics, culture, and, civilization, played, a, critical, role, in, the, entire, history, of, caucasian, albania, aghvank, in, armenian, this, due, to, the, fact, that, after, the, partition, of, the, kingdom, of, armenia, by, persia, and, byzantium, in, 387, ad, the, armenian, provinces, of, artsakh, and, utik, were, disassociated, from, the, armenian, kingdom, and, included, by, persians, into, a, single, province, marzpanate, called, aghvank, arran, this, new, unit, included, the, original, caucasian, albania, found, between, the, river, kura, and, the, great, caucasus, tribes, living, along, the, caspian, shore, as, well, as, artsakh, and, utik, two, territories, now, detached, from, armenia, the, armenian, medieval, atlas, ashkharhatsuyts, compiled, in, the, 7th, century, by, anania, shirakatsi, but, sometimes, attributed, to, movses, khorenatsi, as, well, categorizes, artsakh, and, utik, as, provinces, of, armenia, despite, their, presumed, detachment, from, the, armenian, kingdom, and, their, political, association, with, caucasian, albania, and, persia, at, the, time, of, his, writing, shirakatsi, specifies, that, artsakh, and, utik, are, now, detached, from, armenia, and, included, in, aghvank, and, he, takes, care, to, distinguish, this, new, entity, from, the, old, aghvank, strictly, speaking, situated, north, of, the, river, kura, because, it, was, more, homogeneous, and, more, developed, than, the, original, tribes, to, the, north, of, the, kura, the, armenian, element, took, over, caucasian, albania, s, political, life, and, was, progressively, able, to, impose, its, language, and, culture, the, armenian, population, of, artsakh, and, utik, remained, in, place, as, did, the, entire, political, social, cultural, and, military, structure, of, the, provinces, in, the, 5th, century, early, medieval, historian, khorenatsi, testifies, that, the, population, of, artsakh, and, utik, spoke, armenian, with, the, river, kura, in, his, words, marking, the, boundary, of, armenian, speech, though, this, does, not, mean, that, its, population, consisted, exclusively, of, ethnic, armenians, whatever, little, is, known, about, caucasian, albania, after, 387, ad, comes, from, the, old, armenian, text, history, of, the, land, of, aghvank, by, the, armenian, author, movses, kaghankatvatsi, also, known, as, movses, daskhurantsi, which, in, essence, is, the, history, of, armenia, s, provinces, of, artsakh, and, utik, kaghankatvatsi, repeating, khorenatsi, mentions, that, the, very, name, aghvank, albania, is, of, armenian, origin, and, relates, it, to, the, armenian, word, aghu, meaning, kind, benevolent, khorenatsi, states, that, aghu, was, a, nickname, given, to, prince, arran, whom, the, armenian, king, vologases, i, vagharsh, i, appointed, as, governor, of, northeastern, provinces, bordering, on, armenia, according, to, a, legend, reported, by, khorenatsi, arran, was, a, descendant, of, sisak, the, ancestor, of, the, siunids, of, armenia, s, province, of, syunik, and, thus, a, great, grandson, of, the, ancestral, eponym, of, the, armenians, the, forefather, hayk, kaghankatvatsi, and, another, armenian, author, kirakos, gandzaketsi, confirm, arran, s, belonging, to, hayk, s, bloodline, by,

armenian, caucasian, albania, one, of, the, consequences, of, this, was, that, the, armenian, language, progressively, supplanted, albanian, as, the, language, of, church, and, state, and, only, if, there, was, any, single, albanian, language, in, the, first, place, which, is, doubtful, because, the, population, of, albania, aghvank, was, described, as, consisting, of, as, many, 26, different,

hulagu, empire, in, the, 13th, century, later, it, became, a, part, of, chobanid, jalayirid, timurid, and, safavid, states, the, history, of, caucasian, albania, has, been, a, major, topic, of, azerbaijani, revisionist, theories, which, came, under, criticism, in, western, and, russian, academic, and, analytical, circles, and, were, often, characterized, as, bizarre, and, futile, in, his, article, the, albanian, myth, russian, historian, and, anthropologist, victor, schnirelmann, states, that, azerbaijani, academics, have, been, renaming, prominent, medieval, armenian, political, leaders, historians, and, writers, who, lived, in, nagorno, karabakh, and, armenia, into, albanians, schnirelmann, argues, that, these, efforts, were, first, launched, in, the, 1950s, and, were, directed, towards, ripping, the, population, of, early, medieval, nagorno, karabakh, off, from, their, armenian, heritage, and, cleansing, azerbaijan, of, armenian, history, in, the, 1970s, azerbaijan, made, a, transition, from, ignoring, discounting, or, concealing, armenian, historical, heritage, in, soviet, azerbaijan, to, misattributing, and, mischaracterizing, it, as, examples, of, azerbaijani, culture, by, arbitrarily, declaring, caucasian, albanians, as, ancestors, of, modern, azerbaijanis, in, this, regard, thomas, de, waal, a, scholar, at, the, carnegie, endowment, for, international, peace, writes, about, the, political, context, of, azerbaijan, s, historical, revisionism, this, rather, bizarre, argument, has, the, strong, political, subtext, that, nagorno, karabakh, had, in, fact, been, caucasian, albanian, and, that, armenians, had, no, claim, to, it, schnirelmann, states, that, a, significant, revisionist, method, used, by, azerbaijani, scholars, was, re, publishing, of, ancient, and, medieval, sources, where, the, term, armenian, state, was, routinely, and, systematically, removed, and, replaced, with, albanian, state, american, author, george, bournoutian, gives, examples, of, how, that, was, done, by, ziya, bunyadov, vice, chairman, of, azerbaijani, academy, of, sciences, who, earned, the, nickname, of, azerbaijan, s, foremost, armenophobe, according, to, de, waal, buniatov, s, scholarly, credentials, were, dubious, it, later, transpired, that, the, two, articles, he, published, in, 1960, and, 1965, on, caucasian, albania, were, direct, plagiarism, under, his, own, name, he, had, simply, published, unattributed, translations, of, two, articles, originally, written, in, english, by, western, scholars, c, f, j, dowsett, and, robert, hewsen, hewsen, a, historian, from, rowan, college, and, the, acknowledged, authority, in, this, field, wrote, in, his, volume, armenia, a, historical, atlas, published, by, university, of, chicago, press, scholars, should, be, on, guard, when, using, soviet, and, post, soviet, azeri, editions, of, azeri, persian, and, even, russian, and, western, european, sources, printed, in, baku, these, have, been, edited, to, remove, references, to, armenians, and, have, been, distributed, in, large, numbers, in, recent, years, when, utilizing, such, sources, the, researchers, should, seek, out, pre, soviet, editions, wherever, possible, according, to, de, waal, a, disciple, of, bunyadov, farida, mammadova, has, taken, the, albanian, theory, and, used, it, to, push, armenians, out, of, the, caucasus, altogether, she, had, relocated, caucasian, albania, into, what, is, now, the, republic, of, armenia, all, those, lands, churches, and, monasteries, in, the, republic, of, armenia, all, had, been, albanian, no, sacred, armenian, fact, was, left, un, attacked, de, waal, describes, mammadova, as, a, sophisticated, end, of, what, in, azerbaijan, has, become, a, very, blunt, instrument, indeed, both, ziya, bunyadov, and, farida, mammadova, are, known, for, their, anti, armenian, public, pronouncements, and, pamphlets, historical, revisionism, in, azerbaijan, supported, a, number, of, policies, on, the, ground, including, cultural, vandalism, directed, against, armenian, monuments, in, soviet, and, post, soviet, azerbaijan, armenian, memorial, stone, crosses, known, as, khachkars, on, the, territory, of, azerbaijan, were, regularly, misrepresented, as, caucasian, albanian, both, before, and, after, azerbaijan, s, independence, furthermore, mischaracterization, of, armenian, khachkars, as, supposedly, non, armenian, monuments, of, caucasian, albania, was, associated, with, acts, of, cultural, vandalism, against, armenian, historical, monuments, in, nakhichevan, the, khachkar, destruction, in, nakhchivan, refer, to, the, systematic, campaign, by, the, government, of, azerbaijan, to, completely, demolish, the, armenian, cemetery, in, julfa, with, thousands, of, armenian, khachkars, near, the, town, of, julfa, known, as, jugha, in, armenian, nakhchivan, claims, by, armenians, that, azerbaijan, was, undertaking, a, systematic, campaign, to, destroy, and, remove, the, monuments, first, arose, in, late, 1998, and, those, charges, were, renewed, in, 2002, and, 2005, adam, t, smith, an, anthropologist, and, associate, professor, of, anthropology, at, the, university, of, chicago, called, the, removal, of, the, khachkars, a, shameful, episode, in, humanity, s, relation, to, its, past, a, deplorable, act, on, the, part, of, the, government, of, azerbaijan, which, requires, both, explanation, and, repair, smith, and, other, scholars, as, well, as, several, united, states, senators, signed, a, letter, to, the, unesco, and, other, organizations, condemning, azerbaijan, s, government, azerbaijan, instead, contends, that, the, monuments, were, not, of, armenian, but, of, caucasian, albanian, origin, which, per, thomas, de, waal, did, not, protect, the, graveyard, from, an, act, in, the, history, wars, anti, armenian, cultural, vandalism, in, azerbaijan, perpetrated, with, the, use, of, revisionist, theories, on, caucasian, albania, was, also, noted, in, northern, azerbaijan, where, norwegian, archeologists, were, involved, in, the, restoration, of, an, armenian, georgian, church, in, the, village, of, kish, near, the, city, of, shaki, azerbaijanis, erased, armenian, inscriptions, on, the, church, s, walls, which, led, to, by, an, official, complaint, by, norwegian, foreign, ministry, furthermore, revisionist, theories, about, caucasian, albania, have, also, been, used, by, azerbaijani, statesmen, in, the, ongoing, azerbaijani, georgian, dispute, over, the, territorial, status, of, david, gareja, monastery, complex, a, georgian, spiritual, and, historical, monument, partially, located, on, the, territory, of, azerbaijani, republic, david, gareja, is, a, rock, hewn, georgian, orthodox, monastery, complex, in, the, kakheti, region, of, eastern, georgia, on, the, semi, desert, slopes, of, mount, gareja, some, 60, 70, km, southeast, of, georgia, s, capital, tbilisi, giorgi, manjgaladze, georgia, s, deputy, foreign, minister, proposed, that, georgia, would, be, willing, to, exchange, other, territory, for, the, remainder, of, david, gareja, because, of, its, historical, and, cultural, significance, to, the, georgians, baku, disapproves, of, this, land, swap, and, in, april, 2007, azerbaijan, s, deputy, foreign, minister, khalaf, khalafov, told, a, press, conference, in, baku, that, it, was, out, of, the, question, for, azerbaijan, to, give, up, its, claims, to, the, borderlands, including, david, gareja, khalafov, then, stated, that, the, monastery, was, home, to, the, caucasian, albanians, who, are, believed, to, have, been, the, earliest, inhabitants, of, azerbaijan, georgian, art, historian, dimitri, tumanishvili, dismissed, this, claim, and, stated, that, the, complex, is, covered, in, the, work, of, georgian, masters, there, are, georgian, inscriptions, everywhere, dating, back, to, the, sixth, century, he, said, there, are, no, traces, of, another, culture, there, after, that, i, don, t, think, you, need, any, further, proof
