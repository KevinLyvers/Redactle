some, of, the, same, issues, it, began, when, congolese, president, laurent, d, sir, kabila, turned, against, his, rwandan, and, ugandan, allies, who, had, helped, him, come, to, power, eventually, involving, belligerents, from, across, the, african, continent, the, war, officially, ended, on, 18, july, 2003, when, the, transitional, government, of, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, took, power, although, a, peace, agreement, was, signed, in, 2002, violence, has, continued, in, many, regions, of, the, country, especially, in, the, east, hostilities, have, continued, since, in, the, ongoing, lord, s, resistance, army, insurgency, and, the, kivu, and, ituri, conflicts, nine, african, countries, and, around, twenty, five, armed, groups, became, involved, in, the, war, in, 2008, the, international, rescue, committee, estimated, that, the, war, and, its, aftermath, had, caused, 5, 4, million, deaths, principally, through, disease, and, malnutrition, making, the, second, congo, war, the, deadliest, conflict, worldwide, since, world, war, ii, though, this, number, has, come, under, scrutiny, with, some, researchers, saying, that, many, of, the, deaths, would, have, occurred, without, the, conflict, another, 2, million, were, displaced, from, their, homes, or, sought, asylum, in, neighboring, countries, conflict, minerals, were, a, major, source, of, funding, for, the, war, and, for, subsequent, fighting, the, first, congo, war, began, in, 1996, as, rwanda, increasingly, expressed, concern, that, hutu, members, of, rassemblement, d, mocratique, pour, le, rwanda, rdr, militias, were, carrying, out, cross, border, raids, from, what, was, then, zaire, and, planning, an, invasion, of, rwanda, the, militias, mostly, hutu, had, entrenched, themselves, in, refugee, camps, in, eastern, zaire, where, many, had, fled, to, escape, the, tutsi, dominated, rwandan, patriotic, front, rpf, in, the, aftermath, of, the, rwandan, genocide, of, 1994, the, tutsi, dominated, rpf, government, of, rwanda, which, had, gained, power, in, july, 1994, protested, this, violation, of, rwandan, territorial, integrity, and, began, to, arm, the, ethnically, tutsi, banyamulenge, of, eastern, zaire, the, mobutu, regime, of, zaire, vigorously, denounced, this, intervention, but, possessed, neither, the, military, capability, to, halt, it, nor, the, political, capital, to, attract, international, assistance, with, active, support, from, uganda, rwanda, and, angola, the, tutsi, forces, of, laurent, d, sir, kabila, moved, methodically, down, the, congo, river, encountering, only, light, resistance, from, the, poorly, trained, ill, disciplined, forces, of, mobutu, s, crumbling, regime, the, bulk, of, kabila, s, fighters, were, tutsis, and, many, were, veterans, of, various, conflicts, in, the, great, lakes, region, of, africa, kabila, himself, had, credibility, as, a, long, time, political, opponent, of, mobutu, and, had, been, a, follower, of, patrice, lumumba, the, first, prime, minister, of, the, independent, congo, who, was, executed, by, a, combination, of, internal, and, external, forces, in, january, 1961, and, was, ultimately, replaced, by, mobutu, in, 1965, kabila, had, declared, himself, a, marxist, and, an, admirer, of, mao, zedong, he, had, been, waging, armed, rebellion, in, eastern, zaire, for, more, than, three, decades, though, che, guevara, in, his, account, of, the, early, years, of, the, conflict, portrayed, him, as, an, uncommitted, and, uninspiring, leader, kabila, s, army, began, a, slow, movement, west, in, december, 1996, near, the, end, of, the, great, lakes, refugee, crisis, taking, control, of, border, towns, and, mines, and, solidifying, control, there, were, reports, of, massacres, and, of, brutal, repression, by, the, rebel, army, a, un, human, rights, investigator, published, statements, from, witnesses, claiming, that, kabila, s, alliance, of, democratic, forces, for, the, liberation, of, congo, adflc, had, committed, massacres, and, that, the, advancing, army, had, killed, as, many, as, 60, 000, civilians, a, claim, the, adflc, strenuously, denied, roberto, garreton, stated, that, his, investigation, in, the, town, of, goma, turned, up, allegations, of, disappearances, torture, and, killings, he, quoted, mo, se, nyarugabo, an, aide, to, mobutu, as, saying, that, killings, and, disappearances, should, be, expected, in, wartime, kabila, s, forces, with, support, of, rwanda, launched, an, offensive, in, earlier, october, 1996, in, south, kivu, and, demanded, that, the, kinshasa, government, surrender, the, rebels, took, kasenga, on, 27, march, 1997, the, government, denied, the, rebels, success, starting, a, long, pattern, of, false, statements, from, the, defense, minister, on, the, progress, and, conduct, of, the, war, negotiations, were, proposed, in, late, march, and, on, 2, april, a, new, prime, minister, of, zaire, tienne, tshisekedi, a, longtime, rival, of, mobutu, was, installed, kabila, by, this, point, in, control, of, roughly, one, quarter, of, the, country, dismissed, this, as, irrelevant, and, warned, tshisekedi, that, he, would, have, no, part, in, a, new, government, if, he, accepted, the, post, the, adflc, made, consistent, progress, in, its, advance, from, the, east, throughout, april, 1997, and, by, may, its, troops, had, reached, the, outskirts, of, kinshasa, mobutu, fled, kinshasa, on, 16, may, and, the, lib, rateurs, liberators, entered, the, capital, without, serious, resistance, mobutu, fled, the, country, and, died, in, exile, in, morocco, four, months, later, kabila, proclaimed, himself, president, on, 17, may, 1997, he, immediately, ordered, a, violent, crackdown, to, restore, order, and, began, an, attempt, at, reorganisation, of, the, nation, when, kabila, gained, control, of, the, capital, in, may, 1997, he, faced, substantial, obstacles, to, governing, the, country, which, he, renamed, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, drc, from, za, re, beyond, political, jostling, among, various, groups, to, gain, power, and, an, enormous, external, debt, his, foreign, backers, proved, unwilling, to, leave, when, asked, the, conspicuous, rwandan, presence, in, the, capital, rankled, many, congolese, who, began, to, see, kabila, as, a, pawn, of, foreign, powers, tensions, reached, new, heights, on, 14, july, 1998, when, kabila, dismissed, his, rwandan, chief, of, staff, james, kabarebe, and, replaced, him, with, a, native, congolese, c, lestin, kifwa, although, the, move, chilled, what, was, already, a, troubled, relationship, with, rwanda, kabila, softened, the, blow, by, making, kabarebe, the, military, adviser, to, his, successor, two, weeks, later, kabila, chose, to, abandon, his, previous, decision, he, thanked, rwanda, for, its, help, and, ordered, all, rwandan, and, ugandan, military, forces, to, leave, the, country, within, 24, hours, rwandan, military, advisers, living, in, kinshasa, were, unceremoniously, flown, out, the, people, most, alarmed, by, this, order, were, the, banyamulenge, tutsi, of, eastern, congo, their, tensions, with, neighboring, ethnic, groups, had, been, a, contributing, factor, in, the, genesis, of, the, first, congo, war, and, they, were, also, used, by, rwanda, to, affect, events, across, the, border, in, the, drc, on, 2, august, 1998, the, banyamulenge, in, goma, erupted, into, rebellion, rwanda, offered, them, immediate, assistance, and, early, in, august, a, well, armed, rebel, group, the, rally, for, congolese, democracy, rcd, composed, primarily, of, banyamulenge, and, backed, by, rwanda, and, uganda, emerged, this, group, quickly, came, to, dominate, the, resource, rich, eastern, provinces, and, based, its, operations, in, goma, the, rcd, quickly, took, control, of, the, towns, of, bukavu, and, uvira, in, the, kivus, the, tutsi, led, rwandan, government, allied, with, uganda, and, burundi, also, retaliated, occupying, a, portion, of, northeastern, congo, to, help, remove, the, occupying, rwandans, president, kabila, enlisted, the, aid, of, refugee, hutus, in, eastern, congo, and, began, to, agitate, public, opinion, against, the, tutsis, resulting, in, several, public, lynchings, in, the, streets, of, kinshasa, on, 12, august, a, loyalist, army, major, broadcast, a, message, urging, resistance, from, a, radio, station, in, bunia, in, eastern, congo, people, must, bring, a, machete, a, spear, an, arrow, a, hoe, spades, rakes, nails, truncheons, electric, irons, barbed, wire, stones, and, the, like, in, order, dear, listeners, to, kill, the, rwandan, tutsis, the, rwandan, government, also, challenged, current, borders, by, claiming, a, substantial, part, of, eastern, congo, as, historically, rwandan, the, rwandans, alleged, that, kabila, was, organising, a, genocide, against, their, tutsi, brethren, in, the, kivu, region, the, degree, to, which, rwandan, intervention, was, motivated, by, a, desire, to, protect, the, banyamulenge, as, opposed, to, using, them, as, a, smokescreen, for, its, regional, aspirations, after, ousting, mobutu, is, still, being, debated, in, a, bold, move, rwandan, soldiers, under, the, command, of, james, kabarebe, hijacked, three, planes, and, flew, them, to, the, government, base, of, kitona, on, the, atlantic, coast, the, planes, landed, in, the, middle, of, the, kitona, base, but, the, motley, collection, of, troops, there, ex, faz, but, also, angolan, unita, elements, and, former, pascal, lissouba, militiamen, from, brazzaville, were, in, poor, condition, and, in, no, condition, to, fight, unless, given, food, and, weapons, they, were, quickly, won, over, to, the, rwandan, side, more, towns, in, the, east, and, around, kitona, fell, in, rapid, succession, as, the, combined, rcd, rwandan, and, rebel, soldiers, overwhelmed, government, forces, amid, a, flurry, of, ineffectual, diplomatic, efforts, by, various, african, nations, by, 13, august, less, than, two, weeks, after, the, revolt, had, begun, rebels, held, the, inga, hydroelectric, station, that, provided, power, to, kinshasa, as, well, as, the, port, of, matadi, through, which, most, of, kinshasa, s, food, passed, the, diamond, center, of, kisangani, fell, into, rebel, hands, on, 23, august, and, forces, advancing, from, the, east, had, begun, to, threaten, kinshasa, by, late, august, uganda, while, retaining, joint, support, of, the, rcd, with, rwanda, also, created, a, rebel, group, that, it, supported, exclusively, the, movement, for, the, liberation, of, congo, mlc, despite, the, movement, of, the, front, lines, fighting, continued, throughout, the, country, even, as, rebel, forces, advanced, on, kinshasa, government, forces, continued, to, battle, for, control, of, towns, in, the, east, of, the, country, the, hutu, militants, with, whom, kabila, was, co, operating, were, also, a, significant, force, in, the, east, nevertheless, the, fall, of, the, capital, and, of, kabila, who, had, spent, the, previous, weeks, desperately, seeking, support, from, various, african, nations, and, cuba, seemed, increasingly, certain, the, rebel, offensive, was, abruptly, reversed, as, kabila, s, diplomatic, efforts, bore, fruit, the, first, african, countries, to, respond, to, kabila, s, request, for, help, were, fellow, members, of, the, southern, african, development, community, sadc, while, officially, the, sadc, members, are, bound, to, a, mutual, defence, treaty, in, the, case, of, outside, aggression, many, member, nations, took, a, neutral, stance, to, the, conflict, however, the, governments, of, namibia, zimbabwe, and, angola, supported, the, kabila, government, after, a, meeting, in, harare, zimbabwe, on, 19, august, several, more, nations, joined, the, conflict, for, kabila, in, the, following, weeks, chad, libya, and, sudan, a, multisided, war, thus, began, in, september, 1998, zimbabwean, forces, flown, into, kinshasa, held, off, a, rebel, advance, that, reached, the, outskirts, of, the, capital, while, angolan, units, attacked, northward, from, its, borders, and, eastward, from, the, angolan, territory, of, cabinda, against, the, besieging, rebel, forces, this, intervention, by, various, nations, saved, the, kabila, government, and, pushed, the, rebel, front, lines, away, from, the, capital, however, it, was, unable, to, defeat, the, rebel, forces, and, the, advance, threatened, to, escalate, into, direct, conflict, with, the, national, armies, of, uganda, and, rwanda, in, november, 1998, a, new, ugandan, backed, rebel, group, the, movement, for, the, liberation, of, congo, was, reported, in, the, north, of, the, country, on, 6, november, rwandan, president, paul, kagame, admitted, for, the, first, time, that, rwandan, forces, were, assisting, the, rcd, rebels, for, security, reasons, apparently, after, a, request, by, nelson, mandela, to, advance, peace, talks, on, 18, january, 1999, rwanda, uganda, angola, namibia, and, zimbabwe, agreed, on, a, ceasefire, at, a, summit, at, windhoek, namibia, but, the, rcd, was, not, invited, fighting, thus, continued, outside, of, africa, most, states, remained, neutral, but, urged, an, end, to, the, violence, on, 5, april, 1999, tensions, within, the, rcd, about, the, dominance, of, the, banyamulenge, reached, a, boiling, point, when, rcd, leader, ernest, wamba, dia, wamba, moved, his, base, from, goma, to, uganda, controlled, kisangani, to, head, a, breakaway, faction, known, as, rcd, kisangani, which, later, became, the, forces, for, renewal, a, further, sign, of, a, break, occurred, when, president, yoweri, museveni, of, uganda, and, kabila, signed, a, ceasefire, accord, on, 18, april, in, sirte, libya, following, the, mediation, of, libyan, leader, muammar, al, gaddafi, but, both, the, rcd, and, rwanda, refused, to, take, part, on, 16, may, wamba, was, ousted, as, head, of, the, rcd, in, favour, of, a, pro, rwanda, figure, dr, emile, ilunga, seven, days, later, the, various, factions, of, the, rcd, clashed, over, control, of, kisangani, on, 8, june, rebel, factions, met, to, try, to, create, a, common, front, against, kabila, despite, these, efforts, the, occupying, armed, forces, of, uganda, recreated, the, province, of, ituri, based, off, of, the, province, of, kibali, ituri, which, previously, existed, from, 1962, to, 1966, in, the, republic, of, the, congo, perceived, favoritism, to, the, ethnic, hema, by, the, ugandan, forces, sparked, the, ethnic, clash, of, the, ituri, conflict, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, war, within, a, war, nevertheless, diplomatic, circumstances, contributed, to, the, first, ceasefire, of, the, war, in, july, 1999, the, lusaka, ceasefire, agreement, was, signed, by, the, six, warring, countries, democratic, republic, of, congo, angola, namibia, zimbabwe, rwanda, and, uganda, and, on, 1, august, the, mlc, the, rcd, refused, to, sign, until, 31, august, under, the, terms, of, the, agreement, forces, from, all, sides, under, a, joint, military, commission, would, co, operate, in, tracking, disarming, and, documenting, all, armed, groups, in, the, congo, especially, those, forces, identified, with, the, 1994, rwandan, genocide, few, provisions, however, were, made, to, actually, disarm, the, militias, the, united, nations, security, council, deployed, about, 90, liaison, personnel, in, august, 1999, to, support, the, ceasefire, however, in, the, following, months, all, sides, accused, the, others, of, repeatedly, breaking, the, cease, fire, and, it, became, clear, that, small, incidents, could, trigger, attacks, tensions, between, uganda, and, rwanda, escalated, as, units, of, the, uganda, people, s, defense, force, and, the, rwandan, patriotic, army, clashed, in, kisangani, on, the, morning, of, 7, august, fighting, broke, out, again, between, the, two, armies, on, the, evening, of, 14, august, fighting, occurred, throughout, much, of, kisangani, including, in, the, airport, and, on, major, roads, the, conflict, lasted, until, 17, august, when, a, ceasefire, was, called, that, day, both, sides, used, heavy, weapons, during, these, clashes, as, reported, by, the, international, crisis, group, the, fighting, was, a, result, of, differences, over, the, objectives, and, strategies, used, during, the, war, b, in, november, government, controlled, television, in, kinshasa, claimed, that, kabila, s, army, had, been, rebuilt, and, was, now, prepared, to, fulfil, its, mission, to, liberate, the, country, rwandan, supported, rebel, forces, launched, a, major, offensive, and, approached, kinshasa, but, were, eventually, repelled, by, 24, february, 2000, the, un, authorised, a, force, of, 5, 537, troops, the, united, nations, organization, mission, in, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, known, by, the, french, acronym, monuc, to, monitor, the, cease, fire, however, fighting, continued, between, rebels, and, government, forces, and, between, rwandan, and, ugandan, forces, numerous, clashes, and, offensives, occurred, throughout, the, country, most, notably, heavy, fighting, between, uganda, and, rwanda, in, kisangani, in, may, and, june, 2000, on, 9, august, 2000, a, government, offensive, in, equateur, province, along, the, ubangi, river, was, repulsed, near, libenge, by, mlc, forces, military, operations, and, diplomatic, efforts, made, by, the, un, african, union, and, southern, african, development, community, failed, to, make, any, headway, on, 16, january, 2001, laurent, d, sir, kabila, was, shot, and, killed, at, the, palais, de, marbre, in, kinshasa, the, government, initially, stated, that, kabila, was, wounded, but, still, alive, when, he, was, flown, to, zimbabwe, for, intensive, care, the, circumstances, of, his, assassination, are, unclear, and, have, been, the, subject, of, considerable, rumours, and, disagreements, the, consensus, is, that, kabila, was, shot, by, one, of, his, bodyguards, the, 18, year, old, rashidi, mizele, a, kadogo, child, soldier, mizele, had, previously, been, misidentified, as, rashidi, kasereka, two, days, later, the, government, announced, on, state, television, that, the, desperate, attempt, by, zimbabwean, medical, personnel, to, save, kabila, had, failed, and, that, kabila, had, died, from, his, injuries, his, remains, were, returned, for, a, state, funeral, on, 26, january, 2001, shortly, after, the, assassination, the, french, newspaper, le, monde, published, a, story, in, which, self, identified, assassination, plotters, revealed, documents, and, details, of, the, plot, to, murder, kabila, the, plotters, were, mainly, kadogos, who, had, been, under, kabila, s, command, since, 1996, and, were, aggrieved, over, their, poor, treatment, the, catalyst, for, the, assassination, appeared, to, be, the, execution, of, 47, kadogos, accused, of, plotting, against, kabila, the, execution, witnessed, by, kabila, took, place, the, day, before, his, assassination, while, the, role, of, the, disgruntled, kadogos, is, relatively, well, established, there, have, been, some, attempts, to, argue, that, they, were, under, the, influence, of, external, actors, who, sought, to, overthrow, kabila, some, congolese, officials, attempted, to, implicate, their, principal, enemies, by, alleging, that, the, rwandans, masterminded, the, operation, some, observers, have, lent, credibility, to, these, allegations, including, al, jazeera, s, documentary, murder, in, kinshasa, which, alleges, that, a, lebanese, diamond, dealer, allegedly, organised, the, logistics, of, the, organisation, others, have, speculated, that, the, angolans, due, to, kabila, s, complicity, in, helping, the, angolan, rebel, group, unita, channel, funds, through, the, drc, or, even, the, americans, were, involved, in, the, assassination, there, is, as, yet, no, proof, that, mizele, or, the, kadogos, were, acting, under, orders, from, an, external, source, by, unanimous, vote, of, the, congolese, parliament, his, son, joseph, kabila, was, sworn, in, as, president, to, replace, him, that, he, won, the, election, was, largely, due, to, robert, mugabe, s, backing, and, the, fact, that, most, parliamentarians, had, been, handpicked, by, the, elder, kabila, in, february, the, new, president, met, rwandan, president, paul, kagame, in, the, united, states, rwanda, uganda, and, the, rebels, agreed, to, a, un, pullout, plan, uganda, and, rwanda, began, pulling, troops, back, from, the, front, line, joseph, kabila, has, been, described, as, a, more, adept, political, leader, than, his, father, as, chris, talbot, notes, an, article, in, the, washington, post, favourably, contrasted, joseph, kabila, western, educated, and, english, speaking, with, his, father, the, author, of, the, washington, post, article, writes, that, joseph, kabila, gave, diplomats, hope, that, things, have, changed, in, contrast, to, laurent, d, sir, kabila, who, stood, as, the, major, impediment, to, a, peaceful, settlement, of, the, war, launched, in, august, 1998, to, unseat, him, a, peace, accord, laurent, signed, in, the, summer, of, 1999, the, lusaka, ceasefire, agreement, remained, unfulfilled, largely, because, he, kept, staging, new, offensives, while, blocking, deployment, of, u, n, peacekeepers, in, government, held, territory, to, compare, according, to, an, analyst, from, the, london, based, economist, intelligence, unit, the, only, obstruction, had, been, kabila, because, the, accord, called, for, the, government, s, democratic, transition, and, that, was, a, threat, to, his, power, in, april, 2001, a, un, panel, of, experts, investigated, the, illegal, exploitation, of, diamonds, cobalt, coltan, gold, and, other, lucrative, resources, in, the, congo, the, report, accused, rwanda, uganda, and, zimbabwe, of, systematically, exploiting, congolese, resources, and, recommended, the, security, council, impose, sanctions, in, 2002, rwanda, s, situation, in, the, war, began, to, worsen, many, members, of, the, rcd, either, gave, up, fighting, or, decided, to, join, kabila, s, government, moreover, the, banyamulenge, the, backbone, of, rwanda, s, militia, forces, became, increasingly, tired, of, control, from, kigali, and, the, unending, conflict, a, number, of, them, mutinied, leading, to, violent, clashes, between, them, and, rwandan, forces, at, the, same, time, the, western, congo, was, becoming, increasingly, secure, under, the, younger, kabila, international, aid, was, resumed, as, inflation, was, brought, under, control, in, march, the, rcd, goma, faction, captured, moliro, a, town, located, on, the, coast, of, lake, tanganyika, from, government, forces, according, to, said, faction, the, town, was, shelled, by, government, gunboats, the, following, day, in, response, the, capture, was, seen, as, a, violation, of, the, lusaka, ceasefire, agreement, under, the, leadership, of, south, africa, peace, talks, held, in, that, country, between, april, and, december, 2002, led, to, the, signing, of, a, comprehensive, peace, agreement, the, sun, city, agreement, was, formalised, on, 19, april, 2002, it, was, a, framework, for, providing, the, congo, with, a, unified, multiparty, government, and, democratic, elections, however, critics, noted, that, there, were, no, stipulations, regarding, the, unification, of, the, army, which, weakened, the, effectiveness, of, the, agreement, there, were, several, reported, breaches, of, the, sun, city, agreement, but, it, has, seen, a, reduction, in, the, fighting, on, 30, july, 2002, rwanda, and, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, signed, a, peace, deal, known, as, the, pretoria, accord, after, five, days, of, talks, in, pretoria, south, africa, the, talks, centered, on, two, issues, one, was, the, withdrawal, of, the, estimated, 20, 000, rwandan, soldiers, in, the, congo, the, other, was, the, rounding, up, of, the, ex, rwandan, soldiers, and, the, dismantling, of, the, hutu, militia, known, as, interahamwe, which, took, part, in, rwanda, s, 1994, genocide, and, continues, to, operate, out, of, eastern, congo, rwanda, had, previously, refused, to, withdraw, until, the, hutu, militias, were, dealt, with, signed, on, 6, september, the, luanda, agreement, formalised, peace, between, congo, and, uganda, the, treaty, aimed, to, get, uganda, to, withdraw, its, troops, from, bunia, and, to, improve, the, relationship, between, the, two, countries, but, implementation, proved,

the, departure, of, over, 20, 000, rwandan, soldiers, on, 21, october, the, un, published, its, expert, panel, s, report, on, the, pillage, of, natural, resources, by, armed, groups, both, rwanda, and, uganda, rejected, accusations, that, senior, political, and, military, figures, were, involved, in, illicit, trafficking, of, plundered, resources, zimbabwe, defense, minister, sydney, sekeramayi, says, the, zimbabwean, military, withdrew, from, the, drc, in, october, 2002, but, in, june, 2006, reporters, said, a, 50, man, force, had, stayed, in, the, drc, to, protect, kabila, on,

result, in, legislative, and, presidential, election, within, two, years, of, its, signing, and, marked, the, formal, end, of, the, second, congo, war, at, the, end, of, 2002, through, january, 2003, around, 60, 000, pygmy, civilians, and, 10, 000, combatants, were, killed, in, an, extermination, campaign, known, as, effacer, le, tableau, by, the, movement, for, the, liberation, of, congo, human, rights, activists, have, made, demands, for, the, massacre, to, be, recognized, as, a, genocide, on, 18, july, 2003, the, transitional, government, came, into, being, as, specified, in, the, global, and, all, inclusive, agreement, out, of, the, warring, parties, the, agreement, obliges, the, parties, to, carry, out, a, plan, to, reunify, the, country, disarm, and, integrate, the, warring, parties, and, hold, elections, there, were, numerous, problems, resulting, in, continued, instability, in, much, of, the, country, and, a, delay, in, the, scheduled, national, elections, from, june, 2005, to, july, 2006, the, main, cause, for, the, continued, weakness, of, the, transitional, government, is, the, refusal, by, the, former, warring, parties, to, give, up, power, to, a, centralised, and, neutral, national, administration, some, belligerents, maintained, administrative, and, military, command, and, control, structures, separate, from, that, of, the, transitional, government, but, as, the, international, crisis, group, has, reported, these, have, gradually, been, reduced, a, high, level, of, official, corruption, siphoning, money, away, from, civil, servants, soldiers, and, infrastructure, projects, causes, further, instability, on, 30, july, 2006, the, first, elections, were, held, in, the, drc, after, the, populace, approved, a, new, constitution, a, second, round, was, held, on, 30, october, robert, mugabe, s, administration, dispatched, elements, of, the, zimbabwe, national, army, to, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, in, 1998, mugabe, perhaps, the, most, ardent, supporter, of, intervention, on, kabila, s, behalf, was, the, only, major, player, involved, in, the, conflict, able, to, marshal, a, reasonably, modern, and, experienced, air, force, zimbabwe, s, military, was, also, regarded, as, being, one, of, the, more, well, equipped, and, professional, of, the, region, being, the, decisive, factor, in, the, outcome, of, the, war, and, exhibiting, outstanding, tactical, proficiency, zimbabwean, strategy, revolved, around, defending, the, person, of, laurent, kabila, only, with, allied, forces, as, congolese, forces, were, thought, to, be, unreliable, then, retake, important, settlements, and, expel, the, rebels, from, the, kinshasa, region, mugabe, s, initial, buildup, in, kinshasa, consisted, of, special, forces, along, with, some, paratroops, reportedly, numbering, between, 600, and, 1, 000, by, august, 1998, two, more, battalions, had, been, dispatched, they, were, accompanied, by, some, soviet, manufactured, t, 54, 55, tanks, crocodile, armoured, personnel, carriers, and, ee, 9, cascavel, scout, cars, flown, into, the, capital, on, angolan, air, force, planes, the, contingent, grew, to, 3, 800, around, november, and, peaked, at, 12, 000, in, january, 2001, the, zimbabweans, began, leaving, in, 2002, and, had, completely, withdrawn, by, the, end, of, the, year, prior, to, this, deployment, zimbabwe, had, built, up, an, apparently, potent, brigade, sized, combined, arms, reaction, force, with, efficient, air, support, and, professional, competence, however, the, prolonged, operations, in, the, congo, are, said, to, have, damaged, its, credibility, the, air, force, of, zimbabwe, made, particularly, effective, use, of, its, air, power, hitting, rebel, and, rwandan, offensives, on, mbuji, mayi, with, repeated, strikes, by, bae, hawks, and, hawker, hunters, it, also, sustained, heavy, losses, during, the, conflict, including, three, of, its, six, mil, mi, 24, hind, helicopters, a, transport, aircraft, and, an, unidentified, interceptor, probably, a, chinese, chengdu, j, 7, despite, the, effectiveness, of, its, highly, mobile, big, gunned, eland, 90, and, cascavel, armoured, cars, zimbabwean, ground, forces, also, lost, a, significant, number, either, captured, or, destroyed, by, the, rebel, coalition, under, the, direction, of, president, sam, nujoma, namibia, became, involved, in, the, congo, on, behalf, of, its, commitment, to, the, southern, african, development, community, nujoma, a, longtime, ally, of, kabila, claimed, he, could, not, refuse, the, requests, for, military, assistance, from, zimbabwe, and, angola, windhoek, s, ruling, swapo, party, had, interests, in, kinshasa, similar, to, those, claimed, by, mugabe, including, lucrative, fish, exports, and, a, valuable, stake, in, the, societ, mini, re, de, bakwanga, in, february, 1999, namibian, defence, force, personnel, in, the, congo, numbered, barely, 1, 000, likely, a, single, infantry, battalion, group, with, staff, artillery, logistics, support, and, a, flight, of, allouette, helicopters, and, y, 12, transport, aircraft, from, the, namibian, air, force, between, 2000, and, 2001, this, figure, may, have, fluctuated, between, 1, 600, and, 2, 000, though, namibian, troops, remained, of, little, importance, to, the, conflict, they, were, withdrawn, by, 2002, by, which, point, 30, servicemen, had, been, killed, in, action, and, the, war, effort, was, costing, namibia, 150, 000, a, day, the, namibian, intervention, was, greeted, with, intense, criticism, by, opposition, parties, as, well, as, neighboring, south, africa, and, several, western, donors, the, european, union, expressed, concern, that, nujoma, was, misusing, his, country, s, development, funds, for, the, congo, expedition, and, individual, member, states, including, finland, cut, off, financial, aid, a, furious, diplomatic, row, also, ensued, with, south, african, authorities, after, they, suspended, all, outgoing, military, exports, to, the, ndf, the, angolan, government, had, fought, against, mobutu, s, s, seko, in, the, first, congo, war, because, of, his, support, for, rebel, unita, in, the, angolan, civil, war, the, angolan, government, wanted, to, eliminate, unita, operations, in, southern, congo, which, exchanged, diamonds, extracted, from, rebel, held, angola, for, foreign, weapons, angola, had, no, confidence, that, a, new, president, would, be, more, effective, than, kabila, and, feared, that, continued, fighting, would, lead, to, a, power, vacuum, that, could, only, help, unita, the, intervention, of, the, experienced, angolan, forces, was, essential, in, deciding, the, outcome, of, both, wars, kabila, had, originally, discounted, the, possibility, of, support, from, fran, afrique, francophone, africa, but, after, a, summit, meeting, in, libreville, gabon, on, 24, september, chad, agreed, to, send, 2, 000, troops, france, had, encouraged, chad, to, join, as, a, means, of, regaining, influence, in, a, region, where, the, french, had, retreated, after, the, 1994, genocide, committed, against, tutsi, in, rwanda, nevertheless, chadian, intervention, resulted, in, a, fiasco, its, forces, were, accused, of, serious, human, rights, violations, and, looting, virtually, from, their, arrival, in, the, country, they, withdrew, very, quickly, under, international, and, national, pressure, and, opprobrium, unconfirmed, reports, in, september, 1999, indicated, that, forces, of, the, government, of, sudan, were, fighting, rebels, in, orientale, province, close, to, the, sudanese, and, ugandan, borders, however, sudan, did, not, establish, a, significant, military, presence, inside, the, drc, though, it, continued, to, offer, extensive, support, to, three, ugandan, rebel, groups, the, lord, s, resistance, army, the, uganda, national, rescue, front, ii, and, the, allied, democratic, forces, in, retaliation, for, ugandan, support, for, the, sudan, people, s, liberation, army, the, fragility, of, the, state, has, allowed, continued, violence, and, human, rights, abuses, in, the, east, there, are, three, significant, centres, of, conflict, the, ethnic, violence, between, hutu, and, tutsi, aligned, forces, has, been, a, driving, impetus, for, much, of, the, conflict, with, people, on, both, sides, fearing, their, annihilation, the, kinshasa, and, hutu, aligned, forces, enjoyed, close, relations, as, their, interests, in, expelling, the, armies, and, proxy, forces, of, uganda, and, rwanda, dovetail, while, the, uganda, and, rwanda, aligned, forces, worked, closely, together, to, gain, territory, at, the, expense, of, kinshasa, competition, over, access, to, resources, created, a, fissure, in, their, relationship, there, were, reports, that, uganda, permitted, kinshasa, to, send, arms, to, the, hutu, fdlr, via, territory, held, by, uganda, backed, rebels, as, uganda, kinshasa, and, the, hutus, are, all, seeking, in, varying, degrees, to, check, the, influence, of, rwanda, and, its, affiliates, rwanda, backed, rebels, due, to, fears, of, hutu, rebels, on, its, border, the, kinshasa, government, was, suspicious, of, kigali, s, influence, over, the, region, as, rwanda, has, occupied, the, area, numerous, times, and, some, witnesses, confirm, that, rwanda, has, profited, from, the, looting, of, congolese, minerals, consequently, rwanda, allegedly, supported, the, continuing, rebellion, of, general, nkunda, in, congo, nkunda, was, however, arrested, by, rwandan, police, in, 2009, the, drc, sought, assurance, that, kigali, aligned, forces, have, no, conflict, mineral, or, territorial, interests, in, eastern, congo, on, 19, december, 2005, the, united, nations, international, court, of, justice, ruled, that, the, drc, s, sovereignty, had, been, violated, by, uganda, and, that, drc, had, lost, billions, of, dollars, worth, of, resources, the, drc, government, has, asked, for, 10, billion, in, compensation, though, the, icj, has, taken, many, steps, to, ensure, that, war, crimes, and, crimes, against, humanity, will, be, prosecuted, the, international, monetary, fund, and, the, world, bank, rewarded, both, uganda, and, rwanda, with, debt, relief, packages, for, improving, their, economic, health, during, a, time, when, much, of, their, increased, revenue, was, partially, a, direct, result, of, illegally, importing, conflicted, minerals, from, the, drc, in, this, case, international, institutions, such, as, the, imf, and, wb, are, allegedly, at, odds, with, international, laws, and, charters, both, the, imf, and, wb, have, been, accused, of, helping, to, facilitate, the, conflict, in, the, drc, by, rewarding, combatants, the, deteriorated, infrastructure, and, constant, threat, of, attacks, made, overland, travel, impossible, causing, internal, trade, in, congo, to, come, to, a, standstill, on, the, congo, river, the, most, important, remaining, transport, route, there, was, no, ship, traffic, between, the, different, power, regions, for, years, isolated, villages, were, cut, off, from, urban, markets, while, cities, suffered, from, food, shortages, in, kinshasa, food, prices, quadrupled, within, a, year, international, aid, arrived, only, sparingly, initially, it, was, mainly, limited, to, kinshasa, and, it, was, not, until, 2001, that, it, reached, the, actual, war, zones, in, the, east, the, impoverishment, of, the, population, worsened, further, a, 2006, study, by, the, congolese, government, three, years, after, the, end, of, the, war, revealed, that, 76, of, the, population, could, not, send, their, children, to, school, 79, were, malnourished, 81, did, not, have, adequate, housing, and, 82, had, no, access, to, medical, care, overall, 71, of, the, population, lived, in, absolute, poverty, 85, in, the, poorest, province, of, quateur, according, to, aid, organizations, in, 2000, 31, of, kinshasa, s, residents, were, chronically, malnourished, and, only, 10, could, afford, three, meals, a, day, in, 2003, the, average, food, intake, of, the, population, was, 1300, kilocalories, per, day, the, health, system, was, largely, destroyed, and, reportedly, 500, 000, people, died, of, malaria, each, year, more, than, a, third, of, them, children, under, five, years, old, zimbabwean, involvement, in, the, war, had, a, significant, negative, impact, on, the, country, s, economy, as, hardware, losses, multiplied, western, donors, including, the, international, monetary, fund, and, the, world, bank, placed, their, aid, programmes, to, harare, under, review, denying, mugabe, the, foreign, currency, he, needed, to, buy, spare, parts, valued, at, 600, million, for, fighting, vehicles, then, employed, in, the, congo, between, january, to, june, 2000, the, financial, times, reported, via, a, leaked, memo, from, minister, of, finance, herbert, murerwa, that, zimbabwe, spent, 166, million, on, its, military, ventures, there, these, factors, contributed, to, the, country, s, severe, economic, instability, during, the, 2000s, culminating, in, a, period, of, hyperinflation, between, 2007, and, 2009, the, war, has, caused, substantial, environmental, damage, the, forests, of, congo, are, a, major, biodiversity, hotspot, housing, the, congo, basin, which, is, widely, known, as, the, second, greatest, tropical, rain, forest, in, the, world, and, the, largest, forest, in, africa, on, account, of, the, war, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, saw, their, elephant, population, halve, in, size, their, hippo, population, go, from, 22, 000, to, 900, and, their, great, ape, population, decrease, by, 77, 93, between, 1998, and, 2015, with, up, to, 3, 4, million, people, being, displaced, in, congo, as, a, result, of, the, civil, war, many, moved, into, congo, s, forests, where, they, hunted, bonobos, gorillas, elephants, and, more, as, bushmeat, for, survival, and, cleared, forest, land, that, were, significant, habitats, for, these, many, animals, many, of, these, individuals, were, either, from, the, city, where, the, hunting, of, certain, animals, was, not, a, taboo, or, locals, who, had, their, tradition, slowly, broken, down, because, of, their, need, to, survive, one, such, example, had, been, the, bongando, people, in, which, a, 2009, study, by, kyoto, university, had, observed, a, disintegration, of, their, cultural, interdiction, of, eating, bonobos, as, influenced, by, the, civil, war, during, the, conflict, many, of, the, front, lines, were, located, within, bonobos, reserves, further, contributing, to, the, decline, in, their, population, government, instability, and, the, lack, of, government, enforcement, allowed, new, illegal, militia, mining, camps, to, form, which, located, themselves, deep, within, congo, s, forest, there, bushmeat, became, the, main, source, of, food, on, top, of, that, the, mass, number, of, people, entering, the, forests, in, conjunction, with, the, mines, unsanitary, conditions, introduced, an, increased, risk, of, disease, for, animals, such, as, gorillas, the, government, instability, and, the, dangers, of, war, also, ceased, much, of, the, conservation, and, protection, efforts, occurring, in, congo, at, the, time, enabling, the, numerous, rampant, rebel, groups, present, in, congo, to, openly, partake, in, poaching, military, assistance, having, been, obstructed, by, surrounding, african, countries, congo, was, pushed, into, entering, numerous, lumber, leases, with, german, chinese, and, malaysian, corporations, to, uphold, their, military, activities, the, roads, emerging, to, support, the, new, logging, efforts, opened, nearby, villages, to, receive, easier, means, of, transportation, and, access, to, deeper, parts, of, congo, s, wildlife, reserves, the, result, was, a, significant, increase, in, bushmeat, sales, in, villages, near, these, logging, sites, the, potential, threat, of, rebel, forces, during, the, war, caused, many, military, officers, controlling, urban, trade, to, leave, their, post, this, created, an, open, access, market, in, the, bushmeat, and, pet, trade, that, was, then, undertaken, by, exploitative, lower, ranked, soldiers, looking, for, profit, the, result, was, an, observed, quintuple, increase, of, protected, animal, sales, in, urban, markets, in, north, eastern, parts, of, congo, around, garamba, national, park, meanwhile, in, other, northern, parts, of, congo, researchers, in, other, studies, have, found, a, 23, increase, in, protected, animal, sales, with, the, overall, pattern, being, a, significant, increase, in, protected, animal, sales, the, war, resulted, in, a, loss, of, 1, 31, of, congo, s, forests, a, size, comparable, to, belgium, the, millions, of, displaced, individuals, led, to, large, scale, logging, and, deforestation, to, create, arable, land, these, activities, had, an, outsized, effect, due, to, the, edge, effect, as, a, result, of, the, forest, fragmentation, the, virunga, national, park, africa, s, oldest, national, park, became, the, first, endangered, un, world, heritage, site, its, flora, was, cleared, during, both, the, first, and, second, congo, war, to, make, way, for, both, the, rwandan, and, congolese, army, the, human, security, report, project, hsrp, of, simon, fraser, university, has, challenged, the, toll, of, 5, 4, million, war, related, deaths, between, 1998, and, 2008, it, states, that, of, the, irc, s, five, periodic, estimates, two, that, cover, a, period, from, 1998, to, 2001, are, flawed, and, the, reported, 2, 6, million, deaths, therein, should, not, be, included, in, the, total, death, toll, the, other, three, periodic, irc, estimates, cover, a, period, from, may, 2001, april, 2007, and, in, which, 2, 83, million, of, the, total, 5, 4, million, deaths, were, reported, the, hsrp, argued, that, the, estimates, were, built, on, a, general, death, rate, that, was, far, too, low, for, congo, and, that, most, of, those, people, would, have, most, likely, died, anyway, thus, the, irc, figure, should, be, revised, to, 860, 000, total, war, related, excess, deaths, in, response, to, the, criticism, from, hsrp, one, of, the, authors, of, the, irc, report, argued, the, following, although, there, may, have, been, small, statistical, discrepancies, in, the, original, study, the, irc, report, had, been, widely, peer, reviewed, and, was, judged, to, be, an, accurate, estimate, of, the, war, related, excess, deaths, general
