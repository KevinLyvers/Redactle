the, middle, kingdom, of, egypt, also, known, as, the, period, of, reunification, is, the, period, in, the, history, of, ancient, egypt, following, a, period, of, political, division, known, as, the, first, intermediate, period, the, middle, kingdom, lasted, from, approximately, 2040, to, 1782, bc, stretching, from, the, reunification, of, egypt, under, the, reign, of, mentuhotep, ii, in, the, eleventh, dynasty, to, the, end, of, the, twelfth, dynasty, the, kings, of, the, eleventh, dynasty, ruled, from, thebes, and, the, kings, of, the, twelfth, dynasty, ruled, from, el, lisht, the, concept, of, the, middle, kingdom, as, one, of, three, golden, ages, was, coined, in, 1845, by, german, egyptologist, baron, von, bunsen, and, its, definition, evolved, significantly, throughout, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, some, scholars, also, include, the, thirteenth, dynasty, of, egypt, wholly, into, this, period, in, which, case, the, middle, kingdom, would, end, around, 1650, bc, while, others, only, include, it, until, merneferre, ay, around, 1700, bc, last, king, of, this, dynasty, to, be, attested, in, both, upper, and, lower, egypt, during, the, middle, kingdom, period, osiris, became, the, most, important, deity, in, popular, religion, the, middle, kingdom, was, followed, by, the, second, intermediate, period, of, egypt, another, period, of, division, that, involved, foreign, rule, of, lower, egypt, by, the, hyksos, of, west, asia, after, the, collapse, of, the, old, kingdom, egypt, entered, a, period, of, weak, pharaonic, power, and, decentralization, called, the, first, intermediate, period, towards, the, end, of, this, period, two, rival, dynasties, known, in, egyptology, as, the, tenth, and, eleventh, fought, for, control, of, the, entire, country, the, theban, eleventh, dynasty, only, ruled, southern, egypt, from, the, first, cataract, to, the, tenth, nome, of, upper, egypt, to, the, north, lower, egypt, was, ruled, by, the, rival, tenth, dynasty, from, herakleopolis, the, struggle, was, to, be, concluded, by, mentuhotep, ii, who, ascended, the, theban, throne, in, 2055, bc, during, mentuhotep, ii, s, fourteenth, regnal, year, he, took, advantage, of, a, revolt, in, the, thinite, nome, to, launch, an, attack, on, herakleopolis, which, met, little, resistance, after, toppling, the, last, rulers, of, the, tenth, dynasty, mentuhotep, began, consolidating, his, power, over, all, of, egypt, a, process, that, he, finished, by, his, 39th, regnal, year, for, this, reason, mentuhotep, ii, is, regarded, as, the, founder, of, the, middle, kingdom, mentuhotep, ii, commanded, petty, campaigns, as, far, south, as, the, second, cataract, in, nubia, which, had, gained, its, independence, during, the, first, intermediate, period, he, also, restored, egyptian, hegemony, over, the, sinai, region, which, had, been, lost, to, egypt, since, the, end, of, the, old, kingdom, to, consolidate, his, authority, he, restored, the, cult, of, the, ruler, depicting, himself, as, a, god, in, his, own, lifetime, wearing, the, headdresses, of, amun, and, min, he, died, after, a, reign, of, 51, years, and, passed, the, throne, to, his, son, mentuhotep, iii, mentuhotep, iii, reigned, for, only, twelve, years, during, which, he, continued, consolidating, theban, rule, over, the, whole, of, egypt, building, a, series, of, forts, in, the, eastern, delta, region, to, secure, egypt, against, threats, from, asia, he, also, sent, the, first, expedition, to, punt, during, the, middle, kingdom, using, ships, constructed, at, the, end, of, wadi, hammamat, on, the, red, sea, mentuhotep, iii, was, succeeded, by, mentuhotep, iv, whose, name, significantly, is, omitted, from, all, ancient, egyptian, king, lists, the, turin, king, list, claims, that, after, mentuhotep, iii, came, seven, kingless, years, despite, this, absence, his, reign, is, attested, from, a, few, inscriptions, in, wadi, hammamat, that, record, expeditions, to, the, red, sea, coast, and, to, quarry, stone, for, the, royal, monuments, the, leader, of, this, expedition, was, his, vizier, amenemhat, who, is, widely, assumed, to, be, the, future, pharaoh, amenemhet, i, the, first, king, of, the, twelfth, dynasty, mentuhotep, iv, s, absence, from, the, king, lists, has, prompted, the, theory, that, amenemhet, i, usurped, his, throne, while, there, are, no, contemporary, accounts, of, this, struggle, certain, circumstantial, evidence, may, point, to, the, existence, of, a, civil, war, at, the, end, of, the, 11th, dynasty, inscriptions, left, by, one, nehry, the, haty, a, of, hermopolis, suggest, that, he, was, attacked, at, a, place, called, shedyet, sha, by, the, forces, of, the, reigning, king, but, his, forces, prevailed, khnumhotep, i, an, official, under, amenemhet, i, claims, to, have, participated, in, a, flotilla, of, twenty, ships, sent, to, pacify, upper, egypt, donald, redford, has, suggested, these, events, should, be, interpreted, as, evidence, of, open, war, between, two, dynastic, claimants, what, is, certain, is, that, however, he, came, to, power, amenemhet, i, was, not, of, royal, birth, from, the, twelfth, dynasty, onwards, pharaohs, often, kept, well, trained, standing, armies, which, included, nubian, contingents, these, formed, the, basis, of, larger, forces, that, were, raised, for, defense, against, invasion, or, expeditions, up, the, nile, or, across, the, sinai, however, the, middle, kingdom, was, basically, defensive, in, its, military, strategy, with, fortifications, built, at, the, first, cataract, of, the, nile, in, the, delta, and, across, the, sinai, isthmus, early, in, his, reign, amenemhet, i, was, compelled, to, campaign, in, the, delta, region, which, had, not, received, as, much, attention, as, upper, egypt, during, the, 11th, dynasty, also, he, strengthened, defenses, between, egypt, and, asia, building, the, walls, of, the, ruler, in, the, east, delta, region, perhaps, in, response, to, this, perpetual, unrest, amenemhat, i, built, a, new, capital, for, egypt, in, the, north, known, as, amenemhet, it, tawy, or, amenemhet, seizer, of, the, two, lands, the, location, of, this, capital, is, unknown, but, is, presumably, near, the, city, s, necropolis, the, present, day, el, lisht, like, mentuhotep, ii, amenemhet, bolstered, his, claim, to, authority, with, propaganda, in, particular, the, prophecy, of, neferty, dates, to, about, this, time, which, purports, to, be, an, oracle, of, an, old, kingdom, priest, who, predicts, a, king, amenemhet, i, arising, from, the, far, south, of, egypt, to, restore, the, kingdom, after, centuries, of, chaos, propaganda, notwithstanding, amenemhet, never, held, the, absolute, power, commanded, in, theory, by, the, old, kingdom, pharaohs, during, the, first, intermediate, period, the, governors, of, the, nomes, of, egypt, nomarchs, gained, considerable, power, their, posts, had, become, hereditary, and, some, nomarchs, entered, into, marriage, alliances, with, the, nomarchs, of, neighboring, nomes, to, strengthen, his, position, amenemhet, required, registration, of, land, modified, nome, borders, and, appointed, nomarchs, directly, when, offices, became, vacant, but, acquiesced, to, the, nomarch, system, probably, to, placate, the, nomarchs, who, supported, his, rule, this, gave, the, middle, kingdom, a, more, feudal, organization, than, egypt, had, before, or, would, have, afterward, in, his, twentieth, regnal, year, amenemhat, established, his, son, senusret, i, as, his, coregent, beginning, a, practice, which, would, be, used, repeatedly, throughout, the, rest, of, the, middle, kingdom, and, again, during, the, new, kingdom, in, amenemhet, s, thirtieth, regnal, year, he, was, presumably, murdered, in, a, palace, conspiracy, senusret, campaigning, against, libyan, invaders, rushed, home, to, itjtawy, to, prevent, a, takeover, of, the, government, during, his, reign, senusret, continued, the, practice, of, directly, appointing, nomarchs, and, undercut, the, autonomy, of, local, priesthoods, by, building, at, cult, centers, throughout, egypt, under, his, rule, egyptian, armies, pushed, south, into, nubia, as, far, as, the, second, cataract, building, a, border, fort, at, buhen, and, incorporating, all, of, lower, nubia, as, an, egyptian, colony, senusret, i, also, exercised, control, over, the, land, of, kush, from, the, second, to, the, third, cataract, including, the, island, of, sai, the, southernmost, inscription, containing, sesostris, i, s, name, has, been, found, on, the, island, of, argo, north, of, modern, dongola, to, the, west, he, consolidated, his, power, over, the, oases, and, extended, commercial, contacts, into, syria, palestine, as, far, as, ugarit, in, his, 43rd, regnal, year, senusret, appointed, amenemhet, ii, as, junior, coregent, before, dying, in, his, 46th, the, reign, of, amenemhat, ii, has, been, often, characterized, as, largely, peaceful, but, records, of, his, genut, or, daybooks, have, cast, doubt, on, that, assessment, among, these, records, preserved, on, temple, walls, at, tod, and, memphis, are, descriptions, of, peace, treaties, with, certain, syrio, palestinian, cities, and, military, conflict, with, others, to, the, south, amenemhet, sent, a, campaign, through, lower, nubia, to, inspect, wawat, it, does, not, appear, that, amenemhet, continued, his, predecessors, policy, of, appointing, nomarchs, but, let, it, become, hereditary, again, another, expedition, to, punt, dates, to, his, reign, in, his, 33rd, regnal, year, he, appointed, his, son, senusret, ii, coregent, evidence, for, military, activity, of, any, kind, during, the, reign, of, senusret, ii, is, non, existent, senusret, instead, appears, to, have, focused, on, domestic, issues, particularly, the, irrigation, of, the, faiyum, this, multi, generational, project, aimed, to, convert, the, faiyum, oasis, into, a, productive, swath, of, farmland, senusret, eventually, placed, his, pyramid, at, the, site, of, el, lahun, near, the, junction, of, the, nile, and, the, fayuum, s, major, irrigation, canal, the, bahr, yussef, he, reigned, only, fifteen, years, which, explains, the, incomplete, nature, of, many, of, his, constructions, his, son, senusret, iii, succeeded, him, senusret, iii, was, a, warrior, king, often, taking, to, the, field, himself, in, his, sixth, year, he, re, dredged, an, old, kingdom, canal, around, the, first, cataract, to, facilitate, travel, to, upper, nubia, he, used, this, to, launch, a, series, of, brutal, campaigns, in, nubia, in, his, sixth, eighth, tenth, and, sixteenth, years, after, his, victories, senusret, built, a, series, of, massive, forts, throughout, the, country, to, establish, the, formal, boundary, between, egyptian, conquests, and, unconquered, nubia, at, semna, the, personnel, of, these, forts, were, charged, to, send, frequent, reports, to, the, capital, on, the, movements, and, activities, of, the, local, medjay, natives, some, of, which, survive, revealing, how, tightly, the, egyptians, intended, to, control, the, southern, border, medjay, were, not, allowed, north, of, the, border, by, ship, nor, could, they, enter, by, land, with, their, flocks, but, they, were, permitted, to, travel, to, local, forts, to, trade, after, this, senusret, sent, one, more, campaign, in, his, 19th, year, but, turned, back, due, to, abnormally, low, nile, levels, which, endangered, his, ships, to, the, north, one, of, senusret, s, soldiers, records, a, campaign, into, palestine, perhaps, against, shechem, the, only, reference, to, a, military, campaign, against, a, certain, location, in, palestine, from, middle, kingdom, literature, although, there, are, other, references, to, action, against, asiatics, it, is, not, known, whether, egypt, wished, to, control, canaan, like, northern, nubia, but, numerous, administrative, seals, of, the, period, have, been, found, there, as, well, as, other, indications, of, increased, activity, northward, in, this, period, as, in, the, old, kingdom, the, contact, was, particularly, strong, with, byblos, known, for, its, valuable, wood, domestically, senusret, has, been, given, credit, for, an, administrative, reform, that, put, more, power, in, the, hands, of, appointees, of, the, central, government, instead, of, regional, authorities, egypt, was, divided, into, three, water, or, administrative, divisions, north, south, and, head, of, the, south, perhaps, lower, egypt, most, of, upper, egypt, and, the, nomes, of, the, original, theban, kingdom, during, the, war, with, herakleopolis, respectively, each, region, was, administered, by, a, reporter, second, reporter, some, kind, of, council, the, djadjat, and, staff, of, minor, officials, and, scribes, the, power, of, the, nomarchs, seems, to, drop, off, permanently, during, his, reign, which, has, been, taken, to, indicate, that, the, central, government, had, finally, suppressed, them, though, there, is, no, record, that, senusret, ever, took, direct, action, against, them, senusret, iii, left, a, lasting, legacy, as, a, warrior, pharaoh, his, name, was, hellenized, by, later, greek, historians, as, sesostris, a, name, which, was, then, given, to, a, conflation, of, senusret, and, several, new, kingdom, warrior, pharaohs, in, nubia, senusret, was, worshiped, as, a, patron, god, by, egyptian, settlers, the, duration, of, his, reign, remains, something, of, an, open, question, his, son, amenemhet, iii, began, reigning, after, senusret, s, 19th, regnal, year, which, has, been, widely, considered, senusret, s, highest, attested, date, however, a, reference, to, a, year, 39, on, a, fragment, found, in, the, construction, debris, of, senusret, s, mortuary, temple, has, suggested, the, possibility, of, a, long, coregency, with, his, son, the, reign, of, amenemhat, iii, was, the, height, of, the, middle, kingdom, s, economic, prosperity, his, reign, is, remarkable, for, the, degree, to, which, egypt, exploited, its, resources, mining, camps, in, the, sinai, which, had, previously, been, used, only, by, intermittent, expeditions, were, operated, on, a, semi, permanent, basis, as, evidenced, by, the, construction, of, houses, walls, and, even, local, cemeteries, there, are, 25, separate, references, to, mining, expeditions, in, the, sinai, and, four, to, expeditions, in, wadi, hammamat, one, of, which, had, over, two, thousand, workers, amenemhet, reinforced, his, father, s, defenses, in, nubia, and, continued, the, faiyum, land, reclamation, project, after, a, reign, of, 45, years, amenemhet, iii, was, succeeded, by, amenemhet, iv, whose, nine, year, reign, is, poorly, attested, clearly, by, this, time, dynastic, power, had, begun, to, weaken, for, which, several, explanations, have, been, proposed, contemporary, records, of, the, nile, flood, levels, indicate, that, the, end, of, the, reign, of, amenemhet, iii, was, dry, and, crop, failures, may, have, helped, to, destabilize, the, dynasty, further, amenemhet, iii, had, an, inordinately, long, reign, which, tends, to, create, succession, problems, the, latter, argument, perhaps, explains, why, amenemhet, iv, was, succeeded, by, sobekneferu, the, first, historically, attested, female, pharaoh, of, egypt, sobekneferu, ruled, no, more, than, four, years, and, as, she, apparently, had, no, heirs, when, she, died, the, twelfth, dynasty, came, to, a, sudden, end, as, did, the, golden, age, of, the, middle, kingdom, after, the, death, of, sobeknefru, the, throne, may, have, passed, to, sekhemre, khutawy, sobekhotep, though, in, older, studies, wegaf, who, had, previously, been, the, great, overseer, of, troops, was, thought, to, have, reigned, next, beginning, with, this, reign, egypt, was, ruled, by, a, series, of, ephemeral, kings, for, about, ten, to, fifteen, years, ancient, egyptian, sources, regard, these, as, the, first, kings, of, the, thirteenth, dynasty, though, the, term, dynasty, is, misleading, as, most, kings, of, the, thirteenth, dynasty, were, not, related, the, names, of, these, short, lived, kings, are, attested, on, a, few, monuments, and, graffiti, and, their, succession, order, is, only, known, from, the, turin, canon, although, even, this, is, not, fully, trusted, after, the, initial, dynastic, chaos, a, series, of, longer, reigning, better, attested, kings, ruled, for, about, fifty, to, eighty, years, the, strongest, king, of, this, period, neferhotep, i, ruled, for, eleven, years, and, maintained, effective, control, of, upper, egypt, nubia, and, the, delta, with, the, possible, exceptions, of, xois, and, avaris, neferhotep, i, was, even, recognized, as, the, suzerain, of, the, ruler, of, byblos, indicating, that, the, thirteenth, dynasty, was, able, to, retain, much, of, the, power, of, the, twelfth, dynasty, at, least, up, to, his, reign, at, some, point, during, the, 13th, dynasty, xois, and, avaris, began, governing, themselves, the, rulers, of, xois, being, the, fourteenth, dynasty, and, the, asiatic, rulers, of, avaris, being, the, hyksos, of, the, fifteenth, dynasty, according, to, manetho, this, latter, revolt, occurred, during, the, reign, of, neferhotep, s, successor, sobekhotep, iv, though, there, is, no, archaeological, evidence, sobekhotep, iv, was, succeeded, by, the, short, reign, of, sobekhotep, v, who, was, followed, by, wahibre, ibiau, then, merneferre, ai, wahibre, ibiau, ruled, ten, years, and, merneferre, ai, ruled, for, twenty, three, years, the, longest, of, any, thirteenth, dynasty, king, but, neither, of, these, two, kings, left, as, many, attestations, as, either, neferhotep, of, sobekhotep, iv, despite, this, they, both, seem, to, have, held, at, least, parts, of, lower, egypt, after, merneferre, ai, however, no, king, left, his, name, on, any, object, found, outside, the, south, this, begins, the, final, portion, of, the, thirteenth, dynasty, when, southern, kings, continue, to, reign, over, upper, egypt, but, when, the, unity, of, egypt, fully, disintegrated, the, middle, kingdom, gave, way, to, the, second, intermediate, period, when, the, eleventh, dynasty, reunified, egypt, it, had, to, create, a, centralized, administration, such, as, had, not, existed, in, egypt, since, the, downfall, of, the, old, kingdom, government, to, do, this, it, appointed, people, to, positions, that, had, fallen, out, of, use, in, the, decentralized, first, intermediate, period, the, highest, among, these, was, the, vizier, the, vizier, was, the, chief, minister, for, the, king, handling, all, the, day, to, day, business, of, government, in, the, king, s, place, this, was, a, monumental, task, therefore, it, would, often, be, split, into, two, positions, a, vizier, of, the, north, and, a, vizier, of, the, south, it, is, uncertain, how, often, this, occurred, during, the, middle, kingdom, but, senusret, i, clearly, had, two, simultaneously, functioning, viziers, other, positions, were, inherited, from, the, provincial, form, of, government, at, thebes, used, by, the, eleventh, dynasty, before, the, reunification, of, egypt, the, overseer, of, sealed, goods, became, the, country, s, treasurer, and, the, overseer, of, the, estate, became, the, king, s, chief, steward, these, three, positions, and, the, scribe, of, the, royal, document, probably, the, king, s, personal, scribe, appear, to, be, the, most, important, posts, of, the, central, government, judging, by, the, monument, count, of, those, in, these, positions, besides, this, many, old, kingdom, posts, which, had, lost, their, original, meaning, and, become, mere, honorifics, were, brought, back, into, the, central, government, only, high, ranking, officials, could, claim, the, title, member, of, the, elite, which, had, been, applied, liberally, during, the, first, intermediate, period, this, basic, form, of, administration, continued, throughout, the, middle, kingdom, though, there, is, some, evidence, of, a, major, reform, of, the, central, government, under, senusret, iii, records, from, his, reign, indicate, that, upper, and, lower, egypt, were, divided, into, separate, waret, and, governed, by, separate, administrators, administrative, documents, and, private, stelae, indicate, a, proliferation, of, new, bureaucratic, titles, around, this, time, which, have, been, taken, as, evidence, of, a, larger, central, government, governance, of, the, royal, residence, was, moved, into, a, separate, division, of, government, the, military, was, placed, under, the, control, of, a, chief, general, however, it, is, possible, that, these, titles, and, positions, were, much, older, and, simply, were, not, recorded, on, funerary, stelae, due, to, religious, conventions, decentralization, during, the, first, intermediate, period, left, the, individual, egyptian, provinces, or, nomes, under, the, control, of, powerful, families, who, held, the, hereditary, title, of, great, chief, of, the, nome, or, nomarch, this, position, developed, during, the, fifth, and, sixth, dynasties, when, the, various, powers, of, old, kingdom, provincial, officials, began, to, be, exercised, by, a, single, individual, at, roughly, this, time, the, provincial, aristocracy, began, building, elaborate, tombs, for, themselves, which, have, been, taken, as, evidence, of, the, wealth, and, power, that, these, rulers, had, acquired, as, nomarchs, by, the, end, of, the, first, intermediate, period, some, nomarchs, ruled, their, nomes, as, minor, potentates, such, as, the, nomarch, nehry, of, hermopolis, who, dated, inscriptions, by, his, own, regnal, year, when, the, eleventh, dynasty, came, to, power, it, was, necessary, to, subdue, the, power, of, the, nomarchs, if, egypt, were, to, be, reunified, under, a, central, government, the, first, major, steps, towards, that, end, took, place, under, amenemhet, i, amenemhet, made, the, city, not, the, nome, the, center, of, administration, and, only, the, haty, a, or, mayor, of, the, larger, cities, would, be, permitted, to, carry, the, title, of, nomarch, the, title, of, nomarch, continued, to, be, used, until, the, reign, of, senusret, iii, as, did, the, elaborate, tombs, indicative, of, their, power, after, which, they, suddenly, disappeared, this, has, been, interpreted, several, ways, traditionally, it, has, been, believed, that, senusret, iii, took, some, action, to, suppress, the, nomarch, families, during, his, reign, recently, other, interpretations, have, been, proposed, detlef, franke, has, argued, that, senusret, ii, adopted, a, policy, of, educating, the, sons, of, nomarchs, in, the, capital, and, appointing, them, to, government, posts, in, this, way, many, provincial, families, may, have, been, bled, dry, of, scions, also, while, the, title, of, great, overlord, of, the, nome, disappeared, other, distinctive, titles, of, the, nomarchs, remained, during, the, first, intermediate, period, individuals, holding, the, title, of, great, overlord, also, often, held, the, title, of, overseer, of, priests, in, the, late, middle, kingdom, there, existed, families, holding, the, titles, of, mayor, and, overseer, of, priests, as, hereditary, possessions, therefore, it, has, been, argued, that, the, great, nomarch, families, were, never, subdued, but, were, simply, absorbed, into, the, pharaonic, administration, of, the, country, while, it, is, true, that, the, large, tombs, indicative, of, nomarchs, disappeared, at, the, end, of, the, twelfth, dynasty, grand, royal, tombs, also, ceased, being, built, soon, thereafter, due, to, general, instability, surrounding, the, decline, of, the, middle, kingdom, it, was, i, who, brought, forth, grain, the, grain, god, loved, me, the, nile, adored, me, from, his, every, source, one, did, not, hunger, during, my, years, did, not, thirst, they, sat, content, with, all, my, deeds, remembering, me, fondly, and, i, set, each, thing, firmly, in, its, place, extract, from, the, instructions, of, amenemhat, throughout, the, history, of, ancient, egypt, the, annual, inundation, of, the, nile, river, was, relied, upon, to, fertilize, the, land, surrounding, it, this, was, essential, for, agriculture, and, food, production, there, is, evidence, that, the, collapse, of, the, previous, old, kingdom, may, have, been, due, in, part, to, low, flood, levels, resulting, in, famine, this, trend, appears, to, have, been, reversed, during, the, early, years, of, the, middle, kingdom, with, relatively, high, water, levels, recorded, for, much, of, this, era, with, an, average, inundation, of, 19, meters, above, its, non, flood, levels, the, years, of, repeated, high, inundation, levels, correspond, to, the, most, prosperous, period, of, the, middle, kingdom, which, occurred, during, the, reign, of, amenemhat, iii, this, seems, to, be, confirmed, in, some, of, the, literature, of, the, period, such, as, in, the, instructions, of, amenemhat, where, the, king, tells, his, son, how, agriculture, prospered, under, his, reign, after, the, reunification, of, egypt, in, the, middle, kingdom, the, kings, of, the, eleventh, and, twelfth, dynasties, were, able, to, turn, their, focus, back, to, art, in, the, eleventh, dynasty, the, kings, had, their, monuments, made, in, a, style, influenced, by, the, memphite, models, of, the, fifth, and, early, sixth, dynasties, during, this, time, the, pre, unification, theban, relief, style, all, but, disappeared, these, changes, had, an, ideological, purpose, as, the, eleventh, dynasty, kings, were, establishing, a, centralized, state, after, the, first, intermediate, period, and, returning, to, the, political, ideals, of, the, old, kingdom, in, the, early, twelfth, dynasty, the, artwork, had, a, uniformity, of, style, due, to, the, influence, of, the, royal, workshops, it, was, at, this, point, that, the, quality, of, artistic, production, for, the, elite, members, of, society, reached, a, high, point, that, was, never, surpassed, although, it, was, equaled, in, other, periods, egypt, prospered, in, the, late, twelfth, dynasty, and, this, was, reflected, in, the, quality, of, the, materials, used, for, royal, and, private, monuments, the, kings, of, the, twelfth, dynasty, were, buried, in, pyramid, complexes, based, on, those, of, the, fifth, and, sixth, dynasties, in, the, old, kingdom, these, were, made, of, stone, bricks, but, the, middle, kingdom, kings, chose, to, have, theirs, made, of, mud, bricks, and, finished, with, a, casing, of, tura, limestone, private, tombs, such, as, those, found, in, thebes, usually, consisted, of, a, long, passage, cut, into, rock, with, a, small, chamber, at, the, end, these, tended, to, have, little, or, no, decoration, stone, box, sarcophagi, with, both, flat, and, vaulted, lids, were, manufactured, in, the, middle, kingdom, as, a, continuation, of, the, old, kingdom, tradition, the, motifs, on, these, were, more, varied, and, of, higher, artistic, quality, than, that, of, any, sarcophagi, produced, before, and, after, the, middle, kingdom, additionally, funerary, stelae, developed, in, regard, to, images, and, iconography, they, continued, to, show, the, deceased, seated, in, front, of, a, table, of, offerings, and, began, to, include, the, deceased, s, wife, and, other, family, members, towards, the, end, of, the, middle, kingdom, there, was, a, change, to, the, art, pieces, placed, in, non, royal, tombs, the, amount, of, wooden, tomb, models, decreased, drastically, and, they, were, replaced, by, small, faience, models, of, food, magic, wands, and, rods, models, of, protective, animals, and, fertility, figures, began, to, be, buried, with, the, dead, additionally, the, number, of, statues, and, funerary, stelae, increased, but, their, quality, decreased, in, the, late, twelfth, dynasty, coffins, with, interior, decorations, became, rare, and, the, decorations, on, the, outside, became, more, elaborate, the, rishi, coffin, made, its, first, appearance, during, this, time, made, of, wood, or, cartonnage, the, coffin, was, in, the, shape, of, a, body, wrapped, in, linen, wearing, a, beaded, collar, and, a, funerary, mask, there, were, also, changes, to, the, art, form, of, stelae, in, the, middle, kingdom, during, this, time, round, topped, stelae, developed, out, of, the, rectangular, form, of, previous, periods, many, examples, of, both, of, these, types, come, from, this, period, excavation, at, abydos, yielded, over, 2000, private, stelae, ranging, from, excellent, works, to, crude, objects, although, very, few, belonged, to, the, elite, additionally, classic, royal, commemorative, stelae, were, first, found, in, this, period, these, took, the, form, of, round, topped, stelae, and, they, were, used, to, mark, boundaries, for, example, senusret, iii, used, them, to, mark, the, boundary, between, egypt, and, nubia, because, of, the, prosperity, of, this, period, the, lower, elite, were, able, to, commission, statues, and, stelae, for, themselves, although, these, were, of, poorer, artistic, quality, those, who, commissioned, non, royal, stelae, had, the, ultimate, goal, of, eternal, existence, this, goal, was, communicated, with, the, specific, placement, of, information, on, the, stone, slabs, similar, to, royal, stelae, the, owner, s, image, offering, formula, inscriptions, of, names, lineage, and, titles, in, the, first, half, of, the, twelfth, dynasty, proportions, of, the, human, figure, returned, to, the, traditional, memphite, style, of, the, fifth, and, early, sixth, dynasties, male, figures, had, broad, shoulders, a, low, small, of, the, back, and, thick, muscular, limbs, females, had, slender, figures, a, higher, small, of, the, back, and, no, musculature, in, this, period, sketches, for, the, production, of, statues, and, reliefs, were, laid, out, on, a, squared, grid, a, new, guide, system, since, this, system, contained, a, greater, number, of, lines, it, allowed, more, body, parts, to, be, marked, standing, figures, were, composed, of, eighteen, squares, from, the, feet, to, the, hairline, seated, figures, were, made, of, fourteen, squares, between, their, feet, and, hairline, accounting, for, the, horizontal, thigh, and, knee, the, black, granite, seated, statue, of, the, king, amenemhat, iii, to, the, right, above, is, a, perfect, example, of, male, proportions, and, the, squared, grid, system, of, this, period, most, royal, statues, such, as, this, one, would, serve, as, representations, of, the, king, s, power, the, quality, of, egyptian, statuary, reached, its, peak, in, the, middle, kingdom, royal, statues, combined, both, elegance, and, strength, in, a, manner, that, was, seldom, seen, after, this, period, a, popular, form, of, statuary, during, this, time, was, that, of, the, sphinx, during, this, period, sphinxes, appeared, in, pairs, and, were, recumbent, with, human, faces, and, a, lion, s, mane, and, ears, an, example, would, be, the, diorite, sphinx, of, senusret, iii, one, of, the, innovations, in, sculpture, that, occurred, during, the, middle, kingdom, was, the, block, statue, which, would, continue, to, be, popular, through, to, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, almost, 2, 000, years, later, block, statues, consist, of, a, man, squatting, with, his, knees, drawn, up, to, his, chest, and, his, arms, folded, on, top, of, his, knees, often, these, men, are, wearing, a, wide, cloak, that, reduces, the, body, of, the, figure, to, a, simple, block, like, shape, the, surface, of, the, garment, or, wide, cloak, allowed, space, for, inscriptions, most, of, the, detail, is, reserved, for, the, head, of, the, individual, being, depicted, in, some, instances, the, modeling, of, the, limbs, has, been, retained, by, the, sculptor, there, are, two, basic, types, of, block, statues, ones, with, the, feet, completely, covered, by, the, cloak, and, ones, with, the, feet, uncovered, this, statue, to, the, right, represents, a, woman, from, the, top, echelon, of, society, and, demonstrates, characteristics, of, middle, kingdom, art, the, heavy, tripartite, wig, frames, the, broad, face, and, passes, behind, the, ears, thus, giving, the, impression, of, forcing, them, forward, they, are, large, in, keeping, with, the, ancient, egyptian, ideal, of, beauty, the, same, ideal, required, small, breasts, and, also, in, this, respect, the, sculpture, is, no, exception, whereas, the, natural, curve, of, the, eyebrows, dips, towards, the, root, of, the, nose, the, artificial, eyebrows, in, low, relief, are, absolutely, straight, above, the, inner, corners, of, the, eyes, a, feature, which, places, the, bust, early, in, the, twelfth, dynasty, around, 1900, bc, these, artificial, eyebrows, began, to, follow, the, natural, curve, and, dip, toward, the, nose, in, the, later, twelfth, dynasty, the, proportions, of, the, human, figure, changed, these, changes, survived, through, the, thirteenth, to, seventeenth, dynasties, male, figures, had, smaller, heads, in, proportion, to, the, rest, of, the, body, narrow, shoulders, and, waists, a, high, small, of, the, back, and, no, muscled, limbs, female, figures, had, these, proportions, more, to, an, extreme, with, narrower, shoulders, and, waists, slender, limbs, and, a, higher, small, of, the, back, in, order, to, keep, a, distinction, between, male, and, female, measurements, richard, b, parkinson, and, ludwig, d, morenz, write, that, ancient, egyptian, literature, narrowly, defined, as, belles, lettres, beautiful, writing, were, not, recorded, in, written, form, until, the, early, twelfth, dynasty, old, kingdom, texts, served, mainly, to, maintain, the, divine, cults, preserve, souls, in, the, afterlife, and, document, accounts, for, practical, uses, in, daily, life, it, was, not, until, the, middle, kingdom, that, texts, were, written, for, the, purpose, of, entertainment, and, intellectual, curiosity, parkinson, and, morenz, also, speculate, that, written, works, of, the, middle, kingdom, were, transcriptions, of, the, oral, literature, of, the, old, kingdom, it, is, known, that, some, oral, poetry, was, preserved, in, later, writing, for, example, litter, bearers, songs, were, preserved, as, written, verses, in, tomb, inscriptions, of, the, old, kingdom, it, is, also, thought, that, the, growth, of, the, middle, class, and, growth, in, the, number, of, scribes, needed, for, the, expanded, bureaucracy, under, senusret, ii, helped, spur, the, development, of, middle, kingdom, literature, later, ancient, egyptians, considered, the, literature, from, this, time, as, classic, stories, such, as, the, tale, of, the, shipwrecked, sailor, and, the, story, of, sinuhe, were, composed, during, this, period, and, were, popular, enough, to, be, widely, copied, afterwards, many, philosophical, works, were, also, created, at, this, time, including, the, dispute, between, a, man, and, his, ba, where, an, unhappy, man, converses, with, his, soul, the, satire, of, the, trades, in, which, the, role, of, the, scribe, is, praised, above, all, other, jobs, and, the, magic, tales, supposedly, told, to, the, old, kingdom, pharaoh, khufu, in, the, westcar, papyrus, pharaohs, of, the, twelfth, through, eighteenth, dynasty, are, credited, with, preserving, some, of, the, most, interesting, of, egyptian, papyri
