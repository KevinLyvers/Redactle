during, the, han, dynasty, however, all, calculations, are, speculations, and, extrapolations, due, to, difficulties, stemming, from, time, intervals, the, book, of, the, later, han, quotes, huangfu, mi, s, work, diwang, shiji, which, claims, that, when, yu, the, great, finished, establishing, the, nine, provinces, the, total, population, was, 13, 553, 923, individuals, however, this, number, is, highly, speculative, because, huangfu, mi, reached, his, conclusion, by, extrapolating, from, demographic, statuses, of, the, qin, han, jin, dynasties, modern, chinese, scholars, estimated, the, xia, s, population, by, employing, records, from, ancient, texts, records, have, it, that, when, tai, kang, established, lun, as, his, capital, the, settlement, had, about, one, lu, which, was, 500,

around, 2, 1, million, the, time, gap, between, the, supposed, time, of, the, xia, and, the, first, written, references, to, it, have, meant, that, the, historicity, of, the, xia, dynasty, itself, and, the, traditional, narrative, of, its, history, are, at, best, uncertain, the, doubting, antiquity, school, led, by, gu, jiegang, in, the, 1920s, were, the, first, scholars, within, china, to, systematically, question, the, traditional, story, of, its, early, history, by, critically, examining, the, development, of, the, narrative, of, early, chinese, history, throughout, history, gu, concluded, the, later, the, time, the, longer, the, legendary, period, of, earlier, history, early, chinese, history, is, a, tale, told, and, retold, for, generations, during, which, new, elements, were, added, to, the, front, end, some, historians, have, suggested, that, the, zhou, rulers, invented, the, xia, as, a, pretext, to, justify, their, conquest, of, the, shang, by, noting, that, just, as, the, shang, had, supplanted, the, xia, they, had, supplanted, the, shang, the, existence, of, the, xia, remains, unproven, despite, efforts, by, chinese, archaeologists, to, link, them, with, the, bronze, age, erlitou, culture, among, other, points, gu, and, other, historians, note, certain, parallels, between, the, traditional, narrative, of, xia, history, and, shang, history, that, would, suggest, probable, zhou, era, fabrication, or, at, least, embellishment, of, xia, history, yun, kuen, lee, s, criticism, of, nationalist, sentiment, in, developing, an, explanation, of, three, dynasties, chronology, focuses, on, the, dichotomy, of, evidence, provided, by, archaeological, versus, historical, research, in, particular, the, claim, that, the, archaeological, erlitou, culture, is, also, the, historical, xia, dynasty, how, to, fuse, the, archaeological, dates, with, historical, dates, is, a, challenge, to, all, chronological, studies, of, early, civilization, in, the, shape, of, the, turtle, myth, art, and, cosmos, in, early, china, sarah, allan, noted, that, many, aspects, of, the, xia, are, simply, the, opposite, of, traits, held, to, be, emblematic, of, the, shang, the, implied, dualism, of, the, shang, myth, system, allan, argues, is, that, while, the, shang, represent, the, suns, sky, birds, east, and, life, the, xia, represent, the, moons, watery, underworld, dragons, west, and, death, allan, argues, that, this, mythical, xia, was, re, interpreted, by, the, zhou, as, a, ruling, dynasty, replaced, by, the, shang, a, parallel, with, their, own, replacement, of, the, shang, other, scholars, also, argue, that, shang, political, class, s, remnants, still, existed, during, the, early, zhou, dynasty, zhou, rulers, could, not, simply, justify, their, succession, to, pacify, shang, remnants, if, it, s, entirely, fabricated, since, the, shang, remnants, who, remembered, prior, histories, would, not, believe, it, in, the, first, place, for, example, the, classic, of, poetry, preserves, the, eulogies, of, shang, sh, ng, s, ng, which, represents, the, powerful, state, of, song, whose, rulers, were, the, direct, descendants, of, shang, dynasty, among, those, eulogies, the, eulogy, chang, fa, celebrated, victories, by, the, martial, king, tang, of, shang, against, wei, gu, kunwu, and, jie, of, xia, during, the, later, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, ad, an, ancient, bronze, artifact, shu, yi, zhong, was, unearthed, with, an, inscription, describing, how, the, founder, of, the, shang, dynasty, tang, overthrew, the, xia, dynasty, shu, yi, the, owner, of, this, artifact, was, a, high, officer, of, the, state, of, qi, during, the, spring, and, autumn, period, c, 600, bc, was, actually, a, direct, descendant, of, the, song, rulers, which, means, he, himself, was, a, descendant, of, shang, people, this, bronze, artifact, was, used, to, memorialize, his, shang, ancestors, the, inscription, contradicts, the, hypothesis, that, the, zhou, manufactured, the, existence, of, the, xia, although, the, shang, oracle, bone, inscriptions, contain, no, mention, of, the, xia, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, polities, they, mention, might, be, remnants, of, the, xia, guo, moruo, suggested, that, an, enemy, state, called, tufang, state, of, the, fang, states, mentioned, in, many, inscriptions, might, be, identified, with, the, xia, historian, shen, changyun, points, to, four, inscriptions, mentioning, qi, the, same, name, as, the, state, of, qi, which, according, to, traditional, accounts, was, established, by, the, defeated, royal, house, of, xia, inspired, by, the, discovery, of, the, late, shang, capital, yinxu, near, modern, anyang, chinese, archaeologists, searched, the, yellow, river, basin, for, earlier, capitals, in, 1959, xu, xusheng, conducted, a, survey, of, the, yi, luo, basin, which, he, had, identified, from, received, texts, as, a, possible, location, of, xia, capitals, among, his, discoveries, was, the, large, bronze, age, site, of, erlitou, near, modern, yanshi, the, site, was, an, urban, centre, with, rammed, earth, foundations, of, several, buildings, which, were, interpreted, as, palaces, or, temples, radiocarbon, dating, in, the, late, 20th, century, had, wide, error, margins, and, placed, the, erlitou, culture, between, 2100, and, 1300, bc, which, fit, well, with, the, traditional, dates, of, the, xia, most, chinese, archaeologists, identify, the, xia, with, erlitou, while, many, western, archaeologists, argue, that, the, identification, and, indeed, the, very, existence, of, xia, is, unprovable, due, to, the, lack, of, testable, detail, in, the, traditional, accounts, for, a, time, archaeologists, debated, which, of, the, four, phases, of, erlitou, should, be, interpreted, as, xia, and, which, as, shang, the, refined, dating, techniques, used, by, the, xia, shang, zhou, chronology, project, produced, a, narrower, range, for, the, erlitou, culture, of, 1880, to, 1520, bc, the, project, assigned, all, four, phases, of, erlitou, to, the, xia, and, identified, the, transition, to, the, shang, with, the, construction, of, walled, cities, at, yanshi, and, zhengzhou, around, 1600, bc, since, the, project, had, settled, on, a, start, date, for, the, xia, of, 2070, bc, based, on, received, texts, this, forced, them, to, designate, the, late, part, of, the, henan, longshan, culture, including, the, xinzhai, phase, as, the, early, part, of, the, xia, period, no, corresponding, cultural, transition, in, the, archaeological, record, has, yet, been, discovered, even, more, refined, carbon, dating, in, 2005, and, 2006, produced, more, tightly, defined, ranges, dating, xinzhai, at, 1870, 1720, bc, and, erlitou, at, 1735, 1530, bc, the, only, musical, instruments, found, at, erlitou, are, a, qing, sounding, stone, two, small, clapper, bells, one, earthenware, one, bronze, and, a, xun, with, one, finger, hole, due, to, this, extreme, scarcity, of, surviving, instruments, and, the, general, uncertainty, surrounding, most, of, the, xia, creating, a, musical, narrative, of, the, period, is, impractical, archaeological, evidence, of, a, large, outburst, flood, at, jishi, gorge, that, destroyed, the, lajia, site, on, the, upper, reaches, of, the, yellow, river, has, been, dated, to, c, 1920, bc, this, date, is, shortly, before, the, rise, of, the, erlitou, culture, in, the, middle, yellow, river, valley, and, the, yueshi, culture, in, shandong, following, the, decline, of, the, longshan, culture, in, the, north, china, plain, the, authors, suggest, that, this, flood, may, have, been, the, basis, for, the, later, myth, of, yu, the, great, and, contributed, to, the, cultural, transition, into, the, erlitou, period, they, further, argue, that, the, timing, is, further, evidence, for, the, identification, of, the, xia, with, the, erlitou, culture, however, no, evidence, of, contemporaneous, widespread, flooding, in, the, north, china, plain, has, yet, been, found, the, cambridge, history, of, ancient, china, 1999, takes, the, beginning, of, chinese, history, as, the, xia, s, successor, shang, dynasty, c, 1600, c, 1046, bc, xie, weiyang, responded, to, this, standpoint, unfavorably, towards, efforts, in, china, to, link, archaeological, research, to, historical, records, the, cambridge, history, of, ancient, china, adopted, this, standpoint, with, the, promise, of, providing, a, commonly, accepted, synthesis, based, on, an, exhaustive, discussion, of, the, latest, pre, qin, material, available, at, the, end, of, the, 1990s, this, is, of, extraordinary, significance, because, if, this, book, aims, to, provide, a, commonly, accepted, synthesis, then, the, blood, sweat, and, tears, of, chinese, scholars, over, the, past, decade, that, brought, about, countless, achievements, in, xia, period, research, will, become, a, joke, and, many, chinese, scholars, in, the, field, will, lose, all, sense, of, direction, and, not, know, how, to, get, back, on, the, right, track, however, as, chen, chun, and, gong, xin, point, out, the, debate, upon, the, xia, dynasty, s, historical, existence, stems, from, different, research, orientations, between, chinese, and, western, scholars, the, authors, assert, that, overseas, scientific, communities, are, hesitant, to, accept, the, results, of, chinese, researchers, because, their, studies, used, traditional, narratives, of, the, xia, as, a, guide, that, instructed, them, on, what, to, find, and, because, they, quickly, linked, newly, discovered, artifacts, constructions, and, other, evidences, as, representing, the, proof, for, the, xia, s, actual, existence, they, claim, that, mainland, chinese, scholars, focused, mainly, on, extrapolations, of, excavated, evidence, to, establish, a, historical, perspective, and, overlooked, other, complex, factors, in, ancient, human, activities, this, method, according, to, the, two, authors, resulted, in, high, levels, of, subjectivity, and, contradicted, the, common, trend, among, western, researchers, which, took, the, physical, discoveries, as, not, necessarily, representing, real, social, or, political, units, the, following, table, lists, the, rulers, of, xia, according, to, the, records, of, the, grand, historian, unlike, sima, s, list, of, shang, kings, which, is, closely, matched, by, inscriptions, on, oracle, bones, from, late, in, that, period, records, of, xia, rulers, have, not, yet, been, found, in, archaeological, excavations, of, contemporary, sites, or, records, on, later, shang, dynasty, oracle, bones
