chimor, also, kingdom, of, chimor, or, chim, empire, was, the, political, grouping, of, the, chim, culture, the, culture, arose, about, 900, ce, succeeding, the, moche, culture, and, was, later, conquered, by, the, inca, emperor, topa, inca, yupanqui, around, 1470, fifty, years, before, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, in, the, region, chimor, spanish, pronunciation, was, the, largest, kingdom, in, the, late, intermediate, period, encompassing, 1, 000, kilometres, 620, mi, of, coastline, according, to, chim, oral, history, the, history, of, chimor, began, with, the, arrival, of, taycanamo, in, the, moche, valley, from, the, sea, on, a, balsa, raft, from, there, his, descendants, would, conquer, surrounding, areas, starting, with, his, son, guacriur, guacricur, integrated, chim, reign, over, the, lower, valley, and, ancempinco, taycanamo, s, grandson, would, expand, the, kingdom, by, conquering, the, upper, valley, an, enpinco, began, to, further, expansion, both, north, and, south, of, the, moche, valleys, the, first, valleys, seem, to, have, joined, forces, willingly, but, the, sican, culture, was, acquired, through, conquest, they, also, were, significantly, influenced, by, the, pre, inca, cajamarca, and, wari, cultures, according, to, legend, its, capital, of, chan, chan, was, founded, by, taycanamo, who, arrived, in, the, area, by, sea, chimor, was, the, last, kingdom, that, had, any, chance, of, stopping, the, inca, empire, but, the, inca, conquest, began, in, the, 1470s, by, topa, inca, yupanqui, defeating, the, emperor, and, descendant, of, taycanamo, minchan, aman, and, was, nearly, complete, when, huayna, capac, assumed, the, throne, in, 1493, the, chim, resided, on, a, strip, of, desert, on, the, northern, coast, of, peru, the, rivers, in, the, region, carved, a, series, of, fertile, valley, plains, which, were, very, flat, and, well, suited, to, irrigation, agriculture, and, fishing, were, both, very, important, to, the, chim, economy, worshipping, the, moon, the, chim, unlike, the, inca, considered, it, more, powerful, than, the, sun, offerings, played, an, important, role, in, religious, rites, a, common, object, for, offerings, as, well, as, one, used, by, artisans, was, the, shell, of, the, spondylus, shellfish, which, resides, only, in, the, warm, coastal, waters, off, present, day, ecuador, associated, with, the, sea, rainfall, and, fertility, spondylus, shells, were, highly, valued, and, traded, by, the, chim, people, and, the, exchange, of, the, shells, played, a, significant, economic, and, political, role, in, the, empire, the, chim, people, are, best, known, for, their, distinctive, monochromatic, pottery, and, fine, metal, working, of, copper, gold, silver, bronze, and, tumbaga, copper, and, gold, the, pottery, is, often, in, the, shape, of, a, creature, or, has, a, human, figure, sitting, or, standing, on, a, cuboid, bottle, the, shiny, black, finish, of, most, chim, pottery, was, achieved, by, firing, the, pottery, at, high, temperatures, in, a, closed, kiln, which, prevented, oxygen, from, reacting, with, the, clay, the, oldest, civilization, present, on, the, north, coast, of, peru, is, the, moche, or, mochica, civilization, which, is, identified, as, early, chim, the, start, of, this, period, is, not, known, for, certain, but, it, ended, around, 700, ce, it, was, centered, in, the, chicama, moche, and, viru, valleys, many, large, pyramids, are, attributed, to, the, early, chim, period, 37, these, pyramids, are, built, of, adobe, in, rectangular, shapes, made, from, molds, early, chim, cemeteries, are, also, found, without, pyramid, associations, burials, are, usually, in, extended, positions, in, prepared, tombs, the, rectangular, adobe, lined, and, covered, tombs, have, niches, in, their, walls, in, which, bowls, were, placed, 39, the, early, pottery, is, also, characterized, by, realistic, modeling, and, painted, scenes, during, the, reign, of, the, wari, empire, over, peru, the, mature, chim, culture, developed, in, roughly, the, same, territory, where, the, mochica, had, existed, centuries, before, the, chim, was, also, a, coastal, culture, according, to, legend, its, capital, of, chan, chan, was, founded, by, taycanamo, who, arrived, in, the, area, by, sea, it, was, developed, in, the, moche, valley, north, of, present, day, lima, northeast, of, huarmey, and, finishing, in, central, present, day, trujillo, later, it, expanded, to, arequipa, during, this, time, arequipa, was, framed, by, 3, volcanoes, 39, the, chim, appeared, in, the, year, 900, chimor, also, known, as, the, kingdom, of, chimor, had, its, capital, at, the, great, site, now, called, chanchan, between, trujillo, and, the, sea, and, we, may, assume, that, taycanamo, founded, his, kingdom, there, his, son, guacri, caur, conquered, the, lower, part, of, the, valley, and, was, succeeded, by, a, son, named, nancen, pinco, who, really, laid, the, foundations, of, the, kingdom, by, conquering, the, head, of, the, valley, of, chimor, and, the, neighboring, valleys, of, sana, pacasmayo, chicama, viru, chao, and, santa, the, estimated, founding, date, of, the, last, chim, kingdom, is, in, the, first, half, of, the, fourteenth, century, nacen, pinco, was, believed, to, have, ruled, around, 1370, and, was, followed, by, seven, rulers, whose, names, are, not, yet, known, minchan, aman, followed, these, rulers, and, was, ruling, around, the, time, of, the, inca, conquest, between, 1462, and, 1470, this, great, expansion, is, believed, to, have, occurred, during, the, late, period, of, chim, civilization, called, late, chim, but, the, development, of, the, chim, territory, spanned, a, number, of, phases, and, more, than, a, single, generation, nacen, pinco, may, have, pushed, the, imperial, frontiers, to, jequetepeque, and, to, santa, but, conquest, of, the, entire, region, was, an, agglutinative, process, initiated, by, earlier, rulers, 17, the, chim, expanded, to, include, a, vast, area, and, many, different, ethnic, groups, the, first, valleys, seem, to, have, joined, forces, willingly, but, the, sican, culture, was, assimilated, through, conquest, at, its, peak, the, chim, advanced, to, the, limits, of, the, desert, coast, to, the, valley, of, the, jequetepeque, river, in, the, north, pampa, grande, in, the, lambayeque, valley, was, also, ruled, by, the, chim, to, the, south, they, expanded, as, far, as, carabayllo, their, expansion, southward, was, stopped, by, the, military, power, of, the, great, valley, of, lima, historians, and, archeologists, contest, how, far, south, they, managed, to, expand, life, in, the, chim, empire, from, what, scholars, can, tell, the, chim, had, a, complex, and, consolidated, empire, the, capitol, consisted, of, chan, chan, lower, class, workshops, and, homes, with, a, population, estimate, of, around, 30, 000, these, workshop, were, all, built, in, around, adobe, palaces, in, order, to, impose, social, hierarchy, ideals, the, chan, chan, also, had, restrictions, and, were, not, offered, the, same, privileges, as, the, elite, they, had, limited, access, to, rituals, bureaucracy, and, administrative, roles, the, high, regulations, were, necessary, to, keep, order, with, food, production, and, state, re, distribution, of, the, products, the, class, system, also, helped, to, determine, who, would, work, to, create, state, sponsored, monuments, the, chim, society, was, a, four, level, hierarchical, system, with, a, powerful, elite, rule, over, administrative, centers, the, hierarchy, was, centered, at, the, walled, cities, called, ciudadelas, at, chan, chan, the, political, power, at, chan, chan, is, demonstrated, by, the, organization, of, labor, to, construct, the, chim, s, canals, and, irrigated, fields, chan, chan, was, the, top, of, the, chimu, hierarchy, with, farf, n, in, the, jequetepeque, valley, as, a, subordinate, this, organization, which, was, quickly, established, during, the, conquest, of, the, jequetepeque, valley, suggests, the, chim, established, the, hierarchy, during, the, early, stages, of, their, expansion, the, existing, elite, at, peripheral, locations, such, as, the, jequetepeque, valley, and, other, centers, of, power, were, incorporated, into, the, chim, government, on, lower, levels, of, the, hierarchy, these, lower, order, centers, managed, land, water, and, labor, while, the, higher, order, centers, either, moved, the, resources, to, chan, chan, or, carried, out, other, administrative, decisions, rural, sites, were, used, as, engineering, headquarters, while, the, canals, were, being, built, later, they, operated, as, maintenance, sites, the, numerous, broken, bowls, found, at, quebrada, del, oso, support, this, theory, as, the, bowls, were, probably, used, to, feed, the, large, workforce, that, built, and, maintained, that, section, of, canal, the, workers, were, probably, fed, and, housed, at, state, expense, cultural, and, economic, exchange, the, chim, s, vast, territorial, expansion, increased, the, amount, of, cultural, identities, within, the, civilization, they, also, incorporated, political, ideologies, along, with, cultural, beliefs, this, is, seen, with, the, late, sic, n, in, the, north, and, the, casma, in, the, south, despite, this, many, areas, kept, distinctive, aspects, of, their, culture, and, some, gained, autonomy, after, the, conquest, it, has, been, argued, that, chim, leaders, conquered, territories, further, away, because, of, the, deviations, in, inheritance, the, opposition, to, this, is, that, an, el, ni, o, that, had, caused, the, state, to, increase, the, extractive, economy, in, place, and, get, supplies, from, other, areas, of, the, andes, this, el, ni, o, is, theorized, to, have, occurred, around, a, d, 1100, and, would, have, caused, the, destruction, of, irrigation, canals, both, arguments, suggest, that, agriculture, expansion, led, to, increased, identities, socially, and, politically, the, chim, conquered, the, jequetepeque, around, 1320, and, changed, the, political, structure, of, the, society, places, like, pacatnam, were, left, behind, and, other, sites, like, farf, n, had, increased, laborers, for, administrative, compounds, constructed, under, the, supervision, of, imperial, administrators, land, use, agricultural, methods, and, settlement, patterns, of, the, jequetepeque, societies, all, changed, after, the, conquest, many, households, had, to, see, tribute, requirements, and, agricultural, production, increased, the, state, governed, such, social, classes, until, the, empire, of, the, sican, culture, conquered, the, kingdom, of, lambayeque, peru, the, legends, of, war, were, said, to, have, been, told, by, the, leaders, naylamp, in, the, sican, language, and, taycanamo, in, chim, the, people, paid, tribute, to, the, rulers, with, products, or, labor, chimor, was, the, last, andean, kingdom, capable, of, stopping, the, inca, empire, but, the, inca, conquest, began, in, the, 1470s, by, topa, inca, yupanqui, defeating, the, emperor, minchan, aman, and, was, nearly, complete, when, huayna, capac, assumed, the, throne, in, 1493, they, moved, minchan, aman, the, final, chim, emperor, to, cusco, and, redirected, gold, and, silver, there, to, adorn, the, qurikancha, chan, chan, could, be, said, to, have, developed, a, bureaucracy, due, to, the, elite, s, controlled, access, to, information, the, economic, and, social, system, operated, through, the, import, of, raw, materials, where, they, were, processed, into, prestige, goods, by, artisans, at, chan, chan, the, elite, at, chan, chan, made, the, decisions, on, most, other, matters, concerning, organization, monopolizing, production, storage, of, food, and, products, and, distribution, or, consumption, of, goods, the, majority, of, the, citizens, in, each, ciudadela, were, artisans, in, the, late, chim, about, 12, 000, artisans, lived, and, worked, in, chan, chan, alone, they, engaged, in, fishing, agriculture, craft, work, and, trade, artisans, were, forbidden, to, change, their, profession, and, were, grouped, in, the, ciudadela, according, to, their, area, of, specialization, archeologists, have, noted, a, dramatic, increase, in, chim, craft, production, and, they, believe, that, artisans, may, have, been, brought, to, chan, chan, from, another, area, taken, as, a, result, of, chim, conquest, as, there, is, evidence, of, both, metalwork, and, weaving, in, the, same, domestic, unit, it, is, likely, that, both, men, and, women, were, artisans, they, engaged, in, fishing, agriculture, and, metallurgy, and, made, ceramics, and, textiles, from, cotton, and, the, wool, of, llama, alpaca, and, vicu, a, people, used, reed, fishing, canoes, displayed, in, the, image, on, the, right, hunted, and, traded, using, bronze, coins, the, chim, developed, mainly, through, intensive, farming, techniques, and, hydraulic, work, which, joined, valleys, to, form, complexes, such, as, the, chicama, moche, complex, which, was, a, combination, of, two, valleys, in, la, libertad, the, lambayeque, linked, the, valleys, of, la, leche, lambayeque, reque, and, sa, a, jequetepeque, they, developed, an, excellent, agricultural, techniques, which, expanded, the, strength, of, their, cultivated, areas, huachaques, were, sunken, farms, where, land, was, withdrawn, to, work, the, moist, sandy, soil, underneath, an, example, of, which, is, tschudi, the, chim, used, walk, in, wells, similar, to, those, of, the, nazca, to, draw, water, and, reservoirs, to, contain, the, water, from, rivers, this, system, increased, the, productivity, of, the, land, which, increased, chim, wealth, and, likely, contributed, to, the, formation, of, a, bureaucratic, system, the, chim, cultivated, beans, sweet, potato, papaya, and, cotton, with, their, reservoir, and, irrigation, system, this, focus, on, large, scale, irrigation, persisted, until, the, late, intermediate, period, at, this, point, there, was, a, shift, to, a, more, specialized, system, that, focused, on, importing, and, redistributing, resources, from, satellite, communities, there, appears, to, have, been, a, complex, network, of, sites, that, provided, goods, and, services, for, chim, subsistence, many, of, these, sites, produced, commodities, that, the, chim, could, not, many, sites, relied, on, marine, resources, but, after, the, advent, of, agriculture, there, were, more, sites, further, inland, where, marine, resources, were, harder, to, attain, keeping, llamas, arose, as, a, supplemental, way, of, attaining, meat, but, by, the, late, intermediate, period, and, late, horizon, inland, sites, used, llamas, as, a, main, resource, although, they, maintained, contact, with, coastal, sites, to, use, supplemental, marine, resources, they, also, made, masks, one, of, the, earliest, known, examples, of, distance, communication, is, a, chim, device, consisting, of, two, resin, coated, gourds, connected, by, a, 75, foot, length, of, twine, only, one, example, has, been, found, and, nothing, is, known, about, its, originator, or, use, the, chimu, capital, chan, chan, had, a, series, of, elite, residential, compounds, or, cuidadelas, that, were, not, occupied, simultaneously, but, sequentially, the, reason, for, this, is, that, chimu, rulers, practiced, split, inheritance, which, dictated, that, the, heir, to, the, throne, had, to, build, his, own, palace, after, the, death, of, a, ruler, all, the, ruler, s, wealth, would, be, distributed, to, more, distant, relatives, the, chim, people, highly, valued, mollusk, shell, for, its, economic, and, political, significance, as, a, luxury, good, traded, over, long, distances, and, the, shell, was, often, viewed, as, a, symbol, of, elite, status, and, divine, power, using, shell, as, a, medium, for, their, art, and, artifacts, the, chim, frequently, employed, the, shell, of, spondylus, a, type, of, marine, bivalve, mollusk, the, most, abundant, spondylus, species, present, in, peru, are, spondylus, calcifer, carpenter, and, spondylus, princeps, broderip, spondylus, calcifer, has, red, and, white, hues, primarily, used, for, beads, and, artifacts, while, this, species, resides, in, shallower, waters, and, is, easier, to, obtain, the, spondylus, princeps, known, as, the, thorny, oyster, for, its, characteristic, spines, is, a, solid, red, color, and, can, only, be, harvested, by, experienced, divers, thus, this, shell, is, more, highly, desired, and, traded, by, the, chim, people, spondylus, shell, had, a, wide, variety, of, uses, in, andean, culture, and, took, a, variety, of, forms, ranging, from, whole, shells, to, fragments, to, ground, shell, powder, this, material, was, worked, to, create, intricately, carved, ornaments, tools, and, goods, reserved, for, the, nobles, and, deities, shell, fragments, have, been, found, as, inlays, for, body, ornaments, and, as, beads, for, pieces, of, jewelry, the, image, to, the, right, displays, a, chim, collar, made, of, cotton, red, spondylus, shell, beads, and, black, stone, beads, and, the, image, below, displays, a, sling, shot, made, of, shell, representing, wealth, and, power, the, shell, was, ground, into, powder, and, spread, out, before, the, chimor, king, by, an, official, called, the, fonga, sigde, forming, a, red, carpet, for, the, ruler, as, he, walked, shell, were, likewise, used, for, ornamentation, of, certain, buildings, and, architectural, structures, found, in, the, tombs, of, nobles, these, artifacts, were, often, used, as, burial, goods, and, played, a, role, in, sacrificial, practices, due, to, its, aquatic, origins, shells, were, prized, for, their, connection, to, the, sea, and, role, in, water, and, fertility, rituals, used, as, offerings, in, agricultural, fields, to, promote, abundant, crop, yields, the, chim, also, placed, shells, in, sources, of, water, such, as, wells, and, springs, to, bring, rain, to, their, fields, especially, in, times, of, drought, the, symbolic, significance, of, the, spondylus, shell, is, closely, related, to, the, physical, attributes, and, biological, properties, of, the, bivalve, its, characteristic, morphology, contributed, to, the, association, of, the, shell, with, divine, power, and, the, supernatural, world, the, external, spines, of, spondylus, lend, to, the, shell, its, ties, to, strength, and, protection, because, of, its, shape, and, red, blood, like, color, the, shell, often, represents, death, sacrifice, and, ritual, bloodletting, practices, as, well, as, female, reproductive, body, parts, known, as, the, daughter, of, the, sea, the, spondylus, shell, has, also, been, linked, to, femininity, with, the, univalve, embodying, masculinity, spondylus, has, specialized, sensory, organs, in, particular, sensitive, eyes, and, papillae, that, andean, cultures, associate, with, extra, sensory, protection, sensitive, to, temperature, changes, in, water, and, thriving, in, warmer, waters, the, shell, was, thought, to, have, divinatory, powers, and, because, its, migratory, patterns, are, related, to, el, ni, o, conditions, its, presence, is, seen, as, an, omen, for, disaster, moreover, spondylus, exhibits, seasonal, toxicity, known, as, paralytic, shellfish, poisoning, psp, twice, a, year, the, mollusk, tissue, contains, substances, that, are, toxic, to, humans, caused, by, poisonous, algae, that, the, mollusks, consume, during, these, months, the, shells, are, offered, to, weather, and, fertility, deities, as, food, for, the, gods, as, it, was, thought, that, only, deities, were, powerful, enough, to, eat, the, flesh, of, the, bivalve, at, tolerable, levels, human, consumption, of, this, toxic, flesh, may, result, in, muscle, weakness, mind, altering, states, and, euphoria, but, in, more, concentrated, doses, may, lead, to, paralysis, and, death, because, of, these, hallucinogenic, effects, spondylus, was, a, symbol, of, spiritual, transcendence, and, was, viewed, as, bridge, between, physical, and, supernatural, worlds, though, the, remains, of, shell, workshops, and, artifacts, are, abundant, in, chimor, the, spondylus, shell, originates, in, the, warm, waters, of, ecuador, harvesting, the, shell, is, both, a, time, and, labor, intensive, process, requiring, experienced, divers, to, free, dive, to, depths, of, up, to, 50, meters, and, pry, the, shells, off, of, rocks, the, difficult, task, of, shell, diving, is, captured, in, the, imagery, of, many, portable, andean, artifacts, such, as, bowls, earspools, and, textiles, many, of, these, images, are, similar, illustrating, a, boat, with, sailors, holding, cords, attached, to, the, divers, in, the, water, stone, weights, are, suspended, from, the, divers, as, they, gather, shells, and, portrayals, of, spondylus, often, emphasize, their, characteristic, spines, the, image, to, the, right, features, a, chim, earspool, which, was, molded, from, gold, copper, and, silver, alloys, and, depicts, a, shell, diving, scene, the, rectangle, in, the, upper, half, of, the, earspool, is, a, boat, with, large, sails, and, birds, reside, at, the, top, of, the, piece, four, divers, swim, beneath, the, boat, and, are, near, spiky, eggshell, shaped, shells, sections, of, ciudadelas, large, compounds, often, reserved, for, the, kings, and, elite, individuals, were, used, as, storage, areas, for, shell, artifacts, and, the, architecture, and, ornamentation, of, these, structures, symbolize, the, treasures, of, the, sea, los, buceadores, the, divers, a, relief, in, chan, chan, in, ciudadela, uhle, displays, imagery, of, a, pair, of, figures, in, a, tule, boat, one, of, whom, holds, a, paddle, and, another, pair, of, shell, divers, beneath, the, boat, and, connected, to, ropes, the, relief, also, features, a, net, like, semicircle, as, well, as, spiny, figures, that, represent, shells, much, of, the, existing, evidence, for, shell, working, in, the, andes, stems, from, archaeological, findings, and, colonial, texts, spondylus, is, abundant, in, sites, across, peru, discovered, in, burial, sites, and, with, the, remains, of, shell, workshops, the, high, level, of, uniformity, in, these, shell, objects, combined, with, the, technical, nature, of, shell, working, indicate, that, spondylus, production, was, domestic, and, carried, out, by, independent, craftsmen, many, collections, of, spondylus, artifacts, contain, objects, from, various, stages, of, shell, production, whole, shells, fragments, worked, pieces, and, debris, from, shell, reduction, though, researchers, have, uncovered, worked, shell, debris, and, ample, proof, for, the, presence, of, shell, workshops, they, have, only, identified, and, discussed, very, few, specific, shell, workshops, one, workshop, which, was, thought, to, be, maintained, by, the, chim, people, was, identified, at, t, cume, in, the, lambayeque, region, of, peru, by, archaeologist, and, researcher, daniel, sandweiss, dating, back, to, around, 1390, 1480, a, d, the, workshop, comprised, various, small, rooms, and, contained, evidence, for, the, production, of, spondylus, beads, shell, debris, from, all, stages, of, production, ranging, from, cut, pieces, to, finished, beads, along, with, the, stone, tools, used, to, work, the, shell, were, excavated, from, the, site, while, many, archaeological, sources, point, to, the, abundance, of, shell, working, as, the, remains, of, shell, workshops, and, artifacts, were, uncovered, widely, in, peru, little, evidence, documents, the, movement, of, spondylus, from, its, source, in, ecuador, to, workshops, in, chan, chan, the, archaeological, record, indicates, that, chimor, was, an, important, center, for, the, exchange, of, trade, and, shell, often, traveled, long, distances, from, its, geographic, source, to, reach, the, empire, of, chimor, the, trade, of, spondylus, was, integral, to, the, expanding, political, power, and, economy, of, the, chim, the, shell, was, viewed, as, an, exotic, material, and, the, chimor, control, of, the, exchange, of, the, imported, luxury, good, served, as, a, means, of, political, control, establishing, and, legitimizing, the, rule, of, the, nobles, unlike, the, inca, empire, the, chim, did, not, attempt, to, expand, its, command, of, the, spondylus, trade, through, imperial, conquests, of, neighboring, states, but, rather, used, its, existing, access, to, the, trade, as, a, religious, and, financial, justification, for, power, little, information, exists, about, the, means, by, which, spondylus, was, acquired, and, exchanged, along, trade, routes, and, many, scholars, have, proposed, various, models, for, spondylus, movement, the, marine, bivalve, was, likely, traded, either, through, independent, merchants, or, state, administered, long, distance, trade, with, a, north, south, movement, of, the, items, one, of, the, first, accounts, of, exchange, of, spondylus, is, a, report, written, by, spanish, colonist, francisco, xerez, who, was, a, member, of, the, expedition, led, by, francisco, pizarro, and, describes, a, raft, of, luxury, goods, such, as, textiles, emeralds, and, gold, and, silver, objects, which, were, to, be, traded, for, spondylus, shells, researchers, likewise, disagree, on, the, transportation, methods, of, shells, and, whether, they, were, exported, via, sea, or, land, imagery, in, andean, pottery, and, reliefs, depict, llama, caravans, carrying, shell, providing, evidence, that, the, transportation, of, shell, was, at, least, in, part, overland, spinning, is, the, practice, of, combining, a, small, set, of, threads, to, achieve, a, long, and, continuous, thread, with, the, use, of, an, instrument, called, a, spindle, the, zone, is, an, instrument, made, of, a, small, wand, that, usually, gets, thinner, at, both, ends, that, was, used, alongside, a, tortera, or, piruro, the, spindle, is, inserted, into, the, bottom, to, make, a, counterweight, it, starts, spinning, taking, the, rueca, where, the, fiber, was, set, to, be, spun, fibers, that, are, laid, down, in, the, zone, are, quickly, turned, between, the, thumb, and, index, fingers, and, twisted, to, interlock, the, fibers, creating, a, long, thread, after, the, desired, lengths, of, threads, are, attained, the, threads, are, intersected, and, woven, in, various, combinations, to, make, fabrics, the, chim, embellished, their, fabrics, with, brocades, embroidery, fabrics, doubles, and, painted, fabrics, sometimes, textiles, were, adorned, with, feathers, and, gold, or, silver, plates, tropical, feathers, used, in, such, textiles, are, evidence, of, long, distance, trade, colored, dyes, were, created, from, plants, containing, tannin, mole, or, walnut, and, minerals, such, as, clay, ferruginosa, or, mordant, aluminum, as, well, as, from, animals, such, as, cochineal, the, garments, were, made, of, the, wool, of, four, animals, the, guanaco, llama, alpaca, and, vicuna, the, people, also, used, varieties, of, cotton, that, grows, naturally, in, seven, different, colors, the, clothing, consisted, of, the, chim, loincloth, sleeveless, shirts, with, or, without, fringes, small, ponchos, and, tunics, the, majority, of, chim, textiles, were, made, from, alpaca, wool, and, cotton, judging, from, the, uniform, spin, direction, degree, of, the, twist, and, colors, of, the, threads, it, is, likely, that, all, of, the, fibers, were, pre, spun, and, imported, from, a, single, location, the, civilization, is, known, for, its, exquisite, and, intricate, metalworking, one, of, the, most, advanced, of, the, pre, columbian, era, chim, ceramics, were, crafted, for, two, functions, containers, for, daily, domestic, use, and, those, made, for, ceremonial, use, for, offerings, at, burials, domestic, pottery, was, developed, without, higher, finishing, while, funeral, ceramics, show, more, aesthetic, refinement, the, main, features, of, chim, ceramics, were, small, sculptures, and, manufacturing, molded, and, shaped, pottery, for, ceremonial, or, daily, use, ceramics, were, usually, stained, black, although, there, are, some, variations, lighter, ceramics, were, also, produced, in, smaller, quantities, the, characteristic, brightness, was, obtained, by, rubbing, with, a, rock, that, previously, had, been, polished, many, animals, fruits, characters, and, mystical, entities, have, been, represented, pictorially, on, chim, ceramics, archaeological, evidence, suggest, that, chimor, grew, out, of, the, remnants, of, the, moche, as, early, chim, pottery, had, some, resemblance, to, that, of, the, moche, their, ceramics, are, all, black, and, their, work, in, precious, metals, is, very, detailed, and, intricate, metalworking, picked, up, quickly, in, the, late, chim, periods, the, chim, worked, with, metals, such, as, gold, silver, and, copper, some, chim, artisans, worked, in, metal, workshops, divided, into, sections, for, each, specialized, treatment, of, metals, plating, gold, stamping, lost, wax, pearl, the, watermark, and, embossing, wooden, molds, these, techniques, produced, large, variety, of, objects, such, as, cups, knives, containers, figurines, bracelets, pins, and, crowns, they, used, arsenic, to, harden, the, metals, after, they, were, cast, large, scale, smelting, took, place, in, a, cluster, of, workshops, at, cerro, de, los, cemetarios, the, process, starts, with, ore, extracted, from, mines, or, a, river, which, is, heated, to, very, high, temperatures, and, then, cooled, the, result, is, a, group, of, prills, such, as, small, round, sections, of, copper, in, a, mass, of, slag, which, are, other, materials, which, are, not, useful, for, metallurgy, the, prills, are, then, extracted, by, crushing, the, slag, and, then, melted, together, to, form, ingots, which, were, fashioned, into, various, items, the, chim, also, shaped, metals, through, hammering, as, displayed, in, the, image, on, the, right, of, the, silver, chim, beaker, chim, metalsmiths, achieved, this, technique, with, simple, tools, and, a, single, sheet, of, gold, the, artist, would, first, carve, a, wooden, mold, then, they, would, carefully, hammer, the, paper, thin, sheet, of, gold, around, the, wooden, base, although, copper, is, found, naturally, on, the, coast, it, was, mostly, attained, from, the, highlands, in, an, area, about, 3, days, away, since, most, of, the, copper, was, imported, it, is, likely, that, most, of, the, metal, objects, that, were, made, were, likely, very, small, the, pieces, such, as, wires, needles, digging, stick, points, tweezers, and, personal, ornaments, are, consistently, small, utilitarian, objects, of, copper, or, copper, bronze, the, tumi, is, one, well, known, chim, work, they, also, made, beautiful, ritual, costumes, of, gold, compounds, with, plume, headdresses, earrings, necklaces, bracelets, and, breastplates, in, pacasmayo, the, moon, deity, si, or, shi, was, the, greatest, divinity, it, was, believed, to, be, more, powerful, than, the, sun, as, it, appeared, by, night, and, day, and, it, also, controlled, the, weather, and, growth, of, crops, devotees, sacrificed, animals, and, birds, to, the, moon, as, well, as, their, own, children, on, piles, of, colored, cottons, with, offerings, of, fruit, and, chicha, they, believed, the, sacrificed, children, would, become, deified, and, they, were, usually, sacrificed, around, age, five, the, chim, worshipped, mars, nor, and, earth, ghisa, deities, as, well, as, the, sun, jiang, and, the, sea, ni, deities, jiang, was, associated, with, stones, called, alaec, pong, cacique, stone, which, were, believed, to, be, ancestors, of, the, people, in, whose, area, they, stood, and, sons, of, the, sun, the, chim, made, offerings, of, maize, flour, of, red, ochre, to, ni, for, protection, against, drowning, and, bountiful, catches, of, fish, several, constellations, were, also, viewed, as, important, two, of, the, stars, of, orion, s, belt, were, considered, to, be, the, emissaries, of, the, moon, the, constellation, fur, the, pleiades, was, used, to, calculate, the, year, and, was, believed, to, watch, over, the, crops, each, district, had, local, shrines, that, varied, in, importance, these, shrines, called, huacas, were, also, found, in, other, parts, of, peru, and, had, a, sacred, object, of, worship, macyaec, with, an, associated, legend, and, cult, in, 1997, members, of, an, archaeological, team, discovered, approximately, 200, skeletal, remains, on, the, beach, at, punta, lobos, peru, these, figures, were, blindfolded, and, had, their, hands, bound, behind, their, backs, their, feet, bound, together, and, their, throats, slashed, archaeologists, suggest, these, figures, likely, bodies, of, fishermen, may, have, been, killed, as, a, sign, of, gratitude, to, the, sea, god, ni, after, they, conquered, the, fishermen, s, fertile, seaside, valley, in, 1350, a, d, tombs, in, the, huaca, of, the, moon, belonged, to, six, or, seven, teenagers, from, 13, 14, years, of, age, nine, tombs, belonged, to, children, in, 2011, archaeologists, uncovered, human, and, animal, skeletons, in, the, village, of, huanchaco, after, years, of, excavation, they, identified, more, than, 140, human, and, more, than, 200, llama, skeletons, from, children, between, the, ages, of, 6, and, 15, all, of, whom, had, deep, slashes, across, the, sternum, and, broken, rib, cages, indicating, that, their, hearts, may, have, been, removed, according, to, national, geographic, if, the, analysis, is, correct, the, discovery, constitutes, the, largest, single, mass, child, sacrifice, event, known, in, world, history, the, burial, is, dated, at, 1400, 1450, a, d, anthropologist, haagen, klaus, speculates, that, chim, might, have, turned, to, children, when, the, sacrifice, of, adults, was, not, enough, to, stop, torrential, rain, and, flooding, caused, by, el, ni, o, in, august, 2019, the, archaeological, team, working, at, this, site, revealed, that, the, bodies, of, 227, victims, aged, between, four, and, 14, had, been, excavated, further, establishing, this, as, the, largest, ever, known, example, of, child, sacrifice, differential, architecture, of, palaces, and, monumental, sites, distinguished, the, rulers, from, the, common, people, at, chan, chan, there, are, ten, large, walled, enclosures, called, ciudadelas, or, royal, compounds, thought, to, be, associated, with, the, kings, of, chimor, they, are, surrounded, by, adobe, walls, that, are, nine, meters, high, giving, the, ciudadela, the, appearance, of, a, fortress, the, bulk, of, the, chim, population, approximately, 26, 000, people, lived, in, barrios, on, the, outer, edge, of, the, city, they, consisted, of, many, single, family, domestic, spaces, with, a, kitchen, work, space, domestic, animals, and, storage, area, ciudadelas, frequently, have, u, shaped, rooms, that, consist, of, three, walls, a, raised, floor, and, frequently, a, courtyard, and, there, were, often, as, many, as, 15, in, one, palace, in, the, early, chim, period, the, u, shaped, areas, were, found, in, strategic, places, for, controlling, the, flow, of, supplies, from, storerooms, but, it, is, unlikely, that, they, served, as, storage, areas, they, are, described, as, mnemonic, devices, for, keeping, track, of, the, distribution, of, supplies, over, time, the, frequency, of, the, u, shaped, structures, increased, and, the, distribution, of, the, structures, changed, becoming, more, grouped, rather, than, dispersed, and, occurring, further, away, from, access, routes, to, resources, the, architecture, of, the, rural, sites, also, supported, the, idea, of, a, hierarchical, social, order, they, have, similar, structural, components, making, them, mini, ciudadelas, with, rural, adapted, administrative, functions, most, of, these, sites, have, smaller, walls, with, many, audiencias, as, the, focal, point, of, the, structures, these, would, be, used, to, restrict, access, to, certain, areas, and, are, often, found, at, strategic, points, chan, chan, shows, a, lack, of, a, unifying, plan, or, a, discernible, pattern, the, urban, core, contains, six, principal, classes, of, architecture
