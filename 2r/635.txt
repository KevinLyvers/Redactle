the, history, of, film, chronicles, the, development, of, a, visual, art, form, created, using, film, technologies, that, began, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, advent, of, film, as, an, artistic, medium, is, not, clearly, defined, there, were, earlier, cinematographic, screenings, by, others, however, the, commercial, public, screening, of, ten, lumi, re, brothers, short, films, in, paris, on, 28, december, 1895, can, be, regarded, as, the, breakthrough, of, projected, cinematographic, motion, pictures, the, earliest, films, were, in, black, and, white, under, a, minute, long, without, recorded, sound, and, consisted, of, a, single, shot, from, a, steady, camera, the, first, decade, saw, film, move, from, a, novelty, to, an, established, mass, entertainment, industry, with, film, production, companies, and, studios, established, throughout, the, world, conventions, toward, a, general, cinematic, language, developed, with, film, editing, camera, movements, and, other, cinematic, techniques, contributing, specific, roles, in, the, narrative, of, films, popular, new, media, including, television, mainstream, since, the, 1950s, home, video, 1980s, and, the, internet, 1990s, influenced, the, distribution, and, consumption, of, films, film, production, usually, responded, with, content, to, fit, the, new, media, and, technical, innovations, including, widescreen, 1950s, 3d, and, 4d, film, and, more, spectacular, films, to, keep, theatrical, screenings, attractive, systems, that, were, cheaper, and, more, easily, handled, including, 8mm, film, video, and, smartphone, cameras, allowed, for, an, increasing, number, of, people, to, create, films, of, varying, qualities, for, any, purpose, including, home, movies, and, video, art, the, technical, quality, was, usually, lower, than, professional, movies, but, improved, with, digital, video, and, affordable, high, quality, digital, cameras, improving, over, time, digital, production, methods, became, more, popular, during, the, 1990s, resulting, in, increasingly, realistic, visual, effects, and, popular, feature, length, computer, animations, various, film, genres, have, emerged, during, the, history, of, film, and, enjoyed, variable, degrees, of, success, the, use, of, film, as, an, art, form, traces, its, origins, to, several, earlier, traditions, in, the, arts, such, as, oral, storytelling, literature, theatre, and, visual, arts, cantastoria, and, similar, ancient, traditions, combined, storytelling, with, series, of, images, that, were, shown, or, indicated, one, after, the, other, predecessors, to, film, that, had, already, used, light, and, shadows, to, create, art, before, the, advent, of, modern, film, technology, include, shadowgraphy, shadow, puppetry, camera, obscura, and, the, magic, lantern, shadowgraphy, and, shadow, puppetry, represent, early, examples, of, the, intent, to, use, moving, imagery, for, entertainment, and, storytelling, thought, to, have, originated, in, the, far, east, the, art, form, used, shadows, cast, by, hands, or, objects, to, assist, in, the, creation, of, narratives, shadow, puppetry, enjoyed, popularity, for, centuries, around, asia, notably, in, java, and, eventually, spread, to, europe, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, by, the, 16th, century, entertainers, often, conjured, images, of, ghostly, apparitions, using, techniques, such, as, camera, obscura, and, other, forms, of, projection, to, enhance, their, performances, magic, lantern, shows, developed, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 17th, century, seem, to, have, continued, this, tradition, with, images, of, death, monsters, and, other, scary, figures, around, 1790, this, practice, was, developed, into, a, type, of, multimedia, ghost, show, known, as, phantasmagoria, these, popular, shows, entertained, audiences, using, mechanical, slides, rear, projection, mobile, projectors, superimposition, dissolves, live, actors, smoke, on, which, projections, may, have, been, cast, odors, sounds, and, even, electric, shocks, while, many, first, magic, lantern, shows, were, intended, to, frighten, viewers, advances, by, projectionists, allowed, for, creative, and, even, educational, storytelling, that, could, appeal, to, wider, family, audiences, newly, pioneered, techniques, such, as, the, use, of, dissolving, views, and, the, chromatrope, allowed, for, smoother, transitions, between, two, projected, images, and, aided, in, providing, stronger, narratives, in, 1833, scientific, study, of, a, stroboscopic, illusion, in, spoked, wheels, by, joseph, plateau, michael, faraday, and, simon, stampfer, led, to, the, invention, of, the, fantascope, also, known, as, the, stroboscopic, disk, or, the, phenakistiscope, which, was, popular, in, several, european, countries, for, a, while, plateau, thought, it, could, be, further, developed, for, use, in, phantasmagoria, and, stampfer, imagined, a, system, for, longer, scenes, with, strips, on, rollers, as, well, as, a, transparent, version, probably, intended, for, projection, plateau, charles, wheatstone, antoine, claudet, and, others, tried, to, combine, the, technique, with, the, stereoscope, introduced, in, 1838, and, photography, introduced, in, 1839, for, a, more, complete, illusion, of, reality, but, for, decades, such, experiments, were, mostly, hindered, by, the, need, for, long, exposure, times, with, motion, blur, around, objects, that, moved, while, the, reflected, light, fell, on, the, photo, sensitive, chemicals, a, few, people, managed, to, get, decent, results, from, stop, motion, techniques, but, these, were, only, very, rarely, marketed, and, no, form, of, animated, photography, had, much, cultural, impact, before, the, advent, of, chronophotography, most, early, photographic, sequences, known, as, chronophotography, were, not, initially, intended, to, be, viewed, in, motion, and, were, typically, presented, as, a, serious, even, scientific, method, of, studying, locomotion, the, sequences, almost, exclusively, involved, humans, or, animals, performing, a, simple, movement, in, front, of, the, camera, starting, in, 1878, with, the, publication, of, the, horse, in, motion, cabinet, cards, photographer, eadweard, muybridge, began, making, hundreds, of, chronophotographic, studies, of, the, motion, of, animals, and, humans, in, real, time, he, was, soon, followed, by, other, chronophotographers, like, tienne, jules, marey, georges, demen, albert, londe, and, ottomar, ansch, tz, in, 1879, muybridge, started, lecturing, on, animal, locomotion, and, used, his, zoopraxiscope, to, project, animations, of, the, contours, of, his, recordings, traced, onto, glass, discs, in, 1887, the, german, inventor, and, photographer, ottomar, ansch, tz, started, presenting, his, chronophotographic, recordings, in, motion, using, a, device, he, called, the, elektrischen, schnellseher, also, known, as, the, electrotachyscope, which, displayed, short, loops, on, a, small, milk, glass, screen, by, 1891, he, had, started, mass, production, of, a, more, economical, coin, operated, peep, box, viewing, device, of, the, same, name, that, was, exhibited, at, international, exhibitions, and, fairs, some, machines, were, installed, for, longer, periods, including, some, at, the, crystal, palace, in, london, and, in, several, u, s, stores, shifting, the, focus, of, the, medium, from, technical, and, scientific, interest, in, motion, to, entertainment, for, the, masses, he, recorded, wrestlers, dancers, acrobats, and, scenes, of, everyday, life, nearly, 34, 000, people, paid, to, see, his, shows, at, the, berlin, exhibition, park, in, summer, 1892, others, saw, it, in, london, or, at, the, 1893, chicago, world, s, fair, though, little, evidence, remains, for, most, of, these, recordings, some, scenes, probably, depicted, staged, comical, sequences, extant, records, suggest, some, of, his, output, directly, influenced, later, works, by, the, edison, company, such, as, the, 1894, film, fred, ott, s, sneeze, advances, towards, motion, picture, projection, technologies, were, based, on, the, popularity, of, magic, lanterns, chronophotographic, demonstrations, and, other, closely, related, forms, of, projected, entertainment, such, as, illustrated, songs, from, october, 1892, to, march, 1900, inventor, mile, reynaud, exhibited, his, th, tre, optique, optical, theatre, film, system, at, the, mus, e, gr, vin, in, paris, reynaud, s, device, which, projected, a, series, of, animated, stories, such, as, pauvre, pierrot, and, autour, d, une, cabine, was, displayed, to, over, 500, 000, visitors, over, the, course, of, 12, 800, shows, on, 25, 29, and, 30, november, 1894, ottomar, ansch, tz, projected, moving, images, from, electrotachyscope, discs, on, a, large, screen, in, the, darkened, grand, auditorium, of, a, post, office, building, in, berlin, from, 22, february, to, 30, march, 1895, a, commercial, 1, 5, hour, program, of, 40, different, scenes, was, screened, for, audiences, of, 300, people, at, the, old, reichstag, and, received, circa, 4, 000, visitors, throughout, the, late, 19th, century, several, inventors, such, as, wordsworth, donisthorpe, louis, le, prince, william, friese, greene, and, the, skladanowsky, brothers, made, pioneering, contributions, to, the, development, of, devices, that, could, capture, and, display, moving, images, laying, the, groundwork, for, the, emergence, of, cinema, as, an, artistic, medium, the, scenes, in, these, experiments, primarily, served, to, demonstrate, the, technology, itself, and, were, usually, filmed, with, family, friends, or, passing, traffic, as, the, moving, subjects, the, earliest, surviving, film, known, today, as, the, roundhay, garden, scene, 1888, was, captured, by, louis, le, prince, and, briefly, depicted, members, of, his, family, in, motion, in, june, 1889, american, inventor, thomas, edison, assigned, a, lab, assistant, william, kennedy, dickson, to, help, develop, a, device, that, could, produce, visuals, to, accompany, the, sounds, produced, from, the, phonograph, building, upon, previous, machines, by, muybridge, marey, ansch, tz, and, others, dickson, and, his, team, created, the, kinetoscope, peep, box, viewer, with, celluloid, loops, containing, about, half, a, minute, of, motion, picture, entertainment, after, an, early, preview, on, 20, may, 1891, edison, introduced, the, machine, in, 1893, many, of, the, movies, presented, on, the, kinetoscope, showcased, well, known, vaudeville, acts, performing, in, edison, s, black, maria, studio, the, kinetoscope, quickly, became, a, global, sensation, with, multiple, viewing, parlors, across, major, cities, by, 1895, as, the, initial, novelty, of, the, images, wore, off, the, edison, company, was, slow, to, diversify, their, repertoire, of, films, and, waning, public, interest, caused, business, to, slow, by, spring, 1895, to, remedy, declining, profits, experiments, such, as, the, dickson, experimental, sound, film, were, conducted, in, an, attempt, to, achieve, the, device, s, original, goal, of, providing, visual, accompaniment, for, sound, recordings, limitations, in, syncing, the, sound, to, the, visuals, however, prevented, widespread, application, during, that, same, period, inventors, began, advancing, technologies, towards, film, projection, that, would, eventually, overtake, edison, s, peep, box, format, the, skladanowsky, brothers, used, their, self, made, bioscop, to, display, the, first, moving, picture, show, to, a, paying, audience, on, 1, november, 1895, in, berlin, but, they, did, not, have, the, quality, or, financial, resources, to, acquire, momentum, most, of, these, films, never, passed, the, experimental, stage, and, their, efforts, garnered, little, public, attention, until, after, cinema, had, become, successful, in, the, latter, half, of, 1895, brothers, auguste, and, louis, lumi, re, filmed, a, number, of, short, scenes, with, their, invention, the, cin, matographe, on, 28, december, 1895, the, brothers, gave, their, first, commercial, screening, in, paris, though, evidence, exists, of, demonstrations, of, the, device, to, small, audiences, as, early, as, october, 1895, the, screening, consisted, of, ten, films, and, lasted, roughly, 20, minutes, the, program, consisted, mainly, of, actuality, films, such, as, workers, leaving, the, lumi, re, factory, as, truthful, documents, of, the, world, but, the, show, also, included, the, staged, comedy, l, arroseur, arros, the, most, advanced, demonstration, of, film, projection, thus, far, the, cin, matographe, was, an, instant, success, bringing, in, an, average, of, 2, 500, to, 3, 000, francs, daily, by, the, end, of, january, 1896, following, the, first, screening, the, order, and, selection, of, films, were, changed, often, the, lumi, re, brothers, primary, business, interests, were, in, selling, cameras, and, film, equipment, to, exhibitors, not, the, actual, production, of, films, despite, this, filmmakers, across, the, world, were, inspired, by, the, potential, of, film, as, exhibitors, brought, their, shows, to, new, countries, this, era, of, filmmaking, dubbed, by, film, historian, tom, gunning, as, the, cinema, of, attractions, offered, a, relatively, cheap, and, simple, way, of, providing, entertainment, to, the, masses, rather, than, focusing, on, stories, gunning, argues, filmmakers, mainly, relied, on, the, ability, to, delight, audiences, through, the, illusory, power, of, viewing, sequences, in, motion, much, as, they, did, in, the, kinetoscope, era, that, preceded, it, despite, this, early, experimentation, with, fiction, filmmaking, both, in, actuality, film, and, other, genres, did, occur, films, were, mostly, screened, inside, temporary, storefront, spaces, in, tents, of, traveling, exhibitors, at, fairs, or, as, dumb, acts, in, vaudeville, programs, during, this, period, before, the, process, of, post, production, was, clearly, defined, exhibitors, were, allowed, to, exercise, their, creative, freedom, in, their, presentations, to, enhance, the, viewers, experience, some, showings, were, accompanied, by, live, musicians, in, an, orchestra, a, theatre, organ, live, sound, effects, and, commentary, spoken, by, the, showman, or, projectionist, experiments, in, film, editing, special, effects, narrative, construction, and, camera, movement, during, this, period, by, filmmakers, in, france, england, and, the, united, states, became, influential, in, establishing, an, identity, for, film, going, forward, at, both, the, edison, and, lumi, re, studios, loose, narratives, such, as, the, 1895, edison, film, washday, troubles, established, short, relationship, dynamics, and, simple, storylines, in, 1896, la, f, e, aux, choux, the, fairy, of, the, cabbages, was, first, released, directed, and, edited, by, alice, guy, the, story, is, arguably, the, earliest, narrative, film, in, history, as, well, as, the, first, film, to, be, directed, by, a, woman, that, same, year, the, edison, manufacturing, company, released, the, may, irwin, kiss, in, may, to, widespread, financial, success, the, film, which, featured, the, first, kiss, in, cinematic, history, led, to, the, earliest, known, calls, for, film, censorship, another, early, film, producer, was, australia, s, limelight, department, commencing, in, 1898, it, was, operated, by, the, salvation, army, in, melbourne, australia, the, limelight, department, produced, evangelistic, material, for, use, by, the, salvation, army, including, lantern, slides, as, early, as, 1891, as, well, as, private, and, government, contracts, in, its, nineteen, years, of, operation, the, limelight, department, produced, about, 300, films, of, various, lengths, making, it, one, of, largest, film, producers, of, its, time, the, limelight, department, made, a, 1904, film, by, joseph, perry, called, bushranging, in, north, queensland, which, is, believed, to, be, the, first, ever, film, about, bushrangers, in, its, infancy, film, was, rarely, recognized, as, an, art, form, by, presenters, or, audiences, regarded, by, the, upper, class, as, a, vulgar, and, lowbrow, form, of, cheap, entertainment, films, largely, appealed, to, the, working, class, and, were, often, too, short, to, hold, any, strong, narrative, potential, initial, advertisements, promoted, the, technologies, used, to, screen, films, rather, than, the, films, themselves, as, the, devices, became, more, familiar, to, audiences, their, potential, for, capturing, and, recreating, events, was, exploited, primarily, in, the, form, of, newsreels, and, actualities, during, the, creation, of, these, films, cinematographers, often, drew, upon, aesthetic, values, established, by, past, art, forms, such, as, framing, and, the, intentional, placement, of, the, camera, in, the, composition, of, their, image, in, a, 1955, article, for, the, quarterly, of, film, radio, and, television, film, producer, and, historian, kenneth, macgowan, asserted, that, the, intentional, staging, and, recreation, of, events, for, newsreels, brought, storytelling, to, the, screen, with, the, advertisement, of, film, technologies, over, content, actualities, initially, began, as, a, series, of, views, that, often, contained, shots, of, beautiful, and, lively, places, or, performance, acts, following, the, success, of, their, 1895, screening, the, lumi, re, brothers, established, a, company, and, sent, cameramen, across, the, world, to, capture, new, subjects, for, presentation, after, the, cinematographer, shot, scenes, they, often, exhibited, their, recordings, locally, and, then, sent, them, back, to, the, company, factory, in, lyon, to, make, duplicate, prints, for, sale, to, whoever, wanted, them, in, the, process, of, filming, actualities, especially, those, of, real, events, filmmakers, discovered, and, experimented, with, multiple, camera, techniques, to, accommodate, for, their, unpredictable, nature, due, to, the, short, length, often, only, one, shot, of, many, actualities, catalogue, records, indicate, that, production, companies, marketed, to, exhibitors, by, promoting, multiple, actualities, with, related, subject, matters, that, could, be, purchased, to, complement, each, other, exhibitors, who, bought, the, films, often, presented, them, in, a, program, and, would, provide, spoken, accompaniment, to, explain, the, action, on, screen, to, audiences, the, first, paying, audience, for, a, motion, picture, gathered, at, madison, square, garden, to, see, a, staged, actuality, that, purported, itself, to, be, a, boxing, fight, filmed, by, woodville, latham, using, a, device, called, the, eidoloscope, on, may, 20, 1895, commissioned, by, latham, the, french, inventor, eugene, augustin, lauste, created, the, device, with, additional, expertise, from, william, kennedy, dickson, and, crafted, a, mechanism, that, came, to, be, known, as, the, latham, loop, which, allowed, for, longer, continuous, runtimes, and, was, less, abrasive, on, the, celluloid, film, in, subsequent, years, screenings, of, actualities, and, newsreels, proved, to, be, profitable, in, 1897, the, corbett, fitzsimmons, fight, was, released, the, film, was, a, complete, recording, of, a, heavyweight, world, championship, boxing, match, at, carson, city, nevada, it, generated, more, income, in, box, office, than, in, live, gate, receipts, and, was, the, longest, film, produced, at, the, time, audiences, had, probably, been, drawn, to, the, corbett, fitzsimmons, film, en, masse, because, james, j, corbett, a, k, a, gentleman, jim, had, become, a, matinee, idol, since, he, had, played, a, fictionalized, version, of, himself, in, a, stage, play, from, 1910, on, regular, newsreels, were, exhibited, and, soon, became, a, popular, way, of, discovering, the, news, before, the, advent, of, television, the, british, antarctic, expedition, to, the, south, pole, was, filmed, for, the, newsreels, as, were, the, suffragette, demonstrations, that, were, happening, at, the, same, time, f, percy, smith, was, an, early, nature, documentary, pioneer, working, for, charles, urban, when, he, pioneered, the, use, of, time, lapse, and, micro, cinematography, in, his, 1910, documentary, on, the, growth, of, flowers, following, the, successful, exhibition, of, the, cin, matographe, development, of, a, motion, picture, industry, rapidly, accelerated, in, france, multiple, filmmakers, experimented, with, the, technology, as, they, worked, to, attain, the, same, success, that, the, lumi, re, brothers, had, with, their, screening, these, filmmakers, established, new, companies, such, as, the, star, film, company, path, fr, res, and, the, gaumont, film, company, the, most, widely, cited, progenitor, of, narrative, filmmaking, is, the, french, filmmaker, georges, m, li, s, m, li, s, was, an, illusionist, who, had, previously, used, magic, lantern, projections, to, enhance, his, magic, act, in, 1895, m, li, s, attended, the, demonstration, of, the, cinematographe, and, recognized, the, potential, of, the, device, to, aid, his, act, he, attempted, to, buy, a, device, from, the, lumi, re, brothers, but, they, refused, months, later, he, bought, a, camera, from, robert, w, paul, and, began, experiments, with, the, device, by, creating, actualities, during, this, period, of, experimentation, m, li, s, discovered, and, implemented, various, special, effects, including, the, stop, trick, the, multiple, exposure, and, the, use, of, dissolves, in, his, films, at, the, end, of, 1896, m, li, s, established, the, star, film, company, and, started, producing, directing, and, distributing, a, body, of, work, that, would, eventually, contain, over, 500, short, films, recognizing, the, narrative, potential, afforded, by, combining, his, theater, background, with, the, newly, discovered, effects, for, the, camera, m, li, s, designed, an, elaborate, stage, that, contained, trapdoors, and, a, fly, system, the, stage, construction, and, editing, techniques, allowed, for, the, development, of, more, complex, stories, such, as, the, 1896, film, le, manoir, du, diable, the, house, of, the, devil, regarded, as, a, first, in, the, horror, film, genre, and, the, 1899, film, cendrillon, cinderella, in, m, li, s, films, he, based, the, placement, of, the, camera, on, the, theatrical, construct, of, proscenium, framing, the, metaphorical, plane, or, fourth, wall, that, divides, the, actors, and, the, audience, throughout, his, career, m, li, s, consistently, placed, the, camera, in, a, fixed, position, and, eventually, fell, out, of, favor, with, audiences, as, other, filmmakers, experimented, with, more, complex, and, creative, techniques, m, li, s, is, most, widely, known, today, for, his, 1902, film, le, voyage, dans, la, lune, a, trip, to, the, moon, where, he, used, his, expertise, in, effects, and, narrative, construction, to, create, the, first, science, fiction, film, in, 1900, charles, path, began, film, production, under, the, path, fr, res, brand, with, ferdinand, zecca, hired, to, lead, the, creative, process, prior, to, this, focus, on, production, path, had, become, involved, with, the, industry, by, exhibiting, and, selling, what, were, likely, counterfeit, versions, of, the, kinetoscope, in, his, phonograph, shop, with, the, creative, leadership, of, zecca, and, the, capability, to, mass, produce, copies, of, the, films, through, a, partnership, with, a, french, toolmaking, company, charles, path, sought, to, make, path, fr, res, the, leading, film, producer, in, the, country, within, the, next, few, years, path, fr, res, became, the, largest, film, studio, in, the, world, with, satellite, offices, in, major, cities, and, an, expanding, selection, of, films, available, for, presentation, the, company, s, films, were, varied, in, content, with, directors, specializing, in, various, genres, for, fairground, presentations, throughout, the, early, 1900s, the, gaumont, film, company, was, the, main, regional, rival, of, path, fr, res, founded, in, 1895, by, l, on, gaumont, the, firm, initially, sold, photographic, equipment, and, began, film, production, in, 1897, under, the, direction, of, alice, guy, the, industry, s, first, female, director, her, earlier, films, share, many, characteristics, and, themes, with, her, contemporary, competitors, such, as, the, lumi, res, and, m, li, s, she, explored, dance, and, travel, films, often, combining, the, two, such, as, le, bol, ro, performed, by, miss, saharet, 1905, and, tango, 1905, many, of, guy, s, early, dance, films, were, popular, in, music, hall, attractions, such, as, the, serpentine, dance, films, also, a, staple, of, the, lumi, res, and, thomas, edison, film, catalogs, in, 1906, she, made, the, life, of, christ, a, big, budget, production, for, the, time, which, included, 300, extras, german, inventor, and, film, tycoon, oskar, messter, was, an, important, figure, in, the, early, years, of, cinema, his, firm, messter, film, was, one, of, the, dominant, german, producers, before, the, rise, of, ufa, with, which, it, merged, eventually, messter, first, added, a, geneva, drive, on, the, projectors, to, oscillatingly, cause, intermittent, movement, to, advance, the, frames, of, the, film, and, he, set, up, the, first, film, studio, in, germany, in, 1900, from, 1896, messter, was, interested, in, the, search, of, a, method, of, reproduction, and, synchronization, of, the, sound, effects, of, the, cinematographic, performance, at, the, time, of, the, silent, movies, so, messter, invented, the, tonbilder, biophon, to, show, films, in, which, a, gramophone, played, unter, den, linden, accompanying, the, projection, of, animated, images, but, it, was, not, a, simple, add, on, but, to, precisely, match, the, series, of, musical, pieces, with, moving, images, in, effect, to, add, sound, to, the, silent, cinema, it, was, necessary, to, solve, problems, of, synchronization, since, the, image, and, the, sound, were, recorded, and, reproduced, by, separated, devices, which, were, difficult, to, initiate, and, to, maintain, rigged, on, august, 31, 1903, messter, held, the, first, sound, projection, that, took, place, in, germany, at, the, apollo, theater, in, berlin, both, cecil, hepworth, and, robert, w, paul, experimented, with, the, use, of, different, camera, techniques, in, their, films, paul, s, cinematograph, camera, no, 1, of, 1895, was, the, first, camera, to, feature, reverse, cranking, which, allowed, the, same, film, footage, to, be, exposed, several, times, thereby, creating, multiple, exposures, this, technique, was, first, used, in, his, 1901, film, scrooge, or, marley, s, ghost, both, filmmakers, experimented, with, the, speeds, of, the, camera, to, generate, new, effects, paul, shot, scenes, from, on, a, runaway, motor, car, through, piccadilly, circus, 1899, by, cranking, the, camera, apparatus, very, slowly, when, the, film, was, projected, at, the, usual, 16, frames, per, second, the, scenery, appeared, to, be, passing, at, great, speed, hepworth, used, the, opposite, effect, in, the, indian, chief, and, the, seidlitz, powder, 1901, the, chief, s, movements, are, sped, up, by, cranking, the, camera, much, faster, than, 16, frames, per, second, producing, what, modern, audiences, would, call, a, slow, motion, effect, the, first, films, to, move, from, single, shots, to, successive, scenes, began, around, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, due, to, the, loss, of, many, early, films, a, conclusive, shift, from, static, singular, shots, to, a, series, of, scenes, can, be, hard, to, determine, despite, these, limitations, michael, brooke, of, the, british, film, institute, attributes, real, film, continuity, involving, action, moving, from, one, sequence, into, another, to, robert, w, paul, s, 1898, film, come, along, do, only, a, still, from, the, second, shot, remains, extant, today, released, in, 1901, the, british, film, attack, on, a, china, mission, was, one, of, the, first, films, to, show, a, continuity, of, action, across, multiple, scenes, the, use, of, the, intertitle, to, explain, actions, and, dialogue, on, screen, began, in, the, early, 1900s, filmed, intertitles, were, first, used, in, robert, w, paul, s, film, scrooge, or, marley, s, ghost, in, most, countries, intertitles, gradually, came, to, be, used, to, provide, dialogue, and, narration, for, the, film, thus, dispensing, the, need, for, narration, provided, by, exhibitors, development, of, continuous, action, across, multiple, shots, was, furthered, in, england, by, a, loosely, associated, group, of, film, pioneers, collectively, termed, the, brighton, school, these, filmmakers, included, george, albert, smith, and, james, williamson, among, others, smith, and, williamson, experimented, with, action, continuity, and, were, likely, the, first, to, incorporate, the, use, of, inserts, and, close, ups, between, shots, a, basic, technique, for, trick, cinematography, was, the, double, exposure, of, the, film, in, the, camera, the, effect, was, pioneered, by, smith, in, the, 1898, film, photographing, a, ghost, according, to, smith, s, catalogue, records, the, now, lost, film, chronicles, a, photographer, s, struggle, to, capture, a, ghost, on, camera, using, the, double, exposure, of, the, film, smith, overlaid, a, transparent, ghostly, figure, onto, the, background, in, a, comical, manner, to, taunt, the, photographer, smith, s, the, corsican, brothers, was, described, in, the, catalogue, of, the, warwick, trading, company, in, 1900, by, extremely, careful, photography, the, ghost, appears, quite, transparent, after, indicating, that, he, has, been, killed, by, a, sword, thrust, and, appealing, for, vengeance, he, disappears, a, vision, then, appears, showing, the, fatal, duel, in, the, snow, smith, also, initiated, the, special, effects, technique, of, reverse, motion, he, did, this, by, repeating, the, action, a, second, time, while, filming, it, with, an, inverted, camera, and, then, joining, the, tail, of, the, second, negative, to, that, of, the, first, the, first, films, made, using, this, device, were, tipsy, topsy, turvy, and, the, awkward, sign, painter, the, earliest, surviving, example, of, this, technique, is, smith, s, the, house, that, jack, built, made, before, september, 1900, cecil, hepworth, took, this, technique, further, by, printing, the, negatives, of, the, forward, motion, in, reverse, frame, by, frame, producing, a, print, in, which, the, original, action, was, exactly, reversed, to, do, this, he, built, a, special, printer, in, which, the, negative, running, through, a, projector, was, projected, into, the, gate, of, a, camera, through, a, special, lens, giving, a, same, size, image, this, arrangement, came, to, be, called, a, projection, printer, and, eventually, an, optical, printer, in, 1898, george, albert, smith, experimented, with, close, ups, filming, shots, of, a, man, drinking, beer, and, a, woman, using, sniffing, tobacco, the, following, year, smith, made, the, kiss, in, the, tunnel, a, sequence, consisting, of, three, shots, a, train, enters, a, tunnel, a, man, and, a, woman, exchange, a, brief, kiss, in, the, darkness, and, then, return, to, their, seats, the, train, exits, the, tunnel, smith, created, the, scenario, in, response, to, the, success, of, a, genre, known, as, a, phantom, ride, in, a, phantom, ride, film, cameras, would, capture, the, motion, and, surroundings, from, the, front, of, a, moving, train, the, separate, shots, when, edited, together, formed, a, distinct, sequence, of, events, and, established, causality, from, one, shot, to, the, next, following, the, kiss, in, the, tunnel, smith, more, definitively, experimented, with, continuity, of, action, across, successive, shots, and, began, using, inserts, in, his, films, such, as, grandma, s, reading, glass, and, mary, jane, s, mishap, in, 1900, smith, made, as, seen, through, a, telescope, the, main, shot, shows, a, street, scene, with, a, young, man, tying, the, shoelace, and, then, caressing, the, foot, of, his, girlfriend, while, an, old, man, observes, this, through, a, telescope, there, is, then, a, cut, to, close, shot, of, the, hands, on, the, girl, s, foot, shown, inside, a, black, circular, mask, and, then, a, cut, back, to, the, continuation, of, the, original, scene, james, williamson, perfected, narrative, building, techniques, in, his, 1900, film, attack, on, a, china, mission, the, film, which, film, historian, john, barnes, later, described, as, having, the, most, fully, developed, narrative, of, any, film, made, in, england, up, to, that, time, opens, as, the, first, shot, shows, chinese, boxer, rebels, at, the, gate, it, then, cuts, to, the, missionary, family, in, the, garden, where, a, fight, ensues, the, wife, signals, to, british, sailors, from, the, balcony, who, come, and, rescue, them, the, film, also, used, the, first, reverse, angle, cut, in, film, history, the, following, year, williamson, created, the, big, swallow, in, the, film, a, man, becomes, irritated, by, the, presence, of, the, filmmaker, and, swallows, the, camera, and, its, operator, through, the, use, of, interpolated, close, up, shots, he, combined, these, effects, along, with, superimpositions, use, of, wipe, transitions, to, denote, a, scene, change, and, other, techniques, to, create, a, film, language, or, film, grammar, james, williamson, s, use, of, continuous, action, in, his, 1901, film, stop, thief, stimulated, a, film, genre, known, as, the, chase, film, in, the, film, a, tramp, steals, a, leg, of, mutton, from, a, butcher, s, boy, in, the, first, shot, is, chased, by, the, butcher, s, boy, and, assorted, dogs, in, the, following, shot, and, is, finally, caught, by, the, dogs, in, the, third, shot, the, execution, of, mary, stuart, produced, in, 1895, by, the, edison, company, for, viewing, with, the, kinetoscope, showed, mary, queen, of, scots, being, executed, in, full, view, of, the, camera, the, effect, known, as, the, stop, trick, was, achieved, by, replacing, the, actor, with, a, dummy, for, the, final, shot, the, technique, used, in, the, film, is, seen, as, one, of, the, earliest, known, uses, of, special, effects, in, film, the, american, filmmaker, edwin, s, porter, started, making, films, for, the, edison, company, in, 1901, a, former, projectionist, hired, by, thomas, edison, to, develop, his, new, projection, model, known, as, the, vitascope, porter, was, inspired, in, part, by, the, works, of, m, li, s, smith, and, williamson, and, drew, upon, their, newly, crafted, techniques, to, further, the, development, of, continuous, narrative, through, editing, when, he, began, making, longer, films, in, 1902, he, put, a, dissolve, between, every, shot, just, as, georges, m, li, s, was, already, doing, and, he, frequently, had, the, same, action, repeated, across, the, dissolves, in, 1902, porter, shot, life, of, an, american, fireman, for, the, edison, manufacturing, company, and, distributed, the, film, the, following, year, in, the, film, porter, combined, stock, footage, from, previous, edison, films, with, newly, shot, footage, and, spliced, them, together, to, convey, a, dramatic, story, of, the, rescue, of, a, woman, and, her, child, by, heroic, firemen, porter, s, film, the, great, train, robbery, 1903, had, a, running, time, of, twelve, minutes, with, twenty, separate, shots, and, ten, different, indoor, and, outdoor, locations, the, film, is, seen, as, a, first, in, the, western, film, genre, and, is, significant, for, the, use, of, shots, suggesting, simultaneous, action, occurring, at, different, locations, porter, s, use, of, both, staged, and, real, outdoor, environments, helped, to, create, a, sense, of, space, while, the, placement, of, the, camera, in, a, wider, shot, established, depth, and, allowed, for, an, extended, duration, of, motion, on, screen, the, great, train, robbery, served, as, one, of, the, vehicles, that, would, launch, the, film, medium, into, mass, popularity, that, same, year, the, miles, brothers, opened, the, first, film, exchange, in, the, country, which, allowed, permanent, exhibitors, to, rent, films, from, the, company, at, a, lower, cost, than, the, producers, that, sold, their, films, outright, john, p, harris, opened, the, first, permanent, theater, devoted, exclusively, to, the, presentation, of, films, the, nickelodeon, in, 1905, in, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, the, idea, rapidly, took, off, and, by, 1908, there, were, around, 8, 000, nickelodeon, theaters, across, the, country, with, the, arrival, of, the, nickelodeon, audience, demand, for, a, larger, quantity, of, story, films, with, a, variety, of, subjects, and, locations, led, to, a, need, to, hire, more, creative, talent, and, caused, studios, to, invest, in, more, elaborate, stage, designs, in, 1908, thomas, edison, spearheaded, the, creation, of, a, corporate, trust, between, the, major, film, companies, in, america, known, as, the, motion, picture, patents, company, mppc, to, limit, infringement, on, his, patents, members, of, the, trust, controlled, every, aspect, of, the, filmmaking, process, from, the, creation, of, film, stock, the, production, of, films, and, the, distribution, to, cinemas, through, licensing, arrangements, the, trust, led, to, increased, quality, filmmaking, spurred, by, internal, competition, and, placed, limits, on, the, amount, of, foreign, films, to, encourage, the, growth, of, the, american, film, industry, but, it, also, discouraged, the, creation, of, feature, films, by, 1915, the, mppc, had, lost, most, of, its, hold, on, the, film, industry, as, the, companies, moved, towards, the, wider, production, of, feature, films, with, the, worldwide, film, boom, more, countries, now, joined, britain, france, germany, and, the, united, states, in, serious, film, production, in, italy, production, was, spread, over, several, centers, turin, was, the, first, major, film, production, centre, and, milan, and, naples, gave, birth, to, the, first, film, magazines, in, turin, ambrosio, was, the, first, company, in, the, field, in, 1905, and, remained, the, largest, in, the, country, through, this, period, its, most, substantial, rival, was, cines, in, rome, which, started, producing, in, 1906, the, great, strength, of, the, italian, industry, was, historical, epics, with, large, casts, and, massive, scenery, as, early, as, 1911, giovanni, pastrone, s, two, reel, la, caduta, di, troia, the, fall, of, troy, made, a, big, impression, worldwide, and, it, was, followed, by, even, bigger, productions, like, quo, vadis, 1912, which, ran, for, 90, minutes, and, pastrone, s, cabiria, of, 1914, which, ran, for, two, and, a, half, hours, italian, companies, also, had, a, strong, line, in, slapstick, comedy, with, actors, like, andr, deed, known, locally, as, cretinetti, and, elsewhere, as, foolshead, and, gribouille, achieving, worldwide, fame, with, his, almost, surrealistic, gags, the, most, important, film, producing, country, in, northern, europe, up, until, the, first, world, war, was, denmark, the, nordisk, company, was, set, up, there, in, 1906, by, ole, olsen, a, fairground, showman, and, after, a, brief, period, imitating, the, successes, of, french, and, british, filmmakers, in, 1907, he, produced, 67, films, most, directed, by, viggo, larsen, with, sensational, subjects, like, den, hvide, slavinde, the, white, slave, isbj, rnejagt, polar, bear, hunt, and, l, vejagten, the, lion, hunt, by, 1910, new, smaller, danish, companies, began, joining, the, business, and, besides, making, more, films, about, the, white, slave, trade, they, contributed, other, new, subjects, the, most, important, of, these, finds, was, asta, nielsen, in, afgrunden, the, abyss, directed, by, urban, gad, for, kosmorama, this, combined, the, circus, sex, jealousy, and, murder, all, put, over, with, great, conviction, and, pushed, the, other, danish, filmmakers, further, in, this, direction, by, 1912, the, danish, film, companies, were, multiplying, rapidly, the, swedish, film, industry, was, smaller, and, slower, to, get, started, than, the, danish, industry, here, charles, magnusson, a, newsreel, cameraman, for, the, svenskabiografteatern, cinema, chain, started, fiction, film, production, for, them, in, 1909, directing, a, number, of, the, films, himself, production, increased, in, 1912, when, the, company, engaged, victor, sj, str, m, and, mauritz, stiller, as, directors, they, started, out, by, imitating, the, subjects, favoured, by, the, danish, film, industry, but, by, 1913, they, were, producing, their, own, strikingly, original, work, which, sold, very, well, russia, began, its, film, industry, in, 1908, with, path, shooting, some, fiction, subjects, there, and, then, the, creation, of, real, russian, film, companies, by, aleksandr, drankov, and, aleksandr, khanzhonkov, the, khanzhonkov, company, quickly, became, much, the, largest, russian, film, company, and, remained, so, until, 1918, in, germany, oskar, messter, had, been, involved, in, film, making, from, 1896, but, did, not, make, a, significant, number, of, films, per, year, until, 1910, when, the, worldwide, film, boom, started, he, and, the, few, other, people, in, the, german, film, business, continued, to, sell, prints, of, their, own, films, outright, which, put, them, at, a, disadvantage, it, was, only, when, paul, davidson, the, owner, of, a, chain, of, cinemas, brought, asta, nielsen, and, urban, gad, to, germany, from, denmark, in, 1911, and, set, up, a, production, company, projektions, ag, union, pagu, that, a, change, over, to, renting, prints, began, messter, replied, with, a, series, of, longer, films, starring, henny, porten, but, although, these, did, well, in, the, german, speaking, world, they, were, not, particularly, successful, internationally, unlike, the, asta, nielsen, films, another, of, the, growing, german, film, producers, just, before, world, war, i, was, the, german, branch, of, the, french, clair, company, deutsche, clair, this, was, expropriated, by, the, german, government, and, turned, into, decla, when, the, war, started, but, altogether, german, producers, only, had, a, minor, part, of, the, german, market, in, 1914, overall, from, about, 1910, american, films, had, the, largest, share, of, the, market, in, all, european, countries, except, france, and, even, in, france, the, american, films, had, just, pushed, the, local, production, out, of, first, place, on, the, eve, of, world, war, i, path, fr, res, expanded, and, significantly, shaped, the, american, film, business, creating, many, firsts, in, the, film, industry, such, as, adding, titles, and, subtitles, to, films, for, the, first, time, releasing, scrolls, for, the, first, time, introducing, film, posters, for, the, first, time, producing, color, pictures, for, the, first, time, taking, out, commercial, bills, for, the, first, time, contacting, exhibitors, and, studying, their, needs, for, the, first, time, the, world, s, largest, film, supplier, path, is, limited, to, the, u, s, market, which, has, reached, a, saturation, level, so, the, u, s, seeks, additional, profits, from, foreign, markets, movies, are, defined, as, pure, american, phenomenon, in, the, united, states, new, film, techniques, that, were, introduced, in, this, period, include, the, use, of, artificial, lighting, fire, effects, and, low, key, lighting, i, e, lighting, in, which, most, of, the, frame, is, dark, for, enhanced, atmosphere, during, sinister, scenes, continuity, of, action, from, shot, to, shot, was, also, refined, such, as, in, path, s, le, cheval, emball, the, runaway, horse, 1907, where, cross, cutting, between, parallel, actions, is, used, d, w, griffith, also, began, using, cross, cutting, in, the, film, the, fatal, hour, made, in, july, 1908, another, development, was, the, use, of, the, point, of, view, shot, first, used, in, 1910, in, vitagraph, s, back, to, nature, insert, shots, were, also, used, for, artistic, purposes, the, italian, film, la, mala, planta, the, evil, plant, directed, by, mario, caserini, had, an, insert, shot, of, a, snake, slithering, over, the, evil, plant, by, 1914, it, was, widely, held, in, the, american, film, industry, that, cross, cutting, was, most, generally, useful, because, it, made, possible, the, elimination, of, uninteresting, parts, of, the, action, that, play, no, part, in, advancing, the, drama, in, 1909, 35mm, became, the, internationally, recognized, theatrical, film, gauge, as, films, grew, longer, specialist, writers, were, employed, to, simplify, more, complex, stories, derived, from, novels, or, plays, into, a, form, that, could, be, contained, on, one, reel, genres, began, to, be, used, as, categories, the, main, division, was, into, comedy, and, drama, but, these, categories, were, further, subdivided, intertitles, containing, lines, of, dialogue, began, to, be, used, consistently, from, 1908, onwards, such, as, in, vitagraph, s, an, auto, heroine, or, the, race, for, the, vitagraph, cup, and, how, it, was, won, the, dialogue, was, eventually, inserted, into, the, middle, of, the, scene, and, became, commonplace, by, 1912, the, introduction, of, dialogue, titles, transformed, the, nature, of, film, narrative, when, dialogue, titles, came, to, be, always, cut, into, a, scene, just, after, a, character, starts, speaking, and, then, left, with, a, cut, to, the, character, just, before, they, finish, speaking, then, one, had, something, that, was, effectively, the, equivalent, of, a, present, day, sound, film, the, years, of, the, first, world, war, were, a, complex, transitional, period, for, the, film, industry, the, exhibition, of, films, changed, from, short, one, reel, programmes, to, feature, films, exhibition, venues, became, larger, and, began, charging, higher, prices, in, the, united, states, these, changes, brought, destruction, to, many, film, companies, the, vitagraph, company, being, an, exception, film, production, began, to, shift, to, los, angeles, during, world, war, i, the, universal, film, manufacturing, company, was, formed, in, 1912, as, an, umbrella, company, new, entrants, included, the, jesse, lasky, feature, play, company, and, famous, players, both, formed, in, 1913, and, later, amalgamated, into, famous, players, lasky, the, biggest, success, of, these, years, was, david, wark, griffith, s, the, birth, of, a, nation, 1915, griffith, followed, this, up, with, the, even, bigger, intolerance, 1916, but, due, to, the, high, quality, of, film, produced, in, the, us, the, market, for, their, films, was, high, in, france, film, production, shut, down, due, to, the, general, military, mobilization, of, the, country, at, the, start, of, the, war, although, film, production, began, again, in, 1915, it, was, on, a, reduced, scale, and, the, biggest, companies, gradually, retired, from, production, italian, film, production, held, up, better, although, so, called, diva, films, starring, anguished, female, leads, were, a, commercial, failure, in, denmark, the, nordisk, company, increased, its, production, so, much, in, 1915, and, 1916, that, it, could, not, sell, all, its, films, which, led, to, a, very, sharp, decline, in, danish, production, and, the, end, of, denmark, s, importance, on, the, world, film, scene, the, german, film, industry, was, seriously, weakened, by, the, war, the, most, important, of, the, new, film, producers, at, the, time, was, joe, may, who, made, a, series, of, thrillers, and, adventure, films, through, the, war, years, but, ernst, lubitsch, also, came, into, prominence, with, a, series, of, very, successful, comedies, and, dramas, at, this, time, studios, were, blacked, out, to, allow, shooting, to, be, unaffected, by, changing, sunlight, this, was, replaced, with, floodlights, and, spotlights, the, widespread, adoption, of, irising, in, and, out, to, begin, and, end, scenes, caught, on, in, this, period, this, is, the, revelation, of, a, film, shot, in, a, circular, mask, which, gradually, gets, larger, until, it, expands, beyond, the, frame, other, shaped, slits, were, used, including, vertical, and, diagonal, apertures, a, new, idea, taken, over, from, still, photography, was, soft, focus, this, began, in, 1915, with, some, shots, being, intentionally, thrown, out, of, focus, for, expressive, effect, as, in, mary, pickford, starrer, fanchon, the, cricket, it, was, during, this, period, that, camera, effects, intended, to, convey, the, subjective, feelings, of, characters, in, a, film, really, began, to, be, established, these, could, now, be, done, as, point, of, view, pov, shots, as, in, sidney, drew, s, the, story, of, the, glove, 1915, where, a, wobbly, hand, held, shot, of, a, door, and, its, keyhole, represents, the, pov, of, a, drunken, man, the, use, of, anamorphic, in, the, general, sense, of, distorted, shape, images, first, appears, in, these, years, when, abel, gance, directed, la, folie, du, docteur, tube, the, madness, of, dr, tube, in, this, film, the, effect, of, a, drug, administered, to, a, group, of, people, was, suggested, by, shooting, the, scenes, reflected, in, a, distorting, mirror, of, the, fair, ground, type, symbolic, effects, taken, over, from, conventional, literary, and, artistic, tradition, continued, to, make, some, appearances, in, films, during, these, years, in, d, w, griffith, s, the, avenging, conscience, 1914, the, title, the, birth, of, the, evil, thought, precedes, a, series, of, three, shots, of, the, protagonist, looking, at, a, spider, and, ants, eating, an, insect, symbolist, art, and, literature, from, the, turn, of, the, century, also, had, a, more, general, effect, on, a, small, number, of, films, made, in, italy, and, russia, the, supine, acceptance, of, death, resulting, from, passion, and, forbidden, longings, was, a, major, feature, of, this, art, and, states, of, delirium, dwelt, on, at, length, were, important, as, well, the, use, of, insert, shots, i, e, close, ups, of, objects, other, than, faces, had, already, been, established, by, the, brighton, school, but, were, infrequently, used, before, 1914, it, is, really, only, with, griffith, s, the, avenging, conscience, that, a, new, phase, in, the, use, of, the, insert, shot, starts, as, well, as, the, symbolic, inserts, already, mentioned, the, film, also, made, extensive, use, of, large, numbers, of, big, close, up, shots, of, clutching, hands, and, tapping, feet, as, a, means, of, emphasizing, those, parts, of, the, body, as, indicators, of, psychological, tension, atmospheric, inserts, were, developed, in, europe, in, the, late, 1910s, this, kind, of, shot, is, one, in, a, scene, which, neither,

different, angles, within, a, scene, also, became, well, established, as, a, technique, for, dissecting, a, scene, into, shots, in, american, films, if, the, direction, of, the, shot, changes, by, more, than, ninety, degrees, it, is, called, a, reverse, angle, cutting, the, leading, figure, in, the, full, development, of, reverse, angle, cutting, was, ralph, ince, in, his, films, such, as, the, right, girl, and, his, phantom, sweetheart, the, use, of, flash, back, structures, continued, to, develop, in, this, period, with, the, usual, way, of, entering, and, leaving, a, flash, back, being,

more, so, in, american, films, than, in, european, ones, cross, cutting, was, used, to, get, new, effects, of, contrast, such, as, the, cross, cut, sequence, in, cecil, b, demille, s, the, whispering, chorus, 1918, in, which, a, supposedly, dead, husband, is, having, a, liaison, with, a, chinese, prostitute, in, an, opium, den, while, simultaneously, his, unknowing, wife, is, being, remarried, in,

the, general, trend, in, the, development, of, cinema, led, from, the, united, states, was, towards, using, the, newly, developed, specifically, filmic, devices, for, expression, of, the, narrative, content, of, film, stories, and, combining, this, with, the, standard, dramatic, structures, already, in, use, in, commercial, theatre, d, w, griffith, had, the, highest, standing, among, american,

ranked, for, the, pictorial, beauties, of, his, films, together, with, the, subtlety, of, his, handling, of, fantasy, while, at, the, same, time, he, was, capable, of, getting, greater, naturalism, from, his, actors, at, appropriate, moments, as, in, a, girl, s, folly, 1917, sidney, drew, was, the, leader, in, developing, polite, comedy, while, slapstick, was, refined, by, fatty, arbuckle, and,

the, subtlety, and, finesse, of, their, movement, and, the, cleverness, of, their, gags, by, 1917, chaplin, was, also, introducing, more, dramatic, plot, into, his, films, and, mixing, the, comedy,

contained, what, is, generally, regarded, as, the, first, synchronized, dialogue, and, singing, in, a, feature, film, but, this, process, was, actually, accomplished, first, by, charles, taze, russell, in, 1914, with, the, lengthy, film, the, photo, drama, of, creation, this, drama, consisted, of, picture, slides, and, moving, pictures, synchronized, with, phonograph, records, of, talks, and, music, the, early, sound, on, disc, processes, such, as, vitaphone, were, soon, superseded, by, sound, on, film, methods, like, fox, movietone, deforest, phonofilm, and, rca, photophone, the,

further, tightened, the, grip, of, major, studios, in, numerous, countries, the, vast, expense, of, the, transition, overwhelmed, smaller, competitors, while, the, novelty, of, sound, lured, vastly,

the, late, 1940s, the, american, cinema, reached, its, peak, of, efficiently, manufactured, glamour, and, global, appeal, during, this, period, the, top, actors, of, the, era, are, now, thought, of,

stagey, talkies, as, artists, in, front, of, and, behind, the, camera, struggled, with, the, stringent, limitations, of, the, early, sound, equipment, and, their, own, uncertainty, as, to, how, to, use, the, new, medium, many, stage, performers, directors, and, writers, were, introduced, to, cinema, as, producers, sought, personnel, experienced, in, dialogue, based, storytelling, many, major,

of, individual, actors, also, contributed, to, the, decline, of, traditional, hollywood, studio, production, there, was, also, an, increasing, awareness, of, foreign, language, cinema, in, america, during, this, period, during, the, late, 1950s, and, 1960s, the, french, new, wave, directors, such, as, fran, ois, truffaut, and, jean, luc, godard, produced, films, such, as, les, quatre, cents,

politically, engaged, third, cinema, in, contrast, to, hollywood, and, the, european, auteur, cinema, in, egypt, the, golden, age, of, egyptian, cinema, continued, in, the, 1960s, at, the, hands, of,

were, on, a, date, with, many, productions, including, ezz, el, dine, zulfikar, s, the, river, of, love, 1960, mahmoud, zulfikar, s, soft, hands, 1964, and, dearer, than, my, life, 1965, starring,

the, threat, of, an, apocalyptic, nuclear, exchange, like, the, 1962, close, call, with, the, ussr, during, the, cuban, missile, crisis, prompted, a, reaction, within, the, film, community, as, well, films, like, stanley, kubrick, s, dr, strangelove, and, fail, safe, with, henry, fonda, were, produced, in, a, hollywood, that, was, once, known, for, its, overt, patriotism, and, wartime, propaganda, in, documentary, film, the, sixties, saw, the, blossoming, of, direct, cinema, an, observational, style, of, film, making, as, well, as, the, advent, of, more, overtly, partisan, films, like, in, the, year, of, the, pig, about, the, vietnam, war, by, emile, de, antonio, by, the, late, 1960s, however, hollywood, filmmakers, were, beginning, to, create, more, innovative, and, ground, breaking, films, that, reflected, the, social, revolution, taken, over, much, of, the, western, world, such, as, bonnie, and, clyde, 1967, the, graduate, 1967, 2001, a, space, odyssey, 1968, rosemary, s, baby, 1968, midnight, cowboy, 1969, easy, rider, 1969, and, the, wild, bunch, 1969, bonnie, and, clyde, is, often, considered, the, beginning, of, the, so, called, new, hollywood, in, japanese, cinema, academy, award, winning, director, akira, kurosawa, produced, yojimbo, 1961, which, like, his, previous, films, also, had, a, profound, influence, around, the, world, the, influence, of, this, film, is, most, apparent, in, sergio, leone, s, a, fistful, of, dollars, 1964, and, walter, hill, s, last, man, standing, 1996, yojimbo, was, also, the, origin, of, the, man, with, no, name, trend, the, new, hollywood, was, the, period, following, the, decline, of, the, studio, system, during, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, and, the, end, of, the, production, code, which, was, replaced, in, 1968, by, the, mpaa, film, rating, system, during, the, 1970s, filmmakers, increasingly, depicted, explicit, sexual, content, and, showed, gunfight, and, battle, scenes, that, included, graphic, images, of, bloody, deaths, a, notable, example, of, this, is, wes, craven, s, the, last, house, on, the, left, 1972, post, classical, cinema, is, the, changing, methods, of, storytelling, of, the, new, hollywood, producers, the, new, methods, of, drama, and, characterization, played, upon, audience, expectations, acquired, during, the, classical, golden, age, period, story, chronology, may, be, scrambled, storylines, may, feature, unsettling, twist, endings, main, characters, may, behave, in, a, morally, ambiguous, fashion, and, the, lines, between, the, antagonist, and, protagonist, may, be, blurred, the, beginnings, of, post, classical, storytelling, may, be, seen, in, 1940s, and, 1950s, film, noir, films, in, films, such, as, rebel, without, a, cause, 1955, and, in, hitchcock, s, psycho, 1971, marked, the, release, of, controversial, films, like, straw, dogs, a, clockwork, orange, the, french, connection, and, dirty, harry, this, sparked, heated, controversy, over, the, perceived, escalation, of, violence, in, cinema, during, the, 1970s, a, new, group, of, american, filmmakers, emerged, such, as, martin, scorsese, francis, ford, coppola, george, lucas, woody, allen, terrence, malick, and, robert, altman, this, coincided, with, the, increasing, popularity, of, the, auteur, theory, in, film, literature, and, the, media, which, posited, that, a, film, director, s, films, express, their, personal, vision, and, creative, insights, the, development, of, the, auteur, style, of, filmmaking, helped, to, give, these, directors, far, greater, control, over, their, projects, than, would, have, been, possible, in, earlier, eras, this, led, to, some, great, critical, and, commercial, successes, like, scorsese, s, taxi, driver, coppola, s, the, godfather, films, william, friedkin, s, the, exorcist, altman, s, nashville, allen, s, annie, hall, and, manhattan, malick, s, badlands, and, days, of, heaven, and, polish, immigrant, roman, polanski, s, chinatown, it, also, however, resulted, in, some, failures, including, peter, bogdanovich, s, at, long, last, love, and, michael, cimino, s, hugely, expensive, western, epic, heaven, s, gate, which, helped, to, bring, about, the, demise, of, its, backer, united, artists, the, financial, disaster, of, heaven, s, gate, marked, the, end, of, the, visionary, auteur, directors, of, the, new, hollywood, who, had, unrestrained, creative, and, financial, freedom, to, develop, films, the, phenomenal, success, in, the, 1970s, of, spielberg, s, jaws, originated, the, concept, of, the, modern, blockbuster, however, the, enormous, success, of, george, lucas, 1977, film, star, wars, led, to, much, more, than, just, the, popularization, of, blockbuster, filmmaking, the, film, s, revolutionary, use, of, special, effects, sound, editing, and, music, had, led, it, to, become, widely, regarded, as, one, of, the, single, most, important, films, in, the, medium, s, history, as, well, as, the, most, influential, film, of, the, 1970s, hollywood, studios, increasingly, focused, on, producing, a, smaller, number, of, very, large, budget, films, with, massive, marketing, and, promotional, campaigns, this, trend, had, already, been, foreshadowed, by, the, commercial, success, of, disaster, films, such, as, the, poseidon, adventure, and, the, towering, inferno, during, the, mid, 1970s, more, pornographic, theatres, euphemistically, called, adult, cinemas, were, established, and, the, legal, production, of, hardcore, pornographic, films, began, porn, films, such, as, deep, throat, and, its, star, linda, lovelace, became, something, of, a, popular, culture, phenomenon, and, resulted, in, a, spate, of, similar, sex, films, the, porn, cinemas, finally, died, out, during, the, 1980s, when, the, popularization, of, the, home, vcr, and, pornography, videotapes, allowed, audiences, to, watch, sex, films, at, home, in, the, early, 1970s, english, language, audiences, became, more, aware, of, the, new, west, german, cinema, with, werner, herzog, rainer, werner, fassbinder, and, wim, wenders, among, its, leading, exponents, in, world, cinema, the, 1970s, saw, a, dramatic, increase, in, the, popularity, of, martial, arts, films, largely, due, to, its, reinvention, by, bruce, lee, who, departed, from, the, artistic, style, of, traditional, chinese, martial, arts, films, and, added, a, much, greater, sense, of, realism, to, them, with, his, jeet, kune, do, style, this, began, with, the, big, boss, 1971, which, was, a, major, success, across, asia, however, he, did, not, gain, fame, in, the, western, world, until, shortly, after, his, death, in, 1973, when, enter, the, dragon, was, released, the, film, went, on, to, become, the, most, successful, martial, arts, film, in, cinematic, history, popularized, the, martial, arts, film, genre, across, the, world, and, cemented, bruce, lee, s, status, as, a, cultural, icon, hong, kong, action, cinema, however, was, in, decline, due, to, a, wave, of, bruceploitation, films, this, trend, eventually, came, to, an, end, in, 1978, with, the, martial, arts, comedy, films, snake, in, the, eagle, s, shadow, and, drunken, master, directed, by, yuen, woo, ping, and, starring, jackie, chan, laying, the, foundations, for, the, rise, of, hong, kong, action, cinema, in, the, 1980s, while, the, musical, film, genre, had, declined, in, hollywood, by, this, time, musical, films, were, quickly, gaining, popularity, in, the, cinema, of, india, where, the, term, bollywood, was, coined, for, the, growing, hindi, film, industry, in, bombay, now, mumbai, that, ended, up, dominating, south, asian, cinema, overtaking, the, more, critically, acclaimed, bengali, film, industry, in, popularity, hindi, filmmakers, combined, the, hollywood, musical, formula, with, the, conventions, of, ancient, indian, theatre, to, create, a, new, film, genre, called, masala, which, dominated, indian, cinema, throughout, the, late, 20th, century, these, masala, films, portrayed, action, comedy, drama, romance, and, melodrama, all, at, once, with, filmi, song, and, dance, routines, thrown, in, this, trend, began, with, films, directed, by, manmohan, desai, and, starring, amitabh, bachchan, who, remains, one, of, the, most, popular, film, stars, in, south, asia, the, most, popular, indian, film, of, all, time, was, sholay, 1975, a, masala, film, inspired, by, a, real, life, dacoit, as, well, as, kurosawa, s, seven, samurai, and, the, spaghetti, westerns, the, end, of, the, decade, saw, the, first, major, international, marketing, of, australian, cinema, as, peter, weir, s, films, picnic, at, hanging, rock, and, the, last, wave, and, fred, schepisi, s, the, chant, of, jimmie, blacksmith, gained, critical, acclaim, in, 1979, australian, filmmaker, george, miller, also, garnered, international, attention, for, his, violent, low, budget, action, film, mad, max, during, the, 1980s, audiences, began, increasingly, watching, films, on, their, home, vcrs, in, the, early, part, of, that, decade, the, film, studios, tried, legal, action, to, ban, home, ownership, of, vcrs, as, a, violation, of, copyright, which, proved, unsuccessful, eventually, the, sale, and, rental, of, films, on, home, video, became, a, significant, second, venue, for, exhibition, of, films, and, an, additional, source, of, revenue, for, the, film, industries, direct, to, video, niche, markets, usually, offered, lower, quality, cheap, productions, that, were, not, deemed, very, suitable, for, the, general, audiences, of, television, and, theatrical, releases, the, lucas, spielberg, combine, would, dominate, hollywood, cinema, for, much, of, the, 1980s, and, lead, to, much, imitation, two, follow, ups, to, star, wars, three, to, jaws, and, three, indiana, jones, films, helped, to, make, sequels, of, successful, films, more, of, an, expectation, than, ever, before, lucas, also, launched, thx, ltd, a, division, of, lucasfilm, in, 1982, while, spielberg, enjoyed, one, of, the, decade, s, greatest, successes, in, e, t, the, extra, terrestrial, the, same, year, 1982, also, saw, the, release, of, disney, s, tron, which, was, one, of, the, first, films, from, a, major, studio, to, use, computer, graphics, extensively, american, independent, cinema, struggled, more, during, the, decade, although, martin, scorsese, s, raging, bull, 1980, after, hours, 1985, and, the, king, of, comedy, 1983, helped, to, establish, him, as, one, of, the, most, critically, acclaimed, american, film, makers, of, the, era, also, during, 1983, scarface, was, released, which, was, very, profitable, and, resulted, in, even, greater, fame, for, its, leading, actor, al, pacino, tim, burton, s, 1989, version, of, bob, kane, s, creation, batman, saw, jack, nicholson, s, portrayal, of, the, demented, joker, which, earned, him, 60, 90m, after, including, his, percentage, of, the, gross, british, cinema, was, given, a, boost, during, the, early, 1980s, by, the, arrival, of, david, puttnam, s, company, goldcrest, films, the, films, chariots, of, fire, gandhi, the, killing, fields, and, a, room, with, a, view, appealed, to, a, middlebrow, audience, which, was, increasingly, being, ignored, by, the, major, hollywood, studios, while, the, films, of, the, 1970s, had, helped, to, define, modern, blockbuster, motion, pictures, the, way, hollywood, released, its, films, would, now, change, films, for, the, most, part, would, premiere, in, a, wider, number, of, theatres, although, to, this, day, some, films, still, premiere, using, the, route, of, the, limited, roadshow, release, system, against, some, expectations, the, rise, of, the, multiplex, cinema, did, not, allow, less, mainstream, films, to, be, shown, but, simply, allowed, the, major, blockbusters, to, be, given, an, even, greater, number, of, screenings, however, films, that, had, been, overlooked, in, cinemas, were, increasingly, being, given, a, second, chance, on, home, video, during, the, 1980s, japanese, cinema, experienced, a, revival, largely, due, to, the, success, of, anime, films, at, the, beginning, of, the, 1980s, space, battleship, yamato, 1973, and, mobile, suit, gundam, 1979, both, of, which, were, unsuccessful, as, television, series, were, remade, as, films, and, became, hugely, successful, in, japan, in, particular, mobile, suit, gundam, sparked, the, gundam, franchise, of, real, robot, mecha, anime, the, success, of, macross, do, you, remember, love, also, sparked, a, macross, franchise, of, mecha, anime, this, was, also, the, decade, when, studio, ghibli, was, founded, the, studio, produced, hayao, miyazaki, s, first, fantasy, films, nausica, of, the, valley, of, the, wind, 1984, and, castle,

hong, kong, action, cinema, which, was, in, a, state, of, decline, due, to, endless, bruceploitation, films, after, the, death, of, bruce, lee, also, experienced, a, revival, in, the, 1980s, largely, due, to, the, reinvention, of, the, action, film, genre, by, jackie, chan, he, had, previously, combined, the, comedy, film, and, martial, arts, film, genres, successfully, in, the, 1978, films, snake, in, the, eagle, s, shadow, and, drunken, master, the, next, step, he, took, was, in, combining, this, comedy, martial, arts, genre, with, a, new, emphasis, on, elaborate, and, highly, dangerous, stunts, reminiscent, of, the, silent, film, era, the, first, film, in, this, new, style, of, action, cinema, was, project, a, 1983, which, saw, the, formation, of, the, jackie, chan, stunt, team, as, well, as, the, three, brothers, chan, sammo, hung, and, yuen, biao, the, film, added, elaborate, dangerous, stunts, to, the, fights, and, slapstick, humor, and, became, a, huge, success, throughout, the, far, east, as, a, result, chan, continued, this, trend, with, martial, arts, action, films, containing, even, more, elaborate, and, dangerous, stunts, including, wheels, on, meals,
