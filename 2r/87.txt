ancient, egypt, was, a, civilization, of, ancient, northeast, africa, it, was, concentrated, along, the, lower, reaches, of, the, nile, river, situated, within, the, contemporary, territory, of, modern, day, egypt, ancient, egyptian, civilization, followed, prehistoric, egypt, and, coalesced, around, 3100, bc, according, to, conventional, egyptian, chronology, with, the, political, unification, of, upper, and, lower, egypt, under, menes, often, identified, with, narmer, the, history, of, ancient, egypt, unfolded, as, a, series, of, stable, kingdoms, interspersed, by, periods, of, relative, instability, known, as, intermediate, periods, the, various, kingdoms, fall, into, one, of, three, categories, the, old, kingdom, of, the, early, bronze, age, the, middle, kingdom, of, the, middle, bronze, age, or, the, new, kingdom, of, the, late, bronze, age, ancient, egypt, reached, the, pinnacle, of, its, power, during, the, new, kingdom, ruling, much, of, nubia, and, a, sizable, portion, of, the, levant, after, this, period, it, entered, an, era, of, slow, decline, during, the, course, of, its, history, ancient, egypt, was, invaded, or, conquered, by, a, number, of, foreign, powers, including, the, hyksos, the, nubians, the, assyrians, the, achaemenid, persians, and, the, macedonians, under, alexander, the, great, the, greek, ptolemaic, kingdom, formed, in, the, aftermath, of, alexander, s, death, ruled, until, 30, bc, when, under, cleopatra, it, fell, to, the, roman, empire, and, became, a, roman, province, egypt, remained, under, roman, control, until, the, 640s, ad, when, it, was, conquered, by, the, rashidun, caliphate, the, success, of, ancient, egyptian, civilization, came, partly, from, its, ability, to, adapt, to, the, conditions, of, the, nile, river, valley, for, agriculture, the, predictable, flooding, and, controlled, irrigation, of, the, fertile, valley, produced, surplus, crops, which, supported, a, more, dense, population, and, social, development, and, culture, with, resources, to, spare, the, administration, sponsored, mineral, exploitation, of, the, valley, and, surrounding, desert, regions, the, early, development, of, an, independent, writing, system, the, organization, of, collective, construction, and, agricultural, projects, trade, with, surrounding, regions, and, a, military, intended, to, assert, egyptian, dominance, motivating, and, organizing, these, activities, was, a, bureaucracy, of, elite, scribes, religious, leaders, and, administrators, under, the, control, of, a, pharaoh, who, ensured, the, cooperation, and, unity, of, the, egyptian, people, in, the, context, of, an, elaborate, system, of, religious, beliefs, the, many, achievements, of, the, ancient, egyptians, include, the, quarrying, surveying, and, construction, techniques, that, supported, the, building, of, monumental, pyramids, temples, and, obelisks, a, system, of, mathematics, a, practical, and, effective, system, of, medicine, irrigation, systems, and, agricultural, production, techniques, the, first, known, planked, boats, egyptian, faience, and, glass, technology, new, forms, of, literature, and, the, earliest, known, peace, treaty, made, with, the, hittites, ancient, egypt, has, left, a, lasting, legacy, its, art, and, architecture, were, widely, copied, and, its, antiquities, were, carried, off, to, far, corners, of, the, world, its, monumental, ruins, have, inspired, the, imaginations, of, travelers, and, writers, for, millennia, a, newfound, respect, for, antiquities, and, excavations, in, the, early, modern, period, by, europeans, and, egyptians, has, led, to, the, scientific, investigation, of, egyptian, civilization, and, a, greater, appreciation, of, its, cultural, legacy, the, nile, has, been, the, lifeline, of, its, region, for, much, of, human, history, the, fertile, floodplain, of, the, nile, gave, humans, the, opportunity, to, develop, a, settled, agricultural, economy, and, a, more, sophisticated, centralized, society, that, became, a, cornerstone, in, the, history, of, human, civilization, nomadic, modern, human, hunter, gatherers, began, living, in, the, nile, valley, through, the, end, of, the, middle, pleistocene, some, 120, 000, years, ago, by, the, late, paleolithic, period, the, arid, climate, of, northern, africa, had, become, increasingly, hot, and, dry, forcing, the, populations, of, the, area, to, concentrate, along, the, river, region, in, predynastic, and, early, dynastic, times, the, egyptian, climate, was, much, less, arid, than, it, is, today, large, regions, of, egypt, were, covered, in, treed, savanna, and, traversed, by, herds, of, grazing, ungulates, foliage, and, fauna, were, far, more, prolific, in, all, environs, and, the, nile, region, supported, large, populations, of, waterfowl, hunting, would, have, been, common, for, egyptians, and, this, is, also, the, period, when, many, animals, were, first, domesticated, by, about, 5500, bc, small, tribes, living, in, the, nile, valley, had, developed, into, a, series, of, cultures, demonstrating, firm, control, of, agriculture, and, animal, husbandry, and, identifiable, by, their, pottery, and, personal, items, such, as, combs, bracelets, and, beads, the, largest, of, these, early, cultures, in, upper, southern, egypt, was, the, badarian, culture, which, probably, originated, in, the, western, desert, it, was, known, for, its, high, quality, ceramics, stone, tools, and, its, use, of, copper, the, badari, was, followed, by, the, naqada, culture, the, naqada, i, amratian, the, naqada, ii, gerzeh, and, naqada, iii, semainean, these, brought, a, number, of, technological, improvements, as, early, as, the, naqada, i, period, predynastic, egyptians, imported, obsidian, from, ethiopia, used, to, shape, blades, and, other, objects, from, flakes, mutual, trade, with, the, levant, was, established, during, naqada, ii, c, 3600, 3350, bc, this, period, was, also, the, beginning, of, trade, with, mesopotamia, which, continued, into, the, early, dynastic, period, and, beyond, over, a, period, of, about, 1, 000, years, the, naqada, culture, developed, from, a, few, small, farming, communities, into, a, powerful, civilization, whose, leaders, were, in, complete, control, of, the, people, and, resources, of, the, nile, valley, establishing, a, power, center, at, nekhen, in, greek, hierakonpolis, and, later, at, abydos, naqada, iii, leaders, expanded, their, control, of, egypt, northwards, along, the, nile, they, also, traded, with, nubia, to, the, south, the, oases, of, the, western, desert, to, the, west, and, the, cultures, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, and, near, east, to, the, east, the, naqada, culture, manufactured, a, diverse, selection, of, material, goods, reflective, of, the, increasing, power, and, wealth, of, the, elite, as, well, as, societal, personal, use, items, which, included, combs, small, statuary, painted, pottery, high, quality, decorative, stone, vases, cosmetic, palettes, and, jewelry, made, of, gold, lapis, and, ivory, they, also, developed, a, ceramic, glaze, known, as, faience, which, was, used, well, into, the, roman, period, to, decorate, cups, amulets, and, figurines, during, the, last, predynastic, phase, the, naqada, culture, began, using, written, symbols, that, eventually, were, developed, into, a, full, system, of, hieroglyphs, for, writing, the, ancient, egyptian, language, the, early, dynastic, period, was, approximately, contemporary, to, the, early, sumerian, akkadian, civilization, of, mesopotamia, and, of, ancient, elam, the, third, century, bc, egyptian, priest, manetho, grouped, the, long, line, of, kings, from, menes, to, his, own, time, into, 30, dynasties, a, system, still, used, today, he, began, his, official, history, with, the, king, named, meni, or, menes, in, greek, who, was, believed, to, have, united, the, two, kingdoms, of, upper, and, lower, egypt, the, transition, to, a, unified, state, happened, more, gradually, than, ancient, egyptian, writers, represented, and, there, is, no, contemporary, record, of, menes, some, scholars, now, believe, however, that, the, mythical, menes, may, have, been, the, king, narmer, who, is, depicted, wearing, royal, regalia, on, the, ceremonial, narmer, palette, in, a, symbolic, act, of, unification, in, the, early, dynastic, period, which, began, about, 3000, bc, the, first, of, the, dynastic, kings, solidified, control, over, lower, egypt, by, establishing, a, capital, at, memphis, from, which, he, could, control, the, labor, force, and, agriculture, of, the, fertile, delta, region, as, well, as, the, lucrative, and, critical, trade, routes, to, the, levant, the, increasing, power, and, wealth, of, the, kings, during, the, early, dynastic, period, was, reflected, in, their, elaborate, mastaba, tombs, and, mortuary, cult, structures, at, abydos, which, were, used, to, celebrate, the, deified, king, after, his, death, the, strong, institution, of, kingship, developed, by, the, kings, served, to, legitimize, state, control, over, the, land, labor, and, resources, that, were, essential, to, the, survival, and, growth, of, ancient, egyptian, civilization, major, advances, in, architecture, art, and, technology, were, made, during, the, old, kingdom, fueled, by, the, increased, agricultural, productivity, and, resulting, population, made, possible, by, a, well, developed, central, administration, some, of, ancient, egypt, s, crowning, achievements, the, giza, pyramids, and, great, sphinx, were, constructed, during, the, old, kingdom, under, the, direction, of, the, vizier, state, officials, collected, taxes, coordinated, irrigation, projects, to, improve, crop, yield, drafted, peasants, to, work, on, construction, projects, and, established, a, justice, system, to, maintain, peace, and, order, with, the, rising, importance, of, central, administration, in, egypt, a, new, class, of, educated, scribes, and, officials, arose, who, were, granted, estates, by, the, king, in, payment, for, their, services, kings, also, made, land, grants, to, their, mortuary, cults, and, local, temples, to, ensure, that, these, institutions, had, the, resources, to, worship, the, king, after, his, death, scholars, believe, that, five, centuries, of, these, practices, slowly, eroded, the, economic, vitality, of, egypt, and, that, the, economy, could, no, longer, afford, to, support, a, large, centralized, administration, as, the, power, of, the, kings, diminished, regional, governors, called, nomarchs, began, to, challenge, the, supremacy, of, the, office, of, king, this, coupled, with, severe, droughts, between, 2200, and, 2150, bc, is, believed, to, have, caused, the, country, to, enter, the, 140, year, period, of, famine, and, strife, known, as, the, first, intermediate, period, after, egypt, s, central, government, collapsed, at, the, end, of, the, old, kingdom, the, administration, could, no, longer, support, or, stabilize, the, country, s, economy, regional, governors, could, not, rely, on, the, king, for, help, in, times, of, crisis, and, the, ensuing, food, shortages, and, political, disputes, escalated, into, famines, and, small, scale, civil, wars, yet, despite, difficult, problems, local, leaders, owing, no, tribute, to, the, king, used, their, new, found, independence, to, establish, a, thriving, culture, in, the, provinces, once, in, control, of, their, own, resources, the, provinces, became, economically, richer, which, was, demonstrated, by, larger, and, better, burials, among, all, social, classes, in, bursts, of, creativity, provincial, artisans, adopted, and, adapted, cultural, motifs, formerly, restricted, to, the, royalty, of, the, old, kingdom, and, scribes, developed, literary, styles, that, expressed, the, optimism, and, originality, of, the, period, free, from, their, loyalties, to, the, king, local, rulers, began, competing, with, each, other, for, territorial, control, and, political, power, by, 2160, bc, rulers, in, herakleopolis, controlled, lower, egypt, in, the, north, while, a, rival, clan, based, in, thebes, the, intef, family, took, control, of, upper, egypt, in, the, south, as, the, intefs, grew, in, power, and, expanded, their, control, northward, a, clash, between, the, two, rival, dynasties, became, inevitable, around, 2055, bc, the, northern, theban, forces, under, nebhepetre, mentuhotep, ii, finally, defeated, the, herakleopolitan, rulers, reuniting, the, two, lands, they, inaugurated, a, period, of, economic, and, cultural, renaissance, known, as, the, middle, kingdom, the, kings, of, the, middle, kingdom, restored, the, country, s, stability, and, prosperity, thereby, stimulating, a, resurgence, of, art, literature, and, monumental, building, projects, mentuhotep, ii, and, his, eleventh, dynasty, successors, ruled, from, thebes, but, the, vizier, amenemhat, i, upon, assuming, the, kingship, at, the, beginning, of, the, twelfth, dynasty, around, 1985, bc, shifted, the, kingdom, s, capital, to, the, city, of, itjtawy, located, in, faiyum, from, itjtawy, the, kings, of, the, twelfth, dynasty, undertook, a, far, sighted, land, reclamation, and, irrigation, scheme, to, increase, agricultural, output, in, the, region, moreover, the, military, reconquered, territory, in, nubia, that, was, rich, in, quarries, and, gold, mines, while, laborers, built, a, defensive, structure, in, the, eastern, delta, called, the, walls, of, the, ruler, to, defend, against, foreign, attack, with, the, kings, having, secured, the, country, militarily, and, politically, and, with, vast, agricultural, and, mineral, wealth, at, their, disposal, the, nation, s, population, arts, and, religion, flourished, in, contrast, to, elitist, old, kingdom, attitudes, towards, the, gods, the, middle, kingdom, displayed, an, increase, in, expressions, of, personal, piety, middle, kingdom, literature, featured, sophisticated, themes, and, characters, written, in, a, confident, eloquent, style, the, relief, and, portrait, sculpture, of, the, period, captured, subtle, individual, details, that, reached, new, heights, of, technical, sophistication, the, last, great, ruler, of, the, middle, kingdom, amenemhat, iii, allowed, semitic, speaking, canaanite, settlers, from, the, near, east, into, the, delta, region, to, provide, a, sufficient, labor, force, for, his, especially, active, mining, and, building, campaigns, these, ambitious, building, and, mining, activities, however, combined, with, severe, nile, floods, later, in, his, reign, strained, the, economy, and, precipitated, the, slow, decline, into, the, second, intermediate, period, during, the, later, thirteenth, and, fourteenth, dynasties, during, this, decline, the, canaanite, settlers, began, to, assume, greater, control, of, the, delta, region, eventually, coming, to, power, in, egypt, as, the, hyksos, around, 1785, bc, as, the, power, of, the, middle, kingdom, kings, weakened, a, western, asian, people, called, the, hyksos, who, had, already, settled, in, the, delta, seized, control, of, egypt, and, established, their, capital, at, avaris, forcing, the, former, central, government, to, retreat, to, thebes, the, king, was, treated, as, a, vassal, and, expected, to, pay, tribute, the, hyksos, foreign, rulers, retained, egyptian, models, of, government, and, identified, as, kings, thereby, integrating, egyptian, elements, into, their, culture, they, and, other, invaders, introduced, new, tools, of, warfare, into, egypt, most, notably, the, composite, bow, and, the, horse, drawn, chariot, after, retreating, south, the, native, theban, kings, found, themselves, trapped, between, the, canaanite, hyksos, ruling, the, north, and, the, hyksos, nubian, allies, the, kushites, to, the, south, after, years, of, vassalage, thebes, gathered, enough, strength, to, challenge, the, hyksos, in, a, conflict, that, lasted, more, than, 30, years, until, 1555, bc, the, kings, seqenenre, tao, ii, and, kamose, were, ultimately, able, to, defeat, the, nubians, to, the, south, of, egypt, but, failed, to, defeat, the, hyksos, that, task, fell, to, kamose, s, successor, ahmose, i, who, successfully, waged, a, series, of, campaigns, that, permanently, eradicated, the, hyksos, presence, in, egypt, he, established, a, new, dynasty, and, in, the, new, kingdom, that, followed, the, military, became, a, central, priority, for, the, kings, who, sought, to, expand, egypt, s, borders, and, attempted, to, gain, mastery, of, the, near, east, the, new, kingdom, pharaohs, established, a, period, of, unprecedented, prosperity, by, securing, their, borders, and, strengthening, diplomatic, ties, with, their, neighbours, including, the, mitanni, empire, assyria, and, canaan, military, campaigns, waged, under, tuthmosis, i, and, his, grandson, tuthmosis, iii, extended, the, influence, of, the, pharaohs, to, the, largest, empire, egypt, had, ever, seen, between, their, reigns, hatshepsut, a, queen, who, established, herself, as, pharaoh, launched, many, building, projects, including, the, restoration, of, temples, damaged, by, the, hyksos, and, sent, trading, expeditions, to, punt, and, the, sinai, when, tuthmosis, iii, died, in, 1425, bc, egypt, had, an, empire, extending, from, niya, in, north, west, syria, to, the, fourth, cataract, of, the, nile, in, nubia, cementing, loyalties, and, opening, access, to, critical, imports, such, as, bronze, and, wood, the, new, kingdom, pharaohs, began, a, large, scale, building, campaign, to, promote, the, god, amun, whose, growing, cult, was, based, in, karnak, they, also, constructed, monuments, to, glorify, their, own, achievements, both, real, and, imagined, the, karnak, temple, is, the, largest, egyptian, temple, ever, built, around, 1350, bc, the, stability, of, the, new, kingdom, was, threatened, when, amenhotep, iv, ascended, the, throne, and, instituted, a, series, of, radical, and, chaotic, reforms, changing, his, name, to, akhenaten, he, touted, the, previously, obscure, sun, deity, aten, as, the, supreme, deity, suppressed, the, worship, of, most, other, deities, and, moved, the, capital, to, the, new, city, of, akhetaten, modern, day, amarna, he, was, devoted, to, his, new, religion, and, artistic, style, after, his, death, the, cult, of, the, aten, was, quickly, abandoned, and, the, traditional, religious, order, restored, the, subsequent, pharaohs, tutankhamun, ay, and, horemheb, worked, to, erase, all, mention, of, akhenaten, s, heresy, now, known, as, the, amarna, period, around, 1279, bc, ramesses, ii, also, known, as, ramesses, the, great, ascended, the, throne, and, went, on, to, build, more, temples, erect, more, statues, and, obelisks, and, sire, more, children, than, any, other, pharaoh, in, history, a, bold, military, leader, ramesses, ii, led, his, army, against, the, hittites, in, the, battle, of, kadesh, in, modern, syria, and, after, fighting, to, a, stalemate, finally, agreed, to, the, first, recorded, peace, treaty, around, 1258, bc, egypt, s, wealth, however, made, it, a, tempting, target, for, invasion, particularly, by, the, libyan, berbers, to, the, west, and, the, sea, peoples, a, conjectured, confederation, of, seafarers, from, the, aegean, sea, initially, the, military, was, able, to, repel, these, invasions, but, egypt, eventually, lost, control, of, its, remaining, territories, in, southern, canaan, much, of, it, falling, to, the, assyrians, the, effects, of, external, threats, were, exacerbated, by, internal, problems, such, as, corruption, tomb, robbery, and, civil, unrest, after, regaining, their, power, the, high, priests, at, the, temple, of, amun, in, thebes, accumulated, vast, tracts, of, land, and, wealth, and, their, expanded, power, splintered, the, country, during, the, third, intermediate, period, following, the, death, of, ramesses, xi, in, 1078, bc, smendes, assumed, authority, over, the, northern, part, of, egypt, ruling, from, the, city, of, tanis, the, south, was, effectively, controlled, by, the, high, priests, of, amun, at, thebes, who, recognized, smendes, in, name, only, during, this, time, libyans, had, been, settling, in, the, western, delta, and, chieftains, of, these, settlers, began, increasing, their, autonomy, libyan, princes, took, control, of, the, delta, under, shoshenq, i, in, 945, bc, founding, the, so, called, libyan, or, bubastite, dynasty, that, would, rule, for, some, 200, years, shoshenq, also, gained, control, of, southern, egypt, by, placing, his, family, members, in, important, priestly, positions, libyan, control, began, to, erode, as, a, rival, dynasty, in, the, delta, arose, in, leontopolis, and, kushites, threatened, from, the, south, around, 727, bc, the, kushite, king, piye, invaded, northward, seizing, control, of, thebes, and, eventually, the, delta, which, established, the, 25th, dynasty, during, the, 25th, dynasty, pharaoh, taharqa, created, an, empire, nearly, as, large, as, the, new, kingdom, s, twenty, fifth, dynasty, pharaohs, built, or, restored, temples, and, monuments, throughout, the, nile, valley, including, at, memphis, karnak, kawa, and, jebel, barkal, during, this, period, the, nile, valley, saw, the, first, widespread, construction, of, pyramids, many, in, modern, sudan, since, the, middle, kingdom, egypt, s, far, reaching, prestige, declined, considerably, toward, the, end, of, the, third, intermediate, period, its, foreign, allies, had, fallen, under, the, assyrian, sphere, of, influence, and, by, 700, bc, war, between, the, two, states, became, inevitable, between, 671, and, 667, bc, the, assyrians, began, the, assyrian, conquest, of, egypt, the, reigns, of, both, taharqa, and, his, successor, tanutamun, were, filled, with, constant, conflict, with, the, assyrians, against, whom, egypt, enjoyed, several, victories, ultimately, the, assyrians, pushed, the, kushites, back, into, nubia, occupied, memphis, and, sacked, the, temples, of, thebes, the, assyrians, left, control, of, egypt, to, a, series, of, vassals, who, became, known, as, the, saite, kings, of, the, twenty, sixth, dynasty, by, 653, bc, the, saite, king, psamtik, i, was, able, to, oust, the, assyrians, with, the, help, of, greek, mercenaries, who, were, recruited, to, form, egypt, s, first, navy, greek, influence, expanded, greatly, as, the, city, state, of, naucratis, became, the, home, of, greeks, in, the, nile, delta, the, saite, kings, based, in, the, new, capital, of, sais, witnessed, a, brief, but, spirited, resurgence, in, the, economy, and, culture, but, in, 525, bc, the, powerful, persians, led, by, cambyses, ii, began, their, conquest, of, egypt, eventually, capturing, the, pharaoh, psamtik, iii, at, the, battle, of, pelusium, cambyses, ii, then, assumed, the, formal, title, of, pharaoh, but, ruled, egypt, from, iran, leaving, egypt, under, the, control, of, a, satrap, a, few, successful, revolts, against, the, persians, marked, the, 5th, century, bc, but, egypt, was, never, able, to, permanently, overthrow, the, persians, following, its, annexation, by, persia, egypt, was, joined, with, cyprus, and, phoenicia, in, the, sixth, satrapy, of, the, achaemenid, persian, empire, this, first, period, of, persian, rule, over, egypt, also, known, as, the, twenty, seventh, dynasty, ended, in, 402, bc, when, egypt, regained, independence, under, a, series, of, native, dynasties, the, last, of, these, dynasties, the, thirtieth, proved, to, be, the, last, native, royal, house, of, ancient, egypt, ending, with, the, kingship, of, nectanebo, ii, a, brief, restoration, of, persian, rule, sometimes, known, as, the, thirty, first, dynasty, began, in, 343, bc, but, shortly, after, in, 332, bc, the, persian, ruler, mazaces, handed, egypt, over, to, alexander, the, great, without, a, fight, in, 332, bc, alexander, the, great, conquered, egypt, with, little, resistance, from, the, persians, and, was, welcomed, by, the, egyptians, as, a, deliverer, the, administration, established, by, alexander, s, successors, the, macedonian, ptolemaic, kingdom, was, based, on, an, egyptian, model, and, based, in, the, new, capital, city, of, alexandria, the, city, showcased, the, power, and, prestige, of, hellenistic, rule, and, became, a, centre, of, learning, and, culture, that, included, the, famous, library, of, alexandria, as, part, of, the, mouseion, the, lighthouse, of, alexandria, lit, the, way, for, the, many, ships, that, kept, trade, flowing, through, the, city, as, the, ptolemies, made, commerce, and, revenue, generating, enterprises, such, as, papyrus, manufacturing, their, top, priority, hellenistic, culture, did, not, supplant, native, egyptian, culture, as, the, ptolemies, supported, time, honored, traditions, in, an, effort, to, secure, the, loyalty, of, the, populace, they, built, new, temples, in, egyptian, style, supported, traditional, cults, and, portrayed, themselves, as, pharaohs, some, traditions, merged, as, greek, and, egyptian, gods, were, syncretized, into, composite, deities, such, as, serapis, and, classical, greek, forms, of, sculpture, influenced, traditional, egyptian, motifs, despite, their, efforts, to, appease, the, egyptians, the, ptolemies, were, challenged, by, native, rebellion, bitter, family, rivalries, and, the, powerful, mob, of, alexandria, that, formed, after, the, death, of, ptolemy, iv, in, addition, as, rome, relied, more, heavily, on, imports, of, grain, from, egypt, the, romans, took, great, interest, in, the, political, situation, in, the, country, continued, egyptian, revolts, ambitious, politicians, and, powerful, opponents, from, the, near, east, made, this, situation, unstable, leading, rome, to, send, forces, to, secure, the, country, as, a, province, of, its, empire, egypt, became, a, province, of, the, roman, empire, in, 30, bc, following, the, defeat, of, mark, antony, and, ptolemaic, queen,

prefect, appointed, by, the, emperor, quelled, rebellions, strictly, enforced, the, collection, of, heavy, taxes, and, prevented, attacks, by, bandits, which, had, become, a, notorious, problem, during, the, period, alexandria, became, an, increasingly, important, center, on, the, trade, route, with, the, orient, as, exotic, luxuries, were, in, high, demand, in, rome, although, the, romans, had, a, more, hostile, attitude, than, the, greeks, towards, the, egyptians, some, traditions, such, as, mummification, and, worship, of, the, traditional, gods, continued, the, art, of, mummy, portraiture, flourished, and, some, roman, emperors, had, themselves, depicted, as, pharaohs, though, not, to, the, extent, that, the, ptolemies, had, the, former, lived, outside, egypt, and, did, not, perform, the, ceremonial, functions, of, egyptian, kingship, local, administration, became, roman, in, style, and, closed, to, native, egyptians, from, the, mid, first, century, ad, christianity, took, root, in, egypt, and, it, was, originally, seen, as, another, cult, that, could, be, accepted, however, it, was, an, uncompromising, religion, that, sought, to, win, converts, from, the, pagan, egyptian, and, greco, roman, religions, and, threatened, popular, religious, traditions, this, led, to, the, persecution, of, converts, to, christianity, culminating, in, the, great, purges, of, diocletian, starting, in, 303, but, eventually, christianity, won, out, in, 391, the, christian, emperor, theodosius, introduced, legislation, that, banned, pagan, rites, and, closed, temples, alexandria, became, the, scene, of, great, anti, pagan, riots, with, public, and, private, religious, imagery, destroyed, as, a, consequence, egypt, s, native, religious, culture, was, continually, in, decline, while, the, native, population, continued, to, speak, their, language, the, ability, to, read, hieroglyphic, writing, slowly, disappeared, as, the, role, of, the, egyptian, temple, priests, and, priestesses, diminished, the, temples, themselves, were, sometimes, converted, to, churches, or, abandoned, to, the, desert, in, the, fourth, century, as, the, roman, empire, divided, egypt, found, itself, in, the, eastern, empire, with, its, capital, at, constantinople, in, the, waning, years, of, the, empire, egypt, fell, to, the, sasanian, persian, army, in, the, sasanian, conquest, of, egypt, 618, 628, it, was, then, recaptured, by, the, byzantine, emperor, heraclius, 629, 639, and, was, finally, captured, by, muslim, rashidun, army, in, 639, 641, marking, the, end, of, both, byzantine, rule, and, of, the, period, typically, considered, ancient, egypt, the, pharaoh, was, the, absolute, monarch, of, the, country, and, at, least, in, theory, wielded, complete, control, of, the, land, and, its, resources, the, king, was, the, supreme, military, commander, and, head, of, the, government, who, relied, on, a, bureaucracy, of, officials, to, manage, his, affairs, in, charge, of, the, administration, was, his, second, in, command, the, vizier, who, acted, as, the, king, s, representative, and, coordinated, land, surveys, the, treasury, building, projects, the, legal, system, and, the, archives, at, a, regional, level, the, country, was, divided, into, as, many, as, 42, administrative, regions, called, nomes, each, governed, by, a, nomarch, who, was, accountable, to, the, vizier, for, his, jurisdiction, the, temples, formed, the, backbone, of, the, economy, not, only, were, they, places, of, worship, but, were, also, responsible, for, collecting, and, storing, the, kingdom, s, wealth, in, a, system, of, granaries, and, treasuries, administered, by, overseers, who, redistributed, grain, and, goods, much, of, the, economy, was, centrally, organized, and, strictly, controlled, although, the, ancient, egyptians, did, not, use, coinage, until, the, late, period, they, did, use, a, type, of, money, barter, system, with, standard, sacks, of, grain, and, the, deben, a, weight, of, roughly, 91, grams, 3, oz, of, copper, or, silver, forming, a, common, denominator, workers, were, paid, in, grain, a, simple, laborer, might, earn, 5, 1, 2, sacks, 200, kg, or, 400, lb, of, grain, per, month, while, a, foreman, might, earn, 7, 1, 2, sacks, 250, kg, or, 550, lb, prices, were, fixed, across, the, country, and, recorded, in, lists, to, facilitate, trading, for, example, a, shirt, cost, five, copper, deben, while, a, cow, cost, 140, deben, grain, could, be, traded, for, other, goods, according, to, the, fixed, price, list, during, the, fifth, century, bc, coined, money, was, introduced, into, egypt, from, abroad, at, first, the, coins, were, used, as, standardized, pieces, of, precious, metal, rather, than, true, money, but, in, the, following, centuries, international, traders, came, to, rely, on, coinage, egyptian, society, was, highly, stratified, and, social, status, was, expressly, displayed, farmers, made, up, the, bulk, of, the, population, but, agricultural, produce, was, owned, directly, by, the, state, temple, or, noble, family, that, owned, the, land, farmers, were, also, subject, to, a, labor, tax, and, were, required, to, work, on, irrigation, or, construction, projects, in, a, corv, e, system, artists, and, craftsmen, were, of, higher, status, than, farmers, but, they, were, also, under, state, control, working, in, the, shops, attached, to, the, temples, and, paid, directly, from, the, state, treasury, scribes, and, officials, formed, the, upper, class, in, ancient, egypt, known, as, the, white, kilt, class, in, reference, to, the, bleached, linen, garments, that, served, as, a, mark, of, their, rank, the, upper, class, prominently, displayed, their, social, status, in, art, and, literature, below, the, nobility, were, the, priests, physicians, and, engineers, with, specialized, training, in, their, field, it, is, unclear, whether, slavery, as, understood, today, existed, in, ancient, egypt, there, is, difference, of, opinions, among, authors, the, ancient, egyptians, viewed, men, and, women, including, people, from, all, social, classes, as, essentially, equal, under, the, law, and, even, the, lowliest, peasant, was, entitled, to, petition, the, vizier, and, his, court, for, redress, although, slaves, were, mostly, used, as, indentured, servants, they, were, able, to, buy, and, sell, their, servitude, work, their, way, to, freedom, or, nobility, and, were, usually, treated, by, doctors, in, the, workplace, both, men, and, women, had, the, right, to, own, and, sell, property, make, contracts, marry, and, divorce, receive, inheritance, and, pursue, legal, disputes, in, court, married, couples, could, own, property, jointly, and, protect, themselves, from, divorce, by, agreeing, to, marriage, contracts, which, stipulated, the, financial, obligations, of, the, husband, to, his, wife, and, children, should, the, marriage, end, compared, with, their, counterparts, in, ancient, greece, rome, and, even, more, modern, places, around, the, world, ancient, egyptian, women, had, a, greater, range, of, personal, choices, legal, rights, and, opportunities, for, achievement, women, such, as, hatshepsut, and, cleopatra, vii, even, became, pharaohs, while, others, wielded, power, as, divine, wives, of, amun, despite, these, freedoms, ancient, egyptian, women, did, not, often, take, part, in, official, roles, in, the, administration, aside, from, the, royal, high, priestesses, apparently, served, only, secondary, roles, in, the, temples, not, much, data, for, many, dynasties, and, were, not, so, probably, to, be, as, educated, as, men, the, head, of, the, legal, system, was, officially, the, pharaoh, who, was, responsible, for, enacting, laws, delivering, justice, and, maintaining, law, and, order, a, concept, the, ancient, egyptians, referred, to, as, ma, at, although, no, legal, codes, from, ancient, egypt, survive, court, documents, show, that, egyptian, law, was, based, on, a, common, sense, view, of, right, and, wrong, that, emphasized, reaching, agreements, and, resolving, conflicts, rather, than, strictly, adhering, to, a, complicated, set, of, statutes, local, councils, of, elders, known, as, kenbet, in, the, new, kingdom, were, responsible, for, ruling, in, court, cases, involving, small, claims, and, minor, disputes, more, serious, cases, involving, murder, major, land, transactions, and, tomb, robbery, were, referred, to, the, great, kenbet, over, which, the,

answers, written, on, a, piece, of, papyrus, or, an, ostracon, a, combination, of, favorable, geographical, features, contributed, to, the, success, of, ancient, egyptian, culture, the, most, important, of, which, was, the, rich, fertile, soil, resulting, from, annual, inundations, of, the, nile, river, the, ancient, egyptians, were, thus, able, to, produce, an, abundance, of, food, allowing, the, population, to, devote, more, time, and, resources, to, cultural, technological, and, artistic, pursuits, land, management, was, crucial, in, ancient, egypt, because, taxes, were, assessed, based, on, the, amount, of, land, a, person, owned, farming, in, egypt, was, dependent, on, the, cycle, of, the, nile, river, the, egyptians, recognized, three, seasons, akhet, flooding, peret, planting, and, shemu, harvesting, the, flooding, season, lasted, from, june, to, september, depositing, on, the, river, s, banks, a, layer, of, mineral, rich, silt, ideal, for, growing, crops, after, the, floodwaters, had, receded, the, growing, season, lasted, from, october, to, february, farmers, plowed, and, planted, seeds, in, the, fields, which, were, irrigated, with, ditches, and, canals, egypt, received, little, rainfall, so, farmers, relied, on, the, nile, to, water, their, crops, from, march, to, may, farmers, used, sickles, to, harvest, their, crops, which, were, then, threshed, with, a, flail, to, separate, the, straw, from, the, grain, winnowing, removed, the, chaff, from, the, grain, and, the, grain, was, then, ground, into, flour, brewed, to, make, beer, or, stored, for, later, use, the, ancient, egyptians, cultivated, emmer, and, barley, and, several, other, cereal, grains, all, of, which, were, used, to, make, the, two, main, food, staples, of, bread, and, beer, flax, plants, uprooted, before, they, started, flowering, were, grown, for, the, fibers, of, their, stems, these, fibers, were, split, along, their, length, and, spun, into, thread, which, was, used, to, weave, sheets, of, linen, and, to, make, clothing, papyrus, growing, on, the, banks, of, the, nile, river, was, used, to, make, paper, vegetables, and, fruits, were, grown, in, garden, plots, close, to, habitations, and, on, higher, ground, and, had, to, be, watered, by, hand, vegetables, included, leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and, other, crops, in, addition, to, grapes, that, were, made, into, wine, the, egyptians, believed, that, a, balanced, relationship, between, people, and, animals, was, an, essential, element, of, the, cosmic, order, thus, humans, animals, and, plants, were, believed, to, be, members, of, a, single, whole, animals, both, domesticated, and, wild, were, therefore, a, critical, source, of, spirituality, companionship, and, sustenance, to, the, ancient, egyptians, cattle, were, the, most, important, livestock, the, administration, collected, taxes, on, livestock, in, regular, censuses, and, the, size, of, a, herd,

also, domesticated, from, at, least, the, old, kingdom, and, provided, both, honey, and, wax, the, ancient, egyptians, used, donkeys, and, oxen, as, beasts, of, burden, and, they, were, responsible, for, plowing, the, fields, and, trampling, seed, into, the, soil, the, slaughter, of, a, fattened, ox, was, also, a, central, part, of, an, offering, ritual, horses, were, introduced, by, the, hyksos, in, the, second, intermediate, period, camels, although, known, from, the, new, kingdom, were, not, used, as, beasts, of, burden, until, the, late, period, there, is, also, evidence, to, suggest, that, elephants, were, briefly, used, in, the, late, period, but, largely, abandoned, due, to, lack, of, grazing, land, cats, dogs, and, monkeys, were, common, family, pets, while, more, exotic, pets, imported, from, the, heart, of, africa, such, as, sub, saharan, african, lions, were, reserved, for, royalty, herodotus, observed, that, the, egyptians, were, the, only, people, to, keep, their, animals, with, them, in, their, houses, during, the, late, period, the, worship, of, the, gods, in, their, animal, form, was, extremely, popular, such, as, the, cat, goddess, bastet, and, the, ibis, god, thoth, and, these, animals, were, kept, in, large, numbers, for, the, purpose, of, ritual, sacrifice, egypt, is, rich, in, building, and, decorative, stone, copper, and, lead, ores, gold, and,

of, a, gold, mine, in, this, region, the, wadi, hammamat, was, a, notable, source, of, granite, greywacke, and, gold, flint, was, the, first, mineral, collected, and, used, to, make, tools, and, flint, handaxes, are, the, earliest, pieces, of, evidence, of, habitation, in, the, nile, valley, nodules, of, the, mineral, were, carefully, flaked, to, make, blades, and, arrowheads, of, moderate, hardness, and, durability, even, after, copper, was, adopted, for, this, purpose, ancient, egyptians, were, among, the, first, to, use, minerals, such, as, sulfur, as, cosmetic, substances, the, egyptians, worked, deposits, of, the, lead, ore, galena, at, gebel, rosas, to, make, net, sinkers, plumb, bobs, and, small, figurines, copper, was, the, most, important, metal, for, toolmaking, in,

coptic, but, it, was, probably, spoken, in, regional, dialects, around, memphis, and, later, thebes, ancient, egyptian, was, a, synthetic, language, but, it, became, more, analytic, later, on, late, egyptian, developed, prefixal, definite, and, indefinite, articles, which, replaced, the, older, inflectional, suffixes, there, was, a, change, from, the, older, verb, subject, object, word, order, to, subject, verb, object, the, egyptian, hieroglyphic, hieratic, and, demotic, scripts, were, eventually, replaced, by, the, more, phonetic, coptic, alphabet, coptic, is, still, used, in, the, liturgy, of, the, egyptian, orthodox, church, and, traces, of, it, are, found, in, modern, egyptian, arabic, ancient, egyptian, has, 25, consonants, similar, to, those, of, other, afro, asiatic, languages, these, include, pharyngeal, and, emphatic, consonants, voiced, and, voiceless, stops, voiceless, fricatives, and, voiced, and, voiceless, affricates, it, has, three, long, and, three,

works, of, art, in, day, to, day, writing, scribes, used, a, cursive, form, of, writing, called, hieratic, which, was, quicker, and, easier, while, formal, hieroglyphs, may, be, read, in, rows, or, columns, in, either, direction, though, typically, written, from, right, to, left, hieratic, was, always, written, from, right, to, left, usually, in, horizontal, rows, a, new, form, of, writing, demotic, became, the, prevalent, writing, style, and, it, is, this, form, of, writing, along, with, formal, hieroglyphs, that, accompany, the, greek, text, on, the, rosetta, stone, around, the, first, century, ad, the, coptic, alphabet, started, to, be, used, alongside, the, demotic, script, coptic, is, a, modified, greek, alphabet, with, the, addition, of, some, demotic, signs, although, formal, hieroglyphs, were, used, in, a, ceremonial, role, until, the, fourth, century, towards, the, end, only, a, small, handful, of, priests, could, still, read, them, as, the, traditional, religious, establishments, were, disbanded, knowledge, of, hieroglyphic, writing, was, mostly, lost, attempts, to, decipher, them, date, to, the, byzantine, and, islamic, periods, in, egypt, but, only, in, the, 1820s, after, the, discovery, of, the, rosetta, stone, and, years, of, research, by, thomas, young, and, jean, fran, ois, champollion, were, hieroglyphs, substantially, deciphered, writing, first, appeared, in, association, with, kingship, on, labels, and, tags, for, items, found, in, royal, tombs, it, was, primarily, an, occupation, of, the, scribes, who, worked, out, of, the, per, ankh,

the, children, while, the, father, provided, the, family, s, income, music, and, dance, were, popular, entertainments, for, those, who, could, afford, them, early, instruments, included, flutes, and, harps, while, instruments, similar, to, trumpets, oboes, and, pipes, developed, later, and, became, popular, in, the, new, kingdom, the, egyptians, played, on, bells, cymbals, tambourines, drums, and, imported, lutes, and, lyres, from, asia, the, sistrum, was, a, rattle, like, musical, instrument, that, was, especially, important, in, religious, ceremonies, the, ancient, egyptians, enjoyed, a, variety, of, leisure, activities, including, games, and, music, senet, a, board, game, where, pieces, moved, according, to, random, chance, was, particularly, popular, from, the, earliest, times, another, similar, game, was, mehen, which, had, a, circular, gaming, board, hounds, and, jackals, also, known, as, 58, holes, is, another, example, of, board, games, played, in, ancient, egypt, the, first, complete, set, of, this, game, was, discovered, from, a, theban, tomb, of, the, egyptian, pharaoh, amenemhat, iv, that, dates, to, the, 13th, dynasty, juggling, and, ball, games, were, popular, with, children, and, wrestling, is, also, documented, in, a, tomb, at, beni, hasan, the, wealthy, members, of, ancient, egyptian, society, enjoyed, hunting, fishing, and, boating, as, well, the, excavation, of, the, workers, village, of, deir, el, medina, has, resulted, in, one, of, the, most, thoroughly, documented, accounts, of, community, life, in, the, ancient, world, which, spans, almost, four, hundred, years, there, is, no, comparable, site, in, which, the, organization, social, interactions, and, working, and, living, conditions, of, a, community, have, been, studied, in, such, detail, egyptian, cuisine, remained, remarkably, stable, over, time, indeed, the, cuisine, of, modern, egypt, retains, some, striking, similarities, to, the, cuisine, of, the, ancients, the, staple, diet, consisted, of, bread, and, beer, supplemented, with, vegetables, such, as, onions, and, garlic, and, fruit, such, as, dates, and, figs, wine, and, meat, were, enjoyed, by, all, on, feast, days, while, the, upper, classes, indulged, on, a, more, regular, basis, fish, meat, and, fowl, could, be, salted, or, dried, and, could, be, cooked, in, stews, or, roasted, on, a, grill, the, architecture, of, ancient, egypt, includes, some, of, the, most, famous, structures, in, the, world, the, great, pyramids, of, giza, and, the, temples, at, thebes, building, projects, were, organized, and, funded, by, the, state, for, religious, and, commemorative, purposes, but, also, to, reinforce, the, wide, ranging, power, of, the, pharaoh, the, ancient, egyptians, were, skilled, builders, using, only, simple, but, effective, tools, and, sighting, instruments, architects, could, build, large, stone, structures, with, great, accuracy, and, precision, that, is, still, envied, today, the, domestic, dwellings, of, elite, and, ordinary, egyptians, alike, were, constructed, from, perishable, materials, such, as, mudbricks, and, wood, and, have, not, survived, peasants, lived, in, simple, homes, while, the, palaces, of, the, elite, and, the, pharaoh, were, more, elaborate, structures, a, few, surviving, new, kingdom, palaces, such, as, those, in, malkata, and, amarna, show, richly, decorated, walls, and, floors, with, scenes, of, people, birds, water, pools, deities, and, geometric, designs, important, structures, such, as, temples, and, tombs, that, were, intended, to, last, forever, were, constructed, of, stone, instead, of, mudbricks, the, architectural, elements, used, in, the, world, s, first, large, scale, stone, building, djoser, s, mortuary, complex, include, post, and, lintel, supports, in, the, papyrus, and, lotus, motif, the, earliest, preserved, ancient, egyptian, temples, such, as, those, at, giza, consist, of, single, enclosed, halls, with, roof, slabs, supported, by, columns, in, the, new, kingdom, architects, added, the, pylon, the, open, courtyard, and, the, enclosed, hypostyle, hall, to, the, front, of, the, temple, s, sanctuary, a, style, that, was, standard, until, the, greco, roman, period, the, earliest, and, most, popular, tomb, architecture, in, the, old, kingdom, was, the, mastaba, a, flat, roofed, rectangular, structure, of, mudbrick, or, stone, built, over, an, underground, burial, chamber, the, step, pyramid, of, djoser, is, a, series, of, stone, mastabas, stacked, on, top, of, each, other, pyramids, were, built, during, the, old, and, middle, kingdoms, but, most, later, rulers, abandoned, them, in, favor, of, less, conspicuous, rock, cut, tombs, the, use, of, the, pyramid, form, continued, in, private, tomb, chapels, of, the, new, kingdom, and, in, the, royal, pyramids, of, nubia, the, ancient, egyptians, produced, art, to, serve, functional, purposes, for, over, 3500, years, artists, adhered, to, artistic, forms, and, iconography, that, were, developed, during, the, old, kingdom, following, a, strict, set, of, principles, that, resisted, foreign, influence, and, internal, change, these, artistic, standards, simple, lines, shapes, and, flat, areas, of, color, combined, with, the, characteristic, flat, projection, of, figures, with, no, indication, of, spatial, depth, created, a, sense, of, order, and, balance, within, a, composition, images, and, text, were, intimately, interwoven, on, tomb, and, temple, walls, coffins, stelae, and, even, statues, the, narmer, palette, for, example, displays, figures, that, can, also, be, read, as, hieroglyphs, because, of, the, rigid, rules, that, governed, its, highly, stylized, and, symbolic, appearance, ancient, egyptian, art, served, its, political, and, religious, purposes, with, precision, and, clarity, ancient, egyptian, artisans, used, stone, as, a, medium, for, carving, statues, and, fine, reliefs, but, used, wood, as, a, cheap, and, easily, carved, substitute, paints, were, obtained, from, minerals, such, as, iron, ores, red, and, yellow, ochres, copper, ores, blue, and, green, soot, or, charcoal, black, and, limestone, white, paints, could, be, mixed, with, gum, arabic, as, a, binder, and, pressed, into, cakes, which, could, be, moistened, with, water, when, needed, pharaohs, used, reliefs, to, record, victories, in, battle, royal, decrees, and, religious, scenes, common, citizens, had, access, to, pieces, of, funerary, art, such, as, shabti, statues, and, books, of, the, dead, which, they, believed, would, protect, them, in, the, afterlife, during, the, middle, kingdom, wooden, or, clay, models, depicting, scenes, from, everyday, life, became, popular, additions, to, the, tomb, in, an, attempt, to, duplicate, the, activities, of, the, living, in, the, afterlife, these, models, show, laborers, houses, boats, and, even, military, formations, that, are, scale, representations, of, the, ideal, ancient, egyptian, afterlife, despite, the, homogeneity, of, ancient, egyptian, art, the, styles, of, particular, times, and, places, sometimes, reflected, changing, cultural, or, political, attitudes, after, the, invasion, of, the, hyksos, in, the, second, intermediate, period, minoan, style, frescoes, were, found, in, avaris, the, most, striking, example, of, a, politically, driven, change, in, artistic, forms, comes, from, the, amarna, period, where, figures, were, radically, altered, to, conform, to, akhenaten, s, revolutionary, religious, ideas, this, style, known, as, amarna, art, was, quickly, abandoned, after, akhenaten, s, death, and, replaced, by, the, traditional, forms, beliefs, in, the, divine, and, in, the, afterlife, were, ingrained, in, ancient, egyptian, civilization, from, its, inception, pharaonic, rule, was, based, on, the, divine, right, of, kings, the, egyptian, pantheon, was, populated, by, gods, who, had, supernatural, powers, and, were, called, on, for, help, or, protection, however, the, gods, were, not, always, viewed, as, benevolent, and, egyptians, believed, they, had, to, be, appeased, with, offerings, and, prayers, the, structure, of, this, pantheon, changed, continually, as, new, deities, were, promoted, in, the, hierarchy, but, priests, made, no, effort, to, organize, the, diverse, and, sometimes, conflicting, myths, and, stories, into, a, coherent, system, these, various, conceptions, of, divinity, were, not, considered, contradictory, but, rather, layers, in, the, multiple, facets, of, reality, gods, were, worshiped, in, cult, temples, administered, by, priests, acting, on, the, king, s, behalf, at, the, center, of, the, temple, was, the, cult, statue, in, a, shrine, temples, were, not, places, of, public, worship, or, congregation, and, only, on, select, feast, days, and, celebrations, was, a, shrine, carrying, the, statue, of, the, god, brought, out, for, public, worship, normally, the, god, s, domain, was, sealed, off, from, the, outside, world, and, was, only, accessible, to, temple, officials, common, citizens, could, worship, private, statues, in, their, homes, and, amulets, offered, protection, against, the, forces, of, chaos, after, the, new, kingdom, the, pharaoh, s, role, as, a, spiritual, intermediary, was, de, emphasized, as, religious, customs, shifted, to, direct, worship, of, the, gods, as, a, result, priests, developed, a, system, of, oracles, to, communicate, the, will, of, the, gods, directly, to, the, people, the, egyptians, believed, that, every, human, being, was, composed, of, physical, and, spiritual, parts, or, aspects, in, addition, to, the, body, each, person, had, a, wt, shadow, a, ba, personality, or, soul, a, ka, life, force, and, a, name, the, heart, rather, than, the, brain, was, considered, the, seat, of, thoughts, and, emotions, after, death, the, spiritual, aspects, were, released, from, the, body, and, could, move, at, will, but, they, required, the, physical, remains, or, a, substitute, such, as, a, statue, as, a, permanent, home, the, ultimate, goal, of, the, deceased, was, to, rejoin, his, ka, and, ba, and, become, one, of, the, blessed, dead, living, on, as, an, akh, or, effective, one, for, this, to, happen, the, deceased, had, to, be, judged, worthy, in, a, trial, in, which, the, heart, was, weighed, against, a, feather, of, truth, if, deemed, worthy, the, deceased, could, continue, their, existence, on, earth, in, spiritual, form, if, they, were, not, deemed, worthy, their, heart, was, eaten, by, ammit, the, devourer, and, they, were, erased, from, the, universe, the, ancient, egyptians, maintained, an, elaborate, set, of, burial, customs, that, they, believed, were, necessary, to, ensure, immortality, after, death, these, customs, involved, preserving, the, body, by, mummification, performing, burial, ceremonies, and, interring, with, the, body, goods, the, deceased, would, use, in, the, afterlife, before, the, old, kingdom, bodies, buried, in, desert, pits, were, naturally, preserved, by, desiccation, the, arid, desert, conditions, were, a, boon, throughout, the, history, of, ancient, egypt, for, burials, of, the, poor, who, could, not, afford, the, elaborate, burial, preparations, available, to, the, elite, wealthier, egyptians, began, to, bury, their, dead, in, stone, tombs, and, use, artificial, mummification, which, involved, removing, the, internal, organs, wrapping, the, body, in, linen, and, burying, it, in, a, rectangular, stone, sarcophagus, or, wooden, coffin, beginning, in, the, fourth, dynasty, some, parts, were, preserved, separately, in, canopic, jars, by, the, new, kingdom, the, ancient, egyptians, had, perfected, the, art, of, mummification, the, best, technique, took, 70, days, and, involved, removing, the, internal, organs, removing, the, brain, through, the, nose, and, desiccating, the, body, in, a, mixture, of, salts, called, natron, the, body, was, then, wrapped, in, linen, with, protective, amulets, inserted, between, layers, and, placed, in, a, decorated, anthropoid, coffin, mummies, of, the, late, period, were, also, placed, in, painted, cartonnage, mummy, cases, actual, preservation, practices, declined, during, the, ptolemaic, and, roman, eras, while, greater, emphasis, was, placed, on, the, outer, appearance, of, the, mummy, which, was, decorated, wealthy, egyptians, were, buried, with, larger, quantities, of, luxury, items, but, all, burials, regardless, of, social, status, included, goods, for, the, deceased, funerary, texts, were, often, included, in, the, grave, and, beginning, in, the, new, kingdom, so, were, shabti, statues, that, were, believed, to, perform, manual, labor, for, them, in, the, afterlife, rituals, in, which, the, deceased, was, magically, re, animated, accompanied, burials, after, burial, living, relatives, were, expected, to, occasionally, bring, food, to, the, tomb, and, recite, prayers, on, behalf, of, the, deceased, the, ancient, egyptian, military, was, responsible, for, defending, egypt, against, foreign, invasion, and, for, maintaining, egypt, s, domination, in, the, ancient, near, east, the, military, protected, mining, expeditions, to, the, sinai, during, the, old, kingdom, and, fought, civil, wars, during, the, first, and, second, intermediate, periods, the, military, was, responsible, for, maintaining, fortifications, along, important, trade, routes, such, as, those, found, at, the, city, of, buhen, on, the, way, to, nubia, forts, also, were, constructed, to, serve, as, military, bases, such, as, the, fortress, at, sile, which, was, a, base, of, operations, for, expeditions, to, the, levant, in, the, new, kingdom, a, series, of, pharaohs, used, the, standing, egyptian, army, to, attack, and, conquer, kush, and, parts, of, the, levant, typical, military, equipment, included, bows, and, arrows, spears, and, round, topped, shields, made, by, stretching, animal, skin, over, a, wooden, frame, in, the, new, kingdom, the, military, began, using, chariots, that, had, earlier, been, introduced, by, the, hyksos, invaders, weapons, and, armor, continued, to, improve, after, the, adoption, of, bronze, shields, were, now, made, from, solid, wood, with, a, bronze, buckle, spears, were, tipped, with, a, bronze, point, and, the, khopesh, was, adopted, from, asiatic, soldiers, the, pharaoh, was, usually, depicted, in, art, and, literature, riding, at, the, head, of, the, army, it, has, been, suggested, that, at, least, a, few, pharaohs, such, as, seqenenre, tao, ii, and, his, sons, did, do, so, however, it, has, also, been, argued, that, kings, of, this, period, did, not, personally, act, as, frontline, war, leaders, fighting, alongside, their, troops, soldiers, were, recruited, from, the, general, population, but, during, and, especially, after, the, new, kingdom, mercenaries, from, nubia, kush, and, libya, were, hired, to, fight, for, egypt, in, technology, medicine, and, mathematics, ancient, egypt, achieved, a, relatively, high, standard, of, productivity, and, sophistication, traditional, empiricism, as, evidenced, by, the, edwin, smith, and, ebers, papyri, c, 1600, bc, is, first, credited, to, egypt, the, egyptians, created, their, own, alphabet, and, decimal, system, even, before, the, old, kingdom, the, ancient, egyptians, had, developed, a, glassy, material, known, as, faience, which, they, treated, as, a, type, of, artificial, semi, precious, stone, faience, is, a, non, clay, ceramic, made, of, silica, small, amounts, of, lime, and, soda, and, a, colorant, typically, copper, the, material, was, used, to, make, beads, tiles, figurines, and, small, wares, several, methods, can, be, used, to, create, faience, but, typically, production, involved, application, of, the, powdered, materials, in, the, form, of, a, paste, over, a, clay, core, which, was, then, fired, by, a, related, technique, the, ancient, egyptians, produced, a, pigment, known, as, egyptian, blue, also, called, blue, frit, which, is, produced, by, fusing, or, sintering, silica, copper, lime, and, an, alkali, such, as, natron, the, product, can, be, ground, up, and, used, as, a, pigment, the, ancient, egyptians, could, fabricate, a, wide, variety, of, objects, from, glass, with, great, skill, but, it, is, not, clear, whether, they, developed, the, process, independently, it, is, also, unclear, whether, they, made, their, own, raw, glass, or, merely, imported, pre, made, ingots, which, they, melted, and, finished, however, they, did, have, technical, expertise, in, making, objects, as, well, as, adding, trace, elements, to, control, the, color, of, the, finished, glass, a, range, of, colors, could, be, produced, including, yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and, white, and, the, glass, could, be, made, either, transparent, or, opaque, the, medical, problems, of, the, ancient, egyptians, stemmed, directly, from, their, environment, living, and, working, close, to, the, nile, brought, hazards, from, malaria, and, debilitating, schistosomiasis, parasites, which, caused, liver, and, intestinal, damage, dangerous, wildlife, such, as, crocodiles, and, hippos, were, also, a, common, threat, the, lifelong, labors, of, farming, and, building, put, stress, on, the, spine, and, joints, and, traumatic, injuries, from, construction, and, warfare, all, took, a, significant, toll, on, the, body, the, grit, and, sand, from, stone, ground, flour, abraded, teeth, leaving, them, susceptible, to, abscesses, though, caries, were, rare, the, diets, of, the, wealthy, were, rich, in, sugars, which, promoted, periodontal, disease, despite, the, flattering, physiques, portrayed, on, tomb, walls, the, overweight, mummies, of, many, of, the, upper, class, show, the, effects, of, a, life, of, overindulgence, adult, life, expectancy, was, about, 35, for, men, and, 30, for, women, but, reaching, adulthood, was, difficult, as, about, one, third, of, the, population, died, in, infancy, ancient, egyptian, physicians, were, renowned, in, the, ancient, near, east, for, their, healing, skills, and, some, such, as, imhotep, remained, famous, long, after, their, deaths, herodotus, remarked, that, there, was, a, high, degree, of, specialization, among, egyptian, physicians, with, some, treating, only, the, head, or, the, stomach, while, others, were, eye, doctors, and, dentists, training, of, physicians, took, place, at, the, per, ankh, or, house, of, life, institution, most, notably, those, headquartered, in, per, bastet, during, the, new, kingdom, and, at, abydos, and, sa, s, in, the, late, period, medical, papyri, show, empirical, knowledge, of, anatomy, injuries, and, practical, treatments, wounds, were, treated, by, bandaging, with, raw, meat, white, linen, sutures, nets, pads, and, swabs, soaked, with, honey, to, prevent, infection, while, opium, thyme, and, belladona, were, used, to, relieve, pain, the, earliest, records, of, burn, treatment, describe, burn, dressings, that, use, the, milk, from, mothers, of, male, babies, prayers, were, made, to, the, goddess, isis, moldy, bread, honey, and, copper, salts, were, also, used, to, prevent, infection, from, dirt, in, burns, garlic, and, onions, were, used, regularly, to, promote, good, health, and, were, thought, to, relieve, asthma, symptoms, ancient, egyptian, surgeons, stitched, wounds, set, broken, bones, and, amputated, diseased, limbs, but, they, recognized, that, some, injuries, were, so, serious, that, they, could, only, make, the, patient, comfortable, until, death, occurred, early, egyptians, knew, how, to, assemble, planks, of, wood, into, a, ship, hull, and, had, mastered, advanced, forms, of, shipbuilding, as, early, as, 3000, bc, the, archaeological, institute, of, america, reports, that, the, oldest, planked, ships, known, are, the, abydos, boats, a, group, of, 14, discovered, ships, in, abydos, were, constructed, of, wooden, planks, sewn, together, discovered, by, egyptologist, david, o, connor, of, new, york, university, woven, straps, were, found, to, have, been, used, to, lash, the, planks, together, and, reeds, or, grass, stuffed, between, the, planks, helped, to, seal, the, seams, because, the, ships, are, all, buried, together, and, near, a, mortuary, belonging, to, pharaoh, khasekhemwy, originally, they, were, all, thought, to, have, belonged, to, him, but, one, of, the, 14, ships, dates, to, 3000, bc, and, the, associated, pottery, jars, buried, with, the, vessels, also, suggest, earlier, dating, the, ship, dating, to, 3000, bc, was, 75, feet, 23, m, long, and, is, now, thought, to, perhaps, have, belonged, to, an, earlier, pharaoh, perhaps, one, as, early, as, hor, aha, early, egyptians, also, knew, how, to, assemble, planks, of, wood, with, treenails, to, fasten, them, together, using, pitch, for, caulking, the, seams, the, khufu, ship, a, 43, 6, metre, 143, ft, vessel, sealed, into, a, pit, in, the, giza, pyramid, complex, at, the, foot, of, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, in, the, fourth, dynasty, around, 2500, bc, is, a, full, size, surviving, example, that, may, have, filled, the, symbolic, function, of, a, solar, barque, early, egyptians, also, knew, how, to, fasten, the, planks, of, this, ship, together, with, mortise, and, tenon, joints, large, seagoing, ships, are, known, to, have, been, heavily, used, by, the, egyptians, in, their, trade, with, the, city, states, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, especially, byblos, on, the, coast, of, modern, day, lebanon, and, in, several, expeditions, down, the, red, sea, to, the, land, of, punt, in, fact, one, of, the, earliest, egyptian, words, for, a, seagoing, ship, is, a, byblos, ship, which, originally, defined, a, class, of, egyptian, seagoing, ships, used, on, the, byblos, run, however, by, the, end, of, the, old, kingdom, the, term, had, come, to, include, large, seagoing, ships, whatever, their, destination, in, 1977, an, ancient, north, south, canal, was, discovered, extending, from, lake, timsah, to, the, ballah, lakes, it, was, dated, to, the, middle, kingdom, of, egypt, by, extrapolating, dates, of, ancient, sites, constructed, along, its, course, in, 2011, archaeologists, from, italy, the, united, states, and, egypt, excavating, a, dried, up, lagoon, known, as, mersa, gawasis, unearthed, traces, of, an, ancient, harbor, that, once, launched, early, voyages, such, as, hatshepsut, s, punt, expedition, onto, the, open, ocean, some, of, the, site, s, most, evocative, evidence, for, the, ancient, egyptians, seafaring, prowess, include, large, ship, timbers, and, hundreds, of, feet, of, ropes, made, from, papyrus, coiled, in, huge, bundles, in, 2013, a, team, of, franco, egyptian, archaeologists, discovered, what, is, believed, to, be, the, world, s, oldest, port, dating, back, about, 4500, years, from, the, time, of, king, khufu, on, the, red, sea, coast, near, wadi, el, jarf, about, 110, miles, south, of, suez, the, earliest, attested, examples, of, mathematical, calculations, date, to, the, predynastic, naqada, period, and, show, a, fully, developed, numeral, system, the, importance, of, mathematics, to, an, educated, egyptian, is, suggested, by, a, new, kingdom, fictional, letter, in, which, the, writer, proposes, a, scholarly, competition, between, himself, and, another, scribe, regarding, everyday, calculation, tasks, such, as, accounting, of, land, labor, and, grain, texts, such, as, the, rhind, mathematical, papyrus, and, the, moscow, mathematical, papyrus, show, that, the, ancient, egyptians, could, perform, the, four, basic, mathematical, operations, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and, division, use, fractions, calculate, the, areas, of, rectangles, triangles, and, circles, and, compute, the, volumes, of, boxes, columns, and, pyramids, they, understood, basic, concepts, of, algebra, and, geometry, and, could, solve, systems, of, equations, mathematical, notation, was, decimal, and, based, on, hieroglyphic, signs, for, each, power, of, ten, up, to, one, million, each, of, these, could, be, written, as, many, times, as, necessary, to, add, up, to, the, desired, number, so, to, write, the, number, eighty, or, eight, hundred, the, symbol, for, ten, or, one, hundred, was, written, eight, times, respectively, because, their, methods, of, calculation, could, not, handle, most, fractions, with, a, numerator, greater, than, one, they, had, to, write, fractions, as, the, sum, of, several, fractions, for, example, they, resolved, the, fraction, two, fifths, into, the, sum, of, one, third, one, fifteenth, standard, tables, of, values, facilitated, this, some, common, fractions, however, were, written, with, a, special, glyph, the, equivalent, of, the, modern, two, thirds, is, shown, on, the, right, ancient, egyptian, mathematicians, knew, the, pythagorean, theorem, as, an, empirical, formula, they, were, aware, for, example, that, a, triangle, had, a, right, angle, opposite, the, hypotenuse, when, its, sides, were, in, a, 3, 4, 5, ratio, they, were, able, to, estimate, the, area, of, a, circle, by, subtracting, one, ninth, from, its, diameter, and, squaring, the, result, a, reasonable, approximation, of, the, formula, r, 2, estimates, of, the, size, of, the, population, range, from, 1, 1, 5, million, in, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, to, possibly, 2, 3, million, by, the, 1st, millennium, bc, before, growing, significantly, towards, the, end, of, that, millennium, according, to, historian, william, stiebling, and, archaeologist, susan, n, helft, conflicting, dna, analysis, on, recent, genetic, samples, such, as, the, amarna, royal, mummies, has, led, to, a, lack, of, consensus, on, the, genetic, makeup, of, the, ancient, egyptians, and, their, geographic, origins, the, genetic, history, of, ancient, egypt, remains, a, developing, field, and, is, relevant, for, the, understanding, of, population, demographic, events, connecting, africa, and, eurasia, to, date, the, amount, of, genome, wide, adna, analyses, on, ancient, specimens, from, egypt, and, sudan, remain, scarce, although, studies, on, uniparental, haplogroups, in, ancient, individuals, have, been, carried, out, several, times, pointing, broadly, to, affinities, with, other, african, and, eurasian, groups, the, currently, most, advanced, full, genome, analyses, was, made, on, three, ancient, specimens, recovered, from, the, nile, river, valley, abusir, el, meleq, egypt, two, of, the, individuals, were, dated, to, the, pre, ptolemaic, period, new, kingdom, to, late, period, and, one, individual, to, the, ptolemaic, period, spanning, around, 1300, years, of, egyptian, history, these, results, point, to, a, genetic, continuity, of, ancient, egyptians, with, modern, egyptians, the, results, further, point, to, a, close, genetic, affinity, between, ancient, egyptians, and, middle, eastern, populations, especially, ancient, groups, from, the, levant, natufian, culture, ancient, egyptians, also, displayed, affinities, to, nubians, to, the, south, of, egypt, in, modern, day, sudan, archaeological, and, historical, evidence, support, interactions, between, egyptian, and, nubian, populations, more, than, 5000, years, ago, with, socio, political, dynamics, between, egyptians, and, nubians, ranging, from, peaceful, coexistence, to, variably, successful, attempts, of, conquest, a, study, on, sixty, six, ancient, nubian, individuals, revealed, significant, contact, with, ancient, egyptians, characterized, by, the, presence, of, c, 57, neolithic, bronze, age, levantine, ancestry, in, these, individuals, such, geneflow, of, levantine, like, ancestry, corresponds, with, archaeological, and, botanic, evidence, pointing, to, a, neolithic, movement, around, 7, 000, years, ago, genetic, data, on, other, northern, african, specimens, such, as, the, c, 15, 000, year, old, iberomaurusian, taforalt, man, but, also, specimens, from, the, last, green, sahara, and, the, savanna, pastoral, neolithic, point, to, the, widespread, presence, of, an, western, eurasian, ancestry, component, distributed, throughout, northern, africa, the, sahara, and, the, horn, of, africa, having, arrived, via, back, migration, s, from, the, middle, east, starting, as, early, as, c, 23, 000, years, ago, modern, egyptians, like, modern, nubians, underwent, subsequent, admixture, events, contributing, both, sub, saharan, african, like, and, west, asian, like, ancestries, since, the, roman, period, with, significance, on, the, african, slave, trade, and, the, spread, of, islam, some, scholars, such, as, christopher, ehret, caution, that, a, wider, sampling, area, is, needed, and, argue, that, the, current, data, is, inconclusive, on, the, origin, of, ancient, egyptians, they, also, point, out, issues, with, the, previously, used, methodology, such, as, the, sampling, size, comparative, approach, and, a, biased, interpretation, of, the, genetic, data, they, argue, in, favor, for, a, link, between, ancient, egypt, and, the, northern, horn, of, africa, this, latter, view, has, been, attributed, to, the, corresponding, archaeological, genetic, linguistic, and, biological, anthropological, sources, of, evidence, which, broadly, indicate, that, the, earliest, egyptians, and, nubians, were, the, descendants, of, populations, in, northeast, africa, the, culture, and, monuments, of, ancient, egypt, have, left, a, lasting, legacy, on, the, world, egyptian, civilization, significantly, influenced, the, kingdom, of, kush, and, mero, with, both, adopting, egyptian, religious, and, architectural, norms, hundreds, of, pyramids, 6, 30, meters, high, were, built, in, egypt, sudan, as, well, as, using, egyptian, writing, as, the, basis, of, the, meroitic, script, meroitic, is, the, oldest, written, language, in, africa, other, than, egyptian, and, was, used, from, the, 2nd, century, bc, until, the, early, 5th, century, ad, the, cult, of, the, goddess, isis, for, example, became, popular, in, the, roman, empire, as, obelisks, and, other, relics, were, transported, back, to, rome, the, romans, also, imported, building, materials, from, egypt, to, erect, egyptian, style, structures, early, historians, such, as, herodotus, strabo, and, diodorus, siculus, studied, and, wrote, about, the, land, which, romans, came, to, view, as, a, place, of, mystery, during, the, middle, ages, and, the, renaissance, egyptian, pagan, culture, was, in, decline, after, the, rise, of, christianity, and, later, islam, but, interest, in, egyptian, antiquity, continued, in, the, writings, of, medieval, scholars, such, as, dhul, nun, al, misri, and, al, maqrizi, in, the, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, centuries, european, travelers, and, tourists, brought, back, antiquities, and, wrote, stories, of, their, journeys, leading, to, a, wave, of, egyptomania, across, europe, as, evident, in, symbolism, such, as, the, eye, of, providence, and, the, great, seal, of, the, united, states, this, renewed, interest, sent, collectors, to, egypt, who, took, purchased, or, were, given, many, important, antiquities, napoleon, arranged, the, first, studies, in, egyptology, when, he, brought, some, 150, scientists, and, artists, to, study, and, document, egypt, s, natural, history, which, was, published, in, the, description, de, l, gypte, in, the, 20th, century, the, egyptian, government, and, archaeologists, alike, recognized, the, importance, of, cultural, respect, and, integrity, in, excavations, since, the, 2010s, the, ministry, of, tourism, and, antiquities, has, overseen, excavations, and, the, recovery, of, artifacts
