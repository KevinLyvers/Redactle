prehistoric, egypt, and, predynastic, egypt, was, the, period, of, time, starting, at, the, first, human, settlement, and, ending, at, the, first, dynasty, of, egypt, around, 3100, bc, at, the, end, of, prehistory, predynastic, egypt, is, traditionally, defined, as, the, period, from, the, final, part, of, the, neolithic, period, beginning, c, 6200, bc, to, the, end, of, the, naqada, iii, period, c, 3000, bc, the, dates, of, the, predynastic, period, were, first, defined, before, widespread, archaeological, excavation, of, egypt, took, place, and, recent, finds, indicating, very, gradual, predynastic, development, have, led, to, controversy, over, when, exactly, the, predynastic, period, ended, thus, various, terms, such, as, protodynastic, period, zero, dynasty, or, dynasty, 0, are, used, to, name, the, part, of, the, period, which, might, be, characterized, as, predynastic, by, some, and, early, dynastic, by, others, the, predynastic, period, is, generally, divided, into, cultural, eras, each, named, after, the, place, where, a, certain, type, of, egyptian, settlement, was, first, discovered, however, the, same, gradual, development, that, characterizes, the, protodynastic, period, is, present, throughout, the, entire, predynastic, period, and, individual, cultures, must, not, be, interpreted, as, separate, entities, but, as, largely, subjective, divisions, used, to, facilitate, study, of, the, entire, period, the, vast, majority, of, predynastic, archaeological, finds, have, been, in, upper, egypt, because, the, silt, of, the, nile, river, was, more, heavily, deposited, at, the, delta, region, completely, burying, most, delta, sites, long, before, modern, times, egypt, has, been, inhabited, by, humans, including, archaic, humans, for, over, a, million, and, probably, over, 2, million, years, though, the, evidence, for, early, occupation, of, egypt, is, sparse, and, fragmentary, the, oldest, archaeological, finds, in, egypt, stone, tools, belonging, to, the, oldowan, industry, are, poorly, dated, these, tools, are, succeeded, by, those, belonging, to, the, acheulean, industry, the, youngest, achulean, sites, in, egypt, date, to, around, 400, 300, 000, years, ago, during, the, late, pleistocene, when, egypt, was, occupied, by, modern, humans, several, archaeological, industries, are, recognised, including, the, silsilian, fakhurian, afian, kubbaniyan, idfuan, shuwikhatian, and, the, isnan, industries, some, of, the, oldest, known, structures, were, discovered, in, egypt, by, archaeologist, waldemar, chmielewski, along, the, southern, border, near, wadi, halfa, sudan, at, the, arkin, 8, site, chmielewski, dated, the, structures, to, 100, 000, bc, the, remains, of, the, structures, are, oval, depressions, about, 30, cm, deep, and, 2, 1, meters, across, many, are, lined, with, flat, sandstone, slabs, which, served, as, tent, rings, supporting, a, dome, like, shelter, of, skins, or, brush, this, type, of, dwelling, provided, a, place, to, live, but, if, necessary, could, be, taken, down, easily, and, transported, they, were, mobile, structures, easily, disassembled, moved, and, reassembled, providing, hunter, gatherers, with, semi, permanent, habitation, the, fakhurian, late, paleolithic, industry, in, upper, egypt, showed, that, a, homogenous, population, existed, in, the, nile, valley, during, the, late, pleistocene, studies, of, the, skeletal, material, showed, they, were, in, the, range, of, variation, found, in, the, wadi, halfa, jebel, sahaba, and, fragments, from, the, kom, ombo, populations, aterian, tool, making, reached, egypt, c, 40, 000, bc, the, khormusan, industry, in, egypt, began, between, 42, 000, and, 32, 000, bp, khormusans, developed, tools, not, only, from, stone, but, also, from, animal, bones, and, hematite, they, also, developed, small, arrow, heads, resembling, those, of, native, americans, but, no, bows, have, been, found, the, end, of, the, khormusan, industry, came, around, 16, 000, b, c, with, the, appearance, of, other, cultures, in, the, region, including, the, gemaian, the, late, paleolithic, in, egypt, started, around, 30, 000, bc, the, nazlet, khater, skeleton, was, found, in, 1980, and, given, an, age, of, 33, 000, years, in, 1982, based, on, nine, samples, ranging, between, 35, 100, and, 30, 360, years, old, this, specimen, is, the, only, complete, modern, human, skeleton, from, the, earliest, late, stone, age, in, africa, the, halfan, and, kubbaniyan, two, closely, related, industries, flourished, along, the, upper, nile, valley, halfan, sites, are, found, in, the, far, north, of, sudan, whereas, kubbaniyan, sites, are, found, in, upper, egypt, for, the, halfan, only, four, radiocarbon, dates, have, been, produced, schild, and, wendorf, 2014, discard, the, earliest, and, latest, as, erratic, and, conclude, that, the, halfan, existed, c, 22, 5, 22, 0, ka, cal, bp, people, survived, on, a, diet, of, large, herd, animals, and, the, khormusan, tradition, of, fishing, greater, concentrations, of, artifacts, indicate, that, they, were, not, bound, to, seasonal, wandering, but, settled, for, longer, periods, the, halfan, culture, was, derived, in, turn, from, the, khormusan, which, depended, on, specialized, hunting, fishing, and, collecting, techniques, for, survival, the, primary, material, remains, of, this, culture, are, stone, tools, flakes, and, a, multitude, of, rock, paintings, the, sebilian, culture, began, around, 13, 000, bc, and, vanished, around, 10, 000, bc, in, egypt, analyses, of, pollen, found, at, archaeological, sites, indicate, that, the, people, of, the, sebilian, culture, also, known, as, the, esna, culture, were, gathering, grains, though, domesticated, seeds, were, not, found, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, the, sedentary, lifestyle, practiced, by, these, grain, gatherers, led, to, increased, warfare, which, was, detrimental, to, sedentary, life, and, brought, this, period, to, an, end, the, qadan, culture, 13, 000, 9, 000, bc, was, a, mesolithic, industry, that, archaeological, evidence, suggests, originated, in, upper, egypt, present, day, south, egypt, approximately, 15, 000, years, ago, the, qadan, subsistence, mode, is, estimated, to, have, persisted, for, approximately, 4, 000, years, it, was, characterized, by, hunting, as, well, as, a, unique, approach, to, food, gathering, that, incorporated, the, preparation, and, consumption, of, wild, grasses, and, grains, systematic, efforts, were, made, by, the, qadan, people, to, water, care, for, and, harvest, local, plant, life, but, grains, were, not, planted, in, ordered, rows, around, twenty, archaeological, sites, in, upper, nubia, give, evidence, for, the, existence, of, the, qadan, culture, s, grain, grinding, culture, its, makers, also, practiced, wild, grain, harvesting, along, the, nile, during, the, beginning, of, the, sahaba, daru, nile, phase, when, desiccation, in, the, sahara, caused, residents, of, the, libyan, oases, to, retreat, into, the, nile, valley, among, the, qadan, culture, sites, is, the, jebel, sahaba, cemetery, which, has, been, dated, to, the, mesolithic, qadan, peoples, were, the, first, to, develop, sickles, and, they, also, developed, grinding, stones, independently, to, aid, in, the, collecting, and, processing, of, these, plant, foods, prior, to, consumption, however, there, are, no, indications, of, the, use, of, these, tools, after, 10, 000, bc, when, hunter, gatherers, replaced, them, the, harifians, 8, 800, 8, 000, bc, are, viewed, as, migrating, out, of, the, fayyum, and, the, eastern, deserts, of, egypt, including, sinai, during, the, late, mesolithic, to, merge, with, the, pre, pottery, neolithic, b, ppnb, culture, whose, tool, assemblage, resembles, that, of, the, harifian, this, assimilation, led, to, the, circum, arabian, nomadic, pastoral, complex, a, group, of, cultures, that, invented, nomadic, pastoralism, and, may, have, been, the, original, culture, that, spread, proto, semitic, languages, across, much, of, southwest, asia, the, natural, scientist, frederick, falkenburger, in, 1947, based, on, a, sample, set, of, around, 1, 800, prehistoric, egyptian, crania, noted, great, heterogeneity, amongst, his, samples, falkenburger, categorized, them, based, on, the, nasal, index, overall, head, and, face, form, taking, into, account, width, eye, socket, structure, amongst, other, given, indicators, he, divided, and, characterized, the, skulls, into, four, types, cro, magnon, type, negroid, type, mediterranean, type, and, mixed, types, resulting, from, the, mixture, of, the, aforementioned, groups, similarly, the, craniometrics, of, early, egyptians, were, according, to, the, physician, and, anthropologist, eugene, strouhal, in, 1971, designated, as, either, cro, magnon, of, north, africa, mediterranean, negroid, of, east, africa, and, intermediate, mixed, according, to, professor, fekhri, a, hassan, the, peopling, of, the, egyptian, nile, valley, from, archaeological, and, biological, data, was, the, result, of, a, complex, interaction, between, coastal, northern, africans, neolithic, saharans, nilotic, hunters, and, riverine, proto, nubians, with, some, influence, and, migration, from, the, levant, hassan, 1988, continued, expansion, of, the, desert, forced, the, early, ancestors, of, the, egyptians, to, settle, around, the, nile, more, permanently, and, adopt, a, more, sedentary, lifestyle, during, the, neolithic, the, period, from, 9000, to, 6000, bc, has, left, very, little, in, the, way, of, archaeological, evidence, around, 6200, bc, neolithic, settlements, appear, all, over, egypt, some, studies, based, on, morphological, genetic, and, archaeological, data, have, attributed, these, settlements, to, migrants, from, the, fertile, crescent, in, the, near, east, returning, during, the, egyptian, and, north, african, neolithic, bringing, agriculture, to, the, region, morphological, and, post, cranial, data, has, linked, the, earliest, farming, populations, at, fayum, merimde, and, el, badari, to, near, eastern, populations, the, archaeological, data, also, suggests, that, near, eastern, domesticates, were, incorporated, into, a, pre, existing, foraging, strategy, and, only, slowly, developed, into, a, full, blown, lifestyle, finally, the, names, for, the, near, eastern, domesticates, imported, into, egypt, were, not, sumerian, or, proto, semitic, loan, words, however, some, scholars, have, disputed, this, view, and, cited, linguistic, physical, anthropological, archaeological, and, genetic, data, which, does, not, support, the, hypothesis, of, a, mass, migration, from, the, levantine, during, the, prehistoric, period, according, to, historian, william, stiebling, and, archaeologist, susan, n, helft, this, view, posits, that, the, ancient, egyptians, are, the, same, original, population, group, as, nubians, and, other, saharan, populations, with, some, genetic, input, from, arabian, levantine, north, african, and, indo, european, groups, who, have, known, to, have, settled, in, egypt, during, its, long, history, on, the, other, hand, stiebling, and, helft, acknowledge, that, the, genetic, studies, of, north, african, populations, generally, suggest, a, big, influx, of, near, eastern, populations, during, the, neolithic, period, or, earlier, they, also, added, that, there, have, only, been, a, few, studies, on, ancient, egyptian, dna, to, clarify, these, issues, weaving, is, evidenced, for, the, first, time, during, the, faiyum, a, period, people, of, this, period, unlike, later, egyptians, buried, their, dead, very, close, to, and, sometimes, inside, their, settlements, although, archaeological, sites, reveal, very, little, about, this, time, an, examination, of, the, many, egyptian, words, for, city, provides, a, hypothetical, list, of, causes, of, egyptian, sedentarism, in, upper, egypt, terminology, indicates, trade, protection, of, livestock, high, ground, for, flood, refuge, and, sacred, sites, for, deities, from, about, 5000, to, 4200, bc, the, merimde, culture, so, far, only, known, from, merimde, beni, salama, a, large, settlement, site, at, the, edge, of, the, western, delta, flourished, in, lower, egypt, the, culture, has, strong, connections, to, the, faiyum, a, culture, as, well, as, the, levant, people, lived, in, small, huts, produced, a, simple, undecorated, pottery, and, had, stone, tools, cattle, sheep, goats, and, pigs, were, held, wheat, sorghum, and, barley, were, planted, the, merimde, people, buried, their, dead, within, the, settlement, and, produced, clay, figurines, the, first, life, sized, egyptian, head, made, of, clay, comes, from, merimde, the, el, omari, culture, is, known, from, a, small, settlement, near, modern, cairo, people, seem, to, have, lived, in, huts, but, only, postholes, and, pits, survive, the, pottery, is, undecorated, stone, tools, include, small, flakes, axes, and, sickles, metal, was, not, yet, known, their, sites, were, occupied, from, 4000, bc, to, the, archaic, period, 3, 100, bc, the, maadi, culture, also, called, buto, maadi, culture, is, the, most, important, lower, egyptian, prehistoric, culture, dated, about, 4000, 3500, bc, and, contemporary, with, naqada, i, and, ii, phases, in, upper, egypt, the, culture, is, best, known, from, the, site, maadi, near, cairo, as, well, as, the, site, of, buto, but, is, also, attested, in, many, other, places, in, the, delta, to, the, faiyum, region, this, culture, was, marked, by, development, in, architecture, and, technology, it, also, followed, its, predecessor, cultures, when, it, comes, to, undecorated, ceramics, copper, was, known, and, some, copper, adzes, have, been, found, the, pottery, is, hand, made, it, is, simple, and, undecorated, presence, of, black, topped, red, pots, indicate, contact, with, the, naqada, sites, in, the, south, many, imported, vessels, from, palestine, have, also, been, found, black, basalt, stone, vessels, were, also, used, people, lived, in, small, huts, partly, dug, into, the, ground, the, dead, were, buried, in, cemeteries, but, with, few, burial, goods, the, maadi, culture, was, replaced, by, the, naqada, iii, culture, whether, this, happened, by, conquest, or, infiltration, is, still, an, open, question, the, developments, in, lower, egypt, in, the, times, previous, to, the, unification, of, the, country, have, been, the, subject, of, considerable, disputes, over, the, years, the, recent, excavations, at, tell, el, farkha, sais, and, tell, el, iswid, have, clarified, this, picture, to, some, extent, as, a, result, the, chalcolithic, lower, egyptian, culture, is, now, emerging, as, an, important, subject, of, study, the, tasian, culture, appeared, around, 4500, bc, in, upper, egypt, this, culture, group, is, named, for, the, burials, found, at, der, tasa, on, the, east, bank, of, the, nile, between, asyut, and, akhmim, the, tasian, culture, group, is, notable, for, producing, the, earliest, blacktop, ware, a, type, of, red, and, brown, pottery, that, is, colored, black, on, the, top, portion, and, interior, this, pottery, is, vital, to, the, dating, of, predynastic, egypt, because, all, dates, for, the, predynastic, period, are, tenuous, at, best, wmf, petrie, developed, a, system, called, sequence, dating, by, which, the, relative, date, if, not, the, absolute, date, of, any, given, predynastic, site, can, be, ascertained, by, examining, its, pottery, as, the, predynastic, period, progressed, the, handles, on, pottery, evolved, from, functional, to, ornamental, the, degree, to, which, any, given, archaeological, site, has, functional, or, ornamental, pottery, can, also, be, used, to, determine, the, relative, date, of, the, site, since, there, is, little, difference, between, tasian, ceramics, and, badarian, pottery, the, tasian, culture, overlaps, the, badarian, range, significantly, from, the, tasian, period, onward, it, appears, that, upper, egypt, was, influenced, strongly, by, the, culture, of, lower, egypt, archaeological, evidence, has, suggested, that, the, tasian, and, badarian, nile, valley, sites, were, a, peripheral, network, of, earlier, african, cultures, that, featured, the, movement, of, badarian, saharan, nubian, and, nilotic, populations, bruce, williams, egyptologist, has, argued, that, the, tasian, culture, was, significantly, related, to, the, sudanese, saharan, traditions, from, the, neolithic, era, which, extended, from, regions, north, of, khartoum, to, locations, near, dongola, in, sudan, the, badarian, culture, from, about, 4400, to, 4000, bc, is, named, for, the, badari, site, near, der, tasa, it, followed, the, tasian, culture, but, was, so, similar, that, many, consider, them, one, continuous, period, the, badarian, culture, continued, to, produce, the, kind, of, pottery, called, blacktop, ware, albeit, much, improved, in, quality, and, was, assigned, sequence, dating, numbers, 21, 29, the, primary, difference, that, prevents, scholars, from, merging, the, two, periods, is, that, badarian, sites, use, copper, in, addition, to, stone, and, are, thus, chalcolithic, settlements, while, the, neolithic, tasian, sites, are, still, considered, stone, age, badarian, flint, tools, continued, to, develop, into, sharper, and, more, shapely, blades, and, the, first, faience, was, developed, distinctly, badarian, sites, have, been, located, from, nekhen, to, a, little, north, of, abydos, it, appears, that, the, fayum, a, culture, and, the, badarian, and, tasian, periods, overlapped, significantly, however, the, fayum, a, culture, was, considerably, less, agricultural, and, was, still, neolithic, in, nature, several, biological, anthropological, studies, have, shown, strong, biological, affinities, between, the, badarians, and, other, northeast, african, populations, in, 2005, keita, examined, badarian, crania, from, predynastic, upper, egypt, in, comparison, to, various, european, and, tropical, african, crania, he, found, that, the, predynastic, badarian, series, clustered, much, closer, with, the, tropical, african, series, although, no, asian, or, other, north, african, samples, were, included, in, the, study, as, the, comparative, series, were, selected, based, on, brace, et, al, s, 1993, comments, on, the, affinities, of, an, upper, egyptian, nubian, epipaleolithic, series, keita, further, noted, that, additional, analysis, and, material, from, sudan, late, dynastic, northern, egypt, gizeh, somalia, asia, and, the, pacific, islands, show, the, badarian, series, to, be, most, similar, to, a, series, from, the, northeast, quadrant, of, africa, and, then, to, other, africans, dental, trait, analysis, of, badarian, fossils, conducted, in, a, thesis, study, found, that, they, were, closely, related, to, other, afroasiatic, speaking, populations, inhabiting, northeast, africa, and, the, maghreb, among, the, ancient, populations, the, badarians, were, nearest, to, other, ancient, egyptians, naqada, hierakonpolis, abydos, and, kharga, in, upper, egypt, hawara, in, lower, egypt, and, c, group, and, pharaonic, era, skeletons, excavated, in, lower, nubia, followed, by, the, a, group, culture, bearers, of, lower, nubia, the, kerma, and, kush, populations, in, upper, nubia, the, meroitic, x, group, and, christian, period, inhabitants, of, lower, nubia, and, the, kellis, population, in, the, dakhla, oasis, 219, 20, among, the, recent, groups, the, badari, markers, were, morphologically, closest, to, the, shawia, and, kabyle, berber, populations, of, algeria, as, well, as, bedouin, groups, in, morocco, libya, and, tunisia, followed, by, other, afroasiatic, speaking, populations, in, the, horn, of, africa, 222, 224, the, late, roman, era, badarian, skeletons, from, kellis, were, also, phenotypically, distinct, from, those, belonging, to, other, populations, in, sub, saharan, africa, 231, 32, the, naqada, culture, is, an, archaeological, culture, of, chalcolithic, predynastic, egypt, c, 4000, 3000, bc, named, for, the, town, of, naqada, qena, governorate, it, is, divided, in, three, sub, periods, naqada, i, ii, and, iii, a, number, of, biological, anthropological, studies, have, found, naqada, skeletal, remains, to, have, clear, northeast, african, affinities, in, 1996, lovell, and, prowse, also, reported, the, presence, of, individuals, buried, at, naqada, in, what, they, interpreted, to, be, elite, high, status, tombs, showing, them, to, be, an, endogamous, ruling, or, elite, segment, of, the, local, population, at, naqada, which, is, more, closely, related, to, populations, in, northern, nubia, a, group, than, to, neighbouring, populations, in, southern, egypt, specifically, they, stated, the, naqda, samples, were, more, similar, to, the, lower, nubian, protodynastic, sample, than, they, are, to, the, geographically, more, proximate, southern, egyptian, samples, in, qena, and, badari, however, they, found, the, skeletal, samples, from, the, naqada, cemeteries, to, be, significantly, different, to, protodynastic, populations, in, northern, nubia, and, predynastic, egyptian, samples, from, badari, and, qena, which, were, also, significantly, different, to, northern, nubian, populations, overall, both, the, elite, and, nonelite, individuals, in, the, naqada, cemeteries, were, more, similar, to, each, other, than, they, were, to, the, samples, in, northern, nubia, or, to, samples, from, badari, and, qena, in, southern, egypt, in, 2023, christopher, ehret, reported, that, the, physical, anthropological, findings, from, the, major, burial, sites, of, those, founding, locales, of, ancient, egypt, in, the, fourth, millennium, bce, notably, el, badari, as, well, as, naqada, show, no, demographic, indebtedness, to, the, levant, ehret, specified, that, these, studies, revealed, cranial, and, dental, affinities, with, closest, parallels, to, other, longtime, populations, in, the, surrounding, areas, of, northeastern, africa, such, as, nubia, and, the, northern, horn, of, africa, he, further, commented, that, members, of, this, population, did, not, come, from, somewhere, else, but, were, descendants, of, the, long, term, inhabitants, of, these, portions, of, africa, going, back, many, millennia, ehret, also, cited, existing, archaeological, linguistic, and, genetic, data, which, he, argued, supported, the, demographic, history, the, amratian, culture, lasted, from, about, 4000, to, 3500, bc, it, is, named, after, the, site, of, el, amra, about, 120, km, south, of, badari, el, amra, is, the, first, site, where, this, culture, group, was, found, unmingled, with, the, later, gerzean, culture, group, but, this, period, is, better, attested, at, the, naqada, site, so, it, also, is, referred, to, as, the, naqada, i, culture, black, topped, ware, continues, to, appear, but, white, cross, line, ware, a, type, of, pottery, which, has, been, decorated, with, close, parallel, white, lines, being, crossed, by, another, set, of, close, parallel, white, lines, is, also, found, at, this, time, the, amratian, period, falls, between, s, d, 30, and, 39, in, petrie, s, sequence, dating, system, newly, excavated, objects, attest, to, increased, trade, between, upper, and, lower, egypt, at, this, time, a, stone, vase, from, the, north, was, found, at, el, amra, and, copper, which, is, not, mined, in, egypt, was, imported, from, the, sinai, or, possibly, nubia, obsidian, and, a, small, amount, of, gold, were, both, definitely, imported, from, nubia, trade, with, the, oases, also, was, likely, new, innovations, appeared, in, amratian, settlements, as, precursors, to, later, cultural, periods, for, example, the, mud, brick, buildings, for, which, the, gerzean, period, is, known, were, first, seen, in, amratian, times, but, only, in, small, numbers, additionally, oval, and, theriomorphic, cosmetic, palettes, appear, in, this, period, but, the, workmanship, is, very, rudimentary, and, the, relief, artwork, for, which, they, were, later, known, is, not, yet, present, the, gerzean, culture, from, about, 3500, to, 3200, bc, is, named, after, the, site, of, gerzeh, it, was, the, next, stage, in, egyptian, cultural, development, and, it, was, during, this, time, that, the, foundation, of, dynastic, egypt, was, laid, gerzean, culture, is, largely, an, unbroken, development, out, of, amratian, culture, starting, in, the, delta, and, moving, south, through, upper, egypt, but, failing, to, dislodge, amratian, culture, in, nubia, gerzean, pottery, is, assigned, values, from, s, d, 40, through, 62, and, is, distinctly, different, from, amratian, white, cross, lined, wares, or, black, topped, ware, gerzean, pottery, was, painted, mostly, in, dark, red, with, pictures, of, animals, people, and, ships, as, well, as, geometric, symbols, that, appear, derived, from, animals, also, wavy, handles, rare, before, this, period, though, occasionally, found, as, early, as, s, d, 35, became, more, common, and, more, elaborate, until, they, were, almost, completely, ornamental, gerzean, culture, coincided, with, a, significant, decline, in, rainfall, and, farming, along, the, nile, now, produced, the, vast, majority, of, food, though, contemporary, paintings, indicate, that, hunting, was, not, entirely, forgone, with, increased, food, supplies, egyptians, adopted, a, much, more, sedentary, lifestyle, and, cities, grew, as, large, as, 5, 000, it, was, in, this, time, that, egyptian, city, dwellers, stopped, building, with, reeds, and, began, mass, producing, mud, bricks, first, found, in, the, amratian, period, to, build, their, cities, egyptian, stone, tools, while, still, in, use, moved, from, bifacial, construction, to, ripple, flaked, construction, copper, was, used, for, all, kinds, of, tools, and, the, first, copper, weaponry, appears, here, silver, gold, lapis, and, faience, were, used, ornamentally, and, the, grinding, palettes, used, for, eye, paint, since, the, badarian, period, began, to, be, adorned, with, relief, carvings, the, first, tombs, in, classic, egyptian, style, were, also, built, modeled, after, ordinary, houses, and, sometimes, composed, of, multiple, rooms, although, further, excavations, in, the, delta, are, needed, this, style, is, generally, believed, to, originate, there, and, not, in, upper, egypt, although, the, gerzean, culture, is, now, clearly, identified, as, being, the, continuation, of, the, amratian, period, significant, mesopotamian, influence, worked, its, way, into, egypt, during, the, gerzean, interpreted, in, previous, years, as, evidence, of, a, mesopotamian, ruling, class, the, so, called, dynastic, race, coming, to, power, over, upper, egypt, this, idea, no, longer, attracts, academic, support, distinctly, foreign, objects, and, art, forms, entered, egypt, during, this, period, indicating, contacts, with, several, parts, of, asia, objects, such, as, the, gebel, el, arak, knife, handle, which, has, patently, mesopotamian, relief, carvings, on, it, have, been, found, in, egypt, and, the, silver, which, appears, in, this, period, can, only, have, been, obtained, from, asia, minor, in, addition, egyptian, objects, are, created, which, clearly, mimic, mesopotamian, forms, although, not, slavishly, cylinder, seals, appear, in, egypt, as, well, as, recessed, paneling, architecture, the, egyptian, reliefs, on, cosmetic, palettes, are, clearly, made, in, the, same, style, as, the, contemporary, mesopotamian, uruk, culture, and, the, ceremonial, mace, heads, which, turn, up, from, the, late, gerzean, and, early, semainean, are, crafted, in, the, mesopotamian, pear, shaped, style, instead, of, the, egyptian, native, style, the, route, of, this, trade, is, difficult, to, determine, but, contact, with, canaan, does, not, predate, the, early, dynastic, so, it, is, usually, assumed, to, have, been, conducted, over, water, during, the, time, when, the, dynastic, race, theory, was, still, popular, it, was, theorized, that, uruk, sailors, circumnavigated, arabia, but, a, mediterranean, route, probably, by, middlemen, through, byblos, is, more, likely, as, evidenced, by, the, presence, of, byblian, objects, in, egypt, the, fact, that, so, many, gerzean, sites, are, at, the, mouths, of, wadis, that, lead, to, the, red, sea, may, indicate, some, amount, of, trade, via, the, red, sea, though, byblian, trade, potentially, could, have, crossed, the, sinai, and, then, taken, the, red, sea, also, it, is, considered, unlikely, that, something, so, complicated, as, recessed, panel, architecture, could, have, worked, its, way, into, egypt, by, proxy, and, at, least, a, small, contingent, of, migrants, is, often, suspected, despite, this, evidence, of, foreign, influence, egyptologists, generally, agree, that, the, gerzean, culture, is, still, predominantly, indigenous, to, egypt, the, naqada, iii, period, from, about, 3200, to, 3000, bc, is, generally, taken, to, be, identical, with, the, protodynastic, period, during, which, egypt, was, unified, naqada, iii, is, notable, for, being, the, first, era, with, hieroglyphs, though, this, is, disputed, by, some, the, first, regular, use, of, serekhs, the, first, irrigation, and, the, first, appearance, of, royal, cemeteries, the, relatively, affluent, maadi, suburb, of, cairo, is, built, over, the, original, naqada, stronghold, bioarchaeologist, nancy, lovell, had, stated, that, there, is, a, sufficient, body, of, morphological, evidence, to, indicate, that, ancient, southern, egyptians, had, physical, characteristics, within, the, range, of, variation, of, both, ancient, and, modern, indigenous, peoples, in, the, sahara, and, tropical, africa, she, summarised, that, in, general, the, inhabitants, of, upper, egypt, and, nubia, had, the, greatest, biological, affinity, to, people, of, the, sahara, and, more, southerly, areas, but, exhibited, local, variation, in, an, african, context, lower, nubia, is, located, within, the, borders, of, modern, day, egypt, but, is, south, of, the, border, of, ancient, egypt, which, was, located, at, the, first, cataract, of, the, nile, nabta, playa, was, once, a, large, internally, drained, basin, in, the, nubian, desert, located, approximately, 800, kilometers, south, of, modern, day, cairo, or, about, 100, kilometers, west, of, abu, simbel, in, southern, egypt, 22, 51, north, 30, 73, east, today, the, region, is, characterized, by, numerous, archaeological, sites, the, nabta, playa, archaeological, site, one, of, the, earliest, of, the, egyptian, neolithic, period, is, dated, to, circa, 7500, bc, also, excavations, from, nabta, playa, located, about, 100, km, west, of, abu, simbel, for, example, suggest, that, the, neolithic, inhabitants, of, the, region, included, migrants, from, both, sub, saharan, africa, and, the, mediterranean, area, according, to, christopher, ehret, the, material, cultural, indicators, correspond, with, the, conclusion, that, the, inhabitants, of, the, wider, nabta, playa, region, were, a, nilo, saharan, speaking, population
