was, scheduled, to, sign, a, new, union, treaty, that, would, have, converted, the, soviet, union, into, a, federation, of, independent, republics, with, a, common, president, foreign, policy, and, military, it, was, strongly, supported, by, the, central, asian, republics, which, needed, the, economic, advantages, of, a, common, market, to, prosper, however, it, would, have, meant, some, degree, of, continued, communist, party, control, over, economic, and, social, life, more, radical, reformists, were, increasingly, convinced, that, a, rapid, transition, to, a, market, economy, was, required, even, if, the, eventual, outcome, meant, the, disintegration, of, the, soviet, union, into, several, independent, states, independence, also, accorded, with, yeltsin, s, desires, as, president, of, the, rsfsr, as, well, as, those, of, regional, and, local, authorities, to, get, rid, of, moscow, s, pervasive, control, in, contrast, to, the, reformers, lukewarm, response, to, the, treaty, the, conservatives, patriots, and, russian, nationalists, of, the, ussr, still, strong, within, the, cpsu, and, the, military, were, opposed, to, weakening, the, soviet, state, and, its,

kryuchkov, and, other, senior, officials, acted, to, prevent, the, union, treaty, from, being, signed, by, forming, the, general, committee, on, the, state, emergency, which, put, gorbachev, on, holiday, in, foros, crimea, under, house, arrest, and, cut, off, his, communications, the, coup, leaders, issued, an, emergency, decree, suspending, political, activity, and, banning, most, newspapers, thousands, of, muscovites, came, out, to, defend, the, white, house, the, russian, federation, s, parliament, and, yeltsin, s, office, the, symbolic, seat, of, russian, sovereignty, at, the, time, the, organizers, of, the, coup, tried, but, ultimately, failed, to, arrest, yeltsin, who, rallied, opposition, to, the, coup, by, making, speeches, from, atop, a, tank, the, special, forces, dispatched, by, the, coup, leaders, took, up, positions, near, the, white, house, but, members, refused, to, storm, the, barricaded, building, the, coup, leaders, also, neglected, to, jam, foreign, news, broadcasts, so, many, muscovites, watched, it, unfold, live, on, cnn, even, the, isolated, gorbachev, was, able, to, stay, abreast, of, developments, by, tuning, into, the, bbc, world, service, on, a, small, transistor, radio, after, three, days, on, 21, august, 1991, the, coup, collapsed, the, organizers, were, detained, and, gorbachev, was, reinstated, as, president, albeit, with, his, power, much, depleted, on, 24, august, 1991, gorbachev, resigned, as, general, secretary, of, the, cpsu, and, dissolved, all, party, units, in, the, government, on, the, same, day, the, supreme, soviet, of, the, ukrainian, ssr, passed, a, declaration, of, independence, of, ukraine, calling, for, a, national, referendum, on, the, independence, of, ukraine, from, the, soviet, union, five, days, later, the, supreme, soviet, of, the, soviet, union, indefinitely, suspended, all, cpsu, activity, on, soviet, territory, effectively, ending, communist, rule, in, the, soviet, union, and, dissolving, the, only, remaining, unifying, force, in, the, country, gorbachev, established, a, state, council, of, the, soviet, union, on, 5, september, designed, to, bring, him, and, the, highest, officials, of, the, remaining, republics, into, a, collective, leadership, the, state, council, was, also, empowered, to, appoint, a, premier, of, the, soviet, union, the, premiership, never, functioned, properly, though, ivan, silayev, de, facto, took, the, post, through, the, committee, on, the, operational, management, of, the, soviet, economy, and, the, inter, republican, economic, committee, and, tried, to, form, a, government, though, with, rapidly, shrinking, powers, the, soviet, union, collapsed, with, dramatic, speed, in, the, last, quarter, of, 1991, between, august, and, december, 10, republics, seceded, from, the, union, largely, out, of, fear, of, another, coup, by, the, end, of, september, gorbachev, no, longer, had, the, ability, to, influence, events, outside, of, moscow, he, was, challenged, even, there, by, yeltsin, who, had, begun, taking, over, what, remained, of, the, soviet, government, including, the, kremlin, the, soviet, union, recognized, the, independence, of, baltic, republics, on, 6, september, 1991, georgia, cut, all, ties, with, the, soviet, union, on, 7, september, citing, the, failure, to, receive, a, sufficiently, grounded, answer, why, the, ussr, did, not, recognise, its, independence, when, it, had, recognised, the, baltic, states, secession, on, 17, september, 1991, general, assembly, resolution, numbers, 46, 4, 46, 5, and, 46, 6, admitted, estonia, latvia, and, lithuania, to, the, united, nations, conforming, to, security, council, resolution, numbers, 709, 710, and, 711, passed, on, 12, september, without, a, vote, on, 6, november, yeltsin, who, had, by, then, taken, over, much, of, the, soviet, government, issued, a, decree, banning, all, communist, party, activities, on, russian, territory, by, 7, november, 1991, most, newspapers, referred, to, the, former, soviet, union, the, final, round, of, the, soviet, union, s, collapse, began, on, 1, december, 1991, that, day, a, ukrainian, popular, referendum, resulted, in, 91, percent, of, ukraine, s, voters, voting, to, affirm, the, independence, declaration, passed, in, august, and, formally, secede, from, the, union, the, secession, of, ukraine, long, second, only, to, russia, in, economic, and, political, power, ended, any, realistic, chance, of, gorbachev, keeping, the, soviet, union, together, even, on, a, limited, scale, the, leaders, of, the, three, slavic, republics, russia, ukraine, and, belarus, formerly, byelorussia, agreed, to, discuss, possible, alternatives, to, the, union, on, 8, december, the, leaders, of, russia, ukraine, and, belarus, secretly, met, in, belavezhskaya, pushcha, in, western, belarus, and, signed, the, belavezha, accords, which, proclaimed, the, soviet, union, had, ceased, to, exist, and, announced, formation, of, the, commonwealth, of, independent, states, cis, as, a, looser, association, to, take, its, place, they, also, invited, other, republics, to, join, the, cis, gorbachev, called, it, an, unconstitutional, coup, however, by, this, time, there, was, no, longer, any, reasonable, doubt, that, as, the, preamble, of, the, accords, put, it, that, the, soviet, union, no, longer, existed, as, a, subject, of, international, law, and, a, geopolitical, reality, on, 10, december, the, agreement, was, ratified, by, the, verkhovna, rada, of, ukraine, and, the, supreme, council, of, belarus, on, 12, december, the, supreme, soviet, of, the, russian, sfsr, formally, ratified, the, belavezha, accords, denounced, the, 1922, union, treaty, and, recalled, the, russian, deputies, from, the, supreme, soviet, of, the, ussr, the, legality, of, this, ratification, raised, doubts, among, some, members, of, the, russian, parliament, since, according, to, the, 1978, rsfsr, constitution, consideration, of, this, document, was, in, the, exclusive, jurisdiction, of, the, congress, of, people, s, deputies, of, the, rsfsr, additionally, the, soviet, constitution, did, not, allow, a, republic, to, unilaterally, recall, its, deputies, however, no, one, in, either, russia, or, the, kremlin, objected, any, objections, from, the, latter, would, have, likely, had, no, effect, since, what, was, left, of, the, soviet, government, had, effectively, been, rendered, impotent, long, before, december, a, number, of, lawyers, believe, that, the, denunciation, of, the, union, treaty, was, meaningless, since, it, became, invalid, in, 1924, with, the, adoption, of, the, first, constitution, of, the, ussr, in, 1996, the, state, duma, had, voiced, the, same, position, later, that, day, gorbachev, hinted, for, the, first, time, that, he, was, considering, stepping, down, on, the, surface, it, appeared, that, the, largest, republic, had, formally, seceded, however, this, is, not, the, case, rather, russia, apparently, took, the, line, that, it, did, not, need, to, follow, the, secession, process, delineated, in, the, soviet, constitution, because, it, was, not, possible, to, secede, from, a, country, that, no, longer, existed, on, 16, december, 1991, the, kazakh, ssr, became, the, last, republic, to, formally, secede, from, the, soviet, union, causing, the, soviet, union, to, neither, control, any, territory, nor, claim, to, control, any, territory, although, soviet, embassies, still, existed, on, 17, december, 1991, along, with, 28, european, countries, the, european, economic, community, and, four, non, european, countries, the, three, baltic, republics, and, nine, of, the, twelve, remaining, soviet, republics, signed, the, european, energy, charter, in, the, hague, as, sovereign, states, on, the, same, day, members, of, the, lower, house, of, the, union, parliament, council, of, the, union, held, a, meeting, of, people, s, deputies, of, the, soviet, union, the, meeting, adopted, a, statement, in, connection, with, the, signing, of, the, belovezhskaya, agreement, and, its, ratification, by, the, parliaments, of, russia, belarus, and, ukraine, in, which, it, noted, that, it, considers, the, decisions, made, on, the, liquidation, of, state, power, and, administration, bodies, illegal, and, not, meeting, the, current, situation, and, the, vital, interests, of, the, peoples, and, stated, that, in, the, event, further, complication, of, the, situation, in, the, country, reserves, the, right, to, convene, in, the, future, the, congress, of, people, s, deputies, of, the, ussr, on, 18, december, the, upper, chamber, of, the, supreme, soviet, of, the, ussr, council, of, republics, adopted, a, statement, according, to, which, it, accepts, with, understanding, the, agreement, on, the, creation, of, the, commonwealth, of, independent, states, and, considers, it, a, real, guarantee, of, a, way, out, of, the, acute, political, and, economic, crisis, gorbachev, met, with, yeltsin, and, accepted, the, fait, accompli, of, the, soviet, union, s, dissolution, on, the, same, day, the, supreme, soviet, of, the, russian, sfsr, adopted, a, statute, to, change, russia, s, legal, name, from, russian, soviet, federative, socialist, republic, to, russian, federation, showing, that, it, was, now, a, fully, sovereign, non, communist, state, doubts, remained, over, whether, the, belavezha, accords, had, legally, dissolved, the, soviet, union, since, they, were, signed, by, only, three, republics, however, on, 21, december, representatives, of, 11, of, the, 12, remaining, republics, all, except, georgia, signed, the, alma, ata, protocol, which, confirmed, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, and, formally, established, the, cis, they, also, accepted, gorbachev, s, resignation, the, command, of, the, armed, forces, of, the, ussr, was, entrusted, to, the, minister, of, defense, yevgeny, shaposhnikov, even, at, this, moment, gorbachev, had, not, made, any, formal, plans, to, leave, the, scene, yet, however, with, a, majority, of, republics, now, agreeing, that, the, soviet, union, no, longer, existed, gorbachev, bowed, to, the, inevitable, telling, cbs, news, that, he, would, resign, as, soon, as, he, saw, that, the, cis, was, indeed, a, reality, in, a, nationally, televised, speech, in, the, evening, of, 25, december, gorbachev, resigned, as, president, of, the, soviet, union, or, as, he, put, it, i, hereby, discontinue, my, activities, at, the, post, of, president, of, the, union, of, soviet, socialist, republics, he, declared, the, office, extinct, and, ceded, all, of, its, powers, such, as, control, of, the, nuclear, arsenal, to, yeltsin, on, the, night, of, 25, december, at, 7, 35, p, m, moscow, time, after, gorbachev, appeared, on, television, the, soviet, flag, was, lowered, the, state, anthem, of, the, soviet, union, was, played, for, the, last, time, the, tune, itself, returned, in, december, 2000, thanks, to, the, support, of, yeltsin, s, successor, vladimir, putin, but, with, new, lyrics, selected, to, evoke, and, eulogize, the, history, and, traditions, of, russia, and, the, russian, tricolor, was, raised, in, its, place, at, 7, 45, pm, symbolically, marking, the, end, of, the, soviet, union, in, his, parting, words, gorbachev, defended, his, record, on, domestic, reform, and, d, tente, but, conceded, the, old, system, collapsed, before, a, new, one, had, time, to, start, working, on, that, same, day, the, president, of, the, united, states, george, h, w, bush, held, a, brief, televised, speech, officially, recognizing, the, independence, of, the, 11, remaining, republics, gorbachev, s, speech, as, well, as, the, replacement, of, the, soviet, flag, with, the, russian, flag, symbolically, marked, the, end, of, the, soviet, union, however, the, final, legal, step, in, the, soviet, union, s, demise, came, on, 26, december, when, the, soviet, of, the, republics, the, upper, chamber, of, the, supreme, soviet, of, the, soviet, union, ratified, the, belavezha, accords, effectively, voting, the, soviet, union, out, of, existence, the, lower, chamber, the, soviet, of, the, union, had, been, unable, to, work, since, 12, december, when, the, recall, of, the, russian, deputies, left, it, without, a, quorum, the, following, day, yeltsin, moved, into, gorbachev, s, former, office, though, the, russian, authorities, had, taken, over, the, suite, two, days, earlier, the, soviet, armed, forces, were, placed, under, the, command, of, the, commonwealth, of, independent, states, but, were, eventually, subsumed, by, the, newly, independent, republics, with, the, bulk, becoming, the, armed, forces, of, the, russian, federation, by, the, end, of, 1991, the, few, remaining, soviet, institutions, that, had, not, been, taken, over, by, russia, ceased, operation, and, individual, republics, assumed, the, central, government, s, role, other, issues, were, also, addressed, at, alma, ata, on, 21, december, 1991, including, un, membership, in, a, document, additional, to, the, main, alma, ata, declaration, russia, was, authorized, to, assume, the, soviet, union, s, un, membership, including, its, permanent, seat, on, the, security, council, the, soviet, ambassador, to, the, un, delivered, a, letter, signed, by, russian, president, yeltsin, to, the, un, secretary, general, dated, 24, december, 1991, informing, him, that, with, the, support, of, the, countries, of, the, commonwealth, of, independent, states, russia, was, the, successor, state, to, the, ussr, after, being, circulated, among, the, other, un, member, states, russia, attended, the, un, security, council, meeting, on, the, last, day, of, the, year, 31, december, 1991, with, no, objection, raised, but, questions, of, state, succession, settlement, of, external, debt, and, division, of, assets, abroad, remain, disputed, between, russia, and, ukraine, to, this, day, in, april, 1992, the, congress, of, people, s, deputies, of, russia, refused, to, ratify, the, belovezhskaya, agreements, and, to, exclude, references, to, the, constitution, and, laws, of, the, ussr, from, the, text, of, the, constitution, of, the, rsfsr, according, to, some, russian, politicians, this, was, one, of, the, reasons, for, the, political, crisis, of, september, october, 1993, in, a, referendum, on, 12, december, 1993, a, new, russian, constitution, was, adopted, in, which, there, was, no, mention, of, the, union, state, in, the, decades, following, the, end, of, the, cold, war, only, five, or, six, of, the, post, soviet, states, are, on, a, path, to, joining, the, wealthy, capitalist, states, of, the, west, and, most, are, falling, behind, some, to, such, an, extent, that, over, 50, years, will, be, needed, before, they, catch, up, to, how, they, were, before, the, end, of, communism, however, virtually, all, the, former, soviet, republics, were, able, to, turn, their, economies, around, and, increase, gdp, to, multiple, times, what, it, was, under, the, ussr, in, a, 2001, study, by, the, economist, steven, rosefielde, he, calculated, that, there, were, 3, 4, million, premature, deaths, in, russia, from, 1990, to, 1998, which, he, partly, blames, on, the, shock, therapy, that, came, with, the, washington, consensus, nearly, all, of, the, post, soviet, states, suffered, deep, and, prolonged, recessions, after, shock, therapy, with, poverty, increasing, more, than, tenfold, catastrophic, drops, in, caloric, intake, followed, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, according, to, the, scholar, marcel, h, van, herpen, the, end, of, the, soviet, union, marked, the, end, of, the, last, european, empire, and, some, authors, called, it, the, death, of, russian, colonialism, and, imperialism, as, the, soviet, union, began, to, collapse, social, disintegration, and, political, instability, fueled, a, surge, in, ethnic, conflict, social, and, economic, disparities, along, with, ethnic, differences, created, an, upsurge, in, nationalism, within, groups, and, discrimination, between, groups, in, particular, disputes, over, territorial, boundaries, have, been, the, source, of, conflict, between, states, experiencing, political, transition, and, upheaval, territorial, conflicts, can, involve, several, different, issues, the, reunification, of, ethnic, groups, which, have, been, separated, restoration, of, territorial, rights, to, those, who, experienced, forced, deportation, and, restoration, of, boundaries, arbitrarily, changed, during, the, soviet, era, territorial, disputes, remain, significant, points, of, controversy, as, minority, groups, consistently, oppose, election, outcomes, and, seek, autonomy, and, self, determination, in, addition, to, territorial, disputes, and, other, structural, causes, of, conflict, legacies, from, the, soviet, and, pre, soviet, eras, along, with, the, suddenness, of, the, actual, sociopolitical, change, have, resulted, in, conflict, throughout, the, region, as, each, group, experiences, dramatic, economic, reform, and, political, democratization, there, has, been, a, surge, in, nationalism, and, interethnic, conflict, overall, the, fifteen, independent, states, that, emerged, after, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, face, problems, stemming, from, uncertain, identities, contested, boundaries, apprehensive, minorities, and, an, overbearing, russian, hegemony, after, decades, of, hardship, following, the, sino, soviet, split, the, people, s, republic, of, china, entered, a, gradual, rapprochement, with, the, soviet, union, in, 1989, when, gorbachev, visited, the, country, afterwards, the, border, treaty, was, demarcated, in, 1991, and, they, signed, the, treaty, of, good, neighborliness, and, friendly, cooperation, in, 2001, which, was, renewed, in, june, 2021, for, five, more, years, both, countries, are, members, of,

other, on, various, global, issues, commentators, have, debated, whether, the, bilateral, strategic, partnership, constitutes, an, alliance, russia, and, china, officially, declared, their, relations, not, allies, but, better, than, allies, the, relations, between, the, two, countries, are, currently, being, put, to, the, test, after, russia, invading, ukraine, unlike, in, the, soviet, era, putin,

crisis, in, cuba, that, began, in, 1991, it, was, defined, primarily, by, extreme, reductions, of, rationed, foods, at, state, subsidized, prices, the, severe, shortages, of, hydrocarbon, energy, resources, in, the, form, of, gasoline, diesel, and, other, petroleum, derivatives, that, occurred, upon, the, implosion, of, economic, agreements, between, the, petroleum, rich, soviet, union, and, cuba, and, the, shrinking, of, an, economy, overdependent, on, soviet, imports, during, its, existence, the, soviet, union, provided, cuba, with, large, amounts, of, oil, food, and, machinery, in, the, years, following, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, cuba, s, gross, domestic, product, shrunk, 35, imports, and, exports, both, fell, over, 80, and, many, domestic, industries, shrank, considerably, in, a, speculated, attempt, to, re, join, the, imf, and, the, world, bank, executive, director, jacques, de, groote, and, another, imf, official, were, invited, to, havana, in, late, 1993, after, assessing, the, economic, situation, in, the, country, they, concluded, that, from, 1989, to, 1993, cuba, s, economic, decline, was, more, grave, than, that, experienced, by, any, other, socialist, eastern, european, country, in, 1993, a, series, of, economic, reforms, began, to, go, into, effect, initially, enacted, to, offset, the, economic, imbalances, which, was, a, result, of, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, the, main, aspect, of, these, reforms, was, to, legalize, the, then, illegal, u, s, dollar, and, regulate, its, usage, in, the, island, s, economy, in, 1991, when, the, soviet, union, dissolved, it, ended, all, aid, and, trade, concessions, such, as, cheap, oil, to, north, korea, without, soviet, aid, the, flow, of, imports, to, the, north, korean, agricultural, sector, ended, and, the, government, proved, to, be, too, inflexible, to, respond, energy, imports, fell, by, 75, the, economy, went, into, a, downward, spiral, with, imports, and, exports, falling, in, tandem, flooded, coal, mines, required, electricity, to, operate, pumps, and, the, shortage, of, coal, worsened, the, shortage, of, electricity, agriculture, reliant, on, electrically, powered, irrigation, systems, artificial, fertilizers, and, pesticides, was, hit, particularly, hard, by, the, economic, collapse, between, 1989, and, 2006, about, 1, 6, million, soviet, jews, and, their, non, jewish, spouses, and, their, relatives, as, defined, by, the, law, of, return, emigrated, from, the, former, soviet, union, about, 979, 000, or, 61, migrated, to, israel, as, the, soviet, union, began, to, disintegrate, it, also, lost, support, to, mohammad, najibullah, s, regime, in, afghanistan, following, the, withdrawal, in, 1989, the, end, of, soviet, war, in, afghanistan, would, lead, into, a, continuing, multi, sided, civil, war, only, for, the, taliban, to, rise, in, 1996, because, of, this, u, s, policies, in, the, war, are, also, thought, to, have, contributed, to, a, blowback, of, unintended, consequences, against, american, interests, which, led, to, the, united, states, entering, into, its, own, war, in, afghanistan, following, the, september, 11, attacks, in, 2001, only, to, end, with, the, us, withdrawal, in, 2021, and, the, taliban, regaining, control, of, afghanistan, the, breakup, of, the, soviet, union, saw, a, massive,

poll, showed, that, 66, of, russians, lamented, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, in, 2005, russian, president, vladimir, putin, called, the, dissolution, of, the, ussr, as, the, greatest, geopolitical, catastrophe, of, the, 20th, century, in, a, similar, poll, held, in, february, 2005, 50, of, respondents, in, ukraine, stated, they, regretted, the, disintegration, of, the, soviet,

however, a, similar, poll, conducted, in, 2016, by, a, ukrainian, group, showed, only, 35, ukrainians, regretting, the, soviet, collapse, and, 50, not, regretting, it, the, breakdown, of, economic, ties, that, followed, the, soviet, collapse, led, to, a, severe, economic, crisis, and, catastrophic, fall, in, the, standard, of, living, in, post, soviet, states, and, the, former, eastern, bloc, which, was, even, worse, than, the, great, depression, an, estimated, seven, million, premature, deaths, took, place, in, the, former, ussr, after, it, collapsed, with, around, four, million, in, russia, alone, poverty, and, economic, inequality, surged, between, 1988, and, 1989, and, between, 1993, and, 1995, with, the, gini, ratio, increasing, by, an, average, of, 9, points, for, all, former, socialist, countries, even, before, the, 1998, russian, financial, crisis, the, russian, gdp, was, half, of, what, it, had, been, in, the, early, 1990s, by, 1999, around, 191, million, people,

president, richard, nixon, s, grandchildren, would, live, under, communism, and, nixon, claimed, that, khrushchev, s, grandchildren, would, live, under, freedom, in, a, 1992, interview, nixon, commented, that, during, the, debate, he, was, sure, khrushchev, s, claim, was, wrong, but, nixon, was, not, sure, that, his, own, assertion, was, correct, nixon, said, that, events, had, proved, that, he, was, indeed, right, because, khrushchev, s, grandchildren, now, lived, in, freedom, in, reference, to, the, recent, end, of, the, soviet, union, khrushchev, s, son, sergei, khrushchev, became, a, naturalized, american, citizen, in, a, letter, dated, 24, december, 1991, boris, yeltsin, the, russian, president, informed, the, united, nations, secretary, general, that, the, membership, of, the, soviet, union, in, the, security, council, and, all, other, un, organs, would, be, continued, by, the, russian, federation, with, the, support, of, the, 11, member, countries, of, the, commonwealth, of, independent, states, however, the, byelorussian, soviet, socialist, republic, and, the, ukrainian, soviet, socialist, republic, had, already, joined, the, un, as, original, members, on, 24, october, 1945, together, with, the, soviet, union, after, declaring, independence, the, ukrainian, soviet, socialist, republic, changed, its, name, to, ukraine, on, 24, august, 1991, and, on, 19, september, the, byelorussian, soviet, socialist, republic, informed, the, un, that, it, had, changed, its, name, to, the, republic, of, belarus, all, of, the, twelve, other, independent, states, that, were, established, from, the, former, soviet, republics, were, admitted, to, the, un, historiography, on, the, soviet, collapse, can, be, roughly, classified, in, two, groups, intentionalist, accounts, and, structuralist, accounts, the, end, of, the, soviet, union, caught, many, people, by, surprise, before, 1991, many, thought, that, soviet, collapse, was, impossible, or, unlikely, intentionalist, accounts, contend, that, soviet, collapse, was, not, inevitable, and, resulted, from, the, policies, and, decisions, of, specific, individuals, usually, gorbachev, and, yeltsin, one, characteristic, example, of, intentionalist, writing, is, the, historian, archie, brown, s, the, gorbachev, factor, which, argues, gorbachev, was, the, main, force, in, soviet, politics, at, least, from, 1985, to, 1988, and, even, later, and, that, he, largely, spearheaded, the, political, reforms, and, developments, as, opposed, to, being, led, by, events, that, was, especially, true, of, the, policies, of, perestroika, and, glasnost, market, initiatives, and, foreign, policy, stance, as, the, political, scientist, george, breslauer, has, seconded, by, labelling, gorbachev, a, man, of, the, events, in, a, slightly, different, vein, david, kotz, and, fred, weir, have, contended, that, soviet, elites, were, responsible, for, spurring, on, both, nationalism, and, capitalism, from, which, they, could, personally, benefit, which, is, demonstrated, also, by, their, continued, presence, in, the, higher, economic, and, political, echelons, of, post, soviet, republics, in, contrast, structuralist, accounts, take, a, more, deterministic, view, in, which, soviet, dissolution, was, an, outcome, of, deeply, rooted, structural, issues, which, planted, a, time, bomb, for, example, edward, walker, has, argued, that, minority, nationalities, were, denied, power, at, the, union, level, confronted, by, a, culturally, destabilizing, form, of, economic, modernization, and, subjected, to, a, certain, amount, of, russification, but, they, were, at, the, same, time, strengthened, by, several, policies, pursued, by, the, soviet, government, indigenization, of, leadership, support, for, local, languages, etc, over, time, they, created, conscious, nations, furthermore, the, basic, legitimating, myth, of, the, soviet, federative, system, that, it, was, a, voluntary, and, mutual, union, of, allied, peoples, eased, the, task, of, secession, and, independence, on, 25, january, 2016, russian, president, vladimir, putin, supported, that, view, by, calling, lenin, s, support, of, the, right, of, secession, for, the, soviet, republics, a, delayed, action, bomb, an, opinion, piece, by, gorbachev, in, april, 2006, stated, the, nuclear, meltdown, at, chernobyl, 20, years, ago, this, month, even, more, than, my, launch, of, perestroika, was, perhaps, the, real, cause, of, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, it, also, had, a, profound, impact, on, the, policy, making, circles, of, the, chinese, communist, party, ccp, in, particular, on, ccp, general, secretary, xi, jinping, who, states, why, did, the, soviet, union, disintegrate, why, did, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, fall, from, power, an, important, reason, was, that, the, struggle, in, the, field, of, ideology, was, extremely, intense, completely, negating, the, history, of, the, soviet, union, negating, the, history, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, negating, lenin, negating, stalin, creating, historical, nihilism, and, confused, thinking, party, organs, at, all, levels, had, lost, their, functions, the, military, was, no, longer, under, party, leadership, in, the, end, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, a, great, party, was, scattered, the, soviet, union, a, great, socialist, country, disintegrated, this, is, a, cautionary, tale, according, to, political, scientists, steven, levitsky, and, lucan, way, in, their, book, in, revolution, and, dictatorship, the, violent, origins, of, durable, authoritarianism, 2022, the, cohesion, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, cpsu, leadership, had, declined, by, the, 1980s, most,
