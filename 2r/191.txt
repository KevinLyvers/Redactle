established, a, bond, legally, as, strong, as, that, of, kinship, because, of, this, all, but, the, first, and, last, of, the, nerva, antonine, emperors, are, called, adoptive, emperors, the, importance, of, official, adoption, in, roman, society, has, often, been, considered, a, conscious, repudiation, of, the, principle, of, dynastic, inheritance, and, has, been, deemed, one, of, the, factors, of, the, period, s, prosperity, however, this, was, not, a, new, practice, it, was, common, for, patrician, families, to, adopt, and, roman, emperors, had, adopted, heirs, in, the, past, the, emperor, augustus, had, adopted, tiberius, and, the, emperor, claudius, had, adopted, nero, julius, caesar, dictator, perpetuo, and, considered, to, be, instrumental, in, the, transition, from,

was, considered, to, be, an, unfortunate, choice, and, the, beginning, of, the, empire, s, decline, with, the, murder, of, commodus, in, 192, the, nerva, antonine, dynasty, came, to, an, end, it, was, followed, by, a, brief, period, of, turbulence, known, as, the, year, of, the, five, emperors, which, ended, with, the, establishment, of, the, new, severan, dynasty, nerva, was, the, first, of, the, dynasty, though, his, reign, was, short, it, saw, a, partial, reconciliation, between, the, army, the, senate, and, the, commoners, nerva, adopted, as, his, son, the, popular, military, leader, trajan, in, turn, hadrian, succeeded, trajan, he, had, been, the, latter, s, heir, presumptive, and, averred, that, he, had, been, adopted, by, him, on, trajan, s, deathbed, the, antonines, are, four,

consolidation, of, the, empire, the, emperor, hadrian, named, antoninus, pius, his, son, and, heir, under, the, condition, that, he, adopt, both, marcus, aurelius, and, lucius, verus, hadrian, died, that, same, year, and, antoninus, began, a, peaceful, benevolent, reign, he, adhered, strictly, to, roman, traditions, and, institutions, and, shared, his, power, with, the, roman, senate, marcus, aurelius, and, lucius, verus, succeeded, antoninus, pius, in, 161, upon, that, emperor, s, death, and, co, ruled, until, verus, death, in, 169, marcus, continued, the, antonine, legacy, after, verus, death, as, an, unpretentious, and, gifted, administrator, and, leader, he, died, in, 180, and, was, followed, by, his, biological, son, commodus, the, rulers, commonly, known, as, the, five, good, emperors, were, nerva, trajan, hadrian, antoninus, pius, and, marcus, aurelius, the, term, was, coined, by, niccol, machiavelli, in, his, posthumously, published, book, the, discourses, on, livy, from, 1531, from, the, study, of, this, history, we, may, also, learn, how, a, good, government, is, to, be, established, for, while, all, the, emperors, who, succeeded, to, the, throne, by, birth, except, titus, were, bad, all, were, good, who, succeeded, by, adoption, as, in, the, case, of, the, five, from, nerva, to, marcus, but, as, soon, as, the, empire, fell, once, more, to, the, heirs, by, birth, its, ruin, recommenced, machiavelli, argued, that, these, adopted, emperors, earned, the, respect, of, those, around, them, through, good, governance, titus, nerva, trajan, hadrian, antoninus, and, marcus, had, no, need, of, praetorian, cohorts, or, of, countless, legions, to, guard, them, but, were, defended, by, their, own, good, lives, the, good, will, of, their, subjects, and, the, attachment, of, the, senate, edward, gibbon, wrote, in, the, history, of, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, that, their, rule, was, a, time, when, the, roman, empire, was, governed, by, absolute, power, under, the, guidance, of, wisdom, and, virtue, gibbon, believed, that, these, benevolent, monarchs, and, their, moderate, policies, were, unusual, and, contrasted, with, their, more, tyrannical, and, oppressive, successors, one, hypothesis, posits, that, adoptive, succession, arose, because, of, a, lack, of, biological, heirs, all, but, the, last, of, the, adoptive, emperors, had, no, legitimate, biological, sons, to, succeed, them, they, were, therefore, obliged, to, pick, a, successor, somewhere, else, as, soon, as, the, emperor, could, look, towards, a, biological, son, to, succeed, him, adoptive, succession, was, set, aside, the, dynasty, may, be, broken, up, into, the, nerva, trajan, dynasty, also, called, the, ulpian, dynasty, after, trajan, s, gentile, name, ulpius, and, antonine, dynasty, after, their, common, name, antoninus, except, where, otherwise, noted, the, notes, below, indicate, that, an, individual, s, parentage, is, as, shown,
