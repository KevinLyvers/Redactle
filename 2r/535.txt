ongoing, partial, normalization, the, arab, israeli, conflict, is, the, phenomenon, involving, political, tension, military, conflicts, and, other, disputes, between, various, arab, countries, and, israel, which, escalated, during, the, 20th, century, the, roots, of, the, arab, israeli, conflict, have, been, attributed, to, the, support, by, arab, league, member, countries, for, the, palestinians, a, fellow, league, member, in, the, ongoing, israeli, palestinian, conflict, this, in, turn, has, been, attributed, to, the, simultaneous, rise, of, zionism, and, arab, nationalism, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, though, the, two, national, movements, had, not, clashed, until, the, 1920s, part, of, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, arose, from, the, conflicting, claims, by, these, movements, to, the, land, that, formed, the, british, mandatory, palestine, which, was, regarded, by, the, jewish, people, as, their, ancestral, homeland, while, at, the, same, time, it, was, regarded, by, the, pan, arab, movement, as, historically, and, currently, belonging, to, the, palestinian, arabs, and, in, the, pan, islamic, context, as, muslim, lands, the, sectarian, conflict, within, the, british, mandate, territory, between, palestinian, jews, and, arabs, escalated, into, a, full, scale, palestinian, civil, war, in, 1947, taking, the, side, of, the, palestinian, arabs, especially, following, the, israeli, declaration, of, independence, the, neighbouring, arab, countries, invaded, the, by, then, former, mandate, territory, in, may, 1948, commencing, the, first, arab, israeli, war, large, scale, hostilities, mostly, ended, with, ceasefire, agreements, after, the, 1973, yom, kippur, war, peace, agreements, were, signed, between, israel, and, egypt, in, 1979, resulting, in, israeli, withdrawal, from, the, sinai, peninsula, and, the, abolition, of, the, military, governance, system, in, the, west, bank, and, gaza, strip, in, favor, of, israeli, civil, administration, and, consequent, unilateral, annexation, of, the, golan, heights, and, east, jerusalem, the, nature, of, the, conflict, has, shifted, over, the, years, from, the, large, scale, regional, arab, israeli, conflict, to, a, more, local, israeli, palestinian, conflict, which, peaked, during, the, 1982, lebanon, war, when, israel, intervened, in, the, lebanese, civil, war, to, oust, the, palestinian, liberation, organization, from, lebanon, with, the, decline, of, the, 1987, 1993, first, intifada, the, interim, oslo, accords, led, to, the, creation, of, the, palestinian, national, authority, in, 1994, within, the, context, of, the, israeli, palestinian, peace, process, the, same, year, israel, and, jordan, reached, a, peace, accord, in, 2002, the, arab, league, offered, recognition, of, israel, by, arab, countries, as, part, of, the, resolution, of, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, in, the, arab, peace, initiative, the, initiative, which, has, been, reconfirmed, since, calls, for, normalizing, relations, between, the, arab, league, and, israel, in, exchange, for, a, full, withdrawal, by, israel, from, the, occupied, territories, including, east, jerusalem, and, a, just, settlement, of, the, palestinian, refugee, problem, based, on, un, resolution, 194, in, the, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, a, ceasefire, had, been, largely, maintained, between, israel, and, syria, while, limited, warfare, continued, in, lebanon, against, iranian, proxy, militias, despite, the, peace, agreements, with, egypt, and, jordan, the, interim, peace, accords, with, the, palestinian, authority, and, the, generally, existing, ceasefire, until, the, mid, 2010s, the, arab, league, and, israel, had, remained, at, odds, with, each, other, over, many, issues, among, arab, belligerents, in, the, conflict, iraq, and, syria, are, the, only, states, who, have, reached, no, formal, peace, accord, or, treaty, with, israel, with, both, supporting, iran, the, syrian, civil, war, reshuffled, the, situation, near, israel, s, northern, border, putting, the, syrian, arab, republic, hezbollah, and, the, syrian, opposition, at, odds, with, each, other, and, complicating, their, relations, with, israel, upon, the, emerging, warfare, with, iran, the, conflict, between, israel, and, hamas, ruled, gaza, is, also, attributed, to, the, iran, israel, proxy, conflict, by, 2017, israel, and, several, arab, sunni, states, led, by, saudi, arabia, formed, a, semi, official, coalition, to, confront, iran, this, move, and, the, israeli, normalization, with, gulf, states, was, marked, by, some, as, the, fading, of, the, arab, israeli, conflict, the, roots, of, the, modern, arab, israeli, conflict, lie, in, the, tensions, between, zionism, and, palestinian, nationalism, the, latter, having, risen, in, response, to, zionism, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, territory, regarded, by, the, jewish, people, as, their, historical, homeland, is, also, considered, by, the, pan, arab, movement, as, historically, and, presently, belonging, to, the, arab, palestinians, palestine, had, been, under, the, control, of, the, ottoman, empire, for, nearly, 400, years, until, its, partitioning, in, the, aftermath, of, the, great, arab, revolt, during, world, war, i, during, the, closing, years, of, their, empire, the, ottomans, began, to, espouse, their, turkish, ethnic, identity, asserting, the, primacy, of, turks, within, the, empire, leading, to, discrimination, against, the, arabs, the, promise, of, liberation, from, the, ottomans, led, many, jews, and, arabs, to, support, the, allied, powers, during, world, war, i, leading, to, the, emergence, of, widespread, arab, nationalism, both, arab, nationalism, and, zionism, had, their, formulative, beginning, in, europe, the, zionist, congress, was, established, in, basel, in, 1897, while, the, arab, club, was, established, in, paris, in, 1906, in, the, late, 19th, century, european, and, middle, eastern, jewish, communities, began, to, increasingly, immigrate, to, palestine, and, purchase, land, from, the, local, ottoman, landlords, the, population, of, the, late, 19th, century, in, palestine, reached, 600, 000, mostly, muslim, arabs, but, also, significant, minorities, of, jews, christians, druze, and, some, samaritans, and, bah, s, at, that, time, jerusalem, did, not, extend, beyond, the, walled, area, and, had, a, population, of, only, a, few, tens, of, thousands, collective, farms, known, as, kibbutzim, were, established, as, was, the, first, entirely, jewish, city, in, modern, times, tel, aviv, during, 1915, 16, as, world, war, i, was, underway, the, british, high, commissioner, in, egypt, sir, henry, mcmahon, secretly, corresponded, with, husayn, ibn, ali, the, patriarch, of, the, hashemite, family, and, ottoman, governor, of, mecca, and, medina, mcmahon, convinced, husayn, to, lead, an, arab, revolt, against, the, ottoman, empire, which, was, aligned, with, germany, against, britain, and, france, in, the, war, mcmahon, promised, that, if, the, arabs, supported, britain, in, the, war, the, british, government, would, support, establishing, an, independent, arab, state, under, hashemite, rule, in, the, arab, provinces, of, the, ottoman, empire, including, palestine, the, arab, revolt, led, by, t, e, lawrence, lawrence, of, arabia, and, husayn, s, son, faysal, was, successful, in, defeating, the, ottomans, and, britain, took, control, over, much, of, this, area, in, 1917, palestine, was, conquered, by, the, british, forces, including, the, jewish, legion, the, british, government, issued, the, balfour, declaration, which, stated, that, the, government, viewed, favorably, the, establishment, in, palestine, of, a, national, home, for, the, jewish, people, but, that, nothing, shall, be, done, which, may, prejudice, the, civil, and, religious, rights, of, existing, non, jewish, communities, in, palestine, the, declaration, was, issued, as, a, result, of, the, belief, of, key, members, of, the, government, including, prime, minister, david, lloyd, george, that, jewish, support, was, essential, to, winning, the, war, however, the, declaration, caused, great, disquiet, in, the, arab, world, after, the, war, the, area, came, under, british, rule, as, the, british, mandate, of, palestine, the, area, mandated, to, the, british, in, 1923, included, what, is, today, israel, the, west, bank, and, gaza, strip, transjordan, eventually, was, carved, into, a, separate, british, protectorate, the, emirate, of, transjordan, which, gained, an, autonomous, status, in, 1928, and, achieved, complete, independence, in, 1946, with, the, approval, by, the, united, nations, of, the, end, of, the, british, mandate, a, major, crisis, among, the, arab, nationalists, took, place, with, the, failed, establishment, of, the, arab, kingdom, of, syria, in, 1920, with, the, disastrous, outcome, of, the, franco, syrian, war, the, self, proclaimed, hashemite, kingdom, with, its, capital, in, damascus, was, defeated, and, the, hashemite, ruler, took, refuge, in, mandatory, iraq, the, crisis, saw, the, first, confrontation, of, nationalist, arab, and, jewish, forces, taking, place, in, the, battle, of, tel, hai, in, march, 1920, but, more, importantly, the, collapse, of, the, pan, arabist, kingdom, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, local, palestinian, version, of, arab, nationalism, with, the, return, of, amin, al, husseini, from, damascus, to, jerusalem, in, late, 1920, at, this, point, in, time, jewish, immigration, to, mandatory, palestine, continued, while, to, some, opinions, a, similar, but, less, documented, immigration, also, took, place, in, the, arab, sector, bringing, workers, from, syria, and, other, neighbouring, areas, palestinian, arabs, saw, this, rapid, influx, of, jewish, immigrants, as, a, threat, to, their, homeland, and, their, identity, as, a, people, moreover, jewish, policies, of, purchasing, land, and, prohibiting, the, employment, of, arabs, in, jewish, owned, industries, and, farms, greatly, angered, the, palestinian, arab, communities, demonstrations, were, held, as, early, as, 1920, protesting, what, the, arabs, felt, were, unfair, preferences, for, the, jewish, immigrants, set, forth, by, the, british, mandate, that, governed, palestine, at, the, time, this, resentment, led, to, outbreaks, of, violence, later, that, year, as, the, al, husseini, incited, riots, broke, out, in, jerusalem, winston, churchill, s, 1922, white, paper, tried, to, reassure, the, arab, population, denying, that, the, creation, of, a, jewish, state, was, the, intention, of, the, balfour, declaration, in, 1929, after, a, demonstration, by, vladimir, jabotinsky, s, political, group, betar, at, the, western, wall, riots, started, in, jerusalem, and, expanded, throughout, mandatory, palestine, arabs, murdered, 67, jews,

1931, 17, percent, of, the, population, of, mandatory, palestine, were, jews, an, increase, of, six, percent, since, 1922, jewish, immigration, peaked, soon, after, the, nazis, came, to, power, in, germany, causing, the, jewish, population, in, british, palestine, to, double, in, the, mid, 1930s, izz, ad, din, al, qassam, arrived, from, syria, and, established, the, black, hand, an, anti, zionist, and, anti, british, militant, organization, he, recruited, and, arranged, military, training, for, peasants, and, by, 1935, he, had, enlisted, between, 200, and, 800, men, the, cells, were, equipped, with, bombs, and, firearms, which, they, used, to, kill, jewish, settlers, in, the, area, as, well, as, engaging, in, a, campaign, of, vandalism, of, jewish, settler, plantations, by, 1936, escalating, tensions, led, to, the, 1936, 1939, arab, revolt, in, palestine, in, response, to, arab, pressure, the, british, mandate, authorities, greatly, reduced, the, number, of, jewish, immigrants, to, palestine, see, white, paper, of, 1939, and, the, ss, exodus, these, restrictions, remained, in, place, until, the, end, of, the, mandate, a, period, which, coincided, with, the, nazi, holocaust, and, the, flight, of, jewish, refugees, from, europe, as, a, consequence, most, jewish, entrants, to, mandatory, palestine, were, considered, illegal, see, aliyah, bet, causing, further, tensions, in, the, region, following, several, failed, attempts, to, solve, the, problem, diplomatically, the, british, asked, the, newly, formed, united, nations, for, help, on, 15, may, 1947, the, general, assembly, appointed, a, committee, the, unscop, composed, of, representatives, from, eleven, states, to, make, the, committee, more, neutral, none, of, the, great, powers, were, represented, after, five, weeks, of, in, country, study, the, committee, reported, to, the, general, assembly, on, 3, september, 1947, the, report, contained, a, majority, and, a, minority, plan, the, majority, proposed, a, plan, of, partition, with, economic, union, the, minority, proposed, the, independent, state, of, palestine, with, only, slight, modifications, the, plan, of, partition, with, economic, union, was, the, one, the, adoption, and, implementation, of, which, was, recommended, in, resolution, 181, ii, of, 29, november, 1947, the, resolution, was, adopted, by, 33, votes, to, 13, with, 10,

control, over, all, the, territory, allocated, by, the, un, to, the, jewish, state, creating, a, large, number, of, refugees, and, capturing, the, towns, of, tiberias, haifa, safad, beisan, and, in, effect, jaffa, early, in, 1948, the, united, kingdom, announced, its, firm, intention, to, terminate, its, mandate, in, palestine, on, 14, may, in, response, us, president, harry, s, truman, made, a, statement, on, 25, march, proposing, un, trusteeship, rather, than, partition, stating, that, unfortunately, it, has, become, clear, that, the, partition, plan, cannot, be, carried, out, at, this, time, by, peaceful, means, unless, emergency, action, is, taken, there, will, be, no, public, authority, in, palestine, on, that, date, capable, of, preserving, law, and, order, violence, and, bloodshed, will, descend, upon, the, holy, land, large, scale, fighting, among, the, people, of, that, country, will, be, the, inevitable, result, on, 14, may, 1948, the, day, on, which, the, british, mandate, over, palestine, expired, the, jewish, people, s, council, gathered, at, the, tel, aviv, museum, and, approved, a, proclamation, that, declared, the, establishment, of, a, jewish, state, in,

law, and, order, in, palestine, clause, 10, e, further, in, clause, 10, e, the, governments, of, the, arab, states, hereby, confirm, at, this, stage, the, view, that, had, been, repeatedly, declared, by, them, on, previous, occasions, such, as, the, london, conference, and, before, the, united, nations, mainly, the, only, fair, and, just, solution, to, the, problem, of, palestine, is, the, creation, of, united, state, of, palestine, based, upon, the, democratic, principles, that, day, the, armies, of, egypt, lebanon, syria, jordan, and, iraq, invaded, what, had, just, ceased, to, be, the, british, mandate, marking, the, beginning, of, the, 1948, arab, israeli, war, the, nascent, israeli, defense, force, repulsed, the, arab, nations, from, part, of, the, occupied, territories, thus, extending, its, borders, beyond, the, original, unscop, partition, by, december, 1948, israel, controlled, most, of, the, portion, of, mandate, palestine, west, of, the, jordan, river, the, remainder, of, the, mandate, consisted, of, jordan, the, area, that, came, to, be, called, the, west, bank, controlled, by, jordan, and, the, gaza, strip, controlled, by, egypt, before, and, during, this, conflict, 713, 000, palestinian, arabs, fled, their, original, lands, to, become, palestinian, refugees, in, part, due, to, a, promise, from, arab, leaders, that, they, would, be, able, to, return, when, the, war, had, been, won, and, also, in, part, due, to, attacks, on, palestinian, villages, and, towns, by, israeli, forces, and, jewish, militant, groups, during, the, war, official, israeli, documents, subsequently, uncovered, by, benny, morris, and, benjamin, kedar, have, revealed, that, israel, conducted, a, biological, warfare, campaign, codenamed, cast, thy, bread, to, covertly, poison, palestinian, wells, to, prevent, villagers, from, returning, many, palestinians, fled, from, the, areas, that, are, now, israel, as, a, response, to, massacres, of, arab, towns, by, militant, jewish, organizations, like, the, irgun, and, the, lehi, group, see, deir, yassin, massacre, the, war, came, to, an, end, with, the, signing, of, the, 1949, armistice, agreements, between,

countries, as, a, result, of, israel, s, victory, in, the, 1948, arab, israeli, war, any, arabs, caught, on, the, wrong, side, of, the, ceasefire, line, were, unable, to, return, to, their, homes, in, what, became, israel, likewise, any, jews, on, the, west, bank, or, in, gaza, were, exiled, from, their, property, and, homes, to, israel, today, s, palestinian, refugees, are, the, descendants, of, those, who, left, the, responsibility, for, their, exodus, being, a, matter, of, dispute, between, the, israeli, and, the, palestinian, side, 114, historian, benny, morris, has, claimed, that, the, decisive, cause, for, the, abandonment, by, palestinian, arabs, of, their, settlements, was, predominantly, related, to, or, caused, by, actions, of, the, jewish, forces, citing, actual, physical, expulsions, military, assaults, on, settlements, fear, of, being, caught, up, in, fighting, the, fall, of, nearby, settlements, and, propaganda, inciting, flight, while, abandonment, due, to, orders, by, the, arab, leadership, was, decisive, in, only, six, out, of, the, 392, depopulated, arab, settlements, analysed, by, him, xiv, xviii, over, 700, 000, jews, emigrated, to, israel, between, 1948,
