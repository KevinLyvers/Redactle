the, history, of, aviation, extends, for, more, than, 2000, years, from, the, earliest, forms, of, aviation, such, as, kites, and, attempts, at, tower, jumping, to, supersonic, and, hypersonic, flight, by, powered, heavier, than, air, jets, kite, flying, in, china, dates, back, to, several, hundred, years, bc, and, slowly, spread, around, the, world, it, is, thought, to, be, the, earliest, example, of, man, made, flight, leonardo, da, vinci, s, 15th, century, dream, of, flight, found, expression, in, several, rational, designs, but, which, relied, on, poor, science, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, montgolfier, brothers, invented, the, hot, air, balloon, and, began, manned, flights, at, almost, the, same, time, the, discovery, of, hydrogen, gas, led, to, the, invention, of, the, hydrogen, balloon, various, theories, in, mechanics, by, physicists, during, the, same, period, such, as, fluid, dynamics, and, newton, s, laws, of, motion, led, to, the, foundation, of, modern, aerodynamics, most, notably, by, sir, george, cayley, balloons, both, free, flying, and, tethered, began, to, be, used, for, military, purposes, from, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, with, the, french, government, establishing, balloon, companies, during, the, french, revolution, experiments, with, gliders, provided, the, groundwork, for, learning, the, dynamics, of, heavier, than, air, craft, most, notably, by, cayley, otto, lilienthal, and, octave, chanute, by, the, early, 20th, century, advances, in, engine, technology, and, aerodynamics, made, controlled, powered, flight, possible, for, the, first, time, in, 1903, following, their, pioneering, research, and, experiments, with, wing, design, and, aircraft, control, the, wright, brothers, successfully, incorporated, all, of, the, required, elements, to, create, and, fly, the, first, aeroplane, the, basic, configuration, with, its, characteristic, tail, was, established, by, 1909, followed, by, rapid, design, and, performance, improvements, aided, by, the, development, of, more, powerful, engines, the, first, great, ships, of, the, air, were, the, rigid, dirigible, balloons, pioneered, by, ferdinand, von, zeppelin, which, soon, became, synonymous, with, airships, and, dominated, long, distance, flight, until, the, 1930s, when, large, flying, boats, became, popular, after, world, war, ii, the, flying, boats, were, in, their, turn, replaced, by, land, planes, and, the, new, and, immensely, powerful, jet, engine, revolutionised, both, air, travel, and, military, aviation, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 20th, century, the, advent, of, digital, electronics, produced, great, advances, in, flight, instrumentation, and, fly, by, wire, systems, the, 21st, century, saw, the, large, scale, use, of, pilotless, drones, for, military, civilian, and, leisure, use, with, digital, controls, inherently, unstable, aircraft, such, as, flying, wings, became, possible, the, term, aviation, noun, of, action, from, stem, of, latin, avis, bird, with, suffix, ation, meaning, action, or, progress, was, coined, in, 1863, by, french, pioneer, guillaume, joseph, gabriel, de, la, landelle, 1812, 1886, in, aviation, ou, navigation, a, rienne, sans, ballons, since, antiquity, there, have, been, stories, of, men, strapping, birdlike, wings, stiffened, cloaks, or, other, devices, to, themselves, and, attempting, to, fly, typically, by, jumping, off, a, tower, the, greek, legend, of, daedalus, and, icarus, is, one, of, the, earliest, known, others, originated, from, ancient, asia, and, the, european, middle, age, during, this, early, period, the, issues, of, lift, stability, and, control, were, not, understood, and, most, attempts, ended, in, serious, injury, or, death, the, andalusian, scientist, abbas, ibn, firnas, 810, 887, ad, is, claimed, to, have, made, a, jump, in, c, rdoba, spain, covering, his, body, with, vulture, feathers, and, attaching, two, wings, to, his, arms, the, 17th, century, algerian, historian, ahmed, mohammed, al, maqqari, quoting, a, poem, by, muhammad, i, of, c, rdoba, s, 9th, century, court, poet, mu, min, ibn, said, recounts, that, firnas, flew, some, distance, before, landing, with, some, injuries, attributed, to, his, lacking, a, tail, as, birds, use, to, land, writing, in, the, 12th, century, william, of, malmesbury, stated, that, the, 11th, century, benedictine, monk, eilmer, of, malmesbury, attached, wings, to, his, hands, and, feet, and, flew, a, short, distance, but, broke, both, legs, while, landing, also, having, neglected, to, make, himself, a, tail, many, others, made, well, documented, jumps, in, the, following, centuries, as, late, as, 1811, albrecht, berblinger, constructed, an, ornithopter, and, jumped, into, the, danube, at, ulm, the, kite, may, have, been, the, first, form, of, man, made, aircraft, it, was, invented, in, china, possibly, as, far, back, as, the, 5th, century, bc, by, mozi, mo, di, and, lu, ban, gongshu, ban, later, designs, often, emulated, flying, insects, birds, and, other, beasts, both, real, and, mythical, some, were, fitted, with, strings, and, whistles, to, make, musical, sounds, while, flying, ancient, and, mediaeval, chinese, sources, describe, kites, being, used, to, measure, distances, test, the, wind, lift, men, signal, and, communicate, and, send, messages, kites, spread, from, china, around, the, world, after, its, introduction, into, india, the, kite, further, evolved, into, the, fighter, kite, which, has, an, abrasive, line, used, to, cut, down, other, kites, man, carrying, kites, are, believed, to, have, been, used, extensively, in, ancient, china, for, both, civil, and, military, purposes, and, sometimes, enforced, as, a, punishment, an, early, recorded, flight, was, that, of, the, prisoner, yuan, huangtou, a, chinese, prince, in, the, 6th, century, ad, stories, of, man, carrying, kites, also, occur, in, japan, following, the, introduction, of, the, kite, from, china, around, the, seventh, century, ad, it, is, said, that, at, one, time, there, was, a, japanese, law, against, man, carrying, kites, the, use, of, a, rotor, for, vertical, flight, has, existed, since, 400, bc, in, the, form, of, the, bamboo, copter, an, ancient, chinese, toy, the, similar, moulinet, noix, rotor, on, a, nut, appeared, in, europe, in, the, 14th, century, ad, from, ancient, times, the, chinese, have, understood, that, hot, air, rises, and, have, applied, the, principle, to, a, type, of, small, hot, air, balloon, called, a, sky, lantern, a, sky, lantern, consists, of, a, paper, balloon, under, or, just, inside, which, a, small, lamp, is, placed, sky, lanterns, are, traditionally, launched, for, pleasure, and, during, festivals, according, to, joseph, needham, such, lanterns, were, known, in, china, from, the, 3rd, century, bc, their, military, use, is, attributed, to, the, general, zhuge, liang, 180, 234, ad, honorific, title, kongming, who, is, said, to, have, used, them, to, scare, the, enemy, troops, there, is, evidence, that, the, chinese, also, solved, the, problem, of, aerial, navigation, using, balloons, hundreds, of, years, before, the, 18th, century, eventually, after, ibn, firnas, s, construction, some, investigators, began, to, discover, and, define, some, of, the, basics, of, rational, aircraft, design, most, notable, of, these, was, leonardo, da, vinci, although, his, work, remained, unknown, until, 1797, and, so, had, no, influence, on, developments, over, the, next, three, hundred, years, while, his, designs, are, rational, they, are, not, scientific, he, particularly, underestimated, the, amount, of, power, that, would, be, needed, to, propel, a, flying, object, basing, his, designs, on, the, flapping, wings, of, a, bird, rather, than, an, engine, powered, propeller, leonardo, studied, bird, and, bat, flight, claiming, the, superiority, of, the, latter, owing, to, its, unperforated, wing, he, analyzed, these, and, anticipating, many, principles, of, aerodynamics, he, understood, that, an, object, offers, as, much, resistance, to, the, air, as, the, air, does, to, the, object, isaac, newton, would, not, publish, his, third, law, of, motion, until, 1687, from, the, last, years, of, the, 15th, century, until, 1505, leonardo, wrote, about, and, sketched, many, designs, for, flying, machines, and, mechanisms, including, ornithopters, fixed, wing, gliders, rotorcraft, perhaps, inspired, by, whirligig, toys, parachutes, in, the, form, of, a, wooden, framed, pyramidal, tent, and, a, wind, speed, gauge, his, early, designs, were, man, powered, and, included, ornithopters, and, rotorcraft, however, he, came, to, realise, the, impracticality, of, this, and, later, turned, to, controlled, gliding, flight, also, sketching, some, designs, powered, by, a, spring, in, an, essay, titled, sul, volo, on, flight, leonardo, describes, a, flying, machine, called, the, bird, which, he, built, from, starched, linen, leather, joints, and, raw, silk, thongs, in, the, codex, atlanticus, he, wrote, tomorrow, morning, on, the, second, day, of, january, 1496, i, will, make, the, thong, and, the, attempt, according, to, one, commonly, repeated, albeit, presumably, fictional, story, in, 1505, leonardo, or, one, of, his, pupils, attempted, to, fly, from, the, summit, of, monte, ceceri, in, 1670, francesco, lana, de, terzi, published, a, work, that, suggested, lighter, than, air, flight, would, be, possible, by, using, copper, foil, spheres, that, containing, a, vacuum, would, be, lighter, than, the, displaced, air, to, lift, an, airship, while, theoretically, sound, his, design, was, not, feasible, the, pressure, of, the, surrounding, air, would, crush, the, spheres, the, idea, of, using, a, vacuum, to, produce, lift, is, now, known, as, vacuum, airship, but, remains, unfeasible, with, any, current, materials, in, 1709, bartolomeu, de, gusm, o, presented, a, petition, to, king, john, v, of, portugal, begging, for, support, for, his, invention, of, an, airship, in, which, he, expressed, the, greatest, confidence, the, public, test, of, the, machine, which, was, set, for, 24, june, 1709, did, not, take, place, according, to, contemporary, reports, however, gusm, o, appears, to, have, made, several, less, ambitious, experiments, with, this, machine, descending, from, eminences, it, is, certain, that, gusm, o, was, working, on, this, principle, at, the, public, exhibition, he, gave, before, the, court, on, 8, august, 1709, in, the, hall, of, the, casa, da, ndia, in, lisbon, when, he, propelled, a, ball, to, the, roof, by, combustion, 1783, was, a, watershed, year, for, ballooning, and, aviation, between, 4, june, and, 1, december, five, aviation, firsts, were, achieved, in, france, ballooning, became, a, major, rage, in, europe, in, the, late, 18th, century, providing, the, first, detailed, understanding, of, the, relationship, between, altitude, and, the, atmosphere, non, steerable, balloons, were, employed, during, the, american, civil, war, by, the, union, army, balloon, corps, the, young, ferdinand, von, zeppelin, first, flew, as, a, balloon, passenger, with, the, union, army, of, the, potomac, in, 1863, in, the, early, 1900s, ballooning, was, a, popular, sport, in, britain, these, privately, owned, balloons, usually, used, coal, gas, as, the, lifting, gas, this, has, half, the, lifting, power, of, hydrogen, so, the, balloons, had, to, be, larger, however, coal, gas, was, far, more, readily, available, and, the, local, gas, works, sometimes, provided, a, special, lightweight, formula, for, ballooning, events, airships, were, originally, called, dirigible, balloons, and, are, still, sometimes, called, dirigibles, today, work, on, developing, a, steerable, or, dirigible, balloon, continued, sporadically, throughout, the, 19th, century, the, first, powered, controlled, sustained, lighter, than, air, flight, is, believed, to, have, taken, place, in, 1852, when, henri, giffard, flew, 15, miles, 24, km, in, france, with, a, steam, engine, driven, craft, another, advance, was, made, in, 1884, when, the, first, fully, controllable, free, flight, was, made, in, a, french, army, electric, powered, airship, la, france, by, charles, renard, and, arthur, krebs, the, 170, foot, 52, m, long, 66, 000, cubic, foot, 1, 900, m, 3, airship, covered, 8, km, 5, 0, mi, in, 23, minutes, with, the, aid, of, an, 8, horsepower, electric, motor, however, these, aircraft, were, generally, short, lived, and, extremely, frail, routine, controlled, flights, would, not, occur, until, the, advent, of, the, internal, combustion, engine, see, below, the, first, aircraft, to, make, routine, controlled, flights, were, non, rigid, airships, sometimes, called, blimps, the, most, successful, early, pioneering, pilot, of, this, type, of, aircraft, was, the, brazilian, alberto, santos, dumont, who, effectively, combined, a, balloon, with, an, internal, combustion, engine, on, 19, october, 1901, he, flew, his, airship, number, 6, over, paris, from, the, parc, de, saint, cloud, around, the, eiffel, tower, and, back, in, under, 30, minutes, to, win, the, deutsch, de, la, meurthe, prize, santos, dumont, went, on, to, design, and, build, several, aircraft, the, subsequent, controversy, surrounding, his, and, others, competing, claims, with, regard, to, aircraft, overshadowed, his, great, contribution, to, the, development, of, airships, at, the, same, time, that, non, rigid, airships, were, starting, to, have, some, success, the, first, successful, rigid, airships, were, also, being, developed, these, would, be, far, more, capable, than, fixed, wing, aircraft, in, terms, of, pure, cargo, carrying, capacity, for, decades, rigid, airship, design, and, advancement, was, pioneered, by, the, german, count, ferdinand, von, zeppelin, construction, of, the, first, zeppelin, airship, began, in, 1899, in, a, floating, assembly, hall, on, lake, constance, in, the, bay, of, manzell, friedrichshafen, this, was, intended, to, ease, the, starting, procedure, as, the, hall, could, easily, be, aligned, with, the, wind, the, prototype, airship, lz, 1, lz, for, luftschiff, zeppelin, had, a, length, of, 128, m, 420, ft, was, driven, by, two, 10, 6, kw, 14, 2, hp, daimler, engines, and, balanced, by, moving, a, weight, between, its, two, nacelles, its, first, flight, on, 2, july, 1900, lasted, for, only, 18, minutes, as, lz, 1, was, forced, to, land, on, the, lake, after, the, winding, mechanism, for, the, balancing, weight, had, broken, upon, repair, the, technology, proved, its, potential, in, subsequent, flights, bettering, the, 6, m, s, speed, attained, by, the, french, airship, la, france, by, 3, m, s, but, could, not, yet, convince, possible, investors, it, would, be, several, years, before, the, count, was, able, to, raise, enough, funds, for, another, try, german, airship, passenger, service, known, as, delag, deutsche, luftschiffahrts, ag, was, established, in, 1910, although, airships, were, used, in, both, world, war, i, and, ii, and, continue, on, a, limited, basis, to, this, day, their, development, has, been, largely, overshadowed, by, heavier, than, air, craft, traveller, evliya, elebi, reported, that, in, 1633, ottoman, scientist, and, engineer, lagari, hasan, elebi, blasted, off, from, sarayburnu, the, promontory, below, the, topkap, palace, in, istanbul, in, a, 7, winged, rocket, propelled, by, 50, okka, 140, lbs, of, gunpowder, the, flight, was, said, to, have, been, undertaken, at, the, time, of, the, birth, of, sultan, murad, iv, s, daughter, as, evliya, celebi, wrote, lagari, proclaimed, before, launching, his, craft, o, my, sultan, be, blessed, i, am, going, to, talk, to, jesus, after, ascending, in, the, rocket, he, landed, in, the, sea, swimming, ashore, and, joking, o, my, sultan, jesus, sends, his, regards, to, you, he, was, rewarded, by, the, sultan, with, silver, and, the, rank, of, sipahi, in, the, ottoman, army, evliya, elebi, also, wrote, of, lagari, s, brother, hez, rfen, ahmed, elebi, making, a, flight, by, glider, a, year, earlier, italian, inventor, tito, livio, burattini, invited, by, the, polish, king, w, adys, aw, iv, to, his, court, in, warsaw, built, a, model, aircraft, with, four, fixed, glider, wings, in, 1647, described, as, four, pairs, of, wings, attached, to, an, elaborate, dragon, it, was, said, to, have, successfully, lifted, a, cat, in, 1648, but, not, burattini, himself, he, promised, that, only, the, most, minor, injuries, would, result, from, landing, the, craft, his, dragon, volant, is, considered, the, most, elaborate, and, sophisticated, aeroplane, to, be, built, before, the, 19th, century, the, first, published, paper, on, aviation, was, sketch, of, a, machine, for, flying, in, the, air, by, emanuel, swedenborg, published, in, 1717, this, flying, machine, consisted, of, a, light, frame, covered, with, strong, canvas, and, provided, with, two, large, oars, or, wings, moving, on, a, horizontal, axis, arranged, so, that, the, upstroke, met, with, no, resistance, while, the, downstroke, provided, lifting, power, swedenborg, knew, that, the, machine, would, not, fly, but, suggested, it, as, a, start, and, was, confident, that, the, problem, would, be, solved, he, wrote, it, seems, easier, to, talk, of, such, a, machine, than, to, put, it, into, actuality, for, it, requires, greater, force, and, less, weight, than, exists, in, a, human, body, the, science, of, mechanics, might, perhaps, suggest, a, means, namely, a, strong, spiral, spring, if, these, advantages, and, requisites, are, observed, perhaps, in, time, to, come, someone, might, know, how, better, to, utilise, our, sketch, and, cause, some, addition, to, be, made, so, as, to, accomplish, that, which, we, can, only, suggest, yet, there, are, sufficient, proofs, and, examples, from, nature, that, such, flights, can, take, place, without, danger, although, when, the, first, trials, are, made, you, may, have, to, pay, for, the, experience, and, not, mind, an, arm, or, leg, swedenborg, would, prove, prescient, in, his, observation, that, a, method, of, powering, of, an, aircraft, was, one, of, the, critical, problems, to, be, overcome, on, 16, may, 1793, the, spanish, inventor, diego, mar, n, aguilera, managed, to, cross, the, river, arandilla, in, coru, a, del, conde, castile, flying, 300, 400, m, with, a, flying, machine, balloon, jumping, replaced, tower, jumping, also, demonstrating, with, typically, fatal, results, that, man, power, and, flapping, wings, were, useless, in, achieving, flight, at, the, same, time, scientific, study, of, heavier, than, air, flight, began, in, earnest, in, 1801, the, french, officer, andr, guillaume, resnier, de, gou, managed, a, 300, metre, glide, by, starting, from, the, top, of, the, city, walls, of, angoul, me, and, broke, only, one, leg, on, arrival, in, 1837, french, mathematician, and, brigadier, general, isidore, didion, stated, aviation, will, be, successful, only, if, one, finds, an, engine, whose, ratio, with, the, weight, of, the, device, to, be, supported, will, be, larger, than, current, steam, machines, or, the, strength, developed, by, humans, or, most, of, the, animals, sir, george, cayley, was, first, called, the, father, of, the, aeroplane, in, 1846, during, the, last, years, of, the, previous, century, he, had, begun, the, first, rigorous, study, of, the, physics, of, flight, and, would, later, design, the, first, modern, heavier, than, air, craft, among, his, many, achievements, his, most, important, contributions, to, aeronautics, include, cayley, s, first, innovation, was, to, study, the, basic, science, of, lift, by, adopting, the, whirling, arm, test, rig, for, use, in, aircraft, research, and, using, simple, aerodynamic, models, on, the, arm, rather, than, attempting, to, fly, a, model, of, a, complete, design, in, 1799, he, set, down, the, concept, of, the, modern, aeroplane, as, a, fixed, wing, flying, machine, with, separate, systems, for, lift, propulsion, and, control, in, 1804, cayley, constructed, a, model, glider, which, was, the, first, modern, heavier, than, air, flying, machine, having, the, layout, of, a, conventional, modern, aircraft, with, an, inclined, wing, towards, the, front, and, adjustable, tail, at, the, back, with, both, tailplane, and, fin, a, movable, weight, allowed, adjustment, of, the, model, s, centre, of, gravity, in, 1809, goaded, by, the, farcical, antics, of, his, contemporaries, see, above, he, began, the, publication, of, a, landmark, three, part, treatise, titled, on, aerial, navigation, 1809, 1810, in, it, he, wrote, the, first, scientific, statement, of, the, problem, the, whole, problem, is, confined, within, these, limits, viz, to, make, a, surface, support, a, given, weight, by, the, application, of, power, to, the, resistance, of, air, he, identified, the, four, vector, forces, that, influence, an, aircraft, thrust, lift, drag, and, weight, and, distinguished, stability, and, control, in, his, designs, he, also, identified, and, described, the, importance, of, the, cambered, aerofoil, dihedral, diagonal, bracing, and, drag, reduction, and, contributed, to, the, understanding, and, design, of, ornithopters, and, parachutes, in, 1848, he, had, progressed, far, enough, to, construct, a, glider, in, the, form, of, a, triplane, large, and, safe, enough, to, carry, a, child, a, local, boy, was, chosen, but, his, name, is, not, known, he, went, on, to, publish, in, 1852, the, design, for, a, full, size, manned, glider, or, governable, parachute, to, be, launched, from, a, balloon, and, then, to, construct, a, version, capable, of, launching, from, the, top, of, a, hill, which, carried, the, first, adult, aviator, across, brompton, dale, in, 1853, minor, inventions, included, the, rubber, powered, motor, which, provided, a, reliable, power, source, for, research, models, by, 1808, he, had, even, re, invented, the, wheel, devising, the, tension, spoked, wheel, in, which, all, compression, loads, are, carried, by, the, rim, allowing, a, lightweight, undercarriage, drawing, directly, from, cayley, s, work, henson, s, 1842, design, for, an, aerial, steam, carriage, broke, new, ground, although, only, a, design, it, was, the, first, in, history, for, a, propeller, driven, fixed, wing, aircraft, 1866, saw, the, founding, of, the, aeronautical, society, of, great, britain, and, two, years, later, the, world, s, first, aeronautical, exhibition, was, held, at, the, crystal, palace, london, where, john, stringfellow, was, awarded, a, 100, prize, for, the, steam, engine, with, the, best, power, to, weight, ratio, in, 1848, stringfellow, achieved, the, first, powered, flight, using, an, unmanned, 10, feet, 3, 0, m, wingspan, steam, powered, monoplane, built, in, a, disused, lace, factory, in, chard, somerset, employing, two, contra, rotating, propellers, on, the, first, attempt, made, indoors, the, machine, flew, ten, feet, before, becoming, destabilised, damaging, the, craft, the, second, attempt, was, more, successful, the, machine, leaving, a, guidewire, to, fly, freely, achieving, thirty, yards, of, straight, and, level, powered, flight, francis, herbert, wenham, presented, the, first, paper, to, the, newly, formed, aeronautical, society, later, the, royal, aeronautical, society, on, aerial, locomotion, he, advanced, cayley, s, work, on, cambered, wings, making, important, findings, to, test, his, ideas, from, 1858, he, had, constructed, several, gliders, both, manned, and, unmanned, and, with, up, to, five, stacked, wings, he, realised, that, long, thin, wings, are, better, than, bat, like, ones, because, they, have, more, leading, edge, for, their, area, today, this, relationship, is, known, as, the, aspect, ratio, of, a, wing, the, latter, part, of, the, 19th, century, became, a, period, of, intense, study, characterized, by, the, gentleman, scientists, who, represented, most, research, efforts, until, the, 20th, century, among, them, was, the, british, scientist, philosopher, and, inventor, matthew, piers, watt, boulton, who, studied, lateral, flight, control, and, was, the, first, to, patent, an, aileron, control, system, in, 1868, in, 1871, wenham, made, the, first, wind, tunnel, using, a, fan, driven, by, a, steam, engine, to, propel, air, down, a, 12, ft, 3, 7, m, tube, to, the, model, meanwhile, the, british, advances, had, galvanised, french, researchers, in, 1857, f, lix, du, temple, proposed, a, monoplane, with, a, tailplane, and, retractable, undercarriage, developing, his, ideas, with, a, model, powered, first, by, clockwork, and, later, by, steam, he, eventually, achieved, a, short, hop, with, a, full, size, manned, craft, in, 1874, it, achieved, lift, off, under, its, own, power, after, launching, from, a, ramp, glided, for, a, short, time, and, returned, safely, to, the, ground, making, it, the, first, successful, powered, glide, in, history, in, 1865, louis, pierre, mouillard, published, an, influential, book, the, empire, of, the, air, l, empire, de, l, air, in, 1856, frenchman, jean, marie, le, bris, made, the, first, flight, higher, than, his, point, of, departure, by, having, his, glider, l, albatros, artificiel, pulled, by, a, horse, on, a, beach, he, reportedly, achieved, a, height, of, 100, metres, over, a, distance, of, 200, metres, alphonse, p, naud, a, frenchman, advanced, the, theory, of, wing, contours, and, aerodynamics, and, constructed, successful, models, of, aeroplanes, helicopters, and, ornithopters, in, 1871, he, flew, the, first, aerodynamically, stable, fixed, wing, aeroplane, a, model, monoplane, he, called, the, planophore, a, distance, of, 40, m, 130, ft, p, naud, s, model, incorporated, several, of, cayley, s, discoveries, including, the, use, of, a, tail, wing, dihedral, for, inherent, stability, and, rubber, power, the, planophore, also, had, longitudinal, stability, being, trimmed, such, that, the, tailplane, was, set, at, a, smaller, angle, of, incidence, than, the, wings, an, original, and, important, contribution, to, the, theory, of, aeronautics, p, naud, s, later, project, for, an, amphibian, aeroplane, although, never, built, incorporated, other, modern, features, a, tailless, monoplane, with, a, single, vertical, fin, and, twin, tractor, propellers, it, also, featured, hinged, rear, elevator, and, rudder, surfaces, retractable, undercarriage, and, a, fully, enclosed, instrumented, cockpit, equally, authoritative, as, a, theorist, was, p, naud, s, fellow, countryman, victor, tatin, in, 1879, he, flew, a, model, which, like, p, naud, s, project, was, a, monoplane, with, twin, tractor, propellers, but, also, had, a, separate, horizontal, tail, it, was, powered, by, compressed, air, flown, tethered, to, a, pole, this, was, the, first, model, to, take, off, under, its, own, power, in, 1884, alexandre, goupil, published, his, work, la, locomotion, a, rienne, aerial, locomotion, although, the, flying, machine, he, later, constructed, failed, to, fly, in, 1890, the, french, engineer, cl, ment, ader, completed, the, first, of, three, steam, driven, flying, machines, the, ole, on, 9, october, 1890, ader, made, an, uncontrolled, hop, of, around, 50, metres, 160, ft, this, was, the, first, manned, aeroplane, to, take, off, under, its, own, power, his, avion, iii, of, 1897, notable, only, for, having, twin, steam, engines, failed, to, fly, ader, would, later, claim, success, and, was, not, debunked, until, 1910, when, the, french, army, published, its, report, on, his, attempt, sir, hiram, maxim, was, an, american, engineer, who, had, moved, to, england, he, built, his, own, whirling, arm, rig, and, wind, tunnel, and, constructed, a, large, machine, with, a, wingspan, of, 105, feet, 32, m, a, length, of, 145, feet, 44, m, fore, and, aft, horizontal, surfaces, and, a, crew, of, three, twin, propellers, were, powered, by, two, lightweight, compound, steam, engines, each, delivering, 180, hp, 130, kw, the, overall, weight, was, 8, 000, pounds, 3, 600, kg, it, was, intended, as, a, test, rig, to, investigate, aerodynamic, lift, lacking, flight, controls, it, ran, on, rails, with, a, second, set, of, rails, above, the, wheels, to, restrain, it, completed, in, 1894, on, its, third, run, it, broke, from, the, rail, became, airborne, for, about, 200, yards, at, two, to, three, feet, of, altitude, and, was, badly, damaged, upon, falling, back, to, the, ground, it, was, subsequently, repaired, but, maxim, abandoned, his, experiments, shortly, afterwards, around, the, last, decade, of, the, 19th, century, a, number, of, key, figures, were, refining, and, defining, the, modern, aeroplane, lacking, a, suitable, engine, aircraft, work, focused, on, stability, and, control, in, gliding, flight, in, 1879, biot, constructed, a, bird, like, glider, with, the, help, of, massia, and, flew, in, it, briefly, it, is, preserved, in, the, musee, de, l, air, france, and, is, claimed, to, be, the, earliest, man, carrying, flying, machine, still, in, existence, the, englishman, horatio, phillips, made, key, contributions, to, aerodynamics, he, conducted, extensive, wind, tunnel, research, on, aerofoil, sections, proving, the, principles, of, aerodynamic, lift, foreseen, by, cayley, and, wenham, his, findings, underpin, all, modern, aerofoil, design, between, 1883, and, 1886, the, american, john, joseph, montgomery, developed, a, series, of, three, manned, gliders, before, conducting, his, own, independent, investigations, into, aerodynamics, and, circulation, of, lift, otto, lilienthal, became, known, as, the, glider, king, or, flying, man, of, germany, he, duplicated, wenham, s, work, and, greatly, expanded, on, it, in, 1884, publishing, his, research, in, 1889, as, birdflight, as, the, basis, of, aviation, der, vogelflug, als, grundlage, der, fliegekunst, which, is, seen, as, one, of, the, most, important, works, in, aviation, history, he, also, produced, a, series, of, hang, gliders, including, bat, wing, monoplane, and, biplane, forms, such, as, the, derwitzer, glider, and, normal, soaring, apparatus, which, is, considered, to, be, the, first, air, plane, in, series, production, making, the, maschinenfabrik, otto, lilienthal, the, first, air, plane, production, company, in, the, world, starting, in, 1891, he, became, the, first, person, to, make, controlled, untethered, glides, routinely, and, the, first, to, be, photographed, flying, a, heavier, than, air, machine, stimulating, interest, around, the, world, lilienthal, s, work, led, to, him, developing, the, concept, of, the, modern, wing, his, flights, in, the, year, 1891, are, seen, as, the, beginning, of, human, flight, and, because, of, that, he, is, often, referred, to, as, either, the, father, of, aviation, or, father, of, flight, he, rigorously, documented, his, work, including, photographs, and, for, this, reason, is, one, of, the, best, known, of, the, early, pioneers, lilienthal, made, over, 2, 000, glides, until, his, death, in, 1896, from, injuries, sustained, in, a, glider, crash, picking, up, where, lilienthal, left, off, octave, chanute, took, up, aircraft, design, after, an, early, retirement, and, funded, the, development, of, several, gliders, in, the, summer, of, 1896, his, team, flew, several, of, their, designs, eventually, deciding, that, the, best, was, a, biplane, design, like, lilienthal, he, documented, and, photographed, his, work, in, britain, percy, pilcher, who, had, worked, for, maxim, built, and, successfully, flew, several, gliders, during, the, mid, to, late, 1890s, the, invention, of, the, box, kite, during, this, period, by, the, australian, lawrence, hargrave, would, lead, to, the, development, of, the, practical, biplane, in, 1894, hargrave, linked, four, of, his, kites, together, added, a, sling, seat, and, was, the, first, to, obtain, lift, with, a, heavier, than, air, aircraft, when, he, flew, up, 16, feet, 4, 9, m, later, pioneers, of, manned, kite, flying, included, samuel, franklin, cody, in, england, and, captain, g, nie, saconney, in, france, william, frost, from, pembrokeshire, wales, started, his, project, in, 1880, and, after, 16, years, he, designed, a, flying, machine, and, in, 1894, won, a, patent, for, a, frost, aircraft, glider, reports, say, witnesses, claimed, the, craft, flew, at, saundersfoot, in, 1896, travelling, 500, yards, before, colliding, with, a, tree, and, falling, in, a, field, after, a, distinguished, career, in, astronomy, and, shortly, before, becoming, secretary, of, the, smithsonian, institution, samuel, pierpont, langley, started, a, serious, investigation, into, aerodynamics, at, what, is, today, the, university, of, pittsburgh, in, 1891, he, published, experiments, in, aerodynamics, detailing, his, research, and, then, turned, to, building, his, designs, he, hoped, to, achieve, automatic, aerodynamic, stability, so, he, gave, little, consideration, to, in, flight, control, on, 6, may, 1896, langley, s, aerodrome, no, 5, made, the, first, successful, sustained, flight, of, an, unpiloted, engine, driven, heavier, than, air, craft, of, substantial, size, it, was, launched, from, a, spring, actuated, catapult, mounted, on, top, of, a, houseboat, on, the, potomac, river, near, quantico, virginia, two, flights, were, made, that, afternoon, one, of, 1, 005, metres, 3, 297, ft, and, a, second, of, 700, metres, 2, 300, ft, at, a, speed, of, approximately, 25, miles, per, hour, 40, km, h, on, both, occasions, the, aerodrome, no, 5, landed, in, the, water, as, planned, because, in, order, to, save, weight, it, was, not, equipped, with, landing, gear, on, 28, november, 1896, another, successful, flight, was, made, with, the, aerodrome, no, 6, this, flight, of, 1, 460, metres, 4, 790, ft, was, witnessed, and, photographed, by, alexander, graham, bell, the, aerodrome, no, 6, was, actually, aerodrome, no, 4, greatly, modified, so, little, remained, of, the, original, aircraft, that, it, was, given, a, new, designation, with, the, successes, of, the, aerodrome, no, 5, and, no, 6, langley, started, looking, for, funding, to, build, a, full, scale, man, carrying, version, of, his, designs, spurred, by, the, spanish, american, war, the, u, s, government, granted, him, 50, 000, to, develop, a, man, carrying, flying, machine, for, aerial, reconnaissance, langley, planned, on, building, a, scaled, up, version, known, as, the, aerodrome, a, and, started, with, the, smaller, quarter, scale, aerodrome, which, flew, twice, on, 18, june, 1901, and, then, again, with, a, newer, and, more, powerful, engine, in, 1903, with, the, basic, design, apparently, successfully, tested, he, then, turned, to, the, problem, of, a, suitable, engine, he, contracted, stephen, balzer, to, build, one, but, was, disappointed, when, it, delivered, only, 8, hp, 6, 0, kw, instead, of, the, 12, hp, 8, 9, kw, he, expected, langley, s, assistant, charles, m, manly, then, reworked, the, design, into, a, five, cylinder, water, cooled, radial, that, delivered, 52, hp, 39, kw, at, 950, rpm, a, feat, that, took, years, to, duplicate, now, with, both, power, and, a, design, langley, put, the, two, together, with, great, hopes, to, his, dismay, the, resulting, aircraft, proved, to, be, too, fragile, simply, scaling, up, the, original, small, models, resulted, in, a, design, that, was, too, weak, to, hold, itself, together, two, launches, in, late, 1903, both, ended, with, the, aerodrome, immediately, crashing, into, the, water, the, pilot, manly, was, rescued, each, time, also, the, aircraft, s, control, system, was, inadequate, to, allow, quick, pilot, responses, and, it, had, no, method, of, lateral, control, and, the, aerodrome, s, aerial, stability, was, marginal, langley, s, attempts, to, gain, further, funding, failed, and, his, efforts, ended, nine, days, after, his, second, abortive, launch, on, 8, december, the, wright, brothers, successfully, flew, their, flyer, glenn, curtiss, made, 93, modifications, to, the, aerodrome, and, flew, this, very, different, aircraft, in, 1914, without, acknowledging, the, modifications, the, smithsonian, institution, asserted, that, langley, s, aerodrome, was, the, first, machine, capable, of, flight, gustave, wei, kopf, was, a, german, who, emigrated, to, the, u, s, where, he, soon, changed, his, name, to, whitehead, from, 1897, to, 1915, he, designed, and, built, early, flying, machines, and, engines, on, 14, august, 1901, two, and, a, half, years, before, the, wright, brothers, flight, he, claimed, to, have, carried, out, a, controlled, powered, flight, in, his, number, 21, monoplane, at, fairfield, connecticut, the, flight, was, reported, in, the, bridgeport, sunday, herald, local, newspaper, about, 30, years, later, several, people, questioned, by, a, researcher, claimed, to, have, seen, that, or, other, whitehead, flights, in, march, 2013, jane, s, all, the, world, s, aircraft, an, authoritative, source, for, contemporary, aviation, published, an, editorial, which, accepted, whitehead, s, flight, as, the, first, manned, powered, controlled, flight, of, a, heavier, than, air, craft, the, smithsonian, institution, custodians, of, the, original, wright, flyer, and, many, aviation, historians, continue, to, maintain, that, whitehead, did, not, fly, as, suggested, the, historians, of, the, royal, aeronautical, society, noted, that, all, available, evidence, fails, to, support, the, claim, that, gustave, whitehead, made, sustained, powered, controlled, flights, predating, those, of, the, wright, brothers, the, editors, of, scientific, american, agree, the, data, show, that, not, only, was, whitehead, not, first, in, flight, but, that, he, may, never, have, made, a, controlled, powered, flight, at, any, time, richard, pearse, was, a, new, zealand, farmer, and, inventor, who, performed, pioneering, aviation, experiments, witnesses, interviewed, many, years, afterward, claimed, that, pearse, flew, and, landed, a, powered, heavier, than, air, machine, on, 31, march, 1903, nine, months, before, the, wright, brothers, flew, 21, 30, documentary, evidence, for, these, claims, remains, open, to, interpretation, and, dispute, and, pearse, himself, never, made, such, claims, in, a, newspaper, interview, in, 1909, he, said, he, did, not, attempt, anything, practical, until, 1904, if, he, did, fly, in, 1903, the, flight, appears, to, have, been, poorly, controlled, in, comparison, to, the, wrights, using, a, methodical, approach, and, concentrating, on, the, controllability, of, the, aircraft, the, brothers, built, and, tested, a, series, of, kite, and, glider, designs, from, 1898, to, 1902, before, attempting, to, build, a, powered, design, the, gliders, worked, but, not, as, well, as, the, wrights, had, expected, based, on, the, experiments, and, writings, of, their, predecessors, their, first, full, size, glider, launched, in, 1900, had, only, about, half, the, lift, they, anticipated, their, second, glider, built, the, following, year, performed, even, more, poorly, rather, than, giving, up, the, wrights, constructed, their, own, wind, tunnel, and, created, a, number, of, sophisticated, devices, to, measure, lift, and, drag, on, the, 200, wing, designs, they, tested, as, a, result, the, wrights, corrected, earlier, mistakes, in, calculations, regarding, drag, and, lift, their, testing, and, calculating, produced, a, third, glider, with, a, higher, aspect, ratio, and, true, three, axis, control, they, flew, it, successfully, hundreds, of, times, in, 1902, and, it, performed, far, better, than, the, previous, models, by, using, a, rigorous, system, of, experimentation, involving, wind, tunnel, testing, of, airfoils, and, flight, testing, of, full, size, prototypes, the, wrights, not, only, built, a, working, aircraft, the, following, year, the, wright, flyer, but, also, helped, advance, the, science, of, aeronautical, engineering, the, wrights, appear, to, be, the, first, to, make, serious, studied, attempts, to, simultaneously, solve, the, power, and, control, problems, both, problems, proved, difficult, but, they, never, lost, interest, they, solved, the, control, problem, by, inventing, wing, warping, for, roll, control, combined, with, simultaneous, yaw, control, with, a, steerable, rear, rudder, almost, as, an, afterthought, they, designed, and, built, a, low, powered, internal, combustion, engine, they, also, designed, and, carved, wooden, propellers, that, were, more, efficient, than, any, before, enabling, them, to, gain, adequate, performance, from, their, low, engine, power, although, wing, warping, as, a, means, of, lateral, control, was, used, only, briefly, during, the, early, history, of, aviation, the, principle, of, combining, lateral, control, in, combination, with, a, rudder, was, a, key, advance, in, aircraft, control, while, many, aviation, pioneers, appeared, to, leave, safety, largely, to, chance, the, wrights, design, was, greatly, influenced, by, the, need, to, teach, themselves, to, fly, without, unreasonable, risk, to, life, and, limb, by, surviving, crashes, this, emphasis, as, well, as, low, engine, power, was, the, reason, for, low, flying, speed, and, for, taking, off, in, a, headwind, performance, rather, than, safety, was, the, reason, for, the, rear, heavy, design, because, the, canard, could, not, be, highly, loaded, anhedral, wings, were, less, affected, by, crosswinds, and, were, consistent, with, the, low, yaw, stability, according, to, the, smithsonian, institution, and, f, d, ration, a, ronautique, internationale, fai, the, wrights, made, the, first, sustained, controlled, powered, heavier, than, air, manned, flight, at, kill, devil, hills, north, carolina, four, miles, 8, km, south, of, kitty, hawk, north, carolina, on, 17, december, 1903, the, first, flight, by, orville, wright, of, 120, feet, 37, m, in, 12, seconds, was, recorded, in, a, famous, photograph, in, the, fourth, flight, of, the, same, day, wilbur, wright, flew, 852, feet, 260, m, in, 59, seconds, the, flights, were, witnessed, by, three, coastal, lifesaving, crewmen, a, local, businessman, and, a, boy, from, the, village, making, these, the, first, public, flights, and, the, first, well, documented, ones, orville, described, the, final, flight, of, the, day, the, first, few, hundred, feet, were, up, and, down, as, before, but, by, the, time, three, hundred, feet, had, been, covered, the, machine, was, under, much, better, control, the, course, for, the, next, four, or, five, hundred, feet, had, but, little, undulation, however, when, out, about, eight, hundred, feet, the, machine, began, pitching, again, and, in, one, of, its, darts, downward, struck, the, ground, the, distance, over, the, ground, was, measured, to, be, 852, feet, 260, m, the, time, of, the, flight, was, 59, seconds, the, frame, supporting, the, front, rudder, was, badly, broken, but, the, main, part, of, the, machine, was, not, injured, at, all, we, estimated, that, the, machine, could, be, put, in, condition, for, flight, again, in, about, a, day, or, two, they, flew, only, about, ten, feet, above, the, ground, as, a, safety, precaution, so, they, had, little, room, to, manoeuvre, and, all, four, flights, in, the, gusty, winds, ended, in, a, bumpy, and, unintended, landing, modern, analysis, by, professor, fred, e, c, culick, and, henry, r, rex, 1985, has, demonstrated, that, the, 1903, wright, flyer, was, so, unstable, as, to, be, almost, unmanageable, by, anyone, but, the, wrights, who, had, trained, themselves, in, the, 1902, glider, the, wrights, continued, flying, at, huffman, prairie, near, dayton, ohio, in, 1904, 05, in, may, 1904, they, introduced, the, flyer, ii, a, heavier, and, improved, version, of, the, original, flyer, on, 23, june, 1905, they, first, flew, a, third, machine, the, flyer, iii, after, a, severe, crash, on, 14, july, 1905, they, rebuilt, the, flyer, iii, and, made, important, design, changes, they, almost, doubled, the, size, of, the, elevator, and, rudder, and, moved, them, about, twice, the, distance, from, the, wings, they, added, two, fixed, vertical, vanes, called, blinkers, between, the, elevators, and, gave, the, wings, a, very, slight, dihedral, they, disconnected, the, rudder, from, the, wing, warping, control, and, as, in, all, future, aircraft, placed, it, on, a, separate, control, handle, when, flights, resumed, the, results, were, immediate, the, serious, pitch, instability, that, hampered, flyers, i, and, ii, was, significantly, reduced, so, repeated, minor, crashes, were, eliminated, flights, with, the, redesigned, flyer, iii, started, lasting, over, 10, minutes, then, 20, then, 30, flyer, iii, became, the, first, practical, aircraft, though, without, wheels, and, needing, a, launching, device, flying, consistently, under, full, control, and, bringing, its, pilot, back, to, the, starting, point, safely, and, landing, without, damage, on, 5, october, 1905, wilbur, flew, 24, miles, 39, km, in, 39, minutes, 23, seconds, according, to, the, april, 1907, issue, of, the, scientific, american, magazine, the, wright, brothers, seemed, to, have, the, most, advanced, knowledge, of, heavier, than, air, navigation, at, the, time, however, the, same, magazine, issue, also, claimed, that, no, public, flight, had, been, made, in, the, united, states, before, its, april, 1907, issue, hence, they, devised, the, scientific, american, aeronautic, trophy, in, order, to, encourage, the, development, of, a, heavier, than, air, flying, machine, glenn, h, curtiss, won, the, trophy, in, 1908, with, the, first, pre, announced, and, officially, recorded, flight, of, the, june, bug, this, period, saw, the, development, of, practical, aeroplanes, and, airships, and, their, early, application, alongside, balloons, and, kites, for, private, sport, and, military, use, although, full, details, of, the, wright, brothers, system, of, flight, control, had, been, published, in, l, aerophile, in, january, 1906, the, importance, of, this, advance, was, not, recognised, and, european, experimenters, generally, concentrated, on, attempting, to, produce, inherently, stable, machines, short, powered, flights, were, performed, in, france, by, romanian, engineer, traian, vuia, on, 18, march, and, 19, august, 1906, when, he, flew, 12, and, 24, metres, respectively, in, a, self, designed, fully, self, propelled, fixed, wing, aircraft, that, possessed, a, fully, wheeled, undercarriage, he, was, followed, by, jacob, ellehammer, who, built, a, monoplane, which, he, tested, with, a, tether, in, denmark, on, 12, september, 1906, flying, 42, metres, on, 13, september, 1906, the, brazilian, alberto, santos, dumont, made, a, public, flight, in, paris, with, the, 14, bis, also, known, as, oiseau, de, proie, french, for, bird, of, prey, this, was, of, canard, configuration, with, pronounced, wing, dihedral, and, covered, a, distance, of, 60, m, 200, ft, on, the, grounds, of, the, chateau, de, bagatelle, in, paris, bois, de, boulogne, before, a, large, crowd, of, witnesses, this, well, documented, event, was, the, first, flight, verified, by, the, a, ro, club, de, france, of, a, powered, heavier, than, air, machine, in, europe, and, won, the, deutsch, archdeacon, prize, for, the, first, officially, observed, flight, greater, than, 25, m, 82, ft, on, 12, november, 1906, santos, dumont, set, the, first, world, record, recognized, by, the, federation, aeronautique, internationale, by, flying, 220, m, 720, ft, in, 21, 5, seconds, only, one, more, brief, flight, was, made, by, the, 14, bis, in, march, 1907, after, which, it, was, abandoned, in, march, 1907, gabriel, voisin, flew, the, first, example, of, his, voisin, biplane, on, 13, january, 1908, a, second, example, of, the, type, was, flown, by, henri, farman, to, win, the, deutsch, archdeacon, grand, prix, d, aviation, prize, for, a, flight, in, which, the, aircraft, flew, a, distance, of, more, than, a, kilometre, and, landed, at, the, point, where, it, had, taken, off, the, flight, lasted, 1, minute, and, 28, seconds, santos, dumont, later, added, ailerons, between, the, wings, in, an, effort, to, gain, more, lateral, stability, his, final, design, first, flown, in, 1907, was, the, series, of, demoiselle, monoplanes, nos, 19, to, 22, the, demoiselle, no, 19, could, be, constructed, in, only, 15, days, and, became, the, world, s, first, series, production, aircraft, the, demoiselle, achieved, 120, km, h, the, fuselage, consisted, of, three, specially, reinforced, bamboo, booms, the, pilot, sat, in, a, seat, between, the, main, wheels, of, a, conventional, landing, gear, whose, pair, of, wire, spoked, mainwheels, were, located, at, the, lower, front, of, the, airframe, with, a, tailskid, half, way, back, beneath, the, rear, fuselage, structure, the, demoiselle, was, controlled, in, flight, by, a, cruciform, tail, unit, hinged, on, a, form, of, universal, joint, at, the, aft, end, of, the, fuselage, structure, to, function, as, elevator, and, rudder, with, roll, control, provided, through, wing, warping, no, 20, with, the, wings, only, warping, down, in, 1908, wilbur, wright, travelled, to, europe, and, starting, in, august, gave, a, series, of, flight, demonstrations, at, le, mans, in, france, the, first, demonstration, made, on, 8, august, attracted, an, audience, including, most, of, the, major, french, aviation, experimenters, who, were, astonished, by, the, clear, superiority, of, the, wright, brothers, aircraft, particularly, its, ability, to, make, tight, controlled, turns, the, importance, of, using, roll, control, in, making, turns, was, recognised, by, almost, all, the, european, experimenters, henri, farman, fitted, ailerons, to, his, voisin, biplane, and, shortly, afterwards, set, up, his, own, aircraft, construction, business, whose, first, product, was, the, influential, farman, iii, biplane, the, following, year, saw, the, widespread, recognition, of, powered, flight, as, something, other, than, the, preserve, of, dreamers, and, eccentrics, on, 25, july, 1909, louis, bl, riot, won, worldwide, fame, by, winning, a, 1, 000, prize, offered, by, the, british, daily, mail, newspaper, for, a, flight, across, the, english, channel, and, in, august, around, half, a, million, people, including, the, president, of, france, armand, falli, res, and, david, lloyd, george, attended, one, of, the, first, aviation, meetings, the, grande, semaine, d, aviation, at, reims, in, 1914, pioneering, aviator, tony, jannus, captained, the, inaugural, flight, of, the, st, petersburg, tampa, airboat, line, the, world, s, first, commercial, passenger, airline, historians, disagree, about, whether, the, wright, brothers, patent, war, impeded, development, of, the, aviation, industry, in, the, united, states, compared, to, europe, the, patent, war, ended, during, world, war, i, when, the, government, pressured, the, industry, into, forming, a, patent, pool, and, major, litigants, had, left, the, industry, in, 1877, the, italian, engineer, inventor, and, aeronautical, pioneer, enrico, forlanini, developed, an, unmanned, helicopter, powered, by, a, steam, engine, it, rose, to, a, height, of, 13, metres, 43, feet, where, it, remained, for, 20, seconds, after, a, vertical, take, off, from, a, park, in, milan, milan, has, dedicated, to, enrico, forlanini, its, city, airport, also, named, linate, airport, as, well, as, the, nearby, park, the, parco, forlanini, in, milan, he, also, has, an, avenue, named, after, him, viale, enrico, forlanini, the, first, time, a, manned, helicopter, is, known, to, have, risen, off, the, ground, was, on, a, tethered, flight, in, 1907, by, the, breguet, richet, gyroplane, later, the, same, year, the, cornu, helicopter, also, french, made, the, first, rotary, winged, free, flight, at, lisieux, france, however, these, were, not, practical, designs, almost, as, soon, as, they, were, invented, aeroplanes, were, used, for, military, purposes, the, first, country, to, use, them, for, military, purposes, was, italy, whose, aircraft, made, reconnaissance, bombing, and, artillery, correction, flights, in, libya, during, the, italian, turkish, war, september, 1911, october, 1912, in, addition, the, first, warplane, shot, down, in, history, was, shot, down, by, ottoman, soldiers, rifle, fire, during, this, war, the, first, mission, a, reconnaissance, occurred, on, 23, october, 1911, the, first, bombing, mission, was, flown, on, 1, november, 1911, then, bulgaria, followed, this, example, its, aeroplanes, attacked, and, reconnoitred, the, ottoman, positions, during, the, first, balkan, war, 1912, 13, the, first, war, to, see, major, use, of, aeroplanes, in, offensive, defensive, and, reconnaissance, capabilities, was, world, war, i, the, allies, and, central, powers, both, used, aeroplanes, and, airships, extensively, while, the, concept, of, using, the, aeroplane, as, an, offensive, weapon, was, generally, discounted, before, world, war, i, the, idea, of, using, it, for, photography, was, one, that, was, not, lost, on, any, of, the, major, forces, all, of, the, major, forces, in, europe, had, light, aircraft, typically, derived, from, pre, war, sporting, designs, attached, to, their, reconnaissance, departments, radiotelephones, were, also, being, explored, on, aeroplanes, notably, the, scr, 68, as, communication, between, pilots, and, ground, commander, grew, more, and, more, important, it, was, not, long, before, aircraft, were, shooting, at, each, other, but, the, lack, of, any, sort, of, steady, point, for, the, gun, was, a, problem, the, french, solved, this, problem, when, in, late, 1914, roland, garros, attached, a, fixed, machine, gun, to, the, front, of, his, plane, but, while, adolphe, pegoud, would, become, known, as, the, first, ace, getting, credit, for, five, victories, before, also, becoming, the, first, ace, to, die, in, action, it, was, german, luftstreitkr, fte, leutnant, kurt, wintgens, who, on, 1, july, 1915, scored, the, very, first, aerial, victory, by, a, purpose, built, fighter, plane, with, a, synchronized, machine, gun, aviators, were, styled, as, modern, day, knights, doing, individual, combat, with, their, enemies, several, pilots, became, famous, for, their, air, to, air, combat, the, most, well, known, is, manfred, von, richthofen, better, known, as, the, red, baron, who, shot, down, 80, planes, in, air, to, air, combat, with, several, different, planes, the, most, celebrated, of, which, was, the, fokker, dr, i, on, the, allied, side, ren, paul, fonck, is, credited, with, the, most, all, time, victories, at, 75, even, when, later, wars, are, considered, france, britain, germany, and, italy, were, the, leading, manufacturers, of, fighter, planes, that, saw, action, during, the, war, with, german, aviation, technologist, hugo, junkers, showing, the, way, to, the, future, through, his, pioneering, use, of, all, metal, aircraft, from, late, 1915, the, years, between, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, saw, great, advancements, in, aircraft, technology, airplanes, evolved, from, low, powered, biplanes, made, from, wood, and, fabric, to, sleek, high, powered, monoplanes, made, of, aluminium, based, primarily, on, the, founding, work, of, hugo, junkers, during, the, world, war, i, period, and, its, adoption, by, american, designer, william, bushnell, stout, and, soviet, designer, andrei, tupolev, the, age, of, the, great, rigid, airships, came, and, went, the, first, successful, rotorcraft, appeared, in, the, form, of, the, autogyro, invented, by, spanish, engineer, juan, de, la, cierva, and, first, flown, in, 1919, in, this, design, the, rotor, is, not, powered, but, is, spun, like, a, windmill, by, its, passage, through, the, air, a, separate, powerplant, is, used, to, propel, the, aircraft, forwards, after, world, war, i, experienced, fighter, pilots, were, eager, to, show, off, their, skills, many, american, pilots, became, barnstormers, flying, into, small, towns, across, the, country, and, showing, off, their, flying, abilities, as, well, as, taking, paying, passengers, for, rides, eventually, the, barnstormers, grouped, into, more, organized, displays, air, shows, sprang, up, around, the, country, with, air, races, acrobatic, stunts, and, feats, of, air, superiority, the, air, races, drove, engine, and, airframe, development, the, schneider, trophy, for, example, led, to, a, series, of, ever, faster, and, sleeker, monoplane, designs, culminating, in, the, supermarine, s, 6b, with, pilots, competing, for, cash, prizes, there, was, an, incentive, to, go, faster, amelia, earhart, was, perhaps, the, most, famous, of, those, on, the, barnstorming, air, show, circuit, she, was, also, the, first, female, pilot, to, achieve, records, such, as, the, crossing, of, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, other, prizes, for, distance, and, speed, records, also, drove, development, forwards, for, example, on, 14, june, 1919, captain, john, alcock, and, lieutenant, arthur, brown, co, piloted, a, vickers, vimy, non, stop, from, st, john, s, newfoundland, to, clifden, ireland, winning, the, 13, 000, 65, 000, northcliffe, prize, the, first, flight, across, the, south, atlantic, and, the, first, aerial, crossing, using, astronomical, navigation, was, made, by, the, naval, aviators, gago, coutinho, and, sacadura, cabral, in, 1922, from, lisbon, portugal, to, rio, de, janeiro, brazil, with, only, internal, means, of, navigation, in, an, aircraft, specifically, fitted, for, himself, with, an, artificial, horizon, for, aeronautical, use, an, invention, that, revolutionized, air, navigation, at, the, time, gago, coutinho, invented, a, type, of, sextant, incorporating, two, spirit, levels, to, provide, an, artificial, horizon, five, years, later, charles, lindbergh, received, the, orteig, prize, of, 25, 000, for, the, first, solo, non, stop, crossing, of, the, atlantic, this, caused, what, was, known, in, aviation, at, the, time, as, the, lindbergh, boom, where, the, volume, of, mail, moving, by, air, increased, 50, percent, applications, for, pilots, licences, tripled, and, the, number, of, planes, quadrupled, all, within, six, months, of, the, flight, about, three, months, after, lindbergh, paul, redfern, was, the, first, to, solo, the, caribbean, sea, and, went, missing, flying, over, venezuela, australian, sir, charles, kingsford, smith, was, the, first, to, fly, across, the, larger, pacific, ocean, in, the, southern, cross, his, crew, left, oakland, california, to, make, the, first, trans, pacific, flight, to, australia, in, three, stages, the, first, from, oakland, to, hawaii, was, 2, 400, miles, 3, 900, km, took, 27, hours, 25, minutes, and, was, uneventful, they, then, flew, to, suva, fiji, 3, 100, miles, 5, 000, km, away, taking, 34, hours, 30, minutes, this, was, the, toughest, part, of, the, journey, as, they, flew, through, a, massive, lightning, storm, near, the, equator, they, then, flew, on, to, brisbane, in, 20, hours, where, they, landed, on, 9, june, 1928, after, approximately, 7, 400, miles, 11, 900, km, total, flight, on, arrival, kingsford, smith, was, met, by, a, huge, crowd, of, 25, 000, at, eagle, farm, airport, in, his, hometown, of, brisbane, accompanying, him, were, australian, aviator, charles, ulm, as, the, relief, pilot, and, the, americans, james, warner, and, captain, harry, lyon, who, were, the, radio, operator, navigator, and, engineer, a, week, after, they, landed, kingsford, smith, and, ulm, recorded, a, disc, for, columbia, talking, about, their, trip, with, ulm, kingsford, smith, later, continued, his, journey, being, the, first, in, 1929, to, circumnavigate, the, world, crossing, the, equator, twice, the, first, lighter, than, air, crossings, of, the, atlantic, were, made, by, airship, in, july, 1919, by, his, majesty, s, airship, r34, and, crew, when, they, flew, from, east, lothian, scotland, to, long, island, new, york, and, then, back, to, pulham, england, by, 1929, airship, technology, had, advanced, to, the, point, that, the, first, round, the, world, flight, was, completed, by, the, graf, zeppelin, in, september, and, in, october, the, same, aircraft, inaugurated, the, first, commercial, transatlantic, service, however, the, age, of, the, rigid, airship, ended, following, the, destruction, by, fire, of, the, zeppelin, lz, 129, hindenburg, just, before, landing, at, lakehurst, new, jersey, on, 6, may, 1937, killing, 35, of, the, 97, people, aboard, previous, spectacular, airship, accidents, from, the, wingfoot, express, disaster, 1919, to, the, loss, of, the, r101, 1930, the, akron, 1933, and, the, macon, 1935, had, already, cast, doubt, on, airship, safety, but, with, the, disasters, of, the, u, s, navy, s, rigids, showing, the, importance, of, solely, using, helium, as, the, lifting, medium, following, the, destruction, of, the, hindenburg, the, remaining, airship, making, international, flights, the, graf, zeppelin, was, retired, june, 1937, its, replacement, the, rigid, airship, graf, zeppelin, ii, made, a, number, of, flights, primarily, over, germany, from, 1938, to, 1939, but, was, grounded, when, germany, began, world, war, ii, both, remaining, german, zeppelins, were, scrapped, in, 1940, to, supply, metal, for, the, german, luftwaffe, the, last, american, rigid, airship, the, los, angeles, which, had, not, flown, since, 1932, was, dismantled, in, late, 1939, meanwhile, germany, which, was, restricted, by, the, treaty, of, versailles, in, its, development, of, powered, aircraft, developed, gliding, as, a, sport, especially, at, the, wasserkuppe, during, the, 1920s, in, its, various, forms, in, the, 21st, century, sailplane, aviation, now, has, over, 400, 000, participants, in, 1929, jimmy, doolittle, developed, instrument, flight, 1929, also, saw, the, first, flight, of, by, far, the, largest, plane, ever, built, until, then, the, dornier, do, x, with, a, wingspan, of, 48, m, on, its, 70th, test, flight, on, 21, october, 1929, there, were, 169, people, on, board, a, record, that, was, not, broken, for, 20, years, less, than, a, decade, after, the, development, of, the, first, practical, rotorcraft, of, any, type, with, the, autogyro, in, the, soviet, union, boris, n, yuriev, and, alexei, m, cheremukhin, two, aeronautical, engineers, working, at, the, tsentralniy, aerogidrodinamicheskiy, institut, constructed, and, flew, the, tsagi, 1, ea, single, rotor, helicopter, which, used, an, open, tubing, framework, a, four, blade, main, rotor, and, twin, sets, of, 1, 8, meter, 5, 9, ft, diameter, anti, torque, rotors, one, set, of, two, at, the, nose, and, one, set, of, two, at, the, tail, powered, by, two, m, 2, powerplants, up, rated, copies, of, the, gnome, monosoupape, rotary, radial, engine, of, world, war, i, the, tsagi, 1, ea, made, several, successful, low, altitude, flights, by, 14, august, 1932, cheremukhin, managed, to, get, the, 1, ea, up, to, an, unofficial, altitude, of, 605, meters, 1, 985, feet, with, what, is, likely, to, be, the, first, successful, single, lift, rotor, helicopter, design, ever, tested, and, flown, only, five, years, after, the, german, dornier, do, x, had, flown, tupolev, designed, the, largest, aircraft, of, the, 1930s, era, the, maksim, gorky, in, the, soviet, union, by, 1934, as, the, largest, aircraft, ever, built, using, the, junkers, methods, of, metal, aircraft, construction, in, the, 1930s, development, of, the, jet, engine, began, in, germany, and, in, britain, both, countries, would, go, on, to, develop, jet, aircraft, by, the, end, of, world, war, ii, after, enrolling, in, the, military, aviation, academy, in, eskisehir, in, 1936, and, undertaking, training, at, the, first, aircraft, regiment, sabiha, g, k, en, flew, fighter, and, bomber, planes, becoming, the, first, turkish, female, aviator, and, the, world, s, first, female, combat, pilot, during, her, flying, career, she, achieved, some, 8, 000, hours, 32, of, which, were, combat, missions, world, war, ii, saw, a, great, increase, in, the, pace, of, development, and, production, not, only, of, aircraft, but, also, the, associated, flight, based, weapon, delivery, systems, air, combat, tactics, and, doctrines, took, advantage, large, scale, strategic, bombing, campaigns, were, launched, fighter, escorts, introduced, and, the, more, flexible, aircraft, and, weapons, allowed, precise, attacks, on, small, targets, with, dive, bombers, fighter, bombers, and, ground, attack, aircraft, new, technologies, like, radar, also, allowed, more, coordinated, and, controlled, deployment, of, air, defence, the, first, jet, aircraft, to, fly, was, the, heinkel, he, 178, germany, flown, by, erich, warsitz, in, 1939, followed, by, the, world, s, first, operational, jet, aircraft, the, messerschmitt, me, 262, in, july, 1942, and, world, s, first, jet, powered, bomber, the, arado, ar, 234, in, june, 1943, british, developments, like, the, gloster, meteor, followed, afterwards, but, saw, only, brief, use, in, world, war, ii, the, first, cruise, missile, v, 1, the, first, ballistic, missile, v, 2, the, first, and, to, date, only, operational, rocket, powered, combat, aircraft, me, 163, with, attained, velocities, of, up, to, 1, 130, km, h, 700, mph, in, test, flights, and, the, first, vertical, take, off, manned, point, defence, interceptor, the, bachem, ba, 349, natter, were, also, developed, by, germany, however, jet, and, rocket, aircraft, had, only, limited, impact, due, to, their, late, introduction, fuel, shortages, the, lack, of, experienced, pilots, and, the, declining, war, industry, of, germany, not, only, aeroplanes, but, also, helicopters, saw, rapid, development, in, the, second, world, war, with, the, introduction, of, the, focke, achgelis, fa, 223, the, flettner, fl, 282, synchropter, in, 1941, in, germany, and, the, sikorsky, r, 4, in, 1942, in, the, usa, after, world, war, ii, commercial, aviation, grew, rapidly, using, mostly, ex, military, aircraft, to, transport, people, and, cargo, this, growth, was, accelerated, by, the, glut, of, heavy, and, super, heavy, bomber, airframes, like, the, b, 29, and, lancaster, that, could, be, converted, into, commercial, aircraft, the, dc, 3, also, made, for, easier, and, longer, commercial, flights, the, first, commercial, jet, airliner, to, fly, was, the, british, de, havilland, comet, by, 1952, the, british, state, airline, boac, had, introduced, the, comet, into, scheduled, service, while, a, technical, achievement, the, plane, suffered, a, series, of, highly, public, failures, as, the, shape, of, the, windows, led, to, cracks, due, to, metal, fatigue, the, fatigue, was, caused, by, cycles, of, pressurization, and, depressurization, of, the, cabin, and, eventually, led, to, catastrophic, failure, of, the, plane, s, fuselage, by, the, time, the, problems, were, overcome, other, jet, airliner, designs, had, already, taken, to, the, skies, ussr, s, aeroflot, became, the, first, airline, in, the, world, to, operate, sustained, regular, jet, services, on, 15, september, 1956, with, the, tupolev, tu, 104, the, boeing, 707, and, dc, 8, which, established, new, levels, of, comfort, safety, and, passenger, expectations, ushered, in, the, age, of, mass, commercial, air, travel, dubbed, the, jet, age, in, october, 1947, chuck, yeager, took, the, rocket, powered, bell, x, 1, through, the, sound, barrier, although, anecdotal, evidence, exists, that, some, fighter, pilots, may, have, done, so, while, dive, bombing, ground, targets, during, the, war, this, was, the, first, controlled, level, flight, to, exceed, the, speed, of, sound, further, barriers, of, distance, fell, in, 1948, and, 1952, with, the, first, jet, crossing, of, the, atlantic, and, the, first, nonstop, flight, to, australia, the, 1945, invention, of, nuclear, bombs, briefly, increased, the, strategic, importance, of, military, aircraft, in, the, cold, war, between, east, and, west, even, a, moderate, fleet, of, long, range, bombers, could, deliver, a, deadly, blow, to, the, enemy, so, great, efforts, were, made, to, develop, countermeasures, at, first, the, supersonic, interceptor, aircraft, were, produced, in, considerable, numbers, by, 1955, most, development, efforts, shifted, to, guided, surface, to, air, missiles, however, the, approach, diametrically, changed, when, a, new, type, of, nuclear, carrying, platform, appeared, that, could, not, be, stopped, in, any, feasible, way, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, the, possibility, of, these, was, demonstrated, in, 1957, with, the, launch, of, sputnik, 1, by, the, soviet, union, this, action, started, the, space, race, between, the, nations, in, 1961, the, sky, was, no, longer, the, limit, for, crewed, flight, as, yuri, gagarin, orbited, once, around, the, planet, within, 108, minutes, and, then, used, the, descent, module, of, vostok, i, to, safely, reenter, the, atmosphere, and, reduce, speed, from, mach, 25, using, friction, and, converting, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, velocity, into, heat, the, united, states, responded, by, launching, alan, shepard, into, space, on, a, suborbital, flight, in, a, mercury, program, space, capsule, with, the, launch, of, the, alouette, i, in, 1963, canada, became, the, third, country, to, send, a, satellite, into, space, the, space, race, between, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, would, ultimately, lead, to, the, landing, of, men, on, the, moon, in, 1969, in, 1967, the, x, 15, set, the, air, speed, record, for, an, aircraft, at, 4, 534, mph, 7, 297, km, h, or, mach, 6, 1, aside, from, vehicles, designed, to, fly, in, outer, space, this, record, was, renewed, by, x, 43, in, the, 21st, century, the, harrier, jump, jet, often, referred, to, as, just, harrier, or, the, jump, jet, is, a, british, designed, military, jet, aircraft, capable, of, vertical, short, takeoff, and, landing, v, stol, via, thrust, vectoring, it, first, flew, in, 1969, the, same, year, that, neil, armstrong, and, buzz, aldrin, set, foot, on, the, moon, and, boeing, unveiled, the, boeing, 747, and, the, a, rospatiale, bac, concorde, supersonic, passenger, airliner, had, its, maiden, flight, the, boeing, 747, was, the, largest, commercial, passenger, aircraft, ever, to, fly, and, still, carries, millions, of, passengers, each, year, though, it, has, been, superseded, by, the, airbus, a380, which, is, capable, of, carrying, up, to, 853, passengers, in, 1975, aeroflot, started, regular, service, on, the, tu, 144, the, first, supersonic, passenger, plane, in, 1976, british, airways, and, air, france, began, supersonic, service, across, the, atlantic, with, concorde, a, few, years, earlier, the, sr, 71, blackbird, had, set, the, record, for, crossing, the, atlantic, in, under, 2, hours, and, concorde, followed, in, its, footsteps, in, 1979, the, gossamer, albatross, became, the, first, human, powered, aircraft, to, cross, the, english, channel, this, achievement, finally, saw, the, realization, of, centuries, of, dreams, of, human, flight, the, last, quarter, of, the, 20th, century, saw, a, change, of, emphasis, no, longer, was, revolutionary, progress, made, in, flight, speeds, distances, and, materials, technology, this, part, of, the, century, instead, saw, the, spreading, of, the, digital, revolution, both, in, flight, avionics, and, in, aircraft, design, and, manufacturing, techniques, in, 1986, dick, rutan, and, jeana, yeager, flew, an, aircraft, the, rutan, voyager, around, the, world, unrefuelled, and, without, landing, in, 1999, bertrand, piccard, became, the, first, person, to, circle, the, earth, in, a, balloon, digital, fly, by, wire, systems, allow, an, aircraft, to, be, designed, with, relaxed, static, stability, initially, used, to, increase, the, manoeuvrability, of, military, aircraft, such, as, the, general, dynamics, f, 16, fighting, falcon, this, is, now, being, used, to, reduce, drag, on, commercial, airliners, the, u, s, centennial, of, flight, commission, was, established, in, 1999, to, encourage, the, broadest, national, and, international, participation, in, the, celebration, of, 100, years, of, powered, flight, it, publicized, and, encouraged, a, number, of, programmes, projects, and, events, intended, to, educate, people, about, the, history, of, aviation, 21st, century, aviation, has, seen, increasing,
