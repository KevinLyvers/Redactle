record, keeping, began, in, the, mid, nineteenth, century, that, autumn, further, heavy, rain, added, to, the, problem, and, some, rivers, did, not, return, to, their, normal, courses, until, november, the, floods, inundated, approximately, 180, 000, square, kilometres, 69, 000, sq, mi, an, area, equivalent, in, size, to, england, and, half, of, scotland, or, the, states, of, new, york,

beyond, the, core, flood, zone, areas, as, far, south, as, guangdong, as, far, north, as, manchuria, and, as, far, west, as, sichuan, were, also, inundated, this, flood, is, frequently, featured, in, the, list, of, disasters, in, china, by, death, toll, sometimes, topping, lists, of, the, world, s, deadliest, disasters, at, the, time, the, government, estimated, that, 25, million, people, had, been, affected, by, the, flood, historians, since, have, suggested, that, the, true, number, may, have, been, as, many, as, 53, million, estimated, death, tolls, also, vary, widely, contemporary, studies, conducted, by, john, lossing, buck, allege, that, at, least, 150, 000, people, had, drowned, in, the, first, few, months, of, the, flood, with, hundreds, of, thousands, more, dying, of,

weeds, and, earth, some, sold, their, children, to, survive, while, others, resorted, to, cannibalism, the, most, lethal, effect, of, the, flood, was, the, diseases, that, swept, through, the, refugee, population, due, to, displacement, overcrowding, and, the, breakdown, of, sanitation, these, included, cholera, measles, malaria, dysentery, and, schistosomiasis, as, well, as, inundating, rural, areas, the, flood, caused, widespread, destruction, to, a, number, of, cities, refugees, had, been, arriving, in, the, city, of, wuhan, since, the, late, spring, when, the, city, itself, was, inundated, in, the, early, summer, and, after, a, catastrophic, dike, failure, at, just, before, 6, 00, am, on, 27, july, 270, around, 782, 189, urban, citizens, and, rural, refugees, were, left,

gathered, on, flood, islands, throughout, the, city, with, 30, 000, sheltering, on, a, railway, embankment, in, central, hankou, with, little, food, and, a, complete, breakdown, in, sanitation, thousands, soon, began, to, succumb, to, diseases, there, was, no, warning, only, a, sudden, great, wall, of, water, most, of, wuhan, s, buildings, in, those, days, were, only, one, story, high, and, for, many, people, there, was, no, escape, they, died, by, the, tens, of, thousands, i, was, just, coming, off, duty, at, the, company, s, main, office, a, fairly, new, three, story, building, near, the, center, of, town, when, i, heard, the, terrible, noise, and, saw, the, wall, of, water, coming, i, raced, to, the, top, story, of, the, building, i, was, in, one, of, the, tallest, and, strongest, buildings, left, standing, at, that, time, no, one, knew, whether, the, water, would, subside, or, rise, even, higher, the, city, of, nanjing, then, the, capital, of, republican, china, was, also, severely, affected, by, the, disaster, one, of, the, most, disastrous, single, events, during, the, flood, occurred, on, 25, august, 1931, when, the, water, rushing, through, the, grand, canal, washed, away, dikes, near, gaoyou, lake, in, gaoyou, county, alone, 18, 000, people, drowned, and, 58, 000, died, due, to, famine, and, diseases, the, following, year, thomas, harnsberger, a, missionary, of, the, presbyterian, church, in, taizhou, jiangsu, was, one, of, the, two, central, figures, alongside, general, wang, shuxiang, a, phd, in, hydraulics, who, supervised, the, rebuilding, of, the, dikes, at, lake, gaoyou, as, well, as, securing, the, funds, for, it, however, the, flood, remains, widely, unknown, to, the, chinese, steve, harnsberger, the, grandson, of, thomas, harnsberger, wrote, in, 2007, the, 1931, flood, killed, 15, times, the, number, of, people, lost, in, the, indonesian, tsunamis, of, december, 2004, and, yet, scarcely, a, word, has, been, written, of, it, history, focused, instead, on, other, disasters, that, year, china, s, attention, was, on, a, civil, war, between, the, communists, and, nationalists, and, the, japanese, were, invading, in, the, north, while, the, world, was, deep, into, the, great, depression, the, 1931, flood, was, one, of, the, first, major, tests, for, the, kuomintang, government, as, the, scale, of, the, disaster, became, apparent, the, government, established, the, national, flood, relief, commission, under, the, auspices, of, t, v, soong, a, prominent, politician, in, the, kuomintang, and, brother, in, law, of, chiang, kai, shek, the, commission, employed, a, range, of, chinese, and, foreign, experts, including, figures, such, as, famous, epidemiologist, wu, liande, health, minister, liu, ruiheng, public, health, worker, john, grant, and, hydraulic, engineer, oliver, todd, it, also, secured, the, assistance, of, the, league, of, nations, even, the, famous, aviators, charles, lindbergh, and, his, wife, anne, lindbergh, became, involved, as, they, were, commissioned, to, conduct, an, aerial, survey, of, the, flood, zone, although, song, ziwen, remained, the, head, of, the, commission, the, day, to, day, running, the, relief, effort, was, entrusted, to, john, hope, simpson, a, british, refugee, expert, charity, poured, in, to, help, with, the, relief, effort, from, throughout, the, world, with, overseas, chinese, communities, in, southeast, asia, being, particularly, generous, in, the, united, states, the, celebrated, author, pearl, buck, wrote, short, stories, to, encourage, charitable, donations, the, relief, effort, became, much, more, difficult, following, the, japanese, invasion, of, manchuria, in, the, autumn, of, 1931, which, caused, the, chinese, bond, market, to, collapse, eventually, the, government, managed, to, secure, a, large, loan, of, wheat, and, flour, from, the, united, states, in, the, wake, of, the, disaster, the, government, set, up, organizations, such, as, the, huai, river, conservancy, commission, to, address, flood, problems, however, due, to, a, lack, of, funding, and, the, chaos, of, the, second, sino, japanese, war, and, the, subsequent, chinese, civil, war, the, various, commissions, were, only, able, to, construct, small, dams, along, the, yangtze, river, as, part, of, an, anti, superstition, campaign, by, the, kuomintang, government, a, dragon, king, temple, was, demolished, in, wuhan, shortly, before, the, flood, hit, this, coincidence, led, to, widespread, discontent, afterwards, as, many, locals, linked, the, disaster, to, the, anger, of, dragon, king, a, rainmaking, deity, as, a, response, prominent, officials, including, he, baohua, mayor, of, wuhan, and, xia, douyin, then, the, local, garrison, commander, and, later, governor, of, hubei, province, held, ritual, ceremonies, and, kowtowed, to, the, deity, meanwhile, many, believed, that, evacuation, efforts, were, hindered, by, superstition, according, to, a, contemporary, report, thousands, are, convinced, that, hankow, is, doomed, and, refuse, to, help, themselves, or, be, helped, they, sit, stoically, awaiting, death, in, 1953, after, the, end, of, the, chinese, civil, war, chinese, communist, party, leader, mao, zedong, travelled, to, areas, neighbouring, the, yangtze, river, to, promote, the, three, gorges, dam, flood, control, project, the, socialist, three, gorges, dam, project, should, excel, other, major, projects, in, chinese, history, such, as, qin, shi, huang, s, great, wall, and, sui, yang, di, s, grand, canal, he, stated, scientists, and, officials, who, raised, doubts, such, as, chen, mingshu, were, persecuted, as, rightists, li, siguang, a, prominent, scientist, and, minister, of, geological, resources, told, mao, he, would, commit, suicide, if, he, could, not, stop, the, construction, of, the, dam, the, project, did, not, move, beyond, the, planning, stage, in, mao, s, time, due, to, a, lack, of, resources, rising, sino, soviet, tensions, and, the, disruptions, of, the, great, leap, forward, the, project, was, restarted, in, the, 1980s, and, the, hydroelectric, three, gorges, dam, began, full, operation, in, 2012, becoming, the, world, s, largest, power, station, in, terms, of, installed, capacity
