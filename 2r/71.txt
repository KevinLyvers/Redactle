the, upper, paleolithic, or, upper, palaeolithic, is, the, third, and, last, subdivision, of, the, paleolithic, or, old, stone, age, very, broadly, it, dates, to, between, 50, 000, and, 12, 000, years, ago, the, beginning, of, the, holocene, according, to, some, theories, coinciding, with, the, appearance, of, behavioral, modernity, in, early, modern, humans, until, the, advent, of, the, neolithic, revolution, and, agriculture, anatomically, modern, humans, i, e, homo, sapiens, are, believed, to, have, emerged, in, africa, around, 300, 000, years, ago, it, has, been, argued, by, some, that, their, ways, of, life, changed, relatively, little, from, that, of, archaic, humans, of, the, middle, paleolithic, until, about, 50, 000, years, ago, when, there, was, a, marked, increase, in, the, diversity, of, artefacts, found, associated, with, modern, human, remains, this, period, coincides, with, the, most, common, date, assigned, to, expansion, of, modern, humans, from, africa, throughout, asia, and, eurasia, which, contributed, to, the, extinction, of, the, neanderthals, the, upper, paleolithic, has, the, earliest, known, evidence, of, organized, settlements, in, the, form, of, campsites, some, with, storage, pits, artistic, work, blossomed, with, cave, painting, petroglyphs, carvings, and, engravings, on, bone, or, ivory, the, first, evidence, of, human, fishing, is, also, found, from, artefacts, in, places, such, as, blombos, cave, in, south, africa, more, complex, social, groupings, emerged, supported, by, more, varied, and, reliable, food, sources, and, specialized, tool, types, this, probably, contributed, to, increasing, group, identification, or, ethnicity, the, peopling, of, australia, most, likely, took, place, before, c, 60, ka, europe, was, peopled, after, c, 45, ka, anatomically, modern, humans, are, known, to, have, expanded, northward, into, siberia, as, far, as, the, 58th, parallel, by, about, 45, ka, ust, ishim, man, the, upper, paleolithic, is, divided, by, the, last, glacial, maximum, lgm, from, about, 25, to, 15, ka, the, peopling, of, the, americas, occurred, during, this, time, with, east, and, central, asia, populations, reaching, the, bering, land, bridge, after, about, 35, ka, and, expanding, into, the, americas, by, about, 15, ka, in, western, eurasia, the, paleolithic, eases, into, the, so, called, epipaleolithic, or, mesolithic, from, the, end, of, the, lgm, beginning, 15, ka, the, holocene, glacial, retreat, begins, 11, 7, ka, 10th, millennium, bc, falling, well, into, the, old, world, epipaleolithic, and, marking, the, beginning, of, the, earliest, forms, of, farming, in, the, fertile, crescent, both, homo, erectus, and, neanderthals, used, the, same, crude, stone, tools, archaeologist, richard, g, klein, who, has, worked, extensively, on, ancient, stone, tools, describes, the, stone, tool, kit, of, archaic, hominids, as, impossible, to, categorize, he, argues, that, almost, everywhere, whether, asia, africa, or, europe, before, 50, 000, years, ago, all, the, stone, tools, are, much, alike, and, unsophisticated, firstly, among, the, artefacts, of, africa, archeologists, found, they, could, differentiate, and, classify, those, of, less, than, 50, 000, years, into, many, different, categories, such, as, projectile, points, engraving, tools, knife, blades, and, drilling, and, piercing, tools, these, new, stone, tool, types, have, been, described, as, being, distinctly, differentiated, from, each, other, each, tool, had, a, specific, purpose, the, early, modern, humans, who, expanded, into, europe, commonly, referred, to, as, the, cro, magnons, left, many, sophisticated, stone, tools, carved, and, engraved, pieces, on, bone, ivory, and, antler, cave, paintings, and, venus, figurines, the, neanderthals, continued, to, use, mousterian, stone, tool, technology, and, possibly, ch, telperronian, technology, these, tools, disappeared, from, the, archeological, record, at, around, the, same, time, the, neanderthals, themselves, disappeared, from, the, fossil, record, about, 40, 000, cal, bp, settlements, were, often, located, in, narrow, valley, bottoms, possibly, associated, with, hunting, of, passing, herds, of, animals, some, of, them, may, have, been, occupied, year, round, though, more, commonly, they, appear, to, have, been, used, seasonally, people, moved, between, the, sites, to, exploit, different, food, sources, at, different, times, of, the, year, hunting, was, important, and, caribou, wild, reindeer, may, well, be, the, species, of, single, greatest, importance, in, the, entire, anthropological, literature, on, hunting, technological, advances, included, significant, developments, in, flint, tool, manufacturing, with, industries, based, on, fine, blades, rather, than, simpler, and, shorter, flakes, burins, and, racloirs, were, used, to, work, bone, antler, and, hides, advanced, darts, and, harpoons, also, appear, in, this, period, along, with, the, fish, hook, the, oil, lamp, rope, and, the, eyed, needle, fishing, of, pelagic, fish, species, and, navigating, the, open, ocean, is, evidenced, by, sites, from, timor, and, buka, solomon, islands, the, changes, in, human, behavior, have, been, attributed, to, changes, in, climate, encompassing, a, number, of, global, temperature, drops, these, led, to, a, worsening, of, the, already, bitter, cold, of, the, last, glacial, period, popularly, but, incorrectly, called, the, last, ice, age, such, changes, may, have, reduced, the, supply, of, usable, timber, and, forced, people, to, look, at, other, materials, in, addition, flint, becomes, brittle, at, low, temperatures, and, may, not, have, functioned, as, a, tool, some, notational, signs, used, next, to, images, of, animals, may, have, appeared, as, early, as, the, upper, palaeolithic, in, europe, circa, 35, 000, bce, and, may, be, the, earliest, proto, writing, several, symbols, were, used, in, combination, as, a, way, to, convey, seasonal, behavioural, information, about, hunted, animals, lines, and, dots, were, apparently, used, interchangeably, to, denote, lunar, months, while, the, y, sign, apparently, signified, to, give, birth, these, characters, were, seemingly, combined, to, convey, the, breeding, period, of, hunted, animals, the, climate, of, the, period, in, europe, saw, dramatic, changes, and, included, the, last, glacial, maximum, the, coldest, phase, of, the, last, glacial, period, which, lasted, from, about, 26, 5, to, 19, kya, being, coldest, at, the, end, before, relatively, rapid, warming, all, dates, vary, somewhat, for, different, areas, and, in, different, studies, during, the, maximum, most, of, northern, europe, was, covered, by, an, ice, sheet, forcing, human, populations, into, the, areas, known, as, last, glacial, maximum, refugia, including, modern, italy, and, the, balkans, parts, of, the, iberian, peninsula, and, areas, around, the, black, sea, this, period, saw, cultures, such, as, the, solutrean, in, france, and, spain, human, life, may, have, continued, on, top, of, the, ice, sheet, but, we, know, next, to, nothing, about, it, and, very, little, about, the, human, life, that, preceded, the, european, glaciers, in, the, early, part, of, the, period, up, to, about, 30, kya, the, mousterian, pluvial, made, northern, africa, including, the, sahara, well, watered, and, with, lower, temperatures, than, today, after, the, end, of, the, pluvial, the, sahara, became, arid, the, last, glacial, maximum, was, followed, by, the, aller, d, oscillation, a, warm, and, moist, global, interstadial, that, occurred, around, 13, 5, to, 13, 8, kya, then, there, was, a, very, rapid, onset, perhaps, within, as, little, as, a, decade, of, the, cold, and, dry, younger, dryas, climate, period, giving, sub, arctic, conditions, to, much, of, northern, europe, the, preboreal, rise, in, temperatures, also, began, sharply, around, 10, 3, kya, and, by, its, end, around, 9, 0, kya, had, brought, temperatures, nearly, to, present, day, levels, although, the, climate, was, wetter, this, period, saw, the, upper, paleolithic, give, way, to, the, start, of, the, following, mesolithic, cultural, period, as, the, glaciers, receded, sea, levels, rose, the, english, channel, irish, sea, and, north, sea, were, land, at, this, time, and, the, black, sea, a, fresh, water, lake, in, particular, the, atlantic, coastline, was, initially, far, out, to, sea, in, modern, terms, in, most, areas, though, the, mediterranean, coastline, has, retreated, far, less, except, in, the, north, of, the, adriatic, and, the, aegean, the, rise, in, sea, levels, continued, until, at, least, 7, 5, kya, 5500, bc, so, evidence, of, human, activity, along, europe, s, coasts, in, the, upper, paleolithic, is, mostly, lost, though, some, traces, have, been, recovered, by, fishing, boats, and, marine, archaeology, especially, from, doggerland, the, lost, area, beneath, the, north, sea, the, first, direct, evidence, for, neanderthals, hunting, cave, lions, this, is, based, on, a, cave, lion, skeleton, found, in, seigsdorf, germany, which, has, hunting, lesions, 14, 000, bp, fertile, crescent, europe, africa, siberia, the, upper, paleolithic, in, the, franco, cantabrian, region
