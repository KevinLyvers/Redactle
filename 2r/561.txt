governments, in, the, eastern, bloc, and, other, parts, of, the, world, this, revolutionary, wave, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, autumn, of, nations, a, play, on, the, term, spring, of, nations, that, is, sometimes, used, to, describe, the, revolutions, of, 1848, in, europe, the, revolutions, of, 1989, contributed, to, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, one, of, the, two,

which, the, eastern, bloc, disintegrated, this, led, to, mass, demonstrations, in, cities, of, east, germany, such, as, leipzig, and, subsequently, to, the, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, in, november, 1989, which, served, as, the, symbolic, gateway, to, german, reunification, in, 1990, one, feature, common, to, most, of, these, developments, was, the, extensive, use, of, campaigns, of, civil, resistance, demonstrating, popular, opposition, to, the, continuation, of, one, party, rule, and, contributing, to, pressure, for, change, romania, was, the, only, country, in, which, citizens, and,

leninism, in, 1992, the, cold, war, is, considered, to, have, officially, ended, on, 3, december, 1989, during, the, malta, summit, between, the, soviet, and, american, leaders, however, many, historians, argue, that, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, on, 26, december, 1991, was, the, end, of, the, cold, war, the, impact, of, these, events, were, felt, in, many, third, world,

of, market, economy, under, market, socialism, the, european, political, landscape, changed, drastically, with, several, former, eastern, bloc, countries, joining, nato, and, the, european, union, resulting, in, stronger, economic, and, social, integration, with, western, europe, and, north, america, many, communist, and, socialist, organisations, in, the, west, turned, their, guiding,

were, only, permitted, within, a, narrow, spectrum, dictated, by, the, state, the, general, public, in, the, eastern, bloc, was, still, subject, to, secret, police, and, political, repression, gorbachev, urged, his, central, and, southeast, european, counterparts, to, imitate, perestroika, and, glasnost, in, their, own, countries, however, while, reformists, in, hungary, and, poland, were, emboldened, by, the, force, of, liberalization, spreading, from, the, east, other, eastern, bloc, countries, remained, openly, skeptical, and, demonstrated, aversion, to, reform, believing, gorbachev,

of, east, germany, and, the, non, intervention, of, the, soviet, union, broke, the, dams, now, tens, of, thousands, of, the, media, informed, east, germans, made, their, way, to, hungary, which, was, no, longer, ready, to, keep, its, borders, completely, closed, or, to, oblige, its, border, troops, to, use, force, of, arms, by, the, end, of, september, 1989, more, than, 30, 000, east, germans, had, escaped, to, the, west, before, the, gdr, denied, travel, to, hungary, leaving, czechoslovakia, as, the, only, neighboring, state, to, which, east, germans, could, escape, thousands, of, east, germans, tried, to, reach, the, west, by, occupying, the, west, german, diplomatic, facilities, in, other, central, and, eastern, european, capitals, notably, the, prague, embassy, and, the, hungarian, embassy, where, thousands, camped, in, the, muddy, garden, from, august, to, november, waiting, for, german, political, reform, the, gdr, closed, the, border, to, czechoslovakia, on, 3, october, thereby, isolating, itself, from, all, its, neighbors, having, been, shut, off, from, their, last, chance, for, escape, an, increasing, number, of, east, germans, participated, in, the, monday, demonstrations, in, leipzig, on, 4, 11, and, 18, september, each, attracting, 1, 200, to, 1, 500, demonstrators, many, were, arrested, and, beaten, but, the, people, refused, to, be,

visited, east, germany, to, mark, the, 40th, anniversary, of, the, german, democratic, republic, and, urged, the, east, german, leadership, to, accept, reform, a, famous, quote, of, his, is, rendered, in, german, as, wer, zu, sp, t, kommt, den, bestraft, das, leben, the, one, who, comes, too, late, is, punished, by, life, however, honecker, remained, opposed, to, internal, reform, with, his,

suppress, the, civilian, protests, by, 1989, the, soviet, government, deemed, it, impractical, for, the, soviet, union, to, continue, asserting, its, control, over, the, eastern, bloc, so, it, took, a, neutral, stance, regarding, the, events, happening, in, east, germany, soviet, troops, stationed, in, eastern, europe, were, under, strict, instructions, from, the, soviet, leadership, not, to,

rendered, useless, as, the, new, russian, government, began, taking, over, what, remained, of, it, including, the, kremlin, the, penultimate, step, came, on, 1, december, when, voters, in, the, second, most, powerful, republic, ukraine, overwhelmingly, voted, to, secede, from, the, soviet, union, in, a, referendum, this, ended, any, realistic, chance, of, keeping, the, soviet, union,

dissolving, itself, and, the, soviet, union, as, a, political, entity, by, the, end, of, 1991, the, few, soviet, institutions, that, hadn, t, been, taken, over, by, russia, had, dissolved, the, soviet, union, was, officially, disbanded, breaking, up, into, fifteen, constituent, parts, thereby, ending, the, world, s, largest, and, most, influential, socialist, state, and, leaving, to, china, that, position, in, 1993, a, constitutional, crisis, dissolved, into, violence, in, moscow, as, the, russian, armed, forces, were, called, in, to, reestablish, order, estonia, latvia, and, lithuania, implemented, democratic, reforms, and, achieved, independence, from, the, soviet, union, the, singing, revolution, is, a, commonly, used, name, for, events, between, 1987, and, 1991, that, led, to, the, restoration, of, the, independence, of, estonia, latvia, and, lithuania, the, term, was, coined, by, an, estonian, activist, and, artist, heinz, valk, in, an, article, published, a, week, after,

january, events, in, lithuania, and, the, barricades, in, latvia, the, baltic, states, contended, that, their, incorporation, into, the, soviet, union, had, been, illegal, under, both, international, law, and, their, own, law, and, they, were, reasserting, an, independence, that, still, legally, existed, soon, after, the, launching, of, the, august, coup, estonia, and, latvia, declared, full, independence, by, the, time, the, coup, failed, the, ussr, was, no, longer, unified, enough, to, mount, a, forceful, resistance, and, it, recognized, the, independence, of, the, baltic, states, on, 6, september, 1991, all, countries, in, the, region, regained, their, independence, in, 1991, following, the, takeover, by, the, red, army, in, 1920, 21, in, chechnya, an, autonomous, republic, within,

dudayev, staged, a, largely, bloodless, revolution, and, ended, up, forcing, the, resignation, of, the, communist, republican, president, dudayev, was, elected, in, a, landslide, in, the, following, election, in, november, 1991, he, proclaimed, checheno, ingushetia, s, independence, as, the, republic, of, ichkeria, ingushetia, voted, to, leave, the, union, with, chechnya, and, was, allowed, to,

coup, landing, shevardnadze, in, power, the, chechens, with, considerable, assistance, from, the, populations, of, both, former, soviet, countries, and, from, sunni, muslim, countries, repelled, the, invasion, and, a, peace, treaty, was, signed, in, 1997, however, chechnya, became, increasingly, anarchic, largely, due, to, both, the, political, and, physical, destruction, of, the, state, during, the, invasion, and, general, shamil, basaev, having, evaded, all, control, by, the, central, government, conducted, raids, into, neighboring, dagestan, which, russia, used, as, a, pretext, for, reinvading, ichkeria, ichkeria, was, then, reincorporated, into, russia, as, chechnya, again, some, of, the, more, notable, post, soviet, conflicts, include, the, tajikistani, civil, war, the, first,

triggering, serious, interstate, conflicts, posed, a, major, threat, to, regional, and, international, security, for, years, ahead, reforms, in, the, soviet, union, and, its, allied, countries, also, led, to, dramatic, changes, to, communist, and, socialist, states, outside, of, europe, countries, that, retained, socialist, styled, economies, and, government, structures, beyond, 1991, many, soviet, supported, political, parties, and, militant, groups, around, the, world, suffered, from, demoralization, and, loss, of, financing, concurrently, many, anti, communist, authoritarian, states,

just, a, few, places, even, attempted, to, exclude, members, of, communist, secret, services, from, decision, making, in, a, number, of, countries, the, communist, party, simply, changed, its, name, and, continued, to, function, in, several, european, countries, however, endorsing, or, attempting, to, justify, crimes, committed, by, communist, regimes, became, punishable, by, up, to, three, years, of, imprisonment, state, run, enterprises, in, socialist, countries, had, little, or, no, interest, in, producing, what, customers, wanted, which, resulted, in, shortages, of, goods, and, services, in, the, early, 1990s, the, general, view, was, that, there, was, no, precedent, for, moving, from, socialism, to, capitalism, and, only, some, elderly, people, remembered, how, a, market, economy, worked, as, a, result, the, view, that, central, southeastern, and, eastern, europe, would, stay, poor, for, decades, was, common, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, and, the, breakdown, of, economic, ties, which, followed, led, to, a, severe, economic, crisis, and, catastrophic, fall, in, the, standards, of, living, in, the, 1990s, in, post, soviet, states, and, the, former, eastern, bloc, even, before, russia, s, financial, crisis, of, 1998, russia, s, gdp, was, half, of, what, it, had, been, in, the, early, 1990s, there, was, a, temporary, fall, of, output, in, the, official,

similar, fashion, to, the, eastern, european, counterparts, armenia, declared, its, decision, to, join, the, customs, union, and, the, common, economic, space, of, belarus, kazakhstan, and, russia, and, participated, in, the, formation, of, the, eurasian, economic, union, effective, from, 2015, armenia, joined, the, treaty, on, the, eurasian, economic, union, chinese, economic, liberalization, began, in, 1978, and, has, helped, lift, millions, of, people, out, of, poverty, bringing, the, poverty, rate, down, from, 53, of, the, population, in, the, mao, era, to, 12, in, 1981, deng, s,

great, doubling, he, calculated, that, the, size, of, the, global, workforce, doubled, from, 1, 46, billion, workers, to, 2, 93, billion, workers, an, immediate, effect, was, a, reduced, ratio, of, capital, to, labor, in, the, long, term, china, india, and, the, former, soviet, bloc, will, save, and, invest, and, contribute, to, the, expansion, of, the, world, capital, stock, as, of, 2008, nearly, half, of, russians, viewed, stalin, positively, and, many, supported, restoration, of, his, previously, dismantled, monuments, in, 1992, president, yeltsin, s, government, invited, vladimir, bukovsky, to, serve, as, an, expert, to, testify, at, the, cpsu, trial, by, the, constitutional, court, of, russia, where, the, communists, were, suing, yeltsin, for, banning, their, party, the, respondent, s, case, was, that, the, cpsu, itself, had, been, an, unconstitutional, organization, to, prepare, for, his, testimony, bukovsky, requested, and, was, granted, access, to, a, large, number, of, documents, from, soviet, archives, then, reorganized, into, the, tskhsd, using, a, small, handheld, scanner, and, a, laptop, computer, he, managed, to, secretly, scan, many, documents, some, with, high, security, clearance, including, kgb, reports, to, the, central, committee, and, smuggle, the, files, to, the, west, the, events, caught, many, people, by, surprise, before, 1991, many, thought, that, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, was, impossible, bartlomiej, kaminski, s, book, the, collapse, of, state, socialism, argued, that, the, state, socialist, system, has, a, lethal, paradox, saying, that, policy, actions, designed, to, improve, performance, only, accelerate, its, decay, by, the, end, of, 1989, revolts, had, spread, from, one, capital, to, another, ousting, the, regimes, imposed, on, central, south, east, and, eastern, europe, after, world, war, ii, even, the, isolationist, stalinist, regime, in, albania, was, unable, to, stem, the, tide, gorbachev, s, abrogation, of, the, brezhnev, doctrine, was, perhaps, the, key, factor, that, enabled, the, popular, uprisings, to, succeed, once, it, became, evident, that, the, feared, soviet, army, would, not, intervene, to, crush, dissent, the, central, south, east, and, eastern, european, regimes, were, exposed, as, vulnerable, in, the, face, of, popular, uprisings, against, the, one, party, system, and, power, of, secret, police, in, 1990, coit, d, blacker, wrote, that, the, soviet, leadership, appeared, to, have, believed, that, whatever, loss, of, authority, the, soviet, union, might, suffer, in, central, and, south, east, europe, would, be, more, than, offset, by, a, net, increase, in, its, influence, in, western, europe, nevertheless, it, is, unlikely, that, gorbachev, ever, intended, for, the, complete, dismantling, of, communism, and, the, warsaw, pact, rather, gorbachev, assumed, that, the, communist, parties, of, central, and, south, east, europe, could, be, reformed, in, a, similar, way, to, the, reforms, he, hoped, to, achieve, in, the, cpsu, just, as, perestroika, was, aimed, at, making, the, soviet, union, more, efficient, economically, and, politically, gorbachev, believed, that, the, comecon, and, warsaw, pact, could, be, reformed, into, more, effective, entities, however, alexander, yakovlev, a, close, advisor, to, gorbachev, later, stated, that, it, would, have, been, absurd, to, keep, the, system, in, central, and, south, east, europe, yakovlev, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, soviet, dominated, comecon, could, not, work, on, non, market, principles, and, that, the, warsaw, pact, had, no, relevance, to, real, life, in, retrospect, authoritarian, regimes, such, as, the, soviet, union, are, more, likely, to, be, subject, to, economic, sanctions, by, democratic, nations, creating, a, riskier, vulnerability, to, collapse, in, 1991, timur, kuran, wrote, that, generally, leaders, were, despised, and, failed, to, meet, expectations, of, freedoms, and, economic, prosperity, that, they, had, promised, leading, to, citizen, motivation, to, upheave, the, government, economic, distress, mirrored, across, most, regimes,
