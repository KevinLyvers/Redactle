in, the, establishment, of, the, iberian, union, a, forced, union, between, the, two, crowns, that, lasted, until, 1640, when, portugal, regained, its, independence, from, spain, the, structure, of, governance, of, its, overseas, empire, was, significantly, reformed, in, the, late, 18th, century, by, the, bourbon, monarchs, although, the, crown, of, castile, attempted, to, keep, its, empire, a, closed, economic, system, under, habsburg, rule, castile, was, unable, to, supply, the, indies, with, sufficient, consumer, goods, to, meet, demand, this, allowed, foreign, merchants, from, genoa, france, england, germany, and, the, netherlands, to, take, advantage, of, the, trade, with, silver, from, the, mines, of, peru, and, new, spain, flowing, to, other, parts, of, europe, the, merchant,

status, they, successfully, pursued, expansion, in, iberia, in, the, christian, conquest, of, the, muslim, emirate, of, granada, completed, in, 1492, for, which, valencia, born, pope, alexander, vi, gave, them, the, title, of, the, catholic, monarchs, ferdinand, of, aragon, was, particularly, concerned, with, expansion, in, france, and, italy, as, well, as, conquests, in, north, africa, the,

non, political, concept, and, following, the, medieval, tradition, the, term, spain, could, refer, to, the, entire, iberian, peninsula, the, term, catholic, monarchy, spanish, monarqu, a, cat, lica, already, mentioned, in, a, 1494, papal, bull, was, common, during, the, reign, of, holy, roman, emperor, charles, v, insofar, as, the, regime, strived, towards, the, realization, of, the, idea, of, universal, that, is, catholic, monarchy, later, in, time, other, denominations, such, as, spanish, monarchy, spanish, monarqu, a, espa, ola, or, monarchy, of, spain, spanish, monarqu, a, de, espa, a,

focused, on, the, inherited, kingdoms, and, other, possessions, with, the, ottoman, turks, controlling, the, choke, points, of, the, overland, trade, from, asia, and, the, middle, east, both, spain, and, portugal, sought, alternative, routes, the, kingdom, of, portugal, had, an, advantage, over, the, crown, of, castile, having, earlier, retaken, territory, from, the, muslims, following, portugal, s, earlier, completion, of, the, reconquest, and, its, establishment, of, settled, boundaries, it, began, to, seek, overseas, expansion, first, to, the, port, of, ceuta, 1415, and, then, by, colonizing, the, atlantic, islands, of, madeira, 1418, and, the, azores, 1427, 1452, it, also, began, voyages, down, the, west, coast, of, africa, in, the, fifteenth, century, its, rival, castile, laid, claim, to, the, canary, islands, 1402, and, retook, territory, from, the, moors, in, 1462, the, christian, rivals, castile, and, portugal, came, to, formal, agreements, over, the, division, of, new, territories, in, the, treaty, of, alca, ovas, 1479, as, well, as, securing, the, crown, of, castile, for, isabella, whose, accession, was, challenged, militarily, by, portugal, following, the, voyage, of, christopher, columbus, in, 1492, and, first, major, settlement, in, the, new, world, in, 1493, portugal, and, castile, divided, the, world, by, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, 1494, which, gave, portugal, africa, and, asia, and, the, western, hemisphere, to, spain, the, voyage, of, columbus, a, genoese, mariner, obtained, the, support, of, isabella, of, castile, sailing, west, in, 1492,

followed, with, gold, beginning, to, flow, into, castile, s, coffers, managing, the, expanding, empire, became, an, administrative, issue, the, reign, of, ferdinand, and, isabella, began, the, professionalization, of, the, apparatus, of, government, in, spain, which, led, to, a, demand, for, men, of, letters, letrados, who, were, university, graduates, licenciados, of, salamanca, valladolid, complutense, and, alcal, these, lawyer, bureaucrats, staffed, the, various, councils, of, state, eventually, including, the, council, of, the, indies, and, casa, de, contrataci, n, the, two, highest, bodies, in, metropolitan, spain, for, the, government, of, the, empire, in, the, new, world, as, well, as, royal, government, in, the, indies, during, the, last, 250, years, of, the, reconquista, era, the, castilian, monarchy, tolerated, the, small, moorish, taifa, client, kingdom, of, granada, in, the, south, east, by, exacting, tributes, of, gold, the, parias, in, so, doing, they, ensured, that, gold, from, the, niger, region, of, africa, entered, europe, when, king, ferdinand, and, queen, isabella, i, captured, granada, in, 1492, they, implemented, policies, to, maintain, control, of, the, territory, to, do, so, the, monarchy, implemented, a, system, of, encomienda, encomienda, was, a, method, of, land, control, and, distribution, based, upon, vassalic, ties, land, would, be, granted, to, a, noble, family, who, were, then, responsible, for, farming, and, defending, it, this, eventually, led, to, a, large, land, based, aristocracy, a, separate, ruling, class, that, the, crown, later, tried, to, eliminate, in, its, overseas, colonies, by, implementing, this, method, of, political, organization, the, crown, was, able, to, implement, new, forms, of, private, property, without, completely, replacing, already, existing, systems, such, as, the, communal, use, of, resources, after, the, military, and, political, conquest, there, was, an, emphasis, on, religious, conquest, as, well, leading, to, the, creation, of, the, spanish, inquisition, although, the, inquisition, was, technically, a, part, of, the, catholic, church, ferdinand, and, isabella, formed, a, separate, spanish, inquisition, which, led, to, mass, expulsion, of, muslims, and, jews, from, the, peninsula, this, religious, court, system, was, later, adopted, and, transported, to, the, americas, though, they, took, a, less, effective, role, there, due, to, limited, jurisdiction, and, large, territories, with, the, christian, reconquest, completed, in, the, iberian, peninsula, spain, began, trying, to, take, territory, in, muslim, north, africa, it, had, conquered, melilla, in, 1497, and, further, expansionism, policy, in, north, africa, was, developed, during, the, regency, of, ferdinand, the, catholic, in, castile, stimulated, by, cardinal, cisneros, several, towns, and, outposts, in, the, north, african, coast, were, conquered, and, occupied, by, castile, mazalquivir, 1505, pe, n, de, v, lez, de, la, gomera, 1508, oran, 1509, tunis, bougie, and, tripoli, 1510, algiers, was, forced, to, pay, tribute, to, castile, until, ottoman, intervention, on, the, atlantic, coast, spain, took, possession, of, the, outpost, of, santa, cruz, de, la, mar, peque, a, 1476, with, support, from, the, canary, islands, and, it, was, retained, until, 1525, with, the, consent, of, the, treaty, of, cintra, 1509, the, ottoman, turks, expelled, the, spaniards, from, their, coastal, possessions, including, algiers, in, 1529, replacing, them, with, janissary, garrisons, to, extend, their, rule, into, the, central, maghrib, the, catholic, monarchs, had, developed, a, strategy, of, marriages, for, their, children, to, isolate, their, long, time, enemy, france, the, spanish, princesses, married, the, heirs, of, portugal, england, and, the, house, of, habsburg, following, the, same, strategy, the, catholic, monarchs, decided, to, support, the, aragonese, house, of, the, kingdom, of, naples, against, charles, viii, of, france, in, the, italian, wars, beginning, in, 1494, ferdinand, s, general, gonzalo, fern, ndez, de, c, rdoba, took, over, naples, after, defeating, the, french, at, the, battle, of, cerignola, and, the, battle, of, garigliano, in, 1503, in, these, battles, which, established, the, supremacy, of, the, spanish, tercios, in, european, battlefields, the, forces, of, the, kings, of, spain, acquired, a, reputation, for, invincibility, that, would, last, until, the, 1643, battle, of, rocroi, after, the, death, of, queen, isabella, in, 1504, and, her, exclusion, of, ferdinand, from, a, further, role, in, castile, ferdinand, married, germaine, de, foix, in, 1505, cementing, an, alliance, with, france, had, that, couple, had, a, surviving, heir, probably, the, crown, of, aragon, would, have, been, split, from, castile, which, was, inherited, by, charles, ferdinand, and, isabella, s, grandson, ferdinand, joined, the, league, of, cambrai, against, venice, in, 1508, in, 1511, he, became, part, of, the, holy, league, against, france, seeing, a, chance, at, taking, both, milan, to, which, he, held, a, dynastic, claim, and, navarre, in, 1516, france, agreed, to, a, truce, that, left, milan, in, its, control, and, recognized, spanish, control, of, upper, navarre, which, had, effectively, been, a, spanish, protectorate, following, a, series, of, treaties, in, 1488, 1491, 1493, and, 1495, following, the, italian, wars, against, france, which, concluded, in, 1559, spain, emerged, with, control, over, half, of, italy, kingdom, of, naples, sicily, sardinia, and, the, duchy, of, milan, with, the, treaty, of, cateau, cambr, sis, portugal, obtained, several, papal, bulls, that, acknowledged, portuguese, control, over, the, discovered, territories, but, castile, also, obtained, from, the, pope, the, safeguard, of, its, rights, to, the, canary, islands, with, the, bulls, romani, pontifex, dated, 6, november, 1436, and, dominatur, dominus, dated, 30, april, 1437, the, conquest, of, the, canary, islands, inhabited, by, guanche, people, began, in, 1402, during, the, reign, of, henry, iii, of, castile, by, norman, nobleman, jean, de, b, thencourt, under, a, feudal, agreement, with, the, crown, the, conquest, was, completed, with, the, campaigns, of, the, armies, of, the, crown, of, castile, between, 1478, and, 1496, when, the, islands, of, gran, canaria, 1478, 1483, la, palma, 1492, 1493, and, tenerife, 1494, 1496, were, subjugated, by, 1504, more, than, 90, percent, of, the, indigenous, canarians, had, been, killed, or, enslaved, the, portuguese, tried, in, vain, to, keep, secret, their, discovery, of, the, gold, coast, 1471, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, but, the, news, quickly, caused, a, huge, gold, rush, chronicler, pulgar, wrote, that, the, fame, of, the, treasures, of, guinea, spread, around, the, ports, of, andalusia, in, such, way, that, everybody, tried, to, go, there, worthless, trinkets, moorish, textiles, and, above, all, shells, from, the, canary, and, cape, verde, islands, were, exchanged, for, gold, slaves, ivory, and, guinea, pepper, the, war, of, the, castilian, succession, 1475, 79, provided, the, catholic, monarchs, with, the, opportunity, not, only, to, attack, the, main, source, of, the, portuguese, power, but, also, to, take, possession, of, this, lucrative, commerce, the, crown, officially, organized, this, trade, with, guinea, every, caravel, had, to, secure, a, government, license, and, to, pay, a, tax, on, one, fifth, of, their, profits, a, receiver, of, the, customs, of, guinea, was, established, in, seville, in, 1475, the, ancestor, of, the, future, and, famous, casa, de, contrataci, n, castilian, fleets, fought, in, the, atlantic, ocean, temporarily, occupying, the, cape, verde, islands, 1476, conquering, the, city, of, ceuta, in, the, tingitan, peninsula, in, 1476, but, retaken, by, the, portuguese, and, even, attacked, the, azores, islands, being, defeated, at, praia, the, turning, point, of, the, war, came, in, 1478, however, when, a, castilian, fleet, sent, by, king, ferdinand, to, conquer, gran, canaria, lost, men, and, ships, to, the, portuguese, who, expelled, the, attack, and, a, large, castilian, armada, full, of, gold, was, entirely, captured, in, the, decisive, battle, of, guinea, the, treaty, of, alc, ovas, 4, september, 1479, while, assuring, the, castilian, throne, to, the, catholic, monarchs, reflected, the, castilian, naval, and, colonial, defeat, war, with, castile, broke, out, waged, savagely, in, the, gulf, until, the, castilian, fleet, of, thirty, five, sail, was, defeated, there, in, 1478, as, a, result, of, this, naval, victory, at, the, treaty, of, alc, ovas, in, 1479, castile, while, retaining, her, rights, in, the, canaries, recognized, the, portuguese, monopoly, of, fishing, and, navigation, along, the, whole, west, african, coast, and, portugal, s, rights, over, the, madeira, azores, and, cape, verde, islands, the, treaty, delimited, the, spheres, of, influence, of, the, two, countries, establishing, the, principle, of, the, mare, clausum, it, was, confirmed, in, 1481, by, the, pope, sixtus, iv, in, the, papal, bull, terni, regis, dated, on, 21, june, 1481, however, this, experience, would, prove, to, be, profitable, for, future, spanish, overseas, expansion, because, as, the, spaniards, were, excluded, from, the, lands, discovered, or, to, be, discovered, from, the, canaries, southward, and, consequently, from, the, road, to, india, around, africa, they, sponsored, the, voyage, of, columbus, towards, the, west, 1492, in, search, of, asia, to, trade, in, its, spices, encountering, the, americas, instead, thus, the, limitations, imposed, by, the, alc, ovas, treaty, were, overcome, and, a, new, and, more, balanced, division, of, the, world, would, be, reached, in, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, between, both, emerging, maritime, powers, seven, months, before, the, treaty, of, alca, ovas, king, john, ii, of, aragon, died, and, his, son, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, married, to, isabella, i, of, castile, inherited, the, thrones, of, the, crown, of, aragon, the, two, became, known, as, the, catholic, monarchs, with, their, marriage, a, personal, union, that, created, a, relationship, between, the, crown, of, aragon, and, castile, each, with, their, own, administrations, but, ruled, jointly, by, the, two, monarchs, ferdinand, and, isabella, defeated, the, last, muslim, king, out, of, granada, in, 1492, after, a, ten, year, war, the, catholic, monarchs, then, negotiated, with, christopher, columbus, a, genoese, sailor, attempting, to, reach, cipangu, japan, by, sailing, west, castile, was, already, engaged, in, a, race, of, exploration, with, portugal, to, reach, the, far, east, by, sea, when, columbus, made, his, bold, proposal, to, isabella, in, the, capitulations, of, santa, fe, dated, on, 17, april, 1492, christopher, columbus, obtained, from, the, catholic, monarchs, his, appointment, as, viceroy, and, governor, in, the, lands, already, discovered, and, that, he, might, discover, thenceforth, thereby, it, was, the, first, document, to, establish, an, administrative, organization, in, the, indies, columbus, discoveries, began, the, spanish, colonization, of, the, americas, spain, s, claim, to, these, lands, was, solidified, by, the, inter, caetera, papal, bull, dated, 4, may, 1493, and, dudum, siquidem, on, 26, september, 1493, since, the, portuguese, wanted, to, keep, the, line, of, demarcation, of, alca, ovas, running, east, and, west, along, a, latitude, south, of, cape, bojador, a, compromise, was, worked, out, and, incorporated, in, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, dated, on, 7, june, 1494, in, which, the, world, was, split, into, two, dividing, spanish, and, portuguese, claims, these, actions, gave, spain, exclusive, rights, to, establish, colonies, in, all, of, the, new, world, from, north, to, south, later, with, the, exception, of, brazil, which, portuguese, commander, pedro, lvares, cabral, encountered, in, 1500, as, well, as, the, easternmost, parts, of, asia, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, was, confirmed, by, pope, julius, ii, in, the, bull, ea, quae, pro, bono, pacis, on, 24, january, 1506, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, and, the, treaty, of, cintra, 18, september, 1509, established, the, limits, of, the, kingdom, of, fez, for, portugal, and, the, castilian, expansion, was, allowed, outside, these, limits, beginning, with, the, conquest, of, melilla, in, 1497, with, the, capitulations, of, santa, fe, the, crown, of, castile, granted, expansive, power, to, christopher, columbus, including, exploration, settlement, political, power, and, revenues, with, sovereignty, reserved, to, the, crown, the, first, voyage, established, sovereignty, for, the, crown, and, the, crown, acted, on, the, assumption, that, columbus, s, grandiose, assessment, of, what, he, found, was, true, so, spain, negotiated, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, with, portugal, to, protect, their, territory, on, the, spanish, side, of, the, line, the, crown, fairly, quickly, reassessed, its, relationship, with, columbus, and, moved, to, assert, more, direct, crown, control, over, the, territory, and, extinguish, his, privileges, with, that, lesson, learned, the, crown, was, far, more, prudent, in, the, specifying, the, terms, of, exploration, conquest, and, settlement, in, new, areas, the, pattern, in, the, caribbean, that, played, out, over, the, larger, spanish, indies, was, exploration, of, an, unknown, area, and, claim, of, sovereignty, for, the, crown, conquest, of, indigenous, peoples, or, assumption, of, control, without, direct, violence, settlement, by, spaniards, who, were, awarded, the, labour, of, indigenous, people, via, the, encomienda, and, the, existing, settlements, becoming, the, launch, point, for, further, exploration, conquest, and, settlement, followed, by, the, establishment, institutions, with, officials, appointed, by, the, crown, the, patterns, set, in, the, caribbean, were, replicated, throughout, the, expanding, spanish, sphere, so, although, the, importance, of, the, caribbean, quickly, faded, after, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, and, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, inca, empire, many, of, those, participating, in, those, conquests, had, started, their, exploits, in, the, caribbean, the, first, permanent, european, settlements, in, the, new, world, were, established, in, the, caribbean, initially, on, the, island, of, hispaniola, later, cuba, jamaica, and, puerto, rico, columbus, established, the, fort, of, la, navidad, in, present, day, haiti, it, was, later, destroyed, by, the, ta, nos, and, the, spanish, garrison, was, wiped, out, the, colonists, many, of, whom, were, criminals, banished, from, spain, quickly, grew, disillusioned, due, to, the, hardships, disease, and, poverty, they, experienced, frictions, arose, both, among, themselves, and, with, the, local, tribesmen, as, a, genoese, with, connections, to, portugal, columbus, considered, settlement, to, be, on, the, pattern, of, trading, forts, and, factories, with, salaried, employees, to, trade, with, locals, and, to, identify, exploitable, resources, however, spanish, settlement, in, the, new, world, was, based, on, a, pattern, of, a, large, permanent, settlements, with, the, entire, complex, of, institutions, and, material, life, to, replicate, castilian, life, in, a, different, venue, columbus, s, second, voyage, in, 1493, had, a, large, contingent, of, settlers, and, goods, to, accomplish, that, on, hispaniola, the, city, of, santo, domingo, was, founded, in, 1496, by, christopher, columbus, s, brother, bartholomew, columbus, and, became, a, stone, built, permanent, city, non, castilians, such, as, catalans, and, aragonese, were, often, prohibited, from, migrating, to, the, new, world, following, the, settlement, of, hispaniola, europeans, began, searching, elsewhere, to, begin, new, settlements, since, there, was, little, apparent, wealth, and, the, numbers, of, indigenous, were, declining, those, from, the, less, prosperous, hispaniola, were, eager, to, search, for, new, success, in, a, new, settlement, from, there, juan, ponce, de, le, n, conquered, puerto, rico, 1508, and, diego, vel, zquez, took, cuba, columbus, encountered, the, mainland, in, 1498, and, the, catholic, monarchs, learned, of, his, discovery, in, may, 1499, the, first, settlement, on, the, mainland, was, santa, mar, a, la, antigua, del, dari, n, in, castilla, de, oro, now, nicaragua, costa, rica, panama, and, colombia, settled, by, vasco, n, ez, de, balboa, in, 1510, in, 1513, balboa, crossed, the,

swamp, the, party, reached, apalachee, bay, with, 242, men, they, believed, they, were, near, other, spaniards, in, mexico, but, there, was, in, fact, 1500, miles, of, coast, between, them, they, followed, the, coast, westward, until, they, reached, the, mouth, of, the, mississippi, river, near, to, galveston, island, later, they, were, enslaved, for, a, few, years, by, various, native,

for, the, fabled, cities, of, gold, but, after, learning, from, natives, in, new, mexico, of, a, large, river, to, the, west, he, sent, garc, a, l, pez, de, c, rdenas, to, lead, a, small, contingent, to, find, it, with, the, guidance, of, hopi, indians, c, rdenas, and, his, men, became, the, first, outsiders, to, see, the, grand, canyon, however, c, rdenas, was, reportedly, unimpressed, with, the, canyon, assuming, the, width, of, the, colorado, river, at, six, feet, 1, 8, m, and, estimating, 300, foot, 91, m, tall, rock, formations, to, be, the, size, of, a, man, after, unsuccessfully, attempting, to, descend, to, the, river, they, left, the, area, defeated, by, the, difficult, terrain, and, torrid, weather, in, 1540, hernando, de, alarc, n, and, his, fleet, reached, the, mouth, of, the, colorado, river, intending, to, provide, additional, supplies, to, coronado, s, expedition, alarc, n, may, have, sailed, the, colorado, as, far, upstream, as, the, present, day, california, arizona, border, however, coronado, never, reached, the, gulf, of, california, and, alarc, n, eventually, gave, up, and, left, melchior, d, az, reached, the, delta, in, the, same, year, intending, to, establish, contact, with, alarc, n, but, the, latter, was, already, gone, by, the, time, of, d, az, s, arrival, d, az, named, the, colorado, river, rio, del, tizon, while, the, name, colorado, red,

the, natural, crossing, of, the, colorado, river, from, mexico, to, california, by, land, as, an, ideal, spot, for, a, city, as, the, colorado, river, narrows, to, slightly, under, 1000, feet, wide, in, one, small, point, later, military, expedition, that, crossed, the, colorado, river, at, the, yuma, crossing, include, juan, bautista, de, anza, 1774, in, 1541, hernando, de, soto, became, the, first, explorer, to, cross, the, mississippi, river, during, this, expedition, the, spanish, fought, utina, tribesmen, in, florida, chickasaws, in, mississippi, the, coosa, chiefdom, in, present, day, georgia, and, chief, tuskaloosa, at, the, battle, of, mabila, in, present, day, alabama, spanish, losses, at, mabila, were, 22, killed, and, 148, wounded, while, 2, 500, native, americans, were, killed, making, it, the, bloodiest, battle, ever, fought, between, native, american, tribes, and, europeans, in, the, present, day, united, states, in, 1565, the, spanish, led, by, pedro, men, ndez, de, avil, s, established, st, augustine, in, florida, subsequently, they, launched, an, attack, on, fort, caroline, in, french, florida, resulting, in, the, massacre, of, 142, french, huguenots, the, surviving, french, colonists, fled, on, ships, which, wrecked, in, a, storm, at, the, matanzas, river, the, spanish, captured, them, killing, 210, huguenots, in, the, massacre, at, matanzas, inlet, st, augustine, quickly, became, a, strategic, defensive, base, for, the, spanish, ships, full, of, gold, and, silver, being, sent, to, spain, from, its, new, world, dominions, the, chamuscado, and, rodr, guez, expedition, explored, new, mexico, in, 1581, 82, they, explored, a, part, of, the, route, visited, by, coronado, in, new, mexico, and, other, parts, in, the, southwestern, united, states, between, 1540, and, 1542, the, viceroy, of, new, spain, don, diego, garc, a, sarmiento, sent, another, expedition, in, 1648, to, explore, conquer, and, colonize, the, californias, as, a, result, of, the, marriage, politics, of, the, catholic, monarchs, in, spanish, reyes, cat, licos, their, habsburg, grandson, charles, inherited, the, castilian, empire, in, the, americas, and, the, possessions, of, the, crown, of, aragon, in, the, mediterranean, including, all, of, south, italy, lands, in, germany, the, low, countries, franche, comt, and, austria, starting, the, rule, of, the, spanish, habsburgs, the, austrian, hereditary, habsburg, domains, were, transferred, to, ferdinand, the, emperor, s, brother, whereas, spain, and, the, remaining, possessions, were, inherited, by, charles, s, son, philip, ii, of, spain, at, the, abdication, of, the, former, in, 1556, the, habsburgs, pursued, several, goals, i, learnt, a, proverb, here, said, a, french, traveler, in, 1603, everything, is, dear, in, spain, except, silver, the, problems, caused, by, inflation, were, discussed, by, scholars, at, the, school, of, salamanca, and, the, arbitristas, the, natural, resource, abundance, provoked, a, decline, in, entrepreneurship, as, profits, from, resource, extraction, are, less, risky, the, wealthy, preferred, to, invest, their, fortunes, in, public, debt, juros, the, habsburg, dynasty, spent, the, castilian, and, american, riches, in, wars, across, europe, on, behalf, of, habsburg, interests, and, declared, moratoriums, bankruptcies, on, their, debt, payments, several, times, these, burdens, led, to, a, number, of, revolts, across, the, spanish, habsburg, s, domains, including, their, spanish, kingdoms, philip, ii, of, spain, r, 1556, 98, conquered, the, philippines, in, 1565, making, him, ruler, of, the, first, true, globe, spanning, empire, his, victory, in, the, war, of, the, portuguese, succession, led, to, the, annexation, of, portugal, in, 1580, effectively, integrating, its, overseas, empire, encompassing, coastal, brazil, and, african, and, indian, coastal, enclaves, into, spain, s, domain, his, reign, was, marked, by, additional, conflicts, including, the, eighty, years, war, and, the, anglo, spanish, war, the, attempted, invasion, of, england, by, the, spanish, armada, in, 1588, marked, the, first, southern, european, threat, to, the, british, isles, since, roman, times, philip, also, became, embroiled, in, conflicts, with, the, ottoman, empire, and, in, 1571, his, galley, fleet, achieved, a, significant, victory, at, the, battle, of, lepanto, but, the, ottomans, quickly, rebuilt, their, mediterranean, fleet, and, forced, a, truce, on, philip, in, 1578, by, the, mid, 17th, century, spain, s, global, empire, burdened, its, economic, administrative, and, military, resources, over, the, preceding, century, spanish, troops, had, fought, in, france, germany, and, the, netherlands, suffering, heavy, casualties, despite, its, vast, holdings, spain, s, military, lacked, essential, modernization, and, heavily, relied, on, foreign, suppliers, nevertheless, spain, possessed, abundant, bullion, from, the, americas, which, played, a, crucial, role, in, both, sustaining, its, military, endeavors, and, meeting, the, needs, of, its, civilian, population, during, this, period, spain, displayed, limited, military, interest, in, its, overseas, colonies, the, criollo, elites, and, mestizo, and, mulatto, militia, provided, only, minimal, protection, often, assisted, by, more, influential, allies, with, vested, interests, in, maintaining, the, balance, of, power, and, safeguarding, the, spanish, empire, from, falling, into, enemy, hands, the, spanish, empire, benefited, from, favorable, factor, endowments, from, its, overseas, possessions, with, their, large, exploitable, indigenous, populations, and, rich, mining, areas, thus, the, crown, attempted, to, create, and, maintain, a, classic, closed, mercantile, system, warding, off, competitors, and, keeping, wealth, within, the, empire, specifically, within, the, crown, of, castile, while, in, theory, the, habsburgs, were, committed, to, maintaining, a, state, monopoly, the, reality, was, that, the, empire, was, a, porous, economic, realm, with, widespread, smuggling, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, under, the, habsburgs, spain, s, economic, conditions, gradually, declined, especially, in, regards, to, the, industrial, development, of, its, french, dutch, and, english, rivals, many, of, the, goods, being, exported, to, the, empire, originated, from, manufacturers, in, northwest, europe, rather, than, in, spain, illicit, commercial, activities, became, a, part, of, the, empire, s, administrative, structure, supported, by, large, flows, of, silver, from, the, americas, trade, prohibited, by, spanish, mercantilist, restrictions, flourished, as, it, provided, a, source, of, income, to, both, crown, officials, and, private, merchants, the, local, administrative, structure, in, buenos, aires, for, example, was, established, through, its, oversight, of, both, legal, and, illegal, commerce, the, crown, s, pursuit, of, wars, to, maintain, and, expand, territory, defend, the, catholic, faith, stamp, out, protestantism, and, beat, back, the, ottoman, turkish, strength, outstripped, its, ability, to, pay, for, it, all, despite, the, huge, production, of, silver, in, peru, and, new, spain, most, of, that, flow, paid, mercenary, soldiers, in, the, european, religious, wars, of, the, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, centuries, and, paid, foreign, merchants, for, the, consumer, goods, manufactured, in, northern, europe, paradoxically, the, wealth, of, the, indies, impoverished, spain, and, enriched, northern, europe, a, course, the, bourbon, monarchs, would, later, attempt, to, reverse, in, the, eighteenth, century, this, was, well, acknowledged, in, spain, with, writers, on, political, economy, the, arbitristas, sending, the, crown, lengthy, analyses, in, the, form, of, memorials, of, the, perceived, problems, and, with, proposed, solutions, according, to, these, thinkers, royal, expenditure, must, be, regulated, the, sale, of, office, halted, the, growth, of, the, church, checked, the, tax, system, must, be, overhauled, special, concessions, be, made, to, agricultural, laborers, rivers, be, made, navigable, and, dry, lands, irrigated, in, this, way, alone, could, castile, s, productivity, increase, its, commerce, restored, and, its, humiliating, dependence, on, foreigners, on, the, dutch, and, the, genoese, be, brought, to, an, end, since, the, early, days, of, the, caribbean, and, conquest, era, the, crown, attempted, to, control, trade, between, spain, and, the, indies, with, restrictive, policies, enforced, by, the, house, of, trade, est, 1503, in, seville, shipping, was, through, particular, ports, in, castile, seville, and, subsequently, c, diz, spanish, america, veracruz, acapulco, havana, cartagena, de, indias, and, callao, lima, and, the, philippines, manila, there, were, very, few, spanish, settlers, in, the, indies, in, the, very, early, period, and, spain, could, supply, sufficient, goods, to, them, but, as, the, aztec, and, inca, empires, were, conquered, in, the, early, sixteenth, century, and, large, deposits, of, silver, found, in, both, mexico, and, peru, spanish, immigration, increased, and, the, demand, for, goods, rose, far, beyond, spain, s, ability, to, supply, it, since, spain, had, little, capital, to, invest, in, the, expanding, trade, and, no, significant, commercial, group, bankers, and, commercial, houses, in, genoa, germany, the, netherlands, france, and, england, supplied, both, investment, capital, and, goods, in, a, supposedly, closed, system, even, in, the, sixteenth, century, spain, recognized, that, the, idealized, closed, system, did, not, function, in, reality, since, the, crown, did, not, alter, its, restrictive, structure, or, advocate, fiscal, prudence, despite, the, pleas, of, the, arbitristas, the, indies, trade, remained, nominally, in, the, hands, of, spain, but, in, fact, enriched, the, other, european, countries, the, crown, established, the, system, of, treasure, fleets, spanish, flota, to, protect, the, conveyance, of, silver, to, seville, later, c, diz, produced, in, other, european, countries, sevillian, merchants, conveyed, consumer, goods, that, were, registered, and, taxed, by, the, house, of, trade, and, then, sent, to, the, indies, other, european, commercial, interests, came, to, dominate, supply, with, spanish, merchant, houses, and, their, guilds, consulados, in, both, spain, and, the, indies, acting, as, mere, middlemen, reaping, a, slice, of, the, profits, however, those, profits, did, not, promote, a, manufacturing, sector, in, spain, s, economic, development, and, its, economy, continued, to, be, based, in, agriculture, the, wealth, of, the, indies, led, to, prosperity, in, northern, europe, particularly, in, the, netherlands, and, england, which, were, both, protestant, as, spain, s, power, weakened, in, the, seventeenth, century, england, the, netherlands, and, the, french, took, advantage, overseas, by, seizing, islands, in, the, caribbean, which, became, bases, for, a, burgeoning, contraband, trade, in, spanish, america, crown, officials, who, were, supposed, to, suppress, contraband, trade, were, quite, often, in, cahoots, with, the, foreigners, since, it, was, a, source, of, personal, enrichment, in, spain, the, crown, itself, participated, in, collusion, with, foreign, merchant, houses, since, they, paid, fines, meant, to, establish, a, compensation, to, the, state, for, losses, through, fraud, it, became, a, calculated, risk, for, merchant, houses, doing, business, and, for, the, crown, it, gained, income, that, would, have, otherwise, been, lost, foreign, merchants, were, part, of, the, supposed, monopoly, system, of, trade, the, transfer, of, the, house, of, trade, from, seville, to, c, diz, meant, foreign, merchant, houses, had, even, easier, access, to, the, spanish, trade, the, spanish, imperial, economy, s, major, global, impact, was, silver, mining, the, mines, in, peru, and, mexico, were, in, the, hands, of, a, few, elite, mining, entrepreneurs, with, access, to, capital, and, a, stomach, for, the, risk, that, mining, entailed, they, operated, under, a, system, of, royal, licensing, since, the, crown, held, the, rights, to, subsoil, wealth, mining, entrepreneurs, assumed, all, the, risk, of, the, enterprise, while, the, crown, gained, a, 20, slice, of, the, profits, the, royal, fifth, quinto, real, further, adding, to, the, crown, s, revenues, in, mining, was, that, it, held, a, monopoly, on, the, mercury, supply, used, for, separating, pure, silver, from, silver, ore, in, the, patio, process, the, crown, kept, the, price, high, thereby, depressing, the, volume, of, silver, production, protecting, its, flow, from, mexico, and, peru, as, it, transited, to, ports, for, shipment, to, spain, resulted, early, on, in, a, convoy, system, the, flota, sailing, twice, a, year, its, success, can, be, judged, by, the, fact, that, the, silver, fleet, was, captured, only, once, in, 1628, by, dutch, privateer, piet, hein, that, loss, resulted, in, the, bankruptcy, of, the, spanish, crown, and, an, extended, period, of, economic, depression, in, spain, one, practice, the, spanish, used, to, gather, workers, for, the, mines, was, called, repartimiento, this, was, a, rotational, forced, labor, system, where, indigenous, pueblos, were, obligated, to, send, laborers, to, work, in, spanish, mines, and, plantations, for, a, set, number, of, days, out, of, the, year, repartimiento, was, not, implemented, to, replace, slave, labor, but, instead, existed, alongside, free, wage, labor, slavery, and, indentured, labor, it, was, however, a, way, for, the, spanish, to, procure, cheap, labor, thus, boosting, the, mining, driven, economy, the, men, who, worked, as, repartimiento, laborers, were, not, always, resistant, to, the, practice, some, were, drawn, to, the, labor, as, a, way, to, supplement, the, wages, they, earned, cultivating, fields, so, as, to, support, their, families, and, of, course, pay, tributes, at, first, a, spaniard, could, get, repartimiento, laborers, to, work, for, them, with, permission, from, a, crown, official, such, as, a, viceroy, only, on, the, basis, that, this, labor, was, absolutely, necessary, to, provide, the, country, with, important, resources, this, condition, became, laxer, as, the, years, went, on, and, various, enterprises, had, repartimiento, laborers, who, would, work, in, dangerous, conditions, for, long, hours, and, low, wages, during, the, bourbon, era, economic, reforms, sought, to, reverse, the, pattern, that, left, spain, impoverished, with, no, manufacturing, sector, and, its, colonies, need, for, manufactured, goods, supplied, by, other, nations, it, attempted, to, establish, a, closed, trading, system, but, it, was, hampered, by, the, terms, of, the, 1713, treaty, of, utrecht, the, treaty, ending, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, with, a, victory, for, the, bourbon, french, candidate, for, the, throne, had, a, provision, for, british, merchants, to, legally, sell, slaves, with, a, license, asiento, de, negros, slaves, to, spanish, america, the, provision, undermined, the, possibility, of, a, revamped, spanish, monopoly, system, the, merchants, also, used, the, opportunity, to, engage, in, contraband, trade, of, their, manufactured, goods, crown, policy, sought, to, make, legal, trade, more, appealing, than, contraband, by, instituting, free, commerce, comercio, libre, in, 1778, whereby, spanish, american, ports, could, trade, with, each, other, and, they, could, trade, with, any, port, in, spain, it, was, aimed, at, revamping, a, closed, spanish, system, and, outflanking, the, increasingly, powerful, british, silver, production, revived, in, the, eighteenth, century, with, production, far, surpassing, the, earlier, output, the, crown, reduced, the, taxes, on, mercury, meaning, that, a, greater, volume, of, pure, silver, could, be, refined, silver, mining, absorbed, most, of, the, available, capital, in, mexico, and, peru, and, the, crown, emphasized, the, production, of, precious, metals, which, were, sent, to, spain, there, was, some, economic, development, in, the, indies, to, supply, food, but, a, diversified, economy, did, not, emerge, the, economic, reforms, of, the, bourbon, era, both, shaped, and, were, themselves, impacted, by, geopolitical, developments, in, europe, the, bourbon, reforms, arose, out, of, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, in, turn, the, crown, s, attempt, to, tighten, its, control, over, its, colonial, markets, in, the, americas, led, to, further, conflict, with, other, european, powers, who, were, vying, for, access, to, them, after, a, sparking, a, series, of, skirmishes, throughout, the, 1700s, over, its, stricter, policies, spain, s, reformed, trade, system, led, to, war, with, britain, in, 1796, in, the, americas, meanwhile, economic, policies, enacted, under, the, bourbons, had, different, impacts, in, different, regions, on, one, hand, silver, production, in, new, spain, greatly, increased, and, led, to, economic, growth, but, much, of, the, profits, of, the, revitalized, mining, sector, went, to, mining, elites, and, state, officials, while, in, rural, areas, of, new, spain, conditions, for, rural, workers, deteriorated, contributing, to, social, unrest, that, would, impact, subsequent, revolts, in, 1525, king, charles, i, of, spain, ordered, an, expedition, led, by, friar, garc, a, jofre, de, loa, sa, to, go, to, asia, by, the, western, route, to, colonize, the, maluku, islands, known, as, spice, islands, now, part, of,

commissioned, by, the, viceroy, of, new, spain, luis, de, velasco, to, explore, the, maluku, islands, where, magellan, and, ruy, l, pez, de, villalobos, had, landed, in, 1521, and, 1543, respectively, the, expedition, was, ordered, by, king, philip, ii, of, spain, after, whom, the, philippines, had, earlier, been, named, by, villalobos, legazpi, established, settlements, in, the, east, indies, and, the, pacific, islands, in, 1565, he, was, the, first, governor, general, of, the, spanish, east, indies, after, obtaining, peace, with, various, indigenous, tribes, l, pez, de, legazpi, made, manila,

the, 1700, death, of, the, childless, charles, ii, of, spain, the, crown, of, spain, was, contested, in, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, under, the, treaties, of, utrecht, 11, april, 1713, ending, the, war, the, french, prince, of, the, house, of, bourbon, philippe, of, anjou, grandchild, of, louis, xiv, of, france, became, king, philip, v, of, spain, he, retained, the, spanish, overseas, empire, in, the, americas, and, the, philippines, the, settlement, gave, spoils, to, those, who, had, backed, a, habsburg, for, the, spanish, monarchy, ceding, european, territory, of, the, spanish, netherlands, naples, milan, and, sardinia, to, austria, sicily, and, parts, of, milan, to, the, duchy, of, savoy, and, gibraltar, and, menorca, to, the, kingdom, of, great, britain, the, treaty, also, granted, british, merchants, the, exclusive, right, to, sell, slaves, in, spanish, america, for, thirty, years, the, asiento, de, negros, as, well, as, licensed, voyages, to, ports, in, spanish, colonial, dominions, and, openings, spain, s, economic, and, demographic, recovery, had, begun, slowly, in, the, last, decades, of, the, habsburg, reign, as, was, evident, from, the, growth, of, its, trading, convoys, and, the, much, more, rapid, growth, of, illicit, trade, during, the, period, this, growth, was, slower, than, the, growth, of, illicit, trade, by, northern, rivals, in, the, empire, s, markets, however, this, recovery, was, not, then, translated, into, institutional, improvement, rather, the, proximate, solutions, to, permanent, problems, this, legacy, of, neglect, was, reflected, in, the, early, years, of, bourbon, rule, in, which, the, military, was, ill, advisedly, pitched, into, battle, in, the, war, of, the, quadruple, alliance, 1718, 20, spain, was, defeated, in, italy, by, an, alliance, of, britain, france, savoy, and, austria, following, the, war, the, new, bourbon, monarchy, took, a, much, more, cautious, approach, to, international, relations, relying, on, a, family, alliance, with, bourbon, france, and, continuing, to, follow, a, program, of, institutional, renewal, the, crown, program, to, enact, reforms, that, promoted, administrative, control, and, efficiency, in, the, metropole, to, the, detriment, of, interests, in, the, colonies, undermined, creole, elites, loyalty, to, the, crown, when, french, forces, of, napoleon, bonaparte, invaded, the, iberian, peninsula, in, 1808, napoleon, ousted, the, spanish, bourbon, monarchy, placing, his, brother, joseph, bonaparte, on, the, spanish, throne, there, was, a, crisis, of, legitimacy, of, crown, rule, in, spanish, america, leading, to, the, spanish, american, wars, of, independence, 1808, 1826, the, spanish, bourbons, broadest, intentions, were, to, reorganize, the, institutions, of, empire, to, better, administer, it, for, the, benefit, of, spain, and, the, crown, it, sought, to, increase, revenues, and, to, assert, greater, crown, control, including, over, the, catholic, church, centralization, of, power, beginning, with, the, nueva, planta, decrees, against, the, realms, of, the, crown, of, aragon, was, to, be, for, the, benefit, of, the, crown, and, the, metropole, and, for, the, defense, of, its, empire, against, foreign, incursions, from, the, viewpoint, of, spain, the, structures, of, colonial, rule, under, the, habsburgs, were, no, longer, functioning, to, the, benefit, of, spain, with, much, wealth, being, retained, in, spanish, america, and, going, to, other, european, powers, the, presence, of, other, european, powers, in, the, caribbean, with, the, english, in, barbados, 1627, st, kitts, 1623, 25, and, jamaica, 1655, the, dutch, in, cura, ao, and, the, french, in, saint, domingue, haiti, 1697, martinique, and, guadeloupe, had, broken, the, integrity, of, the, closed, spanish, mercantile, system, and, established, thriving, sugar, colonies, at, the, beginning, of, his, reign, the, first, spanish, bourbon, king, philip, v, reorganized, the, government, to, strengthen, the, executive, power, of, the, monarch, as, was, done, in, france, in, place, of, the, deliberative, polysynodial, system, of, councils, philip, s, government, set, up, a, ministry, of, the, navy, and, the, indies, 1714, and, established, commercial, companies, the, honduras, company, 1714, a, caracas, company, the, guipuzcoana, company, 1728, and, the, most, successful, ones, the, havana, company, 1740, and, the, barcelona, trading, company, 1755, in, 1717, 18, the, structures, for, governing, the, indies, the, consejo, de, indias, and, the, casa, de, contrataci, n, which, governed, investments, in, the, cumbersome, spanish, treasure, fleets, were, transferred, from, seville, to, c, diz, where, foreign, merchant, houses, had, easier, access, to, the, indies, trade, c, diz, became, the, one, port, for, all, indies, trading, see, flota, system, individual, sailings, at, regular, intervals, were, slow, to, displace, the, traditional, armed, convoys, but, by, the, 1760s, there, were, regular, ships, plying, the, atlantic, from, c, diz, to, havana, and, puerto, rico, and, at, longer, intervals, to, the, r, o, de, la, plata, where, an, additional, viceroyalty, was, created, in, 1776, the, contraband, trade, that, was, the, lifeblood, of, the, habsburg, empire, declined, in, proportion, to, registered, shipping, a, shipping, registry, having, been, established, in, 1735, two, upheavals, registered, unease, within, spanish, america, and, at, the, same, time, demonstrated, the, renewed, resiliency, of, the, reformed, system, the, tupac, amaru, uprising, in, peru, in, 1780, and, the, rebellion, of, the, comuneros, of, new, granada, both, in, part, reactions, to, tighter, more, efficient, control, the, 18th, century, was, a, century, of, prosperity, for, the, overseas, spanish, empire, as, trade, within, grew, steadily, particularly, in, the, second, half, of, the, century, under, the, bourbon, reforms, spain, s, victory, in, the, battle, of, cartagena, de, indias, against, a, british, expedition, in, the, caribbean, port, of, cartagena, de, indias, helped, spain, secure, its, dominance, of, its, possessions, in, the, americas, until, the, 19th, century, but, different, regions, fared, differently, under, bourbon, rule, and, even, while, new, spain, was, particularly, prosperous, it, was, also, marked, by, steep, wealth, inequality, silver, production, boomed, in, new, spain, during, the, 18th, century, with, output, more, than, tripling, between, the, start, of, the, century, and, the, 1750s, the, economy, and, the, population, both, grew, both, centered, around, mexico, city, but, while, mine, owners, and, the, crown, benefited, from, the, flourishing, silver, economy, most, of, the, population, in, the, rural, baj, o, faced, rising, land, prices, falling, wages, eviction, of, many, from, their, lands, resulted, with, a, bourbon, monarchy, came, a, repertory, of, bourbon, mercantilist, ideas, based, on, a, centralized, state, put, into, effect, in, the, americas, slowly, at, first, but, with, increasing, momentum, during, the, century, shipping, grew, rapidly, from, the, mid, 1740s, until, the, seven, years, war, 1756, 63, reflecting, in, part, the, success, of, the, bourbons, in, bringing, illicit, trade, under, control, with, the, loosening, of, trade, controls, after, the, seven, years, war, shipping, trade, within, the, empire, once, again, began, to, expand, reaching, an, extraordinary, rate, of, growth, in, the, 1780s, the, end, of, c, diz, s, monopoly, of, trade, with, the, american, colonies, brought, about, very, important, changes, particularly, a, rebirth, of, spanish, manufactures, most, notable, of, those, changes, were, both, the, beginning, of, catalan, participation, in, the, spanish, slave, trade, and, the, rapidly, growing, textile, industry, of, catalonia, which, by, the, mid, 1780s, saw, the, first, signs, of, industrialization, this, saw, the, emergence, of, a, small, politically, active, commercial, class, in, barcelona, this, isolated, pocket, of, advanced, economic, development, stood, in, stark, contrast, to, the, relative, backwardness, of, most, of, the, country, most, of, the, improvements, were, in, and, around, some, major, coastal, cities, and, the, major, islands, such, as, cuba, with, its, tobacco, plantations, and, a, renewed, growth, of, precious, metals, mining, in, south, america, agricultural, productivity, remained, low, despite, efforts, to, introduce, new, techniques, to, what, was, for, the, most, part, an, uninterested, exploited, peasant, and, laboring, groups, governments, were, inconsistent, in, their, policies, though, there, were, substantial, improvements, by, the, late, 18th, century, spain, was, still, an, economic, backwater, under, the, mercantile, trading, arrangements, it, had, difficulty, in, providing, the, goods, being, demanded, by, the, strongly, growing, markets, of, its, empire, and, providing, adequate, outlets, for, the, return, trade, from, an, opposing, point, of, view, according, to, the, backwardness, mentioned, above, the, naturalist, and, explorer, alexander, von, humboldt, traveled, extensively, throughout, the, spanish, americas, exploring, and, describing, it, for, the, first, time, from, a, modern, scientific, point, of, view, between, 1799, and, 1804, in, his, work, political, essay, on, the, kingdom, of, new, spain, containing, researches, relative, to, the, geography, of, mexico, he, says, that, the, amerindians, of, new, spain, were, wealthier, than, any, russian, or, german, peasant, in, europe, according, to, humboldt, despite, the, fact, that, indian, farmers, were, poor, under, spanish, rule, they, were, free, and, slavery, was, non, existent, their, conditions, were, much, better, than, any, other, peasant, or, farmer, in, northern, europe, humboldt, also, published, a, comparative, analysis, of, bread, and, meat, consumption, in, new, spain, compared, to, other, cities, in, europe, such, as, paris, mexico, city, consumed, 189, pounds, of, meat, per, person, per, year, in, comparison, to, 163, pounds, consumed, by, the, inhabitants, of, paris, the, mexicans, also, consumed, almost, the, same, amount, of, bread, as, any, european, city, with, 363, kilograms, of, bread, per, person, per, year, in, comparison, to, the, 377, kilograms, consumed, in, paris, caracas, consumed, seven, times, more, meat, per, person, than, in, paris, von, humboldt, also, said, that, the, average, income, in, that, period, was, four, times, the, european, income, and, also, that, the, cities, of, new, spain, were, richer, than, many, european, cities, the, spanish, american, enlightenment, produced, a, huge, body, of, information, on, spain, s, overseas, empire, via, scientific, expeditions, the, most, famous, traveler, in, spanish, america, was, prussian, scientist, alexander, von, humboldt, whose, travel, writings, especially, political, essay, on, the, kingdom, of, new, spain, and, scientific, observations, remain, important, sources, for, the, history, of, spanish, america, humboldt, s, expedition, was, authorized, by, the, crown, but, was, self, funded, from, his, personal, fortune, the, bourbon, crown, promoted, state, funded, scientific, work, prior, to, the, famous, humboldt, expedition, eighteenth, century, clerics, contributed, to, the, expansion, of, scientific, knowledge, these, include, jos, antonio, de, alzate, y, ram, rez, and, jos, celestino, mutis, the, spanish, crown, funded, a, number, of, important, scientific, expeditions, botanical, expedition, to, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, 1777, 78, royal, botanical, expedition, to, new, granada, 1783, 1816, the, royal, botanical, expedition, to, new, spain, 1787, 1803, which, scholars, are, now, examining, afresh, although, the, crown, funded, a, number, of, spanish, expeditions, to, the, pacific, northwest, to, bolster, claims, to, territory, lengthy, transatlantic, and, transpacific, malaspina, bustamante, expedition, was, for, scientific, purposes, the, crown, also, funded, the, balmis, expedition, in, 1804, to, vaccinate, colonial, populations, against, smallpox, much, of, the, research, done, in, the, eighteenth, century, was, never, published, or, otherwise, disseminated, in, part, due, to, budgetary, constraints, on, the, crown, starting, in, the, late, twentieth, century, research, on, the, history, of, science, in, spain, and, the, spanish, empire, has, blossomed, with, primary, sources, being, published, in, scholarly, editions, or, reissued, as, well, the, publication, of, a, considerable, number, of, important, scholarly, studies, bourbon, institutional, reforms, under, philip, v, bore, fruit, militarily, when, spanish, forces, easily, retook, naples, and, sicily, from, the, austrians, at, the, battle, of, bitonto, in, 1734, during, the, war, of, the, polish, succession, and, during, the, war, of, jenkins, ear, 1739, 42, thwarted, british, efforts, to, capture, the, strategic, cities, of, cartagena, de, indias, santiago, de, cuba, and, st, augustine, by, defeating, a, british, combined, army, and, navy, force, although, spain, s, invasion, of, georgia, also, failed, the, british, suffered, 25, 000, dead, or, wounded, and, lost, nearly, 5, 000, ships, during, the, war, in, 1742, the, war, of, jenkins, ear, merged, with, the, larger, war, of, the, austrian, succession, and, king, george, s, war, in, north, america, the, british, also, occupied, with, france, were, unable, to, capture, spanish, convoys, and, spanish, privateers, captured, british, merchant, shipping, along, the, triangle,

northern, italy, since, 1741, but, faced, the, opposition, of, charles, emmanuel, iii, of, sardinia, and, warfare, in, northern, italy, remained, indecisive, throughout, the, period, up, to, 1746, by, the, 1748, treaty, of, aix, la, chappelle, spain, gained, indirectly, parma, piacenza, and, guastalla, in, northern, italy, spain, was, defeated, during, the, invasion, of, portugal, and, lost, both, havana, and, manila, to, british, forces, towards, the, end, of, the, seven, years, war, 1756, 63, but, it, promptly, recovered, these, losses, and, spanish, forces, seized, british, forts, in, west, florida, present, day, louisiana, mississippi, alabama, and, florida, and, the, british, naval, base, in, the, bahamas, during, the, american, revolutionary, war, 1775, 83, during, most, of, the, 18th, century, spanish, privateers, particularly, from, santo, domingo, were, the, scourge, of, the, antilles, with, dutch, british, french, and, danish, vessels, as, their, prizes, the, majority, of, the, territory, of, today, s, brazil, had, been, claimed, as, spanish, when, exploration, began, with, the, navigation, of, the, length, of, the, amazon, river, in, 1541, 42, by, francisco, de, orellana, many, spanish, expeditions, explored, large, parts, of, this, vast, region, especially, those, close, to, spanish, settlements, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, spanish, soldiers, missionaries, and, adventurers, also, established, pioneering, communities, primarily, in, paran, santa, catarina, and, s, o, paulo, and, forts, on, the, northeastern, coast, threatened, by, the, french, and, dutch, as, portuguese, brazilian, settlement, expanded, following, in, the, trail, of, the, bandeirantes, exploits, these, isolated, spanish, groups, were, eventually, integrated, into, brazilian, society, only, some, castilians, who, were, displaced, from, the, disputed, areas, of, the, pampas, of, rio, grande, do, sul, have, left, a, significant, influence, on, the, formation, of, the, gaucho, when, they, mixed, with, indian, groups, portuguese, and, blacks, who, arrived, in, the, region, during, the, 18th, century, the, spanish, were, barred, by, their, laws, from, slaving, of, indigenous, people, leaving, them, without, a, commercial, interest, deep, in, the, interior, of, the, amazon, basin, the, laws, of, burgos, 1512, and, the, new, laws, 1542, had, been, intended, to, protect, the, interests, of, indigenous, people, the, portuguese, brazilian, slavers, the, bandeirantes, had, the, advantage, of, access, from, the, mouth, of, the, amazon, river, which, was, on, the, portuguese, side, of, the, line, of, tordesillas, one, famous, attack, upon, a, spanish, mission, in, 1628, resulted, in, the, enslavement, of, about, 60, 000, indigenous, people, in, time, there, was, in, effect, a, self, funding, force, of, occupation, by, the, 18th, century, much, of, the, spanish, territory, was, under, de, facto, control, of, portuguese, brazil, this, reality, was, recognized, with, the, legal, transfer, of, sovereignty, in, 1750, of, most, of, the, amazon, basin, and, surrounding, areas, to, portugal, in, the, treaty, of, madrid, this, settlement, sowed, the, seeds, of, the, guaran, war, in, 1756, spain, claimed, all, of, north, america, in, the, age, of, discovery, but, claims, were, not, translated, into, occupation, until, a, major, resource, was, discovered, and, spanish, settlement, and, crown, rule, put, in, place, the, french, had, established, an, empire, in, northern, north, america, and, took, some, islands, in, the, caribbean, the, english, established, colonies, on, the, eastern, seaboard, of, north, america, and, in, northern, north, america, and, some, caribbean, islands, as, well, in, the, eighteenth, century, the, spanish, crown, realized, that, its, territorial, claims, needed, to, be, defended, particularly, in, the, wake, of, its, visible, weakness, during, the, seven, years, war, when, britain, captured, the, important, spanish, ports, of, havana, and, manila, another, important, factor, was, that, the, russian, empire, had, expanded, into, north, america, from, the, mid, eighteenth, century, with, fur, trading, settlements, in, what, is, now, alaska, and, forts, as, far, south, as, fort, ross, california, great, britain, was, also, expanding, into, areas, that, spain, claimed, as, its, territory, on, the, pacific, coast, taking, steps, to, shore, up, its, fragile, claims, to, california, spain, began, planning, california, missions, in, 1769, spain, also, began, a, series, of, voyages, to, the, pacific, northwest, where, russia, and, great, britain, were, encroaching, on, claimed, territory, the, spanish, expeditions, to, the, pacific, northwest, with, alessandro, malaspina, and, others, sailing, for, spain, came, too, late, for, spain, to, assert, its, sovereignty, in, the, pacific, northwest, the, nootka, crisis, 1789, 1791, nearly, brought, spain, and, britain, to, war, it, was, a, dispute, over, claims, in, the, pacific, northwest, where, neither, nation, had, established, permanent, settlements, the, crisis, could, have, led, to, war, but, without, french, support, spain, capitulated, to, british, terms, and, negotiations, took, place, with, the, nootka, convention, spain, and, great, britain, agreed, to, not, establish, settlements, and, allowed, free, access, to, nootka, sound, on, the, west, coast, of, what, is, now, vancouver, island, nevertheless, the, outcome, of, the, crisis, was, a, humiliation, for, spain, and, a, triumph, for, britain, as, spain, had, practically, renounced, all, sovereignty, on, the, north, pacific, coast, in, 1806, baron, nikolai, rezanov, attempted, to, negotiate, a, treaty, between, the, russian, american, company, and, the, viceroyalty, of, new, spain, but, his, unexpected, death, in, 1807, ended, any, treaty, hopes, spain, gave, up, its, claims, in, the, west, of, north, america, in, the, adams, onis, treaty, of, 1819, ceding, its, rights, there, to, the, united, states, allowing, the, u, s, to, purchase, florida, and, establishing, a, boundary, between, new, spain, and, the, u, s, when, the, negotiations,

political, cultural, and, urban, architectural, legacy, in, the, western, hemisphere, with, over, 470, million, native, speakers, today, spanish, is, the, second, most, spoken, native, language, in, the, world, as, result, of, the, introduction, of, the, language, of, castile, castilian, castellano, from, iberia, to, spanish, america, later, expanded, by, the, governments, of, successor, independent, republics, in, the, philippines, the, spanish, american, war, 1898, brought, the, islands, under, u, s, jurisdiction, with, english, being, imposed, in, schools, and, spanish, becoming, a, secondary, official, language, many, indigenous, languages, throughout, the, empire, were, often, lost, either, as, indigenous, populations, were, decimated, by, war, and, disease, or, as, indigenous, people, mixed, with, colonists, and, the, spanish, language, was, taught, and, spread, over, time, an, important, cultural, legacy, of, the, spanish, empire, overseas, is, roman, catholicism, which, remains, the, main, religious, faith, in, spanish, america, and, the, philippines, christian, evangelization, of, indigenous, peoples, was, a, key, responsibility, of, the, crown, and, a, justification, for, its, imperial, expansion, although, indigenous, were, considered, neophytes, and, insufficiently, mature, in, their, faith, for, indigenous, men, to, be, ordained, to, the, priesthood, the, indigenous, were, part, of, the, catholic, community, of, faith, catholic, orthodoxy, was, enforced, by, the, inquisition, particularly, targeting, crypto, jews, and, protestants, not, until, after, their, independence, in, the, nineteenth, century, did, spanish, american, republics, allow, religious, toleration, of, other, faiths, observances, of, catholic, holidays, often, have, strong, regional, expressions, and, remain, important, in, many, parts, of, spanish, america, observances, include, day, of, the, dead, carnival, holy, week, corpus, christi, epiphany, and, national, saints, days, such, as, the, virgin, of, guadalupe, in, mexico, politically, the, colonial, era, has, strongly, influenced, modern, spanish, america, the, territorial, divisions, of, the, empire, in, spanish, america, became, the, basis, for, boundaries, between, new, republics, after, independence, and, for, state, divisions, within, countries, it, is, often, argued, that, the, rise, of, caudillismo, during, and, after, latin, american, independence, movements, created, a, legacy, of, authoritarianism, in, the, region, there, was, no, significant, development, of, representative, institutions, during, the, colonial, era, and, the, executive, power, was, often, made, stronger, than, the, legislative, power, during, the, national, period, as, a, result, this, has, led, to, a, popular, misconception, that, the, colonial, legacy, has, caused, the, region, to, have, an, extremely, oppressed, proletariat, revolts, and, riots, are, often, seen, as, evidence, of, this, supposed, extreme, oppression, however, the, culture, of, revolting, against, an, unpopular, government, is, not, simply, a, confirmation, of, widespread, authoritarianism, the, colonial, legacy, did, leave, a, political, culture, of, revolt, but, not, always, as, a, desperate, last, act, the, civil, unrest, of, the, region, is, seen, by, some, as, a, form, of, political, involvement, while, the, political, context, of, the, political, revolutions, in, spanish, america, is, understood, to, be, one, in, which, liberal, elites, competed, to, form, new, national, political, structures, so, too, were, those, elites, responding, to, mass, lower, class, political, mobilization, and, participation, hundreds, of, towns, and, cities, in, the, americas, were, founded, during, the, spanish, rule, with, the, colonial, centers, and, buildings, of, many, of, them, now, designated, as, unesco, world, heritage, sites, attracting, tourists, the, tangible, heritage, includes, universities, forts, cities, cathedrals, schools, hospitals, missions, government, buildings, and, colonial, residences, many, of, which, still, stand, today, a, number, of, present, day, roads, canals, ports, or, bridges, sit, where, spanish, engineers, built, them, centuries, ago, the, oldest, universities, in, the, americas, were, founded, by, spanish, scholars, and, catholic, missionaries, the, spanish, empire, also, left, a, vast, cultural, and, linguistic, legacy, the, cultural, legacy, is, also, present, in, the, music, cuisine, and, fashion, some, of, which, have, been, granted, the, status, of, unesco, intangible, cultural, heritage, the, long, colonial, period, in, spanish, america, resulted, in, a, mixing, of, indigenous, peoples, europeans, and, africans, that, were, classified, by, race, and, hierarchically, ranked, which, created, a, markedly, different, society, than, the, european, colonies, of, north, america, in, concert, with, the, portuguese, the, spanish, empire, laid, the, foundations, of, a, truly, global, trade, by, opening, up, the, great, trans, oceanic, trade, routes, and, the, exploration, of, unknown, territories, and, oceans, for, the, western, knowledge, the, spanish, dollar, became, the, world, s, first, global, currency, one, of, the, features, of, this, trade, was, the, exchange, of, a, great, array, of, domesticated, plants, and, animals, between, the, old, world, and, the, new, in, the, columbian, exchange, some, cultivars, that, were, introduced, to, the, americas, included, grapes, wheat, barley, apples, and, citrous, fruits, animals, that, were, introduced, to, the, new, world, were, horses, donkeys, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and, chickens, the, old, world, received, from, the, americas, such, things, as, maize, potatoes, chili, peppers, tomatoes, tobacco, beans, squash, cacao, chocolate, vanilla, avocados, pineapples, chewing, gum, rubber, peanuts, cashews, brazil, nuts, pecans, blueberries, strawberries, quinoa, amaranth, chia, agave, and, others, the, result, of, these, exchanges, was, to, significantly, improve, the, agricultural, potential, of, not, only, in, the, americas, but, also, that, of, europe, and, asia, diseases, brought, by, europeans, and, africans, such, as, smallpox, measles, typhus, and, others, devastated, almost, all, indigenous, populations, that, had, no, immunity, there, were, also, cultural, influences, which, can, be, seen, in, everything, from, architecture, to, food, music, art, and, law, from, southern, argentina, and, chile, to, the, united, states, of, america, together, with, the, philippines, the, complex, origins, and, contacts, of, different, peoples, resulted, in, cultural, influences, coming, together, in, the, varied, forms, evident, today, in, the, former, colonial, areas
