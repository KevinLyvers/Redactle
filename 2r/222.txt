the, aztecs, z, t, k, s, az, teks, were, a, mesoamerican, civilization, that, flourished, in, central, mexico, in, the, post, classic, period, from, 1300, to, 1521, the, aztec, people, included, different, ethnic, groups, of, central, mexico, particularly, those, groups, who, spoke, the, nahuatl, language, and, who, dominated, large, parts, of, mesoamerica, from, the, 14th, to, the, 16th, centuries, aztec, culture, was, organized, into, city, states, altepetl, some, of, which, joined, to, form, alliances, political, confederations, or, empires, the, aztec, empire, was, a, confederation, of, three, city, states, established, in, 1427, tenochtitlan, the, capital, city, of, the, mexica, or, tenochca, tetzcoco, and, tlacopan, previously, part, of, the, tepanec, empire, whose, dominant, power, was, azcapotzalco, although, the, term, aztecs, is, often, narrowly, restricted, to, the, mexica, of, tenochtitlan, it, is, also, broadly, used, to, refer, to, nahua, polities, or, peoples, of, central, mexico, in, the, prehispanic, era, as, well, as, the, spanish, colonial, era, 1521, 1821, the, definitions, of, aztec, and, aztecs, have, long, been, the, topic, of, scholarly, discussion, ever, since, german, scientist, alexander, von, humboldt, established, its, common, usage, in, the, early, 19th, century, most, ethnic, groups, of, central, mexico, in, the, post, classic, period, shared, essential, cultural, traits, of, mesoamerica, so, many, of, the, characteristics, that, characterize, aztec, culture, cannot, be, said, to, be, exclusive, to, the, aztecs, for, the, same, reason, the, notion, of, aztec, civilization, is, best, understood, as, a, particular, horizon, of, a, general, mesoamerican, civilization, the, culture, of, central, mexico, includes, maize, cultivation, the, social, division, between, nobility, pipiltin, and, commoners, macehualtin, a, pantheon, featuring, tezcatlipoca, tlaloc, and, quetzalcoatl, and, the, calendric, system, of, a, xiuhpohualli, of, 365, days, intercalated, with, a, tonalpohualli, of, 260, days, particular, to, the, mexica, of, tenochtitlan, was, the, patron, god, huitzilopochtli, twin, pyramids, and, the, ceramic, styles, known, as, aztec, i, to, iv, from, the, 13th, century, the, valley, of, mexico, was, the, heart, of, dense, population, and, the, rise, of, city, states, the, mexica, were, late, comers, to, the, valley, of, mexico, and, founded, the, city, state, of, tenochtitlan, on, unpromising, islets, in, lake, texcoco, later, becoming, the, dominant, power, of, the, aztec, triple, alliance, or, aztec, empire, it, was, an, empire, that, expanded, its, political, hegemony, far, beyond, the, valley, of, mexico, conquering, other, city, states, throughout, mesoamerica, in, the, late, post, classic, period, it, originated, in, 1427, as, an, alliance, between, the, city, states, tenochtitlan, texcoco, and, tlacopan, these, allied, to, defeat, the, tepanec, state, of, azcapotzalco, which, had, previously, dominated, the, basin, of, mexico, soon, texcoco, and, tlacopan, were, relegated, to, junior, partnership, in, the, alliance, with, tenochtitlan, the, dominant, power, the, empire, extended, its, reach, by, a, combination, of, trade, and, military, conquest, it, was, never, a, true, territorial, empire, controlling, territory, by, large, military, garrisons, in, conquered, provinces, but, rather, dominated, its, client, city, states, primarily, by, installing, friendly, rulers, in, conquered, territories, constructing, marriage, alliances, between, the, ruling, dynasties, and, extending, an, imperial, ideology, to, its, client, city, states, client, city, states, paid, taxes, not, tribute, to, the, aztec, emperor, the, huey, tlatoani, in, an, economic, strategy, limiting, communication, and, trade, between, outlying, polities, making, them, dependent, on, the, imperial, center, for, the, acquisition, of, luxury, goods, the, political, clout, of, the, empire, reached, far, south, into, mesoamerica, conquering, polities, as, far, south, as, chiapas, and, guatemala, and, spanning, mesoamerica, from, the, pacific, to, the, atlantic, oceans, the, empire, reached, its, maximum, extent, in, 1519, just, before, the, arrival, of, a, small, group, of, spanish, conquistadors, led, by, hern, n, cort, s, cort, s, allied, with, city, states, opposed, to, the, mexica, particularly, the, nahuatl, speaking, tlaxcalteca, as, well, as, other, central, mexican, polities, including, texcoco, its, former, ally, in, the, triple, alliance, after, the, fall, of, tenochtitlan, on, 13, august, 1521, and, the, capture, of, the, emperor, cuauht, moc, the, spanish, founded, mexico, city, on, the, ruins, of, tenochtitlan, from, there, they, proceeded, with, the, process, of, conquest, and, incorporation, of, mesoamerican, peoples, into, the, spanish, empire, with, the, destruction, of, the, superstructure, of, the, aztec, empire, in, 1521, the, spanish, used, the, city, states, on, which, the, aztec, empire, had, been, built, to, rule, the, indigenous, populations, via, their, local, nobles, those, nobles, pledged, loyalty, to, the, spanish, crown, and, converted, at, least, nominally, to, christianity, and, in, return, were, recognized, as, nobles, by, the, spanish, crown, nobles, acted, as, intermediaries, to, convey, taxes, and, mobilize, labor, for, their, new, overlords, facilitating, the, establishment, of, spanish, colonial, rule, aztec, culture, and, history, are, primarily, known, through, archaeological, evidence, found, in, excavations, such, as, that, of, the, renowned, templo, mayor, in, mexico, city, from, indigenous, writings, from, eyewitness, accounts, by, spanish, conquistadors, such, as, cort, s, and, bernal, d, az, del, castillo, and, especially, from, 16th, and, 17th, century, descriptions, of, aztec, culture, and, history, written, by, spanish, clergymen, and, literate, aztecs, in, the, spanish, or, nahuatl, language, such, as, the, famous, illustrated, bilingual, spanish, and, nahuatl, twelve, volume, florentine, codex, created, by, the, franciscan, friar, bernardino, de, sahag, n, in, collaboration, with, indigenous, aztec, informants, important, for, knowledge, of, post, conquest, nahuas, was, the, training, of, indigenous, scribes, to, write, alphabetic, texts, in, nahuatl, mainly, for, local, purposes, under, spanish, colonial, rule, at, its, height, aztec, culture, had, rich, and, complex, philosophical, mythological, and, religious, traditions, as, well, as, remarkable, architectural, and, artistic, accomplishments, the, nahuatl, words, azt, catl, nahuatl, pronunciation, singular, and, azt, cah, nahuatl, pronunciation, plural, mean, people, from, aztl, n, a, mythical, place, of, origin, for, several, ethnic, groups, in, central, mexico, the, term, was, not, used, as, an, endonym, by, the, aztecs, themselves, but, it, is, found, in, the, different, migration, accounts, of, the, mexica, where, it, describes, the, different, tribes, who, left, aztlan, together, in, one, account, of, the, journey, from, aztlan, huitzilopochtli, the, tutelary, deity, of, the, mexica, tribe, tells, his, followers, on, the, journey, that, now, no, longer, is, your, name, azteca, you, are, now, mexitin, in, today, s, usage, the, term, aztec, often, refers, exclusively, to, the, mexica, people, of, tenochtitlan, now, the, location, of, mexico, city, situated, on, an, island, in, lake, texcoco, who, referred, to, themselves, as, m, xihcah, nahuatl, pronunciation, a, tribal, designation, that, included, the, tlatelolco, tenochcah, nahuatl, pronunciation, referring, only, to, the, mexica, of, tenochtitlan, excluding, tlatelolco, or, c, lhuah, nahuatl, pronunciation, referring, to, their, royal, genealogy, tying, them, to, culhuacan, sometimes, the, term, also, includes, the, inhabitants, of, tenochtitlan, s, two, principal, allied, city, states, the, acolhuas, of, texcoco, and, the, tepanecs, of, tlacopan, who, together, with, the, mexica, formed, the, aztec, triple, alliance, that, controlled, what, is, often, known, as, the, aztec, empire, the, usage, of, the, term, aztec, in, describing, the, empire, centered, in, tenochtitlan, has, been, criticized, by, robert, h, barlow, who, preferred, the, term, culhua, mexica, and, by, pedro, carrasco, who, prefers, the, term, tenochca, empire, carrasco, writes, about, the, term, aztec, that, it, is, of, no, use, for, understanding, the, ethnic, complexity, of, ancient, mexico, and, for, identifying, the, dominant, element, in, the, political, entity, we, are, studying, in, other, contexts, aztec, may, refer, to, all, the, various, city, states, and, their, peoples, who, shared, large, parts, of, their, ethnic, history, and, cultural, traits, with, the, mexica, acolhua, and, tepanecs, and, who, often, also, used, the, nahuatl, language, as, a, lingua, franca, an, example, is, jerome, a, offner, s, law, and, politics, in, aztec, texcoco, in, this, meaning, it, is, possible, to, talk, about, an, aztec, civilization, including, all, the, particular, cultural, patterns, common, for, most, of, the, peoples, inhabiting, central, mexico, in, the, late, postclassic, period, such, usage, may, also, extend, the, term, aztec, to, all, the, groups, in, central, mexico, that, were, incorporated, culturally, or, politically, into, the, sphere, of, dominance, of, the, aztec, empire, when, used, to, describe, ethnic, groups, the, term, aztec, refers, to, several, nahuatl, speaking, peoples, of, central, mexico, in, the, postclassic, period, of, mesoamerican, chronology, especially, the, mexica, the, ethnic, group, that, had, a, leading, role, in, establishing, the, hegemonic, empire, based, at, tenochtitlan, the, term, extends, to, further, ethnic, groups, associated, with, the, aztec, empire, such, as, the, acolhua, the, tepanec, and, others, that, were, incorporated, into, the, empire, charles, gibson, enumerates, many, groups, in, central, mexico, that, he, includes, in, his, study, the, aztecs, under, spanish, rule, 1964, these, include, the, culhuaque, cuitlahuaque, mixquica, xochimilca, chalca, tepaneca, acolhuaque, and, mexica, in, older, usage, the, term, was, commonly, used, about, modern, nahuatl, speaking, ethnic, groups, as, nahuatl, was, previously, referred, to, as, the, aztec, language, in, recent, usage, these, ethnic, groups, are, referred, to, as, the, nahua, peoples, linguistically, the, term, aztecan, is, still, used, about, the, branch, of, the, uto, aztecan, languages, also, sometimes, called, the, uto, nahuan, languages, that, includes, the, nahuatl, language, and, its, closest, relatives, pochutec, and, pipil, to, the, aztecs, themselves, the, word, aztec, was, not, an, endonym, for, any, particular, ethnic, group, rather, it, was, an, umbrella, term, used, to, refer, to, several, ethnic, groups, not, all, of, them, nahuatl, speaking, that, claimed, heritage, from, the, mythic, place, of, origin, aztlan, alexander, von, humboldt, originated, the, modern, usage, of, aztec, in, 1810, as, a, collective, term, applied, to, all, the, people, linked, by, trade, custom, religion, and, language, to, the, mexica, state, and, the, triple, alliance, in, 1843, with, the, publication, of, the, work, of, william, h, prescott, on, the, history, of, the, conquest, of, mexico, the, term, was, adopted, by, most, of, the, world, including, 19th, century, mexican, scholars, who, saw, it, as, a, way, to, distinguish, present, day, mexicans, from, pre, conquest, mexicans, this, usage, has, been, the, subject, of, debate, in, more, recent, years, but, the, term, aztec, is, still, more, common, knowledge, of, aztec, society, rests, on, several, different, sources, the, many, archeological, remains, of, everything, from, temple, pyramids, to, thatched, huts, can, be, used, to, understand, many, of, the, aspects, of, what, the, aztec, world, was, like, however, archeologists, often, must, rely, on, knowledge, from, other, sources, to, interpret, the, historical, context, of, artifacts, there, are, many, written, texts, by, the, indigenous, people, and, spaniards, of, the, early, colonial, period, that, contain, invaluable, information, about, pre, colonial, aztec, history, these, texts, provide, insight, into, the, political, histories, of, various, aztec, city, states, and, their, ruling, lineages, such, histories, were, produced, as, well, in, pictorial, codices, some, of, these, manuscripts, were, entirely, pictorial, often, with, glyphs, in, the, postconquest, era, many, other, texts, were, written, in, latin, script, by, either, literate, aztecs, or, by, spanish, friars, who, interviewed, the, native, people, about, their, customs, and, stories, an, important, pictorial, and, alphabetic, text, produced, in, the, early, sixteenth, century, was, codex, mendoza, named, after, the, first, viceroy, of, mexico, and, perhaps, commissioned, by, him, to, inform, the, spanish, crown, about, the, political, and, economic, structure, of, the, aztec, empire, it, has, information, naming, the, polities, that, the, triple, alliance, conquered, the, types, of, taxes, rendered, to, the, aztec, empire, and, the, class, gender, structure, of, their, society, many, written, annals, exist, written, by, local, nahua, historians, recording, the, histories, of, their, polity, these, annals, used, pictorial, histories, and, were, subsequently, transformed, into, alphabetic, annals, in, latin, script, well, known, native, chroniclers, and, annalists, are, chimalpahin, of, amecameca, chalco, fernando, alvarado, tezozomoc, of, tenochtitlan, alva, ixtlilxochitl, of, texcoco, juan, bautista, pomar, of, texcoco, and, diego, mu, oz, camargo, of, tlaxcala, there, are, also, many, accounts, by, spanish, conquerors, who, participated, in, the, spanish, invasion, such, as, bernal, d, az, del, castillo, who, wrote, a, full, history, of, the, conquest, spanish, friars, also, produced, documentation, in, chronicles, and, other, types, of, accounts, of, key, importance, is, toribio, de, benavente, motolinia, one, of, the, first, twelve, franciscans, arriving, in, mexico, in, 1524, another, franciscan, of, great, importance, was, fray, juan, de, torquemada, author, of, monarquia, indiana, dominican, diego, dur, n, also, wrote, extensively, about, pre, hispanic, religion, as, well, as, the, history, of, the, mexica, an, invaluable, source, of, information, about, many, aspects, of, aztec, religious, thought, political, and, social, structure, as, well, as, the, history, of, the, spanish, conquest, from, the, mexica, viewpoint, is, the, florentine, codex, produced, between, 1545, and, 1576, in, the, form, of, an, ethnographic, encyclopedia, written, bilingually, in, spanish, and, nahuatl, by, franciscan, friar, bernardino, de, sahag, n, and, indigenous, informants, and, scribes, it, contains, knowledge, about, many, aspects, of, precolonial, society, from, religion, calendrics, botany, zoology, trades, and, crafts, and, history, another, source, of, knowledge, is, the, cultures, and, customs, of, the, contemporary, nahuatl, speakers, who, can, often, provide, insights, into, what, prehispanic, ways, of, life, may, have, been, like, scholarly, study, of, aztec, civilization, is, most, often, based, on, scientific, and, multidisciplinary, methodologies, combining, archeological, knowledge, with, ethnohistorical, and, ethnographic, information, it, is, a, matter, of, debate, whether, the, enormous, city, of, teotihuacan, was, inhabited, by, speakers, of, nahuatl, or, whether, nahuas, had, not, yet, arrived, in, central, mexico, in, the, classic, period, it, is, generally, agreed, that, the, nahua, peoples, were, not, indigenous, to, the, highlands, of, central, mexico, but, that, they, gradually, migrated, into, the, region, from, somewhere, in, northwestern, mexico, at, the, fall, of, teotihuacan, in, the, 6th, century, ce, some, city, states, rose, to, power, in, central, mexico, some, of, them, including, cholula, and, xochicalco, probably, inhabited, by, nahuatl, speakers, one, study, has, suggested, that, nahuas, originally, inhabited, the, baj, o, area, around, guanajuato, which, reached, a, population, peak, in, the, 6th, century, after, which, the, population, quickly, diminished, during, a, subsequent, dry, period, this, depopulation, of, the, baj, o, coincided, with, an, incursion, of, new, populations, into, the, valley, of, mexico, which, suggests, that, this, marks, the, influx, of, nahuatl, speakers, into, the, region, these, people, populated, central, mexico, dislocating, speakers, of, oto, manguean, languages, as, they, spread, their, political, influence, south, as, the, former, nomadic, hunter, gatherer, peoples, mixed, with, the, complex, civilizations, of, mesoamerica, adopting, religious, and, cultural, practices, the, foundation, for, later, aztec, culture, was, laid, after, 900, ce, during, the, postclassic, period, many, sites, almost, certainly, inhabited, by, nahuatl, speakers, became, powerful, among, them, are, the, site, of, tula, hidalgo, and, also, city, states, such, as, tenayuca, and, colhuacan, in, the, valley, of, mexico, and, cuauhnahuac, in, morelos, in, the, ethnohistorical, sources, from, the, colonial, period, the, mexica, themselves, describe, their, arrival, in, the, valley, of, mexico, the, ethnonym, aztec, nahuatl, aztecah, means, people, from, aztlan, aztlan, being, a, mythical, place, of, origin, toward, the, north, hence, the, term, applied, to, all, those, peoples, who, claimed, to, carry, the, heritage, from, this, mythical, place, the, migration, stories, of, the, mexica, tribe, tell, how, they, traveled, with, other, tribes, including, the, tlaxcalteca, tepaneca, and, acolhua, but, that, eventually, their, tribal, deity, huitzilopochtli, told, them, to, split, from, the, other, aztec, tribes, and, take, on, the, name, mexica, at, the, time, of, their, arrival, there, were, many, aztec, city, states, in, the, region, the, most, powerful, were, colhuacan, to, the, south, and, azcapotzalco, to, the, west, the, tepanecs, of, azcapotzalco, soon, expelled, the, mexica, from, chapultepec, and, executed, the, first, aztec, royal, family, except, queen, chimalxochitl, ii, in, 1299, colhuacan, ruler, cocoxtli, permitted, them, to, settle, in, the, empty, barrens, of, tizapan, where, they, were, eventually, assimilated, into, culhuacan, culture, the, noble, lineage, of, colhuacan, traced, its, roots, back, to, the, legendary, city, state, of, tula, and, by, marrying, into, colhua, families, the, mexica, now, appropriated, this, heritage, after, living, in, colhuacan, the, mexica, were, again, expelled, and, were, forced, to, move, according, to, aztec, legend, in, 1323, the, mexica, were, shown, a, vision, of, an, eagle, perched, on, a, prickly, pear, cactus, eating, a, snake, the, vision, indicated, the, location, where, they, were, to, build, their, settlement, the, mexica, founded, tenochtitlan, on, a, small, swampy, island, in, lake, texcoco, the, inland, lake, of, the, basin, of, mexico, the, year, of, foundation, is, usually, given, as, 1325, in, 1376, the, mexica, royal, dynasty, was, founded, when, acamapichtli, son, of, a, mexica, father, and, a, colhua, mother, was, elected, as, the, first, huey, tlatoani, of, tenochtitlan, in, the, first, 50, years, after, the, founding, of, the, mexica, dynasty, the, mexica, were, a, tributary, of, azcapotzalco, which, had, become, a, major, regional, power, under, the, ruler, tezozomoc, the, mexica, supplied, the, tepaneca, with, warriors, for, their, successful, conquest, campaigns, in, the, region, and, received, part, of, the, tribute, from, the, conquered, city, states, in, this, way, the, political, standing, and, economy, of, tenochtitlan, gradually, grew, in, 1396, at, acamapichtli, s, death, his, son, huitzilihhuitl, lit, hummingbird, feather, became, ruler, married, to, tezozomoc, s, daughter, the, relationship, with, azcapotzalco, remained, close, chimalpopoca, lit, she, smokes, like, a, shield, son, of, huitzilihhuitl, became, ruler, of, tenochtitlan, in, 1417, in, 1418, azcapotzalco, initiated, a, war, against, the, acolhua, of, texcoco, and, killed, their, ruler, ixtlilxochitl, even, though, ixtlilxochitl, was, married, to, chimalpopoca, s, daughter, the, mexica, ruler, continued, to, support, tezozomoc, tezozomoc, died, in, 1426, and, his, sons, began, a, struggle, for, the, rulership, of, azcapotzalco, during, this, power, struggle, chimalpopoca, died, probably, killed, by, tezozomoc, s, son, maxtla, who, saw, him, as, a, competitor, itzcoatl, brother, of, huitzilihhuitl, and, uncle, of, chimalpopoca, was, elected, the, next, mexica, tlatoani, the, mexica, were, now, in, open, war, with, azcapotzalco, and, itzcoatl, petitioned, for, an, alliance, with, nezahualcoyotl, son, of, the, slain, texcocan, ruler, ixtlilxochitl, against, maxtla, itzcoatl, also, allied, with, maxtla, s, brother, totoquihuaztli, ruler, of, the, tepanec, city, of, tlacopan, the, triple, alliance, of, tenochtitlan, texcoco, and, tlacopan, besieged, azcapotzalco, and, in, 1428, they, destroyed, the, city, and, sacrificed, maxtla, through, this, victory, tenochtitlan, became, the, dominant, city, state, in, the, valley, of, mexico, and, the, alliance, between, the, three, city, states, provided, the, basis, on, which, the, aztec, empire, was, built, itzcoatl, proceeded, by, securing, a, power, basis, for, tenochtitlan, by, conquering, the, city, states, on, the, southern, lake, including, culhuacan, xochimilco, cuitlahuac, and, mizquic, these, states, had, an, economy, based, on, highly, productive, chinampa, agriculture, cultivating, human, made, extensions, of, rich, soil, in, the, shallow, lake, xochimilco, itzcoatl, then, undertook, further, conquests, in, the, valley, of, morelos, subjecting, the, city, state, of, cuauhnahuac, today, cuernavaca, in, 1440, moteuczomatzin, ilhuicamina, lit, he, frowns, like, a, lord, he, shoots, the, sky, was, elected, tlatoani, he, was, the, son, of, huitzilihhuitl, brother, of, chimalpopoca, and, had, served, as, the, war, leader, of, his, uncle, itzcoatl, in, the, war, against, the, tepanecs, the, accession, of, a, new, ruler, in, the, dominant, city, state, was, often, an, occasion, for, subjected, cities, to, rebel, by, refusing, to, pay, taxes, this, meant, that, new, rulers, began, their, rule, with, a, coronation, campaign, often, against, rebellious, provinces, but, also, sometimes, demonstrating, their, military, might, by, making, new, conquests, motecuzoma, tested, the, attitudes, of, the, cities, around, the, valley, by, requesting, laborers, for, the, enlargement, of, the, great, temple, of, tenochtitlan, only, the, city, of, chalco, refused, to, provide, laborers, and, hostilities, between, chalco, and, tenochtitlan, would, persist, until, the, 1450s, motecuzoma, then, reconquered, the, cities, in, the, valley, of, morelos, and, guerrero, and, then, later, undertook, new, conquests, in, the, huaxtec, region, of, northern, veracruz, and, the, mixtec, region, of, coixtlahuaca, and, large, parts, of, oaxaca, and, later, again, in, central, and, southern, veracruz, with, conquests, at, cosamalopan, ahuilizapan, and, cuetlaxtlan, during, this, period, the, city, states, of, tlaxcalan, cholula, and, huexotzinco, emerged, as, major, competitors, to, the, imperial, expansion, and, they, supplied, warriors, to, several, of, the, cities, conquered, motecuzoma, therefore, initiated, a, state, of, low, intensity, warfare, against, these, three, cities, staging, minor, skirmishes, called, flower, wars, nahuatl, xochiyaoyotl, against, them, perhaps, as, a, strategy, of, exhaustion, motecuzoma, i, also, consolidated, the, political, structure, of, the, triple, alliance, and, the, internal, political, organization, of, tenochtitlan, his, brother, tlacaelel, served, as, his, main, advisor, nahuatl, languages, cihuacoatl, and, he, is, considered, the, architect, of, major, political, reforms, in, this, period, consolidating, the, power, of, the, noble, class, nahuatl, languages, pipiltin, and, instituting, a, set, of, legal, codes, and, the, practice, of, reinstating, conquered, rulers, in, their, cities, bound, by, fealty, to, the, mexica, tlatoani, in, 1469, the, next, ruler, was, axayacatl, lit, water, mask, son, of, itzcoatl, s, son, tezozomoc, and, motecuzoma, i, s, daughter, atotoztli, ii, he, undertook, a, successful, coronation, campaign, far, south, of, tenochtitlan, against, the, zapotecs, in, the, isthmus, of, tehuantepec, axayacatl, also, conquered, the, independent, mexica, city, of, tlatelolco, located, on, the, northern, part, of, the, island, where, tenochtitlan, was, also, located, the, tlatelolco, ruler, moquihuix, was, married, to, axayacatl, s, sister, and, his, alleged, mistreatment, of, her, was, used, as, an, excuse, to, incorporate, tlatelolco, and, its, important, market, directly, under, the, control, of, the, tlatoani, of, tenochtitlan, axayacatl, then, conquered, areas, in, central, guerrero, the, puebla, valley, on, the, gulf, coast, and, against, the, otomi, and, matlatzinca, in, the, toluca, valley, the, toluca, valley, was, a, buffer, zone, against, the, powerful, tarascan, state, in, michoacan, against, which, axayacatl, turned, next, in, the, major, campaign, against, the, tarascans, nahuatl, languages, michhuahqueh, in, 1478, 1479, the, aztec, forces, were, repelled, by, a, well, organized, defense, axayacatl, was, soundly, defeated, in, a, battle, at, tlaximaloyan, today, tajimaroa, losing, most, of, his, 32, 000, men, and, only, barely, escaping, back, to, tenochtitlan, with, the, remnants, of, his, army, in, 1481, at, axayacatls, death, his, older, brother, tizoc, was, elected, ruler, tizoc, s, coronation, campaign, against, the, otomi, of, metztitlan, failed, as, he, lost, the, major, battle, and, only, managed, to, secure, 40, prisoners, to, be, sacrificed, for, his, coronation, ceremony, having, shown, weakness, many, cities, rebelled, and, consequently, most, of, tizoc, s, short, reign, was, spent, attempting, to, quell, rebellions, and, maintain, control, of, areas, conquered, by, his, predecessors, tizoc, died, suddenly, in, 1485, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, he, was, poisoned, by, his, brother, and, war, leader, ahuitzotl, who, became, the, next, tlatoani, tizoc, is, mostly, known, as, the, namesake, of, the, stone, of, tizoc, a, monumental, sculpture, nahuatl, temalacatl, decorated, with, a, representation, of, tizoc, s, conquests, the, next, ruler, was, ahuitzotl, lit, water, monster, brother, of, axayacatl, and, tizoc, and, war, leader, under, tizoc, his, successful, coronation, campaign, suppressed, rebellions, in, the, toluca, valley, and, conquered, jilotepec, and, several, communities, in, the, northern, valley, of, mexico, a, second, 1521, campaign, to, the, gulf, coast, was, also, highly, successful, he, began, an, enlargement, of, the, great, temple, of, tenochtitlan, inaugurating, the, new, temple, in, 1487, for, the, inauguration, ceremony, the, mexica, invited, the, rulers, of, all, their, subject, cities, who, participated, as, spectators, in, the, ceremony, in, which, an, unprecedented, number, of, war, captives, were, sacrificed, some, sources, giving, a, figure, of, 80, 400, prisoners, sacrificed, over, four, days, probably, the, actual, figure, of, sacrifices, was, much, smaller, but, still, numbering, several, thousand, there, have, never, been, found, enough, skulls, in, the, capital, to, satisfy, even, the, most, conservative, figures, ahuitzotl, also, constructed, monumental, architecture, in, sites, such, as, calixtlahuaca, malinalco, and, tepoztlan, after, a, rebellion, in, the, towns, of, alahuiztlan, and, oztoticpac, in, northern, guerrero, he, ordered, the, entire, population, executed, and, repopulated, with, people, from, the, valley, of, mexico, he, also, constructed, a, fortified, garrison, at, oztuma, defending, the, border, against, the, tarascan, state, motecuhzoma, xocoyotzin, is, known, to, world, history, as, the, aztec, ruler, when, the, spanish, invaders, and, their, indigenous, allies, began, their, conquest, of, the, empire, in, a, two, year, long, campaign, 1519, 1521, his, early, rule, did, not, hint, at, his, future, fame, he, succeeded, in, the, rulership, after, the, death, of, ahuitzotl, motecuhzoma, xocoyotzin, lit, he, frowns, like, a, lord, the, youngest, child, who, is, dead, as, he, had, lived, in, life, but, not, death, was, a, son, of, axayacatl, and, a, war, leader, he, began, his, rule, in, standard, fashion, conducting, a, coronation, campaign, to, demonstrate, his, skills, as, a, leader, he, attacked, the, fortified, city, of, nopallan, in, oaxaca, and, subjected, the, adjacent, region, to, the, empire, an, effective, warrior, moctezuma, maintained, the, pace, of, conquest, set, by, his, predecessor, and, subjected, large, areas, in, guerrero, oaxaca, puebla, and, even, far, south, along, the, pacific, and, gulf, coasts, conquering, the, province, of, xoconochco, in, chiapas, he, also, intensified, the, flower, wars, waged, against, tlaxcala, and, huexotzinco, and, secured, an, alliance, with, cholula, he, also, consolidated, the, class, structure, of, aztec, society, by, making, it, harder, for, commoners, nahuatl, languages, macehualtin, to, accede, to, the, privileged, class, of, the, pipiltin, through, merit, in, combat, he, also, instituted, a, strict, sumptuary, code, limiting, the, types, of, luxury, goods, that, could, be, consumed, by, commoners, in, 1517, moctezuma, received, the, first, news, of, ships, with, strange, warriors, having, landed, on, the, gulf, coast, near, cempoallan, and, he, dispatched, messengers, to, greet, them, and, find, out, what, was, happening, and, he, ordered, his, subjects, in, the, area, to, keep, him, informed, of, any, new, arrivals, in, 1519, he, was, informed, of, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, fleet, of, hern, n, cort, s, who, soon, marched, toward, tlaxcala, where, he, allied, with, the, traditional, enemies, of, the, aztecs, on, 8, november, 1519, moctezuma, ii, received, cort, s, and, his, troops, and, tlaxcalan, allies, on, the, causeway, south, of, tenochtitlan, and, he, invited, the, spaniards, to, stay, as, his, guests, in, tenochtitlan, when, aztec, troops, destroyed, a, spanish, camp, on, the, gulf, coast, cort, s, ordered, moctezuma, to, execute, the, commanders, responsible, for, the, attack, and, moctezuma, complied, at, this, point, the, power, balance, had, shifted, toward, the, spaniards, who, now, held, moctezuma, as, a, prisoner, in, his, palace, as, this, shift, in, power, became, clear, to, moctezuma, s, subjects, the, spaniards, became, increasingly, unwelcome, in, the, capital, city, and, in, june, 1520, hostilities, broke, out, culminating, in, the, massacre, in, the, great, temple, and, a, major, uprising, of, the, mexica, against, the, spanish, during, the, fighting, moctezuma, was, killed, either, by, the, spaniards, who, killed, him, as, they, fled, the, city, or, by, the, mexica, themselves, who, considered, him, a, traitor, cuitl, huac, a, kinsman, and, adviser, to, moctezuma, succeeded, him, as, tlatoani, mounting, the, defense, of, tenochtitlan, against, the, spanish, invaders, and, their, indigenous, allies, he, ruled, for, only, 80, days, perhaps, dying, in, a, smallpox, epidemic, although, early, sources, do, not, give, the, cause, he, was, succeeded, by, cuauht, moc, the, last, independent, mexica, tlatoani, who, continued, the, fierce, defense, of, tenochtitlan, the, aztecs, were, weakened, by, disease, and, the, spanish, enlisted, tens, of, thousands, of, indian, allies, especially, tlaxcalans, for, the, assault, on, tenochtitlan, after, the, siege, and, destruction, of, the, aztec, capital, cuauht, moc, was, captured, on, 13, august, 1521, marking, the, beginning, of, spanish, hegemony, in, central, mexico, spaniards, held, cuauht, moc, captive, until, he, was, tortured, and, executed, on, the, orders, of, cort, s, supposedly, for, treason, during, an, ill, fated, expedition, to, honduras, in, 1525, his, death, marked, the, end, of, a, tumultuous, era, in, aztec, political, history, after, the, fall, of, the, aztec, empire, entire, nahua, communities, were, subject, to, forced, labor, under, the, encomienda, system, the, aztec, education, system, was, abolished, and, replaced, by, a, very, limited, church, education, and, aztec, religious, practices, were, forcibly, replaced, with, catholicism, the, highest, class, was, the, p, piltin, or, nobility, the, pilli, status, was, hereditary, and, ascribed, certain, privileges, to, its, holders, such, as, the, right, to, wear, particularly, fine, garments, and, consume, luxury, goods, as, well, as, to, own, land, and, direct, corvee, labor, by, commoners, the, most, powerful, nobles, were, called, lords, nahuatl, languages, teuctin, and, they, owned, and, controlled, noble, estates, or, houses, and, could, serve, in, the, highest, government, positions, or, as, military, leaders, nobles, made, up, about, five, percent, of, the, population, the, second, class, was, the, m, cehualtin, originally, peasants, but, later, extended, to, the, lower, working, classes, in, general, eduardo, noguera, estimates, that, in, later, stages, only, 20, percent, of, the, population, was, dedicated, to, agriculture, and, food, production, the, other, 80, percent, of, society, were, warriors, artisans, and, traders, eventually, most, of, the, m, cehuallis, were, dedicated, to, arts, and, crafts, their, works, were, an, important, source, of, income, for, the, city, macehualtin, could, become, enslaved, nahuatl, languages, tlacotin, for, example, if, they, had, to, sell, themselves, into, the, service, of, a, noble, due, to, debt, or, poverty, but, enslavement, was, not, an, inherited, status, among, the, aztecs, some, macehualtin, were, landless, and, worked, directly, for, a, lord, nahuatl, languages, mayehqueh, whereas, the, majority, of, commoners, were, organized, into, calpollis, which, gave, them, access, to, land, and, property, commoners, were, able, to, obtain, privileges, similar, to, those, of, the, nobles, by, demonstrating, prowess, in, warfare, when, a, warrior, took, a, captive, he, accrued, the, right, to, use, certain, emblems, weapons, or, garments, and, as, he, took, more, captives, his, rank, and, prestige, increased, the, aztec, family, pattern, was, bilateral, counting, relatives, on, the, father, s, and, mother, s, side, of, the, family, equally, and, inheritance, was, also, passed, both, to, sons, and, daughters, this, meant, that, women, could, own, property, just, as, men, and, that, women, therefore, had, a, good, deal, of, economic, freedom, from, their, spouses, nevertheless, aztec, society, was, highly, gendered, with, separate, gender, roles, for, men, and, women, men, were, expected, to, work, outside, of, the, house, as, farmers, traders, craftsmen, and, warriors, whereas, women, were, expected, to, take, responsibility, for, the, domestic, sphere, women, could, however, also, work, outside, of, the, home, as, small, scale, merchants, doctors, priests, and, midwives, warfare, was, highly, valued, and, a, source, of, high, prestige, but, women, s, work, was, metaphorically, conceived, of, as, equivalent, to, warfare, and, as, equally, important, in, maintaining, the, equilibrium, of, the, world, and, pleasing, the, gods, this, situation, has, led, some, scholars, to, describe, aztec, gender, ideology, as, an, ideology, not, of, a, gender, hierarchy, but, of, gender, complementarity, with, gender, roles, being, separate, but, equal, among, the, nobles, marriage, alliances, were, often, used, as, a, political, strategy, with, lesser, nobles, marrying, daughters, from, more, prestigious, lineages, whose, status, was, then, inherited, by, their, children, nobles, were, also, often, polygamous, with, lords, having, many, wives, polygamy, was, not, very, common, among, the, commoners, and, some, sources, describe, it, as, being, prohibited, the, main, unit, of, aztec, political, organization, was, the, city, state, in, nahuatl, called, the, altepetl, meaning, water, mountain, each, altepetl, was, led, by, a, ruler, a, tlatoani, with, authority, over, a, group, of, nobles, and, a, population, of, commoners, the, altepetl, included, a, capital, that, served, as, a, religious, center, the, hub, of, distribution, and, organization, of, a, local, population, that, often, lived, spread, out, in, minor, settlements, surrounding, the, capital, altepetl, was, also, the, main, source, of, ethnic, identity, for, the, inhabitants, even, though, altepetl, was, frequently, composed, of, groups, speaking, different, languages, each, altepetl, would, see, itself, as, standing, in, political, contrast, to, other, altepetl, polities, and, war, was, waged, between, altepetl, states, in, this, way, nahuatl, speaking, aztecs, of, one, altepetl, would, be, solidary, with, speakers, of, other, languages, belonging, to, the, same, altepetl, but, enemies, of, nahuatl, speakers, belonging, to, other, competing, altepetl, states, in, the, basin, of, mexico, altepetl, was, composed, of, subdivisions, called, calpolli, which, served, as, the, main, organizational, unit, for, commoners, in, tlaxcala, and, the, puebla, valley, the, altepetl, was, organized, into, teccalli, units, headed, by, a, lord, nahuatl, languages, tecutli, who, would, hold, sway, over, a, territory, and, distribute, rights, to, land, among, the, commoners, a, calpolli, was, at, once, a, territorial, unit, where, commoners, organized, labor, and, land, use, since, the, land, was, not, private, property, and, also, often, a, kinship, unit, as, a, network, of, families, that, were, related, through, intermarriage, calpolli, leaders, might, be, or, become, members, of, the, nobility, in, which, case, they, could, represent, their, calpolli, interests, in, the, altepetl, government, in, the, valley, of, morelos, archeologist, michael, e, smith, estimates, that, a, typical, altepetl, had, from, 10, 000, to, 15, 000, inhabitants, and, covered, an, area, between, 70, and, 100, square, kilometers, 27, and, 39, sq, mi, in, the, morelos, valley, altepetl, sizes, were, somewhat, smaller, smith, argues, that, the, altepetl, was, primarily, a, political, unit, made, up, of, the, population, with, allegiance, to, a, lord, rather, than, as, a, territorial, unit, he, makes, this, distinction, because, in, some, areas, minor, settlements, with, different, altepetl, allegiances, were, interspersed, the, aztec, empire, was, ruled, by, indirect, means, like, most, european, empires, it, was, ethnically, very, diverse, but, unlike, most, european, empires, it, was, more, of, a, hegemonic, confederacy, than, a, single, system, of, government, ethnohistorian, ross, hassig, has, argued, that, the, aztec, empire, is, best, understood, as, an, informal, or, hegemonic, empire, because, it, did, not, exert, supreme, authority, over, the, conquered, lands, it, merely, expected, taxes, to, be, paid, and, exerted, force, only, to, the, degree, it, was, necessary, to, ensure, the, payment, of, taxes, it, was, also, a, discontinuous, empire, because, not, all, dominated, territories, were, connected, for, example, the, southern, peripheral, zones, of, xoconochco, were, not, in, direct, contact, with, the, center, the, hegemonic, nature, of, the, aztec, empire, can, be, seen, in, the, fact, that, generally, local, rulers, were, restored, to, their, positions, once, their, city, state, was, conquered, and, the, aztecs, did, not, generally, interfere, in, local, affairs, as, long, as, the, tax, payments, were, made, and, the, local, elites, participated, willingly, such, compliance, was, secured, by, establishing, and, maintaining, a, network, of, elites, related, through, intermarriage, and, different, forms, of, exchange, nevertheless, the, expansion, of, the, empire, was, accomplished, through, military, control, of, frontier, zones, in, strategic, provinces, where, a, much, more, direct, approach, to, conquest, and, control, was, taken, such, strategic, provinces, were, often, exempt, from, taxation, the, aztecs, even, invested, in, those, areas, by, maintaining, a, permanent, military, presence, installing, puppet, rulers, or, even, moving, entire, populations, from, the, center, to, maintain, a, loyal, base, of, support, in, this, way, the, aztec, system, of, government, distinguished, between, different, strategies, of, control, in, the, outer, regions, of, the, empire, far, from, the, core, in, the, valley, of, mexico, some, provinces, were, treated, as, subject, provinces, which, provided, the, basis, for, economic, stability, for, the, empire, and, strategic, provinces, which, were, the, basis, for, further, expansion, although, the, form, of, government, is, often, referred, to, as, an, empire, most, areas, within, the, empire, were, organized, as, city, states, known, as, altepetl, in, nahuatl, these, were, small, polities, ruled, by, a, hereditary, leader, tlatoani, from, a, legitimate, noble, dynasty, the, early, aztec, period, was, a, time, of, growth, and, competition, among, altepetl, even, after, the, confederation, of, the, triple, alliance, was, formed, in, 1427, and, began, its, expansion, through, conquest, the, altepetl, remained, the, dominant, form, of, organization, at, the, local, level, the, efficient, role, of, the, altepetl, as, a, regional, political, unit, was, largely, responsible, for, the, success, of, the, empire, s, hegemonic, form, of, control, like, all, mesoamerican, peoples, aztec, society, was, organized, around, maize, agriculture, the, humid, environment, in, the, valley, of, mexico, with, its, many, lakes, and, swamps, permitted, intensive, agriculture, the, main, crops, in, addition, to, maize, were, beans, squashes, chilies, and, amaranth, particularly, important, for, agricultural, production, in, the, valley, was, the, construction, of, chinampas, on, the, lake, artificial, islands, that, allowed, the, conversion, of, the, shallow, waters, into, highly, fertile, gardens, that, could, be, cultivated, year, round, chinampas, are, human, made, extensions, of, agricultural, land, created, from, alternating, layers, of, mud, from, the, bottom, of, the, lake, and, plant, matter, and, other, vegetation, these, raised, beds, were, separated, by, narrow, canals, which, allowed, farmers, to, move, between, them, by, canoe, chinampas, were, extremely, fertile, pieces, of, land, and, yielded, on, average, seven, crops, annually, based, on, current, chinampa, yields, it, has, been, estimated, that, one, hectare, 2, 5, acres, of, chinampa, would, feed, 20, individuals, and, 9, 000, hectares, 22, 000, acres, of, chinampas, could, feed, 180, 000, the, aztecs, further, intensified, agricultural, production, by, constructing, systems, of, artificial, irrigation, while, most, of, the, farming, occurred, outside, the, densely, populated, areas, within, the, cities, there, was, another, method, of, small, scale, farming, each, family, had, a, garden, plot, where, they, grew, maize, fruits, herbs, medicines, and, other, important, plants, when, the, city, of, tenochtitlan, became, a, major, urban, center, water, was, supplied, to, the, city, through, aqueducts, from, springs, on, the, banks, of, the, lake, and, they, organized, a, system, that, collected, human, waste, for, use, as, fertilizer, through, intensive, agriculture, the, aztecs, were, able, to, sustain, a, large, urbanized, population, the, lake, was, also, a, rich, source, of, proteins, in, the, form, of, aquatic, animals, such, as, fish, amphibians, shrimp, insects, and, insect, eggs, and, waterfowl, the, presence, of, such, varied, sources, of, protein, meant, that, there, was, little, use, for, domestic, animals, for, meat, only, turkeys, and, dogs, were, kept, and, scholars, have, calculated, that, there, was, no, shortage, of, protein, among, the, inhabitants, of, the, valley, of, mexico, the, excess, supply, of, food, products, allowed, a, significant, portion, of, the, aztec, population, to, dedicate, themselves, to, trades, other, than, food, production, apart, from, taking, care, of, domestic, food, production, women, weaved, textiles, from, agave, fibers, and, cotton, men, also, engaged, in, craft, specializations, such, as, the, production, of, ceramics, and, obsidian, and, flint, tools, and, of, luxury, goods, such, as, beadwork, featherwork, and, the, elaboration, of, tools, and, musical, instruments, sometimes, entire, calpollis, specialized, in, a, single, craft, and, in, some, archeological, sites, large, neighborhoods, have, been, found, where, only, a, single, craft, specialty, was, practiced, the, aztecs, did, not, produce, much, metalwork, but, did, have, knowledge, of, basic, smelting, technology, for, gold, and, they, combined, gold, with, precious, stones, such, as, jade, and, turquoise, copper, products, were, generally, imported, from, the, tarascans, of, michoacan, products, were, distributed, through, a, network, of, markets, some, markets, specialized, in, a, single, commodity, e, g, the, dog, market, of, acolman, and, other, general, markets, with, the, presence, of, many, different, goods, markets, were, highly, organized, with, a, system, of, supervisors, taking, care, that, only, authorized, merchants, were, permitted, to, sell, their, goods, and, punishing, those, who, cheated, their, customers, or, sold, substandard, or, counterfeit, goods, a, typical, town, would, have, a, weekly, market, every, five, days, while, larger, cities, held, markets, every, day, cort, s, reported, that, the, central, market, of, tlatelolco, tenochtitlan, s, sister, city, was, visited, by, 60, 000, people, daily, some, sellers, in, the, markets, were, petty, vendors, farmers, might, sell, some, of, their, produce, potters, sold, their, vessels, and, so, on, other, vendors, were, professional, merchants, who, traveled, from, market, to, market, seeking, profits, the, pochteca, were, specialized, long, distance, merchants, organized, into, exclusive, guilds, they, made, long, expeditions, to, all, parts, of, mesoamerica, bringing, back, exotic, luxury, goods, and, they, served, as, the, judges, and, supervisors, of, the, tlatelolco, market, although, the, economy, of, aztec, mexico, was, commercialized, in, its, use, of, money, markets, and, merchants, land, and, labor, were, not, generally, commodities, for, sale, though, some, types, of, land, could, be, sold, between, nobles, in, the, commercial, sector, of, the, economy, several, types, of, money, were, in, regular, use, small, purchases, were, made, with, cacao, beans, which, had, to, be, imported, from, lowland, areas, in, aztec, marketplaces, a, small, rabbit, was, worth, 30, beans, a, turkey, egg, cost, three, beans, and, a, tamal, cost, a, single, bean, for, larger, purchases, standardized, lengths, of, cotton, cloth, called, quachtli, were, used, there, were, different, grades, of, quachtli, ranging, in, value, from, 65, to, 300, cacao, beans, about, 20, quachtli, could, support, a, commoner, for, one, year, in, tenochtitlan, another, form, of, distribution, of, goods, was, through, the, payment, of, taxes, when, an, altepetl, was, conquered, the, victor, imposed, a, yearly, tax, usually, paid, in, the, form, of, whichever, local, product, was, most, valuable, or, treasured, several, pages, from, the, codex, mendoza, list, subject, towns, along, with, the, goods, they, supplied, which, included, not, only, luxuries, such, as, feathers, adorned, suits, and, greenstone, beads, but, more, practical, goods, such, as, cloth, firewood, and, food, taxes, were, usually, paid, twice, or, four, times, a, year, at, differing, times, archaeological, excavations, in, the, aztec, ruled, provinces, show, that, incorporation, into, the, empire, had, both, costs, and, benefits, for, provincial, peoples, on, the, positive, side, the, empire, promoted, commerce, and, trade, and, exotic, goods, from, obsidian, to, bronze, managed, to, reach, the, houses, of, both, commoners, and, nobles, trade, partners, also, included, the, enemy, pur, pecha, also, known, as, tarascans, a, source, of, bronze, tools, and, jewelry, on, the, negative, side, imperial, taxes, imposed, a, burden, on, commoner, households, who, had, to, increase, their, work, to, pay, their, share, of, taxes, nobles, on, the, other, hand, often, made, out, well, under, the, imperial, rule, because, of, the, indirect, nature, of, imperial, organization, the, empire, had, to, rely, on, local, kings, and, nobles, and, offered, them, privileges, for, their, help, in, maintaining, order, and, keeping, the, tax, revenue, flowing, aztec, society, combined, a, relatively, simple, agrarian, rural, tradition, with, the, development, of, a, truly, urbanized, society, with, a, complex, system, of, institutions, specializations, and, hierarchies, the, urban, tradition, in, mesoamerica, was, developed, during, the, classic, period, with, major, urban, centers, such, as, teotihuacan, with, a, population, well, above, 100, 000, and, at, the, time, of, the, rise, of, the, aztecs, the, urban, tradition, was, ingrained, in, mesoamerican, society, with, urban, centers, serving, major, religious, political, and, economic, functions, for, the, entire, population, the, capital, city, of, the, aztec, empire, was, tenochtitlan, now, the, site, of, modern, day, mexico, city, built, on, a, series, of, islets, in, lake, texcoco, the, city, plan, was, based, on, a, symmetrical, layout, that, was, divided, into, four, city, sections, called, campan, directions, tenochtitlan, was, built, according, to, a, fixed, plan, and, centered, on, the, ritual,

temples, and, palaces, were, generally, made, of, stone, the, city, was, interlaced, with, canals, which, were, useful, for, transportation, anthropologist, eduardo, noguera, estimated, the, population, at, 200, 000, based, on, the, house, count, and, merging, the, population, of, tlatelolco, once, an, independent, city, but, later, became, a, suburb, of, tenochtitlan, if, one, includes, the, surrounding, islets, and, shores, surrounding, lake, texcoco, estimates, range, from, 300, 000, to, 700, 000, inhabitants, michael, e, smith, gives, a, somewhat, smaller, figure, of, 212, 500, inhabitants, of, tenochtitlan, based, on, an, area, of, 1, 350, hectares, 3, 300, acres, and, a, population, density, of, 157, inhabitants, per, hectare, 60, acre, the, second, largest, city, in, the, valley, of, mexico, in, the, aztec, period, was, texcoco, with, some, 25, 000, inhabitants, dispersed, over, 450, hectares, 1, 100, acres, the, center, of, tenochtitlan, was, the, sacred, precinct, a,

tenochtitlan, was, the, templo, mayor, the, great, temple, a, large, stepped, pyramid, with, a, double, staircase, leading, up, to, two, twin, shrines, one, dedicated, to, tlaloc, the, other, to, huitzilopochtli, this, was, where, most, of, the, human, sacrifices, were, carried, out, during, the, ritual, festivals, and, the, bodies, of, sacrificial, victims, were, thrown, down, the, stairs, the, temple, was, enlarged, in, several, stages, and, most, of, the, aztec, rulers, made, a, point, of, adding, a, further, stage, each, with, a, new, dedication, and, inauguration, the, temple, has, been, excavated, in, the, center, of, mexico, city, and, the, rich, dedicatory, offerings, are, displayed, in, the, museum, of, the, templo, mayor, archeologist, eduardo, matos, moctezuma, in, his, essay, symbolism, of, the, templo, mayor, posits, that, the, orientation, of, the, temple, is, indicative, of, the, totality, of, the, vision, the, mexica, had, of, the, universe, cosmovision, he, states, that, the, principal, center, or, navel, where, the, horizontal, and, vertical, planes, intersect, that, is, the, point, from, which, the, heavenly, or, upper, plane, and, the, plane, of, the, underworld, begin, and, the, four, directions, of, the, universe, originate, is, the, templo, mayor, of, tenochtitlan, matos, moctezuma, supports, his, supposition, by, claiming, that, the, temple, acts, as, an, embodiment, of, a, living, myth, where, all, sacred, power, is, concentrated, and, where, all, the, levels, intersect, other, major, aztec, cities, were, some, of, the, previous, city,

speaking, tlahuica, tribe, and, tollocan, in, the, toluca, valley, was, the, capital, of, the, matlatzinca, tribe, which, included, nahuatl, speakers, as, well, as, speakers, of, otomi, and, the, language, today, called, matlatzinca, most, aztec, cities, had, a, similar, layout, with, a, central, plaza, with, a, major, pyramid, with, two, staircases, and, a, double, temple, oriented, toward, the, west, nahuas, metaphysics, centers, around, teotl, a, single, dynamic, vivifying, eternally, self, generating, and, self, regenerating, sacred, power, energy, or, force, this, is, conceptualized, in, a, kind, of, monistic, pantheism, as, manifest, in, the, supreme, god, ometeotl, as, well, as, a, large, pantheon, of, lesser, gods, and, idealizations, of, natural, phenomena, such, as, stars, and, fire, priests, and, educated, upper, classes, held, more, monistic, views, while, the, popular, religion, of, the, uneducated, tended, to, embrace, the, polytheistic, and, mythological, aspects, in, common, with, many, other, indigenous, mesoamerican, civilizations, the, aztecs, put, great, ritual, emphasis, on, calendrics, and, scheduled, festivals, government, ceremonies, and, even, war, around, key, transition, dates, in, the, aztec, calendar, public, ritual, practices, could, involve, food, storytelling, and, dance, as, well, as, ceremonial, warfare, the, mesoamerican, ballgame, and, human, sacrifice, as, a, manner, of, payment, for, or, even, effecting, the, continuation, of, the, days, and, the, cycle, of, life, the, four, main, deities, worshiped, by, the, aztecs, were, tlaloc, huitzilopochtli, quetzalcoatl, and, tezcatlipoca, tlaloc, is, a, rain, and, storm, deity, huitzilopochtli, a, solar, and, martial, deity, and, the, tutelary, deity, of, the, mexica, tribe, quetzalcoatl, a, wind, sky, and, star, deity, and, cultural, hero, and, tezcatlipoca, a, deity, of, the, night, magic, prophecy, and, fate, the, great, temple, in, tenochtitlan, had, two, shrines, on, its, top, one, dedicated, to, tlaloc, the, other, to, huitzilopochtli, the, two, shrines, represented, two, sacred, mountains, the, left, one, was, tonacatepetl, the, hill, of, sustenance, whose, patron, god, was, tlaloc, and, the, right, one, was, coatepec, whose, patron, god, was, huitzilopochtli, quetzalcoatl, and, tezcatlipoca, each, had, separate, temples, within, the, religious, precinct, close, to, the, great, temple, and, the, high, priests, of, the, great, temple, were, named, quetzalcoatl, tlamacazqueh, other, major, deities, were, tlaltecutli, or, coatlicue, a, female, earth, deity, the, deity, couple, tonacatecuhtli, and, tonacacihuatl, associated, with, life, and, sustenance, mictlantecutli, and, mictlancihuatl, a, male, and, female, couple, of, deities, that, represented, the, underworld, and, death, chalchiutlicue, a, female, deity, of, lakes, and, springs, xipe, totec, a, deity, of, fertility, and, the, natural, cycle, huehueteotl, or, xiuhtecuhtli, a,

mixcoatl, or, camaxtli, was, the, main, tribal, deity, a, few, sources, mention, a, binary, deity, ometeotl, who, may, have, been, a, god, of, the, duality, between, life, and, death, male, and, female, and, who, may, have, incorporated, tonacatecuhtli, and, tonacacihuatl, some, historians, argue, against, the, notion, that, ometeotl, was, a, dual, god, claiming, that, scholars, are, applying, their, preconceived, ideas, onto, translated, texts, apart, from, the, major, deities, there, were, dozens, of, minor, deities, each, associated, with, an, element, or, concept, and, as, the, aztec, empire, grew, so, did, their, pantheon, because, they, adopted, and, incorporated, the, local, deities, of, conquered, people, into, their, own, additionally, the, major, gods, had, many, alternative, manifestations, or, aspects, creating, small, families, of, gods, with, related, aspects, aztec, mythology, is, known, from, many, sources, written, down, in, the, colonial, period, one, set, of, myths, called, legend, of, the, suns, describes, the, creation, of, four, successive, suns, or, periods, each, ruled, by, a, different, deity, and, inhabited, by, a, different, group, of, beings, each, period, ends, in, a, cataclysmic, destruction, that, sets, the, stage, for, the, next, period, to, begin, in, this, process, the, deities, tezcatlipoca, and, quetzalcoatl, appear, as, adversaries, each, destroying, the, creations, of, the, other, the, current, sun, the, fifth, was, created, when, a, minor, deity, sacrificed, himself, on, a, bonfire, and, turned, into, the, sun, but, the, sun, only, begins, to, move, once, the, other, deities, sacrifice, themselves, and, offer, it, their, life, force, in, another, myth, of, how, the, earth, was, created, tezcatlipoca, and, quetzalcoatl, appear, as, allies, defeating, a, giant, crocodile, cipactli, and, requiring, her, to, become, the, earth, allowing, humans, to, carve, into, her, flesh, and, plant, their, seeds, on, the, condition, that, in, return, they, will, offer, blood, to, her, in, the, story, of, the, creation, of, humanity, quetzalcoatl, travels, with, his, twin, xolotl, to, the, underworld, and, brings, back, bones, which, are, then, ground, like, corn, on, a, metate, by, the, goddess, cihuacoatl, the, resulting, dough, is, given, human, form, and, comes, to, life, when, quetzalcoatl, imbues, it, with, his, blood, huitzilopochtli, is, the, deity, tied, to, the, mexica, tribe, and, he, figures, in, the, story, of, the, origin, and, migrations, of, the, tribe, on, their, journey, huitzilopochtli, in, the, form, of, a, deity, bundle, carried, by, the, mexica, priest, continuously, spurs, the, tribe, by, pushing, them, into, conflict, with, their, neighbors, whenever, they, are, settled, in, a, place, in, another, myth, huitzilopochtli, defeats, and, dismembers, his, sister, the, lunar, deity, coyolxauhqui, and, her, four, hundred, brothers, at, the, hill, of, coatepetl, the, southern, side, of, the, great, temple, also, called, coatepetl, was, a, representation, of, this, myth, and, at, the, foot, of, the, stairs, lay, a, large, stone, monolith, carved, with, a, representation, of, the, dismembered, goddess, aztec, religious, life, was, organized, around, the, calendars, like, most, mesoamerican, people, the, aztecs, used, two, calendars, simultaneously, a, ritual, calendar, of, 260, days, called, the, tonalpohualli, and, a, solar, calendar, of, 365, days, called, the, xiuhpohualli, each, day, had, a, name, and, number, in, both, calendars, and, the, combination, of, two, dates, was, unique, within, 52, years, the, tonalpohualli, was, mostly, used, for, divinatory, purposes, and, it, consisted, of, 20, day, signs, and, number, coefficients, of, 1, 13, that, cycled, in, a, fixed, order, the, xiuhpohualli, was, made, up, of, 18, months, of, 20, days, and, with, a, remainder, of, five, void, days, at, the, end, of, a, cycle, before, the, new, xiuhpohualli, cycle, began, each, 20, day, month, was, named, after, the, specific, ritual, festival, that, began, the, month, many, of, which, contained, a, relation, to, the, agricultural, cycle, whether, and, how, the, aztec, calendar, was, corrected, for, leap, year, is, a, matter, of, discussion, among, specialists, the, monthly, rituals, involved, the, entire, population, as, rituals, were, performed, in, each, household, in, the, calpolli, temples, and, the, main, sacred, precinct, many, festivals, involved, different, forms, of, dancing, as, well, as, the, reenactment, of, mythical, narratives, by, deity, impersonators, and, the, offering, of, sacrifice, in, the, form, of, food, animals, and, human, victims, every, 52, years, the, two, calendars, reached, their, shared, starting, point, and, a, new, calendar, cycle, began, this, calendar, event, was, celebrated, with, a, ritual, known, as, xiuhmolpilli, or, the, new, fire, ceremony, in, this, ceremony, old, pottery, was, broken, in, all, homes, and, all, fires, in, the, aztec, realm, were, put, out, then, a, new, fire, was, drilled, over, the, breast, of, a, sacrificial, victim, and, runners, brought, the, new, fire, to, the, different, calpolli, communities, where, fire, was, redistributed, to, each, home, the, night, without, fire, was, associated, with, the, fear, that, star, demons, tzitzimimeh, might, descend, and, devour, the, earth, ending, the, fifth, period, of, the, sun, to, the, aztecs, death, was, instrumental, in, the, perpetuation, of, creation, and, gods, and, humans, alike, had, the, responsibility, of, sacrificing, themselves, to, allow, life, to, continue, as, described, in, the, myth, of, creation, above, humans, were, understood, to, be, responsible, for, the, sun, s, continued, revival, as, well, as, for, paying, the, earth, for, its, continued, fertility, blood, sacrifice, in, various, forms, was, conducted, both, humans, and, animals, were, sacrificed, depending, on, the, god, to, be, placated, and, the, ceremony, being, conducted, and, priests, of, some, gods, were, sometimes, required, to, provide, their, blood, through, self, mutilation, it, is, known, that, some, rituals, included, acts, of, cannibalism, with, the, captor, and, his, family, consuming, part, of, the, flesh, of, their, sacrificed, captives, but, it, is, not, known, how, widespread, this, practice, was, while, human, sacrifice, was, practiced, throughout, mesoamerica, the, aztecs, according, to, their, accounts, brought, this, practice, to, an, unprecedented, level, for, example, for, the, reconsecration, of, the, great, pyramid, of, tenochtitlan, in, 1487, aztec, and, spanish, sources, later, said, that, 80, 400, prisoners, were, sacrificed, over, four, days, reportedly, by, ahuitzotl, the, great, speaker, himself, this, number, however, is, considered, by, many, scholars, as, wildly, exaggerated, other, estimates, place, the, number, of, human, sacrifices, at, between, 1, 000, and, 20, 000, annually, the, scale, of, aztec, human, sacrifice, has, provoked, many, scholars, to, consider, what, may, have, been, the, driving, factor, behind, this, aspect, of, aztec, religion, in, the, 1970s, michael, harner, and, marvin, harris, argued, that, the, motivation, behind, human, sacrifice, among, the, aztecs, was, the, cannibalization, of, the, sacrificial, victims, depicted, for, example, in, codex, magliabechiano, harner, claimed, that, very, high, population, pressure, and, an, emphasis, on, maize, agriculture, without, domesticated, herbivores, led, to, a, deficiency, of, essential, amino, acids, among, the, aztecs, while, there, is, universal, agreement, that, the, aztecs, practiced, sacrifice, there, is, a, lack, of, scholarly, consensus, as, to, whether, cannibalism, was, widespread, harris, the, author, of, cannibals, and, kings, 1977, has, propagated, the, claim, originally, proposed, by, harner, that, the, flesh, of, the, victims, was, a, part, of, an, aristocratic, diet, as, a, reward, since, the, aztec, diet, was, lacking, in, proteins, these, claims, have, been, refuted, by, bernard, ort, z, montellano, who, in, his, studies, of, aztec, health, diet, and, medicine, demonstrates, that, while, the, aztec, diet, was, low, in, animal, proteins, it, was, rich, in, vegetable, proteins, ortiz, also, points, to, the, preponderance, of, human, sacrifice, during, periods, of, food, abundance, following, harvests, compared, to, periods, of, food, scarcity, the, insignificant, quantity, of, human, protein, available, from, sacrifices, and, the, fact, that, aristocrats, already, had, easy, access, to, animal, protein, today, many, scholars, point, to, ideological, explanations, of, the, practice, noting, how, the, public, spectacle, of, sacrificing, warriors, from, conquered, states, was, a, major, display, of, political, power, supporting, the, claim, of, the, ruling, classes, to, divine, authority, it, also, served, as, an, important, deterrent, against, rebellion, by, subjugated, polities, against, the, aztec, state, and, such, deterrents, were, crucial, for, the, loosely, organized, empire, to, cohere, the, aztecs, greatly, appreciated, the, toltecayotl, arts, and, fine, craftsmanship, of, the, toltecs, who, predated, the, aztecs, in, central, mexico, the, aztecs, considered, toltec, productions, to, represent, the, finest, state, of, culture, the, fine, arts, included, writing, and, painting, singing, and, composing, poetry, carving, sculptures, and, producing, mosaics, making, fine, ceramics, producing, complex, featherwork, and, working, metals, including, copper, and, gold, artisans, of, the, fine, arts, were, referred, to, collectively, as, tolteca, toltec, the, aztecs, did, not, have, a, fully, developed, writing, system, like, the, maya, however, like, the, maya, and, zapotec, they, did, use, a, writing, system, that, combined, logographic, signs, with, phonetic, syllable, signs, logograms, would, for, example, be, the, use, of, an, image, of, a, mountain, to, signify, the, word, tepetl, mountain, whereas, a, phonetic, syllable, sign, would, be, the, use, of, an, image, of, a, tooth, tlantli, to, signify, the, syllable, tla, in, words, unrelated, to, teeth, the, combination, of, these, principles, allowed, the, aztecs, to, represent, the, sounds, of, names, of, persons, and, places, narratives, tended, to, be, represented, through, sequences, of, images, using, various, iconographic, conventions, such, as, footprints, to, show, paths, temples, on, fire, to, show, conquest, events, etc, epigrapher, alfonso, lacadena, has, demonstrated, that, the, different, syllable, signs, used, by, the, aztecs, almost, enabled, the, representation, of, all, the, most, frequent, syllables, of, the, nahuatl, language, with, some, notable, exceptions, but, some, scholars, have, argued, that, such, a, high, degree, of, phonetics, was, only, achieved, after, the, conquest, when, the, aztecs, had, been, introduced, to, the, principles, of, phonetic, writing, by, the, spanish, other, scholars, notably, gordon, whittaker, have, argued, that, the, syllabic, and, phonetic, aspects, of, aztec, writing, were, considerably, less, systematic, and, more, creative, than, lacadena, s, proposal, suggests, arguing, that, aztec, writing, never, coalesced, into, a, strictly, syllabic, system, such, as, the, maya, writing, but, rather, used, a, wide, range, of, different, types, of, phonetic, signs, the, image, to, the, right, demonstrates, the, use, of, phonetic, signs, for, writing, place, names, in, the, colonial, aztec, codex, mendoza, the, uppermost, place, is, mapachtepec, meaning, literally, hill, of, the, raccoon, but, the, glyph, includes, the, phonetic, prefixes, ma, hand, and, pach, moss, over, a, mountain, tepetl, spelling, the, word, mapach, raccoon, phonetically, instead, of, logographically, the, other, two, place, names, mazatlan, place, of, many, deer, and, huitztlan, place, of, many, thorns, use, the, phonetic, element, tlan, represented, by, a, tooth, tlantli, combined, with, a, deer, head, to, spell, maza, mazatl, deer, and, a, thorn, huitztli, to, spell, huitz, song, and, poetry, were, highly, regarded, there, were, presentations, and, poetry, contests, at, most, of, the, aztec, festivals, there, were, also, dramatic, presentations, that, included, players, musicians, and, acrobats, there, were, several, different, genres, of, cuicatl, song, yaocuicatl, was, devoted, to, war, and, the, god, s, of, war, teocuicatl, to, the, gods, and, creation, myths, and, adoration, of, said, figures, xochicuicatl, to, flowers, a, symbol, of, poetry, itself, and, indicative, of, the, highly, metaphorical, nature, of, poetry, that, often, used, duality, to, convey, multiple, layers, of, meaning, prose, was, tlahtolli, also, with, its, different, categories, and, divisions, a, key, aspect, of, aztec, poetics, was, the, use, of, parallelism, using, a, structure, of, embedded, couplets, to, express, different, perspectives, on, the, same, element, some, such, couplets, were, diphrasisms, conventional, metaphors, whereby, an, abstract, concept, was, expressed, metaphorically, by, using, two, more, concrete, concepts, for, example, the, nahuatl, expression, for, poetry, was, in, xochitl, in, cuicatl, a, dual, term, meaning, the, flower, the, song, a, remarkable, amount, of, this, poetry, survives, having, been, collected, during, the, era, of, the, conquest, in, some, cases, poetry, is, attributed, to, individual, authors, such, as, nezahualcoyotl, tlatoani, of, texcoco, and, cuacuauhtzin, lord, of, tepechpan, but, whether, these, attributions, reflect, actual, authorship, is, a, matter, of, opinion, an, important, collection, of, such, poems, is, romances, de, los, se, ores, de, la, nueva, espa, a, collected, tezcoco, 1582, probably, by, juan, bautista, de, pomar, and, the, cantares, mexicanos, both, men, and, women, were, poets, in, aztec, society, illustrating, pre, hispanic, mexico, s, gender, parallelism, in, upper, class, society, one, famous, female, poet, is, macuilxochitzin, whose, work, primarily, focused, on, the, aztec, conquest, the, aztecs, produced, ceramics, of, different, types, common, are, orange, wares, which, are, orange, or, buff, burnished, ceramics, with, no, slip, red, wares, are, ceramics, with, a, reddish, slip, polychrome, ware, is, ceramics, with, a, white, or, orange, slip, with, painted, designs, in, orange, red, brown, and, or, black, very, common, is, black, on, orange, ware, which, is, orange, ware, decorated, with, painted, designs, in, black, aztec, black, on, orange, ceramics, are, chronologically, classified, into, four, phases, aztec, i, and, ii, corresponding, to, c, 1100, 1350, early, aztec, period, aztec, iii, c, 1350, 1520, and, the, last, phase, aztec, iv, was, the, early, colonial, period, aztec, i, is, characterized, by, floral, designs, and, day, name, glyphs, aztec, ii, is, characterized, by, a, stylized, grass, design, above, calligraphic, designs, such, as, s, curves, or, loops, aztec, iii, is, characterized, by, very, simple, line, designs, aztec, iv, continues, some, pre, columbian, designs, but, adds, european, influenced, floral, designs, there, were, local, variations, on, each, of, these, styles, and, archeologists, continue, to, refine, the, ceramic, sequence, typical, vessels, for, everyday, use, were, clay, griddles, for, cooking, comalli, bowls, and, plates, for, eating, caxitl, pots, for, cooking, comitl, molcajetes, or, mortar, type, vessels, with, slashed, bases, for, grinding, chilli, molcaxitl, and, different, kinds, of, braziers, tripod, dishes, and, biconical, goblets, vessels, were, fired, in, simple, updraft, kilns, or, even, in, open, firing, in, pit, kilns, at, low, temperatures, polychrome, ceramics, were, imported, from, the, cholula, region, also, known, as, mixteca, puebla, style, and, these, wares, were, highly, prized, as, a, luxury, ware, whereas, the, local, black, on, orange, styles, were, also, for, everyday, use, aztec, painted, art, was, produced, on, animal, skin, mostly, deer, on, cotton, lienzos, and, amate, paper, made, from, bark, e, g, from, trema, micrantha, or, ficus, aurea, it, was, also, produced, on, ceramics, and, carved, in, wood, and, stone, the, surface, of, the, material, was, often, first, treated, with, gesso, to, make, the, images, stand, out, more, clearly, the, art, of, painting, and, writing, was, known, in, nahuatl, by, the, metaphor, in, tlilli, in, tlapalli, meaning, the, black, ink, the, red, pigment, there, are, few, extant, aztec, painted, books, of, these, none, are, conclusively, confirmed, to, have, been, created, before, the, conquest, but, several, codices, must, have, been, painted, either, right, before, the, conquest, or, very, soon, after, before, traditions, for, producing, them, were, much, disturbed, even, if, some, codices, may, have, been, produced, after, the, conquest, there, is, good, reason, to, think, that, they, may, have, been, copied, from, pre, columbian, originals, by, scribes, the, codex, borbonicus, is, considered, by, some, to, be, the, only, extant, aztec, codex, produced, before, the, conquest, it, is, a, calendric, codex, describing, the, day, and, month, counts, indicating, the, patron, deities, of, the, different, periods, others, consider, it, to, have, stylistic, traits, suggesting, a, post, conquest, production, some, codices, were, produced, post, conquest, sometimes, commissioned, by, the, colonial, government, for, example, codex, mendoza, were, painted, by, aztec, tlacuilos, codex, creators, but, under, the, control, of, spanish, authorities, who, also, sometimes, commissioned, codices, describing, pre, colonial, religious, practices, for, example, codex, r, os, after, the, conquest, codices, with, calendric, or, religious, information, were, sought, out, and, systematically, destroyed, by, the, church, whereas, other, types, of, painted, books, particularly, historical, narratives, and, tax, lists, continued, to, be, produced, although, depicting, aztec, deities, and, describing, religious, practices, also, shared, by, the, aztecs, of, the, valley, of, mexico, the, codices, produced, in, southern, puebla, near, cholula, are, sometimes, not, considered, to, be, aztec, codices, because, they, were, produced, outside, of, the, aztec, heartland, karl, anton, nowotny, nevertheless, considered, that, the, codex, borgia, painted, in, the, area, around, cholula, and, using, a, mixtec, style, was, the, most, significant, work, of, art, among, the, extant, manuscripts, the, first, aztec, murals, were, from, teotihuacan, most, of, our, current, aztec, murals, were, found, in, templo, mayor, the, aztec, capital, was, decorated, with, elaborate, murals, in, aztec, murals, humans, are, represented, like, they, are, represented, in, the, codices, one, mural, discovered, in, tlateloco, depicts, an, old, man, and, an, old, woman, this, may, represent, the, gods, cipactonal, and, oxomico, sculptures, were, carved, in, stone, and, wood, but, few, wood, carvings, have, survived, aztec, stone, sculptures, exist, in, many, sizes, from, small, figurines, and, masks, to, large, monuments, and, are, characterized, by, a, high, quality, of, craftsmanship, many, sculptures, were, carved, in, highly, realistic, styles, for, example, realistic, sculpture, of, animals, such, as, rattlesnakes, dogs, jaguars, frogs, turtles, and, monkeys, in, aztec, artwork, some, monumental, stone, sculptures, have, been, preserved, such, sculptures, usually, functioned, as, adornments, for, religious, architecture, particularly, famous, monumental, rock, sculpture, includes, the, so, called, aztec, sunstone, or, calendarstone, discovered, in, 1790, also, discovered, in, 1790, excavations, of, the, z, calo, was, the, 2, 7, meter, tall, 8, 9, ft, coatlicue, statue, made, of, andesite, representing, a, serpentine, chthonic, goddess, with, a, skirt, made, of, rattlesnakes, the, coyolxauhqui, stone, representing, the, dismembered, goddess, coyolxauhqui, found, in, 1978, was, at, the, foot, of, the, staircase, leading, up, to, the, great, temple, in, tenochtitlan, two, important, types, of, sculpture, are, unique, to, the, aztecs, and, related, to, the, context, of, ritual, sacrifice, the, cuauhxicalli, or, eagle, vessel, large, stone, bowls, often, shaped, like, eagles, or, jaguars, used, as, a, receptacle, for, extracted, human, hearts, the, temalacatl, a, monumental, carved, stone, disk, to, which, war, captives, were, tied, and, sacrificed, in, a, form, of, gladiatorial, combat, the, most, well, known, examples, of, this, type, of, sculpture, are, the, stone, of, tizoc, and, the, stone, of, motecuzoma, i, both, carved, with, images, of, warfare, and, conquest, by, specific, aztec, rulers, many, smaller, stone, sculptures, depicting, deities, also, exist, the, style, used, in, religious, sculpture, was, rigid, stances, likely, meant, to, create, a, powerful, experience, for, the, onlooker, although, aztec, stone, sculptures, are, now, displayed, in, museums, as, unadorned, rock, they, were, originally, painted, in, vivid, polychrome, color, sometimes, covered, first, with, a, base, coat, of, plaster, early, spanish, conquistador, accounts, also, describe, stone, sculptures, as, having, been, decorated, with, precious, stones, and, metal, inserted, into, the, plaster, an, especially, prized, art, form, among, the, aztecs, was, featherwork, the, creation, of, intricate, and, colorful, mosaics, of, feathers, and, their, use, in, garments, as, well, as, decoration, on, weaponry, war, banners, and, warrior, suits, the, class, of, highly, skilled, and, honored, craftsmen, who, created, feather, objects, was, called, the, amanteca, named, after, the, amantla, neighborhood, in, tenochtitlan, where, they, lived, and, worked, they, did, not, pay, taxes, nor, were, required, to, perform, public, service, the, florentine, codex, gives, information, about, how, feather, works, were, created, the, amanteca, had, two, ways, of, creating, their, works, one, was, to, secure, the, feathers, in, place, using, agave, cords, for, three, dimensional, objects, such, as, fly, whisks, fans, bracelets, headgear, and, other, objects, the, second, and, more, difficult, was, a, mosaic, type, technique, which, the, spanish, also, called, feather, painting, these, were, done, principally, on, feather, shields, and, cloaks, for, idols, feather, mosaics, were, arrangements, of, minute, fragments, of, feathers, from, a, wide, variety, of, birds, generally, worked, on, a, paper, base, made, from, cotton, and, paste, then, itself, backed, with, amate, paper, but, bases, of, other, types, of, paper, and, directly, on, amate, were, done, as, well, these, works, were, done, in, layers, with, common, feathers, dyed, feathers, and, precious, feathers, first, a, model, was, made, with, lower, quality, feathers, and, the, precious, feathers, were, found, only, on, the, top, layer, the, adhesive, for, the, feathers, in, the, mesoamerican, period, was, made, from, orchid, bulbs, feathers, from, local, and, faraway, sources, were, used, especially, in, the, aztec, empire, the, feathers, were, obtained, from, wild, birds, as, well, as, from, domesticated, turkeys, and, ducks, with, the, finest, quetzal, feathers, coming, from, chiapas, guatemala, and, honduras, these, feathers, were, obtained, through, trade, and, taxes, due, to, the, difficulty, of, conserving, feathers, fewer, than, ten, pieces, of, original, aztec, featherwork, exist, today, mexico, city, was, built, on, the, ruins, of, tenochtitlan, gradually, replacing, and, covering, the, lake, the, island, and, the, architecture, of, aztec, tenochtitlan, after, the, fall, of, tenochtitlan, aztec, warriors, were, enlisted, as, auxiliary, troops, alongside, the, spanish, tlaxcalteca, allies, and, aztec, forces, participated, in, all, of, the, subsequent, campaigns, of, conquest, in, northern, and, southern, mesoamerica, this, meant, that, aspects, of, aztec, culture, and, the, nahuatl, language, continued, to, expand, during, the, early, colonial, period, as, aztec, auxiliary, forces, made, permanent, settlements, in, many, of, the, areas, that, were, put, under, the, spanish, crown, the, aztec, ruling, dynasty, continued, to, govern, the, indigenous, polity, of, san, juan, tenochtitlan, a, division, of, the, spanish, capital, of, mexico, city, but, the, subsequent, indigenous, rulers, were, mostly, puppets, installed, by, the, spanish, one, was, andr, s, de, tapia, motelchiuh, who, was, appointed, by, the, spanish, other, former, aztec, city, states, likewise, were, established, as, colonial, indigenous, towns, governed, by, a, local, indigenous, gobernador, this, office, was, often, initially, held, by, the, hereditary, indigenous, ruling, line, with, the, gobernador, being, the, tlatoani, but, the, two, positions, in, many, nahua, towns, became, separated, over, time, indigenous, governors, were, in, charge, of, the, colonial, political, organization, of, the, indians, in, particular, they, enabled, the, continued, functioning, of, the, tax, and, enslavement, of, indigenous, commoners, to, benefit, the, spanish, encomenderos, encomenderos, owned, encomiendas, large, tracts, of, agricultural, land, on, which, the, encomenderos, and, their, slaves, lived, the, spanish, coerced, the, tribes, into, granting, them, private, ownership, of, indigenous, people, and, land, for, enslavement, and, encomiendas, occasionally, an, indigenous, individual, benefited, from, this, system, and, grew, into, substantial, wealth, and, power, come, the, colonial, period, after, the, arrival, of, the, europeans, in, mexico, and, the, conquest, indigenous, populations, declined, significantly, this, was, largely, the, result, of, the, epidemics, of, viruses, brought, to, the, continent, against, which, the, natives, had, no, immunity, in, 1520, 1521, an, outbreak, of, smallpox, swept, through, the, population, of, tenochtitlan, and, was, decisive, in, the, fall, of, the, city, further, significant, epidemics, struck, in, 1545, and, 1576, there, has, been, no, consensus, about, the, population, size, of, mexico, at, the, time, of, european, arrival, early, estimates, gave, very, small, population, figures, for, the, valley, of, mexico, in, 1942, kubler, estimated, a, figure, of, 200, 000, in, 1963, borah, and, cook, used, preconquest, tax, lists, to, calculate, the, number, of, residents, in, central, mexico, estimating, over, 18, 30, million, their, very, high, figure, has, been, highly, criticized, for, relying, on, unwarranted, assumptions, archeologist, william, sanders, based, an, estimate, on, archeological, evidence, of, dwellings, arriving, at, an, estimate, of, 1, 1, 2, million, inhabitants, in, the, valley, of, mexico, whitmore, used, a, computer, simulation, model, based, on, colonial, censuses, to, arrive, at, an, estimate, of, 1, 5, million, for, the, basin, in, 1519, and, an, estimate, of, 16, million, for, all, of, mexico, depending, on, the, estimations, of, the, population, in, 1519, the, scale, of, the, decline, in, the, 16th, century, range, from, around, 50, percent, to, around, 90, percent, with, sanders, s, and, whitmore, s, estimates, being, around, 90, percent, although, the, aztec, empire, fell, some, of, its, highest, elites, continued, to, hold, elite, status, in, the, colonial, era, the, principal, heirs, of, moctezuma, ii, and, their, descendants, retained, high, status, his, son, pedro, moctezuma, produced, a, son, who, married, into, the, spanish, aristocracy, and, a, further, generation, saw, the, creation, of, the, title, duke, of, moctezuma, de, tultengo, from, 1696, to, 1701, the, viceroy, of, mexico, held, the, title, of, count, of, moctezuma, in, 1766, the, holder, of, the, title, became, a, grandee, of, spain, in, 1865, during, the, second, mexican, empire, the, title, which, was, held, by, antonio, mar, a, moctezuma, marcilla, de, teruel, y, navarro, 14th, count, of, moctezuma, de, tultengo, was, elevated, to, that, of, a, duke, thus, becoming, duke, of, moctezuma, with, de, tultengo, again, added, in, 1992, by, juan, carlos, i, two, of, moctezuma, s, daughters, do, a, isabel, moctezuma, and, her, younger, sister, do, a, leonor, moctezuma, were, granted, extensive, encomiendas, in, perpetuity, by, hern, n, cortes, do, a, leonor, moctezuma, married, in, succession, two, spaniards, and, left, her, encomiendas, to, her, daughter, by, her, second, husband, the, different, nahua, peoples, just, like, other, mesoamerican, indigenous, peoples, in, colonial, new, spain, were, able, to, maintain, many, aspects, of, their, social, and, political, structure, under, colonial, rule, the, basic, division, the, spanish, made, was, between, the, indigenous, populations, organized, under, the, rep, blica, de, indios, which, was, separate, from, the, hispanic, sphere, the, rep, blica, de, espa, oles, the, rep, blica, de, espa, oles, included, not, just, europeans, but, also, africans, and, mixed, race, castas, the, spanish, recognized, the, indigenous, elites, as, nobles, in, the, spanish, colonial, system, maintaining, the, status, distinction, of, the, preconquest, era, and, used, these, noblemen, as, intermediaries, between, the, spanish, colonial, government, and, their, communities, this, was, contingent, on, their, conversion, to, christianity, and, continuing, loyalty, to, the, spanish, crown, colonial, nahua, polities, had, considerable, autonomy, to, regulate, their, local, affairs, the, spanish, rulers, did, not, entirely, understand, the, indigenous, political, organization, but, they, recognized, the, importance, of, the, existing, system, and, their, elite, rulers, they, reshaped, the, political, system, utilizing, altepetl, or, city, states, as, the, basic, unit, of, governance, in, the, colonial, era, altepetl, was, renamed, cabeceras, or, head, towns, although, they, often, retained, the, term, altepetl, in, local, level, nahuatl, language, documentation, with, outlying, settlements, governed, by, the, cabeceras, named, sujetos, subject, communities, in, cabeceras, the, spanish, created, iberian, style, town, councils, or, cabildos, which, usually, continued, to, function, as, the, elite, ruling, group, had, in, the, preconquest, era, population, decline, due, to, epidemic, disease, resulted, in, many, population, shifts, in, settlement, patterns, and, the, formation, of, new, population, centers, these, were, often, forced, resettlements, under, the, spanish, policy, of, congregaci, n, indigenous, populations, living, in, sparsely, populated, areas, were, resettled, to, form, new, communities, making, it, easier, for, them, to, be, brought, within, range, of, evangelization, efforts, and, easier, for, the, colonial, state, to, exploit, their, labor, today, the, legacy, of, the, aztecs, lives, on, in, mexico, in, many, forms, archeological, sites, are, excavated, and, opened, to, the, public, and, their, artifacts, are, prominently, displayed, in, museums, place, names, and, loanwords, from, the, aztec, language, nahuatl, permeate, the, mexican, landscape, and, vocabulary, and, aztec, symbols, and, mythology, have, been, promoted, by, the, mexican, government, and, integrated, into, contemporary, mexican, nationalism, as, emblems, of, the, country, during, the, 19th, century, the, image, of, the, aztecs, as, uncivilized, barbarians, was, replaced, with, romanticized, visions, of, the, aztecs, as, original, sons, of, the, soil, with, a, highly, developed, culture, rivaling, the, ancient, european, civilizations, when, mexico, became, independent, from, spain, a, romanticized, version, of, the, aztecs, became, a, source, of, images, that, could, be, used, to, ground, the, new, nation, as, a, unique, blend, of, european, and, american, aztec, culture, and, history, have, been, central, to, the, formation, of, a, mexican, national, identity, after, mexican, independence, in, 1821, in, 17th, and, 18th, century, europe, the, aztecs, were, generally, described, as, barbaric, gruesome, and, culturally, inferior, even, before, mexico, achieved, its, independence, american, born, spaniards, criollos, drew, on, aztec, history, to, ground, their, search, for, symbols, of, local, pride, separate, from, that, of, spain, intellectuals, used, aztec, writings, such, as, those, collected, by, fernando, de, alva, ixtlilxochitl, and, writings, of, hernando, alvarado, tezozomoc, and, chimalpahin, to, understand, mexico, s, indigenous, past, in, texts, by, indigenous, writers, this, search, became, the, basis, for, what, historian, d, a, brading, calls, creole, patriotism, seventeenth, century, cleric, and, scientist, carlos, de, sig, enza, y, g, ngora, acquired, the, manuscript, collection, of, texcocan, nobleman, alva, ixtlilxochitl, creole, jesuit, francisco, javier, clavijero, published, la, historia, antigua, de, m, xico, 1780, 1781, in, his, italian, exile, following, the, expulsion, of, the, jesuits, in, 1767, in, which, he, traces, the, history, of, the, aztecs, from, their, migration, to, the, last, aztec, ruler, cuauhtemoc, he, wrote, it, expressly, to, defend, mexico, s, indigenous, past, against, the, slanders, of, contemporary, writers, such, as, pauw, buffon, raynal, and, william, robertson, archeological, excavations, in, 1790, in, the, capital, s, main, square, uncovered, two, massive, stone, sculptures, buried, immediately, after, the, fall, of, tenochtitlan, in, the, conquest, unearthed, were, the, famous, calendar, stone, as,

of, the, cordilleras, and, monuments, of, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, humboldt, was, important, in, disseminating, images, of, the, aztecs, to, scientists, and, general, readers, in, the, western, world, in, the, realm, of, religion, late, colonial, paintings, of, the, virgin, of, guadalupe, have, examples, of, her, depicted, floating, above, the, iconic, nopal, cactus, of, the, aztecs, juan, diego, the, nahua, to, whom, the, apparition, was, said, to, appear, links, the, dark, virgin, to, mexico, s, aztec, past, when, new, spain, achieved, independence, in, 1821, and, became, a, monarchy, the, first, mexican, empire, its, flag, had, the, traditional, aztec, eagle, on, a, nopal, cactus, the, eagle, had, a, crown, symbolizing, the, new, mexican, monarchy, when, mexico, became, a, republic, after, the, overthrow, of, the, first, monarch, agust, n, de, iturbide, in, 1822, the, flag, was, revised, to, show, the, eagle, with, no, crown, in, the, 1860s, when, the, french, established, the, second, mexican, empire, under, maximilian, of, habsburg, the, mexican, flag, retained, the, emblematic, eagle, and, cactus, with, elaborate, symbols, of, monarchy, after, the, defeat, of, the, french, and, their, mexican, collaborators, the, mexican, republic, was, re, established, and, the, flag, returned, to, its, republican, simplicity, this, emblem, has, also, been, adopted, as, mexico, s, national, coat, of, arms, and, is, emblazoned, on, official, buildings, seals, and, signs, tensions, within, post, independence, mexico, pitted, those, rejecting, the, ancient, civilizations, of, mexico, as, a, source, of, national, pride, the, hispanistas, mostly, politically, conservative, mexican, elites, and, those, who, saw, them, as, a, source, of, pride, the, indigenistas, who, were, mostly, liberal, mexican, elites, although, the, flag, of, the, mexican, republic, had, the, symbol, of, the, aztecs, as, its, central, element, conservative, elites, were, generally, hostile, to, the, current, indigenous, populations, of, mexico, or, crediting, them, with, a, glorious, pre, hispanic, history, under, mexican, president, antonio, l, pez, de, santa, anna, pro, indigenist, mexican, intellectuals, did, not, find, a, wide, audience, with, santa, anna, s, overthrow, in, 1854, mexican, liberals, and, scholars, interested, in, the, indigenous, past, became, more, active, liberals, were, more, favorably, inclined, toward, the, indigenous, populations, and, their, history, but, considered, a, pressing, matter, being, the, indian, problem, liberals, commitment, to, equality, before, the, law, meant, that, for, upwardly, mobile, indigenous, such, as, zapotec, benito, ju, rez, who, rose, in, the, ranks, of, the, liberals, to, become, mexico, s, first, president, of, indigenous, origins, and, nahua, intellectual, and, politician, ignacio, altamirano, a, disciple, of, ignacio, ram, rez, a, defender, of, the, rights, of, the, indigenous, liberalism, presented, a, way, forward, in, that, era, for, investigations, of, mexico, s, indigenous, past, however, the, role, of, moderate, liberal, jos, fernando, ram, rez, is, important, serving, as, director, of, the, national, museum, and, doing, research, utilizing, codices, while, staying, out, of, the, fierce, conflicts, between, liberals, and, conservatives, that, led, to, a, decade, of, civil, war, mexican, scholars, who, pursued, research, on, the, aztecs, in, the, late, 19th, century, were, francisco, pimentel, antonio, garc, a, cubas, manuel, orozco, y, berra, joaqu, n, garc, a, icazbalceta, and, francisco, del, paso, y, troncoso, contributing, significantly, to, the, 19th, century, development, of, mexican, scholarship, on, the, aztecs, the, late, 19th, century, in, mexico, was, a, period, in, which, aztec, civilization, became, a, point, of, national, pride, the, era, was, dominated, by, liberal, military, hero, porfirio, d, az, a, mestizo, from, oaxaca, who, was, president, of, mexico, from, 1876, to, 1911, his, policies, opening, mexico, to, foreign, investors, and, modernizing, the, country, under, a, firm, hand, controlling, unrest, order, and, progress, undermined, mexico, s, indigenous, populations, and, their, communities, however, for, investigations, of, mexico, s, ancient, civilizations, his, was, a, benevolent, regime, with, funds, supporting, archeological, research, and, for, protecting, monuments, scholars, found, it, more, profitable, to, confine, their, attention, to, indians, who, had, been, dead, for, a, number, of, centuries, his, benevolence, saw, the, placement, of, a, monument, to, cuauhtemoc, in, a, major, traffic, roundabout, glorieta, of, the, wide, paseo, de, la, reforma, which, he, inaugurated, in, 1887, in, world, fairs, of, the, late, 19th, century, mexico, s, pavilions, included, a, major, focus, on, its, indigenous, past, especially, the, aztecs, mexican, scholars, such, as, alfredo, chavero, helped, shape, the, cultural, image, of, mexico, at, these, exhibitions, the, mexican, revolution, 1910, 1920, and, the, significant, participation, of, indigenous, people, in, the, struggle, in, many, regions, ignited, a, broad, government, sponsored, political, and, cultural, movement, of, indigenismo, with, symbols, of, mexico, s, aztec, past, becoming, ubiquitous, most, especially, in, mexican, muralism, of, diego, rivera, in, their, works, mexican, authors, such, as, octavio, paz, and, agustin, fuentes, have, analyzed, the, use, of, aztec, symbols, by, the, modern, mexican, state, critiquing, the, way, it, adopts, and, adapts, indigenous, culture, to, political, ends, yet, they, have, also, in, their, works, made, use, of, the, symbolic, idiom, themselves, paz, for, example, critiqued, the, architectural, layout, of, the, national, museum, of, anthropology, which, constructs, a, view, of, mexican, history, as, culminating, with, the, aztecs, as, an, expression, of, a, nationalist, appropriation, of, aztec, culture, scholars, in, europe, and, the, united, states, increasingly, wanted, investigations, into, mexico, s, ancient, civilizations, starting, in, the, nineteenth, century, humboldt, had, been, extremely, important, in, bringing, ancient, mexico, into, broader, scholarly, discussions, of, ancient, civilizations, french, americanist, charles, tienne, brasseur, de, bourbourg, 1814, 1874, asserted, that, science, in, our, own, time, has, at, last, effectively, studied, and, rehabilitated, america, and, the, americans, from, the, viewpoint, of, history, and, archeology, it, was, humboldt, who, woke, us, from, our, sleep, frenchman, jean, fr, d, ric, waldeck, published, voyage, pittoresque, et, arch, ologique, dans, la, province, d, yucatan, pendant, les, ann, es, 1834, et, 1836, in, 1838, although, not, directly, connected, with, the, aztecs, it, contributed, to, the, increased, interest, in, ancient, mexican, studies, in, europe, english, aristocrat, lord, kingsborough, spent, considerable, energy, in, their, pursuit, of, understanding, ancient, mexico, kingsborough, answered, humboldt, s, call, for, the, publication, of, all, known, mexican, codices, publishing, nine, volumes, of, antiquities, of, mexico, 1831, 1846, that, were, richly, illustrated, bankrupting, him, he, was, not, directly, interested, in, the, aztecs, but, rather, in, proving, that, mexico, had, been, colonized, by, jews, however, his, publication, of, these, valuable, primary, sources, gave, others, access, to, them, in, the, united, states, in, the, early, 19th, century, interest, in, ancient, mexico, propelled, john, lloyd, stephens, to, travel, to, mexico, and, then, publish, well, illustrated, accounts, in, the, early, 1840s, the, research, of, a, half, blind, bostonian, william, hickling, prescott, into, the, spanish, conquest, of, mexico, resulted, in, his, highly, popular, and, deeply, researched, the, conquest, of, mexico, 1843, although, not, formally, trained, as, a, historian, prescott, drew, on, the, obvious, spanish, sources, but, also, ixtlilxochitl, and, sahag, n, s, history, of, the, conquest, his, resulting, work, was, a, mixture, of, pro, and, anti, aztec, attitudes, it, was, not, only, a, bestseller, in, english, but, it, also, influenced, mexican, intellectuals, including, the, leading, conservative, politician, lucas, alam,

devoted, to, ancient, mexico, half, of, which, concerned, the, aztecs, it, was, a, work, of, synthesis, drawing, on, ixtlilxochitl, and, brasseur, de, bourbourg, among, others, when, the, international, congress, of, americanists, was, formed, in, nancy, france, in, 1875, mexican, scholars, became, active, participants, and, mexico, city, hosted, the, biennial, multidisciplinary,
