culminated, in, the, establishment, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, in, 1569, one, of, europe, s, great, powers, the, commonwealth, was, able, to, sustain, centuries, long, prosperity, while, its, political, system, matured, as, a, unique, noble, democracy, with, an, elective, monarchy, from, the, mid, 17th, century, however, the, huge, state, entered, a, period, of, decline, caused, by, devastating, wars, and, the, deterioration, of, its, political, system, significant, internal, reforms, were, introduced, in, the, late, 18th, century, such, as, europe, s, first, constitution, of, 3, may, 1791, the, existence, of, the, commonwealth, ended, in, 1795, after, a, series, of, invasions, and, partitions, carried, out, by, the, russian, empire, the, kingdom, of,

contributed, to, a, peaceful, transition, from, a, planned, communist, economy, to, capitalism, and, a, liberal, parliamentary, democracy, this, process, resulted, in, the, creation, of, the, modern, polish, state, the, third, polish, republic, founded, in, 1989, in, prehistoric, and, protohistoric, times, over, a, period, of, approximately, 500, 000, years, the, area, of, present, day, poland, was, intermittently, inhabited, by, members, of, the, genus, homo, the, earliest, evidence, of, homo, erectus, activity, in, the, form, of, microlith, artifacts, was, discovered, at, trzebnica, in, lower, silesia, it, remains, the, oldest, archeological, site, in, the, country, dating, back, to, the, lower, paleolithic, period, of, the, stone, age, the, southern, regions, of, poland, were, subsequently, penetrated, by, sporadic, groups, of, neanderthals, their, presence, was, confirmed, by, the, stone, tools, unearthed, in, caves, of, the, krak, w, cz, stochowa, upland, a, limestone, formation, with, hills, cliffs, and, valleys, that, came, to, be, known, as, the, polish, jura, the, arrival, of, homo, sapiens, and, anatomically, modern, humans, coincided, with, the, climatic, discontinuity, at, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, weichselian, glaciation, around, 10, 000, bc, when, poland, became, warmer, and, habitable, it, allowed, various, groups, of, early, humans, to, pass, the, sudeten, mountains, through, the, moravian, gate, and, the, k, odzko, valley, into, lower, silesia, the, neolithic, period, ushered, in, the, linear, pottery, culture, whose, founders, belonged, to, the, danubian, culture, and, migrated, from, the, danube, river, area, beginning, about, 5500, bc, this, culture, was, distinguished, by, the, establishment, of, the, first, settled, agricultural, communities, in, modern, polish, territory, later, between, about, 4400, and, 2000, bc, the, native, post, mesolithic, populations, would, also, adopt, and, further, develop, the, agricultural, way, of, life, excavations, indicated, broad, ranging, development, in, the, new, stone, age, most, notably, the, oldest, samples, of, european, cheese, 5500, bc, were, found, in, the, region, of, kuyavia, and, a, pot, from, bronocice, is, incised, with, what, is, now, believed, to, be, the, earliest, known, portrayal, of, a, wheeled, vehicle, 3400, bc, toolmaking, became, more, advanced, and, material, was, primarily, sourced, from, quarries, and, mines, in, the, wi, tokrzyskie, holy, cross, mountains, artifacts, that, originated, in, this, mountain, region, were, excavated, as, far, as, moravia, and, near, the, baltic, sea, it, is, estimated, that, the, unesco, protected, neolithic, flint, mines, at, krzemionki, one, of, europe, s, largest, were, utilised, by, the, funnelbeaker, and, globular, amphora, cultures, from, 3900, bc, to, 1600, bc, the, only, surviving, example, of, ancient, parietal, art, in, poland, is, at, a, flint, shaft, in, krzemionki, and,

the, celts, and, then, by, the, roman, empire, the, germanic, peoples, migrated, out, of, the, area, by, about, 500, ad, during, the, great, migration, period, of, the, european, dark, ages, wooded, regions, to, the, north, and, east, were, settled, by, balts, according, to, some, archaeological, research, slavs, have, resided, in, modern, polish, territories, for, only, 1, 500, years, however, recent, genetic, studies, determined, that, the, inhabitants, of, poland, are, also, the, descendants, of, people, from, before, the, migration, period, according, to, other, archaeological, and, linguistic, research, early, slavic, peoples, were, likely, present, in, parts, of, poland, much, earlier, and, may, have, been, associated, with, the, ancient, przeworsk, culture, of, the, 3rd, century, bc, though, some, slavic, groups, may, have, arrived, from, the, east, in, later, periods, the, west, slavic, and, lechitic, peoples, as, well, as, any, remaining, minority, clans, were,

year, sejm, it, first, met, in, 1788, its, landmark, achievement, was, the, passing, of, the, constitution, of, 3, may, 1791, the, first, singular, pronouncement, of, a, supreme, law, of, the, state, in, modern, europe, a, moderately, reformist, document, condemned, by, detractors, as, sympathetic, to, the, ideals, of, the, french, revolution, it, soon, generated, strong, opposition, from, the,

convinced, of, the, futility, of, resistance, capitulated, by, joining, the, targowica, confederation, the, russian, allied, confederation, took, over, the, government, but, russia, and, prussia, in, 1793, arranged, for, the, second, partition, of, poland, anyway, the, partition, left, the, country, with, a, critically, reduced, territory, that, rendered, it, essentially, incapable, of, an, independent, existence, the, commonwealth, s, grodno, sejm, of, 1793, the, last, sejm, of, the, state, s, existence, was, compelled, to, confirm, the, new, partition, radicalized, by, recent, events, polish, reformers, whether, in, exile, or, still, resident, in, the, reduced, area, remaining, to, the, commonwealth, were, soon, working, on, preparations, for, a, national, insurrection, tadeusz,

hard, fought, insurrection, despite, widespread, national, support, proved, incapable, of, generating, the, foreign, assistance, necessary, for, its, success, in, the, end, it, was, suppressed, by, the, combined, forces, of, russia, and, prussia, with, warsaw, captured, in, november, 1794, in, the, aftermath, of, the, battle, of, praga, in, 1795, a, third, partition, of, poland, was, undertaken,

1796, the, response, of, the, polish, leadership, to, the, last, partition, is, a, matter, of, historical, debate, literary, scholars, found, that, the, dominant, emotion, of, the, first, decade, was, despair, that, produced, a, moral, desert, ruled, by, violence, and, treason, on, the, other, hand, historians, have, looked, for, signs, of, resistance, to, foreign, rule, apart, from, those, who, went, into, exile, the, nobility, took, oaths, of, loyalty, to, their, new, rulers, and, served, as, officers, in, their, armies, although, no, sovereign, polish, state, existed, between, 1795, and, 1918, the, idea, of, polish, independence, was, kept, alive, throughout, the, 19th, century, there, were, a, number, of, uprisings, and, other, armed, undertakings, waged, against, the, partitioning,

the, years, 1814, and, 1815, adam, jerzy, czartoryski, a, former, close, associate, of, emperor, alexander, i, became, the, leading, advocate, for, the, polish, national, cause, the, congress, implemented, a, new, partition, scheme, which, took, into, account, some, of, the, gains, realized, by, the, poles, during, the, napoleonic, period, the, duchy, of, warsaw, was, replaced, in, 1815, with, a, new, kingdom, of, poland, unofficially, known, as, congress, poland, the, residual, polish, kingdom, was, joined, to, the, russian, empire, in, a, personal, union, under, the, russian, tsar, and, it, was, allowed, its, own, constitution, and, military, east, of, the, kingdom, large, areas, of, the, former, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, remained, directly, incorporated, into, the,

the, lands, taken, over, by, foreign, powers, because, the, period, after, the, congress, of, vienna, witnessed, a, significant, development, in, the, building, of, early, industry, economic, historians, have, made, new, estimates, on, gdp, per, capita, 1790, 1910, they, confirm, the, hypothesis, of, semi, peripheral, development, of, polish, territories, in, the, 19th, century, and, the, slow, process, of, catching, up, with, the, core, economies, the, increasingly, repressive, policies, of, the, partitioning, powers, led, to, resistance, movements, in, partitioned, poland, and, in, 1830, polish, patriots, staged, the, november, uprising, this, revolt, developed, into, a, full, scale, war, with, russia, but, the, leadership, was, taken, over, by, polish, conservatives, who, were, reluctant, to, challenge, the, empire, and, hostile, to, broadening, the, independence, movement, s, social, base, through, measures, such, as, land, reform, despite, the, significant, resources, mobilized, a, series, of, errors, by, several, successive, chief, commanders, appointed, by, the, insurgent, polish, national, government, led, to, the, defeat, of, its, forces, by, the, russian, army, in, 1831, congress, poland, lost, its, constitution, and, military, but, formally, remained, a, separate, administrative, unit, within, the, russian, empire, after, the, defeat, of, the, november, uprising, thousands, of, former, polish, combatants, and, other, activists, emigrated, to, western, europe, this, phenomenon, known, as, the, great, emigration, soon, dominated, polish,

armed, insurrection, the, planned, national, uprising, failed, to, materialize, because, the, authorities, in, the, partitions, found, out, about, secret, preparations, the, greater, poland, uprising, ended, in, a, fiasco, in, early, 1846, in, the, krak, w, uprising, of, february, 1846, patriotic, action, was, combined, with, revolutionary, demands, but, the, result, was, the, incorporation, of, the, free, city, of, cracow, into, the, austrian, partition, the, austrian, officials, took, advantage, of, peasant, discontent, and, incited, villagers, against, the, noble, dominated, insurgent, units, this, resulted, in, the, galician, slaughter, of, 1846, a, large, scale, rebellion, of, serfs, seeking, relief, from, their, post, feudal, condition, of, mandatory, labor, as, practiced, in, folwarks, the, uprising, freed, many, from, bondage, and, hastened, decisions, that, led, to, the, abolition, of, polish, serfdom, in, the, austrian, empire, in, 1848, a, new, wave, of, polish, involvement, in, revolutionary, movements, soon, took, place, in, the, partitions, and, in, other, parts, of, europe, in, the, context, of, the, spring, of, nations, revolutions, of, 1848, e, g, j,

participants, the, red, or, left, wing, faction, of, polish, activists, which, promoted, peasant, enfranchisement, and, cooperated, with, russian, revolutionaries, became, involved, in, immediate, preparations, for, a, national, uprising, the, white, or, right, wing, faction, was, inclined, to, cooperate, with, the, russian, authorities, and, countered, with, partial, reform, proposals, in, order, to, cripple, the, manpower, potential, of, the, reds, aleksander, wielopolski, the, conservative, leader, of, the, government, of, congress, poland, arranged, for, a, partial, selective, conscription, of, young, poles, for, the, russian, army, in, the, years, 1862, and, 1863, this, action, hastened, the, outbreak, of, hostilities, the, january, uprising, joined, and, led, after, the, initial, period, by, the, whites, was, fought, by, partisan, units, against, an, overwhelmingly, advantaged, enemy, the, uprising, lasted, from, january, 1863, to, the, spring, of, 1864, when, romuald, traugutt, the, last, supreme, commander, of, the, insurgency, was, captured, by, the, tsarist, police, on, 2, march, 1864, the, russian, authority, compelled, by, the, uprising, to, compete, for, the, loyalty, of, polish, peasants, officially, published, an, enfranchisement, decree, in, congress, poland, along, the, lines, of, an, earlier, land, reform, proclamation, of, the, insurgents, the, act, created, the, conditions, necessary, for, the, development, of, the, capitalist, system, on, central, polish, lands, at, the, time, when, most, poles, realized, the, futility, of, armed, resistance, without, external, support, the, various, sections, of, polish, society, were, undergoing, deep, and, far, reaching, evolution, in, the, areas, of, social, economic, and, cultural,

1919, 1921, was, the, most, important, series, of, military, actions, of, the, era, pi, sudski, had, entertained, far, reaching, anti, russian, cooperative, designs, in, eastern, europe, and, in, 1919, the, polish, forces, pushed, eastward, into, lithuania, belarus, and, ukraine, by, taking, advantage, of, the, russian, preoccupation, with, a, civil, war, but, they, were, soon, confronted, with, the, soviet, westward, offensive, of, 1918, 1919, western, ukraine, was, already, a, theater, of, the, polish, ukrainian, war, which, eliminated, the, proclaimed, west, ukrainian, people, s, republic, in, july, 1919, in, the, autumn, of, 1919, pi, sudski, rejected, urgent, pleas, from, the, former, entente, powers, to, support, anton, denikin, s, white, movement, in, its, advance, on,

soviet, army, reached, the, outskirts, of, warsaw, in, early, august, a, soviet, triumph, and, the, quick, end, of, poland, seemed, inevitable, however, the, poles, scored, a, stunning, victory, at, the, battle, of, warsaw, 1920, afterwards, more, polish, military, successes, followed, and, the, soviets, had, to, pull, back, they, left, swathes, of, territory, populated, largely, by, belarusians, or, ukrainians, to, polish, rule, the, new, eastern, boundary, was, finalized, by, the, peace, of, riga, in, march, 1921, the, defeat, of, the, russian, armies, forced, vladimir, lenin, and, the, soviet, leadership, to, postpone, their, strategic, objective, of, linking, up, with, the, german, and, other, european, revolutionary, leftist, collaborators, to, spread, communist, revolution, lenin, also, hoped, for, generating, support, for, the, red, army, in, poland, which, failed, to, materialize, pi, sudski, s, seizure, of, vilnius, in, october, 1920, known, as, eligowski, s, mutiny, was, a, nail, in, the, coffin, of, the, already, poor, lithuania, poland, relations, that, had, been, strained, by, the, polish, lithuanian, war, of, 1919, 1920, both, states, would, remain, hostile, to, one, another, for, the, remainder, of, the, interwar, period, pi, sudski, s, concept, of, intermarium, an, east, european, federation, of, states, inspired, by, the, tradition, of, the, multiethnic, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, that, would, include, a, hypothetical, multinational, successor, state, to, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, had, the, fatal, flaw, of, being, incompatible, with, his, assumption, of, polish, domination, which, would, amount, to, an, encroachment, on, the, neighboring, peoples, lands, and, aspirations, at, the, time, of, rising, national, movements, the, plan, thus, ceased, being, a, feature, of, poland, s, politics, a, larger, federated, structure, was, also, opposed, by, dmowski, s, national, democrats, their, representative, at, the, peace, of, riga, talks, stanis, aw, grabski, opted, for, leaving, minsk, berdychiv, kamianets, podilskyi, and, the, surrounding, areas, on, the, soviet, side, of, the, border, the, national, democrats, did, not, want, to, assume, the, lands, they, considered, politically, undesirable, as, such, territorial, enlargement, would, result, in, a, reduced, proportion, of, citizens, who, were, ethnically, polish, the, peace, of, riga, settled, the, eastern, border, by, preserving, for, poland, a, substantial, portion, of, the, old, commonwealth, s, eastern, territories, at, the, cost, of, partitioning, the, lands, of, the, former, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, lithuania, and, belarus, and, ukraine, the, ukrainians, ended, up, with, no, state, of, their, own, and, felt, betrayed, by, the, riga, arrangements, their, resentment, gave, rise, to, extreme, nationalism, and, anti, polish, hostility, the, kresy, or, borderland, territories, in, the, east, won, by, 1921, would, form, the, basis, for, a, swap, arranged, and, carried, out, by, the, soviets, in, 1943, 1945, who, at, that, time, compensated, the, re, emerging, polish, state, for, the, eastern, lands, lost, to, the, soviet, union, with, conquered, areas, of, eastern, germany, the, successful, outcome, of, the, polish, soviet, war, gave, poland, a, false, sense, of, its, prowess, as, a, self, sufficient, military, power, and, encouraged, the, government, to, try, to, resolve, international, problems, through, imposed, unilateral, solutions, the, territorial, and, ethnic, policies, of, the, interwar, period, contributed, to, bad, relations, with, most, of, poland, s, neighbors, and, uneasy, cooperation, with, more, distant, centers, of, power, especially, france, and, great, britain, among, the, chief, difficulties, faced, by, the, government, of, the, new, polish, republic, was, the, lack, of, an, integrated, infrastructure, among, the, formerly, separate, partitions, a, deficiency, that, disrupted, industry, transportation, trade, and, other, areas, the, first, polish, legislative, election, for, the, re, established, sejm, national, parliament, took, place, in, january, 1919, a, temporary, small, constitution, was, passed, by, the, body, the, following, month, the, rapidly, growing, population, of, poland, within, its, new, boundaries, was, three, fourths, agricultural, and, one, fourth, urban, polish, was, the, primary, language, of, only, two, thirds, of, the, inhabitants, of, the, new, country, the, minorities, had, very, little, voice, in, the, government, the, permanent, march, constitution, of, poland, was, adopted, in, march, 1921, at, the, insistence, of, the, national, democrats, who, were, concerned, about, how, aggressively, j, zef, pi, sudski, might, exercise, presidential, powers, if, he, were, elected, to, office, the, constitution, mandated, limited, prerogatives, for, the, presidency, the, proclamation, of, the, march, constitution, was, followed, by, a, short, and, turbulent, period, of, constitutional, order, and, parliamentary, democracy, that, lasted, until, 1926, the, legislature, remained, fragmented, without, stable, majorities, and, governments, changed, frequently, the, open, minded, gabriel, narutowicz, was, elected, president, according, to, the, constitution, by, the, national, assembly, in, 1922, without, popular, vote, however, members, of, the, nationalist, right, wing, faction, did, not, regard, his, elevation, as, legitimate, they, viewed, narutowicz, rather, as, a, traitor, whose, election, was, pushed, through, by, the, votes, of, alien, minorities, narutowicz, and, his, supporters, were, subjected, to, an, intense, harassment, campaign, and, the, president, was, assassinated, on, 16, december, 1922, after, serving, only, five, days, in, office, land, reform, measures, were, passed, in, 1919, and, 1925, under, pressure, from, an, impoverished, peasantry, they, were, partially, implemented, but, resulted, in, the, parcellation, of, only, 20, of, the, great, agricultural, estates, poland, endured, numerous, economic, calamities, and, disruptions, in, the, early, 1920s, including, waves, of, workers, strikes, such, as, the, 1923, krak, w, riot, the, german, polish, customs, war, initiated, by, germany, in, 1925, was, one, of, the, most, damaging, external, factors, that, put, a, strain, on, poland, s, economy, on, the, other, hand, there, were, also, signs, of, progress, and, stabilization, for, example, a, critical, reform, of, finances, carried, out, by, the, competent, government, of, w, adys, aw, grabski, which, lasted, almost, two, years, certain, other, achievements, of, the, democratic, period, having, to, do, with, the, management, of, governmental, and, civic, institutions, necessary, to, the, functioning, of, the, reunited, state, and, nation, were, too, easily, overlooked, lurking, on, the, sidelines, was, a, disgusted, army, officer, corps, unwilling, to, subject, itself, to, civilian, control, but, ready, to, follow, the, retired, pi, sudski, who, was, highly, popular, with, poles, and, just, as, dissatisfied, with, the, polish, system, of, government, as, his, former, colleagues, in, the, military, on, 12, may, 1926, pi, sudski, staged, the, may, coup, a, military, overthrow, of, the, civilian, government, mounted, against, president, stanis, aw, wojciechowski, and, the, troops, loyal, to, the, legitimate, government, hundreds, died, in, fratricidal, fighting, pi, sudski, was, supported, by, several, leftist, factions, who, ensured, the, success, of, his, coup, by, blocking, the, railway, transportation, of, government, forces, he, also, had, the, support, of, the, conservative, great, landowners, a, move, that, left, the, right, wing, national, democrats, as, the, only, major, social, force, opposed, to, the, takeover, following, the, coup, the, new, regime, initially, respected, many, parliamentary, formalities, but, gradually, tightened, its, control, and, abandoned, pretenses, the, centrolew, a, coalition, of, center, left, parties, was, formed, in, 1929, and, in, 1930, called, for, the,

arrested, ahead, of, the, polish, legislative, election, of, 1930, which, was, rigged, to, award, a, majority, of, seats, to, the, pro, regime, nonpartisan, bloc, for, cooperation, with, the, government, bbwr, the, authoritarian, sanation, regime, sanation, meant, to, denote, healing, that, pi, sudski, led, until, his, death, in, 1935, and, would, remain, in, place, until, 1939, reflected, the, dictator, s, evolution, from, his, center, left, past, to, conservative, alliances, political, institutions, and, parties, were, allowed, to, function, but, the, electoral, process, was, manipulated, and, those, not, willing, to, cooperate, submissively, were, subjected, to, repression, from, 1930, persistent, opponents, of, the, regime, many, of, the, leftist, persuasion, were, imprisoned, and, subjected, to, staged, legal, processes, with, harsh, sentences, such, as, the, brest, trials, or, else, detained, in, the, bereza, kartuska, prison, and, similar, camps, for, political, prisoners, about, three, thousand, were, detained, without, trial, at, different, times, at, the, bereza, internment, camp, between, 1934, and, 1939, in, 1936, for, example, 369, activists, were, taken, there, including, 342, polish, communists, rebellious, peasants, staged, riots, in, 1932, 1933, and, the, 1937, peasant, strike, in, poland, other, civil, disturbances, were, caused, by,

he, assumed, dictatorial, powers, pi, sudski, signed, the, soviet, polish, non, aggression, pact, in, 1932, and, the, german, polish, declaration, of, non, aggression, in, 1934, but, in, 1933, he, insisted, that, there, was, no, threat, from, the, east, or, west, and, said, that, poland, s, politics, were, focused, on, becoming, fully, independent, without, serving, foreign, interests, he, initiated, the, policy, of, maintaining, an, equal, distance, and, an, adjustable, middle, course, regarding, the, two, great, neighbors, later, continued, by, j, zef, beck, pi, sudski, kept, personal, control, of, the, army, but, it, was, poorly, equipped, poorly, trained, and, had, poor, preparations, in, place, for, possible, future, conflicts, his, only, war, plan, was, a, defensive, war, against, a, soviet, invasion, the, slow, modernization, after, pi, sudski, s, death, fell, far, behind, the, progress, made, by, poland, s, neighbors, and, measures, to, protect, the, western, border, discontinued, by, pi, sudski, from, 1926, were, not, undertaken, until, march, 1939, sanation, deputies, in, the, sejm, used, a, parliamentary, maneuver, to, abolish, the, democratic, march, constitution, and, push, through, a, more, authoritarian, april, constitution, in, 1935, it, reduced, the, powers, of, the, sejm, which, pi, sudski, despised, the, process, and, the, resulting, document, were, seen, as, illegitimate, by, the, anti, sanation, opposition, but, during, world, war, ii, the, polish, government, in, exile, recognized, the, april, constitution, in, order, to, uphold, the, legal, continuity, of, the, polish, state, between, 1932, and, 1933, pi, sudski, and, beck, initiated, several, incidents, along, the, borders, with, germany, and, danzig, both, to, test, whether, western, powers, would, protect, the, versailles, arrangements, on, which, polish, security, depended, and, as, preparation, for, a, preventative, war, against, germany, at, the, same, time, they, sent, emissaries, to, london, and, paris, looking, for, their, support, in, stopping, germany, s, rearmament, effort, an, invasion, to, danzig, by, poland, was, scheduled, for, april, 21, 1933, but, the, amassing, of, troops, was, discovered, and, the, invasion, was, postponed, at, the, time, an, invasion, by, poland, would, have, posed, a, serious, military, threat, to, germany, but, with, the, british, rejecting, the, idea, in, favor, of, the, four, power, pact, and, with, wavering, support, from, the, french, the, poles, had, eventually, reneged, on, the, idea, of, invasion, between, 1933, and, 1934, germany, would, increase, its, armament, expenditures, by, 68, and, by, january, 1934, the, two, powers, would, sign, a, ten, year, non, aggression, pact, when, marshal, pi, sudski, died, in, 1935, he, retained, the, support, of, dominant, sections, of, polish, society, even, though, he, never, risked, testing, his, popularity, in, an, honest, election, his, regime, was, dictatorial, but, at, that, time, only, czechoslovakia, remained, democratic, in, all, of, the, regions, neighboring, poland, historians, have, taken, widely, divergent, views, of, the, meaning, and, consequences, of, the, coup, pi, sudski, perpetrated, and, his, personal, rule, that, followed, independence, stimulated, the, development, of, polish, culture, in, the, interbellum, and, intellectual, achievement, was, high, warsaw, whose, population, almost, doubled, between, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, was, a, restless, burgeoning, metropolis, it, outpaced, krak, w, lw, w, and, wilno, the, other, major, population, centers, of, the, country, mainstream, polish, society, was, not, affected, by, the, repressions, of, the, sanation, authorities, overall, many, poles, enjoyed, relative, stability, and, the, economy, improved, markedly, between, 1926, and, 1929, only, to, become, caught, up, in, the, global, great, depression, after, 1929, the, country, s, industrial, production, and, gross, national, income, slumped, by, about, 50, the, great, depression, brought, low, prices, for, farmers, and, unemployment, for, workers, social, tensions, increased, including, rising, antisemitism, a, major, economic, transformation, and, multi, year, state, plan, to, achieve, national, industrial, development, as, embodied, in, the, central, industrial, region, initiative, launched, in, 1936, was, led, by, minister, eugeniusz, kwiatkowski, motivated, primarily, by, the, need, for, a, native, arms, industry, the, initiative, was, in, progress, at, the, time, of, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, kwiatkowski, was, also, the, main, architect, of, the, earlier, gdynia, seaport, project, the, prevalent, in, political, circles, nationalism, was, fueled, by, the, large, size, of, poland, s, minority, populations, and, their, separate, agendas, according, to, the, language, criterion, of, the, polish, census, of, 1931, the, poles, constituted, 69, of, the, population, ukrainians, 15, jews, defined, as, speakers, of, the, yiddish, language, 8, 5, belarusians, 4, 7, germans, 2, 2, lithuanians, 0, 25, russians, 0, 25, and, czechs, 0, 09, with, some, geographical, areas, dominated, by, a, particular, minority, in, time, the, ethnic, conflicts, intensified, and, the, polish, state, grew, less, tolerant, of, the, interests, of, its, national, minorities, in, interwar, poland, compulsory, free, general, education, substantially, reduced, illiteracy, rates, but, discrimination, was, practiced, in, a, way, that, resulted, in, a, dramatic, decrease, in, the, number, of, ukrainian, language, schools, and, official, restrictions, on, jewish, attendance, at, selected, schools, in, the, late, 1930s, the, population, grew, steadily, reaching, 35, million, in, 1939, however, the, overall, economic, situation, in, the, interwar, period, was, one, of, stagnation, there, was, little, money, for, investment, inside, poland, and, few, foreigners, were, interested, in, investing, there, total, industrial, production, barely, increased, between, 1913, and, 1939, within, the, area, delimited, by, the, 1939, borders, but, because, of, population, growth, from, 26, 3, million, in, 1919, to, 34, 8, million, in, 1939, the, per, capita, output, actually, decreased, by, 18, conditions, in, the, predominant, agricultural, sector, kept, deteriorating, between, 1929, and, 1939, which, resulted, in, rural, unrest, and, a, progressive, radicalization, of, the, polish, peasant, movement, that, became, increasingly, inclined, toward, militant, anti, state, activities, it, was, firmly, repressed, by, the, authorities, according, to, norman, davies, the, failures, of, the, sanation, regime, combined, with, the, objective, economic, realities, caused, a, radicalization, of, the, polish, masses, by, the, end, of, the, 1930s, but, he, warns, against, drawing, parallels, with, the, incomparably, more, repressive, regimes, of, nazi, germany, or, the, stalinist, soviet, union, after, pi, sudski, s, death, in, 1935, poland, was, governed, until, and, initially, during, the, german, invasion, of, 1939, by, old, allies, and, subordinates, known, as, pi, sudski, s, colonels, they, had, neither, the, vision, nor, the, resources, to, cope, with, the, perilous, situation, facing, poland, in, the, late, 1930s, the, colonels, had, gradually, assumed, greater, powers, during, pi, sudski, s, life, by, manipulating, the, ailing, marshal, behind, the, scenes, eventually, they, achieved, an, overt, politicization, of, the, army, that, did, nothing, to, help, prepare, the, country, for, war, foreign, policy, was, the, responsibility, of, j, zef, beck, under, whom, polish, diplomacy, attempted, balanced, approaches, toward, germany, and, the, soviet, union, without, success, on, the, basis, of, a, flawed, understanding, of, the, european, geopolitics, of, his, day, beck, had, numerous, foreign, policy, schemes, and, harbored, illusions, of, poland, s, status, as, a, great, power, he, alienated, most, of, poland, s, neighbors, but, is, not, blamed, by, historians, for, the, ultimate, failure, of, relations, with, germany, the, principal, events, of, his, tenure, were, concentrated, in, its, last, two, years, in, the, case, of, the, 1938, polish, ultimatum, to, lithuania, the, polish, action, nearly, resulted, in, a, german, takeover, of, southwest, lithuania, the, klaip, da, region, memel, territory, which, had, a, largely, german, population, also, in, 1938, the, polish, government, opportunistically, undertook, a, hostile, action, against, the, czechoslovak, state, as, weakened, by, the, munich, agreement, and, annexed, a, small, piece, of, territory, on, its, borders, in, this, case, beck, s, understanding, of, the, consequences, of, the, polish, military, move, turned, out, to, be, completely, mistaken, because, in, the, end, the, german, occupation, of, czechoslovakia, markedly, weakened, poland, s, own, position, furthermore, beck, erroneously, believed, that, nazi, soviet, ideological, contradictions, would, preclude, their, cooperation, at, home, increasingly, alienated, and, suppressed, minorities, threatened, unrest, and, violence, extreme, nationalist, circles, such, as, the, national, radical, camp, grew, more, outspoken, one, of, the, groups, the, camp, of, national, unity, combined, many, nationalists, with, sanation, supporters, and, was, connected, to, the, new, strongman, marshal, edward, rydz, mig, y, whose, faction, of, the, sanation, ruling, movement, was, increasingly, nationalistic, in, the, late, 1930s, the, exile, bloc, front, morges, united, several, major, polish, anti, sanation, figures, including, ignacy, paderewski, w, adys, aw, sikorski, wincenty, witos, wojciech, korfanty, and, j, zef, haller, it, gained, little, influence, inside, poland, but, its, spirit, soon, reappeared, during, world, war, ii, within, the, polish, government, in, exile, in, october, 1938, joachim, von, ribbentrop, first, proposed, german, polish, territorial, adjustments, and, poland, s, participation, in, the, anti, comintern, pact, against, the, soviet, union, the, status, of, the, free, city, of, danzig, was, one, of, the, key, bones, of, contention, approached, by, ribbentrop, again, in, march, 1939, the, polish, government, expressed, willingness, to, address, issues, causing, german, concern, but, effectively, rejected, germany, s, stated, demands, and, thus, refused, to, allow, poland, to, be, turned, by, adolf, hitler, into, a, german, puppet, state, hitler, incensed, by, the, british, and, french, declarations, of, support, for, poland, abrogated, the, german, polish, declaration, of, non, aggression, in, late, april, 1939, to, protect, itself, from, an, increasingly, aggressive, nazi, germany, already, responsible, for, the, annexations, of, austria, in, the, anschluss, of, 1938, czechoslovakia, in, 1939, and, a, part, of, lithuania, after, the, 1939, german, ultimatum, to, lithuania, poland, entered, into, a, military, alliance, with, britain, and, france, the, 1939, anglo, polish, military, alliance, and, the, franco, polish, alliance, 1921, as, updated, in, 1939, however, the, two, western, powers, were, defense, oriented, and, not, in, a, strong, position, either, geographically, or, in, terms, of, resources, to, assist, poland, attempts, were, therefore, made, by, them, to, induce, soviet, polish, cooperation, which, they, viewed, as, the, only, militarily, viable, arrangement, diplomatic, manoeuvers, continued, in, the, spring, and, summer, of, 1939, but, in, their, final, attempts, the, franco, british, talks, with, the, soviets, in, moscow, on, forming, an, anti, nazi, defensive, military, alliance, failed, warsaw, s, refusal, to, allow, the, red, army, to, operate, on, polish, territory, doomed, the, western, efforts, the, final, contentious, allied, soviet, exchanges, took, place, on, 21, and, 23, august, 1939, the, regime, of, joseph, stalin, was, the, target, of, an, intense, german, counter, initiative, and, was, concurrently, involved, in, increasingly, effective, negotiations, with, hitler, s, agents, on, 23, august, an, outcome, contrary, to, the, exertions, of, the, allies, became, a, reality, in, moscow, germany, and, the, soviet, union, hurriedly, signed, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, which, secretly, provided, for, the, dismemberment, of, poland, into, nazi, and, soviet, controlled, zones, on, 1, september, 1939, hitler, ordered, an, invasion, of, poland, the, opening, event, of, world, war, ii, poland, had, signed, an, anglo, polish, military, alliance, as, recently, as, the, 25th, of, august, and, had, long, been, in, alliance, with, france, the, two, western, powers, soon, declared, war, on, germany, but, they, remained, largely, inactive, the, period, early, in, the, conflict, became, known, as, the, phoney, war, and, extended, no, aid, to, the, attacked, country, the, technically, and, numerically, superior, wehrmacht, formations, rapidly, advanced, eastwards, and, engaged, massively, in, the, murder, of, polish, civilians, over, the, entire, occupied, territory, on, 17, september, a, soviet, invasion, of, poland, began, the, soviet, union, quickly, occupied, most, of, the, areas, of, eastern, poland, that, were, inhabited, by, a, significant, ukrainian, and, belarusian, minority, the, two, invading, powers, divided, up, the, country, as, they, had, agreed, in, the, secret, provisions, of, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, poland, s, top, government, officials, and, military, high, command, fled, the, war, zone, and, arrived, at, the, romanian, bridgehead, in, mid, september, after, the, soviet, entry, they, sought, refuge, in, romania, among, the, military, operations, in, which, poles, held, out, the, longest, until, late, september, or, early, october, were, the, siege, of, warsaw, the, battle, of, hel, and, the, resistance, of, the, independent, operational, group, polesie, warsaw, fell, on, 27, september, after, a, heavy, german, bombardment, that, killed, tens, of, thousands, civilians, and, soldiers, poland, was, ultimately, partitioned, between, germany, and, the, soviet, union, according, to, the, terms, of, the, german, soviet, frontier, treaty, signed, by, the, two, powers, in, moscow, on, 29, september, gerhard, weinberg, has, argued, that, the, most, significant, polish, contribution, to, world, war, ii, was, sharing, its, code, breaking, results, this, allowed, the, british, to, perform, the, cryptanalysis, of, the, enigma, and, decipher, the, main, german, military, code, which, gave, the, allies, a, major, advantage, in, the, conflict, as, regards, actual, military, campaigns, some, polish, historians, have, argued, that, simply, resisting, the, initial, invasion, of, poland, was, the, country, s, greatest, contribution, to, the, victory, over, nazi, germany, despite, its, defeat, the, polish, army, of, nearly, one, million, men, significantly, delayed, the, start, of, the, battle, of, france, planned, by, the, germans, for, 1939, when, the, nazi, offensive, in, the, west, did, happen, the, delay, caused, it, to, be, less, effective, a, possibly, crucial, factor, in, the, victory, of, the, battle, of, britain, after, germany, invaded, the, soviet, union, as, part, of, its, operation, barbarossa, in, june, 1941, the, whole, of, pre, war, poland, was, overrun, and, occupied, by, german, troops, german, occupied, poland, was, divided, from, 1939, into, two, regions, polish, areas, annexed, by, nazi, germany, directly, into, the, german, reich, and, areas, ruled, under, a, so, called, general, government, of, occupation, the, poles, formed, an, underground, resistance, movement, and, a, polish, government, in, exile, that, operated, first, in, paris, then, from, july, 1940, in, london, polish, soviet, diplomatic, relations, broken, since, september, 1939, were, resumed, in, july, 1941, under, the, sikorski, mayski, agreement, which, facilitated, the, formation, of, a, polish, army, the, anders, army, in, the, soviet, union, in, november, 1941, prime, minister, sikorski, flew, to, the, soviet, union, to, negotiate, with, stalin, on, its, role, on, the, soviet, german, front, but, the, british, wanted, the, polish, soldiers, in, the, middle, east, stalin, agreed, and, the, army, was, evacuated, there, the, organizations, forming, the, polish, underground, state, that, functioned, in, poland, throughout, the, war, were, loyal, to, and, formally, under, the, polish, government, in, exile, acting, through, its, government, delegation, for, poland, during, world, war, ii, hundreds, of, thousands, of, poles, joined, the, underground, polish, home, army, armia, krajowa, a, part, of, the, polish, armed, forces, of, the, government, in, exile, about, 200, 000, poles, fought, on, the, western, front, in, the, polish, armed, forces, in, the, west, loyal, to, the, government, in, exile, and, about, 300, 000, in, the, polish, armed, forces, in, the, east, under, the, soviet, command, on, the, eastern, front, the, pro, soviet, resistance, movement, in, poland, led, by, the, polish, workers, party, was, active, from, 1941, it, was, opposed, by, the, gradually, forming, extreme, nationalistic, national, armed, forces, beginning, in, late, 1939, hundreds, of, thousands, of, poles, from, the, soviet, occupied, areas, were, deported, and, taken, east, of, the, upper, ranking, military, personnel, and, others, deemed, uncooperative, or, potentially, harmful, by, the, soviets, about, 22, 000, were, secretly, executed, by, them, at, the, katyn, massacre, in, april, 1943, the, soviet, union, broke, off, deteriorating, relations, with, the, polish, government, in, exile, after, the, german, military, announced, the, discovery, of, mass, graves, containing, murdered, polish, army, officers, the, soviets, claimed, that, the, poles, committed, a, hostile, act, by, requesting, that, the, red, cross, investigate, these, reports, from, 1941, the, implementation, of, the, nazi, final, solution, began, and, the, holocaust, in, poland, proceeded, with, force, warsaw, was, the, scene, of, the, warsaw, ghetto, uprising, in, april, may, 1943, triggered, by, the, liquidation, of, the, warsaw, ghetto, by, german, ss, units, the, elimination, of, jewish, ghettos, in, german, occupied, poland, took, place, in, many, cities, as, the, jewish, people, were, being, removed, to, be, exterminated, uprisings, were, waged, against, impossible, odds, by, the, jewish, combat, organization, and, other, desperate, jewish, insurgents, at, a, time, of, increasing, cooperation, between, the, western, allies, and, the, soviet, union, in, the, wake, of, the, nazi, invasion, of, 1941, the, influence, of, the, polish, government, in, exile, was, seriously, diminished, by, the, death, of, prime, minister, w, adys, aw, sikorski, its, most, capable, leader, in, a, plane, crash, on, 4, july, 1943, around, that, time, polish, communist, civilian, and, military, organizations, opposed, to, the, government, led, by, wanda, wasilewska, and, supported, by, stalin, were, formed, in, the, soviet, union, in, july, 1944, the, soviet, red, army, and, soviet, controlled, polish, people, s, army, entered, the, territory, of, future, postwar, poland, in, protracted, fighting, in, 1944, and, 1945, the, soviets, and, their, polish, allies, defeated, and, expelled, the, german, army, from, poland, at, a, cost, of, over, 600, 000, soviet, soldiers, lost, the, greatest, single, undertaking, of, the, polish, resistance, movement, in, world, war, ii, and, a, major, political, event, was, the, warsaw, uprising, that, began, on, 1, august, 1944, the, uprising, in, which, most, of, the, city, s, population, participated, was, instigated, by, the, underground, home, army, and, approved, by, the, polish, government, in, exile, in, an, attempt, to, establish, a, non, communist, polish, administration, ahead, of, the, arrival, of, the, red, army, the, uprising, was, originally, planned, as, a, short, lived, armed, demonstration, in, expectation, that, the, soviet, forces, approaching, warsaw, would, assist, in, any, battle, to, take, the, city, the, soviets, had, never, agreed, to, an, intervention, however, and, they, halted, their, advance, at, the, vistula, river, the, germans, used, the, opportunity, to, carry, out, a, brutal, suppression, of, the, forces, of, the, pro, western, polish, underground, the, bitterly, fought, uprising, lasted, for, two, months, and, resulted, in, the, death, or, expulsion, from, the, city, of, hundreds, of, thousands, of, civilians, after, the, defeated, poles, surrendered, on, 2, october, the, germans, carried, out, a, planned, destruction, of, warsaw, on, hitler, s, orders, that, obliterated, the, remaining, infrastructure, of, the, city, the, polish, first, army, fighting, alongside, the, soviet, red, army, entered, a, devastated, warsaw, on, 17, january, 1945, from, the, time, of, the, tehran, conference, in, late, 1943, there, was, broad, agreement, among, the, three, great, powers, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, and, the, soviet, union, that, the, locations, of, the, borders, between, germany, and, poland, and, between, poland, and, the, soviet, union, would, be, fundamentally, changed, after, the, conclusion, of, world, war, ii, stalin, s, view, that, poland, should, be, moved, far, to, the, west, was, accepted, by, polish, communists, whose, organizations, included, the, polish, workers, party, and, the, union, of, polish, patriots, the, communist, led, state, national, council, a, quasi, parliamentary, body, was, in, existence, in, warsaw, from, the, beginning, of, 1944, in, july, 1944, a, communist, controlled, polish, committee, of, national, liberation, was, established, in, lublin, to, nominally, govern, the, areas, liberated, from, german, control, the, move, prompted, protests, from, prime, minister, stanis, aw, miko, ajczyk, and, his, polish, government, in, exile, by, the, time, of, the, yalta, conference, in, february, 1945, the, communists, had, already, established, a, provisional, government, of, the, republic, of, poland, the, soviet, position, at, the, conference, was, strong, because, of, their, decisive, contribution, to, the, war, effort, and, as, a, result, of, their, occupation, of, immense, amounts, of, land, in, central, and, eastern, europe, the, great, powers, gave, assurances, that, the, communist, provisional, government, would, be, converted, into, an, entity, that, would, include, democratic, forces, from, within, the, country, and, active, abroad, but, the, london, based, government, in, exile, was, not, mentioned, a, provisional, government, of, national, unity, and, subsequent, democratic, elections, were, the, agreed, stated, goals, the, disappointing, results, of, these, plans, and, the, failure, of, the, western, powers, to, ensure, a, strong, participation, of, non, communists, in, the, immediate, post, war, polish, government, were, seen, by, many, poles, as, a, manifestation, of, western, betrayal, a, lack, of, accurate, data, makes, it, difficult, to, document, numerically, the, extent, of, the, human, losses, suffered, by, polish, citizens, during, world, war, ii, additionally, many, assertions, made, in, the, past, must, be, considered, suspect, due, to, flawed, methodology, and, a, desire, to, promote, certain, political, agendas, the, last, available, enumeration, of, ethnic, poles, and, the, large, ethnic, minorities, is, the, polish,

in, relation, to, its, prewar, location, to, the, area, between, the, oder, neisse, and, curzon, lines, which, resulted, in, a, country, more, compact, and, with, much, broader, access, to, the, sea, the, poles, lost, 70, of, their, pre, war, oil, capacity, to, the, soviets, but, gained, from, the, germans, a, highly, developed, industrial, base, and, infrastructure, that, made, a, diversified, industrial, economy, possible, for, the, first, time, in, polish, history, the, flight, and, expulsion, of, germans, from, what, was, eastern, germany, prior, to, the, war, began, before, and, during, the, soviet, conquest, of, those, regions, from, the, nazis, and, the, process, continued, in, the, years, immediately, after, the, war, 8, 030, 000, germans, were, evacuated, expelled, or, migrated, by, 1950, early, expulsions, in, poland, were, undertaken, by, the, polish, communist, authorities, even, before, the, potsdam, conference, the, wild, expulsions, from, june, to, mid, july, 1945,

official, declaration, that, the, former, german, inhabitants, of, the, recovered, territories, had, to, be, removed, quickly, to, house, poles, displaced, by, the, soviet, annexation, the, recovered, territories, initially, faced, a, severe, population, shortage, many, exiled, poles, could, not, return, to, the, country, for, which, they, had, fought, because, they, belonged, to, political, groups, incompatible, with, the, new, communist, regimes, or, because, they, originated, from, areas, of, pre, war, eastern, poland, that, were, incorporated, into, the, soviet, union, see, polish, population, transfers, 1944, 1946, some, were, deterred, from, returning, simply, on, the, strength, of, warnings, that, anyone, who, had, served, in, military, units, in, the, west, would, be, endangered, many, poles, were, pursued, arrested, tortured, and, imprisoned, by, the, soviet, authorities, for, belonging, to, the, home, army, or, other, formations, see, anti, communist, resistance,

1940s, both, during, and, after, the, war, according, to, an, estimate, by, historian, jan, grabowski, about, 50, 000, of, the, 250, 000, polish, jews, who, escaped, the, nazis, during, the, liquidation, of, ghettos, survived, without, leaving, poland, the, remainder, perished, more, were, repatriated, from, the, soviet, union, and, elsewhere, and, the, february, 1946, population, census, showed, about, 300, 000, jews, within, poland, s, new, borders, of, the, surviving, jews, many, chose, to, emigrate, or, felt, compelled, to, because, of, the, anti, jewish, violence, in, poland,

auspices, it, was, soon, recognized, by, the, united, states, and, many, other, countries, the, soviet, domination, was, apparent, from, the, beginning, as, prominent, leaders, of, the, polish, underground, state, were, brought, to, trial, in, moscow, the, trial, of, the, sixteen, of, june, 1945, in, the, immediate, post, war, years, the, emerging, communist, rule, was, challenged, by, opposition, groups, including, militarily, by, the, so, called, cursed, soldiers, of, whom, thousands, perished, in, armed, confrontations, or, were, pursued, by, the, ministry, of, public, security,

most, significant, improvement, was, accomplished, in, the, lives, of, polish, peasants, many, of, whom, were, able, to, leave, their, impoverished, and, overcrowded, village, communities, for, better, conditions, in, urban, centers, those, who, stayed, behind, took, advantage, of, the, implementation, of, the, 1944, land, reform, decree, of, the, polish, committee, of, national, liberation,

officially, rehabilitated, worker, riots, in, pozna, in, june, 1956, were, violently, suppressed, but, they, gave, rise, to, the, formation, of, a, reformist, current, within, the, communist, party, amidst, the, continuing, social, and, national, upheaval, a, further, shakeup, took, place, in, the, party, leadership, as, part, of, what, is, known, as, the, polish, october, of, 1956, while, retaining, most, traditional, communist, economic, and, social, aims, the, regime, led, by, w, adys, aw, gomu, ka, the, new, first, secretary, of, the, pzpr, liberalized, internal, life, in, poland,

the, intelligentsia, s, opposition, to, the, authoritarian, system, developed, to, a, sophisticated, level, under, gomu, ka, and, his, successors, the, creative, process, was, often, compromised, by, state, censorship, but, significant, works, were, created, in, fields, such, as, literature, theater, cinema, and, music, among, others, journalism, of, veiled, understanding, and, varieties, of,

decline, for, a, number, of, years, was, reversed, in, march, 1968, when, student, demonstrations, were, suppressed, during, the, 1968, polish, political, crisis, motivated, in, part, by, the, prague, spring, movement, the, polish, opposition, leaders, intellectuals, academics, and, students, used, a, historical, patriotic, dziady, theater, spectacle, series, in, warsaw, and, its, termination,

attention, to, the, role, of, jewish, activists, in, the, events, taking, place, this, provided, ammunition, to, a, nationalistic, and, antisemitic, communist, party, faction, headed, by, mieczys, aw, moczar, that, was, opposed, to, gomu, ka, s, leadership, using, the, context, of, the, military, victory, of, israel, in, the, six, day, war, of, 1967, some, in, the, polish, communist, leadership, waged, an, antisemitic, campaign, against, the, remnants, of, the, jewish, community, in, poland, the, targets, of, this, campaign, were, accused, of, disloyalty, and, active, sympathy, with, israeli, aggression, branded, zionists, they, were, scapegoated, and, blamed, for, the, unrest, in, march, 1968, which, eventually, led, to, the, emigration, of, much, of, poland, s, remaining, jewish,

replaced, gomu, ka, as, first, secretary, of, the, communist, party, the, new, regime, was, seen, as, more, modern, friendly, and, pragmatic, and, at, first, it, enjoyed, a, degree, of, popular, and, foreign, support, to, revitalize, the, economy, from, 1971, the, gierek, regime, introduced, wide, ranging, reforms, that, involved, large, scale, foreign, borrowing, these, actions, initially,
