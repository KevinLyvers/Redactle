the, fatimid, caliphate, or, fatimid, empire, f, t, m, d, arabic, romanized, al, khil, fa, al, f, imiyya, was, a, caliphate, extant, from, the, tenth, to, the, twelfth, centuries, ce, under, the, rule, of, the, fatimids, an, isma, ili, shia, dynasty, spanning, a, large, area, of, north, africa, and, west, asia, it, ranged, from, the, western, mediterranean, in, the, west, to, the, red, sea, in, the, east, the, fatimids, trace, their, ancestry, to, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, s, daughter, fatima, and, her, husband, ali, the, first, shia, imam, the, fatimids, were, acknowledged, as, the, rightful, imams, by, different, isma, ili, communities, as, well, as, by, denominations, in, many, other, muslim, lands, and, adjacent, regions, originating, during, the, abbasid, caliphate, the, fatimids, initially, conquered, ifriqiya, roughly, present, day, tunisia, they, extended, their, rule, across, the, mediterranean, coast, and, ultimately, made, egypt, the, center, of, the, caliphate, at, its, height, the, caliphate, included, in, addition, to, egypt, varying, areas, of, the, maghreb, sicily, the, levant, and, the, hejaz, between, 902, and, 909, the, foundation, of, the, fatimid, state, was, realized, under, the, leadership, of, da, i, missionary, abu, abdallah, whose, conquest, of, aghlabid, ifriqiya, with, the, help, of, kutama, forces, paved, the, way, for, the, establishment, of, the, caliphate, after, the, conquest, abdallah, al, mahdi, billah, was, retrieved, from, sijilmasa, and, then, accepted, as, the, imam, of, the, movement, becoming, the, first, caliph, and, founder, of, the, dynasty, in, 909, in, 921, the, city, of, al, mahdiyya, was, established, as, the, capital, in, 948, they, shifted, their, capital, to, al, mansuriyya, near, kairouan, in, 969, during, the, reign, of, al, mu, izz, they, conquered, egypt, and, in, 973, the, caliphate, was, moved, to, the, newly, founded, fatimid, capital, of, cairo, egypt, became, the, political, cultural, and, religious, centre, of, the, empire, and, it, developed, a, new, and, indigenous, arabic, culture, after, its, initial, conquests, the, caliphate, often, allowed, a, degree, of, religious, tolerance, towards, non, shia, sects, of, islam, as, well, as, to, jews, and, christians, however, its, leaders, made, little, headway, in, persuading, the, egyptian, population, to, adopt, its, religious, beliefs, after, the, reigns, of, al, aziz, and, al, hakim, the, long, reign, of, al, mustansir, entrenched, a, regime, in, which, the, caliph, remained, aloof, from, state, affairs, and, viziers, took, on, greater, importance, political, and, ethnic, factionalism, within, the, army, led, to, a, civil, war, in, the, 1060s, which, threatened, the, empire, s, survival, after, a, period, of, revival, during, the, tenure, of, the, vizier, badr, al, jamali, the, fatimid, caliphate, declined, rapidly, during, the, late, eleventh, and, twelfth, centuries, in, addition, to, internal, difficulties, the, caliphate, was, weakened, by, the, encroachment, of, the, seljuk, turks, into, syria, in, the, 1070s, and, the, arrival, of, the, crusaders, in, the, levant, in, 1097, in, 1171, saladin, abolished, the, dynasty, s, rule, and, founded, the, ayyubid, dynasty, which, incorporated, egypt, back, into, the, nominal, sphere, of, authority, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, the, fatimid, dynasty, claimed, descent, from, fatimah, the, daughter, of, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, the, dynasty, legitimized, its, claim, through, descent, from, muhammad, by, way, of, his, daughter, and, her, husband, ali, the, first, sh, a, im, m, hence, the, dynasty, s, name, f, imiyy, arabic, the, arabic, relative, adjective, for, f, ima, emphasizing, its, alid, descent, the, dynasty, named, itself, simply, the, alid, dynasty, al, dawla, al, alawiyya, but, many, hostile, sunni, sources, only, refer, to, them, as, the, ubaydids, banu, ubayd, after, the, diminutive, form, ubayd, allah, for, the, name, of, the, first, fatimid, caliph, the, fatimid, dynasty, came, to, power, as, the, leaders, of, isma, ilism, a, revolutionary, shi, a, movement, which, was, at, the, same, time, political, and, religious, philosophical, and, social, and, which, originally, proclaimed, nothing, less, than, the, arrival, of, an, islamic, messiah, the, origins, of, that, movement, and, of, the, dynasty, itself, are, obscure, prior, to, the, late, ninth, century, the, fatimid, rulers, were, arab, in, origin, starting, with, its, founder, the, isma, ili, shia, caliph, abdallah, al, mahdi, billah, the, caliphate, s, establishment, was, accomplished, by, kutama, berbers, from, little, kabylia, who, converted, to, the, fatimid, cause, early, and, made, up, its, original, military, forces, the, shi, a, opposed, the, umayyad, and, abbasid, caliphates, whom, they, considered, usurpers, instead, they, believed, in, the, exclusive, right, of, the, descendants, of, ali, through, muhammad, s, daughter, fatima, to, lead, the, muslim, community, this, manifested, itself, in, a, line, of, imams, descendants, of, ali, via, al, husayn, whom, their, followers, considered, as, the, true, representatives, of, god, on, earth, at, the, same, time, there, was, a, widespread, messianic, tradition, in, islam, concerning, the, appearance, of, a, mahd, the, rightly, guided, one, or, q, im, he, who, arises, who, would, restore, true, islamic, government, and, justice, and, usher, in, the, end, times, this, figure, was, widely, expected, not, just, among, the, shi, a, to, be, a, descendant, of, ali, among, shi, a, however, this, belief, became, a, core, tenet, of, their, faith, and, was, applied, to, several, shi, a, leaders, who, were, killed, or, died, their, followers, believed, that, they, had, gone, into, occultation, ghayba, and, would, return, or, be, resurrected, at, the, appointed, time, these, traditions, manifested, themselves, in, the, succession, of, the, sixth, imam, ja, far, al, sadiq, al, sadiq, had, appointed, his, son, isma, il, ibn, ja, far, as, his, successor, but, isma, il, died, before, his, father, and, when, al, sadiq, himself, died, in, 765, the, succession, was, left, open, most, of, his, followers, followed, al, sadiq, s, son, musa, al, kazim, down, to, a, twelfth, and, final, imam, who, supposedly, went, into, occultation, in, 874, and, would, one, day, return, as, the, mahd, this, branch, is, hence, known, as, the, twelvers, others, followed, other, sons, or, even, refused, to, believe, that, al, sadiq, had, died, and, expected, his, return, as, the, mahd, another, branch, believed, that, ja, far, was, followed, by, a, seventh, imam, who, had, gone, into, occultation, and, would, one, day, return, hence, this, party, is, known, as, the, seveners, the, exact, identity, of, that, seventh, imam, was, disputed, but, by, the, late, ninth, century, had, commonly, been, identified, with, muhammad, son, of, isma, il, and, grandson, of, al, sadiq, from, muhammad, s, father, isma, il, the, sect, which, gave, rise, to, the, fatimids, receives, its, name, of, isma, ili, due, to, the, harsh, abbasid, persecution, of, the, alids, the, ismaili, imams, went, into, hiding, and, neither, isma, il, s, nor, muhammad, s, lives, are, well, known, and, after, muhammad, s, death, during, the, reign, of, harun, al, rashid, r, 786, 809, the, history, of, the, early, isma, ili, movement, becomes, obscure, while, the, awaited, mahd, muhammad, ibn, isma, il, remained, hidden, however, he, would, need, to, be, represented, by, agents, who, would, gather, the, faithful, spread, the, word, da, wa, invitation, calling, and, prepare, his, return, the, head, of, this, secret, network, was, the, living, proof, of, the, imam, s, existence, or, seal, ujja, it, is, this, role, that, the, ancestors, of, the, fatimids, are, first, documented, the, first, known, ujja, was, a, certain, abdallah, al, akbar, abdallah, the, elder, a, wealthy, merchant, from, khuzestan, who, established, himself, at, the, small, town, of, salamiya, on, the, western, edge, of, the, syrian, desert, salamiya, became, the, centre, of, the, isma, ili, da, wa, with, abdallah, al, akbar, being, succeeded, by, his, son, and, grandson, as, the, secret, grand, masters, of, the, movement, in, the, last, third, of, the, ninth, century, the, isma, ili, da, wa, spread, widely, profiting, from, the, collapse, of, abbasid, power, in, the, anarchy, at, samarra, and, the, subsequent, zanj, revolt, as, well, as, from, dissatisfaction, among, twelver, adherents, with, the, political, quietism, of, their, leadership, and, the, recent, disappearance, of, the, twelfth, imam, missionaries, d, s, such, as, hamdan, qarmat, and, ibn, hawshab, spread, the, network, of, agents, to, the, area, round, kufa, in, the, late, 870s, and, from, there, to, yemen, 882, and, thence, india, 884, bahrayn, 899, persia, and, the, maghreb, 893, in, 899, abdallah, al, akbar, s, great, grandson, abdallah, became, the, new, head, of, the, movement, and, introduced, a, radical, change, in, the, doctrine, no, longer, was, he, and, his, forebears, merely, the, stewards, for, muhammad, ibn, isma, il, but, they, were, declared, to, be, the, rightful, imams, and, abdallah, himself, was, the, awaited, mahd, various, genealogies, were, later, put, forth, by, the, fatimids, to, justify, this, claim, by, proving, their, descent, from, isma, il, ibn, ja, far, but, even, in, pro, isma, ili, sources, the, succession, and, names, of, imams, differ, while, sunni, and, twelver, sources, of, course, reject, any, fatimid, descent, from, the, alids, altogether, and, consider, them, impostors, abdallah, s, claim, caused, a, rift, in, the, isma, ili, movement, as, hamdan, qarmat, and, other, leaders, denounced, this, change, and, held, onto, the, original, doctrine, becoming, known, as, the, qarmatians, while, other, communities, remained, loyal, to, salamiya, shortly, after, in, 902, 903, pro, fatimid, loyalists, began, a, great, uprising, in, syria, the, large, scale, abbasid, reaction, it, precipitated, and, the, attention, it, brought, on, him, forced, abdallah, to, abandon, salamiya, for, palestine, egypt, and, finally, for, the, maghreb, where, the, d, abu, abdallah, al, shi, i, had, made, great, headway, in, converting, the, kutama, berbers, to, the, isma, ili, cause, unable, to, join, his, d, directly, abdallah, instead, settled, at, sijilmasa, sometime, between, 904, and, 905, prior, to, the, fatimid, rise, to, power, a, large, part, of, the, maghreb, including, ifriqiya, was, under, the, control, of, the, aghlabids, an, arab, dynasty, who, ruled, nominally, on, behalf, the, abbasids, but, were, de, facto, independent, in, 893, the, d, abu, abdallah, al, shi, i, first, settled, among, the, banu, saktan, tribe, part, of, the, larger, kutama, tribe, in, ikjan, near, the, city, of, mila, in, northwestern, algeria, today, however, due, to, hostility, from, the, local, aghlabid, authorities, and, other, kutuma, tribes, he, was, forced, to, leave, ikjan, and, sought, the, protection, of, another, kutama, tribe, the, banu, ghashman, in, tazrut, two, miles, southwest, of, mila, from, there, he, began, to, build, support, for, a, new, movement, shortly, after, the, hostile, kutama, tribes, and, the, arab, lords, of, the, nearby, cities, mila, setif, and, bilizma, allied, together, to, march, against, him, but, he, was, able, to, move, quickly, and, muster, enough, support, from, friendly, kutama, to, defeat, them, one, by, one, before, they, were, able, to, unite, this, first, victory, brought, abu, abdallah, and, his, kutama, troops, valuable, loot, and, attracted, more, support, to, the, d, s, cause, over, the, next, two, years, abu, abdallah, was, able, to, win, over, most, of, the, kutama, tribes, in, the, region, through, either, persuasion, or, coercion, this, left, much, of, the, countryside, under, his, control, while, the, major, cities, remained, under, aghlabid, control, he, established, an, isma, ili, theocratic, state, based, in, tazrut, operating, in, a, way, similar, to, previous, isma, ili, missionary, networks, in, mesopotamia, but, adapted, to, local, kutama, tribal, structures, he, adopted, the, role, of, a, traditional, islamic, ruler, at, the, head, of, this, organization, while, remaining, in, frequent, contact, with, abdallah, he, continued, to, preach, to, his, followers, known, as, the, awliya, allah, friends, of, god, and, to, initiate, them, into, isma, ili, doctrine, in, 902, while, the, aghlabid, emir, ibrahim, ii, was, away, on, campaign, in, sicily, abu, abdallah, struck, the, first, significant, blow, against, aghlabid, authority, in, north, africa, by, attacking, and, capturing, the, city, of, mila, for, the, first, time, this, news, triggered, a, serious, response, from, the, aghlabids, who, sent, a, punitive, expedition, of, 12, 000, men, from, tunis, in, october, of, the, same, year, abu, abdallah, s, forces, were, unable, to, resist, this, counterattack, and, after, two, defeats, they, evacuated, tazrut, which, was, largely, unfortified, and, fled, to, ikjan, leaving, mila, to, be, retaken, ikjan, became, the, new, center, of, the, fatimid, movement, and, the, d, reestablished, his, network, of, missionaries, and, spies, ibrahim, ii, died, in, october, 902, while, in, southern, italy, and, was, succeeded, by, abdallah, ii, in, early, 903, abdallah, ii, set, out, on, another, expedition, to, destroy, ikjan, and, the, kutama, rebels, but, he, ended, the, expedition, prematurely, due, to, troubles, at, home, arising, from, disputes, over, his, succession, on, 27, july, 903, he, was, assassinated, and, his, son, ziyadat, allah, iii, took, power, in, tunis, these, internal, aghlabid, troubles, gave, abu, abdallah, the, opportunity, to, recapture, mila, and, then, go, on, to, capture, setif, another, fortified, city, by, october, or, november, 904, in, 905, the, aghlabids, sent, a, third, expedition, to, try, and, subdue, the, kutama, they, based, themselves, in, constantine, and, in, the, fall, of, 905, after, receiving, further, reinforcements, set, out, to, march, against, abu, abdallah, however, they, were, surprised, by, kutama, forces, on, the, first, day, of, their, march, which, caused, a, panic, and, scattered, their, army, the, aghlabid, general, fled, and, the, kutama, captured, a, large, booty, another, aghlabid, military, expedition, organized, the, next, year, 906, failed, when, the, soldiers, mutinied, around, the, same, time, or, soon, after, abu, abdallah, s, forces, besieged, and, captured, the, fortified, cities, of, tubna, and, bilizma, the, capture, of, tubna, was, significant, as, it, was, the, first, major, commercial, center, to, come, under, abu, abdallah, s, control, meanwhile, ziyadat, allah, iii, moved, his, court, from, tunis, to, raqqada, the, palace, city, near, kairouan, in, response, to, the, growing, threat, he, fortified, raqqada, in, 907, in, early, 907, another, aghlabid, army, marched, eastwards, again, against, abu, abdallah, accompanied, by, berber, reinforcements, from, the, aur, s, mountains, they, were, again, scattered, by, kutama, cavalry, and, retreated, to, baghaya, the, most, fortified, town, on, the, old, southern, roman, road, between, ifriqiya, and, the, central, maghreb, the, fortress, however, fell, to, the, kutama, without, a, siege, when, local, notables, arranged, to, have, the, gates, opened, to, them, in, may, or, june, 907, this, opened, a, hole, in, the, wider, defensive, system, of, ifriqiya, and, created, panic, in, raqqada, ziyadat, allah, iii, stepped, up, anti, fatimid, propaganda, recruited, volunteers, and, took, measures, to, defend, the, weakly, fortified, city, of, kairouan, he, spent, the, winter, of, 907, 908, with, his, army, in, al, aribus, roman, era, laribus, between, present, day, el, kef, and, maktar, expecting, an, attack, from, the, north, however, abu, abdallah, s, forces, had, been, unable, to, capture, the, northerly, city, of, constantine, and, therefore, they, instead, attacked, along, the, southern, road, from, baghaya, in, early, 908, and, captured, maydara, present, day, ha, dra, an, indecisive, battle, subsequently, occurred, between, the, aghalabid, and, kutama, armies, near, dar, madyan, probably, a, site, between, sbeitla, and, kasserine, with, neither, side, gaining, the, upper, hand, during, the, winter, of, 908, 909, abu, abdallah, campaigned, in, the, region, around, chott, el, jerid, capturing, the, towns, of, tuzur, tozeur, nafta, and, qafsa, gafsa, and, taking, control, of, the, region, the, aghlabids, responded, by, besieging, baghaya, soon, afterward, in, the, same, winter, but, they, were, quickly, repelled, on, 25, february, 909, abu, abdallah, set, out, from, ikjan, with, an, army, of, 200, 000, men, for, a, final, invasion, of, kairouan, the, remaining, aghlabid, army, led, by, an, aghlabid, prince, named, ibrahim, ibn, abi, al, aghlab, met, them, near, al, aribus, on, 18, march, the, battle, lasted, until, the, afternoon, when, a, contingent, of, kutama, horsemen, managed, to, outflank, the, aghlabid, army, and, finally, caused, a, rout, when, news, of, the, defeat, reached, raqqada, ziyadat, allah, iii, packed, his, valuable, treasures, and, fled, towards, egypt, the, population, of, kairouan, looted, the, abandoned, palaces, of, raqqada, and, resisted, ibn, abi, al, aghlab, s, calls, to, organise, a, last, ditch, resistance, upon, hearing, of, the, looting, abu, abdallah, sent, an, advance, force, of, kutama, horsemen, who, secured, raqqada, on, 24, march, on, 25, march, 909, saturday, 1, rajab, 296, abu, abdallah, himself, entered, raqqada, and, took, up, residence, here, upon, assuming, power, in, raqqada, abu, abdallah, inherited, much, of, the, aghlabid, state, s, apparatus, and, allowed, its, former, officials, to, continue, working, for, the, new, regime, he, established, a, new, isma, ili, shi, a, regime, on, behalf, of, his, absent, and, for, the, moment, unnamed, master, he, then, led, his, army, west, to, sijilmasa, whence, he, led, abdallah, in, triumph, to, raqqada, which, he, entered, on, 15, january, 910, there, abdallah, publicly, proclaimed, himself, as, caliph, with, the, regnal, name, of, al, mahd, and, presented, his, son, and, heir, with, the, regnal, name, of, al, qa, im, al, mahdi, quickly, fell, out, with, abu, abdallah, not, only, was, the, d, over, powerful, but, he, demanded, proof, that, the, new, caliph, was, the, true, mahd, the, elimination, of, abu, abdallah, al, shi, i, and, his, brother, led, to, an, uprising, among, the, kutama, led, by, a, child, mahd, which, was, suppressed, at, the, same, time, al, mahdi, repudiated, the, millenarian, hopes, of, his, followers, and, curtailed, their, antinomian, tendencies, the, new, regime, regarded, its, presence, in, ifriqiya, as, only, temporary, the, real, target, was, baghdad, the, capital, of, the, fatimids, abbasid, rivals, the, ambition, to, carry, the, revolution, eastward, had, to, be, postponed, after, the, failure, of, two, successive, invasions, of, egypt, led, by, al, qa, im, in, 914, 915, and, 919, 921, in, addition, the, fatimid, regime, was, as, yet, unstable, the, local, population, were, mostly, adherents, of, maliki, sunnism, and, various, kharijite, sects, such, as, ibadism, so, that, the, real, power, base, of, fatimids, in, ifriqiya, was, quite, narrow, resting, on, the, kutama, soldiery, later, extended, by, the, sanhaja, berber, tribes, as, well, the, historian, heinz, halm, describes, the, early, fatimid, state, as, being, in, essence, a, hegemony, of, the, kutama, and, sanhaja, berbers, over, the, eastern, and, central, maghrib, in, 912, al, mahdi, began, looking, for, the, site, of, a, new, capital, along, the, mediterranean, shore, construction, of, the, new, fortified, palace, city, al, mahdiyya, began, in, 916, the, new, city, was, officially, inaugurated, on, 20, february, 921, though, construction, continued, after, this, the, new, capital, was, removed, from, the, sunni, stronghold, of, kairouan, allowing, for, the, establishment, of, a, secure, base, for, the, caliph, and, his, kutama, forces, without, raising, further, tensions, with, the, local, population, the, fatimids, also, inherited, the, aghlabid, province, of, sicily, which, the, aghlabids, had, gradually, conquered, from, the, byzantine, empire, starting, in, 827, the, conquest, was, generally, completed, when, the, last, christian, stronghold, taormina, was, conquered, by, ibrahim, ii, in, 902, however, some, christian, or, byzantine, resistance, continued, in, some, spots, in, the, northeast, of, sicily, until, 967, and, the, byzantines, still, held, territories, in, southern, italy, where, the, aghlabids, had, also, campaigned, this, ongoing, confrontation, with, the, traditional, foe, of, the, islamic, world, provided, the, fatimids, with, a, prime, opportunity, for, propaganda, in, a, setting, where, geography, gave, them, the, advantage, sicily, itself, proved, troublesome, and, only, after, a, rebellion, under, ibn, qurhub, was, subdued, was, fatimid, authority, on, the, island, consolidated, for, a, large, part, of, the, tenth, century, the, fatimids, also, engaged, in, a, rivalry, with, the, umayyads, of, cordoba, who, ruled, al, andalus, and, were, hostile, to, the, fatimids, pretensions, in, an, effort, to, establish, domination, over, the, western, maghreb, in, 911, tahert, which, had, been, briefly, captured, by, abu, abdallah, al, shi, i, in, 909, had, to, be, retaken, by, the, fatimid, general, masala, ibn, habus, of, the, miknasa, tribe, the, first, fatimid, expeditions, to, what, is, now, northern, morocco, occurred, in, 917, and, 921, and, were, primarily, aimed, at, the, principality, of, nakur, which, they, subjugated, on, both, occasions, fez, and, sijilmasa, were, also, captured, in, 921, these, two, expeditions, were, led, by, masala, ibn, habus, who, had, been, made, governor, of, tahert, thereafter, the, weakened, idrisids, and, various, local, zenata, and, sanhaja, leaders, acted, as, proxies, whose, formal, allegiances, oscillated, between, the, umayyads, or, the, fatimids, depending, on, the, circumstances, as, a, result, of, the, political, instability, in, the, western, maghreb, effective, fatimid, control, did, not, extend, much, beyond, the, former, territory, of, the, aghlabids, masala, s, successor, musa, ibn, abi, l, afiya, captured, fez, from, the, idrisids, again, but, in, 932, defected, to, the, umayyads, taking, the, western, maghreb, with, him, the, umayyads, gained, the, upper, hand, again, in, northern, morocco, during, the, 950s, until, the, fatimid, general, jawhar, on, behalf, of, caliph, al, mu, izz, li, din, allah, led, another, major, expedition, to, morocco, in, 958, and, spent, two, years, subjugating, most, of, northern, morocco, he, was, accompanied, by, ziri, ibn, manad, the, leader, of, the, zirids, jawhar, took, sijilmasa, in, september, or, october, 958, and, then, with, the, help, of, ziri, his, forces, took, fez, in, november, 959, he, was, unable, however, to, dislodge, the, umayyad, garrisons, in, sala, sebta, present, day, ceuta, and, tangier, and, this, marked, the, only, time, that, the, fatimid, army, was, present, at, the, strait, of, gibraltar, jawhar, and, ziri, returned, to, al, mansuriyya, in, 960, the, subjugated, parts, of, morocco, including, fez, and, sijilmasa, were, left, under, the, control, of, local, vassals, while, most, of, the, central, maghreb, algeria, including, tahert, was, given, to, ziri, ibn, manad, to, govern, on, the, caliph, s, behalf, all, this, warfare, in, the, maghreb, and, sicily, necessitated, the, maintenance, of, a, strong, army, and, a, capable, fleet, as, well, nevertheless, by, the, time, of, al, mahdi, s, death, in, 934, the, fatimid, caliphate, had, become, a, great, power, in, the, mediterranean, the, reign, of, the, second, fatimid, imam, caliph, al, qa, im, was, dominated, by, the, kharijite, rebellion, of, abu, yazid, starting, in, 943, 4, among, the, zenata, berbers, the, uprising, spread, through, ifriqiya, taking, kairouan, and, blockading, al, qa, im, at, al, mahdiyya, which, was, besieged, in, january, september, 945, al, qa, im, died, during, the, siege, but, this, was, kept, secret, by, his, son, and, successor, isma, il, until, he, had, defeated, abu, yazid, he, then, announced, his, father, s, death, and, proclaimed, himself, imam, and, caliph, as, al, mansur, while, al, mansur, was, campaigning, to, suppress, the, last, remnants, of, the, revolt, a, new, palace, city, was, being, constructed, for, him, south, of, kairouan, construction, began, around, 946, and, it, was, only, fully, completed, under, al, mansur, s, son, and, successor, al, mu, izz, it, was, named, al, mansuriyya, also, known, as, sabra, al, mansuriyya, and, became, the, new, seat, of, the, caliphate, in, 969, jawhar, launched, a, carefully, prepared, and, successful, invasion, of, egypt, which, had, been, under, the, control, of, the, ikhshidids, another, regional, dynasty, whose, formal, allegiance, was, to, the, abbasids, al, mu, izz, had, given, jawhar, specific, instructions, to, carry, out, after, the, conquest, and, one, of, his, first, actions, was, to, found, a, new, capital, named, al, q, hira, cairo, in, 969, the, name, al, q, hirah, arabic, meaning, the, vanquisher, or, the, conqueror, referenced, the, planet, mars, the, subduer, rising, in, the, sky, at, the, time, when, the, construction, of, the, city, started, the, city, was, located, several, miles, northeast, of, fus, t, the, older, regional, capital, founded, by, the, arab, conquerors, in, the, seventh, century, control, of, egypt, was, secured, with, relative, ease, and, soon, afterward, in, 970, jawhar, sent, a, force, to, invade, syria, and, remove, the, remaining, ikhshidids, who, had, fled, there, from, egypt, this, fatimid, force, was, led, by, a, kutama, general, named, ja, far, ibn, fal, this, invasion, was, successful, at, first, and, many, cities, including, damascus, were, occupied, that, same, year, ja, far, s, next, step, was, to, attack, the, byzantines, who, had, captured, antioch, and, subjugated, aleppo, in, 969, around, the, same, time, as, jawhar, was, arriving, in, egypt, but, he, was, forced, to, call, off, the, advance, in, order, to, face, a, new, threat, from, the, east, the, qarmatis, of, bahrayn, responding, to, the, appeal, of, the, recently, defeated, leaders, of, damascus, had, organized, a, large, coalition, of, arab, tribesmen, to, attack, him, ja, far, chose, to, confront, them, in, the, desert, in, august, 971, but, his, army, was, surrounded, and, defeated, and, ja, far, himself, was, killed, a, month, later, the, qarmati, imam, hasan, al, a, am, led, the, army, with, new, reinforcements, from, transjordan, into, egypt, seemingly, without, opposition, the, qarmatis, spent, time, occupying, the, nile, delta, region, which, gave, jawhar, time, to, organize, a, defense, of, fustat, and, cairo, the, qarmati, advance, was, halted, just, north, of, the, city, and, eventually, routed, a, kalbid, relief, force, arriving, by, sea, secured, the, expulsion, of, the, qarmatis, from, egypt, ramla, the, capital, of, palestine, was, retaken, by, the, fatimids, in, may, 972, but, otherwise, the, progress, in, syria, had, been, lost, once, egypt, was, sufficiently, pacified, and, the, new, capital, was, ready, jawhar, sent, for, al, mu, izz, in, ifriqiya, the, caliph, his, court, and, his, treasury, departed, from, al, mansuriyya, in, fall, 972, traveling, by, land, but, shadowed, by, the, fatimid, navy, sailing, along, the, coast, after, making, triumphant, stops, in, major, cities, along, the, way, the, caliph, arrived, in, cairo, on, 10, june, 973, like, other, royal, capitals, before, it, cairo, was, constructed, as, an, administrative, and, palatine, city, housing, the, palaces, of, the, caliph, and, the, official, state, mosque, al, azhar, mosque, in, 988, the, mosque, also, became, an, academic, institution, that, was, central, in, the, dissemination, of, isma, ili, teachings, until, the, last, years, of, the, fatimid, caliphate, the, economic, centre, of, egypt, remained, fustat, where, most, of, the, general, population, lived, and, traded, under, the, fatimids, egypt, became, the, centre, of, an, empire, that, included, at, its, peak, parts, of, north, africa, sicily, the, levant, including, transjordan, the, red, sea, coast, of, africa, tihamah, hejaz, yemen, with, its, most, remote, territorial, reach, being, multan, in, modern, day, pakistan, egypt, flourished, and, the, fatimids, developed, an, extensive, trade, network, both, in, the, mediterranean, and, in, the, indian, ocean, their, trade, and, diplomatic, ties, extending, all, the, way, to, china, under, the, song, dynasty, r, 960, 1279, eventually, determined, the, economic, course, of, egypt, during, the, high, middle, ages, the, fatimid, focus, on, agriculture, further, increased, their, riches, and, allowed, the, dynasty, and, the, egyptians, to, flourish, the, use, of, cash, crops, and, the, propagation, of, the, flax, trade, allowed, fatimids, to, import, other, items, from, various, parts, of, the, world, the, fatimids, built, upon, some, of, the, bureaucratic, foundations, laid, by, the, ikhshidids, and, the, old, abbasid, imperial, order, the, office, of, the, waz, r, vizier, which, existed, under, the, ikhshidids, was, soon, revived, under, the, fatimids, the, first, to, be, appointed, to, this, position, was, the, jewish, convert, ya, qub, ibn, killis, who, was, elevated, to, this, office, in, 979, by, al, mu, izz, s, successor, al, aziz, the, office, of, the, vizier, became, progressively, more, important, over, the, years, as, the, vizier, became, the, intermediary, between, the, caliph, and, the, large, bureaucratic, state, that, he, ruled, in, 975, the, byzantine, emperor, john, tzimisces, retook, most, of, palestine, and, syria, leaving, only, tripoli, in, fatimid, control, he, aimed, to, eventually, capture, jerusalem, but, he, died, in, 976, on, his, way, back, to, constantinople, thus, staving, off, the, byzantine, threat, to, the, fatimids, meanwhile, the, turkish, ghul, m, plural, ghilm, n, meaning, soldiers, recruited, as, slaves, aftakin, a, buyid, refugee, who, had, fled, an, unsuccessful, rebellion, in, baghdad, with, his, own, contingent, of, turkish, soldiers, became, the, protector, of, damascus, he, allied, with, the, qarmatis, and, with, arab, bedouin, tribes, in, syria, and, invaded, palestine, in, the, spring, of, 977, jawhar, once, again, called, into, action, repelled, their, invasion, and, besieged, damascus, however, he, suffered, a, rout, during, the, winter, and, was, forced, to, hold, out, in, ascalon, against, aftakin, when, his, kutama, soldiers, mutinied, in, april, 978, caliph, al, aziz, himself, led, an, army, to, relieve, him, instead, of, returning, to, damascus, aftakin, and, his, turkish, ghilman, joined, the, fatimid, army, and, became, a, useful, instrument, in, the, syrian, effort, after, ibn, killis, became, vizier, in, 979, the, fatimids, changed, tactics, ibn, killis, was, able, to, subjugate, most, of, palestine, and, southern, syria, the, former, ikhshidid, territories, by, paying, off, the, qarmatis, with, an, annual, tribute, and, making, alliances, with, local, tribes, and, dynasties, such, as, the, jarrahids, and, the, banu, kilab, following, another, failed, attempt, by, a, kutama, general, salman, to, take, damascus, the, turkish, ghul, m, bultak, n, finally, succeeded, in, occupying, the, city, for, the, fatimids, in, 983, demonstrating, the, value, of, this, new, force, another, ghul, m, bajk, r, who, appointed, governor, of, damascus, at, this, time, that, same, year, he, tried, and, failed, to, take, aleppo, but, he, was, soon, able, to, conquer, raqqa, and, rahba, in, the, euphrates, valley, present, day, northeast, syria, cairo, eventually, judged, him, to, be, a, little, too, popular, as, governor, of, damascus, and, he, was, forced, to, move, to, raqqa, while, munir, a, eunuch, in, the, caliph, s, household, like, jawhar, before, him, took, direct, control, in, damascus, on, behalf, of, the, caliph, further, north, aleppo, remained, out, of, reach, and, under, hamdanid, control, the, incorporation, of, the, turkish, troops, into, the, fatimid, army, had, long, term, consequences, on, the, one, hand, they, were, a, necessary, addition, to, the, military, in, order, for, the, fatimids, to, compete, militarily, with, other, powers, in, the, region, the, fatimids, began, to, recruit, ghilm, n, much, as, the, abbasids, had, done, before, them, they, were, soon, joined, by, recruited, daylamis, footmen, from, the, buyid, homeland, in, iran, black, africans, from, the, sudan, upper, nile, valley, were, also, recruited, afterward, in, the, short, term, the, kutama, warriors, remained, the, most, important, troops, of, the, caliph, but, resentment, and, rivalry, eventually, grew, between, the, different, ethnic, components, of, the, army, bajk, r, based, in, raqqa, made, another, unsuccessful, attempt, against, aleppo, in, 991, which, resulted, in, his, capture, and, execution, that, same, year, ibn, killis, died, and, munir, was, accused, of, conducting, treasonous, correspondence, with, baghdad, these, difficulties, triggered, a, strong, response, in, cairo, a, major, military, campaign, was, prepared, to, impose, fatimid, control, over, all, of, syria, along, the, way, munir, was, arrested, in, damascus, and, sent, back, to, cairo, circumstances, were, favourable, to, the, fatimids, as, the, byzantine, emperor, basil, ii, was, campaigning, far, away, in, the, balkans, and, the, hamdanid, ruler, sa, d, al, dawla, died, in, late, 991, manj, tak, n, the, turkish, fatimid, commander, advanced, methodically, north, along, the, orontes, valley, he, took, homs, and, hama, in, 992, and, defeated, a, combined, force, from, hamdanid, aleppo, and, byzantine, held, antioch, in, 993, he, took, shayzar, and, in, 994, he, began, the, siege, of, aleppo, in, may, 995, however, basil, ii, unexpectedly, arrived, in, the, region, after, a, forced, march, with, his, army, through, anatolia, forcing, manj, tak, n, to, lift, the, siege, and, return, to, damascus, before, another, fatimid, expedition, could, be, sent, basil, ii, negotiated, a, one, year, truce, with, the, caliph, which, the, fatimids, used, to, recruit, and, build, new, ships, for, their, fleet, in, 996, many, of, the, ships, were, destroyed, by, a, fire, at, al, maqs, the, port, on, the, nile, near, fustat, further, delaying, the, expedition, finally, in, august, 996, al, aziz, died, and, the, objective, of, aleppo, became, secondary, to, other, concerns, before, leaving, for, egypt, al, mu, izz, had, installed, buluggin, ibn, ziri, the, son, of, ziri, bn, manad, who, died, in, 971, as, his, viceroy, in, the, maghreb, this, established, a, dynasty, of, viceroys, with, the, title, of, amir, who, ruled, the, region, on, behalf, of, the, fatimids, their, authority, remained, disputed, in, the, western, maghreb, where, the, rivalry, with, the, umayyads, and, with, local, zenata, leaders, continued, after, jawhar, s, successful, western, expedition, the, umayyads, returned, to, northern, morocco, in, 973, to, reassert, their, authority, buluggin, launched, one, last, expedition, in, 979, 980, that, reestablished, his, authority, in, the, region, temporarily, until, a, final, decisive, umayyad, intervention, in, 984, 985, put, an, end, to, further, efforts, in, 978, the, caliph, also, gave, tripolitania, to, buluggin, to, govern, though, zirid, authority, there, was, later, replaced, by, the, local, banu, khazrun, dynasty, in, 1001, in, 988, buluggin, s, son, and, successor, al, mansur, moved, the, zirid, dynasty, s, base, from, ashir, central, algeria, to, the, former, fatimid, capital, al, mansuriyya, cementing, the, status, of, the, zirids, as, more, or, less, de, facto, independent, rulers, of, ifriqiya, while, still, officially, maintaining, their, allegiance, to, the, fatimid, caliphs, caliph, al, aziz, accepted, this, situation, for, pragmatic, reasons, to, maintain, his, own, formal, status, as, universal, ruler, both, dynasties, exchanged, gifts, and, the, succession, of, new, zirid, rulers, to, the, throne, was, officially, sanctioned, by, the, caliph, in, cairo, after, al, aziz, s, unexpected, death, his, young, son, al, mansur, 11, years, old, was, installed, on, the, throne, as, al, hakim, hasan, ibn, ammar, the, leader, of, the, kalbid, clan, in, egypt, a, military, veteran, and, one, of, the, last, remaining, members, of, al, mu, izz, s, old, guard, initially, became, regent, but, he, was, soon, forced, to, flee, by, barjawan, the, eunuch, and, tutor, of, the, young, al, hakim, who, took, power, in, his, stead, barjawan, stabilized, the, internal, affairs, of, the, empire, but, refrained, from, pursuing, al, aziz, s, policy, of, expansion, towards, aleppo, in, the, year, 1000, barjawan, was, assassinated, by, al, hakim, who, now, took, direct, and, autocratic, control, of, the, state, his, reign, which, lasted, until, his, mysterious, disappearance, in, 1021, is, the, most, controversial, in, fatimid, history, traditional, narratives, have, described, him, as, either, eccentric, or, outright, insane, but, more, recent, studies, have, tried, to, provide, more, measured, explanations, based, on, the, political, and, social, circumstances, of, the, time, among, other, things, al, hakim, was, known, for, executing, his, officials, when, unsatisfied, with, them, seemingly, without, warning, rather, than, dismissing, them, from, their, posts, as, had, been, traditional, practice, many, of, the, executions, were, members, of, the, financial, administration, which, may, mean, that, this, was, al, hakim, s, way, of, trying, to, impose, discipline, in, an, institution, rife, with, corruption, he, also, opened, the, dar, al, ilm, house, of, knowledge, a, library, for, the, study, of, the, sciences, which, was, in, line, with, al, aziz, s, previous, policy, of, cultivating, this, knowledge, for, the, general, population, he, was, noted, for, being, more, accessible, and, willing, to, receive, petitions, in, person, as, well, as, for, riding, out, in, person, among, the, people, in, the, streets, of, fustat, on, the, other, hand, he, was, also, known, for, his, capricious, decrees, aimed, at, curbing, what, he, saw, as, public, improprieties, he, also, unsettled, the, plurality, of, egyptian, society, by, imposing, new, restrictions, on, christians, and, jews, particularly, on, the, way, they, dressed, or, behaved, in, public, he, ordered, or, sanctioned, the, destruction, of, a, number, of, churches, and, monasteries, mostly, coptic, or, melkite, which, was, unprecedented, and, in, 1009, for, reasons, that, remain, unclear, he, ordered, the, demolition, of, the, church, of, the, holy, sephulchre, in, jerusalem, al, hakim, greatly, expanded, the, recruitment, of, black, africans, into, the, army, who, subsequently, became, another, powerful, faction, to, balance, against, the, kutama, turks, and, daylamis, in, 1005, during, his, early, reign, a, dangerous, uprising, led, by, abu, rakwa, was, successfully, put, down, but, had, come, within, striking, distance, of, cairo, in, 1012, the, leaders, of, the, arab, tayyi, tribe, occupied, ramla, and, proclaimed, the, sharif, of, mecca, al, asan, ibn, ja, far, as, the, sunni, anti, caliph, but, the, latter, s, death, in, 1013, led, to, their, surrender, despite, his, policies, against, christians, and, his, demolition, of, the, church, in, jerusalem, al, hakim, maintained, a, ten, year, truce, with, the, byzantines, that, began, in, 1001, for, most, of, his, reign, aleppo, remained, a, buffer, state, that, paid, tribute, to, constantinople, this, lasted, until, 1017, when, the, fatimid, armenian, general, fat, k, finally, occupied, aleppo, at, the, invitation, of, a, local, commander, who, had, expelled, the, hamdanid, ghul, m, ruler, mansur, ibn, lu, lu, after, a, year, or, two, however, fat, k, made, himself, effectively, independent, in, aleppo, al, hakim, also, alarmed, his, isma, ili, followers, in, several, ways, in, 1013, he, announced, the, designation, of, two, great, great, grandsons, of, al, mahdi, as, two, separate, heirs, one, abd, al, ra, m, ibn, ily, s, would, inherit, the, title, of, caliphate, as, the, role, of, political, ruler, and, the, other, abb, s, ibn, shu, ayb, would, inherit, the, imamate, or, religious, leadership, this, was, a, serious, departure, from, a, central, purpose, of, the, fatimid, imam, caliphs, which, was, to, combine, these, two, functions, in, one, person, in, 1015, he, also, suddenly, halted, the, isma, ili, doctrinal, lectures, of, the, maj, lis, al, ikma, sessions, of, wisdom, which, had, taken, place, regularly, inside, the, palace, in, 1021, while, wandering, the, desert, outside, cairo, on, one, of, his, nightly, excursions, he, disappeared, he, was, purportedly, murdered, but, his, body, was, never, found, after, al, hakim, s, death, his, two, designated, heirs, were, killed, putting, an, end, to, his, succession, scheme, and, his, sister, sitt, al, mulk, arranged, to, have, his, 15, year, old, son, ali, installed, on, the, throne, as, al, zahir, she, served, as, his, regent, until, her, death, in, 1023, at, which, point, an, alliance, of, courtiers, and, officials, ruled, with, al, jarjar, a, former, finance, official, at, their, head, fatimid, control, in, syria, was, threatened, during, the, 1020s, in, aleppo, fat, k, who, had, declared, his, independence, was, killed, and, replaced, in, 1022, but, this, opened, the, way, for, a, coalition, of, bedouin, chiefs, from, the, banu, kilab, jarrahids, and, banu, kalb, led, by, salih, ibn, mirdas, to, take, the, city, in, 1024, or, 1025, and, to, begin, imposing, their, control, on, the, rest, of, syria, al, jarjar, sent, anushtakin, al, dizbari, a, turkish, commander, with, a, force, that, defeated, them, in, 1029, at, the, battle, of, uq, uw, na, near, lake, tiberias, in, 1030, the, new, byzantine, emperor, romanos, iii, broke, a, truce, to, invade, northern, syria, and, forced, aleppo, to, recognize, his, suzerainty, his, death, in, 1034, changed, the, situation, again, and, in, 1036, peace, was, restored, in, 1038, aleppo, was, directly, annexed, by, the, fatimids, state, for, the, first, time, al, zahir, died, in, 1036, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, al, mustansir, who, had, the, longest, reign, in, fatimid, history, serving, as, caliph, from, 1036, to, 1094, however, he, remained, largely, uninvolved, in, politics, and, left, the, government, in, the, hands, of, others, he, was, seven, years, old, at, his, accession, and, thus, al, jarjar, continued, to, serve, as, vizier, and, his, guardian, when, al, jarjar, died, in, 1045, a, series, of, court, figures, ran, the, government, until, al, y, z, r, a, jurist, of, palestinian, origin, took, and, kept, the, office, of, vizier, from, 1050, to, 1058, in, the, 1040s, possibly, in, 1041, or, 1044, the, zirids, declared, their, independence, from, the, fatimids, and, recognized, the, sunni, abbasid, caliphs, of, baghdad, which, led, the, fatimids, to, launch, the, devastating, ban, hilal, invasions, of, north, africa, fatimid, suzerainty, over, sicily, also, faded, as, the, muslim, polity, there, fragmented, and, external, attacks, increased, by, 1060, when, the, italo, norman, roger, i, began, his, conquest, of, the, island, completed, in, 1091, the, kalbid, dynasty, along, with, any, fatimid, authority, were, already, gone, there, was, more, success, in, the, east, however, in, 1047, the, fatimid, d, ali, muhammad, al, ulay, i, in, yemen, built, a, fortress, and, recruited, tribes, with, which, he, was, able, to, capture, san, a, in, 1048, in, 1060, he, began, a, campaign, to, conquer, all, of, yemen, capturing, aden, and, zabid, in, 1062, he, marched, on, mecca, where, shukr, ibn, abi, al, futuh, s, death, in, 1061, provided, an, excuse, along, the, way, he, forced, the, zaydi, imam, in, sa, da, into, submission, upon, arriving, in, mecca, he, installed, abu, hashim, muhammad, ibn, ja, far, as, the, new, sharif, and, custodian, of, the, holy, sites, under, the, suzerainty, of, the, fatimids, he, returned, to, san, a, where, he, established, his, family, as, rulers, on, behalf, of, the, fatimid, caliphs, his, brother, founded, the, city, of, ta, izz, while, the, city, of, aden, became, an, important, hub, of, trade, between, egypt, and, india, which, brought, egypt, further, wealth, events, degenerated, in, egypt, and, syria, however, starting, in, 1060, various, local, leaders, began, to, break, away, or, challenge, fatimid, dominion, in, syria, while, the, ethnic, based, army, was, generally, successful, on, the, battlefield, it, had, begun, to, have, negative, effects, on, fatimid, internal, politics, traditionally, the, kutama, element, of, the, army, had, the, strongest, sway, over, political, affairs, but, as, the, turkish, element, grew, more, powerful, it, began, to, challenge, this, in, 1062, the, tentative, balance, between, the, different, ethnic, groups, within, the, fatimid, army, collapsed, and, they, quarreled, constantly, or, fought, each, other, in, the, streets, at, the, same, time, egypt, suffered, a, 7, year, period, of, drought, and, famine, known, as, the, mustansirite, hardship, viziers, came, and, went, in, flurry, the, bureaucracy, broke, down, and, the, caliph, was, unable, or, unwilling, to, assume, responsibilities, in, their, absence, declining, resources, accelerated, the, problems, among, the, different, ethnic, factions, and, outright, civil, war, began, primarily, between, the, turks, under, nasir, al, dawla, ibn, hamdan, a, scion, of, the, hamdanids, of, aleppo, and, black, african, troops, while, the, berbers, shifted, alliance, between, the, two, sides, the, turkish, faction, under, nasir, al, dawla, seized, partial, control, of, cairo, but, their, leader, was, not, given, any, official, title, in, 1067, 1068, they, plundered, the, state, treasury, and, then, looted, any, treasures, they, could, find, in, the, palaces, the, turks, turned, against, nasir, al, dawla, in, 1069, but, he, managed, to, rally,

the, general, population, especially, in, the, capital, which, relied, on, the, countryside, for, food, historical, sources, of, this, period, report, extreme, hunger, and, hardship, in, the, city, even, to, the, point, of, cannibalism, the, depredations, in, the, nile, delta, may, have, also, been, a, turning, point, that, accelerated, the, long, term, decline, of, the, coptic, community, in, egypt, by, 1072, in, a, desperate, attempt, to, save, egypt, al, mustansir, recalled, general, badr, al, jamali, who, was, at, the, time, the, governor, of, acre, badr, led, his, troops, into, egypt, entered, cairo, in, january, 1074, and, successfully, suppressed, the, different, groups, of, the, rebelling, armies, as, a, result, badr, was, made, vizier, becoming, one, of, the, first, military, viziers, arabic, romanized, am, r, al, juy, sh, lit, commander, of, the, armies, who, would, dominate, late, fatimid, politics, in, 1078, al, mustansir, formally, abdicated, responsibility, for, all, state, affairs, to, him, his, de, facto, rule, initiated, a, temporary, and, limited, revival, of, the, fatimid, state, although, it, was, now, faced, with, serious, challenges, badr, reestablished, fatimid, authority, in, the, hejaz, mecca, and, medina, and, the, sulayhids, were, able, to, hold, on, in, yemen, syria, however, saw, the, advance, of, the, sunni, aligned, seljuk, turks, who, had, conquered, much, of, the, middle, east, and, had, become, the, guardians, of, the, abbasid, caliphs, as, well, as, independent, turkmen, groups, atsiz, ibn, uwaq, a, turkmen, of, the, nawaki, tribe, conquered, jerusalem, in, 1073, and, damascus, in, 1076, before, attempting, to, invade, even, egypt, itself, after, defeating, him, at, a, battle, close, to, cairo, badr, was, able, to, start, a, counter, offensive, to, secure, coastal, cities, such, as, gaza, and, ascalon, and, later, tyre, sidon, and, byblos, further, north, in, 1089, badr, made, major, reforms, to, the, state, updating, and, simplifying, the, administration, of, egypt, as, he, was, of, armenian, background, his, term, also, saw, a, large, influx, of, armenian, immigrants, both, christian, and, muslim, into, egypt, the, armenian, church, patronised, by, badr, established, itself, in, the, country, along, with, a, clerical, hierarchy, he, commanded, a, large, contingent, of, armenian, troops, many, if, not, all, of, whom, were, also, christian, badr, also, used, his, relations, and, influence, with, the, coptic, church, for, political, advantage, in, particular, he, enlisted, cyril, ii, coptic, pope, from, 1078, to, 1092, to, secure, the, allegiance, of, the, christian, kingdoms, of, nubia, specifically, makuria, and, ethiopia, specifically, the, zagwe, dynasty, as, vassals, to, the, fatimid, state, the, juyushi, mosque, arabic, lit, the, mosque, of, the, armies, was, commissioned, by, badr, and, completed, in, 1085, under, the, patronage, of, the, caliph, the, mosque, identified, as, a, mashhad, was, also, a, victory, monument, commemorating, vizier, badr, s, restoration, of, order, for, al, mustansir, between, 1087, and, 1092, the, vizier, also, replaced, the, mudbrick, walls, of, cairo, with, new, stone, walls, and, slightly, expanded, the, city, three, of, its, monumental, gates, still, survive, today, bab, zuweila, bab, al, futuh, and, bab, al, nasr, as, the, military, viziers, effectively, became, heads, of, state, the, caliph, himself, was, reduced, to, the, role, of, a, figurehead, the, reliance, on, the, iqta, system, also, ate, into, fatimid, central, authority, as, more, and, more, the, military, officers, at, the, further, ends, of, the, empire, became, semi, independent, badr, al, jamali, died, in, 1094, along, with, caliph, al, mustansir, that, same, year, and, his, son, al, afdal, shahanshah, succeeded, him, in, power, as, vizier, after, al, mustansir, the, caliphate, passed, on, to, al, musta, li, and, after, his, death, in, 1101, it, passed, to, the, 5, year, old, al, amir, another, of, al, mustansir, s, sons, nizar, attempted, to, take, the, throne, after, his, father, s, death, and, organized, a, rebellion, in, 1095, but, he, was, defeated, and, executed, that, same, year, al, afdal, arranged, for, his, sister, to, marry, al, musta, li, and, later, for, his, daughter, to, marry, al, amir, hoping, in, this, way, to, merge, his, family, with, that, of, the, caliphs, he, also, attempted, to, secure, the, succession, of, his, son, to, the, vizierate, as, well, but, this, ultimately, failed, during, al, afdal, s, tenure, 1094, 1121, the, fatimids, faced, a, new, external, threat, the, first, crusade, although, initially, both, sides, intended, to, reach, an, agreement, and, an, alliance, against, the, seljuk, turks, these, negotiations, would, eventually, break, down, first, contact, seems, to, have, been, established, by, the, crusaders, who, sent, in, may, or, june, 1097, on, suggestion, of, byzantine, emperor, alexios, komnenos, an, embassy, to, al, afdal, in, return, the, fatimids, dispatched, an, embassy, to, the, crusading, forces, which, arrived, in, february, 1098, during, their, siege, of, antioch, witnessing, and, congratulating, the, crusaders, on, their, victory, against, the, seljuk, emirs, ridwan, of, aleppo, and, s, kmen, of, jerusalem, as, well, as, stressing, their, friendly, attitude, towards, christians, the, fatimid, embassy, stayed, for, a, month, with, the, crusading, forces, before, returning, via, the, harbour, of, latakia, with, gifts, as, well, as, frankish, ambassadors, it, is, uncertain, whether, an, agreement, was, reached, but, it, seems, that, the, parties, expected, to, reach, a, conclusion, in, cairo, al, afdal, took, then, advantage, of, the, crusader, victory, at, antioch, to, reconquer, jerusalem, in, august, 1098, possibly, to, be, in, a, better, position, in, the, negotiations, with, the, crusaders, the, next, time, both, parties, met, was, at, arqah, in, april, 1099, where, an, impasse, was, reached, in, regard, to, the, question, of, ownership, over, jerusalem, following, this, the, crusaders, crossed, into, fatimid, territory, and, captured, jerusalem, in, july, 1099, while, al, afdal, was, leading, a, relief, army, trying, to, reach, the, city, the, two, forces, finally, clashed, in, the, battle, of, ascalon, in, which, al, afdal, was, defeated, nevertheless, the, initial, negotiations, were, held, against, the, fatimids, and, ibn, al, athir, wrote, that, it, was, said, that, the, fatimids, had, invited, the, crusaders, to, invade, syria, this, defeat, established, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, as, a, new, regional, rival, and, although, many, crusaders, returned, to, europe, having, fulfilled, their, vows, the, remaining, forces, often, aided, by, the, italian, maritime, republics, overran, much, of, the, coastal, levant, with, tripoli, beirut, and, sidon, falling, to, them, between, 1109, and, 1110, the, fatimids, retained, tyre, ascalon, and, gaza, with, the, help, of, their, fleet, after, 1107, a, new, rising, star, rose, through, the, ranks, of, the, regime, in, the, form, of, mu, ammad, al, bin, fatik, better, known, as, al, ma, m, n, al, ba, i, he, managed, to, carry, out, various, administrative, reforms, and, infrastructural, projects, in, the, later, years, of, al, afdal, s, term, including, the, construction, of, an, astronomical, observatory, in, 1119, al, afdal, s, was, assassinated, in, 1121, an, act, blamed, on, the, nizaris, or, assassins, though, the, truth, of, this, is, unconfirmed, al, ba, i, took, al, afdal, s, place, as, vizier, but, unlike, his, predecessors, he, had, less, support, in, the, army, and, was, ultimately, reliant, on, the, caliph, for, power, in, 1124, he, lost, tyre, to, the, crusaders, he, was, also, responsible, for, constructing, a, small, but, notable, mosque, in, cairo, the, al, aqmar, mosque, which, was, completed, in, 1125, and, has, largely, survived, to, the, present, day, that, same, year, however, caliph, al, amir, had, him, arrested, probably, due, to, his, failure, to, resist, the, crusaders, or, due, to, the, caliph, s, resentment, of, his, wealth, and, power, three, years, later, he, was, executed, al, amir, then, ruled, the, caliphate, personally, briefly, interrupting, the, long, period, of, de, facto, rule, by, the, caliph, s, viziers, al, amir, himself, was, assassinated, in, 1130, probably, by, the, nizari, assassins, al, amir, apparently, had, a, son, born, shortly, before, his, death, known, as, al, ayyib, one, of, al, amir, s, cousins, a, grandson, of, al, mustansir, abd, al, majid, had, himself, appointed, regent, under, pressure, from, the, army, one, of, al, afdal, s, sons, abu, ali, ahmad, known, as, kutayf, t, was, appointed, vizier, with, titles, similar, to, al, adal, and, badr, al, jamali, kutayf, t, attempted, to, depose, the, fatimid, dynasty, by, imprisoning, abd, al, majid, and, by, declaring, himself, to, be, the, representative, of, muhammad, al, muntazar, the, hidden, imam, awaited, by, twelver, shi, as, the, coup, did, not, last, long, as, kutayf, t, was, assassinated, in, 1131, by, al, amir, s, followers, in, the, fatimid, establishment, abd, al, majid, was, released, and, resumed, his, role, as, regent, in, 1132, however, he, declared, himself, to, be, the, new, imam, caliph, taking, the, title, of, al, hafiz, sidelining, the, infant, al, ayyib, and, breaking, with, the, tradition, of, the, succession, passing, directly, from, father, to, son, most, of, the, fatimid, lands, acknowledged, his, succession, but, the, sulayhids, in, yemen, did, not, and, broke, away, from, the, caliphate, in, cairo, recognizing, al, ayyib, as, the, true, imam, this, caused, another, schism, between, the, hafizi, and, tayyibi, branches, of, the, musta, li, isma, ilis, in, 1135, al, hafiz, was, pressured, by, the, fatimid, armenian, troops, into, appointing, bahram, a, christian, armenian, to, the, office, of, vizier, opposition, from, muslim, troops, forced, him, to, leave, in, 1137, when, ridwan, a, sunni, muslim, was, appointed, vizier, when, ridwan, began, to, plot, the, deposition, of, al, hafiz, he, was, expelled, from, cairo, and, later, defeated, in, battle, he, accepted, a, pardon, from, the, caliph, and, remained, at, the, palace, al, hafiz, chose, not, to, appoint, another, vizier, and, instead, took, direct, control, of, the, state, until, his, death, in, 1149, during, this, time, the, fervor, of, the, isma, ili, religious, cause, in, egypt, had, significantly, faded, and, political, challenges, to, the, caliph, became, more, common, sunni, muslims, were, also, increasingly, appointed, to, high, posts, the, fatimid, dynasty, largely, continued, to, survive, due, to, the, established, common, interests, that, many, factions, and, elites, had, in, maintaining, the, current, system, of, government, al, hafiz, was, the, last, fatimid, caliph, to, rule, directly, and, the, last, one, to, ascend, to, the, throne, as, an, adult, the, last, three, caliphs, al, zafir, r, 1149, 1154, al, fa, iz, r, 1154, 1160, and, al, adid, r, 1160, 1171, were, all, children, when, they, came, to, the, throne, under, al, zafir, an, elderly, berber, named, ibn, masal, was, initially, vizier, per, the, instructions, left, by, al, hafiz, the, army, however, supported, a, sunni, named, ibn, sallar, instead, whose, supporters, managed, to, defeat, and, kill, ibn, masal, in, battle, after, negotiating, with, the, women, of, the, palace, ibn, sallar, was, installed, as, vizier, in, 1150, in, january, 1153, the, crusader, king, baldwin, iii, of, jerusalem, besieged, ascalon, the, last, remaining, fatimid, foothold, in, the, levant, in, april, ibn, sallar, was, murdered, in, a, plot, organized, by, abbas, his, stepson, and, abbas, s, son, nasr, as, no, relieving, force, arrived, ascalon, surrendered, in, august, on, the, condition, that, the, inhabitants, could, leave, safely, for, egypt, it, was, on, this, occasion, that, the, head, of, husayn, was, allegedly, brought, from, ascalon, to, cairo, where, it, was, housed, in, what, is, now, the, al, hussein, mosque, the, next, year, 1154, nasr, murdered, al, zafir, and, abbas, now, vizier, declared, his, 5, year, old, son, isa, al, fa, iz, the, new, caliph, the, women, of, the, palace, intervened, calling, on, al, i, ibn, ruzz, k, a, muslim, armenian, governor, in, upper, egypt, to, help, tala, i, drove, out, abbas, and, nasr, from, cairo, and, became, vizier, that, same, year, afterwards, he, also, conducted, renewed, operations, against, the, crusaders, but, he, could, do, little, more, than, harass, them, by, sea, al, fa, iz, died, in, 1160, and, tala, i, was, assassinated, in, 1161, by, sitt, al, qusur, a, sister, of, al, zafir, tala, i, s, son, ruzz, k, ibn, al, i, held, the, office, of, vizier, until, 1163, when, he, was, overthrown, and, killed, by, shawar, the, governor, of, qus, as, vizier, shawar, came, into, conflict, with, his, rival, the, arab, general, dirgham, the, internal, disorder, of, the, caliphate, attracted, the, attention, and, meddling, of, the, sunni, zengid, ruler, n, r, ad, d, n, who, was, now, in, control, of, damascus, and, a, large, part, of, syria, and, of, the, king, of, jerusalem, amalric, i, the, crusaders, had, already, forced, tala, i, ibn, ruzzik, to, pay, them, a, tribute, in, 1161, and, had, made, an, attempt, to, invade, egypt, in, 1162, when, shawar, was, driven, out, of, cairo, by, dirgham, in, 1163, he, sought, refuge, and, help, with, nur, al, din, nur, al, din, sent, his, general, asad, al, din, shirkuh, to, seize, egypt, and, reinstall, shawar, as, vizier, the, accomplished, this, task, in, the, summer, of, 1164, when, dirgham, was, defeated, and, killed, shawar, s, remaining, years, continued, in, chaos, as, he, made, shifting, alliances, with, either, the, king, of, jerusalem, or, with, nur, al, din, depending, on, circumstances, in, 1167, the, crusaders, pursued, shirkuh, s, forces, in, to, upper, egypt, in, 1168, shawar, worried, about, the, possible, crusader, capture, of, cairo, infamously, set, fire, to, fustat, in, an, attempt, to, deny, the, crusaders, a, base, from, which, to, besiege, the, capital, after, forcing, the, crusaders, to, leave, egypt, again, shirkuh, finally, had, shawar, murdered, in, 1169, with, the, agreement, of, caliph, al, adid, shirkuh, himself, was, appointed, as, al, adid, s, vizier, but, he, died, unexpectedly, two, months, later, the, position, passed, to, his, nephew, salah, ad, din, yusuf, ibn, ayyub, known, in, the, west, as, saladin, salah, ad, din, was, openly, pro, sunni, and, suppressed, the, shi, a, call, to, prayer, ended, the, isma, ili, doctrinal, lectures, the, maj, lis, al, ikma, and, installed, sunni, judges, he, finally, and, officially, deposed, al, adid, the, last, fatimid, caliph, in, september, 1171, this, ended, the, fatimid, dynasty, and, began, the, ayyubid, sultanate, of, egypt, and, syria, white, was, the, dynastic, colour, of, the, fatimids, in, opposition, to, abbasid, black, while, red, and, yellow, banners, were, associated, with, the, fatimid, caliph, s, person, green, is, also, cited, as, their, dynastic, colour, based, on, a, tradition, that, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, wore, a, green, cloak, the, fatimid, caliphs, were, buried, in, a, mausoleum, known, as, turbat, az, za, faraan, the, saffron, tomb, located, at, the, southern, end, of, the, eastern, fatimid, palace, in, cairo, on, the, site, now, occupied, by, the, khan, el, khalili, market, the, remains, of, the, early, fatimid, caliphs, in, ifriqiya, were, also, transferred, here, when, al, mu, izz, moved, his, capital, to, cairo, however, the, mausoleum, was, completely, demolished, by, the, mamluk, amir, jaharkas, al, khalili, in, 1385, to, make, way, for, the, construction, of, a, new, merchant, building, which, gave, its, name, to, the, present, day, market, during, the, demolition, jaharkas, reportedly, desecrated, the, bones, of, the, fatimid, royal, family, by, having, them, dumped, into, the, rubbish, hills, east, of, the, city, fatimid, society, was, highly, pluralistic, isma, ili, shi, ism, was, the, religion, of, the, state, and, the, caliph, s, court, but, most, of, the, population, followed, different, religions, or, denominations, most, of, the, muslim, population, remained, sunni, and, a, large, part, of, the, population, remained, christian, jews, were, a, smaller, minority, as, in, other, islamic, societies, of, the, time, non, muslims, were, classified, as, dhimmi, s, a, term, which, implied, both, certain, restrictions, and, certain, liberties, though, the, practical, circumstances, of, this, status, varied, from, context, to, context, as, elsewhere, in, the, historic, muslim, world, they, were, required, to, pay, the, jizya, tax, 194, 195, scholars, generally, agree, that, on, the, whole, fatimid, rule, was, highly, tolerant, and, inclusive, towards, different, religious, communities, 195, unlike, western, european, governments, of, the, era, advancement, in, fatimid, state, offices, was, more, meritocratic, than, hereditary, members, of, other, branches, of, islam, like, the, sunnis, were, just, as, likely, to, be, appointed, to, government, posts, as, shiites, tolerance, was, extended, to, non, muslims, such, as, christians, and, jews, who, occupied, high, levels, in, government, based, on, ability, and, this, policy, of, tolerance, ensured, the, flow, of, money, from, non, muslims, in, order, to, finance, the, caliphs, large, army, of, mamluks, brought, in, from, circassia, by, genoese, merchants, there, were, exceptions, to, this, general, attitude, of, tolerance, however, most, notably, by, al, hakim, though, this, has, been, highly, debated, with, al, hakim, s, reputation, among, medieval, muslim, historians, conflated, with, his, role, in, the, druze, faith, christians, in, general, and, copts, in, particular, were, persecuted, by, al, hakim, the, persecution, of, the, christians, included, closing, and, demolishing, churches, and, forced, conversion, to, islam, with, the, succession, of, caliph, al, zahir, the, druze, faced, a, mass, persecution, which, included, large, massacres, against, the, druze, in, antioch, aleppo, and, other, cities, it, s, unclear, what, number, or, percentage, of, the, population, inside, the, caliphate, were, actually, isma, ilis, but, they, always, remained, a, minority, historical, chronicles, report, large, numbers, of, enthusiastic, converts, in, egypt, during, the, reign, of, al, aziz, but, this, trend, dropped, significantly, around, the, middle, of, al, hakim, s, reign, the, fatimid, state, promoted, isma, ili, doctrine, the, da, wa, through, a, hierarchical, organization, the, imam, caliph, as, successor, to, the, prophet, muhammad, was, both, the, political, and, religious, leader, below, the, imam, caliph, the, top, of, this, hierarchy, was, headed, by, the, d, l, du, t, or, supreme, missionary, newcomers, to, the, doctrine, were, initiated, by, attending, the, maj, lis, al, ikma, sessions, of, wisdom, lectures, and, lessons, that, were, delivered, in, a, special, hall, inside, the, palaces, of, cairo, the, doctrine, was, kept, secret, from, those, who, were, not, initiated, additionally, isma, ili, doctrines, were, disseminated, through, the, lectures, hosted, at, al, azhar, mosque, in, cairo, which, became, an, intellectual, center, hosting, teachers, and, students, beyond, the, borders, of, the, fatimid, caliphate, recruitment, to, the, da, wa, continued, to, be, performed, in, secret, as, it, had, been, before, the, caliphate, s, establishment, though, the, many, missionaries, maintained, contact, with, the, leadership, in, ifriqiya, or, egypt, some, of, the, da, i, s, missionaries, abroad, sometimes, came, to, cairo, and, became, important, figures, in, the, state, as, with, the, example, of, al, kirmani, during, al, hakim, s, reign, isma, ili, unity, was, weakened, over, time, by, several, schisms, after, the, establishment, of, the, caliphate, in, addition, to, the, qarmatian, schism, before, its, establishment, the, druze, who, believed, in, the, divinity, of, caliph, al, hakim, were, suppressed, in, egypt, and, elsewhere, but, eventually, found, a, home, in, the, region, of, mount, lebanon, after, the, death, of, caliph, al, mustansir, a, succession, crisis, resulted, in, the, breakaway, of, the, nizaris, who, supported, the, claim, of, his, oldest, son, nizar, as, opposed, to, the, musta, lis, who, supported, the, successful, enthronement, of, al, musta, li, the, nizaris, were, also, suppressed, inside, the, caliphate, s, borders, but, continued, to, be, active, outside, it, mostly, in, iran, iraq, and, parts, of, syria, after, the, death, of, caliph, al, amir, al, hafiz, his, cousin, successfully, claimed, the, title, of, imam, caliph, at, the, expense, of, al, amir, s, infant, son, al, tayyib, those, who, recognized, al, hafiz, in, cairo, were, known, as, the, al, hafizi, branch, but, those, who, opposed, this, unusual, succession, and, supported, the, succession, of, al, tayyib, were, known, as, the, al, tayyibi, branch, this, particular, schism, resulted, in, the, loss, of, fatimid, support, in, yemen, in, ifriqiya, the, sunni, muslims, of, the, cities, largely, followed, the, maliki, school, or, madhhab, the, maliki, school, had, become, predominant, here, during, the, eighth, century, at, the, expense, of, the, hanafi, school, which, had, generally, been, favoured, by, the, aghlabids, in, egypt, the, majority, of, muslims, were, sunni, and, remained, so, throughout, the, fatimid, period, cognizant, of, this, the, fatimid, authorities, introduced, shi, a, changes, to, religious, rituals, only, gradually, after, jawhar, s, conquest, it, was, also, in, this, era, that, the, followers, of, the, hanafi, shafi, i, hanbali, and, maliki, schools, were, beginning, to, think, of, themselves, collectively, to, one, extent, or, another, as, sunni, which, undermined, the, universalism, that, the, shi, a, isma, ilis, promoted, some, shi, as, including, some, hasanid, and, husaynid, families, were, also, present, in, egypt, and, welcomed, the, fatimids, as, fellow, shi, as, or, as, blood, relatives, but, without, necessarily, converting, to, isma, ilism, many, non, isma, ili, muslims, also, accepted, the, fatimid, caliphs, as, having, legitimate, rights, to, lead, the, muslim, community, but, did, not, accept, the, more, absolute, shi, a, beliefs, in, the, concept, of, the, imamate, christians, may, have, still, constituted, a, majority, of, the, population, in, egypt, during, the, fatimid, period, although, scholarly, estimates, on, this, issue, are, tentative, and, vary, between, authors, 194, the, proportion, of, christians, would, have, likely, been, greater, in, the, rural, population, than, in, the, main, cities, among, christians, the, largest, community, were, copts, followed, by, melkite, christians, a, large, number, of, armenian, immigrants, also, arrived, in, egypt, during, the, late, 11th, and, early, 12th, centuries, when, armenian, viziers, like, badr, al, jamali, dominated, the, state, which, led, to, the, armenian, church, establishing, a, foothold, in, the, country, as, well, in, addition, to, churches, in, towns, and, cities, christian, monasteries, also, dotted, the, countryside, some, regions, like, wadi, al, natrun, were, ancient, centres, of, coptic, monasticism, italian, traders, led, by, amalfitans, were, also, present, in, fustat, and, alexandria, moving, goods, between, egypt, and, the, rest, of, the, mediterranean, world, within, the, christian, communities, and, especially, among, copts, there, emerged, a, relatively, affluent, class, of, notables, who, served, as, scribes, or, administrators, in, the, fatimid, regime, these, laymen, used, their, wealth, to, patronize, and, in, turn, influence, their, churches, 198, the, state, also, had, influence, on, the, church, as, demonstrated, by, the, transfer, of, the, coptic, patriarchate, from, alexandria, to, fustat, specifically, what, is, now, old, cairo, during, the, patriarchate, of, cyril, ii, 1078, 1092, due, to, the, demands, of, badr, al, jamali, who, wished, for, the, coptic, pope, to, stay, close, to, the, capital, 202, the, church, of, the, virgin, now, known, as, the, hanging, church, became, the, new, seat, of, the, patriarchate, along, with, an, alternative, church, compound, built, on, the, upper, floor, of, the, st, mercurius, church, until, the, 14th, century, when, the, seat, was, moved, to, the, church, of, the, virgin, mary, in, harat, zuwayla, both, churches, were, residences, of, the, coptic, pope, and, served, as, venues, for, the, consecrations, of, new, popes, and, other, important, religious, events, 202, jewish, communities, existed, across, the, territories, under, fatimid, control, and, also, enjoyed, a, degree, of, self, governance, although, a, smaller, minority, compared, to, christians, and, muslims, their, history, is, relatively, well, documented, thanks, to, the, genizah, documents, the, community, was, divided, between, rabbanites, and, karaites, traditionally, up, until, the, late, 11th, century, the, most, powerful, head, of, the, jewish, community, was, the, ga, on, or, leader, of, the, yeshiva, of, jerusalem, who, appointed, judges, and, other, jewish, community, officials, across, the, region, the, fatimids, formally, charged, the, ga, on, of, jerusalem, with, responsibilities, as, representative, of, the, community, by, 1100, however, a, new, position, was, established, by, egyptian, jews, in, fustat, known, as, the, head, of, the, jews, or, as, the, nagid, this, official, in, the, egyptian, capital, became, recognized, afterward, as, the, head, and, representative, of, the, jewish, community, in, its, dealings, with, the, fatimid, state, this, shift, was, likely, due, to, the, jerusalem, ga, on, s, own, loss, of, influence, and, to, the, jewish, community, s, engagement, with, the, centralizing, politics, that, badr, al, jamali, pursued, around, this, time, which, had, already, resulted, in, the, transfer, of, the, coptic, patriarchate, to, fustat, religious, diversity, notwithstanding, the, spread, of, arabic, as, the, main, language, of, the, population, had, already, progressed, rapidly, before, the, fatimid, period, in, parts, of, egypt, copts, and, possibly, also, some, muslim, communities, were, still, speaking, coptic, when, the, fatimids, arrived, on, the, scene, it, is, during, the, fatimid, period, however, that, coptic, religious, culture, began, to, be, translated, into, arabic, by, the, end, of, the, fatimid, period, 12th, century, many, coptic, christians, could, no, longer, understand, the, coptic, language, and, eventually, its, usage, was, reduced, to, a, liturgical, language, 194, the, fatimid, military, was, based, largely, on, the, kutama, berber, tribesmen, brought, along, on, the, march, to, egypt, and, they, remained, an, important, part, of, the, military, even, after, ifriqiya, began, to, break, away, a, fundamental, change, occurred, when, the, fatimid, caliphate, attempted, to, push, into, syria, in, the, latter, half, of, the, tenth, century, the, fatimids, were, faced, with, the, now, turkish, dominated, forces, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, and, began, to, realize, the, limits, of, their, current, military, thus, during, the, reign, of, al, aziz, billah, and, al, hakim, bi, amr, allah, the, caliph, began, incorporating, armies, of, turks, and, later, black, africans, even, later, other, groups, such, as, armenians, were, also, used, the, army, units, were, generally, separated, along, ethnic, lines, the, berbers, were, usually, the, light, cavalry, and, foot, skirmishers, while, the, turks, were, the, horse, archers, or, heavy, cavalry, known, as, mamluks, the, black, africans, syrians, and, arabs, generally, acted, as, the, heavy, infantry, and, foot, archers, this, ethnic, based, army, system, along, with, the, partial, slave, status, of, many, of, the, imported, ethnic, fighters, would, remain, fundamentally, unchanged, in, egypt, for, many, centuries, after, the, fall, of, the, fatimid, caliphate, the, fatimids, focused, their, military, on, the, defence, of, the, empire, as, threats, presented, which, they, were, able, to, repel, in, the, mid, 10th, century, the, byzantine, empire, was, ruled, by, nikephoros, ii, phokas, who, had, destroyed, the, muslim, emirate, of, crete, in, 961, and, conquered, tartus, al, masaisah, ain, zarbah, among, other, areas, gaining, complete, control, of, iraq, and, the, syrian, borders, and, earning, the, sobriquet, the, pale, death, of, the, saracens, with, the, fatimids, however, he, proved, less, successful, after, renouncing, his, payments, of, tribute, to, the, fatimid, caliphs, he, sent, an, expedition, to, sicily, but, was, forced, by, defeats, on, land, and, sea, to, evacuate, the, island, completely, in, 967, he, made, peace, with, the, fatimids, and, turned, to, defend, himself, against, their, common, enemy, otto, i, who, had, proclaimed, himself, roman, emperor, and, had, attacked, byzantine, possessions, in, italy, al, mahdiyya, the, first, capital, of, the, fatimid, dynasty, was, established, by, its, first, caliph, abdull, h, al, mahd, 297, 322, ah, 909, 934, ce, in, 300, ah, 912, 913, ce, the, caliph, had, been, residing, in, nearby, raqqada, but, chose, this, new, and, more, strategic, location, in, which, to, establish, his, dynasty, the, city, of, al, mahdiyya, is, located, on, a, narrow, peninsula, along, the, coast, of, the, mediterranean, sea, east, of, kairouan, and, just, south, of, the, gulf, of, hammamet, in, modern, day, tunisia, the, primary, concern, in, the, city, s, construction, and, locale, was, defense, with, its, peninsular, topography, and, the, construction, of, a, wall, 8, 3, m, thick, the, city, became, impenetrable, by, land, this, strategic, location, together, with, a, navy, that, the, fatimids, had, inherited, from, the, conquered, aghlabids, made, the, city, of, al, mahdiyya, a, strong, military, base, where, abdull, h, al, mahd, consolidated, power, and, planted, the, seeds, of, the, fatimid, caliphate, for, two, generations, the, city, included, two, royal, palaces, one, for, the, caliph, and, one, for, his, son, and, successor, al, q, im, as, well, as, a, mosque, many, administrative, buildings, and, an, arsenal, al, man, riyya, also, known, as, abra, al, man, riyya, was, established, between, 334, and, 336, ah, 945, and, 948, ce, by, the, third, fatimid, caliph, al, man, r, 334, 41, ah, 946, 53, ce, in, a, settlement, known, as, abra, located, on, the, outskirts, of, kairouan, in, modern, day, tunisia, the, new, capital, was, established, in, commemoration, of, the, victory, of, al, man, r, over, the, kh, rijite, rebel, ab, yaz, d, at, abra, construction, of, the, city, was, not, quite, finished, when, al, man, r, died, in, 953, but, his, son, and, successor, al, mu, izz, finished, it, and, completed, the, city, s, mosque, that, same, year, like, baghdad, the, plan, of, the, city, of, al, man, riyya, is, round, with, the, caliphal, palace, at, its, center, due, to, a, plentiful, water, source, the, city, grew, and, expanded, a, great, deal, under, al, man, r, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, there, were, more, than, 300, hammams, built, during, this, period, in, the, city, as, well, as, numerous, palaces, when, al, man, r, s, successor, al, mu, izz, moved, the, caliphate, to, cairo, he, left, his, deputy, buluggin, ibn, ziri, as, regent, of, ifriqiya, marking, the, beginning, of, the, city, s, zirid, period, in, 1014, 15, the, zirid, ruler, badis, ibn, al, mansur, ordered, merchants, and, artisans, of, kairouan, to, be, transferred, to, al, man, riyya, which, may, have, helped, provoke, a, revolt, in, 1016, which, damaged, the, city, in, 1057, under, pressure, from, the, banu, hilal, invasions, the, zirids, abandoned, al, man, riyya, for, mahdiyya, and, the, city, was, devastated, unlike, kairouan, it, remained, in, ruins, afterwards, and, was, never, revived, the, site, was, pillaged, over, time, modern, archeological, excavations, here, began, in, 1921, cairo, was, established, by, the, fourth, fatimid, caliph, al, mu, izz, in, 359, ah, 970, ce, and, remained, the, capital, of, the, fatimid, caliphate, for, the, duration, of, the, dynasty, the, city, was, officially, named, al, q, hirah, al, mu, izziyya, arabic, which, can, be, translated, as, the, victorious, city, of, al, mu, izz, known, afterward, simply, as, al, q, hira, and, giving, us, the, modern, english, name, cairo, cairo, can, thus, be, considered, the, capital, of, fatimid, cultural, production, though, the, original, fatimid, palace, complex, including, administrative, buildings, and, royal, residents, no, longer, exists, modern, scholars, can, glean, a, good, idea, of, the, original, structure, based, on, the, mamluk, era, account, of, al, maqr, z, perhaps, the, most, important, of, fatimid, monuments, outside, the, palace, complex, is, the, mosque, of, al, azhar, 359, 61, ah, 970, 72, ce, which, still, stands, today, though, the, building, was, significantly, expanded, and, modified, in, later, periods, likewise, the, important, fatimid, mosque, of, al, kim, built, from, 380, to, 403, ah, 990, 1012, ce, under, two, fatimid, caliphs, was, significantly, rebuilt, and, renovated, in, the, 1980s, cairo, remained, the, capital, for, including, al, mu, izz, eleven, generations, of, caliphs, after, which, the, fatimid, caliphate, finally, fell, to, ayyubid, forces, in, 567, ah, 1171, ce, the, fatimids, were, known, for, their, exquisite, arts, the, fatimid, period, is, important, in, the, history, of, islamic, art, and, architecture, as, it, is, one, of, the, earliest, islamic, dynasties, for, which, enough, materials, survive, for, a, detailed, study, of, their, evolution, the, stylistic, diversity, of, fatimid, art, was, also, a, reflection, of, the, wider, cultural, environment, of, the, mediterranean, world, at, this, time, the, most, notable, characteristics, of, their, decorative, arts, are, the, use, of, lively, figurative, motifs, and, the, use, of, an, angular, floriated, kufic, script, for, arabic, inscriptions, among, the, best, known, art, forms, that, flourished, are, a, type, of, ceramic, lustreware, and, the, crafting, of, objects, carved, in, solid, rock, crystal, the, dynasty, also, sponsored, the, production, of, linen, textiles, and, a, tiraz, workshop, a, vast, collection, of, different, luxury, objects, once, existed, within, the, caliph, s, palaces, but, few, examples, of, them, have, survived, to, the, present, day, many, traces, of, fatimid, architecture, exist, in, both, egypt, and, present, day, tunisia, particularly, in, the, former, capitals, of, mahdia, al, mahdiyya, and, cairo, al, qahira, at, mahdia, the, most, important, surviving, monument, is, great, mosque, in, cairo, prominent, examples, include, the, al, azhar, mosque, and, the, al, hakim, mosque, as, well, as, the, smaller, monuments, of, al, aqmar, mosque, the, mashhad, of, sayyida, ruqayya, and, the, mosque, of, al, salih, tala, i, al, azhar, mosque, which, was, also, a, center, of, learning, and, teaching, known, today, as, al, azhar, university, was, named, in, honour, of, fatimah, the, daughter, of, muhammad, from, whom, the, fatimids, claimed, descent, who, was, called, az, zahra, the, brilliant, there, were, two, main, fatimid, palaces, in, cairo, covering, a, huge, area, around, bayn, al, qasrayn, near, khan, el, khalili, parts, of, the, city, walls, constructed, by, badr, al, jamali, most, notably, three, of, its, gates, also, survive, list, of, important, figures, after, al, mustansir, billah, his, sons, nizar, and, al, musta, li, both, claimed,
