imperialism, under, the, medieval, cholas, in, the, mid, 9th, century, ce, as, one, of, the, three, crowned, kings, of, tamilakam, along, with, the, chera, and, pandya, the, dynasty, continued, to, govern, over, varying, territories, until, the, 13th, century, ce, the, heartland, of, the, cholas, was, the, fertile, valley, of, the, kaveri, river, they, ruled, a, significantly, larger, area, at, the, height, of, their, power, from, the, latter, half, of, the, 9th, century, till, the, beginning, of, the, 13th, century, they, unified, peninsular, india, south, of, the, tungabhadra, river, and, held, the, territory, as, one, state, for, three, centuries, between, 907, and, 1215, ce, under, rajaraja, i, and, his, successors, rajendra, i, rajadhiraja, i, rajendra, ii, virarajendra, and,

before, the, 7th, century, ce, the, main, sources, of, information, about, the, early, cholas, are, ancient, tamil, literature, of, the, sangam, period, c, 600, bce, oral, traditions, religious, texts, temple, and, copperplate, inscriptions, later, medieval, cholas, also, claimed, a, long, and, ancient, lineage, the, cholas, are, mentioned, in, ashokan, edicts, inscribed, 273, bce, 232, bce,

brief, references, to, the, chola, country, and, its, towns, ports, and, commerce, in, the, periplus, of, the, erythraean, sea, periplus, maris, erythraei, and, in, the, slightly, later, work, of, the, geographer, ptolemy, mahavamsa, a, buddhist, text, written, down, during, the, 5th, century, ce, recounts, several, conflicts, between, the, inhabitants, of, sri, lanka, and, cholas, in, the, 1st, century, bce, a, commonly, held, view, is, that, chola, is, like, chera, and, pandya, the, name, of, the, ruling, family, or, clan, of, immemorial, antiquity, the, annotator, parimelazhagar, said, the, charity, of, people, with, ancient, lineage, such, as, the, cholas, the, pandyas, and, the, cheras, are, forever, generous, despite, their, reduced, means, other, names, in, common, use, for, the, cholas, are, choda, killi, valavan, sembiyan, and, cenni, killi, perhaps, comes, from, the, tamil, kil, meaning, dig, or, cleave, and, conveys, the, idea, of, a, digger, or, a, worker, of, the, land, this, word, often, forms, an, integral, part, of, early, chola, names, like, nedunkilli, nalankilli, and, so, on, but, almost, drops, out, of, use, in, later, times, valavan, is, most, probably, connected, with, valam, fertility, and, means, owner, or, ruler, of, a, fertile, country, sembiyan, is, generally, taken, to, mean, a, descendant, of, shibi, a, legendary, hero, whose, self, sacrifice, in, saving, a, dove, from, the, pursuit, of, a, falcon, figures, among, the, early, chola, legends, and, forms, the, subject, matter, of, the, sibi, jataka, among, the, jataka, stories, of,

the, cholas, falls, into, four, periods, the, early, cholas, of, the, sangam, literature, the, interregnum, between, the, fall, of, the, sangam, cholas, and, the, rise, of, the, imperial, medieval, cholas, under, vijayalaya, c, 848, the, dynasty, of, vijayalaya, and, finally, the, later, chola, dynasty, of, kulothunga, chola, i, from, the, third, quarter, of, the, 11th, century, the, earliest, chola, kings, for, whom, there, is, tangible, evidence, are, mentioned, in, the, sangam, literature, scholars, generally, agree, that, this, literature, belongs, to, the, late, centuries, before, the, common, era, and, the, early, centuries, of, the, common, era, the, internal, chronology, of, this, literature, is, still, far, from, settled, and, at, present, a, connected, account, of, the, history, of, the, period, cannot, be, derived, it, records, the, names, of, the, kings, and, the, princes, and, of, the, poets, who, extolled, them, the, sangam, literature, also, records, legends, about, mythical, chola, kings, these, myths, speak, of, the, chola, king, kantaman, a, supposed, contemporary, of, the, sage, agastya, whose, devotion, brought, the, river, kaveri, into, existence, two, names, are, prominent, among, those, chola, kings, who, feature, in, sangam, literature, karikala, and, kocengannan, there, are, no, sure, means, of, settling, the, order, of, succession, of, fixing, their, relations, with, one, another, and, with, many, other, princelings, of, around, the, same, period, urayur, now, a, part, of, thiruchirapalli, was, their, oldest, capital, kaveripattinam, also, served, as, an, early, chola, capital, the, mahavamsa, mentions, that, a, chola, prince, known, as, ellalan, invaded, the, rajarata, kingdom, of, sri, lanka, and, conquered, it, in, 235, bce, with, the, help, of, a, mysore, army, there, is, not, much, information, about, the, transition, period, of, around, three, centuries, from, the, end, of, the, sangam, age, c, 300, to, that, in, which, the, pandyas, and, pallavas, dominated, the, tamil, country, an, obscure, dynasty, the, kalabhras, invaded, tamil, country, displaced, the, existing, kingdoms, and, ruled, during, that, time, they, were, displaced, by, the, pallava, dynasty, and, the, pandyan, dynasty, in, the, 6th, century, little, is, known, of, the, fate, of, the, cholas, in, tamil, land, during, the, succeeding, three, centuries, the, cholas, disappeared, from, the, tamil, land, almost, completely, in, this, debacle, though, a, branch, of, them, can, be, traced, towards, the, close, of, the, fifth, century, ce, in, rayalaseema, the, telugu, cholas, whose, kingdom, is, mentioned, by, yuan, chwang, in, the, seventh, century, ce, due, to, kalabhra, invasion, and, the, growing, power, of, pallavas, cholas, migrated, from, their, native, land, uraiyur, to, telugu, country, and, ruled, from, there, as, chieftains, of, pallavas, at, least, since, 540, ce, several, telugu, chola, families, like, renati, cholas, pottapi, cholas, nellore, cholas, velanati, cholas, nannuru, cholas, kondidela, cholas, existed, and, claimed, descent, from, ancient, tamil, king, karikala, chola, the, cholas, had, to, wait, for, another, three, centuries, until, the, accession, of, vijayalaya, chola, belonging, to, pottapi, chola, family, in, the, second, quarter, of, the, ninth, century, to, re, establish, their, dynasty, as, independent, rulers, by, overthrowing, pallavas, and, pandyas, as, per, inscriptions, found, in, and, around, thanjavur, thanjavur, kingdom, was, ruled, by, mutharaiyars, muthurajas, for, three, centuries, their, reign, was, ended, by, vijayalaya, chola, who, captured, thanjavur, from, ilango, mutharaiyar, between, 848, and, 851, ce, epigraphy, and, literature, provide, a, few, glimpses, of, the, transformations, that, came, over, this, line, of, kings, during, this, long, interval, it, is, certain, that, when, the, power, of, the, cholas, fell, to, its, lowest, ebb, and, that, of, the, pandyas, and, pallavas, rose, to, the, north, and, south, of, them, this, dynasty, was, compelled, to, seek, refuge, and, patronage, under, their, more, successful, rivals, despite, their, reduced, powers, the, pandyas, and, pallavas, accepted, chola, princesses, in, marriage, possibly, out, of, regard, for, their, reputation, numerous, pallava, inscriptions, of, this, period, mention, their, having, fought, rulers, of, the, chola, country, the, chola, empire, was, founded, in, 848, ce, by, vijayalaya, a, descendant, of, early, cholas, the, early, chola, kings, expanded, their, territory, and, influence, during, the, early, 10th, century, the, second, chola, king, aditya, i, defeated, the, pallava, dynasty, and, pandyan, dynasty, capturing, tondaimandalam, and, kongu, nadu, later, aditya, s, son, parantaka, i, defeated, the, rashtrakuta, dynasty, in, the, battle, of, vallala, and, also, defeated, the, pandyas, rajaraja, i, and, rajendra, i, would, expand, the, dynasty, to, its, imperial, state, in, the, 11th, century, creating, an, influential, empire, in, the, bay, of, bengal, the, brihadeeswarar, temple, was, also, built, in, this, era, the, chola, dynasty, was, at, the, peak, of, its, influence, and, power, during, the, 11th, century, rajendra, i, conquered, odisha, and, pala, dynasty, of, bengal, and, reached, the, ganges, river, in, north, india, rajendra, chola, i, built, a, new, capital, called, gangaikonda, cholapuram, to, celebrate, his, victories, in, northern, india, rajendra, chola, i, successfully, invaded, the, srivijaya, kingdom, in, southeast, asia, which, led, to, the, decline, of, the, empire, there, he, also, completed, the, conquest, of, a, kingdom, in, rajarata, within, sri, lanka, and, sent, three, diplomatic, missions, to, china, in, 1016, 1033, and, 1077, the, western, chalukya, empire, under, satyashraya, and, someshvara, i, tried, regularly, to, loose, itself, from, chola, domination, primarily, due, to, the, chola, influence, in, the, vengi, kingdom, the, western, chalukyas, mounted, several, unsuccessful, attempts, to, engage, the, chola, emperors, in, war, and, except, for, a, brief, occupation, of, the, vengi, territories, between, 1118, and, 1126, allied, with, prince, vikramaditya, vi, cholas, usually, managed, to, dominate, over, the, chalukyas, in, the, western, deccan, by, defeating, them, in, war, and, levying, tribute, on, them, with, the, occupation, of, dharwar, in, north, central, karnataka, by, the, hoysalas, under, vishnuvardhana, where, he, based, himself, with, his, son, narasimha, i, in, charge, of, the, hoysala, capital, dwarasamudra, around, 1149, and, with, the, kalachuris, occupying, the, chalukyan, capital, for, over, 35, years, from, around, 1150, 1151, the, chalukya, kingdom, had, already, started, to, dissolve, the, cholas, under, kulothunga, chola, iii, collaborated, to, herald, the, dissolution, of, the, chalukyas, by, aiding, the, hoysalas, under, veera, ballala, ii, the, son, in, law, of, the, chola, monarch, and, defeated, the, western, chalukyas, in, a, series, of, wars, with, someshvara, iv, between, 1185, and, 1190, the, last, chalukya, king, s, territories, did, not, even, include, the, erstwhile, chalukyan, capitals, badami, manyakheta, or, kalyani, that, was, the, final, dissolution, of, chalukyan, power, though, the, chalukyas, existed, only, in, name, for, the, period, 1135, 1140, but, the, cholas, remained, stable, until, 1215, and, were, then, absorbed, by, the, pandyan, empire, and, ceased, to, exist, by, 1279, on, the, other, hand, from, 1150, ce, to, 1280, ce, the, pandya, dynasty, became, the, staunchest, opponents, of, the, cholas, and, tried, to, win, independence, for, their, traditional, territories, thus, this, period, saw, constant, warfare, between, the, cholas, and, the, pandyas, besides, the, cholas, regularly, fought, with, the, eastern, gangas, of, kalinga, moreover, under, chola, s, protection, vengi, remained, largely, independent, cholas, also, dominated, the, entire, eastern, coast, with, their, feudatories, the, telugu, cholas, of, velanati, and, nellore, among, others, these, feudatories, always, aided, the, cholas, in, their, successful, campaigns, against, the, chalukyas, and, levied, tribute, on, the, kannada, kingdoms, furthermore, the, cholas, fought, constantly, with, the, sinhala, kings, from, the, rohana, kingdom, of, sri, lanka, who, repeatedly, attempted, to, overthrow, the, chola, occupation, of, rajarata, and, unify, the, island, but, until, the, later, chola, king, kulottunga, i, the, cholas, had, firm, control, over, the, area, in, one, such, instance, the, chola, king, rajadhiraja, chola, ii, was, able, to, defeat, the, sinhalese, aided, by, their, traditional, ally, a, confederation, of, five, pandya, princes, and, kept, the, control, of, rajarata, under, chola, rule, his, successor, the, last, great, chola, monarch, kulottunga, chola, iii, reinforced, the, hold, of, the, chola, territories, by, quelling, further, rebellions, and, disturbances, in, the, rajarata, area, of, sri, lanka, and, madurai, he, also, defeated, hoysala, generals, who, fought, under, veera, ballala, ii, at, karuvur, furthermore, he, also, continued, holding, on, to, traditional, territories, in, tamil, country, eastern, gangavadi, draksharama, vengi, and, kalinga, however, after, defeating, veera, ballala, ii, kulottunga, chola, iii, entered, into, a, marital, alliance, with, him, through, ballala, s, marriage, to, a, chola, princess, which, improved, kulottunga, chola, iii, s, relationship, with, the, hoysalas, during, the, reign, of, rajaraja, chola, i, and, his, successors, rajendra, chola, i, virarajendra, chola, and, kulothunga, chola, i, the, chola, armies, invaded, sri, lanka, the, maldives, and, parts, of, southeast, asia, like, malaysia, indonesia, and, southern, thailand, of, the, srivijaya, empire, in, the, 11th, century, rajaraja, chola, i, launched, several, naval, campaigns, that, resulted, in, the, capture, of, sri, lanka, maldives, and, the, malabar, coast, in, 1025, rajendra, chola, launched, naval, raids, on, the, ports, of, srivijaya, and, against, the, burmese, kingdom, of, pegu, a, chola, inscription, states, that, he, captured, or, plundered, 14, places, which, have, been, identified, with, palembang, tambralinga, and, kedah, among, others, a, second, invasion, was, led, by, virarajendra, chola, who, conquered, kedah, in, malaysia, of, srivijaya, in, the, late, 11th, century, chola, invasion, ultimately, failed, to, install, direct, administration, over, srivijaya, since, the, invasion, was, short, and, only, meant, to, plunder, the, wealth, of, srivijaya, however, this, invasion, gravely, weakened, the, srivijayan, hegemony, and, enabled, the, formation, of, regional, kingdoms, although, the, invasion, was, not, followed, by, direct, cholan, occupation, and, the, region, was, unchanged, geographically, there, were, huge, consequences, in, trade, tamil, traders, encroached, on, the, srivijayan, realm, traditionally, controlled, by, malay, traders, and, the, tamil, guilds, influence, increased, on, the, malay, peninsula, and, the, north, coast, of, sumatra, marital, and, political, alliances, between, the, eastern, chalukyas, began, during, the, reign, of, rajaraja, following, his, invasion, of, vengi, rajaraja, chola, s, daughter, married, chalukya, prince, vimaladitya, and, rajendra, chola, s, daughter, ammanga, devi, was, married, to, the, eastern, chalukya, prince, rajaraja, narendra, virarajendra, chola, s, son, athirajendra, chola, was, assassinated, in, a, civil, disturbance, in, 1070, and, kulothunga, chola, i, the, son, of, ammanga, devi, and, rajaraja, narendra, ascended, the, chola, throne, thus, began, the, later, chola, dynasty, the, later, chola, dynasty, was, led, by, capable, rulers, such, as, kulothunga, chola, i, his, son, vikrama, chola, other, successors, like, rajaraja, chola, ii, rajadhiraja, chola, ii, and, kulothunga, chola, iii, who, conquered, kalinga, ilam, and, kataha, however, the, rule, of, the, later, cholas, between, 1218, starting, with, rajaraja, chola, ii, to, the, last, emperor, rajendra, chola, iii, was, not, as, strong, as, those, of, the, emperors, between, 850, and, 1215, around, 1118, they, lost, control, of, vengi, to, the, western, chalukya, and, gangavadi, southern, mysore, districts, to, the, hoysala, empire, however, these, were, only, temporary, setbacks, because, immediately, following, the, accession, of, king, vikrama, chola, the, son, and, successor, of, kulothunga, chola, i, the, cholas, lost, no, time, in, recovering, the, province, of, vengi, by, defeating, chalukya, someshvara, iii, and, also, recovering, gangavadi, from, the, hoysalas, the, chola, empire, though, not, as, strong, as, between, 850, and, 1150, was, still, largely, territorially, intact, under, rajaraja, chola, ii, 1146, 1175, a, fact, attested, by, the, construction, and, completion, of, the, third, grand, chola, architectural, marvel, the, chariot, shaped, airavatesvara, temple, at, dharasuram, on, the, outskirts, of, modern, kumbakonam, chola, administration, and, territorial, integrity, until, the, rule, of, kulothunga, chola, iii, was, stable, and, very, prosperous, up, to, 1215, but, during, his, rule, itself, the, decline, of, the, chola, power, started, following, his, defeat, by, maravarman, sundara, pandiyan, ii, in, 1215, 16, subsequently, the, cholas, also, lost, control, of, the, island, of, lanka, and, were, driven, out, by, the, revival, of, sinhala, power, in, continuation, of, the, decline, also, marked, by, the, resurgence, of, the, pandyan, dynasty, as, the, most, powerful, rulers, in, south, india, a, lack, of, a, controlling, central, administration, in, its, erstwhile, pandyan, territories, prompted, several, claimants, to, the, pandya, throne, to, cause, a, civil, war, in, which, the, sinhalas, and, the, cholas, were, involved, by, proxy, details, of, the, pandyan, civil, war, and, the, role, played, by, the, cholas, and, sinhalas, are, present, in, the, mahavamsa, as, well, as, the, pallavarayanpettai, inscriptions, the, setbacks, suffered, during, the, final, years, of, kulothunga, i, left, a, somewhat, diminished, empire, kulothunga, s, successors, vikrama, chola, 1118, 1135, ce, and, kulothunga, chola, ii, 1133, 1150, ce, were, capable, and, compassionate, leaders, who, took, care, not, to, involve, their, subjects, in, unnecessary, and, unwinnable, wars, rajaraja, ii, 1146, 1173, ce, rajadhiraja, ii, 1166, 1178, ce, and, kulothunga, chola, iii, 1178, 1218, ce, took, active, roles, in, the, politics, of, the, emerging, revival, of, the, pandyas, meanwhile, the, chola, succession, was, getting, murkier, and, murkier, with, disputes, and, intrigues, during, the, periods, of,
