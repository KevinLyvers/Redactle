of, sovereignty, they, did, not, pay, tribute, to, the, ottoman, empire, instead, the, ottomans, paid, them, in, return, for, their, services, of, providing, skilled, outriders, and, frontline, cavalry, in, their, campaigns, later, on, crimea, lost, power, in, this, relationship, as, the, result, of, a, crisis, in, 1523, during, the, reign, of, me, li, s, successor, mehmed, i, giray, he, died, that, year, and, beginning, with, his, successor, from, 1524, on, crimean, khans, were, appointed, by, the, sultan, the, alliance, of, the, crimean, tatars, and, the, ottomans, was, comparable, to, the, polish, lithuanian, union, in, its, importance, and, durability, the, crimean, cavalry, became, indispensable, for, the, ottomans, campaigns, against, poland, hungary, and, persia, in, 1502,

the, expanded, city, of, bah, eseray, the, slave, trade, was, the, backbone, of, the, economy, of, the, crimean, khanate, the, crimeans, frequently, mounted, raids, into, the, danubian, principalities, poland, lithuania, and, muscovy, to, enslave, people, whom, they, could, capture, for, each, captive, the, khan, received, a, fixed, share, sav, a, of, 10, or, 20, these, campaigns, by, crimean, forces, were, either, sefers, sojourns, officially, declared, military, operations, led, by, the, khans, themselves, or, apuls, despoiling, raids, undertaken, by, groups, of, noblemen, sometimes, illegally, because, they, contravened, treaties, concluded, by, the, khans, with, neighbouring, rulers, for, a, long, time, until, the, early, 18th, century, the, khanate, maintained, a, massive, slave, trade, with, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, middle, east, exporting, about, 2, million, slaves, from, russia, and, poland, lithuania, over, the, period, 1500, 1700, mainly, into, ottoman, empire, caffa, an, ottoman, city, on, crimean, peninsula, and, thus, not, part, of, the, khanate, was, one, of, the, best, known, and, significant, trading, ports, and, slave, markets, in, 1769, a, last, major, tatar, raid, resulted, in, the, capture, of, 20, 000, russian, and, ruthenian, slaves, author, and, historian, brian, glyn, williams, writes, fisher, estimates, that, in, the, sixteenth, century, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, lost, around, 20, 000, individuals, a, year, and, that, from, 1474, to, 1694, as, many, as, a, million, commonwealth, citizens, were, carried, off, into, crimean, slavery, early, modern, sources, are, full, of, descriptions, of, sufferings, of, christian, slaves, captured, by, the, crimean, tatars, in, the, course, of, their, raids, it, seems, that, the, position, and, everyday, conditions, of, a, slave, depended, largely, on, his, her, owner, some, slaves, indeed, could, spend, the, rest, of, their, days, doing, exhausting, labor, as, the, crimean, vizir, minister, sefer, gazi, aga, mentions, in, one, of, his, letters, the, slaves, were, often, a, plough, and, a, scythe, of, their, owners, most, terrible, perhaps, was, the, fate, of, those, who, became, galley, slaves, whose, sufferings, were, poeticized, in, many, ukrainian, dumas, songs, both, female, and, male, slaves, were, often, used, for, sexual, purposes, the, crimeans, had, a, complex, relationship, with, zaporozhian, cossacks, who, lived, to, the, north, of, the, khanate, in, modern, ukraine, the, cossacks, provided, a, measure, of, protection, against, tatar, raids, for, poland, lithuania, and, received, subsidies, for, their, service, they, also, raided, crimean, and, ottoman, possessions, in, the, region, at, times, crimean, khanate, made, alliances, with, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, and, the, zaporizhian, sich, the, assistance, of, sl, m, iii, giray, during, the, khmelnytsky, uprising, in, 1648, contributed, greatly, to, the, initial, momentum, of, military, successes, for, the, cossacks, the, relationship, with, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, was, also, exclusive, as, it, was, the, home, dynasty, of, the, girays, who, sought, sanctuary, in, lithuania, in, the, 15th, century, before, establishing, themselves, on, the, crimean, peninsula, in, the, middle, of, the, 16th, century, the, crimean, khanate, asserted, a, claim, to, be, the, successor, to, the, golden, horde, which, entailed, asserting, the, right, of, rule, over, the, tatar, khanates, of, the, caspian, volga, region, particularly, the, kazan, khanate, and, astrakhan, khanate, this, claim, pitted, it, against, muscovy, for, dominance, in, the, region, a, successful, campaign, by, devlet, i, giray, upon, the, russian, capital, in, 1571, culminated, in, the, burning, of, moscow, and, he, thereby, gained, the, sobriquet, that, al, an, seizer, of, the, throne, the, following, year, however, the, crimean, khanate, lost, access, to, the, volga, once, and, for, all, due, to, its, catastrophic, defeat, in, the, battle, of, molodi, don, cossacks, reached, lower, don, donets, and, azov, by, the, 1580s, and, thus, became, the, north, eastern, neighbours, of, the, khanate, they, attracted, peasants, serfs, and, gentry, fleeing, internal, conflicts, over, population, and, intensifying, exploitation, just, as, zaporozhians, protected, the, southern, borders, of, the, commonwealth, don, cossacks, protected, muscovy, and, themselves, attacked, the, khanate, and, ottoman, fortresses, under, the, influence, of, the, crimean, tatars, and, of, the, ottoman, empire, large, numbers, of, circassians, converted, to, islam, circassian, mercenaries, and, recruits, played, an, important, role, in, the, khan, s, armies, khans, often, married, circassian, women, and, it, was, a, custom, for, young, crimean, princes, to, spend, time, in, circassia, training, in, the, art, of, warfare, several, conflicts, occurred, between, circassians, and, crimean, tatars, in, the, 18th, century, with, the, former, defeating, an, army, of, khan, kaplan, giray, and, ottoman, auxiliaries, in, the, battle, of, kanzhal, the, turkish, traveler, writer, evliya, elebi, mentions, the, impact, of, cossack, raids, from, azak, upon, the, territories, of, the, crimean, khanate, these, raids, ruined, trade, routes, and, severely, depopulated, many, important, regions, by, the, time, evliya, elebi, had, arrived, almost, all, the, towns, he, visited, were, affected, by, the, cossack, raids, in, fact, the, only, place, evliya, elebi, considered, safe, from, the, cossacks, was, the, ottoman, fortress, at, arabat, the, decline, of, the, crimean, khanate, was, a, consequence, of, the, weakening, of, the, ottoman, empire, and, a, change, in, eastern, europe, s, balance, of, power, favouring, its, neighbours, crimean, tatars, often, returned, from, ottoman, campaigns, without, loot, and, ottoman, subsidies, were, less, likely, for, unsuccessful, campaigns, without, sufficient, guns, the, tatar, cavalry, suffered, a, significant, loss, against, european, and, russian, armies, with, modern, equipment, by, the, late, 17th, century, russia, became, too, strong, for, crimean, khan, to, pillage, and, the, treaty, of, karlowitz, 1699, outlawed, further, raids, the, era, of, great, slave, raids, in, russia, and, ukraine, was, over, although, brigands, and, nogay, raiders, continued, their, attacks, and, consequently, russian, hatred, of, the, crimean, khanate, did, not, decrease, these, politico, economic, losses, led, in, turn, to, erosion, of, the, khan, s, support, among, noble, clans, and, internal, conflicts, for, power, ensued, the, nogays, who, provided, a, significant, portion, of, the, crimean, military, forces, also, took, back, their, support, from, the, khans, towards, the, end, of, the, empire, in, the, first, half, of, the, 17th, century, kalmyks, formed, the, kalmyk, khanate, in, the, lower, volga, and, under, ayuka, khan, conducted, many, military, expeditions, against, the, crimean, khanate, and, nogays, by, becoming, an, important, ally, and, later, part, of, the, russian,

outbursts, of, violence, from, the, khan, administration, towards, internal, opposition, on, 8, april, 1783, in, violation, of, the, treaty, after, some, parts, of, treaty, had, been, already,
