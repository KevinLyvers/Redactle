the, comprehensive, history, zizhi, tongjian, claimed, descent, from, the, jin, dynasty, specifically, sima, fu, brother, of, sima, yi, the, uprising, of, the, five, barbarians, led, to, one, in, eight, northerners, migrating, to, the, south, these, immigrants, were, called, qiaoren, lodged, people, accounting, for, one, sixth, of, the, population, of, the, south, at, the, time, with, consideration, of, the, material, loss, refugees, had, experienced, before, arrival, they, were, exempt, from, the, diao, tax, and, other, services, those, whose, registers, were, bound, in, white, paper, were, called, baiji, while, the, others, with, registers, bound, in, yellow, paper, were, called, huangji, when, the, crisis, had, subsided, this, preferential, increasingly, seemed, a, heavy, burden, on, the, people, arousing, dissatisfaction, in, the, natives, hence, tu, duan, was, an, increasingly, important, issue, for, the, eastern, jin, the, eastern, jin, court, established, three, levels, of, administrative, divisions, which, served, as, strongholds, for, the, qiaoren, the, qiaozhou, province, qiaojun, commandery, and, qiaoxian, the, lodged, county, these, lodged, administrative, divisions, were, merely, nominal, without, possessing, actual, domain, or, rather, they, were, local, government, in, exile, what, could, scarcely, be, denied, was, their, significance, in, jin, s, legitimacy, for, the, northern, territory, as, somewhat, an, announcement, furthermore, it, was, also, an, action, done, to, appease, the, refugees, homesickness, which, was, evoking, their, desire, to, reacquire, what, had, been, lost, during, the, rule, of, emperor, yuan, emperor, ming, and, emperor, cheng, the, lodged, administrative, divisions, were, concentrated, in, the, area, south, of, the, huai, river, and, the, lower, yangtze, plain, at, first, there, was, the, lodged, langya, commandery, within, lodged, fei, county, in, jiankang, but, when, it, began, is, not, exactly, known, then, the, lodged, huaide, county, was, also, established, in, jiankang, around, 320, according, to, the, book, of, song, after, disaster, of, yongjia, the, refugees, from, you, ji, qing, bing, yan, and, xu, provinces, came, across, the, huai, river, some, even, came, across, the, yangtze, river, and, stayed, in, jinling, commandery, the, lodged, administrative, divisions, were, established, to, govern, them, the, seats, of, xu, and, yan, provinces, perhaps, were, moved, to, the, area, north, of, the, yangtze, river, where, the, lodged, you, ji, qing, bing, provinces, were, established, the, lodged, pei, qinghe, xiapi, dongguang, pingchang, jiyin, puyang, guangping, taishan, jiyang, and, lu, commanderies, were, established, when, emperor, ming, ruled, the, rebellions, and, invasions, occurring, in, jianghuai, area, led, to, more, refugees, switching, to, settle, in, the, south, of, the, yangtze, river, where, the, lodged, huainan, commandery, was, established, afterwards, however, carrying, these, out, was, more, complex, than, the, policy, was, formulated, several, actual, counties, were, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, lodged, commanderies, a, few, lodged, administrative, divisions, are, still, retained, in, china, nowadays, for, instance, dangtu, county, was, originally, located, in, the, area, of, bengbu, however, the, lodged, dangtu, county, was, established, in, where, it, is, now, and, the, latter, replaced, the, former, inheriting, its, place, name, the, tu, duan, is, the, abbreviation, for, yi, tu, duan, means, classifying, people, according, to, their, present, habitation, to, register, it, was, a, policy, to, ensure, the, ancient, hukou, system, working, since, the, western, jin, these, terms, were, first, recorded, in, the, biographies, of, wei, guan, and, li, chong, included, in, the, book, of, jin, hence, it, was, perhaps, initially, proposed, by, these, two, people, but, was, only, seriously, implemented, during, the, eastern, jin, and, the, southern, dynasties, taoism, was, polarized, in, the, jin, dynasty, the, jin, emperors, repressed, taoists, harshly, but, also, tried, to, exploit, it, given, the, way, it, had, been, used, near, the, end, of, the, han, era, in, the, yellow, turban, rebellion, amidst, the, political, turmoil, of, the, era, many, successful, merchants, small, landowners, and, other, moderately, comfortable, people, found, great, solace, in, taoist, teachings, and, a, number, of, major, clans, and, military, officers, also, took, up, the, faith, ge, hong, emphasized, loyalty, to, the, emperor, as, a, taoist, virtue, he, even, taught, that, rebels, could, never, be, taoist, immortals, which, made, taoism, more, palatable, to, the, imperial, hierarchy, as, a, result, popular, taoist, religions, were, considered, heterodoxy, while, the, official, schools, of, the, court, were, supported, but, the, popular, schools, like, tianshi, taoism, were, still, secretly, held, dear, and, promulgated, amongst, ordinary, people, disunity, disintegration, and, chaos, also, made, buddhism, more, popular, in, part, due, to, the, focus, on, addressing, suffering, the, jin, dynasty, marked, a, critical, era, for, the, mahayana, school, in, china, dharmarak, a, s, 286, translation, of, the, lotus, sutra, was, the, most, important, one, before, kum, raj, va, s, 5th, century, translation, it, was, said, that, there, were, 1, 768, buddhist, temples, in, the, eastern, jin, furthermore, taoism, advanced, chemistry, and, medicine, in, china, whereas, the, contribution, of, mahayana, was, concentrated, in, philosophy, and, literature
