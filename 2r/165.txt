the, hittites, h, t, a, t, s, were, an, anatolian, indo, european, people, who, formed, one, of, the, first, major, civilizations, of, bronze, age, west, asia, possibly, originating, from, beyond, the, black, sea, they, settled, in, modern, day, turkey, in, the, early, 2nd, millennium, bc, the, hittites, formed, a, series, of, polities, in, north, central, anatolia, including, the, kingdom, of, kussara, before, 1750, bc, the, kanesh, or, nesha, kingdom, c, 1750, 1650, bc, and, an, empire, centered, on, hattusa, around, 1650, bc, known, in, modern, times, as, the, hittite, empire, it, reached, its, peak, during, the, mid, 14th, century, bc, under, uppiluliuma, i, when, it, encompassed, most, of, anatolia, and, parts, of, the, northern, levant, and, upper, mesopotamia, bordering, the, rival, empires, of, the, hurri, mitanni, and, assyrians, between, the, 15th, and, 13th, centuries, bc, the, hittites, were, one, of, the, dominant, powers, of, the, near, east, coming, into, conflict, with, the, new, kingdom, of, egypt, the, middle, assyrian, empire, and, the, empire, of, mitanni, by, the, 12th, century, bc, much, of, the, hittite, empire, was, annexed, by, the, middle, assyrian, empire, with, the, remainder, sacked, by, phrygian, newcomers, to, the, region, from, the, late, 12th, century, bc, during, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, the, hittites, splintered, into, several, small, independent, states, some, of, which, survived, until, the, eighth, century, bc, before, succumbing, to, the, neo, assyrian, empire, lacking, a, unifying, continuity, their, descendants, scattered, and, ultimately, merged, into, the, modern, populations, of, the, levant, and, mesopotamia, the, hittite, language, referred, to, by, its, speakers, as, ne, ili, the, language, of, nesa, was, a, distinct, member, of, the, anatolian, branch, of, the, indo, european, language, family, along, with, the, closely, related, luwian, language, it, is, the, oldest, historically, attested, indo, european, language, the, history, of, the, hittite, civilization, is, known, mostly, from, cuneiform, texts, found, in, their, former, territories, and, from, diplomatic, and, commercial, correspondence, found, in, the, various, archives, of, assyria, babylonia, egypt, and, the, broader, middle, east, the, decipherment, of, these, texts, was, a, key, event, in, the, history, of, indo, european, studies, cultural, links, to, prehistoric, scandinavia, have, also, been, suggested, scholars, once, attributed, the, development, of, iron, smelting, to, the, hittites, who, were, believed, to, have, monopolized, ironworking, during, the, bronze, age, this, theory, has, been, increasingly, contested, in, the, 21st, century, with, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, and, subsequent, iron, age, seeing, the, slow, comparatively, continuous, spread, of, ironworking, technology, across, the, region, while, there, are, some, iron, objects, from, bronze, age, anatolia, the, number, is, comparable, to, that, of, iron, objects, found, in, egypt, mesopotamia, and, in, other, places, from, the, same, period, and, only, a, small, number, of, these, objects, are, weapons, x, ray, fluorescence, spectrometry, suggests, that, most, or, all, irons, from, the, bronze, age, are, derived, from, meteorites, the, hittite, military, also, made, successful, use, of, chariots, modern, interest, in, the, hittites, increased, with, the, founding, of, the, republic, of, turkey, in, 1923, the, hittites, attracted, the, attention, of, turkish, archaeologists, such, as, halet, ambel, and, tahsin, zg, during, this, period, the, new, field, of, hittitology, also, influenced, the, naming, of, turkish, institutions, such, as, the, state, owned, etibank, hittite, bank, and, the, foundation, of, the, museum, of, anatolian, civilizations, in, ankara, built, 200, kilometers, 124, miles, west, of, the, hittite, capital, of, hattusa, which, houses, the, world, s, most, comprehensive, exhibition, of, hittite, art, and, artifacts, the, hittites, called, their, kingdom, hattusa, hatti, in, akkadian, a, name, received, from, the, hattians, an, earlier, people, who, had, inhabited, and, ruled, the, central, anatolian, region, until, the, beginning, of, the, second, millennium, bc, and, who, spoke, an, unrelated, language, known, as, hattic, the, modern, conventional, name, hittites, is, due, to, the, initial, identification, of, the, people, of, hattusa, with, the, biblical, hittites, by, 19th, century, archaeologists, the, hittites, would, have, called, themselves, something, closer, to, neshites, or, neshians, after, the, city, of, nesha, which, flourished, for, some, two, hundred, years, until, a, king, named, labarna, renamed, himself, hattusili, i, meaning, the, man, of, hattusa, sometime, around, 1650, bc, and, established, his, capital, city, at, hattusa, before, the, archeological, discoveries, that, revealed, the, hittite, civilization, the, only, source, of, information, about, the, hittites, had, been, the, hebrew, bible, francis, william, newman, expressed, the, critical, view, common, in, the, early, 19th, century, that, no, hittite, king, could, have, compared, in, power, to, the, king, of, judah, as, the, discoveries, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, revealed, the, scale, of, the, hittite, kingdom, archibald, sayce, asserted, that, rather, than, being, compared, to, judah, the, anatolian, civilization, worthy, of, comparison, to, the, divided, kingdom, of, egypt, and, was, infinitely, more, powerful, than, that, of, judah, sayce, and, other, scholars, also, noted, that, judah, and, the, hittites, were, never, enemies, in, the, hebrew, texts, in, the, book, of, kings, they, supplied, the, israelites, with, cedar, chariots, and, horses, and, in, the, book, of, genesis, were, friends, and, allies, to, abraham, uriah, the, hittite, was, a, captain, in, king, david, s, army, and, counted, as, one, of, his, mighty, men, in, 1, chronicles, 11, french, scholar, charles, texier, found, the, first, hittite, ruins, in, 1834, but, did, not, identify, them, as, such, the, first, archaeological, evidence, for, the, hittites, appeared, in, tablets, found, at, the, karum, of, kanesh, now, called, k, ltepe, containing, records, of, trade, between, assyrian, merchants, and, a, certain, land, of, hatti, some, names, in, the, tablets, were, neither, hattic, nor, assyrian, but, clearly, indo, european, the, script, on, a, monument, at, bo, azkale, by, a, people, of, hattusas, discovered, by, william, wright, in, 1884, was, found, to, match, peculiar, hieroglyphic, scripts, from, aleppo, and, hama, in, northern, syria, in, 1887, excavations, at, amarna, in, egypt, uncovered, the, diplomatic, correspondence, of, pharaoh, amenhotep, iii, and, his, son, akhenaten, two, of, the, letters, from, a, kingdom, of, kheta, apparently, located, in, the, same, general, region, as, the, mesopotamian, references, to, land, of, hatti, were, written, in, standard, akkadian, cuneiform, but, in, an, unknown, language, although, scholars, could, interpret, its, sounds, no, one, could, understand, it, shortly, after, this, sayce, proposed, that, hatti, or, khatti, in, anatolia, was, identical, with, the, kingdom, of, kheta, mentioned, in, these, egyptian, texts, as, well, as, with, the, biblical, hittites, others, such, as, max, m, ller, agreed, that, khatti, was, probably, kheta, but, proposed, connecting, it, with, biblical, kittim, rather, than, with, the, biblical, hittites, sayce, s, identification, came, to, be, widely, accepted, over, the, course, of, the, early, 20th, century, and, the, name, hittite, has, become, attached, to, the, civilization, uncovered, at, bo, azk, y, during, sporadic, excavations, at, bo, azk, y, hattusa, that, began, in, 1906, the, archaeologist, hugo, winckler, found, a, royal, archive, with, 10, 000, tablets, inscribed, in, cuneiform, akkadian, and, the, same, unknown, language, as, the, egyptian, letters, from, kheta, thus, confirming, the, identity, of, the, two, names, he, also, proved, that, the, ruins, at, bo, azk, y, were, the, remains, of, the, capital, of, an, empire, that, at, one, point, controlled, northern, syria, under, the, direction, of, the, german, archaeological, institute, excavations, at, hattusa, have, been, under, way, since, 1907, with, interruptions, during, the, world, wars, k, ltepe, was, successfully, excavated, by, professor, tahsin, zg, from, 1948, until, his, death, in, 2005, smaller, scale, excavations, have, also, been, carried, out, in, the, immediate, surroundings, of, hattusa, including, the, rock, sanctuary, of, yaz, l, kaya, which, contains, numerous, rock, reliefs, portraying, the, hittite, rulers, and, the, gods, of, the, hittite, pantheon, the, hittites, used, a, variation, of, cuneiform, called, hittite, cuneiform, archaeological, expeditions, to, hattusa, have, discovered, entire, sets, of, royal, archives, on, cuneiform, tablets, written, either, in, akkadian, the, diplomatic, language, of, the, time, or, in, the, various, dialects, of, the, hittite, confederation, the, museum, of, anatolian, civilizations, in, ankara, turkey, houses, the, richest, collection, of, hittite, and, anatolian, artifacts, the, hittite, kingdom, was, centered, on, the, lands, surrounding, hattusa, and, ne, a, k, ltepe, known, as, the, land, hatti, uru, ha, at, ti, after, hattusa, was, made, the, capital, the, area, encompassed, by, the, bend, of, the, k, z, l, rmak, river, hittite, marassantiya, greek, halys, was, considered, the, core, of, the, empire, and, some, hittite, laws, make, a, distinction, between, this, side, of, the, river, and, that, side, of, the, river, for, example, the, bounty, for, an, escaped, slave, who, had, fled, beyond, the, river, is, higher, than, for, a, slave, caught, on, the, near, side, to, the, west, and, south, of, the, core, territory, lay, the, region, known, as, luwiya, in, the, earliest, hittite, texts, this, terminology, was, replaced, by, the, names, arzawa, and, kizzuwatna, with, the, rise, of, those, kingdoms, nevertheless, the, hittites, continued, to, refer, to, the, language, that, originated, in, these, areas, as, luwian, prior, to, the, rise, of, kizzuwatna, the, heart, of, that, territory, in, cilicia, was, first, referred, to, by, the, hittites, as, adaniya, upon, its, revolt, from, the, hittites, during, the, reign, of, ammuna, it, assumed, the, name, of, kizzuwatna, and, successfully, expanded, northward, to, encompass, the, lower, anti, taurus, mountains, as, well, to, the, north, lived, the, mountain, people, called, the, kaskians, to, the, southeast, of, the, hittites, lay, the, hurrian, empire, of, mitanni, at, its, peak, during, the, reign, of, mur, ili, ii, the, hittite, empire, stretched, from, arzawa, in, the, west, to, mitanni, in, the, east, and, included, many, of, the, kaskian, territories, north, as, far, as, hayasa, azzi, in, the, far, north, east, as, well, as, south, into, canaan, near, the, southern, border, of, lebanon, the, ancestors, of, the, hittites, came, into, anatolia, between, 4400, and, 4100, bc, when, the, anatolian, language, family, split, from, proto, indo, european, recent, genetic, and, archaeological, research, has, indicated, that, proto, anatolian, speakers, arrived, in, this, region, sometime, between, 5000, and, 3000, bc, the, proto, hittite, language, developed, around, 2100, bc, and, the, hittite, language, itself, is, believed, to, have, been, in, use, in, central, anatolia, between, the, 20th, and, 12th, centuries, bc, the, hittites, are, first, associated, with, the, kingdom, of, kussara, sometime, prior, to, 1750, bc, hittites, in, anatolia, during, the, bronze, age, coexisted, with, hattians, and, hurrians, either, by, means, of, conquest, or, by, gradual, assimilation, in, archaeological, terms, relationships, of, the, hittites, to, the, ezero, culture, of, the, balkans, and, maykop, culture, of, the, caucasus, had, previously, been, considered, within, the, migration, framework, analyses, by, david, w, anthony, in, 2007, concluded, that, steppe, herders, who, were, archaic, indo, european, speakers, spread, into, the, lower, danube, valley, about, 4200, 4000, bc, either, causing, or, taking, advantage, of, the, collapse, of, old, europe, he, thought, their, languages, probably, included, archaic, proto, indo, european, dialects, of, the, kind, partly, preserved, later, in, anatolian, and, that, their, descendants, later, moved, into, anatolia, at, an, unknown, time, but, maybe, as, early, as, 3000, bc, j, p, mallory, also, thought, it, was, likely, that, the, anatolians, reached, the, near, east, from, the, north, either, via, the, balkans, or, the, caucasus, in, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, according, to, parpola, the, appearance, of, indo, european, speakers, from, europe, into, anatolia, and, the, appearance, of, hittite, was, related, to, later, migrations, of, proto, indo, european, speakers, from, the, yamnaya, culture, into, the, danube, valley, at, c, 2800, bc, which, was, in, line, with, the, customary, assumption, that, the, anatolian, indo, european, language, was, introduced, into, anatolia, sometime, in, the, third, millennium, bc, however, petra, goedegebuure, has, shown, that, the, hittite, language, has, borrowed, many, words, related, to, agriculture, from, cultures, on, their, eastern, borders, which, is, evidence, of, having, taken, a, route, across, the, caucasus, the, dominant, indigenous, inhabitants, in, central, anatolia, were, hurrians, and, hattians, who, spoke, non, indo, european, languages, some, have, argued, that, hattic, was, a, northwest, caucasian, language, but, its, affiliation, remains, uncertain, whilst, the, hurrian, language, was, a, near, isolate, i, e, it, was, one, of, only, two, or, three, languages, in, the, hurro, urartian, family, there, were, also, assyrian, colonies, in, the, region, during, the, old, assyrian, empire, 2025, 1750, bc, it, was, from, the, assyrian, speakers, of, upper, mesopotamia, that, the, hittites, adopted, the, cuneiform, script, it, took, some, time, before, the, hittites, established, themselves, following, the, collapse, of, the, old, assyrian, empire, in, the, mid, 18th, century, bc, as, is, clear, from, some, of, the, texts, included, here, for, several, centuries, there, were, separate, hittite, groups, usually, centered, on, various, cities, but, then, strong, rulers, with, their, center, in, hattusa, modern, bo, azkale, succeeded, in, bringing, these, together, and, conquering, large, parts, of, central, anatolia, to, establish, the, hittite, kingdom, the, hittite, state, was, formed, from, many, small, polities, in, north, central, anatolia, at, the, banks, of, the, k, z, l, rmak, river, during, the, middle, bronze, age, ca, 1900, 1650, bc, the, early, history, of, the, hittite, kingdom, is, known, through, four, cushion, shaped, tablets, classified, as, kbo, 3, 22, kbo, 17, 21, kbo, 22, 1, and, kbo, 22, 2, not, made, in, attu, a, but, probably, created, in, kussara, n, a, or, another, site, in, anatolia, that, may, first, have, been, written, in, the, 18th, century, bc, in, old, hittite, language, and, three, of, them, using, the, so, called, old, script, os, although, most, of, the, remaining, tablets, survived, only, as, akkadian, copies, made, in, the, 14th, and, 13th, centuries, bc, these, reveal, a, rivalry, within, two, branches, of, the, royal, family, up, to, the, middle, kingdom, a, northern, branch, first, based, in, zalpuwa, and, secondarily, hattusa, and, a, southern, branch, based, in, kussara, still, not, found, and, the, former, assyrian, colony, of, kanesh, these, are, distinguishable, by, their, names, the, northerners, retained, language, isolate, hattian, names, and, the, southerners, adopted, indo, european, hittite, and, luwian, names, zalpuwa, first, attacked, kanesh, under, uhna, in, 1833, bc, and, during, this, k, rum, period, when, the, merchant, colony, of, the, old, assyrian, empire, was, flourishing, in, the, site, and, before, the, conquest, of, pithana, the, following, local, kings, reigned, in, kane, urmili, prior, to, 1790, bc, pa, anu, a, short, time, in, 1790, bc, inar, c, 1790, 1775, bc, and, war, ama, c, 1775, 1750, bc, one, set, of, tablets, known, collectively, as, the, anitta, text, begin, by, telling, how, pithana, the, king, of, kussara, conquered, neighbouring, ne, a, kanesh, this, conquest, took, place, around, 1750, bc, however, the, real, subject, of, these, tablets, is, pithana, s, son, anitta, r, 1745, 1720, bc, who, continued, where, his, father, left, off, and, conquered, several, northern, cities, including, hattusa, which, he, cursed, and, also, zalpuwa, this, was, likely, propaganda, for, the, southern, branch, of, the, royal, family, against, the, northern, branch, who, had, fixed, on, hattusa, as, capital, another, set, the, tale, of, zalpuwa, supports, zalpuwa, and, exonerates, the, later, attu, ili, i, from, the, charge, of, sacking, kanesh, anitta, was, succeeded, by, zuzzu, r, 1720, 1710, bc, but, sometime, in, 1710, 1705, bc, kanesh, was, destroyed, taking, the, long, established, assyrian, merchant, trading, system, with, it, a, kussaran, noble, family, survived, to, contest, the, zalpuwan, hattusan, family, though, whether, these, were, of, the, direct, line, of, anitta, is, uncertain, meanwhile, the, lords, of, zalpa, lived, on, huzziya, i, descendant, of, a, huzziya, of, zalpa, took, over, hatti, his, son, in, law, labarna, i, a, southerner, from, hurma, usurped, the, throne, but, made, sure, to, adopt, huzziya, s, grandson, attu, ili, as, his, own, son, and, heir, the, location, of, the, land, of, hurma, is, believed, to, be, in, the, mountains, south, of, kussara, the, founding, of, the, hittite, kingdom, is, attributed, to, either, labarna, i, or, hattusili, i, the, latter, might, also, have, had, labarna, as, a, personal, name, who, conquered, the, area, south, and, north, of, hattusa, hattusili, i, campaigned, as, far, as, the, semitic, amorite, kingdom, of, yamkhad, in, syria, where, he, attacked, but, did, not, capture, its, capital, of, aleppo, hattusili, i, did, eventually, capture, hattusa, and, was, credited, for, the, foundation, of, the, hittite, empire, hattusili, was, king, and, his, sons, brothers, in, laws, family, members, and, troops, were, all, united, wherever, he, went, on, campaign, he, controlled, the, enemy, land, with, force, he, destroyed, the, lands, one, after, the, other, took, away, their, power, and, made, them, the, borders, of, the, sea, when, he, came, back, from, campaign, however, each, of, his, sons, went, somewhere, to, a, country, and, in, his, hand, the, great, cities, prospered, but, when, later, the, princes, servants, became, corrupt, they, began, to, devour, the, properties, conspired, constantly, against, their, masters, and, began, to, shed, their, blood, this, excerpt, from, the, edict, of, telepinu, dating, to, the, 16th, century, bc, is, supposed, to, illustrate, the, unification, growth, and, prosperity, of, the, hittites, under, his, rule, it, also, illustrates, the, corruption, of, the, princes, believed, to, be, his, sons, the, lack, of, sources, leads, to, uncertainty, of, how, the, corruption, was, addressed, on, hattusili, i, s, deathbed, he, chose, his, grandson, mursili, i, or, murshilish, i, as, his, heir, mursili, continued, the, conquests, of, hattusili, i, in, 1595, bc, middle, chronology, or, 1587, bc, low, middle, chronology, mursili, i, conducted, a, great, raid, down, the, euphrates, river, bypassing, assyria, and, sacking, mari, and, babylon, ejecting, the, amorite, rulers, of, the, old, babylonian, empire, in, the, process, rather, than, incorporate, babylonia, into, hittite, domains, mursili, seems, to, have, instead, turned, control, of, babylonia, over, to, his, kassite, allies, who, were, to, rule, it, for, the, next, four, centuries, due, to, fear, of, revolts, at, home, he, did, not, remain, in, babylon, for, long, this, lengthy, campaign, strained, the, resources, of, hatti, and, left, the, capital, in, a, state, of, near, anarchy, mursili, was, assassinated, by, his, brother, in, law, hantili, i, during, his, journey, back, to, hattusa, or, shortly, after, his, return, home, and, the, hittite, kingdom, was, plunged, into, chaos, hantili, took, the, throne, he, was, able, to, escape, multiple, murder, attempts, on, himself, however, his, family, did, not, his, wife, harapsili, and, her, son, were, murdered, in, addition, other, members, of, the, royal, family, were, killed, by, zidanta, i, who, was, then, murdered, by, his, own, son, ammuna, all, of, the, internal, unrest, among, the, hittite, royal, family, led, to, a, decline, of, power, the, hurrians, a, people, living, in, the, mountainous, region, along, the, upper, tigris, and, euphrates, rivers, in, modern, south, east, turkey, took, advantage, of, the, situation, to, seize, aleppo, and, the, surrounding, areas, for, themselves, as, well, as, the, coastal, region, of, adaniya, renaming, it, kizzuwatna, later, cilicia, throughout, the, remainder, of, the, 16th, century, bc, the, hittite, kings, were, held, to, their, homelands, by, dynastic, quarrels, and, warfare, with, the, hurrians, the, hurrians, became, the, center, of, power, in, anatolia, the, campaigns, into, amurru, and, southern, mesopotamia, may, be, responsible, for, the, reintroduction, of, cuneiform, writing, into, anatolia, since, the, hittite, script, is, quite, different, from, that, of, the, preceding, assyrian, colonial, period, the, hittites, entered, a, weak, phase, of, obscure, records, insignificant, rulers, and, reduced, domains, this, pattern, of, expansion, under, strong, kings, followed, by, contraction, under, weaker, ones, was, to, be, repeated, over, and, over, through, the, hittite, kingdom, s, 500, year, history, making, events, during, the, waning, periods, difficult, to, reconstruct, the, political, instability, of, these, years, of, the, old, hittite, kingdom, can, be, explained, in, part, by, the, nature, of, the, hittite, kingship, at, that, time, during, the, old, hittite, kingdom, prior, to, 1400, bc, the, king, of, the, hittites, was, not, viewed, by, his, subjects, as, a, living, god, like, the, pharaohs, of, egypt, but, rather, as, a, first, among, equals, only, in, the, later, period, from, 1400, bc, until, 1200, bc, did, the, hittite, kingship, become, more, centralized, and, powerful, also, in, earlier, years, the, succession, was, not, legally, fixed, enabling, war, of, the, roses, style, rivalries, between, northern, and, southern, branches, the, next, monarch, of, note, following, mursili, i, was, telepinu, c, 1500, bc, who, won, a, few, victories, to, the, southwest, apparently, by, allying, himself, with, one, hurrian, state, kizzuwatna, against, another, mitanni, telepinu, also, attempted, to, secure, the, lines, of, succession, the, last, monarch, of, the, old, kingdom, telepinu, reigned, until, about, 1500, bc, telepinu, s, reign, marked, the, end, of, the, old, kingdom, and, the, beginning, of, the, lengthy, weak, phase, known, as, the, middle, kingdom, the, period, of, the, 15th, century, bc, is, largely, unknown, with, few, surviving, records, part, of, the, reason, for, both, the, weakness, and, the, obscurity, is, that, the, hittites, were, under, constant, attack, mainly, from, the, kaskians, a, non, indo, european, people, settled, along, the, shores, of, the, black, sea, the, capital, once, again, went, on, the, move, first, to, sapinuwa, and, then, to, samuha, there, is, an, archive, in, sapinuwa, but, it, has, not, been, adequately, translated, to, date, it, segues, into, the, hittite, empire, period, proper, which, dates, from, the, reign, of, tudhaliya, i, from, c, 1430, bc, one, innovation, that, can, be, credited, to, these, early, hittite, rulers, is, the, practice, of, conducting, treaties, and, alliances, with, neighboring, states, the, hittites, were, thus, among, the, earliest, known, pioneers, in, the, art, of, international, politics, and, diplomacy, this, is, also, when, the, hittite, religion, adopted, several, gods, and, rituals, from, the, hurrians, with, the, reign, of, tudhaliya, i, who, may, actually, not, have, been, the, first, of, that, name, see, also, tudhaliya, the, hittite, kingdom, re, emerged, from, the, fog, of, obscurity, and, entered, the, hittite, empire, period, many, changes, were, afoot, during, this, time, not, the, least, of, which, was, a, strengthening, of, the, kingship, settlement, of, the, hittites, progressed, in, the, empire, period, however, the, hittite, people, tended, to, settle, in, the, older, lands, of, south, anatolia, rather, than, the, lands, of, the, aegean, as, this, settlement, progressed, treaties, were, signed, with, neighboring, peoples, during, the, hittite, empire, period, the, kingship, became, hereditary, and, the, king, took, on, a, superhuman, aura, and, began, to, be, referred, to, by, the, hittite, citizens, as, my, sun, the, kings, of, the, empire, period, began, acting, as, a, high, priest, for, the, whole, kingdom, making, an, annual, tour, of, the, hittite, holy, cities, conducting, festivals, and, supervising, the, upkeep, of, the, sanctuaries, during, his, reign, c, 1400, bc, king, tudhaliya, i, again, allied, with, kizzuwatna, then, vanquished, the, hurrian, states, of, aleppo, and, mitanni, and, expanded, to, the, west, at, the, expense, of, arzawa, a, luwian, state, another, weak, phase, followed, tudhaliya, i, and, the, hittites, enemies, from, all, directions, were, able, to, advance, even, to, hattusa, and, raze, it, however, the, kingdom, recovered, its, former, glory, under, uppiluliuma, i, c, 1350, bc, who, again, conquered, aleppo, mitanni, was, reduced, to, vassalage, by, the, assyrians, under, his, son, in, law, and, he, defeated, carchemish, another, amorite, city, state, with, his, own, sons, placed, over, all, of, these, new, conquests, and, babylonia, still, in, the, hands, of, the, allied, kassites, this, left, uppiluliuma, the, supreme, power, broker, in, the, known, world, alongside, assyria, and, egypt, and, it, was, not, long, before, egypt, was, seeking, an, alliance, by, marriage, of, another, of, his, sons, with, the, widow, of, tutankhamen, that, son, was, evidently, murdered, before, reaching, his, destination, and, this, alliance, was, never, consummated, however, the, middle, assyrian, empire, 1365, 1050, bc, once, more, began, to, grow, in, power, with, the, ascension, of, ashur, uballit, i, in, 1365, bc, ashur, uballit, i, attacked, and, defeated, mattiwaza, the, mitanni, king, despite, attempts, by, the, hittite, king, uppiluliuma, i, now, fearful, of, growing, assyrian, power, attempting, to, preserve, his, throne, with, military, support, the, lands, of, the, mitanni, and, hurrians, were, duly, appropriated, by, assyria, enabling, it, to, encroach, on, hittite, territory, in, eastern, asia, minor, and, adad, nirari, i, annexed, carchemish, and, northeast, syria, from, the, control, of, the, hittites, while, uppiluliuma, i, reigned, the, hittite, empire, was, devastated, by, an, epidemic, of, tularemia, the, epidemic, afflicted, the, hittites, for, decades, and, tularemia, killed, uppiluliuma, i, and, his, successor, arnuwanda, ii, after, uppiluliuma, i, s, rule, and, the, brief, reign, of, his, eldest, son, arnuwanda, ii, another, son, mursili, ii, became, king, c, 1330, bc, having, inherited, a, position, of, strength, in, the, east, mursili, was, able, to, turn, his, attention, to, the, west, where, he, attacked, arzawa, at, a, point, when, the, hittites, were, weakened, by, the, tularemia, epidemic, the, arzawans, attacked, the, hittites, who, repelled, the, attack, by, sending, infected, rams, to, the, arzawans, this, was, the, first, recorded, use, of, biological, warfare, mursili, also, attacked, a, city, known, as, millawanda, miletus, which, was, under, the, control, of, ahhiyawa, more, recent, research, based, on, new, readings, and, interpretations, of, the, hittite, texts, as, well, as, of, the, material, evidence, for, mycenaean, contacts, with, the, anatolian, mainland, came, to, the, conclusion, that, ahhiyawa, referred, to, mycenaean, greece, or, at, least, to, a, part, of, it, hittite, prosperity, was, mostly, dependent, on, control, of, the, trade, routes, and, metal, sources, because, of, the, importance, of, northern, syria, to, the, vital, routes, linking, the, cilician, gates, with, mesopotamia, defense, of, this, area, was, crucial, and, was, soon, put, to, the, test, by, egyptian, expansion, under, pharaoh, ramesses, ii, the, outcome, of, the, battle, of, kadesh, is, uncertain, though, it, seems, that, the, timely, arrival, of, egyptian, reinforcements, prevented, total, hittite, victory, the, egyptians, forced, the, hittites, to, take, refuge, in, the, fortress, of, kadesh, but, their, own, losses, prevented, them, from, sustaining, a, siege, this, battle, took, place, in, the, 5th, year, of, ramesses, c, 1274, bc, by, the, most, commonly, used, chronology, after, this, date, the, power, of, both, the, hittites, and, egyptians, began, to, decline, yet, again, because, of, the, power, of, the, assyrians, the, assyrian, king, shalmaneser, i, had, seized, the, opportunity, to, vanquish, hurria, and, mitanni, occupy, their, lands, and, expand, up, to, the, head, of, the, euphrates, while, muwatalli, was, preoccupied, with, the, egyptians, the, hittites, had, vainly, tried, to, preserve, the, mitanni, kingdom, with, military, support, assyria, now, posed, just, as, great, a, threat, to, hittite, trade, routes, as, egypt, ever, had, muwatalli, s, son, urhi, teshub, took, the, throne, and, ruled, as, king, for, seven, years, as, mursili, iii, before, being, ousted, by, his, uncle, hattusili, iii, after, a, brief, civil, war, in, response, to, increasing, assyrian, annexation, of, hittite, territory, he, concluded, a, peace, and, alliance, with, ramesses, ii, also, fearful, of, assyria, presenting, his, daughter, s, hand, in, marriage, to, the, pharaoh, the, treaty, of, kadesh, one, of, the, oldest, completely, surviving, treaties, in, history, fixed, their, mutual, boundaries, in, southern, canaan, and, was, signed, in, the, 21st, year, of, rameses, c, 1258, bc, terms, of, this, treaty, included, the, marriage, of, one, of, the, hittite, princesses, to, ramesses, hattusili, s, son, tudhaliya, iv, was, the, last, strong, hittite, king, able, to, keep, the, assyrians, out, of, the, hittite, heartland, to, some, degree, at, least, though, he, too, lost, much, territory, to, them, and, was, heavily, defeated, by, tukulti, ninurta, i, of, assyria, in, the, battle, of, nihriya, he, even, temporarily, annexed, the, island, of, cyprus, before, that, too, fell, to, assyria, the, last, king, uppiluliuma, ii, also, managed, to, win, some, victories, including, a, naval, battle, against, alashiya, off, the, coast, of, cyprus, but, the, assyrians, under, ashur, resh, ishi, i, had, by, this, time, annexed, much, hittite, territory, in, asia, minor, and, syria, driving, out, and, defeating, the, babylonian, king, nebuchadnezzar, i, in, the, process, who, also, had, eyes, on, hittite, lands, the, sea, peoples, had, already, begun, their, push, down, the, mediterranean, coastline, starting, from, the, aegean, and, continuing, all, the, way, to, canaan, founding, the, state, of, philistia, taking, cilicia, and, cyprus, away, from, the, hittites, en, route, and, cutting, off, their, coveted, trade, routes, this, left, the, hittite, homelands, vulnerable, to, attack, from, all, directions, and, hattusa, was, burnt, to, the, ground, sometime, around, 1180, bc, following, a, combined, onslaught, from, new, waves, of, invaders, the, kaskians, phrygians, and, bryges, the, hittite, kingdom, thus, vanished, from, historical, records, much, of, the, territory, being, seized, by, assyria, alongside, with, these, attacks, many, internal, issues, also, led, to, the, end, of, the, hittite, kingdom, the, end, of, the, kingdom, was, part, of, the, larger, bronze, age, collapse, a, study, of, tree, rings, of, juniper, trees, growing, in, the, region, showed, a, change, to, drier, conditions, from, the, 13th, century, bc, into, the, 12th, century, bc, with, drought, for, three, consecutive, years, in, 1198, 1197, and, 1196, bc, by, 1160, bc, the, political, situation, in, asia, minor, looked, vastly, different, from, that, of, only, 25, years, earlier, in, that, year, the, assyrian, king, tiglath, pileser, i, was, defeating, the, mushki, phrygians, who, had, been, attempting, to, press, into, assyrian, colonies, in, southern, anatolia, from, the, anatolian, highlands, and, the, kaska, people, the, hittites, old, enemies, from, the, northern, hill, country, between, hatti, and, the, black, sea, seem, to, have, joined, them, soon, after, the, phrygians, had, apparently, overrun, cappadocia, from, the, west, with, recently, discovered, epigraphic, evidence, confirming, their, origins, as, the, balkan, bryges, tribe, forced, out, by, the, macedonians, although, the, hittite, kingdom, disappeared, from, anatolia, at, this, point, there, emerged, a, number, of, so, called, syro, hittite, states, in, anatolia, and, northern, syria, they, were, the, successors, of, the, hittite, kingdom, the, most, notable, syro, hittite, kingdoms, were, those, at, carchemish, and, melid, with, the, ruling, family, in, carchemish, believed, to, have, been, a, cadet, branch, of, the, then, defunct, central, ruling, hittite, line, these, syro, hittite, states, gradually, fell, under, the, control, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, 911, 608, bc, carchemish, and, melid, were, made, vassals, of, assyria, under, shalmaneser, iii, 858, 823, bc, and, fully, incorporated, into, assyria, during, the, reign, of, sargon, ii, 722, 705, bc, a, large, and, powerful, state, known, as, tabal, occupied, much, of, southern, anatolia, known, as, greek, tibarenoi, ancient, greek, latin, tibareni, thobeles, in, josephus, their, language, may, have, been, luwian, testified, to, by, monuments, written, using, anatolian, hieroglyphs, this, state, too, was, conquered, and, incorporated, into, the, vast, neo, assyrian, empire, ultimately, both, luwian, hieroglyphs, and, cuneiform, were, rendered, obsolete, by, an, innovation, the, alphabet, which, seems, to, have, entered, anatolia, simultaneously, from, the, aegean, with, the, bryges, who, changed, their, name, to, phrygians, and, from, the, phoenicians, and, neighboring, peoples, in, syria, the, earliest, known, constitutional, monarchy, was, developed, by, the, hittites, the, head, of, the, hittite, state, was, the, king, followed, by, the, heir, apparent, the, king, was, the, supreme, ruler, of, the, land, in, charge, of, being, a, military, commander, judicial, authority, as, well, as, a, high, priest, however, some, officials, exercised, independent, authority, over, various, branches, of, the, government, one, of, the, most, important, of, these, posts, in, the, hittite, society, was, that, of, the, gal, mesedi, chief, of, the, royal, bodyguards, it, was, superseded, by, the, rank, of, the, gal, gestin, chief, of, the, wine, stewards, who, like, the, gal, mesedi, was, generally, a, member, of, the, royal, family, the, kingdom, s, bureaucracy, was, headed, by, the, gal, dubsar, chief, of, the, scribes, whose, authority, did, not, extend, over, the, lugal, dubsar, the, king, s, personal, scribe, egyptian, monarchs, engaged, in, diplomacy, with, two, chief, hittite, seats, located, at, kadesh, a, city, located, on, the, orontes, river, and, carchemish, located, on, the, euphrates, river, in, southern, anatolia, in, the, central, anatolian, settlement, of, ankuwa, home, of, the, pre, hittite, goddess, kattaha, and, the, worship, of, other, hattic, deities, illustrates, the, ethnic, differences, in, the, areas, the, hittites, tried, to, control, kattaha, was, originally, given, the, name, hannikkun, the, usage, of, the, term, kattaha, over, hannikkun, according, to, ronald, gorny, head, of, the, alisar, regional, project, in, turkey, was, a, device, to, downgrade, the, pre, hittite, identity, of, this, female, deity, and, to, bring, her, more, in, touch, with, the, hittite, tradition, their, reconfiguration, of, gods, throughout, their, early, history, such, as, with, kattaha, was, a, way, of, legitimizing, their, authority, and, to, avoid, conflicting, ideologies, in, newly, included, regions, and, settlements, by, transforming, local, deities, to, fit, their, own, customs, the, hittites, hoped, that, the, traditional, beliefs, of, these, communities, would, understand, and, accept, the, changes, to, become, better, suited, for, the, hittite, political, and, economic, goals, king, telipinu, reigned, c, 1525, c, 1500, bc, is, considered, to, be, the, last, king, of, the, old, kingdom, of, the, hittites, he, seized, power, during, a, dynastic, power, struggle, during, his, reign, he, wanted, to, take, care, of, lawlessness, and, regulate, royal, succession, he, then, issued, the, edict, of, telipinus, in, this, edict, he, designated, the, pankus, which, was, a, general, assembly, as, the, high, court, for, constitutional, crimes, crimes, such, as, murder, were, observed, and, judged, by, the, pankus, kings, themselves, were, also, subject, to, jurisdiction, under, the, pankus, the, pankus, also, served, as, an, advisory, council, for, the, king, the, rules, and, regulations, set, out, by, the, edict, and, the, establishment, of, the, pankus, proved, to, be, very, successful, and, lasted, all, the, way, through, to, end, of, the, new, kingdom, the, pankus, established, a, legal, code, where, violence, was, not, a, punishment, for, a, crime, crimes, such, as, a, murder, and, theft, which, at, the, time, were, punishable, by, death, in, other, southwest, asian, kingdoms, were, not, capital, crimes, under, the, hittite, law, code, most, criminal, penalties, involved, restitution, for, example, in, cases, of, thievery, the, punishment, of, that, crime, would, to, be, to, repay, what, was, stolen, in, equal, value, pontic, steppe, caucasus, east, asia, eastern, europe, northern,

1100, bc, hittite, is, the, best, attested, member, of, the, anatolian, branch, of, the, indo, european, language, family, and, the, indo, european, language, for, which, the, earliest, surviving, written, attestation, exists, with, isolated, hittite, loanwords, and, numerous, personal, names, appearing, in, an, old, assyrian, context, from, as, early, as, the, 20th, century, bc, the, language, of, the, hattusa, tablets, was, eventually, deciphered, by, a, czech, linguist, bed, ich, hrozn, 1879, 1952, who, on, 24, november, 1915, announced, his, results, in, a, lecture, at, the, near, eastern, society, of, berlin, his, book, about, the, discovery, was, printed, in, leipzig, in, 1917, under, the, title, the, language, of, the, hittites, its, structure, and, its, membership, in, the, indo, european, linguistic, family, the, preface, of, the, book, begins, with, the, decipherment, famously, led, to, the, confirmation, of, the, laryngeal, theory, in, indo, european, linguistics, which, had, been, predicted, several, decades, before, due, to, its, marked, differences, in, its, structure, and, phonology, some, early, philologists, most, notably, warren, cowgill, had, even, argued, that, it, should, be, classified, as, a, sister, language, to, indo, european, languages, indo, hittite, rather, than, a, daughter, language, by, the, end, of, the, hittite, empire, the, hittite, language, had, become, a, written, language, of, administration, and, diplomatic, correspondence, the, population, of, most, of, the, hittite, empire, by, this, time, spoke, luwian, another, indo, european, language, of, the, anatolian, family, that, had, originated, to, the, west, of, the, hittite, region, according, to, craig, melchert, the, current, tendency, is, to, suppose, that, proto, indo, european, evolved, and, that, the, prehistoric, speakers, of, anatolian, became, isolated, from, the, rest, of, the, pie, speech, community, so, as, not, to, share, in, some, common, innovations, hittite, as, well, as, its, anatolian, cousins, split, off, from, proto, indo, european, at, an, early, stage, thereby, preserving, archaisms, that, were, later, lost, in, the, other, indo, european, languages, in, hittite, there, are, many, loanwords, particularly, religious, vocabulary, from, the, non, indo, european, hurrian, and, hattic, languages, the, latter, was, the, language, of, the, hattians, the, local, inhabitants, of, the, land, of, hatti, before, being, absorbed, or, displaced, by, the, hittites, sacred, and, magical, texts, from, hattusa, were, often, written, in, hattic, hurrian, and, luwian, even, after, hittite, became, the, norm, for, other, writings, given, the, size, of, the, empire, there, are, relatively, few, remains, of, hittite, art, these, include, some, impressive, monumental, carvings, a, number, of, rock, reliefs, as, well, as, metalwork, in, particular, the, alaca, h, y, k, bronze, standards, carved, ivory, and, ceramics, including, the, h, seyindede, vases, the, sphinx, gates, of, alaca, h, y, k, and, hattusa, with, the, monument, at, the, spring, of, eflatun, p, nar, are, among, the, largest, constructed, sculptures, along, with, a, number, of, large, recumbent, lions, of, which, the, lion, of, babylon, statue, at, babylon, is, the, largest, if, it, is, indeed, hittite, nearly, all, are, notably, worn, rock, reliefs, include, the, hanyeri, relief, and, hemite, relief, the, ni, de, stele, from, the, end, of, the, 8th, century, bc, is, a, luwian, monument, from, the, post, hittite, period, found, in, the, modern, turkish, city, of, ni, de, hittite, religion, and, mythology, were, heavily, influenced, by, their, hattic, mesopotamian, canaanite, and, hurrian, counterparts, in, earlier, times, indo, european, elements, may, still, be, clearly, discerned, storm, gods, were, prominent, in, the, hittite, pantheon, tarhunt, hurrian, s, teshub, was, referred, to, as, the, conqueror, the, king, of, kummiya, king, of, heaven, lord, of, the, land, of, hatti, he, was, chief, among, the, gods, and, his, symbol, is, the, bull, as, teshub, he, was, depicted, as, a, bearded, man, astride, two, mountains, and, bearing, a, club, he, was, the, god, of, battle, and, victory, especially, when, the, conflict, involved, a, foreign, power, teshub, was, also, known, for, his, conflict, with, the, serpent, illuyanka, the, hittite, gods, are, also, honoured, with, festivals, such, as, puruli, in, the, spring, the, nuntarriyashas, festival, in, the, autumn, and, the, ki, lam, festival, of, the, gate, house, where, images, of, the, storm, god, and, up, to, thirty, other, idols, were, paraded, through, the, streets, hittite, laws, much, like, other, records, of, the, empire, are, recorded, on, cuneiform, tablets, made, from, baked, clay, what, is, understood, to, be, the, hittite, law, code, comes, mainly, from, two, clay, tablets, each, containing, 186, articles, and, are, a, collection, of, practiced, laws, from, across, the, early, hittite, kingdom, in, addition, to, the, tablets, monuments, bearing, hittite, cuneiform, inscriptions, can, be, found, in, central, anatolia, describing, the, government, and, law, codes, of, the, empire, the, tablets, and, monuments, date, from, the, old, hittite, kingdom, 1650, 1500, bc, to, what, is, known, as, the, new, hittite, kingdom, 1500, 1180, bc, between, these, time, periods, different, translations, can, be, found, that, modernize, the, language, and, create, a, series, of, legal, reforms, in, which, many, crimes, are, given, more, humane, punishments, these, changes, could, possibly, be, attributed, to, the, rise, of, new, and, different, kings, throughout, the, history, empire, or, to, the, new, translations, that, change, the, language, used, in, the, law, codes, in, either, case, the, law, codes, of, the, hittites, provide, very, specific, fines, or, punishments, that, are, to, be, issued, for, specific, crimes, and, have, many, similarities, to, biblical, laws, found, in, the, books, of, exodus, and, deuteronomy, in, addition, to, criminal, punishments, the, law, codes, also, provide, instruction, on, certain, situations, such, as, inheritance, and, death, the, law, articles, used, by, the, hittites, most, often, outline, very, specific, crimes, or, offenses, either, against, the, state, or, against, other, individuals, and, provide, a, sentence, for, these, offenses, the, laws, carved, in, the, tablets, are, an, assembly, of, established, social, conventions, from, across, the, empire, hittite, laws, at, this, time, have, a, prominent, lack, of, equality, in, punishments, in, many, cases, distinct, punishments, or, compensations, for, men, and, women, are, listed, free, men, most, often, received, more, compensation, for, offenses, against, them, than, free, women, did, slaves, male, or, female, had, very, few, rights, and, could, easily, be, punished, or, executed, by, their, masters, for, crimes, most, articles, describe, destruction, of, property, and, personal, injury, to, which, the, most, common, sentence, was, payment, for, compensation, of, the, lost, property, again, in, these, cases, men, oftentimes, receive, a, greater, amount, of, compensation, than, women, other, articles, describe, how, marriage, of, slaves, and, free, individuals, should, be, handled, in, any, case, of, separation, or, estrangement, the, free, individual, male, or, female, would, keep, all, but, one, child, that, resulted, from, the, marriage, cases, in, which, capital, punishment, is, recommended, in, the, articles, most, often, seem, to, come, from, pre, reform, sentences, for, severe, crimes, and, prohibited, sexual, pairings, many, of, these, cases, include, public, torture, and, execution, as, punishment, for, serious, crimes, against, religion, most, of, these, sentences, would, begin, to, go, away, in, the, later, stages, of, the, hittite, empire, as, major, law, reforms, began, to, occur, while, different, translations, of, laws, can, be, seen, throughout, the, history, of, the, empire, the, hittite, outlook, of, law, was, originally, founded, on, religion, and, were, intended, to, preserve, the, authority, of, the, state, additionally, punishments, had, the, goal, of, crime, prevention, and, the, protection, of, individual, property, rights, the, goals, of, crime, prevention, can, be, seen, in, the, severity, of, the, punishments, issued, for, certain, crimes, capital, punishment, and, torture, are, specifically, mentioned, as, punishment, for, more, severe, crimes, against, religion, and, harsh, fines, for, the, loss, of, private, property, or, life, the, tablets, also, describe, the, ability, of, the, king, to, pardon, certain, crimes, but, specifically, prohibit, an, individual, being, pardoned, for, murder, at, some, point, in, the, 16th, or, 15th, century, bc, hittite, law, codes, move, away, from, torture, and, capital, punishment, and, to, more, humanitarian, forms, of, punishments, such, as, fines, where, the, old, law, system, was, based, on, retaliation, and, retribution, for, crimes, the, new, system, saw, punishments, that, were, much, more, mild, favoring, monetary, compensation, over, physical, or, capital, punishment, why, these, drastic, reforms, happened, is, not, exactly, clear, but, it, is, likely, that, punishing, murder, with, execution, was, deemed, not, to, benefit, any, individual, or, family, involved, these, reforms, were, not, just, seen, in, the, realm, of, capital, punishment, where, major, fines, were, to, be, paid, a, severe, reduction, in, penalty, can, be, seen, for, example, prior, to, these, major, reforms, the, payment, to, be, made, for, the, theft, of, an, animal, was, thirty, times, the, animal, s, value, after, the, reforms, the, penalty, was, reduced, to, half, the, original, fine, simultaneously, attempts, to, modernize, the, language, and, change, the, verbiage, used, in, the, law, codes, can, be, seen, during, this, period, of, reform, under, both, the, old, and, reformed, hittite, law, codes, three, main, types, of, punishment, can, be, seen, death, torture, or, compensation, fines, the, articles, outlined, on, the, cuneiform, tablets, provide, very, specific, punishments, for, crimes, committed, against, the, hittite, religion, or, against, individuals, in,

with, animals, step, family, relatives, of, spouses, or, concubines, many, of, these, articles, do, not, provide, specific, punishments, but, prior, to, the, law, reforms, crimes, against, religion, were, most, often, punishable, by, death, these, include, incestuous, marriages, and, sexual, relations, with, certain, animals, for, example, one, article, states, if, a, man, has, sexual, relations,

acts, of, the, gods, if, an, animal, were, to, die, by, certain, circumstances, the, individual, could, claim, that, it, died, by, the, hand, of, a, god, swearing, that, what, they, claim, was, true, it, seems, that, they, were, exempt, from, paying, compensation, to, the, animal, s, owner, injuries, inflicted, upon, animals, owned, by, another, individual, are, almost, always, compensated, with, either, direct, payment, or, trading, the, injured, animal, with, a, healthy, one, owned, by, the, offender, not, all, laws, prescribed, in, the, tablets, deal, with, criminal, punishment, for,
