sudan, is, geographically, part, of, a, larger, african, region, also, known, by, the, term, sudan, the, term, is, derived, from, arabic, bil, d, as, s, d, n, or, land, of, the, black, people, and, has, sometimes, been, used, more, widely, referring, to, the, sahel, belt, of, west, and, central, africa, the, modern, republic, of, the, sudan, was, formed, in, early, 1956, and, inherited, its, boundaries, from, anglo, egyptian, sudan, established, in, 1899, for, times, predating, 1899, usage, of, the, term, sudan, mainly, applied, to, the, turkish, sudan, and, the, mahdist, state, and, a, wider, and, changing, territory, between, egypt, in, the, north, and, regions, in, the, south, adjacent, to, modern, uganda, kenya, and, ethiopia, the, early, history, of, the, kingdom, of, kush, located, along, the, nile, region, in, northern, sudan, is, intertwined, with, the, history, of, ancient, egypt, with, which, it, was, politically, allied, over, several, regnal, eras, by, virtue, of, its, proximity, to, egypt, sudan, participated, in, the, wider, history, of, the, near, east, with, the, important, 25th, dynasty, of, egypt, and, the, christianization, of, the, three, nubian, kingdoms, nobatia, makuria, and, alodia, in, the, sixth, century, as, a, result, of, christianization, the, old, nubian, language, stands, as, the, oldest, recorded, nilo, saharan, language, earliest, records, dating, to, the, eighth, century, in, an, adaptation, of, the, coptic, alphabet, while, islam, was, already, present, on, the, sudanese, red, sea, coast, and, the, adjacent, territories, since, the, 7th, century, the, nile, valley, did, not, undergo, islamization, until, the, 14th, 15th, century, following, the, decline, of, the, christian, kingdoms, these, kingdoms, were, succeeded, by, the, sultanate, of, sennar, in, the, early, 16th, century, which, controlled, large, parts, of, the, nile, valley, and, the, eastern, desert, while, the, kingdoms, of, darfur, controlled, the, western, part, of, sudan, two, small, kingdoms, arose, in, the, southern, regions, the, shilluk, kingdom, of, 1490, and, taqali, of, 1750, near, modern, day, south, sudan, but, both, northern, and, southern, regions, were, seized, by, muhammad, ali, of, egypt, during, the, 1820s, the, oppressive, rule, of, muhammad, ali, and, his, immediate, successors, is, credited, for, stirring, up, resentment, against, the, turco, egyptian, and, british, rulers, and, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, mahdist, state, founded, by, muhammad, ahmad, in, 1881, since, independence, in, 1956, the, history, of, sudan, has, been, tarnished, by, internal, conflict, including, the, first, sudanese, civil, war, 1955, 1972, the, second, sudanese, civil, war, 1983, 2005, the, war, in, darfur, 2003, 2020, culminating, in, the, secession, of, south, sudan, on, 9, july, 2011, after, which, the, south, sudanese, civil, war, took, place, therein, 2013, 2020, and, the, current, sudanese, civil, war,

gathering, and, cattle, herding, during, the, fifth, millennium, bc, migrations, from, the, drying, sahara, brought, neolithic, people, into, the, nile, valley, along, with, agriculture, the, population, that, resulted, from, this, cultural, and, genetic, mixing, developed, a, social, hierarchy, over, the, next, centuries, and, became, the, kingdom, of, kush, with, the, capital, at, kerma, around, 1070, bc, anthropological, and, archaeological, research, indicates, that, during, the, pre, dynastic, period, lower, nubia, and, magadan, upper, egypt, were, ethnically, and, culturally, nearly, identical, and, thus, simultaneously, evolved, systems, of, pharaonic, kingship, by, 3300, bc, together, with, other, countries, on, red, sea, sudan, is, considered, the, most, likely,

egypt, constructed, a, network, of, forts, along, the, nile, as, far, south, as, samnah, in, lower, egypt, to, guard, the, flow, of, gold, from, mines, in, wawat, the, area, between, the, first, and, second, cataracts, around, 1720, bc, canaanite, nomads, called, the, hyksos, took, over, egypt, ended, the, middle, kingdom, severed, links, with, kush, and, destroyed, the, forts, along, the, nile, river, to, fill, the, vacuum, left, by, the, egyptian, withdrawal, a, culturally, distinct, indigenous, kushite, kingdom, emerged, at, kerma, near, present, day, dongola, after, egyptian, power, revived, during, the, new, kingdom, c, 1570, 1100, bc, the, pharaoh, ahmose, i, incorporated, kush, as, an, egyptian, ruled, province, governed, by, a, viceroy, although, egypt, s, administrative,

foreign, domination, the, kushite, elite, regarded, themselves, as, central, powers, and, believed, themselves, as, idols, of, egyptian, culture, and, religion, by, the, 11th, century, bc, the, authority, of, the, new, kingdom, dynasties, had, diminished, allowing, divided, rule, in, egypt, and, ending, egyptian, control, of, kush, with, the, withdrawal, of, the, egyptians, there, ceased, to, be, any, written, record, or, information, from, kush, about, the, region, s, activities, over, the, next, three, hundred, years, in, the, early, eighth, century, bc, however, kush, emerged, as, an, independent, kingdom, ruled, from, napata, by, an, aggressive, line, of, monarchs, who, slowly, extended, their, influence, into, egypt, around, 750, bc, a, kushite, king, called, kashta, conquered, upper, egypt, and, became, ruler, of, thebes, until, approximately, 740, bc, his, successor, piye, subdued, the, nile, delta, and, conquered, egypt, thus, initiating, the, twenty, fifth, dynasty, piye, founded, a, line, of, kings, who, ruled, kush, and, thebes, for, about, a, hundred, years, the, dynasty, s, interference, with, assyria, s, sphere, of, influence, in, the, near, east, caused, a, confrontation, between, egypt, and, the, powerful, assyrian, state, which, controlled, a, vast, empire, comprising, much, of, the, middle, east, anatolia, caucasus, and, the, eastern, mediterranean, basin, from, their, homeland, in, upper, mesopotamia, taharqa, 688, 663, bc, the, last, kushite, pharaoh, was, defeated, and, driven, out, of, the, near, east, by, sennacherib, of, assyria, sennacherib, s, successor, esarhaddon, went, further, launching, a, full, scale, invasion, of, egypt, in, 674, bc, defeating, taharqa, and, quickly, conquering, the, land, taharqa, fled, back, to, nubia, and, native, egyptian, princes, were, installed, by, the, assyrians, as, vassals, of, esarhaddon, however, taharqa, was, able, to, return, some, years, later, and, wrest, back, control, of, a, part, of, egypt, as, far, as, thebes, from, the, egyptian, vassal, princes, of, assyria, esarhaddon, died, in, his, capital, nineveh, while, preparing, to, return, to, egypt, and, once, more, eject, the, kushites, esarhaddon, s, successor, ashurbanipal, sent, a, general, with, a, small, army, which, again, defeated, and, ejected, taharqa, from, egypt, taharqa, died, in, nubia, two, years, later, his, successor, tantamani, attempted, to, regain, egypt, he, successfully, defeated, necho, i, the, puppet, ruler, installed, by, ashurbanipal, taking, thebes, in, the, process, the, assyrians, then, sent, a, powerful, army, southwards, tantamani, was, heavily, routed, and, the, assyrian, army, sacked, thebes, to, such, an, extent, it, never, truly, recovered, a, native, ruler, psamtik, i, was, placed, on, the, throne, as, a, vassal, of, ashurbanipal, thus, ending, the, kushite, nubian, empire, egypt, s, succeeding, dynasty, failed, to, reassert, full, control, over, kush, around, 590, bc, however, an, egyptian, army, sacked, napata, compelling, the, kushite, court, to, move, to, a, more, secure, location, further, south, at, mero, near, the, sixth, cataract, for, several, centuries, thereafter, the, meroitic, kingdom, developed, independently, of, egyptian, influence, and, domination, which, passed, successively, under, iranian, greek, and, finally, roman, domination, during, the, height, of, its, power, in, the, second, and, third, centuries, bc, mero, extended, over, a, region, from, the, third, cataract, in, the, north, to, soba, near, present, day,

erected, nubian, pyramids, to, contain, their, tombs, these, objects, and, the, ruins, of, palaces, temples, and, baths, at, mero, attest, to, a, centralized, political, system, that, employed, artisans, skills, and, commanded, the, labour, of, a, large, work, force, a, well, managed, irrigation, system, allowed, the, area, to, support, a, higher, population, density, than, was, possible,

warriors, who, sold, their, skills, to, mero, for, protection, eventually, they, intermarried, and, established, themselves, among, the, meroitic, people, as, a, military, aristocracy, until, nearly, the, fifth, century, rome, subsidized, the, nobatia, and, used, mero, as, a, buffer, between, egypt, and, the, blemmyes, meanwhile, the, old, meroitic, kingdom, contracted, because, of, the, expansion, of, the, powerful, kingdom, of, aksum, to, the, east, by, 350, king, ezana, of, axum, had, captured, and, destroyed, the, capital, of, mero, ending, the, kingdom, s, independent, existence, and, conquering, its, territory, on, the, turn, of, the, fifth, century, the, blemmyes, established, a, short, lived, state, in, upper, egypt, and, lower, nubia, probably, centered, around, talmis, kalabsha, but, before, 450, they, were, already, driven, out, of, the, nile, valley, by, the, nobatians, the, latter, eventually, founded, a, kingdom, on, their, own, nobatia, by, the, 6th, century, there, were, in, total, three, nubian, kingdoms, nobatia, in, the, north, which, had, its, capital, at, pachoras, faras, the, central, kingdom, makuria, centred, at, tungul, old, dongola, about, 13, kilometres, 8, miles, south, of, modern, dongola, and, alodia, in, the, heartland, of, the, old, kushitic, kingdom, which, had, its, capital, at, soba, now, a, suburb, of, modern, day, khartoum, still, in, the, sixth, century, they, converted, to, christianity, in, the, seventh, century, probably, at, some, point, between, 628, and, 642, nobatia, was, incorporated, into, makuria, between, 639, and, 641, the, muslim, arabs, of, the, rashidun, caliphate, conquered, byzantine, egypt, in, 641, or, 642, and, again, in, 652, they, invaded, nubia, but, were, repelled, making, the, nubians, one, of, the, few, who, managed, to, defeat, the, arabs, during, the, islamic, expansion, afterwards, the, makurian, king, and, the, arabs, agreed, on, the, baqt, a, unique, non, aggression, pact, that, also, included, an, annual, exchange, of, gifts, thus, acknowledging, makuria, s, independence, while, the, arabs, failed, to, conquer, nubia, they, began, to, settle, east, of, the, nile, where, they, eventually, founded, several, port, towns, and, intermarried, with, the, local, beja, from, the, mid, 8th, mid, 11th, century, christian, nubia, went, through, its, golden, age, when, its, political, power, and, cultural, development, peaked, in, 747, makuria, invaded, egypt, which, at, this, time, belonged, to, the, declining, umayyads, and, it, did, so, again, in, the, early, 960s, when, it, pushed, as, far, north, as, akhmim, makuria, maintained, close, dynastic, ties, with, alodia, perhaps, resulting, in, the, temporary, unification, of, the, two, kingdoms, into, one, state, the, culture, of, the, medieval, nubians, has, been, described, as, afro, byzantine, with, the, significance, of, the, african, component, increasing, over, time, increasing, arab, influence,

was, in, decline, and, alodia, s, capital, declined, in, the, 12th, century, as, well, in, the, 14th, the, earliest, recorded, migration, from, egypt, to, the, sudanese, nile, valley, dates, to, 1324, and, 15th, century, bedouin, tribes, overran, most, of, sudan, migrating, to, the, butana, the, gezira, kordofan, and, darfur, in, 1365, a, civil, war, forced, the, makurian, court, to, flee, to, gebel, adda, in, lower, nubia, while, dongola, was, destroyed, and, left, to, the, arabs, afterwards, makuria, continued, to, exist, as, a, rump, state, the, last, known, makurian, king, was, joel, who, is, attested, for, the, years, 1463, and, 1484, and, under, whom, makuria, probably, witnessed, a, brief, renaissance, after, his, death, the, kingdom, probably, collapsed, to, the, south, the, kingdom, of, alodia, fell, to, either, the, arabs, commanded, by, tribal, leader, abdallah, jamma, or, the, funj, an, african, people, originating, from, the, south, datings, range, from, the, 9th, century, after, the, hijra, c, 1396, 1494, the, late, 15th, century, 1504, to, 1509, an, alodian, rump, state, might, have, survived, in, the, form, of, the, kingdom, of, fazughli, lasting, until, 1685, in, 1504, the, funj, are, recorded, to, have, founded, the, kingdom, of, sennar, in, which, abdallah, jamma, s, realm, was, incorporated, by, 1523, when, jewish, traveller, david, reubeni, visited, sudan, the, funj, state, already, extended, as, far, north, as, dongola, meanwhile, islam, began, to, be, preached, on, the, nile, by, sufi, holymen, who, settled, there, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, and, by, david, reubeni, s, visit, king, amara, dunqas, previously, a, pagan, or, nominal, christian, was, recorded, to, be, muslim, however, the, funj, would, retain, un, islamic, customs, like, the, divine, kingship, and, the, consummation, of, alcohol, until, the, 18th, century, sudanese, folk, islam, preserved, many, rituals, stemming, from, christian, traditions, until, the, recent, past, soon, the, funj, came, in, conflict, with, the, ottomans, who, had, occupied, suakin, around, 1526, and, eventually, pushed, south, along, the, nile, reaching, the, third, nile, cataract, area, in, 1583, 1584, a, subsequent, ottoman, attempt, to, capture, dongola, was, repelled, by, the, funj, in, 1585, afterwards, hannik, located, just, south, of, the, third, cataract, would, mark, the, border, between, the, two, states, the, aftermath, of, the, ottoman, invasion, saw, the, attempted, usurpation, of, ajib, a, minor, king, of, northern, nubia, while, the, funj, eventually, killed, him, in, 1611, 1612, his, successors, the, abdallab, were, granted, the, authority, to, govern, everything, north, of, the, confluence, of, blue, and, white, niles, with, considerable, autonomy, during, the, 17th, century, the, funj, state, reached, its, widest, extend, but, in, the, following, century, it, began, to, decline, a, coup, in, 1718, brought, a, dynastic, change, while, another, one, in, 1761, 1762, resulted, in, the, hamaj, regency, where, the, hamaj, a, people, from, the, ethiopian, borderlands, effectively, ruled, while, the, funj, sultans, were, their, puppets, shortly, afterwards, the, sultanate, began, to, fragment, by, the, early, 19th, century, it, was, essentially, restricted, to, the, gezira, the, coup, of, 1718, kicked, off, a, policy, of, pursuing, a, more, orthodox, islam, which, in, turn, promoted, the, arabization, of, the, state, in, order, to, legitimize, their, rule, over, their, arab, subjects, the, funj, began, to, propagate, an, umayyad, descend, north, of, the, confluence, of, the, blue, and, white, niles, as, far, downstream, as, al, dabbah, the, nubians, would, adopt, the, tribal, identity, of, the, arab,

period, saw, at, first, the, rise, of, the, tunjur, kingdom, which, replaced, the, old, daju, kingdom, in, the, 15th, century, and, extended, as, far, west, as, wadai, the, tunjur, people, were, probably, arabized, berbers, and, their, ruling, elite, at, least, muslims, in, the, 17th, century, the, tunjur, were, driven, from, power, by, the, fur, keira, sultanate, the, keira, state, nominally, muslim, since, the, reign, of, sulayman, solong, r, c, 1660, 1680, was, initially, a, small, kingdom, in, northern, jebel, marra, but, expanded, west, and, northwards, in, the, early, 18th, century, and, eastwards, under, the, rule, of, muhammad, tayrab, r, 1751, 1786, peaking, in, the, conquest, of, kordofan, in, 1785, the, apogee, of, this, empire, now, roughly, the, size, of, present, day, nigeria, would, last, until, 1821, from, 1805, egypt, underwent, a, period, of, rapid, modernisation, under, muhammad, ali, pasha, who, declared, himself, khedive, in, defiance, of, his, nominal, suzerain, the, ottoman, sultan, within, a, matter, of, decades, muhammad, ali, transformed, egypt, from, a, neglected, ottoman, province, to, being, virtually, independent, replicating, the, approach, of, his, mamluk, predecessors, in, the, medieval, sultanate, of, egypt, muhammad, ali, sought, to, expand, egypt, s, frontiers, southwards, into, sudan, both, as, a, means, of, guaranteeing, egypt, s, security, and, to, gain, access, to, sudan, s, natural, resources, between, 1820, and, 1821, egyptian, forces, under, the, command, of, muhammad, ali, s, son, conquered, and, unified, the, northern,

and, infrastructure, of, the, north, southern, political, arrangements, were, left, largely, as, they, had, been, prior, to, the, arrival, of, the, british, until, the, 1920s, the, british, had,

under, one, government, the, south, sudanese, authorities, were, informed, at, the, juba, conference, of, 1947, that, they, would, in, future, be, governed, by, a, common, administrative, authority, with, the, north, from, 1948, 13, delegates, nominated, by, the, british, authorities, represented, the, south, on, the, sudan, legislative, assembly, many, southerners, felt, betrayed, by, the, british, because, they, were, largely, excluded, from, the, new, government, the, language, of, the, new, government, was, arabic, but, the, bureaucrats, and, politicians, from, southern, sudan, had, for, the, most, part, been, trained, in, english, of, the, eight, hundred, new, governmental, positions, vacated, by, the, british, in, 1953, only, four, were, given, to, southerners, also, the, political, structure, in, the, south, was, not, as, organized, in, the, north, so, political, groupings, and, parties, from, the, south, were, not, represented, at, the, various, conferences, and, talks, that, established, the, modern, state, of, sudan, as, a, result, many, southerners, did, not, consider, sudan, to, be, a, legitimate, state, on, 12, february, 1953, the, united, kingdom, and,

however, the, arab, led, khartoum, government, ignored, their, promises, to, southerners, to, create, a, federal, system, which, led, to, a, mutiny, by, southern, army, officers, that, sparked, seventeen, years, of, civil, war, 1955, 1972, in, the, early, period, of, the, war, hundreds, of, northern, bureaucrats, teachers, and, other, officials, serving, in, the, south, were, massacred, the,

parliamentary, government, in, a, bloodless, coup, d, tat, gen, abboud, did, not, carry, out, his, promises, to, return, sudan, to, civilian, government, however, and, popular, resentment, against,

until, parliamentary, elections, in, april, 1965, led, to, a, coalition, government, of, the, umma, and, national, unionist, parties, under, prime, minister, muhammad, ahmad, mahjoub, between, 1966, and, 1969, sudan, had, a, series, of, governments, that, proved, unable, either, to, agree, on, a, permanent, constitution, or, to, cope, with, problems, of, factionalism, economic, stagnation, and, ethnic, dissidence, the, succession, of, early, post, independence, governments, were, dominated, by, arab, muslims, who, viewed, sudan, as, a, muslim, arab, state, indeed, the, umma, nup, proposed,

power, in, 1972, the, addis, ababa, agreement, led, to, a, cessation, of, the, north, south, civil, war, and, a, degree, of, self, rule, this, led, to, a, ten, years, hiatus, in, the, civil, war, until, the, early, 1970s, sudan, s, agricultural, output, was, mostly, dedicated, to, internal, consumption, in, 1972, the, sudanese, government, became, more, pro, western, and, made, plans, to, export, food, and, cash, crops, however, commodity, prices, declined, throughout, the, 1970s, causing, economic, problems, for, sudan, at, the, same, time, debt, servicing, costs, from, the, money, spent, mechanizing, agriculture, rose, in, 1978, the, international, monetary, fund, imf, negotiated, a, structural, adjustment, program, with, the, government, this, further, promoted, the,

and, supplied, by, the, british, but, relations, were, cut, off, after, the, arab, israel, six, day, war, in, 1967, at, this, time, relations, with, the, us, and, west, germany, were, also, cut, off, from, 1968, to, 1971, the, soviet, union, and, eastern, bloc, nations, sold, large, numbers, of, weapons, and, provided, technical, assistance, and, training, to, sudan, at, this, time, the, army, grew, in, manpower, from, 18, 000, to, roughly, 60, 000, men, large, numbers, of, tanks, aircraft, and, artillery, were, acquired, at, this, time, and, they, dominated, the, army, until, the, late,

million, people, were, threatened, by, famine, particularly, in, western, sudan, the, situation, was, worsened, by, the, new, government, of, sudan, attempting, to, hide, the, situation,

and, whether, they, merely, seek, an, improved, position, for, darfur, within, sudan, or, outright, secession, both, the, government, and, the, rebels, have, been, accused, of, atrocities, in, this,

rwandan, troops, in, to, protect, the, ceasefire, monitors, it, however, soon, became, apparent, that, 150, troops, would, not, be, enough, so, they, were, joined, by, 150, nigerian, troops, on, 18,
