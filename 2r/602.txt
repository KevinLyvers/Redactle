practices, the, success, of, these, jihads, was, due, not, only, to, military, prowess, but, he, appealed, to, the, fulani, through, the, desire, for, conquest, and, enslavement, of, the, polytheists, the, fulani, were, instrumental, in, the, expansion, of, the, caliphate, the, final, stage, 1815, 1840, involved, further, consolidation, and, minor, campaigns, against, resistant, elements, by, this, time, the, caliphate, had, grown, into, one, of, the, largest, empires, in, africa, extending, over, present, day, northern, nigeria, parts, of, niger, cameroon, and, benin, this, expansion, led, to, profound, changes, on, local, populations, the, spread, of, islam, was, a, significant, outcome, transforming, the, religious, landscape, of, the, region, islamic, law, was, imposed, affecting, local, customs, and, norms, especially, concerning, property, rights, marriage, and, criminal, justice, this, religious, influence, continues, to, shape, the, socio, cultural, dynamics, of, the, region,

the, sokoto, caliphate, launched, a, series, of, attacks, against, the, oyo, empire, these, attacks, combined, with, internal, conflicts, led, to, the, final, collapse, of, the, oyo, empire, by, the, mid, 19th, century, parts, of, present, day, niger, particularly, the, regions, bordering, nigeria, were, conquered, by, the, sokoto, caliphate, the, town, of, birnin, konni, for, instance, was, a,

been, run, largely, through, hereditary, succession, the, early, rulers, of, sokoto, dan, fodio, and, bello, abolished, systems, of, hereditary, succession, preferring, leaders, to, be, appointed, by, virtue, of, their, islamic, scholarship, and, moral, standing, emirs, were, appointed, by, the, sultan, they, traveled, yearly, to, pledge, allegiance, and, deliver, taxes, in, the, form, of, crops, cowry, shells, and, slaves, when, a, sultan, died, or, retired, from, the, office, an, appointment, council, made, up, of, the, emirs, would, select, a, replacement, direct, lines, of, succession, were, largely, not, followed, although, each, sultan, claimed, direct, descent, from, dan, fodio, the, caliphate, absorbed, many, of, the, structures, of, governments, of, their, hausa, predecessors, which, they, had, conquered, it, ruled, under, islamic, law, with, powers, falling, to, the, emirates, which, made, up, the, caliphate, a, large, number, of, emirs, and, senior, officials, were, fulani, clerics, and, scholars, who, participated, in, the, fulani, war, the, major, administrative, division, was, between, sokoto, and, the, gwandu, emirate, in, 1815, usman, dan, fodio, retired, from, the, administrative, business, of, the, state, and, divided, the, area, taken, over, during, the, fulani, war, with, his, brother, abdullahi, dan, fodio, ruling, in, the, west, with, the, gwandu, emirate, and, his, son, muhammed, bello, taking, over, administration, of, the, sokoto, sultanate, the, emir, at, gwandu, retained, allegiance, to, the, sokoto, sultanate, and, spiritual, guidance, from, the, sultan, but, the, emir, managed, the, separate, emirates, under, his, supervision, independently, from, the, sultan, the, administrative, structure, of, loose, allegiances, of, the, emirates, to, the, sultan, did, not, always, function, smoothly, there, was, a, series, of, revolutions, by, the, hausa, aristocracy, in, 1816, 1817, during, the, reign, of, muhammed, bello, but, the, sultan, ended, these, by, granting, the, leaders, titles, to, land, there, were, multiple, crises, that, arose, during, the, 19th, century, between, the, sokoto, sultanate, and, many, of, the, subservient, emirates, notably, the, adamawa, emirate, and, the, kano, emirate, a, serious, revolt, occurred, in, 1836, in, the, city, state, of, gobir, which, was, crushed, by, muhammed, bello, at, the, battle, of, gawakuke, the, sufi, community, throughout, the, region, proved, crucial, in, the, administration, of, the, state, the, tariqa, brotherhoods, most, notably, the, qadiriyya, to, which, every, successive, sultan, of, sokoto, was, an, adherent, provided, a, group, linking, the, distinct, emirates, to, the, authority, of, the, sultan, scholars, burnham, and, last, claim, that, this, islamic, scholarship, community, provided, an, embryonic, bureaucracy, which, linked, the, cities, throughout, the, sokoto, state, the, caliphate, and, its, resulting, emirates, each, had, viziers, waziris, as, they, are, called, in, the, caliphate, those, viziers, mostly, came, from, the, most, learned, families, in, sokoto, learned, not, only, in, the, legal, and, political, aspects, of, islam, but, also, in, its, mystical, side, the, classical, vizierate, is, based, on, some, verses, from, the, quran, so, people, may, understand, my, speech, and, grant, me, a, helper, from, my, family, aaron, my, brother, strengthen, me, through, him, and, let, him, share, my, task, the, vizierate, in, sokoto, was, based, on, the, abbasid, caliphate, version, of, the, position, shaikh, uthman, dan, fodio, s, book, bayan, wujab, al, hijra, justifies, the, existence, of, the, position, in, the, caliphate, the, first, pillar, is, an, upright, wazir, vizier, over, the, wilaya, who, wakens, if, he, sleeps, and, gives, him, sight, if, he, cannot, see, and, reminds, him, if, he, is, heedless, the, greatest, catastrophe, which, could, befall, the, wilaya, and, its, subjects, is, to, be, deprived, of, good, wazirs, and, helpers, one, of, the, requirements, of, a, wazir, is, that, he, should, truly, be, benevolent, and, kind, hearted, towards, the, people, the, first, grand, vizier, of, sokoto, was, abdullahi, dan, fodio, he, was, described, as, a, helper, to, the, shaikh, the, most, important, of, his, helpers, the, 2nd, grand, vizier, was, waziri, gidado, bin, abu, bakr, who, was, under, sultan, muhammad, bello, all, subsequent, grand, vizier, of, sokoto, came, from, his, family, with, his, great, grandson, gidado, idris, continuing, the, tradition, of, being, the, helper, to, a, head, of, state, by, serving, as, secretary, to, the, government, of, the, federation, under, the, government, of, general, sani, abacha, waziri, gidado, was, married, to, the, shaikh, s, daughter, nana, asma, u, dan, fodio, abdullahi, dan, fodio, the, previous, grand, vizier, refused, to, relinquish, the, position, even, though, sultan, bello, chose, gidado, but, he, later, formally, recognised, gidado, as, the, new, vizier, after, his, reconciliation, with, muhammad, bello, giving, gidado, his, robes, in, token, as, vizier, gidado, had, considerable, freedom, of, judgement, he, retired, the, emir, of, daura, ishaq, and, appointed, his, son, zubair, bin, ishaq, which, was, later, approved, by, sultan, bello, the, position, had, a, considerable, following, the, scottish, explorer, hugh, clapperton, in, 1826, speaks, of, a, numerous, train, of, attendants, on, horseback, and, on, foot, another, explorer, paul, staudinger, in, 1886, says, the, vizier, had, considerable, house, power, eine, ziemliche, hausmacht, having, a, hundred, gunmen, in, his, following, he, had, several, estates, and, villages, under, him, but, their, inhabitants, are, often, scattered, and, distant, from, sokoto, only, joining, him, for, a, major, expedition, foreign, visitors, between, 1880, and, 1890, often, saw, the, position, as, all, powerful, the, scottish, geologist, and, explorer, joseph, thomson, described, him, as, being, more, powerful, than, the, sultan, himself, since, nothing, is, done, except, by, his, advice, staudinger, reported, that, he, was, the, most, powerful, of, ministers, almost, more, so, than, the, sultan, since, all, government, business, went, through, him, william, wallace, found, that, the, grand, vizier, practically, rules, the, fulah, empire, and, holds, all, the, real, power, the, sultans, being, completely, hedged, in, by, formalities, though, these, impressions, are, exaggerated, the, vizier, did, appear, to, have, the, whole, civil, service, under, his, control, the, vizierate, never, rivalled, the, caliph, s, position, the, vizier, was, the, chief, supporter, adviser, and, friend, to, the, caliph, and, in, that, position, was, able, to, reassert, the, islamic, tradition, in, sokoto, the, military, which, was, commanded, by, the, sarkin, yaki, war, commander, the, title, still, held, by, the, descendants, of, ali, jedo, at, the, time, of, the, jihad, was, organized, into, a, standing, army, and, a, cavalry, the, standing, army, was, composed, of, hausa, and, fulani, warriors, who, were, trained, in, warfare, and, were, responsible, for, the, caliphate, s, defense, and, the, expansion, of, its, territories, the, cavalry, was, an, essential, part, of, the, military, as, horses, were, the, primary, mode, of, transportation, during, this, period, during, the, expansion, the, caliphate, s, military, utilized, a, strategy, of, establishing, emirates, in, conquered, territories, these, emirates, were, governed, by, emirs, who, were, either, appointed, by, the, sultan, or, were, local, rulers, who, had, submitted, to, the, caliphate, s, authority, this, strategy, helped, in, maintaining, control, over, the, vast, territories, of, the, caliphate, the, sokoto, caliphate, relied, heavily, on, the, use, of, cavalry, in, its, military, campaigns, the, fulani, horsemen, renowned, for, their, equestrian, skills, formed, the, core, of, the, caliphate, s, cavalry, they, were, instrumental, in, the, rapid, expansion, of, the, caliphate, s, territories, parfait, louis, monteil, the, french, explorer, who, visited, the, caliphate, in, 1890, claimed, that, he, witnessed, sultan, umaru, bin, ali, raise, an, army, of, forty, thousand, men, half, of, whom, were, cavalry, to, lay, siege, to, argungu, additionally, the, caliphate, s, military, strategy, involved, a, system, of, alliances, with, local, rulers, in, some, cases, these, rulers, were, allowed, to, maintain, their, positions, under, the, condition, that, they, pledged, allegiance, to, the, caliphate, and, adopted, islam, this, strategy, helped, to, solidify, the, caliphate, s, control, over, conquered, territories, the, military, expansion, of, the, sokoto, caliphate, had, significant, social, political, and, economic, impacts, it, led, to, the, spread, of, islam, and, the, fulani, language, and, culture, in, the, region, the, caliphate, s, rule, also, resulted, in, changes, in, local, governance, systems, and, the, economy, with, the, introduction, of, new, administrative, structures, and, trade, networks, islamic, scholarship, was, a, crucial, aspect, of, the, caliphate, from, its, founding, sultan, usman, dan, fodio, sultan, muhammed, bello, emir, abdullahi, dan, fodio, sultan, abu, bakr, atiku, and, nana, asma, u, devoted, significant, time, to, chronicling, histories, writing, poetry, and, islamic, studies, a, number, of, manuscripts, are, available, and, they, provide, crucial, historical, information, and, important, spiritual, texts, this, role, did, diminish, after, the, reign, of, bello, and, atiku, although, veiling, was, practiced, it, did, not, stop, women, from, being, educated, in, the, caliphate, many, of, the, women, around, shaikh, uthman, dan, fodio, like, his, wives, and, daughters, were, also, his, students, and, attained, great, learning, slaves, were, encouraged, to, become, muslims, and, their, children, were, given, muslim, education, and, were, taught, arabic, after, the, establishment, of, the, caliphate, there, were, decades, of, economic, growth, throughout, the, region, particularly, after, a, wave, of, revolts, in, 1816, 1817, they, had, significant, trade, over, the, trans, saharan, routes, after, the, fulani, war, all, land, in, the, empire, was, declared, waqf, or, owned, by, the, entire, community, however, the, sultan, allocated, land, to, individuals, or, families, as, could, an, emir, such, land, could, be, inherited, by, family, members, but, could, not, be, sold, exchange, was, based, largely, on, slaves, cowries, or, gold, major, crops, produced, included, cotton, indigo, kola, and, shea, nuts, grain, rice, tobacco, and, onion, considerable, numbers, of, scholars, and, the, poor, depended, on, the, great, houses, for, basic, amenities, like, food, and, clothing, food, was, prepared, in, the, houses, which, then, acted, like, communal, canteens, clothing, came, largely, from, the, payments, from, the, other, emirates, in, the, caliphate, and, was, redistributed, to, the, community, this, system, helped, sokoto, maintain, a, large, scholar, community, its, commercial, prosperity, was, also, based, on, islamic, traditions, market, integration, internal, peace, and, an, extensive, export, trade, network, slavery, remained, a, large, part, of, the, economy, although, its, operation, had, changed, with, the, end, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, slaves, were, gained, through, raiding, and, via, markets, as, had, operated, earlier, in, west, africa, the, founder, of, the, caliphate, allowed, slavery, only, for, non, muslims, slavery, was, viewed, as, a, process, to, bring, such, peoples, into, the, muslim, community, at, least, half, of, the, caliphate, s, population, was, enslaved, in, the, 19th, century, there, was, a, huge, expansion, of, slaves, due, to, the, jihad, campaigns, frontier, wars, and, slave, raids, the, expansion, of, agricultural, plantations, under, the, caliphate, was, dependent, on, slave, labor, these, plantations, were, established, around, the, ribats, and, large, areas, of, agricultural, production, took, place, around, the, cities, of, the, empire, the, institution, of, slavery, was, mediated, by, the, lack, of, a, racial, barrier, among, the, peoples, and, by, a, complex, and, varying, set, of, relations, between, owners, and, slaves, which, included, the, right, to, accumulate, property, by, working, on, their, own, plots, manumission, and, the, potential, for, slaves, to, convert, and, become, members, of, the, islamic, community, there, are, historical, records, of, slaves, reaching, high, levels, of, government, and, administration, in, the, sokoto, caliphate, on, the, other, hand, these, liniments, to, the, slaving, system, were, like, those, in, other, slave, societies, a, buttress, rather, than, a, detriment, although, in, some, cases, undoubtedly, beneficial, to, individual, slaves, as, mohammed, bashir, salau, writes, unfortunately, for, most, slaves, however, masters, often, selected, those, they, granted, freedom, in, part, because, to, maintain, the, plantation, order, and, in, part, to, prevent, the, formation, of, a, group, consciousness, among, slaves, similarly, although, the, islamic, religion, encouraged, voluntary, emancipation, and, slave, owners, were, convinced, that, god, would, reward, them, when, they, freed, slaves, most, masters, were, very, selective, about, whom, they, freed, they, often, gave, first, preference, to, slaves, who, exhibited, good, behavior, and, were, honest, and, hardworking, also, to, those, who, were, too, sick, and, too, old, to, engage, in, rigorous, plantation, activities, this, not, only, perpetuated, the, plantation, s, social, order, but, also, reduced, the, slave, owner, s, expenditures, by, freeing, elderly, and, infirm, slaves, the, owner, did, not, have, to, pay, for, their, care, indeed, the, incorrigible, slave, would, have, the, worst, treatment, visited, upon, them, by, the, state, slave, prison, system, in, 1829, bain, hugh, clapperton, wrote, in, this, space, is, also, the, prison, a, building, of, about, eighty, feet, long, and, nearly, the, same, in, breadth, covered, at, top, with, a, flat, clay, roof, overlaid, with, boughs, inside, is, a, deep, pit, where, those, who, have, committed, the, greatest, crimes, are, confined, no, person, is, put, in, prison, for, debt, only, thieves, prisoners, of, war, taken, singly, such, as, spies, and, disobedient, slaves, who, on, a, complaint, to, the, sultan, that, they, will, not, work, are, sent, to, prison, their, only, food, is, the, bran, or, husks, of, millet, and, dourra, with, water, but, their, friends, are, allowed, to, give, them, food, if, they, have, any, it, is, a, filthy, place, and, the, terror, of, the, men, slaves, of, soccatoo, the, prisoners, are, taken, out, two, and, two, every, day, to, work, at, the, walls, or, any, laborious, work, which, may, occur, in, the, kano, area, for, instance, gidan, ma, ajin, watari, was, the, primary, slave, prison, if, not, desiring, sale, the, slave, owner, would, lay, out, the, particular, charge, and, thereafter, the, erring, slave, was, admitted, into, the, facility, through, a, succession, of, two, doors, being, severely, beaten, in, the, process, frederick, john, dealtry, lugard, 1st, baron, lugard, in, a, 1903, colonial, account, wrote, thusly, about, conditions, i, visited, the, dungeon, myself, a, small, doorway, 2, feet, 6, inches, by, 1, foot, 6, inches, gives, access, into, it, the, interior, is, divided, by, a, thick, mud, wall, with, a, similar, hole, through, it, into, two, compartments, each, 17, feet, by, 7, feet, and, 11, feet, high, this, wall, was, pierced, with, holes, at, its, base, through, which, the, legs, of, those, sentenced, to, death, were, thrust, up, to, the, thigh, and, they, were, left, to, be, trodden, on, by, the, mass, of, other, prisoners, till, they, died, of, thirst, and, starvation, the, place, is, entirely, air, tight, and, unventilated, except, for, the, one, small, doorway, or, rather, hole, in, the, wall, through, which, you, creep, the, total, space, inside, is, 2, 618, cubic, feet, and, at, the, time, we, took, kano, 135, human, beings, were, confined, here, each, night, being, let, out, during, the, day, to, cook, their, food, c, in, a, small, adjoining, area, recently, as, many, as, 200, have, been, interned, at, one, time, as, the, superficial, ground, area, was, only, 238, square, feet, there, was, not, of, course, even, standing, room, victims, were, crushed, to, death, every, night, and, their, corpses, were, hauled, out, each, morning, the, stench, i, am, told, inside, the, place, when, colonel, morland, visited, it, was, intolerable, though, it, was, empty, and, when, i, myself, went, inside, three, weeks, later, the, effluvium, was, unbearable, for, more, than, a, few, seconds, a, putrid, corpse, even, then, lay, near, the, doorway, salau, adds, that, while, in, prison, a, slave, was, usually, subjected, to, torture, by, fellow, inmates, as, well, as, by, guards, ultimately, it, was, the, master, who, decided, how, many, days, the, slave, would, spend, in, the, facility, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, protectorate, of, northern, nigeria, inherited, one, of, the, biggest, slave, populations, in, the, world, one, to, two, and, a, half, million, slaves, a, flourishing, slave, trade, supplied, by, slave, raids, and, thousands, of, slaves, given, as, tributes, to, the, sultan, of, sokoto, and, his, emirs, the, british, high, commissioner, lugard, abolished, the, legal, status, of, slavery, without, compensation, and, officially, declared, all, children, born, to, slaves, after, 31, march, 1901, as, born, free, however, the, slaves, were, given, no, assistance, and, cases, of, fugitive, slaves, were, often, handed, over, to, indigenous, islamic, sharia, courts, which, often, restored, them, back, to, their, muslim, owners, by, the, 1920s, big, slave, trade, caravans, had, been, eradicated, by, the, colonial, officials, but, small, scale, slave, trading, was, difficult, to, fully, abolish, one, example, was, the, trade, in, adamawa, girls, who, were, bought, by, merchants, and, kept, for, a, year, in, cameroon, learning, hausa, until, they, could, be, smuggled, in, to, nigeria, to, be, sold, in, kano, for, concubinage, or, domestic, service, slave, brokers, who, themselves, were, formerly, concubines, were, procuring, young, girls, for, purposes, of, sale, into, slavery, despite, legal, prohibitions, which, dated, from, the, colonial, era, to, the, contrary, slave, concubinage, was, a, functioning, institution, in, the, northern, states, of, nigeria, in, 1988, the, fulani, ruling, class, engaged, in, marriage, alliances, with, hausa, families, the, hausa, language, became, the, language, of, administration, and, main, medium, of, poetry, in, the, caliphate, although, it, has, lost, its, former, political, power, the, sokoto, sultanate, council, continues, to, exist, and, the, sokoto, sultans, are, still, leading, figures, in, nigerian, society, even, the, presidents, of, nigeria, have, sought, their, support, due, to, its, impact, the, sokoto, caliphate, is, also, revered, by, islamists, in, modern, nigeria, for, example, the, jihadist, militant, group, ansaru, has, vowed, to, revive, the, sokoto, caliphate, in, order, to, restore, the, lost, dignity, of, muslims, in, black, africa, the, influence, of, the, sokoto, caliphate, can, also, be, seen, in, extremist, groups, like, boko, haram, boko, haram, based, in, northeastern, nigeria, promotes, an, extremist, interpretation, of, islam, and, seeks, to, establish, an, islamic, state, governed, by, strict, sharia, law, while, they, have, occasionally, referenced, usman, dan, fodio, s, legacy, to, justify, their, actions, presenting, their, struggle, as, a, continuation, of, the, original, jihad, there, are, fundamental, differences, between, the, two, jihadist, movements, the, sokoto, jihad, s, intellectual, thought, according, to, historian, michael, cook, can, be, described, as, part, of, the, sixteenth, to, eighteenth, centuries, islamic, world, s, conservative, orientation, towards, intellectual, innovation, the, three, leaders, of, the, jihad, namely, usman, abdullahi, and, bello, drew, heavily, from, maliki, and, qadriyya, texts, with, connections, to, wider, islamic, intellectual, networks, in, contrast, boko, haram, operates, in, a, globalized, world, and, draws, influences, from, salafi, and, wahhabi, ideology, and, is, connected, and, influenced, by, global, salafi, jihadist, networks, boko, haram, operates, primarily, in, borno, state, and, it, is, indeed, important, to, acknowledge, the, historical, context, of, the, state, which, is, the, central, fragment, of, the, old, kanem, bornu, empire, of, the, kanuri, people, bornu, led, by, shaikh, al, kanemi, had, a, history, of, resistance, against, the, sokoto, jihad, and, actively, opposed, the, encroachment, and, ideology, of, the, caliphate, there, were, intense, debates, and, correspondence, between, bello, and, al, kanemi, during, the, jihad, reflecting, their, differing, perspectives, while, the, sokoto, caliphate, had, limited, success, in, fully, subjugating, bornu, it, is, worth, noting, that, boko, haram, founded, by, muhammad, yusuf, and, later, led, by, shekau, also, emerged, from, the, kanuri, community, their, ideology, criticized, the, established, islamic, tradition, of, the, sokoto, caliphate, considering, it, impure, and, in, need, of, reform, they, sought, to, return, to, what, they, perceived, as, more, orthodox, practices, based, on, salafi, thought, rejecting, the, maliki, law, and, sufi, influences, of, the, sokoto, caliphate, influential, salafi, scholars, in, nigeria, critique, boko, haram, highlighting, their, leaders, lack, of, proper, education, in, fiqh, islamic, jurisprudence, and, their, misinterpretation, and, misuse, of, salafi, texts, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, sokoto, jihad, leaders, who, were, renowned, maliki, scholars, with, usman, and, abdullahi, already, being, respected, scholars, prior, to, the, jihad, 13, 04, 02, n, 05, 14, 52, e, 13, 06722, n, 5, 24778, e, 13, 06722, 5, 24778
