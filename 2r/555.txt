initiated, by, napoleon, with, the, aim, of, compelling, the, russian, empire, to, comply, with, the, continental, blockade, of, the, united, kingdom, widely, studied, napoleon, s, incursion, into, russia, stands, as, a, focal, point, in, military, history, recognized, as, among, the, most, devastating, military, endeavors, globally, in, a, span, of, fewer, than, six, months, the, campaign, exacted, a, staggering, toll, claiming, the, lives, of, nearly, a, million, soldiers, and, civilians, on, 24, june, 1812, and, subsequent, days, the, initial, wave, of, the, multinational, grande, arm, e, crossed, the, niemen, river, marking, the, entry, from, the, duchy, of, warsaw, into, russia, employing, extensive, forced, marches, napoleon, rapidly, advanced, his, army, of, nearly, half, a, million, individuals, through, western, russia, encompassing, present, day, belarus, in, a, bid, to, dismantle, the, disparate, russian, forces, led, by, barclay, de, tolly, and, pyotr, bagration, totaling, approximately, 180, 000, 220, 000, soldiers, at, that, juncture, despite, losing, half, of, his, men, within, six, weeks, due, to, extreme, weather, conditions, diseases, and, scarcity, of, provisions, napoleon, emerged, victorious, in, the, battle, of, smolensk, however, the, russian, army, now, commanded, by, mikhail, kutuzov, opted, for, a, strategic, retreat, employing, attrition, warfare, against, napoleon, compelling, the, invaders, to, rely, on, an, inadequate, supply, system, incapable, of, sustaining, their, vast, army, in, the, field, the, fierce, battle, of, borodino, located, 110, kilometres, 70, mi, west, of, moscow, concluded, as, a, narrow, victory, for, the, french, although, napoleon, was, not, able, to, beat, the, russian, army, and, kutuzov, could, not, stop, the, french, at, the, council, at, fili, kutuzov, made, the, critical, decision, not, to, defend, the, city, but, to, orchestrate, a, general, withdrawal, prioritizing, the, preservation, of, the, russian, army, on, 14, september, napoleon, and, his, roughly, 100, 000, strong, army, took, control, of, moscow, only, to, discover, it, deserted, and, set, ablaze, by, its, military, governor, fyodor, rostopchin, remaining, in, moscow, for, five, weeks, napoleon, awaited, a, peace, proposal, that, never, materialized, due, to, favorable, weather, conditions, napoleon, delayed, his, retreat, and, hoping, to, secure, supplies, began, a, different, route, westward, than, the, one, the, army, had, devastated, on, the, way, there, however, after, losing, the, battle, of, maloyaroslavets, he, was, compelled, to, retrace, his, initial, path, as, early, november, arrived, snowfall, and, frost, complicated, the, retreat, shortages, of, food, and, winter, attire, for, the, soldiers, and, provision, for, the, horses, combined, with, guerilla, warfare, from, russian, peasants, and, cossacks, resulted, in, significant, losses, more, than, half, of, the, soldiers, perished, from, exhaustion, typhus, and, the, unforgiving, continental, climate, during, the, battle, of, krasnoi, napoleon, faced, a, critical, scarcity, of, cavalry, and, artillery, due, to, severe, snowfall, and, icy, conditions, employing, a, strategic, maneuver, he, deployed, the, old, guard, against, miloradovich, who, obstructed, the, primary, road, to, krasny, effectively, isolating, him, from, the, main, army, davout, successfully, broke, through, eugene, de, beauharnais, and, michel, ney, were, forced, to, take, a, detour, despite, the, consolidation, of, several, retreating, french, corps, with, the, main, army, by, the, time, they, reached, the, berezina, napoleon, commanded, only, around, 49, 000, troops, alongside, 40, 000, stragglers, of, little, military, significance, on, 5, december, napoleon, departed, from, the, army, at, smorgonie, in, a, sled, and, returned, to, paris, within, a, few, days, an, additional, 20, 000, people, succombed, to, the, bitter, cold, and, diseases, carried, by, lice, murat, and, ney, assumed, command, pressing, forward, but, leaving, over, 20, 000, men, in, the, hospitals, of, vilnius, the, remnants, of, the, principal, armies, disheartened, crossed, the, frozen, niemen, and, the, bug, while, exact, figures, remain, elusive, due, to, the, absence, of, meticulous, records, estimations, varied, and, often, included, exaggerated, counts, overlooking, auxiliary, troops, napoleon, s, initial, force, upon, entering, russia, exceeded, 450, 000, men, accompanied, by, over, 150, 000, horses, approximately, 25, 000, wagons, and, nearly, 1, 400, artillery, pieces, however, the, surviving, count, dwindled, to, a, mere, 120, 000, men, excluding, early, deserters, signifying, a, staggering, loss, of, approximately, 380, 000, lives, throughout, the, campaign, half, of, which, resulted, from, diseases, this, catastrophic, outcome, shattered, napoleon, s, once, untarnished, reputation, of, invincibility, the, french, invasion, is, known, as, the, russian, campaign, the, second, polish, war, the, second, polish, campaign, the, patriotic, war, of, 1812, or, the, war, of, 1812, it, should, not, be, confused, with, the, great, patriotic, war, velikaya, otechestvennaya, voyna, a, term, for, the, german, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, during, the, second, world, war, the, patriotic, war, of, 1812, is, also, occasionally, referred, to, as, simply, the, war, of, 1812, a, term, which, should, not, be, confused, with, the, conflict, between, great, britain, and, the, united, states, also, known, as, the, war, of, 1812, in, russian, literature, written, before, the, russian, revolution, the, war, was, occasionally, described, as, the, invasion, of, twelve, languages, russian, napoleon, termed, this, war, the, second, polish, war, in, an, attempt, to, gain, increased, support, from, polish, nationalists, and, patriots, though, the, stated, goal, of, the, war, was, the, resurrection, of, the, polish, state, on, the, territories, of, the, former, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, modern, territories, of, poland, lithuania, latvia, estonia, belarus, and, ukraine, in, fact, this, issue, was, of, no, real, concern, to, napoleon, from, 1792, onwards, france, found, itself, frequently, embroiled, in, conflicts, with, major, european, powers, a, direct, aftermath, of, the, french, revolution, napoleon, rising, to, power, in, 1799, and, assuming, autocratic, rule, over, france, orchestrated, numerous, military, campaigns, that, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, first, french, empire, starting, in, 1803, the, napoleonic, wars, served, as, a, testament, to, napoleon, s, military, prowess, he, secured, victories, in, the, war, of, the, third, coalition, 1803, 1806, leading, to, the, dissolution, of, the, thousand, year, old, holy, roman, empire, the, war, of, the, fourth, coalition, 1806, 1807, and, the, war, of, the, fifth, coalition, 1809, in, 1807, following, a, french, triumph, at, friedland, napoleon, and, alexander, i, of, russia, signed, the, treaty, of, tilsit, along, the, neman, river, these, treaties, progressively, solidified, russia, s, alignment, with, france, allowing, napoleon, to, exert, dominance, over, neighboring, states, the, accord, rendered, russia, an, ally, of, france, leading, to, their, adoption, of, the, continental, system, a, blockade, aimed, at, the, united, kingdom, however, the, treaty, imposed, significant, economic, strain, on, russia, prompting, tsar, alexander, to, break, away, from, the, continental, blockade, on, december, 31, 1810, this, decision, left, napoleon, without, his, primary, foreign, policy, tool, against, the, united, kingdom, the, treaty, of, sch, nbrunn, concluding, the, 1809, conflict, between, austria, and, france, included, a, clause, that, transferred, western, galicia, from, austria, and, annexing, it, to, the, grand, duchy, of, warsaw, this, move, was, seen, unfavorably, by, russia, perceiving, the, territory, s, annexation, as, a, potential, threat, for, a, french, invasion, point, russia, s, foreign, minister, nikolay, rumyantsev, advocated, for, a, closer, alliance, with, france, in, response, in, an, attempt, to, secure, greater, cooperation, from, russia, napoleon, initially, pursued, an, alliance, by, proposing, marriage, to, anna, pavlovna, the, youngest, sister, of, alexander, however, he, ultimately, married, marie, louise, the, daughter, of, the, austrian, emperor, subsequently, france, and, austria, solidified, their, relationship, by, signing, an, alliance, treaty, on, 14, march, 1812, in, march, 1811, marshal, davout, received, orders, to, clandestinely, prepare, for, a, demonstration, of, military, strength, aimed, at, impressing, russia, this, plan, involved, deploying, dutch, troops, to, magdeburg, and, occupying, the, baltic, ports, stettin, and, danzig, during, this, period, napoleon, s, physical, and, mental, condition, underwent, changes, he, experienced, weight, gain, and, increasing, susceptibility, to, various, health, issues, in, may, 1812, he, left, his, palace, in, saint, cloud, one, month, later, he, arrived, in, toru, committed, to, catherine, the, great, s, expansion, policy, alexander, i, issued, an, ultimatum, in, april, 1812, demanding, the, evacuation, of, french, troops, from, prussia, and, the, grand, duchy, of, warsaw, when, napoleon, chose, war, over, retreat, between, june, 8, and, 20, the, troops, remained, in, constant, motion, enduring, arduous, marches, amid, intense, heat, napoleon, s, primary, objective, was, to, defeat, the, imperial, russian, army, and, compel, czar, alexander, i, to, rejoin, to, the, continental, system, from, 21, 22, june, 1812, bonaparte, stayed, at, vilkavi, kis, manor, in, polish, wilkowiszky, there, napoleon, announced, the, following, proclamation, soldiers, the, second, polish, war, is, begun, the, first, terminated, at, friedland, and, at, tilsit, russia, vowed, an, eternal, alliance, with, france, and, war, with, the, english, she, now, breaks, her, vows, and, refuses, to, give, any, explanation, of, her, strange, conduct, until, the, french, eagles, have, repassed, the, rhine, and, left, our, allies, at, her, mercy, russia, is, hurried, away, by, a, fatality, her, destinies, will, be, fulfilled, does, she, think, us, degenerated, are, we, no, more, the, soldiers, who, fought, at, austerlitz, she, places, us, between, dishonour, and, war, our, choice, cannot, be, difficult, let, us, then, march, forward, let, us, cross, the, niemen, and, carry, the, war, into, her, country, this, second, polish, war, will, be, as, glorious, for, the, french, arms, as, the, first, has, been, but, the, peace, we, shall, conclude, shall, carry, with, it, its, own, guarantee, and, will, terminate, the, fatal, influence, which, russia, for, fifty, years, past, has, exercised, in, europe, the, invasion, of, russia, starkly, highlights, the, pivotal, role, of, logistics, in, military, strategy, particularly, in, situations, where, the, available, terrain, cannot, sustain, the, large, number, of, deployed, troops, napoleon, meticulously, prepared, for, supplying, his, army, significantly, surpassing, the, logistical, efforts, of, previous, campaigns, to, sustain, the, grande, arm, e, and, its, operations, twenty, train, battalions, with, 7, 848, vehicles, were, mobilized, to, provide, a, 40, day, supply, extensive, magazines, were, strategically, set, up, in, towns, and, cities, across, poland, and, east, prussia, while, the, vistula, river, valley, was, developed, into, a, vital, supply, base, in, 1811, 1812, intendant, quartermaster, general, dumas, organized, five, supply, lines, from, the, rhine, to, the, vistula, establishing, administrative, headquarters, in, three, arrondissements, in, french, controlled, germany, and, poland, this, logistical, preparation, served, as, a, significant, trial, of, napoleon, s, administrative, and, logistical, acumen, with, his, focus, in, the, first, half, of, 1812, dedicated, mainly, to, provisioning, his, invading, army, napoleon, s, study, of, russian, geography, and, history, including, charles, xii, s, invasion, of, 1708, 1709, reinforced, his, understanding, of, the, imperative, to, transport, as, many, supplies, as, possible, the, french, army, s, prior, experience, operating, in, the, sparsely, populated, and, underdeveloped, regions, of, poland, and, east, prussia, during, the, war, of, the, fourth, coalition, 1806, 1807, also, informed, their, approach, however, nothing, was, to, go, as, planned, because, napoleon, had, failed, to, take, into, account, conditions, that, were, totally, different, from, what, he, had, known, so, far, napoleon, and, the, grande, arm, e, were, accustomed, to, utilizing, the, method, of, living, off, the, land, which, proved, successful, in, the, densely, populated, and, agriculturally, prosperous, regions, of, central, europe, characterized, by, a, well, connected, network, of, roads, swift, forced, marches, had, disoriented, the, traditional, austrian, and, prussian, armies, relying, extensively, on, foraging, for, sustenance, colonel, pion, documented, the, logistical, challenges, that, this, strategy, imposed, on, the, army, there, is, no, fodder, for, the, horses, as, usual, there, is, no, order, or, administration, the, army, must, live, by, the, sword, and, even, on, prussian, territory, and, with, their, allies, the, troops, pillage, atrociously, as, if, they, were, in, an, enemy, s, country, during, the, campaign, the, widespread, death, and, depletion, of, horses, emerged, as, a, significant, issue, forced, marches, often, forced, troops, to, go, without, essential, supplies, as, supply, wagons, struggled, to, keep, pace, the, scarcity, of, roads, frequently, turned, to, mud, by, rainstorms, rasputitsa, further, impeded, horse, drawn, wagons, and, artillery, in, thinly, populated, and, agriculturally, sparse, regions, the, lack, of, food, and, water, led, to, casualties, among, troops, and, their, mounts, exposing, them, to, waterborne, diseases, from, drinking, contaminated, water, and, consuming, spoiled, food, and, forage, while, the, foremost, sections, of, the, army, received, whatever, provisions, could, be, supplied, formations, behind, them, suffered, from, starvation, during, the, attack, phase, vilna, stood, as, the, most, advanced, magazine, in, the, operational, area, beyond, that, point, the, army, had, to, rely, solely, on, its, own, resources, danzig, contained, enough, provisions, to, feed, 400, 000, men, for, 50, days, breslau, plock, and, wyszogr, d, were, turned, into, grain, depots, milling, vast, quantities, of, flour, for, delivery, to, thorn, where, 60, 000, biscuits, were, produced, every, day, a, large, bakery, was, established, at, villenberg, braniewo, county, 50, 000, cattle, were, collected, to, follow, the, army, after, the, invasion, began, large, magazines, were, constructed, at, kovno, kaunas, vilna, vilnius, and, minsk, with, the, vilna, base, having, enough, rations, to, feed, 100, 000, men, for, 40, days, it, also, contained, 27, 000, muskets, 30, 000, pairs, of, shoes, along, with, brandy, and, wine, medium, sized, depots, were, established, at, vitebsk, orsha, and, smolensk, and, several, small, ones, throughout, the, russian, interior, the, french, also, captured, numerous, intact, russian, supply, dumps, which, the, russians, had, failed, to, destroy, or, empty, and, moscow, itself, was, filled, with, food, twenty, train, battalions, provided, most, of, the, transportation, with, a, combined, load, of, 8, 390, tons, twelve, of, these, battalions, had, a, total, of, 3, 024, heavy, wagons, drawn, by, four, horses, each, four, had, 2, 424, one, horse, light, wagons, and, four, had, 2, 400, wagons, drawn, by, oxen, auxiliary, supply, convoys, were, formed, on, napoleon, s, orders, in, early, june, 1812, using, vehicles, requisitioned, in, east, prussia, marshal, nicolas, oudinot, s, ii, corps, alone, took, 600, carts, formed, into, six, companies, the, wagon, trains, were, supposed, to, carry, enough, bread, flour, and, medical, supplies, for, 300, 000, men, for, two, months, the, standard, heavy, wagons, well, suited, for, the, dense, and, partially, paved, road, networks, of, germany, and, france, proved, too, cumbersome, for, the, sparse, and, primitive, russian, dirt, tracks, further, damaged, by, the, unstable, weather, many, horses, also, died, during, the, march, towards, vilnius, through, forests, which, lacked, the, necessary, fodder, slowing, even, further, the, transport, of, supplies, for, napoleon, s, troops, the, supply, route, from, smolensk, to, moscow, was, therefore, entirely, dependent, on, light, wagons, with, small, loads, central, to, the, problem, were, the, expanding, distances, to, supply, magazines, and, the, fact, that, no, supply, wagon, could, keep, up, with, a, forced, marched, infantry, column, the, weather, itself, became, an, issue, where, according, to, historian, richard, k, riehn, the, thunderstorms, of, the, 29th, turned, into, other, downpours, turning, the, tracks, some, diarists, claim, there, were, no, roads, in, lithuania, into, bottomless, mires, wagons, sank, up, to, their, hubs, horses, dropped, from, exhaustion, men, lost, their, boots, stalled, wagons, became, obstacles, that, forced, men, around, them, and, stopped, supply, wagons, and, artillery, columns, then, came, the, sun, which, would, bake, the, deep, ruts, into, canyons, of, concrete, where, horses, would, break, their, legs, and, wagons, their, wheels, jean, fran, ois, boulart, reported, then, on, june, 29th, came, a, fresh, and, awful, and, extraordinary, storm, such, a, terrible, tempest, had, not, been, known, in, the, memory, of, man, thunder, and, lightning, burst, forth, from, every, side, of, the, horizon, soldiers, were, struck, dead, torrents, of, rain, flooded, the, bivouacs, the, downpour, lasted, all, the, next, day, the, heavy, losses, to, disease, hunger, and, desertion, in, the, early, months, of, the, campaign, were, in, large, part, due, to, the, inability, to, transport, provisions, quickly, enough, to, the, troops, the, intendance, administration, failed, to, distribute, with, sufficient, rigor, the, supplies, that, were, built, up, or, captured, by, that, despite, all, these, preparations, the, grande, arm, e, was, not, self, sufficient, logistically, and, still, depended, on, foraging, to, a, significant, extent, inadequate, supplies, played, a, key, role, in, the, losses, suffered, by, the, army, as, well, davidov, and, other, russian, campaign, participants, record, wholesale, surrenders, of, starving, members, of, the, grande, arm, e, even, before, the, onset, of, the, frosts, caulaincourt, describes, men, swarming, over, and, cutting, up,

blood, and, preparing, black, pudding, was, popular, the, french, simply, were, unable, to, feed, their, army, starvation, led, to, a, general, loss, of, cohesion, constant, harassment, of, the, french, army, by, cossacks, added, to, the, losses, during, the, retreat, though, starvation, caused, horrendous, casualties, in, napoleon, s, army, losses, arose, from, other, sources, as, well, the, main, body, of, napoleon, s, grande, arm, e, diminished, by, a, third, in, just, the, first, eight, weeks, of, the, campaign, before, the, major, battle, was, fought, this, loss, in, strength, was, in, part, due, to, diseases, such, as, diphtheria, dysentery, and, typhus, and, the, need, for, garrison, supply, centres, there, are, eyewitness, reports, of, cannibalism, in, november, 1812, nine, pontoon, companies, three, pontoon, trains, with, 100, pontoons, each, two, companies, of, marines, nine, sapper, companies, six, miner, companies, and, an, engineer, park, were, deployed, for, the,

davout, had, ordered, his, i, corps, to, pillage, the, town, the, corps, coming, from, warsaw, used, the, suwa, ki, gap, several, corps, except, x, corps, passed, marijampol, before, arriving, at, the, river, neman, on, 23, june, napoleon, arrived, at, naugardi, k, south, of, kaunas, after, two, days, of, preparation, the, invasion, commenced, on, wednesday, 24, june, 1812, with, napoleon, s, army, crossing, the, border, the, army, was, split, up, into, five, columns, napoleon, initially, met, little, resistance, and, moved, quickly, into, the, enemy, s, territory, in, spite, of, the, transport, of, more, than, 1, 100, cannons, being, opposed, by, the, russian, armies, with, more, than, 900, cannons, but, the, roads, in, this, area, of, lithuania, were, actually, small, dirt, tracks, through, areas, of, birched, woodland, and, marshes, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, supply, lines, already, simply, could, not, keep, up, with, the, forced, marches, of, the, corps, and,

corps, following, behind, napoleon, spent, the, night, and, the, next, day, in, kaunas, allowing, only, his, guards, not, even, the, generals, to, enter, the, city, the, next, day, he, rushed, towards, the, capital, vilna, pushing, the, infantry, forward, in, columns, that, suffered, from, stifling, heat, heavy, rain, and, more, heat, the, central, group, marched, 110, kilometres, 70, mi,

was, centred, in, vilna, but, on, june, 24, couriers, rushed, news, about, the, crossing, of, the, niemen, to, barclay, de, tolley, before, the, night, had, passed, orders, were, sent, out, to, bagration, and, platov, who, commanded, the, cossacks, to, take, the, offensive, alexander, left, vilna, on, june, 26, and, barclay, assumed, overall, command, napoleon, reached, vilna, on, 28, june, with, only, light, skirmishing, but, leaving, more, than, 5, 000, dead, horses, in, his, wake, these, horses, were, vital, to, bringing, up, further, supplies, to, an, army, in, desperate, need, he, was, forced, to, leave, up, to, 100, guns, and, up, to, 500, artillery, wagons, napoleon, had, supposed, that, alexander, would, sue, for, peace, at, this, point, and, was, to, be, disappointed, it, would, not, be, his, last, disappointment, balashov, demanded, that, the, french, returned, across, the, niemen, before, negotiations, barclay, continued, to, retreat, to, drissa, deciding, that, the, concentration, of, the, 1st, and, 2nd, armies, was, his, first, priority, several, days, after, crossing, the, niemen, a, number, of, soldiers, began, to, develop, high, fevers, and, a, red, rash, on, their, bodies, typhus, had, made, its, appearance, on, 29, 30, june, a, violent, thunderstorm, struck, lithuania, during, the, night, and, continued, for, several, hours, or, a, day, the, results, were, most, disastrous, to, the, french, forces, the, movement, of, troops, was, impeded, or, absolutely, checked, and, the, vast, troop, and, supply, trains, on, the, vilnius, kaunas, road, became, disorganized, the, existing, roads, became, little, better, than, quagmires, causing, the, horses, to, break, down, under, the, additional, strain, the, delay, and, frequent, loss, of, these, supply, trains, caused, both, troops, and, horses, to, suffer, napoleon, s, forces, traditionally, were, well, supplied, by, his, transportation, corps, but, they, proved, inadequate, during, the, invasion,

to, destroy, the, 2nd, army, in, an, operation, before, reaching, minsk, this, operation, had, failed, to, produce, results, on, his, left, conflicting, orders, and, lack, of, information, had,

barclay, didn, t, know, and, left, bagration, without, a, clear, picture, of, what, was, expected, of, him, and, the, general, situation, this, stream, of, confused, orders, to, bagration, had, him, upset, with, barclay, which, would, have, repercussions, later, after, five, weeks, the, loss, of, troops, from, disease, and, desertion, had, reduced, napoleon, s, effective, fighting, strength, to, about, half, ney, and, his, corps, were, given, ten, days, to, recover, and, search, for, food, jakob, walter, describes, his, foraging, experience, during, russia, s, scorched, earth, tactics, finally, we, arrived, at, polotsk, a, large, city, on, the, other, side, of, the, western, dvina, river, in, this, region, i, once, left, the, bivouac, to, seek, provisions, there, were, eight, of, us, and, we, came, to, a, very, distant, village, here, we, searched, all, the, houses, there, were, no, peasants, left, i, later, realized, how, heedless, i, had, been, since, each, one, ran, into, a, house, alone, broke, open, everything, that, was, covered, and, searched, all, the, floors, and, still, nothing, was, found, finally, when, we, assembled, and, were, ready, to, leave, i, once, more, inspected, a, little, hut, somewhat, removed, from, the, village, around, it, from, top, to, bottom, were, heaped, bundles, of, hemp, and, shives, which, i, tore, down, and, as, i, worked, my, way, to, the, ground, sacks, full, of, flour, appeared, now, i, joyfully, called, all, my, comrades, so, that, we, might, dispose, of, the, booty, in, the, village, we, saw, sieves, these, we, took, to, sift, the, flour, mixed, with, chaff, an, inch, long, and, after, that, we, refilled, the, sacks, then, the, question, of, carrying, and, dividing, the, grain, arose, but, it, occurred, to, me, that, i, had, seen, a, horse, in, one, of, the, houses, everyone, immediately, hurried, to, find, the, horse, we, found, two, instead, of, one, but, unfortunately, they, were, both, colts, and, one, could, not, be, used, at, all, we, took, the, largest, placed, two, sacks, on, it, and, started, out, very, slowly, while, we, were, marching, there, the, russians, saw, us, from, a, distance, with, this, booty, and, at, the, same, moment, we, saw, a, troop, of, peasants, in, the, valley, about, fifty, these, ran, toward, us, what, could, we, do, but, shoot, at, them, exactly, at, midnight, on, july, 16, napoleon, left, vilnius, on, 19, july, the, tsar, left, the, army, in, polotsk, and, headed, for, moscow, taking, the, discredited, von, phull, with, him, barclay, the, russian, commander, in, chief, refused, to, fight, despite, bagration, s, urgings, several, times, he, attempted, to, establish, a, strong, defensive, position, but, each, time, the, french, advance, was, too, quick, for, him, to, finish, preparations, and, he, was, forced, to, retreat, once, more, when, the, french, army, progressed, further, under, conditions, of, extreme, heat, and, drought, rivers, and, wells, filled, with, carrion, it, encountered, serious, problems, in, foraging, aggravated, by, the, scorched, earth, tactics, of, the, russian, forces, from, smolensk, to, moshaisk, the, war, displayed, its, horrible, work, of, destruction, all, the, roads, fields, and, woods, lay, as, though, sown, with, people, horses, wagons, burned, villages, and, cities, everything, looked, like, the, complete, ruin, of, all, that, lived, in, particular, we, saw, ten, dead, russians, to, one, of, our, men, although, every, day, our, numbers, fell, off, considerably, in, order, to, pass, through, after, the, battle, of, vitebsk, napoleon, discovered, that, the, russians, were, able, to, slip, away, during, the, night, the, city, at, the, intersection, of, important, trade, routes, and, the, palace, of, alexander, of, w, rttemberg, would, be, his, base, for, the, next, two, weeks, his, army, needed, to, recover, and, rest, but, napoleon, asked, himself, what, to, do, next, according, to, antoine, henri, jomini, napoleon, planned, not, to, go, further, than, smolensk, and, make, vilnius, his, headquarters, for, the, winter, however, he, could, not, go, back, at, the, end, of, july, his, position, was, unfavourable, according, to, adam, zamoyski, there, was, the, heat, also, at, night, and, the, lack, of, supplies, he, had, lost, a, third, of, his, army, due, to, sickness, and, straggling, the, russo, turkish, war, 1806, 1812, had, come, to, an, end, as, kutuzov, signed, the, treaty, of, bucharest, and, the, russian, general, pavel, chichagov, headed, north, west, his, former, ally, bernadotte, broke, off, relations, with, france, and, entered, into, an, alliance, with, russia, treaty, of, rebro, mid, july, napoleon, s, brother, j, rome, resigned, and, decided, to, go, home, for, napoleon, he, lost, the, opportunity, to, destroy, the, russian, armies, separately, on, 4, august, the, corps, of, barclay, and, bagration, finally, succeeded, to, unite, in, smolensk, on, 5, august, they, held, a, council, of, war, under, pressure, barclay, de, tolly, decided, to, launch, an, offensive, the, french, army, arrived, on, russian, territory, before, the, partitions, of, poland, a, russian, force, was, sent, west, napoleon, hoped, that, the, russian, advance, would, lead, to, the, long, desired, battle, and, the, unification, of, the, russian, armies, forced, napoleon, to, change, his, plans, on, 14, august, ney, crossed, the, dniepr, and, won, the, first, battle, of, krasnoi, the, next, day, napoleon, celebrated, his, 43rd, birthday, with, a, review, of, the, army, in, the, late, afternoon, murat, s, cavalry, and, ney, s, infantry, closed, up, to, the, western, side, of, smolensk, the, main, body, of, the, army, did, not, come, up, until, late, the, next, day, the, battle, of, smolensk, 1812, on, august, 16, 18, became, the, first, real, confrontation, napoleon, surrounded, the, southern, bank, of, the, dniepr, while, the, northern, bank, was, guarded, by, barclay, s, army, when, bagration, moved, further, east, to, prevent, the, french, from, crossing, the, river, and, attacking, the, russians, from, behind, napoleon, began, the, attack, on, the, smolensk, kremlin, in, the, evening, in, the, middle, of, the, night, barclay, de, tolly, withdrew, his, troops, from, the, burning, city, to, avoid, a, big, battle, with, no, chance, of, victory, when, the, french, army, moved, in, the, russians, left, on, the, east, side, ney, junot, and, oudinot, tried, to, halt, their, army, the, battle, of, valutino, could, have, been, decisive, but, the, russians, succeeded, to, escape, via, a, diversion, on, the, road, to, moscow, the, french, discussed, their, options, or, prepare, for, a, new, attack, after, winter, napoleon, pressed, his, army, on, after, the, russians, murat, implored, him, to, stop, but, napoleon, could, see, nothing, but, moscow, after, five, or, six, days, napoleon, invited, the, wounded, tuchkov, to, write, the, tsar, his, readiness, for, peace, negotiations, then, the, general, was, sent, to, paris, as, honorary, prisoner, on, 24, august, the, grande, arm, e, marched, out, on, the, old, smolensk, road, 30, feet, wide, eugene, on, the, left, poniatowski, on, the, right, and, murat, in, the, centre, with, the, emperor, the, guard, i, corps, and, iii, corps, in, the, second, line, joseph, barban, gre, was, appointed, commander, of, the, devastated, city, and, had, to, organise, new, supplies, meanwhile, wittgenstein, was, forced, to, retreat, to, the, north, after, the, first, battle, of, polotsk, bagration, asked, aleksey, arakcheyev, to, organize, the, militia, as, barclay, had, led, the, french, right, into, the, capital, political, pressure, on, barclay, to, give, battle, and, the, general, s, continuing, reluctance, to, do, so, led, to, his, removal, after, the, defeat, on, 20, august, he, was, replaced, in, his, position, as, commander, in, chief, by, the, popular, veteran, mikhail, kutuzov, the, former, head, of, the, st, petersburg, militia, and, a, member, of, the, state, council, arrived, on, the, 29th, at, tsaryovo, zaymishche, a, border, village, the, weather, was, still, unbearably, hot, and, kutuzov, went, on, with, barclay, s, successful, strategy, using, attrition, warfare, instead, of, risking, the, army, in, an, open, battle, napoleon, s, superiority, in, numbers, was, almost, eliminated, the, russian, army, fell, back, ever, deeper, into, russia, s, empty, and, forested, interior, as, napoleon, continued, to, move, east, unable, because, of, political, pressure, to, give, up, moscow, without, a, fight, kutuzov, took, up, a, defensive, position, some, 120, kilometres, 75, mi, before, moscow, at, borodino, the, battle, of, borodino, fought, on, 7, september, 1812, was, the, largest, battle, of, the, french, invasion, of, russia, involving, more, than, 250, 000, troops, and, resulting, in, at, least, 70, 000, casualties, the, grande, arm, e, attacked, the, imperial, russian, army, near, the, village, of, borodino, west, of, the, town, of, mozhaysk, and, eventually, captured, the, main, positions, on, the, battlefield, but, failed, to, destroy, the, russian, army, about, a, third, of, napoleon, s, soldiers, were, killed, or, wounded, russian, losses, while, heavier, could, be, replaced, due, to, russia, s, large, population, since, napoleon, s, campaign, took, place, on, russian, soil, the, battle, ended, with, the, russian, army, while, out, of, position, still, offering, resistance, the, state, of, exhaustion, of, the, french, forces, and, the, lack, of, recognition, of, the, state, of, the, russian, army, led, napoleon, to, remain, on, the, battlefield, with, his, army, instead, of, engaging, in, the, forced, pursuit, that, had, marked, other, campaigns, that, he, had, conducted, the, entirety, of, the, guard, was, still, available, to, napoleon, and, in, refusing, to, use, it, he, lost, this, singular, chance, to, destroy, the, russian, army, borodino, was, a, pivotal, point, in, the, campaign, as, it, was, the, last, offensive, action, fought, by, napoleon, in, russia, by, withdrawing, the, russian, army, preserved, its, combat, strength, eventually, allowing, it, to, force, napoleon, out, of, the, country, borodino, was, the, bloodiest, day, of, battle, in, the, napoleonic, wars, the, russian, army, could, only, muster, half, of, its, strength, on, september, 8, kutuzov, chose, to, act, in, accordance, with, his, scorched, earth, tactics, and, retreat, leaving, the, road, to, moscow, open, kutuzov, also, ordered, the, evacuation, of, the, city, by, this, point, the, russians, had, managed, to, draft, large, numbers, of, reinforcements, volunteers, into, the, army, bringing, the, russian, army, to, their, peak, strength, in, 1812, of, 904, 000, with, perhaps, 100, 000, in, the, vicinity, of, moscow, the, remnants, of, kutuzov, s, army, from, borodino, partially, reinforced, both, armies, began, to, move, and, rebuild, the, russian, retreat, was, significant, for, two, reasons, firstly, the, move, was, to, the, south, and, not, the, east, secondly, the, russians, immediately, began, operations, that, would, continue, to, deplete, the, french, forces, platov, commanding, the, rear, guard, on, september, 8, offered, such, strong, resistance, that, napoleon, remained, on, the, borodino, field, on, the, following, day, miloradovich, assumed, command, of, the, rear, guard, adding, his, forces, to, the, formation, on, 8, september, the, russian, army, began, retreating, east, from, borodino, they, camped, outside, mozhaysk, when, the, village, of, mozhaysk, was, captured, by, the, french, on, the, 9th, the, grande, arm, e, rested, for, two, days, to, recover, napoleon, asked, berthier, to, send, reinforcements, from, smolensk, to, moscow, and, from, minsk, to, smolensk, the, french, army, began, to, move, out, on, september, 10, with, the, still, ill, napoleon, not, leaving, until, the, 12th, some, 18, 000, men, were, ordered, in, from, smolensk, and, marshal, victor, s, corps, supplied, another, 25, 000, on, 10, september, the, main, quarter, of, the, russian, army, was, situated, at, bolshiye, vyazyomy, kutuzov, settled, in, a, vyazyomy, manor, on, the, high, road, to, moscow, the, owner, was, dmitry, golitsyn, who, entered, military, service, again, the, next, day, tsar, alexander, signed, a, document, that, kutuzov, was, promoted, general, field, marshal, the, highest, military, rank, of, the, imperial, russian, army, russian, sources, suggest, kutuzov, wrote, a, number, of, orders, and, letters, to, rostopchin, the, moscow, military, governor, about, saving, the, city, or, the, army, on, 12, september, 1812, the, main, forces, of, kutuzov, departed, from, the, village, now, golitsyno, and, camped, near, odintsovo, 20, km, to, the, west, followed, by, mortier, and, joachim, murat, s, vanguard, napoleon, who, suffered, from, a, cold, and, lost, his, voice, spent, the, night, at, vyazyomy, manor, on, the, same, sofa, in, the, library, within, 24, hours, on, sunday, afternoon, the, russian, military, council, at, fili, discussed, the, risks, and, agreed, to, abandon, moscow, without, fighting, leo, tolstoy, wrote, fyodor, rostopchin, was, invited, also, and, explained, the, difficult, decision, in, quite, a, few, remarkable, chapters, in, his, book, war, and, peace, this, came, at, the, price, of, losing, moscow, whose, population, was, evacuated, miloradovich, would, not, give, up, his, rearguard, duties, until, september, 14, allowing, moscow, to, be, evacuated, miloradovich, finally, retreated, under, a, flag, of, truce, kutuzov, withdrew, to, the, southeast, of, moscow, on, september, 14, 1812, napoleon, moved, into, moscow, however, he, was, surprised, to, have, received, no, delegation, from, the, city, before, the, order, was, received, to, evacuate, moscow, the, city, had, a, population, of, approximately, 270, 000, people, 48, hours, later, three, quarters, of, moscow, was, reduced, to, ashes, by, arson, a, french, army, foot, soldier, recalled, on, the, march, into, the, city, or, rather, on, the, march, toward, it, from, a, hill, in, a, forest, an, hour, and, a, half, away, we, saw, the, huge, city, lying, before, us, clouds, of, fire, red, smoke, great, gilded, crosses, of, the, church, towers, glittered, shimmered, and, billowed, up, toward, us, from, the, city, there, were, broad, streets, long, straight, alleys, tall, buildings, massively, built, of, brick, church, towers, with, burned, roofs, and, half, melted, bells, and, copper, roofs, which, had, rolled, from, the, buildings, everything, was, uninhabited, and, uninhabitable, although, saint, petersburg, was, the, political, capital, at, that, time, napoleon, had, occupied, moscow, the, spiritual, capital, of, russia, but, alexander, i, decided, that, there, could, not, be, peaceful, coexistence, with, napoleon, there, would, be, no, appeasement, on, 19, september, murat, lost, sight, of, kutuzov, who, changed, direction, and, turned, west, to, podolsk, and, tarutino, where, he, would, be, more, protected, by, the, surrounding, hills, and, the, nara, river, on, 3, october, kutuzov, and, his, entire, staff, arrived, at, tarutino, and, camped, there, for, two, weeks, he, controlled, the, three, pronged, roads, from, obninsk, to, kaluga, and, medyn, so, that, napoleon, could, not, turn, south, or, southwest, this, position, not, only, allowed, him, to, harass, the, french, lines, of, communication, but, also, stay, in, contact, with, the, russian, forces, under, tormasov, and, chichagov, commander, of, the, army, of, the, danube, he, was, also, well, placed, to, watch, over, the, workshops, and, arms, factories, in, nearby, tula, and, briansk, kutuzov, s, food, supplies, and, reinforcements, were, mostly, coming, up, through, kaluga, from, the, fertile, and, populous, southern, provinces, his, new, deployment, gave, him, every, opportunity, to, feed, his, men, and, horses, and, rebuild, their, strength, he, refused, to, attack, he, was, happy, for, napoleon, to, stay, in, moscow, for, as, long, as, possible, avoiding, complicated, movements, and, manoeuvres, kutuzov, avoided, frontal, battles, involving, large, masses, of, troops, in, order, to, reinforce, his, army, and, to, wait, there, for, napoleon, s, retreat, this, tactic, was, sharply, criticised, by, chief, of, staff, bennigsen, and, others, but, also, by, tsar, alexander, barclay, de, tolly, interrupted, his, service, for, five, months, and, settled, in, nizhny, novgorod, each, side, avoided, the, other, and, seemed, no, longer, to, wish, to, get, into, a, fight, on, 5, october, on, order, of, napoleon, the, french, ambassador, jacques, lauriston, left, moscow, to, meet, kutuzov, at, his, headquarters, kutuzov, agreed, to, meet, despite, the, orders, of, the, tsar, on, 10, october, murat, complained, to, belliard, about, the, lack, of, food, and, fodder, each, day, he, lost, 200, men, captured, by, russians, on, 18, october, at, dawn, during, breakfast, murat, s, camp, in, a, forest, was, surprised, by, an, attack, by, forces, led, by, bennigsen, known, as, battle, of, winkovo, bennigsen, was, supported, by, kutuzov, from, his, headquarters, at, distance, bennigsen, asked, kutuzov, to, provide, troops, for, the, pursuit, however, kutuzov, refused, as, the, tsar, remained, unresponsive, and, napoleon, took, advantage, of, the, unusually, fine, and, warm, weather, lasting, into, october, he, lingered, in, moscow, beyond, his, welcome, after, five, weeks, the, french, army, finally, left, the, city, on, 19, october, a, rainy, day, despite, still, numbering, 108, 000, strong, napoleon, s, forces, suffered, a, significant, blow, with, the, near, destruction, of, murat, s, cavalry, in, the, battle, of, tarutino, lacking, clear, direction, or, adequate, supplies, the, army, began, its, retreat, from, the, region, facing, the, prospect, of, even, worse, disasters, ahead, napoleon, traveled, along, the, old, kaluga, road, heading, south, in, search, of, untouched, prosperous, territories, his, goal, was, to, avoid, the, destruction, caused, on, the, previous, eastward, march, opting, instead, for, alternative, routes, particularly, the, westward, path, through, medyn, evading, kutuzov, became, napoleon, s, main, priority, but, he, encountered, an, obstacle, in, his, progress, the, battle, of, maloyaroslavets, a, testament, to, kutuzov, s, strategic, acumen, forced, the, french, army, to, retrace, its, steps, along, the, old, smolensk, road, reversing, their, previous, eastward, advance, kutuzov, s, tactical, brilliance, extended, further, as, he, employed, partisan, tactics, repeatedly, striking, at, vulnerable, points, to, prevent, any, potential, southern, retreat, as, the, french, retreat, devolved, into, chaos, bands, of, cossacks, under, matvei, platov, vasily, orlov, denisov, and, denis, davydov, along, with, agile, russian, cavalry, launched, relentless, assaults, on, isolated, french, units, foraging, for, supplies, maintaining, a, fully, supplied, army, became, an, insurmountable, challenge, due, to, the, vast, stretches, of, uninterrupted, forests, the, absence, of, grazing, fields, and, fodder, took, a, heavy, toll, on, the, surviving, horses, resulting, in, the, demise, of, nearly, all, of, them, due, to, either, starvation, or, their, use, as, sustenance, by, starving, soldiers, depleted, of, their, mounts, the, french, cavalry, faced, dissolution, compelling, generals, and, troopers, alike, to, proceed, on, foot, the, scarcity, of, horses, also, forced, the, abandonment, of, numerous, cannons, limbers, and, caissons, a, loss, that, significantly, weakened, napoleon, s, forces, in, subsequent, campaigns, a, wagon, or, a, piece, of, artillery, could, not, be, transported, across, even, the, smallest, ravine, without, the, loss, of, 12, to, 15, horses, starvation, and, disease, ravaged, the, troops, exacerbating, their, already, dire, circumstances, defeats, at, vyazma, polotsk, and, krasny, further, diminished, the, strength, of, the, grande, arm, e, in, a, letter, to, emperor, francis, i, of, austria, his, father, in, law, napoleon, would, later, lament, these, setbacks, the, story, of, the, krasnoye, affair, where, i, was, said, to, have, retired, at, a, gallop, is, a, flat, fabrication, the, so, called, viceroy, affair, is, false, it, s, true, that, from, november, 7th, to, the, 16th, with, the, thermometer, falling, to, 18, and, even, 22, degrees, 30, 000, of, my, cavalry, and, artillery, horses, died, i, abandoned, several, thousand, ambulance, wagons, and, baggage, cars, for, lack, of, horses, the, roads, were, covered, in, ice, in, this, terrible, cold, storm, the, bivouac, became, unbearable, for, my, people, many, moved, away, in, the, evening, in, search, of, houses, and, shelter, i, had, no, cavalry, left, to, protect, them, the, cossacks, picked, up, several, thousand, russian, forces, also, seized, control, of, the, french, supply, depots, at, polotsk, vitebsk, and, minsk, dealing, a, severe, blow, to, napoleon, s, already, faltering, campaign, however, the, convergence, of, forces, led, by, victor, oudinot, and, dombrowski, at, the, bobr, bolstered, the, numerical, strength, of, the, grande, arm, e, back, up, to, approximately, 49, 000, french, combatants, alongside, some, 40, 000, stragglers, despite, this, reinforcement, as, all, french, corps, advanced, towards, borisov, they, encountered, another, critical, obstacle, the, strategic, bridge, needed, to, cross, the, berezina, river, had, been, destroyed, by, the, russian, army, the, ensuing, battle, of, berezina, marked, the, campaign, s, final, significant, engagement, and, proved, to, be, a, disastrous, culmination, for, the, french, compounding, their, plight, the, onset, of, thaw, caused, the, ice, to, melt, necessitating, the, construction, of, two, bridges, from, a, military, standpoint, the, subsequent, escape, could, be, deemed, a, strategic, victory, for, the, french, albeit, amidst, substantial, losses, however, it, also, represented, a, missed, opportunity, for, the, russians, who, laid, blame, on, pavel, chichagov, for, his, failure, to, fully, capitalize, on, the, situation, on, 3, december, napoleon, published, the, 29th, bulletin, in, which, he, informed, the, outside, world, for, the, first, time, of, the, catastrophic, state, of, his, army, he, abandoned, the, army, on, 5, december, and, returned, home, on, a, sled, leaving, the, sick, murat, in, command, in, the, following, weeks, the, grande, arm, e, shrank, further, and, on, 14, december, 1812, it, left, russian, territory, following, the, campaign, a, saying, arose, that, general, winter, defeated, napoleon, alluding, to, the, russian, winter, minard, s, map, shows, that, the, opposite, is, true, as, the, french, losses, were, highest, in, the, summer, and, autumn, due, to, inadequate, preparation, of, logistics, resulting, in, insufficient, supplies, while, many, troops, were, also, killed, by, disease, thus, the, outcome, of, the, campaign, was, decided, long, before, the, cold, weather, became, a, factor, when, winter, arrived, on, 6, november, with, a, blizzard, the, army, was, still, equipped, with, summer, clothing, and, did, not, have, the, means, to, protect, themselves, from, the, cold, or, snow, it, had, also, failed, to, forge, caulkin, shoes, for, the, horses, to, enable, them, to, traverse, roads, that, had, become, iced, over, the, most, devastating, effect, of, the, cold, weather, upon, napoleon, s, forces, occurred, during, their, retreat, starvation, and, gangrene, coupled, with, hypothermia, led, to, the, loss, of, tens, of, thousands, of, men, heavy, artillery, pieces, loot, and, wagons, were, abandoned, as, irreplaceable, draft, animals, perished, the, intense, cold, enfeebled, the, brains, of, those, whose, health, had, already, suffered, especially, of, those, who, had, had, dysentery, but, soon, while, the, cold, increased, daily, its, pernicious, effect, was, noticed, in, all, in, his, memoir, napoleon, s, close, adviser, armand, de, caulaincourt, recounted, scenes, of, massive, loss, and, offered, a, vivid, description, of, mass, death, through, hypothermia, the, cold, was, so, intense, that, bivouacking, was, no, longer, supportable, bad, luck, to, those, who, fell, asleep, by, a, campfire, furthermore, disorganization, was, perceptibly, gaining, ground, in, the, guard, one, constantly, found, men, who, overcome, by, the, cold, had, been, forced, to, drop, out, and, had, fallen, to, the, ground, too, weak, or, too, numb, to, stand, ought, one, to, help, them, along, which, practically, meant, carrying, them, they, begged, one, to, let, them, alone, there, were, bivouacs, all, along, the, road, ought, one, to, take, them, to, a, campfire, once, these, poor, wretches, fell, asleep, they, were, dead, if, they, resisted, the, craving, for, sleep, another, passer, by, would, help, them, along, a, little, farther, thus, prolonging, their, agony, for, a, short, while, but, not, saving, them, for, in, this, condition, the, drowsiness, engendered, by, cold, is, irresistibly, strong, this, befell, a, grande, arm, e, that, was, ill, equipped, for, cold, weather, the, french, deficiencies, in, equipment, caused, by, the, assumption, that, their, campaign, would, be, concluded, before, the, cold, weather, set, in, were, a, large, factor, in, the, number, of, casualties, they, suffered, after, a, few, days, of, thaw, the, temperature, dropped, again, 23, november, from, the, berezina, the, retreat, was, nothing, but, utter, flight, the, preservation, of, war, materiel, and, military, positions, was, no, longer, considered, when, the, night, time, temperature, dropped, to, minus, 35, degrees, celsius, it, proved, catastrophic, for, loison, s, untried, soldiers, some, suffered, from, snow, blindness, within, three, days, his, division, of, 15, 000, soldiers, lost, 12, 000, men, without, a, battle, in, napoleon, s, russian, campaign, riehn, sums, up, the, limitations, of, napoleon, s, logistics, as, follows, the, military, machine, napoleon, the, artilleryman, had, created, was, perfectly, suited, to, fight, short, violent, campaigns, but, whenever, a, long, term, sustained, effort, was, in, the, offing, it, tended, to, expose, feet, of, clay, in, the, end, the, logistics, of, the, french, military, machine, proved, wholly, inadequate, the, experiences, of, short, campaigns, had, left, the, french, supply, services, completed, unprepared, for, russia, and, this, was, despite, the, precautions, napoleon, had, taken, there, was, no, quick, remedy, that, might, have, repaired, these, inadequacies, from, one, campaign, to, the, next, the, limitations, of, horse, drawn, transport, and, the, road, networks, to, support, it, were, simply, not, up, to, the, task, indeed, modern, militaries, have, long, been, in, agreement, that, napoleon, s, military, machine, at, its, apex, and, the, scale, on, which, he, attempted, to, operate, with, it, in, 1812, and, 1813, had, become, an, anachronism, that, could, succeed, only, with, the, use, of, railroads, and, the, telegraph, and, these, had, not, yet, been, invented, napoleon, lacked, the, apparatus, to, efficiently, move, so, many, troops, across, such, large, distances, of, hostile, territory, the, french, supply, depots, established, in, the, russian, interior, failed, in, their, purpose, as, supplies, could, not, be, distributed, quickly, enough, the, french, train, battalions, did, their, best, but, the, distances, the, speed, required, and, the, poor, conditions, they, labored, under, meant, that, the, demands, napoleon, placed, on, them, were, too, great, napoleon, s, demand, of, a, speedy, advance, by, the, grande, arm, e, over, a, network, of, dirt, roads, that, dissolved, into, deep, mires, further, broke, down, his, logistical, network, as, weakened, draft, animals, collapsed, from, overwork, and, vehicles, that, could, not, be, repaired, broke, down, as, the, graph, of, charles, joseph, minard, given, below, shows, the, grande, arm, e, incurred, the, majority, of, its, losses, during, the, march, to, moscow, during, the, summer, and, autumn, on, 24, june, 1812, around, 400, 000, 500, 000, men, of, the, grande, arm, e, the, largest, army, assembled, up, to, that, point, in, european, history, crossed, the, border, into, russia, and, headed, towards, moscow, anthony, joes, wrote, in, the, journal, of, conflict, studies, that, figures, on, how, many, men, napoleon, took, into, russia, and, how, many, eventually, came, out, vary, widely, georges, lefebvre, says, that, napoleon, crossed, the, niemen, with, over, 600, 000, soldiers, only, half, of, whom, were, from, france, the, others, being, mainly, poles, and, germans, felix, markham, thinks, that, 450, 000, crossed, the, neman, on, 25, june, 1812, when, ney, and, the, rearguard, recrossed, the, niemen, on, december, 14, he, had, barely, a, thousand, men, fit, for, action, james, marshall, cornwall, says, 510, 000, imperial, troops, entered, russia, eugene, tarle, believes, that, 420, 000, crossed, with, napoleon, and, 150, 000, eventually, followed, for, a, grand, total, of, 570, 000, richard, k, riehn, provides, the, following, figures, 685, 000, men, marched, into, russia, in, 1812, of, whom, around, 355, 000, were, french, 31, 000, soldiers, marched, out, again, in, some, sort, of, military, formation, with, perhaps, another, 35, 000, stragglers, for, a, total, of, fewer, than, 70, 000, known, survivors, adam, zamoyski, estimated, that, between, 550, 000, and, 600, 000, french, and, allied, troops, including, reinforcements, operated, beyond, the, niemen, of, which, as, many, as, 400, 000, troops, died, but, this, includes, deaths, of, prisoners, during, captivity, minard, s, famous, infographic, see, below, depicts, the, march, ingeniously, by, showing, the, size, of, the, advancing, army, overlaid, on, a, rough, map, as, well, as, the, retreating, soldiers, together, with, temperatures, recorded, as, much, as, 30, below, zero, on, the, r, aumur, scale, 38, c, 36, f, on, their, return, the, numbers, on, this, chart, have, 422, 000, crossing, the, neman, with, napoleon, 22, 000, taking, a, side, trip, early, on, in, the, campaign, 100, 000, surviving, the, battles, en, route, to, moscow, and, returning, from, there, only, 4, 000, survive, the, march, back, to, be, joined, by, 6, 000, that, survived, from, that, initial, 22, 000, in, the, feint, attack, northward, in, the, end, only, 10, 000, crossed, the, neman, back, out, of, the, initial, 422, 000, barclay, de, tolly, the, minister, of, war, and, field, commander, of, the, first, western, army, and, general, of, infantry, served, as, the, commander, in, chief, of, the, russian, armies, according, to, tolstoy, in, war, and, peace, book, x, he, was, unpopular, and, regarded, as, a, foreigner, by, bagration, who, was, higher, in, rank, but, had, to, follow, his, orders, kutuzov, replaced, barclay, and, acted, as, commander, in, chief, during, the, retreat, following, the, battle, of, smolensk, these, forces, however, could, count, on, reinforcements, from, the, second, line, which, totalled, 129, 000, men, and, 8, 000, cossacks, with, 434, guns, and, 433, rounds, of, ammunition, of, these, about, 105, 000, men, were, actually, available, for, the, defence, against, the, invasion, in, the, third, line, were, the, 36, recruit, depots, and, militias, which, came, to, a, total, of, approximately, 161, 000, men, of, various, and, highly, disparate, military, values, of, which, about, 133, 000, actually, took, part, in, the, defence, thus, the, grand, total, of, all, the, forces, was, 488, 000, men, of, which, about, 428, 000, gradually, came, into, action, against, the, grande, armee, this, bottom, line, however, includes, more, than, 80, 000, cossacks, and, militiamen, as, well, as, about, 20, 000, men, who, garrisoned, the, fortresses, in, the, operational, area, the, majority, of, the, officer, corps, came, from, the, aristocracy, about, 7, of, the, officer, corps, came, from, the, baltic, german, nobility, from, the, governorates, of, estonia, and, livonia, because, the, baltic, german, nobles, tended, to, be, better, educated, than, the, ethnic, russian, nobility, the, baltic, germans, were, often, favoured, with, positions, in, high, command, and, various, technical, positions, the, russian, empire, had, no, universal, educational, system, and, those, who, could, afford, it, had, to, hire, tutors, or, send, their, children, to, private, schools, the, educational, level, of, the, russian, nobility, and, gentry, varied, enormously, depending, on, the, quality, of, the, tutors, and, private, schools, with, some, russian, nobles, being, extremely, well, educated, while, others, were, just, barely, literate, the, baltic, german, nobility, was, more, inclined, to, invest, in, their, children, s, education, than, the, ethnic, russian, nobility, which, led, to, the, government, favouring, them, when, granting, officers, commissions, of, the, 800, doctors, in, the, russian, army, in, 1812, almost, all, of, them, were, baltic, germans, the, british, historian, dominic, lieven, noted, that, at, the, time, the, russian, elite, defined, russianness, in, terms, of, loyalty, to, the, house, of, romanov, rather, in, terms, of, language, or, culture, and, as, the, baltic, german, aristocrats, were, very, loyal, they, were, considered, and, considered, themselves, to, be, russian, despite, speaking, german, as, their, first, language, sweden, russia, s, only, ally, did, not, send, supporting, troops, but, the, alliance, made, it, possible, to, withdraw, the, 45, 000, man, russian, corps, steinheil, from, finland, and, use, it, in, the, later, battles, 20, 000, men, were, sent, to, riga, and, polotsk, napoleon, lost, more, than, 500, 000, men, in, russia, out, of, an, original, force, of, 615, 000, only, 110, 000, frostbitten, and, half, starved, survivors, stumbled, back, desgenettes, took, care, of, wounded, marshall, lefebvre, arrived, with, louise, fusil, who, was, one, of, the, few, women, who, survived, the, retreat, it, is, questionable, if, ida, saint, elme, courtisane, de, la, grande, arm, e, was, another, one, it, is, estimated, that, of, the, 612, 000, combatants, who, entered, russia, only, 112, 000, returned, to, the, frontier, among, the, casualties, 100, 000, are, thought, to, have, been, killed, in, action, 200, 000, to, have, died, from, other, causes, 50, 000, to, have, been, left, sick, in, hospitals, 50, 000, to, have, deserted, and, 100, 000, to, have, been, taken, as, prisoners, of, war, the, french, themselves, lost, 70, 000, in, action, and, 120, 000, wounded, as, against, the, non, french, contingents, 30, 000, and, 60, 000, russian, casualties, have, been, estimated, at, 200, 000, killed, 50, 000, dispersed, or, deserting, and, 150, 000, wounded, recent, russian, studies, show, that, russians, captured, over, 110, 000, prisoners, during, the, six, month, long, campaign, the, harsh, winter, as, well, as, popular, violence, malnutrition, sickness, and, hardships, during, transportation, meant, that, two, thirds, of, these, men, and, women, perished, within, weeks, of, captivity, official, reports, from, forty, eight, russian, provinces, reveal, that, 65, 503, prisoners, had, died, in, russia, by, february, 1813, other, 39, 645, were, still, held, prisoner, by, the, same, date, including, a, group, of, 50, women, and, 7, children, hay, has, argued, that, the, destruction, of, the, dutch, contingent, 15, 000, of, the, grande, arm, e, was, not, a, result, of, the, death, of, most, of, its, members, rather, its, various, units, disintegrated, and, the, troops, scattered, later, some, of, its, personnel, were, collected, and, reorganised, into, the, new, dutch, army, most, of, the, prussian, contingent, survived, thanks, to, the, convention, of, tauroggen, and, almost, the, whole, austrian, contingent, under, schwarzenberg, withdrew, successfully, the, russians, formed, the, russian, german, legion, from, other, german, prisoners, and, deserters, russian, casualties, in, the, few, open, battles, are, comparable, to, the, french, losses, but, civilian, losses, along, the, devastating, campaign, route, were, much, higher, than, the, military, casualties, in, total, despite, earlier, estimates, giving, figures, of, several, million, dead, around, one, million, were, killed, including, civilians, fairly, evenly, split, between, the, french, and, russians, military, losses, amounted, to, 300, 000, french, about, 72, 000, poles, 50, 000, italians, 80, 000, germans, and, 61, 000, from, 16, other, nations, as, well, as, the, loss, of, human, life, the, french, also, lost, some, 150, 000, horses, and, over, 1, 300, artillery, pieces, the, losses, of, the, russian, armies, are, difficult, to, assess, the, 19th, century, historian, michael, bogdanovich, assessed, reinforcements, of, the, russian, armies, during, the, war, using, the, military, registry, archives, of, the, general, staff, according, to, this, the, reinforcements, totalled, 134, 000, men, the, main, army, at, the, time, of, capture, of, vilna, in, december, had, 70, 000, men, whereas, its, number, at, the, start, of, the, invasion, had, been, about, 150, 000, thus, total, losses, would, come, to, 210, 000, men, of, these, about, 40, 000, returned, to, duty, losses, of, the, formations, operating, in, secondary, areas, of, operations, as, well, as, losses, in, militia, units, were, about, 40, 000, thus, he, came, up, with, the, number, of, 210, 000, men, and, militiamen, according, to, dominic, lieven, russian, espionage, alexander, chernyshyov, karl, nesselrode, was, well, organized, the, russian, light, cavalry, was, superior, from, the, start, with, a, good, supply, of, horses, the, musketeers, were, not, the, russian, victory, over, the, french, army, in, 1812, was, a, significant, blow, to, napoleon, s, ambitions, of, european, dominance, this, war, was, the, reason, the, other, coalition, allies, triumphed, once, and, for, all, over, napoleon, his, army, was, shattered, and, morale, was, low, both, for, french, troops, still, in, russia, fighting, battles, just, before, the, campaign, ended, and, for, the, troops, on, other, fronts, napoleon, alone, was, able, to, maintain, any, semblance, of, order, with, his, disappearance, murat, and, the, other, officers, lost, all, authority, in, january, 1813, the, french, army, gathered, behind, the, vistula, some, 23, 000, strong, the, austrian, and, prussian, troops, mustered, some, 35, 000, men, in, addition, the, number, of, deserters, and, stragglers, having, left, russia, alive, is, unknown, by, definition, the, number, of, new, inhabitants, of, russia, is, unknown, the, number, of, prisoners, is, estimated, at, around, 100, 000, of, whom, more, than, 50, 000, died, in, captivity, the, war, of, the, sixth, coalition, started, in, 1813, as, the, russian, campaign, was, decisive, for, the, napoleonic, wars, and, led, to, napoleon, s, defeat, and, exile, on, the, island, of, elba, for, russia, the, term, patriotic, war, an, english, rendition, of, the, russian, became, a, symbol, for, a, strengthened, national, identity, that, had, a, great, effect, on, russian, patriotism, in, the, 19th, century, a, series, of, revolutions, followed, starting, with, the, decembrist, revolt, of, 1825, and, ending, with, the, february, revolution, of, 1917, the, british, historian, dominic, lieven, wrote, that, much, of, the, historiography, about, the, campaign, for, various, reasons, distorts, the, story, of, the, russian, war, against, france, in, 1812, 14, the, number, of, western, historians, who, are, fluent, in, french, or, german, vastly, outnumbers, those, who, are, fluent, in, russian, which, has, the, effect, that, many, western, historians, simply, ignore, russian, language, sources, when, writing, about, the, campaign, because, they, cannot, read, them, according, to, von, lieven, memoirs, written, by, french, veterans, of, the, campaign, together, with, much, of, the, work, done, by, french, historians, show, the, influence, of, orientalism, which, depicted, russia, as, a, strange, backward, exotic, and, barbaric, asian, nation, that, was, intrinsically, inferior, to, the, west, especially, france, the, picture, drawn, by, the, french, is, that, of, a, vastly, superior, army, being, defeated, by, geography, the, climate, and, just, plain, bad, fortune, german, language, sources, are, not, as, hostile, to, the, russians, as, french, sources, but, many, of, the, prussian, officers, such, as, carl, von, clausewitz, who, did, not, speak, russian, who, joined, the, russian, army, to, fight, against, the, french, found, service, with, a, foreign, army, both, frustrating, and, strange, and, their, accounts, reflected, these, experiences, lieven, compared, those, historians, who, use, clausewitz, s, account, of, his, time, in, russian, service, as, their, main, source, for, the, 1812, campaign, to, those, historians, who, might, use, an, account, written, by, a, free, french, officer, who, did, not, speak, english, who, served, with, the, british, army, in, world, war, ii, as, their, main, source, for, the, british, war, effort, in, the, second, world, war, in, russia, the, official, historical, line, until, 1917, was, that, the, peoples, of, the, russian, empire, had, rallied, together, in, defence, of, the, throne, against, a, foreign, invader, because, many, of, the, younger, russian, officers, in, the, 1812, campaign, took, part, in, the, decembrist, uprising, of, 1825, their, roles, in, history, were, erased, at, the, order, of, emperor, nicholas, i, likewise, because, many, of, the, officers, who, were, also, veterans, who, stayed, loyal, during, the, decembrist, uprising, went, on, to, become, ministers, in, the, tyrannical, regime, of, emperor, nicholas, i, they, had, a, negative, reputation, among, the, radical, intelligentsia, of, 19th, century, russia, for, example, count, alexander, von, benckendorff, is, thought, by, von, lievewn, to, have, achieved, good, results, militarily, in, 1812, commanding, a, cossack, company, but, because, he, later, become, the, chief, of, the, third, section, of, his, imperial, majesty, s, chancellery, as, the, secret, police, were, called, was, one, of, the, closest, friends, of, nicholas, i, and, is, infamous, for, his, persecution, of, russia, s, national, poet, alexander, pushkin, he, is, not, well, remembered, in, russia, and, his, role, in, 1812, is, usually, ignored, furthermore, the, 19th, century, was, a, great, age, of, nationalism, and, there, was, a, tendency, by, historians, in, the, allied, nations, to, give, the, lion, s, share, of, the, credit, for, defeating, france, to, their, own, respective, nation, with, british, historians, claiming, that, it, was, the, united, kingdom, that, played, the, most, important, role, in, defeating, napoleon, austrian, historians, giving, that, honour, to, their, nation, russian, historians, writing, that, it, was, russia, that, played, the, greatest, role, in, the, victory, and, prussian, and, later, german, historians, writing, that, it, was, prussia, that, made, the, difference, in, such, a, context, various, historians, liked, to, diminish, the, contributions, of, their, allies, von, lieven, s, account, doesn, t, mention, the, influence, of, polish, national, feeling, on, convictions, concerning, the, war, which, were, also, significant, also, in, the, aftermath, leo, tolstoy, was, not, a, historian, but, his, popular, 1869, historical, novel, war, and, peace, which, depicted, the, war, as, a, triumph, of, what, lieven, called, the, moral, strength, courage, and, patriotism, of, ordinary, russians, with, military, leadership, a, negligible, factor, has, shaped, the, popular, understanding, of, the, war, in, both, russia, and, abroad, from, the, 19th, century, onward, a, recurring, theme, of, war, and, peace, is, that, certain, events, are, just, fated, to, happen, and, there, is, nothing, that, a, leader, can, do, to, challenge, destiny, a, view, of, history, that, dramatically, discounts, leadership, as, a, factor, in, history, during, the, soviet, period, historians, engaged, in, what, lieven, called, huge, distortions, to, make, history, fit, with, communist, ideology, with, marshal, kutuzov, and, prince, bagration, transformed, into, peasant, generals, alexander, i, alternatively, ignored, or, vilified, and, the, war, becoming, a, massive, people, s, war, fought, by, the, ordinary, people, of, russia, with, almost, no, involvement, on, the, part, of, the, government, during, the, cold, war, many, western, historians, were, inclined, to, see, russia, as, the, enemy, and, there, was, a, tendency, to, downplay, and, dismiss, russia, s, contributions, to, the, defeat, of, napoleon, as, such, napoleon, s, claim, that, the, russians, did, not, defeat, him, and, he, was, just, the, victim, of, fate, in, 1812, was, very, appealing, to, many, western, historians, russian, historians, tended, to, focus, on, the, french, invasion, of, russia, in, 1812, and, ignore, the, campaigns, in, 1813, 1814, fought, in, germany, and, france, because, a, campaign, fought, on, russian, soil, was, regarded, as, more, important, than, campaigns, abroad, and, because, in, 1812, the, russians, were, commanded, by, the, ethnic, russian, kutuzov, while, in, the, campaigns, in, 1813, 1814, the, senior, russian, commanders, were, mostly, ethnic, germans, being, either, baltic, german, nobility, or, germans, who, had, entered, russian, service, at, the, time, the, conception, held, by, the, russian, elite, was, that, the, russian, empire, was, a, multi, ethnic, entity, in, which, the, baltic, german, aristocrats, in, service, to, the, house, of, romanov, were, considered, part, of, that, elite, an, understanding, of, what, it, meant, to, be, russian, defined, in, terms, of, dynastic, loyalty, rather, than, language, ethnicity, and, culture, that, does, not, appeal, to, those, later, russians, who, wanted, to, see, the, war, as, purely, a, triumph, of, ethnic, russians, one, consequence, of, this, is, that, many, russian, historians, liked, to, disparage, the, officer, corps, of, the, imperial, russian, army, because, of, the, high, proportion, of, baltic, germans, serving, as, officers, which, further, reinforces, the, popular, stereotype, that, the, russians, won, despite, their, officers, rather, than, because, of, them, furthermore, emperor, alexander, i, often, gave, the, impression, at, the, time, that, he, found, russia, a, place, that, was, not, worthy, of, his, ideals, and, he, cared, more, about, europe, as, a, whole, than, about, russia, alexander, s, conception, of, a, war, to, free, europe, from, napoleon, lacked, appeal, to, many, nationalist, minded, russian, historians, who, preferred, to, focus, on, a, campaign, in, defence, of, the, homeland, rather, than, what, lieven, called, alexander, s, rather, murky, mystical, ideas, about, european, brotherhood, and, security, lieven, observed, that, for, every, book, written, in, russia, on, the, campaigns, of, 1813, 1814, there, are, a, hundred, books, on, the, campaign, of, 1812, and, that, the, most, recent, russian, grand, history, of, the, war, of, 1812, 1814, gave, 490, pages, to, the, campaign, of, 1812, and, 50, pages, to, the, campaigns, of, 1813, 1814, lieven, noted, that, tolstoy, ended, war, and, peace, in, december, 1812, and, that, many, russian, historians, have, followed, tolstoy, in, focusing, on, the, campaign, of, 1812, while, ignoring, the, greater, achievements, of, campaigns, of, 1813, 1814, that, ended, with, the, russians, marching, into, paris, napoleon, did, not, touch, serfdom, in, russia, what, the, reaction, of, the, russian, peasantry, would, have, been, if, he, had, lived, up, to, the, traditions, of, the, french, revolution, bringing, liberty, to, the, serfs, is, an, intriguing, question, academics, have, drawn, parallels, between, the, french, invasion, of, russia, and, operation, barbarossa, the, german, invasion, of, 1941, david, stahel, writes, historical, comparisons, reveal, that, many, fundamental, points, that, denote, hitler, s, failure, in, 1941, were, actually, foreshadowed, in, past, campaigns, the, most, obvious, example, is, napoleon, s, ill, fated, invasion, of, russia, in, 1812, the, german, high, command, s, inability, to, grasp, some, of, the, essential, hallmarks, of, this, military, calamity, highlights, another, angle, of, their, flawed, conceptualization, and, planning, in, anticipation, of, operation, barbarossa, like, hitler, napoleon, was, the, conqueror, of, europe, and, foresaw, his, war, on, russia, as, the, key, to, forcing, england, to, make, terms, napoleon, invaded, with, the, intention, of, ending, the, war, in, a, short, campaign, centred, on, a, decisive, battle, in, western, russia, as, the, russians, withdrew, napoleon, s, supply, lines, grew, and, his, strength, was, in, decline, from, week, to, week, the, poor, roads, and, harsh, environment, took, a, deadly, toll, on, both, horses, and, men, while, politically, russia, s, oppressed, serfs, remained, for, the, most, part, loyal, to, the, aristocracy, worse, still, while, napoleon, defeated, the, russian, army, at, smolensk, and, borodino, it, did, not, produce, a, decisive, result, for, the, french, and, each, time, left, napoleon, with, the, dilemma, of, either, retreating, or, pushing, deeper, into, russia, neither, was, really, an, acceptable, option, the, retreat, politically, and, the, advance, militarily, but, in, each, instance, napoleon, opted, for, the, latter, in, doing, so, the, french, emperor, outdid, even, hitler, and, successfully, took, the, russian, capital, in, september, 1812, but, it, counted, for, little, when, the, russians, simply, refused, to, acknowledge, defeat, and, prepared, to, fight, on, through, the, winter, by, the, time, napoleon, left, moscow, to, begin, his, infamous, retreat, the, russian, campaign, was, doomed, the, invasion, by, germany, was, called, the, great, patriotic, war, by, the, soviet, government, to, evoke, comparisons, with, the, victory, by, alexander, i, over, napoleon, s, invading, army, in, addition, the, germans, like, the, french, took, solace, from, the, notion, they, had, been, defeated, by, the, russian, winter, rather, than, the, russians, themselves, or, their, own, mistakes, an, event, of, epic, proportions, and, momentous, importance, for, european, history, the, french, invasion, of, russia, has, been, the, subject, of, much, discussion, among, historians, the, campaign, s, sustained, role, in, russian, popular, culture, may, be, seen, in, leo, tolstoy, s, war, and, peace, pyotr, ilyich, tchaikovsky, s, 1812, overture, and, the, identification, of, it, with, the, german, invasion, during, world, war, ii, which, became, known, as, the, great, patriotic, war, in, the, soviet, union
