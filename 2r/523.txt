philippine, exports, such, as, hemp, sugar, and, tobacco, american, trade, supremacy, did, not, last, long, in, the, face, of, stiff, british, competition, they, gradually, lost, their, control, over, the, philippine, business, market, this, decline, was, due, to, lack, of, support, from, the, u, s, government, and, lack, of, u, s, trade, bases, in, the, orient, in, 1875, russell, sturgis, company, went, into, bankruptcy, followed, by, peele, hubbell, company, in, 1887, soon, after, british, merchants, including, james, adam, smith, lawrence, h, bell, and, robert, p, wood, dominated, the,

that, were, based, on, the, economic, status, of, a, person, background, ancestry, and, economic, status, played, a, huge, role, in, determining, standing, in, the, social, hierarchy, the, spanish, people, as, well, as, native, descendants, of, precolonial, nobility, belonged, to, the, upper, class, and, they, were, further, subdivided, into, more, classes, the, peninsulares, the, creoles, and, the, principal, a, the, peninsulares, were, people, who, were, spanish, born, but, lived, in, the, philippines, the, creoles, or, criollo, people, were, spaniards, who, were, born, in, the, colonies, the, principal, a, was, a, hereditary, class, of, local, indios, who, descended, from, precolonial, datus, rajah, and, nobility, and, were, granted, special, rights, and, privileges, such, as, positions, in, local, government, and, the, right, to, vote, though, they, were, lower, than, the, peninsulares, and, insulares, in, social, standing, many, members, of, the, philippine, revolution, belonged, to, the, principal, a, class, like, jos, rizal, although, the, peninsulares, and, the, creoles, enjoyed, the, same, social, power, as, they, both, belonged, to, the, upper, class, the, peninsulares, considered, themselves, as, socially, superior, to, the, creoles, and, the, native, principal, a, the, lowest, of, the, two, classes, was, the, masses, or, indios, this, class, included, all, poor, commoners, peasants, and, laborers, unlike, the, principal, a, class, where, the, members, enjoyed, high, public, offices, and, recommendations, from, the, king, of, spain, the, masses, only, enjoyed, a, few, civil, rights, and, privileges, the, highest, political, office, that, they, could, possibly, hold, was, the, gobernadorcillo, or, the, town, executive, the, members, of, katipunan, the, secret, organization, that, would, trigger, the, revolution, mainly, consisted, of, the, masses, material, prosperity, at, the, start, of, 19th, century, produced, an, enlightened, middle, class, in, the, philippines, consisting, of, well, to, do, farmers, teachers, lawyers, physicians, writers, and, government, employees, many, of, them, were, able, to, buy, and, read, books, originally, withheld, from, the, lowly, filipino, class, they, discussed, political, problems, and, sought, government, reforms, and, eventually, they, were, able, to, send, their, children, to, colleges, and, universities, in, manila, and, abroad, particularly, to, madrid, the, material, progress, was, primarily, due, to, the, opening, of, the, manila, ports, to, world, trade, the, leading, intellectuals, of, the, country, came, from, the, enlightened, middle, class, they, later, called, themselves, the, ilustrados, which, means, erudite, ones, they, also, considered, themselves, to, be, the, intelligentsia, branch, of, the, filipino, society, from, the, ilustrados, rose, the, prominent, members, of, the, propaganda, movement, who, stirred, the, very, first, flames, of, the, revolution, in, 1868, a, revolution, overthrew, the, autocratic, monarchy, of, queen, isabella, ii, of, spain, which, was, replaced, by, a, civil, and, liberal, government, with, republican,

civilians, and, five, spanish, friars, 362, 363, they, had, the, ability, to, vote, on, reforms, subject, to, ratification, by, the, home, government, 363, however, none, of, the, reforms, were, put, into, effect, due, to, the, friars, fearing, that, the, reforms, would, diminish, their, influence, the, assembly, ceased, to, exist, after, the, 1874, restoration, 363, in, 1776, the, first, major, challenge, to, monarchy, in, centuries, occurred, in, the, american, colonies, although, the, american, revolution, succeeded, it, was, in, a, relatively, isolated, area, in, 1789, however, the,

than, a, spanish, subject, with, the, increasing, economic, and, political, stability, in, the, philippines, the, middle, class, began, demanding, that, the, churches, in, the, philippines, be, nationalized, through, a, process, known, as, secularization, in, this, process, control, of, philippine, parishes, were, to, be, passed, from, the, religious, orders, to, the, secular, priests,

cortes, where, they, could, express, their, grievances, this, together, with, the, secularization, issues, gave, rise, to, the, criollo, insurgencies, in, the, late, 18th, century, criollo, or, insulares, islanders, as, they, were, locally, called, writers, began, spreading, the, ideals, of, the, french, revolution, in, the, philippines, at, the, same, time, a, royal, decree, ordered, the,

were, between, 30, 000, and, 400, 000, members, by, 1896, other, historians, argue, that, there, were, only, a, few, hundred, to, a, few, thousand, members, the, existence, of, the, katipunan, eventually, became, known, to, the, colonial, authorities, through, teodoro, pati, o, who, revealed, it, to, the, spaniard, la, font, general, manager, of, the, printing, shop, diario, de, manila, 29,

accompanied, by, patriotic, cries, the, exact, date, and, location, are, disputed, but, two, possibilities, have, been, officially, endorsed, by, the, philippine, government, initially, august, 26, in, balintawak, and, later, august, 23, in, pugad, lawin, thus, the, event, is, called, the, cry, of, pugad, lawin, or, cry, of, balintawak, however, the, issue, is, further, complicated, by, other, possible, dates, such, as, august, 24, and, 25, and, other, locations, such, as, kangkong, bahay, toro, and, pasong, tamo, furthermore, at, the, time, balintawak, referred, not, only, to, a, specific,

planned, for, august, 29, bonifacio, appointed, generals, to, lead, rebel, forces, in, manila, before, hostilities, erupted, bonifacio, also, reorganized, the, katipunan, into, an, open, revolutionary, government, with, himself, as, president, and, the, supreme, council, of, the, katipunan, as, his, cabinet, on, the, morning, of, august, 25, the, rebels, came, under, attack, by, a, spanish, civil, guard, unit, with, the, rebels, having, greater, numbers, but, the, spanish, being, better, armed, the, forces, disengaged, after, a, brief, skirmish, and, some, casualties, on, both, sides, another, skirmish, took, place, on, august, 26, which, sent, the, rebels, retreating, toward, balara, at, noon, bonifacio, and, some, of, his, men, briefly, rested, in, diliman, in, the, afternoon, civil, guards, sent, to, caloocan, to, investigate, attacks, on, chinese, merchants, done, by, bandits, who, had, attached, themselves, to, the, rebels, came, across, a, group, of, katipuneros, and, briefly, engaged, them, 367, the, commander, of, the, guards, lieutenant, ros, reported, the, encounter, to, the, authorities, and, the, report, drove, governor, general, ram, n,

bonifacio, issued, the, following, general, proclamation, this, manifesto, is, for, all, of, you, it, is, absolutely, necessary, for, us, to, stop, at, the, earliest, possible, time, the, nameless, oppositions, being, perpetrated, on, the, sons, of, the, country, who, are, now, suffering, the, brutal, punishment, and, tortures, in, jails, and, because, of, this, please, let, all, the, brethren, know, that, on, saturday, the, 29th, of, the, current, month, the, revolution, shall, commence, according, to, our, agreement, for, this, purpose, it, is, necessary, for, all, towns, to, rise, simultaneously, and, attack, manila, at, the, same, time, anybody, who, obstructs, this, sacred, ideal, of, the, people, will, be, considered, a, traitor, and, an, enemy, except, if, he, is, ill, or, is, not, physically, fit, in, which, case, he, shall, be, tried, according, to, the, regulations, we, have, put, in, force, mount, of, liberty, 28, august, 1896, andr, s, bonifacio, the, conventional, view, among, filipino, historians, is, that, bonifacio, did, not, carry, out, the, planned, katipunan, attack, on, manila, the, following, day, and, instead, attacked, a, powder, magazine, at, san, juan, del, monte, however, more, recent, studies, have, advanced, the, view, that, the, planned, attack, did, occur, according, to, this, view, bonifacio, s, battle, at, san, juan, del, monte, now, called, the, battle, of, pinaglabanan, was, only, a, part, of, a, bigger, battle, for, manila, hitherto, unrecognized, as, such, hostilities, in, the, area, started, on, the, evening, of, august, 29, when, hundreds, of, rebels, attacked, the, civil, guard, garrison, in, pasig, just, as, hundreds, of, other, rebels, personally, led, by, bonifacio, were, amassing, in, san, juan, del, monte, which, they, attacked, at, about, 4, a, m, on, the, 30th, 368, bonifacio, planned, to, capture, the, san, juan, del, monte, powder, magazine, 368, along, with, a, water, station, which, supplied, manila, the, spaniards, outnumbered, fought, a, delaying, battle, until, reinforcements, arrived, once, reinforced, the, spaniards, drove, bonifacio, s, forces, back, with, heavy, casualties, elsewhere, rebels, attacked, mandaluyong, sampaloc, sta, ana, pandacan, pateros, marikina, and, caloocan, as, well, as, makati, and, taguig, balintawak, in, caloocan, saw, intense, fighting, rebel, troops, tended, to, gravitate, towards, fighting, in, san, juan, del, monte, and, sampaloc, south, of, manila, a, thousand, strong, rebel, force, attacked, a, small, force, of, civil, guards, in, pandacan, katipuneros, attacked, the, parish, church, making, the, parish, priest, run, for, his, life, after, their, defeat, in, battle, of, san, juan, del, monte, bonifacio, s, troops, regrouped, near, marikina, san, mateo, and, montalban, where, they, proceeded, to, attack, these, areas, they, captured, the, areas, but, were, driven, back, by, spanish, counterattacks, and, bonifacio, eventually, ordered, a, retreat, to, balara, on, the, way, bonifacio, was, nearly, killed, shielding, emilio, jacinto, from, a, spanish, bullet, that, grazed, his, collar, despite, his, retreat, bonifacio, was, not, completely, defeated, and, was, still, considered, to, be, a, threat, south, of, manila, the, towns, of, san, francisco, de, malabon, noveleta, and, kawit, in, cavite, rebelled, a, few, days, after, in, nueva, ecija, north, of, manila, rebels, in, san, isidro, led, by, mariano, llanera, attacked, the, spanish, garrison, on, september, 2, 4, but, they, were, repulsed, by, august, 30, the, revolt, had, spread, to, eight, provinces, on, that, date, governor, general, ram, n, blanco, declared, a, state, of, war, in, these, provinces, and, placed, them, under, martial, law, 368, these, provinces, were, manila, bulacan, cavite, pampanga, tarlac, laguna, batangas, and, nueva, ecija, they, would, later, be, represented, as, the, eight, rays, of, the, sun, in, the, filipino, flag, additionally, due, to, the, scant, military, resources, spain, had, in, the, philippines, the, governor, called, for, the, participation, of, civilians, in, the, defence, of, spanish, sovereingty, and, established, the, loyal, volunteers, battalion, in, manila, following, the, example, of, similar, units, created, in, cuba, and, puerto, rico, between, the, 1850s, and, the, 1860s, more, similar, units, were, created, in, manila, and, other, areas, under, spanish, control, the, rebels, had, few, firearms, they, were, mostly, armed, with, bolo, knives, and, bamboo, spears, the, lack, of, guns, has, been, proposed, as, a, possible, reason, why, the, manila, attack, allegedly, never, succeeded, also, the, katipunan, leaders, from, cavite, had, earlier, expressed, reservations, about, starting, an, uprising, due, to, their, lack, of, firearms, and, preparation, as, a, result, they, did, not, send, troops, to, manila, but, instead, attacked, garrisons, in, their, own, locales, some, historians, have, argued, that, the, katipunan, defeat, in, the, manila, area, was, partly, the, fault, of, the, cavite, rebels, due, to, their, absence, as, their, presence, would, have, proved, crucial, in, their, memoirs, cavite, rebel, leaders, justified, their, absence, in, manila, by, claiming, bonifacio, failed, to, execute, pre, arranged, signals, to, begin, the, uprising, such, as, setting, balloons, loose, and, extinguishing, the, lights, at, the, luneta, park, however, these, claims, have, been, dismissed, as, historical, mythology, as, reasoned, by, historians, if, they, were, really, waiting, for, signals, before, marching, on, manila, they, would, have, arrived, too, late, for, the, fray, bonifacio, s, command, for, a, simultaneous, attack, is, interpreted, as, evidence, that, such, signals, were, never, arranged, other, factors, for, the, katipunan, defeat, include, the, capture, of, bonifacio, s, battle, plans, by, spanish, intelligence, the, spanish, concentrated, their, forces, in, the, manila, area, while, pulling, out, troops, in, other, provinces, which, proved, beneficial, for, rebels, in, other, areas, particularly, cavite, the, authorities, also, transferred, a, regiment, of, 500, native, troops, to, marawi, mindanao, where, the, soldiers, later, rebelled, when, the, revolution, broke, out, rizal, was, in, cavite, awaiting, the, monthly, mailboat, to, spain, he, had, volunteered, and, been, accepted, for, medical, service, in, the, spanish, army, fighting, in, cuba, the, mailboat, left, on, september, 3, and, arrived, in, barcelona, which, was, under, martial, law, on, october, 3, 1896, after, a, brief, confinement, at, montjuich, prison, rizal, was, told, by, captain, general, eulogio, despujol, that, he, would, not, be, going, on, to, cuba, but, would, be, sent, back, to, the, philippines, instead, upon, his, return, he, was, imprisoned, in, fort, santiago, while, incarcerated, rizal, petitioned, governor, general, ram, n, blanco, for, permission, to, make, a, statement, on, the, rebellion, his, petition, was, granted, and, rizal, wrote, the, manifesto, algunos, filipinos, wherein, he, decried, the, use, of, his, name, as, a, war, cry, among, certain, people, who, were, up, in, arms, stated, that, for, reforms, to, bear, fruit, they, must, come, from, above, since, those, that, come, from, below, will, be, irregular, and, uncertain, shocks, and, affirmed, that, he, condemn, this, absurd, savage, insurrection, however, the, text, was, suppressed, on, the, recommendation, of, the, judge, advocate, general, by, december, there, were, three, major, centers, of, rebellion, cavite, under, emilio, aguinaldo, bulacan, under, mariano, llanera, and, morong, now, part, of, rizal, under, bonifacio, bonifacio, served, as, tactician, for, the, rebel, guerillas, though, his, prestige, suffered, when, he, lost, battles, that, he, personally, led, meanwhile, in, cavite, katipuneros, under, mariano, lvarez, bonifacio, s, uncle, by, marriage, and, baldomero, aguinaldo, of, cavite, el, viejo, modern, kawit, won, early, victories, the, magdalo, council, commissioned, edilberto, evangelista, an, engineer, to, plan, the, defense, and, logistics, of, the, revolution, in, cavite, his, first, victory, was, in, the, battle, of, imus, on, september, 1, 1896, defeating, the, spanish, forces, under, general, ernesto, aguirre, with, the, aid, of, jose, tagle, the, cavite, revolutionaries, particularly, emilio, aguinaldo, won, prestige, through, defeating, spanish, troops, in, set, piece, battles, while, other, rebels, like, bonifacio, and, llanera, were, engaged, in, guerrilla, warfare, aguinaldo, speaking, for, the, magdalo, ruling, council, issued, a, manifesto, proclaiming, a, provisional, and, revolutionary, government, after, his, early, successes, despite, the, existence, of, bonifacio, s, katipunan, government, the, katipunan, in, cavite, was, divided, into, two, councils, the, magdiwang, led, by, alvarez, and, the, magdalo, led, by, baldomero, aguinaldo, emilio, s, cousin, at, first, these, two, katipunan, councils, cooperated, with, each, other, in, the, battlefield, as, in, the, battles, of, binakayan, and, dalahican, where, they, won, their, first, major, victory, over, the, spaniards, however, rivalries, between, command, and, territory, soon, developed, and, they, refused, to, cooperate, with, each, other, in, battle, to, unite, the, katipunan, in, cavite, the, magdiwang, through, artemio, ricarte, and, p, o, del, pilar, called, bonifacio, who, was, fighting, in, morong, present, day, rizal, province, to, mediate, between, the, factions, perhaps, due, to, his, kinship, ties, with, their, leader, bonifacio, was, seen, as, partial, to, the, magdiwang, it, was, not, long, before, the, issue, of, leadership, was, debated, the, magdiwang, faction, recognized, bonifacio, as, supreme, leader, being, the, head, of, the, katipunan, the, magdalo, faction, agitated, for, emilio, aguinaldo, to, be, the, movement, s, head, because, of, his, successes, in, the, battlefield, compared, to, bonifacio, s, record, of, personal, defeats, meanwhile, the, spanish, troops, now, under, the, command, of, the, new, governor, general, camilo, de, polavieja, steadily, gained, ground, on, december, 31, an, assembly, was, convened, in, imus, to, settle, the, leadership, dispute, the, magdalo, insisted, on, the, establishment, of, revolutionary, government, to, replace, the, katipunan, the, magdiwang, favored, retention, of, the, katipunan, arguing, that,

philippines, under, the, protection, of, the, united, states, navy, in, an, april, 28, message, from, pratt, to, u, s, secretary, of, state, william, r, day, there, was, no, mention, of, independence,

maximo, kalaw, wrote, in, 1927, a, few, of, the, principal, facts, however, seem, quite, clear, aguinaldo, was, not, made, to, understand, that, in, consideration, of, filipino, cooperation, the, united, states, would, extend, its, sovereignty, over, the, islands, and, thus, in, place, of, the, old, spanish, master, a, new, one, would, step, in, the, truth, was, that, nobody, at, the, time, ever, thought, that, the, end, of, the, war, would, result, in, the, retention, of, the, philippines, by, the, united, states, on, july, 15, aguinaldo, issued, three, organic, decrees, assuming,

the, filipino, forces, would, not, be, allowed, to, enter, the, city, this, plan, minimized, the, risk, of, unnecessary, casualties, on, all, sides, while, the, spanish, would, also, avoid, the,
