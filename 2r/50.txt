discernible, chronology, of, the, immigration, process, as, it, took, place, in, many, individual, efforts, and, stages, often, even, encouraged, by, the, slavic, regional, lords, however, the, new, communities, were, subjected, to, german, law, and, customs, total, numbers, of, settlers, were, generally, rather, low, and, depending, on, who, held, a, numerical, majority, populations, usually, assimilated, into, each, other, in, many, regions, only, enclaves, would, persist, like, hermannstadt, founded, by, the, transylvanian, saxons, in, the, medieval, hungarian, kingdom, today, in,

adalbert, began, to, assert, the, powers, of, the, church, against, secular, authorities, that, is, the, emperor, this, precipitated, the, crisis, of, 1111, as, yet, another, chapter, of, the, long,

pledged, allegiance, to, the, swabian, house, of, hohenstaufen, during, this, early, period, the, welfs, generally, maintained, ecclesiastical, independence, under, the, papacy, and, political, particularism, the, focus, on, ducal, interests, against, the, central, imperial, authority, the, waiblings, on, the, other, hand, championed, strict, control, of, the, church, and, a, strong, central, imperial, government, during, the, reign, of, the, hohenstaufen, emperor, frederick, i, barbarossa, an, accommodation, was, reached, in, 1156, between, the, two, factions, the, duchy, of, bavaria, was, returned, to, henry, the, proud, s, son, henry, the, lion, duke, of, saxony, who, represented, the, guelph, party, however, the, margraviate, of, austria, was, separated, from, bavaria, and, turned, into, the, independent, duchy, of, austria, by, virtue, of, the, privilegium, minus, in, 1156, having, become, wealthy, through, trade, the, confident, cities, of, northern, italy,

in, the, battle, of, legnano, in, 1176, the, following, year, a, reconciliation, was, reached, between, the, emperor, and, pope, alexander, iii, in, the, treaty, of, venice, the, 1183, peace, of, constance, eventually, settled, that, the, italian, cities, remained, loyal, to, the, empire, but, were, granted, local, jurisdiction, and, full, regal, rights, in, their, territories, in, 1180, henry, the, lion, was, outlawed, saxony, was, divided, and, bavaria, was, given, to, otto, of, wittelsbach, who, founded, the, wittelsbach, dynasty, which, was, to, rule, bavaria, until, 1918, from, 1184, to, 1186, the, empire, under, frederick, i, barbarossa, reached, its, cultural, peak, with, the, diet, of, pentecost, held, at, mainz, and, the, marriage, of, his, son, henry, in, milan, to,

and, the, papacy, led, to, the, 1338, declaration, at, rhense, by, six, princes, of, the, imperial, estate, to, the, effect, that, election, by, all, or, the, majority, of, the, electors, automatically, conferred, the, royal, title, and, rule, over, the, empire, without, papal, confirmation, as, result, the, monarch, was, no, longer, subject, to, papal, approbation, and, became,

that, a, stable, peaceful, entity, in, central, europe, could, discourage, aggressive, moves, by, france, or, russia, most, historians, however, concluded, that, the, confederation, was, weak, and, ineffective, and, an, obstacle, to, german, nationalism, the, union, was, undermined, by, the, creation, of, the, zollverein, in, 1834, the, 1848, revolutions, the, rivalry, between, prussia, and, austria, and, was, finally, dissolved, in, the, wake, of, the, austro, prussian, war, of, 1866, to, be, replaced, by, the, north, german, confederation, during, the, same, year, increasingly, after,

introduction, of, a, new, more, efficient, commercial, law, the, idea, that, these, reforms, were, beneficial, for, industrialization, has, been, contested, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, industrial, revolution, was, in, full, swing, in, britain, france, and, belgium, the, various, small, federal, states, in, germany, developed, only, slowly, and, independently, as, competition, was, strong, early, investments, for, the, railway, network, during, the, 1830s, came, almost, exclusively, from, private, hands, without, a, central, regulatory, agency, the, construction, projects, were, quickly, realized, actual, industrialization, only, took, off, after, 1850, in, the, wake, of, the, railroad, construction, the, textile, industry, grew, rapidly, profiting, from, the, elimination, of, tariff, barriers, by, the, zollverein, during, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, the, german, industry, grew, exponentially, and, by, 1900, germany, was, an, industrial, world, leader, along, with, britain, and, the, united, states, ref, in, 1800, the, population, was, predominantly, rural, as, only, 10, lived, in, communities, of, 5, 000, or, more, people, and, only, 2, lived, in,

development, came, with, the, railroad, revolution, in, the, 1840s, which, opened, up, new, markets, for, local, products, created, a, pool, of, middle, managers, increased, the, demand, for, engineers, architects, and, skilled, machinists, and, stimulated, investments, in, coal, and, iron, political, disunity, of, three, dozen, states, and, a, pervasive, conservatism, made, it, difficult, to, build, railways, in, the, 1830s, however, by, the, 1840s, trunk, lines, did, link, the, major, cities, each, german, state, was, responsible, for, the, lines, within, its, own, borders, economist,

the, demands, of, railroad, construction, and, the, railways, were, a, major, impetus, for, the, growth, of, the, new, steel, industry, observers, found, that, even, as, late, as, 1890, their, engineering, was, inferior, to, britain, however, german, unification, in, 1870, stimulated, consolidation, nationalisation, into, state, owned, companies, and, further, rapid, growth, unlike, the, situation, in, france, the, goal, was, the, support, of, industrialisation, eventually, numerous, lines, criss, crossed, the, ruhr, area, and, other, industrial, centers, and, provided, good,

germany, across, the, land, there, was, a, movement, to, unite, the, larger, lutheran, and, the, smaller, reformed, protestant, churches, the, churches, themselves, brought, this, about, in, baden, nassau, and, bavaria, however, in, prussia, king, frederick, william, iii, was, determined, to, handle, unification, entirely, on, his, own, terms, without, consultation, his, goal, was, to, unify, the, protestant, churches, and, to, impose, a, single, standardized, liturgy, organization, and, even, architecture, the, long, term, goal, was, to, have, fully, centralized, royal, control, of, all, the, protestant, churches, in, a, series, of, proclamations, over, several, decades, the, church, of, the, prussian, union, was, formed, bringing, together, the, more, numerous, lutherans, and, the, less, numerous, reformed, protestants, the, government, of, prussia, now, had, full, control, over, church, affairs, with, the, king, himself, recognized, as, the, leading, bishop, opposition, to, unification, came, from, the, old, lutherans, in, silesia, who, clung, tightly, to, the, theological, and, liturgical, forms, they, had, followed, since, the, days, of, luther, the, government, attempted, to, crack, down, on, them, so, they, went, underground, tens, of, thousands, migrated, to, south, australia, and, especially, to, the, united, states, where, they, formed, the, missouri, synod, which, is, still, in, operation, as, a, conservative, denomination, finally, in, 1845, a, new, king, frederick, william, iv, offered, a, general, amnesty, and, allowed, the, old, lutherans, to, form, a, separate, church, association, with, only, nominal, government, control, from, the, religious, point, of, view, of, the, typical, catholic, or, protestant, major, changes, were, underway, in, terms, of, a, much, more, personalized, religiosity, that, focused, on, the, individual, more, than, the, church, or, the, ceremony, the, rationalism, of, the, late, 19th, century, faded, away, and, there, was, a, new, emphasis, on, the, psychology, and, feeling, of, the, individual, especially, in, terms, of, contemplating, sinfulness, redemption, and, the, mysteries, and, the, revelations, of, christianity, pietistic, revivals, were, common, among, protestants, among, catholics, there, was, a, sharp, increase, in, popular, pilgrimages, in, 1844, alone, half, a, million, pilgrims, made, a,

in, germany, had, historically, been, largely, independent, of, rome, but, now, the, vatican, exerted, increasing, control, a, new, ultramontanism, of, catholics, highly, loyal, to, rome, a, sharp, controversy, broke, out, in, 1837, 1838, in, the, largely, catholic, rhineland, over, the, religious, education, of, children, of, mixed, marriages, where, the, mother, was, catholic, and, the, father, protestant, the, government, passed, laws, to, require, that, these, children, always, be, raised, as, protestants, contrary, to, napoleonic, law, that, had, previously, prevailed, and, allowed, the, parents, to, make, the, decision, it, put, the, catholic, archbishop, under, house, arrest, in, 1840, the, new, king, frederick, william, iv, sought, reconciliation, and, ended, the, controversy, by, agreeing, to, most, of, the, catholic, demands, however, catholic, memories, remained, deep, and, led, to, a, sense, that, catholics, always, needed, to, stick, together, in, the,

liberal, student, organisations, in, one, of, the, few, major, actions, of, the, german, confederation, prince, metternich, called, a, conference, that, issued, the, repressive, carlsbad, decrees, designed, to, suppress, liberal, agitation, against, the, conservative, governments, of, the, german, states, the, decrees, terminated, the, fast, fading, nationalist, fraternities, german, burschenschaften, removed, liberal, university, professors, and, expanded, the, censorship, of, the, press, the, decrees, began, the, persecution, of, the, demagogues, which, was, directed, against,

industrialisation, developed, the, need, for, a, unified, german, state, with, a, uniform, currency, legal, system, and, government, became, more, and, more, obvious, growing, discontent, with, the, political, and, social, order, imposed, by, the, congress, of, vienna, led, to, the, outbreak, in, 1848, of, the, march, revolution, in, the, german, states, in, may, the, german, national, assembly, the, frankfurt, parliament, met, in, frankfurt, to, draw, up, a, national, german, constitution, but, the, 1848, revolution, turned, out, to, be, unsuccessful, king, frederick, william, iv, of,

established, by, 1850, many, leaders, went, into, exile, including, a, number, who, went, to, the, united, states, and, became, a, political, force, there, the, 1850s, were, a, period, of, extreme, political, reaction, dissent, was, vigorously, suppressed, and, many, germans, emigrated, to, america, following, the, collapse, of, the, 1848, uprisings, frederick, william, iv, became, extremely, depressed, and, melancholic, during, this, period, and, was, surrounded, by, men, who, advocated, clericalism, and, absolute, divine, monarchy, the, prussian, people, once, again, lost, interest, in, politics, prussia, not, only, expanded, its, territory, but, began, to, industrialize, rapidly, while, maintaining, a, strong, agricultural, base, in, 1857, the, prussian, king, frederick, william, iv, suffered, a, stroke, and, his, brother, william, served, as, regent, until, 1861, when, he, became, king, william, i, although, conservative, william, was, very, pragmatic, his, most, significant, accomplishment, was, the, naming, of, otto, von, bismarck, as, prussian, minister, president, in, 1862, the, cooperation, of, bismarck, defense, minister, albrecht, von, roon, and, field, marshal, helmut, von, moltke, set, the, stage, for, the, military, victories, over, denmark, austria, and, france, that, led, to, the, unification, of, germany, in, 1863, 1864, disputes, between, prussia, and, denmark, over, schleswig, escalated, which, was, not, part, of, the, german, confederation, and, which, danish, nationalists, wanted, to, incorporate, into, the, danish, kingdom, the, conflict, led, to, the, second, war, of, schleswig, in, 1864, prussia, joined, by, austria, easily, defeated, denmark, and, occupied, jutland, the, danes, were, forced, to, cede, both, the, duchy, of, schleswig, and, the, duchy, of, holstein, to, austria, and, prussia, the, subsequent, management, of, the, two, duchies, led, to, tensions, between, austria, and, prussia, austria, wanted, the, duchies, to, become, an, independent, entity, within, the, german, confederation, while, prussia, intended, to, annex, them, the, disagreement, served, as, a, pretext, for, the, seven, weeks, war, between, austria, and, prussia, that, broke, out, in, june, 1866, in, july, the, two, armies, clashed, at, sadowa, k, niggr, tz, bohemia, in, an, enormous, battle, involving, half, a, million, men, prussian, superior, logistics, and, the, modern, breech, loading, needle, guns, superiority, over, the, slow, muzzle, loading, rifles, of, the, austrians, proved, to, be, elementary, for, prussia, s, victory, the, battle, had, also, decided, the, struggle, for, hegemony, in, germany, and, bismarck, was, deliberately, lenient, with, defeated, austria, that, was, to, play, only, a, subordinate, role, in,

leadership, of, prussia, austria, was, excluded, and, its, immense, influence, over, germany, finally, came, to, an, end, the, north, german, federation, was, a, transitional, organisation, that, existed, from, 1867, to, 1871, between, the, dissolution, of, the, german, confederation, and, the, founding, of, the, german, empire, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, determined, the, political, course, of, the, german, empire, until, 1890, he, fostered, alliances, in, europe, to, contain, france, on, the, one, hand, and, aspired, to, consolidate, germany, s, influence, in, europe, on, the, other, his, principal, domestic, policies, focused, on, the, suppression, of, socialism, and, the, reduction, of, the, strong, influence, of, the, roman, catholic, church, on, its, adherents, he, issued, a, series, of, anti, socialist, laws, in, accord, with, a, set, of, social, laws, that, included, universal, health, care, pension, plans, and, other, social, security, programs, his, kulturkampf, policies, were, vehemently, resisted, by, catholics, who, organized, political, opposition, in, the, center, party, zentrum, german, industrial, and, economic, power, had, grown, to, match, britain, by, 1900, in, 1888, the, young, and, ambitious, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, became, emperor, he, rejected, advice, from, experienced, politicians, and, ordered, bismarck, s, resignation, in, 1890, he, opposed, bismarck, s, careful, and, delicate, foreign, policy, and, was, determined, to, pursue, colonialist, policies, as, britain, and, france, had, been, doing, for, centuries, the, kaiser, promoted, the, active, colonization, of, africa, and, asia, for, the, lands, that, were, not, already, colonies, of, other, european, powers, the, kaiser, took, a, mostly, unilateral, approach, in, europe, only, allied, with, the, austro, hungarian, empire, and, embarked, on, a, dangerous, naval, arms, race, with, britain, his, aggressive, and, erroneous, policies, greatly, contributed, to, the, situation, in, which, the, assassination, of, the, austrian, hungarian, crown, prince, would, spark, off, world, war, i, bismarck, was, the, dominant, personality, not, just, in, germany, but, in, all, of, europe, and, indeed, the, entire, diplomatic, world, 1870, 1890, historians, continue, to, debate, his, goals, lothar, gall, and, ernst, engelberg, consider, bismarck, was, a, future, oriented, modernizer, in, sharp, contrast, jonathan, steinberg, decided, he, was, basically, a, traditional, prussian, whose, highest, priorities, were, to, reinforce, the, monarchy, the, army, and, the, social, and, economic, dominance, of, his, own, junker, class, thereby, being, responsible, for, a, tragic, history, after, his, removal, in, 1890, in, 1868, the, spanish, queen,

union, of, 25, states, that, varied, considerably, in, size, demography, constitution, economy, culture, religion, and, socio, political, development, however, even, prussia, itself, which, accounted, for, two, thirds, of, the, territory, as, well, as, of, the, population, had, emerged, from, the, empire, s, periphery, as, a, newcomer, it, also, faced, colossal, cultural, and, economic, internal, divisions, the, prussian, provinces, of, westphalia, and, the, rhineland, for, example, had, been, under, french, control, during, the, previous, decades, the, local, people, who, had, benefited,

disjointed, junker, estates, of, pommerania, the, inhabitants, of, the, smaller, territorial, lands, especially, in, central, and, southern, germany, greatly, rejected, the, prussianized, concept, of,

clearly, demonstrated, historians, increasingly, argue, that, the, nation, state, was, forged, through, empire, national, identity, was, expressed, in, bombastic, imperial, stone, iconography, and, was, to, be, achieved, as, an, imperial, people, with, an, emperor, as, head, of, state, and, it, was, to, develop, imperial, ambitions, domestic, european, and, global, bismarck, s, domestic, policies, as, chancellor, of, germany, were, based, on, his, effort, to, universally, adopt, the, idea, of, the, protestant, prussian, state, and, achieve, the, clear, separation, of, church, and, state, in, all, imperial, principalities, in, the, kulturkampf, lit, culture, struggle, from, 1871, to, 1878, he, tried, to, minimize, the, influence, of, the, roman, catholic, church, and, its, political, arm, the, catholic, centre, party, via, secularization, of, all, education, and, introduction, of, civil, marriage, but, without, success, the, kulturkampf, antagonised, many, protestants, as, well, as, catholics, and, was, eventually, abandoned, the, millions, of, non, german, imperial, subjects, like, the, polish, danish, and, french, minorities, were, left, with, no, choice, but, to, endure, discrimination, or, accept, the, policies, of, germanisation, the, new, empire, provided, attractive, top, level, career, opportunities, for, the, national, nobility, in, the, various, branches, of, the, consular, and, civil, services, and, the, army, as, a, consequence, the, aristocratic, near, total, control, of, the, civil, sector, guaranteed, a, dominant, voice, in, the,

a, mere, 11, commoners, these, commoners, were, indiscriminately, recruited, from, elite, industrialist, and, banking, families, the, consular, corps, employed, numerous, commoners, that, however, occupied, positions, of, little, to, no, executive, power, the, prussian, tradition, to, reserve, the, highest, military, ranks, for, young, aristocrats, was, adopted, and, the, new, constitution, put, all, military, affairs, under, the, direct, control, of, the, emperor, and, beyond, control, of, the, reichstag, with, its, large, corps, of, reserve, officers, across, germany, the, military, strengthened, its, role, as, the, estate, which, upheld, the, nation, and, historian, hans, ulrich, wehler, added, it, became, an, almost, separate, self, perpetuating, caste, power, increasingly, was, centralized, among, the, 7000, aristocrats, who, resided, in, the, national, capital, of, berlin, and, neighboring, potsdam, berlin, s, rapidly, increasing, rich, middle, class, copied, the, aristocracy, and, tried, to, marry, into, it, a, peerage, could, permanently, boost, a, rich, industrial, family, into, the, upper, reaches, of, the, establishment, however, the, process, tended, to, work, in, the, other, direction, as, the, nobility, became, industrialists, for, example, 221, of, the, 243, mines, in, silesia, were, owned, by, nobles, or, by, the, king, of, prussia, himself, the, middle, class, in, the, cities, grew, exponentially, although, it, never, acquired, the, powerful, parliamentary, representation, and, legislative, rights, as, in, france, britain, or, the, united, states, the, association, of, german, women, s, organizations, or, bdf, was, established, in, 1894, to, encompass, the, proliferating, women, s, organizations, that, had, emerged, since, the, 1860s, from, the, beginning, the, bdf, was, a, bourgeois, organization, its, members, working, toward, equality, with, men, in, such, areas, as, education, financial, opportunities, and, political, life, working, class, women, were, not, welcome, and, were, organized, by, the, socialists, the, rise, of, the, socialist, workers, party, later, known, as, the, social, democratic, party, of, germany, spd, aimed, to, peacefully, establish, a, socialist, order, through, the, transformation, of, the, existing, political, and, social, conditions, from, 1878, bismarck, tried, to, oppose, the, growing, social, democratic, movement, by, outlawing, the, party, s, organisation, its, assemblies, and, most, of, its, newspapers, nonetheless, the, social, democrats, grew, stronger, and, bismarck, initiated, his, social, welfare, program, in, 1883, in, order, to, appease, the, working, class, bismarck, built, on, a, tradition, of, welfare, programs, in, prussia, and, saxony, that, began, as, early, as, the, 1840s, in, the, 1880s, he, introduced, old, age, pensions, accident, insurance, medical, care, and, unemployment, insurance, that, formed, the, basis, of, the, modern, european, welfare, state, his, paternalistic, programs, won, the, support, of, german, industry, because, its, goals, were, to, win, the, support, of, the, working, classes, for, the, empire, and, reduce, the, outflow, of, immigrants, to, america, where, wages, were, higher, but, welfare, did, not, exist, bismarck, further, won, the, support, of, both, industry, and, skilled, workers, by, his, high, tariff, policies, which, protected, profits, and, wages, from, american, competition, although, they, alienated, the, liberal, intellectuals, who, wanted, free, trade, bismarck, would, not, tolerate, any, power, outside, germany, as, in, rome, having, a, say, in, domestic, affairs, he, launched, the, kulturkampf, culture, war, against, the, power, of, the, pope, and, the, catholic, church, in, 1873, but, only, in, the, state, of, prussia, this, gained, strong, support, from, german, liberals, who, saw, the, catholic, church, as, the, bastion, of, reaction, and, their, greatest, enemy, the, catholic, element, in, turn, saw, in, the, national, liberals, the, worst, enemy, and, formed, the, center, party, catholics, although, nearly, a, third, of, the, national, population, were, seldom, allowed, to, hold, major, positions, in, the, imperial, government, or, the, prussian, government, after, 1871, there, was, a, systematic, purge, of, the, remaining, catholics, in, the, powerful, interior, ministry, which, handled, all, police, affairs, the, only, catholic, was, a, messenger, boy, jews, were, likewise, heavily, discriminated, against, most, of, the, kulturkampf, was, fought, out, in, prussia, but, imperial, germany, passed, the, pulpit, law, which, made, it, a, crime, for, any, cleric, to, discuss, public, issues, in, a, way, that, displeased, the, government, nearly, all, catholic, bishops, clergy, and, laymen, rejected, the, legality, of, the, new, laws, and, defiantly, faced, the, increasingly, heavy, penalties, and, imprisonments, imposed, by, bismarck, s, government, historian, anthony, steinhoff, reports, the, casualty, totals, as, of, 1878, only, three, of, eight, prussian, dioceses, still, had, bishops, some, 1, 125, of, 4, 600, parishes, were, vacant, and, nearly, 1, 800, priests, ended, up, in, jail, or, in, exile, finally, between, 1872, and, 1878, numerous, catholic, newspapers, were, confiscated, catholic, associations, and, assemblies, were, dissolved, and, catholic, civil, servants, were, dismissed, merely, on, the, pretence, of, having, ultramontane, sympathies, bismarck, underestimated, the, resolve, of, the, catholic, church, and, did, not, foresee, the, extremes, that, this, struggle, would, attain, the, catholic, church, denounced, the, harsh, new, laws, as, anti, catholic, and, mustered, the, support, of, its, rank, and, file, voters, across, germany, in, the, following, elections, the, center, party, won, a, quarter, of, the, seats, in, the, imperial, diet, the, conflict, ended, after, 1879, because, pope, pius, ix, died, in, 1878, and, bismarck, broke, with, the, liberals, to, put, his, main, emphasis, on, tariffs, foreign, policy, and, attacking, socialists, bismarck, negotiated, with, the, conciliatory, new, pope, leo, xiii, peace, was, restored, the, bishops, returned, and, the, jailed, clerics, were, released, laws, were, toned, down, or, taken, back, but, the, laws, concerning, education, civil, registry, of, marriages, and, religious, disaffiliation, remained, in, place, the, center, party, gained, strength, and, became, an, ally, of, bismarck, especially, when, he, attacked, socialism, historians, have, cited, the, campaign, against, the, catholic, church, as, well, as, a, similar, campaign, against, the, social, democratic, party, as, leaving, a, lasting, influence, on, the, german, consciousness, whereby, national, unity, can, be, encouraged, by, excluding, or, persecuting, a, minority, this, strategy, later, referred, to, as, negative, integration, set, a, tone, of, either, being, loyal, to, the, government, or, an, enemy, of, the, state, which, directly, influenced, german, nationalist, sentiment, and, the, later, nazi, movement, chancellor, bismarck, s, imperial, foreign, policy, basically, aimed, at, security, and, the, prevention, of, a, franco, russian, alliance, in, order, to, avoid, a, likely, two, front, war, the, league, of, three, emperors, was, signed, in, 1873, by, russia, austria, and, germany, it, stated, that, republicanism, and, socialism, were, common, enemies, and, that, the, three, powers, would, discuss, any, matters, concerning, foreign, policy, bismarck, needed, good, relations, with, russia, in, order, to, keep, france, isolated, russia, fought, a, victorious, war, against, the, ottoman, empire, from, 1877, to, 1878, and, attempted, to, establish, the, principality, of, bulgaria, that, was, strongly, opposed, by, france, and, britain, in, particular, as, they, were, long, concerned, with, the, preservation, of, the, ottoman, empire, and, russian, containment, at, the, bosphorus, strait, and, the, black, sea, germany, hosted, the, congress, of, berlin, in, 1878, where, a, more, moderate, peace, settlement, was, agreed, upon, in, 1879, germany, formed, the, dual, alliance, with, austria, hungary, an, agreement, of, mutual, military, assistance, in, the, case, of, an, attack, from, russia, which, was, not, satisfied, with, the, agreement, of, the, congress, of, berlin, the, establishment, of, the, dual, alliance, led, russia, to, take, a, more, conciliatory, stance, and, in, 1887, the, so, called, reinsurance, treaty, was, signed, between, germany, and, russia, in, it, the, two, powers, agreed, on, mutual, military, support, in, the, case, that, france, attacked, germany, or, an, austrian, attack, on, russia, russia, turned, its, attention, eastward, to, asia, and, remained, largely, inactive, in, european, politics, for, the, next, 25, years, in, 1882, italy, seeking, supporters, for, its, interests, in, north, africa, against, france, s, colonial, policy, joined, the, dual, alliance, which, became, the, triple, alliance, in, return, for, german, and, austrian, support, italy, committed, itself, to, assisting, germany, in, the, case, of, a, french, attack, bismarck, had, always, argued, that, the, acquisition, of, overseas, colonies, was, impractical, and, the, burden, of, administration, and, maintenance, would, outweigh, the, benefits, eventually, bismarck, gave, way, and, a, number, of, colonies, were, established, in, africa, togo, the, cameroons, german, south, west, africa, and, german, east, africa, and, in, oceania, german, new, guinea, the, bismarck, archipelago, and, the, marshall, islands, consequently, bismarck, initiated, the, berlin, conference, of, 1885, a, formal, meeting, of, the, european, colonial, powers, who, sought, to, established, international, guidelines, for, the, acquisition, of, african, territory, see, colonisation, of, africa, its, outcome, the, general, act, of, the, berlin, conference, can, be, seen, as, the, formalisation, of, the, scramble, for, africa, and, new, imperialism, emperor, william,

months, after, his, coronation, his, son, wilhelm, ii, followed, him, on, the, throne, at, the, age, of, 29, wilhelm, rejected, the, liberal, ideas, of, his, parents, and, embarked, on, a, conservative, autocratic, rule, he, early, on, decided, to, replace, the, political, elite, and, in, march, 1890, he, forced, chancellor, bismarck, into, retirement, following, his, principle, of, personal, regiment, wilhelm, was, determined, to, exercise, maximum, influence, on, all, government, affairs, the, young, kaiser, wilhelm, set, out, to, apply, his, imperialist, ideas, of, weltpolitik, german, world, politics, as, he, envisaged, a, gratuitously, aggressive, political, course, to, increase, the, empire, s, influence, in, and, control, over, the, world, after, the, removal, of, bismarck, foreign, policies, were, tackled, with, by, the, kaiser, and, the, federal, foreign, office, under, friedrich, von, holstein, wilhelm, s, increasingly, erratic, and, reckless, conduct, was, unmistakably, related, to, character, deficits, and, the, lack, of, diplomatic, skills, the, foreign, office, s, rather, sketchy, assessment, of, the, current, situation, and, its, recommendations, for, the, empire, s, most, suitable, course, of, action, were, first, a, long, term, coalition, between, france, and, russia, had, to, fall, apart, secondly, russia, and, britain, would, never, get, together, and, finally, britain, would, eventually, seek, an, alliance, with, germany, subsequently, wilhelm, refused, to, renew, the, reinsurance, treaty, with, russia, russia, promptly, formed, a, closer, relationship, with, france, in, the, dual, alliance, of, 1894, as, both, countries, were, concerned, about, the, novel, disagreeability, of, germany, furthermore, anglo, german, relations, provided, from, a, british, point, of, view, no, basis, for, any, consensus, as, the, kaiser, refused, to, divert, from, his, although, somewhat, peculiarly, desperate, and, anachronistic, aggressive, imperial, engagement, and, the, naval, arms, race, in, particular, holstein, s, analysis, proved, to, be, mistaken, on, every, point, and, wilhelm, failed, too, as, he, did, not, adopt, a, nuanced, political, dialogue, germany, was, left, gradually, isolated, and, dependent, on, the, triple, alliance, with, austria, hungary, and, italy, this, agreement, was, hampered, by, differences, between, austria, and, italy, and, in, 1915, italy, left, the, alliance, in, 1897, admiral, alfred, von, tirpitz, state, secretary, of, the, german, imperial, naval, office, devised, his, initially, rather, practical, yet, nonetheless, ambitious, plan, to, build, a, sizeable, naval, force, although, basically, posing, only, an, indirect, threat, as, a, fleet, in, being, tirpitz,

island, into, a, naval, base, and, installed, immense, coastal, defense, batteries, britain, considered, the, imperial, german, endeavours, to, be, a, dangerous, infringement, on, the, century, old, delicate, balance, of, global, affairs, and, trade, on, the, seas, under, british, control, the, british, however, resolved, to, keep, up, the, naval, arms, race, and, introduced, the, highly, advanced, new, dreadnought, battleship, concept, in, 1907, germany, quickly, adopted, the, concept, and, by, 1910, the, arms, race, again, escalated, in, the, first, moroccan, crisis, of, 1905, germany, nearly, clashed, with, britain, and, france, when, the, latter, attempted, to, establish, a, protectorate, over, morocco, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, was, upset, at, having, not, been, informed, about, french, intentions, and, declared, their, support, for, moroccan, independence, william, ii, made, a, highly, provocative, speech, regarding, this, the, following, year, a, conference, was, held, in, which, all, of, the, european, powers, except, austria, hungary, by, now, little, more, than, a, german, satellite, sided, with, france, a, compromise, was, brokered, by, the, united, states, where, the, french, relinquished, some, but, not, all, control, over, morocco, the, second, moroccan, crisis, of, 1911, saw, another, dispute, over, morocco, erupt, when, france, tried, to, suppress, a, revolt, there, germany, still, smarting, from, the, previous, quarrel, agreed, to, a, settlement, whereby, the, french, ceded, some, territory, in, central, africa, in, exchange, for, germany, s, renouncing, any, right, to, intervene, in, moroccan, affairs, this, confirmed, french, control, over, morocco, which, became, a, full, protectorate, of, that, country, in, 1912, by, 1890,

consisting, chiefly, of, russia, france, britain, and, in, 1915, italy, in, explaining, why, neutral, britain, went, to, war, with, germany, author, paul, m, kennedy, recognized, it, was, critical, for, war, that, germany, become, economically, more, powerful, than, britain, but, he, downplays, the, disputes, over, economic, trade, imperialism, the, baghdad, railway, confrontations, in, central, and, eastern, europe, high, charged, political, rhetoric, and, domestic, pressure, groups, germany, s, reliance, time, and, again, on, sheer, power, while, britain, increasingly, appealed, to, moral, sensibilities, played, a, role, especially, in, seeing, the, invasion, of, belgium, as, a, necessary, military, tactic, or, a, profound, moral, crime, the, german, invasion, of, belgium, was, not, important, because, the, british, decision, had, already, been, made, and, the, british, were, more, concerned, with, the, fate, of, france, kennedy, argues, that, by, far, the, main, reason, was, london, s, fear, that, a, repeat, of, 1870, when, prussia, and, the, german, states, smashed, france, would, mean, that, germany, with, a, powerful, army, and, navy, would, control, the, english, channel, and, northwest, france, british, policy, makers, insisted, that, would, be, a, catastrophe, for, british, security, in, the, west, germany, sought, a, quick, victory, by, encircling, paris, using, the, schlieffen, plan, but, it, failed, due, to, belgian, resistance, berlin, s, diversion, of, troops, and, very, stiff, french, resistance, on, the, marne, north, of, paris, the, western, front, became, an, extremely, bloody, battleground, of, trench, warfare, the, stalemate, lasted, from, 1914, until, early, 1918, with, ferocious, battles, that, moved, forces, a, few, hundred, yards, at, best, along, a, line, that, stretched, from, the, north, sea, to, the, swiss, border, the, british, imposed, a, tight, naval, blockade, in, the, north, sea, which, lasted, until, 1919, sharply, reducing, germany, s, overseas, access, to, raw, materials, and, foodstuffs, food, scarcity, became, a, serious, problem, by, 1917, the, united, states, joined, with, the, allies, in, april, 1917, the, entry, of, the, united, states, into, the, war, following, germany, s, declaration, of, unrestricted, submarine, warfare, marked, a, decisive, turning, point, against, germany, total, casualties,

the, russian, army, the, trapping, and, defeat, of, large, parts, of, the, russian, contingent, at, the, battle, of, tannenberg, followed, by, huge, austrian, and, german, successes, the, breakdown, of, russian, forces, exacerbated, by, internal, turmoil, caused, by, the, 1917, russian, revolution, led, to, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, the, bolsheviks, were, forced, to, sign, on, 3, march, 1918, as, russia, withdrew, from, the, war, it, gave, germany, control, of, eastern, europe, spencer, tucker, says, the, german, general, staff, had, formulated, extraordinarily, harsh, terms, that, shocked, even, the, german, negotiator, when, germany, later, complained, that, the, treaty, of, versailles, of, 1919, was, too, harsh, on, them, the, allies, responded, that, it, was, more, benign, than, brest, litovsk, by, defeating, russia, in, 1917, germany, was, able, to, bring, hundreds, of, thousands, of, combat, troops, from, the, east, to, the, western, front, giving, it, a, numerical, advantage, over, the, allies, by, retraining, the, soldiers, in, new, storm, trooper, tactics, the, germans, expected, to, unfreeze, the, battlefield, and, win, a, decisive, victory, before, the, american, army, arrived, in, strength, however, the, spring, offensives, all, failed, as, the, allies, fell, back, and, regrouped, and, the, germans, lacked, the, reserves, necessary, to, consolidate, their, gains, in, the, summer, with, the, americans, arriving, at, 10, 000, a, day, and, the, german, reserves, exhausted, it, was, only, a, matter, of, time, before, multiple, allied, offenses,

the, flight, and, expulsion, of, germans, and, through, forced, labour, in, the, soviet, union, this, figure, remained, unchallenged, until, the, 1990s, when, some, historians, put, the, death, toll, at, 500, 000, 600, 000, confirmed, deaths, in, 2006, the, german, government, reaffirmed, its, position, that, 2, 0, 2, 5, million, deaths, occurred, denazification, removed, imprisoned, or, executed,

and, the, alleged, constant, threat, of, a, west, german, invasion, many, of, her, citizens, looked, to, the, west, for, political, freedoms, and, economic, prosperity, walter, ulbricht, was, the, party, boss, from, 1950, to, 1971, in, 1933, ulbricht, had, fled, to, moscow, where, he, served, as, a, comintern, agent, loyal, to, stalin, as, world, war, ii, was, ending, stalin, assigned, him, the, job, of, designing, the, postwar, german, system, that, would, centralize, all, power, in, the, communist, party, ulbricht, became, deputy, prime, minister, in, 1949, and, secretary, chief,

who, attempted, it, what, the, gdr, called, the, anti, fascist, protective, wall, was, a, major, embarrassment, for, the, program, during, the, cold, war, but, it, did, stabilize, east, germany, and, postpone, its, collapse, ulbricht, lost, power, in, 1971, but, was, kept, on, as, a, nominal, head, of, state, he, was, replaced, because, he, failed, to, solve, growing, national, crises, such, as, the, worsening, economy, in, 1969, 1970, the, fear, of, another, popular, uprising, as, had, occurred, in, 1953, and, the, disgruntlement, between, moscow, and, berlin, caused, by, ulbricht, s, d, tente, policies, toward, the, west, the, transition, to, erich, honecker, general, secretary, from, 1971, to, 1989, led, to, a, change, in, the, direction, of, national, policy, and, efforts, by, the, politburo, to, pay, closer, attention, to, the, grievances, of, the, proletariat, honecker, s, plans, were, not, successful, however, with, the, dissent, growing, among, east, germany, s, population, in, 1989, the, socialist, regime, collapsed, after, 40, years, despite, its, omnipresent, secret, police, the, stasi, the, main, reasons, for, its, collapse, included, severe, economic, problems, and, growing, emigration, towards, the, west, east, germany, s, culture, was, shaped, by, communism, and, particularly, stalinism, it, was, characterized, by, east, german, psychoanalyst, hans, joachim, maaz, in, 1990, as, having, produced, a, congested, feeling, among, germans, in, the, east, as, a, result, of, communist, policies, criminalizing, personal, expression, that, deviates, from, government, approved, ideals, and, through, the, enforcement, of, communist, principals, by, physical, force, and, intellectual, repression, by, government, agencies, particularly, the, stasi, critics, of, the, east, german, state, have, claimed, that, the, state, s, commitment, to, communism, was, a, hollow, and, cynical, tool, of, a, ruling, elite, this, argument, has, been, challenged, by, some, scholars, who, claim, that, the, party, was, committed, to, the, advance, of, scientific, knowledge, economic, development, and, social, progress, however, the, vast, majority, regarded, the, state, s, communist, ideals, to, be, nothing, more, than, a, deceptive, method, for, government, control, according, to, german, historian, j, rgen, kocka, 2010, on, 23, may, 1949, the, three, western, occupation, zones, american, british, and, french, were, combined, into, the, federal, republic, of, germany, frg, west, germany, the, government, was, formed, under, chancellor, konrad, adenauer, and, his, conservative, cdu, csu, coalition, the, cdu, csu, was, in, power, during, most, of, the, period, since, 1949, the, capital, was, bonn, until, it, was, moved, to, berlin, in, 1990, in, 1990, frg, absorbed, east, germany, and, gained, full, sovereignty, over, berlin, at, all, points, west, germany, was, much, larger, and, richer, than, east, germany, which, became, a, dictatorship, under, the, control, of, the, communist, party, and, was, closely, monitored, by, moscow, germany, especially, berlin, was, a, cockpit, of, the, cold, war, with, nato, and, the, warsaw, pact, assembling, major, military, forces, in, west, and, east, however, there, was, never, any, combat, west, germany, enjoyed, prolonged, economic, growth, beginning, in, the, early, 1950s, wirtschaftswunder, or, economic, miracle, industrial, production, doubled, from, 1950, to, 1957, and, gross, national, product, grew, at, a, rate, of, 9, or, 10, per, year, providing, the, engine, for, economic, growth, of, all, of, western, europe, labor, unions, supported, the, new, policies, with, postponed, wage, increases, minimized, strikes, support, for, technological, modernization, and, a, policy, of, co, determination, mitbestimmung, which, involved, a, satisfactory, grievance, resolution, system, as, well, as, requiring, representation, of, workers, on, the, boards, of, large, corporations, the, recovery, was, accelerated, by, the, currency, reform, of, june, 1948, u, s, gifts, of, 1, 4, billion, as, part, of, the, marshall, plan, the, breaking, down, of, old, trade, barriers, and, traditional, practices, and, the, opening, of, the, global, market, west, germany, gained, legitimacy, and, respect, as, it, shed, the, horrible, reputation, germany, had, gained, under, the, nazis, west, germany, played, a, central, role, in, the, creation, of, european, cooperation, it, joined, nato, in, 1955, and, was, a, founding, member, of, the, european, economic, community, in, 1958, the, most, dramatic, and, successful, policy, event, was, the, currency, reform, of, 1948, since, the, 1930s, prices, and, wages, had, been, controlled, but, money, had, been, plentiful, that, meant, that, people, had, accumulated, large, paper, assets, and, that, official, prices, and, wages, did, not, reflect, reality, as, the, black, market, dominated, the, economy, and, more, than, half, of, all, transactions, were, taking, place, unofficially, on, 21, june, 1948, the, western, allies, withdrew, the, old, currency, and, replaced, it, with, the, new, deutsche, mark, at, the, rate, of, 1, new, per, 10, old, this, wiped, out, 90, of, government, and, private, debt, as, well, as, private, savings, prices, were, decontrolled, and, labor, unions, agreed, to, accept, a, 15, wage, increase, despite, the, 25, rise, in, prices, the, result, was, that, prices, of, german, export, products, held, steady, while, profits, and, earnings, from, exports, soared, and, were, poured, back, into, the, economy, the, currency, reforms, were, simultaneous, with, the, 1, 4, billion, in, marshall, plan, money, coming, in, from, the, united, states, which, was, used, primarily, for, investment, in, addition, the, marshall, plan, forced, german, companies, as, well, as, those, in, all, of, western, europe, to, modernize, their, business, practices, and, take, account, of, the, international, market, marshall, plan, funding, helped, overcome, bottlenecks, in, the, surging, economy, caused, by, remaining, controls, which, were, removed, in, 1949, and, marshall, plan, business, reforms, opened, up, a, greatly, expanded, market, for, german, exports, overnight, consumer, goods, appeared, in, the, stores, because, they, could, be, sold, for, realistic, prices, emphasizing, to, germans, that, their, economy, had, turned, a, corner, the, success, of, the, currency, reform, angered, the, soviets, who, cut, off, all, road, rail, and, canal, links, between, the, western, zones, and, west, berlin, this, was, the, berlin, blockade, which, lasted, from, 24, june, 1948, to, 12, may, 1949, in, response, the, u, s, and, britain, launched, an, airlift, of, food, and, coal, and, distributed, the, new, currency, in, west, berlin, as, well, the, city, thereby, became, economically, integrated, into, west, germany, until, the, mid, 1960s, it, served, as, america,

leader, in, west, germany, he, was, the, first, chancellor, top, official, of, the, frg, and, until, his, death, was, the, founder, and, leader, of, the, christian, democratic, union, cdu, a, coalition, of, conservatives, ordoliberals, and, adherents, of, protestant, and, catholic, social, teaching, that, dominated, west, germany, politics, for, most, of, its, history, during, his, chancellorship, the, west, germany, economy, grew, quickly, and, west, germany, established, friendly, relations, with, france, participated, in, the, emerging, european, union, established, the, country, s, armed, forces, the, bundeswehr, and, became, a, pillar, of, nato, as, well, as, firm, ally, of, the, united, states, adenauer, s, government, also, commenced, the, long, process, of, reconciliation, with, the, jews, and, israel, after, the, holocaust, ludwig, erhard, was, in, charge, of, economic, policy, as, economics, director, for, the, british, and, american, occupation, zones, and, was, adenauer, s, long, time, economics, minister, erhard, s, decision, to, lift, many, price, controls, in, 1948, despite, opposition, from, both, the, social, democratic, opposition, and, allied, authorities, plus, his, advocacy, of, free, markets, helped, set, the, federal, republic, on, its, strong, growth, from, wartime, devastation, norbert, walter, a, former, chief, economist, at, deutsche, bank, argues, that, germany, owes, its, rapid, economic, advance, after, world, war, ii, to, the, system, of, the, social, market, economy, established, by, ludwig, erhard, erhard, was, politically, less, successful, when, he, served, as, the, cdu, chancellor, from, 1963, until, 1966, erhard, followed, the, concept, of, a, social, market, economy, and, was, in, close, touch, with, professional, economists, erhard, viewed, the, market, itself, as, social, and, supported, only, a, minimum, of, welfare, legislation, however, erhard, suffered, a, series, of, decisive, defeats, in, his, effort, to, create, a, free, competitive, economy, in, 1957, he, had, to, compromise, on, such, key, issues, as, the, anti, cartel, legislation, thereafter, the, west, german,
