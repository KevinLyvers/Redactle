the, maurya, empire, ashokan, prakrit, m, gadhe, was, a, geographically, extensive, iron, age, historical, power, in, south, asia, based, in, magadha, present, day, bihar, it, was, the, fourth, ruling, dynasty, of, magadha, founded, by, chandragupta, maurya, in, 322, bce, it, existed, in, loose, knit, fashion, until, 185, bce, the, empire, was, centralized, by, the, conquest, of, the, indo, gangetic, plain, its, capital, city, was, located, at, pataliputra, modern, patna, outside, this, imperial, centre, the, empire, s, geographical, extent, was, dependent, on, the, loyalty, of, military, commanders, who, controlled, the, armed, cities, scattered, within, it, during, ashoka, s, rule, ca, 268, 232, bce, the, empire, briefly, controlled, the, major, urban, hubs, and, arteries, of, the, indian, subcontinent, excepting, the, deep, south, it, declined, for, about, 50, years, after, ashoka, s, rule, and, dissolved, in, 185, bce, with, the, assassination, of, brihadratha, by, pushyamitra, shunga, and, foundation, of, the, shunga, dynasty, in, magadha, chandragupta, maurya, raised, an, army, with, the, assistance, of, chanakya, author, of, the, arthashastra, and, overthrew, the, nanda, empire, in, c, 322, bce, chandragupta, rapidly, expanded, his, power, westwards, across, central, and, western, india, by, conquering, the, satraps, left, by, alexander, the, great, and, by, 317, bce, the, empire, had, fully, occupied, northwestern, india, the, mauryan, empire, then, defeated, seleucus, i, a, diadochus, and, founder, of, the, seleucid, empire, during, the, seleucid, mauryan, war, thus, acquiring, territory, west, of, the, indus, river, under, the, mauryas, internal, and, external, trade, agriculture, and, economic, activities, thrived, and, expanded, across, south, asia, due, to, the, creation, of, a, single, and, efficient, system, of, finance, administration, and, security, the, maurya, dynasty, built, uttarapath, a, precursor, of, the, grand, trunk, road, from, patliputra, to, taxila, after, the, kalinga, war, the, empire, experienced, nearly, half, a, century, of, centralized, rule, under, ashoka, ashoka, s, embrace, of, buddhism, and, sponsorship, of, buddhist, missionaries, allowed, for, the, expansion, of, that, faith, into, sri, lanka, northwest, india, and, central, asia, the, population, of, south, asia, during, the, mauryan, period, has, been, estimated, to, be, between, 15, and, 30, million, the, empire, s, period, of, dominion, was, marked, by, exceptional, creativity, in, art, architecture, inscriptions, and, produced, texts, but, also, by, the, consolidation, of, caste, in, the, gangetic, plain, and, the, declining, rights, of, women, in, the, mainstream, indo, aryan, speaking, regions, of, india, archaeologically, the, period, of, mauryan, rule, in, south, asia, falls, into, the, era, of, northern, black, polished, ware, nbpw, the, arthashastra, and, the, edicts, of, ashoka, are, the, primary, sources, of, written, records, of, mauryan, times, the, lion, capital, of, ashoka, at, sarnath, is, the, state, emblem, of, the, republic, of, india, the, name, maurya, does, not, occur, in, ashoka, s, inscriptions, or, the, contemporary, greek, accounts, such, as, megasthenes, s, indica, but, it, is, attested, by, the, following, sources, according, to, some, scholars, kharavela, hathigumpha, inscription, 2nd, 1st, century, bc, mentions, era, of, maurya, empire, as, muriya, kala, mauryan, era, but, this, reading, is, disputed, other, scholars, such, as, epigraphist, d, c, sircar, read, the, phrase, as, mukhiya, kala, the, principal, art, according, to, the, buddhist, tradition, the, ancestors, of, the, maurya, kings, had, settled, in, a, region, where, peacocks, mora, in, pali, were, abundant, therefore, they, came, to, be, known, as, moriyas, literally, meaning, belonging, to, the, place, of, peacocks, according, to, another, buddhist, account, these, ancestors, built, a, city, called, moriya, nagara, moriya, city, which, was, so, called, because, it, was, built, with, the, bricks, coloured, like, peacocks, necks, the, dynasty, s, connection, to, the, peacocks, as, mentioned, in, the, buddhist, and, jain, traditions, seems, to, be, corroborated, by, archaeological, evidence, for, example, peacock, figures, are, found, on, the, ashoka, pillar, at, nandangarh, and, several, sculptures, on, the, great, stupa, of, sanchi, based, on, this, evidence, modern, scholars, theorize, that, the, peacock, may, have, been, the, dynasty, s, emblem, some, later, authors, such, as, dhundhi, raja, an, 18th, century, commentator, on, the, mudrarakshasa, and, an, annotator, of, the, vishnu, purana, state, that, the, word, maurya, is, derived, from, mura, and, the, mother, of, the, first, maurya, emperor, however, the, puranas, themselves, make, no, mention, of, mura, and, do, not, talk, of, any, relation, between, the, nanda, and, the, maurya, dynasties, dhundiraja, s, derivation, of, the, word, seems, to, be, his, own, invention, according, to, the, sanskrit, rules, the, derivative, of, the, feminine, name, mura, iast, mur, would, be, maureya, the, term, maurya, can, only, be, derived, from, the, masculine, mura, prior, to, the, maurya, empire, the, nanda, empire, ruled, over, a, broad, swathe, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, nanda, empire, was, a, large, militaristic, and, economically, powerful, empire, due, to, conquering, the, mahajanapadas, according, to, several, legends, chanakya, travelled, to, pataliputra, magadha, the, capital, of, the, nanda, empire, where, chanakya, worked, for, the, nandas, as, a, minister, however, chanakya, was, insulted, by, the, emperor, dhana, nanda, when, he, informed, them, of, alexander, s, invasion, chanakya, swore, revenge, and, vowed, to, destroy, the, nanda, empire, he, had, to, flee, in, order, to, save, his, life, and, went, to, taxila, a, notable, center, of, learning, to, work, as, a, teacher, on, one, of, his, travels, chanakya, witnessed, some, young, men, playing, a, rural, game, practicing, a, pitched, battle, one, of, the, boys, was, none, other, than, chandragupta, chanakya, was, impressed, by, the, young, chandragupta, and, saw, imperial, qualities, in, him, as, someone, fit, to, rule, meanwhile, alexander, the, great, was, leading, his, indian, campaigns, and, ventured, into, punjab, his, army, mutinied, at, the, beas, river, and, refused, to, advance, farther, eastward, when, confronted, by, another, army, alexander, returned, to, babylon, and, re, deployed, most, of, his, troops, west, of, the, indus, river, soon, after, alexander, died, in, babylon, in, 323, bce, his, empire, fragmented, into, independent, kingdoms, led, by, his, generals, the, maurya, empire, was, established, in, the, magadha, region, under, the, leadership, of, chandragupta, maurya, and, his, mentor, chanakya, chandragupta, was, taken, to, taxila, by, chanakya, and, was, tutored, about, statecraft, and, governing, requiring, an, army, chandragupta, recruited, and, annexed, local, military, republics, such, as, the, yaudheyas, that, had, resisted, alexander, s, empire, the, mauryan, army, quickly, rose, to, become, the, prominent, regional, power, in, the, north, west, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, mauryan, army, then, conquered, the, satraps, established, by, the, macedonians, ancient, greek, historians, nearchus, onesictrius, and, aristobolus, have, provided, lot, of, information, about, the, mauryan, empire, the, greek, generals, eudemus, and, peithon, ruled, in, the, indus, valley, until, around, 317, bce, when, chandragupta, maurya, with, the, help, of, chanakya, who, was, now, his, advisor, fought, and, drove, out, the, greek, governors, and, subsequently, brought, the, indus, valley, under, the, control, of, his, new, seat, of, power, in, magadha, chandragupta, maurya, s, ancestry, is, shrouded, in, mystery, and, controversy, on, one, hand, a, number, of, ancient, indian, accounts, such, as, the, drama, mudrarakshasa, signet, ring, of, rakshasa, rakshasa, was, the, prime, minister, of, magadha, by, vishakhadatta, describe, his, imperial, ancestry, and, even, link, him, with, the, nanda, family, a, kshatriya, clan, known, as, the, mauryas, are, referred, to, in, the, earliest, buddhist, texts, mah, parinibb, na, sutta, however, any, conclusions, are, hard, to, make, without, further, historical, evidence, chandragupta, first, emerges, in, greek, accounts, as, sandrokottos, as, a, young, man, he, is, said, to, have, met, alexander, chanakya, is, said, to, have, met, the, nanda, emperor, angered, him, and, made, a, narrow, escape, historically, reliable, details, of, chandragupta, s, campaign, against, nanda, empire, are, unavailable, and, legends, written, centuries, later, are, inconsistent, buddhist, jain, and, hindu, texts, claim, magadha, was, ruled, by, the, nanda, dynasty, which, with, chanakya, s, counsel, chandragupta, conquered, nanda, empire, the, army, of, chandragupta, and, chanakya, first, conquered, the, nanda, outer, territories, and, finally, besieged, the, nanda, capital, pataliputra, in, contrast, to, the, easy, victory, in, buddhist, sources, the, hindu, and, jain, texts, state, that, the, campaign, was, bitterly, fought, because, the, nanda, dynasty, had, a, powerful, and, well, trained, army, the, buddhist, mahavamsa, tika, and, jain, parishishtaparvan, records, chandragupta, s, army, unsuccessfully, attacking, the, nanda, capital, chandragupta, and, chanakya, then, began, a, campaign, at, the, frontier, of, the, nanda, empire, gradually, conquering, various, territories, on, their, way, to, the, nanda, capital, he, then, refined, his, strategy, by, establishing, garrisons, in, the, conquered, territories, and, finally, besieged, the, nanda, capital, pataliputra, there, dhana, nanda, accepted, defeat, the, conquest, was, fictionalised, in, mudrarakshasa, play, it, contains, narratives, not, found, in, other, versions, of, the, chanakya, chandragupta, legend, because, of, this, difference, thomas, trautmann, suggests, that, most, of, it, is, fictional, or, legendary, without, any, historical, basis, radha, kumud, mukherjee, similarly, considers, mudrakshasa, play, without, historical, basis, these, legends, state, that, the, nanda, emperor, was, defeated, deposed, and, exiled, by, some, accounts, while, buddhist, accounts, claim, he, was, killed, with, the, defeat, of, dhana, nanda, chandragupta, maurya, founded, the, maurya, empire, after, the, death, of, alexander, the, great, in, 323, bce, chandragupta, led, a, series, of, campaigns, in, 305, bce, to, take, satrapies, in, the, indus, valley, and, northwest, india, when, alexander, s, remaining, forces, were, routed, returning, westwards, seleucus, i, nicator, fought, to, defend, these, territories, not, many, details, of, the, campaigns, are, known, from, ancient, sources, seleucus, was, defeated, and, retreated, into, the, mountainous, region, of, afghanistan, the, two, rulers, concluded, a, peace, treaty, in, 303, bce, including, a, marital, alliance, under, its, terms, chandragupta, received, the, satrapies, of, paropamisadae, kamboja, and, gandhara, and, arachosia, kandahar, province, and, gedrosia, balochistan, seleucus, i, received, the, 500, war, elephants, that, were, to, have, a, decisive, role, in, his, victory, against, western, hellenistic, kings, at, the, battle, of, ipsus, in, 301, bce, diplomatic, relations, were, established, and, several, greeks, such, as, the, historian, megasthenes, deimachus, and, dionysius, resided, at, the, mauryan, court, megasthenes, in, particular, was, a, notable, greek, ambassador, in, the, court, of, chandragupta, maurya, his, book, indika, is, a, major, literary, source, for, information, about, the, mauryan, empire, according, to, arrian, ambassador, megasthenes, c, 350, c, 290, bce, lived, in, arachosia, and, travelled, to, pataliputra, megasthenes, description, of, mauryan, society, as, freedom, loving, gave, seleucus, a, means, to, avoid, invasion, however, underlying, seleucus, decision, was, the, improbability, of, success, in, later, years, seleucus, successors, maintained, diplomatic, relations, with, the, empire, based, on, similar, accounts, from, returning, travellers, chandragupta, established, a, strong, centralised, state, with, an, administration, at, pataliputra, which, according, to, megasthenes, was, surrounded, by, a, wooden, wall, pierced, by, 64, gates, and, 570, towers, aelian, although, not, expressly, quoting, megasthenes, nor, mentioning, pataliputra, described, indian, palaces, as, superior, in, splendor, to, persia, s, susa, or, ecbatana, the, architecture, of, the, city, seems, to, have, had, many, similarities, with, persian, cities, of, the, period, chandragupta, s, son, bindusara, extended, the, rule, of, the, mauryan, empire, towards, southern, india, the, famous, tamil, poet, mamulanar, of, the, sangam, literature, described, how, areas, south, of, the, deccan, plateau, which, comprised, tamil, country, was, invaded, by, the, mauryan, army, using, troops, from, karnataka, mamulanar, states, that, vadugar, people, who, resided, in, andhra, karnataka, regions, immediately, to, the, north, of, tamil, nadu, formed, the, vanguard, of, the, mauryan, army, he, also, had, a, greek, ambassador, at, his, court, named, deimachus, according, to, plutarch, chandragupta, maurya, subdued, all, of, india, and, justin, also, observed, that, chandragupta, maurya, was, in, possession, of, india, these, accounts, are, corroborated, by, tamil, sangam, literature, which, mentions, about, mauryan, invasion, with, their, south, indian, allies, and, defeat, of, their, rivals, at, podiyil, hill, in, tirunelveli, district, in, present, day, tamil, nadu, chandragupta, renounced, his, throne, and, followed, jain, teacher, bhadrabahu, he, is, said, to, have, lived, as, an, ascetic, at, shravanabelagola, for, several, years, before, fasting, to, death, as, per, the, jain, practice, of, sallekhana, bindusara, was, born, to, chandragupta, the, founder, of, the, mauryan, empire, this, is, attested, by, several, sources, including, the, various, puranas, and, the, mah, va, sa, he, is, attested, by, the, buddhist, texts, such, as, d, pava, sa, and, mah, va, sa, bindusaro, the, jain, texts, such, as, parishishta, parvan, as, well, as, the, hindu, texts, such, as, vishnu, purana, vindusara, according, to, the, 12th, century, jain, writer, hemachandra, s, parishishta, parvan, the, name, of, bindusara, s, mother, was, durdhara, some, greek, sources, also, mention, him, by, the, name, amitrochates, or, its, variations, historian, upinder, singh, estimates, that, bindusara, ascended, the, throne, around, 297, bce, bindusara, just, 22, years, old, inherited, a, large, empire, that, consisted, of, what, is, now, northern, central, and, eastern, parts, of, india, along, with, parts, of, afghanistan, and, baluchistan, bindusara, extended, this, empire, to, the, southern, part, of, india, as, far, as, what, is, now, known, as, karnataka, he, brought, sixteen, states, under, the, mauryan, empire, and, thus, conquered, almost, all, of, the, indian, peninsula, he, is, said, to, have, conquered, the, land, between, the, two, seas, the, peninsular, region, between, the, bay, of, bengal, and, the, arabian, sea, bindusara, did, not, conquer, the, friendly, tamil, kingdoms, of, the, cholas, ruled, by, king, ilamcetcenni, the, pandyas, and, cheras, apart, from, these, southern, states, kalinga, modern, odisha, was, the, only, kingdom, in, india, that, did, not, form, part, of, bindusara, s, empire, it, was, later, conquered, by, his, son, ashoka, who, served, as, the, viceroy, of, avantirastra, during, his, father, s, reign, which, highlights, the, importance, of, the, province, bindusara, s, life, has, not, been, documented, as, well, as, that, of, his, father, chandragupta, or, of, his, son, ashoka, chanakya, continued, to, serve, as, prime, minister, during, his, reign, according, to, the, medieval, tibetan, scholar, taranatha, who, visited, india, chanakya, helped, bindusara, to, destroy, the, nobles, and, kings, of, the, sixteen, kingdoms, and, thus, to, become, absolute, master, of, the, territory, between, the, eastern, and, western, oceans, during, his, rule, the, citizens, of, taxila, revolted, twice, the, reason, for, the, first, revolt, was, the, maladministration, of, susima, his, eldest, son, the, reason, for, the, second, revolt, is, unknown, but, bindusara, could, not, suppress, it, in, his, lifetime, it, was, crushed, by, ashoka, after, bindusara, s, death, bindusara, maintained, friendly, diplomatic, relations, with, the, hellenic, world, deimachus, was, the, ambassador, of, seleucid, king, antiochus, i, at, bindusara, s, court, diodorus, states, that, the, king, of, palibothra, pataliputra, the, mauryan, capital, welcomed, a, greek, author, iambulus, this, king, is, usually, identified, as, bindusara, pliny, states, that, the, ptolemaic, king, philadelphus, sent, an, envoy, named, dionysius, to, india, according, to, sailendra, nath, sen, this, appears, to, have, happened, during, bindusara, s, reign, unlike, his, father, chandragupta, who, at, a, later, stage, converted, to, jainism, bindusara, believed, in, the, ajivika, religion, bindusara, s, guru, pingalavatsa, janasana, was, a, brahmin, of, the, ajivika, religion, bindusara, s, wife, empress, subhadrangi, was, a, brahmin, also, of, the, ajivika, religion, from, champa, present, bhagalpur, district, bindusara, is, credited, with, giving, several, grants, to, brahmin, monasteries, brahmana, bhatto, historical, evidence, suggests, that, bindusara, died, in, the, 270s, bce, according, to, upinder, singh, bindusara, died, around, 273, bce, alain, dani, lou, believes, that, he, died, around, 274, bce, sailendra, nath, sen, believes, that, he, died, around, 273, 272, bce, and, that, his, death, was, followed, by, a, four, year, struggle, of, succession, after, which, his, son, ashoka, became, the, emperor, in, 269, 268, bce, according, to, the, mah, va, sa, bindusara, reigned, for, 28, years, the, vayu, purana, which, names, chandragupta, s, successor, as, bhadrasara, states, that, he, ruled, for, 25, years, as, a, young, prince, ashoka, r, 272, 232, bce, was, a, brilliant, commander, who, crushed, revolts, in, ujjain, and, taxila, as, emperor, he, was, ambitious, and, aggressive, re, asserting, the, empire, s, superiority, in, southern, and, western, india, but, it, was, his, conquest, of, kalinga, 262, 261, bce, which, proved, to, be, the, pivotal, event, of, his, life, ashoka, used, kalinga, to, project, power, over, a, large, region, by, building, a, fortification, there, and, securing, it, as, a, possession, although, ashoka, s, army, succeeded, in, overwhelming, kalinga, forces, of, royal, soldiers, and, citizen, militias, an, estimated, 100, 000, soldiers, and, civilians, were, killed, in, the, furious, warfare, including, over, 10, 000, of, imperial, mauryan, soldiers, hundreds, of, thousands, of, people, were, adversely, affected, by, the, destruction, and, fallout, of, war, when, he, personally, witnessed, the, devastation, ashoka, began, feeling, remorse, although, the, annexation, of, kalinga, was, completed, ashoka, embraced, the, teachings, of, buddhism, and, renounced, war, and, violence, he, sent, out, missionaries, to, travel, around, asia, and, spread, buddhism, to, other, countries, he, also, propagated, his, own, dhamma, ashoka, implemented, principles, of, ahimsa, by, banning, hunting, and, violent, sports, activity, and, abolishing, slave, trade, while, he, maintained, a, large, and, powerful, army, to, keep, the, peace, and, maintain, authority, ashoka, expanded, friendly, relations, with, states, across, asia, and, europe, and, he, sponsored, buddhist, missions, he, undertook, a, massive, public, works, building, campaign, across, the, country, over, 40, years, of, peace, harmony, and, prosperity, made, ashoka, one, of, the, most, successful, and, famous, monarchs, in, indian, history, he, remains, an, idealized, figure, of, inspiration, in, modern, india, the, edicts, of, ashoka, set, in, stone, are, found, throughout, the, subcontinent, ranging, from, as, far, west, as, afghanistan, and, as, far, south, as, andhra, nellore, district, ashoka, s, edicts, state, his, policies, and, accomplishments, although, predominantly, written, in, prakrit, two, of, them, were, written, in, greek, and, one, in, both, greek, and, aramaic, ashoka, s, edicts, refer, to, the, greeks, kambojas, and, gandharas, as, peoples, forming, a, frontier, region, of, his, empire, they, also, attest, to, ashoka, s, having, sent, envoys, to, the, greek, rulers, in, the, west, as, far, as, the, mediterranean, the, edicts, precisely, name, each, of, the, rulers, of, the, hellenistic, world, at, the, time, such, as, amtiyoko, antiochus, ii, theos, tulamaya, ptolemy, ii, amtikini, antigonos, ii, maka, magas, and, alikasudaro, alexander, ii, of, epirus, as, recipients, of, ashoka, s, proselytism, the, edicts, also, accurately, locate, their, territory, 600, yojanas, away, 1, yojana, being, about, 7, miles, corresponding, to, the, distance, between, the, center, of, india, and, greece, roughly, 4, 000, miles, ashoka, was, followed, for, 50, years, by, a, succession, of, weaker, emperors, he, was, succeeded, by, dasharatha, maurya, who, was, ashoka, s, grandson, none, of, ashoka, s, sons, could, ascend, to, the, throne, after, him, mahinda, his, firstborn, became, a, buddhist, monk, kunala, maurya, was, blinded, and, hence, couldn, t, ascend, to, the, throne, and, tivala, son, of, karuvaki, died, even, earlier, than, ashoka, little, is, known, about, another, son, jalauka, the, empire, lost, many, territories, under, dasharatha, which, were, later, reconquered, by, samprati, kunala, s, son, post, samprati, the, mauryas, slowly, lost, many, territories, in, 180, bce, brihadratha, maurya, was, killed, by, his, general, pushyamitra, shunga, in, a, military, parade, without, any, heir, hence, the, great, maurya, empire, finally, ended, giving, rise, to, the, shunga, empire, reasons, advanced, for, the, decline, include, the, succession, of, weak, emperors, after, ashoka, maurya, the, partition, of, the, empire, into, two, the, growing, independence, of, some, areas, within, the, empire, such, as, that, ruled, by, sophagasenus, a, top, heavy, administration, where, authority, was, entirely, in, the, hands, of, a, few, persons, an, absence, of, any, national, consciousness, the, pure, scale, of, the, empire, making, it, unwieldy, and, invasion, by, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, some, historians, such, as, hem, chandra, raychaudhuri, have, argued, that, ashoka, s, pacifism, undermined, the, military, backbone, of, the, maurya, empire, others, such, as, romila, thapar, have, suggested, that, the, extent, and, impact, of, his, pacifism, have, been, grossly, exaggerated, buddhist, records, such, as, the, ashokavadana, write, that, the, assassination, of, brihadratha, and, the, rise, of, the, shunga, empire, led, to, a, wave, of, religious, persecution, for, buddhists, and, a, resurgence, of, hinduism, according, to, sir, john, marshall, pushyamitra, may, have, been, the, main, author, of, the, persecutions, although, later, shunga, kings, seem, to, have, been, more, supportive, of, buddhism, other, historians, such, as, etienne, lamotte, and, romila, thapar, among, others, have, argued, that, archaeological, evidence, in, favour, of, the, allegations, of, persecution, of, buddhists, are, lacking, and, that, the, extent, and, magnitude, of, the, atrocities, have, been, exaggerated, the, fall, of, the, mauryas, left, the, khyber, pass, unguarded, and, a, wave, of, foreign, invasion, followed, the, greco, bactrian, king, demetrius, capitalized, on, the, breakup, and, he, conquered, southern, afghanistan, and, parts, of, northwestern, india, around, 180, bce, forming, the, indo, greek, kingdom, the, indo, greeks, would, maintain, holdings, on, the, trans, indus, region, and, make, forays, into, central,

the, modern, city, of, sialkot, however, the, extent, of, their, domains, and, the, lengths, of, their, rule, are, subject, to, much, debate, numismatic, evidence, indicates, that, they, retained, holdings, in, the, subcontinent, right, up, to, the, birth, of, christ, although, the, extent, of, their, successes, against, indigenous, powers, such, as, the, shungas, satavahanas, and, kalinga, are, unclear, what, is, clear, is, that, scythian, tribes, named, indo, scythians, brought, about, the, demise, of, the, indo, greeks, from, around, 70, bce, and, retained, lands, in, the, trans,

arthashastra, chandragupta, maurya, established, a, single, currency, across, india, and, a, network, of, regional, governors, and, administrators, and, a, civil, service, provided, justice, and, security, for, merchants, farmers, and, traders, the, mauryan, army, wiped, out, many, gangs, of, bandits, regional, private, armies, and, powerful, chieftains, who, sought, to, impose, their, own, supremacy, in, small, areas, although, regimental, in, revenue, collection, mauryas, also, sponsored, many, public, works, and, waterways, to, enhance, productivity, while, internal, trade, in, india, expanded, greatly, due, to, new, found, political, unity, and, internal, peace, under, the, indo, greek, friendship, treaty, and, during, ashoka, s, reign, an, international, network, of, trade, expanded, the, khyber, pass, on, the, modern, boundary, of, pakistan, and, afghanistan, became, a, strategically, important, port, of, trade, and, intercourse, with, the, outside, world, greek,

ashoka, also, sponsored, the, construction, of, thousands, of, roads, waterways, canals, hospitals, rest, houses, and, other, public, works, the, easing, of, many, over, rigorous, administrative, practices, including, those, regarding, taxation, and, crop, collection, helped, increase, productivity, and, economic, activity, across, the, empire, in, many, ways, the, economic, situation, in, the, mauryan, empire, is, analogous, to, the, roman, empire, of, several, centuries, later, both, had, extensive, trade, connections, and, both, had, organizations, similar, to, corporations, while, rome, had, organizational, entities, which, were, largely, used, for, public, state, driven, projects, mauryan, india, had, numerous, private, commercial, entities, these, existed, purely, for, private, commerce, and, developed, before, the, mauryan, empire, itself, while, brahmanism, was, an, important, religion, throughout, the, period, of, the, empire, the, mauryans, were, rooted, in, the, non, vedic, magadha, realm, and, favored, jainism, buddhism, and, ajivikism, brahmanism, which, had, developed, in, the, conquered, kuru, panchala, realn, lost, its, privileges, which, threatened, its, very, existence, and, pressured, it, to, transform, itself, into, a, socio, political, ideology, which, eventually, became, influential, far, beyond, the, confines, of, its, original, homeland, resulting, in, the, hindu, synthesis, in, which, brahmanical, ideology, local, traditions, and, elements, from, the, sramana, traditions, were, synthesized, while, according, to, greek, traveller, megasthenes, chandragupta, maurya, sponsored, brahmanical, rituals, and, sacrifices, according, to, a, jain, text, from, the, 12th, century, chandragupta, maurya, followed, jainism, after, retiring, when, he, renounced, his, throne, and, material, possessions, to, join, a, wandering, group, of, jain, monks, and, in, his, last, days, he, observed, the, rigorous, but, self, purifying, jain, ritual, of, santhara, fast, unto, death, at, shravana, belgola, in, karnataka, though, it, is, also, possible, that, they, are, talking, about, his, great, grandson, samprati, the, grandson, of, ashoka, patronized, jainism, samprati, was, influenced, by, the, teachings, of, jain, monks, like, suhastin, and, he, is, said, to, have, built, 125, 000, derasars, across, india, some, of, them, are, still, found, in, the, towns, of, ahmedabad, viramgam, ujjain, and, palitana, it, is, also, said, that, just, like, ashoka, samprati, sent, messengers, and, preachers, to, greece, persia, and, the, middle, east, for, the, spread, of, jainism, but, to, date, no, evidence, has, been, found, to, support, this, claim, the, buddhist, texts, samantapasadika, and, mah, va, sa, suggest, that, bindusara, followed, brahmanism, calling, him, a, brahmana, bhatto, devotee, of, the, brahmins, magadha, the, centre, of, the, empire, was, also, the, birthplace, of, buddhism, in, later, life, ashoka, followed, buddhism, following, the, kalinga, war, he, renounced, expansionism, and, aggression, and, the, harsher, injunctions, of, the, arthashastra, on, the, use, of, force, intensive, policing, and, ruthless, measures, for, tax, collection, and, against, rebels, ashoka, sent, a, mission, led, by, his, son, mahinda, and, daughter, sanghamitta, to, sri, lanka, whose, king, tissa, was, so, charmed, with, buddhist, ideals, that, he, adopted, them, himself, and, made, buddhism, the, state, religion, ashoka, sent, many, buddhist, missions, to, west, asia, greece, and, south, east, asia, and, commissioned, the, construction, of, monasteries, and, schools, as, well, as, the, publication, of, buddhist, literature, across, the, empire, he, is, believed, to, have, built, as, many, as, 84, 000, stupas, across, india, such, as, sanchi, and, mahabodhi, temple, and, he, increased, the, popularity, of, buddhism, in, afghanistan, and, thailand, ashoka, helped, convene, the, third, buddhist, council, of, india, s, and, south, asia, s, buddhist, orders, near, his, capital, a, council, that, undertook, much, work, of, reform, and, expansion, of, the, buddhist, religion, indian, merchants, embraced, buddhism, and, played, a, large, role, in, spreading, the, religion, across, the, mauryan, empire, the, population, of, south, asia, during, the, mauryan, period, has, been, estimated, to, be, between, 15, and, 30, million, according, to, tim, dyson, the, period, of, the, mauryan, empire, saw, the, consolidation, of, caste, among, the, indo, aryan, people, who, had, settled, in, the, gangetic, plain, increasingly, meeting, tribal, people, who, were, incorporated, into, their, evolving, caste, system, and, the, declining, rights, of, women, in, the, indo, aryan, speaking, regions, of, india, though, these, developments, did, not, affect, people, living, in, large, parts, of, the, subcontinent, the, greatest, monument, of, this, period, executed, in, the, reign, of, chandragupta, maurya, was, the, old, palace, at, paliputra, modern, kumhrar, in, patna, excavations, have, unearthed, the, remains, of, the, palace, which, is, thought, to, have, been, a, group, of, several, buildings, the, most, important, of, which, was, an, immense, pillared, hall, supported, on, a, high, substratum, of, timbers, the, pillars, were, set, in, regular, rows, thus, dividing, the, hall, into, a, number, of, smaller, square, bays, the, number, of, columns, is, 80, each, about, 7, meters, high, according, to, the, eyewitness, account, of, megasthenes, the, palace, was, chiefly, constructed, of, timber, and, was, considered, to, exceed, in, splendour, and, magnificence, the, palaces, of, susa, and, ecbatana, its, gilded, pillars, being, adorned, with, golden, vines, and, silver, birds, the, buildings, stood, in, an, extensive, park, studded, with, fish, ponds, and, furnished, with, a, great, variety, of, ornamental, trees, and, shrubs, kau, ilya, s, arthashastra, also, gives, the, method, of, palace, construction, from, this, period, later, fragments, of, stone, pillars, including, one, nearly, complete, with, their, round, tapering, shafts, and, smooth, polish, indicate, that, ashoka, was, responsible, for, the, construction, of, the, stone, columns, which, replaced, the, earlier, wooden, ones, during, the, ashokan, period, stonework, was, of, a, highly, diversified, order, and, comprised, lofty, free, standing, pillars, railings, of, stupas, lion, thrones, and, other, colossal, figures, the, use, of, stone, had, reached, such, great, perfection, during, this, time, that, even, small, fragments, of, stone, art, were, given, a, high, lustrous, polish, resembling, fine, enamel, this, period, marked, the, beginning, of, buddhist, architecture, ashoka, was, responsible, for, the, construction, of, several, stupas, which, were, large, domes, and, bearing, symbols, of, buddha, the, most, important, ones, are, located, at, sanchi, bodhgaya, bharhut, and, possibly, amaravati, stupa, the, most, widespread, examples, of, mauryan, architecture, are, the, ashoka, pillars, and, carved, edicts, of, ashoka, often, exquisitely, decorated, with, more, than, 40, spread, throughout, the, indian, subcontinent, the, peacock, was, a, dynastic, symbol, of, mauryans, as, depicted, by, ashoka, s, pillars, at, nandangarh, and, sanchi, stupa, the, protection, of, animals, in, india, was, advocated, by, the, time, of, the, maurya, dynasty, being, the, first, empire, to, provide, a, unified, political, entity, in, india, the, attitude, of, the, mauryas, towards, forests, their, denizens, and, fauna, in, general, is, of, interest, the, mauryas, firstly, looked, at, forests, as, resources, for, them, the, most, important, forest, product, was, the, elephant, military, might, in, those, times, depended, not, only, upon, horses, and, men, but, also, battle, elephants, these, played, a, role, in, the, defeat, of, seleucus, one, of, alexander, the, great, s, former, generals, the, mauryas, sought, to, preserve, supplies, of, elephants, since, it, was, cheaper, and, took, less, time, to, catch, tame, and, train, wild, elephants, than, to, raise, them, kautilya, s, arthashastra, contains, not, only, maxims, on, ancient, statecraft, but, also, unambiguously, specifies, the, responsibilities, of, officials, such, as, the, protector, of, the, elephant, forests, on, the, border, of, the, forest, he, should, establish, a, forest, for, elephants, guarded, by, foresters, the, office, of, the, chief, elephant, forester, should, with, the, help, of, guards, protect, the, elephants, in, any, terrain, the, slaying, of, an, elephant, is, punishable, by, death, the, mauryas, also, designated, separate, forests, to, protect, supplies, of, timber, as, well, as, lions, and, tigers, for, skins, elsewhere, the, protector, of, animals, also, worked, to, eliminate, thieves, tigers, and, other, predators, to, render, the, woods, safe, for, grazing, cattle, the, mauryas, valued, certain, forest, tracts, in, strategic, or, economic, terms, and, instituted, curbs, and, control, measures, over, them, they, regarded, all, forest, tribes, with, distrust, and, controlled, them, with, bribery, and, political, subjugation, they, employed, some, of, them, the, food, gatherers, or, aranyaca, to, guard, borders, and, trap, animals, the, sometimes, tense, and, conflict, ridden, relationship, nevertheless, enabled, the, mauryas, to, guard, their, vast, empire, when, ashoka, embraced, buddhism, in, the, latter, part, of, his, reign, he, brought, about, significant, changes, in, his, style, of, governance, which, included, providing, protection, to, fauna, and, even, relinquished, the, royal, hunt, he, was, the, first, ruler, in, history, to, advocate, conservation, measures, for, wildlife, and, even, had, rules, inscribed, in, stone, edicts, the, edicts, proclaim, that, many, followed, the, emperor, s, example, in, giving, up, the, slaughter, of, animals, one, of, them, proudly, states, our, king, killed, very, few, animals, however, the, edicts, of, ashoka, reflect, more, the, desire, of, rulers, than, actual, events, the, mention, of, a, 100, panas, coins, fine, for, poaching, deer, in, imperial, hunting, preserves, shows, that, rule, breakers, did, exist, the, legal, restrictions, conflicted, with, the, practices, freely, exercised, by, the, common, people, in, hunting, felling, fishing, and, setting, fires, in, forests, relations, with, the, hellenistic, world, may, have, started, from, the, very, beginning, of, the, maurya, empire, plutarch, reports, that, chandragupta, maurya, met, with, alexander, the, great, probably, around, taxila, in, the, northwest, sandrocottus, when, he, was, a, stripling, saw, alexander, himself, and, we, are, told, that, he, often, said, in, later, times, that, alexander, narrowly, missed, making, himself, master, of, the, country, since, its, king, was, hated, and, despised, on, account, of, his, baseness, and, low, birth, chandragupta, ultimately, occupied, northwestern, india, in, the, territories, formerly, ruled, by, the, greeks, where, he, fought, the, satraps, described, as, prefects, in, western, sources, left, in, place, after, alexander, justin, among, whom, may, have, been, eudemus, ruler, in, the, western, punjab, until, his, departure, in, 317, bce, or, peithon, son, of, agenor, ruler, of, the, greek, colonies, along, the, indus, until, his, departure, for, babylon, in, 316, bce, india, after, the, death, of, alexander, had, assassinated, his, prefects, as, if, shaking, the, burden, of, servitude, the, author, of, this, liberation, was, sandracottos, but, he, had, transformed, liberation, in, servitude, after, victory, since, after, taking, the, throne, he, himself, oppressed, the, very, people, he, has, liberated, from, foreign, domination, later, as, he, was, preparing, war, against, the, prefects, of, alexander, a, huge, wild, elephant, went, to, him, and, took, him, on, his, back, as, if, tame, and, he, became, a, remarkable, fighter, and, war, leader, having, thus, acquired, royal, power, sandracottos, possessed, india, at, the, time, seleucos, was, preparing, future, glory, seleucus, i, nicator, the, macedonian, satrap, of, the, asian, portion, of, alexander, s, former, empire, conquered, and, put, under, his, own, authority, eastern, territories, as, far, as, bactria, and, the, indus, appian, history, of, rome, the, syrian, wars, 55, until, in, 305, bce, he, entered, into, a, confrontation, with, emperor, chandragupta, always, lying, in, wait, for, the, neighbouring, nations, strong, in, arms, and, persuasive, in, council, he, acquired, mesopotamia, armenia, seleucid, cappadocia, persis, parthia, bactria, arabia, tapouria, sogdia, arachosia, hyrcania, and, other, adjacent, peoples, that, had, been, subdued, by, alexander, as, far, as, the, river, indus, so, that, the, boundaries, of, his, empire, were, the, most, extensive, in, asia, after, that, of, alexander, the, whole, region, from, phrygia, to, the, indus, was, subject, to, seleucus, though, no, accounts, of, the, conflict, remain, it, is, clear, that, seleucus, fared, poorly, against, the, indian, emperor, as, he, failed, to, conquer, any, territory, and, in, fact, was, forced, to, surrender, much, that, was, already, his, regardless, seleucus, and, chandragupta, ultimately, reached, a, settlement, and, through, a, treaty, sealed, in, 305, bce, seleucus, according, to, strabo, ceded, a, number, of, territories, to, chandragupta, including, eastern, afghanistan, and, balochistan, chandragupta, and, seleucus, concluded, a, peace, treaty, and, a, marriage, alliance, in, 303, bce, chandragupta, received, vast, territories, and, in, a, return, gave, seleucus, 500, war, elephants, a, military, asset, which, would, play, a, decisive, role, at, the, battle, of, ipsus, in, 301, bce, in, addition, to, this, treaty, seleucus, dispatched, an, ambassador, megasthenes, to, chandragupta, and, later, deimakos, to, his, son, bindusara, at, the, mauryan, court, at, pataliputra, modern, patna, in, bihar, later, ptolemy, ii, philadelphus, the, ruler, of, ptolemaic, egypt, and, contemporary, of, ashoka, is, also, recorded, by, pliny, the, elder, as, having, sent, an, ambassador, named, dionysius, to, the, mauryan, court, mainstream, scholarship, asserts, that, chandragupta, received, vast, territory, west, of, the, indus, including, the, hindu, kush, modern, day, afghanistan, and, the, balochistan, province, of, pakistan, archaeologically, concrete, indications, of, mauryan, rule, such, as, the, inscriptions, of, the, edicts, of, ashoka, are, known, as, far, as, kandahar, in, southern, afghanistan, he, seleucus, crossed, the, indus, and, waged, war, with, sandrocottus, king, of, the, indians, who, dwelt, on, the, banks, of, that, stream, until, they, came, to, an, understanding, with, each, other, and, contracted, a, marriage, relationship, after, having, made, a, treaty, with, him, sandrakotos, and, put, in, order, the, orient, situation, seleucos, went, to, war, against, antigonus, the, treaty, on, epigamia, implies, lawful, marriage, between, greeks, and, indians, was, recognized, at, the, state, level, although, it, is, unclear, whether, it, occurred, among, dynastic, rulers, or, common, people, or, both, classical, sources, have, also, recorded, that, following, their, treaty, chandragupta, and, seleucus, exchanged, presents, such, as, when, chandragupta, sent, various, aphrodisiacs, to, seleucus, and, theophrastus, says, that, some, contrivances, are, of, wondrous, efficacy, in, such, matters, and, phylarchus, confirms, him, by, reference, to, some, of, the, presents, which, sandrakottus, the, king, of, the, indians, sent, to, seleucus, which, were, to, act, like, charms, in, producing, a, wonderful, degree, of, affection, while, some, on, the, contrary, were, to, banish, love, his, son, bindusara, amitraghata, slayer, of, enemies, also, is, recorded, in, classical, sources, as, having, exchanged, presents, with, antiochus, i, but, dried, figs, were, so, very, much, sought, after, by, all, men, for, really, as, aristophanes, says, there, s, really, nothing, nicer, than, dried, figs, that, even, amitrochates, the, king, of, the, indians, wrote, to, antiochus, entreating, him, it, is, hegesander, who, tells, this, story, to, buy, and, send, him, some, sweet, wine, and, some, dried, figs, and, a, sophist, and, that, antiochus, wrote, to, him, in, answer, the, dry, figs, and, the, sweet, wine, we, will, send, you, but, it, is, not, lawful, for, a, sophist, to, be, sold, in, greece, an, influential, and, large, greek, population, was, present, in, the, northwest, of, the, indian, subcontinent, under, ashoka, s, rule, possibly, remnants, of, alexander, s, conquests, in, the, indus, valley, region, in, the, rock, edicts, of, ashoka, some, of, them, inscribed, in, greek, ashoka, states, that, the, greeks, within, his, dominion, were, converted, to, buddhism, here, in, the, king,

morality, even, among, the, greeks, kambojas, and, gandharas, and, whatever, other, western, borderers, of, mine, there, are, fragments, of, edict, 13, have, been, found, in, greek, and, a, full, edict, written, in, both, greek, and, aramaic, has, been, discovered, in, kandahar, it, is, said, to, be, written, in, excellent, classical, greek, using, sophisticated, philosophical, terms, in, this, edict, ashoka, uses, the, word, eusebeia, piety, as, the, greek, translation, for, the, ubiquitous, dharma, of, his, other, edicts, written, in, prakrit, ten, years, of, reign, having, been, completed, king, piodasses, ashoka, made, known, the, doctrine, of, piety, eusebeia, to, men, and, from, this, moment, he, has, made, men, more, pious, and, everything, thrives, throughout, the,
