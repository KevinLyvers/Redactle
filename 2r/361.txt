an, armed, conflict, that, was, part, of, the, broader, american, revolution, in, which, american, patriot, forces, organized, as, the, continental, army, and, commanded, by, george, washington, defeated, the, british, army, during, the, war, north, american, patriot, forces, had, the, support, of, france, spain, and, the, dutch, republic, while, the, british, and, loyalist, forces, hired, hessian, soldiers, from, germany, for, assistance, the, conflict, was, fought, in, north, america, the, caribbean, and, the, atlantic, ocean, the, war, ended, with, the, treaty, of, paris, in, 1783, which, resulted, in, great, britain, ultimately, recognizing, the, independence, and, sovereignty, of, the, united, states, the, american, colonies, were, established, by, royal, charter, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, after, the, british, empire, gained, dominance, in, north, america, with, victory, over, the, french, in, the, seven, years, war, in, 1763, tensions, and, disputes, arose, between, great, britain, and, the, thirteen, colonies, over, a, variety, of, issues, including, the, stamp, and, townshend, acts, the, resulting, british, military, occupation, led, to, the, boston, massacre, in, 1770, which, strengthened, north, american, patriots, desire, for, independence, from, great, britain, among, further, tensions, the, british, parliament, imposed, the, intolerable, acts, in, mid, 1774, a, british, attempt, to, disarm, the, americans, and, the, resulting, battles, of, lexington, and, concord, in, april, 1775, ignited, the, war, in, june, the, second, continental, congress, formalized, patriot, militias, into, the, continental, army, and, appointed, washington, its, commander, in, chief, the, british, parliament, declared, the, colonies, to, be, in, a, state, of, rebellion, in, august, 1775, the, stakes, of, the, war, were, formalized, with, passage, of, the, lee, resolution, by, the, congress, in, philadelphia, on, july, 2, 1776, and, the, unanimous, ratification, of, the, declaration, of, independence, two, days, later, on, july, 4, 1776, after, a, successful, siege, washington, s, forces, drove, the, british, army, out, of, boston, in, march, 1776, and, british, commander, in, chief, william, howe, responded, by, launching, the, new, york, and, new, jersey, campaign, howe, captured, new, york, city, in, november, washington, responded, by, clandestinely, crossing, the, delaware, river, and, winning, small, but, significant, victories, at, trenton, and, princeton, which, restored, patriot, confidence, in, the, summer, of, 1777, as, howe, was, poised, to, capture, philadelphia, the, continental, congress, fled, to, baltimore, in, october, 1777, a, separate, northern, british, force, under, the, command, of, john, burgoyne, was, forced, to, surrender, at, saratoga, in, an, american, victory, that, proved, crucial, in, convincing, france, and, spain, that, an, independent, united, states, was, a, viable, possibility, after, saratoga, france, signed, a, commercial, agreement, with, the, rebels, followed, by, a, treaty, of, alliance, in, february, 1778, in, 1779, the, sullivan, expedition, undertook, a, scorched, earth, campaign, against, the, iroquois, who, were, largely, allied, with, the, british, indian, raids, on, the, american, frontier, however, continued, to, be, a, problem, also, in, 1779, spain, allied, with, france, against, great, britain, in, the, treaty, of, aranjuez, though, spain, did, not, formally, ally, with, the, americans, howe, s, replacement, henry, clinton, intended, to, take, the, war, against, the, americans, into, the, southern, colonies, despite, some, initial, success, british, general, cornwallis, was, besieged, by, a, franco, american, force, in, yorktown, in, september, and, october, 1781, cornwallis, was, forced, to, surrender, in, october, the, british, wars, with, france, and, spain, continued, for, another, two, years, but, fighting, largely, ceased, in, north, america, in, april, 1782, the, north, ministry, was, replaced, by, a, new, british, government, which, accepted, american, independence, and, began, negotiating, the, treaty, of, paris, ratified, on, september, 3, 1783, great, britain, acknowledged, the, sovereignty, and, independence, of, the, united, states, of, america, bringing, the, american, revolutionary, war, to, an, end, the, treaties, of, versailles, resolved, great, britain, s, conflicts, with, france, and, spain, and, forced, great, britain, to, cede, tobago, senegal, and, small, territories, in, india, to, france, and, menorca, west, florida, and, east, florida, to, spain, the, french, and, indian, war, part, of, the, wider, global, conflict, known, as, the, seven, years, war, ended, with, the, 1763, peace, of, paris, which, expelled, france, from, their, possessions, in, new, france, acquisition, of, territories, in, atlantic, canada, and, west, florida, inhabited, largely, by, french, and, spanish, speaking, catholics, led, british, authorities, to, consolidate, their, hold, by, populating, them, with, english, speaking, settlers, preventing, conflict, between, settlers, and, indian, tribes, west, of, the, appalachian, mountains, also, avoided, the, cost, of, an, expensive, military, occupation, the, royal, proclamation, of, 1763, was, designed, to, achieve, these, aims, by, refocusing, colonial, expansion, north, into, nova, scotia, and, south, into, florida, with, the, mississippi, river, as, the, dividing, line, between, british, and, spanish, possessions, in, america, settlement, was, tightly, restricted, beyond, the, 1763, limits, and, claims, west, of, this, line, including, by, virginia, and, massachusetts, were, rescinded, despite, the, fact, that, each, colony, argued, that, their, boundaries, extended, from, the, atlantic, ocean, to, the, pacific, ocean, the, vast, exchange, of, territory, ultimately, destabilized, existing, alliances, and, trade, networks, between, settlers, and, indians, in, the, west, while, it, proved, impossible, to, prevent, encroachment, beyond, the, proclamation, line, with, the, exception, of, virginia, and, others, deprived, of, rights, to, western, lands, the, colonial, legislatures, agreed, on, the, boundaries, but, disagreed, on, where, to, set, them, many, settlers, resented, the, restrictions, entirely, and, enforcement, required, permanent, garrisons, along, the, frontier, which, led, to, increasingly, bitter, disputes, over, who, should, pay, for, them, although, directly, administered, by, the, crown, acting, through, a, local, governor, the, colonies, were, largely, governed, by, native, born, property, owners, while, external, affairs, were, managed, by, london, colonial, militia, were, funded, locally, but, with, the, ending, of, the, french, threat, in, 1763, the, legislatures, expected, less, taxation, not, more, at, the, same, time, the, huge, debt, incurred, by, the, seven, years, war, and, demands, from, british, taxpayers, for, cuts, in, government, expenditure, meant, parliament, expected, the, colonies, to, fund, their, own, defense, the, new, taxes, levied, on, subjects, in, the, colonies, proved, highly, burdensome, in, colonies, such, as, north, carolina, particularly, for, the, poorer, classes, and, quickly, became, a, source, of, much, discontent, the, 1763, to, 1765, grenville, ministry, instructed, the, royal, navy, to, cease, trading, smuggled, goods, and, enforce, customs, duties, levied, in, american, ports, the, most, important, was, the, 1733, molasses, act, routinely, ignored, before, 1763, it, had, a, significant, economic, impact, since, 85, of, new, england, rum, exports, were, manufactured, from, imported, molasses, these, measures, were, followed, by, the, sugar, act, and, stamp, act, which, imposed, additional, taxes, on, the, colonies, to, pay, for, defending, the, western, frontier, in, july, 1765, the, whigs, formed, the, first, rockingham, ministry, which, repealed, the, stamp, act, and, reduced, tax, on, foreign, molasses, to, help, the, new, england, economy, but, re, asserted, parliamentary, authority, in, the, declaratory, act, however, this, did, little, to, end, the, discontent, in, 1768, a, riot, started, in, boston, when, the, authorities, seized, the, sloop, liberty, on, suspicion, of, smuggling, tensions, escalated, further, in, march, 1770, when, british, troops, fired, on, rock, throwing, civilians, killing, five, in, what, became, known, as, the, boston, massacre, the, massacre, coincided, with, the, partial, repeal, of, the, townshend, acts, by, the, tory, based, north, ministry, which, came, to, power, in, january, 1770, and, remained, in, office, until, 1781, north, insisted, on, retaining, duty, on, tea, to, enshrine, parliament, s, right, to, tax, the, colonies, the, amount, was, minor, but, ignored, the, fact, it, was, that, very, principle, americans, found, objectionable, in, april, 1772, colonialists, staged, the, first, american, tax, revolt, in, weare, new, hampshire, against, the, british, royal, authority, later, referred, to, as, the, pine, tree, riot, this, occurrence, would, later, inspire, the, design, of, the, pine, tree, flag, tensions, escalated, following, the, destruction, of, a, customs, vessel, in, the, june, 1772, gaspee, affair, then, came, to, a, head, in, 1773, a, banking, crisis, led, to, the, near, collapse, of, the, east, india, company, which, dominated, the, british, economy, to, support, it, parliament, passed, the, tea, act, giving, it, a, trading, monopoly, in, the, thirteen, colonies, since, most, american, tea, was, smuggled, by, the, dutch, the, act, was, opposed, by, those, who, managed, the, illegal, trade, while, being, seen, as, yet, another, attempt, to, impose, the, principle, of, taxation, by, parliament, in, december, 1773, a, group, called, the, sons, of, liberty, disguised, as, mohawk, natives, dumped, 342, crates, of, tea, into, the, boston, harbor, an, event, later, known, as, the, boston, tea, party, the, british, parliament, responded, by, passing, the, so, called, intolerable, acts, aimed, specifically, at, massachusetts, although, many, colonists, and, members, of, the, whig, opposition, considered, them, a, threat, to, liberty, in, general, this, led, to, increased, sympathy, for, the, patriot, cause, locally, in, the, british, parliament, and, in, the, london, press, throughout, the, 18th, century, the, elected, lower, houses, in, the, colonial, legislatures, gradually, wrested, power, from, their, governors, dominated, by, smaller, landowners, and, merchants, these, assemblies, now, established, ad, hoc, provincial, legislatures, variously, called, congresses, conventions, and, conferences, effectively, replacing, royal, control, with, the, exception, of, georgia, twelve, colonies, sent, representatives, to, the, first, continental, congress, to, agree, on, a, unified, response, to, the, crisis, many, of, the, delegates, feared, that, an, all, out, boycott, would, result, in, war, and, sent, a, petition, to, the, king, calling, for, the, repeal, of, the, intolerable, acts, however, after, some, debate, on, september, 17, 1774, congress, endorsed, the, massachusetts, suffolk, resolves, and, on, october, 20, passed, the, continental, association, based, on, a, draft, prepared, by, the, first, virginia, convention, in, august, the, association, instituted, economic, sanctions, and, a, full, boycott, of, goods, against, britain, while, denying, its, authority, over, internal, american, affairs, a, faction, led, by, james, duane, and, future, loyalist, joseph, galloway, insisted, congress, recognize, parliament, s, right, to, regulate, colonial, trade, expecting, concessions, by, the, north, administration, congress, authorized, the, extralegal, committees, and, conventions, of, the, colonial, legislatures, to, enforce, the, boycott, this, succeeded, in, reducing, british, imports, by, 97, from, 1774, to, 1775, however, on, february, 9, parliament, declared, massachusetts, to, be, in, a, state, of, rebellion, and, instituted, a, blockade, of, the, colony, in, july, the, restraining, acts, limited, colonial, trade, with, the, british, west, indies, and, britain, and, barred, new, england, ships, from, the, newfoundland, cod, fisheries, the, increase, in, tension, led, to, a, scramble, for, control, of, militia, stores, which, each, assembly, was, legally, obliged, to, maintain, for, defense, on, april, 19, a, british, attempt, to, secure, the, concord, arsenal, culminated, in, the, battles, of, lexington, and, concord, which, began, the, revolutionary, war, after, the, patriot, victory, at, concord, moderates, in, congress, led, by, john, dickinson, drafted, the, olive, branch, petition, offering, to, accept, royal, authority, in, return, for, george, iii, mediating, in, the, dispute, however, since, the, petition, was, immediately, followed, by, the, declaration, of, the, causes, and, necessity, of, taking, up, arms, colonial, secretary, lord, dartmouth, viewed, the, offer, as, insincere, he, refused, to, present, the, petition, to, the, king, which, was, therefore, rejected, in, early, september, although, constitutionally, correct, since, george, could, not, oppose, his, own, government, it, disappointed, those, americans, who, hoped, he, would, mediate, in, the, dispute, while, the, hostility, of, his, language, annoyed, even, loyalist, members, of, congress, combined, with, the, proclamation, of, rebellion, issued, on, august, 23, in, response, to, the, battle, at, bunker, hill, it, ended, hopes, of, a, peaceful, settlement, backed, by, the, whigs, parliament, initially, rejected, the, imposition, of, coercive, measures, by, 170, votes, fearing, an, aggressive, policy, would, simply, drive, the, americans, towards, independence, however, by, the, end, of, 1774, the, collapse, of, british, authority, meant, both, lord, north, and, george, iii, were, convinced, war, was, inevitable, after, boston, gage, halted, operations, and, awaited, reinforcements, the, irish, parliament, approved, the, recruitment, of, new, regiments, while, allowing, catholics, to, enlist, for, the, first, time, britain, also, signed, a, series, of, treaties, with, german, states, to, supply, additional, troops, within, a, year, it, had, an, army, of, over, 32, 000, men, in, america, the, largest, ever, sent, outside, europe, at, the, time, the, employment, of, german, soldiers, against, people, viewed, as, british, citizens, was, opposed, by, many, in, parliament, and, by, the, colonial, assemblies, combined, with, the, lack, of, activity, by, gage, opposition, to, the, use, of, foreign, troops, allowed, the, patriots, to, take, control, of, the, legislatures, support, for, independence, was, boosted, by, thomas, paine, s, pamphlet, common, sense, which, was, published, on, january, 10, 1776, and, argued, for, american, self, government, and, was, widely, reprinted, to, draft, the, declaration, of, independence, the, second, continental, congress, appointed, the, committee, of, five, consisting, of, thomas, jefferson, john, adams, benjamin, franklin, roger, sherman, and, robert, livingston, the, declaration, was, written, almost, exclusively, by, jefferson, who, wrote, it, largely, in, isolation, between, june, 11, and, june, 28, 1776, in, a, three, story, residence, at, 700, market, street, in, philadelphia, identifying, inhabitants, of, the, thirteen, colonies, as, one, people, the, declaration, simultaneously, dissolved, political, links, with, britain, while, including, a, long, list, of, alleged, violations, of, english, rights, committed, by, george, iii, this, is, also, one, of, the, first, times, that, the, colonies, were, referred, to, as, united, states, rather, than, the, more, common, united, colonies, on, july, 2, congress, voted, for, independence, and, published, the, declaration, on, july, 4, which, george, washington, read, to, his, troops, in, new, york, city, on, july, 9, at, this, point, the, revolution, ceased, to, be, an, internal, dispute, over, trade, and, tax, policies, and, had, evolved, into, a, civil, war, since, each, state, represented, in, congress, was, engaged, in, a, struggle, with, britain, but, also, split, between, american, patriots, and, american, loyalists, patriots, generally, supported, independence, from, britain, and, a, new, national, union, in, congress, while, loyalists, remained, faithful, to, british, rule, estimates, of, numbers, vary, one, suggestion, being, the, population, as, a, whole, was, split, evenly, between, committed, patriots, committed, loyalists, and, those, who, were, indifferent, others, calculate, the, split, as, 40, patriot, 40, neutral, 20, loyalist, but, with, considerable, regional, variations, at, the, onset, of, the, war, the, second, continental, congress, realized, defeating, britain, required, foreign, alliances, and, intelligence, gathering, the, committee, of, secret, correspondence, was, formed, for, the, sole, purpose, of, corresponding, with, our, friends, in, great, britain, and, other, parts, of, the, world, from, 1775, to, 1776, the, committee, shared, information, and, built, alliances, through, secret, correspondence, as, well, as, employing, secret, agents, in, europe, to, gather, intelligence, conduct, undercover, operations, analyze, foreign, publications, and, initiate, patriot, propaganda, campaigns, paine, served, as, secretary, while, benjamin, franklin, and, silas, deane, sent, to, france, to, recruit, military, engineers, were, instrumental, in, securing, french, aid, in, paris, the, revolutionary, war, included, two, principal, campaign, theaters, within, the, thirteen, colonies, and, a, smaller, but, strategically, important, third, one, west, of, the, appalachian, mountains, fighting, began, in, the, northern, theater, and, was, at, its, most, severe, from, 1775, to, 1778, american, patriots, achieved, several, strategic, victories, in, the, south, the, americans, defeated, the, british, army, at, saratoga, in, october, 1777, and, the, french, seeing, the, possibility, for, an, american, patriot, victory, in, the, war, formally, entered, the, war, as, an, american, ally, during, 1778, washington, prevented, the, british, army, from, breaking, out, of, new, york, city, while, militia, under, george, rogers, clark, conquered, western, quebec, supported, by, francophone, settlers, and, their, indian, allies, which, became, the, northwest, territory, the, war, became, a, stalemate, in, the, north, in, 1779, so, the, british, initiated, their, southern, strategy, which, aimed, to, mobilize, loyalist, support, in, the, region, and, occupy, american, patriot, controlled, territory, north, to, chesapeake, bay, the, campaign, was, initially, successful, with, the, british, capture, of, charleston, being, a, major, setback, for, southern, patriots, however, a, franco, american, force, surrounded, the, british, army, at, yorktown, and, their, surrender, in, october, 1781, effectively, ended, fighting, in, america, on, april, 14, 1775, sir, thomas, gage, commander, in, chief, north, america, since, 1763, and, also, governor, of, massachusetts, from, 1774, received, orders, to, take, action, against, the, patriots, he, decided, to, destroy, militia, ordnance, stored, at, concord, massachusetts, and, capture, john, hancock, and, samuel, adams, who, were, considered, the, principal, instigators, of, the, rebellion, the, operation, was, to, begin, around, midnight, on, april, 19, in, the, hope, of, completing, it, before, the, american, patriots, could, respond, however, paul, revere, learned, of, the, plan, and, notified, captain, parker, commander, of, the, concord, militia, who, prepared, to, resist, the, attempted, seizure, the, first, action, of, the, war, commonly, referred, to, as, the, shot, heard, round, the, world, was, a, brief, skirmish, at, lexington, followed, by, the, full, scale, battles, of, lexington, and, concord, british, troops, suffered, around, 300, casualties, before, withdrawing, to, boston, which, was, then, besieged, by, the, militia, in, may, 1775, 4, 500, british, reinforcements, arrived, under, generals, william, howe, john, burgoyne, and, sir, henry, clinton, on, june, 17, they, seized, the, charlestown, peninsula, at, the, battle, of, bunker, hill, a, frontal, assault, in, which, they, suffered, over, 1, 000, casualties, dismayed, at, the, costly, attack, which, had, gained, them, little, gage, appealed, to, london, for, a, larger, army, to, suppress, the, revolt, but, instead, was, replaced, as, commander, by, howe, on, june, 14, 1775, congress, took, control, of, american, patriot, forces, outside, boston, and, congressional, leader, john, adams, nominated, washington, as, commander, in, chief, of, the, newly, formed, continental, army, washington, previously, commanded, virginia, militia, regiments, in, the, french, and, indian, war, and, on, june, 16, hancock, officially, proclaimed, him, general, and, commander, in, chief, of, the, army, of, the, united, colonies, he, assumed, command, on, july, 3, preferring, to, fortify, dorchester, heights, outside, boston, rather, than, assaulting, it, in, early, march, 1776, colonel, henry, knox, arrived, with, heavy, artillery, acquired, in, the, capture, of, fort, ticonderoga, under, cover, of, darkness, on, march, 5, washington, placed, these, on, dorchester, heights, from, where, they, could, fire, on, the, town, and, british, ships, in, boston, harbor, fearing, another, bunker, hill, howe, evacuated, the, city, on, march, 17, without, further, loss, and, sailed, to, halifax, nova, scotia, while, washington, moved, south, to, new, york, city, beginning, in, august, 1775, american, privateers, raided, towns, in, nova, scotia, including, saint, john, charlottetown, and, yarmouth, in, 1776, john, paul, jones, and, jonathan, eddy, attacked, canso, and, fort, cumberland, respectively, british, officials, in, quebec, began, negotiating, with, the, iroquois, for, their, support, while, us, envoys, urged, them, to, remain, neutral, aware, of, native, american, leanings, toward, the, british, and, fearing, an, anglo, indian, attack, from, canada, congress, authorized, a, second, invasion, in, april, 1775, after, the, defeat, at, the, battle, of, quebec, on, december, 31, the, americans, maintained, a, loose, blockade, of, the, city, until, they, retreated, on, may, 6, 1776, a, second, defeat, at, trois, rivi, res, on, june, 8, ended, operations, in, quebec, british, pursuit, was, initially, blocked, by, american, naval, vessels, on, lake, champlain, until, victory, at, valcour, island, on, october, 11, forced, the, americans, to, withdraw, to, fort, ticonderoga, while, in, december, an, uprising, in, nova, scotia, sponsored, by, massachusetts, was, defeated, at, fort, cumberland, these, failures, impacted, public, support, for, the, patriot, cause, and, aggressive, anti, loyalist, policies, in, the, new, england, colonies, alienated, the, canadians, in, virginia, an, attempt, by, governor, lord, dunmore, to, seize, militia, stores, on, april, 20, 1775, led, to, an, increase, in, tension, although, conflict, was, avoided, for, the, time, being, this, changed, after, the, publication, of, dunmore, s, proclamation, on, november, 7, 1775, promising, freedom, to, any, slaves, who, fled, their, patriot, masters, and, agreed, to, fight, for, the, crown, british, forces, were, defeated, at, great, bridge, on, december, 9, and, took, refuge, on, british, ships, anchored, near, the, port, of, norfolk, when, the, third, virginia, convention, refused, to, disband, its, militia, or, accept, martial, law,

the, loyalists, were, subsequently, driven, out, of, the, colony, in, the, snow, campaign, loyalists, were, recruited, in, north, carolina, to, reassert, british, rule, in, the, south, but, they, were, decisively, defeated, in, the, battle, of, moore, s, creek, bridge, a, british, expedition, sent, to, reconquer, south, carolina, launched, an, attack, on, charleston, in, the, battle, of, sullivan, s, island, on, june, 28, 1776, but, it, failed, and, left, the, south, under, patriot, control, until, 1780, a, shortage, of, gunpowder, led, congress, to, authorize, a, naval, expedition, against, the, bahamas, to, secure, ordnance, stored, there, on, march, 3, 1776, an, american, squadron, under, the, command, of, esek, hopkins, landed, at, the, east, end, of, nassau, and,

munitions, that, was, so, great, he, had, to, impress, an, extra, ship, in, the, harbor, to, transport, the, supplies, back, home, when, he, departed, on, march, 17, a, month, later, after, a, brief, skirmish, with, hms, glasgow, they, returned, to, new, london, connecticut, the, base, for, american, naval, operations, during, the, revolution, after, regrouping, at, halifax, in, nova, scotia,

harbor, on, july, 2, the, americans, rejected, howe, s, informal, attempt, to, negotiate, peace, on, july, 30, washington, knew, that, an, attack, on, the, city, was, imminent, and, realized, that, he, needed, advance, information, to, deal, with, disciplined, british, regular, troops, on, august, 12, 1776, patriot, thomas, knowlton, was, given, orders, to, form, an, elite, group, for, reconnaissance, and, secret, missions, knowlton, s, rangers, which, included, nathan, hale, became, the, army, s, first, intelligence, unit, when, washington, was, driven, off, long, island, he, soon, realized, that, he, would, need, more, than, military, might, and, amateur, spies, to, defeat, the, british, he, was, committed, to, professionalizing, military, intelligence, with, aid, from, benjamin, tallmadge, washington, launched, the, six, man, culper, spy, ring, the, efforts, of, washington, and, the, culper, spy, ring, substantially, increased, the, effective, allocation, and, deployment, of, continental, regiments, in, the, field, throughout, the, war, washington, spent, more, than, 10, percent, of, his, total, military, funds, on, military, intelligence, operations, washington, split, the, continental, army, into, positions, on, manhattan, and, across, the, east, river, in, western, long, island, on, august, 27, at, the, battle, of, long, island, howe, outflanked, washington, and, forced, him, back, to, brooklyn, heights, but, he, did, not, attempt, to, encircle, washington, s, forces, through, the, night, of, august, 28, knox, bombarded, the, british, knowing, they, were, up, against, overwhelming, odds, washington, ordered, the, assembly, of, a, war, council, on, august, 29, all, agreed, to, retreat, to, manhattan, washington, quickly, had, his, troops, assembled, and, ferried, them, across, the, east, river, to, manhattan, on, flat, bottomed, freight, boats, without, any, losses, in, men, or, ordnance, leaving, general, thomas, mifflin, s, regiments, as, a, rearguard, howe, met, with, a, delegation, from, the, second, continental, congress, at, the, september, staten, island, peace, conference, but, it, failed, to, conclude, peace, largely, because, the, british, delegates, only, had, the, authority, to, offer, pardons, and, could, not, recognize, independence, on, september, 15, howe, seized, control, of, new, york, city, when, the, british, landed, at, kip, s, bay, and, unsuccessfully, engaged, the, americans, at, the, battle, of, harlem, heights, the, following, day, on, october, 18, howe, failed, to, encircle, the, americans, at, the, battle, of, pell, s, point, and, the, americans, withdrew, howe, declined, to, close, with, washington, s, army, on, october, 28, at, the, battle, of, white, plains, and, instead, attacked, a, hill, that, was, of, no, strategic, value, washington, s, retreat, isolated, his, remaining, forces, and, the, british, captured, fort, washington, on, november, 16, the, british, victory, there, amounted, to, washington, s, most, disastrous, defeat, with, the, loss, of, 3, 000, prisoners, the, remaining, american, regiments, on, long, island, fell, back, four, days, later, general, henry, clinton, wanted, to, pursue, washington, s, disorganized, army, but, he, was, first, required, to, commit, 6, 000, troops, to, capture, newport, rhode, island, to, secure, the, loyalist, port, general, charles, cornwallis, pursued, washington, but, howe, ordered, him, to, halt, leaving, washington, unmolested, the, outlook, following, the, defeat, at, fort, washington, appeared, bleak, for, the, american, cause, the, reduced, continental, army, had, dwindled, to, fewer, than, 5, 000, men, and, was, reduced, further, when, enlistments, expired, at, the, end, of, the, year, popular, support, wavered, and, morale, declined, on, december, 20, 1776, the, continental, congress, abandoned, the, revolutionary, capital, of, philadelphia, and, moved, to, baltimore, where, it, remained, for, over, two, months, until, february, 27, 1777, loyalist, activity, surged, in, the, wake, of, the, american, defeat, especially, in, new, york, state, in, london, news, of, the, victorious, long, island, campaign, was, well, received, with, festivities, held, in, the, capital, public, support, reached, a, peak, and, king, george, iii, awarded, the, order, of, the, bath, to, howe, strategic, deficiencies, among, patriot, forces, were, evident, washington, divided, a, numerically, weaker, army, in, the, face, of, a, stronger, one, his, inexperienced, staff, misread, the, military, situation, and, american, troops, fled, in, the, face, of, enemy, fire, the, successes, led, to, predictions, that, the, british, could, win, within, a, year, in, the, meantime, the, british, established, winter, quarters, in, the, new, york, city, area, and, anticipated, renewed, campaigning, the, following, spring, two, weeks, after, congress, withdrew, to, baltimore, on, the, night, of, december, 25, 26, 1776, washington, crossed, the, delaware, river, leading, a, column, of, continental, army, troops, from, today, s, bucks, county, pennsylvania, located, about, 30, miles, upriver, from, philadelphia, to, today, s, mercer, county, new, jersey, in, a, logistically, challenging, and, dangerous, operation, meanwhile, the, hessians, were, involved, in, numerous, clashes, with, small, bands, of, patriots, and, were, often, aroused, by, false, alarms, at, night, in, the, weeks, before, the, actual, battle, of, trenton, by, christmas, they, were, tired, and, weary, while, a, heavy, snowstorm, led, their, commander, colonel, johann, rall, to, assume, no, attack, of, any, consequence, would, occur, at, daybreak, on, the, 26th, the, american, patriots, surprised, and, overwhelmed, rall, and, his, troops, who, lost, over, 20, killed, including, rall, while, 900, prisoners, german, cannons, and, much, supply, were, captured, the, battle, of, trenton, restored, the, american, army, s, morale, reinvigorated, the, patriot, cause, and, dispelled, their, fear, of, what, they, regarded, as, hessian, mercenaries, a, british, attempt, to, retake, trenton, was, repulsed, at, assunpink, creek, on, january, 2, during, the, night, washington, outmaneuvered, cornwallis, then, defeated, his, rearguard, in, the, battle, of, princeton, the, following, day, the, two, victories, helped, convince, the, french, that, the, americans, were, worthy, military, allies, after, his, success, at, princeton, washington, entered, winter, quarters, at, morristown, new, jersey, where, he, remained, until, may, and, received, congressional, direction, to, inoculate, all, patriot, troops, against, smallpox, with, the, exception, of, a, minor, skirmishing, between, the, two, armies, which, continued, until, march, howe, made, no, attempt, to, attack, the, americans, the, 1776, campaign, demonstrated, that, regaining, new, england, would, be, a, prolonged, affair, which, led, to, a, change, in, british, strategy, this, involved, isolating, the, north, from, the, rest, of, the, country, by, taking, control, of, the, hudson, river, allowing, them, to, focus, on, the, south, where, loyalist, support, was, believed, to, be, substantial, in, december, 1776, howe, wrote, to, the, colonial, secretary, lord, germain, proposing, a, limited, offensive, against, philadelphia, while, a, second, force, moved, down, the, hudson, from, canada, germain, received, this, on, february, 23, 1777, followed, a, few, days, later, by, a, memorandum, from, burgoyne, then, in, london, on, leave, burgoyne, supplied, several, alternatives, all, of, which, gave, him, responsibility, for, the, offensive, with, howe, remaining, on, the, defensive, the, option, selected, required, him, to, lead, the, main, force, south, from, montreal, down, the, hudson, valley, while, a, detachment, under, barry, st, leger, moved, east, from, lake, ontario, the, two, would, meet, at, albany, leaving, howe, to, decide, whether, to, join, them, reasonable, in, principle, this, did, not, account, for, the, logistical, difficulties, involved, and, burgoyne, erroneously, assumed, howe, would, remain, on, the, defensive, germain, s, failure, to, make, this, clear, meant, he, opted, to, attack, philadelphia, instead, burgoyne, set, out, on, june, 14, 1777, with, a, mixed, force, of, british, regulars, professional, german, soldiers, and, canadian, militia, and, captured, fort, ticonderoga, on, july, 5, as, general, horatio, gates, retreated, his, troops, blocked, roads, destroyed, bridges, dammed, streams, and, stripped, the, area, of, food, this, slowed, burgoyne, s, progress, and, forced, him, to, send, out, large, foraging, expeditions, on, one, of, these, more, than, 700, british, troops, were, captured, at, the, battle, of, bennington, on, august, 16, st, leger, moved, east, and, besieged, fort, stanwix, despite, defeating, an, american, relief, force, at, the, battle, of, oriskany, on, august, 6, he, was, abandoned, by, his, indian, allies, and, withdrew, to, quebec, on, august, 22, now, isolated, and, outnumbered, by, gates, burgoyne, continued, onto, albany, rather, than, retreating, to, fort, ticonderoga, reaching, saratoga, on, september, 13, he, asked, clinton, for, support, while, constructing, defenses, around, the, town, morale, among, his, troops, rapidly, declined, and, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, break, past, gates, at, the, battle, of, freeman, farms, on, september, 19, resulted, in, 600, british, casualties, when, clinton, advised, he, could, not, reach, them, burgoyne, s, subordinates, advised, retreat, a, reconnaissance, in, force, on, october, 7, was, repulsed, by, gates, at, the, battle, of, bemis, heights, forcing, them, back, into, saratoga, with, heavy, losses, by, october, 11, all, hope, of, escape, had, vanished, persistent, rain, reduced, the, camp, to, a, squalid, hell, of, mud, and, starving, cattle, supplies, were, dangerously, low, and, many, of, the, wounded, in, agony, burgoyne, capitulated, on, october, 17, around, 6, 222, soldiers, including, german, forces, commanded, by, general, friedrich, adolf, riedesel, surrendered, their, arms, before, being, taken, to, boston, where, they, were, to, be, transported, to, england, after, securing, additional, supplies, howe, made, another, attempt, on, philadelphia, by, landing, his, troops, in, chesapeake, bay, on, august, 24, he, now, compounded, failure, to, support, burgoyne, by, missing, repeated, opportunities, to, destroy, his, opponent, defeating, washington, at, the, battle, of, brandywine, on, september, 11, then, allowing, him, to, withdraw, in, good, order, after, dispersing, an, american, detachment, at, paoli, on, september, 20, cornwallis, occupied, philadelphia, on, september, 26, with, the, main, force, of, 9, 000, under, howe, based, just, to, the, north, at, germantown, washington, attacked, them, on, october, 4, but, was, repulsed, to, prevent, howe, s, forces, in, philadelphia, being, resupplied, by, sea, the, patriots, erected, fort, mifflin, and, nearby, fort, mercer, on, the, east, and, west, banks, of, the, delaware, respectively, and, placed, obstacles, in, the, river, south, of, the, city, this, was, supported, by, a, small, flotilla, of, continental, navy, ships, on, the, delaware, supplemented, by, the, pennsylvania, state, navy, commanded, by, john, hazelwood, an, attempt, by, the, royal, navy, to, take, the, forts, in, the, october, 20, to, 22, battle, of, red, bank, failed, a, second, attack, captured, fort, mifflin, on, november, 16, while, fort, mercer, was, abandoned, two, days, later, when, cornwallis, breached, the, walls, his, supply, lines, secured, howe, tried, to, tempt, washington, into, giving, battle, but, after, inconclusive, skirmishing, at, the, battle, of, white, marsh, from, december, 5, to, 8, he, withdrew, to, philadelphia, for, the, winter, on, december, 19, the, americans, followed, suit, and, entered, winter, quarters, at, valley, forge, while, washington, s, domestic, opponents, contrasted, his, lack, of, battlefield, success, with, gates, victory, at, saratoga, foreign, observers, such, as, frederick, the, great, were, equally, impressed, with, germantown, which, demonstrated, resilience, and, determination, over, the, winter, poor, conditions, supply, problems, and, low, morale, resulted, in, 2, 000, deaths, with, another, 3, 000, unfit, for, duty, due, to, lack, of, shoes, however, baron, friedrich, wilhelm, von, steuben, took, the, opportunity, to, introduce, prussian, army, drill, and, infantry, tactics, to, the, entire, continental, army, he, did, this, by, training, model, companies, in, each, regiment, who, then, instructed, their, home, units, despite, valley, forge, being, only, twenty, miles, away, howe, made, no, effort, to, attack, their, camp, an, action, some, critics, argue, could, have, ended, the, war, like, his, predecessors, french, foreign, minister, vergennes, considered, the, 1763, peace, a, national, humiliation, and, viewed, the, war, as, an, opportunity, to, weaken, britain, he, initially, avoided, open, conflict, but, allowed, american, ships, to, take, on, cargoes, in, french, ports, a, technical, violation, of, neutrality, although, public, opinion, favored, the, american, cause, finance, minister, turgot, argued, they, did, not, need, french, help, to, gain, independence, and, war, was, too, expensive, instead, vergennes, persuaded, louis, xvi, to, secretly, fund, a, government, front, company, to, purchase, munitions, for, the, patriots, carried, in, neutral, dutch, ships, and, imported, through, sint, eustatius, in, the, caribbean, many, americans, opposed, a, french, alliance, fearing, to, exchange, one, tyranny, for, another, but, this, changed, after, a, series, of, military, setbacks, in, early, 1776, as, france, had, nothing, to, gain, from, the, colonies, reconciling, with, britain, congress, had, three, choices, making, peace, on, british, terms, continuing, the, struggle, on, their, own, or, proclaiming, independence, guaranteed, by, france, although, the, declaration, of, independence, in, july, 1776, had, wide, public, support, adams, was, among, those, reluctant, to, pay, the, price, of, an, alliance, with, france, and, over, 20, of, congressmen, voted, against, it, congress, agreed, to, the, treaty, with, reluctance, and, as, the, war, moved, in, their, favor, increasingly, lost, interest, in, it, silas, deane, was, sent, to, paris, to, begin, negotiations, with, vergennes, whose, key, objectives, were, replacing, britain, as, the, united, states, primary, commercial, and, military, partner, while, securing, the, french, west, indies, from, american, expansion, these, islands, were, extremely, valuable, in, 1772, the, value, of, sugar, and, coffee, produced, by, saint, domingue, on, its, own, exceeded, that, of, all, american, exports, combined, talks, progressed, slowly, until, october, 1777, when, british, defeat, at, saratoga, and, their, apparent, willingness, to, negotiate, peace, convinced, vergennes, only, a, permanent, alliance, could, prevent, the, disaster, of, anglo, american, rapprochement, assurances, of, formal, french, support, allowed, congress, to, reject, the, carlisle, peace, commission, and, insist, on, nothing, short, of, complete, independence, on, february, 6, 1778, france, and, the, united, states, signed, the, treaty, of, amity, and, commerce, regulating, trade, between, the, two, countries, followed, by, a, defensive, military, alliance, against, britain, the, treaty, of, alliance, in, return, for, french, guarantees, of, american, independence, congress, undertook, to, defend, their, interests, in, the, west, indies, while, both, sides, agreed, not, to, make, a, separate, peace, conflict, over, these, provisions, would, lead, to, the, 1798, to, 1800, quasi, war, charles, iii, of, spain, was, invited, to, join, on, the, same, terms, but, refused, largely, due, to, concerns, over, the, impact, of, the, revolution, on, spanish, colonies, in, the, americas, spain, had, complained, on, multiple, occasions, about, encroachment, by, american, settlers, into, louisiana, a, problem, that, could, only, get, worse, once, the, united, states, replaced, britain, although, spain, ultimately, made, important, contributions, to, american, success, in, the, treaty, of, aranjuez, charles, agreed, only, to, support, france, s, war, with, britain, outside, america, in, return, for, help, in, recovering, gibraltar, menorca, and, spanish, florida, the, terms, were, confidential, since, several, conflicted, with, american, aims, for, example, the, french, claimed, exclusive, control, of, the, newfoundland, cod, fisheries, a, non, negotiable, for, colonies, like, massachusetts, one, less, well, known, impact, of, this, agreement, was, the, abiding, american, distrust, of, foreign, entanglements, the, u, s, would, not, sign, another, treaty, with, france, until, their, nato, agreement, of, 1949, this, was, because, the, us, had, agreed, not, to, make, peace, without, france, while, aranjuez, committed, france, to, keep, fighting, until, spain, recovered, gibraltar, effectively, making, it, a, condition, of, u, s, independence, without, the, knowledge, of, congress, to, encourage, french, participation, in, the, struggle, for, independence, the, u, s, representative, in, paris, silas, deane, promised, promotion, and, command, positions, to, any, french, officer, who, joined, the, continental, army, such, as, gilbert, du, motier, marquis, de, lafayette, whom, congress, via, dean, appointed, a, major, general, on, july, 31, 1777, when, the, war, started, britain, tried, to, borrow, the, dutch, based, scots, brigade, for, service, in, america, but, pro, patriot, sentiment, led, the, states, general, to, refuse, although, the, republic, was, no, longer, a, major, power, prior, to, 1774, they, still, dominated, the, european, carrying, trade, and, dutch, merchants, made, large, profits, shipping, french, supplied, munitions, to, the, patriots, this, ended, when, britain, declared, war, in, december, 1780, a, conflict, that, proved, disastrous, to, the, dutch, economy, the, dutch, were, also, excluded, from, the, first, league, of, armed, neutrality, formed, by, russia, sweden, and, denmark, in, march, 1780, to, protect, neutral, shipping, from, being, stopped, and, searched, for, contraband, by, britain, and, france, the, british, government, failed, to, take, into, account, the, strength, of, the, american, merchant, marine, and, support, from, european, countries, which, allowed, the, colonies, to, import, munitions, and, continue, trading, with, relative, impunity, while, well, aware, of, this, the, north, administration, delayed, placing, the, royal, navy, on, a, war, footing, for, cost, reasons, this, prevented, the, institution, of, an, effective, blockade, and, restricted, them, to, ineffectual, diplomatic, protests, traditional, british, policy, was, to, employ, european, land, based, allies, to, divert, the, opposition, a, role, filled, by, prussia, in, the, seven, years, war, in, 1778, they, were, diplomatically, isolated, and, faced, war, on, multiple, fronts, meanwhile, george, iii, had, given, up, on, subduing, america, while, britain, had, a, european, war, to, fight, he, did, not, welcome, war, with, france, but, he, believed, the, british, victories, over, france, in, the, seven, years, war, as, a, reason, to, believe, in, ultimate, victory, over, france, britain, could, not, find, a, powerful, ally, among, the, great, powers, to, engage, france, on, the, european, continent, britain, subsequently, changed, its, focus, into, the, caribbean, theater, and, diverted, major, military, resources, away, from, america, vergennes, s, colleague, stated, for, her, honour, france, had, to, seize, this, opportunity, to, rise, from, her, degradation, if, she, neglected, it, if, fear, overcame, duty, she, would, add, debasement, to, humiliation, and, become, an, object, of, contempt, to, her, own, century, and, to, all, future, peoples, at, the, end, of, 1777, howe, resigned, and, was, replaced, by, sir, henry, clinton, on, may, 24, 1778, with, french, entry, into, the, war, he, was, ordered, to, consolidate, his, forces, in, new, york, on, june, 18, the, british, departed, philadelphia, with, the, reinvigorated, americans, in, pursuit, the, battle, of, monmouth, on, june, 28, was, inconclusive, but, boosted, patriot, morale, washington, had, rallied, charles, lee, s, broken, regiments, the, continentals, repulsed, british, bayonet, charges, the, british, rear, guard, lost, perhaps, 50, per, cent, more, casualties, and, the, americans, held, the, field, at, the, end, of, the, day, that, midnight, the, newly, installed, clinton, continued, his, retreat, to, new, york, a, french, naval, force, under, admiral, charles, henri, hector, d, estaing, was, sent, to, assist, washington, deciding, new, york, was, too, formidable, a, target, in, august, they, launched, a, combined, attack, on, newport, with, general, john, sullivan, commanding, land, forces, the, resulting, battle, of, rhode, island, was, indecisive, badly, damaged, by, a, storm, the, french, withdrew, to, avoid, putting, their, ships, at, risk, further, activity, was, limited, to, british, raids, on, chestnut, neck, and, little, egg, harbor, in, october, in, july, 1779, the, americans, captured, british, positions, at, stony, point, and, paulus, hook, clinton, unsuccessfully, tried, to, tempt, washington, into, a, decisive, engagement, by, sending, general, william, tryon, to, raid, connecticut, in, july, a, large, american, naval, operation, the, penobscot, expedition, attempted, to, retake, maine, then, part, of, massachusetts, but, was, defeated, persistent, iroquois, raids, in, new, york, and, pennsylvania, led, to, the, punitive, sullivan, expedition, from, july, to, september, 1779, involving, more, than, 4, 000, patriot, soldiers, the, scorched, earth, campaign, destroyed, more, than, 40, iroquois, villages, and, 160, 000, bushels, 4, 000, mts, of, maize, leaving, the, iroquois, destitute, and, destroying, the, iroquois, confederacy, as, an, independent, power, on, the, american, frontier, however, the, military, expedition, did, not, result, in, peace, 5, 000, iroquois, fled, to, canada, supplied, and, supported, by, the, british, they, continued, their, raids, during, the, winter, of, 1779, 1780, the, continental, army, suffered, greater, hardships, than, at, valley, forge, morale, was, poor, public, support, fell, away, in, the, long, war, the, continental, dollar, was, virtually, worthless, the, army, was, plagued, with, supply, problems, desertion, was, common, and, mutinies, occurred, in, the, pennsylvania, line, and, new, jersey, line, regiments, over, the, conditions, in, early, 1780, in, june, 1780, clinton, sent, 6, 000, men, under, wilhelm, von, knyphausen, to, retake, new, jersey, but, they, were, halted, by, local, militia, at, the, battle, of, connecticut, farms, although, the, americans, withdrew, knyphausen, felt, he, was, not, strong, enough, to, engage, washington, s, main, force, and, retreated, a, second, attempt, two, weeks, later, ended, in, a, british, defeat, at, the, battle, of, springfield, effectively, ending, their, ambitions, in, new, jersey, in, july, washington, appointed, benedict, arnold, commander, of, west, point, his, attempt, to, betray, the, fort, to, the, british, failed, due, to, incompetent, planning, and, the, plot, was, revealed, when, his, british, contact, john, andr, was, captured, and, later, executed, arnold, escaped, to, new, york, and, switched, sides, an, action, justified, in, a, pamphlet, addressed, to, the, inhabitants, of, america, the, patriots, condemned, his, betrayal, while, he, found, himself, almost, as, unpopular, with, the, british, the, southern, strategy, was, developed, by, lord, germain, based, on, input, from, london, based, loyalists, including, joseph, galloway, they, argued, that, it, made, no, sense, to, fight, the, patriots, in, the, north, where, they, were, strongest, while, the, new, england, economy, was, reliant, on, trade, with, britain, regardless, of, who, governed, it, on, the, other, hand, duties, on, tobacco, made, the, south, far, more, profitable, for, britain, while, local, support, meant, securing, it, required, small, numbers, of, regular, troops, victory, would, leave, a, truncated, united, states, facing, british, possessions, in, the, south, canada, to, the, north, and, ohio, on, their, western, border, with, the, atlantic, seaboard, controlled, by, the, royal, navy, congress, would, be, forced, to, agree, to, terms, however, assumptions, about, the, level, of, loyalist, support, proved, wildly, optimistic, germain, accordingly, ordered, augustine, pr, vost, the, british, commander, in, east, florida, to, advance, into, georgia, in, december, 1778, lieutenant, colonel, archibald, campbell, an, experienced, officer, taken, prisoner, earlier, in, the, war, before, being, exchanged, for, ethan, allen, captured, savannah, on, december, 29, 1778, he, recruited, a, loyalist, militia, of, nearly, 1, 100, many, of, whom, allegedly, joined, only, after, campbell, threatened, to, confiscate, their, property, poor, motivation, and, training, made, them, unreliable, troops, as, demonstrated, in, their, defeat, by, patriot, militia, at, the, battle, of, kettle, creek, on, february, 14, 1779, although, this, was,

this, cornwallis, continued, into, north, carolina, hoping, for, loyalist, support, while, washington, replaced, gates, with, general, nathanael, greene, in, december, 1780, greene, divided, his,

1778, an, expedition, of, militia, to, destroy, british, military, supplies, in, settlements, along, the, cuyahoga, river, was, halted, by, adverse, weather, later, in, the, year, a, second, campaign, was, undertaken, to, seize, the, illinois, country, from, the, british, virginia, militia, canadien, settlers, and, indian, allies, commanded, by, colonel, george, rogers, clark, captured, kaskaskia, on, july, 4, and, then, secured, vincennes, though, vincennes, was, recaptured, by, quebec, governor, henry, hamilton, in, early, 1779, the, virginians, counter, attacked, in, the, siege, of, fort,

in, the, licking, river, valley, was, extreme, even, for, frontier, standards, it, led, to, english, and, german, settlements, who, joined, clark, s, militia, when, the, british, and, their, hired, german, soldiers, withdrew, to, the, great, lakes, the, americans, responded, with, a, major, offensive, along, the, mad, river, in, august, which, met, with, some, success, in, the, battle, of,

clinton, spent, most, of, 1781, based, in, new, york, city, he, failed, to, construct, a, coherent, operational, strategy, partly, due, to, his, difficult, relationship, with, admiral, marriot, arbuthnot, in, charleston, cornwallis, independently, developed, an, aggressive, plan, for, a, campaign, in, virginia, which, he, hoped, would, isolate, greene, s, army, in, the, carolinas, and, cause, the, collapse, of, patriot, resistance, in, the, south, this, strategy, was, approved, by, lord, germain, in, london, but, neither, of, them, informed, clinton, washington, and, rochambeau, meanwhile, discussed, their, options, washington, wanted, to, attack, the, british, in, new, york, and, rochambeau, wanted, to, attack, them, in, virginia, where, cornwallis, s, forces, were, less, established, and, arguably, easier, to, defeat, washington, eventually, gave, way, and, lafayette, took, a, combined, franco, american, force, into, virginia, but, clinton, misinterpreted, his, movements, as, preparations, for, an, attack, on, new, york, concerned, by, a, perceived, threat, to, his, positions, in, new, york, he, instructed, cornwallis, to, establish, a, fortified, sea, base, where, the, royal, navy, could, evacuate, british, troops, to, help, defend, new, york, when, lafayette, entered, virginia, cornwallis, complied, with, clinton, s, orders, and, withdrew, to, yorktown, where, he, constructed, strong, defenses, and, awaited, evacuation, an, agreement, by, the, spanish, navy, to, defend, the, french, west, indies, allowed, admiral, fran, ois, joseph, paul, de, grasse, to, relocate, to, the, atlantic, seaboard, a, move, arbuthnot, did, not, anticipate, this, provided, lafayette, naval, support, while, the, failure, of, previous, combined, operations, at, newport, and, savannah, meant, their, coordination, was, planned, more, carefully, despite, repeated, urging, from, his, subordinates, cornwallis, made, no, attempt, to, engage, lafayette, before, he, could, establish, siege, lines, expecting, to, be, withdrawn, within, a, few, days, he, also, abandoned, the, outer, defenses, which, were, promptly, occupied, by, the, besiegers, and, hastened, british, defeat, on, august, 31, a, royal, navy, fleet, under, thomas, graves, left, new, york, for, yorktown, after, landing, troops, and, munitions, for, the, besiegers, on, august, 30, de, grasse, remained, in, chesapeake, bay, and, intercepted, him, on, september, 5, although, the, battle, of, the, chesapeake, was, indecisive, in, terms, of, losses, graves, was, forced, to, retreat, leaving, cornwallis, isolated, an, attempted, breakout, over, york, river, at, gloucester, point, failed, due, to, bad, weather, under, heavy, bombardment, with, dwindling, supplies, cornwallis, felt, his, situation, was, hopeless, and, on, october, 16, sent, emissaries, to, general, washington, to, negotiate, their, surrender, after, twelve, hours, of, negotiations, the, terms, of, surrender, were, finalized, the, following, day, responsibility, for, defeat, was, the, subject, of, fierce, public, debate, between, cornwallis, clinton, and, germain, despite, criticism, from, his, junior, officers, cornwallis, retained, the, confidence, of, his, peers, and, later, held, a, series, of, senior, government, positions, clinton, ultimately, took, most, of, the, blame, and, spent, the, rest, of, his, life, in, relative, obscurity, subsequent, to, yorktown, american, forces, were, assigned, to, supervise, the, armistice, between, washington, and, clinton, made, to, facilitate, british, departure, following, the, january, 1782, law, of, parliament, forbidding, any, further, british, offensive, action, in, north, america, british, american, negotiations, in, paris, led, to, signed, preliminary, agreements, in, november, 1782, which, acknowledged, u, s, independence, the, enacted, congressional, war, objective, a, british, withdrawal, from, north, america, and, cession, of, these, regions, to, the, u, s, was, completed, in, stages, in, east, coast, cities, in, the, u, s, south, generals, greene, and, wayne, loosely, invested, the, withdrawing, british, at, savannah, and, charleston, where, they, observed, the, british, remove, their, troops, from, charleston, on, december, 14, 1782, loyalist, provincial, militias, of, whites, and, free, blacks, and, loyalists, with, slaves, were, transported, to, nova, scotia, and, the, british, west, indies, native, american, allies, of, the, british, and, some, freed, blacks, were, left, to, escape, unaided, through, the, american, lines, washington, moved, his, army, to, new, windsor, on, the, hudson, river, about, sixty, miles, north, of, new, york, city, and, there, the, substance, of, the, continental, army, was, furloughed, home, with, officers, at, half, pay, until, the, treaty, of, paris, formally, ended, the, war, on, september, 3, 1783, at, that, time, congress, decommissioned, the, regiments, of, washington, s, continental, army, and, began, issuing, land, grants, to, veterans, in, the, northwest, territory, for, their, war, service, the, last, british, occupation, of, new, york, city, ended, on, november, 25, 1783, with, the, departure, of, clinton, s, replacement, general, sir, guy, carleton, to, win, their, insurrection, washington, and, the, continental, army, needed, to, outlast, the, british, will, to, continue, the, fight, to, restore, their, british, america, empire, the, british, had, to, defeat, the, continental, army, in, the, early, months, and, compel, the, second, continental, congress, in, philadelphia, to, dissolve, and, retract, its, claim, to, self, governance, historian, terry, m, mays, of, the, citadel, identifies, three, separate, types, of, warfare, during, the, revolutionary, war, the, first, was, a, colonial, conflict, in, which, objections, to, imperial, trade, regulation, were, as, significant, as, taxation, policy, the, second, was, a, civil, war, with, all, thirteen, colonies, split, between, american, patriots, american, loyalists, and, those, who, preferred, to, remain, neutral, in, the, revolution, and, war, particularly, in, the, south, many, battles, were, fought, between, patriots, and, loyalists, with, no, british, involvement, leading, to, divisions, that, continued, after, independence, was, achieved, the, third, element, was, a, global, war, between, france, spain, the, dutch, republic, and, britain, with, america, serving, as, one, of, several, different, war, theaters, after, entering, the, revolutionary, war, in, 1778, france, provided, the, americans, money, weapons, soldiers, and, naval, assistance, while, french, troops, fought, under, u, s, command, in, north, america, while, spain, did, not, formally, join, the, war, in, america, they, provided, access, to, the, mississippi, river, and, captured, british, possessions, on, the, gulf, of, mexico, that, denied, bases, to, the, royal, navy, retook, menorca, and, besieged, gibraltar, in, europe, although, the, dutch, republic, was, no, longer, a, major, power, prior, to, 1774, they, still, dominated, the, european, carrying, trade, and, dutch, merchants, made, large, profits, by, shipping, french, supplied, munitions, to, the, patriots, this, ended, when, britain, declared, war, in, december, 1780, and, the, conflict, proved, disastrous, to, the, dutch, economy, the, dutch, were, also, excluded, from, the, first, league, of, armed, neutrality, formed, by, russia, sweden, and, denmark, in, march, 1780, that, protected, neutral, ships, from, being, stopped, and, searched, for, contraband, by, britain, and, france, while, of, limited, effect, these, interventions, forced, the, british, to, divert, men, and, resources, away, from, north, america, the, second, continental, congress, meeting, in, philadelphia, stood, to, benefit, if, the, american, revolution, evolved, into, a, protracted, war, their, thirteen, colonial, state, populations, were, largely, prosperous, and, depended, on, local, production, for, food, and, supplies, rather, than, on, imports, from, britain, which, took, six, to, twelve, weeks, to, arrive, by, cross, atlantic, shipping, the, thirteen, colonies, were, spread, across, most, of, north, american, atlantic, seaboard, stretching, 1, 000, miles, most, colonial, farms, were, remote, from, the, seaports, and, control, of, four, or, five, major, ports, did, not, give, britain, control, over, american, inland, areas, each, state, had, established, internal, distribution, systems, each, of, the, thirteen, colonies, also, had, a, long, established, system, of, local, militia, which, were, combat, tested, in, support, of, british, regulars, thirteen, years, before, to, secure, an, expanded, british, empire, together, these, militias, denied, france, s, claims, to, north, america, west, of, the, mississippi, river, in, the, french, and, indian, war, the, thirteen, colonial, state, legislatures, independently, funded, and, controlled, their, local, militias, in, the, american, revolution, they, trained, and, provided, continental, line, regiments, to, the, regular, army, each, with, their, own, state, officer, corps, motivation, was, also, a, major, asset, each, colonial, capital, had, its, own, newspapers, and, printers, and, the, patriots, enjoyed, more, popular, support, than, the, loyalists, britain, hoped, that, the, loyalists, would, do, much, of, the, fighting, but, found, that, the, loyalists, did, not, engage, as, significantly, as, they, had, hoped, when, the, revolutionary, war, began, the, second, continental, congress, lacked, a, professional, army, or, navy, but, each, colony, maintained, local, militias, militiamen, were, lightly, armed, had, little, training, and, usually, did, not, have, uniforms, their, units, served, for, only, a, few, weeks, or, months, at, a, time, and, lacked, the, training, and, discipline, of, more, experienced, soldiers, local, county, militias, were, reluctant, to, travel, far, from, home, and, they, were, unavailable, for, extended, operations, to, compensate, for, this, the, continental, congress, established, a, regular, force, known, as, the, continental, army, on, june, 14, 1775, which, proved, to, be, the, origin, of, the, modern, united, states, army, and, appointed, washington, as, its, commander, in, chief, however, it, suffered, significantly, from, the, lack, of, an, effective, training, program, and, from, largely, inexperienced, officers, and, sergeants, offset, by, a, few, senior, officers, each, state, legislature, appointed, officers, for, both, county, and, state, militias, and, their, regimental, continental, line, officers, although, washington, was, required, to, accept, congressional, appointments, he, was, still, permitted, to, choose, and, command, his, own, generals, such, as, greene, his, chief, of, artillery, knox, and, alexander, hamilton, the, chief, of, staff, one, of, washington, s, most, successful, general, officer, recruits, was, steuben, a, veteran, of, the, prussian, general, staff, who, wrote, the, revolutionary, war, drill, manual, the, development, of, the, continental, army, was, always, a, work, in, progress, and, washington, used, both, his, regulars, and, state, militias, throughout, the, war, when, properly, employed, the, combination, allowed, them, to, overwhelm, smaller, british, forces, as, they, did, in, battles, at, concord, boston, bennington, and, saratoga, both, sides, used, partisan, warfare, but, the, state, militias, effectively, suppressed, loyalist, activity, when, british, regulars, were, not, in, the, area, washington, designed, the, overall, military, strategy, of, the, revolutionary, war, in, cooperation, with, congress, established, the, principle, of, civilian, supremacy, in, military, affairs, personally, recruited, his, senior, officer, corps, and, kept, the, states, focused, on, a, common, goal, for, the, first, three, years, until, after, fall, of, philadelphia, and, the, six, month, encampment, at, valley, forge, the, continental, army, was, largely, supplemented, by, local, state, militias, washington, initially, employed, the, inexperienced, officers, and, untrained, troops, in, fabian, strategies, rather, than, risk, frontal, assaults, against, britain, s, professional, soldiers, and, officers, over, the, course, of, the, entire, war, washington, lost, more, battles, than, he, won, but, he, never, surrendered, his, troops, and, maintained, a, fighting, force, in, the, face, of, british, field, armies, and, never, gave, up, fighting, for, the, american, cause, by, prevailing, european, standards, the, armies, in, america, were, relatively, small, limited, by, lack, of, supplies, and, logistics, the, british, were, constrained, by, the, logistical, difficulty, of, transporting, troops, across, the, atlantic, and, their, dependence, on, local, supplies, throughout, the, war, washington, never, directly, commanded, more, than, 17, 000, men, and, the, combined, franco, american, army, in, the, decisive, american, victory, at, yorktown, was, only, about, 19, 000, at, the, beginning, of, 1776, patriot, forces, consisted, of, 20, 000, men, with, two, thirds, of, them, in, the, continental, army, and, the, other, third, in, the, various, state, militias, about, 250, 000, american, men, served, as, regulars, or, as, militia, for, the, revolutionary, cause, over, eight, years, during, wartime, but, there, were, never, more, than, 90, 000, men, under, arms, at, any, time, on, the, whole, american, officers, never, equaled, their, british, opponents, in, tactics, and, maneuvers, and, they, lost, most, of, the, pitched, battles, the, great, successes, at, boston, 1776, saratoga, 1777, and, yorktown, 1781, were, won, by, trapping, the, british, far, from, base, with, a, greater, number, of, troops, after, 1778, however, washington, s, army, was, transformed, into, a, more, disciplined, and, effective, force, mostly, as, a, product, of, baron, von, steuben, s, military, training, immediately, after, the, continental, army, emerged, from, valley, forge, in, june, 1778, it, proved, its, ability, to, match, the, military, capabilities, of, the, british, at, the, battle, of, monmouth, including, a, black, rhode, island, regiment, fending, off, a, british, bayonet, attack, and, then, counter, charging, the, british, for, the, first, time, as, part, of, washington, s, army, after, the, battle, of, monmouth, washington, came, to, realize, that, saving, entire, towns, was, not, necessary, but, preserving, his, army, and, keeping, the, revolutionary, spirit, alive, was, more, important, washington, informed, henry, laurens, then, president, of, the, second, continental, congress, that, the, possession, of, our, towns, while, we, have, an, army, in, the, field, will, avail, them, little, although, the, continental, congress, was, responsible, for, the, war, effort, and, provided, supplies, to, the, troops, washington, took, it, upon, himself, to, pressure, congress, and, the, state, legislatures, to, provide, the, essentials, of, war, there, was, never, nearly, enough, congress, evolved, in, its, committee, oversight, and, established, the, board, of, war, which, included, members, of, the, military, because, the, board, of, war, was, also, a, committee, ensnared, with, its, own, internal, procedures, congress, also, created, the, post, of, secretary, of, war, appointing, major, general, benjamin, lincoln, to, the, position, in, february, 1781, washington, worked, closely, with, lincoln, to, coordinate, civilian, and, military, authorities, and, took, charge, of, training, and, supplying, the, army, during, the, first, summer, of, the, war, washington, began, outfitting, schooners, and, other, small, seagoing, vessels, to, prey, on, ships, supplying, the, british, in, boston, the, second, continental, congress, established, the, continental, navy, on, october, 13, 1775, and, appointed, esek, hopkins, as, its, first, commander, for, most, of, the, war, the, continental, navy, included, only, a, handful, of, small, frigates, and, sloops, supported, by, numerous, privateers, on, november, 10, 1775, congress, authorized, the, creation, of, the, continental, marines, which, ultimately, evolved, into, and, was, named, the, united, states, marine, corps, john, paul, jones, became, the, first, american, naval, hero, when, he, captured, hms, drake, on, april, 24, 1778, the, first, victory, for, any, american, military, vessel, in, british, waters, the, last, such, victory, was, by, the, frigate, uss, alliance, commanded, by, captain, john, barry, on, march, 10, 1783, the, alliance, outgunned, hms, sybil, in, a, 45, minute, duel, while, escorting, spanish, gold, from, havana, to, the, congress, in, philadelphia, after, yorktown, all, us, navy, ships, were, sold, or, given, away, it, was, the, first, time, in, america, s, history, that, it, had, no, fighting, forces, on, the, high, seas, congress, primarily, commissioned, privateers, to, reduce, costs, and, to, take, advantage, of, the, large, proportion, of, colonial, sailors, found, in, the, british, empire, in, total, they, included, 1, 700, ships, that, successfully, captured, 2,

american, privateers, during, the, war, at, the, beginning, of, the, revolutionary, war, the, americans, had, no, major, international, allies, since, most, nation, states, watched, and, waited, to, see, how, developments, unfolded, in, the, conflict, in, british, america, over, time, the, continental, army, established, its, military, credibility, defeating, or, holding, their, own, against, british, regulars, and, their, hired, hessians, known, to, all, european, great, powers, battles, such, as, the, battle, of, bennington, the, battles, of, saratoga, and, even, defeats, such, as, the, battle, of, germantown, proved, decisive, in, gaining, the, attention, and, support, of, powerful, european, nations, including, france, spain, and, the, dutch, republic, the, dutch, impressed, by, these, american, victories, and, conflicts, moved, from, covertly, supplying, the, americans, with, weapons, and, supplies, to, overtly, supporting, them, the, decisive, american, victory, at, saratoga, convinced, france, which, was, already, a, long, time, rival, of, britain, to, offer, the, americans, the, treaty, of, amity, and, commerce, the, two, nations, also, agreed, to, a, defensive, treaty, of, alliance, to, protect, their, trade, and, also, guaranteed, american, independence, from, britain, to, engage, the, united, states, as, a, french, ally, militarily, the, treaty, was, conditioned, on, britain, initiating, a, war, on, france, to, stop, it, from, trading, with, the, u, s, spain, and, the, dutch, republic, were, invited, to, join, by, both, france, and, the, united, states, in, the, treaty, but, neither, was, responsive, to, the, request, on, june, 13, 1778, france, declared, war, on, great, britain, and, it, invoked, the, french, military, alliance, with, the, u, s, which, ensured, additional, u, s, private, support, for, french, possessions, in, the, caribbean, washington, worked, closely, with, the, soldiers, and, navy, that, france, would, send, to, america, primarily, through, lafayette, on, his, staff, french, assistance, made, critical, contributions, required, to, defeat, cornwallis, at, yorktown, in, 1781, the, british, military, had, considerable, experience, of, fighting, in, north, america, most, recently, during, the, seven, years, war, which, forced, france, to, give, up, new, france, in, 1763, however, in, previous, conflicts, they, benefited, from, local, logistics, as, well, as, support, from, the, colonial, militia, which, was, not, available, in, the, american, revolutionary, war, reinforcements, had, to, come, from, europe, and, maintaining, large, armies, over, such, distances, was, extremely, complex, ships, could, take, three, months, to, cross, the, atlantic, and, orders, from, london, were, often, outdated, by, the, time, they, arrived, prior, to, the, conflict, the, colonies, were, largely, autonomous, economic, and, political, entities, with, no, centralized, area, of, ultimate, strategic, importance, this, meant, that, unlike, europe, where, the, fall, of, a, capital, city, often, ended, wars, that, in, america, continued, even, after, the, loss, of, major, settlements, such, as, philadelphia, the, seat, of, congress, new, york, and, charleston, british, power, was, reliant, on, the, royal, navy, whose, dominance, allowed, them, to, resupply, their, own, expeditionary, forces, while, preventing, access, to, enemy, ports, however, the, majority, of, the, american, population, was, agrarian, rather, than, urban, supported, by, the, french, navy, and, blockade, runners, based, in, the, dutch, caribbean, their, economy, was, able, to, survive, the, geographical, size, of, the, colonies, and, limited, manpower, meant, the, british, could, not, simultaneously, conduct, military, operations, and, occupy, territory, without, local, support, debate, persists, over, whether, their, defeat, was, inevitable, one, british, statesman, described, it, as, like, trying, to, conquer, a, map, while, ferling, argues, patriot, victory, was, nothing, short, of, a, miracle, ellis, suggests, the, odds, always, favored, the, americans, especially, after, howe, squandered, the, chance, of, a, decisive, british, success, in, 1776, an, opportunity, that, would, never, come, again, the, us, military, history, speculates, the, additional, commitment, of, 10, 000, fresh, troops, in, 1780, would, have, placed, british, victory, within, the, realm, of, possibility, the, expulsion, of, france, from, north, america, in, 1763, led, to, a, drastic, reduction, in, british, troop, levels, in, the, colonies, in, 1775, there, were, only, 8, 500, regular, soldiers, among, a, civilian, population, of, 2, 8, million, the, bulk, of, military, resources, in, the, americas, were, focused, on, defending, sugar, islands, in, the, caribbean, jamaica, alone, generated, more, revenue, than, all, thirteen, american, colonies, combined, with, the, end, of, the, seven, years, war, the, permanent, army, in, britain, was, also, cut, back, which, resulted, in, administrative, difficulties, when, the, war, began, a, decade, later, over, the, course, of, the, war, there, were, four, separate, british, commanders, in, chief, the, first, was, thomas, gage, appointed, in, 1763, whose, initial, focus, was, establishing, british, rule, in, former, french, areas, of, canada, rightly, or, wrongly, many, in, london, blamed, the, revolt, on, his, failure, to, take, firm, action, earlier, and, he, was, relieved, after, the, heavy, losses, incurred, at, the, battle, of, bunker, hill, in, charlestown, massachusetts, his, replacement, was, sir, william, howe, a, member, of, the, whig, faction, in, parliament, who, opposed, the, policy, of, coercion, advocated, by, lord, north, cornwallis, who, later, surrendered, at, yorktown, was, one, of, many, senior, officers, who, initially, refused, to, serve, in, north, america, the, 1775, campaign, showed, the, british, overestimated, the, capabilities, of, their, own, troops, and, underestimated, the, colonial, militia, requiring, a, reassessment, of, tactics, and, strategy, however, it, allowed, the, patriots, to, take, the, initiative, and, british, authorities, rapidly, lost, control, over, every, colony, howe, s, responsibility, is, still, debated, despite, receiving, large, numbers, of, reinforcements, bunker, hill, seems, to, have, permanently, affected, his, self, confidence, and, lack, of, tactical, flexibility, meant, he, often, failed, to, follow, up, opportunities, many, of, his, decisions, were, attributed, to, supply, problems, such, as, the, delay, in, launching, the, new, york, campaign, and, failure, to, pursue, washington, s, beaten, army, having, lost, the, confidence, of, his, subordinates, he, was, recalled, after, burgoyne, surrendered, at, saratoga, following, the, failure, of, the, carlisle, commission, british, policy, changed, from, treating, the, patriots, as, subjects, who, needed, to, be, reconciled, to, enemies, who, had, to, be, defeated, in, 1778, howe, was, replaced, by, sir, henry, clinton, appointed, instead, of, carleton, who, was, considered, overly, cautious, regarded, as, an, expert, on, tactics, and, strategy, like, his, predecessors, clinton, was, handicapped, by, chronic, supply, issues, as, a, result, he, was, largely, inactive, in, 1779, and, much, of, 1780, in, october, 1780, he, warned, germain, of, fatal, consequences, if, matters, did, not, improve, in, addition, clinton, s, strategy, was, compromised, by, conflict, with, political, superiors, in, london, and, his, colleagues, in, north, america, especially, admiral, mariot, arbuthnot, replaced, in, early, 1781, by, rodney, he, was, neither, notified, nor, consulted, when, germain, approved, cornwallis, s, invasion, of, the, south, in, 1781, and, delayed, sending, him, reinforcements, believing, the, bulk, of, washington, s, army, was, still, outside, new, york, city, after, the, surrender, at, yorktown, clinton, was, relieved, by, carleton, whose, major, task, was, to, oversee, the, evacuation, of, loyalists, and, british, troops, from, savannah, charleston, and, new, york, city, during, the, 18th, century, states, commonly, hired, foreign, soldiers, including, britain, during, the, seven, years, war, foreign, soldiers, comprised, 10, of, the, british, army, and, their, use, caused, little, debate, when, it, became, clear, additional, troops, were, needed, to, suppress, the, revolt, in, america, it, was, decided, to, employ, professional, german, soldiers, there, were, several, reasons, for, this, including, public, sympathy, for, the, patriot, cause, an, historical, reluctance, to, expand, the, british, army, and, the, time, needed, to, recruit, and, train, new, regiments, an, alternate, source, was, readily, available, in, the, holy, roman, empire, where, many, smaller, states, had, a, long, tradition, of, renting, their, armies, to, the, highest, bidder, the, most, important, was, hesse, kassel, known, as, the, mercenary, state, the, first, supply, agreements, were, signed, by, the, north, administration, in, late, 1775, over, the, next, decade, more, than, 40, 000, germans, fought, in, north, america, gibraltar, south, africa, and, india, of, whom, 30, 000, served, in, the, american, war, often, generically, referred, to, as, hessians, they, included, men, from, many, other, states, including, hanover, and, brunswick, sir, henry, clinton, recommended, recruiting, russian, troops, whom, he, rated, very, highly, having, seen, them, in, action, against, the, ottomans, however, negotiations, with, catherine, the, great, made, little, progress, unlike, previous, wars, their, use, led, to, intense, political, debate, in, britain, france, and, even, germany, where, frederick, the, great, refused, to, provide, passage, through, his, territories, for, troops, hired, for, the, american, war, in, march, 1776, the, agreements, were, challenged, in, parliament, by, whigs, who, objected, to, coercion, in, general, and, the, use, of, foreign, soldiers, to, subdue, british, subjects, the, debates, were, covered, in, detail, by, american, newspapers, which, reprinted, key, speeches, and, in, may, 1776, they, received, copies, of, the, treaties, themselves, provided, by, british, sympathizers, these, were, smuggled, into, north, america, from, london, by, george, merchant, a, recently, released, american, prisoner, the, prospect, of, foreign, german, soldiers, being, used, in, the, colonies, bolstered, support, for, independence, more, so, than, taxation, and, other, acts, combined, the, king, was, accused, of, declaring, war, on, his, own, subjects, leading, to, the, idea, there, were, now, two, separate, governments, by, apparently, showing, britain, was, determined, to, go, to, war, it, made, hopes, of, reconciliation, seem, naive, and, hopeless, while, the, employment, of, what, was, regarded, as, foreign, mercenaries, became, one, of, the, charges, levelled, against, george, iii, in, the, declaration, of, independence, the, hessian, reputation, within, germany, for, brutality, also, increased, support, for, the, patriot, cause, among, german, american, immigrants, the, presence, of, over, 150, 000, german, americans, meant, both, sides, felt, the, german, soldiers, might, be, persuaded, to, desert, one, reason, clinton, suggested, employing, russians, was, that, he, felt, they, were, less, likely, to, defect, when, the, first, german, troops, arrived, on, staten, island, in, august, 1776, congress, approved, the, printing, of, handbills, promising, land, and, citizenship, to, any, willing, to, join, the, patriot, cause, the, british, launched, a, counter, campaign, claiming, deserters, could, well, be, executed, for, meddling, in, a, war, that, was, not, theirs, desertion, among, the, germans, occurred, throughout, the, war, with, the, highest, rate, of, desertion, occurring, during, the, time, between, the, surrender, at, yorktown, and, the, treaty, of, paris, german, regiments, were, central, to, the, british, war, effort, of, the, estimated, 30, 000, sent, to, america, some, 13, 000, became, casualties, wealthy, loyalists, convinced, the, british, government, that, most, of, the, colonists, were, sympathetic, toward, the, crown, consequently, british, military, planners, relied, on, recruiting, loyalists, but, had, trouble, recruiting, sufficient, numbers, as, the, patriots, had, widespread, support, nevertheless, they, continued, to, deceive, themselves, on, their, level, of, american, support, as, late, as, 1780, a, year, before, hostilities, ended, approximately, 25, 000, loyalists, fought, for, the, british, throughout, the, war, although, loyalists, constituted, about, twenty, percent, of, the, colonial, population, they, were, concentrated, in, distinct, communities, many, of, them, lived, among, large, plantation, owners, in, the, tidewater, region, and, south, carolina, who, produced, cash, crops, in, tobacco, and, indigo, comparable, to, global, markets, in, caribbean, sugar, when, the, british, began, probing, the, backcountry, in, 1777, 1778, they, were, faced, with, a, major, problem, any, significant, level, of, organized, loyalist, activity, required, a, continued, presence, of, british, regulars, the, available, manpower, that, the, british, had, in, america, was, insufficient, to, protect, loyalist, territory, and, counter, american, offensives, the, loyalist, militias, in, the, south, were, constantly, defeated, by, neighboring, patriot, militia, the, most, critical, combat, between, the, two, partisan, militias, was, at, the, battle, of, kings, mountain, the, patriot, victory, irreversibly, impaired, any, further, loyalist, militia, capability, in, the, south, when, the, early, war, policy, was, administered, by, howe, the, crown, s, need, to, maintain, loyalist, support, prevented, it, from, using, the, traditional, revolt, suppression, methods, the, british, cause, suffered, when, their, troops, ransacked, local, homes, during, an, aborted, attack, on, charleston, in, 1779, that, enraged, both, patriots, and, loyalists, after, congress, rejected, the, carlisle, peace, commission, in, 1778, and, westminster, turned, to, hard, war, during, clinton, s, command, neutral, colonists, in, the, carolinas, often, allied, with, the, patriots, whenever, brutal, combat, broke, out, between, tories, and, whigs, conversely, loyalists, gained, support, when, patriots, intimidated, suspected, tories, by, destroying, property, or, tarring, and, feathering, a, loyalist, militia, unit, the, british, legion, provided, some, of, the, best, troops, in, british, service, it, received, a, commission, in, the, british, army, it, was, a, mixed, regiment, of, 250, dragoons, and, 200, infantry, supported, by, batteries, of, flying, artillery, it, was, commanded, by, tarleton, and, gained, a, fearsome, reputation, in, the, colonies, for, brutality, and, needless, slaughter, in, may, 1779, the, british, legion, was, one, of, five, regiments, that, formed, the, american, establishment, women, played, various, roles, during, the, revolutionary, war, they, often, accompanied, their, husbands, when, permitted, to, do, so, for, example, throughout, the, war, martha, washington, was, known, to, visit, and, provide, aid, to, her, husband, george, at, various, american, camps, and, frederika, charlotte, riedesel, documented, the, saratoga, campaign, women, often, accompanied, armies, as, camp, followers, to, sell, goods, and, perform, necessary, tasks, in, hospitals, and, camps, they, were, a, necessary, part, of, eighteenth, century, armies, and, numbered, in, the, thousands, during, the, war, women, also, assumed, military, roles, aside, from, military, tasks, like, treating, the, wounded, or, setting, up, camp, some, dressed, as, men, to, directly, support, combat, fight, or, act, as, spies, on, both, sides, of, the, revolutionary, war, anna, maria, lane, joined, her, husband, in, the, army, and, wore, men, s, clothes, by, the, time, the, battle, of, germantown, happened, the, virginia, general, assembly, later, cited, her, bravery, she, fought, while, dressed, as, a, man, and, performed, extraordinary, military, services, and, received, a, severe, wound, at, the, battle, of, germantown, with, the, courage, of, a, soldier, on, april, 26, 1777, sybil, ludington, is, said, to, have,

thirteen, colonies, included, an, estimated, 500, 000, slaves, predominantly, used, as, labor, on, southern, plantations, in, november, 1775, lord, dunmore, the, royal, governor, of, virginia, issued, a, proclamation, that, promised, freedom, to, any, patriot, owned, slaves, willing, to, bear, arms, although, the, announcement, helped, to, fill, a, temporary, manpower, shortage, white, loyalist, prejudice, meant, recruits, were, eventually, redirected, to, non, combatant, roles, the, loyalists, motive, was, to, deprive, patriot, planters, of, labor, rather, than, to, end, slavery, loyalist, owned, slaves, were, returned, the, 1779, philipsburg, proclamation, issued, by, clinton, extended, the, offer, of, freedom, to, patriot, owned, slaves, throughout, the, colonies, it, persuaded, entire, families, to, escape, to, british, lines, many, of, which, were, employed, on, farms, to, grow, food, for, the, army, by, removing, the, requirement, for, military, service, while, clinton, organized, the, black, pioneers, he, also, ensured, fugitive, slaves, were, returned, to, loyalist, owners, with, orders, that, they, were, not, to, be, punished, for, their, attempted, escape, as, the, war, progressed, service, as, regular, soldiers, in, british, units, became, increasingly, common, black, loyalists, formed, two, regiments, of, the, charleston, garrison, in, 1783, estimates, of, the, numbers, who, served, the, british, during, the, war, vary, from, 25, 000, to, 50, 000, excluding, those, who, escaped, during, wartime, thomas, jefferson, estimated, that, virginia, may, have, lost, 30, 000, slaves, in, total, escapes, in, south, carolina, nearly, 25, 000, slaves, about, 30, percent, of, the, enslaved, population, either, fled, migrated, or, died, which, significantly, disrupted, the, plantation, economies, both, during, and, after, the, war, black, patriots, were, barred, from, the, continental, army, until, washington, convinced, congress, in, january, 1778, that, there, was, no, other, way, to, replace, losses, from, disease, and, desertion, the, 1st, rhode, island, regiment, formed, in, february, included, former, slaves, whose, owners, were, compensated, however, only, 140, of, its, 225, soldiers, were, black, and, recruitment, stopped, in, june, 1788, ultimately, around, 5, 000, african, americans, served, in, the, continental, army, and, navy, in, a, variety, of, roles, while, another, 4, 000, were, employed, in, patriot, militia, units, aboard, privateers, or, as, teamsters, servants, and, spies, after, the, war, a, small, minority, received, land, grants, or, congressional, pensions, in, old, age, many, others, were, returned, to, their, masters, post, war, despite, earlier, promises, of, freedom, as, a, patriot, victory, became, increasingly, likely, the, treatment, of, black, loyalists, became, a, point, of, contention, after, the, surrender, of, yorktown, in, 1781, washington, insisted, all, escapees, be, returned, but, cornwallis, refused, in, 1782, and, 1783, around, 8, 000, to, 10, 000, freed, blacks, were, evacuated, by, the, british, from, charleston, savannah, and, new, york, some, moved, onto, london, while, 3, 000, to, 4, 000, settled, in, nova, scotia, where, they, founded, settlements, such, as, birchtown, white, loyalists, transported, 15, 000, enslaved, blacks, to, jamaica, and, the, bahamas, the, free, black, loyalists, who, migrated, to, the, british, west, indies, included, regular, soldiers, from, dunmore, s, ethiopian, regiment, and, those, from, charleston, who, helped, garrison, the, leeward, islands, most, native, americans, east, of, the, mississippi, river, were, affected, by, the, war, and, many, tribes, were, divided, over, how, to, respond, to, the, conflict, a, few, tribes, were, friendly, with, the, colonists, but, most, natives, opposed, the, union, of, the, colonies, as, a, potential, threat, to, their, territory, approximately, 13, 000, natives, fought, on, the, british, side, with, the, largest, group, coming, from, the, iroquois, tribes, who, deployed, around, 1, 500, men, early, in, july, 1776, cherokee, allies, of, britain, attacked, the, short, lived, washington, district, of, north, carolina, their, defeat, splintered, both, cherokee, settlements, and, people, and, was, directly, responsible, for, the, rise, of, the, chickamauga,

against, americans, in, georgia, and, south, carolina, in, 1778, a, force, of, 800, muscogee, destroyed, american, settlements, along, the, broad, river, in, georgia, muscogee, warriors, also, joined, thomas, brown, s, raids, into, south, carolina, and, assisted, britain, during, the, siege, of, savannah, many, native, americans, were, involved, in, the, fight, between, britain, and, spain, on, the, gulf, coast, and, along, the, british, side, of, the, mississippi, river, thousands, of, muscogee, chickasaw, and, choctaw, fought, in, major, battles, such, as, the, battle, of, fort, charlotte, the, battle, of, mobile, and, the, siege, of, pensacola, the, iroquois, confederacy, was, shattered, as, a, result, of, the, american, revolutionary, war, whatever, side, they, took, the, seneca,

debilitate, the, iroquois, tribes, that, had, sided, with, the, british, mohawk, leaders, joseph, louis, cook, and, joseph, brant, sided, with, the, americans, and, the, british, respectively, which, further, exacerbated, the, split, in, the, western, theater, of, the, american, revolutionary, war, conflicts, between, settlers, and, native, americans, led, to, lingering, distrust, in, the, 1783, treaty, of, paris, great, britain, ceded, control, of, the, disputed, lands, between, the, great, lakes, and, the, ohio, river, but, the, indian, inhabitants, were, not, a, part, of, the, peace,

of, sandwich, who, was, head, of, the, royal, navy, from, 1771, to, 1782, defeat, at, saratoga, in, 1777, made, it, clear, the, revolt, would, not, be, easily, suppressed, especially, after, the, franco, american, alliance, of, february, 1778, and, french, declaration, of, war, in, june, with, spain, also, expected, to, join, the, conflict, the, royal, navy, needed, to, prioritize, either, the, war, in, america, or, in, europe, germain, advocated, the, former, sandwich, the, latter, british, negotiators, now, proposed, a, second, peace, settlement, to, congress, the, terms, presented, by, the, carlisle, peace, commission, included, acceptance, of, the, principle, of, self, government, parliament, would, recognize, congress, as, the, governing, body, suspend, any, objectionable, legislation, surrender, its, right, to, local, colonial, taxation, and, discuss, including, american, representatives, in, the, house, of, commons, in, return, all, property, confiscated, from, loyalists, would, be, returned, british, debts, honored, and, locally, enforced, martial, law, accepted, however, congress, demanded, either, immediate, recognition, of, independence, or, the, withdrawal, of, all, british, troops, they, knew, the, commission, were, not, authorized, to, accept, these, bringing, negotiations, to, a, rapid, end, when, the, commissioners, returned, to, london, in, november, 1778, they, recommended, a, change, in, policy, sir, henry, clinton, the, new, british, commander, in, chief, in, america, was, ordered, to, stop, treating, the, rebels, as, enemies, rather, than, subjects, whose, loyalty, might, be, regained, those, standing, orders, would, be, in, effect, for, three, years, until, clinton, was, relieved, north, initially, backed, the, southern, strategy, attempting, to, exploit, divisions, between, the, mercantile, north, and, slave, owning, south, but, after, the, defeat, of, yorktown, he, was, forced, to, accept, the, fact, that, this, policy, had, failed, it, was, clear, the, war, was, lost, although, the, royal, navy, forced, the, french, to, relocate, their, fleet, to, the, caribbean, in, november, 1781, and, resumed, a, close,

british, strategy, was, to, strengthen, the, u, s, sufficiently, to, prevent, france, from, regaining, a, foothold, in, north, america, and, they, had, little, interest, in, these, proposals, however, divisions, between, their, opponents, allowed, them, to, negotiate, separately, with, each, to, improve, their, overall, position, starting, with, the, american, delegation, in, september, 1782, the,

who, helped, draft, the, treaty, claimed, it, represented, one, of, the, most, important, political, events, that, ever, happened, on, the, globe, ratified, respectively, by, congress, and, parliament, the, final, versions, were, exchanged, in, paris, the, following, spring, on, november, 25, the, last, british, troops, remaining, in, the, u, s, were, evacuated, from, new, york, to,

miracle, the, conflict, between, british, subjects, with, the, crown, against, those, with, the, congress, had, lasted, over, eight, years, from, 1775, to, 1783, the, last, uniformed, british, troops,

states, on, april, 9, 1783, washington, issued, orders, that, he, had, long, waited, to, give, that, all, acts, of, hostility, were, to, cease, immediately, that, same, day, by, arrangement, with, washington, carleton, issued, a, similar, order, to, british, troops, british, troops, however, were, not, to, evacuate, until, a, prisoner, of, war, exchange, occurred, an, effort, that, involved, much, negotiation, and, would, take, some, seven, months, to, effect, as, directed, by, a, congressional, resolution, of, may, 26, 1783, all, non, commissioned, officers, and, enlisted, were, furloughed, to, their, homes, until, the, definitive, treaty, of, peace, when, they, would, be, automatically, discharged, the, u, s, armies, were, directly, disbanded, in, the, field, as, of, washington, s, general, orders, on, monday, june, 2, 1783, once, the, treaty, of, paris, was, signed, with, britain, on, september, 3, 1783, washington, resigned, as, commander, in, chief, of, the, continental, army, and, left, to, retire, at, mount, vernon, the, expanse, of, territory, that, was, now, the, u, s, was, ceded, from, its, colonial, mother, country, alone, it, included, millions, of, sparsely, settled, acres, south, of, the, great, lakes, line, between, the, appalachian, mountains, and, the, mississippi, river, much, of, which, was, part, of, canada, the, tentative, colonial, migration, west, became, a, flood, during, the, years, of, the, revolutionary, war, kentucky, county, virginia, for, instance, had, a, 1775, population, of, 150, by, 1790, 15, years, later, its, population, had, grown, to, over, 73, 000, britain, s, extended, post, war, policy, for, the, u, s, continued, to, try, to, establish, an, indian, barrier, state, below, the, great, lakes, as, late, as, 1814, during, the, war, of, 1812, the, formally, acquired, western, american, lands, continued, to, be, populated, by, a, dozen, or, so, american, indian, tribes, that, had, been, british, allies, for, the, most, part, though, british, forts, on, their, lands, had, been, ceded, to, either, the, french, or, the, british, prior, to, the, creation, of, the, u, s, natives, were, not, referred, to, in, the, british, cession, to, the, u, s, while, tribes, were, not, consulted, by, the, british, for, the, treaty, in, practice, the, british, refused, to, abandon, the, forts, on, territory, they, formally, transferred, instead, they, provisioned, military, allies, for, continuing, frontier, raids, and, sponsored, the, northwest, indian, war, 1785, 1795, including, erecting, an, additional, british, fort, miami, in, maumee, ohio, british, sponsorship, of, local, warfare, on, the, u, s, continued, until, the, anglo, american, jay, treaty, authored, by, hamilton, went, into, effect, on, february, 29, 1796, at, the, same, time, the, spanish, also, sponsored, war, within, the, u, s, by, indian, proxies, in, its, southwest, territory, ceded, by, france, to, britain, then, britain, to, the, americans, of, the, european, powers, with, american, colonies, adjacent, to, the, newly, created, u, s, spain, was, most, threatened, by, american, independence, and, it, was, correspondingly, the, most, hostile, to, it, its, territory, adjacent, to, the, u, s, was, relatively, undefended, so, spanish, policy, developed, a, combination, of, initiatives, spanish, soft, power, diplomatically, challenged, the, british, territorial, cession, west, to, the, mississippi, river, and, the, previous, northern, boundaries, of, spanish, florida, it, imposed, a, high, tariff, on, american, goods, then, blocked, american, settler, access, to, the, port, of, new, orleans, spanish, hard, power, extended, war, alliances, and, arms, to, southwestern, natives, to, resist, american, settlement, a, former, continental, army, general, james, wilkinson, settled, in, kentucky, county, virginia, in, 1784, and, there, he, fostered, settler, secession, from, virginia, during, the, conflict, with, the, spanish, allied, chickamauga, cherokee, beginning, in, 1787, he, received, pay, as, spanish, agent, 13, and, subsequently, expanded, his, efforts, to, persuade, american, settlers, west, of, the, appalachian, mountains, to, secede, from, the, united, states, first, in, the, washington, administration, and, later, again, in, the, jefferson, administration, the, total, loss, of, life, throughout, the, conflict, is, largely, unknown, as, was, typical, in, wars, of, the, era, diseases, such, as, smallpox, claimed, more, lives, than, battle, between, 1775, and, 1782, a, smallpox, epidemic, broke, out, throughout, north, america, killing, an, estimated, 130, 000, among, all, its, populations, during, those, years, historian, joseph, ellis, suggests, that, washington, s, decision, to, have, his, troops, inoculated, against, the, disease, was, one, of, his, most, important, decisions, up, to, 70, 000, american, patriots, died, during, active, military, service, of, these, approximately, 6, 800, were, killed, in, battle, while, at, least, 17, 000, died, from, disease, the, majority, of, the, latter, died, while, prisoners, of, war, of, the, british, mostly, in, the, prison, ships, in, new, york, harbor, the, number, of, patriots, seriously, wounded, or, disabled, by, the, war, has, been, estimated, from, 8, 500, to, 25, 000, the, french, suffered, 2, 112, killed, in, combat, in, the, united, states, the, spanish, lost, a, total, of, 124, killed, and, 247, wounded, in, west, florida, a, british, report, in, 1781, puts, their, total, army, deaths, at, 6, 046, in, north, america, 1775, 1779, approximately, 7, 774, germans, died, in, british, service, in, addition, to, 4, 888, deserters, among, those, labeled, german, deserters, however, it, is, estimated, that, 1, 800, were, killed, in, combat, the, american, revolution, established, the, united, states, with, its, numerous, civil, liberties, and, set, an, example, to, overthrow, both, monarchy, and, colonial, governments, the, united, states, has, the, world, s, oldest, written, constitution, and, the, constitutions, of, other, free, countries, often, bear, a, striking, resemblance, to, the, u, s, constitution, often, word, for, word, in, places, it, inspired, revolutions, in, france, haiti, latin, america, and, elsewhere, in, the, modern, era, although, the, revolution, eliminated, many, forms, of, inequality, it, did, little, to, change, the, status, of, women, despite, the, role, they, played, in, winning, independence, most, significantly, it, failed, to, end, slavery, which, continued, to, be, a, serious, social, and, political, issue, and, caused, divisions, that, would, ultimately, end, in, civil, war, while, many, were, uneasy, over, the, contradiction, of, demanding, liberty, for, some, yet, denying, it, to, others, the, dependence, of, southern, states, on, slave, labor, made, abolition, too, great, a, challenge, between, 1774, and, 1780, many, of, the, states, banned, the, importation, of, slaves, but, the, institution, itself, continued, in, 1782, virginia, passed, a, law, permitting, manumission, and, over, the, next, eight, years, more, than, 10, 000, slaves, were, given, their, freedom, with, support, from, benjamin, franklin, in, 1790, the, quakers, petitioned, congress, to, abolish, slavery, the, number, of, abolitionist, movements, greatly, increased, and, by, 1804, all, the, northern, states, had, outlawed, it, however, even, many, like, adams, who, viewed, slavery, as, a, foul, contagion, opposed, the, 1790, petition, as, a, threat, to, the, union, in, 1808, jefferson, passed, legislation, banning, the, importation, of, slaves, but, allowed, the, domestic, slave, trade, to, continue, arguing, the, federal, government, had, no, right, to, regulate, individual, states, the, body, of, historical, writings, on, the, american, revolution, cite, many, motivations, for, the, patriot, revolt, that, ultimately, led, to, the, nation, s, independence, and, establishment, american, patriots, stressed, the, denial, of, their, constitutional, rights, as, englishmen, especially, no, taxation, without, representation, contemporaries, credit, the, american, enlightenment, with, laying, the, intellectual, moral, and, ethical, foundations, for, the, american, revolution, among, the, founding, fathers, who, were, influenced, by, the, classical, liberalism, of, john, locke, and, other, enlightenment, age, writers, and, philosophers, two, treatises, of, government, has, long, been, cited, as, a, major, influence, on, revolutionary, era, american, thinking, but, historians, david, lundberg, and, henry, f, may, contend, that, locke, s, essay, concerning, human, understanding, was, far, more, widely, read, than, were, his, political, treatises, historians, since, the, 1960s, have, emphasized, that, the, patriot, constitutional, argument, was, made, possible, by, the, emergence, of, a, sense, of, american, nationalism, that, united, the, thirteen, colonies, in, turn, that, nationalism, was, rooted, in, a, republican, value, system, that, demanded, consent, of, the, governed, and, deeply, opposed, aristocratic, control, in, britain, on, the, other, hand, republicanism, was, largely, a, fringe, ideology, since, it, challenged, the, aristocratic, control, of, the, british, monarchy, and, political, system, political, power, was, not, controlled, by, an, aristocracy, or, nobility, in, the, 13, colonies, instead, the, colonial, political, system, was, based, on, the, winners, of, free, elections, which, were, open, at, the, time, to, the, majority, of, white, men, in, analysis, of, the, revolution, historians, in, recent, decades, have, often, cited, three, motivations, behind, it, after, the, first, u, s, postage, stamp, was, issued, in, 1849, the, u, s, postal, service, frequently, issued, commemorative, stamps, celebrating, the, various, people, and,
