that, the, axumites, destroyed, the, kingdom, of, kush, others, note, that, archeological, evidence, points, to, an, economic, and, political, decline, in, mero, around, 300, jewish, oral, tradition, avers, that, moses, in, his, younger, years, had, led, an, egyptian, military, expedition, into, sudan, kush, as, far, as, the, city, of, mero, which, was, then, called, saba, the, city, was, built, near, the, confluence, of, two, great, rivers, and, was, encircled, by, a, formidable, wall, and, governed, by, a, renegade, king, to, ensure, the, safety, of, his, men, who, traversed, that, desert, country, moses, had, invented, a, stratagem, whereby, the, egyptian, army, would, carry, along, with, them, baskets, of, sedge, each, containing, an, ibis, only, to, be, released, when, they, approached, the, enemy, s, country, the, purpose, of, the, birds, was, to, kill, the, deadly, serpents, that, lay, all, about, that, country, having, successfully, laid, siege, to, the, city, the, city, was, eventually, subdued, by, the, betrayal, of, the, king, s, daughter, who, had, agreed, to, deliver, the, city, to, moses, on, condition, that, he, would, consummate, a, marriage, with, her, under, the, solemn, assurance, of, an, oath, mero, was, the, base, of, a, flourishing, kingdom, whose, wealth, was, centered, around, a, strong, iron, industry, metalworking, is, believed, to, have, taken, place, in, mero, possibly, through, bloomeries, and, blast, furnaces, archibald, sayce, reportedly, referred, to, it, as, the, birmingham, of, africa, because, of, perceived, vast, production, and, trade, of, iron, a, contention, that, is, a, matter, of, debate, in, modern, scholarship, the, centralized, control, of, production, within, the, meroitic, empire, and, distribution, of, certain, crafts, and, manufactures, may, have, been, politically, important, with, their, iron, industry, and, pottery, crafts, gaining, the, most, significant, attention, the, meroitic, settlements, were, oriented, in, a, savannah, orientation, with, the, varying, of, permanent, and, less, permanent, agricultural, settlements, can, be, attributed, to, the, exploitation, of, rainlands, and, savannah, oriented, forms, of, subsistence, at, the, time, iron, was, one, of, the, most, important, metals, worldwide, and, meroitic, metalworkers, were, among, the, best, in, the, world, mero, traded, ivory, slaves, rare, skins, ostrich, feathers, copper, and, ebony, mero, also, exported, textiles, and, jewelry, their, textiles, were, based, on, cotton, and, working, on, this, product, reached, its, highest, achievement, in, nubia, around, 400, bc, furthermore, nubia, was, very, rich, in, gold, it, is, possible, that, the, egyptian, word, for, gold, nub, was, the, source, of, name, of, nubia, trade, in, exotic, animals, from, farther, south, in, africa, was, another, feature, of, their, economy, apart, from, the, iron, trade, pottery, was, a, widespread, and, prominent, industry, in, the, mero, kingdom, the, production, of, fine, and, elaborately, decorated, wares, was, a, strong, tradition, within, the, middle, nile, such, productions, carried, considerable, social, significance, and, are, believed, to, be, involved, in, mortuary, rites, the, long, history, of, goods, imported, into, the, meroitic, empire, and, their, subsequent, distribution, provides, insight, into, the, social, and, political, workings, of, the, meroitic, state, the, major, determinant, of, production, was, attributed, to, the, availability, of, labor, rather, than, the, political, power, associated, with, land, power, was, associated, with, control, of, people, rather, than, control, of, territory, the, sakia, was, used, to, move, water, in, conjunction, with, irrigation, to, increase, crop, production, at, its, peak, the, rulers, of, mero, controlled, the, nile, valley, north, to, south, over, a, straight, line, distance, of, more, than, 1, 000, km, 620, mi, the, king, of, mero, was, an, autocratic, ruler, who, shared, his, authority, only, with, the, queen, mother, or, candace, however, the, role, of, the, queen, mother, remains, obscure, the, administration, consisted, of, treasurers, seal, bearers, heads, of, archives, and, chief, scribes, among, others, although, the, people, of, mero, also, had, southern, deities, such, as, apedemak, the, lion, son, of, sekhmet, or, bast, depending, upon, the, region, they, also, continued, worshipping, ancient, egyptian, gods, that, they, had, brought, with, them, among, these, deities, were, amun, tefnut, horus, isis, thoth, and, satis, though, to, a, lesser, extent, the, collapse, of, their, external, trade, with, other, nile, valley, states, may, be, considered, one, of, the, prime, causes, of, the, decline, of, royal, power, and, disintegration, of, the, meroitic, state, in, the, 3rd, and, 4th, centuries, ad, the, meroitic, language, was, spoken, in, mero, and, the, sudan, during, the, meroitic, period, attested, from, 300, bc, it, became, extinct, around, 400, ad, the, language, was, written, in, two, forms, of, the, meroitic, alphabet, meroitic, cursive, which, was, written, with, a, stylus, and, was, used, for, general, record, keeping, and, meroitic, hieroglyphic, which, was, carved, in, stone, or, used, for, royal, or, religious, documents, it, is, not, well, understood, due, to, the, scarcity, of, bilingual, texts, the, earliest, inscription, in, meroitic, writing, dates, from, between, 180, and, 170, bc, these, hieroglyphics, were, found, engraved, on, the, temple, of, queen, shanakdakhete, meroitic, cursive, is, written, horizontally, and, reads, from, right, to, left, like, all, semitic, orthographies, by, the, 3rd, century, bc, a, new, indigenous, alphabet, the, meroitic, consisting, of, twenty, three, letters, replaced, egyptian, script, the, meroitic, script, is, an, alphabetic, script, originally, derived, from, egyptian, hieroglyphs, used, to, write, the, meroitic, language, of, the, kingdom, of, kush, it, was, developed, in, the, napatan, period, c, 700, 300, bc, and, first, appears, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, for, a, time, it, was, also, possibly, used, to, write, the, nubian, language, of, the, successor, nubian, kingdoms, it, is, uncertain, to, which, language, family, the, meroitic, language, is, related, kirsty, rowan, suggests, that, meroitic, like, the, egyptian, language, belongs, to, the, afro, asiatic, family, she, bases, this, on, its, sound, inventory, and, phonotactics, which, she, proposes, are, similar, to, those, of, the, afro, asiatic, languages, and, dissimilar, from, those, of, the, nilo, saharan, languages, claude, rilly, based, on, its, syntax, morphology, and, known, vocabulary, proposes, that, meroitic, like, the, nobiin, language, instead, belongs, to, the, eastern, sudanic, branch, of, the, nilo, saharan, family, the, site, of, mero, was, brought, to, the, knowledge, of, europeans, in, 1821, by, the, french, mineralogist, fr, d, ric, cailliaud, 1787, 1869, who, published, an, illustrated, in, folio, describing, the, ruins, his, work, included, the, first, publication, of, the, southernmost, known, latin, inscription, as, margoliouth, notes, in, the, 1911, encyclopedia, britannica, small, scale, excavations, occurred, in, 1834, led, by, giuseppe, ferlini, who, as, margoliouth, states, discovered, or, professed, to, discover, various, antiquities, chiefly, in, the, form, of, jewelry, now, in, the, museums, of, berlin, and, munich, margoliouth, continues, the, ruins, were, examined, in, 1844, by, c, r, lepsius, who, brought, many, plans, sketches, and, copies, besides, actual, antiquities, to, berlin, further, excavations, were, carried, on, by, e, a, wallis, budge, in, the, years, 1902, and, 1905, the, results, of, which, are, recorded, in, his, work, the, egyptian, sudan, its, history, and, monuments, troops, were, furnished, by, sir, reginald, wingate, governor, of, the, sudan, who, made, paths, to, and, between, the, pyramids, and, sank, shafts, c, it, was, found, that, the, pyramids, were, regularly, built, over, sepulchral, chambers, containing, the, remains, of, bodies, either, burned, or, buried, without, being, mummified, the, most, interesting, objects, found, were, the, reliefs, on, the, chapel, walls, already, described, by, lepsius, and, containing, the, names, with, representations, of, queens, and, some, kings, with, some, chapters, of, the, book, of, the, dead, some, steles, with, inscriptions, in, the, meroitic, language, and, some, vessels, of, metal, and, earthenware, the, best, of, the, reliefs, were, taken, down, stone, by, stone, in, 1905, and, set, up, partly, in, the, british, museum, and, partly, in, the, museum, at, khartoum, in, 1910, in, consequence, of, a, report, by, professor, archibald, sayce, excavations, were, commenced, in, the, mounds, of, the, town, and, the, necropolis, by, j, garstang, on, behalf, of, the, university, of,
