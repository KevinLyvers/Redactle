the, almoravid, dynasty, arabic, romanized, al, mur, bi, n, lit, those, from, the, ribats, was, a, berber, muslim, dynasty, centered, in, the, territory, of, present, day, morocco, it, established, an, empire, that, stretched, over, the, western, maghreb, and, al, andalus, starting, in, the, 1050s, and, lasting, until, its, fall, to, the, almohads, in, 1147, the, almoravids, emerged, from, a, coalition, of, the, lamtuna, gudala, and, massufa, nomadic, berber, tribes, living, in, what, is, now, mauritania, and, the, western, sahara, traversing, the, territory, between, the, draa, the, niger, and, the, senegal, rivers, during, their, expansion, into, the, maghreb, they, founded, the, city, of, marrakesh, as, a, capital, c, 1070, shortly, after, this, the, empire, was, divided, into, two, branches, a, northern, one, centered, in, the, maghreb, led, by, yusuf, ibn, tashfin, and, his, descendants, and, a, southern, one, based, in, the, sahara, led, by, abu, bakr, ibn, umar, and, his, descendants, the, almoravids, expanded, their, control, to, al, andalus, the, muslim, territories, in, iberia, and, were, crucial, in, temporarily, halting, the, advance, of, the, christian, kingdoms, in, this, region, with, the, battle, of, sagrajas, in, 1086, among, their, signature, victories, this, united, the, maghreb, and, al, andalus, politically, for, the, first, time, and, transformed, the, almoravids, into, the, first, major, berber, led, islamic, empire, in, the, western, mediterranean, their, rulers, never, claimed, the, title, of, caliph, and, instead, took, on, the, title, of, amir, al, muslim, n, prince, of, the, muslims, while, formally, acknowledging, the, overlordship, of, the, abbasid, caliphs, in, baghdad, the, almoravid, period, also, contributed, significantly, to, the, islamization, of, the, sahara, region, and, to, the, urbanization, of, the, western, maghreb, while, cultural, developments, were, spurred, by, increased, contact, between, al, andalus, and, africa, after, a, short, apogee, almoravid, power, in, al, andalus, began, to, decline, after, the, loss, of, zaragoza, in, 1118, the, final, cause, of, their, downfall, was, the, masmuda, led, almohad, rebellion, initiated, in, the, maghreb, by, ibn, tumart, in, the, 1120s, the, last, almoravid, ruler, ishaq, ibn, ali, was, killed, when, the, almohads, captured, marrakesh, in, 1147, and, established, themselves, as, the, new, dominant, power, in, both, north, africa, and, al, andalus, the, term, almoravid, comes, from, the, arabic, al, murabit, through, the, spanish, almor, vide, the, transformation, of, the, b, in, al, murabit, to, the, v, in, almor, vide, is, an, example, of, betacism, in, spanish, in, arabic, al, murabit, literally, means, one, who, is, tying, but, figuratively, means, one, who, is, ready, for, battle, at, a, fortress, the, term, is, related, to, the, notion, of, ribat, a, north, african, frontier, monastery, fortress, through, the, root, r, b, t, rabat, to, tie, to, unite, or, raabat, to, encamp, the, name, almoravid, was, tied, to, a, school, of, malikite, law, called, dar, al, murabitin, founded, in, sus, al, aksa, modern, day, morocco, by, a, scholar, named, waggag, ibn, zallu, ibn, zallu, sent, his, student, abdallah, ibn, yasin, to, preach, malikite, islam, to, the, sanhaja, berbers, of, the, adrar, present, day, mauritania, hence, the, name, of, the, almoravids, comes, from, the, followers, of, the, dar, al, murabitin, the, house, of, those, who, were, bound, together, in, the, cause, of, god, it, is, uncertain, exactly, when, or, why, the, almoravids, acquired, that, appellation, al, bakri, writing, in, 1068, before, their, apex, already, calls, them, the, al, murabitun, but, does, not, clarify, the, reasons, for, it, writing, three, centuries, later, ibn, abi, zar, suggested, it, was, chosen, early, on, by, abdallah, ibn, yasin, because, upon, finding, resistance, among, the, gudala, berbers, of, adrar, mauritania, to, his, teaching, he, took, a, handful, of, followers, to, erect, a, makeshift, ribat, monastery, fortress, on, an, offshore, island, possibly, tidra, island, in, the, bay, of, arguin, ibn, idhari, wrote, that, the, name, was, suggested, by, ibn, yasin, in, the, persevering, in, the, fight, sense, to, boost, morale, after, a, particularly, hard, fought, battle, in, the, draa, valley, c, 1054, in, which, they, had, taken, many, losses, whichever, explanation, is, true, it, seems, certain, the, appellation, was, chosen, by, the, almoravids, for, themselves, partly, with, the, conscious, goal, of, forestalling, any, tribal, or, ethnic, identifications, the, name, might, be, related, to, the, ribat, of, waggag, ibn, zallu, in, the, village, of, aglu, near, present, day, tiznit, where, the, future, almoravid, spiritual, leader, abdallah, ibn, yasin, got, his, initial, training, the, 13th, century, moroccan, biographer, ibn, al, zayyat, al, tadili, and, qadi, ayyad, before, him, in, the, 12th, century, note, that, waggag, s, learning, center, was, called, dar, al, murabitin, the, house, of, the, almoravids, and, that, might, have, inspired, ibn, yasin, s, choice, of, name, for, the, movement, the, almoravids, sometimes, called, al, mulathamun, the, veiled, ones, from, litham, arabic, for, veil, trace, their, origins, back, to, several, saharan, sanhaja, nomadic, tribes, dwelling, in, an, area, that, stretches, between, the, senegal, river, in, the, south, and, the, draa, river, in, the, north, the, first, and, main, almoravid, founding, tribe, was, the, lamtuna, it, occupied, the, region, around, awdaghust, aoudaghost, in, the, southern, sahara, according, to, contemporary, arab, chroniclers, such, as, al, ya, qubi, al, bakri, and, ibn, hawqal, according, to, french, historian, charles, andr, julien, the, original, cell, of, the, almoravid, empire, was, a, powerful, sanhaja, tribe, of, the, sahara, the, lamtuna, whose, place, of, origin, was, in, the, adrar, in, mauritania, the, tuareg, people, are, believed, to, be, their, descendants, these, nomads, had, been, converted, to, islam, in, the, 9th, century, they, were, subsequently, united, in, the, 10th, century, and, with, the, zeal, of, new, converts, launched, several, campaigns, against, the, sudanese, pagan, peoples, of, sub, saharan, africa, under, their, king, tinbarutan, ibn, usfayshar, the, sanhaja, lamtuna, erected, or, captured, the, citadel, of, awdaghust, a, critical, stop, on, the, trans, saharan, trade, route, after, the, collapse, of, the, sanhaja, union, awdaghust, passed, over, to, the, ghana, empire, and, the, trans, saharan, routes, were, taken, over, by, the, zenata, maghrawa, of, sijilmasa, the, maghrawa, also, exploited, this, disunion, to, dislodge, the, sanhaja, gazzula, and, lamta, out, of, their, pasturelands, in, the, sous, and, draa, valleys, around, 1035, the, lamtuna, chieftain, abu, abdallah, muhammad, ibn, tifat, alias, tarsina, tried, to, reunite, the, sanhaja, desert, tribes, but, his, reign, lasted, less, than, three, years, around, 1040, yahya, ibn, ibrahim, a, chieftain, of, the, gudala, and, brother, in, law, of, the, late, tarsina, went, on, pilgrimage, to, mecca, on, his, return, he, stopped, by, kairouan, in, ifriqiya, where, he, met, abu, imran, al, fasi, a, native, of, fez, and, a, jurist, and, scholar, of, the, sunni, maliki, school, at, this, time, ifriqiya, was, in, ferment, the, zirid, ruler, al, mu, izz, ibn, badis, was, openly, contemplating, breaking, with, his, shi, ite, fatimid, overlords, in, cairo, and, the, jurists, of, kairouan, were, agitating, for, him, to, do, so, within, this, heady, atmosphere, yahya, and, abu, imran, fell, into, conversation, on, the, state, of, the, faith, in, their, western, homelands, and, yahya, expressed, his, disappointment, at, the, lack, of, religious, education, and, negligence, of, islamic, law, among, his, southern, sanhaja, people, with, abu, imran, s, recommendation, yahya, ibn, ibrahim, made, his, way, to, the, ribat, of, waggag, ibn, zelu, in, the, sous, valley, of, southern, morocco, to, seek, out, a, maliki, teacher, for, his, people, waggag, assigned, him, one, of, his, residents, abdallah, ibn, yasin, 122, abdallah, ibn, yasin, was, a, gazzula, berber, and, probably, a, convert, rather, than, a, born, muslim, his, name, can, be, read, as, son, of, ya, sin, the, title, of, the, 36th, surah, of, the, quran, suggesting, he, had, obliterated, his, family, past, and, was, re, born, of, the, holy, book, ibn, yasin, certainly, had, the, ardor, of, a, puritan, zealot, his, creed, was, mainly, characterized, by, a, rigid, formalism, and, a, strict, adherence, to, the, dictates, of, the, quran, and, the, orthodox, tradition, chroniclers, such, as, al, bakri, allege, ibn, yasin, s, learning, was, superficial, ibn, yasin, s, initial, meetings, with, the, guddala, people, went, poorly, as, he, had, more, ardor, than, depth, ibn, yasin, s, arguments, were, disputed, by, his, audience, he, responded, to, questioning, with, charges, of, apostasy, and, handed, out, harsh, punishments, for, the, slightest, deviations, the, guddala, soon, had, enough, and, expelled, him, almost, immediately, after, the, death, of, his, protector, yahya, ibn, ibrahim, sometime, in, the, 1040s, ibn, yasin, however, found, a, more, favorable, reception, among, the, neighboring, lamtuna, people, probably, sensing, the, useful, organizing, power, of, ibn, yasin, s, pious, fervor, the, lamtuna, chieftain, yahya, ibn, umar, al, lamtuni, invited, the, man, to, preach, to, his, people, the, lamtuna, leaders, however, kept, ibn, yasin, on, a, careful, leash, forging, a, more, productive, partnership, between, them, invoking, stories, of, the, early, life, of, muhammad, ibn, yasin, preached, that, conquest, was, a, necessary, addendum, to, islamicization, that, it, was, not, enough, to, merely, adhere, to, god, s, law, but, necessary, to, also, destroy, opposition, to, it, in, ibn, yasin, s, ideology, anything, and, everything, outside, of, islamic, law, could, be, characterized, as, opposition, he, identified, tribalism, in, particular, as, an, obstacle, he, believed, it, was, not, enough, to, urge, his, audiences, to, put, aside, their, blood, loyalties, and, ethnic, differences, and, embrace, the, equality, of, all, muslims, under, the, sacred, law, it, was, necessary, to, make, them, do, so, for, the, lamtuna, leadership, this, new, ideology, dovetailed, with, their, long, desire, to, refound, the, sanhaja, union, and, recover, their, lost, dominions, in, the, early, 1050s, the, lamtuna, under, the, joint, leadership, of, yahya, ibn, umar, and, abdallah, ibn, yasin, soon, calling, themselves, the, al, murabitin, almoravids, set, out, on, a, campaign, to, bring, their, neighbors, over, to, their, cause, 123, in, the, early, 1050s, a, kind, of, triumvirate, emerged, in, leading, the, almoravid, movement, including, abdallah, ibn, yasin, yahya, ibn, umar, and, his, brother, abu, bakr, ibn, umar, the, movement, was, now, dominated, by, the, lamtuna, rather, than, the, guddala, during, the, 1050s, the, almoravids, began, their, expansion, and, their, conquest, of, the, saharan, tribes, their, first, major, targets, were, two, strategic, cities, located, at, the, northern, and, southern, edges, of, the, desert, sijilmasa, in, the, north, and, awdaghust, in, the, south, control, of, these, two, cities, would, allow, the, almoravids, to, effectively, control, the, trans, saharan, trade, routes, sijilmasa, was, controlled, by, the, maghrawa, a, part, of, the, northern, zenata, berber, confederation, while, awdaghust, was, controlled, by, the, soninke, both, cities, were, captured, in, 1054, or, 1055, sijilmasa, was, captured, first, and, its, leader, mas, ud, ibn, wannudin, was, killed, along, with, other, maghrawa, leaders, according, to, historical, sources, the, almoravid, army, rode, on, camels, and, numbered, 30, 000, though, this, number, may, be, an, exaggeration, strengthened, with, the, spoils, of, their, victory, they, left, a, garrison, of, lamtuna, tribesmen, in, the, city, and, then, turned, south, to, capture, awdaghust, which, they, accomplished, that, same, year, although, the, town, was, mainly, muslim, the, almoravids, pillaged, the, city, and, treated, the, population, harshly, on, the, basis, that, they, recognized, the, pagan, king, of, ghana, not, long, after, the, main, almoravid, army, left, sijilmasa, the, city, rebelled, and, the, maghrawa, returned, slaughtering, the, lamtuna, garrison, ibn, yasin, responded, by, organizing, a, second, expedition, to, recapture, it, but, the, guddala, refused, to, join, him, and, returned, instead, to, their, homelands, in, the, desert, regions, along, the, atlantic, coast, historian, amira, bennison, suggests, that, some, almoravids, including, the, guddala, were, unwilling, to, be, dragged, into, a, conflict, with, the, powerful, zanata, tribes, of, the, north, and, this, created, tension, with, those, like, ibn, yasin, who, saw, northern, expansion, as, the, next, step, in, their, fortunes, while, ibn, yasin, went, north, yahya, ibn, umar, remained, in, the, south, in, the, adrar, the, heartland, of, the, lamtuna, in, a, defensible, and, well, provisioned, place, called, jabal, lamtuna, about, 10, kilometres, northwest, of, modern, atar, his, stronghold, there, was, a, fortress, called, azuggi, also, rendered, variably, as, azougui, or, azukki, which, had, been, built, earlier, by, his, brother, yannu, ibn, umar, al, hajj, some, scholars, including, attilio, gaudio, christiane, vanacker, and, brigitte, himpan, and, diane, himpan, sabatier, describe, azuggi, as, the, first, capital, of, the, almoravids, yahya, ibn, umar, was, subsequently, killed, in, battle, against, the, guddala, in, 1055, or, 1056, or, later, in, 1057, meanwhile, in, the, north, ibn, yasin, had, ordered, abu, bakr, to, take, command, of, the, almoravid, army, and, they, soon, recaptured, sijilmasa, by, 1056, they, had, conquered, taroudant, and, the, sous, valley, continuing, to, impose, maliki, islamic, law, over, the, communities, they, conquered, when, the, campaign, concluded, that, year, they, retired, to, sijilmasa, and, established, their, base, there, it, was, around, this, time, that, abu, bakr, appointed, his, cousin, yusuf, ibn, tashfin, to, command, the, garrison, of, the, city, in, 1058, they, crossed, the, high, atlas, and, conquered, aghmat, a, prosperous, commercial, town, near, the, foothills, of, the, mountains, and, made, it, their, capital, they, then, came, in, contact, with, the, barghawata, a, berber, tribal, confederation, who, followed, an, islamic, heresy, preached, by, salih, ibn, tarif, three, centuries, earlier, the, barghawata, occupied, the, region, northwest, of, aghmat, and, along, the, atlantic, coast, they, resisted, the, almoravids, fiercely, and, the, campaign, against, them, was, bloody, abdullah, ibn, yasin, was, killed, in, battle, with, them, in, 1058, or, 1059, at, a, place, called, kur, falalt, or, kurifala, by, 1060, however, they, were, conquered, by, abu, bakr, ibn, umar, and, were, forced, to, convert, to, orthodox, islam, shortly, after, this, abu, bakr, had, reached, as, far, as, meknes, towards, 1068, abu, bakr, married, a, noble, and, wealthy, berber, woman, zaynab, an, nafzawiyyah, who, would, become, very, influential, in, the, development, of, the, dynasty, zaynab, was, the, daughter, of, a, wealthy, merchant, from, kairouan, who, had, settled, in, aghmat, she, had, been, previously, married, to, laqut, ibn, yusuf, ibn, ali, al, maghrawi, the, ruler, of, aghmat, until, the, latter, was, killed, during, the, almoravid, conquest, of, the, city, it, was, around, this, time, that, abu, bakr, ibn, umar, founded, the, new, capital, of, marrakesh, historical, sources, cite, a, variety, of, dates, for, this, event, ranging, from, 1062, given, by, ibn, abi, zar, and, ibn, khaldun, to, 1078, 470, ah, given, by, muhammad, al, idrisi, the, year, 1070, given, by, ibn, idhari, is, more, commonly, used, by, modern, historians, although, 1062, is, still, cited, by, some, writers, shortly, after, founding, the, new, city, abu, bakr, was, compelled, to, return, south, to, the, sahara, in, order, to, suppress, a, rebellion, by, the, guddala, and, their, allies, which, threatened, the, desert, trade, routes, in, either, 1060, or, 1071, his, wife, zaynab, appears, to, have, been, unwilling, to, follow, him, south, and, he, granted, her, a, divorce, apparently, on, abu, bakr, s, instructions, she, was, then, married, to, yusuf, ibn, tashfin, before, leaving, abu, bakr, appointed, ibn, tashfin, as, his, deputy, in, charge, of, the, new, almoravid, territories, in, the, north, according, to, ibn, idhari, zaynab, became, his, most, important, political, advisor, a, year, later, after, suppressing, the, revolt, in, the, south, abu, bakr, returned, north, toward, marrakesh, expecting, to, resume, his, control, of, the, city, and, of, the, almoravid, forces, in, north, africa, ibn, tashfin, however, was, now, unwilling, to, give, up, his, own, position, of, leadership, while, abu, bakr, was, still, camped, near, aghmat, ibn, tashfin, sent, him, lavish, gifts, but, refused, to, obey, his, summons, reportedly, on, the, advice, of, zaynab, abu, bakr, recognized, that, he, was, unable, to, force, the, issue, and, was, unwilling, to, fight, a, battle, over, control, of, marrakesh, so, he, decided, to, voluntarily, recognize, ibn, tashfin, s, leadership, in, the, maghreb, the, two, men, met, on, neutral, ground, between, aghmat, and, marrakesh, to, confirm, the, arrangement, after, a, short, stay, in, aghmat, abu, bakr, returned, south, to, continue, his, leadership, of, the, almoravids, in, the, sahara, following, this, the, almoravid, empire, was, divided, into, two, distinct, but, co, dependent, parts, one, led, by, ibn, tashfin, in, the, north, and, another, led, by, abu, bakr, in, the, south, abu, bakr, continued, to, be, formally, acknowledged, as, the, supreme, leader, of, the, almoravids, until, his, death, in, 1087, historical, sources, give, no, indication, that, the, two, leaders, treated, each, other, as, enemies, and, ibn, tashfin, continued, to, mint, coins, in, abu, bakr, s, name, until, the, latter, s, death, following, abu, bakr, s, departure, ibn, tashfin, was, largely, responsible, for, building, the, almoravid, state, in, the, maghreb, over, the, next, two, decades, one, of, abu, bakr, s, sons, ibrahim, who, served, as, the, almoravid, leader, in, sijilmasa, between, 1071, and, 1076, according, to, the, coinage, minted, there, did, develop, a, rivalry, with, ibn, tashfin, and, attempted, to, confront, him, toward, 1076, he, marched, to, aghmat, with, the, intention, of, reclaiming, his, father, s, position, in, the, maghreb, another, almoravid, commander, mazdali, ibn, tilankan, who, was, related, to, both, men, defused, the, situation, and, convinced, ibrahim, to, join, his, father, in, the, south, rather, than, start, a, civil, war, ibn, tashfin, had, in, the, meantime, helped, to, bring, the, large, area, of, what, is, now, morocco, western, sahara, and, mauritania, under, almoravid, control, he, spent, at, least, several, years, capturing, each, fort, and, settlement, in, the, region, around, fez, and, in, northern, morocco, after, most, of, the, surrounding, region, was, under, his, control, he, was, finally, able, to, conquer, fez, definitively, however, there, is, some, contradiction, and, uncertainty, among, historical, sources, regarding, the, exact, chronology, of, these, conquests, with, some, sources, dating, the, main, conquests, to, the, 1060s, and, others, dating, them, to, the, 1070s, some, modern, authors, cite, the, date, of, the, final, conquest, of, fez, as, 1069, 461, ah, historian, ronald, messier, gives, the, date, more, specifically, as, 18, march, 1070, 462, ah, other, historians, date, this, conquest, to, 1074, or, 1075, in, 1079, ibn, tashfin, sent, an, army, 20, 000, strong, from, marrakesh, to, push, towards, what, is, now, tlemcen, to, attack, the, banu, ya, la, the, zenata, tribe, occupying, the, area, led, by, mazdali, ibn, tilankan, the, army, defeated, the, banu, ya, la, in, battle, near, the, valley, of, the, moulaya, river, and, executed, their, commander, mali, ibn, ya, la, the, son, of, tlemcen, s, ruler, however, ibn, tilankan, did, not, push, to, tlemcen, right, away, as, the, city, of, oujda, occupied, by, the, bani, iznasan, was, too, strong, to, capture, instead, ibn, tashfin, himself, returned, with, an, army, in, 1081, that, captured, oujda, and, then, conquered, tlemcen, massacring, the, maghrawa, forces, there, and, their, leader, al, abbas, ibn, bakhti, al, maghrawi, he, pressed, on, and, by, 1082, he, had, captured, algiers, ibn, tashfin, subsequently, treated, tlemcen, as, his, eastern, base, at, that, time, the, city, had, consisted, of, an, older, settlement, called, agadir, but, ibn, tashfin, founded, a, new, city, next, to, it, called, takrart, which, later, merged, with, agadir, in, the, almohad, period, to, become, the, present, city, the, almoravids, subsequently, clashed, with, the, hammadids, to, the, east, multiple, times, but, they, did, not, make, a, sustained, effort, to, conquer, the, central, maghrib, and, instead, focused, their, efforts, on, other, fronts, eventually, in, 1104, they, signed, a, peace, treaty, with, the, hammadids, algiers, became, their, easternmost, outpost, by, the, 1080s, local, muslim, rulers, in, al, andalus, the, iberian, peninsula, were, requesting, ibn, tashfin, s, help, against, the, encroaching, christian, kingdoms, to, the, north, ibn, tashfin, made, the, capture, of, ceuta, his, primary, objective, before, making, any, attempt, to, intervene, there, ceuta, controlled, by, zenata, forces, under, the, command, of, diya, al, dawla, yahya, was, the, last, major, city, on, the, african, side, of, the, strait, of, gibraltar, that, still, held, out, against, him, in, return, for, a, promise, to, help, him, ibn, tashfin, demanded, that, al, mu, tamid, ibn, abbad, the, ruler, of, seville, provide, assistance, in, besieging, the, city, al, mu, tamid, obliged, and, sent, a, fleet, to, blockade, the, city, by, sea, while, ibn, tashfin, s, son, tamim, led, the, siege, by, land, the, city, finally, surrendered, in, june, july, 1083, or, in, august, 1084, ibn, tashfin, also, made, efforts, to, organize, the, new, almoravid, realm, under, his, rule, the, western, maghreb, was, divided, into, well, defined, administrative, provinces, for, the, first, time, prior, to, this, it, had, been, mostly, tribal, territory, a, developing, central, government, was, established, in, marrakesh, while, he, entrusted, key, provinces, to, important, allies, and, relatives, the, nascent, almoravid, state, was, funded, in, part, by, the, taxes, allowed, under, islamic, law, and, by, the, gold, that, came, from, ghana, in, the, south, but, in, practice, it, remained, dependent, on, the, spoils, of, new, conquests, the, majority, of, the, almoravid, army, continued, to, be, composed, of, sanhaja, recruits, but, ibn, tashfin, also, began, recruiting, slaves, to, form, a, personal, guard, ashm, including, 5000, black, soldiers, abid, and, 500, white, soldiers, uluj, likely, of, european, origin, at, some, point, yusuf, ibn, tashfin, moved, to, acknowledge, the, abbasids, caliphs, in, baghdad, as, overlords, while, the, abbasids, themselves, had, little, direct, political, power, by, this, time, the, symbolism, of, this, act, was, important, and, enhanced, ibn, tashfin, s, legitimacy, according, to, ibn, idhari, it, was, at, the, same, time, as, this, that, ibn, tashfin, also, took, the, title, of, am, r, al, muslim, n, commander, of, the, muslims, ibn, idhari, dates, this, to, 1073, 74, but, some, authors, including, modern, historian, variste, l, vi, proven, al, have, dated, this, political, decision, to, later, most, likely, when, the, almoravids, were, in, the, process, of, securing, control, of, al, andalus, according, to, amira, bennison, the, recognition, of, the, abbasid, caliph, must, have, been, established, by, the, 1090s, at, latest, when, abu, bakr, ibn, al, arabi, visited, baghdad, between, 1096, and, 1098, possibly, as, part, of, an, almoravid, embassy, to, caliph, al, mustazhir, he, claimed, that, the, friday, prayers, were, already, being, given, in, the, abbasid, caliph, s, name, across, the, territories, ruled, by, yusuf, ibn, tashfin, after, leaving, yusuf, ibn, tashfin, in, the, north, and, returning, south, abu, bakr, ibn, umar, reportedly, made, azuggi, his, base, the, town, acted, as, the, capital, of, the, southern, almoravids, under, him, and, his, successors, despite, the, importance, of, the, saharan, trade, routes, to, the, almoravids, the, history, of, the, southern, wing, of, the, empire, is, not, well, documented, in, arabic, historical, sources, and, is, often, neglected, in, histories, of, the, maghreb, and, al, andalus, this, has, also, encouraged, a, division, in, modern, studies, about, the, almoravids, with, archeology, playing, a, greater, role, in, the, study, of, the, southern, wing, in, the, absence, of, more, textual, sources, the, exact, nature, and, impact, of, the, almoravid, presence, in, the, sahel, is, a, strongly, debated, topic, among, africanists, according, to, arab, tradition, the, almoravids, under, abu, bakr, s, leadership, conquered, the, ghana, empire, founded, by, the, soninke, sometime, around, 1076, 77, an, example, of, this, tradition, is, the, record, of, historian, ibn, khaldun, who, cited, shaykh, uthman, the, faqih, of, ghana, writing, in, 1394, according, to, this, source, the, almoravids, weakened, ghana, and, collected, tribute, from, the, sudan, to, the, extent, that, the, authority, of, the, rulers, of, ghana, dwindled, away, and, they, were, subjugated, and, absorbed, by, the, sosso, a, neighboring, people, of, the, sudan, traditions, in, mali, related, that, the, sosso, attacked, and, took, over, mali, as, well, and, the, ruler, of, the, sosso, sumaouro, kant, took, over, the, land, however, criticism, from, conrad, and, fisher, 1982, argued, that, the, notion, of, any, almoravid, military, conquest, at, its, core, is, merely, perpetuated, folklore, derived, from, a, misinterpretation, or, naive, reliance, on, arabic, sources, according, to, professor, timothy, insoll, the, archaeology, of, ancient, ghana, simply, does, not, show, the, signs, of, rapid, change, and, destruction, that, would, be, associated, with, any, almoravid, era, military, conquests, dierke, lange, agreed, with, the, original, military, incursion, theory, but, argues, that, this, doesn, t, preclude, almoravid, political, agitation, claiming, that, the, main, factor, of, the, demise, of, the, ghana, empire, owed, much, to, the, latter, according, to, lange, almoravid, religious, influence, was, gradual, rather, than, the, result, of, military, action, there, the, almoravids, gained, power, by, marrying, among, the, nation, s, nobility, lange, attributes, the, decline, of, ancient, ghana, to, numerous, unrelated, factors, one, of, which, is, likely, attributable, to, internal, dynastic, struggles, instigated, by, almoravid, influence, and, islamic, pressures, but, devoid, of, military, conquest, this, interpretation, of, events, has, been, disputed, by, later, scholars, like, sheryl, l, burkhalter, who, argued, that, whatever, the, nature, of, the, conquest, in, the, south, of, the, sahara, the, influence, and, success, of, the, almoravid, movement, in, securing, west, african, gold, and, circulating, it, widely, necessitated, a, high, degree, of, political, control, the, arab, geographer, ibn, shihab, al, zuhri, wrote, that, the, almoravids, ended, ibadi, islam, in, tadmekka, in, 1084, and, that, abu, bakr, arrived, at, the, mountain, of, gold, in, the, deep, south, abu, bakr, finally, died, in, tagant, in, november, 1087, following, an, injury, in, battle, according, to, oral, tradition, from, an, arrow, while, fighting, in, the, historic, region, of, the, sudan, after, the, death, of, abu, bakr, 1087, the, confederation, of, berber, tribes, in, the, sahara, was, divided, between, the, descendants, of, abu, bakr, and, his, brother, yahya, and, would, have, lost, control, of, ghana, sheryl, burkhalter, suggests, that, abu, bakr, s, son, yahya, was, the, leader, of, the, almoravid, expedition, that, conquered, ghana, in, 1076, and, that, the, almoravids, would, have, survived, the, loss, of, ghana, and, the, defeat, in, the, maghreb, by, the, almohads, and, would, have, ruled, the, sahara, until, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, initially, it, appears, ibn, tashfin, had, little, interest, in, involving, the, almoravids, in, the, politics, of, al, andalus, the, muslim, territories, on, the, iberian, peninsula, after, the, collapse, of, the, caliphate, of, c, rdoba, in, the, early, 11th, century, al, andalus, had, split, into, small, kingdoms, or, city, states, known, as, the, taifas, these, states, constantly, fought, with, each, other, but, were, unable, to, raise, large, armies, of, their, own, so, they, became, reliant, instead, on, the, christian, kingdoms, of, the, north, for, military, support, this, support, was, secured, through, the, regular, payment, of, parias, tributes, to, the, christian, kings, but, the, payments, became, a, fiscal, burden, that, drained, the, treasuries, of, these, local, rulers, in, turn, the, taifa, rulers, burdened, their, subjects, with, increased, taxation, including, taxes, and, tariffs, that, were, not, considered, legal, under, islamic, law, as, the, payments, of, tribute, began, to, falter, the, christian, kingdoms, resorted, to, punitive, raids, and, eventually, to, conquest, the, taifa, kings, were, unwilling, or, unable, to, unite, to, counter, this, threat, and, even, the, most, powerful, taifa, kingdom, seville, was, unable, to, resist, christian, advances, after, the, almoravid, capture, of, ceuta, 1083, on, the, southern, shore, of, the, strait, of, gibraltar, the, way, was, now, open, for, ibn, tashfin, to, intervene, in, al, andalus, it, was, in, this, same, year, that, alfonso, vi, king, of, castile, and, le, n, led, a, military, campaign, into, southern, al, andalus, to, punish, al, mu, tamid, of, seville, for, failing, to, pay, him, tribute, his, expedition, penetrated, all, the, way, to, tarifa, the, southernmost, point, of, the, iberian, peninsula, a, couple, of, years, later, in, may, 1085, he, seized, control, of, toledo, previously, one, of, the, most, powerful, city, states, in, al, andalus, soon, after, he, also, began, a, siege, of, zaragoza, these, dramatic, events, forced, the, taifa, kings, to, finally, consider, seeking, an, external, intervention, by, the, almoravids, according, to, the, most, detailed, arabic, source, it, was, al, mu, tamid, the, ruler, of, seville, who, convened, a, meeting, with, his, neighbours, al, mutawwakil, of, badajoz, and, abdallah, ibn, buluggin, of, granada, where, they, agreed, to, send, an, embassy, to, ibn, tashfin, to, appeal, for, his, assistance, the, taifa, kings, were, aware, of, the, risks, that, came, with, an, almoravid, intervention, but, considered, it, the, best, choice, among, their, bad, options, al, mu, tamid, is, said, to, have, remarked, bitterly, better, to, pasture, camels, than, to, be, a, swineherd, meaning, that, it, was, better, to, submit, to, another, muslim, ruler, than, to, end, up, as, subjects, of, a, christian, king, as, a, condition, for, his, assistance, ibn, tashfin, demanded, that, algeciras, a, city, on, the, northern, shore, of, the, strait, of, gibraltar, across, from, ceuta, be, surrendered, to, him, so, he, could, use, it, as, a, base, for, his, troops, al, mu, tamid, agreed, ibn, tashfin, wary, of, the, hesitation, of, the, taifa, kings, immediately, sent, an, advance, force, of, 500, troops, across, the, strait, to, take, control, of, algeciras, they, did, so, in, july, 1086, without, encountering, resistance, the, rest, of, the, almoravid, army, numbering, around, 12, 000, soon, followed, ibn, tashfin, and, his, army, then, marched, to, seville, where, they, met, up, with, the, forces, of, al, mu, tamid, al, mutawwakil, and, abdallah, ibn, buluggin, alfonso, vi, hearing, of, this, development, lifted, his, siege, of, zaragoza, and, marched, south, to, confront, them, the, two, sides, met, at, a, place, north, of, badajoz, called, zallaqa, in, arabic, sources, and, sagrajas, in, christian, sources, in, the, battle, of, sagrajas, or, battle, of, zallaqa, on, 23, october, 1086, alfonso, was, soundly, defeated, and, forced, to, retreat, north, in, disorder, al, mu, tamid, recommended, that, they, press, their, advantage, but, ibn, tashfin, did, not, pursue, the, christian, army, further, returning, instead, to, seville, and, then, to, north, africa, it, is, possible, he, was, unwilling, to, be, away, from, his, home, base, for, too, long, or, that, the, death, of, his, eldest, son, sir, encouraged, him, to, return, after, ibn, tashfin, s, departure, alfonso, vi, quickly, resumed, his, pressure, on, the, taifa, kings, and, forced, them, to, send, tribute, payments, again, he, captured, the, fortress, of, aledo, cutting, off, eastern, al, andalus, from, the, other, muslim, kingdoms, meanwhile, ibn, rashiq, the, ruler, of, murcia, was, embroiled, in, a, rivalry, with, al, mu, tamid, of, seville, as, a, result, this, time, it, was, the, elites, or, notables, wuj, h, of, al, andalus, who, now, called, for, help, from, the, almoravids, rather, than, the, kings, in, may, june, 1088, ibn, tashfin, landed, at, algeciras, with, another, army, soon, joined, by, al, mu, tamid, of, seville, by, abdallah, ibn, buluggin, of, granada, and, by, other, troops, sent, by, ibn, sumadih, of, almer, a, and, ibn, rashiq, of, murcia, they, then, set, out, to, retake, aledo, the, siege, however, was, undermined, by, rivalries, and, disunity, among, the, taifa, kings, news, eventually, reached, the, muslims, that, alfonso, vi, was, bringing, an, army, to, help, the, castilian, garrison, in, november, 1088, ibn, tashfin, lifted, the, siege, and, returned, to, north, africa, again, having, achieved, nothing, alfonso, vi, sent, his, trusted, commander, alvar, fa, ez, to, pressure, the, taifa, kings, again, he, succeeded, in, forcing, abdallah, ibn, buluggin, to, resume, tribute, payments, and, began, to, pressure, al, mu, tamid, in, turn, in, 1090, ibn, tashfin, returned, to, al, andalus, yet, again, but, by, this, point, he, seemed, to, have, given, up, on, the, taifa, kings, and, now, intended, to, take, direct, control, of, the, region, the, almoravid, cause, benefited, from, the, support, of, the, maliki, fuqah, islamic, jurists, in, al, andalus, who, extolled, the, almoravid, devotion, to, jihad, while, criticizing, the, taifa, kings, as, impious, self, indulgent, and, thus, illegitimate, in, september, 1090, ibn, tashfin, forced, granada, to, surrender, to, him, and, sent, abdallah, ibn, buluggin, into, exile, in, aghmat, he, then, returned, to, north, africa, again, but, this, time, he, left, his, nephew, sir, ibn, abu, bakr, in, charge, of, almoravid, forces, in, al, andalus, al, mu, tamid, seeking, to, salvage, his, position, resorted, to, striking, an, alliance, with, alfonso, vi, which, further, undermined, his, own, popular, support, in, early, 1091, the, almoravids, took, control, of, cordoba, and, turned, towards, seville, defeating, a, castilian, force, led, alvar, fa, ez, that, came, to, help, al, mu, tamid, in, september, 1091, al, mu, tamid, surrendered, seville, to, the, almoravids, and, was, exiled, to, aghmat, in, late, 1091, the, almoravids, captured, almer, a, in, late, 1091, or, january, 1092, ibn, aisha, one, of, ibn, tashfin, s, sons, seized, control, of, murcia, the, capture, of, murcia, brought, the, almoravids, within, reach, of, valencia, which, was, officially, under, the, control, of, al, qadir, the, former, taifa, ruler, of, toledo, he, had, been, installed, here, in, 1086, by, the, castilians, after, they, took, control, of, toledo, al, qadir, s, unpopular, rule, in, valencia, was, supported, by, a, castilian, garrison, headed, by, rodrigo, d, az, de, vivar, a, castilian, noble, and, mercenary, better, known, today, as, el, cid, in, october, 1092, when, el, cid, was, away, from, the, city, there, was, an, insurrection, and, coup, d, tat, led, by, the, qadi, judge, abu, ahmad, ja, far, ibn, jahhaf, the, latter, called, for, help, from, the, almoravids, in, murcia, who, sent, a, small, group, of, warriors, to, the, city, the, castilian, garrison, was, forced, to, leave, and, al, qadir, was, captured, and, executed, however, the, almoravids, did, not, send, enough, forces, to, oppose, el, cid, s, return, and, ibn, jahhaf, undermined, his, popular, support, by, proceeding, to, install, himself, as, ruler, acting, like, yet, another, taifa, king, el, cid, began, a, long, siege, of, the, city, completely, surrounding, it, burning, nearby, villages, and, confiscating, the, crops, of, the, surrounding, countryside, ibn, jahhaf, agreed, at, one, point, to, pay, tribute, to, el, cid, in, order, to, end, the, siege, which, resulted, in, the, almoravids, in, the, city, being, escorted, out, by, el, cid, s, men, for, reasons, that, remain, unclear, an, almoravid, relief, army, led, by, ibn, tashfin, s, nephew, abu, bakr, ibn, ibrahim, approached, valencia, in, september, 1093, but, then, retreated, without, engaging, el, cid, ibn, jahhaf, continued, negotiations, in, the, end, he, refused, to, pay, el, cid, s, tribute, and, the, siege, continued, by, april, 1094, the, city, was, starving, and, he, decided, to, surrender, it, shortly, after, el, cid, re, entered, valencia, on, 15, june, 1094, after, 20, months, of, siege, rather, than, ruling, through, a, puppet, again, he, now, took, direct, control, as, king, meanwhile, also, in, 1094, the, almoravids, seized, control, of, the, entire, taifa, kingdom, of, badajoz, after, its, ruler, al, mutawwakil, sought, his, own, alliance, with, castile, the, almoravid, expedition, was, led, by, sir, ibn, abu, bakr, who, had, been, appointed, as, governor, of, seville, the, almoravids, then, returned, their, attention, to, valencia, where, another, of, ibn, tashfin, s, nephews, muhammad, ibn, ibrahim, was, ordered, to, take, the, city, he, arrived, outside, its, walls, in, october, 1094, and, began, attacks, on, the, city, the, siege, ended, when, el, cid, launched, a, two, sided, attack, he, sent, a, sortie, from, one, city, gate, that, posed, as, his, main, force, occupying, the, almoravid, troops, while, he, personally, led, another, force, from, a, different, city, gate, and, attacked, their, undefended, camp, this, inflicted, the, first, major, defeat, on, the, almoravids, on, the, iberian, peninsula, after, his, victory, el, cid, executed, ibn, jahhaf, by, burning, him, alive, in, public, perhaps, in, retaliation, for, treachery, el, cid, fortified, his, new, kingdom, by, building, fortresses, along, the, southern, approaches, to, the, city, to, defend, against, future, almoravid, attacks, in, late, 1096, ibn, aisha, led, an, army, of, 30, 000, men, to, besiege, the, strongest, of, these, fortresses, pe, a, cadiella, just, south, of, xativa, el, cid, confronted, them, and, called, on, aragon, for, reinforcements, when, the, reinforcements, approached, the, almoravids, lifted, the, siege, but, laid, a, trap, for, el, cid, s, forces, as, they, marched, back, to, valencia, they, successfully, ambushed, the, christians, in, a, narrow, pass, located, between, the, mountains, and, the, sea, but, el, cid, managed, to, rally, his, troops, and, repel, the, almoravids, yet, again, in, 1097, the, almoravid, governor, of, xativa, ali, ibn, al, hajj, led, another, incursion, into, valencian, territory, but, was, quickly, defeated, and, pursued, to, almenara, which, el, cid, then, captured, after, a, three, month, siege, in, 1097, yusuf, ibn, tashfin, himself, led, another, army, into, al, andalus, setting, out, from, cordoba, with, muhammad, ibn, al, hajj, as, his, field, commander, he, marched, against, alfonso, vi, who, was, in, toledo, at, the, time, the, castilians, were, routed, at, the, battle, of, consuegra, el, cid, was, not, involved, but, his, son, diego, was, killed, in, the, battle, soon, after, alvar, fa, ez, was, also, defeated, near, cuenca, in, another, battle, with, the, almoravids, led, by, ibn, aisha, the, latter, followed, up, this, victory, by, ravaging, the, lands, around, valencia, and, defeated, another, army, sent, by, el, cid, despite, these, victories, in, the, field, the, almoravids, did, not, capture, any, major, new, towns, or, fortresses, el, cid, attempted, to, christianize, valencia, converting, its, main, mosque, into, a, church, and, establishing, a, bishopric, but, ultimately, failed, to, attract, many, new, christian, settlers, to, the, city, he, died, on, 10, july, 1099, leaving, his, wife, jimena, in, charge, of, the, kingdom, she, was, unable, to, hold, off, almoravid, pressures, which, culminated, in, a, siege, of, the, city, by, the, veteran, almoravid, commander, mazdali, in, the, early, spring, of, 1102, in, april, may, jimena, and, the, christians, who, wished, to, leave, the, city, were, evacuated, with, the, help, of, alfonso, vi, the, almoravids, occupied, the, city, after, them, that, same, year, with, the, capture, of, valencia, counting, as, another, triumph, yusuf, ibn, tashfin, celebrated, and, arranged, for, his, son, ali, ibn, yusuf, to, be, publicly, recognized, as, his, heir, the, taifa, king, of, zaragoza, the, only, other, muslim, power, left, in, the, peninsula, sent, an, ambassador, on, this, occasion, and, signed, a, treaty, with, the, almoravids, by, the, time, ibn, tashfin, died, in, 1106, the, almoravids, were, thus, in, control, of, all, of, al, andalus, except, for, zaragoza, in, general, they, had, not, reconquered, any, of, the, lands, lost, to, the, christian, kingdoms, in, the, previous, century, ali, ibn, yusuf, r, 1106, 1143, was, born, in, ceuta, and, educated, in, the, traditions, of, al, andalus, unlike, his, predecessors, who, were, from, the, sahara, according, to, some, scholars, ali, ibn, yusuf, represented, a, new, generation, of, leadership, that, had, forgotten, the, desert, life, for, the, comforts, of, the, city, his, long, reign, of, 37, years, is, historically, overshadowed, by, the, defeats, and, deteriorating, circumstances, that, characterized, the, later, years, but, the, first, decade, or, so, prior, to, 1118, was, characterized, by, continuing, military, successes, enabled, in, large, part, by, skilled, generals, while, the, almoravids, remained, dominant, in, field, battles, military, shortcomings, were, becoming, apparent, in, their, relative, inability, to, sustain, and, win, long, sieges, in, these, early, years, the, almoravid, state, was, also, wealthy, minting, more, gold, than, ever, before, and, ali, ibn, yusuf, embarked, on, ambitious, building, projects, especially, in, marrakesh, upon, his, enthronement, ali, ibn, yusuf, was, accepted, as, the, new, ruler, by, most, almoravid, subjects, except, for, his, nephew, yahya, ibn, abu, bakr, the, governor, of, fes, ali, ibn, yusuf, marched, his, army, to, the, gates, of, fes, causing, yahya, to, flee, to, tlemcen, there, the, veteran, almoravid, commander, mazdali, convinced, yahya, to, reconcile, with, his, uncle, yahya, agreed, went, on, a, pilgrimage, to, mecca, and, upon, his, return, he, was, allowed, to, rejoin, ali, ibn, yusuf, s, court, in, marrakesh, ali, ibn, yusuf, visited, al, andalus, for, the, first, time, of, his, reign, in, 1107, he, organized, the, almoravid, administration, there, and, placed, his, brother, tamim, as, overall, governor, with, granada, acting, as, the, administrative, capital, the, first, major, offensive, in, al, andalus, during, his, reign, took, place, in, the, summer, of, 1108, tamim, assisted, by, troops, from, murcia, and, cordoba, besieged, and, captured, the, small, fortified, town, of, ucl, s, east, of, toledo, alfonso, vi, sent, a, relief, force, led, by, the, veteran, alvar, fa, ez, that, was, defeated, on, 29, may, in, the, battle, of, ucl, s, the, result, was, made, worse, for, alfonso, vi, because, his, son, and, heir, sancho, died, in, the, battle, in, the, aftermath, the, castilians, abandoned, cuenca, and, huete, which, opened, the, way, for, an, almoravid, invasion, of, toledo, this, came, in, the, summer, of, 1109, with, ali, ibn, yusuf, crossing, over, to, lead, the, campaign, in, person, the, death, of, alfonso, vi, in, june, must, have, provided, another, advantage, to, the, almoravids, talavera, west, of, toledo, was, captured, on, 14, august, toledo, itself, however, resisted, under, the, leadership, of, alvar, fa, ez, unable, to, overcome, the, city, s, formidable, defenses, ali, ibn, yusuf, eventually, retreated, without, capturing, it, meanwhile, the, taifa, king, of, zaragoza, al, musta, in, was, a, capable, ruler, but, faced, conflicting, pressures, like, the, previous, taifa, rulers, he, continued, to, pay, parias, to, the, christian, kingdoms, to, keep, the, peace, but, popular, sentiment, within, the, city, opposed, this, policy, and, increasingly, supported, the, almoravids, to, appease, this, sentiment, al, musta, in, embarked, on, an, expedition, against, the, christians, of, aragon, but, it, failed, he, died, in, battle, in, january, 1110, at, valtierra, his, son, and, successor, imad, al, dawla, was, unable, to, establish, his, authority, and, faced, with, the, threat, of, revolt, fled, the, city, ali, ibn, yusuf, seized, the, opportunity, and, gave, muhammad, ibn, al, hajj, the, task, of, capturing, zaragoza, on, 30, may, ibn, al, hajj, entered, the, city, with, little, opposition, ending, the, last, independent, taifa, kingdom, the, almoravids, remained, on, the, offensive, in, the, following, years, but, some, of, their, best, generals, died, during, this, time, in, 1111, sir, ibn, abu, bakr, governor, of, seville, campaigned, in, the, west, occupying, lisbon, and, santar, m, and, securing, the, frontier, along, the, tagus, river, muhammad, ibn, al, hajj, continued, to, be, active, in, the, east, his, expedition, to, huesca, in, 1112, was, the, last, time, that, muslim, forces, operated, near, the, pyrenees, in, 1114, he, campaigned, in, catalonia, and, raided, across, the, region, aided, by, ibn, aisha, from, valencia, on, their, return, march, however, the, almoravids, were, ambushed, and, both, commanders, were, killed, in, late, 1113, sir, ibn, abu, bakr, passed, away, in, 1115, it, was, mazdali, one, of, the, most, veteran, and, loyal, allies, of, yusuf, ibn, tashfin, s, family, who, died, in, battle, while, serving, as, governor, of, cordoba, and, campaigning, to, the, north, of, it, together, these, deaths, represented, a, major, loss, of, senior, and, capable, commanders, for, the, almoravids, in, 1115, the, new, governor, of, zaragoza, abu, bakr, ibn, ibrahim, ibn, tifilwit, besieged, barcelona, for, 27, days, while, count, ramon, berengar, iii, was, in, majorca, they, lifted, the, siege, when, the, count, returned, but, in, that, same, year, the, almoravids, captured, the, balearic, islands, which, had, been, temporarily, occupied, by, the, catalans, and, pisans, the, almoravids, occupied, majorca, without, a, fight, after, the, death, of, the, last, local, muslim, ruler, mubashir, al, dawla, ali, ibn, yusuf, made, his, third, crossing, into, al, andalus, in, 1117, to, lead, an, attack, on, coimbra, after, only, a, short, siege, however, he, withdrew, his, army, raided, along, the, way, back, to, seville, and, won, significant, spoils, but, it, was, a, further, sign, that, almoravid, initiative, was, being, depleted, almoravid, fortunes, began, to, turn, definitively, after, 1117, while, l, on, and, castile, were, in, disarray, following, the, death, of, alfonso, vi, other, christian, kingdoms, exploited, opportunities, to, expand, their, territories, at, the, expense, of, the, almoravids, in, 1118, alfonso, i, el, batallador, the, battler, king, of, aragon, launched, a, successful, attack, on, zaragoza, with, the, help, of, the, french, crusader, gaston, de, b, arn, the, siege, of, the, city, began, on, 22, may, and, after, no, significant, reinforcements, arrived, it, surrendered, on, 18, december, ali, ibn, yusuf, ordered, a, major, expedition, to, recover, the, loss, but, it, suffered, a, serious, defeat, at, the, battle, of, cutanda, in, 1120, the, crisis, is, evidence, that, almoravid, forces, were, over, extended, across, their, vast, territories, when, the, almoravid, governor, of, zaragoza, abd, allah, ibn, mazdali, had, died, earlier, in, 1118, no, replacement, was, forthcoming, and, the, almoravid, garrison, left, in, the, city, prior, to, the, siege, seems, to, have, been, very, small, it, is, possible, that, yusuf, ibn, tashfin, had, understood, this, problem, and, had, intended, to, leave, zaragoza, as, a, buffer, state, between, the, almoravids, and, the, christians, as, suggested, by, an, apocryphal, story, in, the, hulul, al, mawshiya, a, 14th, century, chronicle, which, reports, that, ibn, tashfin, while, on, his, deathbed, advised, his, son, to, follow, this, policy, alfonso, i, s, capture, of, zaragoza, in, 1118, along, with, the, union, of, aragon, with, the, counties, of, catalonia, in, 1137, also, transformed, the, kingdom, of, aragon, into, a, major, christian, power, in, the, region, to, the, west, afonso, i, of, portugal, asserted, his, independent, authority, and, effectively, created, the, kingdom, of, portugal, the, growing, power, of, these, kingdoms, added, to, the, political, difficulties, muslims, now, faced, in, the, iberian, peninsula, this, major, reversal, precipitated, a, decline, in, popular, support, for, the, almoravids, at, least, in, al, andalus, andalusi, society, largely, cooperated, with, the, almoravids, on, the, understanding, that, they, could, keep, the, aggressive, christian, kingdoms, at, bay, once, this, was, no, longer, the, case, their, authority, became, increasingly, hollow, their, legitimacy, was, further, undermined, by, the, issue, of, taxation, one, of, the, main, appeals, of, early, almoravid, rule, had, been, its, mission, to, eliminate, non, canonical, taxes, i, e, those, not, sanctioned, by, the, qur, an, thus, relieving, the, people, of, a, major, fiscal, burden, however, it, was, not, feasible, to, finance, almoravid, armies, in, the, fight, against, multiple, enemies, across, a, large, empire, with, the, funding, from, quranic, taxes, alone, ali, ibn, yusuf, was, thus, forced, to, reintroduce, non, canonical, taxes, while, the, almoravids, were, losing, ground, these, developments, may, have, been, factors, in, sparking, an, uprising, in, cordoba, in, 1121, the, almoravid, governor, was, besieged, in, his, palace, and, the, rebellion, became, so, serious, that, ali, ibn, yusuf, crossed, over, into, al, andalus, to, deal, with, it, himself, his, army, besieged, cordoba, but, eventually, a, peace, was, negotiated, between, the, almoravid, governor, and, the, population, this, was, the, last, time, ali, ibn, yusuf, visited, al, andalus, alfonso, i, of, aragon, inflicted, further, humiliations, upon, the, almoravids, in, the, 1120s, in, 1125, he, marched, down, the, eastern, coast, reached, granada, though, he, refrained, from, besieging, it, and, devastated, the, countryside, around, cordoba, in, 1129, he, raided, the, region, of, valencia, and, defeated, an, army, sent, to, stop, him, the, almoravid, position, in, al, andalus, was, only, shored, up, in, the, 1130s, in, 1129, following, alfonso, i, s, attacks, ali, ibn, yusuf, sent, his, son, and, later, successor, tashfin, ibn, ali, to, re, organize, the, military, structure, in, al, andalus, his, governorship, grew, to, include, granada, almeria, and, cordoba, becoming, in, effect, the, governor, of, al, andalus, for, many, years, where, he, performed, capably, the, banu, ghaniya, clan, relatives, of, the, ruling, almoravid, dynasty, also, became, important, players, during, this, period, yahya, ibn, ali, ibn, ghaniya, was, governor, of, murcia, up, to, 1133, while, his, brother, was, governor, of, the, balearic, islands, after, 1126, for, much, of, the, 1130s, tashfin, and, yahya, led, the, almoravid, forces, to, a, number, of, victories, over, christian, forces, and, reconquered, some, towns, the, most, significant, was, the, battle, of, fraga, in, 1134, where, the, almoravids, led, by, yahya, defeated, an, aragonese, army, besieging, the, small, muslim, town, of, fraga, notably, alfonso, i, el, batallor, was, wounded, and, died, shortly, after, the, greatest, challenge, to, almoravid, authority, came, from, the, maghreb, in, the, form, of, the, almohad, movement, the, movement, was, founded, by, ibn, tumart, in, the, 1120s, and, then, continued, after, his, death, c, 1130, under, his, successor, abd, al, mu, min, they, established, their, base, at, tinmal, in, the, high, atlas, mountains, south, of, marrakesh, and, from, here, they, progressively, rolled, back, almoravid, territories, the, struggle, against, the, almohads, was, immensely, draining, on, almoravid, resources, and, contributed, to, their, shortage, of, manpower, elsewhere, including, in, al, andalus, it, also, required, the, construction, of, large, fortresses, in, the, almoravid, heartlands, in, present, day, morocco, such, as, the, fortress, of, tasghimut, on, ali, ibn, yusuf, s, orders, defensive, walls, were, built, around, the, capital, of, marrakesh, for, the, first, time, in, 1126, in, 1138, he, recalled, his, son, tashfin, to, marrakesh, in, order, to, assist, in, the, fight, against, the, almohads, removing, him, from, al, andalus, only, further, weakened, the, almoravid, position, there, in, 1138, the, almoravids, suffered, a, defeat, at, the, hands, of, alfonso, vii, of, le, n, and, castile, in, the, battle, of, ourique, 1139, they, were, defeated, by, afonso, i, of, portugal, who, thereby, won, his, crown, during, the, 1140s, the, situation, grew, steadily, worse, after, ali, ibn, yusuf, s, death, in, 1143, his, son, tashfin, ibn, ali, lost, ground, rapidly, before, the, almohads, in, 1146, he, was, killed, in, a, fall, from, a, precipice, while, attempting, to, escape, after, a, defeat, near, oran, the, muridun, staged, a, major, revolt, in, southwestern, iberia, in, 1144, under, the, leadership, of, the, sufi, mystic, ibn, qasi, who, later, passed, to, the, almohads, lisbon, was, conquered, by, the, portuguese, in, 1147, tashfin, s, two, successors, were, ibrahim, ibn, tashfin, and, ishaq, ibn, ali, but, their, reigns, were, short, the, conquest, of, marrakesh, by, the, almohads, in, 1147, marked, the, fall, of, the, dynasty, though, fragments, of, the, almoravids, continued, to, struggle, throughout, the, empire, among, these, fragments, there, was, the, rebel, yahya, al, sahr, wiyya, who, resisted, almohad, rule, in, the, maghreb, for, eight, years, after, the, fall, of, marrakesh, before, surrendering, in, 1155, also, in, 1155, the, remaining, almoravids, were, forced, to, retreat, to, the, balearic, islands, and, later, ifriqiya, under, the, leadership, of, the, banu, ghaniya, who, were, eventually, influential, in, the, downfall, of, their, conquerors, the, almohads, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, maghreb, the, almoravids, adopted, the, black, standard, both, to, mark, a, religious, character, to, their, political, and, military, movement, as, well, as, their, religious, and, political, legitimacy, which, was, demonstrated, through, their, connection, to, the, abbasid, caliphate, according, to, some, authors, the, black, color, marked, the, fight, against, impiety, and, error, it, was, also, considered, a, representation, of, prophet, muhammad, s, flag, however, most, sources, indicate, a, clear, affiliation, with, the, abbasid, caliphs, regarded, as, the, supreme, religious, and, secular, authority, of, sunni, islam, historian, tayeb, el, hibri, writes, from, far, off, maghreb, an, emissary, of, the, almoravid, ali, bin, yusuf, bin, tashfin, came, to, baghdad, in, 498, 1104, declaring, allegiance, to, the, abbasids, announcing, the, adoption, of, the, official, abbasid, black, for, banners, and, received, the, title, amir, al, muslimin, wa, nasir, amir, al, mu, minin, prince, of, the, muslims, and, helper, of, the, commander, of, the, faithful, thus, the, almoravids, adopted, all, the, symbols, of, the, abbasids, including, the, color, black, al, aswad, which, would, take, part, in, the, social, and, cultural, life, of, the, almoravid, tribes, in, their, peace, and, war, time, the, desert, tribes, of, lamtuna, and, massufa, would, adopt, the, black, color, for, their, veil, when, wrapped, around, the, head, and, for, war, banners, in, their, battles, in, al, andalus, later, on, the, black, banner, would, be, attested, in, clashes, and, uprisings, opposing, almoravid, and, almohad, movements, the, almohads, would, adopt, the, white, flag, against, almoravid, authority, while, major, anti, almohad, rebellions, unleashed, by, the, banu, ghaniya, in, the, maghreb, and, hudids, in, al, andalus, would, confirm, their, affiliation, to, the, abbasids, in, the, same, manner, as, the, early, almoravid, movement, did, the, almoravid, movement, started, as, a, conservative, islamic, reform, movement, inspired, by, the, maliki, school, of, jurisprudence, the, writings, of, abu, imran, al, fasi, a, moroccan, maliki, scholar, influenced, yahya, ibn, ibrahim, and, the, early, almoravid, movement, amira, bennison, describes, the, art, of, the, almoravid, period, as, influenced, by, the, integration, of, several, areas, into, a, single, political, unit, and, the, resultant, development, of, a, widespread, andalusi, maghribi, style, as, well, as, the, tastes, of, the, sanhaja, rulers, as, patrons, of, art, bennison, also, challenges, robert, hillenbrand, s, characterization, of, the, art, of, al, andalus, and, the, maghreb, as, provincial, and, peripheral, in, consideration, of, islamic, art, globally, and, of, the, contributions, of, the, almoravids, as, sparse, as, a, result, of, the, empire, s, puritanical, fervour, and, ephemerality, at, first, the, almoravids, subscribing, to, the, conservative, maliki, school, of, islamic, jurisprudence, rejected, what, they, perceived, as, decadence, and, a, lack, of, piety, among, the, iberian, muslims, of, the, andalusi, taifa, kingdoms, however, monuments, and, textiles, from, almer, a, from, the, late, almoravid, period, indicate, that, the, empire, had, changed, its, attitude, with, time, artistic, production, under, the, almoravids, included, finely, constructed, minbars, produced, in, c, rdoba, marble, basins, and, tombstones, in, almer, a, fine, textiles, in, almer, a, m, laga, seville, and, luxury, ceramics, a, large, group, of, marble, tombstones, have, been, preserved, from, the, first, half, of, the, 12th, century, they, were, crafted, in, almer, a, in, al, andalus, at, a, time, when, it, was, a, prosperous, port, city, under, almoravid, control, the, tombstones, were, made, of, macael, marble, which, was, quarried, locally, and, carved, with, extensive, kufic, inscriptions, that, were, sometimes, adorned, with, vegetal, or, geometric, motifs, these, demonstrate, that, the, almoravids, not, only, reused, umayyad, marble, columns, and, basins, but, also, commissioned, new, works, the, inscriptions, on, them, are, dedicated, to, various, individuals, both, men, and, women, from, a, range, of, different, occupations, indicating, that, such, tombstones, were, relatively, affordable, the, stones, take, the, form, of, either, rectangular, stelae, or, of, long, horizontal, prisms, known, as, mqabriyya, s, similar, to, the, ones, found, in, the, much, later, saadian, tombs, of, marrakesh, they, have, been, found, in, many, locations, across, west, africa, and, western, europe, which, is, evidence, that, a, wide, reaching, industry, and, trade, in, marble, existed, a, number, of, pieces, found, in, france, were, likely, acquired, from, later, pillaging, some, of, the, most, ornate, tombstones, found, outside, al, andalus, were, discovered, in, gao, saney, in, the, african, sahel, testament, to, the, reach, of, almoravid, influence, into, the, african, continent, two, almoravid, period, marble, columns, have, also, been, found, reused, as, spolia, in, later, monuments, in, fes, one, is, incorporated, into, the, window, of, the, dar, al, muwaqqit, timekeeper, s, house, overlooking, the, courtyard, of, the, qarawiyyin, mosque, built, in, the, marinid, period, the, other, is, embedded, into, the, decoration, of, the, exterior, southern, fa, ade, of, the, zawiya, of, moulay, idris, ii, a, structure, which, was, rebuilt, by, ismail, ibn, sharif, the, fact, that, ibn, tumart, leader, of, the, almohad, movement, is, recorded, as, having, criticized, sultan, ali, ibn, yusuf, for, sitting, on, a, luxurious, silken, cloak, at, his, grand, mosque, in, marrakesh, indicates, the, important, role, of, textiles, under, the, almoravids, many, of, the, remaining, fabrics, from, the, almoravid, period, were, reused, by, christians, with, examples, in, the, reliquary, of, san, isidoro, in, le, n, a, chasuble, from, saint, sernin, in, toulouse, the, chasuble, of, san, juan, de, ortega, in, the, church, of, quintanaortu, a, near, burgos, the, shroud, of, san, pedro, de, osma, and, a, fragment, found, at, the, church, of, thuir, in, the, eastern, pyrenees, some, of, these, pieces, are, characterized, by, the, appearance, of, kufic, or, hispano, kufic, woven, inscriptions, with, letters, sometimes, ending, in, ornamental, vegetal, flourishes, the, chasuble, of, san, juan, de, ortega, is, one, such, example, made, of, silk, and, gold, thread, and, dating, to, the, first, half, of, the, 12th, century, the, shroud, of, san, pedro, de, osma, is, notable, for, its, inscription, stating, this, was, made, in, baghdad, suggesting, that, it, was, imported, however, more, recent, scholarship, has, suggested, that, the, textile, was, instead, produced, locally, in, centres, such, as, almeria, but, that, they, were, copied, or, based, on, eastern, imports, it, s, even, possible, that, the, inscription, was, knowingly, falsified, in, order, to, exaggerate, its, value, to, potential, sellers, al, saqati, of, m, laga, a, 12th, century, writer, and, market, inspector, wrote, that, there, were, regulations, designed, to, prohibit, the, practice, of, making, such, false, inscriptions, as, a, result, of, the, inscription, many, of, these, textiles, are, known, in, scholarship, as, the, baghdad, group, representing, a, stylistically, coherent, and, artistically, rich, group, of, silken, textiles, seemingly, dating, to, reign, of, ali, ibn, yusuf, or, the, first, half, of, the, 12th, century, aside, from, the, inscription, the, shroud, of, san, pedro, de, osma, is, decorated, with, images, of, two, lions, and, harpies, inside, roundels, that, are, ringed, by, images, of, small, men, holding, griffins, repeating, across, the, whole, fabric, the, chasuble, from, saint, sernin, is, likewise, decorated, with, figural, images, in, this, case, a, pair, of, peacocks, repeating, in, horizontal, bands, with, vegetal, stems, separating, each, pair, and, small, kufic, inscriptions, running, along, the, bottom, the, decorative, theme, of, having, a, regular, grid, of, roundels, containing, images, of, animals, and, figures, with, more, abstract, motifs, filling, the, spaces, in, between, has, origins, traced, as, far, back, as, persian, sasanian, textiles, in, subsequent, periods, starting, with, the, almohads, these, roundels, with, figurative, imagery, are, progressively, replaced, with, more, abstract, roundels, while, epigraphic, decoration, becomes, more, prominent, than, before, in, early, islamic, manuscripts, kufic, was, the, main, script, used, for, religious, texts, western, or, maghrebi, kufic, evolved, from, the, standard, or, eastern, kufic, style, and, was, marked, by, the, transformation, of, the, low, swooping, sections, of, letters, from, rectangular, forms, to, long, semi, circular, forms, it, is, found, in, 10th, century, qurans, before, the, almoravid, period, almoravid, kufic, is, the, variety, of, maghrebi, kufic, script, that, was, used, as, an, official, display, script, during, the, almoravid, period, eventually, maghrebi, kufic, gave, rise, to, a, distinctive, cursive, script, known, as, maghrebi, the, only, cursive, script, of, arabic, derived, from, kufic, which, was, fully, formed, by, the, early, 12th, century, under, the, almoravids, this, style, was, commonly, used, in, qurans, and, other, religious, works, from, this, period, onward, but, it, was, rarely, ever, used, in, architectural, inscriptions, one, version, of, this, script, during, this, early, period, is, the, andalusi, script, which, was, associated, with, al, andalus, it, was, usually, finer, and, denser, and, while, the, loops, of, letters, below, the, line, are, semi, circular, the, extensions, of, letters, above, the, line, continue, to, use, straight, lines, that, recall, its, kufic, origins, another, version, of, the, script, is, rounder, and, larger, and, is, more, associated, with, the, maghreb, although, it, is, nonetheless, found, in, andalusi, volumes, too, the, oldest, known, illuminated, quran, from, the, western, islamic, world, i, e, the, maghreb, and, al, andalus, dates, from, 1090, towards, the, end, of, the, first, taifas, period, and, the, beginning, of, the, almoravid, domination, in, al, andalus, 304, it, was, produced, either, in, the, maghreb, or, al, andalus, and, is, now, kept, at, the, uppsala, university, library, its, decoration, is, still, in, the, earliest, phases, of, artistic, development, lacking, the, sophistication, of, later, volumes, but, many, of, the, features, that, were, standard, in, later, manuscripts, are, present, the, script, is, written, in, the, maghrebi, style, in, black, ink, but, the, diacritics, vowels, and, other, orthographic, signs, are, in, red, or, blue, simple, gold, and, black, roundels, mark, the, end, of, verses, and, headings, are, written, in, gold, kufic, inside, a, decorated, frame, and, background, 304, it, also, contains, a, frontispiece, of, relatively, simple, design, consisting, of, a, grid, of, lozenges, variously, filled, with, gold, vegetal, motifs, gold, netting, or, gold, kufic, inscriptions, on, red, or, blue, backgrounds, more, sophisticated, illumination, is, already, evident, in, a, copy, of, a, sahih, dated, to, 1120, during, the, reign, of, ali, ibn, yusuf, also, produced, in, either, the, maghreb, or, al, andalus, with, a, rich, frontispiece, centered, around, a, large, medallion, formed, by, an, interlacing, geometric, motif, filled, with, gold, backgrounds, and, vegetal, motifs, a, similarly, sophisticated, quran, dated, to, 1143, at, the, end, of, ali, ibn, yusuf, s, reign, and, produced, in, c, rdoba, contains, a, frontispiece, with, an, interlacing, geometric, motif, forming, a, panel, filled, with, gold, and, a, knotted, blue, roundel, at, the, middle, 304, the, almoravid, conquest, of, al, andalus, caused, a, temporary, rupture, in, ceramic, production, but, it, returned, in, the, 12th, century, there, is, a, collection, of, about, 2, 000, maghrebi, andalusi, ceramic, basins, or, bowls, bacini, in, pisa, where, they, were, used, to, decorate, churches, from, the, early, 11th, to, fifteenth, centuries, there, were, a, number, of, varieties, of, ceramics, under, the, almoravids, including, cuerda, seca, pieces, the, most, luxurious, form, was, iridescent, lustreware, made, by, applying, a, metallic, glaze, to, the, pieces, before, a, second, firing, this, technique, came, from, iraq, and, flourished, in, fatimid, egypt, the, almoravid, minbars, such, as, the, minbar, of, the, grand, mosque, of, marrakesh, commissioned, by, sultan, ali, ibn, yusuf, 1137, or, the, minbar, for, the, university, of, al, qarawiyyin, 1144, expressed, the, almoravids, maliki, legitimacy, their, inheritance, of, the, umayyad, imperial, role, and, the, extension, of, that, imperial, power, into, the, maghreb, both, minbars, are, exceptional, works, of, marquetry, and, woodcarving, decorated, with, geometric, compositions, inlaid, materials, and, arabesque, reliefs, the, almoravid, period, along, with, the, subsequent, almohad, period, is, considered, one, of, the, most, formative, stages, of, moroccan, and, moorish, architecture, establishing, many, of, the, forms, and, motifs, of, this, style, that, were, refined, in, subsequent, centuries, manuel, casamar, perez, remarks, that, the, almoravids, scaled, back, the, andalusi, trend, towards, heavier, and, more, elaborate, decoration, which, had, developed, since, the, caliphate, of, c, rdoba, and, instead, prioritized, a, greater, balance, between, proportions, and, ornamentation, the, two, centers, of, artistic, production, in, the, islamic, west, before, the, rise, of, the, almoravids, were, kairouan, and, c, rdoba, both, former, capitals, in, the, region, which, served, as, sources, of, inspiration, the, almoravids, were, responsible, for, establishing, a, new, imperial, capital, at, marrakesh, which, became, a, major, center, of, architectural, patronage, thereafter, the, almoravids, adopted, the, architectural, developments, of, al, andalus, such, as, the, complex, interlacing, arches, of, the, great, mosque, in, c, rdoba, and, of, the, aljaferia, palace, in, zaragoza, while, also, introducing, new, ornamental, techniques, from, the, east, such, as, muqarnas, stalactite, or, honeycomb, carvings, after, taking, control, of, al, andalus, in, the, battle, of, sagrajas, the, almoravids, sent, muslim, christian, and, jewish, artisans, from, iberia, to, north, africa, to, work, on, monuments, the, great, mosque, in, algiers, c, 1097, the, great, mosque, of,
