no, legislation, had, ever, been, passed, to, establish, slavery, in, england, the, case, received, national, attention, and, five, advocates, supported, the, action, on, behalf, of, somersett, in, his, judgement, of, 22, june, 1772, mansfield, declared, the, state, of, slavery, is, of, such, a, nature, that, it, is, incapable, of, being, introduced, on, any, reasons, moral, or, political, but, only, by, positive, law, which, preserves, its, force, long, after, the, reasons, occasions, and, time, itself, from, whence, it, was, created, is, erased, from, memory, it, is, so, odious, that, nothing, can, be, suffered, to, support, it, but, positive, law, whatever, inconveniences, therefore, may, follow, from, a, decision, i, cannot, say, this, case, is, allowed, or, approved, by, the, law, of, england, and, therefore, the, black, must, be, discharged, although, the, exact, legal, implications, of, the, judgement, are, unclear, when, analysed, by, lawyers, the, judgement, was, generally, taken, at, the, time, to, have, determined, that, slavery, did, not, exist, under, english, common, law, and, was, thus, prohibited, in, england, the, decision, did, not, apply, to, the, british, overseas, territories, by, then, for, example, the, american, colonies, had, established, slavery, by, positive, laws, somersett, s, case, became, a, significant, part, of, the, common, law, of, slavery, in, the, english, speaking, world, and, it, helped, launch, the, movement, to, abolish, slavery, after, reading, about, somersett, s, case, joseph, knight, an, enslaved, african, who, had, been, purchased, by, his, master, john, wedderburn, in, jamaica, and, brought, to, scotland, left, him, married, and, with, a, child, he, filed, a, freedom, suit, on, the, grounds, that, he, could, not, be, held, as, a, slave, in, great, britain, in, the, case, of, knight, v, wedderburn, 1778, wedderburn, said, that, knight, owed, him, perpetual, servitude, the, court, of, session, of, scotland, ruled, against, him, saying, that, chattel, slavery, was, not, recognized, under, the, law, of, scotland, and, slaves, could, seek, court, protection, to, leave, a, master, or, avoid, being, forcibly, removed, from, scotland, to, be, returned, to, slavery, in, the, colonies, but, at, the, same, time, legally, mandated, hereditary, slavery, of, scots, persons, in, scotland, had, existed, from, 1606, and, continued, until, 1799, when, colliers, and, salters, were, emancipated, by, an, act, of, the, parliament, of, great, britain, 39, geo, 3, c, 56, skilled, workers, they, were,

and, bondage, but, that, was, ineffective, necessitating, the, 1799, act, in, the, 1776, book, the, wealth, of, nations, adam, smith, argued, for, the, abolition, of, slavery, on, economic, grounds, smith, pointed, out, that, slavery, incurred, security, housing, and, food, costs, that, the, use, of, free, labour, would, not, and, opined, that, free, workers, would, be, more, productive, because, they, would, have, personal, economic, incentives, to, work, harder, the, death, rate, and, thus, repurchase, cost, of, slaves, was, also, high, and, people, are, less, productive, when, not, allowed, to, choose, the, type, of, work, they, prefer, are, illiterate, and, are, forced, to, live, and, work, in, miserable, and, unhealthy, conditions, the, free, labour, markets, and, international, free, trade, that, smith, preferred, would, also, result, in, different, prices, and, allocations, that, smith, believed, would, be, more, efficient, and, productive, for, consumers, prior, to, the, american, revolution, there, were, few, significant, initiatives, in, the, american, colonies, that, led, to, the, abolitionist, movement, some, quakers, were, active, benjamin, kent, was, the,

cause, of, abolition, through, the, parliamentary, campaign, thomas, clarkson, became, the, group, s, most, prominent, researcher, gathering, vast, amounts, of, data, on, the, trade, one, aspect, of, abolitionism, during, this, period, was, the, effective, use, of, images, such, as, the, famous, josiah, wedgwood, am, i, not, a, man, and, a, brother, anti, slavery, medallion, of, 1787, clarkson, described, the, medallion, as, promoting, the, cause, of, justice, humanity, and, freedom, the, 1792, slave, trade, bill, passed, the, house, of, commons, mangled, and, mutilated, by, the,

and, the, formation, of, the, free, methodist, church, by, benjamin, titus, roberts, in, 1860, which, is, reflected, in, the, name, of, church, in, the, 1850s, in, the, fifteen, states, constituting,

applied, to, religious, gatherings, of, free, blacks, and, slaves, these, laws, passed, around, the, 1820, 1850, period, were, blamed, in, the, south, on, northern, abolitionists, as, one, slaveowner, wrote, i, can, tell, you, it, was, the, abolition, agitation, if, the, slave, is, not, allowed, to, read, his, bible, the, sin, rests, upon, the, abolitionists, for, they, stand, prepared, to, furnish, him, with, a, key, to, it, which, would, make, it, not, a, book, of, hope, and, love, and, peace, but, of, despair, hatred, and, blood, which, would, convert, the, reader, not, into, a, christian, but, a, demon, allow, our, slaves, to, read, your, writings, stimulating, them, to, cut, our, throats, can, you, believe, us, to, be, such, unspeakable, fools, abolitionism, in, the, united, states, became, a, popular, expression, of, moralism, operating, in, tandem, with, other, social, reform, efforts, such, as, the, temperance, movement, and, much, more, problematically, the, women, s, suffrage, movement, the, white, abolitionist, movement, in, the, north, was, led, by, social, reformers, especially, william, lloyd, garrison, founder, of, the, american, anti, slavery, society, and, writers, wendell, phillips, john, greenleaf, whittier, and, harriet, beecher, stowe, black, activists, included, former, slaves, such, as, frederick, douglass, and, free, blacks, such, as, the, brothers, charles, henry, langston, and, john, mercer, langston, who, helped, found, the, ohio, anti, slavery, society, some, abolitionists, said, that, slavery, was, criminal, and, a, sin, they, also, criticized, slave, owners, of, using, black, women, as, concubines, and, taking, sexual, advantage, of, them, the, republican, party, wanted, to, achieve, the, gradual, extinction, of, slavery, by, market, forces, because, its, members, believed, that, free, labour, was, superior, to, slave, labour, white, southern, leaders, said, that, the, republican, policy, of, blocking, the, expansion, of, slavery, into, the, west, made, them, second, class, citizens, and, they, also, said, it, challenged, their, autonomy, with, the, 1860, presidential, victory, of, abraham, lincoln, seven, deep, south, states, whose, economy, was, based, on, cotton, and, the, labour, of, enslaved, people, decided, to, secede, and, form, a, new, nation, the, american, civil, war, broke, out, in, april, 1861, with, the, firing, on, fort, sumter, in, south, carolina, when, lincoln, called, for, troops, to, suppress, the, rebellion, four, more, slave, states, seceded, meanwhile, four, slave,

compensated, emancipation, act, abolishing, slavery, in, washington, d, c, meanwhile, the, union, suddenly, found, itself, dealing, with, a, steady, stream, of, escaped, slaves, from, the, south, rushing, to, union, lines, in, response, congress, passed, the, confiscation, acts, which, essentially, declared, escaped, slaves, from, the, south, to, be, confiscated, war, property, called, contrabands, so, that, they, would, not, be, returned, to, their, masters, in, the, confederacy, although, the, initial, act, did, not, mention, emancipation, the, second, confiscation, act, passed, on, 17, july, 1862, stated, that, escaped, or, liberated, slaves, belonging, to, anyone, who, participated, in, or, supported, the, rebellion, shall, be, deemed, captives, of, war, and, shall, be, forever, free, of, their, servitude, and, not, again, held, as, slaves, on, 1, january, 1863, lincoln, issued, the, emancipation, proclamation, which, was, an, executive, order, of, the, u, s, government, that, changed, the, legal, status, of, 3, million, slaves, in, the, confederacy, from, slave, to, henceforward, free, though, slaves, were, legally, freed, by, the, proclamation, they, became, actually, free, by, escaping, to, federal, lines, or, by, advances, of, federal, troops, even, before, the, emancipation, proclamation, many, former, slaves, served, the, federal, army, as, teamsters, cooks, laundresses, and, laborers, as, well, as, scouts, spies, and, guides, confederate, general, robert, lee, once, said, the, chief, source, of, information, to, the, enemy, is, through, our, negroes, the, emancipation, proclamation, however, provided, that, people, it, declared, to, be, free, who, were, of, suitable, condition, will, be, received, into, the, armed, service, of, the, united, states, and, the, united, states, colored, troops, were, formed, plantation, owners, sometimes, moved, the, black, people, they, claimed, to, own, as, far, as, possible, out, of, reach, of, the, union, army, by, juneteenth, 19, june, 1865, in, texas, the, union, army, controlled, all, of, the, confederacy, and, liberated, all, its, slaves, the, owners, were, never, compensated, nor, were, freed, slaves, compensated, by, former, owners, the, border, states, were, exempt, from, the, emancipation, proclamation, but, they, too, except, delaware, began, their, own, emancipation, programs, as, the, war, dragged, on, both, the, federal, government, and, union, states, continued, to, take, measures, against, slavery, in, june, 1864, the, fugitive, slave, act, of, 1850, which, required, free, states, to, aid, in, returning, escaped, slaves, to, slave, states, was, repealed, the, state, of, maryland, abolished, slavery, on, 13, october, 1864, missouri, abolished, slavery, on, 11, january, 1865, west, virginia, which, had, been, admitted, to, the, union, in, 1863, as, a, slave, state, but, on, the, condition, of, gradual, emancipation, fully, abolished, slavery, on, 3, february, 1865, the, 13th, amendment, to, the, u, s, constitution, took, effect, in, december, 1865, seven, months, after, the, end, of, the, war, and, finally, ended, slavery, for, non, criminals, throughout, the, united, states, it, also, abolished, slavery, among, the, indian, tribes, including, the, alaska, tribes, that, became, part, of, the, u, s, in, 1867, brazil, and, cuba, were, the, last, countries, in, the, western, world, to, abolish, slavery, with, brazil, being, the, last, in, 1888, while, actors, like, gertrudis, g, mez, de, avellaneda, in, brazil, and, adelina, charuteira, in, cuba, worked, to, end, slavery, it, was, enslaved, people, themselves, who, worked, daily, to, chip, away, at, enslavers, local, authority, these, actions, have, at, times, been, dismissed, because, they, were, small, actions, but, historian, adriana, chira, argues, that, while, these, freedoms, were, patchwork, often, incomplete, when, measured, against, liberal, abolitionist, yardsticks, precarious, and, even, reversible, the, action, were, very, concrete, and, in, the, long, term, they, served, to, corrode, the, legal, structures, of, plantation, slavery, locally, these, actions, included, marronage, and, maroon, societies, that, undermined, the, authority, of, enslavers, in, brazil, and, legal, challenges, relying, on, the, legal, history, of, spain, in, cuba, these, practices, are, regionally, specific, based, on, the, legal, customs, of, the, region, that, enslaved, people, knew, well, from, centuries, of, interactions, with, iberian, slave, laws, a, key, avenue, for, these, legal, arguments, was, the, prominence, of, lo, extrajudicial, a, field, of, legal, interactions, adjacent, to, a, lawsuit, explained, by, historian, bianca, premo, as, consisting, of, out, of, court, settlements, public, revelations, and, face, to, face, encounters, chira, 29, the, suffering, of, women, in, slavery, was, a, common, trope, consistently, used, in, abolitionists, rhetoric, on, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, this, was, especially, true, as, it, relates, to, the, image, of, suffering, mothers, and, their, children, towards, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, as, slavery, was, coming, to, an, end, throughout, the, atlantic, world, images, appearing, in, abolitionist, publications, routinely, included, images, of, families, being, torn, apart, and, pregnant, women, being, forced, to, do, hard, labor, as, countries, imposed, free, womb, laws, to, soften, the, image, of, slavery, and, bring, about, gradual, emancipation, for, many, it, raised, the, question, of, the, justice, of, women, being, used, to, carry, out, emancipation, without, benefiting, from, it, themselves, speeches, given, on, the, topic, at, the, time, focused, on, mothers, and, compared, them, to, all, other, mothers, using, motherhood, to, level, the, subjects, and, objects, of, their, speech, women, were, also, often, on, the, forefront, of, the, abolition, movement, authors, such, as, harriet, beecher, stowe, united, states, and, gertrudis, g, mez, de, avellaneda, brazil, used, their, novels, to, call, into, question, the, humanity, of, slavery, women, such, as, the, grimk, sisters, abigail, adams, elizabeth, cady, stanton, and, others, used, their, connections, to, political, movements, to, advocate, for, the, abolition, of, slavery, enslaved, women, such, as, phillis, wheatley, and, harriet, tubman, took, matters, into, their, own, hands, by, challenging, the, institution, of, slavery, through, their, writing, and, their, actions, in, countries, like, cuba, and, brazil, where, many, enslaved, women, in, urban, areas, were, close, to, the, governmental, apparatuses, needed, to, challenge, slavery, they, often, used, this, proximity, to, pay, for, their, and, their, families, freedom, and, argued, before, colonial, courts, for, their, freedom, with, increasing, success, as, the, nineteenth, century, progressed, enslaved, women, like, adelina, charuteira, used, their, mobility, as, street, vendors, and, as, much, access, as, they, had, to, literacy, to, spread, information, about, abolition, between, freedom, seeking, people, and, local, abolitionist, networks, white, and, black, opponents, of, slavery, who, played, a, considerable, role, in, the, movement, this, list, includes, some, escaped, slaves, who, were, traditionally, called, abolitionists, the, first, international, attempt, to, address, the, abolition, of, slavery, was, the, world, anti, slavery, convention, organised, by, the, british, and, foreign, anti, slavery, society, at, exeter, hall, in, london, on, 12, 23, june, 1840, this, was, however, an, attempt, made, by, ngos, not, by, state, and, governments, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, issue, was, addressed, on, an, international, level, by, states, and, governments, the, brussels, anti, slavery, conference, 1889, 90, addressed, slavery, on, a, semi, global, level, via, the, representatives,

and, progressive, constitutionalism, this, vision, is, interdisciplinary, and, finds, its, roots, in, the, anti, slavery, movement, in, the, united, states, of, america, and, is, largely, based, on, the, tenet, that, current, state, institutions, particularly, the, carceral, system, is, rooted, in, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, some, constitutional, abolitionists, critique, the, claim, that, the, constitution, was, pro, slavery, radical, abolitionist, constitutionalism, calls, for, the, idea, of, dignity, and, the, use, of, jurisprudence, to, address, social, inequalities, whereas, the, original, u, s, constitution, was, pro, slavery, the, reconstruction, amendments, can, be, seen, as, a, compromise, for, freedom, without, allowing, for, the, full, abolition, criminal, punishment, was, a, major, way, that, southern, states, maintained, the, exploitation, of, black, labour, and, effectively, nullified, the, reconstruction, amendments, this, was, done, namely, through, black, codes, harsh, vagrancy, laws, apprenticeship, laws, and, extreme, punishment, for, black, people, the, reconstruction, amendments, in, their, aim, to, promote, citizenship, and, emancipation, are, believed, by, these, thinkers, to, still, be, guiding, principles, in, the, fight, for, freedom, and, abolition, there, are, suggestions, that, a, broad, reading, of, the, thirteenth, amendment, can, convey, an, abolitionist, vision, of, the, freedom, advocated, for, by, black, people, in, the, public, sphere, beyond, emancipation, section, one, of, the, fourteenth, amendment, was, used, by, many, abolitionist, lawyers, and, activists, throughout, the, north, to, advance, the, case, against, slavery, proponents, of, abolitionist, constitutionalism, believe, the, thirteenth, and, fourteenth, amendments, can, be, used, today, to, extend, the, abolitionist, logics, to, the, various, current, barriers, to, injustices, that, are, faced, by, marginalized, peoples, just, like, abolitionism, more, generally, abolitionist, constitutionalism, seeks, to, provide, a, vision, which, will, lead, to, the, abolition, of, many, different, neoliberal, state, institutions, such, as, the, prison, industrial, complex, the, wage, system, and, policing, this, is, tied, to, a, belief, that, white, supremacy, is, woven, into, the, fabric, of, legal, state, institutions, radical, abolitionists, are, often, marginalized, there, is, a, belief, that, constitutionalism, as, a, main, tenet, of, radical, abolitionism, can, change, and, appeal, to, the, popular, opinion, more, historically, slavery, abolitionists, have, had, to, use, the, public, meaning, of, constitutional, terms, in, order, in, their, fight, against, slavery, constitutional, abolitionists, are, generally, in, favour, of, incremental, changes, that, follow, the, principles, of, the, reconstructive, amendments, there, are, debates, among, abolitionists, where, some, claim, that, the, constitution, ought, not, to, be, treated, as, an, abolitionist, text, as, it, is, rather, used, as, a, legal, tool, by, the, state, to, deny, freedoms, to, marginalized, communities, and, that, contemporary, abolitionist, work, cannot, be, done, by, relying, on, the, constitutional, texts, some, argue, that, the, narrative, and, scholarly, literature, around, reconstruction, amendments, is, not, coherent, regarding, their, original, aims, on, 10, december, 1948, the, general, assembly, of, the, united, nations, adopted, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, article, 4, states, no, one, shall, be, held, in,
