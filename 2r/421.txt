parliamentarian, victory, 1643, 1644, 1645, 1646, england, the, english, civil, war, was, a, series, of, civil, wars, and, political, machinations, between, royalists, and, parliamentarians, in, the, kingdom, of, england, from, 1642, to, 1651, part, of, the, wider, 1639, to, 1653, wars, of, the, three, kingdoms, the, struggle, consisted, of, the, first, english, civil, war, and, the, second, english, civil, war, the, anglo, scottish, war, of, 1650, to, 1652, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, third, english, civil, war, while, the, conflicts, in, the, three, kingdoms, of, england, scotland, and, ireland, had, similarities, each, had, their, own, specific, issues, and, objectives, the, first, english, civil, war, was, fought, primarily, over, the, correct, balance, of, power, between, parliament, and, charles, i, it, ended, in, june, 1646, with, royalist, defeat, and, the, king, in, custody, however, victory, exposed, parliamentarian, divisions, over, the, nature, of, the, political, settlement, the, vast, majority, went, to, war, in, 1642, to, assert, parliament, s, right, to, participate, in, government, not, abolish, the, monarchy, which, meant, charles, refusal, to, make, concessions, led, to, a, stalemate, concern, over, the, political, influence, of, radicals, within, the, new, model, army, like, oliver, cromwell, led, to, an, alliance, between, moderate, parliamentarians, and, royalists, supported, by, the, covenanters, royalist, defeat, in, the, 1648, second, english, civil, war, resulted, in, the, execution, of, charles, i, in, january, 1649, and, establishment, of, the, commonwealth, of, england, in, 1650, charles, ii, was, crowned, king, of, scotland, in, return, for, agreeing, to, create, a, presbyterian, church, in, both, england, and, scotland, the, subsequent, anglo, scottish, war, ended, with, parliamentarian, victory, at, worcester, on, 3, september, 1651, both, ireland, and, scotland, were, incorporated, into, the, commonwealth, and, britain, became, a, unitary, state, until, the, stuart, restoration, in, 1660, the, term, english, civil, war, appears, most, often, in, the, singular, but, historians, often, divide, the, conflict, into, two, or, three, separate, wars, they, were, not, restricted, to, england, alone, as, wales, having, been, annexed, into, the, kingdom, of, england, was, affected, by, the, same, political, instabilities, the, conflicts, also, involved, wars, with, scotland, and, ireland, and, civil, wars, within, them, some, historians, have, favoured, the, term, the, british, civil, wars, from, the, restoration, to, the, 19th, century, the, common, phrase, for, the, civil, wars, was, the, rebellion, or, the, great, rebellion, the, wars, spanning, all, four, countries, are, known, as, the, wars, of, the, three, kingdoms, in, the, early, 19th, century, sir, walter, scott, referred, to, it, as, the, great, civil, war, the, 1911, encyclop, dia, britannica, called, the, series, of, conflicts, the, great, rebellion, some, historians, notably, marxists, such, as, christopher, hill, 1912, 2003, favoured, the, term, english, revolution, each, side, had, a, geographical, stronghold, such, that, minority, elements, were, silenced, or, fled, the, royalist, areas, included, the, countryside, the, shires, the, cathedral, city, of, oxford, and, the, less, economically, developed, areas, of, northern, and, western, england, parliament, s, strengths, spanned, the, industrial, centres, ports, and, economically, advanced, regions, of, southern, and, eastern, england, including, the, remaining, cathedral, cities, except, york, chester, worcester, lacey, baldwin, smith, says, the, words, populous, rich, and, rebellious, seemed, to, go, hand, in, hand, many, officers, and, veteran, soldiers, had, fought, in, european, wars, notably, the, eighty, years, war, between, the, spanish, and, the, dutch, which, began, in, 1568, as, well, as, earlier, phases, of, the, thirty, years, war, which, began, in, 1618, and, concluded, in, 1648, the, war, was, of, unprecedented, scale, for, the, english, during, the, campaign, seasons, 120, 000, to, 150, 000, soldiers, would, be, in, the, field, a, higher, proportion, of, the, population, than, were, fighting, in, germany, in, the, thirty, years, war, the, main, battle, tactic, came, to, be, known, as, pike, and, shot, infantry, the, two, sides, would, line, up, opposite, one, another, with, infantry, brigades, of, musketeers, in, the, centre, these, carried, matchlock, muskets, an, inaccurate, weapon, which, nevertheless, could, be, lethal, at, a, range, of, up, to, 300, yards, musketeers, would, assemble, three, rows, deep, the, first, kneeling, second, crouching, and, third, standing, at, times, troops, divided, into, two, groups, allowing, one, to, reload, while, the, other, fired, among, the, musketeers, were, pike, men, carrying, pikes, of, 12, feet, 4, m, to, 18, feet, 5, 5, m, long, whose, main, purpose, was, to, protect, the, musketeers, from, cavalry, charges, positioned, on, each, side, of, the, infantry, were, cavalry, with, a, right, wing, led, by, the, lieutenant, general, and, left, by, the, commissary, general, its, main, aim, was, to, rout, the, opponents, cavalry, then, turn, and, overpower, their, infantry, the, royalist, cavaliers, skill, and, speed, on, horseback, led, to, many, early, victories, prince, rupert, commanding, the, king, s, cavalry, used, a, tactic, learned, while, fighting, in, the, dutch, army, where, cavalry, would, charge, at, full, speed, into, the, opponent, s, infantry, firing, their, pistols, just, before, impact, however, with, oliver, cromwell, and, the, introduction, of, the, more, disciplined, new, model, army, a, group, of, disciplined, pike, men, would, stand, its, ground, which, could, have, a, devastating, effect, the, royalist, cavalry, had, a, tendency, to, chase, down, individual, targets, after, the, initial, charge, leaving, their, forces, scattered, and, tired, whereas, cromwell, s, cavalry, was, slower, but, better, disciplined, trained, to, operate, as, a, single, unit, it, went, on, to, win, many, decisive, victories, the, english, civil, war, broke, out, in, 1642, less, than, 40, years, after, the, death, of, queen, elizabeth, i, elizabeth, had, been, succeeded, by, her, first, cousin, twice, removed, king, james, vi, of, scotland, as, james, i, of, england, creating, the, first, personal, union, of, the, scottish, and, english, kingdoms, as, king, of, scots, james, had, become, accustomed, to, scotland, s, weak, parliamentary, tradition, since, assuming, control, of, the, scottish, government, in, 1583, so, that, upon, assuming, power, south, of, the, border, the, new, king, of, england, was, affronted, by, the, constraints, the, english, parliament, attempted, to, place, on, him, in, exchange, for, money, consequently, james, s, personal, extravagance, which, resulted, in, his, being, perennially, short, of, money, meant, that, he, had, to, resort, to, extra, parliamentary, sources, of, income, moreover, increasing, inflation, during, this, period, meant, that, even, though, parliament, was, granting, the, king, the, same, nominal, value, of, subsidy, the, income, was, actually, worth, less, this, extravagance, was, tempered, by, james, s, peaceful, disposition, so, that, by, the, succession, of, his, son, charles, i, in, 1625, the, two, kingdoms, had, both, experienced, relative, peace, internally, and, in, their, relations, with, each, other, charles, followed, his, father, s, dream, in, hoping, to, unite, the, kingdoms, of, england, scotland, and, ireland, into, a, single, kingdom, many, english, parliamentarians, were, suspicious, of, such, a, move, fearing, that, such, a, new, kingdom, might, destroy, old, english, traditions, that, had, bound, the, english, monarchy, because, james, had, described, kings, as, little, gods, on, earth, chosen, by, god, to, rule, in, accordance, with, the, doctrine, of, the, divine, right, of, kings, and, charles, shared, his, father, s, position, the, suspicions, of, the, parliamentarians, had, some, justification, at, the, time, the, parliament, of, england, did, not, have, a, large, permanent, role, in, the, english, system, of, government, instead, it, functioned, as, a, temporary, advisory, committee, and, was, summoned, only, if, and, when, the, monarch, saw, fit, once, summoned, a, parliament, s, continued, existence, was, at, the, king, s, pleasure, since, it, was, subject, to, dissolution, by, him, at, any, time, yet, in, spite, of, this, limited, role, parliament, had, acquired, over, the, centuries, de, facto, powers, of, enough, significance, that, monarchs, could, not, simply, ignore, them, indefinitely, for, a, monarch, parliament, s, most, indispensable, power, was, its, ability, to, raise, tax, revenues, far, in, excess, of, all, other, sources, of, revenue, at, the, crown, s, disposal, by, the, 17th, century, parliament, s, tax, raising, powers, had, come, to, be, derived, from, the, fact, that, the, gentry, was, the, only, stratum, of, society, with, the, ability, and, authority, to, collect, and, remit, the, most, meaningful, forms, of, taxation, then, available, at, the, local, level, so, if, the, king, wanted, to, ensure, smooth, revenue, collection, he, needed, the, gentry, s, cooperation, for, all, of, the, crown, s, legal, authority, its, resources, were, limited, by, any, modern, standard, to, the, extent, that, if, the, gentry, refused, to, collect, the, king, s, taxes, on, a, national, scale, the, crown, lacked, a, practical, means, of, compelling, them, from, the, thirteenth, century, monarchs, ordered, the, election, of, representatives, to, sit, in, the, house, of, commons, with, most, voters, being, the, owners, of, property, although, in, some, potwalloper, boroughs, every, male, householder, could, vote, when, assembled, along, with, the, house, of, lords, these, elected, representatives, formed, a, parliament, so, the, concept, of, parliaments, allowed, representatives, of, the, property, owning, class, to, meet, primarily, at, least, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, monarch, to, sanction, whatever, taxes, the, monarch, wished, to, collect, in, the, process, the, representatives, could, debate, and, enact, statutes, or, acts, however, parliament, lacked, the, power, to, force, its, will, upon, the, monarch, its, only, leverage, was, the, threat, of, withholding, the, financial, means, required, to, implement, his, plans, many, concerns, were, raised, over, charles, s, marriage, in, 1625, to, a, roman, catholic, french, princess, henrietta, maria, parliament, refused, to, assign, him, the, traditional, right, to, collect, customs, duties, for, his, entire, reign, deciding, instead, to, grant, it, only, on, a, provisional, basis, and, negotiate, with, him, charles, meanwhile, decided, to, send, an, expeditionary, force, to, relieve, the, french, huguenots, whom, french, royal, troops, held, besieged, in, la, rochelle, such, military, support, for, protestants, on, the, continent, potentially, alleviated, concerns, about, the, king, s, marriage, to, a, catholic, however, charles, s, insistence, on, giving, command, of, the, english, force, to, his, unpopular, royal, favourite, george, villiers, the, duke, of, buckingham, undermined, that, support, unfortunately, for, charles, and, buckingham, the, relief, expedition, proved, a, fiasco, 1627, and, parliament, already, hostile, to, buckingham, for, his, monopoly, on, royal, patronage, opened, impeachment, proceedings, against, him, charles, responded, by, dissolving, parliament, this, saved, buckingham, but, confirmed, the, impression, that, charles, wanted, to, avoid, parliamentary, scrutiny, of, his, ministers, having, dissolved, parliament, and, unable, to, raise, money, without, it, the, king, assembled, a, new, one, in, 1628, the, elected, members, included, oliver, cromwell, john, hampden, and, edward, coke, the, new, parliament, drew, up, a, petition, of, right, which, charles, accepted, as, a, concession, to, obtain, his, subsidy, the, petition, made, reference, to, magna, carta, but, did, not, grant, him, the, right, of, tonnage, and, poundage, which, charles, had, been, collecting, without, parliamentary, authorisation, since, 1625, several, more, active, members, of, the, opposition, were, imprisoned, which, caused, outrage, one, john, eliot, subsequently, died, in, prison, and, came, to, be, seen, as, a, martyr, for, the, rights, of, parliament, charles, avoided, calling, a, parliament, for, the, next, decade, a, period, known, as, the, personal, rule, of, charles, i, or, by, its, critics, as, the, eleven, years, tyranny, during, this, period, charles, s, policies, were, determined, by, his, lack, of, money, first, and, foremost, to, avoid, parliament, the, king, needed, to, avoid, war, charles, made, peace, with, france, and, spain, effectively, ending, england, s, involvement, in, the, thirty, years, war, however, that, in, itself, was, far, from, enough, to, balance, the, crown, s, finances, unable, to, raise, revenue, without, parliament, and, unwilling, to, convene, it, charles, resorted, to, other, means, one, was, to, revive, conventions, often, outdated, for, example, a, failure, to, attend, and, receive, knighthood, at, charles, s, coronation, became, a, finable, offence, with, the, fine, paid, to, the, crown, the, king, also, tried, to, raise, revenue, through, ship, money, demanding, in, 1634, 1636, that, the, inland, english, counties, pay, a, tax, for, the, royal, navy, to, counter, the, threat, of, privateers, and, pirates, in, the, english, channel, established, law, supported, the, policy, of, coastal, counties, and, inland, ports, such, as, london, paying, ship, money, in, times, of, need, but, it, had, not, been, applied, to, inland, counties, before, authorities, had, ignored, it, for, centuries, and, many, saw, it, as, yet, another, extra, parliamentary, illegal, tax, which, prompted, some, prominent, men, to, refuse, to, pay, it, charles, issued, a, writ, against, john, hampden, for, his, failure, to, pay, and, although, five, judges, including, sir, george, croke, supported, hampden, seven, judges, found, in, favour, of, the, king, in, 1638, the, fines, imposed, on, people, who, refused, to, pay, ship, money, and, standing, out, against, its, illegality, aroused, widespread, indignation, during, his, personal, rule, charles, aroused, most, antagonism, through, his, religious, measures, he, believed, in, high, anglicanism, a, sacramental, version, of, the, church, of, england, theologically, based, upon, arminianism, a, creed, shared, with, his, main, political, adviser, archbishop, william, laud, in, 1633, charles, appointed, laud, archbishop, of, canterbury, and, started, making, the, church, more, ceremonial, replacing, the, wooden, communion, tables, with, stone, altars, puritans, accused, laud, of, reintroducing, catholicism, and, when, they, complained, he, had, them, arrested, in, 1637, john, bastwick, henry, burton, and, william, prynne, had, their, ears, cut, off, for, writing, pamphlets, attacking, laud, s, views, a, rare, penalty, for, gentlemen, and, one, that, aroused, anger, moreover, the, church, authorities, revived, statutes, from, the, time, of, elizabeth, i, about, church, attendance, and, fined, puritans, for, not, attending, anglican, services, the, end, of, charles, s, independent, governance, came, when, he, attempted, to, apply, the, same, religious, policies, in, scotland, the, church, of, scotland, reluctantly, episcopal, in, structure, had, independent, traditions, charles, wanted, one, uniform, church, throughout, britain, and, introduced, a, new, high, anglican, version, of, the, english, book, of, common, prayer, to, scotland, in, the, middle, of, 1637, this, was, violently, resisted, a, riot, broke, out, in, edinburgh, which, may, have, been, started, in, st, giles, cathedral, according, to, legend, by, jenny, geddes, in, february, 1638, the, scots, formulated, their, objections, to, royal, policy, in, the, national, covenant, this, document, took, the, form, of, a, loyal, protest, rejecting, all, innovations, not, first, tested, by, free, parliaments, and, general, assemblies, of, the, church, in, the, spring, of, 1639, king, charles, i, accompanied, his, forces, to, the, scottish, border, to, end, the, rebellion, known, as, the, bishops, war, but, after, an, inconclusive, campaign, he, accepted, the, offered, scottish, truce, the, pacification, of, berwick, this, truce, proved, temporary, and, a, second, war, followed, in, mid, 1640, a, scots, army, defeated, charles, s, forces, in, the, north, then, captured, newcastle, charles, eventually, agreed, not, to, interfere, in, scotland, s, religion, charles, needed, to, suppress, the, rebellion, in, scotland, but, had, insufficient, funds, to, do, so, he, needed, to, seek, money, from, a, newly, elected, english, parliament, in, 1640, its, majority, faction, led, by, john, pym, used, this, appeal, for, money, as, a, chance, to, discuss, grievances, against, the, crown, and, oppose, the, idea, of, an, english, invasion, of, scotland, charles, took, exception, to, this, l, se, majest, offense, against, the, ruler, and, after, negotiations, went, nowhere, dissolved, the, parliament, after, only, a, few, weeks, hence, its, name, the, short, parliament, without, parliament, s, support, charles, attacked, scotland, again, breaking, the, truce, at, berwick, and, suffered, comprehensive, defeat, the, scots, went, on, to, invade, england, occupying, northumberland, and, durham, meanwhile, another, of, charles, s, chief, advisers, thomas, wentworth, 1st, viscount, wentworth, had, risen, to, the, role, of, lord, deputy, of, ireland, in, 1632, and, brought, in, much, needed, revenue, for, charles, by, persuading, the, irish, catholic, gentry, to, pay, new, taxes, in, return, for, promised, religious, concessions, in, 1639, charles, had, recalled, wentworth, to, england, and, in, 1640, made, him, earl, of, strafford, attempting, to, have, him, achieve, similar, results, in, scotland, this, time, he, proved, less, successful, and, the, english, forces, fled, the, field, at, their, second, encounter, with, the, scots, in, 1640, almost, the, whole, of, northern, england, was, occupied, and, charles, forced, to, pay, 850, per, day, to, keep, the, scots, from, advancing, had, he, not, done, so, they, would, have, pillaged, and, burnt, the, cities, and, towns, of, northern, england, all, this, put, charles, in, a, desperate, financial, state, as, king, of, scots, he, had, to, find, money, to, pay, the, scottish, army, in, england, as, king, of, england, he, had, to, find, money, to, pay, and, equip, an, english, army, to, defend, england, his, means, of, raising, english, revenue, without, an, english, parliament, fell, critically, short, of, achieving, this, against, this, backdrop, and, according, to, advice, from, the, magnum, concilium, the, house, of, lords, but, without, the, commons, so, not, a, parliament, charles, finally, bowed, to, pressure, and, summoned, another, english, parliament, in, november, 1640, the, new, parliament, proved, even, more, hostile, to, charles, than, its, predecessor, it, immediately, began, to, discuss, grievances, against, him, and, his, government, with, pym, and, hampden, of, ship, money, fame, in, the, lead, they, took, the, opportunity, presented, by, the, king, s, troubles, to, force, various, reforming, measures, including, many, with, strong, anti, papist, themes, upon, him, the, members, passed, a, law, stating, that, a, new, parliament, would, convene, at, least, once, every, three, years, without, the, king, s, summons, if, need, be, other, laws, passed, making, it, illegal, for, the, king, to, impose, taxes, without, parliamentary, consent, and, later, gave, parliament, control, over, the, king, s, ministers, finally, the, parliament, passed, a, law, forbidding, the, king, to, dissolve, it, without, its, consent, even, if, the, three, years, were, up, these, laws, equated, to, a, tremendous, increase, in, parliamentary, power, ever, since, this, parliament, has, been, known, as, the, long, parliament, however, parliament, did, attempt, to, avert, conflict, by, requiring, all, adults, to, sign, the, protestation, an, oath, of, allegiance, to, charles, early, in, the, long, parliament, the, house, overwhelmingly, accused, thomas, wentworth, earl, of, strafford, of, high, treason, and, other, crimes, and, misdemeanors, henry, vane, the, younger, supplied, evidence, of, strafford, s, claimed, improper, use, of, the, army, in, ireland, alleging, that, he, had, encouraged, the, king, to, use, his, ireland, raised, forces, to, threaten, england, into, compliance, this, evidence, was, obtained, from, vane, s, father, henry, vane, the, elder, a, member, of, the, king, s, privy, council, who, refused, to, confirm, it, in, parliament, out, of, loyalty, to, charles, on, 10, april, 1641, pym, s, case, collapsed, but, pym, made, a, direct, appeal, to, the, younger, vane, to, produce, a, copy, of, the, notes, from, the, king, s, privy, council, discovered, by, the, younger, vane, and, secretly, turned, over, to, pym, to, the, great, anguish, of, the, elder, vane, these, notes, contained, evidence, that, strafford, had, told, the, king, sir, you, have, done, your, duty, and, your, subjects, have, failed, in, theirs, and, therefore, you, are, absolved, from, the, rules, of, government, and, may, supply, yourself, by, extraordinary, ways, you, have, an, army, in, ireland, with, which, you, may, reduce, the, kingdom, pym, immediately, launched, a, bill, of, attainder, stating, strafford, s, guilt, and, demanding, that, he, be, put, to, death, unlike, a, guilty, verdict, in, a, court, case, attainder, did, not, require, a, legal, burden, of, proof, to, be, met, but, it, did, require, the, king, s, approval, charles, however, guaranteed, strafford, that, he, would, not, sign, the, attainder, without, which, the, bill, could, not, be, passed, furthermore, the, lords, opposed, the, severity, of, a, death, sentence, on, strafford, yet, increased, tensions, and, a, plot, in, the, army, to, support, strafford, began, to, sway, the, issue, on, 21, april, the, commons, passed, the, bill, 204, in, favour, 59, opposed, and, 250, abstained, and, the, lords, acquiesced, charles, still, incensed, over, the, commons, handling, of, buckingham, refused, his, assent, strafford, himself, hoping, to, head, off, the, war, he, saw, looming, wrote, to, the, king, and, asked, him, to, reconsider, charles, fearing, for, the, safety, of, his, family, signed, on, 10, may, strafford, was, beheaded, two, days, later, in, the, meantime, both, parliament, and, the, king, agreed, to, an, independent, investigation, into, the, king, s, involvement, in, strafford, s, plot, the, long, parliament, then, passed, the, triennial, act, 1640, also, known, as, the, dissolution, act, in, may, 1641, to, which, royal, assent, was, readily, granted, the, triennial, act, required, parliament, to, be, summoned, at, least, once, in, three, years, when, the, king, failed, to, issue, a, proper, summons, the, members, could, assemble, on, their, own, this, act, also, forbade, ship, money, without, parliament, s, consent, fines, in, distraint, of, knighthood, and, forced, loans, monopolies, were, cut, back, sharply, the, courts, of, the, star, chamber, and, high, commission, abolished, by, the, habeas, corpus, act, 1640, and, the, triennial, act, respectively, all, remaining, forms, of, taxation, were, legalised, and, regulated, by, the, tonnage, and, poundage, act, 1640, on, 3, may, parliament, decreed, the, protestation, attacking, the, wicked, counsels, of, charles, s, government, whereby, those, who, signed, the, petition, undertook, to, defend, the, true, reformed, religion, parliament, and, the, king, s, person, honour, and, estate, throughout, may, the, house, of, commons, launched, several, bills, attacking, bishops, and, episcopalianism, in, general, each, time, defeated, in, the, lords, charles, and, his, parliament, hoped, that, the, execution, of, strafford, and, the, protestation, would, end, the, drift, towards, war, but, in, fact, they, encouraged, it, charles, and, his, supporters, continued, to, resent, parliament, s, demands, and, parliamentarians, continued, to, suspect, charles, of, wanting, to, impose, episcopalianism, and, unfettered, royal, rule, by, military, force, within, months, the, irish, catholics, fearing, a, resurgence, of, protestant, power, struck, first, and, all, ireland, soon, descended, into, chaos, rumours, circulated, that, the, king, supported, the, irish, and, puritan, members, of, the, commons, soon, started, murmuring, that, this, exemplified, the, fate, that, charles, had, in, store, for, them, all, on, 4, january, 1642, charles, followed, by, 400, soldiers, entered, the, house, of, commons, and, attempted, to, arrest, five, members, on, a, charge, of, treason, the, members, had, learned, that, he, was, coming, and, escaped, charles, not, only, failed, to, arrest, them, but, turned, more, people, against, him, in, the, summer, of, 1642, these, national, troubles, helped, to, polarise, opinion, ending, indecision, about, which, side, to, support, or, what, action, to, take, opposition, to, charles, also, arose, from, many, local, grievances, for, example, imposed, drainage, schemes, in, the, fens, disrupted, the, livelihood, of, thousands, after, the, king, awarded, a, number, of, drainage, contracts, many, saw, the, king, as, indifferent, to, public, welfare, and, this, played, a, role, in, bringing, much, of, eastern, england, into, the, parliamentarian, camp, this, sentiment, brought, with, it, such, people, as, the, earl, of, manchester, and, oliver, cromwell, each, a, notable, wartime, adversary, of, the, king, conversely, one, of, the, leading, drainage, contractors, the, earl, of, lindsey, was, to, die, fighting, for, the, king, at, the, battle, of, edgehill, in, early, january, 1642, a, few, days, after, failing, to, capture, five, members, of, the, house, of, commons, charles, feared, for, the, safety, of, his, family, and, retinue, and, left, the, london, area, for, the, north, country, further, frequent, negotiations, by, letter, between, the, king, and, the, long, parliament, through, to, early, summer, proved, fruitless, on, 1, june, 1642, the, english, lords, and, commons, approved, a, list, of, proposals, known, as, the, nineteen, propositions, in, these, demands, the, parliament, sought, a, larger, share, of, power, in, the, governance, of, the, kingdom, before, the, end, of, the, month, the, king, rejected, the, propositions, as, the, summer, progressed, cities, and, towns, declared, their, sympathies, for, one, faction, or, the, other, for, example, the, garrison, of, portsmouth, commanded, by, sir, george, goring, declared, for, the, king, but, when, charles, tried, to, acquire, arms, from, kingston, upon, hull, the, weaponry, depository, used, in, the, previous, scottish, campaigns, sir, john, hotham, the, military, governor, appointed, by, parliament, in, january, refused, to, let, charles, enter, the, town, and, when, charles, returned, with, more, men, later, hotham, drove, them, off, charles, issued, a, warrant, for, hotham, s, arrest, as, a, traitor, but, was, powerless, to, enforce, it, throughout, the, summer, tensions, rose, and, there, was, brawling, in, several, places, the, first, death, from, the, conflict, taking, place, in, manchester, at, the, outset, of, the, conflict, much, of, the, country, remained, neutral, though, the, royal, navy, and, most, english, cities, favoured, parliament, while, the, king, found, marked, support, in, rural, communities, the, war, quickly, spread, and, eventually, involved, every, level, of, society, many, areas, attempted, to, remain, neutral, some, formed, bands, of, clubmen, to, protect, their, localities, from, the, worst, excesses, of, the, armies, of, both, sides, but, most, found, it, impossible, to, withstand, both, king, and, parliament, on, one, side, the, king, and, his, supporters, fought, for, traditional, government, in, church, and, state, on, the, other, most, parliamentarians, initially, took, up, arms, to, defend, what, they, saw, as, a, traditional, balance, of, government, in, church, and, state, which, the, bad, advice, the, king, received, from, his, advisers, had, undermined, before, and, during, the, eleven, years, tyranny, the, views, of, the, members, of, parliament, ranged, from, unquestioning, support, of, the, king, at, one, point, during, the, first, civil, war, more, members, of, the, commons, and, lords, gathered, in, the, king, s, oxford, parliament, than, at, westminster, through, to, radicals, who, sought, major, reforms, in, religious, independence, and, redistribution, of, power, at, a, national, level, after, the, debacle, at, hull, charles, moved, on, to, nottingham, raising, the, royal, standard, there, on, 22, august, 1642, at, the, time, charles, had, with, him, about, 2, 000, cavalry, and, a, small, number, of, yorkshire, infantrymen, and, using, the, archaic, system, of, a, commission, of, array, his, supporters, started, to, build, a, larger, army, around, the, standard, charles, moved, in, a, westerly, direction, first, to, stafford, then, on, to, shrewsbury, as, support, for, his, cause, seemed, particularly, strong, in, the, severn, valley, area, and, in, north, wales, while, passing, through, wellington, he, declared, in, what, became, known, as, the, wellington, declaration, that, he, would, uphold, the, protestant, religion, the, laws, of, england, and, the, liberty, of, parliament, the, parliamentarians, who, opposed, the, king, did, not, remain, passive, in, this, pre, war, period, as, in, hull, they, took, measures, to, secure, strategic, towns, and, cities, by, appointing, to, office, men, sympathetic, to, their, cause, on, 9, june, they, voted, to, raise, an, army, of, 10, 000, volunteers, and, appointed, robert, devereux, 3rd, earl, of, essex, its, commander, three, days, later, he, received, orders, to, rescue, his, majesty, s, person, and, the, persons, of, the, prince, and, the, duke, of, york, out, of, the, hands, of, those, desperate, persons, who, were, about, them, the, lords, lieutenant, whom, parliament, appointed, used, the, militia, ordinance, to, order, the, militia, to, join, essex, s, army, two, weeks, after, the, king, had, raised, his, standard, at, nottingham, essex, led, his, army, north, towards, northampton, picking, up, support, along, the, way, including, a, detachment, of, huntingdonshire, cavalry, raised, and, commanded, by, oliver, cromwell, by, mid, september, essex, s, forces, had, grown, to, 21, 000, infantry, and, 4, 200, cavalry, and, dragoons, on, 14, september, he, moved, his, army, to, coventry, and, then, to, the, north, of, the, cotswolds, a, strategy, that, placed, it, between, the, royalists, and, london, with, the, size, of, both, armies, now, in, the, tens, of, thousands, and, only, worcestershire, between, them, it, was, inevitable, that, cavalry, reconnaissance, units, would, meet, sooner, or, later, this, happened, in, the, first, major, skirmish, of, the, civil, war, when, a, troop, of, about, 1, 000, royalist, cavalry, under, prince, rupert, a, german, nephew, of, the, king, and, one, of, the, outstanding, cavalry, commanders, of, the, war, defeated, a, parliamentary, cavalry, detachment, under, colonel, john, brown, at, the, battle, of, powick, bridge, which, crossed, the, river, teme, close, to, worcester, rupert, withdrew, to, shrewsbury, where, a, council, of, war, discussed, two, courses, of, action, whether, to, advance, towards, essex, s, new, position, near, worcester, or, march, down, the, now, open, road, towards, london, the, council, decided, on, the, london, route, but, not, to, avoid, a, battle, for, the, royalist, generals, wanted, to, fight, essex, before, he, grew, too, strong, and, the, temper, of, both, sides, made, it, impossible, to, postpone, the, decision, in, the, earl, of, clarendon, s, words, it, was, considered, more, counsellable, to, march, towards, london, it, being, morally, sure, that, the, earl, of, essex, would, put, himself, in, their, way, hence, the, army, left, shrewsbury, on, 12, october, gaining, two, days, start, on, the, enemy, and, moved, south, east, this, had, the, desired, effect, of, forcing, essex, to, move, to, intercept, them, the, first, pitched, battle, of, the, war, at, edgehill, on, 23, october, 1642, proved, inconclusive, both, royalists, and, parliamentarians, claiming, victory, the, second, field, action, the, stand, off, at, turnham, green, saw, charles, forced, to, withdraw, to, oxford, which, would, serve, as, his, base, for, the, rest, of, the, war, in, 1643, royalist, forces, won, at, adwalton, moor, gaining, control, of, most, of, yorkshire, in, the, midlands, a, parliamentary, force, under, sir, john, gell, besieged, and, captured, the, cathedral, city, of, lichfield, after, the, death, of, the, original, commander, lord, brooke, this, group, then, joined, forces, with, sir, william, brereton, at, the, inconclusive, battle, of, hopton, heath, 19, march, 1643, where, the, royalist, commander, the, earl, of, northampton, was, killed, john, hampden, died, after, being, wounded, in, the, battle, of, chalgrove, field, 18, june, 1643, subsequent, battles, in, the, west, of, england, at, lansdowne, and, roundway, down, also, went, to, the, royalists, prince, rupert, could, then, take, bristol, in, the, same, year, however, cromwell, formed, his, troop, of, ironsides, a, disciplined, unit, that, demonstrated, his, military, leadership, ability, with, their, assistance, he, won, a, victory, at, the, battle, of, gainsborough, in, july, at, this, stage, from, 7, to, 9, august, 1643, there, were, some, popular, demonstrations, in, london, both, for, and, against, war, they, were, protesting, at, westminster, a, peace, demonstration, by, london, women, which, turned, violent, was, suppressed, the, women, were, beaten, and, fired, upon, with, live, ammunition, leaving, several, dead, many, were, arrested, and, incarcerated, in, bridewell, and, other, prisons, after, these, august, events, the, venetian, ambassador, in, england, reported, to, the, doge, that, the, london, government, took, considerable, measures, to, stifle, dissent, in, general, the, early, part, of, the, war, went, well, for, the, royalists, the, turning, point, came, in, the, late, summer, and, early, autumn, of, 1643, when, the, earl, of, essex, s, army, forced, the, king, to, raise, the, siege, of, gloucester, and, then, brushed, the, royalists, aside, at, the, first, battle, of, newbury, 20, september, 1643, to, return, triumphantly, to, london, parliamentarian, forces, led, by, the, earl, of, manchester, besieged, the, port, of, king, s, lynn, norfolk, which, under, sir, hamon, l, estrange, held, out, until, september, other, forces, won, the, battle, of, winceby, giving, them, control, of, lincoln, political, manoeuvring, to, gain, an, advantage, in, numbers, led, charles, to, negotiate, a, ceasefire, in, ireland, freeing, up, english, troops, to, fight, on, the, royalist, side, in, england, while, parliament, offered, concessions, to, the, scots, in, return, for, aid, and, assistance, helped, by, the, scots, parliament, won, at, marston, moor, 2, july, 1644, gaining, york, and, the, north, of, england, cromwell, s, conduct, in, the, battle, proved, decisive, and, showed, his, potential, as, a, political, and, as, an, important, military, leader, the, defeat, at, the, battle, of, lostwithiel, in, cornwall, however, marked, a, serious, reverse, for, parliament, in, the, south, west, of, england, subsequent, fighting, around, newbury, 27, october, 1644, though, tactically, indecisive, strategically, gave, another, check, to, parliament, in, 1645, parliament, reaffirmed, its, determination, to, fight, the, war, to, a, finish, it, passed, the, self, denying, ordinance, by, which, all, members, of, either, house, of, parliament, laid, down, their, commands, and, re, organised, its, main, forces, into, the, new, model, army, under, the, command, of, sir, thomas, fairfax, with, cromwell, as, his, second, in, command, and, lieutenant, general, of, horse, in, two, decisive, engagements, the, battle, of, naseby, on, 14, june, and, the, battle, of, langport, on, 10, july, the, parliamentarians, effectively, destroyed, charles, s, armies, in, the, remains, of, his, english, realm, charles, tried, to, recover, a, stable, base, of, support, by, consolidating, the, midlands, he, began, to, form, an, axis, between, oxford, and, newark, on, trent, in, nottinghamshire, these, towns, had, become, fortresses, and, showed, more, reliable, loyalty, to, him, than, others, he, took, leicester, which, lies, between, them, but, found, his, resources, exhausted, having, little, opportunity, to, replenish, them, in, may, 1646, he, sought, shelter, with, a, presbyterian, scottish, army, at, southwell, in, nottinghamshire, charles, was, eventually, handed, over, to, the, english, parliament, by, the, scots, and, imprisoned, this, marked, the, end, of, the, first, english, civil, war, the, end, of, the, first, civil, war, in, 1646, left, a, partial, power, vacuum, in, which, any, combination, of, the, three, english, factions, royalists, independents, of, the, new, model, army, the, army, and, presbyterians, of, the, english, parliament, as, well, as, the, scottish, parliament, allied, with, the, scottish, presbyterians, the, kirk, could, prove, strong, enough, to, dominate, the, rest, armed, political, royalism, was, at, an, end, but, despite, being, a, prisoner, charles, i, was, considered, by, himself, and, his, opponents, almost, to, the, last, as, necessary, to, ensure, the, success, of, whichever, group, could, come, to, terms, with, him, thus, he, passed, successively, into, the, hands, of, the, scots, the, parliament, and, the, army, the, king, attempted, to, reverse, the, verdict, of, arms, by, coquetting, with, each, in, turn, on, 3, june, 1647, cornet, george, joyce, of, sir, thomas, fairfax, s, horse, seized, the, king, for, the, army, after, which, the, english, presbyterians, and, the, scots, began, to, prepare, for, a, fresh, civil, war, less, than, two, years, after, the, conclusion, of, the, first, this, time, against, independency, as, embodied, in, the, army, after, making, use, of, the, army, s, sword, its, opponents, attempted, to, disband, it, to, send, it, on, foreign, service, and, to, cut, off, its, arrears, of, pay, the, result, was, that, the, army, leadership, was, exasperated, beyond, control, and, remembering, not, merely, its, grievances, but, also, the, principle, for, which, the, army, had, fought, it, soon, became, the, most, powerful, political, force, in, the, realm, from, 1646, to, 1648, the, breach, between, army, and, parliament, widened, day, by, day, until, finally, the, presbyterian, party, combined, with, the, scots, and, the, remaining, royalists, felt, itself, strong, enough, to, begin, a, second, civil, war, charles, i, took, advantage, of, the, deflection, of, attention, away, from, himself, to, negotiate, on, 28, december, 1647, a, secret, treaty, with, the, scots, again, promising, church, reform, under, the, agreement, called, the, engagement, the, scots, undertook, to, invade, england, on, charles, s, behalf, and, restore, him, to, the, throne, a, series, of, royalist, uprisings, throughout, england, and, a, scottish, invasion, occurred, in, the, summer, of, 1648, forces, loyal, to, parliament, put, down, most, of, those, in, england, after, little, more, than, a, skirmish, but, uprisings, in, kent, essex, and, cumberland, the, rebellion, in, wales, and, the, scottish, invasion, involved, pitched, battles, and, prolonged, sieges, in, the, spring, of, 1649, unpaid, parliamentarian, troops, in, wales, changed, sides, colonel, thomas, horton, defeated, the, royalist, rebels, at, the, battle, of, st, fagans, 8, may, and, the, rebel, leaders, surrendered, to, cromwell, on, 11, july, after, a, protracted, two, month, siege, of, pembroke, sir, thomas, fairfax, defeated, a, royalist, uprising, in, kent, at, the, battle, of, maidstone, on, 1, june, fairfax, after, his, success, at, maidstone, and, the, pacification, of, kent, turned, north, to, reduce, essex, where, under, an, ardent, experienced, and, popular, leader, sir, charles, lucas, the, royalists, had, taken, up, arms, in, great, numbers, fairfax, soon, drove, the, enemy, into, colchester, but, his, first, attack, on, the, town, met, with, a, repulse, and, he, had, to, settle, down, to, a, long, siege, in, the, north, of, england, major, general, john, lambert, fought, a, successful, campaign, against, several, royalist, uprisings, the, largest, being, that, of, sir, marmaduke, langdale, in, cumberland, thanks, to, lambert, s, successes, the, scottish, commander, the, duke, of, hamilton, had, to, take, a, western, route, through, carlisle, in, his, pro, royalist, scottish, invasion, of, england, the, parliamentarians, under, cromwell, engaged, the, scots, at, the, battle, of, preston, 17, 19, august, the, battle, took, place, largely, at, walton, le, dale, near, preston, lancashire, and, resulted, in, a, victory, for, cromwell, s, troops, over, the, royalists, and, scots, commanded, by, hamilton, this, victory, marked, the, end, of, the, second, english, civil, war, nearly, all, the, royalists, who, had, fought, in, the, first, civil, war, had, given, their, word, not, to, bear, arms, against, parliament, and, many, like, lord, astley, were, therefore, bound, by, oath, not, to, take, any, part, in, the, second, conflict, so, the, victors, in, the, second, civil, war, showed, little, mercy, to, those, who, had, brought, war, into, the, land, again, on, the, evening, of, the, surrender, of, colchester, parliamentarians, had, sir, charles, lucas, and, sir, george, lisle, shot, parliamentary, authorities, sentenced, the, leaders, of, the, welsh, rebels, major, general, rowland, laugharne, colonel, john, poyer, and, colonel, rice, powel, to, death, but, executed, only, poyer, 25, april, 1649, having, selected, him, by, lot, of, five, prominent, royalist, peers, who, had, fallen, into, parliamentary, hands, three, the, duke, of, hamilton, the, earl, of, holland, and, lord, capel, one, of, the, colchester, prisoners, and, a, man, of, high, character, were, beheaded, at, westminster, on, 9, march, charles, s, secret, pacts, and, encouragement, of, supporters, to, break, their, parole, caused, parliament, to, debate, whether, to, return, the, king, to, power, at, all, those, who, still, supported, charles, s, place, on, the, throne, such, as, the, army, leader, and, moderate, fairfax, tried, again, to, negotiate, with, him, the, army, furious, that, parliament, continued, to, countenance, charles, as, a, ruler, then, marched, on, parliament, and, conducted, pride, s, purge, named, after, the, commanding, officer, of, the, operation, thomas, pride, in, december, 1648, troops, arrested, 45, members, and, kept, 146, out, of, the, chamber, they, allowed, only, 75, members, in, and, then, only, at, the, army, s, bidding, this, rump, parliament, received, orders, to, set, up, in, the, name, of, the, people, of, england, a, high, court, of, justice, for, the, trial, of, charles, i, for, treason, fairfax, a, constitutional, monarchist, declined, to, have, anything, to, do, with, the, trial, he, resigned, as, head, of, the, army, so, clearing, cromwell, s, road, to, power, at, the, end, of, the, trial, the, 59, commissioners, judges, found, charles, i, guilty, of, high, treason, as, a, tyrant, traitor, murderer, and, public, enemy, his, beheading, took, place, on, a, scaffold, in, front, of, the, banqueting, house, of, the, palace, of, whitehall, on, 30, january, 1649, after, the, restoration, in, 1660, nine, of, the, surviving, regicides, not, living, in, exile, were, executed, and, most, others, sentenced, to, life, imprisonment, after, the, regicide, charles, prince, of, wales, as, the, eldest, son, was, publicly, proclaimed, king, charles, ii, in, the, royal, square, of, st, helier, jersey, on, 17, february, 1649, after, a, first, such, proclamation, in, edinburgh, on, 5, february, 1649, it, took, longer, for, the, news, to, reach, the, trans, atlantic, colonies, with, the, somers, isles, also, known, as, bermuda, becoming, the, first, to, proclaim, charles, ii, king, on, 5, july, 1649, ireland, had, undergone, continual, war, since, the, rebellion, of, 1641, with, most, of, the, island, controlled, by, the, irish, confederates, increasingly, threatened, by, the, armies, of, the, english, parliament, after, charles, i, s, arrest, in, 1648, the, confederates, signed, a, treaty, of, alliance, with, the, english, royalists, the, joint, royalist, and, confederate, forces, under, the, duke, of, ormonde, tried, to, eliminate, the, parliamentary, army, holding, dublin, by, laying, siege, but, their, opponents, routed, them, at, the, battle, of,

with, an, army, to, quell, the, royalist, alliance, cromwell, s, suppression, of, the, royalists, in, ireland, in, 1649, is, still, remembered, by, many, irish, people, after, the, siege, of, drogheda, the, massacre, of, nearly, 3, 500, people, around, 2, 700, royalist, soldiers, and, 700, others, including, civilians, prisoners, and, catholic, priests, cromwell, claimed, all, had, carried, arms, became, one, of, the, historical, memories, that, has, driven, irish, english, and, catholic, protestant, strife, during, the, last, three, centuries, the, parliamentarian, conquest, of, ireland, ground, on, for, another, four, years, until, 1653, when, the, last, irish, confederate, and, royalist, troops, surrendered, in, the, wake, of, the, conquest, the, victors, confiscated, almost, all, irish, catholic, owned, land, and, distributed, it, to, parliament, s, creditors, to, parliamentary, soldiers, who, served, in, ireland, and, to, english, who, had, settled, there, before, the, war, the, execution, of, charles, i, altered, the, dynamics, of, the, civil, war, in, scotland, which, had, raged, between, royalists, and, covenanters, since, 1644, by, 1649, the, struggle, had, left, the, royalists, there, in, disarray, and, their, erstwhile, leader, the, marquess, of, montrose, had, gone, into, exile, at, first, charles, ii, encouraged, montrose, to, raise, a, highland, army, to, fight, on, the, royalist, side, when, the, scottish, covenanters, who, did, not, agree, with, the, execution, of, charles, i, and, who, feared, for, the, future, of, presbyterianism, under, the, new, commonwealth, offered, him, the, crown, of, scotland, charles, abandoned, montrose, to, his, enemies, montrose, who, had, raised, a, mercenary, force, in, norway, had, already, landed, and, could, not, abandon, the, fight, he, did, not, succeed, in, raising, many, highland, clans, and, the, covenanters, defeated, his, army, at, the, battle, of, carbisdale, in, ross, shire, on, 27, april, 1650, the, victors, captured, montrose, shortly, afterwards, and, took, him, to, edinburgh, on, 20, may, the, scottish, parliament, sentenced, him, to, death, and, had, him, hanged, the, next, day, charles, ii, landed, in, scotland, at, garmouth, in, morayshire, on, 23, june, 1650, and, signed, the, 1638, national, covenant, and, the, 1643, solemn, league, and, covenant, shortly, after, coming, ashore, with, his, original, scottish, royalist, followers, and, his, new, covenanter, allies, charles, ii, became, the, greatest, threat, facing, the, new, english, republic, in, response, to, the, threat, cromwell, left, some, of, his, lieutenants, in, ireland, to, continue, the, suppression, of, the, irish, royalists, and, returned, to, england, he, arrived, in, scotland, on, 22, july, 1650, and, proceeded, to, lay, siege, to, edinburgh, by, the, end, of, august, disease, and, a, shortage, of, supplies, had, reduced, his, army, and, he, had, to, order, a, retreat, towards, his, base, at, dunbar, a, scottish, army, under, the, command, of, david, leslie, tried, to, block, the, retreat, but, cromwell, defeated, them, at, the, battle, of, dunbar, on, 3, september, cromwell, s, army, then, took, edinburgh, and, by, the, end, of, the, year, his, army, had, occupied, much, of, southern, scotland, in, july, 1651, cromwell, s, forces, crossed, the, firth, of, forth, into, fife, and, defeated, the, scots, at, the, battle, of, inverkeithing, 20, july, 1651, the, new, model, army, advanced, towards, perth, which, allowed, charles, at, the, head, of, the, scottish, army, to, move, south, into, england, cromwell, followed, charles, into, england, leaving, george, monck, to, finish, the, campaign, in, scotland, monck, took, stirling, on, 14, august, and, dundee, on, 1, september, the, next, year, 1652, saw, a, mopping, up, of, the, remnants, of, royalist, resistance, and, under, the, terms, of, the, tender, of, union, the, scots, received, 30, seats, in, a, united, parliament, in, london, with, general, monck, as, the, military, governor, of, scotland, although, cromwell, s, new, model, army, had, defeated, a, scottish, army, at, dunbar, cromwell, could, not, prevent, charles, ii, from, marching, from, scotland, deep, into, england, at, the, head, of, another, royalist, army, they, marched, to, the, west, of, england, where, english, royalist, sympathies, were, strongest, but, although, some, english, royalists, joined, the, army, they, were, far, fewer, in, number, than, charles, and, his, scottish, supporters, had, hoped, cromwell, finally, engaged, and, defeated, the, new, scottish, king, at, worcester, on, 3, september, 1651, for, several, reasons, most, of, wales, was, not, as, engaged, in, the, english, civil, wars, to, the, same, degree, as, other, parts, of, the, british, isles, wales, was, isolated, from, england, both, physically, and, linguistically, so, the, welsh, were, not, as, much, engaged, as, england, in, the, issues, between, the, king, and, parliament, the, english, considered, wales, a, remote, land, with, welsh, not, english, as, the, primary, language, since, england, had, formally, assimilated, wales, into, the, kingdom, starting, in, 1536, formal, agreements, had, been, put, in, place, under, henry, viii, and, continued, under, charles, i, that, allowed, for, welsh, local, administrative, authority, and, economic, control, which, allowed, the, welsh, to, function, to, some, degree, independently, another, factor, was, the, puritan, religion, which, played, a, major, role, in, the, english, civil, wars, but, was, not, widely, practised, throughout, wales, welsh, puritan, religious, dominance, was, found, in, northeast, wales, near, wrexham, denbighshire, and, an, indirect, puritan, influence, found, along, the, southwestern, coast, near, haverfordwest, pembroke, and, tenby, due, to, a, combination, of, a, strong, influence, by, the, third, earl, of, essex, and, their, strong, trade, relations, with, bristol, england, a, fervent, puritan, stronghold, in, addition, wales, comparatively, more, rural, in, character, than, england, at, this, time, and, thereby, lacking, the, large, number, of, urban, settlements, home, to, mercantile, trade, and, manufacturing, interests, who, were, a, bulwark, of, support, for, both, puritanism, and, eventually, the, parliamentarian, cause, many, of, the, key, welsh, civil, wars, leaders, were, from, the, gentry, class, holding, royalist, sympathies, or, from, the, church, those, welsh, who, did, participate, in, the, civil, wars, battles, were, underequipped, underfed, and, not, properly, trained, for, warfare, the, majority, of, welsh, followed, the, protestant, faith, with, a, religious, perspective, that, differed, from, the, english, puritan, zeal, they, were, also, leery, of, the, irish, catholics, invading, wales, the, welsh, also, did, not, want, to, lose, what, they, had, for, the, gentry, were, aware, of, the, destruction, the, thirty, years, war, caused, in, europe, most, of, those, english, civil, war, battles, where, wales, was, impacted, occurred, near, the, border, with, england, and, in, south, wales, some, of, the, more, significant, engagements, were, in, addition, to, the, civil, wars, impact, on, the, monarchy, and, the, changes, in, national, leadership, unexpected, outcomes, of, the, english, civil, wars, to, wales, included, a, significant, degradation, of, the, country, s, road, system, a, deterioration, of, government, administrative, functions, to, the, general, population, destruction, of, castles, with, only, the, remnants, of, them, remaining, and, the, desecration, of, churches, after, the, royalist, defeat, at, worcester, charles, ii, escaped, to, france, via, safe, houses, and, an, oak, tree, parliament, was, left, in, de, facto, control, of, england, resistance, continued, for, a, time, in, ireland, and, scotland, but, with, the, pacification, of, england, resistance, elsewhere, did, not, threaten, the, military, supremacy, of, the, new, model, army, and, its, parliamentary, paymasters, during, the, wars, the, parliamentarians, established, a, number, of, successive, committees, to, oversee, the, war, effort, the, first, the, committee, of, safety, set, up, in, july, 1642, comprised, 15, members, of, parliament, after, the, anglo, scottish, alliance, against, the, royalists, the, committee, of, both, kingdoms, replaced, the, committee, of, safety, between, 1644, and, 1648, parliament, dissolved, the, committee, of, both, kingdoms, when, the, alliance, ended, but, its, english, members, continued, to, meet, as, the, derby, house, committee, a, second, committee, of, safety, then, replaced, it, during, the, english, civil, war, the, role, of, bishops, as, wielders, of, political, power, and, upholders, of, the, established, church, became, a, matter, of, heated, political, controversy, john, calvin, of, geneva, had, formulated, a, doctrine, of, presbyterianism, which, held, that, the, offices, of, presbyter, and, episkopos, in, the, new, testament, were, identical, he, rejected, the, doctrine, of, apostolic, succession, calvin, s, follower, john, knox, brought, presbyterianism, to, scotland, when, the, scottish, church, was, reformed, in, 1560, in, practice, presbyterianism, meant, that, committees, of, lay, elders, had, a, substantial, voice, in, church, government, as, opposed, to, merely, being, subjects, to, a, ruling, hierarchy, this, vision, of, at, least, partial, democracy, in, ecclesiology, paralleled, the, struggles, between, parliament, and, the, king, a, body, within, the, puritan, movement, in, the, church, of, england, sought, to, abolish, the, office, of, bishop, and, remake, the, church, of, england, along, presbyterian, lines, the, martin, marprelate, tracts, 1588, 1589, applying, the, pejorative, name, of, prelacy, to, the, church, hierarchy, attacked, the, office, of, bishop, with, satire, that, deeply, offended, elizabeth, i, and, her, archbishop, of, canterbury, john, whitgift, the, vestments, controversy, also, related, to, this, movement, seeking, further, reductions, in, church, ceremony, and, labelling, the, use, of, elaborate, vestments, as, unedifying, and, even, idolatrous, king, james, i, reacting, against, the, perceived, contumacy, of, his, presbyterian, scottish, subjects, adopted, no, bishop, no, king, as, a, slogan, he, tied, the, hierarchical, authority, of, the, bishop, to, the, absolute, authority, he, sought, as, king, and, viewed, attacks, on, the, authority, of, the, bishops, as, attacks, on, his, authority, matters, came, to, a, head, when, charles, i, appointed, william, laud, as, archbishop, of, canterbury, laud, aggressively, attacked, the, presbyterian, movement, and, sought, to, impose, the, full, book, of, common, prayer, the, controversy, eventually, led, to, laud, s, impeachment, for, treason, by, a, bill, of, attainder, in, 1645, and, subsequent, execution, charles, also, attempted, to, impose, episcopacy, on, scotland, the, scots, violent, rejection, of, bishops, and, liturgical, worship, sparked, the, bishops, wars, in, 1639, 1640, during, the, height, of, puritan, power, under, the, commonwealth, and, the, protectorate, episcopacy, was, formally, abolished, in, the, church, of, england, on, 9, october, 1646, the, church, of, england, remained, presbyterian, until, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, during, the, english, civil, war, the,

formidable, obstacle, for, the, parliamentary, fleet, sent, in, 1651, under, the, command, of, admiral, sir, george, ayscue, to, subdue, the, trans, atlantic, colonies, but, after, the, fall, of,

attempt, has, been, made, to, provide, rough, estimates, in, england, a, conservative, estimate, is, that, roughly, 100, 000, people, died, from, war, related, disease, during, the, three, civil, wars, historical, records, count, 84, 830, combat, dead, from, the, wars, themselves, counting, in, accidents, and, the, two, bishops, wars, an, estimate, of, 190, 000, dead, is, achieved, out, of, a, total, population, of, about, five, million, it, is, estimated, that, from, 1638, to, 1651, 15, 20, of, all, adult, males, in, england, and, wales, served, in, the, military, around, 4, of, the, total, population, died, from, war, related, causes, compared, to, 2, 23, in, the, first, world, war, as, was, typical, for, the, era, most, combat, deaths, occurred, in, minor, skirmishes, rather, than, large, pitched, battles, there, were, a, total, of, 645, engagements, throughout, the, wars, 588, of, these, involved, fewer, than, 250, casualties, in, total, with, these, 588, accounting, for, 39, 838, fatalities, average, count, of, less, than, 68, or, nearly, half, of, the, conflict, s, combat, deaths, there, were, only, 9, major, pitched, battles, at, least, 1, 000, fatalities, which, in, total, accounted, for, 15, of, casualties, an, anecdotal, example, of, how, high, casualties, in, england, may, have, been, perceived, is, to, be, found, in, the, posthumously, published, writing, generally, titled, the, history, of, myddle, by, a, shropshire, man, richard, gough, lived, 1635, 1723, of, myddle, near, shrewsbury, who, writing, in, about, 1701, commented, of, men, from, his, rural, home, parish, who, joined, the, royalist, forces, and, out, of, these, three, townes, myddle, marton, and, newton, there, went, noe, less, than, twenty, men, of, which, number, thirteen, were, kill, d, in, the, warrs, after, listing, those, he, recalled, did, not, return, home, four, of, whose, exact, fates, were, unknown, he, concluded, and, if, soe, many, dyed, out, of, these, 3, townes, wee, may, reasonably, guess, that, many, thousands, dyed, in, england, in, that, warre, figures, for, scotland, are, less, reliable, and, should, be, treated, with, caution, casualties, include, the, deaths, of, prisoners, of, war, in, conditions, that, accelerated, their, deaths, with, estimates, of, 10, 000, prisoners, not, surviving, or, not, returning, home, 8, 000, captured, during, and, immediately, after, the, battle, of, worcester, were, deported, to, new, england, bermuda, and, the, west, indies, to, work, for, landowners, as, indentured, labourers, there, are, no, figures, to, calculate, how, many, died, from, war, related, diseases, but, if, the, same, ratio, of, disease, to, battle, deaths, from, english, figures, is, applied, to, the, scottish, figures, a, not, unreasonable, estimate, of, 60, 000, people, is, achieved, from, a, population, of, about, one, million, figures, for, ireland, are, described, as, miracles, of, conjecture, certainly, the, devastation, inflicted, on, ireland, was, massive, with, the, best, estimate, provided, by, sir, william, petty, the, father, of, english, demography, petty, estimated, that, 112, 000, protestants, and, 504, 000, catholics, were, killed, through, plague, war, and, famine, giving, an, estimated, total, of, 616, 000, dead, out, of, a, pre, war, population, of, about, one, and, a, half, million, although, petty, s, figures, are, the, best, available, they, are, still, acknowledged, as, tentative, they, do, not, include, an, estimated, 40, 000, driven, into, exile, some, of, whom, served, as, soldiers, in, european, continental, armies, while, others, were, sold, as, indentured, servants, to, new, england, and, the, west, indies, many, of, those, sold, to, landowners, in, new, england, eventually, prospered, but, many, sold, to, landowners, in, the, west, indies, were, worked, to, death, these, estimates, indicate, that, england, suffered, a, 4, per, cent, loss, of, population, scotland, a, loss, of, 6, per, cent, while, ireland, suffered, a, loss, of, 41, per, cent, of, its, population, putting, these, numbers, into, the, context, of, other, catastrophes, helps, to, understand, the, devastation, of, ireland, in, particular, the, great, famine, of, 1845, 1852, resulted, in, a, loss, of, 16, per, cent, of, the, population, while, during, the, soviet, famine, and, holodomor, of, 1932, 33, the, population, of, the, soviet, ukraine, fell, by, 14, per, cent, ordinary, people, took, advantage, of, the, dislocation, of, civil, society, in, the, 1640s, to, gain, personal, advantages, the, contemporary, guild, democracy, movement, won, its, greatest, successes, among, london, s, transport, workers, rural, communities, seized, timber, and, other, resources, on, the, sequestrated, estates, of, royalists, and, catholics, and, on, the, estates, of, the, royal, family, and, church, hierarchy, some, communities, improved, their, conditions, of, tenure, on, such, estates, the, old, status, quo, began, a, retrenchment, after, the, end, of, the, first, civil, war, in, 1646, and, more, especially, after, the, restoration, in, 1660, but, some, gains, were, long, term, the, democratic, element, introduced, into, the, watermen, s, company, in, 1642, for, example, survived, with, vicissitudes, until, 1827, the, wars, left, england, scotland, and, ireland, among, the, few, countries, in, europe, without, a, monarch, in, the, wake, of, victory, many, of, the, ideals, and, many, idealists, became, sidelined, the, republican, government, of, the, commonwealth, of, england, ruled, england, and, later, all, of, scotland, and, ireland, from, 1649, to, 1653, and, from, 1659, to, 1660, between, the, two, periods, and, due, to, in, fighting, among, various, factions, in, parliament, oliver, cromwell, ruled, over, the, protectorate, as, lord, protector, effectively, a, military, dictator, until, his, death, in, 1658, on, oliver, cromwell, s, death, his, son, richard, became, lord, protector, but, the, army, had, little, confidence, in, him, after, seven, months, the, army, removed, richard, in, may, 1659, it, re, installed, the, rump, military, force, shortly, afterward, dissolved, this, as, well, after, the, second, dissolution, of, the, rump, in, october, 1659, the, prospect, of, a, total, descent, into, anarchy, loomed, as, the, army, s, pretense, of, unity, dissolved, into, factions, into, this, atmosphere, general, george, monck, governor, of, scotland, under, the, cromwells, marched, south, with, his, army, from, scotland, on, 4, april, 1660, in, the, declaration, of, breda, charles, ii, made, known, the, conditions, of, his, acceptance, of, the, crown, of, england, monck, organised, the, convention, parliament, which, met, for, the, first, time, on, 25, april, 1660, on, 8, may, 1660, it, declared, that, charles, ii, had, reigned, as, the, lawful, monarch, since, the, execution, of, charles, i, in, january, 1649, charles, returned, from, exile, on, 23, may, 1660, on, 29, may, 1660, the, populace, in, london, acclaimed, him, as, king, his, coronation, took, place, at, westminster, abbey, on, 23, april, 1661, these, events, became, known, as, the, restoration, although, the, monarchy, was, restored, it, was, still, with, the, consent, of, parliament, so, the, civil, wars, effectively, set, england, and, scotland, on, course, towards, a, parliamentary, monarchy, form, of, government, the, outcome, of, this, system, was, that, the, future, kingdom, of, great, britain, formed, in, 1707, under, the, acts, of, union, managed, to, forestall, the, kind, of, revolution, typical, of, european, republican, movements, which, generally, resulted, in, total, abolition, of, their, monarchies, thus, the, united, kingdom, was, spared, the, wave, of, revolutions, that, occurred, in, europe, in, the, 1840s, specifically, future, monarchs, became, wary, of, pushing, parliament, too, hard, and, parliament, effectively, chose, the, line, of, royal, succession, in, 1688, with, the, glorious, revolution, thomas, hobbes, gave, an, early, historical, account, of, the, english, civil, war, in, his, behemoth, written, in, 1668, and, published, in, 1681, he, assessed, the, causes, of, the, war, to, be, the, conflicting, political, doctrines, of, the, time, behemoth, offered, a, uniquely, historical, and, philosophical, approach, to, naming, the, catalysts, for, the, war, it, also, attempted, to, explain, why, charles, i, could, not, hold, his, throne, and, maintain, peace, in, his, kingdom, hobbes, analysed, the, following, aspects, of, english, thought, during, the, war, the, opinions, of, divinity, and, politics, that, spurred, rebellion, rhetoric, and, doctrine, used, by, the, rebels, against, the, king, and, how, opinions, about, taxation, the, conscription, of, soldiers, and, military, strategy, affected, the, outcomes, of, battles, and, shifts, of, sovereignty, hobbes, attributed, the, war, to, the, novel, theories, of, intellectuals, and, divines, spread, for, their, own, pride, of, reputation, he, held, that, clerical, pretensions, had, contributed, significantly, to, the, troubles, whether, those, of, puritan, fundamentalists, papal, supremacists, or, divine, right, episcopalians, hobbes, wanted, to, abolish, the, independence, of, the, clergy, and, bring, it, under, the, control, of, the, civil, state, some, scholars, suggest, that, hobbes, s, behemoth, has, not, received, its, due, as, an, academic, work, being, comparatively, overlooked, and, under, rated, in, the, shadow, of, the, same, author, s, leviathan, its, scholarly, reputation, may, have, suffered, because, it, takes, the, form, of, a, dialogue, which, while, common, in, philosophy, is, rarely, adopted, by, historians, other, factors, that, hindered, its, success, include, charles, ii, s, refusing, its, publication, and, hobbes, lack, of, empathy, with, views, different, from, his, own, in, the, early, decades, of, the, 20th, century, the, whig, school, was, the, dominant, theoretical, view, it, explained, the, civil, war, as, resulting, from, centuries, of, struggle, between, parliament, notably, the, house, of, commons, and, the, monarchy, with, parliament, defending, the, traditional, rights, of, englishmen, while, the, stuart, monarchy, continually, attempted, to, expand, its, right, to, dictate, law, arbitrarily, the, major, whig, historian, s, r, gardiner, popularised, the, idea, that, the, english, civil, war, was, a, puritan, revolution, that, challenged, the, repressive, stuart, church, and, prepared, the, way, for, religious, toleration, thus, puritanism, was, seen, as, the, natural, ally, of, a, people, preserving, their, traditional, rights, against, arbitrary, monarchical, power, the, whig, view, was, challenged, and, largely, superseded, by, the, marxist, school, which, became, popular, in, the, 1940s, and, saw, the, english, civil, war, as, a, bourgeois, revolution, according, to, marxist, historian, christopher, hill, the, civil, war, was, a, class, war, in, which, the, despotism, of, charles, i, was, defended, by, the, reactionary, forces, of, the, established, church, and, conservative, landlords, parliament, beat, the, king, because, it, could, appeal, to, the, enthusiastic, support, of, the, trading, and, industrial, classes, in, town, and, countryside, to, the, yeomen, and, progressive, gentry, and, to, wider, masses, of, the, population, whenever, they, were, able, by, free, discussion, to, understand, what, the, struggle, was, really, about, in, the, 1970s, revisionist, historians, challenged, both, the, whig, and, the, marxist, theories, notably, in, the, 1973, anthology, the, origins, of, the, english, civil, war, conrad, russell, ed, these, historians, focused, on, the, minutiae, of, the, years, immediately, before, the, civil, war, returning, to, the, contingency, based, historiography, of, clarendon, s, history, of, the, rebellion, and, civil, wars, in, england, this, it, was, claimed, demonstrated, that, patterns, of, war, allegiance, did, not, fit, either, whig, or, marxist, theories, parliament, was, not, inherently, progressive, nor, the, events, of, 1640, a, precursor, for, the, glorious, revolution, many, members, of, the, bourgeoisie, fought, for, the, king, while, many, landed, aristocrats, supported, parliament, from, the, 1990s, a, number, of, historians, replaced, the, historical, title, english, civil, war, with, wars, of, the, three, kingdoms, and, british, civil, wars, positing, that, the, civil, war, in, england, cannot, be, understood, apart, from, events, in, other, parts, of, britain, and, ireland, king, charles, i, remains, crucial, not, just, as, king, of, england, but, through, his, relationship, with, the, peoples, of, his, other, realms, for, example, the, wars, began, when, charles, forced, an, anglican, prayer, book, upon, scotland, and, when, this, was, met, with, resistance, from, the, covenanters, he, needed, an, army, to, impose, his, will, however, this, need, of, military, funds, forced, charles, i, to, call, an, english, parliament, which, was, not, willing, to, grant, the, needed, revenue, unless, he, addressed, their, grievances, by, the, early, 1640s, charles, was, left, in, a, state, of, near, permanent, crisis, management, confounded, by, the, demands, of, the, various, factions, for, example, charles, finally, made, terms, with, the, covenanters, in, august, 1641, but, although, this, might, have, weakened, the, position, of, the, english, parliament, the, irish, rebellion, of, 1641, broke, out, in, october, 1641, largely, negating, the, political, advantage, he, had, obtained, by, relieving, himself, of, the, cost, of, the, scottish, invasion, a, number, of, revisionist, historians, such, as, william, m, lamont, regarded, the, conflict, as, a, religious, war, with, john, morrill, 1993, stating, the, english, civil, war, was, not, the, first, european, revolution, it, was, the, last, of, the, wars, of, religion, this, view, has, been, criticised, by, various, pre, post, and, anti, revisionist, historians, glen, burgess, 1998, examined, political, propaganda, written, by, the, parliamentarian, politicians, and, clerics, at, the, time, noting, that, many, were, or, may, have, been, motivated, by, their, puritan, religious, beliefs, to, support, the, war, against, the, catholic, king, charles, i, but, tried, to, express, and, legitimise, their, opposition, and, rebellion, in, terms, of, a, legal, revolt, against, a, monarch, who, had, violated, crucial, constitutional, principles, and, thus, had, to, be, overthrown, they, even, warned, their, parliamentarian, allies, to, not, make, overt, use, of, religious, arguments, in, making, their, case, for, war, against, the, king, however, in, some, cases, it, may, be, argued, that, they, hid, their, pro, anglican, and, anti, catholic, motives, behind, legal, parliance, for, example, by, emphasising, that, the, church, of, england, was, the, legally, established, religion, seen, in, this, light, the, defences, of,
