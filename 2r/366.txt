state, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, inca, empire, also, known, as, the, conquest, of, peru, was, one, of, the, most, important, campaigns, in, the, spanish, colonization, of, the, americas, after, years, of, preliminary, exploration, and, military, skirmishes, 168, spanish, soldiers, under, conquistador, francisco, pizarro, along, with, his, brothers, in, arms, and, their, indigenous, allies, captured, the, sapa, inca, atahualpa, in, the, 1532, battle, of, cajamarca, it, was, the, first, step, in, a, long, campaign, that, took, decades, of, fighting, but, ended, in, spanish, victory, in, 1572, and, colonization, of, the, region, as, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, the, conquest, of, the, inca, empire, called, tahuantinsuyu, or, tawantinsuyu, in, quechua, meaning, realm, of, the, four, parts, led, to, spin, off, campaigns, into, present, day, chile, and, colombia, as, well, as, expeditions, to, the, amazon, basin, and, surrounding, rainforest, when, the, spanish, arrived, at, the, borders, of, the, inca, empire, in, 1528, it, spanned, a, considerable, area, and, was, by, far, the, largest, of, the, four, grand, pre, columbian, civilizations, extending, southward, from, the, ancomayo, which, is, now, known, as, the, pat, a, river, in, southern, present, day, colombia, to, the, maule, river, in, what, would, later, be, known, as, chile, and, eastward, from, the, pacific, ocean, to, the, edge, of, the, amazonian, jungles, it, covered, some, of, the, most, mountainous, terrains, on, earth, in, less, than, a, century, the, inca, had, expanded, their, empire, from, about, 400, 000, km, 2, 150, 000, sq, mi, in, 1448, to, 1, 800, 000, km, 2, 690, 000, sq, mi, in, 1528, just, before, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, this, vast, area, of, land, varied, greatly, in, culture, and, climate, because, of, the, diverse, cultures, and, geography, the, inca, allowed, many, areas, of, the, empire, to, be, governed, under, the, control, of, local, leaders, who, were, watched, and, monitored, by, inca, officials, under, the, administrative, mechanisms, established, by, the, inca, all, parts, of, the, empire, answered, to, and, were, ultimately, under, the, direct, control, of, the, inca, emperor, scholars, estimate, that, the, population, of, the, inca, empire, was, more, than, 16, 000, 000, some, scholars, such, as, jared, diamond, believe, that, while, the, spanish, conquest, was, undoubtedly, the, proximate, cause, of, the, collapse, of, the, inca, empire, it, may, very, well, have, been, past, its, peak, and, already, in, the, process, of, decline, in, 1528, emperor, huayna, capac, ruled, the, inca, empire, he, could, trace, his, lineage, back, to, a, stranger, king, named, manco, c, pac, the, mythical, founder, of, the, inca, clan, 144, who, according, to, tradition, emerged, from, a, cave, in, a, region, called, paqariq, tampu, huayna, capac, was, the, son, of, the, previous, ruler, t, pac, inca, and, the, grandson, of, pachacuti, the, emperor, who, by, conquest, had, commenced, the, dramatic, expansion, of, the, inca, empire, from, its, cultural, and, traditional, base, in, the, area, around, cusco, on, his, accession, to, the, throne, huayna, capac, had, continued, the, policy, of, expansion, by, conquest, taking, inca, armies, north, into, what, is, today, ecuador, 98, while, he, had, to, put, down, a, number, of, rebellions, during, his, reign, by, the, time, of, his, death, his, legitimacy, was, as, unquestioned, as, was, the, primacy, of, inca, power, expansion, had, caused, its, own, set, of, problems, many, parts, of, the, empire, retained, distinct, cultures, which, were, at, best, reluctant, to, become, part, of, the, greater, imperial, project, due, to, its, size, and, the, fact, that, all, communication, and, travel, had, to, take, place, by, foot, or, by, boat, the, inca, empire, proved, increasingly, difficult, to, administer, and, govern, with, the, inca, emperor, having, increasingly, less, influence, over, local, areas, huayna, capac, relied, on, his, sons, to, support, his, reign, while, he, had, many, legitimate, born, of, his, sister, wife, under, the, inca, system, and, illegitimate, children, two, sons, are, historically, important, prince, t, pac, cusi, hualpa, also, known, as, hu, scar, was, the, son, of, coya, mama, rahua, occllo, of, the, royal, line, the, second, was, atahualpa, an, illegitimate, son, who, was, likely, born, of, a, daughter, of, the, last, independent, king, of, quitu, one, of, the, states, conquered, by, huayna, capac, during, the, expansion, of, the, inca, empire, these, two, sons, would, play, pivotal, roles, in, the, final, years, of, the, inca, empire, the, spanish, conquistador, pizarro, and, his, men, were, greatly, aided, in, their, enterprise, by, invading, when, the, inca, empire, was, in, the, midst, of, a, war, of, succession, between, the, princes, hu, scar, and, atahualpa, 143, atahualpa, seems, to, have, spent, more, time, with, huayna, capac, during, the, years, when, he, was, in, the, north, with, the, army, conquering, ecuador, atahualpa, was, thus, closer, to, and, had, better, relations, with, the, army, and, its, leading, generals, when, both, huayna, capac, and, his, eldest, son, and, designated, heir, ninan, cuyochic, died, suddenly, in, 1528, from, what, was, probably, smallpox, a, disease, introduced, by, the, spanish, into, the, americas, the, question, of, who, would, succeed, as, emperor, was, thrown, open, huayna, had, died, before, he, could, nominate, the, new, heir, at, the, time, of, huayna, capac, s, death, hu, scar, was, in, the, capital, cuzco, while, atahualpa, was, in, quito, with, the, main, body, of, the, inca, army, hu, scar, had, himself, proclaimed, sapa, inca, i, e, only, emperor, in, cuzco, but, the, army, declared, loyalty, to, atahualpa, the, resulting, dispute, led, to, the, inca, civil, war, 146, 149, the, civil, war, between, atahualpa, and, huascar, weakened, the, empire, immediately, prior, to, its, struggle, with, the, spanish, historians, are, unsure, if, a, united, inca, empire, would, have, defeated, the, spanish, in, the, long, term, due, to, factors, such, as, the, high, mortality, from, disease, and, the, resulting, social, disruption, and, the, superior, military, technology, of, the, conquistadors, who, possessed, horses, dogs, metal, armor, swords, cannons, and, primitive, but, effective, firearms, atahualpa, appeared, to, be, more, popular, with, the, people, than, his, brother, and, he, was, certainly, more, valued, by, the, army, the, core, of, which, was, based, in, the, recently, conquered, northern, province, of, quito, at, the, outset, of, the, conflict, each, brother, controlled, his, respective, domains, with, atahualpa, secure, in, the, north, and, hu, scar, controlling, the, capital, of, cuzco, and, the, large, territory, to, the, south, including, the, area, around, lake, titicaca, this, region, had, supplied, large, numbers, of, soldiers, for, hu, scar, s, forces, after, a, period, of, diplomatic, posturing, and, jockeying, for, position, open, warfare, broke, out, hu, scar, seemed, poised, to, bring, the, war, to, a, rapid, and, decisive, conclusion, as, troops, loyal, to, him, took, atahualpa, prisoner, while, he, was, attending, a, festival, in, the, city, of, tumebamba, however, atahualpa, quickly, escaped, and, returned, to, quito, there, he, was, able, to, amass, what, is, estimated, to, be, at, least, 30, 000, well, trained, soldiers, while, hu, scar, managed, to, muster, about, the, same, number, of, soldiers, they, were, much, less, experienced, atahualpa, sent, his, forces, south, under, the, command, of, two, of, his, leading, generals, challcuchima, and, quisquis, who, won, an, uninterrupted, series, of, victories, against, hu, scar, that, soon, brought, them, to, the, very, gates, of, cuzco, on, the, first, day, of, the, battle, for, cuzco, the, forces, loyal, to, hu, scar, gained, an, early, advantage, however, on, the, second, day, hu, scar, personally, led, an, ill, advised, surprise, attack, of, which, the, generals, challcuchima, and, quisquis, had, advanced, knowledge, in, the, ensuing, battle, hu, scar, was, captured, and, resistance, completely, collapsed, the, victorious, generals, sent, word, north, by, chasqui, messenger, to, atahualpa, who, had, moved, south, from, quito, to, the, royal, resort, springs, outside, cajamarca, the, messenger, arrived, with, news, of, the, final, victory, on, the, same, day, that, pizarro, and, his, small, band, of, adventurers, together, with, some, indigenous, allies, descended, from, the, andes, into, the, town, of, cajamarca, francisco, pizarro, and, his, brothers, gonzalo, juan, and, hernando, were, attracted, by, the, rumors, of, a, rich, and, fabulous, kingdom, they, had, left, the, then, impoverished, extremadura, like, many, migrants, after, them, 136, there, lies, peru, with, its, riches, here, panama, and, its, poverty, choose, each, man, what, best, becomes, a, brave, castilian, in, 1529, francisco, pizarro, obtained, permission, from, the, spanish, monarchy, to, conquer, the, land, they, called, peru, 133, according, to, historian, ra, l, porras, barrenechea, peru, is, not, a, quechuan, nor, caribbean, word, but, indo, european, or, hybrid, unknown, to, pizarro, as, he, was, lobbying, for, permission, to, mount, an, expedition, his, proposed, enemy, was, being, devastated, by, the, diseases, brought, to, the, american, continents, during, earlier, spanish, contacts, when, pizarro, arrived, in, peru, in, 1532, he, found, it, vastly, different, from, when, he, had, been, there, just, five, years, before, amid, the, ruins, of, the, city, of, tumbes, he, tried, to, piece, together, the, situation, before, him, from, two, local, boys, whom, pizarro, had, taught, how, to, speak, spanish, in, order, to, translate, for, him, pizarro, learned, of, the, civil, war, and, of, the, disease, that, was, destroying, the, inca, empire, after, four, long, expeditions, pizarro, established, the, first, spanish, settlement, in, northern, peru, calling, it, san, miguel, de, piura, 153, 154, when, first, spotted, by, the, natives, pizarro, and, his, men, were, thought, to, be, viracocha, cuna, or, gods, the, natives, described, pizarro, s, men, to, the, inca, they, said, that, capito, was, tall, with, a, full, beard, and, was, completely, wrapped, in, clothing, the, natives, described, the, men, s, swords, and, how, they, killed, sheep, with, them, the, men, did, not, eat, human, flesh, but, rather, sheep, lamb, duck, pigeons, and, deer, and, cooked, the, meat, atahualpa, was, fearful, of, what, the, newly, arrived, white, men, were, capable, of, if, they, were, runa, quicachac, or, destroyers, of, peoples, then, he, should, flee, if, they, were, viracocha, cuna, runa, allichac, or, gods, who, are, benefactors, of, the, people, then, he, should, not, flee, but, welcome, them, the, messengers, went, back, to, tangarala, and, atahualpa, sent, cinquinchara, an, orejon, warrior, to, the, spanish, to, serve, as, an, interpreter, after, traveling, with, the, spanish, cinquinchara, returned, to, atahualpa, they, discussed, whether, or, not, the, spanish, men, were, gods, cinquinchara, decided, they, were, men, because, he, saw, them, eat, drink, dress, and, have, relations, with, women, he, saw, them, produce, no, miracles, cinquinchara, informed, atahualpa, that, they, were, small, in, number, about, 170, 180, men, and, had, bound, the, native, captives, with, iron, ropes, when, atahualpa, asked, what, to, do, about, the, strangers, cinquinchara, advised, that, they, be, killed, because, they, were, evil, thieves, who, would, take, whatever, they, wanted, and, were, supai, cuna, or, devils, he, recommended, trapping, the, men, inside, of, their, sleeping, quarters, and, burning, them, to, death, after, his, victory, and, the, capture, of, his, brother, hu, scar, atahualpa, was, fasting, in, the, inca, baths, outside, cajamarca, pizarro, and, his, men, reached, the, city, on, 15, november, 1532, pizarro, sent, hernando, de, soto, to, the, atahualpa, s, camp, de, soto, rode, to, meet, atahualpa, on, his, horse, an, animal, that, atahualpa, had, never, seen, before, with, one, of, his, young, interpreters, soto, read, a, prepared, speech, to, atahualpa, telling, him, that, they, had, come, as, servants, of, god, to, teach, them, the, truth, about, god, s, word, he, said, he, was, speaking, to, them, so, that, they, might, lay, the, foundation, of, concord, brotherhood, and, perpetual, peace, that, should, exist, between, us, so, that, you, may, receive, us, under, your, protection, and, hear, the, divine, law, from, us, and, all, your, people, may, learn, and, receive, it, for, it, will, be, the, greatest, honor, advantage, and, salvation, to, them, all, additionally, they, invited, the, inca, leader, to, visit, pizarro, at, his, quarters, along, the, cajamarca, plaza, when, de, soto, noticed, atahualpa, s, interest, in, his, horse, he, put, on, a, display, of, excellent, horsemanship, in, close, proximity, atahualpa, displayed, hospitality, by, serving, refreshments, 166, 170, atahualpa, responded, only, after, francisco, pizarro, s, brother, hernando, pizarro, arrived, he, replied, with, what, he, had, heard, from, his, scouts, that, that, the, spanish, had, been, killing, and, enslaving, countless, numbers, of, people, and, civilians, on, the, coast, pizarro, denied, the, report, and, atahualpa, with, limited, information, reluctantly, let, the, matter, go, at, the, end, of, their, meeting, the, men, agreed, to, meet, the, next, day, at, cajamarca, the, next, morning, on, 16, november, 1532, pizarro, had, arranged, an, ambuscade, around, the, cajamarca, plaza, where, they, were, to, meet, at, this, point, pizarro, had, in, total, 168, men, under, his, command, 106, on, foot, and, 62, on, horseback, when, atahualpa, arrived, with, about, 6, 000, unarmed, followers, friar, vincente, de, valverde, and, the, interpreter, felipillo, met, them, and, proceeded, to, expound, the, doctrines, of, the, true, faith, requerimiento, and, seek, his, tribute, as, a, vassal, of, king, charles, the, unskilled, translator, likely, contributed, to, problems, in, communication, the, friar, offered, atahualpa, the, bible, as, the, authority, of, what, he, had, just, stated, atahualpa, stated, i, will, be, no, man, s, tributary, 173, 177, pizarro, urged, attack, starting, the, battle, of, cajamarca, the, battle, began, with, a, shot, from, a, cannon, and, the, battle, cry, santiago, the, spaniards, unleashed, volleys, of, gunfire, at, the, vulnerable, mass, of, incas, and, surged, forward, in, a, concerted, action, pizarro, also, used, devastating, cavalry, charges, against, the, inca, forces, which, stunned, them, in, combination, with, the, supporting, gunfire, 177, 179, however, many, of, the, guns, used, by, the, spaniards, were, hard, to, use, in, close, quarters, combat, the, effect, was, devastating, and, the, shocked, incas, offered, such, feeble, resistance, that, the, battle, has, often, been, labeled, a, massacre, with, the, 2, 000, incas, slain, and, the, spanish, with, only, one, soldier, wounded, though, the, historical, accounts, relating, to, the, circumstances, vary, the, true, spanish, motives, for, the, attack, seemed, to, be, a, desire, for, loot, and, flat, out, impatience, the, inca, likely, did, not, adequately, understand, the, conquistadors, demands, pizarro, knew, that, his, forces, were, badly, outnumbered, but, that, capturing, the, emperor, and, holding, him, hostage, would, give, him, a, key, edge, the, majority, of, atahualpa, s, troops, were, in, the, cuzco, region, along, with, quisquis, and, challcuchima, the, two, generals, he, trusted, the, most, this, was, a, major, disadvantage, for, the, inca, their, undoing, also, resulted, from, a, lack, of, self, confidence, and, a, desire, to, make, public, demonstration, of, fearlessness, and, godlike, command, of, situation, the, main, view, is, that, the, inca, were, eventually, defeated, due, to, inferior, weapons, open, battle, tactics, disease, internal, unrest, the, bold, tactics, of, the, spanish, and, the, capture, of, the, inca, s, emperor, spanish, armor, was, very, effective, against, most, of, the, andean, weapons, though, it, was, not, entirely, impenetrable, to, maces, clubs, or, slings, later, most, natives, adapted, in, guerrilla, fashion, by, only, shooting, at, the, legs, of, the, conquistadors, if, they, happened, to, be, unarmored, however, ensuing, hostilities, such, as, the, mixt, n, rebellion, chichimeca, war, and, arauco, war, would, require, that, the, conquistadors, ally, with, friendly, tribes, in, these, later, expeditions, by, february, 1533, almagro, had, joined, pizarro, in, cajamarca, with, an, additional, 150, men, with, 50, horses, 186, 194, after, the, spanish, captured, atahualpa, at, the, massacre, at, cajamarca, they, allowed, his, wives, to, join, him, and, the, spanish, soldiers, taught, him, the, game, of, chess, 215, 234, during, atahualpa, s, captivity, the, spanish, although, greatly, outnumbered, forced, him, to, order, his, generals, to, back, down, by, threatening, to, kill, him, if, he, did, not, according, to, the, spanish, envoy, s, demands, atahualpa, offered, to, fill, a, large, room, with, gold, and, promised, twice, that, amount, in, silver, while, pizarro, ostensibly, accepted, this, offer, and, allowed, the, gold, to, pile, up, he, had, no, intention, of, releasing, the, inca, he, needed, atahualpa, s, influence, over, his, generals, and, the, people, in, order, to, maintain, the, peace, the, treasure, began, to, be, delivered, from, cuzco, on, 20, december, 1532, and, flowed, steadily, from, then, on, by, 3, may, 1533, pizarro, received, all, the, treasure, he, had, requested, it, was, melted, refined, and, made, into, bars, hernando, pizarro, went, to, gather, gold, and, silver, from, the, temples, in, pachacamac, in, january, 1533, and, on, his, return, in, march, 237, captured, chalcuchimac, in, the, jauja, valley, francisco, pizzaro, sent, a, similar, expedition, to, cuzco, bringing, back, many, gold, plates, from, the, temple, of, the, sun, the, question, eventually, came, up, of, what, to, do, with, atahualpa, both, pizarro, and, soto, reportedly, spoke, against, killing, him, but, the, other, spaniards, were, loud, in, their, demands, for, death, false, interpretations, from, the, interpreter, felipillo, made, the, spaniards, paranoid, they, were, told, that, atahualpa, had, ordered, secret, attacks, and, his, warriors, were, hidden, in, the, surrounding, area, soto, went, with, a, small, force, to, scout, for, the, hidden, army, and, the, show, trial, of, atahualpa, was, held, in, his, absence, among, the, charges, were, polygamy, incestuous, marriage, and, idolatry, all, frowned, upon, in, catholicism, but, common, in, inca, culture, and, religion, the, men, who, were, against, atahualpa, s, conviction, and, murder, argued, that, he, should, be, judged, by, king, charles, since, he, was, the, sovereign, prince, atahualpa, was, forced, to, submit, to, baptism, to, avoid, being, burned, at, the, stake, and, in, the, hopes, of, one, day, rejoining, his, army, and, killing, the, spanish, they, referred, to, him, as, francisco, for, the, purposes, of, the, ritual, on, 29, august, 1533, the, spanish, captors, murdered, atahualpa, by, garrotting, he, was, buried, with, christian, rites, in, the, church, of, san, francisco, at, cajamarca, but, was, soon, disinterred, his, body, was, recovered, probably, at, his, prior, request, and, borne, to, its, final, resting, place, in, quito, upon, de, soto, s, return, he, was, furious, he, had, found, no, evidence, of, any, secret, gathering, of, atahualpa, s, warriors, pizarro, advanced, with, his, army, of, 500, spaniards, toward, cuzco, accompanied, by, chalcuchimac, the, latter, was, burned, alive, in, the, jauja, valley, accused, of, secret, communication, with, quizquiz, and, organizing, resistance, manco, inca, yupanqui, joined, pizarro, after, the, death, of, t, pac, huallpa, pizarro, s, force, entered, the, heart, of, the, tawantinsuyu, on, 15, november, 1533, 191, 210, 216, benalc, zar, pizarro, s, lieutenant, and, fellow, extremaduran, had, already, departed, from, san, miguel, with, 140, foot, soldiers, and, a, few, horses, on, his, conquering, mission, to, ecuador, at, the, foot, of, mount, chimborazo, near, the, modern, city, of, riobamba, ecuador, he, met, and, defeated, the, forces, of, the, great, inca, warrior, rumi, awi, with, the, aid, of, ca, ari, tribesmen, who, served, as, guides, and, allies, to, the, conquering, spaniards, rumi, ahui, fell, back, to, quito, and, while, in, pursuit, of, the, inca, army, benalc, zar, was, joined, by, five, hundred, men, led, by, guatemalan, governor, pedro, de, alvarado, greedy, for, gold, alvarado, had, set, sail, for, the, south, without, the, crown, s, authorization, landed, on, the, ecuadorian, coast, and, marched, inland, to, the, sierra, finding, quito, empty, of, its, people, s, treasure, alvarado, soon, joined, the, combined, spanish, force, alvarado, agreed, to, sell, his, fleet, of, twelve, ships, his, forces, plus, arms, and, ammunition, and, returned, to, guatemala, 224, 227, 268, 284, after, atahualpa, s, murder, pizarro, installed, atahualpa, s, brother, t, pac, huallpa, as, a, puppet, inca, ruler, but, he, soon, died, unexpectedly, leaving, manco, inca, yupanqui, in, power, he, began, his, rule, as, an, ally, of, the, spanish, and, was, respected, in, the, southern, regions, of, the, empire, but, there, was, still, much, unrest, in, the, north, near, quito, where, atahualpa, s, generals, were, amassing, troops, atahualpa, s, murder, meant, that, there, was, no, hostage, left, to, deter, these, northern, armies, from, attacking, the, invaders, led, by, atahualpa, s, generals, rumi, ahui, zope, zupahua, and, quisquis, the, native, armies, were, finally, defeated, effectively, ending, any, organized, rebellion, in, the, north, of, the, empire, 221, 223, 226, manco, inca, initially, had, good, relations, with, francisco, pizarro, and, several, other, spanish, conquistadors, however, in, 1535, he, was, left, in, cuzco, under, the, control, of, pizarro, s, brothers, juan, and, gonzalo, who, so, mistreated, manco, inca, that, he, ultimately, rebelled, under, the, pretense, of, recovering, a, statue, of, pure, gold, in, the, nearby, yucay, valley, manco, was, able, to, escape, cuzco, 235, 237, manco, inca, hoped, to, use, the, disagreement, between, almagro, and, pizarro, to, his, advantage, and, attempted, the, recapture, of, cuzco, starting, in, april, 1536, the, siege, of, cuzco, was, waged, until, the, following, spring, and, during, that, time, manco, s, armies, managed, to, wipe, out, four, relief, columns, sent, from, lima, but, was, ultimately, unsuccessful, in, its, goal, of, routing, the, spaniards, from, the, city, the, inca, leadership, did, not, have, the, full, support, of, all, its, subject, peoples, and, furthermore, the, degrading, state, of, inca, morale, coupled, with, the, superior, spanish, siege, weapons, soon, made, manco, inca, realize, his, hope, of, recapturing, cuzco, was, failing, manco, inca, eventually, withdrew, to, tambo, 239, 247, archaeological, evidence, of, the, rebellion, incident, exists, showing, that, the, spanish, conquistadors, were, aided, by, native, indian, allies, the, remains, of, about, 70, men, women, and, adolescents, were, found, in, the, path, of, a, planned, expressway, near, lima, in, 2007, forensic, evidence, suggests, that, european, weapons, killed, some, of, the, natives, probably, during, the, uprising, in, 1536, but, that, the, vast, majority, had, been, killed, by, local, indigenous, weapons, after, the, spanish, re, occupied, cuzco, manco, inca, and, his, armies, retreated, to, the, fortress, at, ollantaytambo, where, he, for, a, time, successfully, launched, attacks, against, pizarro, based, at, cuzco, and, even, managed, to, defeat, the, spanish, occupiers, in, an, open, battle, 247, 249, when, it, became, clear, that, defeat, was, imminent, manco, inca, retreated, further, to, the, mountainous, region, 259, of, vilcabamba, and, established, the, small, neo, inca, state, where, manco, inca, and, his, successors, continued, to, hold, some, power, for, several, more, decades, his, son, t, pac, amaru, was, the, last, inca, being, killed, by, the, spanish, in, 1572, in, total, the, conquest, took, about, forty, years, to, complete, many, inca, attempts, to, regain, their, empire, had, occurred, but, none, had, been, successful, thus, the, spanish, conquest, was, achieved, aided, by, factors, like, smallpox, and, a, great, communication, and, cultural, divide, the, spaniards, destroyed, much, of, the, inca, culture, and, imposed, spanish, culture, onto, the, native, population, a, struggle, for, power, resulted, in, a, long, civil, war, between, francisco, pizarro, and, diego, de, almagro, in, which, almagro, was, killed, almagro, s, loyal, followers, and, his, descendants, later, avenged, his, death, by, killing, pizarro, in, 1541, this, was, done, inside, the, palace, of, francisco, pizarro, in, a, fight, to, the, death, by, these, assassins, most, of, which, were, former, soldiers, of, diego, de, almagro, who, were, stripped, of, title, and, belongings, after, his, death, despite, the, war, the, spaniards, did, not, neglect, the, colonizing, process, spanish, royal, authority, on, these, territories, was, consolidated, by, the, creation, of, an, audiencia, real, a, type, of, appellate, court, in, january, 1535, lima, was, founded, from, which, the, political, and, administrative, institutions, were, to, be, organized, in, 1542, the, spanish, created, the, viceroyalty, of, new, castile, that, shortly, after, would, be, called, viceroyalty, of, peru, nevertheless, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, was, not, organized, until, the, arrival, of, a, later, viceroy, francisco, de, toledo, in, 1569, toledo, ended, the, indigenous, neo, inca, state, in, vilcabamba, executing, the, inca, t, pac, amaru, he, resettled, the, indigenous, people, in, spanish, style, settlements, in, a, process, called, reductions, promoted, economic, development, using, commercial, monopoly, and, increased, the, production, of, the, silver, mines, of, potos, using, an, inca, institution, of, forced, labor, for, mandatory, public, service, called, mita, the, integration, of, spanish, culture, into, peru, was, carried, out, not, only, by, pizarro, and, his, other, captains, but, also, by, the, many, spanish, who, also, came, to, peru, to, exploit, its, riches, and, inhabit, its, land, these, included, many, different, kinds, of, immigrants, such, as, spanish, merchants, peasants, artisans, and, spanish, women, another, element, that, the, spanish, brought, with, them, were, african, slaves, to, work, alongside, captive, incas, for, use, in, labor, with, things, such, as, agriculture, and, mining, for, silver, these, people, all, brought, with, them, their, own, pieces, of, spanish, culture, to, integrate, into, peruvian, society, the, long, term, effects, of, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, on, the, population, of, south, america, were, catastrophic, while, this, was, the, case, for, every, group, of, native, americans, invaded, by, europeans, during, this, time, period, the, inca, population, suffered, an, exceptionally, dramatic, and, rapid, decline, following, contact, the, population, decline, for, the, inca, empire, from, 1520, to, 1571, is, roughly, estimated, at, from, 10, to, 12, million, in, 1520, to, less, than, 3, million, in, 1570, with, the, population, still, declining, after, 1570, the, single, greatest, cause, of, the, decimation, of, native, populations, was, old, world, infectious, diseases, carried, by, colonists, and, conquistadors, as, these, were, new, to, the, natives, they, had, no, acquired, immunity, and, suffered, very, high, rates, of, death, more, died, of, disease, than, any, army, or, armed, conflict, as, the, inca, did, not, have, as, strong, a, writing, tradition, as, the, aztec, or, maya, it, is, difficult, for, historians, to, estimate, population, decline, or, any, events, after, conquest, but, it, is, sometimes, argued, and, equally, disputed, among, scholars, that, the, inca, began, to, contract, these, diseases, several, years, before, the, spanish, appeared, in, the, region, as, it, was, possibly, carried, to, their, empire, by, traders, and, travelers, the, outbreak, argued, to, be, hemorrhagic, smallpox, reached, the, andes, in, 1524, while, numbers, are, unavailable, spanish, records, indicate, that, the, population, was, so, devastated, by, disease, that, they, could, hardly, resist, the, foreign, forces, historians, differ, as, to, whether, the, illness, of, the, 1520s, was, smallpox, a, minority, of, scholars, claim, that, the, epidemic, was, due, to, an, indigenous, illness, called, carrion, s, disease, in, any, case, a, 1981, study, by, n, d, cook, the, shows, that, the, andes, suffered, from, three, separate, population, declines, during, colonization, the, first, was, of, 30, 50, percent, during, the, first, outbreak, of, smallpox, when, a, measles, outbreak, occurred, there, was, another, decline, of, 25, 30, percent, finally, when, smallpox, and, measles, epidemics, occurred, together, which, occurred, from, 1585, to, 1591, a, decline, of, 30, 60, percent, occurred, collectively, these, declines, amounted, to, a, decline, of, 93, percent, from, the, pre, contact, population, in, the, andes, region, mortality, was, particularly, high, among, children, ensuring, that, the, impact, of, the, epidemics, would, extend, to, the, next, generation, beyond, the, devastation, of, the, local, populations, by, disease, they, suffered, considerable, enslavement, pillaging, and, destruction, from, warfare, the, spanish, took, thousands, of, women, from, the, local, natives, to, use, as, servants, and, concubines, as, pizarro, and, his, men, took, over, portions, of, south, america, they, plundered, and, enslaved, countless, people, some, local, populations, entered, into, vassalage, willingly, to, defeat, the, inca, native, groups, such, as, the, huanca, ca, ari, chanka, and, chachapoya, fought, alongside, the, spanish, as, they, opposed, inca, rule, the, basic, policy, of, the, spanish, towards, local, populations, was, that, voluntary, vassalage, would, yield, safety, and, coexistence, while, continued, resistance, would, result, in, more, deaths, and, destruction, another, significant, effect, on, the, people, in, south, america, was, the, spread, of, christianity, as, pizarro, and, the, spanish, subdued, the, continent, and, brought, it, under, their, control, they, forcefully, converted, many, to, christianity, claiming, to, have, educated, them, in, the, ways, of, the, one, true, religion, with, the, depopulation, of, the, local, populations, along, with, the, capitulation, of, the, inca, empire, the, spanish, missionary, work, after, colonization, began, was, able, to, continue, unimpeded, it, took, just, a, generation, for, the, entire, continent, to, be, under, christian, influence, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, also, had, an, unexpected, impact, on, the, land, itself, recent, research, points, out, that, the, spanish, conquest, altered, peru, s, shoreline, before, the, spaniards, arrived, inhabitants, of, the, arid, northern, peruvian, coast, clad, massive, sandy, ridges, with, an, accidental, form, of, armor, millions, of, discarded, mollusk, shells, which, protected, the, ridges, from, erosion, for, nearly, 4700, years, prior, to, the, spanish, arrival, and, produced, a, vast, corrugated, landscape, that, is, visible, from, space, this, incidental, landscape, protection, came, to, a, swift, end, however, after, diseases, brought, by, spanish, colonists, decimated, the, local, population, and, after, colonial, officials, resettled, the, survivors, inland, without, humans, to, create, the, protective, covering, newly, formed, beach, ridges, simply, eroded, and, vanished, according, to, archaeologist, torben, rick, parts, of, the, northern, coast, of, peru, may, look, completely, natural, and, pristine, but, if, you, rewind, the, clock, a, couple, of, millennia, you,
