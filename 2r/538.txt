with, the, invasion, of, iraq, by, the, united, states, led, coalition, that, overthrew, the, ba, athist, government, of, saddam, hussein, the, conflict, continued, for, much, of, the, next, decade, as, an, insurgency, emerged, to, oppose, the, coalition, forces, and, the, post, invasion, iraqi, government, us, troops, were, officially, withdrawn, in, 2011, the, united, states, became, re, involved, in, 2014, at, the, head, of, a, new, coalition, the, insurgency, and, many, dimensions, of, the, armed, conflict, are, ongoing, the, invasion, occurred, as, part, of, the, george, w, bush, administration, s, war, on, terror, following, the, september, 11, attacks, in, 2001, in, the, united, states, in, october, 2002, the, united, states, congress, passed, a, joint, resolution, that, granted, bush, the, power, to, use, military, force, against, the, iraqi, government, the, iraq, war, officially, began, on, 20, march, 2003, when, the, us, joined, by, the, united, kingdom, australia, and, poland, launched, a, shock, and, awe, bombing, campaign, shortly, following, the, bombing, campaign, us, led, forces, launched, a, ground, invasion, of, iraq, iraqi, forces, were, quickly, overwhelmed, as, coalition, forces, swept, through, the, country, the, invasion, led, to, the, collapse, of, the, ba, athist, government, saddam, hussein, was, captured, during, operation, red, dawn, in, december, of, that, same, year, and, executed, three, years, later, the, power, vacuum, following, saddam, s, demise, and, mismanagement, by, the, coalition, provisional, authority, led, to, widespread, civil, war, between, shias, and, sunnis, as, well, as, a, lengthy, insurgency, against, coalition, forces, the, united, states, responded, with, a, build, up, of, 170, 000, troops, in, 2007, this, build, up, gave, greater, control, to, iraq, s, government, and, military, while, also, giving, the, united, states, a, greater, say, in, the, postwar, reconstruction, of, iraq, in, 2008, president, bush, agreed, to, a, withdrawal, of, all, us, combat, troops, from, iraq, the, withdrawal, was, completed, under, barack, obama, in, december, 2011, the, united, states, based, most, of, its, rationale, for, the, invasion, on, claims, that, iraq, had, a, weapons, of, mass, destruction, wmd, program, and, that, saddam, hussein, was, supporting, al, qaeda, the, us, government, had, also, alleged, that, al, qaeda, was, secretly, co, operating, with, iraq, to, build, weapons, of, mass, destruction, and, argued, that, iraq, posed, a, threat, to, the, united, states, and, its, allies, however, in, 2004, the, 9, 11, commission, concluded, that, there, was, no, evidence, of, any, relationship, between, saddam, s, regime, and, al, qaeda, no, stockpiles, of, wmds, or, active, wmd, program, were, ever, found, in, iraq, bush, administration, officials, had, also, made, numerous, claims, about, a, purported, saddam, al, qaeda, relationship, and, wmds, that, were, based, on, insufficient, evidence, rejected, by, intelligence, officials, the, rationale, for, the, iraq, war, faced, heavy, criticism, both, domestically, and, internationally, kofi, annan, then, the, secretary, general, of, the, united, nations, called, the, invasion, illegal, under, international, law, as, it, had, violated, the, un, charter, the, 2016, chilcot, report, a, british, inquiry, into, the, united, kingdom, s, decision, to, go, to, war, concluded, that, not, every, peaceful, alternative, had, been, examined, that, the, uk, and, us, had, undermined, the, united, nations, security, council, in, the, process, of, declaring, war, that, the, process, of, identification, for, a, legal, basis, of, war, was, far, from, satisfactory, and, that, these, conclusions, taken, together, the, war, was, unnecessary, when, interrogated, by, the, fbi, saddam, hussein, confirmed, that, iraq, did, not, have, weapons, of, mass, destruction, prior, to, the, us, invasion, although, the, iraq, survey, group, did, find, that, saddam, had, the, aim, of, wmd, proliferation, and, maintained, the, laboratories, and, scientists, necessary, for, wmd, development, in, 2005,

domestic, popularity, and, public, image, it, also, reduced, uk, prime, minister, tony, blair, s, popularity, leading, to, his, resignation, in, 2007, strong, international, opposition, to, the, saddam, hussein, regime, began, following, iraq, s, invasion, of, kuwait, in, 1990, the, international, community, condemned, the, invasion, and, in, 1991, a, military, coalition, led, by, the, united, states, launched, the, gulf, war, to, expel, iraqi, forces, from, kuwait, following, the, gulf, war, the, us, and, its, allies, tried, to, keep, saddam, hussein, in, check, with, a, policy, of, containment, this, policy, involved, numerous, economic, sanctions, by, the, un, security, council, the, enforcement, of, iraqi, no, fly, zones, declared, by, the, us, and, the, uk, to, protect,

united, nations, passed, 16, security, council, resolutions, calling, for, the, complete, elimination, of, iraqi, weapons, of, mass, destruction, member, states, communicated, their, frustration, over, the, years, that, iraq, was, impeding, the, work, of, the, special, commission, and, failing, to, take, seriously, its, disarmament, obligations, iraqi, officials, harassed, the, inspectors, and, obstructed, their, work, and, in, august, 1998, the, iraqi, government, suspended, cooperation, with, the, inspectors, completely, alleging, that, the, inspectors, were, spying, for, the, us, the, spying, allegations, were, later, substantiated, in, october, 1998, removing, the, iraqi, government, became, official, us, foreign, policy, with, the, enactment, of, the, iraq, liberation, act, the, act, provided, 97, million, for, iraqi, democratic, opposition, organizations, to, establish, a, program, to, support, a, transition, to, democracy, in, iraq, this, legislation, contrasted, with, the, terms, set, out, in, united, nations, security, council, resolution, 687, which, focused, on, weapons, and, weapons, programs, and, made, no, mention, of, regime, change, one, month, after, the, passage, of, the, iraq, liberation, act, the, us, and, uk, launched, a, bombardment, campaign, of, iraq, called, operation, desert, fox, the, campaign, s, express, rationale, was, to, hamper, saddam, hussein, s, government, s, ability, to, produce, chemical, biological, and, nuclear, weapons, but, us, intelligence, personnel, also, hoped, it, would, help, weaken, saddam, s, grip, on, power, following, the, election, of, george, w, bush, as, president, in, 2000, the, us, moved, towards, a, more, aggressive, iraq, policy, the, republican, party, s, campaign, platform, in, the, 2000,

the, september, 11, attacks, although, plans, were, drafted, and, meetings, were, held, from, the, first, days, of, his, administration, following, 9, 11, the, bush, administration, s, national, security, team, actively, debated, an, invasion, of, iraq, on, the, day, of, the, attacks, secretary, of, defense, donald, rumsfeld, asked, his, aides, for, best, info, fast, judge, whether, good, enough, hit, saddam, hussein, at, the, same, time, not, only, osama, bin, laden, president, bush, spoke, with, rumsfeld, on, 21, november, and, instructed, him, to, conduct, a, confidential, review, of, oplan, 1003, the, war, plan, for, invading, iraq, rumsfeld, met, with, general, tommy, franks, the, commander, of, us, central, command, on, 27, november, to, go, over, the, plans, a, record, of, the, meeting, includes, the, question, how, start, listing, multiple, possible, justifications, for, a, us, iraq, war, the, rationale, for, invading, iraq, as, a, response, to, 9, 11, has, been, refuted, as, there, was, no, cooperation, between, saddam, hussein, and, al, qaeda, president, bush, began, laying, the, public, groundwork, for, an, invasion, of, iraq, in, january, 2002, state, of, the, union, address, calling, iraq, a, member, of, the, axis, of, evil, and, saying, the, united, states, of, america, will, not, permit, the, world, s, most, dangerous, regimes, to, threaten, us, with, the, world, s, most, destructive, weapons, bush, said, this, and, made, many, other, dire, allegations, about, the, threat, of, iraqi, weapons, of, mass, destruction, despite, the, fact, that, the, bush, administration, knew, that, iraq, had, no, nuclear, weapons, and, had, no, information, about, whether, iraq, had, biological, weapons, he, began, formally, making, his, case, to, the, international, community, for, an, invasion, of, iraq, in, his, 12, september, 2002, address, to, the, un, security, council, however, a, 5, september, 2002, report, from, major, general, glen, shaffer, revealed, that, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, s, j2, intelligence, directorate, had, concluded, that, the, united, states, knowledge, on, different, aspects, of, the, iraqi, wmd, program, ranged, from, essentially, zero, to, about, 75, and, that, knowledge, was, particularly, weak, on, aspects, of, a, possible, nuclear, weapons, program, our, knowledge, of, the, iraqi, nuclear, weapons, program, is, based, largely, perhaps, 90, on, analysis, of, imprecise, intelligence, they, concluded, our, assessments, rely, heavily, on, analytic, assumptions, and, judgment, rather, than, hard, evidence, the, evidentiary, base, is, particularly, sparse, for, iraqi, nuclear, programs, similarly, the, british, government, found, no, evidence, that, iraq, possessed, nuclear, weapons, or, any, other, weapons, of, mass, destruction, and, that, iraq, posed, no, threat, to, the, west, a, conclusion, british, diplomats, shared, with, the, us, government, key, us, allies, in, nato, such, as, the, united, kingdom, agreed, with, the, us, actions, while, france, and, germany, were, critical, of, plans, to, invade, iraq, arguing, instead, for, continued, diplomacy, and, weapons, inspections, after, considerable, debate, the, un, security, council, adopted, a, compromise, resolution, un, security, council, resolution, 1441, which, authorized, the, resumption, of, weapons, inspections, and, promised, serious, consequences, for, non, compliance, security, council, members, france, and, russia, made, clear, that, they, did, not, consider, these, consequences, to, include, the, use, of, force, to, overthrow, the, iraqi, government, the, us, and, uk, ambassadors, to, the, un, publicly, confirmed, this, reading, of, the, resolution, resolution, 1441, set, up, inspections, by, the, united, nations, monitoring, verification, and, inspection, commission, unmovic, and, the, international, atomic, energy, agency, saddam, accepted, the, resolution, on, 13, november, and, inspectors, returned, to, iraq, under, the, direction, of, unmovic, chairman, hans, blix, and, iaea, director, general, mohamed, elbaradei, as, of, february, 2003, the, iaea, found, no, evidence, or, plausible, indication, of, the, revival, of, a, nuclear, weapons, program, in, iraq, the, iaea, concluded, that, certain, items, which, could, have, been, used, in, nuclear, enrichment, centrifuges, such, as, aluminum, tubes, were, in, fact, intended, for, other, uses, in, march, 2003, blix, said, progress, had, been, made, in, inspections, and, no, evidence, of, wmd, had, been, found, in, october, 2002, the, us, congress, passed, the, iraq, resolution, which, authorized, the, president, to, use, any, means, necessary, against, iraq, americans, polled, in, january, 2003, widely, favored, further, diplomacy, over, an, invasion, later, that, year, however, americans, began, to, agree, with, bush, s, plan, see, popular, opinion, in, the, united, states, on, the, invasion, of, iraq, the, us, government, engaged, in, an, elaborate, domestic, public, relations, campaign, to, promote, the, war, to, its, citizens, americans, overwhelmingly, believed, saddam, did, have, weapons, of, mass, destruction, 85, said, so, even, though, the, inspectors, had, not, uncovered, those, weapons, by, february, 2003, 64, of, americans, supported, taking, military, action, to, remove, saddam, from, power, on, 5, february, 2003, secretary, of, state, colin, powell, appeared, before, the, un, to, present, evidence, that, iraq, was, hiding, unconventional, weapons, however, despite, warnings, from, the, german, federal, intelligence, service, and, the, british, secret, intelligence, service, that, the, source, was, untrustworthy, powell, s, presentation, included, information, based, on, the, claims, of, rafid, ahmed, alwan, al, janabi, codenamed, curveball, an, iraqi, emigrant, living, in, germany, who, also, later, admitted, that, his, claims, had, been, false, powell, also, claimed, that, iraq, was, covertly, harbouring, and, supporting, al, qaeda, networks, additionally, powell, alleged, that, al, qaeda, was, attempting, to, acquire, weapons, of, mass, destruction, from, iraq, al, qaida, continues, to, have, a, deep, interest, in, acquiring, weapons, of, mass, destruction, as, with, the, story, of, zarqawi, and, his, network, i, can, trace, the, story, of, a, senior, terrorist, operative, telling, how, iraq, provided, training, in, these, weapons, to, al, qaida, fortunately, this, operative, is, now, detained, and, he, has, told, his, story, the, support, that, this, detainee, describes, included, iraq, offering, chemical, or, biological, weapons, training, for, two, al, qaida, associates, beginning, in, december, 2000, he, says, that, a, militant,

war, and, that, the, idea, that, it, would, take, several, hundred, thousand, us, forces, is, far, from, the, mark, deputy, defense, secretary, paul, wolfowitz, said, shinseki, s, estimate, was, way, off, the, mark, because, other, countries, would, take, part, in, an, occupying, force, germany, s, foreign, secretary, joschka, fischer, although, having, been, in, favor, of, stationing, german,

2004, was, marked, by, a, relative, lull, in, violence, insurgent, forces, reorganised, during, this, time, studying, the, multinational, forces, tactics, and, planning, a, renewed, offensive, however, violence, did, increase, during, the, iraq, spring, fighting, of, 2004, with, foreign, fighters, from, around, the, middle, east, as, well, as, jama, at, al, tawhid, wal, jihad, an, al, qaeda, linked, group, led, by, abu, musab, al, zarqawi, helping, to, drive, the, insurgency, as, the, insurgency, grew, there, was, a, distinct, change, in, targeting, from, the, coalition, forces, towards, the, new, iraqi, security, forces, as, hundreds, of, iraqi, civilians, and, police, were, killed, over, the, next, few, months, in, a, series, of, massive, bombings, an, organized, sunni, insurgency, with, deep, roots, and, both, nationalist, and, islamist, motivations, was, becoming, more, powerful, throughout, iraq, the, shia, mahdi, army, also, began, launching, attacks, on, coalition, targets, in, an, attempt, to, seize, control, from, iraqi, security, forces, the, southern, and, central, portions, of, iraq, were, beginning, to, erupt, in, urban, guerrilla, combat, as, multinational, forces, attempted, to, keep, control, and, prepared, for, a, counteroffensive, the, most, serious, fighting, of, the, war, so, far, began, on, 31, march, 2004, when, iraqi, insurgents, in, fallujah, ambushed, a, blackwater, usa, convoy, led, by, four, us, private, military, contractors, who, were, providing, security, for, food, caterers, eurest, support, services, the, four, armed,

2004, the, offensive, was, resumed, in, november, 2004, in, the, bloodiest, battle, of, the, war, the, second, battle, of, fallujah, described, by, the, us, military, as, the, heaviest, urban, combat, that, they, had, been, involved, in, since, the, battle, of, hue, city, in, vietnam, during, the, assault, us, forces, used, white, phosphorus, as, an, incendiary, weapon, against, insurgent,

275, 000, in, 2016, the, foreign, policy, association, reported, that, perhaps, the, most, perplexing, component, of, the, iraq, refugee, crisis, has, been, the, inability, for, the, united, states, to, absorb, more, iraqis, following, the, 2003, invasion, of, the, country, to, date, the, united, states, has, granted, around, 84, 000, iraqis, refugee, status, of, the, more, than, two, million, global, iraqi, refugees, by, contrast, the, united, states, granted, asylum, to, more, than, 100, 000, south, vietnamese, refugees, during, the, vietnam, war, the, war, has, led, to, oil, spills, which, increased, carbon, emissions, and, contaminated, the, surrounding, water, resources, during, the, invasion, period, the, retreating, iraqi, army, damaged, the, oil, infrastructure, and, destroyed, more, than, 736, oil, wells, in, southern, iraq, resulting, in, massive, oil, spills, and, the, ignition, of, fires, in, 2003, more, than, 50, billion, tonnes, of, carbon, emissions, were, produced, from, burning, oil, fields, and, released, into, the, atmosphere, also, over, 130, million, gallons, of, oil, leaked, into, surrounding, water, resources, such, as, sawa, lake, between, 2003, and, 2010, more, than, 5, 000, birds, from, three, species, died, around, sawa, lake, the, u, s, led, coalition, used, depleted, uranium, du, munitions, during, the, war, to, pierce, tank,

seeds, from, sprouting, with, about, 22, 9, 5, million, ha, of, the, farmland, in, iraq, unable, to, grow, barley, in, addition, radiation, contamination, may, have, had, harmful, public, health, outcomes, through, poisoning, and, increased, incidence, of, various, cancers, and, birth, defects, several, studies, have, identified, increased, occurrence, of, deformities, cancers, and, other, serious, health, problems, in, areas, where, du, shells, were, used, some, iraqi, doctors, attributed, these, malformations, to, possible, long, term, effects, of, depleted, uranium, studies, disagree, on, whether, du, ammunition, has, any, measurable, detrimental, health, effects, according, to, research, from, the, uk, atomic, energy, authority, in, 2005, the, cancer, rate, had, increased, by, 35, since, 2003, as, of, 2013, 140, 000, iraqis, were, suffering, from, cancer, with, between, 7, 000, and, 8, 000, new, cases, yearly, according, to, a, 2012, journal, article, by, al, hadithi, et, al, existing, studies, and, research, evidence, does, not, show, a, clear, increase, in, birth, defects, or, a, clear, indication, of, a, possible, environmental, exposure, including, depleted, uranium, the, article, further, states, that, there, is, actually, no, substantial, evidence, that, genetic, defects, can, arise, from, parental, exposure, to, du, in, any, circumstances, the, war, has, also, led, to, damage, to, ecosystems, though, pollution, and, physical, destruction, approximately, 25, 000, tons, of, bombs, were, dropped, by, the, u, s, military, during, the, war, more, than, 250, chemical, and, armament, factories, were, destroyed, which, caused, over, 50, 000, cubic, meters, of, hazardous, chemicals, such, as, fertilizer, and, raw, sewage, to, leak, into, water, leading, to, surrounding, freshwater, ecosystem, becoming, polluted, and, species, habitat, being, impacted, according, to, the, world, wide, fund, for, nature, 33, iraqi, wetlands, especially, the, mesopotamian, marshland, have, been, contaminated, by, chemicals, which, has, caused, 60, types, of, mammal, species, to, lose, their, habitats, and, more, than, 45, types, of, plants, to, become, extinct, though, explicitly, stating, that, iraq, had, nothing, to, do, with, 9, 11, erstwhile, president, george, w, bush, consistently, referred, to, the, iraq, war, as, the, central, front, in, the, war, on, terror, and, argued, that, if, the, united, states, pulled, out, of, iraq, terrorists, will, follow, us, here, while, other, proponents, of, the, war, regularly, echoed, this, assertion, as, the, conflict, dragged, on, members, of, the, us, congress, the, us, public, and, even, us, troops, questioned, the, connection, between, iraq, and, the, fight, against, anti, us, terrorism, in, particular, a, consensus, developed, among, intelligence, experts, that, the, iraq, war, actually, increased, terrorism, counterterrorism, expert, rohan, gunaratna, frequently, referred, to, the, invasion, of, iraq, as, a, fatal, mistake, london, s, international, institute, for, strategic, studies, concluded, in, 2004, that, the, occupation, of, iraq, had, become, a, potent, global, recruitment, pretext, for, mujahideen, and, that, the, invasion, galvanised, al, qaeda, and, perversely, inspired, insurgent, violence, there, the, us, national, intelligence, council, concluded, in, a, january, 2005, report, that, the, war, in, iraq, had, become, a, breeding, ground, for, a, new, generation, of, terrorists, david, low, the, national, intelligence, officer, for, transnational, threats, indicated, that, the, report, concluded, that, the, war, in, iraq, provided, terrorists, with, a, training, ground, a, recruitment, ground, the, opportunity, for, enhancing, technical, skills, there, is, even, under, the, best, scenario, over, time, the, likelihood, that, some, of, the, jihadists, who, are, not, killed, there, will, in, a, sense, go, home, wherever, home, is, and, will, therefore, disperse, to, various, other, countries, the, council, s, chairman, robert, hutchings, said, at, the, moment, iraq, is, a, magnet, for, international, terrorist, activity, and, the, 2006, national, intelligence, estimate, which, outlined, the, considered, judgment, of, all, 16, us, intelligence, agencies, held, that, the, iraq, conflict, has, become, the, cause, c, l, bre, for, jihadists, breeding, a, deep, resentment, of, us, involvement, in, the, muslim, world, and, cultivating, supporters, for, the, global, jihadist, movement, a, report, by, the, council, on, foreign, relations, released, on, the, 20th, anniversary, of, the, invasion, analyzed, the, rationale, to, go, to, war, and, the, subsequent, decisions, during, the, occupation, the, report, states, that, the, justification, for, going, to, war, was, based, on, scanty, and, deeply, flawed, intelligence, and, that, the, invasion, was, an, error, compounded, by, the, absence, of, an, agreed, exit, strategy, and, the, decision, to, embark, on, a, massive, open, ended, nation, building, project, the, same, report, also, ascertained, that, the, occupation, authority, s, first, acts, were, to, disband, the, iraqi, army, and, the, ba, athist, governing, party, igniting, what, would, become, a, lethal, long, running, insurgency, and, eventually, a, multinational, terrorist, organization, that, took, over, most, of, the, country, from, a, geopolitical, perspective, the, war, in, iraq, has, been, interpreted, as, weakening, the, west, s, moral, high, ground, and, hampering, its, ability, to, effectively, counter, russia, and, china, with, regard, to, the, russo, ukrainian, war, russian, foreign, minister, sergey, lavrov, said, in, march, 2022, that, the, u, s, exerted, similar, pressures, on, iraq, in, 2003, which, the, us, invaded, later, for, no, reason, other, than, a, vial, of, unidentified, chemicals, in, march, 2023, tony, blair, former, british, prime, minister, rejected, comparisons, between, russia, s, war, in, ukraine, and, the, us, led, invasion, of, iraq, claiming, that, the, iraq, war, cannot, be, used, as, a, justification, by, russia, to, annex, russian, speaking, zones, in, eastern, ukraine, the, bush, administration, s, rationale, for, the, iraq, war, has, faced, heavy, criticism, from, an, array, of, popular, and, official, sources, both, inside, and, outside, the, united, states, with, many, us, citizens, finding, many, parallels, with, the, vietnam, war, for, example, a, former, cia, officer, described, the, office, of, special, plans, as, a, group, of, ideologues, who, were, dangerous, to, us, national, security, and, a, threat, to, world, peace, and, stated, that, the, group, lied, and, manipulated, intelligence, to, further, its, agenda, of, removing, saddam, the, center, for, public, integrity, stated, that, the, bush, administration, made, a, total, of, 935, false, statements, between, 2001, and, 2003, about, iraq, s, alleged, threat, to, the, united, states, both, proponents, and, opponents, of, the, invasion, have, also, criticized, the, prosecution, of, the, war, effort, along, with, a, number, of, other, lines, most, significantly, critics, have, assailed, the, united, states, and, its, allies, for, not, devoting, enough, troops, to, the, mission, not, adequately, planning, for, post, invasion, iraq, and, for, permitting, and, perpetrating, human, rights, abuses, as, the, war, has, progressed, critics, have, also, railed, against, the, high, human, and, financial, costs, in, 2016, the, united, kingdom, published, the, iraq, inquiry, a, public, inquiry, which, was, broadly, critical, of, the, actions, of, the, british, government, and, military, in, making, the, case, for, the, war, in, tactics, and, in, planning, for, the, aftermath, of, the, war, criticisms, include, throughout, the, war, many, human, rights, abuses, and, war, crimes, were, committed, the, post, invasion, iraqi, government, used, torture, against, detainees, including, children, some, techniques, of, torture, used, included, beatings, electric, shocks, prolonged, hanging, by, the, wrists, food, and, water, deprivation, and, blindfolding, for, multiple, days, iraqi, police, from, the, interior, ministry, were, accused, of, forming, death, squads, and, committing, numerous, massacres, of, sunni, arabs, many, of, these, human, rights, abuses, were, carried, out, by, iraqi, government, sponsored, shi, ite, militias, in, a, march, 2003, gallup, poll, the, day, after, the, invasion, 76, of, americans, had, approved, of, military, action, against, iraq, in, a, march, 2003, yougov, poll, 54, of, britons, supported, the, military, action, against, iraq, a, remarkable, aspect, was, the,

unjustified, and, in, the, uk, were, critical, of, their, government, s, support, of, us, policies, in, iraq, according, to, polls, conducted, by, the, arab, american, institute, four, years, after,

in, 2006, majorities, in, the, netherlands, germany, jordan, france, lebanon, russia, china, canada, poland, pakistan, spain, indonesia, turkey, and, morocco, believed, the, world, was, safer, before, the, iraq, war, and, the, toppling, of, saddam, while, pluralities, in, the, united, states, and, india, believe, the, world, is, safer, without, saddam, hussein, directly, after, the, invasion, an, ndtv, poll, of, baghdad, residents, reported, a, slight, majority, of, respondents, supported, the, us, invasion, polls, conducted, between, 2005, and, 2007, showed, 31, 37, of, iraqis, wanted, us, and, other, coalition, forces, to, withdraw, once, security, was, restored, and, that, 26, 35, wanted, immediate, withdrawal, instead, in, 2006, a, poll, conducted, on, the, iraqi, public, revealed, that, 52, of, the, ones, polled, said, iraq, was, going, in, the, right, direction, and, 61, claimed, it, was, worth, ousting, saddam, hussein, in, a, march, 2007, bbc, poll, 82, of, iraqis, expressed, a, lack, of, confidence, in, coalition, forces, based, in, iraq, according, to, a, 2009, poll, conducted, by, the, university, of, maryland, 7, out, of, 10, iraqis, wanted, us, troops, to, withdraw, within, one, year, and, also, 78, felt, that, us, military, presence, was, provoking, more, conflict, than, it, is, preventing, despite, a, majority, having, previously, been, opposed, to, the, us, presence, according, to, a, poll, conducted, by, the, asharq, research, centre, a, private, iraqi, company, 60, of, iraqis, had, believed, it, was, the, wrong, time, for, a, major, withdrawal, of, american, troops, prior, to, the, withdrawal, in, 2011, with, 51, saying, withdrawal, would, have, a, negative, effect, according, to, studies, most, of, the, suicide, bombers, in,

january, 2007, iraqi, prime, minister, nouri, al, maliki, stated, that, iran, was, supporting, attacks, against, coalition, forces, in, iraq, and, some, iraqis, suspect, that, the, raid, may, have, been, perpetrated, by, the, quds, force, in, retaliation, for, the, detention, of, five, iranian, officials, by, us, forces, in, the, northern, iraqi, city, of, irbil, on, 11, january, in, 2014, the, legacy, of, iran, s, presence, in, iraq, after, the, invasion, had, been, mixed, with, regard, to, the, fight, against, regional, terrorist, groups, the, u, s, occupation, and, subsequent, regional, instability, had, spawned, the, creation, of, the, pmf, popular, mobilization, forces, an, iranian, militia, that, effectively, fought, the, influence, of, emerging, caliphates, in, the, region, later, a, 1, 300, page, us, army, iraq, war, study, released, in, january, 2019, concluded, that, at, the, time, of, this, project, s, completion, in, 2018, an, emboldened, and, expansionist, iran, appears, to, be, the, only, victor, and, that, the, outcome, of, the, war, triggered, a, deep, skepticism, about, foreign, interventions, among, america, s, public, opinion, israel, did, not, officially, support, or, take, part, in, the, iraq, war, according, to, former, state, department, official, lawrence, wilkerson, and, former, cia, agent, and, iran, expert, robert, baer, israeli, officials, warned, the, bush, administration, against, invading, iraq, saying, that, it, would, destabilize, the, region, and, empower, the, much, more, dangerous, regime, in, iran, however, it, was, reported, in, the, washington, post, that, israel, is, urging, united, states, officials, not, to, delay, a, military, strike, against, iraq, s, saddam, hussein, it, was, also, reported, in, 2002, that, israeli, intelligence, provided, washington, with, alarming, reports, about, iraq, s, alleged, program, to, develop, weapons, of, mass, destruction, according, to, former, us, undersecretary, of, defense, douglas, feith, israeli, officials, did, not, push, their, american, counterparts, to, initiate, the, war, in, iraq, in, an, interview, with, ynet, feith, stated, that, what, you, heard, from, the, israelis, was, not, any, kind, of, advocacy, of, war, with, iraq, and, that, hat, you, heard, from, israeli, officials, in, private, discussions, was, that, they, were, not, really, focused, on, iraq, hey, were, much, more, focused, on, iran, at, washington, s, behest, israel, did, not, provide, vocal, support, for, the, war, as, the, us, government, was, concerned, that, israeli, support, for, or, participation, in, the, war, would, potentially, alienate, the, arab, world, in, january, 2007, the, forward, reported, that, sometime, before, march, 2003, israeli, prime, minister, ariel, sharon, told, bush, that, israel, would, not, push, one, way, or, the, other, for, or, against, an, iraq, war, sharon, said, that, he, believed, that, iraq, was, a, genuine, threat, to, the, middle, east, and, that, saddam, had, weapons, of, mass, destruction, but, explicitly, warned, bush, that, if, the, us, did, go, to, war, with, iraq, that, he, should, make, sure, to, formulate, a, viable, exit, strategy, prepare, a, counterinsurgency, strategy, and, should, not, attempt, to, implant, democracy, in, the, arab, world, one, of, the, sources, who, provided, this, information, was, israeli, ambassador, to, the, us, daniel, ayalon, israel, has, also, assisted, the, us, military, by, sharing, its, expertise, on, counterinsurgency, methods, such, as, utilizing, drones, and, operating, checkpoints, the, invasion, of, iraq, prompted, a, widespread, wave, of, criticism, from, several, world, leaders, including, russian, president, vladimir, putin, before, and, during, the, invasion, of, iraq, the, russian, government, provided, intelligence, to, saddam, hussein, about, the, location, of, us, forces, and, their, plans
