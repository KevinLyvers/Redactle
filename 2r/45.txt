events, artifacts, north, to, south, events, artifacts, artifacts, the, history, of, the, philippines, dates, from, the, earliest, hominin, activity, in, the, archipelago, at, least, by, 709, 000, years, ago, homo, luzonensis, a, species, of, archaic, humans, was, present, on, the, island, of, luzon, at, least, by, 134, 000, years, ago, the, earliest, known, anatomically, modern, human, was, from, tabon, caves, in, palawan, dating, about, 47, 000, years, negrito, groups, were, the, first, inhabitants, to, settle, in, the, prehistoric, philippines, these, were, followed, by, austroasiatics, papuans, and, south, asians, by, around, 3000, bce, seafaring, austronesians, who, form, the, majority, of, the, current, population, migrated, southward, from, taiwan, by, 2000, bce, the, archipelago, was, the, crux, of, a, trans, oceanic, philippine, jade, culture, scholars, generally, believe, that, these, ethnic, and, social, groups, eventually, developed, into, various, settlements, or, polities, with, varying, degrees, of, economic, specialization, social, stratification, and, political, organization, some, of, these, settlements, mostly, those, located, on, major, river, deltas, achieved, such, a, scale, of, social, complexity, that, some, scholars, believe, they, should, be, considered, early, states, this, includes, the, predecessors, of, modern, day, population, centers, such, as, manila, tondo, pangasinan, cebu, panay, bohol, butuan, cotabato, lanao, zamboanga, and, sulu, as, well, as, some, polities, such, as, ma, i, whose, possible, location, is, either, mindoro, or, laguna, these, polities, were, influenced, by, islamic, indian, and, chinese, cultures, islam, arrived, from, arabia, while, indian, hindu, buddhist, religion, language, culture, literature, and, philosophy, arrived, through, expeditions, such, as, the, south, east, asia, campaign, of, rajendra, chola, i, some, polities, were, sinified, tributary, states, allied, to, china, these, small, maritime, states, flourished, from, the, 1st, millennium, these, kingdoms, traded, with, what, are, now, called, china, india, japan, thailand, vietnam, and, indonesia, the, remainder, of, the, settlements, were, independent, barangays, allied, with, one, of, the, larger, states, these, small, states, alternated, from, being, part, of, or, being, influenced, by, larger, asian, empires, like, the, ming, dynasty, majapahit, and, brunei, or, rebelling, and, waging, war, against, them, the, first, recorded, visit, by, europeans, is, ferdinand, magellan, s, expedition, which, landed, in, homonhon, island, now, part, of, guiuan, eastern, samar, on, march, 17, 1521, they, lost, a, battle, against, the, army, of, lapulapu, chief, of, mactan, where, magellan, was, killed, the, spanish, philippines, began, with, the, pacific, expansion, of, new, spain, and, the, arrival, of, miguel, l, pez, de, legazpi, s, expedition, on, february, 13, 1565, from, mexico, he, established, the, first, permanent, settlement, in, cebu, much, of, the, archipelago, came, under, spanish, rule, creating, the, first, unified, political, structure, known, as, the, philippines, spanish, colonial, rule, saw, the, introduction, of, christianity, the, code, of, law, and, the, oldest, modern, university, in, asia, the, philippines, was, ruled, under, the, mexico, based, viceroyalty, of, new, spain, after, this, the, colony, was, directly, governed, by, spain, following, mexico, s, independence, spanish, rule, ended, in, 1898, with, spain, s, defeat, in, the, spanish, american, war, the, philippines, then, became, a, territory, of, the, united, states, u, s, forces, suppressed, a, revolution, led, by, emilio, aguinaldo, the, united, states, established, the, insular, government, to, rule, the, philippines, in, 1907, the, elected, philippine, assembly, was, set, up, with, popular, elections, the, u, s, promised, independence, in, the, jones, act, the, philippine, commonwealth, was, established, in, 1935, as, a, 10, year, interim, step, prior, to, full, independence, however, in, 1942, during, world, war, ii, japan, occupied, the, philippines, the, u, s, military, overpowered, the, japanese, in, 1945, the, treaty, of, manila, in, 1946, established, the, independent, philippine, republic, stone, tools, and, fossils, of, butchered, animal, remains, discovered, in, rizal, kalinga, are, evidences, of, early, hominins, in, the, country, to, as, early, as, 709, 000, years, researchers, found, 57, stone, tools, near, rhinoceros, bones, bearing, cut, marks, and, some, bones, smashed, open, suggesting, that, the, early, humans, were, after, the, nutrient, rich, marrow, a, 2023, study, dated, the, age, of, fossilized, remains, of, homo, luzonensis, of, cagayan, at, about, 134, 000, years, this, and, the, angono, petroglyphs, in, rizal, suggest, the, presence, of, human, settlement, before, the, arrival, of, the, negritos, and, austronesian, speaking, people, the, callao, man, remains, and, 12, bones, of, three, hominin, individuals, found, by, subsequent, excavations, in, callao, cave, were, later, identified, to, belong, in, a, new, species, named, homo, luzonensis, for, modern, humans, the, tabon, man, remains, are, the, still, oldest, known, at, about, 47, 000, years, the, negritos, were, early, settlers, but, their, appearance, in, the, philippines, has, not, been, reliably, dated, they, were, followed, by, speakers, of, the, malayo, polynesian, languages, a, branch, of, the, austronesian, language, family, the, first, austronesians, reached, the, philippines, at, 3000, 2200, bce, settling, the, batanes, islands, and, northern, luzon, from, there, they, rapidly, spread, downwards, to, the, rest, of, the, islands, of, the, philippines, and, southeast, asia, as, well, as, voyaging, further, east, to, reach, the, northern, mariana, islands, by, around, 1500, bce, they, assimilated, the, earlier, australo, melanesian, negritos, resulting, in, the, modern, filipino, ethnic, groups, that, all, display, various, ratios, of, genetic, admixture, between, austronesian, and, negrito, groups, before, the, expansion, out, of, taiwan, archaeological, linguistic, and, genetic, evidence, had, linked, austronesian, speakers, in, insular, southeast, asia, to, cultures, such, as, the, hemudu, its, successor, the, liangzhu, and, dapenkeng, in, neolithic, china, the, most, widely, accepted, theory, of, the, population, of, the, islands, is, the, out, of, taiwan, model, that, follows, the, austronesian, expansion, during, the, neolithic, in, a, series, of, maritime, migrations, originating, from, taiwan, that, spread, to, the, islands, of, the, indo, pacific, ultimately, reaching, as, far, as, new, zealand, easter, island, and, madagascar, austronesians, themselves, originated, from, the, neolithic, rice, cultivating, pre, austronesian, civilizations, of, the, yangtze, river, delta, in, coastal, southeastern, china, pre, dating, the, conquest, of, those, regions, by, the, han, chinese, this, includes, civilizations, like, the, liangzhu, culture, hemudu, culture, and, the, majiabang, culture, it, connects, speakers, of, the, austronesian, languages, in, a, common, linguistic, and, genetic, lineage, including, the, taiwanese, indigenous, peoples, islander, southeast, asians, chams, islander, melanesians, micronesians, polynesians, and, the, malagasy, people, aside, from, language, and, genetics, they, also, share, common, cultural, markers, like, multihull, and, outrigger, boats, tattooing, rice, cultivation, wetland, agriculture, teeth, blackening, jade, carving, betel, nut, chewing, ancestor, worship, and, the, same, domesticated, plants, and, animals, including, dogs, pigs, chickens, yams, bananas, sugarcane, and, coconuts, a, 2021, genetic, study, examining, representatives, of, 115, indigenous, communities, found, evidence, of, at, least, five, independent, waves, of, early, human, migration, negrito, groups, divided, between, those, in, luzon, and, those, in, mindanao, may, come, from, a, single, wave, and, diverged, subsequently, or, through, two, separate, waves, this, likely, occurred, sometime, after, 46, 000, years, ago, another, negrito, migration, entered, mindanao, sometime, after, 25, 000, years, ago, two, early, east, asian, waves, were, detected, one, most, strongly, evidenced, among, the, manobo, people, who, live, in, inland, mindanao, and, the, other, in, the, sama, bajau, and, related, people, of, the, sulu, archipelago, zamboanga, peninsula, and, palawan, the, admixture, found, in, the, sama, people, indicates, a, relationship, with, the, htin, and, mlabri, people, of, mainland, southeast, asia, both, peoples, being, speakers, of, an, austroasiatic, language, and, reflects, a, similar, genetic, signal, found, in, western, indonesia, these, happened, sometime, after, 15, 000, years, ago, and, 12, 000, years, ago, respectively, around, the, time, the, last, glacial, period, was, coming, to, an, end, austronesians, either, from, southern, china, or, taiwan, were, found, to, have, come, in, at, least, two, distinct, waves, the, first, occurring, perhaps, between, 10, 000, and, 7, 000, years, ago, brought, the, ancestors, of, indigenous, groups, that, today, live, around, the, cordillera, central, mountain, range, later, migrations, brought, other, austronesian, groups, along, with, agriculture, and, the, languages, of, these, recent, austronesian, migrants, effectively, replaced, those, existing, populations, in, all, cases, new, immigrants, appear, to, have, mixed, to, some, degree, with, existing, populations, the, integration, of, southeast, asia, into, indian, ocean, trading, networks, around, 2, 000, years, ago, also, shows, some, impact, with, south, asian, genetic, signals, present, within, some, sama, bajau, communities, there, is, also, some, papuan, migration, to, southeast, mindanao, as, papuan, genetic, signatures, were, detected, in, the, sangil, and, blaan, ethnic, groups, by, 1000, bce, the, inhabitants, of, the, philippine, archipelago, had, developed, into, four, distinct, kinds, of, peoples, tribal, groups, such, as, the, aetas, hanunoo, ilongots, and, the, mangyan, who, depended, on, hunter, gathering, and, were, concentrated, in, forests, warrior, societies, such, as, the, isneg, and, kalinga, who, practiced, social, ranking, and, ritualized, warfare, and, roamed, the, plains, the, petty, plutocracy, of, the, ifugao, cordillera, highlanders, who, occupied, the, mountain, ranges, of, luzon, and, the, harbor, principalities, of, the, estuarine, civilizations, that, grew, along, rivers, and, seashores, while, participating, in, trans, island, maritime, trade, it, was, also, during, the, first, millennium, bce, that, early, metallurgy, was, said, to, have, reached, the, archipelagos, of, maritime, southeast, asia, via, trade, with, india, around, 300, 700, ce, the, seafaring, peoples, of, the, islands, traveling, in, balangays, began, to, trade, with, the, indianized, kingdoms, in, the, malay, archipelago, and, the, nearby, east, asian, principalities, adopting, influences, from, both, buddhism, and, hinduism, the, maritime, jade, road, was, initially, established, by, the, animist, indigenous, peoples, between, the, philippines, and, taiwan, and, later, expanded, to, cover, vietnam, malaysia, indonesia, thailand, and, other, countries, artifacts, made, from, white, and, green, nephrite, have, been, discovered, at, a, number, of, archeological, excavations, in, the, philippines, since, the, 1930s, the, artifacts, have, been, both, tools, like, adzes, and, chisels, and, ornaments, such, as, lingling, o, earrings, bracelets, and, beads, tens, of, thousands, were, found, in, a, single, site, in, batangas, the, jade, is, said, to, have, originated, nearby, in, taiwan, and, is, also, found, in, many, other, areas, in, insular, and, mainland, southeast, asia, these, artifacts, are, said, to, be, evidence, of, long, range, communication, between, prehistoric, southeast, asian, societies, throughout, history, the, maritime, jade, road, has, been, known, as, one, of, the, most, extensive, sea, based, trade, networks, of, a, single, geological, material, in, the, prehistoric, world, existing, for, 3, 000, years, from, 2000, bce, to, 1000, ce, the, operations, of, the, maritime, jade, road, coincided, with, an, era, of, near, absolute, peace, which, lasted, for, 1, 500, years, from, 500, bce, to, 1000, ce, during, this, peaceful, pre, colonial, period, not, a, single, burial, site, studied, by, scholars, yielded, any, osteological, proof, for, violent, death, no, instances, of, mass, burials, were, recorded, as, well, signifying, the, peaceful, situation, of, the, islands, burials, with, violent, proof, were, only, found, from, burials, beginning, in, the, 15th, century, likely, due, to, the, newer, cultures, of, expansionism, imported, from, india, and, china, when, the, spanish, arrived, in, the, 16th, century, they, recorded, some, warlike, groups, whose, cultures, have, already, been, influenced, by, the, imported, indian, and, chinese, expansionist, cultures, of, the, 15th, century, the, sa, hu, nh, culture, centered, on, present, day, vietnam, showed, evidence, of, an, extensive, trade, network, sa, hu, nh, beads, were, made, from, glass, carnelian, agate, olivine, zircon, gold, and, garnet, most, of, these, materials, were, not, local, to, the, region, and, were, most, likely, imported, han, dynasty, style, bronze, mirrors, were, also, found, in, sa, hu, nh, sites, conversely, sa, hu, nh, produced, ear, ornaments, have, been, found, in, archaeological, sites, in, central, thailand, taiwan, orchid, island, and, in, the, philippines, in, the, palawan, tabon, caves, one, of, the, great, examples, is, the, kalanay, cave, in, masbate, the, artefacts, on, the, site, in, one, of, the, sa, hu, nh, kalanay, pottery, complex, sites, were, dated, 400bce, 1500, ce, the, maitum, anthropomorphic, pottery, in, the, sarangani, province, of, southern, mindanao, is, c, 200, ce, ambiguity, of, what, is, sa, hu, nh, culture, puts, into, question, its, extent, of, influence, in, southeast, asia, sa, hu, nh, culture, is, characterized, by, use, of, cylindrical, or, egg, shaped, burial, jars, associated, with, hat, shaped, lids, using, its, mortuary, practice, as, a, new, definition, sa, hu, nh, culture, should, be, geographically, restricted, across, central, vietnam, between, hue, city, in, the, north, and, nha, trang, city, in, the, south, recent, archeological, research, reveals, that, the, potteries, in, kalanay, cave, are, quite, different, from, those, of, the, sa, hu, nh, but, strikingly, similar, to, those, in, hoa, diem, site, central, vietnam, and, samui, island, thailand, new, estimate, dates, the, artifacts, in, kalanay, cave, to, come, much, later, than, sa, hu, nh, culture, at, 200, 300, ce, bio, anthropological, analysis, of, human, fossils, found, also, confirmed, the, colonization, of, vietnam, by, austronesian, people, from, insular, southeast, asia, in, e, g, the, hoa, diem, site, also, known, to, a, lesser, extent, as, the, pre, philippines, period, is, a, pre, unification, period, characterized, by, many, independent, states, known, as, polities, each, with, its, own, history, cultures, chieftains, and, governments, distinct, from, each, other, according, to, sources, from, southern, liang, people, from, the, kingdom, of, langkasuka, in, present, day, thailand, were, wearing, cotton, clothes, made, in, luzon, philippines, as, early, as, 516, 520, ce, the, british, historian, robert, nicholl, citing, arab, chronicler, al, ya, akubi, had, written, that, on, the, early, years, of, the, 800s, the, kingdoms, of, muja, then, pagan, brunei, and, mayd, kedatuan, of, madja, as, or, ma, i, waged, war, against, the, chinese, empire, medieval, indian, scholars, also, referred, to, the, philippines, as, panyupayana, the, lands, surrounded, by, water, by, the, 1300s, a, number, of, the, large, coastal, settlements, had, emerged, as, trading, centers, and, became, the, focal, point, of, societal, changes, the, barangic, phase, of, history, can, be, noted, for, its, highly, mobile, nature, with, barangays, transforming, from, being, settlements, and, turning, into, fleets, and, vice, versa, with, the, wood, constantly, re, purposed, according, to, the, situation, politics, during, this, era, was, personality, driven, and, organization, was, based, on, shifting, alliances, and, contested, loyalties, set, in, a, backdrop, of, constant, inter, polity, interactions, both, through, war, and, peace, legendary, accounts, often, mention, the, interaction, of, early, philippine, polities, with, the, srivijaya, empire, but, there, is, not, much, archaeological, evidence, to, definitively, support, such, a, relationship, considerable, evidence, exists, on, the, other, hand, for, extensive, trade, with, the, majapahit, empire, the, exact, scope, and, mechanisms, of, indian, cultural, influences, on, early, philippine, polities, are, still, the, subject, of, some, debate, among, southeast, asian, historiographers, but, the, current, scholarly, consensus, is, that, there, was, probably, little, or, no, direct, trade, between, india, and, the, philippines, and, indian, cultural, traits, such, as, linguistic, terms, and, religious, practices, filtered, in, during, the, 10th, through, the, early, 14th, centuries, through, early, philippine, polities, relations, with, the, hindu, majapahit, empire, the, philippine, archipelago, is, thus, one, of, the, countries, others, include, afghanistan, and, southern, vietnam, just, at, the, outer, edge, of, what, is, considered, the, greater, indian, cultural, zone, the, early, polities, of, the, philippine, archipelago, were, typically, characterized, by, a, three, tier, social, structure, although, different, cultures, had, different, terms, to, describe, them, this, three, tier, structure, invariably, consisted, of, an, apex, nobility, class, a, class, of, freemen, and, a, class, of, dependent, debtor, bondsmen, called, alipin, or, oripun, among, the, members, of, the, nobility, class, were, leaders, who, held, the, political, office, of, datu, which, was, responsible, for, leading, autonomous, social, groups, called, barangay, or, dulohan, whenever, these, barangays, banded, together, either, to, form, a, larger, settlement, or, a, geographically, looser, alliance, group, the, more, senior, or, respected, among, them, would, be, recognized, as, a, paramount, datu, variedly, called, a, lakan, sultan, rajah, or, simply, a, more, senior, datu, eventually, by, the, 14th, to, 16th, century, inter, kingdom, warfare, escalated, and, population, densities, across, the, archipelago, was, low, during, the, period, of, the, south, indian, pallava, dynasty, and, the, north, indian, gupta, empire, indian, culture, spread, to, southeast, asia, and, the, philippines, that, led, to, the, establishment, of, indianized, kingdoms, the, date, inscribed, in, the, oldest, philippine, document, found, so, far, the, laguna, copperplate, inscription, is, 900, ce, from, the, details, of, the, document, written, in, kawi, script, the, bearer, of, a, debt, namwaran, along, with, his, children, lady, angkatan, and, bukah, are, cleared, of, a, debt, by, the, ruler, of, tondo, it, is, the, earliest, document, that, shows, the, use, of, mathematics, in, precolonial, philippine, societies, a, standard, system, of, weights, and, measures, is, demonstrated, by, the, use, of, precise, measurement, for, gold, and, familiarity, with, rudimentary, astronomy, is, shown, by, fixing, the, precise, day, within, the, month, in, relation, to, the, phases, of, the, moon, from, the, various, sanskrit, terms, and, titles, seen, in, the, document, the, culture, and, society, of, manila, bay, was, that, of, a, hindu, old, malay, amalgamation, similar, to, the, cultures, of, java, peninsular, malaysia, and, sumatra, at, the, time, there, are, no, other, significant, documents, from, this, period, of, precolonial, philippine, society, and, culture, until, the, doctrina, christiana, of, the, late, 16th, century, written, at, the, start, of, the, spanish, period, in, both, native, baybayin, script, and, spanish, other, artifacts, with, kawi, script, and, baybayin, were, found, such, as, an, ivory, seal, from, butuan, dated, to, the, early, 10th, 14th, centuries, and, the, calatagan, pot, with, baybayin, inscription, dated, to, not, later, than, early, 16th, century, in, the, years, leading, up, to, 1000, there, were, already, several, maritime, societies, existing, in, the, islands, but, there, was, no, unifying, political, state, encompassing, the, entire, philippine, archipelago, instead, the, region, was, dotted, by, numerous, semi, autonomous, barangays, settlements, ranging, in, size, from, villages, to, city, states, under, the, sovereignty, of, competing, thalassocracies, ruled, by, datus, wangs, rajahs, sultans, or, lakans, or, by, upland, agricultural, societies, ruled, by, petty, plutocrats, a, number, of, states, existed, alongside, the, highland, societies, of, the, ifugao, and, mangyan, these, included, some, of, these, regions, were, part, of, the, malayan, empires, of, srivijaya, majapahit, and, brunei, tondo, was, a, major, trade, hub, on, luzon, island, in, the, northern, part, of, the, pasig, river, delta, the, earliest, historical, record, of, local, polities, and, kingdoms, the, laguna, copperplate, inscription, indirectly, refers, to, the, tagalog, polity, of, tondo, c, before, 900, 1589, and, two, to, three, other, settlements, believed, to, be, located, somewhere, near, tondo, as, well, as, a, settlement, near, mt, diwata, in, mindanao, and, the, temple, complex, of, medang, in, java, although, the, precise, political, relationships, between, these, polities, is, unclear, in, the, text, of, the, inscription, the, artifact, is, usually, accepted, as, evidence, of, intra, and, inter, regional, political, linkages, as, early, as, 900, ce, by, the, arrival, of, the, earliest, european, ethnographers, during, the, 1500s, tondo, was, led, by, the, paramount, ruler, called, a, lakan, it, had, grown, into, a, major, trading, hub, sharing, a, monopoly, with, the, rajahnate, of, maynila, over, the, trade, of, ming, dynasty, products, throughout, the, archipelago, this, trade, was, significant, enough, that, the, yongle, emperor, appointed, a, chinese, governor, named, ko, ch, a, lao, to, oversee, it, since, at, least, the, year, 900, this, thalassocracy, centered, in, manila, bay, flourished, via, an, active, trade, with, chinese, japanese, malays, and, various, other, peoples, in, asia, tondo, thrived, as, the, capital, and, the, seat, of, power, of, this, ancient, kingdom, which, was, led, by, kings, under, the, title, lakan, that, belongs, to, the, caste, of, the, maharlika, who, were, the, feudal, warrior, class, in, ancient, tagalog, society, at, its, height, they, ruled, a, large, part, of, what, is, now, known, as, luzon, from, ilocos, to, bicol, from, possibly, before, 900, ce, to, 1571, becoming, the, largest, precolonial, state, the, spaniards, called, them, hidalgos, the, people, of, tondo, had, developed, a, culture, that, is, predominantly, hindu, and, buddhist, they, were, also, good, agriculturists, and, lived, through, farming, and, aquaculture, during, its, existence, it, grew, to, become, one, of, the, most, prominent, and, wealthy, kingdom, states, in, precolonial, philippines, due, to, heavy, trade, and, connections, with, several, neighboring, nations, such, as, china, and, japan, due, to, its, very, good, relations, with, japan, the, japanese, called, tondo, as, luzon, even, a, famous, japanese, merchant, luzon, sukezaemon, went, as, far, as, to, change, his, surname, from, naya, to, luzon, japan, s, interaction, with, philippine, states, have, precedence, in, the, 700s, when, austronesian, peoples, like, the, hayato, and, kumaso, settled, in, japan, and, culturally, mediated, with, the, locals, and, their, austronesian, kin, to, the, south, served, at, the, imperial, court, and, sometimes, waged, battles, in, japan, japan, also, imported, mishima, ware, manufactured, in, luzon, in, 900, ce, the, lord, minister, jayadewa, presented, a, document, of, debt, forgiveness, to, lady, angkatan, and, her, brother, bukah, the, children, of, namwaran, this, is, described, in, the, philippines, oldest, known, document, the, laguna, copperplate, inscription, the, chinese, also, mention, a, polity, called, luzon, this, is, believed, to, be, a, reference, to, maynila, since, portuguese, and, spanish, accounts, from, the, 1520s, explicitly, state, that, lu, on, and, maynila, were, one, and, the, same, although, some, historians, argue, that, since, none, of, these, observers, actually, visited, maynila, lu, on, may, simply, have, referred, to, all, the, tagalog, and, kapampangan, polities, that, rose, up, on, the, shores, of, manila, bay, cainta, was, a, fortified, upriver, polity, in, present, day, rizal, province, that, occupied, both, shores, of, an, arm, of, the, pasig, river, the, river, bisected, it, in, the, middle, a, moat, surrounded, its,

apparently, among, the, natives, of, the, philippines, who, fought, the, muslims, in, 1538, the, luzones, were, also, pioneer, seafarers, and, it, is, recorded, that, the, portuguese, were, not, only, witnesses, but, also, direct, beneficiaries, of, lusung, s, involvement, many, luzones, chose, malacca, as, their, base, of, operations, because, of, its, strategic, importance, when, the, portuguese,

of, guangdong, and, fujian, and, for, shipping, with, indochina, and, the, ry, ky, islands, these, were, the, halcyon, days, of, the, philippine, branch, of, the, bahan, trade, thus, the, spanish, sought, to, fight, off, these, japanese, pirates, prominent, among, whom, was, warlord, tayfusa, whom, the, spaniards, expelled, after, he, set, up, the, beginnings, of, a, city, state, of, japanese, pirates, in, northern, luzon, the, spanish, repelled, them, in, the, fabled, 1582, cagayan, battles, due, to, the, 1549, ming, ban, on, trade, leveled, against, the, ashikaga, shogunate, as, a,

of, brunei, not, until, the, 19th, century, did, spain, succeed, in, defeating, the, sulu, sultanate, and, taking, mindanao, under, nominal, suzerainty, the, spanish, considered, their, war, with,

invasion, by, the, siamese, that, had, caused, the, ill, fated, spanish, expedition, to, cambodia, that, although, ended, in, failure, had, set, the, foundations, of, the, future, restoration, of,

and, governed, by, mild, laws, vis, a, vis, those, from, any, other, tropical, country, under, native, or, european, sway, owing, in, some, measure, to, the, frequently, discussed, peculiar, spanish,

they, lived, in, competence, if, not, in, affluence, cultivation, was, extended, and, the, exports, steadily, increased, let, us, be, just, what, british, french, or, dutch, colony, populated, by, natives, can, compare, with, the, philippines, as, they, were, until, 1895, the, first, official, census, in, the, philippines, was, carried, out, in, 1878, the, colony, s, population, as, of, december, 31, 1877, was, recorded, at, 5, 567, 685, persons, this, was, followed, by, the, 1887, census, that, yielded, a, count, of, 6, 984, 727, while, that, of, 1898, yielded, 7, 832, 719,

maritime, world, beyond, the, spanish, realm, stated, therein, that, filipinos, who, were, internationally, called, manilamen, were, active, in, the, navies, and, armies, of, the, world, even, after, the, era, of, the, manila, galleons, such, as, the, case, of, the, argentine, war, of, independence, wherein, an, argentinian, of, french, descent, hypolite, bouchard, laid, siege, to, monterey, california, as, a, privateer, for, the, argentine, army, his, second, ship, the, santa, rosa, which, was, captained, by, the, american, peter, corney, had, a, multi, ethnic, crew, which, included, filipinos, it, has, been, proposed, that, those, filipinos, were, recruited, in, san, blas, an, alternative, port, to, acapulco, mexico, where, several, filipinos, had, settled, during, the, manila, acapulco, galleon, trade, era, argentinian, philippine, relations, can, be, traced, even, earlier, since, the, philippines, already, received, immigrants, from, south, america, like, the, soldier, juan, ferm, n, de, san, mart, n, who, was, the, brother, of, the, leader, of, the, argentinian, revolution, jose, de, san, martin, likewise, in, mexico, about, 200, filipinos, were, recruited, by, miguel, hidalgo, in, his, revolution, against, spain, the, most, prominent, of, which, was, the, manila, born, ramon, fabi, afterwards, when, the, revolution, was, continued, by, president, guerrero, general, isidoro, montes, de, oca, another, filipino, mexican, had, participated, in, the, mexican, revolutionary, war, against, spain, too, the, recent, participation, of, overseas, filipinos, in, anti, imperial, wars, in, the, americas, started, even, earlier, when, filipinos, in, the, settlement, of, saint, malo, louisiana, assisted, the, united, states, in, the, defense, of, new, orleans, during, the, war, of, 1812, upon, mexican, independence, the, filipinos, had, such, an, effect, on, mexico, that, there, were, plans, among, the, newly, independent, mexicans, to, help, the, filipinos, revolt, against, spain, too, there, was, even, a, secret, memorandum, from, the, mexican, government, which, read, now, that, we, mexicans, have, fortunately, obtained, our, independence, by, revolution, against, spanish, rule, it, is, our, solemn, duty, to, help, the, less, fortunate, countries, especially, the, philippines, with, whom, our, country, has, had, the, most, intimate, relations, during, the, last, two, centuries, and, a, half, we, should, send, secret, agents, with, a, message, to, their, inhabitants, to, rise, in, revolution, against, spain, and, that, we, shall, give, them, financial, and, military, assistance, to, win, their, freedom, should, the, philippines, succeed, in, gaining, her, independence, from, spain, we, must, felicitate, her, warmly, and, from, an, alliance, of, amity, and, commerce, with, her, as, a, sister, nation, moreover, we, must, resume, the, intimate, mexico, philippine, relations, as, they, were, during, the, halcyon, days, of, the, acapulco, manila, galleon, trade, likewise, in, this, period, overseas, filipinos, were, also, active, in, the, asia, pacific, especially, in, china, and, indochina, during, the, taiping, rebellion, frederick, townsend, ward, had, a, militia, employing, foreigners, to, quell, the, rebellion, for, the, qing, government, at, first, he, hired, american, and, european, adventurers, but, they, proved, unruly, while, recruiting, for, better, troops, he, met, his, aide, de, camp, vincente, vicente, macanaya, who, was, twenty, three, years, old, in, 1860, and, was, part, of, the, large, filipino, population, then, living, in, shanghai, who, were, handy, on, board, ships, and, more, than, a, little, troublesome, on, land, as, caleb, carr, journalistically, put, it, smith, another, writer, about, china, also, notes, in, his, book, mercenaries, and, mandarins, that, manilamen, were, reputed, to, be, brave, and, fierce, fighters, and, were, plentiful, in, shanghai, and, always, eager, for, action, during, this, taiping, rebellion, by, july, 1860, townsend, ward, s, force, of, manilamen, ranging, from, one, to, two, hundred, mercenaries, successfully, assaulted, sung, chiang, prefecture, thus, while, the, philippines, was, slowly, engendered, with, revolutionary, fervour, being, suppressed, by, spain, overseas, filipinos, have, had, an, active, role, in, the, military, and, naval, engagements, of, various, nations, in, the, americas, and, asia, pacific, soldiers, from, the, philippines, were, recruited, by, france, which, was, allied, to, spain, to, initially, protect, indo, chinese, converts, to, roman, catholicism, who, were, persecuted, by, their, native, governments, and, later, for, an, actual, conquest, of, vietnam, and, laos, as, well, as, the, establishment, of, the, protectorate, of, cambodia, which, was, liberated, from, thai, invasions, and, re, established, as, a, vassal, state, of, france, with, the, combined, franco, spanish, filipino, forces, creating, french, cochinchina, which, was, governed, from, the, former, cambodian, and, now, vietnamese, city, of, saigon, the, criollo, and, latino, dissatisfaction, against, the, peninsulares, spaniards, direct, from, spain, spurred, by, their, love, of, the, land, and, their, suffering, people, had, a, justified, hatred, against, the, exploitative, peninsulares, who, were, only, appointed, to, high, positions, due, to, their, race, and, unflinching, loyalty, to, the, homeland, this, resulted, in, the, uprising, of, andres, novales, a, philippine, born, soldier, who,
