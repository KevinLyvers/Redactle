uyghurs, established, a, trading, relationship, with, the, sogdian, merchants, who, controlled, some, oases, of, central, asia, as, described, above, the, uyghur, adoption, of, manichaeism, was, one, aspect, of, this, relationship, choosing, manichaeism, over, buddhism, may, have, been, motivated, by, a, desire, to, show, independence, from, tang, influence, not, all, uyghurs, supported, conversion, an, inscription, at, ordu, baliq, states, that, manichaens, tried, to, divert, people, from, their, ancient, shamanistic, beliefs, a, rather, partisan, account, from, a, uyghur, manichean,
