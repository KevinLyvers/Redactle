volga, bulgaria, or, volga, kama, bulgaria, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, volga, bulgar, emirate, was, a, historical, bulgar, state, that, existed, between, the, 9th, and, 13th, centuries, around, the, confluence, of, the, volga, and, kama, river, in, what, is, now, european, russia, volga, bulgaria, was, a, multi, ethnic, state, with, large, numbers, of, bulgars, finno, ugrians, varangians, and, east, slavs, its, strategic, position, allowed, it, to, create, a, local, trade, monopoly, with, norse, cumans, and, pannonian, avars, the, origin, of, the, early, bulgars, is, still, unclear, their, homeland, is, believed, to, be, situated, between, kazakhstan, and, the, north, caucasian, steppes, interaction, with, the, hunnic, tribes, causing, the, migration, may, have, occurred, there, and, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, seems, the, most, likely, location, some, scholars, propose, that, the, bulgars, may, have, been, a, branch, or, offshoot, of, the, huns, or, at, least, huns, seem, to, have, been, absorbed, by, the, bulgars, after, dengizich, s, death, others, however, argue, that, the, huns, continued, under, ernak, becoming, the, kutrigur, and, utigur, hunno, bulgars, these, conclusions, remain, a, topic, of, ongoing, debate, and, controversy, among, scholars, the, bulgars, were, an, oghuric, people, who, settled, north, of, the, black, sea, during, their, westward, migration, across, the, eurasian, steppe, they, came, under, the, overlordship, of, khazars, leading, other, ethnic, groups, including, finno, ugric, and, iranic, as, well, as, other, turkic, peoples, in, about, 630, they, founded, old, great, bulgaria, which, was, destroyed, by, the, khazars, in, 668, kotrag, following, the, death, of, his, father, began, to, extend, the, influence, of, his, bulgars, to, the, volga, river, he, is, remembered, as, the, founder, of, volga, bulgaria, they, reached, idel, ural, in, the, eighth, century, where, they, became, the, dominant, population, at, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, uniting, other, tribes, of, different, origin, who, lived, in, the, area, however, some, bulgar, tribes, under, the, leader, asparukh, moved, west, from, the, pontic, caspian, steppes, and, eventually, settled, along, the, danube, river, in, what, is, now, known, as, bulgaria, proper, where, they, created, a, confederation, with, the, slavs, adopting, a, south, slavic, language, and, the, eastern, orthodox, faith, however, bulgars, in, idel, ural, eventually, gave, birth, to, chuvash, people, unlike, danube, bulgars, volga, bulgars, did, not, adopt, any, language, the, chuvash, language, today, is, the, only, oghuric, language, that, survived, and, it, is, the, sole, living, representative, of, the, volga, bulgar, language, most, scholars, agree, that, the, volga, bulgars, were, initially, subject, to, the, khazar, khaganate, this, fragmented, volga, bulgaria, grew, in, size, and, power, and, gradually, freed, itself, from, the, influence, of, the, khazars, sometime, in, the, late, 9th, century, unification, processes, started, and, the, capital, was, established, at, bolghar, also, spelled, bulgar, city, 160, km, south, of, modern, kazan, however, complete, independence, was, reached, after, khazaria, s, destruction, and, conquest, by, sviatoslav, in, the, late, 10th, century, thus, bulgars, no, longer, paid, tribute, to, it, abu, al, ghazi, bahadur, named, the, volga, bulgar, people, as, ulak, volga, bulgaria, adopted, islam, as, a, state, religion, in, 922, 66, years, before, the, christianization, of, kievan, rus, in, 921, alm,

lived, in, the, country, the, volga, bulgars, attempted, to, convert, vladimir, i, of, kiev, to, islam, however, vladimir, rejected, the, notion, of, rus, giving, up, wine, which, he, declared, was, the, very, joy, of, their, lives, commanding, the, volga, river, in, its, middle, course, the, state, controlled, much, of, trade, between, europe, and, asia, prior, to, the, crusades, which, made,

not, been, found, but, they, are, mentioned, in, old, east, slavic, sources, they, are, ashli, oshel, tux, in, tukhchin, brahim, bryakhimov, taw, le, some, of, them, were, ruined, during, and, after, the, golden, horde, invasion, volga, bulgaria, played, a, key, role, in, the, trade, between, europe, and, the, muslim, world, furs, and, slaves, were, the, main, goods, in, this, trade, and, the,

passed, via, the, khazar, kaghanate, but, from, the, early, 10th, century, onward, it, went, via, volga, bulgaria, and, from, there, by, caravan, to, khwarazm, to, the, samanid, slave, market, in,

his, importance, for, this, trade, the, rus, principalities, to, the, west, posed, the, only, tangible, military, threat, in, the, 11th, century, the, country, was, devastated, by, several, raids, by,

systematically, pillaged, volga, bulgarian, cities, under, rus, pressure, from, the, west, the, volga, bulgars, had, to, move, their, capital, from, bolghar, to, bil, r, from, the, beginning, of, the,

this, yuri, ii, began, amassing, a, large, force, of, rus, for, an, even, larger, campaign, against, the, bulgars, the, bulgars, would, send, entreaties, and, proposals, for, peace, but, these, were, all, rejected, yuri, travelled, with, his, army, to, omut, where, further, entreaties, for, peace, were, received, from, the, bulgars, however, these, were, still, rejected, however, by, the, time, vasilko, konstantinovich, of, rostov, arrived, yuri, accepted, an, offer, of, gifts, and, agreed, to, adhere, to, an, earlier, peace, treaty, with, the, bulgars, that, was, agreed, under, the, rule,

language, was, a, turkic, language, the, only, extant, member, of, the, oghuric, group, that, is, still, spoken, today, is, the, chuvash, language, the, language, persisted, in, the, volga, region, up, until, the, 13th, or, 14th, century, although, there, is, no, direct, evidence, some, scholars, believe, it, gave, rise, to, modern, chuvash, language, while, others, support, the, idea, that, chuvash, is, another, distinct, oghur, turkic, language, italian, historian, and, philologist, igor, de, rachewiltz, noted, a, significant, distinction, of, the, chuvash, language, from, other, turkic, languages, according, to, him, the, chuvash, language, does, not, share, certain, common, characteristics, with, turkic, languages, to, such, a, degree, that, some, scholars, consider, chuvash, as, an, independent, branch, from, turkic, and, mongolic, the, turkic, classification, of, chuvash, was, seen, as, a, compromise, solution, for, classification, purposes, definition, of, verbs, in, volga, bulgar, volga, bulgars, left, some, inscriptions, in, tombstones, there, are, few, surviving, inscriptions, in, the, volga, bulgar, language, as, the, language, was, primarily, an,

bulghars, some, scholars, suggest, hunnic, had, strong, ties, with, bulgar, and, to, modern, chuvash, and, classify, this, grouping, as, separate, hunno, bulgar, languages, however, such, speculations, are, not, based, on, proper, linguistic, evidence, since, the, language, of, the, huns, is, almost, unknown, except, for, a, few, attested, words, and, personal, names, scholars, generally, consider, hunnish, as, unclassifiable, numbers, and, vocabulary, in, volga, bulgar, mahmud, al, kashgari, also, provides, some, examples, of, volga, bulgar, words, poems, and, phrases, in, his, dictionary, however, mahmud, al, kashgari, himself, wasn, t, a, native, speaker, of, volga, bulgar, despite, its, limitations, mahmud, al, kashgari, s, work, remains, an, important, source, of,
