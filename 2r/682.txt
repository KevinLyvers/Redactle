a, national, flag, is, a, flag, that, represents, and, symbolizes, a, given, nation, it, is, flown, by, the, government, of, that, nation, but, can, also, be, flown, by, its, citizens, a, national, flag, is, typically, designed, with, specific, meanings, for, its, colours, and, symbols, which, may, also, be, used, separately, from, the, flag, as, a, symbol, of, the, nation, the, design, of, a, national, flag, is, sometimes, altered, after, the, occurrence, of, important, historical, events, the, burning, or, destruction, of, a, national, flag, is, a, greatly, symbolic, act, historically, flags, originated, as, military, standards, used, as, field, signs, throughout, history, various, examples, of, such, proto, flags, exist, the, white, cloth, banners, of, the, zhou, dynasty, s, armies, in, the, 11th, century, bc, the, vexillum, standards, flown, by, the, armies, of, the, roman, empire, the, black, standard, famously, carried, by, muhammad, which, later, became, the, flag, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, and, the, various, raven, banners, flown, by, viking, chieftains, angelino, dulcert, published, a, series, of, comprehensive, portolan, charts, in, the, 14th, century, ad, which, famously, showcased, the, flags, of, several, polities, depicted, although, these, are, not, uniformly, national, flags, as, some, were, likely, the, personal, standards, of, the, respective, nation, s, rulers, the, practice, of, flying, flags, indicating, the, country, of, origin, outside, of, the, context, of, warfare, became, common, with, the, maritime, flag, during, the, 13th, century, the, republics, of, genoa, and, venice, both, used, maritime, flags, william, gordon, perrin, wrote, that, the, republic, of, genoa, was, one, of, the, earliest, states, to, adopt, a, national, flag, the, current, design, of, the, flag, of, the, netherlands, originates, as, a, variant, of, the, late, 16th, century, orange, white, blue, prinsenvlag, prince, s, flag, that, was, used, in, the, dutch, war, of, independence, 1568, 1648, evolving, in, the, early, 17th, century, as, the, red, white, blue, statenvlag, states, flag, the, naval, flag, of, the, states, general, of, the, dutch, republic, making, the, dutch, flag, perhaps, the, oldest, tricolour, flag, in, continuous, use, although, standardisation, of, the, exact, colours, is, of, a, much, later, date, during, the, age, of, sail, in, the, early, 17th, century, the, union, jack, finds, its, origins, when, james, vi, of, scotland, inherited, the, english, and, irish, thrones, as, james, i, on, 12, april, 1606, the, new, flag, representing, this, regal, union, between, england, and, scotland, was, specified, in, a, royal, decree, according, to, which, the, flag, of, england, a, red, cross, on, a, white, background, known, as, st, george, s, cross, and, the, flag, of, scotland, a, white, saltire, on, a, blue, background, known, as, the, saltire, or, st, andrew, s, cross, would, be, joined, forming, the, flag, of, great, britain, and, first, union, flag, but, then, without, the, red, cross, of, st, patrick, it, continued, in, use, until, 1, january, 1801, the, effective, date, of, the, legislative, union, of, great, britain, and, ireland, when, the, cross, of, st, patrick, a, red, diagonal, cross, on, white, was, incorporated, into, the, flag, giving, the, union, jack, its, current, design, with, the, emergence, of, nationalist, sentiment, from, the, late, 18th, century, national, flags, began, to, be, displayed, in, civilian, contexts, as, well, notable, early, examples, include, the, us, flag, which, was, first, adopted, as, a, naval, ensign, in, 1777, but, began, to, be, displayed, as, a, generic, symbol, of, the, united, states, after, the, american, revolution, and, the, french, tricolor, which, became, a, symbol, of, the, republic, in, the, 1790s, most, countries, of, europe, standardised, and, codified, the, designs, of, their, maritime, flags, as, national, flags, in, the, course, of, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, specifications, of, the, flag, of, denmark, based, on, a, flag, that, was, in, continuous, use, since, the, 14th, century, were, codified, in, 1748, as, a, rectangular, flag, with, certain, proportions, replacing, the, variant, with, a, split, the, flag, of, switzerland, was, introduced, in, 1889, also, based, on, medieval, war, flags, in, europe, the, red, white, blue, tricolour, design, of, the, flag, of, the, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, became, popular, since, it, was, associated, with, a, republican, form, of, government, through, that, country, s, long, war, of, independence, against, the, spanish, crown, that, association, was, greatly, reinforced, after, the, french, revolution, 1789, when, france, used, the, same, colours, but, with, vertical, instead, of, horizontal, stripes, other, countries, in, europe, like, ireland, italy, romania, and, estonia, and, in, south, and, central, america, selected, tricolours, of, their, own, to, express, their, adherence, to, the, principles, of, liberty, equality, and, fraternity, as, embodied, in, the, french, flag, the, ottoman, flag, now, the, flag, of, turkey, was, adopted, in, 1844, other, non, european, powers, followed, the, trend, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, flag, of, great, qing, being, introduced, in, 1862, that, of, japan, being, introduced, in, 1870, also, in, the, 19th, century, most, countries, of, south, america, introduced, a, flag, as, they, became, independent, peru, in, 1820, bolivia, in, 1851, colombia, in, 1860, brazil, in, 1822, etc, currently, there, are, 193, national, flags, in, the, world, flown, by, sovereign, states, that, are, members, of, the, united, nations, the, national, flag, is, often, mentioned, or, described, in, a, country, s, constitution, but, its, detailed, description, may, be, delegated, to, a, flag, law, passed, by, the, legislature, or, even, secondary, legislation, or, in, monarchies, a, decree, thus, the, national, flag, is, mentioned, briefly, in, the, basic, law, for, the, federal, republic, of, germany, of, 1949, the, federal, flag, is, black, red, gold, art, 22, 2, die, bundesflagge, ist, schwarz, rot, gold, but, its, proportions, were, regulated, in, a, document, passed, by, the, government, in, the, following, year, the, flag, of, the, united, states, is, not, defined, in, the, constitution, but, rather, in, a, separate, flag, resolution, passed, in, 1777, minor, design, changes, of, national, flags, are, often, passed, on, a, legislative, or, executive, level, while, substantial, changes, have, constitutional, character, the, design, of, the, flag, of, serbia, omitting, the, communist, star, of, the, flag, of, yugoslavia, was, a, decision, made, in, the, 1992, serbian, constitutional, referendum, but, the, adoption, of, a, coat, of, arms, within, the, flag, was, based, on, a, government, recommendation, in, 2003, adopted, legislatively, in, 2009, and, again, subject, to, a, minor, design, change, in, 2010, the, flag, of, the, united, states, underwent, numerous, changes, because, the, number, of, stars, represents, the, number, of, states, proactively, defined, in, a, flag, act, of, 1818, to, the, effect, that, on, the, admission, of, every, new, state, into, the, union, one, star, be, added, to, the, union, of, the, flag, it, was, changed, most, recently, in, 1960, with, the, accession, of, hawaii, a, change, in, national, flag, is, often, due, to, a, change, of, regime, especially, following, a, civil, war, or, revolution, in, such, cases, the, military, origins, of, the, national, flag, and, its, connection, to, political, ideology, form, of, government, monarchy, vs, republic, vs, theocracy, etc, remains, visible, in, such, cases, national, flags, acquire, the, status, of, a, political, symbol, the, flag, of, germany, for, instance, was, a, tricolour, of, black, white, red, under, the, german, empire, inherited, from, the, north, german, confederation, 1866, the, weimar, republic, that, followed, adopted, a, black, red, gold, tricolour, nazi, germany, went, back, to, black, white, red, in, 1933, and, black, red, gold, was, reinstituted, by, the, two, successor, states, west, germany, and, east, germany, with, east, germany, s, flag, being, defaced, with, communist, symbols, following, world, war, ii, similarly, the, flag, of, libya, introduced, with, the, creation, of, the, kingdom, of, libya, in, 1951, was, abandoned, in, 1969, with, the, coup, d, tat, led, by, muammar, gaddafi, it, was, used, again, by, national, transitional, council, and, by, anti, gaddafi, forces, during, the, libyan, civil, war, in, 2011, and, officially, adopted, by, the, libyan, interim, constitutional, declaration, there, are, three, distinct, types, of, national, flag, for, use, on, land, and, three, for, use, at, sea, though, many, countries, use, identical, designs, for, several, and, sometimes, all, of, these, types, of, flag, on, land, there, is, a, distinction, between, civil, flags, fiav, symbol, state, flags, and, war, or, military, flags, civil, flags, may, be, flown, by, anyone, regardless, of, whether, they, are, linked, to, government, whereas, state, flags, are, those, used, officially, by, government, agencies, war, flags, also, called, military, flags, are, used, by, military, organizations, such, as, armies, marine, corps, or, air, forces, in, practice, many, countries, such, as, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, have, identical, flags, for, these, three, purposes, national, flag, is, sometimes, used, as, a, vexillological, term, to, refer, to, such, a, three, purpose, flag, in, a, number, of, countries, however, and, notably, those, in, latin, america, there, is, a, distinct, difference, between, civil, and, state, flags, in, most, cases, the, civil, flag, is, a, simplified, version, of, the, state, flag, with, the, difference, often, being, the, presence, of, a, coat, of, arms, on, the, state, flag, that, is, absent, from, the, civil, flag, very, few, countries, use, a, war, flag, that, differs, from, the, state, flag, taiwan, japan, and, china, are, notable, examples, of, this, swallow, tailed, flags, are, used, as, war, flags, and, naval, ensigns, in, nordic, countries, and, charged, versions, as, presidential, or, royal, standards, the, philippines, does, not, have, a, distinctive, war, flag, in, this, usual, sense, but, the, flag, of, the, philippines, is, legally, unique, in, that, it, is, flown, with, the, red, stripe, on, top, when, the, country, is, in, a, state, of, war, rather, than, the, conventional, blue, the, flag, that, indicates, nationality, on, a, ship, is, called, an, ensign, as, with, the, national, flags, there, are, three, varieties, the, civil, ensign, flown, by, private, vessels, state, ensigns, also, called, government, ensigns, flown, by, government, ships, and, war, ensigns, also, called, naval, ensigns, flown, by, naval, vessels, the, ensign, is, flown, from, an, ensign, staff, at, the, stern, of, the, ship, or, from, a, gaff, when, underway, both, these, positions, are, superior, to, any, other, on, the, ship, even, though, the, masthead, is, higher, in, the, absence, of, a, gaff, the, ensign, may, be, flown, from, the, yardarm, see, maritime, flags, national, flags, may, also, be, flown, by, aircraft, and, the, land, vehicles, of, important, officials, in, the, case, of, aircraft, those, flags, are, usually, painted, on, and, those, are, usually, to, be, painted, on, in, the, position, as, if, they, were, blowing, in, the, wind, in, some, countries, such, as, the, united, states, and, canada, except, for, the, royal, canadian, navy, s, ensign, the, national, ensign, is, identical, to, the, national, flag, while, in, others, such, as, the, united, kingdom, india, italy, and, japan, there, are, specific, ensigns, for, maritime, use, most, countries, do, not, have, a, separate, state, ensign, although, the, united, kingdom, is, a, rare, exception, in, having, a, red, ensign, for, civil, use, a, white, ensign, as, its, naval, ensign, and, a, blue, ensign, for, government, non, military, vessels, italian, naval, ensign, bears, the, arms, of, the, italian, navy, a, shield, surmounted, by, a, turreted, and, rostrum, crown, which, brings, together, in, four, parts, the, arms, of, four, ancient, maritime, republics, republic, of, venice, republic, of, genoa, republic, of, pisa, and, republic, of, amalfi, there, is, a, great, deal, of, protocol, involved, in, the, proper, display, of, national, flags, a, general, rule, is, that, the, national, flag, should, be, flown, in, the, position, of, honour, and, not, in, an, inferior, position, to, any, other, flag, although, some, countries, make, an, exception, for, royal, standards, the, following, rules, are, typical, of, the, conventions, when, flags, are, flown, on, land, most, flags, are, hung, vertically, by, rotating, the, flag, pole, however, some, countries, have, specific, protocols, for, this, purpose, or, even, have, special, flags, for, vertical, hanging, usually, rotating, some, elements, of, the, flag, such, as, the, coat, of, arms, so, that, they, are, seen, in, an, upright, position, examples, of, countries, that, have, special, protocol, for, vertical, hanging, are, canada, czech, republic, greece, israel, the, philippines, south, africa, and, the, united, states, reverse, always, showing, and, the, united, kingdom, obverse, always, showing, examples, of, countries, that, have, special, designs, for, vertical, hanging, are, austria, cambodia, coat, of, arms, must, be, rotated, 90, and, blue, strips, are, narrowed, dominica, coat, of, arms, must, be, rotated, and, reverse, always, showing, germany, hungary, liechtenstein, crown, must, be, rotated, 90, mexico, montenegro, coat, of, arms, must, be, rotated, 90, to, normal, position, nepal, slovakia, coat, of, arms, must, be, rotated, 90, to, normal, position, and, saudi, arabia, shahada, must, be, rotated, 90, a, vertical, banner, is, used, instead, of, the, horizontal, flag, for, malaysia, the, art, and, practice, of, designing, flags, is, known, as, vexillography, the, design, of, national, flags, has, seen, a, number, of, customs, become, apparent, most, national, flags, are, rectangular, or, have, a, rectangular, common, variant, with, the, most, notable, exception, being, the, flag, of, nepal, the, ratios, of, height, to, width, vary, among, national, flags, but, none, is, taller, than, it, is, wide, again, except, for, the, flag, of, nepal, the, flags, of, switzerland, and, the, vatican, city, are, the, only, national, flags, which, are, exact, squares, the, obverse, and, reverse, of, all, national, flags, are, either, identical, or, mirrored, except, for, the, flag, of, paraguay, and, the, partially, recognized, sahrawi, arab, democratic, republic, see, flags, whose, reverse, differs, from, the, obverse, for, a, list, of, exceptions, including, non, national, flags, as, of, 2011, all, national, flags, consist, of, at, least, two, different, colours, in, many, cases, the, different, colours, are, presented, in, either, horizontal, or, vertical, bands, it, is, particularly, common, for, colours, to, be, presented, in, bands, of, three, it, is, common, for, many, flags, to, feature, national, symbols, such, as, coats, of, arms, national, patterns, are, present, in, some, flags, variations, in, design, within, a, national, flag, can, be, common, in, the, flag, s, upper, left, quarter, or, canton, a, third, of, the, world, s, 196, countries, currently, have, national, flags, that, include, religious, symbols, this, has, led, to, controversy, in, some, secular, states, in, regard, to, the, separation, of, church, and, state, when, the, national, symbol, is, officially, sanctioned, by, a, government, the, most, common, colours, in, national, flags, are, red, white, green, dark, blue, yellow, light, blue, and, black, the, only, national, flag, not, to, include, the, colors, red, white, or, blue, is, jamaica, s, the, occurrence, of, each, colour, in, all, the, flags, is, listed, in, detail, in, the, table, below, the, table, shows, that, the, colours, light, brown, dark, brown, and, grey, are, only, present, in, very, small, quantities, to, be, more, precise, these, colours, are, currently, only, present, in, some, of, the, symbols, found, within, a, few, flags, such, as, in, the, case, of, the, spanish, flag, although, the, national, flag, is, meant, to, be, a, unique, symbol, representing, a, nation, many, countries, have, highly, similar, flags, examples, include, the, flags, of, monaco, and, indonesia, which, differ, only, slightly, in, proportion, and, the, tint, of, red, the, flags, of, the, netherlands, and, luxembourg, which, differ, in, proportion, as, well, as, in, the, tint, of, blue, used, the, flags, of, romania, and, chad, which, differ, only, in, the, tint, of, blue, and, the, flags, of, cuba, and, puerto, rico, which, differ, only, in, proportion, placement, and, tint, of, colors, the, flags, of, ireland, and, ivory, coast, and, the, flags, of, mali, and, guinea, are, aside, from, shade, or, ratio, differences, vertically, mirrored, versions, from, each, other, this, means, that, the, reverse, of, one, flag, matches, the, obverse, of, the, other, unlike, horizontally, mirrored, flags, like, poland, and, indonesia, the, direction, in, which, these, flags, fly, is, crucial, to, identify, them, there, are, three, colour, combinations, that, are, used, on, several, flags, in, certain, regions, blue, white, and, red, is, a, common, combination, in, slavic, countries, such, as, the, czech, republic, slovakia, russia, serbia, slovenia, and, croatia, as, well, as, among, western, nations, including, australia, france, iceland, the, netherlands, new, zealand, norway, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, many, african, nations, use, the, pan, african, colours, of, red, yellow, and, green, including, cameroon, ethiopia, ghana, guinea, mali, and, senegal, flags, containing, red, white, and, black, a, subset, of, the, pan, arab, colours, can, be, found, particularly, among, the, arab, nations, such, as, egypt, iraq, syria, and, yemen, due, to, the, common, arrangement, of, the, same, colours, at, first, sight, it, seems, that, the, only, difference, between, the, italian, and, the, mexican, flag, is, only, the, coat, of, arms, of, mexico, present, in, the, latter, in, reality, the, italian, tricolour, uses, lighter, shades, of, green, and, red, and, has, different, proportions, than, the, mexican, flag, those, of, the, italian, flag, are, equal, to, 2, 3, while, the, proportions, of, the, mexican, flag, are, 4, 7, the, similarity, between, the, two, flags, posed, a, serious, problem, in, maritime, transport, given, that, originally, the, mexican, mercantile, flag, was, devoid, of, arms, and, therefore, was, consequently, identical, to, the, italian, republican, tricolour, of, 1946, to, obviate, the, inconvenience, at, the, request, of, the, international, maritime, organization, both, italy, and, mexico, adopted, naval, flags, with, different, crests, many, other, similarities, may, be, found, among, current, national, flags, particularly, if, inversions, of, colour, schemes, are, considered, e, g, compare, the, flag, of, senegal, to, that, of, cameroon, and, indonesia, to, poland, and, monaco, also, the, flag, of, italy, and, the, flag, of, hungary, use, the, same, colours, although, the, order, and, direction, differ, the, italian, flag, is, vertical, green, white, red, and, the, hungarian, flag, is, horizontal, red, white, green, the, same, goes, for, the, flag, of, france, and, the, flag, of, the, netherlands, the, french, flag, is, vertical, blue, white, red, and, the, dutch, flag, is, horizontal, red, white, blue, while, some, similarities, are, coincidental, others, are, part, of, a, flag, family, flags, rooted, in, shared, histories, for, example, the, flags, of, colombia, of, ecuador, and, of, venezuela, all, use, variants, of, the, flag, of, gran, colombia, the, country, they, composed, upon, their, independence, from, spain, created, by, the, venezuelan, independence, hero, francisco, de, miranda, and, the, flags, of, kuwait, of, jordan, and, of, palestine, are, all, highly, similar, variants, of, the, flag, of, the, arab, revolt, of, 1916, 1918, the, flags, of, romania, and, moldova, are, virtually, the, same, because, of, the, common, history, and, heritage, moldova, adopted, the, romanian, flag, during, the, declaration, of, independence, from, the, ussr, in, 1991, and, was, used, in, various, demonstrations, and, revolts, by, the, population, and, later, the, moldovan, coat, of, arms, which, is, part, of, the, romanian, coat, of, arms, was, placed, in, the, centre, of, the, flag, all, nordic, countries, with, the, exception, of, greenland, use, the, nordic, cross, design, iceland, denmark, norway, sweden, finland, in, addition, to, the, autonomous, regions, of, the, faroe, islands, and, land, a, horizontal, cross, shifted, to, the, left, on, a, single, coloured, background, the, united, states, and, united, kingdom, both, have, red, white, and, blue, this, similarity, is, due, to, the, fact, that, the, first, 13, states, of, the, u, s, were, formerly, colonies, of, the, united, kingdom, some, similarities, to, the, united, states, flag, with, the, red, and, white, stripes, are, noted, as, well, such, as, the, flag, of, malaysia, and, the, flag, of, liberia, the, latter, of, which, was, an, american, resettlement, colony, also, several, former, colonies, of, the, united, kingdom, such, as, australia, fiji, and, new, zealand, include, the, union, jack, in, the, top, left, corner
