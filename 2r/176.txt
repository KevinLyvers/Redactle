mycenaean, greece, or, the, mycenaean, civilization, was, the, last, phase, of, the, bronze, age, in, ancient, greece, spanning, the, period, from, approximately, 1750, to, 1050, bc, it, represents, the, first, advanced, and, distinctively, greek, civilization, in, mainland, greece, with, its, palatial, states, urban, organization, works, of, art, and, writing, system, the, mycenaeans, were, mainland, greek, peoples, who, were, likely, stimulated, by, their, contact, with, insular, minoan, crete, and, other, mediterranean, cultures, to, develop, a, more, sophisticated, sociopolitical, culture, of, their, own, the, most, prominent, site, was, mycenae, after, which, the, culture, of, this, era, is, named, other, centers, of, power, that, emerged, included, pylos, tiryns, and, midea, in, the, peloponnese, orchomenos, thebes, and, athens, in, central, greece, and, iolcos, in, thessaly, mycenaean, settlements, also, appeared, in, epirus, macedonia, on, islands, in, the, aegean, sea, on, the, south, west, coast, of, asia, minor, and, on, cyprus, while, mycenaean, influenced, settlements, appeared, in, the, levant, and, italy, the, mycenaean, greeks, introduced, several, innovations, in, the, fields, of, engineering, architecture, and, military, infrastructure, while, trade, over, vast, areas, of, the, mediterranean, was, essential, for, the, mycenaean, economy, their, syllabic, script, linear, b, offers, the, first, written, records, of, the, greek, language, and, their, religion, already, included, several, deities, that, can, also, be, found, in, the, olympic, pantheon, mycenaean, greece, was, dominated, by, a, warrior, elite, society, and, consisted, of, a, network, of, palace, centered, states, that, developed, rigid, hierarchical, political, social, and, economic, systems, at, the, head, of, this, society, was, the, king, known, as, a, wanax, mycenaean, greece, perished, with, the, collapse, of, bronze, age, culture, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, to, be, followed, by, the, greek, dark, ages, a, recordless, transitional, period, leading, to, archaic, greece, where, significant, shifts, occurred, from, palace, centralized, to, decentralized, forms, of, socio, economic, organization, including, the, extensive, use, of, iron, various, theories, have, been, proposed, for, the, end, of, this, civilization, among, them, the, dorian, invasion, or, activities, connected, to, the, sea, peoples, additional, theories, such, as, natural, disasters, and, climatic, changes, have, also, been, suggested, the, mycenaean, period, became, the, historical, setting, of, much, ancient, greek, literature, and, mythology, including, the, trojan, epic, cycle, the, bronze, age, in, mainland, greece, is, generally, termed, as, the, helladic, period, by, modern, archaeologists, after, hellas, the, greek, name, for, greece, this, period, is, divided, into, three, subperiods, the, early, helladic, eh, period, c, 3200, 2000, bc, was, a, time, of, prosperity, with, the, use, of, metals, and, a, growth, in, technology, economy, and, social, organization, the, middle, helladic, mh, period, c, 2000, 1700, 1675, bc, faced, a, slower, pace, of, development, as, well, as, the, evolution, of, megaron, type, dwellings, and, cist, grave, burials, the, last, phase, of, middle, helladic, the, middle, helladic, iii, c, 1750, 1675, bc, along, with, the, late, helladic, lh, period, c, 1700, 1675, 1050, bc, roughly, coincide, with, mycenaean, greece, the, late, helladic, period, is, further, divided, into, lhi, and, lhii, both, of, which, coincide, with, the, middle, phase, of, mycenaean, greece, c, 1700, 1675, 1420, bc, and, lhiii, c, 1420, 1050, bc, the, period, of, expansion, and, decline, of, the, mycenaean, civilization, the, transition, period, from, the, bronze, age, to, the, iron, age, in, greece, is, known, as, sub, mycenaean, c, 1050, 1000, bc, based, on, recent, research, alex, knodell, 2021, considers, the, beginning, of, mycenaean, occupation, in, peloponnese, in, middle, helladic, iii, c, 1750, 1675, bc, and, divides, the, whole, mycenaean, time, into, three, cultural, periods, early, mycenaean, c, 1750, 1400, bc, palatial, bronze, age, c, 1400, 1200, bc, and, postpalatial, bronze, age, c, 1200, 1050, bc, the, decipherment, of, the, mycenaean, linear, b, script, a, writing, system, adapted, for, the, use, of, the, indo, european, greek, language, of, the, late, bronze, age, demonstrated, the, continuity, of, greek, speech, from, the, second, millennium, bc, into, the, eighth, century, bc, when, a, new, phoenician, derived, alphabetic, script, emerged, moreover, it, revealed, that, the, bearers, of, mycenaean, culture, were, ethnically, connected, with, the, populations, that, resided, in, the, greek, peninsula, after, the, end, of, this, cultural, period, lastly, the, decipherment, marked, the, advent, of, an, indo, european, language, in, the, aegean, region, in, contrast, to, unrelated, prior, languages, spoken, in, adjoining, areas, various, collective, terms, for, the, inhabitants, of, mycenaean, greece, were, used, by, homer, in, his, 8th, century, bc, epic, the, iliad, in, reference, to, the, trojan, war, homer, interchangeably, used, the, ethnonyms, achaeans, danaans, and, argives, to, refer, to, the, besiegers, and, these, names, appear, to, have, passed, down, from, the, time, they, were, in, use, to, the, time, when, homer, applied, them, as, collective, terms, in, his, iliad, there, is, an, isolated, reference, to, a, ka, wi, ja, de, in, the, linear, b, records, in, knossos, crete, dated, to, c, 1400, bc, which, presumably, refers, to, a, mycenaean, achaean, state, on, the, greek, mainland, egyptian, records, mention, a, t, d, n, j, or, danaya, tanaju, land, for, the, first, time, c, 1437, bc, during, the, reign, of, pharaoh, thutmoses, iii, r, 1479, 1425, bc, this, land, is, geographically, defined, in, an, inscription, from, the, reign, of, amenhotep, iii, r, c, 1390, 1352, bc, where, a, number, of, danaya, cities, are, mentioned, which, cover, the, largest, part, of, southern, mainland, greece, among, them, cities, such, as, mycenae, nauplion, and, thebes, have, been, identified, with, certainty, danaya, has, been, equated, with, the, ethnonym, danaoi, greek, the, name, of, the, mythical, dynasty, that, ruled, in, the, region, of, argos, also, used, as, an, ethnonym, for, the, greek, people, by, homer, in, the, official, records, of, another, bronze, age, empire, that, of, the, hittites, in, anatolia, various, references, from, c, 1400, bc, to, 1220, bc, mention, a, country, named, ahhiyawa, recent, scholarship, based, on, textual, evidence, new, interpretations, of, the, hittite, inscriptions, and, recent, surveys, of, archaeological, evidence, about, mycenaean, anatolian, contacts, during, this, period, concludes, that, the, term, ahhiyawa, must, have, been, used, in, reference, to, the, mycenaean, world, land, of, the, achaeans, or, at, least, to, a, part, of, it, this, term, may, have, also, had, broader, connotations, in, some, texts, possibly, referring, to, all, regions, settled, by, mycenaeans, or, regions, under, direct, mycenaean, political, control, another, similar, ethnonym, ekwesh, in, twelfth, century, bc, egyptian, inscriptions, has, been, commonly, identified, with, the, ahhiyawans, these, ekwesh, were, mentioned, as, a, group, of, the, sea, people, scholars, have, proposed, different, theories, on, the, origins, of, the, mycenaeans, according, to, one, theory, mycenaean, civilization, reflected, the, exogenous, imposition, of, archaic, indo, europeans, from, the, eurasian, steppe, onto, the, pre, mycenaean, local, population, an, issue, with, this, theory, however, is, the, very, tenuous, material, and, cultural, relationship, between, aegean, and, northern, steppe, populations, during, the, bronze, age, another, theory, proposes, that, mycenaean, culture, in, greece, dates, back, to, circa, 3000, bc, with, indo, european, migrants, entering, a, mainly, depopulated, area, other, hypotheses, argue, for, a, date, as, early, as, the, seventh, millennium, bc, with, the, spread, of, agriculture, and, as, late, as, 1600, bc, with, the, spread, of, chariot, technology, in, a, 2017, genetic, study, conducted, by, lazaridis, et, al, the, minoans, and, mycenaeans, were, genetically, similar, the, mycenaeans, differed, from, minoans, in, deriving, additional, ancestry, from, an, ultimate, source, related, to, the, hunter, gatherers, of, eastern, europe, and, siberia, introduced, via, a, proximal, source, related, to, the, inhabitants, of, either, the, eurasian, steppe, or, armenia, however, lazaridis, et, al, admit, that, their, research, does, not, settle, th, debate, on, mycenaean, origins, historian, bernard, sergent, notes, that, archaeology, alone, is, not, able, to, solve, the, issue, and, that, the, majority, of, hellenists, believed, mycenaeans, spoke, a, non, indo, european, minoan, language, before, linear, b, was, deciphered, in, 1952, notwithstanding, the, above, academic, disputes, the, mainstream, consensus, among, modern, mycenologists, is, that, mycenaean, civilization, began, around, 1750, bc, earlier, than, the, shaft, graves, originating, and, evolving, from, the, local, socio, cultural, landscape, of, the, early, and, middle, bronze, age, in, mainland, greece, with, influences, from, minoan, crete, towards, the, end, of, the, middle, bronze, age, c, 1700, 1675, bc, a, significant, increase, in, the, population, and, the, number, of, settlements, occurred, a, number, of, centers, of, power, emerged, in, southern, mainland, greece, dominated, by, a, warrior, elite, society, while, the, typical, dwellings, of, that, era, were, an, early, type, of, megaron, buildings, some, more, complex, structures, are, classified, as, forerunners, of, the, later, palaces, in, a, number, of, sites, defensive, walls, were, also, erected, meanwhile, new, types, of, burials, and, more, imposing, ones, have, been, unearthed, which, display, a, great, variety, of, luxurious, objects, among, the, various, burial, types, the, shaft, grave, became, the, most, common, form, of, elite, burial, a, feature, that, gave, the, name, to, the, early, period, of, mycenaean, greece, among, the, mycenaean, elite, deceased, men, were, usually, laid, to, rest, in, gold, masks, and, funerary, armor, and, women, in, gold, crowns, and, clothes, gleaming, with, gold, ornaments, the, royal, shaft, graves, next, to, the, acropolis, of, mycenae, in, particular, the, grave, circles, a, and, b, signified, the, elevation, of, a, native, greek, speaking, royal, dynasty, whose, economic, power, depended, on, long, distance, sea, trade, during, this, period, the, mycenaean, centers, witnessed, increased, contact, with, the, outside, world, especially, with, the, cyclades, and, the, minoan, centers, on, the, island, of, crete, mycenaean, presence, appears, to, be, also, depicted, in, a, fresco, at, akrotiri, on, thera, island, which, possibly, displays, many, warriors, in, boar, s, tusk, helmets, a, feature, typical, of, mycenaean, warfare, in, the, early, 15th, century, bc, commerce, intensified, with, mycenaean, pottery, reaching, the, western, coast, of, asia, minor, including, miletus, and, troy, cyprus, lebanon, palestine, and, egypt, early, mycenaean, civilization, from, the, shaft, grave, period, generally, showcases, heavy, influence, from, minoan, crete, in, regards, to, e, g, art, infrastructure, and, symbols, while, also, maintaining, some, helladic, elements, as, well, as, some, innovations, and, some, west, asian, influences, a, difference, between, mycenaean, and, minoan, civilizations, is, complexity, and, monumentality, mycenaean, craftmanship, and, architecture, are, more, simplified, versions, of, minoan, ones, but, are, more, monumental, in, size, later, phases, of, the, mycenaean, civilization, showcase, more, sophistication, eventually, coming, to, surpass, minoan, crete, after, a, few, centuries, at, the, end, of, the, shaft, grave, era, a, new, and, more, imposing, type, of, elite, burial, emerged, the, tholos, large, circular, burial, chambers, with, high, vaulted, roofs, and, a, straight, entry, passage, lined, with, stone, starting, in, the, 15th, century, bc, the, mycenaeans, began, to, spread, their, influence, throughout, the, aegean, and, western, anatolia, by, c, 1450, bc, the, palace, of, knossos, was, ruled, by, a, mycenaean, elite, who, formed, a, hybrid, minoan, mycenaean, culture, mycenaeans, also, colonized, several, other, aegean, islands, reaching, as, far, as, rhodes, thus, the, mycenaeans, became, the, dominant, power, of, the, region, marking, the, beginning, of, the, mycenaean, koine, era, from, greek, common, a, highly, uniform, culture, that, spread, in, mainland, greece, and, the, aegean, from, the, early, 14th, century, bc, mycenaean, trade, began, to, take, advantage, of, the, new, commercial, opportunities, in, the, mediterranean, after, the, minoan, collapse, the, trade, routes, were, expanded, further, reaching, cyprus, amman, in, the, near, east, apulia, in, italy, and, spain, from, that, time, period, c, 1400, bc, the, palace, of, knossos, has, yielded, the, earliest, records, of, the, greek, linear, b, script, based, on, the, previous, linear, a, of, the, minoans, the, use, of, the, new, script, spread, in, mainland, greece, and, offers, valuable, insight, into, the, administrative, network, of, the, palatial, centers, however, the, unearthed, records, are, too, fragmentary, for, a, political, reconstruction, of, bronze, age, greece, excavations, at, miletus, southwest, asia, minor, indicate, the, existence, of, a, mycenaean, settlement, there, already, from, c, 1450, bc, replacing, the, previous, minoan, installations, this, site, became, a, sizable, and, prosperous, mycenaean, center, until, the, 12th, century, bc, apart, from, the, archaeological, evidence, this, is, also, attested, in, hittite, records, which, indicate, that, miletos, milawata, in, hittite, was, the, most, important, base, for, mycenaean, activity, in, asia, minor, mycenaean, presence, also, reached, the, adjacent, sites, of, iasus, and, ephesus, meanwhile, imposing, palaces, were, built, in, the, main, mycenaean, centers, of, the, mainland, the, earliest, palace, structures, were, megaron, type, buildings, such, as, the, menelaion, in, sparta, lakonia, palaces, proper, are, datable, from, c, 1400, bc, when, cyclopean, fortifications, were, erected, at, mycenae, and, nearby, tiryns, additional, palaces, were, built, in, midea, and, pylos, in, peloponnese, athens, eleusis, thebes, and, orchomenos, in, central, greece, and, iolcos, in, thessaly, the, latter, being, the, northernmost, mycenaean, center, knossos, in, crete, also, became, a, mycenaean, center, where, the, former, minoan, complex, underwent, a, number, of, adjustments, including, the, addition, of, a, throne, room, these, centers, were, based, on, a, rigid, network, of, bureaucracy, where, administrative, competencies, were, classified, into, various, sections, and, offices, according, to, specialization, of, work, and, trades, at, the, head, of, this, society, was, the, king, known, as, wanax, linear, b, wa, na, ka, in, mycenaean, greek, all, powers, were, vested, in, him, as, the, main, landlord, and, spiritual, and, military, leader, at, the, same, time, he, was, an, entrepreneur, and, trader, and, was, aided, by, a, network, of, high, officials, the, presence, of, ahhiyawa, in, western, anatolia, is, mentioned, in, various, hittite, accounts, from, c, 1400, to, c, 1220, bc, ahhiyawa, is, generally, accepted, as, a, hittite, term, for, mycenaean, greece, achaeans, in, homeric, greek, but, a, precise, geographical, definition, of, the, term, cannot, be, drawn, from, the, texts, during, this, time, the, kings, of, ahhiyawa, were, evidently, capable, of, dealing, with, their, hittite, counterparts, both, on, a, diplomatic, and, military, level, moreover, ahhiyawa, achieved, considerable, political, influence, in, parts, of, western, anatolia, typically, by, encouraging, anti, hittite, uprisings, and, collaborating, with, local, vassal, rulers, in, c, 1400, bc, hittite, records, mention, the, military, activities, of, an, ahhiyawan, warlord, attarsiya, possibly, related, to, the, mythic, character, of, atreus, attarsiya, attacked, hittite, vassals, in, western, anatolia, including, madduwatta, later, in, c, 1315, bc, an, anti, hittite, rebellion, headed, by, arzawa, a, hittite, vassal, state, received, support, from, ahhiyawa, meanwhile, ahhiyawa, appears, to, be, in, control, of, a, number, of, islands, in, the, aegean, an, impression, also, supported, by, archaeological, evidence, during, the, reign, of, the, hittite, king, hattusili, iii, c, 1267, 1237, bc, the, king, of, ahhiyawa, is, recognized, as, a, great, king, and, of, equal, status, with, the, other, contemporary, great, bronze, age, rulers, the, kings, of, egypt, babylonia, and, assyria, at, that, time, another, anti, hittite, movement, led, by, piyama, radu, broke, out, and, was, supported, by, the, king, of, ahhiyawa, piyama, radu, caused, major, unrest, which, may, have, extended, to, the, region, of, wilusa, and, later, invaded, the, island, of, lesbos, which, then, passed, into, ahhiyawan, control, scholars, have, speculated, that, the, mythic, tradition, of, the, trojan, war, could, have, a, historical, basis, in, the, political, turmoil, of, this, era, as, a, result, of, this, instability, the, hittite, king, initiated, correspondence, in, order, to, convince, his, ahhiyawan, counterpart, to, restore, peace, in, the, region, the, hittite, record, mentions, a, certain, tawagalawa, a, possible, hittite, rendering, of, the, greek, name, eteocles, as, brother, of, the, king, of, ahhiyawa, in, c, 1250, bc, the, first, wave, of, destruction, apparently, occurred, in, various, centres, of, mainland, greece, for, reasons, that, cannot, be, identified, by, archaeologists, in, boeotia, thebes, was, burned, to, the, ground, around, that, year, or, slightly, later, nearby, orchomenos, was, not, destroyed, at, this, time, but, was, abandoned, while, the, boeotian, fortifications, of, gla, displays, evidence, for, a, targeted, destruction, as, only, the, four, gates, and, the, monumental, building, called, the, melathron, were, burned, before, the, site, was, abandoned, in, the, peloponnese, a, number, of, buildings, surrounding, the, citadel, of, mycenae, were, attacked, and, burned, these, incidents, appear, to, have, prompted, the, massive, strengthening, and, expansion, of, the, fortifications, in, various, sites, in, some, cases, arrangements, were, also, made, for, the, creation, of, subterranean, passages, which, led, to, underground, cisterns, tiryns, midea, and, athens, expanded, their, defences, with, new, cyclopean, style, walls, the, extension, program, in, mycenae, almost, doubled, the, fortified, area, of, the, citadel, to, this, phase, of, extension, belongs, the, impressive, lion, gate, the, main, entrance, into, the, mycenaean, acropolis, it, appears, that, after, this, first, wave, of, destruction, a, short, lived, revival, of, mycenaean, culture, followed, mycenaean, greece, continues, to, be, mentioned, in, international, affairs, particularly, in, hittite, records, in, c, 1220, bc, the, king, of, ahhiyawa, is, again, reported, to, have, been, involved, in, an, anti, hittite, uprising, in, western, anatolia, another, contemporary, hittite, account, reports, that, ahhiyawan, ships, should, avoid, assyrian, controlled, harbors, as, part, of, a, trade, embargo, imposed, on, assyria, in, general, in, the, second, half, of, 13th, century, bc, trade, was, in, decline, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, most, probably, due, to, the, unstable, political, environment, there, none, of, the, defence, measures, appear, to, have, prevented, the, final, destruction, and, collapse, of, the, mycenaean, states, a, second, destruction, struck, mycenae, in, c, 1190, bc, or, shortly, thereafter, this, event, marked, the, end, of, mycenae, as, a, major, power, the, site, was, then, reoccupied, but, on, a, smaller, scale, a, recent, study, suggests, that, neither, of, the, palaces, at, tiryns, or, midea, were, destroyed, by, an, earthquake, and, further, studies, have, shown, that, upwards, of, fifty, arrowheads, were, found, scattered, in, the, destruction, debris, at, midea, perhaps, indicating, that, the, destruction, was, caused, by, an, assault, the, palace, of, pylos, in, the, southwestern, peloponnese, was, destroyed, in, c, 1180, bc, the, linear, b, archives, found, there, preserved, by, the, heat, of, the, fire, that, destroyed, the, palace, mention, hasty, defence, preparations, due, to, an, imminent, attack, without, giving, any, detail, about, the, attacking, force, as, a, result, of, this, turmoil, specific, regions, in, mainland, greece, witnessed, a, dramatic, population, decrease, especially, boeotia, argolis, and, messenia, mycenaean, refugees, migrated, to, cyprus, and, the, levantine, coast, nevertheless, other, regions, on, the, edge, of, the, mycenaean, world, prospered, such, as, the, ionian, islands, the, northwestern, peloponnese, parts, of, attica, and, a, number, of, aegean, islands, the, acropolis, of, athens, oddly, appears, to, have, avoided, destruction, athens, and, the, eastern, coast, of, attica, were, still, occupied, in, the, 12th, century, bc, and, were, not, destroyed, or, abandoned, this, points, to, the, existence, of, new, decentralized, coastal, and, maritime, networks, there, it, is, attested, by, the, cemetery, of, perati, that, lasted, a, century, and, showed, imports, from, cyclades, dodecanese, crete, cyprus, egypt, and, syria, as, well, as, by, the, late, helladic, iiic, c, 1210, 1040, bc, cemetery, of, drivlia, at, porto, rafti, located, 2, km, west, of, perati, this, indicates, that, attica, participated, in, long, distance, trade, and, was, also, incorporated, in, a, mainland, looking, network, the, site, of, mycenae, experienced, a, gradual, loss, of, political, and, economic, status, while, tiryns, also, in, the, argolid, region, expanded, its, settlement, and, became, the, largest, local, center, during, the, post, palatial, period, in, late, helladic, iiic, c, 1200, 1050, bc, the, reasons, for, the, end, of, the, mycenaean, culture, have, been, hotly, debated, among, scholars, at, present, there, is, no, satisfactory, explanation, for, the, collapse, of, the, mycenaean, palace, systems, the, two, most, common, theories, are, population, movement, and, internal, conflict, the, first, attributes, the, destruction, of, mycenaean, sites, to, invaders, the, hypothesis, of, a, dorian, invasion, known, as, such, in, ancient, greek, tradition, that, led, to, the, end, of, mycenaean, greece, is, supported, by, sporadic, archaeological, evidence, such, as, new, types, of, burials, in, particular, cist, graves, and, the, use, of, a, new, dialect, of, greek, the, doric, one, it, appears, that, the, dorians, moved, southward, gradually, over, a, number, of, years, and, devastated, the, territory, until, they, managed, to, establish, themselves, in, the, mycenaean, centers, a, new, type, of, ceramic, also, appeared, called, barbarian, ware, because, it, was, attributed, to, invaders, from, the, north, on, the, other, hand, the, collapse, of, mycenaean, greece, coincides, with, the, activity, of, the, sea, peoples, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, they, caused, widespread, destruction, in, anatolia, and, the, levant, and, were, finally, defeated, by, pharaoh, ramesses, iii, in, c, 1175, bc, one, of, the, ethnic, groups, that, comprised, these, people, were, the, eqwesh, a, name, that, appears, to, be, linked, with, the, ahhiyawa, of, the, hittite, inscriptions, alternative, scenarios, propose, that, the, fall, of, mycenaean, greece, was, a, result, of, internal, disturbances, which, led, to, internecine, warfare, among, the, mycenaean, states, or, civil, unrest, in, a, number, of, states, as, a, result, of, the, strict, hierarchical, social, system, and, the, ideology, of, the, wanax, in, general, due, to, the, obscure, archaeological, picture, in, 12th, 11th, century, bc, greece, there, is, a, continuing, controversy, among, scholars, over, whether, the, impoverished, societies, that, succeeded, the, mycenaean, palatial, states, were, newcomers, or, populations, that, already, resided, in, mycenaean, greece, recent, archaeological, findings, tend, to, favor, the, latter, scenario, additional, theories, concerning, natural, factors, such, as, climate, change, droughts, or, earthquakes, have, also, been, proposed, another, theory, considers, the, decline, of, the, mycenaean, civilization, as, a, manifestation, of, a, common, pattern, for, the, decline, of, many, ancient, civilizations, the, minoan, the, harappan, and, the, western, roman, empire, the, reason, for, the, decline, is, migration, due, to, overpopulation, the, period, following, the, end, of, mycenaean, greece, c, 1100, 800, bc, is, generally, termed, the, greek, dark, ages, mycenaean, palatial, states, or, centrally, organized, palace, operating, polities, are, recorded, in, ancient, greek, literature, and, mythology, e, g, iliad, catalogue, of, ships, and, confirmed, by, discoveries, made, by, modern, archaeologists, such, as, heinrich, schliemann, each, mycenaean, kingdom, was, governed, from, the, palace, which, exercised, control, over, most, if, not, all, industries, within, its, realm, the, palatial, territory, was, divided, into, several, sub, regions, each, headed, by, its, provincial, center, each, province, was, further, divided, in, smaller, districts, the, damoi, a, number, of, palaces, and, fortifications, appear, to, be, part, of, a, wider, kingdom, for, instance, gla, located, in, the, region, of, boeotia, belonged, to, the, state, of, nearby, orchomenos, moreover, the, palace, of, mycenae, appeared, to, have, ruled, over, a, territory, two, to, three, times, the, size, of, the, other, palatial, states, in, bronze, age, greece, its, territory, would, have, also, included, adjacent, centers, including, tiryns, and, nauplion, which, could, plausibly, be, ruled, by, a, member, of, mycenae, s, ruling, dynasty, the, unearthed, linear, b, texts, are, too, fragmentary, for, the, reconstruction, of, the, political, landscape, in, mycenaean, greece, and, they, do, not, support, nor, deny, the, existence, of, a, larger, mycenaean, state, on, the, other, hand, contemporary, hittite, and, egyptian, records, suggest, the, presence, of, a, single, state, under, a, great, king, alternatively, based, on, archaeological, data, some, sort, of, confederation, among, a, number, of, palatial, states, appears, to, be, possible, if, some, kind, of, united, political, entity, existed, the, dominant, center, was, probably, located, in, thebes, or, in, mycenae, with, the, latter, state, being, the, most, probable, center, of, power, the, neolithic, agrarian, village, 6000, bc, constituted, the, foundation, of, bronze, age, political, culture, in, greece, the, vast, majority, of, the, preserved, linear, b, records, deal, with, administrative, issues, and, give, the, impression, that, mycenaean, palatial, administration, was, highly, systematized, featuring, thoroughly, consistent, language, terminology, tax, calculations, and, distribution, logistics, considering, this, sense, of, uniformity, the, pylos, archive, which, is, the, best, preserved, one, in, the, mycenaean, world, is, generally, taken, as, a, representative, one, the, state, was, ruled, by, a, king, the, wanax, whose, role, was, religious, and, perhaps, also, military, and, judicial, the, wanax, oversaw, virtually, all, aspects, of, palatial, life, from, religious, feasting, and, offerings, to, the, distribution, of, goods, craftsmen, and, troops, under, him, was, the, l, w, getas, the, leader, of, the, people, whose, role, appears, mainly, religious, his, activities, possibly, overlap, with, the, wanax, and, is, usually, seen, as, the, second, in, command, both, wanax, and, l, w, getas, were, at, the, head, of, a, military, aristocracy, known, as, the, eqeta, companions, or, followers, the, land, possessed, by, the, wanax, is, usually, the, t, menos, te, me, no, there, is, also, at, least, one, instance, of, a, person, enkhelyawon, at, pylos, who, appears, titleless, in, the, written, record, but, whom, modern, scholars, regard, as, probably, a, king, a, number, of, local, officials, positioned, by, the, wanax, appear, to, be, in, charge, of, the, districts, such, as, ko, re, te, koreter, governor, po, ro, ko, re, te, prokoreter, deputy, and, the, da, mo, ko, ro, damokoros, one, who, takes, care, of, a, damos, the, latter, probably, being, appointed, to, take, charge, of, the, commune, a, council, of, elders, was, chaired, the, ke, ro, si, ja, cf, gerous, a, the, basileus, who, in, later, greek, society, was, the, name, of, the, king, refers, to, communal, officials, in, general, mycenaean, society, appears, to, have, been, divided, into, two, groups, of, free, men, the, king, s, entourage, who, conducted, administrative, duties, at, the, palace, and, the, people, da, mo, these, last, were, watched, over, by, royal, agents, and, were, obliged, to, perform, duties, for, and, pay, taxes, to, the, palace, among, those, who, could, be, found, in, the, palace, were, well, to, do, high, officials, who, probably, lived, in, the, vast, residences, found, in, proximity, to, mycenaean, palaces, but, also, others, tied, by, their, work, to, the, palace, and, not, necessarily, better, off, than, the, members, of, the, da, mo, such, as, craftsmen, farmers, and, perhaps, merchants, occupying, a, lower, rung, of, the, social, ladder, were, the, slaves, do, e, ro, cf, do, los, these, are, recorded, in, the, texts, as, working, either, for, the, palace, or, for, specific, deities, the, mycenaean, economy, given, its, pre, monetary, nature, was, a, palace, economy, focusing, on, the, redistribution, of, goods, commodities, and, labor, by, a, central, administration, the, preserved, linear, b, records, in, pylos, and, knossos, indicate, that, the, palaces, were, closely, monitoring, a, variety, of, industries, and, commodities, the, organization, of, land, management, and, the, rations, given, to, the, dependent, personnel, the, mycenaean, palaces, maintained, extensive, control, of, the, nondomestic, areas, of, production, through, careful, control, and, acquisition, and, distribution, in, the, palace, industries, and, the, tallying, of, produced, goods, for, instance, the, knossos, tablets, record, c, 80, 000, 100, 000, sheep, grazing, in, central, crete, and, the, quantity, of, the, expected, wool, from, these, sheep, and, their, offspring, as, well, as, how, this, wool, was, allocated, the, archives, of, pylos, display, a, specialized, workforce, where, each, worker, belonged, to, a, precise, category, and, was, assigned, to, a, specific, task, in, the, stages, of, production, notably, in, textiles, nevertheless, palatial, control, over, resources, appears, to, have, been, highly, selective, in, spatial, terms, and, in, terms, of, how, different, industries, were, managed, thus, sectors, like, the, production, of, perfumed, oil, and, bronze, materials, were, directly, monitored, from, the, palace, but, the, production, of, ceramics, was, only, indirectly, monitored, regional, transactions, between, the, palaces, are, also, recorded, on, a, few, occasions, the, palatial, centers, organized, their, workforce, and, resources, for, the, construction, of, large, scale, projects, in, the, fields, of, agriculture, and, industry, the, magnitude, of, some, projects, indicates, that, this, was, the, result, of, combined, efforts, from, multiple, palatial, centers, most, notable, of, them, are, the, drainage, system, of, the, kopais, basin, in, boeotia, the, building, of, a, large, dam, outside, tiryns, and, the, drainage, of, the, swamp, in, the, nemea, valley, also, noticeable, is, the, construction, of, harbors, such, as, the, harbor, of, pylos, that, were, capable, of, accommodating, large, bronze, age, era, vessels, like, the, one, found, at, uluburun, the, mycenaean, economy, also, featured, large, scale, manufacturing, as, testified, by, the, extent, of, workshop, complexes, that, have, been, discovered, the, largest, known, to, date, being, the, recent, ceramic, and, hydraulic, installations, found, in, euonymeia, next, to, athens, that, produced, tableware, textiles, sails, and, ropes, for, export, and, shipbuilding, the, most, famous, project, of, the, mycenaean, era, was, the, network, of, roads, in, the, peloponnese, this, appears, to, have, facilitated, the, speedy, deployment, of, troops, for, example, the, remnants, of, a, mycenaean, road, along, with, what, appears, to, have, been, a, mycenaean, defensive, wall, on, the, isthmus, of, corinth, the, mycenaean, era, saw, the, zenith, of, infrastructure, engineering, in, greece, and, this, appears, not, to, have, been, limited, to, the, argive, plain, trade, over, vast, areas, of, the, mediterranean, was, essential, for, the, economy, of, mycenaean, greece, the, mycenaean, palaces, imported, raw, materials, such, as, metals, ivory, and, glass, and, exported, processed, commodities, and, objects, made, from, these, materials, in, addition, to, local, products, oil, perfume, wine, wool, and, pottery, international, trade, of, that, time, was, not, only, conducted, by, palatial, emissaries, but, also, by, independent, merchants, based, on, archaeological, findings, in, the, middle, east, in, particular, physical, artifacts, textual, references, inscriptions, and, wall, paintings, it, appears, that, mycenaean, greeks, achieved, strong, commercial, and, cultural, interaction, with, most, of, the, bronze, age, people, living, in, this, region, canaanites, kassites, mitanni, assyrians, and, egyptians, the, 14th, century, bc, uluburun, shipwreck, off, the, coast, of, southern, anatolia, displays, the, established, trade, routes, that, supplied, the, mycenaeans, with, all, the, raw, materials, and, items, that, the, economy, of, mycenaean, greece, needed, such, as, copper, and, tin, for, the, production, of, bronze, products, a, chief, export, of, the, mycenaeans, was, olive, oil, which, was, a, multi, purpose, product, cyprus, appears, to, be, the, principal, intermediary, station, between, mycenaean, greece, and, the, middle, east, based, on, the, considerable, greater, quantities, of, mycenaean, goods, found, there, on, the, other, hand, trade, with, the, hittite, lands, in, central, anatolia, appears, to, have, been, limited, trade, with, troy, is, also, well, attested, while, mycenaean, trade, routes, expanded, further, to, the, bosphorus, and, the, shores, of, the, black, sea, mycenaean, swords, have, been, found, as, far, away, as, georgia, in, the, eastern, black, sea, coast, commercial, interaction, was, also, intense, with, the, italian, peninsula, and, the, western, mediterranean, mycenaean, products, especially, pottery, were, exported, to, southern, italy, sicily, and, the, aeolian, islands, mycenaean, products, also, penetrated, further, into, sardinia, as, well, as, southern, spain, sporadic, objects, of, mycenaean, manufacture, were, found, in, various, distant, locations, like, in, central, europe, such, as, in, bavaria, germany, where, an, amber, object, inscribed, with, linear, b, symbols, has, been, unearthed, mycenaean, bronze, double, axes, and, other, objects, dating, from, the, 13th, century, bc, have, been, found, in, ireland, and, in, wessex, and, cornwall, in, england, anthropologists, have, found, traces, of, opium, in, mycenaean, ceramic, vases, the, drug, trade, in, mycenaean, greece, is, traced, as, early, as, 1650, 1350, bc, with, opium, poppies, being, traded, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, temples, and, shrines, are, strangely, rare, in, the, mycenaean, archaeological, sites, monumental, cultic, structures, are, absent, at, all, the, palatial, centers, with, the, exception, of, mycenae, however, the, cultic, center, of, mycenae, seems, to, have, been, a, later, 13th, century, bc, development, small, shrines, have, been, identified, in, asine, berbati, malthi, and, pylos, while, a, number, of, sacred, enclosures, have, been, located, near, mycenae, delphi, and, amyclae, linear, b, records, mention, a, number, of, sanctuaries, dedicated, to, a, variety, of, deities, at, least, in, pylos, and, knossos, they, also, indicate, that, there, were, various, religious, festivities, including, offerings, written, mycenaean, records, mention, various, priests, and, priestesses, who, were, responsible, for, specific, shrines, and, temples, the, latter, were, prominent, figures, in, society, and, the, role, of, mycenaean, women, in, religious, festivities, was, also, important, just, as, in, minoan, crete, the, mycenaean, pantheon, already, included, many, divinities, that, were, subsequently, encountered, in, classical, greece, although, it, is, difficult, to, determine, whether, these, deities, had, the, characteristics, and, responsibilities, that, would, be, attributed, to, them, in, later, periods, in, general, the, same, divinities, were, worshipped, throughout, the, mycenaean, palatial, world, there, may, be, some, indications, for, local, deities, at, various, sites, in, particular, in, crete, the, uniformity, of, mycenaean, religion, is, also, reflected, in, archaeological, evidence, with, the, phi, and, psi, figurines, that, have, been, found, all, over, late, bronze, age, greece, poseidon, linear, b, po, se, da, o, seems, to, have, occupied, a, place, of, privilege, he, was, a, chthonic, deity, connected, with, earthquakes, e, ne, si, da, o, ne, earth, shaker, but, it, seems, that, he, also, represented, the, river, spirit, of, the, underworld, paean, pa, ja, wo, is, probably, the, precursor, of, the, greek, physician, of, the, gods, in, homer, s, iliad, he, was, the, personification, of, the, magic, song, which, was, supposed, to, heal, the, patient, a, number, of, divinities, have, been, identified, in, the, mycenaean, scripts, only, by, their, epithets, used, during, later, antiquity, for, example, qo, wi, ja, cow, eyed, is, a, standard, homeric, epithet, of, hera, ares, appeared, under, the, name, enyalios, assuming, that, enyalios, is, not, a, separate, god, additional, divinities, that, can, be, also, found, in, later, periods, include, hephaestus, erinya, artemis, a, te, mi, to, and, a, ti, mi, te, and, dionysos, di, wo, nu, so, zeus, also, appears, in, the, mycenaean, pantheon, but, he, was, certainly, not, the, chief, deity, a, collection, of, ladies, or, mistresses, po, ti, ni, ja, potnia, are, named, in, the, mycenaean, scripts, as, such, athena, a, ta, na, appears, in, an, inscription, at, knossos, as, mistress, athena, similar, to, a, later, homeric, expression, but, in, the, pylos, tablets, she, is, mentioned, without, any, accompanying, word, si, to, po, ti, ni, ja, appears, to, be, an, agricultural, goddess, possibly, related, to, demeter, of, later, antiquity, while, in, knossos, there, is, the, mistress, of, the, labyrinth, the, two, queens, and, the, king, wa, na, ssoi, wa, na, ka, te, are, mentioned, in, pylos, goddess, pe, re, swa, mentioned, may, be, related, to, persephone, a, number, of, mycenaean, divinities, seem, to, have, no, later, equivalents, such, as, marineus, diwia, and, komawenteia, by, observing, mycenaean, wall, paintings, scholars, have, deduced, that, women, during, this, time, often, wore, long, dresses, their, hair, long, and, wore, jewelry, most, notably, beads, mycenaean, beads, have, long, been, an, aspect, of, mycenaean, culture, that, is, shrouded, in, a, significant, amount, of, mystery, it, is, not, known, for, certain, why, they, men, women, and, children, wore, them, or, why, they, appear, to, have, been, significant, to, the, culture, but, beads, made, of, carnelian, lapis, lazuli, etc, were, known, to, have, been, worn, by, women, on, bracelets, necklaces, and, buttons, on, cloaks, and, were, often, buried, with, the, deceased, in, later, periods, of, greek, history, seclusion, of, females, from, males, was, common, in, the, household, though, scholars, have, found, no, evidence, of, seclusion, during, mycenaean, times, and, believe, that, males, and, females, worked, with, and, around, each, other, on, a, regular, basis, not, much, is, known, about, women, s, duties, in, the, home, or, whether, they, differed, from, the, duties, of, men, and, though, men, were, involved, in, warfare, and, hunting, there, is, no, evidence, that, suggests, women, ever, took, part, in, either, of, the, two, though, whether, women, took, part, in, hunting, has, been, up, for, debate, amongst, some, historians, there, is, evidence, that, in, this, patriarchal, society, men, and, women, were, in, some, respects, viewed, equally, mycenae, practiced, a, system, of, rationing, food, to, citizens, and, evidence, shows, that, women, received, the, same, amount, of, rations, as, men, if, women, were, not, officials, in, the, cult, or, married, to, high, ranking, male, officers, they, were, likely, low, ranking, laborers, linear, b, details, specialized, groups, of, female, laborers, called, workgroups, these, women, labored, with, other, women, as, well, as, their, children, and, usually, were, located, close, to, the, palace, women, who, belonged, to, workgroups, did, not, belong, to, independent, households, but, were, managed, and, fed, by, palace, scribes, all, of, the, women, in, a, workgroup, would, serve, the, same, occupation, such, as, textiles, women, in, workgroups, are, not, believed, to, have, been, able, to, acquire, land, holdings, or, have, had, economic, independence, of, any, kind, and, are, believed, by, some, to, have, been, slaves, though, there, are, some, conflicting, debates, among, scholars, concerning, this, though, scholars, are, unsure, if, ordinary, women, could, obtain, land, and, exert, economic, power, there, is, evidence, that, women, could, obtain, positions, of, power, such, as, the, title, of, priestess, which, allowed, them, to, have, land, holdings, have, elite, connections, and, high, social, status, mycenaean, society, is, believed, to, have, been, largely, patriarchal, but, women, could, exert, social, and, economic, power, through, titles, and, positions, of, power, like, that, of, a, priestess, though, religion, was, not, the, only, place, that, a, woman, could, gain, social, authority, women, with, special, talents, or, skills, such, as, being, a, skilled, midwife, or, craftswomen, could, gain, social, authority, in, their, villages, but, are, not, believed, to, have, been, able, to, receive, land, holdings, elite, women, those, who, were, married, to, male, elites, were, afforded, benefits, fitting, their, high, social, standing, but, even, the, wife, of, elites, could, not, own, land, and, had, no, economic, independence, some, scholars, believe, that, knossos, was, probably, more, equal, in, relation, to, gender, than, pylos, though, the, evidence, for, this, is, little, and, is, highly, disputed, men, and, women, alike, were, involved, in, cult, activity, some, women, could, be, elevated, to, becoming, legally, independent, by, becoming, priestesses, which, appears, to, be, hereditary, through, both, the, male, and, female, line, no, woman, in, mycenae, is, believed, to, have, been, able, to, own, land, at, this, time, but, priestesses, were, women, who, could, legally, procure, land, through, the, cult, land, was, leased, to, them, rather, than, given, to, them, in, ownership, along, with, land, holding, benefits, priestesses, often, had, ties, with, the, upper, class, elites, and, were, usually, wealthy, themselves, only, a, small, number, of, women, could, become, priestesses, in, mycenae, but, there, were, other, cultic, titles, that, women, could, aspire, to, obtain, such, as, that, of, key, bearer, key, bearers, appear, to, be, women, who, had, authority, over, the, sacred, treasury, of, a, particular, deity, and, were, able, to, dispense, it, in, times, of, need, though, scholars, do, not, have, enough, evidence, to, suggest, that, all, key, bearers, could, own, land, and, had, high, status, there, is, a, written, record, in, linear, b, of, a, key, bearer, with, elite, ties, who, owned, land, so, it, is, possible, that, they, had, similar, benefits, to, priestesses, other, religious, roles, filled, by, women, were, the, three, types, of, sacred, slaves, slave, of, the, god, slave, of, the, priestess, and, slave, of, the, key, bearer, though, not, as, grand, a, title, as, that, of, priestess, of, key, bearer, the, sacred, slaves, were, allotted, certain, benefits, fitting, their, positions, in, the, cult, one, other, documented, position, women, filled, in, the, cult, was, called, ki, ri, te, wi, ja, though, documented, scholars, are, not, certain, exactly, what, the, duties, of, this, role, entailed, or, what, type, of, women, would, have, filled, it, what, they, do, know, however, is, that, these, religious, roles, afforded, the, women, who, occupied, them, a, certain, amount, of, economic, autonomy, the, palatial, structures, at, mycenae, tiryns, and, pylos, were, erected, on, the, summits, of, hills, or, rocky, outcrops, dominating, the, immediate, surroundings, the, best, preserved, are, found, in, pylos, and, tiryns, while, mycenae, and, the, menelaion, are, only, partially, preserved, in, central, greece, thebes, and, orchomenos, have, been, only, partially, exposed, on, the, other, hand, the, palace, built, at, the, acropolis, of, athens, has, been, almost, completely, destroyed, a, substantial, building, at, dimini, in, thessaly, possibly, ancient, iolcos, is, believed, by, a, number, of, archaeologists, to, be, a, palace, a, mycenaean, palace, has, been, also, unearthed, in, laconia, near, the, modern, village, of, xirokambi, the, palatial, structures, of, mainland, greece, share, a, number, of, common, features, the, focal, point, of, the, socio, political, aspect, of, a, mycenaean, palace, was, the, megaron, the, throne, room, it, was, laid, out, around, a, circular, hearth, surrounded, by, four, columns, the, throne, was, generally, found, on, the, right, hand, side, upon, entering, the, room, while, the, interior, of, the, megaron, was, lavishly, decorated, flaunting, images, designed, intentionally, to, demonstrate, the, political, and, religious, power, of, the, ruler, access, to, the, megaron, was, provided, through, a, court, which, was, reached, from, a, propylon, the, iconography, of, the, palatial, chambers, is, remarkably, uniform, throughout, greece, for, instance, in, pylos, and, tiryns, the, paintings, are, focused, on, marine, motifs, providing, depictions, of, octopodes, fish, and, dolphins, around, the, megaron, a, group, of, courtyards, each, opened, upon, several, rooms, of, different, dimensions, such, as, storerooms, and, workshops, as, well, as, reception, halls, and, living, quarters, in, general, mycenaean, palaces, have, yielded, a, wealth, of, artifacts, and, fragmentary, frescoes, additional, common, features, are, shared, by, the, palaces, of, pylos, mycenae, and, tiryns, a, large, court, with, colonnades, lies, directly, in, front, of, the, central, megaron, while, a, second, but, smaller, megaron, is, also, found, inside, these, structures, the, staircases, in, the, palace, of, pylos, indicate, that, the, palaces, had, two, stories, the, private, quarters, of, the, members, of, the, royal, family, were, presumably, located, on, the, first, floor, the, construction, of, defensive, structures, was, closely, linked, to, the, establishment, of, the, palaces, in, mainland, greece, the, principal, mycenaean, centers, were, well, fortified, and, usually, situated, on, an, elevated, terrain, like, on, the, acropolis, of, athens, tiryns, and, mycenae, or, on, coastal, plains, in, the, case, of, gla, mycenaean, greeks, in, general, appreciated, the, symbolism, of, war, as, expressed, in, defensive, architecture, reflected, by, the, visual, impressiveness, of, their, fortifications, cyclopean, is, the, term, normally, applied, to, the, masonry, characteristics, of, mycenaean, fortification, systems, and, describes, walls, built, of, large, unworked, boulders, more, than, 8, m, 26, ft, thick, and, weighing, several, metric, tonnes, they, were, roughly, fitted, together, without, the, use, of, mortar, or, clay, to, bind, them, though, smaller, hunks, of, limestone, fill, the, interstices, their, placement, formed, a, polygonal, pattern, giving, the, curtain, wall, an, irregular, but, imposing, appearance, at, the, top, it, would, have, been, wide, enough, for, a, walkway, with, a, narrow, protective, parapet, on, the, outer, edge, and, with, hoop, like, crenellations, the, term, cyclopean, was, derived, by, the, latter, greeks, of, the, classical, era, who, believed, that, only, the, mythical, giants, the, cyclopes, could, have, constructed, such, megalithic, structures, on, the, other, hand, cut, stone, masonry, is, used, only, in, and, around, gateways, another, typical, feature, of, mycenaean, megalithic, construction, was, the, use, of, a, relieving, triangle, above, a, lintel, block, an, opening, often, triangular, designed, to, reduce, the, weight, over, the, lintel, the, space, was, filled, with, some, lighter, stone, cyclopean, fortifications, were, typical, of, mycenaean, walls, especially, at, the, citadels, of, mycenae, tiryns, argos, crisa, and, athens, while, smaller, boulders, are, found, in, midea, and, large, limestone, slabs, are, found, at, gla, in, the, mycenaean, settlements, found, in, epirus, and, cyprus, cyclopean, style, walls, are, also, present, as, well, as, in, western, anatolia, besides, the, citadels, isolated, forts, were, also, erected, on, various, strategic, locations, the, fortification, systems, also, incorporated, technical, refinements, such, as, secret, cisterns, galleries, sally, ports, and, projecting, bastions, for, the, protection, of, gateways, on, the, other, hand, the, palace, of, pylos, although, a, major, center, of, power, paradoxically, appears, to, have, been, left, without, any, defensive, walls, mycenaean, domestic, architecture, originates, mainly, from, earlier, middle, helladic, traditions, c, 2000, 1650, bc, both, in, shape, as, well, as, in, location, of, settlement, the, observed, uniformity, in, domestic, architecture, came, probably, as, a, result, of, a, shared, past, among, the, communities, of, the, greek, mainland, rather, than, as, a, consequence, of, cultural, expansion, of, the, mycenaean, koine, moreover, varying, sizes, of, mudbricks, were, used, in, the, construction, of, buildings, contrary, to, popular, belief, some, mycenaean, representative, buildings, already, featured, roofs, made, of, fired, tiles, as, in, gla, and, midea, the, military, nature, of, the, mycenaean, greeks, is, evident, from, the, numerous, weapons, unearthed, the, use, of, warrior, and, combat, representations, in, contemporary, art, and, the, preserved, greek, linear, b, records, the, mycenaeans, invested, in, the, development, of, military, infrastructure, with, military, production, and, logistics, being, supervised, directly, from, the, palatial, centers, according, to, the, linear, b, records, in, the, palace, of, pylos, every, rural, community, the, damos, was, obliged, to, supply, a, certain, number, of, men, who, had, to, serve, in, the, army, similar, service, was, also, performed, by, the, aristocracy, mycenaean, armies, were, initially, based, on, heavy, infantry, equipped, with, spears, large, shields, and, on, some, occasions, armor, later, in, the, 13th, century, bc, mycenaean, warfare, underwent, major, changes, both, in, tactics, and, weaponry, and, armed, units, became, more, uniform, and, flexible, while, weapons, became, smaller, and, lighter, the, spear, remained, the, main, weapon, among, mycenaean, warriors, while, the, sword, played, a, secondary, role, in, combat, other, offensive, weapons, used, were, bows, maces, axes, slings, and, javelins, the, precise, role, and, contribution, of, chariots, on, the, battlefield, is, a, matter, of, dispute, due, to, the, lack, of, sufficient, evidence, it, appears, that, chariots, were, initially, used, as, fighting, vehicles, during, the, 16th, to, 14th, centuries, bc, while, later, in, the, 13th, century, bc, their, role, was, limited, to, battlefield, transport, the, boar, s, tusk, helmet, was, the, most, identifiable, piece, of, mycenaean, armor, in, use, from, the, beginning, to, the, collapse, of, mycenaean, culture, it, is, also, known, from, several, depictions, in, contemporary, art, in, greece, and, the, mediterranean, a, representative, piece, of, mycenaean, armor, is, the, dendra, panoply, c, 1450, 1400, bc, which, consisted, of, a, cuirass, of, a, complete, set, of, armor, made, up, of, several, elements, of, bronze, in, general, most, features, of, the, later, hoplite, panoply, of, classical, greek, antiquity, were, already, known, to, mycenaean, greece, figure, of, eight, shields, were, the, most, common, type, of, mycenaean, shields, during, the, late, mycenaean, period, smaller, types, of, shields, were, adopted, either, of, completely, circular, shape, or, almost, circular, with, a, part, cut, out, from, their, lower, edge, most, of, the, finest, mycenaean, art, comes, under, the, immediate, suspicion, of, either, being, minoan, art, actually, imported, from, crete, or, produced, on, the, mainland, by, cretan, or, cretan, trained, artists, this, is, less, true, of, pottery, although, the, very, untypical, mycenaean, palace, amphora, with, octopus, nama, 6725, clearly, derives, directly, from, the, minoan, marine, style, and, it, ceases, to, be, the, case, after, about, 1350, bc, some, works, appear, to, have, subjects, adjusted, to, warlike, mycenaean, tastes, although, the, distinctively, minoan, subject, of, bull, leaping, also, appears, the, production, of, luxury, art, for, and, probably, often, in, the, minoan, palaces, was, already, a, well, established, tradition, when, mycenaean, elites, became, customers, and, was, perhaps, more, integrated, into, minoan, religion, and, culture, than, it, ever, became, in, mycenaean, greece, several, important, pieces, in, gold, and, other, metals, come, from, the, gold, grave, goods, at, grave, circles, a, and, b, at, mycenae, including, the, mask, of, agamemnon, silver, siege, rhyton, bulls, head, rhyton, and, gold, nestor, s, cup, the, chemical, compositions, of, the, silver, objects, indicate, that, the, silver, was, sourced, from, several, locations, the, theseus, ring, found, in, athens, is, one, of, the, finest, of, a, number, of, gold, signet, rings, with, tiny, multi, figure, scenes, of, high, quality, many, from, the, princely, grave, circles, a, and, b, at, mycenae, these, tend, to, be, regarded, as, cretan, as, do, the, carved, gemstones, also, found, in, elite, graves, though, they, collected, them, the, mycenaean, elite, did, not, apparently, use, minoan, seals, for, authenticating, anything, but, treated, them, as, ornaments, at, least, one, prince, wearing, a, collection, around, his, wrists, like, modern, charm, bracelets, sinclair, hood, believed, that, at, the, time, of, the, vaphio, burial, c, 1500, 1450, it, was, broadly, speaking, possible, to, classify, the, finer, seals, as, being, of, cretan, the, more, crudely, engraved, of, mainland, manufacture, but, that, this, criterion, no, longer, applies, after, the, mainland, conquest, of, crete, c, 1450, during, the, late, mycenaean, period, 1400, 1200, bc, mycenaean, vessels, pottery, exhibited, similarities, spanning, a, significant, area, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, i, e, from, the, levant, to, sicily, and, possibly, reflecting, a, form, of, economic, and, political, union, centered, at, mycenae, however, the, minoan, pottery, of, crete, during, this, time, remained, distinct, indicating, a, degree, of, autonomy, on, the, island, the, mycenaean, greeks, produced, in, large, quantities, a, variety, of, diversely, styled, vessels, such, as, stirrup, jars, large, bowls, alabastron, krater, and, stemmed, cups, or, kylikes, resembling, champagne, glasses, stirrup, jars, linear, b, ka, ra, re, u, khlareus, oil, vessel, specifically, were, first, invented, on, the, island, of, crete, during, the, 16th, century, bc, and, used, widely, by, the, mycenaeans, from, 1400, bc, onward, for, transporting, and, storing, wine, and, oil, the, jars, were, usually, pear, shaped, or, globular, as, for, stemmed, cups, or, kylikes, they, evolved, from, ephyraean, goblets, and, a, large, quantity, was, discovered, at, a, site, called, the, potter, s, shop, located, in, zygouries, mycenaean, drinking, vessels, such, as, the, stemmed, cups, contained, single, decorative, motifs, such, as, a, shell, an, octopus, or, a, flower, painted, on, the, side, facing, away, from, the, drinker, the, mycenaean, greeks, also, painted, entire, scenes, called, pictorial, style, on, their, vessels, depicting, warriors, chariots, horses, and, deities, reminiscent, of, events, described, in, homer, s, iliad, other, items, developed, by, the, mycenaeans, include, clay, lamps, as, well, as, metallic, vessels, such, as, bronze, tripod, cauldrons, or, basins, a, few, examples, of, vessels, in, faience, and, ivory, are, also, known, the, mycenaean, period, has, not, yielded, sculpture, of, any, great, size, the, statuary, of, the, period, consists, for, the, most, part, of, small, terracotta, figurines, found, at, almost, every, mycenaean, site, in, mainland, greece, in, tombs, in, settlement, debris, and, occasionally, in, cult, contexts, tiryns, agios, konstantinos, on, methana, the, majority, of, these, figurines, are, female, and, anthropomorphic, or, zoomorphic, the, female, figurines, can, be, subdivided, into, three, groups, which, were, popular, at, different, periods, the, psi, and, phi, type, figurines, and, the, tau, type, the, earliest, are, the, phi, type, which, look, like, the, greek, letter, phi, their, arms, give, the, upper, body, a, rounded, shape, the, psi, type, looks, like, the, letter, psi, these, have, outstretched, upraised, arms, the, latest, 12th, century, bc, are, the, tau, type, these, figurines, look, like, the, greek, letter, tau, with, folded, arms, at, right, angles, to, the, body, most, figurines, wear, a, large, polos, they, are, painted, with, stripes, or, zigzags, in, the, same, manner, as, the, contemporary, pottery, and, presumably, made, by, the, same, potters, their, purpose, is, uncertain, but, they, may, have, served, as, both, votive, objects, and, toys, some, are, found, in, children, s, graves, but, the, vast, majority, of, fragments, are, from, domestic, rubbish, deposits, the, presence, of, many, of, these, figurines, on, sites, where, worship, took, place, in, the, archaic, and, classical, periods, approximately, 200, below, the, sanctuary, of, athena, at, delphi, others, at, the, temple, of, aphaea, on, aegina, at, the, sanctuary, of, apollo, maleatas, above, epidauros, and, at, amyclae, near, sparta, suggests, both, that, many, were, indeed, religious, in, nature, perhaps, as, votives, but, also, that, later, places, of, worship, may, well, have, first, been, used, in, the, mycenaean, period, larger, male, female, or, bovine, terracotta, wheelmade, figures, are, much, rarer, an, important, group, was, found, in, the, temple, at, mycenae, together, with, coiled, clay, snakes, while, others, have, been, found, at, tiryns, and, in, the, east, and, west, shrines, at, phylakopi, on, the, island, of, melos, the, painting, of, the, mycenaean, age, was, much, influenced, by, that, of, minoan, painting, and, was, probably, at, least, initially, by, cretan, painters, their, style, gradually, drifts, away, from, that, of, crete, and, in, late, periods, greatly, reduces, in, quality, fragments, of, wall, paintings, have, been, found, in, or, around, the, palaces, pylos, mycenae, tiryns, and, in, domestic, contexts, zygouries, the, largest, complete, wall, painting, depicting, three, female, figures, probably, goddesses, was, found, in, the, so, called, cult, center, at, mycenae, various, subjects, are, represented, hunting, bull, leaping, tauromachy, battle, scenes, processions, etc, some, scenes, may, be, part, of, mythological, narratives, but, if, so, their, meaning, eludes, us, other, frescoes, include, geometric, or, stylised, motifs, also, used, on, painted, pottery, see, above, the, usual, form, of, burial, during, this, period, was, inhumation, burial, in, the, earth, covered, by, dirt, and, stones, the, earliest, mycenaean, burials, were, mostly, in, individual, graves, in, the, form, of, a, pit, or, a, stone, lined, cist, and, offerings, were, limited, to, pottery, and, occasional, items, of, jewellery, groups, of, pit, or, cist, graves, containing, elite, members, of, the, community, were, sometimes, covered, by, a, tumulus, mound, in, the, manner, established, since, the, middle, helladic, it, has, been, argued, that, this, form, dates, back, to, the, kurgan, culture, however, mycenaean, burials, are, in, actuality, an, indigenous, development, of, mainland, greece, with, the, shaft, graves, housing, native, rulers, pit, and, cist, graves, remained, in, use, for, single, burials, throughout, the, mycenaean, period, alongside, more, elaborate, family, graves, the, shaft, graves, at, mycenae, within, grave, circles, a, and, b, belonging, to, the, same, period, represent, an, alternative, manner, of, grouping, elite, burials, next, to, the, deceased, were, found, full, sets, of, weapons, ornate, staffs, as, well, as, gold, and, silver, cups, and, other, valuable, objects, which, point, to, their, social, rank, beginning, also, in, the, late, helladic, period, are, to, be, seen, communal, tombs, of, rectangular, form, nevertheless, it, is, difficult, to, establish, whether, the, different, forms, of, burial, represent, a, social, hierarchization, as, was, formerly, thought, with, the, tholos, being, the, tombs, of, the, elite, rulers, the, individual, tombs, those, of, the, leisure, class, and, the, communal, tombs, those, of, the, people, cremations, increased, in, number, over, the, course, of, the, period, becoming, quite, numerous, in, the, last, phase, of, the, mycenaean, era, the, tholos, was, introduced, during, the, early, 15th, century, bc, as, the, new, and, more, imposing, form, of, elite, burial, the, most, impressive, tombs, of, the, mycenaean, era, are, the, monumental, royal, tombs, of, mycenae, undoubtedly, intended, for, the, royal, family, of, the, city, the, most, famous, is, the, treasury, of, atreus, a, tholos, a, total, of, nine, of, such, tholos, tombs, are, found, in, the, region, of, mycenae, while, six, of, them, belong, to, a, single, period, late, helladic, iia, c, 1400, 1300, bc, it, has, been, argued, that, different, dynasties, or, factions, may, have, competed, through, conspicuous, burial, with, respect, to, mycenaean, cuisine, skewer, trays, were, discovered, in, gla, mycenae, and, pylos, the, so, called, souvlaki, trays, or, portable, grills, used, by, the, mycenaean, greeks, were, rectangular, ceramic, pans, that, sat, underneath, skewers, of, meat, it, is, not, clear, whether, these, trays, would, have, been, placed, directly, over, a, fire, or, if, the, pans, would, have, held, hot, coals, like, a, portable, barbecue, pit, in, c, 1600, bc, the, mycenaean, greeks, borrowed, from, the, minoan, civilization, its, syllabic, writing, system, i, e, linear, a, and, developed, their, own, syllabic, script, known, as, linear, b, the, linear, b, script, was, utilized, by, the, mycenaean, palaces, in, greece, for, administrative, purposes, where, economic, transactions, were, recorded, on, clay, tablets, and, some, pottery, in, the, mycenaean, dialect, of, the, greek, language, the, linear, b, tablets, were, first, discovered, in, crete, by, english, archaeologist, sir, arthur, evans, c, 1900, and, later, deciphered, by, english, architect, and, cryptographer, michael, ventris, in, 1952, ventris, s, discovery, of, an, archaic, greek, dialect, in, the, linear, b, tablets, demonstrated, that, mycenaean, greek, was, the, oldest, known, greek, dialect, elements, of, which, survived, in, homer, s, language, as, a, result, of, a, long, oral, tradition, of, epic, poetry, the, written, records, of, every, mycenaean, region, were, similar, but, the, scribes, sometimes, used, words, that, were, probably, part, of, their, local, dialect, the, existence, of, a, common, language, is, probably, explained, by, their, shared, bureaucratic, system, and, writing, script, in, the, 8th, century, bc, after, the, end, of, the, so, called, greek, dark, ages, greece, emerged, with, a, network, of, myths, and, legends, the, greatest, of, all, being, that, of, the, trojan, epic, cycle, in, general, the, greeks, of, classical, antiquity, idealized, the, mycenaean, period, as, a, glorious, period, of, heroes, closeness, of, the, gods, and, material, wealth, the, legends, of, homer, s, epics, were, especially, and, generally, accepted, as, part, of, the, greek, past, and, it, was, not, until, the, 19th, century, that, scholars, began, to, question, homer, s, historicity, at, this, time, german, archaeologist, heinrich, schliemann, undertook, the, first, modern, archaeological, excavations, in, greece, at, the, site, of, mycenae, in, 1876, thus, schliemann, set, out, to, prove, the, historical, accuracy, of, the, iliad, by, identifying, the, places, described, by, homer, as, part, of, the, mycenaean, heritage, that, survived, the, names, of, the, gods, and, goddesses, of, mycenaean, greece, became, major, figures, of, the, olympian, pantheon, of, later, antiquity, moreover, the, language, of, the, mycenaeans, offers, the, first, written, evidence, of, greek, while, a, significant, part, of, the, mycenaean, vocabulary, can, also, be, found, in, modern, english, the, mycenaean, greeks, were, also, pioneers, in, the, field, of, engineering, launching, large, scale, projects, unmatched, in, europe, until, the, roman, period, such, as, fortifications, bridges, culverts, aqueducts, dams, and, roads, suitable, for, wheeled, traffic, they, also, made, several, architectural, innovations, such, as, the, relieving, triangle, they, were, also, responsible, for, transmitting, a, wide, range, of, arts, and, crafts, especially, of, minoan, origin, the, mycenaean, civilization, was, in, general, more, advanced, compared, to, the, late, bronze, age, cultures, of, the, rest, of, europe, several, mycenaean, attributes, and, achievements, were, borrowed, or, held, in, high, regard, in, later, periods, so, it, would, be, no, exaggeration, to, consider, mycenaean, greece, as, a, cradle, of, civilization, there, are, scholars, who, identify, the, sea, peoples, who, migrated, to, the, near, east, as, mycenaean, greeks, in, a, 2020, study, by, polish, historian, ukasz, niesio, owski, span, a, group, of, people, known, from, the, bible, the, levites, were, linguistically, identified, with, the, greek, term, la, wo, in, later, greek, laoi, the, people, or, armed, men, niesio, owski, span, concluded, that, the, levites, were, a, group, of, mycenaean, greek, mercenaries, who, managed, to, settle, down, in, canaan, and, integrate, with, the, local, population, preserving, their, own, group, name, a, cephalometric, analysis, by, argyropoulos, et, al, 1989, published, in, the, angle, orthodontist, showed, remarkable, similarity, in, craniofacial, morphology, between, ancient, greeks, including, mycenaeans, and, modern, greeks, suggesting, a, close, affinity, and, that, the, greek, ethnic, group, remained, stable, in, its, cephalic, and, facial, morphology, for, the, last, 4, 000, years, a, craniofacial, morphological, study, by, papagrigorakis, et, al, 2014, published, in, anthropologischer, anzeiger, also, indicated, craniological, similarities, between, modern, greeks, and, ancient, greeks, including, mycenaeans, indicating, continuity, in, an, archaeogenetic, study, published, in, nature, lazaridis, et, al, 2017, found, that, minoans, and, mycenaean, greeks, were, genetically, highly, similar, but, not, identical, modern, greeks, resembled, the, mycenaeans, but, with, some, additional, dilution, of, the, early, neolithic, ancestry, furthermore, proposed, migrations, by, egyptian, or, phoenician, colonists, was, not, discernible, in, their, data, thus, rejecting, the, hypothesis, that, the, cultures, of, the, aegean, were, seeded, by, migrants, from, the, old, civilizations, of, these, regions, the, f, st, between, the, sampled, bronze, age, populations, and, present, day, west, eurasians, was, estimated, finding, that, mycenaean, greeks, and, minoans, were, least, differentiated, from, the, populations, of, modern, greece, cyprus, albania, and, italy, a, genetic, study, by, clemente, et, al, 2021, found, that, in, the, early, bronze, age, the, populations, of, the, minoan, helladic, and, cycladic, civilizations, in, the, aegean, were, genetically, homogeneous, in, contrast, during, the, middle, bronze, age, this, population, was, more, differentiated, probably, due, to, gene, flow, from, a, yamnaya, related, population, from, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, this, is, corroborated, by, sequenced, genomes, of, middle, bronze, age, individuals, from, northern, greece, who, had, a, much, higher, proportion, of, steppe, related, ancestry, the, timing, of, this, gene, flow, was, estimated, at, 2, 300, bce, and, is, consistent, with, the, dominant, linguistic, theories, explaining, the, emergence, of, the, proto, greek, language, present, day, greeks, share, about, 90, of, their, ancestry, with, them, suggesting, continuity, between, the, two, time, periods, in, the, case, of, mycenaeans, however, this, steppe, related, ancestry, was, diluted, the, ancestry, of, the, mycenaeans, could, be, explained, via, a, 2, way, admixture, model, of, such, mba, individuals, in, northern, greece, and, either, an, eba, aegean, or, mba, minoan, population, a, study, by, lazaridis, et, al, 2022, analysed, 21, new, mycenaean, samples, and, one, new, minoan, sample, along, with, previously, published, samples, the, study, found, that, mycenaeans, were, differentiated, from, minoans, by, an, influx, of, western, steppe, yamnaya, like, ancestry, with, mycenaean, samples, having, approximately, 8, 6, 2, steppe, yamnaya, like, ancestry, on, average, comprising, 4, 3, 1, eastern, european, hunter, gatherer, ehg, ancestry, on, average, and, an, approximately, matching, amount, of, caucasus, hunter, gatherer, ancestry, 4, 3, 1, on, average, though, some, of, the, mycenaeans, lacked, steppe, ancestry, altogether, individual, mycenaean, samples, from, mainland, greece, had, proportions, of, ehg, ancestry, ranging, from, 0, up, to, 19, 7, at, kastrouli, or, 12, 2, at, the, palace, of, nestor, another, mycenaean, individual, from, crete, dating, from, c, 1370, c, 1340, bc, crete, armenoi, had, 24, 6, ehg, ancestry, the, remaining, non, steppe, related, mycenaean, ancestry, was, similar, to, that, of, the, minoans, and, the, early, bronze, age, population, of, mainland, greece, and, elite, mycenaean, samples, from, the, palace, of, nestor, at, pylos, and, its, environs, did, not, differ, from, the, general, population, in, terms, of, their, average, ancestral, composition, according, to, lazaridis, et, al, these, results, strongly, support, the, hypothesis, that, mycenaeans, were, the, outcome, of, admixture, between, descendants, of, yamnaya, like, steppe, migrants, and, a, minoan, like, population, with, steppe, migrants, considered, to, be, indo, european, speakers, and, progenitors, of, the, greek, language, minoans, were, predominantly, of, early, european, farmer, ancestry, 74, 3, on, average, with, additional, caucasus, hunter, gatherer, ancestry, 18, 2, 1, 2, on, average, lazaridis, et, al, also, identified, levant, pre, pottery, neolithic, ancestry, in, some, minoan, and, mycenaean, individuals, in, a, comment, on, the, study, by, lazaridis, et, al, 2022, paul, heggarty, of, the, max, planck, institute, expressed, doubts, regarding, the, connection, between, the, small, contribution, in, mycenaean, greece, of, the, ancestral, mix, of, yamnaya, culture, and, the, steppe, as, the, earliest, original, source, of, indo, european, languages, a, study, by, skourtanioti, et, al, 2023, generated, genome, wide, data, from, 95, bronze, age, individuals, from, mainland, greece, and, the, aegean, which, was, analysed, in, the, context, of, all, previously, published, samples, from, the, region, mycenaean, late, bronze, age, individuals, were, found, to, deviate, from, early, bronze, age, individuals, in, the, direction, of, central, and, eastern, european, bronze, age, populations, due, to, having, western, steppe, related, ancestry, not, found, in, the, earlier, samples, the, potential, source, of, this, ancestry, included, related, groups, from, serbia, early, bronze, age, croatia, middle, bronze, age, italy, early, and, middle, bronze, age, western, steppe, eneolithic, bronze, age, and, germany, corded, ware, the, latter, two, were, found, to, be, the, most, adequate, sources, but, at, the, moment, it, is, not, possible, to, more, closely, identify, the, region, s, from, where, this, genetic, affinity, was, derived, using, germany, corded, ware, as, a, source, proxy, it, was, estimated, that, mycenaeans, from, the, southern, greek, mainland, had, 22, 3, steppe, related, ancestry, on, average, whereas, late, bronze, age, individuals, from, nearby, islands, and, the, cyclades, had, slightly, lower, amounts, of, this, ancestry, and, one, individual, from, the, island, of, salamis, had, none, in, crete, samples, dating, from, the, 17th, to, the, 16th, centuries, bc, had, minimal, or, no, such, steppe, related, ancestry, whereas, later, samples, dating, from, c, 1300, bc, varied, from, 0, to, approximately, 40, steppe, related, ancestry, this, influx, of, steppe, related, ancestry, was, related, to, mycenaean, domination, of, the, island, from, the, 15th, century, bc, onwards, and, was, possibly, also, due, in, part, to, later, migrations, from, more, distant, areas, such, as, italy
