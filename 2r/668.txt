psychology, is, defined, as, the, scientific, study, of, behavior, and, mental, processes, philosophical, interest, in, the, human, mind, and, behavior, dates, back, to, the, ancient, civilizations, of, egypt, persia, greece, china, and, india, psychology, as, a, field, of, experimental, study, began, in, 1854, in, leipzig, germany, when, gustav, fechner, created, the, first, theory, of, how, judgments, about, sensory, experiences, are, made, and, how, to, experiment, on, them, fechner, s, theory, recognized, today, as, signal, detection, theory, foreshadowed, the, development, of, statistical, theories, of, comparative, judgment, and, thousands, of, experiments, based, on, his, ideas, link, s, w, psychological, science, 1995, in, 1879, wilhelm, wundt, founded, the, first, psychological, laboratory, dedicated, exclusively, to, psychological, research, in, leipzig, germany, wundt, was, also, the, first, person, to, refer, to, himself, as, a, psychologist, a, notable, precursor, to, wundt, was, ferdinand, ueberwasser, 1752, 1812, who, designated, himself, professor, of, empirical, psychology, and, logic, in, 1783, and, gave, lectures, on, empirical, psychology, at, the, old, university, of, m, nster, germany, other, important, early, contributors, to, the, field, include, hermann, ebbinghaus, a, pioneer, in, the, study, of, memory, william, james, the, american, father, of, pragmatism, and, ivan, pavlov, who, developed, the, procedures, associated, with, classical, conditioning, soon, after, the, development, of, experimental, psychology, various, kinds, of, applied, psychology, appeared, g, stanley, hall, brought, scientific, pedagogy, to, the, united, states, from, germany, in, the, early, 1880s, john, dewey, s, educational, theory, of, the, 1890s, was, another, example, also, in, the, 1890s, hugo, m, nsterberg, began, writing, about, the, application, of, psychology, to, industry, law, and, other, fields, lightner, witmer, established, the, first, psychological, clinic, in, the, 1890s, james, mckeen, cattell, adapted, francis, galton, s, anthropometric, methods, to, generate, the, first, program, of, mental, testing, in, the, 1890s, in, vienna, meanwhile, sigmund, freud, independently, developed, an, approach, to, the, study, of, the, mind, called, psychoanalysis, which, became, a, highly, influential, theory, in, psychology, the, 20th, century, saw, a, reaction, to, edward, titchener, s, critique, of, wundt, s, empiricism, this, contributed, to, the, formulation, of, behaviorism, by, john, b, watson, which, was, popularized, by, b, f, skinner, through, operant, conditioning, behaviorism, proposed, emphasizing, the, study, of, overt, behavior, due, to, the, fact, that, it, could, be, quantified, and, easily, measured, early, behaviorists, considered, the, study, of, the, mind, too, vague, for, productive, scientific, study, however, skinner, and, his, colleagues, did, study, thinking, as, a, form, of, covert, behavior, to, which, they, could, apply, the, same, principles, as, overt, behavior, the, final, decades, of, the, 20th, century, saw, the, rise, of, cognitive, science, an, interdisciplinary, approach, to, studying, the, human, mind, cognitive, science, again, considers, the, mind, as, a, subject, for, investigation, using, the, tools, of, cognitive, psychology, linguistics, computer, science, philosophy, behaviorism, and, neurobiology, this, form, of, investigation, has, proposed, that, a, wide, understanding, of, the, human, mind, is, possible, and, that, such, an, understanding, may, be, applied, to, other, research, domains, such, as, artificial, intelligence, there, are, conceptual, divisions, of, psychology, in, forces, or, waves, based, on, its, schools, and, historical, trends, this, terminology, was, popularized, among, the, psychologists, to, differentiate, a, growing, humanism, in, therapeutic, practice, from, the, 1930s, onwards, called, the, third, force, in, response, to, the, deterministic, tendencies, of, watson, s, behaviourism, and, freud, s, psychoanalysis, proponents, of, humanistic, psychology, included, carl, rogers, abraham, maslow, gordon, allport, erich, fromm, and, rollo, may, their, humanistic, concepts, are, also, related, to, existential, psychology, viktor, frankl, s, logotherapy, positive, psychology, which, has, martin, seligman, as, one, of, the, leading, proponents, c, r, cloninger, s, approach, to, well, being, and, character, development, as, well, as, to, transpersonal, psychology, incorporating, such, concepts, as, spirituality, self, transcendence, self, realization, self, actualization, and, mindfulness, in, cognitive, behavioral, psychotherapy, similar, terms, have, also, been, incorporated, by, which, first, wave, is, considered, the, initial, behavioral, therapy, a, second, wave, albert, ellis, s, cognitive, therapy, and, a, third, wave, with, the, acceptance, and, commitment, therapy, which, emphasizes, one, s, pursuit, of, values, methods, of, self, awareness, acceptance, and, psychological, flexibility, instead, of, challenging, negative, thought, schemes, a, fourth, wave, would, be, the, one, that, incorporates, transpersonal, concepts, and, positive, flourishing, in, a, way, criticized, by, some, researchers, for, its, heterogeneity, and, theoretical, direction, dependent, on, the, therapist, s, view, a, fifth, wave, has, now, been, proposed, by, a, group, of, researchers, seeking, to, integrate, earlier, concepts, into, a, unifying, theory, many, cultures, throughout, history, have, speculated, on, the, nature, of, the, mind, heart, soul, spirit, brain, etc, for, instance, in, ancient, egypt, the, edwin, smith, papyrus, contains, an, early, description, of, the, brain, and, some, speculations, on, its, functions, described, in, a, medical, surgical, context, and, the, descriptions, could, be, related, to, imhotep, who, was, the, first, egyptian, physician, who, anatomized, and, discovered, the, body, of, the, human, being, though, other, medical, documents, of, ancient, times, were, full, of, incantations, and, applications, meant, to, turn, away, disease, causing, demons, and, other, superstition, the, edwin, smith, papyrus, gives, remedies, to, almost, 50, conditions, and, only, two, contain, incantations, to, ward, off, evil, ancient, greek, philosophers, from, thales, fl, 550, bc, through, even, to, the, roman, period, developed, an, elaborate, theory, of, what, they, termed, the, psuch, psyche, from, which, the, first, half, of, psychology, is, derived, as, well, as, other, psychological, terms, nous, thumos, logistikon, etc, classical, greece, fifth, century, bc, philosophers, taught, naturalism, the, belief, that, laws, of, nature, shape, our, world, as, opposed, to, gods, and, demons, determining, human, fate, alcmaeon, for, example, believed, the, brain, not, the, heart, was, the, organ, of, thought, he, tracked, the, ascending, sensory, nerves, from, the, body, to, the, brain, theorizing, that, mental, activity, originated, in, the, region, where, the, central, nervous, system, is, located, and, that, the, cause, of, mental, illness, resided, within, the, brain, he, applied, this, understanding, to, classify, mental, diseases, and, treatments, one, of, the, most, influential, ancient, greek, influences, on, psychology, came, from, the, accounts, of, plato, especially, in, the, republic, pythagoras, and, of, aristotle, esp, peri, psyches, also, known, by, its, latin, title, de, anima, plato, s, tripartite, theory, of, the, soul, chariot, allegory, and, concepts, such, as, eros, defined, the, subsequent, western, philosophy, views, of, the, psyche, and, anticipated, modern, psychological, proposals, for, example, concepts, such, as, id, ego, super, ego, and, libido, were, interpreted, by, psychoanalysts, as, having, been, anticipated, by, plato, to, the, extent, that, in, 1920, freud, decided, to, present, plato, as, the, precursor, of, his, own, theory, as, part, of, a, strategy, directed, to, define, the, scientific, and, cultural, collocation, of, psychoanalysis, other, hellenistic, philosophers, namely, the, stoics, and, epicurians, diverged, from, the, classical, greek, tradition, in, several, important, ways, especially, in, their, concern, with, questions, of, the, physiological, basis, of, the, mind, the, roman, physician, galen, addressed, these, issues, most, elaborately, and, influentially, of, all, the, greek, tradition, influenced, some, christian, and, islamic, thought, on, the, topic, in, the, judeo, christian, tradition, the, manual, of, discipline, from, the, dead, sea, scrolls, c, 21, bc, 61, ad, notes, the, division, of, human, nature, into,

compatible, with, neurodynamics, in, a, 2008, article, in, the, journal, mind, and, matter, entitled, nonlinear, brain, dynamics, and, intention, according, to, aquinas, in, asia, china, had, a, long,

between, 194, and, 196, aphorisms, called, the, yoga, sutras, of, patanjali, he, developed, modern, yoga, for, psychological, resilience, and, balance, he, is, reputed, to, have, used, yoga, therapeutically, for, anxiety, depression, and, mental, disorders, as, common, then, as, now, buddhist, philosophies, have, developed, several, psychological, theories, see, buddhism, and, psychology, formulating, interpretations, of, the, mind, and, concepts, such, as, aggregates, skandhas, emptiness, sunyata, non, self, anatta, mindfulness, and, buddha, nature, which, are, addressed, today, by, theorists, of, humanistic, and, transpersonal, psychology, several, buddhist, lineages, have, developed, notions, analogous, to, those, of, modern, western, psychology, such, as, the, unconscious, personal, development, and, character, improvement, the, latter, being, part, of, the, noble, eightfold, path, and, expressed, for, example, in, the, tathagatagarbha, sutra, hinayana, traditions, such, as, the, theravada, focus, more, on, individual, meditation, while, mahayana, traditions, also, emphasize, the, attainment, of, a, buddha, nature, of, wisdom, praj, a, and, compassion, karu, in,

translators, in, the, house, of, wisdom, the, house, of, knowledge, and, other, such, institutions, in, the, islamic, golden, age, whose, glosses, and, commentaries, were, later, translated, into, latin, in, the, 12th, century, however, it, is, not, clear, how, these, sources, first, came, to, be, used, during, the, renaissance, and, their, influence, on, what, would, later, emerge, as, the, discipline, of, psychology, is, a, topic, of, scholarly, debate, the, first, print, use, of, the, term, psychology, that, is, greek, inspired, neo, latin, psychologia, is, dated, to, multiple, works, dated, 1525, etymology, has, long, been, attributed, to, the, german, scholastic, philosopher, rudolf, g, ckel, 1547, 1628, often, known, under, the, latin, form, rodolphus, goclenius, who, published, the, psychologia, hoc, est, de, hominis, perfectione, animo, et, imprimis, ortu, hujus, in, marburg, in, 1590, croatian, humanist, marko, maruli, 1450, 1524, likely, used, the, term, in, the, title, of, a, latin, treatise, entitled, psichiologia, de, ratione, animae, humanae, c, 1510, 1517, although, the, treatise, itself, has, not, been, preserved, its, title, appears, in, a, list, of, marulic, s, works, compiled, by, his, younger, contemporary, franjo, bozicevic, natalis, in, his, vita, marci, maruli, spalatensis, krsti, 1964, the, term, did, not, come, into, popular, usage, until, the, german, rationalist, philosopher, christian, wolff, 1679, 1754, used, it, in, his, works, psychologia, empirica, 1732, and, psychologia, rationalis, 1734, this, distinction, between, empirical, and, rational, psychology, was, picked, up, in, denis, diderot, s, 1713, 1780, and, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, s, 1717, 1783, encyclop, die, 1751, 1784, and, was, popularized, in, france, by, maine, de, biran, 1766, 1824, in, england, the, term, psychology, overtook, mental, philosophy, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, especially, in, the, work, of, william, hamilton, 1788, 1856, early, psychology, was, regarded, as, the, study, of, the, soul, in, the, christian, sense, of, the, term, the, modern, philosophical, form, of, psychology, was, heavily, influenced, by, the, works, of, ren, descartes, 1596, 1650, and, the, debates, that, he, generated, of, which, the, most, relevant, were, the, objections, to, his, meditations, on, first, philosophy, 1641, published, with, the, text, also, important, to, the, later, development, of, psychology, were, his, passions, of, the, soul, 1649, and, treatise, on, man, completed, in, 1632, but, along, with, the, rest, of, the, world, withheld, from, publication, after, descartes, heard, of, the, catholic, church, s, condemnation, of, galileo, it, was, eventually, published, posthumously, in, 1664, although, not, educated, as, a, physician, descartes, did, extensive, anatomical, studies, of, bulls, hearts, and, was, considered, important, enough, that, william, harvey, responded, to, him, descartes, was, one, of, the, first, to, endorse, harvey, s, model, of, the, circulation, of, the, blood, but, disagreed, with, his, metaphysical, framework, to, explain, it, descartes, dissected, animals, and, human, cadavers, and, as, a, result, was, familiar, with, the, research, on, the, flow, of, blood, leading, to, the, conclusion, that, the, body, is, a, complex, device, that, is, capable, of, moving, without, the, soul, thus, contradicting, the, doctrine, of, the, soul, the, emergence, of, psychology, as, a, medical, discipline, was, given, a, major, boost, by, thomas, willis, not, only, in, his, reference, to, psychology, the, doctrine, of, the, soul, in, terms, of, brain, function, but, through, his, detailed, 1672, anatomical, work, and, his, treatise, de, anima, brutorum, quae, hominis, vitalis, ac, sentitiva, est, exercitationes, duae, two, discourses, on, the, souls, of, brutes, meaning, beasts, however, willis, acknowledged, the, influence, of, descartes, s, rival, pierre, gassendi, as, an, inspiration, for, his, work, the, philosophers, of, the, british, empiricist, and, associationist, schools, had, a, profound, impact, on, the, later, course, of, experimental, psychology, john, locke, s, an, essay, concerning, human, understanding, 1689, george, berkeley, s, treatise, concerning, the, principles, of, human, knowledge, 1710, and, david, hume, s, a, treatise, of, human, nature, 1739, 1740, were, particularly, influential, as, were, david, hartley, s, observations, on, man, 1749, and, john, stuart, mill, s, a, system, of, logic, 1843, also, notable, was, the, work, of, some, continental, rationalist, philosophers, especially, baruch, spinoza, s, 1632, 1677, on, the, improvement, of, the, understanding, 1662, and, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, s, 1646, 1716, new, essays, on, human, understanding, completed, 1705, published, 1765, another, important, contribution, was, friedrich, august, rauch, s, 1806, 1841, book, psychology, or, a, view, of, the, human, soul, including, anthropology, 1840, the, first, english, exposition, of, hegelian, philosophy, for, an, american, audience, german, idealism, pioneered, the, proposition, of, the, unconscious, which, jung, considered, to, have, been, described, psychologically, for, the, first, time, by, physician, and, philosopher, carl, gustav, carus, also, notable, was, its, use, by, friedrich, wilhelm, joseph, von, schelling, 1775, 1835, and, by, eduard, von, hartmann, in, philosophy, of, the, unconscious, 1869, psychologist, hans, eysenck, writes, in, decline, and, fall, of, the, freudian, empire, 1985, that, hartmann, s, version, of, the, unconscious, is, very, similar, to, freud, s, the, danish, philosopher, s, ren, kierkegaard, also, influenced, the, humanistic, existential, and, modern, psychological, schools, with, his, works, the, concept, of, anxiety, 1844, and, the, sickness, unto, death, 1849, also, influential, on, the, emerging, discipline, of, psychology, were, debates, surrounding, the, efficacy, of, mesmerism, a, precursor, to, hypnosis, and, the, value, of, phrenology, the, former, was, developed, in, the, 1770s, by, austrian, physician, franz, mesmer, 1734, 1815, who, claimed, to, use, the, power, of, gravity, and, later, of, animal, magnetism, to, cure, various, physical, and, mental, ills, as, mesmer, and, his, treatment, became, increasingly, fashionable, in, both, vienna, and, paris, it, also, began, to, come, under, the, scrutiny, of, suspicious, officials, in, 1784, an, investigation, was, commissioned, in, paris, by, king, louis, xvi, which, included, american, ambassador, benjamin, franklin, chemist, antoine, lavoisier, and, physician, joseph, ignace, guillotin, later, the, popularizer, of, the, guillotine, they, concluded, that, mesmer, s, method, was, useless, abb, faria, an, indo, portuguese, priest, revived, public, attention, in, animal, magnetism, unlike, mesmer, faria, claimed, that, the, effect, was, generated, from, within, the, mind, by, the, power, of, expectancy, and, cooperation, of, the, patient, although, disputed, the, magnetic, tradition, continued, among, mesmer, s, students, and, others, resurfacing, in, england, in, the, 19th, century, in, the, work, of, the, physician, john, elliotson, 1791, 1868, and, the, surgeons, james, esdaile, 1808, 1859, and, james, braid, 1795, 1860, who, reconceptualized, it, as, property, of, the, subject, s, mind, rather, than, a, power, of, the, mesmerist, s, and, relabeled, it, hypnotism, mesmerism, also, continued, to, have, a, strong, social, if, not, medical, following, in, england, through, the, 19th, century, see, winter, 1998, faria, s, approach, was, significantly, extended, by, the, clinical, and, theoretical, work, of, ambroise, auguste, li, beault, and, hippolyte, bernheim, of, the, nancy, school, faria, s, theoretical, position, and, the, subsequent, experiences, of, those, in, the, nancy, school, made, significant, contributions, to, the, later, autosuggestion, techniques, of, mile, cou, it, was, adopted, for, the, treatment, of, hysteria, by, the, director, of, paris, s, salp, tri, re, hospital, jean, martin, charcot, 1825, 1893, phrenology, began, as, organology, a, theory, of, brain, structure, developed, by, the, german, physician, franz, joseph, gall, 1758, 1828, gall, argued, that, the, brain, is, divided, into, a, large, number, of, functional, organs, each, responsible, for, particular, human, mental, abilities, and, dispositions, hope, love, spirituality, greed, language, the, abilities, to, detect, the, size, form, and, color, of, objects, etc, he, argued, that, the, larger, each, of, these, organs, are, the, greater, the, power, of, the, corresponding, mental, trait, further, he, argued, that, one, could, detect, the, sizes, of, the, organs, in, a, given, individual, by, feeling, the, surface, of, that, person, s, skull, gall, s, ultra, localizationist, position, with, respect, to, the, brain, was, soon, attacked, most, notably, by, french, anatomist, pierre, flourens, 1794, 1867, who, conducted, ablation, studies, on, chickens, which, purported, to, demonstrate, little, or, no, cerebral, localization, of, function, although, gall, had, been, a, serious, if, misguided, researcher, his, theory, was, taken, by, his, assistant, johann, gaspar, spurzheim, 1776, 1832, and, developed, into, the, profitable, popular, enterprise, of, phrenology, which, soon, spawned, especially, in, britain, a, thriving, industry, of, independent, practitioners, in, the, hands, of, scottish, religious, leader, george, combe, 1788, 1858, whose, book, the, constitution, of, man, was, one, of, the, best, sellers, of, the, century, phrenology, became, strongly, associated, with, political, reform, movements, and, egalitarian, principles, see, e, g, shapin, 1975, but, also, see, van, wyhe, 2004, spurzheim, soon, spread, phrenology, to, america, as, well, where, itinerant, practical, phrenologists, assessed, the, mental, well, being, of, willing, customers, see, sokal, 2001, thompson, 2021, the, development, of, modern, psychology, was, closely, linked, to, psychiatry, in, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, see, history, of, psychiatry, when, the, treatment, of, the, mentally, ill, in, hospices, was, revolutionized, after, europeans, first, considered, their, pathological, conditions, in, fact, there, was, no, distinction, between, the, two, areas, in, psychotherapeutic, practice, in, an, era, when, there, was, still, no, drug, treatment, of, the, so, called, psychopharmacologicy, revolution, from, 1950, for, mental, disorders, and, its, early, theorists, and, pioneering, clinical, psychologists, generally, had, medical, background, the, first, to, implement, in, the, western, a, humanitarian, and, scientific, treatment, of, mental, health, based, on, enlightenment, ideas, were, the, french, alienists, who, developed, the, empirical, observation, of, psychopathology, describing, the, clinical, conditions, their, physiological, relationships, and, classifying, them, it, was, called, the, rationalist, empirical, school, which, most, known, exponents, were, pinel, esquirol, falret, morel, and, magnan, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, the, french, current, was, gradually, overcome, by, the, german, field, of, study, at, first, the, german, school, was, influenced, by, romantic, ideals, and, gave, rise, to, a, line, of, mental, process, speculators, based, more, on, empathy, than, reason, they, became, known, as, psychiker, mentalists, or, psychologists, with, different, currents, being, highlighted, by, reil, creator, of, the, word, psychiatry, heinroth, first, to, use, the, term, psychosomatic, ideler, and, carus, in, the, middle, of, the, century, a, somatic, reaction, somatiker, formed, against, the, speculative, doctrines, of, mentalism, and, it, was, based, on, neuroanatomy, and, neuropathology, in, it, those, who, made, important, contributions, to, the, psychopathological, classification, were, griesinger, westphal, krafft, ebbing, and, kahlbaum, which, in, their, turn, would, influence, wernicke, and, meynert, kraepelin, revolutionized, as, the, first, to, define, the, diagnostic, aspects, of, mental, disorders, in, syndromes, and, the, work, of, psychological, classification, was, followed, to, the, contemporary, field, by, contributions, from, schneider, kretschmer, leonhard, and, jaspers, in, great, britain, there, stand, out, in, the, nineteenth, century, alexander, bain, founder, of, the, first, journal, of, psychology, mind, and, writer, of, reference, books, on, the, subject, at, the, time, such, as, mental, science, the, compendium, of, psychology, and, the, history, of, philosophy, 1868, and, henry, maudsley, in, switzerland, bleuler, coined, the, terms, depth, psychology, schizophrenia, schizoid, and, autism, in, the, united, states, the, swiss, psychiatrist, adolf, meyer, maintained, that, the, patient, should, be, regarded, as, an, integrated, psychobiological, whole, emphasizing, psychosocial, factors, concepts, that, propitiated, the, so, called, psychosomatic, medicine, until, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, psychology, was, widely, regarded, as, a, branch, of, philosophy, whether, it, could, become, an, independent, scientific, discipline, was, questioned, already, earlier, on, immanuel, kant, 1724, 1804, declared, in, his, metaphysical, foundations, of, natural, science, 1786, that, psychology, might, perhaps, never, become, a, proper, natural, science, because, its, phenomena, cannot, be, quantified, among, other, reasons, kant, proposed, an, alternative, conception, of, an, empirical, investigation, of, human, thought, feeling, desire, and, action, and, lectured, on, these, topics, for, over, twenty, years, 1772, 73, 1795, 96, his, anthropology, from, a, pragmatic, point, of, view, 1798, which, resulted, from, these, lectures, looks, like, an, empirical, psychology, in, many, respects, johann, friedrich, herbart, 1776, 1841, took, issue, with, what, he, viewed, as, kant, s, conclusion, and, attempted, to, develop, a, mathematical, basis, for, a, scientific, psychology, although, he, was, unable, to, empirically, realize, the, terms, of, his, psychological, theory, his, efforts, did, lead, scientists, such, as, ernst, heinrich, weber, 1795, 1878, and, gustav, theodor, fechner, 1801, 1887, to, attempt, to, measure, the, mathematical, relationships, between, the, physical, magnitudes, of, external, stimuli, and, the, psychological, intensities, of, the, resulting, sensations, fechner, 1860, is, the, originator, of, the, term, psychophysics, meanwhile, individual, differences, in, reaction, time, had, become, a, critical, issue, in, the, field, of, astronomy, under, the, name, of, the, personal, equation, early, researches, by, friedrich, wilhelm, bessel, 1784, 1846, in, k, nigsberg, and, adolf, hirsch, led, to, the, development, of, a, highly, precise, chronoscope, by, matth, us, hipp, that, in, turn, was, based, on, a, design, by, charles, wheatstone, for, a, device, that, measured, the, speed, of, artillery, shells, edgell, symes, 1906, other, timing, instruments, were, borrowed, from, physiology, e, g, carl, ludwig, s, kymograph, and, adapted, for, use, by, the, utrecht, ophthalmologist, franciscus, donders, 1818, 1899, and, his, student, johan, jacob, de, jaager, in, measuring, the, duration, of, simple, mental, decisions, the, 19th, century, was, also, the, period, in, which, physiology, including, neurophysiology, professionalized, and, saw, some, of, its, most, significant, discoveries, among, its, leaders, were, charles, bell, 1774, 1843, and, fran, ois, magendie, 1783, 1855, who, independently, discovered, the, distinction, between, sensory, and, motor, nerves, in, the, spinal, column, johannes, m, ller, 1801, 1855, who, proposed, the, doctrine, of, specific, nerve, energies, emil, du, bois, reymond, 1818, 1896, who, studied, the, electrical, basis, of, muscle, contraction, pierre, paul, broca, 1824, 1880, and, carl, wernicke, 1848, 1905, who, identified, areas, of, the, brain, responsible, for, different, aspects, of, language, as, well, as, gustav, fritsch, 1837, 1927, eduard, hitzig, 1839, 1907, and, david, ferrier, 1843, 1924, who, localized, sensory, and, motor, areas, of, the, brain, one, of, the, principal, founders, of, experimental, physiology, hermann, helmholtz, 1821, 1894, conducted, studies, of, a, wide, range, of, topics, that, would, later, be, of, interest, to, psychologists, the, speed, of, neural, transmission, the, natures, of, sound, and, color, and, of, our, perceptions, of, them, etc, in, the, 1860s, while, he, held, a, position, in, heidelberg, helmholtz, engaged, as, an, assistant, a, young, physician, named, wilhelm, wundt, wundt, employed, the, equipment, of, the, physiology, laboratory, chronoscope, kymograph, and, various, peripheral, devices, to, address, more, complicated, psychological, questions, than, had, until, then, been, investigated, experimentally, in, particular, he, was, interested, in, the, nature, of, apperception, the, point, at, which, a, perception, occupies, the, central, focus, of, conscious, awareness, in, 1864, wundt, took, up, a, professorship, in, z, rich, where, he, published, his, landmark, textbook, grundz, ge, der, physiologischen, psychologie, principles, of, physiological, psychology, 1874, moving, to, a, more, prestigious, professorship, in, leipzig, in, 1875, wundt, founded, a, laboratory, specifically, dedicated, to, original, research, in, experimental, psychology, in, 1879, the, first, laboratory, of, its, kind, in, the, world, in, 1883, he, launched, a, journal, in, which, to, publish, the, results, of, his, and, his, students, research, philosophische, studien, philosophical, studies, for, more, on, wundt, see, e, g, bringmann, tweney, 1980, rieber, robinson, 2001, wundt, attracted, a, large, number, of, students, not, only, from, germany, but, also, from, abroad, among, his, most, influential, american, students, were, g, stanley, hall, who, had, already, obtained, a, phd, from, harvard, under, the, supervision, of, william, james, james, mckeen, cattell, who, was, wundt, s, first, assistant, and, frank, angell, who, founded, laboratories, at, both, cornell, and, stanford, the, most, influential, british, student, was, edward, bradford, titchener, who, later, became, professor, at, cornell, experimental, psychology, laboratories, were, soon, also, established, at, berlin, by, carl, stumpf, 1848, 1936, and, at, g, ttingen, by, georg, elias, m, ller, 1850, 1934, another, major, german, experimental, psychologist, of, the, era, though, he, did, not, direct, his, own, research, institute, was, hermann, ebbinghaus, 1850, 1909, experimentation, was, not, the, only, approach, to, psychology, in, the, german, speaking, world, at, this, time, starting, in, the, 1890s, employing, the, case, study, technique, the, viennese, physician, sigmund, freud, developed, and, applied, the, methods, of, hypnosis, free, association, and, dream, interpretation, to, reveal, putatively, unconscious, beliefs, and, desires, that, he, argued, were, the, underlying, causes, of, his, patients, hysteria, he, dubbed, this, approach, psychoanalysis, freudian, psychoanalysis, is, particularly, notable, for, the, emphasis, it, places, on, the, course, of, an, individual, s, sexual, development, in, pathogenesis, psychoanalytic, concepts, have, had, a, strong, and, lasting, influence, on, western, culture, particularly, on, the, arts, although, its, scientific, contribution, is, still, a, matter, of, debate, both, freudian, and, jungian, psychology, revealed, the, existence, of, compartmentalized, thinking, in, which, some, behavior, and, thoughts, are, hidden, from, consciousness, yet, operative, as, part, of, the, complete, personality, hidden, agendas, a, bad, conscience, or, a, sense, of, guilt, are, examples, of, the, existence, of, mental, processes, in, which, the, individual, is, not, conscious, through, choice, or, lack, of, understanding, of, some, aspects, of, their, personality, and, subsequent, behavior, psychoanalysis, examines, mental, processes, which, affect, the, ego, an, understanding, of, these, theoretically, allows, the, individual, greater, choice, and, consciousness, with, a, healing, effect, in, neurosis, and, occasionally, in, psychosis, both, of, which, richard, von, krafft, ebing, defined, as, diseases, of, the, personality, freud, founded, the, international, psychoanalytic, association, in, 1910, inspired, also, by, ferenczi, main, theoretical, successors, were, anna, freud, his, daughter, and, melane, klein, particularly, in, child, psychoanalysis, both, inaugurating, competing, concepts, in, addition, to, those, who, became, dissidents, and, developed, interpretations, different, from, freud, s, psychoanalytic, one, thus, called, by, some, neo, freudians, or, more, correctly, post, freudians, the, most, known, are, alfred, adler, individual, psychology, carl, gustav, jung, analytical, psychology, otto, rank, karen, horney, erik, erikson, and, erich, fromm, jung, was, an, associate, of, freud, s, who, later, broke, with, him, over, freud, s, emphasis, on, sexuality, working, with, concepts, of, the, unconscious, first, noted, during, the, 1800s, by, john, stuart, mill, krafft, ebing, pierre, janet, th, odore, flournoy, and, others, jung, defined, four, mental, functions, which, relate, to, and, define, the, ego, the, conscious, self, jung, insisted, on, an, empirical, psychology, on, which, theories, must, be, based, on, facts, and, not, on, the, psychologist, s, projections, or, expectations, around, 1875, the, harvard, physiology, instructor, as, he, then, was, william, james, opened, a, small, experimental, psychology, demonstration, laboratory, for, use, with, his, courses, the, laboratory, was, never, used, at, that, time, for, original, research, and, so, controversy, remains, as, to, whether, it, is, to, be, regarded, as, the, first, experimental, psychology, laboratory, or, not, in, 1878, james, gave, a, series, of, lectures, at, johns, hopkins, university, entitled, the, senses, and, the, brain, and, their, relation, to, thought, in, which, he, argued, contra, thomas, henry, huxley, that, consciousness, is, not, epiphenomenal, but, must, have, an, evolutionary, function, or, it, would, not, have, been, naturally, selected, in, humans, the, same, year, james, was, contracted, by, henry, holt, to, write, a, textbook, on, the, new, experimental, psychology, if, he, had, written, it, quickly, it, would, have, been, the, first, english, language, textbook, on, the, topic, it, was, twelve, years, however, before, his, two, volume, the, principles, of, psychology, would, be, published, in, the, meantime, textbooks, were, published, by, george, trumbull, ladd, of, yale, 1887, and, james, mark, baldwin, then, of, lake, forest, college, 1889, william, james, was, one, of, the, founders, of, the, american, society, for, psychical, research, in, 1885, which, studied, psychic, phenomena, parapsychology, before, the, creation, of, the, american, psychological, association, in, 1892, james, was, also, president, of, the, british, society, that, inspired, the, united, states, one, the, society, for, psychical, research, founded, in, 1882, which, investigated, psychology, and, the, paranormal, on, topics, such, as, mediumship, dissociation, telepathy, and, hypnosis, and, it, innovated, research, in, psychology, by, which, according, to, science, historian, andreas, sommer, were, devised, methodological, innovations, such, as, randomized, study, designs, and, conducted, the, first, experiments, investigating, the, psychology, of, eyewitness, testimony, hodgson, and, davey, 1887, empirical, and, conceptual, studies, illuminating, mechanisms, of, dissociation, and, hypnotism, its, members, also, initiated, and, organised, the, international, congresses, of, physiological, experimental, psychology, in, 1879, charles, sanders, peirce, was, hired, as, a, philosophy, instructor, at, johns, hopkins, university, although, better, known, for, his, astronomical, and, philosophical, work, peirce, also, conducted, what, are, perhaps, the, first, american, psychology, experiments, on, the, subject, of, color, vision, published, in, 1877, in, the, american, journal, of, science, see, cadwallader, 1974, peirce, and, his, student, joseph, jastrow, published, on, small, differences, in, sensation, in, the, memoirs, of, the, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1884, in, 1882, peirce, was, joined, at, johns, hopkins, by, g, stanley, hall, who, opened, the, first, american, research, laboratory, devoted, to, experimental, psychology, in, 1883, peirce, was, forced, out, of, his, position, by, scandal, and, hall, was, awarded, the, only, professorship, in, philosophy, at, johns, hopkins, in, 1887, hall, founded, the, american, journal, of, psychology, which, published, work, primarily, emanating, from, his, own, laboratory, in, 1888, hall, left, his, johns, hopkins, professorship, for, the, presidency, of, the, newly, founded, clark, university, where, he, remained, for, the, rest, of, his, career, soon, experimental, psychology, laboratories, were, opened, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, in, 1887, by, james, mckeen, cattell, indiana, university, 1888, william, lowe, bryan, the, university, of, wisconsin, 1888, joseph, jastrow, clark, university, 1889, edmund, sanford, the, mclean, asylum, 1889, william, noyes, and, the, university, of, nebraska, 1889, harry, kirke, wolfe, however, it, was, princeton, university, s, eno, hall, built, in, 1924, that, became, the, first, university, building, in, the, united, states, to, be, devoted, entirely, to, experimental, psychology, when, it, became, the, home, of, the, university, s, department, of, psychology, in, 1890, william, james, the, principles, of, psychology, finally, appeared, and, rapidly, became, the, most, influential, textbook, in, the, history, of, american, psychology, it, laid, many, of, the, foundations, for, the, sorts, of, questions, that, american, psychologists, would, focus, on, for, years, to, come, the, book, s, chapters, on, consciousness, emotion, and, habit, were, particularly, agenda, setting, one, of, those, who, felt, the, impact, of, james, principles, was, john, dewey, then, professor, of, philosophy, at, the, university, of, michigan, with, his, junior, colleagues, james, hayden, tufts, who, founded, the, psychology, laboratory, at, michigan, and, george, herbert, mead, and, his, student, james, rowland, angell, this, group, began, to, reformulate, psychology, focusing, more, strongly, on, the, social, environment, and, on, the, activity, of, mind, and, behavior, than, the, psychophysics, inspired, physiological, psychology, of, wundt, and, his, followers, had, heretofore, tufts, left, michigan, for, another, junior, position, at, the, newly, founded, university, of, chicago, in, 1892, a, year, later, the, senior, philosopher, at, chicago, charles, strong, resigned, and, tufts, recommended, to, chicago, president, william, rainey, harper, that, dewey, be, offered, the, position, after, initial, reluctance, dewey, was, hired, in, 1894, dewey, soon, filled, out, the, department, with, his, michigan, companions, mead, and, angell, these, four, formed, the, core, of, the, chicago, school, of, psychology, in, 1892, g, stanley, hall, invited, 30, some, psychologists, and, philosophers, to, a, meeting, at, clark, with, the, purpose, of, founding, a, new, american, psychological, association, apa, on, the, history, of, the, apa, see, evans, staudt, sexton, cadwallader, 1992, the, first, annual, meeting, of, the, apa, was, held, later, that, year, hosted, by, george, stuart, fullerton, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, almost, immediately, tension, arose, between, the, experimentally, and, philosophically, inclined, members, of, the, apa, edward, bradford, titchener, and, lightner, witmer, launched, an, attempt, to, either, establish, a, separate, section, for, philosophical, presentations, or, to, eject, the, philosophers, altogether, after, nearly, a, decade, of, debate, a, western, philosophical, association, was, founded, and, held, its, first, meeting, in, 1901, at, the, university, of, nebraska, the, following, year, 1902, an, american, philosophical, association, held, its, first, meeting, at, columbia, university, these, ultimately, became, the, central, and, eastern, divisions, of, the, modern, american, philosophical, association, in, 1894, a, number, of, psychologists, unhappy, with, the, parochial, editorial, policies, of, the, american, journal, of, psychology, approached, hall, about, appointing, an, editorial, board, and, opening, the, journal, out, to, more, psychologists, not, within, hall, s, immediate, circle, hall, refused, so, james, mckeen, cattell, then, of, columbia, and, james, mark, baldwin, then, of, princeton, co, founded, a, new, journal, psychological, review, which, rapidly, grew, to, become, a, major, outlet, for, american, psychological, researchers, beginning, in, 1895, james, mark, baldwin, princeton, hopkins, and, edward, bradford, titchener, cornell, entered, into, an, increasingly, acrimonious, dispute, over, the, correct, interpretation, of, some, anomalous, reaction, time, findings, that, had, come, from, the, wundt, laboratory, originally, reported, by, ludwig, lange, and, james, mckeen, cattell, in, 1896, james, rowland, angell, and, addison, w, moore, chicago, published, a, series, of, experiments, in, psychological, review, appearing, to, show, that, baldwin, was, the, more, correct, of, the, two, however, they, interpreted, their, findings, in, light, of, john, dewey, s, new, approach, to, psychology, which, rejected, the, traditional, stimulus, response, understanding, of, the, reflex, arc, in, favor, of, a, circular, account, in, which, what, serves, as, stimulus, and, what, as, response, depends, on, how, one, views, the, situation, the, full, position, was, laid, out, in, dewey, s, landmark, article, the, reflex, arc, concept, in, psychology, which, also, appeared, in, psychological, review, in, 1896, titchener, responded, in, philosophical, review, 1898, 1899, by, distinguishing, his, austere, structural, approach, to, psychology, from, what, he, termed, the, chicago, group, s, more, applied, functional, approach, and, thus, began, the, first, major, theoretical, rift, in, american, psychology, between, structuralism, and, functionalism, the, group, at, columbia, led, by, james, mckeen, cattell, edward, l, thorndike, and, robert, s, woodworth, was, often, regarded, as, a, second, after, chicago, school, of, american, functionalism, see, e, g, heidbredder, 1933, although, they, never, used, that, term, themselves, because, their, research, focused, on, the, applied, areas, of, mental, testing, learning, and, education, dewey, was, elected, president, of, the, apa, in, 1899, while, titchener, dropped, his, membership, in, the, association, in, 1904, titchener, formed, his, own, group, eventually, known, as, the, society, of, experimental, psychologists, jastrow, promoted, the, functionalist, approach, in, his, apa, presidential, address, of, 1900, and, angell, adopted, titchener, s, label, explicitly, in, his, influential, textbook, of, 1904, and, his, apa, presidential, address, of, 1906, in, reality, structuralism, was, more, or, less, confined, to, titchener, and, his, students, it, was, titchener, s, former, student, e, g, boring, writing, a, history, of, experimental, psychology, who, launched, the, common, idea, that, the, structuralism, functionalism, debate, was, the, primary, fault, line, in, american, psychology, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, functionalism, broadly, speaking, with, its, more, practical, emphasis, on, action, and, application, better, suited, the, american, cultural, style, and, perhaps, more, important, was, more, appealing, to, pragmatic, university, trustees, and, private, funding, agencies, jules, baillarger, founded, the, soci, t, m, dico, psychologique, in, 1847, one, of, the, first, associations, of, its, kind, and, which, published, the, annales, medico, psychologiques, france, already, had, a, pioneering, tradition, in, psychological, study, and, it, was, relevant, the, publication, of, pr, cis, d, un, cours, de, psychologie, summary, of, a, psychology, course, in, 1831, by, adolphe, garnier, who, also, published, the, trait, des, facult, s, de, l, me, comprenant, l, histoire, des, principales, th, ories, psychologiques, treatise, of, the, faculties, of, the, soul, comprising, the, history, of, major, psychological, theories, in, 1852, garnier, was, called, the, best, monument, of, psychological, science, of, our, time, by, revue, des, deux, mondes, in, 1864, in, no, small, measure, because, of, the, conservatism, of, the, reign, of, louis, napol, on, president, 1848, 1852, emperor, as, napol, on, iii, 1852, 1870, academic, philosophy, in, france, through, the, middle, part, of, the, 19th, century, was, controlled, by, members, of, the, eclectic, and, spiritualist, schools, led, by, figures, such, as, victor, cousin, 1792, 1867, th, dodore, jouffroy, 1796, 1842, and, paul, janet, 1823, 1899, these, were, traditional, metaphysical, schools, opposed, to, regarding, psychology, as, a, natural, science, with, the, ouster, of, napol, on, iii, after, the, d, bacle, of, the, franco, prussian, war, new, paths, both, political, and, intellectual, became, possible, from, the, 1870, forward, a, steadily, increasing, interest, in, positivist, materialist, evolutionary, and, deterministic, approaches, to, psychology, developed, influenced, by, among, others, the, work, of, hyppolyte, taine, 1828, 1893, e, g, de, l, intelligence, 1870, and, th, odule, ribot, 1839, 1916, e, g, la, psychologie, anglaise, contemporaine, 1870, in, 1876, ribot, founded,

although, not, a, working, experimentalist, himself, ribot, s, many, books, were, to, have, profound, influence, on, the, next, generation, of, psychologists, these, included, especially, his, l, h,

will, 1883, and, personality, 1885, and, where, he, attempted, to, bring, to, these, topics, the, insights, of, general, psychology, although, in, 1881, he, lost, a, sorbonne, professorship, in, the, history, of, psychological, doctrines, to, traditionalist, jules, soury, 1842, 1915, from, 1885, to, 1889, he, taught, experimental, psychology, at, the, sorbonne, in, 1889, he, was, awarded, a,

the, 1908, edition, which, appeared, in, book, form, the, translated, test, was, used, by, goddard, to, advance, his, eugenics, agenda, with, respect, to, those, he, deemed, congenitally, feeble, minded, especially, immigrants, from, non, western, european, countries, binet, s, test, was, revised, by, stanford, professor, lewis, m, terman, 1877, 1956, into, the, stanford, binet, iq, test, in, 1916, with, binet, s, death, in, 1911, the, sorbonne, laboratory, and, l, ann, e, psychologique, fell, to, henri, pi, ron, 1881, 1964, pi, ron, s, orientation, was, more, physiological, that, binet, s, had, been, pierre, janet, became, the, leading, psychiatrist, in, france, being, appointed, to, the, salp, tri, re, 1890, 1894, the, sorbonne, 1895, 1920, and, the, coll, ge, de, france, 1902, 1936, in, 1904, he, co, founded, the, journale, de, psychologie, normale, et, pathologique, with, fellow, sorbonne, professor, georges, dumas, 1866, 1946, a, student, and, faithful, follower, of, ribot, whereas, janet, s, teacher, charcot, had, focused, on, the, neurological, bases, of, hysteria, janet, was, concerned, to, develop, a, scientific, approach, to, psychopathology, as, a, mental, disorder, his, theory, that, mental, pathology, results, from, conflict, between, unconscious, and, conscious, parts, of, the, mind, and, that, unconscious, mental, contents, may, emerge, as, symptoms, with, symbolic, meanings, led, to, a, public, priority, dispute, with, sigmund, freud, although, the, british, had, the, first, scholarly, journal, dedicated, to, the, topic, of, psychology, mind, founded, in, 1876, by, alexander, bain, and, edited, by, george, croom, robertson, it, was, quite, a, long, while, before, experimental, psychology, developed, there, to, challenge, the, strong, tradition, of, mental, philosophy, the, experimental, reports, that, appeared, in, mind, in, the, first, two, decades, of, its, existence, were, almost, entirely, authored, by, americans, especially, g, stanley, hall, and, his, students, notably, henry, herbert, donaldson, and, james, mckeen, cattell, francis, galton, s, 1822, 1911, anthropometric, laboratory, opened, in, 1884, there, people, were, tested, on, a, wide, variety, of, physical, e, g, strength, of, blow, and, perceptual, e, g, visual, acuity, attributes, in, 1886, galton, was, visited, by, james, mckeen, cattell, who, would, later, adapt, galton, s, techniques, in, developing, his, own, mental, testing, research, program, in, the, united, states, galton, was, not, primarily, a, psychologist, however, the, data, he, accumulated, in, the, anthropometric, laboratory, primarily, went, toward, supporting, his, case, for, eugenics, to, help, interpret, the, mounds, of, data, he, accumulated, galton, developed, a, number, of, important, statistical, techniques, including, the, precursors, to, the, scatterplot, and, the, product, moment, correlation, coefficient, later, perfected, by, karl, pearson, 1857, 1936, soon, after, charles, spearman, 1863, 1945, developed, the, correlation, based, statistical, procedure, of, factor, analysis, in, the, process, of, building, a, case, for, his, two, factor, theory, of, intelligence, published, in, 1901, spearman, believed, that, people, have, an, inborn, level, of, general, intelligence, or, g, which, can, be, crystallized, into, a, specific, skill, in, any, of, a, number, of, narrow, content, area, s, or, specific, intelligence, laboratory, psychology, of, the, kind, practiced, in, germany, and, the, united, states, was, slow, in, coming, to, britain, although, the, philosopher, james, ward, 1843, 1925, urged, cambridge, university, to, establish, a, psychophysics, laboratory, from, the, mid, 1870s, forward, it, was, not, until, the, 1891, that, they, put, so, much, as, 50, toward, some, basic, apparatus, bartlett, 1937, a, laboratory, was, established, through, the, assistance, of, the, physiology, department, in, 1897, and, a, lectureship, in, psychology, was, established, which, first, went, to, w, h, r, rivers, 1864, 1922, soon, rivers, was, joined, by, c, s, myers, 1873, 1946, and, william, mcdougall, 1871, 1938, this, group, showed, as, much, interest, in, anthropology, as, psychology, going, with, alfred, cort, haddon, 1855, 1940, on, the, famed, torres, straits, expedition, of, 1898, in, 1901, the, psychological, society, was, established, which, renamed, itself, the, british, psychological, society, in, 1906, and, in, 1904, ward, and, rivers, co, founded, the, british, journal, of, psychology, insofar, as, psychology, was, regarded, as, the, science, of, the, soul, and, institutionally, part, of, philosophy, courses, in, theology, schools, psychology, was, present, in, russia, from, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, by, contrast, if, by, psychology, we, mean, a, separate, discipline, with, university, chairs, and, people, employed, as, psychologists, then, it, appeared, only, after, the, october, revolution, all, the, same, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, many, different, kinds, of, activities, called, psychology, had, spread, in, philosophy, natural, science, literature, medicine, education, legal, practice, and, even, military, science, psychology, was, as, much, a, cultural, resource, as, it, was, a, defined, area, of, scholarship, the, question, who, is, to, develop, psychology, and, how, was, of, such, importance, that, ivan, sechenov, a, physiologist, and, doctor, by, training, and, a, teacher, in, institutions, of, higher, education, chose, it, as, the, title, for, an, essay, in, 1873, his, question, was, rhetorical, for, he, was, already, convinced, that, physiology, was, the, scientific, basis, on, which, to, build, psychology, the, response, to, sechenov, s, popular, essay, included, one, in, 1872, 1873, from, a, liberal, professor, of, law, konstantin, kavelin, he, supported, a, psychology, drawing, on, ethnographic, materials, about, national, character, a, program, that, had, existed, since, 1847, when, the, ethnographic, division, of, the, recently, founded, russian, geographical, society, circulated, a, request, for, information, on, the, people, s, way, of, life, including, intellectual, and, moral, abilities, this, was, part, of, a, larger, debate, about, national, character, national, resources, and, national, development, in, the, context, of, which, a, prominent, linguist, alexander, potebnja, began, in, 1862, to, publish, studies, of, the, relation, between, mentality, and, language, although, it, was, the, history, and, philology, departments, that, traditionally, taught, courses, in, psychology, it, was, the, medical, schools, that, first, introduced, psychological, laboratories, and, courses, on, experimental, psychology, as, early, as, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, i, m, balinskii, 1827, 1902, at, the, military, surgical, academy, which, changed, its, name, in, the, 1880s, to, the, military, medical, academy, in, st, petersburg, and, sergey, korsakov, a, psychiatrist, at, moscow, university, began, to, purchase, psychometric, apparatus, vladimir, bekhterev, created, the, first, laboratory, a, special, space, for, psychological, experiments, in, kazan, in, 1885, at, a, meeting, of, the, moscow, psychological, society, in, 1887, the, psychiatrists, grigory, rossolimo, and, ardalion, tokarskii, 1859, 1901, demonstrated, both, wundt, s, experiments, and, hypnosis, in, 1895, tokarskii, set, up, a, psychological, laboratory, in, the, psychiatric, clinic, of, moscow, university, with, the, support, of, its, head, korsakov, to, teach, future, psychiatrists, about, what, he, promoted, as, new, and, necessary, techniques, in, january, 1884, the, philosophers, matvei, troitskii, and, iakov, grot, founded, the, moscow, psychological, society, they, wished, to, discuss, philosophical, issues, but, because, anything, called, philosophical, could, attract, official, disapproval, they, used, psychological, as, a, euphemism, in, 1907, georgy, chelpanov, announced, a, 3, year, course, in, psychology, based, on, laboratory, work, and, a, well, structured, teaching, seminar, in, the, following, years, chelpanov, traveled, in, europe, and, the, united, states, to, see, existing, institutes, the, result, was, a, luxurious, four, story, building, for, the, psychological, institute, of, moscow, with, well, equipped, laboratories, opening, formally, on, march, 23, 1914, in, 1896, one, of, wilhelm, wundt, s, former, leipzig, laboratory, assistants, oswald, k, lpe, 1862, 1915, founded, a, new, laboratory, in, w, rzburg, k, lpe, soon, surrounded, himself, with, a, number, of, younger, psychologists, the, so, called, w, rzburg, school, most, notably, narzi, ach, 1871, 1946, karl, b, hler, 1879, 1963, ernst, d, rr, 1878, 1913, karl, marbe, 1869, 1953, and, henry, jackson, watt, 1879, 1925, collectively, they, developed, a, new, approach, to, psychological, experimentation, that, flew, in, the, face, of, many, of, wundt, s, restrictions, wundt, had, drawn, a, distinction, between, the, old, philosophical, style, of, self, observation, selbstbeobachtung, in, which, one, introspected, for, extended, durations, on, higher, thought, processes, and, inner, perception, innere, wahrnehmung, in, which, one, could, be, immediately, aware, of, a, momentary, sensation, feeling, or, image, vorstellung, the, former, was, declared, to, be, impossible, by, wundt, who, argued, that, higher, thought, could, not, be, studied, experimentally, through, extended, introspection, but, only, humanistically, through, v, lkerpsychologie, folk, psychology, only, the, latter, was, a, proper, subject, for, experimentation, the, w, rzburgers, by, contrast, designed, experiments, in, which, the, experimental, subject, was, presented, with, a, complex, stimulus, for, example, a, nietzschean, aphorism, or, a, logical, problem, and, after, processing, it, for, a, time, for, example, interpreting, the, aphorism, or, solving, the, problem, retrospectively, reported, to, the, experimenter, all, that, had, passed, through, his, consciousness, during, the, interval, in, the, process, the, w, rzburgers, claimed, to, have, discovered, a, number, of, new, elements, of, consciousness, over, and, above, wundt, s, sensations, feelings, and, images, including, bewu, tseinslagen, conscious, sets, bewu, theiten, awarenesses, and, gedanken, thoughts, in, the, english, language, literature, these, are, often, collectively, termed, imageless, thoughts, and, the, debate, between, wundt, and, the, w, rzburgers, the, imageless, thought, controversy, wundt, referred, to, the, w, rzburgers, studies, as, sham, experiments, and, criticized, them, vigorously, wundt, s, most, significant, english, student, edward, bradford, titchener, then, working, at, cornell, intervened, in, the, dispute, claiming, to, have, conducted, extended, introspective, studies, in, which, he, was, able, to, resolve, the, w, rzburgers, imageless, thoughts, into, sensations, feelings, and, images, he, thus, paradoxically, used, a, method, of, which, wundt, did, not, approve, in, order, to, affirm, wundt, s, view, of, the, situation, the, imageless, thought, debate, is, often, said, to, have, been, instrumental, in, undermining, the, legitimacy, of, all, introspective, methods, in, experimental, psychology, and, ultimately, in, bringing, about, the, behaviorist, revolution, in, american, psychology, it, was, not, without, its, own, delayed, legacy, however, herbert, a, simon, 1981, cites, the, work, of, one, w, rzburg, psychologist, in, particular, otto, selz, 1881, 1943, for, having, inspired, him, to, develop, his, famous, problem, solving, computer, algorithms, such, as, logic, theorist, and, general, problem, solver, and, his, thinking, out, loud, method, for, protocol, analysis, in, addition, karl, popper, studied, psychology, under, b, hler, and, selz, in, the, 1920s, and, appears, to, have, brought, some, of, their, influence, unattributed, to, his, philosophy, of, science, whereas, the, w, rzburgers, debated, with, wundt, mainly, on, matters, of, method, another, german, movement, centered, in, berlin, took, issue, with, the, widespread, assumption, that, the, aim, of, psychology, should, be, to, break, consciousness, down, into, putative, basic, elements, instead, they, argued, that, the, psychological, whole, has, priority, and, that, the, parts, are, defined, by, the, structure, of, the, whole, rather, than, vice, versa, thus, the, school, was, named, gestalt, a, german, term, meaning, approximately, form, or, configuration, it, was, led, by, max, wertheimer, 1880, 1943, wolfgang, k, hler, 1887, 1967, and, kurt, koffka, 1886, 1941, wertheimer, had, been, a, student, of, austrian, philosopher, christian, von, ehrenfels, 1859, 1932, who, claimed, that, in, addition, to, the, sensory, elements, of, a, perceived, object, there, is, an, extra, element, which, though, in, some, sense, derived, from, the, organization, of, the, standard, sensory, elements, is, also, to, be, regarded, as, an, element, in, its, own, right, he, called, this, extra, element, gestalt, qualit, t, or, form, quality, for, instance, when, one, hears, a, melody, one, hears, the, notes, plus, something, in, addition, to, them, which, binds, them, together, into, a, tune, the, gestalt, qualit, t, it, is, the, presence, of, this, gestalt, qualit, t, which, according, to, ehrenfels, allows, a, tune, to, be, transposed, to, a, new, key, using, completely, different, notes, but, still, retain, its, identity, wertheimer, took, the, more, radical, line, that, what, is, given, me, by, the, melody, does, not, arise, as, a, secondary, process, from, the, sum, of, the, pieces, as, such, instead, what, takes, place, in, each, single, part, already, depends, upon, what, the, whole, is, 1925, 1938, in, other, words, one, hears, the, melody, first, and, only, then, may, perceptually, divide, it, up, into, notes, similarly, in, vision, one, sees, the, form, of, the, circle, first, it, is, given, im, mediately, i, e, its, apprehension, is, not, mediated, by, a, process, of, part, summation, only, after, this, primary, apprehension, might, one, notice, that, it, is, made, up, of, lines, or, dots, or, stars, gestalt, theorie, gestalt, psychology, was, officially, initiated, in, 1912, in, an, article, by, wertheimer, on, the, phi, phenomenon, a, perceptual, illusion, in, which, two, stationary, but, alternately, flashing, lights, appear, to, be, a, single, light, moving, from, one, location, to, another, contrary, to, popular, opinion, his, primary, target, was, not, behaviorism, as, it, was, not, yet, a, force, in, psychology, the, aim, of, his, criticism, was, rather, the, atomistic, psychologies, of, hermann, von, helmholtz, 1821, 1894, wilhelm, wundt, 1832, 1920, and, other, european, psychologists, of, the, time, the, two, men, who, served, as, wertheimer, s, subjects, in, the, phi, experiment, were, k, hler, and, koffka, k, hler, was, an, expert, in, physical, acoustics, having, studied, under, physicist, max, planck, 1858, 1947, but, had, taken, his, degree, in, psychology, under, carl, stumpf, 1848, 1936, koffka, was, also, a, student, of, stumpf, s, having, studied, movement, phenomena, and, psychological, aspects, of, rhythm, in, 1917, k, hler, 1917, 1925, published, the, results, of, four, years, of, research, on, learning, in, chimpanzees, k, hler, showed, contrary, to, the, claims, of, most, other, learning, theorists, that, animals, can, learn, by, sudden, insight, into, the, structure, of, a, problem, over, and, above, the, associative, and, incremental, manner, of, learning, that, ivan, pavlov, 1849, 1936, and, edward, lee, thorndike, 1874, 1949, had, demonstrated, with, dogs, and, cats, respectively, the, terms, structure, and, organization, were, focal, for, the, gestalt, psychologists, stimuli, were, said, to, have, a, certain, structure, to, be, organized, in, a, certain, way, and, that, it, is, to, this, structural, organization, rather, than, to, individual, sensory, elements, that, the, organism, responds, when, an, animal, is, conditioned, it, does, not, simply, respond, to, the, absolute, properties, of, a, stimulus, but, to, its, properties, relative, to, its, surroundings, to, use, a, favorite, example, of, k, hler, s, if, conditioned, to, respond, in, a, certain, way, to, the, lighter, of, two, gray, cards, the, animal, generalizes, the, relation, between, the, two, stimuli, rather, than, the, absolute, properties, of, the, conditioned, stimulus, it, will, respond, to, the, lighter, of, two, cards, in, subsequent, trials, even, if, the, darker, card, in, the, test, trial, is, of, the, same, intensity, as, the, lighter, one, in, the, original, training, trials, in, 1921, koffka, published, a, gestalt, oriented, text, on, developmental, psychology, growth, of, the, mind, with, the, help, of, american, psychologist, robert, ogden, koffka, introduced, the, gestalt, point, of, view, to, an, american, audience, in, 1922, by, way, of, a, paper, in, psychological, bulletin, it, contains, criticisms, of, then, current, explanations, of, a, number, of, problems, of, perception, and, the, alternatives, offered, by, the, gestalt, school, koffka, moved, to, the, united, states, in, 1924, eventually, settling, at, smith, college, in, 1927, in, 1935, koffka, published, his, principles, of, gestalt, psychology, this, textbook, laid, out, the, gestalt, vision, of, the, scientific, enterprise, as, a, whole, science, he, said, is, not, the, simple, accumulation, of, facts, what, makes, research, scientific, is, the, incorporation, of, facts, into, a, theoretical, structure, the, goal, of, the, gestalt, ists, was, to, integrate, the, facts, of, inanimate, nature, life, and, mind, into, a, single, scientific, structure, this, meant, that, science, would, have, to, swallow, not, only, what, koffka, called, the, quantitative, facts, of, physical, science, but, the, facts, of, two, other, scientific, categories, questions, of, order, and, questions, of, sinn, a, german, word, which, has, been, variously, translated, as, significance, value, and, meaning, without, incorporating, the, meaning, of, experience, and, behavior, koffka, believed, that, science, would, doom, itself, to, trivialities, in, its, investigation, of, human, beings, having, survived, the, onslaught, of, the, nazis, up, to, the, mid, 1930s, all, the, core, members, of, the, gestalt, movement, were, forced, out, of, germany, to, the, united, states, by, 1935, k, hler, published, another, book, dynamics, in, psychology, in, 1940, but, thereafter, the, gestalt, movement, suffered, a, series, of, setbacks, koffka, died, in, 1941, and, wertheimer, in, 1943, wertheimer, s, long, awaited, book, on, mathematical, problem, solving, productive, thinking, was, published, posthumously, in, 1945, but, k, hler, was, now, left, to, guide, the, movement, without, his, two, long, time, colleagues, as, a, result, of, the, conjunction, of, a, number, of, events, in, the, early, 20th, century, behaviorism, gradually, emerged, as, the, dominant, school, in, american, psychology, first, among, these, was, the, increasing, skepticism, with, which, many, viewed, the, concept, of, consciousness, although, still, considered, to, be, the, essential, element, separating, psychology, from, physiology, its, subjective, nature, and, the, unreliable, introspective, method, it, seemed, to, require, troubled, many, william, james, 1904, journal, of, philosophy, article, does, consciousness, exist, laid, out, the, worries, explicitly, second, was, the, gradual, rise, of, a, rigorous, animal, psychology, in, addition, to, edward, lee, thorndike, s, work, with, cats, in, puzzle, boxes, in, 1898, the, start, of, research, in, which, rats, learn, to, navigate, mazes, was, begun, by, willard, small, 1900, 1901, in, american, journal, of, psychology, robert, m, yerkes, s, 1905, journal, of, philosophy, article, animal, psychology, and, the, criteria, of, the, psychic, raised, the, general, question, of, when, one, is, entitled, to, attribute, consciousness, to, an, organism, the, following, few, years, saw, the, emergence, of, john, broadus, watson, 1878, 1959, as, a, major, player, publishing, his, dissertation, on, the, relation, between, neurological, development, and, learning, in, the, white, rat, 1907, psychological, review, monograph, supplement, carr, watson, 1908, j, comparative, neurology, psychology, another, important, rat, study, was, published, by, henry, h, donaldson, 1908, j, comparative, neurology, psychology, the, year, 1909, saw, the, first, english, language, account, of, ivan, pavlov, s, studies, of, conditioning, in, dogs, yerkes, morgulis, 1909, psychological, bulletin, a, third, factor, was, the, rise, of, watson, to, a, position, of, significant, power, within, the, psychological, community, in, 1908, watson, was, offered, a, junior, position, at, johns, hopkins, by, james, mark, baldwin, in, addition, to, heading, the, johns, hopkins, department, baldwin, was, the, editor, of, the, influential, journals, psychological, review, and, psychological, bulletin, only, months, after, watson, s, arrival, baldwin, was, forced, to, resign, his, professorship, due, to, scandal, watson, was, suddenly, made, head, of, the, department, and, editor, of, baldwin, s, journals, he, resolved, to, use, these, powerful, tools, to, revolutionize, psychology, in, the, image, of, his, own, research, in, 1913, he, published, in, psychological, review, the, article, that, is, often, called, the, manifesto, of, the, behaviorist, movement, psychology, as, the, behaviorist, views, it, there, he, argued, that, psychology, is, a, purely, objective, experimental, branch, of, natural, science, introspection, forms, no, essential, part, of, its, methods, and, the, behaviorist, recognizes, no, dividing, line, between, man, and, brute, the, following, year, 1914, his, first, textbook, behavior, went, to, press, although, behaviorism, took, some, time, to, be, accepted, as, a, comprehensive, approach, see, samelson, 1981, in, no, small, part, because, of, the, intervention, of, world, war, i, by, the, 1920s, watson, s, revolution, was, well, underway, the, central, tenet, of, early, behaviorism, was, that, psychology, should, be, a, science, of, behavior, not, of, the, mind, and, rejected, internal, mental, states, such, as, beliefs, desires, or, goals, watson, himself, however, was, forced, out, of, johns, hopkins, by, scandal, in, 1920, although, he, continued, to, publish, during, the, 1920s, he, eventually, moved, on, to, a, career, in, advertising, see, coon, 1994, among, the, behaviorists, who, continued, on, there, were, a, number, of, disagreements, about, the, best, way, to, proceed, neo, behaviorists, such, as, edward, c, tolman, edwin, guthrie, clark, l, hull, and, b, f, skinner, debated, issues, such, as, 1, whether, to, reformulate, the, traditional, psychological, vocabulary, in, behavioral, terms, or, discard, it, in, favor, of, a, wholly, new, scheme, 2, whether, learning, takes, place, all, at, once, or, gradually, 3, whether, biological, drives, should, be, included, in, the, new, science, in, order, to, provide, a, motivation, for, behavior, and, 4, to, what, degree, any, theoretical, framework, is, required, over, and, above, the, measured, effects, of, reinforcement, and, punishment, on, learning, by, the, late, 1950s, skinner, s, formulation, had, become, dominant, and, it, remains, a, part, of, the, modern, discipline, under, the, rubric, of, behavior, analysis, its, application, applied, behavior, analysis, has, become, one, of, the, most, useful, fields, of, psychology, behaviorism, was, the, ascendant, experimental, model, for, research, in, psychology, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, largely, due, to, the, creation, and, successful, application, not, least, of, which, in, advertising, of, conditioning, theories, as, scientific, models, of, human, behaviour, in, 1918, jean, piaget, 1896, 1980, turned, away, from, his, early, training, in, natural, history, and, began, post, doctoral, work, in, psychoanalysis, in, zurich, later, piaget, rejected, psychoanalysis, as, he, thought, it, was, insufficiently, empirical, in, 1919, he, moved, to, paris, to, work, at, the, binet, simon, lab, however, binet, had, died, in, 1911, and, simon, lived, and, worked, in, rouen, his, supervision, therefore, came, indirectly, from, pierre, janet, binet, s, old, rival, and, a, professor, at, the, coll, ge, de, france, the, job, in, paris, was, relatively, simple, to, use, the, statistical, techniques, he, had, learned, as, a, natural, historian, studying, molluscs, to, standardize, cyril, burt, s, intelligence, test, for, use, with, french, children, yet, without, direct, supervision, he, soon, found, a, remedy, to, this, boring, work, exploring, why, children, made, the, mistakes, they, did, applying, his, early, training, in, psychoanalytic, interviewing, piaget, began, to, intervene, directly, with, the, children, why, did, you, do, that, etc, it, was, from, this, that, the, ideas, formalized, in, his, later, stage, theory, first, emerged, in, 1921, piaget, moved, to, geneva, to, work, with, douard, clapar, de, at, the, rousseau, institute, they, formed, what, is, now, known, as, the, genevan, school, in, 1936, piaget, received, his, first, honorary, doctorate, from, harvard, in, 1955, the, international, center, for, genetic, epistemology, was, founded, an, interdisciplinary, collaboration, of, theoreticians, and, scientists, devoted, to, the, study, of, topics, related, to, piaget, s, theory, in, 1969, piaget, received, the, distinguished, scientific, contributions, award, from, the, american, psychological, association, in, the, early, twentieth, century, ivan, pavlov, s, behavioral, and, conditioning, experiments, became, the, most, internationally, recognized, russian, achievements, with, the, creation, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1922, marxism, was, introduced, as, an, overall, philosophical, and, methodological, framework, in, scientific, research, in, 1920s, state, ideology, promoted, a, tendency, to, the, psychology, of, bekhterev, s, reflexologist, reductionism, in, its, marxist, interpretation, and, to, historical, materialism, while, idealistic, philosophers, and, psychologists, were, harshly, criticized, another, variation, of, marxist, version, of, psychology, that, got, popularity, mostly, in, moscow, and, centered, in, the, local, institute, of, psychology, was, konstantin, kornilov, s, the, director, of, this, institute, reactology, that, became, the, main, view, besides, a, small, group, of, the, members, of, the, vygotsky, luria, circle, that, besides, its, namesakes, lev, vygotsky, and, alexander, luria, included, bluma, zeigarnik, alexei, leontiev, and, others, and, in, 1920s, embraced, a, deterministic, instrumental, psychology, version, of, cultural, historical, psychology, many, works, by, vygotsky, were, not, published, chronologically, because, of, soviet, censorship, but, primarily, because, of, vygotsky, s, failure, to, build, a, consistent, psychological, theory, of, consciousness, a, few, attempts, were, made, in, 1920s, at, formulating, the, core, of, theoretical, framework, of, the, genuinely, marxist, psychology, but, all, these, failed, and, were, characterized, in, early, 1930s, as, either, right, or, left, wing, deviations, of, reductionist, mechanicism, or, menshevising, idealism, it, was, sergei, rubinstein, in, mid, 1930s, who, formulated, the, key, principles, on, which, the, entire, soviet, variation, of, marxist, psychology, would, be, based, and, thus, become, the, genuine, pioneer, and, the, founder, of, this, psychological, discipline, in, the, marxist, disguise, in, the, soviet, union, in, late, 1940s, early, 1950s, lysenkoism, somewhat, affected, russian, psychology, yet, gave, it, a, considerable, impulse, for, a, reaction, and, unification, that, resulted, in, institutional, and, disciplinary, integration, of, psychological, community, in, the, postwar, soviet, union, noam, chomsky, s, 1959, review, of, skinner, s, book, verbal, behavior, which, aimed, to, explain, language, acquisition, in, a, behaviorist, framework, is, considered, one, of, the, major, theoretical, challenges, to, the, type, of, radical, as, in, root, behaviorism, that, skinner, taught, chomsky, claimed, that, language, could, not, be, learned, solely, from, the, sort, of, operant, conditioning, that, skinner, postulated, chomsky, argued, that, people, could, produce, an, infinite, variety, of, sentences, unique, in, structure, and, meaning, and, that, these, could, not, possibly, be, generated, solely, through, the, experience, of, natural, language, as, an, alternative, he, concluded, that, there, must, be, internal, mental, structures, states, of, mind, of, the, sort, that, behaviorism, rejected, as, illusory, the, issue, is, not, whether, mental, activities, exist, it, is, whether, they, can, be, shown, to, be, the, causes, of, behavior, similarly, the, work, by, albert, bandura, showed, that, children, could, learn, by, social, observation, without, any, change, in, overt, behaviour, and, so, must, according, to, him, be, accounted, for, by, internal, representations, the, rise, of, computer, technology, also, promoted, the, metaphor, of, mental, function, as, information, processing, this, combined, with, a, scientific, approach, to, studying, the, mind, as, well, as, a, belief, in, internal, mental, states, led, to, the, rise, of, cognitivism, as, the, dominant, model, of, the, mind, links, between, brain, and, nervous, system, function, were, also, becoming, common, partly, due, to, the, experimental, work, of, people, like, charles, sherrington, and, donald, hebb, and, partly, due, to, studies, of, people, with, brain, injury, see, cognitive, neuropsychology, with, the, development, of, technologies, for, accurately, measuring, brain, function, neuropsychology, and, cognitive, neuroscience, have, become, some, of, the, most, active, areas, in, contemporary, psychology, with, the, increasing, involvement, of, other, disciplines, such, as, philosophy, computer, science, and, neuroscience, in, the, quest, to, understand, the, mind, the, umbrella, discipline, of, cognitive, science, has, been, created, as, a, means, of, focusing, such, efforts, in, a, constructive, way, there, are, three, primary, journals, where, specialist, histories, of, psychology, are, published, in, addition, there, are, a, large, number, of, friendly, journals, where, historical, material, can, often, be, found, burman, j, t, 2018, what, is, history, of, psychology, network, analysis, of, journal, citation, reports, 2009, 2015, sage, open, 8, 1, 215824401876300,
