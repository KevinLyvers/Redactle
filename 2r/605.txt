most, prominent, structures, in, the, city, the, name, of, this, temple, rendered, in, greek, as, a, o, ai, gy, ptos, by, manetho, is, believed, to, be, the, etymological, origin, of, the, modern, english, name, egypt, the, history, of, memphis, is, closely, linked, to, that, of, the, country, itself, its, eventual, downfall, is, believed, to, have, been, due, to, the, loss, of, its, economic, significance, in, late, antiquity, following, the, rise, of, coastal, alexandria, its, religious, significance, was, diminished, after, the, abandonment, of, the, ancient, religion, following, the, edict, of, thessalonica, 380, ad, which, made, nicene, christianity, the, sole, religion, of, the, roman, empire, by, the, middle, ages, nearby, cairo, had, emerged, as, a, major, political, and, economic, center, today, the, ruins, of, the, former, capital, offer, fragmented, evidence, of, its, past, many, of, its, remains, have, become, significant, tourist, destinations, memphis, has, had, several, names, during, its, history, of, almost, four, millennia, its, ancient, egyptian, name, was, inebu, hedj, translated, as, the, white, walls, because, of, its, size, the, city, also, came, to, be, known, by, various, other, names, that, were, the, names, of, neighbourhoods, or, districts, that, enjoyed, considerable, prominence, at, one, time, or, another, for, example, according, to, a, text, of, the, first, intermediate, period, it, was, known, as, djed, sut, everlasting, places, which, is, the, name, of, the, pyramid, of, teti, at, one, point, the, city, was, referred, to, as, ankh, tawy, meaning, life, of, the, two, lands, stressing, the, strategic, position, of, the, city, between, upper, egypt, and, lower, egypt, this, name, appears, to, date, from, the, middle, kingdom, c, 2055, 1640, bce, and, is, frequently, found, in, ancient, egyptian, texts, some, scholars, maintain, that, this, name, was, that, of, an, area, that, contained, a, sacred, tree, the, western, district, of, the, city, that, lay, between, the, great, temple, of, ptah, and, the, necropolis, at, saqqara, at, the, beginning, of, the, new, kingdom, c, 1550, bc, the, city, became, known, as, mn, nfr, anglicized, as, men, nefer, meaning, enduring, and, beautiful, which, became, memfi, in, bohairic, coptic, the, name, memphis, is, the, greek, adaptation, of, the, name, that, they, had, given, to, the, pyramid, of, pepi, i, located, west, of, the, city, some, claim, that, modern, town, mit, rahina, received, its, name, from, the, ancient, egyptian, later, name, for, memphis, mjt, rhnt, meaning, road, of, the, ram, headed, sphinxes, being, a, reference, to, the, ancient, causeway, connecting, memphis, and, saqqara, on, which, the, procession, of, the, dead, bull, travelled, for, burial, in, the, serapeum, of, saqqara, but, its, been, rejected, by, numerous, egyptologists, on, the, basis, of, the, town, s, earlier, name, minyat, rahina, arabic, which, could, possibly, be, derived, from, the, name, of, a, bedouin, tribe, while, attempting, to, draw, ancient, egyptian, history, and, religious, elements, into, that, of, their, own, traditions, the, greek, poet, hesiod, in, his, theogony, explained, the, name, of, the, city, by, saying, that, memphis, was, a, daughter, of, the, greek, river, god, nilus, and, the, wife, of, epaphus, the, son, of, zeus, and, io, who, founded, the, city, and, named, it, after, his, wife, in, the, bible, memphis, is, called, moph, the, muslim, tradition, adopted, the, coptic, etymology, which, operates, with, an, etymon, m, fah,

849667, n, 31, 254278, e, 29, 849667, 31, 254278, the, city, was, also, the, place, that, marked, the, boundary, between, upper, egypt, and, lower, egypt, the, 22nd, nome, of, upper, egypt, and, 1st, nome, of, lower, egypt, today, the, footprint, of, the, ancient, city, is, uninhabited, the, closest, modern, settlement, is, the, town, of, mit, rahina, estimates, of, historical, population, size, differ, widely, among, sources, according, to, tertius, chandler, memphis, had, some, 30, 000, inhabitants, and, was, by, far, the, largest, settlement, worldwide, from, the, time, of, its, foundation, until, approximately, 2250, bc, and, from, 1557, to, 1400, bc, k, a, bard, is, more, cautious, and, estimates, the, city, s, population, to, have, numbered, approximately, 6, 000, inhabitants, during, the, old, kingdom, during, the, early, dynastic, period, and, old, kingdom, memphis, became, the, capital, of, ancient, egypt, for, more, than, six, consecutive, dynasties, the, city, reached, a, peak, of, prestige, under, the, sixth, dynasty, as, a, centre, for, the, worship, of, ptah, the, god, of, creation, and, artworks, the, alabaster, sphinx, that, guards, the, temple, of, ptah, serves, as, a, memorial, of, the, city, s, former, power, and, prestige, the, memphis, triad, consisting, of, the, creator, god, ptah, his, consort, sekhmet, and, their, son, nefertem, formed, the, main, focus, of, worship, in, the, city, memphis, declined, after, the, eighteenth, dynasty, with, the, rise, of, thebes, and, the, new, kingdom, but, was, revived, under, the, persians, before, falling, firmly, into, second, place, following, the, founding, of, alexandria, under, the, roman, empire, alexandria, remained, the, most, important, egyptian, city, memphis, remained, the, second, city, of, egypt, until, the, establishment, of, fustat, or, fostat, in, 641, ad, afterward, it, was, largely, abandoned, and, became, a, source, of, stone, for, the, surrounding, settlements, it, was, still, an, imposing, set, of, ruins, in, the, twelfth, century, but, soon, became, little, more, than, an, expanse, of, low, ruins, and, scattered, stone, the, legend, recorded, by, manetho, was, that, menes, the, first, king, to, unite, the, two, lands, established, his, capital, on, the, banks, of, the, nile, by, diverting, the, river, with, dikes, the, greek, historian, herodotus, who, tells, a, similar, story, relates, that, during, his, visit, to, the, city, the, persians, at, that, point, the, suzerains, of, the, country, paid, particular, attention, to, the, condition, of, these, dams, so, that, the, city, was, saved, from, the, annual, flooding, it, has, been, theorised, that, menes, may, have, been, a, mythical, king, similar, to, romulus, of, rome, some, scholars, suggest, that, egypt, most, likely, became, unified, through, mutual, need, developing, cultural, ties, and, trading, partnerships, although, it, is, undisputed, that, the, first, capital, of, united, egypt, was, the, city, of, memphis, some, egyptologists, had, identified, the, legendary, menes, with, the, historical, narmer, who, is, represented, on, the, palette, of, narmer, conquering, the, territory, of, the, nile, delta, in, lower, egypt, and, establishing, himself, as, king, this, palette, has, been, dated, to, ca, 31st, century, bc, and, thus, would, correlate, with, the, legend, of, egypt, s, unification, by, menes, however, in, 2012, an, inscription, depicting, the, visit, of, the, predynastic, king, iry, hor, to, memphis, was, discovered, in, the, sinai, since, iry, hor, predates, narmer, by, two, generations, the, latter, cannot, have, been, the, founder, of, the, city, alternatively, epaphus, king, of, egypt, whose, wife, was, memphis, is, regarded, in, the, greek, myths, as, the, founder, of, memphis, egypt, little, is, known, about, the, city, of, the, old, kingdom, and, before, it, was, the, state, capital, of, the, powerful, kings, who, reigned, from, memphis, from, the, date, of, the, first, dynasty, according, to, manetho, during, the, earliest, years, of, the, reign, of, menes, the, seat, of, power, was, farther, to, the, south, at, thinis, according, to, manetho, ancient, sources, suggest, the, white, walls, ineb, hedj, or, fortress, of, the, white, wall, were, founded, by, menes, it, is, likely, that, the, king, established, himself, there, to, better, control, the, new, union, between, the, two, kingdoms, that, formerly, were, rivals, the, complex, of, djoser, of, the, third, dynasty, located, in, the, ancient, necropolis, at, saqqara, would, then, be, the, royal, funerary, chamber, housing, all, the, elements, necessary, to, royalty, temples, shrines, ceremonial, courts, palaces, and, barracks, the, golden, age, began, with, the, fourth, dynasty, which, seems, to, have, furthered, the, primary, role, of, memphis, as, a, royal, residence, where, rulers, received, the, double, crown, the, divine, manifestation, of, the, unification, of, the, two, lands, coronations, and, jubilees, such, as, the, sed, festival, were, celebrated, in, the, temple, of, ptah, the, earliest, signs, of, such, ceremonies, were, found, in, the, chambers, of, djoser, during, this, period, the, clergy, of, the, temple, of, ptah, came, into, being, the, importance, of, the, temple, is, attested, with, payments, of, food, and, other, goods, necessary, for, the, funerary, rites, of, royal, and, noble, dignitaries, this, temple, also, is, cited, in, the, annals, preserved, on, the, palermo, stone, and, beginning, from, the, reign, of, menkaura, we, know, the, names, of, the, high, priests, of, memphis, who, seem, to, have, worked, in, pairs, at, least, until, the, reign, of, teti, the, architecture, of, this, period, was, similar, to, that, seen, at, giza, royal, necropolis, of, the, fourth, dynasty, where, recent, excavations, have, revealed, that, the, essential, focus, of, the, kingdom, at, that, time, centred, on, the, construction, of, the, royal, tombs, a, strong, suggestion, of, this, notion, is, the, etymology, of, the, name, of, the, city, itself, which, matched, that, of, the, pyramid, of, pepi, i, of, the, sixth, dynasty, memphis, was, then, the, heir, to, a, long, artistic, and, architectural, practice, constantly, encouraged, by, the, monuments, of, preceding, reigns, all, these, necropoleis, were, surrounded, by, camps, inhabited, by, craftsmen, and, labourers, dedicated, exclusively, to, the, construction, of, royal, tombs, spread, over, several, kilometres, stretching, in, all, directions, memphis, formed, a, true, megalopolis, with, temples, connected, by, sacred, temenos, and, ports, connected, by, roadways, and, canals, the, perimeter, of, the, city, thus, gradually, extended, into, a, vast, urban, sprawl, its, centre, remained, around, the, temple, complex, of, ptah, at, the, beginning, of, the, middle, kingdom, the, capital, and, court, of, the, king, had, moved, to, thebes, in, the, south, leaving, memphis, for, a, time, although, the, seat, of, political, power, had, shifted, memphis, did, remain, perhaps, the, most, important, commercial, and, artistic, centre, as, evidenced, by, the, discovery, of, handicrafts, districts, and, cemeteries, located, west, of, the, temple, of, ptah, also, found, were, vestiges, attesting, to, the, architectural, focus, of, this, time, a, large, granite, offering, table, on, behalf, of, amenemhat, i, mentioned, the, erection, by, the, king, of, a, shrine, to, the, god, ptah, master, of, truth, other, blocks, registered, in, the, name, of, amenemhat, ii, were, found, to, be, used, as, foundations, for, large, monoliths, preceding, the, pylons, of, ramses, ii, these, kings, were, also, known, to, have, ordered, mining, expeditions, raids, or, military, campaigns, beyond, the, borders, erecting, monuments, or, statues, to, the, consecration, of, deities, evinced, by, a, panel, recording, official, acts, of, the, royal, court, during, this, time, in, the, ruins, of, the, temple, of, ptah, a, block, in, the, name, of, senusret, ii, bears, an, inscription, indicating, an, architectural, commission, as, a, gift, to, the, deities, of, memphis, moreover, many, statues, found, at, the, site, later, restored, by, the, new, kingdom, kings, are, attributed, to, kings, of, the, twelfth, dynasty, examples, include, the, two, stone, giants, that, have, been, recovered, amidst, the, temple, ruins, which, were, later, restored, under, the, name, of, rameses, ii, finally, according, to, the, tradition, recorded, by, herodotus, and, diodorus, amenemhat, iii, built, the, northern, gate, of, the, temple, of, ptah, remains, attributed, to, this, king, were, indeed, found, during, the, excavations, in, this, area, conducted, by, flinders, petrie, who, confirmed, the, connection, it, is, also, worth, noting, that, during, this, time, mastabas, of, the, high, priests, of, ptah, were, constructed, near, the, royal, pyramids, at, saqqara, showing, that, the, royalty, and, the, clergy, of, memphis, at, that, time, were, closely, linked, the, thirteenth, dynasty, continued, this, trend, and, some, kings, of, this, line, were, buried, at, saqqara, attesting, that, memphis, retained, its, place, at, the, heart, of, the, monarchy, with, the, invasion, of, the, hyksos, and, their, rise, to, power, ca, 1650, bc, the, city, of, memphis, came, under, siege, following, its, capture, many, monuments, and, statues, of, the, ancient, capital, were, dismantled, looted, or, damaged, by, the, hyksos, kings, who, later, carried, them, off, to, adorn, their, new, capital, at, avaris, evidence, of, royal, propaganda, has, been, uncovered, and, attributed, to, the, theban, kings, of, the, seventeenth, dynasty, who, initiated, the, reconquest, of, the, kingdom, half, a, century, later, the, eighteenth, dynasty, thus, opened, with, the, victory, over, the, invaders, by, the, thebans, some, eighteenth, dynasty, kings, particularly, amenhotep, ii, r, 1427, 1401, 1397, bc, and, thutmose, iv, r, 1401, 1397, 1391, 1388, bc, gave, considerable, royal, focus, to, memphis, but, for, the, most, part, power, remained, in, the, south, with, the, long, period, of, peace, that, followed, prosperity, again, took, hold, of, the, city, which, benefited, from, her, strategic, position, strengthening, trade, ties, with, other, empires, made, the, nearby, port, of, peru, nefer, literally, good, travels, or, bon, voyage, the, gateway, to, the, kingdom, for, neighbouring, regions, including, byblos, and, the, levant, in, the, new, kingdom, memphis, became, a, centre, for, the, education, of, royal, princes, and, the, sons, of, the, nobility, amenhotep, ii, born, and, raised, in, memphis, was, made, the, setem, the, high, priest, over, lower, egypt, during, the, reign, of, his, father, his, son, thutmose, iv, received, his, famed, and, recorded, dream, whilst, residing, as, a, young, prince, in, memphis, during, his, exploration, of, the, site, karl, richard, lepsius, identified, a, series, of, blocks, and, broken, colonnades, in, the, name, of, thutmose, iv, to, the, east, of, the, temple, of, ptah, they, had, to, belong, to, a, royal, building, most, likely, a, ceremonial, palace, the, founding, of, the, temple, of, astarte, mespotamian, or, assyrian, goddess, of, fertility, and, war, babylonian, ishtar, which, herodotus, syncretically, understands, is, dedicated, to, the, greek, goddess, aphrodite, also, may, be, dated, to, the, eighteenth, dynasty, specifically, the, reign, of, amenhotep, iii, r, 1388, 86, 1351, 1349, bc, the, greatest, work, of, this, king, in, memphis, however, was, a, temple, called, nebmaatra, united, with, ptah, which, is, cited, by, many, sources, from, the, period, of, his, reign, including, artefacts, listing, the, works, of, huy, the, high, steward, of, memphis, the, location, of, this, temple, has, not, been, precisely, determined, but, a, number, of, its, brown, quartzite, blocks, were, found, to, have, been, reused, by, ramesses, ii, r, 1279, 1213, bc, for, the, construction, of, the, small, temple, of, ptah, this, leads, some, egyptologists, to, suggest, that, the, latter, temple, had, been, built, over, the, site, of, the, first, according, to, inscriptions, found, in, memphis, akhenaten, r, 1353, 51, 1336, 34, bc, formerly, amenhotep, iv, founded, a, temple, of, aten, in, the, city, the, burial, chamber, of, one, of, the, priests, of, this, cult, has, been, uncovered, at, saqqara, his, successor, tutankhamun, r, 1332, 1323, bc, formerly, tutankhaten, relocated, the, royal, court, from, akhenaten, s, capital, akhetaten, horizon, of, the, aten, to, memphis, before, the, end, of, the, second, year, of, his, reign, whilst, in, memphis, tutankhamun, initiated, a, period, of, restoration, of, the, temples, and, traditions, following, the, era, of, atenism, which, became, regarded, as, heresy, the, tombs, of, important, officials, from, his, reign, such, as, horemheb, and, maya, are, situated, in, saqqara, although, horemheb, was, buried, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, after, reigning, as, king, himself, r, 1319, 1292, bc, he, had, been, commander, of, the, army, under, tutankhamun, and, ay, maya, was, overseer, of, the, treasury, during, the, reigns, of, tutankhamun, ay, and, horemheb, ay, had, been, tutankhamun, s, chief, minister, and, succeeded, him, as, king, r, 1323, 1319, bc, to, consolidate, his, power, he, married, tutankhamun, s, widow, ankhesenamun, the, third, of, the, six, daughters, of, akhenaten, and, nefertiti, her, fate, is, unknown, similarly, horemheb, consolidated, power, when, he, married, nefertiti, s, sister, mutnodjemet, there, is, evidence, that, under, ramesses, ii, the, city, developed, new, importance, in, the, political, sphere, through, its, proximity, to, the, new, capital, pi, ramesses, the, king, devoted, many, monuments, in, memphis, and, adorned, them, with, colossal, symbols, of, glory, merneptah, r, 1213, 1203, bc, his, successor, constructed, a, palace, and, developed, the, southeast, wall, of, the, temple, of, ptah, for, the, early, part, of, the, 19th, dynasty, memphis, received, the, privileges, of, royal, attention, and, it, is, this, dynasty, that, is, most, evident, among, the, ruins, of, the, city, today, with, the, twenty, first, and, twenty, second, dynasties, there, is, a, continuation, of, the, religious, development, initiated, by, ramesses, memphis, does, not, seem, to, have, suffered, a, decline, during, the, third, intermediate, period, which, saw, great, changes, in, the, geopolitics, of, the, country, instead, it, is, likely, that, the, kings, worked, to, develop, the, memphite, cult, in, their, new, capital, of, tanis, to, the, northeast, in, light, of, some, remains, found, at, the, site, it, is, known, that, a, temple, of, ptah, was, based, there, siamun, is, cited, as, having, built, a, temple, dedicated, to, amun, the, remains, of, which, were, found, by, flinders, petrie, in, the, early, twentieth, century, in, the, south, of, the, temple, of, ptah, complex, according, to, inscriptions, describing, his, architectural, work, sheshonk, i, r, 943, 922, bc, founder, of, the, twenty, second, dynasty, constructed, a, forecourt, and, pylon, of, the, temple, of, ptah, a, monument, that, he, named, the, castle, of, millions, of, years, of, sheshonk, beloved, of, amun, the, funerary, cult, surrounding, this, monument, well, known, in, the, new, kingdom, was, still, functioning, several, generations, after, its, establishment, at, the, temple, leading, some, scholars, to, suggest, that, it, may, have, contained, the, royal, burial, chamber, of, the, king, sheshonk, also, ordered, the, building, of, a, new, shrine, for, the, god, apis, especially, devoted, to, funeral, ceremonies, in, which, the, bull, was, led, to, his, death, before, being, ritually, mummified, a, necropolis, for, the, high, priests, of, memphis, dating, precisely, from, the, twenty, second, dynasty, has, been, found, west, of, the, forum, it, included, a, chapel, dedicated, to, ptah, by, a, prince, shoshenq, son, of, osorkon, ii, r, 872, 837, bc, whose, tomb, was, found, in, saqqara, in, 1939, by, pierre, montet, the, chapel, is, currently, visible, in, the, gardens, of, the, egyptian, museum, in, cairo, behind, a, trio, of, colossi, of, ramesses, ii, which, are, also, from, memphis, during, the, third, intermediate, period, and, the, late, period, memphis, is, often, the, scene, of, liberation, struggles, of, the, local, dynasties, against, an, occupying, force, such, as, the, kushites, assyrians, and, persians, the, triumphant, campaign, of, piankhi, ruler, of, the, kushites, saw, the, establishment, of, the, twenty, fifth, dynasty, whose, seat, of, power, was, in, napata, piankhi, s, conquest, of, egypt, was, recorded, on, the, victory, stele, at, the, temple, of, amun, in, gebel, barkal, following, the, capture, of, memphis, he, restored, the, temples, and, cults, neglected, during, the, reign, of, the, libyans, his, successors, are, known, for, building, chapels, in, the, southwest, corner, of, the, temple, of, ptah, memphis, was, at, the, heart, of, the, turmoil, produced, by, the, great, assyrian, threat, under, taharqa, the, city, formed, the, frontier, base, of, the, resistance, which, soon, crumbled, as, the, kushite, king, was, driven, back, into, nubia, the, assyrian, king, esarhaddon, supported, by, some, of, the, native, egyptian, princes, captured, memphis, in, 671, bc, his, forces, sacked, and, raided, the, city, slaughtered, villagers, and, erected, piles, of, their, heads, esarhaddon, returned, to, his, capital, nineveh, with, rich, booty, and, erected, a, victory, stele, showing, the, son, of, taharqa, in, chains, almost, as, soon, as, the, king, left, egypt, rebelled, against, assyrian, rule, in, assyria, ashurbanipal, succeeded, his, father, and, resumed, the, offensive, against, egypt, in, a, massive, invasion, in, 664, bc, the, city, of, memphis, was, again, sacked, and, looted, and, the, king, tantamani, was, pursued, into, nubia, and, defeated, putting, a, definitive, end, to, the, kushite, reign, over, egypt, power, then, returned, to, the, saite, kings, who, fearful, of, an, invasion, from, the, babylonians, reconstructed, and, even, fortified, structures, in, the, city, as, is, attested, by, the, palace, built, by, apries, at, kom, tuman, egypt, and, memphis, were, taken, for, persia, by, king, cambyses, in, 525, bc, after, the, battle, of, pelusium, under, the, persians, structures, in, the, city, were, preserved, and, strengthened, and, memphis, was, made, the, administrative, headquarters, of, the, newly, conquered, satrapy, a, persian, garrison, was, permanently, installed, within, the, city, probably, in, the, great, north, wall, near, the, domineering, palace, of, apries, the, excavations, by, flinders, petrie, revealed, that, this, sector, included, armouries, for, almost, a, century, and, a, half, the, city, remained, the, capital, of, the, persian, satrapy, of, egypt, mudraya, musraya, officially, becoming, one, of, the, epicentres, of, commerce, in, the, vast, territory, conquered, by, the, achaemenid, monarchy, the, stelae, dedicated, to, apis, in, the, serapeum, at, saqqara, commissioned, by, the, reigning, monarch, represent, a, key, element, in, understanding, the, events, of, this, period, as, in, the, late, period, the, catacombs, in, which, the, remains, of, the, sacred, bulls, were, buried, gradually, grew, in, size, and, later, took, on, a, monumental, appearance, that, confirms, the, growth, of, the, cult, s, hypostases, throughout, the, country, and, particularly, in, memphis, and, its, necropolis, thus, a, monument, dedicated, by, cambyses, ii, seems, to, refute, the, testimony, of, herodotus, who, lends, the, conquerors, a, criminal, attitude, of, disrespect, against, the, sacred, traditions, the, nationalist, awakening, came, with, the, rise, to, power, however, briefly, of, amyrtaeus, in, 404, bc, who, ended, the, persian, occupation, he, was, defeated, and, executed, at, memphis, in, october, 399, bc, by, nepherites, i, founder, of, the, twenty, ninth, dynasty, the, execution, was, recorded, in, an, aramaic, papyrus, document, papyrus, brooklyn, 13, nepherites, moved, the, capital, to, mendes, in, the, eastern, delta, and, memphis, lost, its, status, in, the, political, sphere, it, retained, however, its, religious, commercial, and, strategic, importance, and, was, instrumental, in, resisting, persian, attempts, to, reconquer, egypt, under, nectanebo, i, a, major, rebuilding, program, was, initiated, for, temples, across, the, country, in, memphis, a, powerful, new, wall, was, rebuilt, for, the, temple, of, ptah, and, developments, were, made, to, temples, and, chapels, inside, the, complex, nectanebo, ii, meanwhile, while, continuing, the, work, of, his, predecessor, began, building, large, sanctuaries, especially, in, the, necropolis, of, saqqara, adorning, them, with, pylons, statues, and, paved, roads, lined, with, rows, of, sphinxes, despite, his, efforts, to, prevent, the, recovery, of, the, country, by, the, persians, he, succumbed, to, an, invasion, in, 340, bc, nectanebo, ii, retreated, south, to, memphis, to, which, the, achaemenid, king, artaxerxes, iii, laid, siege, forcing, the, king, to, flee, to, upper, egypt, and, eventually, to, nubia, a, brief, liberation, of, the, city, under, the, rebel, king, khababash, 338, to, 335, bc, is, evinced, by, an, apis, bull, sarcophagus, bearing, his, name, which, was, discovered, at, saqqara, dating, from, his, second, year, the, armies, of, darius, iii, eventually, regained, control, of, the, city, memphis, under, the, late, period, saw, recurring, invasions, followed, by, successive, liberations, several, times, besieged, it, was, the, scene, of, several, of, the, bloodiest, battles, in, the, history, of, the, country, despite, the, support, of, their, greek, allies, in, undermining, the, hegemony, of, the, achaemenids, the, country, nevertheless, fell, into, the, hands, of, the, conquerors, and, memphis, was, never, again, to, become, the, nation, s, capital, in, 332, bc, came, the, greeks, who, took, control, of, the, country, from, the, persians, and, egypt, would, never, see, a, new, native, ruler, ascend, the, throne, until, the, egyptian, revolution, of, 1952, in, 332, bc, alexander, the, great, was, crowned, king, in, the, temple, of, ptah, ushering, in, the, hellenistic, period, the, city, retained, a, significant, status, especially, religious, throughout, the, period, following, the, takeover, by, one, of, his, generals, ptolemy, i, on, the, death, of, alexander, in, babylon, 323, bce, ptolemy, took, great, pains, in, acquiring, his, body, and, bringing, it, to, memphis, claiming, that, the, king, had, officially, expressed, a, desire, to, be, buried, in, egypt, he, then, carried, the, body, of, alexander, to, the, heart, of, the, temple, of, ptah, and, had, him, embalmed, by, the, priests, by, custom, kings, in, macedon, asserted, their, right, to, the, throne, by, burying, their, predecessor, ptolemy, ii, later, transferred, the, sarcophagus, to, alexandria, where, a, royal, tomb, was, constructed, for, its, burial, the, exact, location, of, the, tomb, has, been, lost, since, then, according, to, aelian, the, seer, aristander, foretold, that, the, land, where, alexander, was, laid, to, rest, would, be, happy, and, unvanquishable, forever, thus, began, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, during, which, began, the, city, s, gradual, decline, it, was, ptolemy, i, who, first, introduced, the, cult, of, serapis, in, egypt, establishing, his, cult, in, saqqara, from, this, period, date, many, developments, of, the, saqqara, serapeum, including, the, building, of, the, chamber, of, poets, as, well, as, the, dromos, adorning, the, temple, and, many, elements, of, greek, inspired, architecture, the, cult, s, reputation, extended, beyond, the, borders, of, the, country, but, was, later, eclipsed, by, the, great, alexandrian, serapeum, built, in, ptolemy, s, honour, by, his, successors, the, decrees, of, memphis, were, issued, in, 216, and, 196, bc, by, ptolemy, iv, and, ptolemy, v, respectively, delegates, from, the, principal, clergies, of, the, kingdom, gathered, in, synod, under, the, patronage, of, the, high, priest, of, ptah, and, in, the, presence, of, the, king, to, establish, the, religious, policy, of, the, country, for, years, to, come, also, dictating, fees, and, taxes, creating, new, foundations, and, paying, tribute, to, the, ptolemaic, rulers, these, decrees, were, engraved, on, stelae, in, three, scripts, to, be, read, and, understood, by, all, demotic, hieroglyphic, and, greek, the, most, famous, of, these, stelae, is, the, rosetta, stone, which, allowed, the, deciphering, of, ancient, egyptian, script, in, the, nineteenth, century, there, were, other, stelae, funerary, this, time, discovered, on, the, site, that, have, forwarded, knowledge, of, the, genealogy, of, the, higher, clergy, of, memphis, a, dynasty, of, high, priests, of, ptah, the, lineage, retained, strong, ties, with, the, royal, family, in, alexandria, to, the, extent, that, marriages, occurred, between, certain, high, priests, and, ptolemaic, princesses, strengthening, even, further, the, commitment, between, the, two, families, with, the, arrival, of, the, romans, memphis, like, thebes, lost, its, place, permanently, in, favour, of, alexandria, which, opened, onto, the, empire, the, rise, of, the, cult, of, serapis, a, syncretic, deity, most, suited, to, the, mentality, of, the, new, rulers, of, egypt, and, the, emergence, of, christianity, taking, root, deep, into, the, country, spelled, the, complete, ruin, of, the, ancient, cults, of, memphis, during, the, byzantine, and, coptic, periods, the, city, gradually, dwindled, and, finally, dropped, out, of, existence, it, then, became, a, quarry, from, which, its, stones, were, used, to, build, new, settlements, nearby, including, fustat, the, new, capital, founded, by, the, arabs, who, took, possession, in, the, seventh, century, ad, the, foundations, of, fustat, and, later, cairo, both, built, farther, north, were, laid, with, stones, of, dismantled, temples, and, ancient, necropoleis, of, memphis, in, the, thirteenth, century, the, arab, chronicler, abd, ul, latif, upon, visiting, the, site, described, and, gave, testimony, to, the, grandeur, of, the, ruins, enormous, as, are, the, extent, and, antiquity, of, this, city, in, spite, of, the, frequent, change, of, governments, whose, yoke, it, has, borne, and, the, great, pains, more, than, one, nation, has, been, at, to, destroy, it, to, sweep, its, last, trace, from, the, face, of, the, earth, to, carry, away, the, stones, and, materials, of, which, it, was, constructed, to, mutilate, the, statues, which, adorned, it, in, spite, finally, of, all, that, more, than, four, thousand, years, have, done, in, addition, to, man, these, ruins, still, offer, to, the, eye, of, the, beholder, a, mass, of, marvels, which, bewilder, the, senses, and, which, the, most, skillful, pens, must, fail, to, describe, the, more, deeply, we, contemplate, this, city, the, more, our, admiration, rises, and, every, fresh, glance, at, the, ruins, is, a, fresh, source, of, delight, the, ruins, of, memphis, hold, a, half, day, s, journey, in, every, direction, although, the, remains, today, are, nothing, compared, to, what, was, witnessed, by, the, arab, historian, his, testimony, has, inspired, the, work, of, many, archaeologists, the, first, surveys, and, excavations, of, the, nineteenth, century, and, the, extensive, work, of, flinders, petrie, have, been, able, to, show, a, little, of, the, former, glory, of, the, ancient, capital, memphis, and, its, necropolis, which, include, funerary, rock, tombs, mastabas, temples, and, pyramids, were, inscribed, on, the, world, heritage, list, of, unesco, in, 1979, during, the, time, of, the, new, kingdom, and, especially, under, the, reign, of, the, rulers, of, the, nineteenth, dynasty, memphis, flourished, in, power, and, size, rivalling, thebes, both, politically, and, architecturally, an, indicator, of, this, development, can, be, found, in, a, chapel, of, seti, i, dedicated, to, the, worship, of, ptah, after, more, than, a, century, of, excavations, on, the, site, archaeologists, have, gradually, been, able, to, confirm, the, layout, and, expansion, of, the, ancient, city, the, hout, ka, ptah, dedicated, to, the, worship, of, the, creator, god, ptah, was, the, largest, and, most, important, temple, in, ancient, memphis, it, was, one, of, the, most, prominent, structures, in, the, city, occupying, a, large, precinct, within, the, city, s, centre, enriched, by, centuries, of, veneration, the, temple, was, one, of, the, three, foremost, places, of, worship, in, ancient, egypt, the, others, being, the, great, temples, of, ra, in, heliopolis, and, of, amun, in, thebes, much, of, what, is, known, today, about, the, ancient, temple, comes, from, the, writings, of, herodotus, who, visited, the, site, at, the, time, of, the, first, persian, invasion, long, after, the, fall, of, the, new, kingdom, herodotus, claimed, that, the, temple, had, been, founded, by, menes, and, that, the, core, building, of, the, complex, was, restricted, to, priests, and, kings, his, account, however, gives, no, physical, description, of, the, complex, archaeological, work, undertaken, in, the, last, century, has, gradually, unearthed, the, temple, s, ruins, revealing, a, huge, walled, compound, accessible, by, several, monumental, gates, located, along, the, southern, western, and, eastern, walls, the, remains, of, the, great, temple, and, its, premises, are, displayed, as, an, open, air, museum, near, the, great, colossus, of, rameses, ii, which, originally, marked, the, southern, axis, of, the, temple, also, in, this, sector, is, a, large, sphinx, monolith, discovered, in, the, nineteenth, century, it, dates, from, the, eighteenth, dynasty, most, likely, having, been, carved, during, the, reign, of, either, amenhotep, ii, or, thutmose, iv, it, is, one, of, the, finest, examples, of, this, kind, statuary, still, present, on, its, original, site, the, outdoor, museum, houses, numerous, other, statues, colossi, sphinxes, and, architectural, elements, however, the, majority, of, the, finds, have, been, sold, to, major, museums, around, the, world, for, the, most, part, these, can, be, found, on, display, in, the, egyptian, museum, in, cairo, the, specific, appearance, of, the, temple, is, unclear, at, present, and, only, that, of, the, main, access, to, the, perimeter, are, known, recent, developments, include, the, discovery, of, giant, statues, that, adorned, the, gates, or, towers, those, that, have, been, found, date, from, the, reign, of, ramsses, ii, this, king, also, built, at, least, three, shrines, within, the, temple, compound, where, worship, is, associated, with, those, deities, to, whom, they, were, dedicated, this, small, temple, adjoining, the, southwest, corner, of, the, larger, temple, of, ptah, was, dedicated, to, the, deified, rameses, ii, along, with, the, three, state, deities, horus, ptah, and, amun, it, is, known, in, full, as, the, temple, of, ptah, of, rameses, beloved, of, amun, god, ruler, of, heliopolis, its, ruins, were, discovered, in, 1942, by, archaeologist, ahmed, badawy, and, were, excavated, in, 1955, by, rudolf, anthes, the, excavations, uncovered, a, religious, building, complete, with, a, tower, a, courtyard, for, ritual, offerings, a, portico, with, columns, followed, by, a, pillared, hall, and, a, tripartite, sanctuary, all, enclosed, in, walls, built, of, mudbricks, its, most, recent, exterior, has, been, dated, from, the, new, kingdom, era, the, temple, opened, to, the, east, toward, a, path, paved, with, other, religious, buildings, the, archaeological, explorations, that, took, place, here, reveal, that, the, southern, part, of, the, city, indeed, contain, a, large, number, of, religious, buildings, with, a, particular, devotion, to, the, god, ptah, the, principal, deity, of, memphis, located, farther, east, and, near, to, the, great, colossus, of, rameses, this, small, temple, is, attributed, to, the, nineteenth, dynasty, and, seems, to, have, been, dedicated, to, ptah, and, his, divine, consort, sekhmet, as, well, as, deified, rameses, ii, its, ruins, are, not, so, well, preserved, as, others, nearby, as, its, limestone, foundations, appear, to, have, been, quarried, after, the, abandonment, of, the, city, in, late, antiquity, two, giant, statues, dating, from, the, middle, kingdom, originally, adorned, the, building, s, facade, which, opened, to, the, west, they, were, moved, inside, the, museum, of, memphis, and, depicted, the, king, standing, in, the, attitude, of, the, march, wearing, the, hedjet, the, white, crown, of, upper, egypt, in, the, southeast, of, the, great, temple, complex, the, king, merneptah, of, the, nineteenth, dynasty, founded, a, new, shrine, in, honour, of, the, chief, deity, of, the, city, ptah, this, temple, was, discovered, in, the, early, twentieth, century, by, flinders, petrie, who, identified, it, as, a, depiction, of, the, greek, god, proteus, cited, by, herodotus, the, site, was, excavated, during, the, first, world, war, by, clarence, stanley, fisher, excavations, began, in, the, anterior, part, which, is, formed, by, a, large, courtyard, of, approximately, 15, sq, metres, opening, on, the, south, by, a, large, door, with, reliefs, supplying, the, names, of, the, king, and, the, epithets, of, ptah, only, this, part, of, the, temple, has, been, unearthed, the, remainder, of, the, chamber, has, yet, to, be, explored, a, little, farther, north, during, the, excavations, archaeologists, unearthed, the, first, traces, of, an, edifice, built, of, mudbrick, which, quickly, proved, to, be, a, large, ceremonial, palace, built, alongside, the, temple, proper, some, of, the, key, elements, of, the, stone, temple, were, donated, by, egypt, to, the, museum, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, which, financed, the, expedition, while, the, other, remained, at, the, egyptian, museum, in, cairo, the, temple, remained, in, use, throughout, the, rest, of, the, new, kingdom, as, evidenced, by, enrolment, surges, during, the, reigns, of, later, kings, thereafter, however, it, was, gradually, abandoned, and, converted, for, other, uses, by, civilians, gradually, buried, by, the, activity, of, the, city, the, stratigraphic, study, of, the, site, shows, that, by, the, late, period, it, was, already, in, ruins, and, is, soon, covered, by, new, buildings, this, small, temple, of, hathor, was, unearthed, south, of, the, great, wall, of, the, hout, ka, ptah, by, abdullah, al, sayed, mahmud, in, the, 1970s, and, also, dates, from, the, time, of, rameses, ii, dedicated, to, the, goddess, hathor, lady, of, the, sycamore, it, presents, an, architecture, similar, to, the, small, temple, shrines, known, especially, to, karnak, from, its, proportions, it, does, not, seem, to, be, a, major, shrine, of, the, goddess, but, is, currently, the, only, building, dedicated, to, her, discovered, in, the, city, s, ruins, it, is, believed, that, this, shrine, was, primarily, used, for, processional, purposes, during, major, religious, festivals, a, larger, temple, dedicated, to, hathor, indeed, one, of, the, foremost, shrines, of, the, goddess, in, the, country, is, thought, to, have, existed, elsewhere, in, the, city, but, to, date, has, not, been, discovered, a, depression, similar, to, that, found, near, the, great, temple, of, ptah, could, indicate, its, location, archaeologists, believe, that, it, could, house, the, remains, of, an, enclosure, and, a, large, monument, a, theory, attested, by, ancient, sources, the, temple, of, the, goddess, neith, was, said, to, have, been, located, to, the, north, of, the, temple, of, ptah, it, has, not, been, discovered, to, date, memphis, is, believed, to, have, housed, a, number, of, other, temples, dedicated, to, deities, who, accompanied, ptah, some, of, these, sanctuaries, are, attested, by, ancient, hieroglyphs, but, have, not, yet, been, found, among, the, ruins, of, the, city, surveys, and, excavations, are, still, continuing, at, nearby, mit, rahina, and, will, likely, add, to, the, knowledge, of, the, planning, of, the, ancient, religious, city, a, temple, dedicated, to, mithras, dated, from, the, roman, period, has, been, uncovered, in, the, grounds, north, of, memphis, the, temple, of, astarte, described, by, herodotus, was, located, in, the, area, reserved, to, the, phoenicians, during, the, time, when, the, greek, author, visited, the, city, but, has, not, been, discovered, to, date, a, temple, dedicated, to, the, goddess, sekhmet, consort, of, ptah, has, not, yet, been, found, but, is, currently, certified, by, egyptian, sources, archaeologists, are, still, searching, for, remains, it, may, be, located, within, the, precinct, of, the, hout, ka, ptah, as, would, seem, to, suggest, several, discoveries, made, among, the, ruins, of, the, complex, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, including, a, block, of, stone, evoking, the, great, door, with, the, epithet, of, the, goddess, and, a, column, bearing, an, inscription, on, behalf, of, rameses, ii, declaring, him, beloved, of, sekhmet, it, has, also, been, demonstrated, through, the, great, harris, papyrus, which, states, that, a, statue, of, the, goddess, was, made, alongside, those, of, ptah, and, their, son, the, god, nefertem, during, the, reign, of, rameses, iii, and, that, it, was, commissioned, for, the, deities, of, memphis, at, the, heart, of, the, great, temple, the, temple, of, apis, in, memphis, was, the, main, temple, dedicated, to, the, worship, of, the, bull, apis, considered, to, be, a, living, manifestation, of, ptah, it, is, detailed, in, the, works, of, classical, historians, such, as, herodotus, diodorus, and, strabo, but, its, location, has, yet, to, be, discovered, amidst, the, ruins, of, the, ancient, capital, according, to, herodotus, who, described, the, temple, s, courtyard, as, a, peristyle, of, columns, with, giant, statues, it, was, built, during, the, reign, of, psamtik, i, the, greek, historian, strabo, visited, the, site, with, the, conquering, roman, troops, following, the, victory, against, cleopatra, in, the, battle, of, actium, he, details, that, the, temple, consisted, of, two, chambers, one, for, the, bull, and, the, other, for, his, mother, and, all, was, built, near, the, temple, of, ptah, at, the, temple, apis, was, used, as, an, oracle, his, movements, being, interpreted, as, prophecies, his, breath, was, believed, to, cure, disease, and, his, presence, to, bless, those, around, with, virility, he, was, given, a, window, in, the, temple, through, which, he, could, be, seen, and, on, certain, holidays, was, led, through, the, streets, of, the, city, bedecked, with, jewellery, and, flowers, in, 1941, the, archaeologist, ahmed, badawy, discovered, the, first, remains, in, memphis, that, depicted, the, god, apis, the, site, located, within, the, grounds, of, the, great, temple, of, ptah, was, revealed, to, be, a, mortuary, chamber, designed, exclusively, for, the, embalming, of, the, sacred, bull, a, stele, found, at, saqqara, shows, that, nectanebo, ii, had, ordered, the, restoration, of, this, building, and, elements, dated, from, the, thirtieth, dynasty, have, been, unearthed, in, the, northern, part, of, the, chamber, confirming, the, time, of, reconstruction, in, this, part, of, the, temple, it, is, likely, that, the, mortuary, was, part, of, the, larger, temple, of, apis, cited, by, ancient, sources, this, sacred, part, of, the, temple, would, be, the, only, part, that, has, survived, and, would, confirm, the, words, of, strabo, and, diodorus, both, of, whom, stated, that, the, temple, was, located, near, the, temple, of, ptah, the, majority, of, known, apis, statues, come, from, the, burial, chambers, known, as, serapeum, located, to, the, northwest, at, saqqara, the, most, ancient, burials, found, at, this, site, date, back, to, the, reign, of, amenhotep, iii, during, the, twenty, first, dynasty, a, shrine, of, the, great, god, amun, was, built, by, siamun, to, the, south, of, the, temple, of, ptah, this, temple, or, temples, was, most, likely, dedicated, to, the, theban, triad, consisting, of, amun, his, consort, mut, and, their, son, khonsu, it, was, the, upper, egyptian, counterpart, of, the, memphis, triad, ptah, sekhmet, and, nefertem, a, temple, dedicated, to, aten, in, memphis, is, attested, by, hieroglyphs, found, within, the, tombs, of, memphite, dignitaries, of, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, uncovered, at, saqqara, among, them, that, of, tutankhamun, who, began, his, career, under, the, reign, of, his, father, akhenaten, as, a, steward, of, the, temple, of, aten, in, memphis, since, the, early, excavations, at, memphis, in, the, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, artefacts, have, been, uncovered, in, different, parts, of, the, city, that, indicate, the, presence, of, a, building, dedicated, to, the, worship, of, the, sun, disc, the, aten, the, location, of, such, a, building, is, lost, and, various, hypotheses, have, been, made, on, this, subject, based, on, the, place, of, discovery, of, the, remains, of, the, amarna, period, features, the, ruins, of, ancient, memphis, have, yielded, a, large, number, of, sculptures, representing, rameses, ii, within, the, museum, in, memphis, is, a, giant, statue, of, him, carved, of, monumental, limestone, about, 10, metres, in, length, it, was, discovered, in, 1820, near, the, southern, gate, of, the, temple, of, ptah, by, italian, archaeologist, giovanni, caviglia, because, the, base, and, feet, of, the, sculpture, are, broken, off, from, the, rest, of, the, body, it, is, currently, displayed, lying, on, its, back, some, of, the, colours, are, still, partially, preserved, but, the, beauty, of, this, statue, lies, in, its, flawless, detail, of, the, complex, and, subtle, forms, of, human, anatomy, the, king, wears, the, white, crown, of, upper, egypt, hedjet, caviglia, offered, to, send, the, statue, to, grand, duke, of, tuscany, leopold, ii, through, the, mediation, of, ippolito, rosellini, rosellini, advised, the, sovereign, of, the, terrible, expenses, involved, with, transportation, and, considered, as, necessary, the, cutting, of, the, colossus, into, pieces, the, w, li, and, self, declared, khedive, of, egypt, and, sudan, muhammad, ali, pasha, offered, to,

the, city, was, dominated, by, the, large, eastern, gate, of, the, temple, of, ptah, the, site, of, memphis, has, been, famous, since, ancient, times, and, is, cited, in, many, ancient, sources,

cults, as, do, suetonius, and, ammianus, marcellinus, who, pay, particular, attention, to, the, city, s, worship, of, apis, the, city, was, plunged, into, oblivion, during, the, christian, period, that, followed, few, sources, are, available, to, attest, to, the, city, s, activities, during, its, final, stages, it, was, not, until, the, conquest, of, the, country, by, the, arabs, that, a, description, of, the, city, reappears, by, which, time, it, was, in, ruins, among, the, major, sources, from, this, time, in, 1652, during, his, trip, to, egypt, jean, de, th, venot, identified, the, location, of, the, site, and, its, ruins, confirming, the, accounts, of, the, old, arab, authors, for, europeans, his, description, is, brief, but, represents, the, first, step, toward, the, exploration, that, will, emerge, after, the, development, of, archaeology, the, starting, point, of, archaeological, exploration, in, memphis, was, napol, on, bonaparte, s, great, foray, into, egypt, in, 1798, research, and, surveys, of, the, site, confirmed, the, identification, of, th, venot, and, the, first, studies, of, its, remains, were, carried, out, by, scientists, accompanying, french, soldiers, the, results, of, the, first, scientific, studies, were, published, in, the, monumental, description, de, l, gypte, a, map, of, the, region, the, first, to, give, the, location, of, memphis, with, precision, the, early, french, expeditions, paved, the, way, for, explorations, of, a, deeper, scope, that, would, follow, from, the, nineteenth, century, until, today, conducted, by, leading, explorers, egyptologists, and, major, archaeological, institutions, here, is, a, partial, list, during, the, british, era, in, egypt, the, development, of, agricultural, technology, along, with, the, systematic, cultivation, of, the, nile, floodplains, led, to, a, considerable, amount, of, accidental, archaeological, discoveries, much, of, what, was, found, would, fall, into, the, hands, of, major, european, collectors, travelling, the, country, on, behalf, of, the, great, museums, of, london, paris, berlin, and, turin, it, was, during, one, of, these, land, cultivations, that, peasants,

pink, granite, this, spate, of, archaeological, discoveries, gave, birth, to, the, constant, risk, of, seeing, all, these, cultural, riches, leaving, egyptian, soil, auguste, douard, mariette, who, visited, saqqara, in, 1850, became, aware, of, the, need, to, create, an, institution, in, egypt, responsible, for, the, exploration, and, conservation, of, the, country, s, archaeological, treasures,
