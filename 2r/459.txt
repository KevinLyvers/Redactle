italian, victory, italy, 1916, 1917, 1918, white, war, 1915, 1918, the, italian, front, italian, fronte, italiano, german, s, dwestfront, was, one, of, the, main, theatres, of, war, of, world, war, i, it, involved, a, series, of, military, engagements, along, the, border, between, the, kingdom, of, italy, and, austria, hungary, from, 1915, to, 1918, following, secret, promises, made, by, the, allies, in, the, 1915, treaty, of, london, the, kingdom, of, italy, entered, the, war, on, the, allied, side, aiming, to, annex, the, austrian, littoral, northern, dalmatia, and, the, territories, of, present, day, trentino, and, south, tyrol, the, front, soon, bogged, down, into, trench, warfare, similar, to, that, on, the, western, front, but, at, high, altitudes, and, with, extremely, cold, winters, fighting, along, the, front, displaced, much, of, the, local, population, and, several, thousand, civilians, died, from, malnutrition, and, illness, in, italian, and, austro, hungarian, refugee, camps, military, operations, came, to, an, end, in, 1918, with, italian, victory, and, the, capture, of, trento, and, trieste, by, italy, s, forces, austria, hungary, disintegrated, due, to, military, defeats, and, subsequent, turmoils, caused, by, pacifists, and, separatists, all, military, operations, on, the, front, came, to, an, end, with, the, entry, into, force, of, the, armistice, of, villa, giusti, on, 4, november, 1918, italy, entered, into, world, war, i, also, with, the, aim, of, completing, national, unity, with, the, annexation, of, trentino, alto, adige, and, julian, march, for, this, reason, the, italian, intervention, in, the, world, war, i, is, also, considered, the, fourth, italian, war, of, independence, in, a, historiographical, perspective, that, identifies, in, the, latter, the, conclusion, of, the, unification, of, italy, whose, military, actions, began, during, the, revolutions, of, 1848, with, the, first, italian, war, of, independence, however, if, in, the, course, of, events, the, maintenance, of, the, status, quo, in, the, regions, of, the, balkans, or, of, the, ottoman, coasts, and, islands, in, the, adriatic, and, in, the, aegean, sea, should, become, impossible, and, if, whether, in, consequence, of, the, action, of, a, third, power, or, otherwise, austria, hungary, or, italy, should, find, themselves, under, the, necessity, of, modifying, it, by, a, temporary, or, permanent, occupation, on, their, part, this, occupation, shall, take, place, only, after, a, previous, agreement, between, the, two, powers, based, upon, the, principle, of, reciprocal, compensation, for, every, advantage, territorial, or, other, which, each, of, them, might, obtain, beyond, the, present, status, quo, and, giving, satisfaction, to, the, interests, and, well, founded, claims, of, the, two, parties, the, italian, front, stretched, from, the, stelvio, pass, at, the, border, triangle, between, italy, austria, hungary, and, switzerland, along, the, tyrolean, carinthian, and, littoral, borders, to, the, isonzo, its, total, length, was, around, 600, kilometers, of, which, 450, kilometers, ran, in, high, alpine, terrain, this, information, relates, to, measurements, as, the, crow, flies, taking, into, account, the, natural, terrain, the, many, yokes, peaks, and, ridges, with, the, resulting, differences, in, height, the, effective, length, was, several, thousand, kilometers, the, front, touched, very, different, geographical, areas, in, the, first, three, sections, from, the, stelvio, pass, to, the, julian, alps, in, the, area, of, tarvisio, it, ran, through, mountainous, territory, where, the, average, ridge, heights, reached, 2, 700, to, 3, 200, meters, the, higher, mountainous, regions, have, a, highly, rugged, relief, with, little, vegetation, elevations, over, 2, 500, meters, are, also, covered, by, glaciers, the, barren, landscape, and, lack, of, sufficient, arable, land, led, to, little, development, of, these, high, elevations, settlement, was, largely, limited, to, the, lower, lying, zones, from, the, julian, alps, to, the, adriatic, sea, the, mountains, are, constantly, losing, on, height, and, only, rarely, reach, 1, 000, meters, as, in, the, area, around, gorizia, this, area, is, also, sparsely, populated, and, characterized, by, a, harsh, climate, with, cold, winters, and, very, hot, and, dry, summers, a, craggy, karst, landscape, spreads, out, around, the, isonzo, valley, which, adjoins, the, italian, foothills, of, the, alps, in, the, southwest, the, topographical, characteristics, of, the, front, area, had, a, concrete, impact, on, the, conduct, of, the, war, the, rocky, ground, for, example, made, it, difficult, to, dig, trenches, and, in, addition, the, karst, rock, in, the, isonzo, valley, turned, out, to, be, an, additional, danger, for, the, soldiers, if, grenades, exploded, on, the, porous, surface, fragments, of, the, exploding, rock, acted, as, additional, shrapnel, archduke, eugen, who, was, already, in, command, of, the, balkan, forces, was, promoted, to, generaloberst, on, may, 22, 1915, and, was, given, supreme, command, of, the, new, southwest, front, together, with, his, chief, of, staff, alfred, krau, the, 5th, army, was, reorganized, and, placed, under, the, command, of, general, d, inf, svetozar, boroevi, who, on, may, 27, had, arrived, from, the, eastern, front, the, k, u, k, landesverteidigungskommando, in, tyrol, lvk, was, handed, to, gdk, viktor, dankl, to, protect, the, tyrolean, borders, it, included, the, german, alpenkorps, which, was, suitable, for, operations, in, the, high, mountains, the, first, divisions, arrived, on, may, 26, a, short, time, later, the, alpenkorps, was, already, taking, part, in, combat, operations, against, italian, units, although, the, german, empire, was, not, officially, at, war, with, italy, until, august, 28, 1916, the, armeegruppe, rohr, stood, under, the, command, of, franz, rohr, von, denta, and, was, to, secure, the, carinthian, front, the, transfer, of, the, 5th, army, and, additional, troops, from, the, east, went, smoothly, within, a, few, weeks, archduke, eugen, had, around, 225, 000, soldiers, under, his, command, in, june, the, 48, division, fml, theodor, gabriel, and, finally, in, july, the, four, kaiserj, ger, regiments, and, three, k, k, landessch, tzen, regiments, from, galicia, were, added, a, major, advantage, of, the, austro, hungarian, defense, was, its, entrenchment, on, higher, ground, italy, ordered, general, mobilization, on, may, 22, 1915, and, by, the, end, of, june, four, armies, had, marched, into, the, north, east, border, area, in, the, deployment, plan, of, the, italian, general, staff, commando, supremo, under, the, direction, of, fm, luigi, cadorna, three, main, points, were, set, although, the, italian, armed, forces, were, numerically, superior, things, initially, remained, surprisingly, quiet, on, the, southwestern, front, no, attempt, was, made, to, break, through, on, the, tyrolean, front, and, there, was, no, major, offensive, on, the, isonzo, either, due, to, the, hesitant, implementation, of, cadorna, s, attack, plans, the, chance, to, score, the, decisive, blow, right, at, the, beginning, was, lost, fml, cletus, pichler, the, chief, of, staff, of, the, lvk, tirol, wrote, a, general, attack, on, the, most, important, penetration, points, such, as, the, stilfser, joch, etschtal, valsugana, rollepass, kreuzbergpass, could, have, led, to, significant, enemy, successes, in, view, of, the, extremely, weak, defense, forces, in, may, that, the, opportunity, for, a, quick, breakthrough, was, not, used, was, partly, due, to, the, slow, mobilization, of, the, italian, army, due, to, the, poorly, developed, transport, network, the, provision, of, troops, and, war, material, could, only, be, completed, in, mid, june, i, e, a, month, later, than, estimated, by, the, military, leadership, the, italian, army, also, suffered, from, many, shortcomings, on, the, structural, level, artillery, pieces, and, munitions, were, not, the, only, area, where, shortages, were, acute, in, august, 1914, the, italian, army, had, at, its, disposal, only, 750, 000, rifles, of, the, standard, carcano, 1891, model, and, no, hand, grenades, available, at, all, this, inadequate, supply, of, equipment, especially, limited, the, scope, and, efficiency, of, training, throughout, 1914, and, 1915, munitions, were, also, urgently, needed, in, july, 1914, only, ca, 700, rounds, were, available, per, rifle, despite, cadorna, s, demand, that, 2, 000, rounds, each, be, found, in, preparation, for, war, by, may, 1915, the, army, had, only, succeeded, in, procuring, 900, rounds, per, rifle, meanwhile, emilio, de, bono, records, that, throughout, 1915, hand, grenades, remained, unheard, of, in, the, trenches, italy, s, first, machine, guns, were, prototypes, as, the, perino, model, 1908, or, maxim, guns, acquired, in, 1913, from, the, british, manufacturer, vickers, in, line, with, the, 1911, plan, for, creating, 602, machine, gun, sections, by, august, 1914, only, 150, of, these, had, been, created, meaning, there, was, only, one, machine, gun, section, per, regiment, as, opposed, to, one, per, battalion, as, envisaged, in, the, plans, by, may, 1915, the, fiat, revelli, mod, 1914, became, the, standard, machine, gun, of, the, italian, army, and, a, total, of, 309, sections, had, been, created, with, 618, guns, in, total, though, this, was, an, improvement, it, was, still, only, half, the, planned, number, leaving, many, battalions, to, do, without, in, contrast, a, standard, k, u, k, regiment, had, four, machine, gun, sections, mg, 07, 12, schwarzlose, one, for, each, battalion, whilst, a, standard, british, regiment, had, by, february, 1915, four, machine, gun, sections, per, battalion, during, the, italo, turkish, war, in, libya, 1911, 1912, the, italian, military, suffered, equipment, and, munition, shortages, not, yet, repaired, before, italian, entry, into, the, great, war, at, the, opening, of, the, campaign, austro, hungarian, troops, occupied, and, fortified, high, ground, of, the, julian, alps, and, karst, plateau, but, the, italians, initially, outnumbered, their, opponents, three, to, one, an, italian, offensive, aimed, to, cross, the, so, a, isonzo, river, take, the, fortress, town, of, gorizia, and, then, enter, the, karst, plateau, this, offensive, opened, the, first, battles, of, the, isonzo, at, the, beginning, of, the, first, battle, of, the, isonzo, on, 23, june, 1915, italian, forces, outnumbered, the, austrians, three, to, one, but, failed, to, penetrate, the, strong, austro, hungarian, defensive, lines, in, the, highlands, of, northwestern, gorizia, and, gradisca, because, the, austrian, forces, occupied, higher, ground, italians, conducted, difficult, offensives, while, climbing, the, italian, forces, therefore, failed, to, drive, much, beyond, the, river, and, the, battle, ended, on, 7, july, 1915, despite, a, professional, officer, corps, severely, under, equipped, italian, units, lacked, morale, also, many, troops, deeply, disliked, the, newly, appointed, italian, commander, general, luigi, cadorna, moreover, preexisting, equipment, and, munition, shortages, slowed, progress, and, frustrated, all, expectations, for, a, napoleonic, style, breakout, like, most, contemporaneous, militaries, the, italian, army, primarily, used, horses, for, transport, but, struggled, and, sometimes, failed, to, supply, the, troops, sufficiently, in, the, tough, terrain, two, weeks, later, on, 18, july, 1915, the, italians, attempted, another, frontal, assault, against, the, austro, hungarian, trench, lines, with, more, artillery, in, the, second, battle, of, the, isonzo, in, the, northern, section, of, the, front, the, italians, managed, to, overrun, mount, batognica, over, kobarid, caporetto, which, would, have, an, important, strategic, value, in, future, battles, this, bloody, offensive, concluded, in, stalemate, when, both, sides, ran, out, of, ammunition, the, italians, recuperated, rearmed, with, 1200, heavy, guns, and, then, on, 18, october, 1915, launched, the, third, battle, of, the, isonzo, another, attack, forces, of, austria, hungary, repulsed, this, italian, offensive, which, concluded, on, 4, november, without, resulting, gains, the, italians, again, launched, another, offensive, on, 10, november, the, fourth, battle, of, the, isonzo, both, sides, suffered, more, casualties, but, the, italians, conquered, important, entrenchments, and, the, battle, ended, on, 2, december, for, exhaustion, of, armaments, but, occasional, skirmishing, persisted, after, the, winter, lull, the, italians, launched, the, fifth, battle, of, the, isonzo, on, 9, march, 1916, and, captured, the, strategic, mount, sabatino, but, austria, hungary, repulsed, all, other, attacks, and, the, battle, concluded, on, 16, march, in, poor, weather, for, trench, warfare, following, italy, s, stalemate, the, austro, hungarian, forces, began, planning, a, counteroffensive, battle, of, asiago, in, trentino, and, directed, over, the, plateau, of, altopiano, di, asiago, with, the, aim, to, break, through, to, the, po, river, plain, and, thus, cutting, off, the, 2nd, 3rd, and, 4th, italian, armies, in, the, north, east, of, the, country, the, offensive, began, on, 15, may, 1916, with, 15, divisions, and, resulted, in, initial, gains, but, then, the, italians, counterattacked, and, pushed, the, austro, hungarians, back, to, the, tyrol, later, in, 1916, four, more, battles, along, the, isonzo, river, erupted, the, sixth, battle, of, the, isonzo, launched, by, the, italians, in, august, resulted, in, a, success, greater, than, the, previous, attacks, the, offensive, gained, nothing, of, strategic, value, but, did, take, gorizia, which, boosted, italian, spirits, the, seventh, eighth, and, ninth, battles, of, the, isonzo, 14, september, 4, november, managed, to, accomplish, little, except, to, wear, down, the, already, exhausted, armies, of, both, nations, the, frequency, of, offensives, for, which, the, italian, soldiers, partook, between, may, 1915, and, august, 1917, one, every, three, months, was, higher, than, demanded, by, the, armies, on, the, western, front, italian, discipline, was, also, harsher, with, punishments, for, infractions, of, duty, of, a, severity, not, known, in, the, german, french, and, british, armies, shellfire, in, the, rocky, terrain, caused, 70, more, casualties, per, rounds, expended, than, on, the, soft, ground, in, belgium, and, france, by, the, autumn, of, 1917, the, italian, army, had, suffered, most, of, the, deaths, it, was, to, incur, during, the, war, yet, the, end, of, the, war, seemed, to, still, be, an, eternity, away, this, was, not, the, same, line, of, thought, for, the, austro, hungarians, on, 25, august, the, emperor, charles, wrote, to, the, kaiser, the, following, the, experience, we, have, acquired, in, the, eleventh, battle, has, led, me, to, believe, that, we, should, fare, far, worse, in, the, twelfth, my, commanders, and, brave, troops, have, decided, that, such, an, unfortunate, situation, might, be, anticipated, by, an, offensive, we, have, not, the, necessary, means, as, regards, troops, from, 1915, the, high, peaks, of, the, dolomites, range, were, an, area, of, fierce, mountain, warfare, in, order, to, protect, their, soldiers, from, enemy, fire, and, the, hostile, alpine, environment, both, austro, hungarian, and, italian, military, engineers, constructed, fighting, tunnels, which, offered, a, degree, of, cover, and, allowed, better, logistics, support, working, at, high, altitudes, in, the, hard, carbonate, rock, of, the, dolomites, often, in, exposed, areas, near, mountain, peaks, and, even, in, glacial, ice, required, extreme, skill, of, both, austro, hungarian, and, italian, miners, beginning, on, the, 13th, later, referred, to, as, white, friday, december, 1916, would, see, 10, 000, soldiers, on, both, sides, killed, by, avalanches, in, the, dolomites, numerous, avalanches, were, caused, by, the, italians, and, austro, hungarians, purposefully, firing, artillery, shells, on, the, mountainside, while, others, were, naturally, caused, in, addition, to, building, underground, shelters, and, covered, supply, routes, for, their, soldiers, like, the, italian, strada, delle, 52, gallerie, both, sides, also, attempted, to, break, the, stalemate, of, trench, warfare, by, tunneling, under, no, man, s, land, and, placing, explosive, charges, beneath, the, enemy, s, positions, between, 1, january, 1916, and, 13, march, 1918, austro, hungarian, and, italian, units, fired, a, total, of, 34, mines, in, this, theatre, of, the, war, focal, points, of, the, underground, fighting, were, pasubio, with, 10, mines, lagazuoi, with, 5, col, di, lana, monte, sief, also, with, 5, and, marmolada, with, 4, mines, the, explosive, charges, ranged, from, 110, to, 50, 000, kilograms, 240, 110, 230, pounds, of, blasting, gelatin, in, april, 1916, the, italians, detonated, explosives, under, the, peaks, of, col, di, lana, killing, numerous, austro, hungarians, the, italians, directed, a, two, pronged, attack, against, the, austrian, lines, north, and, east, of, gorizia, the, austrians, checked, the, advance, east, but, italian, forces, under, luigi, capello, managed, to, break, the, austrian, lines, and, capture, the, banj, ice, plateau, characteristic, of, nearly, every, other, theater, of, the, war, the, italians, found, themselves, on, the, verge, of, victory, but, could, not, secure, it, because, their, supply, lines, could, not, keep, up, with, the, front, line, troops, and, they, were, forced, to, withdraw, however, the, italians, despite, suffering, heavy, casualties, had, almost, exhausted, and, defeated, the, austro, hungarian, army, on, the, front, forcing, them, to, call, in, german, help, for, the, much, anticipated, caporetto, offensive, the, austro, hungarians, received, desperately, needed, reinforcements, after, the, eleventh, battle, of, the, isonzo, from, german, army, soldiers, rushed, in, after, the, russian, offensive, ordered, by, kerensky, of, july, 1917, failed, also, arrived, german, troops, from, romanian, front, after, the, battle, of, m, r, e, ti, the, germans, introduced, infiltration, tactics, to, the, austro, hungarian, front, and, helped, work, on, a, new, offensive, meanwhile, mutinies, and, plummeting, morale, crippled, the, italian, army, from, within, the, soldiers, lived, in, poor, conditions, and, engaged, in, attack, after, attack, that, often, yielded, minimal, or, no, military, gain, on, 24, october, 1917, the, austro, hungarians, and, germans, launched, the, battle, of, caporetto, italian, name, for, kobarid, or, karfreit, in, german, chlorine, arsenic, agent, and, diphosgene, gas, shells, were, fired, as, part, of, a, huge, artillery, barrage, followed, by, infantry, using, infiltration, tactics, bypassing, enemy, strong, points, and, attacking, on, the, italian, rear, at, the, end, of, the, first, day, the, italians, had, retreated, 19, kilometres, 12, miles, to, the, tagliamento, river, when, the, austro, hungarian, offensive, routed, the, italians, the, new, italian, chief, of, staff, armando, diaz, ordered, to, stop, their, retreat, and, defend, the, fortified, defenses, around, the, monte, grappa, summit, between, the, roncone, and, the, tomatico, mountains, although, numerically, inferior, 51, 000, against, 120, 000, the, italian, army, managed, to, halt, the, austro, hungarian, and, german, armies, in, the, first, battle, of, monte, grappa, advancing, deep, and, fast, the, austro, hungarians, outran, their, supply, lines, which, forced, them, to, stop, and, regroup, the, italians, pushed, back, to, defensive, lines, near, venice, on, the, piave, river, had, suffered, 600, 000, casualties, to, this, point, in, the, war, because, of, these, losses, the, italian, government, called, to, arms, the, so, called, 99, boys, ragazzi, del, 99, the, new, class, of, conscripts, born, in, 1899, who, were, turning, 18, in, 1917, in, november, 1917, british, and, french, troops, started, to, bolster, the, front, line, from, the, 5, and, 6, divisions, respectively, provided, far, more, decisive, to, the, war, effort, than, their, troops, was, the, allies, economic, assistance, by, providing, strategic, materials, steel, coal, and, crops, provided, by, the, british, but, imported, from, argentina, etc, which, italy, always, lacked, sorely, in, the, spring, of, 1918, germany, pulled, out, its, troops, for, use, in, its, upcoming, spring, offensive, on, the, western, front, as, a, result, of, the, spring, offensive, britain, and, france, also, pulled, half, of, their, divisions, back, to, the, western, front, the, austro, hungarians, now, began, debating, how, to, finish, the, war, in, italy, the, austro, hungarian, generals, disagreed, on, how, to, administer, the, final, offensive, archduke, joseph, august, of, austria, decided, for, a, two, pronged, offensive, where, it, would, prove, impossible, for, the, two, forces, to, communicate, in, the, mountains, the, second, battle, of, the, piave, river, began, with, a, diversionary, attack, near, the, tonale, pass, named, lawine, which, the, italians, repulsed, after, two, days, of, fighting, austrian, deserters, betrayed, the, objectives, of, the, upcoming, offensive, which, allowed, the, italians, to, move, two, armies, directly, in, the, path, of, the, austrian, prongs, the, other, prong, led, by, general, svetozar, boroevi, von, bojna, initially, experienced, success, until, aircraft, bombed, their, supply, lines, and, italian, reinforcements, arrived, to, the, disappointment, of, italy,

proclaimed, their, independence, and, parts, of, their, troops, started, deserting, disobeying, orders, and, retreating, many, czechoslovak, troops, in, fact, started, working, for, the, allied, cause, and, in, september, 1918, five, czechoslovak, regiments, were, formed, in, the, italian, army, by, october, 1918, italy, finally, had, enough, soldiers, to, mount, an, offensive, the, attack, targeted, vittorio, veneto, across, the, piave, the, italian, army, broke, through, a, gap, near, sacile, and, poured, in, reinforcements, that, crushed, the, austro, hungarian, defensive, line, on,
