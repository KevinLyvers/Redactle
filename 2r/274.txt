as, there, is, a, river, with, a, ford, nearby, the, first, documented, use, of, the, name, by, the, dynasty, itself, has, been, traced, to, the, year, 1108, the, habsburg, name, was, not, continuously, used, by, the, family, members, since, they, often, emphasized, their, more, prestigious, princely, titles, the, dynasty, was, thus, long, known, as, the, house, of, austria,

the, habsburgs, had, made, their, own, at, times, impaled, with, the, arms, of, the, duchy, of, burgundy, ancient, after, maria, theresa, married, duke, francis, stephen, of, lorraine, the, idea, of, habsburg, as, associated, with, ancestral, austrian, rulership, was, used, to, show, that, the, old, dynasty, continued, as, did, all, its, inherited, rights, some, younger, sons, who, had, no, prospects, of, the, throne, were, given, the, personal, title, of, count, of, habsburg, the, surname, of, more, recent, members, of, the, family, such, as, otto, von, habsburg, and, karl, von,

derives, his, grandson, radbot, of, klettgau, founded, the, habsburg, castle, that, castle, was, the, family, seat, during, most, of, the, 11th, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, giovanni, thomas, marnavich, in, his, book, regiae, sanctitatis, illyricanae, faecunditas, dedicated, to, ferdinand, iii, wrote, that, the, house, of, habsburg, is, descended, from, the, roman, emperor, constantine,

with, the, georgenberg, pact, of, 1286, rudolph, secured, for, his, family, the, duchies, of, austria, and, styria, the, southern, portions, of, ottokar, s, former, realm, carinthia, carniola, and, savinja, went, to, rudolph, s, allies, from, the, house, of, gorizia, following, rudolph, s, death, in, 1291, albert, i, s, assassination, in, 1308, and, frederick, the, fair, s, failure, to, secure, the, german, imperial, crown, for, himself, the, habsburgs, temporarily, lost, their, supremacy, in, the, empire, in, the, early, 14th, century, they, also, focused, on, the, kingdom, of, bohemia, after, v, clav, iii, s, death, on, 4, august, 1306, there, were, no, male, heirs, remaining, in, the, p, emyslid, dynasty, habsburg, scion, rudolph, i, was, then, elected, but, only, lasted, a, year, the, bohemian, kingship, was, an, elected, position, and, the, habsburgs, were, only, able, to, secure, it, on, a, hereditary, basis, much, later, in, 1626, following, their, reconquest, of, the, czech, lands, during, the, thirty, years, war, after, 1307, subsequent, habsburg, attempts, to, gain, the, bohemian, crown, were, frustrated, first, by, henry, of, bohemia, a, member, of, the, house, of, gorizia, and, then, by, the, house, of, luxembourg, instead, they, were, able, to, expand, southwards, in, 1311, they, took, over, savinja, after, the, death, of, henry, in, 1335, they, assumed, power, in, carniola, and, carinthia, and, in, 1369, they, succeeded, his, daughter, margaret, in, tyrol, after, the, death, of, albert, iii, of, gorizia, in, 1374, they, gained, a, foothold, at, pazin, in, central, istria, followed, by, trieste, in, 1382, meanwhile, the, original, home, territories, of, the, habsburgs, in, what, is, now, switzerland, including, the, aargau, with, habsburg, castle, were, lost, in, the, 14th, century, to, the, expanding, swiss, confederacy, after, the, battles, of, morgarten, 1315, and, sempach, 1386, habsburg, castle, itself, was, finally, lost, to, the, swiss, in, 1415, rudolf, iv, s, brothers, albert, iii, and, leopold, iii, ignored, his, efforts, to, preserve, the, integrity, of, the, family, domains, and, enacted, the, separation, of, the, so, called, albertinian, and, leopoldian, family, lines, on, 25, september, 1379, by, the, treaty, of, neuberg, the, former, would, maintain, austria, proper, then, called, nieder, sterreich, but, comprising, modern, lower, austria, and, most, of, upper, austria, while, the, latter, would, rule, over, lands, then, labeled, ober, sterreich, namely, inner, austria, inner, sterreich, comprising, styria, carinthia, and, carniola, and, further, austria, vorder, sterreich, consisting, of, tyrol, and, the, western, habsburg, lands, in, alsace, and, swabia, by, marrying, elisabeth, of, luxembourg, the, daughter, of, emperor, sigismund, in, 1437, duke, albert, v, of, the, albertine, line, 1397, 1439, became, the, ruler, of, bohemia, and, hungary, again, expanding, the, family, s, political, horizons, the, next, year, albert, was, crowned, king, of, the, romans, known, as, such, as, albert, ii, following, his, early, death, in, a, battle, against, the, ottomans, in, 1439, and, that, of, his, son, ladislaus, postumus, in, 1457, the, habsburgs, lost, bohemia, once, more, as, well, as, hungary, for, several, decades, however, with, the, extinction, of, the, house, of, celje, in, 1456, and, the, house, of, wallsee, enns, in, 1466, 1483, they, managed, to, absorb, significant, secular, enclaves, into, their, territories, and, create, a, contiguous, domain, stretching, from, the, border, with, bohemia, to, the, adriatic, sea, after, the, death, of, leopold, s, eldest, son, william, in, 1406, the, leopoldian, line, was, further, split, among, his, brothers, into, the, inner, austrian, territory, under, ernest, the, iron, and, a, tyrolean, further, austrian, line, under, frederick, of, the, empty, pockets, in, 1440, ernest, s, son, frederick, iii, was, chosen, by, the, electoral, college, to, succeed, albert, ii, as, the, king, several, habsburg, kings, had, attempted, to, gain, the, imperial, dignity, over, the, years, but, success, finally, arrived, on, 19, march, 1452, when, pope, nicholas, v, crowned, frederick, iii, as, the, holy, roman, emperor, in, a, grand, ceremony, held, in, rome, in, frederick, iii, the, pope, found, an, important, political, ally, with, whose, help, he, was, able, to, counter, the, conciliar, movement, while, in, rome, frederick, iii, married, eleanor, of, portugal, enabling, him, to, build, a, network, of, connections, with, dynasties, in, the, west, and, southeast, of, europe, frederick, was, rather, distant, to, his, family, eleanor, by, contrast, had, a, great, influence, on, the, raising, and, education, of, frederick, s, children, and, therefore, played, an, important, role, in, the, family, s, rise, to, prominence, after, frederick, iii, s, coronation, the, habsburgs, were, able, to, hold, the, imperial, throne, almost, continuously, until, 1806, through, the, forged, document, called, privilegium, maius, 1358, 59, rudolf, iv, duke, of, austria, 1339, 1365, introduced, the, title, of, archduke, to, place, the, habsburgs, on, a, par, with, the, prince, electors, of, the, empire, since, emperor, charles, iv, had, omitted, to, give, them, the, electoral, dignity, in, his, golden, bull, of, 1356, charles, however, refused, to, recognize, the, title, as, did, his, immediate, successors, duke, ernest, the, iron, and, his, descendants, unilaterally, assumed, the, title, archduke, that, title, was, only, officially, recognized, in, 1453, by, emperor, frederick, iii, the, ruler, of, austria, himself, frederick, himself, used, just, duke, of, austria, never, archduke, until, his, death, in, 1493, the, title, was, first, granted, to, frederick, s, younger, brother, albert, vi, of, austria, died, 1463, who, used, it, at, least, from, 1458, in, 1477, frederick, granted, the, title, archduke, to, his, first, cousin, sigismund, of, austria, ruler, of, further, austria, frederick, s, son, and, heir, the, future, maximilian, i, holy, roman, emperor, apparently, only, started, to, use, the, title, after, the, death, of, his, wife, mary, of, burgundy, in, 1482, as, archduke, never, appears, in, documents, issued, jointly, by, maximilian, and, mary, as, rulers, in, the, low, countries, where, maximilian, is, still, titled, duke, of, austria, the, title, appears, first, in, documents, issued, under, the, joint, rule, of, maximilian, and, philip, his, under, age, son, in, the, low, countries, archduke, was, initially, borne, by, those, dynasts, who, ruled, a, habsburg, territory, i, e, only, by, males, and, their, consorts, appanages, being, commonly, distributed, to, cadets, these, junior, archdukes, did, not, thereby, become, independent, hereditary, rulers, since, all, territories, remained, vested, in, the, austrian, crown, occasionally, a, territory, might, be, combined, with, a, separate, gubernatorial, mandate, ruled, by, an, archducal, cadet, from, the, 16th, century, onward, archduke, and, its, female, form, archduchess, came, to, be, used, by, all, the, members, of, the, house, of, habsburg, e, g, queen, marie, antoinette, of, france, was, born, archduchess, maria, antonia, of, austria, in, 1457, duke, frederick, v, of, inner, austria, also, gained, the, austrian, archduchy, after, his, albertine, cousin, ladislaus, the, posthumous, had, died, without, issue, 1490, saw, the, reunification, of, all, habsburg, lines, when, archduke, sigismund, of, further, austria, and, tyrol, resigned, in, favor, of, frederick, s, son, maximilian, i, as, emperor, frederick, iii, took, a, leading, role, in, the, family, and, positioned, himself, as, the, judge, over, the, family, s, internal, conflicts, often, making, use, of, the, privilegium, maius, he, was, able, to, restore, the, unity, of, the, house, s, austrian, lands, since, the, albertinian, line, was, now, extinct, territorial, integrity, was, also, strengthened, by, the, extinction, of, the, tyrolean, branch, of, the, leopoldian, line, frederick, s, aim, was, to, make, austria, a, united, country, stretching, from, the, rhine, to, the, mur, and, leitha, externally, one, of, frederick, s, main, achievements, was, the, siege, of, neuss, 1474, 75, in, which, he, coerced, charles, the, bold, of, burgundy, to, give, his, daughter, mary, of, burgundy, as, wife, to, frederick, s, son, maximilian, the, wedding, took, place, on, the, evening, of, 16, august, 1477, and, ultimately, resulted, in, the, habsburgs, acquiring, control, of, the, burgundian, netherlands, after, mary, s, early, death, in, 1482, maximilian, attempted, to, secure, the, burgundian, inheritance, for, one, of, his, and, mary, s, children, philip, the, handsome, charles, viii, of, france, contested, this, using, both, military, and, dynastic, means, but, the, burgundian, succession, was, finally, ruled, in, favor, of, philip, in, the, treaty, of, senlis, in, 1493, after, the, death, of, his, father, in, 1493, maximilian, was, proclaimed, the, new, king, of, germany, as, maximilian, i, maximilian, was, initially, unable, to, travel, to, rome, to, receive, the, imperial, title, from, the, pope, owing, to, opposition, from, venice, and, from, the, french, who, were, occupying, milan, as, well, a, refusal, from, the, pope, owing, to, enemy, forces, being, present, on, his, territory, in, 1508, maximilian, proclaimed, himself, to, be, the, chosen, emperor, and, this, was, also, recognized, by, the, pope, owing, to, changes, in, political, alliances, this, had, the, consequence, of, the, roman, king, automatically, becoming, emperor, without, needing, the, pope, s, consent, emperor, charles, v, would, be, the, last, to, be, crowned, by, the, pope, himself, at, bologna, in, 1530, maximilian, s, rule, 1493, 1519, was, a, time, of, dramatic, expansion, for, the, habsburgs, in, 1497, maximilian, s, son, philip, known, as, the, handsome, or, the, fair, married, joanna, of, castile, also, known, as, joanna, the, mad, heiress, of, castile, and, aragon, phillip, and, joan, had, six, children, the, eldest, of, whom, became, emperor, charles, v, in, 1516, and, ruled, the, kingdoms, of, castile, and, aragon, including, their, colonies, in, the, new, world, southern, italy, austria, and, the, habsburg, netherlands, with, his, mother, and, nominal, coruler, joanna, who, was, kept, under, confinement, the, foundations, for, the, later, empire, of, austria, hungary, were, laid, in, 1515, by, a, double, wedding, between, louis, only, son, of, vladislaus, ii, king, of, bohemia, and, hungary, and, maximilian, s, granddaughter, mary, and, between, her, brother, archduke, ferdinand, and, louis, s, sister, anna, the, wedding, was, celebrated, in, grand, style, on, 22, july, 1515, all, these, children, were, still, minors, so, the, wedding, was, formally, completed, in, 1521, vladislaus, died, on, 13, march, 1516, and, maximilian, on, 12, january, 1519, but, the, latter, s, designs, were, ultimately, successful, on, louis, s, death, in, battle, in, 1526, ferdinand, became, king, of, bohemia, and, hungary, the, habsburg, dynasty, achieved, its, highest, position, when, charles, v, was, elected, holy, roman, emperor, in, 1519, much, of, charles, s, reign, was, dedicated, to, the, fight, against, protestantism, which, led, to, its, eradication, throughout, vast, areas, under, habsburg, control, charles, formally, became, the, sole, monarch, of, spain, upon, the, death, of, his, imprisoned, mother, queen, joan, in, 1555, after, the, abdication, of, charles, v, in, 1556, the, habsburg, dynasty, split, into, the, branch, of, the, austrian, or, german, habsburgs, led, by, ferdinand, and, the, branch, of, the, spanish, habsburgs, initially, led, by, charles, s, son, philip, ferdinand, i, king, of, bohemia, hungary, and, archduke, of, austria, in, the, name, of, his, brother, charles, v, became, suo, jure, monarch, as, well, as, the, habsburg, holy, roman, emperor, designated, as, successor, already, in, 1531, philip, became, king, of, spain, and, its, colonial, empire, as, philip, ii, and, ruler, of, the, habsburg, domains, in, italy, and, the, low, countries, the, spanish, habsburgs, also, ruled, portugal, for, a, time, known, there, as, the, philippine, dynasty, 1580, 1640, the, seventeen, provinces, and, the, duchy, of, milan, were, in, personal, union, under, the, king, of, spain, but, remained, part, of, the, holy, roman, empire, furthermore, the, spanish, king, had, claims, on, hungary, and, bohemia, in, the, secret, o, ate, treaty, of, 29, july, 1617, the, spanish, and, austrian, habsburgs, settled, their, mutual, claims, the, habsburgs, sought, to, consolidate, their, power, by, frequent, consanguineous, marriages, resulting, in, a, cumulatively, deleterious, effect, on, their, gene, pool, health, impairments, due, to, inbreeding, included, epilepsy, insanity, and, early, death, a, study, of, 3, 000, family, members, over, 16, generations, by, the, university, of, santiago, de, compostela, suggests, inbreeding, may, have, played, a, role, in, their, extinction, numerous, members, of, the, family, showed, specific, facial, deformities, an, enlarged, lower, jaw, with, an, extended, chin, known, as, mandibular, prognathism, or, habsburg, jaw, a, large, nose, with, hump, and, hanging, tip, habsburg, nose, and, an, everted, lower, lip, habsburg, lip, the, last, two, are, signs, of, maxillary, deficiency, a, 2019, study, found, that, the, degree, of, mandibular, prognathism, in, the, habsburg, family, shows, a, statistically, significant, correlation, with, the, degree, of, inbreeding, a, correlation, between, maxillary, deficiency, and, degree, of, inbreeding, was, also, present, but, was, not, statistically, significant, other, scientific, studies, however, dispute, the, ideas, of, any, linkage, between, fertility, and, consanguinity, the, gene, pool, eventually, became, so, small, that, the, last, of, the, spanish, line, charles, ii, who, was, severely, disabled, from, birth, perhaps, by, genetic, disorders, possessed, a, genome, comparable, to, that, of, a, child, born, to, a, brother, and, sister, as, did, his, father, probably, because, of, remote, inbreeding, the, death, of, charles, ii, of, spain, in, 1700, led, to, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, and, that, of, emperor, charles, vi, in, 1740, to, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, the, former, was, won, by, house, of, bourbon, putting, an, end, to, habsburg, rule, in, spain, the, latter, however, was, won, by, maria, theresa, and, led, to, the, succession, of, the, house, of, habsburg, lorraine, german, haus, habsburg, lothringen, becoming, the, new, main, branch, of, the, dynasty, in, the, person, of, maria, theresa, s, son, joseph, ii, this, new, house, was, created, by, the, marriage, between, maria, theresa, and, francis, stephan, duke, of, lorraine, both, of, them, were, great, grandchildren, of, habsburg, emperor, ferdinand, iii, but, from, different, empresses, this, new, house, was, a, cadet, branch, of, the, female, line, of, the, house, of, habsburg, and, the, male, line, of, the, house, of, lorraine, on, 6, august, 1806, emperor, francis, i, dissolved, the, holy, roman, empire, under, pressure, from, napoleon, s, reorganization, of, germany, in, anticipation, of, the, loss, of, his, title, of, holy, roman, emperor, francis, had, declared, himself, hereditary, emperor, of, austria, as, francis, i, on, 11, august, 1804, three, months, after, napoleon, had, declared, himself, emperor, of, the, french, on, 18, may, 1804, emperor, francis,
