cahokia, mounds, k, h, o, k, i, 11, ms, 2, is, the, site, of, a, pre, columbian, native, american, city, which, existed, c, 1050, 1350, ce, directly, across, the, mississippi, river, from, present, day, st, louis, the, state, archaeology, park, lies, in, south, western, illinois, between, east, st, louis, and, collinsville, the, park, covers, 2, 200, acres, 890, ha, or, about, 3, 5, square, miles, 9, km, 2, and, contains, about, 80, manmade, mounds, but, the, ancient, city, was, much, larger, at, its, apex, around, 1100, ce, the, city, covered, about, 6, square, miles, 16, km, 2, included, about, 120, earthworks, in, a, wide, range, of, sizes, shapes, and, functions, and, had, a, population, of, between, 15, 000, and, 20, 000, people, cahokia, was, the, largest, and, most, influential, urban, settlement, of, the, mississippian, culture, which, developed, advanced, societies, across, much, of, what, is, now, the, central, and, the, southeastern, united, states, beginning, more, than, 1, 000, years, before, european, contact, today, the, cahokia, mounds, are, considered, to, be, the, largest, and, most, complex, archaeological, site, north, of, the, great, pre, columbian, cities, in, mexico, cahokia, mounds, is, a, national, historic, landmark, and, a, designated, site, for, state, protection, it, is, also, one, of, the, 25, unesco, world, heritage, sites, within, the, united, states, the, largest, pre, columbian, earthen, construction, in, the, americas, north, of, mexico, the, site, is, open, to, the, public, and, administered, by, the, illinois, historic, preservation, division, and, supported, by, the, cahokia, mounds, museum, society, in, celebration, of, the, 2018, illinois, state, bicentennial, the, cahokia, mounds, were, selected, as, one, of, the, illinois, 200, great, places, by, the, american, institute, of, architects, illinois, component, aia, illinois, it, was, recognized, by, usa, today, travel, magazine, as, one, of, the, selections, for, illinois, 25, must, see, places, although, some, evidence, exists, of, occupation, during, the, late, archaic, period, around, 1200, bce, in, and, around, the, site, cahokia, as, it, is, now, defined, was, settled, around, 600, ce, during, the, late, woodland, period, mound, building, at, this, location, began, with, the, emergent, mississippian, cultural, period, around, the, 9th, century, ce, the, inhabitants, left, no, written, records, beyond, symbols, on, pottery, marine, shell, copper, wood, and, stone, but, the, elaborately, planned, community, woodhenge, mounds, and, burials, reveal, a, complex, and, sophisticated, society, the, city, s, complex, construction, of, earthen, mounds, required, digging, excavation, and, transportation, by, hand, using, woven, baskets, construction, made, use, of, 55, million, cubic, feet, 1, 6, million, cubic, meters, of, earth, and, much, of, the, work, was, accomplished, over, decades, its, highly, planned, large, smoothed, flat, ceremonial, plazas, sited, around, the, mounds, with, homes, for, thousands, connected, by, laid, out, pathways, and, courtyards, suggest, the, location, served, as, a, central, religious, pilgrimage, city, the, city, s, original, name, is, unknown, the, mounds, were, later, named, after, the, cahokia, tribe, a, historic, illiniwek, people, living, in, the, area, when, the, first, french, explorers, arrived, in, the, 17th, century, as, this, was, centuries, after, cahokia, was, abandoned, by, its, original, inhabitants, the, cahokia, tribe, was, not, necessarily, descended, from, the, earlier, mississippian, era, people, most, likely, multiple, indigenous, ethnic, groups, settled, in, the, cahokia, mounds, area, during, the, time, of, the, city, s, apex, historian, daniel, richter, notes, that, the, apex, of, the, city, occurred, during, the, medieval, warming, period, this, period, appears, to, have, fostered, an, agricultural, revolution, in, upper, north, america, as, the, three, fold, crops, of, maize, beans, legumes, and, gourds, squash, were, developed, and, adapted, or, bred, to, the, temperate, climates, of, the, north, from, their, origins, in, mesoamerica, richter, also, notes, that, cahokia, s, advanced, development, coincided, with, the, development, in, the, southwest, of, the, chaco, canyon, society, which, also, produced, large, scale, works, in, an, apparent, socially, stratified, society, the, decline, of, the, city, coincides, with, the, little, ice, age, although, by, then, the, three, fold, agriculture, remained, well, established, throughout, temperate, north, america, cahokia, became, the, most, important, center, for, the, mississippian, culture, this, culture, was, expressed, in, settlements, that, ranged, along, major, waterways, across, what, is, now, the, midwest, eastern, and, southeastern, united, states, cahokia, was, located, in, a, strategic, position, near, the, confluence, of, the, mississippi, missouri, and, illinois, rivers, it, maintained, trade, links, with, communities, as, far, away, as, the, great, lakes, to, the, north, and, the, gulf, coast, to, the, south, trading, in, such, exotic, items, as, copper, mill, creek, chert, shark, teeth, and, lightning, whelk, shells, mill, creek, chert, most, notably, was, used, in, the, production, of, hoes, a, high, demand, tool, for, farmers, around, cahokia, and, other, mississippian, centers, cahokia, s, control, of, the, manufacture, and, distribution, of, these, hand, tools, was, an, important, economic, activity, that, allowed, the, city, to, thrive, mississippian, culture, pottery, and, stone, tools, in, the, cahokian, style, were, found, at, the, silvernale, site, near, red, wing, minnesota, and, materials, and, trade, goods, from, pennsylvania, the, gulf, coast, and, lake, superior, have, been, excavated, at, cahokia, at, the, high, point, of, its, development, cahokia, was, the, largest, urban, center, north, of, the, great, mesoamerican, cities, in, mexico, and, central, america, home, to, about, 1, 000, people, before, circa, 1050, its, population, grew, rapidly, after, that, date, according, to, a, 2007, study, in, quaternary, science, reviews, between, ad, 1050, and, 1100, cahokia, s, population, increased, from, between, 1, 400, and, 2, 800, people, to, between, 10, 200, and, 15, 300, people, an, estimate, that, applies, only, to, a, 1, 8, square, kilometre, 0, 69, sq, mi, high, density, central, occupation, area, studies, of, cahokia, s, rise, see, large, scale, immigration, as, an, essential, contributor, to, the, city, s, initial, rapid, growth, archaeologists, estimate, the, city, s, population, at, between, 6, 000, and, 40, 000, at, its, peak, with, more, people, living, in, outlying, farming, villages, that, supplied, the, main, urban, center, as, a, result, of, archeological, excavations, in, the, early, 21st, century, new, residential, areas, were, found, to, the, west, of, cahokia, this, discovery, increased, estimates, of, historic, area, population, if, the, highest, population, estimates, are, correct, cahokia, was, larger, than, any, subsequent, city, in, the, united, states, until, the, 1780s, when, philadelphia, s, population, grew, beyond, 40, 000, its, population, may, have, been, larger, than, contemporaneous, london, and, paris, one, of, the, major, problems, that, large, centers, like, cahokia, faced, was, keeping, a, steady, supply, of, food, perhaps, exacerbated, by, droughts, from, ce, 1100, 1250, a, related, problem, was, waste, disposal, for, the, dense, population, and, cahokia, is, believed, to, have, become, unhealthy, from, polluted, waterways, because, it, was, such, an, unhealthy, place, to, live, snow, believes, that, the, town, had, to, rely, on, social, and, political, attractions, to, bring, in, a, steady, supply, of, new, immigrants, otherwise, the, town, s, death, rate, would, have, caused, it, to, be, abandoned, earlier, the, population, of, cahokia, began, to, decline, during, the, 13th, century, and, the, site, was, abandoned, by, around, 1350, scholars, have, proposed, environmental, factors, such, as, environmental, degradation, through, overhunting, deforestation, and, pollution, and, climatic, changes, such, as, increased, flooding, and, droughts, as, explanations, for, abandonment, of, the, site, however, more, recent, research, suggests, that, there, is, no, evidence, of, human, caused, erosion, or, flooding, at, cahokia, political, economic, or, cultural, problems, may, also, have, contributed, to, the, community, s, decline, thomas, emerson, and, kristin, hedman, argue, that, cahokia, s, large, immigrant, population, was, a, factor, in, the, city, s, ultimate, fragmentation, as, differing, languages, customs, and, religions, obstructed, the, creation, of, a, cohesive, cahokian, cultural, identity, analyses, of, cahokian, burial, sites, and, the, associated, remains, have, also, shown, that, many, cahokians, were, not, native, to, the, city, or, its, immediate, surrounding, region, these, immigrants, were, sometimes, buried, separately, from, native, residents, a, possible, indicator, of, weak, integration, along, ethnic, lines, it, is, likely, that, social, and, environmental, factors, combined, to, produce, the, conditions, that, led, people, to, leave, cahokia, another, possible, cause, is, invasion, by, outside, peoples, many, theories, since, the, late, 20th, century, propose, conquest, induced, political, collapse, as, the, primary, reason, for, cahokia, s, abandonment, evidence, of, warfare, found, is, defensive, wooden, stockade, and, watchtowers, that, enclosed, cahokia, s, main, ceremonial, precinct, however, the, palisade, may, have, been, more, for, ritual, or, formal, separation, than, for, military, purposes, but, bastioned, palisades, almost, always, indicate, warfare, as, cahokia, s, population, shrank, over, the, 13th, century, cahokia, s, palisade, was, rebuilt, several, times, to, encompass, increasingly, smaller, portions, of, the, city, diseases, transmitted, among, the, large, dense, urban, population, are, another, possible, cause, of, decline, similarly, health, issues, like, pellagra, are, known, to, arise, through, maize, intense, diets, like, cahokia, s, however, evidence, tying, nutritional, deficiencies, to, a, broader, societal, collapse, has, not, been, conclusively, identified, at, cahokia, s, beginning, around, ce, 1050, hominy, was, made, though, nixtamalization, that, made, the, maize, more, nutritious, recent, research, indicates, that, early, cahokians, nixtamalized, maize, but, then, stopped, nixtamalizing, maize, around, ce, 1200, intense, reliance, on, maize, that, is, not, nixtamalized, may, result, in, pellagra, and, death, isotope, analysis, of, burial, remains, at, cahokia, has, revealed, iron, deficiency, anemia, and, tooth, enamel, defects, potentially, stemming, from, cahokia, s, reliance, on, maize, together, with, these, factors, researchers, found, evidence, in, 2015, of, major, floods, at, cahokia, so, severe, as, to, flood, dwelling, places, analysis, of, sediment, from, beneath, horseshoe, lake, has, revealed, that, two, major, floods, occurred, in, the, period, of, settlement, at, cahokia, in, roughly, 1100, 1260, and, 1340, 1460, while, flooding, may, have, occurred, early, in, the, rise, of, the, city, it, seems, not, to, have, deterred, the, city, builders, to, the, contrary, it, appears, they, took, steps, such, as, creating, channels, dikes, and, levees, that, protected, at, least, the, central, city, throughout, its, inhabited, history, in, another, indication, of, flood, mitigation, efforts, cahokians, dispersed, their, agricultural, lands, among, both, lowland, and, upland, fields, thereby, reducing, the, chances, that, a, single, cataclysmic, flood, would, wipe, out, the, city, s, food, supply, archeologists, discovered, evidence, in, 2020, that, there, was, a, population, rebound, in, the, greater, area, following, cahokia, s, population, minimum, in, 1400, with, the, population, reaching, a, population, maximum, in, 1650, and, then, declining, again, in, 1700, cahokia, was, surrounded, by, rich, agricultural, lands, the, city, has, been, traditionally, thought, to, have, been, a, maize, centric, civilization, the, crop, having, been, introduced, to, the, region, around, ad, 900, while, maize, is, often, credited, with, enabling, cahokia, s, early, population, growth, more, recent, research, has, suggested, that, cahokian, diets, were, quite, varied, especially, in, the, city, s, early, period, of, existence, thomas, emerson, and, kristin, hedman, attribute, the, discovery, of, cahokian, individuals, with, low, maize, diets, to, the, existence, of, hunter, gatherer, immigrant, communities, who, had, not, yet, adopted, maize, as, a, staple, food, source, residents, of, outlying, areas, relied, heavily, on, maize, for, subsistence, while, residents, of, cahokia, s, city, center, enjoyed, more, diverse, diets, one, interpretation, is, that, higher, levels, of, maize, consumption, may, be, correlated, with, a, lower, social, status, among, cahokian, residents, the, impact, that, cahokian, agriculture, had, on, the, environment, and, its, relationship, to, the, city, s, ultimate, collapse, is, hotly, debated, the, depletion, of, farming, soil, surrounding, cahokia, may, have, led, to, a, decline, in, food, resources, that, doomed, the, city, jane, mt, pleasant, however, argues, that, these, models, of, cahokia, s, soil, longevity, are, flawed, because, it, is, based, on, modern, understandings, of, crop, yields, that, assume, the, use, of, plows, cahokians, exclusive, use, of, hand, tools, was, less, damaging, to, the, soil, and, thus, may, have, maintained, soil, quality, far, longer, than, is, typical, today, making, a, rapid, collapse, of, agricultural, productivity, in, cahokia, less, likely, the, original, site, contained, 120, earthen, mounds, over, an, area, of, 6, square, miles, 16, km, 2, of, which, 80, remain, today, to, achieve, that, thousands, of, workers, over, decades, moved, more, than, an, estimated, 55, million, cubic, feet, 1, 600, 000, m, 3, of, earth, in, woven, baskets, to, create, this, network, of, mounds, and, community, plazas, monks, mound, for, example, covers, 14, acres, 5, 7, ha, rises, 100, ft, 30, m, and, was, topped, by, a, massive, 5, 000, sq, ft, 460, m, 2, building, another, 50, ft, 15, m, high, early, in, its, history, cahokia, underwent, a, massive, construction, boom, along, with, the, early, phase, of, monks, mound, an, overarching, urban, layout, was, established, at, the, site, it, was, built, with, a, symbolic, quadripartite, worldview, and, oriented, toward, the, four, cardinal, directions, with, the, main, east, west, and, north, south, axes, defined, with, monks, mound, near, its, center, point, four, large, plazas, were, established, to, the, east, west, north, and, south, of, monks, mound, to, the, south, of, monks, mound, is, the, grand, plaza, a, large, area, that, covered, roughly, 50, acres, 20, ha, and, measured, over, 1, 600, ft, 490, m, in, length, by, over, 900, ft, 270, m, in, width, researchers, originally, thought, the, flat, open, terrain, in, this, area, reflected, cahokia, s, location, on, the, mississippi, s, alluvial, flood, plain, but, instead, soil, studies, have, shown, that, the, landscape, was, originally, undulating, ridge, and, swale, topography, in, one, of, the, earliest, large, scale, construction, projects, the, site, had, been, expertly, and, deliberately, leveled, and, filled, by, the, city, s, inhabitants, it, is, part, of, the, sophisticated, engineering, displayed, throughout, the, site, it, was, used, for, large, ceremonies, and, gatherings, as, well, as, for, ritual, games, such, as, chunkey, the, game, was, played, by, rolling, a, disc, shaped, chunky, stone, across, the, field, the, players, would, throw, spears, where, they, thought, the, chunky, stone, would, land, the, game, required, a, great, deal, of, judgment, and, aim, the, major, ceremonial, north, south, axis, connects, the, main, precinct, with, the, large, ridgetop, mortuary, mound, to, its, south, now, known, as, the, rattlesnake, mound, mound, 66, the, feature, named, the, rattlesnake, causeway, by, archaeologists, was, an, elevated, embankment, about, 18, metres, 59, ft, wide, roughly, 800, metres, 2, 600, ft, in, length, and, varies, in, height, from, 0, 5, metres, 1, 6, ft, to, almost, 1, 3, metres, 4, 3, ft, as, it, traverses, a, low, swampy, area, to, the, south, of, the, grand, plaza, it, is, aligned, 5, east, of, north, a, direction, thought, to, mimic, the, maximum, southern, moon, rise, of, 5, west, of, north, albeit, in, reverse, this, is, thought, to, have, had, symbolic, associations, to, the, builders, in, connection, with, their, lunar, maize, goddess, of, the, underworld, this, is, further, strengthened, by, its, close, proximity, to, the, ridgetop, mortuary, mound, 72, the, underworld, connotations, of, the, low, water, filled, area, the, causeway, traversed, and, its, terminus, at, the, mortuary, complex, at, the, rattlesnake, mound, the, causeway, itself, may, have, been, seen, as, a, symbolic, path, of, souls, the, high, status, central, district, of, cahokia, was, surrounded, by, a, 2, mi, long, palisade, that, was, equipped, with, protective, bastions, a, later, addition, to, the, site, when, the, palisade, was, constructed, it, cut, through, and, separated, some, pre, existing, neighborhoods, archaeologists, found, evidence, of, the, stockade, during, excavation, of, the, area, and, indications, that, it, was, rebuilt, several, times, its, bastions, showed, that, it, was, mainly, built, for, defensive, purposes, beyond, monks, mound, as, many, as, 120, more, mounds, stood, at, varying, distances, from, the, city, center, to, date, 109, mounds, have, been, located, 68, of, which, are, in, the, park, area, the, mounds, are, divided, into, three, different, types, platform, conical, and, ridge, top, each, appeared, to, have, had, its, own, meaning, and, function, in, general, terms, the, city, center, seems, to, have, been, laid, out, in, a, diamond, shaped, pattern, about, 1, mi, 1, 6, km, from, end, to, end, while, the, entire, city, is, 5, mi, 8, 0, km, across, from, east, to, west, cahokian, residential, zones, were, arranged, into, carefully, planned, clusters, around, plazas, and, mounds, specific, delineations, and, functions, have, been, hard, to, determine, but, many, of, these, clusters, may, have, been, designed, to, accommodate, religious, or, ethnic, segregations, cahokia, s, neighborhoods, possessed, a, standardized, suite, of, building, types, including, steam, baths, council, houses, and, temples, cahokian, domestic, structures, were, generally, of, pole, and, thatch, construction, and, followed, rectangular, footprints, wall, trenches, were, often, used, instead, of, posts, for, building, construction, alleen, betzenhauser, and, timothy, pauketat, argue, that, upwards, of, 20, percent, of, cahokia, s, neighborhood, structures, did, not, serve, domestic, functions, but, were, rather, intended, to, facilitate, engagement, with, non, human, spiritual, beings, as, part, of, an, animistic, religion, these, beings, may, have, resided, in, the, building, itself, or, inhabited, large, marker, posts, similar, to, the, posts, used, to, build, the, cahokia, woodhenge, betzenhauser, and, pauketat, compare, their, theorized, cahokian, buildings, to, similar, historical, examples, such, as, shaking, tents, or, medicine, lodges, monks, mound, is, the, largest, structure, and, central, focus, of, the, city, a, massive, platform, mound, with, four, terraces, 10, stories, tall, it, is, the, largest, man, made, earthen, mound, north, of, mexico, facing, south, it, is, 100, ft, 30, m, high, 951, ft, 290, m, long, 836, ft, 255, m, wide, and, covers, 13, 8, acres, 5, 6, ha, it, contains, about, 814, 000, cu, yd, 622, 000, m, 3, of, earth, the, mound, was, built, higher, and, wider, over, the, course, of, several, centuries, through, as, many, as, 10, separate, construction, episodes, as, the, mound, was, built, taller, and, the, terraces, and, apron, were, added, monks, mounds, was, named, for, the, community, of, trappist, monks, who, resided, there, for, a, short, time, after, euroamericans, settled, in, the, area, excavation, on, the, top, of, monks, mound, has, revealed, evidence, of, a, large, building, likely, a, temple, or, the, residence, of, the, paramount, chief, which, would, have, been, seen, throughout, the, city, this, building, was, about, 105, ft, 32, m, long, and, 48, feet, 15, m, wide, and, could, have, been, as, much, as, 50, ft, 15, m, high, it, was, about, 5, 000, sq, ft, 460, m, 2, the, east, and, northwest, sides, of, monks, mound, were, twice, excavated, in, august, 2007, during, an, attempt, to, avoid, erosion, due, to, slumping, these, areas, were, repaired, to, preserve, the, mound, during, excavation, of, mound, 72, a, ridge, top, burial, mound, south, of, main, urban, precinct, archaeologists, found, the, remains, of, about, 270, individuals, including, paired, male, female, burials, one, burial, feature, 101, was, buried, on, a, bed, of, 10, 000, marine, shell, disc, beads, arranged, in, the, shape, of, a, falcon, with, the, bird, s, head, appearing, beneath, and, beside, the, man, s, head, and, its, wings, and, tail, beneath, his, arms, and, legs, this, burial, is, known, as, the, beaded, burial, or, birdman, other, burials, such, as, the, exotic, cache, burial, in, the, mound, had, exotic, materials, and, huge, quantities, of, shell, beads, the, falcon, warrior, or, birdman, is, a, common, motif, in, mississippian, culture, this, burial, clearly, had, powerful, iconographic, significance, in, addition, a, cache, of, sophisticated, finely, worked, arrowheads, in, a, variety, of, different, styles, and, materials, was, found, near, the, grave, of, this, important, man, separated, into, four, types, each, from, a, different, geographical, region, the, arrowheads, demonstrated, cahokia, s, extensive, trade, links, in, north, america, archeologists, recovered, more, than, 250, other, skeletons, from, mound, 72, scholars, believe, almost, 62, of, these, were, sacrificial, victims, based, on, signs, of, ritual, execution, method, of, burial, and, other, factors, the, skeletons, include, the, relationship, of, these, burials, to, the, central, burial, is, unclear, they, were, unlikely, to, have, all, deposited, at, the, same, time, wood, in, several, parts, of, the, mound, has, been, radiocarbon, dated, to, between, 950, and, 1000, ce, excavations, have, indicated, that, mound, 72, was, not, constructed, as, a, single, mound, but, rather, as, a, series, of, smaller, mounds, these, mounds, were, reshaped, and, covered, over, to, give, mound, 72, its, final, ridge, top, shape, excavations, near, mound, 34, from, 2002, to, 2010, revealed, a, copper, workshop, this, unique, find, was, originally, discovered, in, the, 1950s, by, archaeologist, gregory, perino, but, its, exact, location, was, lost, for, 60, years, it, is, the, only, known, copper, workshop, to, be, found, at, a, mississippian, culture, site, the, area, contains, the, remains, of, three, tree, stumps, thought, to, have, been, used, to, hold, anvil, stones, analysis, of, copper, found, during, excavations, showed, that, it, had, been, annealed, a, technique, involving, repeatedly, heating, and, cooling, the, metal, as, it, is, worked, as, blacksmiths, do, with, iron, artisans, produced, religious, items, such, as, long, nosed, god, maskettes, ceremonial, earrings, with, a, symbolic, shape, thought, to, have, been, used, in, fictive, kinship, rituals, many, of, the, stylistically, related, mississippian, copper, plates, such, as, the, wulfing, cache, from, southeastern, missouri, some, of, the, etowah, plates, from, georgia, and, many, of, the, spiro, plates, from, oklahoma, are, associated, with, the, greater, braden, style, and, are, thought, to, have, been, made, in, cahokia, in, the, 13th, century, the, cahokia, woodhenge, was, a, series, of, large, timber, circles, located, roughly, 850, m, 2, 790, ft, to, the, west, of, monks, mound, they, are, thought, to, have, been, constructed, between, 900, and, 1100, ce, with, each, one, being, larger, and, having, 12, more, posts, than, its, predecessor, the, site, was, discovered, during, salvage, archaeology, undertaken, by, dr, warren, wittry, in, the, early, 1960s, interstate, highway, construction, boom, although, the, majority, of, the, site, contained, village, house, features, a, number, of, unusually, shaped, large, post, holes, were, also, discovered, when, the, holes, were, plotted, out, they, formed, several, arcs, of, equally, spaced, holes, detailed, analytical, work, supported, the, hypothesis, that, the, placement, of, these, posts, was, by, design, and, wittry, hypothesized, that, the, arcs, could, be, whole, circles, he, began, referring, to, the, circles, as, woodhenges, comparing, the, structures, to, england, s, well, known, circles, at, woodhenge, and, stonehenge, the, post, holes, found, by, wittry, are, an, example, of, how, soil, retains, the, memory, of, organic, materials, that, decayed, in, the, soil, from, thousands, of, years, ago, many, soils, have, a, naturally, acidic, component, that, breaks, down, most, organic, material, pretty, quickly, but, leaves, behind, dark, discoloration, in, the, soil, the, original, posts, of, cahokia, woodhenge, left, behind, this, same, discoloration, allowing, researchers, to, easily, identify, the, soil, as, having, once, contained, wooden, posts, additional, excavations, in, the, 1960s, 1980s, used, predictions, based, on, verified, posthole, locations, and, spacing, to, locate, other, postholes, and, confirm, the, existence, of, five, separate, timber, circles, in, the, general, vicinity, the, circles, are, now, designated, woodhenges, i, through, v, in, roman, numerals, in, 1985, a, reconstruction, of, woodhenge, iii, was, built, with, the, posts, being, placed, into, the, original, excavated, post, positions, the, circle, which, has, 48, posts, in, the, circle, and, a, 49th, central, post, has, been, used, to, investigate, archaeoastronomy, at, cahokia, the, illinois, historic, preservation, division, that, oversees, the, cahokia, site, hosts, public, sunrise, observations, at, the, vernal, and, autumnal, equinoxes, and, the, winter, and, summer, solstices, out, of, respect, for, native, american, beliefs, these, events, do, not, feature, ceremonies, or, rituals, of, any, kind, cahokia, is, recognized, as, one, of, the, centers, of, a, densely, populated, collections, of, sites, including, east, st, louis, st, louis, mounds, janey, b, goode, and, the, mitchell, site, this, region, of, sites, is, often, referred, to, as, greater, cahokia, because, they, were, all, inter, related, until, the, 19th, century, a, series, of, similar, mounds, was, documented, as, existing, in, what, is, now, the, city, of, st, louis, some, 8, mi, 13, km, to, the, west, of, cahokia, most, of, these, mounds, were, leveled, during, the, development, of, st, louis, and, much, of, their, material, was, reused, in, construction, projects, the, lone, survivor, of, these, mounds, is, sugarloaf, mound, located, on, the, west, bank, of, the, mississippi, it, marked, the, initial, border, between, st, louis, and, the, once, autonomous, city, of, carondelet, one, of, the, largest, mississippian, sites, is, kincaid, mounds, state, historic, site, located, in, massac, and, polk, counties, in, southern, illinois, it, is, 140, mi, 230, km, southeast, of, cahokia, located, in, the, floodplain, of, the, ohio, river, with, a, total, of, 19, mounds, at, the, complex, it, is, considered, the, fifth, largest, mississippian, site, in, terms, of, the, number, of, monuments, it, is, believed, to, have, been, a, chiefdom, as, an, elite, burial, mound, was, among, those, found, the, site, is, designated, as, a, national, historic, landmark, the, cahokia, museum, and, interpretive, center, which, receives, up, to, a, million, visitors, a, year, was, designed, by, aaic, inc, the, building, which, opened, in, 1989, received, the, thomas, h, madigan, award, the, st, louis, construction, news, reviews, readers, choice, award, the, merit, award, from, the, metal, construction, association, and, the, outstanding, achievement, award, from, the, brick, manufacturer, association, cahokia, has, long, been, a, point, of, interest, in, the, academic, community, as, early, as, the, 1960s, universities, across, the, midwest, have, gone, to, the, site, to, conduct, research, in, fields, ranging, from, geology, to, archaeology, one, of, the, most, prominent, archaeological, researchers, of, cahokia, is, timothy, pauketat, he, has, been, writing, about, and, researching, cahokia, for, the, majority, of, his, professional, career, other, prominent, cahokia, academics, include, warren, wittry, who, was, instrumental, in, the, recovery, of, cahokia, woodhenge, cahokia, mounds, was, first, protected, by, the, state, of, illinois, in, 1923, when, its, legislature, authorized, purchase, of, a, state, park, later, designation, as, a, state, historic, site, offered, additional, protection, but, the, site, came, under, significant, threat, from, the, federal, highway, building, program, in, the, 1950s, the, highway, program, reduced, the, site, s, integrity, however, it, increased, funding, for, emergency, archeological, investigations, these, investigations, became, intensive, and, today, continue, they, have, resulted, in, the, present, understanding, of, the, national, and, international, significance, of, the, site, the, site, was, designated, a, national, historic, landmark, on, july, 19, 1964, and, listed, on, the, national, register, of, historic, places, on, october, 15, 1966, in, 1982, unesco, the, united, nations, educational, scientific, and, cultural, organization, designated, the, site, a, world, heritage, site, this, is, the, only, such, self, contained, site, in, illinois, and, among, 24, world, heritage, sites, in, the, united, states, in, 2009, state, senator, evelyn, m, bowles, wrote, about, the, cahokia, mounds, site, through, the, years, my, friends, and, i, made, occasional, sunday, afternoon, trips, to, the, mounds, when, i, became, the, state, senator, it, afforded, me, the, opportunity, to, secure, funds, for, the, acquisition, of, additional, acreage, in, which, there, are, smaller, mounds, many, of, these, have, contained, additional, artifacts, the, designation, has, helped, protect, the, property, and, attract, funds, to, conduct, research, on, this,
