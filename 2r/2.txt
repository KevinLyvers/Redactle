historical, method, is, the, collection, of, techniques, and, guidelines, that, historians, use, to, research, and, write, histories, of, the, past, secondary, sources, primary, sources, and, material, evidence, such, as, that, derived, from, archaeology, may, all, be, drawn, on, and, the, historian, s, skill, lies, in, identifying, these, sources, evaluating, their, relative, authority, and, combining, their, testimony, appropriately, in, order, to, construct, an, accurate, and, reliable, picture, of, past, events, and, environments, in, the, philosophy, of, history, the, question, of, the, nature, and, the, possibility, of, a, sound, historical, method, is, raised, within, the, sub, field, of, epistemology, the, study, of, historical, method, and, of, different, ways, of, writing, history, is, known, as, historiography, though, historians, agree, in, very, general, and, basic, principles, in, practice, specific, canons, of, historical, proof, are, neither, widely, observed, nor, generally, agreed, upon, among, professional, historians, some, scholars, of, history, have, observed, that, there, are, no, particular, standards, for, historical, fields, such, as, religion, art, science, democracy, and, social, justice, as, these, are, by, their, nature, essentially, contested, fields, such, that, they, require, diverse, tools, particular, to, each, field, beforehand, in, order, to, interpret, topics, from, those, fields, source, criticism, or, information, evaluation, is, the, process, of, evaluating, the, qualities, of, an, information, source, such, as, its, validity, reliability, and, relevance, to, the, subject, under, investigation, gilbert, j, garraghan, and, jean, delanglez, 1946, divide, source, criticism, into, six, inquiries, the, first, four, are, known, as, higher, criticism, the, fifth, lower, criticism, and, together, external, criticism, the, sixth, and, final, inquiry, about, a, source, is, called, internal, criticism, together, this, inquiry, is, known, as, source, criticism, r, j, shafer, on, external, criticism, it, sometimes, is, said, that, its, function, is, negative, merely, saving, us, from, using, false, evidence, whereas, internal, criticism, has, the, positive, function, of, telling, us, how, to, use, authenticated, evidence, noting, that, few, documents, are, accepted, as, completely, reliable, louis, gottschalk, sets, down, the, general, rule, for, each, particular, of, a, document, the, process, of, establishing, credibility, should, be, separately, undertaken, regardless, of, the, general, credibility, of, the, author, an, author, s, trustworthiness, in, the, main, may, establish, a, background, probability, for, the, consideration, of, each, statement, but, each, piece, of, evidence, extracted, must, be, weighed, individually, bernheim, 1889, and, langlois, seignobos, 1898, proposed, a, seven, step, procedure, for, source, criticism, in, history, subsequent, descriptions, of, historical, method, outlined, below, have, attempted, to, overcome, the, credulity, built, into, the, first, step, formulated, by, the, nineteenth, century, historiographers, by, stating, principles, not, merely, by, which, different, reports, can, be, harmonized, but, instead, by, which, a, statement, found, in, a, source, may, be, considered, to, be, unreliable, or, reliable, as, it, stands, on, its, own, the, following, core, principles, of, source, criticism, were, formulated, by, two, scandinavian, historians, olden, j, rgensen, 1998, and, thur, n, torsten, 1997, historians, sometimes, have, to, deal, with, deciding, what, is, genuine, and, what, is, not, in, a, source, for, such, circumstances, there, are, external, and, internal, criteria, of, authenticity, that, are, applicable, these, are, technical, tools, for, evaluating, sources, and, separating, genuine, sources, or, content, from, forgeries, or, manipulation, external, criteria, involve, issues, relating, to, establishing, authorship, of, a, source, or, range, of, sources, it, involves, things, like, if, an, author, wrote, something, themselves, if, other, sources, attribute, authorship, to, the, source, agreement, of, independent, manuscript, copies, on, the, content, of, a, source, internal, criteria, involve, formalities, style, and, language, for, an, author, if, a, source, varies, from, the, environment, it, was, produced, inconsistencies, of, time, or, chronology, textual, transmission, of, a, source, interpolations, in, a, source, insertions, or, deletions, in, a, source, r, j, shafer, 1974, offers, this, checklist, for, evaluating, eyewitness, testimony, louis, gottschalk, adds, an, additional, consideration, even, when, the, fact, in, question, may, not, be, well, known, certain, kinds, of, statements, are, both, incidental, and, probable, to, such, a, degree, that, error, or, falsehood, seems, unlikely, if, an, ancient, inscription, on, a, road, tells, us, that, a, certain, proconsul, built, that, road, while, augustus, was, princeps, it, may, be, doubted, without, further, corroboration, that, that, proconsul, really, built, the, road, but, would, be, harder, to, doubt, that, the, road, was, built, during, the, principate, of, augustus, if, an, advertisement, informs, readers, that, a, and, b, coffee, may, be, bought, at, any, reliable, grocer, s, at, the, unusual, price, of, fifty, cents, a, pound, all, the, inferences, of, the, advertisement, may, well, be, doubted, without, corroboration, except, that, there, is, a, brand, of, coffee, on, the, market, called, a, and, b, coffee, garraghan, 1946, says, that, most, information, comes, from, indirect, witnesses, people, who, were, not, present, on, the, scene, but, heard, of, the, events, from, someone, else, gottschalk, says, that, a, historian, may, sometimes, use, hearsay, evidence, when, no, primary, texts, are, available, he, writes, in, cases, where, he, uses, secondary, witnesses, he, asks, 1, on, whose, primary, testimony, does, the, secondary, witness, base, his, statements, 2, did, the, secondary, witness, accurately, report, the, primary, testimony, as, a, whole, 3, if, not, in, what, details, did, he, accurately, report, the, primary, testimony, satisfactory, answers, to, the, second, and, third, questions, may, provide, the, historian, with, the, whole, or, the, gist, of, the, primary, testimony, upon, which, the, secondary, witness, may, be, his, only, means, of, knowledge, in, such, cases, the, secondary, source, is, the, historian, s, original, source, in, the, sense, of, being, the, origin, of, his, knowledge, insofar, as, this, original, source, is, an, accurate, report, of, primary, testimony, he, tests, its, credibility, as, he, would, that, of, the, primary, testimony, itself, gottschalk, adds, thus, hearsay, evidence, would, not, be, discarded, by, the, historian, as, it, would, be, by, a, law, court, merely, because, it, is, hearsay, gilbert, garraghan, 1946, maintains, that, oral, tradition, may, be, accepted, if, it, satisfies, either, two, broad, conditions, or, six, particular, conditions, as, follows, other, methods, of, verifying, oral, tradition, may, exist, such, as, comparison, with, the, evidence, of, archaeological, remains, more, recent, evidence, concerning, the, potential, reliability, or, unreliability, of, oral, tradition, has, come, out, of, fieldwork, in, west, africa, and, eastern, europe, historians, do, allow, for, the, use, of, anonymous, texts, to, establish, historical, facts, once, individual, pieces, of, information, have, been, assessed, in, context, hypotheses, can, be, formed, and, established, by, historical, reasoning, c, behan, mccullagh, 1984, lays, down, seven, conditions, for, a, successful, argument, to, the, best, explanation, mccullagh, sums, up, if, the, scope, and, strength, of, an, explanation, are, very, great, so, that, it, explains, a, large, number, and, variety, of, facts, many, more, than, any, competing, explanation, then, it, is, likely, to, be, true, mccullagh, 1984, states, this, form, of, argument, as, follows, mccullagh, gives, this, example, this, is, a, syllogism, in, probabilistic, form, making, use, of, a, generalization, formed, by, induction, from, numerous, examples, as, the, first, premise, the, structure, of, the, argument, is, as, follows, mccullagh, says, that, an, argument, from, analogy, if, sound, is, either, a, covert, statistical, syllogism, or, better, expressed, as, an, argument, to, the, best, explanation, it, is, a, statistical, syllogism, when, it, is, established, by, a, sufficient, number, and, variety, of, instances, of, the, generalization, otherwise, the, argument, may, be, invalid, because, properties, 1, through, n, are, unrelated, to, property, n, 1, unless, property, n, 1, is, the, best, explanation, of, properties, 1, through, n, analogy, therefore, is, uncontroversial, only, when, used, to, suggest, hypotheses, not, as, a, conclusive, argument
