occupied, europe, the, first, camps, were, established, in, march, 1933, immediately, after, adolf, hitler, became, chancellor, of, germany, following, the, 1934, purge, of, the, sa, the, concentration, camps, were, run, exclusively, by, the, ss, via, the, concentration, camps, inspectorate, and, later, the, ss, main, economic, and, administrative, office, initially, most, prisoners,

world, war, ii, people, from, german, occupied, europe, were, imprisoned, in, the, concentration, camps, about, 1, 65, million, people, were, registered, prisoners, in, the, camps, of, whom, about, a, million, died, during, their, imprisonment, most, of, the, fatalities, occurred, during, the, second, half, of, world, war, ii, including, at, least, a, third, of, the, 700, 000, prisoners, who, were, registered, as, of, january, 1945, following, allied, military, victories, the, camps, were, gradually, liberated, in, 1944, and, 1945, although, hundreds, of, thousands, of, prisoners, died, in, the, death, marches, museums, commemorating, the, victims, of, the, nazi, regime, have, been, established, at, many, of, the, former, camps, and, the, nazi, concentration, camp, system, has, become, a, universal, symbol, of, violence, and, terror, concentration, camps, are, conventionally, held, to, have, been, invented, by, the, british, during, the, second, boer, war, but, historian, dan, stone, argues, that, there, were, precedents, in, other, countries, and, that, camps, were, the, logical, extension, of, phenomena, that, had, long, characterized, colonial, rule, although, the, word, concentration, camp, has, acquired, the, connotation, of, murder, because, of, the, nazi, concentration, camps, the, british, camps, in, south, africa, did, not, involve, systematic, murder, the, german, empire, also, established, concentration, camps, during, the, herero, and, namaqua, genocide, 1904, 1907, the, death, rate, of, these, camps, was, 45, per, cent, twice, that, of, the, british, camps, during, the, first, world, war, eight, to, nine, million, prisoners, of, war, were, held, in, prisoner, of, war, camps, some, of, them, at, locations, which, were, later, the, sites, of, nazi, camps, such, as, theresienstadt, and, mauthausen, many, prisoners, held, by, germany, died, as, a, result, of, intentional, withholding, of, food, and, dangerous, working, conditions, in, violation, of, the, 1907, hague, convention, in, countries, such, as, france, belgium, italy, austria, hungary, and, germany, civilians, deemed, to, be, of, enemy, origin, were, denaturalized, hundreds, of,

prior, to, their, seizure, of, power, the, concentration, camp, system, arose, in, the, following, months, due, to, the, desire, to, suppress, tens, of, thousands, of, nazi, opponents, in, germany, the, reichstag, fire, in, february, 1933, was, the, pretext, for, mass, arrests, the, reichstag, fire, decree, eliminated, the, right, to, personal, freedom, enshrined, in, the, weimar, constitution, and, provided, a, legal, basis, for, detention, without, trial, the, first, camp, was, nohra, established, on, 3, march, 1933, in, a, school, the, number, of, prisoners, in, 1933, 1934, is, difficult, to, determine, historian, jane, caplan, estimated, it, at, 50, 000, with, arrests, perhaps, exceeding, 100, 000, eighty, per, cent, of, prisoners, were, members, of, the, communist, party, of, germany, and, ten, per, cent, members, of, the, social, democratic, party, of, germany, many, prisoners, were, released, in, late, 1933, and, after, a, christmas, amnesty, there, were, only, a, few, dozen, camps, left, about, 70, camps, were, established, in, 1933, in, any, convenient, structure, that, could, hold, prisoners, including, vacant, factories, prisons, country, estates, schools, workhouses, and, castles, there, was, no, national, system, camps, were, operated, by, local, police, ss, and, sa, state, interior, ministries, or, a, combination, of, the, above, the, early, camps, in, 1933, 1934, were, heterogeneous, and, fundamentally, differed, from, the, post, 1935, camps, in, organization, conditions, and, the, groups, imprisoned, on, 26, june, 1933, himmler, appointed, theodor, eicke, the, second, commandant, of, dachau, which, became, the, model, followed, by, other, camps, eicke, drafted, the, disciplinary, and, penal, code, a, manual, which, specified, draconian, punishments, for, disobedient, prisoners, he, also, created, a, system, of, prisoner, functionaries, which, later, developed, into, the, camp, elders, block, elders, and, kapo, of, later, camps, in, may, 1934, lichtenburg, was, taken, over, by, the, ss, from, the, prussian, bureaucracy, marking, the, beginning, of, a, transition, set, in, motion, by, heinrich, himmler, then, chief, of, the, gestapo, secret, police, following, the, purge, of, the, sa, on, 30, june, 1934, in, which, eicke, took, a, leading, role, the, remaining, sa, run, camps, were, taken, over, by, the, ss, in, december, 1934, eicke, was, appointed, the, first, inspector, of, the, concentration, camps, inspectorate, ikl, only, camps, managed, by, the, ikl, were, designated, concentration, camps, in, early, 1934, the, number, of, prisoners, was, still, falling, and, it, was, uncertain, if, the, system, would, continue, to, exist, by, mid, 1935, there, were, only, five, camps, holding, 4, 000, prisoners, and, 13, employees, at, the, central, ikl, office, at, the, same, time, 100, 000, people, were, imprisoned, in, german, jails, a, quarter, of, those, for, political, offenses, believing, nazi, germany, to, be,

by, 1938, in, the, place, of, the, camps, that, closed, down, eicke, opened, new, camps, at, sachsenhausen, september, 1936, and, buchenwald, july, 1937, unlike, earlier, camps, the, newly, opened, camps, were, purpose, built, isolated, from, the, population, and, the, rule, of, law, enabling, the, ss, to, exert, absolute, power, prisoners, who, previously, wore, civilian, clothes, were, forced, to, wear, uniforms, with, nazi, concentration, camp, badges, the, number, of, prisoners, began, to, rise, again, from, 4, 761, on, 1, november, 1936, to, 7, 750, by, the, end, of, 1937, by, the, end, of, june, 1938, the, prisoner, population, had, expanded, threefold, in, the, previous, six, months, to, 24, 000, prisoners, the, increase, was, fueled, by, arrests, of, those, considered, habitual, criminals, or, asocials, according, to, ss, chief, heinrich, himmler, the, criminal, prisoners, at, concentration, camps, needed, to, be, isolated, from, society, because, they, had, committed, offenses, of, a, sexual, or, violent, nature, in, fact, most, of, the, criminal, prisoners, were, working, class, men, who, had, resorted, to, petty, theft, to, support, their, families, nazi, raids, of, perceived, asocials, including, the, arrest, of, 10, 000, people, in, june, 1938, targeted, homeless, people, and, the, mentally, ill, as, well, as, the, unemployed, although, the, nazis, had, previously, targeted, social, outsiders, the, influx, of, new, prisoners, meant, that, political, prisoners, became, a, minority, to, house, the, new, prisoners, three, new, camps, were, established, flossenb, rg, may, 1938, near, the, czechoslovak, border, mauthausen, august, 1938, in, territory, annexed, from, austria, and, ravensbr, ck, may, 1939, the, first, purpose, built, camp, for, female, prisoners, the, mass, arrests, were, partly, motivated, by, economic, factors, recovery, from, the, great, depression, lowered, the, unemployment, rate, so, work, shy, elements, would, be, arrested, to, keep, others, working, harder, at, the, same, time, himmler, was, also, focusing, on, exploiting, prisoners, labor, within, the, camp, system, hitler, s, architect, albert, speer, had, grand, plans, for, creating, monumental, nazi, architecture, the, ss, company, german, earth, and, stone, works, dest, was, set, up, with, funds, from, speer, s, agency, for, exploiting, prisoner, labour, to, extract, building, materials, flossenb, rg, and, mauthausen, had, been, built, adjacent, to, quarries, and, dest, also, set, up, brickworks, at, buchenwald, and, sachsenhausen, political, prisoners, were, also, arrested, in, larger, numbers, including, jehovah, s, witnesses, and, german, migr, s, who, returned, home, czech, and, austrian, anti, nazis, were, arrested, after, the, annexation, of, their, countries, in, 1938, and, 1939, jews, were, also, increasingly, targeted, with, 2, 000, viennese, jews, arrested, after, the, nazi, annexation, after, the, kristallnacht, pogrom, in, november, 1938, 26, 000, jewish, men, were, deported, to, concentration, camps, following, mass, arrests, overwhelming, the, capacity, of, the, system, these, prisoners, were, subject, to, unprecedented, abuse, leading, to, hundreds, of, deaths, more, people, died, at, dachau, in, the, four, months, after, kristallnacht, than, in, the, previous, five, years, most, of, the, jewish, prisoners, were, soon, released, often, after, promising, to, emigrate, at, the, end, of, august, 1939, prisoners, of, flossenb, rg, sachsenhausen, and, other, concentration, camps, were, murdered, as, part, of, false, flag, attacks, staged, by, germany, to, justify, the, invasion, of, poland, during, the, war, the, camps, became, increasingly, brutal, and, lethal, due, to, the, plans, of, the, nazi, leadership, most, victims, died, in, the, second, half, of, the, war, five, new, camps, were, opened, between, the, start, of, the, war, and, the, end, of, 1941, neuengamme, early, 1940,

1941, in, territory, annexed, from, france, the, first, satellite, camps, were, also, established, administratively, subordinated, to, one, of, the, main, camps, the, number, of, prisoners, tripled, from, 21, 000, in, august, 1939, to, about, 70, 000, to, 80, 000, in, early, 1942, this, expansion, was, driven, by, the, demand, for, forced, labor, and, later, the, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, new, camps, were, sent, up, near, quarries, natzweiler, and, gross, rosen, or, brickworks, neuengamme, in, april, 1941, the, high, command, of, the, ss, ordered, the, murder, of, ill, and, exhausted, prisoners, who, could, no, longer, work, especially, those, deemed, racially, inferior, victims, were, selected, by, camp, personnel, or, traveling, doctors, and, were, removed, from, the, camps, to, be, murdered, in, euthanasia, centers, by, april, 1942, when, the, operation, finished, at, least, 6, 000, and, as, many, as, 20, 000, people, had, been, killed, the, first, act, of, systematic, killing, in, the, camp, system, beginning, in, august, 1941, selected, soviet, prisoners, of, war, were, killed, within, the, concentration, camps, usually, within, a, few, days, of, their, arrival, by, mid, 1942, when, the, operation, finished, at, least, 34, 000, soviet, prisoners, had, been, murdered, at, auschwitz, the, ss, used, zyklon, b, to, kill, soviet, prisoners, in, improvised, gas, chambers, in, 1942, the, emphasis, of, the, camps, shifted, to, the, war, effort, by, 1943, two, thirds, of, prisoners, were, employed, by, war, industries, the, death, rate, skyrocketed, with, an, estimated, half, of, the, 180, 000, prisoners, admitted, between, july, and, november, 1942, dying, by, the, end, of, that, interval, orders, to, reduce, deaths, in, order, to, spare, inmate, productivity, had, little, effect, in, practice, during, the, second, half, of, the, war, auschwitz, swelled, in, size, fueled, by, the, deportation, of, hundreds, of, thousands, of, jews, and, became, the, center, of, the, camp, system, it, was, the, deadliest, concentration, camp, and, jews, sent, there, faced, a, virtual, death, sentence, even, if, they, were, not, immediately, killed, as, most, were, in, august, 1943, 74, 000, of, the, 224, 000, registered, prisoners, in, all, ss, concentration, camps, were, in, auschwitz, in, 1943, and, early, 1944, additional, concentration, camps, riga, in, latvia, kovno, in, lithuania, vaivara, in, estonia, and, krak, w, plasz, w, in, poland, were, converted, from, ghettos, or, labor, camps, these, camps, were, populated, almost, entirely, by, jewish, prisoners, along, with, the, new, main, camps, many, satellite, camps, were, set, up, to, more, effectively, leverage, prisoner, labor, for, the, war, effort, beginning, in, the, mid, 1930s, the, camps, were, organized, according, to, the, following, structure, commandant, adjutant, political, department, protective, custody, camp, administration, camp, doctor, and, guard,

releasing, concentration, camp, prisoners, in, 1942, the, ikl, was, subordinated, to, the, ss, main, economic, and, administrative, office, ss, wvha, to, improve, the, camps, integration, into, the, war, economy, despite, changes, in, the, structure, the, ikl, remained, directly, responsible, to, himmler, the, camps, under, the, ikl, were, guarded, by, members, of, the, ss, totenkopfverbande, death, s, head, the, guards, were, housed, in, barracks, adjacent, to, the, camp, and, their, duties, were, to, guard, the, perimeter, of, the, camp, as, well, as, work, details, they, were, officially, forbidden, from, entering, the, camps, although, this, rule, was, not, followed, towards, the, end, of, the, 1930s, the, ss, totenkopfverbande, expanded, its, operations, and, set, up, military, units, which, followed, the, einsatzgruppen, death, squads, and, massacred, polish, jews, as, well, as, soviet, prisoners, of, war, older, general, ss, personnel, and, those, wounded, or, disabled, replaced, those, assigned, to, combat, duties, as, the, war, progressed, a, more, diverse, group, was, recruited, to, guard, the, expanding, camp, system, including, female, guards, who, were, not, part, of, the, ss, during, the, second, half, of, the, war, army, and, air, force, personnel, were, recruited, making, up, as, many, as, 52, per, cent, of, guards, by, january, 1945, the, manpower, shortage, was, reduced, by, relying, on, guard, dogs, and, delegating, some, duties, to, prisoners, corruption, was, widespread, most, of, the, camp, ss, leadership, was, middle, class, and, came, from, the, war, youth, generation, who, were, hard, hit, by, the, economic, crisis, and, feared, decline, in, status, most, had, joined, the, nazi, movement, by, september, 1931, and, were, offered, full, time, employment, in, 1933, ss, leaders, typically, lived, with, their, wives, and, children, near, the, camps, where, they, worked, often, engaging, prisoners, for, domestic, labor, perpetration, by, this, leadership, was, based, on, their, tight, social, bonds, a, perceived, common, sense, that, the, aims, of, the, system, were, good, as, well, as, the, opportunity, for, material, gain, before, world, war, ii, most, prisoners, in, the, concentration, camps, were, germans, after, the, expansion, of, nazi, germany, people, from, countries, occupied, by, the, wehrmacht, were, targeted, and, detained, in, concentration, camps, in, western, europe, arrests, focused, on, resistance, fighters, and, saboteurs, but, in, eastern, europe, arrests, included, mass, roundups, aimed, at, the, implementation, of, nazi, population, policy, and, the, forced, recruitment, of, workers, this, led, to, a, predominance, of, eastern, europeans, especially, poles, who, made, up, the, majority, of, the, population, of, some, camps, by, the, end, of, the, war, only, 5, to, 10, per, cent, of, the, camp, population, was, reich, germans, from, germany, or, austria, more, than, 100, 000, soviet, prisoners, of, war, and, smaller, groups, from, other, nationalities, were, transferred, to, the, concentration, camps, in, direct, violation, of, the, geneva, convention, most, jews, who, were, persecuted, and, killed, during, the, holocaust, were, never, prisoners, in, concentration, camps, significant, numbers, of, jews, were, imprisoned, beginning, in, november, 1938, because, of, kristallnacht, after, which, they, were, always, overrepresented, as, prisoners, during, the, height, of, the, holocaust, from, 1941, to, 1943, the, jewish, population, of, the, concentration, camps, was, low, extermination, camps, for, the, mass, murder, of, jews, kulmhof, belzec, sobibor, and, treblinka, were, set, up, outside, the, concentration, camp, system, the, existing, ikl, camps, auschwitz, and, majdanek, gained, additional, function, as, extermination, camps, after, mid, 1943, some, forced, labor, camps, for, jews, and, some, nazi, ghettos, were, converted, into, concentration, camps, other, jews, entered, the, concentration, camp, system, after, being, deported, to, auschwitz, despite, many, deaths, as, many, as, 200, 000, jews, survived, the, war, inside, the, camp, system, conditions, worsened, after, the, outbreak, of, war, due, to, reduction, in, food, worsening, housing, and, increase, in, work, deaths, from, disease, and, malnutrition, increased, outpacing, other, causes, of, death, however, the, food, provided, was, usually, sufficient, to, sustain, life, life, in, the, camps, has, often, been, depicted, as, a, darwinian, struggle, for, survival, although, some, mutual, aid, existed, individual, efforts, to, survive, sometimes, at, others, expense, could, hamper, the, aggregate, survival, rate, the, influx, of, non, german, prisoners, from, 1939, changed, the, previous, hierarchy, based, on, triangle, to, one, based, on, nationality, jews, slavic, prisoners, and, spanish, republicans, were, targeted, for, especially, harsh, treatment, which, led, to, a, high, mortality, rate, during, the, first, half, of, the, war, in, contrast, reich, germans, enjoyed, favorable, treatment, compared, to, other, nationalities, a, minority, of, prisoners, obtained, substantially, better, treatment, than, the, rest, because, they, were, prisoner, functionaries, mostly, germans, or, skilled, laborers, prisoner, functionaries, served, at, the, whim, of, the, ss, and, could, be, dismissed, for, insufficient, strictness, as, a, result, sociologist, wolfgang, sofsky, emphasizes, that, they, took, over, the, role, of, the, ss, in, order, to, prevent, ss, encroachment, and, other, prisoners, remembered, them, for, their, brutality, hard, labor, was, a, fundamental, component, of, the, concentration, camp, system, and, an, aspect, in, the, daily, life, of, prisoners, however, the, forced, labor, deployment, was, largely, determined, by, external, political, and, economic, factors, that, drove, demand, for, labor, during, the, first, years, of, the, camps, unemployment, was, high, and, prisoners, were, forced, to, perform, economically, valueless, but, strenuous, tasks, such, as, farming, on, moorland, such, as, at, esterwegen, other, prisoners, had, to, work, on, constructing, and, expanding, the, camps, in, the, years, before, world, war, ii, quarrying, and, bricklaying, for, the, ss, company, dest, played, a, central, role, in, prisoner, labor, despite, prisoners, increasing, economic, importance, conditions, declined, prisoners, were, seen, as, expendable, so, each, influx, of, prisoners, was, followed, by, increasing, death, rate, private, sector, cooperation, remained, marginal, to, the, overall, concentration, camp, system, for, the, first, half, of, the, war, after, the, failure, to, take, moscow, in, late, 1941, the, demand, for, armaments, increased, the, wvha, sought, out, partnerships, with, private, industry, and, speer, s, armaments, ministry, in, september, 1942, himmler, and, speer, agreed, to, use, prisoners, in, armaments, production, and, to, repair, damage, from, allied, bombing, local, authorities, and, private, companies, could, hire, prisoners, at, a, fixed, daily, cost, this, decision, paved, the, way, for, the, establishment, of, many, subcamps, located, near, workplaces, more, workers, were, obtained, through, transfers, from, prisons, and, forced, labor, programs, causing, the, prisoner, population, to, double, twice, by, mid, 1944, subcamps, where, prisoners, did, construction, work, had, significantly, higher, death, rates, than, those, that, worked, in, munitions, manufacture, by, the, end, of, the, war, main, camps, were, functioning, more, and, more, as, transfer, stations, from, which, prisoners, were, redirected, to, subcamps, at, their, peak, in, 1945, concentration, camp, prisoners, made, up, 3, per, cent, of, workers, in, germany, historian, marc, buggeln, estimates, that, no, more, than, 1, per, cent, of, the, labor, for, germany, s, arms, production, came, from, concentration, camp, prisoners, arrests, of, germans, in, 1933, were, often, accompanied, by, public, humiliation, or, beatings, if, released, prisoners, might, return, home, with, visible, marks, of, abuse, or, psychological, breakdown, using, a, dual, strategy, of, publicity, and, secrecy, the, regime, directed, terror, both, at, the, direct, victim, as, well, as, the, entire, society, in, order, to, eliminate, its, opponents, and, deter, resistance, beginning, in, march, 1933, detailed, reports, on, camp, conditions, were, published, in, the, press, nazi, propaganda, demonized, the, prisoners, as, race, traitors, sexual, degenerates, and, criminals, and, presented, the, camps, as, sites, of, re, education, after, 1933, reports, in, the, press, were, scarce, but, larger, numbers, of, people, were, arrested, and, people, who, interacted, with, the, camps, such, as, those, who, registered, deaths, could, make, conclusions, about, the, camp, conditions, and, discuss, with, acquaintances, the, visibility, of, the, camps, heightened, during, the, war, due, to, increasing, prisoner, numbers, the, establishment, of, many, subcamps, in, proximity, to, german, civilians, and, the, use, of, labor, deployments, outside, the, camps, these, subcamps, often, established, in, town, centers, in, such, locations, as, schools, restaurants, barracks, factory, buildings, or, military, camps, were, joint, ventures, between, industry, and, the, ss, an, increasing, number, of, german, civilians, interacted, with, the, camps, entrepreneurs, and, landowners, provided, land, or, services, doctors, decided, which, prisoners, were, healthy, enough, to, continue, working, foremen, oversaw, labor, deployments, and, administrators, helped, with, logistics, ss, construction, brigades, were, in, demand, by, municipalities, to, clear, bomb, debris, and, rebuild, for, the, prisoners, chances, of, survival, rarely, improved, despite, the, contact, with, the, outside, world, although, those, few, germans, who, tried, to, help, did, not, encounter, punishment, germans, were, often, shocked, to, see, the, reality, of, the, concentration, camps, up, close, but, reluctant, to, aid, the, prisoners, because, of, fear, that, they, would, be, imprisoned, as, well, others, found, the, poor, state, of, the, prisoners, to, confirm, nazi, propaganda, about, them, historian, robert, gellately, argues, that, the, germans, generally, turned, out, to, be, proud, and, pleased, that, hitler, and, his, henchmen, were, putting, away, certain, kinds, of, people, who, did, not, fit, in, or, who, were, regarded, as, outsiders, asocials, useless, eaters, or, criminals, according, to, historian, karola, fings, fear, of, arrest, did, not, undermine, public, support, for, the, camps, because, germans, saw, the, prisoners, rather, than, the, guards, as, criminals, she, writes, that, demand, for, ss, construction, brigades, points, to,
