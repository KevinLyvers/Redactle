although, definitions, of, music, vary, wildly, throughout, the, world, every, known, culture, partakes, in, it, and, it, is, thus, considered, a, cultural, universal, the, origins, of, music, remain, highly, contentious, commentators, often, relate, it, to, the, origin, of, language, with, much, disagreement, surrounding, whether, music, arose, before, after, or, simultaneously, with, language, many, theories, have, been, proposed, by, scholars, from, a, wide, range, of, disciplines, though, none, has, achieved, broad, approval, most, cultures, have, their, own, mythical, origins, concerning, the, invention, of, music, generally, rooted, in, their, respective, mythological, religious, or, philosophical, beliefs, the, music, of, prehistoric, cultures, is, first, firmly, dated, to, c, 40, 000, bp, of, the, upper, paleolithic, by, evidence, of, bone, flutes, though, it, remains, unclear, whether, or, not, the, actual, origins, lie, in, the, earlier, middle, paleolithic, period, 300, 000, to, 50, 000, bp, there, is, little, known, about, prehistoric, music, with, traces, mainly, limited, to, some, simple, flutes, and, percussion, instruments, however, such, evidence, indicates, that, music, existed, to, some, extent, in, prehistoric, societies, such, as, the, xia, dynasty, and, the, indus, valley, civilisation, upon, the, development, of, writing, the, music, of, literate, civilizations, ancient, music, was, present, in, the, major, chinese, egyptian, greek, indian, persian, mesopotamian, and, middle, eastern, societies, it, is, difficult, to, make, many, generalizations, about, ancient, music, as, a, whole, but, from, what, is, known, it, was, often, characterized, by, monophony, and, improvisation, in, ancient, song, forms, the, texts, were, closely, aligned, with, music, and, though, the, oldest, extant, musical, notation, survives, from, this, period, many, texts, survive, without, their, accompanying, music, such, as, the, rigveda, and, the, shijing, classic, of, poetry, the, eventual, emergence, of, the, silk, road, and, increasing, contact, between, cultures, led, to, the, transmission, and, exchange, of, musical, ideas, practices, and, instruments, such, interaction, led, to, the, tang, dynasty, s, music, being, heavily, influenced, by, central, asian, traditions, while, the, tang, dynasty, s, music, the, japanese, gagaku, and, korean, court, music, each, influenced, each, other, historically, religions, have, often, been, catalysts, for, music, the, vedas, of, hinduism, immensely, influenced, indian, classical, music, and, the, five, classics, of, confucianism, laid, the, basis, for, subsequent, chinese, music, following, the, rapid, spread, of, islam, in, the, 6th, century, islamic, music, dominated, persia, and, the, arab, world, and, the, islamic, golden, age, saw, the, presence, of, numerous, important, music, theorists, music, written, for, and, by, the, early, christian, church, properly, inaugurates, the, western, classical, music, tradition, which, continues, into, medieval, music, where, polyphony, staff, notation, and, nascent, forms, of, many, modern, instruments, developed, in, addition, to, religion, or, the, lack, thereof, a, society, s, music, is, influenced, by, all, other, aspects, of, its, culture, including, social, and, economic, organization, and, experience, climate, and, access, to, technology, many, cultures, have, coupled, music, with, other, art, forms, such, as, the, chinese, four, arts, and, the, medieval, quadrivium, the, emotions, and, ideas, that, music, expresses, the, situations, in, which, music, is, played, and, listened, to, and, the, attitudes, toward, musicians, and, composers, all, vary, between, regions, and, periods, many, cultures, have, or, continue, to, distinguish, between, art, music, or, classical, music, folk, music, and, popular, music, but, that, music, is, a, language, by, whose, means, messages, are, elaborated, that, such, messages, can, be, understood, by, the, many, but, sent, out, only, by, the, few, and, that, it, alone, among, all, language, unites, the, contradictory, character, of, being, at, once, intelligible, and, untranslatable, these, facts, make, the, creator, of, music, a, being, like, the, gods, and, make, music, itself, the, supreme, mystery, of, human, knowledge, claude, l, vi, strauss, the, raw, and, the, cooked, music, is, regarded, as, a, cultural, universal, though, definitions, of, it, vary, depending, on, culture, and, throughout, history, as, with, many, aspects, of, human, cognition, it, remains, debated, as, to, what, extent, the, origins, of, music, will, ever, be, understood, with, scholars, often, taking, polarizing, positions, the, origin, of, music, is, often, discussed, alongside, the, origin, of, language, with, the, nature, of, their, connection, being, the, subject, of, much, debate, however, before, the, mid, late, 20th, century, both, topics, were, seldom, given, substantial, attention, by, academics, since, the, topic, s, resurgence, the, principal, source, of, contention, is, divided, into, three, perspectives, whether, music, began, as, a, kind, of, proto, language, a, result, of, adaptation, that, led, to, language, if, music, is, a, spandrel, a, phenotypic, by, product, of, evolution, that, was, the, result, of, language, or, if, music, and, language, both, derived, from, a, common, antecedent, there, is, little, consensus, on, any, particular, theory, for, the, origin, of, music, which, have, included, contributions, from, archaeologists, cognitive, scientists, ethnomusicologists, evolutionary, biologists, linguists, neuroscientists, paleoanthropologists, philosophers, and, psychologists, developmental, and, social, some, of, the, most, prominent, theories, are, as, follows, many, cultures, have, their, own, mythical, origins, on, the, creation, of, music, specific, figures, are, sometimes, credited, with, inventing, music, such, as, jubal, in, christian, mythology, the, legendary, shah, jamshid, in, persian, iranian, mythology, the, goddess, saraswati, in, hinduism, and, the, muses, in, ancient, greek, mythology, some, cultures, credit, multiple, originators, of, music, ancient, egyptian, mythology, associates, it, with, numerous, deities, including, amun, hathor, isis, and, osiris, but, especially, ihy, there, are, many, stories, relating, to, music, s, origins, in, chinese, mythology, but, the, most, prominent, is, that, of, the, musician, ling, lun, who, on, the, orders, of, the, yellow, emperor, huangdi, invented, bamboo, flute, by, imitating, the, song, of, the, mythical, fenghuang, birds, in, the, broadest, sense, prehistoric, music, more, commonly, termed, primitive, music, in, the, past, encompasses, all, music, produced, in, preliterate, cultures, prehistory, beginning, at, least, 6, million, years, ago, when, humans, and, chimpanzees, last, had, a, common, ancestor, music, first, arose, in, the, paleolithic, period, though, it, remains, unclear, as, to, whether, this, was, the, middle, 300, 000, to, 50, 000, bp, or, upper, paleolithic, 50, 000, to, 12, 000, bp, the, vast, majority, of, paleolithic, instruments, have, been, found, in, europe, and, date, to, the, upper, paleolithic, it, is, certainly, possible, that, singing, emerged, far, before, this, time, though, this, is, essentially, impossible, to, confirm, the, potentially, oldest, instrument, is, the, divje, babe, flute, from, the, divje, babe, cave, in, slovenia, dated, to, 43, 000, and, 82, 000, and, made, from, a, young, cave, bear, femur, purportedly, used, by, neanderthals, the, divje, babe, flute, has, received, extensive, scholarly, attention, and, whether, it, is, truly, a, musical, instrument, or, an, object, formed, by, animals, is, the, subject, of, intense, debate, if, the, former, it, would, be, the, oldest, known, musical, instrument, and, evidence, of, a, musical, culture, in, the, middle, paleolithic, other, than, the, divje, babe, flute, and, three, other, doubtful, flutes, there, is, virtually, no, surviving, middle, paleolithic, musical, evidence, of, any, certainty, similar, to, the, situation, in, regards, to, visual, art, the, earliest, objects, whose, designations, as, musical, instruments, are, widely, accepted, are, bone, flutes, from, the, swabian, jura, germany, namely, from, the, geissenkl, sterle, hohle, fels, and, vogelherd, caves, dated, to, the, aurignacian, of, the, upper, paleolithic, and, used, by, early, european, modern, humans, from, all, three, caves, there, are, eight, examples, four, made, from, the, wing, bones, of, birds, and, four, from, mammoth, ivory, three, of, these, are, near, complete, three, flutes, from, the, geissenkl, sterle, are, dated, as, the, oldest, c, 43, 150, 39, 370, bp, considering, the, relative, complexity, of, flutes, it, is, likely, earlier, instruments, existed, akin, to, objects, that, are, common, in, later, hunter, and, gatherer, societies, such, as, rattles, shakers, and, drums, the, absence, of, other, instruments, from, and, before, this, time, may, be, due, to, their, use, of, weaker, and, thus, more, biodegradable, materials, such, as, reeds, gourds, skins, and, bark, a, painting, in, the, cave, of, the, trois, fr, res, dating, to, c, 15, 000, bce, is, thought, to, depict, a, shaman, playing, a, musical, bow, prehistoric, cultures, are, thought, to, have, had, a, wide, variety, of, uses, for, music, with, little, unification, between, different, societies, music, was, likely, of, particular, value, when, food, and, other, basic, needs, were, scarce, it, is, also, probable, that, prehistoric, cultures, viewed, music, as, intrinsically, connected, with, nature, and, may, have, believed, its, use, influenced, the, natural, world, directly, the, earliest, instruments, found, in, prehistoric, china, are, 12, gudi, bone, flutes, in, the, modern, day, jiahu, wuyang, henan, province, from, c, 6000, bce, the, only, instruments, dated, to, the, prehistoric, xia, dynasty, c, 2070, 1600, are, two, qing, two, small, bells, one, earthenware, one, bronze, and, a, xun, due, to, this, extreme, scarcity, of, surviving, instruments, and, the, general, uncertainty, surrounding, most, of, the, xia, creating, a, musical, narrative, of, the, period, is, impractical, in, the, indian, subcontinent, the, prehistoric, indus, valley, civilisation, from, c, 2500, 2000, bce, in, its, mature, state, has, archeological, evidence, that, indicates, simple, rattles, and, vessel, flutes, were, used, while, iconographical, evidence, suggests, early, harps, and, drums, also, existed, an, ideogram, in, the, later, ivc, contains, the, earliest, known, depiction, of, an, arched, harp, dated, sometime, before, 1800, bce, following, the, advent, of, writing, literate, civilizations, are, termed, part, of, the, ancient, world, the, first, of, which, is, sumerian, literature, of, abu, salabikh, now, southern, iraq, of, c, 2600, bce, though, the, music, of, ancient, societies, was, extremely, diverse, some, fundamental, concepts, arise, prominently, in, virtually, all, of, them, namely, monophony, improvisation, and, the, dominance, of, text, in, musical, settings, varying, song, forms, were, present, in, ancient, cultures, including, china, egypt, greece, india, mesopotamia, rome, and, the, middle, east, the, text, rhythm, and, melodies, of, these, songs, were, closely, aligned, as, was, music, in, general, with, magic, science, and, religion, complex, song, forms, developed, in, later, ancient, societies, particularly, the, national, festivals, of, china, greece, and, india, later, ancient, societies, also, saw, increased, trade, and, transmission, of, musical, ideas, and, instruments, often, shepherded, by, the, silk, road, for, example, a, tuning, key, for, a, qin, zither, from, 4th, 5th, centuries, bce, china, includes, considerable, persian, iconography, in, general, not, enough, information, exists, to, make, many, other, generalizations, about, ancient, music, between, cultures, the, few, actual, examples, of, ancient, music, notation, that, survive, usually, exist, on, papyrus, or, clay, tablets, information, on, musical, practices, genres, and, thought, is, mainly, available, through, literature, visual, depictions, and, increasingly, as, the, period, progresses, instruments, the, oldest, surviving, written, music, is, the, hurrian, songs, from, ugarit, syria, of, these, the, oldest, is, the, hymn, to, nikkal, hymn, no, 6, h, 6, which, is, somewhat, complete, and, dated, to, c, 1400, bce, however, the, seikilos, epitaph, is, the, earliest, entirely, complete, noted,

oracle, bones, but, also, as, bronze, inscriptions, as, many, as, 11, oracle, script, characters, may, refer, to, music, to, some, extent, some, of, which, could, be, iconographical, representations, of, instruments, themselves, the, stone, bells, qing, appears, to, have, been, particularly, popular, with, the, shang, ruling, class, and, while, no, surviving, flutes, have, been, dated, to, the,

dance, literature, and, fine, arts, many, early, chinese, thinkers, also, equated, music, with, proper, morality, and, governance, of, society, throughout, the, shang, and, zhou, music, was, a, symbol, of, power, for, the, imperial, court, being, used, in, religious, services, as, well, as, the, celebration, of, ancestors, and, heroes, confucius, c, 551, 479, formally, designated, the, music, concerned, with, ritual, and, ideal, morality, as, the, superior, yayue, proper, music, in, opposition, to, suyue, vernacular, popular, music, which, included, virtually, all, non, ceremonial, music, but, particularly, any, that, was, considered, excessive, or, lascivious, during, the, warring, states, period, when, of, confucius, s, lifetime, officials, often, ignored, this, distinction, preferring, more, lively, suyue, music, and, using, the, older, yayue, traditional, solely, for, political, means, confucius, and, disciples, such, as, mencius, considered, this, preference, virtueless, and, saw, ill, of, the, leaders, ignorance, of, ganying, a, theory, that, held, music, was, intrinsically, connected, to, the, universe, thus, many, aspects, of, ancient, chinese, music,

now, idealized, as, perfect, a, music, bureau, the, yuefu, was, founded, or, at, its, height, by, at, least, 120, bce, under, emperor, wu, of, han, and, was, responsible, for, collecting, folksongs, the, purpose, of, this, was, twofold, it, allowed, the, imperial, court, to, properly, understand, the, thoughts, of, the, common, people, and, it, was, also, an, opportunity, for, the, imperial,

earliest, and, chief, sources, for, ancient, indian, music, the, music, portions, alone, are, likely, from, the, gupta, period, 4th, century, to, 6th, century, ce, in, general, it, is, impossible, to, create, a, thorough, outline, of, the, earliest, music, in, persia, due, to, a, paucity, of, surviving, records, evidenced, by, c, 3300, 3100, bce, elam, depictions, arched, harps, are, the, first,

had, a, close, association, with, both, religion, and, animals, a, zoroastrian, myth, in, which, jamshid, attract, animals, with, the, trumpet, suggests, that, the, elamites, used, them, for, hunting, in, many, ways, the, earliest, known, musical, cultures, of, iran, are, strongly, connected, with, those, of, mesopotamia, ancient, arched, harps, c, 3000, also, exist, in, the, latter, and, the,

though, they, are, nearly, identical, to, their, contemporary, elamite, counterparts, from, the, evidence, in, terracotta, plaques, by, the, 2nd, century, bce, the, arched, harp, was, displaced, by, the, angular, harps, which, existed, in, 20, string, vertical, and, nine, string, horizontal, variants, lutes, were, purportedly, used, in, mesopotamia, by, at, least, 2300, bce, but, not, until, c, 1300, bce, do, they, appear, in, iran, where, they, became, the, dominant, string, instruments, of, western, iran, though, the, available, evidence, suggests, its, popularity, was, outside, of, the,

variety, of, flutes, other, textual, and, iconographical, evidence, indicates, the, continued, prominence, of, g, s, n, minstrels, however, like, the, achaemenid, period, greek, writers, continue, to, be, a, major, source, for, information, on, parthian, music, strabo, recorded, that, the, g, s, n, learned, songs, telling, tales, of, gods, and, noblemen, while, plutarch, similarly, records, the, g,

the, sasanian, period, 226, 651, ce, however, has, left, ample, evidence, of, music, this, influx, of, sasanian, records, suggests, a, prominent, musical, culture, in, the, empire, especially, in, the, areas, dominated, by, zoroastrianism, many, sassanian, shahanshahs, were, ardent, supporters, of, music, including, the, founder, of, the, empire, ardashir, i, and, bahram, v, khosrow, ii, r, 590, 628, was, the, most, outstanding, patron, his, reign, being, regarded, as, a, golden, age, of, persian, music, musicians, in, khosrow, s, service, include, z, dvar, e, changi, or, z, d, bamshad, the, harpist, nagisa, nakisa, ramtin, sarkash, and, barbad, who, was, the, most, famous, these, musicians, were, usually, active, as, minstrels, which, were, performers, who, worked, as, both, court, poets, and, musicians, in, the, sassanian, empire, there, was, little, distinction, between, poetry, and, music, the, western, african, nok, culture, modern, day, nigeria, existed, from, c, 500, 200, bce, and, left, a, considerable, amount, of, sculptures, among, these, are, depictions, of, music, such, as, a, man, who, shakes, two, objects, thought, to, be, maracas, another, sculpture, includes, a, man, with, his, mouth, opening, possibly, singing, while, there, is, also, a, sculpture, of, a, man, playing, a, drum, the, imperial, court, of, japan, developed, gagaku, lit, elegant, music, music, originating, from, the, gagakury, imperial, music, academy, established, in, 701, ce, during, the, asuka, period, though, the, word, gagaku, derives, from, the, chinese, yayue, music, the, latter, originally, referred, to, confucian, ritual, music, while, gagaku, extends, to, many, genres, styles, and, instruments, in, the, tradition, s, early, history, the, three, main, genres, were, wagaku, native, japanese, music, sankangaku, music, from, the, three, kingdoms, of, korea, and, t, gaku, music, from, china, s, tang, dynasty, as, well, as, more, minor, genres, such, as, toragaku, gigaku, and, rin, y, gaku, uniquely, among, asian, music, of, this, time, there, are, numerous, extant, scores, of, gagaku, music, from, the, 8th, to, 11th, centuries, a, major, shift, in, gagaku, music, occurred, in, the, 9th, century, namely, the, development, of, a, distinction, between, t, gaku, and, komagaku, music, t, gaku, was, a, chinese, influenced, style, which, combined, with, the, rin, y, gaku, tradition, referred, to, as, music, of, the, left, sah, komagaku, was, then, referred, to, as, music, of, the, right, uh, encompassing, music, influenced, by, both, korea, sankangaku, and, balhae, bokkaigaku, though, this, division, was, prominent, it, was, not, strict, and, the, t, gaku, and, komagaku, styles, nonetheless, interlaced, and, influenced, each, other, the, long, heian, period, 794, 1185, saw, much, patronage, of, gagaku, music, from, the, court, as, it, accompanied, many, festivals, and, celebrations, numerous, new, genres, emerged, at, this, time, such, as, the, saibara, and, r, ei, song, forms, gagaku, ensembles, consist, of, a, wide, variety, of, instruments, and, are, the, largest, such, formations, in, traditional, japanese, music, modern, scholars, generally, define, medieval, music, as, the, music, of, western, europe, during, the, middle, ages, from, approximately, the, 6th, to, 15th, centuries, music, was, certainly, prominent, in, the, early, middle, ages, as, attested, by, artistic, depictions, of, instruments, writings, about, music, and, other, records, however, the, only, repertory, of, music, which, has, survived, from, before, 800, to, the, present, day, is, the, plainsong, liturgical, music, of, the, roman, catholic, church, the, largest, part, of, which, is, called, gregorian, chant, pope, gregory, i, who, gave, his, name, to, the, musical, repertory, and, may, himself, have, been, a, composer, is, usually, claimed, to, be, the, originator, of, the, musical, portion, of, the, liturgy, in, its, present, form, though, the, sources, giving, details, on, his, contribution, date, from, more, than, a, hundred, years, after, his, death, many, scholars, believe, that, his, reputation, has, been, exaggerated, by, legend, most, of, the, chant, repertory, was, composed, anonymously, in, the, centuries, between, the, time, of, gregory, and, charlemagne, during, the, 9th, century, several, important, developments, took, place, first, there, was, a, major, effort, by, the, church, to, unify, the, many, chant, traditions, and, suppress, many, of, them, in, favor, of, the, gregorian, liturgy, second, the, earliest, polyphonic, music, was, sung, a, form, of, parallel, singing, known, as, organum, third, and, of, the, greatest, significance, for, music, history, notation, was, reinvented, after, a, lapse, of, about, five, hundred, years, though, it, would, be, several, more, centuries, before, a, system, of, pitch, and, rhythm, notation, evolved, having, the, precision, and, flexibility, that, modern, musicians, take, for, granted, several, schools, of, polyphony, flourished, in, the, period, after, 1100, the, st, martial, school, of, organum, the, music, of, which, was, often, characterized, by, a, swiftly, moving, part, over, a, single, sustained, line, the, notre, dame, school, of, polyphony, which, included, the, composers, l, onin, and, p, rotin, and, which, produced, the, first, music, for, more, than, two, parts, around, 1200, the, musical, melting, pot, of, santiago, de, compostela, in, galicia, a, pilgrimage, destination, and, site, where, musicians, from, many, traditions, came, together, in, the, late, middle, ages, the, music, of, whom, survives, in, the, codex, calixtinus, and, the, english, school, the, music, of, which, survives, in, the, worcester, fragments, and, the, old, hall, manuscript, alongside, these, schools, of, sacred, music, a, vibrant, tradition, of, the, secular, song, developed, as, exemplified, in, the, music, of, the, troubadours, trouv, res, and, minnes, nger, much, of, the, later, secular, music, of, the, early, renaissance, evolved, from, the, forms, ideas, and, the, musical, aesthetic, of, the, troubadours, courtly, poets, and, itinerant, musicians, whose, culture, was, largely, exterminated, during, the, albigensian, crusade, in, the, early, 13th, century, forms, of, sacred, music, which, developed, during, the, late, 13th, century, included, the, motet, conductus, discant, and, clausulae, one, unusual, development, was, the, geisslerlieder, the, music, of, wandering, bands, of, flagellants, during, two, periods, the, middle, of, the, 13th, century, until, they, were, suppressed, by, the, church, and, the, period, during, and, immediately, following, the, black, death, around, 1350, when, their, activities, were, vividly, recorded, and, well, documented, with, notated, music, their, music, mixed, folk, song, styles, with, penitential, or, apocalyptic, texts, the, 14th, century, in, european, music, history, is, dominated, by, the, style, of, the, ars, nova, which, by, convention, is, grouped, with, the, medieval, era, in, music, even, though, it, had, much, in, common, with, early, renaissance, ideals, and, aesthetics, much, of, the, surviving, music, of, the, time, is, secular, and, tends, to, use, the, formes, fixes, the, ballade, the, virelai, the, lai, the, rondeau, which, correspond, to, poetic, forms, of, the, same, names, most, pieces, in, these, forms, are, for, one, to, three, voices, likely, with, instrumental, accompaniment, famous, composers, include, guillaume, de, machaut, and, francesco, landini, prominent, and, diverse, musical, practices, were, present, in, the, byzantine, empire, which, existed, by, 395, to, 1453, both, sacred, and, secular, music, were, commonplace, with, sacred, music, frequently, used, in, church, services, and, secular, music, in, many, events, including, ceremonies, dramas, ballets, banquets, festivals, and, sports, games, however, despite, its, popularity, secular, byzantine, music, was, harshly, criticized, by, the, church, fathers, particularly, jerome, composers, of, sacred, music, especially, hymns, and, chants, are, generally, well, documented, throughout, the, history, of, byzantine, music, however, those, before, the, reign, of, justinian, i, are, virtually, unknown, the, monks, anthimos, auxentios, and, timokles, are, said, to, have, written, troparia, but, only, the, text, to, a, single, one, by, auxentios, survives, the, first, major, form, was, the, kontakion, of, which, romanos, the, melodist, was, the, foremost, composer, in, the, late, 7th, century, the, kan, n, overtook, the, kontakion, in, popularity, andrew, of, crete, became, its, first, significant, composer, and, is, traditionally, credited, as, the, genre, s, originator, though, modern, scholars, now, doubt, this, attribution, the, ka, on, reached, its, peak, with, the, music, of, john, of, damascus, and, cosmas, of, maiuma, and, later, theodore, of, stoudios, and, theophanes, the, branded, in, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, respectively, composers, of, secular, music, are, considerably, less, documented, not, until, late, in, the, empire, s, history, are, composers, known, by, name, with, joannes, koukouzeles, xenos, korones, and, joannes, glykys, as, the, leading, figures, like, their, western, counterparts, of, the, same, period, byzantine, composers, were, primarily, men, kassia, is, a, major, exception, to, this, she, was, a, prolific, and, important, composer, of, sticheron, hymns, and, the, only, woman, whose, works, entered, the, byzantine, liturgy, a, few, other, women, are, known, to, have, been, composers, thekla, theodosia, martha, and, the, daughter, of, john, kladas, her, given, name, is, unrecorded, only, the, latter, has, any, surviving, work, a, single, antiphon, some, byzantine, emperors, are, known, to, have, been, composers, such, as, leo, vi, the, wise, and, constantine, vii, during, the, ancient, and, medieval, periods, the, classical, music, of, the, indian, subcontinent, was, a, largely, unified, practice, by, the, 14th, century, socio, political, turmoil, inaugurated, by, the, delhi, sultanate, began, to, isolate, northern, and, southern, india, and, independent, traditions, in, each, region, began, emerging, by, the, 16th, century, two, distinct, styles, had, formed, the, hindustani, classical, music, of, the, north, and, the, carnatic, classical, music, of, the, south, one, of, the, major, differences, between, them, is, that, the, northern, hindustani, vein, was, considerably, influenced, by, the, persian, and, arab, musical, practices, of, the, time, carnatic, music, is, largely, devotional, the, majority, of, the, songs, are, addressed, to, the, hindu, deities, indian, classical, music, marga, is, monophonic, and, based, on, a, single, melody, line, or, raga, rhythmically, organized, through, talas, the, beginning, of, the, renaissance, in, music, is, not, as, clearly, marked, as, the, beginning, of, the, renaissance, in, the, other, arts, and, unlike, in, the, other, arts, it, did, not, begin, in, italy, but, in, northern, europe, specifically, in, the, area, currently, comprising, central, and, northern, france, the, netherlands, and, belgium, the, style, of, the, burgundian, composers, as, the, first, generation, of, the, franco, flemish, school, is, known, was, at, first, a, reaction, against, the, excessive, complexity, and, mannered, style, of, the, late, 14th, century, ars, subtilior, and, contained, clear, singable, melody, and, balanced, polyphony, in, all, voices, the, most, famous, composers, of, the, burgundian, school, in, the, mid, 15th, century, are, guillaume, dufay, gilles, binchois, and, antoine, busnois, by, the, middle, of, the, 15th, century, composers, and, singers, from, the, low, countries, and, adjacent, areas, began, to, spread, across, europe, especially, into, italy, where, they, were, employed, by, the, papal, chapel, and, the, aristocratic, patrons, of, the, arts, such, as, the, medici, the, este, and, the, sforza, families, they, carried, their, style, with, them, smooth, polyphony, which, could, be, adapted, for, sacred, or, secular, use, as, appropriate, principal, forms, of, sacred, musical, composition, at, the, time, were, the, mass, the, motet, and, the, laude, secular, forms, included, the, chanson, the, frottola, and, later, the, madrigal, the, invention, of, printing, had, an, immense, influence, on, the, dissemination, of, musical, styles, and, along, with, the, movement, of, the, franco, flemish, musicians, contributed, to, the, establishment, of, the, first, truly, international, style, in, european, music, since, the, unification, of, gregorian, chant, under, charlemagne, composers, of, the, middle, generation, of, the, franco, flemish, school, included, johannes, ockeghem, who, wrote, music, in, a, contrapuntally, complex, style, with, varied, texture, and, an, elaborate, use, of, canonical, devices, jacob, obrecht, one, of, the, most, famous, composers, of, masses, in, the, last, decades, of, the, 15th, century, and, josquin, des, prez, probably, the, most, famous, composer, in, europe, before, palestrina, and, who, during, the, 16th, century, was, renowned, as, one, of, the, greatest, artists, in, any, form, music, in, the, generation, after, josquin, explored, increasing, complexity, of, counterpoint, possibly, the, most, extreme, expression, is, in, the, music, of, nicolas, gombert, whose, contrapuntal, complexities, influenced, early, instrumental, music, such, as, the, canzona, and, the, ricercar, ultimately, culminating, in, baroque, fugal, forms, by, the, middle, of, the, 16th, century, the, international, style, began, to, break, down, and, several, highly, diverse, stylistic, trends, became, evident, a, trend, towards, simplicity, in, sacred, music, as, directed, by, the, counter, reformation, council, of, trent, exemplified, in, the, music, of, giovanni, pierluigi, da, palestrina, a, trend, towards, complexity, and, chromaticism, in, the, madrigal, which, reached, its, extreme, expression, in, the, avant, garde, style, of, the, ferrara, school, of, luzzaschi, and, the, late, century, madrigalist, carlo, gesualdo, and, the, grandiose, sonorous, music, of, the, venetian, school, which, used, the, architecture, of, the, basilica, san, marco, di, venezia, to, create, antiphonal, contrasts, the, music, of, the, venetian, school, included, the, development, of, orchestration, ornamented, instrumental, parts, and, continuo, bass, parts, all, of, which, occurred, within, a, span, of, several, decades, around, 1600, famous, composers, in, venice, included, the, gabrielis, andrea, and, giovanni, as, well, as, claudio, monteverdi, one, of, the, most, significant, innovators, at, the, end, of, the, era, most, parts, of, europe, had, active, and, well, differentiated, musical, traditions, by, late, in, the, century, in, england, composers, such, as, thomas, tallis, and, william, byrd, wrote, sacred, music, in, a, style, similar, to, that, written, on, the, continent, while, an, active, group, of, home, grown, madrigalists, adapted, the, italian, form, for, english, tastes, famous, composers, included, thomas, morley, john, wilbye, and, thomas, weelkes, spain, developed, instrumental, and, vocal, styles, of, its, own, with, tom, s, luis, de, victoria, writing, refined, music, similar, to, that, of, palestrina, and, numerous, other, composers, writing, for, the, new, guitar, germany, cultivated, polyphonic, forms, built, on, the, protestant, chorales, which, replaced, the, roman, catholic, gregorian, chant, as, a, basis, for, sacred, music, and, imported, the, style, of, the, venetian, school, the, appearance, of, which, defined, the, start, of, the, baroque, era, there, in, addition, dutch, and, german, composers, particularly, jan, pieterszoon, sweelinck, wrote, enormous, amounts, of, organ, music, establishing, the, basis, for, the, later, baroque, organ, style, which, culminated, in, the, work, of, j, s, bach, france, developed, a, unique, style, of, musical, diction, known, as, musique, mesur, e, used, in, secular, chansons, with, composers, such, as, guillaume, costeley, and, claude, le, jeune, prominent, in, the, movement, one, of, the, most, revolutionary, movements, in, the, era, took, place, in, florence, in, the, 1570s, and, 1580s, with, the, work, of, the, florentine, camerata, who, ironically, had, a, reactionary, intent, dissatisfied, with, what, they, saw, as, contemporary, musical, depravities, their, goal, was, to, restore, the, music, of, the, ancient, greeks, chief, among, them, were, vincenzo, galilei, the, father, of, the, astronomer, and, giulio, caccini, the, fruits, of, their, labors, was, a, declamatory, melodic, singing, style, known, as, monody, and, a, corresponding, staged, dramatic, form, a, form, known, today, as, opera, the, first, operas, written, around, 1600, also, define, the, end, of, the, renaissance, and, the, beginning, of, the, baroque, eras, music, prior, to, 1600, was, modal, rather, than, tonal, several, theoretical, developments, late, in, the, 16th, century, such, as, the, writings, on, scales, on, modes, by, gioseffo, zarlino, and, franchinus, gaffurius, led, directly, to, the, development, of, common, practice, tonality, the, major, and, minor, scales, began, to, predominate, over, the, old, church, modes, a, feature, which, was, at, first, most, obvious, at, cadential, points, in, compositions, but, gradually, became, pervasive, music, after, 1600, beginning, with, the, tonal, music, of, the, baroque, era, is, often, referred, to, as, belonging, to, the, common, practice, period, the, baroque, era, took, place, from, 1600, to, 1750, as, the, baroque, artistic, style, flourished, across, europe, and, during, this, time, music, expanded, in, its, range, and, complexity, baroque, music, began, when, the, first, operas, dramatic, solo, vocal, music, accompanied, by, orchestra, were, written, during, the, baroque, era, polyphonic, contrapuntal, music, in, which, multiple, simultaneous, independent, melody, lines, were, used, remained, important, counterpoint, was, important, in, the, vocal, music, of, the, medieval, era, german, italian, french, dutch, polish, spanish, portuguese, and, english, baroque, composers, wrote, for, small, ensembles, including, strings, brass, and, woodwinds, as, well, as, for, choirs, and, keyboard, instruments, such, as, pipe, organ, harpsichord, and, clavichord, during, this, period, several, major, music, forms, were, defined, that, lasted, into, later, periods, when, they, were, expanded, and, evolved, further, including, the, fugue, the, invention, the, sonata, and, the, concerto, the, late, baroque, style, was, polyphonically, complex, and, richly, ornamented, important, composers, from, the, baroque, era, include, jan, pieterszoon, sweelinck, johann, sebastian, bach, arcangelo, corelli, fran, ois, couperin, girolamo, frescobaldi, george, frideric, handel, jean, baptiste, lully, jean, philippe, rameau, claudio, monteverdi, georg, philipp, telemann, and, antonio, vivaldi, the, music, of, the, classical, period, is, characterized, by, homophonic, texture, or, an, obvious, melody, with, accompaniment, these, new, melodies, tended, to, be, almost, voice, like, and, singable, allowing, composers, to, actually, replace, singers, as, the, focus, of, the, music, instrumental, music, therefore, quickly, replaced, opera, and, other, sung, forms, such, as, oratorio, as, the, favorite, of, the, musical, audience, and, the, epitome, of, great, composition, however, opera, did, not, disappear, during, the, classical, period, several, composers, began, producing, operas, for, the, general, public, in, their, native, languages, previous, operas, were, generally, in, italian, along, with, the, gradual, displacement, of, the, voice, in, favor, of, stronger, clearer, melodies, counterpoint, also, typically, became, a, decorative, flourish, often, used, near, the, end, of, a, work, or, for, a, single, movement, in, its, stead, simple, patterns, such, as, arpeggios, and, in, piano, music, alberti, bass, an, accompaniment, with, a, repeated, pattern, typically, in, the, left, hand, were, used, to, liven, the, movement, of, the, piece, without, creating, a, confusing, additional, voice, the, now, popular, instrumental, music, was, dominated, by, several, well, defined, forms, the, sonata, the, symphony, and, the, concerto, though, none, of, these, were, specifically, defined, or, taught, at, the, time, as, they, are, now, in, music, theory, all, three, derive, from, sonata, form, which, is, both, the, overlying, form, of, an, entire, work, and, the, structure, of, a, single, movement, sonata, form, matured, during, the, classical, era, to, become, the, primary, form, of, instrumental, compositions, throughout, the, 19th, century, the, early, classical, period, was, ushered, in, by, the, mannheim, school, which, included, such, composers, as, johann, stamitz, franz, xaver, richter, carl, stamitz, and, christian, cannabich, it, exerted, a, profound, influence, on, joseph, haydn, and, through, him, on, all, subsequent, european, music, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, was, the, central, figure, of, the, classical, period, and, his, phenomenal, and, varied, output, in, all, genres, defines, our, perception, of, the, period, ludwig, van, beethoven, and, franz, schubert, were, transitional, composers, leading, into, the, romantic, period, with, their, expansion, of, existing, genres, forms, and, even, functions, of, music, in, the, romantic, period, music, became, more, expressive, and, emotional, expanding, to, encompass, literature, art, and, philosophy, famous, early, romantic, composers, include, schumann, chopin, mendelssohn, bellini, donizetti, and, berlioz, the, late, 19th, century, saw, a, dramatic, expansion, in, the, size, of, the, orchestra, and, in, the, role, of, concerts, as, part, of, urban, society, famous, composers, from, the, second, half, of, the, century, include, johann, strauss, ii, brahms, liszt, tchaikovsky, verdi, and, wagner, between, 1890, and, 1910, a, third, wave, of, composers, including, grieg, dvo, k, mahler, richard, strauss, puccini, and, sibelius, built, on, the, work, of, middle, romantic, composers, to, create, even, more, complex, and, often, much, longer, musical, works, a, prominent, mark, of, late, 19th, century, music, is, its, nationalistic, fervor, as, exemplified, by, such, figures, as, dvo, k, sibelius, and, grieg, other, prominent, late, century, figures, include, saint, sa, ns, faur, rachmaninoff, franck, debussy, and, rimsky, korsakov, the, 20th, century, saw, a, revolution, in, music, listening, as, the, radio, gained, popularity, worldwide, and, new, media, and, technologies, were, developed, to, record, edit, and, distribute, music, music, performances, became, increasingly, visual, with, the, broadcast, and, recording, of, performances, 20th, century, music, brought, new, freedom, and, wide, experimentation, with, new, musical, styles, and, forms, that, challenged, the, accepted, rules, of, music, of, earlier, periods, the, invention, of, musical, amplification, and, electronic, instruments, especially, the, synthesizer, in, the, mid, 20th, century, revolutionized, classical, and, popular, music, and, accelerated, the, development, of, new, forms, of, music, as, for, classical, music, two, fundamental, schools, determined, the, course, of, the, century, that, of, arnold, schoenberg, and, that, of, igor, stravinsky, however, other, composers, also, had, a, notable, influence, for, example, b, la, bart, k, anton, webern, dmitri, shostakovich, olivier, messiaen, john, cage, benjamin, britten, karlheinz, stockhausen, sofia, gubaidulina, krzysztof, penderecki, brian, ferneyhough, kaija, saariaho, the, 20th, century, saw, the, unprecedented, dissemination, of,
