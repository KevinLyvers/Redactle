ostsiedlung, german, pronunciation, lit, east, settlement, is, the, term, for, the, early, medieval, and, high, medieval, migration, of, ethnic, germans, and, germanization, of, the, areas, populated, by, slavic, baltic, and, finnic, peoples, the, most, settled, area, was, known, as, germania, slavica, germanization, efforts, included, eastern, parts, of, francia, east, francia, and, the, holy, roman, empire, and, beyond, and, the, consequences, for, settlement, development, and, social, structures, in, the, areas, of, settlement, other, regions, were, also, settled, though, not, as, heavily, the, ostsiedlung, encompassed, multiple, modern, and, historical, regions, primarily, germany, east, of, the, saale, and, elbe, rivers, the, states, of, lower, austria, and, styria, in, austria, poland, and, the, czech, republic, but, also, in, other, parts, of, central, and, eastern, europe, the, majority, of, ostsiedlung, settlers, moved, individually, in, independent, efforts, in, multiple, stages, and, on, different, routes, many, settlers, were, encouraged, and, invited, by, the, local, princes, and, regional, lords, who, sometimes, even, expelled, part, of, the, indigenous, populations, to, make, room, for, german, settlers, smaller, groups, of, migrants, first, moved, to, the, east, during, the, early, middle, ages, larger, treks, of, settlers, which, included, scholars, monks, missionaries, craftsmen, and, artisans, often, invited, in, numbers, unverifiable, first, moved, eastwards, during, the, mid, 12th, century, the, military, territorial, conquests, and, punitive, expeditions, of, the, ottonian, and, salian, emperors, during, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, do, not, form, part, of, the, ostsiedlung, as, these, actions, didn, t, result, in, any, noteworthy, settlement, establishment, east, of, the, elbe, and, saale, rivers, the, ostsiedlung, is, considered, to, have, been, a, purely, medieval, event, as, it, ended, in, the, beginning, of, the, 14th, century, the, legal, cultural, linguistic, religious, and, economic, changes, caused, by, the, movement, had, a, profound, influence, on, the, history, of, eastern, central, europe, between, the, baltic, sea, and, the, carpathians, until, the, 20th, century, in, the, 20th, century, accounts, of, the, ostsiedlung, were, heavily, exploited, by, german, nationalists, including, the, nazi, movement, to, press, the, territorial, claims, of, germany, and, to, demonstrate, supposed, german, superiority, over, non, germanic, peoples, whose, cultural, urban, and, scientific, achievements, in, that, era, were, undermined, rejected, or, presented, as, german, after, world, war, i, 1914, 1918, the, fact, that, germany, and, austria, lost, part, of, their, territories, in, the, east, appeared, as, a, counterpoint, to, ostsiedlung, because, some, of, the, germans, in, the, east, became, foreign, citizens, when, their, homes, were, no, longer, part, of, germany, and, austria, the, germans, in, the, east, outside, germany, and, austria, were, not, expelled, and, the, regions, that, germany, and, austria, lost, in, the, east, were, dominated, by, non, german, peoples, so, the, german, loss, here, was, not, as, severe, as, after, world, war, ii, in, and, after, world, war, ii, 1944, 1950, germans, were, driven, out, and, deported, to, rump, germany, from, the, east, and, their, language, and, culture, were, lost, in, most, areas, including, the, german, dominated, lands, which, germany, lost, after, this, war, in, which, german, people, had, settled, during, the, ostsiedlung, except, part, of, eastern, austria, and, especially, eastern, germany, during, the, 4th, and, 5th, centuries, in, what, is, known, as, the, migration, period, germanic, peoples, seized, control, of, the, decaying, western, roman, empire, in, the, south, and, established, new, kingdoms, within, it, meanwhile, formerly, germanic, areas, in, eastern, europe, and, present, day, eastern, germany, were, settled, by, slavs, charlemagne, ruler, of, the, carolingian, empire, of, francia, which, was, founded, by, franks, a, germanic, people, under, whom, most, of, western, and, central, continental, europe, had, been, united, during, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, created, numerous, border, territories, so, called, marches, german, marken, where, a, substantial, portion, of, the, ostsiedlung, would, later, take, place, the, territories, from, north, to, south, this, was, the, earliest, recorded, and, planned, eastern, policy, under, charlemagne, who, wanted, to, protect, the, eastern, border, of, the, frankish, empire, and, also, wanted, to, solidify, his, position, in, the, east, by, declaring, war, on, the, obotrites, and, wilzes, in, the, north, as, well, as, on, the, sorbs, east, of, thuringia, and, czech, tribal, princes, however, since, the, goal, wasn, t, to, establish, an, ethnic, and, linguistic, boundary, between, the, slavs, and, germanic, tribes, slavic, settlement, continued, in, thuringia, and, northern, bavaria, with, individual, slavs, even, making, it, to, the, rhine, basin, the, tribes, that, populated, these, marches, were, generally, unreliable, allies, of, the, empire, and, successor, kings, led, numerous, yet, not, always, successful, military, campaigns, to, maintain, their, authority, in, 843, the, carolingian, empire, was, partitioned, into, three, independent, kingdoms, as, a, result, of, dissent, among, charlemagne, s, three, grandsons, over, the, continuation, of, the, custom, of, partible, inheritance, or, the, introduction, of, primogeniture, louis, the, german, inherited, the, eastern, territories, east, francia, that, included, all, lands, east, of, the, rhine, river, and, to, the, north, of, italy, which, roughly, corresponded, with, the, territories, of, the, german, stem, duchies, that, formed, a, federation, under, the, first, king, henry, the, fowler, 919, to, 936, the, slavs, living, within, the, reach, of, east, francia, since, 962, c, e, the, holy, roman, empire, collectively, called, wends, or, elbe, slavs, seldom, formed, larger, political, entities, they, rather, constituted, various, small, tribes, settling, as, far, west, as, to, a, line, from, the, eastern, alps, and, bohemia, to, the, saale, and, elbe, rivers, as, the, east, frankish, kingdom, expanded, various, wendish, tribes, that, were, conquered, or, allied, with, the, eastern, franks, such, as, the, obotrites, aided, the, franks, in, defeating, the, west, germanic, saxons, the, carolingian, tradition, of, setting, up, marches, at, the, periphery, of, the, empire, would, be, continued, by, the, east, frankish, and, holy, roman, empire, s, kings, during, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, under, the, rule, of, king, louis, the, german, and, arnulf, of, carinthia, the, first, groups, of, civilian, catholic, settlers, were, led, by, franks, and, bavarii, to, the, lands, of, pannonia, present, day, burgenland, hungary, slovakia, and, slovenia, in, a, series, of, punitive, actions, large, territories, in, the, northeast, between, the, elbe, saale, naab, rivers, in, the, west, and, the, oder, bober, kwisa, and, vltava, rivers, in, the, east, were, conquered, see, also, battle, on, the, raxa, and, border, marches, were, established, in, these, areas, fortifications, were, occupied, and, new, castles, built, reinforced, by, military, units, to, exert, military, control, and, collect, tributes, no, civilian, settlers, occupied, these, lands, christianization, was, limited, to, the, establishment, of, mission, dioceses, such, as, l, beck, brandenburg, or, havelberg, the, development, of, a, parish, church, system, only, took, place, after, the, settlement, of, german, colonists, beginning, in, the, 2nd, half, of, the, 12th, century, control, over, areas, that, had, already, been, conquered, was, repeatedly, lost, the, slavic, revolt, of, 983, and, an, uprising, of, the, obotrites, in, 1066, had, particularly, serious, consequences, in, 983, the, polabian, slavs, in, the, billung, and, northern, marches, stretching, from, the, elbe, river, to, the, baltic, sea, succeeded, in, a, rebellion, against, the, political, rule, and, christian, mission, of, the, recently, established, holy, roman, empire, in, spite, of, their, new, won, independence, the, obotrites, rani, liutizian, and, hevelli, tribes, were, soon, faced, with, internal, struggles, and, warfare, as, well, as, raids, from, the, newly, constituted, and, expanding, piast, dynasty, the, early, polish, state, from, the, east, denmark, from, the, north, and, the, empire, from, the, west, eager, to, reestablish, her, marches, the, area, remained, under, rule, of, the, polabian, tribes, and, uncolonized, and, unchristianized, into, the, 12th, century, the, territories, from, north, to, south, the, sorbian, march, east, of, the, saale, river, was, established, in, the, 9th, century, king, otto, i, designated, a, larger, area, the, saxon, eastern, march, in, 937, that, encompassed, the, territory, between, the, elbe, the, oder, and, the, peene, rivers, governed, by, margrave, gero, it, is, also, referred, to, as, marca, geronis, after, gero, s, death, in, 965, the, march, was, divided, in, smaller, sectors, northern, march, lusatian, march, margraviate, of, meissen, and, march, of, zeitz, the, march, was, populated, by, various, west, slavic, tribes, the, largest, being, polabian, slavs, tribes, in, the, north, and, sorbian, tribes, in, the, south, the, margravate, of, meissen, and, transylvania, were, populated, by, german, settlers, beginning, in, the, 12th, century, from, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, onwards, monasteries, and, cities, were, established, in, pomerania, brandenburg, silesia, bohemia, moravia, and, eastern, austria, in, the, baltics, the, teutonic, order, founded, a, crusader, state, in, the, beginning, of, the, 13th, century, a, call, for, a, crusade, against, the, wends, in, 1108, probably, coming, from, a, flemish, clerk, in, the, circles, of, the, archbishop, of, magdeburg, which, included, the, prospect, of, profitable, land, gains, for, new, settlers, had, no, noticeable, effect, and, resulted, in, neither, a, military, campaign, nor, a, movement, of, settlers, into, the, area, although, the, first, settlers, had, already, arrived, in, 1124, being, mostly, of, flemish, and, dutch, origin, they, settled, south, of, the, eider, river, followed, by, the, conquest, of, the, land, of, the, wagri, in, 1139, the, founding, of, l, beck, in, 1143, and, the, call, by, count, adolf, ii, of, schauenburg, to, settle, in, eastern, holstein, and, pomerania, in, the, same, year, weakened, by, ongoing, internal, conflicts, and, constant, warfare, the, independent, wendish, territories, finally, lost, the, capacity, to, provide, effective, military, resistance, from, 1119, to, 1123, pomerania, invaded, and, subdued, the, northeastern, parts, of, the, lutici, lands, in, 1124, and, 1128, wartislaw, i, duke, of, pomerania, at, that, time, a, vassal, of, poland, invited, bishop, otto, of, bamberg, to, christianize, the, pomeranians, and, liutizians, of, his, duchy, in, 1147, as, a, campaign, of, the, northern, crusades, the, wendish, crusade, was, mounted, in, the, duchy, of, saxony, to, retake, the, marches, lost, in, 983, the, crusaders, also, headed, for, pomeranian, demmin, and, szczecin, despite, these, areas, having, already, been, successfully, christianized, the, crusade, caused, widespread, devastation, and, slaughter, this, created, ideal, conditions, for, german, settlement, some, of, the, most, prominent, supporters, of, settlement, included, william, iv, who, had, purchased, small, amounts, of, land, on, the, frontier, of, pomerania, and, wichmann, von, seeburg, in, 1152, the, large, numbers, of, flemish, and, dutch, people, were, introduced, to, the, unoccupied, and, uncultivated, marshlands, just, east, of, magdeburg, near, the, havel, they, founded, the, cities, of, fl, ming, and, j, terbog, henry, the, lion, also, settled, mecklenburg, with, a, large, number, of, flemish, people, with, the, formation, of, the, hanseatic, league, which, allowed, further, german, settlement, in, coastal, towns, due, to, it, being, the, dominant, trade, republic, in, the, baltic, and, north, seas, after, the, wendish, crusade, albert, the, bear, was, able, to, establish, and, expand, the, margraviate, of, brandenburg, in, 1157, on, approximately, the, territory, of, the, former, northern, march, which, since, 983, had, been, controlled, by, the, hevelli, and, lutici, tribes, the, bishopric, of, havelberg, that, had, been, occupied, by, revolting, lutici, tribes, was, reestablished, to, christianize, the, wends, in, 1164, after, saxon, duke, henry, the, lion, finally, defeated, rebellious, obotrites, and, pomeranian, dukes, in, the, battle, of, verchen, the, pomeranian, duchies, of, demmin, and, stettin, became, saxon, fiefs, as, well, as, the, obodrite, territories, which, became, mecklenburg, named, after, the, obotrites, residential, capital, mecklenburg, castle, after, henry, the, lion, lost, his, internal, struggle, with, emperor, frederick, i, mecklenburg, and, pomerania, became, fiefs, of, the, holy, roman, empire, in, 1181, although, the, latter, briefly, as, it, passed, under, danish, suzerainty, in, 1185, and, then, under, imperial, again, only, in, the, 13th, century, german, influence, in, bohemia, began, when, duke, spytihn, v, i, freed, himself, from, moravian, vassalage, and, instead, paid, homage, to, the, east, frankish, king, arnulf, of, carinthia, at, the, imperial, diet, reichstag, in, regensburg, in, 895, in, 973, when, the, bishopric, of, prague, was, created, it, was, made, subject, to, the, archbishopric, of, mainz, which, increased, german, influence, in, the, 11th, century, bretislav, i, led, a, campaign, against, poland, reconquering, silesia, and, transferring, the, relics, of, saint, adalbert, to, prague, hoping, to, have, prague, elevated, to, archbishopric, status, this, resulted, in, a, military, conflict, with, the, german, king, henry, iii, and, in, the, end, bretislav, had, to, renounce, his, conquests, in, poland, and, recognize, henry, as, his, sovereign, after, this, bohemia, remained, loyal, to, germany, because, of, fears, of, another, invasion, and, polish, and, hungarian, expansionism, to, the, north, and, south, on, the, epoch, of, the, war, of, investiture, in, germany, henry, iv, decisively, fixed, german, bohemian, relationship, by, playing, off, the, polish, bohemian, enmity, in, 1080, vratislav, i, fighting, under, the, banner, of, the, emperor, captured, the, golden, lance, of, the, papal, counter, king, rudolf, of, swabia, at, the, battle, of, flarchheim, bohemia, s, reward, for, this, loyalty, came, six, years, later, in, 1086, when, henry, iv, elevated, the, duke, to, the, rank, of, king, all, of, this, laid, the, perfect, conditions, for, german, settlement, and, dominance, of, bohemia, german, settlers, mainly, traders, miners, farmers, and, monks, the, trade, fairs, of, prague, attracted, many, merchants, from, all, over, europe, with, many, including, the, germans, settling, in, prague, and, even, making, up, almost, a, quarter, of, all, people, in, prague, bretislav, ii, granted, them, important, privileges, notably, the, right, of, self, government, under, magistrates, of, their, own, election, and, the, right, of, living, under, german, law, during, the, late, 12th, and, early, 13th, century, german, settlement, of, the, mountainous, borderland, known, as, the, sudetenland, began, it, was, caused, by, the, successful, settlement, of, modern, day, northeastern, germany, the, mountainous, area, settled, first, was, the, eger, valley, partially, due, to, its, southern, edges, coming, under, the, control, of, diepold, iii, who, was, an, ally, of, holy, roman, emperor, frederick, barbarossa, furthermore, the, monastery, of, waldsassen, owned, extensive, land, in, the, eger, valley, the, first, german, villages, were, penerit, and, neudorf, both, founded, in, 1196, bavarians, and, austrians, settled, the, southern, edge, east, franks, the, middle, edge, and, saxon, miners, the, northern, edge, notably, the, erzgebirge, unlike, in, mecklenburg, pomerania, brandenburg, and, silesia, the, german, settlement, was, not, as, heavy, nor, were, many, czechs, assimilated, like, in, eastern, germany, as, german, influence, grew, with, greater, numbers, of, settlers, arriving, each, year, sob, slav, ii, felt, it, was, necessary, to, protect, the, czechs, from, germany, asking, henry, ii, duke, of, austria, to, renounce, his, claims, to, certain, bohemian, lands, this, was, refused, and, in, the, war, that, followed, he, was, defeated, this, made, sob, slavs, successors, frederick, and, conrad, ii, ruling, during, a, period, of, unrest, this, allowed, for, greater, settlement, during, the, 13th, century, where, even, many, czech, towns, received, so, many, german, settlers, they, were, practically, germanized, and, became, majority, germany, due, to, the, german, influence, on, the, nobility, many, castles, and, villages, names, were, germanized, such, as, zv, kov, castle, to, burg, klingenberg, under, the, reign, of, vladislaus, ii, various, military, orders, the, most, prominent, of, which, the, knights, hospitaller, were, even, allowed, to, bring, german, settlers, into, bohemian, land, and, settle, them, during, this, time, german, settlers, were, exempt, from, the, local, upan, laws, which, included, various, duties, such, as, the, upkeep, of, local, infrastructure, in, 1219, litom, ice, german, leitmeritz, was, the, first, german, town, to, be, given, the, privileges, of, the, magdeburg, laws, in, bohemia, during, the, 13th, 14th, century, as, much, as, 1, out, of, every, 6th, german, settlers, was, going, to, bohemia, while, this, is, lower, than, in, upper, saxony, lusatia, and, lower, silesia, it, s, still, a, substantial, number, eventually, during, the, late, 14th, and, early, 15th, centuries, settlement, slowed, down, due, to, numerous, factors, such, as, the, black, plague, in, germany, and, the, hussite, wars, the, teutonic, state, was, formed, in, the, aftermath, of, the, livonian, crusade, prussian, crusade, and, in, general, the, northern, crusades, in, the, territories, of, prussia, pomerelia, and, livonia, it, was, established, on, february, 2, 1207, as, a, principality, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, proclaimed, by, pope, innocent, iii, in, 1215, as, a, subject, to, the, holy, see, the, teutonic, state, established, a, comprehensive, administrative, structure, and, modernized, the, old, traditional, tribal, structure, of, the, region, an, integral, part, of, the, order, other, than, converting, pagans, to, christianity, was, also, to, encourage, germans, to, settle, the, sparsely, populated, area, most, german, settlers, primarily, went, to, urban, cities, such, as, graudenz, grudzi, dz, elbing, elbl, g, and, riga, the, settlers, also, established, numerous, rural, settlements, known, as, vorwerke, in, german, most, of, the, settlers, came, from, the, rhineland, region, the, teutonic, order, established, numerous, castles, and, other, holdings, near, populated, places, such, as, kaliningrad, to, consolidate, the, conquered, lands, while, east, prussia, was, heavily, settled, and, germanized, livonia, still, had, a, very, small, german, population, because, there, were, no, attempts, to, settle, inland, the, germans, in, livonia, were, mainly, employees, of, the, teutonic, order, there, for, administrative, purposes, or, merchants, of, the, hanseatic, league, who, settled, coastal, towns, while, hungary, was, never, conquered, by, the, holy, roman, empire, and, was, never, in, focus, of, german, settlement, it, still, had, a, sizeable, german, population, during, the, 11th, century, stephen, i, of, hungary, invited, german, priests, abbots, and, churchmen, to, found, monasteries, and, promote, the, conversion, of, hungary, eventually, these, germans, descendants, started, to, fill, other, occupations, becoming, merchants, clerks, and, farmers, etc, and, were, granted, the, status, of, free, peasants, in, 1149, g, za, ii, invited, german, settlers, to, southern, transylvania, written, records, call, them, flamands, teutons, and, latins, the, term, saxons, appeared, in, 1206, and, became, the, official, term, for, local, germans, in, 1231, the, term, represented, legal, status, rather, than, nationality, the, transylvanian, saxons, have, diverse, origins, their, pottery, art, and, liturgy, were, not, uniform, in, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, more, germans, arrived, in, hungary, living, in, dispersed, villages, known, as, k, nigsboden, by, the, mid, 13th, century, their, importance, in, trade, especially, in, pozsony, pest, and, nagyszombat, and, gold, and, silver, mining, especially, in, beszterce, and, radna, grew, significant, when, stephen, i, married, gisela, of, bavaria, many, german, knights, came, to, hungary, joining, its, military, they, were, often, rewarded, with, large, estates, and, entry, into, the, nobility, in, 1224, andrew, ii, signed, a, charter, laying, out, the, duties, and, rights, of, the, germans, in, the, kingdom, the, king, defined, their, duties, such, as, the, payment, of, tax, military, service, and, housing, of, the, king, and, his, officials, in, exchange, they, were, able, to, elect, their, priests, and, officials, independently, and, their, merchants, were, exempt, from, customs, duties, their, markets, were, also, not, taxed, no, outsider, was, allowed, to, receive, villages, or, estates, in, german, land, where, only, the, monarch, and, the, count, of, hermannstadt, had, jurisdiction, political, and, military, events, were, greatly, influenced, by, a, massive, population, increase, throughout, europe, in, the, high, middle, ages, from, the, 11th, to, the, 13th, centuries, the, population, in, the, kingdom, of, germany, increased, from, about, four, to, twelve, million, inhabitants, during, this, time, the, high, medieval, landesausbau, inland, settlement, took, place, when, arable, land, was, largely, expanded, at, the, expense, of, forested, areas, although, new, land, was, won, and, numerous, settlements, created, demands, could, not, be, absorbed, another, factor, was, a, surplus, of, offspring, of, the, nobility, who, were, not, entitled, to, inheritance, but, after, the, success, of, the, first, crusade, took, their, chances, of, acquiring, new, lands, in, the, peripheral, regions, of, the, empire, there, is, no, doubt, that, there, were, rather, numerous, german, settlers, in, eastern, central, who, were, responsible, for, bringing, german, law, in, the, earliest, stages, of, the, colonization, other, settlers, included, walloons, jews, dutch, flemish, and, later, poles, especially, in, the, territory, of, modern, ukraine, the, migration, of, the, walser, in, the, territory, of, present, day, switzerland, to, areas, that, had, formerly, been, inhabited, by, romans, the, walser, settlers, left, their, homes, in, valais, and, founded, villages, in, the, uplands, of, the, alp, valleys, in, the, north, of, italy, and, in, the, grisons, the, medieval, warm, period, which, began, in, the, 11th, century, resulted, in, higher, average, temperatures, in, central, europe, additional, technical, progress, in, agriculture, for, example, through, the, construction, of, mills, three, field, farming, and, increased, cultivation, of, grain, graining, led, to, general, population, increase, the, new, settlers, not, only, brought, their, customs, and, language, with, them, but, also, new, technical, skills, and, equipment, that, were, adapted, within, a, few, decades, especially, in, agriculture, and, crafts, these, included, the, amount, of, cultivated, land, increased, as, large, forested, areas, were, cleared, the, extent, of, land, increase, differed, by, region, in, silesia, it, had, doubled, 16, of, the, total, area, by, the, beginning, of, the, 11th, century, 30, in, the, 16th, century, and, the, highest, increase, rates, in, the, 14th, century, the, total, area, of, arable, land, increased, seven, to, twentyfold, in, many, silesian, regions, during, the, ostsiedlung, parallel, to, agricultural, innovations, new, forms, of, farm, layout, and, settlement, structuring, division, and, classification, of, land, were, introduced, farmland, was, divided, into, hufen, english, hides, and, larger, villages, replaced, the, previously, dominant, type, of, small, villages, consisting, of, four, to, eight, farms, as, a, complete, transformation, of, the, previous, settlement, structure, occurred, the, cultural, landscape, of, east, central, europe, formed, by, the, medieval, settlement, processes, essentially, prevails, until, today, flemish, and, dutch, settlers, were, among, the, first, to, immigrate, to, mecklenburg, at, the, beginning, of, the, 12th, century, in, the, following, years, they, moved, further, east, to, pomerania, and, silesia, and, in, the, south, to, hungary, motivated, by, the, lack, of, settlement, areas, in, their, already, largely, developed, home, areas, and, several, flood, disasters, and, famines, experienced, and, skilled, hydraulic, engineers, they, were, in, high, demand, at, the, settlements, of, the, as, yet, undeveloped, areas, east, of, the, elbe, the, land, was, drained, by, creating, a, network, like, structure, of, smaller, drainage, ditches, that, drained, the, water, in, main, ditches, roads, connecting, the, settlers, individual, farms, ran, along, these, main, trenches, dutch, settlers, were, recruited, by, the, local, rulers, in, large, numbers, especially, during, the, second, half, of, the, 12th, century, in, 1159, 60, for, example, albert, the, bear, granted, dutch, settlers, the, right, to, take, possession, of, former, slavic, settlements, the, preacher, helmold, of, bosau, reported, on, this, in, his, slavic, chronicle, finally, when, the, slavs, were, gradually, dispersing, he, albrecht, sent, to, utrecht, and, the, rhine, region, and, also, to, those, who, live, by, the, ocean, who, under, the, power, of, the, sea, had, suffered, the, dutch, zealanders, and, flemings, where, he, attracted, a, lot, of, people, and, let, them, live, in, the, castles, and, villages, of, the, slavs, the, slavs, used, ploughs, and, agricultural, implements, before, the, arrival, of, german, settlers, the, oldest, meaningful, reference, to, this, can, be, found, in, a, slavic, chronicle, in, which, the, use, of, a, plough, as, an, areal, measurement, is, mentioned, although, heavier, and, useful, ploughs, were, brought, by, the, settlers, in, the, 12th, and, 13th, century, documents, the, ard, without, a, mouldboard, is, mentioned, it, tear, opens, the, soil, and, spreads, the, soil, to, both, sides, without, turning, it, it, is, therefore, particularly, suitable, for, light, and, sandy, subsoil, in, the, mid, 13th, century, the, three, field, system, was, introduced, east, of, the, elbe, this, new, cultivation, method, required, the, use, of, the, heavy, mouldboard, plough, that, digs, up, the, earth, deeply, and, turns, it, around, in, a, single, operation, the, different, modes, of, operation, of, the, two, devices, also, had, an, impact, on, the, shape, and, size, of, the, cultivation, areas, the, fields, worked, with, the, ard, had, about, the, same, field, length, and, width, and, a, square, base, long, fields, with, a, rectangular, base, were, much, more, suitable, for, the, mouldboard, plough, as, the, heavy, implements, had, to, be, turned, less, often, planting, and, cultivation, of, oats, and, rye, was, promoted, and, soon, these, cereals, became, the, most, important, type, of, grain, farmers, who, used, mouldboard, ploughs, were, required, to, pay, double, tax, fees, potters, were, among, the, first, group, of, artisans, who, also, settled, in, the, rural, areas, typical, slavic, ceramics, were, the, flat, bottom, vessels, with, the, influx, of, western, settlers, new, vessel, shapes, such, as, the, rounded, jar, were, introduced, inclusive, hard, fired, processes, that, improved, ceramics, quality, this, type, of, ceramics, known, as, hard, grayware, became, widespread, east, of, the, elbe, by, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, it, was, manufactured, extensively, in, pomerania, by, the, 13th, century, when, more, advanced, manufacturing, methods, such, as, the, tunnel, kiln, enabled, the, mass, production, of, ceramic, household, goods, the, demand, for, household, goods, such, as, pots, jugs, jugs, and, bowls, which, had, previously, been, made, of, wood, increased, steadily, and, promoted, the, development, of, new, sales, markets, during, the, 13th, century, glazed, ceramics, were, introduced, and, the, import, of, stoneware, increased, the, transfer, of, technology, and, knowledge, affected, the, way, of, life, of, old, and, new, settlers, in, a, variety, of, ways, and, in, addition, to, innovations, in, agriculture, and, handicrafts, also, included, other, areas, such, as, weapons, technology, documents, and, coins, the, slavic, population, sorbs, who, lived, east, of, the, elbe, primarily, built, log, houses, which, had, proven, suitable, for, the, regional, climates, and, wood, was, plentiful, in, the, continental, regions, the, german, settlers, mainly, from, franconia, and, thuringia, who, advanced, into, the, area, in, the, 13th, century, brought, with, them, the, half, timbering, style, which, was, already, known, to, the, germanic, peoples, as, a, wood, saving, solid, and, stable, construction, method, that, allowed, multi, storey, buildings, a, combination, of, the, two, construction, methods, was, difficult, because, the, horizontally, stacked, wood, of, the, log, room, expands, differently, in, height, than, the, vertical, posts, of, the, framework, the, result, was, the, new, type, of, half, timbered, house, with, a, timber, frame, around, the, ground, floor, block, capable, to, support, a, second, floor, which, was, made, of, half, timber, the, ostsiedlung, followed, an, immediate, rapid, population, growth, throughout, central, and, eastern, europe, during, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, the, population, density, increased, considerably, the, increase, was, due, to, the, influx, of, settlers, on, the, one, hand, and, an, increase, in, slavic, populations, after, the, settlement, on, the, other, hand, settlement, was, the, primary, reason, for, the, increase, e, g, in, the, areas, east, of, the, oder, the, duchy, of, pomerania, western, greater, poland, silesia, austria, moravia, prussia, and, transylvania, while, in, the, larger, part, of, central, and, eastern, europe, indigenous, populations, were, responsible, for, the, growth, author, piskorski, wrote, that, insofar, as, it, is, possible, to, draw, conclusions, from, the, less, than, rich, medieval, source, material, it, appears, that, at, least, in, some, east, central, european, territories, the, population, increased, significantly, it, is, however, possible, to, contest, to, what, extent, this, was, a, direct, result, of, migration, and, how, far, it, was, due, to, increased, agricultural, productivity, and, the, gathering, pace, of, urbanization, in, contrast, to, western, europe, this, increased, population, was, largely, spared, by, the, 14th, century, black, death, pandemic, with, the, german, settlers, new, systems, of, taxation, arrived, while, the, existing, wendish, tithe, was, a, fixed, tax, depending, on, village, size, the, german, tithe, depended, on, the, actual, crop, yield, thus, higher, taxes, were, collected, from, the, settlers, than, from, the, wends, although, settlers, were, partly, exempted, from, tax, payments, during, the, first, years, after, settlement, establishment, the, development, of, germania, slavica, was, also, associated, with, the, establishment, of, towns, there, already, existed, slavic, castle, towns, in, which, merchant, quarters, formed, suburbs, at, fortified, strongholds, grads, wendish, scandinavian, merchants, founded, manufacturing, and, trading, settlements, emporia, at, the, baltic, coast, large, cities, included, szczecin, which, reached, 9, 000, inhabitants, krak, w, and, wroc, aw, major, cities, and, centers, of, power, of, medieval, poland, however, they, experienced, substantial, growth, since, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, through, new, settlers, and, expansion, locatio, civitatis, the, foundation, of, a, bishopric, for, example, in, havelberg, would, lead, to, the, development, of, a, town, although, cities, were, also, founded, out, of, nowhere, such, as, neubrandenburg, characteristic, of, the, founding, cities, are, geometrical, or, rasterized, floor, plans, with, main, streets, intersecting, axes, and, a, central, market, place, different, settlement, phases, are, reflected, in, twin, cities, names, such, as, new, town, or, old, town, the, towns, established, during, the, ostsiedlung, were, free, towns, civitates, liberae, or, called, new, towns, by, its, contemporaries, the, rapid, increase, in, the, number, of, towns, led, to, an, urbanization, of, east, central, europe, the, new, towns, differed, from, their, predecessors, in, the, granting, of, city, rights, played, an, important, role, in, attracting, german, settlers, the, town, charter, privileged, the, new, residents, and, existing, suburban, settlements, with, a, market, were, given, formal, town, charter, and, then, rebuilt, or, expanded, even, small, settlements, inhabited, by, native, people, would, eventually, be, granted, these, new, rights, regardless, of, existing, suburban, settlements, locators, were, commissioned, to, establish, completely, new, cities, as, the, goal, was, to, attract, as, many, people, as, possible, in, order, to, create, new, flourishing, population, centers, among, the, many, different, german, city, laws, the, magdeburg, law, and, the, l, beck, law, played, the, greatest, role, in, the, new, settlements, as, they, served, often, in, more, or, less, modified, form, as, models, for, most, cities, other, city, rights, that, were, of, regional, importance, include, the, nuremberg, law, the, mecklenburg, law, and, the, iglau, law, the, l, beck, law, of, 1188, served, in, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, as, the, model, for, around, 100, cities, in, the, entire, baltic, sea, trading, area, around, 350, 000, people, lived, under, l, beck, law, in, the, early, 15th, century, the, magdeburg, law, which, has, its, origins, in, the, privileges, granted, by, archbishop, wichmann, of, magdeburg, first, spread, into, brandenburg, saxony, and, lusatia, laws, based, on, the, magdeburg, model, for, example, the, kulm, che, mno, law, and, neumarkt, roda, law, were, introduced, in, poland, including, silesia, the, state, of, the, teutonic, order, bohemia, and, moravia, and, beyond, the, pagan, wends, had, been, the, target, of, christianization, attempts, before, the, beginning, of, the, ostsiedlung, since, the, government, of, emperor, otto, i, and, the, establishment, of, dioceses, east, of, the, elbe, the, slav, uprising, of, 983, put, an, end, to, these, efforts, for, almost, 200, years, in, contrast, to, the, czechs, and, poles, who, had, been, christianized, before, the, turn, of, the, millennium, the, conversion, attempts, of, the, elbe, slavs, were, initially, accompanied, by, violence, the, arrival, of, new, settlers, from, around, 1150, on, led, to, a, civil, christianization, of, the, areas, between, the, elbe, and, oder, the, new, settlers, first, built, wooden, and, later, field, stone, parish, churches, in, their, villages, some, places, of, worship, such, as, the, st, mary, in, brandenburg, and, the, lehnin, abbey, were, built, on, pagan, shrines, the, cistercians, who, had, been, assigned, a, prominent, role, by, church, authorities, combined, the, spread, of, faith, and, settlement, development, their, monasteries, with, extensive, international, connections, played, a, vital, role, in, the, development, of, the, communities, the, majority, of, the, settlers, were, germans, of, the, holy, roman, empire, significant, numbers, of, dutch, settlers, participated, particularly, in, the, early, 12th, century, in, the, area, surrounding, the, middle, elbe, river, to, a, lesser, extent, danes, scots, or, local, wends, and, french, speaking, walloons, participated, as, well, among, the, settlers, were, landless, children, of, noble, families, who, could, not, inherit, property, besides, the, marches, adjacent, to, the, empire, germans, settled, in, areas, farther, east, such, as, the, carpathians, transylvania, and, along, the, gulf, of, riga, settlers, were, invited, by, local, secular, rulers, such, as, dukes, counts, margraves, princes, and, only, in, a, few, cases, due, to, the, weakening, central, power, the, king, the, sovereigns, in, east, central, europe, owned, large, territories, of, which, only, small, portions, were, arable, which, generated, very, little, income, the, lords, offered, considerable, privileges, to, new, settlers, from, the, empire, starting, in, the, border, marks, the, princes, invited, people, from, the, empire, by, granting, them, land, ownership, and, improved, legal, status, binding, duties, and, the, inheritance, of, the, farm, the, landowners, eventually, benefited, from, these, rather, generous, conditions, for, the, farmers, and, generated, income, from, the, land, that, had, previously, been, fallow, most, sovereigns, transferred, the, specific, recruitment, of, settlers, the, distribution, of, the, land, and, the, establishment, of, the, settlements, to, so, called, lokators, allocator, of, land, these, men, who, usually, came, from, the, lower, nobility, or, the, urban, bourgeoisie, organized, the, settlement, trains, that, included, advertising, equipment, and, transport, land, clearing, and, preparation, of, the, settlements, locator, contracts, settled, rights, and, obligations, of, the, locators, and, the, new, settlers, towns, were, founded, and, granted, german, town, law, the, agricultural, legal, administrative, and, technical, methods, of, the, immigrants, as, well, as, their, successful, christianization, of, the, native, inhabitants, led, to, a, gradual, transformation, of, the, settlement, areas, as, slavic, communities, adopted, german, culture, german, cultural, and, linguistic, influence, lasted, in, some, of, these, areas, right, up, to, the, present, day, in, the, mid, 14th, century, the, migration, process, slowed, considerably, as, a, result, of, the, black, death, the, population, probably, decreased, by, that, time, and, economically, marginal, settlements, were, left, in, particular, at, the, coast, of, pomerania, and, western, prussia, only, a, century, later, local, slavic, leaders, of, pomerania, western, prussia, and, silesia, invited, german, settlers, again, settlement, was, the, pretext, for, assimilation, processes, that, lasted, centuries, assimilation, occurred, in, both, directions, depending, on, the, region, and, the, majority, population, slavic, and, german, settlers, mutually, assimilated, each, other, the, polonization, process, of, german, settlers, in, krak, w, and, pozna, lasted, about, two, centuries, the, community, could, only, continue, its, isolated, position, with, a, continuation, of, newcomers, from, german, lands, the, sorbs, also, assimilated, german, settlers, yet, at, the, same, time, small, sorbic, communities, were, themselves, assimilated, by, the, surrounding, german, speaking, population, many, central, and, eastern, european, towns, developed, into, multi, ethnic, melting, pots, although, slavic, population, density, was, generally, not, very, high, compared, to, the, empire, and, had, as, a, result, of, the, extensive, warfare, during, the, 10th, to, 12th, centuries, even, further, declined, some, settlement, centers, maintained, their, wendish, populations, to, varying, degrees, resisting, assimilation, for, a, long, time, in, the, territories, of, pomerania, and, silesia, german, migrants, did, not, settle, in, the, old, slavic, polish, villages, and, set, up, new, ones, on, grounds, allotted, to, them, by, the, slavic, polish, dukes, and, the, monastic, clergy, in, the, marches, west, of, the, oder, the, wends, were, occasionally, driven, out, and, the, villages, rebuilt, by, settlers, the, new, villages, would, nevertheless, keep, their, former, slavic, names, in, the, case, of, the, village, b, belin, in, mecklenburg, the, evicted, wendish, inhabitants, repeatedly, invaded, their, former, village, hindering, a, resettlement, in, the, sorbian, march, the, situation, was, again, different, as, the, area, and, in, particular, upper, lusatia, is, situated, close, to, bohemia, ruled, by, a, slavic, dynasty, a, loyal, and, powerful, duchy, of, the, empire, in, this, environment, german, feudal, lords, often, cooperated, with, the, slavic, inhabitants, wiprecht, of, groitzsch, a, prominent, figure, during, the, early, german, migration, period, only, acquired, local, power, through, the, marriage, to, a, slavic, noblewoman, and, the, support, of, the, bohemian, king, german, slavic, relations, were, generally, good, while, relations, between, slavic, governed, bohemia, and, slavic, governed, poland, were, marred, by, constant, struggle, discrimination, against, the, wends, was, not, a, part, of, the, general, concept, of, the, ostsiedlung, rather, the, wends, were, subject, to, a, low, taxation, mode, and, thus, not, as, profitable, as, new, settlers, even, though, the, majority, of, the, settlers, were, germans, franks, and, bavarians, in, the, south, and, saxons, and, flemings, in, the, north, wends, and, other, tribes, also, participated, in, the, settlement, new, settlers, were, not, chosen, just, because, of, their, ethnicity, a, concept, unknown, in, the, middle, ages, but, because, of, their, manpower, and, agricultural, and, technical, know, how, most, of, the, wends, were, gradually, assimilated, however, in, isolated, rural, areas, where, wends, constituted, a, substantial, part, of, the, population, they, continued, their, culture, these, were, the, drevani, polabians, of, the, wendland, east, of, the, l, neburg, heath, the, jabelheide, drevani, of, southern, mecklenburg, the, slovincians, and, kashubs, of, eastern, pomerania, and, the, sorbs, of, lusatia, lusatia, was, inhabited, by, a, large, population, of, sorbs, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, as, linguistic, assimilation, occurred, in, a, relatively, short, time, the, ostsiedlung, caused, the, adoption, of, loan, words, foreign, words, and, loan, translations, among, the, german, and, the, slavic, languages, direct, contact, between, germans, and, slavs, caused, direct, language, exchange, of, language, elements, due, to, the, bilingualism, of, people, or, the, spatial, proximity, of, the, speakers, of, the, respective, language, remote, contact, took, place, during, trade, travels, or, political, embassies, the, oldest, adoption, of, naming, units, dates, back, to, proto, germanic, and, proto, slavic, the, original, slavic, word, k, n, dz, can, be, found, in, almost, all, slavic, languages, german, was, mainly, used, to, convey, words, in, slavic, languages, that, related, to, handicraft, politics, agriculture, and, nutrition, this, includes, old, high, german, cihla, middle, high, german, ziegala, ziegel, brick, that, resulted, from, the, sound, shift, of, the, latin, tegula, an, example, of, borrowing, from, slavic, into, germanic, usage, is, the, word, for, border, in, middle, high, german, called, grenize, which, is, a, borrowing, of, the, old, czech, word, granic, or, the, polish, word, granica, city, names, are, also, affected, by, language, exchange, sound, shifting, and, the, slavic, second, palatalization, the, city, of, regensburg, is, called, ezno, in, czech, and, rez, no, in, proto, slavic, due, to, the, intensive, language, contact, idioms, were, also, transmitted, two, examples, from, czech, and, polish, are, na, vlastn, p, st, na, w, asn, r, k, on, your, own, or, ozbrojen, po, zuby, uzbrojony, po, z, by, armed, to, the, teeth, in, hungarian, saj, t, szak, ll, ra, one, s, own, beard, and, llig, felfegyverzett, armed, to, the, chin, with, different, wording, but, with, the, same, meaning, as, slavic, and, wendish, locality, names, were, widely, adopted, they, represent, in, adapted, and, further, developed, form, a, very, high, proportion, of, east, german, toponyms, and, place, names, these, are, recognizable, at, word, endings, such, as, ow, germanized, au, as, in, spandau, vitz, or, witz, and, sometimes, in, newly, created, villages, were, given, german, names, that, ended, for, example, with, dorf, or, hagen, in, the, north, and, rode, or, hain, in, the, south, the, name, of, the, settler, s, place, of, origin, example, lichtervelde, in, flanders, could, also, become, part, of, the, place, name, if, a, german, settlement, was, founded, alongside, a, wendish, settlement, the, name, of, the, wendendorf, could, also, be, adopted, for, the, german, village, the, distinction, was, then, made, through, additions, for, example, klein, or, wendisch, windisch, for, wendendorf, gro, or, deutsch, for, german, in, german, speaking, areas, most, inherited, surnames, were, formed, only, after, the, ostsiedlung, period, and, many, german, surnames, are, in, fact, germanized, wendish, placenames, the, former, ethnic, variety, of, german, deutsch, and, slavic, wendisch, b, hmisch, polnisch, toponyms, was, discontinued, by, the, eastern, european, republics, after, world, war, ii, villages, and, towns, were, renamed, in, slavic, only, memory, of, the, history, of, german, settlement, was, no, longer, appreciated, it, s, estimated, that, approximately, 25, of, all, german, family, names, are, of, slavic, origin, most, of, these, are, polish, there, is, no, clear, cause, nor, a, definite, end, point, in, time, of, the, ostsiedlung, however, a, slowdown, in, the, settlement, movement, can, be, observed, after, the, year, 1300, and, in, the, 14th, century, only, a, few, new, settlements, with, the, participation, of, german, speaking, settlers, were, founded, an, explanation, for, the, end, of, the, ostsiedlung, must, include, various, factors, without, being, able, to, clearly, weigh, or, differentiate, between, them, the, deterioration, of, the, climate, from, around, 1300, as, the, beginning, of, the, little, ice, age, the, agricultural, crisis, that, began, in, the, mid, 14th, century, in, the, wake, of, the, demographic, slump, caused, by, the, 1347, plague, profound, devastation, processes, have, taken, place, if, a, clear, connection, could, be, established, here, the, end, of, the, ostsiedlung, would, be, understood, as, part, of, the, crisis, of, the, 14th, century, in, the, 19th, century, recognition, of, this, complex, phenomenon, coupled, with, the, rise, of, nationalism, this, led, to, a, largely, unhistoric, ethnically, inspired, nationalist, reinterpretation, of, the, medieval, process, in, germany, and, some, slavic, countries, most, notably, poland, the, ostsiedlung, was, perceived, in, nationalist, circles, as, a, prelude, to, contemporary, expansionism, and, germanization, efforts, the, slogan, used, for, this, perception, was, drang, nach, osten, drive, or, push, to, the, east, the, german, settlement, processes, in, pomerania, did, not, follow, any, kind, of, ideology, nor, did, the, other, migratory, movements, rather, the, german, settlement, in, pomerania, was, shaped, exclusively, by, practical, requirements, the, national, historiography, that, established, itself, around, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, retrospectively, constructed, a, slavic, germanic, contrast, in, the, ostsiedlung, process, of, the, high, middle, ages, however, that, was, the, ideology, of, the, 19th, century, not, the, middle, ages, settlement, was, to, be, cuiuscunque, gentis, et, cuiuscunque, artis, homines, people, of, whatever, origin, and, whatever, craft, which, was, recorded, in, numerous, documents, issued, by, pomeranian, dukes, and, r, gish, princes, buchholz, the, 20th, century, wars, and, nationalist, policies, severely, altered, the, ethnic, and, cultural, composition, of, central, and, eastern, europe, after, world, war, i, germans, in, reconstituted, poland, were, set, under, pressure, to, leave, the, polish, corridor, the, eastern, part, of, upper, silesia, and, pozna, during, world, war, ii, the, nazis, initiated, the, nazi, soviet, population, transfers, wiping, out, the, old, settlement, areas, of, the, baltic, germans, the, germans, in, bessarabia, and, others, to, resettle, them, in, the, future, territories, in, occupied, poland, during, world, war, ii, the, generalplan, ost, was, launched, with, the, aim, of, extermitating, or, enslaving, poles, and, other, slavs, according, to, the, nazis, lebensraum, concept, in, order, to, press, the, territorial, claims, of, germany, and, to, demonstrate, supposed, german, superiority, over, non, germanic, peoples, the, latter, s, cultural, urban, and, scientific, achievements, in, that, era, were, undermined, rejected, or, presented, as, german, while, further, realization, of, this, mega, plan, aiming, at, a, total, reconstitution, of, central, and, eastern, europe, as, a, german, colony, was, prevented, by, the, war, s, turn, the, beginning, of, the, expulsion, of, 2, million, poles, and, settlement, of, volksdeutsche, in, the, annexed, territories, yet, was, implied, by, 1944, the, potsdam, conference, the, meeting, between, the, leaders, of, the, united, states, great, britain, and, the, soviet, union, sanctioned, the, expulsion, of, germans, from, czechoslovakia, poland, and, hungary, with, the, red, army, s, advance, and, nazi, germany, s, defeat, in, 1945, the, ethnic, make, up, of, central, and, eastern, and, east, central, europe, was, radically, changed, as, nearly, all, germans, were, expelled, not, only, from, all, soviet, conquered, german, settlement, areas, across, central, and, eastern, europe, but, also, from, former, territories, of, the, reich, east, of, the, oder, neisse, line, especially, the, provinces, of, silesia, east, prussia, east, brandenburg, and, pomerania, the, soviet, established, people, s, republic, of, poland, annexed, the, majority, of, the, lands, while, the, northern, half, of, east, prussia, was, taken, by, the, soviets, becoming, the, kaliningrad, oblast, an, exclave, of, the, russian, sfsr, the, former, german, settlement, areas, were, resettled, by, ethnic, citizens, of, the, respective, succeeding, state, czechs, in, the, former, sudetenland, and, poles, in, silesia, and, pomerania, however, some, areas, that, were, settled, and, germanized, in, the, course, of, the, ostsiedlung, still, form, the,
