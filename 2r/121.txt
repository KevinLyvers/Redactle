and, two, successive, iranian, empires, the, parthian, and, the, sasanian, battles, between, the, parthian, empire, and, the, roman, republic, began, in, 54, bc, wars, began, under, the, late, republic, and, continued, through, the, roman, later, eastern, roman, byzantine, and, sasanian, empires, a, plethora, of, vassal, kingdoms, and, allied, nomadic, nations, in, the, form, of, buffer, states, and, proxies, also, played, a, role, the, wars, were, ended, by, the, early, muslim, conquests, which, led, to, the, fall, of, the, sasanian, empire, and, huge, territorial, losses, for, the, byzantine, empire, shortly, after, the, end, of, the, last, war, between, them, although, warfare, between, the, romans, and, persians, continued, over, seven, centuries, the, frontier, aside, from, shifts, in, the, north, remained, largely, stable, a, game, of, tug, of, war, ensued, towns, fortifications, and, provinces, were, continually, sacked, captured, destroyed, and, traded, neither, side, had, the, logistical, strength, or, manpower, to, maintain, such, lengthy, campaigns, far, from, their, borders, and, thus, neither, could, advance, too, far, without, risking, stretching, its, frontiers, too, thin, both, sides, did, make, conquests, beyond, the, border, but, in, time, the, balance, was, almost, always, restored, although, initially, different, in, military, tactics, the, armies, of, both, sides, gradually, adopted, from, each, other, and, by, the, second, half, of, the, 6th, century, they, were, similar, and, evenly, matched, the, expense, of, resources, during, the, roman, persian, wars, ultimately, proved, catastrophic, for, both, empires, the, prolonged, and, escalating, warfare, of, the, 6th, and, 7th, centuries, left, them, exhausted, and, vulnerable, in, the, face, of, the, sudden, emergence, and, expansion, of, the, rashidun, caliphate, whose, forces, invaded, both, empires, only, a, few, years, after, the, end, of, the, last, roman, persian, war, benefiting, from, their, weakened, condition, the, rashidun, armies, swiftly, conquered, the, entire, sasanian, empire, and, deprived, the, eastern, roman, empire, of, its, territories, in, the, levant, the, caucasus, egypt, and, the, rest, of, north, africa, over, the, following, centuries, more, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, came, under, muslim, rule, according, to, james, howard, johnston, from, the, third, century, bc, to, the, early, seventh, century, ad, the, rival, players, were, grand, polities, with, imperial, pretensions, which, had, been, able, to, establish, and, secure, stable, territories, transcending, regional, divides, the, romans, and, parthians, came, into, contact, through, their, respective, conquests, of, parts, of, the, seleucid, empire, during, the, 3rd, century, bc, the, parthians, migrated, from, the, central, asian, steppe, into, northern, iran, although, subdued, for, a, time, by, the, seleucids, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, they, broke, away, and, established, an, independent, state, that, steadily, expanded, at, the, expense, of, their, former, rulers, and, through, the, course, of, the, 2nd, and, early, 1st, century, bc, they, had, conquered, persia, mesopotamia, and, armenia, ruled, by, the, arsacid, dynasty, the, parthians, fended, off, several, seleucid, attempts, to, regain, their, lost, territories, and, established, several, eponymous, branches, in, the, caucasus, namely, the, arsacid, dynasty, of, armenia, the, arsacid, dynasty, of, iberia, and, the, arsacid, dynasty, of, caucasian, albania, meanwhile, the, romans, expelled, the, seleucids, from, their, territories, in, anatolia, in, the, early, 2nd, century, bc, after, defeating, antiochus, iii, the, great, at, thermopylae, and, magnesia, finally, in, 64, bc, pompey, conquered, the, remaining, seleucid, territories, in, syria, extinguishing, their, state, and, advancing, the, roman, eastern, frontier, to, the, euphrates, where, it, met, the, territory, of, the, parthians, parthian, enterprise, in, the, west, began, in, the, time, of, mithridates, i, and, was, revived, by, mithridates, ii, who, negotiated, unsuccessfully, with, lucius, cornelius, sulla, for, a, roman, parthian, alliance, c, 105, bc, when, lucullus, invaded, southern, armenia, and, led, an, attack, against, tigranes, in, 69, bc, he, corresponded, with, phraates, iii, to, dissuade, him, from, intervening, although, the, parthians, remained, neutral, lucullus, considered, attacking, them, in, 66, 65, bc, pompey, reached, agreement, with, phraates, and, roman, parthian, troops, invaded, armenia, but, a, dispute, soon, arose, over, the, euphrates, boundary, finally, phraates, asserted, his, control, over, mesopotamia, except, for, the, western, district, of, osroene, which, became, a, roman, dependency, the, roman, general, marcus, licinius, crassus, led, an, invasion, of, mesopotamia, in, 53, bc, with, catastrophic, results, he, and, his, son, publius, were, killed, at, the, battle, of, carrhae, by, the, parthians, under, general, surena, this, was, the, worst, roman, defeat, since, the, battle, of, arausio, the, parthians, raided, syria, the, following, year, and, mounted, a, major, invasion, in, 51, bc, but, their, army, was, caught, in, an, ambush, near, antigonea, by, the, romans, and, they, were, driven, back, the, parthians, largely, remained, neutral, during, caesar, s, civil, war, fought, between, forces, supporting, julius, caesar, and, forces, supporting, pompey, and, the, traditional, faction, of, the, roman, senate, however, they, maintained, relations, with, pompey, and, after, his, defeat, and, death, a, force, under, pacorus, i, assisted, the, pompeian, general, q, caecilius, bassus, who, was, besieged, at, apamea, valley, by, caesarian, forces, with, the, civil, war, over, julius, caesar, prepared, a, campaign, against, parthia, but, his, assassination, averted, the, war, the, parthians, supported, brutus, and, cassius, during, the, ensuing, liberators, civil, war, and, sent, a, contingent, to, fight, on, their, side, at, the, battle, of, philippi, in, 42, bc, after, the, liberators, defeat, the, parthians, invaded, roman, territory, in, 40, bc, in, conjunction, with, the, roman, quintus, labienus, a, former, supporter, of, brutus, and, cassius, they, swiftly, overran, the, roman, province, of, syria, and, advanced, into, judea, overthrowing, the, roman, client, hyrcanus, ii, and, installing, his, nephew, antigonus, for, a, moment, the, whole, of, the, roman, east, seemed, lost, to, the, parthians, or, about, to, fall, into, their, hands, however, the, conclusion, of, the, second, roman, civil, war, soon, revived, roman, strength, in, asia, mark, antony, had, sent, ventidius, to, oppose, labienus, who, had, invaded, anatolia, soon, labienus, was, driven, back, to, syria, by, roman, forces, and, although, reinforced, by, the, parthians, was, defeated, taken, prisoner, and, killed, after, suffering, a, further, defeat, near, the, syrian, gates, the, parthians, withdrew, from, syria, they, returned, in, 38, bc, but, were, decisively, defeated, by, ventidius, and, pacorus, was, killed, in, judaea, antigonus, was, ousted, with, roman, help, by, herod, in, 37, bc, with, roman, control, of, syria, and, judaea, restored, mark, antony, led, a, huge, army, into, atropatene, but, his, siege, train, and, its, escort, were, isolated, and, wiped, out, while, his, armenian, allies, deserted, failing, to, make, progress, against, parthian, positions, the, romans, withdrew, with, heavy, casualties, antony, was, again, in, armenia, in, 33, bc, to, join, with, the, median, king, against, octavian, and, the, parthians, other, preoccupations, obliged, him, to, withdraw, and, the, whole, region, came, under, parthian, control, with, tensions, between, the, two, powers, threatening, renewed, war, octavian, and, phraataces, worked, out, a, compromise, in, 1, ad, according, to, the, agreement, parthia, undertook, to, withdraw, its, forces, from, armenia, and, to, recognize, a, de, facto, roman, protectorate, there, nonetheless, roman, persian, rivalry, over, control, and, influence, in, armenia, continued, unabated, for, the, next, several, decades, the, decision, of, the, parthian, king, artabanus, iii, to, place, his, son, on, the, vacant, armenian, throne, triggered, a, war, with, rome, in, 36, ad, which, ended, when, artabanus, iii, abandoned, claims, to, a, parthian, sphere, of, influence, in, armenia, war, erupted, in, 58, ad, after, the, parthian, king, vologases, i, forcibly, installed, his, brother, tiridates, on, the, armenian, throne, roman, forces, overthrew, tiridates, and, replaced, him, with, a, cappadocian, prince, triggering, an, inconclusive, war, this, came, to, an, end, in, 63, ad, after, the, romans, agreed, to, allow, tiridates, and, his, descendants, to, rule, armenia, on, condition, that, they, receive, the, kingship, from, the, roman, emperor, a, fresh, series, of, conflicts, began, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, during, which, the, romans, consistently, held, the, upper, hand, over, parthia, the, emperor, trajan, invaded, armenia, and, mesopotamia, during, 114, and, 115, and, annexed, them, as, roman, provinces, he, captured, the, parthian, capital, ctesiphon, before, sailing, downriver, to, the, persian, gulf, however, uprisings, erupted, in, 115, ad, in, the, occupied, parthian, territories, while, a, major, jewish, revolt, broke, out, in, roman, territory, severely, stretching, roman, military, resources, parthian, forces, attacked, key, roman, positions, and, the, roman, garrisons, at, seleucia, nisibis, and, edessa, were, expelled, by, the, local, inhabitants, trajan, subdued, the, rebels, in, mesopotamia, but, having, installed, the, parthian, prince, parthamaspates, on, the, throne, as, a, client, ruler, he, withdrew, his, armies, and, returned, to, syria, trajan, died, in, 117, before, he, was, able, to, reorganize, and, consolidate, roman, control, over, the, parthian, provinces, trajan, s, parthian, war, initiated, a, shift, of, emphasis, in, the, grand, strategy, of, the, roman, empire, but, his, successor, hadrian, decided, that, it, was, in, rome, s, interest, to, re, establish, the, euphrates, as, the, limit, of, its, direct, control, hadrian, returned, to, the, status, quo, ante, and, surrendered, the, territories, of, armenia, mesopotamia, and, adiabene, to, their, previous, rulers, and, client, kings, war, over, armenia, broke, out, again, in, 161, when,

a, favored, candidate, on, the, armenian, throne, the, following, year, avidius, cassius, invaded, mesopotamia, winning, battles, at, dura, europos, and, seleucia, and, sacking, ctesiphon, in, 165, an, epidemic, which, was, sweeping, parthia, at, the, time, possibly, of, smallpox, spread, to, the, roman, army, and, forced, its, withdrawal, this, was, the, origin, of, the, antonine, plague, that, raged, for, a, generation, throughout, the, roman, empire, in, 195, 197, a, roman, offensive, under, the, emperor, septimius, severus, led, to, rome, s, acquisition, of, northern, mesopotamia, as, far, as, the, areas, around, nisibis, singara, and, the, third, sacking, of, ctesiphon, a, final, war, against, the, parthians, was, launched, by, the, emperor, caracalla, who, sacked, arbela, in, 216, after, his, assassination, his, successor, macrinus, was, defeated, by, the, parthians, near, nisibis, in, exchange, for, peace, he, was, obliged, to, pay, for, the, damage, caused, by,

column, of, his, army, marched, into, armenia, while, two, other, columns, operated, to, the, south, and, failed, in, 238, 240, towards, the, end, of, his, reign, ardashir, attacked, again, taking, several, cities, in, syria, and, mesopotamia, including, carrhae, nisibis, and, hatra, the, struggle, resumed, and, intensified, under, ardashir, s, successor, shapur, i, he, invaded, mesopotamia, and, captured, hatra, a, buffer, state, which, had, recently, shifted, its, loyalty, but, his, forces, were, defeated, at, a, battle, near, resaena, in, 243, carrhae, and, nisibis, were, retaken, by, the, romans, encouraged, by, this, success, the, emperor, gordian, iii, advanced, down, the, euphrates, but, was, defeated, near, ctesiphon, in, the, battle, of, misiche, in, 244, gordian, either,

empire, debilitated, by, germanic, invasions, and, a, series, of, short, term, emperors, shapur, i, soon, resumed, his, attacks, in, the, early, 250s, philip, was, involved, in, a, struggle, over, the, control, of, armenia, shapur, conquered, armenia, and, killed, its, king, defeated, the, romans, at, the, battle, of, barbalissos, in, 253, then, probably, took, and, plundered, antioch, between,

invade, persia, but, they, were, both, murdered, before, they, were, able, to, fulfil, their, plans, in, 283, the, emperor, carus, launched, a, successful, invasion, of, persia, sacking, its, capital, ctesiphon, they, would, probably, have, extended, their, conquests, if, carus, had, not, died, in, december, of, the, same, year, his, successor, numerian, was, forced, by, his, own, army, to, retreat, being, frightened, by, the, belief, that, carus, had, died, of, a, strike, of, lightning, after, a, brief, period, of, peace, during, diocletian, s, early, reign, narseh, renewed, hostilities, with, the, romans, invading, armenia, and, defeated, galerius, not, far, from, carrhae, in, 296, or, 297, however, in, 298, galerius, defeated, narseh, at, the, battle, of, satala, sacked, the, capital, ctesiphon, and, captured, the, persian, treasury, and, royal, harem, the, resulting, peace, settlement, gave, the, romans, control, of, the, area, between, the, tigris, and, the, greater, zab, the, roman, victory, was, the, most, decisive, for, many, decades, all, the, territories, that, had, been, lost, all, the, debatable, lands, and, control, of, armenia, lay, in, roman, hands, many, cities, east, of, the, tigris, were, given, to, the, romans, including, tigranokert, saird, martyropolis, balalesa, moxos, daudia, and, arzan, also, control, of, armenia, was, given, to, the, romans, the, arrangements, of, 299, lasted, until, the, mid, 330s, when, shapur, ii, began, a, series, of, offensives, against, the, romans, despite, a, string, of, victories, in, battle, culminating, in, the, overthrow, of, a, roman, army, led, by, constantius, ii, at, singara, 348, his, campaigns, achieved, little, lasting, effect, three, persian, sieges, of, nisibis, in, that, age, known, as, the, key, to, mesopotamia, were, repulsed, and, while, shapur, succeeded, in, 359, in, successfully, laying, siege, to, amida, and, taking, singara, both, cities, were, soon, regained, by, the, romans, following, a, lull, during, the, 350s, while, shapur, fought, off, nomad, attacks, on, persia, s, eastern, and, then, northern, frontiers, he, launched, a, new, campaign, in, 359, with, the, aid, of, the, eastern, tribes, which, he, had, meanwhile, defeated, and, after, a, difficult, siege, again, captured, amida, 359, in, the, following, year, he, captured, bezabde, and, singara, and, repelled, the, counter, attack, of, constantius, ii, but, the, enormous, cost, of, these, victories, weakened, him, and, he, was, soon, deserted, by, his, barbarian, allies, leaving, him, vulnerable, to, the, major, offensive, in, 363, by, the, roman, emperor, julian, who, advanced, down, the, euphrates, to, ctesiphon, with, a, major, army, despite, a, tactical, victory, at, the, battle, of, ctesiphon, before, the, walls, julian, was, unable, to, take, the, persian, capital, or, advance, any, farther, and, retreated, along, the, tigris, harried, by, the, persians, julian, was, killed, in, the, battle, of, samarra, during, a, difficult, retreat, along, the, tigris, with, the, roman, army, stuck, on, the, eastern, bank, of, the, euphrates, julian, s, successor, jovian, made, peace, agreeing, to, major, concessions, in, exchange, for, safe, passage, out, of, sasanian, territory, the, romans, surrendered, their, former, possessions, east, of, the, tigris, as, well, as, nisibis, and, singara, and, shapur, soon, conquered, armenia, abandoned, by, the, romans, in, 383, or, 384, armenia, again, became, a, bone, of, contention, between, the, roman, and, the, sasanian, empires, but, hostilities, did, not, occur, with, both, empires, preoccupied, by, barbarian, threats, from, the, north, in, 384, or, 387, a, definitive, peace, treaty, was, signed, by, shapur, iii, and, theodosius, i, dividing, armenia, between, the, two, states, meanwhile, the, northern, territories, of, the, roman, empire, were, invaded, by, germanic, alanic, and, hunnic, peoples, while, persia, s, northern, borders, were, threatened, first, by, a, number, of, hunnic, peoples, and, then, by, the, hephthalites, with, both, empires, preoccupied, by, these, threats, a, largely, peaceful, period, followed, interrupted, only, by, two, brief, wars, the, first, in, 421, 422, after, bahram, v, persecuted, high, ranking, persian, officials, who, had, converted, to, christianity, and, the, second, in, 440, when, yazdegerd, ii, raided, roman, armenia, the, anastasian, war, ended, the, longest, period, of, peace, the, two, powers, ever, enjoyed, war, broke, out, when, the, persian, king, kavadh, i, attempted, to, gain, financial, support, by, force, from, the, byzantine, emperor, anastasius, i, the, emperor, refused, to, provide, it, and, the, persian, king, tried, to, take, it, by, force, in, 502, ad, he, quickly, captured, the, unprepared, city, of, theodosiopolis, and, besieged, the, fortress, city, of, amida, through, the, autumn, and, winter, 502, 503, the, siege, of, the, fortress, city, proved, to, be, far, more, difficult, than, kavadh, expected, the, defenders, repelled, the, persian, assaults, for, three, months, before, they, were, beaten, in, 503, the, romans, attempted, an, ultimately, unsuccessful, siege, of, the, persian, held, amida, while, kavadh, invaded, osroene, and, laid, siege, to, edessa, with, the, same, results, finally, in, 504, the, romans, gained, control, through, the, renewed, investment, of, amida, which, led, to, the, fall, of, the, city, that, year, an, armistice, was, reached, as, a, result, of, an, invasion, of, armenia, by, the, huns, from, the, caucasus, although, the, two, powers, negotiated, it, was, not, until, november, 506, that, a, treaty, was, agreed, to, in, 505, anastasius, ordered, the, building, of, a, great, fortified, city, at, dara, at, the, same, time, the, dilapidated, fortifications, were, also, upgraded, at, edessa, batnae, and, amida, although, no, further, large, scale, conflict, took, place, during, anastasius, reign, tensions, continued, especially, while, work, proceeded, at, dara, this, was, because, the, construction, of, new, fortifications, in, the, border, zone, by, either, empire, had, been, prohibited, by, a, treaty, concluded, some, decades, earlier, anastasius, pursued, the, project, despite, persian, objections, and, the, walls, were, completed, by, 507, 508, finally, in, 504, the, romans, gained, the, upper, hand, with, the, renewed, investment, of, amida, leading, to, the, hand, over, of, the, city, that, year, an, armistice, was, agreed, to, as, a, result, of, an, invasion, of, armenia, by, the, huns, from, the, caucasus, negotiations, between, the, two, powers, took, place, but, such, was, their, distrust, that, in, 506, the, romans, suspecting, treachery, seized, the, persian, officials, once, released, the, persians, preferred, to, stay, in, nisibis, in, november, 506, a, treaty, was, finally, agreed, upon, but, little, is, known, of, what, the, terms, of, the, treaty, were, procopius, states, that, peace, was, agreed, for, seven, years, and, it, is, likely, that, some, payments, were, made, to, the, persians, in, 505, anastasius, ordered, the, building, of, a, great, fortified, city, at, dara, the, dilapidated, fortifications, were, also, upgraded, at, edessa, batnac, and, amida, although, no, further, large, scale, conflict, took, place, during, anastasius, reign, tensions, continued, especially, while, work, continued, at, dara, this, construction, project, was, to, become, a, key, component, of, the, roman, defenses, and, also, a, lasting, source, of, controversy, with, the, persians, who, complained, that, it, violated, the, treaty, of, 422, by, which, both, empires, had, agreed, not, to, establish, new, fortifications, in, the, frontier, zone, anastasius, however, pursued, the, project, and, the, walls, were, completed, by, 507, 508, in, 524, 525, ad, kavadh, proposed, that, justin, i, adopt, his, son, khosrau, but, the, negotiations, soon, broke, down, the, proposal, was, initially, greeted, with, enthusiasm, by, the, roman, emperor, and, his, nephew, justinian, but, justin, s, quaestor, proculus, opposed, the, move, tensions, between, the, two, powers, were, further, heightened, by, the, defection, of, the, iberian, king, gourgen, to, the, romans, in, 524, 525, the, iberians, rose, in, revolt, against, persia, following, the, example, of, the, neighboring, christian, kingdom, of, lazica, and, the, romans, recruited, huns, from, the, north, of, the, caucasus, to, assist, them, to, start, with, the, two, sides, preferred, to, wage, war, by, proxy, through, arab, allies, in, the, south, and, huns, in, the, north, overt, roman, persian, fighting, had, broken, out, in, the, transcaucasus, region, and, upper, mesopotamia, by, 526, 527, the, early, years, of, war, favored, the, persians, by, 527, the, iberian, revolt, had, been, crushed, a, roman, offensive, against, nisibis, and, thebetha, in, that, year, was, unsuccessful, and, forces, trying, to, fortify, thannuris, and, melabasa, were, prevented, from, doing, so, by, persian, attacks, attempting, to, remedy, the, deficiencies, revealed, by, these, persian, successes, the, new, roman, emperor, justinian, i, reorganized, the, eastern, armies, in, 528, belisarius, tried, unsuccessfully, to, protect, roman, workers, in, thannuris, undertaking, the, construction, of, a, fort, right, on, the, frontier, damaging, raids, on, syria, by, the, lakhmids, in, 529, encouraged, justinian, to, strengthen, his, own, arab, allies, helping, the, ghassanid, leader, al, harith, ibn, jabalah, turn, a, loose, coalition, into, a, coherent, kingdom, in, 530, a, major, persian, offensive, in, mesopotamia, was, defeated, by, roman, forces, under, belisarius, at, dara, while, a, second, persian, thrust, in, the, caucasus, was, defeated, by, sittas, at, satala, belisarius, was, defeated, by, persian, and, lakhmid, forces, at, the, battle, of, callinicum, in, 531, which, resulted, in, his, dismissal, in, the, same, year, the, romans, gained, some, forts, in, armenia, while, the, persians, had, captured, two,

syria, and, mesopotamia, and, systematically, looting, other, cities, including, antioch, whose, population, was, deported, to, persian, territory, the, successful, campaigns, of, belisarius, in, the, west, encouraged, the, persians, to, return, to, war, both, taking, advantage, of, roman, preoccupation, elsewhere, and, seeking, to, check, the, expansion, of, roman, territory, and, resources, in, 539, the, resumption, of, hostilities, was, foreshadowed, by, a, lakhmid, raid, led, by, al, mundhir, iv, which, was, defeated, by, the, ghassanids, under, al, harith, ibn, jabalah, in, 540, the, persians, broke, the, treaty, of, eternal, peace, and, khosrau, i, invaded, syria, destroying, the, city, of, antioch, and, deporting, its, population, to, weh, antiok, khosrow, in, persia, as, he,

was, quickly, recalled, by, justinian, to, the, east, to, deal, with, the, persian, threat, while, the, ostrogoths, in, italy, who, were, in, touch, with, the, persian, king, launched, a, counter, attack, under, totila, belisarius, took, the, field, and, waged, an, inconclusive, campaign, against, nisibis, in, 541, in, the, same, year, lazica, switched, its, allegiance, to, persia, and, khosrau, led, an, army, to, secure, the, kingdom, in, 542, khosrau, launched, another, offensive, in, mesopotamia, and, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, capture, sergiopolis, he, soon, withdrew, in, the, face, of, an, army, under, belisarius, en, route, sacking, the, city, of, callinicum, attacks, on, a, number, of, roman, cities, were, repulsed, and, the, persian, general, mihr, mihroe, was,

edessenes, paid, five, centenaria, to, khosrau, and, the, persians, departed, after, nearly, two, months, in, the, wake, of, the, persian, retreat, two, roman, envoys, the, newly, appointed, magister, militum, constantinus, and, sergius, proceeded, to, ctesiphon, to, arrange, a, truce, with, khosrau, the, war, dragged, on, under, other, generals, and, was, to, some, extent, hindered, by, the, plague, of, justinian, because, of, which, khosrau, temporarily, withdrew, from, roman, territory, a, five, year, truce, was, agreed, to, in, 545, secured, by, roman, payments, to, the, persians,

549, combined, roman, and, lazic, forces, with, the, magister, militum, of, armenia, dagistheus, won, a, series, of, victories, against, persian, armies, although, they, failed, to, take, the, key,

after, fierce, fighting, demolishing, its, fortifications, in, the, same, year, a, persian, offensive, led, by, mihr, mihroe, occupied, eastern, lazica, the, truce, that, had, been, established, in, 545, was, renewed, outside, lazica, for, a, further, five, years, on, condition, that, the, romans, pay, 2, 000, lb, of, gold, each, year, the, romans, failed, to, completely, expel, the, sasanians, from, lazica, and, in, 554, ad, mihr, mihroe, launched, a, new, attack, dislodging, a, newly, arrived, byzantine, army, from, telephis, in, lazica, the, war, dragged, on, inconclusively, for, several, years, with, neither, side, able, to, make, any, major, gains, khosrau, who, now, had, to, deal, with, the, white, huns, renewed, the, truce, in, 557, this, time, without, excluding, lazica, negotiations, continued, for, a, definite, peace, treaty, finally, in, 562, the, envoys, of, justinian, and, khosrau, peter, the, patrician, and, izedh, gushnap, put, together, the, fifty, year,

involving, roman, and, persian, proxies, in, yemen, between, the, axumites, and, the, himyarites, and, the, syrian, desert, and, after, roman, negotiations, for, an, alliance, with, the, western, turkic, khaganate, against, persia, justin, ii, brought, armenia, under, his, protection, while, roman, troops, under, justin, s, cousin, marcian, raided, arzanene, and, invaded, persian, mesopotamia, where, they, defeated, local, forces, marcian, s, sudden, dismissal, and, the, arrival, of, troops, under, khosrau, resulted, in, a, ravaging, of, syria, the, failure, of, the, roman, siege, of, nisibis, and, the, fall, of, dara, at, a, cost, of, 45, 000, solidi, a, one, year, truce, in, mesopotamia, eventually, extended, to, five, years, was, arranged, but, in, the, caucasus, and, on, the,

but, to, take, theodosiopolis, and, after, a, clash, near, melitene, the, army, suffered, heavy, losses, while, fleeing, across, the, euphrates, under, roman, attack, and, the, persian, royal, baggage, was, captured, the, romans, exploited, persian, disarray, as, general, justinian, invaded, deep, into, persian, territory, and, raided, atropatene, khosrau, sought, peace, but, abandoned, this, initiative, when, persian, confidence, revived, after, tamkhusro, won, a, victory, in, armenia, where, roman, actions, had, alienated, local, inhabitants, in, the, spring, of, 578, the, war, in, mesopotamia, resumed, with, persian, raids, on, roman, territory, the, roman, general, maurice, retaliated, by, raiding, persian, mesopotamia, capturing, the, stronghold, of, aphumon, and, sacking, singara, khosrau, again, opened, peace, negotiations, but, he, died, early, in, 579, and, his, successor, hormizd, iv, r, 578, 590, preferred, to, continue, the, war, in, 580, hormizd, iv, abolished, the, caucasian, iberian, monarchy, and, turned, iberia, into, a, persian, province, ruled, by, a, marzpan, governor, during, the, 580s, the, war, continued, inconclusively, with, victories, on, both, sides, in, 582, maurice, won, a, battle, at, constantia, over, adarmahan, and, tamkhusro, who, was, killed, but, the, roman, general, did, not, follow, up, his, victory, he, had, to, hurry, to, constantinople, to, pursue, his, imperial, ambitions, another, roman, victory, at, solachon, in, 586, likewise, failed, to, break, the, stalemate, the, persians, captured, martyropolis, through, treachery, in, 589, but, that, year, the, stalemate, was, shattered, when, the, persian, general, bahram, chobin, having, been, dismissed, and, humiliated, by, hormizd, iv, raised, a, rebellion, hormizd, was, overthrown, in, a, palace, coup, in, 590, and, replaced, by, his, son, khosrau, ii, but, bahram, pressed, on, with, his, revolt, regardless, and, the, defeated, khosrau, was, soon, forced, to, flee, for, safety, to, roman, territory, while, bahram, took, the, throne, as, bahram, vi, with, support, from, maurice, khosrau, raised, a, rebellion, against, bahram, and, in, 591, the, combined, forces, of, his, supporters, and, the, romans, defeated, bahram, at, the, battle, of, blarathon, and, restored, khosrau, ii, to, power, in, exchange, for, their, help, khosrau, not, only, returned, dara, and, martyropolis, but, also, agreed, to, cede, the, western, half, of, iberia, and, more, than, half, of, persian, armenia, to, the, romans, in, 602, the, roman, army, campaigning, in, the, balkans, mutinied, under, the, leadership, of, phocas, who, succeeded, in, seizing, the, throne, and, then, killed, maurice, and, his, family, khosrau, ii, used, the, murder, of, his, benefactor, as, a, pretext, for, war, and, reconquer, the, roman, province, of, mesopotamia, in, the, early, years, of, the, war, the, persians, enjoyed, overwhelming, and, unprecedented, success, they, were, aided, by, khosrau, s, use, of, a, pretender, claiming, to, be, maurice, s, son, and, by, the, revolt, against, phocas, led, by, the, roman, general, narses, in, 603, khosrau, defeated, and, killed, the, roman, general, germanus, in, mesopotamia, and, laid, siege, to, dara, despite, the, arrival, of, roman, reinforcements, from, europe, he, won, another, victory, in, 604, while, dara, fell, after, a, nine, month, siege, over, the, following, years, the, persians, gradually, overcame, the, fortress, cities, of, mesopotamia, by, siege, one, after, another, at, the, same, time, they, won, a, string, of, victories, in, armenia, and, systematically, subdued, the, roman, garrisons, in, the, caucasus, phocas, brutal, repression, sparked, a, succession, crisis, that, ensued, as, the, general, heraclius, sent, his, nephew, nicetas, to, attack, egypt, enabling, his, younger, son, heraclius, to, claim, the, throne, in, 610, phocas, an, unpopular, ruler, who, is, invariably, described, in, byzantine, sources, as, a, tyrant, was, eventually, deposed, by, heraclius, having, sailed, from, carthage, around, the, same, time, the, persians, completed, their, conquest, of, mesopotamia, and, the, caucasus, and, in, 611, they, overran, syria, and, entered, anatolia, occupying, caesarea, having, expelled, the, persians, from, anatolia, in, 612, heraclius, launched, a, major, counter, offensive, in, syria, in, 613, he, was, decisively, defeated, outside, antioch, by, shahrbaraz, and, shahin, and, the, roman, position, collapsed, over, the, following, decade, the, persians, were, able, to, conquer, palestine, egypt, rhodes, and, several, other, islands, in, the, eastern, aegean, as, well, as, to, devastate, anatolia, meanwhile, the, avars, and, slavs, took, advantage, of, the, situation, to, overrun, the, balkans, bringing, the, roman, empire, to, the, brink, of, destruction, during, these, years, heraclius, strove, to, rebuild, his, army, slashing, non, military, expenditures, devaluing, the, currency, and, melting, down, church, plate, with, the, backing, of, patriarch, sergius, to, raise, the, necessary, funds, to, continue, the, war, in, 622, heraclius, left, constantinople, entrusting, the, city, to, sergius, and, general, bonus, as, regents, of, his, son, he, assembled, his, forces, in, asia, minor, and, after, conducting, exercises, to, revive, their, morale, he, launched, a, new, counter, offensive, which, took, on, the, character, of, a, holy, war, in, the, caucasus, he, inflicted, a, defeat, on, an, army, led, by, a, persian, allied, arab, chief, and, then, won, a, victory, over, the, persians, under, shahrbaraz, following, a, lull, in, 623, while, he, negotiated, a, truce, with, the, avars, heraclius, resumed, his, campaigns, in, the, east, in, 624, and, routed, an, army, led, by, khosrau, at, ganzak, in, atropatene, in, 625, he, defeated, the, generals, shahrbaraz, shahin, and, shahraplakan, in, armenia, and, in, a, surprise, attack, that, winter, he, stormed, shahrbaraz, s, headquarters, and, attacked, his, troops, in, their, winter, billets, supported, by, a, persian, army, commanded, by, shahrbaraz, together, with, the, avars, and, slavs, the, three, unsuccessfully, besieged, constantinople, in, 626, while, a, second, persian, army, under, shahin, suffered, another, crushing, defeat, at, the, hands, of, heraclius, brother, theodore, meanwhile, heraclius, formed, an, alliance, with, the, western, turkic, khaganate, who, took, advantage, of, the, dwindling, strength, of, the, persians, to, ravage, their, territories, in, the, caucasus, late, in, 627, heraclius, launched, a, winter, offensive, into, mesopotamia, where, despite, the, desertion, of, the, turkish, contingent, that, had, accompanied, him, he, defeated, the, persians, at, the, battle, of, nineveh, continuing, south, along, the, tigris, he, sacked, khosrau, s, great, palace, at, dastagird, and, was, prevented, from, attacking, ctesiphon, only, by, the, destruction, of, the, bridges, on, the, nahrawan, canal, khosrau, was, overthrown, and, killed, in, a, coup, led, by, his, son, kavadh, ii, who, at, once, sued, for, peace, agreeing, to, withdraw, from, all, occupied, territories, heraclius, restored, the, true, cross, to, jerusalem, with, a, majestic, ceremony, in, 629, the, devastating, impact, of, this, last, war, added, to, the, cumulative, effects, of, a, century, of, almost, continuous, conflict, left, both, empires, crippled, when, kavadh, ii, died, only, months, after, coming, to, the, throne, persia, was, plunged, into, several, years, of, dynastic, turmoil, and, civil, war, the, sasanians, were, further, weakened, by, economic, decline, heavy, taxation, from, khosrau, ii, s, campaigns, religious, unrest, and, the, increasing, power, of, the, provincial, landholders, the, byzantine, empire, was, also, severely, affected, with, its, financial, reserves, exhausted, by, the, war, and, the, balkans, now, largely, in, the, hands, of, the, slavs, additionally, anatolia, was, devastated, by, repeated, persian, invasions, the, empire, s, hold, on, its, recently, regained, territories, in, the, caucasus, syria, mesopotamia, palestine, and, egypt, was, loosened, by, many, years, of, persian, occupation, neither, empire, was, given, any, chance, to, recover, as, within, a, few, years, they, were, struck, by, the, onslaught, of, the, arabs, newly, united, by, islam, which, according, to, howard, johnston, can, only, be, likened, to, a, human, tsunami, according, to, george, liska, the, unnecessarily, prolonged, byzantine, persian, conflict, opened, the, way, for, islam, the, sasanian, empire, rapidly, succumbed, to, these, attacks, and, was, completely, conquered, during, the, byzantine, arab, wars, the, exhausted, roman, empire, s, recently, regained, eastern, and, southern, provinces, of, syria, armenia, egypt, and, north, africa, were, also, lost, reducing, the, empire, to, a, territorial, rump, consisting, of, anatolia, and, a, scatter, of, islands, and, footholds, in, the, balkans, and, italy, these, remaining, lands, were, thoroughly, impoverished, by, frequent, attacks, marking, the, transition, from, classical, urban, civilization, to, a, more, rural, medieval, form, of, society, however, unlike, persia, the, roman, empire, ultimately, survived, the, arab, assault, holding, onto, its, residual, territories, and, decisively, repulsing, two, arab, sieges, of, its, capital, in, 674, 678, and, 717, 718, the, roman, empire, also, lost, its, territories, in, crete, and, southern, italy, to, the, arabs, in, later, conflicts, though, these, too, were, ultimately, recovered, when, the, roman, and, parthian, empires, first, collided, in, the, 1st, century, bc, it, appeared, that, parthia, had, the, potential, to, push, its, frontier, to, the, aegean, and, the, mediterranean, however, the, romans, repulsed, the, great, invasion, of, syria, and, anatolia, by, pacorus, and, labienus, and, were, gradually, able, to, take, advantage, of, the, weaknesses, of, the, parthian, military, system, which, according, to, george, rawlinson, was, adapted, for, national, defense, but, ill, suited, for, conquest, the, romans, on, the, other, hand, were, continually, modifying, and, evolving, their, grand, strategy, from, trajan, s, time, onwards, and, were, by, the, time, of, pacorus, able, to, take, the, offensive, against, the, parthians, like, the, sasanians, in, the, late, 3rd, and, 4th, centuries, the, parthians, generally, avoided, any, sustained, defense, of, mesopotamia, against, the, romans, however, the, iranian, plateau, never, fell, as, the, roman, expeditions, had, always, exhausted, their, offensive, impetus, by, the, time, they, reached, lower, mesopotamia, and, their, extended, line, of, communications, through, territory, not, sufficiently, pacified, exposed, them, to, revolts, and, counterattacks, from, the, 4th, century, ad, onwards, the, sasanians, grew, in, strength, and, adopted, the, role, of, aggressor, they, considered, much, of, the, land, added, to, the, roman, empire, in, parthian, and, early, sasanian, times, to, rightfully, belong, to, the, persian, sphere, everett, wheeler, argues, that, the, sassanids, administratively, more, centralized, than, the, parthians, formally, organized, defense, of, their, territory, although, they, lacked, a, standing, army, until, khosrau, i, in, general, the, romans, regarded, the, sasanians, as, a, more, serious, threat, than, the, parthians, while, the, sasanians, regarded, the, roman, empire, as, the, enemy, par, excellence, proxy, warfare, was, employed, by, both, byzantines, and, the, sasanians, as, an, alternative, to, direct, confrontation, particularly, through, arab, kingdoms, in, the, south, and, nomadic, nations, in, the, north, militarily, the, sasanians, continued, the, parthians, heavy, dependence, on, cavalry, troops, a, combination, of, horse, archers, and, cataphracts, the, latter, were, heavy, armored, cavalry, provided, by, the, aristocracy, they, added, a, contingent, of, war, elephants, obtained, from, the, indus, valley, but, their, infantry, quality, was, inferior, to, that, of, the, romans, the, combined, forces, of, horse, archers, and, heavy, cavalry, inflicted, several, defeats, on, the, roman, foot, soldiers, including, those, led, by, crassus, in, 53, bc, mark, antony, in, 36, bc, and, valerian, in, 260, ad, the, parthian, tactics, gradually, became, the, standard, method, of, warfare, in, the, roman, empire, and, cataphractarii, and, clibanarii, units, were, introduced, into, the, roman, army, as, a, result, heavily, armed, cavalry, grew, in, importance, in, both, the, roman, and, persian, armies, after, the, 3rd, century, ad, and, until, the, end, of, the, wars, the, roman, army, also, gradually, incorporated, horse, archers, equites, sagittarii, and, by, the, 5th, century, ad, they, were, no, longer, a, mercenary, unit, and, were, slightly, superior, individually, in, comparison, to, the, persian, ones, as, procopius, claims, however, the, persian, horse, archer, units, as, a, whole, always, remained, a, challenge, for, the, romans, which, suggests, the, roman, horse, archers, were, smaller, in, numbers, by, the, time, of, khosrow, i, the, composite, cavalrymen, aswaran, appeared, who, were, skilled, in, both, archery, and, the, use, of, lance, on, the, other, hand, the, persians, adopted, war, engines, from, the, romans, the, romans, had, achieved, and, maintained, a, high, degree, of, sophistication, in, siege, warfare, and, had, developed, a, range, of, siege, machines, on, the, other, hand, the, parthians, were, inept, at, besieging, their, cavalry, armies, were, more, suited, to, the, hit, and, run, tactics, that, destroyed, antony, s, siege, train, in, 36, bc, the, situation, changed, with, the, rise, of, the, sasanians, when, rome, encountered, an, enemy, equally, capable, in, siege, warfare, the, sasanians, mainly, used, mounds, rams, mines, and, to, a, lesser, degree, siege, towers, artillery, and, also, chemical, weapons, such, as, in, dura, europos, 256, and, petra, 550, 551, use, of, complex, torsion, equipment, was, rare, since, traditional, persian, expertise, in, archery, reduced, their, apparent, benefits, elephants, were, employed, e, g, as, siege, towers, where, the, terrain, was, unfavorable, for, machines, recent, assessments, comparing, the, sasanians, and, parthians, have, reaffirmed, the, superiority, of, sasanian, siegecraft, military, engineering, and, organization, as, well, as, ability, to, build, defensive, works, by, the, beginning, of, sasanian, rule, a, number, of, buffer, states, existed, between, the, empires, these, were, absorbed, by, the, central, state, over, time, and, by, the, 7th, century, the, last, buffer, state, the, arab, lakhmids, was, annexed, to, the, sasanian, empire, frye, notes, that, in, the, 3rd, century, ad, such, client, states, played, an, important, role, in, roman, sasanian, relations, but, both, empires, gradually, replaced, them, by, an, organized, defense, system, run, by, the, central, government, and, based, on, a, line, of, fortifications, the, limes, and, the, fortified, frontier, cities, such, as, dara, towards, the, end, of, the, 1st, century, ad, rome, organized, the, protection, of, its, eastern, frontiers, through, the, limes, system, which, lasted, until, the, muslim, conquests, of, the, 7th, century, after, improvements, by, diocletian, like, the, romans, the, sasanians, constructed, defensive, walls, opposite, the, territory, of, their, opponents, according, to, r, n, frye, it, was, under, shapur, ii, that, the, persian, system, was, extended, probably, in, imitation, of, diocletian, s, construction, of, the, limes, of, the, syrian, and, mesopotamian, frontiers, of, the, roman, empire, the, roman,

a, tool, of, policy, not, just, the, prisoners, of, war, such, as, those, of, the, battle, of, edessa, but, also, the, cities, they, captured, such, as, the, deportation, of, the, antioch, s, people, to, weh, antiok, khosrow, which, led, to, the, decline, of, the, former, these, deportations, also, initiated, the, spread, of, christianity, in, persia, the, persians, seem, to, have, been,

confrontations, and, observed, that, it, is, shown, by, the, facts, themselves, that, conquest, has, been, a, source, of, constant, wars, and, great, expense, to, us, for, it, yields, very, little, and, uses, up, vast, sums, and, now, that, we, have, reached, out, to, peoples, who, are, neighbor, of, the, medes, and, the, parthians, rather, than, of, ourselves, we, are, always, one, might, say, fighting, the, battles, of, those, peoples, in, the, long, series, of, wars, between, the, two, powers, the, frontier, in, upper, mesopotamia, remained, more, or, less, constant, historians, point, out, that, the, stability, of, the, frontier, over, the, centuries, is, remarkable, although, nisibis, singara, dara, and, other, cities, of, upper, mesopotamia, changed, hands, from, time, to, time,

between, persia, and, east, rome, revolved, around, issues, of, strategic, control, around, the, eastern, frontier, yet, there, was, always, a, religious, ideological, element, present, from, the, time, of, constantine, on, roman, emperors, appointed, themselves, as, the, protectors, of, christians, of, persia, this, attitude, created, intense, suspicions, of, the, loyalties, of, christians,

persia, the, sources, for, the, history, of, parthia, and, the, wars, with, rome, are, scant, and, scattered, the, parthians, followed, the, achaemenid, tradition, and, favored, oral, historiography, which, assured, the, corruption, of, their, history, once, they, had, been, vanquished, the, main, sources, of, this, period, are, thus, roman, tacitus, marius, maximus, and, justin, and, greek, historians, herodian, cassius, dio, and, plutarch, the, 13th, book, of, the, sibylline, oracles, narrates, the, effects, of, the, roman, persian, wars, in, syria, from, the, reign, of, gordian, iii,

narratives, of, lactantius, and, eusebius, at, the, beginning, of, the, 4th, century, both, from, a, christian, perspective, the, principal, sources, for, the, early, sasanian, period, are, not, contemporary, among, them, the, most, important, are, the, greeks, agathias, and, malalas, the, persian, muslims, al, tabari, and, ferdowsi, the, armenian, agathangelos, and, the, syriac, chronicles, of, edessa, and, arbela, most, of, whom, depended, on, late, sasanian, sources, especially, khwaday, namag, the, augustan, history, is, neither, contemporary, nor, reliable, but, it, is, the, chief,

for, the, period, between, 353, and, 378, there, is, an, eyewitness, source, to, the, main, events, on, the, eastern, frontier, in, the, res, gestae, of, ammianus, marcellinus, for, the, events, covering, the, period, between, the, 4th, and, the, 6th, century, the, works, of, sozomenus, zosimus, priscus, and, zonaras, are, especially, valuable, the, single, most, important, source, for,
