19, 000, troops, 37, ships, 222, 212, total, troops, the, first, opium, war, chinese, pinyin, d, y, c, y, pi, n, zh, nzh, ng, also, known, as, the, anglo, chinese, war, was, a, series, of, military, engagements, fought, between, the, british, empire, and, the, qing, dynasty, of, china, between, 1839, and, 1842, the, immediate, issue, was, the, chinese, enforcement, of, their, ban, on, the, opium, trade, by, seizing, private, opium, stocks, from, mainly, british, merchants, at, guangzhou, then, named, canton, and, threatening, to, impose, the, death, penalty, for, future, offenders, despite, the, opium, ban, the, british, government, supported, the, merchants, demand, for, compensation, for, seized, goods, and, insisted, on, the, principles, of, free, trade, and, equal, diplomatic, recognition, with, china, opium, was, britain, s, single, most, profitable, commodity, trade, of, the, 19th, century, after, months, of, tensions, between, the, two, states, the, royal, navy, launched, an, expedition, in, june, 1840, which, ultimately, defeated, the, chinese, using, technologically, superior, ships, and, weapons, by, august, 1842, the, british, then, imposed, the, treaty, of, nanking, which, forced, china, to, increase, foreign, trade, give, compensation, and, cede, hong, kong, island, to, the, british, consequently, the, opium, trade, continued, in, china, twentieth, century, nationalists, considered, 1839, the, start, of, a, century, of, humiliation, and, many, historians, consider, it, the, beginning, of, modern, chinese, history, in, the, 18th, century, the, european, demand, for, chinese, luxury, goods, particularly, silk, porcelain, and, tea, created, a, trade, imbalance, between, china, and, britain, european, silver, flowed, into, china, through, the, canton, system, which, confined, incoming, foreign, trade, to, the, southern, port, city, of, guangzhou, to, counter, this, imbalance, the, british, east, india, company, began, to, grow, opium, in, bengal, and, allowed, private, british, merchants, to, sell, opium, to, chinese, smugglers, for, illegal, sale, in, china, the, influx, of, narcotics, reversed, the, chinese, trade, surplus, drained, the, economy, of, silver, and, increased, the, numbers, of, opium, addicts, inside, the, country, outcomes, that, seriously, worried, chinese, officials, senior, government, officials, within, the, country, had, been, shown, to, be, colluding, against, the, imperial, ban, due, to, stocks, of, opium, in, european, warehouses, in, clear, view, being, ignored, in, 1839, the, daoguang, emperor, rejecting, proposals, to, legalise, and, tax, opium, appointed, viceroy, of, huguang, lin, zexu, to, go, to, guangzhou, to, halt, the, opium, trade, completely, lin, wrote, an, open, letter, to, queen, victoria, appealing, to, her, moral, responsibility, to, stop, the, opium, trade, although, she, never, received, it, lin, then, resorted, to, using, force, in, the, western, merchants, enclave, he, arrived, in, guangzhou, at, the, end, of, january, 1839, and, organized, a, coastal, defence, in, march, 1839, british, opium, dealers, were, forced, to, hand, over, 2, 37, million, pounds, of, opium, on, 3, june, 1839, lin, ordered, the, opium, to, be, destroyed, in, public, on, humen, beach, to, show, the, government, s, determination, to, ban, smoking, all, other, supplies, were, confiscated, and, a, blockade, of, foreign, ships, on, the, pearl, river, was, ordered, tensions, escalated, in, july, 1839, after, drunk, british, sailors, killed, a, chinese, villager, named, lin, weixi, the, british, official, in, charge, admiral, charles, elliot, refused, to, hand, over, those, accused, to, chinese, authorities, in, an, attempt, to, avoid, their, being, killed, on, the, spot, as, had, happened, with, british, citizens, in, the, lady, hughes, affair, of, 1784, later, fighting, broke, out, with, the, british, navy, destroying, the, chinese, naval, blockade, and, launching, an, offensive, in, the, ensuing, conflict, the, royal, navy, used, its, superior, naval, and, gunnery, power, to, inflict, a, series, of, decisive, defeats, on, the, chinese, empire, in, 1842, the, qing, dynasty, was, forced, to, sign, the, treaty, of, nanking, the, first, of, what, the, chinese, later, called, the, unequal, treaties, which, granted, an, indemnity, and, extraterritoriality, to, british, subjects, in, china, opened, five, treaty, ports, to, british, merchants, and, ceded, hong, kong, island, to, the, british, empire, the, failure, of, the, treaty, to, satisfy, british, goals, of, improved, trade, and, diplomatic, relations, led, to, the, second, opium, war, 1856, 1860, the, resulting, social, unrest, was, the, background, for, the, taiping, rebellion, which, further, weakened, the, qing, regime, direct, maritime, trade, between, europe, and, china, began, in, 1557, when, the, portuguese, empire, leased, an, outpost, from, the, ming, dynasty, in, macau, other, european, nations, soon, followed, the, portuguese, lead, inserting, themselves, into, the, existing, asian, maritime, trade, network, to, compete, with, arab, chinese, indian, and, japanese, merchants, in, intraregional, commerce, after, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, philippines, the, exchange, of, goods, between, china, and, europe, accelerated, dramatically, from, 1565, the, manila, galleons, brought, silver, into, the, asian, trade, network, from, mines, in, south, america, china, was, a, primary, destination, for, the, precious, metal, as, the, imperial, government, mandated, that, chinese, goods, could, only, be, exported, in, exchange, for, silver, bullion, british, ships, began, to, appear, sporadically, around, the, coasts, of, china, from, 1635, on, without, establishing, formal, relations, through, the, chinese, tributary, system, by, which, most, asian, nations, were, able, to, negotiate, with, china, british, merchants, were, only, allowed, to, trade, at, the, ports, of, zhoushan, xiamen, or, amoy, and, guangzhou, official, british, trade, was, conducted, through, the, auspices, of, the, british, east, india, company, which, held, a, royal, charter, for, trade, with, the, far, east, the, east, india, company, gradually, came, to, dominate, sino, european, trade, from, its, position, in, india, and, due, to, the, strength, of, the, royal, navy, trade, benefited, after, the, newly, risen, qing, dynasty, relaxed, maritime, trade, restrictions, in, the, 1680s, formosa, taiwan, came, under, qing, control, in, 1683, and, rhetoric, regarding, the, tributary, status, of, europeans, was, muted, guangzhou, became, the, port, of, preference, for, incoming, foreign, trade, ships, did, try, to, call, at, other, ports, but, these, locations, could, not, match, the, benefits, of, guangzhou, s, geographic, position, at, the, mouth, of, the, pearl, river, nor, did, they, have, the, city, s, long, experience, in, balancing, the, demands, of, beijing, with, those, of, chinese, and, foreign, merchants, from, 1700, onward, guangzhou, was, the, centre, of, maritime, trade, with, china, and, this, market, process, was, gradually, formulated, by, qing, authorities, into, the, canton, system, from, the, system, s, inception, in, 1757, trading, in, china, was, extremely, lucrative, for, european, and, chinese, merchants, alike, as, goods, such, as, tea, porcelain, and, silk, were, valued, highly, enough, in, europe, to, justify, the, expenses, of, travelling, to, asia, the, system, was, highly, regulated, by, the, qing, government, foreign, traders, were, only, permitted, to, do, business, through, a, body, of, chinese, merchants, known, as, the, cohong, and, were, forbidden, to, learn, chinese, foreigners, could, only, live, in, one, of, the, thirteen, factories, and, were, not, allowed, to, enter, or, trade, in, any, other, part, of, china, only, low, level, government, officials, could, be, dealt, with, and, the, imperial, court, could, not, be, lobbied, for, any, reason, excepting, official, diplomatic, missions, the, imperial, laws, that, upheld, the, system, were, collectively, known, as, the, prevention, barbarian, ordinances, the, cohong, were, particularly, powerful, in, the, old, china, trade, as, they, were, tasked, with, appraising, the, value, of, foreign, products, purchasing, or, rebuffing, said, imports, and, charged, with, selling, chinese, exports, at, an, appropriate, price, the, cohong, was, made, up, of, between, depending, on, the, politics, of, guangzhou, 6, to, 20, merchant, families, most, of, the, merchant, houses, these, families, ruled, had, been, established, by, low, ranking, mandarins, but, several, were, cantonese, or, han, in, origin, another, key, function, of, the, cohong, was, the, traditional, bond, signed, between, a, cohong, member, and, a, foreign, merchant, this, bond, stated, that, the, receiving, cohong, member, was, responsible, for, the, foreign, merchant, s, behavior, and, cargo, while, in, china, in, addition, to, dealing, with, the, cohong, european, merchants, were, required, to, pay, customs, fees, measurement, duties, provide, gifts, and, hire, navigators, despite, restrictions, silk, and, porcelain, continued, to, drive, trade, through, their, popularity, in, europe, and, an, insatiable, demand, for, chinese, tea, existed, in, britain, from, the, mid, 17th, century, onward, around, 28, million, kilograms, 61, 6, million, pounds, of, silver, were, received, by, china, principally, from, european, powers, in, exchange, for, chinese, products, a, brisk, trade, between, china, and, european, powers, continued, for, over, a, century, while, this, trading, heavily, favoured, the, chinese, and, resulted, in, european, nations, sustaining, large, trade, deficits, the, demand, for, chinese, goods, continued, to, drive, commerce, in, addition, the, colonisation, and, conquest, of, the, americas, resulted, in, european, nations, namely, spain, great, britain, and, france, gaining, access, to, a, cheap, supply, of, silver, resulting, in, european, economies, remaining, relatively, stable, despite, the, trade, deficit, with, china, this, silver, was, also, shipped, across, the, pacific, ocean, to, china, directly, notably, through, the, spanish, controlled, philippines, in, stark, contrast, to, the, european, situation, qing, china, sustained, a, trade, surplus, foreign, silver, flooded, into, china, in, exchange, for, chinese, goods, expanding, the, chinese, economy, but, also, causing, inflation, and, forming, a, chinese, reliance, on, european, silver, the, continued, economic, expansion, of, european, economies, in, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, gradually, increased, the, european, demand, for, precious, metals, which, were, used, to, mint, new, coins, this, increasing, need, for, hard, currency, to, remain, in, circulation, in, europe, reduced, the, supply, of, bullion, available, for, trade, in, china, driving, up, costs, and, leading, to, competition, between, merchants, in, europe, and, european, merchants, who, traded, with, the, chinese, this, market, force, resulted, in, a, chronic, trade, deficit, for, european, governments, who, were, forced, to, risk, silver, shortages, in, their, domestic, economies, to, supply, the, needs, of, their, merchants, in, asia, who, as, private, enterprises, still, turned, a, profit, by, selling, valuable, chinese, goods, to, consumers, in, europe, this, gradual, effect, was, greatly, exacerbated, by, a, series, of, large, scale, colonial, wars, between, great, britain, and, spain, in, the, mid, 18th, century, these, conflicts, disrupted, the, international, silver, market, and, eventually, resulted, in, the, independence, of, powerful, new, nations, namely, the, united, states, and, mexico, without, cheap, silver, from, the, colonies, to, sustain, their, trade, european, merchants, who, traded, with, china, began, to, take, silver, directly, out, of, circulation, in, the, already, weakened, economies, of, europe, to, pay, for, goods, in, china, this, angered, governments, who, saw, their, economies, shrink, as, a, result, and, fostered, a, great, deal, of, animosity, towards, the, chinese, for, their, restriction, of, european, trade, the, chinese, economy, was, unaffected, by, fluctuations, in, silver, prices, as, china, was, able, to, import, japanese, silver, to, stabilise, its, money, supply, european, goods, remained, in, low, demand, in, china, ensuring, the, longstanding, trade, surplus, with, the, european, nations, continued, despite, these, tensions, trade, between, china, and, europe, grew, by, an, estimated, 4, annually, in, the, years, leading, up, to, the, start, of, the, opium, trade, opium, as, a, medicinal, ingredient, was, documented, in, chinese, texts, as, early, as, the, tang, dynasty, 617, 907, but, the, recreational, usage, of, the, narcotic, was, limited, as, with, india, opium, then, limited, by, distance, to, a, dried, powder, often, drunk, with, tea, or, water, was, introduced, to, china, and, southeast, asia, by, arab, merchants, the, ming, dynasty, banned, tobacco, as, a, decadent, good, in, 1640, and, opium, was, seen, as, a, similarly, minor, issue, the, first, restrictions, on, opium, were, passed, by, the, qing, in, 1729, when, madak, a, substance, made, from, powdered, opium, blended, with, tobacco, was, banned, at, the, time, madak, production, used, up, most, of, the, opium, being, imported, into, china, as, pure, opium, was, difficult, to, preserve, consumption, of, javanese, opium, rose, in, the, 18th, century, and, after, the, napoleonic, wars, resulted, in, the, british, occupying, java, british, merchants, became, the, primary, traders, in, opium, the, british, realised, they, could, reduce, their, trade, deficit, with, chinese, manufactories, by, counter, trading, in, narcotic, opium, and, therefore, efforts, were, made, to, produce, more, opium, in, company, controlled, india, limited, british, sales, of, indian, opium, began, in, 1781, with, exports, to, china, increasing, as, the, east, india, company, solidified, its, control, over, india, the, british, opium, was, produced, in, bengal, and, the, ganges, river, plain, where, the, british, inherited, an, existing, opium, industry, from, the, declining, mughal, empire, and, saw, the, product, as, a, potentially, valuable, export, the, east, india, company, commissioned, and, managed, hundreds, of, thousands, of, poppy, plantations, it, took, care, of, the, painstaking, lancing, of, individual, pods, to, obtain, the, raw, gum, drying, and, forming, it, into, cakes, before, coating, and, packaging, them, for, auction, in, calcutta, the, company, tightly, controlled, the, opium, industry, and, all, opium, was, considered, company, property, until, it, was, sold, from, kolkata, the, company, s, board, of, customs, salt, and, opium, concerned, itself, with, quality, control, by, managing, the, way, opium, was, packaged, and, shipped, no, poppies, could, be, cultivated, without, the, company, s, permission, and, the, company, banned, private, businesses, from, refining, opium, all, opium, in, india, was, sold, to, the, company, at, a, fixed, rate, and, the, company, hosted, a, series, of, public, opium, auctions, every, year, the, difference, of, the, company, set, price, of, raw, opium, and, the, sale, price, of, refined, opium, at, auction, minus, expenses, was, profit, made, by, the, east, india, company, in, addition, to, securing, poppies, cultivated, on, lands, under, its, direct, control, the, company, s, board, issued, licences, to, the, independent, princely, states, of, malwa, where, significant, quantities, of, poppies, were, grown, by, the, late, 18th, century, company, and, malwan, farmlands, which, were, traditionally, dependent, on, cotton, growing, had, been, hard, hit, by, the, introduction, of, factory, produced, cotton, cloth, which, used, cotton, grown, in, egypt, or, the, american, south, opium, was, considered, a, lucrative, replacement, and, was, soon, being, auctioned, in, ever, larger, amounts, in, calcutta, private, merchants, who, possessed, a, company, charter, to, comply, with, the, british, royal, charter, for, asiatic, trade, bid, on, and, acquired, goods, at, the, calcutta, auction, before, sailing, to, southern, china, british, ships, brought, their, cargoes, to, islands, off, the, coast, especially, lintin, island, where, chinese, traders, with, fast, and, well, armed, small, boats, took, the, goods, inland, for, distribution, paying, for, the, opium, with, silver, the, qing, administration, initially, tolerated, opium, importation, because, it, created, an, indirect, tax, on, chinese, subjects, as, increasing, the, silver, supply, available, to, foreign, merchants, through, the, sale, of, opium, encouraged, europeans, to, spend, more, money, on, chinese, goods, this, policy, provided, the, funds, british, merchants, needed, to, then, greatly, increase, tea, exports, from, china, to, england, delivering, further, profits, to, the, qing, monopoly, on, tea, exports, held, by, the, imperial, treasury, and, its, agents, in, guangzhou, however, opium, usage, continued, to, grow, in, china, adversely, affecting, societal, stability, from, guangzhou, the, habit, spread, outwards, to, the, north, and, west, affecting, members, from, every, class, of, chinese, society, by, the, early, 19th, century, more, and, more, chinese, were, smoking, british, opium, as, a, recreational, drug, but, for, many, what, started, as, recreation, soon, became, a, punishing, addiction, many, people, who, stopped, ingesting, opium, suffered, chills, nausea, and, cramps, and, sometimes, died, from, withdrawal, once, addicted, people, would, often, do, almost, anything, to, continue, to, get, access, to, the, drug, these, serious, social, issues, eventually, led, to, the, qing, government, issuing, an, edict, against, the, drug, in, 1780, followed, by, an, outright, ban, in, 1796, and, an, order, from, the, governor, of, guangzhou, to, stop, the, trade, in, 1799, to, circumnavigate, the, increasingly, stringent, regulations, in, guangzhou, foreign, merchants, bought, older, ships, and, converted, them, into, floating, warehouses, these, ships, were, anchored, off, of, the, chinese, coast, at, the, mouth, of, the, pearl, river, in, case, the, chinese, authorities, moved, against, the, opium, trade, as, the, ships, of, the, chinese, navy, had, difficulty, operating, in, open, water, inbound, opium, ships, would, unload, a, portion, of, their, cargo, onto, these, floating, warehouses, where, the, narcotic, was, eventually, purchased, by, chinese, opium, dealers, by, implementing, this, system, of, smuggling, foreign, merchants, could, avoid, inspection, by, chinese, officials, and, prevent, retaliation, against, the, trade, in, legal, goods, in, which, many, smugglers, also, participated, in, the, early, 19th, century, american, merchants, joined, the, trade, and, began, to, introduce, opium, from, turkey, into, the, chinese, market, this, supply, was, of, lesser, quality, but, cheaper, and, the, resulting, competition, among, british, and, american, merchants, drove, down, the, price, of, opium, leading, to, an, increase, in, the, availability, of, the, drug, for, chinese, consumers, the, demand, for, opium, rose, rapidly, and, was, so, profitable, in, china, that, chinese, opium, dealers, who, unlike, european, merchants, could, legally, travel, to, and, sell, goods, in, the, chinese, interior, began, to, seek, out, more, suppliers, of, the, drug, the, resulting, shortage, in, supply, drew, more, european, merchants, into, the, increasingly, lucrative, opium, trade, to, meet, the, chinese, demand, in, the, words, of, one, trading, house, agent, it, is, like, gold, i, can, sell, it, anytime, from, 1804, to, 1820, a, period, when, the, qing, treasury, needed, to, finance, the, suppression, of, the, white, lotus, rebellion, and, other, conflicts, the, flow, of, money, gradually, reversed, and, chinese, merchants, were, soon, exporting, silver, to, pay, for, opium, rather, than, europeans, paying, for, chinese, goods, with, the, precious, metal, european, and, american, ships, were, able, to, arrive, in, guangzhou, with, their, holds, filled, with, opium, sell, their, cargo, use, the, proceeds, to, buy, chinese, goods, and, turn, a, profit, in, the, form, of, silver, bullion, this, silver, would, then, be, used, to, acquire, more, chinese, goods, while, opium, remained, the, most, profitable, good, to, trade, with, china, foreign, merchants, began, to, export, other, cargoes, such, as, machine, spun, cotton, cloth, rattan, ginseng, fur, clocks, and, steel, tools, however, these, goods, never, reached, the, same, level, of, importance, as, narcotics, nor, were, they, as, lucrative, the, qing, imperial, court, debated, whether, or, how, to, end, the, opium, trade, but, their, efforts, to, curtail, opium, abuse, were, complicated, by, local, officials, and, the, cohong, who, profited, greatly, from, the, bribes, and, taxes, involved, in, the, narcotics, trade, efforts, by, qing, officials, to, curb, opium, imports, through, regulations, on, consumption, resulted, in, an, increase, in, drug, smuggling, by, european, and, chinese, traders, and, corruption, was, rampant, in, 1810, the, daoguang, emperor, issued, an, edict, concerning, the, opium, crisis, declaring, opium, has, a, harm, opium, is, a, poison, undermining, our, good, customs, and, morality, its, use, is, prohibited, by, law, now, the, commoner, yang, dares, to, bring, it, into, the, forbidden, city, indeed, he, flouts, the, law, however, recently, the, purchasers, eaters, and, consumers, of, opium, have, become, numerous, deceitful, merchants, buy, and, sell, it, to, gain, profit, the, customs, house, at, the, ch, ung, wen, gate, was, originally, set, up, to, supervise, the, collection, of, imports, it, had, no, responsibility, with, regard, to, opium, smuggling, if, we, confine, our, search, for, opium, to, the, seaports, we, fear, the, search, will, not, be, sufficiently, thorough, we, should, also, order, the, general, commandant, of, the, police, and, police, censors, at, the, five, gates, to, prohibit, opium, and, to, search, for, it, at, all, gates, if, they, capture, any, violators, they, should, immediately, punish, them, and, should, destroy, the, opium, at, once, as, to, kwangtung, and, fukien, the, provinces, from, which, opium, comes, we, order, their, viceroys, governors, and, superintendents, of, the, maritime, customs, to, conduct, a, thorough, search, for, opium, and, cut, off, its, supply, they, should, in, no, ways, consider, this, order, a, dead, letter, and, allow, opium, to, be, smuggled, out, nonetheless, by, 1831, the, annual, opium, traffic, neared, 20, 000, chests, each, with, a, net, weight, of, around, 140, pounds, compared, with, just, about, 4, 000, chests, per, year, between, 1800, and, 1818, after, the, east, india, company, s, monopoly, on, tea, ended, in, 1833, and, private, merchants, began, to, join, in, this, quantity, would, go, on, to, double, before, the, close, of, the, decade, in, addition, to, the, start, of, the, opium, trade, economic, and, social, innovations, led, to, a, change, in, the, parameters, of, the, wider, sino, european, trade, the, formulation, of, classical, economics, by, adam, smith, and, other, economic, theorists, caused, academic, belief, in, mercantilism, to, decline, in, britain, under, the, prior, system, the, qianlong, emperor, restricted, trade, with, foreigners, on, chinese, soil, only, for, licensed, chinese, merchants, while, the, british, government, on, their, part, issued, a, monopoly, charter, for, trade, only, to, the, british, east, india, company, this, arrangement, was, not, challenged, until, the, 19th, century, when, the, idea, of, free, trade, was, popularised, in, the, west, fueled, by, the, industrial, revolution, britain, began, to, use, its, growing, naval, power, to, spread, a, broadly, liberal, economic, model, encompassing, open, markets, and, relatively, barrier, free, international, trade, a, policy, in, line, with, the, credo, of, smithian, economics, this, stance, on, trade, was, intended, to, open, foreign, markets, to, the, resources, of, britain, s, colonies, as, well, as, provide, the, british, public, with, greater, access, to, consumer, goods, such, as, tea, in, great, britain, the, adoption, of, the, gold, standard, in, 1821, resulted, in, the, empire, minting, standardised, silver, shillings, further, reducing, the, availability, of, silver, for, trade, in, asia, and, spurring, the, british, government, to, press, for, more, trading, rights, in, china, in, contrast, to, this, new, economic, model, the, qing, dynasty, continued, to, employ, a, confucian, modernist, highly, organised, economic, philosophy, that, called, for, strict, government, intervention, in, industry, for, the, sake, of, preserving, societal, stability, while, the, qing, government, was, not, explicitly, anti, trade, a, lack, of, need, for, imports, and, increasingly, heavy, taxes, on, luxury, goods, limited, pressure, on, the, government, to, open, further, ports, to, international, trade, china, s, rigid, merchant, hierarchy, also, blocked, efforts, to, open, ports, to, foreign, ships, and, businesses, chinese, merchants, operating, in, inland, china, wanted, to, avoid, market, fluctuations, caused, by, importing, foreign, goods, that, would, compete, with, domestic, production, while, the, cohong, families, of, guangzhou, profited, greatly, by, keeping, their, city, the, only, entry, point, for, foreign, products, at, the, turn, of, the, 19th, century, countries, such, as, great, britain, the, netherlands, denmark, russia, and, the, united, states, began, to, seek, additional, trading, rights, in, china, foremost, among, the, concerns, of, the, western, nations, was, the, end, of, the, canton, system, and, the, opening, of, china, s, vast, consumer, markets, to, trade, britain, in, particular, was, keenly, increasing, its, exports, to, china, as, the, empire, s, implementation, of, the, gold, standard, forced, it, to, purchase, silver, and, gold, from, continental, europe, and, mexico, to, further, fuel, its, rapidly, industrialising, economy, attempts, by, a, british, embassy, led, by, macartney, in, 1793, a, dutch, mission, under, jacob, pieter, van, braam, in, 1794, russia, headed, by, yury, golovkin, in, 1805, and, the, british, again, earl, william, amherst, in, 1816, to, negotiate, increased, access, to, the, chinese, market, were, all, vetoed, by, successive, qing, emperors, upon, his, meeting, the, jiaqing, emperor, in, 1816, amherst, refused, to, perform, the, traditional, kowtow, an, act, that, the, qing, saw, as, a, severe, breach, of, etiquette, amherst, and, his, party, were, expelled, from, china, a, diplomatic, rebuke, that, angered, the, british, government, one, major, reason, was, that, british, consumers, had, developed, a, strong, liking, for, chinese, tea, as, well, as, other, goods, like, porcelain, and, silk, but, chinese, consumers, had, no, similar, preference, for, any, goods, produced, in, britain, because, of, this, trade, imbalance, britain, increasingly, had, to, use, silver, to, pay, for, its, expanding, purchases, of, chinese, goods, britain, suffered, from, a, huge, trade, deficit, during, the, sino, british, trade, meanwhile, the, high, tariff, made, the, british, government, very, dissatisfied, with, the, qing, government, the, chinese, only, allowed, silver, in, exchange, for, the, products, they, were, offering, so, a, significant, amount, of, this, commodity, was, leaving, the, british, empire, as, its, merchants, gained, increasing, influence, in, china, great, britain, bolstered, its, military, strength, in, southern, china, britain, began, sending, warships, to, combat, piracy, on, the, pearl, river, and, in, 1808, established, a, permanent, garrison, of, british, troops, in, macau, to, defend, against, french, attacks, as, the, opium, fuelled, china, trade, increased, in, scope, and, value, the, foreign, presence, in, guangzhou, and, macau, grew, in, size, and, influence, the, thirteen, factories, district, of, guangzhou, continued, to, expand, and, was, labelled, the, foreign, quarter, a, small, population, of, merchants, began, to, stay, in, guangzhou, year, round, most, merchants, lived, in, macau, for, the, summer, months, then, moved, to, guangzhou, in, the, winter, and, a, local, chamber, of, commerce, was, formed, in, the, first, two, decades, of, the, 19th, century, the, increasingly, sophisticated, and, profitable, trade, between, europe, and, china, allowed, for, a, clique, of, european, merchants, to, rise, to, positions, of, great, importance, in, china, the, most, notable, of, these, figures, were, william, jardine, and, james, matheson, who, went, on, to, found, jardine, matheson, british, merchants, who, operated, a, consignment, and, shipping, business, in, guangzhou, and, macau, with, associates, such, as, jamsetjee, jejeebhoy, who, became, their, principal, supplier, in, india, while, all, three, dealt, in, legal, goods, they, also, profited, greatly, from, selling, opium, jardine, in, particular, was, effective, in, navigating, the, political, environment, of, guangzhou, to, allow, for, more, narcotics, to, be, smuggled, into, china, he, was, also, contemptuous, of, the, chinese, legal, system, and, often, used, his, economic, influence, to, subvert, chinese, authorities, this, included, his, with, matheson, s, support, petitioning, for, the, british, government, to, attempt, to, gain, trading, rights, and, political, recognition, from, imperial, china, by, force, if, necessary, in, addition, to, trade, some, western, missionaries, arrived, and, began, to, proselytise, christianity, to, the, chinese, while, some, officials, tolerated, this, macau, based, jesuits, had, been, active, in, china, since, the, early, 17th, century, some, officials, clashed, with, chinese, christians, raising, tensions, between, western, merchants, and, qing, officials, while, the, foreign, community, in, guangzhou, grew, in, influence, the, local, government, began, to, suffer, from, civil, discord, inside, china, the, white, lotus, rebellion, 1796, 1804, drained, the, qing, dynasty, s, treasury, of, silver, forcing, the, government, to, levy, increasingly, heavy, taxes, on, merchants, these, taxes, did, not, abate, after, the, rebellion, was, crushed, as, the, chinese, government, began, a, massive, project, to, repair, state, owned, properties, on, the, yellow, river, referred, to, as, the, yellow, river, conservancy, the, merchants, of, guangzhou, were, further, expected, to, make, contributions, to, fight, banditry, these, taxes, weighed, heavily, on, the, profits, made, by, the, cohong, merchants, by, the, 1830s, the, once, prosperous, cohong, had, seen, their, wealth, greatly, reduced, in, addition, the, declining, value, of, china, s, domestic, currency, resulted, in, many, people, in, guangzhou, using, foreign, silver, coins, spanish, coins, were, the, most, valued, followed, by, american, coins, as, they, contained, higher, amounts, of, silver, using, western, coins, allowed, cantonese, coiners, to, make, many, chinese, coins, from, melted, down, western, coins, greatly, increasing, the, city, s, wealth, and, tax, revenue, while, tying, much, of, the, economy, of, the, city, to, the, foreign, merchants, a, significant, development, came, in, 1834, when, reformers, some, of, whom, were, financially, backed, by, jardine, in, britain, advocating, for, free, trade, succeeded, in, ending, the, monopoly, of, the, british, east, india, company, under, the, charter, act, of, the, previous, year, this, shift, in, trade, policy, ended, the, need, for, merchants, to, comply, with, the, royal, charter, for, trade, in, the, far, east, with, this, centuries, old, restriction, lifted, the, british, china, trade, was, opened, to, private, entrepreneurs, many, of, whom, joined, the, highly, profitable, opium, trade, on, the, eve, of, the, qing, government, s, crackdown, on, opium, a, chinese, official, described, the, changes, in, society, caused, by, the, drug, at, the, beginning, opium, smoking, was, confined, to, the, fops, of, wealthy, families, who, took, up, the, habit, as, a, form, of, conspicuous, consumption, even, they, knew, that, they, should, not, indulge, in, it, to, the, greatest, extreme, later, people, of, all, social, strata, from, government, officials, and, members, of, the, gentry, to, craftsmen, merchants, entertainers, and, servants, and, even, women, buddhist, monks, and, nuns, and, taoist, priests, took, up, the, habit, and, openly, bought, and, equipped, themselves, with, smoking, instruments, even, in, the, center, of, our, dynasty, the, nation, s, capital, and, its, surrounding, areas, some, of, the, inhabitants, have, also, been, contaminated, by, this, dreadful, poison, in, late, 1834, to, accommodate, the, revocation, of, the, east, india, company, s, monopoly, the, british, sent, william, john, napier, to, macau, along, with, john, francis, davis, and, sir, george, robinson, 2nd, baronet, as, british, superintendents, of, trade, in, china, napier, was, instructed, to, obey, chinese, regulations, communicate, directly, with, chinese, authorities, superintend, trade, pertaining, to, the, contraband, trade, of, opium, and, to, survey, china, s, coastline, upon, his, arrival, in, china, napier, tried, to, circumvent, the, restrictive, system, that, forbade, direct, contact, with, chinese, officials, by, sending, a, letter, directly, to, the, viceroy, of, liangguang, lu, kun, requesting, a, meeting, the, viceroy, refused, to, accept, it, and, on, 2, september, of, that, year, an, edict, was, issued, that, temporarily, closed, british, trade, in, response, napier, ordered, two, royal, navy, vessels, to, bombard, chinese, forts, on, the, pearl, river, straight, the, bocca, tigris, in, a, show, of, force, this, command, was, followed, through, but, war, was, avoided, due, to, napier, falling, ill, with, typhus, and, ordering, a, retreat, the, brief, gunnery, duel, drew, condemnation, by, the, chinese, government, as, well, as, criticism, from, the, british, government, and, foreign, merchants, other, nationalities, such, as, the, americans, prospered, through, their, continued, peaceful, trade, with, china, but, the, british, were, told, to, leave, guangzhou, for, either, whampoa, or, macau, lord, napier, was, forced, to, return, to, macau, in, september, where, he, died, of, typhus, a, month, later, on, 11, october, after, lord, napier, s, death, captain, charles, elliot, received, the, king, s, commission, as, superintendent, of, trade, in, 1836, to, continue, napier, s, work, of, conciliating, the, chinese, by, 1838, the, british, were, selling, roughly, 1, 400, long, tons, 1, 400, 000, kg, of, opium, per, year, to, china, legalization, of, the, opium, trade, was, the, subject, of, ongoing, debate, within, the, chinese, administration, but, a, proposal, to, legalise, the, narcotic, was, repeatedly, rejected, and, in, 1838, the, government, began, to, actively, sentence, chinese, drug, traffickers, to, death, there, were, also, long, term, factors, that, pushed, the, chinese, government, into, action, historian, jonathan, d, spence, lists, these, factors, that, led, to, war, in, 1839, the, daoguang, emperor, appointed, scholar, official, lin, zexu, to, the, post, of, special, imperial, commissioner, with, the, task, of, eradicating, the, opium, trade, lin, s, famous, open, letter, to, queen, victoria, appealed, to, queen, victoria, s, moral, reasoning, citing, what, he, mistakenly, understood, to, be, a, strict, prohibition, on, opium, within, great, britain, lin, questioned, how, britain, could, declare, itself, moral, while, its, merchants, profited, from, the, legal, sale, in, china, of, a, drug, that, was, banned, in, britain, he, wrote, your, majesty, has, not, before, been, thus, officially, notified, and, you, may, plead, ignorance, of, the, severity, of, our, laws, but, i, now, give, my, assurance, that, we, mean, to, cut, this, harmful, drug, forever, the, letter, never, reached, the, queen, with, one, source, suggesting, that, it, was, lost, in, transit, lin, pledged, that, nothing, would, divert, him, from, his, mission, if, the, traffic, in, opium, were, not, stopped, a, few, decades, from, now, we, shall, not, only, be, without, soldiers, to, resist, the, enemy, but, also, in, want, of, silver, to, provide, an, army, lin, banned, the, sale, of, opium, and, demanded, that, all, supplies, of, the, drug, be, surrendered, to, the, chinese, authorities, he, also, closed, the, pearl, river, channel, trapping, british, traders, in, guangzhou, as, well, as, seizing, opium, stockpiles, in, warehouses, and, the, thirteen, factories, chinese, troops, boarded, british, ships, in, the, pearl, river, and, south, china, sea, before, destroying, the, opium, on, board, the, british, superintendent, of, trade, in, china, charles, elliot, protested, the, decision, to, forcibly, seize, the, opium, stockpiles, he, ordered, all, ships, carrying, opium, to, flee, and, prepare, for, battle, lin, responded, by, besieging, the, foreign, dealers, in, the, foreign, quarter, of, guangzhou, and, kept, them, from, communicating, with, their, ships, in, port, to, defuse, the, situation, elliot, convinced, the, british, traders, to, cooperate, with, chinese, authorities, and, hand, over, their, opium, stockpiles, with, the, promise, of, eventual, compensation, for, their, losses, by, the, british, government, while, this, amounted, to, a, tacit, acknowledgment, that, the, british, government, did, not, disapprove, of, the, trade, it, also, placed, a, huge, liability, on, the, exchequer, this, promise, and, the, inability, of, the, british, government, to, pay, it, without, causing, a, political, storm, was, used, as, an, important, casus, belli, for, the, subsequent, british, attack, during, april, and, may, 1839, british, and, american, dealers, surrendered, 20, 283, chests, and, 200, sacks, of, opium, the, stockpile, was, publicly, destroyed, on, the, beach, outside, guangzhou, after, the, opium, was, surrendered, trade, was, restarted, on, the, strict, condition, that, no, more, opium, be, shipped, into, china, looking, for, a, way, to, effectively, police, foreign, trade, and, purge, corruption, lin, and, his, advisers, decided, to, reform, the, existing, bond, system, under, this, system, a, foreign, captain, and, the, cohong, merchant, who, had, purchased, the, goods, off, of, his, ship, swore, that, the, vessel, carried, no, illegal, goods, upon, examining, the, records, of, the, port, lin, was, infuriated, to, find, that, in, the, 20, years, since, opium, had, been, declared, illegal, not, a, single, infraction, had, been, reported, as, a, consequence, lin, demanded, that, all, foreign, merchants, and, qing, officials, sign, a, new, bond, promising, not, to, deal, in, opium, under, penalty, of, death, the, british, government, opposed, their, signing, of, the, bond, feeling, that, it, violated, the, principle, of, free, trade, but, some, merchants, who, did, not, trade, in, opium, such, as, olyphant, co, were, willing, to, sign, against, elliot, s, orders, trade, in, regular, goods, continued, unabated, and, the, scarcity, of, opium, caused, by, the, seizure, of, the, foreign, warehouses, caused, the, black, market, to, flourish, some, newly, arrived, merchant, ships, were, able, to, learn, of, the, ban, on, opium, before, they, entered, the, pearl, river, estuary, and, so, they, unloaded, their, cargoes, at, lintin, island, the, opportunity, caused, by, the, sharp, rise, in, the, price, of, opium, was, seized, upon, by, some, of, the, cohong, trading, houses, and, smugglers, who, were, able, to, evade, commissioner, lin, s, efforts, and, smuggled, more, opium, into, china, superintendent, elliot, was, aware, of, the, smugglers, activities, on, lintin, and, was, under, orders, to, stop, them, but, feared, that, any, action, by, the, royal, navy, could, spark, a, war, and, withheld, his, ships, in, early, july, 1839, a, group, of, british, merchant, sailors, in, kowloon, became, intoxicated, after, consuming, rice, liqueur, two, of, the, sailors, became, agitated, with, and, beat, to, death, lin, weixi, a, villager, from, nearby, tsim, sha, tsui, superintendent, elliot, ordered, the, arrest, of, the, two, men, and, paid, compensation, to, lin, s, family, and, village, however, he, refused, a, request, to, turn, the, sailors, over, to, chinese, authorities, fearing, they, would, be, killed, in, accordance, with, the, chinese, legal, code, commissioner, lin, saw, this, as, an, obstruction, of, justice, and, chinese, sovereignty, therefore, he, ordered, the, sailors, to, be, handed, over, elliot, instead, held, a, trial, for, the, accused, men, aboard, a, warship, at, sea, with, himself, serving, as, the, judge, and, merchant, captains, serving, as, jurors, he, invited, the, qing, authorities, to, observe, and, comment, on, the, proceedings, but, the, offer, was, declined, the, naval, court, convicted, 5, sailors, of, assault, and, rioting, and, sentenced, them, to, fines, along, with, hard, labour, in, britain, a, verdict, later, overturned, in, british, courts, angered, by, the, violation, of, china, s, sovereignty, lin, recalled, chinese, labourers, from, macau, and, issued, an, edict, preventing, the, sale, of, food, to, the, british, war, junks, were, deployed, to, the, mouth, of, the, pearl, river, while, signs, were, placed, and, rumours, spread, by, the, qing, that, they, had, poisoned, the, freshwater, springs, traditionally, used, to, restock, foreign, merchant, ships, on, 23, august, a, ship, belonging, to, a, prominent, opium, merchant, was, attacked, by, lascar, pirates, while, travelling, downriver, from, guangzhou, to, macau, rumors, spread, among, the, british, that, it, had, been, chinese, soldiers, who, had, attacked, the, ship, and, elliot, ordered, all, british, ships, to, leave, the, coast, of, china, by, 24, august, that, same, day, macau, barred, british, ships, from, its, harbour, at, the, request, of, lin, the, commissioner, travelled, in, person, to, the, city, where, he, was, welcomed, by, some, of, the, inhabitants, as, a, hero, who, had, restored, law, and, order, the, flight, from, macau, ensured, that, by, the, end, of, august, over, 60, british, ships, and, over, 2000, people, were, idling, off, of, the, chinese, coast, fast, running, out, of, provisions, on, 30, august, hms, volage, arrived, to, defend, the, fleet, from, a, potential, chinese, attack, and, elliot, warned, qing, authorities, in, kowloon, that, the, embargo, on, food, and, water, must, be, ended, soon, early, on, 4, september, elliot, dispatched, an, armed, schooner, and, a, cutter, to, kowloon, to, buy, provisions, from, chinese, peasants, the, two, ships, approached, three, chinese, war, junks, in, the, harbour, and, requested, permission, to, land, men, in, order, to, procure, supplies, the, british, were, allowed, through, and, basic, necessities, were, provided, to, the, british, by, chinese, sailors, but, the, chinese, commander, inside, kowloon, fort, refused, to, allow, the, locals, to, trade, with, the, british, and, confined, the, townspeople, inside, the, settlement, the, situation, grew, more, intense, as, the, day, went, on, and, in, the, afternoon, elliot, issued, an, ultimatum, that, if, the, chinese, refused, to, allow, the, british, to, purchase, supplies, they, would, be, fired, upon, a, 3, 00, pm, deadline, set, by, elliot, passed, and, the, british, ships, opened, fire, on, the, chinese, vessels, the, junks, returned, fire, and, chinese, gunners, on, land, began, to, fire, at, the, british, ships, nightfall, ended, the, battle, and, the, chinese, junks, withdrew, ending, what, would, be, known, as, the, battle, of, kowloon, many, british, officers, wanted, to, launch, a, land, attack, on, kowloon, fort, the, next, day, but, elliot, decided, against, it, stating, that, such, an, action, would, cause, great, injury, and, irritation, to, the, town, s, inhabitants, after, the, skirmish, elliot, circulated, a, paper, in, kowloon, reading, the, men, of, the, english, nation, desire, nothing, but, peace, but, they, cannot, submit, to, be, poisoned, and, starved, the, imperial, cruisers, they, have, no, wish, to, molest, or, impede, but, they, must, not, prevent, the, people, from, selling, to, deprive, men, of, food, is, the, act, only, of, the, unfriendly, and, hostile, having, driven, off, the, chinese, ships, the, british, fleet, began, to, purchase, provisions, from, the, local, villagers, often, with, the, aid, of, bribed, chinese, officials, in, kowloon, lai, enjue, the, local, commander, at, kowloon, declared, that, a, victory, had, been, won, against, the, british, he, claimed, that, a, two, masted, british, warship, had, been, sunk, and, that, 40, 50, british, had, been, killed, he, also, reported, that, the, british, had, been, unable, to, acquire, supplies, and, his, reports, severely, understated, the, strength, of, the, royal, navy, in, late, october, 1839, the, merchant, ship, thomas, coutts, arrived, in, china, and, sailed, to, guangzhou, thomas, coutts, s, quaker, owners, refused, on, religious, grounds, to, deal, in, opium, a, fact, that, the, chinese, authorities, were, aware, of, the, ship, s, captain, warner, believed, elliot, had, exceeded, his, legal, authority, by, banning, the, signing, of, the, no, opium, trade, bond, and, negotiated, with, the, governor, of, guangzhou, warner, hoped, that, all, british, ships, not, carrying, opium, could, negotiate, to, legally, unload, their, goods, at, chuenpi, an, island, near, humen, to, prevent, other, british, ships, from, following, thomas, coutts, s, precedent, elliot, ordered, a, blockade, of, british, shipping, in, the, pearl, river, fighting, began, on, 3, november, 1839, when, a, second, british, ship, royal, saxon, attempted, to, sail, to, guangzhou, the, royal, navy, ships, hms, volage, and, hms, hyacinth, fired, warning, shots, at, royal, saxon, in, response, to, this, commotion, a, fleet, of, chinese, war, junks, under, the, command, of, guan, tianpei, sailed, out, to, protect, royal, saxon, the, ensuing, battle, of, chuenpi, resulted, in, the, destruction, of, 4, chinese, war, junks, and, the, withdrawal, of, both, fleets, the, qing, navy, s, official, report, on, the, battle, of, chuenpi, claimed, that, the, navy, had, protected, the, british, merchant, vessel, and, reported, a, great, victory, for, the, day, in, reality, the, chinese, had, been, out, classed, by, the, british, vessels, and, several, chinese, ships, were, disabled, elliot, reported, that, his, squadron, was, protecting, the, 29, british, ships, in, chuenpi, and, began, to, prepare, for, the, qing, reprisal, fearing, that, the, chinese, would, reject, any, contacts, with, the, british, and, eventually, attack, with, fire, rafts, he, ordered, all, ships, to, leave, chuenpi, and, head, for, causeway, bay, 20, miles, 30, km, from, macau, hoping, that, offshore, anchorages, would, be, out, of, range, of, lin, elliot, asked, adri, o, ac, cio, da, silveira, pinto, the, portuguese, governor, of, macau, to, let, british, ships, load, and, unload, their, goods, there, in, exchange, for, paying, rents, and, any, duties, the, governor, refused, for, fear, that, the, chinese, would, discontinue, supplying, food, and, other, necessities, to, macau, and, on, 14, january, 1840, the, daoguang, emperor, asked, all, foreign, merchants, in, china, to, halt, material, assistance, to, the, british, following, the, chinese, crackdown, on, the, opium, trade, discussion, arose, as, to, how, britain, would, respond, as, the, public, in, the, united, states, and, britain, had, previously, expressed, outrage, that, britain, was, supporting, the, opium, trade, the, east, india, and, china, association, of, london, argued, that, the, opium, trade, was, directly, or, indirectly, sanctioned, by, the, government, and, as, such, they, should, compensate, them, for, their, losses, elliot, signed, certificates, guaranteeing, payment, for, the, surrendered, opium, with, the, assumption, that, china, would, pay, for, it, this, provided, legal, basis, for, the, merchants, to, demand, an, indemnity, from, the, british, government, which, they, could, either, force, china, to, pay, or, pay, for, it, from, the, british, treasury, as, the, government, had, no, funds, to, pay, such, indemnities, they, favoured, forcing, china, to, pay, since, elliot, had, provided, them, with, plausible, justification, for, a, china, expedition, many, british, citizens, sympathised, with, the, chinese, and, wanted, to, halt, the, sale, of, opium, while, others, wanted, to, contain, or, regulate, the, international, narcotics, trade, however, a, great, deal, of, anger, was, expressed, over, the, treatment, of, british, diplomats, and, towards, the, protectionist, trading, policies, of, qing, china, the, whig, controlled, government, in, particular, advocated, war, with, china, and, the, pro, whig, press, printed, stories, about, chinese, despotism, and, cruelty, this, line, of, reasoning, was, primary, defence, for, war, with, china, since, august, 1839, reports, had, been, published, in, london, newspapers, about, troubles, at, guangzhou, and, the, impending, war, with, china, the, queen, s, annual, address, to, the, house, of, lords, on, 16, january, 1840, expressed, the, concern, that, events, have, happened, in, china, which, have, occasioned, an, interruption, of, the, commercial, intercourse, of, my, subjects, with, that, country, i, have, given, and, shall, continue, to, give, the, most, serious, attention, to, a, matter, so, deeply, affecting, the, interests, of, my, subjects, and, the, dignity, of, my, crown, the, whig, melbourne, government, was, then, in, a, weak, political, situation, it, barely, survived, a, motion, of, non, confidence, on, 31, january, 1840, by, a, majority, of, 21, the, tories, saw, the, china, question, as, an, opportunity, to, beat, the, government, and, james, graham, moved, a, motion, on, 7, april, 1840, in, the, house, of, commons, censuring, the, government, s, want, of, foresight, and, precaution, and, their, neglect, to, furnish, the, superintendent, at, guangzhou, with, powers, and, instructions, to, deal, with, the, opium, trade, this, was, a, deliberate, move, of, the, tories, to, avoid, the, sensitive, issues, of, war, and, opium, trade, and, to, obtain, maximum, support, for, the, motion, within, the, party, calls, for, military, action, were, met, with, mixed, responses, when, the, matter, went, before, parliament, foreign, secretary, palmerston, a, politician, known, for, his, aggressive, foreign, policy, and, advocacy, for, free, trade, led, the, pro, war, camp, palmerston, strongly, believed, that, the, destroyed, opium, should, be, considered, property, not, contraband, and, as, such, reparations, had, to, be, made, for, its, destruction, he, justified, military, action, by, saying, that, no, one, could, say, that, he, honestly, believed, the, motive, of, the, chinese, government, to, have, been, the, promotion, of, moral, habits, and, that, the, war, was, being, fought, to, stem, china, s, balance, of, payments,

to, the, situation, in, china, one, letter, was, addressed, to, the, elliots, the, other, to, the, daoguang, emperor, and, the, qing, government, the, letter, to, the, emperor, informed, china, that, great, britain, had, sent, a, military, expeditionary, force, to, the, chinese, coast, in, the, letter, palmerston, stated, that, these, measures, of, hostility, on, the, part, of, great, britain, against, china, are, not, only, justified, but, even, rendered, absolutely, necessary, by, the, outrages, which, have, been, committed, by, the, chinese, authorities, against, british, officers, and, subjects, and, these, hostilities, will, not, cease, until, a, satisfactory, arrangement, shall, have, been, made, by, the, chinese, government, in, his, letter, to, the, elliots, palmerston,

would, send, another, copy, of, the, aforementioned, letter, to, beijing, palmerston, also, issued, a, list, of, objectives, that, the, british, government, wanted, accomplished, with, said, objectives, being, lord, palmerston, left, it, to, superintendent, elliot, s, discretion, as, to, how, these, objectives, would, be, fulfilled, but, noted, that, while, negotiation, would, be, a, preferable, outcome, he, did, not, trust, that, diplomacy, would, succeed, writing, to, sum, up, in, a, few, words, the, result, of, this, instruction, you, will, see, from, what, i, have, stated, that, the, british, government, demands, from, that, of, china, satisfaction, for, the, past, and, security, for, the, future, and, does, not, choose, to, trust, to, negotiation, for, obtaining, either, of, these, things, but, has, sent, out, a, naval, and, military, force, with, orders, to, begin, at, once, to, take, the, measures, necessary, for, attaining, the, object, in, view, the,

a, blow, that, forced, the, qing, navy, to, retreat, upriver, knowing, the, strategic, value, of, pearl, river, delta, to, china, and, aware, that, british, naval, superiority, made, a, reconquest, of, the, region, unlikely, qishan, attempted, to, prevent, the, war, from, widening, further, by, negotiating, a, peace, treaty, with, britain, on, 21, january, qishan, and, elliot, drafted, the,

letter, to, the, emperor, he, wrote, that, the, barbarians, had, begged, the, chief, general, that, he, would, implore, the, great, emperor, in, their, behalf, that, he, would, have, mercy, upon, them, and, cause, their, debts, to, be, repaid, them, and, graciously, permit, them, to, carry, on, their, commerce, when, they, would, immediately, withdraw, their, ships, from, the, bocca, tigris, and, never, dare, again, to, raise, any, disturbance, however, general, yang, fang, was, reprimanded, by, the, emperor, for, his, agreeing, to, a, truce, rather, than, forcefully, resisting, the, british, the, emperor, was, not, informed, the, british, expedition, had, not, been, defeated, and, was, very, much, intact, the, imperial, court, continued, to, debate, china, s, next, course, of, action, for, the, war, as, the, daoguang, emperor, wanted, hong, kong, retaken, following, their, withdrawal, from, guangzhou, the, british, relocated, the, expeditionary, force, to, hong, kong, just, as, with, the, chinese, commanders, the, british, leaders, debated, how, the, war, should, be, continued, elliot, wanted, to, cease, military, operations, and, reopen, trade, while, major, general, gough, wanted, to, capture, the, city, of, amoy, and, blockade, the, yangtze, river, in, july, a, typhoon, struck, hong, kong, damaging, british, ships, in, the, harbour, and, destroying, some, of, the, facilities, the, expedition, was, building, on, the, island, the, situation, changed, when, on, 29, july, elliot, was, informed, that, he, had, been, replaced, as, superintendent, by, henry, pottinger, who, arrived, in, hong, kong, on, 10, august, to, begin, his, administration, pottinger, wanted, to, negotiate, terms, with, the, qing, for, the, entire, country, of, china, rather, than, just, the, pearl, river, and, so, he, turned, away, chinese, envoys, from, guangzhou, and, gave, permission, for, the, expeditionary, force, to, proceed, with, its, war, plans, admiral, william, parker, 1st, baronet, of, shenstone, also, arrived, in, hong, kong, to, replace, humphrey, fleming, senhouse, who, had, died, of, a, fever, on, 29, june, as, the, commander, of, the, british, naval, forces, in, china, it, was, agreed, by, the, british, commanders, that, combat, operations, should, be, moved, north, to, put, pressure, on, peking, and, on, 21, august, the, fleet, sailed, for, amoy, on, 25, august, the, british, fleet, entered, the, jiulong, river, estuary, and, arrived, at, amoy, the, city, was, prepared, for, a, naval, assault, as, qing, military, engineers, had, built, several, artillery, batteries, into, the, granite, cliffs, overlooking, the, river, a, purely, naval, assault, was, considered, too, risky, by, parker, prompting, gough, to, order, a, combined, naval, and, ground, attack, on, the, defences, on, 26, august, british, marines, and, regular, infantry, under, the, covering, fire, of, the, royal, navy, flanked, and, destroyed, the, chinese, defences, guarding, the, river, several, large, british, ships, failed, to, destroy, the, largest, of, the, chinese, batteries, which, withstood, over, 12, 000, cannonballs, being, fired, at, it, so, the, position, was, scaled, and, captured, by, the, british, infantry, the, city, of, amoy, was, abandoned, on, 27, august, and, british, soldiers, entered, the, inner, town, where, they, blew, up, the, citadel, s, powder, magazine, 26, chinese, junks, and, 128, cannons, were, captured, with, the, captured, guns, being, thrown, into, the, river, by, the, british, as, lord, palmerston, wanted, amoy, to, become, an, international, trade, port, at, the, end, of, the, war, gough, ordered, that, no, looting, be, tolerated, and, had, officers, enforce, the, death, penalty, for, anyone, found, to, be, plundering, however, many, chinese, merchants, refused, to, ask, for, british, protection, out, of, fear, of, being, branded, as, traitors, to, the, qing, dynasty, the, british, withdrew, to, an, island, on, the, river, where, they, established, a, small, garrison, and, blockaded, the, jiulong, river, with, the, city, empty, of, any, army, peasants, criminals, and, deserters, looted, the, town, the, qing, army, retook, the, city, and, restored, order, several, days, later, after, which, the, city, governor, declared, that, a, victory, had, been, won, and, 5, british, ships, sunk, in, britain, changes, in, parliament, resulted, in, lord, palmerston, being, removed, from, his, post, as, foreign, minister, on, 30, august, william, lamb, 2nd, viscount, melbourne, replaced, him, and, sought, a, more, measured, approach, to, the, situation, in, china, lamb, remained, a, supporter, of, the, war, in, september, 1841, the, british, transport, ship, nerbudda, was, shipwrecked, on, a, reef, off, the, northern, coast, of, formosa, after, a, brief, gunnery, duel, with, a, chinese, fort, this, sinking, was, followed, by, the, loss, of, the, brig, ann, on, another, reef, in, march, 1842, the, survivors, of, both, ships, were, captured, and, marched, to, southern, taiwan, where, they, were, imprisoned, 197, were, executed, by, qing, authorities, on, 10, august, 1842, while, an, additional, 87, died, from, ill, treatment, in, captivity, this, became, known, as, the, nerbudda, incident, october, saw, the, british, solidify, their, control, over, the, central, chinese, coast, zhoushan, had, been, exchanged, for, hong, kong, on, the, authority, of, qishan, in, january, 1841, after, which, the, island, had, been, re, garrisoned, by, the, qing, fearing, that, the, chinese, would, improve, the, island, s, defences, the, british, began, a, military, invasion, the, british, attacked, the, qing, on, 1, october, the, battle, of, the, second, capture, of, chusan, ensued, the,

bombarded, and, captured, a, fort, on, the, outskirts, of, ningbo, in, central, china, a, battle, broke, out, between, the, british, army, and, a, chinese, force, of, 1500, men, on, the, road, between, the, town, of, chinhai, and, ningbo, during, which, the, chinese, were, routed, following, the, defeat, chinese, authorities, evacuated, ningbo, and, the, empty, city, was, taken, by, the, british, on, 13, october, an, imperial, cannon, manufactory, in, the, city, was, captured, by, the, british, reducing, the, ability, of, the, qing, to, replace, their, lost, equipment, and, the, fall, of, the, city, threatened, the, nearby, qiantang, river, the, capture, of, ningbo, forced, the, british, command, to, examine, their, policy, towards, occupied, chinese, territory, and, prizes, of, war, admiral, parker, and, superintendent, pottinger, wanted, a, percentage, of, all, captured, chinese, property, to, be, turned, over, to, the, british, as, legal, prizes, of, war, while, general, gough, argued, that, this, would, only, turn, the, chinese, population, against, the, british, and, that, if, property, had, to, be, seized, it, should, be, public, property, rather, than, private, british, policy, eventually, settled, that, 10, of, all, property, captured, by, the, british, expeditionary, forces, would, be, seized, as, war, loot, in, retaliation, for, injustices, done, to, british, merchants, gough, later, stated, that, this, edict, would, compel, his, men, to, punish, one, set, of, robbers, for, the, benefit, of, another, fighting, ceased, for, the, winter, of, 1841, while, the, british, resupplied, false, reports, sent, by, yishan, to, the, emperor, in, beijing, resulted, in, the, continued, british, threat, being, downplayed, in, late, 1841, the, daoguang, emperor, discovered, that, his, officials, in, guangzhou, and, amoy, had, been, sending, him, embellished, reports, he, ordered, the, governor, of, guangxi, liang, chang, ch, to, send, him, clear, accounts, of, the, events, in, guangzhou, noting, that, since, guangxi, was, a, neighbouring, province, liang, must, be, receiving, independent, accounts, he, warned, liang, that, he, would, be, able, to, verify, his, information, by, obtaining, secret, inquiries, from, other, places, yishan, was, recalled, to, the, capital, and, faced, trial, by, the, imperial, court, which, removed, him, from, command, now, aware, of, the, severity, of, the, british, threat, chinese, towns, and, cities, began, to, fortify, against, naval, incursions, in, the, spring, of, 1842, the, daoguang, emperor, ordered, his, cousin, yijing, to, retake, the, city, of, ningbo, in, the, ensuing, battle, of, ningpo, on, 10, march, the, british, garrison, repelled, the, assault, with, rifle, fire, and, naval,

chinese, army, capturing, the, nearby, city, of, cixi, on, 15, march, the, important, harbour, of, zhapu, was, captured, on, 18, may, in, the, battle, of, chapu, a, british, fleet, bombarded, the, town, forcing, its, surrender, a, holdout, of, 300, soldiers, of, the, eight, banners, stalled, the, advance, of, british, army, for, several, hours, an, act, of, heroism, that, was, commended, by, gough, with, many, chinese, ports, now, blockaded, or, under, british, occupation, major, general, gough, sought, to, cripple, the, finances, of, the, qing, empire, by, striking, up, the, yangtze,

and, local, civilians, qing, admiral, chen, huacheng, was, killed, while, defending, a, fort, in, woosong, the, fall, of, shanghai, left, the, vital, city, of, nanjing, vulnerable, the, qing, amassed, an, army, of, 56, 000, manchu, bannermen, and, han, green, standards, to, defend, liangjiang, province, and, strengthened, their, river, defences, on, the, yangtze, however, british, naval, activity, in, northern, china, led, to, resources, and, manpower, being, withdrawn, to, defend, against, a, feared, attack, on, beijing, the, qing, commander, in, liangjiang, province, released, 16, british, prisoners, with, the, hope, that, a, ceasefire, could, be, reached, but, poor, communications, led, both, the, qing, and, the, british, to, reject, any, overtures, at, peace, in, secret, the, daoguang, emperor, considered, signing, a, peace, treaty, with, the, british, but, only, in, regards, to, the, yangtze, river, and, not, the, war, as, a, whole, had, it, been, signed, the, british, forces, would, have, been, paid, to, not, enter, the, yangtze, river, on, 14, july, the, british, fleet, on, the, yangtze, began, to, sail, up, the, river, reconnaissance, alerted, gough, to, the, logistical, importance, of, the, city, of, zhenjiang, and, plans, were, made, to, capture, it, most, of, the, city, s, guns, had, been, relocated, to, wusong, and, had, been, captured, by, the, british, when, said, city, had, been, taken, the, qing, commanders, inside, the, city, were, disorganised, with, chinese, sources, stating, that, over, 100, traitors, were, executed, in, zhenjiang, prior, to, the, battle, the, british, fleet, arrived, off, of, the, city, on, the, morning, of, 21, july, and, the, chinese, forts, defending, the, city, were, blasted, apart, the, chinese, defenders, initially, retreated, into, the, surrounding, hills, causing, a, premature, british, landing, fighting, erupted, when, thousands, of, chinese, soldiers, emerged, from, the, city, beginning, the, battle, of, chinkiang, british, engineers, blew, open, the, western, gate, and, stormed, into, the, city, where, fierce, street, to, street, fighting, ensued, zhenjiang, was, devastated, by, the, battle, with, many, chinese, soldiers, and, their, families, committing, suicide, rather, than, be, taken, prisoner, the, british, suffered, their, highest, combat, losses, of, the, war, 36, killed, taking, the, city, after, capturing, zhenjiang, the, british, fleet, cut, the, vital, grand, canal, paralysing, the, caoyun, system, and, severely, disrupting, the, chinese, ability, to, distribute, grain, throughout, the, empire, the, british, departed, zhenjiang, on, 3, august, intending, to, sail, to, nanking, they, arrived, outside, the, jiangning, district, on, 9, august, and, were, in, position, to, assault, the, city, by, 11, august, although, explicit, permission, to, negotiate, had, not, yet, been, granted, by, the, emperor, qing, officials, inside, the, city, agreed, to, a, british, request, to, negotiate, on, 14, august, a, chinese, delegation, led, by, the, manchu, high, court, official, keying, and, llipu, departed, nanking, for, the, british, fleet, negotiations, lasted, for, several, weeks, as, the, british, delegation, insisted, the, treaty, be, accepted, by, the, daoguang, emperor, the, court, advised, the, emperor, to, accept, the, treaty, and, on, 21, august, the, daoguang, emperor, authorised, his, diplomats, to, sign, the, peace, treaty, with, the, british, the, first, opium, war, officially, ended, on, 29, august, 1842, with, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, nanking, the, document, was, signed, by, officials, of, the, british, and, qing, empires, aboard, hms, cornwallis, the, british, military, superiority, during, the, conflict, drew, heavily, on, the, strength, of, the, royal, navy, british, warships, carried, more, guns, than, their, chinese, opponents, and, were, manoeuvrable, enough, to, evade, chinese, boarding, actions, steam, ships, such, as, the, nemesis, were, able, to, move, against, winds, and, tides, in, chinese, rivers, and, were, armed, with, heavy, guns, and, congreve, rockets, several, of, the, larger, british, warships, in, china, notably, the, third, rates, hms, cornwallis, hms, wellesley, and, hms, melville, carried, more, guns, than, entire, fleets, of, chinese, junks, british, naval, superiority, allowed, the, royal, navy, to, attack, chinese, forts, with, very, little, risk, to, themselves, as, british, naval, cannons, out, ranged, the, vast, majority, of, the, qing, artillery, british, soldiers, in, china, were, equipped, with, brunswick, rifles, and, rifle, modified, brown, bess, muskets, both, of, which, possessed, an, effective, firing, range, of, 200, 300, metres, british, marines, were, equipped, with, percussion, caps, that, greatly, reduced, weapon, misfires, and, allowed, firearms, to, be, used, in, damp, environments, in, terms, of, gunpowder, the, british, formula, was, better, manufactured, and, contained, more, sulphur, than, the, chinese, mixture, this, granted, british, weapons, an, advantage, in, terms, of, range, accuracy, and, projectile, velocity, british, artillery, was, lighter, owing, to, improved, forging, methods, and, more, manoeuvrable, than, the, cannons, used, by, the, chinese, as, with, the, naval, artillery, british, guns, out, ranged, the, chinese, cannon, in, terms, of, tactics, the, british, forces, in, china, followed, doctrines, established, during, the, napoleonic, wars, that, had, been, adapted, during, the, various, colonial, wars, of, the, 1820s, and, 1830s, many, of, the, british, soldiers, deployed, to, china, were, veterans, of, colonial, wars, in, india, and, had, experience, fighting, larger, but, technologically, inferior, armies, in, battle, the, british, line, infantry, would, advance, towards, the, enemy, in, columns, forming, ranks, once, they, had, closed, to, firing, range, companies, would, commence, firing, volleys, into, the, enemy, ranks, until, they, retreated, if, a, position, needed, to, be, taken, an, advance, or, charge, with, bayonets, would, be, ordered, light, infantry, companies, screened, the, line, infantry, formations, protecting, their, flanks, and, utilising, skirmishing, tactics, to, disrupt, the, enemy, british, artillery, was, used, to, destroy, the, qing, artillery, and, break, up, enemy, formations, during, the, conflict, the, british, superiority, in, range, rate, of, fire, and, accuracy, allowed, the, infantry, to, deal, significant, damage, to, their, enemy, before, the, chinese, could, return, fire, the, use, of, naval, artillery, to, support, infantry, operations, allowed, the, british, to, take, cities, and, forts, with, minimal, casualties, the, overall, strategy, of, the, british, during, the, war, was, to, inhibit, the, finances, of, the, qing, empire, with, the, ultimate, goal, of, acquiring, a, colonial, possession, on, the, chinese, coast, this, was, accomplished, through, the, capture, of, chinese, cities, and, by, blockading, major, river, systems, once, a, fort, or, city, had, been, captured, the, british, would, destroy, the, local, arsenal, and, disable, all, of, the, captured, guns, they, would, then, move, on, to, the, next, target, leaving, a, small, garrison, behind, this, strategy, was, planned, and, implemented, by, major, general, gough, who, was, able, to, operate, with, minimal, input, from, the, british, government, after, superintendent, elliot, was, recalled, in, 1841, the, large, number, of, private, british, merchants, and, east, india, company, ships, deployed, in, singapore, and, the, india, colonies, ensured, that, the, british, forces, in, china, were, adequately, supplied, china, did, not, have, a, unified, navy, instead, allowing, individual, provinces, to, manage, naval, defenses, although, the, qing, had, invested, in, naval, defences, for, their, adjacent, seas, in, earlier, periods, after, the, death, of, the, qianlong, emperor, in, 1799, the, navy, decayed, as, more, attention, was, directed, to, suppressing, the, miao, rebellion, and, white, lotus, rebellion, these, conflicts, left, the, qing, treasury, bankrupt, the, remaining, naval, forces, were, badly, overstretched, undermanned, underfunded, and, uncoordinated, from, the, onset, of, the, war, the, chinese, navy, was, severely, disadvantaged, chinese, war, junks, were, intended, for, use, against, pirates, or, equivalent, types, of, vessels, and, were, more, effective, in, close, range, river, engagements, due, to, their, ships, slow, speeds, qing, captains, consistently, found, themselves, sailing, towards, much, more, manoeuvrable, british, ships, and, as, a, consequence, the, chinese, could, only, use, their, bow, guns, the, size, of, the, british, ships, made, traditional, boarding, tactics, useless, and, the, junks, carried, smaller, numbers, of, inferior, weaponry, in, addition, the, chinese, ships, were, poorly, armoured, in, several, battles, british, shells, and, rockets, penetrated, chinese, magazines, and, detonated, gunpowder, stores, highly, manoeuvrable, steamships, such, as, hms, nemesis, could, decimate, small, fleets, of, junks, as, the, junks, had, little, chance, of, catching, up, to, and, engaging, the, faster, british, steamers, the, only, western, style, warship, in, the, qing, navy, the, converted, east, indiaman, cambridge, was, destroyed, in, the, battle, of, first, bar, apparently, the, chinese, emperor, was, aware, of, this, in, an, 1842, edict, he, said, the, invasion, by, the, rebellious, barbarians, they, depended, upon, their, strong, ships, and, effective, guns, to, commit, outrageous, acts, on, the, seas, and, harm, our, people, largely, because, the, native, war, junks, are, too, small, to, match, them, for, this, reason, i, the, emperor, repeatedly, ordered, our, generals, to, resist, on, land, and, not, to, fight, on, seas, when, the, enemy, ships, come, no, resistance, can, be, offered, when, they, go, away, no, means, of, pursuit, are, available, in, my, opinion, what, the, rebellious, barbarians, rely, upon, is, the, fact, that, chinese, war, junks, are, incapable, of, going, out, to, sea, to, fight, them, the, defensive, nature, of, the, conflict, resulted, in, the, chinese, relying, heavily, on, an, extensive, network, of, fortifications, the, kangxi, emperor, 1654, 1722, began, the, construction, of, river, defences, to, combat, pirates, and, encouraged, the, use, of, western, style, cannons, by, the, time, of, the, first, opium, war, multiple, forts, defended, most, major, chinese, cities, and, waterways, although, the, forts, were, well, armed, and, strategically, positioned, the, qing, defeat, exposed, major, flaws, in, their, design, the, cannons, used, in, the, qing, defensive, fortifications, were, a, collection, of, chinese, portuguese, spanish, and, british, pieces, the, domestically, produced, chinese, cannon, were, crafted, using, sub, par, forging, methods, limiting, their, effectiveness, in, combat, and, causing, excessive, gun, barrel, wear, the, chinese, blend, of, gunpowder, also, contained, more, charcoal, than, the, british, mixture, did, while, this, made, it, more, stable, and, thus, easier, to, store, it, also, limited, its, potential, as, a, propellant, decreasing, projectile, range, and, accuracy, overall, chinese, cannon, technology, was, considered, to, be, 200, years, behind, that, of, the, british, chinese, forts, were, unable, to, withstand, attacks, by, european, weaponry, as, they, were, designed, without, angled, glacis, and, many, did, not, have, protected, magazines, the, limited, range, of, the, qing, cannon, allowed, the, british, to, bombard, the, qing, defences, from, a, safe, distance, then, land, soldiers, to, storm, them, with, minimal, risk, many, of, the, larger, chinese, guns, were, built, as, fixed, emplacements, and, were, unable, to, be, maneuvered, to, fire, at, british, ships, the, failure, of, the, qing, fortifications, coupled, with, the, chinese, underestimation, of, the, royal, navy, allowed, the, british, to, force, their, way, up, major, rivers, and, impede, qing, logistics, most, notably, the, powerful, series, of, forts, at, humen, were, well, positioned, to, stop, an, invader, from, proceeding, upriver, to, guangzhou, but, it, had, not, been, considered, that, an, enemy, would, attack, and, destroy, the, forts, themselves, as, the, british, did, during, the, war, at, the, start, of, the, war, the, qing, army, consisted, of, over, 200, 000, soldiers, with, around, 800, 000, men, being, able, to, be, called, for, war, these, forces, consisted, of, manchu, bannermen, the, green, standard, army, provincial, militias, and, imperial, garrisons, the, qing, armies, were, armed, with, matchlocks, and, shotguns, which, had, an, effective, range, of, 100, metres, chinese, historians, liu, and, zhang, note, that, the, chinese, soldiers, were, equipped, with, sixty, or, seventy, percent, traditional, weapons, of, which, the, most, important, were, the, long, lance, the, side, sword, the, bow, and, arrow, and, the, rattan, shield, and, only, thirty, or, forty, percent, gunpowder, weapons, of, which, the, most, important, were, the, matchlock, musket, the, heavy, musket, the, cannon, the, fire, arrow, and, the, earthshaking, bomb, and, such, things, chinese, soldiers, were, also, equipped, with, halberds, spears, swords, and, crossbows, the, qing, dynasty, also, employed, large, batteries, of, artillery, in, battle, the, tactics, of, the, qing, remained, consistent, with, what, they, had, been, in, previous, centuries, soldiers, with, firearms, would, form, ranks, and, fire, volleys, into, the, enemy, while, men, armed, with, spears, and, pikes, would, drive, the, enemy, off, of, the, battlefield, cavalry, was, used, to, break, infantry, formations, and, pursue, routed, enemies, while, qing, artillery, was, used, to, scatter, enemy, formations, and, destroy, fortifications, during, the, first, opium, war, these, tactics, were, unable, to, successfully, deal, with, british, firepower, chinese, melee, formations, were, decimated, by, artillery, and, chinese, soldiery, armed, with, matchlocks, could, not, effectively, exchange, fire, with, british, ranks, who, greatly, outranged, them, most, battles, of, the, war, were, fought, in, cities, or, on, cliffs, and, riverbanks, limiting, the, qing, usage, of, cavalry, many, qing, cannon, were, destroyed, by, british, counter, battery, fire, and, british, light, infantry, companies, were, consistently, able, to, outflank, and, capture, chinese, artillery, batteries, a, british, officer, said, of, the, opposing, qing, forces, the, chinese, are, robust, muscular, fellows, and, no, cowards, the, tartars, desperate, but, neither, are, well, commanded, nor, acquainted, with, european, warfare, having, had, however, experience, of, three, of, them, i, am, inclined, to, suppose, that, a, tartar, bullet, is, not, a, whit, softer, than, a, french, one, the, strategy, of, the, qing, dynasty, during, the, war, was, to, prevent, the, british, from, seizing, chinese, territory, this, defensive, strategy, was, hampered, by, the, qing, severely, underestimating, the, capacity, of, the, british, military, qing, defences, on, the, pearl, and, yangtze, rivers, were, ineffective, in, stopping, the, british, push, inland, and, superior, naval, artillery, prevented, the, chinese, from, retaking, cities, the, qing, imperial, bureaucracy, was, unable, to, react, quickly, to, the, prodding, british, attacks, while, officials, and,

member, of, parliament, gladstone, called, it, most, infamous, and, atrocious, referring, to, the, opium, trade, between, china, and, british, india, in, particular, gladstone, was, fiercely, against, both, of, the, opium, wars, britain, waged, in, china, the, first, opium, war, initiated, in, 1840, and, the, second, opium, war, initiated, in, 1857, he, denounced, british, violence, against, the, chinese, and, was, ardently, opposed, to, the, british, trade, in, opium, to, china, gladstone, lambasted, it, as, palmerston, s, opium, war, and, said, in, may, 1840, that, he, felt, in, dread, of, the, judgments, of, god, upon, england, for, our, national, iniquity, towards, china, gladstone, made, a, famous, speech, in, parliament, against, the, first, opium, war, gladstone, criticised, it, as, a, war, more, unjust, in, its, origin, a, war, more, calculated, in, its, progress, to, cover, this, country, with, permanent, disgrace, his, hostility, to, opium, stemmed, from, the, effects, opium, brought, upon, his, sister, helen, due, to, the, first, opium, war, brought, on, by, palmerston, there, was, initial, reluctance, to, join, the, government, of, peel, on, part, of, gladstone, before, 1841, the, war, marked, the, start, of, what, 20th, century, chinese, nationalists, called, the, century, of, humiliation, the, ease, with, which, the, british, forces, defeated, the, numerically, superior, chinese, armies, damaged, the, dynasty, s, prestige, the, treaty, of, nanking, was, a, step, to, opening, the, lucrative, chinese, market, to, global, commerce, and, the, opium, trade, the, interpretation, of, the, war, which, was, long, the, standard, in, the, people, s, republic, of, china, was, summarised, in, 1976, the, opium, war, in, which, the, chinese, people, fought, against, british, aggression, marked, the, beginning, of, modern, chinese, history, and, the, start, of, the, chinese, people, s, bourgeois, democratic, revolution, against, imperialism, and, feudalism, the, treaty, of, nanking, the, supplementary, treaty, of, the, bogue, and, two, french, and, american, agreements, were, all, unequal, treaties, signed, between, 1842, and, 1844, the, terms, of, these, treaties, undermined, china, s, traditional, mechanisms, of, foreign, relations, and, methods, of, controlled, trade, five, ports, were, opened, for, trade, gunboats, and, foreign, residence, guangzhou, xiamen, fuzhou, ningbo, and, shanghai, hong, kong, was, seized, by, the, british, to, become, a, free, and, open, port, tariffs, were, abolished, thus, preventing, the, chinese, from, raising, future, duties, to, protect, domestic, industries, and, extraterritorial, practices, exempted, westerners, from, chinese, law, this, made, them, subject, to, their, own, civil, and, criminal, laws, of, their, home, country, most, importantly, the, opium, problem, was, never, addressed, and, after, the, treaty, was, signed, opium, addiction, doubled, china, was, forced, to, pay, 21, million, silver, taels, as, an, indemnity, which, was, used, to, pay, compensation, for, the, traders, opium, destroyed, by, commissioner, lin, a, couple, of, years, after, the, treaties, were, signed, internal, rebellion, began, to, threaten, foreign, trade, due, to, the, qing, government, s, inability, to, control, collection, of, taxes, on, imported, goods, the, british, government, convinced, the, manchu, court, to, allow, westerners, to, partake, in, government, official, affairs, by, the, 1850s, the, chinese, maritime, customs, service, one, of, the, most, important, bureaucracies, in, the, manchu, government, was, partially, staffed, and, managed, by, western, foreigners, in, 1858, opium, was, legalised, and, would, remain, a, problem, commissioner, lin, often, referred, to, as, lin, the, clear, sky, for, his, moral, probity, was, made, a, scapegoat, he, was, blamed, for, ultimately, failing, to, stem, the, tide, of, opium, imports, and, usage, as, well, as, for, provoking, an, unwinnable, war, through, his, rigidity, and, lack, of, understanding, of, the, changing, world, nevertheless, as, the, chinese, nation, formed, in, the, 20th, century, lin, became, viewed, as, a, hero, and, has, been, immortalised, at, various, locations, around, china, the, first, opium, war, both, reflected, and, contributed, to, a, further, weakening, of, the, chinese, state, s, power, and, legitimacy, anti, qing, sentiment, grew, in, the, form, of, rebellions, such, as, the, taiping, rebellion, a, war, lasting, from, 1850, to, 1864, in, which, at, least, 20, million, chinese, died, the, decline, of, the, qing, dynasty, was, beginning, to, be, felt, by, much, of, the, chinese, population, the, impact, of, the, opium, habit, on, the, chinese, people, and, the, manner, in, which, the, british, imposed, their, power, to, guarantee, the, profitable, trade, have, been, staples, of, chinese, historiography, ever, since, the, british, historian, jasper, ridley, concluded, conflict, between, china, and, britain, was, inevitable, on, the, one, side, was, a, corrupt, decadent, and, caste, ridden, despotism, with, no, desire, or, ability, to, wage, war, which, relied, on, custom, much, more, than, force, for, the, enforcement, of, extreme, privilege, and, discrimination, and, which, was, blinded, by, a, deep, rooted, superiority, complex, into, believing, that, they, could, assert, their, supremacy, over, europeans, without, possessing, military, power, on, the, other, side, was, the, most, economically, advanced, nation, in, the, world, a, nation, of, pushing, bustling, traders, of, self, help, free, trade, and, the, pugnacious, qualities, of, john, bull, however, ridley, adds, opposition, in, britain, was, intense, an, entirely, opposite, british, viewpoint, was, promoted, by, humanitarians, and, reformers, such, as, the, chartists, and, religious, nonconformists, led, by, a, young, gladstone, they, argued, that, palmerston, the, foreign, secretary, was, only, interested, in, the, huge, profits, it, would, bring, britain, and, was, totally, oblivious, to, the, horrible, moral, evils, of, opium, which, the, chinese, government, was, valiantly, trying, to, stamp, out, the, american, historian, john, k, fairbank, wrote, in, demanding, diplomatic, equality, and, commercial, opportunity, britain, represented, all, the, western, states, which, would, sooner, or, later, have, demanded, the, same, things, if, britain, had, not, it, was, an, accident, of, history, that, the, dynamic, british, commercial, interests, in, the, china, trade, was, centered, not, only, on, tea, but, also, on, opium, if, the, main, chinese, demand, had, continued, to, be, for, indian, raw, cotton, or, at, any, rate, if, there, had, been, no, market, for, opium, in, late, ch, ing, china, as, there, had, been, none, earlier, then, there, would, have, been, no, opium, war, yet, probably, some, kind, of, sino, foreign, war, would, have, come, given, the, irresistible, vigor, of, western, expansion, and, immovable, inertia, of, chinese, institutions, some, historians, claim, that, lord, palmerston, the, british, foreign, secretary, initiated, the, opium, war, to, maintain, the, principle, of, free, trade, professor, glenn, melancon, for, example, argues, that, the, issue, in, going, to, war, was, not, opium, but, britain, s, need, to, uphold, its, reputation, its, honour, and, its, commitment, to, global, free, trade, china, was, pressing, britain, just, when, the, british, faced, serious, pressures, in, the, near, east, on, the, indian, frontier, and, in, latin, america, in, the, end, says, melancon, the, government, s, need, to, maintain, its, honour, in, britain, and, prestige, abroad, forced, the, decision, to, go, to, war, former, american, president, john, quincy, adams, commented, that, opium, was, a, mere, incident, to, the, dispute, the, cause, of, the, war, is, the, kowtow, the, arrogant, and, insupportable, pretensions, of, china, that, she, will, hold, commercial, intercourse, with, the, rest, of, mankind, not, upon, terms, of, equal, reciprocity, but, upon, the, insulting, and, degrading, forms, of, the, relations, between, lord, and, vassal, the, australian, historian, harry, g, gelber, argues, that, opium, played, a, role, similar, to, the, tea, dumped, into, the, harbour, in, the, boston, tea, party, of, 1773, leading, to, the, american, revolutionary, war, gelber, argues, instead, the, british, went, to, war, because, of, chinese, military, threats, to, defenceless, british, civilians, including, women, and, children, because, china, refused, to, negotiate, on, terms, of, diplomatic, equality, and, because, china, refused, to, open, more, ports, than, guangzhou, to, trade, not, just, with, britain, but, with, everybody, the, belief, about, british, guilt, came, later, as, part, of, china, s, long, catalogue, of, alleged, western, exploitation, and, aggression, western, women, were, actually, not, legally, permitted, to, enter, guangzhou, although, they, were, permitted, to, live, in, macau, the, qing, government, hampered, foreign, trade, and, through, the, canton, system, concentrated, trade, in, guangzhou, that, being, said, the, policy, of, concentrating, trade, to, a, single, port, was, also, used, in, western, countries, such, as, spain, and, portugal, western, merchants, could, also, trade, freely, and, legally, with, chinese, merchants, in, xiamen, and, macao, or, when, the, trade, was, conducted, through, ports, outside, china, such, as, manila, and, batavia, furthermore, macao, was, restricted, to, portuguese, traders, and, xiamen, the, spanish, who, rarely, made, use, of, this, privilege, the, public, in, western, countries, had, earlier, condemned, the, british, government, for, supporting, the, opium, trade, opium, was, the, most, profitable, single, commodity, trade, of, the, 19th, century, as, timothy, brook, and, bob, wakabayashi, write, of, opium, the, british, empire, could, not, survive, were, it, deprived, of, its, most, important, source, of, capital, the, substance, that, could, turn, any, other, commodity, into, silver, although, this, thesis, is, controversial, opium, was, the, most, common, and, the, most, profitable, trade, good, and, comprised, 33, 54, of, all, goods, shipped, from, bengal, to, the, east, between, 1815, and, 1818, carl, trocki, described, the, british, empire, east, of, suez, as, of, 1800, as, essentially, a, drug, cartel, james, bradley, stated, opium, accounted, for, 15, to, 20, percent, of, the, british, empire, s, revenue, and, between, 1814, and, 1850, removed, 11, percent, of, china, s, money, supply, although, shipping, was, regulated, the, qianlong, emperor, s, administration, was, diligent, in, accommodating, the, requisites, of, western, merchants, it, hired, a, growing, body, of, western, assistants, for, the, customs, office, to, help, manage, its, fellow, countrymen, the, order, to, stay, in, macao, during, the, winter, was, lifted, tax, was, exempted, on, food, drink, and, basic, supplies, for, western, merchants, and, protections, were, granted, to, westerners, and, their, property, qing, laws, prevented, chinese, from, pursuing, foreigners, through, the, courts, the, prohibition, mainly, dated, from, the, qianlong, emperor, s, strong, conviction, that, mistreatment, of, foreigners, had, been, a, major, cause, of, the, overthrow, of, several, earlier, dynasties, the, qianlong, emperor, granted, lord, macartney, a, golden, sceptre, an, important, symbol, of, peace, and, wealth, but, that, was, dismissed, by, the, british, who, were, unaware, of, its, symbolism, the, qianlong, emperor, also, dismissed, the, lavish, presents, that, the, british, gave, to, facilitate, diplomatic, relations, and, concluded, that, they, were, no, better, than, other, european, products, in, 1806, chinese, officials, compromised, with, the, british, on, the, murder, of, a, chinese, man, by, british, seamen, as, westerners, refused, to, be, punished, under, chinese, law, and, local, citizens, vigorously, protested, for, xenophobic, reasons, and, because, of, perceived, injustice, in, 1816, the, jiaqing, emperor, dismissed, a, british, embassy, for, its, refusal, to, kowtow, but, he, sent, them, an, apologetic, letter, with, gifts, which, were, later, found, in, the, foreign, office, unread, the, british, ignored, chinese, laws, and, warnings, not, to, deploy, military, forces, in, chinese, waters, the, british, landed, troops, in, macao, despite, a, chinese, and, portuguese, agreement, to, bar, foreign, forces, from, macao, and, then, in, the, war, of, 1812, attacked, american, ships, deep, in, the, inner, harbour, of, guangzhou, the, americans, had, previously, robbed, british, ships, in, chinese, waters, as, well, those, in, combination, with, the, british, support, to, nepal, during, their, invasion, of, tibet, and, later, british, invasion, of, nepal, after, it, became, a, chinese, tributary, state, led, the, chinese, authorities, to, become, highly, suspicious, of, british, intentions, in, 1834, when, british, naval, vessels, intruded, into, chinese, waters, again, the, daoguang, emperor, commented, how, laughable, and, deplorable, is, it, that, we, cannot, even, repel, two, barbarian, ships, our, military, had, decayed, so, much, no, wonder, the, barbarians, are, looking, down, on, us, historians, have, often, pondered, whether, the, war, could, have, been, avoided, one, factor, was, that, china, rejected, diplomatic, relations, with, the, british, or, anyone, else, as, seen, in, the, rejection, of, the, macartney, mission, in, 1793, as, a, result, diplomatic, mechanisms, for, negotiation, and, resolution, were, missing, michael, greenberg, locates, the, inevitable, cause, in, the, momentum, for, more, and, more, overseas, trade, in, britain, s, expanding, modern, economy, on, the, other, hand, the, economic, forces, inside, britain, that, were, war, hawks, radicals, in, parliament, and, northern, merchants, and, manufacturers, were, a, political, minority, and, needed, allies, especially, palmerston, before, they, could, get, their, war, in, parliament, the, melbourne, government, faced, a, host, of, complex, international, threats, including, the, chartist, riots, at, home, bothersome, budget, deficits, unrest, in, ireland, rebellions, in, canada, and, jamaica, war, in, afghanistan, and, french, threats, to, british, business, interests, in, mexico, and, argentina, the, opposition, demanded, more, aggressive, answers, and, it, was, foreign, minister, palmerston, who, set, up, an, easy, war, to, solve, the, political, crisis, it, was, not, economics, opium, sales, or, expanding, trade, that, caused, the, british, to, go, to, war, melancon, argues, but, it, was, more, a, matter, of, upholding, aristocratic, standards, of, national, honour, sullied, by, chinese, insults, one, historiographical, problem, is, that, the, emphasis, on, the, british, causal, factors, tends, to, ignore, the, chinese, the, manchu, rulers, were, focused, on, internal, unrest, by, chinese, elements, and, paid, little, attention, to, the, minor, issues, happening, in, guangzhou, the, historian, james, polachek, argues, the, reasons, for, trying, to, suppress, the, opium, trade, had, to, do, with, internal, factionalism, led, by, a, purification, oriented, group, of, literary, scholars, who, paid, no, attention, to, the, risk, of, international, intervention, by, much, more, powerful, military, forces, therefore, it, was, not, a, matter, of, inevitable, conflict, between, contrasting, worldviews, lin, and, the, daoguang, emperor, comments, spence, seemed, to, have, believed, that, the, citizens, of, guangzhou, and, the, foreign, traders, there, had, simple, childlike, natures, that, would, respond, to, firm, guidance, and, statements, of, moral, principles, set, out, in, simple, clear, terms, neither, considered, the, possibility, that, the, british, government, would, be, committed, to, protecting, the, smugglers, polachek, argues, based, on, records, of, court, debate, that, growing, court, awareness, that, opium, addiction, in, the, guangdong, military, garrisons, caused, by, widespread, collusion, between, british, smugglers, chinese, smugglers, and, chinese, officials, had, completely, impaired, their, military, effectiveness, that, left, the, entire, southern, flank, of, the, qing, exposed, to, military, threats, and, was, more, important, in, generating, opposition, to, the, drug, trade, than, economic, reasons, polachek, shows, that, lin, zexu, and, the, hardliners, mistakenly, believed, that, by, arresting, drug, abusers, confiscating, the, opium, supplies, and, promising, to, allow, the, british, to, continue, trading, in, other, goods, they, could, persuade, the, british, to, give, up, the, drug, trade, without, a, war
