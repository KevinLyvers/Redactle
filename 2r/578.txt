the, soviet, zone, on, 7, october, 1949, it, de, jure, did, not, include, east, berlin, occupied, by, the, soviets, although, the, city, was, de, facto, its, capital, the, high, ideological, conflict, between, german, politicians, and, sociologists, in, their, self, governing, east, west, society, was, preceded, by, the, influence, of, higher, foreign, occupiers, however, this, only, really, rose, to, become, official, with, the, birth, of, the, two, countries, of, germany, in, the, context, of, the, international, tension, s, period, of, the, cold, war, the, capital, of, west, germany, was, in, bonn, however, it, was, only, considered, provisional, due, to, the, west, german, target, of, berlin, which, had, been, divided, with, the, eastern, part, de, facto, managed, by, east, germany, east, germany, originally, also, wanted, to, gain, west, berlin, and, make, the, unified, berlin, become, its, capital, the, western, allies, and, west, germany, rejected, the, soviet, union, s, idea, of, neutral, reunification, in, 1952, resulting, in, the, two, german, governments, continuing, to, exist, side, by, side, most, of, the, border, between, two, germanies, and, later, border, in, berlin, was, physically, fortified, and, tightly, controlled, by, east, germany, in, 1952, and, 1961, respectively, the, flags, of, the, two, german, countries, were, originally, the, same, but, in, 1959, east, germany, changed, its, flag, the, west, german, government, initially, did, not, recognize, the, new, and, de, facto, german, polish, border, nor, east, germany, but, later, eventually, recognized, the, border, in, 1972, with, the, 1970, treaty, of, warsaw, and, east, germany, in, 1973, with, the, 1972, basic, treaty, when, applying, a, common, policy, to, reconcile, with, the, communist, countries, in, the, east, the, east, german, government, also, had, encouraged, two, state, status, after, initially, denying, the, existence, of, the, west, german, state, with, the, influence, from, the, soviet, policy, of, peaceful, coexistence, the, mutual, recognition, of, the, two, germanies, paved, the, way, for, both, countries, to, be, widely, recognized, internationally, the, two, germanies, joined, the, united, nations, as, two, separate, country, members, in, 1973, and, east, germany, abandoned, its, goal, of, reunification, with, their, compatriots, in, the, west, in, a, constitutional, amendment, the, following, year, the, principle, is, written, in, our, constitution, that, no, one, has, the, right, to, give, up, a, policy, whose, goal, is, the, eventual, reunification, of, germany, but, in, a, realistic, view, of, the, world, this, is, a, goal, that, could, take, generations, beyond, my, own, to, achieve, mikhail, gorbachev, had, led, the, country, as, general, secretary, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, since, 1985, with, the, fact, that, the, soviet, union, experienced, a, period, of, economic, and, political, stagnation, and, correspondingly, decreased, intervention, in, eastern, bloc, politics, in, 1987, the, united, states, president, ronald, reagan, gave, a, famous, speech, at, the, brandenburg, gate, challenging, soviet, general, secretary, mikhail, gorbachev, to, tear, down, this, wall, which, prevent, freedom, of, movement, in, berlin, the, wall, had, stood, as, an, icon, for, the, political, and, economic, division, between, east, and, west, a, division, that, churchill, had, referred, to, as, the, iron, curtain, gorbachev, announced, in, 1988, that, the, soviet, union, would, abandon, the, brezhnev, doctrine, and, allow, the, eastern, european, countries, to, freely, determine, their, own, internal, affairs, in, early, 1989, under, a, new, era, of, soviet, policies, of, glasnost, openness, and, perestroika, economic, restructuring, and, taken, further, by, gorbachev, the, solidarity, movement, took, hold, in, poland, further, inspired, by, other, images, of, brave, defiance, a, wave, of, revolutions, swept, throughout, the, eastern, bloc, that, year, in, may, 1989, hungary, removed, their, border, fence, however, the, dismantling, of, the, old, hungarian, border, facilities, did, not, open, the, borders, nor, were, the, previous, strict, controls, removed, and, the, isolation, by, the, iron, curtain, was, still, intact, over, its, entire, length, the, opening, of, a, border, gate, between, austria, and, hungary, at, the, pan, european, picnic, on, 19, august, 1989, then, set, in, motion, a, peaceful, chain, reaction, at, the, end, of, which, there, was, no, longer, a, gdr, and, the, eastern, bloc, had, disintegrated, extensive, advertising, for, the, planned, picnic, was, made, by, posters, and, flyers, among, the, gdr, holidaymakers, in, hungary, the, austrian, branch, of, the, paneuropean, union, which, was, then, headed, by, karl, von, habsburg, distributed, thousands, of, brochures, inviting, them, to, a, picnic, near, the, border, at, sopron, it, was, the, largest, escape, movement, from, east, germany, since, the, berlin, wall, was, built, in, 1961, after, the, picnic, which, was, based, on, an, idea, by, karl, s, father, otto, von, habsburg, to, test, the, reaction, of, the, ussr, and, mikhail, gorbachev, to, an, opening, of, the, border, tens, of, thousands, of, media, informed, east, germans, set, off, for, hungary, the, media, reaction, of, erich, honecker, in, the, daily, mirror, of, 19, august, 1989, showed, the, public, in, east, and, west, that, there, had, been, a, loss, of, power, by, the, eastern, european, communist, rulers, in, their, own, sphere, of, power, and, that, they, were, no, longer, the, designers, of, what, was, happening, habsburg, distributed, leaflets, far, into, poland, on, which, the, east, german, holiday, makers, were, invited, to, a, picnic, when, they, came, to, the, picnic, they, were, given, gifts, food, and, deutsche, mark, and, then, they, were, persuaded, to, come, to, the, west, in, particular, it, was, examined, by, habsburg, and, the, hungarian, minister, of, state, imre, pozsgay, whether, moscow, would, give, the, soviet, troops, stationed, in, hungary, the, command, to, intervene, but, with, the, mass, exodus, at, the, pan, european, picnic, the, subsequent, hesitant, behavior, of, the, socialist, unity, party, of, east, germany, and, the, nonintervention, of, the, soviet, union, broke, the, dams, thus, the, bracket, of, the, eastern, bloc, was, broken, tens, of, thousands, of, the, media, informed, east, germans, now, made, their, way, to, hungary, which, was, no, longer, ready, to, keep, its, borders, completely, closed, or, to, oblige, its, border, troops, to, use, force, of, arms, by, the, end, of, september, 1989, more, than, 30, 000, east, german, citizens, had, escaped, to, the, west, before, the, gdr, denied, travel, to, hungary, leaving, czechoslovakia, as, the, only, neighboring, state, to, which, east, germans, could, escape, even, then, many, people, within, and, outside, germany, still, believed, that, real, reunification, between, the, two, countries, would, never, happen, in, the, foreseeable, future, the, turning, point, in, germany, called, die, wende, was, marked, by, the, peaceful, revolution, leading, to, the, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, at, the, night, of, 9, november, 1989, with, east, and, west, germany, subsequently, entering, into, negotiations, toward, eliminating, the, division, that, had, been, imposed, upon, germans, more, than, four, decades, earlier, on, 28, november, 1989, two, weeks, after, the, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, west, german, chancellor, helmut, kohl, announced, a, 10, point, program, calling, for, the, two, germanies, to, expand, their, cooperation, with, a, view, toward, eventual, reunification, initially, no, timetable, was, proposed, however, events, rapidly, came, to, a, head, in, early, 1990, first, in, march, the, party, of, democratic, socialism, the, former, socialist, unity, party, of, germany, was, heavily, defeated, in, east, germany, s, first, free, elections, a, grand, coalition, was, formed, under, lothar, de, maizi, re, leader, of, the, east, german, wing, of, kohl, s, christian, democratic, union, on, a, platform, of, speedy, reunification, second, east, germany, s, economy, and, infrastructure, underwent, a, swift, and, near, total, collapse, although, east, germany, was, long, reckoned, as, having, the, most, robust, economy, in, the, soviet, bloc, the, removal, of, communist, hegemony, revealed, the, ramshackle, foundations, of, that, system, the, east, german, mark, had, been, almost, worthless, outside, east, germany, for, some, time, before, the, events, of, 1989, 1990, and, the, collapse, of, the, east, german, economy, further, magnified, the, problem, discussions, immediately, began, on, an, emergency, merger, of, the, german, economies, on, 18, may, 1990, the, two, german, states, signed, a, treaty, agreeing, on, monetary, economic, and,

east, germans, and, was, considered, stable, while, the, gdr, transferred, its, financial, policy, sovereignty, to, west, germany, the, west, started, granting, subsidies, for, the, gdr, budget, and, social, security, system, at, the, same, time, many, west, german, laws, came, into, force, in, the, gdr, this, created, a, suitable, framework, for, a, political, union, by, diminishing, the, huge, gap, between, the, two, existing, political, social, and, economic, systems, the, volkskammer, the, parliament, of, east, germany, passed, a, resolution, on, 23, august, 1990, declaring, the,

document, s, then, existing, article, 23, any, new, prospective, l, nder, could, adhere, to, the, basic, law, by, a, simple, majority, vote, the, initial, 11, joining, states, of, 1949, constituted, the, trizone, west, berlin, had, been, proposed, as, the, 12th, state, but, this, was, legally, inhibited, by, allied, objections, since, berlin, as, a, whole, was, legally, a, quadripartite, occupied, area, despite, this, west, berlin, s, political, affiliation, was, with, west, germany, and, in, many, fields, it, functioned, de, facto, as, if, it, were, a, component, state, of, west, germany, on, 1, january, 1957, before, the, reunification, the, territory, of, saarland, a, protectorate, of, france, 1947, 1956, united, with, west, germany, and, thus, rejoined, germany, as, the, 11th, state, of, the, federal, republic, this, was, called, little, reunification, although, the, saar, protectorate, itself, was, only, one, disputed, territory, as, its, existence, was, opposed, by, the, soviet, union, the, other, option, was, set, out, in, article, 146, which, provided, a, mechanism, for, a, permanent, constitution, for, a, reunified, germany, this, route, would, have, entailed, a, formal, union, between, two, german, states, that, then, would, have, had, among, other, things, to, create, a, new, constitution, for, the, newly, established, country, however, by, the, spring, of, 1990, it, was, apparent, that, drafting, a, new, constitution, would, require, protracted, negotiations, that, would, open, up, numerous, issues, in, west, germany, even, without, this, to, consider, by, the, start, of, 1990, east, germany, was, in, a, state, of, economic, and, political, collapse, in, contrast, reunification, under, article, 23, could, be, implemented, in, as, little, as, six, months, ultimately, when, the, treaty, on, monetary, economic, and, social, union, was, signed, it, was, decided, to, use, the, quicker, process, of, article, 23, by, this, process, east, germany, voted, to, dissolve, itself, and, to, join, west, germany, and, the, area, in, which, the, basic, law, was, in, force, was, simply, extended, to, include, its, constituent, parts, thus, while, legally, east, germany, as, a, whole, acceded, to, the, federal, republic, the, constituent, parts, of, east, germany, entered, into, the, federal, republic, as, five, new, states, which, held, their, first, elections, on, 14, october, 1990, nevertheless, although, the, volkskammer, s, declaration, of, accession, to, the, federal, republic, had, initiated, the, process, of, reunification, the, act, of, reunification, itself, with, its, many, specific, terms, conditions, and, qualifications, some, of, which, required, amendments, to, the, basic, law, itself, was, achieved, constitutionally, by, the, subsequent, unification, treaty, of, 31, august, 1990, that, is, through, a, binding, agreement, between, the, former, gdr, and, the, federal, republic, now, recognizing, each, another, as, separate, sovereign, states, in, international, law, this, treaty, was, then, voted, into, effect, by, both, the, volkskammer, and, the, bundestag, by, the, constitutionally, required, two, thirds, majorities, effecting, on, the, one, hand, the, extinction, of, the, gdr, and, on, the, other, the, agreed, amendments, to, the, basic, law, of, the, federal, republic, hence, although, the, gdr, declared, its, accession, to, the, federal, republic, under, article, 23, of, the, basic, law, this, did, not, imply, its, acceptance, of, the, basic, law, as, it, then, stood, but, rather, of, the, basic, law, as, subsequently, amended, in, line, with, the, unification, treaty, legally, the, reunification, did, not, create, a, third, state, out, of, the, two, rather, west, germany, effectively, absorbed, east, germany, accordingly, on, unification, day, 3, october, 1990, the, german, democratic, republic, ceased, to, exist, and, five, new, federated, states, on, its, former, territory, joined, the, federal, republic, of, germany, east, and, west, berlin, were, reunited, as, the, third, full, fledged, federated, city, state, of, the, enlarged, federal, republic, the, reunited, city, became, the, capital, of, the, enlarged, federal, republic, under, this, model, the, federal, republic, of, germany, now, enlarged, to, include, the, five, states, of, the, former, gdr, plus, the, reunified, berlin, continued, to, exist, under, the, same, legal, personality, that, was, founded, in, may, 1949, while, the, basic, law, was, modified, rather, than, replaced, by, a, constitution, as, such, it, still, permits, the, adoption, of, a, formal, constitution, by, the, german, people, at, some, time, in, the, future, in, the, context, of, urban, planning, in, addition, to, a, wealth, of, new, opportunity, and, the, symbolism, of, two, former, independent, states, being, rejoined, the, reunification, of, berlin, presented, numerous, challenges, the, city, underwent, massive, redevelopment, involving, the, political, economic, and, cultural, environment, of, both, east, and, west, berlin, however, the, scar, left, by, the, wall, which, ran, directly, through, the, very, heart, of, the, city, had, consequences, for, the, urban, environment, that, planning, still, needs, to, address, the, unification, of, berlin, presented, legal, political, and, technical, challenges, for, the, urban, environment, the, political, division, and, physical, separation, of, the, city, for, more, than, 30, years, saw, the, east, and, the, west, develop, their, own, distinct, urban, forms, with, many, of, these, differences, still, visible, to, this, day, as, urban, planning, in, germany, is, the, responsibility, of, the, city, government, the, integration, of, east, and, west, berlin, was, in, part, complicated, by, the, fact, that, the, existing, planning, frameworks, became, obsolete, with, the, fall, of, the, wall, prior, to, the, reunification, of, the, city, the, land, use, plan, of, 1988, and, general, development, plan, of, 1980, defined, the, spatial, planning, criteria, for, west, and, east, berlin, respectively, these, were, replaced, by, the, new, unified, land, use, plan, in, 1994, termed, critical, reconstruction, the, new, policy, aimed, to, revive, berlin, s, prewar, aesthetic, it, was, complemented, by, a, strategic, planning, document, for, downtown, berlin, entitled, inner, city, planning, framework, following, the, dissolution, of, the, gdr, on, 3, october, 1990, all, planning, projects, under, the, socialist, totalitarian, regime, were, abandoned, vacant, lots, open, areas, and, empty, fields, in, east, berlin, were, subject, to, redevelopment, in, addition, to, space, previously, occupied, by, the, wall, and, associated, buffer, zone, many, of, these, sites, were, positioned, in, central, strategic, locations, of, the, reunified, city, to, commemorate, the, day, that, marks, the, official, unification, of, the, former, east, and, west, germany, in, 1990, 3, october, has, since, then, been, the, official, national, holiday, of, germany, the, day, of, german, unity, tag, der, deutschen, einheit, it, replaced, the, previous, national, holiday, held, in, west, germany, on, 17, june, commemorating, the, east, german, uprising, of, 1953, and, the, national, holiday, on, 7, october, in, the, gdr, that, commemorated, the, foundation, of, the, east, german, state, an, alternative, date, to, commemorate, the, reunification, could, have, been, the, day, the, berlin, wall, came, down, 9, november, 1989, which, coincided, with, the, anniversary, of, the, proclamation, of, the, german, republic, in, 1918, and, the, defeat, of, hitler, s, first, coup, in, 1923, however, 9, november, was, also, the, anniversary, of, the, first, large, scale, nazi, led, pogroms, against, jews, in, 1938, kristallnacht, so, the, day, was, considered, inappropriate, for, a, national, holiday, throughout, the, entire, cold, war, and, until, 1990, reunification, did, not, appear, likely, and, the, existence, of, two, german, countries, was, commonly, regarded, as, an, established, unalterable, fact, helmut, kohl, briefly, addressed, this, issue, during, the, 1983, west, german, federal, election, stating, that, despite, his, belief, in, german, national, unity, it, would, not, mean, a, return, to, the, nation, state, of, earlier, times, in, the, 1980s, opposition, to, a, united, german, country, and, support, for, lasting, peaceful, coexistence, between, the, two, german, countries, were, very, common, amongst, left, wing, parties, of, west, germany, especially, the, spd, and, greens, the, division, of, germany, was, considered, necessary, to, maintain, peace, in, europe, and, the, emergence, of, another, german, state, was, also, seen, as, possibly, dangerous, to, the, west, german, democracy, a, german, publicist, peter, bender, wrote, in, 1981, considering, the, role, germany, played, in, the, origins, of, both, world, wars, europe, cannot, and, the, germans, should, not, want, a, new, german, reich, a, sovereign, nation, state, that, is, the, logic, of, history, which, is, as, bismarck, noted, more, exact, than, the, prussian, government, audit, office, opinion, on, reunification, was, not, only, highly, partisan, but, polarised, along, many, social, divides, germans, aged, 35, or, younger, were, opposed, to, unification, whereas, older, respondents, were, more, supportive, likewise, low, income, germans, tended, to, oppose, reunification, whereas, more, affluent, responders, were, likely, to, support, it, ultimately, a, poll, in, july, 1990, found, that, the, main, motivation, for, reunification, was, economic, concern, rather, than, nationalism, opinion, polls, in, the, late, 1980s, showed, that, young, east, germans, and, west, germans, saw, each, other, as, foreign, and, did, not, regard, themselves, as, a, single, nation, heinrich, august, winkler, observes, that, an, evaluation, of, the, corresponding, data, in, the, deutschland, archiv, in, 1989, showed, that, the, gdr, was, perceived, by, a, large, portion, of, the, younger, generation, as, a, foreign, nation, with, a, different, social, order, which, was, no, longer, a, part, of, germany, winkler, argues, that, the, reunification, was, not, a, product, of, popular, opinion, but, rather, crisis, management, on, the, highest, level, support, for, unified, germany, fell, once, the, prospect, of, it, became, a, tangible, reality, in, the, fall, of, 1989, a, december, 1989, poll, by, der, spiegel, indicated, strong, support, for, preserving, east, germany, as, a, separate, state, however, sed, members, were, overrepresented, amongst, the, responders, constituting, 13, of, the, population, but, 23, of, those, polled, reporting, on, a, student, protest, in, east, berlin, on, 4, november, 1989, elizabeth, pond, noted, that, virtually, none, of, the, demonstrators, interviewed, by, western, reporters, said, they, wanted, unification, with, the, federal, republic, in, west, germany, once, it, became, clear, that, a, course, of, quick, unification, was, negotiated, the, public, responded, with, concern, in, february, 1990, two, thirds, of, west, germans, considered, the, pace, of, unification, as, too, fast, west, germans, were, also, hostile, towards, the, newcomers, from, the, east, according, to, an, april, 1990, poll, only, 11, of, west, germans, welcomed, the, refugees, from, east, germany, after, unification, the, national, divide, persisted, a, survey, by, the, allensbach, institute, in, april, 1993, found, that, only, 22, of, west, germans, and, 11, of, east, germans, felt, they, were, one, nation, dolores, l, augustine, observed, that, the, sense, of, oneness, felt, by, east, germans, and, west, germans, in, the, euphoric, period, after, the, fall, of, the, wall, proved, all, too, transitory, as, the, old, divisions, persisted, and, germans, not, only, still, saw, themselves, as, two, separate, people, but, also, acted, in, accordance, with, their, separate, regional, interests, this, state, of, mind, became, known, as, mauer, im, kopf, wall, in, the, head, suggesting, that, despite, the, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, a, psychological, wall, still, existed, between, east, and, west, germans, augustine, argues, that, despite, resistance, to, the, political, regime, of, east, germany, it, still, represented, the, history, and, identity, of, east, germans, unification, caused, backlash, and, the, treuhandanstalt, an, agency, created, to, carry, out, privatization, was, blamed, for, creating, mass, unemployment, and, poverty, in, the, east, an, influential, part, of, the, reunification, opponents, were, the, so, called, anti, germans, emerging, from, the, student, left, anti, germans, were, supportive, of, israel, and, strongly, opposed, german, nationalism, arguing, that, an, emergence, of, a, united, german, state, would, also, result, in, a, return, of, fascism, nazism, they, considered, the, social, and, political, dynamics, of, 1980s, and, 1990s, germany, to, be, comparable, to, those, of, the, 1930s, denouncing, the, emerging, anti, zionism, unification, sentiments, and, reemergence, of, pan, germanism, hermann, l, gremliza, who, left, the, spd, in, 1989, because, of, its, support, for, german, unification, was, repulsed, by, the, universal, support, for, unification, amongst, most, major, parties, stating, that, it, reminded, him, of, social, democrats, joining, the, national, socialists, nazis, in, singing, the, german, national, anthem, in, 1933, following, hitler, s, declaration, of, his, foreign, policy, several, thousand, people, joined, the, anti, germans, 1990, protests, against, german, reunification, according, to, stephen, brockmann, german, reunification, was, feared, and, opposed, by, ethnic, minorities, particularly, those, of, east, germany, he, observes, that, right, wing, violence, was, on, the, rise, throughout, 1990, in, the, gdr, with, frequent, instances, of, beatings, rapes, and, fights, connected, with, xenophobia, which, led, to, a, police, lockdown, in, leipzig, on, the, night, of, reunification, tensions, with, poland, were, high, and, many, internal, ethnic, minorities, such, as, the, sorbs, feared, further, displacement, or, assimilationist, policies, the, sorbs, had, received, legal, protection, in, the, gdr, and, feared, that, the, rights, granted, to, them, in, east, germany, would, not, be, included, in, the, law, of, an, eventual, united, germany, ultimately, no, provision, on, the, protection, of, ethnic, minorities, was, included, in, the, post, unification, reform, of, the, basic, law, in, 1994, while, politicians, called, for, acceptance, of, a, new, multiethnic, society, many, were, unwilling, to, give, up, its, traditional, racial, definition, of, german, nationality, feminist, groups, also, opposed, the, unification, as, abortion, laws, were, less, restrictive, in, east, germany, than, in, west, germany, and, the, progress, that, the, gdr, had, made, in, regard, to, women, s, welfare, such, as, legal, equality, child, care, and, financial, support, were, all, less, impressive, or, non, existent, in, the, west, opposition, was, also, prevalent, amongst, jewish, circles, who, had, special, status, and, rights, in, east, germany, some, jewish, intellectuals, such, as, g, nter, kunert, expressed, concern, of, jews, being, portrayed, as, part, of, the, east, german, socialist, elites, given, that, the, jews, had, unique, rights, such, as, being, allowed, to, travel, west, there, was, also, a, significant, opposition, to, the, unification, in, intellectual, circles, christa, wolf, and, manfred, stolpe, stressed, the, need, to, forge, an, east, german, identity, while, citizens, initiatives, church, groups, and, intellectuals, of, the, first, hour, began, issuing, dire, warnings, about, a, possible, anschluss, of, the, gdr, by, the, federal, republic, many, east, german, oppositionists, and, reformers, advocated, for, a, third, path, of, an, independent, democratic, socialist, east, germany, stefan, heym, argued, that, the, preservation, of, the, gdr, was, necessary, to, achieve, the, ideal, of, democratic, socialism, urging, east, germans, to, oppose, capitalist, annexation, in, favour, of, a, democratic, socialist, society, writers, in, both, east, and, west, were, concerned, about, the, destruction, of, the, east, german, or, west, german, cultural, identity, respectively, in, goodbye, to, the, literature, of, the, federal, republic, frank, schirrmacher, states, that, the, literature, of, both, states, had, been, central, to, the, consciousness, and, unique, identity, of, both, nations, with, this, newly, developed, culture, being, now, endangered, by, looming, reunification, david, gress, remarked, that, there, was, an, influential, view, found, largely, but, by, no, means, only, on, the, german, and, international, left, which, saw, the, drive, for, unification, as, either, sinister, masking, a, revival, of, aggressive, nationalist, aspirations, or, materialist, g, nter, grass, who, won, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, in, 1999, also, expressed, his, vehement, opposition, to, the, unification, of, germany, citing, his, tragic, memories, of, world, war, ii, as, the, reason, according, to, grass, the, emergence, of, national, socialism, and, the, holocaust, had, deprived, germany, of, its, right, to, exist, as, a, unified, nation, state, he, wrote, historical, responsibility, dictates, opposition, to, reunification, no, matter, how, inevitable, it, may, seem, he, also, claimed, that, national, victory, threatens, a, cultural, defeat, as, blooming, of, german, culture, and, philosophy, is, possible, only, at, times, of, fruitful, national, disunity, and, also, cited, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, s, opposition, to, the, first, unification, of, germany, in, 1871, goethe, wrote, frankfurt, bremen, hamburg, l, beck, are, large, and, brilliant, and, their, impact, on, the, prosperity, of, germany, is, incalculable, yet, would, they, remain, what, they, are, if, they, were, to, lose, their, independence, and, be, incorporated, as, provincial, cities, into, one, great, german, empire, i, have, reason, to, doubt, this, grass, also, condemned, the, unification, as, philistinist, and, purely, materialist, calling, it, the, monetary, fetish, by, now, devoid, of, all, joy, heiner, m, ller, supported, grass, criticism, of, the, unification, process, warning, east, germans, we, will, be, a, nation, without, dreams, we, will, lose, our, memories, our, past, and, therefore, also, our, ability, to, hope, british, historian, richard, j, evans, made, a, similar, argument, criticizing, the, unification, as, driven, solely, by, consumerist, appetites, whetted, by, years, of, watching, west, german, television, advertisements, for, decades, west, germany, s, allies, stated, their, support, for, reunification, israeli, prime, minister, yitzhak, shamir, who, speculated, that, a, country, that, decided, to, kill, millions, of, jewish, people, in, the, holocaust, will, try, to, do, it, again, was, one, of, the, few, world, leaders, to, publicly, oppose, it, as, reunification, became, a, realistic, possibility, however, significant, nato, and, european, opposition, emerged, in, private, a, poll, of, four, countries, in, january, 1990, found, that, a, majority, of, surveyed, americans, and, french, supported, reunification, while, british, and, poles, were, more, divided, 69, percent, of, poles, and, 50, percent, of, french, and, british, stated, that, they, worried, about, a, reunified, germany, becoming, the, dominant, power, in, europe, those, surveyed, stated, several, concerns, including, germany, again, attempting, to, expand, its, territory, a, revival, of, nazism, and, the, german, economy, becoming, too, powerful, while, british, french, and, americans, favored, germany, remaining, a, member, of, nato, a, majority, of, poles, supported, neutrality, for, the, reunified, state, the, key, ally, was, the, united, states, although, some, top, american, officials, opposed, quick, unification, secretary, of, state, james, a, baker, and, president, george, h, w, bush, provided, strong, and, decisive, support, to, kohl, s, proposals, we, defeated, the, germans, twice, and, now, they, re, back, british, prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, was, one, of, the, most, vehement, opponents, of, german, reunification, before, the, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, thatcher, told, soviet, general, secretary, mikhail, gorbachev, that, neither, the, united, kingdom, nor, according, to, her, western, europe, wanted, the, reunification, of, germany, thatcher, also, clarified, that, she, wanted, the, soviet, leader, to, do, what, he, could, to, stop, it, telling, gorbachev, we, do, not, want, a, united, germany, although, she, welcomed, east, german, democracy, thatcher, worried, that, a, rapid, reunification, might, weaken, gorbachev, and, she, favored, soviet, troops, staying, in, east, germany, as, long, as, possible, to, act, as, a, counterweight, to, a, united, germany, thatcher, who, carried, in, her, handbag, a, map, of, germany, s, 1937, borders, to, show, others, the, german, problem, feared, that, germany, s, national, character, size, and, central, location, in, europe, would, cause, it, to, be, a, destabilizing, rather, than, a, stabilizing, force, in, europe, in, december, 1989, she, warned, fellow, european, community, leaders, at, a, council, summit, in, strasbourg, which, kohl, attended, we, defeated, the, germans, twice, and, now, they, re, back, although, thatcher, had, stated, her, support, for, german, self, determination, in, 1985, she, now, argued, that, germany, s, allies, only, supported, reunification, because, they, did, not, believe, it, would, ever, happen, thatcher, favored, a, transition, period, of, five, years, for, reunification, during, which, the, two, germanies, would, remain, separate, states, although, she, gradually, softened, her, opposition, as, late, as, march, 1990, thatcher, summoned, historians, and, diplomats, to, a, seminar, at, chequers, to, ask, how, dangerous, are, the, germans, and, the, french, ambassador, in, london, reported, that, thatcher, told, him, france, and, great, britain, should, pull, together, today, in, the, face, of, the, german, threat, the, pace, of, events, surprised, the, french, whose, foreign, ministry, had, concluded, in, october, 1989, that, reunification, does, not, appear, realistic, at, this, moment, a, representative, of, french, president, fran, ois, mitterrand, reportedly, told, an, aide, to, gorbachev, france, by, no, means, wants, german, reunification, although, it, realises, that, in, the, end, it, is, inevitable, at, the, strasbourg, summit, mitterrand, and, thatcher, discussed, the, fluidity, of, germany, s, historical, borders, on, 20, january, 1990, mitterrand, told, thatcher, that, a, unified, germany, could, make, more, ground, than, even, adolf, had, he, predicted, that, bad, germans, would, reemerge, who, might, seek, to, regain, former, german, territory, lost, after, world, war, ii, and, would, likely, dominate, hungary, poland, and, czechoslovakia, leaving, only, romania, and, bulgaria, for, the, rest, of, us, the, two, leaders, saw, no, way, to, prevent, reunification, however, as, none, of, us, was, going, to, declare, war, on, germany, mitterrand, recognized, before, thatcher, that, reunification, was, inevitable, and, adjusted, his, views, accordingly, unlike, her, he, was, hopeful, that, participation, in, a, single, currency, and, other, european, institutions, could, control, a, united, germany, mitterrand, still, wanted, thatcher, to, publicly, oppose, unification, however, to, obtain, more, concessions, from, germany, i, love, germany, so, much, that, i, prefer, to, see, two, of, them, ireland, s, taoiseach, charles, haughey, supported, german, reunification, and, he, took, advantage, of, ireland, s, presidency, of, the, european, economic, community, to, call, for, an, extraordinary, european, summit, in, dublin, in, april, 1990, to, calm, the, fears, held, of, fellow, members, of, the, eec, haughey, saw, similarities, between, ireland, and, germany, and, said, i, have, expressed, a, personal, view, that, coming, as, we, do, from, a, country, which, is, also, divided, many, of, us, would, have, sympathy, with, any, wish, of, the, people, of, the, two, german, states, for, unification, der, spiegel, later, described, other, european, leaders, opinion, of, reunification, at, the, time, as, icy, italy, s, giulio, andreotti, warned, against, a, revival, of, pan, germanism, and, the, netherlands, s, ruud, lubbers, questioned, the, german, right, to, self, determination, they, shared, britain, s, and, france, s, concerns, over, a, return, to, german, militarism, and, the, economic, power, of, a, reunified, country, the, consensus, opinion, was, that, reunification, if, it, must, occur, should, not, occur, until, at, least, 1995, and, preferably, much, later, andreotti, quoting, fran, ois, mauriac, joked, i, love, germany, so, much, that, i, prefer, to, see, two, of, them, the, victors, of, world, war, ii, france, the, soviet, union, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, comprising, the, four, power, authorities, retained, authority, over, berlin, such, as, control, over, air, travel, and, its, political, status, from, the, onset, the, soviet, union, sought, to, use, reunification, as, a, way, to, push, germany, out, of, nato, into, neutrality, removing, nuclear, weapons, from, its, territory, however, west, germany, misinterpreted, a, 21, november, 1989, diplomatic, message, on, the, topic, to, mean, that, the, soviet, leadership, already, anticipated, reunification, only, two, weeks, after, the, wall, s, collapse, this, belief, and, the, worry, that, his, rival, genscher, might, act, first, encouraged, kohl, on, 28, november, to, announce, a, detailed, ten, point, program, for, overcoming, the, division, of, germany, and, europe, while, his, speech, was, very, popular, within, west, germany, it, caused, concern, among, other, european, governments, with, whom, he, had, not, discussed, the, plan, the, americans, did, not, share, the, europeans, and, soviets, historical, fears, over, german, expansionism, condoleezza, rice, later, recalled, the, united, states, and, president, george, h, w, bush, recognized, that, germany, went, through, a, long, democratic, transition, it, was, a, good, friend, it, was, a, member, of, nato, any, issues, that, existed, in, 1945, it, seemed, perfectly, reasonable, to, lay, them, to, rest, for, us, the, question, wasn, t, should, germany, unify, it, was, how, and, under, what, circumstances, we, had, no, concern, about, a, resurgent, germany, the, united, states, wished, to, ensure, however, that, germany, would, stay, within, nato, in, december, 1989, the, administration, of, president, george, h, w, bush, made, a, united, germany, s, continued, nato, membership, a, requirement, for, supporting, reunification, kohl, agreed, although, less, than, 20, percent, of, west, germans, supported, remaining, within, nato, kohl, also, wished, to, avoid, a, neutral, germany, as, he, believed, that, would, destroy, nato, cause, the, united, states, and, canada, to, leave, europe, and, cause, britain, and, france, to, form, an, anti, german, alliance, the, united, states, increased, its, support, of, kohl, s, policies, as, it, feared, that, otherwise, oskar, lafontaine, a, critic, of, nato, might, become, chancellor, horst, teltschik, kohl, s, foreign, policy, advisor, later, recalled, that, germany, would, have, paid, 100, billion, deutschmarks, if, the, soviets, demanded, it, the, ussr, did, not, make, such, great, demands, however, with, gorbachev, stating, in, february, 1990, that, he, germans, must, decide, for, themselves, what, path, they, choose, to, follow, in, may, 1990, he, repeated, his, remark, in, the, context, of, nato, membership, while, meeting, bush, amazing, both, the, americans, and, germans, this, removed, the, last, significant, roadblock, to, germany, being, free, to, choose, its, international, alignments, though, kohl, made, no, secret, that, he, intended, for, the, reunified, germany, to, inherit, west, germany, s, seats, in, nato, and, the, ec, during, a, nato, warsaw, pact, conference, in, ottawa, canada, genscher, persuaded, the, four, powers, to, treat, the, two, germanies, as, equals, instead, of, defeated, junior, partners, and, for, the, six, nations, to, negotiate, alone, although, the, dutch, italians, spanish, and, other, nato, powers, opposed, such, a, structure, which, meant, that, the, alliance, s, boundaries, would, change, without, their, participation, the, six, nations, began, negotiations, in, march, 1990, after, gorbachev, s, may, agreement, on, german, nato, membership, the, soviets, further, agreed, that, germany, would, be, treated, as, an, ordinary, nato, country, with, the, exception, that, former, east, german, territory, would, not, have, foreign, nato, troops, or, nuclear, weapons, in, exchange, kohl, agreed, to, reduce, the, sizes, of, the, militaries, of, both, west, and, east, germany, renounce, weapons, of, mass, destruction, and, accept, the, postwar, oder, neisse, line, as, germany, s, eastern, border, in, addition, germany, agreed, to, pay, about, 55, billion, deutschmarks, to, the, soviet, union, in, gifts, and, loans, the, equivalent, of, eight, days, of, the, west, german, gdp, to, oppose, german, reunification, the, british, insisted, to, the, end, against, soviet, opposition, that, nato, be, allowed, to, hold, maneuvers, in, the, former, east, germany, thatcher, later, wrote, that, her, opposition, to, reunification, had, been, an, unambiguous, failure, on, 15, march, 1991, the, treaty, on, the, final, settlement, with, respect, to, germany, that, had, been, signed, in, moscow, back, on, 12, september, 1990, by, the, two, german, states, that, then, existed, east, and, west, germany, on, one, side, and, by, the, four, principal, allied, powers, the, united, kingdom, france, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, on, the, other, entered, into, force, having, been, ratified, by, the, federal, republic, of, germany, after, the, unification, as, the, united, germany, and, by, the, four, allied, states, the, entry, into, force, of, that, treaty, also, known, as, the, two, plus, four, treaty, in, reference, to, the, two, german, states, and, four, allied, governments, that, signed, it, put, an, end, to, the, then, remaining, limitations, on, german, sovereignty, and, the, acc, that, resulted, from, the, post, world, war, ii, arrangements, after, the, americans, intervened, both, the, united, kingdom, and, france, ratified, the, treaty, on, the, final, settlement, with, respect, to, germany, in, september, 1990, the, treaty, entered, into, force, on, 15, march, 1991, in, accordance, with, article, 9, of, the, two, plus, four, treaty, it, entered, into, force, as, soon, as, all, ratifications, were, deposited, with, the, government, of, germany, thus, finalizing, the, reunification, for, purposes, of, international, law, the, last, party, to, ratify, the, treaty, was, the, soviet, union, that, deposited, its, instrument, of, ratification, on, 15, march, 1991, the, supreme, soviet, of, the, ussr, only, gave, its, approval, to, the, ratification, of, the, treaty, on, 4, march, 1991, after, a, hefty, debate, even, prior, to, the, ratification, of, the, treaty, the, operation, of, all, quadripartite, allied, institutions, in, germany, was, suspended, with, effect, from, the, reunification, of, germany, on, 3, october, 1990, and, pending, the, final, ratification, of, the, two, plus, four, treaty, pursuant, to, a, declaration, signed, in, new, york, on, 1, october, 1990, by, the, foreign, ministers, of, the, four, allied, powers, that, was, witnessed, by, ministers, of, the, two, german, states, then, in, existence, and, that, was, appended, text, of, the, two, plus, four, treaty, however, the, soviets, cited, their, occupation, rights, for, the, last, time, as, late, as, on, 13, march, 1991, just, two, days, before, the, treaty, became, effective, when, the, honeckers, were, enabled, by, soviet, hardliners, to, flee, germany, on, a, military, jet, to, moscow, from, the, soviet, controlled, sperenberg, airfield, with, the, german, federal, government, being, notified, of, this, in, advance, of, just, one, hour, under, the, treaty, on, final, settlement, which, should, not, be, confused, with, the, unification, treaty, that, was, signed, only, between, the, two, german, states, the, last, allied, forces, still, present, in, germany, left, in, 1994, in, accordance, with, article, 4, of, the, treaty, that, set, 31, december, 1994, as, the, deadline, for, the, withdrawal, of, the, remaining, allied, forces, the, bulk, of, russian, ground, forces, left, germany, on, 25, june, 1994, with, a, military, parade, of, the, 6th, guards, motor, rifle, brigade, in, berlin, this, was, followed, by, the, closure, of, the, united, states, army, berlin, command, on, 12, july, 1994, an, event, that, was, marked, by, a, casing, of, the, colors, ceremony, witnessed, by, president, bill, clinton, the, withdrawal, of, the, last, russian, troops, the, russian, army, s, western, group, of, forces, was, completed, on, 31, august, 1994, and, the, event, was, marked, by, a, military, ceremony, in, the, treptow, park, in, berlin, with, the, presence, of, russian, president, yeltsin, and, german, chancellor, kohl, although, the, bulk, of, the, british, american, and, french, forces, had, left, germany, even, before, the, departure, of, the, russians, the, western, allies, kept, a, presence, in, berlin, until, the, completion, of, the, russian, withdrawal, and, the, ceremony, marking, the, departure, of, the, remaining, forces, of, the, western, allies, was, the, last, to, take, place, on, 8, september, 1994, a, farewell, ceremony, in, the, courtyard, of, the, charlottenburg, palace, with, the, presence, of, british, prime, minister, john, major, american, secretary, of, state, warren, christopher, french, president, fran, ois, mitterrand, and, german, chancellor, helmut, kohl, marked, the, withdrawal, of, the, british, american, and, french, occupation, forces, from, berlin, and, the, termination, of, the, allied, occupation, in, germany, thus, the, removal, of, the, allied, presence, took, place, a, few, months, before, the, final, deadline, article, 5, banned, the, deployment, of, nuclear, weapons, in, the, territory, previously, controlled, by, the, gdr, and, well, as, a, ban, on, stationing, non, german, military, personnel, on, 14, november, 1990, germany, and, poland, signed, the, german, polish, border, treaty, finalizing, germany, s, eastern, boundary, as, permanent, along, the, oder, lusatian, western, neisse, line, and, thus, renouncing, any, claims, to, most, of, silesia, east, brandenburg, farther, pomerania, and, the, southern, area, of, the, former, province, of, east, prussia, they, are, called, the, recovered, territories, by, poland, as, they, were, once, ruled, by, piast, poland, the, following, month, the, first, all, german, free, elections, since, 1932, were, held, resulting, in, an, increased, majority, for, the, coalition, government, of, chancellor, helmut, kohl, as, for, the, german, polish, border, treaty, it, was, approved, by, the, polish, sejm, on, 26, november, 1991, and, the, german, bundestag, on, 16, december, 1991, and, entered, into, force, with, the, exchange, of, the, instruments, of, ratification, on, 16, january, 1992, the, confirmation, of, the, border, between, germany, and, poland, was, required, of, germany, by, the, four, allied, countries, in, the, two, plus, four, treaty, the, treaty, was, later, supplemented, by, the, treaty, of, good, neighbourship, between, the, two, countries, which, took, effect, on, 16, january, 1992, and, ensured, the, few, remaining, germans, in, poland, in, upper, silesia, were, treated, better, by, the, government, the, reunification, made, germany, into, a, great, power, in, the, world, again, the, practical, result, of, the, chosen, legal, model, of, the, unification, the, incorporation, of, the, territory, of, german, democratic, republic, by, the, federal, republic, of, germany, and, the, continuation, of, the, legal, personality, of, the, now, enlarged, federal, republic, is, that, the, expanded, federal, republic, of, germany, inherited, the, old, west, germany, s, seats, at, the, un, nato, the, european, communities, and, other, international, organizations, it, also, continued, to, be, a, party, to, all, the, treaties, the, old, west, germany, signed, prior, to, the, moment, of, reunification, the, basic, law, and, statutory, laws, that, were, in, force, in, the, federal, republic, as, amended, in, accordance, with, the, unification, treaty, continued, automatically, in, force, but, now, applied, to, the, expanded, territory, also, the, same, president, chancellor, prime, minister, and, government, of, the, federal, republic, remained, in, office, but, their, jurisdiction, now, included, the, newly, acquired, territory, of, the, former, east, germany, to, facilitate, this, process, and, to, reassure, other, countries, fundamental, changes, were, made, to, the, german, constitution, the, preamble, and, article, 146, were, amended, and, article, 23, was, replaced, but, the, deleted, former, article, 23, was, applied, as, the, constitutional, model, to, be, used, for, the, 1990, reunification, hence, prior, to, the, five, new, l, nder, of, east, germany, joining, the, basic, law, was, amended, to, indicate, that, all, parts, of, germany, would, then, be, unified, such, that, germany, could, now, no, longer, consider, itself, constitutionally, open, to, further, extension, to, include, the, former, eastern, territories, of, germany, that, were, now, parts, of, poland, and, russia, the, german, territory, the, former, ussr, annexed, was, a, part, of, russia, a, soviet, member, state, and, were, settled, by, poles, and, russians, respectively, the, changes, effectively, formalized, the, oder, neisse, line, as, germany, s, permanent, eastern, border, these, amendments, to, the, basic, law, were, mandated, by, article, i, section, 4, of, the, two, plus, four, treaty, vast, differences, between, former, east, germany, and, west, germany, in, lifestyle, wealth, political, beliefs, and, other, matters, remain, and, it, is, therefore, still, common, to, speak, of, eastern, and, western, germany, distinctly, it, is, often, referred, to, as, the, wall, in, the, head, mauer, im, kopf, ossis, easterners, are, stereotyped, as, racist, poor, and, largely, influenced, by, russian, culture, while, wessis, westerners, are, usually, considered, snobbish, dishonest, wealthy, and, selfish, east, germans, indicate, a, dissatisfaction, with, the, status, quo, and, cultural, alienation, from, the, rest, of, germany, and, a, sense, that, their, cultural, heritage, is, not, acknowledged, enough, in, the, now, unified, germany, the, west, on, the, other, hand, has, become, uninterested, in, what, the, east, has, to, say, and, this, has, led, to, more, resentment, toward, the, east, exacerbating, the, divide, both, the, west, and, the, east, have, failed, to, sustain, an, openminded, dialogue, and, the, failure, to, grasp, the, effects, of, the, institutional, path, dependency, has, increased, the, frustration, each, side, feels, the, economy, of, eastern, germany, has, struggled, since, unification, and, large, subsidies, are, still, transferred, from, west, to, east, economically, eastern, germany, has, had, a, sharp, rise, of, 10, percent, to, west, germany, s, 5, percent, western, germany, also, still, holds, 56, percent, of, the, gdp, part, of, this, disparity, between, the, east, and, the, west, lies, in, the, western, labor, unions, demand, for, high, wage, pacts, in, an, attempt, to, prevent, low, wage, zones, this, caused, many, germans, from, the, east, to, be, outpriced, in, the, market, adding, to, the, slump, in, businesses, in, eastern, germany, as, well, as, the, rising, unemployment, the, former, east, german, area, has, often, been, compared, to, the, underdeveloped, southern, italy, and, the, southern, united, states, during, reconstruction, after, the, american, civil, war, while, the, economy, of, eastern, germany, has, recovered, recently, the, differences, between, east, and, west, remain, present, politicians, and, scholars, have, frequently, called, for, a, process, of, inner, reunification, of, the, two, countries, and, asked, whether, there, is, inner, unification, or, continued, separation, the, process, of, german, unity, has, not, ended, yet, proclaimed, chancellor, angela, merkel, who, grew, up, in, east, germany, in, 2009, nevertheless, the, question, of, this, inner, reunification, has, been, widely, discussed, in, the, german, public, politically, economically, culturally, and, also, constitutionally, since, 1989, politically, since, the, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, the, successor, party, of, the, former, east, german, socialist, state, party, has, become, a, major, force, in, german, politics, it, was, renamed, pds, and, later, merged, with, the, western, leftist, party, wasg, to, form, the, left, party, die, linke, constitutionally, the, basic, law, of, west, germany, grundgesetz, provided, two, pathways, for, unification, the, first, was, the, implementation, of, a, new, all, german, constitution, safeguarded, by, a, popular, referendum, actually, this, was, the, original, idea, of, the, grundgesetz, in, 1949, it, was, named, a, basic, law, instead, of, a, constitution, because, it, was, considered, provisional, the, second, way, was, more, technical, the, implementation, of, the, constitution, in, the, east, using, a, paragraph, originally, designed, for, the, west, german, states, bundesl, nder, in, case, of, internal, reorganization, like, the, merger, of, two, states, while, this, latter, option, was, chosen, as, the, most, feasible, one, the, first, option, was, partly, regarded, as, a, means, to, foster, the, inner, reunification, a, public, manifestation, of, coming, to, terms, with, the, past, vergangenheitsbew, ltigung, is, the, existence, of, the, so, called, birthler, beh, rde, the, federal, commissioner, for, the, stasi, records, which, collects, and, maintains, the, files, of, the, east, german, security, apparatus, the, economic, reconstruction, of, former, east, germany, following, the, reunification, required, large, amounts, of, public, funding, which, turned, some, areas, into, boom, regions, although, overall, unemployment, remains, higher, than, in, the, former, west, unemployment, was, part, of, a, process, of, deindustrialization, starting, rapidly, after, 1990, causes, for, this, process, are, disputed, in, political, conflicts, up, to, the, present, day, most, times, bureaucracy, and, lack, of, efficiency, of, the, east, german, economy, are, highlighted, and, the, deindustrialization, is, seen, as, an, inevitable, outcome, of, the, wende, but, many, critics, from, east, germany, point, out, that, it, was, the, shock, therapy, style, of, privatization, that, did, not, leave, room, for, east, german, enterprises, to, adapt, and, that, alternatives, like, a, slow, transition, had, been, possible, reunification, did, however, lead, to, a, large, rise, in, the, average, standard, of, living, in, former, east, germany, and, a, stagnation, in, the, west, as, 2, trillion, in, public, spending, was, transferred, east, between, 1990, and, 1995, gross, wages, in, the, east, rose, from, 35, percent, to, 74, percent, of, western, levels, while, pensions, rose, from, 40, percent, to, 79, percent, unemployment, reached, double, the, western, level, as, well, west, german, cities, close, to, the, former, border, of, east, and, west, germany, experienced, a, disproportionate, loss, of, market, access, relative, to, other, west, german, cities, which, were, not, as, greatly, affected, by, the, reunification, of, germany, while, the, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, had, broad, economic, political, and, social, impacts, globally, it, also, had, significant, consequence, for, the, local, urban, environment, in, fact, the, events, of, 9, november, 1989, saw, east, berlin, and, west, berlin, two, halves, of, a, single, city, that, had, ignored, one, another, for, the, better, part, of, 40, years, finally, in, confrontation, with, one, another, there, was, a, belief, in, the, city, that, after, 40, years, of, division, the, unified, city, would, be, well, placed, to, become, a, major, metropolis, another, key, priority, was, reestablishing, berlin, as, the, seat, of, government, of, germany, and, this, required, buildings, to, serve, government, needs, including, the, redevelopment, of, sites, for, scores, of, foreign, embassies, with, respect, to, redefining, the, city, s, identity, emphasis, was, placed, on, restoring, berlin, s, traditional, landscape, critical, reconstruction, policies, sought, to, disassociate, the, city, s, identity, from, its, nazi, and, socialist, legacy, though, some, remnants, were, preserved, with, walkways, and, bicycle, paths, established, along, the, border, strip, to, preserve, the, memory, of, the, wall, in, the, center, of, east, berlin, much, of, the, modernist, heritage, of, the, east, german, state, was, gradually, removed, unification, of, berlin, saw, the, removal, of, politically, motivated, street, names, and, monuments, in, the, east, in, an, attempt, to, reduce, the, socialist, legacy, from, the, face, of, east, berlin, immediately, following, the, fall, of, the, wall, berlin, experienced, a, boom, in, the, construction, industry, redevelopment, initiatives, saw, berlin, turn, into, one, of, the, largest, construction, sites, in, the, world, through, the, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, the, fall, of, the, wall, also, had, economic, consequences, two, german, systems, covering, distinctly, divergent, degrees, of, economic, opportunity, suddenly, came, into, intimate, contact, despite, development, of, sites, for, commercial, purposes, berlin, struggled, to, compete, in, economic, terms, with, frankfurt, which, remained, the, financial, capital, of, the, country, as, well, as, with, other, key, west, german, centers, such, as, munich, hamburg, stuttgart, and, d, sseldorf, the, intensive, building, activity, directed, by, planning, policy, resulted, in, the, over, expansion, of, office, space, with, a, high, level, of, vacancies, in, spite, of, the, move, of, most, administrations, and, government, agencies, from, bonn, berlin, was, marred, by, disjointed, economic, restructuring, associated, with, massive, deindustrialisation, economist, oliver, marc, hartwich, asserts, that, while, the, east, undoubtedly, improved, economically, it, was, at, a, much, slower, pace, than, kohl, had, predicted, wealth, and, income, inequality, between, former, east, and, west, germany, continued, for, decades, after, reunification, on, average, adults, in, the, former, west, germany, had, assets, worth, 94, 000, euros, in, 2014, as, compared, to, the, adults, in, the, former, communist, east, germany, which, had, just, over, 40, 000, euros, in, assets, the, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, and, the, factors, described, above, led, to, mass, migration, from, east, berlin, and, east, germany, producing, a, large, labor, supply, shock, in, the, west, emigration, from, the, east, totaling, 870, 000, people, between, 1989, and, 1992, alone, led, to, worse, employment, outcomes, for, the, least, educated, workers, for, blue, collar, workers, for, men, and, for, foreign, nationals, at, the, close, of, the, century, it, became, evident, that, despite, significant, investment, and, planning, berlin, was, unlikely, to, retake, its, seat, between, the, european, global, cities, of, london, and, paris, primarily, due, to, the, fact, that, germany, s, financial, and, commercial, capital, is, located, elsewhere, frankfurt, than, the, administrative, one, berlin, in, resemblance, of, italy, milan, vs, rome, switzerland, z, rich, vs, bern, canada, toronto, vs, ottawa, australia, sydney, vs, canberra, the, us, new, york, city, vs, washington, dc, or, the, netherlands, amsterdam, vs, the, hague, as, opposed, to, london, paris, madrid, vienna, warsaw, or, moscow, which, combine, both, roles, yet, ultimately, the, disparity, between, east, and, west, portions, of, berlin, has, led, to, the, city, achieving, a, new, urban, identity, a, number, of, locales, of, east, berlin, characterized, by, dwellings, of, in, between, use, of, abandoned, space, for, little, to, no, rent, have, become, the, focal, point, and, foundation, of, berlin, s, burgeoning, creative, activities, according, to, berlin, mayor, klaus, wowereit, the, best, that, berlin, has, to, offer, its, unique, creativity, creativity, is, berlin, s, future, overall, the, berlin, government, s, engagement, in, creativity, is, strongly, centered, on, marketing, and, promotional, initiatives, instead, of, creative, production, the, subsequent, economic, restructuring, and, reconstruction, of, eastern, germany, resulted, in, significant, costs, especially, for, western, germany, which, paid, large, sums, of, money, in, the, form, of, the, solidarit, tszuschlag, german, solidarity, surcharge, in, order, to, rebuild, the, east, german, infrastructure, in, addition, the, immensely, advantageous, exchange, rate, of, 1, 1, between, the, west, german, deutschmark, to, the, east, german, mark, meant, that, east, germans, could, trade, in, their, almost, worthless, marks, for, and, receive, wages, in, west, german, currency, this, dealt, a, major, blow, to, the, west, german, budget, in, the, coming, few, years, the, cost, of, german, reunification, for, the, federal, government, is, estimated, to, be, between, 1, 5, and, 2, trillion, euros, according, to, a, 2019, survey, conducted, by, pew, research, center, 89, percent, of, germans, living, in, both, the, west, and, east, believe, that, reunification, was, good, for, germany, with, slightly, more, in, east, than, west, germany, supporting, it, around, 83, percent, of, east, germans, approve, of, and, 13, percent, disapprove, of, eastern, germany, s, transition, to, a, market, economy, with, the, rest, saying, they, were, not, sure, life, satisfaction, in, both, the, east, and, west, has, substantially, increased, since, 1991, with, 15, percent, of, east, germans, placing, their, life, satisfaction, somewhere, between, 7, and, 10, on, a, 0, to, 10, scale, in, 1991, changing, to, 59, percent, in, 2019, for, west, germans, this, change, over, the, same, time, period, was, from, 52, to, 64, percent, however, the, 2019, annual, reunification, report, by, the, german, government, found, that, 57, east, germans, felt, like, second, class, citizens, and, 38, saw, the, reunification,
