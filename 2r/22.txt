https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Antarctica
the, history, of, antarctica, emerges, from, early, western, theories, of, a, vast, continent, known, as, terra, australis, believed, to, exist, in, the, far, south, of, the, globe, the, term, antarctic, referring, to, the, opposite, of, the, arctic, circle, was, coined, by, marinus, of, tyre, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, the, rounding, of, the, cape, of, good, hope, and, cape, horn, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, proved, that, terra, australis, incognita, unknown, southern, land, if, it, existed, was, a, continent, in, its, own, right, in, 1773, james, cook, and, his, crew, crossed, the, antarctic, circle, for, the, first, time, although, he, discovered, new, islands, he, did, not, sight, the, continent, itself, it, is, believed, that, he, came, as, close, as, 240, km, 150, mi, from, the, mainland, on, 28, january, 1820, a, russian, expedition, led, by, fabian, gottlieb, von, bellingshausen, and, mikhail, lazarev, reached, 69, 21, south, latitude, 2, 15, west, longitude, and, on, february, 2d, 66, 25, south, latitude, 1, 11, west, longitude, at, both, of, which, positions, he, was, stopped, by, the, pack, he, then, steered, eastward, and, on, february, 17th, reached, 69, 6, south, latitude, and, on, the, 19th, 68, 5, south, latitude, 16, 37, east, longitude, later, he, reached, 66, 53, south, latitude, 40, 56, east, longitude, where, he, thought, land, must, be, near, on, account, of, the, numbers, of, birds, ten, months, later, an, american, sealer, nathaniel, palmer, became, the, first, to, sight, antarctica, on, 17, november, 1820, the, first, landing, was, most, likely, just, over, a, year, later, when, english, born, american, captain, john, davis, a, sealer, set, foot, on, the, ice, several, expeditions, attempted, to, reach, the, south, pole, in, the, early, 20th, century, during, the, heroic, age, of, antarctic, exploration, many, resulted, in, injury, and, death, norwegian, roald, amundsen, finally, reached, the, pole, on, 14, december, 1911, following, a, dramatic, race, with, the, briton, robert, falcon, scott, some, authors, have, suggested, that, a, figure, in, polynesians, oral, tradition, from, rarotonga, hui, te, rangiora, also, known, as, ui, te, rangiora, and, his, crew, explored, antarctic, waters, in, the, early, seventh, century, on, the, vessel, te, ivi, o, atea, accounts, name, the, area, te, tai, uka, a, pia, what, does, it, literally, mean, powdered, pia, but, in, some, interpretations, it, may, refer, to, snow, or, ice, due, to, the, lack, of, a, word, for, these, phenomena, in, polynesian, languages, however, this, interpretation, of, the, original, account, is, disputed, by, te, rangi, h, roa, sir, peter, henry, buck, who, lists, evidence, for, his, belief, that, later, historians, embellished, the, tales, by, adding, details, learned, from, european, whalers, and, teachers, this, interpretation, of, oral, history, and, the, probability, of, such, a, voyage, have, likewise, been, dismissed, more, recently, by, ng, i, tahu, scholars, who, agree, that, it, is, very, unlikely, that, m, ori, or, other, polynesian, voyaging, reached, the, antarctic, aristotle, speculated, now, since, there, must, be, a, region, bearing, the, same, relation, to, the, southern, pole, as, the, place, we, live, in, bears, to, our, pole, it, was, not, until, prince, henry, the, navigator, began, in, 1418, to, encourage, the, penetration, of, the, torrid, zone, in, the, effort, to, reach, india, by, circumnavigating, africa, that, european, exploration, of, the, southern, hemisphere, began, in, 1473, portuguese, navigator, lopes, gon, alves, proved, that, the, equator, could, be, crossed, and, cartographers, and, sailors, began, to, assume, the, existence, of, another, temperate, continent, to, the, south, of, the, known, world, the, doubling, of, the, cape, of, good, hope, in, 1487, by, bartolomeu, dias, first, brought, explorers, within, touch, of, the, antarctic, cold, and, proved, that, there, was, an, ocean, separating, africa, from, any, antarctic, land, that, might, exist, ferdinand, magellan, who, passed, through, the, straits, of, magellan, in, 1520, assumed, that, the, islands, of, tierra, del, fuego, to, the, south, were, an, extension, of, this, unknown, southern, land, and, it, appeared, as, such, on, a, map, by, ortelius, terra, australis, recenter, inventa, sed, nondum, plene, cognita, southern, land, recently, discovered, but, not, yet, fully, known, in, 1539, the, king, of, spain, charles, v, created, the, governorate, of, terra, australis, granted, to, pedro, sancho, de, la, hoz, who, in, 1540, transferred, the, title, to, the, conqueror, pedro, de, valdivia, and, later, was, incorporated, to, chile, european, geographers, connected, the, coast, of, tierra, del, fuego, with, the, coast, of, new, guinea, on, their, globes, and, allowing, their, imaginations, to, run, riot, in, the, vast, unknown, spaces, of, the, south, atlantic, south, indian, ocean, and, pacific, ocean, they, sketched, the, outlines, of, the, terra, australis, incognita, unknown, southern, land, a, vast, continent, stretching, in, parts, into, the, tropics, the, search, for, this, great, south, land, or, third, world, was, a, leading, motive, of, explorers, in, the, 16th, and, the, early, part, of, the, 17th, centuries, in, 1599, according, to, the, account, of, jacob, le, maire, the, blown, off, course, dutch, dirck, gerritsz, pomp, observed, mountainous, land, at, latitude, 64, if, so, these, were, the, south, shetland, islands, and, possibly, the, first, european, sighting, of, antarctica, or, offshore, lying, islands, belonging, to, it, other, accounts, however, do, not, note, this, observation, casting, doubt, on, their, accuracy, a, similar, incident, happened, to, the, spaniard, gabriel, de, castilla, claimed, to, have, sighted, snow, covered, mountains, beyond, the, 64, s, in, 1603, both, of, these, potential, discoveries, had, no, consequences, before, the, construction, of, the, panama, canal, the, passages, around, tierra, del, fuego, notorious, for, their, harsh, weather, served, as, the, primary, route, between, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, many, ships, navigating, this, route, reported, drifting, off, course, beyond, the, 60th, parallel, yet, no, land, was, ever, sighted, quir, s, in, 1606, took, possession, for, the, king, of, spain, all, of, the, lands, he, had, discovered, in, australia, del, espiritu, santo, the, new, hebrides, and, those, he, would, discover, even, to, the, pole, francis, drake, like, spanish, explorers, before, him, had, speculated, that, there, might, be, an, open, channel, south, of, tierra, del, fuego, indeed, when, schouten, and, le, maire, discovered, the, southern, extremity, of, tierra, del, fuego, and, named, it, cape, horn, in, 1615, they, proved, that, the, tierra, del, fuego, archipelago, was, of, small, extent, and, not, connected, to, the, southern, land, finally, in, 1642, tasman, showed, that, even, new, holland, was, separated, by, sea, from, any, continuous, southern, continent, voyagers, round, the, horn, frequently, met, with, contrary, winds, and, were, driven, southward, into, snowy, skies, and, ice, encumbered, seas, but, so, far, as, can, be, ascertained, none, of, them, before, 1770, reached, the, antarctic, circle, or, knew, it, if, they, did, the, dutch, expedition, to, valdivia, of, 1643, intended, to, round, cape, horn, sailing, through, le, maire, strait, but, strong, winds, made, it, instead, drift, south, and, east, northerly, winds, pushed, the, expedition, as, far, south, as, 61, 59, s, where, icebergs, were, abundant, before, a, southerly, wind, that, begun, on, april, 7, allowed, the, fleet, to, advance, west, the, small, fleet, led, by, hendrik, brouwer, managed, to, enter, the, pacific, ocean, sailing, south, of, isla, de, los, estados, disproving, earlier, beliefs, that, it, was, part, of, terra, australis, the, visit, to, south, georgia, by, the, english, merchant, anthony, de, la, roch, in, 1675, was, the, first, ever, discovery, of, land, south, of, the, antarctic, convergence, soon, after, the, voyage, cartographers, started, to, depict, roch, island, honouring, the, discoverer, james, cook, was, aware, of, la, roch, s, discovery, when, surveying, and, mapping, the, island, in, 1775, edmond, halley, s, voyage, in, hms, paramour, for, magnetic, investigations, in, the, south, atlantic, met, the, pack, ice, in, 52, s, in, january, 1700, but, that, latitude, he, reached, 140, mi, or, 230, km, off, the, north, coast, of, south, georgia, was, his, farthest, south, a, determined, effort, on, the, part, of, the, french, naval, officer, jean, baptiste, charles, bouvet, de, lozier, to, discover, the, south, land, described, by, a, half, legendary, sieur, de, gonneyville, resulted, in, the, discovery, of, bouvet, island, in, 54, 10, s, and, in, the, navigation, of, 48, of, longitude, of, ice, cumbered, sea, nearly, in, 55, s, in, 1739, in, 1771, yves, joseph, kerguelen, sailed, from, france, with, instructions, to, proceed, south, from, mauritius, in, search, of, a, very, large, continent, he, lighted, upon, a, land, in, 50, s, which, he, called, south, france, and, believed, to, be, the, central, mass, of, the, southern, continent, he, was, sent, out, again, to, complete, the, exploration, of, the, new, land, and, found, it, to, be, only, an, inhospitable, island, which, he, renamed, the, isle, of, desolation, but, which, was, ultimately, named, after, him, the, obsession, of, the, undiscovered, continent, culminated, in, the, brain, of, alexander, dalrymple, the, brilliant, and, erratic, hydrographer, who, was, nominated, by, the, royal, society, to, command, the, transit, of, venus, expedition, to, tahiti, in, 1769, the, command, of, the, expedition, was, given, by, the, admiralty, to, captain, james, cook, sailing, in, 1772, with, the, resolution, a, vessel, of, 462, tons, under, his, own, command, and, the, adventure, of, 336, tons, under, captain, tobias, furneaux, cook, first, searched, in, vain, for, bouvet, island, then, sailed, for, 20, degrees, of, longitude, to, the, westward, in, latitude, 58, s, and, then, 30, eastward, for, the, most, part, south, of, 60, s, a, higher, southern, latitude, than, had, ever, been, voluntarily, entered, before, by, any, vessel, on, 17, january, 1773, the, antarctic, circle, was, crossed, for, the, first, time, in, history, and, the, two, ships, reached, 67, 15, s, by, 39, 35, e, where, their, course, was, stopped, by, ice, cook, then, turned, northward, to, look, for, french, southern, and, antarctic, lands, of, the, discovery, of, which, he, had, received, news, at, cape, town, but, from, the, rough, determination, of, his, longitude, by, kerguelen, cook, reached, the, assigned, latitude, 10, too, far, east, and, did, not, see, it, he, turned, south, again, and, was, stopped, by, ice, in, 61, 52, s, by, 95, e, and, continued, eastward, nearly, on, the, parallel, of, 60, s, to, 147, e, on, 16, march, the, approaching, winter, drove, him, northward, for, rest, to, new, zealand, and, the, tropical, islands, of, the, pacific, in, november, 1773, cook, left, new, zealand, having, parted, company, with, the, adventure, and, reached, 60, s, by, 177, w, whence, he, sailed, eastward, keeping, as, far, south, as, the, floating, ice, allowed, the, antarctic, circle, was, crossed, on, 20, december, and, cook, remained, south, of, it, for, three, days, being, compelled, after, reaching, 67, 31, s, to, stand, north, again, in, 135, w, a, long, detour, to, 47, 50, s, served, to, show, that, there, was, no, land, connection, between, new, zealand, and, tierra, del, fuego, turning, south, again, cook, crossed, the, antarctic, circle, for, the, third, time, at, 109, 30, w, before, his, progress, was, once, again, blocked, by, ice, four, days, later, at, 71, 10, s, by, 106, 54, w, this, point, reached, on, 30, january, 1774, was, the, farthest, south, attained, in, the, 18th, century, with, a, great, detour, to, the, east, almost, to, the, coast, of, south, america, the, expedition, regained, tahiti, for, refreshment, in, november, 1774, cook, started, from, new, zealand, and, crossed, the, south, pacific, without, sighting, land, between, 53, and, 57, s, to, tierra, del, fuego, then, passing, cape, horn, on, 29, december, he, rediscovered, roch, island, renaming, it, isle, of, georgia, and, discovered, the, south, sandwich, islands, named, sandwich, land, by, him, the, only, ice, clad, land, he, had, seen, before, crossing, the, south, atlantic, to, the, cape, of, good, hope, between, 55, and, 60, he, thereby, laid, open, the, way, for, future, antarctic, exploration, by, exploding, the, myth, of, a, habitable, southern, continent, cook, s, most, southerly, discovery, of, land, lay, on, the, temperate, side, of, the, 60th, parallel, and, he, convinced, himself, that, if, land, lay, farther, south, it, was, practically, inaccessible, and, of, no, economic, value, the, first, land, south, of, the, parallel, 60, south, latitude, was, documented, by, captain, of, the, cargo, ship, williams, englishman, william, smith, who, sighted, livingston, island, in, the, south, shetlands, archipelago, on, 19, february, 1819, but, did, not, land, on, it, smith, was, blown, off, course, to, the, south, while, en, route, to, valparaiso, on, reaching, valparaiso, smith, reported, his, discovery, of, the, islands, and, the, abundance, of, seals, there, to, captain, william, henry, shirreff, of, hms, andromache, which, had, arrived, there, about, 5, september, 1818, smit, was, unable, to, visit, the, islands, again, on, his, return, to, the, atlantic, in, october, 1819, smith, revisited, the, south, shetlands, landing, on, king, george, island, on, 16, october, and, claimed, the, new, territories, for, britain, on, 24, november, williams, was, back, at, valparaiso, from, monte, video, at, the, beginning, of, the, following, year, 1820, the, royal, navy, chartered, williams, and, dispatched, with, her, with, lieutenant, edward, bransfield, on, board, to, survey, the, newly, discovered, islands, and, formally, claim, them, for, great, britain, becouse, smith, was, a, civilian, and, his, october, declaration, had, no, legal, force, before, bransfield, s, expedition, reached, its, destination, sealer, and, smith, s, navigator, from, the, previous, expedition, joseph, herring, landed, on, rugged, island, the, second, confirmed, ship, present, in, the, south, shetlands, at, this, time, was, the, american, hersilia, the, americans, learned, of, the, new, land, from, the, crew, of, the, espirito, santo, joseph, herring, s, ship, during, a, landing, in, the, falklands, on, september, 2, 1819, the, spanish, ship, san, telmo, was, lost, in, a, storm, in, the, drake, passage, there, were, 644, people, on, board, including, soldiers, who, were, supposed, to, support, spanish, forces, in, peru, there, is, speculation, that, the, ship, may, have, sunk, near, the, south, shetland, islands, and, even, left, survivors, there, on, the, half, moon, beach, next, to, the, doctor, guillermo, mann, base, stands, a, plaque, commemorating, the, sinking, of, the, san, telmo, it, is, believed, that, william, smith, found, the, remains, of, san, telmo, on, livingston, island, but, smith, himself, never, mentioned, it, and, the, information, is, second, hand, there, is, also, uncertainty, about, where, the, wreck, was, actually, discovered, smith, landed, on, livingston, island, only, during, his, fifth, voyage, to, the, archipelago, after, the, expedition, commanded, by, bransfield, one, possible, explanation, for, this, discrepancy, is, that, smith, named, a, bay, on, king, george, island, shirreff, bay, but, on, a, subsequent, expedition, bransfield, did, not, confirm, this, name, in, the, official, records, as, he, had, already, named, a, location, cape, shirreff, on, livingston, island, additionally, there, are, doubts, as, to, whether, the, modest, remains, were, related, to, san, telmo, during, the, first, season, at, the, turn, of, 1820, and, 1821, four, sealing, ships, were, wrecked, on, the, islands, the, first, generally, recognized, sighting, of, the, antarctic, continent, was, made, at, a, point, within, 32, km, 20, mi, of, the, princess, martha, coast, on, 27, or, 28, january, 1820, the, russian, expedition, led, by, fabian, gottlieb, von, bellingshausen, and, mikhail, lazarev, on, the, ships, vostok, and, mirny, the, discovery, was, described, with, the, problematic, term, materyi, led, russian, which, can, be, translated, as, hard, ice, the, route, of, this, expedition, was, eastward, as, far, south, as, the, ice, conditions, permitted, two, more, observations, were, made, and, then, because, of, the, approach, of, winter, they, proceeded, to, sydney, while, in, australia, bellingshausen, wrote, a, report, in, which, he, stated, that, the, southern, continent, probably, did, not, exist, meaning, that, he, did, not, consider, the, earlier, observations, to, be, a, continent, when, vostok, and, mirny, returned, to, the, antarctic, circle, the, following, summer, they, continued, eastward, discovering, peter, i, island, and, alexander, i, island, although, the, latter, was, considered, part, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, until, 1940, they, then, sailed, north, along, the, antarctic, peninsula, and, reached, the, south, shetland, islands, where, on, 5, february, 1821, near, deception, island, they, encountered, hero, commanded, by, nathaniel, palmer, previously, second, mate, of, the, hersilia, meanwhile, on, 30, january, 1820, edward, bransfield, and, william, smith, sighted, trinity, peninsula, the, northernmost, point, of, the, antarctic, mainland, in, the, years, since, the, discovery, of, the, south, shetland, islands, there, have, been, many, sealing, expeditions, to, the, area, most, of, them, have, been, poorly, documented, and, non, scientific, in, 1950s, the, notes, of, john, davis, captain, of, cecilia, one, of, the, ships, present, there, were, discovered, davis, described, in, them, the, probably, first, landing, on, the, continent, which, was, made, by, his, crew, on, 7, february, 1821, of, the, sealers, the, most, creditable, for, the, exploration, of, the, coast, was, captain, of, hero, nathaniel, palmer, the, crew, of, hero, were, the, second, in, history, to, sight, the, antarctic, peninsula, located, between, 55, and, 80, degrees, west, along, with, english, sealer, george, powell, palmer, also, co, discovered, the, nearby, south, orkney, islands, archipelago, in, 1823, james, weddell, a, british, sealer, sailed, into, what, is, now, known, as, the, weddell, sea, weddell, found, very, favorable, ice, conditions, there, which, allowed, him, to, set, a, record, for, the, furthest, south, since, no, land, was, encountered, during, the, entire, voyage, weddell, assumed, that, the, ocean, extended, to, the, pole, and, that, there, was, no, continent, to, the, south, only, an, archipelago, a, piece, of, wood, from, the, south, shetland, islands, was, the, first, fossil, ever, recorded, from, antarctica, obtained, during, a, private, united, states, expedition, during, 1829, 31, commanded, by, captain, benjamin, pendleton, as, the, seal, population, declined, interest, in, the, region, waned, however, the, search, for, new, seal, colonies, led, to, isolated, discoveries, such, as, the, discovery, of, enderby, land, by, john, biscoe, in, february, 1831, discovery, of, kemp, land, by, peter, kemp, in, 1833, and, discovery, of, balleny, islands, by, john, balleny, in, 1839, in, the, late, 1830s, interest, in, the, far, south, increased, again, resulting, in, the, organisation, of, three, national, scientific, expeditions, during, that, period, at, that, time, it, was, still, unclear, whether, there, was, a, continent, there, or, just, ice, bound, islands, the, first, to, set, off, in, 1837, was, a, french, expedition, led, by, naval, officer, jules, dumont, d, urville, after, reaching, the, antarctic, circle, astrolabe, and, z, l, e, sailed, into, the, weddel, sea, where, they, failed, to, repeat, jemes, weddel, s, feat, at, the, turn, of, february, and, march, 1838, the, expedition, was, already, in, bransfield, strait, where, it, had, mapped, part, of, the, northern, tip, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, which, it, named, the, louis, philippe, land, in, early, 1840, a, french, expedition, returned, to, the, antarctic, circle, having, sailed, from, australia, the, two, ships, reached, the, north, westernmost, and, highest, islet, of, the, rocky, group, of, dumoulin, islands, at, 500, 600, m, from, the, icy, coast, of, the, astrolabe, glacier, tongue, of, the, time, today, about, 4, km, north, from, the, glacier, extremity, near, cape, g, od, sie, and, hoisted, the, french, tricolour, dumont, named, the, archipelago, pointe, g, ologie, and, the, land, beyond, ad, lie, land, the, map, of, the, coast, drawn, under, sail, by, the, hydrographer, cl, ment, adrien, vincendon, dumoulin, is, remarkably, accurate, given, the, means, of, the, time, charles, wilkes, as, commander, of, a, united, states, navy, expedition, in, 1840, discovered, what, is, now, known, as, wilkes, land, a, section, of, the, continent, around, 120, degrees, east, both, expeditions, operated, in, the, same, region, and, time, leading, to, disputed, claims, of, priority, of, discovery, dumont, d, urville, reached, the, adelie, land, on, 21, or, 22, january, 1840, wilkes, on, the, other, hand, claimed, to, have, discovered, the, same, area, which, he, named, wilkes, land, on, 16, january, 1840, from, a, greater, distance, the, differences, in, dates, and, the, uncertainties, regarding, the, exact, locations, of, the, discoveries, led, to, a, rivalry, for, prestige, between, france, and, the, united, states, over, who, was, to, be, the, first, to, discover, the, antarctic, continent, after, the, north, magnetic, pole, was, located, in, 1831, explorers, and, scientists, began, looking, for, the, south, magnetic, pole, one, of, the, explorers, james, clark, ross, a, british, naval, officer, identified, its, approximate, location, but, was, unable, to, reach, it, on, his, 4, year, expedition, from, 1839, to, 1843, commanding, the, british, ships, erebus, and, terror, he, braved, the, pack, ice, and, approached, what, is, now, known, as, the, ross, ice, shelf, a, massive, floating, ice, shelf, over, 100, feet, 30, m, high, his, expedition, sailed, eastward, along, the, southern, antarctic, coast, discovering, mountains, which, were, since, named, after, his, ships, mount, erebus, the, most, active, volcano, on, antarctica, and, mount, terror, these, explorers, despite, their, impressive, contributions, to, south, polar, exploration, were, unable, to, penetrate, the, interior, of, the, continent, and, rather, formed, a, broken, line, of, discovered, lands, along, the, coastline, of, antarctica, following, the, expedition, south, by, the, ships, erebus, and, terror, james, clark, ross, january, 1841, suggested, that, there, were, no, scientific, discoveries, or, problems, worth, exploration, in, the, far, south, what, followed, is, what, historian, h, r, mill, called, the, age, of, averted, interest, and, in, the, following, twenty, years, after, ross, return, there, was, a, general, lull, internationally, in, antarctic, exploration, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, one, of, the, commanders, of, the, research, expeditions, from, around, 1840, was, considered, to, be, the, discoverer, of, antarctica, in, europe, jules, dumont, d, urville, was, usually, considered, while, in, america, charles, wilkes, wilkes, s, priority, was, challenged, due, to, his, changing, the, reported, date, of, his, first, sighting, of, the, continent, twice, the, first, observation, of, the, land, by, an, american, expedition, took, place, on, 16, january, 1840, from, the, deck, of, the, uss, peacock, and, was, supposed, to, involve, distant, observation, of, eld, peak, and, reynolds, peak, along, the, george, v, coast, the, prevailing, view, at, the, time, was, that, the, sighting, of, january, 16, and, the, sighting, of, january, 19, were, fabrications, made, after, d, urville, announced, his, own, sighting, of, the, continent, on, the, evening, 19, january, in, the, late, 19th, century, new, zealand, anthropologist, percy, smith, proposed, a, theory, about, a, polynesian, explorer, named, ui, te, rangiora, who, may, have, reached, antarctica, or, subantarctic, islands, by, the, early, 20th, century, the, 1820, expedition, of, nathaniel, palmer, who, observed, the, antarctic, peninsula, in, november, of, that, year, was, also, revisited, at, the, 1925, the, priority, of, edward, bransfield, s, expedition, which, had, mapped, the, south, shetland, islands, and, sighted, the, trinity, peninsula, on, 30, january, 1820, began, to, be, promoted, in, britain, the, remained, forgotten, and, was, not, taken, into, consideration, until, february, 10, 1949, when, lev, berg, president, of, the, soviet, geographical, society, read, out, a, report, in, which, he, stated, that, russian, sailors, discovered, in, 1821, peter, i, island, alexander, island, traversay, islands, and, others, thus, the, question, was, raised, regarding, the, soviet, development, of, antarctica, and, scientific, research, on, the, discovery, of, the, continent, within, a, short, time, the, expedition, documents, were, examined, based, on, a, letter, written, by, mikhail, lazarev, to, a, friend, after, the, expedition, it, was, assumed, that, the, ice, shelf, was, sighted, on, 28, january, 1820, which, lazarev, defined, as, materyi, led, russian, which, can, be, translated, as, hard, ice, however, lazarev, may, have, been, mistaken, about, the, chronology, of, events, the, first, russian, antarctic, expedition, remained, largely, forgotten, until, 10, february, 1949, when, lev, berg, president, of, the, soviet, geographical, society, presented, a, report, stating, that, russian, sailors, had, discovered, peter, i, island, alexander, island, traversay, islands, and, others, in, 1821, this, raised, questions, about, the, russian, and, soviet, role, in, antarctic, exploration, and, the, scientific, research, surrounding, the, discovery, of, the, continent, shortly, thereafter, expedition, documents, were, reexamined, based, on, a, letter, written, by, mikhail, lazarev, to, a, friend, after, the, expedition, it, was, concluded, that, an, ice, shelf, which, lazarev, described, as, materyi, led, translated, as, hard, ice, was, sighted, on, 28, january, 1820, however, there, is, some, uncertainty, regarding, lazarev, s, accuracy, in, recalling, the, chronology, of, events, the, first, documented, landing, on, the, mainland, of, east, antarctica, was, at, victoria, land, by, the, american, sealer, mercator, cooper, on, 26, january, 1853, the, heroic, age, of, antarctic, exploration, began, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, and, closed, with, ernest, shackleton, s, imperial, trans, antarctic, expedition, in, 1917, during, this, period, the, antarctic, continent, became, the, focus, of, an, international, effort, that, resulted, in, intensive, scientific, and, geographical, exploration, and, in, which, 17, major, antarctic, expeditions, were, launched, from, ten, countries, an, important, precursor, to, the, heroic, age, of, antarctic, exploration, was, the, dundee, antarctic, expedition, of, 1892, 93, in, which, four, dundee, whaling, ships, travelled, south, to, the, antarctic, in, search, of, whales, instead, of, their, usual, arctic, route, the, expedition, was, accompanied, by, several, naturalists, including, william, speirs, bruce, and, an, artist, william, gordon, burn, murdoch, the, publications, both, scientific, and, popular, and, exhibitions, that, resulted, did, much, to, reignite, public, interest, in, the, antarctic, the, performance, of, the, whaling, ships, was, also, crucial, in, the, decision, to, build, the, rrs, discovery, in, dundee, following, on, from, that, expedition, the, specific, impetus, for, the, heroic, age, of, antarctic, exploration, was, a, lecture, given, by, dr, john, murray, entitled, the, renewal, of, antarctic, exploration, given, to, the, royal, geographical, society, in, london, 27, november, 1893, murray, advocated, that, research, into, the, antarctic, should, be, organised, to, resolve, the, outstanding, geographical, questions, still, posed, in, the, south, furthermore, the, royal, geographical, society, instated, an, antarctic, committee, shortly, prior, to, this, in, 1887, which, successfully, encouraged, many, whalers, to, explore, the, southern, regions, of, the, world, and, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, lecture, given, by, murray, the, norwegian, ship, antarctic, was, put, ashore, at, cape, adare, on, 24, january, 1895, in, august, 1895, the, sixth, international, geographical, congress, in, london, passed, a, general, resolution, calling, on, scientific, societies, throughout, the, world, to, promote, the, cause, of, antarctic, exploration, in, whatever, ways, seem, to, them, most, effective, such, work, would, bring, additions, to, almost, every, branch, of, science, the, congress, had, been, addressed, by, the, norwegian, carsten, borchgrevink, who, had, just, returned, from, a, whaling, expedition, during, which, he, had, become, one, of, the, first, to, set, foot, on, the, antarctic, mainland, during, his, address, borchgrevink, outlined, plans, for, a, full, scale, pioneering, antarctic, expedition, to, be, based, at, cape, adare, the, heroic, age, was, inaugurated, by, an, expedition, launched, by, the, belgian, geographical, society, in, 1897, borchgrevink, followed, a, year, later, with, a, privately, sponsored, british, expedition, some, histories, consider, the, discovery, expedition, which, departed, in, 1901, as, the, first, proper, expedition, of, the, heroic, age, the, belgian, antarctic, expedition, was, led, by, belgian, adrian, de, gerlache, in, 1898, they, became, the, first, men, to, spend, winter, on, antarctica, when, their, ship, belgica, became, trapped, in, the, ice, they, became, stuck, on, 28, february, 1898, and, only, managed, to, get, out, of, the, ice, on, 14, march, 1899, during, their, forced, stay, several, men, lost, their, sanity, not, only, because, of, the, antarctic, winter, night, and, the, endured, hardship, but, also, because, of, the, language, problems, between, the, different, nationalities, this, was, the, first, expedition, to, overwinter, within, the, antarctic, circle, and, they, visited, the, south, shetland, islands, the, southern, cross, expedition, began, in, 1898, and, lasted, for, two, years, this, was, the, first, expedition, to, overwinter, on, the, antarctic, mainland, cape, adare, and, was, the, first, to, make, use, of, dogs, and, sledges, it, made, the, first, ascent, of, the, great, ice, barrier, the, great, ice, barrier, later, became, formally, known, as, the, ross, ice, shelf, the, expedition, set, a, farthest, south, record, at, 78, 30, s, it, also, calculated, the, location, of, the, south, magnetic, pole, the, discovery, expedition, was, then, launched, from, 1901, to, 1904, and, was, led, by, robert, falcon, scott, it, made, the, first, ascent, of, the, western, mountains, in, victoria, land, and, discovered, the, polar, plateau, its, southern, journey, set, a, new, farthest, south, record, 82, 17, s, many, other, geographical, features, were, discovered, mapped, and, named, this, was, the, first, of, several, expeditions, based, in, mcmurdo, sound, a, year, later, the, scottish, national, antarctic, expedition, was, launched, headed, by, william, speirs, bruce, ormond, house, was, established, as, a, meteorological, observatory, on, laurie, island, in, the, south, orkneys, and, was, the, first, permanent, base, in, antarctica, the, weddell, sea, was, penetrated, to, 74, 01, s, and, the, coastline, of, coats, land, was, discovered, defining, the, sea, s, eastern, limits, ernest, shackleton, who, had, been, a, member, of, scott, s, expedition, organized, and, led, the, nimrod, expedition, from, 1907, to, 1909, the, expedition, s, primary, objective, was, of, reaching, the, south, pole, based, in, mcmurdo, sound, the, expedition, pioneered, the, beardmore, glacier, route, to, the, south, pole, and, the, limited, use, of, motorised, transport, its, southern, march, reached, 88, 23, s, a, new, farthest, south, record, 97, geographical, miles, from, the, pole, before, having, to, turn, back, during, the, expedition, shackleton, was, the, first, to, reach, the, polar, plateau, parties, led, by, t, w, edgeworth, david, also, became, the, first, to, climb, mount, erebus, and, to, reach, the, south, magnetic, pole, the, first, german, antarctic, expedition, was, sent, to, investigate, eastern, antarctica, in, 1901, it, discovered, the, coast, of, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, land, and, mount, gauss, the, expedition, s, ship, became, trapped, in, ice, however, which, prevented, more, extensive, exploration, the, swedish, antarctic, expedition, operating, at, the, same, time, worked, in, the, east, coastal, area, of, graham, land, and, was, marooned, on, snow, hill, island, and, paulet, island, in, the, weddell, sea, after, the, sinking, of, its, expedition, ship, it, was, rescued, by, the, argentinian, naval, vessel, uruguay, the, french, organized, their, first, expedition, in, 1903, under, the, leadership, of, jean, baptiste, charcot, originally, intended, as, a, relief, expedition, for, the, stranded, nordenski, ld, party, the, main, work, of, this, expedition, was, the, mapping, and, charting, of, islands, and, the, western, coasts, of, graham, land, on, the, antarctic, peninsula, a, section, of, the, coast, was, explored, and, named, loubet, land, after, the, president, of, france, a, follow, up, trip, was, organized, from, 1908, to, 1910, which, continued, the, earlier, work, of, the, french, expedition, with, a, general, exploration, of, the, bellingshausen, sea, and, the, discovery, of, islands, and, other, features, including, marguerite, bay, charcot, island, renaud, island, mikkelsen, bay, rothschild, island, the, prize, of, the, heroic, age, was, to, find, and, reach, the, south, pole, two, expeditions, set, off, in, 1910, to, attain, this, goal, a, party, led, by, norwegian, polar, explorer, roald, amundsen, from, the, ship, fram, and, robert, falcon, scott, s, british, group, from, the, terra, nova, amundsen, succeeded, in, reaching, the, pole, on, 14, december, 1911, using, a, route, from, the, bay, of, whales, to, the, polar, plateau, via, the, axel, heiberg, glacier, scott, and, his, four, companions, reached, the, south, pole, via, the, beardmore, route, on, 17, january, 1912, 33, days, after, amundsen, all, five, died, on, the, return, journey, from, the, pole, through, a, combination, of, starvation, and, cold, the, amundsen, scott, south, pole, station, was, later, named, after, these, two, men, the, australasian, antarctic, expedition, took, place, between, 1911, 1914, and, was, led, by, sir, douglas, mawson, it, concentrated, on, the, stretch, of, antarctic, coastline, between, cape, adare, and, mount, gauss, carrying, out, mapping, and, survey, work, on, coastal, and, inland, territories, discoveries, included, commonwealth, bay, ninnis, glacier, mertz, glacier, and, queen, mary, land, major, accomplishments, were, made, in, geology, glaciology, and, terrestrial, biology, the, imperial, trans, antarctic, expedition, of, 1914, 1917, was, led, by, ernest, shackleton, and, set, out, to, cross, the, continent, via, the, south, pole, however, their, ship, the, endurance, was, trapped, and, crushed, by, pack, ice, in, the, weddell, sea, before, they, were, able, to, land, the, expedition, members, survived, after, a, journey, on, sledges, over, pack, ice, a, prolonged, drift, on, an, ice, floe, and, a, voyage, in, three, small, boats, to, elephant, island, then, shackleton, and, five, others, crossed, the, southern, ocean, in, an, open, boat, called, james, caird, and, made, the, first, crossing, of, south, georgia, to, raise, the, alarm, at, the, whaling, station, grytviken, a, related, component, of, the, trans, antarctic, expedition, was, the, ross, sea, party, led, by, aeneas, mackintosh, its, objective, was, to, lay, depots, across, the, great, ice, barrier, in, order, to, supply, shackleton, s, party, crossing, from, the, weddell, sea, all, the, required, depots, were, laid, but, in, the, process, three, men, including, the, leader, mackintosh, died, shackleton, s, last, expedition, and, the, one, that, brought, the, heroic, age, to, a, close, was, the, shackleton, rowett, expedition, from, 1921, to, 1922, on, board, the, ship, quest, its, vaguely, defined, objectives, included, coastal, mapping, a, possible, continental, circumnavigation, the, investigation, of, sub, antarctic, islands, and, oceanographic, work, after, shackleton, s, death, on, 5, january, 1922, quest, completed, a, shortened, programme, before, returning, home, after, shackleton, s, last, expedition, there, was, a, hiatus, in, antarctic, exploration, for, about, seven, years, from, 1929, aircraft, and, mechanized, transportation, were, increasingly, used, earning, this, period, the, sobriquet, of, the, mechanical, age, hubert, wilkins, first, visited, antarctica, in, 1921, 1922, as, an, ornithologist, attached, to, the, shackleton, rowett, expedition, from, 1927, wilkins, and, pilot, carl, ben, eielson, began, exploring, the, arctic, by, aircraft, on, 15, april, 1928, only, a, year, after, charles, lindbergh, s, flight, across, the, atlantic, wilkins, and, eielson, made, a, trans, arctic, crossing, from, point, barrow, alaska, to, spitsbergen, arriving, about, 20, hours, later, on, 16, april, touching, along, the, way, at, grant, land, on, ellesmere, island, for, this, feat, and, his, prior, work, wilkins, was, knighted, with, financial, backing, from, william, randolph, hearst, wilkins, returned, to, the, south, pole, and, flew, over, antarctica, in, the, san, francisco, he, named, the, island, of, hearst, land, after, his, sponsor, us, navy, rear, admiral, richard, evelyn, byrd, led, five, expeditions, to, antarctica, during, the, 1930s, 1940s, and, 1950s, he, overflew, the, south, pole, with, pilot, bernt, balchen, on, 28, and, 29, november, 1929, to, match, his, overflight, of, the, north, pole, in, 1926, byrd, s, explorations, had, science, as, a, major, objective, and, extensively, used, the, aircraft, to, explore, the, continent, captain, finn, ronne, byrd, s, executive, officer, returned, to, antarctica, with, his, own, expedition, in, 1947, 1948, with, navy, support, three, planes, and, dogs, ronne, disproved, the, notion, that, the, continent, was, divided, in, two, and, established, that, east, and, west, antarctica, was, one, single, continent, i, e, that, the, weddell, sea, and, the, ross, sea, are, not, connected, the, expedition, explored, and, mapped, large, parts, of, palmer, land, and, the, weddell, sea, coastline, and, identified, the, ronne, ice, shelf, named, by, ronne, after, his, wife, edith, ronne, ronne, covered, 5, 800, kilometres, 3, 600, mi, by, ski, and, dog, sled, more, than, any, other, explorer, in, history, the, 1955, 1958, commonwealth, trans, antarctic, expedition, successfully, completed, the, first, overland, crossing, of, antarctica, via, the, south, pole, although, supported, by, the, british, and, other, commonwealth, governments, most, of, the, funding, came, from, corporate, and, individual, donations, it, was, headed, by, british, explorer, dr, vivian, fuchs, with, new, zealander, sir, edmund, hillary, leading, the, new, zealand, ross, sea, support, team, after, spending, the, winter, of, 1957, at, shackleton, base, fuchs, finally, set, out, on, the, transcontinental, journey, in, november, 1957, with, a, twelve, man, team, travelling, in, six, vehicles, three, sno, cats, two, weasels, and, one, specially, adapted, muskeg, tractor, en, route, the, team, were, also, tasked, with, carrying, out, scientific, research, including, seismic, soundings, and, gravimetric, readings, in, parallel, hillary, s, team, had, set, up, scott, base, which, was, to, be, fuchs, final, destination, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, continent, at, mcmurdo, sound, on, the, ross, sea, using, three, converted, ferguson, te20, tractors, and, one, m29, weasel, abandoned, part, way, hillary, and, his, three, men, ron, balham, peter, mulgrew, and, murray, ellis, were, responsible, for, route, finding, and, laying, a, line, of, supply, depots, up, the, skelton, glacier, and, across, the, polar, plateau, on, towards, the, south, pole, for, the, use, of, fuchs, on, the, final, leg, of, his, journey, other, members, of, hillary, s, team, carried, out, geological, surveys, around, the, ross, sea, and, victoria, land, areas, hillary, s, party, reached, the, south, pole, on, 3, january, 1958, and, was, just, the, third, preceded, by, amundsen, in, 1911, and, scott, in, 1912, to, reach, the, pole, overland, fuchs, team, reached, the, pole, from, the, opposite, direction, on, 19, january, 1958, where, they, met, up, with, hillary, fuchs, then, continued, overland, following, the, route, that, hillary, had, laid, and, on, 2, march, succeeded, in, reaching, scott, base, completing, the, first, overland, crossing, of, the, continent, by, land, via, the, south, pole, according, to, argentina, and, chile, the, spanish, empire, had, claims, on, antarctica, the, capitulaci, n, governorship, granted, to, the, conquistador, pedro, s, nchez, de, la, hoz, in, 1539, by, the, king, of, spain, charles, v, explicitly, included, all, lands, south, of, the, straits, of, magellan, terra, australis, and, tierra, del, fuego, and, by, extension, potentially, the, entire, continent, of, antarctica, and, to, the, east, and, west, the, borders, were, the, ones, specified, in, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, and, zaragoza, respectively, thus, creating, the, governorate, of, terra, australis, de, la, hoz, transferred, the, title, to, the, conqueror, pedro, de, valdivia, in, 1540, in, 1555, the, claim, was, incorporated, to, chile, this, grant, established, according, to, argentina, and, chile, that, an, animus, occupandi, existed, on, the, part, of, spain, in, antarctica, spain, s, sovereignty, claim, over, parts, of, antarctica, was, according, to, chile, and, argentina, internationally, recognized, with, the, inter, caetera, bull, of, 1493, and, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, of, 1494, argentina, and, chile, treat, these, treaties, as, legal, international, treaties, mediated, by, the, catholic, church, that, was, at, that, time, a, recognized, arbiter, in, such, matters, each, country, currently, has, claimed, a, sector, of, the, antarctic, continent, that, is, more, or, less, directly, south, of, its, national, antarctic, facing, lands, modern, spain, has, not, claimed, any, antarctic, territory, it, operates, two, summer, research, stations, gabriel, de, castilla, base, and, juan, carlos, i, base, in, the, south, shetland, islands, the, united, kingdom, reasserted, sovereignty, over, the, falkland, islands, in, the, far, south, atlantic, in, 1833, and, maintained, a, continuous, presence, there, in, 1908, the, british, government, extended, its, territorial, claim, by, declaring, sovereignty, over, south, georgia, the, south, orkneys, the, south, shetlands, and, the, sandwich, islands, and, graham, s, land, situated, in, the, south, atlantic, ocean, and, on, the, antarctic, continent, to, the, south, of, the, 50th, parallel, of, south, latitude, and, lying, between, the, 20th, and, the, 80th, degrees, of, west, longitude, all, these, territories, were, administered, as, falkland, islands, dependencies, from, stanley, by, the, governor, of, the, falkland, islands, the, motivation, for, this, declaration, lay, in, the, need, for, regulating, and, taxing, the, whaling, industry, effectively, commercial, operators, would, hunt, whales, in, areas, outside, of, the, official, boundaries, of, the, falkland, islands, and, its, dependencies, and, there, was, a, need, to, close, this, loophole, in, 1917, the, wording, of, the, claim, was, modified, so, as, to, among, other, things, unambiguously, include, all, the, territory, in, the, sector, stretching, to, the, south, pole, thus, encompassing, all, of, the, present, day, british, antarctic, territory, the, new, claim, covered, all, islands, and, territories, whatsoever, between, the, 20th, degree, of, west, longitude, and, the, 50th, degree, of, west, longitude, which, are, situated, south, of, the, 50th, parallel, of, south, latitude, and, all, islands, and, territories, whatsoever, between, the, 50th, degree, of, west, longitude, and, the, 80th, degree, of, west, longitude, which, are, situated, south, of, the, 58th, parallel, of, south, latitude, under, the, ambition, of, leopold, amery, the, under, secretary, of, state, for, the, colonies, britain, attempted, to, incorporate, the, entire, continent, into, the, empire, in, a, memorandum, to, the, governor, generals, for, australia, and, new, zealand, he, wrote, that, with, the, exception, of, chile, and, argentina, and, some, barren, islands, belonging, to, france, it, is, desirable, that, the, whole, of, the, antarctic, should, ultimately, be, included, in, the, british, empire, the, first, step, was, taken, on, 30, july, 1923, when, the, british, government, passed, an, order, in, council, under, the, british, settlements, act, 1887, defining, the, new, borders, for, the, ross, dependency, that, part, of, his, majesty, s, dominions, in, the, antarctic, seas, which, comprises, all, the, islands, and, territories, between, the, 160th, degree, of, east, longitude, and, the, 150th, degree, of, west, longitude, which, are, situated, south, of, the, 60th, degree, of, south, latitude, shall, be, named, the, ross, dependency, the, order, in, council, then, went, on, to, appoint, the, governor, general, and, commander, in, chief, of, new, zealand, as, the, governor, of, the, territory, in, 1930, the, united, kingdom, claimed, enderby, land, in, 1933, a, british, imperial, order, transferred, territory, south, of, 60, s, and, between, meridians, 160, e, and, 45, e, to, australia, as, the, australian, antarctic, territory, following, the, passing, of, the, statute, of, westminster, in, 1931, the, government, of, the, united, kingdom, relinquished, all, control, over, the, government, of, new, zealand, and, australia, this, however, had, no, bearing, on, the, obligations, of, the, governor, general, of, both, countries, in, their, capacity, as, governor, of, the, antarctic, territories, meanwhile, alarmed, by, these, unilateral, declarations, the, french, government, laid, claim, to, a, strip, of, the, continent, in, 1924, the, basis, for, their, claim, to, ad, lie, land, lay, on, the, discovery, of, the, coastline, in, 1840, by, the, french, explorer, jules, dumont, d, urville, who, named, it, after, his, wife, ad, le, the, british, eventually, decided, to, recognize, this, claim, and, the, border, between, ad, lie, land, and, australian, antarctic, territory, was, fixed, definitively, in, 1938, these, developments, also, concerned, norwegian, whaling, interests, who, wished, to, avoid, the, british, taxation, of, whaling, stations, in, the, antarctic, and, were, concerned, that, they, would, be, commercially, excluded, from, the, continent, the, whale, ship, owner, lars, christensen, financed, several, expeditions, to, the, antarctic, with, the, view, to, claim, land, for, norway, and, establish, stations, on, norwegian, territory, to, gain, better, privileges, the, first, expedition, led, by, nils, larsen, and, ola, olstad, landed, on, peter, i, island, in, 1929, and, claimed, the, island, for, norway, on, 6, march, 1931, a, norwegian, royal,

schwabenland, reached, the, pack, ice, off, antarctica, on, 19, january, 1939, during, the, expedition, an, area, of, about, 350, 000, square, kilometres, 140, 000, sq, mi, was, photographed, from, the, air, by, ritscher, who, dropped, darts, inscribed, with, swastikas, every, 26, kilometres, 16, mi, germany, eventually, attempted, to, claim, the, territory, surveyed, by, ritscher, under, the,

was, annexed, by, norway, after, a, royal, decree, announced, that, the, land, bordering, the, falkland, islands, dependencies, in, the, west, and, the, australian, antarctic, dependency, in, the, east, was, to, be, brought, under, norwegian, sovereignty, the, primary, basis, for, the, annexation, was, to, secure, the, norwegian, whaling, industry, s, access, to, the, region, in, 1948, norway, and, the, united, kingdom, agreed, to, limit, queen, maud, land, to, from, 20, w, to, 45, e, and, that, the, bruce, coast, and, coats, land, were, to, be, incorporated, into, norwegian, territory, this, encroachment, of, foreign, powers, was, a, matter, of, immense, disquiet, to, the, nearby, south, american, countries, argentina, and, chile, taking, advantage, of, a, european, continent, plunged, into, turmoil, with, the, onset, of, the, second, world, war, chile, s, president, pedro, aguirre, cerda, declared, the, establishment, of, a, chilean, antarctic, territory, based, on, the, uti, possidetis, juris, principle, inheriting, the, spanish, claims, on, terra, australis, that, depended, on, the, captaincy, general, of, chile, in, the, 20th, century, these, areas, were, claimed, by, britain, argentina, had, an, even, longer, history, of, involvement, in, the, continent, already, in, 1904, the, argentine, government, began, a, permanent, occupation, in, the, area, with, the, purchase, of, a, meteorological, station, on, laurie, island, established, in, 1903, by, dr, william, s, bruce, s, scottish, national, antarctic, expedition, bruce, offered, to, transfer, the,

community, the, establishment, of, a, permanent, base, on, south, orkney, islands, however, haggard, responded, by, reminding, argentina, that, the, south, orkneys, were, british, the, british, position, was, that, argentine, personnel, was, granted, permission, only, for, the, period, of, one, year, the, argentine, government, entered, into, negotiations, with, the, british, in, 1913, over, the, possible, transfer, of, the, island, although, these, talks, were, unsuccessful, argentina, attempted, to, unilaterally, establish, their, sovereignty, with, the, erection, of, markers, national, flags, and, other, symbols, on, january, 14, 1939, norway, declared, its, territorial, claims, on, antarctic, territory, between, 0, and, 20, queen, maud, land, this, alarmed, the, chilean, government, which, led, president, pedro, aguirre, cerda, to, encourage, the, definition, of, the, national, antarctic, territory, with, the, establishment, of, decree, no, 1541, on, september, 7, he, organized, a, commission, to, examine, norway, s, interests, in, the, antarctic, territory, the, chilean, commission, set, the, bounds, according, to, the, theory, of, polar, areas, taking, into, account, geographical, historical, legal, and, diplomatic, precedents, which, were, formalized, by, decree, no, 1747, enacted, on, november, 6, 1940, and, published, on, june, 21, 1955, chile, considered, their, antarctic, rights, arrived, up, to, the, meridian, located, further, west, 53, west, thus, the, country, claimed, to, not, include, the, south, orkney, islands, in, consideration, of, the, rights, of, argentina, in, response, to, this, and, earlier, german, explorations, the, british, admiralty, and, colonial, office, launched, operation, tabarin, in, 1943, to, reassert, british, territorial, claims, against, argentine, and, chilean, incursion, and, establish, a, permanent, british, presence, in, the, antarctic, the, move, was, also, motivated, by, concerns, within, the, foreign, office, about, the, direction, of, united, states, post, war, activity, in, the, region, a, suitable, cover, story, was, the, need, to, deny, use, of, the, area, to, the, enemy, the, kriegsmarine, was, known, to, use, remote, islands, as, rendezvous, points, and, as, shelters, for, commerce, raiders, u, boats, and, supply, ships, also, in, 1941, there, existed, a, fear, that, japan, might, attempt, to, seize, the, falkland, islands, either, as, a, base, or, to, hand, them, over, to, argentina, thus, gaining, political, advantage, for, the, axis, and, denying, their, use, to, britain, in, january, 1942, argentina, declared, its, antarctic, rights, between, the, meridians, at, 25, and, 68, 24, w, which, includes, the, area, of, punta, d, ngeness, on, september, 2, 1946,
