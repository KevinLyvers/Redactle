of, the, earliest, kings, of, anshan, according, to, the, cyrus, cylinder, the, oldest, extant, genealogy, of, the, achaemenids, the, kings, of, anshan, were, teispes, cyrus, i, cambyses, i, and, cyrus, ii, also, known, as, cyrus, the, great, who, founded, the, empire, the, later, behistun, inscription, written, by, darius, the, great, claims, that, teispes, was, the, son, of, achaemenes, and, that, darius, is, also, descended, from, teispes, through, a, different, line, but, no, earlier, texts, mention, achaemenes, in, herodotus, histories, he, writes, that, cyrus, the, great, was, the, son, of, cambyses, i, and, mandane, of, media, the, daughter, of, astyages, the, king, of, the, median, empire, cyrus, revolted, against, the, median, empire, in, 553, bc, and, in, 550, bc, succeeded, in, defeating, the, medes, capturing, astyages, and, taking, the, median, capital, city, of, ecbatana, once, in, control, of, ecbatana, cyrus, styled, himself, as, the, successor, to, astyages, and, assumed, control, of, the, entire, empire, by, inheriting, astyages, empire, he, also, inherited, the, territorial, conflicts, the, medes, had, with, both, lydia, and, the, neo, babylonian, empire, king, croesus, of, lydia, sought, to, take, advantage, of, the, new, international, situation, by, advancing, into, what, had, previously, been, median, territory, in, asia, minor, cyrus, led, a, counterattack, which, not, only, fought, off, croesus, armies, but, also, led, to, the, capture, of, sardis, and, the, fall, of, the, lydian, kingdom, in, 546, bc, cyrus, placed, pactyes, in, charge, of, collecting, tribute, in, lydia, and, left, but, once, cyrus, had, left, pactyes, instigated, a, rebellion, against, cyrus, cyrus, sent, the, median, general, mazares, to, deal, with, the, rebellion, and, pactyes, was, captured, mazares, and, after, his, death, harpagus, set, about, reducing, all, the, cities, which, had, taken, part, in, the, rebellion, the, subjugation, of, lydia, took, about, four, years, in, total, when, the, power, in, ecbatana, changed, hands, from, the, medes, to, the, persians, many, tributaries, to, the, median, empire, believed, their, situation, had, changed, and, revolted, against, cyrus, this, forced, cyrus, to, fight, wars, against, bactria, and, the, nomadic, saka, in, central, asia, during, these, wars, cyrus, established, several, garrison, towns, in, central, asia, including, the, cyropolis, nothing, is, known, of, persia, babylon, relations, between, 547, and, 539, bc, but, it, is, likely, that, there, were, hostilities, between, the, two, empires, for, several, years, leading, up, to, the, war, of, 540, 539, bc, and, the, fall, of, babylon, in, october, 539, bc, cyrus, won, a, battle, against, the, babylonians, at, opis, then, took, sippar, without, a, fight, before, finally, capturing, the, city, of, babylon, on, 12, october, where, the, babylonian, king, nabonidus, was, taken, prisoner, upon, taking, control, of, the, city, cyrus, depicted, himself, in, propaganda, as, restoring, the, divine, order, which, had, been, disrupted, by, nabonidus, who, had, promoted, the, cult, of, sin, rather, than, marduk, and, he, also, portrayed, himself, as, restoring, the, heritage, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, by, comparing, himself, to, the, assyrian, king, ashurbanipal, the, hebrew, bible, also, unreservedly, praises, cyrus, for, his, actions, in, the, conquest, of, babylon, referring, to, him, as, yahweh, s, anointed, he, is, credited, with, freeing, the, people, of, judah, from, their, exile, and, with, authorizing, the, reconstruction, of, much, of, jerusalem, including, the, second, temple, in, 530, bc, cyrus, died, presumably, while, on, a, military, expedition, against, the, massagetae, in, central, asia, he, was, succeeded, by, his, eldest, son, cambyses, ii, while, his, younger, son, bardiya, received, a, large, territory, in, central, asia, by, 525, bc, cambyses, had, successfully, subjugated, phoenicia, and, cyprus, and, was, making, preparations, to, invade, egypt, with, the, newly, created, persian, navy, pharaoh, amasis, ii, had, died, in, 526, and, had, been, succeeded, by, psamtik, iii, resulting, in, the, defection, of, key, egyptian, allies, to, the, persians, psamtik, positioned, his, army, at, pelusium, in, the, nile, delta, he, was, soundly, defeated, by, the, persians, in, the, battle, of, pelusium, before, fleeing, to, memphis, where, the, persians, defeated, him, and, took, him, prisoner, after, attempting, a, failed, revolt, psamtik, iii, promptly, committed, suicide, herodotus, depicts, cambyses, as, openly, antagonistic, to, the, egyptian, people, and, their, gods, cults, temples, and, priests, in, particular, stressing, the, murder, of, the, sacred, bull, apis, he, says, that, these, actions, led, to, a, madness, that, caused, him, to, kill, his, brother, bardiya, who, herodotus, says, was, killed, in, secret, his, own, sister, wife, and, croesus, of, lydia, he, then, concludes, that, cambyses, completely, lost, his, mind, and, all, later, classical, authors, repeat, the, themes, of, cambyses, impiety, and, madness, however, this, is, based, on, spurious, information, as, the, epitaph, of, apis, from, 524, bc, shows, that, cambyses, participated, in, the, funeral, rites, of, apis, styling, himself, as, pharaoh, following, the, conquest, of, egypt, the, libyans, and, the, greeks, of, cyrene, and, barca, in, present, day, eastern, libya, cyrenaica, surrendered, to, cambyses, and, sent, tribute, without, a, fight, cambyses, then, planned, invasions, of, carthage, the, oasis, of, ammon, and, ethiopia, herodotus, claims, that, the, naval, invasion, of, carthage, was, canceled, because, the, phoenicians, who, made, up, a, large, part, of, cambyses, fleet, refused, to, take, up, arms, against, their, own, people, but, modern, historians, doubt, whether, an, invasion, of, carthage, was, ever, planned, at, all, however, cambyses, dedicated, his, efforts, to, the, other, two, campaigns, aiming, to, improve, the, empire, s, strategic, position, in, africa, by, conquering, the, kingdom, of, mero, and, taking, strategic, positions, in, the, western, oases, to, this, end, he, established, a, garrison, at, elephantine, consisting, mainly, of, jewish, soldiers, who, remained, stationed, at, elephantine, throughout, cambyses, reign, the, invasions, of, ammon, and, ethiopia, themselves, were, failures, herodotus, claims, that, the, invasion, of, ethiopia, was, a, failure, due, to, the, madness, of, cambyses, and, the, lack, of, supplies, for, his, men, but, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, the, expedition, was, not, a, failure, and, a, fortress, at, the, second, cataract, of, the, nile, on, the, border, between, egypt, and, kush, remained, in, use, throughout, the, achaemenid, period, the, events, surrounding, cambyses, s, death, and, bardiya, s, succession, are, greatly, debated, as, there, are, many, conflicting, accounts, according, to, herodotus, as, bardiya, s, assassination, had, been, committed, in, secret, the, majority, of, persians, still, believed, him, to, be, alive, this, allowed, two, magi, to, rise, up, against, cambyses, with, one, of, them, sitting, on, the, throne, able, to, impersonate, bardiya, because, of, their, remarkable, physical, resemblance, and, shared, name, smerdis, in, herodotus, s, accounts, ctesias, writes, that, when, cambyses, had, bardiya, killed, he, immediately, put, the, magus, sphendadates, in, his, place, as, satrap, of, bactria, due, to, a, remarkable, physical, resemblance, two, of, cambyses, confidants, then, conspired, to, usurp, cambyses, and, put, sphendadates, on, the, throne, under, the, guise, of, bardiya, according, to, the, behistun, inscription, written, by, the, following, king, darius, the, great, a, magus, named, gaumata, impersonated, bardiya, and, incited, a, revolution, in, persia, whatever, the, exact, circumstances, of, the, revolt, cambyses, heard, news, of, it, in, the, summer, of, 522, bc, and, began, to, return, from, egypt, but, he, was, wounded, in, the, thigh, in, syria, and, died, of, gangrene, so, bardiya, s, impersonator, became, king, the, account, of, darius, is, the, earliest, and, although, the, later, historians, all, agree, on, the, key, details, of, the, story, that, a, magus, impersonated, bardiya, and, took, the, throne, this, may, have, been, a, story, created, by, darius, to, justify, his, own, usurpation, iranologist, pierre, briant, hypothesises, that, bardiya, was, not, killed, by, cambyses, but, waited, until, his, death, in, the, summer, of, 522, bc, to, claim, his, legitimate, right, to, the, throne, as, he, was, then, the, only, male, descendant, of, the, royal, family, briant, says, that, although, the, hypothesis, of, a, deception, by, darius, is, generally, accepted, today, nothing, has, been, established, with, certainty, at, the, present, time, given, the, available, evidence, according, to, the, behistun, inscription, gaumata, ruled, for, seven, months, before, being, overthrown, in, 522, bc, by, darius, the, great, old, persian, d, ryavu, who, holds, firm, the, good, also, known, as, darayarahush, the, magi, though, persecuted, continued, to, exist, and, a, year, following, the, death, of, the, first, pseudo, smerdis, gaumata, saw, a, second, pseudo, smerdis, vahyazd, ta, attempt, a, coup, the, coup, though, initially, successful, failed, herodotus, writes, that, the, native, leadership, debated, the, best, form, of, government, for, the, empire, ever, since, the, macedonian, king, amyntas, i, surrendered, his, country, to, the, persians, in, about, 512, 511, macedonians, and, persians, were, strangers, no, more, as, well, the, subjugation, of, macedonia, was, part, of, persian, military, operations, initiated, by, darius, the, great, 521, 486, in, 513, after, immense, preparations, a, huge, achaemenid, army, invaded, the, balkans, and, tried, to, defeat, the, european, scythians, roaming, to, the, north, of, the, danube, river, darius, army, subjugated, several, thracian, people, and, virtually, all, other, regions, that, touch, the, european, part, of, the, black, sea, such, as, parts, of, modern, bulgaria, romania, ukraine, and, russia, before, it, returned, to, asia, minor, darius, left, in, europe, one, of, his, commanders, named, megabazus, whose, task, was, to, accomplish, conquests, in, the, balkans, the, persian, troops, subjugated, gold, rich, thrace, the, coastal, greek, cities, and, defeated, and, conquered, the, powerful, paeonians, finally, megabazus, sent, envoys, to, amyntas, demanding, acceptance, of, persian, domination, which, the, macedonians, did, the, balkans, provided, many, soldiers, for, the, multi, ethnic, achaemenid, army, many, of, the, macedonian, and, persian, elite, intermarried, such, as, the, persian, official, bubares, who, married, amyntas, daughter, gygaea, family, ties, that, the, macedonian, rulers, amyntas, and, alexander, enjoyed, with, bubares, ensured, them, good, relations, with, the, persian, kings, darius, and, xerxes, i, who, was, also, known, as, xerxes, the, great, the, persian, invasion, led, indirectly, to, macedonia, s, rise, in, power, and, persia, had, some, common, interests, in, the, balkans, with, persian, aid, the, macedonians, stood, to, gain, much, at, the, expense, of, some, balkan, tribes, such, as, the, paeonians, and, greeks, all, in, all, the, macedonians, were, willing, and, useful, persian, allies, macedonian, soldiers, fought, against, athens, and, sparta, in, xerxes, i, s, army, the, persians, referred, to, both, greeks, and, macedonians, as, yauna, ionians, their, term, for, greeks, and, to, macedonians, specifically, as, yaun, takabara, or, greeks, with, hats, that, look, like, shields, possibly, referring, to, the, macedonian, kausia, hat, by, the, 5th, century, bc, the, kings, of, persia, were, either, ruling, over, or, had, subordinated, territories, encompassing, not, just, all, of, the, persian, plateau, and, all, of, the, territories, formerly, held, by, the, assyrian, empire, mesopotamia, the, levant, cyprus, and, egypt, but, beyond, this, all, of, anatolia, and, armenia, as, well, as, the, southern, caucasus, and, parts, of, the, north, caucasus, azerbaijan, uzbekistan, tajikistan, bulgaria, paeonia, thrace, and, macedonia, to, the, north, and, west, most, of, the, black, sea, coastal, regions, parts, of, central, asia, as, far, as, the, aral, sea, the, oxus, and, jaxartes, to, the, north, and, north, east, the, hindu, kush, and, the, western, indus, basin, corresponding, to, modern, afghanistan, and, pakistan, to, the, far, east, parts, of, northern, arabia, to, the, south, and, parts, of, eastern, libya, cyrenaica, to, the, south, west, and, parts, of, oman, china, and, the, uae, the, ionian, revolt, in, 499, bc, and, associated, revolts, in, aeolis, doris, cyprus, and, caria, were, military, rebellions, by, several, regions, of, asia, minor, against, persian, rule, lasting, from, 499, to, 493, bc, at, the, heart, of, the, rebellion, was, the, dissatisfaction, of, the, greek, cities, of, asia, minor, with, the, tyrants, appointed, by, persia, to, rule, them, along, with, the, individual, actions, of, two, milesian, tyrants, histiaeus, and, aristagoras, in, 499, bc, the, then, tyrant, of, miletus, aristagoras, launched, a, joint, expedition, with, the, persian, satrap, artaphernes, to, conquer, naxos, in, an, attempt, to, bolster, his, position, in, miletus, both, financially, and, in, terms, of, prestige, the, mission, was, a, debacle, and, sensing, his, imminent, removal, as, a, tyrant, aristagoras, chose, to, incite, the, whole, of, ionia, into, rebellion, against, the, persian, king, darius, i, who, was, commonly, known, as, darius, the, great, the, persians, continued, to, reduce, the, cities, along, the, west, coast, that, still, held, out, against, them, before, finally, imposing, a, peace, settlement, in, 493, bc, on, ionia, that, was, generally, considered, to, be, both, just, and, fair, the, ionian, revolt, constituted, the, first, major, conflict, between, greece, and, the, achaemenid, empire, and, as, such, represents, the, first, phase, of, the, greco, persian, wars, asia, minor, had, been, brought, back, into, the, persian, fold, but, darius, had, vowed, to, punish, athens, and, eretria, for, their, support, of, the, revolt, moreover, seeing, that, the, political, situation, in, greece, posed, a, continued, threat, to, the, stability, of, his, empire, he, decided, to, embark, on, the, conquest, of, all, of, greece, the, first, campaign, of, the, invasion, was, to, bring, the, territories, in, the, balkan, peninsula, back, within, the, empire, the, persian, grip, over, these, territories, had, loosened, following, the, ionian, revolt, in, 492, bc, the, persian, general, mardonius, re, subjugated, thrace, and, made, macedonia, a, fully, subordinate, part, of, the, empire, it, had, been, a, vassal, as, early, as, the, late, 6th, century, bc, but, retained, a, great, deal, of, autonomy, however, in, 490, bc, the, persian, forces, were, defeated, by, the, athenians, at, the, battle, of, marathon, and, darius, i, would, die, before, having, the, chance, to, launch, an, invasion, of, greece, xerxes, i, 485, 465, bc, old, persian, x, ay, r, a, hero, among, kings, son, of, darius, i, vowed, to, complete, the, job, he, organized, a, massive, invasion, aiming, to, conquer, greece, his, army, entered, greece, from, the, north, in, the, spring, of, 480, bc, meeting, little, or, no, resistance, through, macedonia, and, thessaly, but, was, delayed, by, a, small, greek, force, for, three, days, at, thermopylae, a, simultaneous, naval, battle, at, artemisium, was, tactically, indecisive, as, large, storms, destroyed, ships, from, both, sides, the, battle, was, stopped, prematurely, when, the, greeks, received, news, of, the, defeat, at, thermopylae, and, retreated, the, battle, was, a, tactical, victory, for, the, persians, giving, them, uncontested, control, of, artemisium, and, the, aegean, sea, following, his, victory, at, the, battle, of, thermopylae, xerxes, sacked, the, evacuated, city, of, athens, and, prepared, to, meet, the, greeks, at, the, strategic, isthmus, of, corinth, and, the, saronic, gulf, in, 480, bc, the, greeks, won, a, decisive, victory, over, the, persian, fleet, at, the, battle, of, salamis, and, forced, xerxes, to, retire, to, sardis, the, land, army, which, he, left, in, greece, under, mardonius, retook, athens, but, was, eventually, destroyed, in, 479, bc, at, the, battle, of, plataea, the, final, defeat, of, the, persians, at, mycale, encouraged, the, greek, cities, of, asia, to, revolt, and, the, persians, lost, all, of, their, territories, in, europe, with, macedonia, once, again, becoming, independent, artabanus, the, commander, of, the, royal, bodyguard, and, the, most, powerful, official, in, the, persian, court, assassinated, xerxes, with, the, help, of, a, eunuch, aspamitres, the, exact, year, and, date, of, xerxes, assassination, is, disputed, among, historians, after, xerxes, i, was, assassinated, he, was, succeeded, by, his, eldest, surviving, son, artaxerxes, i, it, was, during, his, reign, that, elamite, ceased, to, be, the, language, of, government, and, aramaic, gained, in, importance, it, was, probably, during, this, reign, that, the, solar, calendar, was, introduced, as, the, national, calendar, under, artaxerxes, i, zoroastrianism, became, the, de, facto, religion, of, the, empire, after, persia, had, been, defeated, at, the, battle, of, eurymedon, 469, or, 466, bc, military, action, between, greece, and, persia, was, halted, when, artaxerxes, i, took, power, he, introduced, a, new, persian, strategy, of, weakening, the, athenians, by, funding, their, enemies, in, greece, this, indirectly, caused, the, athenians, to, move, the, treasury, of, the, delian, league, from, the, island, of, delos, to, the, athenian, acropolis, this, funding, practice, inevitably, prompted, renewed, fighting, in, 450, bc, where, the, greeks, attacked, at, the, battle, of, cyprus, after, cimon, s, failure, to, attain, much, in, this, expedition, the, peace, of, callias, was, agreed, between, athens, argos, and, persia, in, 449, bc, artaxerxes, offered, asylum, to, themistocles, who, was, the, winner, of, the, battle, of, salamis, after, themistocles, was, ostracized, from, athens, also, artaxerxes, gave, him, magnesia, myus, and, lampsacus, to, maintain, him, in, bread, meat, and, wine, in, addition, artaxerxes, i, gave, him, palaescepsis, to, provide, him, with, clothes, and, he, also, gave, him, percote, with, bedding, for, his, house, when, artaxerxes, died, in, 424, bc, at, susa, his, body, was, taken, to, the, tomb, already, built, for, him, in, the, naqsh, e, rustam, necropolis, it, was, persian, tradition, that, kings, begin, constructing, their, own, tombs, while, they, were, still, alive, artaxerxes, i, was, immediately, succeeded, by, his, eldest, and, only, legitimate, son, xerxes, ii, however, after, a, few, days, on, the, throne, he, was, assassinated, while, drunk, by, pharnacyas, and, menostanes, on, the, orders, of, his, illegitimate, brother, sogdianus, who, apparently, had, gained, the, support, of, his, regions, sogdianus, reigned, for, six, months, and, fifteen, days, before, being, captured, by, his, half, brother, ochus, who, had, rebelled, against, him, sogdianus, was, executed, by, being, suffocated, in, ash, because, ochus, had, promised, he, would, not, die, by, the, sword, by, poison, or, by, hunger, ochus, then, took, the, royal, name, darius, ii, darius, ability, to, defend, his, position, on, the, throne, ended, the, short, power, vacuum, from, 412, bc, darius, ii, at, the, insistence, of, tissaphernes, gave, support, first, to, athens, then, to, sparta, but, in, 407, bc, darius, son, cyrus, the, younger, was, appointed, to, replace, tissaphernes, and, aid, was, given, entirely, to, sparta, which, finally, defeated, athens, in, 404, bc, in, the, same, year, darius, fell, ill, and, died, in, babylon, his, death, gave, an, egyptian, rebel, named, amyrtaeus, the, opportunity, to, throw, off, persian, control, over, egypt, at, his, death, bed, darius, babylonian, wife, parysatis, pleaded, with, him, to, have, her, second, eldest, son, cyrus, the, younger, crowned, but, darius, refused, queen, parysatis, favoured, cyrus, more, than, her, eldest, son, artaxerxes, ii, plutarch, relates, probably, on, the, authority, of, ctesias, that, the, displaced, tissaphernes, came, to, the, new, king, on, his, coronation, day, to, warn, him, that, his, younger, brother, cyrus, the, younger, was, preparing, to, assassinate, him, during, the, ceremony, artaxerxes, had, cyrus, arrested, and, would, have, had, him, executed, if, their, mother, parysatis, had, not, intervened, cyrus, was, then, sent, back, as, satrap, of, lydia, where, he, prepared, an, armed, rebellion, cyrus, assembled, a, large, army, including, a, contingent, of, ten, thousand, greek, mercenaries, and, made, his, way, deeper, into, persia, the, army, of, cyrus, was, stopped, by, the, royal, persian, army, of, artaxerxes, ii, at, cunaxa, in, 401, bc, where, cyrus, was, killed, the, ten, thousand, greek, mercenaries, including, xenophon, were, now, deep, in, persian, territory, and, were, at, risk, of, attack, so, they, searched, for, others, to, offer, their, services, to, but, eventually, had, to, return, to, greece, artaxerxes, ii, was, the, longest, reigning, of, the, achaemenid, kings, and, it, was, during, this, 45, year, period, of, relative, peace, and, stability, that, many, of, the, monuments, of, the, era, were, constructed, artaxerxes, moved, the, capital, back, to, persepolis, which, he, greatly, extended, also, the, summer, capital, at, ecbatana, was, lavishly, extended, with, gilded, columns, and, roof, tiles, of, silver, and, copper, the, extraordinary, innovation, of, the, zoroastrian, shrines, can, also, be, dated, to, his, reign, and, it, was, probably, during, this, period, that, zoroastrianism, spread, from, armenia, throughout, asia, minor, and, the, levant, the, construction, of, temples, though, serving, a, religious, purpose, was, not, a, purely, selfless, act, as, they, also, served, as, an, important, source, of, income, from, the, babylonian, kings, the, achaemenids, adopted, the, concept, of, a, mandatory, temple, tax, a, one, tenth, tithe, which, all, inhabitants, paid, to, the, temple, nearest, to, their, land, or, another, source, of, income, artaxerxes, ii, became, involved, in, a, war, with, persia, s, erstwhile, allies, the, spartans, who, under, agesilaus, ii, invaded, asia, minor, to, redirect, the, spartans, attention, to, greek, affairs, artaxerxes, ii, subsidized, their, enemies, in, particular, the, athenians, thebans, and, corinthians, these, subsidies, helped, to, engage, the, spartans, in, what, would, become, known, as, the, corinthian, war, in, 387, bc, artaxerxes, ii, betrayed, his, allies, and, came, to, an, arrangement, with, sparta, and, in, the, treaty, of, antalcidas, he, forced, his, erstwhile, allies, to, come, to, terms, this, treaty, restored, control, of, the, greek, cities, of, ionia, and, aeolis, on, the, anatolian, coast, to, the, persians, while, giving, sparta, dominance, on, the, greek, mainland, in, 385, bc, he, campaigned, against, the, cadusians, although, successful, against, the, greeks, artaxerxes, ii, had, more, trouble, with, the, egyptians, who, had, successfully, revolted, against, him, at, the, beginning, of, his, reign, an, attempt, to, reconquer, egypt, in, 373, bc, was, completely, unsuccessful, but, in, his, waning, years, the, persians, did, manage, to, defeat, a, joint, egyptian, spartan, effort, to, conquer, phoenicia, he, quashed, the, revolt, of, the, satraps, in, 372, 362, bc, he, is, reported, to, have, had, a, number, of, wives, his, main, wife, was, stateira, until, she, was, poisoned, by, artaxerxes, ii, s, mother, parysatis, in, about, 400, bc, another, chief, wife, was, a, greek, woman, of, phocaea, named, aspasia, not, the, same, as, the, concubine, of, pericles, artaxerxes, ii, is, said, to, have, had, more, than, 115, sons, from, 350, wives, in, 358, bc, artaxerxes, ii, died, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, artaxerxes, iii, in, 355, bc, artaxerxes, iii, forced, athens, to, conclude, a, peace, which, required, the, city, s, forces, to, leave, asia, minor, and, to, acknowledge, the, independence, of, its, rebellious, allies, artaxerxes, started, a, campaign, against, the, rebellious, cadusians, but, he, managed, to, appease, both, of, the, cadusian, kings, one, individual, who, successfully, emerged, from, this, campaign, was, darius, codomannus, who, later, occupied, the, persian, throne, as, darius, iii, artaxerxes, iii, then, ordered, the, disbanding, of, all, the, satrapal, armies, of, asia, minor, as, he, felt, that, they, could, no, longer, guarantee, peace, in, the, west, and, was, concerned, that, these, armies, equipped, the, western, satraps, with, the, means, to, revolt, the, order, was, however, ignored, by, artabazos, ii, of, phrygia, who, asked, for, the, help, of, athens, in, a, rebellion, against, the, king, athens, sent, assistance, to, sardis, orontes, of, mysia, also, supported, artabazos, and, the, combined, forces, managed, to, defeat, the, forces, sent, by, artaxerxes, iii, in, 354, bc, however, in, 353, bc, they, were, defeated, by, artaxerxes, iii, s, army, and, were, disbanded, orontes, was, pardoned, by, the, king, while, artabazos, fled, to, the, safety, of, the, court, of, philip, ii, of, macedon, in, c, 351, bc, artaxerxes, embarked, on, a, campaign, to, recover, egypt, which, had, revolted, under, his, father, artaxerxes, ii, at, the, same, time, a, rebellion, had, broken, out, in, asia, minor, which, being, supported, by, thebes, threatened, to, become, serious, levying, a, vast, army, artaxerxes, invaded, egypt, and, engaged, in, fighting, with, nectanebo, ii, after, a, year, of, fighting, the, egyptian, pharaoh, nectanebo, inflicted, a, crushing, defeat, on, the, persians, with, the, support, of, mercenaries, led, by, the, greek, generals, diophantus, and, lamius, artaxerxes, was, compelled, to, retreat, and, postpone, his, plans, to, reconquer, egypt, soon, after, this, defeat, there, were, rebellions, in, phoenicia, asia, minor, and, cyprus, in, 343, bc, artaxerxes, committed, responsibility, for, the, suppression, of, the, cyprian, rebels, to, idrieus, prince, of, caria, who, employed, 8, 000, greek, mercenaries, and, forty, triremes, commanded, by, phocion, the, athenian, and, evagoras, son, of, the, elder, evagoras, the, cypriot, monarch, idrieus, succeeded, in, reducing, cyprus, artaxerxes, initiated, a, counter, offensive, against, sidon, by, commanding, belesys, satrap, of, syria, and, mazaeus, satrap, of, cilicia, to, invade, the, city, and, to, keep, the, phoenicians, in, check, both, satraps, suffered, crushing, defeats, at, the, hands, of, tennes, the, sidonese, king, who, was, aided, by, 40, 000, greek, mercenaries, sent, to, him, by, nectanebo, ii, and, commanded, by, mentor, of, rhodes, as, a, result, the, persian, forces, were, driven, out, of, phoenicia, after, this, artaxerxes, personally, led, an, army, of, 330, 000, men, against, sidon, artaxerxes, army, comprised, 300, 000, foot, soldiers, 30, 000, cavalry, 300, triremes, and, 500, transports, or, provision, ships, after, gathering, this, army, he, sought, assistance, from, the, greeks, though, refused, aid, by, athens, and, sparta, he, succeeded, in, obtaining, a, thousand, theban, heavy, armed, hoplites, under, lacrates, three, thousand, argives, under, nicostratus, and, six, thousand, olians, ionians, and, dorians, from, the, greek, cities, of, asia, minor, this, greek, support, was, numerically, small, amounting, to, no, more, than, 10, 000, men, but, it, formed, together, with, the, greek, mercenaries, from, egypt, who, went, over, to, him, afterward, the, force, on, which, he, placed, his, chief, reliance, and, to, which, the, ultimate, success, of, his, expedition, was, mainly, due, the, approach, of, artaxerxes, sufficiently, weakened, the, resolution, of, tennes, that, he, endeavoured, to, purchase, his, own, pardon, by, delivering, up, 100, principal, citizens, of, sidon, into, the, hands, of, the, persian, king, and, then, admitting, artaxerxes, within, the, defences, of, the, town, artaxerxes, had, the, 100, citizens, transfixed, with, javelins, and, when, 500, more, came, out, as, supplicants, to, seek, his, mercy, artaxerxes, consigned, them, to, the, same, fate, sidon, was, then, burnt, to, the, ground, either, by, artaxerxes, or, by, the, sidonian, citizens, forty, thousand, people, died, in, the, conflagration, artaxerxes, sold, the, ruins, at, a, high, price, to, speculators, who, calculated, on, reimbursing, themselves, by, the, treasures, which, they, hoped, to, dig, out, from, among, the, ashes, tennes, was, later, put, to, death, by, artaxerxes, artaxerxes, later, sent, jews, who, supported, the, revolt, to, hyrcania, on, the, south, coast, of, the, caspian, sea, the, reduction, of, sidon, was, followed, closely, by, the, invasion, of, egypt, in, 343, bc, artaxerxes, iii, in, addition, to, his, 330, 000, persians, had, now, a, force, of, 14, 000, greeks, furnished, by, the, greek, cities, of, asia, minor, 4, 000, under, mentor, consisting, of, the, troops, that, he, had, brought, to, the, aid, of, tennes, from, egypt, 3, 000, sent, by, argos, and, 1, 000, from, thebes, he, divided, these, troops, into, three, bodies, and, placed, at, the, head, of, each, a, persian, and, a, greek, the, greek, commanders, were, lacrates, of, thebes, mentor, of, rhodes, and, nicostratus, of, argos, while, the, persians, were, led, by, rhossaces, aristazanes, and, bagoas, the, chief, of, the, eunuchs, nectanebo, ii, resisted, with, an, army, of, 100, 000, of, whom, 20, 000, were, greek, mercenaries, nectanebo, ii, occupied, the, nile, and, its, various, branches, with, his, large, navy, the, character, of, the, country, intersected, by, numerous, canals, and, full, of, strongly, fortified, towns, was, in, his, favour, and, nectanebo, ii, might, have, been, expected, to, offer, a, prolonged, if, not, even, a, successful, resistance, however, he, lacked, good, generals, and, over, confident, in, his, own, powers, of, command, he, was, out, maneuvered, by, the, greek, mercenary, generals, and, his, forces, were, eventually, defeated, by, the, combined, persian, armies, after, his, defeat, nectanebo, hastily, fled, to, memphis, leaving, the, fortified, towns, to, be, defended, by, their, garrisons, these, garrisons, consisted, of, partly, greek, and, partly, egyptian, troops, between, whom, jealousies, and, suspicions, were, easily, sown, by, the, persian, leaders, as, a, result, the, persians, were, able, to, rapidly, reduce, numerous, towns, across, lower, egypt, and, were, advancing, upon, memphis, when, nectanebo, decided, to, quit, the, country, and, flee, southwards, to, ethiopia, the, persian, army, completely, routed, the, egyptians, and, occupied, the, lower, delta, of, the, nile, following, nectanebo, fleeing, to, ethiopia, all, of, egypt, submitted, to, artaxerxes, the, jews, in, egypt, were, sent, either, to, babylon, or, to, the, south, coast, of, the, caspian, sea, the, same, location, that, the, jews, of, phoenicia, had, earlier, been, sent, after, this, victory, over, the, egyptians, artaxerxes, had, the, city, walls, destroyed, started, a, reign, of, terror, and, set, about, looting, all, the, temples, persia, gained, a, significant, amount, of, wealth, from, this, looting, artaxerxes, also, raised, high, taxes, and, attempted, to, weaken, egypt, enough, that, it, could, never, revolt, against, persia, for, the, 10, years, that, persia, controlled, egypt, believers, in, the, native, religion, were, persecuted, and, sacred, books, were, stolen, before, artaxerxes, returned, to, persia, he, appointed, pherendares, as, satrap, of, egypt, with, the, wealth, gained, from, his, reconquering, egypt, artaxerxes, was, able, to, amply, reward, his, mercenaries, he, then, returned, to, his, capital, having, successfully, completed, his, invasion, of, egypt, after, his, success, in, egypt, artaxerxes, returned, to, persia, and, spent, the, next, few, years, effectively, quelling, insurrections, in, various, parts, of, the, empire, so, that, a, few, years, after, his, conquest, of, egypt, the, persian, empire, was, firmly, under, his, control, egypt, remained, a, part, of, the, persian, empire, from, then, until, alexander, the, great, s, conquest, of, egypt, after, the, conquest, of, egypt, there, were, no, more, revolts, or, rebellions, against, artaxerxes, mentor, and, bagoas, the, two, generals, who, had, most, distinguished, themselves, in, the, egyptian, campaign, were, advanced, to, posts, of, the, highest, importance, mentor, who, was, governor, of, the, entire, asiatic, seaboard, was, successful, in, reducing, to, subjection, many, of, the, chiefs, who, during, the, recent, troubles, had, rebelled, against, persian, rule, in, the, course, of, a, few, years, mentor, and, his, forces, were, able, to, bring, the, whole, asian, mediterranean, coast, into, complete, submission, and, dependence, bagoas, went, back, to, the, persian, capital, with, artaxerxes, where, he, took, a, leading, role, in, the, internal, administration, of, the, empire, and, maintained, tranquillity, throughout, the, rest, of, the, empire, during, the, last, six, years, of, the, reign, of, artaxerxes, iii, the, persian, empire, was, governed, by, a, vigorous, and, successful, government, the, persian, forces, in, ionia, and, lycia, regained, control, of, the, aegean, and, the, mediterranean, sea, and, took, over, much, of, athens, former, island, empire, in, response, isocrates, of, athens, started, giving, speeches, calling, for, a, crusade, against, the, barbarians, but, there, was, not, enough, strength, left, in, any, of, the, greek, city, states, to, answer, his, call, although, there, were, no, rebellions, in, the, persian, empire, itself, the, growing, power, and, territory, of, philip, ii, of, macedon, in, macedon, against, which, demosthenes, was, in, vain, warning, the, athenians, attracted, the, attention, of, artaxerxes, in, response, he, ordered, that, persian, influence, was, to, be, used, to, check, and, constrain, the, rising, power, and, influence, of, the, macedonian, kingdom, in, 340, bc, a, persian, force, was, dispatched, to, assist, the, thracian, prince, cersobleptes, to, maintain, his, independence, sufficient, effective, aid, was, given, to, the, city, of, perinthus, that, the, numerous, and, well, appointed, army, with, which, philip, had, commenced, his, siege, of, the, city, was, compelled, to, give, up, the, attempt, by, the, last, year, of, artaxerxes, rule, philip, ii, already, had, plans, in, place, for, an, invasion, of, the, persian, empire, which, would, crown, his, career, but, the, greeks, would, not, unite, with, him, in, 338, bc, artaxerxes, was, poisoned, by, bagoas, with, the, assistance, of, a, physician, artaxerxes, iii, was, succeeded, by, artaxerxes, iv, arses, who, before, he, could, act, was, also, poisoned, by, bagoas, bagoas, is, further, said, to, have, killed, not, only, all, arses, children, but, many, of, the, other, princes, of, the, land, bagoas, then, placed, darius, iii, a, nephew, of, artaxerxes, iv, on, the, throne, darius, iii, previously, the, satrap, of, armenia, personally, forced, bagoas, to, swallow, poison, in, 334, bc, when, darius, was, just, succeeding, in, subduing, egypt, again, alexander, and, his, battle, hardened, troops, invaded, asia, minor, alexander, the, great, alexander, iii, of, macedon, defeated, the, persian, armies, at, granicus, 334, bc, followed, by, issus, 333, bc, and, lastly, at, gaugamela, 331, bc, afterwards, he, marched, on, susa, and, persepolis, which, surrendered, in, early, 330, bc, from, persepolis, alexander, headed, north, to, pasargadae, where, he, visited, the, tomb, of, cyrus, the, man, whom, he, had, heard, of, from, the, cyropaedia, in, the, ensuing, chaos, created, by, alexander, s, invasion, of, persia, cyrus, s, tomb, was, broken, into, and, most, of, its, luxuries, were, looted, when, alexander, reached, the, tomb, he, was, horrified, by, the, manner, in, which, it, had, been, treated, and, questioned, the, magi, putting, them, on, trial, by, some, accounts, alexander, s, decision, to, put, the, magi, on, trial, was, more, an, attempt, to, undermine, their, influence, and, display, his, own, power, than, a, show, of, concern, for, cyrus, s, tomb, regardless, alexander, the, great, ordered, aristobulus, to, improve, the, tomb, s, condition, and, restore, its, interior, showing, respect, for, cyrus, from, there, he, headed, to, ecbatana, where, darius, iii, had, sought, refuge, darius, iii, was, taken, prisoner, by, bessus, his, bactrian, satrap, and, kinsman, as, alexander, approached, bessus, had, his, men, murder, darius, iii, and, then, declared, himself, darius, successor, as, artaxerxes, v, before, retreating, into, central, asia, leaving, darius, body, in, the, road, to, delay, alexander, who, brought, it, to, persepolis, for, an, honourable, funeral, bessus, would, then, create, a, coalition, of, his, forces, to, create, an, army, to, defend, against, alexander, before, bessus, could, fully, unite, with, his, confederates, at, the, eastern, part, of, the, empire, alexander, fearing, the, danger, of, bessus, gaining, control, found, him, put, him, on, trial, in, a, persian, court, under, his, control, and, ordered, his, execution, in, a, cruel, and, barbarous, manner, alexander, generally, kept, the, original, achaemenid, administrative, structure, leading, some, scholars, to, dub, him, as, the, last, of, the, achaemenids, upon, alexander, s, death, in, 323, bc, his, empire, was, divided, among, his, generals, the, diadochi, resulting, in, a, number, of, smaller, states, the, largest, of, these, which, held, sway, over, the, iranian, plateau, was, the, seleucid, empire, ruled, by, alexander, s, general, seleucus, i, nicator, native, iranian, rule, would, be, restored, by, the, parthians, of, northeastern, iran, over, the, course, of, the, 2nd, century, bc, through, the, parthian, empire, several, later, persian, rulers, forming, the, frataraka, dynasty, are, known, to, have, acted, as, representatives, of, the, seleucids, in, the, region, of, f, rs, they, ruled, from, the, end, of, the, 3rd, century, bc, to, the, beginning, of, the, 2nd, century, bc, and, vahbarz, or, v, dfrad, d, i, obtained, independence, c, 150, bc, when, seleucid, power, waned, in, the, areas, of, southwestern, persia, and, the, persian, gulf, region, during, an, apparent, transitional, period, corresponding, to, the, reigns, of, v, dfrad, d, ii, and, another, uncertain, king, no, titles, of, authority, appeared, on, the, reverse, of, their, coins, the, earlier, title, prtrk, zy, alhaya, frataraka, had, disappeared, under, d, r, v, i, darios, i, however, the, new, title, of, mlk, or, king, appeared, sometimes, with, the, mention, of, prs, persis, suggesting, that, the, kings, of, persis, had, become, independent, rulers, when, the, parthian, arsacid, king, mithridates, i, c, 171, 138, bc, took, control, of, persis, he, left, the, persian, dynasts, in, office, known, as, the, kings, of, persis, and, they, were, allowed, to, continue, minting, coins, with, the, title, of, mlk, king, with, the, reign, of, buhr, the, son, of, p, pag, the, kingdom, of, persis, then, became, a, part, of, the, sasanian, empire, buhr, s, brother, and, successor, ardax, ir, artaxerxes, v,

sasanian, empire, the, achaemenid, line, would, also, be, carried, on, through, the, kingdom, of, pontus, based, in, the, pontus, region, of, northern, asia, minor, this, pontic, kingdom, a, state, of, persian, origin, may, even, have, been, directly, related, to, darius, i, and, the, achaemenid, dynasty, it, was, founded, by, mithridates, i, in, 281, bc, and, lasted, until, its, conquest, by, the, roman, republic, in, 63, bc, the, kingdom, grew, to, its, largest, extent, under, mithridates, vi, the, great, who, conquered, colchis, cappadocia, bithynia, the, greek, colonies, of, the, tauric, chersonesos, and, for, a, brief, time, the, roman, province, of, asia, thus, this, persian, dynasty, managed, to, survive, and, prosper, in, the, hellenistic, world, while, the, main, persian, empire, had, fallen, despite, greek, influence, on, the, kingdom, of, pontus, pontics, continued, to, maintain, their, achaemenid, lineage, both, the, later, dynasties, of, the, parthians, and, sasanians, would, on, occasion, claim, achaemenid, descent, recently, there, has, been, some, corroboration, for, the, parthian, claim, to, achaemenid, ancestry, via, the, possibility, of, an, inherited, disease, neurofibromatosis, demonstrated, by, the, physical, descriptions, of, rulers, and, from, the, evidence, of, familial, disease, on, ancient, coinage, cyrus, the, great, founded,

bimetallic, monetary, standard, of, the, achaemenids, which, has, continued, until, today, this, was, accomplished, by, darius, i, who, reinforced, the, empire, and, expanded, persepolis, as, a, ceremonial, capital, he, revolutionized, the, economy, by, placing, it, on, the, silver, and, gold, coinage, darius, also, introduced, a, regulated, and, sustainable, tax, system, that, was, precisely, tailored, to, each, satrapy, based, on, their, supposed, productivity, and, their, economic, potential, for, instance, babylon, was, assessed, for, the, highest, amount, and, for, a, startling, mixture, of, commodities, 1, 000, silver, talents, four, months, supply, of, food, for, the, army, india, was, clearly, already, fabled, for, its, gold, egypt, was, known, for, the, wealth, of, its, crops, it, was, to, be, the, granary, of, the, persian, empire, as, later, of, rome, s, and, was, required, to, provide, 120, 000, measures, of, grain, in, addition, to, 700, talents, of, silver, this, was, exclusively, a, tax, levied, on, subject, peoples, there, is, evidence, that, conquered, and, rebellious, enemies, could, be, sold, into, slavery, alongside, its, other, innovations, in, administration, and, taxation, the, achaemenids, may, have, been, the, first, government, in, the, ancient, near, east, to, register, private, slave, sales, and, tax, them, using, an, early, form, of, sales, tax, other, accomplishments, of, darius, reign, included, the, codification, of, the, d, ta, a, universal, legal, system, which, would, become, the, basis, of, later, iranian, law, and, the, construction, of, a, new, capital, at, persepolis, under, the, achaemenids, trade, was, extensive, and, there, was, an, efficient, infrastructure, that, facilitated, the, exchange, of, commodities, in, the, far, reaches, of, the, empire, tariffs, on, trade, along, with, agriculture, and, tribute, were, major, sources, of, revenue, for, the, empire, the, satrapies, were, linked, by, a, 2, 500, kilometer, highway, the, most, impressive, stretch, being, the, royal, road, from, susa, to, sardis, built, by, command, of, darius, i, it, featured, stations, and, caravanserais, at, specific, intervals, the, relays, of, mounted, couriers, the, angarium, could, reach, the, remotest, of, areas, in, fifteen, days, herodotus, observes, that, there, is, nothing, in, the, world, that, travels, faster, than, these, persian, couriers, neither, snow, nor, rain, nor, heat, nor, gloom, of, night, stays, these, courageous, couriers, from, the, swift, completion, of, their, appointed, rounds, despite, the, relative, local, independence, given, by, the, satrapy, system, royal, inspectors, the, eyes, and, ears, of, the, king, toured, the, empire, and, reported, on, local, conditions, another, highway, of, commerce, was, the, great, khorasan, road, an, informal, mercantile, route, that, originated, in, the, fertile, lowlands, of, mesopotamia, and, snaked, through, the, zagros, highlands, through, the, iranian, plateau, and, afghanistan, into, the, central, asian, regions, of, samarkand, merv, and, ferghana, allowing, for, the, construction, of, frontier, cities, like, cyropolis, following, alexander, s, conquests, this, highway, allowed, for, the, spread, of, cultural, syncretic, fusions, like, greco, buddhism, into, central, asia, and, china, as, well, as, empires, like, the, kushan, indo, greek, and, parthian, to, profit, from, trade, between, east, and, west, this, route, was, greatly, rehabilitated, and, formalized, during, the, abbasid, caliphate, during, which, it, developed, into, a, major, component, of, the, famed, silk, road, despite, its, humble, origins, in, persis, the, empire, reached, an, enormous, size, under, the, leadership, of, cyrus, the, great, cyrus, created, a, multi, state, empire, where, he, allowed, regional, rulers, satraps, to, rule, as, his, proxy, over, a, certain, designated, area, of, his, empire, called, a, satrapy, the, basic, rule, of, governance, was, based, upon, loyalty, and, obedience, of, each, satrapy, to, the, central, power, or, the, king, and, compliance, with, tax, laws, due, to, the, ethno, cultural, diversity, of, the, subject, nations, under, the, rule, of, persia, its, enormous, geographic, size, and, the, constant, struggle, for, power, by, regional, competitors, the, creation, of, a, professional, army, was, necessary, for, both, maintenance, of, the, peace, and, to, enforce, the, authority, of, the, king, in, cases, of, rebellion, and, foreign, threat, cyrus, managed, to, create, a, strong, land, army, using, it, to, advance, in, his, campaigns, in, babylonia, lydia, and, asia, minor, which, after, his, death, was, used, by, his, son, cambyses, ii, in, egypt, against, psamtik, iii, cyrus, would, die, battling, a, local, iranian, insurgency, in, the, empire, before, he, could, have, a, chance, to, develop, a, naval, force, that, task, would, fall, to, darius, i, who, would, officially, give, persians, their, own, royal, navy, to, allow, them, to, engage, their, enemies, on, multiple, seas, of, this, vast, empire, from, the, black, sea, and, the, aegean, sea, to, the, persian, gulf, ionian, sea, and, the, mediterranean, sea, the, empire, s, great, armies, were, like, the, empire, itself, very, diverse, having, persians, macedonians, european, thracians, paeonians, medes, achaean, greeks, cissians, hyrcanians, assyrians, chaldeans, bactrians, sacae, arians, parthians, caucasian, albanians, chorasmians, sogdians, gandarans, dadicae, caspians, sarangae,

perrhaebi, enienes, dolopes, and, magnesians, the, achaemenid, infantry, consisted, of, three, groups, the, immortals, the, sparabara, and, the, takabara, though, in, the, later, years, of, the, achaemenid, empire, a, fourth, group, the, cardaces, were, introduced, the, immortals, were, described, by, herodotus, as, being, heavy, infantry, led, by, hydarnes, ii, that, were, kept, constantly, at, a, strength, of, exactly, 10, 000, men, he, claimed, that, the, unit, s, name, stemmed, from, the, custom, that, every, killed, seriously, wounded, or, sick, member, was, immediately, replaced, with, a, new, one, maintaining, the, numbers, and, cohesion, of, the, unit, they, had, wicker, shields, short, spears, swords, or, large, daggers, and, bow, and, arrows, underneath, their, robes, they, wore, scale, armour, coats, the, spear, counterbalances, of, the, common, soldiery, were, of, silver, to, differentiate, commanding, ranks, the, officers, spear, butt, spikes, were, golden, surviving, achaemenid, colored, glazed, bricks, and, carved, reliefs, represent, the, immortals, as, wearing, elaborate, robes, hoop, earrings, and, gold, jewellery, though, these, garments, and, accessories, were, most, likely, worn, only, for, ceremonial, occasions, the, sparabara, were, usually, the, first, to, engage, in, hand, to, hand, combat, with, the, enemy, although, not, much, is, known, about, them, today, it, is, believed, that, they, were, the, backbone, of, the, persian, army, who, formed, a, shield, wall, and, used, their, two, metre, long, spears, to, protect, more, vulnerable, troops, such, as, archers, from, the, enemy, the, sparabara, were, taken, from, the, full, members, of, persian, society, were, trained, from, childhood, to, be, soldiers, and, when, not, called, out, to, fight, on, campaigns, in, distant, lands, they, practised, hunting, on, the, vast, plains, of, persia, however, when, all, was, quiet, and, the, pax, persica, held, true, the, sparabara, returned, to, normal, life, farming, the, land, and, grazing, their, herds, because, of, this, they, lacked, true, professional, quality, on, the, battlefield, yet, they, were, well, trained, and, courageous, to, the, point, of, holding, the, line, in, most, situations, long, enough, for, a, counter, attack, they, were, armoured, with, quilted, linen, and, carried, large, rectangular, wicker, shields, as, a, form, of, light, maneuverable, defence, this, however, left, them, at, a, severe, disadvantage, against, heavily, armoured, opponents, such, as, the, hoplite, and, their, two, metre, long, spear, was, not, able, to, give, the, sparabara, ample, range, to, plausibly, engage, a, trained, phalanx, the, wicker, shields, were, able, to, effectively, stop, arrows, but, not, strong, enough, to, protect, the, soldier, from, spears, however, the, sparabara, could, deal, with, most, other, infantry, including, trained, units, from, the, east, the, achaemenids, relied, heavily, on, archery, major, contributing, nations, were, the, scythians, medes, persians, and, the, elamites, the, composite, bow, was, used, by, the, persians, and, medes, who, adopted, it, from, the, scythians, and, transmitted, it, to, other, nations, including, the, greeks, achaemenid, armies, typically, used, socketed, three, bladed, also, known, as, trilobate, or, scythian, arrowheads, these, arrowheads, were, cast, from, leaded, tin, bronze, which, made, them, amenable, to, mass, production, unlike, the, wrought, iron, arrowheads, of, the, period, that, had, to, be, individually, forged, the, takabara, were, a, rare, unit, who, were, a, tough, type, of, peltasts, they, tended, to, fight, with, their, own, native, weapons, which, would, have, included, a, crescent, shaped, light, wickerwork, shield, and, axes, as, well, as, light, linen, cloth, and, leather, the, takabara, were, recruited, from, territories, that, incorporated, modern, iran, the, armoured, persian, horsemen, and, their, death, dealing, chariots, were, invincible, no, man, dared, face, them, the, persian, cavalry, was, crucial, for, conquering, nations, and, maintained, its, importance, in, the, achaemenid, army, to, the, last, days, of, the, achaemenid, empire, the, cavalry, was, separated, into, four, groups, the, chariot, archers, horse, cavalry, the, camel, cavalry, and, the, war, elephants, in, the, later, years, of, the, achaemenid, empire, the, chariot, archer, had, become, merely, a, ceremonial, part, of, the, persian, army, yet, in, the, early, years, of, the, empire, their, use, was, widespread, the, chariot, archers, were, armed, with, lances, bows, arrows, swords, and, scale, armour, the, horses, were, also, suited, with, scale, armour, similar, to, scale, armour, of, the, sassanian, cataphracts, the, chariots, would, contain, imperial, symbols, and, decorations, the, horses, used, by, the, achaemenids, for, cavalry, were, often, suited, with, scale, armour, like, most, cavalry, units, the, riders, often, had, the, same, armour, as, infantry, units, wicker, shields, short, spears, swords, or, large, daggers, bow, and, arrow, and, scale, armour, coats, the, camel, cavalry, was, different, because, the, camels, and, sometimes, the, riders, were, provided, little, protection, against, enemies, yet, when, they, were, offered, protection, they, would, have, lances, swords, bow, arrow, and, scale, armour, the, camel, cavalry, was, first, introduced, into, the, persian, army, by, cyrus, the, great, at, the, battle, of, thymbra, the, elephant, was, most, likely, introduced, into, the, persian, army, by, darius, i, after, his, conquest, of, the, indus, valley, elephants, may, have, been, used, in, greek, campaigns, by, darius, and, xerxes, i, but, greek, accounts, only, mention, 15, of, them, being, used, at, the, battle, of, gaugamela, since, its, foundation, by, cyrus, the, persian, empire, had, been, primarily, a, land, empire, with, a, strong, army, but, void, of, any, actual, naval, forces, by, the, 5th, century, bc, this, was, to, change, as, the, empire, came, across, greek, and, egyptian, forces, each, with, their, own, maritime, traditions, and, capabilities, darius, i, was, the, first, achaemenid, king, to, invest, in, a, persian, fleet, even, by, then, no, true, imperial, navy, had, existed, either, in, greece, or, egypt, persia, would, become, the, first, empire, under, darius, to, inaugurate, and, deploy, the, first, regular, imperial, navy, despite, this, achievement, the, personnel, for, the, imperial, navy, would, not, come, from, iran, but, were, often, phoenicians, mostly, from, sidon, egyptians, and, greeks, chosen, by, darius, the, great, to, operate, the, empire, s, combat, vessels, at, first, the, ships, were, built, in, sidon, by, the, phoenicians, the, first, achaemenid, ships, measured, about, 40, meters, in, length, and, 6, meters, in, width, able, to, transport, up, to, 300, persian, troops, at, any, one, trip, soon, other, states, of, the, empire, were, constructing, their, own, ships, each, incorporating, slight, local, preferences, the, ships, eventually, found, their, way, to, the, persian, gulf, and, persian, naval, forces, laid, the, foundation, for, a, strong, persian, maritime, presence, there, persians, also, had, ships, often, of, a, capacity, 100, to, 200, troops, patrolling, the, empire, s, various, rivers, including, the, karun, tigris, and, nile, in, the, west, as, well, as, the, indus, the, achaemenid, navy, established, bases, located, along, the, karun, and, in, bahrain, oman, and, yemen, the, persian, fleet, was, not, only, used, for, peace, keeping, purposes, along, the, karun, but, also, opened, the, door, to, trade, with, india, via, the, persian, gulf, darius, s, navy, was, in, many, ways, a, world, power, at, the, time, but, it, would, be, artaxerxes, ii, who, in, the, summer, of, 397, bc, would, build, a, formidable, navy, as, part, of, a, rearmament, which, would, lead, to, his, decisive, victory, at, knidos, in, 394, bc, re, establishing, achaemenid, power, in, ionia, artaxerxes, ii, would, also, use, his, navy, to, later, on, quell, a, rebellion, in, egypt, the, construction, material, of, choice, was, wood, but, some, armoured, achaemenid, ships, had, metallic, blades, on, the, front, often, meant, to, slice, enemy, ships, using, the, ship, s, momentum, naval, ships, were, also, equipped, with, hooks, on, the, side, to, grab, enemy, ships, or, to, negotiate, their, position, the, ships, were, propelled, by, sails, or, manpower, the, ships, the, persians, created, were, unique, as, far, as, maritime, engagement, the, ships, were, equipped, with, two, mangonels, that, would, launch, projectiles, such, as, stones, or, flammable, substances, xenophon, describes, his, eyewitness, account, of, a, massive, military, bridge, created, by, joining, 37, persian, ships, across, the, tigris, the, persians, used, each, boat, s, buoyancy, to, support, a, connected, bridge, above, which, supply, could, be, transferred, herodotus, also, gives, many, accounts, of, the, persians, using, ships, to, build, bridges, darius, i, in, an, attempt, to, subdue, the, scythian, horsemen, north, of, the, black, sea, crossed, over, at, the, bosphorus, using, an, enormous, bridge, made, by, connecting, achaemenid, boats, then, marched, up, to, the, danube, crossing, it, by, means, of, a, second, boat, bridge, the, bridge, over, the, bosphorus, essentially, connected, the, nearest, tip, of, asia, to, europe, encompassing, at, least, some, 1000, meters, of, open, water, if, not, more, herodotus, describes, the, spectacle, and, calls, it, the, bridge, of, darius, strait, called, bosphorus, across, which, the, bridge, of, darius, had, been, thrown, is, hundred, and, twenty, furlongs, in, length, reaching, from, the, euxine, to, the, propontis, the, propontis, is, five, hundred, furlongs, across, and, fourteen, hundred, long, its, waters, flow, into, the, hellespont, the, length, of, which, is, four, hundred, furlongs, years, later, a, similar, boat, bridge, would, be, constructed, by, xerxes, i, in, his, invasion, of, greece, although, the, persians, failed, to, capture, the, greek, city, states, completely, the, tradition, of, maritime, involvement, was, carried, down, by, the, persian, kings, most, notably, artaxerxes, ii, years, later, when, alexander, invaded, persia, and, during, his, advancement, into, india, he, took, a, page, from, the, persian, art, of, war, by, having, hephaestion, and, perdiccas, construct, a, similar, boat, bridge, at, the, indus, river, in, india, in, the, spring, of, 327, bc, during, the, reign, of, cyrus, ii, and, darius, i, and, as, long, as, the, seat, of, government, was, still, at, susa, in, elam, the, language, of, the, chancellery, was, elamite, this, is, primarily, attested, in, the, persepolis, fortification, and, treasury, tablets, that, reveal, details, of, the, day, to, day, functioning, of, the, empire, in, the, grand, rock, face, inscriptions, of, the, kings, the, elamite, texts, are, always, accompanied, by, akkadian, babylonian, dialect, and, old, persian, inscriptions, and, it, appears, that, in, these, cases, that, the, elamite, texts, are, translations, of, the, old, persian, ones, it, is, then, likely, that, although, elamite, was, used, by, the, capital, government, in, susa, it, was, not, a, standardized, language, of, government, everywhere, in, the, empire, the, use, of, elamite, is, not, attested, after, 458, bc, following, the, conquest, of, mesopotamia, the, aramaic, language, as, used, in, that, territory, was, adopted, as, a, vehicle, for, written, communication, between, the, different, regions, of, the, vast, empire, with, its, different, peoples, and, languages, the, use, of, a, single, official, language, which, modern, scholarship, has, dubbed, official, aramaic, or, imperial, aramaic, can, be, assumed, to, have, greatly, contributed, to, the, astonishing, success, of, the, achaemenids, in, holding, their, far, flung, empire, together, for, as, long, as, they, did, in, 1955, richard, frye, questioned, the, classification, of, imperial, aramaic, as, an, official, language, noting, that, no, surviving, edict, expressly, and, unambiguously, accorded, that, status, to, any, particular, language, frye, reclassifies, imperial, aramaic, as, the, lingua, franca, of, the, achaemenid, empire, suggesting, that, the, use, of, aramaic, language, in, achaemenid, empire, was, more, widespread, than, generally, thought, many, centuries, after, the, fall, of, the, empire, aramaic, script, and, as, ideograms, aramaic, vocabulary, would, survive, as, the, essential, characteristics, of, the, pahlavi, writing, system, although, old, persian, also, appears, on, some, seals, and, art, objects, that, language, is, attested, primarily, in, the, achaemenid, inscriptions, of, western, iran, suggesting, then, that, old, persian, was, the, common, language, of, that, region, however, by, the, reign, of, artaxerxes, ii, the, grammar, and, orthography, of, the, inscriptions, was, so, far, from, perfect, that, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, scribes, who, composed, those, texts, had, already, largely, forgotten, the, language, and, had, to, rely, on, older, inscriptions, which, they, to, a, great, extent, reproduced, verbatim, when, the, occasion, demanded, achaemenid, administrative, correspondence, was, conducted, in, greek, making, it, a, widely, used, bureaucratic, language, even, though, the, achaemenids, had, extensive, contacts, with, the, greeks, and, vice, versa, and, had, conquered, many, of, the, greek, speaking, areas, both, in, europe, and, asia, minor, during, different, periods, of, the, empire, the, native, old, iranian, sources, provide, no, indication, of, greek, linguistic, influence, however, there, is, plenty, of, evidence, in, addition, to, the, accounts, of, herodotus, that, greeks, apart, from, being, deployed, and, employed, in, the, core, regions, of, the, empire, also, evidently, lived, and, worked, in, the, heartland, of, the, achaemenid, empire, namely, iran, for, example, greeks, were, part, of, the, various, ethnicities, that, constructed, darius, palace, in, susa, apart, from, the, greek, inscriptions, found, nearby, there, and, one, short, persepolis, tablet, written, in, greek, herodotus, mentions, that, the, persians, were, invited, to, great, birthday, feasts, herodotus, histories, 8, which, would, be, followed, by, many, desserts, a, treat, which, they, reproached, the, greeks, for, omitting, from, their, meals, he, also, observed, that, the, persians, drank, wine, in, large, quantities, and, used, it, even, for, counsel, deliberating, on, important, affairs, when, drunk, and, deciding, the, next, day, when, sober, whether, to, act, on, the, decision, or, set, it, aside, mithra, was, worshipped, his, temples, and, symbols, were, the, most, widespread, most, people, bore, names, related, to, him, and, most, festivals, were, dedicated, to, him, religious, toleration, has, been, described, as, a, remarkable, feature, of, the, achaemenid, empire, the, old, testament, reports, that, persian, king, cyrus, the, great, released, the, jewish, people, from, the, babylonian, captivity, in, 539, 530, bc, and, permitted, them, to, return, to, their, homeland, cyrus, the, great, assisted, in, the, restoration, of, the, sacred, places, of, various, cities, it, was, during, the, achaemenid, period, that, zoroastrianism, reached, southwestern, iran, where, it, came, to, be, accepted, by, the, rulers, and, through, them, became, a, defining, element, of, persian, culture, the, religion, was, not, only, accompanied, by, a, formalization, of, the, concepts, and, divinities, of, the, traditional, iranian, pantheon, but, also, introduced, several, novel, ideas, including, that, of, free, will, during, the, reign, of, artaxerxes, i, and, darius, ii, the, greek, historian, herodotus, wrote, have, no, images, of, the, gods, no, temples, nor, altars, and, consider, the, use, of, them, a, sign, of, folly, this, comes, i, think, from, their, not, believing, the, gods, to, have, the, same, nature, with, men, as, the, greeks, imagine, he, claims, the, persians, offer, sacrifice, to, the, sun, and, moon, to, the, earth, to, fire, to, water, and, to, the, winds, these, are, the, only, gods, whose, worship, has, come, down, to, them, from, ancient, times, at, a, later, period, they, began, the, worship, of, urania, which, they, borrowed, from, the, arabians, and, assyrians, mylitta, is, the, name, by, which, the, assyrians, know, this, goddess, to, whom, the, persians, referred, as, anahita, the, babylonian, scholar, and, priest, berosus, records, although, writing, over, seventy, years, after, the, reign, of, artaxerxes, ii, that, the, emperor, had, been, the, first, to, make, cult, statues, of, divinities, and, have, them, placed, in, temples, in, many, of, the, major, cities, of, the, empire, berosus, also, substantiates, herodotus, when, he, says, the, persians, knew, of, no, images, of, gods, until, artaxerxes, ii, erected, those, images, on, the, means, of, sacrifice, herodotus, adds, they, raise, no, altar, light, no, fire, pour, no, libations, herodotus, also, observed, that, no, prayer, or, offering, can, be, made, without, a, magus, present, the, position, of, women, in, the, achaemenid, empire, differed, depending, on, which, culture, they, belonged, to, and, therefore, varied, depending, on, the, region, the, position, of, persian, women, in, actual, persia, has, traditionally, been, described, from, mythological, biblical, references, and, the, sometimes, biased, ancient, greek, sources, neither, of, them, fully, reliable, as, sources, but, the, most, reliable, references, are, the, archeological, persepolis, fortification, tablets, pft, which, describes, women, in, connection, to, the, royal, court, in, persepolis, from, royal, women, to, female, laborers, who, were, recipients, of, food, rations, at, persepolis, the, hierarchy, of, the, royal, women, at, the, persian, court, was, ranked, with, the, king, s, mother, first, followed, by, the, queen, and, the, king, s, daughters, the, king, s, concubines, and, the, other, women, of, the, royal, palace, the, king, normally, married, a, female, member, of, the, royal, family, or, a, persian, noblewoman, related, to, a, satrap, or, another, important, persian, man, it, was, permitted, for, members, of, the, royal, family, to, marry, relatives, but, there, is, no, evidence, for, marriage, between, closer, family, members, than, half, siblings, the, king, s, concubines, were, often, either, slaves, sometimes, prisoners, of, war, or, foreign, princesses, whom, the, king, did, not, marry, because, they, were, foreigners, and, whose, children, did, not, have, the, right, to, inherit, the, throne, greek, sources, accuse, the, king, of, having, hundreds, of, concubines, secluded, in, a, harem, but, there, is,

poetry, to, which, poets, of, iranian, origin, composing, their, poems, in, arabic, made, a, very, significant, contribution, in, a, sense, iranian, islam, is, a, second, advent, of, islam, itself, a, new, islam, sometimes, referred, to, as, islam, i, ajam, it, was, this, persian, islam, rather, than, the, original, arab, islam, that, was, brought, to, new, areas, and, new, peoples, to, the, turks, first, in, central, asia, and, then, in, the, middle, east, in, the, country, which, came, to, be, called, turkey, and, of, course, to, india, the, ottoman, turks, brought, a, form, of, iranian,

become, a, dominant, element, in, islam, itself, and, for, several, centuries, the, main, centers, of, the, islamic, power, and, civilization, were, in, countries, that, were, if, not, iranian, at, least, marked, by, iranian, civilization, the, major, centers, of, islam, in, the, late, medieval, and, early, modern, periods, the, centers, of, both, political, and, cultural, power, such, as,

empire, that, passed, away, and, its, people, as, the, first, historical, people, in, history, according, to, his, account, the, persian, empire, is, an, empire, in, the, modern, sense, like, that, which, existed, in, germany, and, the, great, imperial, realm, under, the, sway, of, napoleon, for, we, find, it, consisting, of, a, number, of, states, which, are, indeed, dependent, but, which, have, retained, their, own, individuality, their, manners, and, laws, the, general, enactments, binding, upon, all, did, not, infringe, upon, their, political, and, social, idiosyncrasies, but, even, protected, and, maintained, them, so, that, each, of, the, nations, that, constitute, the, whole, had, its, own, form, of, constitution, as, light, illuminates, everything, imparting, to, each, object, a, peculiar, vitality, so, the, persian, empire, extends, over, a, multitude, of, nations, and, leaves, to, each, one, its, particular, character, some, have, even, kings, of, their, own, each, one, its, distinct, language, arms, way, of, life, and, customs, all, this, diversity, coexists, harmoniously, under, the, impartial, dominion, of, light, a, combination, of, peoples, leaving,
