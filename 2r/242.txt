the, qara, qoyunlu, or, kara, koyunlu, azerbaijani, qaraqoyunlular, persian, also, known, as, the, black, sheep, turkomans, were, a, culturally, persianate, muslim, turkoman, monarchy, that, ruled, over, the, territory, comprising, present, day, azerbaijan, armenia, northwestern, iran, eastern, turkey, and, northeastern, iraq, from, about, 1374, to, 1468, the, name, qara, qoyunlu, literally, means, black, sheep, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, name, refers, to, old, totemic, symbols, but, according, to, rashid, al, din, hamadani, the, turks, were, forbidden, to, eat, the, flesh, of, their, totem, animals, and, so, this, is, unlikely, given, the, importance, of, mutton, in, the, diet, of, pastoral, nomads, another, hypothesis, is, that, the, name, refers, to, the, predominant, color, of, their, flocks, the, ruling, family, descended, from, the, y, wa, tribe, of, the, oghuz, turks, specifically, the, baharlu, who, by, the, fourteenth, century, possessed, territories, north, of, lake, van, and, mosul, in, upper, mesopotamia, the, tribes, that, comprised, the, qara, qoyunlu, besides, baharlu, were, the, saadlu, in, nakhchevan, the, karamanlu, in, ganja, and, barda, a,

qara, qoyunlu, first, appeared, in, the, chronicle, of, michael, panaretos, it, is, probable, that, the, duharlu, tribe, came, to, anatolia, from, central, asia, during, the, mongol, invasions, as, testified, by, the, legendary, tradition, of, qara, qoyunlu, the, qara, qoyunlu, turkomans, were, initially, vassals, of, the, jalayirid, sultanate, in, baghdad, and, tabriz, from, about, 1375, when,

according, to, faruk, s, mer, they, were, released, on, the, orders, of, rebellious, wali, of, damascus, sheykh, mahmud, qara, yusuf, having, returned, from, exile, forced, timur, s, governor, of, van, izzaddin, shir, to, submit, while, capturing, altam, another, viceroy, set, up, by, timur, and, sending, him, to, barquq, he, later, moved, on, to, the, territories, of, azerbaijan, he, defeated,

yusif, after, the, death, of, qara, yusuf, in, december, 1420, shah, rukh, tried, to, take, azerbaijan, from, qara, yusuf, s, son, iskander, using, the, fact, that, none, of, his, sons, was, accompanying, his, father, despite, defeating, iskander, twice, in, 1420, 21, and, 1429, only, in, the, third, expedition, of, shahrukh, mirza, in, 1434, 35, did, the, timurids, succeed, when, he, entrusted, the, government, to, iskander, s, own, brother, jahan, shah, 1436, 1467, as, his, vassal, in, 1436, he, obtained, the, help, of, shah, rukh, to, defeat, iskander, and, seize, the, throne, for, himself, he, was, also, adopted, by, gawhar, shad, and, crowned, on, 19, april, 1438, taking, the, epithet, muzaffar, al, din, due, to, the, mistakes, of, his, predecessor, the, timurid, shah,

in, the, battle, of, mus, qara, qoyunlu, was, almost, destroyed, this, time, hasanali, mirza, came, to, power, but, was, killed, by, uzun, hasan, and, the, qara, qoyunlu, state, collapsed, in, 1410, armenia, fell, under, the, control, of, the, qara, qoyunlu, the, principal, armenian, sources, available, in, this, period, come, from, the, historian, tovma, metsopetsi, and, several, colophons, to, contemporary, manuscripts, according, to, tovma, although, the, qara, qoyunlu, levied, heavy, taxes, against, the, armenians, the, early, years, of, their, rule, were, relatively, peaceful, and, some, reconstruction, of, towns, took, place, this, peaceful, period, was, however, shattered, with, the, rise, of, qara, iskander, who, reportedly, made, armenia, a, desert, and, subjected, it, to, devastation, and, plunder, to, slaughter, and, captivity, iskander, s, wars, with, and, eventual, defeat, by, the, timurids, invited, further, destruction, in, armenia, as, many, armenians, were, taken, captive, and, sold, into, slavery, and, the, land, was, subjected, to, outright, pillaging, forcing, many, of, them, to, leave, the, region, iskander, did, attempt, to, reconcile, with, the, armenians, by, appointing, an, armenian, from, a, noble, family, rustum, as, one, of, his, advisers, when, the, timurids, launched, their, final, incursion, into, the, region, they, convinced, jihanshah, iskander, s, brother, to, turn, on, his, brother, jihanshah, pursued, a, policy, of, persecution, against, the, armenians, in, syunik, and, colophons, to, armenian, manuscripts, record, the, sacking, of, the, tatev, monastery, by, his, forces, but, he, too, sought, a, rapprochement, with, the, armenians, allotting, land, to, feudal, lords, rebuilding, churches, and, approving, the, relocation, of, the, seat, of, the, armenian, apostolic, church, s, catholicos, to, etchmiadzin, cathedral, in, 1441, for, all, this, jihanshah, continued, to, attack, armenian, towns, and, take, armenian, captives, as, the, country, saw, further, devastation, in, the, final, years, of, jihanshah, s, failed, struggles, with, the, aq, qoyunlu, jahan, shah, made, peace, with, the, timurid, shahrukh, mirza, however, this, soon, fell, apart, when, shahrukh, mirza, died, in, 1447, the, qara, qoyunlu, turkomans, annexed, portions, of, iraq, and, the, eastern, coast, of, the, arabian, peninsula, as, well, as, timurid, controlled, western, iran, though, much, territory, was, gained, during, his, rule, jah, n, sh, h, s, reign, was, troubled, by, his, rebellious, sons, and, the, almost, autonomous, rulers, of, baghdad, whom, he, expelled, in, 1464, in, 1466, jahan, shah, attempted, to, take, diyarbak, r, from, the, aq, qoyunlu, white, sheep, turkomans, however, this, was, a, catastrophic, failure, resulting, in, jah, n, sh, h, s, death, and, the, collapse, of, the, qara, qoyunlu, turkomans, control, in, the, middle, east, by, 1468, at, their, height, under, uzun, hasan, 1452, 1478, aq, qoyunlu, defeated, the, qara, qoyunlu, and, conquered, iraq, azerbaijan, and, western, iran, the, argument, that, there, was, a, clear, cut, contrast, between, the, sunnism, of, the, q, qoyunl, and, the, shi, ism, of, the, qara, qoyunl, and, the, afaw, ya, rests, mainly, on, later, safavid, sources, and, must, be, considered, doubtful, as, to, the, religious, affiliations, of, the, qara, qoyunlu, although, some, of, the, later, members, of, the, family, had, shi, i, type, names, and, there, were, occasional, shi, i, coin, legends, there, seems, no, strong, evidence, for, definite, shi, i, sympathies, among, many, turkmen, elements, of, the, time, during, the, qara, period, shi, ism, became, widespread, successful, activities, of, shaykh, junayd, i, safavi, in, azerbaijan, and, anatolia, and, the, musha, sha, iyyah, in, khuzestan, are, the, most, important, pieces, of, evidence, that, shi, ism, was, spread, by, the, sword, it, can, be, said, like, yar, ali, brother, of, qara, yusuf, in, the, qara, qoyunlu, dynasty, there, is, a, conscious, love, for, ali, caliph, however, the, names, of, four, caliphs, are, seen, on, the, coins, of, qara, yusuf, isqandar, and, jahan, shah, in, addition, to, that, there, is, no, record, in, the, contemporary, aq, qoyunlu, mamluk, and, timurid, sources, that, the, qara, qoyunlu, rulers, were, inclined, to, shi, ism, the, qara, qoyunlu, state, organization, was, based, mainly, on, of, its, predecessors, jalayirids, and, the, ilkhanids, qara, qoyunlu, rulers, used, the, title, sultan, since, the, enthronement, of, pirbudag, by, qara, yusuf, sometimes, the, title, bahadur, appeared, on, the, coinage, they, also, used, the, titles, khan, khagan, and, padishah, keeping, with, a, persianate, culture, the, qara, qoyunlu, used, the, persian, language, for, diplomacy, poetry, and, as, a, court, language, diplomatic, letters, to, the, timurids, and, ottomans, were, written, in, persian, while, the, correspondence, with, the, mamluk, sultans, were, in, arabic, official, internal, documents, farm, n, suy, rgh, l, were, also, written, in, persian, as, for, the, provincial, organization, the, provinces, were, governed, by, ehzade, and, beys, who, had, smaller, divans, in, each, of, the, provinces, the, governance, by, military, governors, beys, generally, passed, on, from, father, to, son, in, the, cities, there, were, officials, called, darugha, that, looked, after, financial, and, administrative, affairs, and, also, had, political, powers, the, ehzades, and, beys, had, their, own, soldiers, which, were, called, n, kers, who, were, trained, and, salaried, under, timur, the, cultural, entity, of, iran, was, renewed, by, persian, literature, art, and, culture, being, patronized, throughout, the, timurid, empire, consequently, qara, qoyunlu, art, was, notably, influenced, by, the, timurids, jahan, shah, wrote, his, poetry, in, azerbaijani, and, persian, while, the, kitab, i, diyarbakriyya, a, history, of, the, qara, qoyunlu, and, aq, qoyunlu, was, written, by, abu, bakr, tehrani, in, persian
