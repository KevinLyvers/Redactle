chronological, history, the, history, of, scandinavia, is, the, history, of, the, geographical, region, of, scandinavia, and, its, peoples, the, region, is, located, in, northern, europe, and, consists, of, denmark, norway, and, sweden, finland, and, iceland, are, at, times, especially, in, english, speaking, contexts, considered, part, of, scandinavia, little, evidence, remains, in, scandinavia, of, the, stone, age, the, bronze, age, or, the, iron, age, except, limited, numbers, of, tools, created, from, stone, bronze, and, iron, some, jewelry, and, ornaments, and, stone, burial, cairns, one, important, collection, that, exists, however, is, a, widespread, and, rich, collection, of, stone, drawings, known, as, petroglyphs, during, the, weichselian, glaciation, almost, all, of, scandinavia, was, buried, beneath, a, thick, permanent, sheet, of, ice, and, the, stone, age, was, delayed, in, this, region, some, valleys, close, to, the, watershed, were, indeed, ice, free, around, 30, 000, years, b, p, coastal, areas, were, ice, free, several, times, between, 75, 000, and, 30, 000, years, b, p, and, the, final, expansion, towards, the, late, weichselian, maximum, took, place, after, 28, 000, years, b, p, as, the, climate, slowly, warmed, up, at, the, end, of, the, ice, age, and, deglaciation, took, place, nomadic, hunters, from, central, europe, sporadically, visited, the, region, but, it, was, not, until, around, 12, 000, bce, before, permanent, but, nomadic, habitation, took, root, as, the, ice, receded, reindeer, grazed, on, the, flat, lands, of, denmark, and, southernmost, sweden, this, was, the, land, of, the, ahrensburg, culture, tribes, who, hunted, over, vast, territories, and, lived, in, lavvus, on, the, tundra, there, was, little, forest, in, this, region, except, for, arctic, white, birch, and, rowan, but, the, taiga, slowly, appeared, from, c, 9, 000, to, 6, 000, b, p, middle, to, late, mesolithic, scandinavia, was, populated, by, mobile, or, semi, sedentary, groups, about, whom, little, is, known, they, subsisted, by, hunting, fishing, and, gathering, approximately, 200, burial, sites, have, been, investigated, in, the, region, from, this, period, of, 3, 000, years, in, the, 7th, millennium, bc, when, the, reindeer, and, their, hunters, had, moved, for, northern, scandinavia, forests, had, been, established, in, the, land, the, maglemosian, culture, lived, in, denmark, and, southern, sweden, to, the, north, in, norway, and, most, of, southern, sweden, lived, the, fosna, hensbacka, culture, who, lived, mostly, along, the, edge, of, the, forest, the, northern, hunter, gatherers, followed, the, herds, and, the, salmon, runs, moving, south, during, the, winters, moving, north, again, during, the, summers, these, early, peoples, followed, cultural, traditions, similar, to, those, practised, throughout, other, regions, in, the, far, north, areas, including, modern, finland, russia, and, across, the, bering, strait, into, the, northernmost, strip, of, north, america, during, the, 6th, millennium, bc, southern, scandinavia, was, covered, in, temperate, broadleaf, and, mixed, forests, fauna, included, aurochs, wisent, moose, and, red, deer, the, kongemose, culture, was, dominant, in, this, time, period, they, hunted, seals, and, fished, in, the, rich, waters, north, of, the, kongemose, people, lived, other, hunter, gatherers, in, most, of, southern, norway, and, sweden, called, the, n, stvet, and, lihult, cultures, descendants, of, the, fosna, and, hensbacka, cultures, near, the, end, of, the, 6th, millennium, bc, the, kongemose, culture, was, replaced, by, the, erteb, lle, culture, in, the, south, during, the, 5th, millennium, bc, the, erteb, lle, people, learned, pottery, from, neighbouring, tribes, in, the, south, who, had, begun, to, cultivate, the, land, and, keep, animals, they, too, started, to, cultivate, the, land, and, by, 3000, bc, they, became, part, of, the, megalithic, funnelbeaker, culture, during, the, 4th, millennium, bc, these, funnelbeaker, tribes, expanded, into, sweden, up, to, uppland, the, n, stvet, and, lihult, tribes, learnt, new, technology, from, the, advancing, farmers, but, not, agriculture, and, became, the, pitted, ware, cultures, towards, the, end, of, the, 4th, millennium, bc, these, pitted, ware, tribes, halted, the, advance, of, the, farmers, and, pushed, them, south, into, southwestern, sweden, but, some, say, that, the, farmers, were, not, killed, or, chased, away, but, that, they, voluntarily, joined, the, pitted, ware, culture, and, became, part, of, them, at, least, one, settlement, appears, to, be, mixed, the, alvastra, pile, dwelling, it, is, not, known, what, language, these, early, scandinavians, spoke, but, towards, the, end, of, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, they, were, overrun, by, new, tribes, who, many, scholars, think, spoke, proto, indo, european, the, battle, axe, culture, this, new, people, advanced, up, to, uppland, and, the, oslofjord, and, they, probably, provided, the, language, that, was, the, ancestor, of, the, modern, scandinavian, languages, they, were, cattle, herders, and, with, them, most, of, southern, scandinavia, entered, the, neolithic, the, transmission, of, metallurgy, to, southern, scandinavia, coincided, with, the, introduction, of, long, barrows, causewayed, enclosures, two, aisled, houses, and, certain, types, of, artefacts, and, seems, to, have, enabled, the, establishment, of, a, fully, neolithic, society, even, though, scandinavians, joined, the, european, bronze, age, cultures, fairly, late, through, trade, scandinavian, sites, present, rich, and, well, preserved, objects, made, of, wool, wood, and, imported, central, european, bronze, and, gold, during, this, period, scandinavia, gave, rise, to, the, first, known, advanced, civilization, in, this, area, following, the, nordic, stone, age, the, scandinavians, adopted, many, central, european, and, mediterranean, symbols, at, the, same, time, that, they, created, new, styles, and, objects, mycenaean, greece, the, villanovan, culture, phoenicia, and, ancient, egypt, have, all, been, identified, as, possible, sources, of, influence, in, scandinavian, artwork, from, this, period, the, foreign, influence, is, believed, to, originate, with, amber, trade, and, amber, found, in, mycenaean, graves, from, this, period, originates, from, the, baltic, sea, several, petroglyphs, depict, ships, and, the, large, stone, formations, known, as, stone, ships, indicate, that, shipping, played, an, important, role, in, the, culture, several, petroglyphs, depict, ships, which, could, possibly, be, mediterranean, from, this, period, there, are, many, mounds, and, fields, of, petroglyphs, but, their, signification, is, long, since, lost, there, are, also, numerous, artifacts, of, bronze, and, gold, the, rather, crude, appearance, of, the, petroglyphs, compared, to, the, bronze, works, have, given, rise, to, the, theory, that, they, were, produced, by, different, cultures, or, different, social, groups, no, written, language, existed, in, the, nordic, countries, during, the, bronze, age, the, nordic, bronze, age, was, characterized, by, a, warm, climate, comparable, to, that, of, the, mediterranean, which, permitted, a, relatively, dense, population, but, it, ended, with, a, climate, change, consisting, of, deteriorating, wetter, and, colder, climate, which, is, sometimes, believed, to, have, given, rise, to, the, legend, of, the, fimbulwinter, it, seems, very, likely, that, the, climate, pushed, the, germanic, tribes, southwards, into, continental, europe, during, this, time, there, was, scandinavian, influence, in, eastern, europe, a, thousand, years, later, the, numerous, east, germanic, tribes, that, claimed, scandinavian, origins, burgundians, goths, and, heruls, as, did, the, lombards, rendered, scandinavia, scandza, the, name, womb, of, nations, in, jordanes, getica, the, nordic, bronze, age, ended, with, a, deteriorating, colder, and, wetter, climate, this, period, is, known, for, being, poor, in, archaeological, finds, this, is, also, the, period, when, the, germanic, tribes, became, known, to, the, mediterranean, world, and, the, romans, in, 113, 101, bc, two, germanic, tribes, originating, from, jutland, in, modern, day, denmark, attacked, the, roman, republic, in, what, is, today, known, as, the, cimbrian, war, these, two, tribes, the, cimbri, and, the, teutons, initially, inflicted, the, heaviest, losses, that, rome, had, suffered, since, the, second, punic, war, the, cimbri, and, the, teutons, were, eventually, defeated, by, the, roman, legions, initially, iron, was, valuable, and, was, used, for, decoration, the, oldest, objects, were, needles, but, swords, and, sickles, are, found, as, well, bronze, continued, to, be, used, during, the, whole, period, but, was, mostly, used, for, decoration, the, traditions, were, a, continuity, from, the, nordic, bronze, age, but, there, were, strong, influences, from, the, hallstatt, culture, in, central, europe, they, continued, with, the, urnfield, culture, tradition, of, burning, corpses, and, placing, the, remains, in, urns, during, the, last, centuries, influences, from, the, central, european, la, t, ne, culture, spread, to, scandinavia, from, northwestern, germany, and, there, are, finds, from, this, period, from, all, the, provinces, of, southern, scandinavia, from, this, time, archaeologists, have, found, swords, shieldbosses, spearheads, scissors, sickles, pincers, knives, needles, buckles, kettles, etc, bronze, continued, to, be, used, for, torques, and, kettles, the, style, of, which, were, a, continuity, from, the, bronze, age, one, of, the, most, prominent, finds, is, the, dejbjerg, wagon, from, jutland, a, four, wheeled, wagon, of, wood, with, bronze, parts, while, many, germanic, tribes, sustained, continued, contact, with, the, culture, and, military, presence, of, the, roman, empire, much, of, scandinavia, existed, on, the, most, extreme, periphery, of, the, latin, world, with, the, exception, of, the, passing, references, to, the, swedes, suiones, and, the, geats, gautoi, much, of, scandinavia, remained, unrecorded, by, roman, authors, in, scandinavia, there, was, a, great, import, of, goods, such, as, coins, more, than, 7, 000, vessels, bronze, images, glass, beakers, enameled, buckles, weapons, etc, moreover, the, style, of, metal, objects, and, clay, vessels, was, markedly, roman, some, objects, appeared, for, the, first, time, such, as, shears, and, pawns, there, are, also, many, bog, bodies, from, this, time, in, denmark, schleswig, and, southern, sweden, together, with, the, bodies, there, are, weapons, household, wares, and, clothes, of, wool, great, ships, made, for, rowing, have, been, found, from, the, 4th, century, in, nydam, mosse, in, schleswig, many, were, buried, without, burning, but, the, burning, tradition, later, regained, its, popularity, through, the, 5th, century, and, 6th, century, gold, and, silver, became, more, common, much, of, this, can, be, attributed, to, the, ransacking, of, the, roman, empire, by, germanic, tribes, from, which, many, scandinavians, returned, with, gold, and, silver, the, period, succeeding, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, is, known, as, the, germanic, iron, age, and, it, is, divided, into, the, early, germanic, iron, and, the, late, germanic, iron, age, which, in, sweden, is, known, as, the, vendel, age, with, rich, burials, in, the, basin, of, lake, m, laren, the, early, germanic, iron, age, is, the, period, when, the, danes, appear, in, history, and, according, to, jordanes, they, were, of, the, same, stock, as, the, swedes, suehans, suetidi, and, had, replaced, the, heruls, during, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, there, was, an, abundance, of, gold, that, flowed, into, scandinavia, and, there, are, excellent, works, in, gold, from, this, period, gold, was, used, to, make, scabbard, mountings, and, bracteates, notable, examples, are, the, golden, horns, of, gallehus, after, the, roman, empire, had, disappeared, gold, became, scarce, and, scandinavians, began, to, make, objects, of, gilded, bronze, with, decorations, of, interlacing, animals, in, scandinavian, style, the, early, germanic, iron, age, decorations, show, animals, that, are, rather, faithful, anatomically, but, in, the, late, germanic, iron, age, they, evolve, into, intricate, shapes, with, interlacing, and, interwoven, limbs, that, are, well, known, from, the, viking, age, in, february, 2020, secrets, of, the, ice, program, researchers, discovered, a, 1, 500, year, old, viking, arrowhead, dating, back, to, the, germanic, iron, age, and, locked, in, a, glacier, in, southern, norway, caused, by, the, climate, change, in, the, jotunheimen, mountains, the, arrowhead, made, of, iron, was, revealed, with, its, cracked, wooden, shaft, and, a, feather, is, 17, cm, long, and, weighs, just, 28, grams, the, origins, of, the, s, mi, developed, during, prehistoric, times, as, the, sami, people, of, arctic, europe, have, lived, and, worked, in, an, area, that, stretches, over, the, northern, parts, of, the, regions, now, known, as, norway, sweden, finland, and, the, russian, kola, peninsula, the, sami, are, counted, among, the, arctic, peoples, and, are, members, of, circumpolar, groups, such, as, the, arctic, council, indigenous, peoples, secretariat, the, s, mi, have, a, complex, relationship, with, the, scandinavians, known, as, norse, people, in, the, medieval, era, the, dominant, peoples, of, scandinavia, who, speak, scandinavian, languages, and, who, founded, and, thus, dominated, the, kingdoms, of, norway, and, sweden, in, which, most, s, mi, people, live, while, the, s, mi, have, lived, in, fennoscandia, for, around, 3, 500, years, s, mi, settlement, of, scandinavia, does, not, predate, norse, scandinavian, settlement, of, scandinavia, as, sometimes, popularly, assumed, due, to, the, different, definitions, of, the, term, indigenous, which, can, refer, to, original, inhabitants, or, in, this, case, culture, that, differs, from, the, dominant, one, the, migration, of, germanic, speaking, peoples, to, southern, scandinavia, happened, independently, and, separate, from, the, later, s, mi, migrations, into, the, northern, regions, petroglyphs, and, archeological, findings, such, as, settlements, dating, from, about, 10, 000, b, c, can, be, found, in, the, traditional, lands, of, the, sami, these, hunters, and, gatherers, of, the, late, paleolithic, and, early, mesolithic, were, named, komsa, who, predated, the, sami, and, are, thought, to, have, mixed, with, other, populations, that, would, later, become, part, of, sami, culture, the, sami, have, been, recognized, as, an, indigenous, people, in, norway, since, 1990, according, to, ilo, convention, 169, and, hence, according, to, international, law, the, sami, people, in, norway, are, entitled, special, protection, and, rights, during, the, viking, age, the, vikings, scandinavian, warriors, and, traders, raided, colonized, and, explored, large, parts, of, europe, the, middle, east, northern, africa, as, far, west, as, newfoundland, the, beginning, of, the, viking, age, is, commonly, given, as, 793, when, vikings, pillaged, the, important, british, island, monastery, of, lindisfarne, and, its, end, is, marked, by, the, unsuccessful, invasion, of, england, attempted, by, harald, h, rdr, de, in, 1066, and, the, norman, conquest, the, age, of, settlement, began, around, 800, ad, the, vikings, invaded, and, eventually, settled, in, scotland, england, greenland, the, faroe, islands, iceland, ireland, livonia, normandy, the, shetland, islands, sicily, rus, and, vinland, on, what, is, now, known, as, the, island, of, newfoundland, swedish, settlers, were, mostly, present, in, rus, livonia, and, other, eastern, regions, while, the, norwegians, and, the, danish, were, primarily, concentrated, in, western, and, northern, europe, these, eastern, traveling, scandinavian, migrants, were, eventually, known, as, varangians, v, ringjar, meaning, sworn, men, and, according, to, the, oldest, slavic, sources, these, varangians, founded, kievan, rus, the, major, east, european, state, prior, to, the, mongol, invasions, the, western, led, warriors, eventually, known, as, vikings, left, great, cultural, marks, on, regions, such, as, french, normandy, england, and, ireland, where, the, city, of, dublin, was, founded, by, viking, invaders, iceland, first, became, colonized, in, the, late, 9th, century, before, and, during, this, age, the, norsemen, significantly, intermixed, with, the, slavs, the, slavic, and, viking, cultures, influenced, each, other, slavic, and, viking, tribes, were, closely, linked, fighting, one, another, intermixing, and, trading, in, the, middle, ages, a, significant, amount, of, ware, was, transferred, from, slavic, areas, to, scandinavia, and, denmark, was, a, melting, pot, of, slavic, and, scandinavian, elements, the, presence, of, slavs, in, scandinavia, is, more, significant, than, previously, thought, although, the, slavs, and, their, interaction, with, scandinavia, have, not, been, adequately, investigated, a, grave, of, a, warrior, woman, dating, to, the, 10th, century, in, denmark, was, long, thought, to, belong, to, a, viking, however, new, analyses, revealed, that, the, woman, was, a, slav, from, present, day, poland, the, first, king, of, the, swedes, eric, was, married, to, gunhild, of, the, polish, house, of, piast, likewise, his, son, olof, fell, in, love, with, edla, a, slavic, woman, and, took, her, as, his, frilla, concubine, she, bore, him, a, son, and, a, daughter, emund, the, old, king, of, sweden, and, astrid, queen, of, norway, cnut, the, great, king, of, denmark, england, and, norway, was, the, son, of, a, daughter, of, mieszko, i, of, poland, possibly, the, former, polish, queen, of, sweden, wife, of, eric, viking, religious, beliefs, were, heavily, connected, to, norse, mythology, vikings, placed, heavy, emphasis, on, battle, honor, and, focused, on, the, idea, of, valhalla, a, mythical, home, with, the, gods, for, fallen, warriors, another, norse, tradition, was, that, of, blood, feuds, which, particularly, had, devastated, iceland, christianity, in, scandinavia, came, later, than, most, parts, of, europe, in, denmark, harald, bluetooth, christianized, the, country, around, 965, the, process, of, christianization, began, in, norway, during, the, reigns, of, olaf, tryggvason, r, 995, ad, c, 1000, ad, and, olaf, ii, haraldsson, reigned, 1015, ad, 1030, ad, olaf, and, olaf, ii, had, been, baptized, voluntarily, outside, of, norway, olaf, ii, managed, to, bring, english, clergy, to, his, country, norway, s, conversion, from, the, norse, religion, to, christianity, was, mostly, the, result, of, english, missionaries, as, a, result, of, the, adoption, of, christianity, by, the, monarchy, and, eventually, the, entirety, of, the, country, traditional, shamanistic, practices, were, marginalized, and, eventually, persecuted, v, lvas, practitioners, of, seid, a, scandinavian, pre, christian, tradition, were, executed, or, exiled, under, newly, christianized, governments, in, the, eleventh, and, twelfth, centuries, the, icelandic, commonwealth, adopted, christianity, in, 1000, ad, after, pressure, from, norway, the, go, i, chieftain, orgeirr, lj, svetningago, i, was, instrumental, in, bringing, this, about, by, formulating, a, law, that, made, christianity, the, official, religion, but, also, that, religious, practice, in, the, private, sphere, was, outside, of, the, law, he, managed, to, stave, off, the, threat, from, norway, limiting, the, feuds, and, avoiding, a, religiously, motivated, civil, war, sweden, required, a, little, more, time, to, transition, to, christianity, with, indigenous, religious, practices, commonly, held, in, localized, communities, well, until, the, end, of, the, eleventh, century, a, brief, swedish, civil, war, ensued, in, 1066, primarily, reflecting, the, divisions, between, practitioners, of, indigenous, religions, and, advocates, of, christianity, by, the, mid, twelfth, century, the, christian, faction, appeared, to, have, triumphed, the, once, resistant, center, of, uppsala, became, the, seat, of, the, swedish, archbishop, in, 1164, the, christianization, of, scandinavia, occurred, nearly, simultaneously, with, the, end, of, the, viking, era, the, adoption, of, christianity, is, believed, to, have, aided, in, the, absorption, of, viking, communities, into, the, greater, religious, and, cultural, framework, of, the, european, continent, the, kalmar, union, danish, norwegian, swedish, kalmarunionen, was, a, series, of, personal, unions, 1397, 1520, that, united, the, three, kingdoms, of, denmark, norway, and, sweden, under, a, single, monarch, the, countries, had, given, up, their, sovereignty, but, not, their, independence, and, diverging, interests, especially, swedish, dissatisfaction, over, the, danish, and, holsteinish, dominance, gave, rise, to, a, conflict, that, would, hamper, it, from, the, 1430s, until, its, final, dissolution, in, 1523, the, kalmar, war, in, 1611, 1613, was, the, last, serious, although, possibly, unrealistic, attempt, by, a, danish, king, christian, iv, to, re, create, the, kalmar, union, by, force, however, the, kalmar, war, ended, with, a, minor, danish, victory, and, not, the, total, defeat, of, the, swedes, no, more, danish, attempts, would, be, made, to, re, create, the, kalmar, union, following, this, war, the, protestant, reformation, came, to, scandinavia, in, the, 1530s, and, scandinavia, soon, became, one, of, the, heartlands, of, lutheranism, catholicism, almost, completely, vanished, in, scandinavia, except, for, a, small, population, in, denmark, the, thirty, years, war, was, a, conflict, fought, between, the, years, 1618, and, 1648, principally, in, the, central, european, territory, of, the, holy, roman, empire, but, also, involving, most, of, the, major, continental, powers, although, it, was, from, its, outset, a, religious, conflict, between, protestants, and, catholics, the, self, preservation, of, the, habsburg, dynasty, was, also, a, central, motive, the, danes, and, then, swedes, intervened, at, various, points, to, protect, their, interests, the, danish, intervention, began, when, christian, iv, 1577, 1648, the, king, of, denmark, norway, himself, a, lutheran, helped, the, german, protestants, by, leading, an, army, against, the, holy, roman, empire, fearing, that, denmark, s, sovereignty, as, a, protestant, nation, was, being, threatened, the, period, began, in, 1625, and, lasted, until, 1629, christian, iv, had, profited, greatly, from, his, policies, in, northern, germany, hamburg, had, been, forced, to, accept, danish, sovereignty, in, 1621, and, in, 1623, the, danish, heir, apparent, was, made, administrator, of, the, prince, bishopric, of, verden, in, 1635, he, became, administrator, of, the, prince, archbishopric, of, bremen, too, as, an, administrator, christian, iv, had, done, remarkably, well, obtaining, for, his, kingdom, a, level, of, stability, and, wealth, that, was, virtually, unmatched, elsewhere, in, europe, paid, for, by, the, resund, toll, and, extensive, war, reparations, from, sweden, it, also, helped, that, the, french, regent, cardinal, richelieu, was, willing, to, pay, for, a, danish, incursion, into, germany, christian, iv, invaded, at, the, head, of, a, mercenary, army, of, 20, 000, men, but, the, danish, forces, were, severely, beaten, and, christian, iv, had, to, sign, an, ignominious, defeat, the, first, in, a, series, of, military, setbacks, to, weaken, his, kingdom, the, swedish, intervention, began, in, 1630, and, lasted, until, 1635, some, within, ferdinand, ii, s, court, believed, that, wallenstein, wanted, to, take, control, of, the, german, princes, and, thus, gain, influence, over, the, emperor, ferdinand, ii, dismissed, wallenstein, in, 1630, he, later, recalled, him, after, gustavus, adolphus, attacked, the, empire, and, prevailed, in, a, number, of, significant, battles, gustavus, adolphus, like, christian, iv, before, him, came, to, aid, the, german, lutherans, to, forestall, catholic, aggression, against, their, homeland, and, to, obtain, economic, influence, in, the, german, states, around, the, baltic, sea, also, like, christian, iv, gustavus, adolphus, was, subsidized, by, richelieu, the, chief, minister, of, king, louis, xiii, of, france, and, by, the, dutch, from, 1630, to, 1634, they, drove, the, catholic, forces, back, and, regained, much, of, the, occupied, protestant, lands, the, swedish, rise, to, power, began, under, the, rule, of, charles, ix, during, the, ingrian, war, sweden, expanded, its, territories, eastward, several, other, wars, with, poland, denmark, norway, and, german, countries, enabled, further, swedish, expansion, although, there, were, some, setbacks, such, as, the, kalmar, war, sweden, began, consolidating, its, empire, several, other, wars, followed, soon, after, including, the, northern,

stockholm, treaties, as, a, result, of, the, war, russia, supplanted, sweden, as, the, dominant, power, on, the, baltic, sea, and, became, a, major, player, in, european, politics, both, sweden, and, denmark, norway, maintained, a, number, of, colonies, outside, scandinavia, starting, in, the, 17th, century, lasting, until, the, 20th, century, greenland, iceland, and, the, faroe, islands, in, the,

the, navy, britain, thereafter, attacked, the, danish, fleet, at, the, battle, of, copenhagen, 1801, and, bombarded, the, city, during, the, second, battle, of, copenhagen, 1807, most, of, the, danish, fleet, was, captured, following, the, second, battle, of, copenhagen, in, 1807, the, bombardment, of, copenhagen, led, to, an, alliance, with, france, and, outright, war, with, britain, whose, navy, blockaded, denmark, norway, and, severely, impeded, communication, between, the, two, kingdoms, and, caused, a, famine, in, norway, sweden, allied, with, britain, at, the, time, seized, the,

government, of, king, gustav, iv, adolf, led, to, his, deposition, and, banishment, a, new, constitution, was, introduced, and, his, uncle, charles, xiii, was, enthroned, since, he, was, childless, sweden, chose, as, his, successor, the, commander, in, chief, of, the, norwegian, army, prince, christian, august, of, augustenborg, however, his, sudden, death, in, 1810, forced, the, swedes, to, look, for, another, candidate, and, once, more, they, chose, an, enemy, officer, jean, baptiste, bernadotte, marshal, of, france, would, be, named, the, next, king, baron, karl, otto, m, rner, an, obscure, member, of, the, diet, was, the, one, who, initially, extended, the, offer, of, the, swedish, crown, to, the, young, soldier, bernadotte, was, originally, one, of, napoleon, s, eighteen, marshals, sweden, decided, to, join, the, alliance, against, france, in, 1813, and, was, promised, norway, as, a, reward, after, the, battle, of, leipzig, in, october, 1813, bernadotte, abandoned, the, pursuit, of, napoleon, and, marched, against, denmark, where, he, forced, the, king, of, denmark, norway, to, conclude, the, treaty, of, kiel, on, 14, january, 1814, norway, was, ceded, to, the, king, of, sweden, but, denmark, retained, the, norwegian, atlantic, possessions, of, the, faroe, islands, iceland, and, greenland, however, the, treaty, of, kiel, never, came, into, force, norway, declared, its, independence, adopted, a, liberal, constitution, and, elected, prince, christian, frederik, as, king, after, a, short, war, with, sweden, norway, had, to, concede, to, a, personal, union, with, sweden, at, the, convention, of, moss, king, christian, frederik, abdicated, and, left, for, denmark, in, october, and, the, norwegian, storting, parliament, elected, the, swedish, king, as, king, of, norway, after, having, enacted, such, amendments, to, the, constitution, as, were, necessary, to, allow, for, the, union, with, sweden, the, finnish, war, was, fought, between, sweden, and, russia, from, february, 1808, to, september, 1809, as, a, result, of, the, war, finland, which, formed, the, eastern, third, of, sweden, proper, became, the, autonomous, grand, duchy, of, finland, within, imperial, russia, finland, remained, as, a, part, of, russian, empire, until, 1917, at, which, point, it, became, independent, another, notable, effect, was, the, swedish, parliament, s, adoption, of, a, new, constitution, and, a, new, royal, house, that, of, bernadotte, on, 14, january, 1814, at, the, treaty, of, kiel, the, king, of, denmark, norway, ceded, norway, to, the, king, of, sweden, the, terms, of, the, treaty, provoked, widespread, opposition, in, norway, the, norwegian, vice, roy, and, heir, to, the, throne, of, denmark, norway, christian, frederik, took, the, lead, in, a, national, uprising, assumed, the, title, of, regent, and, convened, a, constitutional, assembly, at, eidsvoll, on, 17, may, 1814, the, constitution, of, norway, was, signed, by, the, assembly, and, christian, frederik, was, elected, as, king, of, independent, norway, the, swedish, king, rejected, the, premise, of, an, independent, norway, and, launched, a, military, campaign, on, 27, july, 1814, with, an, attack, on, the, hvaler, islands, and, the, city, of, fredrikstad, the, swedish, army, was, superior, in, numbers, was, better, equipped, and, trained, and, was, led, by, one, of, napoleon, s, foremost, generals, the, newly, elected, swedish, crown, prince, jean, baptiste, bernadotte, battles, were, short, and, decisively, won, by, the, swedes, armistice, negotiations, concluded, on, 14, august, 1814, in, the, peace, negotiations, christian, frederik, agreed, to, relinquish, claims, to, the, norwegian, crown, and, return, to, denmark, if, sweden, would, accept, the, democratic, norwegian, constitution, and, a, loose, personal, union, on, 4, november, 1814, the, norwegian, parliament, adopted, the, constitutional, amendments, required, to, enter, a, union, with, sweden, and, elected, king, charles, xiii, as, king, of, norway, following, growing, dissatisfaction, with, the, union, in, norway, the, parliament, unanimously, declared, its, dissolution, on, 7, june, 1905, this, unilateral, action, met, with, swedish, threats, of, war, a, plebiscite, on, 13, august, confirmed, the, parliamentary, decision, negotiations, in, karlstad, led, to, agreement, with, sweden, on, 23, september, and, mutual, demobilization, both, parliaments, revoked, the, act, of, union, 16, october, and, the, deposed, king, oscar, ii, of, sweden, renounced, his, claim, to, the, norwegian, throne, and, recognized, norway, as, an, independent, kingdom, on, 26, october, the, norwegian, parliament, offered, the, vacant, throne, to, prince, carl, of, denmark, who, accepted, after, another, plebiscite, had, confirmed, the, monarchy, he, arrived, in, norway, on, 25, november, 1905, taking, the, name, haakon, vii, industrialization, began, in, the, mid, 19th, century, in, scandinavia, in, denmark, industrialization, began, in, and, was, confined, to, copenhagen, until, the, 1890s, after, which, smaller, towns, began, to, grow, rapidly, denmark, remained, primarily, agricultural, until, well, into, the, 20th, century, but, agricultural, processes, were, modernized, and, processing, of, dairy, and, meats, became, more, important, than, the, export, of, raw, agricultural, products, industrialization, of, sweden, experienced, a, boom, during, the, first, world, war, the, construction, of, a, railway, connecting, southern, sweden, and, the, northern, mines, was, of, primary, importance, the, modern, use, of, the, term, scandinavia, rises, from, the, scandinavist, political, movement, which, was, active, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, chiefly, between, the, first, war, of, schleswig, 1848, 1850, in, which, sweden, and, norway, contributed, with, considerable, military, force, and, the, second, war, of, schleswig, 1864, when, the, riksdag, of, the, estates, denounced, the, king, s, promises, of, military, support, for, denmark, many, scandinavians, emigrated, to, canada, the, united, states, australia, africa, and, new, zealand, during, the, later, nineteenth, century, the, main, wave, of, scandinavian, emigration, occurred, in, the, 1860s, lasting, until, the, 1880s, although, substantial, emigration, continued, until, the, 1930s, the, vast, majority, of, emigrants, left, from, the, countryside, in, search, of, better, farming, and, economic, opportunities, together, with, finland, and, iceland, almost, a, third, of, the, population, left, in, the, eighty, years, after, 1850, part, of, the, reason, for, the, large, exodus, was, the, increasing, population, caused, by, falling, death, rates, which, increased, unemployment, norway, had, the, largest, percentage, of, emigrants, and, denmark, the, least, between, 1820, and, 1920, just, over, two, million, scandinavians, settled, in, the, united, states, one, million, came, from, sweden, 300, 000, from, denmark, and, 730, 000, from, norway, the, figure, for, norway, represents, almost, 80, of, the, national, population, in, 1800, the, most, popular, destinations, in, north, america, were, minnesota, iowa, the, dakotas, wisconsin, michigan, the, canadian, prairies, and, ontario, the, scandinavian, monetary, union, was, a, monetary, union, formed, by, sweden, and, denmark, on, 5, may, 1873, by, fixing, their, currencies, against, the, gold, standard, at, par, to, each, other, norway, which, was, in, union, with, sweden, entered, the, union, two, years, later, in, 1875, by, pegging, its, currency, to, gold, at, the, same, level, as, denmark, and, sweden, 403, grams, the, monetary, union, was, one, of, the, few, tangible, results, of, the, scandinavian, political, movement, of, the, 19th, century, the, union, provided, fixed, exchange, rates, and, stability, in, monetary, terms, but, the, member, countries, continued, to, issue, their, own, separate, currencies, even, if, it, was, not, initially, foreseen, the, perceived, security, led, to, a, situation, where, the, formally, separate, currencies, were, accepted, on, a, basis, of, as, good, as, the, legal, tender, virtually, throughout, the, entire, area, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, in, 1914, brought, an, end, to, the, monetary, union, sweden, abandoned, the, tie, to, gold, on, 2, august, 1914, and, without, a, fixed, exchange, rate, the, free, circulation, came, to, an, end, all, three, scandinavian, countries, remained, neutral, throughout, the, first, world, war, the, war, did, have, a, significant, impact, on, the, economy, of, the, area, primarily, as, a, result, of, the, british, blockade, of, germany, however, they, were, able, to, work, around, that, with, trade, agreement, with, britain, norway, s, large, merchant, marine, delivered, vital, supplies, to, britain, but, suffered, huge, losses, in, ships, and, sailors, because, of, indiscriminate, attack, by, the, german, navy, denmark, called, up, much, of, its, military, but, germany, still, violated, danish, sovereignty, to, some, extent, for, example, by, mining, the, resund, a, relatively, large, number, of, ethnic, danes, from, southern, jutland, fought, in, the, german, army, all, three, countries, developed, social, welfare, states, in, the, early, to, mid, 20th, century, this, came, about, partially, because, of, the, domination, of, the, social, democrats, in, sweden, and, denmark, and, the, labour, party, in, norway, near, the, beginning, of, world, war, ii, in, late, 1939, both, the, allies, and, the, axis, powers, feared, their, enemies, gaining, power, in, scandinavia, britain, believed, germany, was, planning, to, invade, and, made, counter, plans, for, its, own, invasion, at, the, same, time, germany, feared, that, britain, could, gain, bases, in, the, area, and, claimed, they, suspected, an, outright, invasion, in, addition, germany, highly, valued, the, swedish, iron, ore, they, received, through, norway, and, could, not, afford, to, lose, it, they, also, desired, norway, for, its, ice, free, ports, this, made, it, a, primary, target, with, denmark, a, secondary, goal, mainly, needed, for, facilitating, the, norwegian, invasion, after, planning, for, months, germany, invaded, both, denmark, and, norway, the, same, day, 9, april, 1940, days, before, britain, planned, to, invade, the, nations, reacted, quite, differently, denmark, surrendered, two, hours, after, invasion, having, lost, just, sixteen, men, they, sought, to, avoid, civilian, casualties, and, receive, favourable, treatment, from, germany, norway, however, refused, to, give, in, and, fought, valiantly, and, with, the, full, strength, of, her, limited, and, badly, prepared, forces, the, western, allies, sent, military, assistance, but, the, campaign, was, not, effectively, run, by, 10, june, 1940, norway, s, official, military, had, surrendered, to, the, attackers, while, king, haakon, vii, and, his, legal, government, fled, to, exile, in, britain, denmark, s, strategy, proved, the, more, beneficial, in, the, short, run, it, was, one, of, the, factors, that, led, germany, to, grant, the, danes, a, high, degree, of, autonomy, another, reason, was, that, they, had, no, real, agenda, in, denmark, after, invading, they, simply, did, not, want, to, relinquish, it, seeing, it, as, a, permanent, part, of, their, empire, also, danes, were, considered, fellow, nordics, and, aryans, by, nazi, ideologues, which, further, helped, the, country, for, all, these, reasons, denmark, was, able, to, retain, their, parliament, king, and, much, of, their, normal, domestic, function, however, bitterness, towards, germany, grew, and, small, sabotages, directed, against, germany, became, commonplace, germany, eventually, reacted, by, eliminating, denmark, s, representative, government, and, imposing, martial, law, norway, was, treated, much, more, harshly, throughout, their, occupation, opposition, parties, were, eliminated, and, nasjonal, samling, national, unity, the, norwegian, fascist, political, party, appointed, all, government, officials, vidkun, quisling, was, installed, as, minister, president, a, puppet, to, berlin, s, high, command, labor, unions, could, only, exist, if, they, accepted, nazi, control, these, repressive, measures, ensured, that, the, cooperation, was, small, about, ten, percent, supported, the, nazi, party, nevertheless, there, was, a, hostile, relationship, with, an, occupation, force, of, almost, one, german, for, every, ten, norwegians, denmark, and, norway, were, also, unlike, in, their, cooperation, with, germany, s, genocidal, policy, norwegian, police, controlled, by, the, quisling, government, aided, in, the, capture, of, norwegian, jews, in, 1942, however, brave, norwegians, managed, to, save, over, half, of, the, jewish, population, from, nazi, death, camps, and, help, them, to, escape, to, safety, in, sweden, even, though, they, ran, the, risk, of, being, severely, punished, for, aiding, jews, the, danish, jews, avoided, german, persecution, until, 1943, and, denmark, was, thus, better, prepared, when, the, germans, struck, danes, were, notable, for, their, devoted, efforts, to, protect, danish, jews, more, than, 96, of, the, jewish, population, was, boated, to, safety, in, sweden, while, others, found, refuge, with, christian, danish, families, and, organizations, alone, out, of, the, three, scandinavian, countries, sweden, was, not, invaded, and, remained, nominally, neutral, during, the, war, they, successfully, cultivated, peace, with, the, germans, supplying, them, with, needed, raw, materials, the, swedish, government, was, very, careful, to, avoid, inflaming, the, nazis, going, so, far, as, to, persuade, newspaper, editors, to, censor, articles, and, letting, the, nazis, move, supplies, through, sweden, and, into, norway, all, the, way, up, to, 1943, however, they, would, occasionally, aid, the, allies, they, granted, the, jews, that, escaped, from, denmark, asylum, and, gave, notable, aid, to, finland, during, the, winter, war, after, the, war, all, of, the, scandinavian, countries, agreed, that, some, form, of, mutual, defense, policy, was, necessary, they, began, to, discuss, a, scandinavian, defence, union, the, three, scandinavian, countries, would, if, they, had, entered, into, an, alliance, have, remained, separate, sovereign, countries, but, acted, as, a, single, bloc, in, foreign, policy, and, security, issues, the, proposed, union, was, being, discussed, by, a, joint, scandinavian, committee, during, the, winter, of, 1948, 1949, but, the, cold, war, tension, between, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, and, preparations, for, a, western, alliance, that, would, result, in, the, north, atlantic, treaty, overshadowed, the, effort, when, it, became, known, that, the, western, alliance, would, not, be, able, to, supply, the, scandinavian, countries, with, armaments, before, meeting, their, own, pressing, needs, this, issue, ultimately, proved, to, be, the, turning, point, for, norway, which, resigned, from, the, talks, denmark, was, still, willing, to, enter, into, an, alliance, with, sweden, but, the, swedes, saw, few, advantages, in, this, and, the, proposal, fell, norway, and, denmark, subsequently, became, signatory, parties, of, the, north, atlantic, treaty, and, members, of, nato, sweden, remained, neutral, after, a, heated, debate, but, eventually, joined, on, 7, march, 2024, following, the, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, the, nordic, countries, established, the, nordic, council, in, 1952, and, the, nordic, passport, union, two, years, later, after, a, 1972, referendum, denmark, became, the, first, scandinavian, member, of, the, european, economic, community, which, later, paved, the, way, for, the, eu, in, 1973, sweden, joined, the, eu, in, 1995, after, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, sweden, felt, it, could, do, so, without, being, provocative, norway, remains, outside, the, european, union, to, this, day, after, referendums, on, membership, in, 1972, and, 1994, although, it, is, a, signatory, of, the, schengen, treaty, and, a, member, of, the, european, economic, area, none, of, the, scandinavian, countries, except, finland, have, joined, the, euro, membership, being, rejected, by, referendum, in, both, denmark, and, sweden, denmark, voted, no, to, the, maastricht, treaty, in, 1992, but, reversed, the, decision, after, negotiating, opt, outs
