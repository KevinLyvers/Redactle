archaeology, or, archeology, is, the, study, of, human, activity, through, the, recovery, and, analysis, of, material, culture, the, archaeological, record, consists, of, artifacts, architecture, biofacts, or, ecofacts, sites, and, cultural, landscapes, archaeology, can, be, considered, both, a, social, science, and, a, branch, of, the, humanities, it, is, usually, considered, an, independent, academic, discipline, but, may, also, be, classified, as, part, of, anthropology, in, north, america, the, four, field, approach, history, or, geography, archaeologists, study, human, prehistory, and, history, from, the, development, of, the, first, stone, tools, at, lomekwi, in, east, africa, 3, 3, million, years, ago, up, until, recent, decades, archaeology, is, distinct, from, palaeontology, which, is, the, study, of, fossil, remains, archaeology, is, particularly, important, for, learning, about, prehistoric, societies, for, which, by, definition, there, are, no, written, records, prehistory, includes, over, 99, of, the, human, past, from, the, paleolithic, until, the, advent, of, literacy, in, societies, around, the, world, archaeology, has, various, goals, which, range, from, understanding, culture, history, to, reconstructing, past, lifeways, to, documenting, and, explaining, changes, in, human, societies, through, time, derived, from, greek, the, term, archaeology, means, the, study, of, ancient, history, the, discipline, involves, surveying, excavation, and, eventually, analysis, of, data, collected, to, learn, more, about, the, past, in, broad, scope, archaeology, relies, on, cross, disciplinary, research, archaeology, developed, out, of, antiquarianism, in, europe, during, the, 19th, century, and, has, since, become, a, discipline, practiced, around, the, world, archaeology, has, been, used, by, nation, states, to, create, particular, visions, of, the, past, since, its, early, development, various, specific, sub, disciplines, of, archaeology, have, developed, including, maritime, archaeology, feminist, archaeology, and, archaeoastronomy, and, numerous, different, scientific, techniques, have, been, developed, to, aid, archaeological, investigation, nonetheless, today, archaeologists, face, many, problems, such, as, dealing, with, pseudoarchaeology, the, looting, of, artifacts, a, lack, of, public, interest, and, opposition, to, the, excavation, of, human, remains, in, ancient, mesopotamia, a, foundation, deposit, of, the, akkadian, empire, ruler, naram, sin, ruled, c, 2200, bc, was, discovered, and, analysed, by, king, nabonidus, c, 550, bc, who, is, thus, known, as, the, first, archaeologist, not, only, did, he, lead, the, first, excavations, which, were, to, find, the, foundation, deposits, of, the, temples, of, ama, the, sun, god, the, warrior, goddess, anunitu, both, located, in, sippar, and, the, sanctuary, that, naram, sin, built, to, the, moon, god, located, in, harran, but, he, also, had, them, restored, to, their, former, glory, he, was, also, the, first, to, date, an, archaeological, artifact, in, his, attempt, to, date, naram, sin, s, temple, during, his, search, for, it, even, though, his, estimate, was, inaccurate, by, about, 1, 500, years, it, was, still, a, very, good, one, considering, the, lack, of, accurate, dating, technology, at, the, time, the, science, of, archaeology, from, greek, archaiologia, from, arkhaios, ancient, and, logia, logy, grew, out, of, the, older, multi, disciplinary, study, known, as, antiquarianism, antiquarians, studied, history, with, particular, attention, to, ancient, artifacts, and, manuscripts, as, well, as, historical, sites, antiquarianism, focused, on, the, empirical, evidence, that, existed, for, the, understanding, of, the, past, encapsulated, in, the, motto, of, the, 18th, century, antiquary, sir, richard, colt, hoare, we, speak, from, facts, not, theory, tentative, steps, towards, the, systematization, of, archaeology, as, a, science, took, place, during, the, enlightenment, period, in, europe, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, in, imperial, china, during, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, figures, such, as, ouyang, xiu, and, zhao, mingcheng, established, the, tradition, of, chinese, epigraphy, by, investigating, preserving, and, analyzing, ancient, chinese, bronze, inscriptions, from, the, shang, and, zhou, periods, p74, p95, in, his, book, published, in, 1088, shen, kuo, criticized, contemporary, chinese, scholars, for, attributing, ancient, bronze, vessels, as, creations, of, famous, sages, rather, than, artisan, commoners, and, for, attempting, to, revive, them, for, ritual, use, without, discerning, their, original, functionality, and, purpose, of, manufacture, such, antiquarian, pursuits, waned, after, the, song, period, were, revived, in, the, 17th, century, during, the, qing, dynasty, but, were, always, considered, a, branch, of, chinese, historiography, rather, than, a, separate, discipline, of, archaeology, pp74, 76, p97, in, renaissance, europe, philosophical, interest, in, the, remains, of, greco, roman, civilization, and, the, rediscovery, of, classical, culture, began, in, the, late, middle, ages, with, humanism, cyriacus, of, ancona, was, a, restlessly, itinerant, italian, humanist, and, antiquarian, who, came, from, a, prominent, family, of, merchants, in, ancona, a, maritime, republic, on, the, adriatic, he, was, called, by, his, contemporaries, pater, antiquitatis, father, of, antiquity, and, today, father, of, classical, archaeology, cyriac, of, ancona, was, the, most, enterprising, and, prolific, recorder, of, greek, and, roman, antiquities, particularly, inscriptions, in, the, fifteenth, century, and, the, general, accuracy, of, his, records, entitles, him, to, be, called, the, founding, father, of, modern, classical, archeology, he, traveled, throughout, greece, and, all, around, the, eastern, mediterranean, to, record, his, findings, on, ancient, buildings, statues, and, inscriptions, including, archaeological, remains, still, unknown, to, his, time, the, parthenon, delphi, the, egyptian, pyramids, the, hieroglyphics, he, noted, down, his, archaeological, discoveries, in, his, diary, commentaria, in, six, volumes, flavio, biondo, an, italian, renaissance, humanist, historian, created, a, systematic, guide, to, the, ruins, and, topography, of, ancient, rome, in, the, early, 15th, century, for, which, he, has, been, called, an, early, founder, of, archaeology, antiquarians, of, the, 16th, century, including, john, leland, and, william, camden, conducted, surveys, of, the, english, countryside, drawing, describing, and, interpreting, the, monuments, that, they, encountered, the, oed, first, cites, archaeologist, from, 1824, this, soon, took, over, as, the, usual, term, for, one, major, branch, of, antiquarian, activity, archaeology, from, 1607, onward, initially, meant, what, we, would, call, ancient, history, generally, with, the, narrower, modern, sense, first, seen, in, 1837, however, it, was, jacob, spon, who, in, 1685, offered, one, of, the, earliest, definitions, of, archaeologia, to, describe, the, study, of, antiquities, in, which, he, was, engaged, in, the, preface, of, a, collection, of, transcriptions, of, roman, inscriptions, which, he, had, gleaned, over, the, years, of, his, travels, entitled, miscellanea, eruditae, antiquitatis, twelfth, century, indian, scholar, kalhana, s, writings, involved, recording, of, local, traditions, examining, manuscripts, inscriptions, coins, and, architectures, which, is, described, as, one, of, the, earliest, traces, of, archaeology, one, of, his, notable, work, is, called, rajatarangini, which, was, completed, in, c, 1150, and, is, described, as, one, of, the, first, history, books, of, india, one, of, the, first, sites, to, undergo, archaeological, excavation, was, stonehenge, and, other, megalithic, monuments, in, england, john, aubrey, 1626, 1697, was, a, pioneer, archaeologist, who, recorded, numerous, megalithic, and, other, field, monuments, in, southern, england, he, was, also, ahead, of, his, time, in, the, analysis, of, his, findings, he, attempted, to, chart, the, chronological, stylistic, evolution, of, handwriting, medieval, architecture, costume, and, shield, shapes, excavations, were, also, carried, out, by, the, spanish, military, engineer, roque, joaqu, n, de, alcubierre, in, the, ancient, towns, of, pompeii, and, herculaneum, both, of, which, had, been, covered, by, ash, during, the, eruption, of, mount, vesuvius, in, ad, 79, these, excavations, began, in, 1748, in, pompeii, while, in, herculaneum, they, began, in, 1738, the, discovery, of, entire, towns, complete, with, utensils, and, even, human, shapes, as, well, the, unearthing, of, frescos, had, a, big, impact, throughout, europe, however, prior, to, the, development, of, modern, techniques, excavations, tended, to, be, haphazard, the, importance, of, concepts, such, as, stratification, and, context, were, overlooked, in, the, mid, 18th, century, the, german, johann, joachim, winckelmann, lived, in, rome, and, devoted, himself, to, the, study, of, roman, antiquities, gradually, acquiring, an, unrivalled, knowledge, of, ancient, art, then, he, visited, the, archaeological, excavations, being, conducted, at, pompeii, and, herculaneum, he, was, one, of, the, founders, of, scientific, archaeology, and, first, applied, the, categories, of, style, on, a, large, systematic, basis, to, the, history, of, art, he, was, one, of, the, first, to, separate, greek, art, into, periods, and, time, classifications, winckelmann, has, been, called, both, the, prophet, and, founding, hero, of, modern, archaeology, and, the, father, of, the, discipline, of, art, history, the, father, of, archaeological, excavation, was, william, cunnington, 1754, 1810, he, undertook, excavations, in, wiltshire, from, around, 1798, funded, by, sir, richard, colt, hoare, cunnington, made, meticulous, recordings, of, neolithic, and, bronze, age, barrows, and, the, terms, he, used, to, categorize, and, describe, them, are, still, used, by, archaeologists, today, future, u, s, president, thomas, jefferson, also, did, his, own, excavations, in, 1784, using, the, trench, method, on, several, native, american, burial, mounds, in, virginia, his, excavations, were, prompted, by, the, moundbuilders, question, however, his, careful, methods, led, him, to, admit, he, saw, no, reason, why, ancestors, of, the, native, americans, of, his, time, could, not, have, raised, those, mounds, one, of, the, major, achievements, of, 19th, century, archaeology, was, the, development, of, stratigraphy, the, idea, of, overlapping, strata, tracing, back, to, successive, periods, was, borrowed, from, the, new, geological, and, paleontological, work, of, scholars, like, william, smith, james, hutton, and, charles, lyell, the, systematic, application, of, stratigraphy, to, archaeology, first, took, place, with, the, excavations, of, prehistorical, and, bronze, age, sites, in, the, third, and, fourth, decades, of, the, 19th, century, archaeologists, like, jacques, boucher, de, perthes, and, christian, j, rgensen, thomsen, began, to, put, the, artifacts, they, had, found, in, chronological, order, a, major, figure, in, the, development, of, archaeology, into, a, rigorous, science, was, army, officer, and, ethnologist, augustus, pitt, rivers, who, began, excavations, on, his, land, in, england, in, the, 1880s, highly, methodical, by, the, standards, of, the, time, he, is, widely, regarded, as, the, first, scientific, archaeologist, he, arranged, his, artifacts, by, type, or, typology, archaeology, and, within, types, chronologically, this, style, of, arrangement, designed, to, highlight, the, evolutionary, trends, in, human, artifacts, was, of, enormous, significance, for, the, accurate, dating, of, the, objects, his, most, important, methodological, innovation, was, his, insistence, that, all, artifacts, not, just, beautiful, or, unique, ones, be, collected, and, catalogued, william, flinders, petrie, is, another, man, who, may, legitimately, be, called, the, father, of, archaeology, his, painstaking, recording, and, study, of, artifacts, both, in, egypt, and, later, in, palestine, laid, down, many, of, the, ideas, behind, modern, archaeological, recording, he, remarked, that, i, believe, the, true, line, of, research, lies, in, the, noting, and, comparison, of, the, smallest, details, petrie, developed, the, system, of, dating, layers, based, on, pottery, and, ceramic, findings, which, revolutionized, the, chronological, basis, of, egyptology, petrie, was, the, first, to, scientifically, investigate, the, great, pyramid, in, egypt, during, the, 1880s, he, was, also, responsible, for, mentoring, and, training, a, whole, generation, of, egyptologists, including, howard, carter, who, went, on, to, achieve, fame, with, the, discovery, of, the, tomb, of, 14th, century, bc, pharaoh, tutankhamun, the, first, stratigraphic, excavation, to, reach, wide, popularity, with, public, was, that, of, hissarlik, on, the, site, of, ancient, troy, carried, out, by, heinrich, schliemann, frank, calvert, and, wilhelm, d, rpfeld, in, the, 1870s, these, scholars, individuated, nine, different, cities, that, had, overlapped, with, one, another, from, prehistory, to, the, hellenistic, period, meanwhile, the, work, of, sir, arthur, evans, at, knossos, in, crete, revealed, the, ancient, existence, of, an, equally, advanced, minoan, civilization, the, next, major, figure, in, the, development, of, archaeology, was, sir, mortimer, wheeler, whose, highly, disciplined, approach, to, excavation, and, systematic, coverage, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, brought, the, science, on, swiftly, wheeler, developed, the, grid, system, of, excavation, which, was, further, improved, by, his, student, kathleen, kenyon, archaeology, became, a, professional, activity, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, and, it, became, possible, to, study, archaeology, as, a, subject, in, universities, and, even, schools, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, nearly, all, professional, archaeologists, at, least, in, developed, countries, were, graduates, further, adaptation, and, innovation, in, archaeology, continued, in, this, period, when, maritime, archaeology, and, urban, archaeology, became, more, prevalent, and, rescue, archaeology, was, developed, as, a, result, of, increasing, commercial, development, the, purpose, of, archaeology, is, to, learn, more, about, past, societies, and, the, development, of, the, human, race, over, 99, of, the, development, of, humanity, has, occurred, within, prehistoric, cultures, who, did, not, make, use, of, writing, thereby, no, written, records, exist, for, study, purposes, without, such, written, sources, the, only, way, to, understand, prehistoric, societies, is, through, archaeology, because, archaeology, is, the, study, of, past, human, activity, it, stretches, back, to, about, 2, 5, million, years, ago, when, the, first, stone, tools, are, found, the, oldowan, industry, many, important, developments, in, human, history, occurred, during, prehistory, such, as, the, evolution, of, humanity, during, the, paleolithic, period, when, the, hominins, developed, from, the, australopithecines, in, africa, and, eventually, into, modern, homo, sapiens, archaeology, also, sheds, light, on, many, of, humanity, s, technological, advances, for, instance, the, ability, to, use, fire, the, development, of, stone, tools, the, discovery, of, metallurgy, the, beginnings, of, religion, and, the, creation, of, agriculture, without, archaeology, little, or, nothing, would, be, known, about, the, use, of, material, culture, by, humanity, that, pre, dates, writing, however, it, is, not, only, prehistoric, pre, literate, cultures, that, can, be, studied, using, archaeology, but, historic, literate, cultures, as, well, through, the, sub, discipline, of, historical, archaeology, for, many, literate, cultures, such, as, ancient, greece, and, mesopotamia, their, surviving, records, are, often, incomplete, and, biased, to, some, extent, in, many, societies, literacy, was, restricted, to, the, elite, classes, such, as, the, clergy, or, the, bureaucracy, of, court, or, temple, the, literacy, of, aristocrats, has, sometimes, been, restricted, to, deeds, and, contracts, the, interests, and, world, view, of, elites, are, often, quite, different, from, the, lives, and, interests, of, the, populace, writings, that, were, produced, by, people, more, representative, of, the, general, population, were, unlikely, to, find, their, way, into, libraries, and, be, preserved, there, for, posterity, thus, written, records, tend, to, reflect, the, biases, assumptions, cultural, values, and, possibly, deceptions, of, a, limited, range, of, individuals, usually, a, small, fraction, of, the, larger, population, hence, written, records, cannot, be, trusted, as, a, sole, source, the, material, record, may, be, closer, to, a, fair, representation, of, society, though, it, is, subject, to, its, own, biases, such, as, sampling, bias, and, differential, preservation, often, archaeology, provides, the, only, means, to, learn, of, the, existence, and, behaviors, of, people, of, the, past, across, the, millennia, many, thousands, of, cultures, and, societies, and, billions, of, people, have, come, and, gone, of, which, there, is, little, or, no, written, record, or, existing, records, are, misrepresentative, or, incomplete, writing, as, it, is, known, today, did, not, exist, in, human, civilization, until, the, 4th, millennium, bc, in, a, relatively, small, number, of, technologically, advanced, civilizations, in, contrast, homo, sapiens, has, existed, for, at, least, 200, 000, years, and, other, species, of, homo, for, millions, of, years, see, human, evolution, these, civilizations, are, not, coincidentally, the, best, known, they, are, open, to, the, inquiry, of, historians, for, centuries, while, the, study, of, pre, historic, cultures, has, arisen, only, recently, within, a, literate, civilization, many, events, and, important, human, practices, may, not, be, officially, recorded, any, knowledge, of, the, early, years, of, human, civilization, the, development, of, agriculture, cult, practices, of, folk, religion, the, rise, of, the, first, cities, must, come, from, archaeology, in, addition, to, their, scientific, importance, archaeological, remains, sometimes, have, political, or, cultural, significance, to, descendants, of, the, people, who, produced, them, monetary, value, to, collectors, or, strong, aesthetic, appeal, many, people, identify, archaeology, with, the, recovery, of, such, aesthetic, religious, political, or, economic, treasures, rather, than, with, the, reconstruction, of, past, societies, this, view, is, often, espoused, in, works, of, popular, fiction, such, as, raiders, of, the, lost, ark, the, mummy, and, king, solomon, s, mines, when, unrealistic, subjects, are, treated, more, seriously, accusations, of, pseudoscience, are, invariably, levelled, at, their, proponents, see, pseudoarchaeology, however, these, endeavours, real, and, fictional, are, not, representative, of, modern, archaeology, there, is, no, one, approach, to, archaeological, theory, that, has, been, adhered, to, by, all, archaeologists, when, archaeology, developed, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, first, approach, to, archaeological, theory, to, be, practised, was, that, of, cultural, historical, archaeology, which, held, the, goal, of, explaining, why, cultures, changed, and, adapted, rather, than, just, highlighting, the, fact, that, they, did, therefore, emphasizing, historical, particularism, in, the, early, 20th, century, many, archaeologists, who, studied, past, societies, with, direct, continuing, links, to, existing, ones, such, as, those, of, native, americans, siberians, mesoamericans, etc, followed, the, direct, historical, approach, compared, the, continuity, between, the, past, and, contemporary, ethnic, and, cultural, groups, in, the, 1960s, an, archaeological, movement, largely, led, by, american, archaeologists, like, lewis, binford, and, kent, flannery, arose, that, rebelled, against, the, established, cultural, history, archaeology, they, proposed, a, new, archaeology, which, would, be, more, scientific, and, anthropological, with, hypothesis, testing, and, the, scientific, method, very, important, parts, of, what, became, known, as, processual, archaeology, in, the, 1980s, a, new, postmodern, movement, arose, led, by, the, british, archaeologists, michael, shanks, christopher, tilley, daniel, miller, and, ian, hodder, which, has, become, known, as, post, processual, archaeology, it, questioned, processualism, s, appeals, to, scientific, positivism, and, impartiality, and, emphasized, the, importance, of, a, more, self, critical, theoretical, reflexivity, however, this, approach, has, been, criticized, by, processualists, as, lacking, scientific, rigor, and, the, validity, of, both, processualism, and, post, processualism, is, still, under, debate, meanwhile, another, theory, known, as, historical, processualism, has, emerged, seeking, to, incorporate, a, focus, on, process, and, post, processual, archaeology, s, emphasis, of, reflexivity, and, history, archaeological, theory, now, borrows, from, a, wide, range, of, influences, including, systems, theory, neo, evolutionary, thought, phenomenology, postmodernism, agency, theory, cognitive, science, structural, functionalism, marxism, gender, based, and, feminist, archaeology, queer, theory, postcolonial, thoughts, materiality, and, posthumanism, an, archaeological, investigation, usually, involves, several, distinct, phases, each, of, which, employs, its, own, variety, of, methods, before, any, practical, work, can, begin, however, a, clear, objective, as, to, what, the, archaeologists, are, looking, to, achieve, must, be, agreed, upon, this, done, a, site, is, surveyed, to, find, out, as, much, as, possible, about, it, and, the, surrounding, area, second, an, excavation, may, take, place, to, uncover, any, archaeological, features, buried, under, the, ground, and, third, the, information, collected, during, the, excavation, is, studied, and, evaluated, in, an, attempt, to, achieve, the, original, research, objectives, of, the, archaeologists, it, is, then, considered, good, practice, for, the, information, to, be, published, so, that, it, is, available, to, other, archaeologists, and, historians, although, this, is, sometimes, neglected, before, actually, starting, to, dig, in, a, location, remote, sensing, can, be, used, to, look, where, sites, are, located, within, a, large, area, or, provide, more, information, about, sites, or, regions, there, are, two, types, of, remote, sensing, instruments, passive, and, active, passive, instruments, detect, natural, energy, that, is, reflected, or, emitted, from, the, observed, scene, passive, instruments, sense, only, radiation, emitted, by, the, object, being, viewed, or, reflected, by, the, object, from, a, source, other, than, the, instrument, active, instruments, emit, energy, and, record, what, is, reflected, satellite, imagery, is, an, example, of, passive, remote, sensing, here, are, two, active, remote, sensing, instruments, the, archaeological, project, then, continues, or, alternatively, begins, with, a, field, survey, regional, survey, is, the, attempt, to, systematically, locate, previously, unknown, sites, in, a, region, site, survey, is, the, attempt, to, systematically, locate, features, of, interest, such, as, houses, and, middens, within, a, site, each, of, these, two, goals, may, be, accomplished, with, largely, the, same, methods, survey, was, not, widely, practised, in, the, early, days, of, archaeology, cultural, historians, and, prior, researchers, were, usually, content, with, discovering, the, locations, of, monumental, sites, from, the, local, populace, and, excavating, only, the, plainly, visible, features, there, gordon, willey, pioneered, the, technique, of, regional, settlement, pattern, survey, in, 1949, in, the, viru, valley, of, coastal, peru, and, survey, of, all, levels, became, prominent, with, the, rise, of, processual, archaeology, some, years, later, survey, work, has, many, benefits, if, performed, as, a, preliminary, exercise, to, or, even, in, place, of, excavation, it, requires, relatively, little, time, and, expense, because, it, does, not, require, processing, large, volumes, of, soil, to, search, out, artifacts, nevertheless, surveying, a, large, region, or, site, can, be, expensive, so, archaeologists, often, employ, sampling, methods, as, with, other, forms, of, non, destructive, archaeology, survey, avoids, ethical, issues, of, particular, concern, to, descendant, peoples, associated, with, destroying, a, site, through, excavation, it, is, the, only, way, to, gather, some, forms, of, information, such, as, settlement, patterns, and, settlement, structure, survey, data, are, commonly, assembled, into, maps, which, may, show, surface, features, and, or, artifact, distribution, the, simplest, survey, technique, is, surface, survey, it, involves, combing, an, area, usually, on, foot, but, sometimes, with, the, use, of, mechanized, transport, to, search, for, features, or, artifacts, visible, on, the, surface, surface, survey, cannot, detect, sites, or, features, that, are, completely, buried, under, earth, or, overgrown, with, vegetation, surface, survey, may, also, include, mini, excavation, techniques, such, as, augers, corers, and, shovel, test, pits, if, no, materials, are, found, the, area, surveyed, is, deemed, sterile, aerial, survey, is, conducted, using, cameras, attached, to, airplanes, balloons, uavs, or, even, kites, a, bird, s, eye, view, is, useful, for, quick, mapping, of, large, or, complex, sites, aerial, photographs, are, used, to, document, the, status, of, the, archaeological, dig, aerial, imaging, can, also, detect, many, things, not, visible, from, the, surface, plants, growing, above, a, buried, human, made, structure, such, as, a, stone, wall, will, develop, more, slowly, while, those, above, other, types, of, features, such, as, middens, may, develop, more, rapidly, photographs, of, ripening, grain, which, changes, colour, rapidly, at, maturation, have, revealed, buried, structures, with, great, precision, aerial, photographs, taken, at, different, times, of, day, will, help, show, the, outlines, of, structures, by, changes, in, shadows, aerial, survey, also, employs, ultraviolet, infrared, ground, penetrating, radar, wavelengths, lidar, and, thermography, geophysical, survey, can, be, the, most, effective, way, to, see, beneath, the, ground, magnetometers, detect, minute, deviations, in, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, caused, by, iron, artifacts, kilns, some, types, of, stone, structures, and, even, ditches, and, middens, devices, that, measure, the, electrical, resistivity, of, the, soil, are, also, widely, used, archaeological, features, whose, electrical, resistivity, contrasts, with, that, of, surrounding, soils, can, be, detected, and, mapped, some, archaeological, features, such, as, those, composed, of, stone, or, brick, have, higher, resistivity, than, typical, soils, while, others, such, as, organic, deposits, or, unfired, clay, tend, to, have, lower, resistivity, although, some, archaeologists, consider, the, use, of, metal, detectors, to, be, tantamount, to, treasure, hunting, others, deem, them, an, effective, tool, in, archaeological, surveying, examples, of, formal, archaeological, use, of, metal, detectors, include, musketball, distribution, analysis, on, english, civil, war, battlefields, metal, distribution, analysis, prior, to, excavation, of, a, 19th, century, ship, wreck, and, service, cable, location, during, evaluation, metal, detectorists, have, also, contributed, to, archaeology, where, they, have, made, detailed, records, of, their, results, and, refrained, from, raising, artifacts, from, their, archaeological, context, in, the, uk, metal, detectorists, have, been, solicited, for, involvement, in, the, portable, antiquities, scheme, regional, survey, in, underwater, archaeology, uses, geophysical, or, remote, sensing, devices, such, as, marine, magnetometer, side, scan, sonar, or, sub, bottom, sonar, archaeological, excavation, existed, even, when, the, field, was, still, the, domain, of, amateurs, and, it, remains, the, source, of, the, majority, of, data, recovered, in, most, field, projects, it, can, reveal, several, types, of, information, usually, not, accessible, to, survey, such, as, stratigraphy, three, dimensional, structure, and, verifiably, primary, context, modern, excavation, techniques, require, that, the, precise, locations, of, objects, and, features, known, as, their, provenance, or, provenience, be, recorded, this, always, involves, determining, their, horizontal, locations, and, sometimes, vertical, position, as, well, also, see, primary, laws, of, archaeology, likewise, their, association, or, relationship, with, nearby, objects, and, features, needs, to, be, recorded, for, later, analysis, this, allows, the, archaeologist, to, deduce, which, artifacts, and, features, were, likely, used, together, and, which, may, be, from, different, phases, of, activity, for, example, excavation, of, a, site, reveals, its, stratigraphy, if, a, site, was, occupied, by, a, succession, of, distinct, cultures, artifacts, from, more, recent, cultures, will, lie, above, those, from, more, ancient, cultures, excavation, is, the, most, expensive, phase, of, archaeological, research, in, relative, terms, also, as, a, destructive, process, it, carries, ethical, concerns, as, a, result, very, few, sites, are, excavated, in, their, entirety, again, the, percentage, of, a, site, excavated, depends, greatly, on, the, country, and, method, statement, issued, sampling, is, even, more, important, in, excavation, than, in, survey, sometimes, large, mechanical, equipment, such, as, backhoes, jcbs, is, used, in, excavation, especially, to, remove, the, topsoil, overburden, though, this, method, is, increasingly, used, with, great, caution, following, this, rather, dramatic, step, the, exposed, area, is, usually, hand, cleaned, with, trowels, or, hoes, to, ensure, that, all, features, are, apparent, the, next, task, is, to, form, a, site, plan, and, then, use, it, to, help, decide, the, method, of, excavation, features, dug, into, the, natural, subsoil, are, normally, excavated, in, portions, to, produce, a, visible, archaeological, section, for, recording, a, feature, for, example, a, pit, or, a, ditch, consists, of, two, parts, the, cut, and, the, fill, the, cut, describes, the, edge, of, the, feature, where, the, feature, meets, the, natural, soil, it, is, the, feature, s, boundary, the, fill, is, what, the, feature, is, filled, with, and, will, often, appear, quite, distinct, from, the, natural, soil, the, cut, and, fill, are, given, consecutive, numbers, for, recording, purposes, scaled, plans, and, sections, of, individual, features, are, all, drawn, on, site, black, and, white, and, colour, photographs, of, them, are, taken, and, recording, sheets, are, filled, in, describing, the, context, of, each, all, this, information, serves, as, a, permanent, record, of, the, now, destroyed, archaeology, and, is, used, in, describing, and, interpreting, the, site, once, artifacts, and, structures, have, been, excavated, or, collected, from, surface, surveys, it, is, necessary, to, properly, study, them, this, process, is, known, as, post, excavation, analysis, and, is, usually, the, most, time, consuming, part, of, an, archaeological, investigation, it, is, not, uncommon, for, final, excavation, reports, for, major, sites, to, take, years, to, be, published, at, a, basic, level, of, analysis, artifacts, found, are, cleaned, catalogued, and, compared, to, published, collections, this, comparison, process, often, involves, classifying, them, typologically, and, identifying, other, sites, with, similar, artifact, assemblages, however, a, much, more, comprehensive, range, of, analytical, techniques, are, available, through, archaeological, science, meaning, that, artifacts, can, be, dated, and, their, compositions, examined, bones, plants, and, pollen, collected, from, a, site, can, all, be, analyzed, using, the, methods, of, zooarchaeology, paleoethnobotany, palynology, and, stable, isotopes, while, any, texts, can, usually, be, deciphered, these, techniques, frequently, provide, information, that, would, not, otherwise, be, known, and, therefore, they, contribute, greatly, to, the, understanding, of, a, site, computer, graphics, are, now, used, to, build, virtual, 3d, models, of, sites, such, as, the, throne, room, of, an, assyrian, palace, or, ancient, rome, photogrammetry, is, also, used, as, an, analytical, tool, and, digital, topographical, models, have, been, combined, with, astronomical, calculations, to, verify, whether, or, not, certain, structures, such, as, pillars, were, aligned, with, astronomical, events, such, as, the, sun, s, position, at, a, solstice, agent, based, modelling, and, simulation, can, be, used, to, better, understand, past, social, dynamics, and, outcomes, data, mining, can, be, applied, to, large, bodies, of, archaeological, grey, literature, archaeologists, around, the, world, use, drones, to, speed, up, survey, work, and, protect, sites, from, squatters, builders, and, miners, in, peru, small, drones, helped, researchers, produce, three, dimensional, models, of, peruvian, sites, instead, of, the, usual, flat, maps, and, in, days, and, weeks, instead, of, months, and, years, drones, costing, as, little, as, 650, have, proven, useful, in, 2013, drones, have, flown, over, at, least, six, peruvian, archaeological, sites, including, the, colonial, andean, town, machu, llacta, 4, 000, metres, 13, 000, ft, above, sea, level, the, drones, continue, to, have, altitude, problems,

of, the, archaeological, research, done, in, the, united, states, and, much, of, that, in, western, europe, as, well, in, the, us, crm, archaeology, has, been, a, growing, concern, since, the, passage, of, the, national, historic, preservation, act, nhpa, of, 1966, and, most, taxpayers, scholars, and, politicians, believe, that, crm, has, helped, preserve, much, of, that, nation, s, history, and, prehistory, that, would, have, otherwise, been, lost, in, the, expansion, of, cities, dams, and, highways, along, with, other, statutes, the, nhpa, mandates, that, projects, on, federal,

proposed, construction, this, study, involves, at, least, a, cursory, examination, to, determine, whether, or, not, any, significant, archaeological, sites, are, present, in, the, area, affected, by, the, proposed, construction, if, these, do, exist, time, and, money, must, be, allotted, for, their, excavation, if, initial, survey, and, or, test, excavations, indicate, the, presence, of, an,

choose, the, proposal, that, asks, for, the, least, funding, crm, archaeologists, face, considerable, time, pressure, often, being, forced, to, complete, their, work, in, a, fraction, of, the, time, that, might, be, allotted, for, a, purely, scholarly, endeavour, compounding, the, time, pressure, is, the, vetting, process, of, site, reports, that, are, required, in, the, us, to, be, submitted, by, crm, firms, to, the, appropriate, state, historic, preservation, office, shpo, from, the, shpo, s, perspective, there, is, to, be, no, difference, between, a, report, submitted, by, a, crm, firm, operating, under, a, deadline, and, a, multi, year, academic, project, the, result, is, that, for, a, cultural, resource, management, archaeologist, to, be, successful, they, must, be, able, to, produce, academic, quality, documents, at, a, corporate, world, pace, the, annual, ratio, of, open, academic, archaeology, positions, inclusive, of, post, doc, temporary, and, non, tenure, track, appointments, to, the, annual, number, of, archaeology, ma, msc, and, phd, students, is, disproportionate, cultural, resource, management, once, considered, an, intellectual, backwater, for, individuals, with, strong, backs, and, weak, minds, has, attracted, these, graduates, and, crm, offices, are, thus, increasingly, staffed, by, advance, degreed, individuals, with, a, track, record, of, producing, scholarly, articles, but, who, also, have, extensive, crm, field, experience, the, protection, of, archaeological, finds, for, the, public, from, catastrophes, wars, and, armed, conflicts, is, increasingly, being, implemented, internationally, this, happens, on, the, one, hand, through, international, agreements, and, on, the, other, hand, through, organizations, that, monitor, or, enforce, protection, united, nations, unesco, and, blue, shield, international, deal, with, the, protection, of, cultural, heritage, and, thus, also, archaeological, sites, this, also, applies, to, the, integration, of, united, nations, peacekeeping, blue, shield, international, has, undertaken, various, fact, finding, missions, in, recent, years, to, protect, archaeological, sites, during, the, wars, in, libya, syria, egypt, and, lebanon, the, importance, of, archaeological, finds, for, identity, tourism, and, sustainable, economic, growth, is, repeatedly, emphasized, internationally, the, president, of, blue, shield, international, karl, von, habsburg, said, during, a, cultural, property, protection, mission, in, lebanon, in, april, 2019, with, the, united, nations, interim, force, in, lebanon, cultural, assets, are, part, of, the, identity, of, the, people, who, live, in, a, certain, place, if, you, destroy, their, culture, you, also, destroy, their, identity, many, people, are, uprooted, often, have, no, prospects, anymore, and, subsequently, flee, from, their, homeland, early, archaeology, was, largely, an, attempt, to, uncover, spectacular, artifacts, and, features, or, to, explore, vast, and, mysterious, abandoned, cities, and, was, mostly, done, by, upper, class, scholarly, men, this, general, tendency, laid, the, foundation, for, the, modern, popular, view, of, archaeology, and, archaeologists, many, of, the, public, view, archaeology, as, something, only, available, to, a, narrow, demographic, the, job, of, archaeologist, is, depicted, as, a, romantic, adventurist, occupation, and, as, a, hobby, more, than, a, job, in, the, scientific, community, cinema, audiences, form, a, notion, of, who, archaeologists, are, why, they, do, what, they, do, and, how, relationships, to, the, past, are, constituted, and, is, often, under, the, impression, that, all, archaeology, takes, place, in, a, distant, and, foreign, land, only, to, collect, monetarily, or, spiritually, priceless, artifacts, the, modern, depiction, of, archaeology, has, incorrectly, formed, the, public, s, perception, of, what, archaeology, is, much, thorough, and, productive, research, has, indeed, been, conducted, in, dramatic, locales, such, as, cop, n, and, the, valley, of, the, kings, but, the, bulk, of, activities, and, finds, of, modern, archaeology, are, not, so, sensational, archaeological, adventure, stories, tend, to, ignore, the, painstaking, work, involved, in, carrying, out, modern, surveys, excavations, and, data, processing, some, archaeologists, refer, to, such, off, the, mark, portrayals, as, pseudoarchaeology, archaeologists, are, also, very, much, reliant, on, public, support, the, question, of, for, whom, they, are, working, is, often, discussed, motivated, by, a, desire, to, halt, looting, curb, pseudoarchaeology, and, to, help, preserve, archaeological, sites, through, education, and, fostering, public, appreciation, for, the, importance, of, archaeological, heritage, archaeologists, are, mounting, public, outreach, campaigns, they, seek, to, stop, looting, by, combatting, people, who, illegally, take, artifacts, from, protected, sites, and, by, alerting, people, who, live, near, archaeological, sites, of, the, threat, of, looting, common, methods, of, public, outreach, include, press, releases, the, encouragement, of, school, field, trips, to, sites, under, excavation, by, professional, archaeologists, and, making, reports, and, publications, accessible, outside, of, academia, public, appreciation, of, the, significance, of, archaeology, and, archaeological, sites, often, leads, to, improved, protection, from, encroaching, development, or, other, threats, one, audience, for, archaeologists, work, is, the, public, archaeologists, increasingly, realize, that, their, work, can, benefit, non, academic, and, non, archaeological, audiences, and, that, they, have, a, responsibility, to, educate, and, inform, the, public, about, archaeology, local, heritage, awareness, is, aimed, at, increasing, civic, and, individual, pride, through, projects, such, as, community, excavation, projects, and, better, public, presentations, of, archaeological, sites, and, knowledge, the, u, s, dept, of, agriculture, forest, service, usfs, operates, a, volunteer, archaeology, and, historic, preservation, program, called, the, passport, in, time, pit, volunteers, work, with, professional, usfs, archaeologists, and, historians, on, national, forests, throughout, the, u, s, volunteers, are, involved, in, all, aspects, of, professional, archaeology, under, expert, supervision, television, programs, web, videos, and, social, media, can, also, bring, an, understanding, of, underwater, archaeology, to, a, broad, audience, the, mardi, gras, shipwreck, project, integrated, a, one, hour, hd, documentary, short, videos, for, public, viewing, and, video, updates, during, the, expedition, as, part, of, the, educational, outreach, webcasting, is, also, another, tool, for, educational, outreach, for, one, week, in, 2000, and, 2001, live, underwater, video, of, the, queen,

underwater, archaeology, team, in, the, uk, popular, archaeology, programs, such, as, time, team, and, meet, the, ancestors, have, resulted, in, a, huge, upsurge, in, public, interest, where, possible, archaeologists, now, make, more, provisions, for, public, involvement, and, outreach, in, larger, projects, than, they, once, did, and, many, local, archaeological, organizations, operate, within, the, community, archaeology, framework, to, expand, public, involvement, in, smaller, scale, more, local, projects, archaeological, excavation, however, is, best, undertaken, by, well, trained, staff, that, can, work, quickly, and, accurately, often, this, requires, observing, the, necessary, health, and, safety, and, indemnity, insurance, issues, involved, in, working, on, a, modern, building, site, with, tight, deadlines, certain, charities, and, local, government, bodies, sometimes, offer, places, on, research, projects, either, as, part, of, academic, work, or, as, a, defined, community, project, there, is, also, a, flourishing, industry, selling, places, on, commercial, training, excavations, and, archaeological, holiday, tours, archaeologists, prize, local, knowledge, and, often, liaise, with, local, historical, and, archaeological, societies, which, is, one, reason, why, community, archaeology, projects, are, starting, to, become, more, common, often, archaeologists, are, assisted, by, the, public, in, the, locating, of, archaeological, sites, which, professional, archaeologists, have, neither, the, funding, nor, the, time, to, do, archaeological, legacy, institute, ali, is, a, registered, 501, non, profit, media, and, education, corporation, registered, in, oregon, in, 1999, ali, founded, a, website, the, archaeology, channel, to, support, the, organization, s, mission, to, nurturing, and, bringing, attention, to, the, human, cultural, heritage, by, using, media, in, the, most, efficient, and, effective, ways, possible, there, is, a, considerable, international, body, of, research, focused, on, archaeology, and, public, value, and, tangible, benefits, of, archaeology, include, helping, to, counteract, racism, documenting, accomplishments, of, ignored, communities, providing, time, depth, as, a, response, to, short, termism, of, the, modern, age, and, contributing, to, human, ecology, independent, evidence, base, historic, context, development, and, tourism, the, delivery, of, public, benefits, through, archaeology, can, be, summarised, as, follows, through, making, a, contribution, to, a, shared, history, artistic, and, cultural, treasures, local, values, place, making, and, social, cohesion, educational, benefits, contribution, to, science, and, innovation, health, and, wellbeing, and, added, economic, value, to, developers, pseudoarchaeology, is, an, umbrella, term, for, all, activities, that, falsely, claim, to, be, archaeological, but, in, fact, violate, commonly, accepted, and, scientific, archaeological, practices, it, includes, much, fictional, archaeological, work, discussed, above, as, well, as, some, actual, activity, many, non, fiction, authors, have, ignored, the, scientific, methods, of, processual, archaeology, or, the, specific, critiques, of, it, contained, in, post, processualism, an, example, of, this, type, is, the, writing, of, erich, von, d, niken, his, 1968, book, chariots, of, the, gods, together, with, many, subsequent, lesser, known, works, expounds, a, theory, of, ancient, contacts, between, human, civilization, on, earth, and, more, technologically, advanced, extraterrestrial, civilizations, this, theory, known, as, palaeocontact, theory, or, ancient, astronaut, theory, is, not, exclusively, d, niken, s, nor, did, the, idea, originate, with, him, works, of, this, nature, are, usually, marked, by, the, renunciation, of, well, established, theories, on, the, basis, of, limited, evidence, and, the, interpretation, of, evidence, with, a, preconceived, theory, in, mind, looting, of, archaeological, sites, is, an, ancient, problem, for, instance, many, of, the, tombs, of, the, egyptian, pharaohs, were, looted, during, antiquity, archaeology, stimulates, interest, in, ancient, objects, and, people, in, search, of, artifacts, or, treasure, cause, damage, to, archaeological, sites, the, commercial, and, academic, demand, for, artifacts, contributes, directly, to, the, illicit, antiquities, trade, smuggling, of, antiquities, abroad, to, private, collectors, has, caused, great, cultural, and, economic, damage, in, many, countries, whose, governments, lack, the, resources, and, or, the, will, to, deter, it, looters, damage, and, destroy, archaeological, sites, denying, future, generations, information, about, their, ethnic, and, cultural, heritage, indigenous, peoples, especially, lose, access, to, and, control, over, their, cultural, resources, ultimately, denying, them, the, opportunity, to, know, their, past, in, 1937, w, f, hodge, the, director, of, the, southwest, museum, released, a, statement, that, the, museum, would, no, longer, purchase, or, accept, collections, from, looted, contexts, the, first, conviction, of, the, transport, of, artifacts, illegally, removed, from, private, property, under, the, archaeological, resources, protection, act, was, in, 1992, in, the, state, of, indiana, archaeologists, trying, to, protect, artifacts, may, be, placed, in, danger, by, looters, or, locals, trying, to, protect, the, artifacts, from, archaeologists, who, are, viewed, as, looters, by, the, locals, some, historical, archaeology, sites, are, subjected, to, looting, by, metal, detector, hobbyists, who, search, for, artifacts, using, increasingly, advanced, technology, efforts, are, underway, among, all, major, archaeological, organizations, to, increase, education, and, legitimate, cooperation, between, amateurs, and, professionals, in, the, metal, detecting, community, while, most, looting, is, deliberate, accidental, looting, can, occur, when, amateurs, who, are, unaware, of, the, importance, of, archaeological, rigor, collect, artifacts, from, sites, and, place, them, into, private, collections, in, the, united, states, examples, such, as, the, case, of, kennewick, man, have, illustrated, the, tensions, between, native, americans, and, archaeologists, which, can, be, summarized, as, a, conflict, between, a, need, to, remain, respectful, toward, sacred, burial, sites, and, the, academic, benefit, from, studying, them, for, years, american, archaeologists, dug, on, indian, burial, grounds, and, other, places, considered, sacred, removing, artifacts, and, human, remains, to, storage, facilities, for, further, study, in, some, cases, human, remains, were, not, even, thoroughly, studied, but, instead, archived, rather, than, reburied, furthermore, western, archaeologists, views, of, the, past, often, differ, from, those, of, tribal, peoples, the, west, views, time, as, linear, for, many, natives, it, is, cyclic, from, a, western, perspective, the, past, is, long, gone, from, a, native, perspective, disturbing, the, past, can, have, dire, consequences, in, the, present, as, a, consequence, of, this, american, indians, attempted, to, prevent, archaeological, excavation, of, sites, inhabited, by, their, ancestors, while, american, archaeologists, believed, that, the, advancement, of, scientific, knowledge, was, a, valid, reason, to, continue, their, studies, this, contradictory, situation, was, addressed, by, the, native, american, graves, protection, and, repatriation, act, nagpra, 1990, which, sought, to, reach, a, compromise, by, limiting, the, right, of, research, institutions, to, possess, human, remains, due, in, part, to, the, spirit, of, postprocessualism, some, archaeologists, have, begun, to, actively, enlist, the, assistance, of, indigenous, peoples, likely, to, be, descended, from, those, under, study, archaeologists, have, also, been, obliged, to, re, examine, what, constitutes, an, archaeological, site, in, view, of, what, native, peoples, believe, to, constitute, sacred, space, to, many, native, peoples, natural, features, such, as, lakes, mountains, or, even, individual, trees, have, cultural, significance, australian, archaeologists, especially, have, explored, this, issue, and, attempted, to, survey, these, sites, to, give, them, some, protection, from, being, developed, such, work, requires, close, links, and, trust, between, archaeologists, and, the, people, they, are, trying, to, help, and, at, the, same, time, study, while, this, cooperation, presents, a, new, set, of, challenges, and, hurdles, to, fieldwork, it, has, benefits, for, all, parties, involved, tribal, elders, cooperating, with, archaeologists, can, prevent, the, excavation, of, areas, of, sites, that, they, consider, sacred, while, the, archaeologists, gain, the, elders, aid, in, interpreting, their, finds, there, have, also, been, active, efforts, to, recruit, aboriginal, peoples, directly, into, the, archaeological, profession, a, new, trend, in, the, heated, controversy, between, first, nations, groups, and, scientists, is, the, repatriation, of, native, artifacts, to, the, original, descendants, an, example, of, this, occurred, on, 21, june, 2005, when, community, members, and, elders, from, a, number, of, the, 10, algonquian, nations, in, the, ottawa, area, convened, on, the, kitigan, zibi, reservation, near, maniwaki, quebec, to, inter, ancestral, human, remains, and, burial, goods, some, dating, back, 6, 000, years, it, was, not, determined, however, if, the, remains, were, directly, related, to, the, algonquin, people, who, now, inhabit, the, region, the, remains, may, be, of, iroquoian, ancestry, since, iroquoian, people, inhabited, the, area, before, the, algonquin, moreover, the, oldest, of, these, remains, might, have, no, relation, at, all, to, the, algonquin, or, iroquois, and, belong, to, an, earlier, culture, who, previously, inhabited, the, area, the, remains, and, artifacts, including, jewelry, tools, and, weapons, were, originally, excavated, from, various, sites, in, the, ottawa, valley, including, morrison, and, the, allumette, islands, they, had, been, part, of, the, canadian, museum, of, civilization, s, research, collection, for, decades, some, since, the, late, 19th, century, elders, from, various, algonquin, communities, conferred, on, an, appropriate, reburial, eventually, deciding, on, traditional, red, cedar, and, birch, bark, boxes, lined, with, red, cedar, chips, muskrat, and, beaver, pelts, an, inconspicuous, rock, mound, marks, the, reburial, site, where, close, to, 80, boxes, of, various, sizes, are, buried, because, of, this, reburial, no, further, scientific, study, is, possible, although, negotiations, were, at, times, tense, between, the, kitigan, zibi, community, and, museum, they, were, able, to, reach, agreement, african, diaspora, archaeology, is, an, area, of, study, within, the, subfield, of, historical, archaeology, that, studies, those, that, have, been, forcibly, transported, through, the, atlantic, slave, trade, the, trans, saharan, slave, trade, and, the, indian, ocean, slave, trade, as, well, as, their, descendants, although, of, global, relevance, most, research, has, been, conducted, in, the, americas, and, africa, in, the, united, states, similar, to, the, experience, of, native, americans, the, history, of, african, diaspora, archaeology, is, one, of, controversies, over, whiteness, in, archaeology, and, anthropology, a, lack, of, inclusion, of, the, african, descendant, community, and, possession, of, human, remains, in, the, collections, of, universities, and, museums, in, the, 1990s, anthropologist, michael, blakey, was, the, director, of, research, during, the, new, york, african, burial, ground, project, where, he, initiated, a, protocol, for, collaborating, with, the, african, descendant, community, in, 2011, the, society, of, black, archaeologists, was, created, in, the, united, states, co, founders, ayana, omilade, flewellen, archaeologist, at, the, university, of, california, riverside, and, justin, dunnavant, archaeologist, and, assistant, professor, of, anthropology, at, the, university, of, california, los, angeles, intend, to, build, a, restorative, justice, based, structure, in, archaeology, they, suggest, to, define, descendants, not, only, in, genealogical, terms, but, also, to, welcome, input, of, african, americans, whose, ancestors, had, a, shared, historical, experience, in, enslavement, the, united, states, senate, unanimously, passed, a, bill, in, december, 2020, that, centers, african, american, cemeteries, at, risk, in, south, carolina, the, bill, is, made, to, better, protect, historic, african, burial, grounds, and, can, lead, to, the, creation, of, an, african, american, burial, grounds, network, barbados, eight, days, after, becoming, a, republic, on, november, 30, 2021, announced, plans, for, the, construction, of, the, newton, enslaved, burial, ground, memorial, as, well, as, a, museum, dedicated, to, the, history, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, the, ghanaian, british, architect, david, adjaye, is, to, lead, the, project, that, is, to, commemorate, an, estimated, 570, west, africans, buried, in, unmarked, graves, at, the, site, of, the, former, newton, sugar, plantation, barbados, can, be, seen, as, a, good, example, of, respectful, preservation, of, an, african, burial, ground, throughout, the, americas, however, the, burial, grounds, are, in, danger, of, being, destroyed, or, human, remains, are, being, excavated, without, the, descendant, community, being, involved, in, 2022, residents, on, sint, eustatius, dutch, caribbean, spoke, out, strongly, against, what, they, found, were, unethical, excavations, of, their, ancestors, on, the, godet, african, burial, ground, and, the, golden, rock, african, burial, ground, as, anthropogenic, climate, change, affects, our, environment, projections, show, that, there, will, be, changes, in,

temperature, and, frequency, of, heatwaves, rising, sea, levels, and, warmer, seas, ocean, acidification, and, changes, in, oceanic, currents, these, climate, drivers, will, result, in, changes, to, flora, and, fauna, and, changes, in, ground, conditions, both, on, and, below, the, surface, and, so, will, also, affect, archaeological, deposits, and, structures, while, human, responses, to, the, climate, crisis, will, also, impact, archaeological, sites, the, archaeologist, s, knowledge, and, skills, are, relevant, to, supporting, society, in, adapting, to, a, changing, climate, and, a, low, carbon, future, another, effect, of, higher, temperatures, has, been, melting, of, glaciers, and, ice, patches, this, has, led, to, the, discovery, of, artifacts, and, bodies, long, buried, in, the, ice, fostering, the, new, field, of, glacial, archaeology, archaeological, sites, can, be, seen, as, habitats, that, support, ecosystems, and, fulfil, biodiversity, goals, lists
