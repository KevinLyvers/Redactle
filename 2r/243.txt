conquest, of, iran, the, arab, conquest, of, persia, or, the, arab, conquest, of, iran, was, a, major, military, campaign, undertaken, by, the, rashidun, caliphate, between, 632, and, 654, as, part, of, the, early, muslim, conquests, which, had, begun, under, muhammad, in, 622, it, led, to, the, fall, of, the, sasanian, empire, and, the, eventual, decline, of, zoroastrianism, which, had, been, predominant, throughout, persia, as, the, nation, s, official, religion, the, persecution, of, zoroastrians, by, the, early, muslims, during, and, after, this, conflict, prompted, many, of, them, to, flee, eastward, to, india, where, they, were, granted, refuge, by, various, kings, while, arabia, was, experiencing, the, rise, of, islam, in, the, 7th, century, persia, was, struggling, with, unprecedented, levels, of, political, social, economic, and, military, weakness, the, sasanian, army, had, greatly, exhausted, itself, in, the, byzantine, sasanian, war, of, 602, 628, following, the, execution, of, sasanian, shah, khosrow, ii, in, 628, persia, s, internal, political, stability, began, deteriorating, at, a, rapid, pace, subsequently, ten, new, royal, claimants, were, enthroned, within, the, next, four, years, shortly, afterwards, persia, was, further, devastated, by, the, sasanian, interregnum, a, large, scale, civil, war, that, began, in, 628, and, resulted, in, the, government, s, decentralization, by, 632, amidst, persia, s, turmoil, the, first, rashidun, invasion, of, sasanian, territory, took, place, in, 633, when, the, rashidun, army, conquered, parts, of, asoristan, which, was, the, sasanians, political, and, economic, centre, in, mesopotamia, later, the, regional, rashidun, army, commander, khalid, ibn, al, walid, was, transferred, to, oversee, the, muslim, conquest, of, the, levant, and, as, the, rashidun, army, became, increasingly, focused, on, the, byzantine, empire, the, newly, conquered, mesopotamian, territories, were, retaken, by, the, sasanian, army, the, second, rashidun, invasion, began, in, 636, under, sa, d, ibn, abi, waqqas, when, a, key, victory, at, the, battle, of, al, qadisiyyah, permanently, ended, all, sasanian, control, to, the, west, of, modern, day, iran, for, the, next, six, years, the, zagros, mountains, a, natural, barrier, marked, the, political, boundary, between, the, rashidun, caliphate, and, the, sasanian, empire, in, 642, umar, ibn, al, khattab, eight, years, into, his, reign, as, islam, s, second, caliph, ordered, a, full, scale, invasion, of, the, rest, of, the, sasanian, empire, directing, the, war, from, the, city, of, medina, in, arabia, umar, s, quick, conquest, of, persia, in, a, series, of, coordinated, and, multi, pronged, attacks, became, his, greatest, triumph, contributing, to, his, reputation, as, a, great, military, and, political, strategist, in, 644, however, he, was, assassinated, by, the, persian, craftsman, abu, lu, lu, a, firuz, who, had, been, captured, by, rashidun, troops, and, brought, to, arabia, as, a, slave, some, iranian, historians, have, defended, their, forebears, by, using, arab, sources, to, illustrate, that, contrary, to, the, claims, of, some, historians, iranians, in, fact, fought, long, and, hard, against, the, invading, arabs, by, 651, most, of, the, urban, centres, in, iranian, lands, with, the, notable, exception, of, the, provinces, along, the, caspian, sea, i, e, in, tabaristan, and, transoxiana, had, come, under, muslim, domination, many, localities, fought, against, the, invaders, although, the, rashidun, army, had, established, hegemony, over, most, of, the, country, many, cities, rose, in, rebellion, by, killing, their, arab, governors, or, attacking, their, garrisons, eventually, military, reinforcements, quashed, the, iranian, insurgencies, and, imposed, complete, control, the, islamization, of, iran, was, gradual, and, incentivized, in, various, ways, over, a, period, of, centuries, though, some, iranians, never, converted, and, there, is, widespread, evidence, of, zoroastrian, scriptures, and, all, other, pre, islamic, being, systematically, burnt, and, zoroastrian, priests, being, executed, particularly, in, areas, that, were, centers, of, resistance, islam, had, become, iran, s, predominant, religion, by, the, late, middle, ages, the, majority, of, iranians, were, sunni, muslims, until, the, safavids, forcefully, converted, iran, to, shia, islam, in, the, 18th, century, when, western, academics, first, investigated, the, muslim, conquest, of, persia, they, relied, solely, on, the, accounts, of, the, armenian, christian, bishop, sebeos, and, accounts, in, arabic, written, some, time, after, the, events, they, describe, the, most, significant, work, was, probably, that, of, arthur, christensen, and, his, l, iran, sous, les, sassanides, published, in, copenhagen, and, paris, in, 1944, recent, scholarship, has, begun, to, question, the, traditional, narrative, parvaneh, pourshariati, in, her, decline, and, fall, of, the, sasanian, empire, the, sasanian, parthian, confederacy, and, the, arab, conquest, of, iran, published, in, 2008, provides, both, a, detailed, overview, of, the, problematic, nature, of, trying, to, establish, exactly, what, happened, and, a, great, deal, of, original, research, that, questions, fundamental, facts, of, the, traditional, narrative, including, the, timeline, and, specific, dates, pourshariati, s, central, thesis, is, that, contrary, to, what, was, commonly, assumed, the, sassanian, empire, was, highly, decentralized, and, was, in, fact, a, confederation, with, the, parthians, who, themselves, retained, a, high, level, of, independence, despite, their, recent, victories, over, the, byzantine, empire, the, parthians, unexpectedly, withdrew, from, the, confederation, and, the, sassanians, were, thus, ill, prepared, and, ill, equipped, to, mount, an, effective, and, cohesive, defense, against, the, muslim, armies, moreover, the, powerful, northern, and, eastern, parthian, families, the, kust, i, khwarasan, and, kust, i, adurbadagan, withdrew, to, their, respective, strongholds, and, made, peace, with, the, arabs, refusing, to, fight, alongside, the, sassanians, another, important, theme, of, pourshariati, s, study, is, a, re, evaluation, of, the, traditional, timeline, pourshariati, argues, that, the, arab, conquest, of, mesopotamia, took, place, not, as, has, been, conventionally, believed, in, the, years, 632, 634, after, the, accession, of, the, last, sasanian, king, yazdgerd, iii, 632, 651, to, power, but, in, the, period, from, 628, to, 632, an, important, consequence, of, this, change, in, timeline, means, that, the, arab, conquest, started, precisely, when, the, sassanians, and, parthians, were, engaged, in, internecine, warfare, over, succession, to, the, sassanian, throne, since, the, 1st, century, bc, the, border, between, the, roman, later, byzantine, and, parthian, later, sasanian, empires, had, been, the, euphrates, river, the, border, was, constantly, contested, most, battles, and, thus, most, fortifications, were, concentrated, in, the, hilly, regions, of, the, north, as, the, vast, arabian, or, syrian, desert, roman, arabia, separated, the, rival, empires, in, the, south, the, only, dangers, expected, from, the, south, were, occasional, raids, by, nomadic, arab, tribesmen, both, empires, therefore, allied, themselves, with, small, semi, independent, arab, principalities, which, served, as, buffer, states, and, protected, byzantium, and, persia, from, bedouin, attacks, the, byzantine, clients, were, the, ghassanids, the, persian, clients, were, the, lakhmids, the, ghassanids, and, lakhmids, feuded, constantly, which, kept, them, occupied, but, that, did, not, greatly, affect, the, byzantines, or, the, persians, in, the, 6th, and, 7th, centuries, various, factors, destroyed, the, balance, of, power, that, had, held, for, so, many, centuries, the, conflict, with, the, byzantines, greatly, contributed, to, its, weakness, by, draining, sassanid, resources, leaving, it, a, prime, target, for, the, muslims, sasanian, society, was, divided, into, four, classes, priests, warriors, secretaries, and, commoners, the, latter, formed, the, bulk, of, the, population, served, as, its, sole, tax, base, and, remained, its, poorest, class, at, the, climax, of, khosrau, ii, s, ambitious, byzantine, territory, conquests, in, the, levant, and, much, of, asia, minor, taxes, rose, dramatically, and, most, people, could, not, pay, years, of, sassanid, byzantine, wars, had, ruined, trade, routes, and, industry, the, population, s, main, income, sources, the, existing, sassanid, administrative, structure, proved, inadequate, when, faced, with, the, combined, demands, of, a, suddenly, expanded, empire, economy, and, population, rapid, turnover, of, rulers, and, increasing, provincial, landholder, dehqan, power, further, diminished, the, sasanians, over, a, period, of, fourteen, years, and, twelve, successive, kings, the, sassanid, empire, weakened, considerably, and, the, power, of, the, central, authority, passed, into, the, hands, of, its, generals, even, when, a, strong, king, emerged, following, a, series, of, coups, the, sassanids, never, completely, recovered, the, byzantine, clients, the, arab, ghassanids, converted, to, the, monophysite, form, of, christianity, which, was, regarded, as, heretical, by, the, established, byzantine, eastern, orthodox, church, the, byzantines, attempted, to, suppress, the, heresy, alienating, the, ghassanids, and, sparking, rebellions, on, their, desert, frontiers, the, lakhmids, also, revolted, against, the, persian, king, khusrau, ii, nu, man, iii, son, of, al, monder, iv, the, first, christian, lakhmid, king, was, deposed, and, killed, by, khusrau, ii, in, 602, because, of, his, attempt, to, throw, off, persian, suzerainty, after, khusrau, s, assassination, in, 628, the, persian, empire, fractured, and, the, lakhmids, were, effectively, semi, independent, it, is, now, widely, believed, that, the, annexation, of, the, lakhmid, kingdom, was, one, of, the, main, factors, behind, the, fall, of, the, sasanian, empire, and, the, subsequent, islamic, conquest, of, persia, as, the, lakhmids, agreed, to, act, as, spies, for, the, muslims, after, being, defeated, in, the, battle, of, hira, by, khalid, ibn, al, walid, the, persian, ruler, khosrau, ii, parviz, defeated, a, dangerous, rebellion, within, his, own, empire, bahram, chobin, s, rebellion, he, then, turned, his, focus, to, his, traditional, byzantine, enemies, leading, to, the, byzantine, sassanid, war, of, 602, 628, for, a, few, years, he, succeeded, from, 612, to, 622, he, extended, the, persian, borders, almost, to, the, same, extent, that, they, were, under, the, achaemenid, dynasty, 550, 330, bc, capturing, western, states, as, far, as, egypt, palestine, the, conquest, of, the, latter, being, assisted, by, a, jewish, army, and, more, the, byzantines, regrouped, and, pushed, back, in, 622, under, heraclius, khosrau, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, nineveh, in, 627, and, the, byzantines, recaptured, all, of, syria, and, penetrated, far, into, the, persian, provinces, of, mesopotamia, in, 629, khosrau, s, general, shahrbaraz, agreed, to, peace, and, the, border, between, the, two, empires, was, once, again, the, same, as, it, had, been, in, 602, the, plague, of, sheroe, 627, 628, was, one, of, several, epidemics, that, occurred, in, or, close, to, iran, within, two, centuries, after, the, first, epidemic, was, brought, by, the, sasanian, armies, from, its, campaigns, in, constantinople, syria, and, armenia, it, caused, the, death, of, many, aryan, and, therefore, contributed, to, the, fall, of, the, sasanian, empire, khosrau, ii, was, executed, in, 628, and, as, a, result, there, were, numerous, claimants, to, the, throne, from, 628, to, 632, there, were, ten, kings, and, queens, of, persia, the, last, yazdegerd, iii, was, a, grandson, of, khosrau, ii, and, was, said, to, be, a, mere, child, aged, 8, years, after, the, treaty, of, hudaybiyyah, in, 628, islamic, tradition, holds, that, muhammad, sent, many, letters, to, the, princes, kings, and, chiefs, of, the, various, tribes, and, kingdoms, of, the, time, exhorting, them, to, convert, to, islam, and, bow, to, the, order, of, god, these, letters, were, carried, by, ambassadors, to, persia, byzantium, ethiopia, egypt, yemen, and, the, city, of, al, hirah, in, iraq, on, the, same, day, this, assertion, has, been, brought, under, scrutiny, by, some, modern, historians, of, islam, notably, grimme, and, caetani, particularly, in, dispute, is, the, assertion, that, khosrau, ii, received, a, letter, from, muhammad, as, the, sassanid, court, ceremony, was, notoriously, intricate, and, it, is, unlikely, that, a, letter, from, what, at, the, time, was, a, minor, regional, power, would, have, reached, the, hands, of, the, shahanshah, with, regards, to, persia, muslim, histories, further, recount, that, at, the, beginning, of, the, seventh, year, of, migration, muhammad, appointed, one, of, his, officers, abdullah, huzafah, sahmi, qarashi, to, carry, his, letter, to, khosrau, ii, inviting, him, to, convert, in, the, name, of, god, the, beneficent, the, merciful, from, muhammad, the, messenger, of, god, to, the, great, kisra, of, persia, peace, be, upon, him, who, seeks, truth, and, expresses, belief, in, god, and, in, his, prophet, and, testifies, that, there, are, no, gods, but, one, god, whom, has, no, partners, and, who, believes, that, muhammad, is, his, servant, and, prophet, under, the, command, of, god, i, invite, you, to, him, he, has, sent, me, for, the, guidance, of, all, people, so, that, i, may, warn, them, all, of, his, wrath, and, may, present, the, unbelievers, with, an, ultimatum, embrace, islam, so, that, you, may, remain, safe, and, if, you, refuse, to, accept, islam, you, will, be, responsible, for, the, sins, of, the, magi, there, are, differing, accounts, of, the, reaction, of, khosrau, ii, years, of, warfare, between, the, sasanians, and, the, byzantines, as, well, as, the, strain, of, the, khazar, invasion, of, transcaucasia, had, exhausted, the, army, no, effective, ruler, followed, khosrau, ii, causing, chaos, in, society, and, problems, in, the, provincial, administration, until, yazdegerd, iii, rose, to, power, all, these, factors, undermined, the, strength, of, the, persian, army, yazdegerd, iii, was, merely, 8, years, old, when, he, came, to, the, throne, and, lacking, experience, did, not, try, to, rebuild, the, army, the, sasanian, empire, was, highly, decentralized, and, was, in, fact, a, confederation, with, the, parthians, who, themselves, retained, a, high, level, of, independence, after, the, last, sasanian, byzantine, war, the, parthians, wanted, to, withdraw, from, the, confederation, and, the, sasanians, were, thus, ill, prepared, and, ill, equipped, to, mount, an, effective, and, cohesive, defense, against, the, muslim, armies, moreover, the, powerful, northern, and, eastern, parthian, families, the, kust, i, khwarasan, and, kust, i, adurbadagan, withdrew, to, their, respective, strongholds, and, made, peace, with, the, arabs, refusing, to, fight, alongside, the, sasanians, pourshariati, argues, that, the, arab, conquest, of, mesopotamia, took, place, not, as, has, been, conventionally, believed, in, the, years, 632, 634, after, the, accession, of, the, last, sasanian, king, yazdgerd, iii, 632, 651, to, power, but, in, the, period, from, 628, to, 632, an, important, consequence, of, this, change, in, timeline, means, that, the, arab, conquest, started, precisely, when, the, sasanians, and, parthians, were, engaged, in, internecine, warfare, over, who, was, to, succeed, the, sasanian, throne, when, arab, squadrons, made, their, first, raids, into, sasanian, territory, yazdegerd, iii, did, not, consider, them, a, threat, and, he, refused, to, send, an, army, to, encounter, the, invaders, when, the, main, arab, army, reached, the, persian, borders, yazdegerd, iii, procrastinated, in, dispatching, an, army, against, the, arabs, even, rostam, e, farokhzad, who, was, both, eran, spahbod, and, viceroy, did, not, see, the, arabs, as, a, threat, without, opposition, the, arabs, had, time, to, consolidate, and, fortify, their, positions, when, hostilities, between, the, sasanians, and, the, arabs, finally, began, the, persian, army, faced, fundamental, problems, while, their, heavy, cavalry, had, proved, effective, against, the, roman, forces, it, was, too, slow, and, regimented, to, act, with, full, force, against, the, agile, and, unpredictable, lightly, armed, arab, cavalry, and, foot, archers, the, persian, army, had, a, few, initial, successes, war, elephants, temporarily, halted, the, arab, army, but, when, arab, veterans, returned, from, the, syrian, fronts, where, they, had, been, fighting, against, byzantine, forces, they, provided, crucial, instruction, on, how, to, effectively, counter, the, war, elephants, these, factors, contributed, to, the, decisive, sassanid, defeat, at, the, battle, of, al, q, disiyyah, the, persians, who, had, only, one, generation, before, conquered, egypt, and, asia, minor, lost, decisive, battles, when, nimble, lightly, armed, arabs, accustomed, to, skirmishes, and, desert, warfare, attacked, them, the, arab, squadrons, defeated, the, persian, army, in, several, more, battles, culminating, in, the, battle, of, nah, vand, the, last, major, battle, of, the, sassanids, the, sassanid, dynasty, came, to, an, end, with, the, death, of, yazdegerd, iii, in, 651, muhammad, died, in, june, 632, and, abu, bakr, took, the, title, of, caliph, and, political, successor, at, medina, soon, after, abu, bakr, s, succession, several, arab, tribes, revolted, in, the, ridda, wars, arabic, for, the, wars, of, apostasy, the, ridda, wars, preoccupied, the, caliphate, until, march, 633, and, ended, with, the, entirety, of, the, arab, peninsula, under, the, authority, of, the, caliph, at, medina, abu, bakr, set, in, motion, a, historical, trajectory, continued, later, by, umar, and, uthman, that, in, a, few, decades, led, to, one, of, the, largest, empires, in, history, beginning, with, a, confrontation, with, the, sassanid, empire, under, the, general, khalid, ibn, al, walid, after, the, ridda, wars, a, tribal, chief, of, northeastern, arabia, al, muthanna, ibn, haritha, raided, the, sasanian, towns, in, mesopotamia, actions, that, generated, a, considerable, amount, of, booty, was, collected, al, muthanna, ibn, haritha, went, to, medina, to, inform, abu, bakr, about, his, success, and, was, appointed, commander, of, his, people, after, which, he, began, to, raid, deeper, into, mesopotamia, using, the, mobility, of, his, light, cavalry, he, could, easily, raid, any, town, near, the, desert, and, disappear, again, into, the, desert, beyond, the, reach, of, the, sasanian, army, al, muthanna, s, acts, made, abu, bakr, think, about, the, expansion, of, the, rashidun, caliphate, to, ensure, victory, abu, bakr, used, a, volunteer, army, and, put, his, best, general, khalid, ibn, al, walid, in, command, after, defeating, the, self, proclaimed, prophet, musaylimah, in, the, battle, of, yamama, khalid, was, still, at, al, yamama, when, abu, bakr, ordered, him, to, invade, the, sasanian, empire, making, al, hirah, the, objective, of, khalid, abu, bakr, sent, reinforcements, and, ordered, the, tribal, chiefs, of, northeastern, arabia, al, muthanna, ibn, haritha, mazhur, bin, adi, harmala, and, sulma, to, operate, under, khalid, s, command,

embrace, islam, or, pay, tribute, khalid, did, not, receive, any, responses, and, continued, with, his, tactical, plans, khalid, went, on, to, win, decisive, victories, in, four, consecutive, battles,

in, the, battle, of, dawmat, al, jandal, in, the, last, week, of, august, upon, his, return, he, received, news, of, the, assembling, of, a, large, persian, army, he, decided, to, defeat, them, all, separately, to, avoid, the, risk, of, being, defeated, by, a, large, unified, persian, army, four, divisions, of, persian, and, christian, arab, auxiliaries, were, present, at, hanafiz, zumiel, sanni, and, muzieh, khalid, divided, his, army, into, three, units, and, employed, them, in, well, coordinated, attacks, against, the, persians, from, three, different, sides, at, night, in, the, battle, of, muzayyah, then, the, battle, of, saniyy, and, finally, the, battle, of, zumail, all, during, the, month, of, november, these, devastating, defeats, ended, persian, control, over, mesopotamia, and, left, the, persian, capital, ctesiphon, vulnerable, before, attacking, ctesiphon, khalid, decided, to, eliminate, all, persian, forces, in, the, south, and, west, he, accordingly, marched, against, the, border, city, of, firaz, where, he, defeated, the, combined, forces, of, the, sasanian, persians, the, byzantines, and, christian, arabs, in, december, this, was, the, last, battle, in, his, conquest, of, mesopotamia, while, khalid, was, on, his, way, to, attack, qadissiyah, a, key, fort, en, route, to, ctesiphon, abu, bakr, ordered, him, to, the, roman, front, in, syria, to, assume, command, there, according, to, the, will, of, abu, bakr, umar, was, to, continue, the, conquest, of, syria, and, mesopotamia, on, the, northeastern, borders, of, the, empire, in, mesopotamia, the, situation, was, rapidly, deteriorating, during, abu, bakr, s, era, khalid, ibn, al, walid, had, left, mesopotamia, with, half, his, army, of, 9000, soldiers, to, assume, command, in, syria, whereupon,

adopted, a, new, offensive, policy, preparing, to, launch, a, full, scale, invasion, of, what, remained, of, the, sasanian, empire, the, battle, of, nahavand, was, one, of, the, most, decisive, battles, in, islamic, history, and, proved, to, be, the, key, to, persia, after, the, devastating, defeat, at, nahavand, the, last, sassanid, emperor, yazdegerd, iii, fled, to, different, parts, of, persia, to, raise, a, new, army, with, limited, success, while, umar, attempted, to, capture, him, umar, decided, to, strike, the, persians, immediately, after, their, defeat, at, nahavand, while, he,

umar, chose, isfahan, as, it, was, the, heart, of, the, persian, empire, and, a, conduit, for, supply, and, communications, among, the, sasanian, garrisons, and, its, capture, would, isolate, fars, and, azerbaijan, from, khorasan, yazdegerd, s, stronghold, after, he, had, taken, fars, and, isfahan, the, next, attacks, would, be, simultaneously, launched, against, azerbaijan, the, northwestern,

conquest, of, sassanid, persia, preparations, were, complete, by, january, 642, the, success, of, the, plan, depended, upon, how, effectively, umar, could, coordinate, these, attacks, from, medina, about, 1500, kilometers, from, persia, and, upon, the, skill, of, his, field, commanders, umar, adopted, a, different, approach, to, the, command, structure, instead, of, appointing, a, single, field, commander, to, press, the, campaign, umar, appointed, several, commanders, each, assigned, a, different, mission, once, a, commander, s, mission, ended, he, would, become, an, ordinary, soldier, under, the, new, field, commander, for, the, latter, s, mission, the, purpose, of, this, strategy, was, to, allow, commanders, to, mix, with, their, soldiers, and, to, remind, them, that, they, are, like, everyone, else, command, is, only, given, to, the, most, competent, and, once, the, battle, is, over, the, commander, returns, to, his, previous, position, on, the, eve, of, the, campaign, umar,

umar, over, something, as, trivial, as, a, tax, burden, ubayd, allah, s, retaliatory, killing, of, apparently, random, non, arabs, bears, witness, to, the, strong, tensions, that, existed, between, arabs, and, non, arabs, in, the, early, islamic, caliphate, uthman, ibn, affan, 644, 656, succeeded, umar, as, caliph, during, his, reign, almost, the, whole, of, the, former, sassanid, empire, s, territory, rebelled, from, time, to, time, requiring, him, to, send, several, military, expeditions, to, crush, the, rebellions, and, recapture, persia, and, its, vassal, states, the, main,

borders, of, the, sasanian, empire, to, transoxiana, baluchistan, and, the, caucasus, for, many, decades, to, come, this, was, the, easternmost, limit, of, muslim, rule, according, to, bernard, lewis, arab, muslims, conquests, have, been, variously, seen, in, iran, by, some, as, a, blessing, the, advent, of, the, true, faith, the, end, of, the, age, of, ignorance, and, heathenism, by, others, as, a, humiliating, national, defeat, the, conquest, and, subjugation, of, the, country, by, foreign, invaders, both, perceptions, are, of, course, valid, depending, on, one, s, angle, of, vision, iran, was, islamized, but, it, was, not, arabized, persians, remained, persians, and, after, an, interval, of, silence, iran, reemerged, as, a, separate, different, and, distinctive, element, within, islam, eventually, adding, a, new, element, even, to, islam, itself, culturally, politically, and, most, remarkable, of, all, even, religiously, the, iranian, contribution, to, this, new, islamic, civilization, is, of, immense, importance, the, work, of, iranians, can, be, seen, in, every, field, of, cultural, endeavor, including, arabic, poetry, to, which, poets, of, iranian, origin, composing, their, poems, in, arabic, made, a, very, significant, contribution, in, a, sense, iranian, islam, is, a, second, advent, of, islam, itself, a, new, islam, sometimes, referred, to, as, islam, i, ajam, it, was, this, persian, islam, rather, than, the, original, arab, islam, that, was, brought, to, new, areas, and, new, peoples, to, the, turks, first, in, central, asia, and, then, in, the, middle, east, in, the, country, which, came, to, be, called, turkey, and, of, course, to, india, the, ottoman, turks, brought, a, form, of, iranian, civilization, to, the, walls, of, vienna, under, umar, and, his, immediate, successors, the, arab, conquerors, attempted, to, maintain, their, political, and, cultural, cohesion, despite, the, attractions, of, the, civilizations, they, had, conquered, the, arabs, initially, settled, in, the, garrison, towns, rather, than, on, scattered, estates, the, new, non, muslim, subjects, were, protected, by, the, state, and, known, as, dhimmi, protected, and, were, to, pay, a, special, tax, the, jizya, tribute, which, was, calculated, at, varying, individual, rates, usually, two, dirhams, for, able, bodied, men, of, military, age, in, return, for, exemption, from, military, service, women, and, children, were, exempted, from, the, jizya, mass, conversions, were, neither, desired, nor, allowed, at, least, in, the, first, few, centuries, of, arab, rule, umar, is, reported, to, have, issued, the, following, instructions, about, the, protected, people, make, it, easy, for, him, who, can, not, pay, tribute, help, him, who, is, weak, let, them, keep, their, titles, but, do, not, give, them, our, kuniyat, umar, s, liberal, policies, were, continued, by, at, least, his, immediate, successors, in, his, dying, charge, to, uthman, he, is, reported, to, have, said, i, charge, the, caliph, after, me, to, be, kind, to, the, dhimmis, to, keep, their, covenant, to, protect, them, and, not, to, burden, them, over, their, strength, as, a, matter, of, practicality, the, jizya, replaced, the, sasanian, poll, taxes, which, tended, to, be, much, higher, than, the, jizya, in, addition, to, the, jizya, the, old, sasanian, land, tax, known, in, arabic, as, kharaj, was, also, adopted, umar, is, said, to, have, occasionally, set, up, commissions, to, survey, tax, burdens, in, order, to, ensure, that, they, wouldn, t, be, more, than, the, land, could, bear, it, is, reported, that, zoroastrians, were, subjected, to, humiliation, and, ridicule, when, paying, the, jizya, in, order, to, make, them, feel, inferior, at, least, under, the, rashiduns, and, early, ummayads, the, administrative, system, of, the, late, sasanian, period, was, largely, retained, a, pyramidal, system, where, each, quarter, of, the, state, was, divided, into, provinces, the, provinces, into, districts, and, the, districts, into, sub, districts, provinces, were, called, ustan, middle, persian, ostan, and, the, districts, shahrs, centered, upon, a, district, capital, known, as, a, shahristan, the, subdistricts, were, called, tasok, in, middle, persian, which, was, adopted, into, arabic, as, tassuj, plural, tasasij, zoroastrians, were, made, to, pay, an, extra, tax, called, jizya, or, be, killed, enslaved, or, imprisoned, those, paying, jizya, were, subjected, to, insults, and, humiliation, by, the, tax, collectors, zoroastrians, who, were, captured, as, slaves, in, wars, were, given, their, freedom, if, they, converted, to, islam, while, giving, freedom, of, choice, the, arab, conquerors, designated, privileges, for, those, who, converted, to, islam, the, conversion, process, was, slow, and, uncompleted, stretching, over, many, centuries, with, a, majority, of, persians, still, following, zoroastrianism, at, the, turn, of, the, millennium, muslim, leaders, in, their, effort, to, win, converts, encouraged, attendance, at, muslim, prayer, with, promises, of, money, and, allowed, the, quran, to, be, recited, in, persian, instead, of, arabic, so, that, it, would, be, intelligible, to, all, islam, was, readily, accepted, by, zoroastrians, who, were, employed, in, industrial, and, artisan, positions, because, according, to, zoroastrian, dogma, such, occupations, that, involved, defiling, fire, made, them, impure, moreover, muslim, missionaries, did, not, encounter, difficulty, in, explaining, islamic, tenets, to, zoroastrians, as, there, were, many, similarities, between, the, faiths, according, to, thomas, walker, arnold, the, persian, would, meet, ahura, mazda, and, ahriman, under, the, names, of, allah, and, iblis, in, afghanistan, islam, was, spread, due, to, umayyad, missionary, efforts, particularly, under, the, reigns, of, hisham, ibn, abd, al, malik, and, umar, ibn, abd, al, aziz, there, were, also, large, and, thriving, christian, and, jewish, communities, along, with, smaller, numbers, of, buddhists, and, other, groups, the, population, moved, slowly, and, steadily, toward, islam, the, nobility, and, citizens, converted, first, islam, spread, more, slowly, among, the, peasantry, and, the, dihqans, or, landed, gentry, by, the, late, 10th, century, the, majority, of, the, persians, had, become, muslim, until, the, 15th, century, most, persian, muslims, were, sunni, muslims, with, the, rise, of, the, safavids, in, the, early, 16th, century, and, their, forced, conversion, of, sunnis, shi, a, islam, came, to, dominate, the, land, during, the, rashidun, caliphate, the, official, language, of, persia, including, mesopotamia, remained, middle, persian, pahlavi, just, as, the, official, languages, of, syria, and, egypt, remained, greek, and, coptic, during, the, umayyad, caliphate, the, ummayads, made, arabic, the, primary, language, of, their, subjected, people, throughout, their, empire, displacing, their, indigenous, languages, particularly, al, hajjaj, ibn, yusuf, 661, 714, officially, changed, the, administrative, language, of, iraq, from, middle, persian, pahlavi, to, arabic, although, an, area, from, iraq, to, morocco, speaks, arabic, based, dialects, to, this, day, middle, persian, proved, to, be, much, more, enduring, most, of, its, structure, and, vocabulary, survived, evolving, into, new, persian, persian, incorporated, a, certain, amount, of, arabic, vocabulary, especially, words, pertaining, to, religion, and, it, switched, from, the, pahlavi, scripts, to, a, modified, version, of, the, arabic, alphabet, today, persian, is, spoken, officially, in, iran, afghanistan, and, tajikistan, the, arab, conquest, of, persia, led, to, a, period, of, extreme, urbanisation, in, iran, starting, with, the, ascension, of, the, abbasid, dynasty, and, ending, in, the, 11th, century, ce, this, was, particularly, true, for, the, eastern, parts, of, the, country, for, regions, like, khorasan, and, transoxiana, during, this, period, iran, saw, the, development, of, massive, metropolises, some, reaching, population, numbers, of, up, to, 200, 000, people, this, period, of, extreme, urbanisation, was, followed, in, the, late, 11th, and, early, 12th, century, by, a, collapse, of, the, iranian, economy, which, led, to, large, scale, emigrations, of, iranians, into, central, asia, india, the, rest, of, the, middle, east, and, anatolia, this, catastrophe, has, been, cited, by, some, as, reason, for, the, persian, language, becoming, widespread, throughout, central, asia, and, large, parts, of, the, middle, east
