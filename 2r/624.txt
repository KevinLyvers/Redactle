mentioned, in, the, ketuvim, of, the, hebrew, bible, by, the, name, shushan, mainly, in, the, book, of, esther, but, also, once, each, in, the, books, of, ezra, ezra, 4, 9, nehemiah, nehemiah, 1, 1,

however, a, large, portion, of, the, current, structure, is, actually, a, much, later, construction, dated, to, the, late, nineteenth, century, c, 1871, susa, is, further, mentioned, in, the, book, of, jubilees, 8, 21, 9, 2, as, one, of, the, places, within, the, inheritance, of, shem, and, his, eldest, son, elam, and, in, 8, 1, susan, is, also, named, as, the, son, or, daughter, in, some, translations, of, elam, the, site, was, examined, in, 1836, by, henry, rawlinson, and, then, by, a, h, layard, in, 1851, some, modest, excavation, was, done, by, william, loftus, accompanied, by, fenwick, williams, who, identified, it, as, susa, among, his, finds, was, a, jar, containing, a, around, 110, coins, the, earliest, of, which, was, dated, to, 697, 98, ad, in, 1885, and, 1886, marcel, auguste, dieulafoy, and, jane, dieulafoy, began, the, first, french, excavations, discovering, glazed, bricks, column, bases, and, capitals, from, the, palace, of, the, achaemenid, kings, however, they, failed, to, identify, mudbrick, walls, which, were, then, destroyed, in, the, course, of, excavation, almost, all, of, the, excavations, at, susa, post, 1885, were, organized, and, authorized, by, the, french, government, in, two, treaties, in, 1894, and, 1899, the, french, gained, a, monopoly, on, all, archaeological, excavations, in, iran, indefinitely, jacques, de, morgan, after, visiting, the, site, in, 1891, conducted, major, excavations, from, 1897, until, 1911, the, excavations, that, were, conducted, in, susa, brought, many, artistic, and, historical, artifacts, back, to, france, these, artifacts, filled, multiple, halls, in, the, museum, of, the, louvre, throughout, the, late, 1890s, and, early, 1900s, de, morgan, s, most, important, work, was, the, excavation, of, the, grande, tranch, e, in, the, acropole, mound, where, he, found, the, stele, of, naram, sin, a, collection, of, babylonian, kudurrus, boundary, stones, the, stele, bearing, the, code, of, hammurabi, an, ornamented, bronze, table, of, snakes, the, bronze, statue, of, queen, napir, asu, and, thousands, of, inscribed, bricks, his, finds, showed, susa, to, be, the, most, important, center, of, elamite, civilization, which, was, effectively, discovered, by, the, french, mission, at, susa, excavation, efforts, continued, under, roland, de, mecquenem, until, 1914, at, the, beginning, of, world, war, i, french, work, at, susa, resumed, after, the, war, led, by, de, mecquenem, continuing, until, world, war, ii, in, 1940, to, supplement, the, original, publications, of, de, mecquenem, the, archives, of, his, excavation, have, now, been, put, online, thanks, to, a, grant, from, the, shelby, white, levy, program, roman, ghirshman, took, over, direction, of, the, french, efforts, in, 1946, after, the, end, of, the, war, together, with, his, wife, tania, ghirshman, he, continued, there, until, 1967, the, ghirshmans, concentrated, on, excavating, a, single, part, of, the, site, the, hectare, sized, ville, royale, taking, it, all, the, way, down, to, bare, earth, the, pottery, found, at, the, various, levels, enabled, a, stratigraphy, to, be, developed, for, susa, from, 1969, until, 1979, excavations, were, conducted, under, jean, perrot, in, 2019, the, susa, salvage, project, was, launched, to, counter, the, construction, of, a, transportation, underpass, in, the, vicinity, of, the, site, in, urban, history, susa, is, one, of, the, oldest, known, settlements, of, the, region, based, on, calibrated, carbon, 14, dating, the, foundation, of, a, settlement, there, occurred, as, early, as, 4395, bc, in, the, region, around, susa, were, a, number, of, towns, with, their, own, platforms, and, villages, that, maintained, a, trading, relationship, with, the, city, especially, those, along, the, zagro, frontier, the, founding, of, susa, corresponded, with, the, abandonment, of, nearby, villages, potts, suggests, that, the, settlement, may, have, been, founded, to, try, to, reestablish, the, previously, destroyed, settlement, at, chogha, mish, about, 25, km, to, the, west, previously, chogha, mish, was, a, very, large, settlement, and, it, featured, a, similar, massive, platform, that, was, later, built, at, susa, another, important, settlement, in, the, area, is, chogha, bonut, which, was, discovered, in, 1976, shortly, after, susa, was, first, settled, over, 6000, years, ago, its, inhabitants, erected, a, monumental, platform, that, rose, over, the, flat, surrounding, landscape, the, exceptional, nature, of, the, site, is, still, recognizable, today, in, the, artistry, of, the, ceramic, vessels, that, were, placed, as, offerings, in, a, thousand, or, more, graves, near, the, base, of, the, temple, platform, susa, s, earliest, settlement, is, known, as, the, susa, i, period, c, 4200, 3900, bc, two, settlements, named, by, archaeologists, the, acropolis, 7, ha, and, the, apadana, 6, 3, ha, would, later, merge, to, form, susa, proper, 18, ha, the, apadana, was, enclosed, by, 6, metre, thick, walls, of, rammed, earth, this, particular, place, is, named, apadana, because, it, also, contains, a, late, achaemenid, structure, of, this, type, nearly, two, thousand, pots, of, susa, i, style, were, recovered, from, the, cemetery, most, of, them, now, in, the, louvre, the, vessels, found, are, eloquent, testimony, to, the, artistic, and, technical, achievements, of, their, makers, and, they, hold, clues, about, the, organization, of, the, society, that, commissioned, them, painted, ceramic, vessels, from, susa, in, the, earliest, first, style, are, a, late, regional, version, of, the, mesopotamian, ubaid, ceramic, tradition, that, spread, across, the, near, east, during, the, fifth, millennium, bc, susa, i, style, was, very, much, a, product, of, the, past, and, of, influences, from, contemporary, ceramic, industries, in, the, mountains, of, western, iran, the, recurrence, in, close, association, of, vessels, of, three, types, a, drinking, goblet, or, beaker, a, serving, dish, and, a, small, jar, implies, the, consumption, of, three, types, of, food, apparently, thought, to, be, as, necessary, for, life, in, the, afterworld, as, it, is, in, this, one, ceramics, of, these, shapes, which, were, painted, constitute, a, large, proportion, of, the, vessels, from, the, cemetery, others, are, coarse, cooking, type, jars, and, bowls, with, simple, bands, painted, on, them, and, were, probably, the, grave, goods, of, the, sites, of, humbler, citizens, as, well, as, adolescents, and, perhaps, children, the, pottery, is, carefully, made, by, hand, although, a, slow, wheel, may, have, been, employed, the, asymmetry, of, the, vessels, and, the, irregularity, of, the, drawing, of, encircling, lines, and, bands, indicate, that, most, of, the, work, was, done, freehand, copper, metallurgy, is, also, attested, during, this, period, which, was, contemporary, with, metalwork, at, some, highland, iranian, sites, such, as, tepe, sialk, as, many, as, 40, copper, axes, have, been, found, at, the, susa, cemetery, as, well, as, 10, round, discs, probably, used, as, mirrors, many, awls, and, spatulas, were, also, found, the, cemetery, of, chega, sofla, from, the, same, timeframe, provides, a, lot, of, similar, material, with, many, sophisticated, metal, objects, chega, sofla, is, located, in, the, same, geographical, area, susa, came, within, the, uruk, cultural, sphere, during, the, uruk, period, an, imitation, of, the, entire, state, apparatus, of, uruk, proto, writing, cylinder, seals, with, sumerian, motifs, and, monumental, architecture, is, found, at, susa, according, to, some, scholars, susa, may, have, been, a, colony, of, uruk, there, is, some, dispute, about, the, comparative, periodization, of, susa, and, uruk, at, this, time, as, well, as, about, the, extent, of, uruk, influence, in, susa, recent, research, indicates, that, early, uruk, period, corresponds, to, susa, ii, period, daniel, t, potts, argues, that, the, influence, from, the, highland, iranian, khuzestan, area, in, susa, was, more, significant, at, the, early, period, and, also, continued, later, on, thus, susa, combined, the, influence, of, two, cultures, from, the, highland, area, and, from, the, alluvial, plains, potts, also, stresses, the, fact, that, the, writing, and, numerical, systems, of, uruk, were, not, simply, borrowed, in, susa, wholesale, rather, only, partial, and, selective, borrowing, took, place, that, was, adapted, to, susa, s, needs, despite, the, fact, that, uruk, was, far, larger, than, susa, at, the, time, susa, was, not, its, colony, but, still, maintained, some, independence, for, a, long, time, according, to, potts, an, architectural, link, has, also, been, suggested, between, susa, tal, i, malyan, and, godin, tepe, at, this, time, in, support, of, the, idea, of, the, parallel, development, of, the, proto, cuneiform, and, proto, elamite, scripts, some, scholars, believe, that, susa, was, part, of, the, greater, uruk, culture, holly, pittman, an, art, historian, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, in, philadelphia, says, they, susanians, are, participating, entirely, in, an, uruk, way, of, life, they, are, not, culturally, distinct, the, material, culture, of, susa, is, a, regional, variation, of, that, on, the, mesopotamian, plain, gilbert, stein, director, of, the, university, of, chicago, s, oriental, institute, says, that, an, expansion, once, thought, to, have, lasted, less, than, 200, years, now, apparently, went, on, for, 700, years, it, is, hard, to, think, of, any, colonial, system, lasting, that, long, the, spread, of, uruk, material, is, not, evidence, of, uruk, domination, it, could, be, local, choice, susa, iii, 3100, 2700, bc, is, also, known, as, the, proto, elamite, period, at, this, time, banesh, period, pottery, is, predominant, this, is, also, when, the, proto, elamite, tablets, first, appear, in, the, record, subsequently, susa, became, the, centre, of, elam, civilization, ambiguous, reference, to, elam, cuneiform, appear, also, in, this, period, in, sumerian, records, susa, enters, recorded, history, in, the, early, dynastic, period, of, sumer, a, battle, between, kish, and, susa, is, recorded, in, 2700, bc, when, en, me, barage, si, is, said, to, have, made, the, land, of, elam, submit, in, the, sumerian, period, susa, was, the, capital, of, a, state, called, susiana, u, an, which, occupied, approximately, the, same, territory, of, modern, kh, zest, n, province, centered, on, the, karun, river, control, of, susiana, shifted, between, elam, sumer, and, akkad, during, the, elamite, monarchy, many, riches, and, materials, were, brought, to, susa, from, the, plundering, of, other, cities, this, was, mainly, due, to, the, fact, of, susa, s, location, on, iran, s, south, eastern, region, closer, to, the, city, of, babylon, and, cities, in, mesopotamia, the, use, of, the, elamite, language, as, an, administrative, language, was, first, attested, in, texts, of, ancient, ansan, tall, e, mal, yan, dated, 1000, bc, previous, to, the, era, of, elamites, the, akkadian, language, was, responsible, for, most, or, all, of, the, text, used, in, ancient, documents, susiana, was, incorporated, by, sargon, the, great, into, his, akkadian, empire, in, approximately, 2330, bc, the, main, goddess, of, the, city, was, nanaya, who, had, a, significant, temple, in, susa, the, old, elamite, period, began, around, 2700, bc, historical, records, mention, the, conquest, of, elam, by, enmebaragesi, the, sumerian, king, of, kish, in, mesopotamia, three, dynasties, ruled, during, this, period, twelve, kings, of, each, of, the, first, two, dynasties, those, of, awan, or, avan, c, 2400, 2100, bc, and, simashki, c, 2100, 1970, bc, are, known, from, a, list, from, susa, dating, to, the, old, babylonian, period, two, elamite, dynasties, said, to, have, exercised, brief, control, over, parts, of, sumer, in, very, early, times, include, awan, and, hamazi, and, likewise, several, of, the, stronger, sumerian, rulers, such, as, eannatum, of, lagash, and, lugal, anne, mundu, of, adab, are, recorded, as, temporarily, dominating, elam, susa, was, the, capital, of, an, akkadian, province, until, ca, 2100, bc, when, its, governor, kutik, inshushinak, rebelled, and, made, it, an, independent, state, and, a, literary, center, also, he, was, the, last, from, the, awan, dynasty, according, to, the, susa, kinglist, he, unified, the, neighbouring, territories, and, became, the, king, of, elam, he, encouraged, the, use, of, the, linear, elamite, script, that, remains, undeciphered, the, city, was, subsequently, conquered, by, the, neo, sumerian, third, dynasty, of, ur, and, held, until, ur, finally, collapsed, at, the, hands, of, the, elamites, under, kindattu, in, ca, 2004, bc, at, this, time, susa, was, ruled, by, elam, again, and, became, its, capital, under, the, shimashki, dynasty, numerous, artifacts, of, indus, valley, civilization, origin, have, been, found, in, susa, from, this, period, especially, seals, and, etched, carnelian, beads, pointing, to, indus, mesopotamia, relations, during, this, period, around, 1500, bc, the, middle, elamite, period, began, with, the, rise, of, the, anshanite, dynasties, their, rule, was, characterized, by, an, elamisation, of, susa, and, the, kings, took, the, title, king, of, anshan, and, susa, while, previously, the, akkadian, language, was, frequently, used, in, inscriptions, the, succeeding, kings, such, as, the, igihalkid, dynasty, of, c, 1400, bc, tried, to, use, elamite, thus, elamite, language, and, culture, grew, in, importance, in, susiana, this, was, also, the, period, when, the, elamite, pantheon, was, being, imposed, in, susiana, this, policy, reached, its, height, with, the, construction, of, the, political, and, religious, complex, at, chogha, zanbil, 30, km, 19, mi, south, east, of, susa, in, ca, 1175, bc, the, elamites, under, shutruk, nahhunte, plundered, the, original, stele, bearing, the, code, of, hammurabi, and, took, it, to, susa, archeologists, found, it, in, 1901, nebuchadnezzar, i, of, the, babylonian, empire, plundered, susa, around, fifty, years, later, in, 647, bc, neo, assyrian, king, ashurbanipal, leveled, the, city, during, a, war, in, which, the, people, of, susa, participated, on, the, other, side, a, tablet, unearthed, in, 1854, by, austen, henry, layard, in, nineveh, reveals, ashurbanipal, as, an, avenger, seeking, retribution, for, the, humiliations, that, the, elamites, had, inflicted, on, the, mesopotamians, over, the, centuries, susa, the, great, holy, city, abode, of, their, gods, seat, of, their, mysteries, i, conquered, i, entered, its, palaces, i, opened, their, treasuries, where, silver, and, gold, goods, and, wealth, were, amassed, i, destroyed, the, ziggurat, of, susa, i, smashed, its, shining, copper, horns, i, reduced, the, temples, of, elam, to, naught, their, gods, and, goddesses, i, scattered, to, the, winds, the, tombs, of, their, ancient, and,

salt, assyrian, rule, of, susa, began, in, 647, bc, and, lasted, till, median, capture, of, susa, in, 617, bc, susa, underwent, a, major, political, and, ethnocultural, transition, when, it, became, part, of, the, persian, achaemenid, empire, between, 540, and, 539, bc, when, it, was, captured, by, cyrus, the, great, during, his, conquest, of, elam, susiana, of, which, susa, was, the, capital, the, nabonidus, chronicle, records, that, prior, to, the, battle, s, nabonidus, had, ordered, cult, statues, from, outlying, babylonian, cities, to, be, brought, into, the, capital, suggesting, that, the, conflict, over, susa, had, begun, possibly, in, the, winter, of, 540, bc, it, is, probable, that, cyrus, negotiated, with, the, babylonian, generals, to, obtain, a, compromise, on, their, part, and, therefore, avoid, an, armed, confrontation, nabonidus, was, staying, in, the, city, at, the, time, and, soon, fled, to, the, capital, babylon, which, he, had, not, visited, in, years, cyrus, conquest, of, susa, and, the, rest, of, babylonia, commenced, a, fundamental, shift, bringing, susa, under, persian, control, for, the, first, time, strabo, stated, that, cyrus, made, susa, an, imperial, capital, though, there, was, no, new, construction, in, that, period, so, this, is, in, dispute, under, cyrus, son, cambyses, ii, susa, became, a, center, of, political, power, as, one, of, four, capitals, of, the, achaemenid, persian, empire, while, reducing, the, significance, of, pasargadae, as, the, capital, of, persis, following, cambyses, brief, rule, darius, the, great, began, a, major, building, program, in, susa, and, persepolis, which, included, building, a, large, palace, during, this, time, he, describes, his, new, capital, in, an, inscription, this, palace, which, i, built, at, susa, from, afar, its, ornamentation, was, brought, downward, the, earth, was, dug, until, i, reached, rock, in, the, earth, when, the, excavation, had, been, made, then, rubble, was, packed, down, some, 40, cubits, in, depth, another, part, 20, cubits, in, depth, on, that, rubble, the, palace, was, constructed, the, city, forms, the, setting, of, the, persians, 472, bc, an,

are, said, to, have, occurred, in, susa, during, the, achaemenid, period, the, king, ahasuerus, mentioned, in, that, book, may, refer, to, xerxes, i, 486, 465, bc, susa, lost, much, of, its, importance, after, the, invasion, of, alexander, the, great, of, macedon, in, 331, bc, in, 324, bc, he, met, nearchus, here, who, explored, the, persian, gulf, as, he, returned, from, the, indus, river, by, sea, in, that, same, year, alexander, celebrated, in, susa, with, a, mass, wedding, between, the, persians, and, macedonians, the, city, retained, its, importance, under, the, seleucids, for, approximately, one, century, after, alexander, however, susa, lost, its, position, of, imperial, capital, to, seleucia, on, the, tigris, to, become, the, regional, capital, of, the, satrapy, of, susiana, nevertheless, susa, retained, its, economic, importance, to, the, empire, with, its, vast, assortment, of, merchants, conducting, trade, in, susa, using, charax, spasinou, as, its, port, the, city, was, named, seleucia, on, the, eulaeus, or, seleucia, ad, eulaeum, seleucus, i, nicator, minted, coins, there, in, substantial, quantities, susa, is, rich, in, greek, inscriptions, perhaps,

the, adjacent, elymais, broke, free, from, the, seleucid, empire, the, city, was, at, least, temporarily, ruled, by, the, rulers, of, the, elymais, with, kamnaskires, ii, nikephoros, minting, coins, there, the, city, may, again, have, briefly, returned, to, seleucid, rule, but, starting, with, phraates, ii, about, 138, 127, bc, to, gotarzes, ii, about, 40, 51, ad, almost, all, rulers, of, the, parthian, empire, coined, coins, in, the, city, indicating, that, it, was, firmly, in, the, hands, of, the, parthians, at, least, during, this, period, the, city, however, retained, a, considerable, amount, of, independence, and, retained, its, greek, city, state, organization, well, into, the, ensuing, parthian, period, from, second, half, of, the, first, century, it, was, probably, partly, governed, by, rulers, of, elymais, again, but, it, became, parthian, once, again, in, 215, susa, was, a, frequent, place, of, refuge, for, parthian, and, later, the, persian, sassanid, kings, as, the, romans, sacked, ctesiphon, five, different, times, between, 116, and, 297, ad, susa, was, briefly, captured, in, 116, ad, by, the, roman, emperor, trajan, during, the, course, of, his, parthian, campaign, never, again, would, the, roman, empire, advance, so, far, to, the, east, suzan, was, conquered, and, destroyed, in, 224, ad, by, the, sassanid, ardashir, i, but, rebuilt, immediately, thereafter, and, perhaps, even, temporarily, a, royal, residence, according, to, a, later, tradition, shapur, i, is, said, to, have, spent, his, twilight, years, in, the, city, although, this, tradition, is, uncertain, and, perhaps, refers, more, to, shapur, ii, under, the, sassanids, following, the, founding, of, gundeshapur, susa, slowly, lost, its, importance, archaeologically, the, sassanid, city, is, less, dense, compared, to, the, parthian, period, but, there, were, still, significant, buildings, with, the, settlement, extending, over, 400, hectares, susa, was, also, still, very, significant, economically, and, a, trading, center, especially, in, gold, trading, coins, also, continued, to, be, minted, in, the, city, the, city, had, a, christian, community, in, a, separate, district, with, a, nestorian, bishop, whose, last, representative, is, attested, to, in, 1265, archaeologically, a, stucco, panel, with, the, image, of, a, christian, saint, has, been,
