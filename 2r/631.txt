knossos, pronounced, k, n, s, o, s, s, s, ancient, greek, romanized, kn, ss, s, pronounced, linear, b, ko, no, so, is, a, bronze, age, archaeological, site, in, crete, the, site, was, a, major, center, of, the, minoan, civilization, and, is, known, for, its, association, with, the, greek, myth, of, theseus, and, the, minotaur, it, is, located, on, the, outskirts, of, heraklion, and, remains, a, popular, tourist, destination, knossos, is, considered, by, many, to, be, the, oldest, city, in, europe, knossos, is, dominated, by, the, monumental, palace, of, minos, like, other, minoan, palaces, this, building, served, as, a, combination, religious, and, administrative, center, rather, than, a, royal, residence, the, earliest, parts, of, the, palace, were, built, around, 1900, bc, in, an, area, that, had, been, used, for, ritual, feasting, since, the, neolithic, the, palace, was, continually, renovated, and, expanded, over, the, next, five, centuries, until, its, final, destruction, around, 1350, bc, the, site, was, first, excavated, by, minos, kalokairinos, in, 1877, in, 1900, arthur, evans, undertook, more, extensive, excavations, which, unearthed, most, of, the, palace, as, well, as, many, now, famous, artifacts, including, the, bull, leaping, fresco, the, snake, goddess, figurines, and, numerous, linear, b, tablets, while, evans, is, often, credited, for, discovering, the, minoan, civilization, his, work, is, controversial, in, particular, for, his, inaccurate, and, irreversible, reconstructions, of, architectural, remains, at, the, site, knossos, was, settled, around, 7000, bc, during, the, pre, pottery, neolithic, making, it, the, oldest, known, settlement, in, crete, the, initial, settlement, was, a, hamlet, of, 25, 50, people, who, lived, in, wattle, and, daub, huts, kept, animals, grew, crops, and, in, the, event, of, tragedy, buried, their, children, under, the, floor, remains, from, this, period, are, concentrated, in, the, area, which, would, later, become, the, central, court, of, the, palace, suggesting, continuity, in, ritual, activity, in, the, early, neolithic, 6000, 5000, bc, a, village, of, 200, 600, persons, occupied, most, of, the, area, of, the, later, palace, and, the, slopes, to, the, north, and, west, residents, lived, in, one, or, two, room, square, houses, of, mud, brick, walls, set, on, socles, of, stone, either, field, stone, or, recycled, stone, artifacts, the, inner, walls, were, lined, with, mud, plaster, the, roofs, were, flat, composed, of, mud, over, branches, the, residents, dug, hearths, at, various, locations, in, the, center, of, the, main, room, this, village, had, an, unusual, feature, one, house, under, the, west, court, contained, eight, rooms, and, covered, 50, m, 2, 540, sq, ft, the, walls, were, at, right, angles, the, door, was, centered, large, stones, were, used, for, support, under, points, of, greater, stress, the, fact, that, distinct, sleeping, cubicles, for, individuals, was, not, the, custom, suggests, storage, units, of, some, sort, the, settlement, of, the, middle, neolithic, 5000, 4000, bc, housed, 500, 1000, people, in, more, substantial, and, presumably, more, family, private, homes, construction, was, the, same, except, the, windows, and, doors, were, timbered, a, fixed, raised, hearth, occupied, the, center, of, the, main, room, and, pilasters, and, other, raised, features, cabinets, beds, occupied, the, perimeter, under, the, palace, was, the, great, house, a, 100, m, 2, 1, 100, sq, ft, area, stone, house, divided, into, five, rooms, with, meter, thick, walls, suggesting, a, second, story, was, present, the, presence, of, the, house, which, is, unlikely, to, have, been, a, private, residence, like, the, others, suggests, a, communal, or, public, use, i, e, it, may, have, been, the, predecessor, of, a, palace, in, the, late, or, final, neolithic, two, different, but, overlapping, classification, systems, around, 4000, 3000, bc, the, population, increased, dramatically, it, is, believed, that, the, first, cretan, palaces, were, built, soon, after, c, 2000, bc, in, the, early, part, of, the, middle, minoan, period, at, knossos, and, other, sites, including, malia, phaestos, and, zakro, these, palaces, which, were, to, set, the, pattern, of, organisation, in, crete, and, greece, through, the, second, millennium, were, a, sharp, break, from, the, neolithic, village, system, that, had, prevailed, thus, far, the, building, of, the, palaces, implies, greater, wealth, and, a, concentration, of, authority, both, political, and, religious, it, is, suggested, that, they, followed, eastern, models, such, as, those, at, ugarit, on, the, syrian, coast, and, mari, on, the, upper, euphrates, the, early, palaces, were, destroyed, during, middle, minoan, ii, sometime, before, c, 1700, almost, certainly, by, earthquakes, to, which, crete, is, prone, by, c, 1650, they, had, been, rebuilt, on, a, grander, scale, and, the, period, of, the, second, palaces, c, 1650, c, 1450, marks, the, height, of, minoan, prosperity, all, the, palaces, had, large, central, courtyards, which, may, have, been, used, for, public, ceremonies, and, spectacles, living, quarters, storage, rooms, and, administrative, centres, were, positioned, around, the, court, and, there, were, also, working, quarters, for, skilled, craftsmen, the, palace, of, knossos, was, by, far, the, largest, covering, three, acres, with, its, main, building, alone, and, five, acres, when, separate, out, buildings, are, considered, it, had, a, monumental, staircase, leading, to, state, rooms, on, an, upper, floor, a, ritual, cult, centre, was, on, the, ground, floor, the, palace, stores, occupied, sixteen, rooms, the, main, feature, in, these, being, the, pithoi, that, were, large, storage, jars, up, to, five, feet, tall, they, were, mainly, used, for, storage, of, oil, wool, wine, and, grain, smaller, and, more, valuable, objects, were, stored, in, lead, lined, cists, the, palace, had, bathrooms, toilets, and, a, drainage, system, a, theatre, was, found, at, knossos, that, would, have, held, 400, spectators, an, earlier, one, has, been, found, at, phaestos, the, orchestral, area, was, rectangular, unlike, later, athenian, models, and, they, were, probably, used, for, religious, dances, building, techniques, at, knossos, were, typical, the, foundations, and, lower, course, were, stonework, with, the, whole, built, on, a, timber, framework, of, beams, and, pillars, the, main, structure, was, built, of, large, unbaked, bricks, the, roof, was, flat, with, a, thick, layer, of, clay, over, brushwood, internal, rooms, were, brightened, by, light, wells, and, columns, of, wood, many, fluted, were, used, to, lend, both, support, and, dignity, the, chambers, and, corridors, were, decorated, with, frescoes, showing, scenes, from, everyday, life, and, scenes, of, processions, warfare, is, conspicuously, absent, the, fashions, of, the, time, may, be, seen, in, depictions, of, women, in, various, poses, they, had, elaborately, dressed, hair, and, wore, long, dresses, with, flounced, skirts, and, puffed, sleeves, their, bodices, were, tightly, drawn, in, round, their, waists, and, their, breasts, were, exposed, the, prosperity, of, knossos, was, primarily, based, upon, the, development, of, native, cretan, resources, such, as, oil, wine, and, wool, another, factor, was, the, expansion, of, trade, evidenced, by, minoan, pottery, found, in, egypt, syria, anatolia, rhodes, the, cyclades, sicily, and, mainland, greece, there, seem, to, have, been, strong, minoan, connections, with, rhodes, miletus, and, samos, cretan, influence, may, be, seen, in, the, earliest, scripts, found, in, cyprus, the, main, market, for, cretan, wares, was, the, cyclades, where, there, was, a, demand, for, pottery, especially, the, stone, vases, it, is, not, known, whether, the, islands, were, subject, to, crete, or, just, trading, partners, but, there, certainly, was, strong, cretan, influence, around, 1450, bc, the, palaces, at, malia, phaestos, and, zakros, were, destroyed, leaving, knossos, as, the, sole, surviving, palace, on, crete, in, this, final, period, knossos, seems, to, have, been, influenced, or, perhaps, ruled, by, people, from, the, mainland, greek, became, the, administrative, language, and, the, material, culture, shows, parallels, with, mycenaean, styles, for, instance, in, the, architecture, of, tombs, and, styles, of, pottery, around, 1350, bc, the, palace, was, destroyed, and, not, rebuilt, the, building, was, ravaged, by, a, fire, which, triggered, the, collapse, of, the, upper, stories, it, is, not, known, whether, this, final, destruction, was, intentional, or, the, result, of, a, natural, disaster, such, as, an, earthquake, while, parts, of, the, palace, may, have, been, used, for, later, ceremonies, and, the, town, of, knossos, saw, a, resurgence, around, 1200, bc, the, building, and, its, associated, institutions, were, never, restored, after, the, bronze, age, the, town, of, knossos, continued, to, be, occupied, by, 1000, bc, it, had, reemerged, as, one, of, the, most, important, centers, of, crete, the, city, had, two, ports, one, at, amnisos, and, another, at, heraklion, according, to, the, ancient, geographer, strabo, the, knossians, colonized, the, city, of, brundisium, in, italy, in, 343, bc, knossos, was, allied, with, philip, ii, of, macedon, the, city, employed, a, phocian, mercenary, named, phalaikos, against, their, enemy, the, city, of, lyttus, the, lyttians, appealed, to, the, spartans, who, sent, their, king, archidamus, iii, against, the, knossians, in, hellenistic, times, knossos, came, under, egyptian, influence, but, despite, considerable, military, efforts, during, the, chremonidean, war, 267, 261, bc, the, ptolemies, were, not, able, to, unify, the, warring, city, states, in, the, third, century, bc, knossos, expanded, its, power, to, dominate, almost, the, entire, island, but, during, the, lyttian, war, in, 220, bc, it, was, checked, by, a, coalition, led, by, the, polyrrhenians, and, the, macedonian, king, philip, v, twenty, years, later, during, the, cretan, war, 205, 200, bc, the, knossians, were, once, more, among, philip, s, opponents, and, through, roman, and, rhodian, aid, this, time, they, managed, to, liberate, crete, from, the, macedonian, influence, with, roman, aid, knossos, became, once, more, the, first, city, of, crete, but, in, 67, bc, the, roman, senate, chose, gortys, as, the, capital, of, the, newly, created, province, creta, et, cyrene, in, 36, bc, knossos, became, a, roman, colony, named, colonia, iulia, nobilis, the, colony, which, was, built, using, roman, style, architecture, was, situated, within, the, vicinity, of, the, palace, but, only, a, small, part, of, it, has, been, excavated, the, identification, of, knossos, with, the, bronze, age, site, is, supported, by, the, roman, coins, that, were, scattered, over, the, fields, surrounding, the, pre, excavation, site, then, a, large, mound, named, kephala, hill, elevation, 85, m, 279, ft, from, current, sea, level, many, of, them, were, inscribed, with, knosion, or, knos, on, the, obverse, and, an, image, of, a, minotaur, or, labyrinth, on, the, reverse, the, coins, came, from, the, roman, settlement, of, colonia, julia, nobilis, cnossus, a, roman, colony, placed, just, to, the, north, of, and, politically, including, kephala, the, romans, believed, they, were, the, first, to, colonize, knossos, in, 325, knossos, became, a, diocese, suffragan, of, the, metropolitan, see, of, gortyna, in, ottoman, crete, the, see, of, knossos, was, in, agios, myron, 14, km, to, the, southwest, the, bishops, of, gortyn, continued, to, call, themselves, bishops, of, knossos, until, the, nineteenth, century, the, diocese, was, abolished, in, 1831, during, the, ninth, century, ad, the, local, population, shifted, to, the, new, town, of, chandax, modern, heraklion, by, the, thirteenth, century, it, was, called, the, makruteikhos, long, wall, in, its, modern, history, the, name, knossos, is, used, only, for, the, archaeological, site, it, was, extensively, excavated, by, arthur, evans, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, evans, residence, at, the, site, served, as, a, military, headquarters, during, world, war, ii, knossos, is, now, situated, in, the, expanding, suburbs, of, heraklion, in, greek, mythology, king, minos, dwelt, in, a, palace, at, knossos, he, had, daedalus, construct, a, labyrinth, a, very, large, maze, in, which, to, retain, his, son, the, minotaur, daedalus, also, built, a, dancing, floor, for, queen, ariadne, the, name, knossos, was, subsequently, adopted, by, arthur, evans, as, far, as, is, currently, known, it, was, william, stillman, the, american, consul, who, published, kalokairinos, discoveries, who, seeing, the, sign, of, the, double, axe, labrys, on, the, massive, walls, partly, uncovered, by, kalokairinos, first, associated, the, complex, with, the, labyrinth, of, legend, calling, the, ruins, labyrinthine, evans, agreed, with, stillman, the, myth, of, the, minotaur, tells, that, theseus, a, prince, from, athens, whose, father, was, an, ancient, greek, king, named, aegeus, the, basis, for, the, name, of, the, greek, sea, the, aegean, sea, sailed, to, crete, where, he, was, forced, to, fight, a, terrible, creature, called, the, minotaur, the, minotaur, was, a, half, man, half, bull, and, was, kept, in, the, labyrinth, a, building, like, a, maze, by, king, minos, the, ruler, of, crete, the, king, s, daughter, ariadne, fell, in, love, with, theseus, before, he, entered, the, labyrinth, to, fight, the, minotaur, ariadne, gave, him, a, ball, of, thread, which, he, unwound, as, he, went, into, the, labyrinth, so, that, he, could, find, his, way, back, by, following, it, theseus, killed, the, minotaur, and, then, he, and, ariadne, fled, from, crete, escaping, her, angry, father, as, it, turns, out, there, probably, was, an, association, of, the, word, labyrinth, whatever, its, etymology, with, ancient, crete, the, sign, of, the, double, axe, was, used, throughout, the, mycenaean, world, as, an, apotropaic, mark, its, presence, on, an, object, would, prevent, it, from, being, killed, axes, were, scratched, on, many, of, the, stones, of, the, palace, it, appears, in, pottery, decoration, and, is, a, motif, of, the, shrine, of, the, double, axes, at, the, palace, as, well, as, of, many, shrines, throughout, crete, and, the, aegean, and, finally, it, appears, in, linear, b, on, knossos, tablet, gg702, as, da, pu, 2, ri, to, jo, po, ti, ni, ja, which, probably, represents, the, mycenaean, greek, daburinthoio, potniai, to, the, mistress, of, the, labyrinth, recording, the, distribution, of, one, jar, of, honey, a, credible, theory, uniting, all, the, evidence, has, yet, to, be, formulated, knossos, appears, in, other, later, legends, and, literature, herodotus, wrote, that, minos, the, legendary, king, of, knossos, established, a, thalassocracy, sea, empire, thucydides, accepted, the, tradition, and, added, that, minos, cleared, the, sea, of, pirates, increased, the, flow, of, trade, and, colonised, many, aegean, islands, other, literature, describes, rhadamanthus, as, the, mythological, lawgiver, of, crete, cleinias, of, crete, attributes, to, him, the, tradition, of, cretan, gymnasia, and, common, meals, in, book, i, of, plato, s, laws, and, describes, the, logic, of, the, custom, as, enabling, a, constant, state, of, war, readiness, the, site, of, knossos, was, identified, by, minos, kalokairinos, who, excavated, parts, of, the, west, wing, in, the, winter, of, 1878, 1879, the, british, archaeologist, sir, arthur, evans, 1851, 1941, and, his, team, began, long, term, evacuations, from, 1900, to, 1913, and, from, 1922, to, 1930, its, size, far, exceeded, his, original, expectations, as, did, the, discovery, of, two, ancient, scripts, which, he, termed, linear, a, and, linear, b, to, distinguish, their, writing, from, the, pictographs, also, present, from, the, layering, of, the, palace, evans, developed, an, archaeological, concept, of, the, civilization, that, used, it, which, he, called, minoan, following, the, pre, existing, custom, of, labelling, all, objects, from, the, location, minoan, since, their, discovery, the, ruins, have, been, the, centre, of, excavation, tourism, and, occupation, as, a, headquarters, by, governments, warring, over, the, control, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, in, two, world, wars, john, davies, evans, no, relation, to, arthur, evans, undertook, further, excavations, in, pits, and, trenches, over, the, palace, focusing, on, the, neolithic, the, palace, at, knossos, was, continuously, renovated, and, modified, throughout, its, existence, the, currently, visible, palace, is, an, accumulation, of, features, from, various, periods, alongside, modern, reconstructions, which, are, often, inaccurate, thus, the, palace, was, never, exactly, as, it, appears, today, like, other, minoan, palaces, knossos, was, arranged, around, a, rectangular, central, court, this, court, was, twice, as, long, north, south, as, it, was, east, west, an, orientation, that, would, have, maximized, sunlight, and, positioned, important, rooms, towards, the, rising, sun, the, central, court, is, believed, to, have, been, used, for, rituals, and, festivals, one, of, these, festivals, is, believed, to, be, depicted, in, the, grandstand, fresco, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, bull, leaping, would, have, taken, place, in, the, courts, though, others, have, argued, that, the, paving, would, not, have, been, optimal, for, the, animals, or, the, people, and, that, the, restricted, access, points, would, have, kept, the, spectacle, too, far, out, of, public, view, the, 6, acres, 24, 000, m, 2, of, the, palace, included, a, theater, a, main, entrance, on, each, of, its, four, cardinal, faces, and, extensive, storerooms, the, palace, was, built, on, kephala, hill, 5, km, 3, 1, mi, south, of, the, coast, the, site, is, located, at, the, confluence, of, two, streams, called, the, vlychia, and, the, kairatos, which, would, have, provided, drinking, water, to, the, ancient, inhabitants, looming, over, the, right, bank, of, the, vlychia, on, the, opposite, shore, from, knossos, is, gypsades, hill, on, whose, eastern, side, the, minoans, quarried, their, gypsum, though, it, was, surrounded, by, the, town, of, knossos, this, hill, was, never, an, acropolis, in, the, greek, sense, it, had, no, steep, heights, remained, unfortified, and, was, not, very, high, off, the, surrounding, ground, the, royal, road, is, the, last, vestige, of, a, minoan, road, that, connected, the, port, to, the, palace, complex, today, a, modern, road, leoforos, knosou, built, over, or, replacing, the, ancient, roadway, serves, that, function, and, continues, south, the, palace, had, extensive, storage, magazines, which, were, used, for, agricultural, commodities, as, well, as, tableware, enormous, sets, of, high, quality, tableware, were, stored, in, the, palaces, often, produced, elsewhere, in, crete, pottery, at, knossos, is, prolific, heavily, decorated, and, uniquely, styled, by, period, in, minoan, chronology, the, standard, relative, chronology, is, largely, based, on, pottery, styles, and, is, thus, used, to, assign, dates, to, layers, of, the, palace, the, palace, had, at, least, three, separate, water, management, systems, one, for, supply, one, for, drainage, of, runoff, and, one, for, drainage, of, waste, water, aqueducts, brought, fresh, water, to, kephala, hill, from, springs, at, archanes, about, 10, km, away, springs, there, are, the, source, of, the, kairatos, river, in, the, valley, in, which, kephala, is, located, the, aqueduct, branched, to, the, palace, and, to, the, town, water, was, distributed, at, the, palace, by, gravity, feed, through, terracotta, pipes, to, fountains, and, spigots, the, pipes, were, tapered, at, one, end, to, make, a, pressure, fit, with, rope, for, sealing, unlike, mycenae, no, hidden, springs, have, been, discovered, sanitation, drainage, was, through, a, closed, system, leading, to, a, sewer, apart, from, the, hill, the, queen, s, megaron, contained, an, example, of, the, first, known, water, flushing, system, latrine, adjoining, the, bathroom, this, toilet, was, a, seat, over, a, drain, that, was, flushed, by, pouring, water, from, a, jug, the, bathtub, located, in, the, adjoining, bathroom, similarly, had, to, be, filled, by, someone, heating, carrying, and, pouring, water, and, must, have, been, drained, by, overturning, into, a, floor, drain, or, by, bailing, this, toilet, and, bathtub, were, exceptional, structures, within, the, 1, 300, room, complex, as, the, hill, was, periodically, drenched, by, torrential, rains, a, runoff, system, was, a, necessity, it, began, with, channels, in, the, flat, surfaces, which, were, zigzag, and, contained, catchment, basins, to, control, the, water, velocity, probably, the, upper, system, was, open, manholes, provided, access, to, parts, that, were, covered, some, links, to, photographs, of, parts, of, the, water, collection, management, system, follow, due, to, its, placement, on, the, hill, the, palace, received, sea, breezes, during, the, summer, it, had, porticoes, and, air, shafts, the, palace, also, includes, the, minoan, column, a, structure, notably, different, from, greek, columns, unlike, the, stone, columns, that, are, characteristic, of, greek, architecture, the, minoan, column, was, constructed, from, the, trunk, of, a, cypress, tree, which, is, common, to, the, mediterranean, while, greek, columns, are, smaller, at, the, top, and, wider, at, the, bottom, to, create, the, illusion, of, greater, height, entasis, the, minoan, columns, are, smaller, at, the, bottom, and, wider, at, the, top, a, result, of, inverting, the, cypress, trunk, to, prevent, sprouting, once, in, place, the, columns, at, the, palace, of, minos, were, plastered, painted, red, and, mounted, on, stone, bases, with, round, pillow, like, capitals, the, palace, at, knossos, was, a, place, of, high, color, as, were, greek, buildings, in, the, classical, period, and, as, are, greek, buildings, today, in, the, em, period, the, walls, and, pavements, were, coated, with, a, pale, red, derived, from, red, ochre, in, addition, to, the, background, coloring, the, walls, displayed, fresco, panel, murals, entirely, of, red, in, the, subsequent, mm, period, with, the, development, of, the, art, white, and, black, were, added, and, then, blue, green, and, yellow, the, pigments, were, derived, from, natural, materials, such, as, ground, hematite, outdoor, panels, were, painted, on, fresh, stucco, with, the, motif, in, relief, indoor, on, fresh, pure, plaster, softer, than, the, plaster, with, additives, ordinarily, used, on, walls, the, decorative, motifs, were, generally, bordered, scenes, humans, legendary, creatures, animals, rocks, vegetation, and, marine, life, the, earliest, imitated, pottery, motifs, most, have, been, reconstructed, from, various, numbers, of, flakes, fallen, to, the, floor, evans, had, various, technicians, and, artists, work, on, the, project, some, artists, some, chemists, and, restorers, the, symmetry, and, use, of, templates, made, possible, a, degree, of, reconstruction, beyond, what, was, warranted, by, only, the, flakes, for, example, if, evidence, of, the, use, of, a, certain, template, existed, scantily, in, one, place, the, motif, could, be, supplied, from, the, template, found, somewhere, else, like, the, contemporary, murals, in, the, funerary, art, of, the, egyptians, certain, conventions, were, used, that, also, assisted, prediction, for, example, male, figures, are, shown, with, darker, or, redder, skin, than, female, figures, some, archaeological, authors, have, objected, that, evans, and, his, restorers, were, not, discovering, the, palace, and, civilization, as, it, was, but, were, creating, a, modern, artifact, based, on, contemporary, art, and, architecture, the, centerpiece, of, the, minoan, palace, was, the, so, called, throne, room, or, little, throne, room, dated, to, lm, ii, this, chamber, has, an, alabaster, seat, which, evans, referred, to, as, a, throne, built, into, the, north, wall, on, three, sides, of, the, room, are, gypsum, benches, on, the, south, side, of, the, throne, room, there, is, a, feature, called, a, lustral, basin, so, called, because, evans, found, remains, of, unguent, flasks, inside, it,
