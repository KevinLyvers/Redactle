uzbekistan, from, at, least, the, 15th, century, bc, in, the, avesta, namely, in, the, mihr, yasht, and, the, vendidad, the, toponym, of, gava, gava, g, um, is, mentioned, as, the, land, of, the, sogdians, gava, is, therefore, interpreted, as, referring, to, sogdia, during, the, time, of, the, avesta, although, there, is, no, universal, consensus, on, the, chronology, of, the, avesta, most, scholars, today, argue, for, an, early, chronology, which, would, place, the, composition, of, young, avestan, texts, like, the, mihr, yasht, and, the, vendiad, in, the, first, half, of, the, first, millennium, bce, the, first, mention, of, gava, is, found, in, the, mihr, yasht, ie, the, hymn, dedicated, to, the, zoroastrian, deity, mithra, in, verse, 10, 14, it, is, described, how, mithra, reaches, mount, hara, and, looks, at, the, entirety, of, the, airyoshayan, airiio, shaiianem, lands, of, the, arya, where, navigable, rivers, rush, with, wide, a, swell, towards, parutian, ishkata, haraivian, margu, gava, sogdia, gaom, ca, su, m, and, chorasmia, the, second, mention, is, found, in, the, first, chapter, of, the, vendidad, which, consists, of, a, list, of, the, sixteen, good, regions, created, by, ahura, mazda, for, the, iranians, gava, is, the, second, region, mentioned, on, the, list, directly, behind, airyanem, vaejah, the, homeland, of, zarathustra, and, the, iranians, according, to, zoroastrian, tradition, the, second, of, the, good, lands, and, countries, which, i, ahura, mazda, created, was, the, gava, of, the, sogdians, g, um, yim, su, shaiian, m, thereupon, came, angra, mainyu, who, is, all, death, and, he, counter, created, the, locust, which, brings, death, unto, cattle, and, plants, while, it, is, widely, accepted, that, gava, referred, to, the, region, inhabited, by, the, sogdians, during, the, avestan, period, its, meaning, is, not, clear, for, example, vogelsang, connects, it, with, gabae, a, sogdian, stronghold, in, western, sogdia, and, speculates, that, during, the, time, of, the, avesta, the, center, of, sogdia, may, have, been, closer, to, bukhara, instead, of, samarkand, achaemenid, ruler, cyrus, the, great, conquered, sogdiana, while, campaigning, in, central, asia, in, 546, 539, bc, a, fact, mentioned, by, the, ancient, greek, historian, herodotus, in, his, histories, darius, i, introduced, the, aramaic, writing, system, and, coin, currency, to, central, asia, in, addition, to, incorporating, sogdians, into, his, standing, army, as, regular, soldiers, and, cavalrymen, sogdia, was, also, listed, on, the, behistun, inscription, of, darius, a, contingent, of, sogdian, soldiers, fought, in, the, main, army, of, xerxes, i, during, his, second, ultimately, failed, invasion, of, greece, in, 480, bc, a, persian, inscription, from, susa, claims, that, the, palace, there, was, adorned, with, lapis, lazuli, and, carnelian, originating, from, sogdiana, during, this, period, of, persian, rule, the, western, half, of, asia, minor, was, part, of, the, greek, civilization, as, the, achaemenids, conquered, it, they, met, persistent, resistance, and, revolt, one, of, their, solutions, was, to, ethnically, cleanse, rebelling, regions, relocating, those, who, survived, to, the, far, side, of, the, empire, thus, sogdiana, came, to, have, a, significant, greek, population, given, the, absence, of, any, named, satraps, i, e, achaemenid, provincial, governors, for, sogdiana, in, historical, records, modern, scholarship, has, concluded, that, sogdiana, was, governed, from, the, satrapy, of, nearby, bactria, the, satraps, were, often, relatives, of, the, ruling, persian, kings, especially, sons, who, were, not, designated, as, the, heir, apparent, sogdiana, likely, remained, under, persian, control, until, roughly, 400, bc, during, the, reign, of, artaxerxes, ii, rebellious, states, of, the, persian, empire, took, advantage, of, the, weak, artaxerxes, ii, and, some, such, as, egypt, were, able, to, regain, their, independence, persia, s, massive, loss, of, central, asian, territory, is, widely, attributed, to, the, ruler, s, lack, of, control, however, unlike, egypt, which, was, quickly, recaptured, by, the, persian, empire, sogdiana, remained, independent, until, it, was, conquered, by, alexander, the, great, when, the, latter, invaded, the, persian, empire, pharasmanes, an, already, independent, king, of, khwarezm, allied, with, the, macedonians, and, sent, troops, to, alexander, in, 329, bc, for, his, war, against, the, scythians, of, the, black, sea, region, even, though, this, anticipated, campaign, never, materialized, during, the, achaemenid, period, 550, 330, bc, the, sogdians, lived, as, a, nomadic, people, much, like, the, neighboring, yuezhi, who, spoke, bactrian, an, indo, iranian, language, closely, related, to, sogdian, and, were, already, engaging, in, overland, trade, some, of, them, had, also, gradually, settled, the, land, to, engage, in, agriculture, similar, to, how, the, yuezhi, offered, tributary, gifts, of, jade, to, the, emperors, of, china, the, sogdians, are, recorded, in, persian, records, as, submitting, precious, gifts, of, lapis, lazuli, and, carnelian, to, darius, i, the, persian, king, of, kings, although, the, sogdians, were, at, times, independent, and, living, outside, the, boundaries, of, large, empires, they, never, formed, a, great, empire, of, their, own, like, the, yuezhi, who, established, the, kushan, empire, 30, 375, ad, of, central, and, south, asia, a, now, independent, and, warlike, sogdiana, formed, a, border, region, insulating, the, achaemenid, persians, from, the, nomadic, scythians, to, the, north, and, east, it, was, led, at, first, by, bessus, the, achaemenid, satrap, of, bactria, after, assassinating, darius, iii, in, his, flight, from, the, macedonian, greek, army, he, became, claimant, to, the, achaemenid, throne, the, sogdian, rock, or, rock, of, ariamazes, a, fortress, in, sogdiana, was, captured, in, 327, bc, by, the, forces, of, alexander, the, great, the, basileus, of, macedonian, greece, and, conqueror, of, the, persian, achaemenid, empire, oxyartes, a, sogdian, nobleman, of, bactria, had, hoped, to, keep, his, daughter, roxana, safe, at, the, fortress, of, the, sogdian, rock, yet, after, its, fall, roxana, was, soon, wed, to, alexander, as, one, of, his, several, wives, roxana, a, sogdian, whose, name, roshanak, means, little, star, was, the, mother, of, alexander, iv, of, macedon, who, inherited, his, late, father, s, throne, in, 323, bc, although, the, empire, was, soon, divided, in, the, wars, of, the, diadochi, after, an, extended, campaign, putting, down, sogdian, resistance, and, founding, military, outposts, manned, by, his, macedonian, veterans, alexander, united, sogdiana, with, bactria, into, one, satrapy, the, sogdian, nobleman, and, warlord, spitamenes, 370, 328, bc, allied, with, scythian, tribes, led, an, uprising, against, alexander, s, forces, this, revolt, was, put, down, by, alexander, and, his, generals, amyntas, craterus, and, coenus, with, the, aid, of, native, bactrian, and, sogdian, troops, with, the, scythian, and, sogdian, rebels, defeated, spitamenes, was, allegedly, betrayed, by, his, own, wife, and, beheaded, pursuant, with, his, own, marriage, to, roxana, alexander, encouraged, his, men, to, marry, sogdian, women, in, order, to, discourage, further, revolt, this, included, apama, daughter, of, the, rebel, spitamenes, who, wed, seleucus, i, nicator, and, bore, him, a, son, and, future, heir, to, the, seleucid, throne, according, to, the, roman, historian, appian, seleucus, i, named, three, new, hellenistic, cities, in, asia, after, her, see, apamea, the, military, power, of, the, sogdians, never, recovered, subsequently, sogdiana, formed, part, of, the, hellenistic, greco, bactrian, kingdom, a, breakaway, state, from, the, seleucid, empire, founded, in, 248, bc, by, diodotus, i, for, roughly, a, century, euthydemus, i, a, former, satrap, of, sogdiana, seems, to, have, held, the, sogdian, territory, as, a, rival, claimant, to, the, greco, bactrian, throne, his, coins, were, later, copied, locally, and, bore, aramaic, inscriptions, the, greco, bactrian, king, eucratides, i, may, have, recovered, sovereignty, of, sogdia, temporarily, finally, sogdia, was, occupied, by, nomads, when, the, sakas, overran, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, around, 145, bc, soon, followed, by, the, yuezhi, the, nomadic, predecessors, of, the, kushans, from, then, until, about, 40, bc, the, yuezhi, tepidly, minted, coins, imitating, and, still, bearing, the, images, of, the, greco, bactrian, kings, eucratides, i, and, heliocles, i, the, yuezhis, were, visited, in, transoxiana, by, a, chinese, mission, led, by, zhang, qian, in, 126, bc, which, sought, an, offensive, alliance, with, the, yuezhi, against, the, xiongnu, zhang, qian, who, spent, a, year, in, transoxiana, and, bactria, wrote, a, detailed, account, in, the, shiji, which, gives, considerable, insight, into, the, situation, in, central, asia, at, the, time, the, request, for, an, alliance, was, denied, by, the, son, of, the, slain, yuezhi, king, who, preferred, to, maintain, peace, in, transoxiana, rather, than, seek, revenge, zhang, qian, also, reported, the, great, yuezhi, live, 2, 000, or, 3, 000, li, west, of, dayuan, north, of, the, gui, river, they, are, bordered, on, the, south, by, daxia, on, the, west, by, anxi, and, on, the, north, by, kangju, they, are, a, nation, of, nomads, moving, from, place, to, place, with, their, herds, and, their, customs, are, like, those, of, the, xiongnu, they, have, some, 100, 000, or, 200, 000, archer, warriors, from, the, 1st, century, ad, the, yuezhi, morphed, into, the, powerful, kushan, empire, covering, an, area, from, sogdia, to, eastern, india, the, kushan, empire, became, the, center, of, the, profitable, central, asian, commerce, they, began, minting, unique, coins, bearing, the, faces, of, their, own, rulers, they, are, related, to, have, collaborated, militarily, with, the, chinese, against, nomadic, incursion, particularly, when, they, allied, with, the, han, dynasty, general, ban, chao, against, the, sogdians, in, 84, when, the, latter, were, trying, to, support, a, revolt, by, the, king, of, kashgar, historical, knowledge, about, sogdia, is, somewhat, hazy, during, the, period, of, the, parthian, empire, 247, bc, 224, ad, in, persia, the, subsequent, sasanian, empire, of, persia, conquered, and, incorporated, sogdia, as, a, satrapy, in, 260, an, inscription, dating, to, the, reign, of, shapur, i, claiming, sogdia, to, the, mountains, of, tashkent, as, his, territory, and, noting, that, its, limits, formed, the, northeastern, sasanian, borderlands, with, the, kushan, empire, however, by, the, 5th, century, the, region, was, captured, by, the, rival, hephthalite, empire, the, hephthalites, conquered, the, territory, of, sogdiana, and, incorporated, it, into, their, empire, around, 479, ad, as, this, is, the, date, of, the, last, known, independent, embassy, of, the, sogdians, to, china, the, hephthalites, may, have, built, major, fortified, hippodamian, cities, rectangular, walls, with, an, orthogonal, network, of, streets, in, sogdiana, such, as, bukhara, and, panjikent, as, they, had, also, in, herat, continuing, the, city, building, efforts, of, the, kidarites, the, hephthalites, probably, ruled, over, a, confederation, of, local, rulers, or, governors, linked, through, alliance, agreements, one, of, these, vassals, may, have, been, asbar, ruler, of, vardanzi, who, also, minted, his, own, coinage, during, the, period, the, wealth, of, the, sasanian, ransoms, and, tributes, to, the, hephthalites, may, have, been, reinvested, in, sogdia, possibly, explaining, the, prosperity, of, the, region, from, that, time, sogdia, at, the, center, of, a, new, silk, road, between, china, to, the, sasanian, empire, and, the, byzantine, empire, became, extremely, prosperous, under, its, nomadic, elites, the, hephthalites, took, on, the, role, of, major, intermediary, on, the, silk, road, after, their, great, predecessor, the, kushans, and, contracted, local, sogdians, to, carry, on, the, trade, of, silk, and, other, luxury, goods, between, the, chinese, empire, and, the, sasanian, empire, because, of, the, hephthalite, occupation, of, sogdia, the, original, coinage, of, sogdia, came, to, be, flooded, by, the, influx, of, sasanian, coins, received, as, a, tribute, to, the, hephthalites, this, coinage, then, spread, along, the, silk, road, the, symbol, of, the, hephthalites, appears, on, the, residual, coinage, of, samarkand, probably, as, a, consequence, of, the, hephthalite, control, of, sogdia, and, becomes, prominent, in, sogdian, coinage, from, 500, to, 700, ad, including, in, the, coinage, of, their, indigenous, successors, the, ikhshids, 642, 755, ad, ending, with, the, muslim, conquest, of, transoxiana, the, turks, of, the, first, turkic, khaganate, and, the, sasanians, under, khosrow, i, allied, against, the, hephthalites, and, defeated, them, after, an, eight, day, battle, near, qarshi, the, battle, of, bukhara, perhaps, in, 557, the, turks, retained, the, area, north, of, the, oxus, including, all, of, sogdia, while, the, sasanians, obtained, the, areas, south, of, it, the, turks, fragmented, in, 581, and, the, western, turkic, khaganate, took, over, in, sogdia, archaeological, remains, suggest, that, the, turks, probably, became, the, main, trading, partners, of, the, sogdians, as, appears, from, the, tomb, of, the, sogdian, trader, an, jia, the, turks, also, appear, in, great, numbers, in, the, afrasiab, murals, of, samarkand, where, they, are, probably, shown, attending, the, reception, by, the, local, sogdian, ruler, varkhuman, in, the, 7th, century, ad, these, paintings, suggest, that, sogdia, was, a, very, cosmopolitan, environment, at, that, time, as, delegates, of, various, nations, including, chinese, and, korean, delegates, are, also, shown, from, around, 650, china, led, the, conquest, of, the, western, turks, and, the, sogdian, rulers, such, as, varkhuman, as, well, as, the, western, turks, all, became, nominal, vassals, of, china, as, part, of, the, anxi, protectorate, of, the, tang, dynasty, until, the, muslim, conquest, of, transoxiana, qutayba, ibn, muslim, 669, 716, governor, of, greater, khorasan, under, the, umayyad, caliphate, 661, 750, initiated, the, muslim, conquest, of, sogdia, during, the, early, 8th, century, with, the, local, ruler, of, balkh, offering, him, aid, as, an, umayyad, ally, however, when, his, successor, al, jarrah, ibn, abdallah, governed, khorasan, 717, 719, many, native, sogdians, who, had, converted, to, islam, began, to, revolt, when, they, were, no, longer, exempt, from, paying, the, tax, on, non, muslims, the, jizya, because, of, a, new, law, stating, that, proof, of, circumcision, and, literacy, in, the, quran, was, necessary, for, new, converts, with, the, aid, of, the, turkic, turgesh, the, sogdians, were, able, to, expel, the, umayyad, arab, garrison, from, samarkand, and, umayyad, attempts, to, restore, power, there, were, rebuffed, until, the, arrival, of, sa, id, ibn, amr, al, harashi, fl, 720, 735, the, sogdian, ruler, i, e, ikhshid, of, samarkand, gurak, who, had, previously, overthrown, the, pro, umayyad, sogdian, ruler, tarkhun, in, 710, decided, that, resistance, against, al, harashi, s, large, arab, force, was, pointless, and, thereafter, persuaded, his, followers, to, declare, allegiance, to, the, umayyad, governor, divashtich, r, 706, 722, the, sogdian, ruler, of, panjakent, led, his, forces, to, the, zarafshan, range, near, modern, zarafshan, tajikistan, whereas, the, sogdians, following, karzanj, the, ruler, of, pai, modern, kattakurgan, uzbekistan, fled, to, the, principality, of, farghana, where, their, ruler, at, tar, or, alutar, promised, them, safety, and, refuge, from, the, umayyads, however, at, tar, secretly, informed, al, harashi, of, the, sogdians, hiding, in, khujand, who, were, then, slaughtered, by, al, harashi, s, forces, after, their, arrival, from, 722, following, the, muslim, invasion, new, groups, of, sogdians, many, of, them, nestorian, christians, emigrated, to, the, east, where, the, turks, had, been, more, welcoming, and, more, tolerant, of, their, religion, since, the, time, of, sassanian, religious, persecutions, they, particularly, created, colonies, in, the, area, of, semirechye, where, they, continued, to, flourish, into, the, 10th, century, with, the, rise, of, the, karluks, and, the, kara, khanid, khanate, these, sogdians, are, known, for, producing, beautiful, silver, plates, with, eastern, christian, iconography, such, as, the, anikova, dish, the, umayyads, fell, in, 750, to, the, abbasid, caliphate, which, quickly, asserted, itself, in, central, asia, after, winning, the, battle, of, talas, along, the, talas, river, in, modern, talas, oblast, kyrgyzstan, in, 751, against, the, chinese, tang, dynasty, this, conflict, incidentally, introduced, chinese, papermaking, to, the, islamic, world, the, cultural, consequences, and, political, ramifications, of, this, battle, meant, the, retreat, of, the, chinese, empire, from, central, asia, it, also, allowed, for, the, rise, of, the, samanid, empire, 819, 999, a, persian, state, centered, at, bukhara, in, what, is, now, modern, uzbekistan, that, nominally, observed, the, abbasids, as, their, overlords, yet, retained, a, great, deal, of, autonomy, and, upheld, the, mercantile, legacy, of, the, sogdians, yet, the, sogdian, language, gradually, declined, in, favor, of, the, persian, language, of, the, samanids, the, ancestor, to, the, modern, tajik, language, the, spoken, language, of, renowned, poets, and, intellectuals, of, the, age, such, as, ferdowsi, 940, 1020, so, too, did, the, original, religions, of, the, sogdians, decline, zoroastrianism, buddhism, manichaeism, and, nestorian, christianity, disappeared, in, the, region, by, the, end, of, the, samanid, period, the, samanids, were, also, responsible, for, converting, the, surrounding, turkic, peoples, to, islam, the, samanids, occupied, the, sogdian, region, from, circa, 819, until, 999, establishing, their, capital, at, samarkand, 819, 892, and, then, at, bukhara, 892, 999, in, 999, the, samanid, empire, was, conquered, by, an, islamic, turkic, power, the, kara, khanid, khanate, 840, 1212, from, 1212, the, kara, khanids, in, samarkand, were, conquered, by, the, kwarazmians, soon, however, khwarezmia, was, invaded, by, the, early, mongol, empire, and, its, ruler, genghis, khan, destroyed, the, once, vibrant, cities, of, bukhara, and, samarkand, however, in, 1370, samarkand, saw, a, revival, as, the, capital, of, the, timurid, empire, the, turko, mongol, ruler, timur, brought, about, the, forced, immigration, to, samarkand, of, artisans, and, intellectuals, from, across, asia, transforming, it, not, only, into, a, trade, hub, but, also, into, one, of, the, most, important, cities, of, the, islamic, world, most, merchants, did, not, travel, the, entire, silk, road, but, would, trade, goods, through, middlemen, based, in, oasis, towns, such, as, khotan, or, dunhuang, the, sogdians, however, established, a, trading, network, across, the, 1500, miles, from, sogdiana, to, china, in, fact, the, sogdians, turned, their, energies, to, trade, so, thoroughly, that, the, saka, of, the, kingdom, of, khotan, called, all, merchants, suli, sogdian, whatever, their, culture, or, ethnicity, the, sogdians, had, learnt, to, become, expert, traders, from, the,

the, demise, of, the, kushan, empire, unlike, the, empires, of, antiquity, the, sogdian, region, was, not, a, territory, confined, within, fixed, borders, but, rather, a, network, of, city, states, from, one, oasis, to, another, linking, sogdiana, to, byzantium, india, indochina, and, china, sogdian, contacts, with, china, were, initiated, by, the, embassy, of, the, chinese, explorer, zhang,

of, sogdiana, as, kangju, following, zhang, qian, s, embassy, and, report, commercial, chinese, relations, with, central, asia, and, sogdiana, flourished, as, many, chinese, missions, were, sent, throughout, the, 1st, century, bc, in, his, shiji, published, in, 94, bc, chinese, historian, sima, qian, remarked, that, the, largest, of, these, embassies, to, foreign, states, numbered, several, hundred, persons, while, even, the, smaller, parties, included, over, 100, members, in, the, course, of, one, year, anywhere, from, five, to, six, to, over, ten, parties, would, be, sent, out, in, terms, of, the, silk, trade, the, sogdians, also, served, as, middlemen, between, the, chinese, han, empire, and, the, parthian, empire, of, the, middle, east, and, west, asia, sogdians, played, a, major, role, in, facilitating, trade, between, china, and, central, asia, along, the, silk, roads, as, late, as, the, 10th, century, their, language, serving, as, a, lingua, franca, for, asian, trade, as, far, back, as, the, 4th, century, subsequent, to, their, domination, by, alexander, the, great, the, sogdians, from, the, city, of, marakanda, samarkand, became, dominant, as, traveling, merchants, occupying, a, key, position, along, the, ancient, silk, road, they, played, an, active, role, in, the, spread, of, faiths, such, as, manicheism, zoroastrianism, and, buddhism, along, the, silk, road, the, chinese, sui, shu, book, of, sui, describes, sogdians, as, skilled, merchants, who, attracted, many, foreign, traders, to, their, land, to, engage, in, commerce, they, were, described, by, the, chinese, as, born, merchants, learning, their, commercial, skills, at, an, early, age, it, appears, from, sources, such, as, documents, found, by, sir, aurel, stein, and, others, that, by, the, 4th, century, they, may, have, monopolized, trade, between, india, and, china, a, letter, written, by, sogdian, merchants, dated, 313, ad, and, found, in, the, ruins, of, a, watchtower, in, gansu, was, intended, to, be, sent, to, merchants, in, samarkand, warning, them, that, after, liu, cong, of, han, zhao, sacked, luoyang, and, the, jin, emperor, fled, the, capital, there, was, no, worthwhile, business, there, for, indian, and, sogdian, merchants, furthermore, in, 568, ad, a, turko, sogdian, delegation, travelled, to, the, roman, emperor, in, constantinople, to, obtain, permission, to, trade, and, in, the, following, years, commercial, activity, between, the, states, flourished, put, simply, the, sogdians, dominated, trade, along, the, silk, road, from, the, 2nd, century, bc, until, the, 10th, century, suyab, and, talas, in, modern, day, kyrgyzstan, were, the, main, sogdian, centers, in, the, north, that, dominated, the, caravan, routes, of, the, 6th, to, 8th, centuries, their, commercial, interests, were, protected, by, the, resurgent, military, power, of, the, g, kt, rks, whose, empire, was, built, on, the, political, power, of, the, ashina, clan, and, economic, clout, of, the, sogdians, sogdian, trade, with, some, interruptions, continued, into, the, 9th, century, for, instance, camels, women, girls, silver, and, gold, were, seized, from, sogdia, during, a, raid, by, qapaghan, qaghan, 692, 716, ruler, of, the, second, turkic, khaganate, in, the, 10th, century, sogdiana, was, incorporated, into, the, uighur, empire, which, until, 840, encompassed, northern, central, asia, this, khaganate, obtained, enormous, deliveries, of, silk, from, tang, china, in, exchange, for, horses, in, turn, relying, on, the, sogdians, to, sell, much, of, this, silk, further, west, peter, b, golden, writes, that, the, uyghurs, not, only, adopted, the, writing, system, and, religious, faiths, of, the, sogdians, such, as, manichaeism, buddhism, and, christianity, but, also, looked, to, the, sogdians, as, mentors, while, gradually, replacing, them, in, their, roles, as, silk, road, traders, and, purveyors, of, culture, muslim, geographers, of, the, 10th, century, drew, upon, sogdian, records, dating, to, 750, 840, after, the, end, of, the, uyghur, empire, sogdian, trade, underwent, a, crisis, following, the, muslim, conquest, of, transoxiana, in, the, 8th, century, the, samanids, resumed, trade, on, the, northwestern, road, leading, to, the, khazars, and, the, urals, and, the, northeastern, one, toward, the, nearby, turkic, tribes, during, the, 5th, and, 6th, century, many, sogdians, took, up, residence, in, the, hexi, corridor, where, they, retained, autonomy, in, terms, of, governance, and, had, a, designated, official, administrator, known, as, a, sabao, which, suggests, their, importance, to, the, socioeconomic, structure, of, china, the, sogdian, influence, on, trade, in, china, is, also, made, apparent, by, a, chinese, document, which, lists, taxes, paid, on, caravan, trade, in, the, turpan, region, and, shows, that, twenty, nine, out, of, the, thirty, five, commercial, transactions, involved, sogdian, merchants, and, in, thirteen, of, those, cases, both, the, buyer, and, the, seller, were, sogdian, trade, goods, brought, to, china, included, grapes, alfalfa, and, sassanian, silverware, as, well, as, glass, containers, mediterranean, coral, brass, buddhist, images, roman, wool, cloth, and, baltic, amber, these, were, exchanged, for, chinese, paper, copper, and, silk, in, the, 7th, century, the, chinese, buddhist, pilgrim, xuanzang, noted, with, approval, that, sogdian, boys, were, taught, to, read, and, write, at, the, age, of, five, though, their, skill, was, turned, to, trade, disappointing, the, scholarly, xuanzang, he, also, recorded, the, sogdians, working, in, other, capacities, such, as, farmers, carpetweavers, glassmakers, and, woodcarvers, shortly, after, the, smuggling, of, silkworm, eggs, into, the, byzantine, empire, from, china, by, nestorian, christian, monks, the, 6th, century, byzantine, historian, menander, protector, writes, of, how, the, sogdians, attempted, to, establish, a, direct, trade, of, chinese, silk, with, the, byzantine, empire, after, forming, an, alliance, with, the, sasanian, ruler, khosrow, i, to, defeat, the, hephthalite, empire, ist, mi, the, g, kt, rk, ruler, of, the, first, turkic, khaganate, was, approached, by, sogdian, merchants, requesting, permission, to, seek, an, audience, with, the, sassanid, king, of, kings, for, the, privilege, of, traveling, through, persian, territories, in, order, to, trade, with, the, byzantines, ist, mi, refused, the, first, request, but, when, he, sanctioned, the, second, one, and, had, the, sogdian, embassy, sent, to, the, sassanid, king, the, latter, had, the, members, of, the, embassy, poisoned, maniah, a, sogdian, diplomat, convinced, ist, mi, to, send, an, embassy, directly, to, byzantium, s, capital, constantinople, which, arrived, in, 568, and, offered, not, only, silk, as, a, gift, to, byzantine, ruler, justin, ii, but, also, proposed, an, alliance, against, sassanid, persia, justin, ii, agreed, and, sent, an, embassy, to, the, turkic, khaganate, ensuring, the, direct, silk, trade, desired, by, the, sogdians, it, appears, however, that, direct, trade, with, the, sogdians, remained, limited, in, light, of, the, small, amount, of, roman, and, byzantine, coins, found, in, central, asian, and, chinese, archaeological, sites, belonging, to, this, era, although, roman, embassies, apparently, reached, han, china, from, 166, ad, onwards, and, the, ancient, romans, imported, han, chinese, silk, while, the, han, dynasty, chinese, imported, roman, glasswares, as, discovered, in, their, tombs, valerie, hansen, 2012, wrote, that, no, roman, coins, from, the, roman, republic, 507, 27, bc, or, the, principate, 27, bc, 330, ad, era, of, the, roman, empire, have, been, found, in, china, however, warwick, ball, 2016, upends, this, notion, by, pointing, to, a, hoard, of, sixteen, roman, coins, found, at, xi, an, china, formerly, chang, an, dated, to, the,

china, the, use, of, silver, coins, in, turfan, persisted, long, after, the, tang, campaign, against, karakhoja, and, chinese, conquest, of, 640, with, a, gradual, adoption, of, chinese, bronze, coinage, over, the, course, of, the, 7th, century, the, fact, that, these, eastern, roman, coins, were, almost, always, found, with, sasanian, persian, silver, coins, and, eastern, roman, gold, coins, were, used, more, as, ceremonial, objects, like, talismans, confirms, the, pre, eminent, importance, of, greater, iran, in, chinese, silk, road, commerce, of, central, asia, compared, to, eastern,

in, chinese, characters, from, left, to, right, instead, of, vertically, mirroring, the, direction, of, how, the, sogdian, alphabet, is, read, sogdians, of, dunhuang, also, commonly, formed, and, joined, lay, associations, among, their, local, communities, convening, at, sogdian, owned, taverns, in, scheduled, meetings, mentioned, in, their, epistolary, letters, sogdians, living, in, turfan, under, the, tang, dynasty, and, gaochang, kingdom, engaged, in, a, variety, of, occupations, that, included, farming, military, service, painting, leather, crafting, and, selling, products, such, as, iron, goods, the, sogdians, had, been, migrating, to, turfan, since, the, 4th, century, yet, the, pace, of, migration, began, to, climb, steadily, with, the, muslim, conquest, of, persia, and, fall, of, the, sasanian, empire, in, 651, followed, by, the, islamic, conquest, of, samarkand, in, 712, the, 6th, century, is, thought, to, be, the, peak, of, sogdian, culture, judging, by, its, highly, developed, artistic, tradition, by, this, point, the, sogdians, were, entrenched, in, their, role, as, the, central, asian, traveling, and, trading, merchants, transferring, goods, culture, and, religion, during, the, middle, ages, the, valley, of, the, zarafshan, around, samarkand, retained, its, sogdian, name, samarkand, according, to, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, medieval, arab, geographers, considered, it, one, of, the, four, fairest, regions, of, the, world, where, the, sogdians, moved, in, considerable, numbers, their, language, made, a, considerable, impact, for, instance, during, china, s, han, dynasty, the, native, name, of, the, tarim, basin, city, state, of, loulan, was, kroraina, possibly, from, greek, due, to, nearby, hellenistic, influence, however, centuries, later, in, 664, ad, the, tang, chinese, buddhist, monk, xuanzang, labelled, it, as, nafupo, which, according, to, hisao, matsuda, is, a, transliteration, of, the, sogdian, word, navapa, meaning, new, water, the, afrasiab, paintings, of, the, 6th, to, 7th, centuries, in, samarkand, uzbekistan, offer, a, rare, surviving, example, of, sogdian, art, the, paintings, showing, scenes, of, daily, life, and, events, such, as, the, arrival, of, foreign, ambassadors, are, located, within, the, ruins, of, aristocratic, homes, it, is, unclear, if, any, of, these, palatial, residences, served, as, the, official, palace, of, the, rulers, of, samarkand, the, oldest, surviving, sogdian, monumental, wall, murals, date, to, the, 5th, century, and, are, located, at, panjakent, tajikistan, in, addition, to, revealing, aspects, of, their, social, and, political, lives, sogdian, art, has, also, been, instrumental, in, aiding, historians, understanding, of, their, religious, beliefs, for, instance, it, is, clear, that, buddhist, sogdians, incorporated, some, of, their, own, iranian, deities, into, their, version, of, the, buddhist, pantheon, at, zhetysu, sogdian, gilded, bronze, plaques, on, a, buddhist, temple, show, a, pairing, of, a, male, and, female, deity, with, outstretched, hands, holding, a, miniature, camel, a, common, non, buddhist, image, similarly, found, in, the, paintings, of, samarkand, and, panjakent, the, sogdians, spoke, an, eastern, iranian, language, called, sogdian, closely, related, to, bactrian, khwarazmian, and, the, khotanese, saka, language, widely, spoken, eastern, iranian, languages, of, central, asia, in, ancient, times, sogdian, was, also, prominent, in, the, oasis, city, state, of, turfan, in, the, tarim, basin, region, of, northwest, china, in, modern, xinjiang, judging, by, the, sogdian, bugut, inscription, of, mongolia, written, c, 581, the, sogdian, language, was, also, an, official, language, of, the, first, turkic, khaganate, established, by, the, gokturks, sogdian, was, written, largely, in, three, scripts, the, sogdian, alphabet, the, syriac, alphabet, and, the, manichaean, alphabet, each, derived, from, the, aramaic, alphabet, which, had, been, widely, used, in, both, the, achaemenid, and, parthian, empires, of, ancient, iran, the, sogdian, alphabet, formed, the, basis, of, the, old, uyghur, alphabet, of, the, 8th, century, which, in, turn, was, used, to, create, the, mongolian, script, of, the, early, mongol, empire, during, the, 13th, century, later, in, 1599, the, jurchen, leader, nurhaci, decided, to, convert, the, mongolian, alphabet, to, make, it, suitable, for, the, manchu, people, the, yaghnobi, people, living, in, the, sughd, province, of, tajikistan, still, speak, a, descendant, of, the, sogdian, language, yaghnobi, is, largely, a, continuation, of, the, medieval, sogdian, dialect, from, the, osrushana, region, of, the, western, fergana, valley, the, great, majority, of, the, sogdian, people, assimilated, with, other, local, groups, such, as, the, bactrians, chorasmians, and, in, particular, with, persians, and, came, to, speak, persian, in, 819, the, persians, founded, the, samanid, empire, in, the, region, they, are, among, the, ancestors, of, the, modern, tajiks, numerous, sogdian, cognates, can, be, found, in, the, modern, tajik, language, although, the, latter, is, a, western, iranian, language, early, medieval, sogdian, costumes, can, be, divided, in, two, periods, hephtalitic, 5th, and, 6th, centuries, and, turkic, 7th, and, early, 8th, centuries, the, latter, did, not, become, common, immediately, after, the, political, dominance, of, the, g, kturks, but, only, in, c, 620, when, especially, following, western, turkic, khagan, ton, jazbgu, s, reforms, sogd, was, turkized, and, the, local, nobility, was, officially, included, in, the, khaganate, s, administration, for, both, sexes, clothes, were, tight, fitted, and, narrow, waists, and, wrists, were, appreciated, the, silhouettes, for, grown, men, and, young, girls, emphasized, wide, shoulders, and, narrowed, to, the, waist, the, silhouettes, for, female, aristocrats, were, more, complicated, the, sogdian, clothing, underwent, a, thorough, process, of, islamization, in, the, ensuing, centuries, with, few, of, the, original, elements, remaining, in, their, stead, turbans, kaftans, and, sleeved, coats, became, more, common, the, sogdians, practiced, a, variety, of, religious, faiths, however, zoroastrianism, was, most, likely, their, main, religion, as, demonstrated, by, material, evidence, such, as, the, discovery, in, samarkand, panjakent, and, er, kurgan, of, murals, depicting, votaries, making, offerings, before, fire, altars, and, ossuaries, holding, the, bones, of, the, dead, in, accordance, with, zoroastrian, ritual, at, turfan, sogdian, burials, shared, similar, features, with, traditional, chinese, practices, yet, they, still, retained, essential, zoroastrian, rituals, such, as, allowing, the, bodies, to, be, picked, clean, by, scavengers, before, burying, the, bones, in, ossuaries, they, also, sacrificed, animals, to, zoroastrian, deities, including, the, supreme, deity, ahura, mazda, zoroastrianism, remained, the, dominant, religion, among, sogdians, until, after, the, islamic, conquest, when, they, gradually, converted, to, islam, as, is, shown, by, richard, bulliet, s, conversion, curve, the, sogdian, religious, texts, found, in, china, and, dating, to, the, northern, dynasties, sui, and, tang, are, mostly, buddhist, translated, from, chinese, sources, manichaean, and, nestorian, christian, with, only, a, small, minority, of, zoroastrian, texts, but, tombs, of, sogdian, merchants, in, china, dated, to, the, last, third, of, the, 6th, century, show, predominantly, zoroastrian, motifs, or, zoroastrian, manichaean, syncretism, while, archaeological, remains, from, sogdiana, appear, fairly, iranian, and, conservatively, zoroastrian, however, the, sogdians, epitomized, the, religious, plurality, found, along, the, trade, routes, the, largest, body, of, sogdian, texts, are, buddhist, and, sogdians, were, among, the, principal, translators, of, buddhist, sutras, into, chinese, however, buddhism, did, not, take, root, in, sogdiana, itself, additionally, the, bulayiq, monastery, to, the, north, of, turpan, contained, sogdian, christian, texts, and, there, are, numerous, manichaean, texts, in, sogdiana, from, nearby, qocho, the, reconversion, of, sogdians, from, buddhism, to, zoroastrianism, coincided, with, the, adoption, of, zoroastrianism, by, the, sassanid, empire, of, persia, from, the, 4th, century, onwards, sogdian, buddhist, pilgrims, left, behind, evidence, of, their, travels, along, the, steep, cliffs, of, the, indus, river, and, hunza, valley, it, was, here, that, they, carved, images, of, the, buddha, and, holy, stupas, in, addition, to, their, full, names, in, hopes, that, the, buddha, would, grant, them, his, protection, the, sogdians, also, practiced, manichaeism, the, faith, of, mani, which, they, spread, among, the, uyghurs, the, uyghur, khaganate, 744, 840, ad, developed, close, ties, to, tang, china, once, it, had, aided, the, tang, in, suppressing, the, rebellion, of, an, lushan, and, his, g, kt, rk, successor, shi, siming, establishing, an, annual, trade, relationship, of, one, million, bolts, of, chinese, silk, for, one, hundred, thousand, horses, the, uyghurs, relied, on, sogdian, merchants, to, sell, much, of, this, silk, further, west, along, the, silk, road, a, symbiotic, relationship, that, led, many, uyghurs, to, adopt, manichaeism, from, the, sogdians, however, evidence, of, manichaean, liturgical, and, canonical, texts, of, sogdian, origin, remains, fragmentary, and, sparse, compared, to, their, corpus, of, buddhist, writings, the, uyghurs, were, also, followers, of, buddhism, for, instance, they, can, be, seen, wearing, silk, robes, in, the, pra, idhi, scenes, of, the, uyghur, bezeklik, buddhist, murals, of, xinjiang, china, particularly, scene, 6, from, temple, 9, showing, sogdian, donors, to, the, buddha, in, addition, to, puranic, cults, there, were, five, hindu, deities, known, to, have, been, worshipped, in, sogdiana, these, were, brahma, indra, mahadeva, shiva, narayana, and, vaishravana, the, gods, brahma, indra, and, shiva, were, known, by, their, sogdian, names, zravan, adbad, and, veshparkar, respectively, durga, a, mother, goddess, in, shaktism, may, be, represented, in, sogdian, art, as, a, four, armed, goddess, riding, atop, a, lion, as, seen, in, an, 8th, century, mural, from, panjakent, portable, fire, altars, can, be, associated, with, mahadeva, veshparkar, brahma, zravan, and, indra, abdab, according, to, braja, bih, r, kumar, among, the, sogdian, christians, known, in, china, from, inscriptions, and, texts, were, an, yena, a, christian, from, an, country, bukhara, mi, jifen, a, christian, from, mi, country,

venetian, explorer, and, merchant, marco, polo, noted, that, a, large, number, of, christian, churches, had, been, built, there, his, claim, is, confirmed, by, a, chinese, text, of, the, 14th, century, explaining, how, a, sogdian, named, mar, sargis, from, samarkand, founded, six, nestorian, christian, churches, there, in, addition, to, one, in, hangzhou, during, the, second, half, of, the, 13th, century, nestorian, christianity, had, existed, in, china, earlier, during, the, tang, dynasty, when, a, persian, monk, named, alopen, came, to, chang, an, in, 653, to, proselytize, as, described, in, a, dual, chinese, and, syriac, language, inscription, from, chang, an, modern, xi, an, dated, to, the, year, 781, within, the, syriac, inscription, is, a, list, of, priests, and, monks, one, of, whom, is, named, gabriel, the, archdeacon, of, xumdan, and, sarag, the, sogdian, names, for, the, chinese, capital, cities, chang, an, and, luoyang, respectively, in, regards, to, textual, material, the, earliest, christian, gospel, texts, translated, into, sogdian, coincide, with, the, reign, of, the, sasanian, persian, monarch, yazdegerd, ii, r, 438, 457, and, were, translated, from, the, peshitta, the, standard, version, of, the, bible, in, syriac, christianity, slavery, existed, in, china, since, ancient, times, although, during, the, han, dynasty, the, proportion, of, slaves, to, the, overall, population, was, roughly, 1, far, lower, than, the, estimate, for, the, contemporary, greco, roman, world, estimated, at, 15, of, the, entire, population, during, the, tang, period, slaves, were, not, allowed, to, marry, a, commoner, s, daughter, were, not, allowed, to, have, sexual, relations, with, any, female, member, of, their, master, s, family, and, although, fornication,

a, sogdian, girl, in, 639, ad, one, of, the, archaeologists, who, excavated, the, astana, site, wu, zhen, contends, that, although, many, households, along, the, silk, road, bought, individual, slaves, as, demonstrated, in, the, earlier, documents, from, niya, the, turpan, documents, point, to, a, massive, escalation, in, the, volume, of, the, slave, trade, in, 639, a, female, sogdian, slave, was, sold, to, a, chinese, man, as, recorded, in, an, astana, cemetery, legal, document, written, in, sogdian, khotan, and, kucha, were, places, where, women, were, commonly, sold, with, ample,
