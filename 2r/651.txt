the, history, of, writing, traces, the, development, of, writing, systems, and, how, their, use, transformed, and, was, transformed, by, different, societies, the, use, of, writing, prefigures, various, social, and, psychological, consequences, associated, with, literacy, and, literary, culture, with, each, historical, invention, of, writing, true, writing, systems, were, preceded, by, systems, of, ideographic, and, mnemonic, symbols, called, proto, writing, which, were, not, fully, capable, of, recording, spoken, language, true, writing, where, the, content, of, linguistic, utterances, can, be, accurately, reconstructed, by, later, readers, is, a, later, development, as, proto, writing, is, not, capable, of, fully, reflecting, the, grammar, and, lexicon, used, in, languages, it, is, often, difficult, or, impossible, to, deduce, what, the, author, intended, to, communicate, the, earliest, uses, of, writing, were, to, document, agricultural, transactions, and, contracts, in, ancient, sumer, but, it, was, soon, used, in, the, areas, of, finance, religion, government, and, law, writing, allowed, the, spread, of, these, social, modalities, and, their, associated, knowledge, and, ultimately, the, further, centralization, of, political, power, writing, systems, typically, satisfy, three, criteria, firstly, the, writing, must, have, some, purpose, or, meaning, to, it, and, a, point, must, be, communicated, by, the, text, secondly, writing, systems, make, use, of, specific, symbols, which, may, be, recorded, on, some, writing, medium, thirdly, the, symbols, used, in, writing, generally, correspond, to, elements, of, spoken, language, in, general, systems, of, symbolic, communication, like, signage, painting, maps, and, mathematics, are, distinguished, from, writing, systems, which, require, knowledge, of, an, associated, spoken, language, in, order, to, read, a, text, in, general, writing, systems, change, more, slowly, than, the, corresponding, spoken, languages, do, often, preserving, features, and, expressions, that, no, longer, exist, in, the, spoken, language, before, the, 20th, century, most, scholarly, theories, of, the, origins, of, writing, involved, some, form, of, monogenesis, the, assumption, that, writing, had, been, invented, only, once, namely, as, cuneiform, in, ancient, sumer, and, spread, across, the, world, from, there, via, cultural, diffusion, according, to, these, theories, writing, was, such, a, particular, technology, that, exposure, through, activities, like, trade, was, a, much, more, likely, means, of, acquisition, than, independent, reinvention, specifically, many, theories, were, dependent, on, a, literal, account, of, the, book, of, genesis, including, the, emphases, it, placed, on, mesopotamia, over, time, greater, awareness, of, the, systems, of, pre, columbian, mesoamerica, conclusively, established, that, writing, had, been, independently, invented, multiple, times, four, independent, inventions, of, writing, are, most, commonly, recognized, in, mesopotamia, c, 3400, 3100, bce, egypt, c, 3250, bce, china, before, c, 1250, bce, and, mesoamerica, before, c, 1, ce, sumerian, cuneiform, and, egyptian, hieroglyphs, are, considered, the, earliest, true, writing, systems, both, having, gradually, evolved, from, proto, writing, between, 3400, and, 3100, bce, the, proto, elamite, script, is, also, believed, to, have, been, in, use, during, this, period, regarding, egyptian, hieroglyphs, scholars, point, to, very, early, differences, with, sumerian, cuneiform, in, structure, and, style, as, to, why, the, two, systems, have, developed, independently, and, if, any, stimulus, diffusion, of, writing, did, occur, it, only, served, to, transmit, the, bare, idea, of, writing, between, cultures, due, to, the, lack, of, direct, evidence, for, the, transfer, of, writing, no, definitive, determination, has, been, made, as, to, the, origin, of, hieroglyphics, in, ancient, egypt, during, the, 1990s, symbols, originally, inscribed, between, 3400, and, 3200, bce, were, discovered, at, abydos, which, shed, some, doubt, on, the, previous, notion, that, the, mesopotamian, sign, system, predated, the, egyptian, one, however, scholars, have, noted, that, the, attestation, at, abydos, is, singular, and, sudden, while, the, gradual, evolution, of, the, mesopotamian, system, is, lengthy, and, well, documented, with, its, predecessor, token, system, used, in, agriculture, and, accounting, attested, as, early, as, 8000, bce, as, there, is, no, evidence, of, contact, between, the, chinese, shang, dynasty, c, 1600, c, 1050, bce, and, the, literate, civilizations, of, the, near, east, and, the, methods, of, logographic, and, phonetic, representation, in, chinese, characters, are, distinct, from, those, used, in, cuneiform, and, hieroglyphs, written, chinese, is, considered, to, be, an, independent, development, during, the, early, bronze, age, 3300, 2100, bce, the, first, writing, systems, evolved, from, systems, of, proto, writing, which, used, ideographic, and, mnemonic, symbols, to, communicate, information, but, did, not, record, human, language, directly, proto, writing, is, attested, as, early, as, the, 7th, millennium, bce, with, well, known, examples, including, other, examples, of, proto, writing, include, quipu, a, system, of, knotted, cords, used, as, mnemonic, devices, within, the, inca, empire, 15th, century, ce, prior, to, the, creation, of, the, yugtun, script, to, write, central, alaskan, yup, ik, c, 1900, the, uyaquq, people, also, used, a, system, of, pictographs, the, origins, of, writing, are, more, generally, attributed, to, the, start, of, the, pottery, phase, of, the, neolithic, when, clay, tokens, were, used, to, record, specific, amounts, of, livestock, or, commodities, these, tokens, were, initially, impressed, on, the, surface, of, round, clay, envelopes, and, then, stored, in, them, the, tokens, were, then, progressively, replaced, by, flat, tablets, on, which, signs, were, recorded, with, a, stylus, actual, writing, is, first, recorded, in, uruk, modern, iraq, at, the, end, of, the, 4th, millennium, bce, and, soon, after, in, various, parts, of, the, near, east, an, ancient, sumerian, poem, gives, the, first, known, story, of, the, invention, of, writing, because, the, messenger, s, mouth, was, heavy, and, he, couldn, t, repeat, the, message, the, lord, of, kulaba, patted, some, clay, and, put, words, on, it, like, a, tablet, until, then, there, had, been, no, putting, words, on, clay, the, emergence, of, writing, in, a, given, area, is, usually, followed, by, several, centuries, of, fragmentary, inscriptions, historians, mark, the, historicity, of, a, culture, by, the, presence, of, coherent, texts, written, by, the, culture, scholars, have, disagreed, concerning, when, prehistory, becomes, history, and, when, proto, writing, became, true, writing, sumerian, writing, evolved, from, a, system, of, clay, tokens, used, to, represent, commodities, by, the, end, of, the, 4th, millennium, bce, this, had, evolved, into, a, method, of, keeping, accounts, which, recorded, numbers, using, a, round, stylus, pressed, into, the, clay, at, different, angles, this, system, was, gradually, augmented, with, pictographic, marks, indicating, what, was, being, counted, which, were, made, using, a, sharp, stylus, by, the, 29th, century, bce, writing, used, a, wedge, shaped, stylus, and, included, phonetic, elements, representing, syllables, of, the, sumerian, language, and, gradually, replaced, round, stylus, and, sharp, stylus, markings, during, the, 27th, and, 26th, centuries, bce, finally, cuneiform, became, a, general, purpose, writing, system, with, logograms, syllables, and, numerals, from, the, 26th, century, bce, the, system, was, adapted, to, write, the, akkadian, language, and, from, there, to, others, such, as, hurrian, and, hittite, scripts, similar, in, appearance, to, this, writing, system, include, those, for, ugaritic, and, old, persian, geoffrey, sampson, states, that, egyptian, hieroglyphs, came, into, existence, a, little, after, sumerian, script, and, probably, invented, under, the, influence, of, the, latter, and, that, it, is, probable, that, the, general, idea, of, expressing, words, of, a, language, in, writing, was, brought, to, egypt, from, sumerian, mesopotamia, however, more, recent, scholars, have, held, that, the, evidence, for, direct, influence, is, sparse, during, the, 1990s, the, discovery, of, glyphs, at, abydos, dated, between, 3400, and, 3200, bce, has, challenged, the, hypothesis, that, writing, diffused, from, mesopotamia, to, egypt, pointing, instead, to, the, independent, development, of, writing, within, egypt, the, abydos, glyphs, found, in, tomb, u, j, are, written, on, ivory, and, are, likely, labels, for, other, goods, found, in, the, grave, while, sign, usage, in, mesopotamian, tokens, is, attested, c, 8000, bce, egyptian, writing, appears, suddenly, in, the, late, 4th, millennium, bce, frank, j, yurco, states, that, depictions, of, pharaonic, iconography, such, as, the, royal, crowns, horus, falcons, and, victory, scenes, were, concentrated, in, the, upper, egyptian, naqada, and, a, group, cultures, he, further, elaborates, that, egyptian, writing, arose, in, naqadan, upper, egypt, and, a, group, nubia, and, not, in, the, delta, cultures, where, the, direct, western, asian, contact, was, made, further, vitiates, the, mesopotamian, influence, argument, egyptian, scholar, gamal, mokhtar, argues, that, the, inventory, of, hieroglyphic, symbols, derived, from, fauna, and, flora, used, in, the, signs, are, essentially, african, and, in, regards, to, writing, we, have, seen, that, a, purely, nilotic, hence, african, origin, not, only, is, not, excluded, but, probably, reflects, the, reality, although, he, acknowledges, the, geographical, location, of, egypt, made, it, a, receptacle, for, many, influences, writing, was, of, political, importance, to, the, egyptian, empire, and, literacy, was, concentrated, among, an, educated, elite, of, scribes, only, people, from, certain, backgrounds, were, allowed, to, train, as, scribes, in, the, service, of, temple, royal, and, military, authorities, the, first, alphabetic, writing, was, developed, by, workers, in, the, sinai, peninsula, to, write, semitic, languages, around, 2000, bce, this, script, worked, by, giving, egyptian, hieratic, letters, semitic, sound, values, the, ge, ez, script, native, to, ethiopia, and, eritrea, descends, from, the, ancient, south, arabian, script, which, had, initially, been, used, to, write, early, ge, ez, texts, most, other, alphabets, in, the, world, today, either, descended, from, this, one, innovation, many, via, the, phoenician, alphabet, or, were, directly, inspired, by, its, design, in, italy, about, 500, years, separated, the, early, old, italic, scripts, from, plautus, c, 750, 250, bce, and, in, the, case, of, the, germanic, peoples, the, corresponding, time, span, is, again, similar, from, the, first, elder, futhark, inscriptions, to, early, texts, like, the, abrogans, c, 200, 750, ce, these, early, abjads, remained, of, marginal, importance, for, several, centuries, and, it, is, only, towards, the, end, of, the, bronze, age, that, forms, of, proto, sinaitic, script, split, into, the, proto, canaanite, alphabet, c, 1400, bce, the, undeciphered, byblos, syllabary, and, the, south, arabian, alphabet, c, 1200, bce, proto, canaanite, which, was, probably, influenced, by, the, byblos, syllabary, in, turn, inspired, the, ugaritic, alphabet, c, 1300, bce, anatolian, hieroglyphs, are, an, indigenous, hieroglyphic, script, native, to, western, anatolia, used, to, record, the, hieroglyphic, luwian, language, it, first, appeared, on, luwian, royal, seals, from, the, 14th, century, bce, the, earliest, attested, chinese, writing, comprise, the, body, of, inscriptions, on, oracle, bones, and, bronze, vessels, dating, to, the, late, shang, period, c, 1200, c, 1050, bce, with, the, earliest, of, these, dated, to, around, c, 1250, bce, cretan, hieroglyphs, are, found, on, artifacts, of, crete, 2nd, millennium, bce, mm, i, to, mm, iii, overlapping, with, linear, a, from, mm, iia, at, the, earliest, linear, b, the, writing, system, of, the, mycenaean, greeks, has, been, deciphered, while, linear, a, has, yet, to, be, deciphered, the, sequence, and, the, geographical, spread, of, the, three, overlapping, but, distinct, writing, systems, can, be, summarized, as, follows, of, several, symbol, systems, used, in, pre, columbian, mesoamerica, the, maya, script, appears, to, be, the, best, developed, and, has, been, fully, deciphered, the, earliest, inscriptions, identifiable, as, maya, date, to, the, 3rd, century, bce, and, writing, was, in, continuous, use, from, the, 1st, century, ce, until, shortly, after, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, conquistadors, in, the, 16th, century, maya, writing, used, logograms, complemented, by, a, set, of, syllabic, glyphs, the, phoenician, alphabet, is, the, continuation, of, the, proto, canaanite, alphabet, into, the, iron, age, it, in, turn, gave, rise, to, the, aramaic, and, greek, alphabets, to, date, most, of, the, writing, systems, used, throughout, afro, eurasia, descend, from, either, aramaic, or, greek, the, greek, alphabet, was, the, first, to, introduce, letters, representing, vowel, sounds, it, and, its, descendant, in, the, latin, alphabet, gave, rise, to, several, european, scripts, in, the, first, several, centuries, ce, including, the, runic, gothic, and, cyrillic, alphabets, the, aramaic, alphabet, evolved, into, the, brahmic, scripts, of, india, as, well, as, the, hebrew, arabic, and, syriac, abjads, with, descendants, spread, as, far, as, the, mongolian, script, the, south, arabian, alphabet, gave, rise, to, the, ge, ez, abugida, the, history, of, the, greek, alphabet, began, in, at, least, the, early, 8th, century, bce, when, the, greeks, adapted, the, phoenician, alphabet, for, use, with, their, own, language, the, letters, of, the, greek, alphabet, are, more, or, less, the, same, as, those, of, the, phoenician, alphabet, and, in, modern, times, both, alphabets, are, arranged, in, the, same, order, those, adapting, the, phoenician, system, added, three, letters, to, the, end, of, the, series, called, the, supplementals, several, varieties, of, the, greek, alphabet, developed, one, known, as, the, cumae, alphabet, was, used, west, of, athens, and, in, southern, italy, the, other, variation, known, as, eastern, greek, was, used, in, present, day, turkey, and, by, the, athenians, and, eventually, the, rest, of, the, world, that, spoke, greek, adopted, this, variation, after, first, writing, right, to, left, like, the, phoenicians, the, greeks, eventually, chose, to, write, from, left, to, right, occasionally, however, the, writer, would, start, the, next, line, where, the, previous, line, finished, so, that, the, lines, would, read, alternately, left, to, right, then, right, to, left, and, so, on, this, is, known, as, boustrophedon, writing, which, imitated, the, path, of, an, ox, drawn, plough, and, was, used, until, the, sixth, century, greek, is, in, turn, the, source, for, all, the, modern, scripts, of, europe, the, most, widespread, descendant, of, greek, is, the, latin, script, named, for, the, latins, a, central, italian, people, who, came, to, dominate, europe, with, the, rise, of, rome, the, romans, learned, writing, in, about, the, 5th, century, bce, from, the, etruscan, civilization, who, used, one, of, a, number, of, italic, scripts, derived, from, the, western, greeks, due, to, the, cultural, dominance, of, the, roman, state, the, other, old, italic, scripts, have, not, survived, in, any, great, quantity, and, the, etruscan, language, is, mostly, lost, with, the, collapse, of, the, western, roman, state, literary, development, became, largely, confined, to, the, byzantine, empire, and, the, sassanid, empire, where, the, primary, literary, languages, were, greek, and, persian, though, other, languages, such, as, syriac, and, coptic, were, also, important, the, spread, of, islam, in, the, 7th, century, brought, about, the, rapid, establishment, of, arabic, as, a, major, literary, language, in, much, of, the, mediterranean, and, central, asia, arabic, and, persian, quickly, began, to, overshadow, greek, s, role, as, a, language, of, scholarship, arabic, script, was, adopted, as, the, primary, script, of, the, persian, language, and, the, old, turkic, language, this, script, also, heavily, influenced, the, development, of, the, cursive, scripts, of, greek, the, slavic, languages, latin, and, other, languages, the, arabic, language, also, served, to, spread, the, hindu, arabic, numeral, system, throughout, europe, by, the, 11th, century, the, city, of, c, rdoba, andalusia, in, what, is, now, southern, spain, had, become, one, of, the, world, s, foremost, intellectual, centers, and, was, the, site, of, the, largest, library, in, europe, by, the, 14th, century, the, renaissance, in, europe, led, to, a, temporary, revival, of, the, importance, of, greek, and, a, slow, revival, of, latin, as, a, significant, literary, language, a, similar, though, smaller, emergence, occurred, in, eastern, europe, especially, in, russia, at, the, same, time, arabic, and, persian, began, a, slow, decline, in, importance, as, the, islamic, golden, age, ended, the, revival, of, literacy, development, in, western, europe, led, to, many, innovations, in, the, latin, alphabet, and, the, diversification, of, the, alphabet, to, codify, the, phonologies, of, the, various, languages, the, nature, of, writing, has, been, constantly, evolving, particularly, due, to, the, development, of, new, technologies, over, the, centuries, the, pen, printing, press, computer, and, mobile, phone, are, all, technological, developments, which, have, altered, what, is, written, and, the, medium, through, which, the, written, word, is, produced, the, mediums, materials, and, technologies, used, by, literate, societies, for, writing, help, determine, how, writing, systems, work, what, writing, is, used, for, and, what, social, impact, it, has, for, example, the, physical, durability, of, the, materials, used, directly, determines, what, historical, examples, of, writing, have, survived, for, later, analysis, while, bodies, of, inscriptions, in, stone, bone, or, metal, are, attested, from, each, ancient, literate, society, much, manuscript, culture, is, attested, only, indirectly, the, common, manuscript, materials, in, mesopotamia, world, were, the, tablet, and, the, roll, the, former, probably, having, a, chaldean, origin, the, latter, an, egyptian, the, tablets, of, the, chaldeans, are, small, pieces, of, clay, somewhat, crudely, shaped, into, a, form, resembling, a, pillow, and, thickly, inscribed, with, cuneiform, characters, similar, use, has, been, seen, in, hollow, cylinders, or, prisms, of, six, or, eight, sides, formed, of, fine, terracotta, sometimes, glazed, on, which, the, characters, were, traced, with, a, small, stylus, in, some, specimens, so, minutely, as, to, require, the, aid, of, a, magnifying, glass, in, egypt, the, principal, writing, material, was, of, quite, a, different, sort, wooden, tablets, are, found, pictured, on, the, monuments, while, papyrus, was, also, used, as, early, as, the, 4th, millennium, bce, the, papyrus, reed, grew, chiefly, in, lower, egypt, and, had, various, economic, means, for, writing, the, pith, was, taken, out, and, divided, by, a, pointed, instrument, into, the, thin, pieces, of, which, it, is, composed, it, was, then, flattened, by, pressure, and, the, strips, glued, together, other, strips, being, placed, at, right, angles, to, them, so, that, a, roll, of, any, length, might, be, manufactured, writing, seems, to, have, become, more, widespread, with, the, invention, of, papyrus, in, egypt, that, this, material, was, in, use, in, egypt, from, a, very, early, period, is, evidenced, by, still, existing, papyrus, of, the, earliest, theban, dynasties, as, the, papyrus, being, in, great, demand, and, exported, to, all, parts, of, the, world, became, very, costly, other, materials, were, often, used, instead, of, it, among, which, is, mentioned, leather, a, few, leather, mills, of, an, early, period, having, been, found, in, the, tombs, parchment, using, sheepskins, left, after, the, wool, was, removed, for, cloth, was, sometimes, cheaper, than, papyrus, which, had, to, be, imported, outside, egypt, with, the, invention, of, wood, pulp, paper, the, cost, of, writing, material, began, a, steady, decline, wood, pulp, paper, is, still, used, today, and, in, recent, times, efforts, have, been, made, in, order, to, improve, bond, strength, of, fibers, two, main, areas, of, examination, in, this, regard, have, been, dry, strength, of, paper, and, wet, web, strength, the, former, involves, examination, of, the, physical, properties, of, the, paper, itself, while, the, latter, involves, using, additives, to, improve, strength, according, to, denise, schmandt, besserat, writing, had, its, origins, in, the, counting, and, cataloguing, of, agricultural, produce, and, then, economic, transactions, involving, the, produce, government, tax, rolls, followed, thereafter, written, documents, became, essential, for, the, accumulation, and, accounting, of, wealth, by, individuals, the, state, and, religious, organizations, as, well, as, the, transactions, of, trade, loans, inheritance, and, documentation, of, ownership, with, such, documentation, and, accounting, larger, accumulations, of, wealth, became, more, possible, along, with, the, power, that, accompanied, wealth, most, prominently, to, the, benefit, of, royalty, the, state, and, religions, contracts, and, loans, supported, the, growth, of, long, distance, international, trade, with, accompanying, networks, for, import, and, export, supporting, the, rise, of, capitalism, paper, money, initially, appearing, in, china, in, the, 11th, century, and, other, financial, instruments, relied, on, writing, initially, in, the, form, of, letters, and, then, evolving, into, specialized, genres, to, explain, the, transactions, and, guarantees, from, individuals, banks, or, governments, of, value, inhering, in, the, documents, with, the, growth, of, economic, activity, in, late, medieval, and, renaissance, europe, sophisticated, methods, of, accounting, and, calculating, value, emerged, with, such, calculations, both, carried, out, in, writing, and, explained, in, manuals, the, creation, of, corporations, then, proliferated, documents, surrounding, organization, management, the, distribution, of, shares, and, records, management, economic, theory, itself, only, began, to, be, developed, in, the, latter, eighteenth, century, through, the, writings, of, such, theorists, as, fran, ois, quesnay, and, adam, smith, even, the, concepts, of, an, economy, and, a, national, economy, were, established, through, their, texts, and, the, texts, of, their, colleagues, since, then, economics, has, developed, as, a, field, with, many, authors, contributing, texts, to, the, professional, literature, and, governments, collecting, data, instituting, policies, and, creating, institutions, to, manage, and, advance, their, economies, deirdre, mccloskey, has, examined, the, rhetorical, strategies, and, discursive, construction, of, modern, economic, theory, graham, smart, has, examined, in, depth, how, the, bank, of, canada, uses, writing, to, cooperatively, produce, policies, based, on, economic, data, and, then, to, communicate, strategically, with, relevant, publics, private, legal, documents, for, the, sale, of, land, appeared, in, mesopotamia, in, the, early, 3rd, millennium, bce, not, long, after, the, initial, appearance, of, cuneiform, writing, the, first, written, legal, codes, followed, shortly, thereafter, c, 2100, bce, with, the, most, well, known, being, the, code, of, hammurabi, inscribed, on, stone, stelae, throughout, babylon, c, 1750, bce, while, ancient, egypt, did, not, have, codified, laws, legal, decrees, and, private, contracts, did, appear, in, the, old, kingdom, c, 2150, bce, the, torah, comprising, the, first, five, books, of, the, hebrew, bible, codified, the, laws, of, ancient, israel, many, other, codes, were, to, follow, in, greece, and, rome, with, roman, law, to, serve, as, a, model, for, church, canon, law, and, secular, law, throughout, much, of, europe, during, later, periods, in, china, the, earliest, indications, of, written, codifications, of, law, or, books, of, punishments, are, inscriptions, on, bronze, vessels, in, 536, bce, the, earliest, extant, full, set, of, laws, dates, back, to, the, qin, and, han, dynasties, which, set, out, a, full, system, of, social, control, and, governance, with, criminal, procedures, and, accountability, for, both, government, officials, and, citizens, these, laws, required, complex, reporting, and, documenting, procedures, to, facilitate, hierarchical, supervision, from, the, village, up, to, the, imperial, center, while, common, law, developed, in, a, mostly, oral, environment, in, england, after, the, roman, period, with, the, return, of, the, church, and, the, norman, conquest, customary, law, began, to, be, inscribed, as, were, precedents, of, the, courts, however, many, elements, remained, oral, with, documents, only, memorializing, public, oaths, wills, land, transfers, court, judgments, and, ceremonies, during, the, late, medieval, period, however, documents, gained, authority, for, agreements, transactions, and, laws, writing, has, been, central, to, expanding, many, of, the, core, functions, of, governance, through, law, regulation, taxation, and, documentary, surveillance, of, citizens, all, dependent, on, growth, of, bureaucracy, which, elaborates, and, administers, rules, and, policies, and, maintains, records, these, developments, which, rely, on, writing, increase, the, power, and, extent, of, states, at, the, same, time, writing, has, increased, the, ability, of, citizens, to, become, informed, about, the, operations, of, the, state, to, become, more, organized, in, expressing, needs, and, concerns, to, identify, with, regions, and, states, and, to, form, constituencies, with, particular, views, and, interests, the, history, of, journalism, is, closely, linked, to, citizen, information, regional, and, national, identity, and, expression, of, interests, these, changes, have, greatly, influenced, the, nature, of, states, increasing, the, visibility, of, people, and, their, views, no, matter, what, the, form, of, governance, is, extensive, bureaucracies, arose, in, the, ancient, near, east, and, china, which, relied, on, a, literate, class, of, scribes, and, bureaucrats, in, the, ancient, near, east, this, was, carried, out, through, the, formation, of, scribal, schools, while, in, china, this, led, to, a, series, of, written, imperial, examinations, based, on, classic, texts, which, in, effect, regulated, education, over, millennia, literacy, remained, associated, with, rise, in, the, government, bureaucracy, and, printing, as, it, emerged, was, tightly, controlled, by, the, government, with, vernacular, texts, only, emerging, later, and, then, being, limited, in, their, range, up, through, the, early, twentieth, century, and, the, fall, of, the, ching, dynasty, in, ancient, greece, and, rome, class, distinctions, of, citizen, and, slave, wealthy, and, poor, limited, education, and, participation, in, medieval, and, early, modern, europe, church, dominance, of, education, both, before, and, for, a, time, after, the, reformation, expressed, the, importance, of, religion, in, the, control, of, the, state, and, state, bureaucracies, in, europe, and, its, colonies, in, the, americas, the, introduction, of, the, printing, press, and, decreasing, cost, of, paper, and, printing, allowed, for, greater, access, of, ordinary, citizens, to, gain, information, about, the, government, and, conditions, in, other, regions, within, the, jurisdictions, the, reformation, with, an, emphasis, on, individual, reading, of, sacred, texts, eventually, increased, the, spread, of, literacy, beyond, the, governing, classes, and, opened, the, door, to, wider, knowledge, and, criticism, of, government, actions, divisions, in, english, society, during, the, sixteenth, century, the, english, civil, war, of, the, seventeenth, century, and, the, increased, role, of, parliament, that, followed, along, with, the, splitting, of, political, religious, control, were, accompanied, by, pamphlet, wars, newspaper, publishing, and, journalism, having, origins, in, commercial, information, soon, was, to, offer, political, information, and, was, instrumental, to, the, formation, of, a, public, sphere, newspapers, were, instrumental, in, the, sharing, of, information, fostering, discussion, and, forming, political, identities, in, the, american, revolution, and, then, the, new, nation, the, circulation, of, newspapers, also, created, urban, regional, and, state, identification, in, the, latter, nineteenth, century, and, after, a, focus, on, national, news, that, followed, telegraphy, and, the, emergence, of, newspapers, with, national, circulation, along, with, scripted, national, radio, and, television, news, broadcasts, also, created, horizons, of, attention, through, the, twentieth, century, with, both, benefits, and, costs, military, knowledge, of, strategies, and, devices, date, back, to, the, ancient, worlds, of, egypt, india, china, greece, and, rome, with, both, historical, accounts, and, manuals, for, conducting, war, after, printing, was, introduced, in, the, west, manuals, for, construction, of, fortifications, and, battle, strategies, were, widely, reproduced, as, nations, frequently, were, in, conflict, with, the, growth, of, chemistry, and, other, sciences, however, knowledge, of, new, weaponry, was, frequently, restricted, to, secret, documents, other, documents, also, of, limited, distribution, developed, around, policies, production, and, distribution, of, the, new, weaponry, by, world, war, i, both, the, allied, and, axis, powers, applied, new, technologies, based, on, scientific, advances, to, military, uses, particularly, chemical, weapons, with, over, 5000, scientists, engaged, in, developing, and, producing, weaponry, while, attempting, to, limit, access, to, the, information, in, secret, documents, the, drive, towards, secret, knowledge, including, novel, research, and, not, just, applications, of, prior, knowledge, became, especially, intense, with, the, race, to, develop, nuclear, weapons, in, world, war, ii, as, in, the, us, manhattan, project, aviation, rocketry, radar, encryption, and, computing, were, also, the, subject, of, classified, documents, this, system, of, classification, of, knowledge, continued, after, wwii, ended, as, the, cold, war, ensued, the, tension, between, the, needs, for, military, secrecy, open, scientific, research, and, citizen, deliberation, over, military, policy, led, in, the, united, states, led, to, the, atomic, energy, act, of, 1946, which, created, civilian, control, but, through, a, continuing, regime, of, classified, knowledge, much, of, what, we, consider, knowledge, is, inscribed, in, written, text, and, is, the, result, of, communal, processes, of, production, sharing, and, evaluation, among, social, groups, and, institutions, bound, together, with, the, aim, of, producing, and, disseminating, knowledge, bearing, texts, the, contemporary, world, identifies, such, social, groups, as, disciplines, and, their, products, as, disciplinary, literatures, the, invention, of, writing, facilitated, the, sharing, comparing, criticizing, and, evaluating, of, texts, resulting, in, knowledge, becoming, a, more, communal, property, across, wider, geographic, and, temporal, domains, religious, texts, formed, the, common, knowledge, of, scriptural, religions, and, knowledge, of, those, sacred, scriptures, became, the, focus, of, institutions, of, religious, belief, interpretation, and, schooling, as, discussed, in, the, section, on, writing, and, religion, in, this, article, other, sections, in, this, article, are, devoted, to, knowledge, specific, to, the, economy, the, law, and, governance, this, section, is, devoted, to, the, development, of, secular, knowledge, and, its, related, social, organizations, institutions, and, educational, practices, in, other, domains, scholars, have, disagreed, concerning, when, written, record, keeping, became, more, like, literature, but, the, oldest, surviving, literary, texts, date, from, a, full, millennium, after, the, invention, of, writing, the, earliest, literary, author, known, by, name, is, enheduanna, who, is, credited, as, the, author, of, a, number, of, works, of, sumerian, literature, including, exaltation, of, inanna, in, the, sumerian, language, during, the, 24th, century, bce, the, next, earliest, named, author, is, ptahhotep, who, is, credited, with, authoring, the, maxims, of, ptahhotep, an, instructional, book, for, young, men, in, egyptian, composed, in, the, 23rd, century, bce, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, is, an, early, notable, poem, but, it, can, also, be, seen, as, a, political, glorification, of, the, historical, king, gilgamesh, of, sumer, whose, natural, and, supernatural, accomplishments, are, recounted, the, identification, of, sacred, religious, texts, codified, distinct, belief, systems, and, became, the, basis, of, the, modern, concept, of, religion, the, reproduction, and, spread, of, these, texts, became, associated, with, these, scriptural, religions, and, their, spread, and, thus, were, central, to, proselytizing, these, sacred, books, created, obligations, of, believers, to, read, or, to, follow, the, teachings, of, priests, charged, with, the, reading, interpretation, and, application, of, these, texts, well, known, examples, of, such, scriptures, are, the, torah, the, bible, quran, vedas, bhagavad, gita, and, sutras, but, there, are, far, more, religious, texts, through, the, histories, of, different, religions, with, many, still, in, current, use, these, texts, because, of, their, spread, tended, to, foster, generalized, guides, for, moral, and, ethical, behavior, at, least, for, all, members, of, the, religious, community, but, often, these, guidelines, were, considered, applicable, to, all, humans, as, in, the, ten, commandments, in, mesopotamia, and, egypt, scribes, became, important, for, roles, beyond, the, initiating, roles, in, the, economy, governance, and, law, they, became, the, producers, and, stewards, of, astronomy, and, calendars, divination, and, literary, culture, schools, developed, in, tablet, houses, which, also, archived, repositories, of, knowledge, in, ancient, india, the, brahman, caste, became, stewards, of, texts, that, aggregated, and, codified, oral, knowledge, those, texts, then, became, the, authoritative, basis, for, a, continuing, tradition, of, oral, education, a, case, in, point, is, the, work, of, p, ini, the, linguist, who, analyzed, and, codified, knowledge, of, sanskrit, syntax, prosody, and, grammar, mathematics, astronomy, and, medicine, were, also, subjects, of, classic, indian, learning, and, were, codified, in, classic, texts, less, is, known, about, mayan, aztec, and, other, mesoamerican, learning, because, of, the, destruction, of, texts, by, the, conquistadors, but, it, is, known, that, scribes, were, revered, elite, children, attended, schools, and, the, study, of, astronomy, map, making, historical, chronicles, and, genealogy, flourished, in, china, after, the, qin, dynasty, attempted, to, remove, all, traces, of, the, competing, confucian, tradition, the, han, dynasty, made, philological, knowledge, the, qualification, for, the, government, bureaucracy, so, as, to, restore, knowledge, that, was, in, danger, of, vanishing, the, imperial, examination, system, for, the, civil, service, functioned, for, two, millennia, and, consisted, of, a, written, exam, based, on, knowledge, of, classical, texts, to, support, students, obtaining, government, positions, through, the, written, examination, schools, focused, on, those, same, texts, and, the, associated, philological, knowledge, these, texts, covered, philosophical, religious, legal, astronomical, hydrological, mathematical, military, and, medical, knowledge, printing, as, it, emerged, largely, served, the, knowledge, needs, of, the, bureaucracy, and, the, monastery, with, substantial, vernacular, printing, only, emerging, around, the, 15th, century, while, socrates, thought, writing, an, inferior, means, of, transmission, of, learning, recounted, in, the, phaedrus, we, know, of, his, works, through, plato, s, written, accounts, of, his, dialogues, havelock, also, connects, the, philosophical, work, of, plato, socrates, and, aristotle, with, literacy, as, it, enabled, the, development, of, critical, thinking, via, the, analysis, of, permanent, texts, written, both, by, the, author, and, their, peers, aristotle, wrote, treatises, and, lectures, which, were, the, core, of, education, at, the, lyceum, along, with, the, may, volumes, collected, in, the, lyceum, s, library, the, stoics, and, epicureans, also, wrote, and, taught, during, the, same, period, in, athens, although, we, now, have, only, fragments, of, their, works, greek, writers, were, the, founding, writers, of, many, other, fields, of, knowledge, herodotus, and, thucydides, writing, during, the, 5th, century, bce, in, athens, are, considered, the, founders, of, history, transforming, genealogy, and, mythic, accounts, into, systematic, investigations, of, events, thucydides, developed, a, more, critical, neutral, history, through, the, examination, of, documents, transcription, of, speeches, and, interviews, hippocrates, during, the, same, period, authored, several, major, works, of, medicine, codifying, and, advancing, the, knowledge, of, this, field, in, the, 2nd, century, ce, the, greek, trained, physician, galen, went, to, rome, where, he, wrote, numerous, works, that, dominated, european, medicine, through, the, renaissance, hellenized, writers, in, egypt, also, produced, compendia, of, knowledge, using, the, resources, of, the, great, library, at, alexandria, such, as, euclid, s, elements, which, remains, a, standard, reference, work, in, geometry, ptolemy, s, almagest, an, astronomy, treatise, was, used, throughout, the, middle, ages, roman, scholars, continued, the, practice, of, writing, compendia, of, knowledge, including, varro, pliny, the, elder, and, strabo, while, much, of, roman, accomplishment, was, in, material, culture, of, construction, vitruvius, documented, much, of, the, contemporary, practice, to, influence, design, until, today, agriculture, also, became, an, important, area, for, manuals, such, as, palladius, compendium, numerous, manuals, of, rhetoric, and, rhetorical, education, that, were, to, influence, future, generations, also, appeared, such, as, the, anonymous, rhetorica, ad, herennium, cicero, s, de, oratore, and, quintilian, s, institutio, oratoria, with, the, fall, of, rome, the, middle, east, became, the, crossroads, for, learning, with, knowledge, bearing, texts, from, the, west, and, east, meeting, in, constantinople, damascus, and, then, baghdad, the, house, of, wisdom, with, a, large, library, was, founded, where, greek, works, of, medicine, philosophy, mathematics, and, astronomy, were, translated, into, arabic, along, with, indian, works, on, mathematics, and, therapeutics, to, these, texts, philosophers, such, as, al, kindi, and, avicenna, and, astronomers, such, as, al, farghani, made, new, contributions, muhammad, ibn, musa, al, khwarizmi, authored, the, first, work, on, algebra, drawing, on, both, greek, and, indian, resources, the, centrality, of, the, quran, in, islam, also, led, to, growth, of, arabic, linguistics, from, baghdad, knowledge, and, texts, were, to, flow, back, to, south, asia, and, down, through, africa, with, a, large, collection, of, books, and, an, educational, center, around, the, sankhore, mosque, in, timbuktu, the, seat, of, the, songhai, empire, during, this, period, the, deposed, abbasid, caliphate, moved, its, seat, of, power, and, learning, to, c, rdoba, now, in, spain, where, they, founded, a, major, library, which, reintroduced, many, of, the, classic, texts, back, into, europe, along, with, texts, of, arab, learning, the, reintroduction, of, classical, texts, into, europe, through, the, library, and, intercultural, intellectual, culture, in, c, rdoba, including, works, of, plato, aristotle, euclid, ptolemy, and, galen, along, with, arabic, texts, such, as, by, avicenna, and, al, kharazami, created, a, need, for, interpretation, lectures, and, scholarship, to, make, those, works, more, accessible, to, scholars, in, monasteries, and, urban, centers, during, the, twelfth, century, universities, emerged, from, these, clusters, of, scholars, in, italy, at, bologna, in, spain, at, salamanca, in, france, at, paris, and, in, england, at, oxford, by, 1500, there, were, at, least, sixty, universities, throughout, europe, enrolling, at, least, three, quarters, of, a, million, students, each, of, the, four, faculties, liberal, arts, theology, law, and, medicine, was, oriented, around, the, transmission, of, classical, texts, rather, than, the, production, of, fresh, knowledge, beyond, lectures, and, commentaries, this, form, of, scholastic, education, continued, well, into, the, 17th, century, in, some, locations, and, disciplines, johannes, gutenberg, s, european, introduction, of, the, moveable, type, printing, press, c, 1450, created, new, opportunities, for, the, production, and, widespread, distribution, of, books, fostering, much, new, writing, with, particular, consequences, for, the, development, of, knowledge, as, documented, by, elizabeth, eisenstein, the, production, and, distribution, of, knowledge, was, no, longer, tied, to, monasteries, or, universities, with, their, libraries, and, collections, of, scribal, copies, in, the, ensuing, centuries, a, politically, and, increasingly, religiously, divided, europe, no, single, authority, was, able, to, censor, or, control, the, production, of, books, while, universities, remained, attached, to, disseminating, traditional, texts, publishing, houses, became, the, new, centers, of, knowledge, production, and, publishing, houses, in, different, jurisdictions, led, to, a, diversity, of, ideas, becoming, available, as, books, moved, across, borders, and, scholars, came, to, see, themselves, as, citizens, of, the, republic, of, letters, the, comparison, of, multiple, editions, of, traditional, texts, led, to, improved, textual, scholarship, the, ability, to, share, and, compare, results, from, many, regions, and, enlist, more, people, into, the, production, of, science, soon, led, to, the, development, of, early, modern, science, books, of, medicine, began, to, incorporate, observations, from, contemporary, surgery, and, dissections, including, printed, plates, providing, graphic, displays, to, improve, knowledge, of, anatomy, with, many, copies, of, traditional, books, and, new, books, appearing, debates, arose, over, the, value, of, each, in, what, became, known, as, the, battle, of, the, books, maps, and, discoveries, of, exploration, and, colonization, also, were, recorded, in, books, and, governmental, records, often, with, the, purpose, of, economic, exploitation, as, in, the, general, archive, of, the, indies, in, seville, but, also, to, satisfy, curiosity, about, the, world, printing, also, made, possible, the, invention, and, development, of, scientific, journals, with, the, journal, des, s, avans, appearing, in, france, and, the, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, in, england, both, in, 1665, over, the, years, these, journals, proliferated, and, became, the, basis, of, disciplines, and, disciplinary, literature, genres, reporting, experiments, and, other, scientific, observations, and, theories, developed, over, the, ensuing, centuries, to, produce, modern, practices, of, disciplinary, publication, with, the, extensive, intertexts, which, represent, the, collective, pursuits, of, disciplinary, knowledge, the, availability, of, scientific, and, disciplinary, books, and, journals, also, facilitated, the, development, of, modern, practices, of, scientific, reference, and, citation, these, developments, from, the, impact, of, printing, on, the, growth, of, knowledge, contributed, to, the, scientific, revolution, science, in, the, renaissance, and, during, the, enlightenment, in, the, 18th, century, dissident, scottish, and, english, dissident, universities, began, offering, practical, instruction, in, rhetoric, and, writing, to, enable, non, elite, students, to, influence, contemporary, events, only, in, the, 19th, century, did, the, universities, in, some, countries, begin, making, place, for, the, writing, of, new, knowledge, turning, them, in, the, ensuing, years, from, primarily, disseminating, knowledge, through, the, reading, of, classical, texts, to, becoming, institutions, devoted, to, both, reading, and, writing, the, creation, of, research, seminars, and, the, associated, seminar, papers, in, history, and, philology, in, german, universities, were, a, significant, starting, point, for, the, reform, of, the, university, professorships, in, philology, history, economy, theology, psychology, sociology, mathematics, and, the, sciences, were, to, emerge, over, the, century, and, the, german, model, of, disciplinary, research, university, was, to, influence, the, organization, of, universities, in, england, and, the, united, states, with, another, model, developing, in, france, both, emphasized, production, of, new, knowledge, by, faculty, and, acquisition, thereof, by, students, in, elite, british, universities, writing, instruction, was, supported, by, the, tutorial, system, with, weekly, writing, by, students, for, their, tutors, while, in, the, united, states, regular, courses, in, writing, were, often, required, starting, in, the, late, 19th, century, with, writing, across, the, curriculum, becoming, an, increasing, focus, particularly, towards, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, walter, j, ong, jack, goody, and, eric, a, havelock, were, among, the, earliest, to, systematically, argue, for, the, psychological, and, intellectual, consequences, of, literacy, ong, argued, that, the, introduction, of, writing, changed, the, form, of, human, consciousness, from, sensing, the, immediacy, of, the, spoken, word, to, the, critical, distance, and, systematization, of, words, which, could, be, graphically, displayed, and, ordered, such, as, in, the, works, of, peter, ramus, havelock, attributed, the, emergence, of, greek, philosophic, thought, to, the, use, of, the, written, word, which, allowed, the, comparison, of, beliefs, and, belief, systems, and, the, critical, examination, of, concepts, jack, goody, argued, that, written, language, fostered, such, practices, as, categorization, making, lists, following, formulas, developing, recipes, and, prescriptions, and, ultimately, making, and, recording, experiments, these, practices, changed, the, intellectual, and, psychological, orientation, of, those, who, engaged, with, them, while, recognizing, the, possibilities, of, all, these, psychological, and, intellectual, changes, that, accompanied, these, literate, practices, sylvia, scribner, and, michael, cole, argued, that, these, changes, did, not, come, universally, or, automatically, with, literacy, but, rather, were, dependent, on, the, social, uses, made, of, literacy, in, their, local, contexts, they, carried, out, field, observation, and, experiments, among, the, vai, people, of, west, africa, for, whom, the, psychological, impacts, of, literacy, vary, due, to, the, three, different, contexts, in, which, locals, learn, to, read, and, write, the, vai, language, english, and, arabic, practical, skills, secular, education, and, religious, education, respectively, european, literacy, was, associated, with, european, style, schooling, and, fostered, among, other, things, syllogistic, reasoning, and, logical, problem, solving, arabic, literacy, was, associated, with, the, religious, training, of, madrasas, and, fostered, among, other, things, heightened, rote, memory, literacy, in, the, written, forms, of, vai, associated, with, daily, practices, of, making, requests, and, explaining, tasks, increased, anticipation, of, audience, knowledge, and, needs, along, with, rebus, solving, as, the, written, language, used, rebus, like, icons
