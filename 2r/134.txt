developed, but, none, of, them, are, thought, to, have, exceeded, 1, per, cent, of, the, population, while, it, is, clear, that, warfare, undoubtedly, took, many, lives, during, this, period, the, census, figures, do, not, support, the, idea, that, tens, of, millions, were, wiped, out, solely, from, warfare, other, factors, such, as, mass, famines, and, infectious, diseases, due, to, the, collapse, of, sustaining, governance, and, migrations, out, of, china, must, be, taken, into, account, in, the, late, eastern, han, dynasty, due, to, natural, disasters, and, social, unrest, the,

in, addition, because, of, the, collapse, of, the, imperial, court, those, worn, copper, coins, were, not, melted, and, reminted, and, many, privately, minted, coins, appeared, in, the, three, kingdoms, period, newly, minted, coins, never, made, their, way, into, currency, due, to, the, collapse, of, the, coinage, cao, wei, officially, declared, silk, cloth, and, grains, as, the, main, currencies, in, 221, in, economic, terms, the, division, of, the, three, kingdoms, reflected, a, reality, that, long, endured, even, during, the, northern, song, dynasty, 700, years, after, the, three, kingdoms, period, it, was, possible, to, think, of, china, as, being, composed, of, three, great, regional, markets, the, status, of, the, northwest, was, slightly, ambivalent, as, it, had,
