the, army, split, up, oranmiyan, s, force, was, too, small, to, make, a, successful, attack, so, he, wandered, the, southern, shore, of, the, niger, river, until, reaching, bussa, there, the, local,

later, deified, as, the, deity, of, thunder, and, lightning, ajaka, was, restored, after, sango, s, death, ajaka, returned, to, the, throne, thoroughly, more, warlike, his, successor, kori, managed, to, conquer, the, rest, of, what, later, historians, would, refer, to, as, metropolitan, oyo, the, heart, of, metropolitan, oyo, was, its, capital, at, oyo, ile, also, known, as, oya, katunga, old, oyo, or, oyo, oro, the, two, most, important, structures, in, oyo, ile, were, the, afin, or, palace, of, the, oba, and, his, market, the, palace, was, at, the, center, of, the, city, close, to, the, oba, s, market, called, oja, oba, around, the, capital, was, an, enormous, earthen, wall, for, defense, with, 17, gates, the, importance, of, the, two, large, structures, the, palace, and, the, oja, oba, signified, the, importance, of, the, king, in, oyo, oyo, had, grown, into, a, formidable, inland, power, by, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, for, over, a, century, the, yoruba, state, had, expanded, at, the, expense, of, its, neighbors, during, the, reign, of, onigbogi, oyo, suffered, military, defeats, at, the, hands, of, the, nupe, led, by, tsoede, sometime, around, 1535, the, nupe, occupied, oyo, and, forced, its, ruling, dynasty, to, take, refuge, in, the, kingdom, of, borgu, the, nupe, sacked, the, capital, destroying, oyo, as, a, regional, power, until, the, early, 17th, century, the, yoruba, of, oyo, went, through, an, interregnum, of, 80, years, as, an, exiled, dynasty, after, its, defeat, by, the, nupe, they, re, established, oyo, to, be, more, centralized, and, expansive, than, ever, the, people, created, a, government, that, established, its, power, over, a, vast, territory, during, the, 17th, century, oyo, began, a, long, stretch, of, growth, becoming, a, major, empire, oyo, never, encompassed, all, yoruba, people, but, it, was, the, most, populous, kingdom, in, yoruba, history, the, key, to, the, yoruba, rebuilding, of, oyo, was, a, stronger, military, and, a, more, centralized, government, taking, a, cue, from, their, nupe, enemies, whom, they, called, tapa, the, yoruba, rearmed, with, armor, and, cavalry, oba, ofinran, alaafin, of, oyo, succeeded, in, regaining, oyo, s, original, territory, from, the, nupe, a, new, capital, oyo, igboho, was, constructed, and, the, original, became, known, as, old, oyo, the, next, oba, eguguojo, conquered, nearly, all, of, yorubaland, after, this, oba, orompoto, led, attacks, to, obliterate, the, nupe, to, ensure, oyo, was, never, threatened, by, them, again, during, the, reign, of, oba,

buffer, independent, town, between, oyo, and, benin, yet, oyo, continued, to, expand, the, oyo, allowed, autonomy, to, the, southeast, of, metropolitan, oyo, where, the, non, yoruba, areas, could, also, act, as, a, buffer, between, oyo, and, benin, by, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, the, ewe, and, aja, states, of, modern, benin, republic, were, paying, tribute, to, oyo, the, reinvigorated, oyo, empire, began, raiding, southward, as, early, as, 1682, by, the, end, of, its, military, expansion, oyo, s, borders, would, extend, to, the, coast, some, 100, kilometres, 62, mi, southwest, of, its, capital, it, met, little, serious, opposition, until, the, early, 18th, century, in, 1728, the, oyo, empire, invaded, the, kingdom, of, dahomey, in, a, major, campaign, dominated, by, its, cavalry, dahomey, warriors, on, the, other, hand, had, no, cavalry, but, many, firearms, their, gunshots, scared, the, oyo, cavalry, horses, and, prevented, their, charging, the, dahomey, army, also, built, fortifications, such, as, trenches, which, effectively, made, the, use, of, cavalry, useless, the, battle, lasted, four, days, but, the, oyo, were, eventually, victorious, after, reinforcements, arrived, dahomey, was, forced, to, pay, tribute, to, oyo, the, oyo, invaded, dahomey, 11, times, before, finally, subjugating, the, kingdom, in, 1748, with, its, cavalry, oyo, campaigned, over, great, distances, the, oyo, army, was, able, to, attack, defensive, fortifications, but, it, was, harder, to, supply, an, army, and, they, withdrew, when, supplies, ran, out, the, oyo, did, not, use, guns, in, its, major, conquests, the, military, waited, until, the, 19th, century, to, adopt, them, in, 1764, a, joint, akyem, dahomey, oyo, force, defeated, an, invading, ashanti, army, the, victory, among, the, alliance, defined, the, borders, between, the, neighboring, states, oyo, led, a, successful, campaign, into, mahi, territory, north, of, dahomey, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, yoruba, also, made, use, of, the, forces, of, their, tributaries, for, instance, they, accomplished, a, 1784, naval, blockade, of, badagri, with, an, oyo, dahomey, lagos, force, at, the, beginning, the, people, were, concentrated, in, metropolitan, oyo, with, imperial, expansion, oyo, reorganized, to, better, manage, its, vast, holdings, within, and, outside, of, yorubaland, it, was, divided, into, four, layers, defined, by, relation, to, the, core, of, the, empire, these, layers, were, metropolitan, oyo, southern, yorubaland, the, egbado, corridor, and, ajaland, metropolitan, oyo, corresponded, more, or, less, to, the, oyo, state, prior, to, the, nupe, invasion, this, was, the, hub, of, the, empire, where, the, yoruba, spoke, the, oyo, dialect, metropolitan, oyo, was, divided, into, six, provinces, with, three, on, the, west, side, of, the, ogun, river, and, three, to, the, river, s, east, each, province, was, supervised, by, a, governor, appointed, directly, by, the, alaafin, of, oyo, the, second, layer, of, the, empire, was, composed, of, the, towns, closest, to, oyo, ile, which, were, recognized, as, brothers, this, area, was, south, of, metropolitan, oyo, and, its, yoruba, inhabitants, spoke, different, dialects, from, that, of, oyo, these, tributary, states, were, led, by, their, own, rulers, titled, obas, who, were, confirmed, by, the, alaafin, of, oyo, the, empire, s, third, layer, was, the, egbado, corridor, southwest, of, yorubaland, this, area, was, inhabited, by, the, egba, and, egbado, and, guaranteed, oyo, s, trade, with, the, coast, the, egba, and, egbado, tributaries, were, allowed, like, their, yoruba, counterparts, to, rule, themselves, they, were, however, supervised, by, ajele, these, were, agents, appointed, by, the, alaafin, of, oyo, to, oversee, his, interest, and, monitor, commerce, the, lead, representative, of, oyo, in, the, corridor, was, the, olu, ruler, of, the, town, of, ilaro, ajaland, was, the, last, layer, added, to, the, empire, it, was, the, most, restive, and, distant, and, kept, in, line, with, threats, of, expeditions, against, it, this, territory, extended, from, the, non, yoruba, areas, west, of, the, egbado, corridor, far, into, ewe, controlled, territory, in, modern, togo, this, area, like, all, tributary, states, was, allowed, a, fair, degree, of, autonomy, as, long, as, taxes, were, paid, the, orders, from, oyo, were, strictly, followed, and, access, to, local, markets, was, provided, to, oyo, merchants, the, oyo, often, demanded, tribute, in, slaves, the, tributary, chiefs, of, other, kingdoms, sometimes, made, war, on, others, to, capture, slaves, for, this, purpose, oyo, was, known, to, punish, disobedience, by, wholesale, slaughter, of, the, erring, community, as, it, accomplished, in, allada, in, 1698, the, oyo, empire, developed, a, highly, sophisticated, political, structure, to, govern, its, territorial, domains, scholars, have, not, determined, how, much, of, this, structure, existed, before, the, nupe, invasion, after, reemerging, from, exile, in, the, early, 17th, century, oyo, took, on, a, noticeably, more, militant, character, the, influence, of, an, aggressive, yoruba, culture, is, exemplified, in, the, standards, placed, on, the, oba, king, and, the, roles, of, his, council, the, oba, meaning, king, in, the, yoruba, language, at, oyo, who, was, referred, to, as, the, alaafin, of, oyo, alaafin, means, owner, of, the, palace, in, yoruba, was, the, head, of, the, empire, and, supreme, overlord, of, the, people, he, was, responsible, for, keeping, tributaries, safe, from, attack, settling, internal, quarrels, between, sub, rulers, and, mediating, between, those, sub, rulers, and, their, people, the, alaafin, of, oyo, was, also, expected, to, give, his, subordinates, honours, and, presents, in, return, all, sub, rulers, had, to, pay, homage, to, the, oba, and, renew, their, allegiance, at, annual, ceremonies, the, most, important, of, these, was, the, bere, festival, marking, the, acclamation, of, successful, rule, by, the, alaafin, after, the, bere, festival, peace, in, yorubaland, was, supposed, to, last, for, three, years, the, king, could, not, be, disposed, of, but, could, be, compelled, to, commit, suicide, if, he, was, no, longer, wanted, this, was, done, by, sending, bashorun, the, prime, minister, to, present, either, an, empty, calabash, or, a, dish, of, parrot, s, eggs, to, him, and, pass, a, sentence, of, rejection, known, as, awon, eniyan, koo, i, e, the, people, reject, you, the, world, rejects, you, and, the, gods, reject, you, also, according, to, tradition, the, alaafin, was, expected, to, commit, ritual, suicide, thereafter, the, basorun, was, a, key, political, office, in, the, oyo, often, likened, to, the, role, of, the, prime, minister, and, chancellor, of, the, kingdom, during, the, 16th, to, 18th, centuries, controlled, by, ibariba, families, serving, as, the, head, of, the, seven, highest, ranking, non, royal, lords, in, the, oyo, mesi, council, the, bashorun, played, a, crucial, role, in, advising, the, king, and, representing, non, royal, interests, their, power, was, substantial, especially, in, the, selection, of, a, new, king, from, 1570, to, 1750, several, basoruns, had, ibariba, or, non, yor, b, origins, such, as, basorun, magaji, woruda, biri, yamba, jambu, and, gaa, the, bashorun, s, duties, were, closely, tied, to, warfare, leading, military, campaigns, for, the, state, their, position, was, second, only, to, the, alaafin, the, oyo, empire, was, not, a, purely, hereditary, monarchy, nor, was, it, an, absolute, one, the, oyo, mesi, selected, the, alaafin, he, was, not, always, closely, related, to, his, predecessor, although, he, did, have, to, be, descended, from, oranmiyan, a, son, of, oduduwa, and, to, hail, from, the, ona, isokun, ward, which, is, one, of, the, three, royal, wards, at, the, beginning, of, the, oyo, empire, the, alaafin, s, eldest, son, usually, succeeded, his, father, upon, the, throne, this, sometimes, led, the, crown, prince, known, as, the, aremo, to, hasten, the, death, of, his, father, to, prevent, this, occurrence, it, became, traditional, for, the, crown, prince, to, be, made, to, commit, ritual, suicide, upon, his, father, s, death, independent, of, the, succession, the, aremo, was, quite, powerful, in, his, own, right, for, instance, by, custom, the, alaafin, abstained, from, leaving, the, palace, except, during, the, important, festivals, which, in, practice, curtailed, his, power, by, contrast, the, aremo, often, left, the, palace, this, led, the, noted, historian, s, johnson, to, observe, the, father, is, the, king, of, the, palace, and, the, son, the, king, for, the, general, public, the, two, councils, which, checked, the, alaafin, tended, to, select, a, weak, alaafin, after, the, reign, of, a, strong, one, to, keep, the, office, from, becoming, too, powerful, the, alaafin, of, oyo, appointed, certain, religious, and, government, officials, who, were, usually, eunuchs, these, officials, were, known, as, the, ilari, or, half, heads, because, of, the, custom, of, shaving, half, of, their, heads, and, applying, what, was, believed, to, be, a, magical, substance, into, them, the, hundreds, of, ilari, were, divided, evenly, between, the, sexes, junior, members, of, the, ilari, did, menial, tasks, while, seniors, acted, as, guards, or, sometimes, messengers, to, the, other, world, via, sacrifice, their, titles, related, to, the, king, such, as, oba, l, olu, the, king, is, supreme, or, madarikan, do, not, oppose, him, they, carried, red, and, green, fans, as, credentials, of, their, status, all, sub, courts, of, oyo, had, ilari, who, acted, as, both, spies, and, taxmen, oyo, appointed, these, to, visit, and, sometimes, reside, in, dahomey, and, the, egbado, corridor, to, collect, taxes, and, spy, on, dahomey, s, military, successes, so, that, the, alaafin, of, oyo, could, get, his, cut, while, the, alaafin, of, oyo, was, the, supreme, overlord, of, the, people, he, was, not, without, checks, on, his, power, the, oyo, mesi, and, the, yoruba, earth, cult, known, as, ogboni, kept, the, oba, s, power, in, check, the, oyo, mesi, spoke, for, the, politicians, while, the, ogboni, spoke, for, the, people, and, were, backed, by, the, power, of, religion, the, power, of, the, alaafin, of, oyo, to, the, oyo, mesi, and, ogboni, depended, on, his, personal, character, and, political, shrewdness, the, oyo, mesi, were, the, seven, principal, councilors, of, the, state, they, constituted, the, electoral, council, and, possessed, legislative, powers, led, by, the, bashorun, acting, as, prime, minister, and, consisting, of, the, agbaakin, the, samu, the, alapini, the, laguna, the, akiniku, and, the, ashipa, they, represented, the, voice, of, the, nation, and, had, the, chief, responsibility, of, protecting, the, interests, of, the, empire, the, alaafin, was, required, to, take, counsel, from, them, whenever, any, important, matter, affecting, the, state, occurred, each, chief, had, a, state, duty, to, perform, at, court, every, morning, and, afternoon, each, also, had, a, deputy, whom, they, would, send, to, the, alaafin, if, their, absence, was, unavoidable, the, oyo, mesi, developed, as, a, check, on, the, alaafin, s, power, preventing, the, alaafin, from, being, an, autocrat, they, compelled, many, alaafins, to, commit, suicide, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, the, head, of, the, council, of, oyo, mesi, the, bashorun, consulted, the, ifa, oracle, before, the, royal, succession, for, approval, from, the, gods, new, alaafins, of, oyo, were, therefore, seen, as, being, appointed, by, the, gods, they, were, regarded, as, ekeji, orisa, meaning, deputy, of, the, gods, the, bashorun, had, the, final, say, on, the, nomination, of, the, new, alaafin, his, power, rivaling, that, of, the, king, himself, for, example, the, bashorun, orchestrated, many, religious, festivals, he, did, this, in, addition, to, being, commander, in, chief, of, the, army, which, gave, him, considerable, independent, religious, authority, chief, among, the, responsibilities, of, the, bashorun, was, the, all, important, festival, of, orun, this, religious, divination, held, every, year, was, to, determine, if, the, members, of, the, mesi, still, held, favour, with, the, alaafin, if, the, council, decided, the, disapproval, of, the, alaafin, the, bashorun, presented, the, alaafin, with, an, empty, calabash, or, parrot, s, eggs, as, a, sign, that, he, must, commit, suicide, this, was, the, only, way, to, remove, the, alaafin, because, he, could, not, legally, be, deposed, once, given, the, calabash, or, the, parrot, s, eggs, the, alaafin, his, eldest, son, the, aremo, and, his, personal, counselor, within, the, oyo, mesi, the, asamu, all, had, to, commit, suicide, to, renew, the, government, the, suicide, ceremony, took, place, during, the, orun, festival, the, oyo, mesi, did, not, enjoy, absolute, power, either, while, the, oyo, mesi, wielded, political, influence, the, ogboni, represented, the, popular, opinion, backed, by, the, authority, of, religion, and, therefore, the, views, of, the, oyo, mesi, could, be, moderated, by, the, ogboni, there, were, checks, and, balances, on, the, power, of, the, alaafin, and, the, oyo, mesi, and, thus, no, one, was, arrogated, absolute, power, the, ogboni, was, a, very, powerful, secret, society, composed, of, aristocratic, freemen, noted, for, their, age, wisdom, and, importance, in, religious, and, political, affairs, its, members, enjoyed, immense, power, over, the, common, people, due, to, their, religious, station, a, testament, to, how, widespread, the, institution, was, is, the, fact, that, there, were, and, still, are, ogboni, councils, at, nearly, all, sub, courts, within, yorubaland, aside, from, their, duties, with, respect, to, the, worship, of, the, earth, they, were, responsible, for, judging, any, case, dealing, with, the, spilling, of, blood, the, leader, of, the, ogboni, the, oluwo, had, the, unqualified, right, of, direct, access, to, the, alaafin, of, oyo, on, any, matter, there, was, a, high, degree, of, professionalism, in, the, army, of, the, oyo, empire, its, military, success, was, due, in, large, part, to, its, cavalry, as, well, as, the, leadership, and, courage, of, oyo, officers, and, warriors, because, its, main, geographic, focus, was, north, of, the, forest, oyo, enjoyed, easier, farming, and, thus, a, steady, growth, in, population, this, contributed, to, oyo, s, ability, to, consistently, field, a, large, force, there, was, also, an, entrenched, military, culture, in, oyo, where, victory, was, obligatory, and, defeat, carried, the, duty, of, committing, suicide, this, do, or, die, policy, no, doubt, contributed, to, the, military, aggressiveness, of, oyo, s, generals, the, oyo, empire, was, one, of, the, only, yoruba, states, to, adopt, cavalry, it, did, so, because, most, of, its, territory, was, in, the, northern, savannah, the, origin, of, the, cavalry, is, unclear, however, the, nupe, borgu, and, hausa, in, neighbouring, territories, also, used, cavalry, and, may, have, had, the, same, historical, source, oyo, was, able, to, purchase, horses, from, the, north, and, maintain, them, in, metropolitan, oyo, because, of, partial, freedom, from, the, tsetse, fly, cavalry, was, the, long, arm, of, the, oyo, empire, late, 16th, and, 17th, century, expeditions, were, composed, entirely, of, cavalry, there, were, drawbacks, to, this, oyo, could, not, maintain, its, cavalry, army, in, the, south, but, could, raid, at, will, despite, its, drawbacks, oyo, managed, to, amass, one, hundred, thousand, cavalry, horsemen, earning, the, fear, of, many, kingdoms, and, empires, across, west, africa, cavalry, in, highly, developed, societies, such, as, oyo, was, divided, into, light, and, heavy, heavy, cavalry, on, larger, imported, horses, was, armed, with, bow, arrows, light, cavalry, on, smaller, indigenous, ponies, was, armed, with, clubs, chain, mail, armor, was, imported, into, yorubaland, from, the, north, and, may, have, been, worn, by, oyo, cavalrymen, infantry, in, the, region, around, the, oyo, empire, was, uniform, in, both, armour, and, armament, all, infantry, in, the, region, carried, shields, swords, and, lances, of, one, type, or, another, shields, were, four, feet, tall, and, two, feet, wide, and, made, of, elephant, or, ox, hide, a, 3, foot, long, 0, 91, m, heavy, sword, was, the, main, armament, for, close, combat, the, yoruba, and, their, neighbours, used, triple, barbed, javelins, which, could, be, thrown, accurately, from, about, 30, paces, the, oyo, empire, like, many, empires, before, it, used, both, local, and, tributary, forces, to, expand, its, domains, the, structure, of, the, oyo, military, prior, to, its, imperial, period, was, simple, and, closer, aligned, to, the, central, government, in, metropolitan, oyo, this, may, have, been, adequate, in, the, 14th, century, when, oyo, controlled, only, its, heartland, but, to, make, and, maintain, conquest, farther, away, the, structure, underwent, several, changes, oyo, maintained, a, semi, standing, army, of, specialist, cavalry, soldiers, called, the, eso, the, esho, or, formally, the, eso, of, ikoyi, these, were, 70, junior, war, chiefs, who, were, nominated, by, the, oyo, mesi, and, confirmed, by, the, alaafin, of, oyo, the, eso, were, appointed, for, their, military, skill, without, regard, to, heritage, although, de, facto, dynasties, of, eso, were, also, known, to, exist, the, eso, were, led, by, the, aare, ona,

aare, ona, kakanfo, who, attacked, iwere, ile, his, paternal, home, was, to, die, miserably, refused, to, comply, a, further, cause, was, given, in, 1795, when, awole, ordered, afonja, to, attack,

could, not, agree, on, a, candidate, this, power, vacuum, led, to, the, ascendancy, of, powerful, military, and, regional, commanders, like, adegun, the, onikoyi, and, solagberu, the, otun, are, ona, kakanfo, shehu, alimi, a, fulani, chief, who, was, the, leader, of, the, growing, muslim, population, in, oyo, also, rose, to, power, at, this, time, these, new, elements, had, lost, regard, for, the, office, of, the, alaafin, due, to, the, various, political, wranglings, and, the, lack, of, a, central, authority, at, the, time, this, situation, eventually, led, to, afonja, seceding, ilorin, from, oyo, in, 1817, with, the, help, of, oyo, muslims, in, 1823, after, afonja, had, been, killed, by, his, erstwhile, allies, shehu, alimi, and, solagberu, who, was, himself, later, killed, by, alimi, s,

have, something, to, do, with, the, fact, that, most, of, the, empire, s, soldiers, and, hence, cavalry, were, stationed, at, ilorin, under, the, command, of, afonja, and, later, alimi, s, successors, ilorin, then, besieged, offa, and, started, raiding, burning, and, pillaging, villages, in, oyo, eventually, destroying, the, capital, oyo, ile, in, 1835, as, oyo, tore, itself, apart, via, political,
