the, medes, were, an, ancient, iranian, people, who, spoke, the, median, language, and, who, inhabited, an, area, known, as, media, between, western, and, northern, iran, around, the, 11th, century, bc, they, occupied, the, mountainous, region, of, northwestern, iran, and, the, northeastern, and, eastern, region, of, mesopotamia, in, the, vicinity, of, ecbatana, present, day, hamadan, their, consolidation, in, iran, is, believed, to, have, occurred, during, the, 8th, century, bc, in, the, 7th, century, bc, all, of, western, iran, and, some, other, territories, were, under, median, rule, but, their, precise, geographic, extent, remains, unknown, although, they, are, generally, recognized, as, having, an, important, place, in, the, history, of, the, ancient, near, east, the, medes, have, left, no, written, source, to, reconstruct, their, history, which, is, known, only, from, foreign, sources, such, as, the, assyrians, babylonians, armenians, and, greeks, as, well, as, a, few, iranian, archaeological, sites, which, are, believed, to, have, been, occupied, by, medes, the, accounts, relating, to, the, medes, reported, by, herodotus, left, the, image, of, a, powerful, people, who, would, have, formed, an, empire, at, the, beginning, of, the, 7th, century, bc, that, lasted, until, the, 550s, bc, played, a, determining, role, in, the, fall, of, the, assyrian, empire, and, competed, with, the, powerful, kingdoms, of, lydia, and, babylonia, however, a, recent, reassessment, of, contemporary, sources, from, the, median, period, has, altered, scholars, perceptions, of, the, median, state, the, state, remains, difficult, to, perceive, in, the, documentation, which, leaves, many, doubts, about, it, some, specialists, even, suggesting, that, there, never, was, a, powerful, median, kingdom, in, any, case, it, appears, that, after, the, fall, of, the, last, median, king, against, the, persian, king, cyrus, the, great, media, became, an, important, province, and, was, prized, by, the, empires, which, successively, dominated, it, achaemenids, seleucids, parthians, and, sasanids, the, original, source, for, their, name, and, homeland, is, a, directly, transmitted, old, iranian, geographical, name, which, is, attested, as, the, old, persian, m, da, singular, masculine, the, meaning, of, this, word, is, not, precisely, known, however, the, linguist, w, skalmowski, proposes, a, relation, with, the, proto, indo, european, word, med, h, meaning, central, suited, in, the, middle, by, referring, to, the, old, indic, madhya, and, old, iranian, maidiia, which, both, carry, the, same, meaning, the, latin, medium, greek, m, so, armenian, mej, and, english, mid, are, similarly, derived, from, it, greek, scholars, during, antiquity, would, base, ethnological, conclusions, on, greek, legends, and, the, similarity, of, names, according, to, the, histories, of, herodotus, 440, bc, the, medes, were, formerly, called, by, everyone, arians, but, when, the, colchian, woman, medea, came, from, athens, to, the, arians, they, changed, their, name, like, the, persians, this, is, the, medes, own, account, of, themselves, the, discoveries, of, median, sites, in, iran, happened, only, after, the, 1960s, prior, to, the, 1960s, the, search, for, median, archeological, sources, has, mostly, focused, in, an, area, known, as, the, median, triangle, defined, roughly, as, the, region, bounded, by, hamadan, and, malayer, in, hamadan, province, and, kangavar, in, kermanshah, province, three, major, sites, from, central, western, iran, in, the, iron, age, iii, period, i, e, 850, 500, bc, are, these, sources, have, both, similarities, in, cultural, characteristics, and, differences, due, to, functional, differences, and, diversity, among, the, median, tribes, the, architecture, of, these, archaeological, findings, which, can, probably, be, dated, to, the, median, period, show, a, link, between, the, tradition, of, columned, audience, halls, often, seen, in, the, achaemenid, empire, for, example, in, persepolis, and, safavid, iran, for, example, in, chehel, sotoun, from, the, 17th, century, ad, and, what, is, seen, in, median, architecture, the, materials, found, at, tepe, nush, i, jan, godin, tepe, and, other, sites, located, in, media, together, with, the, assyrian, reliefs, show, the, existence, of, urban, settlements, in, media, in, the, first, half, of, the, 1st, millennium, bc, which, had, functioned, as, centres, for, the, production, of, handicrafts, and, also, of, an, agricultural, and, cattle, breeding, economy, of, a, secondary, type, for, other, historical, documentation, the, archaeological, evidence, though, rare, together, with, cuneiform, records, by, assyrian, make, it, possible, regardless, of, herodotus, accounts, to, establish, some, of, the, early, history, of, medians, at, the, end, of, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, the, iranian, tribes, emerged, in, the, region, of, northwest, iran, these, tribes, expanded, their, control, over, larger, areas, iranian, tribes, were, present, in, western, and, northwestern, iran, from, at, least, the, 12th, or, 11th, centuries, bc, but, the, significance, of, iranian, elements, in, these, regions, were, established, from, the, beginning, of, the, second, half, of, the, 8th, century, bc, by, this, time, the, iranian, tribes, were, the, majority, in, what, later, become, the, territory, of, the, median, kingdom, and, also, the, west, of, media, proper, a, study, of, textual, sources, from, the, region, shows, that, in, the, neo, assyrian, period, the, regions, of, media, and, further, to, the, west, and, the, northwest, had, a, population, with, iranian, speaking, people, as, the, majority, in, western, and, northwestern, iran, and, in, areas, further, west, prior, to, median, rule, there, is, evidence, of, the, earlier, political, activity, of, the, powerful, societies, of, elam, mannaea, assyria, and, urartu, there, are, various, and, up, dated, opinions, on, the, positions, and, activities, of, iranian, tribes, in, these, societies, and, prior, to, the, major, iranian, state, formations, in, the, late, 7th, century, bc, one, opinion, of, herzfeld, et, al, is, that, the, ruling, class, were, iranian, migrants, but, the, society, was, autonomous, while, another, opinion, of, grantovsky, et, al, holds, that, both, the, ruling, class, and, basic, elements, of, the, population, were, iranian, the, medes, first, appear, on, the, historical, scene, in, the, 9th, century, bce, when, they, are, mentioned, in, contemporary, assyrian, texts, by, this, time, it, is, highly, likely, that, indo, iranian, speaking, peoples, had, already, settled, in, western, iran, at, least, some, 500, years, if, not, 1, 000, years, prior, to, this, period, most, scholars, believe, that, the, arrival, of, indo, iranian, speaking, populations, into, western, iran, was, not, the, result, of, one, mass, migration, but, instead, small, groups, of, nomadic, pastoralists, gradually, infiltrated, the, region, from, the, northeast, over, a, long, period, of, time, perhaps, dating, back, to, the, early, 2nd, millennium, bce, these, pastoralist, groups, gave, rise, to, diverse, cultural, and, linguistic, groups, with, one, such, group, eventually, coalescing, into, the, people, referred, to, by, the, assyrians, as, the, medes, from, the, 9th, century, bce, onwards, the, medes, were, well, established, in, western, iran, and, frequently, clashed, with, the, assyrians, their, powerful, neighbors, to, the, west, the, zagros, mountains, and, the, iranian, plateau, were, politically, fragmented, in, the, extreme, the, assyrian, sources, of, the, 8th, and, 7th, centuries, bce, tell, of, a, bewildering, number, of, kings, and, chieftains, who, ruled, areas, of, different, sizes, most, of, which, seem, to, have, been, very, small, in, referring, to, the, median, rulers, the, assyrian, texts, use, the, title, b, l, li, meaning, city, lord, a, term, for, petty, rulers, who, were, not, important, enough, to, be, called, kings, since, there, s, no, very, large, settlements, in, median, territory, b, l, li, is, sometimes, translated, as, chief, or, chieftain, from, the, assyrian, perspective, the, medes, were, a, strange, people, living, beyond, the, eastern, fringes, of, the, civilized, world, shalmaneser, iii, 858, 824, bc, was, the, first, assyrian, king, who, made, serious, efforts, to, extend, the, power, of, his, kingdom, beyond, the, reaches, of, northern, mesopotamia, and, he, was, the, first, assyrian, king, to, reach, the, iranian, plateau, although, his, army, operated, near, median, territories, in, 843, 827, and, 826, bce, the, medes, are, not, mentioned, in, the, reports, on, these, campaigns, only, once, in, 834, did, shalmaneser, sally, forth, from, parsua, in, order, to, attack, four, settlements, in, the, regions, of, messi, amadaya, arazia, and, harhar, among, these, amadaya, can, be, identified, as, media, shalmaneser, s, attack, was, however, a, mere, side, show, without, any, consequences, since, media, was, not, the, focus, of, shalmaneser, s, attention, the, assyrian, interest, in, the, iranian, highlands, probably, stemmed, from, their, need, for, horses, to, supply, the, chariots, and, cavalry, of, their, armed, forces, for, most, of, the, 9th, century, bce, the, assyrians, found, what, they, needed, in, the, zagros, mountains, in, areas, closer, to, the, assyrian, heartland, and, more, accessible, however, the, situation, changed, when, the, kingdom, of, urartu, expanded, into, the, areas, south, of, lake, urmia, thus, cutting, off, assyria, s, most, convenient, connection, with, central, iran, this, prompted, assyria, to, seek, new, and, more, reliable, access, routes, connecting, assyria, with, horse, breeding, areas, far, from, urartian, interference, this, attracted, assyria, s, attention, to, the, medes, renowned, for, their, wealth, of, horses, in, a, campaign, in, 819, or, 818, bce, shamshi, adad, v, 823, 811, bce, led, assyrian, forces, deep, into, western, iran, advancing, through, mesa, gilzilbunda, mataya, media, and, arazia, he, followed, the, path, previously, taken, by, shalmaneser, iii, in, 834, bce, during, this, expedition, assyrian, forces, encountered, and, fought, a, ruler, named, hana, iruka, in, media, according, to, shamshi, adad, s, inscriptions, they, purportedly, killed, 2, 300, of, hana, iruka, s, warriors, and, 140, cavalrymen, and, hana, iruka, s, royal, city, of, sagbita, was, destroyed, along, with, 1, 200, other, settlements, however, considering, later, campaigns, in, the, region, these, figures, seem, exaggerated, hana, iruka, fared, better, than, his, neighboring, rulers, the, king, of, gizilbunda, and, the, ruler, of, arazia, hana, iruka, not, only, survived, the, assault, but, also, did, not, submit, to, the, assyrian, king, and, apparently, had, no, booty, taken, from, his, land, while, only, a, fraction, of, the, median, territories, was, affected, by, shamshi, adad, s, incursion, this, marked, the, first, of, a, series, of, assyrian, attempts, to, exert, its, power, over, the, horse, breeders, of, western, iran, between, 810, and, 766, bce, at, least, seven, and, possibly, as, many, as, nine, assyrian, campaigns, were, directed, against, media, climaxing, in, the, years, 793, 787, bce, when, nergal, ila, i, the, commander, in, chief, of, adad, nirari, iii, 810, 783, bce, led, no, fewer, than, five, expeditions, east, ward, the, earliest, assyrian, incursions, into, the, zagros, region, seem, to, have, focused, mainly, on, plunder, it, is, only, under, the, king, tiglath, pileser, iii, 744, 727, bce, and, his, successors, that, the, assyrians, attempted, to, take, direct, control, of, median, territory, by, founding, new, assyrian, provinces, in, the, western, zagros, they, also, converted, some, median, towns, to, assyrian, centers, renaming, them, with, the, prefix, k, r, which, meant, harbor, or, trading, station, their, new, names, highlight, their, central, role, in, commerce, in, the, course, of, his, campaigns, tiglath, pileser, iii, established, two, new, provinces, expanding, the, permanent, assyrian, presence, much, further, onto, the, iranian, plateau, east, of, the, existing, assyrian, province, of, zamua, established, no, later, than, 843, bce, tiglath, pileser, founded, the, province, of, parsua, additionally, the, province, of, namri, likely, established, in, the, 790s, bce, now, shared, a, border, with, the, newly, created, province, of, bit, hamban, the, assyrian, overland, route, connecting, the, median, territories, with, the, mesopotamian, lowlands, now, reached, as, far, as, the, strategically, significant, city, of, harhar, on, the, iranian, plateau, in, 738, bce, tiglath, pileser, sent, an, army, detachment, against, the, mighty, medes, in, the, east, likely, in, the, region, beyond, mount, alvand, the, operation, was, successful, with, the, assyrians, capturing, the, settlement, of, mulugani, and, capturing, 5, 000, horses, people, oxen, sheep, and, goats, sargon, ii, 721, 705, bce, resumed, efforts, to, strengthen, the, assyrian, empire, s, grip, on, western, iran, even, further, this, renewed, advance, was, a, highly, concentrated, affair, accomplished, in, just, four, years, from, 716, to, 713, bce, during, which, time, the, median, lands, were, invaded, no, fewer, than, three, times, most, chiefs, who, paid, tribute, in, 714, bce, did, not, do, so, again, in, 713, bce, which, shows, that, even, when, the, assyrian, empire, s, involvement, with, the, median, territories, was, at, its, absolute, peak, only, a, small, fraction, of, the, median, chiefs, in, power, established, a, lasting, relationship, with, the, assyrian, conqueror, the, majority, anticipated, that, assyrian, forces, would, eventually, withdraw, as, they, had, done, in, the, past, however, the, establishment, of, fortresses, in, harhar, and, ki, esim, in, 716, bce, marked, a, turning, point, from, then, on, the, assyrians, maintained, a, permanent, presence, in, western, iran, however, the, effectiveness, of, assyrian, rule, was, still, limited, and, remained, weak, especially, in, areas, east, of, the, zagros, mountain, range, since, direct, control, over, the, medes, was, challenging, to, keep, deals, were, made, with, those, local, rulers, in, exchange, for, recognizing, the, assyrian, king, s, authority, providing, a, fixed, quantity, of, horses, as, tribute, and, fulfilling, other, obligations, cooperative, chiefs, received, the, protection, of, the, assyrian, empire, and, retained, the, freedom, to, govern, their, subjects, as, they, deemed, fit, this, compromise, usually, suited, both, sides, well, sargon, ii, undertook, another, expedition, to, media, in, 708, bce, but, was, unable, to, achieve, his, goal, of, conquering, all, median, lands, or, establishing, stable, control, over, them, subsequently, the, tribes, on, the, iranian, plateau, opposing, assyrian, dominance, consolidated, their, efforts, against, it, by, the, end, of, the, 8th, century, bce, the, first, major, unions, and, states, based, on, tribal, confederations, began, to, emerge, in, the, western, iranian, territory, led, by, local, chiefs, while, during, sargon, ii, s, reign, the, medes, seemed, contained, through, diplomacy, and, the, strategic, backing, of, competing, factions, by, the, time, of, his, grandson, esarhaddon, 680, 669, bce, the, assyrians, appeared, to, have, lost, ground, in, media, records, from, this, period, indicate, unrest, in, the, median, provinces, in, inquiries, directed, to, the, god, shamash, the, king, seeks, guidance, on, the, power, of, the, medes, and, their, allies, the, cimmerians, and, manneans, notably, the, b, l, li, of, karka, kashtariti, becomes, the, focus, of, the, king, s, concern, even, the, once, routine, collection, of, horse, tribute, from, the, medes, now, encounters, unexpected, difficulties, the, ad, tablets, record, the, oaths, made, by, eight, zagros, dwelling, b, l, l, ni, who, swore, loyalty, to, esarhaddon, and, his, crown, prince, ashurbanipal, 668, 631, bce, the, interpretation, of, these, oaths, has, been, a, subject, of, debate, ranging, from, vassal, treaties, to, the, swearing, in, of, a, corps, of, median, bodyguards, to, the, crown, prince, the, discovery, of, a, very, similar, tablet, from, the, syrian, site, of, tell, tayinat, points, to, an, empire, wide, attempt, at, making, all, allies, swear, allegiance, to, the, crown, prince, before, esarhaddon, s, death, six, years, prior, one, of, these, b, l, l, ni, ramataya, of, urakazabarna, had, visited, the, assyrian, court, he, brought, tribute, in, the, form, of, horses, and, lapis, lazuli, seeking, esarhaddon, s, assistance, against, rival, b, l, l, ni, however, it, appears, that, the, oaths, and, alliances, eventually, fell, apart, leading, to, the, tablets, that, documented, them, being, taken, from, the, temple, storage, room, and, crushed, while, by, the, mid, seventh, century, the, median, b, l, l, ni, seemed, poised, to, form, alliances, that, could, have, united, against, the, assyrians, there, is, no, indication, that, the, fundamental, political, structure, of, the, medes, as, independent, b, l, l, ni, was, undergoing, significant, changes, as, herodotus, s, story, of, deioces, s, rise, would, suggest, the, last, mention, of, median, b, l, l, ni, comes, from, an, inscription, of, ashurbanipal, that, recounts, a, campaign, of, 656, bce, in, which, three, median, b, l, l, ni, rebelled, and, were, captured, and, brought, back, to, nineveh, as, it, became, conceivable, for, a, united, media, to, defeat, assyria, and, assume, her, mantle, of, power, in, the, region, the, impetus, to, unite, may, have, been, stronger, than, the, competitive, forces, dividing, the, b, l, l, ni, after, 670, bce, susceptible, to, scythian, and, cimmerian, raids, and, facing, the, decline, of, trade, along, the, great, khorasan, road, many, median, chiefdoms, probably, collapsed, leaving, fewer, chiefs, to, compete, for, power, the, states, of, non, iranian, peoples, like, the, manneans, elippians, and, kassites, probably, collapsed, as, well, which, allowed, median, groups, to, take, over, their, territory, with, fewer, chiefs, remaining, one, of, them, might, have, risen, to, the, position, of, paramount, chief, subjugating, his, former, equals, cyaxares, probably, rose, to, prominence, in, this, context, he, may, indeed, have, fought, the, scythians, as, herodotus, claims, which, may, have, earned, him, his, reputation, as, a, great, warrior, through, his, victories, cyaxares, gained, more, and, more, influence, eventually, uniting, the, medes, and, other, peoples, under, his, leadership, from, the, 10th, to, the, late, 7th, centuries, bce, the, western, parts, of, media, fell, under, the, domination, of, the, vast, neo, assyrian, empire, which, stretched, from, cyprus, in, the, west, to, parts, of, western, iran, in, the, east, and, egypt, and, the, north, of, the, arabian, peninsula, during, the, reign, of, sinsharishkun, 622, 612, bce, the, assyrian, empire, which, had, been, in, a, state, of, constant, civil, war, since, 626, bce, began, to, unravel, subject, peoples, such, as, the, babylonians, egyptians, scythians, cimmerians, and, arameans, quietly, ceased, to, pay, tribute, to, assyria, assyrian, dominance, over, the, medes, came, to, an, end, during, the, reign, of, median, king, cyaxares, who, in, alliance, with, the, babylonian, king, nabopolassar, attacked, and, destroyed, the, strife, riven, neo, assyrian, empire, between, 616, and, 609, bce, after, the, fall, of, assyria, a, unified, median, state, became, one, of, the, four, major, powers, of, the, ancient, near, east, together, with, babylonia, lydia, and, egypt, the, medes, were, subsequently, able, to, expand, beyond, their, original, homeland, and, had, eventually, a, territory, stretching, roughly, from, northeastern, iran, to, the, k, z, l, rmak, river, in, anatolia, cyaxares, was, succeeded, by, his, son, astyages, in, 553, bce, cyrus, the, great, the, king, of, persia, a, median, vassal, revolted, against, the, median, king, in, 550, bce, cyrus, finally, won, a, decisive, victory, resulting, in, astyages, capture, by, his, own, dissatisfied, nobles, who, promptly, turned, him, over, to, the, triumphant, cyrus, in, herodotus, i, 95, 130, deioces, is, introduced, as, the, founder, of, a, centralized, median, state, he, had, been, known, to, the, median, people, as, a, just, and, incorruptible, man, and, when, asked, by, the, median, people, to, solve, their, possible, disputes, he, agreed, and, put, forward, the, condition, that, they, make, him, king, and, build, a, great, city, at, ecbatana, as, the, capital, of, the, median, state, judging, from, the, contemporary, sources, of, the, region, and, disregarding, the, account, of, herodotus, puts, the, formation, of, a, unified, median, state, during, the, reign, of, cyaxares, or, later, the, list, of, median, rulers, and, their, period, of, reign, is, compiled, according, to, two, sources, firstly, herodotus, who, calls, them, kings, and, associates, them, with, the, same, family, secondly, the, babylonian, chronicle, which, in, gadd, s, chronicle, on, the, fall, of, nineveh, gives, its, own, list, a, combined, list, stretching, over, 150, years, is, thus, however, not, all, of, these, dates, and, personalities, given, by, herodotus, match, the, other, near, eastern, sources, after, cyrus, s, victory, against, astyages, the, medes, were, subjected, to, their, close, kin, the, persians, in, the, new, empire, they, retained, a, prominent, position, in, honour, and, war, they, stood, next, to, the, persians, their, court, ceremony, was, adopted, by, the, new, sovereigns, who, in, the, summer, months, resided, in, ecbatana, and, many, noble, medes, were, employed, as, officials, satraps, and, generals, in, later, periods, medes, and, especially, mede, soldiers, are, identified, and, portrayed, prominently, in, ancient, archaeological, sites, such, as, persepolis, where, they, are, shown, to, have, a, major, role, and, presence, in, the, military, of, the, achaemenid, empire, the, almost, complete, lack, of, written, material, makes, it, difficult, to, know, how, the, medes, conceived, their, society, according, to, herodotus, persian, society, during, the, reign, of, cyrus, the, great, was, composed, of, numerous, tribes, g, nea, and, each, tribe, was, divided, into, clans, phr, tr, a, this, general, outline, by, the, greek, historian, reflects, the, concept, that, the, social, groups, individuals, belonged, to, were, family, clan, tribe, and, country, although, clan, affiliations, or, tribal, connections, of, significant, individuals, are, rarely, mentioned, in, achaemenid, period, texts, the, persians, still, identified, themselves, through, their, relationships, with, family, paternal, name, clan, and, tribe, it, is, quite, likely, that, the, medes, did, the, same, as, according, to, herodotus, their, nation, was, also, composed, of, tribes, g, n, a, assyrian, inscriptions, use, the, unusual, term, b, l, li, for, the, median, leaders, a, term, that, is, occasionally, applied, also, to, other, rulers, of, polities, in, the, zagros, mountains, but, otherwise, unknown, in, the, assyrian, records, literally, translated, the, term, means, head, of, a, city, but, it, has, been, variously, translated, as, chieftain, city, leader, or, city, lord, the, term, as, used, by, the, assyrians, is, probably, also, a, reflection, of, their, own, interpretation, of, a, power, structure, that, was, unfamiliar, to, them, and, could, only, be, rendered, in, terms, that, the, assyrians, themselves, understood, it, is, clear, from, assyrian, sources, that, the, position, of, b, l, li, could, be, hereditary, the, assyrian, sources, do, not, provide, any, information, about, the, organizational, structure, above, the, level, of, chieftains, and, the, inner, structure, of, these, median, chiefdoms, remain, largely, unknown, according, to, herodotus, the, medes, were, divided, into, six, tribes, busai, paretakenians, struchates, arizantians, budians, and, magians, the, name, of, these, tribes, appear, to, be, completely, unknown, to, the, assyrians, despite, centuries, of, direct, contact, with, various, median, groups, only, the, name, of, herodotus, s, paretakenians, sounds, similar, to, the, lands, of, partakka, and, partukka, whose, chieftains, sought, help, from, the, assyrian, king, esarhaddon, 680, 669, bc, if, any, tribal, structures, existed, from, the, 9th, to, the, 7th, century, bc, their, political, significance, was, likely, minimal, contrary, to, expectations, the, medes, internal, rivalries, did, not, result, in, the, concentration, of, land, wealth, and, power, in, the, hands, of, a, steadily, decreasing, number, of, chieftains, over, time, the, opposite, occurred, in, 819, bc, a, small, number, of, median, chiefs, fielded, considerably, stronger, forces, against, assyria, than, their, more, numerous, descendants, did, in, the, later, half, of, the, 8th, century, bc, when, they, were, attacked, by, tiglath, pileser, iii, and, sargon, ii, this, suggests, that, sons, of, chieftains, had, equal, inheritance, rights, leading, to, the, division, of, their, father, s, lands, increasing, the, number, of, chiefdoms, and, accelerating, media, s, political, fragmentation, sargon, ii, s, inscriptions, alone, identify, at, least, 55, median, chiefdoms, and, considering, that, there, were, likely, additional, less, important, chiefdoms, not, mentioned, in, assyrian, records, the, total, number, could, have, been, close, to, a, hundred, or, even, more, presumably, the, tribal, union, of, the, medes, was, not, merely, nominal, it, is, to, this, union, that, the, medes, must, have, owed, at, times, the, possibility, of, collective, action, with, a, choice, of, capable, leaders, but, such, unity, could, manifest, itself, only, occasionally, in, the, majority, of, the, cases, the, medes, in, spite, of, their, strength, were, divided, the, six, median, tribes, resided, in, media, proper, the, triangular, area, between, rhagae, aspadana, and, ecbatana, in, present, day, iran, that, is, the, area, between, tehran, isfahan, and, hamadan, respectively, of, the, median, tribes, the, magi, resided, in, rhagae, modern, tehran, they, were, of, a, sacred, caste, which, ministered, to, the, spiritual, needs, of, the, medes, the, paretaceni, tribe, resided, in, and, around, aspadana, modern, isfahan, the, arizanti, lived, in, and, around, kashan, isfahan, province, and, the, busae, tribe, lived, in, and, around, the, future, median, capital, of, ecbatana, near, modern, hamadan, the, struchates, and, the, budii, lived, in, villages, in, the, median, triangle, the, family, life, of, the, medes, was, based, on, patriarchal, authority, and, polygamy, was, permitted, strabo, geogr, xi, 13, 11, mentions, a, peculiar, law, applied, to, all, medes, a, law, requiring, every, man, to, have, no, fewer, than, five, wives, it, is, very, unlikely, that, such, a, burden, would, actually, be, obligatory, on, anyone, most, likely, only, five, lawful, wives, and, no, more, were, permitted, by, the, aforementioned, law, just, as, four, wives, and, no, more, are, legal, for, muslims, the, medes, had, cities, probably, small, fortified, settlements, like, those, identified, archaeologically, these, locations, were, characterized, by, fortifications, warehouses, worship, buildings, and, ceremonial, structures, the, common, population, did, not, reside, within, these, places, nor, necessarily, in, immediate, proximity, it, is, presumed, they, inhabited, small, villages, or, pastoral, camps, the, medes, are, portrayed, in, the, reliefs, of, persepolis, dating, back, to, 515, bce, just, 35, years, after, the, fall, of, the, median, kingdom, the, reliefs, depicting, the, medes, appear, in, three, locations, showing, guards, nobles, and, their, delegations, the, reason, for, their, frequent, representation, lies, in, the, fact, that, the, medes, held, a, privileged, status, in, the, achaemenid, empire, the, first, relief, shows, four, medes, and, persian, spearmen, in, this, relief, the, medes, wear, short, coats, trousers, and, round, caps, under, which, they, seem, to, have, curly, hair, information, about, the, religion, of, the, medes, is, very, limited, primary, sources, pointing, to, religious, affiliations, of, medes, found, so, far, include, the, archaeological, discoveries, in, tepe, nush, i, jan, personal, names, of, median, individuals, and, the, histories, of, herodotus, between, 1967, and, 1977, david, stronach, excavated, a, building, at, tepe, nush, i, jan, that, had, been, built, around, 750, bc, and, appears, to, be, mainly, religious, in, character, the, building, was, erected, on, a, rock, about, 30, meters, high, and, included, a, central, sanctuary, western, sanctuary, fortress, and, columned, hall, which, were, surrounded, by, a, circular, brick, support, wall, the, central, sanctuary, was, tower, shaped, with, a, triangular, inner, altar, its, space, is, 11, 7, meters, and, the, walls, are, eight, meters, high, near, the, west, corner, of, the, altar, a, stepped, fire, altar, constructed, of, mud, bricks, was, discovered, as, is, known, the, cult, of, fire, was, a, common, indo, iranian, legacy, according, to, herodotus, the, medes, had, a, priestly, caste, called, the, magi, who, were, one, of, the, tribes, of, this, people, they, had, the, right, or, privilege, to, serve, as, priests, not, only, for, the, medes, but, also, for, the, persians, thus, they, constituted, a, priestly, caste, that, passed, its, functions, from, father, to, son, they, played, a, significant, role, in, the, court, of, the, median, king, astyages, serving, as, advisers, sorcerers, dream, interpreters, and, soothsayers, classical, authors, regarded, the, magi, as, zoroastrian, priests, from, the, personal, names, of, medes, as, recorded, by, assyrian, texts, from, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, bce, there, are, examples, of, the, use, of, the, indo, iranian, word, arta, lit, truth, or, theophoric, names, with, ma, dakku, and, even, the, name, of, the, god, ahura, mazda, which, is, familiar, from, both, avestan, and, old, persian, the, religion, promoted, by, the, magi, could, be, some, form, of, pre, zoroastrianism, or, zoroastrianism, itself, this, is, a, controversial, topic, on, which, scholars, have, not, yet, reached, a, consensus, igor, diakonoff, supposed, that, astyages, and, perhaps, even, cyaxares, had, already, adopted, a, religion, derived, from, the, teachings, of, zoroaster, although, not, necessarily, identical, with, his, doctrine, mary, boyce, argued, that, the, existence, of, the, magi, in, media, with, their, own, traditions, and, forms, of, worship, was, an, obstacle, to, zoroastrian, proselytism, there, boyce, wrote, that, the, zoroastrian, traditions, in, the, median, city, of, ray, probably, goes, back, to, the, 8th, century, bce, it, is, suggested, that, from, the, 8th, century, bce, a, form, of, mazdaism, with, common, iranian, traditions, existed, in, media, and, the, strict, reforms, of, zarathustra, began, to, spread, in, western, iran, during, the, reign, of, the, last, median, kings, in, the, 6th, century, bce, it, is, also, possible, that, the, medes, may, have, practised, mithraism, with, mithra, as, their, supreme, deity, median, people, spoke, the, median, language, which, was, an, old, iranian, language, strabo, s, geographica, finished, in, the, early, first, century, mentions, the, affinity, of, median, with, other, iranian, languages, the, name, of, ariana, is, further, extended, to, a, part, of, persia, and, of, media, as, also, to, the, bactrians, and, sogdians, on, the, north, for, these, speak, approximately, the, same, language, but, with, slight, variations, no, original, deciphered, text, has, been, proven, to, have, been, written, in, the, median, language, it, is, suggested, that, similar, to, the, later, iranian, practice, of, keeping, archives, of, written, documents, in, achaemenid, iran, there, was, also, a, maintenance, of, archives, by, the, median, government, in, their, capital, ecbatana, there, are, examples, of, median, literature, found, in, later, records, one, is, according, to, herodotus, that, the, median, king, deioces, appearing, as, a, judge, made, judgement, on, causes, submitted, in, writing, there, is, also, a, report, by, dinon, on, the, existence, of, median, court, poets, median, literature, is, part, of, the, old, iranian, literature, including, also, saka, old, persian, avestan, as, this, iranian, affiliation, of, them, is, explicit, also, in, ancient, texts, such, as, herodotus, s, account, that, many, peoples, including, medes, were, universally, called, iranian, no, documents, dated, from, the, median, period, have, been, preserved, only, one, bronze, plate, dating, from, the, pre, achaemenid, period, has, been, found, in, median, territory, bearing, a, cuneiform, inscription, in, akkadian, dating, back, to, the, 8th, century, bce, but, it, does, not, mention, any, median, names, a, cuneiform, inscription, on, a, piece, of, silver, was, excavated, at, tepe, nush, i, jan, but, only, the, end, of, one, sign, and, the, beginning, of, the, next, were, preserved, if, writing, was, employed, by, the, medes, it, likely, utilized, a, script, similar, to, aramaic, that, was, written, on, perishable, materials, since, no, historical, accounts, literary, texts, bureaucratic, records, or, even, commercial, transaction, records, survived, some, small, elements, of, the, median, language, have, been, reconstructed, from, place, names, personal, names, and, some, suggested, median, linguistic, remnants, in, old, persian, numerous, non, persian, words, in, old, persian, texts, are, commonly, assumed, to, be, median, and, other, median, forms, are, preserved, in, akkadian, versions, of, achaemenid, inscriptions, and, elsewhere, the, median, words, in, old, persian, texts, whose, median, origin, can, be, established, by, phonetic, criteria, appear, more, frequently, among, royal, titles, and, among, terms, of, the, chancellery, military, and, judicial, affairs, according, to, r, diger, schmitt, it, s, likely, that, the, median, language, differed, only, dialectically, from, old, persian, very, little, remains, of, the, material, culture, of, the, medes, and, it, is, challenging, to, confidently, attribute, artifacts, from, the, period, before, the, persian, empire, to, the, medes, specifically, or, to, other, groups, residing, in, western, iran, during, the, iron, age, for, this, reason, median, art, remains, a, purely, speculative, topic, and, its, existence, is, even, denied, by, some, scholars, g, za, de, francovitch, noted, that, there, is, not, a, single, work, conclusively, of, median, origin, in, the, archaeological, record, this, observation, appears, to, remain, relevant, even, after, the, excavation, of, two, seemingly, median, sites, in, western, iran, and, the, emergence, of, more, academic, writings, claiming, to, have, unraveled, and, understood, the, characteristics, of, median, art, still, other, scholars, presume, that, archaeological, sites, such, as, tepe, nush, i, jan, and, godin, tepe, located, in, media, and, dating, back, to, the, 8th, and, 7th, centuries, bce, are, examples, supporting, the, existence, of, median, art, although, tepe, nush, i, jan, was, not, a, capital, according, to, david, stronach, it, became, a, crucial, link, in, a, chain, of, evidence, regarding, the, composition, and, development, of, median, architecture, as, well, as, the, incorporation, of, median, culture, into, ancient, eastern, civilizations, influence, and, direct, borrowing, of, fine, details, entire, architectural, forms, and, building, design, that, had, precise, analogs, in, assyrian, and, urartian, art, can, be, traced, in, the, architecture, of, tepe, nus, i, j, and, godin, tepe, the, medes, not, only, borrowed, some, elements, from, foreign, art, but, also, used, them, in, new, contexts, with, new, functions, and, meanings, that, is, in, a, new, context, without, their, typical, and, initial, qualities, later, the, achaemenids, borrowed, cultural, achievements, from, the, ancient, near, east, through, the, medes, j, curtis, argues, against, the, minimalist, position, that, there, is, nothing, readily, identifiable, as, median, art, but, rather, asserts, that, those, objects, that, may, be, characterized, as, median, were, heavily, influenced, by, assyrian, art, objects, in, a, style, halfway, assyrian, halfway, achaemenid, are, often, attributed, to, median, art, herodotus, provides, a, description, of, the, palace, of, deioces, in, ecbatana, stating, that, it, was, an, architectural, complex, built, on, a, hill, and, surrounded, by, seven, concentric, walls, with, each, battlement, of, a, wall, surpassing, that, of, the, wall, next, outside, it, the, palace, itself, and, the, royal, treasures, were, located, within, the, innermost, circle, the, battlements, of, these, circles, would, have, been, painted, with, seven, different, colors, indicating, that, the, medes, developed, a, rich, polychrome, and, the, two, innermost, circles, were, covered, with, silver, and, gold, respectively, the, artistic, contributions, of, median, goldsmiths, are, also, mentioned, in, persian, records, pictorial, art, has, been, excavated, in, small, quantities, and, of, somewhat, disappointing, quality, so, far, evidence, shows, that, median, pictorial, art, was, heavily, influenced, by, the, babylonians, assyrians, elamites, and, perhaps, the, early, phase, of, the, animal, style, of, the, ancient, near, east, in, hamadan, a, bronze, plate, was, discovered, with, the, inscription, of, a, king, of, abadana, a, small, kingdom, west, of, assyrian, outposts, the, plate, depicts, the, king, dressed, similarly, to, babylonian, attire, from, the, late, kassite, period, another, inscribed, object, is, a, cylinder, seal, with, a, hero, fighting, a, monster, the, scene, and, inscription, style, related, to, the, elamite, style, in, susa, but, the, hero, s, headdress, is, typical, of, the, medes, in, achaemenid, palace, reliefs, other, findings, include, a, crude, style, cylinder, seal, impression, from, nush, i, jan, and, cylinder, seals, in, various, mesopotamian, styles, from, the, ruins, and, vicinity, of, hamadan, some, dating, back, to, the, 8th, and, 7th, centuries, bce, these, findings, reveal, a, strong, influence, from, other, civilizations, but, lack, distinctive, traits, of, authentic, median, art, local, craftsmanship, is, indicated, by, excavated, bronze, jars, architectural, painting, attested, in, both, baba, jan, and, nush, i, jan, can, be, compared, to, the, not, so, sophisticated, geometric, style, found, in, tepe, sialk, r, d, barnett, argued, that, the, so, called, scythian, style, more, precisely, the, earliest, phase, of, this, style, was, also, part, of, contemporary, median, art, late, 8th, century, bce, however, this, theory, has, not, been, proven, or, refuted, so, far, a, passage, from, the, babylonian, chronicle, records, that, after, the, conquest, of, ecbatana, cyrus, took, the, silver, gold, goods, and, properties, of, the, city, to, persia, while, the, exact, nature, of, these, precious, metals, and, goods, is, not, specified, except, for, being, portable, material, it, is, possible, that, median, artisanal, objects, as, well, as, state, or, religious, items, were, among, the, spoils, greek, references, to, median, people, make, no, clear, distinction, between, the, persians, and, the, medians, in, fact, for, a, greek, to, become, too, closely, associated, with, iranian, culture, was, to, become, medianized, not, persianized, the, median, kingdom, was, a, short, lived, iranian, state, and, the, textual, and, archaeological, sources, of, that, period, are, rare, and, little, could, be, known, from, the, median, culture, the, basic, economic, resource, in, the, region, was, pastoralism, as, indicated, in, the, records, of, assyrian, raids, and, tributes, a, primary, factor, for, economic, development, was, the, breeding, of, valuable, breeds, such, as, horses, for, military, use, and, bactrian, camels, for, commercial, transport, the, proximity, to, the, assyrian, empire, as, well, as, to, urartu, elam, and, babylon, made, the, breeding, of, these, animals, highly, profitable, however, the, most, crucial, economic, factor, was, the, strategic, location, of, the, medes, along, the, main, trade, route, the, silk, road, connecting, mesopotamia, to, central, asia, assyrian, palace, reliefs, depict, inhabitants, of, the, eastern, mountain, regions, wearing, the, same, tunics, sheepskin, coats, lace, up, boot, and, hairstyles, this, visual, evidence, suggests, a, similarity, in, the, lifeways, of, the, western, iranian, peoples, with, no, apparent, significant, distinctions, among, the, medes, and, their, neighbors, the, only, direct, references, to, the, median, lifestyle, occur, in, a, literary, text, from, the, 7th, century, bce, known, as, the, sargon, geography, mentioning, one, median, chiefdom, karzinu, reached, by, assyrian, forces, in, 716, bce, as, usual, non, mesopotamian, foreigners, are, characterized, negatively, by, listing, the, assyrian, cultural, elements, that, the, foreigners, supposedly, lacked, the, description, of, the, people, of, karzinu, makes, it, clear, that, they, differed, in, quite, a, number, of, respects, including, hairstyle, funerary, practices, and, diet, from, the, cultural, habits, of, the, western, parts, of, the, assyrian, empire, median, livestock, breeders, probably, practiced, transhumance, inhabiting, their, settlements, in, winter, and, spending, the, summer, on, pastures, high, in, the, mountains, the, information, gleaned, from, the, sargon, campaign, provides, a, rare, reference, to, median, farming, suggesting, a, robust, rural, economy, combining, livestock, breeding, and, farming, albeit, lacking, notable, crafts, or, industries, worth, mentioning, the, degree, to, which, the, medes, participated, in, the, trade, that, passed, through, their, territories, between, mesopotamia, and, the, lands, further, east, is, unknown, assyrians, received, various, goods, from, the, medes, including, horses, mules, bactrian, camels, oxen, sheep, and, goats, however, there, is, an, absence, of, sophisticated, finished, products, like, precious, textiles, metalwork, or, furniture, and, no, luxury, goods, except, for, lapis, lazuli, the, medes, were, defined, by, their, life, in, the, zagros, mountains, they, sowed, grain, in, the, broad, valleys, and, pastured, their, animals, on, the, hillsides, moving, from, summer, to, winter, pastures, as, the, weather, demanded, the, medes, raised, sheep, goat, and, cattle, for, meat, milk, and, wool, but, it, was, the, median, horses, that, were, considered, their, most, treasured, resource, the, medes, were, known, for, their, horsemanship, and, when, the, assyrians, demanded, tribute, from, them, it, was, almost, always, in, the, form, of, horses, trained, for, riding, in, the, greek, myth, of, jason, and, the, argonauts, medea, is, the, daughter, of, king, ae, tes, of, colchis, and, a, paternal, granddaughter, of, the, sun, god, helios, following, her, failed, marriage, to, jason, while, in, corinth, for, one, of, several, reasons, depending, on, the, version, she, marries, king, aegeus, of, athens, and, bears, a, son, medus, after, failing, to, make, aegeus, kill, his, older, son, theseus, she, and, her, son, fled, to, aria, where, the, medes, take, their, name, from, her, according, to, several, greek, and, later, roman, accounts, including, in, pausanias, description, of, greece, 1st, century, ad, according, to, other, versions, such, as, in, strabo, s, geographica, 1st, century, ad, and, justin, s, epitoma, historiarum, philippicarum, 2nd, or, 3rd, century, ad, she, returned, home, to, conquer, neighboring, lands, with, her, husband, jason, one, of, which, was, named, after, her, while, another, version, related, by, diodorus, siculus, in, bibliotheca, historica, 1st, century, bc, states, that, after, being, exiled, she, married, an, asian, king, and, bore, medus, who, was, greatly, admired, for, his, courage, after, whom, they, took, their, name, russian, historian, and, linguist, vladimir, minorsky, suggested, that, the, medes, who, widely, inhabited, the, land, where, currently, the, kurds, form, a, majority, might, have, been, forefathers, of, the, modern, kurds, he, also, states, that, the, medes, who, invaded, the, region, in, the, eighth, century, bc, linguistically, resembled, the, kurds, this, view, was, accepted, by, many, kurdish, nationalists, in, the, twentieth, century, however, martin, van, bruinessen, a, dutch, scholar, argues, against, the, attempt, to, take, the, medes, as, ancestors, of, the, kurds, though, some, kurdish, intellectuals, claim, that, their, people, are, descended, from, the, medes, there, is, no, evidence, to, permit, such, a, connection, across, the, considerable, gap, in, time, between, the, political, dominance, of, the, medes, and, the, first, attestation, of, the, kurds, contemporary, linguistic, evidence, has, challenged, the, previously, suggested, view, that, the, kurds, are, descendants, of, the, medes, gernot, ludwig, windfuhr, professor, of, iranian, studies, identified, the, kurdish, languages, as, parthian, albeit, with, a, median, substratum, david, neil, mackenzie, an, authority, on, the, kurdish, language, said, kurdish, was, closer, to, persian, and, questioned, the, traditional, view, holding, that, kurdish, because, of, its, differences, from, persian, should, be, regarded, as, a, northwestern, iranian, language, the, kurdologist, and, iranologist, garnik, asatrian, stated, that, the, central, iranian, dialects, and, primarily, those, of, the, kashan, area, in, the, first, place, as, well, as, the, azari, dialects, otherwise, called, southern, tati, are, probably, the, only, iranian, dialects, which, can, pretend, to, be, the, direct, offshoots, of, median, in, general, the, relationship, between, kurdish, and, median, is, not, closer, than, the, affinities, between, the, latter, and, other, north, western, dialects, baluchi, talishi, south, caspian, zaza, gurani, kurdish, soran, kurmanc, kelhor, asatrian, also, stated, that, there, is, no, serious, ground, to, suggest, a, special, genetic, affinity, within, north, western, iranian, between, this, ancient, language, and, kurdish, the, latter, does, not, share, even, the, generally, ephemeric, peculiarity, of, median, according, to, shahbazi, the, medes, were, ancestors, of, many, iranians, particularly, the, kurds, to, jwaideh, the, empire, of, the, medes, one, of, the, reputed, ancestors, of, the, kurdish, people, was, the, only, great, national, state, that, may, be, said, to, have, been, established, by, the, kurds, according, to, the, cambridge, history, of, the, kurds, although, some, kurdish, authors, have, claimed, descendants, for, kurdish, from, avestan, and, median, a, direct, link, of, kurdish, with, avestan, was, ruled, out, in, iranian, philology, even, back, in, its, initial, stages, cf, r, diger, and, pott, 1842, cited, in, lecoq, 1997, 31, while, avestan, although, its, classification, is, also, unresolved, is, traditionally, considered, to, be, closer, to, eastern, iranian, languages, cf, korn, 2016, 403, furthermore, the, purported, relationship, of, kurdish, to, the, median, language, although, defended, by, minorsky, based, mostly, on, conjectural, historical, evidence, minorsky, 1940, 143, 6, is, not, supported, by, linguistic, evidence, since, information, about, the, median, language, is, extremely, limited, and, indirect, being, mostly, restricted, to, the, loanwords, found, in, the, old, persian, inscriptions, lecoq, 1987, 674, 4, as, lecoq, 1997, 31, states, in, relation, to, the, kurdish, median, connection, everything, is, possible, but, nothing, is, demonstrable, but, even, the, limited, data, at, hand, provide, evidence, against, kurdish, median, genetic, affinity, asatrian, 2009, 21, mackenzie, 1999, 675, 6, rossi, 2010, 308, refuting, thus, the, median, origin, of, kurdish, mackenzie, 1961, outlined, a, picture, of, the, evolution, of, north, western, iranian, languages, where, kurdish, and, persian, evolved, in, parallel, and, therefore, kurdish, represented, an, early, splitting, from, the, linguistic, subgroup, of, median, cf, rossi, 2010, 307, 8, likewise, in, his, survey, of, major, isoglosses, in, the, historical, phonology, of, west, iranian, languages, windfuhr, 1975, 458, concluded, on, the, basis, of, these, facts, and, with, regard, to, the, subsequent, migration, of, the, kurds, into, the, median, territory, explained, below, that, kurdish, can, probably, not, be, considered, a, median, dialect, neither, linguistically, nor, geographically, stating, further, that, the, modern, iranian, languages, of, azerbaijan, originally, aturpatakan, and, central, iran, e, g, sivandi, are, median, dialects, windfuhr, 2009, 15
