to, hegemony, over, the, entire, mediterranean, world, roman, society, at, the, time, was, primarily, a, cultural, mix, of, latin, and, etruscan, societies, as, well, as, of, sabine, oscan, and, greek, cultural, elements, which, is, especially, visible, in, the, ancient, roman, religion, and, its, pantheon, its, political, organization, developed, at, around, the, same, time, as, direct, democracy, in, ancient, greece, with, collective, and, annual, magistracies, overseen, by, a, senate, there, were, annual, elections, but, the, republican, system, was, an, elective, oligarchy, not, a, democracy, a, small, number, of, powerful, families, largely, monopolised, the, magistracies, roman, institutions, underwent, considerable, changes, throughout, the, republic, to, adapt, to, the, difficulties, it, faced, such, as, the, creation, of, promagistracies, to, rule, its, conquered, provinces, or, the, composition, of, the, senate, unlike, the, pax, romana, of, the, roman, empire, throughout, the, republican, era, rome, was, in, a, state, of, quasi, perpetual, war, its, first, enemies, were, its, latin, and, etruscan, neighbours, as, well, as, the, gauls, who, sacked, rome, in, 387, bc, after, the, gallic, sack, rome, conquered, the, whole, italian, peninsula, in, a, century, and, thus, became, a, major, power, in, the, mediterranean, its, greatest, strategic, rival, was, carthage, against, which, it, waged, three, wars, rome, defeated, carthage, at, the, battle, of, zama, in, 202, bc, becoming, the, dominant, power, of, the, ancient, mediterranean, world, it, then, embarked, on, a, long, series, of, difficult, conquests, defeating, philip, v, and, perseus, of, macedon, antiochus, iii, of, the, seleucid, empire, the, lusitanian, viriathus, the, numidian, jugurtha, the, pontic, king, mithridates, vi, vercingetorix, of, the, arverni, tribe, of, gaul, and, the, egyptian, queen, cleopatra, at, home, during, the, conflict, of, the, orders, the, patricians, the, closed, oligarchic, elite, came, into, conflict, with, the, more, numerous, plebs, this, was, resolved, peacefully, with, the, plebs, achieving, political, equality, by, the, 4th, century, bc, the, late, republic, from, 133, bc, onward, saw, substantial, domestic, strife, often, anachronistically, seen, as, a, conflict, between, optimates, and, populares, referring, to, conservative, and, reformist, politicians, respectively, the, social, war, between, rome, and, its, italian, allies, over, citizenship, and, roman, hegemony, in, italy, greatly, expanded, the, scope, of, civil, violence, mass, slavery, also, contributed, to, three, servile, wars, tensions, at, home, coupled, with, ambitions, abroad, led, to, further, civil, wars, the, first, involved, marius, and, sulla, after, a, generation, the, republic, fell, into, civil, war, again, in, 49, bc, between, julius, caesar, and, pompey, despite, his, victory, and, appointment, as, dictator, for, life, caesar, was, assassinated, in, 44, bc, caesar, s, heir, octavian, and, lieutenant, mark, antony, defeated, caesar, s, assassins, in, 42, bc, but, they, eventually, split, antony, s, defeat, alongside, his, ally, and, lover, cleopatra, at, the, battle, of, actium, in, 31, bc, and, the, senate, s, grant, of, extraordinary, powers, to, octavian, as, augustus, in, 27, bc, which, effectively, made, him, the, first, roman, emperor, marked, the, end, of, the, republic, rome, had, been, ruled, by, monarchs, since, its, foundation, these, monarchs, were, elected, for, life, by, the, men, of, the, roman, senate, the, last, roman, monarch, was, called, tarquin, the, proud, who, in, traditional, histories, was, expelled, from, rome, in, 509, bc, because, his, son, sextus, tarquinius, raped, a, noblewoman, lucretia, the, tradition, asserted, that, the, monarchy, was, abolished, in, a, revolution, led, by, the, semi, mythical, lucius, junius, brutus, and, the, king, s, powers, were, then, transferred, to, two, separate, consuls, elected, to, office, for, a, term, of, one, year, each, was, capable, of, checking, his, colleague, by, veto, most, modern, scholarship, describes, these, accounts, as, the, quasi, mythological, detailing, of, an, aristocratic, coup, within, tarquin, s, own, family, or, a, consequence, of, an, etruscan, occupation, of, rome, rather, than, a, popular, revolution, according, to, rome, s, traditional, histories, tarquin, made, several, attempts, to, retake, the, throne, including, the, tarquinian, conspiracy, which, involved, brutus, s, own, sons, the, war, with, veii, and, tarquinii, and, finally, the, war, between, rome, and, clusium, the, attempts, to, restore, the, monarchy, did, not, succeed, the, first, roman, republican, wars, were, wars, of, expansion, one, by, one, rome, defeated, both, the, persistent, sabines, and, the, local, cities, rome, defeated, its, rival, latin, cities, in, the, battle, of, lake, regillus, in, 496, bc, the, battle, of, ariccia, in, 495, bc, the, battle, of, mount, algidus, in, 458, bc, and, the, battle, of, corbio, in, 446, bc, but, it, suffered, a, significant, defeat, at, the, battle, of, the, cremera, in, 477, bc, wherein, it, fought, against, the, most, important, etruscan, city, veii, this, defeat, was, later, avenged, at, the, battle, of, veii, in, 396, bc, wherein, rome, destroyed, the, city, by, the, end, of, this, period, rome, had, effectively, completed, the, conquest, of, its, immediate, etruscan, and, latin, neighbours, and, secured, its, position, against, the, immediate, threat, posed, by, the, nearby, apennine, hill, tribes, beginning, with, their, revolt, against, tarquin, and, continuing, through, the, early, years, of, the, republic, rome, s, patrician, aristocrats, were, the, dominant, force, in, politics, and, society, they, initially, formed, a, closed, group, of, about, 50, large, families, called, gentes, who, monopolised, rome, s, magistracies, state, priesthoods, and, senior, military, posts, the, most, prominent, of, these, families, were, the, cornelii, aemilii, claudii, fabii, and, valerii, the, leading, families, power, privilege, and, influence, derived, from, their, wealth, in, particular, from, their, landholdings, their, position, as, patrons, and, their, numerous, clients, the, vast, majority, of, roman, citizens, were, commoners, of, various, social, degrees, they, formed, the, backbone, of, rome, s, economy, as, smallholding, farmers, managers, artisans, traders, and, tenants, in, wartime, they, could, be, summoned, for, military, service, most, had, little, direct, political, influence, during, the, early, republic, the, plebs, or, plebeians, emerged, as, a, self, organised, culturally, distinct, group, of, commoners, with, its, own, internal, hierarchy, laws, customs, and, interests, plebeians, had, no, access, to, high, religious, and, civil, office, for, the, poorest, one, of, the, few, effective, political, tools, was, their, withdrawal, of, labour, and, services, in, a, secessio, plebis, the, first, such, secession, occurred, in, 494, bc, in, protest, at, the, abusive, treatment, of, plebeian, debtors, by, the, wealthy, during, a, famine, the, patrician, senate, was, compelled, to, give, them, direct, access, to, the, written, civil, and, religious, laws, and, to, the, electoral, and, political, process, to, represent, their, interests, the, plebs, elected, tribunes, who, were, personally, sacrosanct, immune, to, arbitrary, arrest, by, any, magistrate, and, had, veto, power, over, legislation, by, 390, bc, several, gallic, tribes, were, invading, italy, from, the, north, the, romans, met, the, gauls, in, pitched, battle, at, the, battle, of, allia, river,

subsequently, rome, was, sacked, by, the, senones, there, is, no, destruction, layer, at, rome, around, this, time, indicating, that, if, a, sack, occurred, it, was, largely, superficial, second, samnite, war, third, samnite, war, from, 343, to, 341, bc, rome, won, two, battles, against, its, samnite, neighbours, but, was, unable, to, consolidate, its, gains, due, to, the, outbreak, of, war, with, former, latin, allies, in, the, latin, war, 340, 338, bc, rome, defeated, a, coalition, of, latins, at, the, battles, of, vesuvius, and, the, trifanum, the, latins, submitted, to, roman, rule, a, second, samnite, war, began, in, 327, bc, the, war, ended, with, samnite, defeat, at, the, battle, of, bovianum, in, 305, bc, by, 304, bc, rome, had, annexed, most, samnite, territory, and, begun, to, establish, colonies, there, but, in, 298, bc, the, samnites, rebelled, and, defeated, a, roman, army, in, a, third, samnite, war, after, this, success, it, built, a, coalition, of, several, previous, enemies, of, rome, the, war, ended, with, roman, victory, in, 290, bc, at, the, battle, of, populonia, in, 282, bc, rome, finished, off, the, last, vestiges, of, etruscan, power, in, the, region, in, the, 4th, century, plebeians, gradually, obtained, political, equality, with, patricians, the, first, plebeian, consular, tribunes, were, elected, in, 400, the, reason, behind, this, sudden, gain, is, unknown, but, it, was, limited, as, patrician, tribunes, retained, preeminence, over, their, plebeian, colleagues, in, 385, bc, the, former, consul, and, saviour, of, the, besieged, capital, marcus, manlius, capitolinus, is, said, to, have, sided, with, the, plebeians, ruined, by, the, sack, and, largely, indebted, to, patricians, according, to, livy, capitolinus, sold, his, estate, to, repay, the, debt, of, many, of, them, and, even, went, over, to, the, plebs, the, first, patrician, to, do, so, nevertheless, the, growing, unrest, he, had, caused, led, to, his, trial, for, seeking, kingly, power, he, was, sentenced, to, death, and, thrown, from, the, tarpeian, rock, between, 376, bc, and, 367, bc, the, tribunes, of, the, plebs, gaius, licinius, stolo, and, lucius, sextius, lateranus, continued, the, plebeian, agitation, and, pushed, for, an, ambitious, legislation, known, as, the, leges, liciniae, sextiae, the, most, important, bill, opened, the, consulship, to, plebeians, other, tribunes, controlled, by, the, patricians, vetoed, the, bills, but, stolo, and, lateranus, retaliated, by, vetoing, the, elections, for, five, years, while, being, continuously, reelected, by, the, plebs, resulting, in, a, stalemate, in, 367, bc, they, carried, a, bill, creating, the, decemviri, sacris, faciundis, a, college, of, ten, priests, of, whom, five, had, to, be, plebeians, thereby, breaking, patricians, monopoly, on, priesthoods, the, resolution, of, the, crisis, came, from, the, dictator, camillus, who, made, a, compromise, with, the, tribunes, he, agreed, to, their, bills, and, they, in, return, consented, to, the, creation, of, the, offices, of, praetor, and, curule, aediles, both, reserved, to, patricians, lateranus, became, the, first, plebeian, consul, in, 366, bc, stolo, followed, in, 361, bc, soon, after, plebeians, were, able, to, hold, both, the, dictatorship, and, the, censorship, the, four, time, consul, gaius, marcius, rutilus, became, the, first, plebeian, dictator, in, 356, bc, and, censor, in, 351, bc, in, 342, bc, the, tribune, of, the, plebs, lucius, genucius, passed, his, leges, genuciae, which, abolished, interest, on, loans, in, a, renewed, effort, to, tackle, indebtedness, required, the, election, of, at, least, one, plebeian, consul, each, year, and, prohibited, magistrates, from, holding, the, same, magistracy, for, the, next, ten, years, or, two, magistracies, in, the, same, year, in, 339, bc, the, plebeian, consul, and, dictator, quintus, publilius, philo, passed, three, laws, extending, the, plebeians, powers, his, first, law, followed, the, lex, genucia, by, reserving, one, censorship, to, plebeians, the, second, made, plebiscites, binding, on, all, citizens, including, patricians, and, the, third, required, the, senate, to, give, its, prior, approval, to, plebiscites, before, they, became, binding, on, all, citizens, during, the, early, republic, consuls, chose, senators, from, among, their, supporters, shortly, before, 312, bc, the, lex, ovinia, transferred, this, power, to, the, censors, who, could, only, remove, senators, for, misconduct, thus, appointing, them, for, life, this, law, strongly, increased, the, power, of, the, senate, which, was, by, now, protected, from, the, influence, of, the, consuls, and, became, the, central, organ, of, government, in, 312, bc, following, this, law, the, patrician, censor, appius, claudius, caecus, appointed, many, more, senators, to, fill, the, new, limit, of, 300, including, descendants, of, freedmen, which, was, deemed, scandalous, caecus, also, launched, a, vast, construction, program, building, the, first, aqueduct, the, aqua, appia, and, the, first, roman, road, the, via, appia, in, 300, bc, the, two, tribunes, of, the, plebs, gnaeus, and, quintus, ogulnius, passed, the, lex, ogulnia, which, created, four, plebeian, pontiffs, equalling, the, number, of, patrician, pontiffs, and, five, plebeian, augurs, outnumbering, the, four, patricians, in, the, college, the, conflict, of, the, orders, ended, with, the, last, secession, of, the, plebs, around, 287, the, dictator, quintus, hortensius, passed, the, lex, hortensia, which, reenacted, the, law, of, 339, bc, making, plebiscites, binding, on, all, citizens, while, also, removing, the, requirement, for, prior, senate, approval, these, events, were, a, political, victory, of, the, wealthy, plebeian, elite, who, exploited, the, economic, difficulties, of, the, plebs, for, their, own, gain, stolo, lateranus, and, genucius, bound, their, bills, attacking, patricians, political, supremacy, with, debt, relief, measures, as, a, result, of, the, end, of, the, patrician, monopoly, on, senior, magistracies, many, small, patrician, gentes, faded, into, history, during, the, 4th, and, 3rd, centuries, bc, due, to, the, lack, of, available, positions, about, a, dozen, remaining, patrician, gentes, and, 20, plebeian, ones, thus, formed, a, new, elite, called, the, nobiles, or, nobilitas, by, the, early, 3rd, century, bc, rome, had, established, itself, as, the, major, power, in, italy, but, had, not, yet, come, into, conflict, with, the, dominant, military, powers, of, the, mediterranean, carthage, and, the, greek, kingdoms, in, 282, several, roman, warships, entered, the, harbour, of, tarentum, triggering, a, violent, reaction, from, the, tarentine, democrats, who, sank, some, the, roman, embassy, sent, to, investigate, the, affair, was, insulted, and, war, was, promptly, declared, facing, a, hopeless, situation, the, tarentines, together, with, the, lucanians, and, samnites, appealed, to, pyrrhus, king, of, epirus, for, military, aid, a, cousin, of, alexander, the, great, he, was, eager, to, build, an, empire, for, himself, in, the, western, mediterranean, and, saw, tarentum, s, plea, as, a, perfect, opportunity, pyrrhus, and, his, army, of, 25, 500, men, with, 20, war, elephants, landed, in, italy, in, 280, bc, the, romans, were, defeated, at, heraclea, as, their, cavalry, were, afraid, of, pyrrhus, s, elephants, pyrrhus, then, marched, on, rome, but, the, romans, concluded, a, peace, in, the, north, and, moved, south, with, reinforcements, placing, pyrrhus, in, danger, of, being, flanked, by, two, consular, armies, pyrrhus, withdrew, to, tarentum, in, 279, bc, pyrrhus, met, the, consuls, publius, decius, mus, and, publius, sulpicius, saverrio, at, the, battle, of, asculum, which, remained, undecided, for, two, days, finally, pyrrhus, personally, charged, into, the, melee, and, won, the, battle, but, at, the, cost, of, an, important, part, of, his, troops, he, allegedly, said, if, we, are, victorious, in, one, more, battle, with, the, romans, we, shall, be, utterly, ruined, he, escaped, the, italian, deadlock, by, answering, a, call, for, help, from, syracuse, where, tyrant, thoenon, was, desperately, fighting, an, invasion, from, carthage, pyrrhus, could, not, let, them, take, the, whole, island, as, it, would, have, compromised, his, ambitions, in, the, western, mediterranean, and, so, declared, war, the, carthaginians, lifted, the, siege, of, syracuse, before, his, arrival, but, he, could, not, entirely, oust, them, from, the, island, as, he, failed, to, take, their, fortress, of, lilybaeum, his, harsh, rule, soon, led, to, widespread, antipathy, among, the, sicilians, some, cities, even, defected, to, carthage, in, 275, bc, pyrrhus, left, the, island, before, he, had, to, face, a, full, scale, rebellion, he, returned, to, italy, where, his, samnite, allies, were, on, the, verge, of, losing, the, war, pyrrhus, again, met, the, romans, at, the, battle, of, beneventum, this, time, the, consul, manius, dentatus, was, victorious, and, even, captured, eight, elephants, pyrrhus, then, withdrew, from, italy, but, left, a, garrison, in, tarentum, to, wage, a, new, campaign, in, greece, against, antigonus, ii, gonatas, of, macedonia, his, death, in, battle, at, argos, in, 272, bc, forced, tarentum, to, surrender, to, rome, rome, and, carthage, were, initially, on, friendly, terms, lastly, in, an, alliance, against, pyrrhus, but, tensions, rapidly, rose, after, the, departure, of, the, epirote, king, between, 288, and, 283, bc, messina, in, sicily, was, taken, by, the, mamertines, a, band, of, mercenaries, formerly, employed, by, agathocles, they, plundered, the, surroundings, until, hiero, ii, the, new, tyrant, of, syracuse, defeated, them, in, either, 269, or, 265, bc, in, effect, under, a, carthaginian, protectorate, the, remaining, mamertines, appealed, to, rome, to, regain, their, independence, senators, were, divided, on, whether, to, help, a, supporter, of, war, the, consul, appius, claudius, caudex, turned, to, one, of, the, popular, assemblies, to, get, a, favourable, vote, by, promising, plunder, to, the, voters, after, the, assembly, ratified, an, alliance, with, the, mamertines, caudex, was, dispatched, to, cross, the, strait, and, lend, aid, messina, fell, under, roman, control, quickly, syracuse, and, carthage, at, war, for, centuries, responded, with, an, alliance, to, counter, the, invasion, and, blockaded, messina, but, caudex, defeated, hiero, and, carthage, separately, his, successor, manius, valerius, maximus, landed, with, an, army, of, 40, 000, men, and, conquered, eastern, sicily, which, prompted, hiero, to, shift, his, allegiance, and, forge, a, long, lasting, alliance, with, rome, in, 262, bc, the, romans, moved, to, the, southern, coast, and, besieged, akragas, in, order, to, raise, the, siege, carthage, sent, reinforcements, including, 60, elephants, the, first, time, they, used, them, but, still, lost, the, battle, nevertheless, rome, could, not, take, all, of, sicily, because, carthage, s, naval, superiority, prevented, it, from, effectively, besieging, coastal, cities, using, a, captured, carthaginian, ship, as, blueprint, rome, therefore, launched, a, massive, construction, program, and, built, 100, quinqueremes, in, only, two, months, it, also, invented, a, new, device, the, corvus, a, grappling, engine, that, enabled, a, crew, to, board, an, enemy, ship, the, consul, for, 260, bc, gnaeus, cornelius, scipio, asina, lost, the, first, naval, skirmish, of, the, war, against, hannibal, gisco, at, lipara, but, his, colleague, gaius, duilius, won, a, great, victory, at, mylae, he, destroyed, or, captured, 44, ships, and, was, the, first, roman, to, receive, a, naval, triumph, which, also, included, captive, carthaginians, for, the, first, time, although, carthage, was, victorious, on, land, at, thermae, in, sicily, the, corvus, gave, a, strong, advantage, to, rome, on, the, waters, the, consul, lucius, cornelius, scipio, asina, s, brother, captured, corsica, in, 259, bc, his, successors, won, the, naval, battles, of, sulci, in, 258, tyndaris, in, 257, bc, and, cape, ecnomus, in, 256, to, hasten, the, end, of, the, war, the, consuls, for, 256, bc, decided, to, carry, the, operations, to, africa, on, carthage, s, homeland, the, consul, marcus, atilius, regulus, landed, on, the, cap, bon, peninsula, with, about, 18, 000, soldiers, he, captured, the, city, of, aspis, repulsed, carthage, s, counterattack, at, adys, and, took, tunis, the, carthaginians, hired, spartan, mercenaries, led, by, xanthippus, to, command, their, troops, in, 255, the, spartan, general, marched, on, regulus, crushing, the, roman, infantry, on, the, bagradas, plain, only, 2, 000, soldiers, escaped, and, regulus, was, captured, the, consuls, for, 255, nonetheless, won, a, naval, victory, at, cape, hermaeum, where, they, captured, 114, warships, this, success, was, spoilt, by, a, storm, that, annihilated, the, victorious, navy, 184, ships, of, 264, sank, 25, 000, soldiers, and, 75, 000, rowers, drowned, the, corvus, considerably, hindered, ships, navigation, and, made, them, vulnerable, during, tempest, it, was, abandoned, after, another, similar, catastrophe, in, 253, bc, these, disasters, prevented, any, significant, campaign, between, 254, and, 252, bc, hostilities, in, sicily, resumed, in, 252, bc, with, rome, s, taking, of, thermae, the, next, year, carthage, besieged, lucius, caecilius, metellus, who, held, panormos, now, palermo, the, consul, had, dug, trenches, to, counter, the, elephants, which, once, hurt, by, missiles, turned, back, on, their, own, army, resulting, in, a, great, victory, for, metellus, rome, then, besieged, the, last, carthaginian, strongholds, in, sicily, lilybaeum, and, drepana, but, these, cities, were, impregnable, by, land, publius, claudius, pulcher, the, consul, of, 249, recklessly, tried, to, take, the, latter, from, the, sea, but, suffered, a, terrible, defeat, his, colleague, lucius, junius, pullus, likewise, lost, his, fleet, off, lilybaeum, without, the, corvus, roman, warships, had, lost, their, advantage, by, now, both, sides, were, drained, and, could, not, undertake, large, scale, operations, the, only, military, activity, during, this, period, was, the, landing, in, sicily, of, hamilcar, barca, in, 247, bc, who, harassed, the, romans, with, a, mercenary, army, from, a, citadel, he, built, on, mt, eryx, unable, to, take, the, punic, fortresses, in, sicily, rome, tried, to, decide, the, war, at, sea, and, built, a, new, navy, thanks, to, a, forced, borrowing, from, the, rich, in, 242, bc, 200, quinqueremes, under, consul, gaius, lutatius, catulus, blockaded, drepana, the, rescue, fleet, from, carthage, was, soundly, defeated, by, catulus, exhausted, and, unable, to, bring, supplies, to, sicily, carthage, sued, for, peace, carthage, had, to, pay, 1, 000, talents, immediately, and, 2, 200, over, ten, years, and, evacuate, sicily, the, fine, was, so, high, that, carthage, could, not, pay, hamilcar, s, mercenaries, who, had, been, shipped, back, to, africa, they, revolted, during, the, mercenary, war, which, carthage, suppressed, with, enormous, difficulty, meanwhile, rome, took, advantage, of, a, similar, revolt, in, sardinia, to, seize, the, island, from, carthage, in, violation, of, the, peace, treaty, this, led, to, permanent, bitterness, in, carthage, after, its, victory, the, republic, shifted, its, attention, to, its, northern, border, as, the, insubres, and, boii, were, threatening, italy, meanwhile, carthage, compensated, the, loss, of, sicily, and, sardinia, with, the, conquest, of, southern, hispania, up, to, salamanca, and, its, rich, silver, mines, this, rapid, expansion, worried, rome, which, concluded, a, treaty, with, hasdrubal, in, 226, stating, that, carthage, could, not, cross, the, ebro, river, but, the, city, of, saguntum, south, of, the, ebro, appealed, to, rome, in, 220, to, act, as, arbitrator, during, a, period, of, internal, strife, hannibal, took, the, city, in, 219, triggering, the, second, punic, war, initially, the, republic, s, plan, was, to, carry, war, outside, italy, sending, the, consuls, p, cornelius, scipio, to, hispania, and, ti, sempronius, longus, to, africa, while, their, naval, superiority, prevented, carthage, from, attacking, from, the, sea, this, plan, was, thwarted, by, hannibal, s, bold, move, to, italy, in, may, 218, he, crossed, the, ebro, with, a, large, army, of, about, 100, 000, soldiers, and, 37, elephants, he, passed, in, gaul, crossed, the, rhone, then, the, alps, possibly, through, the, col, de, clapier, this, exploit, cost, him, almost, half, of, his, troops, but, he, could, now, rely, on, the, boii, and, insubres, still, at, war, with, rome, publius, scipio, who, had, failed, to, block, hannibal, on, the, rhone, sent, his, elder, brother, gnaeus, with, the, main, part, of, his, army, in, hispania, according, to, the, initial, plan, and, went, back, to, italy, with, the, rest, to, resist, hannibal, in, italy, but, he, was, defeated, and, wounded, near, the, ticino, river, hannibal, then, marched, south, and, won, three, outstanding, victories, the, first, one, was, on, the, banks, of, the, trebia, in, december, 218, where, he, defeated, the, other, consul, ti, sempronius, longus, more, than, half, the, roman, army, was, lost, hannibal, then, ravaged, the, country, around, arretium, to, lure, the, new, consul, c, flaminius, into, a, trap, at, lake, trasimene, this, clever, ambush, resulted, in, the, death, of, the, consul, and, the, complete, destruction, of, his, army, of, 30, 000, men, in, 216, the, new, consuls, l, aemilius, paullus, and, c, terentius, varro, mustered, the, biggest, army, possible, with, eight, legions, some, 80, 000, soldiers, twice, as, many, as, the, punic, army, and, confronted, hannibal, who, was, encamped, at, cannae, in, apulia, despite, his, numerical, disadvantage, hannibal, used, his, heavier, cavalry, to, rout, the, roman, wings, and, envelop, their, infantry, which, he, annihilated, in, terms, of, casualties, the, battle, of, cannae, was, the, worst, defeat, in, roman, history, only, 14, 500, soldiers, escaped, and, paullus, was, killed, as, well, as, 80, senators, soon, after, the, boii, ambushed, the, army, of, the, consul, elect, for, 215, l, postumius, albinus, who, died, with, all, his, army, of, 25, 000, men, in, the, battle, of, silva, litana, these, disasters, triggered, a, wave, of, defection, among, roman, allies, with, the, rebellions, of, the, samnites, oscans, lucanians, and, greek, cities, of, southern, italy, in, macedonia, philip, v, also, made, an, alliance, with, hannibal, in, order, to, take, illyria, and, the, area, around, epidamnus, occupied, by, rome, his, attack, on, apollonia, started, the, first, macedonian, war, in, 215, hiero, ii, of, syracuse, died, of, old, age, and, his, young, grandson, hieronymus, broke, the, long, alliance, with, rome, to, side, with, carthage, at, this, desperate, point, the, aggressive, strategy, against, hannibal, the, scipiones, advocated, was, abandoned, in, favour, of, a, slow, reconquest, of, the, lost, territories, since, hannibal, could, not, be, everywhere, to, defend, them, although, he, remained, invincible, on, the, battlefield, defeating, all, the, roman, armies, on, his, way, he, could, not, prevent, claudius, marcellus, from, taking, syracuse, in, 212, after, a, long, siege, nor, the, fall, of, his, bases, of, capua, and, tarentum, in, 211, and, 209, in, hispania, publius, and, gnaeus, scipio, won, the, battles, of, cissa, in, 218, soon, after, hannibal, s, departure, and, dertosa, against, his, brother, hasdrubal, in, 215, which, enabled, them, to, conquer, the, eastern, coast, of, hispania, but, in, 211, hasdrubal, and, mago, barca, successfully, turned, the, celtiberian, tribes, that, supported, the, scipiones, and, attacked, them, simultaneously, at, the, battle, of, the, upper, baetis, in, which, the, scipiones, died, publius, s, son, the, future, scipio, africanus, was, then, elected, with, a, special, proconsulship, to, lead, the, hispanic, campaign, winning, a, series, of, battles, with, ingenious, tactics, in, 209, he, took, carthago, nova, the, main, punic, base, in, hispania, the, next, year, he, defeated, hasdrubal, at, the, battle, of, baecula, after, his, defeat, carthage, ordered, hasdrubal, to, reinforce, his, brother, in, italy, since, he, could, not, use, ships, he, followed, the, same, route, as, his, brother, through, the, alps, but, the, consuls, m, livius, salinator, and, c, claudius, nero, were, awaiting, him, and, defeated, him, in, the, battle, of, the, metaurus, where, hasdrubal, died, it, was, the, turning, point, of, the, war, the, campaign, of, attrition, had, worked, well, hannibal, s, troops, were, now, depleted, he, only, had, one, elephant, left, surus, and, retreated, to, bruttium, on, the, defensive, in, greece, rome, contained, philip, v, without, devoting, too, many, forces, by, allying, with, the, aetolian, league, sparta, and, pergamon, which, also, prevented, philip, from, aiding, hannibal, the, war, with, macedon, resulted, in, a, stalemate, with, the, treaty, of, phoenice, signed, in, 205, in, hispania, scipio, continued, his, successful, campaign, at, the, battles, of, carmona, in, 207, and, ilipa, now, seville, in, 206, which, ended, the, punic, threat, on, the, peninsula, elected, consul, in, 205, he, convinced, the, senate, to, invade, africa, with, the, support, of, the, numidian, king, masinissa, who, had, defected, to, rome, scipio, landed, in, africa, in, 204, he, took, utica, and, then, won, the, battle, of, the, great, plains, which, prompted, carthage, to, open, peace, negotiations, the, talks, failed, because, scipio, wanted, to, impose, harsher, terms, on, carthage, to, prevent, it, from, rising, again, as, a, threat, hannibal, was, therefore, sent, to, face, scipio, at, zama, scipio, could, now, use, the, heavy, numidian, cavalry, of, massinissa, which, had, hitherto, been, so, successful, against, rome, to, rout, the, punic, wings, then, flank, the, infantry, as, hannibal, had, done, at, cannae, defeated, for, the, first, time, hannibal, convinced, the, carthaginian, senate, to, pay, the, war, indemnity, which, was, even, harsher, than, that, of, 241, 10, 000, talents, in, 50, instalments, carthage, also, had, to, give, up, all, its, elephants, all, its, fleet, but, ten, triremes, and, all, its, possessions, outside, its, core, territory, in, africa, what, is, now, tunisia, and, it, could, not, declare, war, without, roman, authorisation, in, effect, carthage, was, condemned, to, be, a, minor, power, while, rome, recovered, from, a, desperate, situation, to, dominate, the, western, mediterranean, rome, s, preoccupation, with, its, war, with, carthage, provided, an, opportunity, for, philip, v, of, macedonia, in, the, north, of, the, greek, peninsula, to, attempt, to, extend, his, power, westward, he, sent, ambassadors, to, hannibal, s, camp, in, italy, to, negotiate, an, alliance, as, common, enemies, of, rome, but, rome, discovered, the, agreement, when, philip, s, emissaries, were, captured, by, a, roman, fleet, the, first, macedonian, war, saw, the, romans, involved, directly, in, only, limited, land, operations, but, they, achieved, their, objective, of, occupying, philip, and, preventing, him, from, aiding, hannibal, the, past, century, had, seen, the, greek, world, dominated, by, the, three, primary, successor, kingdoms, of, alexander, the, great, s, empire, ptolemaic, egypt, macedonia, and, the, seleucid, empire, in, 202, internal, problems, led, to, a, weakening, of, egypt, s, position, disrupting, the, power, balance, among, the, successor, states, macedonia, and, the, seleucid, empire, agreed, to, an, alliance, to, conquer, and, divide, egypt, fearing, this, increasingly, unstable, situation, several, small, greek, kingdoms, sent, delegations, to, rome, to, seek, an, alliance, rome, gave, philip, an, ultimatum, to, cease, his, campaigns, against, rome, s, new, greek, allies, doubting, rome, s, strength, philip, ignored, the, request, and, rome, sent, an, army, of, romans, and, greek, allies, beginning, the, second, macedonian, war, in, 197, the, romans, decisively, defeated, philip, at, the, battle, of, cynoscephalae, and, philip, was, forced, to, give, up, his, recent, greek, conquests, the, romans, declared, the, peace, of, the, greeks, believing, that, philip, s, defeat, now, meant, that, greece, would, be, stable, and, pulled, out, of, greece, entirely, with, egypt, and, macedonia, weakened, the, seleucid, empire, made, increasingly, aggressive, and, successful, attempts, to, conquer, the, entire, greek, world, now, not, only, rome, s, allies, against, philip, but, even, philip, himself, sought, a, roman, alliance, against, the, seleucids, the, situation, was, exacerbated, by, the, fact, that, hannibal, was, now, a, chief, military, advisor, to, the, seleucid, emperor, and, the, two, were, believed, to, be, planning, outright, conquest, not, just, of, greece, but, also, of, rome, the, seleucids, were, much, stronger, than, the, macedonians, had, ever, been, because, they, controlled, much, of, the, former, persian, empire, and, had, almost, entirely, reassembled, alexander, the, great, s, former, empire, fearing, the, worst, the, romans, began, a, major, mobilization, all, but, pulling, out, of, recently, conquered, spain, and, gaul, this, fear, was, shared, by, rome, s, greek, allies, who, now, followed, rome, again, for, the, first, time, since, that, war, a, major, roman, greek, force, was, mobilized, under, the, command, of, the, great, hero, of, the, second, punic, war, scipio, africanus, and, set, out, for, greece, beginning, the, roman, seleucid, war, after, initial, fighting, that, revealed, serious, seleucid, weaknesses, the, seleucids, tried, to, turn, the, roman, strength, against, them, at, the, battle, of, thermopylae, but, were, forced, to, evacuate, greece, the, romans, pursued, the, seleucids, by, crossing, the, hellespont, the, first, time, a, roman, army, had, ever, entered, asia, the, decisive, engagement, was, fought, at, the, battle, of, magnesia, resulting, in, complete, roman, victory, the, seleucids, sued, for, peace, and, rome, forced, them, to, give, up, their, recent, greek, conquests, rome, again, withdrew, from, greece, assuming, or, hoping, that, the, lack, of, a, major, greek, power, would, ensure, a, stable, peace, in, fact, it, did, the, opposite, in, 179, philip, died, his, talented, and, ambitious, son, perseus, took, the, throne, and, showed, a, renewed, interest, in, conquering, greece, with, its, greek, allies, facing, a, major, new, threat, rome, declared, war, on, macedonia, again, starting, the, third, macedonian, war, perseus, initially, had, some, success, against, the, romans, but, rome, responded, by, sending, a, stronger, army, which, decisively, defeated, the, macedonians, at, the, battle, of, pydna, in, 168, the, macedonians, capitulated, ending, the, war, convinced, now, that, the, greeks, and, therefore, the, rest, of, the, region, would, not, have, peace, if, left, alone, rome, decided, to, establish, its, first, permanent, foothold, in, the, greek, world, and, divided, macedonia, into, four, client, republics, yet, macedonian, agitation, continued, the, fourth, macedonian, war, 150, to, 148, bc, was, fought, against, a, macedonian, pretender, to, the, throne, who, was, again, destabilizing, greece, by, trying, to, reestablish, the, old, kingdom, the, romans, swiftly, defeated, the, macedonians, at, the, second, battle, of, pydna, the, achaean, league, seeing, the, direction, of, roman, policy, trending, towards, direct, administration, met, at, corinth, and, declared, war, nominally, against, sparta, but, in, reality, against, rome, it, was, swiftly, defeated, in, 146, the, same, year, as, the, destruction, of, carthage, corinth, was, besieged, and, destroyed, forcing, the, league, s, surrender, rome, decided, to, divide, macedonia, into, two, new, directly, administered, roman, provinces, achaea, and, macedonia, for, carthage, the, third, punic, war, was, a, simple, punitive, mission, after, the, neighbouring, numidians, allied, to, rome, robbed, and, attacked, carthaginian, merchants, treaties, had, forbidden, any, war, with, roman, allies, viewing, defence, against, banditry, as, war, action, rome, decided, to, annihilate, carthage, carthage, was, almost, defenceless, and, submitted, when, besieged, but, the, romans, demanded, complete, surrender, and, removal, of, the, city, into, the, desert, hinterland, far, from, any, coastal, or, harbour, region, the, carthaginians, refused, the, city, was, besieged, and, completely, destroyed,

becoming, one, of, the, most, important, cities, in, the, roman, empire, views, on, the, structural, causes, of, the, republic, s, collapse, differ, one, enduring, thesis, is, that, rome, s, expansion, destabilized, its, social, organization, between, conflicting, interests, the, senate, s, policymaking, blinded, by, its, own, short, term, self, interest, alienated, large, portions, of, society, who, then, joined, powerful, generals, who, sought, to, overthrow, the, system, two, other, theses, have, challenged, this, view, the, first, blames, the, romans, inability, to, conceive, of, plausible, alternatives, to, the, traditional, republican, system, in, a, crisis, without, alternative, the, second, instead, stresses, the, continuity, of, the, republic, until, its, disruption, by, caesar, s, civil, war, and, the, following, two, decades, of, civil, war, created, conditions, for, autocratic, rule, and, made, return, to, republican, politics, impossible, and, per, erich, s, gruen, civil, war, caused, the, fall, of, the, republic, not, vice, versa, a, core, cause, of, the, republic, s, eventual, demise, was, the, loss, of, elite, s, cohesion, from, c, 133, bc, the, ancient, sources, called, this, moral, decay, from, wealth, and, the, hubris, of, rome, s, domination, of, the, mediterranean, modern, sources, have, proposed, multiple, reasons, why, the, elite, lost, cohesion, including, wealth, inequality, and, a, growing, willingness, by, aristocrats, to, transgress, political, norms, especially, in, the, aftermath, of, the, social, war, in, the, winter, of, 138, 137, bc, a, first, slave, uprising, known, as, the, first, servile, war, broke, out, in, sicily, after, initial, successes, the, slaves, led, by, eunus, and, cleon, were, defeated, by, marcus, perperna, and, publius, rupilius, in, 132, bc, in, this, context, tiberius, gracchus, was, elected, plebeian, tribune, in, 133, bc, he, attempted, to, enact, a, law, to, limit, the, amount, of, land, anyone, could, own, and, establish, a, commission, to, distribute, public, lands, to, poor, rural, plebs, the, aristocrats, who, stood, to, lose, an, enormous, amount, of, money, bitterly, opposed, this, proposal, tiberius, submitted, this, law, to, the, plebeian, council, but, it, was, vetoed, by, fellow, tribune, marcus, octavius, tiberius, induced, the, plebs, to, depose, octavius, from, his, office, on, the, grounds, that, octavius, acted, contrary, to, the, manifest, will, of, the, people, a, position, that, was, unprecedented, and, constitutionally, dubious, his, law, was, enacted, and, took, effect, but, when, tiberius, ostentatiously, stood, for, reelection, to, the, tribunate, he, was, murdered, by, his, enemies, tiberius, s, brother, gaius, was, elected, tribune, ten, years, later, in, 123, and, reelected, for, 122, he, induced, the, plebs, to, reinforce, rights, of, appeal, to, the, people, against, capital, extrajudicial, punishments, and, institute, reforms, to, improve, the, people, s, welfare, while, ancient, sources, tend, to, conceive, gracchus, legislation, as, an, elaborate, plot, against, the, authority, of, the, senate, he, showed, no, sign, of, wanting, to, replace, the, senate, in, its, normal, functions, amid, wide, ranging, and, popular, reforms, to, create, grain, subsidies, change, jury, pools, establish, and, require, the, senate, to, assign, provinces, before, elections, gaius, proposed, a, law, that, would, grant, citizenship, rights, to, rome, s, italian, allies, he, stood, for, election, to, a, third, term, in, 121, but, was, defeated, during, violent, protests, over, repeal, of, an, ally, s, colonisation, bill, the, senate, moved, the, first, senatus, consultum, ultimum, against, him, resulting, in, his, death, with, many, others, on, the, aventine, his, legislation, like, that, of, his, brother, survived, the, roman, aristocracy, disliked, the, gracchan, agitation, but, accepted, their, policies, in, 121,

numidian, command, reassigned, to, himself, through, the, popular, assembly, and, with, the, capture, of, jugurtha, at, the, end, of, a, long, campaign, ended, the, war, in, the, aftermath, the,

especially, against, the, military, failure, of, senatorial, leadership, in, the, cimbrian, war, the, cimbrian, war, 113, 101, was, a, far, more, serious, affair, than, the, earlier, gallic, clashes, in, 121, the, germanic, tribes, of, the, cimbri, and, the, teutons, migrated, from, northern, europe, into, rome, s, northern, territories, and, clashed, with, rome, and, its, allies, the, defeat, of, various, aristocrats, in, the, conflict, along, with, marius, s, reputation, for, military, victory, led, to, his, holding, five, successive, consulships, with, little, to, enable, him, to, lead, armies, against, the, threat, at, the, battle, of, aquae, sextiae, and, the, battle, of, vercellae, marius, led, the, roman, armies, which, virtually, annihilated, both, tribes, ending, the, threat,

italy, the, main, causes, of, the, war, were, roman, encroachment, on, allied, lands, due, to, the, republic, s, land, redistribution, programmes, harsh, roman, treatment, of, the, non, citizen, allies, and, roman, unwillingness, to, share, in, the, spoils, of, the, empire, after, the, assassination, in, rome, of, a, conservative, tribune, who, sought, to, grant, the, italians, citizenship, the, allies, took, up, arms, most, ancient, writers, explain, the, conflict, in, terms, of, demands, for, full, citizenship, but, contemporary, rebel, propaganda, coins, indicate, it, may, have, been,

lucius, sergius, catilina, to, overthrow, that, year, s, consuls, in, the, aftermath, of, the, conspiracy, which, was, abetted, by, popular, discontent, the, senate, moved, legislation, to, temper,

crassus, engaged, in, a, political, alliance, traditionally, dubbed, by, scholars, as, the, first, triumvirate, the, alliance, greatly, benefited, the, three, men, caesar, passed, legislation, to, distribute, state, lands, as, poor, relief, while, also, providing, land, for, pompey, s, veterans, he, also, had, pompey, s, eastern, settlements, ratified, for, crassus, he, secured, relief, for, tax, farmers, and, a, place, on, agrarian, commission, caesar, won, for, himself, the, political, support, needed, to, acquire, a, profitable, provincial, command, in, gaul, and, secure, his, political, future, attempting, first, to, pass, portions, of, his, programme, through, the, senate, caesar, found, the, curia, obstinate, he, thus, unveiled, his, alliance, with, pompey, and, crassus, and, moved, his, legislation, before, the, people, instead, political, opposition, to, the, allies, was, immense, caesar, also, facilitated, the, election, of, the, former, patrician, publius, clodius, pulcher, to, the, tribunate, for, 58, clodius, set, about, depriving, caesar, s, senatorial, enemies, of, two, of, their, more, obstinate, leaders, in, cato, and, cicero, clodius, attempted, to, try, cicero, for, executing, citizens, without, a, trial, during, the, catiline, conspiracy, resulting, in, cicero, going, into, self, imposed, exile, clodius, also, passed, a, bill, that, forced, cato, to, lead, the, invasion, of, cyprus, which, would, keep, him, away, from, rome, for, some, years, clodius, also, passed, a, law, to, expand, the, previous, partial, grain, subsidy, to, a, fully, free, grain, dole, for, citizens, after, his, term, as, consul, in, 59, caesar, was, appointed, to, a, five, year, term, as, the, proconsular, governor, of, cisalpine, gaul, part, of, current, northern, italy, transalpine, gaul, current, southern, france, and, illyria, part, of, the, modern, balkans, caesar, sought, cause, to, invade, gaul, modern, france, and, belgium, which, would, give, him, the, dramatic, military, success, he, sought, when, two, local, tribes, began, to, migrate, on, a, route, that, would, take, them, near, not, into, the, roman, province, of, transalpine, gaul, caesar, had, the, barely, sufficient, excuse, he, needed, for, his, gallic, wars, fought, between, 58, and, 49, caesar, defeated, large, armies, at, major, battles, 58, and, 57, in, 55, and, 54, he, made, two, expeditions, into, britain, the, first, roman, to, do, so, caesar, then, defeated, a, union, of, gauls, at, the, battle, of, alesia, completing, the, roman, conquest, of, transalpine, gaul, by, 50, all, of, gaul, lay, in, roman, hands, clodius, formed, armed, gangs, that, terrorised, the, city, and, eventually, began, to, attack, pompey, s, followers, who, in, response, funded, counter, gangs, formed, by, titus, annius, milo, the, political, alliance, of, the, triumvirate, was, crumbling, domitius, ahenobarbus, ran, for, the, consulship, in, 55, promising, to, take, caesar, s, command, from, him, eventually, the, triumvirate, was, renewed, at, lucca, pompey, and, crassus, were, promised, the, consulship, in, 55, and, caesar, s, term, as, governor, was, extended, for, five, years, beginning, in, the, summer, of, 54, a, wave, of, political, corruption, and, violence, swept, rome, this, chaos, reached, a, climax, in, january, of, 52, when, milo, murdered, clodius, in, a, gang, war, in, 53, crassus, launched, a, roman, invasion, of, the, parthian, empire, modern, iraq, and, iran, after, initial, successes, his, army, was, cut, off, deep, in, enemy, territory, surrounded, and, slaughtered, at, the, battle, of, carrhae, in, which, crassus, himself, perished, crassus, s, death, destabilized, the, triumvirate, while, caesar, was, fighting, in, gaul, pompey, proceeded, with, a, legislative, agenda, for, rome, that, revealed, that, he, was, at, best, ambivalent, towards, caesar, pompey, s, wife, julia, who, was, caesar, s, daughter, died, in, childbirth, this, event, severed, the, last, remaining, bond, between, pompey, and, caesar, in, 51, some, roman, senators, demanded, that, caesar, not, be, permitted, to, stand, for, consul, unless, he, turned, over, control, of, his, armies, to, the, state, caesar, chose, civil, war, over, laying, down, his, command, and, facing, trial, on, 1, january, 49, an, agent, of, caesar, presented, an, ultimatum, to, the, senate, the, ultimatum, was, rejected, and, the, senate, then, passed, a, resolution, declaring, that, if, caesar, did, not, lay, down, his, arms, by, july, of, that, year, he, would, be, considered, an, enemy, of, the, republic, meanwhile, the, senators, adopted, pompey, as, their, new, champion, against, caesar, passing, a, senatus, consultum, ultimum, that, vested, pompey, with, dictatorial, powers, on, 10, january, caesar, with, his, veteran, army, crossed, the, river, rubicon, the, legal, boundary, of, roman, italy, beyond, which, no, commander, might, bring, his, army, in, violation, of, roman, laws, and, by, the, spring, of, 49, swept, down, the, italian, peninsula, towards, rome, his, rapid, advance, forced, pompey, the, consuls, and, the, senate, to, abandon, rome, for, greece, caesar, entered, the, city, unopposed, afterwards, caesar, turned, his, attention, to, the, pompeian, stronghold, of, hispania, modern, spain, but, decided, to, tackle, pompey, himself, in, greece, pompey, initially, defeated, caesar, but, failed, to, follow, up, on, the, victory, and, was, decisively, defeated, at, the, battle, of, pharsalus, in, 48, pompey, fled, again, this, time, to, egypt, where, he, was, murdered, pompey, s, death, did, not, end, the, civil, war, in, 46, caesar, lost, perhaps, as, much, as, a, third, of, his, army, but, ultimately, came, back, to, defeat, the, pompeian, army, of, metellus, scipio, in, the, battle, of, thapsus, after, which, the, pompeians, retreated, yet, again, to, hispania, caesar, then, defeated, the, combined, pompeian, forces, at, the, battle, of, munda, with, pompey, defeated, and, order, restored, caesar, wanted, to, achieve, undisputed, control, over, the, government, the, powers, he, gave, himself, were, later, assumed, by, his, imperial, successors, caesar, held, both, the, dictatorship, and, the, tribunate, and, alternated, between, the, consulship, and, the, proconsulship, in, 48, he, was, given, permanent, tribunician, powers, this, made, his, person, sacrosanct, gave, him, the, power, to, veto, the, senate, and, allowed, him, to, dominate, the, plebeian, council, in, 46, caesar, was, given, censorial, powers, which, he, used, to, fill, the, senate, with, his, partisans, he, then, raised, the, membership, of, the, senate, to, 900, this, robbed, the, senatorial, aristocracy, of, its, prestige, and, made, it, increasingly, subservient, to, him, caesar, began, to, prepare, for, a, war, against, the, parthian, empire, since, his, absence, from, rome, would, limit, his, ability, to, install, consuls, he, passed, a, law, that, allowed, him, to, appoint, all, magistrates, and, later, all, consuls, and, tribunes, this, transformed, the, magistrates, from, representatives, of, the, people, to, representatives, of, the, dictator, caesar, was, now, the, primary, figure, of, the, roman, state, enforcing, and, entrenching, his, powers, his, enemies, feared, that, he, had, ambitions, to, become, an, autocratic, ruler, arguing, that, the, roman, republic, was, in, danger, a, group, of, senators, led, by, gaius, cassius, and, marcus, brutus, hatched, a, conspiracy, and, assassinated, caesar, at, a, meeting, of, the, senate, on, 15, march, 44, virtually, all, the, conspirators, fled, the, city, after, caesar, s, death, in, fear, of, retaliation, the, civil, wars, that, followed, destroyed, what, was, left, of, the, republic, after, the, assassination, caesar, s, three, most, important, associates, mark, antony, caesar, s, co, consul, octavian, caesar, s, adopted, son, and, great, nephew, and, lepidus, caesar, s, magister, equitum, formed, an, alliance, known, as, the, second, triumvirate, the, conspirators, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, philippi, in, 42, following, philippi, rome, s, territories, were, divided, between, the, triumvirs, but, the, agreement, was, fragile, antony, detested, octavian, and, spent, most, of, his, time, in, the, east, while, lepidus, favoured, antony, but, felt, himself, obscured, by, his, colleagues, following, the, defeat, of, sextus, pompeius, a, dispute, between, lepidus, and, octavian, regarding, the, allocation, of, lands, broke, out, and, in, 36, bc, lepidus, was, forced, into, exile, in, circeii, and, stripped, of, all, his, offices, except, that, of, pontifex, maximus, his, former, provinces, were, awarded, to, octavian, antony, meanwhile, married, caesar, s, lover, cleopatra, of, ptolemaic, egypt, intending, to, use, wealthy, egypt, as, a, base, to, dominate, rome, the, ambitious, octavian, built, a, power, base, of, patronage, and, then, launched, a, campaign, against, antony, another, civil, war, broke, out, between, octavian, on, one, hand, and, antony, and, cleopatra, on, the, other, this, culminated, in, the, latter, s, defeat, at, actium, in, 31, bc, octavian, s, forces, then, chased, antony, and, cleopatra, to, alexandria, where, they, both, committed, suicide, in, 30, bc, octavian, was, granted, a, series, of, special, powers, including, sole, imperium, within, the, city, of, rome, permanent, consular, powers, and, credit, for, every, roman, military, victory, in, 27, he, was, granted, the, use, of, the, name, augustus, from, which, point, he, is, generally, considered, the, first, roman, emperor, the, constitutional, history, of, the, roman, republic, began, with, the, revolution, that, overthrew, the, monarchy, in, 509, bc, and, ended, with, constitutional, reforms, that, transformed, the, republic, into, what, would, effectively, be, the, roman, empire, in, 27, bc, the, roman, republic, s, constitution, was, a, constantly, evolving, unwritten, set, of, guidelines, and, principles, passed, down, mainly, through, precedent, by, which, the, government, and, its, politics, operated, the, senate, s, authority, derived, from, the, senators, esteem, and, prestige, this, esteem, and, prestige, were, based, on, both, precedent, and, custom, as, well, as, the, senators, calibre, and, reputation, the, senate, passed, decrees, called, senatus, consulta, these, were, officially, advice, from, the, senate, to, a, magistrate, but, in, practice, the, magistrates, usually, followed, them, through, the, course, of, the, middle, republic, and, rome, s, expansion, the, senate, became, more, dominant, in, the, state, the, only, institution, with, the, expertise, to, administer, the, empire, effectively, it, controlled, state, finances, assignment, of, magistrates, external, affairs, and, deployment, of, military, forces, also, a, powerful, religious, body, it, received, reports, of, omens, and, directed, roman, responses, thereto, when, its, prerogatives, started, to, be, challenged, in, the, 2nd, century, the, senate, lost, its, customary, preapproval, for, legislation, moreover, after, the, precedent, set, in, 121, bc, with, the, killing, of, gaius, gracchus, the, senate, claimed, to, assume, the, power, to, issue, a, senatus, consultum, ultimum, such, decrees, directed, magistrates, to, take, whatever, actions, were, necessary, to, safeguard, the, state, irrespective, of, legality, and, signalled, the, senate, s, willingness, to, support, that, magistrate, if, such, actions, were, later, challenged, in, the, courts, its, members, were, usually, appointed, by, censors, who, ordinarily, selected, newly, elected, magistrates, for, membership, in, the, senate, making, the, senate, a, partially, elected, body, status, was, not, hereditary, and, there, were, always, some, new, men, though, sons, of, former, magistrates, found, it, easier, to, be, elected, to, the, qualifying, magistracies, during, emergencies, a, dictator, could, be, appointed, for, the, purpose, of, appointing, senators, as, was, done, after, the, battle, of, cannae, however, by, the, end, of, the, republic, men, such, as, caesar, and, the, members, of, the, second, triumvirate, usurped, these, powers, for, themselves, the, legal, status, of, roman, citizenship, was, limited, and, a, vital, prerequisite, to, possessing, many, important, legal, rights, such, as, the, right, to, trial, and, appeal, marry, vote, hold, office, enter, binding, contracts, and, to, special, tax, exemptions, an, adult, male, citizen, with, the, full, complement, of, legal, and, political, rights, was, called, optimo, iure, lit, having, the, greatest, rights, citizens, who, were, optimo, iure, elected, their, assemblies, whereupon, the, assemblies, elected, magistrates, enacted, legislation, presided, over, trials, in, capital, cases, declared, war, and, peace, and, forged, or, dissolved, treaties, there, were, two, types, of, legislative, assemblies, the, comitia, committees, which, were, assemblies, of, all, citizens, optimo, jure, and, the, consilia, councils, which, were, assemblies, of, specific, groups, of, citizens, optimo, jure, citizens, were, organized, on, the, basis, of, centuries, and, tribes, which, each, gathered, into, their, own, assemblies, the, comitia, centuriata, centuriate, assembly, was, the, assembly, of, the, centuries, that, is, soldiers, the, comitia, centuriata, s, president, was, usually, a, consul, the, centuries, voted, one, at, a, time, until, a, measure, received, support, from, a, majority, the, comitia, centuriata, elected, magistrates, who, had, imperium, consuls, and, praetors, it, also, elected, censors, only, the, comitia, centuriata, could, declare, war, and, ratify, the, results, of, a, census, it, served, as, the, highest, court, of, appeal, in, certain, judicial, cases, the, assembly, of, the, tribes, that, is, the, citizens, of, rome, the, comitia, tributa, was, presided, over, by, a, consul, and, composed, of, 35, tribes, once, a, measure, received, support, from, a, majority, of, the, tribes, voting, ended, while, it, did, not, pass, many, laws, the, comitia, tributa, did, elect, quaestors, curule, aediles, and, military, tribunes, the, plebeian, council, was, identical, to, the, assembly, of, the, tribes, but, excluded, the, patricians, they, elected, their, own, officers, plebeian, tribunes, and, plebeian, aediles, usually, a, plebeian, tribune, would, preside, over, the, assembly, this, assembly, passed, most, laws, and, could, act, as, a, court, of, appeal, each, republican, magistrate, held, certain, constitutional, powers, each, was, assigned, a, provincia, by, the, senate, this, was, the, scope, of, that, particular, office, holder, s, authority, it, could, apply, to, a, geographic, area, or, to, a, particular, responsibility, or, task, the, powers, of, a, magistrate, came, from, the, people, of, rome, both, plebeians, and, patricians, imperium, was, held, by, both, consuls, and, praetors, strictly, speaking, it, was, the, authority, to, command, a, military, force, but, in, reality, it, carried, broad, authority, in, other, public, spheres, such, as, diplomacy, and, the, justice, system, in, extreme, cases, those, with, the, imperium, power, could, sentence, roman, citizens, to, death, all, magistrates, also, had, the, power, of, coercitio, coercion, magistrates, used, this, to, maintain, public, order, by, imposing, punishment, for, crimes, magistrates, also, had, both, the, power, and, the, duty, to, look, for, omens, this, power, could, also, be, used, to, obstruct, political, opponents, one, check, on, a, magistrate, s, power, was, collega, collegiality, each, magisterial, office, was, held, concurrently, by, at, least, two, people, another, such, check, was, provocatio, while, in, rome, all, citizens, were, protected, from, coercion, by, provocatio, an, early, form, of, due, process, it, was, a, precursor, to, habeas, corpus, if, any, magistrate, tried, to, use, the, powers, of, the, state, against, a, citizen, that, citizen, could, appeal, the, magistrate, s, decision, to, a, tribune, in, addition, once, a, magistrate, s, one, year, term, of, office, expired, he, would, have, to, wait, ten, years, before, serving, in, that, office, again, this, created, problems, for, some, consuls, and, praetors, and, these, magistrates, occasionally, had, their, imperium, extended, in, effect, they, retained, the, powers, of, the, office, as, a, promagistrate, without, officially, holding, that, office, in, times, of, military, emergency, a, dictator, was, appointed, for, a, term, of, six, months, constitutional, government, was, dissolved, and, the, dictator, was, the, absolute, master, of, the, state, when, the, dictator, s, term, ended, constitutional, government, was, restored, the, censor, was, a, magistrate, in, ancient, rome, who, was, responsible, for, maintaining, the, census, supervising, public, morality, and, overseeing, certain, aspects, of, the, government, s, finances, the, power, of, the, censor, was, absolute, no, magistrate, could, oppose, his, decisions, and, only, another, censor, who, succeeded, him, could, cancel, those, decisions, the, censor, s, regulation, of, public, morality, is, the, origin, of, the, modern, meaning, of, the, words, censor, and, censorship, during, the, census, they, could, enroll, citizens, in, the, senate, or, purge, them, from,

greatest, enemies, such, as, pyrrhus, and, hannibal, to, win, early, battles, but, lose, the, war, during, this, period, roman, soldiers, seem, to, have, been, modelled, after, those, of, the, etruscans, to, the, north, who, themselves, are, believed, to, have, copied, their, style, of, warfare, from, the, greeks, traditionally, the, introduction, of, the, phalanx, formation, into, the, roman, army, is, ascribed, to, the, city, s, penultimate, king, servius, tullius, ruled, 578, 534, the, phalanx, was, effective, in, large, open, spaces, but, not, on, the, hilly, terrain, of, the, central, italian, peninsula, in, the, 4th, century, the, romans, replaced, it, with, the, more, flexible, manipular, formation, this, change, is, sometimes, attributed, to, marcus, furius, camillus, and, placed, shortly, after, the, gallic, invasion, of, 390, more, likely, it, was, copied, from, rome, s, samnite, enemies, to, the, south, during, this, period, an, army, formation, of, around, 5, 000, men, of, both, heavy, and, light, infantry, was, known, as, a, legion, maniples, were, units, of, 120, men, each, drawn, from, a, single, infantry, class, they, were, typically, deployed, into, three, discrete, lines, based, on, the, three, heavy, infantry, types, the, three, infantry, classes, may, have, retained, some, slight, parallel, to, social, divisions, within, roman, society, but, at, least, officially, the, three, lines, were, based, upon, age, and, experience, rather, than, social, class, young, unproven, men, served, in, the, first, line, older, men, with, some, military, experience, in, the, second, and, veteran, troops, of, advanced, age, and, experience, in, the, third, the, heavy, infantry, of, the, maniples, was, supported, by, a, number, of, light, infantry, and, cavalry, troops, typically, 300, horsemen, per, manipular, legion, the, cavalry, was, drawn, primarily, from, the, richest, class, of, equestrians, there, was, an, additional, class, of, troops, that, followed, the, army, without, specific, martial, roles, and, was, deployed, to, the, rear, of, the, third, line, its, role, in, accompanying, the, army, was, primarily, to, supply, any, vacancies, that, might, occur, in, the, maniples, the, light, infantry, consisted, of, 1, 200, unarmoured, skirmishing, troops, drawn, from, the, youngest, and, lower, social, classes, they, were, armed, with, a, sword, a, small, shield, and, several, light, javelins, rome, s, military, confederation, with, the, other, peoples, of, the, italian, peninsula, meant, that, half, of, its, army, was, provided, by, the, socii, according, to, polybius, rome, could, draw, on, 770, 000, men, at, the, beginning, of, the, second, punic, war, of, which, 700, 000, were, infantry, and, 70, 000, met, the, requirements, for, cavalry, a, small, navy, had, operated, at, a, fairly, low, level, after, about, 300, but, it, was, massively, upgraded, about, 40, years, later, during, the, first, punic, war, after, a, period, of, frenetic, construction, the, navy, mushroomed, to, more, than, 400, ships, on, the, carthaginian, punic, pattern, once, completed, it, could, accommodate, up, to, 100, 000, sailors, and, embarked, troops, for, battle, the, navy, thereafter, declined, in, size, in, 217, near, the, beginning, of, the, second, punic, war, rome, was, forced, to, effectively, ignore, its, long, standing, principle, that, its, soldiers, must, be, both, citizens, and, property, owners, severe, social, stresses, population, decline, and, the, greater, collapse, of, the, middle, classes,
