the, german, confederation, was, an, association, of, 39, predominantly, german, speaking, sovereign, states, in, central, europe, it, was, created, by, the, congress, of, vienna, in, 1815, as, a, replacement, of, the, former, holy, roman, empire, which, had, been, dissolved, in, 1806, as, a, result, of, the, napoleonic, wars, the, confederation, had, only, one, organ, the, federal, convention, also, federal, assembly, or, confederate, diet, the, convention, consisted, of, the, representatives, of, the, member, states, the, most, important, issues, had, to, be, decided, on, unanimously, the, convention, was, presided, over, by, the, representative, of, austria, this, was, a, formality, however, as, the, confederation, did, not, have, a, head, of, state, since, it, was, not, a, state, the, confederation, on, the, one, hand, was, a, strong, alliance, between, its, member, states, because, federal, law, was, superior, to, state, law, the, decisions, of, the, federal, convention, were, binding, for, the, member, states, additionally, the, confederation, had, been, established, for, eternity, and, was, impossible, to, dissolve, legally, with, no, member, states, being, able, to, leave, it, and, no, new, member, being, able, to, join, without, universal, consent, in, the, federal, convention, on, the, other, hand, the, confederation, was, weakened, by, its, very, structure, and, member, states, partly, because, the, most, important, decisions, in, the, federal, convention, required, unanimity, and, the, purpose, of, the, confederation, was, limited, to, only, security, matters, on, top, of, that, the, functioning, of, the, confederation, depended, on, the, cooperation, of, the, two, most, populous, member, states, austria, and, prussia, which, in, reality, were, often, in, opposition, the, german, revolutions, of, 1848, 1849, motivated, by, liberal, democratic, socialist, and, nationalist, sentiments, attempted, to, transform, the, confederation, into, a, unified, german, federal, state, with, a, liberal, constitution, usually, called, the, frankfurt, constitution, in, english, the, federal, convention, was, dissolved, on, 12, july, 1848, but, was, re, established, in, 1850, after, the, revolution, was, crushed, by, austria, prussia, and, other, states, the, confederation, was, finally, dissolved, after, the, victory, of, the, kingdom, of, prussia, in, the, seven, weeks, war, over, the, austrian, empire, in, 1866, the, dispute, over, which, had, the, inherent, right, to, rule, german, lands, ended, in, favour, of, prussia, leading, to, the, creation, of, the, north, german, confederation, under, prussian, leadership, in, 1867, to, which, the, eastern, portions, of, the, kingdom, of, prussia, were, added, a, number, of, south, german, states, remained, independent, until, they, joined, the, north, german, confederation, which, was, renamed, and, proclaimed, as, the, german, empire, in, 1871, as, the, unified, germany, aside, from, austria, with, the, prussian, king, as, emperor, kaiser, after, the, victory, over, french, emperor, napoleon, iii, in, the, franco, prussian, war, of, 1870, most, historians, have, judged, the, confederation, to, have, been, weak, and, ineffective, as, well, as, an, obstacle, to, the, creation, of, a, german, nation, state, this, weakness, was, part, of, its, design, as, the, european, great, powers, including, prussia, and, especially, austria, did, not, want, it, to, become, a, nation, state, however, the, confederation, was, not, a, loose, tie, between, the, german, states, as, it, was, impossible, to, leave, the, confederation, and, as, confederation, law, stood, above, the, law, of, the, aligned, states, the, constitutional, weakness, of, the, confederation, lay, in, the, principle, of, unanimity, in, the, diet, and, the, limits, of, the, confederation, s, scope, it, was, essentially, a, military, alliance, to, defend, germany, against, external, attacks, and, internal, riots, ironically, the, war, of, 1866, proved, its, ineffectiveness, as, it, was, unable, to, combine, the, federal, troops, in, order, to, fight, the, prussian, secession, the, war, of, the, third, coalition, lasted, from, about, 1803, to, 1806, following, defeat, at, the, battle, of, austerlitz, by, the, french, under, napoleon, in, december, 1805, holy, roman, emperor, francis, ii, abdicated, and, the, empire, was, dissolved, on, 6, august, 1806, the, resulting, treaty, of, pressburg, established, the, confederation, of, the, rhine, in, july, 1806, joining, sixteen, of, france, s, allies, among, the, german, states, including, bavaria, and, w, rttemberg, after, the, battle, of, jena, auerstedt, of, october, 1806, in, the, war, of, the, fourth, coalition, various, other, german, states, including, saxony, and, westphalia, also, joined, the, confederation, only, austria, prussia, danish, holstein, swedish, pomerania, and, the, french, occupied, principality, of, erfurt, stayed, outside, the, confederation, of, the, rhine, the, war, of, the, sixth, coalition, from, 1812, to, winter, 1814, saw, the, defeat, of, napoleon, and, the, liberation, of, germany, in, june, 1814, the, famous, german, patriot, heinrich, vom, stein, created, the, central, managing, authority, for, germany, zentralverwaltungsbeh, rde, in, frankfurt, to, replace, the, defunct, confederation, of, the, rhine, however, plenipotentiaries, gathered, at, the, congress, of, vienna, were, determined, to, create, a, weaker, union, of, german, states, than, envisaged, by, stein, the, german, confederation, was, created, by, the, 9th, act, of, the, congress, of, vienna, on, 8, june, 1815, after, being, alluded, to, in, article, 6, of, the, 1814, treaty, of, paris, ending, the, war, of, the, sixth, coalition, the, confederation, was, formally, created, by, a, second, treaty, the, final, act, of, the, ministerial, conference, to, complete, and, consolidate, the, organization, of, the, german, confederation, this, treaty, was, not, concluded, and, signed, by, the, parties, until, 15, may, 1820, states, joined, the, german, confederation, by, becoming, parties, to, the, second, treaty, the, states, designated, for, inclusion, in, the, confederation, were, in, 1839, as, compensation, for, the, loss, of, part, of, the, province, of, luxemburg, to, belgium, the, duchy, of, limburg, was, created, and, became, a, member, of, the, german, confederation, held, by, the, netherlands, jointly, with, luxembourg, until, the, dissolution, of, 1866, in, 1867, the, duchy, was, declared, to, be, an, integral, part, of, the, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, the, cities, of, maastricht, and, venlo, were, not, included, in, the, confederation, the, austrian, empire, and, the, kingdom, of, prussia, were, the, largest, and, by, far, the, most, powerful, members, of, the, confederation, large, parts, of, both, countries, were, not, included, in, the, confederation, because, they, had, not, been, part, of, the, former, holy, roman, empire, nor, were, the, greater, parts, of, their, armed, forces, incorporated, in, the, federal, army, austria, and, prussia, each, had, one, vote, in, the, federal, assembly, six, other, major, states, had, one, vote, each, in, the, federal, assembly, the, kingdom, of, bavaria, the, kingdom, of, saxony, the, kingdom, of, w, rttemberg, the, electorate, of, hesse, the, grand, duchy, of, baden, and, the, grand, duchy, of, hesse, three, foreign, monarchs, ruled, member, states, the, king, of, denmark, as, duke, of, holstein, and, duke, of, saxe, lauenburg, the, king, of, the, netherlands, as, grand, duke, of, luxembourg, and, from, 1839, duke, of, limburg, and, the, king, of, the, united, kingdom, until, 1837, as, king, of, hanover, were, members, of, the, german, confederation, each, of, them, had, a, vote, in, the, federal, assembly, at, its, foundation, in, 1815, four, member, states, were, ruled, by, foreign, monarchs, as, the, king, of, denmark, was, duke, of, both, holstein, and, saxe, lauenburg, the, four, free, cities, of, bremen, frankfurt, hamburg, and, l, beck, shared, one, vote, in, the, federal, assembly, the, 23, remaining, states, at, its, formation, in, 1815, shared, five, votes, in, the, federal, assembly, there, were, therefore, 17, votes, in, the, federal, assembly, the, rules, of, the, confederation, provided, for, three, different, types, of, military, interventions, other, military, conflicts, were, foreign, to, the, confederation, bundesfremd, an, example, is, austria, s, oppression, of, the, uprising, in, northern, italy, in, 1848, and, 1849, as, these, austrian, territories, lay, outside, of, the, confederation, s, borders, during, the, existence, of, the, confederation, there, was, only, one, federal, war, the, war, against, denmark, beginning, with, the, schleswig, holstein, uprising, in, 1848, the, first, schleswig, war, the, conflict, became, a, federal, war, when, the, bundestag, demanded, from, denmark, to, withdraw, its, troops, from, schleswig, april, 12, and, recognized, the, revolutionary, of, schleswig, holstein, april, 22, the, confederation, was, transformed, into, the, german, empire, of, 1848, prussia, was, de, facto, the, most, important, member, state, conducting, the, war, for, germany, there, are, several, examples, for, federal, executions, and, especially, federal, interventions, in, 1863, the, confederation, ordered, a, federal, execution, against, the, duke, of, holstein, the, danish, king, federal, troops, occupied, holstein, which, was, a, member, state, after, this, austria, and, prussia, declared, war, on, denmark, the, second, schleswig, war, or, deutsch, d, nischer, krieg, in, german, as, schleswig, and, denmark, were, not, member, states, this, war, was, foreign, to, the, confederation, the, confederation, took, no, part, in, this, war, a, federal, intervention, confronted, for, example, the, raid, of, the, revolutionaries, in, baden, in, april, 1848, in, june, 1866, the, federal, convention, decided, to, takes, measures, against, prussia, this, decision, was, technically, not, a, federal, execution, for, a, lack, of, time, to, observe, the, actual, procedure, prussia, had, violated, according, to, the, majority, of, the, convention, federal, law, by, sending, its, troops, to, holstein, the, decision, led, to, the, war, in, summer, 1866, that, ended, with, the, dissolution, of, the, confederation, known, as, seven, weeks, war, or, by, other, names, the, german, federal, army, deutsches, bundesheer, was, supposed, to, collectively, defend, the, german, confederation, from, external, enemies, primarily, france, successive, laws, passed, by, the, confederate, diet, set, the, form, and, function, of, the, army, as, well, as, contribution, limits, of, the, member, states, the, diet, had, the, power, to, declare, war, and, was, responsible, for, appointing, a, supreme, commander, of, the, army, and, commanders, of, the, individual, army, corps, this, made, mobilization, extremely, slow, and, added, a, political, dimension, to, the, army, in, addition, the, diet, oversaw, the, construction, and, maintenance, of, several, german, federal, fortresses, and, collected, funds, annually, from, the, member, states, for, this, purpose, projections, of, army, strength, were, published, in, 1835, but, the, work, of, forming, the, army, corps, did, not, commence, until, 1840, as, a, consequence, of, the, rhine, crisis, money, for, the, fortresses, were, determined, by, an, act, of, the, confederate, diet, in, that, year, by, 1846, luxemburg, still, had, not, formed, its, own, contingent, and, prussia, was, rebuffed, for, offering, to, supply, 1, 450, men, to, garrison, the, luxemburg, fortress, that, should, have, been, supplied, by, waldeck, and, the, two, lippes, in, that, same, year, it, was, decided, that, a, common, symbol, for, the, federal, army, should, be, the, old, imperial, two, headed, eagle, but, without, crown, scepter, or, sword, as, any, of, those, devices, encroached, on, the, individual, sovereignty, of, the, states, king, frederick, william, iv, of, prussia, was, among, those, who, derided, the, disarmed, imperial, eagle, as, a, national, symbol, the, german, federal, army, was, divided, into, ten, army, corps, later, expanded, to, include, a, reserve, corps, however, the, army, corps, were, not, exclusive, to, the, german, confederation, but, composed, from, the, national, armies, of, the, member, states, and, did, not, include, all, of, the, armed, forces, of, a, state, for, example, prussia, s, army, consisted, of, nine, army, corps, but, contributed, only, three, to, the, german, federal, army, the, strength, of, the, mobilized, german, federal, army, was, projected, to, total, 303, 484, men, in, 1835, and, 391, 634, men, in, 1860, with, the, individual, states, providing, the, following, figures, between, 1806, and, 1815, napoleon, organized, the, german, states, aside, from, prussia, and, austria, into, the, confederation, of, the, rhine, but, this, collapsed, after, his, defeats, in, 1812, to, 1815, the, german, confederation, had, roughly, the, same, boundaries, as, the, empire, at, the, time, of, the, french, revolution, less, what, is, now, belgium, it, also, kept, intact, most, of, confederation, s, reconstituted, member, states, and, their, boundaries, the, member, states, drastically, reduced, to, 39, from, more, than, 300, see, kleinstaaterei, under, the, holy, roman, empire, were, recognized, as, fully, sovereign, the, members, pledged, themselves, to, mutual, defense, and, joint, maintenance, of, the, fortresses, at, mainz, the, city, of, luxembourg, rastatt, ulm, and, landau, the, only, organ, of, the, confederation, was, the, federal, assembly, officially, bundesversammlung, often, called, bundestag, which, consisted, of, the, delegates, of, the, states, governments, there, was, no, head, of, state, but, the, austrian, delegate, presided, over, the, assembly, according, to, the, bundesakte, austria, did, not, have, extra, powers, but, consequently, the, austrian, delegate, was, called, pr, sidialgesandther, and, austria, the, pr, sidialmacht, presiding, power, the, assembly, met, in, frankfurt, the, confederation, was, enabled, to, accept, and, deploy, ambassadors, it, allowed, ambassadors, of, the, european, powers, to, the, assembly, but, rarely, deployed, ambassadors, itself, during, the, revolution, of, 1848, 49, the, federal, assembly, was, inactive, it, transferred, its, powers, to, the, provisorische, zentralgewalt, the, revolutionary, german, central, government, of, the, frankfurt, national, assembly, after, crushing, the, revolution, and, illegally, disbanding, the, national, assembly, the, prussian, king, failed, to, create, a, german, nation, state, by, himself, the, federal, assembly, was, revived, in, 1850, on, austrian, initiative, but, only, fully, reinstalled, in, the, summer, of, 1851, rivalry, between, prussia, and, austria, grew, more, and, more, especially, after, 1859, the, confederation, was, dissolved, in, 1866, after, the, austro, prussian, war, and, was, succeeded, in, 1866, by, the, prussian, dominated, north, german, confederation, unlike, the, german, confederation, the, north, german, confederation, was, in, fact, a, true, state, its, territory, comprised, the, parts, of, the, german, confederation, north, of, the, river, main, plus, prussia, s, eastern, territories, and, the, duchy, of, schleswig, but, excluded, austria, and, the, other, southern, german, states, prussia, s, influence, was, widened, by, the, franco, prussian, war, resulting, in, the, proclamation, of, the, german, empire, at, versailles, on, 18, january, 1871, which, united, the, north, german, federation, with, the, southern, german, states, all, the, constituent, states, of, the, former, german, confederation, became, part, of, the, kaiserreich, in, 1871, except, austria, luxembourg, the, duchy, of, limburg, and, liechtenstein, the, late, 18th, century, was, a, period, of, political, economic, intellectual, and, cultural, reforms, the, enlightenment, represented, by, figures, such, as, locke, rousseau, voltaire, and, adam, smith, but, also, involving, early, romanticism, and, climaxing, with, the, french, revolution, where, freedom, of, the, individual, and, nation, was, asserted, against, privilege, and, custom, representing, a, great, variety, of, types, and, theories, they, were, largely, a, response, to, the, disintegration, of, previous, cultural, patterns, coupled, with, new, patterns, of, production, specifically, the, rise, of, industrial, capitalism, however, the, defeat, of, napoleon, enabled, conservative, and, reactionary, regimes, such, as, those, of, the, kingdom, of, prussia, the, austrian, empire, and, tsarist, russia, to, survive, laying, the, groundwork, for, the, congress, of, vienna, and, the, alliance, that, strove, to, oppose, radical, demands, for, change, ushered, in, by, the, french, revolution, with, austria, s, position, on, the, continent, now, intact, and, ostensibly, secure, under, its, reactionary, premier, klemens, von, metternich, the, habsburg, empire, would, serve, as, a, barrier, to, contain, the, emergence, of, italian, and, german, nation, states, as, well, in, addition, to, containing, france, but, this, reactionary, balance, of, power, aimed, at, blocking, german, and, italian, nationalism, on, the, continent, was, precarious, after, napoleon, s, final, defeat, in, 1815, the, surviving, member, states, of, the, defunct, holy, roman, empire, joined, to, form, the, german, confederation, deutscher, bund, a, rather, loose, organization, especially, because, the, two, great, rivals, the, austrian, empire, and, the, kingdom, of, prussia, each, feared, domination, by, the, other, in, prussia, the, hohenzollern, rulers, forged, a, centralized, state, by, the, time, of, the, napoleonic, wars, prussia, grounded, in, the, virtues, of, its, established, military, aristocracy, the, junkers, and, stratified, by, rigid, hierarchical, lines, had, been, surpassed, militarily, and, economically, by, france, after, 1807, prussia, s, defeats, by, napoleonic, france, highlighted, the, need, for, administrative, economic, and, social, reforms, to, improve, the, efficiency, of, the, bureaucracy, and, encourage, practical, merit, based, education, inspired, by, the, napoleonic, organization, of, german, and, italian, principalities, the, prussian, reform, movement, led, by, karl, august, von, hardenberg, and, count, stein, was, conservative, enacted, to, preserve, aristocratic, privilege, while, modernizing, institutions, outside, prussia, industrialization, progressed, slowly, and, was, held, back, because, of, political, disunity, conflicts, of, interest, between, the, nobility, and, merchants, and, the, continued, existence, of, the, guild, system, which, discouraged, competition, and, innovation, while, this, kept, the, middle, class, at, bay, affording, the, old, order, a, measure, of, stability, not, seen, in, france, prussia, s, vulnerability, to, napoleon, s, military, proved, to, many, among, the, old, order, that, a, fragile, divided, and, traditionalist, germany, would, be, easy, prey, for, its, cohesive, and, industrializing, neighbor, the, reforms, laid, the, foundation, for, prussia, s, future, military, might, by, professionalizing, the, military, and, decreeing, universal, military, conscription, in, order, to, industrialize, prussia, working, within, the, framework, provided, by, the, old, aristocratic, institutions, land, reforms, were, enacted, to, break, the, monopoly, of, the, junker, s, on, land, ownership, thereby, also, abolishing, among, other, things, the, feudal, practice, of, serfdom, although, the, forces, unleashed, by, the, french, revolution, were, seemingly, under, control, after, the, vienna, congress, the, conflict, between, conservative, forces, and, liberal, nationalists, was, only, deferred, at, best, the, era, until, the, failed, 1848, revolution, in, which, these, tensions, built, up, is, commonly, referred, to, as, vorm, rz, pre, march, in, reference, to, the, outbreak, of, riots, in, march, 1848, this, conflict, pitted, the, forces, of, the, old, order, against, those, inspired, by, the, french, revolution, and, the, rights, of, man, the, breakdown, of, the, competition, was, roughly, the, emerging, capitalist, bourgeoisie, and, petit, bourgeoisie, engaged, mostly, in, commerce, trade, and, industry, and, the, growing, and, increasingly, radicalized, industrial, working, class, and, the, other, side, associated, with, landowning, aristocracy, or, military, aristocracy, the, junker, s, in, prussia, the, habsburg, monarchy, in, austria, and, the, conservative, notables, of, the, small, princely, states, and, city, states, in, germany, meanwhile, demands, for, change, from, below, had, been, fomenting, due, to, the, influence, of, the, french, revolution, throughout, the, german, confederation, austrian, influence, was, paramount, drawing, the, ire, of, the, nationalist, movements, metternich, considered, nationalism, especially, the, nationalist, youth, movement, the, most, pressing, danger, german, nationalism, might, not, only, repudiate, austrian, dominance, of, the, confederation, but, also, stimulate, nationalist, sentiment, within, the, austrian, empire, itself, in, a, multi, national, polyglot, state, in, which, slavs, and, magyars, outnumbered, the, germans, the, prospects, of, czech, slovak, hungarian, polish, serb, or, croatian, sentiment, along, with, middle, class, liberalism, was, certainly, horrifying, to, the, monarchist, landed, aristocracy, figures, like, august, heinrich, hoffmann, von, fallersleben,

middle, class, german, youth, to, nationalist, and, democratic, ideas, which, took, the, form, of, the, nationalistic, and, liberal, democratic, college, fraternities, known, as, the, burschenschaften, the, wartburg, festival, in, 1817, celebrated, martin, luther, as, a, proto, german, nationalist, linking, lutheranism, to, german, nationalism, and, helping, arouse, religious, sentiments, for, the, cause, of, german, nationhood, the, festival, culminated, in, the, burning, of, several, books, and, other, items, that, symbolized, reactionary, attitudes, one, item, was, a, book, by, august, von, kotzebue, in, 1819, kotzebue, was, accused, of, spying, for, russia, and, then, murdered, by, a, theological, student, karl, ludwig, sand, who, was, executed, for, the, crime,

to, romanticism, at, the, universities, high, powered, professors, developed, international, reputations, especially, in, the, humanities, led, by, history, and, philology, which, brought, a, new,

populated, by, germans, many, people, of, other, ethnic, groups, lived, within, its, borders, further, efforts, to, improve, the, confederation, began, in, 1834, with, the, establishment, of, a, customs, union, the, zollverein, in, 1834, the, prussian, regime, sought, to, stimulate, wider, trade, advantages, and, industrialism, by, decree, a, logical, continuation, of, the, program, of, stein, and, hardenberg, less, than, two, decades, earlier, historians, have, seen, three, prussian, goals, as, a, political, tool, to, eliminate, austrian, influence, in, germany, as, a, way, to, improve, the, economies, and, to, strengthen, germany, against, potential, french, aggression, while, reducing, the, economic, independence, of, smaller, states, inadvertently, these, reforms, sparked, the, unification, movement, and, augmented, a, middle, class, demanding, further, political, rights, but, at, the, time, backwardness, and, prussia, s, fears, of, its, stronger, neighbors, were, greater, concerns, the, customs, union, opened, up, a, common, market, ended, tariffs, between, states, and, standardized, weights, measures, and, currencies, within, member, states, excluding, austria, forming, the, basis, of, a, proto, national, economy, by, 1842, the, zollverein, included, most, german, states, within, the, next, twenty, years, the, output, of, german, furnaces, increased, fourfold, coal, production, grew, rapidly, as, well, in, turn, german, industry, especially, the, works, established, by, the, krupp, family, introduced, the, steel, gun, cast, steel, axle, and, a, breech, loading, rifle, exemplifying, germany, s, successful, application, of, technology, to, weaponry, germany, s, security, was, greatly, enhanced, leaving, the, prussian, state, and, the,

for, manufactured, goods, as, it, did, beforehand, however, by, developing, a, strong, industrial, base, the, prussian, state, strengthened, the, middle, class, and, thus, the, nationalist, movement, economic, integration, especially, increased, national, consciousness, among, the, german, states, made, political, unity, a, far, likelier, scenario, germany, finally, began, exhibiting, all, the, features, of, a, proto, nation, the, crucial, factor, enabling, prussia, s, conservative, regime, to, survive, the, vorm, rz, era, was, a, rough, coalition, between, leading, sectors, of, the, landed, upper, class, and, the, emerging, commercial, and, manufacturing, interests, even, if, the, commercial, and, industrial, element, is, weak, it, must, be, strong, enough, or, soon, become, strong, enough, to, become, worthy, of, co, optation, and, the, french, revolution, terrified, enough, perceptive, elements, of, prussia, s, junker, s, for, the, state, to, be, sufficiently, accommodating, while, relative, stability, was, maintained, until, 1848, with, enough, bourgeois, elements, still, content, to, exchange, the, right, to, rule, for, the, right, to, make, money, the, landed, upper, class, found, its, economic, base, sinking, while, the, zollverein, brought, economic, progress, and, helped, to, keep, the, bourgeoisie, at, bay, for, a, while, it, increased, the, ranks, of, the, middle, class, swiftly, the, very, social, base, for, the, nationalism, and, liberalism, that, the, prussian, state, sought, to, stem, the, zollverein, was, a, move, toward, economic, integration, modern, industrial, capitalism, and, the, victory, of, centralism, over, localism, quickly, bringing, to, an, end, the, era, of, guilds, in, the, small, german, princely, states, this, led, to, the, 1844, revolt, of, the, silesian, weavers, who, saw, their, livelihood, destroyed, by, the, flood, of, new, manufactures, the, zollverein, also, weakened, austrian, domination, of, the, confederation,

greater, german, solution, the, former, favored, offering, the, imperial, crown, to, prussia, the, latter, favored, the, habsburg, crown, in, vienna, which, would, integrate, austria, proper, and, bohemia, but, not, hungary, into, the, new, germany, in, may, to, august, the, assembly, installed, a, provisional, german, central, government, while, conservatives, swiftly, moved, against, the, reformers, as, in, austria, and, russia, this, middle, class, assertion, increased, authoritarian, and, reactionary, sentiments, among, the, landed, upper, class, whose, economic, position, was, declining, they, turned, to, political, levers, to, preserve, their, rule, as, the, prussian, army, proved, loyal, and, the, peasants, were, uninterested, friedrich, wilhelm, regained, his, confidence, the, assembly, belatedly, issued, its, declaration, of, the, rights, of, the, german, people, a, constitution, was, drawn, up, excluding, austria, which, openly, rejected, the, assembly, and, the, leadership, of, the, reich, was, offered, to, friedrich, wilhelm, who, refused, to, pick, up, a, crown, from, the, gutter, as, the, monarchist, forces, marched, their, armies, to, crush,

called, for, a, confederation, of, north, german, states, the, erfurt, union, austria, and, russia, fearing, a, strong, prussian, dominated, germany, responded, by, pressuring, saxony, and, hanover, to, withdraw, and, forced, prussia, to, abandon, the, scheme, in, a, treaty, dubbed, the, humiliation, of, olm, tz, a, new, generation, of, statesmen, responded, to, popular, demands, for, national,

elements, of, the, middle, class, with, a, combination, of, threats, and, reforms, reacting, to, the, revolutionary, sentiments, expressed, in, 1848, by, providing, them, with, the, economic, opportunities, for, which, the, urban, middle, sectors, had, been, fighting, the, german, confederation, ended, as, a, result, of, the, austro, prussian, war, of, 1866, between, the, austrian, empire,

germany, however, due, to, the, successful, prosecution, of, the, franco, prussian, war, the, four, southern, states, joined, the, north, german, confederation, by, treaties, in, november, 1870, as, the, franco, prussian, war, drew, to, a, close, king, ludwig, ii, of, bavaria, was, persuaded, to, ask, king, wilhelm, to, assume, the, crown, of, the, new, german, empire, on, 1, january, 1871, the,

of, a, federal, state, bundesstaat, and, the, north, german, confederation, was, a, federal, state, with, some, elements, of, an, association, of, states, still, the, discussions, and, ideas, of, the, period, 1815, 66, had, a, huge, influence, on, the, constitution, of, the, north, german, confederation, most, notably, may, be, the, federal, council, the, organ, representing, the, member, states, it, is, a, certain, copy, of, the, 1815, federal, convention, of, the, german, confederation, the, successor, of, that, federal, council, of, 1867, is, the, modern, bundesrat, of, the, federal, republic, the, german, confederation, does, not, play, a, very, prominent, role, in, german, historiography, and, national, culture, it, is, mainly, seen, negatively, as, an, instrument, to, oppress, the, liberal, democratic, and, national, movements, of, the, period, on, the, contrary, the, march, revolution, 1849, 49, with, its, events, and, institutions, attract, much, more, attention, and,
