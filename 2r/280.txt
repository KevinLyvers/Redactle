wars, from, the, 7th, to, 11th, centuries, between, multiple, arab, dynasties, and, the, byzantine, empire, the, muslim, arab, caliphates, conquered, large, parts, of, the, christian, byzantine, empire, and, unsuccessfully, attacked, the, byzantine, capital, of, constantinople, the, frontier, between, the, warring, states, remained, almost, static, for, three, centuries, of, frequent, warfare, before, the, byzantines, were, able, to, recapture, some, of, the, lost, territory, the, conflicts, began, during, the, early, muslim, conquests, under, the, expansionist, rashidun, caliphate, part, of, the, initial, spread, of, islam, in, the, 630s, rashidun, forces, from, arabia, attacked, and, quickly, overran, byzantium, s, southern, provinces, syria, was, captured, in, 639, and, egypt, was, conquered, in, 642, the, exarchate, of, africa, was, gradually, captured, between, 647, and, 670, from, the, 650s, onwards, arab, navies, entered, the, mediterranean, sea, which, became, a, major, battleground, both, sides, launched, raids, and, counter, raids, against, islands, and, coastal, settlements, the, rashiduns, were, succeeded, by, the, umayyad, caliphate, in, 661, who, over, the, next, fifty, years, captured, byzantine, cyrenaica, and, launched, repeated, raids, into, byzantine, asia, minor, umayyad, forces, twice, placed, constantinople, under, siege, in, 674, to, 678, and, 717, to, 718, but, were, unable, to, capture, the, heavily, fortified, byzantine, capital, following, the, failed, second, siege, the, border, stabilized, at, the, taurus, mountains, in, asia, minor, the, umayyads, launched, frequent, attacks, across, this, frontier, which, was, heavily, fortified, by, both, sides, and, the, surrounding, region, became, depopulated, during, this, period, the, byzantines, were, usually, on, the, defensive, avoiding, open, field, battles, and, preferring, to, retreat, to, their, fortified, strongholds, after, 740, they, began, to, launch, their, own, raids, across, the, frontier, and, by, sea, in, 750, the, umayyads, were, overthrown, by, the, abbasid, caliphate, who, were, less, expansionist, than, their, predecessors, and, did, not, seek, to, eliminate, the, byzantines, embassies, were, exchanged, and, there, were, several, periods, of, truce, nevertheless, conflict, remained, the, norm, with, almost, annual, raids, and, counter, raids, either, by, the, abbasid, government, or, by, local, client, rulers, which, continued, until, the, mid, 10th, century, byzantine, attempts, to, take, back, the, lands, they, had, lost, only, provoked, abbasid, retaliation, in, the, form, of, destructive, invasions, of, asia, minor, arab, naval, raids, reached, a, peak, in, the, 9th, and, early, 10th, centuries, their, fleets, attacked, the, coasts, of, italy, and, dalmatia, while, abassid, vassals, conquered, crete, in, 827, and, gradually, took, sicily, from, 831, to, 878, due, to, political, instability, beginning, in, 861, the, abbasid, state, entered, a, period, of, decline, and, fragmentation, simultaneously, the, byzantines, began, a, resurgence, under, their, emperors, of, the, macedonian, dynasty, from, c, 920, to, 976, the, byzantines, pushed, arab, forces, back, recovering, some, of, their, lost, territories, in, northern, syria, and, armenia, the, emirate, of, crete, was, reconquered, in, 961, by, the, end, of, the, 10th, century, the, fatimid, caliphate, had, replaced, the, abassids, as, the, major, arab, power, they, halted, the, byzantine, reconquests, although, border, conflicts, continued, the, frontier, remained, stable, until, the, seljuk, turks, began, to, take, territory, from, both, the, arabs, and, byzantines, in, the, 1040s, and, 1050s, forming, the, seljuk, empire, and, beginning, the, byzantine, seljuk, wars, the, prolonged, and, escalating, byzantine, sasanian, wars, of, the, 6th, and, 7th, centuries, and, the, recurring, outbreaks, of, bubonic, plague, plague, of, justinian, left, both, empires, exhausted, and, vulnerable, in, the, face, of, the, sudden, emergence, and, expansion, of, the, arabs, the, last, of, the, wars, between, the, roman, and, persian, empires, ended, with, victory, for, the, byzantines, emperor, heraclius, regained, all, lost, territories, and, restored, the, true, cross, to, jerusalem, in, 629, nevertheless, neither, empire, was, given, any, chance, to, recover, as, within, a, few, years, they, found, themselves, in, conflict, with, the, arabs, newly, united, by, islam, which, according, to, howard, johnston, can, only, be, likened, to, a, human, tsunami, according, to, george, liska, the, unnecessarily, prolonged, byzantine, persian, conflict, opened, the, way, for, islam, in, the, late, 620s, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, had, already, managed, to, unify, much, of, arabia, under, muslim, rule, via, conquest, as, well, as, making, alliances, with, neighboring, tribes, and, it, was, under, his, leadership, that, the, first, muslim, byzantine, skirmishes, took, place, just, a, few, months, after, emperor, heraclius, and, the, persian, general, shahrbaraz, agreed, on, terms, for, the, withdrawal, of, persian, troops, from, occupied, byzantine, eastern, provinces, in, 629, arab, and, byzantine, troops, confronted, each, other, at, the, battle, of, mu, tah, in, response, to, the, murder, of, muhammad, s, ambassador, at, the, hands, of, the, ghassanids, a, byzantine, vassal, kingdom, muhammad, died, in, 632, and, was, succeeded, by, abu, bakr, the, first, caliph, with, undisputed, control, of, the, entire, arabian, peninsula, after, the, successful, ridda, wars, which, resulted, in, the, consolidation, of, a, powerful, muslim, state, throughout, the, peninsula, according, to, muslim, biographies, muhammed, having, received, intelligence, that, byzantine, forces, were, concentrating, in, northern, arabia, with, intentions, of, invading, arabia, led, a, muslim, army, north, to, tabuk, in, present, day, northwestern, saudi, arabia, with, the, intention, of, pre, emptively, engaging, the, byzantine, army, however, the, byzantine, army, had, retreated, beforehand, though, it, was, not, a, battle, in, the, typical, sense, nevertheless, the, event, represented, the, first, arab, encounter, against, the, byzantines, it, did, not, however, lead, immediately, to, a, military, confrontation, there, is, no, contemporary, byzantine, account, of, the, tabuk, expedition, and, many, of, the, details, come, from, much, later, muslim, sources, it, has, been, argued, that, there, is, in, one, byzantine, source, possibly, referencing, the, battle, of, mu, tah, traditionally, dated, 629, but, this, is, not, certain, the, first, engagements, may, have, started, as, conflicts, with, the, arab, client, states, of, the, byzantine, and, sassanid, empires, the, ghassanids, and, the, lakhmids, of, al, hirah, in, any, case, muslim, arabs, after, 634, certainly, pursued, a, full, blown, offensive, against, both, empires, resulting, in, the, conquest, of, the, levant, egypt, and, persia, for, islam, the, most, successful, arab, generals, were, khalid, ibn, al, walid, and, amr, ibn, al, as, in, the, levant, the, invading, rashidun, army, were, engaged, by, a, byzantine, army, composed, of, imperial, troops, as, well, as, local, levies, according, to, islamic, historians, monophysites, and, jews, throughout, syria, welcomed, the, arabs, as, liberators, as, they, were, discontented, with, the, rule, of, the, byzantines, the, roman, emperor, heraclius, had, fallen, ill, and, was, unable, to, personally, lead, his, armies, to, resist, the, arab, conquests, of, syria, and, roman, paelestina, in, 634, in, a, battle, fought, near, ajnadayn, in, the, summer, of, 634, the, rashidun, caliphate, army, achieved, a, decisive, victory, after, their, victory, at, the, fahl, muslim, forces, conquered, damascus, in, 634, under, the, command, of, khalid, ibn, al, walid, the, byzantine, response, involved, the, collection, and, dispatch, of, the, maximum, number, of, available, troops, under, major, commanders, including, theodore, trithyrius, and, the, armenian, general, vahan, to, eject, the, muslims, from, their, newly, won, territories, at, the, battle, of, yarmouk, in, 636, however, the, muslims, having, studied, the, ground, in, detail, lured, the, byzantines, into, pitched, battle, which, the, byzantines, usually, avoided, and, into, a, series, of, costly, assaults, before, turning, the, deep, valleys, and, cliffs, into, a, catastrophic, death, trap, heraclius, farewell, exclamation, according, to, the, 9th, century, historian, al, baladhuri, while, departing, antioch, for, constantinople, is, expressive, of, his, disappointment, peace, unto, thee, o, syria, and, what, an, excellent, country, this, is, for, the, enemy, the, impact, of, syria, s, loss, on, the, byzantines, is, illustrated, by, joannes, zonaras, words, since, then, the, race, of, the, ishmaelites, did, not, cease, from, invading, and, plundering, the, entire, territory, of, the, romans, in, april, 637, the, arabs, after, a, long, siege, captured, jerusalem, which, was, surrendered, by, patriarch, sophronius, in, the, summer, of, 637, the, muslims, conquered, gaza, and, during, the, same, period, the, byzantine, authorities, in, egypt, and, mesopotamia, purchased, an, expensive, truce, which, lasted, three, years, for, egypt, and, one, year, for, mesopotamia, antioch, fell, to, the, muslim, armies, in, late, 637, and, by, then, the, muslims, occupied, the, whole, of, northern, syria, except, for, upper, mesopotamia, which, they, granted, a, one, year, truce, at, the, expiration, of, this, truce, in, 638, 639, the, arabs, overran, byzantine, mesopotamia, and, byzantine, armenia, and, terminated, the, conquest, of, palestine, by, storming, caesarea, maritima, and, effecting, their, final, capture, of, ascalon, in, december, 639, the, muslims, departed, from, palestine, to, invade, egypt, in, early, 640, by, the, time, heraclius, died, much, of, egypt, had, been, lost, and, by, 637, 638, the, whole, of, syria, was, in, the, hands, of, the, armies, of, islam, with, 3, 500, 4, 000, troops, under, his, command, amr, ibn, al, a, as, first, crossed, into, egypt, from, palestine, at, the, end, of, 639, or, the, beginning, of, 640, he, was, progressively, joined, by, further, reinforcements, notably, 12, 000, soldiers, by, zubayr, ibn, al, awwam, amr, first, besieged, and, conquered, babylon, fortress, and, then, attacked, alexandria, the, byzantines, divided, and, shocked, by, the, sudden, loss, of, so, much, territory, agreed, to, give, up, the, city, by, september, 642, the, fall, of, alexandria, extinguished, byzantine, rule, in, egypt, and, allowed, the, muslims, to, continue, their, military, expansion, into, north, africa, between, 643, and, 644, amr, completed, the, conquest, of, cyrenaica, uthman, succeeded, caliph, umar, after, his, death, according, to, arab, historians, the, local, christian, copts, welcomed, the, arabs, just, as, the, monophysites, did, in, jerusalem, the, loss, of, this, lucrative, province, deprived, the, byzantines, of, their, valuable, wheat, supply, thereby, causing, food, shortages, throughout, the, byzantine, empire, and, weakening, its, armies, in, the, following, decades, the, byzantine, navy, briefly, won, back, alexandria, in, 645, but, lost, it, again, in, 646, shortly, after, the, battle, of, nikiou, the, islamic, forces, raided, sicily, in, 652, while, cyprus, and, crete, were, captured, in, 653, however, crete, reverted, to, eastern, roman, rule, until, the, 820s, in, 647, a, rashidun, arab, army, led, by, abdallah, ibn, al, sa, ad, invaded, the, byzantine, exarchate, of, africa, tripolitania, was, conquered, followed, by, sufetula, 150, miles, 240, km, south, of, carthage, and, the, governor, and, self, proclaimed, emperor, of, africa, gregory, was, killed, abdallah, s, booty, laden, force, returned, to, egypt, in, 648, after, gregory, s, successor, gennadius, promised, them, an, annual, tribute, of, some, 300, 000, nomismata, following, a, civil, war, in, the, arab, empire, the, umayyads, came, to, power, under, muawiyah, i, under, the, umayyads, the, conquest, of, the, remaining, byzantine, and, northern, berber, territories, in, north, africa, was, completed, and, the, arabs, were, able, to, move, across, large, parts, of, the, berber, world, invading, visigothic, spain, through, the, strait, of, gibraltar, under, the, command, of, the, allegedly, berber, general, tariq, ibn, ziyad, but, this, happened, only, after, they, developed, a, naval, power, of, their, own, and, they, conquered, and, destroyed, the, byzantine, stronghold, of, carthage, between, 695, and, 698, the, loss, of, africa, meant, that, soon, byzantine, control, of, the, western, mediterranean, was, challenged, by, a, new, and, expanding, arab, fleet, operating, from, tunisia, muawiyah, began, consolidating, the, arab, territory, from, the, aral, sea, to, the, western, border, of, egypt, he, put, a, governor, in, place, in, egypt, at, al, fustat, and, launched, raids, into, anatolia, in, 663, then, from, 665, to, 689, a, new, north, african, campaign, was, launched, to, protect, egypt, from, flank, attack, by, byzantine, cyrene, an, arab, army, of, 40, 000, took, barca, defeating, 30, 000, byzantines, a, vanguard, of, 10, 000, arabs, under, uqba, ibn, nafi, followed, from, damascus, in, 670, kairouan, modern, tunisia, was, established, as, a, base, for, further, invasions, kairouan, would, become, the, capital, of, the, islamic, province, of, ifriqiya, and, one, of, the, main, arabo, islamic, religious, centers, in, the, middle, ages, then, ibn, nafi, plunged, into, the, heart, of, the, country, traversed, the, wilderness, in, which, his, successors, erected, the, splendid, capitals, of, fes, and, morocco, and, at, length, penetrated, to, the, verge, of, the, atlantic, and, the, great, desert, in, his, conquest, of, the, maghreb, uqba, ibn, nafi, took, the, coastal, cities, of, bejaia, and, tangier, overwhelming, what, had, once, been, the, roman, province, of, mauretania, where, he, was, finally, halted, as, the, historian, luis, garcia, de, valdeavellano, explains, in, their, struggle, against, the, byzantines, and, the, berbers, the, arab, chieftains, had, greatly, extended, their, african, dominions, and, as, early, as, the, year, 682, uqba, had, reached, the, shores, of, the, atlantic, but, he, was, unable, to, occupy, tangier, for, he, was, forced, to, turn, back, toward, the, atlas, mountains, by, a, man, who, became, known, to, history, and, legend, as, count, julian, as, the, first, tide, of, the, muslim, conquests, in, the, near, east, ebbed, off, and, a, semi, permanent, border, between, the, two, powers, was, established, a, wide, zone, unclaimed, by, either, byzantines, or, arabs, and, virtually, deserted, known, in, arabic, as, al, aw, the, outer, lands, and, in, greek, as, ta, akra, the, extremities, emerged, in, cilicia, along, the, southern, approaches, of, the, taurus, and, anti, taurus, mountain, ranges, leaving, syria, in, muslim, and, the, anatolian, plateau, in, byzantine, hands, both, emperor, heraclius, and, the, caliph, umar, r, 634, 644, pursued, a, strategy, of, destruction, within, this, zone, trying, to, transform, it, into, an, effective, barrier, between, the, two, realms, nevertheless, the, umayyads, still, considered, the, complete, subjugation, of, byzantium, as, their, ultimate, objective, their, thinking, was, dominated, by, islamic, teaching, which, placed, the, infidel, byzantines, in, the, d, r, al, arb, the, house, of, war, which, in, the, words, of, islamic, scholar, hugh, n, kennedy, the, muslims, should, attack, whenever, possible, rather, than, peace, interrupted, by, occasional, conflict, the, normal, pattern, was, seen, to, be, conflict, interrupted, by, occasional, temporary, truce, hudna, true, peace, ul, could, only, come, when, the, enemy, accepted, islam, or, tributary, status, both, as, governor, of, syria, and, later, as, caliph, muawiyah, i, r, 661, 680, was, the, driving, force, of, the, muslim, effort, against, byzantium, especially, by, his, creation, of, a, fleet, which, challenged, the, byzantine, navy, and, raided, the, byzantine, islands, and, coasts, to, stop, the, byzantine, harassment, from, the, sea, during, the, arab, byzantine, wars, in, 649, muawiyah, set, up, a, navy, manned, by, monophysitise, christian, copt, and, jacobite, syrian, christian, sailors, and, muslim, troops, this, resulted, in, the, defeat, of, the, byzantine, navy, at, the, battle, of, the, masts, in, 655, opening, up, the, mediterranean, the, shocking, defeat, of, the, imperial, fleet, by, the, young, muslim, navy, at, the, battle, of, the, masts, in, 655, was, of, critical, importance, it, opened, up, the, mediterranean, hitherto, a, roman, lake, to, arab, expansion, and, began, a, centuries, long, series, of, naval, conflicts, over, the, control, of, the, mediterranean, waterways, 500, byzantine, ships, were, destroyed, in, the, battle, and, emperor, constans, ii, was, almost, killed, under, the, instructions, of, the, caliph, uthman, ibn, affan, muawiyah, then, prepared, for, the, siege, of, constantinople, trade, between, the, muslim, eastern, and, southern, shores, and, the, christian, northern, shores, almost, ceased, during, this, period, isolating, western, europe, from, developments, in, the, muslim, world, in, antiquity, and, again, in, the, high, middle, ages, the, voyage, from, italy, to, alexandria, was, commonplace, in, early, islamic, times, the, two, countries, were, so, remote, that, even, the, most, basic, information, was, unknown, kennedy, muawiyah, also, initiated, the, first, large, scale, raids, into, anatolia, from, 641, on, these, expeditions, aiming, both, at, plunder, and, at, weakening, and, keeping, the, byzantines, at, bay, as, well, as, the, corresponding, retaliatory, byzantine, raids, eventually, became, established, as, a, fixture, of, byzantine, arab, warfare, for, the, next, three, centuries, the, outbreak, of, the, muslim, civil, war, in, 656, bought, a, precious, breathing, pause, for, byzantium, which, emperor, constans, ii, r, 641, 668, used, to, shore, up, his, defences, extend, and, consolidate, his, control, over, armenia, and, most, importantly, initiate, a, major, army, reform, with, lasting, effect, the, establishment, of, the, themata, the, large, territorial, commands, into, which, anatolia, the, major, contiguous, territory, remaining, to, the, empire, was, divided, the, remains, of, the, old, field, armies, were, settled, in, each, of, them, and, soldiers, were, allocated, land, there, in, payment, of, their, service, the, themata, would, form, the, backbone, of, the, byzantine, defensive, system, for, centuries, to, come, after, his, victory, in, the, civil, war, muawiyah, launched, a, series, of, attacks, against, byzantine, holdings, in, africa, sicily, and, the, east, by, 670, the, muslim, fleet, had, penetrated, into, the, sea, of, marmara, and, stayed, at, cyzicus, during, the, winter, four, years, later, a, massive, muslim, fleet, reappeared, in, the, marmara, and, re, established, a, base, at, cyzicus, from, there, they, raided, the, byzantine, coasts, almost, at, will, finally, in, 676, muawiyah, sent, an, army, to, invest, constantinople, from, land, as, well, beginning, the, first, arab, siege, of, the, city, constantine, iv, r, 661, 685, however, used, a, devastating, new, weapon, that, came, to, be, known, as, greek, fire, invented, by, a, christian, refugee, from, syria, named, kallinikos, of, heliopolis, to, decisively, defeat, the, attacking, umayyad, navy, in, the, sea, of, marmara, resulting, in, the, lifting, of, the, siege, in, 678, the, returning, muslim, fleet, suffered, further, losses, due, to, storms, while, the, army, lost, many, men, to, the, thematic, armies, who, attacked, them, on, their, route, back, among, those, killed, in, the, siege, was, eyup, the, standard, bearer, of, muhammed, and, the, last, of, his, companions, to, muslims, today, his, tomb, is, considered, one, of, the, holiest, sites, in, istanbul, the, setback, at, constantinople, was, followed, by, further, reverses, across, the, vast, muslim, empire, as, gibbon, writes, this, mahometan, alexander, who, sighed, for, new, worlds, was, unable, to, preserve, his, recent, conquests, by, the, universal, defection, of, the, greeks, and, africans, he, was, recalled, from, the, shores, of, the, atlantic, his, forces, were, directed, at, putting, down, rebellions, and, in, one, such, battle, he, was, surrounded, by, insurgents, and, killed, then, the, third, governor, of, africa, zuheir, was, overthrown, by, a, powerful, army, sent, from, constantinople, by, constantine, iv, for, the, relief, of, carthage, meanwhile, a, second, arab, civil, war, was, raging, in, arabia, and, syria, resulting, in, a, series, of, four, caliphs, between, the, death, of, muawiyah, in, 680, and, the, ascension, of, abd, al, malik, in, 685, and, was, ongoing, until, 692, with, the, death, of, the, rebel, leader, the, saracen, wars, of, justinian, ii, r, 685, 695, and, 705, 711, last, emperor, of, the, heraclian, dynasty, reflected, the, general, chaos, of, the, age, after, a, successful, campaign, he, made, a, truce, with, the, arabs, agreeing, on, joint, possession, of, armenia, iberia, and, cyprus, however, by, removing, 12, 000, christian, mardaites, from, their, native, lebanon, he, removed, a, major, obstacle, for, the, arabs, in, syria, and, in, 692, after, the, disastrous, battle, of, sebastopolis, the, muslims, invaded, and, conquered, all, of, armenia, deposed, in, 695, with, carthage, lost, in, 698, justinian, returned, to, power, from, 705, to, 711, his, second, reign, was, marked, by, arab, victories, in, asia, minor, and, civil, unrest, reportedly, he, ordered, his, guards, to, execute, the, only, unit, that, had, not, deserted, him, after, one, battle, to, prevent, their, desertion, in, the, next, justinian, s, first, and, second, depositions, were, followed, by, internal, disorder, with, successive, revolts, and, emperors, lacking, legitimacy, or, support, in, this, climate, the, umayyads, consolidated, their, control, of, armenia, and, cilicia, and, began, preparing, a, renewed, offensive, against, constantinople, in, byzantium, the, general, leo, the, isaurian, r, 717, 741, had, just, seized, the, throne, in, march, 717, when, the, massive, muslim, army, under, the, famed, umayyad, prince, and, general, maslama, ibn, abd, al, malik, began, moving, towards, the, imperial, capital, the, caliphate, s, army, and, navy, led, by, maslama, numbered, some, 120, 000, men, and, 1, 800, ships, according, to, the, sources, whatever, the, real, number, it, was, a, huge, force, far, larger, than, the, imperial, army, thankfully, for, leo, and, the, empire, the, capital, s, sea, walls, had, recently, been, repaired, and, strengthened, in, addition, the, emperor, concluded, an, alliance, with, the, bulgar, khan, tervel, who, agreed, to, harass, the, invaders, rear, from, july, 717, to, august, 718, the, city, was, besieged, by, land, and, sea, by, the, muslims, who, built, an, extensive, double, line, of, circumvallation, and, contravallation, on, the, landward, side, isolating, the, capital, their, attempt, to, complete, the, blockade, by, sea, however, failed, when, the, byzantine, navy, employed, greek, fire, against, them, the, arab, fleet, kept, well, off, the, city, walls, leaving, constantinople, s, supply, routes, open, forced, to, extend, the, siege, into, winter, the, besieging, army, suffered, horrendous, casualties, from, the, cold, and, the,

minor, the, crews, of, the, new, fleets, were, composed, mostly, of, christians, who, began, defecting, in, large, numbers, while, the, land, forces, were, ambushed, and, defeated, in, bithynia, as, famine, and, an, epidemic, continued, to, plague, the, arab, camp, the, siege, was, abandoned, on, 15, august, 718, on, its, return, the, arab, fleet, suffered, further, casualties, to, storms, and, an, eruption, of, the, volcano, of, thera, the, first, wave, of, the, muslim, conquests, ended, with, the, siege, of, constantinople, in, 718, and, the, border, between, the, two, empires, became, stabilized, along, the, mountains, of, eastern, anatolia, raids, and, counter, raids, continued, on, both, sides, and, became, almost, ritualized, but, the, prospect, of, outright, conquest, of, byzantium, by, the, caliphate, receded, this, led, to, far, more, regular, and, often, friendly, diplomatic, contacts, as, well, as, a, reciprocal, recognition, of, the, two, empires, in, response, to, the, muslim, threat, which, reached, its, peak, in, the, first, half, of, the, 8th, century, the, isaurian, emperors, adopted, the, policy, of, iconoclasm, which, was, abandoned, in, 786, only, to, be, readopted, in, the, 820s, and, finally, abandoned, in, 843, under, the, macedonian, dynasty, exploiting, the, decline, and, fragmentation, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, the, byzantines, gradually, went, on, the, offensive, and, recovered, much, territory, in, the, 10th, century, which, was, lost, however, after, 1071, to, the, seljuk, turks, following, the, failure, to, capture, constantinople, in, 717, 718, the, umayyads, for, a, time, diverted, their, attention, elsewhere, allowing, the, byzantines, to, take, to, the, offensive, making, some, gains, in, armenia, from, 720, 721, however, the, arab, armies, resumed, their, expeditions, against, byzantine, anatolia, although, now, they, were, no, longer, aimed, at, conquest, but, rather, large, scale, raids, plundering, and, devastating, the, countryside, and, only, occasionally, attacking, forts, or, major, settlements, under, the, late, umayyad, and, early, abbasid, caliphs, the, frontier, between, byzantium, and, the, caliphate, became, stabilized, along, the, line, of, the, taurus, antitaurus, mountain, ranges, on, the, arab, side, cilicia, was, permanently, occupied, and, its, deserted, cities, such, as, adana, mopsuestia, al, massisa, and, most, importantly, tarsus, were, refortified, and, resettled, under, the, early, abbasids, likewise, in, upper, mesopotamia, places, like, germanikeia, mar, ash, hadath, and, melitene, malatya, became, major, military, centers, these, two, regions, came, to, form, the, two, halves, of, a, new, fortified, frontier, zone, the, thughur, both, the, umayyads, and, later, the, abbasids, continued, to, regard, the, annual, expeditions, against, the, caliphate, s, traditional, enemy, as, an, integral, part, of, the, continuing, jihad, and, they, quickly, became, organized, in, a, regular, fashion, one, to, two, summer, expeditions, pl, aw, if, sing, ifa, sometimes, accompanied, by, a, naval, attack, and, or, followed, by, winter, expeditions, shaw, t, the, summer, expeditions, were, usually, two, separate, attacks, the, expedition, of, the, left, al, ifa, al, yusr, al, ughr, launched, from, the, cilician, thughur, and, consisting, mostly, of, syrian, troops, and, the, usually, larger, expedition, of, the, right, al, ifa, al, yumn, al, kubr, launched, from, malatya, and, composed, of, mesopotamian, troops, the, raids, were, also, largely, confined, to, the, borderlands, and, the, central, anatolian, plateau, and, only, rarely, reached, the, peripheral, coastlands, which, the, byzantines, fortified, heavily, under, the, more, aggressive, caliph, hisham, ibn, abd, al, malik, r, 723, 743, the, arab, expeditions, intensified, for, a, time, and, were, led, by, some, of, the, caliphate, s, most, capable, generals, including, princes, of, the, umayyad, dynasty, like, maslama, ibn, abd, al, malik, and, al, abbas, ibn, al, walid, or, hisham, s, own, sons, mu, awiyah, maslama, and, sulayman, this, was, still, a, time, when, byzantium, was, fighting, for, survival, and, the, frontier, provinces, devastated, by, war, were, a, land, of, ruined, cities, and, deserted, villages, where, a, scattered, population, looked, to, rocky, castles, or, impenetrable, mountains, rather, than, the, armies, of, the, empire, to, provide, a, minimum, of, security, kennedy, in, response, to, the, renewal, of, arab, invasions, and, to, a, sequence, of, natural, disasters, such, as, the, eruptions, of, the, volcanic, island, of, thera, the, emperor, leo, iii, the, isaurian, concluded, that, the, empire, had, lost, divine, favour, already, in, 722, he, had, tried, to, force, the, conversion, of, the, empire, s, jews, but, soon, he, began, to, turn, his, attention, to, the, veneration, of, icons, which, some, bishops, had, come, to, regard, as, idolatrous, in, 726, leo, published, an, edict, condemning, their, use, and, showed, himself, increasingly, critical, of, the, iconophiles, he, formally, banned, depictions, of, religious, figures, in, a, court, council, in, 730, this, decision, provoked, major, opposition, both, from, the, people, and, the, church, especially, the, bishop, of, rome, which, leo, did, not, take, into, account, in, the, words, of, warren, treadgold, he, saw, no, need, to, consult, the, church, and, he, appears, to, have, been, surprised, by, the, depth, of, the, popular, opposition, he, encountered, the, controversy, weakened, the, byzantine, empire, and, was, a, key, factor, in, the, schism, between, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, and, the, bishop, of, rome, the, umayyad, caliphate, however, was, increasingly, distracted, by, conflicts, elsewhere, especially, its, confrontation, with, the, khazars, with, whom, leo, iii, had, concluded, an, alliance, marrying, his, son, and, heir, constantine, v, r, 741, 775, to, the, khazar, princess, tzitzak, only, in, the, late, 730s, did, the, muslim, raids, again, become, a, threat, but, the, great, byzantine, victory, at, akroinon, and, the, turmoil, of, the, abbasid, revolution, led, to, a, pause, in, arab, attacks, against, the, empire, it, also, opened, up, the, way, for, a, more, aggressive, stance, by, constantine, v, r, 741, 775, who, in, 741, attacked, the, major, arab, base, of, melitene, and, continued, scoring, further, victories, these, successes, were, also, interpreted, by, leo, iii, and, his, son, constantine, as, evidence, of, god, s, renewed, favour, and, strengthened, the, position, of, iconoclasm, within, the, empire, unlike, their, umayyad, predecessors, the, abbasid, caliphs, did, not, pursue, active, expansion, in, general, terms, they, were, content, with, the, territorial, limits, achieved, and, whatever, external, campaigns, they, waged, were, retaliatory, or, preemptive, meant, to, preserve, their, frontier, and, impress, abbasid, might, upon, their, neighbours, at, the, same, time, the, campaigns, against, byzantium, in, particular, remained, important, for, domestic, consumption, the, annual, raids, which, had, almost, lapsed, in, the, turmoil, following, the, abbasid, revolution, were, undertaken, with, renewed, vigour, from, ca, 780, on, and, were, the, only, expeditions, where, the, caliph, or, his, sons, participated, in, person, as, a, symbol, of, the, caliph, s, ritual, role, as, the, leader, of, the, muslim, community, they, were, closely, paralleled, in, official, propaganda, by, the, leadership, by, abbasid, family, members, of, the, annual, pilgrimage, hajj, to, mecca, in, addition, the, constant, warfare, on, the, syrian, marches, was, useful, to, the, abbasids, as, it, provided, employment, for, the, syrian, and, iraqi, military, elites, and, the, various, volunteers, mu, awi, a, who, flocked, to, participate, in, the, jihad, the, thugh, r, are, blocked, by, h, r, n, and, through, him, the, ropes, of, the, muslim, state, are, firmly, plaited, his, banner, is, forever, tied, with, victory, he, has, an, army, before, which, armies, scatter,

emphasize, his, piety, and, role, as, the, leader, of, the, muslim, community, caliph, harun, al, rashid, r, 786, 809, in, particular, was, the, most, energetic, of, the, early, abbasid, rulers, in, his, pursuit, of, warfare, against, byzantium, he, established, his, seat, at, raqqa, close, to, the, frontier, he, complemented, the, thughur, in, 786, by, forming, a, second, defensive, line, along, northern, syria, the, al, awasim, and, was, reputed, to, be, spending, alternating, years, leading, the, hajj, and, leading, a, campaign, into, anatolia, including, the, largest, expedition, assembled, under, the, abbasids, in, 806, continuing, a, trend, started, by, his, immediate, predecessors, his, reign, also, saw, the, development, of, far, more, regular, contacts, between, the, abbasid, court, and, byzantium, with, the, exchange, of, embassies, and, letters, being, far, more, common, than, under, the, umayyad, rulers, despite, harun, s, hostility, the, existence, of, embassies, is, a, sign, that, the, abbasids, accepted, that, the, byzantine, empire, was, a, power, with, which, they, had, to, deal, on, equal, terms, kennedy, civil, war, occurred, in, the, byzantine, empire, often, with, arab, support, with, the, support, of, caliph, al, ma, mun, arabs, under, the, leadership, of, thomas, the, slav, invaded, so, that, within, a, matter, of, months, only, two, themata, in, asia, minor, remained, loyal, to, emperor, michael, ii, when, the, arabs, captured, thessalonica, the, empire, s, second, largest, city, it, was, quickly, re, captured, by, the, byzantines, thomas, s, 821, siege, of, constantinople, did, not, get, past, the, city, walls, and, he, was, forced, to, retreat, the, arabs, did, not, relinquish, their, designs, on, asia, minor, and, in, 838, began, another, invasion, sacking, the, city, of, amorion, while, a, relative, equilibrium, reigned, in, the, east, the, situation, in, the, western, mediterranean, was, irretrievably, altered, when, the, aghlabids, began, their, slow, conquest, of, sicily, in, the, 820s, using, tunisia, as, their, launching, pad, the, arabs, started, by, conquering, palermo, in, 831, messina, in, 842, enna, in, 859, culminating, in, the, capture, of, syracuse, in, 878, separately, in, around, 827, a, band, of, andalusians, expelled, from, alexandria, by, the, abbasids, arrived, in, crete, the, andalusians, established, their, main, city, and, fortress, at, chandax, which, later, became, their, capital, once, they, had, subdued, the, byzantine, territory, establishing, the, emirate, of, crete, in, 863, during, the, reign, of, michael, iii, the, byzantine, general, petronas, defeated, and, routed, an, arab, invasion, force, under, the, command, of, umar, al, aqta, at, the, battle, of, lalakaon, inflicting, heavy, casualties, and, removing, the, emirate, of, melitene, as, a, serious, military, threat, umar, died, in, battle, and, the, remnants, of, his, army, was, annihilated, in, subsequent, clashes, allowing, the, byzantines, to, celebrate, the, victory, as, revenge, for, the, earlier, arab, sacking, of, amorion, while, news, of, the, defeats, sparked, riots, in, baghdad, and, samarra, in, the, following, months, the, byzantines, successfully, invaded, armenia, killing, the, muslim, governor, in, armenia, emir, ali, ibn, yahya, as, well, as, the, paulician, leader, karbeas, these, byzantines, victories, marked, a, turning, point, which, ushered, in, a, century, long, byzantine, offensive, eastward, into, muslim, territory, religious, peace, came, with, the, emergence, of, the, macedonian, dynasty, in, 867, as, well, as, a, strong, and, unified, byzantine, leadership, while, the, abbasid, empire, had, splintered, into, many, factions, after, 861, basil, i, revived, the, byzantine, empire, into, a, regional, power, during, a, period, of, territorial, expansion, making, the, empire, the, strongest, power, in, europe, with, an, ecclesiastical, policy, marked, by, good, relations, with, rome, basil, allied, with, the, holy, roman, emperor, louis, ii, against, the, arabs, and, his, fleet, cleared, the, adriatic, sea, of, their, raids, with, byzantine, help, louis, ii, captured, bari, from, the, arabs, in, 871, the, city, became, byzantine, territory, in, 876, the, byzantine, position, on, sicily, deteriorated, and, syracuse, fell, to, the, emirate, of, sicily, in, 878, catania, was, lost, in, 900, and, finally, the, fortress, of, taormina, in, 902, michael, of, zahumlje, apparently, on, 10, july, 926, sacked, siponto, latin, sipontum, which, was, a, byzantine, town, in, apulia, sicily, would, remain, under, arab, control, until, the, norman, invasion, in, 1071, although, sicily, was, lost, the, general, nikephoros, phokas, the, elder, succeeded, in, taking, taranto, and, much, of, calabria, in, 880, forming, the, nucleus, for, the, later, catepanate, of, italy, the, successes, in, the, italian, peninsula, opened, a, new, period, of, byzantine, domination, there, above, all, the, byzantines, were, beginning, to, establish, a, strong, presence, in, the, mediterranean, sea, and, especially, the, adriatic, under, john, kourkouas, the, byzantines, conquered, the, emirate, of, melitene, along, with, theodosiopolis, the, strongest, of, the, muslim, border, emirates, and, advanced, into, armenia, in, the, 930s, the, next, three, decades, were, dominated, by, the, struggle, of, the, phokas, clan, and, their, dependants, against, the, hamdanid, emir, of, aleppo, sayf, al, dawla, al, dawla, was, finally, defeated, by, nikephoros, ii, phokas, who, conquered, cilicia, and, northern, syria, including, the, sack, of, aleppo, and, recovered, crete, his, nephew, and, successor, john, i, tzimiskes, pushed, even, further, south, almost, reaching, jerusalem, but, his, death, in, 976, ended, byzantine, expansion, towards, palestine, after, putting, an, end, to, the, internal, strife, basil, ii, launched, a, counter, campaign, against, the, arabs, in, 995, the, byzantine, civil, wars, had, weakened, the, empire, s, position, in, the, east, and, the, gains, of, nikephoros, ii, phokas, and, john, i, tzimiskes, came, close, to, being, lost, with, aleppo, besieged, and, antioch, under, threat, basil, won, several, battles, in, syria, relieving, aleppo, taking, over, the, orontes, valley, and, raiding, further, south, although, he, did, not, have, the, force, to, drive, into, palestine, and, reclaim, jerusalem, his, victories, did, restore, much, of, syria, to, the, empire, including, the, larger, city, of, antioch, which, was, the, seat, of, its, eponymous, patriarch, no, byzantine, emperor, since, heraclius, had, been, able, to, hold, these, lands, for, any, length, of, time, and, the, empire, would, retain, them, for, the, next, 110, years, until, 1078, piers, paul, read, writes, that, by, 1025, byzantine, land, stretched, from, the, straits, of, messina, and, the, northern, adriatic, in, the, west, to, the, river, danube, and, crimea, in, the, north, and, to, the, cities, of, melitene, and, edessa, beyond, the, euphrates, in, the, east, under, basil, ii, the, byzantines, established, a, swath, of, new, themata, stretching, northeast, from, aleppo, a, byzantine, protectorate, to, manzikert, under, the, theme, system, of, military, and, administrative, government, the, byzantines, could, raise, a, force, at, least, 200, 000, strong, though, in, practice, these, were, strategically, placed, throughout, the, empire, with, basil, s, rule, the, byzantine, empire, reached, its, greatest, height, in, nearly, five, centuries, and, indeed, for, the, next, four, centuries, the, wars, drew, near, to, a, closure, when, the, turks, and, various, mongol, invaders, replaced, the, threat, of, either, power, from, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, onwards, the, byzantine, conflicts, shifted, into, the, byzantine, seljuk, wars, with, the, continuing, islamic, invasion, of, anatolia, being, taken, over, by, the, seljuk, turks, after, the, defeat, at, the, battle, of, manzikert, by, the, turks, in, 1071, the, byzantine, empire, with, the, help, of, western, crusaders, re, established, its, position, in, the, middle, east, as, a, major, power, meanwhile, the, major, arab, conflicts, were, in, the, crusades, and, later, against, mongolian, invasions, especially, that, of, the, ilkhanate, and, timur, as, with, any, war, of, such, length, the, drawn, out, byzantine, arab, wars, had, long, lasting, effects, for, both, the, byzantine, empire, and, the, arab, world, the, byzantines, experienced, extensive, territorial, loss, however, while, the, invading, arabs, gained, strong, control, in, the, middle, east, and, africa, further, conquests, in, western, asia, were, halted, the, focus, of, the, byzantine, empire, shifted, from, the, western, reconquests, of, justinian, to, a, primarily, defensive, position, against, the, islamic, armies, on, its, eastern, borders, without, byzantine, interference, in, the, emerging, christian, states, of, western, europe, the, situation, gave, a, huge, stimulus, to, feudalism, and, economic, self, sufficiency, the, view, of, modern, historians, is, that, one, of, the, most, important, effects, was, the, strain, it, put, on, the, relationship, between, rome, and, byzantium, while, fighting, for, survival, against, the, islamic, armies, the, empire, was, no, longer, able, to, provide, the, protection, it, had, once, offered, to, the, papacy, worse, still, according, to, thomas, woods, the, emperors, routinely, intervened, in, the, life, of, the, church, in, areas, lying, clearly, beyond, the, state, s, competence, the, iconoclast, controversy, of, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, can, be, taken, as, a, key, factor, which, drove, the, latin, church, into, the, arms, of, the, franks, thus, it, has, been, argued, that, charlemagne, was, an, indirect, product, of, muhammad, the, holy, roman, empire, of, charlemagne, s, successors, would, later, come, to, the, aid, of, the, byzantines, under, louis, ii, and, during, the, crusades, but, relations, between, the, two, empires, would, be, strained, based, on, the, salerno, chronicle, we, know, the, emperor, basil, had, sent, an, angry, letter, to, his, western, counterpart, reprimanding, him, for, usurping, the, title, of, emperor, walter, emil, kaegi, states, that, extant, arabic, sources, have, been, given, much, scholarly, attention, for, issues, of, obscurities, and, contradictions, however, he, points, out, that, byzantine, sources, are, also, problematic, such, as, the, chronicles, of, theophanes, and, nicephorus, and, those, written, in, syriac, which, are, short, and, terse, while, the, important, question, of, their, sources, and, their, use, of, sources, remains, unresolved, kaegi, concludes, that, scholars, must, also, subject, the, byzantine, tradition, to, critical, scrutiny, as, it, contains, bias, and, cannot, serve, as, an, objective, standard, against, which, all, muslim, sources, may, be, confidently, checked, among, the, few, latin, sources, of, interest, are, the, 7th, century, history, of, fredegarius, and, two, 8th, century, spanish, chronicles, all, of, which, draw, on, some, byzantine, and, oriental, historical, traditions, as, far, as, byzantine, military, action, against, the, initial, muslim, invasions, kaegi, asserts, that, byzantine, traditions, attempt, to, deflect, criticism, of, the, byzantine, debacle, from, heraclius, to, other, persons, groups, and, things, the, range, of, non, historical, byzantine, sources, is, vast, they, range, from, papyri, to, sermons, most, notable, those, of, sophronius, and, anastasius, sinaita, poetry, especially, that, of, sophronius, and, george, of, pisidia, including, the, acritic, songs, correspondence, often, of, a, patristic, provenance, apologetical, treatises, apocalypses, hagiography, military, manuals, in, particular, the, strategikon, of, maurice, from, the, beginning, of, the, 7th, century, and, other, non, literary, sources, such, as, epigraphy, archeology, and, numismatics, none, of, these, sources, contains, a, coherent, account, of, any, of, the, campaigns, and, conquests, of, the, muslim, armies, but, some, do, contain, invaluable, details, that, survive, nowhere, else
