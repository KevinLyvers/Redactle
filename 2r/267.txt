annam, in, northern, vietnam, had, been, incorporated, into, the, chinese, empire, over, 600, years, earlier, during, the, han, dynasty, 202, bc, 220, ad, however, the, kingdom, of, champa, in, central, vietnam, became, a, major, counterpart, to, chinese, invasions, to, its, north, according, to, ebrey, walthall, and, palais, these, invasions, became, known, as, the, linyi, champa, campaign, 602, 605, the, hanoi, area, formerly, held, by, the, han, and, jin, dynasties, was, easily, retaken, from, the, early, l, dynasty, ruler, l, ph, t, t, in, 602, a, few, years, later, the, sui, army, pushed, farther, south, and, was, attacked, by, troops, on, war, elephants, from, champa, in, southern, vietnam, the, sui, army, feigned, retreat, and, dug, pits, to, trap, the, elephants, lured, the, champan, troops, to, attack, then, used, crossbows, against, the, elephants, causing, them, to, turn, around, and, trample, their, own, soldiers, although, sui, troops, were, victorious, many, succumbed, to, disease, as, northern, soldiers, did, not, have, immunity, to, tropical, diseases, such, as, malaria, the, sui, dynasty, led, a, series, of, massive, expeditions, to, invade, goguryeo, one, of, the, three, kingdoms, of, korea, emperor, yang, conscripted, many, soldiers, for, the, campaign, this, army, was, so, enormous, it, recorded, in, historical, texts, that, it, took, 30, days, for, all, the, armies, to, exit, their, last, rallying, point, near, shanhaiguan, before, invading, goguryeo, in, one, instance, the, soldiers, both, conscripted, and, paid, listed, over, 3000, warships, up, to, 1, 15, million, infantry, 50, 000, cavalry, 5000, artillery, and, more, the, army, stretched, to, 1000, li, or, about, 410, km, 250, mi, across, rivers, and, valleys, over, mountains, and, hills, each, of, the, four, military, expeditions, ended, in, failure, incurring, a, substantial, financial, and, manpower, deficit, from, which, the, sui, would, never, recover, one, of, the, major, work, projects, undertaken, by, the, sui, was, construction, activities, along, the, great, wall, of, china, but, this, along, with, other, large, projects, strained, the, economy, and, angered, the, resentful, workforce, employed, during, the, last, few, years, of, the, sui, dynasty, the, rebellion, that, rose, against, it, took, many, of, china, s, able, bodied, men, from, rural, farms, and, other, occupations, which, in, turn, damaged, the, agricultural, base, and, the, economy, further, men, would, deliberately, break, their, limbs, in, order, to, avoid, military, conscription, calling, the, practice, propitious, paws, and, fortunate, feet, later, after, the, fall, of, sui, in, the, year, 642, emperor, taizong, of, tang, made, an, effort, to, eradicate, this, practice, by, issuing, a, decree, of, a, stiffer, punishment, for, those, who, were, found, to, deliberately, injure, and, heal, themselves, although, the, sui, dynasty, was, relatively, short, 581, 618, much, was, accomplished, during, its, tenure, the, grand, canal, was, one, of, the, main, accomplishments, it, was, extended, north, from, the, hangzhou, region, across, the, yangtze, to, yangzhou, and, then, northwest, to, the, region, of, luoyang, again, like, the, great, wall, works, the, massive, conscription, of, labour, and, allocation, of, resources, for, the, grand, canal, project, resulted, in, challenges, for, sui, dynastic, continuity, the, eventual, fall, of, the, sui, dynasty, was, also, due, to, the, many, losses, caused, by, the, failed, military, campaigns, against, goguryeo, it, was, after, these, defeats, and, losses, that, the, country, was, left, in, ruins, and, rebels, soon, took, control, of, the, government, emperor, yang, was, assassinated, in, 618, he, had, gone, south, after, the, capital, being, threatened, by, various, rebel, groups, and, was, killed, by, his, yuwen, clan, advisors, meanwhile, in, the, north, the, aristocrat, li, yuan, held, an, uprising, after, which, he, ended, up, ascending, the, throne, to, become, emperor, gaozu, of, tang, there, were, dukedoms, for, the, offspring, of, the, royal, families, of, the, zhou, dynasty, sui, dynasty, and, tang, dynasty, in, the, later, jin, five, dynasties, this, practice, was, referred, to, as, rw, ng, s, nk, although, the, sui, dynasty, was, relatively, short, lived, in, terms, of, culture, it, represents, a, transition, from, the, preceding, ages, and, many, cultural, developments, which, can, be, seen, to, be, incipient, during, the, sui, dynasty, later, were, expanded, and, consolidated, during, the, ensuing, tang, dynasty, and, later, ages, this, includes, not, only, the, major, public, works, initiated, such, as, the, great, wall, and, the, great, canal, but, also, the, political, system, developed, by, sui, which, was, adopted, by, tang, with, little, initial, change, other, than, at, the, top, of, the, political, hierarchy, other, cultural, developments, of, the, sui, dynasty, included, religion, and, literature, particular, examples, being, buddhism, and, poetry, rituals, and, sacrifices, were, conducted, by, the, sui, the, sui, court, pursued, a, pro, taoist, policy, the, first, reign, of, the, dynasty, saw, the, state, promoting, the, northern, louguan, school, of, taoism, while, the, second, reign, instead, promoted, the, southern, shangqing, school, of, taoism, possibly, due, to, emperor, yang, s, preference, for, southern, culture, buddhism, was, popular, during, the, sixteen, kingdoms, and, northern, and, southern, dynasties, period, that, preceded, the, sui, dynasty, spreading, from, india, through, kushan, afghanistan, into, china, during, the, late, han, period, buddhism, gained, prominence, during, the, period, when, central, political, control, was, limited, buddhism, created, a, unifying, cultural, force, that, uplifted, the, people, out, of, war, and, into, the, sui, dynasty, in, many, ways, buddhism, was, responsible, for, the, rebirth, of, culture, in, china, under, the, sui, dynasty, while, early, buddhist, teachings, were, acquired, from, sanskrit, sutras, it, was, during, the, late, six, dynasties, and, sui, dynasty, that, local, chinese, schools, of, buddhist, thoughts, started, to, flourish, most, notably, zhiyi, founded, the, tiantai, school, and, completed, the, great, treatise, on, concentration, and, insight, within, which, he, taught, the, principle, of, three, thousand, realms, in, a, single, moment, of, life, as, the, essence, of, buddhist, teaching, outlined, in, the, lotus, sutra, emperor, wen, and, his, empress, had, converted, to, buddhism, to, legitimise, imperial, authority, over, china, and, the, conquest, of, chen, the, emperor, presented, himself, as, a, cakravartin, king, a, buddhist, monarch, who, would, use, military, force, to, defend, the, buddhist, faith, in, the, year, 601, ad, emperor, wen, had, relics, of, the, buddha, distributed, to, temples, throughout, china, with, edicts, that, expressed, his, goals, all, the, people, within, the, four, seas, may, without, exception, develop, enlightenment, and, together, cultivate, fortunate, karma, bringing, it, to, pass, that, present, existences, will, lead, to, happy, future, lives, that, the, sustained, creation, of, good, causation, will, carry, us, one, and, all, up, to, wondrous, enlightenment, 89, ultimately, this, act, was, an, imitation, of, the, ancient, mauryan, emperor, ashoka, of, india, 89, confucian, philosopher, wang, tong, wrote, and, taught, during, the, sui, dynasty, and, even, briefly, held, office, as, secretary, of, shuzhou, his, most, famous, as, well, as, only, surviving, work, the, explanation, of, the, mean, zhongshuo, was, compiled, shortly, after, his, death, in, 617, although, poetry, continued, to, be, written, and, certain, poets, rose, in, prominence, while, others, disappeared, from, the, landscape, the, brief, sui, dynasty, in, terms, of, the, development, of, chinese, poetry, lacks, distinction, though, it, nonetheless, represents, a, continuity, between, the, six, dynasties, and, the, poetry, of, tang, sui, dynasty, poets, include, yang, guang, 580, 618, who, was, the, last, sui, emperor, and, a, sort, of, poetry, critic, and, also, the, lady, hou, one, of, his, consorts
