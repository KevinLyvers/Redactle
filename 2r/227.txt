in, the, history, of, the, americas, the, pre, columbian, era, also, known, as, the, pre, contact, era, spans, from, the, initial, peopling, of, the, americas, in, the, upper, paleolithic, to, the, onset, of, european, colonization, which, began, with, christopher, columbus, s, voyage, in, 1492, this, era, encompasses, the, history, of, indigenous, cultures, prior, to, significant, european, influence, which, in, some, cases, did, not, occur, until, decades, or, even, centuries, after, columbus, s, arrival, during, the, pre, columbian, era, many, civilizations, developed, permanent, settlements, cities, agricultural, practices, civic, and, monumental, architecture, major, earthworks, and, complex, societal, hierarchies, some, of, these, civilizations, had, declined, by, the, time, of, the, establishment, of, the, first, permanent, european, colonies, around, the, late, 16th, to, early, 17th, centuries, and, are, known, primarily, through, archaeological, research, of, the, americas, and, oral, histories, other, civilizations, contemporaneous, with, the, colonial, period, were, documented, in, european, accounts, of, the, time, for, instance, the, maya, civilization, maintained, written, records, which, were, often, destroyed, by, christian, europeans, such, as, diego, de, landa, who, viewed, them, as, pagan, but, sought, to, preserve, native, histories, despite, the, destruction, a, few, original, documents, have, survived, and, others, were, transcribed, or, translated, into, spanish, providing, modern, historians, with, valuable, insights, into, ancient, cultures, and, knowledge, before, the, development, of, archaeology, in, the, 19th, century, historians, of, the, pre, columbian, period, mainly, interpreted, the, records, of, the, european, conquerors, and, the, accounts, of, early, european, travelers, and, antiquaries, it, was, not, until, the, nineteenth, century, that, the, work, of, people, such, as, john, lloyd, stephens, eduard, seler, and, alfred, maudslay, and, institutions, such, as, the, peabody, museum, of, archaeology, and, ethnology, of, harvard, university, led, to, the, reconsideration, and, criticism, of, the, early, european, sources, now, the, scholarly, study, of, pre, columbian, cultures, is, most, often, based, on, scientific, and, multidisciplinary, methodologies, the, haplogroup, most, commonly, associated, with, indigenous, amerindian, genetics, is, y, chromosome, haplogroup, q1a3a, researchers, have, found, genetic, evidence, that, the, q1a3a, haplogroup, has, been, in, south, america, since, at, least, 18, 000, bce, y, chromosome, dna, like, mtdna, differs, from, other, nuclear, chromosomes, in, that, the, majority, of, the, y, chromosome, is, unique, and, does, not, recombine, during, meiosis, this, has, the, effect, that, the, historical, pattern, of, mutations, can, easily, be, studied, the, pattern, indicates, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, experienced, two, very, distinctive, genetic, episodes, first, with, the, initial, peopling, of, the, americas, and, second, with, european, colonization, of, the, americas, the, former, is, the, determinant, factor, for, the, number, of, gene, lineages, and, founding, haplotypes, present, in, today, s, indigenous, populations, human, settlement, of, the, americas, occurred, in, stages, from, the, bering, sea, coastline, with, an, initial, 20, 000, year, layover, on, beringia, for, the, founding, population, the, microsatellite, diversity, and, distributions, of, the, y, lineage, specific, to, south, america, indicate, that, certain, amerindian, populations, have, been, isolated, since, the, initial, colonization, of, the, region, the, na, den, inuit, and, indigenous, alaskan, populations, exhibit, haplogroup, q, m242, y, dna, mutations, however, and, are, distinct, from, other, indigenous, peoples, with, various, mtdna, mutations, this, suggests, that, the, earliest, migrants, into, the, northern, extremes, of, north, america, and, greenland, derived, from, later, populations, asian, nomadic, paleo, indians, are, thought, to, have, entered, the, americas, via, the, bering, land, bridge, beringia, now, the, bering, strait, and, possibly, along, the, coast, genetic, evidence, found, in, indigenous, peoples, maternally, inherited, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, supports, the, theory, of, multiple, genetic, populations, migrating, from, asia, after, crossing, the, land, bridge, they, moved, southward, along, the, pacific, coast, and, through, an, interior, ice, free, corridor, throughout, millennia, paleo, indians, spread, throughout, the, rest, of, north, and, south, america, exactly, when, the, first, people, migrated, into, the, americas, is, the, subject, of, much, debate, one, of, the, earliest, identifiable, cultures, was, the, clovis, culture, with, sites, dating, from, some, 13, 000, years, ago, however, older, sites, dating, back, to, 20, 000, years, ago, have, been, claimed, some, genetic, studies, estimate, the, colonization, of, the, americas, dates, from, between, 40, 000, and, 13, 000, years, ago, the, chronology, of, migration, models, is, currently, divided, into, two, general, approaches, the, first, is, the, short, chronology, theory, with, the, first, movement, beyond, alaska, into, the, americas, occurring, no, earlier, than, 14, 000, 17, 000, years, ago, followed, by, successive, waves, of, immigrants, the, second, belief, is, the, long, chronology, theory, which, proposes, that, the, first, group, of, people, entered, the, hemisphere, at, a, much, earlier, date, possibly, 50, 000, 40, 000, years, ago, or, earlier, artifacts, have, been, found, in, both, north, and, south, america, which, have, been, dated, to, 14, 000, years, ago, and, accordingly, humans, have, been, proposed, to, have, reached, cape, horn, at, the, southern, tip, of, south, america, by, this, time, in, that, case, the, inuit, would, have, arrived, separately, and, at, a, much, later, date, probably, no, more, than, 2, 000, years, ago, moving, across, the, ice, from, siberia, into, alaska, the, north, american, climate, was, unstable, as, the, ice, age, receded, during, the, lithic, stage, it, finally, stabilized, about, 10, 000, years, ago, climatic, conditions, were, then, very, similar, to, today, s, within, this, time, frame, roughly, about, the, archaic, period, numerous, archaeological, cultures, have, been, identified, the, unstable, climate, led, to, widespread, migration, with, early, paleo, indians, soon, spreading, throughout, the, americas, diversifying, into, many, hundreds, of, culturally, distinct, tribes, the, paleo, indians, were, hunter, gatherers, likely, characterized, by, small, mobile, bands, consisting, of, approximately, 20, to, 50, members, of, an, extended, family, these, groups, moved, from, place, to, place, as, preferred, resources, were, depleted, and, new, supplies, were, sought, during, much, of, the, paleo, indian, period, bands, are, thought, to, have, subsisted, primarily, through, hunting, now, extinct, giant, land, animals, such, as, mastodon, and, ancient, bison, paleo, indian, groups, carried, a, variety, of, tools, including, distinctive, projectile, points, and, knives, as, well, as, less, distinctive, butchering, and, hide, scraping, implements, the, vastness, of, the, north, american, continent, and, the, variety, of, its, climates, ecology, vegetation, fauna, and, landforms, led, ancient, peoples, to, coalesce, into, many, distinct, linguistic, and, cultural, groups, this, is, reflected, in, the, oral, histories, of, the, indigenous, peoples, described, by, a, wide, range, of, traditional, creation, stories, which, often, say, that, a, given, people, have, been, living, in, a, certain, territory, since, the, creation, of, the, world, throughout, thousands, of, years, paleo, indian, people, domesticated, bred, and, cultivated, many, plant, species, including, crops, that, now, constitute, 50, 60, of, worldwide, agriculture, in, general, arctic, subarctic, and, coastal, peoples, continued, to, live, as, hunters, and, gatherers, while, agriculture, was, adopted, in, more, temperate, and, sheltered, regions, permitting, a, dramatic, rise, in, population, after, the, migration, or, migrations, it, was, several, thousand, years, before, the, first, complex, societies, arose, the, earliest, emerging, about, seven, to, eight, thousand, years, ago, as, early, as, 5500, bce, people, in, the, lower, mississippi, valley, at, monte, sano, and, other, sites, in, present, day, louisiana, mississippi, and, florida, were, building, complex, earthwork, mounds, probably, for, religious, purposes, beginning, in, the, late, twentieth, century, archeologists, have, studied, analyzed, and, dated, these, sites, realizing, that, the, earliest, complexes, were, built, by, hunter, gatherer, societies, whose, people, occupied, the, sites, on, a, seasonal, basis, watson, brake, a, large, complex, of, eleven, platform, mounds, was, constructed, beginning, in, 3400, bce, and, added, to, over, 500, years, this, has, changed, earlier, assumptions, that, complex, construction, arose, only, after, societies, had, adopted, agriculture, and, become, sedentary, with, stratified, hierarchy, and, usually, ceramics, these, ancient, people, had, organized, to, build, complex, mound, projects, under, a, different, social, structure, until, the, accurate, dating, of, watson, brake, and, similar, sites, the, oldest, mound, complex, was, thought, to, be, poverty, point, also, located, in, the, lower, mississippi, valley, built, about, 1500, bce, it, is, the, centerpiece, of, a, culture, extending, over, 100, sites, on, both, sides, of, the, mississippi, the, poverty, point, site, has, earthworks, in, the, form, of, six, concentric, half, circles, divided, by, radial, aisles, together, with, some, mounds, the, entire, complex, is, nearly, a, mile, across, mound, building, was, continued, by, succeeding, cultures, who, built, numerous, sites, in, the, middle, mississippi, and, ohio, river, valleys, as, well, adding, effigy, mounds, conical, and, ridge, mounds, and, other, shapes, the, woodland, period, of, north, american, pre, columbian, cultures, lasted, from, roughly, 1000, bce, to, 1000, ce, the, term, was, coined, in, the, 1930s, and, refers, to, prehistoric, sites, between, the, archaic, period, and, the, mississippian, cultures, the, adena, culture, and, the, ensuing, hopewell, tradition, during, this, period, built, monumental, earthwork, architecture, and, established, continent, spanning, trade, and, exchange, networks, this, period, is, considered, a, developmental, stage, without, any, massive, changes, in, a, short, period, but, instead, has, a, continuous, development, in, stone, and, bone, tools, leatherworking, textile, manufacture, tool, production, cultivation, and, shelter, construction, some, woodland, people, continued, to, use, spears, and, atlatls, until, the, end, of, the, period, when, they, were, replaced, by, bows, and, arrows, the, mississippian, culture, was, spread, across, the, southeast, and, midwest, of, what, is, today, the, united, states, from, the, atlantic, coast, to, the, edge, of, the, plains, from, the, gulf, of, mexico, to, the, upper, midwest, although, most, intensively, in, the, area, along, the, mississippi, river, and, ohio, river, one, of, the, distinguishing, features, of, this, culture, was, the, construction, of, complexes, of, large, earthen, mounds, and, grand, plazas, continuing, the, mound, building, traditions, of, earlier, cultures, they, grew, maize, and, other, crops, intensively, participated, in, an, extensive, trade, network, and, had, a, complex, stratified, society, the, mississippians, first, appeared, around, 1000, ce, following, and, developing, out, of, the, less, agriculturally, intensive, and, less, centralized, woodland, period, the, largest, urban, site, of, these, people, cahokia, located, near, modern, east, st, louis, illinois, may, have, reached, a, population, of, over, 20, 000, other, chiefdoms, were, constructed, throughout, the, southeast, and, its, trade, networks, reached, to, the, great, lakes, and, the, gulf, of, mexico, at, its, peak, between, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, cahokia, was, the, most, populous, city, in, north, america, larger, cities, did, exist, in, mesoamerica, and, the, andes, monks, mound, the, major, ceremonial, center, of, cahokia, remains, the, largest, earthen, construction, of, the, prehistoric, americas, the, culture, reached, its, peak, in, about, 1200, 1400, ce, and, in, most, places, it, seems, to, have, been, in, decline, before, the, arrival, of, europeans, many, mississippian, peoples, were, encountered, by, the, expedition, of, hernando, de, soto, in, the, 1540s, mostly, with, disastrous, results, for, both, sides, unlike, the, spanish, expeditions, in, mesoamerica, which, conquered, vast, empires, with, relatively, few, men, the, de, soto, expedition, wandered, the, american, southeast, for, four, years, becoming, more, bedraggled, losing, more, men, and, equipment, and, eventually, arriving, in, mexico, as, a, fraction, of, its, original, size, the, local, people, fared, much, worse, though, as, the, fatalities, of, diseases, introduced, by, the, expedition, devastated, the, populations, and, produced, much, social, disruption, by, the, time, europeans, returned, a, hundred, years, later, nearly, all, of, the, mississippian, groups, had, vanished, and, vast, swaths, of, their, territory, were, virtually, uninhabited, the, ancestral, puebloans, thrived, in, what, is, now, the, four, corners, region, in, the, united, states, it, is, commonly, suggested, that, the, culture, of, the, ancestral, puebloans, emerged, during, the, early, basketmaker, ii, era, during, the, 12th, century, bce, the, ancestral, puebloans, were, a, complex, oasisamerican, society, that, constructed, kivas, multi, story, houses, and, apartment, blocks, made, from, stone, and, adobe, such, as, the, cliff, palace, of, mesa, verde, national, park, in, colorado, and, the, great, houses, in, chaco, canyon, new, mexico, the, puebloans, also, constructed, a, road, system, that, stretched, from, chaco, canyon, to, kutz, canyon, in, the, san, juan, basin, the, ancestral, puebloans, are, also, known, as, anasazi, though, the, term, is, controversial, as, the, present, day, pueblo, peoples, consider, the, term, to, be, derogatory, due, to, the, word, tracing, its, origins, to, a, navajo, word, meaning, ancestor, enemies, the, hohokam, thrived, in, the, sonoran, desert, in, what, is, now, the, u, s, state, of, arizona, and, the, mexican, state, of, sonora, the, hohokam, were, responsible, for, the, construction, of, a, series, of, irrigation, canals, that, led, to, the, successful, establishment, of, phoenix, arizona, via, the, salt, river, project, the, hohokam, also, established, complex, settlements, such, as, snaketown, which, served, as, an, important, commercial, trading, center, after, 1375, ce, hohokam, society, collapsed, and, the, people, abandoned, their, settlements, likely, due, to, drought, the, mogollon, resided, in, the, present, day, states, of, arizona, new, mexico, and, texas, as, well, as, sonora, and, chihuahua, like, most, other, cultures, in, oasisamerica, the, mogollon, constructed, sophisticated, kivas, and, cliff, dwellings, in, the, village, of, paquim, the, mogollon, are, revealed, to, have, housed, pens, for, scarlet, macaws, which, were, introduced, from, mesoamerica, through, trade, the, sinagua, were, hunter, gatherers, and, agriculturalists, who, lived, in, central, arizona, like, the, hohokam, they, constructed, kivas, and, great, houses, as, well, as, ballcourts, several, of, the, sinagua, ruins, include, montezuma, castle, wupatki, and, tuzigoot, the, salado, resided, in, the, tonto, basin, in, southeastern, arizona, from, 1150, ce, to, the, 15th, century, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, they, traded, with, far, away, cultures, as, evidenced, by, the, presence, of, seashells, from, the, gulf, of, california, and, macaw, feathers, from, mexico, most, of, the, cliff, dwellings, constructed, by, the, salado, are, primarily, located, in, tonto, national, monument, the, iroquois, league, of, nations, or, people, of, the, long, house, was, a, politically, advanced, democratic, society, which, is, thought, by, some, historians, to, have, influenced, the, united, states, constitution, with, the, senate, passing, a, resolution, to, this, effect, in, 1988, other, historians, have, contested, this, interpretation, and, believe, the, impact, was, minimal, or, did, not, exist, pointing, to, numerous, differences, between, the, two, systems, and, the, ample, precedents, for, the, constitution, in, european, political, thought, the, calusa, were, a, complex, paramountcy, kingdom, that, resided, in, southern, florida, instead, of, agriculture, the, calusa, economy, relied, on, abundant, fishing, according, to, spanish, sources, the, king, s, house, at, mound, key, was, large, enough, to, house, 2, 000, people, the, calusa, ultimately, collapsed, into, extinction, at, around, 1750, after, succumbing, to, diseases, introduced, by, the, spanish, colonists, the, wichita, people, were, a, loose, confederation, that, consisted, of, sedentary, agriculturalists, and, hunter, gatherers, who, resided, in, the, eastern, great, plains, they, lived, in, permanent, settlements, and, even, established, a, city, called, etzanoa, which, had, a, population, of, 20, 000, people, the, city, was, eventually, abandoned, around, the, 18th, century, after, it, was, encountered, by, spanish, conquistadors, jusepe, gutierrez, and, juan, de, o, ate, when, the, europeans, arrived, indigenous, peoples, of, north, america, had, a, wide, range, of, lifeways, from, sedentary, agrarian, societies, to, semi, nomadic, hunter, gatherer, societies, many, formed, new, tribes, or, confederations, in, response, to, european, colonization, these, are, often, classified, by, cultural, regions, loosely, based, on, geography, these, can, include, the, following, numerous, pre, columbian, societies, were, sedentary, such, as, the, tlingit, haida, chumash, mandan, hidatsa, and, others, and, some, established, large, settlements, even, cities, such, as, cahokia, in, what, is, now, illinois, mesoamerica, is, the, region, extending, from, central, mexico, south, to, the, northwestern, border, of, costa, rica, that, gave, rise, to, a, group, of, stratified, culturally, related, agrarian, civilizations, spanning, an, approximately, 3, 000, year, period, before, the, visits, to, the, caribbean, by, christopher, columbus, mesoamerican, is, the, adjective, generally, used, to, refer, to, that, group, of, pre, columbian, cultures, this, refers, to, an, environmental, area, occupied, by, an, assortment, of, ancient, cultures, that, shared, religious, beliefs, art, architecture, and, technology, in, the, americas, for, more, than, three, thousand, years, between, 2000, and, 300, bce, complex, cultures, began, to, form, in, mesoamerica, some, matured, into, advanced, pre, columbian, mesoamerican, civilizations, such, as, the, olmec, teotihuacan, mayas, zapotecs, mixtecs, huastecs, purepecha, toltecs, and, mexica, aztecs, the, mexica, civilization, is, also, known, as, the, aztec, triple, alliance, since, they, were, three, smaller, kingdoms, loosely, united, together, these, indigenous, civilizations, are, credited, with, many, inventions, building, pyramid, temples, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, writing, highly, accurate, calendars, fine, arts, intensive, agriculture, engineering, an, abacus, calculator, and, complex, theology, they, also, invented, the, wheel, but, it, was, used, solely, as, a, toy, in, addition, they, used, native, copper, silver, and, gold, for, metalworking, archaic, inscriptions, on, rocks, and, rock, walls, all, over, northern, mexico, especially, in, the, state, of, nuevo, le, n, demonstrate, an, early, propensity, for, counting, their, number, system, was, base, 20, and, included, zero, these, early, count, markings, were, associated, with, astronomical, events, and, underscore, the, influence, that, astronomical, activities, had, upon, mesoamerican, people, before, the, arrival, of, europeans, many, of, the, later, mesoamerican, civilizations, carefully, built, their, cities, and, ceremonial, centers, according, to, specific, astronomical, events, the, biggest, mesoamerican, cities, such, as, teotihuacan, tenochtitlan, and, cholula, were, among, the, largest, in, the, world, these, cities, grew, as, centers, of, commerce, ideas, ceremonies, and, theology, and, they, radiated, influence, outwards, onto, neighboring, cultures, in, central, mexico, while, many, city, states, kingdoms, and, empires, competed, with, one, another, for, power, and, prestige, mesoamerica, can, be, said, to, have, had, five, major, civilizations, the, olmecs, teotihuacan, the, toltecs, the, mexica, and, the, mayas, these, civilizations, except, for, the, politically, fragmented, maya, extended, their, reach, across, mesoamerica, and, beyond, like, no, others, they, consolidated, power, and, distributed, influence, in, matters, of, trade, art, politics, technology, and, theology, other, regional, power, players, made, economic, and, political, alliances, with, these, civilizations, over, 4, 000, years, many, made, war, with, them, but, almost, all, peoples, found, themselves, within, one, of, their, spheres, of, influence, regional, communications, in, ancient, mesoamerica, have, been, the, subject, of, considerable, research, there, is, evidence, of, trade, routes, starting, as, far, north, as, the, mexico, central, plateau, and, going, down, to, the, pacific, coast, these, trade, routes, and, cultural, contacts, then, went, on, as, far, as, central, america, these, networks, operated, with, various, interruptions, from, pre, olmec, times, and, up, to, the, late, classical, period, 600, 900, ce, the, earliest, known, civilization, in, mesoamerica, is, the, olmec, this, civilization, established, the, cultural, blueprint, by, which, all, succeeding, indigenous, civilizations, would, follow, in, mexico, pre, olmec, civilization, began, with, the, production, of, pottery, in, abundance, around, 2300, bce, in, the, grijalva, river, delta, between, 1600, and, 1500, bce, the, olmec, civilization, had, begun, with, the, consolidation, of, power, at, their, capital, a, site, today, known, as, san, lorenzo, tenochtitl, n, near, the, coast, in, southeast, veracruz, the, olmec, influence, extended, across, mexico, into, central, america, and, along, the, gulf, of, mexico, they, transformed, many, peoples, thinking, toward, a, new, way, of, government, pyramid, temples, writing, astronomy, art, mathematics, economics, and, religion, their, achievements, paved, the, way, for, the, maya, civilization, and, the, civilizations, in, central, mexico, the, decline, of, the, olmec, resulted, in, a, power, vacuum, in, mexico, emerging, from, that, vacuum, was, teotihuacan, first, settled, in, 300, bce, by, 150, ce, teotihuacan, had, risen, to, become, the, first, true, metropolis, of, what, is, now, called, north, america, teotihuacan, established, a, new, economic, and, political, order, never, before, seen, in, mexico, its, influence, stretched, across, mexico, into, central, america, founding, new, dynasties, in, the, maya, cities, of, tikal, copan, and, kaminaljuy, teotihuacan, s, influence, over, the, maya, civilization, cannot, be, overstated, it, transformed, political, power, artistic, depictions, and, the, nature, of, economics, within, the, city, of, teotihuacan, was, a, diverse, and, cosmopolitan, population, most, of, the, regional, ethnicities, of, mexico, were, represented, in, the, city, such, as, zapotecs, from, the, oaxaca, region, they, lived, in, apartment, communities, where, they, worked, their, trades, and, contributed, to, the, city, s, economic, and, cultural, prowess, teotihuacan, s, economic, pull, impacted, areas, in, northern, mexico, as, well, it, was, a, city, whose, monumental, architecture, reflected, a, monumental, new, era, in, mexican, civilization, declining, in, political, power, about, 650, ce, but, lasting, in, cultural, influence, for, the, better, part, of, a, millennium, to, around, 950, ce, contemporary, teotihuacan, s, greatness, was, that, of, the, maya, civilization, the, period, between, 250, ce, and, 650, ce, was, a, time, of, intense, flourishing, of, maya, civilized, accomplishments, while, the, many, maya, city, states, never, achieved, political, unity, on, the, order, of, the, central, mexican, civilizations, they, exerted, tremendous, intellectual, influence, upon, mexico, and, central, america, the, maya, built, some, of, the, most, elaborate, cities, on, the, continent, and, made, innovations, in, mathematics, astronomy, and, calendrics, the, maya, also, developed, the, only, true, writing, system, native, to, the, americas, using, pictographs, and, syllabic, elements, in, the, form, of, texts, and, codices, inscribed, on, stone, pottery, wood, or, perishable, books, made, from, bark, paper, the, huastecs, were, a, maya, ethnic, group, that, migrated, northwards, to, the, gulf, coast, of, mexico, the, huastecs, are, considered, to, be, distinct, from, the, maya, civilization, as, they, separated, from, the, main, maya, branch, at, around, 2000, bce, and, did, not, possess, the, maya, script, other, accounts, also, suggest, that, the, huastecs, migrated, as, a, result, of, the, classic, maya, collapse, around, the, year, 900, ce, the, zapotecs, were, a, civilization, that, thrived, in, the, oaxaca, valley, from, the, late, 6th, century, bce, until, their, downfall, at, the, hands, of, the, spanish, conquistadors, the, city, of, monte, alb, n, was, an, important, religious, center, for, the, zapotecs, and, served, as, the, capital, of, the, empire, from, 700, bce, to, 700, ce, the, zapotecs, resisted, the, expansion, of, the, aztecs, until, they, were, subjugated, in, 1502, under, aztec, emperor, ahuitzotl, after, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, the, zapotecs, resisted, spanish, rule, until, king, cosijopii, i, surrendered, in, 1563, like, the, zapotecs, the, mixtecs, thrived, in, the, oaxaca, valley, the, mixtecs, consisted, of, separate, independent, kingdoms, and, city, states, rather, than, a, single, unified, empire, the, mixtecs, would, eventually, be, conquered, by, the, aztecs, until, the, spanish, conquest, the, mixtecs, saw, the, spanish, conquest, as, an, opportunity, for, liberation, and, established, agreements, with, the, conquistadors, that, allowed, them, to, preserve, their, cultural, traditions, though, relatively, few, sections, resisted, spanish, rule, the, totonac, civilization, was, concentrated, in, the, present, day, states, of, veracruz, and, puebla, the, totonacs, were, responsible, for, the, establishment, of, cities, such, as, el, taj, n, as, important, commercial, trading, centers, the, totonacs, would, later, assist, in, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, as, an, opportunity, to, liberate, themselves, from, aztec, military, imperialism, the, toltec, civilization, was, established, in, the, 8th, century, ce, the, toltec, empire, expanded, its, political, borders, to, as, far, south, as, the, yucat, n, peninsula, including, the, maya, city, of, chichen, itza, the, toltecs, established, vast, trading, relations, with, other, mesoamerican, civilizations, in, central, america, and, the, puebloans, in, present, day, new, mexico, during, the, post, classic, era, the, toltecs, suffered, a, subsequent, collapse, in, the, early, 12th, century, due, to, famine, and, civil, war, the, toltec, civilization, was, so, influential, to, the, point, where, many, groups, such, as, the, aztecs, claimed, to, be, descended, from, with, the, decline, of, the, toltec, civilization, came, political, fragmentation, in, the, valley, of, mexico, into, this, new, political, game, of, contenders, to, the, toltec, throne, stepped, outsiders, the, mexica, they, were, also, a, desert, people, one, of, seven, groups, who, formerly, called, themselves, azteca, in, memory, of, aztl, n, but, they, changed, their, name, after, years, of, migrating, since, they, were, not, from, the, valley, of, mexico, they, were, initially, seen, as, crude, and, unrefined, in, the, ways, of, the, nahua, civilization, through, political, maneuvers, and, ferocious, martial, skills, they, managed, to, rule, mexico, as, the, head, of, the, triple, alliance, which, included, two, other, aztec, cities, tetxcoco, and, tlacopan, latecomers, to, mexico, s, central, plateau, the, mexica, thought, of, themselves, nevertheless, as, heirs, of, the, civilizations, that, had, preceded, them, for, them, arts, sculpture, architecture, engraving, feather, mosaic, work, and, the, calendar, were, bequest, from, the, former, inhabitants, of, tula, the, toltecs, the, mexica, aztecs, were, the, rulers, of, much, of, central, mexico, by, about, 1400, while, yaquis, coras, and, apaches, commanded, sizable, regions, of, northern, desert, having, subjugated, most, of, the, other, regional, states, by, the, 1470s, at, their, peak, the, valley, of, mexico, where, the, aztec, empire, presided, saw, a, population, growth, that, included, nearly, one, million, people, during, the, late, aztec, period, 1350, 1519, their, capital, tenochtitlan, is, the, site, of, modern, day, mexico, city, at, its, peak, it, was, one, of, the, largest, cities, in, the, world, with, population, estimates, of, 200, 000, 300, 000, the, market, established, there, was, the, largest, ever, seen, by, the, conquistadores, on, arrival, initially, the, lands, that, would, someday, comprise, the, lands, of, the, powerful, tarascan, empire, were, inhabited, by, several, independent, communities, around, 1300, however, the, first, cazonci, tariacuri, united, these, communities, and, built, them, into, one, of, the, most, advanced, civilizations, in, mesoamerica, their, capital, at, tzintzuntzan, was, just, one, of, the, many, cities, there, were, ninety, more, under, its, control, the, tarascan, empire, was, among, the, largest, in, central, america, so, it, is, no, surprise, that, they, routinely, came, into, conflict, with, the, neighboring, aztec, empire, out, of, all, the, civilizations, in, its, area, the, tarascan, empire, was, the, most, prominent, in, metallurgy, harnessing, copper, silver, and, gold, to, create, items, such, as, tools, decorations, and, even, weapons, and, armor, bronze, was, also, used, the, great, victories, over, the, aztecs, by, the, tarascans, cannot, be, understated, nearly, every, war, they, fought, in, resulted, in, a, tarascan, victory, because, the, tarascan, empire, had, little, links, to, the, former, toltec, empire, they, were, also, quite, independent, in, culture, from, their, neighbors, the, aztecs, tlaxcaltec, olmec, mixtec, maya, and, others, were, very, similar, to, each, other, however, this, is, because, they, were, all, directly, preceded, by, the, toltecs, and, they, therefore, shared, almost, identical, cultures, the, tarascans, however, possessed, a, unique, religion, as, well, as, other, things, tlaxcala, was, a, nahua, republic, and, confederation, in, central, mexico, the, tlaxcalans, fiercely, resisted, aztec, expansion, during, the, flower, wars, ever, since, the, aztecs, expelled, them, from, lake, texcoco, the, tlaxcalans, would, later, ally, with, the, spanish, conquistadors, under, hern, n, cort, s, as, an, opportunity, to, liberate, them, from, the, aztecs, and, managed, to, successfully, conquer, the, aztecs, with, the, help, of, the, conquistadors, the, spaniards, would, reward, the, tlaxcalans, for, preserving, their, culture, and, for, their, assistance, in, defeating, the, aztecs, the, tlaxcalans, would, once, again, assist, to, the, spaniards, during, the, mixt, n, war, and, the, conquest, of, guatemala, cuzcatlan, was, a, pipil, confederacy, of, kingdoms, and, city, states, located, in, present, day, el, salvador, according, to, legend, cuzcatlan, was, established, by, toltec, migrants, during, the, classic, maya, collapse, in, approximately, 1200, ce, during, the, spanish, conquest, of, el, salvador, cuzcatlan, was, forced, to, surrender, to, conquistador, pedro, de, alvarado, in, 1528, the, lenca, people, were, composed, of, several, distinct, multilingual, confederations, and, city, states, in, present, day, el, salvador, and, honduras, cities, such, as, yarumela, were, important, commercial, centers, for, the, lenca, during, the, spanish, conquest, several, lenca, leaders, such, as, lempira, resisted, conversion, to, christianity, while, others, converted, peacefully, an, offshoot, of, the, pipil, people, from, el, salvador, the, nicarao, people, were, a, tribal, confederation, that, flourished, in, present, day, nicaragua, the, migration, of, the, nicarao, is, theorized, to, have, led, to, the, fall, of, the, city, of, teotihuacan, and, the, toltec, city, of, tula, the, nicarao, civilization, was, disestablished, during, the, spanish, conquest, of, nicaragua, in, 1522, the, nicoya, kingdom, was, an, elective, monarchy, that, thrived, in, the, nicoya, peninsula, in, costa, rica, it, existed, from, 800, ce, until, the, spanish, arrival, in, the, 16th, century, by, the, first, millennium, south,

elusive, a, diffusion, by, human, agents, has, been, put, forward, to, explain, the, pre, columbian, presence, in, oceania, of, several, cultivated, plant, species, native, to, south, america, such, as, the, bottle, gourd, lagenaria, siceraria, or, sweet, potato, ipomoea, batatas, direct, archaeological, evidence, for, such, pre, columbian, contacts, and, transport, has, not, emerged,

pnas, put, forward, dna, and, archaeological, evidence, that, domesticated, chickens, had, been, introduced, into, south, america, via, polynesia, by, late, pre, columbian, times, these, findings, were, challenged, by, a, later, study, published, in, the, same, journal, that, cast, doubt, on, the, dating, calibration, used, and, presented, alternative, mtdna, analyses, that, disagreed, with, a,

cultural, or, linguistic, legacy, of, such, contact, has, turned, up, on, the, north, central, coast, of, present, day, peru, norte, chico, or, caral, as, known, in, peru, was, a, civilization, that, emerged, around, 3000, bce, contemporary, with, urbanism, s, rise, in, mesopotamia, it, had, a, cluster, of, large, scale, urban, settlements, of, which, the, sacred, city, of, caral, in, the, supe, valley, is, one, of, the, largest, and, best, studied, sites, the, civilization, did, not, know, machinery, or, pottery, but, still, managed, to, develop, trade, especially, cotton, and, dehydrated, fish, it, was, a, hierarchical, society, that, managed, its, ecosystems, and, had, intercultural, exchange, its, economy, was, heavily, dependent, on, agriculture, and, fishing, on, the, nearby, coast, it, is, considered, one, of, the, cradles, of, civilization, in, the, world, and, caral, is, the, oldest, known, civilization, in, the, americas, the, valdivia, culture, was, concentrated, on, the, coast, of, ecuador, their, existence, was, recently, discovered, by, archeological, findings, their, culture, is, among, the, oldest, found, in, the, americas, spanning, from, 3500, to, 1800, bce, the, valdivia, lived, in, a, community, of, houses, built, in, a, circle, or, oval, around, a, central, plaza, they, were, sedentary, people, who, lived, off, farming, and, fishing, though, occasionally, they, hunted, for, deer, from, the, remains, that, have, been, found, scholars, have, determined, that, valdivians, cultivated, maize, kidney, beans, squash, cassava, chili, peppers, and, cotton, plants, the, last, of, which, was, used, to, make, clothing, valdivian, pottery, initially, was, rough, and, practical, but, it, became, showy, delicate, and, big, over, time, they, generally, used, red, and, gray, colors, and, the, polished, dark, red, pottery, is, characteristic, of, the, valdivia, period, in, its, ceramics, and, stone, works, the, valdivia, culture, shows, a,

yellow, muaco, and, el, jobo, in, falc, n, are, some, of, the, sites, that, have, yielded, archeological, material, from, these, times, these, groups, co, existed, with, megafauna, like, megatherium, glyptodonts, and, toxodonts, it, is, not, known, how, many, people, lived, in, venezuela, before, the, spanish, conquest, it, may, have, been, around, a, million, people, in, addition, to, today, s, peoples, included, groups, such, as, the, arawaks, caribs, and, timoto, cuicas, the, number, was, much, reduced, after, the, conquest, mainly, through, the, spread, of, new, diseases, from, europe, there, were, two, main, north, south, axes, of, the, pre, columbian, population, producing, maize, in, the, west, and, manioc, in, the, east, large, parts, of, the, llanos, plains, were, cultivated, through, a, combination, of, slash, and, burn, and, permanent, settled, agriculture, basically, maize, and, tobacco, the, indigenous, peoples, of, venezuela, had, already, encountered, crude, oils, and, asphalts, that, seeped, up, through, the, ground, to, the, surface, known, to, the, locals, as, mene, the, thick, black, liquid, was, primarily, used, for, medicinal, purposes, as, an, illumination, source, and, for, the, caulking, of, canoes, in, the, 16th, century, when, spanish, colonization, began, in, venezuelan, territory, the, population, of, several, indigenous, peoples, such, as, the, mariches, descendants, of, the, caribes, declined, the, diaguita, consisted, of, several, distinct, chiefdoms, across, the, argentine, northwest, the, diaguita, culture, emerged, around, 1000, ce, after, the, replacement, of, the, las, nimas, complex, the, diaguita, resisted, spanish, colonialism, during, the, calchaqu, wars, until, they, were, forced, to, surrender, and, submit, to, spanish, rule, in, 1667, the, ta, no, people, were, fragmented, into, numerous, chiefdoms, across, the, greater, antilles, the, lucayan, archipelago, and, the, northern, lesser, antilles, the, ta, no, were, the, first, pre, columbian, people, to, encounter, christopher, columbus, during, his, voyage, in, 1492, the, ta, no, would, later, be, subject, to, slavery, by, the, spanish, colonists, under, the, encomienda, system, until, they, were, deemed, virtually, extinct, in, 1565, the, huetar, people, were, a, major, ethnic, group, that, lived, in, costa, rica, the, huetar, were, composed, of, several, independent, kingdoms, such, as, the, western, kingdom, ruled, by, garabito, and, the, eastern, kingdom, ruled, by, el, guarco, and, correque, after, their, annexation, into,

river, in, northern, brazil, between, 800, and, 1400, ce, the, marajoara, consisted, of, a, complex, society, that, built, mounds, and, constructed, sophisticated, settlements, the, indigenous, people, of, the, area, adopted, methods, of, large, scale, agriculture, through, the, use, of, terra, preta, which, would, support, complex, chiefdoms, studies, suggest, that, the, civilization, housed, around, 100, 000, inhabitants, located, in, the, xingu, indigenous, park, in, brazil, kuhikugu, consisted, of, an, urban, complex, that, housed, around, 50, 000, inhabitants, and, 20, settlements, the, civilization, was, likely, established, by, the, ancestors, of, the, kuikuro, people, the, people, also, constructed, roads, bridges, and, trenches, for, defensive, purposes, and, were, purported, to, be, farmers, as, evidenced, by, the, fields, of, cassava, and, the, use, of, terra, preta, like, most, other, amazonian, civilizations, the, disappearance, of, kuhikugu, was, largely, attributed, to, old, world, diseases, introduced, by, european, colonists, also, known, as, the, omagua, umana, and, kambeba, the, cambeba, are, an, indigenous, people, in, brazil, s, amazon, basin, the, cambeba, were, a, populous, organized, society, in, the, late, pre, columbian, era, whose, population, suffered, a, steep, decline, in, the, early, years, of, the, columbian, exchange, the, spanish, explorer, francisco, de, orellana, traversed, the, amazon, river, during, the, 16th, century, and, reported, densely, populated, regions, running, hundreds, of, kilometers, along, the, river, these, populations, left, no, lasting, monuments, possibly, because, they, used, local, wood, as, their, construction, material, as, stone, was, not, locally, available, while, it, is, possible, orellana, may, have, exaggerated, the, level, of, development, among, the, amazonians, their, semi, nomadic, descendants, have, the, odd, distinction, among, tribal, indigenous, societies, of, a, hereditary, yet, landless, aristocracy, archaeological, evidence, has, revealed, the, continued, presence, of, semi, domesticated, orchards, as, well, as, vast, areas, of, land, enriched, with, terra, preta, both, of, these, discoveries, along, with, cambeba, ceramics, discovered, within, the, same, archaeological, levels, suggest, that, a, large, and, organized, civilization, existed, in, the, area, in, the, upano, river, valley, of, eastern, ecuador, several, cities, were, established, by, the, upano, and, kilamope, cultures, around, 500, bce, the, cities, in, the, upano, valley, consisted, of, agricultural, societies, that, cultivated, crops, such, as, corn, manioc, and, sweet, potato, the, cities, fell, into, decline, around, 600, ce, early, inhabitants, of, the, americas,

the, americas, early, indigenous, peoples, began, using, fire, in, a, widespread, manner, intentional, burning, of, vegetation, was, taken, up, to, mimic, the, effects, of, natural, fires, that, tended, to, clear, forest, understories, thereby, making, travel, easier, and, facilitating, the, growth, of, herbs, and, berry, producing, plants, that, were, important, for, both, food, and, medicines, this, created, the, pre, columbian, savannas, of, north, america, while, not, as, widespread, as, in, afro, eurasia, indigenous, americans, did, have, livestock, domesticated, turkeys, were, common, in, mesoamerica, and, some, regions, of, north, america, they, were, valued, for, their, meat, feathers, and, possibly, eggs, there, is, documentation, of, mesoamericans, utilizing,
