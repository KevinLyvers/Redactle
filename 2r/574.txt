the, dreyfus, affair, french, affaire, dreyfus, pronounced, was, a, political, scandal, that, divided, the, third, french, republic, from, 1894, until, its, resolution, in, 1906, the, scandal, began, in, december, 1894, when, captain, alfred, dreyfus, a, 35, year, old, alsatian, french, artillery, officer, of, jewish, descent, was, convicted, of, treason, for, communicating, french, military, secrets, to, the, german, embassy, in, paris, he, was, sentenced, to, life, imprisonment, and, sent, overseas, to, the, penal, colony, on, devil, s, island, in, french, guiana, where, he, spent, the, following, five, years, imprisoned, in, very, harsh, conditions, in, 1896, evidence, came, to, light, primarily, through, the, investigations, of, lieutenant, colonel, georges, picquart, head, of, counter, espionage, which, identified, the, real, culprit, as, a, french, army, major, named, ferdinand, walsin, esterhazy, high, ranking, military, officials, suppressed, the, new, evidence, and, a, military, court, unanimously, acquitted, esterhazy, after, a, trial, lasting, only, two, days, the, army, laid, additional, charges, against, dreyfus, based, on, forged, documents, subsequently, writer, mile, zola, s, open, letter, j, accuse, in, the, newspaper, l, aurore, stoked, a, growing, movement, of, political, support, for, dreyfus, putting, pressure, on, the, government, to, reopen, the, case, in, 1899, dreyfus, was, returned, to, france, for, another, trial, the, intense, political, and, judicial, scandal, that, ensued, divided, french, society, between, those, who, supported, dreyfus, the, dreyfusards, such, as, sarah, bernhardt, anatole, france, charles, p, guy, henri, poincar, and, georges, clemenceau, and, those, who, condemned, him, the, anti, dreyfusards, such, as, douard, drumont, the, director, and, publisher, of, the, antisemitic, newspaper, la, libre, parole, the, new, trial, resulted, in, another, conviction, and, a, 10, year, sentence, but, dreyfus, was, pardoned, and, released, in, 1906, dreyfus, was, exonerated, after, being, reinstated, as, a, major, in, the, french, army, he, served, during, the, whole, of, world, war, i, ending, his, service, with, the, rank, of, lieutenant, colonel, he, died, in, 1935, the, dreyfus, affair, came, to, symbolise, modern, injustice, in, the, francophone, world, it, remains, one, of, the, most, notable, examples, of, a, complex, miscarriage, of, justice, and, antisemitism, the, affair, divided, france, into, pro, republican, anticlerical, dreyfusards, and, pro, army, mostly, catholic, anti, dreyfusards, embittering, french, politics, and, encouraging, radicalisation, the, press, played, a, crucial, role, in, exposing, information, and, in, shaping, and, expressing, public, opinion, on, both, sides, of, the, conflict, at, the, end, of, 1894, french, army, captain, alfred, dreyfus, a, graduate, of, the, cole, polytechnique, and, a, jew, of, alsatian, origin, was, accused, of, handing, secret, documents, to, the, imperial, german, military, after, a, closed, trial, he, was, found, guilty, of, treason, and, sentenced, to, life, imprisonment, he, was, deported, to, devil, s, island, in, french, guiana, at, that, time, the, opinion, of, the, french, political, class, was, unanimously, unfavourable, towards, dreyfus, the, dreyfus, family, particularly, his, older, brother, mathieu, remained, convinced, of, his, innocence, and, worked, with, journalist, bernard, lazare, to, prove, it, in, march, 1896, colonel, georges, picquart, head, of, counter, espionage, found, evidence, that, the, real, traitor, was, major, ferdinand, walsin, esterhazy, the, general, staff, refused, to, reconsider, its, judgment, and, instead, transferred, picquart, to, a, position, in, north, africa, in, july, 1897, dreyfus, s, family, contacted, the, president, of, the, senate, auguste, scheurer, kestner, to, draw, attention, to, the, weakness, of, the, evidence, against, dreyfus, scheurer, kestner, reported, three, months, later, that, he, was, convinced, dreyfus, was, innocent, and, persuaded, georges, clemenceau, a, newspaper, reporter, and, former, member, of, the, chamber, of, deputies, of, the, same, in, the, same, month, mathieu, complained, about, esterhazy, to, the, ministry, of, war, in, january, 1898, two, events, raised, the, case, to, national, prominence, esterhazy, was, acquitted, of, treason, charges, subsequently, shaving, his, moustache, and, fleeing, france, and, mile, zola, published, his, j, accuse, a, dreyfusard, declaration, that, rallied, many, intellectuals, to, dreyfus, s, cause, france, became, increasingly, divided, over, the, case, and, the, issue, continued, to, be, hotly, debated, until, the, end, of, the, century, antisemitic, riots, erupted, in, more, than, twenty, french, cities, and, riots, in, algiers, resulted, in, several, deaths, despite, covert, attempts, by, the, army, to, quash, the, case, the, initial, conviction, was, annulled, by, the, supreme, court, after, a, thorough, investigation, a, new, court, martial, was, held, at, rennes, in, 1899, dreyfus, was, convicted, again, and, sentenced, to, ten, years, of, hard, labour, though, the, sentence, was, commuted, due, to, extenuating, circumstances, dreyfus, accepted, the, presidential, pardon, granted, by, president, mile, loubet, in, 1906, his, innocence, was, officially, established, by, an, irrevocable, judgement, of, the, supreme, court, dreyfus, was, reinstated, in, the, army, with, the, rank, of, major, and, participated, in, the, first, world, war, he, died, in, 1935, the, implications, of, this, case, were, numerous, and, affected, all, aspects, of, french, public, life, it, was, regarded, as, a, vindication, of, the, third, republic, and, became, a, founding, myth, but, it, led, to, a, renewal, of, nationalism, in, the, military, it, slowed, the, reform, of, french, catholicism, and, republican, integration, of, catholics, the, affair, engendered, numerous, antisemitic, demonstrations, which, in, turn, affected, sentiment, within, the, jewish, communities, of, central, and, western, europe, at, the, same, time, jews, in, the, russian, empire, were, under, pressure, of, pogroms, in, response, to, political, instability, within, the, pale, these, factors, persuaded, theodor, herzl, one, of, the, founding, fathers, of, zionism, that, the, jews, must, leave, europe, and, establish, their, own, state, in, 1894, the, third, republic, was, twenty, four, years, old, although, the, 16, may, crisis, in, 1877, had, crippled, the, political, influence, of, both, the, bourbon, and, orl, anist, royalists, its, ministries, continued, to, be, short, lived, as, the, country, lurched, from, crisis, to, crisis, three, years, immediately, preceding, the, dreyfus, affair, were, the, near, coup, of, georges, boulanger, in, 1889, the, panama, scandals, in, 1892, and, the, anarchist, threat, reduced, by, the, villainous, laws, of, july, 1894, the, elections, of, 1893, were, focused, on, the, social, question, and, resulted, in, a, republican, victory, just, under, half, the, seats, against, the, conservative, right, and, the, reinforcement, of, the, radicals, about, 150, seats, and, socialists, about, 50, seats, the, opposition, of, the, radicals, and, socialists, resulted, in, a, centrist, government, with, policies, oriented, towards, economic, protectionism, a, certain, indifference, to, social, issues, a, willingness, to, break, international, isolation, the, russian, alliance, and, development, of, the, colonial, empire, these, centrist, policies, resulted, in, cabinet, instability, with, some, republican, members, of, the, government, sometimes, aligning, with, the, radicals, and, some, orl, anists, aligning, with, the, legitimists, in, five, successive, governments, from, 1893, to, 1896, this, instability, coincided, with, an, equally, unstable, presidency, president, sadi, carnot, was, assassinated, on, 24, june, 1894, his, moderate, successor, jean, casimir, perier, resigned, several, months, later, on, 15, january, 1895, and, was, replaced, by, f, lix, faure, following, the, failure, of, the, radical, government, of, l, on, bourgeois, in, 1896, the, president, appointed, jules, m, line, as, prime, minister, his, government, faced, the, opposition, of, the, left, and, of, some, republicans, including, the, progressive, union, and, made, sure, to, keep, the, support, of, the, right, he, sought, to, appease, religious, social, and, economic, tensions, and, conducted, a, fairly, conservative, policy, he, succeeded, in, improving, stability, and, it, was, under, this, stable, government, that, the, dreyfus, affair, occurred, the, dreyfus, affair, occurred, in, the, context, of, german, annexation, of, alsace, and, moselle, an, event, that, fed, the, most, extreme, nationalism, the, traumatic, defeat, of, france, in, 1870, seemed, far, away, but, a, vengeful, spirit, remained, the, military, required, considerable, resources, to, prepare, for, the, next, conflict, and, it, was, in, this, spirit, that, the, franco, russian, alliance, of, 27, august, 1892, was, signed, although, some, opponents, thought, it, against, nature, the, army, had, recovered, from, the, defeat, but, many, of, its, officers, were, aristocrats, and, monarchists, cult, of, the, flag, and, contempt, for, the, parliamentary, republic, prevailed, in, the, army, the, republic, celebrated, its, army, the, army, ignored, the, republic, over, the, previous, ten, years, the, army, had, undergone, a, significant, shift, resulting, from, its, twofold, aim, to, democratize, and, modernize, the, graduates, of, the, cole, polytechnique, now, competed, effectively, with, officers, from, the, main, career, path, of, saint, cyr, which, caused, strife, bitterness, and, jealousy, among, junior, officers, expecting, promotions, the, period, was, also, marked, by, an, arms, race, that, primarily, affected, artillery, there, were, improvements, in, heavy, artillery, guns, of, 120, mm, and, 155, mm, models, 1890, baquet, new, hydropneumatic, brakes, but, also, and, especially, development, of, the, ultra, secret, 75mm, gun, the, operation, of, military, counterintelligence, alias, the, statistics, section, sr, should, be, noted, spying, as, a, tool, for, secret, war, was, a, novelty, as, an, organised, activity, by, governments, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, statistics, section, was, created, in, 1871, but, consisted, of, only, a, handful, of, officers, and, civilians, its, head, in, 1894, was, lieutenant, colonel, jean, sandherr, a, graduate, of, saint, cyr, an, alsatian, from, mulhouse, and, a, convinced, antisemite, its, military, mission, was, clear, to, retrieve, information, about, potential, enemies, of, france, and, to, feed, them, false, information, the, statistics, section, was, supported, by, the, secret, affairs, of, the, quai, d, orsay, at, the, ministry, of, foreign, affairs, which, was, headed, by, a, young, diplomat, maurice, pal, ologue, the, arms, race, created, an, acute, atmosphere, of, intrigue, from, 1890, in, french, counter, espionage, one, of, the, missions, of, the, section, was, to, spy, on, the, german, embassy, at, rue, de, lille, in, paris, to, thwart, any, attempt, by, the, french, to, transmit, important, information, to, the, germans, this, was, especially, critical, since, several, cases, of, espionage, had, already, been, featured, in, the, headlines, of, newspapers, which, were, fond, of, sensationalism, in, 1890, the, archivist, boutonnet, was, convicted, for, selling, plans, of, shells, that, used, melinite, the, german, military, attach, in, paris, in, 1894, was, count, maximilian, von, schwartzkoppen, who, developed, a, policy, of, infiltration, that, appears, to, have, been, effective, in, the, 1880s, schwartzkoppen, had, begun, an, affair, with, an, italian, military, attach, lieutenant, colonel, count, alessandro, panizzardi, while, neither, had, anything, to, do, with, dreyfus, their, intimate, and, erotic, correspondence, e, g, don, t, exhaust, yourself, with, too, much, buggery, which, was, obtained, by, the, authorities, lent, an, air, of, truth, to, other, documents, that, were, forged, by, prosecutors, to, lend, retroactive, credibility, to, dreyfus, s, conviction, as, a, spy, some, of, these, forgeries, referred, to, the, real, affair, between, the, two, officers, in, one, alessandro, supposedly, informed, his, lover, that, if, dreyfus, is, brought, in, for, questioning, they, must, both, claim, that, they, never, had, any, dealings, with, that, jew, clearly, no, one, can, ever, know, what, happened, with, him, the, letters, real, and, fake, provided, a, convenient, excuse, for, placing, the, entire, dreyfus, dossier, under, seal, given, that, exposure, of, the, liaison, would, have, dishonoured, germany, and, italy, s, military, and, compromised, diplomatic, relations, as, homosexuality, was, like, judaism, then, often, perceived, as, a, sign, of, national, degeneration, recent, historians, have, suggested, that, combining, them, to, inflate, the, scandal, may, have, shaped, the, prosecution, strategy, since, early, 1894, the, statistics, section, had, investigated, traffic, in, master, plans, for, nice, and, the, meuse, conducted, by, an, officer, whom, the, germans, and, italians, nicknamed, dubois, this, is, what, led, to, the, origins, of, the, dreyfus, affair, the, social, context, was, marked, by, the, rise, of, nationalism, and, antisemitism, the, growth, of, antisemitism, virulent, since, the, publication, of, jewish, france, by, douard, drumont, in, 1886, 150, 000, copies, in, the, first, year, went, hand, in, hand, with, the, rise, of, clericalism, tensions, were, high, in, all, strata, of, society, fueled, by, an, influential, press, which, was, virtually, free, to, write, and, disseminate, any, information, even, if, offensive, or, defamatory, legal, risks, were, limited, if, the, target, was, a, private, person, antisemitism, did, not, spare, the, military, which, practised, hidden, discrimination, with, the, cote, d, amour, a, subjective, assessment, of, personal, acceptability, system, of, irrational, grading, encountered, by, dreyfus, in, his, application, to, the, bourges, school, however, while, prejudices, of, this, nature, undoubtedly, existed, within, the, confines, of, the, general, staff, the, french, army, as, a, whole, was, relatively, open, to, individual, talent, at, the, time, of, the, dreyfus, affair, there, were, an, estimated, 300, jewish, officers, in, the, army, about, 3, per, cent, of, the, total, of, whom, ten, were, generals, the, popularity, of, the, duel, using, sword, or, small, pistol, sometimes, causing, death, bore, witness, to, the, tensions, of, the, period, when, a, series, of, press, articles, in, la, libre, parole, accused, jewish, officers, of, betraying, their, birth, the, officers, challenged, the, editors, captain, cr, mieu, foa, a, jewish, alsatian, graduated, from, the, ecole, polytechnique, fought, unsuccessfully, against, drumont, and, against, m, de, lamase, who, was, the, author, of, the, articles, captain, mayer, another, jewish, officer, was, killed, by, the, marquis, de, mor, s, a, friend, of, drumont, in, another, duel, hatred, of, jews, was, now, public, and, violent, driven, by, a, firebrand, drumont, who, demonized, the, jewish, presence, in, france, jews, in, metropolitan, france, in, 1895, numbered, about, 80, 000, 40, 000, in, paris, alone, who, were, highly, integrated, into, society, an, additional, 45, 000, jews, lived, in, algeria, the, launch, of, la, libre, parole, with, a, circulation, estimated, at, 200, 000, copies, in, 1892, allowed, drumont, to, expand, his, audience, to, a, popular, readership, already, enticed, by, the, boulangiste, adventure, in, the, past, the, antisemitism, circulated, by, la, libre, parole, as, well, as, by, l, clair, le, petit, journal, la, patrie, l, intransigeant, and, la, croix, drew, on, antisemitic, roots, in, certain, catholic, circles, publications, remarking, on, the, dreyfus, affair, often, reinforced, antisemitic, sentiments, language, and, imagery, the, mus, e, des, horreurs, was, a, collection, of, anti, dreyfus, posters, illustrated, by, victor, lenepveu, during, the, dreyfus, affair, lenepveu, caricatured, prominent, jews, dreyfus, supporters, and, republican, statesman, no, 35, amnistie, populaire, depicts, the, corpse, of, dreyfus, himself, as, it, dangles, from, a, noose, large, noses, money, and, lenepveu, s, general, tendency, to, illustrate, subjects, with, bodies, of, animals, likely, contributed, to, the, dissemination, of, antisemitism, in, french, popular, culture, the, staff, of, the, military, intelligence, service, sr, worked, around, the, clock, to, spy, on, the, german, embassy, in, paris, they, had, managed, to, get, a, french, housekeeper, named, madame, bastian, hired, to, work, in, the, building, and, spy, on, the, germans, in, september, 1894, she, found, a, torn, up, note, which, she, handed, over, to, her, employers, at, the, military, intelligence, service, this, note, later, became, known, as, the, bordereau, this, piece, of, paper, torn, into, six, large, pieces, unsigned, and, undated, was, addressed, to, the, german, military, attach, stationed, at, the, german, embassy, maximilian, von, schwartzkoppen, it, stated, that, confidential, french, military, documents, regarding, the, newly, developed, hydraulic, brake, of, 120, and, the, way, this, gun, has, worked, were, about, to, be, sent, to, a, foreign, power, this, catch, seemed, of, sufficient, importance, for, the, head, of, the, statistical, section, the, mulhousian, jean, sandherr, to, inform, the, minister, of, war, general, auguste, mercier, in, fact, the, sr, suspected, that, there, had, been, leaks, since, the, beginning, of, 1894, and, had, been, trying, to, find, the, perpetrator, the, minister, had, been, harshly, attacked, in, the, press, for, his, actions, which, were, deemed, incompetent, and, appears, to, have, sought, an, opportunity, to, enhance, his, image, he, immediately, initiated, two, secret, investigations, one, administrative, and, one, judicial, to, find, the, culprit, using, simple, though, crude, reasoning, the, circle, of, the, search, was, arbitrarily, restricted, to, suspects, posted, to, or, former, employees, of, the, general, staff, necessarily, a, trainee, artillery, officer, the, ideal, culprit, was, identified, captain, alfred, dreyfus, a, graduate, of, the, cole, polytechnique, and, an, artillery, officer, of, the, jewish, faith, and, of, alsatian, origin, coming, from, the, republican, meritocracy, at, the, beginning, of, the, case, the, emphasis, was, rather, on, the, alsatian, origins, of, dreyfus, than, on, his, religion, these, origins, were, not, however, exceptional, because, these, officers, were, favoured, by, france, for, their, knowledge, of, the, german, language, and, culture, there, was, also, antisemitism, in, the, offices, of, the, general, staff, and, it, fast, became, central, to, the, affair, by, filling, in, the, credibility, gaps, in, the, preliminary, enquiry, in, particular, dreyfus, was, at, that, time, the, only, jewish, officer, to, be, recently, passed, by, the, general, staff, in, fact, the, reputation, of, dreyfus, as, a, cold, and, withdrawn, or, even, haughty, character, as, well, as, his, curiosity, worked, strongly, against, him, these, traits, of, character, some, false, others, natural, made, the, charges, plausible, by, turning, the, most, ordinary, acts, of, everyday, life, in, the, ministry, into, proof, of, espionage, from, the, beginning, a, biased, and, one, sided, multiplication, of, errors, led, the, state, to, a, false, position, this, was, present, throughout, the, affair, where, irrationality, prevailed, over, the, positivism, in, vogue, in, that, period, from, this, first, hour, the, phenomenon, occurred, that, will, dominate, the, whole, affair, it, is, no, longer, controlled, by, facts, and, circumstances, carefully, examined, which, will, constitute, a, belief, it, is, the, irresistible, cavalier, conviction, which, distorts, the, facts, and, beliefs, to, condemn, dreyfus, the, writing, on, the, bordereau, had, to, be, compared, to, that, of, the, captain, there, was, nobody, competent, to, analyse, the, writing, on, the, general, staff, then, major, du, paty, de, clam, entered, the, scene, an, eccentric, man, who, prided, himself, on, being, an, expert, in, graphology, on, being, shown, some, letters, by, dreyfus, and, the, bordereau, on, 5, october, du, paty, concluded, immediately, who, had, written, the, two, writings, after, a, day, of, additional, work, he, provided, a, report, that, despite, some, differences, the, similarities, were, sufficient, to, warrant, an, investigation, dreyfus, was, therefore, the, probable, author, of, the, bordereau, in, the, eyes, of, the, general, staff, general, mercier, believed, he, had, the, guilty, party, but, he, exaggerated, the, value, of, the, affair, which, took, on, the, status, of, an, affair, of, state, during, the, week, preceding, the, arrest, of, dreyfus, the, minister, did, consult, and, inform, all, the, authorities, of, the, state, yet, despite, prudent, counsel, and, courageous, objections, expressed, by, gabriel, hanotaux, in, the, council, of, ministers, he, decided, to, pursue, it, du, paty, de, clam, was, appointed, judicial, police, officer, to, lead, an, official, investigation, meanwhile, several, parallel, sources, of, information, were, opening, up, some, on, the, personality, of, dreyfus, others, to, ensure, the, truth, of, the, identity, of, the, author, of, the, bordereau, the, expert, gobert, was, not, convinced, and, found, many, differences, he, even, wrote, that, the, nature, of, the, writing, on, the, bordereau, excludes, disguised, handwriting, disappointed, mercier, then, called, in, alphonse, bertillon, the, inventor, of, forensic, anthropometry, but, no, handwriting, expert, he, was, initially, no, more, positive, than, gobert, but, he, did, not, exclude, the, possibility, of, its, being, the, writing, of, dreyfus, later, under, pressure, from, the, military, he, argued, that, dreyfus, had, autocopied, it, and, developed, his, theory, of, autoforgery, on, 13, october, 1894, without, any, tangible, evidence, and, with, an, empty, file, general, mercier, summoned, captain, dreyfus, for, a, general, inspection, in, bourgeois, clothing, i, e, in, civilian, clothes, the, purpose, of, the, general, staff, was, to, obtain, the, perfect, proof, under, french, law, a, confession, that, confession, was, to, be, obtained, by, surprise, by, dictating, a, letter, based, on, the, bordereau, to, reveal, his, guilt, on, the, morning, of, 15, october, 1894, captain, dreyfus, underwent, this, ordeal, but, admitted, nothing, du, paty, even, tried, to, suggest, suicide, by, placing, a, revolver, in, front, of, dreyfus, but, he, refused, to, take, his, life, saying, he, wanted, to, live, to, establish, his, innocence, the, hopes, of, the, military, were, crushed, nevertheless, du, paty, de, clam, still, arrested, the, captain, accused, him, of, conspiring, with, the, enemy, and, told, him, that, he, would, be, brought, before, a, court, martial, dreyfus, was, imprisoned, at, the, cherche, midi, prison, in, paris, mrs, dreyfus, was, informed, of, the, arrest, the, same, day, by, a, police, raid, to, search, their, apartment, she, was, terrorized, by, du, paty, who, ordered, her, to, keep, the, arrest, of, her, husband, secret, and, even, said, one, word, one, single, word, and, it, will, be, a, european, war, illegally, dreyfus, was, placed, in, solitary, confinement, in, prison, where, du, paty, interrogated, him, day, and, night, in, order, to, obtain, a, confession, which, failed, the, captain, was, morally, supported, by, the, first, dreyfusard, major, forzinetti, commandant, of, the, military, prisons, of, paris, on, 29, october, 1894, the, affair, was, revealed, in, an, article, in, la, libre, parole, the, antisemitic, newspaper, owned, by, douard, drumont, this, marked, the, beginning, of, a, very, brutal, press, campaign, until, the, trial, this, event, put, the, affair, in, the, field, of, antisemitism, where, it, remained, until, its, conclusion, on, 1, november, 1894, alfred, s, brother, mathieu, dreyfus, became, aware, of, the, arrest, after, being, called, urgently, to, paris, he, became, the, architect, of, the, arduous, fight, for, the, liberation, of, his, brother, without, hesitation, he, began, looking, for, a, lawyer, and, retained, the, distinguished, criminal, lawyer, edgar, demange, on, 3, november, 1894, general, saussier, the, military, governor, of, paris, reluctantly, gave, the, order, for, an, enquiry, he, had, the, power, to, stop, the, process, but, did, not, perhaps, because, of, an, exaggerated, confidence, in, military, justice, major, besson, d, ormescheville, the, recorder, for, the, military, court, wrote, an, indictment, in, which, moral, elements, of, the, charge, which, gossiped, about, the, habits, of, dreyfus, and, his, alleged, attendance, at, gambling, circles, his, knowledge, of, german, and, his, remarkable, memory, were, developed, more, extensively, than, the, material, elements, which, are, rarely, seen, in, the, charge, this, is, a, proof, of, guilt, because, dreyfus, made, everything, disappear, the, complete, lack, of, neutrality, of, the, indictment, led, to, mile, zola, calling, it, a, monument, of, bias, after, the, news, broke, on, dreyfus, arrest, many, journalists, flocked, to, the, story, and, flooded, the, story, with, speculations, and, accusations, the, renowned, journalist, and, antisemitic, agitator, edouard, drumont, wrote, in, his, publication, on, november, 3, 1894, what, a, terrible, lesson, this, disgraceful, treason, of, the, jew, dreyfus, on, 4, december, 1894, dreyfus, was, referred, to, the, first, military, court, with, this, dossier, the, secrecy, was, lifted, and, demange, could, access, the, file, for, the, first, time, after, reading, it, the, lawyer, had, absolute, confidence, as, he, saw, the, emptiness, of, the, prosecution, s, case, the, prosecution, rested, completely, on, the, writing, on, a, single, piece, of, paper, the, bordereau, on, which, experts, disagreed, and, on, vague, indirect, testimonies, during, the, two, months, before, the, trial, the, press, went, wild, la, libre, parole, l, autorit, le, journal, and, le, temps, described, the, supposed, life, of, dreyfus, through, lies, and, bad, fiction, this, was, also, an, opportunity, for, extreme, headlines, from, la, libre, parole, and, la, croix, to, justify, their, previous, campaigns, against, the, presence, of, jews, in, the, army, on, the, theme, you, have, been, told, this, long, delay, above, all, enabled, the, general, staff, to, prepare, public, opinion, and, to, put, indirect, pressure, on, the, judges, on, 8, november, 1894, general, mercier, declared, dreyfus, guilty, in, an, interview, with, le, figaro, he, repeated, himself, on, 29, november, 1894, in, an, article, by, arthur, meyer, in, le, gaulois, which, in, fact, condemned, the, indictment, against, dreyfus, and, asked, how, much, freedom, will, the, military, court, have, to, judge, the, defendant, the, jousting, of, the, columnists, took, place, within, a, broader, debate, about, the, issue, of, a, closed, court, for, ranc, and, cassagnac, who, represented, the, majority, of, the, press, the, closed, court, was, a, low, manoeuvre, to, enable, the, acquittal, of, dreyfus, because, the, minister, is, a, coward, the, proof, was, that, he, grovels, before, the, prussians, by, agreeing, to, publish, the, denials, of, the, german, ambassador, in, paris, in, other, newspapers, such, as, l, clair, on, 13, december, 1894, the, closed, court, is, necessary, to, avoid, a, casus, belli, while, for, judet, in, le, petit, journal, of, 18, december, the, closed, court, is, our, impregnable, refuge, against, germany, or, in, la, croix, the, same, day, it, must, be, the, most, absolute, closed, court, the, trial, opened, on, 19, december, 1894, at, one, o, clock, and, a, closed, court, was, immediately, pronounced, this, closed, court, was, not, legally, consistent, since, major, picquart, and, prefect, louis, l, pine, were, present, at, certain, proceedings, in, violation, of, the, law, the, closed, court, allowed, the, military, to, avoid, disclosing, the, emptiness, of, their, evidence, to, the, public, and, to, stifle, debate, as, expected, the, emptiness, of, their, case, appeared, clearly, during, the, hearings, detailed, discussions, on, the, bordereau, showed, that, captain, dreyfus, could, not, be, the, author, at, the, same, time, the, accused, himself, protested, his, innocence, and, defended, himself, point, by, point, with, energy, and, logic, moreover, his, statements, were, supported, by, a, dozen, defence, witnesses, finally, the, absence, of, motive, for, the, crime, was, a, serious, thorn, in, the, prosecution, case, dreyfus, was, indeed, a, very, patriotic, officer, highly, rated, by, his, superiors, very, rich, and, with, no, tangible, reason, to, betray, france, the, fact, of, dreyfus, s, jewishness, which, was, used, extensively, by, the, right, wing, press, was, not, openly, presented, in, court, alphonse, bertillon, an, eccentric, criminologist, who, was, not, an, expert, in, handwriting, was, presented, as, a, scholar, of, the, first, importance, he, advanced, the, theory, of, autoforgery, during, the, trial, and, accused, dreyfus, of, imitating, his, own, handwriting, explaining, the, differences, in, writing, by, using, extracts, of, writing, from, his, brother, matthieu, and, his, wife, lucie, this, theory, although, later, regarded, as, bizarre, and, astonishing, seems, to, have, had, some, effect, on, the, judges, in, addition, major, hubert, joseph, henry, deputy, head, of, the, sr, and, discoverer, of, the, bordereau, made, a, theatrical, statement, in, open, court, he, argued, that, leaks, betraying, the, general, staff, had, been, suspected, to, exist, since, february, 1894, and, that, a, respectable, person, accused, captain, dreyfus, he, swore, on, oath, that, the, traitor, was, dreyfus, pointing, to, the, crucifix, hanging, on, the, wall, of, the, court, dreyfus, was, apoplectic, with, rage, and, demanded, to, be, confronted, with, his, anonymous, accuser, which, was, rejected, by, the, general, staff, the, incident, had, an, undeniable, effect, on, the, court, which, was, composed, of, seven, officers, who, were, both, judges, and, jury, however, the, outcome, of, the, trial, remained, uncertain, the, conviction, of, the, judges, had, been, shaken, by, the, firm, and, logical, answers, of, the, accused, the, judges, took, leave, to, deliberate, but, the, general, staff, still, had, a, card, in, hand, to, tip, the, balance, decisively, against, dreyfus, military, witnesses, at, the, trial, alerted, high, command, about, the, risk, of, acquittal, for, this, eventuality, the, statistics, section, had, prepared, a, file, containing, in, principle, four, absolute, proofs, of, the, guilt, of, captain, dreyfus, accompanied, by, an, explanatory, note, the, contents, of, this, secret, file, remained, uncertain, until, 2013, when, they, were, released, by, the, french, ministry, of, defence, recent, research, indicates, the, existence, of, numbering, which, suggests, the, presence, of, a, dozen, documents, among, these, letters, were, some, of, an, erotic, homosexual, nature, the, davignon, letter, among, others, raising, the, question, of, the, tainted, methods, of, the, statistics, section, and, the, objective, of, their, choice, of, documents, the, secret, file, was, illegally, submitted, at, the, beginning, of, the, deliberations, by, the, president, of, the, military, court, colonel, milien, maurel, by, order, of, the, minister, of, war, general, mercier, later, at, the, rennes, trial, of, 1899, general, mercier, explained, falsely, the, nature, of, the, prohibited, disclosure, of, the, documents, submitted, in, the, courtroom, this, file, contained, in, addition, to, letters, without, much, interest, some, of, which, were, falsified, a, piece, known, as, the, scoundrel, d, it, was, a, letter, from, the, german, military, attach, maximilian, von, schwartzkoppen, to, the, italian, military, attach, lieutenant, colonel, alessandro, panizzardi, intercepted, by, the, sr, the, letter, was, supposed, to, accuse, dreyfus, definitively, since, according, to, his, accusers, it, was, signed, with, the, initial, of, his, name, in, reality, the, statistics, section, knew, that, the, letter, could, not, be, attributed, to, dreyfus, and, if, it, was, it, was, with, criminal, intent, colonel, maurel, confirmed, in, the, second, dreyfus, trial, that, the, secret, documents, were, not, used, to, win, the, support, of, the, judges, of, the, military, court, he, contradicted, himself, however, by, saying, that, he, read, only, one, document, which, was, enough, on, 22, december, 1894, after, several, hours, of, deliberation, the, verdict, was, reached, seven, judges, unanimously, convicted, alfred, dreyfus, of, collusion, with, a, foreign, power, to, the, maximum, penalty, under, section, 76, of, the, criminal, code, permanent, exile, in, a, walled, fortification, prison, the, cancellation, of, his, army, rank, and, military, degradation, also, known, as, cashiering, dreyfus, was, not, sentenced, to, death, as, it, had, been, abolished, for, political, crimes, since, 1848, for, the, authorities, the, press, and, the, public, doubts, had, been, dispelled, by, the, trial, and, his, guilt, was, certain, right, and, left, regretted, the, abolition, of, the, death, penalty, for, such, a, crime, antisemitism, peaked, in, the, press, and, occurred, in, areas, so, far, spared, socialist, leader, jean, jaur, s, regretted, the, lightness, of, the, sentence, in, an, address, to, the, chamber, of, deputies, and, wrote, a, soldier, has, been, sentenced, to, death, and, executed, for, throwing, a, button, in, the, face, of, his, corporal, so, why, leave, this, miserable, traitor, alive, radical, republican, georges, clemenceau, in, la, justice, made, a, similar, comment, on, 5, january, 1895, the, ceremony, of, degradation, took, place, in, the, morlan, court, of, the, military, school, in, paris, while, the, drums, rolled, dreyfus, was, accompanied, by, four, artillery, officers, who, brought, him, before, an, officer, of, the, state, who, read, the, judgment, a, republican, guard, adjutant, tore, off, his, badges, thin, strips, of, gold, his, stripes, cuffs, and, sleeves, of, his, jacket, as, he, was, paraded, throughout, the, streets, the, crowd, chanted, death, to, judas, death, to, the, jew, witnesses, report, the, dignity, of, dreyfus, who, continued, to, maintain, his, innocence, while, raising, his, arms, innocent, innocent, vive, la, france, long, live, the, army, the, adjutant, broke, his, sword, on, his, knee, and, then, the, condemned, dreyfus, marched, at, a, slow, pace, in, front, of, his, former, companions, an, event, known, as, the, legend, of, the, confession, took, place, before, the, degradation, in, the, van, that, brought, him, to, the, military, school, dreyfus, is, said, to, have, confided, his, treachery, to, captain, lebrun, renault, it, appears, that, this, was, merely, self, promotion, by, the, captain, of, the, republican, guard, and, that, in, reality, dreyfus, had, made, no, admission, due, to, the, affair, s, being, related, to, national, security, the, prisoner, was, then, held, in, solitary, confinement, in, a, cell, awaiting, transfer, on, 17, january, 1895, he, was, transferred, to, the, prison, on, le, de, r, where, he, was, held, for, over, a, month, he, had, the, right, to, see, his, wife, twice, a, week, in, a, long, room, each, of, them, at, one, end, with, the, director, of, the, prison, in, the, middle, at, the, last, minute, at, the, initiative, of, general, mercier, a, law, was, passed, on, 9, february, 1895, restoring, the, les, du, salut, in, french, guiana, as, a, place, of, fortified, deportation, so, that, dreyfus, was, not, sent, to, ducos, new, caledonia, indeed, during, the, deportation, of, adjutant, lucien, ch, telain, sentenced, for, conspiring, with, the, enemy, in, 1888, the, facilities, did, not, provide, the, required, conditions, of, confinement, and, detention, conditions, were, considered, too, soft, on, 21, february, 1895, dreyfus, embarked, on, the, ship, ville, de, saint, nazaire, the, next, day, the, ship, sailed, for, french, guiana, on, 12, march, 1895, after, a, difficult, voyage, of, fifteen, days, the, ship, anchored, off, the, les, du, salut, dreyfus, stayed, one, month, in, prison, on, le, royale, and, was, transferred, to, devil, s, island, on, 14, april, 1895, apart, from, his, guards, he, was, the, only, inhabitant, of, the, island, and, he, stayed, in, a, stone, hut, 4, by, 4, metres, 13, ft, 13, ft, haunted, by, the, risk, of, escape, the, commandant, of, the, prison, sentenced, him, to, a, hellish, life, even, though, living, conditions, were, already, very, painful, the, temperature, reached, 45, c, he, was, underfed, or, fed, contaminated, food, and, hardly, had, any, treatment, for, his, many, tropical, diseases, dreyfus, became, sick, and, shaken, by, fevers, that, got, worse, every, year, dreyfus, was, allowed, to, write, on, paper, numbered, and, signed, he, underwent, censorship, by, the, commandant, even, when, he, received, mail, from, his, wife, lucie, whereby, they, encouraged, each, other, on, 6, september, 1896, the, conditions, of, life, for, dreyfus, worsened, again, he, was, chained, double, looped, forcing, him, to, stay, in, bed, motionless, with, his, ankles, shackled, this, measure, was, the, result, of, false, information, of, his, escape, revealed, by, a, british, newspaper, for, two, long, months, dreyfus, was, plunged, into, deep, despair, convinced, that, his, life, would, end, on, this, remote, island, mathieu, dreyfus, the, elder, brother, of, alfred, was, convinced, of, his, innocence, he, was, the, chief, architect, of, the, rehabilitation, of, his, brother, and, spent, his, time, energy, and, fortune, to, gather, an, increasingly, powerful, movement, for, a, retrial, in, december, 1894, despite, the, difficulties, of, the, task, after, the, degradation, emptiness, was, around, us, it, seemed, to, us, that, we, were, no, longer, human, beings, like, others, we, were, cut, off, from, the, world, of, the, living, mathieu, tried, all, paths, even, the, most, fantastic, thanks, to, dr, gibert, a, friend, of, president, f, lix, faure, he, met, at, le, havre, a, woman, who, spoke, for, the, first, time, under, hypnosis, of, a, secret, file, this, fact, was, confirmed, by, the, president, of, the, republic, to, dr, gibert, in, a, private, conversation, little, by, little, despite, threats, of, arrest, for, complicity, machinations, and, entrapment, by, the, military, he, managed, to, convince, various, moderates, thus, the, anarchist, journalist, bernard, lazare, looked, into, the, proceedings, in, 1896, lazare, published, the, first, dreyfusard, booklet, in, brussels, this, publication, had, little, influence, on, the, political, and, intellectual, world, but, it, contained, so, much, detail, that, the, general, staff, suspected, that, picquart, the, new, head, of, sr, was, responsible, the, campaign, for, the, review, relayed, little, by, little, into, the, leftist, anti, military, press, triggered, a, return, of, a, violent, yet, vague, antisemitism, france, was, overwhelmingly, anti, dreyfusard, major, henry, from, the, statistics, section, in, turn, was, aware, of, the, thinness, of, the, prosecution, case, at, the, request, of, his, superiors, general, boisdeffre, chief, of, the, general, staff, and, major, general, gonse, he, was, charged, with, the, task, of, enlarging, the, file, to, prevent, any, attempt, at, a, review, unable, to, find, any, evidence, he, decided, to, build, some, after, the, fact, major, georges, picquart, was, assigned, to, be, head, of, the, staff, of, the, military, intelligence, service, sr, in, july, 1895, following, the, illness, of, colonel, sandherr, in, march, 1896, picquart, who, had, followed, the, dreyfus, affair, from, the, outset, now, required, to, receive, the, documents, stolen, from, the, german, embassy, directly, without, any, intermediary, he, discovered, a, document, called, the, petit, bleu, a, telegram, that, was, never, sent, written, by, von, schwarzkoppen, and, intercepted, at, the, german, embassy, at, the, beginning, of, march, 1896, it, was, addressed, to, a, french, officer, major, walsin, esterhazy, 27, rue, de, la, bienfaisance, paris, in, another, letter, in, black, pencil, von, schwarzkoppen, revealed, the, same, clandestine, relationship, with, esterhazy, on, seeing, letters, from, esterhazy, picquart, realized, with, amazement, that, his, writing, was, exactly, the, same, as, that, on, the, bordereau, which, had, been, used, to, incriminate, dreyfus, he, procured, the, secret, file, given, to, the, judges, in, 1894, and, was, astonished, by, the, lack, of, evidence, against, dreyfus, and, became, convinced, of, his, innocence, moved, by, his, discovery, picquart, diligently, conducted, an, enquiry, in, secret, without, the, consent, of, his, superiors, the, enquiry, demonstrated, that, esterhazy, had, knowledge, of, the, elements, described, by, the, bordereau, and, that, he, was, in, contact, with, the, german, embassy, it, was, established, that, the, officer, sold, the, germans, many, secret, documents, whose, value, was, quite, low, ferdinand, walsin, esterhazy, was, a, former, member, of, french, counterespionage, where, he, had, served, after, the, war, of, 1870, he, had, worked, in, the, same, office, as, major, henry, from, 1877, to, 1880, a, man, with, a, personality, disorder, a, sulphurous, reputation, and, crippled, by, debt, he, was, considered, by, picquart, to, be, a, traitor, driven, by, monetary, reasons, to, betray, his, country, picquart, communicated, the, results, of, his, investigation, to, the, general, staff, which, opposed, him, under, the, authority, of, the, principle, of, res, judicata, after, this, everything, was, done, to, oust, him, from, his, position, with, the, help, of, his, own, deputy, major, henry, it, was, primarily, the, upper, echelons, of, the, army, that, did, not, want, to, admit, that, dreyfus, s, conviction, could, be, a, grave, miscarriage, of, justice, for, mercier, then, zurlinden, and, the, general, staff, what, was, done, was, done, and, should, never, be, returned, to, they, found, it, convenient, to, separate, the, dreyfus, and, esterhazy, affairs, the, nationalist, press, launched, a, violent, campaign, against, the, burgeoning, dreyfusards, in, counter, attack, the, general, staff, discovered, and, revealed, the, information, hitherto, ignored, in, the, secret, file, doubt, began, to, surface, and, figures, in, the, artistic, and, political, spheres, asked, questions, picquart, tried, to, convince, his, seniors, to, react, in, favour, of, dreyfus, but, the, general, staff, seemed, deaf, an, investigation, was, started, against, him, he, was, monitored, when, he, was, in, the, east, then, transferred, to, tunisia, in, the, interest, of, the, service, at, this, moment, major, henry, chose, to, take, action, on, 1, november, 1896, he, created, a, false, document, subsequently, called, the, faux, henry, keeping, the, header, and, signature, of, an, ordinary, letter, from, panizzardi, and, wrote, the, central, text, himself, i, read, that, a, deputy, will, call, on, dreyfus, if, you, ask, further, explanations, from, rome, i, would, say, that, i, never, had, relations, with, the, jew, that, is, understood, if, asked, speak, like, that, because, that, person, should, never, know, what, happened, with, him, this, was, a, rather, crude, forgery, generals, gonse, and, boisdeffre, however, without, asking, questions, brought, the, letter, to, their, minister, general, jean, baptiste, billot, the, doubts, of, the, general, staff, regarding, the, innocence, of, dreyfus, flew, out, the, window, with, this, discovery, the, general, staff, decided, to, protect, esterhazy, and, persecute, colonel, picquart, who, did, not, understand, anything, picquart, who, knew, nothing, of, the, faux, henry, quickly, felt, isolated, from, his, fellow, soldiers, major, henry, accused, picquart, of, embezzlement, and, sent, him, a, letter, full, of, innuendo, he, protested, in, writing, and, returned, to, paris, picquart, confided, in, his, friend, lawyer, louis, leblois, who, promised, secrecy, leblois, however, spoke, to, the, vice, president, of, the, senate, the, alsatian, auguste, scheurer, kestner, born, in, mulhouse, like, dreyfus, who, was, in, turn, infected, by, doubts, without, citing, picquart, the, senator, revealed, the, affair, to, the, highest, people, in, the, country, the, general, staff, however, still, suspected, picquart, of, causing, leaks, this, was, the, beginning, of, the, picquart, affair, a, new, conspiracy, by, the, general, staff, against, an, officer, major, henry, although, deputy, to, picquart, was, jealous, and, fostered, his, own, malicious, operation, to, compromise, his, superior, he, engaged, in, various, malpractices, making, a, letter, and, designating, it, as, an, instrument, of, a, jewish, syndicate, wanting, to, help, dreyfus, to, escape, rigging, the, petit, bleu, to, create, a, belief, that, picquart, erased, the, name, of, the, real, recipient, drafting, a, letter, naming, dreyfus, in, full, parallel, to, the, investigations, of, picquart, the, defenders, of, dreyfus, were, informed, in, november, 1897, that, the, identity, of, the, writer, of, the, bordereau, was, esterhazy, mathieu, dreyfus, had, a, reproduction, of, the, bordereau, published, by, le, figaro, a, banker, castro, formally, identified, the, writing, as, that, of, esterhazy, who, was, his, debtor, and, told, mathieu, on, 11, november, 1897, the, two, paths, of, investigation, met, during, a, meeting, between, scheurer, kestner, and, mathieu, dreyfus, the, latter, finally, received, confirmation, that, esterhazy, was, the, author, of, the, note, based, on, this, on, 15, november, 1897, mathieu, dreyfus, made, a, complaint, to, the, minister, of, war, against, esterhazy, the, controversy, was, now, public, and, the, army, had, no, choice, but, to, open, an, investigation, at, the, end, of, 1897, picquart, returned, to, paris, and, made, public, his, doubts, about, the, guilt, of, dreyfus, because, of, his, discoveries, collusion, to, eliminate, picquart, seemed, to, have, failed, the, challenge, was, very, strong, and, turned, to, confrontation, to, discredit, picquart, esterhazy, sent, without, effect, letters, of, complaint, to, the, president, of, the, republic, the, dreyfusard, movement, led, by, bernard, lazare, mathieu, dreyfus, joseph, reinach, and, auguste, scheurer, kestner, gained, momentum, mile, zola, informed, in, mid, november, 1897, by, scheurer, kestner, with, documents, was, convinced, of, the, innocence, of, dreyfus, and, undertook, to, engage, himself, officially, on, 25, november, 1897, the, novelist, published, mr, scheurer, kestner, in, le, figaro, which, was, the, first, article, in, a, series, of, three, faced, with, threats, of, massive, cancellations, from, its, readers, the, paper, s, editor, stopped, supporting, zola, gradually, from, late, november, through, early, december, 1897, a, number, of, prominent, people, got, involved, in, the, fight, for, retrial, these, included, the, authors, octave, mirbeau, his, first, article, was, published, three, days, after, zola, and, anatole, france, academic, lucien, l, vy, bruhl, the, librarian, of, the, cole, normale, sup, rieure, lucien, herr, who, convinced, l, on, blum, and, jean, jaur, s, the, authors, of, la, revue, blanche, where, lazare, knew, the, director, thadee, natanson, and, the, clemenceau, brothers, albert, and, georges, blum, tried, in, late, november, 1897, to, sign, with, his, friend, maurice, barr, s, a, petition, calling, for, a, retrial, but, barr, s, refused, broke, with, zola, and, blum, in, early, december, and, began, to, popularize, the, term, intellectuals, this, first, break, was, the, prelude, to, a, division, among, the, educated, elite, after, 13, january, 1898, the, dreyfus, affair, occupied, more, and, more, discussions, something, the, political, world, did, not, always, recognize, jules, m, line, declared, in, the, opening, session, of, the, national, assembly, on, 7, december, 1897, there, is, no, dreyfus, affair, there, is, not, now, and, there, can, be, no, dreyfus, affair, general, georges, gabriel, de, pellieux, was, responsible, for, conducting, an, investigation, it, was, brief, thanks, to, the, general, staff, s, skillful, manipulation, of, the, investigator, the, real, culprit, they, said, was, lieutenant, colonel, picquart, the, investigation, was, moving, towards, a, predictable, conclusion, until, esterhazy, s, former, mistress, madame, de, boulancy, published, letters, in, le, figaro, in, which, ten, years, earlier, esterhazy, had, expressed, violently, his, hatred, for, france, and, his, contempt, for, the, french, army, the, militarist, press, rushed, to, the, rescue, of, esterhazy, with, an, unprecedented, antisemitic, campaign, the, dreyfusard, press, replied, with, strong, new, evidence, in, its, possession, georges, clemenceau, in, the, newspaper, l, aurore, asked, who, protects, major, esterhazy, the, law, must, stop, sucking, up, to, this, ineffectual, prussian, disguised, as, a, french, officer, why, who, trembles, before, esterhazy, what, occult, power, why, shamefully, oppose, the, action, of, justice, what, stands, in, the, way, why, is, esterhazy, a, character, of, depravity, and, more, than, doubtful, morals, protected, while, the, accused, is, not, why, is, an, honest, soldier, such, as, lieutenant, colonel, picquart, discredited, overwhelmed, dishonoured, if, this, is, the, case, we, must, speak, out, although, protected, by, the, general, staff, and, therefore, by, the, government, esterhazy, was, obliged, to, admit, authorship, of, the, francophobe, letters, published, by, le, figaro, this, convinced, the, office, of, the, general, staff, to, find, a, way, to, stop, the, questions, doubts, and, the, beginnings, of, demands, for, justice, the, idea, was, to, require, esterhazy, to, demand, a, trial, and, be, acquitted, to, stop, the, noise, and, allow, a, return, to, order, thus, to, finally, exonerate, him, according, to, the, old, rule, res, judicata, pro, veritate, habetur, esterhazy, was, set, to, appear, before, a, military, court, on, 10, january, 1898, a, delayed, closed, court, trial, was, pronounced, esterhazy, was, notified, of, the, matter, on, the, following, day, along, with, guidance, on, the, defensive, line, to, take, the, trial, was, not, normal, the, civil, trial, mathieu, and, lucy, dreyfus, requested, was, denied, and, the, three, handwriting, experts, decided, the, writing, in, the, bordereau, was, not, esterhazy, s, the, accused, was, applauded, and, the, witnesses, booed, and, jeered, pellieux, intervened, to, defend, the, general, staff, without, legal, substance, the, real, accused, was, picquart, who, was, dishonoured, by, all, the, military, protagonists, of, the, affair, esterhazy, was, acquitted, unanimously, the, next, day, after, just, three, minutes, of, deliberation, with, all, the, cheering, it, was, difficult, for, esterhazy, to, make, his, way, toward, the, exit, where, some, 1, 500, people, were, waiting, by, error, an, innocent, person, was, convicted, but, on, order, the, guilty, party, was, acquitted, for, many, moderate, republicans, it, was, an, intolerable, infringement, of, the, fundamental, values, they, defended, the, acquittal, of, esterhazy, therefore, brought, about, a, change, of, strategy, for, the, dreyfusards, liberalism, friendly, scheurer, kestner, and, reinach, took, more, combative, and, rebellious, action, in, response, to, the, acquittal, large, and, violent, riots, by, anti, dreyfusards, and, antisemites, broke, out, across, france, flush, with, victory, the, general, staff, arrested, picquart, on, charges, of, violation, of, professional, secrecy, following, the, disclosure, of, his, investigation, through, his, lawyer, who, revealed, it, to, senator, scheurer, kestner, the, colonel, although, placed, under, arrest, at, fort, mont, val, rien, did, not, give, up, and, involved, himself, further, in, the, affair, when, mathieu, thanked, him, he, replied, curtly, that, he, was, doing, his, duty, esterhazy, benefited, from, special, treatment, by, the, upper, echelons, of, the, army, which, was, inexplicable, except, for, the, general, staff, s, desire, to, stifle, any, inclination, to, challenge, the, verdict, of, the, court, martial, that, had, convicted, dreyfus, in, 1894, the, army, declared, esterhazy, unfit, for, service, to, avoid, personal, risk, esterhazy, shaved, off, his, prominent, moustache, and, went, into, exile, in, england, rachel, beer, editor, of, the, observer, and, the, sunday, times, english, newspapers, knew, that, esterhazy, was, in, london, because, the, observer, s, paris, correspondent, had, made, a, connection, with, him, she, interviewed, him, twice, and, he, confessed, to, being, the, culprit, i, wrote, the, bordereau, she, published, the, interviews, in, september, 1898, reporting, his, confession, and, writing, a, leader, column, accusing, the, french, military, of, antisemitism, and, calling, for, a, retrial, for, dreyfus, esterhazy, lived, comfortably, in, england, until, his, death, in, 1923, on, 13, january, 1898, mile, zola, touched, off, a, new, dimension, in, the, dreyfus, affair, which, became, known, simply, as, the, affair, the, first, great, dreyfusard, intellectual, zola, was, at, the, height, of, his, glory, the, twenty, volumes, of, the, les, rougon, macquart, epic, were, being, distributed, in, dozens, of, countries, he, was, a, leader, in, the, literary, world, and, was, fully, conscious, of, it, to, general, pellieux, he, said, at, his, trial, i, ask, general, pellieux, if, there, are, not, many, ways, to, serve, france, it, can, be, served, by, the, sword, or, by, the, pen, general, pellieux, has, probably, won, great, victories, i, have, won, mine, too, by, my, work, the, french, language, has, been, brought, into, the, world, i, have, my, victories, i, bequeath, to, posterity, the, name, of, general, pellieux, and, that, of, mile, zola, history, will, choose, outraged, by, the, acquittal, of, esterhazy, zola, published, a, 4, 500, word, article, on, the, front, page, of, l, aurore, in, the, form, of, an, open, letter, to, president, f, lix, faure, clemenceau, thought, up, the, headline, j, accuse, with, a, typical, circulation, of, 30, 000, the, newspaper, distributed, nearly, 300, 000, copies, that, day, this, article, had, the, effect, of, an, explosion, the, article, was, a, direct, attack, explicit, and, clear, and, named, names, it, denounced, all, those, who, had, conspired, against, dreyfus, including, the, minister, of, war, and, the, general, staff, the, article, contained, numerous, errors, exaggerating, or, minimizing, the, roles, of, one, or, another, of, the, figures, involved, the, role, of, general, mercier, was, greatly, underestimated, for, instance, j, accuse, provided, for, the, first, time, a, compilation, of, all, existing, data, on, the, affair, in, one, place, zola, s, goal, was, to, make, himself, a, target, to, force, the, authorities, to, prosecute, him, his, trial, forced, a, new, public, review, of, both, the, dreyfus, and, esterhazy, affairs, here, he, went, against, the, strategy, of, scheurer, kestner, and, lazare, who, advocated, patience, and, reflection, thanks, to, the, national, and, international, success, of, zola, s, article, a, trial, became, inevitable, from, that, critical, moment, the, case, followed, two, parallel, paths, on, one, hand, the, state, used, its, apparatus, to, impose, a, limitation, on, the, trial, restricting, it, to, one, of, simple, libel, so, as, to, separate, the, dreyfus, and, esterhazy, cases, which, had, already, been, adjudicated, on, the, other, hand, conflicting, camps, of, opinion, tried, to, influence, judges, and, the, government, one, side, pushed, to, obtain, a, review, and, the, other, to, convict, zola, but, zola, achieved, his, aim, the, opening, of, a, public, debate, at, the, assize, court, on, 15, january, 1898, le, temps, published, a, petition, calling, for, a, retrial, it, included, the, names, of, mile, zola, anatole, france, director, of, the, pasteur, institute, mile, duclaux, daniel, hal, vy, fernand, gregh, f, lix, f, n, on, marcel, proust, lucien,

monod, on, 20, january, 1898, after, an, anti, zola, speech, by, rightist, politician, albert, de, mun, at, the, chamber, of, deputies, the, chamber, voted, 312, 22, to, prosecute, zola, on, 23, january, 1898, clemenceau, in, the, name, of, a, peaceful, revolt, of, the, french, spirit, picked, up, the, term, intellectuals, and, used, it, in, l, aurore, but, in, a, positive, sense, on, 1, february, 1898, barres, lambasted, the, intellectuals, in, le, journal, anti, intellectualism, became, a, major, theme, of, right, wing, intellectuals, who, accused, the, dreyfusards, of, failing, to, put, the, nation, s, interests, first, an, argument, that, continued, throughout, the, years, that, followed, and, which, became, the, basis, of, the, public, debate, a, choice, between, justice, and, truth, on, the, one, hand, and, the, defense, of, the, nation, preservation, of, society, and, superiority, of, the, state, on, the, other, at, first, the, political, left, did, not, echo, this, mobilization, of, intellectuals, on, 19, january, 1898, socialist, deputies, distanced, themselves, from, the, two, rival, bourgeois, factions, general, billot, minister, of, war, filed, a, complaint, against, zola, and, alexandre, perrenx, the, manager, of, l, aurore, to, be, heard, at, the, assises, of, the, seine, from, 7, to, 23, february, 1898, defamation, of, a, public, authority, was, liable, to, trial, in, the, cour, d, assises, while, insults, to, private, figures, such, as, journalists, and, intellectuals, uttered, by, the, nationalist, and, antisemitic, press, were, limited, to, the, civil, adversarial, system, the, taxpayer, is, at, risk, in, the, first, case, while, only, the, plaintiff, is, at, risk, in, the, second, the, minister, referred, to, only, three, passages, of, zola, s, article, eighteen, lines, out, of, hundreds, he, accused, zola, of, having, written, that, the, court, martial, had, committed, unlawful, acts, by, order, the, trial, opened, in, an, atmosphere, of, extreme, violence, zola, had, been, the, object, of, the, most, shameful, attacks, as, well, as, important, support, and, congratulations, on, 2, february, octave, mirbeau, laurent, tailhade, pierre, quillard, and, georges, courteline, among, others, in, l, aurore, signed, an, address, to, mile, zola, assuring, him, of, their, support, in, the, name, of, justice, and, truth, fernand, labori, zola, s, lawyer, intended, to, call, about, 200, witnesses, the, details, of, the, dreyfus, affair, unknown, to, most, of, the, public, were, published, in, the, press, several, papers, le, siecle, and, l, urore, among, others, published, shorthand, notes, verbatim, of, the, debates, every, day, to, build, support, in, the, population, these, notes, were, for, the, dreyfusards, an, essential, tool, for, later, debates, the, nationalists, behind, henri, rochefort, however, were, more, visible, and, organized, riots, which, forced, the, prefect, of, police, to, intervene, to, protect, zola, whenever, he, left, the, facility, after, every, hearing, this, trial, was, also, the, scene, of, a, real, legal, battle, in, which, the, rights, of, the, defence, were, constantly, violated, many, observers, were, aware, of, the, collusion, between, france, s, political, and, military, worlds, evidently, the, court, received, instructions, not, to, raise, the, subject, of, former, judicial, errors, president, delegorgue, on, the, pretext, of, the, long, duration, of, the, hearings, juggled, the, law, incessantly, to, ensure, that, the, trial, dealt, only, with, the, alleged, defamation, by, zola, delegorgue, s, phrase, the, question, will, not, be, put, was, repeated, dozens, of, times, zola, was, sentenced, to, one, year, in, prison, and, a, fine, of, 3, 000, francs, which, was, the, maximum, penalty, this, harshness, was, due, to, the, atmosphere, of, violence, surrounding, the, trial, the, excitement, of, the, audience, and, the, exasperation, of, the, crowd, in, front, of, the, courthouse, were, so, violent, that, one, could, fear, the, worst, excesses, if, the, jury, acquitted, mr, zola, however, the, zola, trial, was, rather, a, victory, for, the, dreyfusards, indeed, the, affair, and, its, contradictions, had, been, widely, discussed, throughout, the, trial, especially, by, the, military, in, addition, the, violent, attacks, against, zola, and, the, injustice, of, the, conviction, of, dreyfus, reinforced, the, commitment, of, the, dreyfusards, st, phane, mallarm, declared, imbued, by, the, admirable, actions, and, jules, renard, wrote, in, his, diary, from, tonight, i, hold, on, to, the, republic, that, inspires, respect, in, me, a, tenderness, in, me, that, i, do, not, know, i, declare, that, justice, is, the, most, beautiful, word, in, the, language, of, men, and, i, must, cry, if, men, no, longer, understand, it, senator, ludovic, trarieux, and, catholic, jurist, paul, viollet, founded, the, league, for, the, defence, of, human, rights, even, more, than, the, dreyfus, affair, the, zola, affair, resulted, in, a, regrouping, of, intellectual, forces, into, two, opposing, camps, on, 2, april, 1898, an, application, to, the, supreme, court, received, a, favourable, response, this, was, the, court, s, first, intervention, in, the, affair, the, court, upheld, the, appeal, on, the, formal, grounds, that, as, the, alleged, libel, was, against, the, military, court, rather, than, the, minister, it, was, the, military, court, that, should, have, made, the, complaint, prosecutor, general, manau, supported, a, review, of, the, dreyfus, trial, and, strongly, opposed, the, antisemites, the, judges, of, the, military, court, whom, zola, had, challenged, therefore, opened, a, new, suit, against, him, for, libel, the, case, was, brought, before, the, assizes, of, seine, et, oise, in, versailles, where, the, public, was, considered, more, favourable, to, the, army, and, more, nationalistic, on, 23, may, 1898, at, the, first, hearing, mr, labori, appealed, to, the, supreme, court, regarding, the, change, of, jurisdiction, which, adjourned, the, trial, and, postponed, the, hearing, to, 18, july, 1898, labori, advised, zola, to, leave, france, for, england, before, the, end, of, the, trial, which, the, writer, did, departing, for, a, one, year, exile, in, england, the, defendants, were, convicted, again, as, for, colonel, picquart, he, found, himself, again, in, prison, antisemitic, disturbances, and, riots, broke, out, in, 1898, in, cities, across, metropolitan, france, mostly, in, january, and, february, antisemitic, riots, predated, the, dreyfus, affair, and, were, almost, a, tradition, in, the, east, which, the, alsatian, people, observed, upon, the, outbreak, of, any, revolution, in, france, but, the, 1898, disturbances, were, much, more, widespread, there, were, three, waves, of, unrest, in, 55, localities, the, first, ending, the, week, of, 23, january, the, second, wave, in, the, week, following, and, the, third, wave, from, 23, 28, february, these, waves, and, other, incidents, totaled, 69, riots, or, disturbances, across, the, country, additionally, riots, took, place, in, algeria, from, 18, 25, january, demonstrators, at, these, disturbances, threw, stones, chanted, slogans, attacked, jewish, property, and, sometimes, jewish, people, and, resisted, police, efforts, to, stop, them, mayors, called, for, calm, and, troops, including, cavalry, were, called, in, an, attempt, to, quell, the, disturbances, zola, s, j, accuse, appeared, on, 13, january, and, most, historians, suggest, that, the, riots, were, spontaneous, reactions, to, its, publication, and, to, the, subsequent, zola, trial, the, press, reported, that, tumultuous, demonstrations, broke, out, nearly, every, day, prefects, or, police, in, various, towns, noted, demonstrations, in, their, localities, and, associated, them, with, the, campaign, undertaken, in, favor, of, ex, captain, dreyfus, or, with, the, intervention, by, m, zola, or, the, zola, trial, itself, which, seems, to, have, aroused, the, antisemitic, demonstrations, in, paris, demonstrations, around, the, zola, trial, were, frequent, and, sometimes, violent, roger, martin, du, gard, reported, that, individuals, with, jewish, features, were, grabbed, surrounded, and, roughed, up, by, delirious, youths, who, danced, round, them, brandishing, flaming, torches, made, from, rolled, up, copies, of, l, aurore, however, the, fervid, reaction, to, the, dreyfus, affair, and, especially, the, zola, trial, was, only, partly, spontaneous, in, a, dozen, cities, including, nantes, lille, and, le, havre, antisemitic, posters, appeared, in, the, streets, and, riots, followed, soon, after, at, saint, etienne, posters, read, imitate, your, brothers, of, paris, lyon, marseille, nantes, toulouse, join, with, them, in, demonstrating, against, the, underhand, attacks, being, made, on, the, nation, in, caen, marseille, and, other, cities, riots, followed, antisemitic, speeches, or, meetings, such, as, the, meeting, organized, by, the, comit, de, d, fense, religieuse, et, sociale, in, caen, the, acquittal, of, esterhazy, the, convictions, of, mile, zola, and, of, georges, picquart, and, the, continued, presence, of, an, innocent, man, in, prison, had, a, considerable, national, and, international, effect, france, was, exposed, as, an, arbitrary, state, which, contradicted, its, founding, republican, principles, antisemitism, made, considerable, progress, and, riots, were, common, throughout, the, year, 1898, however, politicians, were, still, in, denial, about, the, affair, in, april, and, may, 1898, they, were, mostly, concerned, with, elections, in, which, jaur, s, lost, his, seat, of, carmaux, the, majority, was, moderate, though, a, parliamentary, group, in, the, house, was, antisemitic, nevertheless, the, cause, of, the, dreyfusards, was, restarted, godefroy, cavaignac, the, new, minister, of, war, and, a, fierce, supporter, of, anti, revisionism, definitely, wanted, to, prove, the, guilt, of, dreyfus, and, from, there, wring, the, neck, of, esterhazy, whom, he, considered, a, pathological, liar, and, blackmailer, he, was, absolutely, convinced, of, dreyfus, s, guilt, a, conviction, reinforced, by, the, legend, of, the, confession, after, meeting, the, main, witness, captain, lebrun, renault, cavaignac, had, the, honesty, of, a, doctrinaire, intransigent, but, absolutely, did, not, know, the, depths, of, the, affair, the, general, staff, had, kept, him, in, the, dark, he, was, surprised, to, learn, that, all, the, documents, on, which, the, prosecution, was, based, had, not, been, expertly, appraised, and, that, boisdeffre, had, absolute, confidence, in, henry, cavaignac, decided, to, investigate, in, his, office, with, his, assistants, and, retrieved, the, secret, file, which, now, contained, 365, items, on, 4, april, the, newspaper, le, si, cle, published, lettre, d, un, diplomate, the, first, of, four, documents, that, were, of, critical, importance, in, exposing, esterhazy, s, guilt, and, enabled, the, dreyfusard, cause, to, regain, the, initiative, it, had, lost, with, zola, s, conviction, the, secret, information, had, been, provided, by, zola, who, had, received, it, from, oscar, wilde, wilde, had, gained, it, from, best, friend, carlos, blacker, who, was, an, intimate, friend, of, alessandro, panizzardi, on, 7, july, 1898, during, a, questioning, in, the, national, assembly, cavaignac, reported, three, items, overwhelming, among, a, thousand, two, of, which, had, no, connection, with, the, case, the, other, was, the, faux, henry, cavaignac, s, speech, was, effective, the, d, put, s, deputies, gave, him, an, ovation, and, voted, to, display, copies, of, the, three, documents, in, the, 36, 000, communes, of, france, the, anti, dreyfusards, had, triumphed, but, cavaignac, implicitly, recognized, that, the, dreyfus, s, defence, had, not, had, access, to, all, the, evidence, the, application, for, annulment, made, by, lucie, dreyfus, became, admissible, the, next, day, picquart, declared, in, le, temps, to, the, council, president, i, am, in, a, position, to, establish, before, a, court, of, competent, jurisdiction, that, the, two, documents, bearing, the, date, of, 1894, could, not, be, attributed, to, dreyfus, and, that, the, one, that, bears, the, date, of, 1896, had, all, the, characteristics, of, a, fake, which, earned, him, eleven, months, in, prison, on, the, evening, of, 13, august, 1898, louis, cuignet, who, was, attached, to, the, cabinet, of, cavaignac, was, working, by, the, light, of, a, lamp, and, observed, that, the, colour, of, the, lines, on, the, faux, henry, paper, header, and, footer, did, not, correspond, with, the, central, part, of, the, document, cavaignac, was, still, trying, to, find, logical, reasons, for, the, guilt, and, conviction, of, dreyfus, but, was, not, silent, on, this, discovery, a, board, of, inquiry, was, formed, to, investigate, esterhazy, before, which, he, panicked, and, confessed, his, secret, reports, to, major, du, paty, de, clam, collusion, between, the, general, staff, and, the, traitor, was, revealed, on, 30, august, 1898, cavaignac, resigned, himself, to, demanding, explanations, from, colonel, henry, in, the, presence, of, boisdeffre, and, gonse, after, an, hour, of, questioning, by, the, minister, himself, henry, broke, down, and, made, a, full, confession, he, was, placed, under, arrest, at, the, mont, val, rien, fortress, where, he, killed, himself, the, next, day, by, cutting, his, own, throat, with, a, razor, the, request, for, review, filed, by, lucie, dreyfus, could, not, be, rejected, yet, cavaignac, said, less, than, ever, but, the, president, of, the, council, henri, brisson, forced, him, to, resign, despite, his, apparently, entirely, involuntary, role, in, the, revision, of, the, 1894, trial, cavaignac, remained, convinced, that, dreyfus, was, guilty, and, made, a, statement, disparaging, and, offensive, to, dreyfus, at, the, rennes, trial, the, anti, revisionists, did, not, consider, themselves, beaten, on, 6, september, 1898, charles, maurras, published, a, eulogy, of, henry, in, la, gazette, de, france, in, which, he, called, him, a, heroic, servant, of, the, great, interests, of, the, state, la, libre, parole, drumont, s, antisemitic, newspaper, spread, the, notion, of, patriotic, fake, faux, patriotique, in, december, the, same, newspaper, launched, a, subscription, in, favour, of, his, widow, to, erect, a, monument, to, henry, each, gift, was, accompanied, by, pithy, often, abusive, remarks, on, dreyfus, the, dreyfusards, and, the, jews, some, 14, 000, subscribers, including, 53, deputies, sent, 131, 000, francs, on, 3, september, 1898, brisson, the, president, of, the, council, urged, mathieu, dreyfus, to, file, an, application, for, review, of, the, military, court, of, 1894, the, government, transferred, the, case, to, the, supreme, court, for, its, opinion, on, the, past, four, years, of, proceedings, france, was, thoroughly, divided, into, two, but, several, things, remain, clear, the, jewish, community, had, little, involvement, intellectuals, were, not, all, dreyfusards, the, protestants, were, divided, and, marxists, refused, to, support, dreyfus, the, split, transcended, religion, and, social, background, as, shown, in, a, cartoon, by, caran, d, ache, a, family, dinner, before, above, all, never, talk, about, it, after, they, talked, about, it, henry, was, dead, boisdeffre, had, resigned, gonse, had, no, more, authority, and, du, paty, had, been, severely, compromised, by, esterhazy, for, the, conspirators, it, was, a, d, b, cle, the, government, was, now, caught, between, two, fires, the, nationalist, pressure, on, the, street, and, the, higher, command, cavaignac, having, resigned, for, continuing, to, spread, his, anti, dreyfusard, vision, of, the, affair, arose, as, an, anti, revisionist, leader, general, zurlinden, who, succeeded, him, and, was, influenced, by, the, general, staff, delivered, a, negative, opinion, at, the, review, on, 10, september, 1898, comforting, the, extremist, press, by, saying, that, a, review, means, war, the, obstinacy, of, the, government, who, voted, to, revert, to, the, supreme, court, on, 26, september, 1898, led, to, the, resignation, of, zurlinden, who, was, soon, replaced, by, general, chanoine, when, chanoine, was, questioned, in, the, house, he, handed, in, his, resignation, trust, was, denied, to, brisson, and, he, was, also, forced, to, resign, ministerial, instability, caused, some, governmental, instability, on, 1, november, 1898, the, progressive, charles, dupuy, was, appointed, in, place, of, brisson, in, 1894, he, had, covered, the, actions, of, general, mercier, at, the, beginning, of, the, dreyfus, affair, and, four, years, later, he, announced, that, he, would, follow, the, judgment, of, the, supreme, court, thus, blocking, the, road, for, those, who, wanted, to, stifle, the, review, and, divest, the, court, on, 5, december, 1898, in, the, shadow, of, a, debate, in, the, house, on, the, transmission, of, the, secret, file, to, the, supreme, court, the, tension, rose, another, notch, insults, invective, and, other, nationalistic, violence, gave, way, to, threats, of, an, uprising, paul, d, roul, de, declared, if, there, has, to, be, a, civil, war, so, be, it, a, new, crisis, arose, at, the, same, time, in, the, heart, of, the, supreme, court, since, quesnay, de, beaurepaire, president, of, the, civil, chamber, accused, the, criminal, chamber, of, dreyfusism, in, the, press, he, resigned, on, 8, january, 1899, as, a, hero, of, the, nationalist, cause, this, crisis, led, to, the, divestiture, of, the, criminal, division, in, favour, of, joint, chambers, this, was, the, point, of, blockage, for, the, review, in, 1899, the, dreyfus, affair, took, up, more, and, more, of, the, political, scene, on, 16, february, 1899, f, lix, faure, the, president, of, france, died, of, a, heart, attack, mile, loubet, was, elected, which, was, an, advance, for, the, cause, of, the, review, as, the, previous, president, had, been, a, fierce, opponent, on, 23, february, 1899, at, the, funeral, for, faure, paul, d, roul, de, attempted, to, force, a, coup, at, the, lys, e, palace, it, was, a, failure, as, it, was, not, supported, by, the, military, on, 4, june, 1899, loubet, was, assaulted, at, the, longchamp, racecourse, these, provocations, plus, permanent, demonstrations, from, the, extreme, right, although, it, never, actually, put, the, republic, in, danger, created, a, burst, of, republicanism, leading, to, the, formation, of, a, government, of, republican, defence, around, waldeck, rousseau, on, 22, june, 1899, the, center, of, french, politics, including, raymond, poincar, had, aligned, itself, with, the, pro, revisionists, the, progressive, anti, dreyfusard, republicans, such, as, jules, m, line, were, rejected, outright, the, dreyfus, affair, led, to, a, clear, reorganization, of, the, french, political, landscape, the, supreme, court, considered, the, dreyfus, affair, in, the, context, of, press, campaigns, against, the, criminal, division, the, magistrates, being, constantly, dragged, through, the, mud, in, nationalist, newspapers, from, the, panama, scandals, on, 26, september, 1898, after, a, cabinet, vote, the, minister, of, justice, appealed, to, the, supreme, court, on, 29, october, 1898, after, the, submission, of, the, report, from, the, recorder, alphonse, bard, the, criminal, chamber, of, the, court, stated, that, the, application, is, admissible, and, will, proceed, with, a, supplementary, investigation, the, recorder, louis, loew, presided, he, was, subjected, to, a, very, violent, campaign, of, antisemitic, insults, due, to, his, being, an, alsatian, protestant, accused, of, being, a, deserter, and, tainted, by, the, prussians, despite, the, compliant, silence, of, mercier, billot, zurlinden, and, roget, who, hid, behind, the, authority, of, already, judged, and, state, secret, understanding, of, the, affair, increased, cavaignac, made, a, statement, two, days, long, but, failed, to, prove, the, guilt, of, dreyfus, on, the, contrary, he, unwittingly, exonerated, him, by, a, demonstration, of, the, exact, date, of, the, bordereau, august, 1894, picquart, then, demonstrated, all, the, workings, of, the, error, then, the, conspiracy, in, a, decision, dated, 8, december, 1898, in, response, to, his, divestiture, announcement, picquart, was, protected, from, the, military, court, by, the, criminal, division, of, the, supreme, court, this, was, a, new, obstacle, to, the, wishes, of, the, general, staff, a, new, furiously, antisemitic, press, campaign, burst, during, the, event, while, l, aurore, on, 29, october, 1898, published, an, article, entitled, victory, in, the, same, character, as, j, accuse, the, work, of, the, investigation, was, still, to, be, taken, back, by, the, criminal, division, the, secret, file, was, analyzed, from, 30, december, 1898, and, the, criminal, division, requested, disclosure, of, diplomatic, records, which, was, granted, on, 9, february, 1899, the, criminal, division, submitted, its, report, by, highlighting, two, important, facts, it, was, certain, esterhazy, used, the, same, paper, as, the, bordereau, and, the, secret, file, was, completely, void, these, two, major, events, alone, destroyed, all, proceedings, against, alfred, dreyfus, in, parallel, president, mazeau, conducted, an, inquiry, by, the, criminal, division, which, led, to, divestiture, thereof, to, not, only, leave, it, to, bear, alone, all, responsibility, for, the, final, decision, so, protecting, the, criminal, division, from, actions, arising, from, its, report, on, 28, february, 1899, waldeck, rousseau, spoke, to, the, senate, on, the, floor, and, denounced, moral, conspiracy, within, the, government, and, in, the, street, the, review, was, no, longer, avoidable, on, 1, march, 1899, alexis, ballot, beaupr, the, new, president, of, the, civil, chamber, of, the, supreme, court, was, appointed, recorder, for, the, consideration, of, the, application, for, review, he, took, on, the, legal, files, and, decided, on, a, further, investigation, ten, additional, witnesses, were, interviewed, which, further, weakened, the, version, of, the, general, staff, in, the, final, discussion, president, ballot, beaupr, demonstrated, the, inanity, of, the, bordereau, which, was, the, only, evidence, against, dreyfus, the, prosecutor, manau, echoed, the, views, of, the, president, mornard, who, represented, lucie, dreyfus, argued, without, any, difficulty, or, opposition, from, the, prosecution, on, 3, june, 1899, the, joint, chambers, of, the, supreme, court, overturned, the, judgment, of, 1894, in, a, formal, hearing, the, case, was, referred, to, the, military, court, of, rennes, by, that, judgment, the, supreme, court, imposed, itself, as, an, absolute, authority, capable, of, standing, up, to, military, and, political, power, for, many, dreyfusards, this, ruling, was, the, prelude, to, the, acquittal, of, the, captain, they, forgot, to, consider, that, it, was, again, the, army, who, would, judge, the, court, in, overturning, the, judgement, believed, in, the, legal, autonomy, of, the, military, court, without, taking, into, account, the, laws, of, esprit, de, corps, hannah, arendt, writes, that, fear, of, an, international, boycott, of, the, paris, exposition, of, 1900, was, what, united, the, disrupted, country, turned, parliament, in, favor, of, a, retrial, and, eventually, reconciled, disparate, elements, of, france, in, a, way, clemenceau, s, daily, editorials, zola, s, pathos, jaur, s, speeches, and, popular, hatred, of, the, clergy, and, aristocracy, had, not, alfred, dreyfus, was, in, no, way, aware, of, what, was, happening, thousands, of, kilometres, from, him, neither, was, he, aware, of, the, schemes, hatched, to, guarantee, that, he, could, never, return, or, the, commitment, of, countless, men, and, women, to, his, cause, the, prison, administration, filtered, information, deemed, confidential, at, the, end, of, 1898, he, learned, with, astonishment, the, actual, size, of, the, affair, about, which, he, knew, nothing, the, accusation, by, his, brother, against, esterhazy, the, acquittal, of, the, traitor, henry, s, confession, and, suicide, and, the, reading, of, the, record, of, investigations, of, the, supreme, court, which, he, received, two, months, after, its, publication, on, 5, june, 1899, alfred, dreyfus, was, notified, of, the, decision, of, the, supreme, court, on, the, judgement, of, 1894, on, 9, june, 1899, he, left, devil, s, island, heading, to, france, but, locked, in, a, cabin, as, if, guilty, even, though, he, no, longer, was, he, disembarked, on, 30, june, 1899, in, port, haliguen, on, the, quiberon, peninsula, in, the, greatest, secrecy, a, clandestine, and, nocturnal, return, after, five, years, of, imprisonment, he, was, on, his, native, soil, but, he, was, immediately, locked, up, from, 1, july, 1899, in, the, military, prison, in, rennes, he, was, remanded, on, 7, august, 1899, before, the, military, court, of, the, breton, capital, general, mercier, champion, of, the, anti, dreyfusards, intervened, constantly, in, the, press, to, confirm, the, accuracy, of, the, first, judgement, dreyfus, was, surely, guilty, immediately, however, dissent, emerged, in, the, defence, of, dreyfus, his, two, lawyers, actually, had, opposing, strategies, demange, wanted, to, stand, on, the, defensive, and, just, get, the, acquittal, of, dreyfus, labori, a, brilliant, lawyer, who, was, just, 35, years, old, wanted, to, take, the, offensive, to, aim, higher, and, defeat, and, publicly, humiliate, the, general, staff, mathieu, dreyfus, imagined, a, complementarity, between, the, two, lawyers, the, conduct, of, the, trial, revealed, the, disunity, that, served, the, prosecution, with, a, defence, so, impaired, the, trial, opened, on, 7, august, 1899, in, an, atmosphere, of, extreme, tension, rennes, was, in, a, state, of, siege, the, judges, of, the, court, martial, were, under, pressure, esterh, zy, who, admitted, authorship, of, the, bordereau, was, in, exile, in, england, he, and, du, paty, were, both, excused, on, the, appearance, of, dreyfus, emotions, ran, high, his, physical, appearance, disturbed, his, supporters, and, some, of, his, opponents, despite, his, deteriorated, physical, condition, he, had, a, complete, mastery, of, the, files, acquired, in, only, a, few, weeks, all, the, general, staff, testified, against, dreyfus, without, providing, any, proof, they, stubbornly, considered, null, and, void, the, confessions, of, henry, and, esterhazy, the, trial, even, tended, to, go, out, of, control, to, the, extent, that, the, decisions, of, the, supreme, court, were, not, taken, into, account, they, discussed, in, particular, the, bordereau, which, was, the, proof, of, guilt, of, esterhazy, nevertheless, mercier, was, booed, at, the, end, of, the, hearing, the, nationalist, press, and, the, anti, dreyfusards, could, only, speculate, on, his, silence, about, the, conclusive, evidence, the, pseudo, note, annotated, by, emperor, wilhelm, ii, which, nobody, will, ever, see, in, evidence, that, he, had, not, ceased, to, report, before, the, trial, on, 14, august, 1899, labori, was, on, his, way, to, court, when, he, was, shot, in, the, back, by, an, extremist, who, escaped, and, was, never, found, the, lawyer, was, missing, from, discussions, for, over, a, week, at, the, decisive, moment, of, the, examination, of, witnesses, on, 22, august, 1899, his, condition, had, improved, and, he, returned, incidents, between, the, two, lawyers, for, dreyfus, multiplied, labori, reproached, demange, about, his, excessive, caution, the, government, in, the, face, of, the, military, hardening, stance, still, had, two, ways, to, influence, events, call, for, testimony, from, germany, or, abandon, the, charge, these, negotiations, in, the, background, however, had, no, result, the, german, embassy, sent, a, polite, refusal, to, the, government, the, minister, of, war, general, gaston, de, galliffet, sent, respectful, word, to, major, louis, carri, re, the, government, commissioner, he, asked, him, to, act, in, the, spirit, of, the, revised, judgment, of, the, supreme, court, the, officer, pretended, not, to, understand, the, allusion, and, helped, the, nationalist, lawyer, auffray, to, make, the, indictment, against, dreyfus, the, defence, needed, to, make, a, decision, because, the, outcome, of, the, case, looked, bad, despite, evidence, of, the, absence, of, charges, against, the, accused, on, behalf, of, the, president, of, the, council, pierre, waldeck, rousseau, aided, by, zola, and, jaur, s, labori, was, convinced, to, give, up, his, argument, so, as, not, to, offend, the, military, they, decided, to, risk, conciliation, in, exchange, for, the, acquittal, that, seemed, to, be, promised, by, the, government, mr, demange, alone, and, without, illusions, continued, the, defence, of, dreyfus, in, an, atmosphere, of, civil, war, in, paris, the, antisemitic, and, nationalist, agitators, of, auteuil, were, arrested, jules, gu, rin, and, those, who, fled, and, holed, up, in, fort, chabrol, were, assaulted, by, the, police, on, 9, september, 1899, the, court, rendered, its, verdict, dreyfus, was, convicted, of, treason, but, with, extenuating, circumstances, by, five, votes, to, two, and, sentenced, to, ten, years, imprisonment, and, a, further, degradation, contrary, to, appearances, this, verdict, was, on, the, verge, of, acquittal, by, one, vote, the, code, of, military, justice, adopted, the, principle, that, a, minority, vote, of, three, against, four, was, an, acquittal, the, day, after, the, verdict, alfred, dreyfus, after, much, hesitation, filed, an, appeal, for, a, retrial, waldeck, rousseau, in, a, difficult, position, tackled, for, the, first, time, the, possibility, of, a, pardon, dreyfus, had, to, accept, guilt, exhausted, having, been, away, from, his, family, for, too, long, he, accepted, the, decree, was, signed, by, president, mile, loubet, on, 19, september, 1899, and, dreyfus, was, released, on, 21, september, 1899, many, dreyfusards, were, frustrated, by, this, final, act, public, opinion, welcomed, this, conclusion, indifferently, france, wanted, civil, peace, and, harmony, on, the, eve, of, the, universal, exhibition, of, 1900, and, before, the, big, fight, that, the, republic, was, about, to, take, for, freedom, of, association, and, secularism, it, was, in, this, spirit, that, on, 17, november, 1899, waldeck, rousseau, filed, an, amnesty, law, covering, all, criminal, acts, or, misdemeanours, related, to, the, dreyfus, affair, or, that, have, been, included, in, a, prosecution, for, one, of, these, acts, excluding, only, alfred, dreyfus, himself, who, was, instead, pardoned, to, be, able, to, still, seek, acquittal, many, dreyfusards, protested, as, this, indemnified, not, only, zola, and, picquart, against, further, punishment, but, also, protected, the, real, culprits, despite, these, massive, protests, the, bill, was, passed, reactions, in, france, were, strong, consisting, of, shock, and, sadness, in, the, revisionist, camp, still, other, reactions, tended, to, show, that, the, verdict, of, appeasement, made, by, the, judges, was, understood, and, accepted, by, the, population, the, republicans, sought, above, all, social, peace, and, to, turn, the, page, on, this, extremely, long, and, controversial, affair, also, there, were, very, few, demonstrations, in, the, provinces, while, agitation, persisted, somewhat, in, paris, in, the, military, world, appeasement, was, also, essential, two, of, the, seven, judges, voted, for, acquittal, they, refused, to, yield, to, the, implied, military, order, this, was, also, clearly, seen, in, an, apostrophe, for, the, army, galliffet, announced, the, incident, is, closed, anti, french, demonstrations, took, place, in, twenty, foreign, capitals, and, the, press, was, outraged, reactions, were, twofold, norwegian, composer, edvard, grieg, cancelled, his, concerts, in, france, in, protest, the, british, as, legalists, focused, on, espionage, and, challenged, rather, strongly, this, conviction, devoid, of, positive, arguments, in, its, construction, as, such, the, report, of, the, lord, chief, justice, of, england, lord, russell, of, killowen, on, 16, september, 1899, was, a, symbol, of, the, global, effect, of, the, affair, in, the, united, kingdom, russell, who, went, as, an, observer, to, rennes, criticised, the, weaknesses, of, the, military, court, the, military, judges, were, not, familiar, with, the, law, or, criminal, proceedings, they, lacked, the, experience, and, skill, that, can, see, the, evidence, behind, the, evidence, they, were, drowning, in, prejudice, and, they, acted, according, to, what, they, saw, as, the, honour, of, the, army, impressed, full, of, respect, for, their, superiors, they, accorded, too, much, importance, to, fragile, allegations, that, were, only, made, against, the, accused, thus, he, concluded, for, surely, it, might, have, been, predicted, with, certainty, that, if, the, revision, trial, had, taken, place, before, the, cour, de, cassation, dreyfus, would, now, be, a, free, man, in, germany, and, italy, the, two, countries, widely, challenged, by, lawsuits, against, dreyfus, there, was, relief, even, if, the, german, emperor, regretted, that, the, innocence, of, dreyfus, was, not, recognized, the, normalization, of, future, franco, german, relations, was, seen, as, a, welcome, relaxation, diplomacy, between, the, three, powers, with, the, help, of, england, sought, to, relax, in, an, atmosphere, that, deteriorated, again, on, the, eve, of, the, first, world, war, this, judicial, conclusion, also, had, an, unfortunate, consequence, for, the, relationship, between, the, dreyfus, family, and, the, branch, of, ultra, dreyfusards, fernand, labori, jaures, and, clemenceau, with, the, consent, of, picquart, openly, accused, alfred, dreyfus, of, accepting, the, pardon, and, only, gently, protesting, the, amnesty, law, preferring, to, avoid, a, third, trial, the, government, decided, to, pardon, dreyfus, by, a, decree, signed, by, president, mile, loubet, on, 19, september, 1899, after, much, hesitation, dreyfus, was, not, found, innocent, the, rehabilitation, process, was, not, completed, until, six, years, later, when, passions, had, cooled, many, books, appeared, during, this, period, in, addition, to, the, memoires, of, alfred, dreyfus, reinach, published, his, history, of, the, dreyfus, affair, and, jaur, s, published, the, proofs, as, for, zola, he, wrote, the, third, of, his, gospels, truth, even, esterhazy, took, advantage, of, his, secrets, and, sold, several, different, versions, of, the, text, of, his, statement, to, the, consul, of, france, on, 29, september, 1902, zola, who, was, the, initiator, of, the, affair, and, the, first, of, the, intellectual, dreyfusards, died, asphyxiated, by, fumes, from, his, chimney, his, wife, alexandrine, narrowly, escaped, it, was, a, shock, for, the, dreyfusard, clan, anatole, france, who, demanded, that, dreyfus, be, present, at, the, funeral, while, the, chief, of, police, wanted, his, absence, to, avoid, problems, read, his, funeral, oration, for, the, author, of, j, accuse, in, 1953, the, newspaper, lib, ration, published, a, death, bed, confession, by, a, parisian, roofer, that, he, had, murdered, zola, by, blocking, the, chimney, of, his, house, the, elections, of, 1902, saw, the, victory, of, the, left, jean, jaur, s, was, re, elected, and, he, revived, the, affair, on, 7, april, 1903, while, france, thought, the, affair, buried, forever, in, a, speech, jaur, s, evoked, the, long, list, of, falsehoods, peppering, the, dreyfus, case, and, placed, particular, emphasis, on, two, things, first, the, letter, of, resignation, from, pellieux, which, was, worded, in, very, harsh, terms, legally, it, formed, an, admission, of, the, collusion, of, the, general, staff, dupes, people, without, honour, can, no, longer, rely, on, the, trust, of, subordinates, without, which, command, is, impossible, for, my, side, i, can, not, trust, any, of, my, chiefs, who, have, been, working, on, falsehoods, i, ask, for, my, retirement, in, addition, the, note, allegedly, annotated, by, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, which, general, mercier, had, alluded, to, at, the, rennes, trial, which, is, reported, by, the, press, to, have, influenced, the, judges, of, the, military, court, given, these, developments, general, louis, andr, the, new, minister, of, war, led, an, investigation, at, the, instigation, of, mile, combes, and, assisted, by, judges, the, investigation, was, conducted, by, captain, antoine, louis, targe, aide, to, the, minister, during, searches, of, the, statistics, section, he, discovered, numerous, documents, most, of, which, were, obviously, fabricated, in, november, 1903, a, report, was, submitted, to, the, minister, of, justice, by, the, minister, of, war, this, was, in, compliance, with, the, regulations, since, the, minister, found, an, error, committed, by, the, military, court, this, was, the, beginning, of, a, new, review, led, by, lawyer, ludovic, trarieux, the, founder, of, the, league, of, human, rights, with, a, thorough, investigation, to, run, over, two, years, the, years, 1904, and, 1905, were, devoted, to, different, legal, phases, before, the, court, of, cassation, the, court, identified, three, events, grounds, for, review, the, demonstration, of, the, falsification, of, the, panizzardi, telegram, demonstration, of, a, date, change, on, a, document, in, the, 1894, trial, april, 1895, changed, to, april, 1894, and, demonstration, of, the, fact, that, dreyfus, had, not, removed, the, minutes, related, to, heavy, artillery, in, the, army, with, regard, to, the, writing, of, the, bordereau, the, court, was, particularly, severe, against, alphonse, bertillon, who, reasoned, badly, on, forged, documents, the, report, showed, that, the, writing, was, certainly, by, esterhazy, and, that, the, latter, had, also, confessed, subsequently, finally, the, court, demonstrated, by, a, comprehensive, and, skilled, analysis, of, the, bordereau, the, futility, of, this, purely, intellectual, construction, and, a, commission, of, four, headed, by, a, general, of, artillery, general, sebert, maintained, it, is, highly, unlikely, that, an, artillery, officer, could, write, this, missive, on, 9, march, 1905, attorney, general, baudouin, delivered, an, 800, page, report, in, which, he, demanded, the, convictions, be, quashed, without, further, reference, to, another, court, and, denounced, the, army, he, began, a, divestiture, of, the, military, justice, system, which, did, not, conclude, until, 1982, it, was, not, until, 12, july, 1906, that, the, court, of, cassation, unanimously, cancelled, the, judgment, without, reference, to, the, military, trial, at, rennes, in, 1899, and, pronounced, the, end, of, the, rehabilitation, of, captain, dreyfus, the, anti, dreyfusards, protested, at, this, hasty, rehabilitation, the, goal, was, obviously, political, it, was, to, finish, and, finally, turn, the, page, nothing, could, dent, the, conviction, of, the, opponents, of, dreyfus, this, method, was, the, most, direct, and, most, definitive, what, was, annulled, not, only, put, a, stop, to, rennes, but, the, entire, chain, of, prior, acts, beginning, with, the, arraignment, order, given, by, general, saussier, in, 1894, the, court, focused, on, the, legal, aspects, only, and, observed, that, dreyfus, did, not, have, a, duty, to, be, returned, before, a, military, court, for, the, simple, reason, that, it, should, never, have, taken, place, due, to, the, total, absence, of, charges, whereas, in, the, final, analysis, of, the, accusation, against, dreyfus, nothing, remains, standing, and, setting, aside, the, judgment, of, the, military, court, leaves, nothing, that, can, be, considered, to, be, a, crime, or, misdemeanour, therefore, by, applying, the, final, paragraph, of, article, 445, no, reference, to, another, court, should, be, pronounced, dreyfus, was, reinstated, in, the, army, with, the, rank, of, artillery, major, by, law, on, 13, july, 1906, this, reflected, the, rank, to, which, he, could, reasonably, have, been, expected, to, have, risen, had, his, career, not, been, interrupted, by, the, false, charges, against, him, however, dreyfus, and, his, supporters, were, disappointed, that, his, five, years, of, imprisonment, were, not, taken, into, account, for, the, reconstruction, of, his, career, and, that, his, promotion, to, major, was, back, dated, only, to, 10, july, 1903, this, decision, blocked, any, hope, of, a, career, worthy, of, his, past, successes, before, his, arrest, in, 1894, after, serving, for, a, year, as, commander, of, the, artillery, depot, at, fort, neuf, de, vincennes, major, dreyfus, retired, in, june, 1907, a, decision, taken, in, part, because, of, recurrent, tropical, fevers, and, chronic, fatigue, arising, from, the, strain, of, his, imprisonment, on, 4, june, 1908, on, the, occasion, of, the, transfer, of, the, ashes, of, mile, zola, to, the, pantheon, alfred, dreyfus, was, the, target, of, an, attack, louis, gr, gori, an, extreme, right, wing, journalist, and, assistant, of, drumont, fired, two, shots, from, a, revolver, and, wounded, dreyfus, slightly, in, the, arm, he, was, driven, to, do, this, for, action, fran, aise, french, action, not, only, to, disrupt, the, ceremony, for, the, two, traitors, zola, and, dreyfus, but, also, to, remake, the, dreyfus, trial, through, a, new, trial, a, revenge, of, some, sort, the, trial, was, at, the, assises, of, the, seine, where, gr, gori, was, acquitted, the, latest, in, a, long, series, of, judicial, misconducts, it, was, an, occasion, for, new, antisemitic, riots, that, the, government, suppressed, half, heartedly, as, a, reserve, officer, dreyfus, participated, in, the, first, world, war, of, 1914, 1918, serving, as, head, of, the, artillery, depot, at, a, fortified, camp, near, paris, and, commander, of, a, supply, column, in, 1917, he, saw, frontline, service, at, the, chemin, des, dames, and, verdun, apart, from, major, du, paty, de, clam, dreyfus, was, the, only, officer, directly, involved, in, the, affair, to, serve, in, the, war, having, been, named, as, a, chevalier, of, the, legion, of, honour, at, the, time, of, his, reinstatement, in, 1906, dreyfus, was, promoted, to, the, rank, of, officer, of, the, legion, of, honour, in, 1919, his, son, pierre, dreyfus, also, served, in, world, war, i, as, an, artillery, officer, and, was, awarded, the, croix, de, guerre,

as, a, tortured, society, all, sections, of, society, were, affected, some, were, devastated, according, to, katrin, schultheiss, a, modern, historian, the, enduring, significance, of, the, dreyfus, affair, lies, in, its, manifest, embodiment, of, multiple, narratives, and, multiple, strands, of, historical, causality, it, shows, how, longstanding, beliefs, and, tensions, can, be, transformed, into, a, juggernaut, that, alters, the, political, and, cultural, landscape, for, decades, in, the, interest, of, increasing, our, understanding, the, complexities, of, that, transformation, should, be, recognized, and, analyzed, rather, than, packaged, for, moral, or, political, usefulness, the, dreyfus, affair, brought, the, confrontation, between, two, sides, of, france, to, life, however, according, to, most, historians, this, opposition, served, the, republican, order, there, was, indeed, a, strengthening, of, parliamentary, democracy, and, a, failure, of, monarchist, and, reactionary, forces, the, excessive, violence, of, the, nationalist, parties, brought, together, republicans, in, a, united, front, which, defeated, attempts, to, return, to, the, old, order, in, the, short, term, progressive, political, forces, from, the, elections, of, 1893, and, confirmed, in, 1898, as, a, result, of, the, dreyfus, affair, disappeared, in, 1899, the, shock, trials, of, esterhazy, and, zola, created, a, dreyfusian, politics, whose, aim, was, to, develop, a, republican, consciousness, and, to, fight, against, authoritarian, nationalism, which, expressed, itself, during, the, affair, for, the, uninhibited, growth, of, populist, nationalism, was, another, major, result, of, the, event, in, french, politics, even, though, it, did, not, originate, from, the, dreyfus, affair, it, grew, out, of, the, boulanger, affair, 1886, 1889, and, was, shaped, into, a, coherent, theory, by, maurice, barr, s, in, 1892, nationalism, had, its, ups, and, downs, but, managed, to, maintain, itself, as, a, political, force, under, the, name, of, action, fran, aise, among, others, on, that, occasion, many, republicans, rallied, to, vichy, without, which, the, operation, of, the, state, would, have, been, precarious, which, showed, the, fragility, of, the, republican, institution, in, extreme, circumstances, upon, liberation, charles, maurras, who, was, convicted, on, 25, january, 1945, for, acts, of, collaboration, exclaimed, at, the, verdict, this, is, the, revenge, of, dreyfus, the, other, result, was, an, intellectual, mutation, of, socialism, jaur, s, was, a, late, dreyfusard, january, 1898, and, was, persuaded, by, revolutionary, socialists, his, commitment, became, unwavering, alongside, georges, clemenceau, and, from, 1899, under, the, influence, of, lucien, herr, the, year, 1902, saw, the, birth, of, two, parties, the, french, socialist, party, which, brought, together, jaur, siens, and, the, socialist, party, of, france, under, the, influence, of, guesde, and, vaillant, both, parties, merged, in, 1905, as, the, french, section, of, the, workers, international, sfio, in, addition, 1901, saw, the, birth, of, the, republican, radical, and, radical, socialist, party, the, first, modern, political, party, conceived, as, an, electoral, machine, of, the, republican, group, it, had, a, permanent, structure, and, relied, on, networks, of, dreyfusards, the, creation, of, the, french, league, for, human, rights, was, contemporaneous, with, the, affair, it, was, the, hub, of, the, intellectual, left, and, extremely, active, at, the, beginning, of, the, century, the, conscience, of, the, humanist, left, the, final, consequence, on, the, political, scene, at, the, turn, of, the, century, saw, a, profound, renewal, of, political, personalities, with, the, disappearance, of, great, republican, figures, beginning, with, auguste, scheurer, kestner, those, who, at, the, end, of, the, century, could, weigh, heavily, on, the, events, of, the, affair, had, now, disappeared, giving, way, to, new, men, whose, ambition, was, to, reform, and, correct, the, errors, and, injustices, of, the, past, the, dreyfus, affair, created, difficulties, and, blocked, the, way, for, improved, relations, between, france, and, italy, after, the, customs, war, as, italy, was, europe, s, most, dreyfusard, nation, socially, antisemitism, was, prominent, existing, prior, to, the, dreyfus, affair, it, had, expressed, itself, during, the, boulangisme, affair, and, the, panama, scandals, but, was, limited, to, an, intellectual, elite, the, dreyfus, affair, spread, hatred, of, jews, through, all, strata, of, society, a, movement, that, certainly, began, with, the, success, of, jewish, france, by, douard, drumont, in, 1886, it, was, then, greatly, amplified, by, various, legal, episodes, and, press, campaigns, for, nearly, fifteen, years, antisemitism, was, from, then, on, official, and, was, espoused, in, numerous, settings, including, the, working, classes, candidates, for, the, legislative, elections, took, advantage, of, antisemitism, as, a, watchword, in, parliamentary, elections, this, antisemitism, was, reinforced, by, the, crisis, of, the, separation, of, church, and, state, in, 1905, which, probably, led, to, its, height, in, france, antisemitic, actions, were, permitted, on, the, advent, of, the, vichy, regime, which, allowed, free, and, unrestrained, expression, of, racial, hatred, another, social, consequence, was, the, enhanced, role, of, the, press, for, the, first, time, it, exerted, an, important, influence, on, french, political, life, it, was, possible, to, speak, of, a, fourth, estate, since, it, could, act, the, part, of, all, state, organs, especially, as, the, high, editorial, quality, of, the, press, was, mainly, derived, from, the, work, of, writers, and, novelists, who, used, newspapers, as, a, revolutionary, way, of, expression, the, power, of, the, press, certainly, brought, politicians, to, action, an, example, of, which, was, mercier, who, appeared, to, have, pushed, at, the, dreyfus, trial, in, 1894, to, please, la, libre, parole, who, attacked, ferociously, this, being, said, the, role, of, the, press, was, limited, by, the, size, of, circulation, influential, in, paris, but, to, a, lesser, extent, nationwide, the, entire, run, of, the, national, press, appeared, to, revolve, around, four, and, a, half, million, copies, whose, real, influence, was, relatively, strong, there, was, also, assistance, through, the, publication, in, 1899, of, a, specific, newspaper, intended, to, coordinate, the, fight, in, the, dreyfusard, camp, with, the, people, s, daily, of, s, bastien, faure, the, shock, of, the, dreyfus, affair, also, affected, the, zionist, movement, which, found, fertile, ground, for, its, emergence, the, austro, hungarian, journalist, theodor, herzl, appeared, profoundly, moved, by, the, dreyfus, affair, which, followed, his, debut, as, a, correspondent, for, the, neue, freie, presse, of, vienna, and, was, present, at, the, degradation, of, dreyfus, in, 1895, the, catalyst, for, herzl, s, conversion, is, usually, seen, as, the, dreyfus, affair, which, made, him, realise, the, impossibility, of, jewish, existence, in, europe, although, some, scholars, believe, that, herzl, may, have, exaggerated, the, influence, that, the, dreyfus, affair, had, on, him, before, the, wave, of, antisemitism, that, accompanied, the, degradation, herzl, was, convinced, of, the, need, to, resolve, the, jewish, question, which, became, an, obsession, for, him, in, der, judenstaat, state, of, the, jews, he, considered, that, f, france, bastion, of, emancipation, progress, and, universal, socialism, get, caught, up, in, a, maelstrom, of, antisemitism, and, let, the, parisian, crowd, chant, kill, the, jews, where, can, they, be, safe, once, again, if, not, in, their, own, country, assimilation, does, not, solve, the, problem, because, the, gentile, world, will, not, allow, it, as, the, dreyfus, affair, has, so, clearly, demonstrated, herzl, s, shock, was, great, for, having, lived, his, youth, in, austria, an, antisemitic, country, he, chose, to, live, in, france, for, its, humanist, image, which, made, it, appear, a, shelter, from, extremist, excess, he, had, originally, been, a, fanatic, supporter, for, assimilation, of, jews, into, european, gentile, society, the, dreyfus, affair, shook, herzl, s, view, on, the, world, and, he, became, completely, enveloped, in, a, tiny, movement, calling, for, the, restoration, of, a, jewish, state, within, the, biblical, homeland, in, the, land, of, israel, herzl, quickly, took, charge, in, leading, the, movement, he, organized, on, 29, august, 1897, the, first, zionist, congress, in, basel, and, is, considered, the, inventor, of, zionism, as, a, real, political, movement, theodor, herzl, wrote, in, his, diary, 1, september, 1897, were, i, to, sum, up, the, basel, congress, in, a, word, which, i, shall, guard, against, pronouncing, publicly, it, would, be, this, at, basel, i, founded, the, jewish, state, if, i, said, this, out, loud, today, i, would, be, answered, by, universal, laughter, perhaps, in, five, years, and, certainly, in, fifty, everyone, will, recognize, this, the, dreyfus, affair, also, marked, a, turning, point, in, the, lives, of, many, jews, from, western, and, central, europe, as, the, pogroms, of, 1881, 1882, had, done, for, the, jews, of, eastern, europe, as, many, jews, had, believed, that, they, were, frenchmen, first, yet, jews, despite, the, state, sanctioned, efforts, of, the, emancipation, movement, were, never, truly, accepted, into, society, and, were, often, deemed, aliens, and, outsiders, even, when, they, showed, extreme, devotion, by, fighting, courageously, in, the, wars, of, their, respective, countries, in, october, 2021, french, president, emmanuel, macron, opened, a, museum, dedicated, to, the, dreyfus, affair, in, zola, s, former, home, in, m, dan, in, the, northwestern, suburbs, of, paris, he, said, that, nothing, could, repair, the, humiliations, and, injustices, dreyfus, had, suffered, and, let, us, not, aggravate, it, by, forgetting, deepening, or, repeating, them, the, reference, to, not, repeating, them, follows, attempts, by, the, french, far, right, to, question, dreyfus, s, innocence, an, army, colonel, was, cashiered, in, 1994, for, publishing, an, article, suggesting, that, dreyfus, was, guilty, far, right, politician, jean, marie, le, pen, s, lawyer, responded, that, dreyfus, s, exoneration, was, contrary, to, all, known, jurisprudence, ric, zemmour, a, far, right, political, opponent, of, macron, who, had, said, that, france, s, second, world, war, collaborationist, leader, philippe, p, tain, who, had, assisted, deportation, of, french, jews, to, nazi, death, camps, had, in, certain, cases, saved, their, lives, said, repeatedly, in, 2021, that, the, truth, about, dreyfus, was, not, clear, his, innocence, was, not, obvious, though, alfred, dreyfus, was, eventually, exonerated, of, all, charges, the, scandal, and, its, aftermath, had, lasting, repercussions, in, french, society, in, the, 21st, century, the, dreyfus, affair, remains, an, important, part, of, french, history, and, has, been, the, focus, of, much, public, debate, the, controversy, has, been, used, to, frame, discussion, on, issues, such, as, immigration, religious, freedom, minority, rights, and, the, french, republic, itself, in, recent, years, the, dreyfus, affair, has, also, been, used, to, draw, attention, to, the, resurgence, of, antisemitism, in, europe, and, to, advocate, for, legislation, that, would, protect, minority, rights, across, the, continent, in, recent, years, there, has, been, a, significant, push, to, create, legislation, to, protect, minority, rights, throughout, europe, with, the, dreyfus, affair, serving, as, an, important, reference, point, in, france, lawmakers, have, proposed, a, number, of, bills, that, would, extend, protections, to, minority, communities, such, as, prohibiting, discrimination, based, on, ethnicity, or, religion, and, providing, additional, resources, for, victims, of, hate, crimes, on, a, broader, european, level, the, european, union, has, implemented, a, variety, of, measures, such, as, a, hate, crime, reporting, system, and, a, program, of, positive, discrimination, to, ensure, that, minority, communities, are, not, disproportionately, affected, by, social, and, economic, policies, additionally, the, european, commission, has, set, up, a, coordinating, body, to, ensure, that, member, states, are, upholding, their, obligations, to, protect, minority, rights, in, 1985, president, fran, ois, mitterrand, commissioned, a, statue, of, dreyfus, by, sculptor, louis, mitelberg, it, was, to, be, installed, at, the, cole, militaire, but, the, minister, of, defense, charles, hernu, refused, to, display, it, there, hernu, claimed, that, this, was, because, the, cole, militaire, is, not, open, to, the, public, but, it, was, widely, believed, that, this, was, done, to, avoid, provoking, the, army, mitterrand, did, not, override, his, minister, and, the, statue, was, instead, installed, at, boulevard, raspail, no, 116, 118, at, the, exit, of, the, notre, dame, des, champs, metro, station, where, it, can, be, found, today, a, replica, is, located, at, the, entrance, of, paris, s, museum, of, jewish, art, and, history, which, houses, the, fond, dreyfus, of, over,
