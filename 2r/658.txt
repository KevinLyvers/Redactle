the, history, of, geology, is, concerned, with, the, development, of, the, natural, science, of, geology, geology, is, the, scientific, study, of, the, origin, history, and, structure, of, the, earth, in, the, year, 540, bc, xenophanes, described, fossil, fish, and, shells, found, in, deposits, on, mountains, similar, fossils, were, noted, by, herodotus, about, 490, bc, some, of, the, first, geological, thoughts, were, about, the, origin, of, the, earth, ancient, greece, developed, some, primary, geological, concepts, concerning, the, origin, of, the, earth, additionally, in, the, 4th, century, bc, aristotle, made, critical, observations, of, the, slow, rate, of, geological, change, he, observed, the, composition, of, the, land, and, formulated, a, theory, where, the, earth, changes, at, a, slow, rate, and, that, these, changes, cannot, be, observed, during, one, person, s, lifetime, aristotle, developed, one, of, the, first, evidence, based, concepts, connected, to, the, geological, realm, regarding, the, rate, at, which, the, earth, physically, changes, however, it, was, his, successor, at, the, lyceum, the, philosopher, theophrastus, who, made, the, greatest, progress, in, antiquity, in, his, work, on, stones, he, described, many, minerals, and, ores, both, from, local, mines, such, as, those, at, laurium, near, athens, and, further, afield, he, also, quite, naturally, discussed, types, of, marble, and, building, materials, like, limestones, and, attempted, a, primitive, classification, of, the, properties, of, minerals, by, their, properties, such, as, hardness, much, later, in, the, roman, period, pliny, the, elder, produced, a, very, extensive, discussion, of, many, more, minerals, and, metals, then, widely, used, for, practical, ends, he, was, among, the, first, to, correctly, identify, the, origin, of, amber, as, a, fossilized, resin, from, trees, by, the, observation, of, insects, trapped, within, some, pieces, he, also, laid, the, basis, of, crystallography, by, recognising, the, octahedral, habit, of, diamond, abu, al, rayhan, al, biruni, ad, 973, 1048, was, one, of, the, earliest, muslim, geologists, whose, works, included, the, earliest, writings, on, the, geology, of, india, hypothesizing, that, the, indian, subcontinent, was, once, a, sea, ibn, sina, avicenna, ad, 981, 1037, a, persian, polymath, made, significant, contributions, to, geology, and, the, natural, sciences, which, he, called, attabieyat, along, with, other, natural, philosophers, such, as, ikhwan, ai, safa, and, many, others, ibn, sina, wrote, an, encyclopedic, work, entitled, kitab, al, shifa, the, book, of, cure, healing, or, remedy, from, ignorance, in, which, part, 2, section, 5, contains, his, commentary, on, aristotle, s, mineralogy, and, meteorology, in, six, chapters, formation, of, mountains, the, advantages, of, mountains, in, the, formation, of, clouds, sources, of, water, origin, of, earthquakes, formation, of, minerals, the, diversity, of, the, earth, s, terrain, in, medieval, china, one, of, the, most, intriguing, naturalists, was, shen, kuo, 1031, 1095, a, polymath, personality, who, dabbled, in, many, fields, of, study, in, his, age, in, terms, of, geology, shen, kuo, is, one, of, the, first, naturalists, to, have, formulated, a, theory, of, geomorphology, this, was, based, on, his, observations, of, sedimentary, uplift, soil, erosion, deposition, of, silt, and, marine, fossils, found, in, the, taihang, mountains, located, hundreds, of, miles, from, the, pacific, ocean, he, also, formulated, a, theory, of, gradual, climate, change, after, his, observation, of, ancient, petrified, bamboos, found, in, a, preserved, state, underground, near, yanzhou, modern, yan, an, in, the, dry, northern, climate, of, shaanxi, province, he, formulated, a, hypothesis, for, the, process, of, land, formation, based, on, his, observation, of, fossil, shells, in, a, geological, stratum, in, a, mountain, hundreds, of, miles, from, the, ocean, he, inferred, that, the, land, was, formed, by, erosion, of, the, mountains, and, by, deposition, of, silt, it, was, not, until, the, 17th, century, that, geology, made, great, strides, in, its, development, at, this, time, geology, became, its, own, entity, in, the, world, of, natural, science, it, was, discovered, by, the, christian, world, that, different, translations, of, the, bible, contained, different, versions, of, the, biblical, text, the, one, entity, that, remained, consistent, through, all, of, the, interpretations, was, that, the, deluge, had, formed, the, world, s, geology, and, geography, to, prove, the, bible, s, authenticity, individuals, felt, the, need, to, demonstrate, with, scientific, evidence, that, the, great, flood, had, in, fact, occurred, with, this, enhanced, desire, for, data, came, an, increase, in, observations, of, the, earth, s, composition, which, in, turn, led, to, the, discovery, of, fossils, although, theories, that, resulted, from, the, heightened, interest, in, the, earth, s, composition, were, often, manipulated, to, support, the, concept, of, the, deluge, a, genuine, outcome, was, a, greater, interest, in, the, makeup, of, the, earth, due, to, the, strength, of, christian, beliefs, during, the, 17th, century, the, theory, of, the, origin, of, the, earth, that, was, most, widely, accepted, was, a, new, theory, of, the, earth, published, in, 1696, by, william, whiston, whiston, used, christian, reasoning, to, prove, that, the, great, flood, had, occurred, and, that, the, flood, had, formed, the, rock, strata, of, the, earth, during, the, 17th, century, both, religious, and, scientific, speculation, about, the, earth, s, origin, further, propelled, interest, in, the, earth, and, brought, about, more, systematic, identification, techniques, of, the, earth, s, strata, the, earth, s, strata, can, be, defined, as, horizontal, layers, of, rock, having, approximately, the, same, composition, throughout, an, important, pioneer, in, the, science, was, nicolas, steno, steno, was, trained, in, the, classical, texts, on, science, however, by, 1659, he, seriously, questioned, accepted, knowledge, of, the, natural, world, importantly, he, questioned, the, idea, that, fossils, grew, in, the, ground, as, well, as, common, explanations, of, rock, formation, his, investigations, and, his, subsequent, conclusions, on, these, topics, have, led, scholars, to, consider, him, one, of, the, founders, of, modern, stratigraphy, and, geology, steno, who, became, a, catholic, as, an, adult, was, eventually, made, a, bishop, and, was, beatified, in, 1988, by, pope, john, paul, ii, therefore, he, is, also, called, blessed, nicolas, steno, from, this, increased, interest, in, the, nature, of, the, earth, and, its, origin, came, a, heightened, attention, to, minerals, and, other, components, of, the, earth, s, crust, moreover, the, increasing, economic, importance, of, mining, in, europe, during, the, mid, to, late, 18th, century, made, the, possession, of, accurate, knowledge, about, ores, and, their, natural, distribution, vital, scholars, began, to, study, the, makeup, of, the, earth, in, a, systematic, manner, with, detailed, comparisons, and, descriptions, not, only, of, the, land, itself, but, of, the, semi, precious, metals, it, contained, which, had, great, commercial, value, for, example, in, 1774, abraham, gottlob, werner, published, the, book, von, den, usserlichen, kennzeichen, der, fossilien, on, the, external, features, of, fossils, which, brought, him, widespread, recognition, because, he, presented, a, detailed, system, for, identifying, specific, minerals, based, on, external, characteristics, the, more, efficiently, productive, land, for, mining, could, be, identified, and, the, semi, precious, metals, could, be, found, the, more, money, could, be, made, this, drive, for, economic, gain, propelled, geology, into, the, limelight, and, made, it, a, popular, subject, to, pursue, with, an, increased, number, of, people, studying, it, came, more, detailed, observations, and, more, information, about, the, earth, also, during, the, eighteenth, century, aspects, of, the, history, of, the, earth, namely, the, divergences, between, the, accepted, religious, concept, and, factual, evidence, once, again, became, a, popular, topic, for, discussion, in, society, in, 1749, the, french, naturalist, georges, louis, leclerc, comte, de, buffon, published, his, histoire, naturelle, in, which, he, attacked, the, popular, biblical, accounts, given, by, whiston, and, other, ecclesiastical, theorists, of, the, history, of, the, earth, from, experimentation, with, cooling, globes, he, found, that, the, age, of, the, earth, was, not, only, 4, 000, or, 5, 500, years, as, inferred, from, the, bible, but, rather, 75, 000, years, another, individual, who, described, the, history, of, the, earth, with, reference, to, neither, god, nor, the, bible, was, the, philosopher, immanuel, kant, who, published, his, universal, natural, history, and, theory, of, the, heavens, allgemeine, naturgeschichte, und, theorie, des, himmels, in, 1755, from, the, works, of, these, respected, men, as, well, as, others, it, became, acceptable, by, the, mid, eighteenth, century, to, question, the, age, of, the, earth, this, questioning, represented, a, turning, point, in, the, study, of, the, earth, it, was, now, possible, to, study, the, history, of, the, earth, from, a, scientific, perspective, without, religious, preconceptions, with, the, application, of, scientific, methods, to, the, investigation, of, the, earth, s, history, the, study, of, geology, could, become, a, distinct, field, of, science, to, begin, with, the, terminology, and, definition, of, what, constituted, geological, study, had, to, be, worked, out, the, term, geology, was, first, used, technically, in, publications, by, two, genevan, naturalists, jean, andr, deluc, and, horace, b, n, dict, de, saussure, though, geology, was, not, well, received, as, a, term, until, it, was, taken, up, in, the, very, influential, compendium, the, encyclop, die, published, beginning, in, 1751, by, denis, diderot, once, the, term, was, established, to, denote, the, study, of, the, earth, and, its, history, geology, slowly, became, more, generally, recognized, as, a, distinct, science, that, could, be, taught, as, a, field, of, study, at, educational, institutions, in, 1741, the, best, known, institution, in, the, field, of, natural, history, the, national, museum, of, natural, history, in, france, created, the, first, teaching, position, designated, specifically, for, geology, this, was, an, important, step, in, further, promoting, knowledge, of, geology, as, a, science, and, in, recognizing, the, value, of, widely, disseminating, such, knowledge, by, the, 1770s, chemistry, was, starting, to, play, a, pivotal, role, in, the, theoretical, foundation, of, geology, and, two, opposite, theories, with, committed, followers, emerged, these, contrasting, theories, offered, differing, explanations, of, how, the, rock, layers, of, the, earth, s, surface, had, formed, one, suggested, that, a, liquid, inundation, perhaps, like, the, biblical, deluge, had, created, all, geological, strata, the, theory, extended, chemical, theories, that, had, been, developing, since, the, seventeenth, century, and, was, promoted, by, scotland, s, john, walker, sweden, s, johan, gottschalk, wallerius, and, germany, s, abraham, werner, of, these, names, werner, s, views, become, internationally, influential, around, 1800, he, argued, that, the, earth, s, layers, including, basalt, and, granite, had, formed, as, a, precipitate, from, an, ocean, that, covered, the, entire, earth, werner, s, system, was, influential, and, those, who, accepted, his, theory, were, known, as, diluvianists, or, neptunists, the, neptunist, thesis, was, the, most, popular, during, the, late, eighteenth, century, especially, for, those, who, were, chemically, trained, however, another, thesis, slowly, gained, currency, from, the, 1780s, forward, instead, of, water, some, mid, eighteenth, century, naturalists, such, as, buffon, had, suggested, that, strata, had, been, formed, through, heat, or, fire, the, thesis, was, modified, and, expanded, by, the, scottish, naturalist, james, hutton, during, the, 1780s, he, argued, against, the, theory, of, neptunism, proposing, instead, the, theory, of, based, on, heat, those, who, followed, this, thesis, during, the, early, nineteenth, century, referred, to, this, view, as, plutonism, the, formation, of, the, earth, through, the, gradual, solidification, of, a, molten, mass, at, a, slow, rate, by, the, same, processes, that, had, occurred, throughout, history, and, continued, in, the, present, day, this, led, him, to, the, conclusion, that, the, earth, was, immeasurably, old, and, could, not, possibly, be, explained, within, the, limits, of, the, chronology, inferred, from, the, bible, plutonists, believed, that, volcanic, processes, were, the, chief, agent, in, rock, formation, not, water, from, a, great, flood, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, mining, industry, and, industrial, revolution, stimulated, the, rapid, development, of, the, stratigraphic, column, the, sequence, of, rock, formations, arranged, according, to, their, order, of, formation, in, time, in, england, the, mining, surveyor, william, smith, starting, in, the, 1790s, found, empirically, that, fossils, were, a, highly, effective, means, of, distinguishing, between, otherwise, similar, formations, of, the, landscape, as, he, travelled, the, country, working, on, the, canal, system, and, produced, the, first, geological, map, of, britain, at, about, the, same, time, the, french, comparative, anatomist, georges, cuvier, assisted, by, his, colleague, alexandre, brogniart, at, the, cole, des, mines, de, paris, realized, that, the, relative, ages, of, fossils, could, be, determined, from, a, geological, standpoint, in, terms, of, what, layer, of, rock, the, fossils, are, located, and, the, distance, these, layers, of, rock, are, from, the, surface, of, the, earth, through, the, synthesis, of, their, findings, brogniart, and, cuvier, realized, that, different, strata, could, be, identified, by, fossil, contents, and, thus, each, stratum, could, be, assigned, to, a, unique, position, in, a, sequence, after, the, publication, of, cuvier, and, brongniart, s, book, description, geologiques, des, environs, de, paris, in, 1811, which, outlined, the, concept, stratigraphy, became, very, popular, amongst, geologists, many, hoped, to, apply, this, concept, to, all, the, rocks, of, the, earth, during, this, century, various, geologists, further, refined, and, completed, the, stratigraphic, column, for, instance, in, 1833, while, adam, sedgwick, was, mapping, rocks, that, he, had, established, were, from, the, cambrian, period, charles, lyell, was, elsewhere, suggesting, a, subdivision, of, the, tertiary, period, whilst, roderick, murchison, mapping, into, wales, from, a, different, direction, was, assigning, the, upper, parts, of, sedgwick, s, cambrian, to, the, lower, parts, of, his, own, silurian, period, the, stratigraphic, column, was, significant, because, it, supplied, a, method, to, assign, a, relative, age, of, these, rocks, by, slotting, them, into, different, positions, in, their, stratigraphical, sequence, this, created, a, global, approach, to, dating, the, age, of, the, earth, and, allowed, for, further, correlations, to, be, drawn, from, similarities, found, in, the, makeup, of, the, earth, s, crust, in, various, countries, in, early, nineteenth, century, britain, catastrophism, was, adapted, with, the, aim, of, reconciling, geological, science, with, religious, traditions, of, the, biblical, great, flood, in, the, early, 1820s, english, geologists, including, william, buckland, and, adam, sedgwick, interpreted, diluvial, deposits, as, the, outcome, of, noah, s, flood, but, by, the, end, of, the, decade, they, revised, their, opinions, in, favour, of, local, inundations, charles, lyell, challenged, catastrophism, with, the, publication, in, 1830, of, the, first, volume, of, his, book, principles, of, geology, which, presented, a, variety, of, geological, evidence, from, england, france, italy, and, spain, to, prove, hutton, s, ideas, of, gradualism, correct, he, argued, that, most, geological, change, had, been, very, gradual, in, human, history, lyell, provided, evidence, for, uniformitarianism, a, geological, doctrine, holding, that, processes, occur, at, the, same, rates, in, the, present, as, they, did, in, the, past, and, account, for, all, of, the, earth, s, geological, features, lyell, s, works, were, popular, and, widely, read, and, the, concept, of, uniformitarianism, took, a, strong, hold, in, geological, society, in, 1831, captain, robert, fitzroy, given, charge, of, the, coastal, survey, expedition, of, hms, beagle, sought, a, suitable, naturalist, to, examine, the, land, and, give, geological, advice, this, fell, to, charles, darwin, who, had, just, completed, his, ba, degree, and, had, accompanied, sedgwick, on, a, two, week, welsh, mapping, expedition, after, taking, his, spring, course, on, geology, fitzroy, gave, darwin, lyell, s, principles, of, geology, and, darwin, became, an, advocate, of, lyell, s, ideas, inventively, theorising, on, uniformitarian, principles, about, the, geological, processes, he, saw, and, even, challenging, some, of, lyell, s, ideas, he, speculated, about, the, earth, expanding, to, explain, uplift, then, on, the, basis, of, the, idea, that, ocean, areas, sank, as, land, was, uplifted, theorised, that, coral, atolls, grew, from, fringing, coral, reefs, round, sinking, volcanic, islands, this, idea, was, confirmed, when, the, beagle, surveyed, the, cocos, keeling, islands, and, in, 1842, he, published, his, theory, on, the, structure, and, distribution, of, coral, reefs, darwin, s, discovery, of, giant, fossils, helped, to, establish, his, reputation, as, a, geologist, and, his, theorising, about, the, causes, of, their, extinction, led, to, his, theory, of, evolution, by, natural, selection, published, in, on, the, origin, of, species, in, 1859, economic, motivations, for, the, practical, use, of, geological, data, motivated, some, governments, to, support, geological, research, during, the, 19th, century, several, countries, including, canada, australia, great, britain, and, the, united, states, initiated, geological, surveying, that, would, produce, geological, maps, of, vast, areas, of, the, countries, geological, mapping, provides, the, location, of, useful, rocks, and, minerals, and, such, information, could, be, used, to, benefit, the, country, s, mining, and, quarrying, industries, with, the, government, and, industrial, funding, of, geological, research, more, individuals, undertook, study, of, geology, as, technology, and, techniques, improved, leading, to, the, expansion, of, the, field, of, the, science, in, the, 19th, century, geological, inquiry, had, estimated, the, age, of, the, earth, in, terms, of, millions, of, years, in, 1862, the, physicist, william, thomson, 1st, baron, kelvin, published, calculations, that, fixed, the, age, of, the, earth, at, between, 20, million, and, 400, million, years, he, assumed, that, the, earth, had, formed, as, a, completely, molten, object, and, estimated, the, amount, of, time, it, would, take, for, the, near, surface, to, cool, to, its, present, temperature, many, geologists, contended, that, thomson, s, estimates, were, inadequate, to, account, for, observed, thicknesses, of, sedimentary, rock, evolution, of, life, and, the, formation, of, the, crystalline, basement, rocks, beneath, the, sedimentary, cover, the, discovery, of, radioactivity, in, the, early, twentieth, century, provided, an, additional, source, of, heat, within, the, earth, allowing, for, an, increase, in, thomson, s, calculated, age, as, well, as, a, means, of, dating, geological, events, by, the, early, 20th, century, radiogenic, isotopes, had, been, discovered, and, radiometric, dating, had, been, developed, in, 1911, arthur, holmes, among, the, pioneers, in, the, use, of, radioactive, decay, as, a, means, of, measuring, geological, time, dated, a, sample, from, ceylon, at, 1, 6, billion, years, old, using, lead, isotopes, in, 1913, holmes, was, on, the, staff, of, imperial, college, when, he, published, his, famous, book, the, age, of, the, earth, in, which, he, argued, strongly, in, favour, of, the, use, of, radiometric, dating, methods, rather, than, methods, based, on, geological, sedimentation, or, cooling, of, the, earth, many, people, still, clung, to, lord, kelvin, s, calculations, of, less, than, 100, million, years, holmes, estimated, the, oldest, archean, rocks, to, be, 1, 600, million, years, old, but, did, not, speculate, about, the, earth, s, age, his, promotion, of, the, theory, over, the, next, decades, earned, him, the, nickname, of, father, of, modern, geochronology, in, 1921, attendees, at, the, yearly, meeting, of, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, came, to, a, rough, consensus, that, the, age, of, the, earth, was, a, few, billion, years, and, that, radiometric, dating, was, credible, holmes, published, the, age, of, the, earth, an, introduction, to, geological, ideas, in, 1927, in, which, he, presented, a, range, of, 1, 6, to, 3, 0, billion, years, increasing, the, estimate, in, the, 1940s, to, 4, 500, 100, million, years, based, on, measurements, of, the, relative, abundance, of, uranium, isotopes, established, by, alfred, o, c, nier, theories, that, did, not, comply, with, the, scientific, evidence, that, established, the, age, of, the, earth, could, no, longer, be, accepted, the, established, age, of, the, earth, has, been, refined, since, then, but, has, not, significantly, changed, in, 1912, alfred, wegener, proposed, the, theory, of, continental, drift, this, theory, suggests, that, the, shapes, of, continents, and, matching, coastline, geology, between, some, continents, indicates, they, were, joined, together, in, the, past, and, formed, a, single, landmass, known, as, pangaea, thereafter, they, separated, and, drifted, like, rafts, over, the, ocean, floor, currently, reaching, their, present, position, additionally, the, theory, of, continental, drift, offered, a, possible, explanation, as, to, the, formation, of, mountains, plate, tectonics, built, on, the, theory, of, continental, drift, unfortunately, wegener, provided, no, convincing, mechanism, for, this, drift, and, his, ideas, were, not, generally, accepted, during, his, lifetime, arthur, holmes, accepted, wegener, s, theory, and, provided, a, mechanism, mantle, convection, to, cause, the, continents, to, move, however, it, was, not, until, after, the, second, world, war, that, new, evidence, started, to, accumulate, that, supported, continental, drift, there, followed, a, period, of, 20, years, during, which, the, theory, of, continental, drift, developed, from, being, believed, by, a, few, to, being, the, cornerstone, of, modern, geology, beginning, in, 1947, research, provided, new, evidence, about, the, ocean, floor, and, in, 1960, bruce, c, heezen, published, the, concept, of, mid, ocean, ridges, soon, after, this, robert, s, dietz, and, harry, h, hess, proposed, that, the, oceanic, crust, forms, as, the, seafloor, spreads, apart, along, mid, ocean, ridges, in, seafloor, spreading, this, was, seen, as, confirmation, of, mantle, convection, and, so, the, major, stumbling, block, to, the, theory, was, removed, geophysical, evidence, suggested, lateral, motion, of, continents, and, that, oceanic, crust, is, younger, than, continental, crust, this, geophysical, evidence, also, spurred, the, hypothesis, of, paleomagnetism, the, record, of, the, orientation, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, recorded, in, magnetic, minerals, british, geophysicist, s, k, runcorn, suggested, the, concept, of, paleomagnetism, from, his, finding, that, the, continents, had, moved, relative, to, the, earth, s, magnetic, poles, tuzo, wilson, who, was, a, promoter, of, the, sea, floor, spreading, hypothesis, and, continental, drift, from, the, very, beginning, added, the, concept, of, transform, faults, to, the, model, completing, the, classes, of, fault, types, necessary, to, make, the, mobility, of, the, plates, on, the, globe, function, a, symposium, on, continental, drift, that, was, held, at, the, royal, society, of, london, in, 1965, must, be, regarded, as, the, official, start, of, the, acceptance, of, plate, tectonics, by, the, scientific, community, the, abstracts, from, the, symposium, are, issued, as, blacket, bullard, runcorn, 1965, in, this, symposium, edward, bullard, and, co, workers, showed, with, a, computer, calculation, how, the, continents, along, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, would, best, fit, to, close, the, ocean, which, became, known, as, the, famous, bullard, s, fit, by, the, late, 1960s, the, weight, of, the, evidence, available, saw, continental, drift, as, the, generally, accepted, theory, by, applying, sound, stratigraphic, principles, to, the, distribution, of, craters, on, the, moon, it, can, be, argued, that, almost, overnight, gene, shoemaker, took, the, study, of, the, moon, away, from, lunar, astronomers, and, gave, it, to, lunar, geologists, in, recent, years, geology, has, continued, its, tradition, as, the, study, of, the, character, and, origin, of, the, earth, its, surface, features, and, internal, structure, what, changed, in, the, later, 20th, century, is, the, perspective, of, geological, study, geology, was, now, studied, using, a, more, integrative, approach, considering, the, earth, in, a, broader, context, encompassing, the,
