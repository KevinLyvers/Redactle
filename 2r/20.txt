the, history, of, central, asia, concerns, the, history, of, the, various, peoples, that, have, inhabited, central, asia, the, lifestyle, of, such, people, has, been, determined, primarily, by, the, area, s, climate, and, geography, the, aridity, of, the, region, makes, agriculture, difficult, and, distance, from, the, sea, cut, it, off, from, much, trade, thus, few, major, cities, developed, in, the, region, nomadic, horse, peoples, of, the, steppe, dominated, the, area, for, millennia, relations, between, the, steppe, nomads, and, the, settled, people, in, and, around, central, asia, were, marked, by, conflict, the, nomadic, lifestyle, was, well, suited, to, warfare, and, the, steppe, horse, riders, became, some, of, the, most, militarily, potent, people, in, the, world, due, to, the, devastating, techniques, and, ability, of, their, horse, archers, periodically, tribal, leaders, or, changing, conditions, would, cause, several, tribes, to, organize, themselves, into, a, single, military, force, which, would, then, often, launch, campaigns, of, conquest, especially, into, more, civilized, areas, a, few, of, these, types, of, tribal, coalitions, included, the, huns, invasion, of, europe, various, turkic, migrations, into, transoxiana, and, most, notably, the, mongol, conquest, of, much, of, eurasia, the, dominance, of, the, nomads, ended, in, the, 16th, century, as, firearms, allowed, settled, people, to, gain, control, of, the, region, the, russian, empire, the, qing, dynasty, of, china, and, other, powers, expanded, into, the, area, and, seized, the, bulk, of, central, asia, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, after, the, russian, revolution, of, 1917, the, soviet, union, incorporated, most, of, central, asia, only, mongolia, and, afghanistan, remained, nominally, independent, although, mongolia, existed, as, a, soviet, satellite, state, and, soviet, troops, invaded, afghanistan, in, the, late, 20th, century, the, soviet, areas, of, central, asia, saw, much, industrialization, and, construction, of, infrastructure, but, also, the, suppression, of, local, cultures, and, a, lasting, legacy, of, ethnic, tensions, and, environmental, problems, with, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, five, central, asian, countries, gained, independence, kazakhstan, uzbekistan, turkmenistan, kyrgyzstan, and, tajikistan, in, all, of, the, new, states, former, communist, party, officials, retained, power, as, local, strongmen, with, the, partial, exception, of, kyrgyzstan, which, despite, ousting, three, post, soviet, presidents, in, popular, uprisings, has, as, yet, been, unable, to, consolidate, a, stable, democracy, homo, sapiens, reached, central, asia, by, 50, 000, to, 40, 000, years, ago, the, tibetan, plateau, is, thought, to, have, been, reached, by, 38, 000, years, ago, the, currently, oldest, modern, human, sample, found, in, northern, central, asia, is, a, 45, 000, year, old, remain, which, was, genetically, closest, to, ancient, and, modern, east, asians, but, his, lineage, died, out, quite, early, paleolithic, central, asia, was, characterized, by, an, distinctive, but, deeply, european, related, population, ancient, north, eurasian, with, subsequent, geneflow, from, paleo, siberians, contributing, east, asian, related, ancestry, towards, paleolithic, central, asians, during, the, bronze, age, ancient, central, asia, received, various, migration, events, from, europe, and, the, middle, east, associated, with, indo, europeans, bronze, age, central, asia, consisted, largely, of, iranian, peoples, with, some, groups, being, of, paleo, siberian, and, samoyedic, uralic, origin, since, the, early, iron, age, central, asia, received, noteworthy, amounts, of, migration, from, east, asian, related, populations, and, became, increasingly, diverse, the, turkic, peoples, slowly, replaced, and, assimilated, the, previous, iranian, speaking, locals, turning, the, population, of, central, asia, from, largely, iranian, into, primarily, of, east, asian, descent, modern, central, asians, are, characterized, by, both, west, eurasian, and, east, eurasian, ancestry, with, the, majority, being, of, primarily, east, asian, ancestry, and, can, be, linked, to, expanding, turkic, peoples, outgoing, from, mongolia, and, northeast, asia, the, term, ceramic, mesolithic, is, used, of, late, mesolithic, cultures, of, central, asia, during, the, 6th, to, 5th, millennia, bc, in, russian, archaeology, these, cultures, are, described, as, neolithic, even, though, farming, is, absent, it, is, characterized, by, its, distinctive, type, of, pottery, with, point, or, knob, base, and, flared, rims, manufactured, by, methods, not, used, by, the, neolithic, farmers, the, earliest, manifestation, of, this, type, of, pottery, may, be, in, the, region, around, lake, baikal, in, siberia, it, appears, in, the, elshan, or, yelshanka, or, samara, culture, on, the, volga, in, russia, by, about, 7000, bc, and, from, there, spread, via, the, dnieper, donets, culture, to, the, narva, culture, of, the, eastern, baltic, the, botai, culture, c, 3700, 3100, bc, is, suggested, to, be, the, earliest, culture, to, have, domesticated, the, horse, the, four, analyzed, botai, samples, had, about, 2, 3, european, related, and, 1, 3, east, asian, related, ancestry, the, botai, samples, also, showed, high, affinity, towards, the, mal, ta, boy, sample, in, siberia, in, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, chalcolithic, cultures, develop, in, the, second, half, of, the, 5th, millennium, bc, small, communities, in, permanent, settlements, which, began, to, engage, in, agricultural, practices, as, well, as, herding, around, this, time, some, of, these, communities, began, the, domestication, of, the, horse, according, to, the, kurgan, hypothesis, the, north, west, of, the, region, is, also, considered, to, be, the, source, of, the, root, of, the, indo, european, languages, the, horse, drawn, chariot, appears, in, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, by, 2000, bc, in, the, form, of, war, chariots, with, spoked, wheels, thus, being, made, more, maneuverable, and, dominated, the, battlefields, the, growing, use, of, the, horse, combined, with, the, failure, roughly, around, 2000, bc, of, the, always, precarious, irrigation, systems, that, had, allowed, for, extensive, agriculture, in, the, region, gave, rise, and, dominance, of, pastoral, nomadism, by, 1000, bc, a, way, of, life, that, would, dominate, the, region, for, the, next, several, millennia, giving, rise, to, the, scythian, expansion, of, the, iron, age, scattered, nomadic, groups, maintained, herds, of, sheep, goats, horses, and, camels, and, conducted, annual, migrations, to, find, new, pastures, a, practice, known, as, transhumance, the, people, lived, in, yurts, or, gers, tents, made, of, hides, and, wood, that, could, be, disassembled, and, transported, each, group, had, several, yurts, each, accommodating, about, five, people, while, the, semi, arid, plains, were, dominated, by, the, nomads, small, city, states, and, sedentary, agrarian, societies, arose, in, the, more, humid, areas, of, central, asia, the, bactria, margiana, archaeological, complex, of, the, early, 2nd, millennium, bc, was, the, first, sedentary, civilization, of, the, region, practicing, irrigation, farming, of, wheat, and, barley, and, possibly, a, form, of, writing, bactria, margiana, probably, interacted, with, the, contemporary, bronze, age, nomads, of, the, andronovo, culture, the, originators, of, the, spoke, wheeled, chariot, who, lived, to, their, north, in, western, siberia, russia, and, parts, of, kazakhstan, and, survived, as, a, culture, until, the, 1st, millennium, bc, these, cultures, particularly, bactria, margiana, have, been, posited, as, possible, representatives, of, the, hypothetical, aryan, culture, ancestral, to, the, speakers, of, the, indo, iranian, languages, see, indo, iranians, later, the, strongest, of, sogdian, city, states, of, the, fergana, valley, rose, to, prominence, after, the, 1st, century, bc, these, cities, became, home, to, the, traders, of, the, silk, road, and, grew, wealthy, from, this, trade, the, steppe, nomads, were, dependent, on, these, settled, people, for, a, wide, array, of, goods, that, were, impossible, for, transient, populations, to, produce, the, nomads, traded, for, these, when, they, could, but, because, they, generally, did, not, produce, goods, of, interest, to, sedentary, people, the, popular, alternative, was, to, carry, out, raids, a, wide, variety, of, people, came, to, populate, the, steppes, nomadic, groups, in, central, asia, included, the, huns, and, other, turks, as, well, as, indo, europeans, such, as, the, tocharians, persians, scythians, saka, yuezhi, wusun, and, others, and, a, number, of, mongol, groups, despite, these, ethnic, and, linguistic, differences, the, steppe, lifestyle, led, to, the, adoption, of, very, similar, culture, across, the, region, in, the, 2nd, and, 1st, millennia, bc, a, series, of, large, and, powerful, states, developed, on, the, southern, periphery, of, central, asia, the, ancient, near, east, these, empires, launched, several, attempts, to, conquer, the, steppe, people, but, met, with, only, mixed, success, the, median, empire, and, achaemenid, empire, both, ruled, parts, of, central, asia, the, xiongnu, empire, 209, bc, 93, 156, ad, may, be, seen, as, the, first, central, asian, empire, which, set, an, example, for, later, g, kt, rk, and, mongol, empires, xiongnu, s, ancestor, xianyu, tribe, founded, zhongshan, state, c, 6th, century, bc, c, 296, bc, in, hebei, province, china, the, title, chanyu, was, used, by, the, xiongnu, rulers, before, modun, chanyu, so, it, is, possible, that, statehood, history, of, the, xiongnu, began, long, before, modun, s, rule, following, the, success, of, the, han, xiongnu, war, chinese, states, would, also, regularly, strive, to, extend, their, power, westwards, despite, their, military, might, these, states, found, it, difficult, to, conquer, the, whole, region, when, faced, by, a, stronger, force, the, nomads, could, simply, retreat, deep, into, the, steppe, and, wait, for, the, invaders, to, leave, with, no, cities, and, little, wealth, other, than, the, herds, they, took, with, them, the, nomads, had, nothing, they, could, be, forced, to, defend, an, example, of, this, is, given, by, herodotus, s, detailed, account, of, the, futile, persian, campaigns, against, the, scythians, the, scythians, like, most, nomad, empires, had, permanent, settlements, of, various, sizes, representing, various, degrees, of, civilisation, the, vast, fortified, settlement, of, kamenka, on, the, dnieper, river, settled, since, the, end, of, the, 5th, century, bc, became, the, centre, of, the, scythian, kingdom, ruled, by, ateas, who, lost, his, life, in, a, battle, against, philip, ii, of, macedon, in, 339, bc, some, empires, such, as, the, persian, and, macedonian, empires, did, make, deep, inroads, into, central, asia, by, founding, cities, and, gaining, control, of, the, trading, centres, alexander, the, great, s, conquests, spread, hellenistic, civilisation, all, the, way, to, alexandria, eschate, lit, alexandria, the, furthest, established, in, 329, bc, in, modern, tajikistan, after, alexander, s, death, in, 323, bc, his, central, asian, territory, fell, to, the, seleucid, empire, during, the, wars, of, the, diadochi, in, 250, bc, the, central, asian, portion, of, the, empire, bactria, seceded, as, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, which, had, extensive, contacts, with, india, and, china, until, its, end, in, 125, bc, the, indo, greek, kingdom, mostly, based, in, the, punjab, region, but, controlling, a, fair, part, of, afghanistan, pioneered, the, development, of, greco, buddhism, the, kushan, kingdom, thrived, across, a, wide, swath, of, the, region, from, the, 2nd, century, bc, to, the, 4th, century, ad, and, continued, hellenistic, and, buddhist, traditions, these, states, prospered, from, their, position, on, the, silk, road, linking, china, and, europe, likewise, in, eastern, central, asia, the, chinese, han, dynasty, expanded, into, the, region, at, the, height, of, its, imperial, power, from, roughly, 115, to, 60, bc, han, forces, fought, the, xiongnu, over, control, of, the, oasis, city, states, in, the, tarim, basin, the, han, was, eventually, victorious, and, established, the, protectorate, of, the, western, regions, in, 60, bc, which, dealt, with, the, region, s, defence, and, foreign, affairs, chinese, rule, in, tarim, basin, was, replaced, successively, with, kushans, and, hephthalites, later, external, powers, such, as, the, sassanid, empire, would, come, to, dominate, this, trade, one, of, those, powers, the, parthian, empire, was, of, central, asian, origin, but, adopted, persian, greek, cultural, traditions, this, is, an, early, example, of, a, recurring, theme, of, central, asian, history, occasionally, nomads, of, central, asian, origin, would, conquer, the, kingdoms, and, empires, surrounding, the, region, but, quickly, merge, into, the, culture, of, the, conquered, peoples, at, this, time, central, asia, was, a, heterogeneous, region, with, a, mixture, of, cultures, and, religions, buddhism, remained, the, largest, religion, but, was, concentrated, in, the, east, around, persia, zoroastrianism, became, important, nestorian, christianity, entered, the, area, but, was, never, more, than, a, minority, faith, more, successful, was, manichaeism, which, became, the, third, largest, faith, turkic, expansion, began, in, the, 6th, century, the, turkic, speaking, uyghurs, were, one, of, many, distinct, cultural, groups, brought, together, by, the, trade, of, the, silk, route, at, turfan, which, was, then, ruled, by, china, s, tang, dynasty, the, uyghurs, primarily, pastoral, nomads, observed, a, number, of, religions, including, manichaeism, buddhism, and, nestorian, christianity, many, of, the, artefacts, from, this, period, were, found, in, the, 19th, century, in, this, remote, desert, region, it, was, during, the, sui, and, tang, dynasties, that, china, expanded, into, eastern, central, asia, chinese, foreign, policy, to, the, north, and, west, now, had, to, deal, with, turkic, nomads, who, were, becoming, the, most, dominant, ethnic, group, in, central, asia, to, handle, and, avoid, any, threats, posed, by, the, turks, the, sui, government, repaired, fortifications, and, received, their, trade, and, tribute, missions, they, sent, royal, princesses, off, to, marry, turkic, clan, leaders, a, total, of, four, of, them, in, 597, 599, 614, and, 617, the, sui, army, intervened, in, turks, civil, war, and, stirred, conflict, amongst, ethnic, groups, against, the, turks, as, early, as, the, sui, dynasty, the, turks, had, become, a, major, militarised, force, employed, by, the, chinese, when, the, khitans, began, raiding, northeast, china, in, 605, a, chinese, general, led, 20, 000, turks, against, them, distributing, khitan, livestock, and, women, to, the, turks, as, a, reward, on, two, occasions, between, 635, and, 636, tang, royal, princesses, were, married, to, turk, mercenaries, or, generals, in, chinese, service, throughout, the, tang, dynasty, until, the, end, of, 755, there, were, approximately, ten, turkic, generals, serving, under, the, tang, while, most, of, the, tang, army, was, made, of, fubing, chinese, conscripts, the, majority, of, the, troops, led, by, turkic, generals, were, of, non, chinese, origin, campaigning, largely, in, the, western, frontier, where, the, presence, of, fubing, troops, was, low, some, turkic, troops, were, nomadisized, han, chinese, a, desinicized, people, civil, war, in, china, was, almost, totally, diminished, by, 626, along, with, the, defeat, in, 628, of, the, ordos, chinese, warlord, liang, shidu, after, these, internal, conflicts, the, tang, began, an, offensive, against, the, turks, in, the, year, 630, tang, armies, captured, areas, of, the, ordos, desert, modern, day, inner, mongolia, province, and, southern, mongolia, from, the, turks, after, this, military, victory, emperor, taizong, won, the, title, of, great, khan, amongst, the, various, turks, in, the, region, who, pledged, their, allegiance, to, him, and, the, chinese, empire, with, several, thousand, turks, traveling, into, china, to, live, at, chang, an, on, june, 11, 631, emperor, taizong, also, sent, envoys, to, the, eastern, turkic, tribes, bearing, gold, and, silk, in, order, to, persuade, the, release, of, enslaved, chinese, prisoners, who, were, captured, during, the, transition, from, sui, to, tang, from, the, northern, frontier, this, embassy, succeeded, in, freeing, 80, 000, chinese, men, and, women, who, were, then, returned, to, china, while, the, turks, were, settled, in, the, ordos, region, former, territory, of, the, xiongnu, the, tang, government, took, on, the, military, policy, of, dominating, the, central, steppe, like, the, earlier, han, dynasty, the, tang, dynasty, along, with, turkic, allies, like, the, uyghurs, conquered, and, subdued, central, asia, during, the, 640s, and, 650s, during, emperor, taizong, s, reign, alone, large, campaigns, were, launched, against, not, only, the, g, kt, rks, but, also, separate, campaigns, against, the, tuyuhun, and, the, xueyantuo, taizong, also, launched, campaigns, against, the, oasis, states, of, the, tarim, basin, beginning, with, the, annexation, of, gaochang, in, 640, the, nearby, kingdom, of, karasahr, was, captured, by, the, tang, in, 644, and, the, kingdom, of, kucha, was, conquered, in, 649, the, expansion, into, central, asia, continued, under, taizong, s, successor, emperor, gaozong, who, invaded, the, western, turks, ruled, by, the, qaghan, ashina, helu, in, 657, with, an, army, led, by, su, dingfang, ashina, was, defeated, and, the, khaganate, was, absorbed, into, the, tang, empire, the, territory, was, administered, through, the, anxi, protectorate, and, the, four, garrisons, of, anxi, tang, hegemony, beyond, the, pamir, mountains, in, afghanistan, ended, with, revolts, by, the, turks, in, 665, but, the, tang, retained, a, military, presence, in, kyrgyzstan, tajikistan, uzbekistan, and, kazakhstan, these, holdings, were, later, invaded, by, the, tibetan, empire, to, the, south, in, 670, the, tang, empire, competed, with, the, tibetan, empire, for, control, of, areas, in, inner, and, central, asia, which, was, at, times, settled, with, marriage, alliances, such, as, the, marrying, of, princess, wencheng, d, 680, to, songts, n, gampo, d, 649, a, tibetan, tradition, mentions, that, after, songts, n, gampo, s, death, in, 649, ad, chinese, troops, captured, lhasa, the, tibetan, scholar, tsepon, w, d, shakabpa, believes, that, the, tradition, is, in, error, and, that, those, histories, reporting, the, arrival, of, chinese, troops, are, not, correct, and, claims, that, the, event, is, mentioned, neither, in, the, chinese, annals, nor, in, the, manuscripts, of, dunhuang, there, was, a, long, string, of, conflicts, with, tibet, over, territories, in, the, tarim, basin, between, 670, 692, and, in, 763, the, tibetans, even, captured, the, capital, of, china, chang, an, for, fifteen, days, during, the, an, shi, rebellion, in, fact, it, was, during, this, rebellion, that, the, tang, withdrew, its, western, garrisons, stationed, in, what, is, now, gansu, and, qinghai, which, the, tibetans, then, occupied, along, with, the, territory, of, central, asia, hostilities, between, the, tang, and, tibet, continued, until, they, signed, a, formal, peace, treaty, in, 821, the, terms, of, this, treaty, including, the, fixed, borders, between, the, two, countries, are, recorded, in, a, bilingual, inscription, on, a, stone, pillar, outside, the, jokhang, temple, in, lhasa, in, the, 8th, century, islam, began, to, penetrate, the, region, the, desert, nomads, of, arabia, could, militarily, match, the, nomads, of, the, steppe, and, the, umayyad, caliphate, gained, control, over, parts, of, central, asia, the, early, conquests, under, qutayba, ibn, muslim, 705, 715, were, soon, reversed, by, a, combination, of, native, uprisings, and, invasion, by, the, t, rgesh, but, the, collapse, of, the, t, rgesh, khaganate, after, 738, opened, the, way, for, the, re, imposition, of, muslim, authority, under, nasr, ibn, sayyar, the, arab, invasion, also, saw, chinese, influence, expelled, from, western, central, asia, at, the, battle, of, talas, in, 751, an, arab, army, decisively, defeated, a, tang, force, and, for, the, next, several, centuries, middle, eastern, influences, would, dominate, the, region, large, scale, islamization, however, did, not, begin, until, the, 9th, century, running, parallel, with, the, fragmentation, of, abbasid, political, authority, and, the, emergence, of, local, iranian, and, turkic, dynasties, like, the, samanids, over, time, as, new, technologies, were, introduced, the, nomadic, horsemen, grew, in, power, the, scythians, developed, the, saddle, and, by, the, time, of, the, alans, the, use, of, the, stirrup, had, begun, horses, continued, to, grow, larger, and, sturdier, so, that, chariots, were, no, longer, needed, as, the, horses, could, carry, men, with, ease, this, greatly, increased, the, mobility, of, the, nomads, it, also, freed, their, hands, allowing, them, to, use, the, bow, from, horseback, using, small, but, powerful, composite, bows, the, steppe, people, gradually, became, the, most, powerful, military, force, in, the, world, from, a, young, age, almost, the, entire, male, population, was, trained, in, riding, and, archery, both, of, which, were, necessary, skills, for, survival, on, the, steppe, by, adulthood, these, activities, were, second, nature, these, mounted, archers, were, more, mobile, than, any, other, force, at, the, time, being, able, to, travel, forty, miles, per, day, with, ease, the, steppe, peoples, quickly, came, to, dominate, central, asia, forcing, the, scattered, city, states, and, kingdoms, to, pay, them, tribute, or, face, annihilation, the, martial, ability, of, the, steppe, peoples, was, limited, however, by, the, lack, of, political, structure, within, the, tribes, confederations, of, various, groups, would, sometimes, form, under, a, ruler, known, as, a, khan, when, large, numbers, of, nomads, acted, in, unison, they, could, be, devastating, as, when, the, huns, arrived, in, western, europe, however, tradition, dictated, that, any, dominion, conquered, in, such, wars, should, be, divided, among, all, of, the, khan, s, sons, so, these, empires, often, declined, as, quickly, as, they, formed, once, the, foreign, powers, were, expelled, several, indigenous, empires, formed, in, central, asia, the, hephthalites, were, the, most, powerful, of, these, nomad, groups, in, the, 6th, and, 7th, century, and, controlled, much, of, the, region, in, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, the, region, was, divided, between, several, powerful, states, including, the, samanid, dynasty, that, of, the, seljuk, turks, and, the, khwarezmid, empire, the, most, spectacular, power, to, rise, out, of, central, asia, developed, when, genghis, khan, united, the, tribes, of, mongolia, using, superior, military, techniques, the, mongol, empire, spread, to, comprise, all, of, central, asia, and, china, as, well, as, large, parts, of, russia, and, the, middle, east, after, genghis, khan, died, in, 1227, most, of, central, asia, continued, to, be, dominated, by, the, mongol, successor, chagatai, khanate, this, state, proved, to, be, short, lived, as, in, 1369, timur, a, turco, mongol, ruler, conquered, most, of, the, region, even, harder, than, keeping, a, steppe, empire, together, was, governing, conquered, lands, outside, the, region, while, the, steppe, peoples, of, central, asia, found, conquest, of, these, areas, easy, they, found, governing, almost, impossible, the, diffuse, political, structure, of, the, steppe, confederacies, was, maladapted, to, the, complex, states, of, the, settled, peoples, moreover, the, armies, of, the, nomads, were, based, upon, large, numbers, of, horses, generally, three, or, four, for, each, warrior, maintaining, these, forces, required, large, stretches, of, grazing, land, not, present, outside, the, steppe, any, extended, time, away, from, the, homeland, would, thus, cause, the, steppe, armies, to, gradually, disintegrate, to, govern, settled, peoples, the, steppe, peoples, were, forced, to, rely, on, the, local, bureaucracy, a, factor, that, would, lead, to, the, rapid, assimilation, of, the, nomads, into, the, culture, of, those, they, had, conquered, another, important, limit, was, that, the, armies, for, the, most, part, were, unable, to, penetrate, the, forested, regions, to, the, north, thus, such, states, as, novgorod, and, muscovy, began, to, grow, in, power, in, the, 14th, century, much, of, central, asia, and, many, areas, beyond, it, were, conquered, by, timur, 1336, 1405, who, is, known, in, the, west, as, tamerlane, it, was, during, timur, s, reign, that, the, nomadic, steppe, culture, of, central, asia, fused, with, the, settled, culture, of, iran, one, of, its, consequences, was, an, entirely, new, visual, language, that, glorified, timur, and, subsequent, timurid, rulers, this, visual, language, was, also, used, to, articulate, their, commitment, to, islam, timur, s, large, empire, collapsed, soon, after, his, death, however, the, region, then, became, divided, among, a, series, of, smaller, khanates, including, the, khanate, of, khiva, the, khanate, of, bukhara, the, khanate, of, kokand, and, the, khanate, of, kashgar, the, lifestyle, that, had, existed, largely, unchanged, since, 500, bce, began, to, disappear, after, 1500, important, changes, to, the, world, economy, in, the, 14th, and, 15th, century, reflected, the, impact, of, the, development, of, nautical, technology, ocean, trade, routes, were, pioneered, by, the, europeans, who, had, been, cut, off, from, the, silk, road, by, the, muslim, states, that, controlled, its, western, termini, the, long, distance, trade, linking, east, asia, and, india, to, western, europe, increasingly, began, to, move, over, the, seas, and, not, through, central, asia, however, the, emergence, of, russia, as, a, world, power, enabled, central, asia, to, continue, its, role, as, a, conduit, for, overland, trade, of, other, sorts, now, linking, india, with, russia, on, a, north, south, axis, an, even, more, important, development, was, the, introduction, of, gunpowder, based, weapons, the, gunpowder, revolution, allowed, settled, peoples, to, defeat, the, steppe, horsemen, in, open, battle, for, the, first, time, construction, of, these, weapons, required, the, infrastructure, and, economies, of, large, societies, and, were, thus, impractical, for, nomadic, peoples, to, produce, the, domain, of, the, nomads, began, to, shrink, as, beginning, in, the, 15th, century, the, settled, powers, gradually, began, to, conquer, central, asia, the, last, steppe, empire, to, emerge, was, that, of, the, dzungars, who, conquered, much, of, east, turkestan, and, mongolia, however, in, a, sign, of, the, changed, times, they, proved, unable, to, match, the, chinese, and, were, decisively, defeated, by, the, forces, of, the, qing, dynasty, in, the, 18th, century, the, qing, emperors, themselves, originally, from, the, far, eastern, edge, of, the, steppe, campaigned, in, the, west, and, in, mongolia, with, the, qianlong, emperor, taking, control, of, xinjiang, in, 1758, the, mongol, threat, was, overcome, and, much, of, inner, mongolia, was, annexed, to, china, one, turko, mongolic, dynasty, that, remained, prominent, during, this, period, was, the, mughal, empire, whose, founder, babur, traced, descent, to, timur, while, the, mughals, were, never, able, to, conquer, babur, s, original, domains, in, fergana, valley, which, fell, to, the, shaybanids, they, maintained, influence, in, the, afghanistan, region, until, the, late, 17th, century, even, as, they, dominated, india, after, the, mughal, empire, s, decline, in, the, 18th, century, the, durrani, empire, from, afghanistan, would, briefly, overrun, the, north, western, region, of, india, by, the, 19th, century, the, rise, of, the, british, empire, would, limit, the, impact, of, afghan, conquerors, the, chinese, dominions, stretched, into, the, heart, of, central, asia, and, included, the, khanate, of, kokand, which, paid, tribute, to, beijing, outer, mongolia, and, xinjiang, did, not, become, provinces, of, the, chinese, empire, but, rather, were, directly, administered, by, the, qing, dynasty, the, fact, that, there, was, no, provincial, governor, meant, that, the, local, rulers, retained, most, of, their, powers, and, this, special, status, also, prevented, emigration, from, the, rest, of, china, into, the, region, persia, also, began, to, expand, north, especially, under, the, rule, of, nader, shah, who, extended, persian, dominion, well, past, the, oxus, after, his, death, however, the, persian, empire, rapidly, crumbled, the, russians, also, expanded, south, first, with, the, transformation, of, the, ukrainian, steppe, into, an, agricultural, heartland, and, subsequently, onto, the, fringe, of, the, kazakh, steppes, beginning, with, the, foundation, of, the, fortress, of, orenburg, the, slow, russian, conquest, of, the, heart, of, central, asia, began, in, the, early, 19th, century, although, peter, the, great, had, sent, a, failed, expedition, under, prince, bekovitch, cherkassky, against, khiva, as, early, as, the, 1720s, by, the, 1800s, the, locals, could, do, little, to, resist, the, russian, advance, although, the, kazakhs, of, the, great, horde, under, kenesary, kasimov, rose, in, rebellion, from, 1837, to, 1846, until, the, 1870s, for, the, most, part, russian, interference, was, minimal, leaving, native, ways, of, life, intact, and, local, government, structures, in, place, with, the, conquest, of, turkestan, after, 1865, and, the, consequent, securing, of, the, frontier, the, russians, gradually, expropriated, large, parts, of, the, steppe, and, gave, these, lands, to, russian, farmers, who, began, to, arrive, in, large, numbers, this, process, was, initially, limited, to, the, northern, fringes, of, the, steppe, and, it, was, only, in, the, 1890s, that, significant, numbers, of, russians, began, to, settle, farther, south, especially, in, zhetysu, semirechye, the, forces, of, the, khanates, were, poorly, equipped, and, could, do, little, to, resist, russia, s, advances, although, the, kokandian, commander, alimqul, led, a, quixotic, campaign, before, being, killed, outside, chimkent, the, main, opposition, to, russian, expansion, into, turkestan, came, from, the, british, who, felt, that, russia, was, growing, too, powerful, and, threatening, the, northwest, frontiers, of, british, india, this, rivalry, came, to, be, known, as, the, great, game, where, both, powers, competed, to, advance, their, own, interests, in, the, region, it, did, little, to, slow, the, pace, of, conquest, north, of, the, oxus, but, did, ensure, that, afghanistan, remained, independent, as, a, buffer, state, between, the, two, empires, after, the, fall, of, tashkent, to, general, cherniaev, in, 1865, khodjend, djizak, and, samarkand, fell, to, the, russians, in, quick, succession, over, the, next, three, years, as, the, khanate, of, kokand, and, the, emirate, of, bukhara, were, repeatedly, defeated, in, 1867, the, governor, generalship, of, russian, turkestan, was, established, under, general, konstantin, petrovich, von, kaufmann, with, its, headquarters, at, tashkent, in, 1881, 1885, the, transcaspian, region, was, annexed, in, the, course, of, a, campaign, led, by, generals, mikhail, annenkov, and, mikhail, skobelev, and, ashgabat, from, persia, merv, and, panjdeh, from, afghanistan, all, came, under, russian, control, russian, expansion, was, halted, in, 1887, when, russia, and, great, britain, delineated, the, northern, border, of, afghanistan, bukhara, and, the, khanate, of, khiva, remained, quasi, independent, but, were, essentially, protectorates, along, the, lines, of, the, princely, states, of, british, india, although, the, conquest, was, prompted, by, almost, purely, military, concerns, in, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, turkestan, came, to, play, a, reasonably, important, economic, role, within, the, russian, empire, because, of, the, american, civil, war, cotton, shot, up, in, price, in, the, 1860s, becoming, an, increasingly, important, commodity, in, the, region, although, its, cultivation, was, on, a, much, lesser, scale, than, during, the, soviet, period, the, cotton, trade, led, to, improvements, the, trans, caspian, railway, from, krasnovodsk, to, samarkand, and, tashkent, and, the, trans, aral, railway, from, orenburg, to, tashkent, were, constructed, in, the, long, term, the, development, of, a, cotton, monoculture, would, render, turkestan, dependent, on, food, imports, from, western, siberia, and, the, turkestan, siberia, railway, was, already, planned, when, the, first, world, war, broke, out, russian, rule, still, remained, distant, from, the, local, populace, mostly, concerning, itself, with, the, small, minority, of, russian, inhabitants, of, the, region, the, local, muslims, were, not, considered, full, russian, citizens, they, did, not, have, the, full, privileges, of, russians, but, nor, did, they, have, the, same, obligations, such, as, military, service, the, tsarist, regime, left, substantial, elements, of, the, previous, regimes, such, as, muslim, religious, courts, intact, and, local, self, government, at, the, village, level, was, quite, extensive, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, the, qing, dynasty, made, several, campaigns, to, conquer, the, dzungar, mongols, in, the, meantime, they, incorporated, parts, of, central, asia, into, the, chinese, empire, internal, turmoil, largely, halted, chinese, expansion, in, the, 19th, century, in, 1867, yakub, beg, led, a, rebellion, that, saw, kashgar, declaring, its, independence, as, the, taiping, and, nian, rebellions, in, the, heartland, of, the, empire, prevented, the, chinese, from, reasserting, their, control, instead, the, russians, expanded, annexing, the, chu, and, ili, valleys, and, the, city, of, kuldja, from, the, chinese, empire, after, yakub, beg, s, death, at, korla, in, 1877, his, state, collapsed, as, the, area, was, reconquered, by, china, after, lengthy, negotiations, kuldja, was, returned, to, beijing, by, russia, in, 1884, during, the, first, world, war, the, muslim, exemption, from, conscription, was, removed, by, the, russians, sparking, the, central, asian, revolt, of, 1916, when, the, russian, revolution, of, 1917, occurred, a, provisional, government, of, jadid, reformers, also, known, as, the, turkestan, muslim, council, met, in, kokand, and, declared, turkestan, s, autonomy, this, new, government, was, quickly, crushed, by, the, forces, of, the, tashkent, soviet, and, the, semi, autonomous, states, of, bukhara, and, khiva, were, also, invaded, the, main, independence, forces, were, rapidly, crushed, but, guerrillas, known, as, basmachi, continued, to, fight, the, communists, until, 1924, mongolia, was, also, swept, up, by, the, russian, revolution, and, though, it, never, became, a, soviet, republic, it, became, a, communist, people, s, republic, in, 1924, the, creation, of, the, republic, of, china, in, 1911, and, the, general, turmoil, in, china, affected, the, qing, dynasty, s, holdings, in, central, asia, republic, of, china, s, control, of, the, region, was, relegated, to, southern, xinjiang, and, there, was, a, dual, threat, from, islamic, separatists, and, communists, eventually, the, region, became, largely, independent, under, the, control, of, the, provincial, governor, rather, than, invade, the, soviet, union, established, a, network, of, consulates, in, the, region, and, sent, aid, and, technical, advisors, by, the, 1930s, the, governor, of, xinjiang, s, relationship, with, moscow, was, far, more, important, than, that, with, nanking, the, chinese, civil, war, further, destabilised, the, region, and, saw, turkic, nationalists, make, attempts, at, independence, in, 1933, the, first, east, turkestan, republic, was, declared, but, it, was, destroyed, soon, after, with, the, aid, of, the, soviet, troops, after, the, german, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1941, governor, sheng, shicai, of, xinjiang, gambled, and, broke, his, links, to, moscow, moving, to, ally, himself, with, the, kuomintang, this, led, to, a, civil, war, within, the, region, sheng, was, eventually, forced, to, flee, and, the, soviet, backed, second, east, turkestan, republic, was, formed, in, northern, dzungaria, while, the, republic, of, china, retained, control, of, southern, xinjiang, both, states, were, annexed, by, the, people, s, republic, of, china, in, 1949, after, being, conquered, by, bolshevik, forces, soviet, central, asia, experienced, a, flurry, of, administrative, reorganisation, in, 1918, the, bolsheviks, set, up, the, turkestan, autonomous, soviet, socialist, republic, and, bukhara, and, khiva, also, became, ssrs, in, 1919, the, conciliatory, commission, for, turkestan, affairs, was, established, to, try, to, improve, relations, between, the, locals, and, the, communists, new, policies, were, introduced, respecting, local, customs, and, religion, in, 1920, the, kirghiz, autonomous, soviet, socialist, republic, covering, modern, kazakhstan, was, set, up, it, was, renamed, the, kazakh, autonomous, soviet, socialist, republic, in, 1925, in, 1924, the, soviets, created, the, uzbek, ssr, and, the, turkmen, ssr, in, 1929, the, tajik, ssr, was, split, from, the, uzbek, ssr, the, kyrgyz, autonomous, oblast, became, an, ssr, in, 1936, these, borders, had, little, to, do, with, ethnic, make, up, but, the, soviets, felt, it, important, to, divide, the, region, they, saw, both, pan, turkism, and, pan, islamism, as, threats, which, dividing, turkestan, would, limit, under, the, soviets, the, local, languages, and, cultures, were, systematised, and, codified, and, their, differences, clearly, demarcated, and, encouraged, new, cyrillic, writing, systems, were, introduced, to, break, links, with, turkey, and, iran, under, the, soviets, the, southern, border, was, almost, completely, closed, and, all, travel, and, trade, was, directed, north, through, russia, during, the, period, of, forced, collectivisation, under, joseph, stalin, at, least, a, million, persons, died, mostly, in, the, kazakh, ssr, islam, as, well, as, other, religions, were, also, attacked, in, the, second, world, war, several, million, refugees, and, hundreds, of, factories, were, moved, to, the, relative, security, of, central, asia, and, the, region, permanently, became, an, important, part, of, the, soviet, industrial, complex, several, important, military, facilities, were, also, located, in, the, region, including, nuclear, testing, facilities, and, the, baikonur, cosmodrome, the, virgin, lands, campaign, starting, in, 1954, was, a, massive, soviet, agricultural, resettlement, program, that, brought, more, than, 300, 000, individuals, mostly, from, the, ukraine, to, the, northern, kazakh, ssr, and, the, altai, region, of, the, russian, sfsr, this, was, a, major, change, in, the, ethnicity, of, the, region, similar, processes, occurred, in, xinjiang, and, the, rest, of, western, china, where, the, people, s, republic, of, china, quickly, established, control, from, the, second, east, turkestan, republic, that, controlled, northern, xinjiang, and, the, republic, of, china, forces, that, controlled, southern, xinjiang, after, the, qing, dynasty, the, area, was, subject, to, a, number, of, development, schemes, and, like, soviet, central, asia, one, focus, was, on, the, growing, of, the, cotton, cash, crop, these, efforts, were, overseen, by, the, xinjiang, production, and, construction, corps, the, xpcc, also, encouraged, han, chinese, to, return, to, xinjiang, after, many, had, migrated, out, during, the, muslim, revolts, against, the, qing, dynasty, political, turmoil, has, led, to, major, demographic, shifts, in, the, region, during, the, qing, dynasty, there, were, 60, turkic, and, 30, han, chinese, in, the, region, after, the, muslim, revolts, the, percentage, of, han, chinese, dropped, to, as, low, as, 7, and, by, the, year, 2000, some, 40, of, the, population, of, xinjiang, were, han, as, with, the, soviet, union, local, languages, and, cultures, were, mostly, encouraged, and, xinjiang, was, granted, autonomous, status, however, islam, was, much, persecuted, especially, during, the, cultural, revolution, many, people, from, other, parts, of, china, fled, to, xinjiang, due, to, the, failed, agricultural, policies, of, the, great, leap, forward, in, other, provinces, however, the, great, leap, forward, did, not, affect, much, of, xinjiang, due, to, its, geographical, isolation, from, other, parts, of, china, the, second, world, war, sparked, the, widespread, migration, of, soviet, citizens, to, the, rear, of, the, ussr, much, of, this, movement, was, directed, to, soviet, central, asia, these, migrations, included, official, state, organised, evacuations, and, deportations, as, well, as, the, non, sanctioned, panicked, flight, from, the, front, by, both, general, citizenry, and, important, officials, the, evacuation, of, soviet, citizens, and, industry, during, world, war, ii, was, an, essential, element, of, their, overall, success, in, the, war, and, central, asia, served, as, a, main, destination, for, evacuees, the, german, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, began, on, june, 22, 1941, a, decree, from, the, presidium, of, the, executive, committee, on, the, same, day, forbade, the, entry, or, exit, from, the, ussr, s, border, regions, which, were, under, a, state, of, martial, law, such, mandates, demonstrated, the, soviets, fear, of, spreading, panic, and, their, commitment, to, asserting, direct, state, control, over, wartime, relocations, to, maintain, order, soviet, wartime, population, policy, consisted, of, two, distinct, operations, deportation, and, evacuation, deportation, aimed, to, clear, regions, near, the, front, of, potentially, insidious, anti, soviet, elements, that, could, hamper, the, war, effort, while, evacuation, policy, aimed, to, move, soviet, industry, and, intelligentsia, to, the, rear, where, they, would, be, safe, soviet, officials, organised, their, wartime, deportation, policy, largely, along, ethnic, lines, as, a, response, to, the, german, invasion, soviet, citizens, of, german, descent, in, border, regions, were, targeted, for, deportation, to, the, rear, where, soviet, authorities, had, no, need, to, worry, of, their, conspiring, with, the, enemy, such, dubious, ethnically, derived, logic, was, not, reserved, for, germans, many, finns, were, also, forcibly, relocated, in, the, first, year, of, the, war, simply, for, their, heritage, though, they, were, mainly, sent, to, remote, areas, in, the, northern, rear, such, as, siberia, rather, than, central, asia, a, large, portion, of, the, german, deportees, however, were, sent, to, kazakhstan, the, remobilisation, of, relocated, human, resources, into, the, labour, force, was, pivotal, to, soviet, wartime, production, policy, and, to, that, end, many, able, bodied, deportees, were, conscripted, into, a, labour, army, with, military, style, discipline, by, early, 1942, as, many, as, 20, 800, ethnic, germans, had, been, organised, into, battalions, in, this, labour, army, though, this, number, would, grow, to, as, much, as, 222, 000, by, early, 1944, as, conscription, criteria, were, broadened, the, nkvd, employed, about, 101, 000, members, of, the, labour, army, at, construction, sites, to, develop, infrastructure, for, the, war, effort, those, who, were, not, assigned, to, the, labour, army, were, used, for, timber, harvesting, the, construction, of, railways, and, other, infrastructure, or, sent, to, collective, farms, as, the, tide, turned, in, the, war, and, the, soviets, began, to, reclaim, the, territories, they, lost, to, the, initial, german, advance, they, began, a, new, wave, of, deportations, of, unfavoured, ethnic, groups, karachais, kalmyks, chechens, ingushetians, kabardians, and, crimean, tatars, were, all, deported, to, central, asia, for, their, supposed, fraternisation, with, occupying, german, forces, these, groups, were, sent, mostly, to, kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan, and, uzbekistan, for, their, infidelity, these, punitive, deportations, were, also, conducted, to, keep, anti, soviet, elements, far, from, the, border, where, the, soviet, offensive, against, germany, was, progressing, for, fear, of, spying, or, sabotage, many, soviet, citizens, ended, up, in, central, asia, during, world, war, ii, not, as, a, result, of, deportation, but, evacuation, the, evacuation, focused, on, the, movement, of, critical, wartime, industry, and, the, factory, workers, responsible, for, overseeing, such, production, whole, factories, and, their, employees, were, moved, together, via, railway, eastward, to, cities, like, tashkent, which, received, a, lion, s, share, of, the, evacuees, the, initial, attempts, at, evacuation, while, the, war, was, still, in, its, early, stages, through, early, 1942, were, a, far, cry, from, the, organised, affair, that, the, soviet, central, bureaucracy, envisaged, throughout, the, summer, and, fall, of, 1941, numerous, soviet, frontier, cities, evacuated, in, a, haphazard, and, panicked, fashion, before, the, german, onslaught, a, number, of, factors, led, to, this, lack, of, organisation, for, one, the, soviet, evacuation, plans, were, thrown, together, fairly, hurriedly, and, a, lot, of, the, logistical, planning, was, done, on, the, fly, as, the, german, advance, was, already, sweeping, through, the, soviet, border, zone, the, german, invasion, also, hampered, the, effectiveness, of, the, soviet, response, by, shattering, their, communications, in, the, war, s, early, stages, many, soviet, leaders, were, unable, to, gather, reliable, information, about, the, positions, of, german, forces, until, it, was, too, late, to, effect, an, orderly, evacuation, there, was, also, a, desire, on, the, part, of, soviet, officials, to, forestall, any, evacuations, until, it, was, absolutely, necessary, the, marching, orders, were, often, to, continue, factory, production, until, the, eve, of, occupation, before, hurriedly, dismantling, and, transporting, factory, equipment, and, destroying, what, couldn, t, be, moved, in, time, as, a, result, of, the, delay, in, evacuations, they, were, often, carried, out, under, german, aerial, bombardment, which, led, to, additional, confusion, among, the, frightened, citizenry, historian, rebecca, manley, describes, these, early, evacuations, as, being, charactered, by, three, phenomena, the, flight, of, officials, the, flight, of, the, population, and, panic, the, early, flight, of, soviet, officials, who, were, supposed, to, manage, the, evacuation, was, roundly, condemned, by, soviet, leaders, but, often, their, retreat, resulted, from, a, realisation, that, evacuation, procedures, had, started, too, late, and, that, there, was, no, way, to, effectively, execute, it, additionally, soviet, officials, who, remained, in, a, city, captured, by, german, forces, feared, execution, by, nazis, on, the, hunt, for, communists, avoiding, that, the, officials, knew, that, they, would, be, subject, to, intense, interrogation, as, to, what, happened, by, suspicious, soviets, upon, returning, to, the, fold, despite, these, setbacks, in, the, implementation, of, evacuation, policy, early, in, the, war, around, 12, million, soviet, citizens, successfully, evacuated, in, 1941, even, if, a, number, of, these, were, the, result, of, disorganised, spontaneous, self, evacuation, and, another, 4, 5, million, evacuated, the, following, year, in, addition, the, factories, that, were, successfully, evacuated, to, the, central, asian, rear, would, help, provide, the, productive, capacity, the, soviets, needed, to, eventually, win, the, war, as, well, as, preventing, the, germans, from, acquiring, additional, industrial, resources, by, providing, a, safe, haven, from, the, german, advance, for, soviet, citizens, central, asia, played, a, critical, role, in, securing, allied, victory, the, evacuation, itself, was, only, part, of, the, difficulty, however, as, evacuees, arriving, in, central, asia, faced, many, trials, and, tribulations, due, to, the, haphazard, nature, of, evacuation, many, labourers, did, not, arrive, with, their, factory, and, had, to, find, labour, on, their, own, though, jobs, were, hard, to, come, by, additionally, cities, like, tashkent, became, overwhelmed, at, the, sheer, volume, of, people, arriving, at, its, gates, and, had, great, difficulty, supplying, the, food, and, shelter, necessary, for, evacuees, upon, arrival, many, evacuees, died, of, illness, or, starvation, in, extreme, poverty, in, central, asia, uzbek, officials, set, up, aid, stations, at, tashkent, which, were, mirrored, at, other, railway, stations, to, help, combat, the, poverty, but, they, could, only, do, so, much, as, little, could, be, spared, economically, for, the, war, effort, despite, these, troubles, the, ability, of, central, asia, to, absorb, soviet, industry, and, population, to, the, extent, that, it, did, and, in, the, harried, manner, that, it, did, was, impressive, the, germans, certainly, didn, t, foresee, the, preparedness, of, soviet, central, asia, and, in, the, end, they, paid, dearly, for, it, from, 1988, to, 1992, a, free, press, and, multi, party, system, developed, in, the, central, asian, republics, as, perestroika, pressured, the, local, communist, parties, to, open, up, what, svat, soucek, calls, the, central, asian, spring, was, very, short, lived, as, soon, after, independence, former, communist, party, officials, recast, themselves, as, local, strongmen, political, stability, in, the, region, has, mostly, been, maintained, with, the, major, exception, of, the, tajik, civil, war, that, lasted, from, 1992, to, 1997, 2005, also, saw, the, largely, peaceful, ousting, of, kyrgyz, president, askar, akayev, in, the, tulip, revolution, and, an, outbreak, of, violence, in, andijan, uzbekistan, much, of, the, population, of, soviet, central, asia, was, indifferent, to, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, even, the, large, russian, populations, in, kazakhstan, roughly, 40, of, the, total, and, tashkent, uzbekistan, aid, from, the, kremlin, had, also, been, central, to, the, economies, of, central, asia, each, of, the, republics, receiving, massive, transfers, of, funds, from, moscow, independence, largely, resulted, from, the, efforts, of, the, small, groups, of, nationalistic, mostly, local, intellectuals, and, from, little, interest, in, moscow, for, retaining, the, expensive, region, while, never, a, part, of, the, soviet, union, mongolia, followed, a, somewhat, similar, path, often, acting, as, the, unofficial, sixteenth, soviet, republic, it, shed, the, communist, system, only, in, 1996, but, quickly, ran, into, economic, problems, the, economic, performance, of, the, region, since, independence, has, been, mixed, it, contains, some, of, the, largest, reserves, of, natural, resources, in, the, world, but, there, are, important, difficulties, in, transporting, them, since, it, lies, farther, from, the, ocean, than, anywhere, else, in, the, world, and, its, southern, borders, lay, closed, for, decades, the, main, trade, routes, and, pipelines, run, through, russia, as, a, result, russia, still, exerts, more, influence, over, the, region, than, in, any, other, former, soviet, republics, nevertheless, the, rising, energy, importance, of, the, caspian, sea, entails, a, great, involvement, in, the, region, by, the, us, the, former, soviet, republics, of, the, caucasus, now, have, their, own, us, special, envoy, and, inter, agency, working, groups, former, us, secretary, of, energy, bill, richardson, had, claimed, that, the, caspian, region, will, hopefully, save, us, from, total, dependence, on, middle, east, oil, some, analysts, such, as, myers, jaffe, and, robert, a, manning, estimate, however, that, us, entry, into, the, region, with, initiatives, such, as, the, us, favored, baku, tbilisi, ceyhan, pipeline, as, a, major, actor, may, complicate, moscow, s, chances, of, making, a, decisive, break, with, its, past, economic, mistakes, and, geopolitical, excesses, in, central, asia, they, also, regard, as, a, myth, the, assertion, that, caspian, oil, and, gas, will, be, a, cheaper, and, more, secure, alternative, to, supplies, from, the, persian, gulf, despite, these, reservations, and, fears, since, the, late, 1980s, azerbaijan, kazakhstan, and, turkmenistan, have, gradually, moved, to, centre, stage, in, the, global, energy, markets, and, are, now, regarded, as, key, factors, of, the, international, energy, security, azerbaijan, and, kazakhstan, in, particular, have, succeeded, in, attracting, massive, foreign, investment, to, their, oil, and, gas, sectors, according, to, gawdat, bahgat, the, investment, flow, suggests, that, the, geological, potential, of, the, caspian, region, as, a, major, source, of, oil, and, gas, is, not, in, doubt, russia, and, kazakhstan, started, a, closer, energy, co, operation, in, 1998, which, was, further, consolidated, in, may, 2002, when, presidents, vladimir, putin, and, nursultan, nazarbayev, signed, a, protocol, dividing, three, gas, fields, kurmangazy, tsentralnoye, and, khvalynskoye, on, an, equal, basis, following, the, ratification, of, bilateral, treaties, russia, kazakhstan, and, azerbaijan, declared, that, the, northern, caspian, was, open, for, business, and, investment, as, they, had, reached, a, consensus, on, the, legal, status, of, the, basin, iran, and, turkmenistan, refused, however, to, recognise, the, validity, of, these, bilateral, agreements, iran, is, rejecting, any, bilateral, agreement, to, divide, the, caspian, on, the, other, hand, us, choices, in, the, region, within, the, framework, of, the, so, called, pipeline, diplomacy, such, as, the, strong, support, of, the, baku, pipeline, the, project, was, eventually, approved, and, was, completed, in, 2005, reflect, a, political, desire, to, avoid, both, russia, and, iran, increasingly, other, powers, have, begun, to, involve, themselves, in, central, asia, soon, after, the, central, asian, states, won, their, independence, turkey, began, to, look, east, and, a, number, of, organizations, are, attempting, to, build, links, between, the, western, and, eastern, turks, iran, which, for, millennia, had, close, links, with, the, region, has, also, been, working, to, build, ties, and, the, central, asian, states, now, have, good, relations, with, the, islamic, republic, one, important, player, in, the, new, central, asia, has, been, saudi, arabia, which, has, been, funding, the, islamic, revival, in, the, region, olcott, notes, that, soon, after, independence, saudi, money, paid, for, massive, shipments, of, qurans, to, the, region, and, for, the, construction, and, repair, of, a, large, number, of, mosques, in, tajikistan, alone, an, estimated, 500, mosques, per, year, have, been, erected, with, saudi, money, the, formerly, atheistic, communist, party, leaders, have, mostly, converted, to, islam, small, islamist, groups, have, formed, in, several, of, the, countries, but, radical, islam, has, little, history, in, the, region, the, central, asian, societies, have, remained, largely, secular, and, all, five, states, enjoy, good, relations, with, israel, central, asia, is, still, home, to, a, large, jewish, population, the, largest, group, being, the, bukharan, jews, and, important, trade, and, business, links, have, developed, between, those, that, left, for, israel, after, independence, and, those, remaining, china, sees, the, region, as, an, essential, future, source, of, raw, materials, most, central, asian, countries, are, members, of, the, shanghai, cooperation, organisation, this, has, affected, xinjiang, and, other, parts, of, western, china, that, have, seen, infrastructure, programs, building, new, links, and, also, new, military, facilities, chinese, central, asia, has, been, far, from, the, centre, of, that, country, s, economic, boom, and, the, area, has, remained, considerably, poorer, than, the, coast, china, also, sees, a, threat, in, the, potential, of, the, new, states, to, support, separatist, movements, among, its, own, turkic, minorities, one, important, soviet, legacy, that, has, only, gradually, been, appreciated, is, the, vast, ecological, destruction, most, notable, is, the, gradual, drying, of, the, aral, sea, during, the, soviet, era, it, was, decided, that, the, traditional, crops, of, melons, and, vegetables, would, be, replaced, by, water, intensive, growing, of, cotton, for, soviet, textile, mills, massive, irrigation, efforts, were, launched, that, diverted, a, considerable, percentage, of, the, annual, inflow, to, the, sea, causing, it, to, shrink, steadily, furthermore, vast, tracts, of, kazakhstan, were, used, for, nuclear, testing, and, there, exists, a, plethora, of, decrepit, factories, and, mines, in, the, first, part, of, 2008, central, asia, experienced, a, severe, energy, crisis, a, shortage, of, both, electricity, and, fuel, aggravated, by, abnormally, cold, temperatures, failing, infrastructure, and, a, shortage, of, food, in, which, aid, from, the, west, began, to, assist, the, region, as, of, 2019, despite, its, common, cultural, and, historical, past, central, asia, has, been, one, of, the, least, integrated, regions, in, the, world, 1927
