subcontinent, include, the, invasions, which, started, in, the, northwestern, subcontinent, modern, day, pakistan, especially, the, umayyad, campaigns, during, the, 8th, century, mahmud, of, ghazni, sultan, of, the, ghaznavid, empire, preserved, an, ideological, link, to, the, suzerainty, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, and, invaded, vast, parts, of, punjab, and, gujarat, during, the, 11th, century, after, the, capture, of, lahore, and, the, end, of, the, ghaznavids, the, ghurid, ruler, muhammad, of, ghor, laid, the, foundation, of, muslim, rule, in, india, in, 1192, in, 1202, bakhtiyar, khalji, led, the, muslim, conquest, of, bengal, marking, the, easternmost, expansion, of, islam, at, the, time, the, ghurid, empire, soon, evolved, into, the, delhi, sultanate, in, 1206, ruled, by, qutb, ud, din, aibak, the, founder, of, the, mamluk, dynasty, with, the, delhi, sultanate, established, islam, was, spread, across, most, parts, of, the, indian, subcontinent, in, the, 14th, century, the, khalji, dynasty, under, alauddin, khalji, extended, muslim, rule, southwards, to, gujarat, rajasthan, and, the, deccan, the, successor, tughlaq, dynasty, temporarily, expanded, its, territorial, reach, to, tamil, nadu, the, disintegration, of, the, delhi, sultanate, capped, by, timur, s, invasion, in, 1398, caused, several, muslim, sultanates, and, dynasties, to, emerge, across, the, indian, subcontinent, such, as, the, gujarat, sultanate, malwa, sultanate, bahmani, sultanate, jaunpur, sultanate, madurai, sultanate, and, the, bengal, sultanate, some, of, these, however, were, followed, by, hindu, reconquests, and, resistance, from, the, native, powers, and, states, such, as, the, telugu, nayakas, vijayanagara, and, rajput, states, the, delhi, sultanate, was, replaced, by, the, mughal, empire, in, 1526, which, was, one, of, the, three, gunpowder, empires, emperor, akbar, gradually, enlarged, the, mughal, empire, to, include, a, large, portion, of, the, subcontinent, under, akbar, who, stressed, the, importance, of, religious, tolerance, and, winning, over, the, goodwill, of, the, subjects, a, multicultural, empire, came, into, being, with, various, non, muslim, subjects, being, actively, integrated, into, the, mughal, empire, s, bureaucracy, and, military, machinery, the, economic, and, territorial, zenith, of, the, mughals, was, reached, at, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, when, under, the, reign, of, emperor, aurangzeb, the, empire, witnessed, the, full, establishment, of, islamic, sharia, through, the, fatawa, al, alamgir, the, mughals, went, into, a, sudden, decline, immediately, after, achieving, their, peak, following, the, death, of, aurangzeb, in, 1707, due, to, a, lack, of, competent, and, effective, rulers, among, aurangzeb, s, successors, other, factors, included, the, expensive, and, bloody, mughal, rajput, wars, and, the, mughal, maratha, wars, the, afsharid, ruler, nader, shah, s, invasion, in, 1739, was, an, unexpected, attack, which, demonstrated, the, weakness, of, the, mughal, empire, this, provided, opportunities, for, various, regional, states, such, as, rajput, states, mysore, kingdom, sindh, state, nawabs, of, bengal, and, murshidabad, maratha, empire, sikh, empire, and, nizams, of, hyderabad, to, declare, their, independence, and, exercising, control, over, large, regions, of, the, indian, subcontinent, further, accelerating, the, geopolitical, disintegration, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, maratha, empire, replaced, mughals, as, the, dominant, power, of, the, subcontinent, from, 1720, to, 1818, the, muslim, conquests, in, indian, subcontinent, came, to, a, halt, after, the, battle, of, plassey, 1757, the, battle, of, buxar, 1764, anglo, mysore, wars, 1767, 1799, anglo, maratha, wars, 1775, 1818, and, anglo, sikh, wars, 1845, 1848, as, the, british, east, india, company, seized, control, of, much, of, the, indian, subcontinent, up, till, 1857, throughout, the, 18th, century, european, powers, continued, to, exert, a, large, amount, of, political, influence, over, the, indian, subcontinent, and, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, most, of, the, indian, subcontinent, came, under, european, colonial, domination, most, notably, the, british, raj, until, 1947, the, first, ever, recorded, incursion, by, arabs, in, india, occurred, around, 636, 7, ad, during, the, rashidun, caliphate, long, before, any, arab, army, reached, the, frontier, of, india, by, land, uthman, ibn, abi, al, as, al, thaqafi, the, governor, of, bahrain, and, oman, had, dispatched, naval, expeditions, against, the, sasanian, coast, and, further, east, to, the, borders, of, india, as, confirmed, by, the, contemporary, armenian, historian, sebeos, uthman, on, his, own, initiative, and, without, the, sanction, of, caliph, umar, according, to, the, history, of, al, baladhuri, had, also, launched, two, naval, raids, against, ports, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, first, of, these, raids, targeted, thane, a, small, town, near, mumbai, and, bharuch, a, city, in, gujarat, the, second, raid, targeted, debal, a, town, near, karachi, the, assault, on, thane, the, first, recorded, arab, raid, on, india, was, commanded, by, uthman, s, brother, al, hakam, who, also, led, the, raid, on, bharuch, the, following, raid, on, debal, was, commanded, by, another, brother, al, mughira, the, raids, were, probably, launched, in, c, 636, according, to, al, baladhuri, these, expeditions, were, not, sanctioned, by, caliph, umar, and, uthman, escaped, punishment, only, because, there, weren, t, any, casualties, the, raids, on, thane, and, bharuch, may, have, been, successful, as, the, arabs, had, lost, no, men, during, these, raids, but, al, baladhuri, does, not, specifically, state, these, raids, as, successful, al, bal, dhur, 1924, p, 209, so, some, scholars, are, of, the, opinion, that, the, arabs, raids, may, have, been, failures, and, forced, the, arabs, to, retreat, the, raid, on, debal, may, have, occurred, in, 643, ad, and, faced, success, but, it, is, unlikely, as, umar, was, still, the, caliph, and, uthman, was, unlikely, to, disobey, his, directive, on, sea, raids, and, the, source, reporting, this, is, deemed, unreliable, the, motivation, for, these, expeditions, may, have, been, to, seek, plunder, or, to, attack, pirates, to, safeguard, arabian, trade, in, the, arabian, sea, not, to, start, the, conquest, of, india, shortly, after, the, muslim, conquest, of, persia, the, connection, between, the, sindh, and, islam, was, established, by, the, initial, muslim, missions, during, the, rashidun, caliphate, the, kingdoms, of, kapisa, gandhara, in, modern, day, afghanistan, zabulistan, and, sindh, which, then, held, makran, in, modern, day, pakistan, all, of, which, were, culturally, part, of, indian, subcontinent, since, ancient, times, were, known, as, the, frontier, of, al, hind, to, the, arabs, makran, had, been, conquered, by, chach, of, aror, in, 631, ad, but, ten, years, later, it, was, described, as, under, the, government, of, persia, by, xuanzang, who, had, visited, the, region, in, 641, the, first, clash, between, a, ruler, of, an, indian, kingdom, and, the, arabs, took, place, in, 643, when, arab, forces, defeated, rutbil, the, king, of, zabulistan, in, sistan, arabs, led, by, suhail, b, abdi, later, defeated, a, sindhi, army, in, the, battle, of, rasil, in, 644, on, the, indian, ocean, coast, then, reached, the, indus, river, caliph, umar, ibn, al, khattab, denied, suhail, permission, to, carry, on, across, the, river, al, hakim, ibn, jabalah, al, abdi, who, attacked, makran, in, the, year, 649, ad, was, an, early, partisan, of, ali, ibn, abu, talib, abdullah, ibn, aamir, led, the, invasion, of, khurasan, in, 650, ad, and, his, general, rabi, b, ziyad, al, harithi, attacked, sistan, and, took, zaranj, and, surrounding, areas, in, 651, while, ahnaf, ibn, qais, conquered, the, hepthalites, of, herat, and, advanced, up, to, balkh, by, 653, arab, conquests, now, bordered, the, kingdoms, of, kapisa, zabul, and, sindh, in, modern, day, afghanistan, and, pakistan, the, arabs, levied, annual, tributes, on, the, newly, captured, areas, and, after, leaving, 4, 000, men, garrisons, at, merv, and, zaranj, retired, to, iraq, instead, of, pushing, on, against, the, frontier, of, india, caliph, uthman, b, affan, sanctioned, an, attack, against, makran, in, 652, and, sent, a, recon, mission, to, sindh, in, 653, the, mission, described, makran, as, inhospitable, and, caliph, uthman, probably, assuming, the, country, beyond, the, indus, was, much, worse, forbade, any, further, incursions, into, indian, subcontinent, during, the, caliphate, of, ali, many, hindus, of, sindh, had, come, under, the, influence, of, shi, ism, and, some, even, participated, in, the, battle, of, camel, and, died, fighting, for, ali, under, the, umayyads, 661, 750, ad, many, shias, sought, asylum, in, the, region, of, sindh, to, live, in, relative, peace, in, the, remote, area, ziyad, hindi, was, one, of, those, refugees, mu, awiya, i, established, the, umayyad, rule, over, the, arabs, after, the,

against, kapisa, zabul, and, what, is, now, pakistani, balochistan, abdur, rahman, b, samurra, besieged, kabul, in, 663, ad, while, haris, b, marrah, advanced, against, kalat, after, marching, through, fannazabur, and, quandabil, and, moving, through, the, bolan, pass, king, chach, of, sindh, sent, an, army, against, the, arabs, the, arabs, were, trapped, when, the, enemy, blocked, the, mountain, passes, haris, was, killed, and, his, army, was, annihilated, al, muhallab, ibn, abi, sufra, took, a, detachment, through, the, khyber, pass, towards, multan, in, southern, punjab, in,

and, zunbil, began, assisting, in, organizing, resistance, against, the, arabs, in, makran, this, was, the, beginning, of, a, prolonged, struggle, between, the, rulers, of, kabul, and, zabul, in, modern, day, and, pakistan, against, successive, arab, governors, of, sistan, khurasan, and, makran, the, kabul, shahi, kings, and, their, zunbil, kinsmen, successfully, blocked, access, to, the, khyber, pass, and, gomal, pass, routes, into, india, from, 653, to, 870, ad, while, modern, balochistan, pakistan, comprising, the, areas, of, kikan, or, qiqanan, nukan, turan, buqan, qufs, mashkey, and, makran, would, face, several, arab, expeditions, between, 661, and, 711, ad, the, arabs, launched, several, raids, against, these, frontier, lands, but, repeated, rebellions, in, sistan, and, khurasan, between, 653, and, 691, ad, diverted, much, of, their, military, resources, in, order, to, subdue, these, breakaway, provinces, and, away, from, expansion, into, al, hind, muslim, control, of, these, areas, ebbed, and, flowed, repeatedly, as, a, result, until, 870, ad, arab, troops, disliked, being, stationed, in, makran, fierce, resistance, stalled, arab, progress, repeatedly, in, the, frontier, zone, and, the, arabs, had, to, focus, on, tribute, extraction, instead, of, systematic, conquest, as, a, result, arabs, launched, several, campaigns, in, eastern, balochistan, between, 661, and, 681, ad, four, arab, commanders, were, killed, during, these, campaigns, however, sinan, b, salma, managed, to, conquer, parts, of, makran, including, the, chagai, area, and, established, a,

of, numerous, members, of, arab, nobility, his, methodical, 699, ad, campaign, made, gains, but, he, was, contemptuously, rebuked, by, hajjaj, at, every, step, when, ibn, al, ash, ath, paused, his, operation, to, consolidate, hajjaj, insulted, him, and, ordered, an, immediate, advance, this, unreasonable, demand, led, to, mutiny, the, mutiny, was, put, down, by, 704, ad, and, al, hajjaj, granted, a, 7, year, truce, to, zunbil, meds, pirates, operated, from, their, bases, at, kutch, debal, and, kathiawar, and, during, one, of, their, raids, had, kidnapped, muslim, women, travelling,

indian, historian, romila, thapar, who, claim, that, such, views, are, unfounded, or, exaggerated, considerable, controversy, exists, both, in, scholarly, and, public, opinion, about, the, conversions, to, islam, typically, represented, by, the, following, schools, of, thought, embedded, within, this, lies, the, concept, of, islam, as, a, foreign, imposition, and, hinduism, being, a,

partition, and, communalism, in, india, historians, such, as, will, durant, described, islamic, invasions, of, india, as, the, bloodiest, story, in, history, jadunath, sarkar, contends, that, several, muslim, invaders, were, waging, a, systematic, jihad, against, hindus, in, india, to, the, effect, that, every, device, short, of, massacre, in, cold, blood, was, resorted, to, in, order, to, convert, heathen, subjects, hindus, who, converted, to, islam, however, were, not, completely, immune, to, persecution, due, to, the, caste, system, among, muslims, in, india, established, by, ziauddin, al, barani, in, the, fatawa, i, jahandari, where, they, were, regarded, as, an, ajlaf, caste, and, subjected, to, discrimination, by, the, ashraf, castes, others, argue, that, during, the, muslim,

monasteries, and, forced, conversions, on, the, battlefield, disputers, of, the, conversion, by, the, sword, theory, point, to, the, presence, of, the, large, muslim, communities, found, in, southern,

heartland, of, historical, muslim, empires, in, the, indian, subcontinent, as, a, refutation, to, the, conversion, by, the, sword, theory, the, legacy, of, the, muslim, conquest, of, south, asia, is, a, hotly, debated, issue, and, argued, even, today, muslim, invaders, were, not, all, simply, raiders, later, rulers, fought, on, to, win, kingdoms, and, stayed, to, create, new, ruling, dynasties, the, practices, of, these, new, rulers, and, their, subsequent, heirs, some, of, whom, were, born, to, hindu, wives, varied, considerably, while, some, were, uniformly, hated, others, developed, a, popular, following, according, to, the, memoirs, of, ibn, battuta, who, travelled, through, delhi, in, the, 14th, century, one, of, the, previous, sultans, had, been, especially, brutal, and, was, deeply, hated, by, delhi, s, population, batuta, s, memoirs, also, indicate, that, muslims, from, the, arab, world, persia, and, anatolia, were, often, favoured, with, important, posts, at, the,

and, gardeners, to, high, administrative, posts, in, his, reign, it, is, likely, that, conversions, to, islam, took, place, as, a, means, of, seeking, greater, social, mobility, and, improved, social, standing, numerous, temples, were, destroyed, by, muslim, conquerors, richard, m, eaton, lists, a, total, of, 80, temples, that, were, desecrated, by, muslim, conquerors, but, notes, this, was, not, unusual, in, medieval, india, where, numerous, temples, were, also, desecrated, by, hindu, and, buddhist, kings, against, rival, indian, kingdoms, during, conflicts, between, devotees, of, different, hindu, deities, and, between, hindus, buddhists, and, jains, he, also, notes, there, were, many, instances, of, the, delhi, sultanate, which, often, had, hindu, ministers, ordering, the, protection, maintenance, and, repairing, of, temples, according, to, both, muslim, and, hindu, sources, and, that, attacks, on, temples, had, significantly, declined, under, the, mughal, empire, k, s, lal, in, his, book, growth, of, muslim, population, in, medieval, india, claimed, that, between, 1000, and, 1500, the, indian, population, decreased, by, 30, million, but, stated, his, estimates, were, tentative, and, did, not, claim, any, finality, his, work, has, come, under, criticism, by, historians, such, as, simon, digby, soas, university, of, london, and, irfan, habib, for, its, agenda, and, lack, of, accurate, data, in, pre, census, times, different, population, estimates, by, economics, historians, angus, maddison, and, jean, no, l, biraben, also, indicate, that, india, s, population, did, not, decrease, between, 1000, and, 1500, but, increased, by, tens, of, millions, during, that, time, the, indian, population, estimates, from, other, economic, historians, including, colin,

and, because, hindu, kings, of, south, india, such, as, the, cholas, hired, muslim, mercenaries, a, significant, aspect, of, the, muslim, period, in, world, history, was, the, emergence, of, islamic, sharia, courts, capable, of, imposing, a, common, commercial, and, legal, system, that, extended, from, morocco, in, the, west, to, mongolia, in, the, north, east, and, indonesia, in, the, south,

and, as, islam, spread, through, africa, it, became, a, highly, centralising, force, that, facilitated, in, the, creation, of, a, common, legal, system, that, allowed, letters, of, credit, issued, in, say, egypt, or, tunisia, to, be, honoured, in, india, or, indonesia, sharia, has, laws, on, the, transaction, of, business, with, both, muslims, and, non, muslims, to, cement, their, rules, muslim, rulers, initially, promoted, a, system, in, which, there, was, a, revolving, door, between, the, clergy, the, administrative, nobility, and, the, mercantile, classes, the, travels, of, explorer, muhammad, ibn, abdullah, ibn, batuta, were, eased, because, of, this, system, he, served, as, an, imam, in, delhi, as, a, judicial, official, in, the, maldives, and, as, an, envoy, and, trader, in, the, malabar, there, was, never, a, contradiction, in, any, of, his, positions, because, each, of, these, roles, complemented, the, other, islam, created, a, compact, under, which, political, power, law, and, religion, became, fused, in, a, manner, so, as, to, safeguard, the, interests, of, the, mercantile, class, this, led, world, trade, to, expand, to, the, maximum, extent, possible, in, the, medieval, world, sher, shah, suri, took, initiatives, in, improvement, of, trade, by, abolishing, all, taxes, which, hindered, progress, of, free, trade, he, built, large, networks, of, roads, and,

others, in, the, level, of, assimilation, and, syncretism, that, occurred, they, retained, their, identity, and, introduced, legal, and, administrative, systems, that, superseded, existing, systems, of, social, conduct, and, ethics, while, this, was, a, source, of, friction, it, resulted, in, a, unique, experience, the, legacy, of, which, is, a, muslim, community, strongly, islamic, in, character, while, at, the, same, time, distinctive, and, unique, among, its, peers, the, impact, of, islam, on, indian, culture, has, been, inestimable, it, permanently, influenced, the, development, of, all, areas, of, human, endeavour, language, dress, cuisine, all, the, art, forms, architecture, and, urban, design, and, social, customs, and, values, conversely, the, languages, of, the, muslim, invaders, were, modified, by, contact, with, local, languages, to, urdu, which, uses, the, arabic, script, this, language, was, also, known, as, hindustani, an, umbrella, term, used, for, the, vernacular, terminology, of, hindi, as, well, as, urdu, both, major, languages, in, south, asia, today, derived, primarily, from, sanskrit, grammatical, structures, and, vocabulary, muslim, rule, saw, a, greater, urbanisation, of, india, and, the, rise, of, many, cities, and, their, urban, cultures, the, biggest, impact, was, upon, trade, resulting, from, a, common, commercial, and, legal, system, extending, from, morocco, to, indonesia, this, change, of, emphasis, on, mercantilism, and, trade, from, the, more, strongly, centralised, governance, systems, further, clashed, with, the, agricultural, based, traditional, economy, and, also, provided, fuel, for, social, and, political, tensions, a, related, development, to, the, shifting, economic, conditions, was, the, establishment, of, karkhanas, or, small, factories, and, the, import, and, dissemination, of, technology, through, india, and, the, rest, of, the, world, the, use, of, ceramic, tiles, was, adopted, from,

and, the, hindu, numerals, were, spread, to, the, rest, of, the, world, and, much, of, the, scholarly, work, and, advances, in, the, sciences, of, the, age, under, muslim, nations, across, the, globe, were, imported, by, the, liberal, patronage, of, arts, and, sciences, by, the, rulers, the, languages, brought, by, islam, were, modified, by, contact, with, local, languages, leading, to, the, creation, of, several, new, languages, such, as, urdu, which, uses, the, modified, arabic, script, but, with, more, persian, words, the, influences, of, these, languages, exist, in, several, dialects,

many, of, the, ancient, indian, architectural, marvels, and, converted, them, into, islamic, structures, most, notably, at, varanasi, mathura, ayodhya, and, the, kutub, complex, in, new, delhi, few, groups, of, hindus, including, rajputs, were, entering, what, is, today, nepal, before, the, fall, of, chittor, due, to, regular, invasions, of, muslims, in, india, after, the, fall, of, chittorgarh, in, 1303, by, the, alauddin, khilji, of, the, khalji, dynasty, rajputs, from, the, region, immigrated, in, large, groups, into, what, is, today, nepal, due, to, heavy, religious, persecution, the, incident, is, supported, by, both, the, rajput, and, nepalese, traditions, historian, john, t, hitchcock, and, john, whelpton, contends, that, the, regular, invasions, by, muslims, led, to, heavy, influx, of, rajputs, with, brahmins, from, the, 12th, century, parts, of, india, have, been, subject, to, muslim, rule, from, the, period, of, muhammad, ibn, qasim, till, the, fall, of, the, mughal, empire, while, there, is, a, tendency, to, view, the, muslim, conquests, and, muslim, empires, as, a, prolonged, period, of, violence, against, hindu, culture, in, between, the, periods, of, wars, and, conquests, there, were, harmonious, hindu, muslim, relations, in, most, indian, communities, and, the, indian, population, grew, during, the, medieval, muslim, times, no, populations, were, expelled, based, on, their, religion, by, either, the, muslim, or, hindu, kings, nor, were, attempts, made, to, annihilate, a, specific, religion, according, to, romila, thapar, with, the, onset, of, muslim, rule, all, indians, higher, and, lower, caste, were, lumped, together, in, the, category, of, hindus, while, higher, caste, indians, regarded, lower, castes, to, be, impure, they, were, now, regarded, as, belonging, to, a, similar, category, which, partly, explains, the, belief, among, many, higher, caste, indians, hinduism, in, the, last, one, thousand, years, has, been, through, the, most, severe, persecution, that, any, religion, in, the, world, has, ever, undergone, thapar, further, notes, that, the, need, to, exaggerate, the, persecution, at, the, hands, of, the, muslim, is, required, to, justify, the, inculcation, of, anti, muslim, sentiments, among, the, hindus, of, today, hindutva, allies, have, even, framed, the, muslim, violence, against, hindu, expressions, of, faith, as, a, hindu, holocaust, romila, thapar, states, that, the, belief, in, a, severe, persecution, in, the, last, millennium, brushes, away, the, various, expressions, of, religious, persecution, in, india, prior, to, the, coming, of, the, muslims, and, particularly, between, the, aiva, and, the, buddhist, and, jaina, sects, she, questions, what, persecution, means, and, if, it, means, religious, conversions, she, doubts, that, conversions, can, be, interpreted, as, forms, of, persecution, it, is, quite, correct, to, mention, that, muslim, iconoclasts, destroyed, temples, and, the, broke, images, of, hindus, states, thapar, it, should, also, be, mentioned, that, muslim, rulers, made, donations, to, hindu, sects, during, their, rule, during, the, islamic, rule, period, states, david, lorenzen, there, was, state, sponsored, persecution, against, hindus, yet, it, was, sporadic, and, directed, mostly, at, hindu, religious, monuments, according, to, deepa, ollapally, the, mughal, emperor, aurangzeb, was, clearly, discriminatory, towards, hindu, and, all, other, non, muslims, displaying, an, unprecedented, level, of, religious, bigotry, but, perhaps, this, was, a, consequence, of, the, opposition, he, faced, from, a, number, of, his, family, members, during, the, medieval, span, she, states, episodes, of, direct, religious, persecution, of, hindus, were, rare, as, were, communal, riots, between, hindus, and, muslims, according, to, wink, the, mutilation, and, destruction, of, hindu, religious, idols, and, temples, were, an, attack, on, hindu, religious, practice, and, the, muslim, destruction, of, religious, architecture, was, a, means, to, eradicate, the, vestiges, of, hindu, religious, symbols, muslim, texts, of, this, period, justify, it, based, on, their, contempt, and, abhorence, for, idols, and, idolators, in, islamic, thought, jackson, notes, that, the, muslim, historians, of, the, medieval, era, viewed, the, creation, and, expansion, of, islamic, sultanates, in, hindustan, as, holy, war, and, a, religious, conquest, characterizing, muslim, forces, as, the, army, of, islam, and, the, hindus, as, infidels, yet, states, jackson, these, records, need, to, be, interpreted, and, relied, upon, with, care, given, their, tendencies, to, exaggerate, this, was, not, a, period, of, uncompromising, iconoclasm, states, jackson, cities, that, quickly, surrendered, to, the, islamic, army, says, jackson, got, a, better, deal, for, their, religious, monuments, according, to, richard, davis, targeting, sacred, temples, was, not, unique, to, muslim, rulers, in, india, some, hindu, kings, too, prior, to, the, formation, of, first, islamic, sultanates, in, india, expropriated, sacred, idols, from, temples, and, took, it, back, to, their, capitals, as, a, political, symbol, of, victory, however, the, sacred, temples, icons, and, the, looted, image, carried, away, was, still, sacred, and, treated, with, respect, by, the, victorious, hindu, king, and, his, forces, states, richard, davis, there, is, hardly, any, evidence, of, mutilation, of, divine, images, and, intentional, defilement, of, hindu, sacred, icons, or, temples, by, armies, in, control, of, hindu, rulers, the, evidence, that, is, available, suggests, that, the, victorious, hindu, kings, undertook, significant, effort, to, house, the, expropriated, images, in, new, grand, temples, within, their, kingdom, according, to, wink, hindu, destruction, of, buddhist, and, jain, places, of, worship, took, place, before, the, 10th, century, but, the, evidence, for, such, hindu, iconoclasm, is, incidental, too, vague, and, unconvincing, according, to, wink, mutilation, and, defilement, of, sacred, icons, is, rarely, evidenced, in, hindu, texts, in, contrast, to,

these, hindu, jats, also, suffered, restrictions, and, discrimination, as, non, muslims, as, was, then, usual, elsewhere, for, the, non, muslim, subjects, ahl, adh, dhimma, per, the, islamic, law, sharia, states, wink, yohanan, friedmann, however, finds, that, the, chach, nama, holds, that, most, contemporary, religious, as, well, as, political, authorities, collaborated, with, the, invaders, and, those, who, promptly, surrendered, were, not, only, gifted, with, huge, sums, of, money, but, also, entrusted, to, rule, conquered, territories, friedmann, also, notes, that, bin, qasim, gave, his, unqualified, blessing, to, the, characteristic, features, of, the, society, he, reappointed, every, deposed, brahmin, of, brahmanabad, to, their, jobs, exempted, them, from, jizya, allowed,

indian, society, friedmann, 1984, pp, 34, according, to, johnson, and, koyama, quoting, bosworth, there, were, certainly, massacres, in, the, towns, in, the, early, stages, of, campaign, against, pagan, hindus, in, sind, but, eventually, they, were, granted, dhimmi, status, and, peace, treaties, were, made, with, them, after, the, conquest, of, sindh, qasim, chose, the, hanafi, school, of, islamic, law, which, stated, that, when, under, muslim, rule, people, of, indic, religions, such, as, hindus, buddhists, and, jains, are, to, be, regarded, as, dhimmis, from, the, arab, term, as, well, as, people, of, the, book, and, are, required, to, pay, jizya, for, religious, freedom, the, historicity, of, the, chach, nama, has, been, questioned, francesco, gabrieli, considers, the, chach, nama, to, be, a, historical, romance, which, was, a, late, and, doubtful, source, for, information, about, bin, qasim, and, must, be, carefully, sieved, to, locate, the, facts, on, such, a, reading, he, admired, bin, qasim, s, proclamations, concerning, principle, of, tolerance, and, religious, freedom, peter, hardy, takes, a, roughly, similar, stance, and, lenses, the, work, as, a, work, of, political, theory, manan, ahmed, asif, criticizes, the, very, premises, of, recovering, portions, of, the, chach, nama, as, a, historical, chronicle, of, muslim, conquest, he, argues, that, the, site, and, times, of, production, dictated, its, entire, content, and, that, it, must, be, read, in, entirety, as, an, original, work, in, the, genre, of, political, theory, where, history, is, creatively, extrapolated, with, romantic, fiction, to, gain, favor, in, the, court, of, nasiruddin, qabacha, wink, states, that, some, scholars, treat, the, chach, nama, and, other, muslim, texts, of, its, era,

common, elements, in, these, diverse, sources, suggest, that, hindus, were, treated, as, dhimmis, and, targeted, for, certain, discriminatory, measures, prescribed, in, the, sharia, as, well, as, entitled, to, protection, and, limited, religious, freedoms, in, a, muslim, state, muslim, texts, of, that, period, are, replete, with, iconoclast, rhetoric, descriptions, of, mass, slaughter, of,

thousands, the, pervasive, and, most, striking, feature, of, the, arabic, literature, on, sind, and, hind, of, the, 11th, to, 13th, century, is, its, constant, obsession, with, idol, worship, and, polytheism, in, the, indian, subcontinent, there, is, piecemeal, evidence, of, iconoclasm, that, began, in, sind, region, but, the, wholesale, and, more, systematic, onslaught, against, major, hindu, religious, monuments, is, evidenced, in, north, india, richard, eaton, sunil, kumar, romila, thapar, richard, h, davis, and, others, argue, that, these, iconoclastic, actions, were, not, primarily, driven, by, religious, zeal, but, were, politically, strategic, acts, of, destruction, in, that, temples, in, medieval, india, were, sites, associated, with, sovereignty, royal, power, money, and,

muslim, texts, of, this, period, remarking, that, the, sultan, had, a, duty, eradicate, infidelity, and, humiliate, his, hindu, subjects, some, of, the, conquered, hindu, subjects, of, the, delhi, sultanate, served, these, sultans, who, states, jackson, were, doubtless, usually, slaves, these, hindus, built, the, mosques, of, this, era, as, well, as, developed, the, indo, islamic, architecture, some, served, the, court, in, roles, such, as, treasurers, clerks, minting, of, new, coins, and, others, these, hindus, were, not, persecuted, instead, some, were, rewarded, with, immunities, and, tax, exemptions, additionally, captured, hindu, slaves, were, added, as, infantry, troops, in, the, sultanate, s, army, for, their, campaign, against, other, hindu, kingdoms, some, sultans, adopted, indian, customs, such, as, ceremonial, riding, of, elephants, by, kings, thus, facilitating, the, public, perception, of, the, new, monarch, this, suggest, that, the, sultans, cultivated, some, hindus, to, serve, their, aims, rather, than, indiscriminately, persecute, every, hindu, in, general, hindu, subjects, of, delhi, sultanate, were, generally, accepted, as, people, with, dhimmi, status, not, equal, to, muslims, but, protected, subject, to, jizya, tax, and, with, a, list, of, restrictions, early, sultans, of, the, delhi, sultanate, exempted, the, brahmins, from, having, to, pay, jizya, thus, dividing, the, hindus, and, placing, the, discriminatory, tax, burden, entirely, on, the, non, brahmin, strata, of, the, hindu, society, firuz, shah, was, the, first, to, impose, the, jizya, on, brahmins, and, wrote, in, his, autobiography, that, countless, hindus, converted, to, islam, when, he, issued, the, edict, that, conversion, would, release, them, of, the, requirement, to, pay, jizya, this, discrimination, against, hindus, was, in, force, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 14th, century, states, jackson, yet, it, is, difficult, to, establish, if, and, how, this, was, enforced, outside, of, the, major, centers, under, muslim, control, the, muslim, commanders, of, delhi, sultanate, regularly, raided, hindu, kingdoms, for, plunder, mulct, their, treasuries, and, looted, the, hindu, temples, therein, states, jackson, these, conquests, of, delhi, sultanate, armies, damaged, or, destroyed, many, hindu, temples, yet, in, a, few, instances, after, the, war, the, sultans, let, the, hindus, repair, and, reconstruct, their, temples, such, instances, states, jackson, has, been, cited, by, the, indian, scholar, p, b, desai, as, evidence, of, striking, degree, of, tolerance, by, muslim, sultans, but, this, happened, in, frontier, areas, after, they, had, recently, been, conquered, and, placed, in, direct, muslim, rule, where, the, sultan, s, authority, was, highly, precarious, within, regions, that, was, already, under, firm, control, of, the, delhi, sultanate, the, direct, evidence, of, this, is, meagre, one, example, referred, to, is, of, a, claimed, request, from, the, king, of, china, to, build, a, temple, in, india, as, recorded, by, ibn, battuta, that, is, questionable, and, has, no, corroborating, evidence, states, jackson, similar, few, examples, near, delhi, such, as, one, for, sri, krishna, bhagwan, temple, cannot, be, verified, whether, they, were, ever, built, either, some, modern, era, indian, texts, mention, that, hindu, and, jain, temples, of, delhi, sultanate, era, received, endowments, from, muslim, authorities, presenting, these, as, evidence, of, lack, of, persecution, during, this, period, it, is, not, beyond, the, bounds, of, possibility, that, in, some, instances, this, happened, but, generally, states, jackson, the, texts, and, even, the, memoirs, written, by, the, some, sultans, themselves, describe, how, they, set, about, destroying, new, temples, and, replacing, them, with, mosques, and, in, one, case, depopulated, a, town, of, hindus, and, resettled, muslims, there, jackson, clarifies, that, the, evidence, suggests, that, the, destroyed, temples, were, new, temples, and, not, the, old, one, s, near, delhi, whose, devotees, were, already, paying, regular, jizya, to, the, sultan, s, treasuries, in, some, cases, the, policies, on, destroying, or, letting, hindus, worship, in, their, old, temples, changed, as, sultans, changed, the, muslim, nobles, and, advisors, of, the, sultans, championed, persecution, of, hindus, the, muslim, texts, of, that, era, states, jackson, frequently, mention, themes, such, as, the, hindu, infidels, must, on, no, account, be, allowed, to, live, in, ease, and, affluence, they, should, not, be, treated, as, peoples, of, the, book, and, the, sultan, should, at, least, refrain, from, treating, hindus, with, honour, or, permitting, idolatry, in, the, capital, failure, to, slaughter, the, hindus, has, led, to, polytheism, taking, root, another, wazir, while, theoretically, agreeing, to, these, view, stated, that, this, would, not, be, practical, given, the, small, population, of, muslims, and, such, a, policy, should, be, deferred, till, muslims, were, in, a, stronger, position, if, eradication, of, hindus, is, not, possible, suggested, another, muslim, official, then, the, hindus, should, at, least, be, insulted, disgraced, and, dishonored, these, views, were, not, exceptions, rather, consistent, with, islamic, thinking, of, that, era, and, are, commonly, encountered, in, polemical, writing, against, the, infidel, in, different, parts, of, the, islamic, world, at, different, times, states, jackson, this, antagonism, towards, hindus, may, have, other, general, reasons, such, as, the, fear, of, apostasy, given, the, tendency, of, everyday, muslims, to, join, in, with, hindus, as, they, celebrated, their, religious, festivals, further, the, succession, struggle, after, the, death, of, a, sultan, usually, led, to, political, maneuvering, by, the, next, sultan, where, depending, on, the, circumstances, the, victor, championed, either, the, orthodox, segment, of, the, islamic, clergy, and, jurists, or, gave, concessions, to, the, hindus, and, other, groups, for, support, when, the, sultanate, facing, a, military, threat, from, outside, the, army, of, ala, al, din, khalji, from, delhi, sultanate, began, their, first, campaign, in, 1310, against, the, hindu, kingdom, in, madurai, region, called, ma, bar, by, court, historians, under, the, pretext, of, helping, sundar, pandya, according, to, mehrdad, shokoohy, a, scholar, of, islamic, studies, and, architectural, history, in, central, and, south, asia, this, campaign, lasted, for, a, year, during, which, madurai, and, other, tamil, region, cities, were, overrun, by, the, muslims, the, hindu, temples, were, demolished, and, the, towns, looted, a, detailed, record, about, the, campaign, by, amir, khusrau, the, destruction, and, plunder, a, second, destructive, campaign, was, launched, by, mubarak, shah, ala, al, din, khalji, s, successor, while, the, looted, wealth, was, sent, to, delhi, a, muslim, governor, was, appointed, for, the, region, the, governor, later, rebelled, founded, the, short, lived, madurai, sultanate, and, renamed, himself, as, sultan, ahsan, shah, in, 1334, the, successive, sultans, of, the, new, sultanate, did, not, have, the, support, of, the, regional, hindu, population, the, madurai, sultanate, s, army, states, shokoohy, often, exercised, fierce, and, brutal, repressive, methods, on, the, local, people, the, sultanate, faced, constant, battles, with, neighboring, hindu, states, and, assassination, by, its, own, nobles, sultan, sikandar, shah, was, the, last, sultan, he, was, killed, by, the, invading, forces, of, vijayanagara, empire, army, in, 1377, the, muslim, literature, of, this, period, record, the, motive, of, the, madurai, sultans, for, example, sultan, shams, al, din, adil, shah, s, general, is, described, as, leaving, for, holy, war, against, the, infidels, and, taking, from, them, great, wealth, and, a, vast, amount, of, booty, another, record, states, he, engaged, in, a, holy, war, ghaza, and, killed, a, great, number, of, infidels, madurai, region, has, several, islamic, shrines, with, tombs, built, during, this, period, such, as, one, for, ala, al, din, and, shams, al, din, in, this, shrine, the, inner, columns, are, irregular, and, vary, in, form, showing, evidence, of, reused, material, the, destruction, of, temples, and, the, re, use, of, their, materials, states, shokoohy, was, a, practice, of, the, early, sultanates, of, north, india, and, we, may, assume, that, this, tradition, was, brought, to, the, south, by, the, sultans, of, ma, bar, the, madurai, sultanate, sacked, and, desecrated, hindu, temples, throughout, the, tamil, country, and, these, were, restored, and, reconsecrated, for, worship, by, the, vijayanagara, rulers, states, the, indologist, crispin, branfoot, the, mughal, emperor, akbar, has, been, a, celebrated, unusual, example, of, tolerance, indologist, richard, eaton, writes, that, from, akbar, s, time, to, today, he, has, attracted, conflicting, labels, from, a, strict, muslim, to, an, apostate, from, a, free, thinker, to, a, crypto, hindu, from, a, zoroastrian, to, a, proto, christian, from, an, atheist, to, a, radical, innovator, as, a, youth, states, eaton, akbar, studied, islam, under, both, shia, and, sunni, tutors, but, as, an, adult, he, looked, back, with, regret, on, his, early, life, confessing, that, in, those, days, he, had, persecuted, men, into, conformity, with, my, faith, and, deemed, it, islam, in, his, later, years, he, felt, an, internal, bitterness, acknowledging, that, his, soul, had, been, seized, with, exceeding, sorrow, for, what, he, had, done, before, launching, his, campaign, to, treat, all, mughal, subjects, regardless, of, religion, on, a, basis, of, legal, equality, before, the, state, the, reign, of, aurangzeb, 1658, 1707, witnessed, one, of, the, strongest, campaigns, of, religious, violence, in, the, mughal, empire, s, history, aurangzeb, is, a, controversial, figure, in, modern, india, often, remembered, as, a, vile, oppressor, of, hindus, during, his, rule, aurangzeb, expanded, the, mughal, empire, conquering, much, of, southern, india, through, long, bloody, campaigns, against, non, muslims, he, forcibly, converted, hindus, to, islam, and, destroyed, hindu, temples, he, also, re, introduced, the, jizya, a, tax, on, non, muslims, which, had, been, suspended, for, the, previous, 100, years, by, his, great, grandfather, akbar, aurangzeb, ordered, the, desecration, and, destruction, of, temples, when, conquering, new, lands, and, putting, down, rebellions, punishing, political, leaders, by, destroying, the, temples, that, symbolized, their, power, in, 1669, he, issued, orders, to, all, his, governors, of, provinces, to, destroy, with, a, willing, hand, the, schools, and, temples, of, the, infidels, and, that, they, were, strictly, enjoined, to, put, an, entire, stop, to, the, teaching, and, practice, of, idolatrous, forms, of, worship, according, to, richard, eaton, these, orders, appear, to, have, been, directed, not, toward, hindu, temples, in, general, but, towards, a, more, narrowly, defined, deviant, group, the, number, of, hindu, temples, destroyed, or, desecrated, under, aurangzeb, s, rule, is, unclear, but, may, have, been, grossly, exaggerated, and, he, probably, built, more, temples, than, he, destroyed, according, to, ikram, aurangzeb, tried, to, enforce, strict, islamic, law, by, ordering, the, destruction, of, newly, built, hindu, temples, later, the, procedure, was, adopted, of, closing, down, rather, than, destroying, the, newly, built, temples, in, hindu, localities, it, is, also, true, that, very, often, the, orders, of, destruction, remained, a, dead, letter, some, temples, were, destroyed, entirely, in, other, cases, mosques, were, built, on, their, foundations, sometimes, using, the, same, stones, idols, in, temples, were, smashed, and, the, city, of, mathura, was, temporarily, renamed, as, islamabad, in, local, official, documents, the, persecution, during, the, islamic, period, targeted, non, hindus, as, well, in, some, cases, such, as, towards, the, end, of, mughal, era, the, violence, and, persecution, was, mutual, hindus, too, attacked, and, damaged, muslim, tombs, even, when, the, troops, had, orders, not, to, harm, religious, refuges, of, muslims, these, few, examples, of, disrespect, for, islamic, sites, states, indologist, nicholas, gier, pale, in,

nerun, brahmanadabad, alor, and, multan, one, after, the, other, in, quick, succession, and, in, less, than, a, year, and, a, half, the, far, flung, hindu, kingdom, was, crushed, there, was, a, fearful, out, break, of, religious, bigotry, in, several, places, and, temples, were, wantonly, desecrated, at, debal, nairun, and, aror, temples, were, demolished, and, converted, into, mosques, historian, richard, eaton, has, tabulated, a, campaign, of, destruction, of, idols, and, temples, by, delhi, sultans, intermixed, with, instances, of, years, where, the, temples, were, protected, from, desecration, in, his, paper, he, has, listed, 37, instances, of, hindu, temples, being, desecrated, or, destroyed, in, india, during, the, delhi, sultanate, from, 1234, to, 1518, for, which, reasonable, evidence, is, available, he, noted, that, this, was, not, unusual, in, medieval, india, as, there, were, numerous, recorded, instances, of, temple, desecration, by, hindu, and, buddhist, kings, against, rival, indian, kingdoms, between, 642, and, 1520, involving, conflict, between, devotees, of, different, hindu, deities, as, well, as, between, hindus, buddhists, and, jains, he, also, noted, there, were, also, many, instances, of, delhi, sultans, who, often, had, hindu, ministers, ordering, the, protection, maintenance, and, repairing, of, temples, according, to, both, muslim, and, hindu, sources, for, example, a, sanskrit, inscription, notes, that, sultan, muhammad, bin, tughluq, repaired, a, siva, temple, in, bidar, after, his, deccan, conquest, there, was, often, a, pattern, of, delhi, sultans, plundering, or, damaging, temples, during, conquest, and, then, patronizing, or, repairing, temples, after, conquest, this, pattern, came, to, an, end, with, the, mughal, empire, where, akbar, s, chief, minister, abu, l, fazl, criticized, the, excesses, of, earlier, sultans, such, as, mahmud, of, ghazni, in, many, cases, the, demolished, remains, rocks, and, broken, statue, pieces, of, temples, destroyed, by, delhi, sultans, were, reused, to, build, mosques, and, other, buildings, for, example, the, qutb, complex, in, delhi, was, built, from, stones, of, 27, demolished, hindu, and, jain, temples, by, some, accounts, similarly, the, muslim, mosque, in, khanapur, maharashtra, was, built, from, the, looted, parts, and, demolished, remains, of, hindu, temples, muhammad, bin, bakhtiyar, khalji, destroyed, buddhist, and, hindu, libraries, and, their, manuscripts, at, nalanda, and, odantapuri, universities, in, 1193, ce, at, the, beginning, of, the, delhi, sultanate, the, first, historical, record, in, this, period, of, a, campaign, of, destruction, of, temples, and, defacement, of, faces, or, heads, of, hindu, idols, lasted, from, 1193, through, 1194, in, rajasthan, punjab, haryana, and, uttar, pradesh, under, the, command, of, ghuri, under, the, mamluks, and, khaljis, the, campaign, of, temple, desecration, expanded, to, bihar, madhya, pradesh, gujarat, and, maharashtra, and, continued, through, the, late, 13th, century, orissa, temples, were, destroyed, in, the, 14th, century, under, the, tughlaqs, beyond, destruction, and, desecration, the, sultans, of, the, delhi, sultanate, in, some, cases, had, forbidden, reconstruction, or, repair, of, damaged, hindu, jain, and, buddhist, temples, in, certain, cases, the, sultanate, would, grant, a, permit, for, repairs, and, construction, of, temples, if, the, patron, or, religious, community, paid, jizya, fee, tax, for, example, according, to, ibn, battuta, s, account, a, proposal, by, the, yuan, dynasty, emperor, of, china, to, repair, himalayan, buddhist, temples, destroyed, by, the, sultanate, army, was, refused, on, the, grounds, that, such, temple, repairs, were, only, allowed, if, the, chinese, agreed, to, pay, jizya, tax, to, the, treasury, of, the, sultanate, according, to, eva, de, clercq, an, expert, in, the, study, of, jainism, the, delhi, sultans, did, not, strictly, prohibit, construction, of, new, temples, in, the, sultanate, islamic, law, notwithstanding, in, his, memoirs, firoz, shah, tughlaq, describes, how, he, destroyed, temples, and, built, mosques, instead, and, killed, those, who, dared, build, new, temples, other, historical, records, from, wazirs, amirs, and, the, court, historians, of, various, sultans, of, the, delhi, sultanate, describe, the, grandeur, of, idols, and, temples, they, witnessed, in, their, campaigns, and, how, these, were, destroyed, and, desecrated, in, 1193, the, nalanda, university, complex, was, destroyed, by, afghan, khalji, ghilzai, muslims, under, bakhtiyar, khalji, this, event, is, seen, as, the, final, milestone, in, the, decline, of, buddhism, in, india, he, also, burned, nalanda, s, major, buddhist, library, and, vikramshila, university, as, well, as, numerous, buddhist, monasteries, in, india, when, the, tibetan, translator, chag, lotsawa, dharmasvamin, chag, lo, tsa, ba, 1197, 1264, visited, northern, india, in, 1235, nalanda, was, damaged, looted, and, largely, deserted, but, still, standing, and, functioning, with, seventy, students, mahabodhi, sompura, vajrasan, and, other, important, monasteries, were, found, to, be, untouched, the, ghuri, ravages, only, afflicted, those, monasteries, that, lay, in, the, direct, path, of, their, advance, and, were, fortified, in, the, manner, of, defensive, forts, by, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, following, the, muslim, conquest, of, the, buddhist, stronghold, in, bihar, buddhism, having, already, declined, in, the, south, declined, in, the, north, as, well, because, survivors, retreated, to, nepal, sikkim, and, tibet, or, escaped, to, the, south, of, the, indian, sub, continent, the, martand, sun, temple, was, built, by, the, third, ruler, of, the, karkota, dynasty, lalitaditya, muktapida, in, the, 8th, century, ce, the, temple, was, completely, destroyed, on, the, orders, of, the, muslim, ruler, sikandar, butshikan, in, the, early, 15th, century, with, demolition, lasting, a, year, he, is, remembered, for, his, strenuous, efforts, to, convert, the, hindus, of, kashmir, to, islam, these, efforts, included, the, destruction, of, numerous, old, temples, prohibition, of, hindu, rites, and, rituals, and, even, the, wearing, of, clothes, in, the, hindu, style, the, city, flourished, between, the, 14th, century, and, 16th, century, during, the, height, of, the, vijayanagara, empire, during, this, time, it, was, often, in, conflict, with, the, kingdoms, which, rose, in, the, northern, deccan, and, which, are, often, collectively, termed, the, deccan, sultanates, the, vijaynagara, empire, successfully, resisted, muslim, invasions, for, centuries, but, in, 1565, the, empire, s, armies, suffered, a, massive, and, catastrophic, defeat, at, the, hands, of, an, alliance, of, the, sultanates, and, the, capital, was, taken, the, victorious, armies, then, razed, depopulated, and, destroyed, the, city, over, several, months, the, empire, continued, its, slow, decline, but, the, original, capital, was, not, reoccupied, or, rebuilt, around, 1024, ce, during, the, reign, of, bhima, i, mahmud, of, ghazni, raided, gujarat, and, plundered, the, somnath, temple, according, to, an, 1169, inscription, bhima, rebuilt, the, temple, this, inscription, does, not, mention, any, destruction, caused, by, mahmud, and, states, that, the, temple, had, decayed, due, to, time, in, 1299, alauddin, khalji, s, army, under, the, leadership, of, ulugh, khan, defeated, karandev, ii, of, the, vaghela, dynasty, and, sacked, the, somnath, temple, in, 1665, the, temple, was, once, again, ordered, to, be, destroyed, by, mughal, emperor, aurangzeb, in, 1702, he, ordered, that, if, hindus, had, revived, worship, there, it, should, be, demolished, completely
