mexican, cession, the, mexican, american, war, also, known, in, the, united, states, as, the, mexican, war, and, in, mexico, as, the, united, states, intervention, in, mexico, was, an, invasion, of, mexico, by, the, united, states, army, from, 1846, to, 1848, it, followed, the, 1845, american, annexation, of, texas, which, mexico, still, considered, its, territory, because, it, refused, to, recognize, the, treaties, of, velasco, signed, by, president, antonio, l, pez, de, santa, anna, after, he, was, captured, by, the, texian, army, during, the, 1836, texas, revolution, the, republic, of, texas, was, de, facto, an, independent, country, but, most, of, its, anglo, american, citizens, who, had, moved, from, the, united, states, to, texas, after, 1822, wanted, to, be, annexed, by, the, united, states, in, the, united, states, sectional, politics, over, slavery, had, previously, prevented, annexation, because, texas, formerly, a, slavery, free, territory, under, mexican, rule, would, have, been, admitted, as, a, slave, state, upsetting, the, balance, of, power, between, northern, free, states, and, southern, slave, states, in, the, 1844, united, states, presidential, election, democrat, james, k, polk, was, elected, on, a, platform, of, expanding, u, s, territory, to, oregon, california, also, a, mexican, territory, and, texas, by, any, means, with, the, 1845, annexation, of, texas, furthering, that, goal, however, the, boundary, between, texas, and, mexico, was, disputed, with, the, republic, of, texas, and, the, u, s, asserting, it, to, be, the, rio, grande, and, mexico, claiming, it, to, be, the, more, northern, nueces, river, polk, sent, a, diplomatic, mission, to, mexico, in, an, attempt, to, buy, the, disputed, territory, together, with, california, and, everything, in, between, for, 25, million, equivalent, to, 778, million, in, 2023, an, offer, the, mexican, government, refused, polk, then, sent, a, group, of, 80, soldiers, across, the, disputed, territory, to, the, rio, grande, ignoring, mexican, demands, to, withdraw, mexican, forces, interpreted, this, as, an, attack, and, repelled, the, u, s, forces, on, april, 25, 1846, a, move, which, polk, used, to, convince, the, congress, of, the, united, states, to, declare, war, beyond, the, disputed, area, of, texas, u, s, forces, quickly, occupied, the, regional, capital, of, santa, fe, de, nuevo, m, xico, along, the, upper, rio, grande, u, s, forces, also, moved, against, the, province, of, alta, california, and, then, turned, south, the, pacific, squadron, of, the, u, s, navy, blockaded, the, pacific, coast, in, the, lower, baja, california, territory, the, u, s, army, under, major, general, winfield, scott, invaded, the, mexican, heartland, and, captured, the, capital, mexico, city, in, september, 1847, although, mexico, was, defeated, on, the, battlefield, negotiating, peace, was, a, politically, fraught, issue, some, mexican, factions, refused, to, consider, any, recognition, of, its, loss, of, territory, although, polk, formally, relieved, his, peace, envoy, nicholas, trist, of, his, post, as, negotiator, trist, ignored, the, order, and, successfully, concluded, the, 1848, treaty, of, guadalupe, hidalgo, it, ended, the, war, and, mexico, recognized, the, cession, of, present, day, texas, california, nevada, and, utah, as, well, as, parts, of, present, day, arizona, colorado, new, mexico, and, wyoming, the, u, s, agreed, to, pay, 15, million, for, the, physical, damage, of, the, war, and, assumed, 3, 25, million, of, debt, already, owed, by, the, mexican, government, to, u, s, citizens, mexico, relinquished, its, claims, on, texas, and, accepted, the, rio, grande, as, its, northern, border, with, the, united, states, the, victory, and, territorial, expansion, polk, envisioned, inspired, patriotism, among, some, sections, of, the, united, states, but, the, war, and, treaty, drew, fierce, criticism, for, the, casualties, monetary, cost, and, heavy, handedness, the, question, of, how, to, treat, the, new, acquisitions, intensified, the, debate, over, slavery, in, the, united, states, although, the, wilmot, proviso, that, explicitly, forbade, the, extension, of, slavery, into, conquered, mexican, territory, was, not, adopted, by, congress, debates, about, it, heightened, sectional, tensions, some, scholars, see, the, mexican, american, war, as, leading, to, the, american, civil, war, many, officers, who, had, trained, at, west, point, gained, experience, in, the, war, in, mexico, and, later, played, prominent, leadership, roles, during, the, civil, war, in, mexico, the, war, worsened, domestic, political, turmoil, since, the, war, was, fought, on, home, ground, mexico, suffered, large, losses, of, life, from, both, the, military, and, civilian, population, the, nation, s, financial, foundations, were, undermined, and, more, than, half, of, its, territory, was, lost, mexico, felt, a, loss, of, national, prestige, leaving, it, in, what, a, group, of, mexican, writers, including, ram, n, alcaraz, and, jos, mar, a, del, castillo, velasco, called, a, state, of, degradation, and, ruin, the, true, origin, of, the, war, it, is, sufficient, to, say, that, the, insatiable, ambition, of, the, united, states, favored, by, our, weakness, caused, it, mexico, obtained, independence, from, the, spanish, empire, with, the, treaty, of, c, rdoba, in, 1821, after, a, decade, of, conflict, between, the, royal, army, and, insurgents, for, independence, with, no, foreign, intervention, the, conflict, ruined, the, silver, mining, districts, of, zacatecas, and, guanajuato, mexico, began, as, a, sovereign, nation, with, its, future, financial, stability, from, its, main, export, destroyed, mexico, briefly, experimented, with, monarchy, but, became, a, republic, in, 1824, this, government, was, characterized, by, instability, and, it, was, ill, prepared, for, a, major, international, conflict, when, war, broke, out, with, the, u, s, in, 1846, mexico, had, successfully, resisted, spanish, attempts, to, reconquer, its, former, colony, in, the, 1820s, and, resisted, the, french, in, the, so, called, pastry, war, of, 1838, but, the, secessionists, success, in, texas, and, the, yucat, n, against, the, centralist, government, of, mexico, showed, its, political, weakness, as, the, government, changed, hands, multiple, times, the, mexican, military, and, the, catholic, church, in, mexico, both, privileged, institutions, with, conservative, political, views, were, stronger, politically, than, the, mexican, state, the, united, states, 1803, louisiana, purchase, resulted, in, an, undefined, border, between, spanish, colonial, territories, and, the, u, s, some, of, the, boundary, issues, between, the, u, s, and, spain, were, resolved, with, the, adams, on, s, treaty, of, 1818, u, s, negotiator, john, quincy, adams, wanted, clear, possession, of, east, florida, and, establishment, of, u, s, claims, above, the, 42nd, parallel, while, spain, sought, to, limit, u, s, expansion, into, what, is, now, the, american, southwest, the, u, s, sought, to, purchase, territory, from, mexico, starting, in, 1825, in, order, to, settle, some, of, these, issues, u, s, president, andrew, jackson, made, a, sustained, effort, to, acquire, northern, mexican, territory, with, no, success, historian, peter, guardino, states, that, in, the, war, the, greatest, advantage, the, united, states, had, was, its, prosperity, with, the, industrial, revolution, across, the, atlantic, increasing, the, demand, for, cotton, for, textile, factories, there, was, a, large, external, market, for, cotton, produced, by, enslaved, african, american, labor, in, the, southern, states, this, demand, helped, fuel, expansion, into, northern, mexico, although, there, were, political, conflicts, in, the, u, s, they, were, largely, contained, by, the, framework, of, the, constitution, and, did, not, result, in, revolution, or, rebellion, by, 1846, but, rather, by, sectional, political, conflicts, northerners, in, the, u, s, sought, to, develop, the, country, s, existing, resources, and, expand, the, industrial, sector, without, expanding, the, nation, s, territory, the, existing, balance, of, sectional, interests, would, be, disrupted, by, the, expansion, of, slavery, into, new, territory, the, democratic, party, to, which, president, polk, belonged, in, particular, strongly, supported, expansion, neither, colonial, mexico, nor, the, newly, sovereign, mexican, state, effectively, controlled, mexico, s, far, north, and, west, mexico, s, military, and, diplomatic, capabilities, declined, after, it, attained, independence, from, spain, in, 1821, and, left, the, northern, half, of, the, country, vulnerable, to, attacks, by, comanche, apache, and, navajo, native, americans, the, comanche, in, particular, took, advantage, of, the, weakness, of, the, mexican, state, to, undertake, large, scale, raids, hundreds, of, miles, into, the, country, to, acquire, livestock, for, their, own, use, and, to, supply, an, expanding, market, in, texas, and, the, u, s, the, northern, area, of, mexico, was, sparsely, settled, because, of, its, challenging, climate, and, topography, mostly, high, desert, with, scarce, rainfall, it, supported, little, sedentary, agriculture, during, the, pre, hispanic, and, colonial, periods, after, independence, mexico, became, preoccupied, with, internal, struggles, that, sometimes, verged, on, civil, war, and, the, worsening, situation, on, the, northern, frontier, was, largely, neglected, in, northern, mexico, the, end, of, spanish, rule, was, marked, by, the, end, of, financing, for, garrisoned, presidios, and, the, pay, offs, to, native, americans, to, maintain, peace, in, the, absence, of, effective, governance, comanche, and, apache, took, to, raiding, for, livestock, and, looted, much, of, the, northern, countryside, outside, of, the, scattered, towns, the, raids, after, 1821, resulted, in, many, deaths, halted, most, transportation, and, communications, and, decimated, the, ranching, industry, that, was, a, mainstay, of, the, northern, economy, as, a, result, the, demoralized, civilian, population, of, northern, mexico, put, up, little, resistance, to, the, invading, u, s, army, furthermore, distance, and, hostile, activity, by, native, americans, made, communications, and, trade, between, the, heartland, of, mexico, and, provinces, such, as, alta, california, and, new, mexico, increasingly, difficult, as, a, result, at, the, outbreak, of, the, war, new, mexico, was, economically, dependent, on, trade, with, the, united, states, via, the, eastern, branch, of, the, santa, fe, trail, the, mexican, government, s, policy, of, allowing, the, settlement, of, u, s, citizens, in, its, province, of, tejas, was, aimed, at, expanding, control, into, comanche, lands, the, comancheria, however, rather, than, settling, in, the, dangerous, central, and, western, parts, of, the, province, anglos, preferred, to, settle, in, east, texas, with, its, rich, farmland, contiguous, with, the, southern, u, s, slave, states, as, settlers, poured, in, from, the, u, s, the, mexican, government, discouraged, further, migration, with, its, 1829, abolition, of, slavery, during, the, spanish, colonial, era, the, californias, i, e, the, baja, california, peninsula, and, alta, california, were, sparsely, settled, after, mexico, became, independent, it, shut, down, the, missions, and, reduced, its, military, presence, in, 1842, the, u, s, minister, in, mexico, waddy, thompson, jr, suggested, mexico, might, be, willing, to, cede, alta, california, to, the, u, s, to, settle, debts, saying, as, to, texas, i, regard, it, as, of, very, little, value, compared, with, california, the, richest, the, most, beautiful, and, the, healthiest, country, in, the, world, with, the, acquisition, of, upper, california, we, should, have, the, same, ascendency, on, the, pacific, france, and, england, both, have, had, their, eyes, upon, it, u, s, president, john, tyler, s, administration, suggested, a, tripartite, pact, to, settle, the, oregon, boundary, dispute, and, provide, for, the, cession, of, the, port, of, san, francisco, from, mexico, lord, aberdeen, declined, to, participate, but, said, britain, had, no, objection, to, u, s, territorial, acquisition, there, the, british, minister, in, mexico, richard, pakenham, wrote, in, 1841, to, lord, palmerston, urging, to, establish, an, english, population, in, the, magnificent, territory, of, upper, california, saying, that, no, part, of, the, world, offering, greater, natural, advantages, for, the, establishment, of, an, english, colony, by, all, means, desirable, that, california, once, ceasing, to, belong, to, mexico, should, not, fall, into, the, hands, of, any, power, but, england, there, is, some, reason, to, believe, that, daring, and, adventurous, speculators, in, the, united, states, have, already, turned, their, thoughts, in, this, direction, by, the, time, the, letter, reached, london, though, sir, robert, peel, s, tory, government, with, its, little, england, policy, had, come, to, power, and, rejected, the, proposal, as, expensive, and, a, potential, source, of, conflict, p, o, pico, the, last, governor, of, alta, california, advocated, that, california, achieve, independence, from, mexico, and, become, a, british, protectorate, in, 1842, mexico, forcibly, replaced, california, governor, juan, bautista, alvarado, with, manuel, micheltorena, micheltorena, was, sent, up, from, lower, mexico, along, with, an, army, that, had, largely, been, recruited, from, mexico, s, worst, jails, the, californios, resented, this, partly, because, california, had, previously, been, governed, by, native, born, californios, partly, because, micheltorena, s, policies, were, unpopular, and, also, because, the, soldiers, in, micheltorena, s, army, got, a, reputation, for, spending, much, of, their, time, stealing, the, local, californios, chickens, women, were, not, considered, safe, from, the, depredations, of, micheltorena, s, army, former, governor, alvarado, organized, a, revolt, in, 1845, which, culminated, in, the, battle, of, providencia, in, cahuenga, pass, near, los, angeles, as, a, result, of, the, actions, of, pioneer, california, rancher, john, marsh, micheltorena, s, forces, were, defeated, in, 1800, spain, s, colonial, province, of, texas, tejas, had, few, inhabitants, with, only, about, 7, 000, non, native, settlers, the, spanish, crown, developed, a, policy, of, colonization, to, more, effectively, control, the, territory, after, independence, the, mexican, government, implemented, the, policy, granting, moses, austin, a, banker, from, missouri, a, large, tract, of, land, in, texas, austin, died, before, he, could, bring, his, plan, of, recruiting, american, settlers, for, the, land, to, fruition, but, his, son, stephen, f, austin, brought, over, 300, american, families, into, texas, this, started, the, steady, trend, of, migration, from, the, united, states, into, the, texas, frontier, austin, s, colony, was, the, most, successful, of, several, colonies, authorized, by, the, mexican, government, the, mexican, government, intended, the, new, settlers, to, act, as, a, buffer, between, the, tejano, residents, and, the, comanches, but, the, non, hispanic, colonists, tended, to, settle, in, areas, with, decent, farmland, and, trade, connections, with, louisiana, rather, than, farther, west, where, they, would, have, been, an, effective, buffer, against, the, natives, in, 1829, because, of, the, large, influx, of, american, immigrants, the, non, hispanic, outnumbered, native, spanish, speakers, in, texas, president, vicente, guerrero, a, hero, of, mexican, independence, moved, to, gain, more, control, over, texas, and, its, influx, of, non, hispanic, colonists, from, the, southern, u, s, and, discourage, further, immigration, by, abolishing, slavery, in, mexico, the, mexican, government, also, decided, to, reinstate, the, property, tax, and, increase, tariffs, on, shipped, american, goods, the, settlers, and, many, mexican, businessmen, in, the, region, rejected, the, demands, which, led, to, mexico, closing, texas, to, additional, immigration, which, continued, from, the, united, states, into, texas, illegally, in, 1834, mexican, conservatives, seized, the, political, initiative, and, general, antonio, l, pez, de, santa, anna, became, the, centralist, president, of, mexico, the, conservative, dominated, congress, abandoned, the, federal, system, replacing, it, with, a, unitary, central, government, that, removed, power, from, the, states, leaving, politics, to, those, in, mexico, city, general, santa, anna, led, the, mexican, army, to, quash, the, semi, independence, of, texas, he, had, done, that, in, coahuila, in, 1824, mexico, had, merged, texas, and, coahuila, into, the, enormous, state, of, coahuila, y, tejas, austin, called, texians, to, arms, and, they, declared, independence, from, mexico, in, 1836, after, santa, anna, defeated, the, texians, in, the, battle, of, the, alamo, he, was, defeated, by, the, texian, army, commanded, by, general, sam, houston, and, was, captured, at, the, battle, of, san, jacinto, in, exchange, for, his, life, santa, anna, signed, a, treaty, with, texas, president, david, burnet, ending, the, war, and, recognizing, texian, independence, the, treaty, was, not, ratified, by, the, mexican, congress, as, it, had, been, signed, by, a, captive, under, duress, although, mexico, refused, to, recognize, texian, independence, texas, consolidated, its, status, as, an, independent, republic, and, received, official, recognition, from, britain, france, and, the, united, states, which, all, advised, mexico, not, to, try, to, reconquer, the, new, nation, most, texians, wanted, to, join, the, united, states, but, the, annexation, of, texas, was, contentious, in, the, u, s, congress, where, whigs, and, abolitionists, were, largely, opposed, 150, 155, in, 1845, texas, agreed, to, the, offer, of, annexation, by, the, u, s, congress, and, became, the, 28th, state, on, december, 29, 1845, which, set, the, stage, for, the, conflict, with, mexico, by, the, treaties, of, velasco, made, after, texans, captured, general, santa, ana, after, the, battle, of, san, jacinto, the, southern, border, of, texas, was, placed, at, the, rio, grande, del, norte, the, texans, claimed, this, placed, the, southern, border, at, the, modern, rio, grande, the, mexican, government, disputed, this, placement, on, two, grounds, first, it, rejected, the, idea, of, texas, independence, and, second, it, claimed, that, the, rio, grande, in, the, treaty, was, actually, the, nueces, river, since, the, current, rio, grande, has, always, been, called, rio, bravo, in, mexico, the, latter, claim, belied, the, full, name, of, the, river, in, mexico, however, rio, bravo, del, norte, the, ill, fated, texan, santa, fe, expedition, of, 1841, attempted, to, realize, the, claim, to, new, mexican, territory, east, of, the, rio, grande, but, its, members, were, captured, by, the, mexican, army, and, imprisoned, reference, to, the, rio, grande, boundary, of, texas, was, omitted, from, the, u, s, congress, s, annexation, resolution, to, help, secure, passage, after, the, annexation, treaty, failed, in, the, senate, president, polk, claimed, the, rio, grande, boundary, and, when, mexico, sent, forces, over, the, rio, grande, this, provoked, a, dispute, in, july, 1845, polk, sent, general, zachary, taylor, to, texas, and, by, october, taylor, commanded, 3, 500, americans, on, the, nueces, river, ready, to, take, by, force, the, disputed, land, at, the, same, time, president, polk, wrote, to, the, american, consul, in, the, mexican, territory, of, alta, california, disclaiming, american, ambitions, in, california, but, offering, to, support, independence, from, mexico, or, voluntary, accession, to, the, united, states, and, warning, that, the, united, states, would, oppose, any, european, attempts, to, take, over, to, end, another, war, scare, with, the, united, kingdom, over, the, oregon, country, polk, signed, the, oregon, treaty, dividing, the, territory, angering, northern, democrats, who, felt, he, was, prioritizing, southern, expansion, over, northern, expansion, in, the, winter, of, 1845, 46, the, federally, commissioned, explorer, john, c, fr, mont, and, a, group, of, armed, men, appeared, in, alta, california, after, telling, both, the, mexican, governor, and, the, american, consul, thomas, o, larkin, that, he, was, merely, buying, supplies, on, the, way, to, oregon, he, instead, went, to, the, populated, area, of, california, and, visited, santa, cruz, and, the, salinas, valley, explaining, he, had, been, looking, for, a, seaside, home, for, his, mother, mexican, authorities, became, alarmed, and, ordered, him, to, leave, fr, mont, responded, by, building, a, fort, on, gavilan, peak, and, raising, the, american, flag, larkin, sent, word, that, fr, mont, s, actions, were, counterproductive, fr, mont, left, california, in, march, but, returned, and, took, control, of, the, california, battalion, following, the, outbreak, of, the, bear, flag, revolt, in, sonoma, in, november, 1845, polk, sent, john, slidell, a, secret, representative, to, mexico, city, with, an, offer, to, the, mexican, government, of, 25, million, for, the, rio, grande, border, in, texas, and, mexico, s, provinces, of, alta, california, and, santa, fe, de, nuevo, m, xico, u, s, expansionists, wanted, california, to, thwart, any, british, interests, in, the, area, and, to, gain, a, port, on, the, pacific, ocean, polk, authorized, slidell, to, forgive, the, 3, million, owed, to, u, s, citizens, for, damages, caused, by, the, mexican, war, of, independence, and, pay, another, 25, to, 30, million, for, the, two, territories, mexico, was, neither, inclined, nor, able, to, negotiate, in, 1846, alone, the, presidency, changed, hands, four, times, the, war, ministry, six, times, and, the, finance, ministry, sixteen, times, despite, that, mexican, public, opinion, and, all, political, factions, agreed, that, selling, the, territories, to, the, united, states, would, tarnish, the, national, honor, mexicans, who, opposed, direct, conflict, with, the, united, states, including, president, jos, joaqu, n, de, herrera, were, viewed, as, traitors, military, opponents, of, de, herrera, supported, by, populist, newspapers, considered, slidell, s, presence, in, mexico, city, an, insult, when, de, herrera, considered, receiving, slidell, to, settle, the, problem, of, texas, annexation, peacefully, he, was, accused, of, treason, and, deposed, after, a, more, nationalistic, government, under, general, mariano, paredes, y, arrillaga, came, to, power, it, publicly, reaffirmed, mexico, s, claim, to, texas, the, mexican, army, was, a, weak, and, divided, force, only, 7, of, the, 19, states, that, formed, the, mexican, federation, sent, soldiers, armament, and, money, for, the, war, effort, many, leaders, expressed, their, concern, for, the, country, including, santa, anna, who, stated, that, the, leaders, of, the, army, did, their, best, to, train, the, rough, men, who, volunteered, but, they, could, do, little, to, inspire, them, with, patriotism, for, the, glorious, country, they, were, honored, to, serve, according, to, the, leading, mexican, conservative, politician, lucas, alam, n, the, money, spent, on, arming, mexican, troops, merely, enabled, them, to, fight, each, other, and, give, the, illusion, that, the, country, possessed, an, army, for, its, defense, however, an, officer, criticized, santa, anna, s, training, of, troops, the, cavalry, was, drilled, only, in, regiments, the, artillery, hardly, ever, maneuvered, and, never, fired, a, blank, shot, the, general, in, command, was, never, present, on, the, field, of, maneuvers, so, that, he, was, unable, to, appreciate, the, respective, qualities, of, the, various, bodies, under, his, command, if, any, meetings, of, the, principal, commanding, officers, were, held, to, discuss, the, operations, of, the, campaign, it, was, not, known, nor, was, it, known, whether, any, plan, of, campaign, had, been, formed, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, mexican, forces, were, divided, between, the, permanent, forces, permanentes, and, the, active, militiamen, activos, the, permanent, forces, consisted, of, 12, regiments, of, infantry, of, two, battalions, each, three, brigades, of, artillery, eight, regiments, of, cavalry, one, separate, squadron, and, a, brigade, of, dragoons, the, militia, amounted, to, nine, infantry, and, six, cavalry, regiments, in, the, northern, territories, presidial, companies, presidiales, protected, the, scattered, settlements, indigenous, populations, in, mexico, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, defending, their, land, by, the, beginning, of, the, war, indigenous, populations, were, depleted, of, their, natural, resources, due, to, an, influx, of, american, settlers, as, a, result, indigenous, populations, from, the, great, plains, region, had, to, rely, on, raiding, american, camps, in, order, to, survive, although, raiding, was, much, more, lucrative, than, hunting, indigenous, population, did, not, have, much, of, a, choice, indigenous, soldiers, who, volunteered, to, fight, with, the, mexican, army, were, often, abandoned, and, compensated, unfairly, by, raiding, indigenous, populations, were, also, able, to, acquire, horses, and, properly, tame, them, to, move, efficiently, during, battles, captive, taking, methods, especially, that, of, the, comanche, tribe, were, also, used, to, the, advantage, of, the, mexican, army, as, captives, would, end, up, assisting, indigenous, populations, in, the, raids, of, american, forces, the, mexican, army, was, using, surplus, british, muskets, such, as, the, brown, bess, left, over, from, the, napoleonic, wars, while, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, most, american, soldiers, were, still, equipped, with, the, very, similar, springfield, 1816, flintlock, muskets, more, reliable, caplock, models, became, increasingly, popular, as, the, conflict, progressed, some, u, s, troops, carried, more, modern, weapons, that, gave, them, a, significant, advantage, over, their, mexican, counterparts, such, as, the, springfield, 1841, rifle, of, the, mississippi, rifles, and, the, colt, paterson, revolver, of, the, texas, rangers, in, the, later, stages, of, the, war, the, u, s, mounted, rifles, were, issued, colt, walker, revolvers, of, which, the, u, s, army, had, ordered, 1, 000, in, 1846, most, significantly, throughout, the, war,

when, wanted, his, consent, was, not, asked, he, was, poorly, clothed, worse, fed, and, seldom, paid, he, was, turned, adrift, when, no, longer, wanted, the, officers, of, the, lower, grades, were, but, little, superior, to, the, men, with, all, this, i, have, seen, as, brave, stands, made, by, some, of, these, men, as, i, have, ever, seen, made, by, soldiers, now, mexico, has, a, standing, army, larger, than, the, united, states, they, have, a, military, school, modeled, after, west, point, their, officers, are, educated, and, no, doubt, very, brave, the, mexican, war, of, 1846, 48, would, be, an, impossibility, in, this, generation, there, were, significant, political, divisions, in, mexico, which, seriously, impeded, the, war, effort, inside, mexico, the, conservative, centralistas, and, liberal, federalists, vied, for, power, and, at, times, these, two, factions, inside, mexico, s, military, fought, each, other, rather, than, the, invading, u, s, army, santa, anna, bitterly, remarked, however, shameful, it, may, be, to, admit, this, we, have, brought, this, disgraceful, tragedy, upon, ourselves, through, our, interminable, in, fighting, during, the, conflict, presidents, held, office, for, a, period, of, months, sometimes, just, weeks, or, even, days, just, before, the, outbreak, of, the, war, liberal, general, jos, joaqu, n, de, herrera, was, president, december, 1844, december, 1845, and, willing, to, engage, in, talks, so, long, as, he, did, not, appear, to, be, caving, to, the, u, s, but, he, was, accused, by, many, mexican, factions, of, selling, out, his, country, vendepatria, for, considering, it, he, was, overthrown, by, conservative, mariano, paredes, december, 1845, july, 1846, who, left, the, presidency, to, fight, the, invading, u, s, army, and, was, replaced, by, his, vice, president, nicol, s, bravo, july, 28, 1846, august, 4, 1846, the, conservative, bravo, was, overthrown, by, federalist, liberals, who, re, established, the, federal, constitution, of, 1824, jos, mariano, salas, august, 6, 1846, december, 23, 1846, served, as, president, and, held, elections, under, the, restored, federalist, system, general, antonio, l,

the, political, mess, santa, anna, briefly, held, the, presidency, again, from, march, 21, 1847, april, 2, 1847, his, troops, were, deprived, of, support, that, would, allow, them, to, continue, the, fight, the, conservatives, demanded, the, removal, of, g, mez, far, as, and, this, was, accomplished, by, abolishing, the, office, of, vice, president, santa, anna, returned, to, the, field, replaced, in, the, presidency, by, pedro, mar, a, de, anaya, april, 2, may, 20, 1847, santa, anna, returned, to, the, presidency, on, may, 20, 1847, when, anaya, left, to, fight, the, invasion, serving, until, september, 15, 1847, preferring, the, battlefield, to, administration, santa, anna, left, office, again, leaving, the, office, to, manuel, de, la, pe, a, y, pe, a, september, 16, november, 13, 1847, with, u, s, forces, occupying, the, mexican, capital, and, much, of, the, heartland, negotiating, a, peace, treaty, was, an, exigent, matter, and, pe, a, y, pe, a, left, office, to, do, that, pedro, mar, a, anaya, returned, to, the, presidency, on, november, 13, 1847, january, 8, 1848, anaya, refused, to, sign, any, treaty, that, ceded, land, to, the, u, s, despite, the, situation, on, the, ground, with, americans, occupying, the, capital, pe, a, y, pe, a, resumed, the, presidency, january, 8, 1848, june, 3, 1848, during, which, time, the, treaty, of, guadalupe, hidalgo, was, signed, bringing, the, war, to, an, end, polk, had, pledged, to, seek, expanded, territory, in, oregon, and, texas, as, part, of, his, campaign, in, 1844, but, the, regular, army, was, not, sufficiently, large, to, sustain, extended, conflicts, on, two, fronts, the, oregon, dispute, with, britain, was, settled, peaceably, by, treaty, allowing, u, s, forces, to, concentrate, on, the, southern, border, the, war, was, fought, by, regiments, of, regulars, bolstered, by, various, regiments, battalions, and, companies, of, volunteers, from, the, different, states, of, the, union, as, well, as, americans, and, some, mexicans, in, california, and, new, mexico, in, general, the, regular, army, officers, looked, down, on, the, volunteers, whose, training, was, poor, and, whose, behavior, was, undisciplined, see, below, on, the, west, coast, the, u, s, navy, fielded, a, battalion, of, sailors, in, an, attempt, to, recapture, los, angeles, although, the, u, s, army, and, navy, were, not, large, at, the, outbreak, of, the, war, the, officers, were, generally, well, trained, and, the, numbers, of, enlisted, men, fairly, large, compared, to, mexico, s, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, the, u, s, army, had, eight, regiments, of, infantry, three, battalions, each, four, artillery, regiments, and, three, mounted, regiments, two, dragoons, one, of, mounted, rifles, these, regiments, were, supplemented, by, 10, new, regiments, nine, of, infantry, and, one, of, cavalry, raised, for, one, year, of, service, by, the, act, of, congress, from, february, 11, 1847, a, large, portion, of, this, fighting, force, consisted, of, recent, immigrants, according, to, tyler, v, johnson, foreign, born, men, amounted, to, 47, percent, of, general, taylor, s, total, forces, in, addition, to, a, large, contingent, of, irish, and, german, born, soldiers, nearly, all, european, states, and, principalities, were, represented, it, is, estimated, that, the, u, s, army, further, included, 1, 500, men, from, british, north, america, including, french, canadians, although, polk, hoped, to, avoid, a, protracted, war, over, texas, the, extended, conflict, stretched, regular, army, resources, necessitating, the, recruitment, of, volunteers, with, short, term, enlistments, some, enlistments, were, for, a, year, but, others, were, for, 3, or, 6, months, the, best, volunteers, signed, up, for, a, year, s, service, in, the, summer, of, 1846, with, their, enlistments, expiring, just, when, general, winfield, scott, s, campaign, was, poised, to, capture, mexico, city, many, did, not, re, enlist, deciding, that, they, would, rather, return, home, than, place, themselves, in, harm, s, way, of, disease, threat, of, death, or, injury, on, the, battlefield, or, in, guerrilla, warfare, their, patriotism, was, doubted, by, some, in, the, u, s, but, they, were, not, counted, as, deserters, the, volunteers, were, far, less, disciplined, than, the, regular, army, with, many, committing, attacks, on, the, civilian, population, sometimes, stemming, from, anti, catholic, and, anti, mexican, racial, bias, soldiers, memoirs, describe, cases, of, looting, and, murder, of, mexican, civilians, mostly, by, volunteers, one, officer, s, diary, records, we, reached, burrita, about, 5, pm, many, of, the, louisiana, volunteers, were, there, a, lawless, drunken, rabble, they, had, driven, away, the, inhabitants, taken, possession, of, their, houses, and, were, emulating, each, other, in, making, beasts, of, themselves, john, l, o, sullivan, a, vocal, proponent, of, manifest, destiny, later, recalled, the, regulars, regarded, the, volunteers, with, importance, and, contempt, robbed, mexicans, of, their, cattle, and, corn, stole, their, fences, for, firewood, got, drunk, and, killed, several, inoffensive, inhabitants, of, the, town, in, the, streets, many, of, the, volunteers, were, unwanted, and, considered, poor, soldiers, the, expression, just, like, gaines, s, army, came, to, refer, to, something, useless, the, phrase, having, originated, when, a, group, of, untrained, and, unwilling, louisiana, troops, was, rejected, and, sent, back, by, general, taylor, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, in, his, 1885, memoirs, ulysses, grant, assesses, the, u, s, armed, forces, facing, mexico, more, favorably, the, victories, in, mexico, were, in, every, instance, over, vastly, superior, numbers, there, were, two, reasons, for, this, both, general, scott, and, general, taylor, had, such, armies, as, are, not, often, got, together, at, the, battles, of, palo, alto, and, resaca, de, la, palma, general, taylor, had, a, small, army, but, it, was, composed, exclusively, of, regular, troops, under, the, best, of, drill, and, discipline, every, officer, from, the, highest, to, the, lowest, was, educated, in, his, profession, not, at, west, point, necessarily, but, in, the, camp, in, garrison, and, many, of, them, in, wars, with, natives, the, rank, and, file, were, probably, inferior, as, material, out, of, which, to, make, an, army, to, the, volunteers, that, participated, in, all, the, later, battles, of, the, war, but, they, were, brave, men, and, then, drill, and, discipline, brought, out, all, there, was, in, them, a, better, army, man, for, man, probably, never, faced, an, enemy, than, the, one, commanded, by, general, taylor, in, the, earliest, two, engagements, of, the, mexican, war, the, volunteers, who, followed, were, of, better, material, but, without, drill, or, discipline, at, the, start, they, were, associated, with, so, many, disciplined, men, and, professionally, educated, officers, that, when, they, went, into, engagements, it, was, with, a, confidence, they, would, not, have, felt, otherwise, they, became, soldiers, themselves, almost, at, once, all, these, conditions, we, would, enjoy, again, in, case, of, war, the, u, s, had, been, an, independent, country, since, the, american, revolution, but, it, was, a, country, that, was, strongly, divided, along, sectional, lines, especially, in, regard, to, slavery, enlarging, the, country, particularly, through, armed, combat, against, a, sovereign, nation, deepened, those, sectional, divisions, polk, had, narrowly, won, the, popular, vote, in, the, 1844, presidential, election, and, decisively, won, the, electoral, college, but, with, the, annexation, of, texas, in, 1845, and, the, outbreak, of, war, in, 1846, polk, s, democrats, lost, the, house, of, representatives, to, the, whig, party, which, opposed, the, war, unlike, mexico, which, had, weak, formal, state, institutions, chaotic, changes, in, government, and, a, military, that, regularly, intervened, in, politics, the, u, s, generally, kept, its, political, divisions, within, the, bounds, of, the, institutions, of, governance, since, mexico, fought, the, war, on, its, home, territory, a, traditional, support, system, for, troops, were, women, known, as, soldaderas, they, did, not, participate, in, conventional, fighting, on, battlefields, but, some, soldaderas, joined, the, battle, alongside, the, men, these, women, were, involved, in, fighting, during, the, defense, of, mexico, city, and, monterrey, some, women, such, as, do, a, jes, s, dosamantes, and, mar, a, josefa, zozaya, would, be, remembered, as, heroes, on, the, other, hand, some, mexican, women, were, seen, as, angels, as, they, provided, aid, and, comfort, to, the, injured, men, on, both, sides, although, soldaderas, were, able, to, prove, the, abilities, mexican, women, had, outside, of, the, private, sphere, mexican, women, on, the, home, front, still, contributed, to, the, war, effort, after, having, to, face, the, losses, in, their, country, mexican, women, were, seen, dressed, in, black, and, creating, somber, paintings, american, and, mexican, women, shared, the, similarities, of, providing, their, domestic, services, on, the, battlefield, among, the, most, notable, american, women, on, the, battlefield, was, sarah, bowman, she, was, often, seen, delivering, food, carrying, wounded, soldiers, and, in, close, combat, in, mexico, while, their, husbands, enlisted, many, american, women, stayed, in, mexico, to, tend, to, oversee, their, business, making, themselves, factory, women, however, factory, woman, ann, chase, was, willing, enough, to, become, a, spy, for, u, s, forces, in, order, to, protect, her, home, and, business, in, the, absence, of, her, husband, in, the, u, s, similarly, to, the, mexican, women, were, contributed, to, the, war, efforts, from, their, homes, women, in, the, u, s, also, protested, publicly, and, made, patriotic, crafts, that, u, s, soldiers, could, carry, in, addition, female, journalists, across, multiple, states, took, advantage, of, their, literacy, to, speak, up, in, support, or, in, opposition, of, the, war, including, anne, royall, jane, swisshelm, and, jane, cazneau, female, american, journalists, played, a, crucial, role, in, representing, the, voices, of, women, that, had, been, silenced, within, the, public, sphere, president, polk, ordered, general, taylor, and, his, forces, south, to, the, rio, grande, taylor, ignored, mexican, demands, to, withdraw, to, the, nueces, he, constructed, a, makeshift, fort, later, known, as, fort, brown, fort, texas, on, the, banks, of, the, rio, grande, opposite, the, city, of, matamoros, tamaulipas, the, mexican, forces, prepared, for, war, on, april, 25, 1846, a, 2, 000, man, mexican, cavalry, detachment, attacked, a, 70, man, u, s, patrol, commanded, by, captain, seth, thornton, which, had, been, sent, into, the, contested, territory, north, of, the, rio, grande, and, south, of, the, nueces, river, in, the, thornton, affair, the, mexican, cavalry, routed, the, patrol, killing, 11, american, soldiers, and, capturing, 52, a, few, days, after, the, thornton, affair, the, siege, of, fort, texas, began, on, may, 3, 1846, mexican, artillery, at, matamoros, opened, fire, on, fort, texas, which, replied, with, its, own, guns, the, bombardment, continued, for, 160, hours, and, expanded, as, mexican, forces, gradually, surrounded, the, fort, thirteen, u, s, soldiers, were, injured, during, the, bombardment, and, two, were, killed, among, the, dead, was, jacob, brown, after, whom, the, fort, was, later, named, on, may, 8, 1846, zachary, taylor, and, 2, 400, troops, arrived, to, relieve, the, fort, however, general, arista, rushed, north, with, a, force, of, 3, 400, and, intercepted, him, about, 5, miles, 8, km, north, of, the, rio, grande, river, near, modern, day, brownsville, texas, the, u, s, army, employed, flying, artillery, their, term, for, horse, artillery, a, mobile, light, artillery, mounted, on, horse, carriages, with, the, entire, crew, riding, horses, into, battle, the, fast, firing, artillery, and, highly, mobile, fire, support, had, a, devastating, effect, on, the, mexican, army, in, contrast, to, the, flying, artillery, of, the, americans, the, mexican, cannons, at, the, battle, of, palo, alto, had, lower, quality, gunpowder, that, fired, at, velocities, slow, enough, to, make, it, possible, for, american, soldiers, to, dodge, artillery, rounds, the, mexicans, replied, with, cavalry, skirmishes, and, their, own, artillery, the, u, s, flying, artillery, somewhat, demoralized, the, mexican, side, and, seeking, terrain, more, to, their, advantage, the, mexicans, retreated, to, the, far, side, of, a, dry, riverbed, resaca, during, the, night, and, prepared, for, the, next, battle, it, provided, a, natural, fortification, but, during, the, retreat, mexican, troops, were, scattered, making, communication, difficult, during, the, battle, of, resaca, de, la, palma, on, may, 9, 1846, the, two, sides, engaged, in, fierce, hand, to, hand, combat, the, u, s, cavalry, managed, to, capture, the, mexican, artillery, causing, the, mexican, side, to, retreat, a, retreat, that, turned, into, a, rout, fighting, on, unfamiliar, terrain, his, troops, fleeing, in, retreat, arista, found, it, impossible, to, rally, his, forces, mexican, casualties, were, significant, and, the, mexicans, were, forced, to, abandon, their, artillery, and, baggage, fort, brown, inflicted, additional, casualties, as, the, withdrawing, troops, passed, by, the, fort, and, additional, mexican, soldiers, drowned, trying, to, swim, across, the, rio, grande, taylor, crossed, the, rio, grande, and, began, his, series, of, battles, in, mexican, territory, polk, received, word, of, the, thornton, affair, which, added, to, the, mexican, government, s, rejection, of, slidell, polk, believed, constituted, a, casus, belli, polk, said, in, a, message, to, congress, the, cup, of, forbearance, had, been, exhausted, even, before, the, recent, information, from, the, frontier, of, the, del, norte, but, now, after, reiterated, menaces, mexico, has, passed, the, boundary, of, the, united, states, has, invaded, our, territory, and, shed, american, blood, upon, the, american, soil, she, has, proclaimed, that, hostilities, have, commenced, and, that, the, two, nations, are, now, at, war, the, u, s, congress, approved, the, declaration, of, war, on, may, 13, 1846, after, a, few, hours, of, debate, with, southern, democrats, in, strong, support, sixty, seven, whigs, voted, against, the, war, on, a, key, slavery, amendment, but, on, the, final, passage, only, fourteen, whigs, voted, no, including, john, quincy, adams, later, a, freshman, whig, congressman, from, illinois, abraham, lincoln, challenged, polk, s, assertion, that, american, blood, had, been, shed, on, american, soil, calling, it, a, bold, falsification, of, history, regarding, the, beginning, of, the, war, ulysses, s, grant, who, had, opposed, the, war, but, served, as, an, army, lieutenant, in, taylor, s, army, claims, in, his, personal, memoirs, 1885, that, the, main, goal, of, the, u, s, army, s, advance, from, nueces, river, to, the, rio, grande, was, to, provoke, the, outbreak, of, war, without, attacking, first, to, debilitate, any, political, opposition, to, the, war, the, presence, of, united, states, troops, on, the, edge, of, the, disputed, territory, farthest, from, the, mexican, settlements, was, not, sufficient, to, provoke, hostilities, we, were, sent, to, provoke, a, fight, but, it, was, essential, that, mexico, should, commence, it, it, was, very, doubtful, whether, congress, would, declare, war, but, if, mexico, should, attack, our, troops, the, executive, could, announce, whereas, war, exists, by, the, acts, of, etc, and, prosecute, the, contest, with, vigor, once, initiated, there, were, but, few, public, men, who, would, have, the, courage, to, oppose, it, mexico, showing, no, willingness, to, come, to, the, nueces, to, drive, the, invaders, from, her, soil, it, became, necessary, for, the, invaders, to, approach, to, within, a, convenient, distance, to, be, struck, accordingly, preparations, were, begun, for, moving, the, army, to, the, rio, grande, to, a, point, near, matamoras, it, was, desirable, to, occupy, a, position, near, the, largest, centre, of, population, possible, to, reach, without, absolutely, invading, territory, to, which, we, set, up, no, claim, whatever, in, mexico, although, paredes, issued, a, manifesto, on, may, 23, 1846, and, a, declaration, of, a, defensive, war, on, april, 23, both, of, which, are, considered, by, some, the, de, facto, start, of, the, war, the, mexican, congress, officially, declared, war, on, july, 7, 1846, 148, mexico, s, defeats, at, palo, alto, and, resaca, de, la, palma, set, the, stage, for, the, return, of, santa, anna, who, at, the, outbreak, of, the, war, was, in, exile, in, cuba, he, wrote, to, the, government, in, mexico, city, stating, he, did, not, want, to, return, to, the, presidency, but, he, would, like, to, come, out, of, exile, in, cuba, to, use, his, military, experience, to, reclaim, texas, for, mexico, president, far, as, was, driven, to, desperation, he, accepted, the, offer, and, allowed, santa, anna, to, return, unbeknownst, to, far, as, santa, anna, had, secretly, been, dealing, with, u, s, representatives, to, discuss, a, sale, of, all, contested, territory, to, the, u, s, at, a, reasonable, price, on, the, condition, that, he, be, allowed, back, in, mexico, through, the, u, s, naval, blockades, polk, sent, his, own, representative, to, cuba, alexander, slidell, mackenzie, to, negotiate, directly, with, santa, anna, the, negotiations, were, secret, and, there, are, no, written, records, of, the, meetings, but, there, was, some, understanding, that, came, out, of, the, meetings, polk, asked, congress, for, 2, million, to, be, used, in, negotiating, a, treaty, with, mexico, the, u, s, allowed, santa, anna, to, return, to, mexico, lifting, the, gulf, coast, naval, blockade, however, in, mexico, santa, anna, denied, all, knowledge, of, meeting, with, the, u, s, representative, or, any, offers, or, transactions, rather, than, being, polk, s, ally, he, pocketed, any, money, given, him, and, began, to, plan, the, defense, of, mexico, the, americans, were, dismayed, including, general, scott, as, this, was, an, unexpected, result, santa, anna, gloated, over, his, enemies, na, vet, the, united, states, was, deceived, in, believing, that, i, would, be, capable, of, betraying, my, mother, country, santa, anna, avoided, getting, involved, in, politics, dedicating, himself, to, mexico, s, military, defense, while, politicians, attempted, to, reset, the, governing, framework, to, a, federal, republic, santa, anna, left, for, the, front, to, retake, lost, northern, territory, although, santa, anna, was, elected, president, in, 1846, he, refused, to, govern, leaving, that, to, his, vice, president, while, he, sought, to, engage, with, taylor, s, forces, with, the, restored, federal, republic, some, states, refused, to, support, the, national, military, campaign, led, by, santa, anna, who, had, fought, with, them, directly, in, the, previous, decade, santa, anna, urged, vice, president, g, mez, far, as, to, act, as, a, dictator, to, get, the, men, and, materiel, needed, for, the, war, g, mez, far, as, forced, a, loan, from, the, catholic, church, but, the, funds, were, not, available, in, time, to, support, santa, anna, s, army, in, the, united, states, increasingly, divided, by, sectional, rivalry, the, war, was, a, partisan, issue, and, an, essential, element, in, the, origins, of, the, american, civil, war, most, whigs, in, the, north, and, south, opposed, it, most, democrats, supported, it, southern, democrats, animated, by, a, popular, belief, in, manifest, destiny, supported, it, in, the, hope, of, adding, slave, owning, territory, to, the, south, and, avoiding, being, outnumbered, by, the, faster, growing, north, o, sullivan, editor, of, the, democratic, review, coined, this, phrase, in, its, context, stating, that, it, must, be, our, manifest, destiny, to, overspread, the, continent, allotted, by, providence, for, the, free, development, of, our, yearly, multiplying, millions, northern, antislavery, elements, feared, the, expansion, of, the, southern, slave, power, whigs, generally, wanted, to, strengthen, the, economy, with, industrialization, not, expand, it, with, more, land, among, the, most, vocal, in, opposition, to, the, war, in, the, house, of, representatives, was, former, u, s, president, adams, of, massachusetts, he, had, first, voiced, concerns, about, expanding, into, mexican, territory, in, 1836, when, he, opposed, texas, s, annexation, following, its, de, facto, independence, from, mexico, he, continued, this, argument, in, 1846, for, the, same, reason, war, with, mexico, would, add, new, slavery, territory, to, the, nation, when, the, question, of, going, to, war, with, mexico, came, to, a, vote, on, may, 13, 1846, adams, spoke, a,

as, only, nominally, mexican, possessions, with, very, tenuous, ties, to, mexico, they, saw, the, territories, as, unsettled, ungoverned, and, unprotected, frontier, lands, whose, non, aboriginal,

position, on, the, origins, of, the, conflict, the, measures, the, u, s, had, taken, to, avoid, hostilities, and, the, justification, for, declaring, war, he, also, elaborated, upon, the, many, outstanding, financial, claims, by, american, citizens, against, mexico, and, argued, that, in, view, of, the, country, s, insolvency, the, cession, of, some, large, portion, of, its, northern,

angostura, or, the, narrows, several, miles, south, of, buena, vista, ranch, santa, anna, having, little, logistics, to, supply, his, army, suffered, desertions, all, the, long, march, north, and, arrived, with, only, 15, 000, men, in, a, tired, state, having, demanded, and, been, refused, the, surrender, of, the, u, s, army, santa, anna, s, army, attacked, the, next, morning, using, a, ruse, in, the, battle, with, the, u, s, forces, santa, anna, flanked, the, u, s, positions, by, sending, his, cavalry, and, some, of, his, infantry, up, the, steep, terrain, that, made, up, one, side, of, the, pass, while, a, division, of, infantry, attacked, frontally, to, distract, and, draw, out, the, u, s, forces, along, the, road, leading, to, buena, vista, furious, fighting, ensued, during, which, the, u, s, troops, were, nearly, routed, but, managed, to, cling, to, their, entrenched, position, thanks, to, the, mississippi, rifles, a, volunteer, regiment, led, by, jefferson, davis, who, formed, them, into, a, defensive, v, formation, the, mexicans, had, nearly, broken, the, american, lines, at, several, points, but, their, infantry, columns, navigating, the, narrow, pass, suffered, heavily, from, the, american, horse, artillery, which, fired, point, blank, canister, shots, to, break, up, the, attacks, initial, reports, of, the, battle, as, well, as, propaganda, from, the, santanistas, credited, the, victory, to, the, mexicans, much, to, the, joy, of, the, mexican, populace, but, rather, than, attack, the, next, day, and, finish, the, battle, santa, anna, retreated, losing, men, along, the, way, having, heard, word, of, rebellion, and, upheaval, in, mexico, city, taylor, was, left, in, control, of, part, of, northern, mexico, and, santa, anna, later, faced, criticism, for, his, withdrawal, mexican, and, american, military, historians, alike, agree, that, the, u, s, army, could, likely, have, been, defeated, if, santa, anna, had, fought, the, battle, to, its, finish, polk, mistrusted, taylor, who, he, felt, had, shown, incompetence, in, the, battle, of, monterrey, by, agreeing, to, the, armistice, taylor, later, used, the, battle, of, buena, vista, as, the, centerpiece, of, his, successful, 1848, presidential, campaign, northwestern, mexico, was, essentially, tribal, native, territory, but, on, november, 21, 1846, the, bear, springs, treaty, was, signed, ending, a, large, scale, insurrection, by, the, ute, zuni, moquis, and, navajo, tribes, in, december, 1846, after, the, successful, conquest, of, new, mexico, part, of, kearney, s, army, of, the, west, the, first, missouri, mounted, volunteers, moved, into, modern, day, northwest, mexico, they, were, led, by, alexander, w, doniphan, continuing, what, ended, up, being, a, year, long, 5, 500, mile, campaign, it, was, described, as, rivaling, xenophon, s, march, across, anatolia, during, the, greco, persian, wars, on, christmas, day, they, won, the, battle, of, el, brazito, outside, the, modern, day, el, paso, texas, on, march, 1, 1847, doniphan, occupied, chihuahua, city, british, consul, john, potts, did, not, want, to, allow, doniphan, to, search, governor, tr, as, s, mansion, and, unsuccessfully, asserted, it, was, under, british, protection, american, merchants, in, chihuahua, wanted, the, american, force, to, stay, in, order, to, protect, their, business, major, william, gilpin, advocated, a, march, on, mexico, city, and, convinced, a, majority, of, officers, but, doniphan, subverted, this, plan, then, in, late, april, taylor, ordered, the, first, missouri, mounted, volunteers, to, leave, chihuahua, and, join, him, at, saltillo, the, american, merchants, either, followed, or, returned, to, santa, fe, along, the, way, the, townspeople, of, parras, enlisted, doniphan, s, aid, against, a, native, raiding, party, that, had, taken, children, horses, mules, and, money, the, missouri, volunteers, finally, made, their, way, to, matamoros, from, which, they, returned, to, missouri, by, water, the, civilian, population, of, northern, mexico, offered, little, resistance, to, the, american, invasion, possibly, because, the, country, had, already, been, devastated, by, comanche, and, apache, native, raids, josiah, gregg, who, was, with, the, american, army, in, northern, mexico, said, the, whole, country, from, new, mexico, to, the, borders, of, durango, is, almost, entirely, depopulated, the, haciendas, and, ranchos, have, been, mostly, abandoned, and, the, people, chiefly, confined, to, the, towns, and, cities, southern, mexico, had, a, large, indigenous, population, and, was, geographically, distant, from, the, capital, over, which, the, central, government, had, weak, control, yucat, n, in, particular, had, closer, ties, to, cuba, and, to, the, united, states, than, it, did, to, central, mexico, on, a, number, of, occasions, in, the, early, era, of, the, mexican, republic, yucat, n, seceded, from, the, federation, there, were, also, rivalries, between, regional, elites, with, one, faction, based, in, m, rida, and, the, other, in, campeche, these, issues, factored, into, the, mexican, american, war, as, the, u, s, had, designs, on, this, part, of, the, coast, the, u, s, navy, contributed, to, the, war, by, controlling, the, coast, and, clearing, the, way, for, u, s, troops, and, supplies, especially, to, mexico, s, main, port, of, veracruz, even, before, hostilities, began, in, the, disputed, northern, region, the, u, s, navy, created, a, blockade, given, the, shallow, waters, of, that, portion, of, the, coast, the, u, s, navy, needed, ships, with, a, shallow, draft, rather, than, large, frigates, since, the, mexican, navy, was, almost, non, existent, the, u, s, navy, could, operate, unimpeded, in, gulf, waters, the, u, s, fought, two, battles, in, tabasco, in, october, 1846, and, in, june, 1847, in, 1847, the, maya, revolted, against, the, mexican, elites, of, the, peninsula, in, a, caste, war, known, as, the, caste, war, of, yucat, n, jefferson, davis, then, a, senator, from, mississippi, argued, in, congress, that, the, president, needed, no, further, powers, to, intervene, in, yucatan, since, the, war, with, mexico, was, underway, davis, s, concern, was, strategic, and, part, of, his, vision, of, manifest, destiny, considering, that, the, gulf, of, mexico, a, basin, of, water, belonging, to, the, united, states, and, that, the, cape, of, yucatan, and, the, island, of, cuba, must, be, ours, these, views, were, later, supported, by, the, knights, of, the, golden, circle, of, which, davis, was, allegedly, a, member, in, the, end, the, u, s, did, not, intervene, in, yucat, n, but, it, had, figured, in, congressional, debates, about, the, mexican, american, war, at, one, point, the, government, of, yucat, n, petitioned, the, u, s, for, protection, during, the, caste, war, but, the, u, s, did, not, respond, rather, than, reinforce, taylor, s, army, for, a, continued, advance, president, polk, sent, a, second, army, under, general, winfield, scott, polk, had, decided, that, the, way, to, bring, the, war, to, an, end, was, to, invade, the, mexican, heartland, from, the, coast, general, scott, s, army, was, transported, to, the, port, of, veracruz, by, sea, to, begin, an, invasion, to, take, the, mexican, capital, mexico, city, on, march, 9, 1847, scott, performed, the, first, major, amphibious, landing, in, u, s, history, in, preparation, for, a, siege, a, group, of, 12, 000, volunteer, and, regular, soldiers, successfully, offloaded, supplies, weapons, and, horses, near, the, walled, city, using, specially, designed, landing, crafts, included, in, the, invading, force, were, several, future, generals, robert, e, lee, george, meade, ulysses, s, grant, james, longstreet, and, thomas, stonewall, jackson, veracruz, was, defended, by, mexican, general, juan, morales, with, 3, 400, men, mortars, and, naval, guns, under, commodore, matthew, c, perry, were, used, to, reduce, the, city, walls, and, harass, defenders, the, bombardment, on, march, 24, 1847, opened, in, the, walls, of, veracruz, a, thirty, foot, gap, the, defenders, in, the, city, replied, with, their, own, artillery, but, the, extended, barrage, broke, the, will, of, the, mexicans, who, faced, a, numerically, superior, force, and, they, surrendered, the, city, after, 12, days, under, siege, u, s, troops, suffered, 80, casualties, while, the, mexicans, had, around, 180, killed, and, wounded, with, hundreds, of, civilians, killed, during, the, siege, the, u, s, soldiers, began, to, fall, victim, to, yellow, fever, santa, anna, allowed, scott, s, army, to, march, inland, counting, on, yellow, fever, and, other, tropical, diseases, to, take, their, toll, before, santa, anna, chose, a, place, to, engage, the, enemy, mexico, had, used, this, tactic, before, including, when, spain, attempted, to, reconquer, mexico, in, 1829, disease, could, be, a, decisive, factor, in, the, war, santa, anna, was, from, veracruz, so, he, was, on, his, home, territory, knew, the, terrain, and, had, a, network, of, allies, he, could, draw, on, local, resources, to, feed, his, hungry, army, and, gain, intelligence, on, the, enemy, s, movements, from, his, experience, in, the, northern, battles, on, open, terrain, santa, anna, sought, to, negate, the, u, s, army, s, primary, advantage, its, use, of, artillery, santa, anna, chose, cerro, gordo, as, the, place, to, engage, the, u, s, troops, calculating, the, terrain, would, offer, the, maximum, advantage, for, the, mexican, forces, scott, marched, westward, on, april, 2, 1847, toward, mexico, city, with, 8, 500, initially, healthy, troops, while, santa, anna, set, up, a, defensive, position, in, a, canyon, around, the, main, road, and, prepared, fortifications, santa, anna, had, entrenched, with, what, the, u, s, army, believed, were, 12, 000, troops, but, in, fact, was, around, 9, 000, he, had, artillery, trained, on, the, road, where, he, expected, scott, to, appear, however, scott, had, sent, 2, 600, mounted, dragoons, ahead, and, they, reached, the, pass, on, april, 12, the, mexican, artillery, prematurely, fired, on, them, and, therefore, revealed, their, positions, beginning, the, skirmish, instead, of, taking, the, main, road, scott, s, troops, trekked, through, the, rough, terrain, to, the, north, setting, up, his, artillery, on, the, high, ground, and, quietly, flanking, the, mexicans, although, by, then, aware, of, the, positions, of, u, s, troops, santa, anna, and, his, troops, were, unprepared, for, the, onslaught, that, followed, in, the, battle, fought, on, april, 18, the, mexican, army, was, routed, the, u, s, army, suffered, 400, casualties, while, the, mexicans, suffered, over, 1, 000, casualties, with, 3, 000, taken, prisoner, in, august, 1847, captain, kirby, smith, of, scott, s, 3rd, infantry, reflected, on, the, resistance, of, the, mexican, army, they, can, do, nothing, and, their, continued, defeats, should, convince, them, of, it, they, have, lost, six, great, battles, we, have, captured, six, hundred, and, eight, cannon, nearly, one, hundred, thousand, stands, of, arms, made, twenty, thousand, prisoners, have, the, greatest, portion, of, their, country, and, are, fast, advancing, on, their, capital, which, must, be, ours, yet, they, refuse, to, treat, the, u, s, army, had, expected, a, quick, collapse, of, the, mexican, forces, santa, anna, however, was, determined, to, fight, to, the, end, and, mexican, soldiers, continued, to, regroup, after, battles, to, fight, yet, again, on, may, 1, 1847, scott, pushed, on, to, puebla, the, second, largest, city, in, mexico, the, city, capitulated, without, resistance, the, mexican, defeat, at, cerro, gordo, had, demoralized, puebla, s, inhabitants, and, they, worried, about, harm, to, their, city, and, inhabitants, it, was, standard, practice, in, warfare, for, victorious, soldiers, to, be, let, loose, to, inflict, horrors, on, civilian, populations, if, they, resisted, the, threat, of, this, was, often, used, as, a, bargaining, tool, to, secure, surrender, without, a, fight, scott, had, orders, which, aimed, to, prevent, his, troops, from, such, violence, and, atrocities, puebla, s, ruling, elite, also, sought, to, prevent, violence, as, did, the, catholic, church, but, puebla, s, poor, and, working, class, wanted, to, defend, the, city, u, s, army, troops, who, strayed, outside, at, night, were, often, killed, enough, mexicans, were, willing, to, sell, supplies, to, the, u, s, army, to, make, local, provisioning, possible, during, the, following, months, scott, gathered, supplies, and, reinforcements, at, puebla, and, sent, back, units, whose, enlistments, had, expired, scott, also, made, strong, efforts, to, keep, his, troops, disciplined, and, treat, the, mexican, people, under, occupation, justly, to, keep, good, order, and, prevent, any, popular, uprising, against, his, army, with, guerrillas, harassing, his, line, of, communications, back, to, veracruz, scott, decided, not, to, weaken, his, army, to, defend, puebla, but, leaving, only, a, garrison, at, puebla, to, protect, the, sick, and, injured, recovering, there, advanced, on, mexico, city, on, august, 7, with, his, remaining, force, the, capital, was, laid, open, in, a, series, of, battles, around, the, right, flank, of, the, city, defenses, the, battle, of, contreras, and, battle, of, churubusco, after, churubusco, fighting, halted, for, an, armistice, and, peace, negotiations, which, broke, down, on, september, 6, 1847, with, the, subsequent, battles, of, molino, del, rey, and, of, chapultepec, and, the, storming, of, the, city, gates, the, capital, was, occupied, scott, became, military, governor, of, occupied, mexico, city, his, victories, in, this, campaign, made, him, an, american, national, hero, the, battle, of, chapultepec, in, september, 1847, was, a, siege, on, the, castle, of, chapultepec, built, on, a, hill, in, mexico, city, in, the, colonial, era, at, this, time, this, castle, was, a, renowned, military, school, in, the, capital, after, the, battle, which, ended, in, a, victory, for, the, u, s, the, legend, of, los, ni, os, h, roes, was, born, although, not, confirmed, by, historians, six, military, cadets, between, the, ages, of, 13, and, 17, stayed, in, the, school, instead, of, evacuating, they, decided, to, stay, and, fight, for, mexico, these, ni, os, h, roes, boy, heroes, became, icons, in, mexico, s, patriotic, pantheon, rather, than, surrender, to, the, u, s, army, some, military, cadets, leaped, from, the, castle, walls, a, cadet, named, juan, escutia, wrapped, himself, in, the, mexican, flag, and, jumped, to, his, death, in, late, september, 1847, santa, anna, made, one, last, attempt, to, defeat, the, u, s, army, by, cutting, them, off, from, the, coast, general, joaqu, n, rea, began, the, siege, of, puebla, soon, joined, by, santa, anna, scott, had, left, some, 2, 400, soldiers, in, puebla, of, whom, around, 400, were, fit, after, the, fall, of, mexico, city, santa, anna, hoped, to, rally, puebla, s, civilian, population, against, the, u, s, soldiers, under, siege, and, subject, to, guerrilla, attacks, before, the, mexican, army, could, wipe, out, the, americans, in, puebla, more, troops, landed, in, veracruz, under, the, command, of, brigadier, general, joseph, lane, at, puebla, they, sacked, the, town, santa, anna, was, not, able, to, provision, his, troops, who, effectively, dissolved, as, a, fighting, force, to, forage, for, food, puebla, was, relieved, by, lane, on, october, 12, following, his, defeat, of, santa, anna, at, the, battle, of, huamantla, on, october, 9, the, battle, was, santa, anna, s, last, following, the, capture, of, the, capital, the, mexican, government, moved, to, the, temporary, capital, at, quer, taro, in, mexico, city, u, s, forces, became, an, army, of, occupation, and, subject, to, stealth, attacks, from, the, urban, population, conventional, warfare, gave, way, to, guerrilla, warfare, by, mexicans, defending, their, homeland, they, inflicted, significant, casualties, on, the, u, s, army, particularly, on, soldiers, slow, to, keep, up, general, scott, sent, about, a, quarter, of, his, strength, to, secure, his, line, of, communications, to, veracruz, from, the, light, corps, of, general, rea, and, other, mexican, guerrilla, forces, that, had, made, stealth, attacks, since, may, mexican, guerrillas, often, tortured, and, mutilated, the, bodies, of, the, u, s, troops, as, revenge, and, warning, americans, interpreted, these, acts, not, as, mexicans, defense, of, their, country, but, as, evidence, of, mexicans, brutality, as, racial, inferiors, for, their, part, u, s, soldiers, took, revenge, on, mexicans, for, the, attacks, whether, or, not, they, were, individually, suspected, of, guerrilla, acts, scott, viewed, guerrilla, attacks, as, contrary, to, the, laws, of, war, and, threatened, the, property, of, populations, that, appeared, to, harbor, the, guerrillas, captured, guerrillas, were, to, be, shot, including, helpless, prisoners, with, the, reasoning, that, the, mexicans, did, the, same, historian, peter, guardino, contends, that, the, u, s, army, command, was, complicit, in, the, attacks, against, mexican, civilians, by, threatening, the, civilian, populations, homes, property, and, families, with, burning, whole, villages, looting, and, raping, women, the, u, s, army, separated, guerrillas, from, their, base, guerrillas, cost, the, americans, dearly, but, indirectly, cost, mexican, civilians, more, scott, strengthened, the, garrison, of, puebla, and, by, november, had, added, a, 1, 200, man, garrison, at, jalapa, established, 750, man, posts, along, the, main, route, between, the, port, of, veracruz, and, the, capital, at, the, pass, between, mexico, city, and, puebla, at, rio, frio, at, perote, and, san, juan, on, the, road, between, jalapa, and, puebla, and, at, puente, nacional, between, jalapa, and, veracruz, he, had, also, detailed, an, anti, guerrilla, brigade, under, lane, to, carry, the, war, to, the, light, corps, and, other, guerrillas, he, ordered, that, convoys, would, travel, with, at, least, 1, 300, man, escorts, victories, by, lane, over, the, light, corps, at, atlixco, october, 18, 1847, at, iz, car, de, matamoros, november, 23, 1847, and, at, galaxara, pass, november, 24, 1847, weakened, general, rea, s, forces, later, a, raid, against, the, guerrillas, of, padre, jarauta, at, zacualtipan, february, 25, 1848, further, reduced, guerrilla, raids, on, the, american, line, of, communications, after, the, two, governments, concluded, a, truce, to, await, ratification, of, the, peace, treaty, on, march, 6, 1848, formal, hostilities, ceased, however, some, bands, continued, in, defiance, of, the, mexican, government, until, the, u, s, army, s, evacuation, in, august, some, were, suppressed, by, the, mexican, army, or, like, padre, jarauta, executed, desertion, was, a, major, problem, for, both, armies, in, the, mexican, army, desertions, depleted, forces, on, the, eve, of, battle, most, soldiers, were, peasants, who, had, a, loyalty, to, their, village, and, family, but, not, to, the, generals, who, had, conscripted, them, often, hungry, and, ill, underequipped, only, partially, trained, and, under, paid, the, soldiers, were, held, in, contempt, by, their, officers, and, had, little, reason, to, fight, the, americans, looking, for, their, opportunity, many, slipped, away, from, camp, to, find, their, way, back, to, their, home, village, the, desertion, rate, in, the, u, s, army, was, 8, 3, 9, 200, out, of, 111, 000, compared, to, 12, 7, during, the, war, of, 1812, and, usual, peacetime, rates, of, about, 14, 8, per, year, many, men, deserted, to, join, another, u, s, unit, and, get, a, second, enlistment, bonus, some, deserted, because, of, the, miserable, conditions, in, camp, it, has, been, suggested, that, others, used, the, army, to, get, free, transportation, to, california, where, they, deserted, to, join, the, gold, rush, this, however, is, unlikely, as, gold, was, only, discovered, in, california, on, january, 24, 1848, less, than, two, weeks, before, the, war, concluded, by, the, time, word, reached, the, eastern, u, s, that, gold, had, been, discovered, word, also, reached, it, that, the, war, was, over, hundreds, of, u, s, deserters, went, over, to, the, mexican, side, nearly, all, were, recent, immigrants, from, europe, with, weak, ties, to, the, u, s, the, mexicans, issued, broadsides, and, leaflets, enticing, u, s, soldiers, with, promises, of, money, land, bounties, and, officers, commissions, mexican, guerrillas, shadowed, the, u, s, army, and, captured, men, who, took, unauthorized, leave, or, fell, out, of, the, ranks, the, guerrillas, sometimes, coerced, these, men, to, join, the, mexican, ranks, the, most, famous, group, of, deserters, from, the, u, s, army, was, the, saint, patrick, s, battalion, or, san, patricios, composed, primarily, of, several, hundred, immigrant, soldiers, the, majority, catholic, irish, and, german, immigrants, who, deserted, the, u, s, army, because, of, ill, treatment, or, sympathetic, leanings, to, fellow, mexican, catholics, and, joined, the, mexican, army, the, battalion, also, included, canadians, english, french, italians, poles, scots, spaniards, swiss, and, mexican, people, many, of, whom, were, members, of, the, catholic, church, most, of, the, battalion, were, killed, in, the, battle, of, churubusco, about, 100, were, captured, by, the, u, s, and, roughly, half, of, the, san, patricios, were, tried, and, were, hanged, as, deserters, following, their, capture, at, churubusco, in, august, 1847, the, leader, john, riley, was, branded, a, bust, of, john, riley, and, a, plaque, on, the, fa, ade, of, a, building, in, plaza, san, jacinto, san, angel, commemorates, the, place, where, they, were, hanged, outnumbered, militarily, and, with, many, large, cities, of, the, mexican, heartland, including, its, capital, occupied, mexico, could, not, defend, itself, in, conventional, warfare, mexico, faced, many, continuing, internal, divisions, between, factions, so, that, bringing, the, war, to, a, formal, end, was, not, straightforward, although, there, were, complications, with, negotiating, peace, on, both, ends, peace, came, in, alta, california, in, january, 1847, with, the, treaty, of, cahuenga, with, the, californios, mexican, residents, of, alta, california, capitulating, to, the, american, forces, a, more, comprehensive, peace, treaty, was, needed, to, end, the, conflict, the, u, s, forces, had, gone, from, being, an, army, of, conquest, on, the, periphery, for, territory, it, desired, to, incorporate, to, an, invading, force, in, central, mexico, potentially, making, it, an, army, of, long, term, occupation, mexico, did, not, necessarily, have, to, sign, a, peace, treaty, but, could, have, continued, with, long, term, guerrilla, warfare, against, the, u, s, army, however, it, could, not, expel, the, invaders, so, negotiating, a, treaty, became, more, necessary, polk, s, wish, for, a, short, war, of, conquest, against, a, perceived, weak, enemy, with, no, will, to, fight, had, turned, into, a, long, and, bloody, conflict, in, mexico, s, heartland, negotiating, a, treaty, was, in, the, best, interest, of, the, united, states, it, was, not, easy, to, achieve, polk, lost, confidence, in, his, negotiator, nicholas, trist, and, dismissed, him, as, peace, negotiations, dragged, on, trist, ignored, the, fact, that, he, no, longer, had, the, authorization, to, act, for, the, united, states, when, trist, managed, to, get, yet, another, mexican, government, to, sign, the, treaty, of, guadalupe, hidalgo, polk, was, presented, with, an, accomplished, fact, and, decided, to, take, it, to, congress, for, ratification, ratification, was, fraught, since, the, democrats, had, lost, the, elections, of, 1846, and, whigs, opposed, to, the, war, were, now, in, ascendance, having, won, a, decisive, victory, the, u, s, was, divided, on, what, the, peace, should, entail, now, that, the, u, s, had, gone, far, beyond, the, territorial, gains, it, initially, envisioned, by, invading, central, mexico, with, its, dense, population, the, question, was, raised, whether, to, annex, the, entirety, of, mexico, after, the, wilmot, proviso, there, was, a, lessening, of, fervor, for, the, idea, but, the, taking, of, mexico, city, had, revived, enthusiasm, there, were, fierce, objections, in, congress, to, that, on, racial, grounds, south, carolina, senator, john, c, calhoun, argued, that, absorbing, mexico, would, threaten, u, s, institutions, and, the, character, of, the, country, we, have, never, dreamt, of, incorporating, into, our, union, any, but, the, caucasian, race, the, free, white, race, to, incorporate, mexico, would, be, the, first, instance, of, the, kind, of, incorporating, an, indian, race, for, more, than, half, of, the, mexicans, are, indians, and, the, other, is, composed, chiefly, of, mixed, tribes, i, protest, against, such, a, union, as, that, ours, sir, is, the, government, of, a, white, race, we, are, anxious, to, force, free, government, on, all, and, i, see, that, it, has, been, urged, that, it, is, the, mission, of, this, country, to, spread, civil, and, religious, liberty, over, all, the, world, and, especially, over, this, continent, it, is, a, great, mistake, beyond, the, racial, argument, calhoun, contended, that, the, u, s, could, not, be, both, an, empire, and, a, republic, and, he, argued, that, being, an, empire, would, strengthen, the, central, government, and, be, detrimental, to, individual, states, rhode, island, whig, senator, john, clarke, also, objected, to, annexing, all, of, mexico, to, incorporate, such, a, disjointed, and, degraded, mass, into, even, a, limited, participation, with, our, social, and, political, rights, would, be, fatally, destructive, to, the, institutions, of, our, country, there, is, a, moral, pestilence, to, such, a, people, which, is, contagious, a, leprosy, that, will, destroy, the, treaty, of, guadalupe, hidalgo, signed, on, february, 2, 1848, by, diplomat, nicholas, trist, and, mexican, plenipotentiary, representatives, luis, g, cuevas, bernardo, couto, and, miguel, atristain, ended, the, war, the, treaty, gave, the, u, s, undisputed, control, of, texas, established, the, u, s, mexican, border, along, the, rio, grande, and, ceded, to, the, united, states, the, present, day, states, of, california, nevada, and, utah, most, of, new, mexico, arizona, and, colorado, and, parts, of, texas, oklahoma, kansas, and, wyoming, in, return, mexico, received, 15, million, 528, million, today, less, than, half, the, amount, the, u, s, had, attempted, to, offer, mexico, for, the, land, before, the, opening, of, hostilities, and, the, u, s, agreed, to, assume, 3, 25, million, 114, million, today, in, debts, that, the, mexican, government, owed, to, u, s, citizens, the, area, of, domain, acquired, was, given, by, the, federal, interagency, committee, as, 338, 680, 960, acres, the, cost, was, 16, 295, 149, or, approximately, five, cents, per, acre, the, area, amounted, to, one, third, of, mexico, s, original, territory, from, its, 1821, independence, the, treaty, was, ratified, by, the, u, s, senate, by, a, vote, of, 38, to, 14, on, march, 10, and, by, mexico, through, a, legislative, vote, of, 51, 34, and, a, senate, vote, of, 33, 4, on, may, 19, news, that, new, mexico, s, legislative, assembly, had, passed, an, act, for, the, organization, of, a, u, s, territorial, government, helped, ease, mexican, concern, about, abandoning, the, people, of, new, mexico, the, acquisition, was, a, source, of, controversy, especially, among, u, s, politicians, who, had, opposed, the, war, from, the, start, a, leading, anti, war, u, s, newspaper, the, whig, national, intelligencer, sardonically, concluded, that, we, take, nothing, by, conquest, thank, god, the, acquired, lands, west, of, the, rio, grande, are, traditionally, called, the, mexican, cession, in, the, u, s, as, opposed, to, the, texas, annexation, two, years, earlier, though, the, division, of, new, mexico, down, the, middle, at, the, rio, grande, never, had, any, basis, either, in, control, or, mexican, boundaries, mexico, never, recognized, the, independence, of, texas, before, the, war, and, did, not, cede, its, claim, to, territory, north, of, the, rio, grande, or, gila, river, until, this, treaty, before, ratifying, the, treaty, the, u, s, senate, made, two, modifications, changing, the, wording, of, article, ix, which, guaranteed, mexicans, living, in, the, purchased, territories, the, right, to, become, u, s, citizens, and, striking, out, article, x, which, conceded, the, legitimacy, of, land, grants, made, by, the, mexican, government, on, may, 26, 1848, when, the, two, countries, exchanged, ratifications, of, the, treaty, they, further, agreed, to, a, three, article, protocol, known, as, the, protocol, of, quer, taro, to, explain, the, amendments, the, first, article, claimed, that, the, original, article, ix, of, the, treaty, although, replaced, by, article, iii, of, the, treaty, of, louisiana, would, still, confer, the, rights, delineated, in, article, ix, the, second, article, confirmed, the, legitimacy, of, land, grants, under, mexican, law, the, protocol, was, signed, in, the, city, of, quer, taro, by, a, h, sevier, nathan, clifford, and, luis, de, la, rosa, article, xi, offered, a, potential, benefit, to, mexico, in, that, the, u, s, pledged, to, suppress, the, comanche, and, apache, raids, that, had, ravaged, the, region, and, pay, restitution, to, the, victims, of, raids, it, could, not, prevent, however, the, native, raids, did, not, cease, for, several, decades, after, the, treaty, although, a, cholera, epidemic, in, 1849, greatly, reduced, the, numbers, of, the, comanche, robert, letcher, u, s, minister, to, mexico, in, 1850, was, certain, that, miserable, 11th, article, would, lead, to, the, financial, ruin, of, the, u, s, if, it, could, not, be, released, from, its, obligations, the, u, s, was, released, from, all, obligations, of, article, xi, five, years, later, by, article, ii, of, the, gadsden, purchase, of, 1853, before, the, secession, of, texas, mexico, comprised, almost, 1, 700, 000, sq, mi, 4, 400, 000, km, 2, but, by, 1849, it, was, just, under, 800, 000, square, miles, 2, 100, 000, km, 2, another, 30, 000, square, miles, 78, 000, km, 2, were, sold, to, the, u, s, in, the, gadsden, purchase, of, 1853, so, the, total, reduction, of, mexican, territory, was, more, than, 55, or, 900, 000, square, miles, 2, 300, 000, km, 2, although, the, annexed, territory, was, about, the, size, of, western, europe, it, was, sparsely, populated, the, land, contained, about, 14, 000, non, indigenous, people, in, alta, california, and, about, 60, 000, in, nuevo, m, xico, as, well, as, large, native, nations, such, as, the, papago, pima, puebloan, navajo, apache, and, many, others, although, some, native, people, relocated, farther, south, in, mexico, the, great, majority, remained, in, the, u, s, territory, the, u, s, settlers, surging, into, the, newly, conquered, southwest, replaced, mexican, law, a, civil, law, system, based, on, the, law, of, spain, which, in, the, law, of, april, 6, 1830, forbade, any, further, immigration, however, they, recognized, the, value, of, a, few, aspects, of, mexican, law, and, carried, them, over, into, their, new, legal, systems, for, example, most, of, the, southwestern, states, adopted, community, property, marital, property, systems, as, well, as, water, law, many, mexicans, including, mestizos, afro, mexicans, and, indigenous, peoples, in, the, annexed, territories, experienced, a, loss, of, civil, and, political, rights, the, treaty, of, guadalupe, hidalgo, promised, u, s, citizenship, to, all, former, mexican, citizens, living, in, the, territories, however, the, united, states, gave, ceded, states, the, authority, to, establish, citizenship, policy, and, within, a, year, states, were, passing, laws, that, banned, all, mexicans, in, arizona, california, new, mexico, and, texas, from, u, s, citizenship, except, white, male, mexicans, furthermore, non, white, mexicans, lost, certain, citizenship, rights, such, as, the, right, to, practice, law, vote, or, hold, certain, government, positions, indigenous, peoples, lost, land, rights, and, were, exterminated, as, in, the, california, genocide, or, forced, into, reservations, mexico, lost, part, of, its, northern, territories, in, nevada, utah, colorado, oklahoma, kansas, and, wyoming, that, included, few, if, any, mexicans, and, many, indigenous, groups, furthermore, the, u, s, government, did, not, grant, full, citizenship, to, native, americans, in, the, southwest, until, the, 1930s, even, though, they, were, mexican, citizens, the, california, constitution, of, 1849, conferred, voting, rights, only, to, white, male, citizens, article, ii, section, 1, and, the, number, of, senators, was, proportioned, only, according, to, the, number, of, white, inhabitants, article, iv, section, 29, in, much, of, the, united, states, victory, and, the, acquisition, of, new, land, brought, a, surge, of, patriotism, victory, seemed, to, fulfill, democrats, belief, in, their, country, s, manifest, destiny, although, the, whigs, had, opposed, the, war, they, made, zachary, taylor, their, presidential, candidate, in, the, election, of, 1848, praising, his, military, performance, while, muting, their, criticism, of, the, war, has, the, mexican, war, terminated, yet, and, how, are, we, beaten, do, you, know, of, any, nation, about, to, besiege, south, hadley, if, so, do, inform, me, of, it, for, i, would, be, glad, of, a, chance, to, escape, if, we, are, to, be, stormed, i, suppose, miss, lyon, would, furnish, us, all, with, daggers, and, order, us, to, fight, for, our, lives, a, month, before, the, end, of, the, war, polk, was, criticized, in, a, united, states, house, of, representatives, amendment, to, a, bill, praising, taylor, for, a, war, unnecessarily, and, unconstitutionally, begun, by, the, president, of, the, united, states, this, criticism, in, which, congressman, abraham, lincoln, played, an, important, role, with, his, spot, resolutions, followed, congressional, scrutiny, of, the, war, s, beginnings, including, factual, challenges, to, claims, made, by, president, polk, the, vote, followed, party, lines, with, all, whigs, supporting, the, amendment, lincoln, s, attack, won, lukewarm, support, from, fellow, whigs, in, illinois, but, was, harshly, counter, attacked, by, democrats, who, rallied, pro, war, sentiments, in, illinois, lincoln, s, spot, resolutions, haunted, his, future, campaigns, in, the, heavily, democratic, state, of, illinois, and, were, cited, by, his, rivals, well, into, his, presidency, while, the, whig, emerson, rejected, war, as, a, means, of, achieving, america, s, destiny, toward, the, end, of, the, war, he, wrote, the, united, states, will, conquer, mexico, but, it, will, be, as, the, man, swallows, the, arsenic, which, brings, him, down, in, turn, mexico, will, poison, us, he, later, accepted, that, most, of, the, great, results, of, history, are, brought, about, by, discreditable, means, civil, war, historian, james, m, mcpherson, dedicates, an, entire, chapter, of, his, pulitzer, winning, civil, war, history, to, the, mexican, american, war, entitled, mexico, will, poison, us, mcpherson, argues, that, the, mexican, american, war, and, its, aftermath, was, a, key, territorial, event, in, the, leadup, to, the, civil, war, veterans, of, the, war, were, often, broken, men, as, the, sick, and, wounded, from, taylor, s, and, scott, s, campaigns, made, their, way, back, from, mexico, to, the, united, states, their, condition, shocked, the, folks, at, home, husbands, sons, and, brothers, returned, in, broken, health, some, with, missing, limbs, the, 1880, republican, campaign, textbook, by, the, republican, congressional, committee, describes, the, war, as, feculent, reeking, corruption, and, one, of, the, darkest, scenes, in, our, history, a, war, forced, upon, our, and, the, mexican, people, by, the, high, handed, usurpations, of, pres, t, polk, in, pursuit, of, territorial, aggrandizement, of, the, slave, oligarchy, following, the, signing, of, the, 1848, treaty, polk, sought, to, send, troops, to, yucatan, where, there, was, a, civil, war, between, secessionists, and, those, supporting, the, mexican, government, the, u, s, congress, refused, his, request, the, mexican, war, was, supposed, to, be, short, and, nearly, bloodless, it, was, neither, congress, did, not, support, more, foreign, conflict, many, of, the, military, leaders, on, both, sides, of, the, american, civil, war, of, 1861, 1865, had, trained, at, the, u, s, military, academy, at, west, point, and, had, fought, as, junior, officers, in, mexico, this, list, includes, military, men, fighting, for, the, union, ulysses, s, grant, george, b, mcclellan, william, t, sherman, george, meade, and, ambrose, burnside, military, men, who, joined, the, southern, secessionists, of, the, confederacy, included, robert, e, lee, albert, sidney, johnston, stonewall, jackson, james, longstreet, joseph, e, johnston, braxton, bragg, sterling, price, and, the, future, confederate, president, jefferson, davis, both, sides, had, leaders, with, significant, experience, in, active, combat, strategy, and, tactics, for, grant, who, went, on, to, lead, union, forces, in, the, civil, war, and, later, was, elected, president, it, also, tutored, him, in, the, manifold, ways, wars, are, shot, through, with, political, calculations, grant, had, served, in, mexico, under, general, zachary, taylor, and, was, appointed, acting, assistant, quartermaster, for, taylor, s, army, a, post, he, tried, to, decline, since, it, took, him, away, from, the, battlefield, however, the, appointment, was, actually, a, godsend, for, grant, turning, him, into, a, complete, soldier, adept, at, every, facet, of, army, life, especially, logistics, this, provided, invaluable, training, for, the, civil, war, when, grant, would, need, to, sustain, gigantic, armies, in, the, field, distant, from, northern, supply, depots, grant, saw, considerable, combat, and, demonstrated, his, coolness, under, fire, in, the, battle, of, chapultepec, he, and, his, men, hoisted, a, howitzer, into, a, church, belfry, that, had, a, commanding, view, of, the, san, cosme, gate, the, action, brought, him, the, honorary, rank, of, brevet, captain, for, gallant, and, meritorious, conduct, in, the, battle, of, chapultepec, grant, later, recalled, in, his, memoirs, published, in, 1885, that, generally, the, officers, of, the, army, were, indifferent, whether, the, annexation, was, consummated, or, not, but, not, so, all, of, them, for, myself, i, was, bitterly, opposed, to, the, measure, and, to, this, day, regard, the, war, which, resulted, as, one, of, the, most, unjust, ever, waged, by, a, stronger, against, a, weaker, nation, it, was, an, instance, of, a, republic, following, the, bad, example, of, european, monarchies, in, not, considering, justice, in, their, desire, to, acquire, additional, territory, grant, also, expressed, the, view, that, the, war, against, mexico, had, brought, punishment, on, the, united, states, in, the, form, of, the, american, civil, war, the, southern, rebellion, was, largely, the, outgrowth, of, the, mexican, war, nations, like, individuals, are, punished, for, their, transgressions, we, got, our, punishment, in, the, most, sanguinary, and, expensive, war, of, modern, times, robert, e, lee, commander, of, the, confederate, forces, through, the, end, of, the, civil, war, began, building, his, reputation, as, a, military, officer, in, america, s, war, against, mexico, at, the, start, of, the, mexican, american, war, captain, lee, invaded, mexico, with, general, wool, s, engineering, department, from, the, north, by, early, 1847, he, helped, take, the, mexican, cities, of, vera, cruz, cerro, gordo, contreras, churubusco, molino, del, rey, and, chapultepec, lee, was, wounded, in, chapultepec, general, scott, described, robert, e, lee, as, gallant, and, indefatigable, saying, that, lee, had, displayed, the, greatest, feat, of, physical, and, moral, courage, performed, by, any, individual, in, knowledge, during, the, campaign, grant, gained, insight, into, robert, e, lee, as, his, memoir, states, i, had, known, him, personally, and, knew, that, he, was, mortal, and, it, was, just, as, well, that, i, felt, this, in, 1861, general, scott, advised, abraham, lincoln, to, ask, lee, to, command, u, s, forces, lee, declined, and, later, recounted, i, declined, the, offer, he, made, me, to, take, command, of, the, army, that, was, brought, into, the, field, stating, candidly, and, as, courteously, as, i, could, that, though, opposed, to, secession, and, deprecating, war, i, could, take, no, part, in, the, invasion, of, the, southern, states, despite, initial, objections, from, the, whigs, and, from, abolitionists, the, mexican, war, nevertheless, united, the, u, s, in, a, common, cause, and, was, fought, almost, entirely, by, volunteers, the, united, states, army, swelled, from, just, over, 6, 000, to, more, than, 115, 000, the, majority, of, 12, month, volunteers, in, scott, s, army, decided, that, a, year, s, fighting, was, enough, and, returned, to, the, u, s, anti, slavery, elements, fought, for, the, exclusion, of, slavery, from, any, territory, absorbed, by, the, u, s, in, 1847, the, house, of, representatives, passed, the, wilmot, proviso, stipulating, that, none, of, the, territory, acquired, should, be, open, to, slavery, if, successful, the, wilmot, proviso, would, have, effectively, cancelled, out, the, 1820, missouri, compromise, since, it, would, have, prohibited, slavery, in, an, area, below, the, parallel, 36, 30, north, the, senate, avoided, the, issue, and, a, late, attempt, to, add, it, to, the, treaty, of, guadalupe, hidalgo, was, defeated, because, southern, senators, had, the, votes, to, prevent, its, addition, the, house, of, representatives, is, apportioned, by, population, and, the, north, s, was, growing, allowing, it, to, win, the, majority, of, the, house, in, the, 1846, elections, but, the, senate, representation, is, two, per, state, and, southerners, had, enough, votes, to, block, the, addition, the, war, proved, a, decisive, event, for, the, u, s, marking, a, significant, turning, point, for, the, nation, as, a, growing, military, power, it, is, also, a, milestone, in, the, u, s, narrative, of, manifest, destiny, the, war, did, not, resolve, the, issue, of, slavery, in, the, u, s, but, rather, in, many, ways, inflamed, it, as, potential, westward, expansion, of, the, institution, became, an, increasingly, central, and, heated, theme, in, national, debates, preceding, the, american, civil, war, by, extending, the, territory, of, the, united, states, to, the, pacific, ocean, the, end, of, the, mexican, american, war, marked, a, new, step, in, the, huge, migrations, of, americans, to, the, west, which, culminated, in, transcontinental, railroads, and, the, indian, wars, later, in, the, same, century, following, the, civil, war, veterans, of, the, mexican, war, began, to, organize, themselves, as, veterans, regardless, of, rank, and, lobbied, for, their, service, initially, they, sought, to, create, a, soldiers, home, for, aged, and, ailing, veterans, but, then, began, pushing, for, pensions, in, 1874, there, was, resistance, in, congress, since, veterans, had, received, warrants, for, up, to, 160, acres, of, land, for, their, service, pensions, would, have, put, a, fiscal, strain, on, the, government, the, politics, were, complicated, since, so, many, veterans, of, the, mexican, war, fought, for, the, confederacy, in, the, civil, war, republican, congressmen, accused, them, of, attempting, to, give, federal, aid, to, former, confederates, this, led, to, a, thirteen, year, congressional, debate, over, the, loyalty, of, the, veterans, and, their, worthiness, to, receive, federal, assistance, in, their, declining, years, in, 1887, the, mexican, veteran, pension, law, went, into, effect, making, veterans, eligible, for, a, pension, for, their, service, surviving, officers, and, enlisted, men, were, placed, on, a, pension, roll, which, included, volunteers, militias, and, marines, who, had, served, at, least, 60, days, and, were, at, least, 62, years, old, widows, of, veterans, who, had, not, remarried, were, eligible, for, their, late, husband, s, pension, excluded, was, any, person, while, under, the, political, disabilities, imposed, by, the, fourteenth, amendment, to, the, united, states, constitution, that, is, veterans, who, had, fought, for, the, confederacy, in, the, civil, war, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, u, s, troops, under, taylor, s, command, adhered, to, the, rules, of, war, for, the, most, part, under, the, watchful, eye, of, taylor, and, almost, exclusively, engaged, with, enemy, soldiers, this, gained, them, some, popularity, with, mexican, civilians, who, held, the, occupying, americans, in, a, degree, of, high, regard, compared, to, the, mexican, army, who, left, their, wounded, to, be, captured, by, the, enemy, as, they, retreated, from, the, area, in, june, 1846, the, situation, changed, when, american, reinforcements, entered, the, area, and, began, raiding, local, farms, many, soldiers, on, garrison, duty, began, committing, crimes, against, civilians, such, as, robbery, rape, and, murder, in, order, to, alleviate, their, boredom, this, wave, of, wanton, crime, resulted, in, american, soldiers, murdering, at, least, 20, civilians, during, the, first, month, of, occupation, taylor, initially, showed, little, concern, with, the, crimes, the, soldiers, were, committing, and, failed, to, discipline, the, soldiers, responsible, for, them, or, devise, ways, to, prevent, crimes, this, led, to, public, opinion, turning, against, the, u, s, troops, and, resulted, in, many, mexicans, taking, up, arms, and, forming, guerrilla, bands, which, attacked, patrols, of, u, s, soldiers, the, attacks, continued, to, get, more, prevalent, especially, after, the, battle, of, monterrey, during, this, time, anti, catholic, sentiment, and, racism, fueled, further, attacks, against, mexican, civilians, it, was, estimated, that, u, s, troops, killed, at, least, 100, civilians, with, the, majority, of, them, being, killed, by, the, 1st, texas, mounted, volunteers, commanded, by, colonel, john, c, hays, u, s, troops, under, the, command, of, capt, mabry, b, mustang, gray, responded, to, the, killing, of, an, american, soldier, outside, of, monterrey, by, mexicans, by, abducting, and, summarily, executing, 24, unarmed, mexican, civilians, in, november, 1846, a, detachment, from, the, 1st, kentucky, regiment, murdered, a, young, mexican, boy, ostensibly, as, a, form, of, sport, afterwards, taylor, failed, to, bring, charges, against, any, of, the, soldiers, involved, the, most, infamous, incident, occurred, on, october, 9, 1847, after, captain, samuel, hamilton, walker, and, 12, others, were, killed, in, a, skirmish, joseph, lane, ordered, his, men, to, avenge, the, dead, texas, rangers, by, sacking, the, town, of, huamantla, the, soldiers, quickly, became, drunk, after, raiding, a, liquor, store, and, began, targeting, the, townspeople, raping, and, killing, dozens, of, mexican, civilians, while, indiscriminately, burning, their, homes, however, these, reports, of, an, american, rampage, were, overshadowed, by, the, news, of, santa, anna, s, resignation, after, the, huamantla, attack, leading, to, no, repercussions, against, lane, or, any, of, the, soldiers, involved, in, the, atrocities, throughout, the, course, of, the, war, a, number, of, u, s, troops, who, had, become, disillusioned, with, the, war, defected, to, the, mexican, army, and, joined, the, saint, patrick, s, battalion, to, fight, for, the, mexicans, against, the, u, s, forces, the, great, majority, of, those, who, made, up, the, saint, patrick, s, battalion, were, recent, immigrants, who, had, arrived, in, the, northeastern, u, s, from, ireland, many, defected, due, to, mistreatment, by, nativist, soldiers, and, senior, officers, brutal, military, discipline, or, because, they, were, not, allowed, to, practice, their, catholic, religion, thousands, of, other, u, s, soldiers, simply, deserted, for, mexico, the, war, had, remained, a, painful, historical, event, for, the, country, losing, territory, and, highlighting, the, domestic, political, conflicts, that, were, to, continue, for, another, 20, years, the, reform, war, between, liberals, and, conservatives, in, 1857, was, followed, by, the, second, french, intervention, in, 1861, which, set, up, the, second, mexican, empire, the, war, caused, mexico, to, enter, a, period, of, self, examination, as, its, leaders, sought, to, identify, and, address, the, reasons, that, had, led, to, such, a, debacle, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, the, war, a, group, of, mexican, writers, including, ignacio, ram, rez, guillermo, prieto, jos,
