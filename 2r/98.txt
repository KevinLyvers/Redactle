9, 30, n, 8, 0, e, 9, 500, n, 8, 000, e, 9, 500, 8, 000, the, nok, culture, is, a, population, whose, material, remains, are, named, after, the, ham, village, of, nok, in, southern, kaduna, state, of, nigeria, where, their, terracotta, sculptures, were, first, discovered, in, 1928, the, nok, people, and, the, gajiganna, people, may, have, migrated, from, the, central, sahara, along, with, pearl, millet, and, pottery, diverged, prior, to, arriving, in, the, northern, region, of, nigeria, and, thus, settled, in, their, respective, locations, in, the, region, of, gajiganna, and, nok, nok, people, may, have, also, migrated, from, the, west, african, sahel, to, the, region, of, nok, nok, culture, may, have, emerged, in, 1500, bce, and, continued, to, persist, until, 1, bce, nok, people, may, have, developed, terracotta, sculptures, through, large, scale, economic, production, as, part, of, a, complex, funerary, culture, that, may, have, included, practices, such, as, feasting, the, earliest, nok, terracotta, sculptures, may, have, developed, in, 900, bce, some, nok, terracotta, sculptures, portray, figures, wielding, slingshots, as, well, as, bows, and, arrows, which, may, be, indicative, of, nok, people, engaging, in, the, hunting, or, trapping, of, undomesticated, animals, a, nok, sculpture, portrays, two, individuals, along, with, their, goods, in, a, dugout, canoe, both, of, the, anthropomorphic, figures, in, the, watercraft, are, paddling, the, nok, terracotta, depiction, of, a, dugout, canoe, may, indicate, that, nok, people, used, dugout, canoes, to, transport, cargo, along, tributaries, e, g, gurara, river, of, the, niger, river, and, exchanged, them, in, a, regional, trade, network, the, nok, terracotta, depiction, of, a, figure, with, a, seashell, on, its, head, may, indicate, that, the, span, of, these, riverine, trade, routes, may, have, extended, to, the, atlantic, coast, in, the, maritime, history, of, africa, there, is, the, earlier, dufuna, canoe, which, was, constructed, approximately, 8000, years, ago, in, the, northern, region, of, nigeria, as, the, second, earliest, form, of, water, vessel, known, in, sub, saharan, africa, the, nok, terracotta, depiction, of, a, dugout, canoe, was, created, in, the, central, region, of, nigeria, during, the, first, millennium, bce, as, part, of, nok, traditional, medicine, nok, ceramics, may, have, been, used, to, process, roots, and, bark, as, medicinal, plants, for, the, production, of, medicinal, decoctions, excluding, ancient, egyptian, figurative, art, nok, sculptures, are, regarded, to, be, the, most, early, large, figurative, art, in, continental, africa, latter, artistic, traditions, of, west, africa, bura, of, niger, 3rd, century, ce, 10th, century, ce, koma, of, ghana, 7th, century, ce, 15th, century, ce, igbo, ukwu, of, nigeria, 9th, century, ce, 10th, century, ce, jenne, jeno, of, mali, 11th, century, ce, 12th, century, ce, and, ile, ife, of, nigeria, 11th, century, ce, 15th, century, ce, may, have, been, shaped, by, the, earlier, west, african, clay, terracotta, tradition, of, the, nok, culture, nok, settlement, sites, are, often, found, on, mountaintops, iron, metallurgy, may, have, independently, developed, in, the, nok, culture, between, 750, bce, and, 550, bce, breunig, and, rupp, 2016, stated, their, origin, is, unknown, but, since, the, plants, they, used, as, crops, especially, millet, are, indigenous, to, the, sahel, region, a, northern, homeland, is, more, probable, than, any, other, breunig, 2017, expounded, the, people, of, the, nok, culture, must, have, come, from, somewhere, else, so, far, however, we, have, not, found, out, what, region, though, we, suspect, the, sahel, zone, in, west, africa, champion, et, al, 2022, suggested, that, they, may, have, come, from, the, central, sahara, and, stated, the, cultivation, of, pearl, millet, diffused, from, the, desiccating, west, and, central, sahara, into, the, west, african, savanna, zone, after, 2500, bce, in, the, context, of, southwards, population, movements, ozainne, et, al, 2014, neumann, 2018, fuller, et, al, 2021, the, presence, of, pearl, millet, without, roulette, decorations, or, chaff, temper, as, seen, in, the, nok, and, early, gajiganna, sites, suggests, that, the, third, diffusion, originated, directly, from, the, central, sahara, and, possibly, split, before, reaching, northern, nigeria, accounting, for, the, differences, in, nok, and, gajiganna, pottery, fig, 8, and, see, champion, 2020, p, 462, the, first, nok, terracotta, was, discovered, in, 1928, by, colonel, dent, young, a, co, owner, of, a, mining, partnership, near, the, village, of, nok, in, kaduna, state, nigeria, the, terracotta, was, accidentally, unearthed, at, a, level, of, 24, feet, 7, m, from, an, alluvial, tin, mine, young, presented, the, sculptures, to, the, museum, of, the, department, of, mines, in, jos, fifteen, years, later, in, 1943, near, the, village, of, nok, in, the, center, of, nigeria, a, new, series, of, clay, figurines, were, discovered, by, accident, while, mining, tin, a, clerk, in, charge, of, the, mine, had, found, a, head, and, had, taken, it, back, to, his, home, for, use, as, a, scarecrow, a, role, that, it, filled, successfully, for, a, year, in, a, yam, field, this, scarecrow, was, eventually, noticed, by, bernard, fagg, who, at, the, time, was, an, administrative, officer, who, had, studied, archaeology, at, the, university, of, cambridge, fagg, noticed, that, the, head, on, the, scarecrow, looked, similar, to, the, sculpture, that, young, had, found, he, traveled, to, jos, where, young, showed, fagg, other, recently, uncovered, terracotta, figures, eventually, it, became, clear, that, the, tin, mining, in, nok, and, jema, a, areas, was, revealing, and, destroying, archaeological, material, preliminary, excavations, at, the, beginning, of, january, 1961, began, near, a, remote, valley, named, taruga, near, the, village, of, takushara, the, trial, excavations, took, place, during, a, period, of, eight, days, the, finds, included, objects, of, wrought, iron, a, quantity, of, iron, slag, fragments, of, tuyere, pottery, figurine, fragments, red, ocher, quartz, hammer, stones, and, small, concentrations, of, charcoal, the, most, famous, finds, at, the, site, were, the, pottery, graters, which, were, shallow, flat, bottomed, dishes, which, were, deeply, scored, inside, with, diced, patterns, to, produce, a, sharp, abrasive, surface, these, pottery, graters, were, probably, used, for, food, preparation, in, the, preliminary, excavation, a, proton, magnetometer, survey, was, used, to, try, and, locate, furnaces, the, survey, revealed, a, total, of, 61, magnetic, anomalies, which, were, mostly, located, in, a, flat, central, area, which, probably, indicated, the, limits, of, actual, occupation, twenty, of, the, anomalies, revealed, concentrations, of, slag, and, nine, of, them, contained, in, situ, structures, of, furnace, walls, and, bases, the, most, common, type, of, artefact, found, was, domestic, pottery, which, can, be, divided, into, two, different, types, one, type, are, bowls, or, shallow, basins, without, lips, and, the, other, are, globular, pots, which, have, averted, lips, because, of, this, preliminary, excavation, the, nok, culture, would, start, being, regarded, as, belonging, to, the, iron, age, in, 1989, german, scientists, were, working, in, northeastern, nigeria, s, chad, basin, as, part, of, a, cooperative, project, between, the, university, of, maiduguri, located, in, borno, state, nigeria, and, archaeologists, of, goethe, university, frankfurt, this, project, examined, the, beginnings, of, sedentary, farming, societies, in, the, chad, basin, questions, arose, about, whether, there, were, other, societies, like, those, in, the, chad, basin, and, these, questions, led, the, team, to, investigate, the, nok, culture, in, the, early, steps, of, the, frankfurt, nok, project, researchers, had, difficulty, finding, sites, to, excavate, the, team, began, collaborating, with, umaru, yusuf, potiskum, and, they, started, finding, distinct, nok, culture, sites, although, most, were, looted, scientific, field, work, began, in, 2005, to, systematically, investigate, nok, archaeological, sites, and, to, better, understand, nok, terracotta, sculptures, within, their, iron, age, archaeological, context, and, was, subsequently, concluded, in, 2021, the, function, of, nok, terracotta, sculptures, is, still, unknown, for, the, most, part, the, terracotta, is, preserved, in, the, form, of, scattered, fragments, that, is, why, nok, art, is, well, known, today, only, for, the, heads, both, male, and, female, whose, hairstyles, are, particularly, detailed, and, refined, the, statues, are, in, fragments, because, the, discoveries, are, usually, made, from, alluvial, mud, in, terrain, made, by, the, erosion, of, water, the, terracotta, statues, found, there, are, hidden, rolled, polished, and, broken, rarely, are, works, of, great, size, conserved, intact, making, them, highly, valued, on, the, international, art, market, the, terracotta, figures, are, hollow, coil, built, nearly, life, sized, human, heads, and, bodies, that, are, depicted, with, highly, stylized, features, abundant, jewelry, and, varied, postures, because, of, the, homogeneous, composition, of, the, scultptures, across, the, nok, cultural, in, contrast, to, the, varying, compositions, of, nok, pottery, it, is, thought, that, nok, sculpture, was, made, from, a, few, clay, deposits, suggesting, a, centralized, and, specialized, production, little, is, known, of, the, original, function, of, the, pieces, but, theories, include, ancestor, portrayal, grave, markers, and, charms, to, prevent, crop, failure, infertility, and, illness, also, based, on, the, dome, shaped, bases, found, on, several, figures, they, could, have, been, used, as, finials, for, the, roofs, of, ancient, structures, margaret, young, sanchez, associate, curator, of, art, of, the, americas, africa, and, oceania, in, the, cleveland, museum, of, art, explains, that, most, nok, ceramics, were, shaped, by, hand, from, coarse, grained, clay, and, subtractively, sculpted, in, a, manner, that, suggests, an, influence, from, wood, carving, after, some, drying, the, sculptures, were, covered, with, slip, and, burnished, to, produce, a, smooth, glossy, surface, the, figures, are, hollow, with, several, openings, to, facilitate, thorough, drying, and, firing, the, firing, process, most, likely, resembled, that, used, today, in, nigeria, in, which, the, pieces, are, covered, with, grass, twigs, and, leaves, and, burned, for, several, hours, as, a, result, of, natural, erosion, and, deposition, nok, terracottas, were, scattered, at, various, depths, throughout, the, sahel, grasslands, causing, difficulty, in, the, dating, and, classification, of, the, mysterious, artifacts, luckily, two, archaeological, sites, samun, dukiya, and, taruga, were, found, containing, nok, art, that, had, remained, unmoved, radiocarbon, and, thermo, luminescence, tests, dated, the, sculptures, to, a, range, of, dates, between, about, 2, 900, and, 2, 000, years, ago, making, them, some, of, the, oldest, in, western, africa, many, further, dates, were, retrieved, in, the, course, of, new, archaeological, excavations, extending, the, beginnings, of, the, nok, tradition, even, further, back, in, time, because, of, the, similarities, between, the, two, sites, archaeologist, graham, connah, believes, that, nok, artwork, represents, a, style, that, was, adopted, by, a, range, of, iron, using, farming, societies, of, varying, cultures, rather, than, being, the, diagnostic, feature, of, a, particular, human, group, as, has, often, been, claimed, nok, people, may, have, developed, terracotta, sculptures, through, large, scale, economic, production, among, nok, terracotta, sculptures, at, pangwari, there, are, sculptures, portraying, a, large, teeth, bearing, therianthropic, human, feline, figure, and, the, torso, of, a, seated, figure, wearing, a, belt, around, their, waist, and, a, necklace, which, had, added, features, e, g, bows, knots, there, are, also, sculptures, portraying, the, head, of, a, human, figure, that, has, a, bird, beak, and, the, head, of, a, male, figure, with, a, seashell, on, it, which, may, have, been, created, by, the, same, sculptor, additionally, there, are, sculptures, portraying, figures, wielding, slingshots, as, well, as, bows, and, arrows, which, may, be, indicative, of, nok, people, engaging, in, the, hunting, or, trapping, of, untamed, animals, one, nok, sculpture, portrays, two, individuals, along, with, their, goods, in, a, dugout, canoe, both, of, the, anthropomorphic, figures, in, the, watercraft, are, paddling, the, nok, terracotta, depiction, of, a, dugout, canoe, may, indicate, that, nok, people, utilized, dugout, canoes, to, transport, cargo, along, tributaries, e, g, gurara, river, of, the, niger, river, and, exchanged, them, in, a, regional, trade, network, the, nok, terracotta, depiction, of, a, figure, with, a, seashell, on, its, head, may, indicate, that, the, span, of, these, riverine, trade, routes, may, have, extended, to, the, atlantic, coast, in, the, maritime, history, of, africa, there, is, the, earlier, dufuna, canoe, which, was, constructed, approximately, 8000, years, ago, in, the, northern, region, of, nigeria, as, the, second, earliest, form, of, water, vessel, known, in, sub, saharan, africa, the, nok, terracotta, depiction, of, a, dugout, canoe, was, created, in, the, central, region, of, nigeria, during, the, first, millennium, bce, based, on, evidence, from, the, sites, of, nok, archaeological, culture, such, as, considerable, quantities, of, charcoal, layered, among, nok, sculptures, goods, e, g, technically, crafted, ceramics, numerous, stone, beaded, necklaces, found, in, burial, pits, that, support, the, view, of, them, serving, as, grave, sites, difference, in, soil, coloring, of, burial, pits, and, their, immediate, geographic, area, and, burial, pits, containing, materials, from, organic, substances, this, supports, the, conclusion, that, nok, sculptures, were, part, of, a, complex, funerary, culture, excluding, ancient, egyptian, figurative, art, nok, sculptures, are, regarded, to, be, the, most, early, large, figurative, art, in, continental, africa, latter, artistic, traditions, of, west, africa, bura, of, niger, 3rd, century, ce, 10th, century, ce, koma, of, ghana, 7th, century, ce, 15th, century, ce, igbo, ukwu, of, nigeria, 9th, century, ce, 10th, century, ce, jenne, jeno, of, mali, 11th, century, ce, 12th, century, ce, and, ile, ife, of, nigeria, 11th, century, ce, 15th, century, ce, may, have, been, shaped, by, the, earlier, west, african, clay, terracotta, tradition, of, the, nok, culture, in, the, central, region, of, nigeria, nok, archaeological, sites, are, determined, to, be, settlement, sites, on, the, basis, of, archaeological, evidence, discovered, at, the, surface, level, of, the, sites, and, determined, to, be, of, the, nok, culture, on, the, basis, of, the, type, of, archaeological, evidence, discovered, specifically, nok, terracotta, remnants, and, nok, pottery, nok, settlement, sites, have, been, found, in, flat, plains, on, hilltops, and, on, the, slopes, and, summits, of, mountains, there, appears, to, have, been, a, preference, for, specific, topographic, features, like, elevations, and, gentle, slopes, possibly, because, they, provided, favourable, drainage, during, the, rainy, season, in, a, preliminary, study, published, in, 2005, rupp, et, al, stated, that, the, foundation, of, a, wall, had, been, carved, out, of, the, underlying, granite, at, the, settlement, site, of, kochio, and, that, a, megalithic, stone, fence, had, been, erected, around, a, central, area, in, the, settlement, however, in, a, subsequent, study, published, in, 2016, the, authors, concluded, that, these, were, in, fact, misinterpreted, natural, geological, features, and, that, there, was, no, evidence, for, any, stone, architecture, at, nok, sites, apart, from, the, rare, exception, of, the, circular, stone, foundation, of, a, hut, discovered, in, puntun, dutse, the, archaeological, evidence, indicates, that, nok, houses, were, built, primarily, of, organic, materials, like, wood, plant, stalks, grasses, and, animal, hides, which, decomposed, without, leaving, visible, traces, in, the, soil, typical, nok, settlements, were, either, hamlets, or, single, compounds, similar, in, size, to, modern, farmsteads, found, in, the, same, area, there, is, no, indication, of, agglomerations, of, people, above, village, level, thus, no, evidence, that, would, warrant, the, existence, of, communities, of, a, size, that, would, be, necessary, to, develop, social, stratification, which, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, attributes, of, social, complexity, numerous, excavations, and, prospections, have, indicated, that, no, towns, or, any, kind, of, urban, environments, existed, in, the, nok, culture, and, no, evidence, has, been, found, for, special, buildings, or, areas, occupied, by, high, ranking, community, members, the, lack, of, substantial, stratigraphies, or, evidence, of, mound, formation, processes, further, indicates, that, nok, sites, had, brief, occupation, episodes, in, sum, the, evidence, indicates, that, nok, culture, communities, were, small, scaled, and, organised, in, locally, autonomous, groups, according, to, rupp, et, al, 2016, rather, than, attributes, of, social, complexity, like, signs, of, inequality, hierarchy, nucleation, of, settlement, systems, communal, and, public, monuments, or, alternative, african, versions, of, complexity, discussed, in, recent, years, it, has, become, apparent, that, the, nok, culture, no, matter, which, concept, is, followed, developed, complexity, only, in, terms, of, ritual, iron, metallurgy, may, have, developed, in, the, nok, culture, between, 750, bce, and, 550, bce, nok, people, may, have, independently, invented, iron, metallurgy, in, the, 9th, century, bce, or, 8th, century, bce, the, shapes, of, stone, tools, found, at, nok, sites, change, little, throughout, the, entire, span, of, the, nok, culture, what, tends, to, strike, researchers, is, a, lack, of, cutting, tools, apart, from, stone, axes, no, tools, with, a, cutting, edge, have, been, found, projectile, points, made, of, either, iron, or, stone, are, also, absent, from, nok, sites, grinding, tools, are, very, common, at, nok, sites, they, are, rarely, preserved, in, one, piece, but, can, still, illustrate, the, different, shapes, and, sizes, of, tools, used, throughout, the, nok, culture, grinding, stones, were, made, of, quartzite, granitic, or, metamorphic, rock, at, the, site, of, ungwar, kura, grinding, stones, seem, to, have, been, placed, in, a, certain, order, and, at, the, site, of, ido, huge, grinding, slabs, were, arranged, in, an, upright, position, with, pots, and, stone, beads, next, to, them, this, context, is, assumed, to, have, been, ritual, in, some, way, most, of, the, grinders, are, merely, hand, sized, throughout, nok, sites, there, is, an, abundance, of, grinding, slabs, but, there, seems, to, be, a, low, number, of, hand, stones, it, is, possible, that, members, of, the, nok, culture, used, these, grinders, until, they, reached, a, certain, state, of, wear, and, then, repurposed, them, as, pestles, ground, stone, axes, were, another, tool, commonly, used, by, the, nok, they, were, typically, made, from, fine, grained, volcanic, rock, siliceous, rock, is, also, sometimes, seen, and, may, have, been, used, in, food, preparation, these, ax, blades, tend, to, be, smallish, in, size, the, largest, reaching, 20, centimeters, stone, balls, are, found, at, almost, every, nok, site, and, are, approximately, palm, sized, they, were, probably, used, as, hammerstones, or, for, roughening, the, surface, of, a, grinding, stone, not, all, of, them, are, ball, shaped, however, and, many, have, chipping, marks, all, over, or, at, least, in, one, place, these, stone, balls, likely, would, have, served, as, mobile, grinding, stones, stone, rings, have, also, been, found, at, nok, culture, sites, they, are, normally, found, as, fragments, but, can, be, identified, as, rings, because, of, their, flat, oval, or, triangular, cross, sections, and, their, shapes, these, stone, rings, are, very, rare, and, their, purpose, is, unknown, but, their, use, as, currency, or, a, medium, of, exchange, has, been, suggested, another, rare, find, is, stone, beads, which, are, typically, found, as, if, strung, on, strings, beads, tend, to, be, carefully, made, out, of, hard, siliceous, rock, such, as, quartz, chalcedony, jasper, or, carnelian, there, are, three, different, bead, shapes, cylindrical, which, is, the, most, common, shape, as, well, as, rod, and, ring, shaped, potsherds, pottery, shards, are, the, most, abundant, archaeological, artifacts, at, nok, sites, since, 2009, excavated, pottery, has, been, undergoing, systematic, analysis, with, a, central, aim, to, try, and, establish, a, chronology, certain, attributes, of, the, pottery, such, as, decoration, shape, and, size, appear, with, an, increasing, frequency, and, then, disappear, being, replaced, with, different, pottery, attributes, this, change, can, sometimes, allow, one, to, divide, the, progression, into, different, intervals, based, on, the, different, attributes, in, total, approximately, 90, 000, potsherds, have, been, collected, of, which, 15, 000, have, been, considered, diagnostic, meaning, that, they, are, decorated, sherds, from, the, rim, or, the, bottom, of, the, vessel, or, they, have, handles, or, holes, in, them, the, results, of, the, pottery, analysis, can, be, delineated, into, three, distinct, time, periods, early, middle, and, late, from, approximately, c, 1500, 900, bc, the, pottery, of, the, early, nok, period, are, mostly, small, and, not, very, well, preserved, they, seem, to, be, richly, decorated, with, various, elaborate, patterns, directly, below, the, vessels, rims, and, covering, a, large, part, of, the, ceramic, body, the, lines, made, on, the, pottery, seem, to, be, remarkably, fine, or, curving, lines, there, tend, to, be, many, lines, that, are, close, together, and, some, even, have, crisscrossing, lines, beneath, the, rim, pottery, frequently, had, everted, and, broad, thick, rims, the, middle, nok, period, is, approximately, from, c, 900, 300, bc, and, in, this, time, period, there, is, a, dramatic, increase, of, sites, terracotta, fragments, and, iron, objects, instead, of, the, early, period, s, decoration, which, tended, to, cover, most, of, the, pot, instead, there, is, a, decorative, band, which, is, bordered, by, deep, horizontal, lines, this, band, appears, on, the, pots, upper, half, or, directly, under, the, rim, of, the, bowls, some, bands, have, sharp, ends, as, well, as, impressed, zigzag, lines, or, an, incised, wave, or, arc, unlike, the, early, nok, period, the, middle, nok, ceramics, tend, to, have, more, variety, in, the, rim, with, everted, rims, open, bowls, bowls, with, inverted, rims, and, incised, line, ornaments, on, the, rims, lips, the, late, nok, period, is, from, approximately, c, 300, 1, bc, and, has, only, a, few, known, sites, there, is, little, pottery, available, for, analysis, but, from, the, pottery, that, was, found, there, is, a, decrease, in, the, strictness, of, the, ornamental, band, while, bands, are, still, used, they, are, more, complexly, decorated, with, additional, patterning, there, also, tends, to, be, a, returning, pattern, of, body, decoration, the, variety, of, rim, sizes, and, types, seem, to, be, increasing, even, more, than, in, the, middle, nok, period, akin, to, the, peoples, of, the, chad, basin, and, kintampo, culture, the, people, of, the, nok, culture, employed, a, mixed, cropping, method, of, cultivating, cowpeas, and, pearl, millet, as, well, as, utilized, oleaginous, fruits, at, pangwari, pearl, millet, was, domesticated, and, cultivated, cowpeas, were, cultivated, and, various, forms, of, vegetation, e, g, caesalpinioideae, canarium, schweinfurthii, combretaceae, phyllanthaceae, vitex, were, utilized, hunting, gathering, was, another, subsistence, pattern, followed, by, the, nok, people, nok, peoples, may, have, migrated, into, the, central, region, of, nigeria, and, brought, into, the, area, the, agricultural, knowledge, of, cultivating, tamed, pearl, millet, between, 1500, bce, and, 900, bce, at, almost, all, nok, sites, there, are, charred, plant, remains, consisting, of, firewood, and, plant, material, for, cooking, remains, of, pearl, millet, one, of, africa, s, oldest, grain, crops, are, commonly, found, pearl, millet, is, highly, productive, and, resistant, to, adverse, growing, conditions, including, drought, cowpeas, valued, for, their, high, protein, content, are, also, found, at, some, sites, so, far, pearl, millet, and, cowpeas, are, the, only, crops, known, to, have, been, cultivated, by, the, nok, people, it, is, unclear, whether, they, ate, or, farmed, tubers, of, any, kind, the, numerous, grinding, stones, found, at, nok, sites, suggest, that, the, grains, were, ground, into, flour, and, made, into, a, type, of, porridge, hard, pits, from, wild, fruits, have, been, found, at, many, nok, sites, at, some, sites, fruit, and, seeds, of, other, wild, plants, such, as, grasses, and, legumes, were, discovered, overall, there, is, not, a, huge, selection, of, plant, remains, but, this, could, simply, mean, they, were, not, preserved, more, recent, evidence, of, carbonized, plant, remains, of, the, nok, suggest, that, they, foraged, for, tree, fruits, the, nok, people, probably, used, an, agroforestry, system, combining, cultivated, crops, with, useful, trees, on, the, same, plot, of, land, these, plots, are, ecologically, sustainable, and, inter, cropping, of, trees, and, several, cultivated, plant, species, were, common, from, the, savannas, to, the, rain, forest, with, the, origins, of, the, practice, going, back, to, the, first, millennium, bc, right, at, the, time, of, the, nok, culture, most, west, african, trees, are, not, domesticated, but, are, part, of, the, wild, vegetation, which, is, left, after, farmers, clear, their, fields, of, their, crops, because, they, are, left, to, grow, they, multiply, naturally, without, needing, to, be, planted, trees, can, produce, food, medicine, and, animal, feed, because, of, the, acidic, soil, no, animal, bones, from, the, nok, culture, have, been, preserved, leaving, no, direct, evidence, of, what, species, they, might, have, domesticated, or, hunted, the, only, evidence, for, animals, during, the, nok, culture, period, is, the, depictions, of, animals, as, figurines, or, terracotta, sculptures, as, of, 3500, years, ago, nok, agriculturalists, gathered, and, utilized, bee, products, e, g, gathered, honey, in, pottery, the, honey, may, have, been, utilized, by, nok, agriculturalists, to, add, to, west, african, cuisines, as, evidenced, by, remnants, of, beeswax, and, fats, from, animals, on, ceramics, the, pottery, may, have, been, utilized, to, store, meat, along, with, honey, utilized, for, preservation, purposes, as, part, of, nok, traditional, medicine, nok, ceramics, may, have, been, used, to, process, roots, and, bark, as, medicinal, plants, for, the, production, of, medicinal, decoctions, since, the, 1970s, nok, terracotta, figures, have, been, heavily, looted, even, larger, scale, looting, commenced, in, the, nok, cultural, area, in, 1994, and, by, 1995, two, main, local, traders, emerged, each, of, the, main, traders, could, employ, approximately, 1, 000, diggers, to, unearth, terracottas, every, day, although, the, majority, of, the, terracottas, were, fragmented, some, were, intact, and, sellable, because, of, this, hundreds, of, nok, culture, sites, have, been, illegally, dug, in, search, of, these, terracotta, sculptures, valuable, information, about, the, nok, culture, is, lost, when, these, objects, are, taken, from, out, of, the, ground, and, removed, from, their, archaeological, contexts, in, 1979, nigeria, s, national, commission, of, museums, and, monuments, decree, established, the, national, commission, for, museums, and, monuments, ncmm, which, is, used, to, manage, nigeria, s, cultural, heritage, ncmm, decree, number, 77, made, it, illegal, for, anyone, other, than, authorized, personnel, to, buy, or, sell, antiquities, within, nigeria, or, export, an, antiquity, without, a, permit, from, the, ncmm, towards, the, end, of, the, 1990s, the, federal, government, of, nigeria, implemented, the, ncmm, which, initiated, a, series, of, actions, to, work, out, strategies, for, combating, the, problems, of, looting, and, to, map, out, a, plan, of, action, the, general, consensus, was, that, laws, governing, antiquities, and, penalties, for, offenders, needed, to, be, strictly, enforced, and, that, all, archaeological, sites, should, be, monitored, the, ncmm, also, recommended, more, aggressive, public, enlightenment, campaigns, as, well, as, a, series, of, sensitization, programs, across, the, nation, these, programs, are, considered, a, success, in, terms, of, increased, awareness, by, law, enforcement, agents, as, well, as, the, nigerian, customs, authorities, and, interpol, however, not, all, of, the, recommendations, were, implemented, because, the, nigerian, government, did, not, have, the, resources, to, face, the, large, scale, of, some, of, the, challenges, for, example, the, government, did, not, have, the, resources, to, place, monitors, at, all, archaeological, sites, and, terracotta, figures, still, slip, through, nigeria, s, borders, today, the, terracotta, sculptures, are, very, highly, sought, after, on, the, international, art, market, and, so, artifacts, continue, to, be, dug, up, without, documentation, of, the, contexts, in, which, they, were, buried, a, lack, of, extensive, archaeological, study, has, also, severely, limited, our, understanding, of, the, nok, cultures, a, joint, research, project, with, goethe, university, and, the, national, commission, for, museums, and, monuments, conducted, since, 2005, showed, that, more, than, 90, of, nok, culture, sites, known, in, the, research, area, have, been, illegally, looted, art, historical, studies, carried, out, shows, that, over, 1, 000, nok, terracotta, sculptures, have, been, illegally, excavated, and, smuggled, into, europe, the, usa, japan, and, elsewhere, in, february, 2013, daily, trust, reported, that, the, nigerian, federal, ministry, of, information, and, national, orientation, repossessed, five, nok, statuettes, looted, by, a, french, thief, in, august, 2010, the, pieces, had, been, seized, by, french, customs, agents, and, were, repatriated, following, a, nigerian, government, directive, what, further, complicates, the, problem, are, the, many, workshops, which, fake, nok, sculptures, and, then, put, them, on, the, market, as, authentic, as, each, share, cultural, and, artistic, similarity, with, the, nok, culture, found, in, nok, sokoto, and, katsina, the, niger, congo, speaking, yoruba, jukun, or, dakakari, peoples, may, be, descendants, of, the, nok, peoples, based, on, stylistic, similarities, with, the, nok, terracottas, the, bronze, figurines, of, the, yoruba, ife, empire, and, the, bini, kingdom, of, benin, may, also, be, continuations, of, the, traditions, of, the, earlier, nok, culture
