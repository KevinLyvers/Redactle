western, zhou, period, c, 1046, 771, bc, the, royal, house, surnamed, ji, had, military, control, over, ancient, china, even, as, zhou, suzerainty, became, increasingly, ceremonial, over, the, following, eastern, zhou, period, 771, 256, bc, the, political, system, created, by, the, zhou, royal, house, survived, in, some, form, for, several, additional, centuries, a, date, of, 1046, bc, for, the, zhou, s, establishment, is, supported, by, the, xia, shang, zhou, chronology, project, and, david, pankenier, but, david, nivison, and, edward, l, shaughnessy, date, the, establishment, to, 1045, bc, the, latter, eastern, zhou, period, is, itself, roughly, subdivided, into, two, parts, during, the, spring, and, autumn, period, c, 771, c, 481, bc, power, became, increasingly, decentralized, as, the, authority, of, the, royal, house, diminished, the, warring, states, period, c, 481, 221, bc, that, followed, saw, large, scale, warfare, and, consolidation, among, what, had, formerly, been, zhou, client, states, until, the, zhou, were, formally, extinguished, by, the, state, of, qin, in, 256, bc, the, qin, ultimately, founded, the, imperial, qin, dynasty, in, 221, bc, after, conquering, all, of, china, the, zhou, period, is, often, considered, to, be, the, zenith, for, the, craft, of, chinese, bronzeware, the, latter, zhou, period, is, also, famous, for, the, advent, of, three, major, chinese, philosophies, confucianism, taoism, and, legalism, the, zhou, dynasty, also, spans, the, period, when, the, predominant, form, of, written, chinese, became, seal, script, which, evolved, from, the, earlier, oracle, bone, and, bronze, scripts, by, the, dynasty, s, end, an, immature, form, of, clerical, script, had, also, emerged, according, to, chinese, mythology, the, zhou, lineage, began, when, jiang, yuan, a, consort, of, the, legendary, emperor, ku, miraculously, conceived, a, child, qi, the, abandoned, one, after, stepping, into, the, divine, footprint, of, shangdi, qi, was, a, culture, hero, credited, with, surviving, abandonment, by, his, mother, three, times, and, with, greatly, improving, agriculture, to, the, point, where, he, was, granted, lordship, over, tai, the, surname, ji, and, the, title, houji, lord, of, millet, by, the, emperor, shun, he, even, received, sacrifice, as, a, harvest, god, the, term, houji, was, probably, a, hereditary, title, attached, to, a, lineage, buzhu, qi, s, son, or, rather, that, of, the, houji, is, said, to, have, abandoned, his, position, as, agrarian, master, n, ngsh, in, old, age, and, either, he, or, his, son, ju, abandoned, their, tradition, living, in, the, manner, of, the, xirong, and, rongdi, see, hua, yi, distinction, ju, s, son, liu, however, led, his, people, to, prosperity, by, restoring, agriculture, and, settling, them, at, a, place, called, bin, which, his, descendants, ruled, for, generations, tai, later, led, the, clan, from, bin, to, zhou, an, area, in, the, wei, river, valley, modern, qishan, county, the, duke, passed, over, his, two, elder, sons, taibo, and, zhongyong, to, favor, the, younger, jili, a, warrior, in, his, own, right, as, a, vassal, of, the, shang, kings, wu, yi, and, wen, ding, jili, went, to, conquer, several, xirong, tribes, before, being, treacherously, killed, by, shang, forces, taibo, and, zhongyong, had, supposedly, already, fled, to, the, yangtze, delta, where, they, established, the, state, of, wu, among, the, tribes, there, jili, s, son, wen, bribed, his, way, out, of, imprisonment, and, moved, the, zhou, capital, to, feng, present, day, xi, an, around, 1046, bc, wen, s, son, wu, and, his, ally, jiang, ziya, led, an, army, of, 45, 000, men, and, 300, chariots, across, the, yellow, river, and, defeated, king, zhou, of, shang, at, the, battle, of, muye, marking, the, beginning, of, the, zhou, dynasty, the, zhou, enfeoffed, a, member, of, the, defeated, shang, royal, family, as, the, duke, of, song, which, was, held, by, descendants, of, the, shang, royal, family, until, its, end, this, practice, was, referred, to, as, two, kings, three, reverences, according, to, nicholas, bodman, the, zhou, appear, to, have, spoken, a, language, largely, similar, in, vocabulary, and, syntax, to, that, of, the, shang, a, recent, study, by, david, mccraw, using, lexical, statistics, reached, the, same, conclusion, the, zhou, emulated, shang, cultural, practices, possibly, to, legitimize, their, own, rule, and, became, the, successors, to, shang, culture, at, the, same, time, the, zhou, may, also, have, been, connected, to, the, xirong, a, broadly, defined, cultural, group, to, the, west, of, the, shang, which, the, shang, regarded, as, tributaries, for, example, the, philosopher, mencius, 372, 289, bc, acknowledged, that, king, wen, of, zhou, had, ancestry, from, among, the, xirong, as, king, wen, s, descendants, the, zhou, kings, claimed, descent, from, hou, ji, a, legendary, culture, hero, possibly, related, to, the, xirong, through, his, mother, jiang, yuan, additionally, the, late, 4th, century, bc, zuo, zhuan, comments, that, the, baron, of, li, rong, after, being, defeated, by, jin, married, his, daughter, li, ji, off, according, to, historian, li, feng, the, term, rong, during, the, western, zhou, period, was, likely, used, to, designate, political, and, military, adversaries, rather, than, cultural, and, ethnic, others, cultural, artifacts, of, the, western, rong, coexisted, with, western, zhou, bronzes, indicating, close, bonds, between, the, rong, and, the, western, zhou, during, the, western, zhou, 1045, 771, bc, king, wu, maintained, the, old, capital, for, ceremonial, purposes, but, constructed, a, new, one, for, his, palace, and, administration, nearby, at, haojing, although, wu, s, early, death, left, a, young, and, inexperienced, heir, the, duke, of, zhou, assisted, his, nephew, king, cheng, in, consolidating, royal, power, wary, of, the, duke, of, zhou, s, increasing, power, the, three, guards, zhou, princes, stationed, on, the, eastern, plain, rose, in, rebellion, against, his, regency, even, though, they, garnered, the, support, of, independent, minded, nobles, shang, partisans, and, several, dongyi, tribes, the, duke, of, zhou, quelled, the, rebellion, and, further, expanded, the, zhou, kingdom, into, the, east, to, maintain, zhou, authority, over, its, greatly, expanded, territory, and, prevent, other, revolts, he, set, up, the, fengjian, system, furthermore, he, countered, zhou, s, crisis, of, legitimacy, by, expounding, the, doctrine, of, the, mandate, of, heaven, while, accommodating, important, shang, rituals, at, wangcheng, and, chengzhou, over, time, this, decentralized, system, became, strained, as, the, familial, relationships, between, the, zhou, kings, and, the, regional, dynasties, thinned, over, the, generations, peripheral, territories, developed, local, power, and, prestige, on, par, with, that, of, the, zhou, the, conflicts, with, nomadic, tribes, from, the, north, and, the, northwest, variously, known, as, the, xianyun, guifang, or, various, rong, tribes, such, as, the, xirong, shanrong, or, quanrong, intensified, towards, the, end, of, the, western, zhou, period, these, tribes, are, recorded, as, harassing, zhou, territory, but, at, the, time, the, zhou, were, expanding, northwards, encroaching, on, their, traditional, lands, especially, the, wei, river, valley, archaeologically, the, zhou, expanded, to, the, north, and, the, northwest, at, the, expense, of, the, siwa, culture, when, king, you, demoted, and, exiled, his, jiang, queen, in, favor, of, the, commoner, bao, si, the, disgraced, queen, s, father, the, marquis, of, shen, joined, with, zeng, and, the, quanrong, the, quanrong, put, an, end, to, the, western, zhou, in, 771, bc, sacking, the, zhou, capital, at, haojing, and, killing, the, last, western, zhou, king, you, with, king, you, dead, a, conclave, of, nobles, met, at, shen, and, declared, the, marquis, s, grandson, king, ping, the, capital, was, moved, eastward, to, wangcheng, marking, the, beginning, of, the, eastern, zhou, period, the, eastern, zhou, period, 771, 256, bc, was, characterized, by, an, accelerating, collapse, of, royal, authority, although, the, king, s, ritual, importance, enabled, more, than, five, additional, centuries, of, rule, the, spring, and, autumn, annals, the, confucian, chronicle, of, the, early, years, of, this, process, gave, the, period, its, name, as, the, spring, and, autumn, period, the, partition, of, jin, during, the, mid, 5th, century, bc, is, a, commonly, cited, as, initiating, the, subsequent, warring, states, period, in, 403, bc, the, zhou, court, recognized, han, zhao, and, wei, as, fully, independent, states, in, 344, duke, hui, of, wei, was, the, first, to, claim, the, title, of, king, for, himself, others, followed, marking, a, turning, point, as, rulers, did, not, even, entertain, the, pretense, of, vassalage, of, the, zhou, court, instead, proclaiming, themselves, fully, independent, kingdoms, a, series, of, states, rose, to, prominence, before, each, falling, in, turn, and, in, most, of, these, conflicts, zhou, was, a, minor, player, the, last, zhou, king, is, traditionally, taken, to, be, nan, who, was, killed, when, qin, captured, wangcheng, in, 256, bc, duke, wen, of, eastern, zhou, declared, himself, to, be, king, hui, was, declared, but, his, splinter, state, was, fully, disassembled, by, 249, qin, s, wars, of, unification, concluded, in, 221, bc, with, qin, shi, huang, s, annexation, of, qi, the, eastern, zhou, is, also, remembered, as, the, golden, age, of, chinese, philosophy, the, hundred, schools, of, thought, which, flourished, as, rival, lords, patronized, itinerant, scholars, is, led, by, the, example, of, qi, s, jixia, academy, the, nine, schools, of, thought, which, came, to, dominate, the, others, were, confucianism, as, interpreted, by, mencius, and, others, legalism, taoism, mohism, the, utopian, communalist, agriculturalism, two, strains, of, the, school, of, diplomacy, the, school, of, names, sun, tzu, s, school, of, the, military, and, the, school, of, naturalists, while, only, the, first, three, of, these, would, receive, imperial, patronage, in, later, dynasties, doctrines, from, each, influenced, the, others, and, chinese, society, in, sometimes, unusual, ways, the, mohists, for, instance, found, little, interest, in, their, praise, of, meritocracy, but, much, acceptance, for, their, mastery, of, defensive, siege, warfare, much, later, however, their, arguments, against, nepotism, were, used, in, favor, of, establishing, the, imperial, examination, system, the, zhou, heartland, was, the, wei, river, valley, this, remained, their, primary, base, of, power, after, conquering, the, shang, zhou, rulers, introduced, the, mandate, of, heaven, which, would, prove, to, be, among, east, asia, s, most, enduring, political, doctrines, according, to, the, theory, heaven, imposed, a, mandate, to, replace, the, shang, on, the, zhou, whose, moral, superiority, justified, seizing, shang, wealth, and, territory, in, order, to, return, good, governance, to, the, people, the, mandate, of, heaven, was, presented, as, a, religious, compact, between, the, zhou, people, and, their, supreme, god, in, heaven, the, zhou, agreed, that, since, worldly, affairs, were, supposed, to, align, with, those, of, the, heavens, the, heavens, conferred, legitimate, power, on, only, one, person, the, zhou, ruler, in, return, the, ruler, was, duty, bound, to, uphold, heaven, s, principles, of, harmony, and, honor, any, ruler, who, failed, in, this, duty, who, let, instability, creep, into, earthly, affairs, or, who, let, his, people, suffer, would, lose, the, mandate, under, this, system, it, was, the, prerogative, of, spiritual, authority, to, withdraw, support, from, any, wayward, ruler, and, to, find, another, more, worthy, one, in, this, way, the, zhou, sky, god, legitimized, regime, change, in, using, this, creed, the, zhou, rulers, had, to, acknowledge, that, any, group, of, rulers, even, they, themselves, could, be, ousted, if, they, lost, the, mandate, of, heaven, because, of, improper, practices, the, book, of, odes, written, during, the, zhou, period, clearly, intoned, this, caution, the, zhou, kings, contended, that, heaven, favored, their, triumph, because, the, last, shang, kings, had, been, evil, men, whose, policies, brought, pain, to, the, people, through, waste, and, corruption, after, the, zhou, came, to, power, the, mandate, became, a, political, tool, one, of, the, duties, and, privileges, of, the, king, was, to, create, a, royal, calendar, this, official, document, defined, times, for, undertaking, agricultural, activities, and, celebrating, rituals, but, unexpected, events, such, as, solar, eclipses, or, natural, calamities, threw, the, ruling, house, s, mandate, into, question, since, rulers, claimed, that, their, authority, came, from, heaven, the, zhou, made, great, efforts, to, gain, accurate, knowledge, of, the, stars, and, to, perfect, the, astronomical, system, on, which, they, based, their, calendar, zhou, legitimacy, also, arose, indirectly, from, shang, material, culture, through, the, use, of, bronze, ritual, vessels, statues, ornaments, and, weapons, as, the, zhou, emulated, the, shang, s, large, scale, production, of, ceremonial, bronzes, they, developed, an, extensive, system, of, bronze, metalworking, that, required, a, large, force, of, tribute, labor, many, of, its, members, were, shang, who, were, sometimes, forcibly, transported, to, new, zhou, to, produce, the, bronze, ritual, objects, which, were, then, sold, and, distributed, across, the, lands, symbolizing, zhou, legitimacy, western, writers, often, describe, the, zhou, period, as, feudal, because, the, zhou, s, fengjian, system, invites, comparison, with, european, political, systems, during, the, middle, ages, there, were, many, similarities, between, the, decentralized, systems, when, the, dynasty, was, established, the, conquered, land, was, divided, into, hereditary, fiefs, zh, h, u, that, eventually, became, powerful, in, their, own, right, in, matters, of, inheritance, the, zhou, dynasty, recognized, only, patrilineal, primogeniture, as, legal, according, to, hsi, sheng, tao, the, tsung, fa, or, descent, line, system, has, the, following, characteristics, patrilineal, descent, patrilineal, succession, patriarchate, sib, exogamy, and, primogeniture, the, system, also, called, extensive, stratified, patrilineage, was, defined, by, the, anthropologist, kwang, chih, chang, as, characterized, by, the, fact, that, the, eldest, son, of, each, generation, formed, the, main, of, line, descent, and, political, authority, whereas, the, younger, brothers, were, moved, out, to, establish, new, lineages, of, lesser, authority, the, farther, removed, the, lesser, the, political, authority, ebrey, defines, the, descent, line, system, as, follows, a, great, line, ta, tsung, is, the, line, of, eldest, sons, continuing, indefinitely, from, a, founding, ancestor, a, lesser, line, is, the, line, of, younger, sons, going, back, no, more, than, five, generations, great, lines, and, lesser, lines, continually, spin, off, new, lesser, lines, founded, by, younger, sons, k, e, brashier, writes, in, his, book, ancestral, memory, in, early, china, about, the, tsung, fa, system, of, patrilineal, primogeniture, the, greater, lineage, if, it, has, survived, is, the, direct, succession, from, father, to, eldest, son, and, is, not, defined, via, the, collateral, shifts, of, the, lesser, lineages, in, discussions, that, demarcate, between, trunk, and, collateral, lines, the, former, is, called, a, zong, and, the, latter, a, zu, whereas, the, whole, lineage, is, dubbed, the, shi, on, one, hand, every, son, who, is, not, the, eldest, and, hence, not, heir, to, the, lineage, territory, has, the, potential, of, becoming, a, progenitor, and, fostering, a, new, trunk, lineage, ideally, he, would, strike, out, to, cultivate, new, lineage, territory, according, to, the, zou, commentary, the, son, of, heaven, divided, land, among, his, feudal, lords, his, feudal, lords, divided, the, land, among, their, dependent, families, and, so, forth, down, the, pecking, order, to, the, officers, who, had, their, dependent, kin, and, the, commoners, who, each, had, his, apportioned, relations, and, all, had, their, graded, precedence, this, type, of, unilineal, descent, group, later, became, the, model, of, the, korean, family, through, the, influence, of, neo, confucianism, as, zhu, xi, and, others, advocated, its, re, establishment, in, china, there, were, five, peerage, ranks, below, the, royal, ranks, in, descending, order, with, common, english, translations, g, ng, duke, h, u, marquis, b, count, z, viscount, and, n, n, baron, at, times, a, vigorous, duke, would, take, power, from, his, nobles, and, centralize, the, state, centralization, became, more, necessary, as, the, states, began, to, war, among, themselves, and, decentralization, encouraged, more, war, if, a, duke, took, power, from, his, nobles, the, state, would, have, to, be, administered, bureaucratically, by, appointed, officials, despite, these, similarities, there, are, a, number, of, important, differences, from, medieval, europe, one, obvious, difference, is, that, the, zhou, ruled, from, walled, cities, rather, than, castles, another, was, china, s, distinct, class, system, which, lacked, an, organized, clergy, but, saw, shang, descent, yeomen, become, masters, of, ritual, and, ceremony, as, well, as, astronomy, state, affairs, and, ancient, canons, known, as, ru, when, a, dukedom, was, centralized, these, people, would, find, employment, as, government, officials, or, officers, these, hereditary, classes, were, similar, to, western, knights, in, status, and, breeding, but, unlike, the, european, equivalent, they, were, expected, to, be, something, of, a, scholar, instead, of, a, warrior, being, appointed, they, could, move, from, one, state, to, another, some, would, travel, from, state, to, state, peddling, schemes, of, administrative, or, military, reform, those, who, could, not, find, employment, would, often, end, up, teaching, young, men, who, aspired, to, official, status, the, most, famous, of, these, was, confucius, who, taught, a, system, of, mutual, duty, between, superiors, and, inferiors, in, contrast, the, legalists, had, no, time, for, confucian, virtue, and, advocated, a, system, of, strict, laws, and, harsh, punishments, agriculture, in, the, zhou, dynasty, was, very, intensive, and, in, many, cases, directed, by, the, government, all, farming, lands, were, owned, by, nobles, who, then, gave, their, land, to, their, serfs, a, situation, similar, to, european, feudalism, for, example, a, piece, of, land, was, divided, into, nine, squares, in, the, well, field, system, with, the, grain, from, the, middle, square, taken, by, the, government, and, that, of, surrounding, squares, kept, by, individual, farmers, this, way, the, government, was, able, to, store, surplus, food, and, distribute, it, in, times, of, famine, or, bad, harvest, some, important, manufacturing, sectors, during, this, period, included, bronze, smelting, which, was, integral, to, making, weapons, and, farming, tools, again, these, industries, were, dominated, by, the, nobility, who, directed, the, production, of, such, materials, china, s, first, projects, of, hydraulic, engineering, were, initiated, during, the, zhou, dynasty, ultimately, as, a, means, to, aid, agricultural, irrigation, sunshu, ao, the, chancellor, of, wei, who, served, king, zhuang, of, chu, dammed, a, river, to, create, an, enormous, irrigation, reservoir, in, modern, day, northern, anhui, province, for, this, sunshu, is, credited, as, china, s, first, hydraulic, engineer, the, later, wei, statesman, ximen, bao, who, served, marquis, wen, of, wei, 445, 396, bc, was, the, first, hydraulic, engineer, of, china, to, have, created, a, large, irrigation, canal, system, as, the, main, focus, of, his, grandiose, project, his, canal, work, eventually, diverted, the, waters, of, the, entire, zhang, river, to, a, spot, further, up, the, yellow, river, the, early, western, zhou, supported, a, strong, army, split, into, two, major, units, the, six, armies, of, the, west, and, the, eight, armies, of, chengzhou, the, armies, campaigned, in, the, northern, loess, plateau, modern, ningxia, and, the, yellow, river, floodplain, the, military, prowess, of, zhou, peaked, during, the, 19th, year, of, king, zhao, s, reign, when, the, six, armies, were, wiped, out, along, with, king, zhao, on, a, campaign, around, the, han, river, early, zhou, kings, were, true, commanders, in, chief, king, zhao, was, famous, for, repeated, campaigns, in, the, yangtze, region, and, died, on, campaign, later, kings, campaigns, were, less, effective, king, li, led, 14, armies, against, barbarians, in, the, south, but, failed, to, achieve, any, victory, king, xuan, fought, the, quanrong, nomads, in, vain, king, you, was, killed, by, the, quanrong, when, haojing, was, sacked, although, chariots, had, been, introduced, to, china, during, the, shang, dynasty, from, central, asia, the, zhou, period, saw, the, first, major, use, of, chariots, in, battle, recent, archaeological, finds, demonstrate, similarities, between, horse, burials, of, the, shang, and, zhou, dynasties, with, the, steppe, populations, in, the, west, such, as, the, saka, and, wusun, other, possible, cultural, influences, resulting, from, contact, with, these, iranic, people, of, central, asia, in, this, period, may, include, fighting, styles, head, and, hooves, burials, art, motifs, and, myths, the, zhou, army, also, included, barbarian, troops, such, as, the, di, people, king, hui, of, zhou, married, a, princess, of, the, red, di, as, a, sign, of, appreciation, for, the, importance, of, the, di, troops, king, xiang, of, zhou, also, married, a, di, princess, after, receiving, di, military, support, during, the, zhou, dynasty, the, origins, of, native, chinese, philosophy, developed, its, initial, stages, of, development, beginning, in, the, 6th, century, bc, the, greatest, chinese, philosophers, those, who, made, the, greatest, impact, on, later, generations, of, chinese, were, confucius, founder, of, confucianism, and, laozi, founder, of, taoism, other, philosophers, of, this, era, were, mozi, founder, of, mohism, mencius, the, second, sage, of, confucianism, shang, yang, and, han, fei, responsible, for, the, development, of, ancient, chinese, legalism, and, xunzi, who, was, arguably, the, center, of, ancient, chinese, intellectual, life, during, his, time, the, state, theology, of, the, zhou, dynasty, used, concepts, from, the, shang, dynasty, and, mostly, referred, to, the, shang, god, di, as, tian, a, more, distant, and, unknowable, concept, yet, one, that, anyone, could, utilize, the, opposite, view, of, the, shang, s, spirituality, the, zhou, wanted, to, increase, the, number, of, enlightenment, seekers, mystics, and, those, who, would, be, interested, in, learning, about, such, things, as, a, way, to, further, distance, their, people, from, the, shang, era, paradigm, and, local, traditions, having, emerged, during, the, western, zhou, the, li, ritual, system, encoded, an, understanding, of, manners, as, an, expression, of, the, social, hierarchy, ethics, and, regulation, concerning, material, life, the,
