the, congo, free, state, also, known, as, the, independent, state, of, the, congo, french, tat, ind, pendant, du, congo, was, a, large, state, and, absolute, monarchy, in, central, africa, from, 1885, to, 1908, it, was, privately, owned, by, king, leopold, ii, the, constitutional, monarch, of, the, kingdom, of, belgium, in, legal, terms, the, two, separate, countries, were, in, a, personal, union, the, congo, free, state, was, not, a, part, of, nor, did, it, belong, to, belgium, leopold, was, able, to, seize, the, region, by, convincing, other, european, states, at, the, berlin, conference, on, africa, that, he, was, involved, in, humanitarian, and, philanthropic, work, and, would, not, tax, trade, via, the, international, association, of, the, congo, he, was, able, to, lay, claim, to, most, of, the, congo, basin, on, 29, may, 1885, after, the, closure, of, the, berlin, conference, the, king, announced, that, he, planned, to, name, his, possessions, the, congo, free, state, an, appellation, which, was, not, yet, used, at, the, berlin, conference, and, which, officially, replaced, international, association, of, the, congo, on, 1, august, 1885, the, free, state, was, privately, controlled, by, leopold, from, brussels, he, never, visited, it, the, state, included, the, entire, area, of, the, present, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, and, existed, from, 1885, to, 1908, when, the, belgian, parliament, reluctantly, annexed, the, state, as, a, colony, belonging, to, belgium, after, international, pressure, leopold, s, reign, in, the, congo, eventually, earned, infamy, on, account, of, the, atrocities, perpetrated, on, the, locals, ostensibly, the, congo, free, state, aimed, to, bring, civilization, to, the, local, people, and, to, develop, the, region, economically, in, reality, leopold, ii, s, administration, extracted, ivory, rubber, and, minerals, from, the, upper, congo, basin, for, sale, on, the, world, market, through, a, series, of, international, concessionary, companies, that, brought, little, benefit, to, the, area, under, leopold, s, administration, the, free, state, became, one, of, the, greatest, international, scandals, of, the, early, 20th, century, the, casement, report, of, the, british, consul, roger, casement, led, to, the, arrest, and, punishment, of, officials, who, had, been, responsible, for, killings, during, a, rubber, collecting, expedition, in, 1903, the, loss, of, life, and, atrocities, inspired, literature, such, as, joseph, conrad, s, novel, heart, of, darkness, and, raised, an, international, outcry, debate, has, been, ongoing, about, the, high, death, rate, in, this, period, the, highest, estimates, state, that, the, widespread, use, of, forced, labour, torture, and, murder, led, to, the, deaths, of, 50, per, cent, of, the, population, in, the, rubber, provinces, the, lack, of, accurate, records, makes, it, difficult, to, quantify, the, number, of, deaths, caused, by, the, exploitation, and, the, lack, of, immunity, to, new, diseases, introduced, by, contact, with, european, colonists, during, the, congo, free, state, propaganda, war, european, and, us, reformers, exposed, atrocities, in, the, congo, free, state, to, the, public, through, the, congo, reform, association, founded, by, casement, and, the, journalist, author, and, politician, e, d, morel, also, active, in, exposing, the, activities, of, the, congo, free, state, was, the, author, arthur, conan, doyle, whose, book, the, crime, of, the, congo, was, widely, read, in, the, early, 1900s, by, 1908, public, pressure, and, diplomatic, manoeuvres, led, to, the, end, of, leopold, ii, s, absolutist, rule, the, belgian, parliament, annexed, the, congo, free, state, as, a, colony, of, belgium, it, became, known, thereafter, as, the, belgian, congo, in, addition, a, number, of, major, belgian, investment, companies, pushed, the, belgian, government, to, take, over, the, congo, and, develop, the, mining, sector, as, it, was, virtually, untapped, diogo, c, o, travelled, around, the, mouth, of, the, congo, river, in, 1482, leading, portugal, to, claim, the, region, until, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, the, congo, was, at, the, heart, of, independent, africa, as, european, colonialists, seldom, entered, the, interior, along, with, fierce, local, resistance, the, rainforest, swamps, malaria, sleeping, sickness, and, other, diseases, made, it, a, difficult, environment, for, europeans, to, settle, western, states, were, at, first, reluctant, to, colonize, the, area, in, the, absence, of, obvious, economic, benefits, in, 1876, leopold, ii, of, belgium, hosted, the, brussels, geographic, conference, inviting, famous, explorers, philanthropists, and, members, of, geographic, societies, to, stir, up, interest, in, a, humanitarian, endeavour, for, europeans, in, central, africa, to, improve, and, civilize, the, lives, of, the, indigenous, peoples, at, the, conference, leopold, organized, the, international, african, association, with, the, cooperation, of, european, and, american, explorers, and, the, support, of, several, european, governments, and, was, himself, elected, chairman, leopold, used, the, association, to, promote, plans, to, seize, independent, central, africa, under, this, philanthropic, guise, henry, morton, stanley, famous, for, making, contact, with, british, missionary, david, livingstone, in, africa, in, 1871, explored, the, region, in, 1876, 1877, a, journey, that, was, described, in, stanley, s, 1878, book, through, the, dark, continent, failing, to, enlist, british, interest, in, the, congo, region, stanley, took, up, service, with, leopold, ii, who, hired, him, to, help, gain, a, foothold, in, the, region, and, annex, the, region, for, himself, from, august, 1879, to, june, 1884, stanley, was, in, the, congo, basin, where, he, built, a, road, from, the, lower, congo, up, to, stanley, pool, and, launched, steamers, on, the, upper, river, while, exploring, the, congo, for, leopold, stanley, set, up, treaties, with, the, local, chiefs, and, with, native, leaders, in, essence, the, documents, gave, over, all, rights, of, their, respective, pieces, of, land, to, leopold, with, stanley, s, help, leopold, was, able, to, claim, a, great, area, along, the, congo, river, and, military, posts, were, established, christian, de, bonchamps, a, french, explorer, who, served, leopold, in, katanga, expressed, attitudes, towards, such, treaties, shared, by, many, europeans, saying, the, treaties, with, these, little, african, tyrants, which, generally, consist, of, four, long, pages, of, which, they, do, not, understand, a, word, and, to, which, they, sign, a, cross, in, order, to, have, peace, and, to, receive, gifts, are, really, only, serious, matters, for, the, european, powers, in, the, event, of, disputes, over, the, territories, they, do, not, concern, the, black, sovereign, who, signs, them, for, a, moment, leopold, began, to, create, a, plan, to, convince, other, european, powers, of, the, legitimacy, of, his, claim, to, the, region, all, the, while, maintaining, the, guise, that, his, work, was, for, the, benefit, of, the, native, peoples, under, the, name, of, a, philanthropic, association, the, king, launched, a, publicity, campaign, in, britain, to, distract, critics, drawing, attention, to, portugal, s, record, of, slavery, and, offering, to, drive, slave, traders, from, the, congo, basin, he, also, secretly, told, british, merchant, houses, that, if, he, was, given, formal, control, of, the, congo, for, this, and, other, humanitarian, purposes, he, would, then, give, them, the, same, most, favoured, nation, mfn, status, portugal, had, offered, them, at, the, same, time, leopold, promised, bismarck, he, would, not, give, any, one, nation, special, status, and, that, german, traders, would, be, as, welcome, as, any, other, i, do, not, want, to, risk, losing, a, fine, chance, to, secure, for, ourselves, a, slice, of, this, magnificent, african, cake, king, leopold, ii, to, an, aide, in, london, leopold, then, offered, france, the, support, of, the, association, for, french, ownership, of, the, entire, northern, bank, of, the, congo, and, sweetened, the, deal, by, proposing, that, if, his, personal, wealth, proved, insufficient, to, hold, the, entire, congo, as, seemed, utterly, inevitable, that, it, should, revert, to, france, on, 23, april, 1884, the, international, association, s, claim, on, the, southern, congo, basin, was, formally, recognized, by, france, on, condition, that, the, french, got, the, first, option, to, buy, the, territory, if, the, association, decided, to, sell, this, may, also, have, helped, leopold, to, gain, recognition, for, his, claim, by, the, other, major, powers, who, thus, wanted, him, to, succeed, instead, of, selling, his, claims, to, france, he, also, enlisted, the, aid, of, the, united, states, sending, president, chester, a, arthur, carefully, edited, copies, of, the, cloth, and, trinket, treaties, that, stanley, a, welsh, american, claimed, to, have, negotiated, with, various, local, authorities, and, proposing, that, as, an, entirely, disinterested, humanitarian, body, the, association, would, administer, the, congo, for, the, good, of, all, handing, over, power, to, the, natives, as, soon, as, they, were, ready, for, that, responsibility, leopold, wanted, to, have, the, united, states, support, his, plans, for, the, congo, in, order, to, gain, support, from, the, european, nations, he, had, help, from, american, businessman, henry, shelton, sanford, who, had, recruited, stanley, for, leopold, henry, sanford, swayed, president, arthur, by, inviting, him, to, stay, as, his, guest, at, sanford, house, hotel, on, lake, monroe, while, he, was, in, belgium, on, 29, november, 1883, during, his, meeting, with, the, president, as, leopold, s, envoy, he, convinced, the, president, that, leopold, s, agenda, was, similar, to, the, united, states, involvement, in, liberia, this, satisfied, southern, politicians, and, businessmen, especially, alabama, senator, john, tyler, morgan, morgan, saw, congo, as, the, same, opportunity, to, send, freedmen, to, africa, so, they, could, contribute, to, and, build, the, cotton, market, sanford, also, convinced, the, people, in, new, york, that, they, were, going, to, abolish, slavery, and, aid, travellers, and, scientists, in, order, to, have, the, public, s, support, after, henry, s, actions, in, convincing, president, arthur, the, united, states, was, the, first, country, to, recognize, congo, as, a, legitimate, sovereign, state, the, united, states, further, participated, in, the, process, of, recognition, by, sending, the, us, navy, congo, river, expedition, of, 1885, which, gave, a, detailed, description, of, travel, along, the, river, leopold, was, able, to, attract, scientific, and, humanitarian, backing, for, the, international, african, association, french, association, internationale, africaine, or, aia, which, he, formed, during, a, brussels, geographic, conference, of, geographic, societies, explorers, and, dignitaries, he, hosted, in, 1876, at, the, conference, leopold, proposed, establishing, an, international, benevolent, committee, for, the, propagation, of, civilization, among, the, peoples, of, central, africa, the, congo, region, the, aia, was, originally, conceived, as, a, multi, national, scientific, and, humanitarian, assembly, and, even, invited, gustave, moynier, as, member, of, the, international, law, institute, and, president, of, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, to, attend, their, 1877, conference, the, international, law, institute, was, supportive, of, the, project, under, the, belief, that, it, was, aimed, to, abolish, the, congo, basin, slave, trade, nevertheless, the, aia, eventually, became, a, development, company, controlled, by, leopold, after, 1879, and, the, crumbling, of, the, international, african, association, leopold, s, work, was, done, under, the, auspices, of, the, committee, for, studies, of, the, upper, congo, french, comit, d, tudes, du, haut, congo, the, committee, supposedly, an, international, commercial, scientific, and, humanitarian, group, was, in, fact, made, of, a, group, of, businessmen, who, had, shares, in, the, congo, with, leopold, holding, a, large, block, by, proxy, the, committee, itself, eventually, disintegrated, but, leopold, continued, to, refer, to, it, and, use, the, defunct, organization, as, a, smokescreen, for, his, operations, in, laying, claim, to, the, congo, region, belgium, does, not, need, a, colony, belgians, are, not, drawn, towards, overseas, enterprises, they, prefer, to, spend, their, energy, and, capital, in, countries, which, have, already, been, explored, or, on, less, risky, schemes, still, you, can, assure, his, majesty, of, my, whole, hearted, sympathy, for, the, generous, plan, he, had, conceived, as, long, as, the, congo, does, not, make, any, international, difficulties, for, us, walth, re, fr, re, orban, liberal, prime, minister, of, belgium, 1878, 84, determined, to, look, for, a, colony, for, himself, and, inspired, by, recent, reports, from, central, africa, leopold, began, patronizing, a, number, of, leading, explorers, including, henry, morton, stanley, leopold, established, the, international, african, association, a, charitable, organization, to, oversee, the, exploration, and, surveying, of, a, territory, based, around, the, congo, river, with, the, stated, goal, of, bringing, humanitarian, assistance, and, civilization, to, the, natives, in, the, berlin, conference, of, 1884, 85, european, leaders, officially, noted, leopold, s, control, over, the, 2, 600, 000, km, 2, 1, 000, 000, sq, mi, of, the, notionally, independent, congo, free, state, to, give, his, african, operations, a, name, that, could, serve, for, a, political, entity, leopold, created, between, 1879, and, 1882, the, international, association, of, the, congo, french, association, internationale, du, congo, or, aic, as, a, new, umbrella, organization, this, organization, sought, to, combine, the, numerous, small, territories, acquired, into, one, sovereign, state, and, asked, for, recognition, from, the, european, powers, on, 22, april, 1884, thanks, to, the, successful, lobbying, of, businessman, henry, shelton, sanford, at, leopold, s, request, president, chester, a, arthur, of, the, united, states, decided, that, the, cessions, claimed, by, leopold, from, the, local, leaders, were, lawful, and, recognized, the, international, association, of, the, congo, s, claim, on, the, region, becoming, the, first, country, to, do, so, in, 1884, the, us, secretary, of, state, said, the, government, of, the, united, states, announces, its, sympathy, with, and, approval, of, the, humane, and, benevolent, purposes, of, the, international, association, of, the, congo, in, november, 1884, otto, von, bismarck, convened, a, 14, nation, conference, to, submit, the, congo, question, to, international, control, and, to, finalize, the, colonial, partitioning, of, the, african, continent, most, major, powers, including, austria, hungary, belgium, france, germany, portugal, italy, the, united, kingdom, russia, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, united, states, attended, the, berlin, conference, and, drafted, an, international, code, governing, the, way, that, european, countries, should, behave, as, they, acquired, african, territory, the, conference, officially, recognized, the, international, congo, association, and, specified, that, it, should, have, no, connection, with, belgium, beyond, a, personal, union, or, any, other, country, but, would, be, under, the, personal, control, of, king, leopold, it, drew, specific, boundaries, and, specified, that, all, nations, should, have, access, to, do, business, in, the, congo, with, no, tariffs, the, slave, trade, would, be, suppressed, in, 1885, leopold, emerged, triumphant, france, was, given, 666, 000, km, 2, 257, 000, sq, mi, on, the, north, bank, the, modern, congo, brazzaville, and, central, african, republic, portugal, 909, 000, km, 2, 351, 000, sq, mi, to, the, south, modern, angola, and, leopold, s, personal, organization, received, the, balance, 2, 344, 000, km, 2, 905, 000, sq, mi, with, about, 30, million, people, however, it, still, remained, for, these, territories, to, be, occupied, under, the, conference, s, principle, of, effective, occupation, following, the, united, states, recognition, of, leopold, s, colony, other, western, powers, deliberated, on, the, news, portugal, flirted, with, the, french, at, first, but, the, british, offered, to, support, portugal, s, claim, to, the, entire, congo, in, return, for, a, free, trade, agreement, and, to, spite, their, french, rivals, britain, was, uneasy, at, french, expansion, and, had, a, technical, claim, on, the, congo, via, lieutenant, cameron, s, 1873, expedition, from, zanzibar, to, bring, home, livingstone, s, body, but, was, reluctant, to, take, on, yet, another, expensive, unproductive, colony, bismarck, of, germany, had, vast, new, holdings, in, southwest, africa, and, had, no, plans, for, the, congo, but, was, happy, to, see, rivals, britain, and, france, excluded, from, the, colony, in, 1885, leopold, s, efforts, to, establish, belgian, influence, in, the, congo, basin, were, awarded, with, the, tat, ind, pendant, du, congo, cfs, congo, free, state, by, a, resolution, passed, in, the, belgian, parliament, leopold, became, roi, souverain, sovereign, king, of, the, newly, formed, cfs, over, which, he, enjoyed, nearly, absolute, control, the, cfs, today, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, a, country, of, over, two, million, square, kilometres, became, leopold, s, personal, property, the, domaine, priv, eventually, the, congo, free, state, was, recognized, as, a, neutral, independent, sovereignty, by, various, european, and, north, american, states, leopold, used, the, title, sovereign, of, the, congo, free, state, as, ruler, of, the, congo, free, state, he, appointed, the, heads, of, the, three, departments, of, state, interior, foreign, affairs, and, finances, each, was, headed, by, an, administrator, general, administrateur, g, n, ral, later, a, secretary, general, secr, taire, g, n, ral, who, was, obligated, to, enact, the, policies, of, the, sovereign, or, else, resign, below, the, secretaries, general,

also, charged, with, overseeing, the, exploitation, of, the, congo, s, natural, resources, and, plantations, in, 1904, the, secretary, general, of, the, interior, set, up, a, propaganda, office, the, bureau, central, de, la, presse, central, press, bureau, in, frankfurt, under, the, auspices, of, the, comit, pour, la, repr, sentation, des, int, r, ts, coloniaux, en, afrique, in, german, komitee, zur, wahrung, der, kolonialen, interessen, in, afrika, committee, for, the, representation, of, colonial, interests, in, africa, the, oversight, of, all, the, departments, was, nominally, in, the, hands, of, the, governor, general, gouverneur, g, n, ral, but, this, office, was, at, times, more, honorary, than, real, when, the, governor, general, was, in, belgium, he, was, represented, in, the, congo, by, a, vice, governor, general, vice, gouverneur, g, n, ral, who, was, nominally, equal, in, rank, to, a, secretary, general, but, in, fact, was, beneath, them, in, power, and, influence, a, comit, consultatif, consultative, committee, made, up, of, civil, servants, was, set, up, in, 1887, to, assist, the, governor, general, but, he, was, not, obliged, to, consult, it, the, vice, governor, general, on, the, ground, had, a, state, secretary, through, whom, he, communicated, with, his, district, officers, the, free, state, had, an, independent, judiciary, headed, by, a, minister, of, justice, at, boma, the, minister, was, equal, in, rank, to, the, vice, governor, general, and, initially, answered, to, the, governor, general, but, was, eventually, made, responsible,

these, there, were, district, courts, and, public, prosecutors, procureurs, d, tat, justice, however, was, slow, and, the, system, ill, suited, to, a, frontier, society, leopold, no, longer, needed, the, fa, ade, of, the, association, and, replaced, it, with, an, appointed, cabinet, of, belgians, who, would, do, his, bidding, to, the, temporary, new, capital, of, boma, he, sent, a, governor, general, and, a, chief, of, police, the, vast, congo, basin, was, split, up, into, 14, administrative, districts, each, district, into, zones, each, zone, into, sectors, and, each, sector, into, posts, from, the, district, commissioners, down, to, post, level, every, appointed, head, was, european, however, with, little, financial, means, the, free, state, mainly, relied, on, local, elites, to, rule, and, tax, the, vast, and, hard, to, reach, congolese, interior, in, the, free, state, leopold, exercised, total, personal, control, without, much, delegation, to, subordinates, african, chiefs, played, an, important, role, in, the, administration, by, implementing, government, orders, within, their, communities, throughout, much, of, its, existence, however, free, state, presence, in, the, territory, that, it, claimed, was, patchy, with, its, few, officials, concentrated, in, a, number, of, small, and, widely, dispersed, stations, which, controlled, only, small, amounts, of, hinterland, in, 1900, there, were, just, 3, 000, europeans, in, the, congo, of, whom, only, half, were, belgian, the, colony, was, perpetually, short, of, administrative, staff, and, officials, who, numbered, between, 700, and, 1, 500, during, the, period, leopold, pledged, to, suppress, the, east, african, slave, trade, promote, humanitarian, policies, guarantee, free, trade, within, the, colony, impose, no, import, duties, for, twenty, years, and, encourage, philanthropic, and, scientific, enterprises, beginning, in, the, mid, 1880s, leopold, first, decreed, that, the, state, asserted, rights, of, proprietorship, over, all, vacant, lands, throughout, the, congo, territory, in, three, successive, decrees, leopold, promised, the, rights, of, the, congolese, in, their, land, to, native, villages, and, farms, essentially, making, nearly, all, of, the, cfs, terres, domaniales, state, owned, land, leopold, further, decreed, that, merchants, should, limit, their, commercial, operations, in, rubber, trade, with, the, natives, additionally, the, colonial, administration, liberated, thousands, of, slaves, four, main, problems, presented, themselves, over, the, next, few, years, leopold, could, not, meet, the, costs, of, running, the, congo, free, state, desperately, he, set, in, motion, a, system, to, maximize, revenue, the, first, change, was, the, introduction, of, the, concept, of, terres, vacantes, vacant, land, which, was, any, land, that, did, not, contain, a, habitation, or, a, cultivated, garden, plot, all, of, this, land, i, e, most, of, the, country, was, therefore, deemed, to, belong, to, the, state, servants, of, the, state, namely, any, men, in, leopold, s, employ, were, encouraged, to, exploit, it, shortly, after, the, brussels, anti, slavery, conference, 1889, 1890, leopold, issued, a, new, decree, mandating, that, africans, in, a, large, part, of, the, free, state, could, sell, their, harvested, products, mostly, ivory, and, rubber, only, to, the, state, this, law, extended, an, earlier, decree, declaring, that, all, unoccupied, land, belonged, to, the, state, any, ivory, or, rubber, collected, from, the, state, owned, land, the, reasoning, went, must, belong, to, the, state, thus, creating, a, de, facto, state, controlled, monopoly, therefore, a, large, share, of, the, local, population, could, sell, only, to, the, state, which, could, set, prices, and, thereby, control, the, income, the, congolese, could, receive, for, their, work, for, local, elites, however, this, system, presented, new, opportunities, as, the, free, state, and, concession, companies, paid, them, with, guns, to, tax, their, subjects, in, kind, trading, companies, began, to, lose, out, to, the, free, state, government, which, not, only, paid, no, taxes, but, also, collected, all, the, potential, income, these, companies, were, outraged, by, the, restrictions, on, free, trade, which, the, berlin, act, had, so, carefully, protected, years, before, their, protests, against, the, violation, of, free, trade, prompted, leopold, to, take, another, less, obvious, tack, to, make, money, a, decree, in, 1892, divided, the, terres, vacantes, into, a, domainal, system, that, privatized, extraction, rights, over, rubber, for, the, state, in, certain, private, domains, allowing, leopold, to, grant, vast, concessions, to, private, companies, in, other, areas, private, companies, could, continue, to, trade, but, were, highly, restricted, and, taxed, the, domainal, system, enforced, an, in, kind, tax, on, the, free, state, s, congolese,

state, paid, prices, below, the, rising, market, prices, in, october, 1892, leopold, granted, concessions, to, a, number, of, companies, each, company, was, given, a, large, amount, of, land, in, the, congo, free, state, on, which, to, collect, rubber, and, ivory, for, sale, in, europe, these, companies, were, allowed, to, detain, africans, who, did, not, work, hard, enough, to, police, their, vast, areas, as, they, saw, fit, and, to, take, all, the, products, of, the, forest, for, themselves, in, return, for, their, concessions, these, companies, paid, an, annual, dividend, to, the, free, state, at, the, height, of, the, rubber, boom, from, 1901, until, 1906, these, dividends, also, filled, the, royal, coffers, the, free, trade, zone, in, the, congo, was, open, to, entrepreneurs, of, any, european, nation, who, were, allowed, to, buy, 10, and, 15, year, monopoly, leases, on, anything, of, value, ivory, from, a, district, or, the, rubber, concession, for, example, the, other, zone, almost, two, thirds, of, the, congo, became, the, domaine, priv, the, exclusive, private, property, of, the, state, in, 1893, leopold, excised, the, most, readily, accessible, 259, 000, km, 2, 100, 000, sq, mi, portion, of, the, free, trade, zone, and, declared, it, to, be, the, domaine, de, la, couronne, literally, fief, of, the, crown, rubber, revenue, went, directly, to, leopold, who, paid, the, free, state, for, the, high, costs, of, exploitation, the, same, rules, applied, as, in, the, domaine, priv, in, 1896, global, demand, for, rubber, soared, from, that, year, onwards, the, congolese, rubber, sector, started, to, generate, vast, sums, of, money, at, an, immense, cost, for, the, local, population, early, in, leopold, s, rule, the, second, problem, the, british, south, africa, company, s, expansion, into, the, southern, congo, basin, was, addressed, the, distant, yeke, kingdom, in, katanga, on, the, upper, lualaba, river, had, signed, no, treaties, was, known, to, be, rich, in, copper, and, thought, to, have, much, gold, from, its, slave, trading, activities, its, powerful, mwami, king, msiri, had, already, rejected, a, treaty, brought, by, alfred, sharpe, on, behalf, of, cecil, rhodes, in, 1891, a, free, state, expedition, extracted, a, letter, from, msiri, agreeing, to, their, agents, coming, to, katanga, and, later, that, year, leopold, ii, sent, the, well, armed, stairs, expedition, led, by, the, canadian, mercenary, william, grant, stairs, to, take, possession, of, katanga, one, way, or, another, msiri, tried, to, play, the, free, state, off, against, rhodes, and, when, negotiations, bogged, down, stairs, flew, the, free, state, flag, anyway, and, gave, msiri, an, ultimatum, instead, msiri, decamped, to, another, stockade, stairs, sent, a, force, to, capture, him, but, msiri, stood, his, ground, whereupon, captain, omer, bodson, shot, msiri, dead, and, was, fatally, wounded, in, the, resulting, fight, the, expedition, cut, off, msiri, s, head, and, put, it, on, a, pole, as, he, had, often, done, to, his, enemies, this, was, to, impress, upon, the, locals, that, msiri, s, rule, had, really, ended, after, which, the, successor, chief, recognized, by, stairs, signed, the, treaty, in, the, short, term, the, third, problem, that, of, the, african, and, arab, slavers, like, zanzibari, swahili, strongman, tippu, tip, actually, amad, ibn, mu, ammad, ibn, jum, ah, ibn, rajab, ibn, mu, ammad, ibn, sa, d, al, murjab, but, much, better, known, by, his, nickname, was, temporarily, solved, initially, the, authority, of, the, congo, free, state, was, relatively, weak, in, the, eastern, regions, of, the, congo, in, early, 1887, henry, morton, stanley, had, therefore, proposed, that, tippu, tip, be, made, governor, wali, of, the, stanley, falls, district, both, leopold, ii, and, barghash, bin, said, of, zanzibar, agreed, and, on, 24, february, 1887, tippu, tip, accepted, in, the, longer, term, this, alliance, was, indefensible, at, home, and, abroad, leopold, ii, was, heavily, criticized, by, the, european, public, opinion, for, his, dealings, with, tippu, tip, in, belgium, the, belgian, anti, slavery, society, was, founded, in, 1888, mainly, by, catholic, intellectuals, led, by, count, hippolyte, d, ursel, aimed, at, abolishing, the, arab, slave, trade, furthermore, tippu, tip, and, leopold, were, commercial, rivals, every, person, that, tippu, tip, hunted, down, and, put, into, chattel, slavery, and, every, pound, of, ivory, he, exported, to, zanzibar, was, a, loss, to, leopold, ii, this, and, leopold, s, humanitarian, pledges, to, the, berlin, conference, to, end, slavery, meant, war, was, inevitable, open, warfare, broke, out, in, late, november, 1892, both, sides, fought, by, proxy, arming, and, leading, the, populations, of, the, upper, congo, forests, in, conflict, by, early, 1894, the, zanzibari, swahili, slavers, were, defeated, in, the, eastern, congo, region, and, the, congo, arab, war, came, to, an, end, the, belgians, freed, thousands, of, men, women, and, children, slaves, from, swaihili, arab, slave, owners, and, slave, traders, in, eastern, congo, in, 1886, 1892, enlisted, them, in, the, militia, force, publique, or, turned, them, over, as, prisoners, to, allied, local, chiefs, who, in, turn, gave, them, as, laborers, for, the, belgian, conscript, workers, when, belgian, congo, was, established, chattel, slavery, was, legally, abolished, in, 1910, but, prisoners, were, nevertheless, conscripted, as, force, laborers, for, both, public, and, private, work, projects, in, 1894, king, leopold, ii, signed, a, treaty, with, the, united, kingdom, which, conceded, a, strip, of, land, on, the, free, state, s, eastern, border, in, exchange, for, the, lado, enclave, which, provided, access, to, the, navigable, nile, and, extended, the, free, state, s, sphere, of, influence, northward, into, sudan, after, rubber, profits, soared, in, 1895, leopold, ordered, the, organization, of, an, expedition, into, the, lado, enclave, which, had, been, overrun, by, mahdist, rebels, since, the, outbreak, of, the, mahdist, war, in, 1881, the, expedition, was, composed, of, two, columns, the, first, under, belgian, war, hero, baron, dhanis, consisted, of, a, sizeable, force, numbering, around, three, thousand, and, was, to, strike, north, through, the, jungle, and, attack, the, rebels, at, their, base, at, rejaf, the, second, a, much, smaller, force, of, only, eight, hundred, was, led, by, louis, napol, on, chaltin, and, took, the, main, road, towards, rejaf, both, expeditions, set, out, in, december, 1896, although, leopold, ii, had, initially, planned, for, the, expedition, to, carry, on, much, farther, than, the, lado, enclave, hoping, indeed, to, take, fashoda, and, then, khartoum, dhanis, column, mutinied, in, february, 1897, resulting, in, the, death, of, several, belgian, officers, and, the, loss, of, his, entire, force, nonetheless, chaltin, continued, his, advance, and, on, 17, february, 1897, his, outnumbered, forces, defeated, the, rebels, in, the, battle, of, rejaf, securing, the, lado, enclave, as, a, belgian, territory, until, leopold, s, death, in, 1909, leopold, s, conquest, of, the, lado, enclave, met, with, approval, from, the, british, government, at, least, initially, which, welcomed, any, aid, in, their, ongoing, war, with, mahdist, sudan, but, frequent, raids, outside, of, lado, territory, by, belgian, congolese, forces, based, in, rejaf, caused, alarm, and, suspicion, among, british, and, french, officials, wary, of, leopold, s, imperial, ambitions, in, 1910, following, the, belgian, annexation, of, the, congo, free, state, as, the, belgian, congo, in, 1908, and, the, death, of, the, belgian, king, in, december, 1909, british, authorities, reclaimed, the, lado, enclave, as, per, the, anglo, congolese, treaty, signed, in, 1894, and, added, the, territory, to, anglo, egyptian, sudan, while, the, war, against, african, powers, was, ending, the, quest, for, income, was, increasing, fuelled, by, the, aire, policy, by, 1890, leopold, was, facing, considerable, financial, difficulty, district, officials, salaries, were, reduced, to, a, bare, minimum, and, made, up, with, a, commission, payment, based, on, the, profit, that, their, area, returned, to, leopold, after, widespread, criticism, this, primes, system, was, substituted, for, the, allocation, de, retraite, in, which, a, large, part, of, the, payment, was, granted, at, the, end, of, the, service, only, to, those, territorial, agents, and, magistrates, whose, conduct, was, judged, satisfactory, by, their, superiors, this, meant, in, practice, that, nothing, changed, congolese, communities, in, the, domaine, priv, were, not, merely, forbidden, by, law, to, sell, items, to, anyone, but, the, state, they, were, required, to, provide, state, officials, with, set, quotas, of, rubber, and, ivory, at, a, fixed, government, mandated, price, and, to, provide, food, to, the, local, post, in, direct, violation, of, his, promises, of, free, trade, within, the, cfs, under, the, terms, of, the, berlin, treaty, not, only, had, the, state, become, a, commercial, entity, directly, or, indirectly, trading, within, its, dominion, but, also, leopold, had, been, slowly, monopolizing, a, considerable, amount, of, the, ivory, and, rubber, trade, by, imposing, export, duties, on, the, resources, traded, by, other, merchants, within, the, cfs, in, terms, of, infrastructure, leopold, s, regime, began, construction, of, the, railway, that, ran, from, the, coast, to, the, capital, of, leopoldville, now, kinshasa, the, railway, now, known, as, the, matadi, kinshasa, railway, was, completed, in, 1898, by, the, final, decade, of, the, 19th, century, john, boyd, dunlop, s, 1887, invention, of, inflatable, rubber, bicycle, tubes, and, the, growing, usage, of, the, automobile, dramatically, increased, global, demand, for, rubber, to, monopolize, the, resources, of, the, entire, congo, free, state, leopold, issued, three, decrees, in, 1891, and, 1892, that, reduced, the, native, population, to, serfs, collectively, these, forced, the, natives, to, deliver, all, ivory, and, rubber, harvested, or, found, to, state, officers, thus, nearly, completing, leopold, s, monopoly, of, the, ivory, and, rubber, trade, the, rubber, came, from, wild, vines, in, the, jungle, unlike, the, rubber, from, brazil, hevea, brasiliensis, which, was, tapped, from, trees, to, extract, the, rubber, instead, of, tapping, the, vines, the, congolese, workers, would, slash, them, and, lather, their, bodies, with, the, rubber, latex, when, the, latex, hardened, it, would, be, scraped, off, the, skin, in, a, painful, manner, as, it, took, off, the, worker, s, hair, with, it, the, force, publique, fp, leopold, s, private, army, was, used, to, enforce, the, rubber, quotas, early, on, the, fp, was, used, primarily, to, campaign, against, the, arab, slave, trade, in, the, upper, congo, protect, leopold, s, economic, interests, and, suppress, the, frequent, uprisings, within, the, state, the, force, publique, s, officer, corps, included, only, white, europeans, belgian, regular, soldiers, and, mercenaries, from, other, countries, on, arriving, in, the, congo, the, army, included, men, from, zanzibar, west, africa, and, eventually, from, the, congo, itself, in, addition, leopold, had, been, actually, encouraging, the, slave, trade, among, arabs, in, the, upper, congo, in, return, for, slaves, to, fill, the, ranks, of, the, fp, during, the, 1890s, the, fp, s, primary, role, was, to, exploit, the, natives, as, corv, e, labourers, to, promote, the, rubber, trade, many, of, the, black, soldiers, were, from, far, off, peoples, of, the, upper, congo, while, others, had, been, kidnapped, in, raids, on, villages, in, their, childhood, and, brought, to, roman, catholic, missions, where, they, received, a, military, training, in, conditions, close, to, slavery, armed, with, modern, weapons, and, the, chicotte, a, bull, whip, made, of, hippopotamus, hide, the, force, publique, routinely, took, and, tortured, hostages, slaughtered, families, of, rebels, and, flogged, and, raped, congolese, people, with, a, reign, of, terror, and, abuse, that, cost, millions, of, lives, one, refugee, from, these, horrors, described, the, process, we, were, always, in, the, forest, to, find, the, rubber, vines, to, go, without, food, and, our, women, had, to, give, up, cultivating, the, fields, and, gardens, then, we, starved, when, we, failed, and, our, rubber, was, short, the, soldiers, came, to, our, towns, and, killed, us, many, were, shot, some, had, their, ears, cut, off, others, were, tied, up, with, ropes, round, their, necks, and, taken, away, they, also, burned, recalcitrant, villages, and, above, all, cut, off, the, hands, of, congolese, natives, including, children, the, human, hands, were, collected, as, trophies, on, the, orders, of, their, officers, to, show, that, bullets, had, not, been, wasted, officers, were, concerned, that, their, subordinates, might, waste, their, ammunition, on, hunting, animals, for, sport, so, they, required, soldiers, to, submit, one, hand, for, every, bullet, spent, these, mutilations, also, served, to, further, terrorize, the, congolese, into, submission, this, was, all, contrary, to, the, promises, of, uplift, made, at, the, berlin, conference, which, had, recognized, the, congo, free, state, failure, to, meet, the, rubber, collection, quotas, was, punishable, by, death, meanwhile, the, force, publique, were, required, to, provide, the, hand, of, their, victims, as, proof, when, they, had, shot, and, killed, someone, as, it, was, believed, that, they, would, otherwise, use, the, munitions, imported, from, europe, at, considerable, cost, for, hunting, as, a, consequence, the, rubber, quotas, were, in, part, paid, off, in, chopped, off, hands, sometimes, the, hands, were, collected, by, the, soldiers, of, the, force, publique, sometimes, by, the, villages, themselves, there, were, even, small, wars, where, villages, attacked, neighbouring, villages, to, gather, hands, since, their, rubber, quotas, were, too, unrealistic, to, fill, a, catholic, priest, quotes, a, man, tswambe, speaking, of, the, hated, state, official, l, on, fi, vez, who, ran, a, district, along, the, river, 500, km, 300, mi, north, of, stanley, pool, all, blacks, saw, this, man, as, the, devil, of, the, equator, from, all, the, bodies, killed, in, the, field, you, had, to, cut, off, the, hands, he, wanted, to, see, the, number, of, hands, cut, off, by, each, soldier, who, had, to, bring, them, in, baskets, a, village, which, refused, to, provide, rubber, would, be, completely, swept, clean, as, a, young, man, i, saw, soldier, molili, then, guarding, the, village, of,

protested, the, officer, in, command, ordered, us, to, cut, off, the, heads, of, the, men, and, hang, them, on, the, village, palisades, and, to, hang, the, women, and, the, children, on, the, palisade, in, the, form, of, a, cross, after, seeing, a, congolese, person, killed, for, the, first, time, a, danish, missionary, wrote, the, soldier, said, don, t, take, this, to, heart, so, much, they, kill, us, if, we, don, t, bring, the, rubber, the, commissioner, has, promised, us, if, we, have, plenty, of, hands, he, will, shorten, our, service, in, forbath, s, words, the, baskets, of, severed, hands, set, down, at, the, feet, of, the, european, post, commanders, became, the, symbol, of, the, congo, free, state, the, collection, of, hands, became, an, end, in, itself, force, publique, soldiers, brought, them, to, the, stations, in, place, of, rubber, they, even, went, out, to, harvest, them, instead, of, rubber, they, became, a, sort, of, currency, they, came, to, be, used, to, make, up, for, shortfalls, in, rubber, quotas, to, replace, the, people, who, were, demanded, for, the, forced, labour, gangs, and, the, force, publique, soldiers, were, paid, their, bonuses, on, the, basis, of, how, many, hands, they, collected, in, theory, each, right, hand, proved, a, killing, in, practice, to, save, ammunition, soldiers, sometimes, cheated, by, simply, cutting, off, the, hand, and, leaving, the, victim, to, live, or, die, more, than, a, few, survivors, later, said, that, they, had, lived, through, a, massacre, by, acting, dead, not, moving, even, when, their, hands, were, severed, and, waiting, till, the, soldiers, left, before, seeking, help, in, some, instances, a, soldier, could, shorten, his, service, term, by, bringing, more, hands, than, the, other, soldiers, which, led, to, widespread, mutilations, and, dismemberment, according, to, some, historians, cannibalism, was, widespread, in, parts, of, the, free, state, area, when, the, state, was, established, and, the, colonial, administration, seems, to, have, done, little, to, suppress, it, sometimes, rather, tolerating, it, among, its, own, auxiliary, troops, and, allies, during, the, congo, arab, war, there, were, reports, of, widespread, cannibalization, of, the, bodies, of, defeated, combatants, by, the, batetela, allies, of, the, belgian, commander, francis, dhanis, according, to, dhanis, s, medical, officer, captain, sidney, langford, hinde, the, conquest, of, nyangwe, was, followed, by, days, of, cannibal, feasting, during, which, hundreds, were, eaten, with, only, their, heads, being, kept, as, mementos, during, this, time, gongo, lutete, the, leader, of, the, batetela, hid, himself, in, his, quarters, appalled, by, the, sight, of, thousands, of, men, smoking, human, hands, and, human, chops, on, their, camp, fires, enough, to, feed, his, army, for, many, days, soon, after, nyangwe, s, surviving, population, rose, in, a, rebellion, during, whose, brutal, suppression, a, thousand, rioters, were, killed, by, the, new, government, one, young, belgian, officer, wrote, home, happily, gongo, s, men, ate, them, up, it, s, horrible, but, exceedingly, useful, and, hygienic, i, should, have, been, horrified, at, the, idea, in, europe, but, it, seems, quite, natural, to, me, here, don, t, show, this, letter, to, anyone, indiscreet, hinde, too, commented, approvingly, on, the, thoroughness, with, which, the, cannibals, disposed, of, all, the, dead, leaving, nothing, even, for, the, jackals, and, thus, sav, us, no, doubt, from, many, an, epidemic, when, sending, out, punitive, expeditions, against, villages, unwilling, or, unable, to, fulfil, the, government, s, exorbitant, rubber, quota, free, state, officials, repeatedly, turned, a, blind, eye, both, to, arbitrary, killings, of, those, considered, guilty, as, well, as, to, the, cannibal, feast, celebrated, by, native, soldiers, that, sometimes, followed, in, various, cases, they, even, handed, captives, including, infants, and, old, women, over, to, their, soldiers, or, local, allies, implicitly, or, even, explicitly, allowing, them, to, kill, and, eat, them, particularly, infamous, were, groups, of, songye, fighters, known, as, zappo, zaps, after, the, sound, of, their, rifles, and, employed, by, the, free, state, to, enforce, its, tax, policies, whenever, a, village, failed, to, produce, enough, rubber, these, men, would, attack, raping, and, eating, their, victims, before, cutting, off, their, hands, to, prove, the, success, of, their, operations, generally, most, free, state, officials, seem, to, have, had, little, interest, in, stopping, cannibal, customs, one, of, them, guy, burrows, wrote, that, when, he, was, stationed, near, the, mongala, river, he, and, his, colleagues, were, well, aware, that, scores, of, slaves, were, being, sold, to, supply, meat, to, the, people, on, the, other, side, of, the, river, but, that, to, his, regret, neither, the, state, nor, the, private, companies, active, in, the, area, did, anything, to, suppress, this, deadly, trade, in, slaves, for, the, shambles, instead, wholly, focussing, on, the, profitable, rubber, extraction, similarly, a, german, missionary, reported, an, open, trade, in, male, and, female, slaves, intended, for, consumption, near, the, mouth, of, the, aruwimi, river, twice, a, week, new, victims, delivered, by, dugout, canoe, were, bound, to, poles, with, their, ankles, dislocated, and, sticking, up, to, their, heads, in, the, water, after, four, days, their, flesh, was, tender, for, the, kitchen, and, they, were, slaughtered, the, free, state, finally, stepped, in, to, suppress, this, operation, and, execute, the, responsible, trader, but, only, in, 1906, more, than, 20, years, after, its, foundation, even, afterwards, slaves, were, still, offered, fairly, openly, for, eating, with, the, sellers, of, slave, children, pointing, out, the, value, of, their, meat, when, trying, to, negotiate, a, good, price, another, time, while, stationed, in, riba, riba, today, lokandu, in, the, eastern, maniema, region, burrows, rescued, a, young, slave, boy, from, becoming, the, pi, ce, de, r, sistance, of, a, banquet, planned, by, his, master, the, latter, not, only, freely, admitted, the, plan, but, failed, to, see, anything, wrong, with, it, it, turned, out, that, the, local, corporal, had, been, aware, of, the, planned, banquet, too, but, had, not, considered, it, worthy, of, mention, because, the, same, thing, had, often, occurred, in, the, neighbouring, villages, and, the, white, men, at, the, post, had, never, bothered, about, it, indeed, some, european, officers, working, for, the, free, state, themselves, developed, a, taste, for, human, flesh, according, to, forbath, a, reduction, of, the, population, of, the, congo, is, noted, by, all, who, have, compared, the, country, at, the, beginning, of, leopold, s, control, with, the, beginning, of, belgian, state, rule, in, 1908, but, estimates, of, the, death, toll, vary, considerably, estimates, of, some, contemporary, observers, suggest, that, the, population, decreased, by, half, during, this, period, according, to, edmund, d, morel, the, congo, free, state, counted, 20, million, souls, hence, mark, twain, mentioned, the, number, of, ten, million, deaths, according, to, irish, diplomat, roger, casement, this, depopulation, had, four, main, causes, indiscriminate, war, starvation, reduction, of, births, and, disease, sleeping, sickness, was, also, a, major, cause, of, fatality, at, the, time, opponents, of, leopold, s, rule, stated, however, that, the, administration, itself, was, to, be, considered, responsible, for, the, spreading, of, the, epidemic, in, the, absence, of, a, census, providing, even, an, initial, idea, of, the, size, of, population, of, the, region, at, the, inception, of, the, congo, free, state, the, first, was, taken, in, 1924, it, is, impossible, to, quantify, population, changes, in, the, period, despite, this, forbath, in, 1977, claimed, the, loss, was, at, least, five, million, adam, hochschild, and, jan, vansina, use, the, number, 10, million, hochschild, cites, several, recent, independent, lines, of, investigation, by, anthropologist, jan, vansina, and, others, that, examine, local, sources, police, records, religious, records, oral, traditions, genealogies, personal, diaries, which, generally, agree, with, the, assessment, of, the, 1919, belgian, government, commission, roughly, half, the, population, perished, during, the, free, state, period, since, the, first, official, census, by, the, belgian, authorities, in, 1924, put, the, population, at, about, 10, million, these, various, approaches, suggest, a, rough, estimate, of, a, total, of, 10, million, dead, however, jan, vansina, returned, to, the, issue, of, quantifying, the, total, population, decline, and, revised, his, earlier, position, criticizing, hochschild, for, extrapolating, the, 50, death, toll, from, the, rubber, provinces, to, the, entirety, of, the, congo, he, concluded, that, the, kuba, population, one, of, the, congolese, populations, was, rising, during, the, first, two, decades, of, leopold, ii, s, rule, and, declined, by, 25, per, cent, from, 1900, to, 1919, mainly, due, to, sickness, others, argued, a, decrease, of, 20, per, cent, over, the, first, forty, years, of, colonial, rule, up, to, the, census, of, 1924, according, to, the, congolese, historian, isidore, ndaywel, nziem, 13, million, died, although, he, later, changed, the, number, down, to, 10, million, after, the, publication, of, leopolds, ghost, to, put, these, population, changes, in, context, sourced, references, state, that, in, 1900, africa, as, a, whole, had, between, 90, million, and, 133, million, people, more, recent, extensive, demographic, research, agrees, with, vansina, in, his, criticism, of, hochschild, s, 10, million, claim, the, current, estimate, for, the, population, in, 1885, is, stated, at, around, most, likely, 11, 5, million, the, first, head, count, of, the, population, after, leopolds, reign, put, the, population, at, 10, or, 10, 3, million, which, is, a, population, decrease, of, around, 1, 2, or, 1, 5, million, people, the, causes, of, the, decline, were, multifactorial, and, included, lower, fertility, disease, famine, armed, violence, and, mass, emigration, however, no, verifiable, complete, records, exist, louis, and, stengers, state, that, population, figures, at, the, start, of, leopold, s, control, are, only, wild, guesses, while, calling, e, d, morel, s, attempt, and, others, at, coming, to, a, figure, for, population, losses, but, figments, of, the, imagination, however, authors, that, point, out, the, lack, of, reliable, demographic, data, are, questioned, by, others, calling, the, former, minimalists, and, agnosticists, proving, that, these, questions, remain, the, object, of, heated, debate, leopold, ran, up, high, debts, with, his, congo, investments, before, the, beginning, of, the, worldwide, rubber, boom, in, the, 1890s, prices, increased, throughout, the, decade, as, industries, discovered, new, uses, for, rubber, in, tires, hoses, tubing, insulation, for, telegraph, and, telephone, cables, and, wiring, by, the, late, 1890s, wild, rubber, had, far, surpassed, ivory, as, the, main, source, of, revenue, from, the, congo, free, state, the, peak, year, was, 1903, with, rubber, fetching, the, highest, price, and, concessionary, companies, raking, in, the, highest, profits, however, the, boom, sparked, efforts, to, find, lower, cost, producers, congolese, concessionary, companies, started, facing, competition, from, rubber, cultivation, in, southeast, asia, and, latin, america, as, plantations, were, begun, in, other, tropical, regions, around, the, world, the, global, price, of, rubber, started, to, dip, competition, heightened, the, drive, to, exploit, forced, labour, in, the, congo, in, order, to, lower, production, costs, meanwhile, the, cost, of, enforcement, was, eating, away, at, profit, margins, along, with, the, toll, taken, by, the, increasingly, unsustainable, harvesting, methods, as, competition, from, other, areas, of, rubber, cultivation, mounted, leopold, s, private, rule, was, left, increasingly, vulnerable, to, international, scrutiny, missionaries, carefully, documented, and, exposed, atrocities, committed, eye, witness, reports, from, missionaries, portrayed, actions, by, the, state, that, broke, laws, set, by, the, european, nations, as, rumours, circulated, leopold, attempted, to, discredit, them, even, creating, a, commission, for, the, protection, of, the, natives, in, january, 1908, william, henry, sheppard, published, a, report, on, colonial, abuses, in, the, american, presbyterian, congo, mission, apcm, newsletter, and, both, he, and, william, morrison, were, sued, for, libel, against, the, kasai, rubber, company, compagnie, de, kasai, a, prominent, belgian, rubber, contractor, in, the, area, when, the, case, went, to, court, in, september, 1909, the, two, missionaries, had, support, from, the, cra, american, progressives, and, their, lawyer, emile, vandervelde, the, judge, acquitted, sheppard, morrison, had, been, acquitted, earlier, on, a, technicality, on, the, premise, that, his, editorial, had, not, named, the, major, company, but, smaller, charter, companies, instead, however, it, is, likely, that, the, case, was, decided, in, favour, of, sheppard, as, a, result, of, international, politics, the, u, s, socially, in, support, of, the, missionaries, had, questioned, the, validity, of, king, leopold, ii, s, rule, over, the, congo, sheppard, s, documented, cases, of, cruelty, or, violence, were, in, direct, violation, of, the, berlin, act, of, 1885, which, gave, leopold, ii, control, over, the, congo, as, long, as, he, care, for, the, improvements, of, their, conditions, of, their, moral, and, material, well, being, and, help, in, suppressing, slavery, however, historians, have, noted, that, he, and, other, missionaries, have, traditionally, received, little, recognition, for, their, contributions, and, reports, joseph, conrad, s, novel, heart, of, darkness, originally, published, in, 1899, as, a, three, part, series, in, blackwood, s, magazine, inspired, by, his, service, as, a, captain, on, a, steamer, on, the, congo, 12, years, before, sparked, an, organized, international, opposition, to, leopold, s, exploitational, activities, in, 1900, edmund, dene, morel, a, part, time, journalist, and, head, of, trade, with, congo, for, the, liverpool, shipping, firm, elder, dempster, noticed, that, ships, that, brought, vast, loads, of, rubber, from, the, congo, only, ever, returned, there, loaded, with, guns, and, ammunition, for, the, force, publique, morel, became, a, journalist, and, then, a, publisher, attempting, to, discredit, leopold, s, regime, in, 1902, morel, retired, from, his, position, at, elder, dempster, to, focus, on, campaigning, he, founded, his, own, magazine, the, west, african, mail, and, conducted, speaking, tours, in, britain, increasing, public, outcry, over, the, atrocities, in, the, cfs, moved, the, british, government, to, launch, an, official, investigation, in, 1903, morel, and, those, who, agreed, with, him, in, the, house, of, commons, succeeded, in, passing, a, resolution, calling, on, the, british, government, to, conduct, an, inquiry, into, alleged, violations, of, the, berlin, agreement, roger, casement, then, the, british, consul, at, boma, at, the, mouth, of, the, congo, river, was, sent, to, the, congo, free, state, to, investigate, reporting, back, to, the, foreign, office, in, 1900, casement, wrote, the, root, of, the, evil, lies, in, the, fact, that, the, government, of, the, congo, is, above, all, a, commercial, trust, that, everything, else, is, orientated, towards, commercial, gain, e, d, morel, was, introduced, to, roger, casement, by, their, mutual, friend, herbert, ward, just, before, the, publication, of, casement, s, 1904, detailed, eyewitness, report, known, as, the, casement, report, in, 1904, and, realized, that, he, had, found, the, ally, he, had, sought, casement, convinced, morel, to, establish, an, organization, for, dealing, specifically, with, the, congo, question, the, congo, reform, association, with, casement, s, and, dr, guinness, s, assistance, he, set, up, and, ran, the, congo, reform, association, which, worked, to, end, leopold, s, control, of, the, congo, free, state, branches, of, the, association, were, established, as, far, away, as, the, united, states, the, congo, reform, movement, s, members, included, sir,

the, 19th, century, the, congo, reform, movement, led, a, vigorous, international, movement, against, the, maltreatment, of, the, congolese, population, the, british, parliament, demanded, a, meeting, of, the, 14, signatory, powers, to, review, the, 1885, berlin, agreement, the, belgian, parliament, pushed, by, emile, vandervelde, and, other, critics, of, the, king, s, congolese, policy, forced, leopold, to, set, up, an, independent, commission, of, inquiry, and, despite, the, king, s, efforts, in, 1905, it, confirmed, casement, s, report, one, of, the, main, ways, britain, was, involved, in, ending, leopold, s, rule, in, the, congo, was, by, making, belgium, as, a, whole, more, aware, of, the, brutality, present, in, the, congo, e, d, morel, was, one, of, the, key, british, activists, for, a, congo, free, from, belgian, rule, once, the, us, became, aware, of, the, occurrences, in, the, congo, morel, began, the, congo, reform, association, one, of, the, methods, morel, used, to, make, the, world, more, aware, of, the, atrocities, in, the, congo, during, leopold, s, rule, was, through, the, press, articles, were, published, in, both, magazines, and, newspapers, in, order, to, make, the, people, of, these, powerful, countries, such, as, the, us, and, great, britain, more, aware, of, what, truly, was, being, done, in, this, part, of, africa, with, this, newfound, unwanted, publicity, the, belgian, government, was, pressured, in, assuming, control, of, the, congo, from, leopold, individuals, such, as, george, washington, williams, also, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, congo, free, state, propaganda, war, in, his, famous, letter, an, open, letter, to, his, serene, majesty, l, opold, ii, king, of, the, belgians, and, sovereign, of, the, independent, state, of,
