the, mughal, empire, was, an, early, modern, empire, in, south, asia, at, its, peak, the, empire, stretched, from, the, outer, fringes, of, the, indus, river, basin, in, the, west, northern, afghanistan, in, the, northwest, and, kashmir, in, the, north, to, the, highlands, of, present, day, assam, and, bangladesh, in, the, east, and, the, uplands, of, the, deccan, plateau, in, south, india, the, mughal, empire, is, conventionally, said, to, have, been, founded, in, 1526, by, babur, a, timurid, chieftain, from, transoxiana, who, employed, aid, from, the, neighboring, safavid, and, ottoman, empires, to, defeat, the, sultan, of, delhi, ibrahim, lodi, in, the, first, battle, of, panipat, and, to, sweep, down, the, plains, of, north, india, the, mughal, imperial, structure, however, is, sometimes, dated, to, 1600, to, the, rule, of, babur, s, grandson, akbar, this, imperial, structure, lasted, until, 1720, until, shortly, after, the, death, of, the, last, major, emperor, aurangzeb, during, whose, reign, the, empire, also, achieved, its, maximum, geographical, extent, reduced, subsequently, to, the, region, in, and, around, old, delhi, by, 1760, the, empire, was, formally, dissolved, by, the, british, raj, after, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, although, the, mughal, empire, was, created, and, sustained, by, military, warfare, it, did, not, vigorously, suppress, the, cultures, and, peoples, it, came, to, rule, rather, it, equalized, and, placated, them, through, new, administrative, practices, and, diverse, ruling, elites, leading, to, more, efficient, centralised, and, standardized, rule, the, base, of, the, empire, s, collective, wealth, was, agricultural, taxes, instituted, by, the, third, mughal, emperor, akbar, these, taxes, which, amounted, to, well, over, half, the, output, of, a, peasant, cultivator, were, paid, in, the, well, regulated, silver, currency, and, caused, peasants, and, artisans, to, enter, larger, markets, the, relative, peace, maintained, by, the, empire, during, much, of, the, 17th, century, was, a, factor, in, india, s, economic, expansion, the, burgeoning, european, presence, in, the, indian, ocean, and, an, increasing, demand, for, indian, raw, and, finished, products, generated, much, wealth, for, the, mughal, court, there, was, more, conspicuous, consumption, among, the, mughal, elite, resulting, in, greater, patronage, of, painting, literary, forms, textiles, and, architecture, especially, during, the, reign, of, shah, jahan, among, the, mughal, unesco, world, heritage, sites, in, south,

followers, were, chagatai, turks, and, not, mongols, the, term, mughal, was, applied, to, them, in, india, by, association, with, the, mongols, and, to, distinguish, them, from, the, afghan, elite, which, ruled, the, delhi, sultanate, the, term, remains, disputed, by, indologists, in, marshall, hodgson, s, view, the, dynasty, should, be, called, timurid, timuri, or, indo, timuri, the, mughal,

wine, vessels, and, pouring, the, wine, down, a, well, however, by, this, time, lodi, s, empire, was, already, crumbling, and, it, was, the, rajput, confederacy, which, was, the, strongest, power, of, northern, india, under, the, capable, rule, of, rana, sanga, of, mewar, he, defeated, babur, in, the, battle, of, bayana, however, in, the, decisive, battle, of, khanwa, which, was, fought, near, agra, the, timurid, forces, of, babur, defeated, the, rajput, army, of, sanga, this, battle, was, one, of, the, most, decisive, and, historic, battles, in, indian, history, as, it, sealed, the, fate, of, northern, india, for, the, next, two, centuries, after, the, battle, the, centre, of, mughal, power, became, agra, instead, of, kabul, the, preoccupation, with, wars, and, military, campaigns, however, did, not, allow, the, new, emperor, to, consolidate, the, gains, he, had, made, in, india, the, instability, of, the, empire, became, evident, under, his, son, humayun, reigned, 1530, 1556,

subcontinent, north, of, the, godavari, river, he, created, a, new, ruling, elite, loyal, to, him, implemented, a, modern, administration, and, encouraged, cultural, developments, he, increased, trade, with, european, trading, companies, india, developed, a, strong, and, stable, economy, leading, to, commercial, expansion, and, economic, development, akbar, allowed, freedom, of, religion, at, his, court, and, attempted, to, resolve, socio, political, and, cultural, differences, in, his, empire, by, establishing, a, new, religion, din, i, ilahi, with, strong, characteristics, of, a, ruler, cult, he, left, his, son, an, internally, stable, state, which, was, in, the, midst, of, its, golden, age, but, before, long, signs, of, political, weakness, would, emerge, jahangir, born, salim,

opium, neglected, the, affairs, of, the, state, and, came, under, the, influence, of, rival, court, cliques, jahangir, distinguished, himself, from, akbar, by, making, substantial, efforts, to, gain, the, support, of, the, islamic, religious, establishment, one, way, he, did, this, was, by, bestowing, many, more, madad, i, ma, ash, tax, free, personal, land, revenue, grants, given, to, religiously, learned, or, spiritually, worthy, individuals, than, akbar, had, in, contrast, to, akbar, jahangir, came, into, conflict, with, non, muslim, religious, leaders, notably, the, sikh, guru,

jagat, gosain, a, rajput, princess, his, reign, ushered, in, the, golden, age, of, mughal, architecture, during, the, reign, of, shah, jahan, the, splendour, of, the, mughal, court, reached, its, peak, as, exemplified, by, the, taj, mahal, the, cost, of, maintaining, the, court, however, began, to, exceed, the, revenue, coming, in, his, reign, was, called, as, the, golden, age, of, mughal, architecture, shah, jahan, extended, the, mughal, empire, to, the, deccan, by, ending, the, nizam, shahi, dynasty, and, forcing, the, adil, shahis, and, qutb, shahis, to, pay, tribute, shah, jahan, s, eldest, son, the, liberal, dara, shikoh, became, regent, in, 1658, as, a, result, of, his, father, s, illness, dara, championed, a, syncretistic, hindu, muslim, culture, emulating, his, great, grandfather, akbar, with, the, support, of, the, islamic, orthodoxy, however, a, younger, son, of, shah, jahan, aurangzeb, r, 1658, 1707, seized, the, throne, aurangzeb, defeated, dara, in, 1659, and, had, him, executed, although, shah, jahan, fully, recovered, from, his, illness, aurangzeb, kept, shah, jahan, imprisoned, until, he, died, in, 1666, 68, aurangzeb, oversaw, an, increase, in, the, islamicization, of, the, mughal, state, he, encouraged, conversion, to, islam, reinstated, the, jizya, on, non, muslims, and, compiled, the, fatawa, alamgiri, a, collection, of, islamic, law, aurangzeb, also, ordered, the, execution, of, the, sikh, guru, tegh, bahadur, leading, to, the, militarization, of, the, sikh, community, from, the, imperial, perspective, conversion, to, islam, integrated, local, elites, into, the, king, s, vision, of, network, of, shared, identity, that, would, join, disparate, groups, throughout, the, empire, in, obedience, to, the, mughal, emperor, his, campaign, to, conquer, south, and, western, india, nominally, increased, the, size, of, mughal, empire, but, had, a, ruinous, effect, on, mughal, empire, this, campaign, also, had, a, ruinous, effect, on, mughal, treasury, and, emperor, s, absence, led, to, a, severe, decline, in, governance, in, northern, india, marathas, started, expanding, northwards, shortly, after, the, death, of, aurangzeb, defeated, the, mughals, in, delhi, and, bhopal, and, extended, their, empire, up, to, peshawar, by, 1758, aurangzeb, is, considered, india, s, most, controversial, king, with, some, historians, arguing, his, religious, conservatism, and, intolerance, undermined, the, stability, of, mughal, society, while, other, historians, question, this, noting, that, he, built, hindu, temples, employed, significantly, more, hindus, in, his, imperial, bureaucracy, than, his, predecessors, did, opposed, bigotry, against, hindus, and, shia, muslims, 58, despite, these, allegations, it, has, been, acknowledged, that, emperor, aurangzeb, enacted, repressive, policies, towards, non, muslims, which, also, resulted, to, a, major, rebellion, by, the, marathas, aurangzeb, s, son, bahadur, shah, i, repealed, the, religious, policies, of, his, father, and, attempted, to, reform, the, administration, however, after, he, died, in, 1712, the, mughal, dynasty, began, to, sink, into, chaos, and, violent, feuds, in, 1719, alone, four, emperors, successively, ascended, the, throne, as, figureheads, under, the, rule, of, a, brotherhood, of, nobles, belonging, to, the, indian, muslim, caste, known, as, the, sadaat, e, bara, whose, leaders, the, sayyid, brothers, became, the, de, facto, sovereigns, of, the, empire, during, the, reign, of, muhammad, shah, reigned, 1719, 1748, the, empire, began, to, break, up, and, vast, tracts, of, central, india, passed, from, mughal, to, maratha, hands, as, the, mughals, tried, to, suppress, the, independence, of, nizam, ul, mulk, asaf, jah, i, in, the, deccan, he, encouraged, the, marathas, to, invade, central, and, northern, india, the, indian, campaign, of, nader, shah, who, had, previously, reestablished, iranian, suzerainty, over, most, of, west, asia, the, caucasus, and, central, asia, culminated, with, the, sack, of, delhi, shattering, the, remnants, of, mughal, power, and, prestige, and, taking, off, all, the, accumulated, mughal, treasury, the, mughals, could, no, longer, finance, the, huge, armies, with, which, they, had, formerly, enforced, their, rule, many, of, the, empire, s, elites, now, sought, to, control, their, affairs, and, broke, away, to, form, independent, kingdoms, but, lip, service, continued, to, be, paid, to, the, mughal, emperor, as, the, highest, manifestation, of, sovereignty, not, only, the, muslim, gentry, but, the, maratha, hindu, and, sikh, leaders, took, part, in, ceremonial, acknowledgements, of, the, emperor, as, the, sovereign, of, india, meanwhile, some, regional, polities, within, the, increasingly, fragmented, mughal, empire, involved, themselves, and, the, state, in, global, conflicts, leading, only, to, defeat, and, loss, of, territory, during, the, carnatic, wars, and, the, bengal, war, the, mughal, emperor, shah, alam, ii, 1759, 1806, made, futile, attempts, to, reverse, the, mughal, decline, but, when, the, third, battle, of, panipat, was, fought, between, the, maratha, empire, and, the, afghans, led, by, abdali, in, 1761, in, which, the, afghans, were, victorious, the, emperor, had, ignominiously, taken, temporary, refuge, with, the, british, to, the, east, in, 1771, the, marathas, recaptured, delhi, from, afghan, control, and, in, 1784, they, officially, became, the, protectors, of, the, emperor, in, delhi, a, state, of, affairs, that, continued, until, the, second, anglo, maratha, war, thereafter, the, british, east, india, company, became, the, protectors, of, the, mughal, dynasty, in, delhi, the, british, east, india, company, took, control, of, the, former, mughal, province, of, bengal, bihar, in, 1793, after, it, abolished, local, rule, nizamat, that, lasted, until, 1858, marking, the, beginning, of, british, colonial, era, over, the, indian, subcontinent, by, 1857, a, considerable, part, of, former, mughal, india, was, under, the, east, india, company, s, control, after, a, crushing, defeat, in, the, war, of, 1857, 1858, which, he, nominally, led, the, last, mughal, bahadur, shah, zafar, was, deposed, by, the, british, east, india, company, and, exiled, in, 1858, zafar, was, exiled, to, rangoon, burma, his, wife, zeenat, mahal, and, some, of, the, remaining, members, of, the, family, accompanied, him, at, 4, am, on, 7, october, 1858, zafar, along, with, his, wives, and, two, remaining, sons, began, his, journey, towards, rangoon, in, bullock, carts, escorted, by, 9th, lancers, under, the, command, of, lieutenant, ommaney, through, the, government, of, india, act, 1858, the, british, crown, assumed, direct, control, of, east, india, company, held, territories, in, india, in, the, form, of, the, new, british, raj, in, 1876, the, british, queen, victoria, assumed, the, title, of, empress, of, india, historians, have, offered, numerous, accounts, of, the, several, factors, involved, in, the, rapid, collapse, of, the, mughal, empire, between, 1707, and, 1720, after, a, century, of, growth, and, prosperity, a, succession, of, short, lived, incompetent, and, weak, rulers, and, civil, wars, over, the, succession, created, political, instability, at, the, centre, the, mughals, appeared, virtually, unassailable, during, the, 17th, century, but, once, gone, their, imperial, overstretch, became, clear, and, the, situation, could, not, be, recovered, the, seemingly, innocuous, european, trading, companies, such, as, the, british, east, indies, company, played, no, real, part, in, the, initial, decline, they, were, still, racing, to, get, permission, from, the, mughal, rulers, to, establish, trades, and, factories, in, india, in, fiscal, terms, the, throne, lost, the, revenues, needed, to, pay, its, chief, officers, the, emirs, nobles, and, their, entourages, the, emperor, lost, authority, as, the, widely, scattered, imperial, officers, lost, confidence, in, the, central, authorities, and, made, their, deals, with, local, men, of, influence, the, imperial, army, bogged, down, in, long, futile, wars, against, the, more, aggressive, marathas, and, lost, its, fighting, spirit, finally, came, a, series, of, violent, political, feuds, over, control, of, the, throne, after, the, execution, of, emperor, farrukhsiyar, in, 1719, local, mughal, successor, states, took, power, in, region, after, region, contemporary, chroniclers, bewailed, the, decay, they, witnessed, a, theme, picked, up, by, the, first, british, historians, who, wanted, to, underscore, the, need, for, a, british, led, rejuvenation, since, the, 1970s, historians, have, taken, multiple, approaches, to, the, decline, with, little, consensus, on, which, factor, was, dominant, the, psychological, interpretations, emphasise, depravity, in, high, places, excessive, luxury, and, increasingly, narrow, views, that, left, the, rulers, unprepared, for, an, external, challenge, a, marxist, school, led, by, irfan, habib, and, based, at, aligarh, muslim, university, emphasises, excessive, exploitation, of, the, peasantry, by, the, rich, which, stripped, away, the, will, and, the, means, to, support, the, regime, karen, leonard, has, focused, on, the, failure, of, the, regime, to, work, with, hindu, baniya, whose, financial, support, was, increasingly, needed, the, bankers, then, helped, the, maratha, and, the, british, in, a, religious, interpretation, some, scholars, argue, that, the, hindu, powers, revolted, against, the, rule, of, a, muslim, dynasty, finally, other, scholars, argue, that, the, very, prosperity, of, the, empire, inspired, the, provinces, to, achieve, a, high, degree, of, independence, thus, weakening, the, imperial, court, jeffrey, g, williamson, has, argued, that, the, indian, economy, went, through, deindustrialization, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 18th, century, as, an, indirect, outcome, of, the, collapse, of, the, mughal, empire, with, british, rule, later, causing, further, deindustrialization, according, to, williamson, the, decline, of, the, mughal, empire, led, to, a, decline, in, agricultural, productivity, which, drove, up, food, prices, then, nominal, wages, and, then, textile, prices, which, led, to, india, losing, a, share, of, the, world, textile, market, to, britain, even, before, it, had, superior, factory, technology, indian, textiles, however, still, maintained, a, competitive, advantage, over, british, textiles, up, until, the, 19th, century, the, mughal, empire, had, a, highly, centralised, bureaucratic, government, most, of, which, was, instituted, during, the, rule, of, the, third, mughal, emperor, akbar, the, central, government, was, headed, by, the, mughal, emperor, immediately, beneath, him, were, four, ministries, the, finance, revenue, ministry, headed, by, an, official, called, a, diwan, was, responsible, for, controlling, revenues, from, the, empire, s, territories, calculating, tax, revenues, and, using, this, information, to, distribute, assignments, the, ministry, of, the, military, army, intelligence, was, headed, by, an, official, titled, mir, bakhshi, who, was, in, charge, of, military, organisation, messenger, service, and, the, mansabdari, system, the, ministry, in, charge, of, law, religious, patronage, was, the, responsibility, of, the, sadr, as, sudr, who, appointed, judges, and, managed, charities, and, stipends, another, ministry, was, dedicated, to, the, imperial, household, and, public, works, headed, by, the, mir, saman, of, these, ministers, the, diwan, held, the, most, importance, and, typically, acted, as, the, wazir, prime, minister, of, the, empire, the, empire, was, divided, into, subah, provinces, each, of, which, was, headed, by, a, provincial, governor, called, a, subadar, the, structure, of, the, central, government, was, mirrored, at, the, provincial, level, each, suba, had, its, own, bakhshi, sadr, as, sudr, and, finance, minister, that, reported, directly, to, the, central, government, rather, than, the, subahdar, subas, were, subdivided, into, administrative, units, known, as, sarkars, which, were, further, divided, into, groups, of, villages, known, as, parganas, mughal, government, in, the, pargana, consisted, of, a, muslim, judge, and, local, tax, collector, parganas, were, the, basic, administrative, unit, of, the, mughal, empire, mughal, administrative, divisions, were, not, static, territories, were, often, rearranged, and, reconstituted, for, better, administrative, control, and, to, extend, cultivation, for, example, a, sarkar, could, turn, into, a, subah, and, parganas, were, often, transferred, between, sarkars, the, hierarchy, of, division, was, ambiguous, sometimes, as, a, territory, could, fall, under, multiple, overlapping, jurisdictions, administrative, divisions, were, also, vague, in, their, geography, the, mughal, state, did, not, have, enough, resources, or, authority, to, undertake, detailed, land, surveys, and, hence, the, geographical, limits, of, these, divisions, were, not, formalised, and, maps, were, not, created, the, mughals, instead, recorded, detailed, statistics, about, each, division, to, assess, the, territory, s, capacity, for, revenue, based, on, simpler, land, surveys, the, mughals, had, multiple, imperial, capitals, established, throughout, their, rule, these, were, the, cities, of, agra, delhi, lahore, and, fatehpur, sikri, power, often, shifted, back, and, forth, between, these, capitals, sometimes, this, was, necessitated, by, political, and, military, demands, but, shifts, also, occurred, for, ideological, reasons, for, example, akbar, s, establishment, of, fatehpur, sikri, or, even, simply, because, the, cost, of, establishing, a, new, capital, was, marginal, situations, where, there, were, two, simultaneous, capitals, happened, multiple, times, in, mughal, history, certain, cities, also, served, as, short, term, provincial, capitals, as, was, the, case, with, aurangzeb, s, shift, to, aurangabad, in, the, deccan, kabul, was, the, summer, capital, of, mughals, from, 1526, to, 1681, the, imperial, camp, used, for, military, expeditions, and, royal, tours, also, served, as, a, kind, of, mobile, de, facto, administrative, capital, from, the, time, of, akbar, mughal, camps, were, huge, in, scale, accompanied, by, numerous, personages, associated, with, the, royal, court, as, well, as, soldiers, and, labourers, all, administration, and, governance, were, carried, out, within, them, the, mughal, emperors, spent, a, significant, portion, of, their, ruling, period, within, these, camps, after, aurangzeb, the, mughal, capital, definitively, became, the, walled, city, of, shahjahanabad, old, delhi, the, mughal, empire, s, legal, system, was, context, specific, and, evolved, throughout, the, empire, s, rule, being, a, muslim, state, the, empire, employed, fiqh, islamic, jurisprudence, and, therefore, the, fundamental, institutions, of, islamic, law, such, as, those, of, the, qadi, judge, mufti, jurisconsult, and, muhtasib, censor, and, market, supervisor, were, well, established, in, the, mughal, empire, however, the, dispensation, of, justice, also, depended, on, other, factors, such, as, administrative, rules, local, customs, and, political, convenience, this, was, due, to, persianate, influences, on, mughal, ideology, and, that, the, mughal, empire, governed, a, non, muslim, majority, scholar, mouez, khalfaoui, notes, that, legal, institutions, in, the, mughal, empire, systemically, suffered, from, the, corruption, of, local, judges, the, mughal, empire, followed, the, sunni, hanafi, system, of, jurisprudence, in, its, early, years, the, empire, relied, on, hanafi, legal, references, inherited, from, its, predecessor, the, delhi, sultanate, these, included, the, al, hidayah, the, best, guidance, and, the, fatawa, al, tatarkhaniyya, religious, decisions, of, the, emire, tatarkhan, during, the, mughal, empire, s, peak, the, fatawa, alamgiri, was, commissioned, by, emperor, aurangzeb, this, compendium, of, hanafi, law, sought, to, serve, as, a, central, reference, for, the, mughal, state, that, dealt, with, the, specifics, of, the, south, asian, context, the, mughal, empire, also, drew, on, persian, notions, of, kingship, particularly, this, meant, that, the, mughal, emperor, was, considered, the, supreme, authority, on, legal, affairs, various, kinds, of, courts, existed, in, the, mughal, empire, one, such, court, was, that, of, the, qadi, the, mughal, qadi, was, responsible, for, dispensing, justice, this, included, settling, disputes, judging, people, for, crimes, and, dealing, with, inheritances, and, orphans, the, qadi, also, had, additional, importance, in, documents, as, the, seal, of, the, qadi, was, required, to, validate, deeds, and, tax, records, qadis, did, not, constitute, a, single, position, but, made, up, a, hierarchy, for, example, the, most, basic, kind, was, the, pargana, district, qadi, more, prestigious, positions, were, those, of, the, qadi, al, quddat, judge, of, judges, who, accompanied, the, mobile, imperial, camp, and, the, qadi, yi, lashkar, judge, of, the, army, qadis, were, usually, appointed, by, the, emperor, or, the, sadr, us, sudr, chief, of, charities, the, jurisdiction, of, the, qadi, was, availed, by, muslims, and, non, muslims, alike, the, jagirdar, local, tax, collector, was, another, kind, of, official, approach, especially, for, high, stakes, cases, subjects, of, the, mughal, empire, also, took, their, grievances, to, the, courts, of, superior, officials, who, held, more, authority, and, punitive, power, than, the, local, qadi, such, officials, included, the, kotwal, local, police, the, faujdar, an, officer, controlling, multiple, districts, and, troops, of, soldiers, and, the, most, powerful, the, subahdar, provincial, governor, in, some, cases, the, emperor, dispensed, justice, directly, jahangir, was, known, to, have, installed, a, chain, of, justice, in, the, agra, fort, that, any, aggrieved, subject, could, shake, to, get, the, attention, of, the, emperor, and, bypass, the, inefficacy, of, officials, self, regulating, tribunals, operating, at, the, community, or, village, level, were, common, but, sparse, documentation, of, them, exists, for, example, it, is, unclear, how, panchayats, village, councils, operated, in, the, mughal, era, the, economy, in, the, indian, subcontinent, during, the, mughal, era, performed, just, as, it, did, in, ancient, times, though, now, it, would, face, the, stress, of, extensive, regional, tensions, the, mughal, economy, was, large, and, prosperous, india, was, producing, 24, 5, of, the, world, s, manufacturing, output, up, until, 1750, india, s, economy, has, been, described, as, a, form, of, proto, industrialization, like, that, of, 18th, century, western, europe, prior, to, the, industrial, revolution, modern, historians, and, researchers, generally, agreed, that, the, mughal, empire, economic, policy, character, is, resembling, laissez, faire, system, in, dealing, with, tradings, and, bullions, to, achieve, the, economic, ends, the, mughals, were, responsible, for, building, an, extensive, road, system, creating, a, uniform, currency, and, the, unification, of, the, country, 185, 204, the, empire, had, an, extensive, road, network, which, was, vital, to, the, economic, infrastructure, built, by, a, public, works, department, set, up, by, the, mughals, which, designed, constructed, and, maintained, roads, linking, towns, and, cities, across, the, empire, making, trade, easier, to, conduct, the, main, base, of, the, empire, s, collective, wealth, was, agricultural, taxes, instituted, by, the, third, mughal, emperor, akbar, these, taxes, which, amounted, to, well, over, half, the, output, of, a, peasant, cultivator, were, paid, in, the, well, regulated, silver, currency, and, caused, peasants, and, artisans, to, enter, larger, markets, in, circa, 1595, modern, historians, estimated, the, state, s, annual, revenues, of, mughal, empire, were, around, 99, 000, 000, rupee, the, mughals, adopted, and, standardised, the, rupee, rupiya, or, silver, and, dam, copper, currencies, introduced, by, sur, emperor, sher, shah, suri, during, his, brief, rule, the, currency, was, initially, 48, dams, to, a, single, rupee, in, the, beginning, of, akbar, s, reign, before, it, later, became, 38, dams, to, a, rupee, in, the, 1580s, with, the, dam, s, value, rising, further, in, the, 17th, century, as, a, result, of, new, industrial, uses, for, copper, such, as, in, bronze, cannons, and, brass, utensils, the, dam, was, initially, the, most, common, coin, in, akbar, s, time, before, being, replaced, by, the, rupee, as, the, most, common, coin, in, succeeding, reigns, the, dam, s, value, was, later, worth, 30, to, a, rupee, towards, the, end, of, jahangir, s, reign, and, then, 16, to, a, rupee, by, the, 1660s, the, mughals, minted, coins, with, high, purity, never, dropping, below, 96, and, without, debasement, until, the, 1720s, despite, india, having, its, stocks, of, gold, and, silver, the, mughals, produced, minimal, gold, of, their, own, but, mostly, minted, coins, from, imported, bullion, as, a, result, of, the, empire, s, strong, export, driven, economy, with, global, demand, for, indian, agricultural, and, industrial, products, drawing, a, steady, stream, of, precious, metals, into, india, around, 80, of, mughal, india, s, imports, were, bullion, mostly, silver, with, major, sources, of, imported, bullion, including, the, new, world, and, japan, which, in, turn, imported, large, quantities, of, textiles, and, silk, from, the, bengal, subah, province, the, historian, shireen, moosvi, estimates, that, in, terms, of, contributions, to, the, mughal, economy, in, the, late, 16th, century, the, primary, sector, contributed, 52, the, secondary, sector, 18, and, the, tertiary, sector, 29, the, secondary, sector, contributed, a, higher, percentage, than, in, early, 20th, century, british, india, where, the, secondary, sector, only, contributed, 11, to, the, economy, in, terms, of, the, urban, rural, divide, 18, of, mughal, india, s, labour, force, were, urban, and, 82, were, rural, contributing, 52, and, 48, to, the, economy, respectively, according, to, stephen, broadberry, and, bishnupriya, gupta, grain, wages, in, india, were, comparable, to, england, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, but, diverged, in, the, 18th, century, when, they, fell, to, 20, 40, of, england, s, wages, this, however, is, disputed, by, parthasarathi, and, sivramkrishna, parthasarathi, cites, his, estimates, that, grain, wages, for, weaving, and, spinning, in, mid, 18th, century, bengal, and, south, india, were, comparable, to, britain, similarly, sivramkrishna, analyzed, agricultural, surveys, conducted, in, mysore, by, francis, buchanan, during, 1800, 1801, arrived, at, estimates, using, a, subsistence, basket, that, aggregated, millet, income, could, be, almost, five, times, subsistence, level, while, corresponding, rice, income, was, three, times, that, much, that, could, be, comparable, to, advance, part, of, europe, due, to, the, scarcity, of, data, however, more, research, is, needed, before, drawing, any, conclusion, according, to, moosvi, mughal, india, had, a, per, capita, income, in, terms, of, wheat, 1, 24, higher, in, the, late, 16th, century, than, british, india, did, in, the, early, 20th, century, this, income, however, would, have, to, be, revised, downwards, if, manufactured, goods, like, clothing, would, be, considered, compared, to, food, per, capita, expenditure, on, clothing, was, much, smaller, though, so, relative, income, between, 1595, and, 1596, should, be, comparable, to, 1901, 1910, however, in, a, system, where, wealth, was, hoarded, by, elites, wages, were, depressed, for, manual, labour, in, mughal, india, there, was, a, generally, tolerant, attitude, towards, manual, labourers, with, some, religious, cults, in, northern, india, proudly, asserting, a, high, status, for, manual, labour, while, slavery, also, existed, it, was, limited, largely, to, household, servants, indian, agricultural, production, increased, under, the, mughal, empire, a, variety, of, crops, were, grown, including, food, crops, such, as, wheat, rice, and, barley, and, non, food, cash, crops, such, as, cotton, indigo, and, opium, by, the, mid, 17th, century, indian, cultivators, began, to, extensively, grow, two, new, crops, from, the, americas, maize, and, tobacco, the, mughal, administration, emphasised, agrarian, reform, which, began, under, the, non, mughal, emperor, sher, shah, suri, the, work, of, which, akbar, adopted, and, furthered, with, more, reforms, the, civil, administration, was, organised, hierarchically, based, on, merit, with, promotions, based, on, performance, the, mughal, government, funded, the, building, of, irrigation, systems, across, the, empire, which, produced, much, higher, crop, yields, and, increased, the, net, revenue, base, leading, to, increased, agricultural, production, a, major, mughal, reform, introduced, by, akbar, was, a, new, land, revenue, system, called, zabt, he, replaced, the, tribute, system, previously, common, in, india, and, used, by, tokugawa, japan, at, the, time, with, a, monetary, tax, system, based, on, a, uniform, currency, the, revenue, system, was, biased, in, favour, of, higher, value, cash, crops, such, as, cotton, indigo, sugar, cane, tree, crops, and, opium, providing, state, incentives, to, grow, cash, crops, in, addition, to, rising, market, demand, under, the, zabt, system, the, mughals, also, conducted, extensive, cadastral, surveying, to, assess, the, area, of, land, under, plough, cultivation, with, the, mughal, state, encouraging, greater, land, cultivation, by, offering, tax, free, periods, to, those, who, brought, new, land, under, cultivation, the, expansion, of, agriculture, and, cultivation, continued, under, later, mughal, emperors, including, aurangzeb, whose, 1665, firman, edict, stated, the, entire, elevated, attention, and, desires, of, the, emperor, are, devoted, to, the, increase, in, the, population, and, cultivation, of, the, empire, and, the, welfare, of, the, whole, peasantry, and, the, entire, people, mughal, agriculture, was, in, some, ways, advanced, compared, to, european, agriculture, at, the, time, exemplified, by, the, common, use, of, the, seed, drill, among, indian, peasants, before, its, adoption, in, europe, while, the, average, peasant, across, the, world, was, only, skilled, in, growing, very, few, crops, the, average, indian, peasant, was, skilled, in, growing, a, wide, variety, of, food, and, non, food, crops, increasing, their, productivity, indian, peasants, were, also, quick, to, adapt, to, profitable, new, crops, such, as, maize, and, tobacco, from, the, new, world, being, rapidly, adopted, and, widely, cultivated, across, mughal, india, between, 1600, and, 1650, bengali, farmers, rapidly, learned, techniques, of, mulberry, cultivation, and, sericulture, establishing, bengal, subah, as, a, major, silk, producing, region, of, the, world, sugar, mills, appeared, in, india, shortly, before, the, mughal, era, evidence, for, the, use, of, a, draw, bar, for, sugar, milling, appears, at, delhi, in, 1540, but, may, also, date, back, earlier, and, was, mainly, used, in, the, northern, indian, subcontinent, geared, sugar, rolling, mills, first, appeared, in, mughal, india, using, the, principle, of, rollers, as, well, as, worm, gearing, by, the, 17th, century, according, to, economic, historian, immanuel, wallerstein, citing, evidence, from, irfan, habib, percival, spear, and, ashok, desai, per, capita, agricultural, output, and, standards, of, consumption, in, 17th, century, mughal, india, were, probably, higher, than, in, 17th, century, europe, and, certainly, higher, than, early, 20th, century, british, india, the, increased, agricultural, productivity, led, to, lower, food, prices, in, turn, this, benefited, the, indian, textile, industry, compared, to, britain, the, price, of, grain, was, about, one, half, in, south, india, and, one, third, in, bengal, in, terms, of, silver, coinage, this, resulted, in, lower, silver, coin, prices, for, indian, textiles, giving, them, a, price, advantage, in, global, markets, south, asia, during, the, mughal, s, rule, was, a, very, fertile, ground, for, manufacturing, technologies, which, coveted, by, the, europeans, before, the, industrial, revolution, up, until, 1750, india, produced, about, 25, of, the, world, s, industrial, output, manufactured, goods, and, cash, crops, from, the, mughal, empire, were, sold, throughout, the, world, key, industries, included, textiles, shipbuilding, and, steel, processed, products, included, cotton, textiles, yarns, thread, silk, jute, products, metalware, and, foods, such, as, sugar, oils, and, butter, the, growth, of, manufacturing, industries, in, the, indian, subcontinent, during, the, mughal, era, in, the, 17th, 18th, centuries, has, been, referred, to, as, a, form, of, proto, industrialization, similar, to, 18th, century, western, europe, before, the, industrial, revolution, in, early, modern, europe, there, was, significant, demand, for, products, from, mughal, india, particularly, cotton, textiles, as, well, as, goods, such, as, spices, peppers, indigo, silks, and, saltpetre, for, use, in, munitions, european, fashion, for, example, became, increasingly, dependent, on, mughal, indian, textiles, and, silks, from, the, late, 17th, century, to, the, early, 18th, century, mughal, india, accounted, for, 95, of, british, imports, from, asia, and, the, bengal, subah, province, alone, accounted, for, 40, of, dutch, imports, from, asia, in, contrast, there, was, very, little, demand, for, european, goods, in, mughal, india, which, was, largely, self, sufficient, thus, europeans, had, very, little, to, offer, except, for, some, woollens, unprocessed, metals, and, a, few, luxury, items, the, trade, imbalance, caused, europeans, to, export, large, quantities, of, gold, and, silver, to, mughal, india, to, pay, for, south, asian, imports, indian, goods, especially, those, from, bengal, were, also, exported, in, large, quantities, to, other, asian, markets, such, as, indonesia, and, japan, the, largest, manufacturing, industry, in, the, mughal, empire, was, textile, manufacturing, particularly, cotton, textile, manufacturing, which, included, the, production, of, piece, goods, calicos, and, muslins, available, unbleached, and, in, a, variety, of, colours, the, cotton, textile, industry, was, responsible, for, a, large, part, of, the, empire, s, international, trade, india, had, a, 25, share, of, the, global, textile, trade, in, the, early, 18th, century, indian, cotton, textiles, were, the, most, important, manufactured, goods, in, world, trade, in, the, 18th, century, consumed, across, the, world, from, the, americas, to, japan, by, the, early, 18th, century, mughal, indian, textiles, were, clothing, people, across, the, indian, subcontinent, southeast, asia, europe, the, americas, africa, and, the, middle, east, the, most, important, centre, of, cotton, production, was, the, bengal, province, particularly, around, its, capital, city, of, dhaka, bengal, accounted, for, more, than, 50, of, textiles, and, around, 80, of, silks, imported, by, the, dutch, from, asia, bengali, silk, and, cotton, textiles, were, exported, in, large, quantities, to, europe, indonesia, and, japan, 202, and, bengali, muslin, textiles, from, dhaka, were, sold, in, central, asia, where, they, were, known, as, dhaka, textiles, indian, textiles, dominated, the, indian, ocean, trade, for, centuries, were, sold, in, the, atlantic, ocean, trade, and, had, a, 38, share, of, the, west, african, trade, in, the, early, 18th, century, while, indian, calicos, were, a, major, force, in, europe, and, indian, textiles, accounted, for, 20, of, total, english, trade, with, southern, europe, in, the, early, 18th, century, the, worm, gear, roller, cotton, gin, which, was, invented, in, india, during, the, early, delhi, sultanate, era, of, the, 13th, 14th, centuries, came, into, use, in, the, mughal, empire, sometime, around, the, 16th, century, and, is, still, used, in, india, through, to, the, present, day, another, innovation, the, incorporation, of, the, crank, handle, in, the, cotton, gin, first, appeared, in, india, sometime, during, the, late, delhi, sultanate, or, the, early, mughal, empire, the, production, of, cotton, which, may, have, largely, been, spun, in, the, villages, and, then, taken, to, towns, in, the, form, of, yarn, to, be, woven, into, cloth, textiles, was, advanced, by, the, diffusion, of, the, spinning, wheel, across, india, shortly, before, the, mughal, era, lowering, the, costs, of, yarn, and, helping, to, increase, demand, for, cotton, the, diffusion, of, the, spinning, wheel, and, the, incorporation, of, the, worm, gear, and, crank, handle, into, the, roller, cotton, gin, led, to, greatly, expanded, indian, cotton, textile, production, during, the, mughal, era, once, the, mughal, emperor, akbar, asked, his, courtiers, which, was, the, most, beautiful, flower, some, said, rose, from, whose, petals, were, distilled, the, precious, ittar, others, the, lotus, glory, of, every, indian, village, but, birbal, said, the, cotton, boll, there, was, a, scornful, laughter, and, akbar, asked, for, an, explanation, birbal, said, your, majesty, from, the, cotton, boll, comes, the, fine, fabric, prized, by, merchants, across, the, seas, that, has, made, your, empire, famous, throughout, the, world, the, perfume, of, your, fame, far, exceeds, the, scent, of, roses, and, jasmine, that, is, why, i, say, the, cotton, boll, is, the, most, beautiful, flower, the, bengal, subah, province, was, especially, prosperous, from, the, time, of, its, takeover, by, the, mughals, in, 1590, until, the, british, east, india, company, seized, control, in, 1757, historian, c, a, bayly, wrote, that, it, was, probably, the, mughal, empire, s, wealthiest, province, domestically, much, of, india, depended, on, bengali, products, such, as, rice, silks, and, cotton, textiles, overseas, europeans, depended, on, bengali, products, such, as, cotton, textiles, silks, and, opium, bengal, accounted, for, 40, of, dutch, imports, from, asia, for, example, including, more, than, 50, of, textiles, and, around, 80, of, silks, from, bengal, saltpetre, was, also, shipped, to, europe, opium, was, sold, in, indonesia, raw, silk, was, exported, to, japan, and, the, netherlands, and, cotton, and, silk, textiles, were, exported, to, europe, indonesia, and, japan, akbar, played, a, key, role, in, establishing, bengal, as, a, leading, economic, centre, as, he, began, transforming, many, of, the, jungles, there, into, farms, as, soon, as, he, conquered, the, region, he, brought, tools, and, men, to, clear, jungles, to, expand, cultivation, and, brought, sufis, to, open, the, jungles, to, farming, bengal, was, later, described, as, the, paradise, of, nations, by, mughal, emperors, the, mughals, introduced, agrarian, reforms, including, the, modern, bengali, calendar, the, calendar, played, a, vital, role, in, developing, and, organising, harvests, tax, collection, and, bengali, culture, in, general, including, the, new, year, and, autumn, festivals, the, province, was, a, leading, producer, of, grains, salt, fruits, liquors, and, wines, precious, metals, and, ornaments, after, akbar, there, are, notable, contributive, factor, during, the, era, of, aurangzeb, as, siddiqui, m, azizuddin, hussein, from, jamia, millia, islamia, and, maulana, azad, national, urdu, university, has, viewed, that, aside, from, religious, and, legal, context, fatawa, alamgiri, codex, has, provided, direct, contribution, to, the, proto, industrialization, in, bengal, subah, after, 150, years, of, rule, by, mughal, viceroys, bengal, gained, semi, independence, as, a, dominion, under, the, nawab, of, bengal, in, 1717, the, nawabs, permitted, european, companies, to, set, up, trading, posts, across, the, region, including, firms, from, britain, france, the, netherlands, denmark, portugal, and, austria, an, armenian, community, dominated, banking, and, shipping, in, major, cities, and, towns, the, europeans, regarded, bengal, as, the, richest, place, for, trade, by, the, late, 18th, century, the, british, displaced, the, mughal, ruling, class, in, bengal, mughal, india, had, a, large, shipbuilding, industry, which, was, also, largely, centred, in, the, bengal, province, economic, historian, indrajit, ray, estimates, the, shipbuilding, output, of, bengal, during, the, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, centuries, at, 223, 250, tons, annually, compared, with, 23, 061, tons, produced, in, nineteen, colonies, in, north, america, from, 1769, to, 1771, he, also, assesses, ship, repairing, as, very, advanced, in, bengal, an, important, innovation, in, shipbuilding, was, the, introduction, of, a, flushed, deck, design, in, bengal, rice, ships, resulting, in, hulls, that, were, stronger, and, less, prone, to, leak, than, the, structurally, weak, hulls, of, traditional, european, ships, built, with, a, stepped, deck, design, the, british, east, india, company, later, duplicated, the, flushed, deck, and, hull, designs, of, bengal, rice, ships, in, the, 1760s, leading, to, significant, improvements, in, seaworthiness, and, navigation, for, european, ships, during, the, industrial, revolution, india, s, population, growth, accelerated, under, the, mughal, empire, with, an, unprecedented, economic, and, demographic, upsurge, which, boosted, the, indian, population, by, 60, to, 253, in, 200, years, during, 1500, 1700, the, indian, population, had, a, faster, growth, during, the, mughal, era, than, at, any, known, point, in, indian, history, before, the, mughal, era, by, the, time, of, aurangzeb, s, reign, there, were, a, total, of, 455, 698, villages, in, the, mughal, empire, the, following, table, gives, population, estimates, for, the, mughal, empire, compared, to, the, total, population, of, south, asia, including, the, regions, of, modern, india, pakistan, and, bangladesh, and, compared, to, the, world, population, according, to, irfan, habib, cities, and, towns, boomed, under, the, mughal, empire, which, had, a, relatively, high, degree, of, urbanization, for, its, time, with, 15, of, its, population, living, in, urban, centres, this, was, higher, than, the, percentage, of, the, urban, population, in, contemporary, europe, at, the, time, and, higher, than, that, of, british, india, in, the, 19th, century, the, level, of, urbanization, in, europe, did, not, reach, 15, until, the, 19th, century, under, akbar, s, reign, in, 1600, the, mughal, empire, s, urban, population, was, up, to, 17, million, people, 15, of, the, empire, s, total, population, this, was, larger, than, the, entire, urban, population, in, europe, at, the, time, and, even, a, century, later, in, 1700, the, urban, population, of, england, scotland, and, wales, did, not, exceed, 13, of, its, total, population, while, british, india, had, an, urban, population, that, was, under, 13, of, its, total, population, in, 1800, and, 9, in, 1881, a, decline, from, the, earlier, mughal, era, by, 1700, mughal, india, had, an, urban, population, of, 23, million, people, larger, than, british, india, s, urban, population, of, 22, 3, million, in, 1871, those, estimates, were, criticised, by, tim, dyson, who, consider, them, exaggerations, according, to, dyson, urbanization, of, the, mughal, empire, was, less, than, 9, the, historian, nizamuddin, ahmad, 1551, 1621, reported, that, under, akbar, s, reign, there, were, 120, large, cities, and, 3200, townships, a, number, of, cities, in, india, had, a, population, between, a, quarter, million, and, half, million, people, with, larger, cities, including, agra, in, agra, subah, with, up, to, 800, 000, people, lahore, in, lahore, subah, with, up, to, 700, 000, people, dhaka, in, bengal, subah, with, over, 1, million, people, and, delhi, in, delhi, subah, with, over, 600, 000, people, cities, acted, as, markets, for, the, sale, of, goods, and, provided, homes, for, a, variety, of, merchants, traders, shopkeepers, artisans, moneylenders, weavers, craftspeople, officials, and, religious, figures, however, several, cities, were, military, and, political, centres, rather, than, manufacturing, or, commerce, centres, generally, classical, historiographies, depicted, the, mughal, empire, s, origin, was, a, sedentarized, agrarian, society, however, modern, historians, such, as, andr, wink, jos, j, l, gommans, anatoly, khazanov, thomas, j, barfield, and, others, argued, the, mughals, was, originated, from, nomadic, culture, pius, malekandathil, argued, instead, that, although, it, was, true, that, the, mughal, has, their, origin, as, nomadic, civilization, they, became, more, sendentarized, as, the, time, passed, as, exemplified, by, their, military, tradition, the, mughal, empire, was, definitive, in, the, early, modern, and, modern, periods, of, south, asian, history, with, its, legacy, in, india, pakistan, bangladesh, and, afghanistan, seen, in, cultural, contributions, such, as, the, procession, of, marriage, among,
