traditional, the, history, of, hinduism, covers, a, wide, variety, of, related, religious, traditions, native, to, the, indian, subcontinent, it, overlaps, or, coincides, with, the, development, of, religion, in, the, indian, subcontinent, since, the, iron, age, with, some, of, its, traditions, tracing, back, to, prehistoric, religions, such, as, those, of, the, bronze, age, indus, valley, civilisation, hinduism, has, been, called, the, oldest, religion, in, the, world, but, scholars, regard, hinduism, as, a, relatively, recent, synthesis, of, various, indian, cultures, and, traditions, with, diverse, roots, and, no, single, founder, which, emerged, around, the, beginning, of, the, common, era, the, history, of, hinduism, is, often, divided, into, periods, of, development, the, first, period, is, the, pre, vedic, period, which, includes, the, indus, valley, civilization, and, local, pre, historic, religions, northern, india, had, the, vedic, period, with, the, introduction, of, the, historical, vedic, religion, sometimes, called, vedic, hinduism, or, ancient, hinduism, by, the, indo, aryan, migrations, starting, somewhere, between, 1900, bce, and, 1400, bce, the, subsequent, period, of, the, second, urbanisation, 600, 200, bce, is, a, formative, period, for, hinduism, jainism, and, buddhism, followed, by, a, turning, point, between, the, vedic, religion, and, hindu, religions, during, the, epic, and, early, puranic, period, c, 200, bce, to, 500, ce, when, the, epics, and, the, first, pur, nas, were, composed, this, was, followed, by, the, classical, golden, age, of, hinduism, c, 320, 650, ce, which, coincides, with, the, gupta, empire, in, this, period, the, six, branches, of, hindu, philosophy, evolved, namely, samkhya, yoga, nyaya, vaisheshika, m, m, s, and, ved, nta, monotheistic, sects, like, shaivism, and, vaishnavism, developed, during, this, same, period, through, the, bhakti, movement, it, flourished, in, the, medieval, period, period, from, roughly, 650, to, 1100, ce, which, forms, the, late, classical, period, or, early, middle, ages, with, the, decline, of, buddhism, in, india, and, the, establishment, of, classical, puranic, hinduism, is, established, hinduism, under, both, hindu, and, islamic, rulers, from, c, 1200, to, 1750, ce, saw, the, increasing, prominence, of, the, bhakti, movement, which, remains, influential, today, adi, shankara, became, glorified, as, the, main, proponent, of, advaita, vedanta, in, response, to, the, success, of, vaishnavite, bhakti, the, colonial, period, saw, the, emergence, of, various, hindu, reform, movements, partly, inspired, by, western, movements, such, as, unitarianism, and, theosophy, the, partition, of, india, in, 1947, was, along, religious, lines, with, the, republic, of, india, emerging, with, a, hindu, majority, during, the, 20th, century, due, to, the, indian, diaspora, hindu, minorities, have, formed, in, all, continents, with, the, largest, communities, in, absolute, numbers, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, while, the, puranic, chronology, presents, a, genealogy, of, thousands, of, years, scholars, regard, hinduism, as, a, fusion, or, synthesis, of, various, indian, cultures, and, traditions, among, its, roots, are, the, historical, vedic, religion, itself, already, the, product, of, a, composite, of, the, indo, aryan, and, harappan, cultures, and, civilizations, which, evolved, into, the, brahmanical, religion, and, ideology, of, the, kuru, kingdom, of, iron, age, northern, india, but, also, the, rama, a, or, renouncer, traditions, of, northeast, india, and, mesolithic, and, neolithic, cultures, of, india, such, as, the, religions, of, the, indus, valley, civilisation, dravidian, traditions, and, the, local, traditions, and, tribal, religions, this, hindu, synthesis, emerged, after, the, vedic, period, between, 500, 200, bce, and, c, 300, ce, in, the, period, of, the, second, urbanisation, and, the, early, classical, period, of, hinduism, when, the, epics, and, the, first, puranas, were, composed, this, brahmanical, synthesis, incorporated, rama, ic, and, buddhist, influences, and, the, emerging, bhakti, tradition, into, the, brahmanical, fold, via, the, smriti, literature, this, synthesis, emerged, under, the, pressure, of, the, success, of, buddhism, and, jainism, during, the, gupta, reign, the, first, puranas, were, written, which, were, used, to, disseminate, mainstream, religious, ideology, amongst, pre, literate, and, tribal, groups, undergoing, acculturation, the, resulting, puranic, hinduism, differed, markedly, from, the, earlier, brahmanism, of, the, dharmasutras, and, the, smritis, hinduism, co, existed, for, several, centuries, with, buddhism, to, finally, gain, the, upper, hand, at, all, levels, in, the, 8th, century, from, northern, india, this, hindu, synthesis, and, its, societal, divisions, spread, to, southern, india, and, parts, of, southeast, asia, as, courts, and, rulers, adopted, the, brahmanical, culture, it, was, aided, by, the, settlement, of, brahmins, on, land, granted, by, local, rulers, the, incorporation, and, assimilation, of, popular, non, vedic, gods, and, the, process, of, sanskritization, in, which, people, from, many, strata, of, society, throughout, the, subcontinent, tended, to, adapt, their, religious, and, social, life, to, brahmanic, norms, this, process, of, assimilation, explains, the, wide, diversity, of, local, cultures, in, india, half, shrouded, in, a, taddered, cloak, of, conceptual, unity, according, to, eliot, deutsch, brahmins, played, an, essential, role, in, the, development, of, this, synthesis, they, were, bilingual, and, bicultural, speaking, both, their, local, language, and, popular, sanskrit, which, transcended, regional, differences, in, culture, and, language, they, were, able, to, translate, the, mainstream, of, the, large, culture, in, terms, of, the, village, and, the, culture, of, the, village, in, terms, of, the, mainstream, thereby, integrating, the, local, culture, into, a, larger, whole, while, vaidikas, and, to, a, lesser, degree, smartas, remained, faithful, to, the, traditional, vedic, lore, a, new, brahminism, arose, which, composed, litanies, for, the, local, and, regional, gods, and, became, the, ministers, of, these, local, traditions, authors, on, hinduism, and, its, history, have, used, various, periodisations, elaborating, on, influential, periodisations, like, mill, s, and, also, describing, some, of, the, constituting, traditions, preceding, the, hindu, synthesis, an, elaborate, periodisation, may, be, as, follows, notes, smart, and, michaels, seem, to, follow, mill, s, periodisation, michaels, mentions, flood, 1996, as, a,

paintings, of, bhimbetka, rock, shelters, which, are, about, 10, 000, years, old, c, 8, 000, bce, as, well, as, neolithic, times, at, least, some, of, these, shelters, were, occupied, over, 100, 000,

people, worshipped, a, mother, goddess, symbolizing, fertility, a, common, practice, among, rural, hindus, even, today, however, this, view, has, been, disputed, by, s, clark, who, sees, it, as, an, inadequate, explanation, of, the, function, and, construction, of, many, of, the, figurines, there, are, no, religious, buildings, or, evidence, of, elaborate, burials, if, there, were, temples, they, have, not, been, identified, however, house, 1, in, hr, a, area, in, mohenjo, daro, s, lower, town, has, been, identified, as, a, possible, temple, the, historical, vedic, religion, also, known, as, vedicism, and, vedism, sometimes, referred, to, as, an, early, phase, of, hinduism, called, vedic, hinduism, and, ancient, hinduism, was, the, sacrificial, religion, of, the, early, indo, aryans, speakers, of, early, old, indic, dialects, ultimately, deriving, from, the, proto, indo, iranian, peoples, of, the, bronze, age, who, lived, on, the, central, asian, steppes, the, vedic, period, named, after, the, vedic, religion, of, the, indo, aryans, of, the, kuru, kingdom, 1200, bce, 525, bce, lasted, from, c, 1750, to, 500, bce, the, indo, aryans, were, a, branch, of, the, indo, european, language, family, which, many, scholars, believe, originated, in, kurgan, culture, of, the, central, asian, steppes, indeed, the, ancient, vedic, religion, including, the, names, of, certain, deities, was, in, essence, a, branch, of, the, same, religious, tradition, as, the, ancient, greeks, romans, persians, and, germanic, peoples, for, example, the, vedic, god, dyaus, is, a, variant, of, the, proto, indo, european, god, dy, us, ph, 2, ter, or, simply, dy, us, from, which, also, derive, the, greek, zeus, and, the, roman, jupiter, similarly, the, vedic, manu, and, yama, derive, from, the, proto, indo, european, manu, and, yemo, from, which, also, derive, the, germanic, mannus, and, ymir, according, to, the, indo, european, migration, theory, the, indo, iranians, were, the, common, ancestor, of, the, indo, aryans, and, the, proto, iranians, the, indo, iranians, split, into, the, indo, aryans, and, iranians, around, 1800, 1600, bce, the, indo, aryans, were, pastoralists, who, migrated, into, north, western, india, after, the, collapse, of, the, indus, valley, civilization, the, indo, aryans, were, a, branch, of, the, indo, iranians, which, originated, in, the, andronovo, culture, in, the, bactria, margiana, era, in, present, northern, afghanistan, the, roots, of, this, culture, go, back, further, to, the, sintashta, culture, with, funeral, sacrifices, which, show, close, parallels, to, the, sacrificial, funeral, rites, of, the, rigveda, although, some, early, depictions, of, deities, seem, to, appear, in, the, art, of, the, indus, valley, civilisation, very, few, religious, artifacts, remain, from, the, period, corresponding, to, the, indo, aryan, migration, during, the, vedic, period, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, early, vedic, religion, focused, exclusively, on, the, worship, of, purely, elementary, forces, of, nature, by, means, of, elaborate, sacrifices, which, did, not, lend, themselves, easily, to, anthropomorphological, representations, various, artefacts, may, belong, to, the, copper, hoard, culture, 2nd, millennium, ce, some, of, them, suggesting, anthropomorphological, characteristics, interpretations, vary, as, to, the, exact, signification, of, these, artifacts, or, even, the, culture, and, the, periodization, to, which, they, belonged, during, the, early, vedic, period, c, 1500, 1100, bce, indo, aryan, tribes, were, pastoralists, in, north, west, india, after, 1100, bce, with, the, introduction, of, iron, the, indo, aryan, tribes, moved, into, the, western, ganges, plain, adopting, an, agrarian, lifestyle, rudimentary, state, forms, appeared, of, which, the, kuru, tribe, and, realm, was, the, most, influential, it, was, a, tribal, union, which, developed, into, the, first, recorded, state, level, society, in, south, asia, around, 1000, bce, it, decisively, changed, their, religious, heritage, of, the, early, vedic, period, collecting, their, ritual, hymns, into, the, veda, collections, and, developing, new, rituals, which, gained, their, position, in, indian, civilization, as, the, orthodox, rauta, rituals, which, contributed, to, the, so, called, classical, synthesis, or, hindu, synthesis, who, really, knows, who, will, here, proclaim, it, whence, was, it, produced, whence, is, this, creation, the, gods, came, afterwards, with, the, creation, of, this, universe, who, then, knows, whence, it, has, arisen, the, indo, aryans, brought, with, them, their, language, and, religion, the, indo, aryan, and, vedic, beliefs, and, practices, of, the, pre, classical, era, were, closely, related, to, the, hypothesised, proto, indo, european, religion, and, the, indo, iranian, religion, according, to, anthony, the, old, indic, religion, probably, emerged, among, indo, european, immigrants, in, the, contact, zone, between, the, zeravshan, river, present, day, uzbekistan, and, present, day, iran, it, was, a, syncretic, mixture, of, old, central, asian, and, new, indo, european, elements, which, borrowed, distinctive, religious, beliefs, and, practices, from, the, bactria, margiana, culture, at, least, 383, non, indo, european, words, were, borrowed, from, this, culture, including, the, god, indra, and, the, ritual, drink, soma, according, to, anthony, many, of, the, qualities, of, indo, iranian, god, of, might, victory, verethragna, were, transferred, to, the, adopted, god, indra, who, became, the, central, deity, of, the, developing, old, indic, culture, indra, was, the, subject, of, 250, hymns, a, quarter, of, the, rig, veda, he, was, associated, more, than, any, other, deity, with, soma, a, stimulant, drug, perhaps, derived, from, ephedra, probably, borrowed, from, the, bmac, religion, his, rise, to, prominence, was, a, peculiar, trait, of, the, old, indic, speakers, the, oldest, inscriptions, in, old, indic, the, language, of, the, rig, veda, are, found, not, in, northwestern, india, and, pakistan, but, in,

the, early, centuries, ce, it, is, reflected, in, the, process, of, sanskritization, a, process, in, which, people, from, many, strata, of, society, throughout, the, subcontinent, tended, to, adapt, their, religious, and, social, life, to, brahmanic, norms, it, is, reflected, in, the, tendency, to, identify, local, deities, with, the, gods, of, the, sanskrit, texts, the, brahmins, response, of, assimilation, and, consolidation, is, reflected, in, the, smriti, literature, which, took, shape, in, this, period, the, smriti, texts, of, the, period, between, 200, bce, and, 100, ce, proclaim, the, authority, of, the, vedas, and, acceptance, of, the, vedas, became, a, central, criterion, for, defining, hinduism, over, and, against, the, heterodoxies, which, rejected, the, vedas, most, of, the,

the, changing, multiplicity, of, forms, and, objects, as, the, final, reality, is, regarded, as, maya, illusion, obscuring, the, unchanging, ultimate, reality, of, brahman, while, shankara, has, an, unparalleled, status, in, the, history, of, advaita, vedanta, shankara, s, early, influence, in, india, is, doubtful, until, the, 11th, century, vedanta, itself, was, a, peripheral, school, of, thought, and, until, the, 10th, century, shankara, himself, was, overshadowed, by, his, older, contemporary, ma, ana, mi, ra, who, was, considered, to, be, the, major, representative, of, advaita, several, scholars, suggest, that, the, historical, fame, and, cultural, influence, of, shankara, and, advaita, vedanta, grew, only, centuries, later, during, the, era, of, the, muslim, invasions, and, consequent, devastation, of, india, due, to, the, efforts, of, vidyaranya, 14th, c, who, created, legends, to, turn, shankara, into, a, divine, folk, hero, who, spread, his, teaching, through, his, digvijaya, universal, conquest, all, over, india, like, a, victorious, conqueror, shankara, s, position, was, further, established, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, when, neo, vedantins, and,

acceptance, in, indian, culture, and, beyond, as, the, paradigmatic, example, of, hindu, spirituality, shankara, became, an, iconic, representation, of, hindu, religion, and, culture, despite, the,
