great, moravia, latin, regnum, marahensium, greek, megh, l, morav, a, czech, velk, morava, slovak, ve, k, morava, polish, wielkie, morawy, german, gro, m, hren, or, simply, moravia, was, the, first, major, state, that, was, predominantly, west, slavic, to, emerge, in, the, area, of, central, europe, possibly, including, territories, which, are, today, part, of, the, czech, republic, slovakia, hungary, austria, germany, poland, romania, croatia, serbia, ukraine, and, slovenia, the, formations, preceding, it, in, these, territories, were, samo, s, tribal, union, 631, 658, and, the, pannonian, avar, state, 567, after, 822, its, core, territory, is, the, region, now, called, moravia, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, czech, republic, alongside, the, morava, river, which, gave, its, name, to, the, kingdom, the, kingdom, saw, the, rise, of, the, first, ever, slavic, literary, culture, in, the, old, church, slavonic, language, as, well, as, the, expansion, of, christianity, first, via, missionaries, from, east, francia, and, later, after, the, arrival, of, saints, cyril, and, methodius, in, 863, and, the, creation, of, the, glagolitic, alphabet, the, first, alphabet, dedicated, to, a, slavic, language, glagolitic, was, subsequently, replaced, by, the, cyrillic, alphabet, created, in, the, first, bulgarian, empire, although, the, borders, of, this, empire, cannot, be, exactly, determined, moravia, reached, its, largest, territorial, extent, under, prince, svatopluk, i, slovak, sv, topluk, who, ruled, from, 870, to, 894, separatism, and, internal, conflicts, emerging, after, svatopluk, s, death, contributed, to, the, fall, of, great, moravia, which, was, overrun, by, the, hungarians, who, then, included, the, territory, of, present, day, slovakia, in, their, domains, the, exact, date, of, moravia, s, collapse, is, unknown, but, it, occurred, between, 902, and, 907, moravia, experienced, significant, cultural, development, under, king, rastislav, with, the, arrival, in, 863, of, the, mission, of, saints, cyril, and, methodius, after, his, request, for, missionaries, had, been, refused, in, rome, rastislav, asked, the, byzantine, emperor, to, send, a, teacher, u, ite, to, introduce, literacy, and, a, legal, system, prav, da, to, great, moravia, the, request, was, granted, the, missionary, brothers, cyril, and, methodius, introduced, a, system, of, writing, the, glagolitic, alphabet, and, slavonic, liturgy, the, latter, eventually, formally, approved, by, pope, adrian, ii, the, glagolitic, script, was, probably, invented, by, cyril, himself, and, the, language, he, used, for, his, translations, of, religious, texts, and, his, original, literary, creation, was, based, on, the, eastern, south, slavic, dialect, he, and, his, brother, methodius, knew, from, their, native, thessaloniki, old, church, slavonic, therefore, differed, somewhat, from, the, local, slavic, dialect, of, great, moravia, which, was, the, ancestral, idiom, to, the, later, dialects, spoken, in, moravia, and, western, slovakia, later, the, disciples, of, cyril, and, methodius, were, expelled, from, great, moravia, by, king, svatopluk, i, who, re, orientated, the, empire, to, western, christianity, the, meaning, of, the, name, of, great, moravia, has, been, subject, to, debate, the, designation, great, moravia, megale, moravia, in, greek, stems, from, the, work, de, administrando, imperio, written, by, the, byzantine, emperor, constantine, vii, porphyrogenitos, around, 950, the, emperor, only, used, the, adjective, megale, in, connection, with, the, polity, when, referring, to, events, that, occurred, after, its, fall, implying, that, it, should, rather, be, translated, as, old, instead, of, great, according, to, a, third, theory, the, megale, adjective, refers, to, a, territory, located, beyond, the, borders, of, the, byzantine, empire, finally, the, historian, lubom, r, e, havl, k, writes, that, byzantine, scholars, used, this, adjective, when, referring, to, homelands, of, nomadic, peoples, as, demonstrated, by, the, term, great, bulgaria, is, belgrade, in, which, is, the, tower, of, the, holy, and, great, constantine, the, emperor, then, again, at, the, running, back, of, the, river, is, the, renowned, sirmium, by, name, a, journey, of, two, days, from, belgrade, and, beyond, lies, great, moravia, the, unbaptized, which, the, have, blotted, out, but, over, which, in, former, days, used, to, rule, such, are, the, landmarks, and, names, along, the, danube, river, the, work, of, porphyrogenitos, is, the, only, nearly, contemporaneous, source, using, the, adjective, great, in, connection, with, moravia, other, documents, from, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, never, used, the, term, in, this, context, instead, they, mention, the, polity, as, moravian, realm, or, realm, of, moravians, regnum, marahensium, terra, marahensium, regnum, marahavorum, regnum, marauorum, terra, marauorum, or, regnum, margorum, in, latin, and, morav, ska, oblast, in, old, church, slavonic, simply, moravia, marawa, marauia, and, maraha, in, latin, morava, marava, or, murava, in, old, church, slavonic, and, m, awa, t, in, arabic, also, regnum, sclavorum, realm, of, slavs, or, alternate, regnum, rastizi, realm, of, rastislav, or, regnum, zuentibaldi, realm, of, svatopluk, morava, is, the, czech, and, slovak, name, for, both, the, river, and, the, country, presumably, the, river, name, being, primary, and, giving, name, to, the, surrounding, country, the, ending, ava, as, in, many, other, czech, and, slovak, rivers, is, most, often, regarded, as, slavicization, of, the, originally, germanic, ahwa, modern, german, au, or, a, cognate, to, latin, aqua, some, scholars, again, link, it, via, celtic, ab, to, indo, european, pie, apa, opa, water, sea, the, root, mor, might, be, also, connected, with, other, indo, european, words, with, the, meaning, of, water, lake, or, sea, sea, slavic, more, latin, mare, welsh, m, r, german, meer, humidity, english, and, german, moor, slavic, mokr, compare, also, other, river, names, like, mur, in, austria, and, another, morava, in, serbia, etc, after, the, fall, of, great, moravia, the, central, territory, of, great, moravia, was, gradually, divided, into, the, newly, ascending, kingdom, of, bohemia, and, hungarian, kingdom, the, frontier, was, originally, settled, on, the, morava, river, however, from, the, 12th, century, the, czech, kings, managed, to, gain, more, and, more, of, the, region, on, the, eastern, bank, eventually, gaining, the, whole, stretch, of, the, eastern, territory, from, uhersk, hradi, t, down, to, str, nice, along, the, white, carpathians, the, original, core, territory, of, great, moravia, nowadays, forming, the, eastern, part, of, moravia, and, situated, between, the, white, carpathians, and, the, ch, iby, mountains, has, retained, its, non, czech, identity, in, its, designation, slov, cko, which, shows, common, origins, with, the, name, of, the, neighbouring, slovakia, a, token, of, a, past, shared, identity, in, great, moravian, times, this, core, region, of, great, moravia, along, the, river, has, retained, a, unique, culture, with, a, rich, folklore, tradition, the, above, mentioned, slov, cko, stretches, to, the, south, where, the, morava, river, forms, the, czech, slovak, frontier, into, two, regions, the, z, lu, region, on, the, morava, s, western, czech, bank, and, z, horie, on, its, eastern, slovak, bank, z, horie, also, boasts, the, only, surviving, building, from, great, moravian, times, the, chapel, at, kop, any, just, across, the, morava, from, the, archaeological, site, of, mikul, ice, these, two, important, great, moravian, places, are, now, connected, by, a, bridge, the, core, of, great, moravia, was, extended, according, to, annals, in, the, early, 830s, when, mojmir, i, of, moravia, conquered, the, neighbouring, principality, of, nitra, present, day, western, slovakia, the, former, principality, of, nitra, was, used, as, what, is, termed, in, slovak, deln, knie, atsvo, or, the, territory, given, to, and, ruled, by, the, successor, to, the, throne, traditionally, the, ruling, k, nendz, prince, s, sister, s, son, nevertheless, the, extent, and, even, the, very, location, of, great, moravia, historiographical, terms, as, its, original, formal, name, is, unknown, are, a, subject, of, debate, rival, theories, place, its, centre, south, of, the, danube, the, morava, in, serbia, or, on, the, great, hungarian, plain, the, exact, date, when, the, moravian, state, was, founded, is, also, disputed, but, it, probably, occurred, in, the, early, 830s, under, prince, mojm, r, i, r, 820s, 830s, 846, the, first, known, ruler, of, the, united, moravia, mojm, r, and, his, successor, rastislav, rostislav, in, czech, who, ruled, from, 846, to, 870, initially, acknowledged, the, suzerainty, of, the, carolingian, monarchs, but, the, moravian, fight, for, independence, caused, a, series, of, armed, conflicts, with, east, francia, from, the, 840s, according, to, most, historians, the, core, territories, of, moravia, were, located, in, the, valley, of, the, river, morava, today, in, present, day, czech, republic, and, slovakia, archaeological, findings, of, large, early, medieval, fortresses, and, the, significant, cluster, of, settlements, growing, around, them, suggest, that, an, important, centre, of, power, emerged, in, this, region, in, the, 9th, century, early, sources, alfred, the, great, s, contemporaneous, translation, of, orosius, s, history, of, the, world, which, mentioned, moravia, s, neighbours, and, the, description, of, the, travel, of, cyril, and, methodius, from, moravia, to, venice, through, pannonia, in, the, life, of, cyril, also, substantiate, the, traditional, view, these, maroara, have, to, the, west, of, them, the, thyringas, and, some, behemas, and, half, the, begware, and, south, them, on, the, other, side, of, the, danube, river, is, the, land, carendre, extending, south, as, far, as, the, mountains, called, the, alps, to, the, east, of, the, land, carendre, beyond, the, uninhabited, district, is, the, land, of, the, pulgare, and, east, of, that, is, the, land, of, greeks, to, the, east, of, the, land, of, maroara, is, the, land, of, the, vistula, and, east, of, that, are, those, datia, who, were, formerly, goths, the, borders, of, moravia, cannot, exactly, be, determined, because, of, the, lack, of, accurate, contemporaneous, sources, for, instance, the, monks, writing, the, annals, of, fulda, in, the, 9th, century, obviously, had, limited, knowledge, of, the, geography, of, distant, regions, of, central, europe, furthermore, moravian, monarchs, adopted, an, expansionist, policy, in, the, 830s, thus, the, borders, of, their, realm, often, changed, moravia, reached, the, peak, of, its, territorial, expansion, under, svatopluk, i, r, 870, 894, lesser, poland, pannonia, and, other, regions, were, forced, to, accept, at, least, formally, and, often, only, for, a, short, period, his, suzerainty, on, the, other, hand, the, existence, of, the, archaeologically, attested, shared, cultural, zones, between, moravia, lesser, poland, and, silesia, do, not, prove, that, the, northern, boundaries, of, moravia, were, located, over, these, territories, according, to, archaeologist, b, la, mikl, s, sz, ke, the, comitatus, of, mosaburg, in, pannonia, was, never, part, of, moravia, neither, archaeological, finds, nor, written, sources, substantiate, the, traditional, view, of, the, permanent, annexation, of, huge, territories, in, his, reign, other, scholars, warn, that, it, s, a, mistake, to, draw, the, boundaries, of, core, territories, because, moravia, did, not, reach, that, development, level, in, 1784, slovak, historian, juraj, sklen, r, disputed, the, traditional, view, on, the, location, of, moravia, and, placed, its, core, region, in, the, region, of, syrmia, stating, that, it, spread, from, that, location, to, the, north, to, present, day, slovakia, moravia, and, bohemia, similarly, in, the, 1820s, friedrich, blumenerger, placed, great, moravia, to, the, south, on, the, borders, of, pannonia, and, moesia, their, views, remained, isolated, until, the, 1970s, when, imre, boba, again, published, a, theory, that, moravia, s, core, territory, must, have, been, located, around, sirmium, near, the, river, great, morava, p, ter, p, sp, ki, nagy, proposed, the, existence, of, two, moravias, a, great, moravia, at, the, southern, morava, river, in, present, day, serbia, and, another, moravia, on, the, northern, morava, river, in, present, day, czech, republic, and, slovakia, a, similar, theory, was, also, published, by, toru, senga, in, the, 1990s, the, southern, thesis, was, further, developed, by, charles, bowlus, who, wrote, that, moravia, emerged, in, the, region, of, the, confluences, of, the, drava, sava, drina, tisza, and, southern, morava, rivers, with, the, danube, bowlus, emphasized, that, the, orientation, of, the, frankish, marcher, organization, was, focused, on, the, south, east, territories, which, also, supports, great, moravia, s, southern, position, martin, eggers, suggested, the, original, location, of, moravia, was, centered, around, modern, banat, at, the, confluence, of, the, rivers, tisza, and, mure, mori, in, serbian, with, further, expansions, extending, to, the, territories, in, present, day, czech, republic, and, slovakia, the, earliest, possible, reference, to, slavic, tribes, living, in, the, valley, of, the, northern, morava, river, was, made, by, the, byzantine, historian, procopius, he, wrote, of, a, group, of, germanic, heruli, who, passed, through, the, territory, of, all, of, the, sclavenes, while, moving, towards, denmark, in, 512, archaeological, sites, have, yielded, hand, made, ceramics, and, closely, analogous, objects, in, southern, poland, and, western, ukraine, appeared, at, the, confluence, of, the, northern, morava, river, and, the, middle, danube, dated, to, around, 550, large, territories, in, the, pannonian, basin, were, conquered, after, 568, by, the, nomadic, avars, who, had, arrived, from, the, eurasian, steppes, the, slavs, were, forced, to, pay, tribute, to, the, avars, and, to, participate, in, their, raids, against, the, byzantine, empire, the, franks, and, the, lombards, even, though, the, avar, settlement, area, stabilized, on, the, danube, river, in, the, early, period, of, the, khaganate, southern, border, of, present, day, slovakia, a, smaller, southernmost, part, came, under, their, direct, military, control, after, the, fall, of, samo, s, empire, in, the, late, period, of, the, khaganate, the, avars, had, already, inclined, to, a, more, settled, lifestyle, and, their, co, existence, with, the, local, slavs, can, be, already, characterized, as, some, kind, of, cultural, symbiosis, in, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, the, development, of, the, local, slavs, accelerated, the, first, slavic, fortified, settlements, were, built, in, present, day, moravia, as, early, as, the, last, decades, of, the, 7th, century, from, the, end, of, the, 7th, century, it, is, possible, to, register, the, rise, of, a, new, social, elite, in, moravia, slovakia, and, bohemia, the, warrior, horsemen, the, social, organization, of, the, local, slavs, continued, to, grow, during, the, 8th, century, which, can, be, documented, by, further, building, and, development, of, fortified, settlements, in, moravia, they, unambiguously, concentrate, around, the, river, morava, in, slovakia, the, oldest, slavic, fortified, settlements, are, documented, for, the, last, decades, of, the, 8th, century, they, were, exclusively, in, areas, which, were, not, under, direct, avar, influence, but, probably, not, built, only, as, protection, against, them, because, some, of, them, are, also, found, in, northern, territories, orava, spi, variation, in, pottery, implies, the, existence, of, at, least, three, tribes, inhabiting, the, wider, region, of, the, northern, morava, river, in, the, early, 9th, century, settlement, complexes, from, the, period, were, unearthed, for, instance, near, modern, bratislava, brno, and, olomouc, fortresses, erected, at, bratislava, rajhrad, star, m, sto, and, other, places, around, 800, evidence, the, development, of, local, centres, of, power, in, the, same, regions, charlemagne, launched, a, series, of, military, expeditions, against, the, avars, in, the, last, decade, of, the, 8th, century, which, caused, the, collapse, of, the, avar, khaganate, the, royal, frankish, annals, narrates, that, avars, who, could, not, stay, in, their, previous, dwelling, places, on, account, of, the, attacks, of, the, slavs, approached, charlemagne, in, aachen, in, 805, and, asked, to, be, allowed, to, settle, in, the, lowlands, along, the, river, r, ba, following, the, collapse, of, the, avar, khaganate, swords, and, other, elements, of, frankish, military, equipment, became, popular, in, territories, to, the, north, of, the, middle, danube, a, new, archaeological, horizon, the, so, called, blatnica, mikul, ice, horizon, emerged, in, the, valley, of, the, northern, morava, river, and, its, wider, region, in, the, same, period, this, horizon, of, metalwork, represents, a, synthesis, of, late, avar, and, carolingian, art, one, of, its, signature, items, is, a, sword, found, in, a, grave, in, blatnica, in, slovakia, which, is, dated, to, the, period, between, 825, and, 850, according, to, the, archaeologist, florin, curta, the, sword, was, produced, by, a, frankish, artisan, from, the, carolingian, empire, on, the, other, hand, j, n, dekan, writes, that, it, represents, how, moravian, craftsmen, selected, elements, from, the, ornamental, content, of, carolingian, art, which, suited, their, aesthetic, needs, and, traditions, moravia, the, first, western, slavic, polity, arose, through, the, unification, of, the, slavic, tribes, settled, north, of, the, danube, however, its, formation, is, scarcely, described, by, contemporaneous, sources, the, archaeologist, barford, writes, that, the, first, report, of, the, emerging, moravian, state, was, recorded, in, 811, in, the, autumn, of, this, year, according, to, the, royal, frankish, annals, avar, rulers, and, the, duces, or, leaders, of, the, slavs, who, live, along, the, danube, visited, the, court, of, emperor, louis, the, pious, r, 814, 840, in, aachen, the, earliest, certain, reference, to, moravians, or, maravani, is, dated, to, 822, when, the, emperor, received, embassies, and, presents, from, all, the, east, slavs, that, is, obodrites, sorbs, wilzi, bohemians, moravians, and, praedenecenti, and, from, the, avars, living, in, pannonia, at, an, assembly, held, at, frankfurt, the, late, 9th, century, conversio, bagoariorum, et, carantanorum, the, conversion, of, the, bavarians, and, the, carantanians, makes, the, first, reference, to, a, moravian, ruler, carantanians, ancestors, of, present, day, slovenians, were, the, first, slavic, people, to, accept, christianity, from, the, west, they, were, mostly, christianized, by, irish, missionaries, sent, by, the, archdiocese, of, salzburg, among, them, modestus, known, as, the, apostle, of, carantanians, this, process, was, later, described, in, the, conversio, bagoariorum, et, carantanorum, which, states, that, mojm, r, duke, of, the, moravians, expelled, one, pribina, across, the, danube, pribina, fled, to, ratpot, who, administered, the, march, of, pannonia, from, around, 833, whether, pribina, had, up, to, that, time, been, an, independent, ruler, or, one, of, mojmir, s, officials, is, a, matter, of, scholarly, discussion, for, instance, urba, czyk, writes, that, mojmir, and, pribina, were, two, of, the, many, moravian, princes, in, the, early, 9th, century, while, according, to, havl, k, t, e, t, k, and, vlasto, pribina, was, mojm, r, s, lieutenant, in, nitra, historians, who, identify, pribina, as, the, ruler, of, an, autonomous, state, the, principality, of, nitra, for, instance, bartl, kirschbaum, and, urba, czyk, add, that, great, moravia, emerged, through, the, enforced, integration, of, his, principality, into, moravia, under, mojm, r, the, 9th, century, catalogue, of, fortresses, and, regions, to, the, north, of, the, danube, which, lists, the, peoples, along, the, borders, of, east, francia, in, a, north, to, south, order, mentions, that, the, moravians, or, marharii, had, 11, fortresses, or, civitates, the, document, locates, the, marhari, between, the, bohemians, and, the, bulgars, and, also, makes, mention, of, the, merehani, and, their, 30, fortresses, according, to, havl, k, who, writes, that, conversion, is, a, consolidated, version, of, notes, made, by, several, authors, in, different, years, the, moravians, are, twice, mentioned, in, the, text, first, as, marhari, and, next, as, merehani, he, says, that, the, reference, to, the, marhari, and, their, 11, fortresses, was, made, between, 817, and, 843, and, the, note, of, the, merehani, shows, the, actual, state, under, svatopluk, i, in, contrast, with, havl, k, steinh, bel, together, with, t, e, t, k, and, vlasto, identify, the, merehani, with, the, inhabitants, of, the, principality, of, nitra, a, third, view, is, presented, by, p, sp, ki, nagy, and, senga, who, write, that, the, reference, to, the, merehanii, who, obviously, inhabited, the, southern, regions, of, the, great, hungarian, plains, to, the, north, of, the, danube, but, south, of, the, territories, dominated, by, the, bulgars, and, their, 30, fortresses, shows, the, existence, of, another, moravia, in, central, europe, among, the, bohemians, are, 15, fortresses, the, have, 11, fortresses, the, region, of, the, bulgars, is, immense, that, numerous, people, has, five, fortresses, since, their, great, multitude, does, not, require, fortresses, the, people, called, have, 30, fortresses, according, to, a, 13th, century, source, the, history, of, the, bishops, of, passau, and, the, dukes, of, bavaria, bishop, reginhar, of, passau, r, 818, 838, baptized, all, of, the, moravians, in, 831, there, is, no, other, information, on, the, circumstances, of, this, mass, conversion, vlasto, writes, that, mojm, r, had, by, that, time, been, converted, to, christianity, according, to, petr, sommer, and, other, historians, he, was, also, baptized, on, this, occasion, all, the, same, the, life, of, methodius, narrates, that, christian, missionaries, had, by, the, 860s, arrived, in, moravia, from, among, the, italians, greeks, and, germans, who, taught, them, in, various, ways, the, life, of, constantine, adds, that, missionaries, from, east, francia, did, not, forbid, the, offering, of, sacrifices, according, to, the, ancient, customs, which, shows, that, pagan, rites, were, continued, for, decades, even, after, 831, according, to, the, annals, of, fulda, around, august, 15, 846, louis, the, german, king, of, east, francia, r, 843, 876, launched, a, campaign, against, the, moravian, slavs, who, were, planning, to, defect, the, exact, circumstances, of, his, expedition, are, unclear, for, instance, vlasto, writes, that, the, frankish, monarch, took, advantage, of, the, internal, strife, which, followed, mojm, r, s, death, while, according, to, kirschbaum, mojm, r, was, captured, and, dethroned, during, the, campaign, however, it, is, without, doubt, that, louis, the, german, appointed, mojm, r, s, nephew, rastislav, as, the, new, duke, of, moravia, during, this, campaign, rastislav, r, 846, 870, who, initially, accepted, the, suzerainty, of, louis, the, german, consolidated, his, position, within, moravia, and, expanded, the, frontiers, of, his, realm, for, instance, according, to, kirschbaum, he, annexed, the, region, of, the, slansk, hills, in, the, eastern, parts, of, present, day, slovakia, barford, even, writes, that, the, development, of, the, state, mentioned, as, great, moravia, by, constantine, porphyrogenitus, commenced, in, rastislav, s, reign, he, turned, against, east, francia, and, supported, the, rebellion, of, radbod, the, deposed, prefect, of, the, march, of, pannonia, against, louis, the, german, in, 853, the, frankish,

them, though, the, combats, lasted, until, a, peace, treaty, was, worked, out, in, 859, the, truce, is, regarded, as, a, stalemate, and, shows, the, growing, strength, of, rastislav, s, realm, conflicts, between, moravia, and, east, francia, continued, for, years, for, instance, rastislav, supported, louis, the, german, s, son, carloman, in, his, rebellion, against, his, father, in, 861, the, first, record, of, a, raid, by, the, magyars, in, central, europe, seems, to, have, been, connected, to, these, events, according, to, the, annals, of, st, bertin, enemies, called, hungarians, ravaged, louis, the, german, s, kingdom, in, 862, which, suggests, that, they, supported, carloman, rastislav, wanted, to, weaken, influence, of, frankish, priests, in, his, realm, who, served, the, interests, of, east, francia, he, first, sent, envoys, to, pope, nicholas, i, in, 861, and, asked, him, to, send, missionaries, to, moravia, who, mastered, the, slavic, language, having, received, no, answer, from, rome, rastislav, turned, to, the, byzantine, emperor, michael, iii, with, the, same, request, by, establishing, relations, with, constantinople, he, also, desired, to, counter, an, anti, moravian, alliance, recently, concluded, between, the, franks, and, bulgarians, upon, his, request, the, emperor, sent, two, brothers, constantine, and, methodius, the, future, saints, cyril, and,

certain, city, which, in, the, language, of, that, people, is, called, dowina, according, to, the, annals, of, fulda, although, the, franks, could, not, take, the, fortress, rastislav, agreed, to, accept, louis, the, german, s, suzerainty, however, he, continued, to, support, the, frankish, monarch, s, opponents, for, instance, louis, the, german, deprived, one, count, werner, of, his, public, offices, because, the, count, was, suspected, to, have, conspired, with, rastislav, against, the, king, the, byzantine, brothers, constantine, cyril, and, methodius, visited, rome, in, 867, at, the,

869, in, 869, methodius, was, sent, by, the, pope, to, rastislav, svatopluk, and, kocel, but, methodius, visited, only, kocel, who, sent, him, back, to, the, pope, hadrian, then, consecrated,

svatopluk, s, realms, in, august, 869, according, to, the, annals, of, fulda, the, franks, destroyed, many, forts, defeated, moravian, troops, and, seized, loot, however, they, could, not, take,

returned, to, moravia, methodius, s, life, narrates, that, prince, svatopluk, and, all, the, moravians, decided, to, entrust, to, him, all, the, churches, and, clergy, in, all, the, towns, in, moravia, upon, his, arrival, in, moravia, methodius, continued, the, work, of, translation, started, in, his, brother, s, life, for, instance, he, translated, all, the, scriptures, in, full, save, maccabees, according, to, his, life, however, frankish, priests, in, moravia, opposed, the, slavic, liturgy, and, even, accused, methodius, of, heresy, although, the, holy, see, never, denied, methodius, s, orthodoxy, in, 880, the, pope, appointed, his, main, opponent, wiching, as, bishop, of, nitra, upon, the, request, of, svatopluk, who, himself, preferred, the, latin, rite, a, letter, written, around, 900, by, archbishop, theotmar, of, salzburg, r, 873, 907, and, his, suffragan, bishops, mentions, that, the, pope, sent, wiching, to, a, newly, baptized, people, whom, svatopluk, had, defeated, in, war, and, converted, from, paganism, to, christianity, other, sources, also, prove, that, svatopluk, significantly, expanded, the, borders, of, his, realm, for, instance, according, to, the, life, of, methodius, moravia, began, to, expand, much, more, into, all, lands, and, to, defeat, its, enemies, successfully, in, the, period, beginning, around, 874, the, same, source, writes, of, a, very, powerful, pagan, prince, settled, on, the, vistula, in, present, day, poland, who, persecuted, the, christians, in, his, country, but, was, attacked, and, seized, by, svatopluk, upon, methodius, s, request, in, june, 880, pope, john, issued, the, bull, industriae, tuae, for, svatopluk, whom, he, addressed, as, glorious, count, gloriosus, comes, in, the, bull, the, pope, refers, to, svatopluk, as, the, only, son, unicus, fillius, of, the, holy, see, thus, applying, a, title, which, had, up, to, that, time, been, only, used, in, papal, correspondence, with, emperors, and, candidates, for, imperial, rank, the, pope, explicitly, granted, the, protection, of, the, holy, see, to, the, moravian, monarch, his, officials, and, subjects, furthermore, the, bull, also, confirmed, methodius, s, position, as, the, head, of, the, church, in, moravia, with, jurisdiction, over, all, clergymen, including, the, frankish, priests, in, svatopluk, s, realm, and, old, church, slavonic, was, recognized, as, the, fourth, liturgical, language, together, with, latin, greek, and, hebrew, the, longer, version, of, the, annals, of, salzburg, makes, mention, of, a, raid, by, the, magyars, and, the, kabars, in, east, francia, in, 881, according, to, gyula, krist, and, other, historians, svatopluk, initiated, this, raid, because, his, relations, with, arnulf, the, son, of, carloman, king, of, east, francia, r, 876, 881, who, administered, the, march, of, pannonia, became, tense, archbishop, theotmar, of, salzburg, clearly, accused, the, moravians, of, hiring, a, large, number, of, hungarians, and, sending, them, against, east, francia, at, an, unspecified, date, during, the, wilhelminer, war, a, civil, war, between, two, factions, of, local, noblemen, in, the, march, of, pannonia, which, lasted, from, 882, and, 884, svatopluk, collected, troops, from, all, the, slav, lands, and, invaded, pannonia, according, to, the, bavarian, version, of, the, annals, of, fulda, the, moravians, invasion, led, to, pannonia, s, being, laid, waste, to, the, east, of, the, river, r, ba, however, regino, of, pr, m, states, that, it, was, arnulf, of, carinthia, who, maintained, control, over, pannonia, in, 884, svatopluk, had, a, meeting, with, emperor, charles, the, fat, r, 881, 888, at, tulln, an, der, donau, in, bavaria, in, 884, at, the, meeting, dux, svatopluk, became, the, emperor, s, vassal, and, swore, fidelity, to, him, promising, that, he, would, never, attack, the, emperor, s, realm, archbishop, methodius, died, on, april, 6, 885, led, by, bishop, wiching, of, nitra, methodius, s, opponents, took, advantage, of, his, death, and, persuaded, pope, stephen, v, r, 885, 891, to, restrict, the, use, of, old, church, slavonic, in, the, liturgy, in, the, bull, quia, te, zelo, bishop, wiching, even, convinced, svatopluk, to, expel, all, methodius, s, disciples, from, moravia, in, 886, thus, marring, the, promising, literary, and, cultural, boom, of, central, european, slavs, the, slovaks, took, nearly, a, thousand, years, to, develop, a, new, literary, language, of, their, own, pope, stephen, addressed, the, quia, te, zelo, bull, to, zventopolco, regi, sclavorum, svatopluk, king, of, the, slavs, suggesting, that, svatopluk, had, by, the, end, of, 885, been, crowned, king, likewise, frankish, annals, occasionally, referred, to, svatopluk, as, king, in, connection, with, events, occurring, in, this, period, the, chronicle, of, the, priest, of, dioclea, a, late, 12th, century, source, with, questionable, reliability, narrates, that, one, sventopelk, was, crowned, king, on, the, field, of, dalma, in, the, presence, of, a, papal, legate, moravia, reached, its, maximum, territorial, extent, in, the, last, years, of, svatopluk, s, reign, according, to, regino, of, pr, m, king, arnulf, of, east, francia, gave, the, command, of, the, bohemians, to, king, zwentibald, of, the, moravian, slavs, in, 890, bartl, and, other, slovak, historians, write, that, svatopluk, probably, also, annexed, silesia, and, lusatia, in, the, early, 890s, according, to, the, annals, of, fulda, king, arnulf, proposed, a, meeting, to, svatopluk, in, 892, but, the, latter, in, his, usual, fashion, refused, to, come, to, the, king, and, betrayed, his, fidelity, and, all, the, things, which, he, had, promised, before, in, response, arnulf, invaded, moravia, in, 892, but, could, not, defeat, svatopluk, although, magyar, horsemen, also, supported, the, eastern, frankish, monarch, svatopluk, a, man, most, prudent, among, his, people, and, very, cunning, by, nature, according, to, regino, of, pr, m, died, in, the, summer, of, 894, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, mojmir, ii, but, his, empire, shortly, disintegrated, because, the, tribes, subjugated, to, svatopluk, s, rule, by, force, started, to, get, rid, of, moravian, supremacy, for, instance, the, bohemian, dukes, based, in, the, prague, region, accepted, king, arnulf, s, suzerainty, in, june, 895, and, mojm, r, ii, attempted, to, restore, his, supremacy, over, them, without, success, in, the, next, two, years, on, the, other, hand, he, succeeded, in, restoring, the, church, organization, in, moravia, by, persuading, pope, john, ix, r, 898, 900, to, send, his, legates, to, moravia, in, 898, the, legates, in, short, order, installed, an, archbishop, and, three, bishops, as, his, suffragans, in, moravia, conflicts, emerging, between, mojm, r, ii, and, his, younger, brother, svatopluk, ii, gave, king, arnulf, a, pretext, to, send, his, troops, to, moravia, in, 898, and, 899, the, annals, of, fulda, writes, that, the, boy, svatopluk, ii, was, rescued, by, bavarian, forces, from, the, dungeon, of, the, city, in, which, he, was, held, with, his, men, in, 899, according, to, bartl, who, wrote, that, svatopluk, ii, had, inherited, the, principality, of, nitra, from, his, father, the, bavarians, also, destroyed, the, fortress, at, nitra, on, this, occasion, according, to, most, nearly, contemporaneous, sources, the, hungarians, played, a, prominent, role, in, the, fall, of, moravia, for, instance, regino, of, pr, m, writes, that, svatopluk, i, s, sons, held, his, kingdom, for, a, short, and, unhappy, time, because, the, hungarians, utterly, destroyed, everything, in, it, the, hungarians, started, their, conquest, of, the, carpathian, basin, after, their, defeat, in, the, westernmost, territories, of, the, pontic, steppes, around, 895, by, a, coalition, of, the, bulgars, and, pechenegs, only, a, late, source, the, 16th, century, johannes, aventinus, writes, that, the, hungarians, had, by, that, time, controlled, wide, regions, to, east, of, the, rivers, hron, and, danube, in, the, carpathian, basin, a, letter, of, theotmar, of, salzburg, and, his, suffragans, evidences, that, around, 900, the, moravians, and, the, bavarians, accused, each, other, of, having, formed, alliances, even, by, taking, oaths, by, the, means, of, a, dog, and, a, wolf, and, through, other, abominable, and, pagan, customs, with, the, hungarians, according, to, liudprand, of, cremona, the, hungarians, already, claimed, for, themselves, the, nation, of, the, moravians, which, king, arnulf, had, subdued, with, the, aid, of, their, might, at, the, coronation, of, arnulf, s, son, louis, the, child, in, 900, the, annals, of, grado, adds, that, a, large, hungarian, army, attacked, and, invaded, the, moravians, in, 900, facing, the, threat, of, further, hungarian, attacks, mojm, r, ii, concluded, a, peace, treaty, with, louis, the, child, in, 901, due, to, the, lack, of, documentary, evidence, the, year, in, which, moravia, ceased, to, exist, cannot, be, determined, with, certainty, r, na, tas, writes, that, the, hungarians, occupied, moravia, in, 902, victor, spinei, says, that, this, happened, in, 903, or, 904, while, according, to, spiesz, the, moravian, state, ceased, to, exist, in, 907, the, raffelstetten, customs, regulations, which, was, issued, in, the, years, 903, 906, still, refers, to, the, markets, of, the, moravians, suggesting, that, moravia, still, existed, at, that, time, it, is, without, doubt, that, no, moravian, forces, fought, in, the, battle, at, brezalauspurc, where, the, hungarians, routed, a, large, bavarian, force, in, 907, the, moravian, land, according, to, the, prophecy, of, the, holy, archbishop, methodius, was, promptly, punished, by, god, for, their, lawlessness, and, heresy, for, the, banishment, of, the, orthodox, fathers, and, for, the, torments, inflicted, on, the, latter, by, the, heretics, with, whom, they, acquiesced, in, a, few, years, the, magyars, came, a, people, of, peonia, sacked, their, land, and, devastated, it, but, were, not, captured, by, the, magyars, for, they, fled, to, the, bulgarians, however, the, land, remained, desolate, under, the, rule, of, the, magyars, written, sources, from, the, 9th, century, contain, almost, no, information, on, the, internal, affairs, of, moravia, only, two, legal, texts, the, nomocanon, and, the, court, law, for, the, people, have, been, preserved, the, former, is, a, translation, of, a, collection, of, byzantine, ecclesiastical, law, the, latter, is, based, on, the, 8th, century, byzantine, law, code, known, as, ecloga, both, were, completed, by, methodius, shortly, before, his, death, in, 885, in, addition, to, the, study, of, early, medieval, chronicles, and, charters, archaeological, research, contributed, to, the, understanding, of, the, moravian, state, and, society, the, moravian, centres, at, mikul, ice, pohansko, and, star, m, sto, were, thoroughly, excavated, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, however, as, mach, ek, writes, the, acquired, huge, amounts, of, finds, and, data, still, have, to, be, properly, processed, the, nuclei, of, the, great, moravian, settlement, structure, were, well, defended, fortified, settlements, built, by, the, local, slavs, both, on, elevated, positions, and, lowland, areas, like, marshes, and, river, islands, most, great, moravian, castles, were, rather, large, hill, forts, fortified, by, wooden, palisades, stone, walls, and, in, some, cases, moats, the, typical, great, moravian, ramparts, combined, an, outer, drystone, wall, with, an, internal, timber, structure, filled, with, earth, the, fortifications, usually, formed, several, contiguous, enclosures, with, the, elite, buildings, concentrated, in, the, centre, and, crafts, in, the, outer, enclosures, most, buildings, were, made, of, timber, but, ecclesiastical, buildings, and, residential, dwellings, were, made, of, stone, in, many, cases, prehistoric, fortifications, were, also, integrated, the, great, moravian, towns, especially, in, moravia, but, also, in, the, lowlands, of, slovakia, were, frequently, far, from, the, place, where, the, stone, was, mined, and, material, was, transported, dozens, of, kilometres, the, great, moravian, settlements, can, be, divided, into, four, main, categories, the, most, important, were, localities, with, central, functions, like, mikul, ice, valy, star, m, sto, uhersk, hradi, t, and, nitra, where, several, castles, and, settlements, formed, a, huge, fortified, pre, urban, agglomeration, along, with, the, main, centres, the, system, of, fortified, settlements, included, fortified, regional, administrative, hubs, forts, whose, primary, function, was, defence, and, refuge, forts, which, were, not, inhabited, permanently, but, were, used, in, the, case, of, danger, the, largest, forts, were, usually, protected, by, a, chain, of, smaller, forts, smaller, forts, were, also, built, to, protect, trade, routes, and, to, provide, shelter, for, peasants, in, case, of, attack, the, existence, of, noble, courts, like, in, ducov, and, in, other, places, is, also, documented, their, form, was, probably, inspired, by, carolingian, estates, called, curtis, in, 9th, century, mikul, ice, the, central, fortified, area, or, acropolis, was, set, on, an, island, in, the, morava, and, surrounded, by, a, stone, faced, rampart, that, enclosed, an, area, of, six, hectares, extensive, extramural, settlement, of, 200, hectares, stood, unfortified, although, the, location, of, the, great, moravian, capital, veligrad, has, not, been, identified, mikul, ice, with, its, palace, and, 12, churches, is, the, most, widely, accepted, candidate, an, important, settlement, was, a, large, agglomeration, in, pohansko, near, b, eclav, nitra, the, centre, of, the, eastern,

from, father, to, son, actually, svatopluk, i, was, the, only, ruler, who, was, succeeded, by, his, son, rastislav, ascended, the, throne, through, the, east, frankish, monarch, s, intervention, and, slavomir, was, elected, as, duke, when, the, franks, captured, svatopluk, in, 871, the, latter, case, reveals, the, strong, claim, of, the, mojmir, dynasty, to, the, throne, because, slavomir, was, an, ordained, priest, at, the, time, of, his, election, the, moravian, monarchs, were, regularly, styled, as, ducis, dukes, occasionally, as, regis, kings, or, maliks, kings, in, 9th, century, documents, tombs, within, a, church, have, only, been, discovered, at, mikul, ice, implying, that, royals, had, an, exclusive, right, to, be, buried, in, such, a, prestigious, place, the, annals, of, fulda, never, refers, to, the, moravian, monarchs, as, rulers, of, a, state, but, as, heads, of, a, people, dux, maravorum, duke, of, the, moravians, accordingly, mach, ek, writes, that, great, moravia, was, not, primarily, organized, on, a, territorial, basis, but, more, likely, on, the, foundation, of, real, or, fictitious, kinship, bonds, within, the, tribal, structure, on, the, other, hand, havl, k, says, that, moravia, was, divided, into, counties, each, headed, by, rich, honourable, and, well, born, noblemen, whom, he, styles, as, zhupans, he, even, adds, that, the, number, of, counties, increased, from, 11, to, 30, by, the, second, half, of, the, 9th, century, tefan, adds, that, the, existence, of, scattered, groups, of, farmer, warriors, which, is, suggested, by, archaeological, research, implies, the, existence, of, administrative, territorial, units, because, without, such, a, system, the, monarchs, could, not, organize, their, campaigns, svatopluk, incorporated, a, number, of, slavic, tribes, including, the, bohemians, and, vistulans, into, his, empire, the, subjugated, tribes, were, administered, by, vassal, princes, or, governors, but, they, preserved, their, autonomy, which, contributed, to, the, quick, disintegration, of, svatopluk, s, moravia, after, his, death, according, to, bartl, kirschbaum, tefan, and, other, historians, great, moravia, had, two, centres, according, to, havl, k, the, terms, moravian, lands, morav, skskyj, strany, upper, moravias, vy, n, nii, morav, vy, n, nej, moravy, and, moravian, realms, regna, marahensium, regna, marauorum, which, were, used, in, 9th, century, documents, refer, to, the, dualistic, organisation, of, the, moravian, state, consisting, of, the, realm, of, rastislav, regnum, rastizi, and, the, realm, of, svatopluk, regnum, zwentibaldi, he, and, other, historians, identify, the, former, with, modern, moravia, in, the, czech, republic, and, the, latter, with, the, principality, of, nitra, in, present, day, slovakia, however, this, view, is, not, universally, accepted, svatopluk, s, realm, has, also, been, identified, with, the, wider, region, of, star, m, sto, or, with, the, lands, between, the, danube, and, the, tisza, or, east, of, the, tisza, the, known, sources, contain, records, about, 65, events, related, to, warfare, and, great, moravia, the, most, detailed, are, the, frankish, sources, during, svatopluk, s, reign, the, structure, of, the, great, moravian, army, was, based, mainly, on, an, early, feudal, conception, of, military, service, performed, primarily, by, the, ruling, elites, the, core, of, the, great, moravian, army, was, a, princely, retinue, comprising, professional, warriors, who, were, responsible, for, collecting, tribute, and, punishing, wrongdoers, dru, ina, the, dru, ina, consisted, of, members, of, the, aristocracy, older, retinue, and, members, of, the, princely, military, groups, younger, retinue, some, of, its, members, formed, a, permanent, armed, guard, for, the, prince, while, the, rest, were, garrisoned, at, forts, or, at, other, strategic, points, the, dru, ina, was, probably, relatively, loyal, and, provided, stable, support, for, the, prince, since, there, is, no, known, record, of, any, dissatisfaction, with, it, or, of, any, uprising, the, permanent, part, of, the, army, had, an, expressly, cavalry, character, the, great, moravian, heavy, cavalry, emulated, the, contemporary, frankish, predecessors, of, knights, with, the, expensive, equipment, that, only, the, highest, social, strata, could, afford, a, contemporary, arab, traveller, ahmad, ibn, fadlan, reported, that, svatopluk, i, had, plenty, of, cavalry, horses, the, overall, size, of, the, dru, ina, is, estimated, by, ruttkay, at, 3, 000, 5, 000, men, in, the, case, of, larger, mobilisations, cavalry, was, reinforced, by, additional, smaller, units, recruited, from, the, retinues, of, local, magnates, and, from, traditional, communities, ob, ina, the, second, element, of, the, army, pohotovos, consisted, of, lower, classes, of, free, citizens, who, were, not, in, most, cases, professional, warriors, however, thanks, to, their, large, numbers, and, knowledge, of, the, prevalent, types, of, weapons, they, represented, a, serious, military, force, they, played, a, decisive, role, mainly, in, the, defence, of, great, moravian, territory, their, participation, in, wars, of, expansion, was, less, common, the, army, was, led, by, the, prince, or, in, his, absence, by, a, commander, in, chief, called, a, voivode, the, maximum, size, of, the, army, is, estimated, at, 20, 000, 30, 000, men, in, case, of, external, aggression, ordinary, people, participated, in, defence, and, diversion, actions, an, important, element, of, the, defence, of, great, moravia, was, a, system, of, strong, fortifications, which, were, difficult, to, besiege, with, the, then, prevailing, forms, of, military, organization, for, example, a, frankish, chronicler, wrote, with, awe, about, the, size, of, rastislav, s, fortress, firmissimum, ut, feritur, vallum, the, typical, weapon, of, a, west, slavic, foot, soldier, was, an, axe, of, a, specific, shape, called, a, bradatica, spears, were, universally, used, by, both, infantry, and, cavalry, the, weapons, associated, with, a, nomadic, avar, culture, like, sabres, reflexion, bows, and, specific, types, of, spears, are, missing, on, the, other, hand, a, military, equipment, became, more, influenced, by, western, types, and, new, types, of, weapons, like, double, edged, swords, rare, before, the, 9th, century, became, popular, archers, unlike, the, previous, period, were, already, a, part, of, the, infantry, the, existence, of, a, local, aristocracy, is, well, documented, contemporaneous, sources, refer, to, leading, men, optimates, or, primates, and, nobiles, viri, or, principes, however, these, documents, do, not, reveal, the, basis, of, the, moravian, chiefs, power, richly, furnished, graves, with, the, exception, of, the, one, at, blatnica, which, is, an, old, and, disputable, find, according, to, tefan, have, only, been, unearthed, in, mikul, ice, and, other, large, fortifications, controlled, by, the, monarchs, tefan, writes, that, the, concentration, of, prestige, goods, in, the, towns, shows, that, immediate, contact, with, the, sovereign, who, certainly, travelled, between, the, centres, was, apparently, the, best, winning, strategy, for, the, top, elite, on, the, other, hand, the, optimates, had, an, important, role, in, the, government, the, monarchs, did, not, make, important, decisions, without, discussing, them, in, a, council, formed, by, the, moravian, dukes, great, moravia, was, inhabited, by, the, west, slavic, subgroup, of, the, larger, slavic, ethno, linguistical, group, the, west, slavs, have, their, origin, in, early, slavic, tribes, which, settled, in, central, europe, after, east, germanic, tribes, had, largely, left, this, area, during, the, migration, period, while, the, west, slavs, assimilated, the, remaining, celtic, and, germanic, populations, in, the, area, moravians, had, strong, cultural, ties, to, their, western, neighbors, the, franks, with, certain, objects, proving, carolingian, influence, the, archaeological, evidence, demonstrates, that, the, 9th, century, material, culture, found, in, modern, moravia, was, very, much, in, the, frankish, sphere, and, showed, minor, byzantine, influence, carolingian, influence, affected, all, spheres, of, life, in, great, moravia, after, the, carolingian, empire, was, divided, the, ottonian, dynasty, took, over, and, continued, and, cultivated, carolingian, traditions, it, is, not, accidental, that, the, newly, created, medieval, west, slavonic, states, borrow, from, carolingian, tradition, via, the, ottonian, empire, most, of, the, population, was, formed, by, freemen, who, were, obliged, to, pay, an, annual, tax, slavery, and, feudal, dependency, are, also, recorded, the, analysis, of, early, medieval, cemeteries, in, moravia, shows, that, 40, percent, of, men, and, 60, percent, of, women, died, before, reaching, the, age, of, 40, more, than, 40, percent, of, the, graves, contained, the, remains, of, children, aged, one, to, twelve, however, the, cemeteries, also, document, rich, nutrition, and, advanced, health, care, for, instance, a, third, of, the, examined, skeletons, had, no, caries, or, lost, teeth, and, bone, fractures, healed, without, dislocation, the, large, 9th, century, fortresses, unearthed, at, mikul, ice, and, other, places, were, located, in, the, wider, region, of, the, confluence, of, the, rivers, morava, and, danube, two, important, trade, routes, crossed, this, region, in, this, period, the, danube, and, the, ancient, amber, road, implying, that, these, settlements, all, lying, on, rivers, were, important, centres, of, commerce, finds, of, tools, raw, materials, and, semi, manufactured, goods, show, that, quarters, inhabited, by, craftsmen, also, existed, in, these, settlements, the, large, fortresses, were, surrounded, by, a, number, of, small, villages, where, the, locals, were, engaged, in, agriculture, they, cultivated, wheat, barley, millet, and, other, cereals, and, farmed, cattle, pigs, sheep, and, horse, their, animals, were, relatively, small, for, instance, their, horses, were, not, larger, than, modern, przewalski, horses, the, existence, of, a, general, exchange, medium, in, moravia, has, not, been, proven, there, is, no, sign, of, local, coinage, and, foreign, coins, are, scarce, according, to, bialekov, and, other, archaeologists, the, axe, shaped, ingots, grivnas, unearthed, in, great, number, in, fortresses, served, as, premonetary, currencies, this, theory, has, not, universally, been, accepted, because, these, objects, have, also, been, interpreted, as, intermediate, products, intended, for, further, treatment, according, to, mach, ek, the, lack, of, coins, meant, that, moravian, monarchs, could, not, effectively, collect, taxes, customs, and, fines, which, weakened, their, international, position, iron, metallurgy, and, smithing, were, the, most, important, branches, of, local, industry, an, example, of, highly, developed, tool, production, are, asymmetrical, plowshares, there, is, no, sign, of, silver, gold, copper, or, lead, mines, in, moravia, but, jewellery, and, weapons, were, produced, locally, accordingly, their, prime, material, was, acquired, as, loot, or, gift, or, brought, to, moravia, by, merchants, archaeological, research, also, evidences, the, import, of, prestige, goods, including, silk, brocade, and, glass, vessels, according, to, tefan, and, mach, ek, the, moravians, primarily, provided, slaves, acquired, as, prisoners, of, war, during, their, raids, in, the, neighbouring, regions, in, exchange, for, these, luxury, goods, for, instance, archbishop, thietmar, of, salzburg, accused, the, moravians, of, bringing, noble, men, and, honest, women, into, slavery, during, their, campaigns, in, pannonia, slave, trading, is, also, well, documented, the, first, legend, of, naum, narrates, that, many, of, methodius, s, disciples, were, sold, for, money, to, the, jews, after, 885, and, the, raffelstetten, customs, regulations, makes, mention, of, slaves, delivered, from, moravia, to, the, west, the, views, on, great, moravian, sacral, architecture, changed, dramatically, during, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, at, first, researchers, assumed, it, to, be, limited, to, simple, wooden, churches, like, those, known, from, the, german, environment, in, dating, from, the, 7th, to, 8th, centuries, these, wooden, churches, were, suitable, for, initial, missionary, activities, due, to, the, easy, availability, of, materials, quick, construction, and, no, need, for, consecration, this, opinion, was, refined, in, 1949, after, excavations, in, star, m, sto, from, the, 1960s, stone, churches, have, also, been, excavated, in, slovakia, as, of, 2014, more, than, 25, sacral, buildings, have, been, safely, identified, in, the, core, territory, of, great, moravia, moravia, and, western, slovakia, the, remains, of, the, first, uncovered, churches, were, only, negatives, ditches, filled, with, secondary, material, after, removal, of, original, foundations, but, later, research, also, uncovered, remains, of, buildings, with, original, foundations, especially, after, the, discovery, of, great, moravian, graves, near, the, church, in, kop, any, the, potential, great, moravian, origin, of, several, still, standing, churches, in, slovakia, viz, kop, any, nitrianska, blatnica, kosto, any, pod, tribe, om, was, once, more, an, open, question, the, exact, dating, is, a, goal, of, ongoing, research, based, on, radiocarbon, analysis, and, dendrochronology, great, moravian, sacral, architecture, is, represented, by, a, rich, variety, of, types, from, three, nave, basilicas, mikul, ice, iii, bratislava, triconcha, dev, n, simple, rotunda, without, apses, mikul, ice, vii, two, apse, rotunda, mikul, ice, vi, tetraconchic, rotunda, mikul, ice, ix, and, a, whole, group, of, one, nave, churches, and, rotundas, with, one, apse, the, largest, number, of, churches, has, been, found, in, south, eastern, moravia, mikul, ice, with, twelve, churches, clearly, dominates, among, all, other, localities, with, the, first, stone, churches, built, around, 800, a, potential, thirteenth, church, is, kop, any, on, the, slovak, side, of, the, border, the, three, nave, basilica, from, mikul, ice, which, has, interior, dimensions, of, 35, m, by, 9, m, and, a, separate, baptistery, is, the, largest, sacral, building, found, to, date, the, high, concentration, of, churches, in, mikulul, ice, exceeded, the, needs, of, the, local, population, and, so, are, believed, to, be, proprietary, churches, eigenkirchen, known, also, in, francia, large, churches, were, also, important, ecclesiastical, centres, the, current, dating, of, several, churches, precedes, the, byzantine, mission, the, churches, were, decorated, mostly, by, frescoes, but, usage, of, secco, is, also, documented, the, authors, were, probably, foreign, artists, from, francia, and, northern, italy, the, latter, indicated, by, for, example, the, chemical, composition, of, paintings, in, bratislava, and, dev, n, great, moravian, sacral, architecture, was, probably, influenced, by, frankish, dalmatian, istrian, byzantine, and, classical, architecture, which, also, indicated, complex, missionary, activities, two, open, air, museums, in, modr, near, uhersk, hradi, t, and, in, ducov, are, devoted, to, great, moravian, architecture, like, other, slavs, the, great, moravian, slavs, originally, practised, a, polytheistic, religion, with, an, ancestor, cult, several, cult, places, used, prior, to, the, christianization, of, moravia, have, been, found, in, moravia, mikul, ice, and, pohansko, however, we, do, not, know, what, these, objects, such, as, a, ring, ditch, with, a, fire, a, horse, sacrifice, or, human, limbs, ritually, buried, in, a, cemetery, meant, to, great, moravians, an, alleged, cult, object, in, mikul, ice, was, reportedly, used, until, the, evangelization, of, the, moravian, elite, in, the, mid, 9th, century, and, idols, in, pohansko, were, raised, on, the, site, of, a, demolished, church, during, the, pagan, backlash, in, the, 10th, century, the, only, slavic, pagan, shrine, found, in, modern, slovakia, is, an, object, in, most, pri, bratislave, dedicated, probably, to, the, god, of, war, and, thunder, perun, the, shrine, was, abandoned, in, the, mid, 9th, century, and, never, restored, the, spread, of, christianity, had, several, stages, and, it, is, still, an, open, research, question, in, older, publications, the, first, organized, missions, were, attributed, mainly, to, hiberno, scottish, missionaries, but, modern, works, are, more, sceptical, about, their, direct, influence, the, territory, of, great, moravia, was, originally, evangelized, by, missionaries, coming, from, the, frankish, empire, or, byzantine, enclaves, in, italy, and, dalmatia, from, the, early, 8th, century, and, sporadically, earlier, traces, of, an, aquileia, dalmatic, mission, are, found, in, great, moravian, architecture, and, language, northern, italian, influence, is, assumed, also, for, golden, plaques, with, christian, motifs, from, bojn, probably, from, a, portable, altar, which, belong, to, the, most, important, christian, artefacts, dated, prior, to, the, mission, of, saints, cyril, and, methodius, especially, after, the, defeat, of, the, avars, at, the, end, of, the, 8th, century, frankish, missionaries, became, the, most, important, part, of, organized, missions, the, first, christian, church, of, the, western, and, eastern, slavs, known, from, written, sources, was, built, in, 828, by, pribina, in, nitra, and, consecrated, by, bishop, adalram, of, salzburg, most, of, the, territory, was, christianized, until, the, mid, 9th, century, despite, the, formal, endorsement, by, the, elites, great, moravian, christianity, was, described, as, containing, many, pagan, elements, as, late, as, 852, grave, goods, such, as, food, could, be, found, even, in, church, graveyards, the, church, organization, in, great, moravia, was, supervised, by, the, bavarian, clergy, until, the, arrival, of, the, byzantine, missionaries, saints, cyril, and, methodius, in, 863, in, 880, the, pope, ordained, a, swabian, monk, wiching, as, bishop, of, the, newly, established, see, of, nitra, sancta, ecclesia, nitriensis, some, experts, e, g, sz, ke, b, la, mikl, s, say, that, the, location, of, the, seat, of, 9th, century, diocese, is, different, from, present, day, nitra, the, impact, of, the, mission, of, cyril, and, methodius, extended, beyond, the, religious, and, political, spheres, old, church, slavonic, became, the, fourth, liturgical, language, of, the, christian, world, however, after, methodius, s, death, 885, all, his, followers, were, expelled, from, great, moravia, accordingly, the, use, of, slavic, liturgy, in, great, moravia, lasted, only, about, 22, years, its, late, form, remains, the, liturgical, language, of, the, ukrainian, russian, bulgarian, macedonian, serbian, and, polish, orthodox, churches, cyril, also, invented, the, glagolitic, alphabet, suitable, for, slavic, languages, and, first, translated, the, bible, into, a, slavic, language, along, with, methodius, who, later, completed, the, project, methodius, wrote, the, first, slavic, legal, code, combining, local, customary, law, with, advanced, byzantine, law, similarly, the, great, moravian, criminal, law, code, was, not, merely, a, translation, from, latin, but, also, punished, a, number, of, offenses, originally, tolerated, by, pre, christian, slavic, mores, yet, prohibited, by, christianity, mostly, related, to, sexual, conduct, the, canon, law, was, simply, adopted, from, byzantine, sources, there, are, not, many, literary, works, that, can, be, unambiguously, identified, as, originally, written, in, great, moravia, one, of, them, is, proglas, a, cultivated, poem, in, which, cyril, defends, the, slavic, liturgy, vita, cyrilli, attributed, to, clement, of, ohrid, and, vita, methodii, probably, written, by, methodius, s, successor, gorazd, are, biographies, with, valuable, information, about, great, moravia, under, rastislav, and, svatopluk, i, the, brothers, also, founded, an, academy, initially, led, by, methodius, which, produced, hundreds, of, slavic, clerics, a, well, educated, class, was, essential, for, administration, of, all, early, feudal, states, and, great, moravia, was, no, exception, vita, methodii, mentions, that, the, bishop, of, nitra, served, as, svatopluk, i, s, chancellor, and, even, prince, koce, of, the, balaton, principality, was, said, to, have, mastered, the, glagolitic, script, the, location, of, the, great, moravian, academy, has, not, been, identified, but, possible, sites, include, mikul, ice, where, some, styli, have, been, found, in, an, ecclesiastical, building, dev, n, castle, with, a, building, identified, as, a, probable, school, and, nitra, with, its, episcopal, basilica, and, monastery, when, methodius, s, disciples, were, expelled, from, great, moravia, by, svatopluk, i, in, 885, they, disseminated, their, knowledge, including, the, glagolitic, script, to, other, slavic, countries, such, as, bulgaria, croatia, and, bohemia, the, cyrillic, script, was, created, in, bulgaria, in, the, preslav, literary, school, which, became, the, standard, alphabet, the, bulgarian, empire, and, later, in, the, kievan, rus, modern, day, russia, ukraine, and, belarus, the, great, moravian, cultural, heritage, was, further, developed, in, bulgarian, seminaries, paving, the, way, for, the, christianization, of, kievan, rus, the, cyrillo, methodian, cultural, mission, had, significant, impact, on, most, slavic, languages, and, stood, at, the, beginning, of, the, modern, cyrillic, alphabet, created, in, the, 9th, century, ad, in, bulgaria, by, bulgarian, disciples, of, cyril, and, methodius, naum, of, preslav, clement, of, ohrid, and, others, in, the, first, half, of, the, 9th, century, great, moravian, craftsmen, were, inspired, by, contemporary, carolingian, art, in, the, second, half, of, the, 9th, century, great, moravian, jewelry, was, influenced, by, byzantine, eastern, mediterranean, and, adriatic, styles, however, in, the, words, of, czech, archaeologist, josef, poul, k, these, new, forms, and, techniques, were, not, copied, passively, but, were, transformed, in, the, local, idiom, establishing, in, this, way, the, roots, of, the, distinctive, great, moravian, jewellery, style, typical, great, moravian, jewelry, included, silver, and, golden, earrings, decorated, by, fine, granular, filigree, as, well, as, silver, and, gilded, bronze, buttons, covered, by, foliate, ornaments, great, moravian, centres, e, g, bratislava, pozsony, pressburg, nitra, nyitra, tekov, bars, and, zempl, n, zempl, n, retained, their, functions, after, the, fall, of, great, moravia, although, the, identification, of, bratislava, tekov, and, zempl, n, as, great, moravian, castles, are, not, generally, accepted, several, sources, suggest, that, hungarian, rulers, followed, the, contemporary, german, or, bulgar, patents, when, they, established, the, new, administrative, system, in, their, kingdom, or, they, introduced, a, new, system, social, differentiation, in, great, moravia, reached, the, state, of, early, feudalism, creating, the, social, basis, for, development, of, later, medieval, states, in, the, region, the, question, what, happened, to, great, moravian, noble, families, after, 907, is, still, under, debate, on, the, one, hand, recent, research, indicates, that, a, significant, part, of, the, local, aristocracy, remained, more, or, less, undisturbed, by, the, fall, of, great, moravia, and, their, descendants, became, nobles, in, the, newly, formed, kingdom, of, hungary, the, most, prominent, example, are, the, powerful, families, of, hunt, and, p, zm, n, on, the, other, hand, both, anonymous, and, simon, of, k, za, two, chroniclers, of, the, early, history, of, hungary, recorded, that, the, prominent, noble, families, of, the, kingdom, descended, either, from, leaders, of, the, magyar, tribes, or, from, immigrants, and, they, did, not, connect, any, of, them, to, great, moravia, for, example, the, ancestors, of, the, clan, hunt, p, zm, n, hont, p, zm, ny, whose, great, moravian, origin, has, been, advanced, by, slovak, scholars, were, reported, by, simon, of, k, za, to, have, arrived, from, the, duchy, of, swabia, in, the, late, 10th, century, the, territories, mentioned, as, tercia, pars, regni, lit, one, third, part, of, the, kingdom, of, hungary, in, the, medieval, sources, are, referred, to, as, the, duchy, in, hungarian, scholarly, works, and, as, the, principality, of, nitra, in, slovak, academic, sources, these, territories, were, ruled, autonomously, by, members, of, the, rp, d, dynasty, residing, in, bihar, today, biharea, in, romania, or, in, nitra, a, practice, reminiscent, of, the, great, moravian, appanage, system, but, also, similar, to, that, of, some, other, dynasties, in, the, early, middle, ages, e, g,
