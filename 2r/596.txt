nigeria, and, the, republic, of, biafra, a, secessionist, state, which, had, declared, its, independence, from, nigeria, in, 1967, nigeria, was, led, by, general, yakubu, gowon, and, biafra, by, lieutenant, colonel, chukwuemeka, emeka, odumegwu, ojukwu, the, conflict, resulted, from, political, ethnic, cultural, and, religious, tensions, which, preceded, the, united, kingdom, s, formal, decolonisation, of, nigeria, from, 1960, to, 1963, immediate, causes, of, the, war, in, 1966, included, a, military, coup, a, counter, coup, and, anti, igbo, pogroms, in, the, northern, region, the, pogroms, and, the, exodus, of, surviving, igbos, from, the, northern, region, to, the, igbo, homelands, in, the, eastern, region, led, the, leadership, of, the, eastern, region, whose, population, was, two, thirds, igbo, to, conclude, that, the, nigerian, federal, government, would, not, protect, them, and, that, they, must, protect, themselves, in, an, independent, biafra, within, a, year, nigerian, government, troops, surrounded, biafra, and, captured, coastal, oil, facilities, and, the, city, of, port, harcourt, a, blockade, was, imposed, as, a, deliberate, policy, during, the, ensuing, stalemate, which, led, to, the, mass, starvation, of, biafran, civilians, during, the, 2, 1, 2, years, of, the, war, there, were, about, 100, 000, overall, military, casualties, while, between, 500, 000, and, 2, million, biafran, civilians, died, of, starvation, alongside, the, concurrent, vietnam, war, the, nigerian, civil, war, was, one, of, the, first, wars, in, human, history, to, be, televised, to, a, global, audience, in, mid, 1968, images, of, malnourished, and, starving, biafran, children, saturated, the, mass, media, of, western, countries, the, plight, of, the, starving, biafrans, became, a, cause, c, l, bre, in, foreign, countries, enabling, a, significant, rise, in, the, funding, and, prominence, of, international, non, governmental, organisations, ngos, biafra, received, international, humanitarian, aid, from, civilians, during, the, biafran, airlift, an, event, which, inspired, the, formation, of, doctors, without, borders, following, the, end, of, the, war, the, united, kingdom, and, the, soviet, union, were, the, main, supporters, of, the, nigerian, government, while, france, israel, after, 1968, and, some, other, countries, supported, biafra, the, united, states, official, position, was, one, of, neutrality, considering, nigeria, as, a, responsibility, of, britain, but, some, interpret, the, refusal, to, recognise, biafra, as, favouring, the, nigerian, government, the, war, highlighted, challenges, within, pan, africanism, during, the, early, stages, of, african, independence, from, colonial, rule, suggesting, that, the, diverse, nature, of, african, peoples, may, present, obstacles, to, achieving, common, unity, additionally, it, shed, light, on, initial, shortcomings, within, the, organization, of, african, unity, the, war, also, resulted, in, the, political, marginalization, of, the, igbo, people, as, nigeria, has, not, had, another, igbo, president, since, the, end, of, the, war, leading, some, igbo, people, to, believe, they, are, being, unfairly, punished, for, the, war, igbo, nationalism, has, emerged, since, the, end, of, the, war, as, well, as, various, neo, biafran, secessionist, groups, such, as, the, indigenous, people, of, biafra, and, movement, for, the, actualization, of, the, sovereign, state, of, biafra, this, civil, war, can, be, connected, to, the, colonial, amalgamation, in, 1914, of, the, northern, protectorate, lagos, colony, and, southern, nigeria, protectorate, which, was, intended, for, better, administration, due, to, the, proximity, of, these, protectorates, however, the, change, did, not, take, into, consideration, the, differences, in, the, culture, and, religions, of, the, people, in, each, area, competition, for, political, and, economic, power, exacerbated, tensions, nigeria, gained, independence, from, the, united, kingdom, on, 1, october, 1960, with, a, population, of, 45, 2, million, made, up, of, more, than, 300, differing, ethnic, and, cultural, groups, when, the, colony, of, nigeria, was, created, its, three, largest, ethnic, groups, were, the, igbo, who, formed, about, 60, 70, of, the, population, in, the, southeast, the, hausa, fulani, of, the, sokoto, caliphate, who, formed, about, 67, of, the, population, in, the, northern, part, of, the, territory, and, the, yoruba, who, formed, about, 75, of, the, population, in, the, southwest, although, these, groups, have, their, homelands, by, the, 1960s, the, people, were, dispersed, across, nigeria, with, all, three, ethnic, groups, represented, substantially, in, major, cities, when, the, war, broke, out, in, 1967, there, were, still, 5, 000, igbos, in, lagos, the, semi, feudal, and, muslim, hausa, fulani, in, the, north, were, traditionally, ruled, by, a, conservative, islamic, hierarchy, consisting, of, emirs, who, in, turn, owed, their, ultimate, allegiance, to, the, sultan, of, sokoto, whom, they, regarded, as, the, source, of, all, political, power, and, religious, authority, apart, from, the, hausa, fulani, the, kanuri, were, another, dominant, majority, muslim, ethnic, group, that, had, key, figures, in, the, war, they, made, up, about, 5, of, nigeria, s, population, and, were, the, dominant, ethnic, group, in, the, north, eastern, state, they, historically, successfully, resisted, the, sokoto, caliphate, during, the, 19th, century, through, their, millennium, long, kanem, bornu, empire, the, southernmost, part, of, the, region, known, as, the, middle, belt, had, large, populations, of, christian, and, animist, populations, through, missionary, activities, and, the, northernisation, policy, of, the, regional, government, the, subregion, had, a, significant, eurocentric, educated, population, several, key, figures, on, the, nigerian, side, of, the, war, came, from, this, subregion, such, as, yakubu, gowon, and, theophilus, danjuma, both, of, whom, are, christians, the, yoruba, political, system, in, the, southwest, like, that, of, the, hausa, fulani, also, consisted, of, a, series, of, monarchs, the, oba, the, yoruba, monarchs, however, were, less, autocratic, than, those, in, the, north, the, political, and, social, system, of, the, yoruba, accordingly, allowed, for, greater, upward, mobility, based, on, acquired, rather, than, inherited, wealth, and, title, in, contrast, to, the, two, other, groups, igbos, and, the, ethnic, groups, of, the, niger, delta, in, the, southeast, lived, mostly, in, autonomous, democratically, organised, communities, although, there, were, e, ze, or, monarchs, in, many, of, the, ancient, cities, such, as, the, kingdom, of, nri, at, its, zenith, the, kingdom, controlled, most, of, igboland, including, influence, on, the, anioma, people, arochukwu, which, controlled, slavery, in, igbo, and, onitsha, territory, unlike, the, other, two, regions, decisions, within, the, igbo, communities, were, made, by, a, general, assembly, in, which, men, and, women, participated, considering, this, participation, by, women, in, this, civil, war, the, study, female, fighters, and, the, fates, of, rebellions, how, mobilizing, women, influences, conflict, duration, by, reed, m, wood, observed, that, there, was, a, longer, duration, of, wars, between, rebel, groups, and, the, number, of, women, that, participated, within, the, conflict, at, hand, in, discussing, the, correlation, between, conflicts, of, longer, duration, and, a, high, rate, of, participation, of, women, the, study, suggests, that, gender, norms, and, the, general, ways, in, which, an, armed, group, recruits, as, well, as, who, it, recruits, may, subsequently, influence, its, behaviors, during, the, conflict, and, the, manner, in, which, the, conflict, unfolds, the, differing, political, systems, and, structures, reflected, and, produced, divergent, customs, and, values, the, hausa, fulani, commoners, having, contact, with, the, political, system, only, through, a, village, head, designated, by, the, emir, or, one, of, his, subordinates, did, not, view, political, leaders, as, amenable, to, influence, political, decisions, were, to, be, submitted, to, as, with, many, other, authoritarian, religious, and, political, systems, leadership, positions, were, given, to, persons, willing, to, be, subservient, and, loyal, to, superiors, a, chief, function, of, this, political, system, in, this, context, was, to, maintain, conservative, values, which, caused, many, hausa, fulani, to, view, economic, and, social, innovation, as, subversive, or, sacrilegious, in, contrast, to, the, hausa, fulani, the, igbos, and, other, biafrans, often, participated, directly, in, the, decisions, which, affected, their, lives, they, had, a, lively, awareness, of, the, political, system, and, regarded, it, as, an, instrument, for, achieving, their, personal, goals, status, was, acquired, through, the, ability, to, arbitrate, disputes, that, might, arise, in, the, village, and, through, acquiring, rather, than, inheriting, wealth, the, igbo, had, been, substantially, victimised, in, the, atlantic, slave, trade, in, the, year, 1790, it, was, reported, that, of, 20, 000, people, sold, each, year, from, bonny, 16, 000, were, igbo, with, their, emphasis, upon, social, achievement, and, political, participation, the, igbo, adapted, to, and, challenged, colonial, rule, in, innovative, ways, these, tradition, derived, differences, were, perpetuated, and, perhaps, enhanced, by, the, colonial, government, in, nigeria, in, the, north, the, colonial, government, found, it, convenient, to, rule, indirectly, through, the, emirs, thus, perpetuating, rather, than, changing, the, indigenous, authoritarian, political, system, christian, missionaries, were, excluded, from, the, north, and, the, area, thus, remained, virtually, closed, to, european, cultural, influence, by, contrast, the, richest, of, the, igbo, often, sent, their, sons, to, british, universities, with, the, intention, of, preparing, them, to, work, with, the, british, during, the, ensuing, years, the, northern, emirs, maintained, their, traditional, political, and, religious, institutions, while, reinforcing, their, social, structure, at, the, time, of, independence, in, 1960, the, north, was, by, far, the, most, underdeveloped, area, in, nigeria, it, had, an, english, literacy, rate, of, 2, as, compared, to, 19, 2, in, the, east, literacy, in, ajami, local, languages, in, arabic, script, learned, in, connection, with, religious, education, was, much, higher, the, west, also, enjoyed, a, much, higher, literacy, level, as, it, was, the, first, part, of, the, country, to, have, contact, with, western, education, and, established, a, free, primary, education, program, under, the, pre, independence, western, regional, government, in, the, west, the, missionaries, rapidly, introduced, western, forms, of, education, consequently, the, yoruba, were, the, first, group, in, nigeria, to, adopt, western, bureaucratic, social, norms, they, made, up, the, first, classes, of, african, civil, servants, doctors, lawyers, and, other, technicians, and, professionals, missionaries, were, introduced, at, a, later, date, in, eastern, areas, because, the, british, experienced, difficulty, establishing, firm, control, over, the, highly, autonomous, communities, there, however, the, igbo, and, other, biafran, people, actively, embraced, western, education, and, they, overwhelmingly, came, to, adopt, christianity, population, pressure, in, the, igbo, homeland, combined, with, aspirations, for, monetary, wages, drove, thousands, of, igbos, to, other, parts, of, nigeria, in, search, of, work, by, the, 1960s, igbo, political, culture, was, more, unified, and, the, region, relatively, prosperous, with, tradesmen, and, literate, elites, active, not, just, in, the, traditionally, igbo, east, but, throughout, nigeria, by, 1966, the, traditional, ethnic, and, religious, differences, between, northerners, and, the, igbo, were, exacerbated, by, new, differences, in, education, and, economic, class, the, colonial, administration, divided, nigeria, into, three, regions, north, west, and, east, something, which, exacerbated, the, already, well, developed, economic, political, and, social, differences, among, nigeria, s, different, ethnic, groups, the, country, was, divided, in, such, a, way, that, the, north, had, a, slightly, higher, population, than, the, other, two, regions, combined, there, were, also, widespread, reports, of, fraud, during, nigeria, s, first, census, and, even, today, population, remains, a, highly, political, issue, in, nigeria, on, this, basis, the, northern, region, was, allocated, a, majority, of, the, seats, in, the, federal, legislature, established, by, the, colonial, authorities, within, each, of, the, three, regions, the, dominant, ethnic, groups, the, hausa, fulani, yoruba, and, igbo, respectively, formed, political, parties, that, were, largely, regional, and, based, on, ethnic, allegiances, the, northern, people, s, congress, npc, in, the, north, the, action, group, in, the, west, ag, and, the, national, council, of, nigeria, and, the, cameroons, ncnc, in, the, east, although, these, parties, were, not, exclusively, homogeneous, in, terms, of, their, ethnic, or, regional, make, up, the, disintegration, of, nigeria, resulted, largely, from, the, fact, that, these, parties, were, primarily, based, in, one, region, and, one, tribe, the, basis, of, modern, nigeria, formed, in, 1914, when, the, united, kingdom, amalgamated, the, northern, and, southern, protectorates, beginning, with, the, northern, protectorate, the, british, implemented, a, system, of, indirect, rule, of, which, they, exerted, influence, through, alliances, with, local, forces, this, system, worked, so, well, colonial, governor, frederick, lugard, successfully, lobbied, to, extend, it, to, the, southern, protectorate, through, amalgamation, in, this, way, a, foreign, and, hierarchical, system, of, governance, was, imposed, on, the, igbos, intellectuals, began, to, agitate, for, greater, rights, and, independence, the, size, of, this, intellectual, class, increased, significantly, in, the, 1950s, with, the, massive, expansion, of, the, national, education, program, during, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, the, igbo, and, yoruba, parties, were, in, the, forefront, of, the, campaign, for, independence, from, british, rule, northern, leaders, fearful, that, independence, would, mean, political, and, economic, domination, by, the, more, westernized, elites, in, the, south, preferred, the, continuation, of, british, rule, as, a, condition, for, accepting, independence, they, demanded, that, the, country, continue, to, be, divided, into, three, regions, with, the, north, having, a, clear, majority, igbo, and, yoruba, leaders, anxious, to, obtain, an, independent, country, at, all, costs, accepted, the, northern, demands, however, the, two, southern, regions, had, significant, cultural, and, ideological, differences, leading, to, discord, between, the, two, southern, political, parties, firstly, the, ag, favoured, a, loose, confederacy, of, regions, in, the, emergent, nigerian, nation, whereby, each, region, would, be, in, total, control, of, its, own, distinct, territory, the, status, of, lagos, was, a, sore, point, for, the, ag, which, did, not, want, lagos, a, yoruba, town, situated, in, western, nigeria, which, was, at, that, time, the, federal, capital, and, seat, of, national, government, to, be, designated, as, the, capital, of, nigeria, if, it, meant, loss, of, yoruba, sovereignty, the, ag, insisted, that, lagos, must, be, completely, recognised, as, a, yoruba, town, without, any, loss, of, identity, control, or, autonomy, by, the, yoruba, contrary, to, this, position, the, ncnc, was, anxious, to, declare, lagos, by, virtue, of, it, being, the, federal, capital, territory, as, no, man, s, land, a, declaration, which, as, could, be, expected, angered, the, ag, which, offered, to, help, fund, the, development, of, another, territory, in, nigeria, as, federal, capital, territory, and, then, threatened, secession, from, nigeria, if, it, didn, t, get, its, way, the, threat, of, secession, by, the, ag, was, tabled, documented, and, recorded, in, numerous, constitutional, conferences, including, the, constitutional, conference, held, in, london, in, 1954, with, the, demand, that, a, right, of, secession, be, enshrined, in, the, constitution, of, the, emerging, nigerian, nation, to, allow, any, part, of, the, emergent, nation, to, opt, out, of, nigeria, should, the, need, arise, this, proposal, for, inclusion, of, right, of, secession, by, the, regions, in, independent, nigeria, by, the, ag, was, rejected, and, resisted, by, ncnc, which, vehemently, argued, for, a, tightly, bound, united, unitary, structured, nation, because, it, viewed, the, provision, of, a, secession, clause, as, detrimental, to, the, formation, of, a, unitary, nigerian, state, in, the, face, of, sustained, opposition, by, the, ncnc, delegates, later, joined, by, the, npc, and, backed, by, threats, to, view, maintenance, of, the, inclusion, of, secession, by, the, ag, as, treasonable, by, the, british, the, ag, was, forced, to, renounce, its, position, of, inclusion, of, the, right, of, secession, a, part, of, the, nigerian, constitution, had, such, a, provision, been, made, in, the, nigerian, constitution, later, events, which, led, to, the, nigerian, biafran, civil, war, may, have, been, avoided, the, pre, independence, alliance, between, the, ncnc, and, the, npc, against, the, aspirations, of, the, ag, would, later, set, the, tone, for, political, governance, of, independent, nigeria, by, the, ncnc, npc, and, lead, to, disaster, in, later, years, in, nigeria, northern, southern, tension, manifested, firstly, in, the, 1945, jos, riots, and, again, on, 1, may, 1953, as, fighting, in, the, northern, city, of, kano, the, political, parties, tended, to, focus, on, building, power, in, their, own, regions, resulting, in, an, incoherent, and, disunified, dynamic, in, the, federal, government, in, 1946, the, british, divided, the, southern, region, into, the, western, region, and, the, eastern, region, each, government, was, entitled, to, collect, royalties, from, resources, extracted, within, its, area, this, changed, in, 1956, when, shell, bp, found, large, petroleum, deposits, in, the, eastern, region, a, commission, led, by, sir, jeremy, raisman, and, ronald, tress, determined, that, resource, royalties, would, now, enter, a, distributable, pools, account, with, the, money, split, between, different, parts, of, government, 50, to, region, of, origin, 20, to, federal, government, 30, to, other, regions, to, ensure, continuing, influence, the, british, government, promoted, unity, in, the, northern, bloc, and, secessionist, sentiments, among, and, within, the, two, southern, regions, the, nigerian, government, following, independence, promoted, discord, in, the, west, with, the, creation, of, a, new, mid, western, region, in, an, area, with, oil, potential, the, new, constitution, of, 1946, also, proclaimed, that, the, entire, property, in, and, control, of, all, mineral, oils, in, under, or, upon, any, lands, in, nigeria, and, of, all, rivers, streams, and, watercourses, throughout, nigeria, is, and, shall, be, vested, in, the, crown, the, united, kingdom, profited, significantly, from, a, fivefold, rise, in, nigerian, exports, amidst, the, post, war, economic, boom, nigeria, gained, independence, on, 1, october, 1960, and, the, first, republic, came, to, be, on, 1, october, 1963,

1963, culminating, in, a, nationwide, general, strike, in, june, 1964, strikers, disobeyed, an, ultimatum, to, return, to, work, and, at, one, point, were, dispersed, by, riot, police, eventually, they, did, win, wage, increases, the, strike, included, people, from, all, ethnic, groups, retired, brigadier, general, h, m, njoku, later, wrote, that, the, general, strike, heavily, exacerbated, tensions, between, the, army, and, ordinary, civilians, and, put, pressure, on, the, army, to, take, action, against, a, government, which, was, widely, perceived, as, corrupt, the, 1964, elections, which, involved, heavy, campaigning, all, year, brought, ethnic, and, regional, divisions, into, focus, resentment, of, politicians, ran, high, and, many, campaigners, feared, for, their, safety,

become, the, tenth, biggest, oil, exporter, in, the, world, though, the, nigeria, regiment, had, fought, for, the, united, kingdom, in, both, the, first, and, second, world, wars, the, army, nigeria, inherited, upon, independence, in, 1960, was, an, internal, security, force, designed, and, trained, to, assist, the, police, in, putting, down, challenges, to, authority, rather, than, to, fight, a, war, the, indian, historian, pradeep, barua, called, the, nigerian, army, in, 1960, a, glorified, police, force, and, even, after, independence, the, nigerian, military, retained, the, role, it, held, under, the, british, in, the, 1950s, the, nigerian, army, did, not, conduct, field, training, and, notably, lacked, heavy, weapons, before, 1948, nigerians, were, not, allowed, to, hold, officer, s, commissions, and, only, in, 1948, were, certain, promising, nigerian, recruits, allowed, to, attend, sandhurst, for, officer, training, while, at, the, same, time, nigerian, ncos, were, allowed, to, become, officers, if, they, completed, a, course, in, officer, training, at, mons, hall, or, eaton, hall, in, england, despite, the, reforms, only, an, average, of, two, nigerians, per, year, were, awarded, officers, commissions, between, 1948, 55, and, only, seven, per, year, from, 1955, to, 1960, at, the, time, of, independence, in, 1960, of, the, 257, officers, commanding, the, nigeria, regiment, which, became, the, nigerian, army, only, 57, were, nigerians, using, the, martial, races, theory, first, developed, under, the, raj, in, 19th, century, india, the, colonial, government, had, decided, that, peoples, from, northern, nigeria, such, as, the, hausa, kiv, and, kanuri, were, the, hard, martial, races, whose, recruitment, was, encouraged, while, the, peoples, from, southern, nigeria, such, as, the, igbos, and, the, yoruba, were, viewed, as, too, soft, to, make, for, good, soldiers, and, hence, their, recruitment, was, discouraged, as, a, result, by, 1958, men, from, northern, nigeria, made, up, 62, of, the, nigeria, regiment, while, men, from, the, south, and, the, west, made, up, only, 36, in, 1958, the, policy, was, changed, henceforward, men, from, the, north, would, make, up, only, 50, of, the, soldiers, while, men, from, the, southeast, and, southwest, were, each, to, make, up, 25, the, new, policy, was, retained, after, independence, the, previously, favoured, northerners, whose, egos, had, been, stoked, by, being, told, by, their, officers, that, they, were, the, tough, and, hardy, martial, races, greatly, resented, the, change, in, recruitment, policies, all, the, more, as, after, independence, in, 1960, there, were, opportunities, for, nigerian, men, to, serve, as, officers, that, had, not, existed, prior, to, independence, as, men, from, the, southeast, and, southwest, were, generally, much, better, educated, than, men, from, the, north, they, were, much, more, likely, to, be, promoted, to, officers, in, the, newly, founded, nigerian, army, which, provoked, further, resentment, from, the, northerners, at, the, same, time, as, a, part, of, nigerianisation, policy, it, was, government, policy, to, send, home, the, british, officers, who, had, been, retained, after, independence, by, promoting, as, many, nigerians, as, possible, until, by, 1966, there, were, no, more, british, officers, as, part, of, the, nigerianisation, policy, educational, standards, for, officers, were, drastically, lowered, with, only, a, high, school, diploma, being, necessary, for, an, officer, s, commission, while, at, the, same, time, nigerianisation, resulted, in, an, extremely, youthful, officer, corps, full, of, ambitious, men, who, disliked, the, sandhurst, graduates, who, served, in, the, high, command, as, blocking, further, chances, for, promotion, a, group, of, igbo, officers, formed, a, conspiracy, to, overthrow, the, government, seeing, the, northern, prime, minister, sir, abubakar, tafawa, balewa, as, allegedly, plundering, the, oil, wealth, of, the, southeast, on, 15, january, 1966, major, chukuma, kaduna, nzeogwu, major, emmanuel, ifeajuna, and, other, junior, army, officers, mostly, majors, and, captains, attempted, a, coup, d, tat, the, two, major, political, leaders, of, the, north, the, prime, minister, sir, abubakar, tafawa, balewa, and, the, premier, of, the, northern, region, sir, ahmadu, bello, were, killed, by, major, nzeogwu, also, murdered, was, bello, s, wife, and, officers, of, northern, extraction, the, president, sir, nnamdi, azikiwe, an, igbo, was, on, an, extended, vacation, in, the, west, indies, he, did, not, return, until, days, after, the, coup, there, was, widespread, suspicion, that, the, igbo, coup, plotters, had, tipped, him, and, other, igbo, leaders, off, regarding, the, pending, coup, in, addition, to, the, killings, of, the, northern, political, leaders, the, premier, of, the, western, region, ladoke, akintola, and, yoruba, senior, military, officers, were, also, killed, this, coup, of, the, five, majors, has, been, described, in, some, quarters, as, nigeria, s, only, revolutionary, coup, this, was, the, first, coup, in, the, short, life, of, nigeria, s, nascent, second, democracy, claims, of, electoral, fraud, were, one, of, the, reasons, given, by, the, coup, plotters, besides, killing, much, of, nigeria, s, elite, the, coup, also, saw, much, of, the, leadership, of, the, nigerian, federal, army, killed, with, seven, officers, holding, the, rank, above, colonel, killed, of, the, seven, officers, killed, four, were, northerners, two, were, from, the, southeast, and, one, was, from, the, midwest, only, one, was, an, igbo, this, coup, was, however, not, seen, as, a, revolutionary, coup, by, other, sections, of, nigerians, especially, in, the, northern, and, western, sections, and, by, later, revisionists, of, nigerian, coups, some, alleged, mostly, from, eastern, part, of, nigeria, that, the, majors, sought, to, spring, action, group, leader, obafemi, awolowo, out, of, jail, and, make, him, head, of, the, new, government, their, intention, was, to, dismantle, the, northern, dominated, power, structure, but, their, efforts, to, take, power, were, unsuccessful, johnson, aguiyi, ironsi, an, igbo, and, loyalist, head, of, the, nigerian, army, suppressed, coup, operations, in, the, south, and, he, was, declared, head, of, state, on, 16, january, after, the, surrender, of, the, majors, in, the, end, though, the, majors, were, not, in, the, position, to, embark, on, this, political, goal, while, their, 15th, january, coup, succeeded, in, seizing, political, control, in, the, north, it, failed, in, the, south, especially, in, the, lagos, ibadan, abeokuta, military, district, where, loyalist, troops, led, by, army, commander, johnson, aguyi, ironsi, succeeded, in, crushing, the, revolt, apart, from, ifeajuna, who, fled, the, country, after, the, collapse, of, their, coup, the, other, two, january, majors, and, the, rest, of, the, military, officers, involved, in, the, revolt, later, surrendered, to, the, loyalist, high, command, and, were, subsequently, detained, as, a, federal, investigation, of, the, event, began, aguyi, ironsi, suspended, the, constitution, and, dissolved, parliament, he, abolished, the, regional, confederated, form, of, government, and, pursued, unitary, policies, favoured, by, the, ncnc, having, apparently, been, influenced, by, ncnc, political, philosophy, he, however, appointed, colonel, hassan, katsina, son, of, katsina, emir, usman, nagogo, to, govern, the, northern, region, indicating, some, willingness, to, maintain, cooperation, with, this, bloc, he, also, preferentially, released, northern, politicians, from, jail, enabling, them, to, plan, his, forthcoming, overthrow, aguyi, ironsi, rejected, a, british, offer, of, military, support, but, promised, to, protect, british, interests, ironsi, fatally, did, not, bring, the, failed, plotters, to, trial, as, required, by, then, military, law, and, as, advised, by, most, northern, and, western, officers, rather, coup, plotters, were, maintained, in, the, military, on, full, pay, and, some, were, even, promoted, while, awaiting, trial, the, coup, despite, its, failures, was, seen, by, many, as, primarily, benefiting, the, igbo, peoples, as, the, plotters, received, no, repercussions, for, their, actions, and, no, significant, igbo, political, leaders, were, affected, while, those, that, executed, the, coup, were, mostly, northern, most, of, the, known, plotters, were, igbo, and, the, military, and, political, leadership, of, western, and, northern, regions, had, been, largely, bloodily, eliminated, while, the, eastern, military, political, leadership, was, largely, untouched, however, ironsi, himself, an, igbo, was, thought, to, have, made, numerous, attempts, to, please, northerners, the, other, events, that, also, fuelled, suspicions, of, a, so, called, igbo, conspiracy, were, the, killing, of, northern, leaders, and, the, killing, of, the, brigadier, general, ademulegun, s, pregnant, wife, by, the, coup, executioners, among, the, igbo, people, reaction, to, the, coup, was, mixed, despite, the, overwhelming, contradictions, of, the, coup, being, executed, by, mostly, northern, soldiers, such, as, john, atom, kpera, later, military, governor, of, benue, state, the, killing, of, igbo, soldier, lieutenant, colonel, arthur, unegbe, by, coup, executioners, and, ironsi, s, termination, of, an, igbo, led, coup, the, ease, by, which, ironsi, stopped, the, coup, led, to, suspicion, that, the, igbo, coup, plotters, planned, all, along, to, pave, the, way, for, ironsi, to, take, the, reins, of, power, in, nigeria, colonel, odumegwu, ojukwu, became, military, governor, of, the, eastern, region, at, this, time, on, 24, may, 1966, the, military, government, issued, unification, decree, 34, which, would, have, replaced, the, federation, with, a, more, centralised, system, the, northern, bloc, found, this, decree, intolerable, in, the, face, of, provocation, from, the, eastern, media, which, repeatedly, showed, humiliating, posters, and, cartoons, of, the, slain, northern, politicians, on, the, night, of, 29, july, 1966, northern, soldiers, at, abeokuta, barracks, mutinied, thus, precipitating, a, counter, coup, which, had, already, been, in, the, planning, stages, ironsi, was, on, a, visit, to, ibadan, during, their, mutiny, and, there, he, was, killed, along, with, his, host, adekunle, fajuyi, the, counter, coup, led, to, the, installation, of, lieutenant, colonel, yakubu, gowon, as, supreme, commander, of, the, nigerian, armed, forces, gowon, was, chosen, as, a, compromise, candidate, he, was, a, northerner, a, christian, from, a, minority, tribe, and, had, a, good, reputation, within, the, army, it, seems, that, gowon, immediately, faced, not, only, a, potential, standoff, with, the, east, but, secession, threats, from, the, northern, and, even, the, western, region, the, counter, coup, plotters, had, considered, using, the, opportunity, to, withdraw, from, the, federation, themselves, ambassadors, from, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, however, urged, gowon, to, maintain, control, over, the, whole, country, gowon, followed, this, plan, repealing, the, unification, decree, announcing, a, return, to, the, federal, system, after, the, january, coup, igbos, in, the, north, were, accused, of, taunting, their, hosts, on, the, loss, of, their, leaders, a, popular, example, was, celestine, ukwu, a, popular, igbo, musician, who, released, a, song, titled, ewu, ne, ba, akwa, goats, are, crying, apparently, mocking, the, late, ahmadu, bello, these, provocations, were, so, pervasive, that, they, warranted, the, promulgation, of, decree, 44, of, 1966, banning, them, by, the, military, government, the, first, president, of, nigeria, nnamdi, azikiwe, who, was, away, during, the, first, coup, noted, some, ibo, elements, who, were, domiciled, in, northern, nigeria, taunted, northerners, by, defaming, their, leaders, through, means, of, records, or, songs, or, pictures, they, also, published, pamphlets, and, postcards, which, displayed, a, peculiar, representation, of, certain, northerners, living, or, dead, in, a, manner, likely, to, provoke, disaffection, from, june, through, october, 1966, pogroms, in, the, north, killed, an, estimated, 10, 000, to, 30, 000, igbo, half, of, them, children, and, caused, more, than, a, million, to, two, million, to, flee, to, the, eastern, region, 29, september, 1966, became, known, as, black, thursday, as, it, was, considered, the, worst, day, of, the, massacres, ethnomusicologist, charles, keil, who, was, visiting, nigeria, in, 1966, recounted, the, pogroms, i, witnessed, in, makurdi, nigeria, late, sept, 1966, were, foreshadowed, by, months, of, intensive, anti, igbo, and, anti, eastern, conversations, among, tiv, idoma, hausa, and, other, northerners, resident, in, makurdi, and, fitting, a, pattern, replicated, in, city, after, city, the, massacres, were, led, by, the, nigerian, army, before, during, and, after, the, slaughter, col, gowon, could, be, heard, over, the, radio, issuing, guarantees, of, safety, to, all, easterners, all, citizens, of, nigeria, but, the, intent, of, the, soldiers, the, only, power, that, counts, in, nigeria, now, or, then, was, painfully, clear, after, counting, the, disemboweled, bodies, along, the, makurdi, road, i, was, escorted, back, to, the, city, by, soldiers, who, apologised, for, the, stench, and, explained, politely, that, they, were, doing, me, and, the, world, a, great, favor, by, eliminating, igbos, professor, of, history, murray, last, who, was, in, zaria, city, on, the, day, after, the, first, coup, describes, his, experience, on, that, day, and, the, day, after, the, coup, january, 16th, 1966, there, was, initially, so, much, open, relief, on, the, abu, campus, that, it, shocked, me, it, was, only, later, when, i, was, living, within, zaria, city, at, babban, dodo, that, i, encountered, the, anger, at, the, way, igbo, traders, and, journalists, were, mocking, their, hausa, fellow, traders, in, zaria, s, sabon, gari, over, the, death, of, their, father, and, were, pushing, aside, various, motorpark, workers, elsewhere, telling, the, hausa, that, the, rules, had, now, all, changed, and, it, was, the, hausa, who, were, now, the, underlings, in, market, or, motorpark, the, federal, military, government, also, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, economic, blockade, of, the, eastern, region, which, went, into, full, effect, in, 1967, the, deluge, of, refugees, in, eastern, nigeria, created, a, difficult, situation, extensive, negotiations, took, place, between, ojukwu, representing, eastern, nigeria, and, gowon, representing, the, nigerian, federal, military, government, in, the, aburi, accord, finally, signed, at, aburi, ghana, the, parties, agreed, that, a, looser, nigerian, federation, would, be, implemented, gowon, delayed, announcement, of, the, agreement, and, eventually, reneged, on, 27, may, 1967, gowon, proclaimed, the, division, of, nigeria, into, twelve, states, this, decree, carved, the, eastern, region, in, three, parts, south, eastern, state, rivers, state, and, east, central, state, now, the, igbos, concentrated, in, the, east, central, state, would, lose, control, over, most, of, the, petroleum, located, in, the, other, two, areas, the, federal, military, government, immediately, placed, an, embargo, on, all, shipping, to, and, from, biafra, but, not, on, oil, tankers, biafra, quickly, moved, to, collect, oil, royalties, from, oil, companies, doing, business, within, its, borders, when, shell, bp, acquiesced, to, this, request, at, the, end, of, june, the, federal, government, extended, its, blockade, to, include, oil, the, blockade, which, most, foreign, actors, accepted, played, a, decisive, role, in, putting, biafra, at, a, disadvantage, from, the, beginning, of, the, war, although, the, very, young, nation, had, a, chronic, shortage, of, weapons, to, go, to, war, it, was, determined, to, defend, itself, although, there, was, much, sympathy, in, europe, and, elsewhere, only, five, countries, tanzania, gabon, ivory, coast, zambia, and, haiti, officially, recognised, the, new, republic, the, united, kingdom, supplied, heavy, weapons, and, ammunition, to, the, nigerian, side, officially, to, preserve, the, multi, ethnic, country, it, had, created, but, also, to, preserve, the, supply, of, nigerian, oil, to, the, united, kingdom, and, to, protect, the, investments, of, shell, bp, the, biafra, side, received, arms, and, ammunition, from, france, even, though, the, french, government, denied, sponsoring, biafra, an, article, in, paris, match, of, 20, november, 1968, claimed, that, french, arms, were, reaching, biafra, through, neighbouring, countries, such, as, gabon, the, heavy, supply, of, weapons, by, the, united, kingdom, was, the, biggest, factor, in, determining, the, outcome, of, the, war, several, peace, accords, were, held, with, the, most, notable, one, held, at, aburi, ghana, the, aburi, accord, there, were, different, accounts, of, what, took, place, in, aburi, ojukwu, accused, the, federal, government, of, going, back, on, their, promises, while, the, federal, government, accused, ojukwu, of, distortion, and, half, truths, ojukwu, gained, agreement, to, a, confederation, for, nigeria, rather, than, a, federation, he, was, warned, by, his, advisers, that, gowon, did, not, understand, the, difference, and, would, renege, upon, the, agreement, when, this, happened, ojukwu, regarded, it, as, both, a, failure, by, gowon, to, keep, to, the, spirit, of, the, aburi, agreement, and, a, lack, of, integrity, on, the, side, of, the, nigerian, military, government, in, the, negotiations, toward, a, united, nigeria, gowon, s, advisers, to, the, contrary, felt, that, he, had, enacted, as, much, as, was, politically, feasible, in, fulfilment, of, the, spirit, of, aburi, the, eastern, region, was, very, ill, equipped, for, war, outmanned, and, outgunned, by, the, nigerians, but, had, the, advantages, of, fighting, in, their, homeland, support, of, most, easterners, determination, and, use, of, limited, resources, the, united, kingdom, which, still, maintained, the, highest, level, of, influence, over, nigeria, s, highly, valued, oil, industry, through, shell, bp, and, the, soviet, union, supported, the, nigerian, government, especially, by, military, supplies, the, nigerian, army, in, 1967, was, completely, unready, for, war, the, nigerian, army, had, no, training, or, experience, of, war, on, the, operational, level, still, being, primarily, an, internal, security, force, most, nigerian, officers, were, more, concerned, with, their, social, lives, than, military, training, spending, a, disproportionate, amount, of, their, time, on, partying, drinking, hunting, and, playing, games, social, status, in, the, army, was, extremely, important, and, officers, devoted, an, excessive, amount, of, time, to, ensure, their, uniforms, were, always, immaculate, while, there, was, a, competition, to, own, the, most, expensive, automobiles, and, homes, the, killings, and, purges, perpetuated, during, the, two, coups, of, 1966, had, killed, most, of, the, sandhurst, graduates, by, july, 1966, all, of, the, officers, holding, the, rank, above, colonel, had, been, either, killed, or, discharged, while, only, 5, officers, holding, the, rank, of, lieutenant, colonel, were, still, alive, and, on, duty, almost, all, of, the, junior, officers, had, received, their, commissions, after, 1960, and, most, were, heavily, dependent, on, the, more, experienced, ncos, to, provide, the, necessary, leadership, the, same, problems, that, afflicted, the, federal, army, also, affected, the, biafran, army, even, more, whose, officer, corps, was, based, around, former, federal, igbo, officers, the, shortage, of, experienced, officers, was, a, major, problem, for, the, biafran, army, made, worse, by, a, climate, of, paranoia, and, suspicion, within, biafra, as, ojukwu, believed, that, other, former, federal, officers, were, plotting, against, him, shortly, after, extending, its, blockade, to, include, oil, the, nigerian, government, launched, a, police, action, to, retake, the, secessionist, territory, the, war, began, in, the, early, hours, of, 6, july, 1967, when, nigerian, federal, troops, advanced, in, two, columns, into, biafra, the, biafra, strategy, had, succeeded, the, federal, government, had, started, the, war, and, the, east, was, defending, itself, the, nigerian, army, offensive, was, through, the, north, of, biafra, led, by, colonel, mohammed, shuwa, and, the, local, military, units, were, formed, as, the, 1st, infantry, division, the, division, was, led, mostly, by, northern, officers, after, facing, unexpectedly, fierce, resistance, and, high, casualties, the, western, nigerian, column, advanced, on, the, town, of, nsukka, which, fell, on, 14, july, while, the, eastern, column, made, for, garkem, which, was, captured, on, 12, july, the, biafrans, responded, with, an, offensive, of, their, own, on, 9, august, biafran, forces, crossed, their, western, border, and, the, niger, river, into, the, mid, western, state, of, nigeria, passing, through, the, state, capital, of, benin, city, the, biafrans, advanced, west, until, 21, august, when, they, were, stopped, at, ore, in, present, day, ondo, state, 210, kilometres, 130, mi, east, of, the, nigerian, capital, of, lagos, the, biafran, attack, was, led, by, lt, col, banjo, yoruba, man, with, the, biafran, rank, of, brigadier, the, attack, met, little, resistance, and, the, mid, western, state, was, easily, taken, over, this, was, due, to, the, pre, secession, arrangement, that, all, soldiers, should, return, to, their, regions, to, stop, the, spate, of, killings, in, which, igbo, soldiers, had, been, major, victims, the, nigerian, soldiers, who, were, supposed, to, defend, the, mid, western, state, were, mostly, igbo, from, that, state, and, while, some, were, in, touch, with, their, biafran, counterparts, others, resisted, the, invasion, general, gowon, responded, by, asking, colonel, murtala, mohammed, who, later, became, head, of, state, in, 1975, to, form, another, division, the, 2nd, infantry, division, to, expel, the, biafrans, from, the, mid, western, state, to, defend, the, border, of, the, western, state, and, to, attack, biafra, at, the, same, time, gowon, declared, total, war, and, announced, the, federal, government, would, mobilise, the, entire, population, of, nigeria, for, the, war, effort, from, the, summer, of, 1967, to, the, spring, of, 1969, the, federal, army, grew, from, a, force, of, 7, 000, to, a, force, of, 200, 000, men, organised, in, three, divisions, biafra, began, the, war, with, only, 230, soldiers, at, enugu, which, grew, to, two, battalions, by, august, 1967, which, soon, were, expanded, into, two, brigades, the, 51st, and, 52nd, which, became, the, core, of, the, biafran, army, by, 1969, the, biafrans, were, to, field, 90, 000, soldiers, formed, into, five, undermanned, divisions, together, with, a, number, of, independent, units, as, nigerian, forces, retook, the, mid, western, state, the, biafran, military, administrator, declared, it, to, be, the, republic, of, benin, on, 19, september, though, it, ceased, to, exist, the, next, day, the, present, country, of, benin, west, of, nigeria, was, still, named, dahomey, at, that, time, although, benin, city, was, retaken, by, the, nigerians, on, 22, september, the, biafrans, succeeded, in, their, primary, objective, by, tying, down, as, many, nigerian, federal, troops, as, they, could, gen, gowon, also, launched, an, offensive, into, biafra, south, from, the, niger, delta, to, the, riverine, area, using, the, bulk, of, the, lagos, garrison, command, under, colonel, benjamin, adekunle, called, the, black, scorpion, to, form, the, 3rd, infantry, division, which, was, later, renamed, as, the, 3rd, marine, commando, as, the, war, continued, the, nigerian, army, recruited, amongst, a, wider, area, including, the, yoruba, itshekiri, urhobo, edo, ijaw, etc, the, command, was, divided, into, two, brigades, with, three, battalions, each, the, 1st, brigade, advanced, on, the, axis, of, the, ogugu, ogunga, nsukka, road, while, the, 2nd, brigade, advanced, on, the, axis, of, the, gakem, obudu, ogoja, road, by, 10, july, 1967, the, 1st, brigade, had, conquered, all, its, assigned, territories, by, 12, july, the, 2nd, brigade, had, captured, gakem, ogudu, and, ogoja, to, assist, nigeria, egypt, sent, six, ilyushin, il, 28, bombers, flown, by, egyptian, air, crews, the, habit, of, the, egyptians, to, bomb, red, cross, hospitals, together, with, schools, hospitals, and, marketplaces, did, much, to, earn, biafra, international, sympathy, enugu, became, the, hub, of, secession, and, rebellion, and, the, nigerian, government, believed, that, once, enugu, was, captured, the, drive, for, secession, would, end, the, plans, to, conquer, enugu, began, on, 12, september, 1967, on, 4, october, the, nigerian, 1st, division, captured, enugu, ojukwu, was, asleep, in, the, biafran, state, house, when, the, federal, troops, attacked, and, narrowly, escaped, by, disguising, himself, as, a, servant, many, nigerians, hoped, that, enugu, s, capture, would, convince, the, igbos, traditional, elite, to, end, their, support, for, secession, even, if, ojukwu, did, not, follow, them, this, did, not, occur, ojukwu, relocated, his, government, without, difficulty, to, umuahia, a, city, positioned, deep, within, traditional, igbo, territory, the, fall, of, enugu, contributed, to, a, brief, destabilisation, of, biafran, propaganda, efforts, as, the, forced, relocation, of, personnel, left, the, ministry, of, information, disorganised, and, the, federal, force, s, success, undermined, previous, biafran, assertions, that, the, nigerian, state, could, not, withstand, a, protracted, war, on, 23, october, the, biafran, official, radio, declared, in, a, broadcast, that, ojukwu, promised, to, continue, resisting, the, federal, government, and, that, he, attributed, the, loss, of, enugu, to, subversive, actions, nigerian, soldiers, under, murtala, mohammed, carried, out, a, mass, killing, of, 700, civilians, when, they, captured, asaba, on, the, river, niger, the, nigerians, were, repulsed, three, times, as, they, attempted, to, cross, the, river, niger, during, october, resulting, in, the, loss, of, thousands, of, troops, dozens, of, tanks, and, equipment, the, first, attempt, by, the, 2nd, infantry, division, on, 12, october, to, cross, the, niger, from, the, town, of, asaba, to, the,

came, under, immediate, fire, by, federal, troops, by, 20, october, garrison, s, forces, withdrew, from, the, battle, while, col, ogi, officially, surrendered, to, gen, adekunle, on, 19, may, 1968, port, harcourt, was, captured, with, the, capture, of, enugu, bonny, calabar, and, port, harcourt, the, outside, world, was, left, in, no, doubt, of, the, federal, supremacy, in, the, war, biafran, propaganda, always, blamed, military, defeats, on, saboteurs, within, the, ranks, of, the, biafran, officer, and, both, officers, and, the, other, ranks, were, encouraged, to, denounce, suspected, saboteurs, throughout, the, war, biafran, officers, were, far, more, likely, to, be, executed, by, their, own, side, than, by, the, federal, army, as, ojukwu, conducted, purges, and, had, officers, who, were, merely, accused, of, being, saboteurs, taken, out, and, shot, ojukwu, did, not, trust, the, majority, of, the, former, federal, igbo, officers, who, had, rallied, to, biafra, and, saw, them, as, potential, rivals, thus, leading, to, murderous, purges, that, led, to, most, of, them, being, executed, furthermore, ojukwu, needed, scapegoats, for, biafra, s, defeats, and, death, was, the, usual, punishment, for, biafran, officers, who, lost, a, battle, out, of, a, fear, of, a, coup, ojukwu, created, several, units, such, as, the, s, brigade, commanded, by, himself, and, the, 4th, commando, brigade, commanded, by, the, german, mercenary, rolf, steiner, that, existed, outside, of, the, regular, chain, of, command, barua, wrote, that, ojukwu, s, leadership, especially, his, frequent, executions, of, his, own, officers, had, a, disastrous, impact, on, the, morale, of, the, biafran, officer, corps, the, executions, of, officers, also, made, it, difficult, for, the, biafran, officers, to, acquire, the, necessary, experience, to, conduct, military, operations, successfully, as, barua, noted, the, biafran, army, lacked, both, the, continuity, and, cohesion, to, learn, from, the, war, oil, exploration, in, nigeria, was, pioneered, by, the, shell, bp, petroleum, development, company, in, 1937, in, a, bid, to, control, the, oil, in, the, eastern, region, the, federal, government, placed, a, shipping, embargo, on, the, territory, this, embargo, did, not, include, oil, tankers, the, leadership, of, biafra, wrote, to, shell, bp, demanding, royalties, for, the, oil, that, was, being, explored, in, their, region, after, much, deliberation, shell, bp, decided, to, pay, biafra, the, sum, of, 250, 000, pounds, the, news, of, this, payment, reached, the, federal, government, which, immediately, extended, the, shipping, embargo, to, oil, tankers, the, nigerian, government, also, made, it, clear, to, shell, bp, that, it, expected, the, company, to, pay, all, outstanding, oil, royalties, immediately, with, the, stalling, on, the, payment, for, biafra, the, government, instructed, shell, bp, to, stop, operations, in, biafra, and, took, over, from, the, company, towards, the, end, of, july, 1967, nigerian, federal, troops, and, marines, captured, bonny, island, in, the, niger, delta, thereby, taking, control, of, vital, shell, bp, facilities, operations, began, again, in, may, 1968, when, nigeria, captured, port, harcourt, its, facilities, had, been, damaged, and, needed, repair, oil, production, and, export, continued, but, at, a, lower, level, the, completion, in, 1969, of, a, new, terminal, at, for, ados, brought, production, up, from, 142, 000, barrels, day, in, 1958, to, 540, 000, barrels, day, in, 1969, in, 1970, this, figure, doubled, to, 1, 08, million, barrels, day, the, royalties, enabled, nigeria, to, buy, more, weapons, hire, mercenaries, etc, biafra, proved, unable, to, compete, on, this, economic, level, the, united, kingdom, had, planned, to, maintain, and, expand, its, supply, of, cheap, high, quality, oil, from, nigeria, therefore, it, placed, a, high, priority, on, maintenance, of, oil, extraction, and, refining, operations, the, war, broke, out, just, a, week, before, the, six, day, war, in, the, middle, east, forcing, oil, tankers, from, the, middle, east, to, use, the, long, route, around, the, cape, of, good, hope, thereby, increasing, the, cost, of, middle, eastern, oil, in, turn, this, increased, the, importance, of, nigerian, oil, to, the, united, kingdom, because, nigerian, oil, was, cheaper, than, persian, gulf, oil, initially, when, it, was, unclear, which, side, would, prevail, the, united, kingdom, took, a, wait, and, see, approach, before, opting, decisively, for, nigeria, nigeria, had, a, navy, of, only, six, vessels, the, largest, of, which, was, a, frigate, an, air, force, of, 76, planes, none, of, which, were, fighters, or, bombers, and, an, army, of, 7, 000, men, with, no, tanks, and, a, shortage, of, officers, with, command, experience, though, biafra, was, likewise, similarly, weak, the, two, sides, appeared, evenly, matched, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, and, nigerian, victory, was, by, no, means, considered, preordained, the, united, kingdom, backed, the, federal, government, but, when, the, war, broke, out, cautioned, them, not, to, damage, british, oil, installations, in, the, east, these, oilworks, under, the, control, of, the, shell, bp, petroleum, development, company, jointly, owned, by, shell, and, british, petroleum, controlled, 84, per, cent, of, nigeria, s, 580, 000, barrels, per, day, two, thirds, of, this, oil, came, from, the, eastern, region, and, another, third, from, the, newly, created, mid, west, region, two, fifths, of, all, nigerian, oil, ended, up, in, the, united, kingdom, in, 1967, 30, per, cent, of, the, oil, being, imported, into, the, united, kingdom, came, from, nigeria, shell, bp, therefore, considered, carefully, a, request, by, the, federal, government, that, it, refuse, to, pay, the, royalties, demanded, by, biafra, its, lawyers, advised, that, payment, to, biafra, would, be, appropriate, if, this, government, did, in, fact, maintain, law, and, order, in, the, region, in, question, the, british, government, advised, that, paying, biafra, could, undermine, the, goodwill, of, the, federal, government, shell, bp, made, the, payment, and, the, government, established, a, blockade, on, oil, exports, forced, to, choose, a, side, shell, bp, and, the, british, government, threw, in, their, lot, with, the, federal, government, in, lagos, apparently, calculating, that, this, side, would, be, more, likely, to, win, the, war, as, the, british, high, commissioner, in, lagos, wrote, to, the, secretary, of, state, for, commonwealth, affairs, on, 27, july, 1967, ojukwu, even, victorious, will, not, be, in, a, strong, position, he, will, require, all, the, international, help, and, recognition, he, can, get, the, federal, government, would, be, much, better, placed, both, internationally, and, internally, they, would, have, a, cast, iron, case, for, the, severest, treatment, of, a, company, which, has, subsidised, a, rebel, and, i, feel, fairly, convinced, they, would, press, their, case, to, the, lengths, of, cancelling, the, company, s, concessions, and, nationalising, their, installations, i, conclude, therefore, if, the, company, does, change, its, mind, and, asks, the, british, government, for, advice, the, best, that, could, be, given, is, for, it, to, clamber, hastily, back, on, the, lagos, side, of, the, fence, with, cheque, book, at, the, ready, shell, bp, took, this, advice, it, continued, to, quietly, support, nigeria, through, the, rest, of, the, war, in, one, case, advancing, a, royalty, of, 5, 5, million, to, fund, the, purchase, of, more, british, weapons, it, was, not, until, federal, forces, captured, the, ocean, oil, terminal, at, bonny, on, 25, july, 1967, that, the, british, prime, minister, harold, wilson, decided, to, back, nigeria, with, military, aid, after, the, federal, victory, at, bonny, wilson, summoned, david, hunt, the, british, high, commissioner, to, nigeria, for, a, meeting, at, 10, downing, street, in, early, august, 1967, for, his, assessment, of, the, situation, hunt, s, view, that, the, federal, forces, were, the, better, organised, and, would, win, because, they, could, draw, upon, a, greater, population, led, wilson, to, side, with, nigeria, during, the, war, the, united, kingdom, covertly, supplied, nigeria, with, weapons, and, military, intelligence, and, may, have, also, helped, it, to, hire, mercenaries, after, the, decision, was, made, to, back, nigeria, the, bbc, oriented, its, reporting, to, favour, this, side, supplies, provided, to, the, federal, military, government, included, two, vessels, and, 60, vehicles, in, the, united, kingdom, the,

large, sums, of, money, at, their, disposal, france, provided, weapons, mercenary, fighters, and, other, assistance, to, biafra, and, promoted, its, cause, internationally, describing, the, situation, as, a, genocide, president, charles, de, gaulle, referred, to, biafra, s, just, and, noble, cause, however, france, did, not, recognise, biafra, diplomatically, through, pierre, laureys, france, had, apparently, provided, two, b, 26s, alouette, helicopters, and, pilots, france, supplied, biafra, with, captured, german, and, italian, weapons, from, world, war, ii, sans, serial, numbers, delivered, as, part, of, regular, shipments, to, ivory, coast, france, also, sold, panhard, armoured, vehicles, to, the, nigerian, federal, government, french, involvement, in, the, war, can, be, viewed, in, the, context, of, its, geopolitical, strategy, fran, afrique, and, competition, with, the, british, in, west, africa, nigeria, represented, a, base, of, british, influence, in, the, predominantly, french, aligned, area, france, and, portugal, used, nearby, countries, in, their, sphere, of, influence, especially, ivory, coast, under, president, f, lix, houphou, t, boigny, as, waystations, for,

france, ojukwu, suggested, on, 10, august, 1967, that, biafra, introduce, compulsory, french, classes, in, secondary, technical, and, teacher, training, schools, in, order, to, benefit, from, the, rich, culture, of, the, french, speaking, world, france, led, the, way, internationally, for, political, support, of, biafra, portugal, also, sent, weapons, these, transactions, were, arranged,

resumed, support, for, biafra, including, cooperation, with, the, south, african, secret, service, to, import, more, weapons, the, soviet, union, strongly, backed, the, nigerian, government, emphasising, the, similarity, with, the, congo, situation, nigeria, s, need, for, more, aircraft, which, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, refused, to, sell, led, gowon, to, accept, a, soviet, offer, in, the, summer, of, 1967, to, sell, a, squadron, of, 17, mig, 17, fighters, the, british, trained, nigerian, military, tended, to, be, distrustful, of, the, soviet, union, but, the, soviet, ambassador, in, lagos, alexander, romanov, a, gregarious, and, friendly, man, as, well, as, a, shrewd, diplomat, established, an, excellent, rapport, with, gowon, and, persuaded, him, that, accepting, soviet, weapons, would, not, mean, subjection, to, the, soviet, union, the, first, mig, 17s, arrived, in, nigeria, in, august, 1967, together, with, some, about, 200, soviet, technicians, to, train, the, nigerians, in, their, use, though, the, mig, 17s, turned, out, to, be, too, sophisticated, for, the, nigerians, to, use, properly, requiring, egyptian, air, force, pilots, to, fly, them, the, soviet, nigerian, arms, deal, turned, out, to, be, one, of, the, turning, points, of, the, war, besides, establishing, an, arms, pipeline, from, the, soviet, union, to, nigeria, the, possibility, that, the, soviet, union, would, gain, greater, influence, in, nigeria, led, the, united, kingdom, to, increase, its, supply, of, arms, to, maintain, its, influence, in, lagos, while, ruling, out, the, possibility, of, either, the, united, states, or, britain, recognising, biafra, the, soviet, union, consistently, supplied, nigeria, with, weapons, with, the, diplomatic, disclaimer, that, these, were, strictly, for, cash, on, a, commercial, basis, in, 1968, the, ussr, agreed, to, finance, the, kainji, dam, on, the, niger, somewhat, upriver, from, the, delta, soviet, media, outlets, initially, accused, the, british, of, cynically, supporting, the, biafran, secession, then, had, to, adjust, these, claims, later, when, it, turned, out, that, the, united, kingdom, was, in, fact, supporting, the, federal, government, one, explanation, for, soviet, sympathy, with, the, federal, military, government, was, a, shared, opposition, to, internal, secessionist, movements, before, the, war, the, soviets, had, seemed, sympathetic, to, the, igbos, but, soviet, prime, minister, alexei, kosygin, stated, to, their, chagrin, in, october, 1967, that, the, soviet, people, fully, understand, nigeria, s, motives, and, its, need, to, prevent, the, country, from, being, dismembered, reportedly, the, war, substantially, improved, soviet, nigerian, diplomatic, and, trade, relations, and, moskvitch, cars, began, to, make, appearances, around, lagos, the, ussr, became, a, competitive, importer, of, nigerian, cacao, because, the, soviet, union, was, one, of, nigeria, s,

first, major, statement, on, the, war, in, september, 1968, the, xinhua, press, agency, stated, the, people, s, republic, of, china, fully, supported, the, justified, struggle, for, liberation, of, the, people, of, biafra, against, the, nigerian, government, supported, by, anglo, american, imperialism, and, soviet, revisionism, china, supported, arms, to, biafra, via, tanzania, supplying, arms, worth, some, 2, million, in, 1968, 1969, from, early, on, israel, perceived, that, nigeria, would, be, an, important, player, in, west, african, politics, and, saw, good, relations, with, lagos, as, an, important, foreign, policy, objective, nigeria, and, israel, established, a, linkage, in, 1957, in, 1960, the, united, kingdom, allowed, the, creation, of, an, israeli, diplomatic, mission, in, lagos, and, israel, made, a, 10, million, loan, to, the, nigerian, government, israel, also, developed, a, cultural, relation, with, the, igbos, based, on, possible, shared, traditions, these, moves, represented, a, significant, diplomatic, success, given, the, muslim, orientation, of, the, northern, dominated, government, some, northern, leaders, disapproved, of, contact, with, israel, and, banned, israelis, from, maiduguri, and, sokoto, israel, did, not, begin, arms, sales, to, nigeria, until, after, aguyi, ironsi, came, to, power, on, 17, january, 1966, this, was, considered, an, opportune, time, to, develop, this, relationship, with, the, federal, government, ram, nirgad, became, israeli, ambassador, to, nigeria, in, january, thirty, tons, of, mortar, rounds, were, delivered, in, april, the, eastern, region, began, seeking, assistance, from, israel, in, september, 1966, israel, apparently, turned, down, their, requests, repeatedly, although, they, may, have, put, the, biafran, representatives, in, contact, with, another, arms, dealer, in, 1968, israel, began, supplying, the, federal, military, government, with, arms, about, 500, 000, worth, according, to, the, us, state, department, meanwhile, as, elsewhere, the, situation, in, biafra, became, publicised, as, a, genocide, the, knesset, publicly, debated, this, issue, on, 17, and, 22, july, 1968, winning, applause, from, the, press, for, its, sensitivity, right, wing, and, left, wing, political, groups, and, student, activists, spoke, for, biafra, in, august, 1968, the, israeli, air, force, overtly, sent, twelve, tons, of, food, aid, to, a, nearby, site, outside, of, nigerian, biafran, airspace, covertly, mossad, provided, biafra, with, 100, 000, through, zurich, and, attempted, an, arms, shipment, soon, after, israel, arranged, to, make, clandestine, weapons, shipments, to, biafra, using, ivory, coast, transport, planes, the, nations, of, sub, saharan, africa, tended, to, support, the, arabs, in, the, israeli, palestinian, dispute, by, voting, for, resolutions, sponsored, by, arab, states, at, the, united, nations, a, major, goal, of, israeli, diplomacy, was, to, wean, the, african, states, away, from, the, arab, states, and, given, the, way, that, the, majority, of, african, nations, supported, nigeria, israel, was, loath, to, antagonise, them, by, supporting, biafra, too, overtly, president, gamal, abdel, nasser, dispatched, pilots, of, the, egyptian, air, force, to, fight, for, nigeria, in, august, 1967, flying, the, recently, arrived, mig, 17s, the, tendency, of, egyptian, pilots, to, indiscriminately, bomb, biafran, civilians, proved, counterproductive, in, the, propaganda, war, as, the, biafrans, did, their, best, to, publicise, cases, of, civilians, killed, by, the, egyptians, in, the, spring, of, 1969, the, nigerians, replaced, the, egyptian, pilots, with, european, pilots, who, proved, to, be, considerably, more, competent, the, civil, war, began, while, the, united, states, was, under, the, presidency, of, lyndon, b, johnson, who, was, officially, neutral, in, regard, to, the, civil, war, with, u, s, secretary, of, state, dean, rusk, stating, that, america, is, not, in, a, position, to, take, action, as, nigeria, is, an, area, under, british, influence, strategically, u, s, interests, aligned, with, the, federal, military, government, although, there, was, considerable, popular, public, sentiment, in, support, of, biafra, the, u, s, also, saw, value, in, its, alliance, with, lagos, and, sought, to, protect, 800, million, in, the, assessment, of, the, state, department, worth, of, private, investment, the, neutrality, was, not, universally, popular, and, a, pro, biafra, lobby, emerged, within, the, united, states, to, pressure, the, u, s, government, to, take, a, more, active, role, in, assisting, biafra, the, american, committee, to, keep, biafra, alive, was, an, organization, founded, by, american, activists, to, inform, the, american, public, of, the, war, and, sway, popular, opinion, towards, biafra, biafra, became, a, topic, in, the, 1968, united, states, presidential, election, and, on, 9, september, 1968, future, republican, president, richard, nixon, called, for, lyndon, b, johnson, to, take, action, in, helping, biafra, stating, until, now, efforts, to, relieve, the, biafran, people, have, been, thwarted, by, the, desire, of, central, government, of, nigeria, to, pursue, total, and, unconditional, victory, and, by, the, fear, of, the, ibo, people, that, surrender, means, wholesale, atrocities, and, genocide, but, genocide, is, what, is, taking, place, right, now, and, starvation, is, the, grim, reaper, both, biafran, officials, and, the, u, s, pro, biafra, lobby, hoped, the, election, of, richard, nixon, would, change, u, s, foreign, policy, regarding, the, war, however, when, nixon, became, president, in, 1969, he, found, there, was, little, he, could, do, to, change, the, established, stance, aside, from, calling, for, another, round, of, peace, talks, according, to, american, political, theorist, ernest, w, lefever, the, u, s, providing, official, support, to, biafra, would, have, resulted, in, hostility, from, not, only, nigeria, but, also, other, african, nations, who, supported, nigeria, in, the, war, who, had, successfully, argued, to, the, united, nations, that, the, war, was, an, internal, affair, that, the, u, n, should, not, be, involved, with, the, vietnam, war, served, as, another, obstacle, to, a, possible, u, s, intervention, in, biafra, despite, this, nixon, continued, to, personally, support, biafra, himself, a, jew, who, escaped, persecution, from, nazi, germany, u, s, secretary, of, state, henry, kissinger, compared, the, igbo, people, to, jews, in, a, memoriam, written, to, u, s, president, richard, nixon, stating, the, ibos, are, the, wandering, jews, of, west, africa, gifted, aggressive, westernized, at, best,

until, february, 1970, biafra, appealed, unsuccessfully, for, support, from, the, organisation, of, african, unity, oau, the, precursor, to, the, african, union, the, oau, bound, by, its, charter, to, oppose, any, secession, from, a, member, state, denounced, biafra, s, attempt, to, secede, from, nigeria, equally, bound, by, its, charter, to, refrain, from, interference, in, the, internal, affairs, of, its, member, states, the, oau, took, no, further, action, countries, such, as, ethiopia, and, egypt, vocally, supported, the, nigerian, government, s, policies, in, order, to, prevent, inspiring, revolts, within, their, own, borders, however, biafra, received, the, support, of, african, countries, such, as, tanzania, zambia, gabon, and, ivory, coast, rhodesian, pilots, smuggled, weapons, and, money, into, biafra, which, rhodesian, intelligence, chief, ken, flower, claimed, was, part, of, the, operations, of, rhodesia, s, central, intelligence, organisation, outmatched, by, nigeria, s,

it, was, hoped, that, employing, mercenaries, in, nigeria, would, have, impact, similar, to, that, experienced, in, the, congo, but, the, mercenaries, proved, largely, ineffective, since, the, nigerian, military, received, much, more, professional, and, adequate, training, compared, to, the, congolese, militias, despite, some, initial, successes, such, as, operation, oau, over, half, of, the, 4th, commando, brigade, was, wiped, out, by, nigerian, forces, during, the, disastrous, operation, hiroshima, of, 15, 29, november, 1968, resulting, in, steiner, experiencing, depression, and, a, nervous, breakdown, leading, to, his, eventual, expulsion, and, replacement, by, taffy, williams, although, nigeria, appeared, to, be, a, tougher, opponent, commentators, observing, the, war, noted, that, the, remaining, mercenaries, appeared, to, have, developed, a, personal, or, ideological, commitment, to, biafra, s, cause, which, is, a, rare, trait, for, mercenaries, belgian, mercenary, marc, goosens, who, was, killed, by, defensive, nigerian, forces, in, a, suicide, mission, during, operation, hiroshima, was, reportedly, motivated, to, return, to, africa, after, a, dispute, with, his, girlfriend, goosens, was, photographed, in, the, moments, before, and, after, his, death, steiner, claimed, to, have, fought, for, biafra, for, idealistic, reasons, saying, the, igbo, people, were, the, victims, of, genocide, but, the, american, journalist, ted, morgan, mocked, his, claims, describing, steiner, as, a, militarist, who, simply, craved, war, because, killing, was, the, only, thing, he, knew, how, to, do, well, journalist, frederick, forsyth, quotes, taffy, williams, speaking, highly, of, his, biafran, subordinates, i, ve, seen, a, lot, of, africans, at, war, but, there, s, nobody, to, touch, these, people, give, me, 10, 000, biafrans, for, six, months, and, we, ll, build, an, army, that, would, be, invincible, on, this, continent, i, ve, seen, men, die, in, this, war, who, would, have, won, the, victoria, cross, in, another, context, after, the, war, philip, effiong, the, chief, of, the, biafran, general, staff, was, asked, by, a, journalist, about, the, impact, of, the, mercenaries, on, the, war, his, reply, was, they, had, not, helped, it, would, had, made, no, difference, if, not, a, single, one, of, them, came, to, work, for, the, secessionist, forces, rolf, steiner, stayed, the, longest, he, was, more, of, a, bad, influence, than, anything, else, we, were, happy, to, get, rid, of, him, from, 1968, onward, the, war, fell, into, a, form, of, stalemate, with, nigerian, forces, unable, to, make, significant, advances, into, the, remaining, areas, under, biafran, control, due, to, stiff, resistance, and, major, defeats, in, abagana, arochukwu, oguta, umuahia, operation, oau, onne, ikot, ekpene, etc, but, another, nigerian, offensive, from, april, to, june, 1968, began, to, close, the, ring, around, the, biafrans, with, further, advances, on, the, two, northern, fronts, and, the, capture, of, port, harcourt, on, 19, may, 1968, the, blockade, of, the, surrounded, biafrans, led, to, a, humanitarian, disaster, when, it, emerged, that, there, was, widespread, civilian, hunger, and, starvation, in, the, besieged, igbo, areas, the, biafran, government, reported, that, nigeria, was, using, hunger, and, genocide, to, win, the, war, and, sought, aid, from, the, outside, world, private, groups, in, the, us, led, by, senator, ted, kennedy, responded, no, one, was, ever, held, responsible, for, these, killings, in, september, 1968, the, federal, army, planned, what, gowon, described, as, the, final, offensive, initially, the, final, offensive, was, neutralised, by, biafran, troops, by, the, end, of, the, year, after, several, nigerian, troops, were, routed, in, biafran, ambushes, in, the, latter, stages, a, southern, federal, military, government, offensive, managed, to, break, through, however, in, 1969, the, biafrans, launched, several, offensives, against, the, nigerians, in, their, attempts, to, keep, the, nigerians, off, balance, starting, in, march, when, the, 14th, division, of, the, biafran, army, recaptured, owerri, and, moved, towards, port, harcourt, but, were, halted, just, north, of, the, city, in, may, 1969, biafran, commandos, recaptured, oil, wells, in, kwale, in, july, 1969, biafran, forces, launched, a, major, land, offensive, supported, by, foreign, mercenary, pilots, continuing, to, fly, in, food, medical, supplies, and, weapons, most, notable, of, the, mercenaries, was, swedish, count, carl, gustav, von, rosen, who, led, air, attacks, with, five, malm, mfi, 9, minicoin, small, piston, engined, aircraft, armed, with, rocket, pods, and, machine, guns, his, biafran, air, force, consisted, of, three, swedes, von, rosen, gunnar, haglund, and, martin, lang, the, other, two, pilots, were, biafrans, willy, murray, bruce, and, augustus, opke, from, 22, may, to, 8, july, 1969, von, rosen, s, small, force, attacked, nigerian, military, airfields, in, port, harcourt, enugu, benin, city, and, ughelli, destroying, or, damaging, a, number, of, nigerian, air, force, jets, used, to, attack, relief, flights, including, a, few, mig, 17, s, and, three, of, nigeria, s, six, ilyushin, il, 28, bombers, that, were, used, to, bomb, biafran, villages, and, farms, on, a, daily, basis, although, the, biafran, offensives, of, 1969, were, a, tactical, success, the, nigerians, soon, recovered, the, biafran, air, attacks, did, disrupt, the, combat, operations, of, the, nigerian, air, force, but, only, for, a, few, months, in, response, to, the, nigerian, government, using, foreigners, to, lead, some, advances, the, biafran, government, also, began, hiring, foreign, mercenaries, to, extend, the, war, only, german, born, rolf, steiner, a, lieutenant, colonel, with, the, 4th, commandos, and, major, taffy, williams, a, welshman, would, remain, for, the, duration, nigeria, deployed, foreign, aircraft, in, the, form, of, soviet, mig, 17, and, il, 28, bombers, the, september, massacres, and, subsequent, igbo, withdrawal, from, northern, nigeria, was, the, basis, for, the, initial, human, rights, petition, to, the, un, to, end, genocide, and, provided, a, historical, link, to, biafran, claims, of, genocide, during, the, nigerian, civil, war, awareness, of, a, mounting, crisis, rose, in, 1968, information, spread, especially, through, religious, networks, beginning, with, alerts, from, missionaries, it, did, not, escape, the, notice, of, worldwide, christian, organisations, that, the, biafrans, were, christian, and, the, northern, nigerians, controlling, the, federal, government, were, muslim, among, these, christian, efforts, were, the, organisation, joint, church, aid, and, caritas, the, latter, aligned, with, various, international, catholic, aid, groups, the, famine, was, a, result, of, the, blockade, that, the, nigerian, government, had, imposed, on, the, eastern, region, in, the, months, leading, up, to, secession, frederick, forsyth, then, a, journalist, in, nigeria, and, later, a, successful, novelist, observed, that, the, main, problem, was, kwashiorkor, a, protein, deficiency, prior, to, the, civil, war, the, main, source, of, dietary, protein, was, dried, fish, imported, from, norway, which, was, supplemented, by, local, hogs, chicken, and, eggs, the, blockade, prevented, imports, and, local, protein, supplies, were, quickly, depleted, the, national, diet, was, now, almost, 100, starch, many, volunteer, bodies, organised, the, biafran, airlift, which, provided, blockade, breaking, relief, flights, into, biafra, carrying, food, medicines, and, sometimes, according, to, some, claims, weapons, more, common, was, the, claim, that, the, arms, carrying, aircraft, would, closely, shadow, aid, aircraft, making, it, more, difficult, to, distinguish, between, aid, aircraft, and, military, supply, aircraft, the, american, community, to, keep, biafra, alive, stood, apart, from, other, organisations, by, quickly, creating, a, broad, strategy, for, pressuring, the, american, government, into, taking, a, more, active, role, in, facilitating, relief, former, peace, corps, volunteers, who, had, recently, returned, from, nigeria, and, college, students, founded, the, american, committee, in, july, 1968, the, peace, corps, volunteers, stationed, in, the, eastern, region, developed, strong, friendships, and, identified, as, igbo, which, prompted, them, to, help, the, eastern, region, one, of, the, characters, assisting, count, carl, gustav, von, rosen, was, lynn, garrison, an, ex, rcaf, fighter, pilot, he, introduced, the, count, to, a, canadian, method, of, dropping, bagged, supplies, to, remote, areas, in, canada, without, losing, the, contents, he, showed, how, one, sack, of, food, could, be, placed, inside, a, larger, sack, before, the, supply, drop, when, the, package, hit, the, ground, the, inner, sack, would, rupture, while, the, outer, one, kept, the, contents, intact, with, this, method, many, tons, of, food, were, dropped, to, many, biafrans, who, would, otherwise, have, died, of, starvation, bernard, kouchner, was, one, of, a, number, of, french, doctors, who, volunteered, with, the, french, red, cross, to, work, in, hospitals, and, feeding, centres, in, besieged, biafra, the, red, cross, required, volunteers, to, sign, an, agreement, which, was, seen, by, some, like, kouchner, and, his, supporters, as, being, similar, to, a, gag, order, that, was, designed, to, maintain, the, organisation, s, neutrality, whatever, the, circumstances, kouchner, and, the, other, french, doctors, signed, this, agreement, after, entering, the, country, the, volunteers, in, addition, to, biafran, health, workers, and, hospitals, were, subjected, to, attacks, by, the, nigerian, army, and, witnessed, civilians, being, murdered, and, starved, by, the, blockading, forces, kouchner, also, witnessed, these, events, particularly, the, huge, number, of, starving, children, and, when, he, returned, to, france, he, publicly, criticised, the, nigerian, government, and, the, red, cross, for, their, seemingly, complicit, behaviour, with, the, help, of, other, french, doctors, kouchner, put, biafra, in, the, media, spotlight, and, called, for, an, international, response, to, the, situation, these, doctors, led, by, kouchner, concluded, that, a, new, aid, organisation, was, needed, that, would, ignore, political, religious, boundaries, and, prioritise, the, welfare, of, victims, they, formed, the, comit, de, lutte, contre, le, g, nocide, au, biafra, which, in, 1971, became, m, decins, sans, fronti, res, doctors, without, borders, the, crisis, brought, about, a, large, increase, in, prominence, and, funding, of, non, governmental, organisations, ngos, media, and, public, relations, played, a, central, role, in, the, war, due, to, their, influence, on, morale, at, home, and, the, dynamics, of, international, involvement, both, sides, relied, heavily, on, external, support, biafra, hired, the, new, york, public, relations, firm, of, ruder, and, finn, to, lobby, american, public, opinion, however, it, was, not, until, biafra, hired, the, geneva, public, relations, markpress, in, january, 1968, that, significant, international, sympathy, was, won, markpress, was, headed, by, an, american, public, relations, executive, william, bernhardt, who, was, paid, 12, 000, swiss, francs, per, month, for, his, services, and, who, expected, a, share, of, biafra, s, oil, revenues, after, the, war, markpress, s, portrayal, of, the, war, as, a, struggle, for, freedom, by, the, catholic, igbos, against, the, muslim, dominated, north, won, the, support, of, catholic, opinion, all, over, the, world, especially, in, the, united, states, besides, portraying, the, war, as, a, christian, muslim, conflict, markpress, accused, the, federal, government, of, waging, genocide, against, the, igbos, a, campaign, that, was, extremely, effective, as, pictures, of, starving, igbos, won, the, sympathy, of, the, world, media, campaigns, focused, on, the, plight, of, the, biafrans, intensified, internationally, in, the, summer, of, 1968, by, the, biafran, leadership, and, then, around, the, world, the, pogroms, and, famine, were, classified, as, genocide, and, compared, to, the, holocaust, hypothetical, judaic, origins, of, the, igbos, were, used, to, bolster, comparisons, with, jews, in, germany, in, the, international, press, igbo, refugee, camps, were, compared, to, nazi, extermination, camps, humanitarian, appeals, differed, somewhat, from, place, to, place, in, the, united, kingdom, humanitarian, aid, used, familiar, discourses, of, imperial, responsibility, in, ireland, advertisements, appealed, to, shared, catholicism, and, experiences, of, civil, war, both, of, these, appeals, channelled, older, cultural, values, into, support, for, the, new, model, of, international, ngos, in, ireland, public, opinion, identified, intensely, with, biafra, as, most, of, the, catholic, priests, working, in, biafra, were, irish, who, naturally, sympathised, with, the, biafrans, who, they, saw, as, fellow, catholics, struggling, for, independence, the, irish, journalist, john, hogan, who, covered, the, war, noted, the, threat, of, famine, combined, with, an, independence, struggle, had, an, almost, irresistible, political, and, emotional, impact, on, irish, public, opinion, which, became, hugely, supportive, of, the, regular, airlifts, via, the, off, shore, portuguese, island, of, s, o, tom, of, food, and, medical, supplies, to, the, beleaguered, infant, republic, the, use, of, famine, as, a, conscious, tactic, by, the, federal, government, who, wanted, to, starve, biafra, into, submission, provoked, parallels, with, the, great, famine, of, ireland, of, the, 1840s, while, many, irish, people, saw, a, parallel, with, igbo, struggle, for, independence, with, their, own, independence, struggle, the, pro, biafra, british, journalist, frederick, forsyth, started, covering, the, war, in, the, summer, of, 1967, for, the, bbc, became, angry, at, the, pro, nigeria, stance, of, the, british, government, and, resigned, in, protest, in, september, 1967, returning, as, a, freelance, journalist, in, 1968, forysth, worked, closely, with, the, irish, holy, ghost, fathers, to, collect, information, about, the, famine, and, whose, dispatches, from, biafra, had, an, immense, impact, on, british, public, opinion, in, israel, the, holocaust, comparison, was, promoted, as, was, the, theme, of, threat, from, hostile, muslim, neighbours, the, biafran, war, presented, westerners, with, the, notion, of, starving, african, children, the, biafran, famine, was, one, of, the, first, african, disasters, to, receive, widespread, media, coverage, enabled, by, the, proliferation, of, television, sets, the, televised, disaster, and, the, rising, ngos, mutually, enhanced, each, other, ngos, maintained, their, own, communications, networks, and, played, a, significant, role, in, shaping, news, coverage, biafran, elites, studied, western, propaganda, techniques, and, released, carefully, constructed, public, communications, in, an, intentional, fashion, biafran, propagandists, had, the, dual, task, of, appealing, to, international, public, opinion, and, maintaining, morale, and, nationalist, spirit, domestically, political, cartoons, were, a, preferred, medium, for, publicising, simple, interpretations, of, the, war, biafra, also, used, push, polling, to, insinuate, messages, about, nigeria, s, inherent, bloodthirstiness, novelist, chinua, achebe, became, a, committed, propagandist, for, biafra, and, one, of, its, leading, international, advocates, on, 29, may, 1969, bruce, mayrock, a, student, at, columbia, university, set, himself, ablaze, at, the, premises, of, the, united, nations, headquarters, in, new, york, to, protest, what, he, viewed, as, a, genocide, against, the, people, of, biafra, he, died, of, his, injuries, the, following, day, on, 25, november, 1969, musician, john, lennon, returned, the, mbe, he, had, awarded, by, queen, elizabeth, ii, in, 1964, in, protest, against, british, support, for, nigeria, in, his, letter, to, the,

expatriate, personnel, the, captives, included, 14, italians, 3, west, germans, and, one, lebanese, it, was, claimed, that, the, foreigners, were, captured, fighting, alongside, nigerians, against, biafran, troops, and, that, they, assisted, nigerians, in, constructing, roads, to, aid, them, in, their, operations, against, biafra, they, were, tried, by, a, biafran, court, and, sentenced, to, death, this, incident, caused, an, international, uproar, in, the, month, that, followed, pope, paul, vi, the, governments, of, italy, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, of, america, mounted, concerted, pressure, on, biafra, on, 4, june, 1969, after, receiving, a, personal, direct, mail, from, the, pope, ojukwu, pardoned, the, foreigners, they, were, released, to, the, special, envoys, sent, by, the, governments, of, ivory, coast, and, gabon, and, left, biafra, with, increased, british, support, the, nigerian, federal, forces, launched, their, final, offensive, against, the, biafrans, once, again, on, 23, december, 1969, with, a, major, thrust, by, the, 3rd, marine, commando, division, the, division, was, commanded, by, col, olusegun, obasanjo, who, later, became, president, twice, which, succeeded, in, splitting, the, biafran, enclave, into, two, by, the, end, of, the, year, the, final, nigerian, offensive, named, operation, tail, wind, was, launched, on, 7, january, 1970, with, the, 3rd, marine, commando, division, attacking, and, supported, by, the, 1st, infantry, division, to, the, north, and, the, 2nd, infantry, division, to, the, south, the, biafran, towns, of, owerri, fell, on, 9, january, and, uli, on, 11, january, only, a, few, days, earlier, ojukwu, fled, into, exile, by, plane, to, the, ivory, coast, leaving, his, deputy, philip, effiong, to, handle, the, details, of, the, surrender, to, general, yakubu, gowon, of, the, federal, army, on, 13, january, 1970, the, surrender, paper, was, signed, on, 14, january, 1970, in, lagos, and, thus, came, the, end, of, the, civil, war, and, renunciation, of, secession, fighting, ended, a, few, days, later, with, the, nigerian, forces, advancing, into, the, remaining, biafran, held, territories, which, was, met, with, little, resistance, after, the, war, gowon, said, the, tragic, chapter, of, violence, is, just, ended, we, are, at, the, dawn, of, national, reconciliation, once, again, we, have, an, opportunity, to, build, a, new, nation, my, dear, compatriots, we, must, pay, homage, to, the, fallen, to, the, heroes, who, have, made, the, supreme, sacrifice, that, we, may, be, able, to, build, a, nation, great, in, justice, fair, trade, and, industry, the, war, cost, the, igbos, a, great, deal, in, terms, of, lives, money, and, infrastructure, it, has, been, estimated, that, up, to, one, million, people, may, have, died, due, to, the, conflict, most, from, hunger, and, disease, caused, by, nigerian, forces, more, than, half, a, million, people, died, from, the, famine, imposed, deliberately, through, blockade, throughout, the, war, lack, of, medicine, also, contributed, thousands, of, people, starved, to, death, every, day, as, the, war, progressed, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, in, september, 1968, estimated, 8, 000, to, 10, 000, deaths, from, starvation, each, day, the, leader, of, a, nigerian, peace, conference, delegation, said, in, 1968, that, starvation, is, a, legitimate, weapon, of, war, and, we, have, every, intention, of, using, it, against, the, rebels, this, stance, is, generally, considered, to, reflect, the, policy, of, the, nigerian, government, the, federal, nigerian, army, is, accused, of, further, atrocities, including, deliberate, bombing, of, civilians, mass, slaughter, with, machine, guns, and, rape, the, first, generation, of, igbo, nationalism, began, to, develop, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, the, war, ethnic, minorities, ibibio, ijaw, ikwerre, etche, ogoni, and, others, made, up, approximately, 40, of, the, biafran, population, in, 1966, the, attitude, of, ethnic, minorities, in, biafra, towards, the, conflict, were, initially, divided, early, in, the, war, having, suffered, the, same, fate, as, igbos, in, the, north, held, the, same, fear, and, dread, as, igbos, however, actions, by, biafra, authorities, suggesting, they, favoured, the, igbo, majority, turned, these, attitudes, negative, great, suspicion, was, directed, towards, ethnic, minorities, and, opponents, of, biafra, with, combing, exercises, conducted, to, sift, these, communities, for, saboteurs, or, sabo, as, they, were, commonly, branded, this, brand, was, widely, feared, as, it, generally, resulted, in, death, by, the, biafran, forces, or, even, mobs, the, accusations, subjected, entire, communities, to, violence, in, the, form, of, killings, rapes, kidnapping, and, internments, in, camps, by, biafran, forces, the, biafran, organization, of, freedom, fighter, boff, was, a, paramilitary, organisation, set, up, by, the, civil, defence, group, with, instructions, to, suppress, the, enemy, and, engaged, in, combing, exercises, in, minority, communities, minorities, in, biafra, suffered, atrocities, at, the, hands, of, those, fighting, for, both, sides, of, the, conflict, the, pogroms, in, the, north, in, 1966, were, indiscriminately, directed, against, people, from, eastern, nigeria, despite, a, seemingly, natural, alliance, between, these, victims, of, the, pogroms, in, the, north, tensions, rose, as, minorities, who, had, always, harboured, an, interest, in, having, their, own, state, within, the, nigerian, federation, were, suspected, of, collaborating, with, federal, troops, to, undermine, biafra, the, federal, troops, were, equally, culpable, of, this, crime, in, the, rivers, area, ethnic, minorities, sympathetic, to, biafra, were, killed, in, the, hundreds, by, federal, troops, in, calabar, some, 2000, efiks, were, also, killed, by, federal, troops, outside, of, the, biafra, atrocities, were, recorded, against, the, residents, of, asaba, in, present, day, delta, state, by, both, sides, of, the, conflict, legal, scholar, herbert, ekwe, ekwe, and, other, academics, argued, that, the, biafran, war, was, a, genocide, for, which, no, perpetrators, have, been, held, accountable, critics, of, this, position, acknowledge, that, starvation, policies, were, pursued, deliberately, and, that, accountability, has, not, been, sought, for, the, 1966, pogroms, but, suggest, that, claims, of, genocide, are, incongruous, with, the, fact, that, the, igbo, were, not, exterminated, after, the, war, ended, alongside, other, arguments, such, as, a, lack, of, clarity, surrounding, nigerian, intentions, and, that, nigeria, was, fighting, to, retain, control, of, biafra, and, its, people, rather, than, to, expel, or, exterminate, them, biafra, made, a, formal, complaint, of, genocide, against, igbos, to, the, international, committee, on, the, investigation, of, crimes, of, genocide, a, paris, based, ngo, of, international, lawyers, which, concluded, that, the, actions, undertaken, by, the, nigerian, government, against, the, igbo, amounted, to, a, genocide, with, special, reference, to, the, asaba, massacre, jurist, emma, okocha, described, the, killings, as, the, first, black, on, black, genocide, ekwe, ekwe, places, significant, blame, on, the, british, government, for, their, support, of, the, nigerian, government, which, he, argued, allowed, for, their, depredations, against, the, igbo, to, continue, reconstruction, helped, by, the, oil, money, was, swift, however, the, old, ethnic, and, religious, tensions, remained, a, constant, feature, of, nigerian, politics, accusations, were, made, of, nigerian, government, officials, diverting, resources, meant, for, reconstruction, in, the, former, biafran, areas, to, their, ethnic, areas, military, government, continued, in, power, in, nigeria, for, many, years, and, people, in, the, oil, producing, areas, claimed, they, were, being, denied, a, fair, share, of, oil, revenues, laws, were, passed, mandating, that, political, parties, could, not, be, ethnically, or, tribally, based, however, it, has, been, hard, to, make, this, work, in, practice, igbos, who, ran, for, their, lives, during, the, pogroms, and, war, returned, to, find, their, positions, had, been, taken, over, and, when, the, war, was, over, the, government, did, not, feel, any, need, to, re, instate, them, preferring, to, regard, them, as, having, resigned, this, reasoning, was, also, extended, to, igbo, owned, properties, and, houses, people, from, other, regions, were, quick, to, take, over, any, house, owned, by, an, igbo, especially, in, the, port, harcourt, area, the, nigerian, government,
