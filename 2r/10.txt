https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_North_America
the, big, history, of, north, america, encompasses, the, past, developments, of, people, populating, the, continent, of, north, america, while, it, was, commonly, accepted, that, the, continent, first, became, inhabited, by, humans, when, individuals, migrated, across, the, bering, sea, 40, 000, to, 17, 000, years, ago, more, recent, discoveries, may, have, pushed, those, estimates, back, at, least, another, 90, 000, years, people, settled, throughout, the, continent, and, over, time, developed, into, diverse, communities, from, the, inuit, in, the, far, north, to, the, mayans, and, aztecs, in, the, south, these, complex, communities, each, developed, their, own, unique, cultures, and, ways, of, life, records, of, european, travel, to, north, america, begin, with, the, norse, colonization, in, the, 10th, century, ad, in, 985, they, founded, a, settlement, on, greenland, that, persisted, until, the, early, 1400s, they, also, explored, the, east, coast, of, canada, but, their, settlements, there, were, much, smaller, and, shorter, lived, with, the, age, of, exploration, and, the, voyages, of, christopher, columbus, starting, in, 1492, europeans, began, to, arrive, in, the, americas, in, large, numbers, and, develop, colonial, ambitions, for, both, north, and, south, america, an, influx, of, europeans, soon, followed, columbus, and, overwhelmed, native, populations, as, north, america, became, a, staging, ground, for, ongoing, european, rivalries, the, continent, was, divided, by, three, prominent, european, powers, england, france, and, spain, the, influence, of, colonization, by, these, states, on, north, american, cultures, is, still, apparent, today, conflict, over, resources, in, north, america, ensued, in, various, wars, between, these, powers, but, the, new, european, colonies, gradually, developed, desires, for, independence, revolutions, such, as, the, american, revolution, and, the, mexican, war, of, independence, created, new, independent, states, that, came, to, dominate, north, america, the, canadian, confederation, formed, in, 1867, marking, the, beginning, of, the, modern, political, landscape, of, north, america, north, american, states, have, since, the, 19th, century, developed, increasingly, deep, connections, with, each, other, although, some, conflicts, have, occurred, the, continent, has, enjoyed, general, peace, and, cooperation, as, well, as, open, commerce, and, trade, between, its, states, modern, developments, include, the, opening, of, free, trade, agreements, in, 1994, and, heightened, emigration, rates, and, drug, trafficking, concerns, in, mexico, and, latin, america, the, specifics, of, paleo, indians, migration, to, and, throughout, the, americas, including, the, exact, dates, and, routes, traveled, are, subject, to, ongoing, research, and, discussion, for, years, the, traditional, theory, has, been, that, these, early, migrants, moved, into, the, beringia, land, bridge, between, eastern, siberia, and, present, day, alaska, around, 40, 000, 17, 000, years, ago, when, sea, levels, were, significantly, lowered, due, to, the, quaternary, glaciation, these, people, are, believed, to, have, followed, herds, of, now, extinct, pleistocene, megafauna, along, ice, free, corridors, that, stretched, between, the, laurentide, and, cordilleran, ice, sheets, another, route, proposed, is, that, either, on, foot, or, using, primitive, boats, they, migrated, down, the, pacific, coast, to, south, america, evidence, of, the, latter, would, since, have, been, covered, by, a, sea, level, rise, of, hundreds, of, meters, following, the, last, ice, age, archaeologists, contend, that, paleo, indian, migration, out, of, beringia, eastern, alaska, ranges, from, 40, 000, to, around, 16, 500, years, ago, this, time, range, is, a, hot, source, of, debate, and, promises, to, continue, as, such, for, years, to, come, the, few, agreements, achieved, to, date, are, the, origin, from, central, asia, with, widespread, habitation, of, the, americas, during, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, or, more, specifically, what, is, known, as, the, late, glacial, maximum, around, 16, 000, 13, 000, years, before, present, however, older, alternative, theories, exist, including, migration, from, europe, stone, tools, particularly, projectile, points, and, scrapers, are, the, primary, evidence, of, early, human, activity, in, the, americas, crafted, lithic, flaked, tools, are, used, by, archaeologists, and, anthropologists, to, classify, cultural, periods, scientific, evidence, links, indigenous, americans, to, asian, peoples, specifically, eastern, siberian, populations, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, have, been, linked, to, north, asian, populations, by, linguistic, dialects, the, distribution, of, blood, types, and, in, genetic, composition, as, reflected, by, molecular, data, such, as, dna, 8, 000, 7, 000, bce, 10, 000, 9, 000, years, ago, the, climate, stabilized, leading, to, a, rise, in, population, and, lithic, technology, advances, resulting, in, a, more, sedentary, lifestyle, before, contact, with, europeans, the, indigenous, peoples, of, north, america, were, divided, into, many, different, polities, from, small, bands, of, a, few, families, to, large, empires, they, lived, in, numerous, culture, areas, which, roughly, correspond, to, geographic, and, biological, zones, societies, adapted, their, subsistence, strategies, to, their, homelands, and, some, societies, were, hunter, gatherers, some, horticulturists, some, agriculturalists, and, many, a, mix, of, these, native, groups, can, also, be, classified, by, their, language, family, e, g, athapascan, or, uto, aztecan, people, with, similar, languages, did, not, always, share, the, same, material, culture, nor, were, they, always, allies, the, archaic, period, in, the, americas, saw, a, changing, environment, featuring, a, warmer, more, arid, climate, and, the, disappearance, of, the, last, megafauna, the, majority, of, population, groups, at, this, time, were, still, highly, mobile, hunter, gatherers, but, now, individual, groups, started, to, focus, on, resources, available, to, them, locally, thus, with, the, passage, of, time, there, is, a, pattern, of, increasing, regional, generalization, for, example, the, southwest, arctic, poverty, point, culture, plains, arctic, dalton, and, plano, traditions, this, type, of, regional, adaptation, became, the, norm, with, reliance, less, on, hunting, and, gathering, among, many, cultures, with, a, more, mixed, economy, of, small, game, fish, seasonally, wild, vegetables, and, harvested, plant, foods, many, groups, continued, as, big, game, hunters, but, their, hunting, traditions, became, more, varied, and, meat, procurement, methods, more, sophisticated, the, placement, of, artifacts, and, materials, within, an, archaic, burial, site, indicated, social, differentiation, based, upon, status, in, some, groups, agriculture, was, invented, independently, in, two, regions, of, north, america, the, eastern, woodlands, and, mesoamerica, the, more, southern, cultural, groups, of, north, america, were, responsible, for, the, domestication, of, many, common, crops, now, used, around, the, world, such, as, tomatoes, and, squash, perhaps, most, importantly, they, domesticated, one, of, the, world, s, major, staples, maize, corn, during, the, plains, village, period, agriculture, and, bison, hunting, were, important, to, great, plains, tribes, as, a, result, of, the, development, of, agriculture, in, the, south, many, important, cultural, advances, were, made, there, for, example, the, maya, civilization, developed, a, writing, system, built, huge, pyramids, had, a, complex, calendar, and, developed, the, concept, of, zero, 500, years, before, anyone, in, the, old, world, the, mayan, culture, was, still, present, when, the, spanish, arrived, in, central, america, but, political, dominance, in, the, area, had, shifted, to, the, aztec, empire, further, north, in, the, southwest, of, north, america, hohokam, and, ancestral, pueblo, societies, had, been, engaged, in, agricultural, production, with, ditch, irrigation, and, a, sedentary, village, life, for, at, least, two, millennia, before, the, spanish, arrived, in, the, 1540s, upon, the, arrival, of, the, europeans, in, the, new, world, native, peoples, found, their, culture, changed, drastically, as, such, their, affiliation, with, political, and, cultural, groups, changed, as, well, several, linguistic, groups, went, extinct, and, others, changed, quite, quickly, the, name, and, cultures, that, europeans, recorded, for, the, natives, were, not, necessarily, the, same, as, the, ones, they, had, used, a, few, generations, before, or, the, ones, in, use, today, according, to, the, maddison, project, at, the, university, of, groningen, in, the, netherlands, the, population, estimates, of, north, america, break, down, as, follows, for, the, year, 1500, ad, angus, maddison, estimates, a, population, of, 7, 5, million, for, pre, hispanic, mexico, he, estimates, that, the, population, of, what, became, canada, was, probably, close, to, 250, 000, and, 2, million, for, what, became, the, united, states, maddison, s, total, for, all, of, pre, contact, north, america, then, is, 9, 75, million, in, 2020, indigenous, peoples, numbered, 34, million, 25, 7, million, for, mexico, 6, 7, million, for, the, united, states, and, 1, 6, million, for, canada, approximately, 7, percent, of, north, america, s, total, population, of, 493, 4, million, there, was, limited, contact, between, north, american, people, and, the, outside, world, before, 1492, several, theoretical, contacts, have, been, proposed, but, the, earliest, physical, evidence, comes, from, the, norse, or, vikings, erik, the, red, founded, a, colony, on, greenland, in, 985, ce, erik, s, son, leif, eriksson, is, believed, to, have, reached, the, island, of, newfoundland, c, 1000, naming, the, discovery, vinland, the, only, norse, site, outside, of, greenland, yet, discovered, in, north, america, is, at, l, anse, aux, meadows, newfoundland, and, labrador, in, canada, all, of, the, norse, colonies, were, eventually, abandoned, the, norse, voyages, did, not, become, common, knowledge, in, the, old, world, even, the, permanent, settlement, in, greenland, which, persisted, until, the, early, 1400s, received, little, attention, and, europeans, remained, largely, ignorant, of, the, existence, of, the, americas, until, 1492, as, part, of, a, general, age, of, discovery, italian, sailor, christopher, columbus, proposed, a, voyage, west, from, europe, to, find, a, shorter, route, to, asia, he, eventually, received, the, backing, of, isabella, i, and, ferdinand, ii, queen, and, king, of, newly, united, spain, in, 1492, columbus, reached, land, in, the, bahamas, almost, 500, years, after, the, norse, john, cabot, explored, the, east, coast, of, what, would, become, canada, in, 1497, giovanni, da, verrazzano, explored, the, east, coast, of, north, america, from, florida, to, presumably, newfoundland, in, 1524, jacques, cartier, made, a, series, of, voyages, on, behalf, of, the, french, crown, in, 1534, and, explored, the, st, lawrence, river, colonization, refers, to, large, scale, population, movements, in, which, the, migrants, maintain, strong, links, with, their, or, their, ancestors, former, country, gaining, significant, advantages, over, other, inhabitants, of, the, territory, by, such, links, when, colonization, takes, place, under, the, protection, of, clearly, colonial, political, structures, it, may, most, handily, be, called, settler, colonialism, this, often, involves, the, settlers, entirely, dispossessing, earlier, inhabitants, or, instituting, legal, and, other, structures, which, systematically, disadvantage, them, initially, european, activity, consisted, mostly, of, trade, and, exploration, eventually, europeans, began, to, establish, settlements, the, three, principal, colonial, powers, in, north, america, were, spain, england, and, france, although, eventually, other, powers, such, as, the, netherlands, and, sweden, also, received, holdings, on, the, continent, settlement, by, the, spanish, started, the, european, colonization, of, the, americas, they, gained, control, of, most, of, the, largest, islands, in, the, caribbean, and, conquered, the, aztec, empire, gaining, control, of, present, day, mexico, and, central, america, this, was, the, beginning, of, the, spanish, empire, in, the, new, world, the, first, successful, spanish, settlement, in, continental, north, america, was, veracruz, founded, by, hern, n, cort, s, in, 1519, followed, by, many, other, settlements, in, colonial, new, spain, including, spanish, florida, central, america, new, mexico, and, later, california, the, spanish, claimed, all, of, north, and, south, america, with, the, exception, of, brazil, and, no, other, european, power, challenged, those, claims, by, planting, colonies, until, over, a, century, after, spain, s, first, settlements, the, first, french, settlements, were, port, royal, 1604, and, quebec, city, 1608, in, what, is, now, nova, scotia, and, quebec, the, fur, trade, soon, became, the, primary, business, on, the, continent, and, as, a, result, transformed, the, indigenous, north, american, ways, of, life, the, first, permanent, english, settlements, were, at, jamestown, 1607, along, with, its, satellite, bermuda, in, 1609, and, plymouth, 1620, in, what, are, today, virginia, and, massachusetts, respectively, further, to, the, south, plantation, slavery, became, the, main, industry, of, the, west, indies, and, this, gave, rise, to, the, beginning, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, by, the, year, 1663, the, french, crown, had, taken, over, control, of, new, france, from, the, fur, trading, companies, and, the, english, charter, colonies, gave, way, to, more, metropolitan, control, this, ushered, in, a, new, era, of, more, formalized, colonialism, in, north, america, rivalry, between, the, european, powers, created, a, series, of, wars, on, the, north, american, landmass, that, would, have, great, impact, on, the, development, of, the, colonies, territory, often, changed, hands, multiple, times, peace, was, not, achieved, until, french, forces, in, north, america, were, vanquished, at, the, battle, of, the, plains, of, abraham, at, quebec, city, and, france, ceded, most, of, her, claims, outside, of, the, caribbean, the, end, of, the, french, presence, in, north, america, was, a, disaster, for, most, native, nations, in, eastern, north, america, who, lost, their, major, ally, against, the, expanding, anglo, american, settlements, during, pontiac, s, rebellion, from, 1763, to, 1766, a, confederation, of, great, lakes, area, tribes, fought, a, somewhat, successful, campaign, to, defend, their, rights, over, their, lands, west, of, the, appalachian, mountains, which, had, been, reserved, for, them, under, the, royal, proclamation, of, 1763, viceroyalty, of, new, spain, present, day, mexico, was, the, name, of, the, viceroy, ruled, territories, of, the, spanish, empire, in, asia, north, america, and, its, peripheries, from, 1535, to, 1821, the, coming, of, the, american, revolution, had, a, great, impact, across, the, continent, most, importantly, it, directly, led, to, the, creation, of, the, united, states, of, america, however, the, associated, american, revolutionary, war, was, an, important, war, that, touched, all, corners, of, the, region, the, flight, of, the, united, empire, loyalists, led, to, the, creation, of, english, canada, as, a, separate, community, meanwhile, spain, s, hold, on, mexico, was, weakening, independence, was, declared, in, 1810, by, miguel, hidalgo, starting, the, mexican, war, of, independence, in, 1813, jos, mar, a, morelos, and, the, congress, of, an, huac, signed, the, solemn, act, of, the, declaration, of, independence, of, northern, america, the, first, legal, document, where, the, separation, of, the, new, spain, with, respect, to, spain, is, proclaimed, spain, finally, recognized, mexico, s, independence, in, 1821, from, the, time, of, independence, of, the, united, states, that, country, expanded, rapidly, to, the, west, acquiring, the, massive, louisiana, territory, in, 1803, between, 1810, and, 1811, a, native, confederacy, under, tecumseh, fought, unsuccessfully, to, keep, the, americans, from, pushing, them, out, of, the, great, lakes, tecumseh, s, followers, then, went, north, into, canada, where, they, helped, the, british, to, block, an, american, attempt, to, seize, canada, during, the, war, of, 1812, following, the, war, british, and, irish, settlement, in, canada, increased, dramatically, us, expansion, was, complicated, by, the, division, between, free, and, slave, states, which, led, to, the, missouri, compromise, in, 1820, likewise, canada, faced, a, division, between, french, and, english, communities, that, led, to, the, outbreak, of, civil, strife, in, 1837, mexico, faced, constant, political, tensions, between, liberals, and, conservatives, as, well, as, the, rebellion, of, the, english, speaking, region, of, texas, which, declared, itself, the, republic, of, texas, in, 1836, in, 1845, texas, joined, the, united, states, which, would, later, lead, to, the, mexican, american, war, in, 1846, that, began, american, imperialism, as, a, result, of, conflict, with, mexico, the, united, states, made, further, territorial, gains, in, california, and, the, southwest, the, secession, of, the, confederate, states, and, the, resulting, civil, war, rocked, american, society, it, eventually, led, to, the, end, of, slavery, in, the, united, states, the, destruction, and, later, reconstruction, of, most, of, the, south, and, tremendous, loss, of, life, from, the, conflict, the, united, states, emerged, as, a, powerful, industrialized, nation, partly, as, a, response, to, the, threat, of, american, power, four, of, the, canadian, colonies, agreed, to, federate, in, 1867, creating, the, dominion, of, canada, the, new, nation, was, not, fully, sovereign, but, enjoyed, considerable, independence, from, britain, with, the, addition, of, british, columbia, canada, would, expand, to, the, pacific, by, 1871, and, establish, a, transcontinental, railway, the, canadian, pacific, by, 1885, in, mexico, conflicts, such, as, the, reform, war, left, the, state, weak, and, open, to, foreign, influence, this, led, to, the, second, french, empire, to, invade, mexico, in, both, the, united, states, and, canada, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, witnessed, massive, inflows, of, immigration, to, settle, the, west, these, lands, were, not, uninhabited, however, in, the, united, states, the, government, fought, numerous, indian, wars, against, the, native, inhabitants, in, canada, relations, were, more, peaceful, as, a, result, of, the, numbered, treaties, but, two, rebellions, broke, out, in, 1870, and, 1885, on, the, prairies, the, british, colony, of, newfoundland, became, a, dominion, in, 1907, in, mexico, the, entire, era, was, dominated, by, the, dictatorship, of, porfirio, d, az, as, a, part, of, the, british, empire, canada, immediately, was, at, war, in, 1914, canada, bore, the, brunt, of, several, major, battles, during, the, early, stages, of, the, war, including, the, use, of, poison, gas, attacks, at, ypres, losses, became, grave, and, the, government, eventually, brought, in, conscription, despite, the, fact, this, was, against, the, wishes, of, the, majority, of, french, canadians, in, the, ensuing, conscription, crisis, of, 1917, riots, broke, out, on, the, streets, of, montreal, in, neighboring, newfoundland, the, new, dominion, suffered, a, devastating, loss, on, july, 1, 1916, the, first, day, on, the, somme, the, united, states, stayed, apart, from, the, conflict, until, 1917, joining, the, entente, powers, the, united, states, was, then, able, to, play, a, crucial, role, at, the, paris, peace, conference, of, 1919, that, shaped, interwar, europe, mexico, was, not, part, of, the, war, as, the, country, was, embroiled, in, the, mexican, revolution, at, the, time, the, 1920s, brought, an, age, of, great, prosperity, in, the, united, states, and, to, a, lesser, degree, canada, but, the, wall, street, crash, of, 1929, combined, with, drought, ushered, in, a, period, of, economic, hardship, in, the, united, states, and, canada, from, 1937, to, 1949, this, was, a, popular, uprising, against, the, anti, catholic, mexican, government, of, the, time, set, off, specifically, by, the, anti, clerical, provisions, of, the, mexican, constitution, of, 1917, once, again, canada, found, itself, at, war, before, her, neighbors, however, even, canadian, contributions, were, slight, before, the, japanese, attack, on, pearl, harbor, the, entry, of, the, united, states, into, the, war, helped, to, tip, the, balance, in, favor, of, the, allies, on, august, 19, 1942, a, force, of, some, 6000, largely, canadian, infantry, was, landed, near, the, french, channel, port, of, dieppe, the, german, defenders, under, general, von, rundstedt, destroyed, the, invaders, 907, canadians, were, killed, and, almost, 2, 500, captured, many, wounded, lessons, learned, in, this, abortive, raid, were, put, to, good, use, 2, years, later, in, the, successful, normandy, invasion, two, mexican, tankers, transporting, oil, to, the, united, states, were, attacked, and, sunk, by, the, germans, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, waters, in, 1942, the, incident, happened, in, spite, of, mexico, s, neutrality, at, that, time, this, led, mexico, to, declare, war, on, the, axis, nations, and, enter, the, conflict, the, destruction, of, europe, wrought, by, the, war, vaulted, all, north, american, countries, to, more, important, roles, in, world, affairs, the, united, states, especially, emerged, as, a, superpower, the, early, cold, war, era, saw, the, united, states, as, the, most, powerful, nation, in, a, western, coalition, of, which, mexico, and, canada, were, also, a, part, at, home, the, united, states, witnessed, convulsive, change, especially, in, the, area, of, race, relations, in, canada, this, was, mirrored, by, the, quiet, revolution, and, the, emergence, of, quebec, nationalism, mexico, experienced, an, era, of, huge, economic, growth, after, world, war, ii, a, heavy, industrialization, process, and, a, growth, of, its, middle, class, a, period, known, in, mexican, history, as, the, el, milagro, mexicano, mexican, miracle, the, caribbean, saw, the, beginnings, of, decolonization, while, on, the, largest, island, the, cuban, revolution, introduced, cold, war, rivalries, into, latin, america, in, 1959, the, non, contiguous, us, territories, of, alaska, and, hawaii, became, us, states, during, this, time, the, united, states, became, involved, in, the, vietnam, war, as, part, of, the, global, cold, war, this, war, would, later, prove, to, be, highly, divisive, in, american, society, and, american, troops, were, withdrawn, from, indochina, in, 1975, with, the, khmer, rouge, s, capture, of, phnom, penh, on, april, 17, the, vietnam, people, s, army, s, capture, of, saigon, on, april, 30, and, the, pathet, lao, s, capture, of, vientiane, on, december, 2, canada, during, this, era, was, dominated, by, the, leadership, of, pierre, elliot, trudeau, eventually, in, 1982, at, the, end, of, his, tenure, canada, received, a, new, constitution, both, the, united, states, and, canada, experienced, stagflation, which, eventually, led, to, a, revival, in, small, government, politics, mexican, presidents, miguel, de, la, madrid, in, the, early, 1980s, and, carlos, salinas, de, gortari, in, the, late, 1980s, started, implementing, liberal, economic, strategies, that, were, seen, as, a, good, move, however, mexico, experienced, a, strong, economic, recession, in, 1982, and, the, mexican, peso, suffered, a, devaluation, presidential, elections, held, in, 1988, were, forecast, to, be, very, competitive, and, they, were, leftist, candidate, cuauht, moc, c, rdenas, son, of, l, zaro, c, rdenas, one, of, the, most, beloved, mexican, presidents, created, a, successful, campaign, and, was, reported, as, the, leader, in, several, opinion, polls, on, july, 6, 1988, the, day, of, the, elections, a, system, shutdown, of, the, ibm, as, 400, that, the, government, was, using, to, count, the, votes, occurred, presumably, by, accident, the, government, simply, stated, that, se, cay, el, sistema, the, system, crashed, to, refer, to, the, incident, when, the, system, was, finally, restored, the, pri, candidate, carlos, salinas, was, declared, the, official, winner, it, was, the, first, time, since, the, revolution, that, a, non, pri, candidate, was, so, close, to, winning, the, presidency, in, the, united, states, president, ronald, reagan, attempted, to, move, the, united, states, back, towards, a, hard, anti, communist, line, in, foreign, affairs, in, what, his, supporters, saw, as, an, attempt, to, assert, moral, leadership, compared, to, the, soviet, union, in, the, world, community, domestically, reagan, attempted, to, bring, in, a, package, of, privatization, and, trickle, down, economics, to, stimulate, the, economy, canada, s, brian, mulroney, ran, on, a, similar, platform,
