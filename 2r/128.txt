in, japanese, history, the, j, mon, period, j, mon, jidai, is, the, time, between, c, 14, 000, and, 300, bc, during, which, japan, was, inhabited, by, a, diverse, hunter, gatherer, and, early, agriculturalist, population, united, through, a, common, j, mon, culture, which, reached, a, considerable, degree, of, sedentism, and, cultural, complexity, the, name, cord, marked, was, first, applied, by, the, american, zoologist, and, orientalist, edward, s, morse, who, discovered, sherds, of, pottery, in, 1877, and, subsequently, translated, straw, rope, pattern, into, japanese, as, j, mon, the, pottery, style, characteristic, of, the, first, phases, of, j, mon, culture, was, decorated, by, impressing, cords, into, the, surface, of, wet, clay, and, is, generally, accepted, to, be, among, the, oldest, in, the, world, the, j, mon, period, was, rich, in, tools, and, jewelry, made, from, bone, stone, shell, and, antler, pottery, figurines, and, vessels, and, lacquerware, it, is, often, compared, to, pre, columbian, cultures, of, the, north, american, pacific, northwest, and, especially, to, the, valdivia, culture, in, ecuador, because, in, these, settings, cultural, complexity, developed, within, a, primarily, hunting, gathering, context, with, limited, use, of, horticulture, the, approximately, 14, 000, year, j, mon, period, is, conventionally, divided, into, several, phases, progressively, shorter, incipient, 13, 750, 8, 500, bc, initial, 8, 500, 5, 000, early, 5, 000, 3, 520, middle, 3, 520, 2, 470, late, 2, 470, 1, 250, and, final, 1, 250, 500, the, fact, that, this, entire, period, is, given, the, same, name, by, archaeologists, should, not, be, taken, to, mean, that, there, was, not, considerable, regional, and, temporal, diversity, the, time, between, the, earliest, j, mon, pottery, and, that, of, the, more, well, known, middle, j, mon, period, is, about, twice, as, long, as, the, span, separating, the, building, of, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, from, the, 21st, century, dating, of, the, j, mon, sub, phases, is, based, primarily, upon, ceramic, typology, and, to, a, lesser, extent, radiocarbon, dating, recent, findings, have, refined, the, final, phase, of, the, j, mon, period, to, 300, bc, the, yayoi, period, started, between, 500, and, 300, bc, according, to, radio, carbon, evidence, while, yayoi, styled, pottery, was, found, in, a, j, mon, site, of, northern, kyushu, already, in, 800, bc, the, earliest, pottery, in, japan, was, made, at, or, before, the, start, of, the, incipient, j, mon, period, small, fragments, dated, to, 14, 500, bc, were, found, at, the, odai, yamamoto, i, site, in, 1998, pottery, of, roughly, the, same, age, was, subsequently, found, at, other, sites, such, as, in, kamikuroiwa, and, the, fukui, cave, the, first, j, mon, pottery, is, characterized, by, the, cord, marking, that, gives, the, period, its, name, and, has, now, been, found, in, large, numbers, of, sites, the, pottery, of, the, period, has, been, classified, by, archaeologists, into, some, 70, styles, with, many, more, local, varieties, of, the, styles, the, antiquity, of, j, mon, pottery, was, first, identified, after, world, war, ii, through, radiocarbon, dating, methods, the, earliest, vessels, were, mostly, smallish, round, bottomed, bowls, 10, 50, cm, high, that, are, assumed, to, have, been, used, for, boiling, food, and, perhaps, storing, it, beforehand, they, belonged, to, hunter, gatherers, and, the, size, of, the, vessels, may, have, been, limited, by, a, need, for, portability, as, later, bowls, increase, in, size, this, is, taken, to, be, a, sign, of, an, increasingly, settled, pattern, of, living, these, types, continued, to, develop, with, increasingly, elaborate, patterns, of, decoration, undulating, rims, and, flat, bottoms, so, that, they, could, stand, on, a, surface, the, manufacture, of, pottery, typically, implies, some, form, of, sedentary, life, because, pottery, is, heavy, bulky, and, fragile, and, thus, generally, unsuitable, for, hunter, gatherers, however, this, does, not, seem, to, have, been, the, case, with, the, first, j, mon, people, who, perhaps, numbered, 20, 000, individuals, over, the, whole, archipelago, it, seems, that, food, sources, were, so, abundant, in, the, natural, environment, of, the, japanese, islands, that, they, could, support, fairly, large, semi, sedentary, populations, the, j, mon, people, used, chipped, stone, tools, ground, stone, tools, traps, and, bows, and, were, evidently, skillful, coastal, and, deep, water, fishers, incipient, j, mon, 14, 000, 7500, bc, initial, j, mon, 7500, 4000, bc, early, j, mon, 5000, 3520, bc, middle, j, mon, 3520, 2470, bc, late, j, mon, 2470, 1250, bc, final, j, mon, 1250, 500, bc, traces, of, paleolithic, culture, mainly, stone, tools, occur, in, japan, from, around, 30, 000, bc, onwards, the, earliest, incipient, j, mon, phase, began, while, japan, was, still, linked, to, continental, asia, as, a, narrow, peninsula, as, the, glaciers, melted, following, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, approximately, 12, 000, bc, sea, levels, rose, separating, the, japanese, archipelago, from, the, asian, mainland, the, closest, point, in, kyushu, about, 190, km, 120, mi, from, the, korean, peninsula, is, near, enough, to, be, intermittently, influenced, by, continental, developments, but, far, enough, removed, for, the, peoples, of, the, japanese, islands, to, develop, independently, the, main, connection, between, the, japanese, archipelago, and, mainland, asia, was, through, the, korean, peninsula, to, kyushu, and, honshu, in, addition, luzon, taiwan, ryukyu, and, kyushu, constitute, a, continuous, chain, of, islands, connecting, the, j, mon, with, southeast, asia, while, honshu, hokkaido, and, sakhalin, connected, the, j, mon, with, siberia, within, the, archipelago, the, vegetation, was, transformed, by, the, end, of, the, ice, age, in, southwestern, honshu, shikoku, and, kyushu, broadleaf, evergreen, trees, dominated, the, forests, whereas, broadleaf, deciduous, trees, and, conifers, were, common, in, northeastern, honshu, and, southern, hokkaido, many, native, tree, species, such, as, beeches, buckeyes, chestnuts, and, oaks, produced, edible, nuts, and, acorns, these, provided, substantial, sources, of, food, for, both, humans, and, animals, in, the, northeast, the, plentiful, marine, life, carried, south, by, the, oyashio, current, especially, salmon, was, another, major, food, source, settlements, along, both, the, sea, of, japan, and, the, pacific, ocean, subsisted, on, immense, amounts, of, shellfish, leaving, distinctive, middens, mounds, of, discarded, shells, and, other, refuse, that, are, now, prized, sources, of, information, for, archaeologists, other, food, sources, meriting, special, mention, include, sika, deer, wild, boar, with, possible, wild, pig, management, wild, plants, such, as, yam, like, tubers, and, freshwater, fish, supported, by, the, highly, productive, deciduous, forests, and, an, abundance, of, seafood, the, population, was, concentrated, in, honshu, and, kyushu, but, j, mon, sites, range, from, hokkaido, to, the, ryukyu, islands, tigers, once, existed, in, the, japanese, archipelago, but, they, became, extinct, in, prehistoric, times, the, early, j, mon, period, saw, an, explosion, in, population, as, indicated, by, the, number, of, larger, aggregated, villages, from, this, period, this, period, occurred, during, the, holocene, climatic, optimum, when, the, local, climate, became, warmer, and, more, humid, the, degree, to, which, horticulture, or, small, scale, agriculture, was, practiced, by, j, mon, people, is, debated, currently, there, is, no, scientific, consensus, to, support, a, conceptualization, of, j, mon, period, culture, as, only, hunter, gatherer, there, is, evidence, to, suggest, that, arboriculture, was, practiced, in, the, form, of, tending, groves, of, lacquer, toxicodendron, verniciflua, and, nut, castanea, crenata, and, aesculus, turbinata, producing, trees, as, well, as, soybean, bottle, gourd, hemp, perilla, adzuki, among, others, these, characteristics, place, them, somewhere, in, between, hunting, gathering, and, agriculture, an, apparently, domesticated, variety, of, peach, appeared, very, early, at, j, mon, sites, in, 6700, 6400, bp, 4700, 4400, bc, this, was, already, similar, to, modern, cultivated, forms, this, domesticated, type, of, peach, was, apparently, brought, into, japan, from, china, nevertheless, in, china, itself, this, variety, is, currently, attested, only, at, a, later, date, of, 5300, 4300, bp, highly, ornate, pottery, dog, figurines, and, vessels, such, as, the, so, called, flame, style, vessels, and, lacquered, wood, objects, remain, from, that, time, although, the, ornamentation, of, pottery, increased, over, time, the, ceramic, fabric, always, remained, quite, coarse, during, this, time, magatama, stone, beads, make, a, transition, from, being, a, common, jewelry, item, found, in, homes, into, serving, as, a, grave, good, this, is, a, period, where, there, are, large, burial, mounds, and, monuments, this, period, saw, a, rise, in, complexity, in, the, design, of, pit, houses, the, most, commonly, used, method, of, housing, at, the, time, with, some, even, having, paved, stone, floors, a, study, in, 2015, found, that, this, form, of, dwelling, continued, up, until, the, satsumon, culture, using, archaeological, data, on, pollen, count, this, phase, is, the, warmest, of, all, the, phases, by, the, end, of, this, phase, the, warm, climate, starts, to, enter, a, cooling, trend, after, 1500, bc, the, climate, cooled, entering, a, stage, of, neoglaciation, and, populations, seem, to, have, contracted, dramatically, comparatively, few, archaeological, sites, can, be, found, after, 1500, bc, the, japanese, chestnut, castanea, crenata, becomes, essential, not, only, as, a, nut, bearing, tree, but, also, because, it, was, extremely, durable, in, wet, conditions, and, became, the, most, used, timber, for, building, houses, during, the, late, j, mon, phase, during, the, final, j, mon, period, a, slow, shift, was, taking, place, in, western, japan, steadily, increasing, contact, with, the, korean, peninsula, eventually, led, to, the, establishment, of, korean, type, settlements, in, western, kyushu, beginning, around, 900, bc, the, settlers, brought, with, them, new, technologies, such, as, wet, rice, farming, and, bronze, and, iron, metallurgy, as, well, as, new, pottery, styles, similar, to, those, of, the, mumun, pottery, period, the, settlements, of, these, new, arrivals, seem, to, have, coexisted, with, those, of, the, j, mon, and, yayoi, for, around, a, thousand, years, outside, hokkaido, the, final, j, mon, is, succeeded, by, a, new, farming, culture, the, yayoi, c, 300, bc, ad, 300, named, after, an, archaeological, site, near, tokyo, within, hokkaido, the, j, mon, is, succeeded, by, the, okhotsk, culture, and, zoku, j, mon, post, j, mon, or, epi, j, mon, culture, which, later, replaced, or, merged, with, the, satsumon, culture, around, the, 7th, century, at, the, end, of, the, j, mon, period, the, local, population, declined, sharply, scientists, suggest, that, this, was, possibly, caused, by, food, shortages, and, other, environmental, problems, they, concluded, that, not, all, j, mon, groups, suffered, under, these, circumstances, but, the, overall, population, declined, examining, the, remains, of, the, people, who, lived, throughout, the, j, mon, period, there, is, evidence, that, these, deaths, were, not, inflicted, by, warfare, or, violence, on, a, large, enough, scale, to, cause, these, deaths, the, origin, myths, of, japanese, civilization, extend, back, to, periods, now, regarded, as, part, of, the, j, mon, period, but, they, show, little, or, no, relation, to, the, current, archaeological, understanding, of, j, mon, culture, the, traditional, founding, date, of, the, japanese, nation, by, emperor, jimmu, is, february, 11, 660, bc, that, version, of, japanese, history, however, comes, from, the, country, s, first, written, records, the, kojiki, and, the, nihon, shoki, dating, from, the, 6th, to, the, 8th, centuries, after, japan, had, adopted, chinese, characters, go, on, kan, on, some, elements, of, modern, japanese, culture, may, date, from, the, period, and, reflect, the, influences, of, a, mingled, migration, from, the, northern, asian, continent, and, the, southern, pacific, areas, and, the, local, j, mon, peoples, among, those, elements, are, the, precursors, to, shinto, marriage, customs, architectural, styles, and, technological, developments, such, as, lacquerware, laminated, bows, called, yumi, and, metalworking, the, relationship, of, j, mon, people, to, the, modern, japanese, yamato, people, ryukyuans, and, ainu, is, not, clear, morphological, studies, of, dental, variation, and, genetic, studies, suggest, that, the, j, mon, people, were, rather, diverse, and, mitochondrial, dna, studies, indicate, the, j, mon, people, were, closely, related, to, modern, day, east, asians, the, contemporary, japanese, people, descended, from, a, mixture, of, the, various, ancient, hunter, gatherer, tribes, of, the, j, mon, period, and, the, yayoi, rice, agriculturalists, and, these, two, major, ancestral, groups, came, to, japan, over, different, routes, at, different, times, the, modern, day, japanese, population, carries, approximately, 30, paternal, ancestry, from, the, j, mon, this, is, far, higher, than, the, maternal, j, mon, contribution, of, around, 15, and, autosomal, contribution, of, 10, to, the, japanese, population, this, imbalanced, inheritance, has, been, referred, to, as, the, admixture, paradox, and, is, thought, to, hold, clues, as, to, how, the, admixture, between, the, j, mon, and, yayoi, cultures, took, place, according, to, mitsuru, sakitani, the, j, mon, people, are, an, admixture, of, several, paleolithic, populations, he, suggests, that, y, chromosome, haplogroups, c1a1, and, d, m55, are, two, of, the, j, mon, lineages, the, maternal, haplogroups, m7a, n9b, and, g1b, have, been, identified, from, ancient, j, mon, specimens, according, to, study, j, mon, culture, and, the, peopling, of, the, japanese, archipelago, by, schmidt, and, seguchi, 2014, the, prehistoric, j, mon, people, descended, from, diverse, paleolithic, populations, with, multiple, migrations, into, j, mon, period, japan, they, concluded, in, this, respect, the, biological, identity, of, the, j, mon, is, heterogeneous, and, it, may, be, indicative, of, diverse, peoples, who, possibly, belonged, to, a, common, culture, known, as, the, j, mon, a, study, by, lee, and, hasegawa, of, waseda, university, concluded, that, the, j, mon, period, population, of, hokkaido, consisted, of, two, distinctive, populations, which, later, merged, to, form, the, proto, ainu, in, northern, hokkaido, the, ainu, language, can, be, connected, to, an, okhotsk, component, which, spread, southwards, they, further, concluded, that, the, dual, structure, theory, regarding, the, population, history, of, japan, must, be, revised, and, that, the, j, mon, people, had, more, diversity, than, originally, suggested, a, 2015, study, found, specific, gene, alleles, related, to, facial, structure, and, features, among, some, ainu, individuals, which, largely, descended, from, local, hokkaido, j, mon, groups, these, alleles, are, typically, associated, with, europeans, but, absent, from, other, east, asians, including, japanese, people, which, suggests, geneflow, from, a, currently, unidentified, source, population, into, the, j, mon, period, population, of, hokkaido, although, these, specific, alleles, can, explain, the, unusual, physical, appearance, of, certain, ainu, individuals, compared, to, other, northeast, asians, the, exact, origin, of, these, alleles, remains, unknown, full, genome, analyses, in, 2020, and, 2021, revealed, further, information, regarding, the, origin, of, the, j, mon, peoples, the, genetic, results, suggest, early, admixture, between, different, groups, in, japan, already, during, the, paleolithic, followed, by, constant, geneflow, from, coastal, east, asian, groups, resulting, in, a, heterogeneous, population, which, then, homogenized, until, the, arrival, of, the, yayoi, people, geneflow, from, northeast, asia, during, the, j, mon, period, is, associated, with, the, c1a1, and, c2, lineages, geneflow, from, the, tibetan, plateau, and, southern, china, is, associated, with, the, d1a2a, previously, d1b, and, d1a1, previously, d1a, lineages, geneflow, from, ancient, siberia, into, the, northern, j, mon, people, of, hokkaido, was, also, detected, with, later, geneflow, from, hokkaido, into, parts, of, northern, honshu, tohoku, the, lineages, k, and, f, are, suggested, to, have, been, presented, during, the, early, j, mon, period, but, got, replaced, by, c, and, d, the, analysis, of, a, j, mon, sample, ikawazu, shell, mound, tahara, japan, and, an, ancient, sample, from, the, tibetan, plateau, chokhopani, china, found, only, partially, shared, ancestry, pointing, towards, a, positive, genetic, bottleneck, regarding, the, spread, of, haplogroup, d, from, ancient, east, asian, highlanders, related, to, modern, day, tujia, people, yao, people, and, tibetans, as, well, as, tripuri, people, the, genetic, evidence, suggests, that, an, east, asian, source, population, near, the, himalayan, mountain, range, contributed, ancestry, to, the, j, mon, period, population, of, japan, and, less, to, ancient, southeast, asians, the, authors, concluded, that, this, points, to, an, inland, migration, through, southern, or, central, china, towards, japan, during, the, paleolithic, another, ancestry, component, seem, to, have, arrived, from, siberia, into, hokkaido, archeological, and, biological, evidence, link, the, southern, j, mon, culture, of, kyushu, shikoku, and, parts, of, honshu, to, cultures, of, southern, china, and, northeast, india, a, common, culture, known, as, the, broadleafed, evergreen, forest, culture, ranged, from, southwestern, japan, through, southern, china, towards, northeast, india, and, southern, tibet, and, was, characterized, by, the, cultivation, of, azuki, beans, some, linguists, suggest, that, the, japonic, languages, were, already, present, within, the, japanese, archipelago, and, coastal, korea, before, the, yayoi, period, and, can, be, linked, to, one, of, the, j, mon, populations, of, southwestern, japan, rather, than, the, later, yayoi, or, kofun, period, rice, agriculturalists, japonic, speakers, then, expanded, during, the, yayoi, period, assimilating, the, newcomers, adopting, rice, agriculture, and, fusing, mainland, asian, technologies, with, local, traditions, vovin, 2021, presented, arguments, for, the, presence, of, austronesian, peoples, within, the, japanese, archipelago, during, the, j, mon, period, based, on, previous, linguistic, research, and, specific, austronesian, vocabulary, loaned, into, the, core, vocabulary, of, insular, japanese, he, suggests, that, austronesian, speakers, arrived, in, japan, during, the, j, mon, period, and, prior, to, the, arrival, of, yayoi, period, migrants, associated, with, the, spread, of, japonic, languages, these, austronesian, speakers, were, subsequently, assimilated, into, the, japanese, ethnicity, evidence, for, non, ainuic, non, austronesian, and, non, korean, loanwords, are, found, among, insular, japonic, languages, and, probably, derived, from, unknown, and, extinct, j, mon, languages, modern, public, perception, of, j, mon, has, gradually, changed, from, primitive, and, obsolete, to, captivating
