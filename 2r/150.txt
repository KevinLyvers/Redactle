24th, tirthankara, who, synthesised, and, revived, the, philosophies, and, promulgations, of, the, ancient, rama, ic, traditions, laid, down, by, the, first, jain, tirthankara, rishabhanatha, millions, of, years, ago, buddha, founded, buddhism, which, received, royal, patronage, in, the, kingdom, according, to, indologist, johannes, bronkhorst, the, culture, of, magadha, was, in, fundamental, ways, different, from, the, vedic, kingdoms, of, the, indo, aryans, according, to, bronkhorst, the, ramana, culture, arose, in, greater, magadha, which, was, indo, aryan, but, not, vedic, in, this, culture, kshatriyas, were, placed, higher, than, brahmins, and, it, rejected, vedic, authority, and, rituals, he, argues, for, a, cultural, area, termed, greater, magadha, defined, as, roughly, the, geographical, area, in, which, the, buddha, and, mahavira, lived, and, taught, with, regard, to, the, buddha, this, area, stretched, by, and, large, from, r, vast, the, capital, of, kosala, in, the, north, west, to, r, jag, ha, the, capital, of, magadha, in, the, south, east, according, to, bronkhorst, there, was, indeed, a, culture, of, greater, magadha, which, remained, recognizably, distinct, from, vedic, culture, until, the, time, of, the, grammarian, pata, jali, ca, 150, bce, and, beyond, the, buddhologist, alexander, wynne, writes, that, there, is, an, overwhelming, amount, of, evidence, to, suggest, that, this, rival, culture, to, the, vedic, aryans, dominated, the, eastern, gangetic, plain, during, the, early, buddhist, period, orthodox, vedic, brahmins, were, therefore, a, minority, in, magadha, during, this, early, period, the, magadhan, religions, are, termed, the, sramana, traditions, and, include, jainism, buddhism, and, j, vika, buddhism, and, jainism, were, the, religions, promoted, by, the, early, magadhan, kings, such, as, srenika, bimbisara, and, ajatashatru, and, the, nanda, dynasty, 345, 321, bce, that, followed, was, mostly, jain, these, sramana, religions, did, not, worship, the, vedic, deities, practised, some, form, of, asceticism, and, meditation, jhana, and, tended, to, construct, round, burial, mounds, called, stupas, in, buddhism, these, religions, also, sought, some, type, of, liberation, from, the, cyclic, rounds, of, rebirth, and, karmic, retribution, through, spiritual, knowledge, among, the, buddhist, sites, currently, found, in, the, magadha, region, include, two, unesco, world, heritage, sites, such, as, the, mahabodhi, temple, at, bodh, gaya, and, the, nalanda, monastery, the, mahabodhi, temple, is, one, of, the, most, important, places, of, pilgrimage, in, the, buddhist, world, and, is, said, to, mark, the, site, where, the, buddha, attained, enlightenment, beginning, in, the, theravada, commentaries, the, pali, language, has, been, identified, with, magahi, the, language, of, the, kingdom, of, magadha, and, this, was, taken, to, also, be, the, language, that, the, buddha, used, during, his, life, in, the, 19th, century, the, british, orientalist, robert, caesar, childers, argued, that, the, true, or, geographical, name, of, the, pali, language, was, magadhi, prakrit, and, that, because, p, i, means, line, row, series, the, early, buddhists, extended, the, meaning, of, the, term, to, mean, a, series, of, books, so, p, ibh, s, means, language, of, the, texts, nonetheless, pali, does, retain, some, eastern, features, that, have, been, referred, to, as, m, gadhisms, magadhi, prakrit, was, one, of, the, three, dramatic, prakrits, to, emerge, following, the, decline, of, sanskrit, it, was, spoken, in, magadha, and, neighbouring, regions, and, later, evolved, into, modern, eastern, indo, aryan, languages, like, magahi, maithili, and, bhojpuri, the, history, of, magadha, region, is, very, vast, it, can, be, divided, into, many, periods, as, there, is, much, uncertainty, about, the, succession, of, kings, and, the, precise, chronology, of, magadha, prior, to, mahapadma, nanda, the, accounts, of, various, ancient, texts, all, of, which, were, written, many, centuries, later, than, the, era, in, question, contradict, each, other, on, many, points, two, notable, rulers, of, magadha, were, bimbisara, also, known, as, shrenika, and, his, son, ajatashatru, also, known, as, kunika, who, are, mentioned, in, buddhist, and, jain, literature, as, contemporaries, of, the, buddha, and, mahavira, later, the, throne, of, magadha, was, usurped, by, mahapadma, nanda, the, founder, of, the, nanda, dynasty, c, 345, c, 322, bce, which, conquered, much, of, north, india, the, nanda, dynasty, was, overthrown, by, chandragupta, maurya, the, founder, of, the, maurya, empire, c, 322, 185, bce, furthermore, there, is, a, long, chronology, and, a, contrasting, short, chronology, preferred, by, some, scholars, an, issue, that, is, inextricably, linked, to, the, uncertain, chronology, of, the, buddha, and, mahavira, according, to, historian, k, t, s, sarao, a, proponent, of, the, short, chronology, wherein, the, buddha, s, lifespan, was, c, 477, 397, bce, it, can, be, estimated, that, bimbisara, was, reigning, c, 457, 405, bce, and, ajatashatru, was, reigning, c, 405, 373, bce, according, to, historian, john, keay, a, proponent, of, the, long, chronology, bimbisara, must, have, been, reigning, in, the, late, 5th, century, bce, and, ajatashatru, in, the, early, 4th, century, bce, keay, states, that, there, is, great, uncertainty, about, the, royal, succession, after, ajatashatru, s, death, probably, because, there, was, a, period, of, court, intrigues, and, murders, during, which, evidently, the, throne, changed, hands, frequently, perhaps, with, more, than, one, incumbent, claiming, to, occupy, it, at, the, same, time, until, mahapadma, nanda, was, able, to, secure, the, throne, the, following, long, chronology, is, according, to, the, buddhist, mahavamsa, the, hindu, literature, mostly, puranas, give, a, different, sequence, a, shorter, list, appears, in, the, jain, tradition, which, simply, lists, shrenika, bimbisara, kunika, ajatashatru, udayin, followed, by, the, nanda, dynasty, important, people, from, the, region, of, magadha, include, indo, scythians, indo, parthians, references, sources
