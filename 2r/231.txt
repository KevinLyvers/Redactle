the, crusader, states, or, outremer, were, four, catholic, polities, that, existed, in, the, levant, from, 1098, to, 1291, following, the, principles, of, feudalism, the, foundation, for, these, polities, was, laid, by, the, first, crusade, which, was, proclaimed, by, the, latin, church, in, 1095, in, order, to, reclaim, the, holy, land, after, it, was, lost, to, the, 7th, century, muslim, conquest, situated, on, the, eastern, mediterranean, the, four, states, were, in, order, from, north, to, south, the, county, of, edessa, 1098, 1150, the, principality, of, antioch, 1098, 1268, the, county, of, tripoli, 1102, 1289, and, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, 1099, 1291, the, three, northern, states, covered, an, area, in, what, is, now, southeastern, turkey, northwestern, syria, and, northern, lebanon, and, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, the, southernmost, and, most, prominent, state, covered, an, area, in, what, is, now, israel, palestine, southern, lebanon, and, western, jordan, the, description, crusader, states, can, be, misleading, as, from, 1130, onwards, very, few, people, among, the, franks, were, crusaders, medieval, and, modern, writers, use, the, term, outremer, as, a, synonym, derived, from, the, french, word, for, overseas, by, 1098, the, crusaders, armed, pilgrimage, to, jerusalem, was, passing, through, the, syria, region, edessa, under, the, rule, of, greek, orthodoxy, was, subject, to, a, coup, d, tat, in, which, the, leadership, was, taken, over, by, baldwin, of, boulogne, and, bohemond, of, taranto, remained, as, the, ruling, prince, in, the, captured, city, of, antioch, the, siege, of, jerusalem, in, 1099, resulted, in, a, decisive, crusader, victory, over, the, fatimid, caliphate, after, which, territorial, consolidation, followed, including, the, taking, of, tripoli, in, 1144, edessa, fell, to, the, zengid, turks, but, the, other, three, realms, endured, until, the, final, years, of, the, 13th, century, when, they, fell, to, the, mamluk, sultanate, of, egypt, the, mamluks, captured, antioch, in, 1268, and, tripoli, in, 1289, leaving, only, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, which, had, been, severely, weakened, by, the, ayyubid, sultanate, after, the, siege, of, jerusalem, in, 1244, the, crusader, presence, in, the, levant, collapsed, shortly, thereafter, when, the, mamluks, captured, acre, in, 1291, ending, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, nearly, 200, years, after, it, was, founded, with, all, four, of, the, states, defeated, and, annexed, the, survivors, fled, to, the, kingdom, of, cyprus, which, had, been, established, by, the, third, crusade, the, study, of, the, crusader, states, in, their, own, right, as, opposed, to, being, a, sub, topic, of, the, crusades, began, in, 19th, century, france, as, an, analogy, to, the, french, colonial, experience, in, the, levant, though, this, was, rejected, by, 20th, century, historians, their, consensus, was, that, the, frankish, population, as, the, western, europeans, were, known, at, the, time, lived, as, a, minority, society, that, was, largely, urban, and, isolated, from, the, indigenous, levantine, peoples, having, separate, legal, and, religious, systems, the, ancient, jewish, communities, that, had, survived, and, remained, in, the, holy, cities, of, jerusalem, tiberias, hebron, and, safed, since, the, jewish, roman, wars, and, the, destruction, of, the, second, temple, were, heavily, persecuted, in, a, pattern, of, rampant, christian, antisemitism, accompanying, the, crusades, the, terms, crusader, states, and, outremer, french, outre, mer, lit,

antioch, the, county, of, tripoli, and, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, the, term, outremer, is, of, medieval, origin, whilst, modern, historians, use, crusader, states, and, the, term, franks, for, the, european, incomers, however, relatively, few, of, the, incoming, europeans, took, a, crusader, oath, the, latin, chronicles, of, the, first, crusade, written, in, the, early, 11th, century, called,

this, reflected, that, only, latins, held, complete, political, and, legal, rights, in, the, kingdom, and, that, the, major, division, in, the, society, was, not, between, the, nobility, and, the,

barkiyaruq, for, help, but, he, was, engaged, in, a, power, struggle, with, his, brother, muhammad, tapar, at, antioch, bohemond, persuaded, the, other, leaders, the, city, should, be, his, if, he, could, capture, it, and, alexios, did, not, come, to, claim, it, alexios, withdrew, rather, than, join, the, siege, after, stephen, count, of, blois, who, was, deserting, told, him, defeat, was, imminent, in, june, 1098, bohemond, persuaded, a, renegade, armenian, tower, commander, to, let, the, crusaders, into, the, city, they, slaughtered, the, muslim, inhabitants, and, by, mistake, some, local, christians, the, crusade, leaders, decided, to, return, antioch, to, alexios, as, they, had, sworn, to, at, constantinople, but, when, they, learnt, of, alexios, withdrawal, bohemond, claimed, the, city, for, himself, the, other, leaders, agreed, apart, from, raymond, who, supported, the, byzantine, alliance, this, dispute, resulted, in, the, march, stalling, in, north, syria, the,

after, the, truce, expired, in, 1182, saladin, demonstrated, the, strategic, advantage, he, had, by, holding, both, cairo, and, damascus, while, he, faced, baldwin, in, oultrejordain, his, troops, from, syria, pillaged, galilee, the, franks, adopted, a, defensive, tactic, and, strengthened, their, fortresses, in, february, 1183, a, jerusalemite, assembly, levied, an, extraordinary, tax, for,

jerusalem, s, royal, administration, was, based, in, the, city, until, it, was, lost, and, then, in, acre, it, featured, the, typical, household, officers, of, most, european, rulers, a, cleric, led, chancery, constable, marshal, chamberlain, chancellor, seneschal, and, butler, royal, territory, was, directly, administered, by, viscounts, all, tangible, evidence, of, the, written, law, was, lost, in, 1187, when, the, franks, lost, the, city, of, jerusalem, to, the, muslims, the, courts, of, the, princes, of, antioch, were, similar, and, created, the, italo, norman, laws, that, were, also, later, adopted, by, cilician, armenia, known, as, the, assizes, of, antioch, these, have, survived, in, 13th, century, armenian, translations, relationships, among, antioch, s, various, frankish, syrian, greek, jewish, armenian, and, muslim, inhabitants, were, generally, good, the, brief, existence, of, the, uniquely, landlocked, edessa, means, it, is, the, least, studied, but, its, history, is, traceable, to, armenian, and, syriac, chronicles, in, addition, to, latin, sources, like, jerusalem, the, political, institutions, appear, to, have, reflected, the, northern, french, roots, of, the, founders, although, the, membership, of, city, councils, included, indigenous, christians, the, population, was, diverse, including, armenian, orthodox, greeks, known, as, melkites, syrian, orthodox, known, as, jacobites, and, muslims, in, tripoli, the, fourth, frankish, state, raymond, of, saint, gilles, and, his, successors, ruled, directly, over, several, towns, granting, the, rest, as, fiefs, to, lords, originating, in, languedoc, and, provence, and, gibelet, was, given, to, the, genoese, in, return, for, naval, support, in, the, 12th, century, this, system, provided, a, total, of, 300, knights, a, much, smaller, army, than, antioch, or, jerusalem, architectural, and, artistic, activity, in, lebanese, churches, provide, evidence, that, the, indigenous, populations, prospered, under, frankish, rule, in, part, due, to, its, remoteness, from, the, worst, impacts, of, saladin, s, conquests, in, 1187, 1188, these, were, arabic, speaking, melkites, monophysites, nestorians, syrians, and, large, numbers, of, syriac, speaking, maronites, with, their, own, clerical, hierarchies, the, greek, orthodox, church, was, restricted, as, in, jerusalem, there, were, similar, self, governing, muslim, communities, of, druze, and, alawites, including, isma, ili, in, the, frontier, areas, to, the, north, the, multi, ethnic, structure, may, well, have, been, more, pronounced, in, tripoli, and, in, the, 12th, century, there, may, have, been, a, southern, french, culture, although, this, characteristic, faded, over, time, the, king, of, jerusalem, s, foremost, role, was, as, leader, of, the, feudal, host, during, the, near, constant, warfare, in, the, early, decades, of, the, 12th, century, the, kings, rarely, awarded, land, or, lordships, and, those, they, did, frequently, became, vacant, and, reverted, to, the, crown, because, of, the, high, mortality, rate, their, followers, loyalty, was, rewarded, with, city, incomes, through, this, the, domain, of, the, first, five, rulers, was, larger, than, the, combined, holdings, of, the, nobility, these, kings, of, jerusalem, had, greater, internal, power, than, comparative, western, monarchs, but, they, lacked, the, personnel, and, administrative, systems, necessary, to, govern, such, a, large, realm, in, the, second, quarter, of, the, century, magnates, like, raynald, of, ch, tillon, lord, of, oultrejordain, and, raymond, iii, count, of, tripoli, prince, of, galilee, established, baronial, dynasties, and, often, acted, as, autonomous, rulers, royal, powers, were, done, away, with, and, governance, was, undertaken, within, the, feudatories, the, remaining, central, control, was, exercised, at, the, high, court, or, haute, cour, which, was, also, known, in, latin, as, curia, generalis, and, curia, regis, or, in, vernacular, french, as, parlement, these, meetings, were, between, king, and, tenants, in, chief, the, duty, of, the, vassal, to, give, counsel, developed, into, a, privilege, and, then, the, monarch, s, legitimacy, depended, on, the, court, s, agreement, the, high, court, was, the, great, barons, and, the, king, s, direct, vassals, it, had, a, quorum, of, the, king, and, three, tenants, in, chief, in, 1162, the, assise, sur, la, ligece, roughly, assize, on, liege, homage, expanded, the, court, s, membership, to, all, 600, or, more, fief, holders, those, paying, direct, homage, to, the, king, became, members, of, the, haute, cour, by, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, they, were, joined, by, the, leaders, of, the, military, orders, and, in, the, 13th, century, the, italian, communes, the, leaders, of, the, third, crusade, ignored, the, monarchy, the, kings, of, england, and, france, agreed, on, the, division, of, future, conquests, as, if, there, was, no, need, to, consider, the, local, nobility, prawer, felt, the, weakness, of, the, crown, of, jerusalem, was, demonstrated, by, the, rapid, offering, of, the, throne, to, conrad, of, montferrat, in, 1190, and, then, henry, ii, count, of, champagne, in, 1192, although, this, was, given, legal, effect, by, baldwin, iv, s, will, stipulating, if, baldwin, v, died, a, minor, the, pope, the, kings, of, england, and, france, and, the, holy, roman, emperor, would, decide, the, succession, prior, to, the, 1187, defeat, at, hattin, laws, developed, by, the, court, were, recorded, as, assises, in, letters, of, the, holy, sepulchre, all, written, law, was, lost, in, the, fall, of, jerusalem, the, legal, system, was, now, largely, based, on, custom, and, the, memory, of, the, lost, legislation, the, renowned, jurist, philip, of, novara, lamented, we, know, rather, poorly, for, they, are, known, by, hearsay, and, usage, and, we, think, an, assize, is, something, we, have, seen, as, an, assize, in, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, made, much, better, use, of, the, laws, and, acted, on, them, more, surely, before, the, land, was, lost, an, idyllic, view, of, the, early, 12th, century, legal, system, was, created, the, barons, reinterpreted, the, assise, sur, la, ligece, which, almalric, i, intended, to, strengthen, the, crown, to, constrain, the, monarch, instead, particularly, regarding, the, monarch, s, right, to, confiscate, feudal, fiefs, without, trial, the, loss, of, the, vast, majority, of, rural, fiefs, led, the, baronage, to, evolve, into, an, urban, mercantile, class, where, knowledge, of, the, law, was, a, valuable, well, regarded, skill, and, a, career, path, to, higher, status, after, hattin, the, franks, lost, their, cities, lands, and, churches, barons, fled, to, cyprus, and, intermarried, with, leading, new, emigres, from, the, lusignan, montb, liard, brienne, and, montfort, families, this, created, a, separate, class, the, remnants, of, the, old, nobility, with, a, limited, understanding, of, the, latin, east, this, included, the, king, consorts, guy, conrad, henry, aimery, john, and, the, absent, hohenstaufen, dynasty, that, followed, the, barons, of, jerusalem, in, the, 13th, century, have, been, poorly, regarded, by, both, contemporary, and, modern, commentators, their, superficial, rhetoric, disgusted, jacques, de, vitry, riley, smith, writes, of, their, pedantry, and, the, use, of, spurious, legal, justification, for, political, action, the, barons, valued, this, ability, to, articulate, the, law, this, is, evidenced, by, the, elaborate, and, impressive, treatises, of, the, baronial, jurists, from, the, second, half, of, the, 13th, century, from, may, 1229, when, frederick, ii, left, the, holy, land, to, defend, his, italian, and, german, lands, monarchs, were, absent, conrad, was, titular, king, from, 1225, until, 1254, and, his, son, conradin, until, 1268, when, charles, of, anjou, executed, him, the, monarchy, of, jerusalem, had, limited, power, in, comparison, with, the, west, where, rulers, developed, bureaucratic, machinery, for, administration, jurisdiction, and, legislation, through, which, they, exercised, control, in, 1242, the, barons, prevailed, and, appointed, a, succession, of, ibelin, and, cypriot, regents, centralised, government, collapsed, in, the, face, of, independence, exercised, by, the, nobility, military, orders, and, italian, communes, the, three, cypriot, lusignan, kings, who, succeeded, lacked, the, resources, to, recover, the, lost, territory, one, claimant, sold, the, title, of, king, to, charles, of, anjou, he, gained, power, for, a, short, while, but, never, visited, the, kingdom, all, estimates, of, the, size, of, frankish, and, muslim, armies, are, uncertain, existing, accounts, indicate, that, it, is, probable, that, the, franks, of, outremer, raised, the, largest, armies, in, the, catholic, world, as, early, as, 1111, the, four, crusader, states, fielded, 16, 000, troops, to, launch, a, joint, military, campaign, against, shaizar, edessa, and, tripoli, raised, armies, numbering, 1, 000, 3, 000, troops, antioch, and, jerusalem, deployed, 4, 000, 6, 000, soldiers, in, comparison, william, the, conqueror, commanded, 5, 000, 7, 000, troops, at, hastings, and, 12, 000, crusaders, fought, against, the, moors, at, las,

atabegs, commanded, 2, 000, 5, 000, troops, the, artuqids, could, hire, as, many, as, 30, 000, turks, but, these, nomadic, warriors, were, unfit, for, lengthy, sieges, after, uniting, egypt, syria, and, much, of, iraq, saladin, raised, armies, around, 20, 000, strong, egyptian, money, and, syrian, manpower, represented, the, two, critical, factors, underpinning, saladin, s, military, might, during, the, period, in, response, the, franks, quickly, increased, their, military, force, up, to, around, 18, 000, troops, by, 1183, but, not, without, implementing, austerity, measures, in, the, 13th, century, the, control, of, acre, s, lucrative, commerce, provided, the, resources, to, maintain, sizeable, armies, at, la, forbie, 16, 000, frankish, warriors, perished, in, the, battlefield, but, this, was, the, last, occasion, when, a, united, jerusalemite, army, fought, a, pitched, battle, during, the, 1291, siege, of, acre, about, 15, 000, frankish, troops, defended, the, city, against, more, than, 60, 000, mamluk, warriors, the, crusader, states, military, power, depended, mainly, on, four, major, categories, of, soldiery, vassals, mercenaries, visitors, from, the, west, and, troops, provided, by, the, military, orders, vassals, were, expected, to, perform, their, military, duties, in, person, as, fully, armed, knights, or, more, lightly, armoured, serjants, unmarried, female, fief, holders, had, to, hire, mercenaries, their, wards, represented, underage, vassals, disabled, men, and, men, over, sixty, were, required, to, cede, their, horses, and, arms, to, their, lords, vassals, who, owed, the, service, of, more, than, one, soldier, had, to, mobilise, their, own, vassals, or, employ, mercenaries, a, feudal, lord, s, army, could, be, sizeable, for, example, 60, cavalrymen, and, 100, footmen, accompanied, richard, of, salerno, then, lord, of, marash, during, a, joint, antiochene, edessene, campaign, against, mawdud, in, 1111, complaints, about, frankish, rulers, difficulties, in, paying, off, their, troops, abound, showing, the, importance, of, mercenary, troops, in, levantine, warfare, mercenaries, were, hired, regularly, for, military, campaigns, for, garrisoning, forts, and, particularly, in, antioch, for, serving, in, the, prince, s, armed, retinue, the, crusader, states, could, have, hardly, survived, without, constant, support, from, the, west, armed, pilgrims, arriving, at, moments, of, crisis, could, save, the, day, like, those, who, landed, just, after, baldwin, i, s, defeat, at, ramla, in, 1102, westerners, were, unwilling, to, accept, the, frankish, leaders, authority, the, military, orders, emerged, as, a, new, form, of, religious, organisation, in, response, to, the, unstable, conditions, at, western, christendom, s, borderlands, the, first, of, them, the, knights, templar, developed, from, a, knightly, brotherhood, attached, to, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, around, 1119, the, knights, took, the, monastic, vows, of, chastity, poverty, and, obedience, and, committed, themselves, to, the, armed, protection, of, pilgrims, visiting, jerusalem, this, unusual, combination, of, monastic, and, knightly, ideas, did, not, meet, with, general, approval, but, the, templars, found, an, influential, protector, in, the, prominent, cistercian, abbot, bernard, of, clairvaux, their, monastic, rule, was, confirmed, at, the, council, of, troyes, in, france, in, 1129, the, name, derives, from, solomon, s, temple, the, frankish, name, for, the, al, aqsa, mosque, where, they, established, their, first, headquarters, the, templars, commitment, to, the, defence, of, fellow, christians, proved, an, attractive, idea, stimulating, the, establishment, of, new, military, orders, in, outremer, always, by, the, militarisation, of, charitable, organisations, the, hospitallers, represents, the, earliest, example, originally, a, nursing, confraternity, at, a, jerusalemite, hospital, founded, by, merchants, from, amalfi, they, assumed, military, functions, in, the, 1130s, three, further, military, orders, followed, in, the, levant, the, order, of, saint, lazarus, mainly, for, leper, knights, in, the, 1130s, the, german, order, of, teutonic, knights, in, 1198, and, the, english, order, of, st, thomas, of, acre, in, 1228, as, frequent, beneficiaries, of, pious, donations, across, europe, and, the, levant, the, hospitallers, templars, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, teutonic, knights, accumulated, considerable, wealth, they, administered, their, scattered, estates, through, an, extensive, network, of, branch, houses, each, required, to, transfer, a, part, generally, one, third, of, its, revenues, to, the, jerusalemite, headquarters, as, the, regular, transfer, of, goods, and, money, required, the, development, of, complex, logistical, and, financial, systems, the, three, orders, operated, as, early, forms, of, supranational, trading, houses, and, credit, institutions, their, networks, facilitated, international, money, transfers, because, funds, deposited, in, a, branch, could, be, paid, out, in, another, and, loans, granted, in, one, country, could, be, repaid, in, another, the, hospitallers, never, abandoned, charitable, work, in, jerusalem, their, hospital, served, hundreds, of, patients, of, all, religions, and, genders, pilgrims, pregnant, women, abandoned, children, and, impoverished, people, could, also, enlist, their, aid, however, waging, war, against, infidels, remained, the, military, orders, prime, obligation, as, an, early, example, of, a, standing, army, they, had, a, pivotal, role, in, the, crusader, states, defence, the, knight, brothers, and, their, armed, servants, were, professional, soldiers, under, monastic, vows, they, wore, a, habit, always, with, a, cross, on, it, and, showing, its, wearer, s, rank, as, lay, rulers, and, aristocrats, seldom, had, the, funds, to, cover, all, costs, of, border, defence, they, eagerly, ceded, their, border, forts, to, the, military, orders, the, earliest, examples, include, beth, gibelin, in, jerusalem, and, krak, des, chevaliers, in, tripoli, both, seized, by, the, hospitallers, companies, of, highly, trained, mounted, knights, made, up, the, central, element, of, frankish, armies, their, military, expertise, and, outstanding, unit, cohesion, distinguished, them, from, the, byzantine, and, muslim, heavy, cavalry, frankish, foot, soldiers, were, disciplined, to, cooperate, closely, with, the, knights, and, to, defend, them, against, attacks, by, the, turkic, light, cavalry, the, frankish, armies, distinctive, feature, was, the, extensive, deployment, of, foot, soldiers, equipped, with, crossbows, muslim, commanders, employed, crossbowmen, almost, exclusively, in, a, siege, situation, native, christians, and, converted, turks, along, with, some, franks, served, as, lightly, armoured, cavalrymen, called, turcopoles, they, were, positioned, to, fight, against, the, turkic, light, cavalry, and, were, well, suited, for, raids, the, frankish, knights, fought, in, close, order, formation, and, applied, tactics, to, enhance, the, impact, of, a, cavalry, charge, examples, include, surprise, attacks, at, dawn, and, chasing, herds, of, cattle, towards, an, enemy, camp, during, a, frankish, cavalry, charge, the, muslim, troops, attempted, to, avoid, a, direct, clash, until, the, knights, were, separated, from, the, infantry, and, their, horses, became, exhausted, frankish, foot, soldiers, could, create, a, shield, roof, against, the, rain, of, turkish, arrows, feigned, retreat, was, a, tactic, used, by, both, muslim, and, frankish, troops, although, christian, chroniclers, considered, it, shameful, in, a, siege, situation, the, franks, avoided, direct, assaults, instead, they, imposed, a, blockade, on, the, besieged, town, and, starved, the, defenders, into, submission, by, contrast, muslim, commanders, preferred, direct, attacks, as, they, could, easily, muster, new, troops, to, replace, those, who, had, perished, both, sides, employed, similar, siege, engines, including, wooden, siege, towers, battering, rams, mangonels, and, from, the, 1150s, large, trebuchets, the, extensive, use, of, carrier, pigeons, and, signal, fires, was, an, important, element, of, muslim, warfare, as, muslim, commanders, were, informed, of, the, franks, movements, in, time, they, could, intercept, frankish, invaders, unexpectedly, in, comparison, with, contemporaneous, europe, battles, were, not, uncommon, in, outremer, the, franks, fought, battles, mainly, in, defensive, situations, they, adopted, delaying, tactics, only, when, they, obviously, had, no, chance, to, defeat, a, large, invading, force, like, during, saladin, s, invasion, of, antioch, in, 1187, and, mamluk, attacks, against, outremer, in, the, 1260s, while, on, the, offensive, the, franks, typically, risked, pitched, battles, if, they, could, gain, substantial, territory, and, a, local, faction, supported, their, campaign, as, the, franks, were, unable, to, absorb, casualties, as, effectively, as, their, enemies, a, defeat, in, a, major, battle, could, put, the, very, existence, of, a, crusader, state, at, risk, examples, include, the, shrinking, of, antiochene, territory, after, the, defeat, of, an, antiochene, edessene, coalition, at, the, battle, of, harran, in, 1104, and, the, territorial, consequences, of, saladin, s, triumph, at, hattin, from, the, 1150s, observers, like, the, chroniclers, michael, the, syrian, and, ali, ibn, al, athir, concluded, that, the, franks, military, skills, had, weakened, in, fact, the, franks, could, still, launch, long, distance, campaigns, against, egypt, and, resist, enemy, attacks, without, adequate, provisions, for, days, consequently, as, historian, nicholas, morton, proposes, their, defeats, could, more, likely, be, attributed, to, their, enemies, flexibility, the, muslims, had, learnt, how, to, solve, their, own, shortcomings, and, take, advantage, of, the, franks, weaknesses, muslim, rulers, intensified, jih, d, propaganda, to, curb, ethnic, tensions, while, disputes, between, frankish, and, western, commanders, prevented, their, effective, cooperation, the, muslim, commanders, adopted, new, tactics, against, the, heavily, armoured, knights, like, the, sudden, division, of, their, ranks, during, a, cavalry, charge, in, contrast, the, franks, could, not, compete, with, their, enemies, swiftness, in, a, siege, situation, they, insisted, on, the, deployment, of, siege, towers, although, a, tower, s, construction, lasted, for, four, to, six, weeks, and, during, this, period, relief, forces, could, reach, the, besieged, town, or, fortress, by, contrast, the, muslims, preferred, quick, mining, operations, like, digging, under, ramparts, or, burning, walls, without, solid, documentary, basis, modern, calculations, about, the, size, of, the, crusader, states, population, are, only, guesswork, medieval, chronicles, contain, demographic, data, but, they, mostly, present, exaggerated, numbers, without, differentiating, franks, and, native, christians, calculations, about, the, population, of, a, town, are, based, on, reports, of, a, siege, when, refugees, from, nearby, villages, had, multiplied, it, estimations, of, the, number, of, franks, in, outremer, range, between, 120, 000, and, 300, 000, if, these, numbers, are, credible, franks, made, up, at, least, 15, of, the, crusader, states, total, population, in, context, josiah, russell, estimates, the, population, of, what, he, calls, islamic, territory, as, roughly, 12, 5, million, in, 1000, anatolia, 8, million, syria, 2, million, egypt, 1, 5, million, and, north, africa, 1, million, with, the, european, areas, that, provided, crusaders, having, a, population, of, 23, 7, million, he, estimates, that, by, 1200, these, figures, had, risen, to, 13, 7, million, in, islamic, territory, anatolia, 7, million, syria, 2, 7, million, egypt, 2, 5, million, and, north, africa, 1, 5, million, while, the, crusaders, home, countries, population, was, 35, 6, million, russell, also, acknowledges, that, much, of, anatolia, was, christian, or, under, the, byzantines, and, that, some, purportedly, islamic, areas, such, as, mosul, and, baghdad, also, had, significant, christian, populations, immigration, from, catholic, europe, was, continuous, till, the, end, of, the, crusader, states, although, most, colonists, settled, in, the, coastal, cities, the, franks, presence, is, documented, in, more, than, 200, villages, about, 15, of, all, rural, settlements, in, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, some, frankish, rural, settlements, were, planned, villages, established, to, encourage, settlers, from, the, west, some, were, shared, with, native, christians, the, native, jewish, population, was, concentrated, in, the, four, holy, cities, of, jerusalem, hebron, safed, and, tiberias, from, the, late, 12th, century, refugees, from, territories, lost, to, the, muslims, increased, the, christian, population, of, the, coastal, cities, but, emigration, to, cyprus, or, frankish, greece, can, also, be, detected, the, expansion, of, the, urban, population, is, most, obvious, at, acre, where, a, new, suburb, developed, following, the, third, crusade, emigration, from, outremer, intensified, from, the, 1240s, as, prospects, of, the, crusader, states, survival, darkened, in, this, period, a, massive, influx, of, frankish, and, native, christian, refugees, to, cyprus, is, well, documented, franks, who, did, not, flee, could, survive, the, mamluk, conquest, as, slaves, or, renegades, a, franciscan, friar, met, with, frankish, prisoners, of, war, and, converts, to, islam, at, acre, more, than, a, decade, after, the, fall, of, the, city, immigration, from, jewish, communities, in, europe, also, increased, from, this, period, due, to, the, travel, routes, having, been, opened, up, by, christian, pilgrims, for, example, in, 1211, hundreds, of, rabbis, immigrated, to, the, crusader, state, modern, research, indicates, that, jews, muslims, and, local, christian, populations, were, less, integrated, than, previously, thought, christians, lived, around, jerusalem, and, in, an, arc, stretching, from, jericho, and, the, jordan, river, to, hebron, in, the, south, comparisons, of, archaeological, evidence, of, byzantine, churches, built, prior, to, the, muslim, conquest, and, 16th, century, ottoman, census, records, shows, some, greek, orthodox, communities, disappeared, before, the, crusades, but, most, continued, during, and, for, centuries, after, maronites, were, concentrated, in, tripoli, jacobites, in, antioch, and, edessa, armenians, were, concentrated, in, the, north, but, communities, existed, in, all, major, towns, central, areas, had, a, predominantly, sunni, muslim, population, but, shi, ite, communities, existed, in, galilee, muslim, druze, lived, in, the, mountains, of, tripoli, jews, lived, in, coastal, towns, and, some, galilean, towns, and, in, the, holy, cities, jerusalem, safed, hebron, and, tiberias, little, research, has, been, done, on, islamic, conversion, but, the, available, evidence, led, ellenblum, to, believe, that, around, nablus, and, jerusalem, christians, remained, a, majority, most, of, the, indigenous, population, were, peasants, living, off, the, land, charters, from, the, early, 12th, century, show, evidence, of, the, donation, of, local, villeins, free, serfs, to, nobles, and,

it, is, unknown, whether, the, mosaic, work, was, done, by, indigenous, craftsmen, or, learnt, by, frankish, ones, but, it, shows, the, evolution, of, a, distinctive, and, original, artistic, style,

spain, and, the, hybrid, culture, of, sicily, there, is, no, written, evidence, that, the, franks, or, local, christians, recognised, significant, religious, differences, until, the, 13th, century, when, the, jurists, used, phrases, like, men, not, of, the, rule, of, rome, the, crusaders, filled, greek, orthodox, ecclesiastical, positions, that, became, vacant, such, as, on, the, death, of, simeon, ii, when, the, frank, arnulf, of, chocques, succeeded, him, as, patriarch, of, jerusalem, the, appointment, of, latin, bishops, had, little, effect, on, the, arabic, speaking, orthodox,

previously, been, a, bishopric, the, greek, and, syrian, population, was, given, to, the, care, of, meletos, bishop, of, eleutheropolis, thus, meletos, also, acted, as, the, recognised, bishop, of,

discriminated, in, civil, and, intercommunal, law, and, had, to, pay, a, poll, tax, capit, ti, muslims, were, marginalised, from, townlife, but, muslim, villagers, under, crusader, dominion, seem, to, have, fared, equally, well, as, or, perhaps, better, than, their, counterparts, in, muslim, lands, and, bedouins, had, a, privileged, status, some, mosques, were, converted, into, latin, christian, churches, especially, larger, ones, but, most, remained, in, muslim, possession, and, sometimes, muslims, could, pray, in, portions, of, erstwhile, mosques, in, certain, places, one, such, personally, experienced, episode, is, described, by, usama, ibn, munqidh, in, the, early, 1140s, there, was, no, forced, conversion, of, muslims, as, this, would, end, peasants, servile, status, moreover, crusaders, generally, showed, no, interest, in, converting, jews, muslims, or, miaphysites, to, latin, christianity, followers, of, different, religions, also, could, engage, in, shared, forms, of, folk, religion, like, at, the, cave, of, the, patriarchs, where, the, cultic, site, had, however, been, divided, the, franks, habitual, following, of, the, customs, of, their, western, european, homeland, meant, that, they, made, few, lasting, innovations, three, notable, exceptions, were, the, military, orders, warfare, innovations, and, fortification, developments, no, major, european, poet, theologian, scholar, or, historian, settled, in, the, region, though, new, imagery, and, ideas, in, western, european, poetry, can, be, traced, to, some, who, visited, as, pilgrims, although, they, did, not, migrate, east, themselves, their, output, often, encouraged, others, to, journey, there, on, pilgrimage, historians, believe, the, crusader, military, architecture, demonstrates, a, synthesis, of, the, european, byzantine, and, muslim, traditions, and, that, it, is, the, most, impressive, artistic, achievement, of, the, crusades, after, acre, fell, the, hospitallers, relocated, first, to, cyprus, then, conquered, and, ruled, rhodes, 1309, 1522, and, malta, 1530, 1798, the, sovereign, military, order, of, malta, survives, to, the, present, day, philip, iv, of, france, probably, had, financial, and, political, reasons, to, oppose, the, knights, templar, he, exerted, pressure, on, pope, clement, v, who, responded, in, 1312, by, dissolving, the, order, on, probably, false, grounds, of, sodomy, magic, and, heresy, the, raising, transportation, and, supply, of, armies, led, to, flourishing, trade, between, europe, and, the, crusader, states, the, italian, city, states, of, genoa, and, venice, flourished, through, profitable, trading, communes, many, historians, argue, that, the, interaction, between, western, christian, and, islamic, cultures, was, a, significant, and, ultimately, positive, influence, on, the, development, of, european, civilisation, and, the, renaissance, relations, between, europeans, and, the, islamic, world, stretched, across, the, length, of, the, mediterranean, sea, making, it, difficult, for, historians, to, identify, what, proportion, of, cultural, cross, fertilisation, originated, in, the, crusader, states, sicily, and, spain, in, the, 19th, century, the, crusader, states, became, a, subject, of, study, distinct, from, the, crusades, particularly, in, france, joseph, fran, ois, michaud, s, influential,

of, a, society, that, was, predominantly, urban, isolated, from, the, indigenous, peoples, with, separate, legal, and, religious, systems, prawer, s, 1972, work, the, latin, kingdom, of, jerusalem,

disenfranchised, local, population, the, franks, primary, motivations, were, economic, islamic, historian, carole, hillenbrand, argued, that, the, islamic, population, responded, with, resentment, suspicion, and, rejection, of, the, franks, recently, this, has, been, challenged, by, historians, such, as, ronnie, ellenblum, using, archaeological, research, but, no, alternative, model, has, been, accepted, christopher, tyerman, points, out, this, is, not, a, return, to, older, theories, as, the, same, sources, are, used, and, the, archaeology, is, unprovable, specialist, denys, pringle, notes, that, it, does, not, contradict, the, earlier, view, hans, eberhard, mayer, had, already, advised, that, the, number, of, franks, living, in, rural, settlements, should, not, be, underestimated, these, theories, support, the, idea, that, the, crusader, states, formed, part, of, the, wider, expansion, of, western, europe, driven, by, religious, reform, and, growing, papal, power, however, historians, argue, there, was, no, vigorous, church, reform, in, the, east, or, resulting, persecution, of, jews, and, heretics, some, consider, regulations, from, the, 1120, council, of, nablus, as, exceptional, and, benjamin, z, kedar, believed, they, followed, byzantine, rather, than, western, reformist, precedent, the, debate, has, led, historians, like, claude, cahen, jean, richard, and, christopher, macevitt, to, argue, the, history, of, the, crusader, states, is, distinct, from, the, crusades, allowing, the, application, of, other, analytical, techniques, that, place, the, crusader, states, in, the, context, of, near, eastern, politics, these, ideas, are, still, in, the, process, of, articulation, by, modern, historians
