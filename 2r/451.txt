the, moon, including, both, crewed, and, robotic, missions, the, first, human, made, object, to, touch, the, moon, was, luna, 2, in, 1959, in, 1969, apollo, 11, was, the, first, crewed, mission, to, land, on, the, moon, there, were, six, crewed, landings, between, 1969, and, 1972, and, numerous, uncrewed, landings, all, crewed, missions, to, the, moon, were, conducted, by, the, apollo, program, with, the, last, departing, the, lunar, surface, in, december, 1972, after, luna, 24, in, 1976, there, were, no, soft, landings, on, the, moon, until, chang, e, 3, in, 2013, all, soft, landings, took, place, on, the, near, side, of, the, moon, until, january, 2019, when, chang, e, 4, made, the, first, landing, on, the, far, side, of, the, moon, six, government, space, agencies, interkosmos, nasa, cnsa, isro, jaxa, and, esa, have, reached, the, moon, with, uncrewed, missions, three, private, commercial, missions, beresheet, hard, landing, hakuto, r, hard, landing, and, odysseus, soft, landing, have, also, reached, the, lunar, surface, see, commercial, landings, the, soviet, union, interkosmos, the, united, states, nasa, china, cnsa, india, isro, and, japan, jaxa, are, the, only, five, nations, to, have, successfully, achieved, soft, landings, the, soviet, union, performed, the, first, hard, moon, landing, hard, meaning, the, spacecraft, intentionally, crashes, into, the, moon, at, high, speeds, with, the, luna, 2, spacecraft, in, 1959, a, feat, the, u, s, duplicated, in, 1962, with, ranger, 4, following, their, initial, hard, landings, on, the, moon, sixteen, soviet, u, s, chinese, and, indian, spacecraft, have, used, braking, rockets, retrorockets, to, make, soft, landings, and, perform, scientific, operations, on, the, lunar, surface, in, 1966, the, soviet, union, accomplished, the, first, soft, landings, and, took, the, first, pictures, from, the, lunar, surface, during, the, luna, 9, and, luna, 13, missions, the, u, s, followed, with, five, surveyor, soft, landings, china, s, ongoing, chang, e, program, has, landed, 4, times, since, 2013, achieving, robotic, soil, sample, return, and, the, first, landing, on, the, far, side, of, the, moon, on, 23, august, 2023, isro, successfully, landed, its, chandrayaan, 3, module, in, the, lunar, south, pole, region, making, india, the, fourth, nation, to, successfully, complete, a, soft, landing, on, the, moon, chandrayaan, 3, saw, a, successful, soft, landing, of, its, vikram, lander, and, pragyan, rover, at, 6, 04, pm, ist, 1234, gmt, marking, the, first, uncrewed, soft, landing, in, the, little, explored, region, on, 19, january, 2024, jaxa, successfully, landed, its, slim, lander, making, japan, the, fifth, nation, to, successfully, complete, a, soft, landing, two, organizations, have, attempted, but, failed, to, achieve, soft, landings, israeli, private, space, agency, spaceil, with, their, beresheet, spacecraft, 2019, and, japanese, company, ispace, s, hakuto, r, mission, 1, 2023, on, 22, february, 2024, intuitive, machine, s, odysseus, successfully, landed, on, the, moon, after, taking, off, on, a, spacex, falcon, 9, liftoff, on, 15, february, 2024, in, a, mission, between, nasa, spacex, and, intuitive, machines, marking, the, united, states, first, soft, unmanned, moon, landing, in, over, 50, years, this, event, marked, the, first, successful, landing, of, a, privately, owned, spacecraft, on, the, moon, a, total, of, twelve, astronauts, have, landed, on, the, moon, this, was, accomplished, with, two, pilot, astronauts, flying, a, lunar, module, on, each, of, six, nasa, missions, the, missions, spanned, a, 41, month, period, starting, 20, july, 1969, beginning, with, neil, armstrong, and, buzz, aldrin, on, apollo, 11, and, ending, on, 14, december, 1972, with, gene, cernan, and, harrison, schmitt, on, apollo, 17, cernan, was, the, last, man, to, step, off, the, lunar, surface, all, apollo, lunar, missions, had, a, third, crew, member, who, remained, on, board, the, command, module, to, get, to, the, moon, a, spacecraft, must, first, leave, earth, s, gravity, well, currently, the, only, practical, means, is, a, rocket, unlike, airborne, vehicles, such, as, balloons, and, jets, a, rocket, can, continue, accelerating, in, the, vacuum, outside, the, atmosphere, upon, approach, of, the, target, moon, a, spacecraft, will, be, drawn, ever, closer, to, its, surface, at, increasing, speeds, due, to, gravity, in, order, to, land, intact, it, must, decelerate, to, less, than, about, 160, kilometres, per, hour, 100, mph, and, be, ruggedized, to, withstand, a, hard, landing, impact, or, it, must, decelerate, to, negligible, speed, at, contact, for, a, soft, landing, the, only, option, for, humans, the, first, three, attempts, by, the, u, s, to, perform, a, successful, hard, moon, landing, with, a, ruggedized, seismometer, package, in, 1962, all, failed, the, soviets, first, achieved, the, milestone, of, a, hard, lunar, landing, with, a, ruggedized, camera, in, 1966, followed, only, months, later, by, the, first, uncrewed, soft, lunar, landing, by, the, u, s, the, speed, of, a, crash, landing, on, its, surface, is, typically, between, 70, and, 100, of, the, escape, velocity, of, the, target, moon, and, thus, this, is, the, total, velocity, which, must, be, shed, from, the, target, moon, s, gravitational, attraction, for, a, soft, landing, to, occur, for, earth, s, moon, the, escape, velocity, is, 2, 38, kilometres, per, second, 1, 48, mi, s, the, change, in, velocity, referred, to, as, a, delta, v, is, usually, provided, by, a, landing, rocket, which, must, be, carried, into, space, by, the, original, launch, vehicle, as, part, of, the, overall, spacecraft, an, exception, is, the, soft, moon, landing, on, titan, carried, out, by, the, huygens, probe, in, 2005, as, the, moon, with, the, thickest, atmosphere, landings, on, titan, may, be, accomplished, by, using, atmospheric, entry, techniques, that, are, generally, lighter, in, weight, than, a, rocket, with, equivalent, capability, the, soviets, succeeded, in, making, the, first, crash, landing, on, the, moon, in, 1959, crash, landings, may, occur, because, of, malfunctions, in, a, spacecraft, or, they, can, be, deliberately, arranged, for, vehicles, which, do, not, have, an, onboard, landing, rocket, there, have, been, many, such, moon, crashes, often, with, their, flight, path, controlled, to, impact, at, precise, locations, on, the, lunar, surface, for, example, during, the, apollo, program, the, s, ivb, third, stage, of, the, saturn, v, rocket, as, well, as, the, spent, ascent, stage, of, the, lunar, module, were, deliberately, crashed, on, the, moon, several, times, to, provide, impacts, registering, as, a, moonquake, on, seismometers, that, had, been, left, on, the, lunar, surface, such, crashes, were, instrumental, in, mapping, the, internal, structure, of, the, moon, to, return, to, earth, the, escape, velocity, of, the, moon, must, be, overcome, for, the, spacecraft, to, escape, the, gravity, well, of, the, moon, rockets, must, be, used, to, leave, the, moon, and, return, to, space, upon, reaching, earth, atmospheric, entry, techniques, are, used, to, absorb, the, kinetic, energy, of, a, returning, spacecraft, and, reduce, its, speed, for, safe, landing, these, functions, greatly, complicate, a, moon, landing, mission, and, lead, to, many, additional, operational, considerations, any, moon, departure, rocket, must, first, be, carried, to, the, moon, s, surface, by, a, moon, landing, rocket, increasing, the, latter, s, required, size, the, moon, departure, rocket, larger, moon, landing, rocket, and, any, earth, atmosphere, entry, equipment, such, as, heat, shields, and, parachutes, must, in, turn, be, lifted, by, the, original, launch, vehicle, greatly, increasing, its, size, by, a, significant, and, almost, prohibitive, degree, the, political, context, of, the, 1960s, helps, to, parse, both, the, united, states, and, soviet, union, s, efforts, to, land, spacecraft, and, eventually, humans, on, the, moon, world, war, ii, had, introduced, many, new, and, deadly, innovations, including, blitzkrieg, style, surprise, attacks, used, in, the, invasion, of, poland, and, finland, as, well, as, in, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, the, v, 2, rocket, a, ballistic, missile, which, killed, thousands, in, attacks, on, london, and, antwerp, and, the, atom, bomb, which, killed, hundreds, of, thousands, in, the, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, in, the, 1950s, tensions, mounted, between, the, two, ideologically, opposed, superpowers, of, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, that, had, emerged, as, victors, in, the, conflict, particularly, after, the, development, by, both, countries, of, the, hydrogen, bomb, on, 4, october, 1957, the, soviet, union, launched, sputnik, 1, as, the, first, artificial, satellite, to, orbit, the, earth, and, so, initiated, the, space, race, this, unexpected, event, was, a, source, of, pride, to, the, soviets, and, shock, to, the, u, s, who, could, now, potentially, be, surprise, attacked, by, nuclear, tipped, soviet, rockets, in, under, 30, minutes, the, craft, was, also, barely, visible, to, the, naked, eye, as, the, steady, beeping, of, the, radio, beacon, aboard, sputnik, 1, as, it, passed, overhead, every, 96, minutes, which, was, widely, viewed, on, both, sides, as, effective, propaganda, to, third, world, countries, demonstrating, the, technological, superiority, of, the, soviet, political, system, compared, to, that, of, the, u, s, this, perception, was, reinforced, by, a, string, of, subsequent, rapid, fire, soviet, space, achievements, in, 1959, the, r, 7, rocket, was, used, to, launch, the, first, escape, from, earth, s, gravity, into, a, solar, orbit, the, first, crash, impact, onto, the, surface, of, the, moon, and, the, first, photography, of, the, never, before, seen, far, side, of, the, moon, these, were, the, luna, 1, luna, 2, and, luna, 3, spacecraft, the, u, s, response, to, these, soviet, achievements, was, to, greatly, accelerate, previously, existing, military, space, and, missile, projects, and, to, create, a, civilian, space, agency, nasa, military, efforts, were, initiated, to, develop, and, produce, mass, quantities, of, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, icbms, that, would, bridge, the, so, called, missile, gap, and, enable, a, policy, of, deterrence, to, nuclear, war, with, the, soviets, known, as, mutual, assured, destruction, or, mad, these, newly, developed, missiles, were, made, available, to, civilians, of, nasa, for, various, projects, which, would, have, the, added, benefit, of, demonstrating, the, payload, guidance, accuracy, and, reliabilities, of, u, s, icbms, to, the, soviets, after, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, historical, records, were, released, to, allow, the, true, accounting, of, soviet, lunar, efforts, unlike, the, u, s, tradition, of, assigning, a, particular, mission, name, in, advance, of, a, launch, the, soviets, assigned, a, public, luna, mission, number, only, if, a, launch, resulted, in, a, spacecraft, going, beyond, earth, orbit, the, policy, had, the, effect, of, hiding, soviet, moon, mission, failures, from, public, view, if, the, attempt, failed, in, earth, orbit, before, departing, for, the, moon, it, was, frequently, but, not, always, given, a, sputnik, or, cosmos, earth, orbit, mission, number, to, hide, its, purpose, launch, explosions, were, not, acknowledged, at, all, the, u, s, was, not, able, to, reach, the, moon, with, the, pioneer, and, ranger, programs, with, fifteen, consecutive, u, s, uncrewed, lunar, missions, from, 1958, to, 1964, failing, their, primary, photographic, missions, however, rangers, 4, and, 6, successfully, repeated, the, soviet, lunar, impacts, as, part, of, their, secondary, missions, three, u, s, missions, in, 1962, attempted, to, hard, land, small, seismometer, packages, released, by, the, main, ranger, spacecraft, these, surface, packages, were, to, use, retrorockets, to, survive, landing, unlike, the, parent, vehicle, which, was, designed, to, deliberately, crash, onto, the, surface, the, final, three, ranger, probes, performed, successful, high, altitude, lunar, reconnaissance, photography, missions, during, intentional, crash, impacts, between, 2, 62, and, 2, 68, kilometres, per, second, 9, 400, and, 9, 600, km, h, three, different, designs, of, pioneer, lunar, probes, were, flown, on, three, different, modified, icbms, those, flown, on, the, thor, booster, modified, with, an, able, upper, stage, carried, an, infrared, image, scanning, television, system, with, a, resolution, of, 1, milliradian, to, study, the, moon, s, surface, an, ionization, chamber, to, measure, radiation, in, space, a, diaphragm, microphone, assembly, to, detect, micrometeorites, a, magnetometer, and, temperature, variable, resistors, to, monitor, spacecraft, internal, thermal, conditions, the, first, a, mission, managed, by, the, united, states, air, force, exploded, during, launch, all, subsequent, pioneer, lunar, flights, had, nasa, as, the, lead, management, organization, the, next, two, returned, to, earth, and, burned, up, upon, reentry, into, the, atmosphere, after, achieved, maximum, altitudes, of, around, 114, 000, kilometres, 71, 000, mi, and, 1, 530, kilometres, 950, mi, respectively, far, short, of, the, roughly, 400, 000, kilometres, 250, 000, mi, required, to, reach, the, vicinity, of, the, moon, nasa, then, collaborated, with, the, united, states, army, s, ballistic, missile, agency, to, fly, two, extremely, small, cone, shaped, probes, on, the, juno, icbm, carrying, only, photocells, which, would, be, triggered, by, the, light, of, the, moon, and, a, lunar, radiation, environment, experiment, using, a, geiger, m, ller, tube, detector, the, first, of, these, reached, an, altitude, of, only, around, 100, 000, kilometres, 62, 000, mi, gathering, data, that, established, the, presence, of, the, van, allen, radiation, belts, before, reentering, earth, s, atmosphere, the, second, passed, by, the, moon, at, a, distance, of, more, than, 60, 000, kilometres, 37, 000, mi, twice, as, far, as, planned, and, too, far, away, to, trigger, either, of, the, on, board, scientific, instruments, yet, still, becoming, the, first, u, s, spacecraft, to, reach, a, solar, orbit, the, final, pioneer, lunar, probe, design, consisted, of, four, paddlewheel, solar, panels, extending, from, a, one, meter, diameter, spherical, spin, stabilized, spacecraft, body, equipped, to, take, images, of, the, lunar, surface, with, a, television, like, system, estimate, the, moon, s, mass, and, topography, of, the, poles, record, the, distribution, and, velocity, of, micrometeorites, study, radiation, measure, magnetic, fields, detect, low, frequency, electromagnetic, waves, in, space, and, use, a, sophisticated, integrated, propulsion, system, for, maneuvering, and, orbit, insertion, as, well, none, of, the, four, spacecraft, built, in, this, series, of, probes, survived, launch, on, its, atlas, icbm, outfitted, with, an, able, upper, stage, following, the, unsuccessful, atlas, able, pioneer, probes, nasa, s, jet, propulsion, laboratory, embarked, upon, an, uncrewed, spacecraft, development, program, whose, modular, design, could, be, used, to, support, both, lunar, and, interplanetary, exploration, missions, the, interplanetary, versions, were, known, as, mariners, lunar, versions, were, rangers, jpl, envisioned, three, versions, of, the, ranger, lunar, probes, block, i, prototypes, which, would, carry, various, radiation, detectors, in, test, flights, to, a, very, high, earth, orbit, that, came, nowhere, near, the, moon, block, ii, which, would, try, to, accomplish, the, first, moon, landing, by, hard, landing, a, seismometer, package, and, block, iii, which, would, crash, onto, the, lunar, surface, without, any, braking, rockets, while, taking, very, high, resolution, wide, area, photographs, of, the, moon, during, their, descent, the, ranger, 1, and, 2, block, i, missions, were, virtually, identical, spacecraft, experiments, included, a, lyman, alpha, telescope, a, rubidium, vapor, magnetometer, electrostatic, analyzers, medium, energy, range, particle, detectors, two, triple, coincidence, telescopes, a, cosmic, ray, integrating, ionization, chamber, cosmic, dust, detectors, and, scintillation, counters, the, goal, was, to, place, these, block, i, spacecraft, in, a, very, high, earth, orbit, with, an, apogee, of, 110, 000, kilometres, 68, 000, mi, and, a, perigee, of, 60, 000, kilometres, 37, 000, mi, from, that, vantage, point, scientists, could, make, direct, measurements, of, the, magnetosphere, over, a, period, of, many, months, while, engineers, perfected, new, methods, to, routinely, track, and, communicate, with, spacecraft, over, such, large, distances, such, practice, was, deemed, vital, to, be, assured, of, capturing, high, bandwidth, television, transmissions, from, the, moon, during, a, one, shot, fifteen, minute, time, window, in, subsequent, block, ii, and, block, iii, lunar, descents, both, block, i, missions, suffered, failures, of, the, new, agena, upper, stage, and, never, left, low, earth, parking, orbit, after, launch, both, burned, up, upon, reentry, after, only, a, few, days, the, first, attempts, to, perform, a, moon, landing, took, place, in, 1962, during, the, rangers, 3, 4, and, 5, missions, flown, by, the, united, states, all, three, block, ii, missions, basic, vehicles, were, 3, 1, m, high, and, consisted, of, a, lunar, capsule, covered, with, a, balsa, wood, impact, limiter, 650, mm, in, diameter, a, mono, propellant, mid, course, motor, a, retrorocket, with, a, thrust, of, 5, 050, pounds, force, 22, 5, kn, and, a, gold, and, chrome, plated, hexagonal, base, 1, 5, m, in, diameter, this, lander, code, named, tonto, was, designed, to, provide, impact, cushioning, using, an, exterior, blanket, of, crushable, balsa, wood, and, an, interior, filled, with, incompressible, liquid, freon, a, 42, kilogram, 93, lb, 30, centimetre, diameter, 0, 98, ft, metal, payload, sphere, floated, and, was, free, to, rotate, in, a, liquid, freon, reservoir, contained, in, the, landing, sphere, everything, that, we, do, ought, to, really, be, tied, in, to, getting, onto, the, moon, ahead, of, the, russians, we, re, ready, to, spend, reasonable, amounts, of, money, but, we, re, talking, about, fantastic, expenditures, which, wreck, our, budget, and, all, these, other, domestic, programs, and, the, only, justification, for, it, in, my, opinion, to, do, it, is, because, we, hope, to, beat, them, and, demonstrate, that, starting, behind, as, we, did, by, a, couple, of, years, by, god, we, passed, them, john, f, kennedy, on, the, planned, moon, landing, 21, november, 1962, this, payload, sphere, contained, six, silver, cadmium, batteries, to, power, a, fifty, milliwatt, radio, transmitter, a, temperature, sensitive, voltage, controlled, oscillator, to, measure, lunar, surface, temperatures, and, a, seismometer, designed, with, sensitivity, high, enough, to, detect, the, impact, of, a, 2, 3, kg, 5, lb, meteorite, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, moon, weight, was, distributed, in, the, payload, sphere, so, it, would, rotate, in, its, liquid, blanket, to, place, the, seismometer, into, an, upright, and, operational, position, no, matter, what, the, final, resting, orientation, of, the, external, landing, sphere, after, landing, plugs, were, to, be, opened, allowing, the, freon, to, evaporate, and, the, payload, sphere, to, settle, into, upright, contact, with, the, landing, sphere, the, batteries, were, sized, to, allow, up, to, three, months, of, operation, for, the, payload, sphere, various, mission, constraints, limited, the, landing, site, to, oceanus, procellarum, on, the, lunar, equator, which, the, lander, ideally, would, reach, 66, hours, after, launch, no, cameras, were, carried, by, the, ranger, landers, and, no, pictures, were, to, be, captured, from, the, lunar, surface, during, the, mission, instead, the, 3, 1, metres, 10, ft, ranger, block, ii, mother, ship, carried, a, 200, scan, line, television, camera, to, capture, images, during, the, free, fall, descent, to, the, lunar, surface, the, camera, was, designed, to, transmit, a, picture, every, 10, seconds, seconds, before, impact, at, 5, and, 0, 6, kilometres, 3, 11, and, 0, 37, mi, above, the, lunar, surface, the, ranger, mother, ships, took, pictures, which, may, be, viewed, here, other, instruments, gathering, data, before, the, mother, ship, crashed, onto, the, moon, were, a, gamma, ray, spectrometer, to, measure, overall, lunar, chemical, composition, and, a, radar, altimeter, the, radar, altimeter, was, to, give, a, signal, ejecting, the, landing, capsule, and, its, solid, fueled, braking, rocket, overboard, from, the, block, ii, mother, ship, the, braking, rocket, was, to, slow, and, the, landing, sphere, to, a, dead, stop, at, 330, metres, 1, 080, ft, above, the, surface, and, separate, allowing, the, landing, sphere, to, free, fall, once, more, and, hit, the, surface, on, ranger, 3, failure, of, the, atlas, guidance, system, and, a, software, error, aboard, the, agena, upper, stage, combined, to, put, the, spacecraft, on, a, course, that, would, miss, the, moon, attempts, to, salvage, lunar, photography, during, a, flyby, of, the, moon, were, thwarted, by, in, flight, failure, of, the, onboard, flight, computer, this, was, probably, because, of, prior, heat, sterilization, of, the, spacecraft, by, keeping, it, above, the, boiling, point, of, water, for, 24, hours, on, the, ground, to, protect, the, moon, from, being, contaminated, by, earth, organisms, ranger, 3, later, began, orbiting, the, sun, called, heliocentric, orbit, heat, sterilization, was, also, blamed, for, subsequent, in, flight, failures, of, the, spacecraft, computer, on, ranger, 4, and, the, power, subsystem, on, ranger, 5, only, ranger, 4, reached, the, moon, in, an, uncontrolled, crash, impact, on, the, far, side, of, the, moon, block, iii, probes, replaced, the, block, ii, landing, capsule, and, its, retrorocket, with, a, heavier, more, capable, television, system, to, support, landing, site, selection, for, upcoming, apollo, crewed, moon, landing, missions, six, cameras, were, designed, to, take, thousands, of, high, altitude, photographs, in, the, final, twenty, minute, period, before, crashing, on, the, lunar, surface, camera, resolution, was, 1, 132, scan, lines, far, higher, than, the, 525, lines, found, in, a, typical, u, s, 1964, home, television, while, ranger, 6, suffered, a, failure, of, this, camera, system, and, returned, no, photographs, despite, an, otherwise, successful, flight, the, subsequent, ranger, 7, mission, to, mare, cognitum, was, a, complete, success, breaking, the, six, year, string, of, failures, in, u, s, attempts, to, photograph, the, moon, at, close, range, the, ranger, 7, mission, was, viewed, as, a, national, turning, point, and, instrumental, in, allowing, the, key, 1965, nasa, budget, appropriation, to, pass, through, the, united, states, congress, intact, without, a, reduction, in, funds, for, the, apollo, crewed, moon, landing, program, subsequent, successes, with, ranger, 8, and, ranger, 9, further, buoyed, u, s, hopes, the, luna, 9, spacecraft, launched, by, the, soviet, union, performed, the, first, successful, soft, moon, landing, on, 3, february, 1966, airbags, protected, its, 99, kilogram, 218, lb, ejectable, capsule, which, survived, an, impact, speed, of, over, 15, metres, per, second, 54, km, h, 34, mph, luna, 13, duplicated, this, feat, with, a, similar, moon, landing, on, 24, december, 1966, both, returned, panoramic, photographs, that, were, the, first, views, from, the, lunar, surface, luna, 16, was, the, first, robotic, probe, to, land, on, the, moon, and, safely, return, a, sample, of, lunar, soil, back, to, earth, it, represented, the, first, lunar, sample, return, mission, by, the, soviet, union, and, was, the, third, lunar, sample, return, mission, overall, following, the, apollo, 11, and, apollo, 12, missions, this, mission, was, later, successfully, repeated, by, luna, 20, 1972, and, luna, 24, 1976, in, 1970, and, 1973, two, lunokhod, moonwalker, robotic, lunar, rovers, were, delivered, to, the, moon, where, they, successfully, operated, for, 10, and, 4, months, respectively, covering, 10, 5, km, 6, 5, mi, lunokhod, 1, and, 37, km, 23, mi, lunokhod, 2, these, rover, missions, were, in, operation, concurrently, with, the, zond, and, luna, series, of, moon, flyby, orbiter, and, landing, missions, the, u, s, robotic, surveyor, program, was, part, of, an, effort, to, locate, a, safe, site, on, the, moon, for, a, human, landing, and, test, under, lunar, conditions, the, radar, and, landing, systems, required, to, make, a, true, controlled, touchdown, five, of, surveyor, s, seven, missions, made, successful, uncrewed, moon, landings, surveyor, 3, was, visited, two, years, after, its, moon, landing, by, the, crew, of, apollo, 12, they, removed, parts, of, it, for, examination, back, on, earth, to, determine, the, effects, of, long, term, exposure, to, the, lunar, environment, within, four, months, of, each, other, in, early, 1966, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, had, accomplished, successful, moon, landings, with, uncrewed, spacecraft, to, the, general, public, both, countries, had, demonstrated, roughly, equal, technical, capabilities, by, returning, photographic, images, from, the, surface, of, the, moon, these, pictures, provided, a, key, affirmative, answer, to, the, crucial, question, of, whether, or, not, lunar, soil, would, support, upcoming, crewed, landers, with, their, much, greater, weight, however, the, luna, 9, hard, landing, of, a, ruggedized, sphere, using, airbags, at, a, 50, kilometre, per, hour, 31, mph, ballistic, impact, speed, had, much, more, in, common, with, the, failed, 1962, ranger, landing, attempts, and, their, planned, 160, kilometre, per, hour, 99, mph, impacts, than, with, the, surveyor, 1, soft, landing, on, three, footpads, using, its, radar, controlled, adjustable, thrust, retrorocket, while, luna, 9, and, surveyor, 1, were, both, major, national, accomplishments, only, surveyor, 1, had, reached, its, landing, site, employing, key, technologies, that, would, be, needed, for, a, crewed, flight, thus, as, of, mid, 1966, the, united, states, had, begun, to, pull, ahead, of, the, soviet, union, in, the, so, called, space, race, to, land, a, man, on, the, moon, advances, in, other, areas, were, necessary, before, crewed, spacecraft, could, follow, uncrewed, ones, to, the, surface, of, the, moon, of, particular, importance, was, developing, the, expertise, to, perform, flight, operations, in, lunar, orbit, ranger, surveyor, and, initial, luna, moon, landing, attempts, all, flew, directly, to, the, surface, without, a, lunar, orbit, such, direct, ascents, use, a, minimum, amount, of, fuel, for, uncrewed, spacecraft, on, a, one, way, trip, in, contrast, crewed, vehicles, need, additional, fuel, after, a, lunar, landing, to, enable, a, return, trip, back, to, earth, for, the, crew, leaving, this, massive, amount, of, required, earth, return, fuel, in, lunar, orbit, until, it, is, used, later, in, the, mission, is, far, more, efficient, than, taking, such, fuel, down, to, the, lunar, surface, in, a, moon, landing, and, then, hauling, it, all, back, into, space, yet, again, working, against, lunar, gravity, both, ways, such, considerations, lead, logically, to, a, lunar, orbit, rendezvous, mission, profile, for, a, crewed, moon, landing, accordingly, beginning, in, mid, 1966, both, the, u, s, and, u, s, s, r, naturally, progressed, into, missions, featuring, lunar, orbit, as, a, prerequisite, to, a, crewed, moon, landing, the, primary, goals, of, these, initial, uncrewed, orbiters, were, extensive, photographic, mapping, of, the, entire, lunar, surface, for, the, selection, of, crewed, landing, sites, and, for, the, soviets, the, checkout, of, radio, communications, gear, that, would, be, used, in, future, soft, landings, an, unexpected, major, discovery, from, initial, lunar, orbiters, were, vast, volumes, of, dense, materials, beneath, the, surface, of, the, moon, s, maria, such, mass, concentrations, mascons, can, send, a, crewed, mission, dangerously, off, course, in, the, final, minutes, of, a, moon, landing, when, aiming, for, a, relatively, small, landing, zone, that, is, smooth, and, safe, mascons, were, also, found, over, a, longer, period, of, time, to, greatly, disturb, the, orbits, of, low, altitude, satellites, around, the, moon, making, their, orbits, unstable, and, forcing, an, inevitable, crash, on, the, lunar, surface, in, the, relatively, short, period, of, months, to, a, few, years, controlling, the, location, of, impact, for, spent, lunar, orbiters, can, have, scientific, value, for, example, in, 1999, the, nasa, lunar, prospector, orbiter, was, deliberately, targeted, to, impact, a, permanently, shadowed, area, of, shoemaker, crater, near, the, lunar, south, pole, it, was, hoped, that, energy, from, the, impact, would, vaporize, suspected, shadowed, ice, deposits, in, the, crater, and, liberate, a, water, vapor, plume, detectable, from, earth, no, such, plume, was, observed, however, a, small, vial, of, ashes, from, the, body, of, pioneer, lunar, scientist, eugene, shoemaker, was, delivered, by, the, lunar, prospector, to, the, crater, named, in, his, honor, the, only, human, remains, on, the, moon, luna, 10, became, the, first, spacecraft, to, orbit, the, moon, on, 3, april, 1966, it, is, possible, to, aim, a, spacecraft, from, earth, so, it, will, loop, around, the, moon, and, return, to, earth, without, entering, lunar, orbit, following, the, so, called, free, return, trajectory, such, circumlunar, loop, missions, are, simpler, than, lunar, orbit, missions, because, rockets, for, lunar, orbit, braking, and, earth, return, are, not, required, however, a, crewed, circumlunar, loop, trip, poses, significant, challenges, beyond, those, found, in, a, crewed, low, earth, orbit, mission, offering, valuable, lessons, in, preparation, for, a, crewed, moon, landing, foremost, among, these, are, mastering, the, demands, of, re, entering, the, earth, s, atmosphere, upon, returning, from, the, moon, inhabited, earth, orbiting, vehicles, such, as, the, space, shuttle, return, to, earth, from, speeds, of, around, 7, 500, m, s, 27, 000, km, h, due, to, the, effects, of, gravity, a, vehicle, returning, from, the, moon, hits, earth, s, atmosphere, at, a, much, higher, speed, of, around, 11, 000, m, s, 40, 000, km, h, the, g, loading, on, astronauts, during, the, resulting, deceleration, can, be, at, the, limits, of, human, endurance, even, during, a, nominal, reentry, slight, variations, in, the, vehicle, flight, path, and, reentry, angle, during, a, return, from, the, moon, can, easily, result, in, fatal, levels, of, deceleration, force, achieving, a, crewed, circumlunar, loop, flight, prior, to, a, crewed, lunar, landing, became, a, primary, goal, of, the, soviets, with, their, zond, spacecraft, program, the, first, three, zonds, were, robotic, planetary, probes, after, that, the, zond, name, was, transferred, to, a, completely, separate, human, spaceflight, program, the, initial, focus, of, these, later, zonds, was, extensive, testing, of, required, high, speed, reentry, techniques, this, focus, was, not, shared, by, the, u, s, who, chose, instead, to, bypass, the, stepping, stone, of, a, crewed, circumlunar, loop, mission, and, never, developed, a, separate, spacecraft, for, this, purpose, initial, crewed, spaceflights, in, the, early, 1960s, placed, a, single, person, in, low, earth, orbit, during, the, soviet, vostok, and, u, s, mercury, programs, a, two, flight, extension, of, the, vostok, program, known, as, voskhod, effectively, used, vostok, capsules, with, their, ejection, seats, removed, to, achieve, soviet, space, firsts, of, multiple, person, crews, in, 1964, and, spacewalks, in, early, 1965, these, capabilities, were, later, demonstrated, by, the, u, s, in, ten, gemini, low, earth, orbit, missions, throughout, 1965, and, 1966, using, a, totally, new, second, generation, spacecraft, design, that, had, little, in, common, with, the, earlier, mercury, these, gemini, missions, went, on, to, prove, techniques, for, orbital, rendezvous, and, docking, crucial, to, a, crewed, lunar, landing, mission, profile, after, the, end, of, the, gemini, program, the, soviet, union, began, flying, their, second, generation, zond, crewed, spacecraft, in, 1967, with, the, ultimate, goal, of, looping, a, cosmonaut, around, the, moon, and, returning, him, or, her, immediately, to, earth, the, zond, spacecraft, was, launched, with, the, simpler, and, already, operational, proton, launch, rocket, unlike, the, parallel, soviet, human, moon, landing, effort, also, underway, at, the, time, based, on, third, generation, soyuz, spacecraft, requiring, development, of, the, advanced, n, 1, booster, the, soviets, thus, believed, they, could, achieve, a, crewed, zond, circumlunar, flight, years, before, a, u, s, human, lunar, landing, and, so, score, a, propaganda, victory, however, significant, development, problems, delayed, the, zond, program, and, the, success, of, the, u, s, apollo, lunar, landing, program, led, to, the, eventual, termination, of, the, zond, effort, like, zond, apollo, flights, were, generally, launched, on, a, free, return, trajectory, that, would, return, them, to, earth, via, a, circumlunar, loop, if, a, service, module, malfunction, failed, to, place, them, in, lunar, orbit, this, option, was, implemented, after, an, explosion, aboard, the, apollo, 13, mission, in, 1970, which, is, the, only, crewed, circumlunar, loop, mission, flown, to, date, zond, 5, was, the, first, spacecraft, to, carry, life, from, earth, to, the, vicinity, of, the, moon, and, return, initiating, the, final, lap, of, the, space, race, with, its, payload, of, tortoises, insects, plants, and, bacteria, despite, the, failure, suffered, in, its, final, moments, the, zond, 6, mission, was, reported, by, soviet, media, as, being, a, success, as, well, although, hailed, worldwide, as, remarkable, achievements, both, these, zond, missions, flew, off, nominal, reentry, trajectories, resulting, in, deceleration, forces, that, would, have, been, fatal, to, humans, as, a, result, the, soviets, secretly, planned, to, continue, uncrewed, zond, tests, until, their, reliability, to, support, human, flight, had, been, demonstrated, however, due, to, nasa, s, continuing, problems, with, the, lunar, module, and, because, of, cia, reports, of, a, potential, soviet, crewed, circumlunar, flight, in, late, 1968, nasa, fatefully, changed, the, flight, plan, of, apollo, 8, from, an, earth, orbit, lunar, module, test, to, a, lunar, orbit, mission, scheduled, for, late, december, 1968, in, early, december, 1968, the, launch, window, to, the, moon, opened, for, the, soviet, launch, site, in, baikonur, giving, the, ussr, their, final, chance, to, beat, the, us, to, the, moon, cosmonauts, went, on, alert, and, asked, to, fly, the, zond, spacecraft, then, in, final, countdown, at, baikonur, on, the, first, human, trip, to, the, moon, ultimately, however, the, soviet, politburo, decided, the, risk, of, crew, death, was, unacceptable, given, the, combined, poor, performance, to, that, point, of, zond, proton, and, so, scrubbed, the, launch, of, a, crewed, soviet, lunar, mission, their, decision, proved, to, be, a, wise, one, since, this, unnumbered, zond, mission, was, destroyed, in, another, uncrewed, test, when, it, was, finally, launched, several, weeks, later, by, this, time, flights, of, the, third, generation, u, s, apollo, spacecraft, had, begun, far, more, capable, than, the, zond, the, apollo, spacecraft, had, the, necessary, rocket, power, to, slip, into, and, out, of, lunar, orbit, and, to, make, course, adjustments, required, for, a, safe, reentry, during, the, return, to, earth, the, apollo, 8, mission, carried, out, the, first, human, trip, to, the, moon, on, 24, december, 1968, certifying, the, saturn, v, booster, for, crewed, use, and, flying, not, a, circumlunar, loop, but, instead, a, full, ten, orbits, around, the, moon, before, returning, safely, to, earth, apollo, 10, then, performed, a, full, dress, rehearsal, of, a, crewed, moon, landing, in, may, 1969, this, mission, orbited, within, 14, 4, kilometres, 47, 400, ft, of, the, lunar, surface, performing, necessary, low, altitude, mapping, of, trajectory, altering, mascons, using, a, factory, prototype, lunar, module, too, heavy, to, land, with, the, failure, of, the, robotic, soviet, sample, return, moon, landing, attempt, luna, 15, in, july, 1969, the, stage, was, set, for, apollo, 11, plans, for, human, moon, exploration, began, during, the, eisenhower, administration, in, a, series, of, mid, 1950s, articles, in, collier, s, magazine, wernher, von, braun, had, popularized, the, idea, of, a, crewed, expedition, to, establish, a, lunar, base, a, human, moon, landing, posed, several, daunting, technical, challenges, to, the, us, and, ussr, besides, guidance, and, weight, management, atmospheric, re, entry, without, ablative, overheating, was, a, major, hurdle, after, the, soviets, launched, sputnik, von, braun, promoted, a, plan, for, the, us, army, to, establish, a, military, lunar, outpost, by, 1965, after, the, early, soviet, successes, especially, yuri, gagarin, s, flight, us, president, john, f, kennedy, looked, for, a, project, that, would, capture, the, public, imagination, he, asked, vice, president, lyndon, johnson, to, make, recommendations, on, a, scientific, endeavor, that, would, prove, us, world, leadership, the, proposals, included, non, space, options, such, as, massive, irrigation, projects, to, benefit, the, third, world, the, soviets, at, the, time, had, more, powerful, rockets, than, the, us, which, gave, them, an, advantage, in, some, kinds, of, space, mission, advances, in, us, nuclear, weapon, technology, had, led, to, smaller, lighter, warheads, the, soviets, were, much, heavier, and, the, powerful, r, 7, rocket, was, developed, to, carry, them, more, modest, missions, such, as, flying, around, the, moon, or, a, space, lab, in, lunar, orbit, both, were, proposed, by, kennedy, to, von, braun, offered, too, much, advantage, to, the, soviets, landing, however, would, capture, the, world, s, imagination, johnson, had, championed, the, us, human, spaceflight, program, ever, since, sputnik, sponsoring, legislation, to, create, nasa, while, he, was, still, a, senator, when, kennedy, asked, him, in, 1961, to, research, the, best, achievement, to, counter, the, soviets, lead, johnson, responded, that, the, us, had, an, even, chance, of, beating, them, to, a, crewed, lunar, landing, but, not, for, anything, less, kennedy, seized, on, apollo, as, the, ideal, focus, for, efforts, in, space, he, ensured, continuing, funding, shielding, space, spending, from, the, 1963, tax, cut, but, diverting, money, from, other, nasa, scientific, projects, these, diversions, dismayed, nasa, s, leader, james, e, webb, who, perceived, the, need, for, nasa, s, support, from, the, scientific, community, the, moon, landing, required, development, of, the, large, saturn, v, launch, vehicle, which, achieved, a, perfect, record, zero, catastrophic, failures, or, launch, vehicle, caused, mission, failures, in, thirteen, launches, for, the, program, to, succeed, its, proponents, would, have, to, defeat, criticism, from, politicians, both, on, the, left, more, money, for, social, programs, and, on, the, right, more, money, for, the, military, by, emphasizing, the, scientific, payoff, and, playing, on, fears, of, soviet, space, dominance, kennedy, and, johnson, managed, to, swing, public, opinion, by, 1965, 58, percent, of, americans, favored, apollo, up, from, 33, percent, two, years, earlier, after, johnson, became, president, in, 1963, his, continuing, defense, of, the, program, allowed, it, to, succeed, in, 1969, as, kennedy, had, planned, soviet, leader, nikita, khrushchev, said, in, october, 1963, the, ussr, was, not, at, present, planning, flight, by, cosmonauts, to, the, moon, while, insisting, that, the, soviets, had, not, dropped, out, of, the, race, only, after, another, year, did, the, ussr, fully, commit, itself, to, a, moon, landing, attempt, which, ultimately, failed, at, the, same, time, kennedy, had, suggested, various, joint, programs, including, a, possible, moon, landing, by, soviet, and, u, s, astronauts, and, the, development, of, better, weather, monitoring, satellites, eventually, resulting, in, the, apollo, soyuz, mission, khrushchev, sensing, an, attempt, by, kennedy, to, steal, russian, space, technology, rejected, the, idea, at, first, if, the, ussr, went, to, the, moon, it, would, go, alone, though, khrushchev, was, eventually, warming, up, to, the, idea, the, realization, of, a, joint, moon, landing, was, choked, by, kennedy, s, assassination, sergey, korolev, the, soviet, space, program, s, chief, designer, had, started, promoting, his, soyuz, craft, and, the, n1, launcher, rocket, that, would, have, the, capability, of, carrying, out, a, human, moon, landing, khrushchev, directed, korolev, s, design, bureau, to, arrange, further, space, firsts, by, modifying, the, existing, vostok, technology, while, a, second, team, started, building, a, completely, new, launcher, and, craft, the, proton, booster, and, the, zond, for, a, human, cislunar, flight, in, 1966, in, 1964, the, new, soviet, leadership, gave, korolev, the, backing, for, a, moon, landing, effort, and, brought, all, crewed, projects, under, his, direction, with, korolev, s, death, and, the, failure, of, the, first, soyuz, flight, in, 1967, coordination, of, the, soviet, moon, landing, program, quickly, unraveled, the, soviets, built, a, landing, craft, and, selected, cosmonauts, for, a, mission, that, would, have, placed, alexei, leonov, on, the, moon, s, surface, but, with, the, successive, launch, failures, of, the, n1, booster, in, 1969, plans, for, a, crewed, landing, suffered, first, delay, and, then, cancellation, a, program, of, automated, return, vehicles, was, begun, in, the, hope, of, being, the, first, to, return, lunar, rocks, this, had, several, failures, it, eventually, succeeded, with, luna, 16, in, 1970, but, this, had, little, impact, because, the, apollo, 11, and, apollo, 12, lunar, landings, and, rock, returns, had, already, taken, place, by, then, in, total, twenty, four, u, s, astronauts, have, traveled, to, the, moon, three, have, made, the, trip, twice, and, twelve, have, walked, on, its, surface, apollo, 8, was, a, lunar, orbit, only, mission, apollo, 10, included, undocking, and, descent, orbit, insertion, doi, followed, by, lm, staging, to, csm, redocking, while, apollo, 13, originally, scheduled, as, a, landing, ended, up, as, a, lunar, fly, by, by, means, of, free, return, trajectory, thus, none, of, these, missions, made, landings, apollo, 7, and, apollo, 9, were, earth, orbit, only, missions, apart, from, the, inherent, dangers, of, crewed, moon, expeditions, as, seen, with, apollo, 13, one, reason, for, their, cessation, according, to, astronaut, alan, bean, is, the, cost, it, imposes, in, government, subsidies, president, richard, nixon, had, speechwriter, william, safire, prepare, a, condolence, speech, for, delivery, in, case, armstrong, and, aldrin, became, marooned, on, the, moon, s, surface, and, could, not, be, rescued, in, 1951, science, fiction, writer, arthur, c, clarke, forecast, that, a, man, would, reach, the, moon, by, 1978, on, 16, august, 2006, the, associated, press, reported, that, nasa, is, missing, the, original, slow, scan, television, tapes, which, were, made, before, the, scan, conversion, for, conventional, tv, of, the, apollo, 11, moon, walk, some, news, outlets, have, mistakenly, reported, the, sstv, tapes, found, in, western, australia, but, those, tapes, were, only, recordings, of, data, from, the, apollo, 11, early, apollo, surface, experiments, package, the, tapes, were, found, in, 2008, and, sold, at, auction, in, 2019, for, the, 50th, anniversary, of, the, landing, scientists, believe, the, six, american, flags, planted, by, astronauts, have, been, bleached, white, because, of, more, than, 40, years, of, exposure, to, solar, radiation, using, lroc, images, it, has, been, determined, that, five, of, the, six, american, flags, are, still, standing, and, casting, shadows, at, all, of, the, sites, except, apollo, 11, astronaut, buzz, aldrin, reported, that, the, flag, was, blown, over, by, the, exhaust, from, the, ascent, engine, during,
