of, the, 200, republicans, in, the, new, parliament, 80, were, former, orl, anists, philippe, s, supporters, and, moderately, conservative, they, were, led, by, adolphe, thiers, who, was, elected, in, 26, departments, the, most, of, any, candidate, there, were, an, equal, number, of, more, radical, republicans, including, jules, favre, and, jules, ferry, who, wanted, a, republic, without, a, monarch, and, who, felt, that, signing, the, peace, treaty, was, unavoidable, finally, on, the, extreme, left, there, were, the, radical, republicans, and, socialists, a, group, that, included, louis, blanc, l, on, gambetta, and, georges, clemenceau, this, group, was, dominant, in, paris, where, they, won, 37, of, the, 42, seats, on, 17, february, the, new, parliament, elected, the, 74, year, old, thiers, as, chief, executive, of, the, third, republic, he, was, considered, to, be, the, candidate, most, likely, to, bring, peace, and, to, restore, order, long, an, opponent, of, the, prussian, war, thiers, persuaded, parliament, that, peace, was, necessary, he, travelled, to, versailles, where, bismarck, and, the, german, emperor, were, waiting, and, on, 24, february, the, armistice, was, signed, at, the, end, of, the, war, 400, obsolete, muzzle, loading, bronze, cannons, paid, for, by, the, paris, public, via, a, subscription, remained, in, the, city, the, new, central, committee, of, the, national, guard, now, dominated, by, radicals, decided, to, put, the, cannons, in, parks, in, the, working, class, neighborhoods, of, belleville, buttes, chaumont, and, montmartre, to, keep, them, away, from, the, regular, army, and, to, defend, the, city, against, any, attack, by, the, national, government, thiers, was, equally, determined, to, bring, the, cannons, under, national, government, control, clemenceau, a, friend, of, several, revolutionaries, tried, to, negotiate, a, compromise, some, cannons, would, remain, in, paris, and, the, rest, go, to, the, army, however, neither, thiers, nor, the, national, assembly, accepted, his, proposals, the, chief, executive, wanted, to, restore, order, and, national, authority, in, paris, as, quickly, as, possible, and, the, cannons, became, a, symbol, of, that, authority, the, assembly, also, refused, to, prolong, the, moratorium, on, debt, collections, imposed, during, the, war, and, suspended, two, radical, newspapers, le, cri, du, peuple, of, jules, valles, and, le, mot, d, ordre, of, henri, rochefort, which, further, inflamed, parisian, radical, opinion, thiers, also, decided, to, move, the, national, assembly, and, government, from, bordeaux, to, versailles, rather, than, to, paris, to, be, farther, away, from, the, pressure, of, demonstrations, which, further, enraged, the, national, guard, and, the, radical, political, clubs, on, 17, march, 1871, there, was, a, meeting, of, thiers, and, his, cabinet, who, were, joined, by, paris, mayor, jules, ferry, national, guard, commander, general, louis, d, aurelle, de, paladines, and, general, joseph, vinoy, commander, of, the, regular, army, units, in, paris, thiers, announced, a, plan, to, send, the, army, the, next, day, to, take, charge, of, the, cannons, the, plan, was, initially, opposed, by, war, minister, adolphe, le, fl, d, aurelle, de, paladines, and, vinoy, who, argued, that, the, move, was, premature, because, the, army, had, too, few, soldiers, was, undisciplined, and, demoralized, and, that, many, units, had, become, politicized, and, were, unreliable, vinoy, urged, that, they, wait, until, germany, had, released, the, french, prisoners, of, war, and, the, army, returned, to, full, strength, thiers, insisted, that, the, planned, operation, must, go, ahead, as, quickly, as, possible, to, have, the, element, of, surprise, if, the, seizure, of, the, cannon, was, not, successful, the, government, would, withdraw, from, the, centre, of, paris, build, up, its, forces, and, then, attack, with, overwhelming, force, as, they, had, done, during, the, uprising, of, june, 1848, the, council, accepted, his, decision, and, vinoy, gave, orders, for, the, operation, to, begin, the, next, day, early, in, the, morning, of, 18, march, two, brigades, of, soldiers, climbed, the, butte, of, montmartre, where, the, largest, collection, of, cannons, 170, in, number, were, located, a, small, group, of, revolutionary, national, guardsmen, were, already, there, and, there, was, a, brief, confrontation, between, the, brigade, led, by, general, claude, lecomte, and, the, national, guard, one, guardsman, named, turpin, was, shot, later, dying, word, of, the, shooting, spread, quickly, and, members, of, the, national, guard, from, all, over, the, neighbourhood, along, with, others, including, clemenceau, hurried, to, the, site, to, confront, the, soldiers, while, the, army, had, succeeded, in, securing, the, cannons, at, belleville, and, buttes, chaumont, and, other, strategic, points, at, montmartre, a, crowd, gathered, and, continued, to, grow, and, the, situation, grew, increasingly, tense, the, horses, that, were, needed, to, take, the, cannon, away, did, not, arrive, and, the, army, units, were, immobilized, as, the, soldiers, were, surrounded, they, began, to, break, ranks, and, join, the, crowd, general, lecomte, tried, to, withdraw, and, then, ordered, his, soldiers, to, load, their,

despite, internal, differences, the, council, began, to, organise, public, services, for, the, city, which, at, the, time, consisted, of, two, million, residents, it, also, reached, a, consensus, on, certain, policies, that, tended, towards, a, progressive, secular, and, social, democracy, because, the, commune, met, on, fewer, than, sixty, days, before, it, was, suppressed, only, a, few, decrees, were, actually, implemented, the, decrees, included, women, played, an, important, role, in, both, the, initiation, and, the, governance, of, the, commune, though, women, could, not, vote, in, the,

that, evening, the, first, reaction, of, many, of, the, national, guard, was, to, find, someone, to, blame, and, dombrowski, was, the, first, to, be, accused, rumours, circulated, that, he, had, accepted, a, million, francs, to, give, up, the, city, he, was, deeply, offended, by, the, rumours, they, stopped, when, dombrowski, died, two, days, later, from, wounds, received, on, the,

of, justice, and, solidarity, which, should, be, and, will, be, the, laws, of, the, world, march, at, the, enemy, and, may, your, revolutionary, energy, show, him, that, someone, can, sell, paris,

bristling, with, barricades, and, that, behind, these, improvised, ramparts, it, will, hurl, again, its, cry, of, war, its, cry, of, pride, its, cry, of, defiance, but, its, cry, of, victory, because, paris, with, its, barricades, is, undefeatable, that, revolutionary, paris, that, paris, of, great, days, does, its, duty, the, commune, and, the, committee, of, public, safety, will, do, theirs, despite, the, appeals, only, fifteen, to, twenty, thousand, persons, including, many, women, and, children, responded, the, forces, of, the, commune, were, outnumbered, five, to, one, by, the, army, of, marshal, macmahon, once, the, fighting, began, inside, paris, the, strong, neighborhood, loyalties, that, had, been, an, advantage, of, the, commune, became, something, of, a, disadvantage, instead, of, an, overall, planned, defence, each, quartier, fought, desperately, for, its, survival, and, each, was, overcome, in, turn, the, webs, of, narrow, streets, that, made, entire, districts, nearly, impregnable, in, earlier, parisian, revolutions, had, in, the, centre, been, replaced, by, wide, boulevards, during, haussmann, s, renovation, of, paris, the, versailles, forces, enjoyed, a, centralised, command, and, had, superior, numbers, equally, important, they, had, learned, the, tactics, of, street, fighting, from, 1848, and, earlier, uprisings, they, avoided, making, frontal, attacks, on, commune, barricades, they, tunnelled, through, walls, of, neighbouring, houses, to, establish, positions, above, the, barricades, and, gradually, worked, their, way, around, and, behind, them, usually, forcing, the, communards, to, withdraw, without, a, fight, the, majority, of, the, barricades, in, paris, were, abandoned, without, combat, on, the, morning, of, 22, may, the, regular, army, occupied, a, large, area, from, the, porte, dauphine, to, the, champ, de, mars, and, the, cole, militaire, where, general, cissey, established, his, headquarters, to, the, porte, de, vanves, in, a, short, time, the, 5th, corps, of, the, army, advanced, toward, parc, monceau, and, place, clichy, while, general, f, lix, douay, occupied, the, place, de, l, toile, and, general, clichant, occupied, the, gare, saint, lazaire, little, resistance, was, encountered, in, the, west, of, paris, but, the, army, moved, forward, slowly, and, cautiously, in, no, hurry, no, one, had, expected, the, army, to, enter, the, city, so, only, a, few, large, barricades, were, already, in, place, on, the, rue, saint, florentin, and, avenue, de, l, op, ra, and, the, rue, de, rivoli, barricades, had, not, been, prepared, in, advance, some, nine, hundred, barricades, were, built, hurriedly, out, of, paving, stones, and, sacks, of, earth, many, other, people, prepared, shelters, in, the, cellars,

guard, batteries, on, the, terrace, of, the, tuileries, palace, on, the, same, day, the, first, executions, of, national, guard, soldiers, by, the, regular, army, inside, paris, took, place, some, sixteen, prisoners, captured, on, the, rue, du, bac, were, given, a, summary, hearing, and, then, shot, on, 23, may, the, next, objective, of, the, army, was, the, butte, montmartre, where, the, uprising, had, begun, the, national, guard, had, built, and, manned, a, circle, of, barricades, and, makeshift, forts, around, the, base, of, the, butte, the, eighty, five, cannon, and, twenty, rapid, firing, guns, captured, from, the, army, at, the, beginning, of, the, commune, were, still, there, but, no, one, had, expected, an, attack, and, they, had, no, ammunition, powder, cartridges, or, trained, gunners, the, garrison, of, one, barricade, at, chaussee, clignancourt, was, defended, in, part, by, a, battalion, of, about, thirty, women, including, louise, michel, the, celebrated, red, virgin, of, montmartre, who, had, already, participated, in, many, battles, outside, the, city, she, was, seized, by, regular, soldiers, and, thrown, into, the, trench, in, front, of, the, barricade, and, left, for, dead, she, escaped, and, soon, afterwards, surrendered, to, the, army, to, prevent, the, arrest, of, her, mother, the, battalions, of, the, national, guard, were, no, match, for, the, army, by, midday, on, the, 23rd, the, regular, soldiers, were, at, the, top, of, montmartre, and, the, tricolor, flag, was, raised, over, the, solferino, tower, the, soldiers, captured, 42, guardsmen, and, several, women, took, them, to, the, same, house, on, rue, des, rosier, where, generals, clement, thomas, and, lecomte, had, been, executed, and, shot, them, on, the, rue, royale, soldiers, seized, the, formidable, barricade, around, the, madeleine, church, 300, prisoners, captured, with, their, weapons, were, shot, there, the, largest, of, the, mass, executions, of, the, rebels, on, the, same, day, having, had, little, success, fighting, the, army, units, of, national, guardsmen, began, to, take, revenge, by, burning, public, buildings, symbolising, the, government, the, guardsmen, led, by, paul, brunel, one, of, the, original, leaders, of, the, commune, took, cans, of, oil, and, set, fire, to, buildings, near, the, rue, royale, and, the, rue, du, faubourg, saint, honor, following, the, example, set, by, brunel, guardsmen, set, fire, to, dozens, of, other, buildings, on, rue, saint, florentin, rue, de, rivoli, rue, du, bac, rue, de, lille, and, other, streets, the, tuileries, palace, which, had, been, the, residence, of, most, of, the, monarchs, of, france, from, henry, iv, to, napoleon, iii, was, defended, by, a, garrison, of, some, three, hundred, national, guard, with, thirty, cannon, placed, in, the, garden, they, had, been, engaged, in, a, day, long, artillery, duel, with, the, regular, army, at, about, seven, in, the, evening, the,

to, all, the, monuments, of, paris, the, richelieu, library, of, the, louvre, connected, to, the, tuileries, was, also, set, on, fire, and, entirely, destroyed, the, rest, of, the, louvre, was, saved, by, the, efforts, of, the, museum, curators, and, fire, brigades, the, consensus, of, later, historians, is, that, most, of, the, major, fires, were, started, by, the, national, guard, and, several, organised, communard, groups, but, that, few, if, any, fires, were, started, by, women, in, addition, to, public, buildings, the, national, guard, also, started, fires, at, the, homes, of, a, number, of, residents, associated, with, the, regime, of, napoleon, iii, such, as, that, of, historian, and, playwright, prosper, m, rim, e, author, of, carmen, at, two, in, the, morning, on, 24, may, brunel,

historians, have, long, debated, the, number, of, communards, killed, during, bloody, week, the, official, army, report, by, general, f, lix, antoine, appert, mentioned, only, army, casualties, which, amounted, from, april, through, may, to, 877, killed, 6, 454, wounded, and, 183, missing, the, report, assessed, information, on, communard, casualties, only, as, very, incomplete, the, issue, of, casualties, during, the, bloody, week, arose, at, a, national, assembly, hearing, on, 28, august, 1871, when, marshal, macmahon, testified, deputy, m, vacherot, told, him, a, general, has, told, me, that, the, number, killed, in, combat, on, the, barricades, or, after, the, combat, was, as, many, as, 17, 000, men, macmahon, responded, i, don, t, know, what, that, estimate, is, based, upon, it, seems, exaggerated, to, me, all, i, can, say, is, that, the, insurgents, lost, a, lot, more, people, than, we, did, vacherot, continued, perhaps, this, number, applies, to, all, of, the, siege, and, to, the, fighting, at, forts, d, issy, and, vanves, macmahon, replied, the, number, is, exaggerated, vacherot, persisted, it, was, general, appert, who, gave, me, that, information, perhaps, he, meant, both, dead, and, wounded, macmahon, replied, that, s, a, different, matter, in, 1876, prosper, olivier, lissagaray, who, had, fought, on, the, barricades, during, bloody, week, and, had, gone, into, exile, in, london, wrote, a, highly, popular, and, sympathetic, history, of, the, commune, at, the, end, he, wrote, no, one, knows, the, exact, number, of, victims, of, the, bloody, week, the, chief, of, the, military, justice, department, claimed, seventeen, thousand, shot, this, was, inaccurate, appert, made, no, such, claim, he, referred, only, to, prisoners, the, municipal, council, of, paris, lissagaray, continued, paid, for, the, burial, of, seventeen, thousand, bodies, but, a, large, number, of, persons, were, killed, or, cremated, outside, of, paris, later, historians, including, robert, tombs, could, not, find, the, source, lissagaray, cited, for, the, city, payment, for, seventeen, thousand, burials, and, lissagaray, provided, no, evidence, that, thousands, of, communards, were, cremated, or, buried, outside, paris, it, is, no, exaggeration, lissagaray, concluded, to, say, twenty, thousand, a, number, admitted, by, the, officers, but, neither, macmahon, or, appert, had, admitted, that, twenty, thousand, were, killed, they, both, said, the, number, was, exaggerated, in, a, new, 1896, edition, lissagaray, wrote, that, the, twenty, thousand, estimate, included, those, killed, not, only, in, paris, but, also, in, the, other, communes, that, broke, out, in, france, at, the, same, time, and, those, killed, in, fighting, outside, paris, before, the, bloody, week, several, historians, repeated, versions, of, lissagaray, s, estimate, among, them, pierre, milza, as, many, as, twenty, thousand, alfred, cobban, and, benedict, anderson, vladimir, lenin, said, that, lissagaray, s, estimate, demonstrated, ruling, class, brutality, 20, 000, killed, in, the, streets, lessons, bourgeoisie, will, stop, at, nothing, between, 1878, and, 1880, a, french, historian, and, member, of, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, maxime, du, camp, wrote, a, new, history, les, convulsions, de, paris, du, camp, had, witnessed, the, last, days, of, the, commune, went, inside, the, tuileries, palace, shortly, after, the, fires, were, put, out, witnessed, the, executions, of, communards, by, soldiers, and, the, bodies, in, the, streets, he, studied, the, question, of, the, number, of, dead, and, studied, the, records, of, the, office, of, inspection, of, the, paris, cemeteries, which, was, in, charge, of, burying, the, dead, based, on, their, records, he, reported, that, between, 20, and, 30, may, 5, 339, communard, corpses, had, been, taken, from, the, streets, or, paris, morgue, to, the, city, cemeteries, for, burial, between, 24, may, and, 6, september, the, office, of, inspection, of, cemeteries, reported, that, an, additional, 1, 328, corpses, were, exhumed, from, temporary, graves, at, 48, sites, including, 754, corpses, inside, the, old, quarries, near, parc, des, buttes, chaumont, for, a, total, of, 6, 667, marxist, critics, attacked, du, camp, and, his, book, collette, wilson, called, it, a, key, text, in, the, construction, and, promulgation, of, the, reactionary, memory, of, the, commune, and, paul, lidsky, called, it, the, bible, of, the, anti, communard, literature, in, 2012, however, supporting, du, camp, s, research, historian, robert, tombs, made, a, new, study, of, the, paris, cemetery, records, and, placed, the, total, number, killed, between, 6, 000, and, 7, 000, estimating, around, 1, 400, of, those, to, have, been, executed, and, the, rest, being, killed, in, combat, or, dying, from, wounds, received, during, the, fighting, jacques, rougerie, who, had, earlier, accepted, the, 20, 000, figure, wrote, in, 2014, the, number, ten, thousand, victims, seems, today, the, most, plausible, it, remains, an, enormous, number, for, the, time, the, debate, was, still, underway, in, 2021, a, new, book, was, published, by, mathematician, michele, audin, in, may, 2021, to, commemorate, the, 150th, anniversary, of, the, commune, citing, cemetery, and, police, records, which, she, said, had, not, been, consulted, by, tombs, and, other, earlier, historians, she, wrote, that, more, than, ten, thousand, and, certainly, fifteen, thousand, communards, had, been, killed, in, the, bloody, week, the, number, killed, during, the, bloody, week, usually, estimated, at, ten, to, fifteen, thousand, or, possibly, more, was, extraordinarily, high, by, historical, standards, eight, years, before, the, bloody, week, during, the, three, days, of, the, battle, of, gettysburg, in, july, 1863, the, deadliest, battle, of, the, american, civil, war, a, total, of, 7, 863, soldiers, both, confederate, and, union, were, killed, or, about, half, as, many, as, the, estimated, commune, casualties, the, number, may, have, equalled, or, exceeded, the, number, executed, during, the, reign, of, terror, during, the, french, revolution, when, following, june, 1793, 16, 594, official, death, sentences, were, carried, out, throughout, france, french, writers, and, artists, had, strong, views, about, the,

suspected, enemies, on, the, other, side, the, young, anatole, france, described, the, commune, as, a, committee, of, assassins, a, band, of, hooligans, a, government, of, crime, and, madness, the, diarist, edmond, de, goncourt, wrote, three, days, after, la, semaine, sanglante, the, bleeding, has, been, done, thoroughly, and, a, bleeding, like, that, by, killing, the, rebellious, part, of, a, population, postpones, the, next, revolution, the, old, society, has, twenty, years, of, peace, before, it, on, 23, april, george, sand, an, ardent, republican, who, had, taken, part, in, the, 1848,

commune, was, finished, flaubert, wrote, to, sand, i, come, from, paris, and, i, do, not, know, whom, to, speak, to, i, am, suffocated, i, am, quite, upset, or, rather, out, of, heart, the, sight, of, the, ruins, is, nothing, compared, to, the, great, parisian, insanity, with, very, rare, exceptions, everybody, seemed, to, me, only, fit, for, the, strait, jacket, one, half, of, the, population, longs, to, hang, the, other, half, which, returns, the, compliment, that, is, clearly, to, be, read, in, the, eyes, of, the, passers, by, victor, hugo, blamed, thiers, for, his, short, sightedness, at, the, news, that, the, government, had, failed, to, have, the, cannons, seized, he, wrote, in, his, diary, he, touched, off, the, fuse, to, the, powder, keg, thiers, is, premeditated, thoughtlessness, on, the, other, hand, he, was, critical, of, the, commune, but, sympathetic, to, the, communards, at, the, beginning, of, april, he, moved, to, brussels, to, take, care, of, the, family, of, his, son, who, had, just, died, on, 9, april, he, wrote, in, short, this, commune, is, as, idiotic, as, the, national, assembly, is, ferocious, from, both, sides, folly, he, wrote, poems, that, criticized, both, the, government, and, the, commune, s, policy, of, taking, hostages, for, reprisals, and, condemned, the, destruction, of, the, vend, me, column, on, 25, may, during, the, bloody, week, he, wrote, a, monstrous, act, they, ve, set, fire, to, paris, they, ve, been, searching, for, firemen, as, far, away, as, brussels, but, after, the, repression, he, offered, to, give, sanctuary, to, members, of, the, commune, which, he, said, was, barely, elected, and, of, which, i, never, approved, he, became, the, most, vocal, advocate, of, an, amnesty, for, exiled, communards,

pushed, over, the, limit, the, exasperation, of, the, army, those, who, burn, and, who, massacre, merit, no, other, justice, than, the, gunshot, of, a, soldier, but, on, 1, june, when, the, fighting, was, over, his, tone, had, changed, the, court, martials, are, still, meeting, and, the, summary, executions, continue, less, numerous, it, s, true, the, sound, of, firing, squads, which, one, still, hears, in, the, mournful, city, atrociously, prolongs, the, nightmare, paris, is, sick, of, executions, it, seems, to, paris, that, they, re, shooting, everyone, paris, is, not, complaining, about, the, shooting, of, the, members, of, the, commune, but, of, innocent, people, it, believes, that, among, the, pile, there, are, innocent, people, and, that, it, s, time, that, each, execution, is, preceded, by, at, least, an, attempt, at, a, serious, inquiry, when, the, echoes, of, the, last, shots, have, ceased, it, will, take, a, great, deal, of, gentleness, to, heal, the, million, people, suffering, nightmares, those, who, have, emerged, shivering, from, the, fire, and, massacre, the, anarchist, philosopher, george, woodcock, said, that, a, notable, contribution, to, the, activities, of, the, commune, and, particularly, to, the, organization, of, public, services, was, made, by, members, of, various, anarchist, factions, including, the, mutualists, courbet, longuet, and, vermorel,

weapons, and, wearing, a, military, uniform, defiantly, she, vowed, to, never, renounce, the, commune, and, dared, the, judges, to, sentence, her, to, death, according, to, court, records, michel, told, the, court, since, it, seems, that, every, heart, that, beats, for, freedom, has, no, right, to, anything, but, a, little, slug, of, lead, i, demand, my, share, if, you, let, me, live, i, shall,

of, a, new, society, its, martyrs, are, enshrined, in, the, great, heart, of, the, working, class, its, exterminators, history, has, already, nailed, to, that, eternal, pillory, from, which, all, of, the, prayers, of, their, priest, will, not, avail, to, redeem, them, later, however, in, private, marx, expressed, a, different, more, critical, view, of, the, commune, in, 1881, in, a, letter, to, a, dutch, friend, nieuwenhaus, he, wrote, the, commune, was, simply, the, rebellion, of, a, city, in, exceptional, circumstances, and, furthermore, the, majority, of, the, commune, was, in, no, way, socialist, and, could, not, have, been, with, a, little, bit, of, good, sense, they, might, however, have, obtained, a, compromise, with, versailles, favourable, to, the, mass, of, the, people, which, was, in, fact, the, only, real, possibility, engels, echoed, his, partner, maintaining, that, the, absence, of, a, standing, army, the, self, policing, of, the, quarters, and, other, features, meant, that, the, commune, was, no, longer, a, state, in, the, old, repressive, sense, of, the, term, it, was, a, transitional, form, moving, towards, the, abolition, of, the, state, as, such, he, used, the, famous, term, later, taken, up, by, lenin, and, the, bolsheviks, the, commune, was, he, said, the, first, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, a, state, run, by, workers, and, in, the, interests, of, workers, but, marx, and, engels, also, analyzed, what, they, perceived, to, be, the, weaknesses, or, errors, of, the, commune, including, its, inability, to, link, up, with, the, rest, of, the, french, people, its, failure, to, completely, re, organize, state, machinery, its, central, committee, passing, over, power, too, soon, to, the, representative, assembly, its, failure, to, immediately, pursue, the, retreating, bourgeois, and, the, failure, to, recognize, the, possibility, that, france, and, prussia, would, unite, against, the, commune, the, other, point, of, disagreement, was, the, anti, authoritarian, socialists, opposition, to, the, communist, conception, of, conquest, of, power, and, of, a, temporary, transitional, state, the, anarchists, were, in, favour, of, general, strike, and, immediate, dismantlement, of, the, state, through, the, constitution, of, decentralised, workers, councils, as, those, seen, in, the, commune, lenin, like, marx, considered, the, commune, a, living, example, of, the, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, but, he, criticised, the, communards, for, not, having, done, enough, to, secure, their, position, highlighting, two, errors, in, particular, the, first, was, that, the, communards, stopped, half, way, led, astray, by, dreams, of, establishing, a, higher, justice, in, the, country, such, institutions, as, the, banks, for, example, were, not, taken, over, secondly, he, thought, their, excessive, magnanimity, had, prevented, them, from, destroying, the, class, enemy, for, lenin, the, communards, underestimated, the, significance, of, direct, military, operations, in, civil, war, and, instead, of, launching, a, resolute, offensive, against, versailles, that, would, have, crowned, its, victory, in, paris, it, tarried, and, gave, the, versailles, government, time, to, gather, the, dark, forces, and, prepare, for, the, blood, soaked, week, of, may, in, 1926, mao, zedong, published, the, importance, of, commemorating, the, paris, commune, similarly, to, lenin, s, analysis, mao, wrote, that, there, were, two, reasons, for, the, commune, s, failure, 1, it, lacked, a, united, and, disciplined, party, to, lead, it, and, 2, it, was, too, benevolent, towards, its, enemies, the, american, ambassador, in, paris, during, the, commune, elihu, washburne, writing, in, his, personal, diary, which, is, quoted, at, length, in, noted, historian, david, mccullough, s, book, the, greater, journey, simon, schuster, 2011, described, the, communards, as, brigands, assassins, and, scoundrels, i, have, no, time, now, to, express, my, detestation, hey, threaten, to, destroy, paris, and, bury, everybody, in, its, ruins, before, they, will, surrender, edwin, child, a, young, londoner, working, in, paris, noted, that, during, the, commune, the, women, behaved, like, tigresses, throwing, petroleum, everywhere, and, distinguishing, themselves, by, the, fury, with, which, they, fought, however, it, has, been, argued, in, recent, research, that, these, famous, female, arsonists, of, the, commune, or, p, troleuses, may, have, been, exaggerated, or, a, myth, lissagaray, claimed, that, because, of, this, myth, hundreds, of, working, class, women, were, murdered, in, paris, in, late, may, falsely, accused, of, being, p, troleuses, but, he, offered, no, evidence, to, support, his, claim, lissagaray, also, claimed, that, the, artillery, fire, by, the, french, army, was, responsible, for, probably, half, of, the, fires, that, consumed, the, city, during, the, bloody, week, however, photographs, of, the, ruins, of, the, tuileries, palace, the, hotel, de, ville, and, other, prominent, government, buildings, that, burned, show, that, the, exteriors, were, untouched, by, cannon, fire, while, the, interiors, were, completely, gutted, by, fire, and, prominent, communards, such, as, jules, bergeret, who, escaped, to, live, in, new, york, proudly, claimed, credit, for, the, most, famous, acts, of, arson, historian, j, p, t, bury, considers, that, thiers, tackled, the, crisis, in, a, ruthless, but, successful, way, thus, giving, a, solid, base, to, the, third, republic, as, he, put, it, the, exile, of, so, many, extremists, enabled, the, new, republic, to, develop, in, a, peaceful, and, orderly, fashion, this, view, is, shared, by, french, historian, alain, plessis, who, writes, that, the, crushing, of, the, communards, was, ultimately, to, facilitate, the, advent, of, the, third, republic, for, david, thomson, thiers, had, no, other, option, to, restore, the, unity, of, a, country, fractured, by, an, overwhelming, defeat, and, innumerable, factions, another, french, historian, paul, lidsky, argues, that, thiers, felt, urged, by, mainstream, newspapers, and, leading, intellectuals, to, take, decisive, action, against, the, social, and, democratic, vermin, le, figaro, those, abominable, ruffians, countess, of, s, gur, even, a, moderate, daily, newspaper, like, le, drapeau, tricolore, wrote, even, though, we, were, to, drown, this, uprising, in, blood, were, we, to, bury, it, under, the, ruins, of, the, burning, city, there, would, be, no, room, for, compromise, theodore, zeldin, in, france, 1848, 1945, vol, i, goes, so, far, as, to, say, thiers, deliberately, ordered, paris, to, be, evacuated, in, order, to, incite, part, of, the, population, to, rise, up, and, eventually, have, a, pretext, for, crushing, paris, as, a, rebellious, force, the, paris, commune, inspired, other, uprisings, named, or, called, communes, in, moscow, december, 1905, hungary, march, july, 1919, canton, december, 1927, most, famously, petrograd, 1917, and, shanghai, 1927, and, shanghai, 1967, the, commune, was, regarded, with, admiration, and, awe, by, later, communist, and, leftist, leaders, vladimir, lenin, identified, the, russian, soviets, as, the, contemporary, forms, of, the, commune, and, wrote, we, are, only, dwarves, perched, on, the, shoulders, of, those, giants, he, celebrated, by, dancing, in, the, snow, in, moscow, on, the, day, that, his, bolshevik, government, was, more, than, two, months, old, surpassing, the,

would, form, a, commune, an, association, of, workers, and, that, we, would, put, an, end, to, bureaucracy, that, is, a, goal, that, we, are, still, far, from, reaching, the, bolsheviks, renamed,

would, have, with, the, written, word, the, historian, zoe, baker, writes, that, while, a, person, must, find, buy, and, read, a, book, or, newspaper, for, it, to, radicalise, them, an, insurrection,
