the, papal, states, p, e, p, l, pay, p, l, italian, stato, pontificio, latin, dicio, pontificia, officially, the, state, of, the, church, italian, stato, della, chiesa, latin, status, ecclesiasticus, were, a, conglomeration, of, territories, on, the, italian, peninsula, under, the, direct, sovereign, rule, of, the, pope, from, 756, to, 1870, they, were, among, the, major, states, of, italy, from, the, 8th, century, until, the, unification, of, italy, which, took, place, between, 1859, and, 1870, and, culminated, in, their, demise, the, state, was, legally, established, in, the, 8th, century, when, pepin, the, short, king, of, the, franks, gifted, pope, stephen, ii, as, a, temporal, sovereign, lands, formerly, held, by, arian, lombards, adding, them, to, lands, and, other, real, estate, formerly, acquired, and, held, by, the, bishops, of, rome, as, landlords, from, the, time, of, constantine, onward, this, donation, came, about, as, part, of, a, process, whereby, the, popes, began, to, turn, away, from, the, byzantine, emperors, as, their, foremost, temporal, guardians, for, reasons, such, as, increased, imperial, taxes, disagreement, with, respect, to, iconoclasm, and, failure, of, the, emperors, or, their, exarchs, in, italy, to, protect, rome, and, the, rest, of, the, peninsula, from, barbarian, invasion, and, pillage, during, the, renaissance, the, papal, territory, expanded, greatly, and, the, pope, became, one, of, italy, s, most, important, rulers, as, well, as, the, head, of, western, christianity, at, their, zenith, the, papal, states, covered, most, of, the, modern, italian, regions, of, lazio, which, includes, rome, marche, umbria, romagna, and, portions, of, emilia, these, lands, represented, the, temporal, power, of, the, pope, as, opposed, to, his, ecclesiastical, primacy, by, 1860, much, of, the, papal, states, territory, had, been, conquered, by, the, kingdom, of, italy, only, lazio, including, rome, remained, under, the, pope, s, temporal, control, in, 1870, the, pope, lost, lazio, and, rome, and, had, no, physical, territory, at, all, except, the, leonine, city, within, rome, which, the, new, italian, state, refrained, from, occupying, militarily, despite, its, annexation, in, 1929, the, italian, fascist, leader, benito, mussolini, the, head, of, the, italian, government, ended, the, prisoner, in, the, vatican, problem, involving, a, unified, italy, and, the, holy, see, by, negotiating, the, lateran, treaty, signed, by, the, two, parties, this, treaty, recognized, the, sovereignty, of, the, holy, see, over, a, newly, created, territorial, entity, a, city, state, within, rome, limited, to, a, token, territory, which, became, the, vatican, city, the, papal, states, were, also, known, as, the, papal, state, although, the, plural, is, usually, preferred, the, singular, is, equally, correct, as, the, polity, was, more, than, a, mere, personal, union, the, territories, were, also, referred, to, variously, as, the, state, s, of, the, church, the, pontifical, states, the, ecclesiastical, states, the, patrimony, of, st, peter, or, the, roman, states, italian, stato, pontificio, also, stato, della, chiesa, stati, della, chiesa, stati, pontifici, and, stato, ecclesiastico, latin, status, pontificius, also, dicio, pontificia, papal, rule, to, some, extent, the, name, used, varied, with, the, preferences, and, habits, of, the, european, languages, in, which, it, was, expressed, for, its, first, 300, years, within, the, roman, empire, the, church, was, persecuted, and, unable, to, hold, or, transfer, property, early, congregations, met, in, rooms, set, aside, for, the, purpose, in, the, homes, of, wealthy, adherents, and, a, number, of, titular, churches, located, on, the, outskirts, of, rome, were, held, as, property, by, individuals, rather, than, by, any, corporate, body, nonetheless, the, property, held, nominally, or, actually, by, individual, members, of, the, roman, churches, would, usually, be, treated, as, a, common, patrimony, handed, over, successively, to, the, legitimate, heir, of, that, property, often, its, senior, deacons, who, were, in, turn, assistants, to, the, local, bishop, this, common, patrimony, became, quite, considerable, including, as, it, did, not, only, houses, etc, in, rome, or, nearby, but, also, landed, estates, such, as, latifundia, whole, or, in, part, across, italy, and, beyond, a, law, of, constantine, the, great, promulgated, in, 321, allowed, the, christian, church, to, posses, property, and, restored, to, it, any, property, formerly, confiscated, in, the, larger, cities, of, this, empire, the, property, restored, would, have, been, quite, considerable, the, roman, patrimony, not, least, among, them, the, lateran, palace, was, gifted, to, the, patrimony, most, probably, from, constantine, himself, other, donations, followed, primarily, in, mainland, italy, but, also, in, the, provinces, of, the, roman, empire, however, the, roman, church, held, all, of, these, lands, as, a, private, landowner, not, as, a, sovereign, entity, following, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, the, papacy, found, itself, increasingly, placed, in, a, precarious, and, vulnerable, position, as, central, roman, authority, disintegrated, throughout, the, late, 5th, century, control, over, the, italian, peninsula, repeatedly, changed, hands, falling, under, the, arian, suzerainty, of, odoacer, in, 473, and, in, 493, theodoric, king, of, the, ostrogoths, the, ostrogothic, kings, would, continue, to, rule, much, of, italy, until, 554, the, roman, church, submitted, of, necessity, to, their, sovereign, authority, while, asserting, its, spiritual, primacy, over, the, whole, of, christendom, beginning, in, 535, the, byzantine, emperor, justinian, i, launched, a, series, of, campaigns, to, wrest, italy, from, the, ostrogoths, which, continued, until, 554, and, devastated, italy, s, political, and, economic, structures, justinian, established, the, exarchate, of, ravenna, of, which, the, duchy, of, rome, an, area, roughly, coterminous, with, modern, day, lazio, was, an, administrative, division, in, 568, the, lombards, entered, the, peninsula, from, the, north, establishing, their, own, italian, kingdom, and, over, the, next, two, centuries, would, conquer, most, of, the, italian, territory, recently, regained, by, byzantium, by, the, 7th, century, byzantine, authority, was, largely, limited, to, a, diagonal, band, running, roughly, from, ravenna, where, the, emperor, s, vicar, or, exarch, was, located, to, rome, and, south, to, naples, plus, coastal, exclaves, north, of, naples, the, band, of, byzantine, control, contracted, and, the, borders, of, the, rome, ravenna, corridor, became, extremely, narrow, with, effective, byzantine, power, weighted, at, the, northeast, end, of, this, territory, the, pope, as, the, largest, landowner, and, most, prestigious, figure, in, italy, began, by, default, to, take, on, much, of, the, ruling, authority, that, the, byzantines, were, unable, to, exercise, in, the, areas, surrounding, the, city, of, rome, while, the, popes, legally, remained, roman, subjects, under, byzantine, authority, in, practice, the, duchy, of, rome, became, an, independent, state, popular, support, for, the, popes, in, italy, enabled, several, to, defy, the, will, of, the, byzantine, emperor, pope, gregory, ii, excommunicated, emperor, leo, iii, during, the, iconoclastic, controversy, nevertheless, the, pope, and, the, exarch, still, worked, together, to, limit, the, rising, power, of, the, lombards, in, italy, as, byzantine, power, weakened, though, the, papacy, assumed, an, ever, larger, role, in, protecting, rome, from, the, lombards, but, lacking, direct, control, over, sizable, military, assets, the, pope, relied, mainly, on, diplomacy, to, achieve, as, much, in, practice, these, papal, efforts, served, to, focus, lombard, aggrandizement, on, the, exarch, and, ravenna, a, climactic, moment, in, the, founding, of, the, papal, states, was, the, agreement, over, boundaries, contained, in, the, lombardic, king, liutprand, s, donation, of, sutri, 728, to, pope, gregory, ii, when, the, exarchate, of, ravenna, finally, fell, to, the, lombards, in, 751, the, duchy, of, rome, was, completely, cut, off, from, the, byzantine, empire, of, which, it, was, theoretically, still, a, part, the, popes, renewed, earlier, attempts, to, secure, the, support, of, the, franks, in, 751, pope, zachary, had, pepin, the, short, crowned, king, in, place, of, the, powerless, merovingian, figurehead, king, childeric, iii, zachary, s, successor, pope, stephen, ii, later, granted, pepin, the, title, patrician, of, the, romans, pepin, led, a, frankish, army, into, italy, in, 754, and, 756, defeated, the, lombards, thus, taking, control, of, northern, italy, and, made, a, gift, of, the, lands, formerly, constituting, the, exarchate, of, ravenna, to, the, pope, in, 781, charlemagne, codified, the, regions, over, which, the, pope, would, be, temporal, sovereign, the, duchy, of, rome, ravenna, the, duchy, of, the, pentapolis, parts, of, the, duchy, of, benevento, tuscany, corsica, lombardy, and, a, number, of, italian, cities, the, cooperation, between, the, papacy, and, the, carolingian, dynasty, climaxed, in, 800, when, pope, leo, iii, crowned, charlemagne, emperor, of, the, romans, from, the, 9th, century, to, the, 12th, century, the, precise, nature, of, the, relationship, between, the, popes, and, emperors, and, between, the, papal, states, and, the, empire, was, disputed, it, was, unclear, whether, the, papal, states, were, a, separate, realm, with, the, pope, as, their, sovereign, ruler, or, a, part, of, the, frankish, empire, over, which, the, popes, had, administrative, control, as, suggested, in, the, late, 9th, century, treatise, libellus, de, imperatoria, potestate, in, urbe, roma, or, whether, the, holy, roman, emperors, were, vicars, of, the, pope, ruling, christendom, with, the, pope, directly, responsible, only, for, the, environs, of, rome, and, spiritual, duties, the, holy, roman, empire, in, its, frankish, form, collapsed, when, it, was, subdivided, among, charlemagne, s, grandchildren, imperial, power, in, italy, waned, and, the, papacy, s, prestige, declined, this, led, to, a, rise, in, the, power, of, the, local, roman, nobility, and, the, control, of, the, papal, states, during, the, early, 10th, century, passed, to, a, powerful, and, corrupt, aristocratic, family, the, theophylacti, this, period, was, later, dubbed, the, saeculum, obscurum, dark, age, and, sometimes, as, the, rule, by, harlots, in, practice, the, popes, were, unable, to, exercise, effective, sovereignty, over, the, extensive, and, mountainous, territories, of, the, papal, states, and, the, region, preserved, its, old, system, of, government, with, many, small, countships, and, marquisates, each, centred, upon, a, fortified, rocca, over, several, campaigns, in, the, mid, 10th, century, the, german, ruler, otto, i, conquered, northern, italy, pope, john, xii, crowned, him, emperor, the, first, so, crowned, in, more, than, forty, years, and, the, two, of, them, ratified, the, diploma, ottonianum, by, which, the, emperor, became, the, guarantor, of, the, independence, of, the, papal, states, yet, over, the, next, two, centuries, popes, and, emperors, squabbled, over, a, variety, of, issues, and, the, german, rulers, routinely, treated, the, papal, states, as, part, of, their, realms, on, those, occasions, when, they, projected, power, into, northern, and, central, italy, as, the, gregorian, reform, worked, to, free, the, administration, of, the, church, from, imperial, interference, the, independence, of, the, papal, states, increased, in, importance, after, the, extinction, of, the, hohenstaufen, dynasty, the, german, emperors, rarely, interfered, in, italian, affairs, in, response, to, the, struggle, between, the, guelphs, and, ghibellines, the, treaty, of, venice, made, official, the, independence, of, the, papal, states, from, the, holy, roman, empire, in, 1177, by, 1300, the, papal, states, along, with, the, rest, of, the, italian, principalities, were, effectively, independent, from, 1305, to, 1378, the, popes, lived, in, the, papal, enclave, of, avignon, surrounded, by, provence, and, under, the, influence, of, the, french, kings, this, period, was, known, as, the, avignonese, or, babylonian, captivity, during, this, period, the, city, of, avignon, itself, and, the, surrounding, comtat, venaissin, was, added, to, the, papal, states, it, remained, a, papal, possession, for, some, 400, years, even, after, the, popes, returned, to, rome, until, it, was, seized, and, incorporated, into, the, french, state, during, the, french, revolution, during, the, avignon, papacy, local, despots, took, advantage, of, the, absence, of, the, popes, to, establish, themselves, in, nominally, papal, cities, the, pepoli, in, bologna, the, ordelaffi, in, forl, the, manfredi, in, faenza, and, the, malatesta, in, rimini, all, gave, nominal, acknowledgment, to, their, papal, overlords, and, were, declared, vicars, of, the, church, in, ferrara, the, death, of, azzo, viii, d, este, without, legitimate, heirs, 1308, encouraged, pope, clement, v, to, bring, ferrara, under, his, direct, rule, however, it, was, governed, by, his, appointed, vicar, king, robert, of, naples, for, only, nine, years, before, the, citizens, recalled, the, este, from, exile, 1317, interdiction, and, excommunications, were, in, vain, because, in, 1332, john, xxii, was, obliged, to, name, three, este, brothers, as, his, vicars, in, ferrara, in, rome, itself, the, orsini, and, the, colonna, struggled, for, supremacy, dividing, the, city, s, rioni, between, them, the, resulting, aristocratic, anarchy, in, the, city, provided, the, setting, for, the, fantastic, dreams, of, universal, democracy, of, cola, di, rienzo, who, was, acclaimed, tribune, of, the, people, in, 1347, and, met, a, violent, death, in, early, october, 1354, as, he, was, assassinated, by, supporters, of, the, colonna, family, to, many, rather, than, an, ancient, roman, tribune, reborn, he, had, become, just, another, tyrant, using, the, rhetoric, of, roman, renewal, and, rebirth, to, mask, his, grab, for, power, as, guido, ruggiero, states, even, with, the, support, of, petrarch, his, return, to, first, times, and, the, rebirth, of, ancient, rome, was, one, that, would, not, prevail, the, rienzo, episode, engendered, renewed, attempts, from, the, absentee, papacy, to, re, establish, order, in, the, dissolving, papal, states, resulting, in, the, military, progress, of, cardinal, albornoz, who, was, appointed, papal, legate, and, his, condottieri, heading, a, small, mercenary, army, having, received, the, support, of, the, archbishop, of, milan, giovanni, visconti, he, defeated, giovanni, di, vico, lord, of, viterbo, moving, against, galeotto, malatesta, of, rimini, and, the, ordelaffi, of, forl, the, montefeltro, of, urbino, and, the, da, polenta, of, ravenna, and, against, the, cities, of, senigallia, and, ancona, the, last, holdouts, against, full, papal, control, were, giovanni, manfredi, of, faenza, and, francesco, ii, ordelaffi, of, forl, albornoz, at, the, point, of, being, recalled, in, a, meeting, with, all, the, papal, vicars, on, 29, april, 1357, promulgated, the, constitutiones, sanct, matris, ecclesi, which, replaced, the, mosaic, of, local, law, and, accumulated, traditional, liberties, with, a, uniform, code, of, civil, law, these, constitutiones, aegidianae, as, they, are, informally, known, mark, a, watershed, in, the, legal, history, of, the, papal, states, they, remained, in, effect, until, 1816, pope, urban, v, ventured, a, return, to, italy, in, 1367, that, proved, premature, he, returned, to, avignon, in, 1370, just, before, his, death, during, the, renaissance, the, papal, territory, expanded, greatly, notably, under, popes, alexander, vi, and, julius, ii, the, pope, became, one, of, italy, s, most, important, secular, rulers, as, well, as, the, head, of, the, church, signing, treaties, with, other, sovereigns, and, fighting, wars, in, practice, though, most, of, the, papal, states, were, still, only, nominally, controlled, by, the, pope, and, much, of, the, territory, was, ruled, by, minor, princes, control, was, always, contested, indeed, it, took, until, the, 16th, century, for, the, pope, to, have, any, genuine, control, over, all, his, territories, papal, responsibilities, were, often, in, conflict, the, papal, states, were, involved, in, at, least, three, wars, in, the, first, two, decades, of, the, 16th, century, julius, ii, the, warrior, pope, fought, on, their, behalf, the, reformation, began, in, 1517, in, 1527, before, the, holy, roman, empire, fought, the, protestants, troops, loyal, to, emperor, charles, v, brutally, sacked, rome, and, imprisoned, pope, clement, vii, as, a, side, effect, of, battles, over, the, papal, states, thus, clement, vii, was, forced, to, give, up, parma, modena, and, several, smaller, territories, a, generation, later, the, armies, of, king, philip, ii, of, spain, defeated, those, of, pope, paul, iv, in, the, italian, war, of, 1551, 1559, fought, to, prevent, growing, spanish, dominance, in, italy, this, period, saw, a, gradual, revival, of, the, pope, s, temporal, power, in, the, papal, states, throughout, the, 16th, century, virtually, independent, fiefs, such, as, rimini, a, possession, of, the, malatesta, family, were, brought, back, under, papal, control, in, 1512, the, state, of, the, church, annexed, parma, and, piacenza, which, in, 1545, became, an, independent, duchy, under, an, illegitimate, son, of, pope, paul, iii, this, process, culminated, in, the, reclaiming, of, the, duchy, of, ferrara, in, 1598, and, the, duchy, of, urbino, in, 1631, at, its, greatest, extent, in, the, 18th, century, the, papal, states, included, most, of, central, italy, latium, umbria, marche, and, the, legations, of, ravenna, ferrara, and, bologna, extending, north, into, the, romagna, it, also, included, the, small, enclaves, of, benevento, and, pontecorvo, in, southern, italy, and, the, larger, comtat, venaissin, around, avignon, in, southern, france, the, french, revolution, affected, the, temporal, territories, of, the, papacy, as, well, as, the, roman, church, in, general, in, 1791, an, election, in, comtat, venaissin, and, avignon, was, followed, by, occupation, by, revolutionary, france, later, with, the, french, invasion, of, italy, in, 1796, the, legations, the, papal, states, northern, territories, were, seized, and, became, part, of, the, cisalpine, republic, two, years, later, french, forces, invaded, the, remaining, area, of, the, papal, states, and, in, february, 1798, general, louis, alexandre, berthier, declared, a, roman, republic, pope, pius, vi, fled, from, rome, to, siena, and, died, in, exile, in, valence, in, 1799, in, october, 1799, neapolitan, troops, under, king, ferdinant, invaded, the, newfound, republic, and, restored, papal, states, ending, the, republic, french, quickly, drove, the, neapolitans, out, and, reoccupied, the, papal, states, but, didn, t, bother, restoring, the, republic, as, they, continued, their, invasion, to, naples, where, they, established, another, republic, in, june, 1800, french, consulate, formally, concluded, the, occupation, and, restored, the, papal, states, with, the, newly, elected, pope, pius, vii, taking, residence, in, rome, yet, in, 1808, the, french, empire, under, napoleon, invaded, again, and, this, time, on, 17, may, 1809, the, remainder, of, the, states, of, the, church, were, annexed, to, france, forming, the, d, partements, of, tibre, and, trasim, ne, following, the, fall, of, the, first, french, empire, in, 1814, the, congress, of, vienna, formally, restored, the, italian, territories, of, the, papal, states, but, not, the, comtat, venaissin, or, avignon, to, vatican, control, upon, restitution, of, sovereignty, to, the, papal, states, pius, vii, decided, to, abolish, feudalism, transforming, all, the, noble, titles, temporarily, abolished, during, the, napoleonic, occupation, into, honorifics, disconnected, from, territorial, privileges, in, 1853, pius, ix, put, an, end, to, the, centuries, old, duality, between, the, papal, nobility, and, the, roman, baronial, families, by, equating, the, civic, patriciate, of, the, city, of, rome, with, the, nobility, created, by, the, pope, from, 1814, until, the, death, of, pope, gregory, xvi, in, 1846, the, popes, followed, a, reactionary, policy, in, the, papal, states, for, instance, the, city, of, rome, maintained, the, last, jewish, ghetto, in, western, europe, italian, nationalism, had, been, stoked, during, the, napoleonic, period, but, dashed, by, the, settlement, of, the, congress, of, vienna, 1814, 15, which, sought, to, restore, the, pre, napoleonic, conditions, most, of, northern, italy, was, under, the, rule, of, junior, branches, of, the, habsburgs, and, the, bourbons, the, papal, states, in, central, italy, and, the, bourbon, kingdom, of, the, two, sicilies, in, the, south, were, both, restored, popular, opposition, to, the, reconstituted, and, corrupt, clerical, government, led, to, revolts, in, 1830, and, in, 1848, which, were, suppressed, by, the, intervention, of, the, austrian, army, the, nationalist, and, liberal, revolutions, of, 1848, affected, much, of, europe, in, february, 1849, a, roman, republic, was, declared, and, the, hitherto, liberally, inclined, pope, pius, ix, had, to, flee, the, city, the, revolution, was, suppressed, with, french, help, in, 1849, and, pius, ix, switched, to, a, conservative, line, of, government, until, his, return, to, rome, in, 1850, the, papal, states, were, governed, by, a, group, of, cardinals, known, as, the, red, triumvirate, as, a, result, of, the, second, italian, war, of, independence, piedmont, sardinia, annexed, lombardy, while, giuseppe, garibaldi, overthrew, the, bourbon, monarchy, in, the, south, afraid, that, garibaldi, would, set, up, a, republican, government, the, piedmontese, government, petitioned, french, emperor, napoleon, iii, for, permission, to, send, troops, through, the, papal, states, to, gain, control, of, the, south, this, was, granted, on, the, condition, that, rome, be, left, undisturbed, in, 1860, with, much, of, the, region, already, in, rebellion, against, papal, rule, piedmont, sardinia, invaded, and, conquered, the, eastern, two, thirds, of, the, papal, states, cementing, its, hold, on, the, south, bologna, ferrara, umbria, the, marches, benevento, and, pontecorvo, were, all, formally, annexed, by, november, of, the, same, year, while, considerably, reduced, the, papal, states, nevertheless, still, covered, the, latium, and, large, areas, northwest, of, rome, a, unified, kingdom, of, italy, was, declared, and, in, march, 1861, the, first, italian, parliament, which, met, in, turin, the, old, capital, of, piedmont, declared, rome, the, capital, of, the, new, kingdom, however, the, italian, government, could, not, take, possession, of, the, city, because, a, french, garrison, in, rome, protected, pope, pius, ix, the, opportunity, for, the, kingdom, of, italy, to, eliminate, the, papal, states, came, in, 1870, the, outbreak, of, the, franco, prussian, war, in, july, prompted, napoleon, iii, to, recall, his, garrison, from, rome, and, the, collapse, of, the, second, french, empire, at, the, battle, of, sedan, deprived, rome, of, its, french, protector, king, victor, emmanuel, ii, at, first, aimed, at, a, peaceful, conquest, of, the, city, and, proposed, sending, troops, into, rome, under, the, guise, of, offering, protection, to, the, pope, when, the, pope, refused, italy, declared, war, on, 10, september, 1870, and, the, italian, army, commanded, by, general, raffaele, cadorna, crossed, the, frontier, of, the, papal, territory, on, september, 11, and, advanced, slowly, toward, rome, the, italian, army, reached, the, aurelian, walls, on, september, 19, and, placed, rome, under, a, state, of, siege, although, the, pope, s, tiny, army, was, incapable, of, defending, the, city, pius, ix, ordered, it, to, put, up, more, than, token, resistance, to, emphasize, that, italy, was, acquiring, rome, by, force, and, not, consent, this, incidentally, served, the, purposes, of, the, italian, state, and, gave, rise, to, the, myth, of, the, breach, of, porta, pia, in, reality, a, tame, affair, involving, a, cannonade, at, close, range,
