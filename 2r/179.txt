the, delian, league, was, a, confederacy, of, greek, city, states, numbering, between, 150, and, 330, founded, in, 478, bc, under, the, leadership, hegemony, of, athens, whose, purpose, was, to, continue, fighting, the, persian, empire, after, the, greek, victory, in, the, battle, of, plataea, at, the, end, of, the, second, persian, invasion, of, greece, the, league, functioned, as, a, dual, offensive, and, defensive, alliance, symmachia, of, autonomous, states, similar, to, its, rival, association, the, peloponnesian, league, the, league, s, modern, name, derives, from, its, official, meeting, place, the, island, of, delos, where, congresses, were, held, within, the, sanctuary, of, the, temple, of, apollo, contemporary, authors, referred, to, the, organization, simply, as, the, athenians, and, their, allies, while, sparta, excelled, as, greece, s, greatest, power, on, land, athens, turned, to, the, seas, becoming, the, dominant, naval, power, of, the, greek, world, following, sparta, s, withdrawal, from, the, conflict, with, persia, athens, took, the, lead, of, the, hellenic, alliance, accompanied, by, several, states, around, the, aegean, and, the, anatolian, coast, the, delian, league, was, formed, as, an, anti, persian, defensive, association, of, equal, city, states, seeking, protection, under, athens, as, the, latter, wished, to, extend, its, support, towards, the, ionian, greek, colonies, of, anatolia, by, the, mid, fifth, century, bc, the, alliance, had, developed, into, a, naval, imperial, power, called, the, athenian, empire, where, athens, established, complete, dominion, and, the, allies, became, increasingly, less, autonomous, the, alliance, held, an, assembly, of, representatives, in, order, to, shape, its, policy, while, the, members, swore, an, oath, of, loyalty, to, the, coalition, the, delian, league, successfully, accomplished, its, principal, strategic, goal, by, decisively, expelling, the, remaining, persian, forces, from, the, aegean, as, a, result, persia, would, cease, to, pose, a, major, threat, to, greece, for, the, following, fifty, years, from, its, inception, athens, became, the, league, s, biggest, source, of, military, power, while, more, and, more, allies, preferred, to, pay, the, dues, in, cash, athens, began, to, use, the, league, s, funds, for, its, own, purposes, like, the, reinforcement, of, its, naval, supremacy, which, led, to, conflicts, between, the, city, and, its, less, powerful, allies, at, times, culminating, in, rebelions, like, that, of, thasos, in, 465, bc, the, league, s, treasury, initially, stood, in, delos, until, in, a, symbolic, gesture, pericles, moved, it, to, athens, in, 454, bc, by, 431, bc, the, threat, that, the, league, presented, to, spartan, hegemony, combined, with, athens, s, heavy, handed, control, of, the, delian, league, prompted, the, outbreak, of, the, peloponnesian, war, the, league, was, dissolved, upon, the, war, s, conclusion, in, 404, bc, under, the, direction, of, lysander, the, spartan, commander, witnessing, sparta, s, growing, hegemony, in, the, first, half, of, the, 4th, century, bc, athens, went, on, to, partly, revive, the, alliance, this, time, called, the, second, athenian, league, reestablishing, its, naval, dominance, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, the, greco, persian, wars, had, their, roots, in, the, conquest, of, the, greek, cities, of, asia, minor, and, particularly, ionia, by, the, achaemenid, persian, empire, of, cyrus, the, great, shortly, after, 550, bc, the, persians, found, the, ionians, difficult, to, rule, eventually, settling, for, sponsoring, a, tyrant, in, each, ionian, city, while, greek, states, had, in, the, past, often, been, ruled, by, tyrants, this, form, of, government, was, on, the, decline, by, 500, bc, ionia, appears, to, have, been, ripe, for, rebellion, against, these, persian, clients, the, simmering, tension, finally, broke, into, open, revolt, due, to, the, actions, of, the, tyrant, of, miletus, aristagoras, attempting, to, save, himself, after, a, disastrous, persian, sponsored, expedition, in, 499, bc, aristagoras, chose, to, declare, miletus, a, democracy, this, triggered, similar, revolutions, across, ionia, extending, to, doris, and, aeolis, beginning, the, ionian, revolt, the, greek, states, of, athens, and, eretria, allowed, themselves, to, be, drawn, into, this, conflict, by, aristagoras, and, during, their, only, campaigning, season, 498, bc, they, contributed, to, the, capture, and, burning, of, the, persian, regional, capital, of, sardis, after, this, the, ionian, revolt, carried, on, without, further, outside, aid, for, a, further, five, years, until, it, was, finally, completely, crushed, by, the, persians, however, in, a, decision, of, great, historic, significance, the, persian, king, darius, the, great, decided, that, despite, having, subdued, the, revolt, there, remained, the, unfinished, business, of, exacting, punishment, on, athens, and, eretria, for, supporting, the, revolt, the, ionian, revolt, had, severely, threatened, the, stability, of, darius, s, empire, and, the, states, of, mainland, greece, would, continue, to, threaten, that, stability, unless, dealt, with, darius, thus, began, to, contemplate, the, complete, conquest, of, greece, beginning, with, the, destruction, of, athens, and, eretria, in, the, next, two, decades, there, would, be, two, persian, invasions, of, greece, occasioning, thanks, to, greek, historians, some, of, the, most, famous, battles, in, history, during, the, first, invasion, thrace, macedon, and, the, aegean, islands, were, added, to, the, persian, empire, and, eretria, was, duly, destroyed, however, the, invasion, ended, in, 490, bc, with, the, decisive, athenian, victory, at, the, battle, of, marathon, after, this, invasion, darius, died, and, responsibility, for, the, war, passed, to, his, son, xerxes, i, xerxes, then, personally, led, a, second, persian, invasion, of, greece, in, 480, bc, taking, an, enormous, although, oft, exaggerated, army, and, navy, to, greece, those, greeks, who, chose, to, resist, the, allies, were, defeated, in, the, twin, simultaneous, battles, of, thermopylae, on, land, and, artemisium, at, sea, all, of, greece, except, the, peloponnesus, thus, having, fallen, into, persian, hands, the, persians, then, seeking, to, destroy, the, allied, navy, once, and, for, all, suffered, a, decisive, defeat, at, the, battle, of, salamis, the, following, year, 479, bc, the, allies, assembled, the, largest, greek, army, yet, seen, and, defeated, the, persian, invasion, force, at, the, battle, of, plataea, ending, the, invasion, and, the, threat, to, greece, the, allied, fleet, defeated, the, remnants, of, the, persian, fleet, in, the, battle, of, mycale, near, the, island, of, samos, on, the, same, day, as, plataea, according, to, tradition, this, action, marks, the, end, of, the, persian, invasion, and, the, beginning, of, the, next, phase, in, the, greco, persian, wars, the, greek, counterattack, after, mycale, the, greek, cities, of, asia, minor, again, revolted, with, the, persians, now, powerless, to, stop, them, the, allied, fleet, then, sailed, to, the, thracian, chersonese, still, held, by, the, persians, and, besieged, and, captured, the, town, of, sestos, the, following, year, 478, bc, the, allies, sent, a, force, to, capture, the, city, of, byzantion, modern, day, istanbul, the, siege, was, successful, but, the, behaviour, of, the, spartan, general, pausanias, alienated, many, of, the, allies, and, resulted, in, pausanias, s, recall, after, byzantion, sparta, was, eager, to, end, its, involvement, in, the, war, the, spartans, greatly, feared, the, rise, of, the, athenians, as, a, challenge, to, their, power, additionally, the, spartans, were, of, the, view, that, with, the, liberation, of, mainland, greece, and, the, greek, cities, of, asia, minor, the, war, s, purpose, had, already, been, achieved, there, was, also, perhaps, a, feeling, that, establishing, long, term, security, for, the, asian, greeks, would, prove, impossible, in, the, aftermath, of, mycale, the, spartan, king, leotychidas, had, proposed, transplanting, all, the, greeks, from, asia, minor, to, europe, as, the, only, method, of, permanently, freeing, them, from, persian, dominion, xanthippus, the, athenian, commander, at, mycale, had, furiously, rejected, this, the, ionian, cities, had, been, athenian, colonies, and, the, athenians, if, no, one, else, would, protect, the, ionians, this, marked, the, point, at, which, the, leadership, of, the, greek, alliance, effectively, passed, to, the, athenians, with, the, spartan, withdrawal, after, byzantion, the, leadership, of, the, athenians, became, explicit, the, loose, alliance, of, city, states, which, had, fought, against, xerxes, s, invasion, had, been, dominated, by, sparta, and, the, peloponnesian, league, with, the, withdrawal, of, these, states, a, congress, was, called, on, the, holy, island, of, delos, to, institute, a, new, alliance, to, continue, the, fight, against, the, persians, hence, the, modern, designation, delian, league, according, to, thucydides, the, official, aim, of, the, league, was, to, avenge, the, wrongs, they, suffered, by, ravaging, the, territory, of, the, king, in, reality, this, goal, was, divided, into, three, main, efforts, to, prepare, for, future, invasion, to, seek, revenge, against, persia, and, to, organize, a, means, of, dividing, spoils, of, war, the, members, were, given, a, choice, of, either, offering, armed, forces, or, paying, a, tax, to, the, joint, treasury, most, states, chose, the, tax, league, members, swore, to, have, the, same, friends, and, enemies, and, dropped, ingots, of, iron, into, the, sea, to, symbolize, the, permanence, of, their, alliance, the, athenian, politician, aristides, would, spend, the, rest, of, his, life, occupied, in, the, affairs, of, the, alliance, dying, according, to, plutarch, a, few, years, later, in, pontus, whilst, determining, what, the, tax, of, new, members, was, to, be, the, delian, league, also, known, as, the, athenian, empire, was, a, collection, of, greek, city, states, largely, based, around, the, aegean, sea, which, operated, under, the, hegemony, of, athens, this, alliance, initially, served, the, purpose, of, coordinating, a, united, greek, front, against, a, perceived, looming, persian, threat, against, the, ionian, city, states, which, bordered, it, the, members, of, the, delian, league, were, made, to, swear, an, oath, of, loyalty, to, the, league, and, contributed, mostly, monetarily, but, in, some, instances, donated, ships, or, other, forces, it, was, also, the, case, that, many, democratic, members, of, the, league, owed, their, freedom, from, oligarchic, or, tyrannical, rule, to, athens, because, of, this, athens, gained, an, overwhelming, advantage, in, the, voting, system, conducted, by, relying, on, the, support, of, democratic, city, states, athens, had, helped, into, being, by, 454, athens, moved, the, treasury, of, the, delian, league, from, the, island, of, delos, to, the, parthenon, in, athens, benefitting, greatly, from, the, influx, of, cash, coming, out, of, the, 150, 330, members, athens, used, the, money, to, reinforce, its, own, naval, supremacy, and, used, the, remaining, funds, to, embellish, the, city, with, art, and, architecture, in, order, to, maintain, the, new, synoecism, athens, began, using, its, greatly, expanded, military, to, enforce, membership, in, the, league, city, states, who, wished, to, leave, the, alliance, were, punished, by, athens, with, force, such, as, mytilene, and, melos, no, longer, considered, her, allies, athens, eventually, began, to, refer, to, the, members, of, the, delian, league, as, all, the, cities, athens, rules, athens, also, extended, its, authority, over, members, of, the, league, through, judicial, decisions, synoecism, under, the, athenian, empire, was, enforced, by, resolving, matters, of, and, between, states, in, athens, by, courts, composed, of, athenian, citizens, and, enforcing, those, decisions, through, the, athenian, military, in, the, first, ten, years, of, the, league, s, existence, cimon, kimon, forced, karystos, in, euboea, to, join, the, league, conquered, the, island, of, skyros, and, sent, athenian, colonists, there, over, time, especially, with, the, suppression, of, rebellions, athens, exercised, hegemony, over, the, rest, of, the, league, thucydides, describes, how, athens, s, control, over, the, league, grew, of, all, the, causes, of, defection, that, connected, with, arrears, of, tribute, and, vessels, and, with, failure, of, service, was, the, chief, for, the, athenians, were, very, severe, and, exacting, and, made, themselves, offensive, by, applying, the, screw, of, necessity, to, men, who, were, not, used, to, and, in, fact, not, disposed, for, any, continuous, labor, in, some, other, respects, the, athenians, were, not, the, old, popular, rulers, they, had, been, at, first, and, if, they, had, more, than, their, fair, share, of, service, it, was, correspondingly, easy, for, them, to, reduce, any, that, tried, to, leave, the, confederacy, the, athenians, also, arranged, for, the, other, members, of, the, league, to, pay, its, share, of, the, expense, in, money, instead, of, in, ships, and, men, and, for, this, the, subject, city, states, had, themselves, to, blame, their, wish, to, get, out, of, giving, service, making, most, leave, their, homes, thus, while, athens, was, increasing, her, navy, with, the, funds, they, contributed, a, revolt, always, found, itself, without, enough, resources, or, experienced, leaders, for, war, the, first, member, of, the, league, to, attempt, to, secede, was, the, island, of, naxos, in, c, 471, bc, after, being, defeated, naxos, is, believed, based, on, similar, later, revolts, to, have, been, forced, to, tear, down, its, walls, along, with, losing, its, fleet, and, vote, in, the, league, in, 465, bc, athens, founded, the, colony, of, amphipolis, on, the, strymon, river, thasos, a, member, of, the, league, saw, her, interests, in, the, mines, of, mt, pangaion, threatened, and, defected, from, the, league, to, persia, she, called, to, sparta, for, assistance, but, was, denied, as, sparta, was, facing, the, largest, helot, revolt, in, its, history, after, more, than, two, years, of, siege, thasos, surrendered, to, the, athenian, leader, aristides, and, was, forced, back, into, the, league, as, a, result, the, fortification, walls, of, thasos, were, torn, down, and, they, had, to, pay, yearly, tribute, and, fines, additionally, their, land, naval, ships, and, the, mines, of, thasos, were, confiscated, by, athens, the, siege, of, thasos, marks, the, transformation, of, the, delian, league, from, an, alliance, into, in, the, words, of, thucydides, a, hegemony, in, 461, bc, cimon, was, ostracized, and, was, succeeded, in, his, influence, by, democrats, such, as, ephialtes, and, pericles, this, signaled, a, complete, change, in, athenian, foreign, policy, neglecting, the, alliance, with, the, spartans, and, instead, allying, with, her, enemies, argos, and, thessaly, megara, deserted, the, spartan, led, peloponnesian, league, and, allied, herself, with, athens, allowing, construction, of, a, double, line, of, walls, across, the, isthmus, of, corinth, and, protecting, athens, from, attack, from, that, quarter, roughly, a, decade, earlier, due, to, encouragement, from, influential, speaker, themistocles, the, athenians, had, also, constructed, the, long, walls, connecting, their, city, to, the, piraeus, its, port, making, it, effectively, invulnerable, to, attack, by, land, in, 454, bc, the, athenian, general, pericles, moved, the, delian, league, s, treasury, from, delos, to, athens, allegedly, to, keep, it, safe, from, persia, however, plutarch, indicates, that, many, of, pericles, s, rivals, viewed, the, transfer, to, athens, as, usurping, monetary, resources, to, fund, elaborate, building, projects, athens, also, switched, from, accepting, ships, men, and, weapons, as, dues, from, league, members, to, only, accepting, money, the, new, treasury, established, in, athens, was, used, for, many, purposes, not, all, relating, to, the, defence, of, members, of, the, league, it, was, from, tribute, paid, to, the, league, that, pericles, set, to, building, the, parthenon, on, the, acropolis, replacing, an, older, temple, as, well, as, many, other, non, defense, related, expenditures, the, delian, league, was, turning, from, an, alliance, into, an, empire, war, with, the, persians, continued, in, 460, bc, egypt, revolted, under, local, leaders, the, hellenes, called, inaros, and, amyrtaeus, who, requested, aid, from, athens, pericles, led, 250, ships, intended, to, attack, cyprus, to, their, aid, because, it, would, further, damage, persia, after, four, years, however, the, egyptian, rebellion, was, defeated, by, the, achaemenid, general, megabyzus, who, captured, the, greater, part, of, the, athenian, forces, in, fact, according, to, isocrates, the, athenians, and, their, allies, lost, some, 20, 000, men, in, the, expedition, while, modern, estimates, place, the, figure, at, 50, 000, men, and, 250, ships, including, reinforcements, the, remainder, escaped, to, cyrene, and, thence, returned, home, this, was, the, athenians, main, public, reason, for, moving, the, treasury, of, the, league, from, delos, to, athens, further, consolidating, their, control, over, the, league, the, persians, followed, up, their, victory, by, sending, a, fleet, to, re, establish, their, control, over, cyprus, and, 200, ships, were, sent, out, to, counter, them, under, cimon, who, returned, from, ostracism, in, 451, bc, he, died, during, the, blockade, of, citium, though, the, fleet, won, a, double, victory, by, land, and, sea, over, the, persians, off, salamis, cyprus, this, battle, was, the, last, major, one, fought, against, the, persians, many, writers, report, that, a, peace, treaty, known, as, the, peace, of, callias, was, formalized, in, 450, bc, but, some, writers, believe, that, the, treaty, was, a, myth, created, later, to, inflate, the, stature, of, athens, however, an, understanding, was, definitely, reached, enabling, the, athenians, to, focus, their, attention, on, events, in, greece, proper, soon, war, with, the, peloponnesians, broke, out, in, 458, bc, the, athenians, blockaded, the, island, of, aegina, and, simultaneously, defended, megara, from, the, corinthians, by, sending, out, an, army, composed, of, those, too, young, or, old, for, regular, military, service, the, following, year, sparta, sent, an, army, into, boeotia, reviving, the, power, of, thebes, in, order, to, help, hold, the, athenians, in, check, their, return, was, blocked, and, they, resolved, to, march, on, athens, where, the, long, walls, were, not, yet, completed, winning, a, victory, at, the, battle, of, tanagra, all, this, accomplished, however, was, to, allow, them, to, return, home, via, the, megarid, two, months, later, the, athenians, under, myronides, invaded, boeotia, and, winning, the, battle, of, oenophyta, gained, control, of, the, whole, country, except, thebes, reverses, followed, peace, with, persia, in, 449, bc, the, battle, of, coronea, in, 447, bc, led, to, the, abandonment, of, boeotia, euboea, and, megara, revolted, and, while, the, former, was, restored, to, its, status, as, a, tributary, ally, the, latter, was, a, permanent, loss, the, delian, and, peloponnesian, leagues, signed, a, peace, treaty, which, was, set, to, endure, for, thirty, years, it, only, lasted, until, 431, bc, when, the, peloponnesian, war, broke, out, those, who, revolted, unsuccessfully, during, the, war, saw, the, example, made, of, the, mytilenians, the, principal, people, on, lesbos, after, an, unsuccessful, revolt, the, athenians, ordered, the, death, of, the, entire, male, population, after, some, thought, they, rescinded, this, order, and, only, put, to, death, the, leading, 1000, ringleaders, of, the, revolt, and, redistributed, the, land, of, the, entire, island, to, athenian, shareholders, who, were, sent, out, to, reside, on, lesbos, this, type, of, treatment, was, not, reserved, solely, for, those, who, revolted, thucydides, documents, the, example, of, melos, a, small, island, neutral, in, the, war, though, founded, by, spartans, the, melians, were, offered, a, choice, to, join, the, athenians, or, be, conquered, choosing, to, resist, their, town, was, besieged, and, conquered, the, males, were, put, to, death, and, the, women, sold, into, slavery, see, melian, dialogue, by, 454, bc, the, delian, league, could, be, fairly, characterised, as, an, athenian, empire, a, key, event, of, 454, bc, was, the, moving, of, the, treasury, of, the, delian, league, from, delos, to, athens, this, is, often, seen, as, a, key, marker, of, the, transition, from, alliance, to, empire, but, while, it, is, significant, it, is, important, to, view, the, period, as, a, whole, when, considering, the, development, of, athenian, imperialism, and, not, to, focus, on, a, single, event, as, being, the, main, contributor, to, it, at, the, start, of, the, peloponnesian, war, only, chios, and, lesbos, were, left, to, contribute, ships, and, these, states, were, by, now, far, too, weak, to, secede, without, support, lesbos, tried, to, revolt, first, and, failed, completely, chios, the, most, powerful, of, the, original, members, of, the, delian, league, save, athens, was, the, last, to, revolt, and, in, the, aftermath, of, the, syracusan, expedition, enjoyed, success, for, several, years, inspiring, all, of, ionia, to, revolt, athens, was, nonetheless, eventually, able, to, suppress, these, revolts, to, further, strengthen, athens, s, grip, on, its, empire, pericles, in, 450, bc, began, a, policy, of, establishing, kleruchiai, quasi, colonies, that, remained, tied, to, athens, and, which, served, as, garrisons, to, maintain, control, of, the, league, s, vast, territory, furthermore, pericles, employed, a, number, of, offices, to, maintain, athens, empire, proxenoi, who, fostered, good, relations, between, athens, and, league, members, episkopoi, and, archontes, who, oversaw, the, collection, of, tribute, and, hellenotamiai, who, received, the, tribute, on, athens, behalf, athens, s, empire, was, not, very, stable, and, after, 27, years, of, war, the, spartans, aided, by, the, persians, and, athenian, internal, strife, were, able, to, defeat, it, however, it, did, not, remain, defeated, for, long, the, second, athenian, league, a, maritime, self, defense, league, was, founded, in, 377, bc, and, was, led, by, athens, the, athenians, would, never, recover, the, full, extent, of, their, power, and, their, enemies, were, now, far, stronger, and, more, varied
