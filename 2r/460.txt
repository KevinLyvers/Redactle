and, far, from, homogeneous, in, social, status, or, geo, political, outlook, though, many, were, committed, proponents, of, kurdish, nationalism, this, view, was, far, from, ubiquitous, in, 1914, many, kurds, belonged, to, the, ottoman, elite, and, kurds, often, held, high, ranking, and, prominent, offices, within, the, ottoman, state, kurdish, nationalists, hoped, that, the, allies, of, world, war, i, would, aid, them, in, creating, an, independent, kurdish, nation, if, they, were, to, fight, against, the, ottomans, and, undertook, several, uprisings, throughout, the, war, most, of, these, except, for, the, uprisings, of, august, 1917, were, not, supported, by, any, of, the, allied, powers, further, still, many, kurds, rejected, remained, loyal, to, and, fought, on, behalf, of, the, ottoman, empire, the, most, notorious, example, being, the, hamidiye, a, mostly, kurdish, elite, cavalry, division, of, the, ottoman, army, the, hamidiye, fought, for, the, ottomans, in, both, the, caucucus, and, persian, campaigns, and, played, a, significant, role, in, the, armenian, genocide, regions, with, high, armenian, revolutionary, actions, were, targets, for, the, hamidiye, who, referred, to, an, armenian, conspiracy, for, killing, the, armenians, according, to, some, estimates, about, ten, to, twenty, thousand, armenians, were, slaughtered, by, the, hamidiye, units, in, other, instances, local, kurds, joined, with, turkish, forces, not, out, of, loyalty, but, to, share, in, the, spoils, taken, from, armenian, civilians, according, to, historian, raymond, k, vorkian, while, many, nomadic, kurdish, tribes, actively, participated, in, the, genocide, settled, kurds, rarely, did, so, many, kurds, also, opposed, the, genocide, and, undertook, personal, efforts, to, rescue, armenian, civilians, the, caucasus, campaign, comprised, armed, conflicts, between, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, allies, the, forces, of, the, latter, including, azerbaijan, armenia, the,

russian, navy, in, the, black, sea, region, of, the, ottoman, empire, on, 23, february, 1917, the, russian, advance, was, halted, following, the, russian, revolution, and, later, the, disintegrated, russian, caucasus, army, was, replaced, by, the, forces, of, the, newly, established, armenian, state, which, comprised, the, previous, armenian, volunteer, units, and, the, armenian, irregular, units, during, 1918, the, region, also, saw, the, establishment, of, the, central, caspian, dictatorship, the, republic, of, mountainous, armenia, and, an, allied, force, named, dunsterforce, which, was, composed, of, elite, troops, drawn, from, the, mesopotamian, and, western, fronts, the, ottoman, empire, and, german, empire, fought, each, other, at, batumi, after, the, arrival, of, the, german, caucasus, expedition, whose, prime, aim, was, to, secure, oil, supplies, on, 3, march, 1918, the, conflict, between, the, ottoman, empire, and, russia, ended, with, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, and, on, 4, june, 1918, the, ottoman, empire, signed, the, treaty, of, batum, with, armenia, however, the, armed, conflicts, extended, as, the, ottoman, empire, continued, to, engage, with,

90, 000, ottoman, troops, were, sent, to, the, eastern, european, front, in, 1916, to, participate, in, operations, in, romania, in, the, balkans, campaign, the, central, powers, asked, for, these, units, to, support, their, operations, against, the, russian, army, later, it, was, concluded, that, the, deployment, was, a, mistake, as, these, forces, would, have, been, better, placed, remaining, to, protect, ottoman, territory, against, the, massive, erzerum, offensive, that, the, russian, army, had, begun, the, relocation, of, troops, to, the, eastern, european, front, was, initiated, by, enver, it, was, originally, rejected, by, the, german, chief, of, staff, erich, von, falkenhayn, but, his, successor, paul, von, hindenburg, agreed, to, it, albeit, with, reservations, the, decision, was, reached, after, the, brusilov, offensive, as, the, central, powers, were, running, short, of, men, on, the, eastern, front, in, the, deployment, enver, sent, the, xv, army, corps, to, galicia,

in, the, romanian, campaign, and, were, particularly, valued, for, their, ability, to, continue, a, high, rate, of, advance, in, harsh, winter, conditions, the, xv, corps, was, known, to, fight, very, well, against, the, russians, in, galicia, often, inflicting, on, the, russians, several, times, the, casualties, they, took, after, the, young, turk, revolution, and, the, establishment, of, the,

host, of, problems, in, assembling, itself, first, of, all, the, size, of, the, ottoman, army, was, severely, limited, by, division, within, the, empire, non, muslims, were, exempt, from, the, military, draft, and, reliable, ethnic, turks, made, up, only, 12, million, of, the, empire, s, already, relatively, small, population, of, 22, million, with, the, other, 10, million, being, minorities, of, varying, loyalty, and, military, use, the, empire, was, also, very, poor, compared, to, the, other, powers, in, gdp, infrastructure, and, industrial, capacity, as, a, point, of, comparison, the, empire, had, only, 5, 759, km, of, railway, while, france, had, 51, 000, km, of, railway, for, a, fifth, of, the, land, area, ottoman, coal, production, was, negligible, 826, 000, tons, in, 1914, compared, to, 40, 000, 000, tons, for, france, and, 292, 000, 000, tons, for, britain, while, steel, production, was, borderline, non, existent, there, was, only, one, cannon, and, small, arms, foundry, in, the, empire, a, single, shell, and, bullet, factory, and, a, single, gunpowder, factory, all, of, which, were, located, in, the, constantinople, suburbs, the, ottoman, economy, was, almost, entirely, agricultural, relying, on, products, such, as, wool, cotton, and, hides, during, this, period, the, empire, divided, its, forces, into, armies, each, army, headquarters, consisted, of, a, chief, of, staff, an, operations, section, intelligence, section, logistics, section, and, a, personnel, section, as, a, long, established, tradition, in, the, ottoman, military, supply, medical, and, veterinary, services, were, included, in, these, armies, before, the, war, the, turkish, general, staff, estimated, that, 1, 000, 000, men, could, be, mobilized, at, one, time, and, that, 500, 000, of, these, were, available, as, mobile, field, armies, with, the, rest, serving, in, garrisons, coastal, defenses, and, in, servicing, lines, of, communication, and, transportation, approximately, 900, field, guns, were, available, for, the, mobile, army, which, was, 280, below, war, establishment, though, supplies, of, howitzers, were, generally, sufficient, there, were, an, additional, 900, pieces, of, fixed, or, semifixed, set, up, in, coastal, and, fortress, garrisons, across, adrianople, erzurum, the, bosphorous, the, dardanelles, and, the, catalca,

forces, into, corps, and, divisions, such, that, each, division, had, three, infantry, regiments, and, an, artillery, regiment, the, main, units, were, first, army, with, fifteen, divisions, second,

established, from, scratch, and, were, essentially, new, divisions, in, a, very, short, time, eight, of, these, newly, recruited, divisions, went, through, major, redeployment, during, the, war, more, armies, were, established, 5th, army, and, 6th, army, in, 1915, 7th, army, and, 8th, army, in, 1917, and, kuva, i, nzibatiye, and, the, army, of, islam, which, had, only, a, single, corps, in, 1918, by, 1918, the, original, armies, had, been, so, badly, reduced, that, the, empire, was, forced, to, establish, new, unit, definitions, which, incorporated, these, armies, these, were, the, eastern, army, group, and, yildirim, army, group, however, although, the, number, of, armies, was, increasing, over, the, four, years, of, the, war, the, empire, s, resources, of, manpower, and, supplies, were, declining, so, that, the, army, groups, in, 1918, were, smaller, than, the, armies, of, 1914, the, ottoman, army, was, still, partially, effective, until, the, end, of, the, war, most, military, equipment, was, manufactured, in, germany, or, austria, and, maintained, by, german, and, austrian, engineers, germany, also, supplied, most, of, the, military, advisers, a, force, of, specialist, troops, the, asia, korps, was, dispatched, in, 1917, and, increased, to, a, fighting, force, of, two, regiments, in, 1918, the, german, caucasus, expedition, was, established, in, the, formerly, russian, transcaucasia, around, early, 1918, during, the, caucasus, campaign, its, prime, aim, was, to, secure, oil, supplies, for, germany, and, stabilise, a, nascent, pro, german, democratic,

war, the, ottoman, empire, established, a, new, recruitment, law, on, 12, may, 1914, this, lowered, the, conscription, age, from, 20, to, 18, and, abolished, the, redif, or, reserve, system, active, duty, lengths, were, set, at, two, years, for, the, infantry, three, years, for, other, branches, of, the, army, and, five, years, for, the, navy, these, measures, remained, largely, theoretical, during, the, war, traditional, ottoman, forces, depended, on, volunteers, from, the, muslim, population, of, the, empire, additionally, several, groups, and, individuals, in, the, ottoman, society, volunteered, for, active, duty, during, the, world, war, the, major, examples, being, the, mevlevi, and, the, kadiri, there, were, also, units, formed, by, caucasian, and, rumelian, turks, who, took, part, in, the, battles, in, mesopotamia, and, palestine, among, ottoman, forces, volunteers, were, not, only, from, turkic, groups, there, were, also, smaller, numbers, of, arab, and, bedouin, volunteers, who, fought, in, the, campaign, against, the, british, to, capture, the, suez, canal, and, in, mesopotamia, volunteers, were, considered, unreliable, by, the, organised, army, due, to, a, lack, of, training, and, a, perception, of, mainly, mercenary, interests, from, the, arab, and, bedouin, volunteers, heavy, fighting, also, placed, pressure, on, the, ottoman, volunteer, system,

000, armenian, volunteers, expressed, their, readiness, to, take, up, arms, against, the, ottoman, empire, as, early, as, 1914, these, volunteer, units, increased, in, size, during, the, war, to, the, extent, that, boghos, nubar, in, a, public, letter, to, the, paris, peace, conference, in, 1919, stated, that, they, numbered, 150, 000, the, assyrian, people, of, south, east, anatolia, northern,

supporting, the, breakaway, minded, tribes, and, regional, challengers, to, the, ottoman, government, s, centralised, rule, of, their, empire, would, pay, great, dividends, in, the, diversion, of,

devoted, to, sponsoring, it, germany, established, its, own, intelligence, bureau, for, the, east, just, before, the, outbreak, of, war, it, was, dedicated, to, promoting, and, sustaining, subversive, and, nationalist, agitations, in, the, british, indian, empire, as, well, as, in, the, persian, and, egyptian, satellite, states, its, operations, in, persia, aimed, at, fomenting, trouble, for, the,

which, the, fourth, army, was, to, attack, egypt, and, the, third, army, would, launch, an, offensive, against, the, russians, in, eastern, anatolia, there, was, opposition, to, schellendorf, among, the, ottoman, army, the, most, voiced, opinion, was, that, schellendorf, planned, a, war, which, benefitted, germany, rather, than, taking, into, account, the, conditions, of, the, ottoman, empire, hafiz, hakki, pasha, presented, an, alternative, plan, which, was, more, aggressive, and, concentrated, on, russia, it, was, based, on, moving, forces, by, sea, to, the, eastern, black, sea, coast, where, they, would, develop, an, offensive, against, russian, territory, hafiz, hakki, pasha, s, plan, was, shelved, because, the, ottoman, army, lacked, the, resources, schellendorf, s, primary, campaign, plan, was, therefore, adopted, by, default, as, a, result, of, schellendorf, s, plan, most, of, the, ottoman, operations, were, fought, in, ottoman, territory, with, the, result, that, in, many, cases, they, directly, affected, the, empire, s, own, people, the, later, view, was, that, the, resources, to, implement, this, plan, were, also, lacking, but, schellendorf, organised, the, command, and, control, of, the, army, better, and, positioned, the, army, to, execute, the, plans, schellendorf, also, produced, a, better, mobilisation, plan, for, raising, forces, and, preparing,
