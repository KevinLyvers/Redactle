https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andean_civilizations
the, andean, civilizations, were, south, american, complex, societies, of, many, indigenous, people, they, stretched, down, the, spine, of, the, andes, for, 4, 000, km, 2, 500, mi, from, southern, colombia, to, ecuador, and, peru, including, the, deserts, of, coastal, peru, to, north, chile, and, northwest, argentina, archaeologists, believe, that, andean, civilizations, first, developed, on, the, narrow, coastal, plain, of, the, pacific, ocean, the, caral, or, norte, chico, civilization, of, coastal, peru, is, the, oldest, known, civilization, in, the, americas, dating, back, to, 3500, bce, andean, civilizations, are, one, of, at, least, five, civilizations, in, the, world, deemed, by, scholars, to, be, pristine, the, concept, of, a, pristine, civilization, refers, to, a, civilization, that, has, developed, independently, of, external, influences, and, is, not, a, derivative, of, other, civilizations, despite, the, severe, environmental, challenges, of, high, mountains, and, hyper, arid, desert, the, andean, civilizations, domesticated, a, wide, variety, of, crops, some, of, which, such, as, potatoes, peppers, peanuts, manioc, chocolate, and, coca, became, of, worldwide, importance, the, andean, civilizations, were, noteworthy, for, monumental, architecture, an, extensive, road, system, textile, weaving, and, many, unique, characteristics, of, the, societies, they, created, less, than, a, century, prior, to, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, conquerors, the, incas, from, their, homeland, centered, on, the, city, of, cusco, united, most, andean, cultures, into, one, single, empire, that, encompassed, nearly, all, of, what, is, usually, called, andean, civilization, the, timoto, cuica, of, venezuela, remained, outside, the, inca, orbit, the, inca, empire, was, a, patchwork, of, languages, cultures, and, peoples, spanish, rule, ended, or, transformed, many, elements, of, the, andean, civilizations, notably, influencing, religion, and, architecture, after, the, first, humans, who, were, then, arranged, into, hunter, gatherer, tribal, groups, arrived, in, south, america, via, the, isthmus, of, panama, they, spread, out, across, the, continent, with, the, earliest, evidence, for, settlement, in, the, andean, region, dating, to, circa, 15, 000, bce, in, what, archaeologists, call, the, lithic, period, in, the, ensuing, andean, preceramic, period, plants, began, to, be, widely, cultivated, and, first, complex, society, caral, supe, civilization, emerged, at, 3500, bce, and, lasted, until, 1800, bce, also, distinct, religious, centres, emerged, such, as, the, kotosh, religious, tradition, in, the, highlands, this, was, followed, by, the, ceramic, period, various, complex, societies, developed, at, this, time, such, as, chav, n, culture, lasting, from, 900, bce, to, 200, bce, paracas, culture, lasting, from, 800, bce, to, 200, bce, its, successor, nazca, culture, lasting, from, 200, bce, to, 800, ce, the, moche, civilisation, lasting, from, 100, to, 700, wari, and, tiwanaku, empires, with, both, lasting, from, 600, to, 1000, and, chimor, lasting, from, 900, to, 1470, in, later, periods, much, of, the, andean, region, was, conquered, by, the, indigenous, incas, who, in, 1438, founded, the, largest, empire, that, the, americas, had, ever, seen, named, tahuantinsuyu, but, usually, called, the, inca, empire, the, inca, governed, their, empire, from, the, capital, city, of, cuzco, administering, it, along, traditional, andean, lines, the, inca, empire, rose, from, kingdom, of, cuzco, founded, around, 1230, in, the, 16th, century, spanish, colonisers, from, europe, arrived, in, the, andes, eventually, subjugating, the, indigenous, kingdoms, and, incorporating, the, andean, region, into, the, spanish, empire, the, civilization, of, the, andes, was, one, of, six, in, the, world, deemed, by, scholars, to, be, pristine, that, is, indigenous, and, not, derived, from, other, civilizations, due, to, its, isolation, from, other, civilizations, the, indigenous, people, of, the, andes, had, to, come, up, with, their, own, often, unique, solutions, to, environmental, and, societal, challenges, andean, civilization, lacked, several, characteristics, distinguishing, it, from, the, pristine, civilizations, in, the, old, world, and, from, the, mesoamerican, cultures, first, and, perhaps, most, important, andean, civilizations, did, not, have, a, written, language, instead, their, societies, used, the, quipu, a, system, of, knotted, and, colored, strings, to, convey, information, few, quipus, survive, and, they, have, never, been, fully, deciphered, scholars, differ, on, whether, the, knotted, cords, of, the, quipu, were, able, only, to, record, numerical, data, or, could, also, be, used, for, narrative, communication, a, true, system, of, writing, if, it, is, true, writing, it, is, still, unique, because, it, is, not, a, set, of, symbols, but, rather, knotted, strings, the, use, of, the, quipu, dates, back, at, least, to, the, wari, empire, 600, 1000, ce, and, possibly, to, the, much, earlier, civilization, of, caral, norte, chico, of, the, third, millennium, bce, andean, civilizations, also, lacked, wheeled, vehicles, and, draft, animals, people, on, land, traveled, only, by, foot, and, the, transport, of, goods, was, accomplished, by, humans, or, llama, pack, animals, which, could, carry, loads, of, up, to, one, fourth, of, their, weight, a, maximum, of, 45, kilograms, 99, lb, llamas, were, not, big, or, strong, enough, to, be, used, for, plowing, or, as, riding, animals, for, adults, moreover, andean, civilizations, faced, severe, environmental, challenges, the, earliest, civilizations, were, on, the, hyper, arid, desert, coast, of, peru, agriculture, was, possible, only, with, irrigation, in, valleys, crossed, by, rivers, coming, from, the, high, andes, plus, in, a, few, fog, oases, called, lomas, in, the, andes, agriculture, was, limited, by, thin, soils, cold, climate, low, or, seasonal, precipitation, and, a, scarcity, of, flat, land, freezing, temperatures, may, occur, in, every, month, of, the, year, at, altitudes, of, more, than, 3, 000, metres, 9, 800, ft, the, homeland, of, many, of, the, highland, andean, civilizations, finally, the, andean, civilizations, lacked, money, copper, axe, monies, also, called, naipes, and, spondylus, shells, functioned, as, mediums, of, exchange, in, some, areas, especially, coastal, ecuador, but, most, of, the, andes, area, had, economies, organized, on, reciprocity, and, redistribution, rather, than, money, and, markets, these, characteristics, were, especially, notable, during, the, inca, empire, but, originated, in, much, earlier, times, agriculture, in, south, america, may, have, begun, in, coastal, ecuador, with, the, domestication, of, squash, about, 8000, bce, by, the, las, vegas, culture, some, scholars, believe, that, the, earliest, civilizations, on, the, peruvian, coast, initially, relied, more, upon, maritime, resources, than, agriculture, during, the, formative, period, of, their, societies, however, as, in, all, civilizations, until, the, late, 19th, century, agriculture, was, the, principal, occupation, of, the, great, majority, of, the, people, the, greatest, contribution, of, andean, civilization, to, the, modern, world, has, been, the, plants, its, people, domesticated, crops, grown, by, the, andeans, were, often, unique, to, the, region, maize, which, found, its, way, to, the, andes, from, mexico, was, often, the, most, important, crop, at, lower, and, intermediate, elevations, the, andeans, cultivated, an, estimated, 70, different, plants, almost, as, many, as, were, cultivated, in, all, of, europe, and, asia, many, of, these, plants, are, no, longer, cultivated, or, are, minor, crops, but, important, plants, which, were, domesticated, in, or, near, the, andes, include, potatoes, quinoa, tomatoes, chile, peppers, cotton, coca, tobacco, pineapples, peanuts, and, several, varieties, of, beans, animals, domesticated, in, the, andes, were, llamas, and, guinea, pigs, the, challenges, of, the, environment, required, sophisticated, agricultural, technology, unlike, the, middle, east, the, andes, lacked, easily, domesticated, and, large, seeded, plants, such, as, wheat, and, barley, and, large, and, easily, domesticated, animals, such, as, horses, and, cattle, agriculture, on, the, desert, coast, required, the, development, of, irrigation, in, the, mountains, the, elevation, cold, climate, and, steep, terrain, required, a, range, of, technological, solutions, such, as, terraces, and, n, exploitation, of, microclimates, and, selective, breeding, due, to, the, climatic, uncertainties, farmers, traditionally, farmed, several, crops, at, several, elevations, and, exposures, at, a, macro, level, societies, and, states, did, the, same, with, the, vertical, archipelago, establishing, colonies, at, different, elevations, and, locations, to, increase, the, possibilities, of, agricultural, success, the, norte, chico, civilization, also, called, caral, was, a, complex, pre, columbian, society, that, included, as, many, as, 30, major, population, centers, in, what, is, now, the, norte, chico, region, of, north, central, coastal, peru, it, is, the, oldest, known, civilization, in, the, americas, and, one, of, the, cradles, of, civilization, where, civilization, separately, originated, in, the, ancient, world, it, flourished, between, the, 30th, century, bce, and, the, 18th, century, bce, the, alternative, name, caral, supe, is, derived, from, the, sacred, city, of, caral, in, the, supe, valley, a, large, and, well, studied, norte, chico, site, complex, society, in, norte, chico, arose, a, millennium, after, sumer, in, mesopotamia, was, contemporaneous, with, the, egyptian, pyramids, and, predated, the, mesoamerican, olmec, by, nearly, two, millennia, the, valdivia, culture, is, one, of, the, oldest, settled, cultures, recorded, in, the, americas, it, emerged, from, the, earlier, las, vegas, culture, and, thrived, on, the, santa, elena, peninsula, near, the, modern, day, town, of, valdivia, ecuador, between, 3500, bce, and, 1800, bce, the, chav, n, culture, is, thought, to, have, been, primarily, a, religious, movement, the, culture, apparently, began, in, the, peruvian, highlands, and, then, spread, outward, throughout, the, country, the, chav, n, culture, has, very, distinctive, art, styles, particularly, in, effigy, pots, a, number, of, which, were, in, feline, shapes, chavin, de, huantar, was, an, important, ritual, centre, for, chavin, culture, dating, to, around, 1, 500, bce, the, nazca, culture, also, nasca, was, the, archaeological, culture, that, flourished, from, 100, to, 800, ce, beside, the, dry, southern, coast, of, peru, in, the, river, valleys, of, the, rio, grande, de, nazca, drainage, and, the, ica, valley, silverman, and, proulx, 2002, having, been, heavily, influenced, by, the, preceding, paracas, culture, which, was, known, for, extremely, complex, textiles, the, nazca, produced, an, array, of, beautiful, crafts, and, technologies, such, as, ceramics, textiles, and, geoglyphs, most, commonly, known, as, the, nazca, lines, they, also, built, an, impressive, system, of, underground, aqueducts, known, as, puquios, that, still, function, today, the, nazca, province, in, the, ica, region, was, named, for, this, people, the, moche, civilization, alternately, the, mochica, culture, early, chimu, pre, chimu, proto, chimu, etc, flourished, in, northern, peru, from, about, 100, ce, to, 800, ce, during, the, regional, development, epoch, while, this, issue, is, the, subject, of, some, debate, many, scholars, contend, that, the, moche, were, not, politically, organized, as, a, monolithic, empire, or, state, rather, they, were, likely, a, group, of, autonomous, polities, that, shared, a, common, elite, culture, as, seen, in, the, rich, iconography, and, monumental, architecture, that, survive, today, they, are, particularly, noted, for, their, elaborately, painted, ceramics, gold, work, monumental, constructions, huacas, and, irrigation, systems, moche, history, may, be, broadly, divided, into, three, periods, the, emergence, of, the, moche, culture, in, early, moche, ce, 100, 300, its, expansion, and, florescence, during, middle, moche, ce, 300, 600, and, the, urban, nucleation, and, subsequent, collapse, in, late, moche, ce, 500, 750, the, chachapoyas, or, the, cloud, people, were, an, andean, civilization, living, in, cloud, forests, of, the, amazonas, region, of, present, day, northern, peru, the, incas, conquered, the, chachapoyas, shortly, before, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, in, peru, the, first, firm, evidence, of, their, existence, dates, back, to, around, 700, ce, although, it, is, possible, that, they, built, a, settlement, called, gran, paj, ten, where, some, ceramics, have, been, dated, to, 200, bce, the, largest, chacapoyan, site, discovered, so, far, is, kuelap, a, number, of, mummified, burial, sites, have, also, been, discovered, the, wari, spanish, huari, were, a, middle, horizon, civilization, that, flourished, in, the, south, central, andes, and, coastal, area, of, peru, from, about, ce, 500, to, 1000, the, wari, culture, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, modern, ethnic, group, and, language, known, as, wari, with, which, it, has, no, known, link, wari, as, the, former, capital, city, was, called, is, located, 11, km, 6, 8, mi, north, east, of, the, city, of, ayacucho, this, city, was, the, center, of, a, civilization, that, covered, much, of, the, highlands, and, coast, of, peru, the, best, preserved, remnants, beside, the, wari, ruins, are, the, recently, discovered, northern, wari, ruins, near, the, city, of, chiclayo, and, cerro, baul, in, moquegua, also, well, known, are, the, wari, ruins, of, pikillaqta, flea, town, a, short, distance, south, east, of, cuzco, en, route, to, lake, titicaca, tiwanaku, spanish, tiahuanaco, and, tiahuanacu, is, an, important, pre, columbian, archaeological, site, in, western, bolivia, south, america, tiwanaku, is, recognized, by, andean, scholars, as, one, of, the, most, important, precursors, to, the, inca, empire, flourishing, as, the, ritual, and, administrative, capital, of, a, major, state, power, for, approximately, five, hundred, years, the, ruins, of, the, ancient, city, state, are, near, the, south, eastern, shore, of, lake, titicaca, in, the, la, paz, department, ingavi, province, tiwanaku, municipality, about, 72, km, 45, mi, west, of, la, paz, the, site, was, first, recorded, in, written, history, by, spanish, conquistador, and, self, acclaimed, first, chronicler, of, the, indies, pedro, cieza, de, le, n, leon, stumbled, upon, the, remains, of, tiwanaku, in, 1549, while, searching, for, the, inca, capital, qullasuyu, some, have, hypothesized, that, tiwanaku, s, modern, name, is, related, to, the, aymara, term, taypiqala, meaning, stone, in, the, center, alluding, to, the, belief, that, it, lay, at, the, center, of, the, world, however, the, name, by, which, tiwanaku, was, known, to, its, inhabitants, may, have, been, lost, as, the, people, of, tiwanaku, had, no, written, language, the, chim, were, the, residents, of, chimor, with, its, capital, at, the, city, of, chan, chan, a, large, adobe, city, in, the, moche, valley, of, present, day, trujillo, peru, the, culture, arose, about, 900, ce, the, inca, ruler, topa, inca, yupanqui, led, a, campaign, which, conquered, the, chim, around, 1470, ce, this, was, just, fifty, years, before, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, in, the, region, consequently, spanish, chroniclers, were, able, to, record, accounts, of, chim, culture, from, individuals, who, had, lived, before, the, inca, conquest, similarly, archaeological, evidence, suggest, chimor, grew, out, of, the, remnants, of, moche, culture, early, chim, pottery, had, some, resemblance, to, that, of, the, moche, their, ceramics, are, all, black, and, their, work, in, precious, metals, is, very, detailed, and, intricate, the, aymara, kingdoms, were, a, group, of, lordships, located, in, the, altiplano, the, kingdoms, were, established, around, 1151, after, the, collapse, of, the, tiwanaku, empire, until, they, were, absorbed, into, the, inca, empire, in, 1477, the, inca, empire, or, incan, empire, quechua, tawantinsuyu, was, the, largest, empire, in, pre, columbian, america, the, administrative, political, and, military, center, of, the, empire, was, located, in, cusco, the, inca, civilization, arose, from, the, peruvian, highlands, sometime, in, the, early, 13th, century, and, the, last, inca, stronghold, was, conquered, by, the, spanish, in, 1572, from, 1438, to, 1533, ce, the, incas, used, a, variety, of, methods, from, conquest, to, peaceful, assimilation, to, incorporate, a, large, portion, of, western, south, america, centered, on, the, andean, mountain, ranges, including, peru, southwest, ecuador, western, and, south, central, bolivia, northwest, argentina, northern, chile, and, a, small, part, of, southwest, colombia, into, a, state, comparable, to, the, historical, empires, of, the, old, world, the, diaguita, culture, formed, in, 1000, ce, after, emerging, from, the, las, nimas, culture, the, calchaqu, tribe, fought, against, expansion, by, both, the, inca, empire, and, the, spanish, empire, until, they, surrendered, to, spanish, rule, after, their, defeat,

encountered, by, the, troops, of, gonzalo, jim, nez, de, quesada, in, name, of, the, spanish, empire, at, the, time, of, the, conquest, in, the, spring, of, 1537, the, muisca, comprised, two, confederations, hunza, present, day, tunja, was, located, in, the, northern, area, whose, sovereign, was, the, zaque, and, bacat, the, southern, area, whose, sovereign, was, the, zipa, both,
