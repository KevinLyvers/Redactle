physics, is, a, branch, of, science, whose, primary, objects, of, study, are, matter, and, energy, discoveries, of, physics, find, applications, throughout, the, natural, sciences, and, in, technology, historically, physics, emerged, from, the, scientific, revolution, of, the, 17th, century, grew, rapidly, in, the, 19th, century, then, was, transformed, by, a, series, of, discoveries, in, the, 20th, century, physics, today, may, be, divided, loosely, into, classical, physics, and, modern, physics, many, detailed, articles, on, specific, topics, are, available, through, the, outline, of, the, history, of, physics, elements, of, what, became, physics, were, drawn, primarily, from, the, fields, of, astronomy, optics, and, mechanics, which, were, methodologically, united, through, the, study, of, geometry, these, mathematical, disciplines, began, in, antiquity, with, the, babylonians, and, with, hellenistic, writers, such, as, archimedes, and, ptolemy, ancient, philosophy, meanwhile, included, what, was, called, physics, the, move, towards, a, rational, understanding, of, nature, began, at, least, since, the, archaic, period, in, greece, 650, 480, bce, with, the, pre, socratic, philosophers, the, philosopher, thales, of, miletus, 7th, and, 6th, centuries, bce, dubbed, the, father, of, science, for, refusing, to, accept, various, supernatural, religious, or, mythological, explanations, for, natural, phenomena, proclaimed, that, every, event, had, a, natural, cause, thales, also, made, advancements, in, 580, bce, by, suggesting, that, water, is, the, basic, element, experimenting, with, the, attraction, between, magnets, and, rubbed, amber, and, formulating, the, first, recorded, cosmologies, anaximander, developer, of, a, proto, evolutionary, theory, disputed, thales, ideas, and, proposed, that, rather, than, water, a, substance, called, apeiron, was, the, building, block, of, all, matter, around, 500, bce, heraclitus, proposed, that, the, only, basic, law, governing, the, universe, was, the, principle, of, change, and, that, nothing, remains, in, the, same, state, indefinitely, along, with, his, contemporary, parmenides, were, among, the, first, scholars, in, ancient, physics, to, contemplate, on, the, role, of, time, in, the, universe, a, key, concept, that, is, still, an, issue, in, modern, physics, during, the, classical, period, in, greece, 6th, 5th, and, 4th, centuries, bce, and, in, hellenistic, times, natural, philosophy, slowly, developed, into, an, exciting, and, contentious, field, of, study, aristotle, greek, aristot, l, s, 384, 322, bce, a, student, of, plato, promoted, the, concept, that, observation, of, physical, phenomena, could, ultimately, lead, to, the, discovery, of, the, natural, laws, governing, them, aristotle, s, writings, cover, physics, metaphysics, poetry, theater, music, logic, rhetoric, linguistics, politics, government, ethics, biology, and, zoology, he, wrote, the, first, work, which, refers, to, that, line, of, study, as, physics, in, the, 4th, century, bce, aristotle, founded, the, system, known, as, aristotelian, physics, he, attempted, to, explain, ideas, such, as, motion, and, gravity, with, the, theory, of, four, elements, aristotle, believed, that, all, matter, was, made, up, of, aether, or, some, combination, of, four, elements, earth, water, air, and, fire, according, to, aristotle, these, four, terrestrial, elements, are, capable, of, inter, transformation, and, move, toward, their, natural, place, so, a, stone, falls, downward, toward, the, center, of, the, cosmos, but, flames, rise, upward, toward, the, circumference, eventually, aristotelian, physics, became, enormously, popular, for, many, centuries, in, europe, informing, the, scientific, and, scholastic, developments, of, the, middle, ages, it, remained, the, mainstream, scientific, paradigm, in, europe, until, the, time, of, galileo, galilei, and, isaac, newton, early, in, classical, greece, knowledge, that, the, earth, is, spherical, round, was, common, around, 240, bce, as, the, result, of, a, seminal, experiment, eratosthenes, 276, 194, bce, accurately, estimated, its, circumference, in, contrast, to, aristotle, s, geocentric, views, aristarchus, of, samos, greek, c, 310, c, 230, bce, presented, an, explicit, argument, for, a, heliocentric, model, of, the, solar, system, i, e, for, placing, the, sun, not, the, earth, at, its, centre, seleucus, of, seleucia, a, follower, of, aristarchus, heliocentric, theory, stated, that, the, earth, rotated, around, its, own, axis, which, in, turn, revolved, around, the, sun, though, the, arguments, he, used, were, lost, plutarch, stated, that, seleucus, was, the, first, to, prove, the, heliocentric, system, through, reasoning, in, the, 3rd, century, bce, the, greek, mathematician, archimedes, of, syracuse, greek, 287, 212, bce, generally, considered, to, be, the, greatest, mathematician, of, antiquity, and, one, of, the, greatest, of, all, time, laid, the, foundations, of, hydrostatics, statics, and, calculated, the, underlying, mathematics, of, the, lever, a, leading, scientist, of, classical, antiquity, archimedes, also, developed, elaborate, systems, of, pulleys, to, move, large, objects, with, a, minimum, of, effort, the, archimedes, screw, underpins, modern, hydroengineering, and, his, machines, of, war, helped, to, hold, back, the, armies, of, rome, in, the, first, punic, war, archimedes, even, tore, apart, the, arguments, of, aristotle, and, his, metaphysics, pointing, out, that, it, was, impossible, to, separate, mathematics, and, nature, and, proved, it, by, converting, mathematical, theories, into, practical, inventions, furthermore, in, his, work, on, floating, bodies, around, 250, bce, archimedes, developed, the, law, of, buoyancy, also, known, as, archimedes, principle, in, mathematics, archimedes, used, the, method, of, exhaustion, to, calculate, the, area, under, the, arc, of, a, parabola, with, the, summation, of, an, infinite, series, and, gave, a, remarkably, accurate, approximation, of, pi, he, also, defined, the, spiral, bearing, his, name, formulae, for, the, volumes, of, surfaces, of, revolution, and, an, ingenious, system, for, expressing, very, large, numbers, he, also, developed, the, principles, of, equilibrium, states, and, centers, of, gravity, ideas, that, would, influence, future, scholars, like, galileo, and, newton, hipparchus, 190, 120, bce, focusing, on, astronomy, and, mathematics, used, sophisticated, geometrical, techniques, to, map, the, motion, of, the, stars, and, planets, even, predicting, the, times, that, solar, eclipses, would, happen, he, added, calculations, of, the, distance, of, the, sun, and, moon, from, the, earth, based, upon, his, improvements, to, the, observational, instruments, used, at, that, time, another, of, the, early, physicists, was, ptolemy, 90, 168, ce, one, of, the, leading, minds, during, the, time, of, the, roman, empire, ptolemy, was, the, author, of, several, scientific, treatises, at, least, three, of, which, were, of, continuing, importance, to, later, islamic, and, european, science, the, first, is, the, astronomical, treatise, now, known, as, the, almagest, in, greek, the, great, treatise, originally, mathematical, treatise, the, second, is, the, geography, which, is, a, thorough, discussion, of, the, geographic, knowledge, of, the, greco, roman, world, much, of, the, accumulated, knowledge, of, the, ancient, world, was, lost, even, of, the, works, of, the, many, respectable, thinkers, few, fragments, survived, although, he, wrote, at, least, fourteen, books, almost, nothing, of, hipparchus, direct, work, survived, of, the, 150, reputed, aristotelian, works, only, 30, exist, and, some, of, those, are, little, more, than, lecture, notes, important, physical, and, mathematical, traditions, also, existed, in, ancient, chinese, and, indian, sciences, in, indian, philosophy, maharishi, kanada, was, the, first, to, systematically, develop, a, theory, of, atomism, around, 200, bce, though, some, authors, have, allotted, him, an, earlier, era, in, the, 6th, century, bce, it, was, further, elaborated, by, the, buddhist, atomists, dharmakirti, and, dign, ga, during, the, 1st, millennium, ce, pakudha, kaccayana, a, 6th, century, bce, indian, philosopher, and, contemporary, of, gautama, buddha, had, also, propounded, ideas, about, the, atomic, constitution, of, the, material, world, these, philosophers, believed, that, other, elements, except, ether, were, physically, palpable, and, hence, comprised, minuscule, particles, of, matter, the, last, minuscule, particle, of, matter, that, could, not, be, subdivided, further, was, termed, parmanu, these, philosophers, considered, the, atom, to, be, indestructible, and, hence, eternal, the, buddhists, thought, atoms, to, be, minute, objects, unable, to, be, seen, to, the, naked, eye, that, come, into, being, and, vanish, in, an, instant, the, vaisheshika, school, of, philosophers, believed, that, an, atom, was, a, mere, point, in, space, it, was, also, first, to, depict, relations, between, motion, and, force, applied, indian, theories, about, the, atom, are, greatly, abstract, and, enmeshed, in, philosophy, as, they, were, based, on, logic, and, not, on, personal, experience, or, experimentation, in, indian, astronomy, aryabhata, s, aryabhatiya, 499, ce, proposed, the, earth, s, rotation, while, nilakantha, somayaji, 1444, 1544, of, the, kerala, school, of, astronomy, and, mathematics, proposed, a, semi, heliocentric, model, resembling, the, tychonic, system, the, study, of, magnetism, in, ancient, china, dates, back, to, the, 4th, century, bce, in, the, book, of, the, devil, valley, master, a, main, contributor, to, this, field, was, shen, kuo, 1031, 1095, a, polymath, and, statesman, who, was, the, first, to, describe, the, magnetic, needle, compass, used, for, navigation, as, well, as, establishing, the, concept, of, true, north, in, optics, shen, kuo, independently, developed, a, camera, obscura, in, the, 7th, to, 15th, centuries, scientific, progress, occurred, in, the, muslim, world, many, classic, works, in, indian, assyrian, sassanian, persian, and, greek, including, the, works, of, aristotle, were, translated, into, arabic, important, contributions, were, made, by, ibn, al, haytham, 965, 1040, an, arab, or, persian, scientist, considered, to, be, a, founder, of, modern, optics, ptolemy, and, aristotle, theorised, that, light, either, shone, from, the, eye, to, illuminate, objects, or, that, forms, emanated, from, objects, themselves, whereas, al, haytham, known, by, the, latin, name, alhazen, suggested, that, light, travels, to, the, eye, in, rays, from, different, points, on, an, object, the, works, of, ibn, al, haytham, and, al, biruni, 973, 1050, a, persian, scientist, eventually, passed, on, to, western, europe, where, they, were, studied, by, scholars, such, as, roger, bacon, and, vitello, ibn, al, haytham, used, controlled, experiments, in, his, work, on, optics, although, to, what, extent, it, differed, from, ptolemy, is, up, to, debate, arabic, mechanics, like, b, r, n, and, al, khazini, developed, sophisticated, science, of, weight, carrying, out, measurements, of, specific, weights, and, volumes, ibn, s, n, 980, 1037, known, as, avicenna, was, a, polymath, from, bukhara, in, present, day, uzbekistan, responsible, for, important, contributions, to, physics, optics, philosophy, and, medicine, he, published, his, theory, of, motion, in, book, of, healing, 1020, where, he, argued, that, an, impetus, is, imparted, to, a, projectile, by, the, thrower, he, viewed, it, as, persistent, requiring, external, forces, such, as, air, resistance, to, dissipate, it, ibn, sina, made, a, distinction, between, force, and, inclination, called, mayl, and, argued, that, an, object, gained, mayl, when, the, object, is, in, opposition, to, its, natural, motion, he, concluded, that, continuation, of, motion, is, attributed, to, the, inclination, that, is, transferred, to, the, object, and, that, object, will, be, in, motion, until, the, mayl, is, spent, this, conception, of, motion, is, consistent, with, newton, s, first, law, of, motion, inertia, which, states, that, an, object, in, motion, will, stay, in, motion, unless, it, is, acted, on, by, an, external, force, this, idea, which, dissented, from, the, aristotelian, view, was, later, described, as, impetus, by, john, buridan, who, was, likely, influenced, by, ibn, sina, s, book, of, healing, hibat, allah, abu, l, barakat, al, baghdaadi, c, 1080, c, 1165, adopted, and, modified, ibn, sina, s, theory, on, projectile, motion, in, his, kitab, al, mu, tabar, abu, l, barakat, stated, that, the, mover, imparts, a, violent, inclination, mayl, qasri, on, the, moved, and, that, this, diminishes, as, the, moving, object, distances, itself, from, the, mover, he, also, proposed, an, explanation, of, the, acceleration, of, falling, bodies, by, the, accumulation, of, successive, increments, of, power, with, successive, increments, of, velocity, according, to, shlomo, pines, al, baghdaadi, s, theory, of, motion, was, the, oldest, negation, of, aristotle, s, fundamental, dynamic, law, anticipation, in, a, vague, fashion, of, the, fundamental, law, of, classical, mechanics, jean, buridan, and, albert, of, saxony, later, referred, to, abu, l, barakat, in, explaining, that, the, acceleration, of, a, falling, body, is, a, result, of, its, increasing, impetus, ibn, bajjah, c, 1085, 1138, known, as, avempace, in, europe, proposed, that, for, every, force, there, is, always, a, reaction, force, ibn, bajjah, was, a, critic, of, ptolemy, and, he, worked, on, creating, a, new, theory, of, velocity, to, replace, the, one, theorized, by, aristotle, two, future, philosophers, supported, the, theories, avempace, created, known, as, avempacean, dynamics, these, philosophers, were, thomas, aquinas, a, catholic, priest, and, john, duns, scotus, galileo, went, on, to, adopt, avempace, s, formula, that, the, velocity, of, a, given, object, is, the, difference, of, the, motive, power, of, that, object, and, the, resistance, of, the, medium, of, motion, nasir, al, din, al, tusi, 1201, 1274, a, persian, astronomer, and, mathematician, who, died, in, baghdad, introduced, the, tusi, couple, copernicus, later, drew, heavily, on, the, work, of, al, din, al, tusi, and, his, students, but, without, acknowledgment, awareness, of, ancient, works, re, entered, the, west, through, translations, from, arabic, to, latin, their, re, introduction, combined, with, judeo, islamic, theological, commentaries, had, a, great, influence, on, medieval, philosophers, such, as, thomas, aquinas, scholastic, european, scholars, who, sought, to, reconcile, the, philosophy, of, the, ancient, classical, philosophers, with, christian, theology, proclaimed, aristotle, the, greatest, thinker, of, the, ancient, world, in, cases, where, they, did, not, directly, contradict, the, bible, aristotelian, physics, became, the, foundation, for, the, physical, explanations, of, the, european, churches, quantification, became, a, core, element, of, medieval, physics, based, on, aristotelian, physics, scholastic, physics, described, things, as, moving, according, to, their, essential, nature, celestial, objects, were, described, as, moving, in, circles, because, perfect, circular, motion, was, considered, an, innate, property, of, objects, that, existed, in, the, uncorrupted, realm, of, the, celestial, spheres, the, theory, of, impetus, the, ancestor, to, the, concepts, of, inertia, and, momentum, was, developed, along, similar, lines, by, medieval, philosophers, such, as, john, philoponus, and, jean, buridan, motions, below, the, lunar, sphere, were, seen, as, imperfect, and, thus, could, not, be, expected, to, exhibit, consistent, motion, more, idealized, motion, in, the, sublunary, realm, could, only, be, achieved, through, artifice, and, prior, to, the, 17th, century, many, did, not, view, artificial, experiments, as, a, valid, means, of, learning, about, the, natural, world, physical, explanations, in, the, sublunary, realm, revolved, around, tendencies, stones, contained, the, element, earth, and, earthly, objects, tended, to, move, in, a, straight, line, toward, the, centre, of, the, earth, and, the, universe, in, the, aristotelian, geocentric, view, unless, otherwise, prevented, from, doing, so, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, a, large, advancement, of, scientific, progress, known, as, the, scientific, revolution, took, place, in, europe, dissatisfaction, with, older, philosophical, approaches, had, begun, earlier, and, had, produced, other, changes, in, society, such, as, the, protestant, reformation, but, the, revolution, in, science, began, when, natural, philosophers, began, to, mount, a, sustained, attack, on, the, scholastic, philosophical, programme, and, supposed, that, mathematical, descriptive, schemes, adopted, from, such, fields, as, mechanics, and, astronomy, could, actually, yield, universally, valid, characterizations, of, motion, and, other, concepts, a, breakthrough, in, astronomy, was, made, by, polish, astronomer, nicolaus, copernicus, 1473, 1543, when, in, 1543, he, gave, strong, arguments, for, the, heliocentric, model, of, the, solar, system, ostensibly, as, a, means, to, render, tables, charting, planetary, motion, more, accurate, and, to, simplify, their, production, in, heliocentric, models, of, the, solar, system, the, earth, orbits, the, sun, along, with, other, bodies, in, earth, s, galaxy, a, contradiction, according, to, the, greek, egyptian, astronomer, ptolemy, 2nd, century, ce, see, above, whose, system, placed, the, earth, at, the, center, of, the, universe, and, had, been, accepted, for, over, 1, 400, years, the, greek, astronomer, aristarchus, of, samos, c, 310, c, 230, bce, had, suggested, that, the, earth, revolves, around, the, sun, but, copernicus, reasoning, led, to, lasting, general, acceptance, of, this, revolutionary, idea, copernicus, book, presenting, the, theory, de, revolutionibus, orbium, coelestium, on, the, revolutions, of, the, celestial, spheres, was, published, just, before, his, death, in, 1543, and, as, it, is, now, generally, considered, to, mark, the, beginning, of, modern, astronomy, is, also, considered, to, mark, the, beginning, of, the, scientific, revolution, copernicus, new, perspective, along, with, the, accurate, observations, made, by, tycho, brahe, enabled, german, astronomer, johannes, kepler, 1571, 1630, to, formulate, his, laws, regarding, planetary, motion, that, remain, in, use, today, the, italian, mathematician, astronomer, and, physicist, galileo, galilei, 1564, 1642, was, a, supporter, of, copernicanism, who, made, numerous, astronomical, discoveries, carried, out, empirical, experiments, and, improved, the, telescope, as, a, mathematician, galileo, s, role, in, the, university, culture, of, his, era, was, subordinated, to, the, three, major, topics, of, study, law, medicine, and, theology, which, was, closely, allied, to, philosophy, galileo, however, felt, that, the, descriptive, content, of, the, technical, disciplines, warranted, philosophical, interest, particularly, because, mathematical, analysis, of, astronomical, observations, notably, copernicus, analysis, of, the, relative, motions, of, the, sun, earth, moon, and, planets, indicated, that, philosophers, statements, about, the, nature, of, the, universe, could, be, shown, to, be, in, error, galileo, also, performed, mechanical, experiments, insisting, that, motion, itself, regardless, of, whether, it, was, produced, naturally, or, artificially, i, e, deliberately, had, universally, consistent, characteristics, that, could, be, described, mathematically, galileo, s, early, studies, at, the, university, of, pisa, were, in, medicine, but, he, was, soon, drawn, to, mathematics, and, physics, at, 19, he, discovered, and, subsequently, verified, the, isochronal, nature, of, the, pendulum, when, using, his, pulse, he, timed, the, oscillations, of, a, swinging, lamp, in, pisa, s, cathedral, and, found, that, it, remained, the, same, for, each, swing, regardless, of, the, swing, s, amplitude, he, soon, became, known, through, his, invention, of, a, hydrostatic, balance, and, for, his, treatise, on, the, center, of, gravity, of, solid, bodies, while, teaching, at, the, university, of, pisa, 1589, 92, he, initiated, his, experiments, concerning, the, laws, of, bodies, in, motion, that, brought, results, so, contradictory, to, the, accepted, teachings, of, aristotle, that, strong, antagonism, was, aroused, he, found, that, bodies, do, not, fall, with, velocities, proportional, to, their, weights, the, story, in, which, galileo, is, said, to, have, dropped, weights, from, the, leaning, tower, of, pisa, is, apocryphal, but, he, did, find, that, the, path, of, a, projectile, is, a, parabola, and, is, credited, with, conclusions, that, anticipated, newton, s, laws, of, motion, e, g, the, notion, of, inertia, among, these, is, what, is, now, called, galilean, relativity, the, first, precisely, formulated, statement, about, properties, of, space, and, time, outside, three, dimensional, geometry, galileo, has, been, called, the, father, of, modern, observational, astronomy, the, father, of, modern, physics, the, father, of, science, and, the, father, of, modern, science, according, to, stephen, hawking, galileo, perhaps, more, than, any, other, single, person, was, responsible, for, the, birth, of, modern, science, as, religious, orthodoxy, decreed, a, geocentric, or, tychonic, understanding, of, the, solar, system, galileo, s, support, for, heliocentrism, provoked, controversy, and, he, was, tried, by, the, inquisition, found, vehemently, suspect, of, heresy, he, was, forced, to, recant, and, spent, the, rest, of, his, life, under, house, arrest, the, contributions, that, galileo, made, to, observational, astronomy, include, the, telescopic, confirmation, of, the, phases, of, venus, his, discovery, in, 1609, of, jupiter, s, four, largest, moons, subsequently, given, the, collective, name, of, the, galilean, moons, and, the, observation, and, analysis, of, sunspots, galileo, also, pursued, applied, science, and, technology, inventing, among, other, instruments, a, military, compass, his, discovery, of, the, jovian, moons, was, published, in, 1610, and, enabled, him, to, obtain, the, position, of, mathematician, and, philosopher, to, the, medici, court, as, such, he, was, expected, to, engage, in, debates, with, philosophers, in, the, aristotelian, tradition, and, received, a, large, audience, for, his, own, publications, such, as, the, discourses, and, mathematical, demonstrations, concerning, two, new, sciences, published, abroad, following, his, arrest, for, the, publication, of, dialogue, concerning, the, two, chief, world, systems, and, the, assayer, galileo, s, interest, in, experimenting, with, and, formulating, mathematical, descriptions, of, motion, established, experimentation, as, an, integral, part, of, natural, philosophy, this, tradition, combining, with, the, non, mathematical, emphasis, on, the, collection, of, experimental, histories, by, philosophical, reformists, such, as, william, gilbert, and, francis, bacon, drew, a, significant, following, in, the, years, leading, up, to, and, following, galileo, s, death, including, evangelista, torricelli, and, the, participants, in, the, accademia, del, cimento, in, italy, marin, mersenne, and, blaise, pascal, in, france, christiaan, huygens, in, the, netherlands, and, robert, hooke, and, robert, boyle, in, england, the, french, philosopher, ren, descartes, 1596, 1650, was, well, connected, to, and, influential, within, the, experimental, philosophy, networks, of, the, day, descartes, had, a, more, ambitious, agenda, however, which, was, geared, toward, replacing, the, scholastic, philosophical, tradition, altogether, questioning, the, reality, interpreted, through, the, senses, descartes, sought, to, re, establish, philosophical, explanatory, schemes, by, reducing, all, perceived, phenomena, to, being, attributable, to, the, motion, of, an, invisible, sea, of, corpuscles, notably, he, reserved, human, thought, and, god, from, his, scheme, holding, these, to, be, separate, from, the, physical, universe, in, proposing, this, philosophical, framework, descartes, supposed, that, different, kinds, of, motion, such, as, that, of, planets, versus, that, of, terrestrial, objects, were, not, fundamentally, different, but, were, merely, different, manifestations, of, an, endless, chain, of, corpuscular, motions, obeying, universal, principles, particularly, influential, were, his, explanations, for, circular, astronomical, motions, in, terms, of, the, vortex, motion, of, corpuscles, in, space, descartes, argued, in, accord, with, the, beliefs, if, not, the, methods, of, the, scholastics, that, a, vacuum, could, not, exist, and, his, explanation, of, gravity, in, terms, of, corpuscles, pushing, objects, downward, descartes, like, galileo, was, convinced, of, the, importance, of, mathematical, explanation, and, he, and, his, followers, were, key, figures, in, the, development, of, mathematics, and, geometry, in, the, 17th, century, cartesian, mathematical, descriptions, of, motion, held, that, all, mathematical, formulations, had, to, be, justifiable, in, terms, of, direct, physical, action, a, position, held, by, huygens, and, the, german, philosopher, gottfried, leibniz, who, while, following, in, the, cartesian, tradition, developed, his, own, philosophical, alternative, to, scholasticism, which, he, outlined, in, his, 1714, work, the, monadology, descartes, has, been, dubbed, the, father, of, modern, philosophy, and, much, subsequent, western, philosophy, is, a, response, to, his, writings, which, are, studied, closely, to, this, day, in, particular, his, meditations, on, first, philosophy, continues, to, be, a, standard, text, at, most, university, philosophy, departments, descartes, influence, in, mathematics, is, equally, apparent, the, cartesian, coordinate, system, allowing, algebraic, equations, to, be, expressed, as, geometric, shapes, in, a, two, dimensional, coordinate, system, was, named, after, him, he, is, credited, as, the, father, of, analytical, geometry, the, bridge, between, algebra, and, geometry, important, to, the, discovery, of, calculus, and, analysis, the, dutch, physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and, inventor, christiaan, huygens, 1629, 1695, was, the, leading, scientist, in, europe, between, galileo, and, newton, huygens, came, from, a, family, of, nobility, that, had, an, important, position, in, the, dutch, society, of, the, 17th, century, a, time, in, which, the, dutch, republic, flourished, economically, and, culturally, this, period, roughly, between, 1588, and, 1702, of, the, history, of, the, netherlands, is, also, referred, to, as, the, dutch, golden, age, an, era, during, the, scientific, revolution, when, dutch, science, was, among, the, most, acclaimed, in, europe, at, this, time, intellectuals, and, scientists, like, ren, descartes, baruch, spinoza, pierre, bayle, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, john, locke, and, hugo, grotius, resided, in, the, netherlands, it, was, in, this, intellectual, environment, where, christiaan, huygens, grew, up, christiaan, s, father, constantijn, huygens, was, apart, from, an, important, poet, the, secretary, and, diplomat, for, the, princes, of, orange, he, knew, many, scientists, of, his, time, because, of, his, contacts, and, intellectual, interests, including, ren, descartes, and, marin, mersenne, and, it, was, because, of, these, contacts, that, christiaan, huygens, became, aware, of, their, work, especially, descartes, whose, mechanistic, philosophy, was, going, to, have, a, huge, influence, on, huygens, own, work, descartes, was, later, impressed, by, the, skills, christiaan, huygens, showed, in, geometry, as, was, mersenne, who, christened, him, the, new, archimedes, which, led, constantijn, to, refer, to, his, son, as, my, little, archimedes, a, child, prodigy, huygens, began, his, correspondence, with, marin, mersenne, when, he, was, 17, years, old, huygens, became, interested, in, games, of, chance, when, he, encountered, the, work, of, fermat, blaise, pascal, and, girard, desargues, it, was, blaise, pascal, who, encourages, him, to, write, van, rekeningh, in, spelen, van, gluck, which, frans, van, schooten, translated, and, published, as, de, ratiociniis, in, ludo, aleae, in, 1657, the, book, is, the, earliest, known, scientific, treatment, of, the, subject, and, at, the, time, the, most, coherent, presentation, of, a, mathematical, approach, to, games, of, chance, two, years, later, huygens, derived, geometrically, the, now, standard, formulae, in, classical, mechanics, for, the, centripetal, and, centrifugal, force, in, his, work, de, vi, centrifuga, 1659, around, the, same, time, huygens, research, in, horology, resulted, in, the, invention, of, the, pendulum, clock, a, breakthrough, in, timekeeping, and, the, most, accurate, timekeeper, for, almost, 300, years, the, theoretical, research, of, the, way, the, pendulum, works, eventually, led, to, the, publication, of, one, of, his, most, important, achievements, the, horologium, oscillatorium, this, work, was, published, in, 1673, and, became, one, of, the, three, most, important, 17th, century, works, on, mechanics, the, other, two, being, galileo, s, discourses, and, mathematical, demonstrations, relating, to, two, new, sciences, 1638, and, newton, s, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, 1687, the, horologium, oscillatorium, is, the, first, modern, treatise, in, which, a, physical, problem, the, accelerated, motion, of, a, falling, body, is, idealized, by, a, set, of, parameters, then, analyzed, mathematically, and, constitutes, one, of, the, seminal, works, of, applied, mathematics, it, is, for, this, reason, huygens, has, been, called, the, first, theoretical, physicist, and, one, of, the, founders, of, modern, mathematical, physics, huygens, horologium, oscillatorium, had, a, tremendous, influence, on, the, history, of, physics, especially, on, the, work, of, isaac, newton, who, greatly, admired, the, work, for, instance, the, laws, huygens, described, in, the, horologium, oscillatorium, are, structurally, the, same, as, newton, s, first, two, laws, of, motion, five, years, after, the, publication, of, his, horologium, oscillatorium, huygens, described, his, wave, theory, of, light, though, proposed, in, 1678, it, was, not, published, until, 1690, in, his, trait, de, la, lumi, re, his, mathematical, theory, of, light, was, initially, rejected, in, favour, of, newton, s, corpuscular, theory, of, light, until, augustin, jean, fresnel, adopted, huygens, principle, to, give, a, complete, explanation, of, the, rectilinear, propagation, and, diffraction, effects, of, light, in, 1821, today, this, principle, is, known, as, the, huygens, fresnel, principle, as, an, astronomer, huygens, began, grinding, lenses, with, his, brother, constantijn, jr, to, build, telescopes, for, astronomical, research, he, was, the, first, to, identify, the, rings, of, saturn, as, a, thin, flat, ring, nowhere, touching, and, inclined, to, the, ecliptic, and, discovered, the, first, of, saturn, s, moons, titan, using, a, refracting, telescope, apart, from, the, many, important, discoveries, huygens, made, in, physics, and, astronomy, and, his, inventions, of, ingenious, devices, he, was, also, the, first, who, brought, mathematical, rigor, to, the, description, of, physical, phenomena, because, of, this, and, the, fact, that, he, developed, institutional, frameworks, for, scientific, research, on, the, continent, he, has, been, referred, to, as, the, leading, actor, in, the, making, of, science, in, europe, the, late, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, saw, the, achievements, of, cambridge, university, physicist, and, mathematician, sir, isaac, newton, 1642, 1727, newton, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, of, england, combined, his, own, discoveries, in, mechanics, and, astronomy, to, earlier, ones, to, create, a, single, system, for, describing, the, workings, of, the, universe, newton, formulated, three, laws, of, motion, which, formulated, the, relationship, between, motion, and, objects, and, also, the, law, of, universal, gravitation, the, latter, of, which, could, be, used, to, explain, the, behavior, not, only, of, falling, bodies, on, the, earth, but, also, planets, and, other, celestial, bodies, to, arrive, at, his, results, newton, invented, one, form, of, an, entirely, new, branch, of, mathematics, calculus, also, invented, independently, by, gottfried, leibniz, which, was, to, become, an, essential, tool, in, much, of, the, later, development, in, most, branches, of, physics, newton, s, findings, were, set, forth, in, his, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, mathematical, principles, of, natural, philosophy, the, publication, of, which, in, 1687, marked, the, beginning, of, the, modern, period, of, mechanics, and, astronomy, newton, was, able, to, refute, the, cartesian, mechanical, tradition, that, all, motions, should, be, explained, with, respect, to, the, immediate, force, exerted, by, corpuscles, using, his, three, laws, of, motion, and, law, of, universal, gravitation, newton, removed, the, idea, that, objects, followed, paths, determined, by, natural, shapes, and, instead, demonstrated, that, not, only, regularly, observed, paths, but, all, the, future, motions, of, any, body, could, be, deduced, mathematically, based, on, knowledge, of, their, existing, motion, their, mass, and, the, forces, acting, upon, them, however, observed, celestial, motions, did, not, precisely, conform, to, a, newtonian, treatment, and, newton, who, was, also, deeply, interested, in, theology, imagined, that, god, intervened, to, ensure, the, continued, stability, of, the, solar, system, newton, s, principles, but, not, his, mathematical, treatments, proved, controversial, with, continental, philosophers, who, found, his, lack, of, metaphysical, explanation, for, movement, and, gravitation, philosophically, unacceptable, beginning, around, 1700, a, bitter, rift, opened, between, the, continental, and, british, philosophical, traditions, which, were, stoked, by, heated, ongoing, and, viciously, personal, disputes, between, the, followers, of, newton, and, leibniz, concerning, priority, over, the, analytical, techniques, of, calculus, which, each, had, developed, independently, initially, the, cartesian, and, leibnizian, traditions, prevailed, on, the, continent, leading, to, the, dominance, of, the, leibnizian, calculus, notation, everywhere, except, britain, newton, himself, remained, privately, disturbed, at, the, lack, of, a, philosophical, understanding, of, gravitation, while, insisting, in, his, writings, that, none, was, necessary, to, infer, its, reality, as, the, 18th, century, progressed, continental, natural, philosophers, increasingly, accepted, the, newtonians, willingness, to, forgo, ontological, metaphysical, explanations, for, mathematically, described, motions, newton, built, the, first, functioning, reflecting, telescope, and, developed, a, theory, of, color, published, in, opticks, based, on, the, observation, that, a, prism, decomposes, white, light, into, the, many, colours, forming, the, visible, spectrum, while, newton, explained, light, as, being, composed, of, tiny, particles, a, rival, theory, of, light, which, explained, its, behavior, in, terms, of, waves, was, presented, in, 1690, by, christiaan, huygens, however, the, belief, in, the, mechanistic, philosophy, coupled, with, newton, s, reputation, meant, that, the, wave, theory, saw, relatively, little, support, until, the, 19th, century, newton, also, formulated, an, empirical, law, of, cooling, studied, the, speed, of, sound, investigated, power, series, demonstrated, the, generalised, binomial, theorem, and, developed, a, method, for, approximating, the, roots, of, a, function, his, work, on, infinite, series, was, inspired, by, simon, stevin, s, decimals, most, importantly, newton, showed, that, the, motions, of, objects, on, earth, and, of, celestial, bodies, are, governed, by, the, same, set, of, natural, laws, which, were, neither, capricious, nor, malevolent, by, demonstrating, the, consistency, between, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, and, his, own, theory, of, gravitation, newton, also, removed, the, last, doubts, about, heliocentrism, by, bringing, together, all, the, ideas, set, forth, during, the, scientific, revolution, newton, effectively, established, the, foundation, for, modern, society, in, mathematics, and, science, other, branches, of, physics, also, received, attention, during, the, period, of, the, scientific, revolution, william, gilbert, court, physician, to, queen, elizabeth, i, published, an, important, work, on, magnetism, in, 1600, describing, how, the, earth, itself, behaves, like, a, giant, magnet, robert, boyle, 1627, 1691, studied, the, behavior, of, gases, enclosed, in, a, chamber, and, formulated, the, gas, law, named, for, him, he, also, contributed, to, physiology, and, to, the, founding, of, modern, chemistry, another, important, factor, in, the, scientific, revolution, was, the, rise, of, learned, societies, and, academies, in, various, countries, the, earliest, of, these, were, in, italy, and, germany, and, were, short, lived, more, influential, were, the, royal, society, of, england, 1660, and, the, academy, of, sciences, in, france, 1666, the, former, was, a, private, institution, in, london, and, included, such, scientists, as, john, wallis, william, brouncker, thomas, sydenham, john, mayow, and, christopher, wren, who, contributed, not, only, to, architecture, but, also, to, astronomy, and, anatomy, the, latter, in, paris, was, a, government, institution, and, included, as, a, foreign, member, the, dutchman, huygens, in, the, 18th, century, important, royal, academies, were, established, at, berlin, 1700, and, at, st, petersburg, 1724, the, societies, and, academies, provided, the, principal, opportunities, for, the, publication, and, discussion, of, scientific, results, during, and, after, the, scientific, revolution, in, 1690, james, bernoulli, showed, that, the, cycloid, is, the, solution, to, the, tautochrone, problem, and, the, following, year, in, 1691, johann, bernoulli, showed, that, a, chain, freely, suspended, from, two, points, will, form, a, catenary, the, curve, with, the, lowest, possible, center, of, gravity, available, to, any, chain, hung, between, two, fixed, points, he, then, showed, in, 1696, that, the, cycloid, is, the, solution, to, the, brachistochrone, problem, a, precursor, of, the, engine, was, designed, by, the, german, scientist, otto, von, guericke, who, in, 1650, designed, and, built, the, world, s, first, vacuum, pump, to, create, a, vacuum, as, demonstrated, in, the, magdeburg, hemispheres, experiment, he, was, driven, to, make, a, vacuum, to, disprove, aristotle, s, long, held, supposition, that, nature, abhors, a, vacuum, shortly, thereafter, irish, physicist, and, chemist, boyle, had, learned, of, guericke, s, designs, and, in, 1656, in, coordination, with, english, scientist, robert, hooke, built, an, air, pump, using, this, pump, boyle, and, hooke, noticed, the, pressure, volume, correlation, for, a, gas, pv, k, where, p, is, pressure, v, is, volume, and, k, is, a, constant, this, relationship, is, known, as, boyle, s, law, in, that, time, air, was, assumed, to, be, a, system, of, motionless, particles, and, not, interpreted, as, a, system, of, moving, molecules, the, concept, of, thermal, motion, came, two, centuries, later, therefore, boyle, s, publication, in, 1660, speaks, about, a, mechanical, concept, the, air, spring, later, after, the, invention, of, the, thermometer, the, property, temperature, could, be, quantified, this, tool, gave, gay, lussac, the, opportunity, to, derive, his, law, which, led, shortly, later, to, the, ideal, gas, law, but, already, before, the, establishment, of, the, ideal, gas, law, an, associate, of, boyle, s, named, denis, papin, built, in, 1679, a, bone, digester, which, is, a, closed, vessel, with, a, tightly, fitting, lid, that, confines, steam, until, a, high, pressure, is, generated, later, designs, implemented, a, steam, release, valve, to, keep, the, machine, from, exploding, by, watching, the, valve, rhythmically, move, up, and, down, papin, conceived, of, the, idea, of, a, piston, and, cylinder, engine, he, did, not, however, follow, through, with, his, design, nevertheless, in, 1697, based, on, papin, s, designs, engineer, thomas, savery, built, the, first, engine, although, these, early, engines, were, crude, and, inefficient, they, attracted, the, attention, of, the, leading, scientists, of, the, time, hence, prior, to, 1698, and, the, invention, of, the, savery, engine, horses, were, used, to, power, pulleys, attached, to, buckets, which, lifted, water, out, of, flooded, salt, mines, in, england, in, the, years, to, follow, more, variations, of, steam, engines, were, built, such, as, the, newcomen, engine, and, later, the, watt, engine, in, time, these, early, engines, would, eventually, be, used, in, place, of, horses, thus, each, engine, began, to, be, associated, with, a, certain, amount, of, horse, power, depending, upon, how, many, horses, it, had, replaced, the, main, problem, with, these, first, engines, was, that, they, were, slow, and, clumsy, converting, less, than, 2, of, the, input, fuel, into, useful, work, in, other, words, large, quantities, of, coal, or, wood, had, to, be, burned, to, yield, only, a, small, fraction, of, work, output, hence, the, need, for, a, new, science, of, engine, dynamics, was, born, during, the, 18th, century, the, mechanics, founded, by, newton, was, developed, by, several, scientists, as, more, mathematicians, learned, calculus, and, elaborated, upon, its, initial, formulation, the, application, of, mathematical, analysis, to, problems, of, motion, was, known, as, rational, mechanics, or, mixed, mathematics, and, was, later, termed, classical, mechanics, in, 1714, brook, taylor, derived, the, fundamental, frequency, of, a, stretched, vibrating, string, in, terms, of, its, tension, and, mass, per, unit, length, by, solving, a, differential, equation, the, swiss, mathematician, daniel, bernoulli, 1700, 1782, made, important, mathematical, studies, of, the, behavior, of, gases, anticipating, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, developed, more, than, a, century, later, and, has, been, referred, to, as, the, first, mathematical, physicist, in, 1733, daniel, bernoulli, derived, the, fundamental, frequency, and, harmonics, of, a, hanging, chain, by, solving, a, differential, equation, in, 1734, bernoulli, solved, the, differential, equation, for, the, vibrations, of, an, elastic, bar, clamped, at, one, end, bernoulli, s, treatment, of, fluid, dynamics, and, his, examination, of, fluid, flow, was, introduced, in, his, 1738, work, hydrodynamica, rational, mechanics, dealt, primarily, with, the, development, of, elaborate, mathematical, treatments, of, observed, motions, using, newtonian, principles, as, a, basis, and, emphasized, improving, the, tractability, of, complex, calculations, and, developing, of, legitimate, means, of, analytical, approximation, a, representative, contemporary, textbook, was, published, by, johann, baptiste, horvath, by, the, end, of, the, century, analytical, treatments, were, rigorous, enough, to, verify, the, stability, of, the, solar, system, solely, on, the, basis, of, newton, s, laws, without, reference, to, divine, intervention, even, as, deterministic, treatments, of, systems, as, simple, as, the, three, body, problem, in, gravitation, remained, intractable, in, 1705, edmond, halley, predicted, the, periodicity, of, halley, s, comet, william, herschel, discovered, uranus, in, 1781, and, henry, cavendish, measured, the, gravitational, constant, and, determined, the, mass, of, the, earth, in, 1798, in, 1783, john, michell, suggested, that, some, objects, might, be, so, massive, that, not, even, light, could, escape, from, them, in, 1739, leonhard, euler, solved, the, ordinary, differential, equation, for, a, forced, harmonic, oscillator, and, noticed, the, resonance, phenomenon, in, 1742, colin, maclaurin, discovered, his, uniformly, rotating, self, gravitating, spheroids, in, 1742, benjamin, robins, published, his, new, principles, in, gunnery, establishing, the, science, of, aerodynamics, british, work, carried, on, by, mathematicians, such, as, taylor, and, maclaurin, fell, behind, continental, developments, as, the, century, progressed, meanwhile, work, flourished, at, scientific, academies, on, the, continent, led, by, such, mathematicians, as, bernoulli, and, euler, as, well, as, joseph, louis, lagrange, pierre, simon, laplace, and, adrien, marie, legendre, in, 1743, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, published, his, trait, de, dynamique, in, which, he, introduced, the, concept, of, generalized, forces, for, accelerating, systems, and, systems, with, constraints, and, applied, the, new, idea, of, virtual, work, to, solve, dynamical, problem, now, known, as, d, alembert, s, principle, as, a, rival, to, newton, s, second, law, of, motion, in, 1747, pierre, louis, maupertuis, applied, minimum, principles, to, mechanics, in, 1759, euler, solved, the, partial, differential, equation, for, the, vibration, of, a, rectangular, drum, in, 1764, euler, examined, the, partial, differential, equation, for, the, vibration, of, a, circular, drum, and, found, one, of, the, bessel, function, solutions, in, 1776, john, smeaton, published, a, paper, on, experiments, relating, power, work, momentum, and, kinetic, energy, and, supporting, the, conservation, of, energy, in, 1788, lagrange, presented, his, equations, of, motion, in, m, canique, analytique, in, which, the, whole, of, mechanics, was, organized, around, the, principle, of, virtual, work, in, 1789, antoine, lavoisier, stated, the, law, of, conservation, of, mass, the, rational, mechanics, developed, in, the, 18th, century, received, expositions, in, both, lagrange, s, m, canique, analytique, and, laplace, s, trait, de, m, canique, c, leste, 1799, 1825, during, the, 18th, century, thermodynamics, was, developed, through, the, theories, of, weightless, imponderable, fluids, such, as, heat, caloric, electricity, and, phlogiston, which, was, rapidly, overthrown, as, a, concept, following, lavoisier, s, identification, of, oxygen, gas, late, in, the, century, assuming, that, these, concepts, were, real, fluids, their, flow, could, be, traced, through, a, mechanical, apparatus, or, chemical, reactions, this, tradition, of, experimentation, led, to, the, development, of, new, kinds, of, experimental, apparatus, such, as, the, leyden, jar, and, new, kinds, of, measuring, instruments, such, as, the, calorimeter, and, improved, versions, of, old, ones, such, as, the, thermometer, experiments, also, produced, new, concepts, such, as, the, university, of, glasgow, experimenter, joseph, black, s, notion, of, latent, heat, and, philadelphia, intellectual, benjamin, franklin, s, characterization, of, electrical, fluid, as, flowing, between, places, of, excess, and, deficit, a, concept, later, reinterpreted, in, terms, of, positive, and, negative, charges, franklin, also, showed, that, lightning, is, electricity, in, 1752, the, accepted, theory, of, heat, in, the, 18th, century, viewed, it, as, a, kind, of, fluid, called, caloric, although, this, theory, was, later, shown, to, be, erroneous, a, number, of, scientists, adhering, to, it, nevertheless, made, important, discoveries, useful, in, developing, the, modern, theory, including, joseph, black, 1728, 1799, and, henry, cavendish, 1731, 1810, opposed, to, this, caloric, theory, which, had, been, developed, mainly, by, the, chemists, was, the, less, accepted, theory, dating, from, newton, s, time, that, heat, is, due, to, the, motions, of, the, particles, of, a, substance, this, mechanical, theory, gained, support, in, 1798, from, the, cannon, boring, experiments, of, count, rumford, benjamin, thompson, who, found, a, direct, relationship, between, heat, and, mechanical, energy, while, it, was, recognized, early, in, the, 18th, century, that, finding, absolute, theories, of, electrostatic, and, magnetic, force, akin, to, newton, s, principles, of, motion, would, be, an, important, achievement, none, were, forthcoming, this, impossibility, only, slowly, disappeared, as, experimental, practice, became, more, widespread, and, more, refined, in, the, early, years, of, the, 19th, century, in, places, such, as, the, newly, established, royal, institution, in, london, meanwhile, the, analytical, methods, of, rational, mechanics, began, to, be, applied, to, experimental, phenomena, most, influentially, with, the, french, mathematician, joseph, fourier, s, analytical, treatment, of, the, flow, of, heat, as, published, in, 1822, joseph, priestley, proposed, an, electrical, inverse, square, law, in, 1767, and, charles, augustin, de, coulomb, introduced, the, inverse, square, law, of, electrostatics, in, 1798, at, the, end, of, the, century, the, members, of, the, french, academy, of, sciences, had, attained, clear, dominance, in, the, field, at, the, same, time, the, experimental, tradition, established, by, galileo, and, his, followers, persisted, the, royal, society, and, the, french, academy, of, sciences, were, major, centers, for, the, performance, and, reporting, of, experimental, work, experiments, in, mechanics, optics, magnetism, static, electricity, chemistry, and, physiology, were, not, clearly, distinguished, from, each, other, during, the, 18th, century, but, significant, differences, in, explanatory, schemes, and, thus, experiment, design, were, emerging, chemical, experimenters, for, instance, defied, attempts, to, enforce, a, scheme, of, abstract, newtonian, forces, onto, chemical, affiliations, and, instead, focused, on, the, isolation, and, classification, of, chemical, substances, and, reactions, in, 1821, william, hamilton, began, his, analysis, of, hamilton, s, characteristic, function, in, 1835, he, stated, hamilton, s, canonical, equations, of, motion, in, 1813, peter, ewart, supported, the, idea, of, the, conservation, of, energy, in, his, paper, on, the, measure, of, moving, force, in, 1829, gaspard, coriolis, introduced, the, terms, of, work, force, times, distance, and, kinetic, energy, with, the, meanings, they, have, today, in, 1841, julius, robert, von, mayer, an, amateur, scientist, wrote, a, paper, on, the, conservation, of, energy, although, his, lack, of, academic, training, led, to, its, rejection, in, 1847, hermann, von, helmholtz, formally, stated, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, in, 1800, alessandro, volta, invented, the, electric, battery, known, as, the, voltaic, pile, and, thus, improved, the, way, electric, currents, could, also, be, studied, a, year, later, thomas, young, demonstrated, the, wave, nature, of, light, which, received, strong, experimental, support, from, the, work, of, augustin, jean, fresnel, and, the, principle, of, interference, in, 1820, hans, christian, rsted, found, that, a, current, carrying, conductor, gives, rise, to, a, magnetic, force, surrounding, it, and, within, a, week, after, rsted, s, discovery, reached, france, andr, marie, amp, re, discovered, that, two, parallel, electric, currents, will, exert, forces, on, each, other, in, 1821, michael, faraday, built, an, electricity, powered, motor, while, georg, ohm, stated, his, law, of, electrical, resistance, in, 1826, expressing, the, relationship, between, voltage, current, and, resistance, in, an, electric, circuit, in, 1831, faraday, and, independently, joseph, henry, discovered, the, reverse, effect, the, production, of, an, electric, potential, or, current, through, magnetism, known, as, electromagnetic, induction, these, two, discoveries, are, the, basis, of, the, electric, motor, and, the, electric, generator, respectively, in, the, 19th, century, the, connection, between, heat, and, mechanical, energy, was, established, quantitatively, by, julius, robert, von, mayer, and, james, prescott, joule, who, measured, the, mechanical, equivalent, of, heat, in, the, 1840s, in, 1849, joule, published, results, from, his, series, of, experiments, including, the, paddlewheel, experiment, which, show, that, heat, is, a, form, of, energy, a, fact, that, was, accepted, in, the, 1850s, the, relation, between, heat, and, energy, was, important, for, the, development, of, steam, engines, and, in, 1824, the, experimental, and, theoretical, work, of, sadi, carnot, was, published, carnot, captured, some, of, the, ideas, of, thermodynamics, in, his, discussion, of, the, efficiency, of, an, idealized, engine, sadi, carnot, s, work, provided, a, basis, for, the, formulation, of, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, a, restatement, of, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, which, was, stated, around, 1850, by, william, thomson, later, known, as, lord, kelvin, and, rudolf, clausius, lord, kelvin, who, had, extended, the, concept, of, absolute, zero, from, gases, to, all, substances, in, 1848, drew, upon, the, engineering, theory, of, lazare, carnot, sadi, carnot, and, mile, clapeyron, as, well, as, the, experimentation, of, james, prescott, joule, on, the, interchangeability, of, mechanical, chemical, thermal, and, electrical, forms, of, work, to, formulate, the, first, law, kelvin, and, clausius, also, stated, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, which, was, originally, formulated, in, terms, of, the, fact, that, heat, does, not, spontaneously, flow, from, a, colder, body, to, a, hotter, other, formulations, followed, quickly, for, example, the, second, law, was, expounded, in, thomson, and, peter, guthrie, tait, s, influential, work, treatise, on, natural, philosophy, and, kelvin, in, particular, understood, some, of, the, law, s, general, implications, the, second, law, the, idea, that, gases, consist, of, molecules, in, motion, had, been, discussed, in, some, detail, by, daniel, bernoulli, in, 1738, but, had, fallen, out, of, favor, and, was, revived, by, clausius, in, 1857, in, 1850, hippolyte, fizeau, and, l, on, foucault, measured, the, speed, of, light, in, water, and, find, that, it, is, slower, than, in, air, in, support, of, the, wave, model, of, light, in, 1852, joule, and, thomson, demonstrated, that, a, rapidly, expanding, gas, cools, later, named, the, joule, thomson, effect, or, joule, kelvin, effect, hermann, von, helmholtz, puts, forward, the, idea, of, the, heat, death, of, the, universe, in, 1854, the, same, year, that, clausius, established, the, importance, of, dq, t, clausius, s, theorem, though, he, did, not, yet, name, the, quantity, in, 1859, james, clerk, maxwell, discovered, the, distribution, law, of, molecular, velocities, maxwell, showed, that, electric, and, magnetic, fields, are, propagated, outward, from, their, source, at, a, speed, equal, to, that, of, light, and, that, light, is, one, of, several, kinds, of, electromagnetic, radiation, differing, only, in, frequency, and, wavelength, from, the, others, in, 1859, maxwell, worked, out, the, mathematics, of, the, distribution, of, velocities, of, the, molecules, of, a, gas, the, wave, theory, of, light, was, widely, accepted, by, the, time, of, maxwell, s, work, on, the, electromagnetic, field, and, afterward, the, study, of, light, and, that, of, electricity, and, magnetism, were, closely, related, in, 1864, james, maxwell, published, his, papers, on, a, dynamical, theory, of, the, electromagnetic, field, and, stated, that, light, is, an, electromagnetic, phenomenon, in, the, 1873, publication, of, maxwell, s, treatise, on, electricity, and, magnetism, this, work, drew, upon, theoretical, work, by, german, theoreticians, such, as, carl, friedrich, gauss, and, wilhelm, weber, the, encapsulation, of, heat, in, particulate, motion, and, the, addition, of, electromagnetic, forces, to, newtonian, dynamics, established, an, enormously, robust, theoretical, underpinning, to, physical, observations, the, prediction, that, light, represented, a, transmission, of, energy, in, wave, form, through, a, luminiferous, ether, and, the, seeming, confirmation, of, that, prediction, with, helmholtz, student, heinrich, hertz, s, 1888, detection, of, electromagnetic, radiation, was, a, major, triumph, for, physical, theory, and, raised, the, possibility, that, even, more, fundamental, theories, based, on, the, field, could, soon, be, developed, experimental, confirmation, of, maxwell, s, theory, was, provided, by, hertz, who, generated, and, detected, electric, waves, in, 1886, and, verified, their, properties, at, the, same, time, foreshadowing, their, application, in, radio, television, and, other, devices, in, 1887, heinrich, hertz, discovered, the, photoelectric, effect, research, on, the, electromagnetic, waves, began, soon, after, with, many, scientists, and, inventors, conducting, experiments, on, their, properties, in, the, mid, to, late, 1890s, guglielmo, marconi, developed, a, radio, wave, based, wireless, telegraphy, system, see, invention, of, radio, the, atomic, theory, of, matter, had, been, proposed, again, in, the, early, 19th, century, by, the, chemist, john, dalton, and, became, one, of, the, hypotheses, of, the, kinetic, molecular, theory, of, gases, developed, by, clausius, and, james, clerk, maxwell, to, explain, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, the, kinetic, theory, in, turn, led, to, a, revolutionary, approach, to, science, the, statistical, mechanics, of, ludwig, boltzmann, 1844, 1906, and, josiah, willard, gibbs, 1839, 1903, which, studies, the, statistics, of, microstates, of, a, system, and, uses, statistics, to, determine, the, state, of, a, physical, system, interrelating, the, statistical, likelihood, of, certain, states, of, organization, of, these, particles, with, the, energy, of, those, states, clausius, reinterpreted, the, dissipation, of, energy, to, be, the, statistical, tendency, of, molecular, configurations, to, pass, toward, increasingly, likely, increasingly, disorganized, states, coining, the, term, entropy, to, describe, the, disorganization, of, a, state, the, statistical, versus, absolute, interpretations, of, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, set, up, a, dispute, that, would, last, for, several, decades, producing, arguments, such, as, maxwell, s, demon, and, that, would, not, be, held, to, be, definitively, resolved, until, the, behavior, of, atoms, was, firmly, established, in, the, early, 20th, century, in, 1902, james, jeans, found, the, length, scale, required, for, gravitational, perturbations, to, grow, in, a, static, nearly, homogeneous, medium, in, 1822, botanist, robert, brown, discovered, brownian, motion, pollen, grains, in, water, undergoing, movement, resulting, from, their, bombardment, by, the, fast, moving, atoms, or, molecules, in, the, liquid, in, 1834, carl, jacobi, discovered, his, uniformly, rotating, self, gravitating, ellipsoids, the, jacobi, ellipsoid, in, 1834, john, russell, observed, a, nondecaying, solitary, water, wave, soliton, in, the, union, canal, near, edinburgh, and, used, a, water, tank, to, study, the, dependence, of, solitary, water, wave, velocities, on, wave, amplitude, and, water, depth, in, 1835, gaspard, coriolis, examined, theoretically, the, mechanical, efficiency, of, waterwheels, and, deduced, the, coriolis, effect, in, 1842, christian, doppler, proposed, the, doppler, effect, in, 1851, l, on, foucault, showed, the, earth, s, rotation, with, a, huge, pendulum, foucault, pendulum, there, were, important, advances, in, continuum, mechanics, in, the, first, half, of, the, century, namely, formulation, of, laws, of, elasticity, for, solids, and, discovery, of, navier, stokes, equations, for, fluids, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, physics, had, evolved, to, the, point, at, which, classical, mechanics, could, cope, with, highly, complex, problems, involving, macroscopic, situations, thermodynamics, and, kinetic, theory, were, well, established, geometrical, and, physical, optics, could, be, understood, in, terms, of, electromagnetic, waves, and, the, conservation, laws, for, energy, and, momentum, and, mass, were, widely, accepted, so, profound, were, these, and, other, developments, that, it, was, generally, accepted, that, all, the, important, laws, of, physics, had, been, discovered, and, that, henceforth, research, would, be, concerned, with, clearing, up, minor, problems, and, particularly, with, improvements, of, method, and, measurement, however, around, 1900, serious, doubts, arose, about, the, completeness, of, the, classical, theories, the, triumph, of, maxwell, s, theories, for, example, was, undermined, by, inadequacies, that, had, already, begun, to, appear, and, their, inability, to, explain, certain, physical, phenomena, such, as, the, energy, distribution, in, blackbody, radiation, and, the, photoelectric, effect, while, some, of, the, theoretical, formulations, led, to, paradoxes, when, pushed, to, the, limit, prominent, physicists, such, as, hendrik, lorentz, emil, cohn, ernst, wiechert, and, wilhelm, wien, believed, that, some, modification, of, maxwell, s, equations, might, provide, the, basis, for, all, physical, laws, these, shortcomings, of, classical, physics, were, never, to, be, resolved, and, new, ideas, were, required, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, a, major, revolution, shook, the, world, of, physics, which, led, to, a, new, era, generally, referred, to, as, modern, physics, in, the, 19th, century, experimenters, began, to, detect, unexpected, forms, of, radiation, wilhelm, r, ntgen, caused, a, sensation, with, his, discovery, of, x, rays, in, 1895, in, 1896, henri, becquerel, discovered, that, certain, kinds, of, matter, emit, radiation, on, their, own, accord, in, 1897, j, j, thomson, discovered, the, electron, and, new, radioactive, elements, found, by, marie, and, pierre, curie, raised, questions, about, the, supposedly, indestructible, atom, and, the, nature, of, matter, marie, and, pierre, coined, the, term, radioactivity, to, describe, this, property, of, matter, and, isolated, the, radioactive, elements, radium, and, polonium, ernest, rutherford, and, frederick, soddy, identified, two, of, becquerel, s, forms, of, radiation, with, electrons, and, the, element, helium, rutherford, identified, and, named, two, types, of, radioactivity, and, in, 1911, interpreted, experimental, evidence, as, showing, that, the, atom, consists, of, a, dense, positively, charged, nucleus, surrounded, by, negatively, charged, electrons, classical, theory, however, predicted, that, this, structure, should, be, unstable, classical, theory, had, also, failed, to, explain, successfully, two, other, experimental, results, that, appeared, in, the, late, 19th, century, one, of, these, was, the, demonstration, by, albert, a, michelson, and, edward, w, morley, known, as, the, michelson, morley, experiment, which, showed, there, did, not, seem, to, be, a, preferred, frame, of, reference, at, rest, with, respect, to, the, hypothetical, luminiferous, ether, for, describing, electromagnetic, phenomena, studies, of, radiation, and, radioactive, decay, continued, to, be, a, preeminent, focus, for, physical, and, chemical, research, through, the, 1930s, when, the, discovery, of, nuclear, fission, by, lise, meitner, and, otto, frisch, opened, the, way, to, the, practical, exploitation, of, what, came, to, be, called, atomic, energy, in, 1905, a, 26, year, old, german, physicist, named, albert, einstein, then, a, patent, clerk, in, bern, switzerland, showed, how, measurements, of, time, and, space, are, affected, by, motion, between, an, observer, and, what, is, being, observed, einstein, s, radical, theory, of, relativity, revolutionized, science, although, einstein, made, many, other, important, contributions, to, science, the, theory, of, relativity, alone, represents, one, of, the, greatest, intellectual, achievements, of, all, time, although, the, concept, of, relativity, was, not, introduced, by, einstein, he, recognised, that, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, is, constant, i, e, the, same, for, all, observers, and, an, absolute, upper, limit, to, speed, this, does, not, impact, a, person, s, day, to, day, life, since, most, objects, travel, at, speeds, much, slower, than, light, speed, for, objects, travelling, near, light, speed, however, the, theory, of, relativity, shows, that, clocks, associated, with, those, objects, will, run, more, slowly, and, that, the, objects, shorten, in, length, according, to, measurements, of, an, observer, on, earth, einstein, also, derived, the, equation, e, mc, 2, which, expresses, the, equivalence, of, mass, and, energy, einstein, argued, that, the, speed, of, light, was, a, constant, in, all, inertial, reference, frames, and, that, electromagnetic, laws, should, remain, valid, independent, of, reference, frame, assertions, which, rendered, the, ether, superfluous, to, physical, theory, and, that, held, that, observations, of, time, and, length, varied, relative, to, how, the, observer, was, moving, with, respect, to, the, object, being, measured, what, came, to, be, called, the, special, theory, of, relativity, it, also, followed, that, mass, and, energy, were, interchangeable, quantities, according, to, the, equation, e, mc, 2, in, another, paper, published, the, same, year, einstein, asserted, that, electromagnetic, radiation, was, transmitted, in, discrete, quantities, quanta, according, to, a, constant, that, the, theoretical, physicist, max, planck, had, posited, in, 1900, to, arrive, at, an, accurate, theory, for, the, distribution, of, blackbody, radiation, an, assumption, that, explained, the, strange, properties, of, the, photoelectric, effect, the, special, theory, of, relativity, is, a, formulation, of, the, relationship, between, physical, observations, and, the, concepts, of, space, and, time, the, theory, arose, out, of, contradictions, between, electromagnetism, and, newtonian, mechanics, and, had, great, impact, on, both, those, areas, the, original, historical, issue, was, whether, it, was, meaningful, to, discuss, the, electromagnetic, wave, carrying, ether, and, motion, relative, to, it, and, also, whether, one, could, detect, such, motion, as, was, unsuccessfully, attempted, in, the, michelson, morley, experiment, einstein, demolished, these, questions, and, the, ether, concept, in, his, special, theory, of, relativity, however, his, basic, formulation, does, not, involve, detailed, electromagnetic, theory, it, arises, out, of, the, question, what, is, time, newton, in, the, principia, 1686, had, given, an, unambiguous, answer, absolute, true, and, mathematical, time, of, itself, and, from, its, own, nature, flows, equably, without, relation, to, anything, external, and, by, another, name, is, called, duration, this, definition, is, basic, to, all, classical, physics, einstein, had, the, genius, to, question, it, and, found, that, it, was, incomplete, instead, each, observer, necessarily, makes, use, of, his, or, her, own, scale, of, time, and, for, two, observers, in, relative, motion, their, time, scales, will, differ, this, induces, a, related, effect, on, position, measurements, space, and, time, become, intertwined, concepts, fundamentally, dependent, on, the, observer, each, observer, presides, over, his, or, her, own, space, time, framework, or, coordinate, system, there, being, no, absolute, frame, of, reference, all, observers, of, given, events, make, different, but, equally, valid, and, reconcilable, measurements, what, remains, absolute, is, stated, in, einstein, s, relativity, postulate, the, basic, laws, of, physics, are, identical, for, two, observers, who, have, a, constant, relative, velocity, with, respect, to, each, other, special, relativity, had, a, profound, effect, on, physics, started, as, a, rethinking, of, the, theory, of, electromagnetism, it, found, a, new, symmetry, law, of, nature, now, called, poincar, symmetry, that, replaced, the, old, galilean, symmetry, special, relativity, exerted, another, long, lasting, effect, on, dynamics, although, initially, it, was, credited, with, the, unification, of, mass, and, energy, it, became, evident, that, relativistic, dynamics, established, a, firm, distinction, between, rest, mass, which, is, an, invariant, observer, independent, property, of, a, particle, or, system, of, particles, and, the, energy, and, momentum, of, a, system, the, latter, two, are, separately, conserved, in, all, situations, but, not, invariant, with, respect, to, different, observers, the, term, mass, in, particle, physics, underwent, a, semantic, change, and, since, the, late, 20th, century, it, almost, exclusively, denotes, the, rest, or, invariant, mass, by, 1916, einstein, was, able, to, generalize, this, further, to, deal, with, all, states, of, motion, including, non, uniform, acceleration, which, became, the, general, theory, of, relativity, in, this, theory, einstein, also, specified, a, new, concept, the, curvature, of, space, time, which, described, the, gravitational, effect, at, every, point, in, space, in, fact, the, curvature, of, space, time, completely, replaced, newton, s, universal, law, of, gravitation, according, to, einstein, gravitational, force, in, the, normal, sense, is, a, kind, of, illusion, caused, by, the, geometry, of, space, the, presence, of, a, mass, causes, a, curvature, of, space, time, in, the, vicinity, of, the, mass, and, this, curvature, dictates, the, space, time, path, that, all, freely, moving, objects, must, follow, it, was, also, predicted, from, this, theory, that, light, should, be, subject, to, gravity, all, of, which, was, verified, experimentally, this, aspect, of, relativity, explained, the, phenomena, of, light, bending, around, the, sun, predicted, black, holes, as, well, as, properties, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, a, discovery, rendering, fundamental, anomalies, in, the, classic, steady, state, hypothesis, for, his, work, on, relativity, the, photoelectric, effect, and, blackbody, radiation, einstein, received, the, nobel, prize, in, 1921, the, gradual, acceptance, of, einstein, s, theories, of, relativity, and, the, quantized, nature, of, light, transmission, and, of, niels, bohr, s, model, of, the, atom, created, as, many, problems, as, they, solved, leading, to, a, full, scale, effort, to, reestablish, physics, on, new, fundamental, principles, expanding, relativity, to, cases, of, accelerating, reference, frames, the, general, theory, of, relativity, in, the, 1910s, einstein, posited, an, equivalence, between, the, inertial, force, of, acceleration, and, the, force, of, gravity, leading, to, the, conclusion, that, space, is, curved, and, finite, in, size, and, the, prediction, of, such, phenomena, as, gravitational, lensing, and, the, distortion, of, time, in, gravitational, fields, although, relativity, resolved, the, electromagnetic, phenomena, conflict, demonstrated, by, michelson, and, morley, a, second, theoretical, problem, was, the, explanation, of, the, distribution, of, electromagnetic, radiation, emitted, by, a, black, body, experiment, showed, that, at, shorter, wavelengths, toward, the, ultraviolet, end, of, the, spectrum, the, energy, approached, zero, but, classical, theory, predicted, it, should, become, infinite, this, glaring, discrepancy, known, as, the, ultraviolet, catastrophe, was, solved, by, the, new, theory, of, quantum, mechanics, quantum, mechanics, is, the, theory, of, atoms, and, subatomic, systems, approximately, the, first, 30, years, of, the, 20th, century, represent, the, time, of, the, conception, and, evolution, of, the, theory, the, basic, ideas, of, quantum, theory, were, introduced, in, 1900, by, max, planck, 1858, 1947, who, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, for, physics, in, 1918, for, his, discovery, of, the, quantified, nature, of, energy, the, quantum, theory, which, previously, relied, in, the, correspondence, at, large, scales, between, the, quantized, world, of, the, atom, and, the, continuities, of, the, classical, world, was, accepted, when, the, compton, effect, established, that, light, carries, momentum, and, can, scatter, off, particles, and, when, louis, de, broglie, asserted, that, matter, can, be, seen, as, behaving, as, a, wave, in, much, the, same, way, as, electromagnetic, waves, behave, like, particles, wave, particle, duality, in, 1905, einstein, used, the, quantum, theory, to, explain, the, photoelectric, effect, and, in, 1913, the, danish, physicist, niels, bohr, used, the, same, constant, to, explain, the, stability, of, rutherford, s, atom, as, well, as, the, frequencies, of, light, emitted, by, hydrogen, gas, the, quantized, theory, of, the, atom, gave, way, to, a, full, scale, quantum, mechanics, in, the, 1920s, new, principles, of, a, quantum, rather, than, a, classical, mechanics, formulated, in, matrix, form, by, werner, heisenberg, max, born, and, pascual, jordan, in, 1925, were, based, on, the, probabilistic, relationship, between, discrete, states, and, denied, the, possibility, of, causality, quantum, mechanics, was, extensively, developed, by, heisenberg, wolfgang, pauli, paul, dirac, and, erwin, schr, dinger, who, established, an, equivalent, theory, based, on, waves, in, 1926, but, heisenberg, s, 1927, uncertainty, principle, indicating, the, impossibility, of, precisely, and, simultaneously, measuring, position, and, momentum, and, the, copenhagen, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, named, after, bohr, s, home, city, continued, to, deny, the, possibility, of, fundamental, causality, though, opponents, such, as, einstein, would, metaphorically, assert, that, god, does, not, play, dice, with, the, universe, the, new, quantum, mechanics, became, an, indispensable, tool, in, the, investigation, and, explanation, of, phenomena, at, the, atomic, level, also, in, the, 1920s, the, indian, scientist, satyendra, nath, bose, s, work, on, photons, and, quantum, mechanics, provided, the, foundation, for, bose, einstein, statistics, the, theory, of, the, bose, einstein, condensate, the, spin, statistics, theorem, established, that, any, particle, in, quantum, mechanics, may, be, either, a, boson, statistically, bose, einstein, or, a, fermion, statistically, fermi, dirac, it, was, later, found, that, all, fundamental, bosons, transmit, forces, such, as, the, photon, that, transmits, electromagnetism, fermions, are, particles, like, electrons, and, nucleons, and, are, the, usual, constituents, of, matter, fermi, dirac, statistics, later, found, numerous, other, uses, from, astrophysics, see, degenerate, matter, to, semiconductor, design, as, the, philosophically, inclined, continued, to, debate, the, fundamental, nature, of, the, universe, quantum, theories, continued, to, be, produced, beginning, with, paul, dirac, s, formulation, of, a, relativistic, quantum, theory, in, 1928, however, attempts, to, quantize, electromagnetic, theory, entirely, were, stymied, throughout, the, 1930s, by, theoretical, formulations, yielding, infinite, energies, this, situation, was, not, considered, adequately, resolved, until, after, world, war, ii, ended, when, julian, schwinger, richard, feynman, and, sin, itiro, tomonaga, independently, posited, the, technique, of, renormalization, which, allowed, for, an, establishment, of, a, robust, quantum, electrodynamics, qed, meanwhile, new, theories, of, fundamental, particles, proliferated, with, the, rise, of, the, idea, of, the, quantization, of, fields, through, exchange, forces, regulated, by, an, exchange, of, short, lived, virtual, particles, which, were, allowed, to, exist, according, to, the, laws, governing, the, uncertainties, inherent, in, the, quantum, world, notably, hideki, yukawa, proposed, that, the, positive, charges, of, the, nucleus, were, kept, together, courtesy, of, a, powerful, but, short, range, force, mediated, by, a, particle, with, a, mass, between, that, of, the, electron, and, proton, this, particle, the, pion, was, identified, in, 1947, as, part, of, what, became, a, slew, of, particles, discovered, after, world, war, ii, initially, such, particles, were, found, as, ionizing, radiation, left, by, cosmic, rays, but, increasingly, came, to, be, produced, in, newer, and, more, powerful, particle, accelerators, outside, particle, physics, significant, advances, of, the, time, were, einstein, deemed, that, all, fundamental, interactions, in, nature, can, be, explained, in, a, single, theory, unified, field, theories, were, numerous, attempts, to, merge, several, interactions, one, of, many, formulations, of, such, theories, as, well, as, field, theories, in, general, is, a, gauge, theory, a, generalization, of, the, idea, of, symmetry, eventually, the, standard, model, see, below, succeeded, in, unification, of, strong, weak, and, electromagnetic, interactions, all, attempts, to, unify, gravitation, with, something, else, failed, when, parity, was, broken, in, weak, interactions, by, chien, shiung, wu, in, her, experiment, a, series, of, discoveries, were, created, thereafter, the, interaction, of, these, particles, by, scattering, and, decay, provided, a, key, to, new, fundamental, quantum, theories, murray, gell, mann, and, yuval, ne, eman, brought, some, order, to, these, new, particles, by, classifying, them, according, to, certain, qualities, beginning, with, what, gell, mann, referred, to, as, the, eightfold, way, while, its, further, development, the, quark, model, at, first, seemed, inadequate, to, describe, strong, nuclear, forces, allowing, the, temporary, rise, of, competing, theories, such, as, the, s, matrix, the, establishment, of, quantum, chromodynamics, in, the, 1970s, finalized, a, set, of, fundamental, and, exchange, particles, which, allowed, for, the, establishment, of, a, standard, model, based, on, the, mathematics, of, gauge, invariance, which, successfully, described, all, forces, except, for, gravitation, and, which, remains, generally, accepted, within, its, domain, of, application, the, standard, model, based, on, the, yang, mills, theory, groups, the, electroweak, interaction, theory, and, quantum, chromodynamics, into, a, structure, denoted, by, the, gauge, group, su, 3, su, 2, u, 1, the, formulation, of, the, unification, of, the, electromagnetic, and, weak, interactions, in, the, standard, model, is, due, to, abdus, salam, steven, weinberg, and, subsequently, sheldon, glashow, electroweak, theory, was, later, confirmed, experimentally, by, observation, of, neutral, weak, currents, and, distinguished, by, the, 1979, nobel, prize, in, physics, since, the, 1970s, fundamental, particle, physics, has, provided, insights, into, early, universe, cosmology, particularly, the, big, bang, theory, proposed, as, a, consequence, of, einstein, s, general, theory, of, relativity, however, starting, in, the, 1990s, astronomical, observations, have, also, provided, new, challenges, such, as, the, need, for, new, explanations, of, galactic, stability, dark, matter, and, the, apparent, acceleration, in, the, expansion, of, the, universe, dark, energy, while, accelerators, have, confirmed, most, aspects, of, the, standard, model, by, detecting, expected, particle, interactions, at, various, collision, energies, no, theory, reconciling, general, relativity, with, the, standard, model, has, yet, been, found, although, supersymmetry, and, string, theory, were, believed, by, many, theorists, to, be, a, promising, avenue, forward, the, large, hadron, collider, however, which, began, operating, in, 2008, has, failed, to, find, any, evidence, that, is, supportive, of, supersymmetry, and, string, theory, cosmology, may, be, said, to, have, become, a, serious, research, question, with, the, publication, of, einstein, s, general, theory, of, relativity, in, 1915, although, it, did, not, enter, the, scientific, mainstream, until, the, period, known, as, the, golden, age, of, general, relativity, about, a, decade, later, in, the, midst, of, what, was, dubbed, the, great, debate, hubble, and, slipher, discovered, the, expansion, of, universe, in, the, 1920s, measuring, the, redshifts, of, doppler, spectra, from, galactic, nebulae, using, einstein, s, general, relativity, lema, tre, and, gamow, formulated, what, would, become, known, as, the, big, bang, theory, a, rival, called, the, steady, state, theory, was, devised, by, hoyle, gold, narlikar, and, bondi, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, was, verified, in, the, 1960s, by, penzias, and, wilson, and, this, discovery, favoured, the, big, bang, at, the, expense, of, the, steady, state, scenario, later, work, was, by, smoot, et, al, 1989, among, other, contributors, using, data, from, the, cosmic, background, explorer, cobe, and, the, wilkinson, microwave, anisotropy, probe, wmap, satellites, that, refined, these, observations, the, 1980s, the, same, decade, of, the, cobe, measurements, also, saw, the, proposal, of, inflation, theory, by, alan, guth, recently, the, problems, of, dark, matter, and, dark, energy, have, risen, to, the, top, of, the, cosmology, agenda, on, july, 4, 2012, physicists, working, at, cern, s, large, hadron, collider, announced, that, they, had, discovered, a, new, subatomic, particle, greatly, resembling, the, higgs, boson, a, potential, key, to, an, understanding, of, why, elementary, particles, have, mass, and, indeed, to, the, existence, of, diversity, and, life, in, the, universe, for, now, some, physicists, are, calling, it, a, higgslike, particle, joe, incandela, of, the, university, of, california, santa, barbara, said, it, s, something, that, may, in, the, end, be, one, of, the, biggest, observations, of, any, new, phenomena, in, our, field, in, the, last, 30, or, 40, years, going, way, back, to, the, discovery, of, quarks, for, example, michael, turner, a, cosmologist, at, the, university, of, chicago, and, the, chairman, of, the, physics, center, board, said, this, is, a, big, moment, for, particle, physics, and, a, crossroads, will, this, be, the, high, water, mark, or, will, it, be, the, first, of, many, discoveries, that, point, us, toward, solving, the, really, big, questions, that, we, have, posed, peter, higgs, was, one, of, six, physicists, working, in, three, independent, groups, who, in, 1964, invented, the, notion, of, the, higgs, field, cosmic, molasses, the, others, were, tom, kibble, of, imperial, college, london, carl, hagen, of, the, university, of, rochester, gerald, guralnik, of, brown, university, and, fran, ois, englert, and, robert, brout, both, of, universit, libre, de, bruxelles, although, they, have, never, been, seen, higgslike, fields, play, an, important, role, in, theories, of, the, universe, and, in, string, theory, under, certain, conditions, according, to, the, strange, accounting, of, einsteinian, physics, they, can, become, suffused, with, energy, that, exerts, an, antigravitational, force, such, fields, have, been, proposed, as, the, source, of, an, enormous, burst, of, expansion, known, as, inflation, early, in, the, universe, and, possibly, as, the, secret, of, the, dark, energy, that, now, seems, to, be, speeding, up, the, expansion, of, the, universe, with, increased, accessibility, to, and, elaboration, upon, advanced, analytical, techniques, in, the, 19th, century, physics, was, defined, as, much, if, not, more, by, those, techniques, than, by, the, search, for, universal, principles, of, motion, and, energy, and, the, fundamental, nature, of, matter, fields, such, as, acoustics, geophysics, astrophysics, aerodynamics, plasma, physics, low, temperature, physics, and, solid, state, physics, joined, optics, fluid, dynamics, electromagnetism, and, mechanics, as, areas, of, physical, research, in, the, 20th, century, physics, also, became, closely, allied, with, such, fields, as, electrical, aerospace, and, materials, engineering, and, physicists, began, to, work, in, government, and, industrial, laboratories, as, much, as, in, academic, settings, following, world, war, ii, the, population, of, physicists, increased, dramatically, and, came, to, be, centered, on, the, united, states, while, in, more, recent, decades, physics, has, become, a, more, international, pursuit, than, at, any, time, in, its, previous, history
