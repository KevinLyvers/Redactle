ancient, indian, dynasty, most, modern, scholars, believe, that, the, satavahana, rule, began, in, the, late, second, century, bce, and, lasted, until, the, early, third, century, ce, although, some, assign, the, beginning, of, their, rule, to, as, early, as, the, 3rd, century, bce, based, on, the, puranas, but, uncorroborated, by, archaeological, evidence, the, satavahana, kingdom, mainly, comprised, the, present, day, andhra, pradesh, telangana, and, maharashtra, at, different, times, their, rule, extended, to, parts, of, modern, gujarat, madhya, pradesh, and, karnataka, the, dynasty, had, different, capital, cities, at, different, times, including, kotalingala, telangana, pratishthana, paithan, and, amaravati, dharanikota, the, origin, of, the, dynasty, is, uncertain, but, according, to, the, puranas, their, first, king, overthrew, the, kanva, dynasty, in, the, post, maurya, era, the, satavahanas, established, peace, in, the, deccan, region, and, resisted, the, onslaught, of, foreign, invaders, in, particular, their, struggles, with, the, saka, western, satraps, went, on, for, a, long, time, the, dynasty, reached, its, zenith, under, the, rule, of,

from, the, indo, gangetic, plain, to, the, southern, tip, of, india, the, date, and, place, of, origin, of, the, satavahanas, as, well, as, the, meaning, of, the, dynasty, s, name, are, a, matter, of, debate, among, historians, some, of, these, debates, have, happened, in, the, context, of, regionalism, with, the, present, day, maharashtra, andhra, pradesh, karnataka, and, telangana, being, variously, claimed, as, the, original, homeland, of, the, satavahanas, tav, hana, liv, hana, takar, i, seem, to, be, sanskritised, versions, of, the, indigenous, name, s, taka, i, which, appear, as, s, lav, ha, a, in, prakrit, vernacular, according, to, one, theory, the, word, satavahana, brahmi, script, s, dav, hana, or, s, tav, hana, iast, s, tav, hana, is, a, prakrit, form, of, the, sanskrit, sapta, vahana, driven, by, seven, in, hindu, mythology, the, chariot, of, the, sun, god, is, drawn, by, seven, horses, this, would, indicate, that, the, satavahanas, originally, claimed, association, with, the, legendary, solar, dynasty, as, was, common, in, ancient, india, according, to, inguva, kartikeya, sarma, the, dynasty, s, name, is, derived, from, the, words, sata, sharpened, nimble, or, swift, and, vahana, vehicle, the, expression, thus, means, one, who, rides, a, nimble, horse, another, theory, connects, their, name, to, the, earlier, satiyaputa, dynasty, yet, another, theory, derives, their, name, from, the, munda, words, sadam, horse, and, harpan, son, implying, son, of, the, performer, of, a, horse, sacrifice, several, rulers, of, the, dynasty, bear, the, name, or, title, satakarni, satavahana, satakarni, satakani, and, shalivahana, appear, to, be, variations, of, the, same, word, damodar, dharmanand, kosambi, theorised, that, the, word, satakarni, is, derived, from, the, munda, words, sada, horse, and, kon, son, the, puranas, use, the, name, andhra, for, the, satavahanas, the, term, andhra, may, refer, to, the, ethnicity, or, territory, of, the, dynasty,

tav, hana, or, s, ta, supported, the, use, of, the, names, andhra, and, andhra, jatiya, in, the, puranas, has, led, some, scholars, such, as, e, j, rapson, and, r, g, bhandarkar, to, believe, that, the, dynasty, originated, in, the, eastern, deccan, region, the, historic, andhra, region, present, day, andhra, pradesh, and, telangana, at, kotilingala, in, telangana, coins, bearing, the, legend,

goyal, theorised, that, kotlingala, was, the, original, home, of, the, satavahanas, ajay, mitra, shastri, stated, that, the, finding, of, the, coins, at, kotilingala, give, a, clear, pointer, to, the, region, where, we, have, to, locate, the, original, center, of, the, satavahana, political, authority, however, the, coin, samples, from, kotlingala, are, small, and, it, is, not, certain, if, these, coins, were, minted, there, or, reached, there, from, somewhere, else, moreover, the, identification, of, chimuka, of, kotilingala, with, the, dynasty, s, founder, simuka, has, been, contested, by, several, scholars, including, p, l, gupta, and, i, k, sarma, who, identified, chimuka, as, a, later, ruler, p, v, p, sastry, also, later, changed, his, view, and, stated, that, the, two, kings, were, different, in, addition, to, the, kotilinga, find, a, coin, of, the, satavahana, prince, saktikumara, who, was, in, the, fourth, generation, of, the, founder, has, been, reported, as, a, stratified, find, from, the, kurnool, district, of, andhra, pradesh, as, for, the, puranas, these, texts, could, have, been, compiled, at, a, later, date, and, it, is, not, certain, if, the, satavahanas, were, referred, to, as, andhras, during, their, time, another, section, of, scholars, believe, that, the, satavahanas, originated, in, western, deccan, present, day, maharashtra, all, four, extant, inscriptions, from, the, early, satavahana, period, c, 1st, century, bce, have, been, found, in, and, around, this, region, one, of, the, earliest, known, satavahana, inscriptions, was, that, found, at, cave, no, 19, of, the, pandavleni, caves, in, nashik, district, which, was, issued, during, the, reign, of, kanha, 100, 70, bce, an, inscription, found, at, naneghat, was, issued, by, nayanika, or, naganika, the, widow, of, satakarni, i, another, inscription, found, at, naneghat, has, been, dated, to, the, same, period, on, a, paleographic, basis, a, slightly, later, inscription, dated, to, the, reign, of, satakarni, ii, has, been, found, at, sanchi, in, madhya, pradesh, located, to, the, north, of, maharashtra, the, majority, of, the, other, satavahana, inscriptions, have, also, been, found, in, western, deccan, on, the, other, hand, the, epigraphic, evidence, from, eastern, deccan, does, not, mention, the, satavahanas, before, the, 4th, century, ce, at, nevasa, a, seal, and, coins, attributed, to, kanha, have, been, discovered, coins, attributed, to, satakarni, i, have, also, been, discovered, at, nashik, nevasa, and, pauni, in, maharashtra, besides, places, in, eastern, deccan, and, present, day, madhya, pradesh, based, on, this, evidence, some, historians, argue, that, the, satavahanas, initially, came, to, power, in, the, area, around, their, capital, pratishthana, modern, paithan, maharashtra, and, then, expanded, their, territory, to, eastern, deccan, carla, sinopoli, cautions, that, the, inference, about, the, western, deccan, origin, of, the, satavahanas, is, tentative, at, best, given, the, small, sample, of, early, inscriptions, kanha, s, pandavleni, mentions, the, term, maha, matra, officer, in, charge, which, indicates, that, the, early, satavahanas, followed, the, mauryan, administrative, model, c, margabandhu, theorised, that, the, satavahanas, were, called, andhras, because, they, were, natives, of, eastern, deccan, the, andhra, region, although, they, first, established, their, empire, in, western, deccan, after, having, served, as, mauryan, subordinates, himanshu, prabha, ray, 1986, opposes, this, theory, stating, that, the, andhra, was, originally, an, ethnic, term, and, did, not, come, to, denote, the, geographical, region, of, eastern, deccan, until, well, after, the, satavahana, period, according, to, vidya, dehejia, the, writers, of, the, puranas, which, could, have, been, written, after, the, satavahana, period, mistook, the, satavahana, presence, in, eastern, deccan, as, evidence, for, their, origin, in, that, region, and, wrongly, labelled, them, as, andhra, puranas, called, the, satavahana, kings, as, andhra, andhra, bh, tya, or, andhra, jatiya, andhra, is, both, a, tribal, and, a, territorial, name, the, latter, territorial, denotation, of, present, telugu, lands, came, into, usage, only, well, after, the, satavahana, period, had, ended, which, meant, that, the, term, andhra, represented, only, the, andhra, tribe, who, had, originated, in, north, india, along, the, yamuna, river, banks, as, per, rigveda, and, not, the, present, andhra, region, or, its, telugu, people, the, term, andhrabhrityas, andhra, servants, may, imply, two, things, one, being, that, the, andhras, were, originally, servants, of, the, mauryas, or, the, sungas, the, other, one, as, per, some, scholars, is, that, the, expression, is, taken, to, indicate, the, servants, of, some, other, andhra, rulers, these, scholars, also, suggest, kannada, origin, for, the, satavahanas, meaning, that, the, dynasty, originated, in, present, day, karnataka, and, initially, owed, allegiance, to, some, andhra, rulers, a, satavahana, inscription, found, on, a, slab, of, the, upper, drum, medhi, of, the, kanaganahalli, mahastupa, mentions, year, 16, of, vasisthiputra, sri, chimuka, satavahana, s, reign, which, can, be, dated, from, ca, 110, bce, v, s, sukthankar, theorised, that, the, territorial, division, satavahani, satahani, satavahanihara, or, satahani, rattha, in, present, day, bellary, district, was, the, homeland, of, the, satavahana, family, however, dr, gopalchari, challenged, sukthankar, s, theory, by, pointing, out, that, not, a, single, inscription, of, the, early, satavahanas, is, found, in, bellary, district, and, that, the, only, satavahana, inscription, in, bellary, district, was, that, of, pulumavi, who, belongs, to, the, later, phase, of, satavahana, history, a, stupa, in, kanaganahalli, village, of, karnataka, dated, between, the, first, century, bce, and, first, century, ce, features, limestone, panels, depicting, portraits, of, chimuka, simuka, satakani, satakarni, and, other, satavahana, rulers, as, per, historian, parmanand, gupta, in, the, medieval, times, srisailam, region, or, the, sriparvata, area, was, known, as, kannadu, and, kannavisaya, which, is, the, contracted, form, of, satakarninadu, and, satakarnivisaya, which, seem, to, be, identical, with, the, territorial, indicator, satavahanihara, of, the, myakadoni, inscription, of, pulumayi, or, the, satavahaniratta, of, the, hirahadagalli, grant, consisting, of, the, ballari, region, indicated, to, be, the, original, homeland, of, the, satavahanas, as, per, another, historian, v, s, sukthankar, the, varna, of, the, dynasty, is, debated, by, modern, scholars, who, have, variously, argued, for, shudra, kshatriya, and, brahmana, origins, of, the, dynasty, the, puranas, call, the, founder, of, the, satavahana, family, a, v, ala, shudra, or, low, born, the, nashik, inscription, of, gautami, balashri, describes, her, son, gautamiputra, satakarni, as, eka, bamhana, sanskrit, eka, brahmana, some, scholars, such, as, v, v, mirashi, have, interpreted, the, term, as, sole, brahmana, and, argued, that, satavahanas, were, brahmanas, hem, chandra, raychaudhuri, interprets, the, term, as, unique, brahmana, and, notes, that, the, inscription, also, describes, gautamiputra, as, the, destroyer, of, the, pride, and, conceit, of, kshatriyas, which, according, to, him, strongly, suggests, that, gautamiputra, claimed, to, be, a, brahmana, the, critics, of, this, theory, point, out, that, gautamiputra, s, family, had, matrimonial, relations, with, the, non, brahmana, shakas, and, the, satavahanas, could, not, have, been, brahmanas, because, the, same, inscription, also, describes, gautamiputra, as, the, one, who, stopped, admixture, of, varnas, vinivatita, chatu, vana, sankara, historian, v, sundara, rama, sastry, argues, that, the, interpretation, of, the, term, eka, bamhana, as, the, only, brahmana, does, not, make, sense, as, the, king, was, obviously, not, the, only, member, of, his, varna, instead, he, interprets, the, term, as, an, epithet, indicating, that, the, king, excelled, even, the, brahmans, historian, r, g, bhandarkar, interprets, the, term, the, only, protector, of, the, brahmanas, some, jain, works, and, the, dv, tri, at, puttalik, represent, shalivahana, whom, some, modern, scholars, identify, as, a, satavahana, king, as, of, mixed, brahmana, and, naga, origin, based, on, this, some, scholars, such, as, d, c, sircar, theorize, that, the, satavahanas, were, originally, non, brahmanas, who, started, claiming, brahmana, status, after, establishing, matrimonial, relations, with, some, brahmana, families, information, about, the, satavahanas, comes, from, the, puranas, some, buddhist, and, jain, texts, the, dynasty, s, inscriptions, and, coins, and, foreign, greek, and, roman, accounts, that, focus, on, trade, the, information, provided, by, these, sources, is, not, sufficient, to, reconstruct, the, dynasty, s, history, with, absolute, certainty, as, a, result, there, are, multiple, theories, about, the, satavahana, chronology, simuka, is, mentioned, as, the, first, king, in, a, list, of, royals, in, a, satavahana, inscription, at, naneghat, the, various, puranas, state, that, the, first, king, of, the, dynasty, ruled, for, 23, years, and, mention, his, name, variously, as, sishuka, sindhuka, chhismaka, shipraka, etc, these, are, believed, to, be, corrupted, spellings, of, simuka, resulting, from, copying, and, re, copying, of, manuscripts, simuka, cannot, be, dated, with, certainty, based, on, available, evidence, based, on, the, following, theories, the, beginning, of, the, satavahana, rule, is, dated, variously, from, 271, bce, to, 30, bce, according, to, the, puranas, the, first, andhra, king, overthrew, the, kanva, rule, he, is, named, as, balipuccha, in, some, texts, d, c, sircar, dated, this, event, to, c, 30, bce, a, theory, supported, by, many, other, scholars, the, matsya, purana, mentions, that, the, andhra, dynasty, ruled, for, around, 450, years, as, the, satavahana, rule, ended, in, the, early, 3rd, century, the, beginning, of, their, rule, can, be, dated, to, the, 3rd, century, bce, the, indica, of, megasthenes, 350, 290, bce, mentions, a, powerful, tribe, named, andarae, whose, king, maintained, an, army, of, 100, 000, infantry, 2, 000, cavalry, and, 1, 000, elephants, if, andarae, is, identified, with, the, andhras, this, can, be, considered, additional, evidence, of, satavahana, rule, starting, in, the, 3rd, century, bce, the, brahmanda, purana, states, that, the, four, kanvas, will, rule, the, earth, for, 45, years, then, it, will, again, go, to, the, andhras, based, on, this, statement, the, proponents, of, this, theory, argue, that, the, satavahana, rule, began, immediately, after, the, maurya, rule, followed, by, a, kanva, interregnum, and, then, a, revival, of, the, satavahana, rule, according, to, one, version, of, the, theory, simuka, succeeded, the, mauryans, a, variation, of, the, theory, is, that, simuka, was, the, person, who, restored, the, satavahana, rule, by, overthrowing, the, kanvas, the, compiler, of, the, puranas, confused, him, with, the, founder, of, the, dynasty, most, modern, scholars, believe, that, the, satavahana, ruler, began, in, the, first, century, bce, and, lasted, until, the, second, century, ce, this, theory, is, based, on, puranic, records, as, well, as, archaeological, and, numismatic, evidence, the, theory, that, dates, their, rule, to, an, earlier, period, is, now, largely, discredited, because, the, various, puranas, contradict, each, other, and, are, not, fully, supported, by, epigraphic, or, numismatic, evidence, the, oldest, satavahana, inscription, is, the, one, found, on, a, slab, of, the, upper, drum, medhi, of, the, kanaganahalli, great, stupa, mentioning, year, 16, of, vasisthiputra, sri, chimuka, satavahana, s, reign, which, can, be, dated, from, ca, 110, bce, rano, siri, chimu, ka, s, tav, hanasa, so, e, vachare, 10, 6, m, tiseka, in,

by, greek, invasions, of, northern, india, he, performed, vedic, sacrifices, including, ashvamedha, and, rajasuya, instead, of, the, buddhists, he, patronised, brahmins, and, donated, a, substantial, amount, of, wealth, to, them, the, hathigumpha, inscription, of, the, kalinga, king, kharavela, mentions, a, king, named, satakani, or, satakamini, who, some, identify, with, satakarni, i, the, inscription, describes, dispatching, of, an, army, and, kharavela, s, threat, to, a, city, since, the, inscription, is, only, partially, legible, different, scholars, interpret, the, events,

wanted, to, avoid, an, invasion, of, his, kingdom, by, kharavela, so, he, sent, horses, elephants, chariots, and, men, to, kharavela, as, a, tribute, according, to, sudhakar, chattopadhyaya, kharavela, s, army, diverted, its, course, after, failing, to, advance, against, satakarni, according, to, alain, dani, lou, kharavela, was, friendly, with, satakarni, and, only, crossed, his, kingdom, without, any, clashes, satakarni, s, successor, satakarni, ii, ruled, for, 56, years, during, which, he, captured, eastern, malwa, from, the, shungas, this, allowed, him, access, to, the, buddhist, site, of, sanchi, in, which, he, is, credited, with, the, building, of, the, decorated, gateways, around, the, original, mauryan, empire, and, sunga, stupas, satakarni, ii, is, known, from, a, dedicatory, inscription, at, sanchi, he, was, succeeded, by, lambodara, the, coins, of, lambodara, s, son, and, successor, apilaka, have, been, found, in, eastern, madhya, pradesh, however, andrew, ollett, argues, that, there, is, only, one, satakarni, as, the, alleged, first, satakarni, is, assigned, ten, years, and, the, second, fifty, years, by, other, scholars, but, the, only, dated, inscription, of, this, king, is, candankheda, seal, from, his, reign, s, year, 30, around, 60, bce, and, he, ruled, ca, 88, 42, bce, the, satavahanas, contributed, greatly, to, the, embellishment, of,

epigraphic, and, numismatic, evidence, suggests, that, the, satavahanas, earlier, controlled, the, northern, deccan, plateau, the, northern, konkan, coastal, plains, and, the, mountain, passes, connecting, these, two, regions, during, 15, 40, ce, their, northern, neighbours, the, western, kshatrapas, extended, their, influence, into, these, regions, the, western, kshatrapa, ruler, nahapana,

who, obtained, good, report, because, he, in, spite, of, having, twice, in, fair, fight, completely, defeated, satakarni, the, lord, of, dakshinapatha, on, account, of, the, nearness, of, their,

into, five, smaller, kingdoms, the, satavahana, territory, included, northern, deccan, region, spanning, the, present, day, andhra, pradesh, maharashtra, and, telangana, states, at, times, their, rule, also, extended, to, present, day, gujarat, karnataka, and, madhya, pradesh, the, nashik, prashasti, inscription, issued, by, gautami, balashri, the, mother, of, gautamiputra, satakarni, claims, that, her, son, ruled, an, extensive, territory, that, stretched, from, gujarat, in, the, north, to, northern, karnataka, in, the, south, it, is, not, clear, if, gautamiputra, had, effective, control, over, these, claimed, territories, in, any, case, historical, evidence, suggests, that, his, control, over, these, territories, did, not, last, long, moreover, this, realm, was, not, continuous, many, areas, in, this, region, remained, under, the, control, of, the, hunter, gatherers, and, other, tribal, communities, as, per, historian, m, govinda, pai, ptolemy, 100, 170, ce, states, that, when, siro, polemaios, vasishthiputra, sri, pulumayi, was, ruling, from, his, capital, paithan, in, the, north, reign, c, 85, 125, ce, another, satavahana, prince, called, baleokouros, or, baleokoura, vilivayakura, was, ruling, from, hippokoura, huvina, hipparagi, of, basavana, bagewadi, taluk, of, vijayapura, district, of, present, karnataka, in, the, south, who, was, none, other, than, his, own, son, pai, identifies, this, prince, vilivaya, kura, as, another, form, of, vilivaya, kumara, meaning, the, son, of, vilivaya, and, he, goes, on, to, prove, that, vilivaya, is, indeed, merely, another, rendering, of, pulumayi, which, was, transformed, as, per, prakrit, rules, the, spoken, form, of, this, language, during, that, period, and, due, to, common, parlance, thus, vilivayakura, means, a, son, of, pulumayi, who, was, ruling, from, huvina, hipparagi, in, present, karnataka, pai, identifies, all, the, 10, cities, mentioned, by, ptolemy, as, lying, between, the, river, benda, or, binda, or, bhima, river, in, the, north, and, banaouasei, banavasi, in, the, south, viz, nagarouris, nagur, tabaso, tavasi, inde, indi, tiripangalida, gadhinglaj, hippokoura, huvina, hipparagi, soubouttou, savadi, sirimalaga, malkhed, kalligeris, kalkeri, modogoulla, mudgal, and, petirgala, pattadakal, as, being, located, in, northern, karnataka, the, satavahana, capital, kept, shifting, with, time, the, nashik, inscription, describes, gautamiputra, as, the, lord, of, benakataka, suggesting, that, this, was, the, name, of, his, capital, ptolemy, 2nd, century, ce, mentioned, pratishthana, modern, paithan, as, the, capital, of, pulumavi, at, other, times, the, satavahana, capitals, included, dharanikota, and, junnar, m, k, dhavalikar, theorised, that, the, original, satavahana, capital, was, located, at, junnar, but, had, to, be, moved, to, pratishthana, because, of, saka, kushana, incursions, from, the, north, west, several, satavahana, era, inscriptions, record, grants, to, religious, monasteries, the, settlements, most, frequently, mentioned, as, the, residences, of, donors, in, these, inscriptions, include, the, sea, ports, of, sopara, kalyan, bharuch, kuda, unidentified, and, chaul, the, most, frequently, mentioned, inland, settlements, include, dhanyakatakam, dharanikota, junnar, nashik, paithan, and, karad, other, important, satavahana, sites, in, western, deccan, include, govardhana, nevasa, ter, and, vadgaon, madhavpur, the, ones, in, eastern, deccan, include, amaravati, dhulikatta, kotalingala, and, peddabankur, the, satavahanas, followed, the, administration, guidelines, of, the, shastras, their, government, was, less, top, heavy, than, that, of, the, mauryans, and, featured, several, levels, of, feudatories, the, royal, princes, kumara, s, were, appointed, as, viceroys, of, the, provinces, the, ahara, appears, to, have, been, the, largest, geographical, subdivision, of, the, satavahana, polity, several, inscriptions, refer, to, aharas, named, after, the, governors, appointed, to, rule, them, e, g, govardhanahara, mamalahara, satavanihara, and, kapurahara, this, suggests, that, the, satavahanas, attempted, to, build, a, formal, administrative, and, revenue, collection, structure, the, inscriptions, of, gautamiputra, satakarni, suggest, the, existence, of, a, bureaucratic, structure, although, it, is, not, certain, how, stable, and, effective, this, structure, was, for, example, two, inscriptions, from, nashik, cave, 11, record, donations, of, agricultural, land, to, ascetic, communities, they, state, that, the, ascetics, would, enjoy, tax, exemption, and, non, interference, from, the, royal, officials, the, first, inscription, states, that, the, grant, was, approved, by, gautamiputra, s, minister, sivagupta, on, the, king, s, verbal, orders, and, preserved, by, the, great, lords, the, second, inscription, records, a, grant, by, gautamiputra, and, his, mother, and, mentions, syamaka, as, the, minister, of, the, govardhana, ahara, it, states, that, the, charter, was, approved, by, a, woman, named, lota, who, according, to, archaeologist, james, burgess, interpretation, was, the, chief, lady, in, waiting, of, gautamiputra, s, mother, the, satavahana, era, inscriptions, mention, three, types, of, settlements, nagara, city, nigama, market, town, and, g, ma, village, according, to, sastri, the, satavahanas, were, described, as, lords, of, the, three, oceans, and, promoted, overseas, colonization, and, trade, under, them, buddhist, art, attained, the, superb, forms, of, beauty, and, elegance, preserved, to, this, day, in, the, cave, temples, of, western, india, and, the, survivals, from, the, stupa, of, amaravati, goli, nagarjunikonda, this, tradition, was, followed, by, successors, of, satavahana, in, the, eastern, and, western, deccan, the, satavahanas, participated, in, and, benefited, from, economic, expansion, through, intensification, of, agriculture, increased, production, of, other, commodities, and, trade, within, and, beyond, the, indian, subcontinent, during, the, satavahana, period, several, large, settlements, emerged, in, the, fertile, areas, especially, along, the, major, rivers, the, amount, of, land, under, agricultural, use, also, expanded, significantly, as, a, result, of, forest, clearance, and, construction, of, irrigation, reservoirs, the, exploitation, of, sites, with, mineral, resources, may, have, increased, during, the, satavahana, period, leading, to, the, emergence, of, new, settlements, in, these, areas, such, sites, facilitated, commerce, and, crafts, such, as, ceramic, ware, the, increased, craft, production, during, the, satavahana, period, is, evident, from, archaeological, discoveries, at, sites, such, as, kotalingala, as, well, as, epigraphic, references, to, artisans, and, guilds, the, satavahanas, controlled, the, indian, sea, coast, and, as, a, result, they, dominated, the, growing, indian, trade, with, the, roman, empire, the, periplus, of, the, erythraean, sea, mentions, two, important, satavahana, trade, centres, pratishthana, and, tagara, other, important, urban, centres, included, kondapur, banavasi, and, madhavpur, nanaghat, was, the, site, of, an, important, pass, that, linked, the, satavahana, capital, pratishthana, to, the, sea, the, satavahanas, patronized, brahmanism, and, vedic, sacrifices, and, claimed, brahmanical, status, although, they, also, made, generous, donations, to, buddhist, monasteries, the, lay, people, in, the, satavahana, period, perhaps, generally, did, not, exclusively, support, a, particular, religious, group, the, naneghat, inscription, of, nayanika, recorded, on, the, walls, of, a, cave, mentions, that, her, husband, satakarni, i, performed, several, vedic, sacrifices, including, ashvamedha, horse, sacrifice, rajasuya, royal, consecration, and, agnyadheya, fire, ceremony, the, inscription, also, records, substantial, fees, paid, to, brahmin, priests, and, attendees, for, these, sacrifices, for, example, 10, 001, cows, were, granted, for, the, bhagala, dasaratra, sacrifice, and, 24, 400, coins, were, granted, for, another, sacrifice, whose, name, is, not, clear, a, number, of, buddhist, monastic, sites, emerged, in, the, deccan, region, during, the, satavahana, period, however, the, exact, relations, between, these, monasteries, and, the, satavahana, government, is, not, clear, the, pandavleni, caves, inscription, issued, during, the, reign, of, kanha, states, that, the, cave, was, excavated, by, maha, matra, officer, in, charge, of, the, shramanas, non, vedic, ascetics, based, on, this, sudhakar, chattopadhyaya, concludes, that, kanha, favoured, buddhism, and, had, an, administrative, department, dedicated, to, the, welfare, of, buddhist, monks, however, carla, m, sinopoli, notes, that, although, there, are, some, records, of, donations, to, the, buddhist, monasteries, by, the, satavahana, royals, the, vast, majority, of, the, donations, were, made, by, the, non, royals, the, most, common, among, these, donors, were, merchants, and, many, of, the, monasteries, were, located, along, the, important, trade, routes, the, merchants, probably, donated, to, the, monasteries, because, these, sites, facilitated, trade, by, serving, as, rest, houses, and, possibly, by, directly, participating, in, the, trade, the, monasteries, appear, to, have, been, an, important, venue, for, displaying, charitable, donations, including, the, donations, made, to, non, buddhists, especially, brahmins, most, of, the, satavahana, inscriptions, and, coin, legends, are, in, a, middle, indo, aryan, language, this, language, has, been, termed, prakrit, by, some, modern, scholars, but, this, terminology, can, be, considered, correct, only, if, the, term, prakrit, is, defined, broadly, to, include, every, middle, indo, aryan, language, that, is, not, exactly, sanskrit, the, language, of, the, inscriptions, is, actually, closer, to, sanskrit, than, to, the, literary, prakrit, used, in, the, gaha, sattasai, anthology, attributed, to, the, satavahana, king, hala, the, satvahanas, also, used, sanskrit, in, political, inscriptions, but, rarely, a, fragmentary, inscription, found, close, to, the, nashik, prashasti, of, gautamiputra, satakarni, uses, sanskrit, verses, in, vasanta, tilaka, metre, to, describe, a, deceased, king, probably, gautamiputra, a, sanskrit, inscription, found, at, sannati, probably, refers, to, gautamiputra, shri, satakarni, one, of, whose, coins, also, features, a, sanskrit, legend, according, to, gunadya, besides, sanskrit, and, prakrit, there, is, another, language, called, desi, which, may, mean, the, native, language, or, the, language, of, common, man, commenting, on, the, desi, language, dr, d, c, sircar, remarks, it, was, apparently, early, telugu, which, was, in, older, times, very, closer, to, tamil, than, it, is, now, was, the, mother, tongue, of, the, common, people, later, satavahana, kings, like, gauthamiputra, satakarni, vastistiputra, pulamovi, and, yajna, satakarni, had, their, names, in, two, languages, i, e, prakrit, and, desi, a, native, language, the, satavahanas, also, issued, bilingual, coins, featuring, middle, indo, aryan, language, on, one, side, and, desi, language, possibly, old, tamil, on, the, other, side, several, brahmi, script, inscriptions, are, available, from, the, satavahana, period, but, most, of, these, record, donations, to, buddhist, institutions, by, individuals, and, do, not, provide, much, information, about, the, dynasty, the, inscriptions, issued, by, the, satavahana, royals, themselves, also, primarily, concern, religious, donations, although, some, of, them, provide, some, information, about, the, rulers, and, the, imperial, structure, the, earliest, extant, satavahana, inscription, is, from, nashik, cave, 19, which, states, that, the, cave, was, commissioned, by, mahamatra, saman, of, nashik, during, the, reign, of, king, kanha, at, naneghat, an, inscription, issued, by, nayanika, the, widow, of, satakarni, i, has, been, found, it, records, nayanika, s, lineage, and, mentions, the, vedic, sacrifices, performed, by, the, royal, family, another, inscription, at, naneghat, comprises, names, of, satavahana, royals, appearing, as, labels, over, their, bas, relief, portraits, the, portraits, are, now, completely, eroded, but, the, inscription, is, believed, to, be, contemporary, to, nayanika, s, inscription, on, a, paleographic, basis, the, next, oldest, satavahana, era, inscription, appears, on, a, sculpted, gateway, element, of, stupa, 1, at, sanchi, it, states, that, the, element, was, donated, by, ananda, who, was, the, son, of, siri, satakarni, s, foreman, of, artisans, this, inscription, is, probably, from, the, reign, of, satakarni, ii, the, satavahanas, were, the, earliest, indian, rulers, to, issue, their, own, coins, with, portraits, of, their, rulers, starting, with, king, gautamiputra, satakarni, a, practice, derived, from, that, of, the, western, kshatrapas, he, defeated, the, western, satraps, themselves, had, been, following, the, features, of, the, coins, of, the, indo, greek, kings, to, the, northwest, thousands, of, lead, copper, and, potin, satavahana, coins, have, been, discovered, in, the, deccan, region, a, few, gold, and, silver, coins, are, also, available, these, coins, do, not, feature, uniform, design, or, size, and, suggest, that, multiple, minting, locations, existed, within, the, satavahana, territory, leading, to, regional, differences, in, coinage, the, coin, legends, of, the, satavahanas, in, all, areas, and, all, periods, used, a, prakrit, dialect, without, exception, in, addition, some, reverse, coin, legends, are, in, dravidian, more, similar, to, tamil, than, telugu, in, the, dravidian, script, similar, to, the, brahmi, script, apart, from, a, few, variations, several, coins, carry, titles, or, matronyms, that, were, common, to, multiple, rulers, e, g, satavahana, satakarni, and, pulumavi, so, the, number, of, rulers, attested, by, coinage, cannot, be, determined, with, certainty, the, names, of, 16, to, 20, rulers, appear, on, the, various, coins, some, of, these, rulers, appear, to, be, local, elites, rather, than, the, satavahana, monarchs, the, satavahana, coins, give, unique, indications, as, to, their, chronology, language, and, even, facial, features, curly, hair, long, ears, and, strong, lips, they, issued, mainly, lead, and, copper, coins, their, portrait, style, silver, coins, were, usually, struck, over, coins, of, the, western, kshatrapa, kings, the, satavahana, coins, also, display, various, traditional, symbols, such, as, elephants, lions, horses, and, chaityas, stupas, as, well, as, the, ujjain, symbol, a, cross, with, four, circles, at, the, end, the, satavahanas, patronised, the, prakrit, language, instead, of, sanskrit, the, satavahana, king, h, la, is, famous, for, compiling, the, collection, of, maharashtri, poems, known, as, the, gaha, sattasai, sanskrit, g, th, saptashat, although, from, linguistic, evidence, it, seems, that, the, work, now, extant, must, have, been, re, edited, in, the, succeeding, century, or, two, through, this, book, it, was, evident, that, agriculture, was, the, main, means, of, livelihood, also, many, sorts, of, superstitions, had, prevailed, additionally, gunadhya, the, minister, of, hala, was, the, author, of, brihatkatha, madhukar, keshav, dhavalikar, writes, that, the, satavahana, sculptures, unfortunately, has, never, been, recognized, as, an, independent, school, in, spite, of, the, fact, it, has, its, own, distinctive, characteristic, features, the, earliest, in, point, of, time, is, that, in, the, bhaja, vihara, cave, which, marks, the, beginning, of, sculptural, art, in, the, satavahana, dominion, around, 200bc, it, is, profusely, decorated, with, carvings, and, even, pillars, have, a, lotus, capital, crowned, with, sphinx, like, mythic, animals, dhavalikar, also, writes, that, in, chankama, the, panel, occurring, on, the, west, pillar, of, northern, gateway, portrays, a, very, important, event, in, buddha, s, life, it, depicts, votaries, two, each, on, either, side, of, what, looks, like, a, ladder, which, actually, is, the, promenade, which, buddha, is, supposed, to, have, walked, it, is, said, that, buddha, after, attaining, enlightment, spent, four, weeks, near, the, bodhi, tree, of, these, the, third, week, he, spent, walking, along, the, promenade, chankama, to, and, fro, along, with, some, of, the, above, major, satavahana, sculptures, some, more, sculptures, existed, namely, dvarapala, gajalaksmi, shalabhanjikas, royal, procession, decorative, pillar, etc, several, metal, figurines, are, found, that, could, be, attributed, to, the, satavahanas, a, hoard, of, unique, bronze, objects, were, also, found, from, bramhapuri, numerous, articles, obtained, from, there, were, indian, but, also, reflected, roman, and, italian, influence, a, small, statue, of, poseidon, wine, jugs, and, a, plaque, depicting, perseus, and, andromeda, were, also, obtained, from, the, house, from, where, the, objects, were, found, the, fine, elephant, in, the, ashmolean, museum, the, yaksi, image, in, the, british, museum, and, the, cornucopia, found, in, posheri, kept, at, chhatrapati, shivaji, maharaj, vastu, sangrahalaya, can, also, be, attributed, to, the, satavahana, period, the, sculptures, of, the, amaravati, stupa, and, the, wider, amaravati, style, represent, the, architectural, development, of, the, satavahana, periods, they, built, buddhist, stupas, in, amravati, 95, feet, high, they, also, constructed, a, large, number, of, stupas, at, goli, jaggiahpeta, ghantasala, amaravati, bhattiprolu, and, shri, parvatam, caves, ix, and, x, containing, ajanta, paintings, were, patronised, by, satavahana, and, the, painting, throughout, the, caves, appear, to, have, started, with, them, ashokan, stupas, were, enlarged, the, earlier, bricks, and, wood, works, being, replaced, with, stone, works, the, most, famous, of, these, monuments, are, the, stupas, the, most, famous, among, them, being, the, amravati, stupa, and, the, nagarjunakonda, stupa, the, satavahana, paintings, are, the, earliest, surviving, specimens, excluding, prehistoric, rock, art, in, india, and, they, are, to, be, found, only, at, the, ajanta, caves, there, were, two, phases, of, artistic, activity, of, ajanta, the, first, occurring, in, the, 2nd, to, 1st, centuries, bc, when, hinayana, caves, were, excavated, during, satavahana, rule, the, later, in, the, second, half, of, the, 5th, century, under, the, vakatakas, vagaries, of, nature, and, some, vandalism, have, taken, a, heavy, toll, on, the, ajanta, caves, only, a, few, fragments, related, to, the, satavahanas, have, survived, in, caves, no, 9, and, 10, both, of, which, are, chaitya, grihas, with, stupas, the, most, important, surviving, painting, of, the, satavahana, period, at, ajanta, is, the, chhadanta, jataka, in, cave, no, 10, but, that, too, is, only, fragmentary, it, is, a, painting, of, an, elephant, named, bodhisattva, with, six, tusks, related, to, a, mythological, story, the, human, figures, both, male, and, female, are, typically, satavahanas, almost, identical, with, their, counterparts, on, the, sanchi, gateways, so, far, as, their, physiognomy, costumes, and, jewellery, are, concerned, the, only, difference, is, that, the, sanchi, figures, have, shed, some, of, their, weight, the, satavahana, rulers, are, also, remarkable, for, their, contributions, to, buddhist, art, and, architecture, they, built, great, stupas, in, the, krishna, river, valley, including, the, stupa, at, amaravati, in, andhra, pradesh, the, stupas, were, decorated, in, marble, slabs, and, sculpted, with, subjects, including, scenes, from, the, life, of, the, buddha, portrayed, in, a, characteristic, slim, and, elegant, style, the, regional, amaravati, style, of, sculpture, also, influenced, the, sculpture, of, southeast, asia, multiple, puranas, contain, chronology, of, satavahana, kings,
