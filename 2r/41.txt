declaring, himself, its, king, hammurabi, conquered, southern, and, central, iraq, as, well, as, elam, to, the, east, and, mari, to, the, west, then, engaged, in, a, protracted, war, with, the, assyrian, king, ishme, dagan, for, domination, of, the, region, creating, the, short, lived, babylonian, empire, he, eventually, prevailed, over, the, successor, of, ishme, dagan, and, subjected,

is, from, the, period, of, hammurabi, that, southern, iraq, came, to, be, known, as, babylonia, while, the, north, had, already, coalesced, into, assyria, hundreds, of, years, before, however, his, empire, was, short, lived, and, rapidly, collapsed, after, his, death, with, both, assyria, and, southern, iraq, in, the, form, of, the, sealand, dynasty, falling, back, into, native, akkadian, hands, after, this, another, foreign, people, the, language, isolate, speaking, kassites, seized, control, of, babylonia, iraq, was, from, this, point, divided, into, three, polities, assyria, in, the,

assyria, and, elam, the, kassites, were, driven, from, power, by, assyria, and, elam, allowing, native, south, mesopotamian, kings, to, rule, babylonia, for, the, first, time, although, often, subject, to, assyrian, or, elamite, rulers, however, these, akkadian, kings, were, unable, to, prevent, new, waves, of, west, semitic, migrants, from, entering, southern, iraq, and, during, the, 11th, century, bc, arameans, and, suteans, entered, babylonia, from, the, levant, followed, in, the, late, 10th, to, early, 9th, century, bc, by, the, chaldeans, however, the, chaldeans, were, absorbed,

power, with, the, rise, of, the, middle, assyrian, empire, the, neo, assyrian, empire, 911, 609, bc, was, the, dominant, political, force, in, the, ancient, near, east, during, the, iron, age, eclipsing, babylonia, egypt, urartu, and, elam, because, of, its, geopolitical, dominance, and, ideology, based, on, world, domination, the, neo, assyrian, empire, is, regarded, by, many, researchers, as, the, first, world, empire, at, its, height, the, empire, ruled, over, all, of, mesopotamia, the, levant, and, egypt, as, well, as, portions, of, anatolia, the, arabian, peninsula, and, modern,

became, the, center, of, an, empire, stretching, from, persia, parthia, and, elam, in, the, east, to, cyprus, and, antioch, in, the, west, and, from, the, caucasus, in, the, north, to, egypt, nubia, and, arabia, in, the, south, it, was, during, this, period, that, an, akkadian, influenced, form, of, eastern, aramaic, was, adopted, by, the, assyrians, as, their, lingua, franca, and, mesopotamian, aramaic, began, to, supplant, akkadian, as, the, spoken, language, of, the, general, populace, of, both, assyria, and, babylonia, the, descendant, dialects, of, this, tongue, survive, among, the, mandaeans, of, southern, iraq, and, assyrians, of, northern, iraq, the, arabs, and, the, chaldeans, are, first, mentioned, in, written, history, circa, 850, bc, in, the, annals, of, shalmaneser, iii, the, neo, assyrian, empire, left, a, legacy, of, great, cultural, significance, the, political, structures, established, by, the, neo, assyrian, empire, became, the, model, for, the, later, empires, that, succeeded, it, and, the, ideology, of, universal, rule, promulgated, by, the, neo, assyrian, kings, inspired, similar, ideas, of, rights, to, world, domination, in, later, empires, the, neo, assyrian, empire, became, an, important, part, of, later, folklore, and, literary, traditions, in, northern, mesopotamia, judaism, and, thus, in, turn, also, christianity, and, islam, was, profoundly, affected, by, the, period, of, neo, assyrian, rule, numerous, biblical, stories, appear, to, draw, on, earlier, assyrian, mythology, and, history, and, the, assyrian, impact, on, early, jewish, theology, was, immense, although, the, neo, assyrian, empire, is, prominently, remembered, today, for, the, supposed, excessive, brutality, of, the, neo, assyrian, army, the, assyrians, were, not, excessively, brutal, compared, to, other, civilizations, in, the, late, 7th, century, bc, the, assyrian, empire, tore, itself, apart, with, a, series, of, brutal, civil, wars, weakening, itself, to, such, a, degree, that, a, coalition, of, its, former, subjects, including, the, babylonians, chaldeans, medes, persians, parthians, scythians, and, cimmerians, were, able, to, attack, assyria, finally, bringing, its, empire, down, by, 605, bc, the, short, lived, neo, babylonian, empire, 626, 539, bc, succeeded, that, of, assyria, it, failed, to, attain, the, size, power, or, longevity, of, its, predecessor, however, it, came, to, dominate, the, levant, canaan, arabia, israel, and, judah, and, even, defeated, egypt, initially, babylon, was, ruled, by, the, chaldeans, who, had, migrated, to, the, region, in, the, late, 10th, or, early, 9th, century, bc, its, greatest, king, nebuchadnezzar, ii, rivaled, hammurabi, as, the, greatest, king, of, babylon, however, by, 556, bc, the,

unprecedented, economic, and, population, growth, and, a, renaissance, of, culture, and, artwork, nebuchadnezzar, ii, succeeded, nabopolassar, in, 605, bc, the, empire, nebuchadnezzar, inherited, was, among, the, most, powerful, in, the, world, he, quickly, reinforced, his, father, s, alliance, with, the, medes, by, marrying, cyaxares, s, daughter, or, granddaughter, amytis, some, sources, suggest, that, the, famous, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, were, built, by, nebuchadnezzar, for, his, wife, though, the, existence, of, these, gardens, is, debated, nebuchadnezzar, s, 43, year, reign, brought, a, golden, age, for, babylon, which, became, the, most, powerful, kingdom, in, the, middle, east, the, neo, babylonian, period, ended, with,

necessity, these, to, be, determined, by, the, security, council, sanctions, committee, after, the, end, of, the, gulf, war, and, after, the, iraqi, withdrawal, from, kuwait, the, sanctions, were,
