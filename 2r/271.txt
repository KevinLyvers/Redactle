in, the, history, of, europe, the, middle, ages, or, medieval, period, also, spelt, mediaeval, or, medi, val, lasted, from, approximately, 500, to, 1500, ad, it, is, the, second, of, the, three, traditional, divisions, of, western, history, antiquity, medieval, and, modern, major, developments, include, the, economic, predominance, of, agriculture, exploitation, of, the, peasantry, slow, inter, regional, communication, the, importance, of, personal, relationships, in, power, structures, and, the, weakness, of, state, administration, the, period, is, sometimes, subdivided, into, the, early, high, and, late, middle, ages, and, the, early, medieval, period, is, alternatively, referred, to, as, the, dark, ages, population, decline, counterurbanisation, the, collapse, of, centralised, authority, the, mass, migration, of, tribes, mainly, germanic, peoples, and, christianisation, which, had, begun, in, late, antiquity, continued, into, the, early, middle, ages, the, movement, of,

east, and, north, africa, to, muslim, conquerors, in, the, 7th, century, although, the, carolingian, dynasty, of, the, franks, reunited, many, of, the, western, roman, lands, by, the, early, 9th, century, the, carolingian, empire, quickly, fell, apart, into, competing, kingdoms, which, later, fragmented, into, autonomous, duchies, and, lordships, during, the, high, middle, ages, which, began, after, 1000, the, population, of, europe, increased, greatly, as, the, medieval, warm, period, allowed, crop, yields, to, increase, and, technological, and, agricultural, innovations, introduced, a,

on, the, rise, by, the, end, of, the, period, the, settlement, of, western, european, peasants, and, aristocrats, towards, the, eastern, and, southern, peripheries, of, europe, often, spurred, by, crusades, led, to, the, expansion, of, latin, christendom, the, spread, of, cathedral, schools, and, universities, stimulated, a, new, method, of, intellectual, discussion, with, an, emphasis, on, rational, argumentation, known, as, scholasticism, mass, pilgrimages, prompted, the, construction, of, massive, romanesque, churches, while, structural, innovations, led, to, the, development, of, the, more, delicate, gothic, architecture, calamities, which, included, a, great, famine, and, the, black, death, which, reduced, the, population, by, 50, per, cent, began, the, late, middle, ages, in, the, 14th, century, conflicts, between, ethnic, and, social, groups, intensified, and, local, conflicts, often, escalated, into, full, scale, warfare, such, as, the, hundred, years, war, by, the,

centuries, old, war, against, their, muslim, neighbours, the, prominence, of, personal, faith, is, well, documented, but, the, western, schism, and, dissident, movements, condemned, as, heresies, presented, a, significant, challenge, to, traditional, power, structures, in, the, western, church, humanist, scholars, began, to, emphasise, human, dignity, and, early, renaissance, architects, and, artists, revived, several, elements, of, classical, culture, in, italy, during, the, last, medieval, century, naval, expeditions, in, search, for, new, trade, routes, introduced, the, age, of, discovery, the, middle, ages, is, the, second, of, the, three, major, periods, in, the, most, enduring, scheme, of, analysing, european, history, antiquity, the, middle, ages, and, the, modern, era, the, italian, leonardo, bruni, d, 1444, was, the, first, to, use, tripartite, periodisation, in, 1442, and, it, became, standard, with, the, german, historian, christoph, cellarius, d, 1707, the, adjective, medieval, pertaining, to, the, middle, ages, derives, from, medium, aevum, middle, age, a, neo, latin, term, first, recorded, in, 1604, it, is, also, spelt, mediaeval, or, medi, val, it, customarily, spans, the, period, between, c, 500, and, 1500, but, its, start, and, end, years, are, arbitrary, a, common, starting, point, first, used, by, bruni, is, 476, the, year, the, last, western, roman, emperor, was, deposed, as, an, alternative, the, conversion, of, the, roman, emperor, constantine, the, great, r, 306, 337, to, christianity, is, cited, there, is, no, universally, agreed, upon, end, date, the, most, frequently, used, dates, include, 1453, the, fall, of, constantinople, 1492, christopher, columbus, s, first, voyage, to, the, americas, and, 1517, the, beginning, of, the, protestant, reformation, europe, according, to, historian, miri, rubin, did, not, live, to, a, single, rhythm, over, this, period, christianisation, the, conversion, of, europe, to, christianity, took, place, in, waves, and, re, urbanisation, began, in, different, regions, at, different, times, scholarly, consensus, characterises, the, period, by, the, economic, predominance, of, agriculture, exploitation, of, the, peasantry, the, importance, of, interpersonal, relations, violence, patronage, kinship, and, charisma, in, power, structures, slow, inter, regional, communication, and, a, fragile, state, bureaucracy, historians, from, romance, language, speaking, countries, tend, to, divide, the, middle, ages, into, two, parts, early, high, and, late, low, english, speaking, historians, following, their, german, counterparts, generally, subdivide, the, period, into, thirds, early, high, and, late, during, the, 19th, century, the, middle, ages, were, often, known, as, the, dark, ages, with, the, adoption, of, the, three, subdivisions, in, the, early, 20th, century, however, use, of, that, term, was, restricted, to, the, early, middle, ages, historians, who, regard, the, middle, ages, as, a, eurocentric, concept, tend, to, avoid, its, use, in, global, history, although, studies, of, medieval, india, the, muslim, middle, ages, and, similar, subjects, are, not, uncommon, certain, aspects, of, medieval, society, including, the, lives, of, women, or, slaves, are, poorly, documented, which, limits, a, comprehensive, study, of, the, period, the, systematic, publication, of, medieval, written, sources, began, with, the, rerum, italicarum, scriptores, by, ludovico, muratori, d, 1750, which, was, followed, by, similar, series, such, as, the, monumenta, germaniae, historica, in, germany, and, the, rolls, series, in, the, united, kingdom, these, large, collections, primarily, contain, annals, chronicles, and, other, narrative, sources, focusing, on, the, deeds, of, powerful, men, professional, historians, treat, medieval, narratives, cautiously, since, they, are, often, filled, with, distorted, facts, or, unrealistic, information, documents, of, state, or, church, administration, such, as, royal, charters, and, chrysobulls, are, indispensable, sources, of, medieval, history, although, many, are, forged, other, written, sources, include, graffiti, seals, and, letters, since, the, 1950s, archaeology, has, significantly, contributed, to, studying, the, history, of, poorly, documented, regions, periods, and, groups, such, as, peasantry, chronological, dating, however, is, still, uncertain, legislation, may, influence, archaeological, research, new, finds, of, coins, and, hoards, are, frequently, exhibited, in, jurisdictions, with, liberal, regulation, such, as, england, and, wales, but, in, other, countries, such, as, italy, finds, from, unofficial, excavations, are, seldom, published, although, medieval, images, and, sculptures, may, provide, useful, information, about, everyday, life, a, critical, approach, is, necessary, irony, satire, and, anachronism, were, popular, stylistic, devices, of, medieval, artists, the, roman, empire, reached, its, greatest, territorial, extent, during, the, 2nd, century, ad, and, the, following, two, centuries, saw, the, slow, decline, of, roman, control, of, its, outlying, territories, runaway, inflation, external, pressure, on, the, frontiers, and, outbreaks, of, plague, combined, to, create, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, the, army, doubled, in, size, and, military, expenses, steadily, increased, primarily, in, response, to, the, war, with, the, sasanian, empire, the, need, for, revenue, led, to, increased, taxes, more, centralised, and, bureaucratic, state, administration, and, a, decline, in, numbers, of, the, curial, landowning, class, emperor, diocletian, r, 284, 305, split, the, empire, into, separately, administered, eastern, and, western, halves, in, 286, this, system, which, eventually, had, two, senior, and, two, junior, co, emperors, known, as, the, tetrarchy, stabilised, the, imperial, government, for, about, two, decades, after, a, period, of, civil, war, constantine, the, great, restored, internal, peace, and, re, founded, the, city, of, byzantium, as, the, eastern, capital, of, constantinople, in, 330, roman, society, stabilised, in, a, new, form, which, differed, from, the, earlier, classical, period, with, a, widening, gulf, between, rich, and, poor, and, a, decline, in, the, vitality, of, smaller, towns, another, change, was, the, christianisation, of, the, roman, empire, accelerated, by, the, conversion, of, constantine, although, christianity, emerged, as, the, empire, s, dominant, religion, only, at, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, debates, about, christian, theology, intensified, and, those, who, persisted, with, theological, views, condemned, at, the, ecumenical, councils, faced, persecution, heretical, views, survived, through, proselytising, campaigns, outside, the, empire, or, because, of, local, ethnic, group, support, examples, include, arianism, among, the, germanic, peoples, and, monophysitism, in, egypt, and, syria, judaism, remained, tolerated, although, legislation, limited, jewish, rights, the, early, christians, developed, their, own, symbolism, by, the, 3rd, century, often, by, reinterpreting, popular, motifs, of, pagan, roman, art, the, solemnity, of, later, roman, artists, abstract, style, effectively, visualised, christian, messages, and, christ, s, enthroned, figure, became, a, principal, element, of, early, christian, art, under, constantine, basilicas, large, halls, which, had, been, used, for, administrative, and, commercial, purposes, were, adapted, for, christian, worship, the, first, illuminated, manuscripts, hand, written, books, decorated, with, colourful, miniatures, were, produced, with, the, spread, of, silent, reading, in, the, 5th, century, civil, wars, between, rival, emperors, diverted, soldiers, from, the, empire, s, frontier, forces, allowing, invaders, to, encroach, beginning, in, the, mid, 4th, century, although, these, movements, of, peoples, have, been, described, as, invasions, they, were, often, not, just, military, expeditions, but, mass, migrations, into, the, empire, in, 376, hundreds, of, thousands, of, goths, fleeing, from, the, huns, received, permission, from, emperor, valens, r, 364, 78, to, settle, in, roman, territory, in, the, balkans, the, settlement, did, not, go, smoothly, and, when, roman, officials, mishandled, the, situation, the, goths, began, to, raid, and, plunder, valens, attempting, to, put, down, the, disorder, was, killed, fighting, the, goths, at, the, battle, of, adrianople, the, alans, vandals, and, suebi, crossed, into, gaul, in, 406, and, into, present, day, spain, in, 409, a, year, later, the, visigoths, a, gothic, group, sacked, the, city, of, rome, the, franks, alemanni, and, the, burgundians, ended, up, in, gaul, the, germanic, groups, now, collectively, known, as, anglo, saxons, settled, in, britain, and, the, vandals, conquered, the, province, of, africa, the, hunnic, king, attila, r, 434, 53, led, invasions, into, the, balkans, in, 442, and, 447, gaul, in, 451, and, italy, in, 452, but, his, hunnic, confederation, fell, apart, after, his, death, to, deal, with, the, migrations, the, eastern, roman, elites, combined, the, deployment, of, armed, forces, with, gifts, and, grants, of, offices, to, the, tribal, leaders, the, western, aristocrats, failed, to, support, the, army, and, refused, to, pay, tribute, to, prevent, invasions, by, the, tribes, these, invasions, led, to, the, division, of, the, western, part, of, the, empire, into, smaller, political, units, ruled, by, the, invading, tribes, the, 5th, century, emperors, were, often, controlled, by, military, strongmen, such, as, stilicho, d, 408, aetius, d, 454, ricimer, d, 472, or, odoacer, d, 493, who, were, partly, or, fully, non, roman, odoacer, deposed, romulus, augustulus, r, 475, 76, the, last, western, emperor, assumed, the, title, of, rex, king, and, took, full, control, of, italy, although, in, theory, he, ruled, as, a, representative, of, the, eastern, emperor, zeno, r, 474, 91, the, eastern, roman, empire, known, as, the, byzantine, empire, after, the, fall, of, its, western, counterpart, had, little, ability, to, control, the, lost, western, territories, but, its, emperors, maintained, a, claim, on, them, in, the, post, roman, world, the, fusion, of, roman, culture, with, the, customs, of, the, invading, tribes, is, well, documented, popular, assemblies, which, allowed, free, male, tribal, members, more, say, in, political, matters, than, had, been, common, in, the, roman, state, developed, into, legislative, and, judicial, bodies, much, of, the, scholarly, and, written, culture, of, the, new, political, entities, was, based, on, roman, intellectual, traditions, many, no, longer, supported, their, armies, through, taxes, instead, relying, on, granting, them, land, or, rent, with, less, need, for, large, tax, revenues, the, taxation, systems, declined, in, britain, the, celtic, britons, culture, had, little, impact, on, the, anglo, saxon, way, of, life, but, the, linguistic, assimilation, of, the, natives, to, the, newcomers, is, evident, by, c, 600, new, political, centres, emerged, some, local, leaders, accumulated, considerable, wealth, and, a, number, of, small, kingdoms, such, as, wessex, and, mercia, were, formed, smaller, kingdoms, in, present, day, wales, and, scotland, were, still, under, the, control, of, the, native, britons, and, picts, ireland, was, divided, into, even, smaller, political, units,

the, frankish, kingdom, expanded, and, converted, to, christianity, unlike, other, germanic, peoples, the, franks, preferred, mainstream, christianity, to, arianism, this, facilitated, their,

europe, the, eastern, roman, empire, remained, intact, and, experienced, an, economic, revival, which, lasted, into, the, early, 7th, century, political, life, was, marked, by, closer, relations, between, the, political, state, and, the, christian, church, with, theological, matters, assuming, an, importance, in, eastern, politics, that, they, did, not, have, in, western, europe, legal, developments, included, the, codification, of, roman, law, the, most, comprehensive, compilation, the, corpus, juris, civilis, was, made, under, emperor, justinian, r, 527, 65, the, byzantines, regularly, employed, eunuchs, for, administrative, tasks, or, as, guardians, or, tutors, of, women, and, children, since, they, considered, castrated, men, exceptionally, intelligent, and, loyal, servants, justinian, nearly, died, during, the, nika, riots, a, popular, revolt, that, destroyed, half, of, constantinople, in, 532, after, crushing, the, revolt, he, reinforced, the, autocratic, elements, of, the, imperial, government, and, mobilised, his, troops, against, the, western, arian, kingdoms, the, general, belisarius, d, 565, seized, north, africa, from, the, vandals, and, attacked, the, ostrogoths, but, his, campaign, was, interrupted, by, an, unexpected, sasanian, invasion, from, the, east, between, 541, and, 543, a, deadly, outbreak, of, plague, decimated, the, empire, justinian, developed, an, extensive, system, of, border, forts, to, compensate, for, the, lack, of, military, personnel, but, stopped, maintaining, the, public, roads, he, resumed, his, expansionism, in, a, decade, completing, the, conquest, of, the, ostrogothic, kingdom, and, seizing, much, of, southern, spain, from, the, visigoths, justinian, s, re, conquests, and, building, program, have, been, criticised, by, historians, for, bringing, his, realm, to, the, brink, of, bankruptcy, but, many, of, the, difficulties, faced, by, his, successors, were, due, to, other, factors, including, the, massive, expansion, of, the, avars, and, their, slav, allies, eastern, border, defences, collapsed, during, a, new, war, with, the, sasanian, empire, and, the, persians, seized, egypt,

scholarship, and, education, largely, disappeared, although, literacy, remained, important, it, became, a, practical, skill, rather, than, an, indication, of, status, by, the, late, 6th, century, the, principal, means, of, religious, instruction, were, music, and, art, rather, than, books, most, intellectual, efforts, imitated, classical, scholarship, but, some, original, works, were, also, created, the, writings, of, sidonius, apollinaris, d, 489, cassiodorus, d, c, 585, and, boethius, d, c, 525, were, typical, of, the, age, aristocratic, culture, focused, on, great, feasts, rather, than, literary, pursuits, family, ties, among, the, elites, were, important, as, were, the, virtues, of, loyalty, courage, and, honour, these, ties, led, to, the, prevalence, of, feuds, in, aristocratic, society, most, feuds, seem, to, have, ended, quickly, with, the, payment, of, compensation, women, participated, in, aristocratic, society, primarily, as, wives, and, mothers, with, the, mother, of, an, underage, ruler, especially, prominent, in, francia, the, lack, of, many, child, rulers, in, anglo, saxon, society, meant, a, lesser, role, for, women, as, queen, mothers, but, this, was, countered, by, the, increased, role, played, by, abbesses, of, monasteries, women, s, influence, on, politics, was, fragile, and, early, medieval, authors, tended, to, depict, powerful, women,

command, ships, women, usually, died, at, a, considerably, younger, age, than, men, primarily, due, to, complications, at, childbirth, the, disparity, in, numbers, between, marriageable, women, and, men, led, to, the, detailed, regulation, of, legal, institutions, protecting, women, s, interests, including, their, right, to, the, morgengabe, morning, gift, early, medieval, laws, acknowledged, a, man, s, right, to, have, long, term, sexual, relationships, with, women, other, than, his, wife, such, as, concubines, but, women, were, expected, to, remain, faithful, clerics, censured, sexual, unions, outside, marriage, and, monogamy, also, became, the, norm, of, secular, law, in, the, 9th, century, landholding, patterns, were, not, uniform, some, areas, had, greatly, fragmented, holdings, but, large, contiguous, blocks, of, land, were, the, norm, in, other, areas, these, differences, permitted, a, wide, variety, of, peasant, societies, some, dominated, by, aristocratic, landholders, and, others, with, a, great, deal, of, autonomy, land, settlement, also, varied, greatly, some, peasants, lived, in, large, settlements, with, as, many, as, 700, inhabitants, and, others, on, isolated, farms, since, legislation, made, a, clear, distinction, between, free, and, unfree, there, was, no, sharp, difference, between, the, legal, status, of, the, free, peasant, and, the,
