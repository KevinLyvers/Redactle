years, ago, sedentariness, began, in, south, asia, around, 7000, bce, by, 4500, bce, settled, life, had, spread, and, gradually, evolved, into, the, indus, valley, civilisation, which, flourished, between, 2500, bce, and, 1900, bce, in, present, day, pakistan, and, north, western, india, early, in, the, second, millennium, bce, persistent, drought, caused, the, population, of, the, indus, valley, to, scatter, from, large, urban, centres, to, villages, indo, aryan, tribes, moved, into, the, punjab, from, central, asia, in, several, waves, of, migration, the, vedic, period, of, the, vedic, people, in, northern, india, 1500, 500, bce, was, marked, by, the, composition, of, their, extensive, collections, of, hymns, vedas, the, social, structure, was, loosely, stratified, via, the, varna, system, incorporated, into, the, highly, evolved, present, day, j, ti, system, the, pastoral, and, nomadic, indo, aryans, spread, from, the, punjab, into, the, gangetic, plain, around, 600, bce, a, new, interregional, culture, arose, then, small, chieftaincies, janapadas, were, consolidated, into, larger, states, mahajanapadas, second, urbanization, took, place, which, came, with, the, rise, of, new, ascetic, movements, and, religious, concepts, including, the, rise, of, jainism, and, buddhism, the, latter, was, synthesized, with, the, preexisting, religious, cultures, of, the, subcontinent, giving, rise, to, hinduism, chandragupta, maurya, overthrew, the, nanda, empire, and, established, the, first, great, empire, in, ancient, india, the, maurya, empire, india, s, mauryan, king, ashoka, is, widely, recognised, for, his, historical, acceptance, of, buddhism, and, his, attempts, to, spread, nonviolence, and, peace, across, his, empire, the, maurya, empire, would, collapse, in, 185, bce, on, the, assassination, of, the, then, emperor, brihadratha, by, his, general, pushyamitra, shunga, shunga, would, form, the, shunga, empire, in, the, north, and, north, east, of, the, subcontinent, while, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, would, claim, the, north, west, and, found, the, indo, greek, kingdom, various, parts, of, india, were, ruled, by, numerous, dynasties, including, the, gupta, empire, in, the, 4th, to, 6th, centuries, ce, this, period, witnessing, a, hindu, religious, and, intellectual, resurgence, is, known, as, the, classical, or, golden, age, of, india, aspects, of, indian, civilisation, administration, culture, and, religion, spread, to, much, of, asia, which, led, to, the, establishment, of, indianised, kingdoms, in, the, region, forming, greater, india, the, most, significant, event, between, the, 7th, and, 11th, centuries, was, the, tripartite, struggle, centred, on, kannauj, southern, india, saw, the, rise, of, multiple, imperial, powers, from, the, middle, of, the, fifth, century, the, chola, dynasty, conquered, southern, india, in, the, 11th, century, in, the, early, medieval, period, indian, mathematics, including, hindu, numerals, influenced, the, development, of, mathematics, and, astronomy, in, the, arab, world, including, the, creation, of, the, hindu, arabic, numeral, system, islamic, conquests, made, limited, inroads, into, modern, afghanistan, and, sindh, as, early, as, the, 8th, century, followed, by, the, invasions, of, mahmud, ghazni, the, delhi, sultanate, was, founded, in, 1206, by, central, asian, turks, who, were, indianized, they, ruled, a, major, part, of, the, northern, indian, subcontinent, in, the, early, 14th, century, it, was, ruled, by, multiple, turk, afghan, and, indian, dynasties, including, the, turco, mongol, indianized, tughlaq, dynasty, but, declined, in, the, late, 14th, century, following, the, invasions, of, timur, and, saw, the, advent, of, the, malwa, gujarat, and, bahmani, sultanates, the, last, of, which, split, in, 1518, into, the, five, deccan, sultanates, the, wealthy, bengal, sultanate, also, emerged, as, a, major, power, lasting, over, three, centuries, during, this, period, multiple, strong, hindu, kingdoms, notably, the, vijayanagara, empire, and, the, rajput, states, emerged, and, played, significant, roles, in, shaping, the, cultural, and, political, landscape, of, india, the, early, modern, period, began, in, the, 16th, century, when, the, mughal, empire, conquered, most, of, the, indian, subcontinent, signaling, the, proto, industrialisation, becoming, the, biggest, global, economy, and, manufacturing, power, the, mughals, suffered, a, gradual, decline, in, the, early, 18th, century, largely, due, to, the, rising, power, of, the, marathas, who, took, control, of, extensive, regions, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, east, india, company, acting, as, a, sovereign, force, on, behalf, of, the, british, government, gradually, acquired, control, of, huge, areas, of, india, between, the, middle, of, the, 18th, and, the, middle, of, the, 19th, centuries, policies, of, company, rule, in, india, led, to, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, india, was, afterwards, ruled, directly, by, the, british, crown, in, the, british, raj, after, world, war, i, a, nationwide, struggle, for, independence, was, launched, by, the, indian, national, congress, led, by, mahatma, gandhi, later, the, all, india, muslim, league, would, advocate, for, a, separate, muslim, majority, nation, state, the, british, indian, empire, was, partitioned, in, august, 1947, into, the, dominion, of, india, and, dominion, of, pakistan, each, gaining, its, independence, hominin, expansion, from, africa, is, estimated, to, have, reached, the, indian, subcontinent, approximately, two, million, years, ago, and, possibly, as, early, as, 2, 2, million, years, ago, this, dating, is, based, on, the, known, presence, of, homo, erectus, in, indonesia, by, 1, 8, million, years, ago, and, in, east, asia, by, 1, 36, million, years, ago, as, well, as, the, discovery, of, stone, tools, at, riwat, in, pakistan, although, some, older, discoveries, have, been, claimed, the, suggested, dates, based, on, the, dating, of, fluvial, sediments, have, not, been, independently, verified, the, oldest, hominin, fossil, remains, in, the, indian, subcontinent, are, those, of, homo, erectus, or, homo, heidelbergensis, from, the, narmada, valley, in, central, india, and, are, dated, to, approximately, half, a, million, years, ago, older, fossil, finds, have, been, claimed, but, are, considered, unreliable, reviews, of, archaeological, evidence, have, suggested, that, occupation, of, the, indian, subcontinent, by, hominins, was, sporadic, until, approximately, 700, 000, years, ago, and, was, geographically, widespread, by, approximately, 250, 000, years, ago, according, to, a, historical, demographer, of, south, asia, tim, dyson, modern, human, beings, homo, sapiens, originated, in, africa, then, intermittently, sometime, between, 60, 000, and, 80, 000, years, ago, tiny, groups, of, them, began, to, enter, the, north, west, of, the, indian, subcontinent, it, seems, likely, that, initially, they, came, by, way, of, the, coast, it, is, virtually, certain, that, there, were, homo, sapiens, in, the, subcontinent, 55, 000, years, ago, even, though, the, earliest, fossils, that, have, been, found, of, them, date, to, only, about, 30, 000, years, before, the, present, according, to, michael, d, petraglia, and, bridget, allchin, y, chromosome, and, mt, dna, data, support, the, colonisation, of, south, asia, by, modern, humans, originating, in, africa, coalescence, dates, for, most, non, european, populations, average, to, between, 73, 55, ka, historian, of, south, asia, michael, h, fisher, states, scholars, estimate, that, the, first, successful, expansion, of, the, homo, sapiens, range, beyond, africa, and, across, the, arabian, peninsula, occurred, from, as, early, as, 80, 000, years, ago, to, as, late, as, 40, 000, years, ago, although, there, may, have, been, prior, unsuccessful, emigrations, some, of, their, descendants, extended, the, human, range, ever, further, in, each, generation, spreading, into, each, habitable, land, they, encountered, one, human, channel, was, along, the, warm, and, productive, coastal, lands, of, the, persian, gulf, and, northern, indian, ocean, eventually, various, bands, entered, india, between, 75, 000, years, ago, and, 35, 000, years, ago, archaeological, evidence, has, been, interpreted, to, suggest, the, presence, of, anatomically, modern, humans, in, the, indian, subcontinent, 78, 000, 74, 000, years, ago, although, this, interpretation, is, disputed, the, occupation, of, south, asia, by, modern, humans, initially, in, varying, forms, of, isolation, as, hunter, gatherers, has, turned, it, into, a, highly, diverse, one, second, only, to, africa, in, human, genetic, diversity, according, to, tim, dyson, genetic, research, has, contributed, to, knowledge, of, the, prehistory, of, the, subcontinent, s, people, in, other, respects, in, particular, the, level, of, genetic, diversity, in, the, region, is, extremely, high, indeed, only, africa, s, population, is, genetically, more, diverse, related, to, this, there, is, strong, evidence, of, founder, events, in, the, subcontinent, by, this, is, meant, circumstances, where, a, subgroup, such, as, a, tribe, derives, from, a, tiny, number, of, original, individuals, further, compared, to, most, world, regions, the, subcontinent, s, people, are, relatively, distinct, in, having, practised, comparatively, high, levels, of, endogamy, settled, life, emerged, on, the, subcontinent, in, the, western, margins, of, the, indus, river, alluvium, approximately, 9, 000, years, ago, evolving, gradually, into, the, indus, valley, civilisation, of, the, third, millennium, bce, according, to, tim, dyson, by, 7, 000, years, ago, agriculture, was, firmly, established, in, baluchistan, slowly, spread, eastwards, into, the, indus, valley, michael, fisher, adds, the, earliest, discovered, instance, of, well, established, settled, agricultural, society, is, at, mehrgarh, in, the, hills, between, the, bolan, pass, and, the, indus, plain, today, in, pakistan, see, map, 3, 1, from, as, early, as, 7000, bce, communities, there, started, investing, increased, labor, in, preparing, the, land, and, selecting, planting, tending, and, harvesting, particular, grain, producing, plants, they, also, domesticated, animals, including, sheep, goats, pigs, and, oxen, both, humped, zebu, and, unhumped, castrating, oxen, for, instance, turned, them, from, mainly, meat, sources, into, domesticated, draft, animals, as, well, the, bronze, age, in, the, indian, subcontinent, began, around, 3300, bce, the, indus, valley, region, was, one, of, three, early, cradles, of, civilisation, in, the, old, world, the, indus, valley, civilisation, was, the, most, expansive, and, at, its, peak, may, have, had, a, population, of, over, five, million, the, civilisation, was, primarily, centred, in, modern, day, pakistan, in, the, indus, river, basin, and, secondarily, in, the, ghaggar, hakra, river, basin, the, mature, indus, civilisation, flourished, from, about, 2600, to, 1900, bce, marking, the, beginning, of, urban, civilisation, on, the, indian, subcontinent, it, included, cities, such, as, harappa, ganweriwal, and, mohenjo, daro, in, modern, day, pakistan, and, dholavira, kalibangan, rakhigarhi, and, lothal, in, modern, day, india, inhabitants, of, the, ancient, indus, river, valley, the, harappans, developed, new, techniques, in, metallurgy, and, handicraft, and, produced, copper, bronze, lead, and, tin, the, civilisation, is, noted, for, its, cities, built, of, brick, and, its, roadside, drainage, system, and, is, thought, to, have, had, some, kind, of, municipal, organisation, the, civilisation, also, developed, an, indus, script, the, earliest, of, the, ancient, indian, scripts, which, is, presently, undeciphered, this, is, the, reason, why, harappan, language, is, not, directly, attested, and, its, affiliation, uncertain, after, the, collapse, of, indus, valley, civilisation, the, inhabitants, migrated, from, the, river, valleys, of, indus, and, ghaggar, hakra, towards, the, himalayan, foothills, of, ganga, yamuna, basin, during, 2nd, millennium, bce, ochre, coloured, pottery, culture, was, in, ganga, yamuna, doab, region, these, were, rural, settlements, with, agriculture, and, hunting, they, were, using, copper, tools, such, as, axes, spears, arrows, and, swords, and, had, domesticated, animals, starting, c, 1900, bce, indo, aryan, tribes, moved, into, the, punjab, from, central, asia, in, several, waves, of, migration, the, vedic, period, is, when, the, vedas, were, composed, of, liturgical, hymns, from, the, indo, aryan, people, the, vedic, culture, was, located, in, part, of, north, west, india, while, other, parts, of, india, had, a, distinct, cultural, identity, many, regions, of, the, indian, subcontinent, transitioned, from, the, chalcolithic, to, the, iron, age, in, this, period, the, vedic, culture, is, described, in, the, texts, of, vedas, still, sacred, to, hindus, which, were, orally, composed, and, transmitted, in, vedic, sanskrit, the, vedas, are, some, of, the, oldest, extant, texts, in, india, the, vedic, period, lasting, from, about, 1500, to, 500, bce, contributed, the, foundations, of, several, cultural, aspects, of, the, indian, subcontinent, historians, have, analysed, the, vedas, to, posit, a, vedic, culture, in, the, punjab, and, the, upper, gangetic, plain, the, peepal, tree, and, cow, were, sanctified, by, the, time, of, the, atharva, veda, many, of, the, concepts, of, indian, philosophy, espoused, later, like, dharma, trace, their, roots, to, vedic, antecedents, early, vedic, society, is, described, in, the, rigveda, the, oldest, vedic, text, believed, to, have, been, compiled, during, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, in, the, north, western, region, of, the, indian, subcontinent, at, this, time, aryan, society, consisted, of, predominantly, tribal, and, pastoral, groups, distinct, from, the, harappan, urbanisation, which, had, been, abandoned, the, early, indo, aryan, presence, probably, corresponds, in, part, to, the, ochre, coloured, pottery, culture, in, archaeological, contexts, at, the, end, of, the, rigvedic, period, the, aryan, society, expanded, from, the, north, western, region, of, the, indian, subcontinent, into, the, western, ganges, plain, it, became, increasingly, agricultural, and, was, socially, organised, around, the, hierarchy, of, the, four, varnas, or, social, classes, this, social, structure, was, characterised, both, by, syncretising, with, the, native, cultures, of, northern, india, but, also, eventually, by, the, excluding, of, some, indigenous, peoples, by, labelling, their, occupations, impure, during, this, period, many, of, the, previous, small, tribal, units, and, chiefdoms, began, to, coalesce, into, janapadas, monarchical, state, level, polities, the, sanskrit, epics, ramayana, and, mahabharata, were, composed, during, this, period, the, mahabharata, remains, the, longest, single, poem, in, the, world, historians, formerly, postulated, an, epic, age, as, the, milieu, of, these, two, epic, poems, but, now, recognise, that, the, texts, went, through, multiple, stages, of, development, over, centuries, the, existing, texts, of, these, epics, are, believed, to, belong, to, the, post, vedic, age, between, c, 400, bce, and, 400, ce, the, iron, age, in, the, indian, subcontinent, from, about, 1200, bce, to, the, 6th, century, bce, is, defined, by, the, rise, of, janapadas, which, are, realms, republics, and, kingdoms, notably, the, iron, age, kingdoms, of, kuru, panchala, kosala, and, videha, the, kuru, kingdom, c, 1200, 450, bce, was, the, first, state, level, society, of, the, vedic, period, corresponding, to, the, beginning, of, the, iron, age, in, north, western, india, around, 1200, 800, bce, as, well, as, with, the, composition, of, the, atharvaveda, the, kuru, state, organised, the, vedic, hymns, into, collections, and, developed, the, srauta, ritual, to, uphold, the, social, order, two, key, figures, of, the, kuru, state, were, king, parikshit, and, his, successor, janamejaya, who, transformed, this, realm, into, the, dominant, political, social, and, cultural, power, of, northern, india, when, the, kuru, kingdom, declined, the, centre, of, vedic, culture, shifted, to, their, eastern, neighbours, the, panchala, kingdom, the, archaeological, pgw, painted, grey, ware, culture, which, flourished, in, north, eastern, india, s, haryana, and, western, uttar, pradesh, regions, from, about, 1100, to, 600, bce, is, believed, to, correspond, to, the, kuru, and, panchala, kingdoms, during, the, late, vedic, period, the, kingdom, of, videha, emerged, as, a, new, centre, of, vedic, culture, situated, even, farther, to, the, east, in, what, is, today, nepal, and, bihar, state, reaching, its, prominence, under, the, king, janaka, whose, court, provided, patronage, for, brahmin, sages, and, philosophers, such, as, yajnavalkya, aruni, and, g, rg, v, chaknav, the, later, part, of, this, period, corresponds, with, a, consolidation, of, increasingly, large, states, and, kingdoms, called, mahajanapadas, across, northern, india, the, period, between, 800, and, 200, bce, saw, the, formation, of, the, rama, a, movement, from, which, jainism, and, buddhism, originated, the, first, upanishads, were, written, during, this, period, after, 500, bce, the, so, called, second, urbanisation, started, with, new, urban, settlements, arising, at, the, ganges, plain, the, foundations, for, the, second, urbanisation, were, laid, prior, to, 600, bce, in, the, painted, grey, ware, culture, of, the, ghaggar, hakra, and, upper, ganges, plain, although, most, pgw, sites, were, small, farming, villages, several, dozen, pgw, sites, eventually, emerged, as, relatively, large, settlements, that, can, be, characterised, as, towns, the, largest, of, which, were, fortified, by, ditches, or, moats, and, embankments, made, of, piled, earth, with, wooden, palisades, the, central, ganges, plain, where, magadha, gained, prominence, forming, the, base, of, the, maurya, empire, was, a, distinct, cultural, area, with, new, states, arising, after, 500, bce, it, was, influenced, by, the, vedic, culture, but, differed, markedly, from, the, kuru, panchala, region, it, was, the, area, of, the, earliest, known, cultivation, of, rice, in, south, asia, and, by, 1800, bce, was, the, location, of, an, advanced, neolithic, population, associated, with, the, sites, of, chirand, and, chechar, in, this, region, the, rama, ic, movements, flourished, and, jainism, and, buddhism, originated, the, time, between, 800, bce, and, 400, bce, witnessed, the, composition, of, the, earliest, upanishads, which, form, the, theoretical, basis, of, classical, hinduism, and, are, also, known, as, the, vedanta, conclusion, of, the, vedas, the, increasing, urbanisation, of, india, in, the, 7th, and, 6th, centuries, bce, led, to, the, rise, of, new, ascetic, or, rama, a, movements, which, challenged, the, orthodoxy, of, rituals, mahavira, c, 599, 527, bce, proponent, of, jainism, and, gautama, buddha, c, 563, 483, bce, founder, of, buddhism, were, the, most, prominent, icons, of, this, movement, rama, a, gave, rise, to, the, concept, of, the, cycle, of, birth, and, death, the, concept, of, samsara, and, the, concept, of, liberation, buddha, found, a, middle, way, that, ameliorated, the, extreme, asceticism, found, in, the, rama, a, religions, around, the, same, time, mahavira, the, 24th, tirthankara, in, jainism, propagated, a, theology, that, was, to, later, become, jainism, however, jain, orthodoxy, believes, the, teachings, of, the, tirthankaras, predates, all, known, time, and, scholars, believe, parshvanatha, c, 872, c, 772, bce, accorded, status, as, the, 23rd, tirthankara, was, a, historical, figure, the, vedas, are, believed, to, have, documented, a, few, tirthankaras, and, an, ascetic, order, similar, to, the, rama, a, movement, the, period, from, c, 600, bce, to, c, 300, bce, witnessed, the, rise, of, the, mahajanapadas, sixteen, powerful, and, vast, kingdoms, and, oligarchic, republics, these, mahajanapadas, evolved, and, flourished, in, a, belt, stretching, from, gandhara, in, the, north, west, to, bengal, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, indian, subcontinent, and, included, parts, of, the, trans, vindhyan, region, ancient, buddhist, texts, like, the, a, guttara, nik, ya, make, frequent, reference, to, these, sixteen, great, kingdoms, and,

came, to, comprise, british, india, the, annexed, regions, included, the, north, western, provinces, comprising, rohilkhand, gorakhpur, and, the, doab, 1801, delhi, 1803, assam, ahom, kingdom, 1828,

with, the, state, of, oudh, two, years, later, the, second, form, of, asserting, power, involved, treaties, in, which, indian, rulers, acknowledged, the, company, s, hegemony, in, return, for, limited, internal, autonomy, since, the, company, operated, under, financial, constraints, it, had, to, set, up, political, underpinnings, for, its, rule, the, most, important, such, support, came, from, the, subsidiary, alliances, with, indian, princes, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, territories, of, these, princes, accounted, for, two, thirds, of, india, when, an, indian, ruler, who, was, able, to, secure, his, territory, wanted, to, enter, such, an, alliance, the, company, welcomed, it, as, an, economical, method, of, indirect, rule, that, did, not, involve, the, economic, costs, of, direct, administration, or, the, political, costs, of, gaining, the, support, of, alien, subjects, in, return, the, company, undertook, the, defense, of, these, subordinate, allies, and, treated, them, with, traditional, respect, and, marks, of, honor, subsidiary, alliances, created, the, princely, states, of, the, hindu, maharajas, and, the, muslim, nawabs, prominent, among, the, princely, states, were, cochin, 1791, jaipur, 1794, travancore, 1795, hyderabad, 1798, mysore, 1799, cis, sutlej, hill, states, 1815, central, india, agency, 1819, cutch, and, gujarat, gaikwad, territories,

to, colonies, of, european, powers, to, provide, labour, for, the, mainly, sugar, plantations, it, started, from, the, end, of, slavery, in, 1833, and, continued, until, 1920, this, resulted, in, the, development, of, a, large, indian, diaspora, that, spread, from, the, caribbean, to, the, pacific, ocean, and, the, growth, of, large, indo, caribbean, and, indo, african, populations, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, was, a, large, scale, rebellion, by, soldiers, employed, by, the, british, east, india, company, in, northern, and, central, india, against, the, company, s, rule, the, spark, that, led, to, the, mutiny, was, the, issue, of, new, gunpowder, cartridges, for, the, enfield, rifle, which, was, insensitive, to, local, religious, prohibition, the, key, mutineer, was, mangal, pandey, in, addition, the, underlying, grievances, over, british, taxation, the, ethnic, gulf, between, the, british, officers, and, their, indian, troops, and, land, annexations, played, a, significant, role, in, the, rebellion, within, weeks, after, pandey, s, mutiny, dozens, of, units, of, the, indian, army, joined, peasant, armies, in, widespread, rebellion, the, rebel, soldiers, were, later, joined, by, indian, nobility, many, of, whom, had, lost, titles, and, domains, under, the, doctrine, of, lapse, and, felt, that, the, company, had, interfered, with, a, traditional, system, of, inheritance, rebel, leaders, such, as, nana, sahib, and, the, rani, of, jhansi, belonged, to, this, group, after, the, outbreak, of, the, mutiny, in, meerut, the, rebels, very, quickly, reached, delhi, the, rebels, had, also, captured, large, tracts, of, the, north, western, provinces, and, awadh, oudh, most, notably, in, awadh, the, rebellion, took, on, the, attributes, of, a, patriotic, revolt, against, british, presence, however, the, british, east, india, company, mobilised, rapidly, with, the, assistance, of, friendly, princely, states, but, it, took, the, british, the, better, part, of, 1858, to, suppress, the, rebellion, due, to, the, rebels, being, poorly, equipped, and, having, no, outside, support, or, funding, they, were, brutally, subdued, in, the, aftermath, all, power, was, transferred, from, the, british, east, india, company, to, the, british, crown, which, began, to, administer, most, of, india, as, provinces, the, crown, controlled, the, company, s, lands, directly, and, had, considerable, indirect, influence, over, the, rest, of, india, which, consisted, of, the, princely, states, ruled, by, local, royal, families, there, were, officially, 565,

some, 60, 000, indians, had, matriculated, the, indian, economy, grew, at, about, 1, per, year, from, 1880, to, 1920, and, the, population, also, grew, at, 1, however, from, 1910s, indian, private, industry, began, to, grow, significantly, india, built, a, modern, railway, system, in, the, late, 19th, century, which, was, the, fourth, largest, in, the, world, historians, have, been, divided, on, issues, of, economic, history, with, the, nationalist, school, arguing, that, india, was, poorer, due, to, british, rule, in, 1905, lord, curzon, split, the, large, province, of, bengal, into, a, largely, hindu, western, half, and, eastern, bengal, and, assam, a, largely, muslim, eastern, half, the, british, goal, was, said, to, be, efficient, administration, but, the, people, of, bengal,
