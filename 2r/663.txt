https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware
the, history, of, computing, hardware, covers, the, developments, from, early, simple, devices, to, aid, calculation, to, modern, day, computers, the, first, aids, to, computation, were, purely, mechanical, devices, which, required, the, operator, to, set, up, the, initial, values, of, an, elementary, arithmetic, operation, then, manipulate, the, device, to, obtain, the, result, later, computers, represented, numbers, in, a, continuous, form, e, g, distance, along, a, scale, rotation, of, a, shaft, or, a, voltage, numbers, could, also, be, represented, in, the, form, of, digits, automatically, manipulated, by, a, mechanism, although, this, approach, generally, required, more, complex, mechanisms, it, greatly, increased, the, precision, of, results, the, development, of, transistor, technology, and, then, the, integrated, circuit, chip, led, to, a, series, of, breakthroughs, starting, with, transistor, computers, and, then, integrated, circuit, computers, causing, digital, computers, to, largely, replace, analog, computers, metal, oxide, semiconductor, mos, large, scale, integration, lsi, then, enabled, semiconductor, memory, and, the, microprocessor, leading, to, another, key, breakthrough, the, miniaturized, personal, computer, pc, in, the, 1970s, the, cost, of, computers, gradually, became, so, low, that, personal, computers, by, the, 1990s, and, then, mobile, computers, smartphones, and, tablets, in, the, 2000s, became, ubiquitous, devices, have, been, used, to, aid, computation, for, thousands, of, years, mostly, using, one, to, one, correspondence, with, fingers, the, earliest, counting, device, was, probably, a, form, of, tally, stick, the, lebombo, bone, from, the, mountains, between, eswatini, and, south, africa, may, be, the, oldest, known, mathematical, artifact, it, dates, from, 35, 000, bce, and, consists, of, 29, distinct, notches, that, were, deliberately, cut, into, a, baboon, s, fibula, later, record, keeping, aids, throughout, the, fertile, crescent, included, calculi, clay, spheres, cones, etc, which, represented, counts, of, items, probably, livestock, or, grains, sealed, in, hollow, unbaked, clay, containers, the, use, of, counting, rods, is, one, example, the, abacus, was, early, used, for, arithmetic, tasks, what, we, now, call, the, roman, abacus, was, used, in, babylonia, as, early, as, c, 2700, 2300, bc, since, then, many, other, forms, of, reckoning, boards, or, tables, have, been, invented, in, a, medieval, european, counting, house, a, checkered, cloth, would, be, placed, on, a, table, and, markers, moved, around, on, it, according, to, certain, rules, as, an, aid, to, calculating, sums, of, money, several, analog, computers, were, constructed, in, ancient, and, medieval, times, to, perform, astronomical, calculations, these, included, the, astrolabe, and, antikythera, mechanism, from, the, hellenistic, world, c, 150, 100, bc, in, roman, egypt, hero, of, alexandria, c, 10, 70, ad, made, mechanical, devices, including, automata, and, a, programmable, cart, the, steam, powered, automatic, flute, described, by, the, book, of, ingenious, devices, 850, by, the, persian, baghdadi, ban, m, s, brothers, may, have, been, the, first, programmable, device, other, early, mechanical, devices, used, to, perform, one, or, another, type, of, calculations, include, the, planisphere, and, other, mechanical, computing, devices, invented, by, al, biruni, c, ad, 1000, the, equatorium, and, universal, latitude, independent, astrolabe, by, al, zarqali, c, ad, 1015, the, astronomical, analog, computers, of, other, medieval, muslim, astronomers, and, engineers, and, the, astronomical, clock, tower, of, su, song, 1094, during, the, song, dynasty, the, castle, clock, a, hydropowered, mechanical, astronomical, clock, invented, by, ismail, al, jazari, in, 1206, was, the, first, programmable, analog, computer, ramon, llull, invented, the, lullian, circle, a, notional, machine, for, calculating, answers, to, philosophical, questions, in, this, case, to, do, with, christianity, via, logical, combinatorics, this, idea, was, taken, up, by, leibniz, centuries, later, and, is, thus, one, of, the, founding, elements, in, computing, and, information, science, scottish, mathematician, and, physicist, john, napier, discovered, that, the, multiplication, and, division, of, numbers, could, be, performed, by, the, addition, and, subtraction, respectively, of, the, logarithms, of, those, numbers, while, producing, the, first, logarithmic, tables, napier, needed, to, perform, many, tedious, multiplications, it, was, at, this, point, that, he, designed, his, napier, s, bones, an, abacus, like, device, that, greatly, simplified, calculations, that, involved, multiplication, and, division, since, real, numbers, can, be, represented, as, distances, or, intervals, on, a, line, the, slide, rule, was, invented, in, the, 1620s, shortly, after, napier, s, work, to, allow, multiplication, and, division, operations, to, be, carried, out, significantly, faster, than, was, previously, possible, edmund, gunter, built, a, calculating, device, with, a, single, logarithmic, scale, at, the, university, of, oxford, his, device, greatly, simplified, arithmetic, calculations, including, multiplication, and, division, william, oughtred, greatly, improved, this, in, 1630, with, his, circular, slide, rule, he, followed, this, up, with, the, modern, slide, rule, in, 1632, essentially, a, combination, of, two, gunter, rules, held, together, with, the, hands, slide, rules, were, used, by, generations, of, engineers, and, other, mathematically, involved, professional, workers, until, the, invention, of, the, pocket, calculator, in, 1609, guidobaldo, del, monte, made, a, mechanical, multiplier, to, calculate, fractions, of, a, degree, based, on, a, system, of, four, gears, the, rotation, of, an, index, on, one, quadrant, corresponds, to, 60, rotations, of, another, index, on, an, opposite, quadrant, thanks, to, this, machine, errors, in, the, calculation, of, first, second, third, and, quarter, degrees, can, be, avoided, guidobaldo, is, the, first, to, document, the, use, of, gears, for, mechanical, calculation, wilhelm, schickard, a, german, polymath, designed, a, calculating, machine, in, 1623, which, combined, a, mechanized, form, of, napier, s, rods, with, the, world, s, first, mechanical, adding, machine, built, into, the, base, because, it, made, use, of, a, single, tooth, gear, there, were, circumstances, in, which, its, carry, mechanism, would, jam, a, fire, destroyed, at, least, one, of, the, machines, in, 1624, and, it, is, believed, schickard, was, too, disheartened, to, build, another, in, 1642, while, still, a, teenager, blaise, pascal, started, some, pioneering, work, on, calculating, machines, and, after, three, years, of, effort, and, 50, prototypes, he, invented, a, mechanical, calculator, he, built, twenty, of, these, machines, called, pascal, s, calculator, or, pascaline, in, the, following, ten, years, nine, pascalines, have, survived, most, of, which, are, on, display, in, european, museums, a, continuing, debate, exists, over, whether, schickard, or, pascal, should, be, regarded, as, the, inventor, of, the, mechanical, calculator, and, the, range, of, issues, to, be, considered, is, discussed, elsewhere, gottfried, wilhelm, von, leibniz, invented, the, stepped, reckoner, and, his, famous, stepped, drum, mechanism, around, 1672, he, attempted, to, create, a, machine, that, could, be, used, not, only, for, addition, and, subtraction, but, would, use, a, moveable, carriage, to, enable, multiplication, and, division, leibniz, once, said, it, is, unworthy, of, excellent, men, to, lose, hours, like, slaves, in, the, labour, of, calculation, which, could, safely, be, relegated, to, anyone, else, if, machines, were, used, however, leibniz, did, not, incorporate, a, fully, successful, carry, mechanism, leibniz, also, described, the, binary, numeral, system, a, central, ingredient, of, all, modern, computers, however, up, to, the, 1940s, many, subsequent, designs, including, charles, babbage, s, machines, of, 1822, and, even, eniac, of, 1945, were, based, on, the, decimal, system, around, 1820, charles, xavier, thomas, de, colmar, created, what, would, over, the, rest, of, the, century, become, the, first, successful, mass, produced, mechanical, calculator, the, thomas, arithmometer, it, could, be, used, to, add, and, subtract, and, with, a, moveable, carriage, the, operator, could, also, multiply, and, divide, by, a, process, of, long, multiplication, and, long, division, it, utilised, a, stepped, drum, similar, in, conception, to, that, invented, by, leibniz, mechanical, calculators, remained, in, use, until, the, 1970s, in, 1804, french, weaver, joseph, marie, jacquard, developed, a, loom, in, which, the, pattern, being, woven, was, controlled, by, a, paper, tape, constructed, from, punched, cards, the, paper, tape, could, be, changed, without, changing, the, mechanical, design, of, the, loom, this, was, a, landmark, achievement, in, programmability, his, machine, was, an, improvement, over, similar, weaving, looms, punched, cards, were, preceded, by, punch, bands, as, in, the, machine, proposed, by, basile, bouchon, these, bands, would, inspire, information, recording, for, automatic, pianos, and, more, recently, numerical, control, machine, tools, in, the, late, 1880s, the, american, herman, hollerith, invented, data, storage, on, punched, cards, that, could, then, be, read, by, a, machine, to, process, these, punched, cards, he, invented, the, tabulator, and, the, keypunch, machine, his, machines, used, electromechanical, relays, and, counters, hollerith, s, method, was, used, in, the, 1890, united, states, census, that, census, was, processed, two, years, faster, than, the, prior, census, had, been, hollerith, s, company, eventually, became, the, core, of, ibm, by, 1920, electromechanical, tabulating, machines, could, add, subtract, and, print, accumulated, totals, machine, functions, were, directed, by, inserting, dozens, of, wire, jumpers, into, removable, control, panels, when, the, united, states, instituted, social, security, in, 1935, ibm, punched, card, systems, were, used, to, process, records, of, 26, million, workers, punched, cards, became, ubiquitous, in, industry, and, government, for, accounting, and, administration, leslie, comrie, s, articles, on, punched, card, methods, and, w, j, eckert, s, publication, of, punched, card, methods, in, scientific, computation, in, 1940, described, punched, card, techniques, sufficiently, advanced, to, solve, some, differential, equations, or, perform, multiplication, and, division, using, floating, point, representations, all, on, punched, cards, and, unit, record, machines, such, machines, were, used, during, world, war, ii, for, cryptographic, statistical, processing, as, well, as, a, vast, number, of, administrative, uses, the, astronomical, computing, bureau, columbia, university, performed, astronomical, calculations, representing, the, state, of, the, art, in, computing, by, the, 20th, century, earlier, mechanical, calculators, cash, registers, accounting, machines, and, so, on, were, redesigned, to, use, electric, motors, with, gear, position, as, the, representation, for, the, state, of, a, variable, the, word, computer, was, a, job, title, assigned, to, primarily, women, who, used, these, calculators, to, perform, mathematical, calculations, by, the, 1920s, british, scientist, lewis, fry, richardson, s, interest, in, weather, prediction, led, him, to, propose, human, computers, and, numerical, analysis, to, model, the, weather, to, this, day, the, most, powerful, computers, on, earth, are, needed, to, adequately, model, its, weather, using, the, navier, stokes, equations, companies, like, friden, marchant, calculator, and, monroe, made, desktop, mechanical, calculators, from, the, 1930s, that, could, add, subtract, multiply, and, divide, in, 1948, the, curta, was, introduced, by, austrian, inventor, curt, herzstark, it, was, a, small, hand, cranked, mechanical, calculator, and, as, such, a, descendant, of, gottfried, leibniz, s, stepped, reckoner, and, thomas, arithmometer, the, world, s, first, all, electronic, desktop, calculator, was, the, british, bell, punch, anita, released, in, 1961, it, used, vacuum, tubes, cold, cathode, tubes, and, dekatrons, in, its, circuits, with, 12, cold, cathode, nixie, tubes, for, its, display, the, anita, sold, well, since, it, was, the, only, electronic, desktop, calculator, available, and, was, silent, and, quick, the, tube, technology, was, superseded, in, june, 1963, by, the, u, s, manufactured, friden, ec, 130, which, had, an, all, transistor, design, a, stack, of, four, 13, digit, numbers, displayed, on, a, 5, inch, 13, cm, crt, and, introduced, reverse, polish, notation, rpn, charles, babbage, an, english, mechanical, engineer, and, polymath, originated, the, concept, of, a, programmable, computer, though, none, of, his, designs, were, successfully, implemented, until, 1991, often, regarded, as, the, father, of, the, computer, he, conceptualized, and, invented, the, first, mechanical, computer, in, the, early, 19th, century, after, working, on, his, revolutionary, difference, engine, designed, to, aid, in, navigational, calculations, in, 1833, he, realized, that, a, much, more, general, design, an, analytical, engine, was, possible, the, input, of, programs, and, data, was, to, be, provided, to, the, machine, via, punched, cards, a, method, being, used, at, the, time, to, direct, mechanical, looms, such, as, the, jacquard, loom, for, output, the, machine, would, have, a, printer, a, curve, plotter, and, a, bell, the, machine, would, also, be, able, to, punch, numbers, onto, cards, to, be, read, in, later, it, employed, ordinary, base, 10, fixed, point, arithmetic, the, engine, incorporated, an, arithmetic, logic, unit, control, flow, in, the, form, of, conditional, branching, and, loops, and, integrated, memory, making, it, the, first, design, for, a, general, purpose, computer, that, could, be, described, in, modern, terms, as, turing, complete, there, was, to, be, a, store, that, is, a, memory, capable, of, holding, 1, 000, numbers, of, 50, decimal, digits, each, ca, 16, 6, kb, an, arithmetic, unit, the, mill, would, be, able, to, perform, all, four, arithmetic, operations, plus, comparisons, and, optionally, square, roots, initially, 1838, it, was, conceived, as, a, difference, engine, curved, back, upon, itself, in, a, generally, circular, layout, with, the, long, store, exiting, off, to, one, side, later, drawings, 1858, depict, a, regularised, grid, layout, like, the, central, processing, unit, cpu, in, a, modern, computer, the, mill, would, rely, on, its, own, internal, procedures, roughly, equivalent, to, microcode, in, modern, cpus, to, be, stored, in, the, form, of, pegs, inserted, into, rotating, drums, called, barrels, to, carry, out, some, of, the, more, complex, instructions, the, user, s, program, might, specify, the, programming, language, to, be, employed, by, users, was, akin, to, modern, day, assembly, languages, loops, and, conditional, branching, were, possible, and, so, the, language, as, conceived, would, have, been, turing, complete, as, later, defined, by, alan, turing, three, different, types, of, punch, cards, were, used, one, for, arithmetical, operations, one, for, numerical, constants, and, one, for, load, and, store, operations, transferring, numbers, from, the, store, to, the, arithmetical, unit, or, back, there, were, three, separate, readers, for, the, three, types, of, cards, the, project, was, slowed, by, various, problems, including, disputes, with, the, chief, machinist, building, parts, for, it, all, the, parts, for, his, machine, had, to, be, made, by, hand, this, was, a, major, problem, for, a, machine, with, thousands, of, parts, eventually, the, project, was, dissolved, with, the, decision, of, the, british, government, to, cease, funding, babbage, s, failure, to, complete, the, analytical, engine, can, be, chiefly, attributed, to, difficulties, not, only, of, politics, and, financing, but, also, to, his, desire, to, develop, an, increasingly, sophisticated, computer, and, to, move, ahead, faster, than, anyone, else, could, follow, ada, lovelace, translated, and, added, notes, to, the, sketch, of, the, analytical, engine, by, luigi, federico, menabrea, this, appears, to, be, the, first, published, description, of, programming, so, ada, lovelace, is, widely, regarded, as, the, first, computer, programmer, following, babbage, although, at, first, unaware, of, his, earlier, work, was, percy, ludgate, a, clerk, to, a, corn, merchant, in, dublin, ireland, he, independently, designed, a, programmable, mechanical, computer, which, he, described, in, a, work, that, was, published, in, 1909, two, other, inventors, leonardo, torres, quevedo, and, vannevar, bush, also, did, follow, on, research, based, on, babbage, s, work, in, 1914, torres, published, essays, on, automatics, where, he, wrote, about, babbage, s, efforts, at, constructing, a, mechanical, analytical, engine, and, designed, an, electromechanical, analytical, machine, which, was, to, be, controlled, by, a, read, only, program, the, paper, also, introduced, the, idea, of, floating, point, arithmetic, in, 1920, he, presented, in, a, paris, conference, the, electromechanical, arithmometer, an, arithmetic, unit, on, which, commands, could, be, typed, and, the, results, printed, automatically, bush, s, paper, instrumental, analysis, 1936, discussed, using, existing, ibm, punch, card, machines, to, implement, babbage, s, design, in, the, same, year, he, started, the, rapid, arithmetical, machine, project, to, investigate, the, problems, of, constructing, an, electronic, digital, computer, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, analog, computers, were, considered, by, many, to, be, the, future, of, computing, these, devices, used, the, continuously, changeable, aspects, of, physical, phenomena, such, as, electrical, mechanical, or, hydraulic, quantities, to, model, the, problem, being, solved, in, contrast, to, digital, computers, that, represented, varying, quantities, symbolically, as, their, numerical, values, change, as, an, analog, computer, does, not, use, discrete, values, but, rather, continuous, values, processes, cannot, be, reliably, repeated, with, exact, equivalence, as, they, can, with, turing, machines, the, first, modern, analog, computer, was, a, tide, predicting, machine, invented, by, sir, william, thomson, later, lord, kelvin, in, 1872, it, used, a, system, of, pulleys, and, wires, to, automatically, calculate, predicted, tide, levels, for, a, set, period, at, a, particular, location, and, was, of, great, utility, to, navigation, in, shallow, waters, his, device, was, the, foundation, for, further, developments, in, analog, computing, the, differential, analyser, a, mechanical, analog, computer, designed, to, solve, differential, equations, by, integration, using, wheel, and, disc, mechanisms, was, conceptualized, in, 1876, by, james, thomson, the, brother, of, the, more, famous, lord, kelvin, he, explored, the, possible, construction, of, such, calculators, but, was, stymied, by, the, limited, output, torque, of, the, ball, and, disk, integrators, in, a, differential, analyzer, the, output, of, one, integrator, drove, the, input, of, the, next, integrator, or, a, graphing, output, a, notable, series, of, analog, calculating, machines, were, developed, by, leonardo, torres, quevedo, since, 1895, including, one, that, was, able, to, compute, the, roots, of, arbitrary, polynomials, of, order, eight, including, the, complex, ones, with, a, precision, down, to, thousandths, an, important, advance, in, analog, computing, was, the, development, of, the, first, fire, control, systems, for, long, range, ship, gunlaying, when, gunnery, ranges, increased, dramatically, in, the, late, 19th, century, it, was, no, longer, a, simple, matter, of, calculating, the, proper, aim, point, given, the, flight, times, of, the, shells, various, spotters, on, board, the, ship, would, relay, distance, measures, and, observations, to, a, central, plotting, station, there, the, fire, direction, teams, fed, in, the, location, speed, and, direction, of, the, ship, and, its, target, as, well, as, various, adjustments, for, coriolis, effect, weather, effects, on, the, air, and, other, adjustments, the, computer, would, then, output, a, firing, solution, which, would, be, fed, to, the, turrets, for, laying, in, 1912, british, engineer, arthur, pollen, developed, the, first, electrically, powered, mechanical, analogue, computer, called, at, the, time, the, argo, clock, it, was, used, by, the, imperial, russian, navy, in, world, war, i, the, alternative, dreyer, table, fire, control, system, was, fitted, to, british, capital, ships, by, mid, 1916, mechanical, devices, were, also, used, to, aid, the, accuracy, of, aerial, bombing, drift, sight, was, the, first, such, aid, developed, by, harry, wimperis, in, 1916, for, the, royal, naval, air, service, it, measured, the, wind, speed, from, the, air, and, used, that, measurement, to, calculate, the, wind, s, effects, on, the, trajectory, of, the, bombs, the, system, was, later, improved, with, the, course, setting, bomb, sight, and, reached, a, climax, with, world, war, ii, bomb, sights, mark, xiv, bomb, sight, raf, bomber, command, and, the, norden, united, states, army, air, forces, the, art, of, mechanical, analog, computing, reached, its, zenith, with, the, differential, analyzer, built, by, h, l, hazen, and, vannevar, bush, at, mit, starting, in, 1927, which, built, on, the, mechanical, integrators, of, james, thomson, and, the, torque, amplifiers, invented, by, h, w, nieman, a, dozen, of, these, devices, were, built, before, their, obsolescence, became, obvious, the, most, powerful, was, constructed, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, s, moore, school, of, electrical, engineering, where, the, eniac, was, built, a, fully, electronic, analog, computer, was, built, by, helmut, h, lzer, in, 1942, at, peenem, nde, army, research, center, by, the, 1950s, the, success, of, digital, electronic, computers, had, spelled, the, end, for, most, analog, computing, machines, but, hybrid, analog, computers, controlled, by, digital, electronics, remained, in, substantial, use, into, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, and, later, in, some, specialized, applications, the, principle, of, the, modern, computer, was, first, described, by, computer, scientist, alan, turing, who, set, out, the, idea, in, his, seminal, 1936, paper, on, computable, numbers, turing, reformulated, kurt, g, del, s, 1931, results, on, the, limits, of, proof, and, computation, replacing, g, del, s, universal, arithmetic, based, formal, language, with, the, formal, and, simple, hypothetical, devices, that, became, known, as, turing, machines, he, proved, that, some, such, machine, would, be, capable, of, performing, any, conceivable, mathematical, computation, if, it, were, representable, as, an, algorithm, he, went, on, to, prove, that, there, was, no, solution, to, the, entscheidungsproblem, by, first, showing, that, the, halting, problem, for, turing, machines, is, undecidable, in, general, it, is, not, possible, to, decide, algorithmically, whether, a, given, turing, machine, will, ever, halt, he, also, introduced, the, notion, of, a, universal, machine, now, known, as, a, universal, turing, machine, with, the, idea, that, such, a, machine, could, perform, the, tasks, of, any, other, machine, or, in, other, words, it, is, provably, capable, of, computing, anything, that, is, computable, by, executing, a, program, stored, on, tape, allowing, the, machine, to, be, programmable, von, neumann, acknowledged, that, the, central, concept, of, the, modern, computer, was, due, to, this, paper, turing, machines, are, to, this, day, a, central, object, of, study, in, theory, of, computation, except, for, the, limitations, imposed, by, their, finite, memory, stores, modern, computers, are, said, to, be, turing, complete, which, is, to, say, they, have, algorithm, execution, capability, equivalent, to, a, universal, turing, machine, the, era, of, modern, computing, began, with, a, flurry, of, development, before, and, during, world, war, ii, most, digital, computers, built, in, this, period, were, built, with, electromechanical, electric, switches, drove, mechanical, relays, to, perform, the, calculation, these, mechanical, components, had, a, low, operating, speed, due, to, their, mechanical, nature, and, were, eventually, superseded, by, much, faster, all, electric, components, originally, using, vacuum, tubes, and, later, transistors, the, z2, was, one, of, the, earliest, examples, of, an, electric, operated, digital, computer, built, with, electromechanical, relays, and, was, created, by, civil, engineer, konrad, zuse, in, 1940, in, germany, it, was, an, improvement, on, his, earlier, mechanical, z1, although, it, used, the, same, mechanical, memory, it, replaced, the, arithmetic, and, control, logic, with, electrical, relay, circuits, in, the, same, year, electro, mechanical, devices, called, bombes, were, built, by, british, cryptologists, to, help, decipher, german, enigma, machine, encrypted, secret, messages, during, world, war, ii, the, bombe, s, initial, design, was, created, in, 1939, at, the, uk, government, code, and, cypher, school, gc, cs, at, bletchley, park, by, alan, turing, with, an, important, refinement, devised, in, 1940, by, gordon, welchman, the, engineering, design, and, construction, was, the, work, of, harold, keen, of, the, british, tabulating, machine, company, it, was, a, substantial, development, from, a, device, that, had, been, designed, in, 1938, by, polish, cipher, bureau, cryptologist, marian, rejewski, and, known, as, the, cryptologic, bomb, polish, bomba, kryptologiczna, in, 1941, zuse, followed, his, earlier, machine, up, with, the, z3, the, world, s, first, working, electromechanical, programmable, fully, automatic, digital, computer, the, z3, was, built, with, 2000, relays, implementing, a, 22, bit, word, length, that, operated, at, a, clock, frequency, of, about, 5, 10, hz, program, code, and, data, were, stored, on, punched, film, it, was, quite, similar, to, modern, machines, in, some, respects, pioneering, numerous, advances, such, as, floating, point, numbers, replacement, of, the, hard, to, implement, decimal, system, used, in, charles, babbage, s, earlier, design, by, the, simpler, binary, system, meant, that, zuse, s, machines, were, easier, to, build, and, potentially, more, reliable, given, the, technologies, available, at, that, time, the, z3, was, proven, to, have, been, a, turing, complete, machine, in, 1998, by, ra, l, rojas, in, two, 1936, patent, applications, zuse, also, anticipated, that, machine, instructions, could, be, stored, in, the, same, storage, used, for, data, the, key, insight, of, what, became, known, as, the, von, neumann, architecture, first, implemented, in, 1948, in, america, in, the, electromechanical, ibm, ssec, and, in, britain, in, the, fully, electronic, manchester, baby, zuse, suffered, setbacks, during, world, war, ii, when, some, of, his, machines, were, destroyed, in, the, course, of, allied, bombing, campaigns, apparently, his, work, remained, largely, unknown, to, engineers, in, the, uk, and, us, until, much, later, although, at, least, ibm, was, aware, of, it, as, it, financed, his, post, war, startup, company, in, 1946, in, return, for, an, option, on, zuse, s, patents, in, 1944, the, harvard, mark, i, was, constructed, at, ibm, s, endicott, laboratories, it, was, a, similar, general, purpose, electro, mechanical, computer, to, the, z3, but, was, not, quite, turing, complete, the, term, digital, was, first, suggested, by, george, robert, stibitz, and, refers, to, where, a, signal, such, as, a, voltage, is, not, used, to, directly, represent, a, value, as, it, would, be, in, an, analog, computer, but, to, encode, it, in, november, 1937, stibitz, then, working, at, bell, labs, 1930, 1941, completed, a, relay, based, calculator, he, later, dubbed, the, model, k, for, k, itchen, table, on, which, he, had, assembled, it, which, became, the, first, binary, adder, typically, signals, have, two, states, low, usually, representing, 0, and, high, usually, representing, 1, but, sometimes, three, valued, logic, is, used, especially, in, high, density, memory, modern, computers, generally, use, binary, logic, but, many, early, machines, were, decimal, computers, in, these, machines, the, basic, unit, of, data, was, the, decimal, digit, encoded, in, one, of, several, schemes, including, binary, coded, decimal, or, bcd, bi, quinary, excess, 3, and, two, out, of, five, code, the, mathematical, basis, of, digital, computing, is, boolean, algebra, developed, by, the, british, mathematician, george, boole, in, his, work, the, laws, of, thought, published, in, 1854, his, boolean, algebra, was, further, refined, in, the, 1860s, by, william, jevons, and, charles, sanders, peirce, and, was, first, presented, systematically, by, ernst, schr, der, and, a, n, whitehead, in, 1879, gottlob, frege, develops, the, formal, approach, to, logic, and, proposes, the, first, logic, language, for, logical, equations, in, the, 1930s, and, working, independently, american, electronic, engineer, claude, shannon, and, soviet, logician, victor, shestakov, both, showed, a, one, to, one, correspondence, between, the, concepts, of, boolean, logic, and, certain, electrical, circuits, now, called, logic, gates, which, are, now, ubiquitous, in, digital, computers, they, showed, that, electronic, relays, and, switches, can, realize, the, expressions, of, boolean, algebra, this, thesis, essentially, founded, practical, digital, circuit, design, in, addition, shannon, s, paper, gives, a, correct, circuit, diagram, for, a, 4, bit, digital, binary, adder, purely, electronic, circuit, elements, soon, replaced, their, mechanical, and, electromechanical, equivalents, at, the, same, time, that, digital, calculation, replaced, analog, machines, such, as, the, z3, the, atanasoff, berry, computer, the, colossus, computers, and, the, eniac, were, built, by, hand, using, circuits, containing, relays, or, valves, vacuum, tubes, and, often, used, punched, cards, or, punched, paper, tape, for, input, and, as, the, main, non, volatile, storage, medium, engineer, tommy, flowers, joined, the, telecommunications, branch, of, the, general, post, office, in, 1926, while, working, at, the, research, station, in, dollis, hill, in, the, 1930s, he, began, to, explore, the, possible, use, of, electronics, for, the, telephone, exchange, experimental, equipment, that, he, built, in, 1934, went, into, operation, 5, years, later, converting, a, portion, of, the, telephone, exchange, network, into, an, electronic, data, processing, system, using, thousands, of, vacuum, tubes, in, the, us, in, 1940, arthur, dickinson, ibm, invented, the, first, digital, electronic, computer, this, calculating, device, was, fully, electronic, control, calculations, and, output, the, first, electronic, display, john, vincent, atanasoff, and, clifford, e, berry, of, iowa, state, university, developed, the, atanasoff, berry, computer, abc, in, 1942, the, first, binary, electronic, digital, calculating, device, this, design, was, semi, electronic, electro, mechanical, control, and, electronic, calculations, and, used, about, 300, vacuum, tubes, with, capacitors, fixed, in, a, mechanically, rotating, drum, for, memory, however, its, paper, card, writer, reader, was, unreliable, and, the, regenerative, drum, contact, system, was, mechanical, the, machine, s, special, purpose, nature, and, lack, of, changeable, stored, program, distinguish, it, from, modern, computers, computers, whose, logic, was, primarily, built, using, vacuum, tubes, are, now, known, as, first, generation, computers, during, world, war, ii, british, codebreakers, at, bletchley, park, 40, miles, 64, km, north, of, london, achieved, a, number, of, successes, at, breaking, encrypted, enemy, military, communications, the, german, encryption, machine, enigma, was, first, attacked, with, the, help, of, the, electro, mechanical, bombes, they, ruled, out, possible, enigma, settings, by, performing, chains, of, logical, deductions, implemented, electrically, most, possibilities, led, to, a, contradiction, and, the, few, remaining, could, be, tested, by, hand, the, germans, also, developed, a, series, of, teleprinter, encryption, systems, quite, different, from, enigma, the, lorenz, sz, 40, 42, machine, was, used, for, high, level, army, communications, code, named, tunny, by, the, british, the, first, intercepts, of, lorenz, messages, began, in, 1941, as, part, of, an, attack, on, tunny, max, newman, and, his, colleagues, developed, the, heath, robinson, a, fixed, function, machine, to, aid, in, code, breaking, tommy, flowers, a, senior, engineer, at, the, post, office, research, station, was, recommended, to, max, newman, by, alan, turing, and, spent, eleven, months, from, early, february, 1943, designing, and, building, the, more, flexible, colossus, computer, which, superseded, the, heath, robinson, after, a, functional, test, in, december, 1943, colossus, was, shipped, to, bletchley, park, where, it, was, delivered, on, 18, january, 1944, and, attacked, its, first, message, on, 5, february, by, the, time, germany, surrendered, in, may, 1945, there, were, ten, colossi, working, at, bletchley, park, colossus, was, the, world, s, first, electronic, digital, programmable, computer, it, used, a, large, number, of, valves, vacuum, tubes, it, had, paper, tape, input, and, was, capable, of, being, configured, to, perform, a, variety, of, boolean, logical, operations, on, its, data, but, it, was, not, turing, complete, data, input, to, colossus, was, by, photoelectric, reading, of, a, paper, tape, transcription, of, the, enciphered, intercepted, message, this, was, arranged, in, a, continuous, loop, so, that, it, could, be, read, and, re, read, multiple, times, there, being, no, internal, store, for, the, data, the, reading, mechanism, ran, at, 5, 000, characters, per, second, with, the, paper, tape, moving, at, 40, ft, s, 12, 2, m, s, 27, 3, mph, colossus, mark, 1, contained, 1500, thermionic, valves, tubes, but, mark, 2, with, 2400, valves, and, five, processors, in, parallel, was, both, 5, times, faster, and, simpler, to, operate, than, mark, 1, greatly, speeding, the, decoding, process, mark, 2, was, designed, while, mark, 1, was, being, constructed, allen, coombs, took, over, leadership, of, the, colossus, mark, 2, project, when, tommy, flowers, moved, on, to, other, projects, the, first, mark, 2, colossus, became, operational, on, 1, june, 1944, just, in, time, for, the, allied, invasion, of, normandy, on, d, day, most, of, the, use, of, colossus, was, in, determining, the, start, positions, of, the, tunny, rotors, for, a, message, which, was, called, wheel, setting, colossus, included, the, first, ever, use, of, shift, registers, and, systolic, arrays, enabling, five, simultaneous, tests, each, involving, up, to, 100, boolean, calculations, this, enabled, five, different, possible, start, positions, to, be, examined, for, one, transit, of, the, paper, tape, as, well, as, wheel, setting, some, later, colossi, included, mechanisms, intended, to, help, determine, pin, patterns, known, as, wheel, breaking, both, models, were, programmable, using, switches, and, plug, panels, in, a, way, their, predecessors, had, not, been, without, the, use, of, these, machines, the, allies, would, have, been, deprived, of, the, very, valuable, intelligence, that, was, obtained, from, reading, the, vast, quantity, of, enciphered, high, level, telegraphic, messages, between, the, german, high, command, okw, and, their, army, commands, throughout, occupied, europe, details, of, their, existence, design, and, use, were, kept, secret, well, into, the, 1970s, winston, churchill, personally, issued, an, order, for, their, destruction, into, pieces, no, larger, than, a, man, s, hand, to, keep, secret, that, the, british, were, capable, of, cracking, lorenz, sz, cyphers, from, german, rotor, stream, cipher, machines, during, the, oncoming, cold, war, two, of, the, machines, were, transferred, to, the, newly, formed, gchq, and, the, others, were, destroyed, as, a, result, the, machines, were, not, included, in, many, histories, of, computing, a, reconstructed, working, copy, of, one, of, the, colossus, machines, is, now, on, display, at, bletchley, park, the, eniac, electronic, numerical, integrator, and, computer, was, the, first, electronic, programmable, computer, built, in, the, us, although, the, eniac, used, similar, technology, to, the, colossi, it, was, much, faster, and, more, flexible, and, was, turing, complete, like, the, colossi, a, program, on, the, eniac, was, defined, by, the, states, of, its, patch, cables, and, switches, a, far, cry, from, the, stored, program, electronic, machines, that, came, later, once, a, program, was, ready, to, be, run, it, had, to, be, mechanically, set, into, the, machine, with, manual, resetting, of, plugs, and, switches, the, programmers, of, the, eniac, were, women, who, had, been, trained, as, mathematicians, it, combined, the, high, speed, of, electronics, with, the, ability, to, be, programmed, for, many, complex, problems, it, could, add, or, subtract, 5000, times, a, second, a, thousand, times, faster, than, any, other, machine, it, also, had, modules, to, multiply, divide, and, square, root, high, speed, memory, was, limited, to, 20, words, equivalent, to, about, 80, bytes, built, under, the, direction, of, john, mauchly, and, j, presper, eckert, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, eniac, s, development, and, construction, lasted, from, 1943, to, full, operation, at, the, end, of, 1945, the, machine, was, huge, weighing, 30, tons, using, 200, kilowatts, of, electric, power, and, contained, over, 18, 000, vacuum, tubes, 1, 500, relays, and, hundreds, of, thousands, of, resistors, capacitors, and, inductors, one, of, its, major, engineering, feats, was, to, minimize, the, effects, of, tube, burnout, which, was, a, common, problem, in, machine, reliability, at, that, time, the, machine, was, in, almost, constant, use, for, the, next, ten, years, the, theoretical, basis, for, the, stored, program, computer, was, proposed, by, alan, turing, in, his, 1936, paper, on, computable, numbers, whilst, turing, was, at, princeton, working, on, his, phd, john, von, neumann, got, to, know, him, and, became, intrigued, by, his, concept, of, a, universal, computing, machine, early, computing, machines, executed, the, set, sequence, of, steps, known, as, a, program, that, could, be, altered, by, changing, electrical, connections, using, switches, or, a, patch, panel, or, plugboard, however, this, process, of, reprogramming, was, often, difficult, and, time, consuming, requiring, engineers, to, create, flowcharts, and, physically, re, wire, the, machines, stored, program, computers, by, contrast, were, designed, to, store, a, set, of, instructions, a, program, in, memory, typically, the, same, memory, as, stored, data, eniac, inventors, john, mauchly, and, j, presper, eckert, proposed, in, august, 1944, the, construction, of, a, machine, called, the, electronic, discrete, variable, automatic, computer, edvac, and, design, work, for, it, commenced, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, s, moore, school, of, electrical, engineering, before, the, eniac, was, fully, operational, the, design, implemented, a, number, of, important, architectural, and, logical, improvements, conceived, during, the, eniac, s, construction, and, a, high, speed, serial, access, memory, however, eckert, and, mauchly, left, the, project, and, its, construction, floundered, in, 1945, von, neumann, visited, the, moore, school, and, wrote, notes, on, what, he, saw, which, he, sent, to, the, project, the, u, s, army, liaison, there, had, them, typed, and, circulated, as, the, first, draft, of, a, report, on, the, edvac, the, draft, did, not, mention, eckert, and, mauchly, and, despite, its, incomplete, nature, and, questionable, lack, of, attribution, of, the, sources, of, some, of, the, ideas, the, computer, architecture, it, outlined, became, known, as, the, von, neumann, architecture, in, 1945, turing, joined, the, uk, national, physical, laboratory, and, began, work, on, developing, an, electronic, stored, program, digital, computer, his, late, 1945, report, proposed, electronic, calculator, was, the, first, reasonably, detailed, specification, for, such, a, device, turing, presented, a, more, detailed, paper, to, the, national, physical, laboratory, npl, executive, committee, in, march, 1946, giving, the, first, substantially, complete, design, of, a, stored, program, computer, a, device, that, was, called, the, automatic, computing, engine, ace, turing, considered, that, the, speed, and, the, size, of, computer, memory, were, crucial, elements, p, 4, so, he, proposed, a, high, speed, memory, of, what, would, today, be, called, 25, kb, accessed, at, a, speed, of, 1, mhz, the, ace, implemented, subroutine, calls, whereas, the, edvac, did, not, and, the, ace, also, used, abbreviated, computer, instructions, an, early, form, of, programming, language, the, manchester, baby, small, scale, experimental, machine, ssem, was, the, world, s, first, electronic, stored, program, computer, it, was, built, at, the, victoria, university, of, manchester, by, frederic, c, williams, tom, kilburn, and, geoff, tootill, and, ran, its, first, program, on, 21, june, 1948, the, machine, was, not, intended, to, be, a, practical, computer, but, was, instead, designed, as, a, testbed, for, the, williams, tube, the, first, random, access, digital, storage, device, invented, by, freddie, williams, and, tom, kilburn, at, the, university, of, manchester, in, 1946, and, 1947, it, was, a, cathode, ray, tube, that, used, an, effect, called, secondary, emission, to, temporarily, store, electronic, binary, data, and, was, used, successfully, in, several, early, computers, described, as, small, and, primitive, in, a, 1998, retrospective, the, baby, was, the, first, working, machine, to, contain, all, of, the, elements, essential, to, a, modern, electronic, computer, as, soon, as, it, had, demonstrated, the, feasibility, of, its, design, a, project, was, initiated, at, the, university, to, develop, the, design, into, a, more, usable, computer, the, manchester, mark, 1, the, mark, 1, in, turn, quickly, became, the, prototype, for, the, ferranti, mark, 1, the, world, s, first, commercially, available, general, purpose, computer, the, baby, had, a, 32, bit, word, length, and, a, memory, of, 32, words, as, it, was, designed, to, be, the, simplest, possible, stored, program, computer, the, only, arithmetic, operations, implemented, in, hardware, were, subtraction, and, negation, other, arithmetic, operations, were, implemented, in, software, the, first, of, three, programs, written, for, the, machine, found, the, highest, proper, divisor, of, 2, 18, 262, 144, a, calculation, that, was, known, would, take, a, long, time, to, run, and, so, prove, the, computer, s, reliability, by, testing, every, integer, from, 2, 18, 1, downwards, as, division, was, implemented, by, repeated, subtraction, of, the, divisor, the, program, consisted, of, 17, instructions, and, ran, for, 52, minutes, before, reaching, the, correct, answer, of, 131, 072, after, the, baby, had, performed, 3, 5, million, operations, for, an, effective, cpu, speed, of, 1, 1, kips, the, successive, approximations, to, the, answer, were, displayed, as, a, pattern, of, dots, on, the, output, crt, which, mirrored, the, pattern, held, on, the, williams, tube, used, for, storage, the, ssem, led, to, the, development, of, the, manchester, mark, 1, at, the, university, of, manchester, work, began, in, august, 1948, and, the, first, version, was, operational, by, april, 1949, a, program, written, to, search, for, mersenne, primes, ran, error, free, for, nine, hours, on, the, night, of, 16, 17, june, 1949, the, machine, s, successful, operation, was, widely, reported, in, the, british, press, which, used, the, phrase, electronic, brain, in, describing, it, to, their, readers, the, computer, is, especially, historically, significant, because, of, its, pioneering, inclusion, of, index, registers, an, innovation, which, made, it, easier, for, a, program, to, read, sequentially, through, an, array, of, words, in, memory, thirty, four, patents, resulted, from, the, machine, s, development, and, many, of, the, ideas, behind, its, design, were, incorporated, in, subsequent, commercial, products, such, as, the, ibm, 701, and, 702, as, well, as, the, ferranti, mark, 1, the, chief, designers, frederic, c, williams, and, tom, kilburn, concluded, from, their, experiences, with, the, mark, 1, that, computers, would, be, used, more, in, scientific, roles, than, in, pure, mathematics, in, 1951, they, started, development, work, on, meg, the, mark, 1, s, successor, which, would, include, a, floating, point, unit, the, other, contender, for, being, the, first, recognizably, modern, digital, stored, program, computer, was, the, edsac, designed, and, constructed, by, maurice, wilkes, and, his, team, at, the, university, of, cambridge, mathematical, laboratory, in, england, at, the, university, of, cambridge, in, 1949, the, machine, was, inspired, by, john, von, neumann, s, seminal, first, draft, of, a, report, on, the, edvac, and, was, one, of, the, first, usefully, operational, electronic, digital, stored, program, computer, edsac, ran, its, first, programs, on, 6, may, 1949, when, it, calculated, a, table, of, squares, and, a, list, of, prime, numbers, the, edsac, also, served, as, the, basis, for, the, first, commercially, applied, computer, the, leo, i, used, by, food, manufacturing, company, j, lyons, co, ltd, edsac, 1, was, finally, shut, down, on, 11, july, 1958, having, been, superseded, by, edsac, 2, which, stayed, in, use, until, 1965, the, brain, may, one, day, come, down, to, our, level, and, help, with, our, income, tax, and, book, keeping, calculations, but, this, is, speculation, and, there, is, no, sign, of, it, so, far, eniac, inventors, john, mauchly, and, j, presper, eckert, proposed, the, edvac, s, construction, in, august, 1944, and, design, work, for, the, edvac, commenced, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, s, moore, school, of, electrical, engineering, before, the, eniac, was, fully, operational, the, design, implemented, a, number, of, important, architectural, and, logical, improvements, conceived, during, the, eniac, s, construction, and, a, high, speed, serial, access, memory, however, eckert, and, mauchly, left, the, project, and, its, construction, floundered, it, was, finally, delivered, to, the, u, s, army, s, ballistics, research, laboratory, at, the, aberdeen, proving, ground, in, august, 1949, but, due, to, a, number, of, problems, the, computer, only, began, operation, in, 1951, and, then, only, on, a, limited, basis, the, first, commercial, computer, was, the, ferranti, mark, 1, built, by, ferranti, and, delivered, to, the, university, of, manchester, in, february, 1951, it, was, based, on, the, manchester, mark, 1, the, main, improvements, over, the, manchester, mark, 1, were, in, the, size, of, the, primary, storage, using, random, access, williams, tubes, secondary, storage, using, a, magnetic, drum, a, faster, multiplier, and, additional, instructions, the, basic, cycle, time, was, 1, 2, milliseconds, and, a, multiplication, could, be, completed, in, about, 2, 16, milliseconds, the, multiplier, used, almost, a, quarter, of, the, machine, s, 4, 050, vacuum, tubes, valves, a, second, machine, was, purchased, by, the, university, of, toronto, before, the, design, was, revised, into, the, mark, 1, star, at, least, seven, of, these, later, machines, were, delivered, between, 1953, and, 1957, one, of, them, to, shell, labs, in, amsterdam, in, october, 1947, the, directors, of, j, lyons, company, a, british, catering, company, famous, for, its, teashops, but, with, strong, interests, in, new, office, management, techniques, decided, to, take, an, active, role, in, promoting, the, commercial, development, of, computers, the, leo, i, computer, lyons, electronic, office, became, operational, in, april, 1951, and, ran, the, world, s, first, regular, routine, office, computer, job, on, 17, november, 1951, the, j, lyons, company, began, weekly, operation, of, a, bakery, valuations, job, on, the, leo, the, first, business, application, to, go, live, on, a, stored, program, computer, in, june, 1951, the, univac, i, universal, automatic, computer, was, delivered, to, the, u, s, census, bureau, remington, rand, eventually, sold, 46, machines, at, more, than, us, 1, million, each, 11, 7, million, as, of, 2024, univac, was, the, first, mass, produced, computer, it, used, 5, 200, vacuum, tubes, and, consumed, 125, kw, of, power, its, primary, storage, was, serial, access, mercury, delay, lines, capable, of, storing, 1, 000, words, of, 11, decimal, digits, plus, sign, 72, bit, words, in, 1952, compagnie, des, machines, bull, released, the, gamma, 3, computer, which, became, a, large, success, in, europe, eventually, selling, more, than, 1, 200, units, and, the, first, computer, produced, in, more, than, 1, 000, units, the, gamma, 3, had, innovative, features, for, its, time, including, a, dual, mode, software, switchable, bcd, and, binary, alu, as, well, as, a, hardwired, floating, point, library, for, scientific, computing, in, its, e, t, configuration, the, gamma, 3, drum, memory, could, fit, about, 50, 000, instructions, for, a, capacity, of, 16, 384, words, around, 100, kb, a, large, amount, for, the, time, compared, to, the, univac, ibm, introduced, a, smaller, more, affordable, computer, in, 1954, that, proved, very, popular, the, ibm, 650, weighed, over, 900, kg, the, attached, power, supply, weighed, around, 1350, kg, and, both, were, held, in, separate, cabinets, of, roughly, 1, 5, 0, 9, 1, 8, m, the, system, cost, us, 500, 000, 5, 67, million, as, of, 2024, or, could, be, leased, for, us, 3, 500, a, month, 40, 000, as, of, 2024, its, drum, memory, was, originally, 2, 000, ten, digit, words, later, expanded, to, 4, 000, words, memory, limitations, such, as, this, were, to, dominate, programming, for, decades, afterward, the, program, instructions, were, fetched, from, the, spinning, drum, as, the, code, ran, efficient, execution, using, drum, memory, was, provided, by, a, combination, of, hardware, architecture, the, instruction, format, included, the, address, of, the, next, instruction, and, software, the, symbolic, optimal, assembly, program, soap, assigned, instructions, to, the, optimal, addresses, to, the, extent, possible, by, static, analysis, of, the, source, program, thus, many, instructions, were, when, needed, located, in, the, next, row, of, the, drum, to, be, read, and, additional, wait, time, for, drum, rotation, was, reduced, in, 1951, british, scientist, maurice, wilkes, developed, the, concept, of, microprogramming, from, the, realisation, that, the, central, processing, unit, of, a, computer, could, be, controlled, by, a, miniature, highly, specialized, computer, program, in, high, speed, rom, microprogramming, allows, the, base, instruction, set, to, be, defined, or, extended, by, built, in, programs, now, called, firmware, or, microcode, this, concept, greatly, simplified, cpu, development, he, first, described, this, at, the, university, of, manchester, computer, inaugural, conference, in, 1951, then, published, in, expanded, form, in, ieee, spectrum, in, 1955, it, was, widely, used, in, the, cpus, and, floating, point, units, of, mainframe, and, other, computers, it, was, implemented, for, the, first, time, in, edsac, 2, which, also, used, multiple, identical, bit, slices, to, simplify, design, interchangeable, replaceable, tube, assemblies, were, used, for, each, bit, of, the, processor, magnetic, drum, memories, were, developed, for, the, us, navy, during, ww, ii, with, the, work, continuing, at, engineering, research, associates, era, in, 1946, and, 1947, era, then, a, part, of, univac, included, a, drum, memory, in, its, 1103, announced, in, february, 1953, the, first, mass, produced, computer, the, ibm, 650, also, announced, in, 1953, had, about, 8, 5, kilobytes, of, drum, memory, magnetic, core, memory, patented, in, 1949, with, its, first, usage, demonstrated, for, the, whirlwind, computer, in, august, 1953, commercialization, followed, quickly, magnetic, core, was, used, in, peripherals, of, the, ibm, 702, delivered, in, july, 1955, and, later, in, the, 702, itself, the, ibm, 704, 1955, and, the, ferranti, mercury, 1957, used, magnetic, core, memory, it, went, on, to, dominate, the, field, into, the, 1970s, when, it, was, replaced, with, semiconductor, memory, magnetic, core, peaked, in, volume, about, 1975, and, declined, in, usage, and, market, share, thereafter, as, late, as, 1980, pdp, 11, 45, machines, using, magnetic, core, main, memory, and, drums, for, swapping, were, still, in, use, at, many, of, the, original, unix, sites, the, bipolar, transistor, was, invented, in, 1947, from, 1955, onward, transistors, replaced, vacuum, tubes, in, computer, designs, giving, rise, to, the, second, generation, of, computers, compared, to, vacuum, tubes, transistors, have, many, advantages, they, are, smaller, and, require, less, power, than, vacuum, tubes, so, give, off, less, heat, silicon, junction, transistors, were, much, more, reliable, than, vacuum, tubes, and, had, longer, service, life, transistorized, computers, could, contain, tens, of, thousands, of, binary, logic, circuits, in, a, relatively, compact, space, transistors, greatly, reduced, computers, size, initial, cost, and, operating, cost, typically, second, generation, computers, were, composed, of, large, numbers, of, printed, circuit, boards, such, as, the, ibm, standard, modular, system, each, carrying, one, to, four, logic, gates, or, flip, flops, at, the, university, of, manchester, a, team, under, the, leadership, of, tom, kilburn, designed, and, built, a, machine, using, the, newly, developed, transistors, instead, of, valves, initially, the, only, devices, available, were, germanium, point, contact, transistors, less, reliable, than, the, valves, they, replaced, but, which, consumed, far, less, power, their, first, transistorized, computer, and, the, first, in, the, world, was, operational, by, 1953, and, a, second, version, was, completed, there, in, april, 1955, the, 1955, version, used, 200, transistors, 1, 300, solid, state, diodes, and, had, a, power, consumption, of, 150, watts, however, the, machine, did, make, use, of, valves, to, generate, its, 125, khz, clock, waveforms, and, in, the, circuitry, to, read, and, write, on, its, magnetic, drum, memory, so, it, was, not, the, first, completely, transistorized, computer, that, distinction, goes, to, the, harwell, cadet, of, 1955, built, by, the, electronics, division, of, the, atomic, energy, research, establishment, at, harwell, the, design, featured, a, 64, kilobyte, magnetic, drum, memory, store, with, multiple, moving, heads, that, had, been, designed, at, the, national, physical, laboratory, uk, by, 1953, this, team, had, transistor, circuits, operating, to, read, and, write, on, a, smaller, magnetic, drum, from, the, royal, radar, establishment, the, machine, used, a, low, clock, speed, of, only, 58, khz, to, avoid, having, to, use, any, valves, to, generate, the, clock, waveforms, cadet, used, 324, point, contact, transistors, provided, by, the, uk, company, standard, telephones, and, cables, 76, junction, transistors, were, used, for, the, first, stage, amplifiers, for, data, read, from, the, drum, since, point, contact, transistors, were, too, noisy, from, august, 1956, cadet, was, offering, a, regular, computing, service, during, which, it, often, executed, continuous, computing, runs, of, 80, hours, or, more, problems, with, the, reliability, of, early, batches, of, point, contact, and, alloyed, junction, transistors, meant, that, the, machine, s, mean, time, between, failures, was, about, 90, minutes, but, this, improved, once, the, more, reliable, bipolar, junction, transistors, became, available, the, manchester, university, transistor, computer, s, design, was, adopted, by, the, local, engineering, firm, of, metropolitan, vickers, in, their, metrovick, 950, the, first, commercial, transistor, computer, anywhere, six, metrovick, 950s, were, built, the, first, completed, in, 1956, they, were, successfully, deployed, within, various, departments, of, the, company, and, were, in, use, for, about, five, years, a, second, generation, computer, the, ibm, 1401, captured, about, one, third, of, the, world, market, ibm, installed, more, than, ten, thousand, 1401s, between, 1960, and, 1964, transistorized, electronics, improved, not, only, the, cpu, central, processing, unit, but, also, the, peripheral, devices, the, second, generation, disk, data, storage, units, were, able, to, store, tens, of, millions, of, letters, and, digits, next, to, the, fixed, disk, storage, units, connected, to, the, cpu, via, high, speed, data, transmission, were, removable, disk, data, storage, units, a, removable, disk, pack, can, be, easily, exchanged, with, another, pack, in, a, few, seconds, even, if, the, removable, disks, capacity, is, smaller, than, fixed, disks, their, interchangeability, guarantees, a, nearly, unlimited, quantity, of, data, close, at, hand, magnetic, tape, provided, archival, capability, for, this, data, at, a, lower, cost, than, disk, many, second, generation, cpus, delegated, peripheral, device, communications, to, a, secondary, processor, for, example, while, the, communication, processor, controlled, card, reading, and, punching, the, main, cpu, executed, calculations, and, binary, branch, instructions, one, databus, would, bear, data, between, the, main, cpu, and, core, memory, at, the, cpu, s, fetch, execute, cycle, rate, and, other, databusses, would, typically, serve, the, peripheral, devices, on, the, pdp, 1, the, core, memory, s, cycle, time, was, 5, microseconds, consequently, most, arithmetic, instructions, took, 10, microseconds, 100, 000, operations, per, second, because, most, operations, took, at, least, two, memory, cycles, one, for, the, instruction, one, for, the, operand, data, fetch, during, the, second, generation, remote, terminal, units, often, in, the, form, of, teleprinters, like, a, friden, flexowriter, saw, greatly, increased, use, telephone, connections, provided, sufficient, speed, for, early, remote, terminals, and, allowed, hundreds, of, kilometers, separation, between, remote, terminals, and, the, computing, center, eventually, these, stand, alone, computer, networks, would, be, generalized, into, an, interconnected, network, of, networks, the, internet, the, early, 1960s, saw, the, advent, of, supercomputing, the, atlas, was, a, joint, development, between, the, university, of, manchester, ferranti, and, plessey, and, was, first, installed, at, manchester, university, and, officially, commissioned, in, 1962, as, one, of, the, world, s, first, supercomputers, considered, to, be, the, most, powerful, computer, in, the, world, at, that, time, it, was, said, that, whenever, atlas, went, offline, half, of, the, united, kingdom, s, computer, capacity, was, lost, it, was, a, second, generation, machine, using, discrete, germanium, transistors, atlas, also, pioneered, the, atlas, supervisor, considered, by, many, to, be, the, first, recognisable, modern, operating, system, in, the, us, a, series, of, computers, at, control, data, corporation, cdc, were, designed, by, seymour, cray, to, use, innovative, designs, and, parallelism, to, achieve, superior, computational, peak, performance, the, cdc, 6600, released, in, 1964, is, generally, considered, the, first, supercomputer, the, cdc, 6600, outperformed, its, predecessor, the, ibm, 7030, stretch, by, about, a, factor, of, 3, with, performance, of, about, 1, megaflops, the, cdc, 6600, was, the, world, s, fastest, computer, from, 1964, to, 1969, when, it, relinquished, that, status, to, its, successor, the, cdc, 7600, the, third, generation, of, digital, electronic, computers, used, integrated, circuit, ic, chips, as, the, basis, of, their, logic, the, idea, of, an, integrated, circuit, was, conceived, by, a, radar, scientist, working, for, the, royal, radar, establishment, of, the, ministry, of, defence, geoffrey, w, a, dummer, the, first, working, integrated, circuits, were, invented, by, jack, kilby, at, texas, instruments, and, robert, noyce, at, fairchild, semiconductor, kilby, recorded, his, initial, ideas, concerning, the, integrated, circuit, in, july, 1958, successfully, demonstrating, the, first, working, integrated, example, on, 12, september, 1958, kilby, s, invention, was, a, hybrid, integrated, circuit, hybrid, ic, it, had, external, wire, connections, which, made, it, difficult, to, mass, produce, noyce, came, up, with, his, own, idea, of, an, integrated, circuit, half, a, year, after, kilby, noyce, s, invention, was, a, monolithic, integrated, circuit, ic, chip, his, chip, solved, many, practical, problems, that, kilby, s, had, not, produced, at, fairchild, semiconductor, it, was, made, of, silicon, whereas, kilby, s, chip, was, made, of, germanium, the, basis, for, noyce, s, monolithic, ic, was, fairchild, s, planar, process, which, allowed, integrated, circuits, to, be, laid, out, using, the, same, principles, as, those, of, printed, circuits, the, planar, process, was, developed, by, noyce, s, colleague, jean, hoerni, in, early, 1959, based, on, mohamed, m, atalla, s, work, on, semiconductor, surface, passivation, by, silicon, dioxide, at, bell, labs, in, the, late, 1950s, third, generation, integrated, circuit, computers, first, appeared, in, the, early, 1960s, in, computers, developed, for, government, purposes, and, then, in, commercial, computers, beginning, in, the, mid, 1960s, the, first, silicon, ic, computer, was, the, apollo, guidance, computer, or, agc, although, not, the, most, powerful, computer, of, its, time, the, extreme, constraints, on, size, mass, and, power, of, the, apollo, spacecraft, required, the, agc, to, be, much, smaller, and, denser, than, any, prior, computer, weighing, in, at, only, 70, pounds, 32, kg, each, lunar, landing, mission, carried, two, agcs, one, each, in, the, command, and, lunar, ascent, modules, the, mosfet, metal, oxide, semiconductor, field, effect, transistor, or, mos, transistor, was, invented, by, mohamed, m, atalla, and, dawon, kahng, at, bell, labs, in, 1959, in, addition, to, data, processing, the, mosfet, enabled, the, practical, use, of, mos, transistors, as, memory, cell, storage, elements, a, function, previously, served, by, magnetic, cores, semiconductor, memory, also, known, as, mos, memory, was, cheaper, and, consumed, less, power, than, magnetic, core, memory, mos, random, access, memory, ram, in, the, form, of, static, ram, sram, was, developed, by, john, schmidt, at, fairchild, semiconductor, in, 1964, in, 1966, robert, dennard, at, the, ibm, thomas, j, watson, research, center, developed, mos, dynamic, ram, dram, in, 1967, dawon, kahng, and, simon, sze, at, bell, labs, developed, the, floating, gate, mosfet, the, basis, for, mos, non, volatile, memory, such, as, eprom, eeprom, and, flash, memory, the, fourth, generation, of, digital, electronic, computers, used, microprocessors, as, the, basis, of, their, logic, the, microprocessor, has, origins, in, the, mos, integrated, circuit, mos, ic, chip, due, to, rapid, mosfet, scaling, mos, ic, chips, rapidly, increased, in, complexity, at, a, rate, predicted, by, moore, s, law, leading, to, large, scale, integration, lsi, with, hundreds, of, transistors, on, a, single, mos, chip, by, the, late, 1960s, the, application, of, mos, lsi, chips, to, computing, was, the, basis, for, the, first, microprocessors, as, engineers, began, recognizing, that, a, complete, computer, processor, could, be, contained, on, a, single, mos, lsi, chip, the, subject, of, exactly, which, device, was, the, first, microprocessor, is, contentious, partly, due, to, lack, of, agreement, on, the, exact, definition, of, the, term, microprocessor, the, earliest, multi, chip, microprocessors, were, the, four, phase, systems, al, 1, in, 1969, and, garrett, airesearch, mp944, in, 1970, developed, with, multiple, mos, lsi, chips, the, first, single, chip, microprocessor, was, the, intel, 4004, developed, on, a, single, pmos, lsi, chip, it, was, designed, and, realized, by, ted, hoff, federico, faggin, masatoshi, shima, and, stanley, mazor, at, intel, and, released, in, 1971, tadashi, sasaki, and, masatoshi, shima, at, busicom, a, calculator, manufacturer, had, the, initial, insight, that, the, cpu, could, be, a, single, mos, lsi, chip, supplied, by, intel, while, the, earliest, microprocessor, ics, literally, contained, only, the, processor, i, e, the, central, processing, unit, of, a, computer, their, progressive, development, naturally, led, to, chips, containing, most, or, all, of, the, internal, electronic, parts, of, a, computer, the, integrated, circuit, in, the, image, on, the, right, for, example, an, intel, 8742, is, an, 8, bit, microcontroller, that, includes, a, cpu, running, at, 12, mhz, 128, bytes, of, ram, 2048, bytes, of, eprom, and, i, o, in, the, same, chip, during, the, 1960s, there, was, considerable, overlap, between, second, and, third, generation, technologies, ibm, implemented, its, ibm, solid, logic, technology, modules, in, hybrid, circuits, for, the, ibm, system, 360, in, 1964, as, late, as, 1975, sperry, univac, continued, the, manufacture, of, second, generation, machines, such, as, the, univac, 494, the, burroughs, large, systems, such, as, the, b5000, were, stack, machines, which, allowed, for, simpler, programming, these, pushdown, automatons, were, also, implemented, in, minicomputers, and, microprocessors, later, which, influenced, programming, language, design, minicomputers, served, as, low, cost, computer, centers, for, industry, business, and, universities, it, became, possible, to, simulate, analog, circuits, with, the, simulation, program, with, integrated, circuit, emphasis, or, spice, 1971, on, minicomputers, one, of, the, programs, for, electronic, design, automation, eda, the, microprocessor, led, to, the, development, of, microcomputers, small, low, cost, computers, that, could, be, owned, by, individuals, and, small, businesses, microcomputers, the, first, of, which, appeared, in, the, 1970s, became, ubiquitous, in, the, 1980s, and, beyond, while, which, specific, product, is, considered, the, first, microcomputer, system, is, a, matter, of, debate, one, of, the, earliest, is, r2e, s, micral, n, fran, ois, gernelle, andr, truong, launched, early, 1973, using, the, intel, 8008, the, first, commercially, available, microcomputer, kit, was, the, intel, 8080, based, altair, 8800, which, was, announced, in, the, january, 1975, cover, article, of, popular, electronics, however, the, altair, 8800, was, an, extremely, limited, system, in, its, initial, stages, having, only, 256, bytes, of, dram, in, its, initial, package, and, no, input, output, except, its, toggle, switches, and, led, register, display, despite, this, it, was, initially, surprisingly, popular, with, several, hundred, sales, in, the, first, year, and, demand, rapidly, outstripped, supply, several, early, third, party, vendors, such, as, cromemco, and, processor, technology, soon, began, supplying, additional, s, 100, bus, hardware, for, the, altair, 8800, in, april, 1975, at, the, hannover, fair, olivetti, presented, the, p6060, the, world, s, first, complete, pre, assembled, personal, computer, system, the, central, processing, unit, consisted, of, two, cards, code, named, puce1, and, puce2, and, unlike, most, other, personal, computers, was, built, with, ttl, components, rather, than, a, microprocessor, it, had, one, or, two, 8, floppy, disk, drives, a, 32, character, plasma, display, 80, column, graphical, thermal, printer, 48, kbytes, of, ram, and, basic, language, it, weighed, 40, kg, 88, lb, as, a, complete, system, this, was, a, significant, step, from, the, altair, though, it, never, achieved, the, same, success, it, was, in, competition, with, a, similar, product, by, ibm, that, had, an, external, floppy, disk, drive, from, 1975, to, 1977, most, microcomputers, such, as, the, mos, technology, kim, 1, the, altair, 8800, and, some, versions, of, the, apple, i, were, sold, as, kits, for, do, it, yourselfers, pre, assembled, systems, did, not, gain, much, ground, until, 1977, with, the, introduction, of, the, apple, ii, the, tandy, trs, 80, the, first, swtpc, computers, and, the, commodore, pet, computing, has, evolved, with, microcomputer, architectures, with, features, added, from, their, larger, brethren, now, dominant, in, most, market, segments, a, next, computer, and, its, object, oriented, development, tools, and, libraries, were, used, by, tim, berners, lee, and, robert, cailliau, at, cern, to, develop, the, world, s, first, web, server, software, cern, httpd, and, also, used, to, write, the, first, web, browser, worldwideweb, systems, as, complicated, as, computers, require, very, high, reliability, eniac, remained, on, in, continuous, operation, from, 1947, to, 1955, for, eight, years, before, being, shut, down, although, a, vacuum, tube, might, fail, it, would, be, replaced, without, bringing, down, the, system, by, the, simple, strategy, of, never, shutting, down, eniac, the, failures, were, dramatically, reduced, the, vacuum, tube, sage, air, defense, computers, became, remarkably, reliable, installed, in, pairs, one, off, line, tubes, likely, to, fail, did, so, when, the, computer, was, intentionally, run, at, reduced, power, to, find, them, hot, pluggable, hard, disks, like, the, hot, pluggable, vacuum, tubes, of, yesteryear, continue, the, tradition, of, repair, during, continuous, operation, semiconductor, memories, routinely, have, no, errors, when, they, operate, although, operating, systems, like, unix, have, employed, memory, tests, on, start, up, to, detect, failing, hardware, today, the, requirement, of, reliable, performance, is, made, even, more, stringent, when, server, farms, are, the, delivery, platform, google, has, managed, this, by, using, fault, tolerant, software, to, recover, from, hardware, failures, and, is, even, working, on, the, concept, of, replacing, entire, server, farms, on, the, fly, during, a, service, event, in, the, 21st, century, multi, core, cpus, became, commercially, available, content, addressable, memory, cam, has, become, inexpensive, enough, to, be, used, in, networking, and, is, frequently, used, for, on, chip, cache, memory, in, modern, microprocessors, although, no, computer, system, has, yet, implemented, hardware, cams, for, use, in, programming, languages, currently, cams, or, associative, arrays, in, software, are, programming, language, specific, semiconductor, memory, cell, arrays, are, very, regular, structures, and, manufacturers, prove, their, processes, on, them, this, allows, price, reductions, on, memory, products, during, the, 1980s, cmos, logic, gates, developed, into, devices, that, could, be, made, as, fast, as, other, circuit, types, computer, power, consumption, could, therefore, be, decreased, dramatically, unlike, the, continuous, current, draw, of, a, gate, based, on, other, logic, types, a, cmos, gate, only, draws, significant, current, except, for, leakage, during, the, transition, between, logic, states, cmos, circuits, have, allowed, computing, to, become, a, commodity, which, is, now, ubiquitous, embedded, in, many, forms, from, greeting, cards, and, telephones, to, satellites, the, thermal, design, power, which, is, dissipated, during, operation, has, become, as, essential, as, computing, speed, of, operation, in, 2006, servers, consumed, 1, 5, of, the, total, energy, budget, of, the, u, s, the, energy, consumption, of, computer, data, centers, was, expected, to, double, to, 3, of, world, consumption, by, 2011, the, soc, system, on, a, chip, has, compressed, even, more, of, the, integrated, circuitry, into, a, single, chip, socs, are, enabling, phones, and, pcs, to, converge, into, single, hand, held, wireless, mobile, devices, quantum, computing, is, an, emerging, technology, in, the, field, of, computing, mit, technology, review, reported, 10, november, 2017, that, ibm, has, created, a, 50, qubit, computer, currently, its, quantum, state, lasts, 50, microseconds, google, researchers, have, been, able, to, extend, the, 50, microsecond, time, limit, as, reported, 14, july, 2021, in, nature, stability, has, been, extended, 100, fold, by, spreading, a, single, logical, qubit, over, chains, of, data, qubits, for, quantum, error, correction, physical, review, x, reported, a, technique, for, single, gate, sensing, as, a, viable, readout, method, for, spin, qubits, a, singlet, triplet, spin, state, in, silicon, on, 26, november, 2018, a, google, team, has, succeeded, in, operating, their, rf, pulse, modulator, chip, at, 3, kelvins, simplifying, the, cryogenics, of, their, 72, qubit, computer, which, is, set, up, to, operate, at, 0, 3, k, but, the, readout, circuitry, and, another, driver, remain, to, be, brought, into, the, cryogenics, see, quantum, supremacy, silicon, qubit, systems, have, demonstrated, entanglement, at, non, local, distances, computing, hardware, and, its, software, have, even, become, a, metaphor, for, the, operation, of, the, universe, an, indication, of, the, rapidity, of, development, of, this, field, can, be, inferred, from, the, history, of, the, seminal, 1947, article, by, burks, goldstine, and, von, neumann, by, the, time, that, anyone, had, time, to, write, anything, down, it, was, obsolete, after, 1945, others, read, john, von, neumann, s, first, draft, of, a, report, on, the, edvac, and, immediately, started, implementing, their, own, systems, to, this, day, the, rapid, pace, of, development, has, continued, worldwide
