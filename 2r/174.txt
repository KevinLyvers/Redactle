classical, antiquity, c, 600, ad, that, comprised, a, loose, collection, of, culturally, and, linguistically, related, city, states, and, other, territories, prior, to, the, roman, period, most, of, these, regions, were, officially, unified, once, under, the, kingdom, of, macedon, from, 338, to, 323, bc, in, western, history, the, era, of, classical, antiquity, was, immediately, followed, by, the, early, middle, ages, and, the, byzantine, period, three, centuries, after, the, decline, of, mycenaean, greece, during, the, bronze, age, collapse, greek, urban, poleis, began, to, form, in, the, 8th, century, bc, ushering, in, the, archaic, period, and, the, colonization, of, the, mediterranean, basin, this, was, followed, by, the, age, of, classical, greece, from, the, greco, persian, wars, to, the, death, of, alexander, the, great, in, 323, bc, and, which, included, the, golden, age, of, athens, and, the, peloponnesian, war, the, unification, of, greece, by, macedon, under, philip, ii, and, subsequent, conquest, of, the, achaemenid, empire, by, alexander, the, great, spread, hellenistic, civilization, across, the, middle, east, the, hellenistic, period, is, considered, to, have, ended, in, 30, bc, when, the, last, hellenistic, kingdom, ptolemaic, egypt, was, annexed, by, the, roman, republic, classical, greek, culture, especially, philosophy, had, a, powerful, influence, on, ancient, rome, which, carried, a, version, of, it, throughout, the, mediterranean, and, much, of, europe, for, this, reason, classical, greece, is, generally, considered, the, cradle, of, western, civilization, the, seminal, culture, from, which, the, modern, west, derives, many, of, its, founding, archetypes, and, ideas, in, politics, philosophy, science, and, art, classical, antiquity, in, the, mediterranean, region, is, commonly, considered, to, have, begun, in, the, 8th, century, bc, around, the, time, of, the, earliest, recorded, poetry, of, homer, and, ended, in, the, 6th, century, ad, classical, antiquity, in, greece, was, preceded, by, the, greek, dark, ages, c, 1200, c, 800, bc, archaeologically, characterised, by, the, protogeometric, and, geometric, styles, of, designs, on, pottery, following, the, dark, ages, was, the, archaic, period, beginning, around, the, 8th, century, bc, which, saw, early, developments, in, greek, culture, and, society, leading, to, the, classical, period, from, the, persian, invasion, of, greece, in, 480, bc, until, the, death, of, alexander, the, great, in, 323, bc, the, classical, period, is, characterized, by, a, classical, style, i, e, one, which, was, considered, exemplary, by, later, observers, most, famously, in, the, parthenon, of, athens, politically, the, classical, period, was, dominated, by, athens, and, the, delian, league, during, the, 5th, century, but, displaced, by, spartan, hegemony, during, the, early, 4th, century, bc, before, power, shifted, to, thebes, and, the, boeotian, league, and, finally, to, the, league, of, corinth, led, by, macedon, this, period, was, shaped, by, the, greco, persian, wars, the, peloponnesian, war, and, the, rise, of, macedon, following, the, classical, period, was, the, hellenistic, period, 323, 146, bc, during, which, greek, culture, and, power, expanded, into, the, near, and, middle, east, from, the, death, of, alexander, until, the, roman, conquest, roman, greece, is, usually, counted, from, the, roman, victory, over, the, corinthians, at, the, battle, of, corinth, in, 146, bc, to, the, establishment, of, byzantium, by, constantine, as, the, capital, of, the, roman, empire, in, 330, ad, finally, late, antiquity, refers, to, the, period, of, christianization, during, the, later, 4th, to, early, 6th, centuries, ad, consummated, by, the, closure, of, the, academy, of, athens, by, justinian, i, in, 529, the, historical, period, of, ancient, greece, is, unique, in, world, history, as, the, first, period, attested, directly, in, comprehensive, narrative, historiography, while, earlier, ancient, history, or, protohistory, is, known, from, much, more, fragmentary, documents, such, as, annals, king, lists, and, pragmatic, epigraphy, herodotus, is, widely, known, as, the, father, of, history, his, histories, are, eponymous, of, the, entire, field, written, between, the, 450s, and, 420s, bc, herodotus, work, reaches, about, a, century, into, the, past, discussing, 6th, century, bc, historical, figures, such, as, darius, i, of, persia, cambyses, ii, and, psamtik, iii, and, alluding, to, some, 8th, century, bc, persons, such, as, candaules, the, accuracy, of, herodotus, works, is, debated, herodotus, was, succeeded, by, authors, such, as, thucydides, xenophon, demosthenes, plato, and, aristotle, most, were, either, athenian, or, pro, athenian, which, is, why, far, more, is, known, about, the, history, and, politics, of, athens, than, of, many, other, cities, their, scope, is, further, limited, by, a, focus, on, political, military, and, diplomatic, history, ignoring, economic, and, social, history, the, archaic, period, lasting, from, approximately, 800, to, 500, bc, saw, the, culmination, of, political, and, social, developments, which, had, begun, in, the, greek, dark, age, with, the, polis, city, state, becoming, the, most, important, unit, of, political, organisation, in, greece, the, absence, of, powerful, states, in, greece, after, the, collapse, of, mycenaean, power, and, the, geography, of, greece, where, many, settlements, were, separated, from, their, neighbours, by, mountainous, terrain, encouraged, the, development, of, small, independent, city, states, several, greek, states, saw, tyrants, rise, to, power, in, this, period, most, famously, at, corinth, from, 657, bc, the, period, also, saw, the, founding, of, greek, colonies, around, the, mediterranean, with, euboean, settlements, at, al, mina, in, the, east, as, early, as, 800, bc, and, ischia, in, the, west, by, 775,

development, of, the, greek, alphabet, athens, developed, its, democratic, system, over, the, course, of, the, archaic, period, already, in, the, seventh, century, the, right, of, all, citizen, men, to, attend, the, assembly, appears, to, have, been, established, after, a, failed, coup, led, by, cylon, of, athens, around, 636, bc, draco, was, appointed, to, establish, a, code, of, laws, in, 621, this, failed, to, reduce, the, political, tension, between, the, poor, and, the, elites, and, in, 594, solon, was, given, the, authority, to, enact, another, set, of, reforms, which, attempted, to, balance, the, power, of, the, rich, and, the, poor, in, the, middle, of, the, sixth, century, pisistratus, established, himself, as, a, tyrant, and, after, his, death, in, 527, his, son, hippias, inherited, his, position, by, the, end, of, the, sixth, century, he, had, been, overthrown, and, cleisthenes, carried, out, further, democratising, reforms, in, sparta, a, political, system, with, two, kings, a, council, of, elders, and, five, ephors, developed, over, the, course, of, the, eighth, and, seventh, century, according, to, spartan, tradition, this, constitution, was, established, by, the, legendary, lawgiver, lycurgus, over, the, course, of, the, first, and, second, messenian, wars, sparta, subjugated, the, neighbouring, region, of, messenia, enserfing, the, population, in, the, sixth, century, greek, city, states, began, to, develop, formal, relationships, with, one, another, where, previously, individual, rulers, had, relied, on, personal, relationships, with, the, elites, of, other, cities, towards, the, end, of, the, archaic, period, sparta, began, to, build, a, series, of, alliances, the, peloponnesian, league, with, cities, including, corinth, elis, and, megara, isolating, messenia, and, reinforcing, sparta, s, position, against, argos, the, other, major, power, in, the, peloponnese, other, alliances, in, the, sixth, century, included, those, between, elis, and, heraea, in, the, peloponnese, and, between, the, greek, colony, sybaris, in, southern, italy, its, allies, and, the, serdaioi, in, 499, bc, the, ionian, city, states, under, persian, rule, rebelled, against, their, persian, supported, tyrant, rulers, supported, by, troops, sent, from, athens, and, eretria, they, advanced, as, far, as, sardis, and, burnt, the, city, before, being, driven, back, by, a, persian, counterattack, the, revolt, continued, until, 494, when, the, rebelling, ionians, were, defeated, darius, did, not, forget, that, athens, had, assisted, the, ionian, revolt, and, in, 490, he, assembled, an, armada, to, retaliate, though, heavily, outnumbered, the, athenians, supported, by, their, plataean, allies, defeated, the, persian, hordes, at, the, battle, of, marathon, and, the, persian, fleet, turned, tail, ten, years, later, a, second, invasion, was, launched, by, darius, son, xerxes, the, city, states, of, northern, and, central, greece, submitted, to, the, persian, forces, without, resistance, but, a, coalition, of, 31, greek, city, states, including, athens, and, sparta, determined, to, resist, the, persian, invaders, at, the, same, time, greek, sicily, was, invaded, by, a, carthaginian, force, in, 480, bc, the, first, major, battle, of, the, invasion, was, fought, at, thermopylae, where, a, small, rearguard, of, greeks, led, by, three, hundred, spartans, held, a, crucial, pass, guarding, the, heart, of, greece, for, several, days, at, the, same, time, gelon, tyrant, of, syracuse, defeated, the, carthaginian, invasion, at, the, battle, of, himera, the, persians, were, decisively, defeated, at, sea, by, a, primarily, athenian, naval, force, at, the, battle, of, salamis, and, on, land, in, 479, bc, at, the, battle, of, plataea, the, alliance, against, persia, continued, initially, led, by, the, spartan, pausanias, but, from, 477, by, athens, and, by, 460, persia, had, been, driven, out, of, the, aegean, during, this, long, campaign, the, delian, league, gradually, transformed, from, a, defensive, alliance, of, greek, states, into, an, athenian, empire, as, athens, growing, naval, power, intimidated, the, other, league, states, athens, ended, its, campaigns, against, persia, in, 450, after, a, disastrous, defeat, in, egypt, in, 454, and, the, death, of, cimon, in, action, against, the, persians, on, cyprus, in, 450, as, the, athenian, fight, against, the, persian, empire, waned, conflict, grew, between, athens, and, sparta, suspicious, of, the, increasing, athenian, power, funded, by, the, delian, league, sparta, offered, aid, to, reluctant, members, of, the, league, to, rebel, against, athenian, domination, these, tensions, were, exacerbated, in, 462, bc, when, athens, sent, a, force, to, aid, sparta, in, overcoming, a, helot, revolt, but, this, aid, was, rejected, by, the, spartans, in, the, 450s, athens, took, control, of, boeotia, and, won, victories, over, aegina, and, corinth, however, athens, failed, to, win, a, decisive, victory, and, in, 447, lost, boeotia, again, athens, and, sparta, signed, the, thirty, years, peace, in, the, winter, of, 446, 5, ending, the, conflict, despite, the, treaty, athenian, relations, with, sparta, declined, again, in, the, 430s, and, in, 431, bc, the, peloponnesian, war, began, the, first, phase, of, the, war, saw, a, series, of, fruitless, annual, invasions, of, attica, by, sparta, while, athens, successfully, fought, the, corinthian, empire, in, northwest, greece, and, defended, its, own, empire, despite, a, plague, which, killed, the, leading, athenian, statesman, pericles, the, war, turned, after, athenian, victories, led, by, cleon, at, pylos, and, sphakteria, and, sparta, sued, for, peace, but, the, athenians, rejected, the, proposal, the, athenian, failure, to, regain, control, of, boeotia, at, delium, and, brasidas, successes, in, northern, greece, in, 424, improved, sparta, s, position, after, sphakteria, after, the, deaths, of, cleon, and, brasidas, the, strongest, proponents, of, war, on, each, side, a, peace, treaty, was, negoitiated, in, 421, by, the, athenian, general, nicias, the, peace, did, not, last, however, in, 418, bc, allied, forces, of, athens, and, argos, were, defeated, by, sparta, at, mantinea, in, 415, athens, launched, an, ambitious, naval, expedition, to, dominate, sicily, the, expedition, ended, in, disaster, at, the, harbor, of, syracuse, with, almost, the, entire, army, killed, and, the, ships, destroyed, soon, after, the, athenian, defeat, in, syracuse, athens, ionian, allies, began, to, rebel, against, the, delian, league, while, persia, began, to, once, again, involve, itself, in, greek, affairs, on, the, spartan, side, initially, the, athenian, position, continued, relatively, strong, with, important, victories, at, cyzicus, in, 410, and, arginusae, in, 406, however, in, 405, the, spartan, lysander, defeated, athens, in, the, battle, of, aegospotami, and, began, to, blockade, athens, harbour, driven, by, hunger, athens, sued, for, peace, agreeing, to, surrender, their, fleet, and, join, the, spartan, led, peloponnesian, league, following, the, athenian, surrender, sparta, installed, an, oligarchic, regime, the, thirty, tyrants, in, athens, one, of, a, number, of, spartan, backed, oligarchies, which, rose, to, power, after, the, peloponnesian, war, spartan, predominance, did, not, last, after, only, a, year, the, thirty, had, been, overthrown, the, first, half, of, the, fourth, century, saw, the, major, greek, states, attempt, to, dominate, the, mainland, none, were, successful, and, their, resulting, weakness, led, to, a, power, vacuum, which, would, eventually, be, filled, by, macedon, under, philip, ii, and, then, alexander, the, great, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, the, peloponnesian, war, sparta, attempted, to, extend, their, own, power, leading, argos, athens, corinth, and, thebes, to, join, against, them, aiming, to, prevent, any, single, greek, state, gaining, the, dominance, that, would, allow, it, to, challenge, persia, the, persian, king, initially, joined, the, alliance, against, sparta, before, imposing, the, peace, of, antalcidas, king, s, peace, which, restored, persia, s, control, over, the, anatolian, greeks, by, 371, bc, thebes, was, in, the, ascendancy, defeating, sparta, at, the, battle, of, leuctra, killing, the, spartan, king, cleombrotus, i, and, invading, laconia, further, theban, successes, against, sparta, in, 369, led, to, messenia, gaining, independence, sparta, never, recovered, from, the, loss, of, messenia, s, fertile, land, and, the, helot, workforce, it, provided, the, rising, power, of, thebes, led, sparta, and, athens, to, join, forces, in, 362, they, were, defeated, by, thebes, at, the, battle, of, mantinea, in, the, aftermath, of, mantinea, none, of, the, major, greek, states, were, able, to, dominate, though, thebes, had, won, the, battle, their, general, epaminondas, was, killed, and, they, spent, the, following, decades, embroiled, in, wars, with, their, neighbours, athens, meanwhile, saw, its, second, naval, alliance, formed, in, 377, collapse, in, the, mid, 350s, the, power, vacuum, in, greece, after, the, battle, of, mantinea, was, filled, by, macedon, under, philip, ii, in, 338, bc, he, defeated, a, greek, alliance, at, the, battle, of, chaeronea, and, subsequently, formed, the, league, of, corinth, philip, planned, to, lead, the, league, to, invade, persia, but, was, murdered, in, 336, bc, his, son, alexander, the, great, was, left, to, fulfil, his, father, s, ambitions, after, campaigns, against, macedon, s, western, and, northern, enemies, and, those, greek, states, that, had, broken, from, the, league, of, corinth, following, the, death, of, philip, alexander, began, his, campaign, against, persia, in, 334, bc, he, conquered, persia, defeating, darius, iii, at, the, battle, of, issus, in, 333, bc, and, after, the, battle, of, gaugamela, in, 331, bc, proclaimed, himself, king, of, asia, from, 329, bc, he, led, expeditions, to, bactria, and, then, india, further, plans, to, invade, arabia, and, north, africa, were, halted, by, his, death, in, 323, bc, the, period, from, the, death, of, alexander, the, great, in, 323, bc, until, the, death, of, cleopatra, the, last, macedonian, ruler, of, egypt, is, known, as, the, hellenistic, period, in, the, early, part, of, this, period, a, new, form, of, kingship, developed, based, on, macedonian, and, near, eastern, traditions, the, first, hellenistic, kings, were, previously, alexander, s, generals, and, took, power, in, the, period, following, his, death, though, they, were, not, part, of, existing, royal, lineages, and, lacked, historic, claims, to, the, territories, they, controlled, the, most, important, of, these, rulers, in, the, decades, after, alexander, s, death, were, antigonus, i, and, his, son, demetrius, in, macedonia, and, the, rest, of, greece, ptolemy, in, egypt, and, seleucus, i, in, syria, and, the, former, persian, empire, smaller, hellenistic, kingdoms, included, the, attalids, in, anatolia, and, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, in, the, early, part, of, the, hellenistic, period, the, exact, borders, of, the, hellenistic, kingdoms, were, not, settled, antigonus, attempted, to, expand, his, territory, by, attacking, the, other, successor, kingdoms, until, they, joined, against, him, and, he, was, killed, at, the, battle, of, ipsus, in, 301, bc, his, son, demetrius, spent, many, years, in, seleucid, captivity, and, his, son, antigonus, ii, only, reclaimed, the, macedonian, throne, around, 276, meanwhile, the, seleucid, kingdom, gave, up, territory, in, the, east, to, the, indian, king, chandragupta, maurya, in, exchange, for, war, elephants, and, later, lost, large, parts, of, persia, to, the, parthian, empire, by, the, mid, third, century, the, kingdoms, of, alexander, s, successors, was, mostly, stable, though, there, continued, to, be, disputes, over, border, areas, the, great, capitals, of, hellenistic, culture, were, alexandria, in, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, and, antioch, in, the, seleucid, empire, the, conquests, of, alexander, had, numerous, consequences, for, the, greek, city, states, it, greatly, widened, the, horizons, of, the, greeks, and, led, to, a, steady, emigration, of, the, young, and, ambitious, to, the, new, greek, empires, in, the, east, many, greeks, migrated, to, alexandria, antioch, and, the, many, other, new, hellenistic, cities, founded, in, alexander, s, wake, as, far, away, as, present, day, afghanistan, and, pakistan, where, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, and, the, indo, greek, kingdom, survived, until, the, end, of, the, first, century, bc, the, city, states, within, greece, formed, themselves, into, two, leagues, the, achaean, league, including, corinth, and, argos, and, the, aetolian, league, including, sparta, and, athens, for, much, of, the, period, until, the, roman, conquest, these, leagues, were, at, war, often, participating, in, the, conflicts, between, the, diadochi, the, successor, states, to, alexander, s, empire, the, antigonid, kingdom, became, involved, in, a, war, with, the, roman, republic, in, the, late, 3rd, century, although, the, first, macedonian, war, was, inconclusive, the, romans, in, typical, fashion, continued, to, fight, macedon, until, it, was, completely, absorbed, into, the, roman, republic, by, 149, bc, in, the, east, the, unwieldy, seleucid, empire, gradually, disintegrated, although, a, rump, survived, until, 64, bc, whilst, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, continued, in, egypt, until, 30, bc, when, it, too, was, conquered, by, the, romans, the, aetolian, league, grew, wary, of, roman, involvement, in, greece, and, sided, with, the, seleucids, in, the, roman, seleucid, war, when, the, romans, were, victorious, the, league, was, effectively, absorbed, into, the, republic, although, the, achaean, league, outlasted, both, the, aetolian, league, and, macedon, it, was, also, soon, defeated, and, absorbed, by, the, romans, in, 146, bc, bringing, greek, independence, to, an, end, the, greek, peninsula, came, under, roman, rule, during, the, 146, bc, conquest, of, greece, after, the, battle, of, corinth, macedonia, became, a, roman, province, while, southern, greece, came, under, the, surveillance, of, macedonia, s, prefect, however, some, greek, poleis, managed, to, maintain, a, partial, independence, and, avoid, taxation, the, aegean, islands, were, added, to, this, territory, in, 133, bc, athens, and, other, greek, cities, revolted, in, 88, bc, and, the, peninsula, was, crushed, by, the, roman, general, sulla, the, roman, civil, wars, devastated, the, land, even, further, until, augustus, organized, the, peninsula, as, the, province, of, achaea, in, 27, bc, greece, was, a, key, eastern, province, of, the, roman, empire, as, the, roman, culture, had, long, been, in, fact, greco, roman, the, greek, language, served, as, a, lingua, franca, in, the, east, and, in, italy, and, many, greek, intellectuals, such, as, galen, would, perform, most, of, their, work, in, rome, the, territory, of, greece, is, mountainous, and, as, a, result, ancient, greece, consisted, of, many, smaller, regions, each, with, its, own, dialect, cultural, peculiarities, and, identity, regionalism, and, regional, conflicts, were, prominent, features, of, ancient, greece, cities, tended, to, be, located, in, valleys, between, mountains, or, on, coastal, plains, and, dominated, a, certain, area, around, them, in, the, south, lay, the, peloponnese, consisting, of, the, regions, of, laconia, southeast, messenia, southwest, elis, west, achaia, north, korinthia, northeast, argolis, east, and, arcadia, center, these, names, survive, to, the, present, day, as, regional, units, of, modern, greece, though, with, somewhat, different, boundaries, mainland, greece, to, the, north, nowadays, known, as, central, greece, consisted, of, aetolia, and, acarnania, in, the, west, locris, doris, and, phocis, in, the, center, while, in, the, east, lay, boeotia, attica, and, megaris, northeast, lay, thessaly, while, epirus, lay, to, the, northwest, epirus, stretched, from, the, ambracian, gulf, in, the, south, to, the, ceraunian, mountains, and, the, aoos, river, in, the, north, and, consisted, of, chaonia, north, molossia, center, and, thesprotia, south, in, the, northeast, corner, was, macedonia, originally, consisting, lower, macedonia, and, its, regions, such, as, elimeia, pieria, and, orestis, around, the, time, of, alexander, i, of, macedon, the, argead, kings, of, macedon, started, to, expand, into, upper, macedonia, lands, inhabited, by, independent, macedonian, tribes, like, the, lyncestae, orestae, and, the, elimiotae, and, to, the, west, beyond, the, axius, river, into, eordaia, bottiaea, mygdonia, and, almopia, regions, settled, by, thracian, tribes, to, the, north, of, macedonia, lay, various, non, greek, peoples, such, as, the, paeonians, due, north, the, thracians, to, the, northeast, and, the, illyrians, with, whom, the, macedonians, were, frequently, in, conflict, to, the, northwest, chalcidice, was, settled, early, on, by, southern, greek, colonists, and, was, considered, part, of, the, greek, world, while, from, the, late, 2nd, millennium, bc, substantial, greek, settlement, also, occurred, on, the, eastern, shores, of, the, aegean, in, anatolia, during, the, archaic, period, the, greek, population, grew, beyond, the, capacity, of, the, limited, arable, land, of, greece, proper, resulting, in, the, large, scale, establishment, of, colonies, elsewhere, according, to, one, estimate, the, population, of, the, widening, area, of, greek, settlement, increased, roughly, tenfold, from, 800, bc, to, 400, bc, from, 800, 000, to, as, many, as, 7, 1, 2, 10, million, this, was, not, simply, for, trade, but, also, to, found, settlements, these, greek, colonies, were, not, as, roman, colonies, were, dependent, on, their, mother, city, but, were, independent, city, states, in, their, own, right, greeks, settled, outside, of, greece, in, two, distinct, ways, the, first, was, in, permanent, settlements, founded, by, greeks, which, formed, as, independent, poleis, the, second, form, was, in, what, historians, refer, to, as, emporia, trading, posts, which, were, occupied, by, both, greeks, and, non, greeks, and, which, were, primarily, concerned, with, the, manufacture, and, sale, of, goods, examples, of, this, latter, type, of, settlement, are, found, at, al, mina, in, the, east, and, pithekoussai, in, the, west, from, about, 750, bc, the, greeks, began, 250, years, of, expansion, settling, colonies, in, all, directions, to, the, east, the, aegean, coast, of, asia, minor, was, colonized, first, followed, by, cyprus, and, the, coasts, of, thrace, the, sea, of, marmara, and, south, coast, of, the, black, sea, eventually, greek, colonization, reached, as, far, northeast, as, present, day, ukraine, and, russia, taganrog, to, the, west, the, coasts, of, illyria, southern, italy, called, magna, graecia, were, settled, followed, by, southern, france, corsica, and, even, eastern, spain, greek, colonies, were, also, founded, in, egypt, and, libya, modern, syracuse, naples, marseille, and, istanbul, had, their, beginnings, as, the, greek, colonies, syracusae, neapolis, massalia, and, byzantion, these, colonies, played, an, important, role, in, the, spread, of, greek, influence, throughout, europe, and, also, aided, in, the, establishment, of, long, distance, trading, networks, between, the, greek, city, states, boosting, the, economy, of, ancient, greece, ancient, greece, consisted, of, several, hundred, relatively, independent, city, states, poleis, this, was, a, situation, unlike, that, in, most, other, contemporary, societies, which, were, either, tribal, or, kingdoms, ruling, over, relatively, large, territories, undoubtedly, the, geography, of, greece, divided, and, sub, divided, by, hills, mountains, and, rivers, contributed, to, the, fragmentary, nature, of, ancient, greece, on, the, one, hand, the, ancient, greeks, had, no, doubt, that, they, were, one, people, they, had, the, same, religion, same, basic, culture, and, same, language, furthermore, the, greeks, were, very, aware, of, their, tribal, origins, herodotus, was, able, to, extensively, categorise, the, city, states, by, tribe, yet, although, these, higher, level, relationships, existed, they, seem, to, have, rarely, had, a, major, role, in, greek, politics, the, independence, of, the, poleis, was, fiercely, defended, unification, was, something, rarely, contemplated, by, the, ancient, greeks, even, when, during, the, second, persian, invasion, of, greece, a, group, of, city, states, allied, themselves, to, defend, greece, the, vast, majority, of, poleis, remained, neutral, and, after, the, persian, defeat, the, allies, quickly, returned, to, infighting, thus, the, major, peculiarities, of, the, ancient, greek, political, system, were, its, fragmentary, nature, and, that, this, does, not, particularly, seem, to, have, tribal, origin, and, the, particular, focus, on, urban, centers, within, otherwise, tiny, states, the, peculiarities, of, the, greek, system, are, further, evidenced, by, the, colonies, that, they, set, up, throughout, the, mediterranean, which, though, they, might, count, a, certain, greek, polis, as, their, mother, and, remain, sympathetic, to, her, were, completely, independent, of, the, founding, city, inevitably, smaller, poleis, might, be, dominated, by, larger, neighbors, but, conquest, or, direct, rule, by, another, city, state, appears, to, have, been, quite, rare, instead, the, poleis, grouped, themselves, into, leagues, membership, of, which, was, in, a, constant, state, of, flux, later, in, the, classical, period, the, leagues, would, become, fewer, and, larger, be, dominated, by, one, city, particularly, athens, sparta, and, thebes, and, often, poleis, would, be, compelled, to, join, under, threat, of, war, or, as, part, of, a, peace, treaty, even, after, philip, ii, of, macedon, conquered, the, heartlands, of, ancient, greece, he, did, not, attempt, to, annex, the, territory, or, unify, it, into, a, new, province, but, compelled, most, of, the, poleis, to, join, his, own, corinthian, league, initially, many, greek, city, states, seem, to, have, been, petty, kingdoms, there, was, often, a, city, official, carrying, some, residual, ceremonial, functions, of, the, king, basileus, e, g, the, archon, basileus, in, athens, however, by, the, archaic, period, and, the, first, historical, consciousness, most, had, already, become, aristocratic, oligarchies, it, is, unclear, exactly, how, this, change, occurred, for, instance, in, athens, the, kingship, had, been, reduced, to, a, hereditary, lifelong, chief, magistracy, archon, by, c, 1050, bc, by, 753, bc, this, had, become, a, decennial, elected, archonship, and, finally, by, 683, bc, an, annually, elected, archonship, through, each, stage, more, power, would, have, been, transferred, to, the, aristocracy, as, a, whole, and, away, from, a, single, individual, inevitably, the, domination, of, politics, and, concomitant, aggregation, of, wealth, by, small, groups, of, families, was, apt, to, cause, social, unrest, in, many, poleis, in, many, cities, a, tyrant, not, in, the, modern, sense, of, repressive, autocracies, would, at, some, point, seize, control, and, govern, according, to, their, own, will, often, a, populist, agenda, would, help, sustain, them, in, power, in, a, system, wracked, with, class, conflict, government, by, a, strongman, was, often, the, best, solution, athens, fell, under, a, tyranny, in, the, second, half, of, the, 6th, century, bc, when, this, tyranny, was, ended, the, athenians, founded, the, world, s, first, democracy, as, a, radical, solution, to, prevent, the, aristocracy, regaining, power, a, citizens, assembly, the, ecclesia, for, the, discussion, of, city, policy, had, existed, since, the, reforms, of, draco, in, 621, bc, all, citizens, were, permitted, to, attend, after, the, reforms, of, solon, early, 6th, century, but, the, poorest, citizens, could, not, address, the, assembly, or, run, for, office, with, the, establishment, of, the, democracy, the, assembly, became, the, de, jure, mechanism, of, government, all, citizens, had, equal, privileges, in, the, assembly, however, non, citizens, such, as, metics, foreigners, living, in, athens, or, slaves, had, no, political, rights, at, all, after, the, rise, of, democracy, in, athens, other, city, states, founded, democracies, however, many, retained, more, traditional, forms, of, government, as, so, often, in, other, matters, sparta, was, a, notable, exception, to, the, rest, of, greece, ruled, through, the, whole, period, by, not, one, but, two, hereditary, monarchs, this, was, a, form, of, diarchy, the, kings, of, sparta, belonged, to, the, agiads, and, the, eurypontids, descendants, respectively, of, eurysthenes, and, procles, both, dynasties, founders, were, believed, to, be, twin, sons, of, aristodemus, a, heraclid, ruler, however, the, powers, of, these, kings, were, held, in, check, by, both, a, council, of, elders, the, gerousia, and, magistrates, specifically, appointed, to, watch, over, the, kings, the, ephors, only, free, land, owning, native, born, men, could, be, citizens, entitled, to, the, full, protection, of, the, law, in, a, city, state, in, most, city, states, unlike, the, situation, in, rome, social, prominence, did, not, allow, special, rights, sometimes, families, controlled, public, religious, functions, but, this, ordinarily, did, not, give, any, extra, power, in, the, government, in, athens, the, population, was, divided, into, four, social, classes, based, on, wealth, people, could, change, classes, if, they, made, more, money, in, sparta, all, male, citizens, were, called, homoioi, meaning, peers, however, spartan, kings, who, served, as, the, city, state, s, dual, military, and, religious, leaders, came, from, two, families, slaves, had, no, power, or, status, slaves, had, the, right, to, have, a, family, and, own, property, subject, to, their, master, s, goodwill, and, permission, but, they, had, no, political, rights, by, 600, bc, chattel, slavery, had, spread, in, greece, by, the, 5th, century, bc, slaves, made, up, one, third, of, the, total, population, in, some, city, states, between, 40, 80, of, the, population, of, classical, athens, were, slaves, slaves, outside, of, sparta, almost, never, revolted, because, they, were, made, up, of, too, many, nationalities, and, were, too, scattered, to, organize, however, unlike, later, western, culture, the, ancient, greeks, did, not, think, in, terms, of, race, most, families, owned, slaves, as, household, servants, and, laborers, and, even, poor, families, might, have, owned, a, few, slaves, owners, were, not, allowed, to, beat, or, kill, their, slaves, owners, often, promised, to, free, slaves, in, the, future, to, encourage, slaves, to, work, hard, unlike, in, rome, freedmen, did, not, become, citizens, instead, they, were, mixed, into, the, population, of, metics, which, included, people, from, foreign, countries, or, other, city, states, who, were, officially, allowed, to, live, in, the, state, city, states, legally, owned, slaves, these, public, slaves, had, a, larger, measure, of, independence, than, slaves, owned, by, families, living, on, their, own, and, performing, specialized, tasks, in, athens, public, slaves, were, trained, to, look, out, for, counterfeit, coinage, while, temple, slaves, acted, as, servants, of, the, temple, s, deity, and, scythian, slaves, were, employed, in, athens, as, a, police, force, corralling, citizens, to, political, functions, sparta, had, a, special, type, of, slaves, called, helots, helots, were, messenians, enslaved, en, masse, during, the, messenian, wars, by, the, state, and, assigned, to, families, where, they, were, forced, to, stay, helots, raised, food, and, did, household, chores, so, that, women, could, concentrate, on, raising, strong, children, while, men, could, devote, their, time, to, training, as, hoplites, their, masters, treated, them, harshly, and, helots, revolted, against, their, masters, several, times, in, 370, 69, bc, as, a, result, of, epaminondas, liberation, of, messenia, from, spartan, rule, the, helot, system, there, came, to, an, end, and, the, helots, won, their, freedom, however, it, did, continue, to, persist, in, laconia, until, the, 2nd, century, bc, for, most, of, greek, history, education, was, private, except, in, sparta, during, the, hellenistic, period, some, city, states, established, public, schools, only, wealthy, families, could, afford, a, teacher, boys, learned, how, to, read, write, and, quote, literature, they, also, learned, to, sing, and, play, one, musical, instrument, and, were, trained, as, athletes, for, military, service, they, studied, not, for, a, job, but, to, become, an, effective, citizen, girls, also, learned, to, read, write, and, do, simple, arithmetic, so, they, could, manage, the, household, they, almost, never, received, education, after, childhood, boys, went, to, school, at, the, age, of, seven, or, went, to, the, barracks, if, they, lived, in, sparta, the, three, types, of, teachings, were, grammatistes, for, arithmetic, kitharistes, for, music, and, dancing, and, paedotribae, for, sports, boys, from, wealthy, families, attending, the, private, school, lessons, were, taken, care, of, by, a, paidagogos, a, household, slave, selected, for, this, task, who, accompanied, the, boy, during, the, day, classes, were, held, in, teachers, private, houses, and, included, reading, writing, mathematics, singing, and, playing, the, lyre, and, flute, when, the, boy, became, 12, years, old, the, schooling, started, to, include, sports, such, as, wrestling, running, and, throwing, discus, and, javelin, in, athens, some, older, youths, attended, academy, for, the, finer, disciplines, such, as, culture, sciences, music, and, the, arts, the, schooling, ended, at, age, 18, followed, by, military, training, in, the, army, usually, for, one, or, two, years, some, of, athens, greatest, such, schools, included, the, lyceum, the, so, called, peripatetic, school, founded, by, aristotle, of, stageira, and, the, platonic, academy, founded, by, plato, of, athens, the, education, system, of, the, wealthy, ancient, greeks, is, also, called, paideia, at, its, economic, height, in, the, 5th, and, 4th, centuries, bc, the, free, citizenry, of, classical, greece, represented, perhaps, the, most, prosperous, society, in, the, ancient, world, some, economic, historians, considering, greece, one, of, the, most, advanced, pre, industrial, economies, in, terms, of, wheat, wages, reached, an, estimated, 7, 12, kg, daily, for, an, unskilled, worker, in, urban, athens, 2, 3, times, the, 3, 75, kg, of, an, unskilled, rural, labourer, in, roman, egypt, though, greek, farm, incomes, too, were, on, average, lower, than, those, available, to, urban, workers, while, slave, conditions, varied, widely, the, institution, served, to, sustain, the, incomes, of, the, free, citizenry, an, estimate, of, economic, development, drawn, from, the, latter, or, derived, from, urban, incomes, alone, is, therefore, likely, to, overstate, the, true, overall, level, despite, widespread, evidence, for, high, living, standards, at, least, in, the, archaic, period, the, fragmentary, nature, of, ancient, greece, with, many, competing, city, states, increased, the, frequency, of, conflict, but, conversely, limited, the, scale, of, warfare, unable, to, maintain, professional, armies, the, city, states, relied, on, their, own, citizens, to, fight, this, inevitably, reduced, the, potential, duration, of, campaigns, as, citizens, would, need, to, return, to, their, own, professions, especially, in, the, case, of, for, example, farmers, campaigns, would, therefore, often, be, restricted, to, summer, when, battles, occurred, they, were, usually, set, piece, and, intended, to, be, decisive, casualties, were, slight, compared, to, later, battles, rarely, amounting, to, more, than, five, percent, of, the, losing, side, but, the, slain, often, included, the, most, prominent, citizens, and, generals, who, led, from, the, front, the, scale, and, scope, of, warfare, in, ancient, greece, changed, dramatically, as, a, result, of, the, greco, persian, wars, to, fight, the, enormous, armies, of, the, achaemenid, empire, was, effectively, beyond, the, capabilities, of, a, single, city, state, the, eventual, triumph, of, the, greeks, was, achieved, by, alliances, of, city, states, the, exact, composition, changing, over, time, allowing, the, pooling, of, resources, and, division, of, labor, although, alliances, between, city, states, occurred, before, this, time, nothing, on, this, scale, had, been, seen, before, the, rise, of, athens, and, sparta, as, pre, eminent, powers, during, this, conflict, led, directly, to, the, peloponnesian, war, which, saw, further, development, of, the, nature, of, warfare, strategy, and, tactics, fought, between, leagues, of, cities, dominated, by, athens, and, sparta, the, increased, manpower, and, financial, resources, increased, the, scale, and, allowed, the, diversification, of, warfare, set, piece, battles, during, the, peloponnesian, war, proved, indecisive, and, instead, there, was, increased, reliance, on, attritionary, strategies, naval, battles, and, blockades, and, sieges, these, changes, greatly, increased, the, number, of, casualties, and, the, disruption, of, greek, society, athens, owned, one, of, the, largest, war, fleets, in, ancient, greece, it, had, over, 200, triremes, each, powered, by, 170, oarsmen, who, were, seated, in, 3, rows, on, each, side, of, the, ship, the, city, could, afford, such, a, large, fleet, it, had, over, 34, 000, oarsmen, because, it, owned, a, lot, of, silver, mines, that, were, worked, by, slaves, according, to, josiah, ober, greek, city, states, faced, approximately, a, one, in, three, chance, of, destruction, during, the, archaic, and, classical, period, ancient, greek, philosophy, focused, on, the, role, of, reason, and, inquiry, in, many, ways, it, had, an, important, influence, on, modern, philosophy, as, well, as, modern, science, clear, unbroken, lines, of, influence, lead, from, ancient, greek, and, hellenistic, philosophers, to, medieval, muslim, philosophers, and, islamic, scientists, to, the, european, renaissance, and, enlightenment, to, the, secular, sciences, of, the, modern, day, neither, reason, nor, inquiry, began, with, the, ancient, greeks, defining, the, difference, between, the, greek, quest, for, knowledge, and, the, quests, of, the, elder, civilizations, such, as, the, ancient, egyptians, and, babylonians, has, long, been, a, topic, of, study, by, theorists, of, civilization, the, first, known, philosophers, of, greece, were, the, pre, socratics, who, attempted, to, provide, naturalistic, non, mythical, descriptions, of, the, world, they, were, followed, by, socrates, one, of, the, first, philosophers, based, in, athens, during, its, golden, age, whose, ideas, despite, being, known, by, second, hand, accounts, instead, of, writings, of, his, own, laid, the, basis, of, western, philosophy, socrates, disciple, plato, who, wrote, the, republic, and, established, a, radical, difference, between, ideas, and, the, concrete, world, and, plato, s, disciple, aristotle, who, wrote, extensively, about, nature, and, ethics, are, also, immensely, influential, in, western, philosophy, to, this, day, the, later, hellenistic, philosophy, also, originating, in, greece, is, defined, by, names, such, as, antisthenes, cynicism, zeno, of, citium, stoicism, and, plotinus, neoplatonism, the, earliest, greek, literature, was, poetry, and, was, composed, for, performance, rather, than, private, consumption, the, earliest, greek, poet, known, is, homer, although, he, was, certainly, part, of, an, existing, tradition, of, oral, poetry, homer, s, poetry, though, it, was, developed, around, the, same, time, that, the, greeks, developed, writing, would, have, been, composed, orally, the, first, poet, to, certainly, compose, their, work, in, writing, was, archilochus, a, lyric, poet, from, the, mid, seventh, century, bc, tragedy, developed, around, the, end, of, the, archaic, period, taking, elements, from, across, the, pre, existing, genres, of, late, archaic, poetry, towards, the, beginning, of, the, classical, period, comedy, began, to, develop, the, earliest, date, associated, with, the, genre, is, 486, bc, when, a, competition, for, comedy, became, an, official, event, at, the, city, dionysia, in, athens, though, the, first, preserved, ancient, comedy, is, aristophanes, acharnians, produced, in, 425, like, poetry, greek, prose, had, its, origins, in, the, archaic, period, and, the, earliest, writers, of, greek, philosophy, history, and, medical, literature, all, date, to, the, sixth, century, bc, prose, first, emerged, as, the, writing, style, adopted, by, the, presocratic, philosophers, anaximander, and, anaximenes, though, thales, of, miletus, considered, the, first, greek, philosopher, apparently, wrote, nothing, prose, as, a, genre, reached, maturity, in, the, classical, era, and, the, major, greek, prose, genres, philosophy, history, rhetoric, and, dialogue, developed, in, this, period, the, hellenistic, period, saw, the, literary, centre, of, the, greek, world, move, from, athens, where, it, had, been, in, the, classical, period, to, alexandria, at, the, same, time, other, hellenistic, kings, such, as, the, antigonids, and, the, attalids, were, patrons, of, scholarship, and, literature, turning, pella, and, pergamon, respectively, into, cultural, centres, it, was, thanks, to, this, cultural, patronage, by, hellenistic, kings, and, especially, the, museum, at, alexandria, that, so, much, ancient, greek, literature, has, survived, the, library, of, alexandria, part, of, the, museum, had, the, previously, unenvisaged, aim, of, collecting, together, copies, of, all, known, authors, in, greek, almost, all, of, the, surviving, non, technical, hellenistic, literature, is, poetry, and, hellenistic, poetry, tended, to, be, highly, intellectual, blending, different, genres, and, traditions, and, avoiding, linear, narratives, the, hellenistic, period, also, saw, a, shift, in, the, ways, literature, was, consumed, while, in, the, archaic, and, classical, periods, literature, had, typically, been, experienced, in, public, performance, in, the, hellenistic, period, it, was, more, commonly, read, privately, at, the, same, time, hellenistic, poets, began, to, write, for, private, rather, than, public, consumption, with, octavian, s, victory, at, actium, in, 31, bc, rome, began, to, become, a, major, centre, of, greek, literature, as, important, greek, authors, such, as, strabo, and, dionysius, of, halicarnassus, came, to, rome, the, period, of, greatest, innovation, in, greek, literature, under, rome, was, the, long, second, century, from, approximately, 80, ad, to, around, 230, ad, this, innovation, was, especially, marked, in, prose, with, the, development, of, the, novel, and, a, revival, of, prominence, for, display, oratory, both, dating, to, this, period, in, ancient, greek, society, music, was, ever, present, and, considered, a, fundamental, component, of, civilisation, it, was, an, important, part, of, public, religious, worship, private, ceremonies, such, as, weddings, and, funerals, and, household, entertainment, men, sang, and, played, music, at, the, symposium, both, men, and, women, sang, at, work, and, children, s, games, involved, song, and, dance, ancient, greek, music, was, primarily, vocal, sung, either, by, a, solo, singer, or, a, chorus, and, usually, accompanied, by, an, instrument, purely, instrumental, music, was, less, common, the, greeks, used, stringed, instruments, including, lyres, harps, and, lutes, and, wind, instruments, of, which, the, most, important, was, the, aulos, a, reed, instrument, percussion, instruments, played, a, relatively, unimportant, role, supporting, stringed, and, wind, instruments, and, were, used, in, certain, religious, cults, ancient, greek, mathematics, contributed, many, important, developments, to, the, field, of, mathematics, including, the, basic, rules, of, geometry, the, idea, of, formal, mathematical, proof, and, discoveries, in, number, theory, mathematical, analysis, applied, mathematics, and, approached, close, to, establishing, integral, calculus, the, discoveries, of, several, greek, mathematicians, including, pythagoras, euclid, and, archimedes, are, still, used, in, mathematical, teaching, today, the, greeks, developed, astronomy, which, they, treated, as, a, branch, of, mathematics, to, a, highly, sophisticated, level, the, first, geometrical, three, dimensional, models, to, explain, the, apparent, motion, of, the, planets, were, developed, in, the, 4th, century, bc, by, eudoxus, of, cnidus, and, callippus, of, cyzicus, their, younger, contemporary, heraclides, ponticus, proposed, that, the, earth, rotates, around, its, axis, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, aristarchus, of, samos, was, the, first, to, suggest, a, heliocentric, system, archimedes, in, his, treatise, the, sand, reckoner, revives, aristarchus, hypothesis, that, the, fixed, stars, and, the, sun, remain, unmoved, while, the, earth, revolves, about, the, sun, on, the, circumference, of, a, circle, otherwise, only, fragmentary, descriptions, of, aristarchus, idea, survive, eratosthenes, using, the, angles, of, shadows, created, at, widely, separated, regions, estimated, the, circumference, of, the, earth, with, great, accuracy, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, hipparchus, of, nicea, made, a, number, of, contributions, including, the, first, measurement, of, precession, and, the, compilation, of, the, first, star, catalog, in, which, he, proposed, the, modern, system, of, apparent, magnitudes, the, antikythera, mechanism, a, device, for, calculating, the, movements, of, planets, dates, from, about, 80, bc, and, was, the, first, ancestor, of, the, astronomical, computer, it, was, discovered, in, an, ancient, shipwreck, off, the, greek, island, of, antikythera, between, kythera, and, crete, the, device, became, famous, for, its, use, of, a, differential, gear, previously, believed, to, have, been, invented, in, the, 16th, century, and, the, miniaturization, and, complexity, of, its, parts, comparable, to, a, clock, made, in, the, 18th, century, the, original, mechanism, is, displayed, in, the, bronze, collection, of, the, national, archaeological, museum, of, athens, accompanied, by, a, replica, the, ancient, greeks, also, made, important, discoveries, in, the, medical, field, hippocrates, was, a, physician, of, the, classical, period, and, is, considered, one, of, the, most, outstanding, figures, in, the, history, of, medicine, he, is, referred, to, as, the, father, of, medicine, in, recognition, of, his, lasting, contributions, to, the, field, as, the, founder, of, the, hippocratic, school, of, medicine, this, intellectual, school, revolutionized, medicine, in, ancient, greece, establishing, it, as, a, discipline, distinct, from, other, fields, that, it, had, traditionally, been, associated, with, notably, theurgy, and, philosophy, thus, making, medicine, a, profession, the, art, of, ancient, greece, has, exercised, an, enormous, influence, on, the, culture, of, many, countries, from, ancient, times, to, the, present, day, particularly, in, the, areas, of, sculpture, and, architecture, in, the, west, the, art, of, the, roman, empire, was, largely, derived, from, greek, models, in, the, east, alexander, the, great, s, conquests, initiated, several, centuries, of, exchange, between, greek, central, asian, and, indian, cultures, resulting, in, greco, buddhist, art, with, ramifications, as, far, as, japan, following, the, renaissance, in, europe, the, humanist, aesthetic, and, the, high, technical, standards, of, greek, art, inspired, generations, of, european, artists, well, into, the, 19th, century, the, classical, tradition, derived, from, greece, dominated, the, art, of,
