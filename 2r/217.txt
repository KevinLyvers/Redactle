the, ghana, empire, arabic, also, known, as, simply, ghana, ghanata, or, wagadu, was, a, west, african, classical, to, post, classical, era, western, sahelian, empire, based, in, the, modern, day, southeast, of, mauritania, and, western, mali, it, is, uncertain, among, historians, when, ghana, s, ruling, dynasty, began, the, first, identifiable, mention, of, the, imperial, dynasty, in, written, records, was, made, by, mu, ammad, ibn, m, s, al, khw, rizm, in, 830, further, information, about, the, empire, was, provided, by, the, accounts, of, cordoban, scholar, al, bakri, when, he, wrote, about, the, region, in, the, 11th, century, after, centuries, of, prosperity, the, empire, began, its, decline, in, the, second, millennium, and, would, finally, become, a, vassal, state, of, the, rising, mali, empire, at, some, point, in, the, 13th, century, despite, its, collapse, the, empire, s, influence, can, be, felt, in, the, establishment, of, numerous, urban, centers, throughout, its, former, territory, in, 1957, the, british, colony, of, the, gold, coast, under, the, leadership, of, kwame, nkrumah, named, itself, ghana, upon, independence, the, word, ghana, means, warrior, or, war, chief, and, was, the, title, given, to, the, rulers, of, the, kingdom, kaya, maghan, king, of, gold, was, another, title, for, these, kings, the, soninke, name, for, the, polity, was, ouagadou, this, meant, the, place, of, the, wague, the, term, current, in, the, 19th, century, for, the, local, nobility, or, may, have, meant, the, land, of, great, herds, according, to, oral, traditions, although, they, vary, much, amongst, themselves, the, legendary, progenitory, of, the, soninke, was, a, man, named, dinga, who, came, from, the, east, possibly, aswan, egypt, after, which, he, migrated, to, a, variety, of, locations, in, western, sudan, in, each, place, leaving, children, by, different, wives, in, order, to, take, power, he, had, to, kill, a, serpent, deity, named, bida, and, then, marry, his, daughters, who, became, the, ancestors, of, the, clans, that, were, dominant, in, the, region, at, the, time, some, traditions, state, he, did, a, deal, with, bida, to, sacrifice, one, maiden, a, year, in, exchange, for, rainfall, and, other, versions, add, a, constant, supply, of, gold, 55, upon, dinga, s, death, his, two, sons, khine, and, dyabe, contested, the, kingship, and, dyabe, was, victorious, founding, wagadu, in, some, versions, the, fall, of, wagadu, happens, when, a, nobleman, tries, to, save, a, maiden, despite, her, objection, and, kills, the, snake, unleashing, its, curse, and, annulling, the, prior, deal, this, tale, appears, to, have, been, a, fragment, of, what, once, was, a, much, longer, narrative, now, lost, however, the, legend, of, wagadu, continues, to, have, a, deep, rooted, significance, in, soninke, culture, and, history, 54, 55, the, tradition, of, gassire, s, lute, mentions, wagadu, s, fall, the, traditions, of, the, moors, hassaniya, arabs, and, berbers, in, mauritania, maintain, that, the, earliest, occupants, of, areas, such, as, the, adrar, and, tagant, were, black, these, regions, part, of, the, core, of, wagadu, remained, largely, soninke, until, at, least, the, 16th, century, the, earliest, discussions, of, ghana, s, origins, are, found, in, the, sudanese, chronicles, of, mahmud, kati, the, tarikh, al, fattash, and, abd, al, rahman, as, sadi, the, tarikh, al, sudan, addressing, the, rulers, origin, the, tarikh, al, fattash, offers, three, different, theories, that, they, were, soninke, or, wangara, a, soninke, mande, group, which, the, author, considered, improbable, or, that, they, were, sanhaja, berbers, which, the, author, considered, most, likely, the, author, concludes, that, the, nearest, to, the, truth, is, that, they, were, not, black, this, interpretation, derived, from, his, opinion, that, the, rulers, genealogies, linked, them, to, the, berbers, the, tarikh, al, sudan, further, states, that, in, origin, they, were, white, though, we, do, not, know, to, whom, they, trace, their, origin, their, subjects, however, were, wa, kore, chronicles, by, al, idrisi, in, the, 11th, century, and, ibn, said, in, the, 13th, noted, that, rulers, of, ghana, traced, their, descent, from, the, clan, of, muhammad, either, through, his, protector, abi, talib, or, through, his, son, in, law, ali, french, colonial, officials, notably, maurice, delafosse, erroneously, concluded, that, ghana, had, been, founded, by, the, berbers, and, linked, them, to, north, african, and, middle, eastern, origins, delafosse, produced, a, convoluted, theory, of, an, invasion, by, judeo, syrians, which, he, linked, to, the, fulbe, who, actually, co, founded, takrur, this, idea, of, a, foreign, origin, for, wagadu, is, generally, disregarded, by, modern, scholars, levtzion, and, spaulding, for, example, argue, that, al, idrisi, s, testimony, should, be, looked, at, skeptically, due, to, serious, miscalculations, in, geography, and, historical, chronology, the, archaeologist, and, historian, raymond, mauny, argues, that, al, kati, s, and, al, saadi, s, theories, were, based, on, the, presence, after, ghana, s, demise, of, nomadic, berbers, originally, from, libya, and, the, assumption, that, they, were, the, ruling, caste, in, an, earlier, age, earlier, accounts, such, ya, qubi, 872, ce, al, masudi, c, 944, ce, ibn, hawqal, 977, ce, al, biruni, c, 1036, ce, and, al, bakri, 1068, ce, all, describe, the, population, and, rulers, of, ghana, as, negroes, delafosse, s, works, meanwhile, have, been, harshly, criticised, by, scholars, such, as, charles, monteil, robert, cornevin, and, others, for, being, unacceptable, and, too, creative, to, be, useful, to, historians, particularly, in, relation, to, his, interpretation, of, west, african, genealogies, beginning, in, the, mid, 20th, century, as, more, archeological, data, became, available, scholars, began, to, favor, a, purely, local, origin, for, ghana, these, works, bring, together, archaeology, descriptive, geographical, sources, written, between, 830, and, 1400, ad, the, tarikhs, from, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, and, the, oral, traditions, in, 1969, patrick, munson, excavated, at, dhar, tichitt, a, site, associated, with, the, ancestors, of, the, soninke, which, clearly, reflected, a, complex, culture, that, was, present, by, 1600, bc, and, had, architectural, and, material, cultural, elements, similar, to, those, found, at, koumbi, saleh, in, the, 1920s, the, earliest, proto, polity, ancestral, to, ghana, likely, arose, from, a, large, collection, of, ancient, proto, mande, agro, pastoralist, chiefdoms, that, were, spread, over, the, western, most, portion, of, the, niger, river, basin, for, over, a, millennium, roughly, spanning, 1300, bce, 300, bce, munsun, theorized, that, around, 700, bce, libyco, berbers, raiders, destroyed, this, burgeoning, state, their, opening, of, a, trade, route, north, however, eventually, changed, the, economic, calculus, from, raiding, to, trade, and, the, native, soninke, reasserted, themselves, around, 300, bce, this, trade, and, the, development, of, ironworking, technology, were, crucial, in, the, formation, of, the, state, work, in, dhar, tichitt, dhar, nema, and, dhar, walata, has, shown, that, as, the, desert, advanced, the, local, groups, moved, southward, into, the, still, well, watered, areas, of, what, is, now, northern, mali, historian, dierk, lange, has, argued, that, the, core, of, wagadou, was, not, koumbi, saleh, but, in, fact, lay, near, lake, faguibine, on, the, niger, bend, this, area, was, historically, more, fertile, than, the, tichitt, zone, and, lange, draws, on, oral, traditions, to, support, his, argument, contending, that, dynastic, struggles, in, the, 11th, century, pushed, the, capital, west, towards, the, end, of, the, 3rd, century, ad, a, wet, period, in, the, sahel, created, areas, for, human, habitation, and, exploitation, which, had, not, been, habitable, for, the, best, part, of, a, millennium, resulting, in, wagadu, rising, out, of, the, tichitt, culture, the, introduction, of, the, camel, to, the, western, sahara, in, the, 3rd, century, ad, and, pressure, from, the, nomadic, saharan, sanhaja, served, as, major, catalysts, for, the, transformative, social, changes, that, resulted, in, the, empire, s, formation, by, the, time, of, the, muslim, conquest, of, north, africa, in, the, 7th, century, the, camel, had, changed, the, ancient, irregular, trade, routes, into, a, network, running, between, north, africa, and, the, niger, river, soninke, tradition, portrays, early, ghana, as, very, warlike, with, horse, mounted, warriors, key, to, increasing, its, territory, and, population, although, details, of, their, expansion, are, extremely, scarce, wagadu, made, its, profits, from, maintaining, a, monopoly, on, gold, heading, north, and, salt, heading, south, despite, not, controlling, the, gold, fields, themselves, it, is, possible, that, wagadu, s, dominance, on, trade, allowed, for, the, gradual, consolidation, of, many, smaller, polities, into, a, confederated, state, whose, composites, stood, in, varying, relations, to, the, core, from, fully, administered, to, nominal, tribute, paying, parity, based, on, large, tumuli, scattered, across, west, africa, dating, to, this, period, it, has, been, stipulated, that, relative, to, wagadu, there, were, many, more, simultaneous, and, preceding, kingdoms, which, have, unfortunately, been, lost, to, time, information, about, the, empire, at, its, height, is, sparse, according, to, kati, s, tarikh, al, fettash, in, a, section, probably, composed, around, 1580, but, citing, the, chief, judge, ida, al, massini, who, lived, somewhat, earlier, twenty, kings, ruled, ghana, before, the, advent, of, islam, al, sadi, purports, that, approximately, 18, through, 34, ancient, kaya, kings, ruled, before, the, hijra, and, 24, more, kaya, kings, ruled, afterward, written, sources, vague, as, to, the, empire, s, maximum, extent, though, according, to, al, bakri, ghana, had, forced, awdaghost, in, the, desert, to, accept, its, rule, sometime, between, 970, and, 1054, oral, traditions, indicate, that, at, its, height, the, empire, controlled, takrur, jafunu, jaara, bakhunu, neema, soso, guidimakha, gijume, gajaaga, as, well, as, the, awker, adrar, and, hodh, to, the, north, it, also, had, some, degree, of, influence, over, kaniaga, kaarta, and, khasso, diabe, supposedly, the, son, of, dinga, is, sometimes, given, credit, for, driving, the, mandinka, out, of, the, gajaaga, two, other, soninke, groups, to, the, south, the, gaja, and, the, karo, were, dominated, by, the, wagu, given, the, scattered, nature, of, the, arabic, sources, and, the, ambiguity, of, the, existing, archaeological, record, it, is, difficult, to, determine, when, and, how, ghana, declined, with, the, gradual, drying, of, the, sahel, the, all, important, epicenters, of, trade, began, to, most, south, to, the, niger, river, and, west, to, the, senegal, this, gradually, strengthened, ghana, s, vassals, while, weakening, the, core, awdaghost, at, the, time, a, seat, of, the, king, fell, to, the, almoravids, in, 1054, ghana, bassi, died, in, 1063, and, was, succeeded, by, his, nephew, tunka, manin, this, may, have, created, a, succession, dispute, with, bassi, s, son, qanamar, providing, an, opportunity, for, the, almoravids, to, intervene, in, the, empire, promoting, pro, islam, candidates, for, the, throne, a, tradition, in, historiography, maintains, that, ghana, was, conquered, by, the, almoravid, dynasty, in, 1076, 77, but, this, interpretation, has, been, sharply, questioned, by, modern, scholars, conrad, and, fisher, 1982, argued, that, the, notion, of, any, almoravid, military, conquest, at, its, core, is, merely, perpetuated, folklore, derived, from, a, misinterpretation, or, naive, reliance, on, arabic, sources, dierke, lange, agrees, but, argues, that, this, does, not, preclude, almoravid, political, agitation, claiming, that, ghana, s, demise, owed, much, to, the, latter, furthermore, the, archaeology, of, ancient, ghana, does, not, show, the, signs, of, rapid, change, and, destruction, that, would, be, associated, with, any, almoravid, era, military, conquests, sheryl, l, burkhalter, 1992, suggested, that, there, were, reasons, to, believe, that, there, was, conflict, between, the, almoravids, and, the, empire, of, ghana, ibn, khaldun, a, 14th, century, north, african, historian, who, read, and, cited, both, al, bakri, and, al, idrisi, reported, an, ambiguous, account, of, the, country, s, history, as, related, to, him, by, uthman, a, faqih, of, ghana, who, took, a, pilgrimage, to, mecca, in, 1394, according, to, which, the, power, of, ghana, waned, as, that, of, the, veiled, people, grew, through, the, almoravid, movement, whether, the, almoravids, conquered, ghana, or, not, the, country, certainly, did, convert, to, islam, around, 1076, this, conversion, and, its, accompanying, rejection, of, the, earlier, more, accommodating, islam, may, have, pushed, the, wangara, diaspora, throughout, the, region, in, 1083, supported, by, the, almoravids, ghana, attacked, tadmekka, and, may, have, reached, gao, helping, to, spread, sunni, orthodoxy, there, as, well, al, idrisi, whose, account, was, written, in, 1154, has, the, country, fully, muslim, by, that, date, he, describes, an, empire, as, powerful, as, it, had, been, in, the, days, of, al, bakri, 75, years, earlier, in, fact, he, describes, its, capital, as, the, greatest, of, all, towns, of, the, sudan, with, respect, to, area, the, most, populous, and, with, the, most, extensive, trade, this, capital, may, not, be, the, same, city, as, the, one, described, by, al, bakri, however, in, this, period, the, ruling, dynasty, now, thoroughly, islamized, re, established, control, over, many, of, the, former, vassals, who, had, become, independent, including, kaniaga, diarra, diafunu, and, others, ghana, was, the, master, of, an, extensive, trade, system, in, the, senegal, river, valley, first, established, by, takrur, in, the, 10th, century, that, exported, salt, from, awlil, throughout, the, region, it, also, controlled, the, gold, mines, of, bambuk, during, this, period, ghana, was, fully, islamized, and, the, judicial, system, had, shifted, to, something, more, closely, resembling, sharia, this, resurgence, did, not, last, however, by, 1203, the, sosso, rose, against, their, masters, and, conquered, ghana, oral, historians, link, the, coming, of, islam, to, the, final, end, of, ghana, when, the, muslims, cisse, dynasty, came, to, power, they, killed, bida, the, sacred, snake, and, protector, of, the, kingdom, a, seven, year, drought, ensued, destroying, the, kingdom, and, forcing, much, of, the, population, to, flee, in, search, of, more, hospitable, territory, according, to, much, later, traditions, from, the, late, nineteenth, and, twentieth, centuries, diara, kante, took, control, of, koumbi, saleh, and, established, the, diarisso, dynasty, his, son, soumaoro, kante, succeeded, him, and, forced, the, people, to, pay, him, tribute, the, sosso, also, managed, to, annex, the, neighboring, mandinka, state, of, kangaba, to, the, south, where, the, important, goldfields, of, bure, were, located, in, his, brief, overview, of, sudanese, history, ibn, khaldun, related, that, the, people, of, mali, outnumbered, the, peoples, of, the, sudan, in, their, neighborhood, and, dominated, the, whole, region, he, went, on, to, relate, that, they, vanquished, the, susu, and, acquired, all, their, possessions, both, their, ancient, kingdom, and, that, of, ghana, according, to, a, modern, tradition, this, resurgence, of, mali, was, led, by, sundiata, keita, the, founder, of, mali, and, ruler, of, its, core, area, of, kangaba, delafosse, assigned, an, arbitrary, but, widely, accepted, date, of, 1230, to, the, event, this, tradition, states, that, ghana, soumaba, cisse, at, the, time, a, vassal, of, the, sosso, rebelled, with, kangaba, and, became, part, of, a, loose, federation, of, mande, speaking, states, after, soumaoro, s, defeat, at, the, battle, of, kirina, in, 1235, a, date, again, assigned, arbitrarily, by, delafosse, the, new, rulers, of, koumbi, saleh, became, permanent, allies, of, the, mali, empire, as, mali, became, more, powerful, the, ghana, s, role, as, an, ally, declined, to, that, of, a, submissive, state, although, he, was, still, accorded, prestige, as, the, leader, of, an, ancient, and, storied, state, according, to, a, detailed, account, of, al, umari, written, around, 1340, but, based, on, testimony, given, to, him, by, the, truthful, and, trustworthy, shaykh, abu, uthman, sa, id, al, dukkali, ghana, still, retained, its, functions, as, a, sort, of, kingdom, within, the, empire, its, ruler, being, the, only, one, allowed, to, bear, the, title, malik, and, who, is, like, a, deputy, unto, him, koumbi, saleh, was, abandoned, sometime, in, the, 15th, century, most, of, the, information, about, the, economy, of, ghana, comes, from, al, bakri, he, noted, that, merchants, had, to, pay, a, tax, of, one, gold, dinar, on, imports, of, salt, and, two, on, exports, of, salt, other, products, had, fixed, dues, al, bakri, mentioned, both, copper, and, other, goods, imports, probably, included, products, such, as, textiles, ornaments, and, other, materials, many, of, the, hand, crafted, leather, goods, found, in, present, day, morocco, also, had, their, origins, in, the, empire, al, bakri, also, mentioned, that, muslims, played, a, central, role, in, commerce, and, held, court, appointments, ibn, hawqal, quotes, the, use, of, a, cheque, worth, 42, 000, dinars, the, main, centre, of, trade, was, koumbi, saleh, the, king, claimed, as, his, own, all, nuggets, of, gold, and, allowed, other, people, to, have, only, gold, dust, in, addition, to, the, influence, exerted, by, the, king, in, local, regions, tribute, was, received, from, various, tributary, states, and, chiefdoms, on, the, empire, s, periphery, the, introduction, of, the, camel, played, a, key, role, in, soninke, success, as, well, allowing, products, and, goods, to, be, transported, much, more, efficiently, across, the, sahara, these, contributing, factors, all, helped, the, empire, remain, powerful, for, some, time, providing, a, rich, and, stable, economy, based, on, trading, gold, iron, salt, and, slaves, in, its, last, centuries, ghana, increasingly, lost, control, of, the, gold, trade, to, the, mali, empire, and, relied, on, slave, raiding, and, trading, as, a, principal, economic, activity, testimony, about, ancient, ghana, depended, on, how, well, disposed, the, king, was, to, foreign, travelers, from, whom, the, majority, of, information, on, the, empire, comes, islamic, writers, often, commented, on, the, social, political, stability, of, the, empire, based, on, the, seemingly, just, actions, and, grandeur, of, the, king, al, bakri, a, moorish, nobleman, living, in, spain, questioned, merchants, who, visited, the, empire, in, the, 11th, century, and, wrote, of, the, king, he, sits, in, audience, or, to, hear, grievances, against, officials, in, a, domed, pavilion, around, which, stand, ten, horses, covered, with, gold, embroidered, materials, behind, the, king, stand, ten, pages, holding, shields, and, swords, decorated, with, gold, and, on, his, right, are, the, sons, of, the, kings, of, his, country, wearing, splendid, garments, and, their, hair, plaited, with, gold, the, governor, of, the, city, sits, on, the, ground, before, the, king, and, around, him, are, ministers, seated, likewise, at, the, door, of, the, pavilion, are, dogs, of, excellent, pedigree, that, hardly, ever, leave, the, place, where, the, king, is, guarding, him, around, their, necks, they, wear, collars, of, gold, and, silver, studded, with, a, number, of, balls, of, the, same, metals, ghana, appears, to, have, had, a, central, core, region, and, was, surrounded, by, vassal, states, including, the, baxaran, of, maghan, and, the, gbewaa, states, south, of, the, sahel, region, one, of, the, earliest, sources, to, describe, ghana, al, ya, qubi, writing, in, 889, 90, 276, ah, says, that, under, his, authority, are, a, number, of, kings, which, included, sama, and, am, and, so, extended, at, least, to, the, niger, river, valley, these, kings, were, presumably, the, rulers, of, the, territorial, units, often, called, kafu, in, mandinka, the, arabic, sources, are, vague, as, to, how, the, country, was, governed, al, bakri, far, and, away, the, most, detailed, one, mentions, that, the, king, had, officials, mazalim, who, surrounded, his, throne, when, he, gave, justice, and, these, included, the, sons, of, the, kings, of, his, country, which, we, must, assume, are, the, same, kings, that, al, ya, qubi, mentioned, in, his, account, of, nearly, 200, years, earlier, al, bakri, s, detailed, geography, of, the, region, shows, that, in, his, day, or, 1067, 1068, ghana, was, surrounded, by, independent, kingdoms, and, sila, one, of, them, located, on, the, senegal, river, was, almost, a, match, for, the, king, of, ghana, sama, is, the, only, such, entity, mentioned, as, a, province, as, it, was, in, al, ya, qubi, s, day, in, al, bakri, s, time, the, rulers, of, ghana, had, begun, to, incorporate, more, muslims, into, government, including, the, treasurer, his, interpreter, and, the, majority, of, his, officials, a, 17th, century, chronicle, written, in, timbuktu, the, tarikh, al, fattash, gave, the, name, of, the, empire, s, capital, as, koumbi, according, to, the, description, of, the, town, left, by, al, bakri, in, 1067, 1068, the, capital, actually, consisted, of, two, cities, 10, kilometres, 6, mi, apart, but, between, these, two, towns, are, continuous, habitations, so, that, they, might, be, said, to, have, merged, into, one, the, most, common, identification, for, this, capital, is, the, site, of, koumbi, saleh, on, the, rim, of, the, sahara, desert, according, to, al, bakri, the, major, part, of, the, city, was, called, el, ghaba, and, was, the, residence, of, the, king, it, was, protected, by, a, stone, wall, and, functioned, as, the, royal, and, spiritual, capital, of, the, empire, it, contained, a, sacred, grove, of, trees, in, which, priests, lived, it, also, contained, the, king, s, palace, the, grandest, structure, in, the, city, surrounded, by, other, domed, buildings, there, was, also, one, mosque, for, visiting, muslim, officials, el, ghaba, coincidentally, or, not, means, the, forest, in, arabic, the, name, of, the, other, section, of, the, city, is, not, recorded, in, the, vicinity, were, wells, with, fresh, water, used, to, grow, vegetables, it, was, inhabited, almost, entirely, by, muslims, who, had, with, twelve, mosques, one, of, which, was, designated, for, friday, prayers, and, had, a, full, group, of, scholars, scribes, and, islamic, jurists, because, the, majority, of, these, muslims, were, merchants, this, part, of, the, city, was, probably, its, primary, business, district, it, is, likely, that, these, inhabitants, were, largely, black, muslims, known, as, the, wangara, and, are, today, known, as, jakhanke, or, mandinka, the, separate, and, autonomous, towns, outside, of, the, main, governmental, center, is, a, well, known, practice, used, by, the, jakhanke, tribe, of, the, mandinka, people, throughout, history, beginning, in, the, 1920s, french, archaeologists, excavated, the, site, of, koumbi, saleh, although, there, have, always, been, controversies, about, the, location, of, ghana, s, capital, and, whether, koumbi, saleh, is, the, same, town, as, the, one, described, by, al, bakri, the, site, was, excavated, in, 1949, 50, by, paul, thomassey, and, raymond, mauny, and, by, another, french, team, in, 1975, 81, the, remains, of, koumbi, saleh, are, impressive, even, if, the, remains, of, the, royal, town, with, its, large, palace, and, burial, mounds, have, not, been, located, in, recent, years, the, identification, of, koumbi, saleh, with, the,
