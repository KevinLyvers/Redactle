present, day, northeast, germany, it, refers, not, to, a, homogeneous, people, but, to, various, people, tribes, or, groups, depending, on, where, and, when, it, was, used, in, the, modern, day, communities, identifying, as, wendish, exist, in, slovenia, austria, lusatia, the, united, states, such, as, the, texas, wends, and, australia, in, german, speaking, europe, during, the, middle, ages, the, term, wends, was, interpreted, as, synonymous, with, slavs, and, sporadically, used, in, literature, to, refer, to, west, slavs, and, south, slavs, living, within, the, holy, roman, empire, the, name, has, possibly, survived, in, finnic, languages, finnish, ven, j, estonian, vene, karelian, vene, denoting, modern, russia, according, to, one, theory, germanic, peoples, first, applied, this, name, to, the, ancient, veneti, for, the, medieval, scandinavians, the, term, wends, vender, meant, slavs, living, near, the, southern, shore, of, the, baltic, sea, vendland, and, the, term, was, therefore, used, to, refer, to, polabian, slavs, like, the, obotrites, rugian, slavs, veleti, lutici, and, pomeranian, tribes, for, people, living, in, the, medieval, northern, holy, roman, empire, and, its, precursors, especially, for, the, saxons, a, wend, wende, was, a, slav, living, in, the, area, west, of, the, river, oder, an, area, later, entitled, germania, slavica, settled, by, the, polabian, slav, tribes, mentioned, above, in, the, north, and, by, others, such, as, the, sorbs, and, the, milceni, further, south, see, sorbian, march, the, germans, in, the, south, used, the, term, winde, instead, of, wende, and, applied, it, just, as, the, germans, in, the, north, to, slavs, they, had, contact, with, e, g, the, polabians, from, bavaria, slavica, or, the, slovenes, the, names, windic, march, windisch, feistritz, windischgraz, or, windisch, bleiberg, near, ferlach, still, bear, testimony, to, this, historical, denomination, the, same, term, was, sometimes, applied, to, the, neighboring, region, of, slavonia, which, appears, as, windischland, in, some, documents, prior, to, the, 18th, century, following, the, 8th, century, the, frankish, kings, and, their, successors, organised, nearly, all, wendish, land, into, marches, this, process, later, turned, into, the, series, of, crusades, by, the, 12th, century, all, wendish, lands, had, become, part, of, the, holy, roman, empire, in, the, course, of, the, ostsiedlung, which, reached, its, peak, in, the, 12th, to, 14th, centuries, this, land, was, settled, by, germans, and, reorganised, due, to, the, process, of, assimilation, following, german, settlement, many, slavs, west, of, the, oder, adopted, the, german, culture, and, language, only, some, rural, communities, which, did, not, have, a, strong, admixture, with, germans, and, continued, to, use, west, slavic, languages, were, still, termed, wends, with, the, gradual, decline, of, the, use, of, these, local, slavic, tongues, the, term, wends, slowly, disappeared, too, some, sources, claim, that, in, the, 13th, century, there, were, actual, historic, people, called, wends, or, vends, living, as, far, as, northern, latvia, east, of, the, baltic, sea, around, the, city, of, wenden, henry, of, livonia, henricus, de, lettis, in, his, 13th, century, latin, chronicle, described, a, tribe, called, the, vindi, today, only, one, group, of, wends, still, exists, the, lusatian, sorbs, in, present, day, eastern, germany, with, international, diaspora, the, term, wends, derived, from, the, roman, era, people, called, in, latin, venet, veneth, or, vened, in, greek, translit, ouen, dai, this, people, is, mentioned, by, pliny, the, elder, and, ptolemy, as, inhabiting, the, baltic, coast, in, the, 1st, millennium, ad, during, the, slavic, migrations, which, split, the, slavs, into, southern, eastern, and, western, groups, some, west, slavs, moved, into, the, areas, between, the, rivers, elbe, and, oder, moving, from, east, to, west, and, from, south, to, north, there, they, assimilated, the, remaining, germanic, population, that, had, not, left, the, area, in, the, migration, period, their, german, neighbours, adapted, the, term, they, had, been, using, for, peoples, east, of, the, river, elbe, before, to, the, slavs, calling, them, wends, as, they, called, the, venedi, before, and, probably, the, vandals, as, well, in, his, late, sixth, century, work, history, of, armenia, movses, khorenatsi, mentions, their, raids, into, the, lands, named, vanand, after, them, the, wends, are, mentioned, in, fredegar, iv, 74, 75, the, lived, east, of, the, river, elbe, and, were, neighbours, of, the, saxons, the, saxons, paid, tribute, to, the, merovingian, kingdom, since, chlothar, i, 511, 561, they, had, to, pay, 500, cows, yearly, and, had, the, obligation, to, guard, the, sector, of, the, frankish, border, against, the, wends, however, the, saxons, broke, their, oath, under, dagobert, i, which, resulted, in, frequent, raids, of, wends, into, frankish, territory, and, spreading, out, over, thuringia, and, other, territory, the, saxon, duplicity, is, one, of, the, reasons, for, future, military, campaigns, against, them, by, the, carolingians, especially, charles, martel, and, charlemagne, while, the, wends, were, arriving, in, so, called, germania, slavica, as, large, homogeneous, groups, they, soon, divided, into, a, variety, of, small, tribes, with, large, strips, of, woodland, separating, one, tribal, settlement, area, from, another, their, tribal, names, were, derived, from, local, place, names,

could, retreat, in, case, of, a, raid, from, the, neighbouring, tribe, or, used, as, military, strongholds, or, outposts, some, tribes, unified, into, larger, duchy, like, units, for, example, the, obotrites, evolved, from, the, unification, of, the, holstein, and, western, mecklenburg, tribes, led, by, mighty, dukes, known, for, their, raids, into, german, saxony, the, lutici, were, an,
