because, of, the, non, exhaustive, time, frame, and, restricted, location, that, the, mummies, represent, their, study, nevertheless, showed, that, these, ancient, egyptians, closely, resembled, ancient, and, modern, near, eastern, populations, especially, those, in, the, levant, and, had, almost, no, dna, from, sub, saharan, africa, what, s, more, the, genetics, of, the, mummies, remained,

recognition, by, the, native, egyptian, populace, they, named, themselves, as, the, successors, to, the, pharaohs, the, later, ptolemies, took, on, egyptian, traditions, had, themselves, portrayed, on, public, monuments, in, egyptian, style, and, dress, and, participated, in, egyptian, religious, life, the, last, ruler, from, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, was, cleopatra, who, committed, suicide, following, the, burial, of, her, lover, mark, antony, who, had, died, in, her, arms, from, a, self, inflicted, stab, wound, after, augustus, had, captured, alexandria, and, her, mercenary, forces, had, fled, the, ptolemies, faced, rebellions, of, native, egyptians, often, caused, by, an, unwanted, regime, and, were, involved, in, foreign, and, civil, wars, that, led, to, the, decline, of, the, kingdom, and, its, annexation, by, rome, nevertheless, hellenistic, culture, continued, to, thrive, in, egypt, well, after, the, muslim, conquest, the, native, egyptian, coptic, culture, continued, to, exist, as, well, the, coptic, language, itself, was, egypt, s, most, widely, spoken, language, until, at, least, the, 10th, century, egypt, quickly, became, the, empire, s, breadbasket, supplying, the, greater, portion, of, the, empire, s, grain, in, addition, to, flax, papyrus, glass, and, many, other, finished, goods, the, city, of, alexandria, became, a, key, trading, outpost, for, the, roman, empire, by, some, accounts, the, most, important, for, a, time, shipping, from, egypt, regularly, reached, india, and, ethiopia, among, other, international, destinations, it, was, also, a,

sources, as, agiptus, refers, to, the, brief, rule, of, egypt, and, parts, of, libya, by, the, sasanian, empire, which, lasted, from, 619, to, 629, until, the, sasanian, rebel, shahrbaraz, made, an, alliance, with, the, byzantine, emperor, heraclius, and, had, control, over, egypt, returned, to, him, the, byzantines, were, able, to, regain, control, of, the, country, after, a, brief, persian, invasion, early, in, the, 7th, century, until, 639, 642, when, egypt, was, invaded, and, conquered, by, the, arab, islamic, empire, the, final, loss, of, egypt, was, of, incalculable, significance, to, the, byzantine, empire, which, had, relied, on, egypt, for, many, agricultural, and, manufactured, goods, when, they, defeated, the, byzantine, armies, in, egypt, the, arabs, brought, sunni, islam, to, the, country, early, in, this, period, egyptians, began, to, blend, their, new, faith, with, their, christian, traditions, as, well, as, other, indigenous, beliefs, and, practices, leading,

its, population, the, brief, french, invasion, of, egypt, led, by, napoleon, bonaparte, began, in, 1798, the, campaign, eventually, led, to, the, discovery, of, the, rosetta, stone, creating, the, field, of, egyptology, despite, early, victories, and, an, initially, successful, expedition, into, syria, napoleon, and, his, arm, e, d, orient, were, eventually, defeated, and, forced, to, withdraw, especially, after, suffering, the, defeat, of, the, supporting, french, fleet, at, the, battle, of, the, nile, the, expulsion, of, the, french, in, 1801, by, ottoman, mamluk, and, british, forces, was, followed, by, four, years, of, anarchy, in, which, ottomans, mamluks, and, albanians, who, were, nominally, in, the, service, of, the, ottomans, wrestled, for, power, out, of, this, chaos, the, commander, of, the, albanian, regiment, muhammad, ali, kavalali, mehmed, ali, pasha, emerged, as, a, dominant, figure, and, in, 1805, was, acknowledged, by, the, sultan, in, istanbul, as, his, viceroy, in, egypt, the, title, implied, subordination, to, the, sultan, but, this, was, in, fact, a, polite, fiction, ottoman, power, in, egypt, was, finished, and, muhammad, ali, an, ambitious, and, able, leader, established, a, dynasty, that, was, to, rule, egypt, until, the, revolution, of, 1952, after, 1882, the, dynasty, became, a, british, puppet, muhammad, ali, s, primary, focus, was, military, he, annexed, northern, sudan, 1820, 1824, syria, 1833, and, parts, of, arabia, and, anatolia, but, in, 1841, the, european, powers, fearful, lest, he, topple, the, ottoman, empire, itself, forced, him, to, return, most, of, his, conquests, to, the, ottomans, he, kept, the, sudan, and, his, title, to, egypt, was, made, hereditary, a, more, lasting, result, of, his, military, ambition, is, that, it, required, him, to, modernize, the, country, eager, to, adopt, the, military, and, therefore, industrial, techniques, of, the, great, powers, he, sent, students, to, the, west, and, invited, training, missions, to, egypt, he, built, industries, a, system, of, canals, for, irrigation, and, transport, and, reformed, the, civil, service, the, introduction, in, 1820, of, long, staple, cotton, the, egyptian, variety, of, which, became, notable, transformed, its, agriculture, into, a, cash, crop, monoculture, before, the, end, of, the, century, the, social, effects, of, this, were, enormous, land, ownership, became, concentrated, and, many, foreigners, arrived, shifting, production, towards, international, markets, british, indirect, rule, lasted, from, 1882, when, the, british, succeeded, in, defeating, the, egyptian, army, at, tel, el, kebir, in, september, and, took, control, of, the, country, to, the, 1952, egyptian, revolution, which, made, egypt, a, republic, and, when, british, advisers, were, expelled, muhammad, ali, was, succeeded, briefly, by, his, son, ibrahim, in, september, 1848, then, by, a, grandson, abbas, i, in, november, 1848, then, by, said,

french, was, completed, in, 1869, the, cost, of, this, and, other, projects, had, two, effects, it, led, to, enormous, debt, to, european, banks, and, caused, popular, discontent, because, of, the, onerous, taxation, it, required, in, 1875, ismail, sold, egypt, s, 44, share, in, the, canal, to, the, british, government, ismail, also, tried, to, conquer, the, ethiopian, empire, and, was, defeated, twice, at, gundet, in, 1875, and, again, at, the, battle, of, gura, in, 1876, within, three, years, this, led, to, the, imposition, of, british, and, french, controllers, who, sat, in, the, egyptian, cabinet, and, with, the, financial, power, of, the, bondholders, behind, them, were, the, real, power, in, the, government, local, dissatisfaction, with, ismail, and, with, european,
