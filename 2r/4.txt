or, social, activities, they, have, been, metaphorically, defined, as, the, secretions, of, an, organism, and, are, distinguished, from, documents, that, have, been, consciously, written, or, created, to, communicate, a, particular, message, to, posterity, in, general, archives, consist, of, records, that, have, been, selected, for, permanent, or, long, term, preservation, on, the, grounds, of, their, enduring, cultural, historical, or, evidentiary, value, archival, records, are, normally, unpublished, and, almost, always, unique, unlike, books, or, magazines, of, which, many, identical, copies, may, exist, this, means, that, archives, are, quite, distinct, from, libraries, with, regard, to, their, functions, and, organization, although, archival, collections, can, often, be, found, within, library, buildings, a, person, who, works, in, archives, is, called, an, archivist, the, study, and, practice, of, organizing, preserving, and, providing, access, to, information, and,

century, and, the, word, archivist, in, the, mid, 18th, century, although, in, these, periods, both, terms, were, usually, used, only, in, reference, to, foreign, institutions, and, personnel, not,

records, or, diaries, created, or, collected, by, the, individual, regardless, of, medium, or, format, the, archives, of, an, organization, such, as, a, corporation, or, government, tend, to, contain, other, types, of, records, such, as, administrative, files, business, records, memos, official, correspondence, and, meeting, minutes, some, archives, are, made, up, of, a, compilation, of, both, types, of, collections, an, example, of, this, type, of, combined, compilation, is, the, transgender, archives, at, the, university, of, victoria, which, contain, a, multitude, of, collections, of, donations, from, both, individuals, and, organizations, from, all, over, the, world, many, of, these, donations, have, yet, to, be, cataloged, but, are, currently, in, the, process, of, being, digitally, preserved, and, made, available, to, the, public, online, the, arctic, world, archive, is, a, commercially, run, facility, for, data, preservation, located, in, the, svalbard, archipelago, norway, that, contains, data, of, historical, and, cultural, interest, from, several, countries, as, well, as, all, of, american, multinational, company, github, s, open, source, code, the, data, is, kept, on, reels, of, specially, developed, film, in, a, steel, vault, buried, deep, beneath, the, permafrost, with, the, data, storage, medium, expected, to, last, for, 500, to, 1000, years, the, international, council, on, archives, ica, has, developed, a, number, of, standards, on, archival, description, including, the, general, international, standard, archival, description, isad, g, isad, g, is, meant, to, be, used, in, conjunction, with, national, standards, or, as, a, basis, for, nations, to, build, their, own, standards, in, the, united, states, isad, g, is, implemented, through, describing, archives, a, content, standard, popularly, known, as, dacs, in, canada, isad, g, is, implemented, through, the, council, of, archives, as, the, rules, for, archival, description, also, known, as, rad, iso, is, currently, working, on, standards, the, cultural, property, stored, in, archives, is, threatened, by, natural, disasters, wars, or, other, emergencies, in, many, countries, international, partners, for, archives, are, unesco, and, blue, shield, international, in, accordance, with, the, hague, convention, for, the, protection, of, cultural, property, from, 1954, and, its, 2nd, protocol, from, 1999, from, a, national, and, international, perspective, there, are, many, collaborations, between, archives, and, local, blue, shield, organizations, to, ensure, the, sustainable, existence, of, cultural, property, storage, facilities, in, addition, to, working, with, united, nations, peacekeeping, in, the, event, of, war, the, protection, of, the, archives, requires, the, creation, of, no, strike, lists, the, linking, of, civil, and, military, structures, and, the, training, of, local, personnel, archives, that, primarily, contain, physical, artifacts, and, printed, documents, are, increasingly, shifting, to, digitizing, items, that, did, not, originate, digitally, which, are, then, usually, stored, away, this, allows, for, greater, accessibility, when, using, search, tools, and, databases, as, well, as, an, increase, in, the, availability, of, digitized, materials, from, outside, the, physical, parameters, of, an, archive, but, there, may, be, an, element, of, loss, or, disconnect, when, there, are, gaps, in, what, items, are, made, available, digitally, both, physical, and, digital, archives, also, generally, have, specific, limitations, regarding, the, types, of, content, that, are, deemed, able, to, be, preserved, categorized, and, archived, conventional, institutionalized, archive, spaces, have, a, tendency, to, prioritize, tangible, items, over, ephemeral, experiences, actions, effects, and, even, bodies, this, type, of, potentially, biased, prioritization, may, be, seen, as, a, form, of, privileging, particular, types, of, knowledge, or, interpreting, certain, experiences, as, more, valid, than, others, limiting, the, content, available, to, archive, users, leading, to, barriers, in, accessing, information, and, potentially, alienating, under, represented, and, or, marginalized, populations, and, their, epistemologies, and, ontologies, as, omnia, el, shakry, shows, dealing, with, destruction, is, a, challenge, central, to, decolonial, historiography, when, faced, with, a, lack, of, archival, documents, historians, resort, to, different, sources, and, methods, for, example, due, to, the, lack, of, a, palestinian, state, archive, many, historians, of, nakba, had, to, rely, on, sources, in, the, israeli, state, s, archives, as, a, result, of, this, perceived, under, representation, some, activists, are, making, efforts, to, decolonize, contemporary, archival, institutions, that, may, employ, hegemonic, and, white, supremacist, practices, by, implementing, subversive, alternatives, such, as, anarchiving, or, counter, archiving, with, the, intention, of, making, intersectional, accessibility, a, priority, for, those, who, cannot, or, do, not, want, to, access, contemporary, archival, institutions, an, example, of, this, is, morgan, m, page, s, description, of, disseminating, transgender, history, directly, to, trans, people, through, various, social, media, and, networking, platforms, like, tumblr, twitter, and, instagram, as, well, as, via, podcast, while, the, majority, of, archived, materials, are, typically, well, conserved, within, their, collections, anarchiving, s, attention, to, ephemerality, also, brings, to, light, the, inherent, impermanence, and, gradual, change, of, physical, objects, over, time, as, a, result, of, being, handled, the, concept, of, counter, archiving, brings, into, question, what, tends, to, be, considered, archivable, and, what, is, therefore, selected, to, be, preserved, within, conventional, contemporary, archives, with, the, options, available, through, counter, archiving, there, is, the, potential, to, challenge, traditional, conceptions, of, history, as, they, are, perceived, within, contemporary, archives, which, creates, space, for, narratives, that, are, often, not, present, in, many, archival, materials, the, unconventional, nature, of, counter, archiving, practices, makes, room, for, the, maintenance, of, ephemeral, qualities, contained, within, certain, historically, significant, experiences, performances, and, personally, or, culturally, relevant, stories, that, do, not, typically, have, a, space, in, conventional, archives, the, practices, of, anarchiving, and, counter, archiving, are, both, rooted, in, social, justice, work
