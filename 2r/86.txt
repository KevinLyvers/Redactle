the, silk, road, was, a, network, of, eurasian, trade, routes, active, from, the, second, century, bce, until, the, mid, 15th, century, spanning, over, 6, 400, km, 4, 000, mi, it, played, a, central, role, in, facilitating, economic, cultural, political, and, religious, interactions, between, the, eastern, and, western, worlds, the, name, silk, road, was, first, coined, in, the, late, 19th, century, but, some, 20th, and, 21st, century, historians, instead, prefer, the, term, silk, routes, on, the, grounds, that, it, more, accurately, describes, the, intricate, web, of, land, and, sea, routes, connecting, central, east, south, southeast, and, west, asia, as, well, as, east, africa, and, southern, europe, the, silk, road, derives, its, name, from, the, highly, lucrative, trade, of, silk, textiles, that, were, primarily, produced, in, china, the, network, began, with, the, expansion, of, the, han, dynasty, 202, bce, 220, ce, into, central, asia, around, 114, bce, through, the, missions, and, explorations, of, the, chinese, imperial, envoy, zhang, qian, which, brought, the, region, under, unified, control, the, chinese, took, great, interest, in, the, security, of, their, trade, products, and, extended, the, great, wall, of, china, to, ensure, the, protection, of, the, trade, route, by, the, first, century, ce, chinese, silk, was, widely, sought, after, in, rome, egypt, and, greece, other, lucrative, commodities, from, the, east, included, tea, dyes, perfumes, and, porcelain, among, western, exports, were, horses, camels, honey, wine, and, gold, aside, from, generating, substantial, wealth, for, emerging, mercantile, classes, the, proliferation, of, goods, such, as, paper, and, gunpowder, greatly, affected, the, trajectory, of, political, history, in, several, theatres, in, eurasia, and, beyond, the, silk, road, was, utilized, over, a, period, that, saw, immense, political, variation, across, the, continent, exemplified, by, major, events, such, as, the, black, death, and, the, mongol, conquests, the, network, was, highly, decentralized, and, security, was, sparse, travelers, faced, constant, threats, of, banditry, and, nomadic, raiders, and, long, expanses, of, inhospitable, terrain, few, individuals, traveled, the, entire, length, of, the, silk, road, instead, relying, on, a, succession, of, middlemen, based, at, various, stopping, points, along, the, way, in, addition, to, goods, the, network, facilitated, an, unprecedented, exchange, of, religious, especially, buddhist, philosophical, and, scientific, thought, much, of, which, was, syncretised, by, societies, along, the, way, likewise, a, wide, variety, of, people, used, the, routes, diseases, such, as, plague, also, spread, along, the, silk, road, possibly, contributing, to, the, black, death, from, 1453, onwards, the, ottoman, empire, began, competing, with, other, gunpowder, empires, for, greater, control, over, the, overland, routes, which, prompted, european, polities, to, seek, alternatives, while, themselves, gaining, leverage, over, their, trade, partners, this, marked, the, beginning, of, the, age, of, discovery, european, colonialism, and, the, further, intensification, of, globalization, in, the, 21st, century, the, name, new, silk, road, is, used, to, describe, several, large, infrastructure, projects, along, many, of, the, historic, trade, routes, among, the, best, known, include, the, eurasian, land, bridge, and, the, chinese, belt, and, road, initiative, bri, in, june, 2014, unesco, designated, the, chang, an, tianshan, corridor, of, the, silk, road, as, a, world, heritage, site, while, the, indian, portion, remains, on, the, tentative, site, list, the, silk, road, derives, its, name, from, the, lucrative, trade, in, silk, first, developed, in, china, and, a, major, reason, for, the, connection, of, trade, routes, into, an, extensive, transcontinental, network, it, derives, from, the, german, term, seidenstra, e, literally, silk, road, and, was, first, popularized, in, 1877, by, ferdinand, von, richthofen, who, made, seven, expeditions, to, china, from, 1868, to, 1872, however, the, term, itself, had, been, in, use, in, decades, prior, to, that, the, alternative, translation, silk, route, is, also, used, occasionally, although, the, term, was, coined, in, the, 19th, century, it, did, not, gain, widespread, acceptance, in, academia, or, popularity, among, the, public, until, the, 20th, century, the, first, book, entitled, the, silk, road, was, by, swedish, geographer, sven, hedin, in, 1938, the, use, of, the, term, silk, road, is, not, without, its, detractors, for, instance, warwick, ball, contends, that, the, maritime, spice, trade, with, india, and, arabia, was, far, more, consequential, for, the, economy, of, the, roman, empire, than, the, silk, trade, with, china, which, at, sea, was, conducted, mostly, through, india, and, on, land, was, handled, by, numerous, intermediaries, such, as, the, sogdians, going, as, far, as, to, call, the, whole, thing, a, myth, of, modern, academia, ball, argues, that, there, was, no, coherent, overland, trade, system, and, no, free, movement, of, goods, from, east, asia, to, the, west, until, the, period, of, the, mongol, empire, he, notes, that, traditional, authors, discussing, east, west, trade, such, as, marco, polo, and, edward, gibbon, never, labelled, any, route, a, silk, one, in, particular, william, dalrymple, concurs, and, refers, to, the, india, rome, route, as, the, golden, road, the, southern, stretches, of, the, silk, road, from, khotan, xinjiang, to, eastern, china, were, first, used, for, jade, and, not, silk, as, long, as, 5000, bce, and, are, still, in, use, for, this, purpose, the, term, jade, road, would, have, been, more, appropriate, than, silk, road, had, it, not, been, for, the, far, larger, and, geographically, wider, nature, of, the, silk, trade, the, term, is, in, current, use, in, china, the, silk, road, consisted, of, several, routes, as, it, extended, westwards, from, the, ancient, commercial, centres, of, china, the, overland, intercontinental, silk, road, divided, into, northern, and, southern, routes, bypassing, the, taklamakan, desert, and, lop, nur, merchants, along, these, routes, were, involved, in, relay, trade, in, which, goods, changed, hands, many, times, before, reaching, their, final, destinations, the, northern, route, started, at, chang, an, now, called, xi, an, an, ancient, capital, of, china, that, was, moved, further, east, during, the, later, han, to, luoyang, the, route, was, defined, around, the, 1st, century, bce, when, han, wudi, put, an, end, to, harassment, by, nomadic, tribes, the, northern, route, travelled, northwest, through, the, chinese, province, of, gansu, from, shaanxi, province, and, split, into, three, further, routes, two, of, them, following, the, mountain, ranges, to, the, north, and, south, of, the, taklamakan, desert, to, rejoin, at, kashgar, and, the, other, going, north, of, the, tian, shan, mountains, through, turpan, talgar, and, almaty, in, what, is, now, southeast, kazakhstan, the, routes, split, again, west, of, kashgar, with, a, southern, branch, heading, down, the, alai, valley, towards, termez, in, modern, uzbekistan, and, balkh, afghanistan, while, the, other, travelled, through, kokand, in, the, fergana, valley, in, present, day, eastern, uzbekistan, and, then, west, across, the, karakum, desert, both, routes, joined, the, main, southern, route, before, reaching, ancient, merv, turkmenistan, another, branch, of, the, northern, route, turned, northwest, past, the, aral, sea, and, north, of, the, caspian, sea, then, and, on, to, the, black, sea, a, route, for, caravans, the, northern, silk, road, brought, to, china, many, goods, such, as, dates, saffron, powder, and, pistachio, nuts, from, persia, frankincense, aloes, and, myrrh, from, somalia, sandalwood, from, india, glass, bottles, from, egypt, and, other, expensive, and, desirable, goods, from, other, parts, of, the, world, in, exchange, the, caravans, sent, back, bolts, of, silk, brocade, lacquer, ware, and, porcelain, the, southern, route, or, karakoram, route, was, mainly, a, single, route, from, china, through, the, karakoram, mountains, where, it, persists, in, modern, times, as, the, karakoram, highway, a, paved, road, that, connects, pakistan, and, china, it, then, set, off, westwards, but, with, southward, spurs, so, travelers, could, complete, the, journey, by, sea, from, various, points, crossing, the, high, mountains, it, passed, through, northern, pakistan, over, the, hindu, kush, mountains, and, into, afghanistan, rejoining, the, northern, route, near, merv, turkmenistan, from, merv, it, followed, a, nearly, straight, line, west, through, mountainous, northern, iran, mesopotamia, and, the, northern, tip, of, the, syrian, desert, to, the, levant, where, mediterranean, trading, ships, plied, regular, routes, to, italy, while, land, routes, went, either, north, through, anatolia, or, south, to, north, africa, another, branch, road, travelled, from, herat, through, susa, to, charax, spasinu, at, the, head, of, the, persian, gulf, and, across, to, petra, and, on, to, alexandria, and, other, eastern, mediterranean, ports, from, where, ships, carried, the, cargoes, to, rome, the, southwestern, route, is, believed, to, be, the, ganges, brahmaputra, delta, which, has, been, the, subject, of, international, interest, for, over, two, millennia, strabo, the, 1st, century, roman, writer, mentions, the, deltaic, lands, regarding, merchants, who, now, sail, from, egypt, as, far, as, the, ganges, they, are, only, private, citizens, his, comments, are, interesting, as, roman, beads, and, other, materials, are, being, found, at, wari, bateshwar, ruins, the, ancient, city, with, roots, from, much, earlier, before, the, bronze, age, presently, being, slowly, excavated, beside, the, old, brahmaputra, in, bangladesh, ptolemy, s, map, of, the, ganges, delta, a, remarkably, accurate, effort, showed, that, his, informants, knew, all, about, the, course, of, the, brahmaputra, river, crossing, through, the, himalayas, then, bending, westward, to, its, source, in, tibet, it, is, doubtless, that, this, delta, was, a, major, international, trading, center, almost, certainly, from, much, earlier, than, the, common, era, gemstones, and, other, merchandise, from, thailand, and, java, were, traded, in, the, delta, and, through, it, chinese, archaeological, writer, bin, yang, and, some, earlier, writers, and, archaeologists, such, as, janice, stargardt, strongly, suggest, this, route, of, international, trade, as, sichuan, yunnan, burma, bangladesh, route, according, to, bin, yang, especially, from, the, 12th, century, the, route, was, used, to, ship, bullion, from, yunnan, gold, and, silver, are, among, the, minerals, in, which, yunnan, is, rich, through, northern, burma, into, modern, bangladesh, making, use, of, the, ancient, route, known, as, the, ledo, route, the, emerging, evidence, of, the, ancient, cities, of, bangladesh, in, particular, wari, bateshwar, ruins, mahasthangarh, bhitagarh, bikrampur, egarasindhur, and, sonargaon, are, believed, to, be, the, international, trade, centers, in, this, route, the, maritime, silk, road, or, maritime, silk, route, is, the, maritime, section, of, the, historic, silk, road, that, connected, southeast, asia, east, asia, the, indian, subcontinent, the, arabian, peninsula, eastern, africa, and, europe, it, began, by, the, 2nd, century, bce, and, flourished, until, the, 15th, century, ce, the, maritime, silk, road, was, primarily, established, and, operated, by, austronesian, sailors, in, southeast, asia, who, sailed, large, long, distance, ocean, going, sewn, plank, and, lashed, lug, trade, ships, 11, the, route, was, also, utilized, by, the, dhows, of, the, persian, and, arab, traders, in, the, arabian, sea, and, beyond, 13, and, the, tamil, merchants, in, south, asia, 13, china, also, started, building, their, own, trade, ships, chu, n, and, followed, the, routes, in, the, later, period, from, the, 10th, to, the, 15th, centuries, ce, the, network, followed, the, footsteps, of, older, austronesian, jade, maritime, networks, in, southeast, asia, as, well, as, the, maritime, spice, networks, between, southeast, asia, and, south, asia, and, the, west, asian, maritime, networks, in, the, arabian, sea, and, beyond, coinciding, with, these, ancient, maritime, trade, roads, by, the, current, era, austronesian, thalassocracies, controlled, the, flow, of, trade, in, the, eastern, regions, of, the, maritime, silk, road, especially, the, polities, around, the, straits, of, malacca, and, bangka, the, malay, peninsula, and, the, mekong, delta, through, which, passed, the, main, routes, of, the, austronesian, trade, ships, to, giao, ch, in, the, tonkin, gulf, and, guangzhou, southern, china, the, endpoints, later, also, including, quanzhou, by, the, 10th, century, ce, secondary, routes, also, passed, through, the, coastlines, of, the, gulf, of, thailand, as, well, as, through, the, java, sea, celebes, sea, banda, sea, and, the, sulu, sea, reconnecting, with, the, main, route, through, the, northern, philippines, and, taiwan, the, secondary, routes, also, continue, onward, to, the, east, china, sea, and, the, yellow, sea, for, a, limited, extent, the, main, route, of, the, western, regions, of, the, maritime, silk, road, directly, crosses, the, indian, ocean, from, the, northern, tip, of, sumatra, or, through, the, sunda, strait, to, sri, lanka, southern, india, and, bangladesh, and, the, maldives, it, branches, from, here, into, routes, through, the, arabian, sea, entering, the, gulf, of, oman, into, the, persian, gulf, and, the, gulf, of, aden, into, the, red, sea, secondary, routes, also, pass, through, the, coastlines, of, the, bay, of, bengal, the, arabian, sea, and, southwards, along, the, coast, of, east, africa, to, zanzibar, the, comoros, madagascar, and, the, seychelles, the, term, maritime, silk, road, is, a, modern, name, acquired, from, its, similarity, to, the, overland, silk, road, like, the, overland, routes, the, ancient, maritime, routes, through, southeast, asia, and, the, indian, ocean, had, no, particular, name, for, the, majority, of, its, very, long, history, despite, the, modern, name, the, maritime, silk, road, involved, exchanges, in, a, wide, variety, of, goods, over, a, very, wide, region, not, just, silk, or, asian, exports, it, differed, significantly, in, several, aspects, from, the, overland, silk, road, and, thus, should, not, be, viewed, as, a, mere, extension, of, it, traders, traveling, through, the, maritime, silk, road, could, span, the, entire, distance, of, the, maritime, routes, instead, of, through, regional, relays, as, with, the, overland, route, ships, could, carry, far, larger, amounts, of, goods, creating, greater, economic, impact, with, each, exchange, goods, carried, by, the, ships, also, differed, from, goods, carried, by, caravans, traders, on, the, maritime, route, faced, different, perils, like, weather, and, piracy, but, they, were, not, affected, by, political, instability, and, could, simply, avoid, areas, in, conflict, central, eurasia, has, been, known, from, ancient, times, for, its, horse, riding, and, horse, breeding, communities, and, the, overland, steppe, route, across, the, northern, steppes, of, central, eurasia, was, in, use, long, before, that, of, the, silk, road, archeological, sites, such, as, the, berel, burial, ground, in, kazakhstan, confirmed, that, the, nomadic, arimaspians, were, not, only, breeding, horses, for, trade, but, also, produced, great, craftsmen, able, to, propagate, exquisite, art, pieces, along, the, silk, road, from, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, nephrite, jade, was, being, traded, from, mines, in, the, region, of, yarkand, and, khotan, to, china, significantly, these, mines, were, not, very, far, from, the, lapis, lazuli, and, spinel, balas, ruby, mines, in, badakhshan, and, although, separated, by, the, formidable, pamir, mountains, routes, across, them, were, apparently, in, use, from, very, early, times, genetic, study, of, the, tarim, mummies, found, in, the, tarim, basin, in, the, area, of, loulan, located, along, the, silk, road, 200, kilometres, 124, miles, east, of, yingpan, dating, to, as, early, as, 1600, bce, suggest, very, ancient, contacts, between, east, and, west, these, mummified, remains, may, have, been, of, people, who, spoke, indo, european, languages, which, remained, in, use, in, the, tarim, basin, in, the, modern, day, xinjiang, region, until, replaced, by, turkic, influences, from, the, xiongnu, culture, to, the, north, and, by, chinese, influences, from, the, eastern, han, dynasty, who, spoke, a, sino, tibetan, language, some, remnants, of, what, was, probably, chinese, silk, dating, from, 1070, bce, have, been, found, in, ancient, egypt, the, great, oasis, cities, of, central, asia, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, effective, functioning, of, the, silk, road, trade, the, originating, source, seems, sufficiently, reliable, but, silk, degrades, very, rapidly, so, it, cannot, be, verified, whether, it, was, cultivated, silk, which, almost, certainly, came, from, china, or, a, type, of, wild, silk, which, might, have, come, from, the, mediterranean, or, middle, east, following, contacts, between, metropolitan, china, and, nomadic, western, border, territories, in, the, 8th, century, bce, gold, was, introduced, from, central, asia, and, chinese, jade, carvers, began, to, make, imitation, designs, of, the, steppes, adopting, the, scythian, style, animal, art, of, the, steppes, depictions, of, animals, locked, in, combat, this, style, is, particularly, reflected, in, the, rectangular, belt, plaques, made, of, gold, and, bronze, with, other, versions, in, jade, and, steatite, an, elite, burial, near, stuttgart, germany, dated, to, the, 6th, century, bce, was, excavated, and, found, to, have, not, only, greek, bronzes, but, also, chinese, silks, similar, animal, shaped, pieces, of, art, and, wrestler, motifs, on, belts, have, been, found, in, scythian, grave, sites, stretching, from, the, black, sea, region, all, the, way, to, warring, states, era, archaeological, sites, in, inner, mongolia, at, aluchaideng, and, shaanxi, at, keshengzhuang, in, china, the, expansion, of, scythian, cultures, stretching, from, the, hungarian, plain, and, the, carpathian, mountains, to, the, chinese, gansu, corridor, and, linking, the, middle, east, with, northern, india, and, the, punjab, undoubtedly, played, an, important, role, in, the, development, of, the, silk, road, scythians, accompanied, the, assyrian, esarhaddon, on, his, invasion, of, egypt, and, their, distinctive, triangular, arrowheads, have, been, found, as, far, south, as, aswan, these, nomadic, peoples, were, dependent, upon, neighbouring, settled, populations, for, a, number, of, important, technologies, and, in, addition, to, raiding, vulnerable, settlements, for, these, commodities, they, also, encouraged, long, distance, merchants, as, a, source, of, income, through, the, enforced, payment, of, tariffs, sogdians, played, a, major, role, in, facilitating, trade, between, china, and, central, asia, along, the, silk, roads, as, late, as, the, 10th, century, their, language, serving, as, a, lingua, franca, for, asian, trade, as, far, back, as, the, 4th, century, the, silk, road, was, initiated, and, spread, by, china, s, han, dynasty, through, exploration, and, conquests, in, central, asia, with, the, mediterranean, linked, to, the, fergana, valley, the, next, step, was, to, open, a, route, across, the, tarim, basin, and, the, hexi, corridor, to, china, proper, this, extension, came, around, 130, bce, with, the, embassies, of, the, han, dynasty, to, central, asia, following, the, reports, of, the, ambassador, zhang, qian, who, was, originally, sent, to, obtain, an, alliance, with, the, yuezhi, against, the, xiongnu, zhang, qian, visited, directly, the, kingdom, of, dayuan, in, ferghana, the, territories, of, the, yuezhi, in, transoxiana, the, bactrian, country, of, daxia, with, its, remnants, of, greco, bactrian, rule, and, kangju, he, also, made, reports, on, neighbouring, countries, that, he, did, not, visit, such, as, anxi, parthia, tiaozhi, mesopotamia, shendu, indian, subcontinent, and, the, wusun, zhang, qian, s, report, suggested, the, economic, reason, for, chinese, expansion, and, wall, building, westward, and, trail, blazed, the, silk, road, making, it, one, of, the, most, famous, trade, routes, in, history, and, in, the, world, after, winning, the, war, of, the, heavenly, horses, and, the, han, xiongnu, war, chinese, armies, established, themselves, in, central, asia, initiating, the, silk, route, as, a, major, avenue, of, international, trade, some, say, that, the, chinese, emperor, wu, became, interested, in, developing, commercial, relationships, with, the, sophisticated, urban, civilizations, of, ferghana, bactria, and, the, parthian, empire, the, son, of, heaven, on, hearing, all, this, reasoned, thus, ferghana, dayuan, great, ionians, and, the, possessions, of, bactria, ta, hsia, and, parthian, empire, anxi, are, large, countries, full, of, rare, things, with, a, population, living, in, fixed, abodes, and, given, to, occupations, somewhat, identical, with, those, of, the, chinese, people, but, with, weak, armies, and, placing, great, value, on, the, rich, produce, of, china, hou, hanshu, later, han, history, others, say, that, emperor, wu, was, mainly, interested, in, fighting, the, xiongnu, and, that, major, trade, began, only, after, the, chinese, pacified, the, hexi, corridor, the, chinese, were, also, strongly, attracted, by, the, tall, and, powerful, horses, named, heavenly, horses, in, the, possession, of, the, dayuan, literally, the, great, ionians, the, greek, kingdoms, of, central, asia, which, were, of, capital, importance, in, fighting, the, nomadic, xiongnu, they, defeated, the, dayuan, in, the, han, dayuan, war, the, chinese, subsequently, sent, numerous, embassies, around, ten, every, year, to, these, countries, and, as, far, as, seleucid, syria, thus, more, embassies, were, dispatched, to, anxi, yancai, lijian, tiaozhi, mesopotamia, and, tianzhu, as, a, rule, rather, more, than, ten, such, missions, went, forward, in, the, course, of, a, year, and, at, the, least, five, or, six, hou, hanshu, later, han, history, these, connections, marked, the, beginning, of, the, silk, road, trade, network, that, extended, to, the, roman, empire, the, chinese, campaigned, in, central, asia, on, several, occasions, and, direct, encounters, between, han, troops, and, roman, legionaries, probably, captured, or, recruited, as, mercenaries, by, the, xiong, nu, are, recorded, particularly, in, the, 36, bce, battle, of, sogdiana, joseph, needham, sidney, shapiro, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, chinese, crossbow, was, transmitted, to, the, roman, world, on, such, occasions, although, the, greek, gastraphetes, provides, an, alternative, origin, r, ernest, dupuy, and, trevor, n, dupuy, suggest, that, in, 36, bce, han, expedition, into, central, asia, west, of, jaxartes, river, apparently, encountered, and, defeated, a, contingent, of, roman, legionaries, the, romans, may, have, been, part, of, antony, s, army, invading, parthia, sogdiana, modern, bukhara, east, of, the, oxus, river, on, the, polytimetus, river, was, apparently, the, most, easterly, penetration, ever, made, by, roman, forces, in, asia, the, margin, of, chinese, victory, appears, to, have, been, their, crossbows, whose, bolts, and, darts, seem, easily, to, have, penetrated, roman, shields, and, armour, the, han, dynasty, army, regularly, policed, the, trade, route, against, nomadic, bandit, forces, generally, identified, as, xiongnu, han, general, ban, chao, led, an, army, of, 70, 000, mounted, infantry, and, light, cavalry, troops, in, the, 1st, century, ce, to, secure, the, trade, routes, reaching, far, west, to, the, tarim, basin, ban, chao, expanded, his, conquests, across, the, pamirs, to, the, shores, of, the, caspian, sea, and, the, borders, of, parthia, it, was, from, here, that, the, han, general, dispatched, envoy, gan, ying, to, daqin, rome, the, silk, road, essentially, came, into, being, from, the, 1st, century, bce, following, these, efforts, by, china, to, consolidate, a, road, to, the, western, world, and, india, both, through, direct, settlements, in, the, area, of, the, tarim, basin, and, diplomatic, relations, with, the, countries, of, the, dayuan, parthians, and, bactrians, further, west, the, silk, roads, were, a, complex, network, of, trade, routes, that, gave, people, the, chance, to, exchange, goods, and, culture, a, maritime, silk, route, opened, up, between, chinese, controlled, giao, ch, centred, in, modern, vietnam, near, hanoi, probably, by, the, 1st, century, it, extended, via, ports, on, the, coasts, of, india, and, sri, lanka, all, the, way, to, roman, controlled, ports, in, roman, egypt, and, the, nabataean, territories, on, the, northeastern, coast, of, the, red, sea, the, earliest, roman, glassware, bowl, found, in, china, was, unearthed, from, a, western, han, tomb, in, guangzhou, dated, to,

according, to, a, semi, legendary, account, of, an, ambassador, sent, to, the, west, by, the, chinese, emperor, ming, 58, 75, during, this, period, buddhism, began, to, spread, throughout, southeast, east, and, central, asia, mahayana, theravada, and, vajrayana, are, the, three, primary, forms, of, buddhism, that, spread, across, asia, via, the, silk, road, the, buddhist, movement, was, the,

the, middle, of, the, third, century, extensive, contacts, started, in, the, 2nd, century, probably, as, a, consequence, of, the, expansion, of, the, kushan, empire, into, the, chinese, territory, of, the, tarim, basin, due, to, the, missionary, efforts, of, a, great, number, of, buddhist, monks, to, chinese, lands, the, first, missionaries, and, translators, of, buddhists, scriptures, into,
