https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_culture
the, clovis, culture, is, an, archaeological, culture, from, the, paleoindian, period, of, north, america, spanning, around, 13, 050, to, 12, 750, years, before, present, bp, the, type, site, is, blackwater, draw, locality, no, 1, near, clovis, new, mexico, where, stone, tools, were, found, alongside, the, remains, of, columbian, mammoths, in, 1929, clovis, sites, have, been, found, across, north, america, the, most, distinctive, part, of, the, clovis, culture, toolkit, are, clovis, points, which, are, projectile, points, with, a, fluted, lanceolate, shape, clovis, points, are, typically, large, sometimes, exceeding, 10, centimetres, 3, 9, in, in, length, these, points, were, multifunctional, also, serving, as, cutting, tools, other, stone, tools, used, by, the, clovis, culture, include, knives, scrapers, and, bifacial, tools, with, bone, tools, including, beveled, rods, and, shaft, wrenches, with, possible, ivory, points, also, being, identified, hides, wood, and, natural, fibers, may, also, have, been, utilized, though, no, direct, evidence, of, this, has, been, preserved, clovis, artifacts, are, often, found, grouped, together, in, caches, where, they, had, been, stored, for, later, retrieval, and, over, 20, clovis, caches, have, been, identified, the, clovis, peoples, are, thought, to, have, been, highly, mobile, groups, of, hunter, gatherers, it, is, generally, agreed, that, these, groups, were, reliant, on, hunting, big, game, megafauna, having, a, particularly, strong, association, with, mammoths, and, to, a, lesser, extent, with, mastodon, bison, camel, and, horse, but, they, also, consumed, smaller, animals, and, plants, the, clovis, hunters, may, have, contributed, to, the, late, pleistocene, megafauna, extinctions, in, north, america, though, this, idea, has, been, subject, to, controversy, only, one, human, burial, has, been, directly, associated, with, tools, from, the, clovis, culture, anzick, 1, a, young, boy, found, buried, in, montana, who, has, a, close, genetic, relation, to, some, modern, native, american, populations, primarily, in, central, and, south, america, the, clovis, culture, represents, the, earliest, widely, recognised, archaeological, culture, in, north, america, though, in, western, north, america, it, appears, to, have, been, contemporaneous, with, the, western, stemmed, tradition, while, historically, many, scholars, held, to, a, clovis, first, model, where, clovis, represented, the, earliest, inhabitants, in, the, americas, today, this, is, largely, rejected, with, several, generally, accepted, sites, across, the, americas, like, monte, verde, ii, being, dated, to, at, least, a, thousand, years, earlier, than, the, oldest, clovis, sites, the, end, of, the, clovis, culture, may, have, been, driven, by, the, decline, of, the, megafauna, that, the, clovis, hunted, as, well, as, decreasing, mobility, resulting, in, local, differentiation, of, lithic, and, cultural, traditions, across, north, america, beginning, around, 12, 750, 12, 600, years, bp, the, clovis, culture, was, succeeded, by, more, regional, cultures, including, the, folsom, tradition, in, central, north, america, the, cumberland, point, in, mid, southern, north, america, the, suwannee, and, simpson, points, in, the, southeast, and, gainey, points, in, the, northeast, great, lakes, region, the, clovis, and, folsom, traditions, may, have, overlapped, perhaps, for, around, 80, 400, years, the, end, of, the, clovis, culture, is, generally, thought, be, the, result, of, normal, cultural, change, over, time, in, south, america, the, widespread, similar, fishtail, or, fell, point, style, was, contemporaneous, to, the, usage, of, clovis, points, in, north, america, and, possibly, developed, from, clovis, points, on, august, 29, 1927, the, first, evidence, of, pleistocene, humans, seen, by, multiple, archaeologists, in, the, americas, was, discovered, near, folsom, new, mexico, at, this, site, they, found, the, first, in, situ, folsom, point, with, the, bones, of, the, extinct, bison, species, bison, antiquus, this, confirmation, of, a, human, presence, in, the, americas, during, the, pleistocene, inspired, many, people, to, start, looking, for, evidence, of, early, humans, in, 1929, 19, year, old, ridgely, whiteman, who, had, been, closely, following, the, excavations, in, nearby, folsom, in, the, newspapers, discovered, the, clovis, site, near, the, blackwater, draw, in, eastern, new, mexico, despite, several, earlier, paleoindian, discoveries, the, best, documented, evidence, of, the, clovis, complex, was, collected, and, excavated, between, 1932, and, 1937, near, clovis, new, mexico, by, a, crew, under, the, direction, of, edgar, billings, howard, until, 1935, and, later, by, john, l, cotter, from, the, academy, of, natural, sciences, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, howard, s, crew, left, their, excavation, in, burnet, cave, the, first, professionally, excavated, clovis, site, in, august, 1932, and, visited, whiteman, and, his, blackwater, draw, site, by, november, howard, was, back, at, blackwater, draw, to, investigate, additional, finds, from, a, construction, project, the, american, journal, of, archaeology, in, its, january, march, 1932, edition, mentions, howard, s, work, in, burnet, cave, including, the, discovery, of, extinct, fauna, and, a, folsom, type, point, 4, ft, below, a, basketmaker, burial, reference, is, made, to, a, slightly, earlier, article, on, burnet, cave, in, the, university, museum, bulletin, from, november, 1931, the, dent, site, in, colorado, was, the, first, known, association, of, clovis, points, with, mammoth, bones, as, noted, by, hannah, marie, wormington, in, her, book, ancient, man, in, north, america, 4th, ed, 1957, gary, haynes, in, his, book, the, early, settlement, of, north, america, suggested, the, type, of, fluted, point, thereafter, associated, with, megafauna, especially, mammoths, at, over, a, dozen, other, archaeological, sites, in, north, america, would, have, been, more, appropriately, named, dent, rather, than, clovis, the, town, near, blackwater, draw, that, gave, the, type, of, point, its, name, a, feature, considered, to, be, distinctive, of, the, clovis, tradition, is, overshot, flaking, which, is, defined, as, flakes, that, during, the, manufacture, of, a, biface, are, struck, from, prepared, edges, of, a, piece, and, travel, from, one, edge, across, the, face, with, limited, removal, of, the, opposite, edge, whether, or, not, the, overshot, flaking, was, intentional, on, the, part, of, the, stoneknapper, has, been, contested, with, other, authors, suggesting, that, overface, flaking, where, flakes, that, travel, past, the, midline, but, terminate, before, reaching, the, opposite, end, are, removed, was, the, primary, goal, other, elements, considered, distinctive, of, the, clovis, culture, tool, complex, include, raw, material, selectivity, distinctive, patterns, of, flake, and, blade, platform, preparation, thinning, and, flaking, characteristic, biface, size, and, morphology, including, the, presence, of, end, thinning, and, the, size, curvature, and, reduction, strategies, of, blades, it, has, long, been, recognised, that, the, definition, of, the, clovis, culture, is, to, a, degree, ambiguous, the, term, being, used, in, a, number, of, ways, referring, to, an, era, to, a, culture, and, most, specifically, to, a, distinctive, projectile, point, type, with, disagreement, between, scholars, about, distinguishing, between, clovis, and, various, other, paleoindian, archaeological, cultures, a, hallmark, of, the, toolkit, associated, with, the, clovis, culture, is, the, distinctively, shaped, lithic, point, known, as, the, clovis, point, clovis, points, are, bifacial, having, flakes, removed, from, both, faces, and, typically, fluted, having, an, elongate, flake, removed, from, the, base, of, the, point, on, both, sides, with, the, fluting, typically, running, up, a, third, or, a, half, of, the, length, of, the, point, distinct, from, many, later, paleoindian, traditions, where, the, flute, runs, up, the, entire, point, length, clovis, points, are, typically, parallel, sided, to, slightly, convex, with, the, base, of, the, point, being, concave, although, no, direct, evidence, of, what, was, attached, to, clovis, points, has, been, found, clovis, points, are, commonly, thought, to, have, served, as, tips, for, spears, darts, likely, used, as, handheld, thrusting, or, throwing, weapons, possibly, in, combination, with, a, spear, thrower, for, hunting, and, possibly, self, defense, wear, on, clovis, points, indicates, that, they, were, multifunctional, objects, that, also, served, as, cutting, and, slicing, tools, with, some, authors, suggesting, that, some, clovis, point, types, were, primarily, used, as, knives, clovis, points, were, at, least, sometimes, resharpened, though, the, idea, that, they, were, continually, resharpened, long, life, tools, has, been, questioned, the, shape, and, size, of, clovis, points, varies, significantly, over, space, and, time, the, largest, points, exceed, 10, centimetres, 3, 9, in, in, length, the, points, required, considerable, effort, to, make, and, often, broke, during, knapping, particularly, during, fluting, the, fluting, may, have, served, to, make, the, finished, points, more, durable, during, use, by, acting, as, a, shock, absorber, to, redistribute, stress, during, impact, though, others, have, suggested, that, it, may, have, been, purely, stylistic, or, used, to, strengthen, the, hafting, to, the, spear, handle, the, points, were, generally, produced, from, nodules, or, siliceous, cryptocrystalline, rocks, clovis, points, were, thinned, using, end, thinning, the, removal, of, blade, like, flakes, parallel, to, the, long, axis, they, were, initially, prepared, using, percussion, flaking, with, the, point, being, finished, using, pressure, flaking, clovis, blades, long, flakes, removed, from, specially, prepared, conical, or, wedge, shaped, cores, are, part, of, the, global, upper, paleolithic, blade, tradition, clovis, blades, are, twice, as, long, as, they, are, wide, and, were, used, and, modified, to, create, a, variety, of, tools, including, endscrapers, used, to, scrape, hides, serrated, tools, and, gravers, unlike, bifaces, clovis, blade, cores, do, not, appear, to, have, been, regularly, transported, over, long, distances, with, only, the, blades, typically, carried, in, the, mobile, toolkit, bifaces, served, a, variety, of, roles, for, clovis, hunter, gatherers, such, as, cutting, tools, preforms, for, formal, tools, such, as, points, and, as, portable, sources, of, large, flakes, useful, as, preforms, or, tools, other, tools, associated, with, the, clovis, culture, are, adzes, likely, used, for, woodworking, bone, shaft, wrenches, suggested, to, have, been, used, to, straighten, wooden, shafts, as, well, as, rods, some, of, which, have, beveled, diagonally, cut, ends, these, rods, are, made, of, bone, antlers, and, ivory, the, function, of, the, rods, is, unknown, and, has, been, subject, to, numerous, hypotheses, rods, that, were, beveled, on, both, ends, are, most, often, interpreted, as, foreshafts, to, which, stone, points, were, hafted, with, a, pair, of, rods, surrounding, each, side, of, the, point, while, rods, that, are, beveled, on, only, one, end, with, the, other, being, pointed, are, most, often, intepreted, as, projectile, points, the, rods, may, have, served, other, purposes, such, as, prybars, clovis, people, are, also, known, to, have, used, ivory, and, bone, to, create, projectile, points, a, distinctive, feature, of, the, clovis, culture, generally, not, found, in, subsequent, cultures, is, caching, where, a, collection, of, artifacts, typically, stone, tools, such, as, clovis, points, or, bifaces, were, deliberately, left, at, a, location, presumably, with, the, intention, to, return, to, collect, them, later, though, some, authors, have, interpreted, cache, deposits, as, ritual, behavior, over, twenty, such, caches, have, been, identified, across, north, america, a, few, clovis, culture, artifacts, are, suspected, to, reflect, creative, expression, such, as, rock, art, the, use, of, red, ochre, and, engraved, stones, the, best, known, examples, of, this, were, found, at, the, gault, site, in, texas, and, consist, of, limestone, nodules, incised, with, expressive, geometric, patterns, some, of, which, mimic, leaf, patterns, clovis, peoples, like, other, paleoindian, cultures, used, red, ocher, for, a, variety, of, artistic, and, ritual, purposes, including, burials, and, to, cover, objects, in, caches, clovis, peoples, are, known, to, have, transported, ocher, 100, kilometres, 62, mi, from, its, original, outcrop, they, are, also, suggested, to, have, produced, beads, out, of, animal, bones, clovis, hunter, gatherers, are, characterized, as, high, technology, foragers, who, utilized, sophisticated, technology, to, maintain, access, to, resources, under, conditions, of, high, mobility, in, many, clovis, localities, the, stone, tools, found, at, a, site, were, hundreds, of, kilometers, away, from, the, source, stone, outcrop, in, one, case, over, 900, kilometres, 560, mi, away, the, people, who, produced, the, clovis, culture, probably, had, a, low, population, density, but, with, geographically, extensive, cultural, networks, the, clovis, culture, is, suggested, to, have, heavily, utilized, hides, wood, and, natural, fibres, though, no, direct, evidence, of, this, has, been, preserved, clovis, culture, artifacts, have, often, been, found, associated, with, big, game, including, proboscideans, columbian, mammoth, mastodon, and, the, gomphothere, cuvieronius, bison, equines, of, the, genus, equus, and, the, extinct, camel, camelops, a, handful, of, sites, possibly, suggest, the, hunting, of, caribou, reindeer, peccaries, platygonus, mylohyus, ground, sloths, paramylodon, glyptodonts, glyptotherium, tapirs, and, the, llama, hemiauchenia, proboscideans, especially, mammoths, are, the, most, common, recorded, species, found, in, clovis, sites, followed, by, bison, however, the, clovis, culture, is, not, exclusively, associated, with, large, animals, with, several, sites, showing, the, exploitation, of, small, game, like, tortoises, and, jackrabbits, it, is, generally, agreed, that, the, people, who, produced, the, clovis, culture, were, reliant, on, big, game, for, a, significant, portion, of, their, diet, while, also, consuming, smaller, animals, and, plants, though, to, what, degree, they, were, reliant, on, megafauna, is, disputed, with, some, authors, arguing, for, a, generalist, hunter, gatherer, lifestyle, that, also, involved, the, occasional, targeting, of, megafauna, the, effectiveness, of, clovis, tools, for, hunting, proboscideans, has, been, contested, by, some, authors, though, others, have, asserted, that, clovis, points, were, likely, capable, of, killing, proboscideans, noting, that, replica, clovis, points, have, been, able, to, penetrate, elephant, hide, in, experimental, tests, and, that, groups, of, hunter, gatherers, in, africa, have, been, observed, killing, elephants, using, spears, in, the, southern, plains, clovis, people, created, campsites, of, considerable, size, which, are, often, on, the, periphery, of, the, region, near, sources, of, workable, stone, from, which, they, are, suggested, to, have, seasonally, migrated, into, the, plains, to, hunt, megafauna, in, the, southeast, clovis, peoples, created, large, camps, that, may, have, served, as, staging, areas, which, may, have, been, seasonally, occupied, where, a, number, of, bands, may, have, gathered, for, social, occasions, at, jake, bluff, in, northern, oklahoma, clovis, points, are, associated, with, numerous, butchered, bison, antiquus, bones, which, represented, a, bison, herd, of, at, least, 22, individuals, at, the, time, of, deposition, the, site, was, a, steep, sided, arroyo, dry, watercourse, that, formed, a, dead, end, suggesting, that, hunters, trapped, the, bison, herd, within, the, arroyo, before, killing, them, beginning, in, the, 1950s, paul, s, martin, proposed, the, overkill, hypothesis, suggesting, that, the, late, pleistocene, megafauna, extinctions, in, north, america, were, driven, by, human, hunting, including, by, clovis, peoples, with, the, hunting, and, extinction, of, large, herbivores, having, a, knock, on, effect, causing, the, extinction, of, large, carnivores, this, suggestion, has, been, the, subject, of, controversy, the, timing, of, megafauna, extinction, in, north, america, also, coincides, with, major, climatic, changes, making, it, difficult, to, disentangle, the, effects, of, various, factors, in, a, 2012, survey, of, archaeologists, in, the, saa, archaeological, record, 63, of, respondents, said, that, megafauna, extinctions, were, likely, the, result, of, a, combination, of, factors, the, only, known, clovis, burial, is, that, of, anzick, 1, an, infant, boy, who, was, found, near, wilsall, montana, in, 1968, the, body, was, associated, with, over, 100, stone, and, bone, artifacts, all, of, which, were, stained, with, red, ocher, and, it, dates, to, approximately, 12, 990, 12, 840, years, bp, sequencing, of, his, genome, demonstrates, that, he, belonged, to, a, population, that, is, ancestral, to, many, contemporary, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, particularly, those, from, central, and, south, america, and, less, related, to, those, from, contemporary, north, america, including, northern, mexico, though, there, is, considerable, variability, in, the, genetic, closeness, of, central, and, south, american, indigenous, peoples, to, anzick, 1, with, older, ancient, south, american, remains, generally, being, closer, suggesting, that, the, native, american, population, had, already, diverged, into, multiple, genetically, distinct, groups, by, the, time, of, the, clovis, culture, followed, by, subsequent, migration, of, these, populations, later, in, the, holocene, like, other, native, americans, anzick, 1, is, closely, related, to, siberian, peoples, confirming, the, asian, origin, of, the, clovis, culture, he, belongs, to, y, chromosome, haplogroup, q, l54, which, is, common, among, contemporary, native, americans, and, to, mitochondrial, haplogroup, d4h3a, which, is, rare, among, contemporary, native, americans, occurring, in, only, 1, 4, primarily, along, the, pacific, coast, but, more, common, in, the, very, earliest, indigenous, americans, some, authors, have, suggested, that, the, clovis, culture, lasted, for, a, relatively, short, period, of, a, few, centuries, with, a, 2020, study, suggesting, a, temporal, range, based, on, ten, securely, radiocarbon, dated, clovis, sites, of, 13, 050, to, 12, 750, calibrated, years, bp, ending, subsequent, to, the, onset, of, the, younger, dryas, consistent, with, the, results, obtained, in, a, 2007, study, by, the, same, authors, other, authors, have, argued, that, some, sites, extend, the, range, of, the, clovis, culture, back, to, 13, 500, years, bp, though, the, dating, for, these, earlier, sites, is, not, secure, some, scholars, have, supported, a, long, chronology, for, clovis, of, around, 1, 500, years, historically, many, authors, argued, for, a, clovis, first, paradigm, where, clovis, which, represents, the, earliest, recognisable, archaeological, culture, in, north, america, were, suggested, to, represent, the, earliest, inhabitants, of, the, americas, south, of, the, laurentide, ice, sheet, however, since, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, this, hypothesis, has, been, abandoned, by, most, researchers, as, several, widely, accepted, sites, notably, monte, verde, ii, in, chile, c, 14, 500, years, bp, as, well, as, paisley, caves, in, oregon, c, 14, 200, years, bp, and, cooper, s, ferry, in, idaho, c, 15, 800, years, bp, are, suggested, to, be, considerably, older, than, the, oldest, clovis, sites, historically, it, was, suggested, that, the, ancestors, of, the, people, who, produced, the, clovis, culture, migrated, into, north, america, along, the, ice, free, corridor, but, many, later, scholars, have, suggested, that, a, migration, along, the, pacific, coast, is, more, likely, the, clovis, culture, is, known, from, localities, across, north, america, from, southern, canada, to, northern, mexico, and, across, the, east, and, west, of, the, continent, the, area, of, its, origin, remains, unclear, though, the, development, of, fluted, clovis, points, appears, to, have, occurred, in, north, america, south, of, the, laurentide, ice, sheet, and, not, in, beringia, the, clovis, culture, may, have, originated, from, the, dyuktai, lithic, style, widespread, in, beringia, while, some, authors, have, suggested, that, the, clovis, culture, resulted, from, diffusion, of, traditions, through, an, already, pre, existing, paleoindian, population, others, have, asserted, that, the, culture, likely, originated, from, the, expansion, of, a, single, population, in, western, north, america, the, clovis, culture, was, contemporaneous, with, and, perhaps, preceded, by, the, western, stemmed, tradition, which, produced, unfluted, projectile, points, with, the, western, stemmed, tradition, continuing, in, the, region, for, several, thousand, years, after, the, end, of, clovis, the, end, of, the, clovis, culture, may, have, been, driven, by, the, decline, of, the, megafauna, that, the, clovis, hunted, as, well, as, decreasing, mobility, resulting, in, local, differentiation, of, lithic, and, cultural, traditions, across, north, america, this, is, generally, considered, to, be, the, result, of, normal, cultural, change, through, time, there, is, no, evidence, that, the, disappearance, of, the, clovis, culture, was, the, result, of, the, onset, of, the, younger, dryas, or, that, there, was, a, population, decline, of, paleoindians, following, the, end, of, the, clovis, culture, the, clovis, culture, was, succeeded, by, various, regional, point, styles, such, as, the, folsom, tradition, in, central, north, america, the, cumberland, point, in, mid, southern, north, america, the, suwannee, and, simpson, points, in, the, southeast, and, the, gainey, points, in, the, northeast, great, lakes, region, the, clovis, and, folsom, traditions, may, have, overlapped, perhaps, for, around, 80, 400, years, a, number, of, authors, have, suggested, that, the, clovis, culture, is, ancestral, to, other, fluted, point, producing, cultures, in, central, and, south, america, like, the, widespread, fishtail, or, fell, point, style
