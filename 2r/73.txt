the, mesolithic, greek, mesos, middle, lithos, stone, or, middle, stone, age, is, the, old, world, archaeological, period, between, the, upper, paleolithic, and, the, neolithic, the, term, epipaleolithic, is, often, used, synonymously, especially, for, outside, northern, europe, and, for, the, corresponding, period, in, the, levant, and, caucasus, the, mesolithic, has, different, time, spans, in, different, parts, of, eurasia, it, refers, to, the, final, period, of, hunter, gatherer, cultures, in, europe, and, the, middle, east, between, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, maximum, and, the, neolithic, revolution, in, europe, it, spans, roughly, 15, 000, to, 5, 000, bp, in, the, middle, east, the, epipalaeolithic, near, east, roughly, 20, 000, to, 10, 000, bp, the, term, is, less, used, of, areas, farther, east, and, not, at, all, beyond, eurasia, and, north, africa, the, type, of, culture, associated, with, the, mesolithic, varies, between, areas, but, it, is, associated, with, a, decline, in, the, group, hunting, of, large, animals, in, favour, of, a, broader, hunter, gatherer, way, of, life, and, the, development, of, more, sophisticated, and, typically, smaller, lithic, tools, and, weapons, than, the, heavy, chipped, equivalents, typical, of, the, paleolithic, depending, on, the, region, some, use, of, pottery, and, textiles, may, be, found, in, sites, allocated, to, the, mesolithic, but, generally, indications, of, agriculture, are, taken, as, marking, transition, into, the, neolithic, the, more, permanent, settlements, tend, to, be, close, to, the, sea, or, inland, waters, offering, a, good, supply, of, food, mesolithic, societies, are, not, seen, as, very, complex, and, burials, are, fairly, simple, in, contrast, grandiose, burial, mounds, are, a, mark, of, the, neolithic, the, terms, paleolithic, and, neolithic, were, introduced, by, john, lubbock, in, his, work, pre, historic, times, in, 1865, the, additional, mesolithic, category, was, added, as, an, intermediate, category, by, hodder, westropp, in, 1866, westropp, s, suggestion, was, immediately, controversial, a, british, school, led, by, john, evans, denied, any, need, for, an, intermediate, the, ages, blended, together, like, the, colors, of, a, rainbow, he, said, a, european, school, led, by, gabriel, de, mortillet, asserted, that, there, was, a, gap, between, the, earlier, and, later, edouard, piette, claimed, to, have, filled, the, gap, with, his, naming, of, the, azilian, culture, knut, stjerna, offered, an, alternative, in, the, epipaleolithic, suggesting, a, final, phase, of, the, paleolithic, rather, than, an, intermediate, age, in, its, own, right, inserted, between, the, paleolithic, and, neolithic, by, the, time, of, vere, gordon, childe, s, work, the, dawn, of, europe, 1947, which, affirms, the, mesolithic, sufficient, data, had, been, collected, to, determine, that, a, transitional, period, between, the, paleolithic, and, the, neolithic, was, indeed, a, useful, concept, however, the, terms, mesolithic, and, epipalaeolithic, remain, in, competition, with, varying, conventions, of, usage, in, the, archaeology, of, northern, europe, for, example, for, archaeological, sites, in, great, britain, germany, scandinavia, ukraine, and, russia, the, term, mesolithic, is, almost, always, used, in, the, archaeology, of, other, areas, the, term, epipaleolithic, may, be, preferred, by, most, authors, or, there, may, be, divergences, between, authors, over, which, term, to, use, or, what, meaning, to, assign, to, each, in, the, new, world, neither, term, is, used, except, provisionally, in, the, arctic, epipaleolithic, is, sometimes, also, used, alongside, mesolithic, for, the, final, end, of, the, upper, paleolithic, immediately, followed, by, the, mesolithic, as, mesolithic, suggests, an, intermediate, period, followed, by, the, neolithic, some, authors, prefer, the, term, epipaleolithic, for, hunter, gatherer, cultures, who, are, not, succeeded, by, agricultural, traditions, reserving, mesolithic, for, cultures, who, are, clearly, succeeded, by, the, neolithic, revolution, such, as, the, natufian, culture, other, authors, use, mesolithic, as, a, generic, term, for, hunter, gatherer, cultures, after, the, last, glacial, maximum, whether, they, are, transitional, towards, agriculture, or, not, in, addition, terminology, appears, to, differ, between, archaeological, sub, disciplines, with, mesolithic, being, widely, used, in, european, archaeology, while, epipalaeolithic, is, more, common, in, near, eastern, archaeology, the, balkan, mesolithic, begins, around, 15, 000, years, ago, in, western, europe, the, early, mesolithic, or, azilian, begins, about, 14, 000, years, ago, in, the, franco, cantabrian, region, of, northern, spain, and, southern, france, in, other, parts, of, europe, the, mesolithic, begins, by, 11, 500, years, ago, the, beginning, of, the, holocene, and, it, ends, with, the, introduction, of, farming, depending, on, the, region, between, c, 8, 500, and, 5, 500, years, ago, regions, that, experienced, greater, environmental, effects, as, the, last, glacial, period, ended, have, a, much, more, apparent, mesolithic, era, lasting, millennia, in, northern, europe, for, example, societies, were, able, to, live, well, on, rich, food, supplies, from, the, marshlands, created, by, the, warmer, climate, such, conditions, produced, distinctive, human, behaviors, that, are, preserved, in, the, material, record, such, as, the, maglemosian, and, azilian, cultures, such, conditions, also, delayed, the, coming, of, the, neolithic, until, some, 5, 500, bp, in, northern, europe, the, type, of, stone, toolkit, remains, one, of, the, most, diagnostic, features, the, mesolithic, used, a, microlithic, technology, composite, devices, manufactured, with, mode, v, chipped, stone, tools, microliths, while, the, paleolithic, had, utilized, modes, i, iv, in, some, areas, however, such, as, ireland, parts, of, portugal, the, isle, of, man, and, the, tyrrhenian, islands, a, macrolithic, technology, was, used, in, the, mesolithic, in, the, neolithic, the, microlithic, technology, was, replaced, by, a, macrolithic, technology, with, an, increased, use, of, polished, stone, tools, such, as, stone, axes, there, is, some, evidence, for, the, beginning, of, construction, at, sites, with, a, ritual, or, astronomical, significance, including, stonehenge, with, a, short, row, of, large, post, holes, aligned, east, west, and, a, possible, lunar, calendar, at, warren, field, in, scotland, with, pits, of, post, holes, of, varying, sizes, thought, to, reflect, the, lunar, phases, both, are, dated, to, before, c, 9, 000, bp, the, 8th, millennium, bc, an, ancient, chewed, gum, made, from, the, pitch, of, birch, bark, revealed, that, a, woman, enjoyed, a, meal, of, hazelnuts, and, duck, about, 5, 700, years, ago, in, southern, denmark, mesolithic, people, influenced, europe, s, forests, by, bringing, favored, plants, like, hazel, with, them, as, the, neolithic, package, including, farming, herding, polished, stone, axes, timber, longhouses, and, pottery, spread, into, europe, the, mesolithic, way, of, life, was, marginalized, and, eventually, disappeared, mesolithic, adaptations, such, as, sedentism, population, size, and, use, of, plant, foods, are, cited, as, evidence, of, the, transition, to, agriculture, other, mesolithic, communities, rejected, the, neolithic, package, likely, as, a, result, of, ideological, reluctance, different, worldviews, and, an, active, rejection, of, the, sedentary, farming, lifestyle, in, one, sample, from, the, bl, tterh, hle, in, hagen, it, seems, that, the, descendants, of, mesolithic, people, maintained, a, foraging, lifestyle, for, more, than, 2000, years, after, the, arrival, of, farming, societies, in, the, area, such, societies, may, be, called, subneolithic, for, hunter, gatherer, communities, long, term, close, contact, and, integration, in, existing, farming, communities, facilitated, the, adoption, of, a, farming, lifestyle, the, integration, of, these, hunter, gatherer, in, farming, communities, was, made, possible, by, their, socially, open, character, towards, new, members, in, north, eastern, europe, the, hunting, and, fishing, lifestyle, continued, into, the, medieval, period, in, regions, less, suited, to, agriculture, and, in, scandinavia, no, mesolithic, period, may, be, accepted, with, the, locally, preferred, older, stone, age, moving, into, the, younger, stone, age, compared, to, the, preceding, upper, paleolithic, and, the, following, neolithic, there, is, rather, less, surviving, art, from, the, mesolithic, the, rock, art, of, the, iberian, mediterranean, basin, which, probably, spreads, across, from, the, upper, paleolithic, is, a, widespread, phenomenon, much, less, well, known, than, the, cave, paintings, of, the, upper, paleolithic, with, which, it, makes, an, interesting, contrast, the, sites, are, now, mostly, cliff, faces, in, the, open, air, and, the, subjects, are, now, mostly, human, rather, than, animal, with, large, groups, of, small, figures, there, are, 45, figures, at, roca, dels, moros, clothing, is, shown, and, scenes, of, dancing, fighting, hunting, and, food, gathering, the, figures, are, much, smaller, than, the, animals, of, paleolithic, art, and, depicted, much, more, schematically, though, often, in, energetic, poses, a, few, small, engraved, pendants, with, suspension, holes, and, simple, engraved, designs, are, known, some, from, northern, europe, in, amber, and, one, from, star, carr, in, britain, in, shale, the, elk, s, head, of, huittinen, is, a, rare, mesolithic, animal, carving, in, soapstone, from, finland, the, rock, art, in, the, urals, appears, to, show, similar, changes, after, the, paleolithic, and, the, wooden, shigir, idol, is, a, rare, survival, of, what, may, well, have, been, a, very, common, material, for, sculpture, it, is, a, plank, of, larch, carved, with, geometric, motifs, but, topped, with, a, human, head, now, in, fragments, it, would, apparently, have, been, over, 5, metres, tall, when, made, the, ain, sakhri, figurine, from, palestine, is, a, natufian, carving, in, calcite, a, total, of, 33, antler, frontlets, have, been, discovered, at, star, carr, these, are, red, deer, skulls, modified, to, be, worn, by, humans, modified, frontlets, have, also, been, discovered, at, bedburg, k, nigshoven, hohen, viecheln, plau, and, berlin, biesdorf, weaving, techniques, were, deployed, to, create, shoes, and, baskets, the, latter, being, of, fine, construction, and, decorated, with, dyes, examples, have, been, found, in, cueva, de, los, murci, lagos, in, southern, spain, that, in, 2023, were, dated, to, 9, 500, years, ago, in, north, eastern, europe, siberia, and, certain, southern, european, and, north, african, sites, a, ceramic, mesolithic, can, be, distinguished, between, c, 9, 000, to, 5, 850, bp, russian, archaeologists, prefer, to, describe, such, pottery, making, cultures, as, neolithic, even, though, farming, is, absent, this, pottery, making, mesolithic, culture, can, be, found, peripheral, to, the, sedentary, neolithic, cultures, it, created, a, distinctive, type, of, pottery, with, point, or, knob, base, and, flared, rims, manufactured, by, methods, not, used, by, the, neolithic, farmers, though, each, area, of, mesolithic, ceramic, developed, an, individual, style, common, features, suggest, a, single, point, of, origin, the, earliest, manifestation, of, this, type, of, pottery, may, be, in, the, region, around, lake, baikal, in, siberia, it, appears, in, the, yelshanka, culture, on, the, volga, in, russia, 9, 000, years, ago, and, from, there, spread, via, the, dnieper, donets, culture, to, the, narva, culture, of, the, eastern, baltic, spreading, westward, along, the, coastline, it, is, found, in, the, erteb, lle, culture, of, denmark, and, ellerbek, of, northern, germany, and, the, related, swifterbant, culture, of, the, low, countries, a, 2012, publication, in, the, science, journal, announced, that, the, earliest, pottery, yet, known, anywhere, in, the, world, was, found, in, xianrendong, cave, in, china, dating, by, radiocarbon, to, between, 20, 000, and, 19, 000, years, before, present, at, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, the, carbon, 14, datation, was, established, by, carefully, dating, surrounding, sediments, many, of, the, pottery, fragments, had, scorch, marks, suggesting, that, the, pottery, was, used, for, cooking, these, early, pottery, containers, were, made, well, before, the, invention, of, agriculture, dated, to, 10, 000, to, 8, 000, bc, by, mobile, foragers, who, hunted, and, gathered, their, food, during, the, late, glacial, maximum, epipalaeolithic, near, east, caucasus, zagros, while, paleolithic, and, neolithic, have, been, found, useful, terms, and, concepts, in, the, archaeology, of, china, and, can, be, mostly, regarded, as, happily, naturalized, mesolithic, was, introduced, later, mostly, after, 1945, and, does, not, appear, to, be, a, necessary, or, useful, term, in, the, context, of, china, chinese, sites, that, have, been, regarded, as, mesolithic, are, better, considered, as, early, neolithic, in, the, archaeology, of, india, the, mesolithic, dated, roughly, between, 12, 000, and, 8, 000, bp, remains, a, concept, in, use, in, the, archaeology, of, the, americas, an, archaic, or, meso, indian, period, following, the, lithic, stage, somewhat, equates, to, the, mesolithic, the, saharan, rock, paintings, found, at, tassili, n, ajjer, in, central, sahara, and, at, other, locations, depict, vivid, scenes, of, everyday, life, in, central, north, africa, some, of, these, paintings, were, executed, by, a, hunting, people, who, lived, in, a, savanna, region, teeming, with, a, water, dependent, species, like, the, hippopotamus, animals, that, no, longer, exist, in, the, now, desert, area
