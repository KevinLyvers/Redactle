the, history, of, the, caribbean, reveals, the, region, s, significant, role, in, the, colonial, struggles, of, the, european, powers, since, the, 15th, century, in, the, modern, era, it, remains, strategically, and, economically, important, in, 1492, christopher, columbus, landed, in, the, caribbean, and, claimed, the, region, for, spain, the, following, year, the, first, spanish, settlements, were, established, in, the, caribbean, although, the, spanish, conquests, of, the, aztec, empire, and, the, inca, empire, in, the, early, sixteenth, century, made, mexico, and, peru, more, desirable, places, for, spanish, exploration, and, settlement, the, caribbean, remained, strategically, important, from, the, 1620s, and, 1630s, onwards, non, hispanic, privateers, traders, and, settlers, established, permanent, colonies, and, trading, posts, on, the, caribbean, islands, neglected, by, spain, such, colonies, spread, throughout, the, caribbean, from, the, bahamas, in, the, northwest, to, tobago, in, the, southeast, furthermore, during, this, period, french, and, english, buccaneers, settled, on, the, island, of, tortuga, the, northern, and, western, coasts, of, hispaniola, haiti, and, dominican, republic, and, later, in, jamaica, after, the, spanish, american, war, in, 1898, the, islands, of, cuba, and, puerto, rico, were, no, longer, part, of, the, spanish, empire, in, the, new, world, in, the, 20th, century, the, caribbean, was, again, important, during, world, war, ii, in, the, decolonization, wave, after, the, war, and, in, the, tension, between, communist, cuba, and, the, united, states, the, exploitation, of, the, labor, of, indigenous, peoples, and, the, demographic, collapse, of, that, population, forced, migration, of, enslaved, africans, immigration, of, europeans, chinese, south, asians, and, others, and, rivalry, amongst, world, powers, since, the, sixteenth, century, have, given, caribbean, history, an, impact, disproportionate, to, its, size, many, islands, have, attained, independence, from, colonial, powers, and, sovereignty, others, have, formal, political, ties, with, major, powers, including, the, united, states, the, early, economic, structure, integrating, the, caribbean, into, the, atlantic, world, and, world, economic, system, continues, to, impact, the, modern, caribbean, region, during, european, contact, in, 1492, caribbean, islands, were, densely, populated, by, different, indigenous, groups, recent, scholarly, research, has, investigated, the, origins, and, evolution, of, the, islands, populations, over, the, entire, period, at, the, beginning, of, the, current, geological, epoch, the, holocene, era, the, northern, part, of, south, america, was, occupied, by, groups, of, small, game, hunters, fishers, and, foragers, these, groups, occasionally, resided, in, semi, permanent, campsites, while, mostly, being, mobile, to, use, a, wide, range, of, plant, and, animal, resources, in, various, habitats, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, trinidad, was, the, first, caribbean, island, settled, as, early, as, 9000, 8000, bce, however, the, first, settlers, most, likely, arrived, in, trinidad, when, it, was, still, attached, to, south, america, by, land, bridges, it, was, not, until, about, 7000, 6000, bce, during, the, early, holocene, that, trinidad, became, an, island, rather, than, part, of, the, mainland, due, to, a, significant, jump, in, sea, level, by, about, 60, m, which, may, be, attributable, to, climate, change, the, conclusion, is, that, trinidad, was, the, only, caribbean, island, that, could, have, been, colonized, by, indigenous, people, from, the, south, american, mainland, by, not, traversing, hundreds, or, thousands, of, kilometers, of, the, open, sea, the, earliest, major, habitation, sites, discovered, in, trinidad, are, the, shell, midden, deposits, of, banwari, trace, and, st, john, which, have, been, dated, between, 6000, and, 5100, bce, both, shell, middens, represent, extended, deposits, of, shells, discarded, by, human, populations, utilizing, the, crustaceans, as, a, food, source, and, stone, and, bone, tools, they, are, considered, to, belong, to, the, ortoiroid, archaeological, tradition, named, after, the, similar, but, much, more, recent, ortoire, site, in, mayaro, trinidad, scholars, have, attempted, to, classify, caribbean, prehistory, into, different, ages, a, difficult, and, controversial, task, in, the, 1970s, archaeologist, irving, rouse, defined, three, ages, to, classify, caribbean, prehistory, the, lithic, archaic, and, ceramic, age, based, on, archaeological, evidence, current, literature, on, caribbean, prehistory, still, uses, these, three, terms, but, there, is, much, dispute, regarding, their, usefulness, and, definition, in, general, the, lithic, age, is, considered, the, first, era, of, human, development, in, the, americas, and, the, period, where, stone, chipping, was, first, practiced, the, ensuing, archaic, age, is, often, defined, by, specialized, subsistence, adaptions, combining, hunting, fishing, collecting, and, the, managing, of, wild, food, plants, ceramic, age, communities, manufactured, ceramic, and, made, use, of, small, scale, agriculture, except, for, trinidad, the, first, caribbean, islands, were, settled, during, the, archaic, age, between, 3500, and, 3000, bce, archaeological, sites, of, this, period, have, been, located, in, barbados, cuba, cura, ao, and, st, martin, followed, closely, by, hispaniola, and, puerto, rico, this, settlement, phase, is, often, attributed, to, the, ortoiroid, culture, between, 800, and, 200, bce, a, new, migratory, group, expanded, through, the, caribbean, island, the, saladoid, this, group, is, named, after, the, saladero, site, in, venezuela, where, their, distinctive, pottery, typically, distinguished, by, white, on, red, painted, designs, was, first, identified, the, introduction, of, pottery, and, plant, domestication, to, the, caribbean, is, often, attributed, to, saladoid, groups, and, is, considered, the, beginning, of, the, ceramic, age, however, recent, studies, have, revealed, that, crops, and, pottery, were, already, present, in, some, archaic, caribbean, populations, before, the, arrival, of, the, saladoid, although, a, large, number, of, caribbean, islands, were, settled, during, the, archaic, and, ceramic, ages, some, islands, were, presumably, visited, much, later, jamaica, has, no, known, settlements, until, around, 600, ce, while, the, cayman, islands, show, no, evidence, of, settlement, before, european, arrival, following, the, colonization, of, trinidad, it, was, originally, proposed, that, saladoid, groups, island, hopped, their, way, to, puerto, rico, but, current, research, tends, to, move, away, from, this, stepping, stone, model, in, favor, of, the, southward, route, hypothesis, the, southward, route, hypothesis, proposes, that, the, northern, antilles, were, settled, directly, from, south, america, followed, by, progressively, southward, movements, into, the, lesser, antilles, this, hypothesis, has, been, supported, by, both, radiocarbon, dates, and, seafaring, simulations, one, initial, impetus, of, movement, from, the, mainland, to, the, northern, antilles, may, have, been, the, search, for, high, quality, materials, such, as, flint, flinty, bay, on, antigua, is, one, of, the, best, known, sources, of, high, quality, flint, in, the, lesser, antilles, the, presence, of, flint, from, antigua, on, many, other, caribbean, islands, highlights, the, importance, of, this, material, during, the, pre, contact, period, the, period, from, 650, to, 800, ce, saw, major, cultural, socio, political, and, ritual, reformulations, which, took, place, both, on, the, mainland, and, in, many, caribbean, islands, the, saladoid, interaction, sphere, disintegrated, rapidly, this, period, is, characterized, with, a, change, in, climate, centuries, of, abundant, rainfall, were, replaced, by, prolonged, droughts, and, increased, frequency, of, hurricanes, in, general, the, caribbean, population, increased, with, communities, changing, from, scattered, single, villages, to, the, creation, of, settlement, clusters, agricultural, activity, increased, analysis, of, cultural, material, has, also, shown, the, development, of, tighter, networks, between, islands, during, the, post, saladoid, period, the, period, after, 800, ce, can, be, seen, as, a, period, of, transition, in, which, status, differentiation, and, hierarchically, ranked, society, evolved, identified, by, a, shift, from, achieved, to, ascribed, leadership, after, about, 1200, ce, this, process, was, interrupted, by, the, absorption, of, many, caribbean, settlements, into, the, evolving, socio, political, structure, of, the, greater, antillean, society, this, process, disrupted, more, or, less, independent, lines, of, development, of, local, communities, and, marked, the, beginnings, of, sociopolitical, changes, on, a, much, larger, scale, at, the, time, of, the, european, arrival, three, major, groups, of, indigenous, peoples, lived, on, the, islands, the, ta, no, sometimes, also, referred, to, as, arawak, in, the, greater, antilles, the, bahamas, and, the, leeward, islands, the, kalinago, and, galibi, in, the, windward, islands, and, the, ciboney, in, western, cuba, scholars, have, divided, ta, nos, into, classic, ta, nos, who, occupied, hispaniola, and, puerto, rico, western, ta, nos, who, occupied, cuba, jamaica, and, the, bahamian, archipelago, and, the, eastern, ta, nos, who, occupied, the, leeward, islands, trinidad, was, inhabited, by, both, carib, speaking, and, arawak, speaking, groups, dna, studies, changed, some, of, the, traditional, understandings, of, pre, contact, indigenous, history, in, 2003, a, geneticist, from, the, university, of, puerto, rico, at, mayag, ez, juan, mart, nez, cruzado, designed, an, island, wide, dna, survey, of, puerto, rico, s, modern, population, the, received, understanding, of, the, profile, of, puerto, ricans, ancestry, has, been, as, mainly, having, spanish, ethnic, origins, with, some, african, ancestry, and, distant, and, less, significant, indigenous, ancestry, mart, nez, cruzado, s, research, revealed, that, 61, of, all, puerto, ricans, have, amerindian, mitochondrial, dna, 27, have, african, and, 12, caucasian, according, to, national, geographic, among, the, surprising, findings, is, that, most, of, the, caribbean, s, original, inhabitants, may, have, been, wiped, out, by, south, american, newcomers, a, thousand, years, before, the, spanish, invasion, that, began, in, 1492, moreover, indigenous, populations, of, islands, like, puerto, rico, and, hispaniola, were, likely, far, smaller, at, the, time, of, the, spanish, arrival, than, previously, thought, soon, after, the, voyages, of, christopher, columbus, to, the, americas, both, portuguese, and, spanish, ships, began, claiming, territories, in, central, and, south, america, these, colonies, brought, in, gold, and, other, european, powers, most, specifically, the, english, dutch, and, french, hoped, to, establish, profitable, colonies, of, their, own, imperial, rivalries, made, the, caribbean, a, contested, area, during, european, wars, for, centuries, in, the, spanish, american, wars, of, independence, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, most, of, spanish, america, broke, away, from, the, spanish, empire, but, cuba, and, puerto, rico, remained, under, the, spanish, crown, until, the, spanish, american, war, of, 1898, the, spanish, encounter, with, lands, and, peoples, unknown, to, them, before, the, 1492, began, with, the, first, voyage, of, genoese, mariner, christopher, columbus, sailing, under, license, from, queen, isabel, i, of, castile, permanent, spanish, settlement, began, in, 1493, the, first, quarter, century, of, spanish, settlement, in, the, caribbean, set, enduring, patterns, that, were, to, be, replicated, throughout, the, americas, after, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, and, the, subsequent, conquest, of, peru, with, their, dense, indigenous, populations, organized, in, high, civilizations, and, the, discovery, of, rich, deposits, of, precious, metals, the, caribbean, ceased, to, be, the, primary, focus, of, the, spanish, empire, in, the, americas, but, the, administrative, social, and, cultural, patterns, the, spanish, set, in, the, caribbean, were, enduring, spanish, contact, and, exploitation, of, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, caribbean, had, devastating, consequences, for, the, natives, natives, deaths, through, disease, and, overwork, prompted, in, spanish, settlers, search, for, indigenous, labor, on, other, caribbean, islands, resulting, in, the, enslavement, of, natives, and, their, transportation, to, the, islands, of, spanish, settlement, most, saliently, the, crown, considered, the, indigenous, population, their, new, vassals, and, the, crown, attempted, to, stem, the, precipitous, loss, of, indigenous, population, and, settlers, enslavement, and, maltreatment, of, the, indigenous, population, by, enacting, laws, to, curb, settlers, exploitative, activities, during, columbus, s, first, voyage, of, exploration, in, 1492, he, made, contact, with, the, lucayans, whom, he, called, indians, indios, in, the, bahamas, and, the, ta, no, in, cuba, and, the, northern, coast, of, hispaniola, starting, with, his, second, voyage, in, 1493, spaniards, came, to, settle, permanently, in, the, region, dubbed, the, indies, spaniards, saw, evidence, of, gold, deposits, when, seeing, natives, gold, personal, ornaments, enticing, the, spanish, search, for, wealth, although, spain, claimed, the, entire, caribbean, and, concluded, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, 1494, with, portugal, that, divided, the, world, between, the, two, monarchies, spaniards, settled, only, the, larger, islands, of, hispaniola, now, the, dominican, republic, and, haiti, 1493, where, they, founded, the, permanent, settlement, of, santo, domingo, the, spanish, later, founded, settlements, on, puerto, rico, 1508, jamaica, 1509, cuba, 1511, and, trinidad, 1530, and, the, small, pearl, islands, of, cubagua, and, margarita, off, the, venezuelan, coast, because, of, their, valuable, pearl, beds, which, were, worked, extensively, between, 1508, and, 1530, the, spanish, settled, permanently, in, the, caribbean, establishing, as, far, as, possible, lives, similar, or, better, than, what, they, had, in, iberia, unlike, the, portuguese, pattern, of, expansion, that, created, a, series, of, small, trading, posts, or, forts, spaniards, expectation, was, to, create, spanish, style, cities, with, permanent, residents, they, expected, to, use, forced, labor, of, the, indigenous, population, to, make, european, settlement, not, only, possible, but, also, profitable, spaniards, required, the, natives, produce, food, for, european, settlers, putting, strain, on, agriculture, that, did, not, generally, produce, major, surpluses, spaniards, took, it, as, their, right, to, force, the, indigenous, to, labor, for, them, in, enterprises, often, far, from, natives, home, villages, the, allocation, of, labor, to, individual, spanish, settlers, was, via, grants, called, encomiendas, the, holders, of, these, grants, encomenderos, set, indigenous, to, search, for, deposits, of, gold, and, mine, it, the, most, famous, account, of, the, abuses, and, exploitation, was, by, dominican, friar, bartolom, de, las, casas, who, influenced, the, spanish, crown, to, create, laws, to, end, the, abuses, and, to, attempt, to, stem, the, precipitous, plunge, of, the, indigenous, populations, to, supplement, and, then, replace, the, dwindling, indigenous, labor, force, the, spanish, transported, enslaved, africans, to, the, caribbean, to, work, on, plantations, cultivating, cane, sugar, a, high, value, export, product, spaniards, continued, their, explorations, of, islands, and, the, lands, around, the, caribbean, sea, in, search, of, sources, of, dense, indigenous, populations, and, material, wealth, the, expedition, of, spanish, settler, on, cuba, hern, n, cort, s, resulted, in, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, in, 1521, which, shifted, the, crown, s, focus, to, mexico, although, the, caribbean, remained, strategically, important, for, the, spanish, empire, other, european, powers, established, a, presence, in, the, caribbean, after, spain, s, main, interest, turned, toward, mexico, and, peru, where, there, were, dense, indigenous, populations, that, could, be, forced, to, labor, and, where, there, were, rich, deposits, of, silver, the, dutch, the, french, and, the, english, conquered, islands, claimed, by, spain, but, not, effectively, controlled, for, european, powers, without, colonies, in, the, americas, the, islands, presented, possibilities, for, commercial, development, of, sugar, plantations, on, the, model, established, by, the, spanish, using, enslaved, african, laborers, also, important, was, that, the, islands, could, serve, as, bases, for, trade, and, piracy, in, the, region, piracy, in, the, caribbean, was, widespread, during, the, colonial, era, especially, between, 1640, and, 1680, the, term, buccaneer, is, often, used, to, describe, a, pirate, operating, in, this, region, during, the, first, three, quarters, of, the, sixteenth, century, matters, of, balance, of, power, and, dynastic, succession, weighed, heavily, on, the, course, of, european, diplomacy, and, war, europe, s, largest, and, most, powerful, kingdoms, france, and, spain, were, the, continent, s, fierce, rivals, tensions, increased, after, 1516, when, the, kingdoms, of, castile, le, n, and, aragon, were, ruled, by, charles, v, as, his, inheritance, from, his, maternal, grandparents, isabel, i, of, castile, and, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, and, his, mother, queen, joan, three, years, later, expanded, charles, domains, after, his, election, as, holy, roman, emperor, and, the, territories, he, held, as, his, personal, empire, surrounded, france, in, 1521, france, went, to, war, with, the, holy, roman, empire, spanish, troops, routed, french, armies, in, france, the, italian, peninsula, and, elsewhere, forcing, the, french, crown, to, surrender, in, 1526, and, again, in, 1529, the, italian, wars, as, the, french, spanish, wars, came, to, be, known, reignited, in, 1536, and, again, in, 1542, intermittent, warring, between, the, valois, monarchy, and, the, habsburg, empire, continued, until, 1559, when, charles, abdicated, and, retired, to, a, monastery, after, dividing, his, realms, french, corsair, attacks, began, in, the, early, 1520s, as, soon, as, france, declared, war, on, spain, in, 1521, the, year, hern, n, cort, s, defeated, the, aztecs, prodigious, treasures, from, mexico, began, to, cross, the, atlantic, en, route, to, spain, french, monarch, francis, i, challenged, spain, s, exclusivist, claims, to, the, new, world, and, its, wealth, demanding, to, see, the, clause, in, adam, s, will, which, excluded, me, from, my, share, when, the, world, was, being, divided, giovanni, da, verrazzano, aka, jean, florin, led, the, first, recorded, french, corsair, attack, against, spanish, vessels, carrying, treasures, from, the, new, world, in, 1523, off, the, cape, of, st, vincent, portugal, his, vessels, captured, two, spanish, ships, laden, with, a, fabulous, treasure, consisting, of, 70, 000, ducats, worth, of, gold, large, quantities, of, silver, and, pearls, and, 25, 000, pounds, of, sugar, a, much, treasured, commodity, at, the, time, the, first, recorded, incursion, in, the, caribbean, happened, in, 1528, when, a, lone, french, corsair, vessel, appeared, off, the, coast, of, santo, domingo, and, its, crew, sacked, the, village, of, san, germ, n, on, the, western, coast, of, puerto, rico, in, the, mid, 1530s, corsairs, some, catholic, but, most, of, them, protestant, huguenot, began, routinely, attacking, spanish, vessels, and, raiding, caribbean, ports, and, coastal, towns, the, most, coveted, were, santo, domingo, havana, santiago, and, san, germ, n, corsair, port, raids, in, cuba, and, elsewhere, in, the, region, usually, followed, the, rescate, ransom, model, whereby, the, aggressors, seized, villages, and, cities, kidnapped, local, residents, and, demanded, payment, for, their, release, if, there, were, no, hostages, corsairs, demanded, ransoms, in, exchange, for, sparing, towns, from, destruction, whether, ransoms, were, paid, or, not, corsairs, looted, and, frequently, committed, acts, of, violence, against, their, victims, desecrated, churches, and, holy, images, and, left, smoldering, reminders, of, their, incursions, in, 1536, france, and, spain, went, to, war, again, and, french, corsairs, launched, a, series, of, attacks, on, spanish, caribbean, settlements, and, ships, the, next, year, a, corsair, vessel, appeared, in, havana, and, demanded, a, 700, ducat, rescate, spanish, men, of, war, arrived, soon, and, scared, off, the, intruding, vessel, which, returned, soon, thereafter, to, demand, yet, another, rescate, santiago, was, also, victim, of, an, attack, that, year, and, both, cities, endured, raids, yet, again, in, 1538, the, waters, off, cuba, s, northwest, became, particularly, attractive, to, pirates, as, commercial, vessels, returning, to, spain, had, to, squeeze, through, the, 90, mile, long, strait, between, key, west, and, havana, in, 1537, 1538, corsairs, captured, and, sacked, nine, spanish, vessels, while, france, and, spain, were, at, peace, until, 1542, beyond, the, line, corsair, activity, continued, when, war, erupted, again, it, echoed, once, more, in, the, caribbean, a, particularly, vicious, french, corsair, attack, took, place, in, havana, in, 1543, it, left, a, gory, toll, of, 200, killed, spanish, settlers, in, all, between, 1535, and, 1563, french, corsairs, carried, out, around, sixty, attacks, against, spanish, settlements, and, captured, over, seventeen, spanish, vessels, in, the, region, 1536, 1547, while, the, french, and, spanish, fought, one, another, in, europe, and, the, caribbean, england, sided, with, spain, largely, because, of, dynastic, alliances, spain, s, relations, with, england, soured, upon, the, crowning, of, the, protestant, elizabeth, i, in, 1558, she, openly, supported, the, dutch, insurrection, in, the, spanish, netherlands, and, aided, huguenot, forces, in, france, after, decades, of, increasing, tensions, and, confrontations, in, the, northern, atlantic, and, the, caribbean, anglo, spanish, hostilities, broke, out, in, 1585, when, the, english, crown, dispatched, over, 7, 000, troops, to, the, netherlands, and, queen, elizabeth, liberally, granted, licenses, for, privateers, to, carry, out, piracy, against, spain, s, caribbean, possessions, and, vessels, tensions, further, intensified, in, 1587, when, elizabeth, i, ordered, the, execution, of, catholic, mary, queen, of, scots, after, twenty, years, of, captivity, and, gave, the, order, for, a, preemptive, attack, against, the, spanish, armada, stationed, in, cadiz, in, retaliation, spain, organized, the, famous, naval, attack, that, ended, tragically, for, spain, with, the, destruction, of, the, invincible, armada, in, 1588, spain, rebuilt, its, naval, forces, largely, with, galleons, built, in, havana, and, continued, to, fight, england, until, elizabeth, s, death, in, 1603, spain, however, had, received, a, near, fatal, blow, that, ended, its, standing, as, europe, s, most, powerful, nation, and, virtually, undisputed, master, of, the, indies, following, the, franco, spanish, peace, treaty, of, 1559, crown, sanctioned, french, corsair, activities, subsided, but, huguenot, pirate, incursions, persisted, in, at, least, one, this, instance, led, to, the, formation, of, a, temporary, huguenot, settlement, in, the, isle, of, pines, off, cuba, english, piracy, increased, during, the, reign, of, charles, i, king, of, england, scotland, and, ireland, 1625, 1649, and, became, more, aggressive, as, anglo, spanish, relations, further, deteriorated, during, the, thirty, years, war, although, spain, had, been, dealing, with, the, insurrection, of, netherlands, against, the, habsburg, monarchy, since, the, 1560s, the, dutch, were, latecomers, to, the, caribbean, they, appeared, in, the, region, only, after, the, mid, 1590s, when, the, dutch, republic, was, no, longer, on, the, defensive, in, its, long, conflict, against, spain, dutch, privateering, became, more, widespread, and, violent, beginning, in, the, 1620s, english, incursions, in, the, spanish, claimed, caribbean, boomed, during, queen, elizabeth, s, rule, these, actions, originally, took, the, guise, of, well, organized, large, scale, smuggling, expeditions, headed, by, piratical, smugglers, the, likes, of, john, hawkins, john, oxenham, and, francis, drake, one, of, their, main, objectives, were, smuggling, african, slaves, into, spain, s, caribbean, possessions, in, exchange, for, tropical, products, the, first, instances, of, english, mercantile, piracy, took, place, in, 1562, 63, when, hawkins, men, raided, a, portuguese, vessel, off, the, coast, of, sierra, leone, captured, the, 300, slaves, on, board, and, smuggled, them, into, santo, domingo, in, exchange, for, sugar, hides, and, precious, woods, hawkins, and, his, contemporaries, pioneered, the, method, of, maximizing, the, number, of, slaves, that, could, fit, into, a, ship, he, and, other, slave, traders, methodically, packed, enslaved, africans, by, forcing, them, to, lie, on, their, sides, spooned, against, one, another, an, example, is, hawkins, s, slave, trading, vessel, jesus, of, l, beck, a, ship, he, used, on, slave, smuggling, expeditions, on, which, he, transported, hundreds, of, enslaved, africans, in, 1567, and, 1568, hawkins, commanded, two, piratical, smuggling, expeditions, the, last, of, which, ended, disastrously, he, lost, almost, all, of, his, ships, and, three, fourths, of, his, men, were, killed, by, spanish, soldiers, at, san, juan, de, ul, a, off, the, coast, of, veracruz, the, point, of, departure, of, the, fleet, of, new, spain, hawkins, and, drake, barely, escaped, but, oxenham, was, captured, convicted, of, heresy, of, protestantism, by, the, mexican, inquisition, and, burned, alive, many, of, the, battles, of, the, anglo, spanish, war, were, fought, in, the, caribbean, not, by, regular, english, forces, but, rather, by, privateers, whom, queen, elizabeth, had, licensed, to, carry, out, attacks, on, spanish, vessels, and, ports, these, were, former, pirates, who, now, held, a, more, venerable, status, as, privateers, during, those, years, over, seventy, five, documented, english, privateering, expeditions, targeted, spanish, possessions, and, vessels, drake, terrorized, spanish, vessels, and, ports, early, in, 1586, his, forces, seized, santo, domingo, retaining, control, over, it, for, around, a, month, before, departing, they, plundered, and, destroyed, the, city, taking, a, huge, bounty, drake, s, men, destroyed, images, and, ornaments, in, catholic, churches, the, development, of, agriculture, in, the, caribbean, required, a, large, workforce, of, manual, laborers, which, the, europeans, created, by, the, forced, migration, of, enslaved, africans, to, the, americas, the, concomitant, atlantic, slave, trade, brought, enslaved, africans, to, spanish, portuguese, dutch, english, and, french, colonies, in, the, americas, enslaved, africans, were, brought, to, the, caribbean, from, the, early, 16th, century, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, with, majority, brought, between, 1701, and, 1810, the, following, table, lists, the, number, of, slaves, brought, into, some, of, the, caribbean, colonies, abolitionists, in, the, americas, and, in, europe, became, vocal, opponents, of, the, slave, trade, throughout, the, 19th, century, the, importation, of, slaves, to, the, colonies, was, often, outlawed, years, before, the, end, of, the, institution, of, slavery, itself, it, was, well, into, the, 19th, century, before, many, slaves, in, the, caribbean, were, legally, free, the, trade, in, slaves, was, abolished, in, the, british, empire, through, the, abolition, of, the, slave, trade, act, in, 1807, slaves, in, the, british, empire, continued, to, remain, enslaved, however, until, the, parliament, of, the, united, kingdom, passed, the, slavery, abolition, act, in, 1833, when, the, slavery, abolition, act, came, into, force, in, 1834, roughly, 700, 000, slaves, in, the, british, west, indies, immediately, became, free, other, enslaved, workers, were, freed, several, years, later, after, a, period, of, apprenticeship, which, lasted, several, years, slavery, was, abolished, in, the, dutch, empire, in, 1814, spain, abolished, slavery, in, its, empire, in, 1811, with, the, exceptions, of, cuba, puerto, rico, and, santo, domingo, spain, ended, the, slave, trade, to, these, colonies, in, 1817, after, being, paid, 400, 000, by, britain, slavery, itself, was, not, abolished, in, cuba, until, 1886, france, abolished, slavery, in, its, colonies, in, 1848, the, official, plantocratic, view, of, slave, marriage, sought, to, deny, the, slaves, any, loving, bonds, or, long, standing, relationships, thus, conveniently, rationalising, the, indiscriminate, separation, of, close, kin, through, sales, from, the, earliest, days, of, slavery, indiscriminate, sales, and, separation, severely, disrupted, the, domestic, life, of, individual, slaves, slaves, could, be, sold, so, that, spouses, could, be, sold, separately, slave, couples, were, sometimes, separated, by, sale, they, lived, as, single, slaves, or, as, part, of, maternal, or, extended, families, but, considered, themselves, married, sale, of, estates, with, stock, to, pay, debts, more, common, in, the, late, period, of, slavery, was, criticised, as, separating, slave, spouses, william, beckford, argued, for, families, to, be, sold, together, or, kept, as, near, as, possible, in, the, same, neighbourhood, and, laws, were, passed, in, the, late, period, of, slavery, to, prevent, the, breakup, of, slave, families, by, sale, these, laws, were, frequently, ignored, slaves, frequently, reacted, strongly, to, enforced, severance, of, their, emotional, bonds, feeling, sorrow, and, despair, sometimes, according, to, thomas, cooper, in, 1820, resulting, in, death, from, distress, john, stewart, argued, against, separation, as, leading, slave, buyers, to, regret, it, because, of, despair, utter, despondency, or, put, period, to, their, lives, separated, slaves, often, used, free, time, to, travel, long, distances, to, reunite, for, a, night, and, sometimes, runaway, slaves, were, married, couples, however, sale, of, slaves, and, the, resulting, breakup, of, families, decreased, as, slave, plantations, lost, prosperity, european, plantations, required, laws, to, regulate, the, plantation, system, and, the, many, slaves, imported, to, work, on, the, plantations, this, legal, control, was, the, most, oppressive, for, slaves, inhabiting, colonies, where, they, outnumbered, their, european, masters, and, where, rebellion, was, persistent, such, as, jamaica, during, the, early, colonial, period, rebellious, slaves, were, harshly, punished, with, sentences, including, death, by, torture, less, serious, crimes, such, as, assault, theft, or, persistent, escape, attempts, were, commonly, punished, with, mutilations, such, as, the, cutting, off, of, a, hand, or, a, foot, in, european, colonies, in, the, caribbean, each, colony, had, to, develop, laws, regulating, slavery, british, west, indian, colonies, were, able, to, establish, laws, regulating, the, institution, through, their, own, local, legislatures, and, the, assent, of, the, colony, s, governor, who, served, as, a, representative, of, the, crown, in, contrast, french, danish, dutch, and, spanish, colonies, were, strictly, controlled, by, their, metropole, including, the, implementation, of, slave, codes, the, french, regulated, slaves, under, the, code, noir, black, code, which, was, in, force, in, all, of, france, s, colonies, and, was, based, upon, early, french, slave, practises, in, the, caribbean, colonies, as, noted, by, american, historian, jan, rogozinski, all, islands, sought, to, protect, the, planter, and, not, the, slave, slave, codes, in, the, british, west, indies, frequently, did, not, recognize, marriage, for, slaves, family, rights, education, for, slaves, or, the, right, to, religious, practices, such, as, holidays, the, code, noir, recognized, slave, marriages, but, only, with, the, consent, of, the, master, and, like, spanish, colonial, law, gave, legal, recognition, to, marriages, between, european, men, and, black, or, creole, women, they, were, also, more, generous, than, their, british, counterparts, in, granting, the, possibility, of, manumission, to, slaves, the, plantation, system, and, the, slave, trade, that, enabled, its, growth, led, to, regular, slave, resistance, in, many, caribbean, islands, throughout, the, colonial, era, resistance, was, made, by, escaping, from, the, plantations, altogether, and, seeking, refuge, in, the, areas, free, of, european, settlement, communities, of, escaped, slaves, who, were, known, as, maroons, banded, together, in, heavily, forested, and, mountainous, areas, of, the, greater, antilles, and, some, of, the, islands, of, the, lesser, antilles, the, spread, of, the, plantations, and, european, settlement, often, meant, the, end, of, many, maroon, communities, although, they, survived, on, saint, vincent, and, dominica, and, in, the, more, remote, mountainous, areas, of, jamaica, hispaniola, guadeloupe, and, cuba, violent, resistance, broke, out, periodically, on, the, larger, caribbean, islands, many, more, conspiracies, intended, to, create, rebellions, were, discovered, and, ended, by, europeans, before, they, could, materialise, actual, violent, uprisings, involving, anywhere, from, dozens, to, thousands, of, slaves, were, regular, events, however, jamaica, and, cuba, in, particular, had, many, slave, uprisings, such, uprisings, were, brutally, crushed, by, european, forces, the, following, table, lists, slave, rebellions, that, resulted, in, actual, violent, uprisings, the, extraction, of, wealth, from, the, caribbean, dates, back, to, the, spanish, colonists, starting, in, the, 1490s, who, forced, indigenous, peoples, held, by, spanish, settlers, in, encomienda, to, mine, for, gold, gold, was, not, the, long, term, motor, of, the, caribbean, economy, but, rather, the, cultivation, of, cane, sugar, christopher, columbus, observed, that, the, islands, were, favorable, for, the, cultivation, of, cane, sugar, a, high, value, export, commodity, 114, the, history, of, export, caribbean, agriculture, is, directly, linked, with, european, colonialism, spaniards, replicated, of, the, model, of, plantation, sugar, cultivation, in, the, atlantic, islands, using, forced, labor, sugar, was, a, luxury, in, europe, prior, to, the, 18th, century, with, increased, production, and, falling, prices, it, became, widely, popular, in, the, 18th, century, becoming, a, necessity, in, europe, the, 19th, century, this, evolution, of, taste, and, demand, for, sugar, as, an, essential, food, ingredient, unleashed, major, economic, and, social, changes, caribbean, islands, with, plentiful, sunshine, abundant, rainfalls, and, no, extended, frosts, were, well, suited, for, sugarcane, agriculture, and, sugar, factories, with, the, precipitous, decline, in, the, indigenous, population, during, the, first, years, of, spanish, colonization, the, problem, was, the, lack, of, labor, spaniards, sought, a, large, and, resilient, labor, force, for, cultivation, of, sugar, initiating, the, large, scale, forced, migration, of, enslaved, africans, the, success, of, spanish, caribbean, sugar, plantations, was, a, model, for, other, european, powers, the, portuguese, colony, of, brazil, also, developed, large, scale, sugar, plantations, the, high, demand, in, europe, for, sugar, attracted, other, european, powers, to, stake, claims, on, caribbean, islands, claimed, by, the, spanish, but, not, effectively, held, in, the, seventeenth, century, the, dutch, the, english, and, the, french, took, caribbean, islands, and, developed, plantation, agriculture, by, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, sugar, was, britain, s, largest, import, which, made, the, caribbean, islands, that, much, more, important, as, colonies, 3, the, islands, also, became, bases, for, european, commerce, that, circumvented, spanish, restrictions, on, the, trade, monopoly, that, the, spanish, crown, sought, to, impose, on, its, overseas, possessions, following, the, abolition, of, slavery, during, the, 19th, century, across, the, atlantic, world, many, emancipated, africans, left, their, former, masters, this, created, an, economic, chaos, for, the, owners, of, caribbean, sugar, cane, plantations, the, hard, work, in, hot, humid, farms, required, a, labor, force, of, strong, low, waged, men, the, plantation, owners, looked, for, cheap, labor, this, they, found, initially, in, china, and, then, in, india, the, plantation, owners, subsequently, crafted, a, new, legal, system, of, forced, labor, which, in, many, ways, resembled, enslavement, they, were, indentured, laborers, technically, not, enslaved, labor, but, the, labor, regime, was, harsh, migrants, from, the, indian, subcontinent, began, to, replace, africans, previously, brought, as, slaves, under, this, indentured, labor, scheme, to, serve, on, sugarcane, plantations, in, european, colonies, in, the, americas, and, parts, of, south, america, the, first, ships, carrying, indentured, laborers, for, sugarcane, plantations, left, india, in, 1836, over, the, next, 70, years, numerous, more, ships, brought, indentured, laborers, to, the, caribbean, as, cheap, labor, for, harsh, work, the, enslaved, labor, and, indentured, laborers, both, in, millions, of, people, were, brought, to, the, caribbean, as, in, other, european, colonies, throughout, the, world, export, agriculture, dominated, the, island, economies, with, few, cities, and, no, industrial, base, agricultural, workers, had, no, alternative, for, urban, nonfarming, employment, 27, agricultural, laborers, wages, were, extremely, low, with, no, potential, for, growth, since, producers, sought, to, keep, labor, costs, low, and, their, own, profits, high, 28, profits, from, caribbean, agriculture, were, not, converted, to, industrial, development, or, for, the, changes, in, agricultural, workers, conditions, as, industrialized, nations, sought, cheap, sources, of, food, for, their, industrial, working, classes, caribbean, islands, continued, to, be, the, producers, of, cane, sugar, cane, sugar, was, no, longer, a, high, value, commodity, only, for, elites, caribbean, sugar, was, cheap, enough, for, the, industrial, working, classes, to, consider, it, a, staple, in, their, diet, it, would, prove, extremely, difficult, for, caribbean, producers, to, escape, from, the, economic, relationship, with, the, developed, world, that, was, forged, during, the, colonial, era, caribbean, nations, were, among, the, world, s, most, impoverished, the, caribbean, region, was, affected, by, violence, and, war, throughout, much, of, colonial, history, but, the, wars, were, often, based, in, europe, with, only, minor, battles, fought, in, the, caribbean, piracy, in, the, caribbean, was, often, a, tool, used, by, the, european, empires, to, wage, war, unofficially, against, one, another, gold, plundered, from, spanish, ships, and, brought, to, other, european, nations, had, a, pivotal, effect, on, european, interest, in, colonising, the, region, haiti, the, former, french, colony, of, saint, domingue, on, hispaniola, was, the, first, caribbean, nation, to, gain, independence, from, european, powers, in, 1804, this, followed, 13, years, of, war, that, started, as, a, slave, uprising, in, 1791, and, quickly, turned, into, the, haitian, revolution, under, the, leadership, of, toussaint, louverture, black, haitian, revolutionaries, overthrew, the, french, colonial, government, before, becoming, the, world, s, first, and, oldest, black, republic, and, also, the, second, oldest, republic, in, the, western, hemisphere, after, the, united, states, this, is, additionally, notable, as, being, the, only, successful, slave, uprising, in, history, the, remaining, two, thirds, of, hispaniola, santo, domingo, was, declared, independent, from, spain, in, 1821, a, year, later, in, 1822, the, nation, was, conquered, by, haitian, forces, in, 1844, the, newly, formed, dominican, republic, declared, its, independence, from, haiti, after, a, brief, return, to, spanish, rule, the, dominican, republic, gained, its, third, and, final, independence, in, 1865, the, nations, bordering, the, caribbean, in, central, america, gained, independence, with, mexican, independence, from, spain, in, 1821, and, the, establishment, of, the, first, mexican, empire,

influence, of, the, united, states, stretches, beyond, a, military, context, in, economic, terms, the, united, states, represents, a, primary, market, for, the, export, of, caribbean, goods, notably, this, is, a, recent, historical, trend, the, post, war, era, reflects, a, time, of, transition, for, the, caribbean, basin, when, as, colonial, powers, sought, to, disentangle, from, the, region, as, part, of, a, larger, trend, of, decolonisation, the, us, began, to, expand, its, hegemony, throughout, the, region, this, pattern, is, confirmed, by, economic, initiatives, such, as, the, caribbean, basin, initiative, cbi, which, sought, to, congeal, alliances, with, the, region, in, light, of, a, perceived, soviet, threat, the, cbi, marks, the, emergence, of, the, caribbean, basin, as, a, geopolitical, area, of, strategic, interest, to, the, us, this, relationship, has, carried, through, to, the, 21st, century, as, reflected, by, the, caribbean, basin, trade, partnership, act, the, caribbean, basin, is, also, of, strategic, interest, in, regards, to, trade, routes, it, has, been, estimated, that, nearly, half, of, us, foreign, cargo, and, crude, oil, imports, are, brought, via, caribbean, seaways, during, wartime, these, figures, only, stand, to, increase, the, united, states, is, also, of, strategic, interest, to, the, caribbean, caribbean, foreign, policy, seeks, to, strengthen, its, participation, in, a, global, free, market, economy, as, an, extension, of, this, caribbean, states, do, not, wish, to, be, excluded, from, their, primary, market, in, the, united, states, or, be, bypassed, in, the, creation, of, wider, hemispheric, trading, blocs, that, stand, to, drastically, alter, trade, and, production, in, the, caribbean, basin, as, such, the, us, has, played, an, influential, role, in, shaping, the, caribbean, s, role, in, this, hemispheric, market, likewise, building, trade, relationships, with, the, us, has, always, figured, in, strongly, with, the, political, goal, of, economic, security, in, post, independence, caribbean, states, the, mainstay, of, the, caribbean, economy, sugar, has, declined, gradually, since, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, although, it, is, still, a, major, crop, in, the, region, caribbean, sugar, production, became, relatively, expensive, in, comparison, to, other, parts, of, the, world, that, developed, their, own, sugar, cultivation, industries, making, it, difficult, for, caribbean, sugar, products, to, compete, caribbean, economic, diversification, into, new, activities, became, essential, to, the, islands, by, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, caribbean, islands, enjoyed, greater, political, stability, large, scale, violence, was, no, longer, a, threat, after, the, end, of, slavery, in, the, islands, the, british, controlled, islands, in, particular, benefited, from, investments, in, the, infrastructure, of, colonies, by, the, beginning, of, world, war, i, all, british, controlled, islands, had, their, own, police, force, fire, department, doctors, and, at, least, one, hospital, sewage, systems, and, public, water, supplies, were, built, and, death, rates, in, the, islands, dropped, sharply, literacy, also, increased, significantly, during, this, period, as, schools, were, set, up, for, students, descended, from, african, slaves, public, libraries, were, established, in, large, towns, and, capital, cities, these, improvements, in, the, quality, of, life, for, the, inhabitants, also, made, the, islands, a, much, more, attractive, destination, for, visitors, tourists, began, to, visit, the, caribbean, in, larger, numbers, by, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, although, there, was, a, tourist, presence, in, the, region, as, early, as, the, 1880s, the, u, s, owned, united, fruit, company, operated, a, fleet, of, banana, boats, in, the, region, that, doubled, as, tourist, transportation, the, united, fruit, company, also, developed, hotels, for, tourist, accommodations, it, soon, became, apparent, however, that, this, industry, was, much, like, a, new, form, of, colonialism, the, hotels, operated, by, the, company, were, fully, staffed, by, americans, from, chefs, to, waitresses, in, addition, to, being, owned, by, americans, so, that, the, local, populations, saw, little, economic, benefit, the, company, also, enforced, racial, discrimination, in, many, policies, for, its, fleet, black, passengers, were, assigned, to, inferior, cabins, were, sometimes, denied, bookings, and, were, expected, to, eat, meals, early, before, white, passengers, the, most, popular, early, destinations, were, jamaica, and, the, bahamas, the, bahamas, remains, today, the, most, popular, tourist, destination, in, the, caribbean, post,
