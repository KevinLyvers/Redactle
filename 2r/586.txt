rms, titanic, sank, on, 15, april, 1912, in, the, north, atlantic, ocean, the, largest, ocean, liner, in, service, at, the, time, titanic, was, four, days, into, her, maiden, voyage, from, southampton, to, new, york, city, with, an, estimated, 2, 224, people, on, board, when, she, struck, an, iceberg, at, 23, 40, ship, s, time, on, 14, april, her, sinking, two, hours, and, forty, minutes, later, at, 02, 20, ship, s, time, 05, 18, gmt, on, 15, april, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, more, than, 1, 500, people, making, it, one, of, the, deadliest, peacetime, maritime, disasters, in, history, titanic, received, six, warnings, of, sea, ice, on, 14, april, but, was, travelling, at, a, speed, of, roughly, 22, knots, 41, km, h, when, her, lookouts, sighted, the, iceberg, unable, to, turn, quickly, enough, the, ship, suffered, a, glancing, blow, that, buckled, her, starboard, side, and, opened, six, of, her, sixteen, compartments, to, the, sea, titanic, had, been, designed, to, stay, afloat, with, up, to, four, of, her, forward, compartments, flooded, and, the, crew, used, distress, flares, and, radio, wireless, messages, to, attract, help, as, the, passengers, were, put, into, lifeboats, in, accordance, with, existing, practice, the, titanic, s, lifeboat, system, was, designed, to, ferry, passengers, to, nearby, rescue, vessels, not, to, hold, everyone, on, board, simultaneously, therefore, with, the, ship, sinking, rapidly, and, help, still, hours, away, there, was, no, safe, refuge, for, many, of, the, passengers, and, crew, with, only, twenty, lifeboats, including, four, collapsible, lifeboats, poor, preparation, for, and, management, of, the, evacuation, meant, many, boats, were, launched, before, they, were, completely, full, titanic, sank, with, over, a, thousand, passengers, and, crew, still, on, board, almost, all, of, those, who, ended, up, in, the, water, died, within, minutes, due, to, the, effects, of, cold, shock, and, incapacitation, rms, carpathia, arrived, about, an, hour, and, a, half, after, the, sinking, and, rescued, all, of, the, 710, survivors, by, 09, 15, on, 15, april, the, disaster, shocked, the, world, and, caused, widespread, outrage, over, the, lack, of, lifeboats, lax, regulations, and, the, unequal, treatment, of, third, class, passengers, during, the, evacuation, subsequent, inquiries, recommended, sweeping, changes, to, maritime, regulations, leading, to, the, establishment, in, 1914, of, the, international, convention, for, the, safety, of, life, at, sea, solas, which, still, governs, maritime, safety, today, at, the, time, of, her, entry, into, service, on, 2, april, 1912, the, titanic, was, the, second, of, three, olympic, class, ocean, liners, and, was, the, largest, ship, in, the, world, she, and, the, earlier, rms, olympic, were, almost, one, and, a, half, times, the, gross, register, tonnage, of, cunard, s, rms, lusitania, and, rms, mauretania, the, previous, record, holders, and, were, nearly, 100, feet, 30, m, longer, the, titanic, could, carry, 3, 547, people, in, speed, and, comfort, and, was, built, on, an, unprecedented, scale, her, reciprocating, engines, were, the, largest, that, had, ever, been, built, standing, 40, feet, 12, m, high, and, with, cylinders, 9, feet, 2, 7, m, in, diameter, requiring, the, burning, of, 600, long, tons, 610, t, of, coal, per, day, the, passenger, accommodation, especially, the, first, class, section, was, said, to, be, of, unrivalled, extent, and, magnificence, indicated, by, the, fares, that, first, class, accommodation, commanded, the, parlour, suites, the, most, expensive, and, most, luxurious, suites, on, the, ship, with, private, promenade, cost, over, 4, 350, equivalent, to, 137, 000, today, for, a, one, way, transatlantic, passage, even, third, class, though, considerably, less, luxurious, than, second, and, first, classes, was, unusually, comfortable, by, contemporary, standards, and, was, supplied, with, plentiful, quantities, of, good, food, providing, her, passengers, with, better, conditions, than, many, of, them, had, experienced, at, home, the, titanic, s, maiden, voyage, began, shortly, after, noon, on, 10, april, 1912, when, she, left, southampton, on, the, first, leg, of, her, journey, to, new, york, an, accident, was, narrowly, averted, only, a, few, minutes, later, as, the, titanic, passed, the, moored, liners, ss, city, of, new, york, of, the, american, line, and, oceanic, of, the, white, star, line, the, latter, of, which, would, have, been, her, running, mate, on, the, service, from, southampton, her, huge, displacement, caused, both, of, the, smaller, ships, to, be, lifted, by, a, bulge, of, water, and, then, dropped, into, a, trough, new, york, s, mooring, cables, could, not, take, the, sudden, strain, and, snapped, swinging, her, around, stern, first, towards, the, titanic, a, nearby, tugboat, vulcan, came, to, the, rescue, by, taking, new, york, under, tow, and, titanic, s, 62, year, old, captain, edward, smith, the, most, senior, of, the, white, star, line, s, captains, ordered, her, engines, to, be, put, full, astern, the, two, ships, avoided, a, collision, by, a, distance, of, about, 4, feet, 1, 2, m, the, incident, as, well, as, a, subsequent, stop, to, offload, a, few, stragglers, by, tug, delayed, the, titanic, s, departure, by, at, most, three, quarters, of, an, hour, while, the, drifting, new, york, was, brought, under, control, a, few, hours, later, the, titanic, called, at, cherbourg, harbour, in, north, western, france, a, journey, of, 80, nautical, miles, 148, km, 92, mi, where, she, took, on, passengers, her, next, port, of, call, was, queenstown, now, cobh, in, ireland, which, she, reached, around, midday, on, 11, april, she, left, in, the, afternoon, after, taking, on, more, passengers, and, stores, by, the, time, the, titanic, departed, westwards, across, the, atlantic, she, was, carrying, 892, crew, members, and, 1, 320, passengers, this, was, only, about, half, of, her, full, passenger, capacity, of, 2, 435, as, it, was, the, low, season, and, shipping, from, the, uk, had, been, disrupted, by, a, coal, miners, strike, her, passengers, were, a, cross, section, of, edwardian, society, from, millionaires, such, as, john, jacob, astor, and, benjamin, guggenheim, to, poor, emigrants, from, countries, as, disparate, as, armenia, ireland, italy, sweden, syria, and, russia, seeking, a, new, life, in, the, united, states, captain, smith, had, four, decades, of, seafaring, experience, and, had, served, as, captain, of, rms, olympic, from, which, he, was, transferred, to, command, the, titanic, the, vast, majority, of, the, crew, who, served, under, him, were, not, trained, sailors, but, were, either, engineers, firemen, or, stokers, responsible, for, looking, after, the, engines, or, stewards, and, galley, staff, responsible, for, the, passengers, the, six, watch, officers, and, 39, able, seamen, constituted, only, around, five, percent, of, the, crew, with, the, majority, having, been, taken, on, at, southampton, and, as, a, result, lacked, the, time, to, familiarise, themselves, with, the, ship, the, ice, conditions, were, attributed, to, a, mild, winter, that, caused, large, numbers, of, icebergs, to, shift, off, the, west, coast, of, greenland, a, fire, had, begun, in, one, of, the, titanic, s, coal, bins, approximately, 10, days, before, the, ship, s, departure, and, continued, to, burn, for, several, days, into, the, voyage, but, it, was, extinguished, on, 13, april, the, weather, improved, significantly, during, the, day, from, brisk, winds, and, moderate, seas, in, the, morning, to, a, crystal, clear, calm, by, evening, as, the, ship, s, path, took, her, beneath, an, arctic, high, pressure, system, on, 14, april, 1912, titanic, s, radio, operators, received, six, messages, from, other, ships, warning, of, drifting, ice, which, passengers, on, titanic, had, begun, to, notice, during, the, afternoon, the, ice, conditions, in, the, north, atlantic, were, the, worst, for, any, april, in, the, previous, 50, years, which, was, the, reason, why, the, lookouts, were, unaware, that, they, were, about, to, steam, into, a, line, of, drifting, ice, several, miles, wide, and, many, miles, long, the, radio, operators, did, not, relay, all, of, these, messages, at, the, time, all, wireless, operators, on, ocean, liners, were, employees, of, the, marconi, s, wireless, telegraph, company, and, not, members, of, their, ship, s, crew, as, such, their, primary, responsibility, was, to, send, messages, for, the, passengers, with, weather, reports, as, a, secondary, concern, the, first, warning, came, at, 09, 00, from, rms, caronia, reporting, bergs, growlers, and, field, ice, captain, smith, acknowledged, receipt, of, the, message, at, 13, 42, rms, baltic, relayed, a, report, from, the, greek, ship, athenia, that, she, had, been, passing, icebergs, and, large, quantities, of, field, ice, smith, also, acknowledged, this, report, and, showed, it, to, white, star, line, chairman, j, bruce, ismay, aboard, titanic, for, her, maiden, voyage, smith, ordered, a, new, course, to, be, set, to, take, the, ship, farther, south, at, 13, 45, the, german, ship, ss, amerika, which, was, a, short, distance, to, the, south, reported, she, had, passed, two, large, icebergs, this, message, never, reached, captain, smith, or, the, other, officers, on, titanic, s, bridge, the, reason, is, unclear, but, it, may, have, been, forgotten, because, the, radio, operators, had, to, fix, faulty, equipment, ss, californian, reported, three, large, bergs, at, 19, 30, and, at, 21, 40, the, steamer, mesaba, reported, saw, much, heavy, pack, ice, and, great, number, large, icebergs, also, field, ice, this, message, too, never, left, the, titanic, s, radio, room, the, radio, operator, jack, phillips, may, have, failed, to, grasp, its, significance, because, he, was, preoccupied, with, transmitting, messages, for, passengers, via, the, relay, station, at, cape, race, newfoundland, the, radio, set, had, broken, down, the, day, before, resulting, in, a, backlog, of, messages, that, the, two, operators, were, trying, to, clear, a, final, warning, was, received, at, 22, 30, from, operator, cyril, evans, of, californian, which, had, halted, for, the, night, in, an, ice, field, some, miles, away, but, phillips, cut, it, off, and, signalled, back, shut, up, shut, up, i, m, working, cape, race, although, the, crew, was, aware, of, ice, in, the, vicinity, they, did, not, reduce, the, ship, s, speed, and, continued, to, steam, at, 22, knots, 41, km, h, 25, mph, only, 2, knots, 3, 7, km, h, 2, 3, mph, short, of, her, maximum, speed, titanic, s, high, speed, in, waters, where, ice, had, been, reported, was, later, criticised, as, reckless, but, it, reflected, standard, maritime, practice, at, the, time, according, to, fifth, officer, harold, lowe, the, custom, was, to, go, ahead, and, depend, upon, the, lookouts, in, the, crow, s, nest, and, the, watch, on, the, bridge, to, pick, up, the, ice, in, time, to, avoid, hitting, it, the, north, atlantic, liners, prioritised, time, keeping, above, all, other, considerations, sticking, rigidly, to, a, schedule, that, would, guarantee, their, arrival, at, an, advertised, time, they, were, frequently, operated, at, close, to, their, full, speed, treating, hazard, warnings, as, advisories, rather, than, calls, to, action, it, was, widely, believed, that, ice, posed, little, risk, close, calls, were, not, uncommon, and, even, head, on, collisions, had, not, been, disastrous, in, 1907, ss, kronprinz, wilhelm, a, german, liner, had, rammed, an, iceberg, and, suffered, a, crushed, bow, but, was, still, able, to, complete, her, voyage, that, same, year, titanic, s, future, captain, edward, smith, declared, in, an, interview, that, he, could, not, imagine, any, condition, which, would, cause, a, ship, to, founder, modern, shipbuilding, has, gone, beyond, that, as, titanic, approached, her, fatal, collision, most, passengers, had, gone, to, bed, and, command, of, the, bridge, had, passed, from, second, officer, charles, lightoller, to, first, officer, william, murdoch, lookouts, frederick, fleet, and, reginald, lee, were, in, the, crow, s, nest, 29, metres, 95, ft, above, the, deck, the, air, temperature, had, fallen, to, near, freezing, and, the, ocean, was, completely, calm, colonel, archibald, gracie, one, of, the, survivors, of, the, disaster, later, wrote, that, the, sea, was, like, glass, so, smooth, that, the, stars, were, clearly, reflected, it, is, now, known, that, such, exceptionally, calm, water, is, a, sign, of, nearby, pack, ice, although, the, air, was, clear, there, was, no, moon, and, with, the, sea, so, calm, there, was, nothing, to, give, away, the, position, of, the, nearby, icebergs, had, the, sea, been, rougher, waves, breaking, against, the, icebergs, would, have, made, them, more, visible, because, of, a, mix, up, at, southampton, the, lookouts, had, no, binoculars, however, binoculars, reportedly, would, not, have, been, effective, in, the, darkness, which, was, total, except, for, starlight, and, the, ship, s, own, lights, the, lookouts, were, nonetheless, well, aware, of, the, ice, hazard, as, lightoller, had, ordered, them, and, other, crew, members, to, keep, a, sharp, look, out, for, ice, particularly, small, ice, and, growlers, at, 23, 30, fleet, and, lee, noticed, a, slight, haze, on, the, horizon, ahead, of, them, but, did, not, make, anything, of, it, some, experts, now, believe, that, this, haze, was, actually, a, mirage, caused, by, cold, waters, meeting, warm, air, similar, to, a, water, mirage, in, the, desert, when, titanic, entered, iceberg, alley, this, would, have, resulted, in, a, raised, horizon, blinding, the, lookouts, from, spotting, anything, far, away, nine, minutes, later, at, 23, 39, fleet, spotted, an, iceberg, in, titanic, s, path, he, rang, the, lookout, bell, three, times, and, telephoned, the, bridge, to, inform, sixth, officer, james, moody, fleet, asked, is, there, anyone, there, moody, replied, yes, what, do, you, see, fleet, replied, iceberg, right, ahead, after, thanking, fleet, moody, relayed, the, message, to, murdoch, who, ordered, quartermaster, robert, hichens, to, change, the, ship, s, course, murdoch, is, generally, believed, to, have, given, the, order, hard, a, starboard, which, would, result, in, the, ship, s, tiller, being, moved, all, the, way, to, starboard, in, an, attempt, to, turn, the, ship, to, port, this, reversal, of, directions, when, compared, to, modern, practice, was, common, in, british, ships, of, the, era, he, also, rang, full, astern, on, the, ship, s, telegraphs, according, to, fourth, officer, joseph, boxhall, murdoch, told, captain, smith, that, he, was, attempting, to, hard, a, port, around, suggesting, that, he, was, attempting, a, port, around, manoeuvre, to, first, swing, the, bow, around, the, obstacle, then, swing, the, stern, so, that, both, ends, of, the, ship, would, avoid, a, collision, there, was, a, delay, before, either, order, went, into, effect, the, steam, powered, steering, mechanism, took, up, to, 30, seconds, to, turn, the, ship, s, tiller, and, the, complex, task, of, setting, the, engines, into, reverse, would, also, have, taken, some, time, to, accomplish, because, the, centre, turbine, could, not, be, reversed, both, it, and, the, centre, propeller, positioned, directly, in, front, of, the, ship, s, rudder, were, stopped, this, reduced, the, rudder, s, effectiveness, therefore, impairing, the, turning, ability, of, the, ship, had, murdoch, turned, the, ship, while, maintaining, her, forward, speed, titanic, might, have, missed, the, iceberg, with, feet, to, spare, there, is, evidence, that, murdoch, simply, signalled, the, engine, room, to, stop, not, reverse, lead, fireman, frederick, barrett, testified, that, the, stop, light, came, on, but, even, that, order, was, not, executed, before, the, collision, in, the, event, titanic, s, heading, changed, just, in, time, to, avoid, a, head, on, collision, but, the, change, in, direction, caused, the, ship, to, strike, the, iceberg, with, a, glancing, blow, an, underwater, spur, of, ice, scraped, along, the, starboard, side, of, the, ship, for, about, seven, seconds, chunks, of, ice, dislodged, from, upper, parts, of, the, berg, fell, onto, her, forward, decks, about, five, minutes, after, the, collision, all, of, titanic, s, engines, were, stopped, leaving, the, bow, facing, north, and, the, ship, slowly, drifting, south, in, the, labrador, current, the, impact, with, the, iceberg, was, long, thought, to, have, produced, a, huge, opening, in, titanic, s, hull, not, less, than, 300, feet, 91, m, in, length, 10, feet, 3, m, above, the, level, of, the, keel, as, one, writer, later, put, it, at, the, british, inquiry, following, the, accident, edward, wilding, chief, naval, architect, for, harland, and, wolff, calculating, on, the, basis, of, the, observed, flooding, of, forward, compartments, forty, minutes, after, the, collision, testified, that, the, area, of, the, hull, opened, to, the, sea, was, somewhere, about, 12, square, feet, 1, 1, m, 2, he, also, stated, that, i, believe, it, must, have, been, in, places, not, a, continuous, rip, but, that, the, different, openings, must, have, extended, along, an, area, of, around, 300, feet, to, account, for, the, flooding, in, several, compartments, the, findings, of, the, inquiry, state, that, the, damage, extended, over, a, length, of, about, 300, feet, and, hence, many, subsequent, writers, followed, this, more, vague, statement, modern, ultrasound, surveys, of, the, wreck, have, found, that, the, actual, damage, to, the, hull, was, very, similar, to, wilding, s, statement, consisting, of, six, narrow, openings, covering, a, total, area, of, only, about, 12, to, 13, square, feet, 1, 1, to, 1, 2, m, 2, according, to, paul, k, matthias, who, made, the, measurements, the, damage, consisted, of, a, series, of, deformations, in, the, starboard, side, that, start, and, stop, along, the, hull, about, 10, feet, 3, m, above, the, bottom, of, the, ship, the, gaps, the, longest, of, which, measures, about, 39, feet, 12, m, long, appear, to, have, followed, the, line, of, the, hull, plates, this, suggests, that, the, iron, rivets, along, the, plate, seams, snapped, off, or, popped, open, to, create, narrow, gaps, through, which, water, flooded, wilding, suggested, this, scenario, at, the, british, wreck, commissioner, s, inquiry, following, the, disaster, but, his, view, was, discounted, titanic, s, discoverer, robert, ballard, has, commented, that, the, assumption, that, the, ship, had, suffered, a, major, breach, was, a, by, product, of, the, mystique, of, the, titanic, no, one, could, believe, that, the, great, ship, was, sunk, by, a, little, sliver, faults, in, the, ship, s, hull, may, have, been, a, contributing, factor, recovered, pieces, of, titanic, s, hull, plates, appear, to, have, shattered, on, impact, with, the, iceberg, without, bending, the, plates, in, the, central, part, of, titanic, s, hull, covering, approximately, 60, per, cent, of, the, total, were, held, together, with, triple, rows, of, mild, steel, rivets, but, the, plates, in, the, bow, and, stern, were, held, together, with, double, rows, of, wrought, iron, rivets, which, may, have, been, near, their, stress, limits, even, before, the, collision, these, best, or, no, 3, iron, rivets, had, a, high, level, of, slag, inclusions, making, them, more, brittle, than, the, more, usual, best, best, no, 4, iron, rivets, and, more, prone, to, snapping, when, put, under, stress, particularly, in, extreme, cold, tom, mccluskie, a, retired, archivist, of, harland, wolff, pointed, out, that, olympic, titanic, s, sister, ship, was, riveted, with, the, same, iron, and, served, without, incident, for, nearly, 25, years, surviving, several, major, collisions, including, being, rammed, by, a, british, cruiser, when, olympic, rammed, and, sank, the, u, boat, u, 103, with, her, bow, the, stem, was, twisted, and, hull, plates, on, the, starboard, side, were, buckled, without, impairing, the, hull, s, integrity, above, the, waterline, there, was, little, evidence, of, the, collision, the, stewards, in, the, first, class, dining, room, noticed, a, shudder, which, they, thought, might, have, been, caused, by, the, ship, shedding, a, propeller, blade, many, of, the, passengers, felt, a, bump, or, shudder, just, as, though, we, went, over, about, a, thousand, marbles, as, one, survivor, put, it, but, did, not, know, what, had, happened, those, on, the, lowest, decks, nearest, the, site, of, the, collision, felt, it, much, more, directly, engine, oiler, walter, hurst, recalled, being, awakened, by, a, grinding, crash, along, the, starboard, side, no, one, was, very, much, alarmed, but, knew, we, had, struck, something, fireman, george, kemish, heard, a, heavy, thud, and, grinding, tearing, sound, from, the, starboard, hull, the, ship, began, to, flood, immediately, with, water, pouring, in, at, an, estimated, rate, of, 7, long, tons, 7, 1, t, per, second, fifteen, times, faster, than, it, could, be, pumped, out, second, engineer, j, h, hesketh, and, leading, stoker, frederick, barrett, were, both, struck, by, a, jet, of, icy, water, in, no, 6, boiler, room, and, escaped, just, before, the, room, s, watertight, door, closed, this, was, an, extremely, dangerous, situation, for, the, engineering, staff, the, boilers, were, still, full, of, hot, high, pressure, steam, and, there, was, a, substantial, risk, that, they, would, explode, if, they, came, into, contact, with, the, cold, seawater, flooding, the, boiler, rooms, the, stokers, and, firemen, were, ordered, to, reduce, the, fires, and, vent, the, boilers, sending, great, quantities, of, steam, up, the, funnel, venting, pipes, they, were, waist, deep, in, freezing, water, by, the, time, they, finished, their, work, titanic, s, lower, decks, were, divided, into, sixteen, compartments, each, compartment, was, separated, from, its, neighbour, by, a, bulkhead, running, the, width, of, the, ship, there, were, fifteen, bulkheads, in, all, each, bulkhead, extended, at, least, to, the, underside, of, e, deck, nominally, one, deck, or, about, 11, feet, 3, 4, m, above, the, waterline, the, two, nearest, the, bow, and, the, six, nearest, the, stern, went, one, deck, further, up, each, bulkhead, could, be, sealed, by, watertight, doors, the, engine, rooms, and, boiler, rooms, on, the, tank, top, deck, had, vertically, closing, doors, that, could, be, controlled, remotely, from, the, bridge, lowered, automatically, by, a, float, if, water, was, present, or, closed, manually, by, the, crew, these, took, about, 30, seconds, to, close, warning, bells, and, alternative, escape, routes, were, provided, so, that, the, crew, would, not, be, trapped, by, the, doors, above, the, tank, top, level, on, the, orlop, deck, f, deck, and, e, deck, the, doors, closed, horizontally, and, were, manually, operated, they, could, be, closed, at, the, door, itself, or, from, the, deck, above, although, the, watertight, bulkheads, extended, well, above, the, water, line, they, were, not, sealed, at, the, top, if, too, many, compartments, were, flooded, the, ship, s, bow, would, settle, deeper, in, the, water, and, water, would, spill, from, one, compartment, to, the, next, in, sequence, rather, like, water, spilling, across, the, top, of, an, ice, cube, tray, this, is, what, happened, to, titanic, which, had, suffered, damage, to, the, forepeak, tank, the, three, forward, holds, no, 6, boiler, room, and, a, small, section, of, no, 5, boiler, room, a, total, of, six, compartments, titanic, was, only, designed, to, float, with, any, two, compartments, flooded, but, she, could, remain, afloat, with, certain, combinations, of, three, or, even, four, compartments, the, first, four, open, to, the, ocean, with, five, or, more, compartments, breached, however, the, tops, of, the, bulkheads, would, be, submerged, and, the, ship, would, continue, to, flood, captain, smith, felt, the, collision, in, his, cabin, and, immediately, came, to, the, bridge, informed, of, the, situation, he, summoned, thomas, andrews, titanic, s, builder, who, was, among, a, party, of, engineers, from, harland, and, wolff, observing, the, ship, s, first, passenger, voyage, the, ship, was, listing, five, degrees, to, starboard, and, was, two, degrees, down, by, the, head, within, a, few, minutes, of, the, collision, smith, and, andrews, went, below, and, found, that, the, forward, cargo, holds, the, mail, room, and, the, squash, court, were, flooded, while, no, 6, boiler, room, was, already, filled, to, a, depth, of, 14, feet, 4, 3, m, water, was, spilling, over, into, no, 5, boiler, room, and, crewmen, there, were, battling, to, pump, it, out, within, 45, minutes, of, the, collision, at, least, 13, 500, long, tons, 13, 700, t, of, water, had, entered, the, ship, this, was, far, too, much, for, titanic, s, ballast, and, bilge, pumps, to, handle, the, total, pumping, capacity, of, all, the, pumps, combined, was, only, 1, 700, long, tons, 1, 700, t, per, hour, andrews, informed, the, captain, that, the, first, five, compartments, were, flooded, and, therefore, titanic, was, doomed, andrews, accurately, predicted, that, she, could, remain, afloat, for, no, longer, than, roughly, two, hours, from, the, time, of, the, collision, to, the, moment, of, her, sinking, at, least, 35, 000, long, tons, 36, 000, t, of, water, flooded, into, titanic, causing, her, displacement, to, nearly, double, from, 48, 300, long, tons, 49, 100, t, to, over, 83, 000, long, tons, 84, 000, t, the, flooding, did, not, proceed, at, a, constant, pace, nor, was, it, distributed, evenly, throughout, the, ship, due, to, the, configuration, of, the, flooded, compartments, her, initial, list, to, starboard, was, caused, by, asymmetrical, flooding, of, the, starboard, side, as, water, poured, down, a, passageway, at, the, bottom, of, the, ship, when, the, passageway, was, fully, flooded, the, list, corrected, itself, but, the, ship, later, began, to, list, to, port, by, up, to, ten, degrees, as, that, side, also, flooded, asymmetrically, titanic, s, down, angle, altered, fairly, rapidly, from, zero, degrees, to, about, four, and, a, half, degrees, during, the, first, hour, after, the, collision, but, the, rate, at, which, the, ship, went, down, slowed, greatly, for, the, second, hour, worsening, only, to, about, five, degrees, this, gave, many, of, those, aboard, a, false, sense, of, hope, that, the, ship, might, stay, afloat, long, enough, for, them, to, be, rescued, by, 01, 30, the, sinking, rate, of, the, front, section, increased, until, titanic, reached, a, down, angle, of, about, ten, degrees, at, about, 02, 15, titanic, s, angle, in, the, water, began, to, increase, rapidly, as, water, poured, into, previously, unflooded, parts, of, the, ship, through, deck, hatches, disappearing, from, view, at, 02, 20, at, 00, 05, on, 15, april, captain, smith, ordered, the, ship, s, lifeboats, uncovered, and, the, passengers, mustered, by, now, many, passengers, were, awaking, having, noticed, the, engines, and, their, accompanying, vibrations, had, suddenly, stopped, he, also, ordered, the, radio, operators, to, begin, sending, distress, calls, which, wrongly, placed, the, ship, on, the, west, side, of, the, ice, belt, and, directed, rescuers, to, a, position, that, turned, out, to, be, inaccurate, by, about, 13, 5, nautical, miles, 15, 5, mi, 25, 0, km, below, decks, water, was, pouring, into, the, lowest, levels, of, the, ship, as, the, mail, room, flooded, the, mail, sorters, made, an, ultimately, futile, attempt, to, save, the, 400, 000, items, of, mail, being, carried, aboard, titanic, elsewhere, air, could, be, heard, being, forced, out, by, inrushing, water, above, them, stewards, went, door, to, door, rousing, sleeping, passengers, and, crew, titanic, did, not, have, a, public, address, system, and, told, them, to, go, to, the, boat, deck, the, thoroughness, of, the, muster, was, heavily, dependent, on, the, class, of, the, passengers, the, first, class, stewards, were, in, charge, of, only, a, few, cabins, while, those, responsible, for, the, second, and, third, class, passengers, had, to, manage, large, numbers, of, people, the, first, class, stewards, provided, hands, on, assistance, helping, their, charges, to, get, dressed, and, bringing, them, out, onto, the, deck, with, far, more, people, to, deal, with, the, second, and, third, class, stewards, mostly, confined, their, efforts, to, throwing, open, doors, and, telling, passengers, to, put, on, lifebelts, and, come, up, top, in, third, class, passengers, were, largely, left, to, their, own, devices, after, being, informed, of, the, need, to, come, on, deck, many, passengers, and, crew, were, reluctant, to, comply, either, refusing, to, believe, that, there, was, a, problem, or, preferring, the, warmth, of, the, ship, s, interior, to, the, bitterly, cold, night, air, the, passengers, were, not, told, that, the, ship, was, sinking, though, a, few, noticed, that, she, was, listing, around, 00, 15, the, stewards, began, ordering, the, passengers, to, put, on, their, lifebelts, though, again, many, passengers, took, the, order, as, a, joke, some, set, about, playing, an, impromptu, game, of, association, football, with, the, ice, chunks, that, were, now, strewn, across, the, foredeck, on, the, boat, deck, as, the, crew, began, preparing, the, lifeboats, it, was, difficult, to, hear, anything, over, the, noise, of, high, pressure, steam, being, vented, from, the, boilers, and, escaping, via, the, valves, on, the, funnels, above, lawrence, beesley, described, the, sound, as, a, harsh, deafening, boom, that, made, conversation, difficult, if, one, imagines, 20, locomotives, blowing, off, steam, in, a, low, key, it, would, give, some, idea, of, the, unpleasant, sound, that, met, us, as, we, climbed, out, on, the, top, deck, the, noise, was, so, loud, that, the, crew, had, to, use, hand, signals, to, communicate, titanic, had, a, total, of, 20, lifeboats, comprising, 16, wooden, boats, on, davits, eight, on, either, side, of, the, ship, and, four, collapsible, boats, with, wooden, bottoms, and, canvas, sides, the, collapsibles, were, stored, upside, down, with, the, sides, folded, in, and, would, have, to, be, erected, and, moved, to, the, davits, for, launching, two, were, stored, under, the, wooden, boats, and, the, other, two, were, lashed, atop, the, officers, quarters, the, position, of, the, latter, would, make, them, extremely, difficult, to, launch, as, they, weighed, several, tons, each, and, had, to, be, manhandled, down, to, the, boat, deck, on, average, the, lifeboats, could, take, up, to, 68, people, each, and, collectively, they, could, accommodate, 1, 178, barely, half, the, number, of, people, on, board, and, a, third, of, the, number, the, ship, was, licensed, to, carry, the, shortage, of, lifeboats, was, not, because, of, a, lack, of, space, nor, because, of, cost, titanic, had, been, designed, to, accommodate, up, to, 68, lifeboats, enough, for, everyone, on, board, and, the, price, of, an, extra, 32, lifeboats, would, only, have, been, some, us, 16, 000, equivalent, to, 505, 000, in, 2023, less, than, 1, of, the, 7, 5, million, that, the, company, had, spent, on, titanic, in, an, emergency, at, the, time, lifeboats, were, intended, to, be, used, to, transfer, passengers, off, the, distressed, ship, and, onto, a, nearby, vessel, it, was, therefore, commonplace, for, liners, to, have, far, fewer, lifeboats, than, needed, to, accommodate, all, their, passengers, and, crew, and, of, the, 39, british, liners, of, the, time, of, over, 10, 000, long, tons, 10, 000, t, 33, had, too, few, lifeboat, places, to, accommodate, everyone, on, board, the, white, star, line, desired, the, ship, to, have, a, wide, promenade, deck, with, uninterrupted, views, of, the, sea, which, would, have, been, obstructed, by, a, continuous, row, of, lifeboats, captain, smith, was, an, experienced, seaman, who, had, served, for, 40, years, at, sea, including, 27, years, in, command, this, was, the, first, crisis, of, his, career, and, he, would, have, known, that, even, if, all, the, boats, were, fully, occupied, more, than, a, thousand, people, would, remain, on, the, ship, as, she, sank, with, little, or, no, chance, of, survival, several, sources, later, contended, that, upon, grasping, the, enormity, of, what, was, about, to, happen, captain, smith, became, paralysed, by, indecision, had, a, mental, breakdown, or, nervous, collapse, and, was, lost, in, a, trance, like, daze, being, ineffective, and, inactive, in, attempting, to, mitigate, the, loss, of, life, however, according, to, survivors, smith, took, charge, and, behaved, coolly, and, calmly, during, the, crisis, after, the, collision, smith, immediately, began, an, investigation, into, the, nature, and, extent, of, the, damage, personally, making, two, inspection, trips, below, deck, to, look, for, damage, and, preparing, the, wireless, men, for, the, possibility, of, having, to, call, for, help, he, erred, on, the, side, of, caution, by, ordering, his, crew, to, begin, preparing, the, lifeboats, for, loading, and, to, get, the, passengers, into, their, lifebelts, before, he, was, told, by, andrews, that, the, ship, was, sinking, smith, was, observed, all, around, the, decks, personally, overseeing, and, helping, to, load, the, lifeboats, interacting, with, passengers, and, trying, to, instil, urgency, to, follow, evacuation, orders, while, avoiding, panic, fourth, officer, boxhall, was, told, by, smith, at, around, 00, 25, that, the, ship, would, sink, while, quartermaster, george, rowe, was, so, unaware, of, the, emergency, that, after, the, evacuation, had, started, he, phoned, the, bridge, from, his, watch, station, to, ask, why, he, had, just, seen, a, lifeboat, go, past, the, crew, was, unprepared, for, the, emergency, as, lifeboat, training, had, been, minimal, only, one, lifeboat, drill, had, been, conducted, while, the, ship, was, docked, at, southampton, it, was, a, cursory, effort, consisting, of, two, boats, being, lowered, each, manned, by, one, officer, and, four, men, who, merely, rowed, around, the, dock, for, a, few, minutes, before, returning, to, the, ship, the, boats, were, supposed, to, be, stocked, with, emergency, supplies, but, titanic, s, passengers, later, found, that, they, had, only, been, partially, provisioned, despite, the, efforts, of, the, ship, s, chief, baker, charles, joughin, and, his, staff, to, do, so, no, lifeboat, or, fire, drills, had, been, conducted, since, titanic, left, southampton, a, lifeboat, drill, had, been, scheduled, for, the, sunday, morning, before, the, ship, sank, but, was, cancelled, by, captain, smith, for, unknown, reasons, lists, had, been, posted, on, the, ship, assigning, crew, members, to, specific, lifeboat, stations, but, few, appeared, to, have, read, them, or, to, have, known, what, they, were, supposed, to, do, most, of, the, crew, were, not, seamen, and, some, even, had, no, prior, experience, of, rowing, a, boat, they, were, now, faced, with, the, complex, task, of, coordinating, the, lowering, of, 20, boats, carrying, a, possible, total, of, 1, 100, people, 70, feet, 21, m, down, the, sides, of, the, ship, thomas, e, bonsall, a, historian, of, the, disaster, has, commented, that, the, evacuation, was, so, badly, organised, that, even, if, they, had, the, number, lifeboats, they, needed, it, is, impossible, to, see, how, they, could, have, launched, them, given, the, lack, of, time, and, poor, leadership, indeed, not, all, of, the, lifeboats, on, board, titanic, were, launched, before, the, ship, sank, by, about, 00, 20, 40, minutes, after, the, collision, the, loading, of, the, lifeboats, was, under, way, second, officer, lightoller, recalled, afterwards, that, he, had, to, cup, both, hands, over, smith, s, ears, to, communicate, over, the, racket, of, escaping, steam, and, said, i, yelled, at, the, top, of, my, voice, hadn, t, we, better, get, the, women, and, children, into, the, boats, sir, he, heard, me, and, nodded, reply, smith, then, ordered, lightoller, and, murdoch, to, put, the, women, and, children, in, and, lower, away, lightoller, took, charge, of, the, boats, on, the, port, side, and, murdoch, took, charge, of, those, on, the, starboard, side, the, two, officers, interpreted, the, women, and, children, evacuation, order, differently, murdoch, took, it, to, mean, women, and, children, first, while, lightoller, took, it, to, mean, women, and, children, only, lightoller, lowered, lifeboats, with, empty, seats, if, there, were, no, women, and, children, waiting, to, board, while, murdoch, allowed, a, limited, number, of, men, to, board, if, all, the, nearby, women, and, children, had, embarked, neither, officer, knew, how, many, people, could, safely, be, carried, in, the, boats, as, they, were, lowered, and, they, both, erred, on, the, side, of, caution, by, not, filling, them, they, could, have, been, lowered, quite, safely, with, their, full, complement, of, 68, people, especially, with, the, highly, favourable, weather, and, sea, conditions, had, this, been, done, an, additional, 500, people, could, have, been, saved, instead, hundreds, of, people, predominantly, men, were, left, on, board, as, lifeboats, were, launched, with, many, seats, vacant, few, passengers, at, first, were, willing, to, board, the, lifeboats, and, the, officers, in, charge, of, the, evacuation, found, it, difficult, to, persuade, them, millionaire, john, jacob, astor, declared, we, are, safer, here, than, in, that, little, boat, some, passengers, refused, flatly, to, embark, j, bruce, ismay, realising, the, urgency, of, the, situation, roamed, the, starboard, boat, deck, urging, passengers, and, crew, to, board, the, boats, a, trickle, of, women, couples, and, single, men, were, persuaded, to, board, starboard, lifeboat, no, 7, which, became, the, first, lifeboat, to, be, lowered, at, 00, 45, lifeboat, no, 7, was, rowed, away, from, titanic, with, an, estimated, 28, passengers, on, board, despite, a, capacity, of, 65, lifeboat, no, 6, on, the, port, side, was, the, next, to, be, lowered, at, 00, 55, it, also, had, 28, people, on, board, among, them, the, unsinkable, margaret, molly, brown, lightoller, realised, there, was, only, one, seaman, on, board, quartermaster, robert, hichens, and, called, for, volunteers, major, arthur, godfrey, peuchen, of, the, royal, canadian, yacht, club, stepped, forward, and, climbed, down, a, rope, into, the, lifeboat, he, was, the, only, adult, male, passenger, whom, lightoller, allowed, to, board, during, the, port, side, evacuation, peuchen, s, role, highlighted, a, key, problem, during, the, evacuation, there, were, hardly, any, seamen, to, man, the, boats, some, had, been, sent, below, to, open, gangway, doors, to, allow, more, passengers, to, be, evacuated, but, they, never, returned, they, were, presumably, trapped, and, drowned, by, the, rising, water, below, decks, meanwhile, other, crewmen, fought, to, maintain, vital, services, as, water, continued, to, pour, into, the, ship, below, decks, the, engineers, and, firemen, worked, to, vent, steam, from, the, boilers, to, prevent, them, from, exploding, on, contact, with, the, cold, water, they, re, opened, watertight, doors, in, order, to, set, up, extra, portable, pumps, in, the, forward, compartments, in, a, futile, bid, to, reduce, the, torrent, and, kept, the, electrical, generators, running, to, maintain, lights, and, power, throughout, the, ship, steward, frederick, dent, ray, narrowly, avoided, being, swept, away, when, a, wooden, wall, between, his, quarters, and, the, third, class, accommodation, on, e, deck, collapsed, leaving, him, waist, deep, in, water, two, engineers, herbert, harvey, and, jonathan, shepherd, who, had, just, broken, his, left, leg, after, falling, into, a, manhole, minutes, earlier, died, in, boiler, room, no, 5, when, at, around, 00, 45, the, bunker, door, separating, it, from, the, flooded, no, 6, boiler, room, collapsed, and, they, were, swept, away, by, a, wave, of, green, foam, according, to, leading, fireman, frederick, barrett, who, barely, escaped, from, the, boiler, room, in, boiler, room, no, 4, at, around, 01, 20, according, to, survivor, trimmer, george, cavell, water, began, flooding, in, from, the, metal, floor, plates, below, possibly, indicating, that, the, bottom, of, the, ship, had, also, been, holed, by, the, iceberg, the, flow, of, water, soon, overwhelmed, the, pumps, and, forced, the, firemen, and, trimmers, to, evacuate, the, boiler, room, further, aft, chief, engineer, bell, his, engineering, colleagues, and, a, handful, of, volunteer, firemen, and, greasers, stayed, behind, in, the, unflooded, no, 1, 2, and, 3, boiler, rooms, and, in, the, turbine, and, reciprocating, engine, rooms, they, continued, working, on, the, boilers, and, the, electrical, generators, in, order, to, keep, the, ship, s, lights, and, pumps, operable, and, to, power, the, radio, so, that, distress, signals, could, be, sent, several, sources, contend, they, remained, at, their, posts, until, the, very, end, thus, ensuring, that, titanic, s, electrics, functioned, until, the, final, minutes, of, the, sinking, and, died, in, the, bowels, of, the, ship, however, there, is, evidence, to, suggest, when, it, became, obvious, that, nothing, more, could, be, done, and, the, flooding, in, the, forward, compartments, was, too, severe, for, the, pumps, to, cope, some, of, the, engineers, and, other, crewmen, abandoned, their, posts, and, came, up, onto, titanic, s, deck, but, by, this, time, all, the, lifeboats, had, left, greaser, frederick, scott, testified, he, saw, eight, of, the, ship, s, 35, engineers, gathered, at, the, aft, end, of, the, starboard, boat, deck, none, of, the, ship, s, 35, engineers, and, electricians, survived, neither, did, any, of, the, titanic, s, five, postal, clerks, who, were, last, seen, struggling, to, save, the, mail, bags, they, had, rescued, from, the, flooded, mail, room, they, were, caught, by, the, rising, water, somewhere, on, d, deck, many, of, the, third, class, passengers, were, also, confronted, with, the, sight, of, water, pouring, into, their, quarters, on, e, f, and, g, decks, carl, jansson, one, of, the, relatively, small, number, of, third, class, survivors, later, recalled, then, i, run, down, to, my, cabin, to, bring, my, other, clothes, watch, and, bag, but, only, had, time, to, take, the, watch, and, coat, when, water, with, enormous, force, came, into, the, cabin, and, i, had, to, rush, up, to, the, deck, again, where, i, found, my, friends, standing, with, lifebelts, on, and, with, terror, painted, on, their, faces, what, should, i, do, now, with, no, lifebelt, and, no, shoes, and, no, cap, the, lifeboats, were, lowered, every, few, minutes, on, each, side, but, most, of, the, boats, were, greatly, under, filled, no, 5, left, with, 41, aboard, no, 3, had, 32, aboard, no, 8, left, with, 39, and, no, 1, left, with, just, 12, out, of, a, capacity, of, 40, the, evacuation, did, not, go, smoothly, and, passengers, suffered, accidents, and, injuries, as, it, progressed, one, woman, fell, between, lifeboat, no, 10, and, the, side, of, the, ship, but, someone, caught, her, by, the, ankle, and, hauled, her, back, onto, the, promenade, deck, where, she, made, a, successful, second, attempt, at, boarding, first, class, passenger, annie, stengel, had, several, ribs, broken, when, a, german, american, doctor, and, his, brother, jumped, into, no, 5, squashing, her, and, knocking, her, unconscious, the, lifeboats, descent, was, likewise, risky, no, 6, was, nearly, flooded, during, the, descent, by, water, discharging, out, of, the, ship, s, side, but, successfully, made, it, away, from, the, ship, no, 3, came, close, to, disaster, when, for, a, time, one, of, the, davits, jammed, threatening, to, pitch, the, passengers, out, of, the, lifeboat, and, into, the, sea, by, 01, 20, the, seriousness, of, the, situation, was, now, apparent, to, the, passengers, above, decks, who, began, saying, their, goodbyes, with, husbands, escorting, their, wives, and, children, to, the, lifeboats, distress, flares, were, fired, every, few, minutes, to, attract, the, attention, of, any, ships, nearby, and, the, radio, operators, repeatedly, sent, the, distress, signal, cqd, radio, operator, harold, bride, suggested, to, his, colleague, jack, phillips, that, he, should, use, the, sos, signal, as, it, may, be, your, last, chance, to, send, it, contrary, to, what, bride, thought, sos, was, not, a, new, call, having, been, used, many, times, before, the, two, radio, operators, contacted, other, ships, to, ask, for, assistance, several, responded, of, which, rms, carpathia, was, the, closest, at, 58, miles, 93, km, away, she, was, a, much, slower, vessel, than, titanic, and, even, driven, at, her, maximum, speed, of, 17, kn, 20, mph, 31, km, h, would, take, four, hours, to, reach, the, sinking, ship, another, to, respond, was, ss, mount, temple, which, set, a, course, and, headed, for, titanic, s, position, but, was, stopped, en, route, by, pack, ice, much, nearer, was, ss, californian, which, had, warned, titanic, of, ice, a, few, hours, earlier, apprehensive, at, his, ship, being, caught, in, a, large, field, of, drift, ice, californian, s, captain, stanley, lord, had, decided, at, about, 22, 00, to, halt, for, the, night, and, wait, for, daylight, to, find, a, way, through, the, ice, field, at, 23, 30, 10, minutes, before, titanic, hit, the, iceberg, californian, s, sole, radio, operator, cyril, evans, shut, his, set, down, for, the, night, and, went, to, bed, on, the, bridge, her, third, officer, charles, groves, saw, a, large, vessel, to, starboard, around, 10, to, 12, mi, 16, to, 19, km, away, it, made, a, sudden, turn, to, port, and, stopped, if, the, radio, operator, of, californian, had, stayed, at, his, post, fifteen, minutes, longer, hundreds, of, lives, might, have, been, saved, a, little, over, an, hour, later, second, officer, herbert, stone, saw, five, white, rockets, exploding, above, the, stopped, ship, unsure, what, the, rockets, meant, he, called, captain, lord, who, was, resting, in, the, chartroom, and, reported, the, sighting, lord, did, not, act, on, the, report, but, stone, was, perturbed, a, ship, is, not, going, to, fire, rockets, at, sea, for, nothing, he, told, a, colleague, by, this, time, it, was, clear, to, those, on, titanic, that, the, ship, was, indeed, sinking, and, there, would, not, be, enough, lifeboat, places, for, everyone, some, still, clung, to, the, hope, that, the, worst, would, not, happen, when, eloise, hughes, smith, pleaded, whether, lucian, her, husband, of, two, months, could, go, with, her, captain, smith, ignored, her, shouting, again, through, his, megaphone, the, message, of, women, and, children, first, lucian, said, never, mind, captain, about, that, i, will, see, that, she, gets, in, the, boat, before, telling, eloise, i, never, expected, to, ask, you, to, obey, but, this, is, one, time, you, must, it, is, only, a, matter, of, form, to, have, women, and, children, first, the, ship, is, thoroughly, equipped, and, everyone, on, her, will, be, saved, tillie, taussig, had, to, be, dragged, away, from, her, husband, emil, taussig, and, put, into, lifeboat, 8, with, her, daughter, when, celiney, yasbeck, saw,

his, life, vest, and, sweater, into, top, hat, and, evening, dress, and, declared, his, wish, to, go, down, like, a, gentleman, at, this, point, the, vast, majority, of, passengers, who, had, boarded, lifeboats, were, from, first, and, second, class, few, third, class, steerage, passengers, had, made, it, up, onto, the, deck, and, most, were, still, lost, in, the, maze, of, corridors, or, trapped, behind, gates, and, partitions, that, segregated, the, accommodation, for, the, steerage, passengers, from, the, first, and, second, class, areas, this, segregation, was, not, simply, for, social, reasons, but, was, a, requirement, of, united, states, immigration, laws, which, mandated, that, third, class, passengers, be, segregated, to, control, immigration, and, to, prevent, the, spread, of, infectious, diseases, first, and, second, class, passengers, on, transatlantic, liners, disembarked, at, the, main, piers, on, manhattan, island, but, steerage, passengers, had, to, go, through, health, checks, and, processing, at, ellis, island, in, at, least, some, places, titanic, s, crew, appear, to, have, actively, hindered, the, steerage, passengers, escape, some, of, the, gates, were, locked, and, guarded, by, crew, members, apparently, to, prevent, the, steerage, passengers, from, rushing, the, lifeboats, irish, survivor, margaret, murphy, wrote, in, may, 1912, before, all, the,

trying, to, get, up, to, a, higher, deck, and, were, fighting, the, sailors, all, striking, and, scuffling, and, swearing, women, and, some, children, were, there, praying, and, crying, then, the, sailors, fastened, down, the, hatchways, leading, to, the, third, class, section, they, said, they, wanted, to, keep, the, air, down, there, so, the, vessel, could, stay, up, longer, it, meant, all,

the, extreme, ends, of, the, decks, and, so, was, the, farthest, away, from, the, lifeboats, by, contrast, the, first, class, accommodation, was, located, on, the, upper, decks, and, so, was, nearest, proximity, to, the, lifeboats, thus, became, a, key, factor, in, determining, who, got, into, them, to, add, to, the, difficulty, many, of, the, steerage, passengers, did, not, understand, or, speak, english, it, was, perhaps, no, coincidence, that, english, speaking, irish, immigrants, were, disproportionately, represented, among, the, steerage, passengers, who, survived, many, of, those, who, did, survive, owed, their, lives, to, third, class, steward, john, edward, hart, who, organised, three, trips, into, the, ship, s, interior, to, escort, groups, of, third, class, passengers, up, to, the, boat, deck, others, made, their, way, through, open, gates, or, climbed, emergency, ladders, some, perhaps, overwhelmed, by, it, all, made, no, attempt, to, escape, and, stayed, in, their, cabins, or, congregated, in, prayer, in, the, third, class, dining, room, leading, fireman, charles, hendrickson, saw, crowds, of, third, class, passengers, below, decks, with, their, trunks, and,

including, third, class, passenger, eugene, daly, and, first, class, passenger, george, rheims, claimed, to, have, seen, an, officer, shoot, one, or, two, men, during, a, rush, for, a, lifeboat, then, shoot, himself, it, was, rumoured, that, murdoch, was, the, officer, thomas, andrews, was, reportedly, last, seen, in, the, first, class, smoking, room, after, approximately, 02, 05, apparently, making, no, attempt, to, escape, however, other, reports, suggest, that, andrews, may, have, been, in, the, smoking, room, before, 01, 40, and, that, he, then, continued, assisting, with, the, evacuation, he, was, reportedly, seen, throwing, deck, chairs, into, the, ocean, for, passengers, to, cling, to, in, the, water, and, heading, to, the, bridge, perhaps, to, search, for, captain, smith, captain, smith, carried, out, a, final, tour, of, the, deck, telling, the, radio, operators, and, other, crew, members, now, it, s, every, man, for, himself, and, told, men, attempting, to, launch, collapsible, boat, a, well, boys, do, your, best, for, the, women, and, children, and, look, out, for, yourselves, and, returned, to, the, bridge, just, before, the, ship, began, its, final, plunge, it, is, thought, that, he, may, have, chosen, to, go, down, with, his, ship, and, died, on, the, bridge, when, it, submerged, however, several, survivors, including, harold, bride, saw, smith, jump, overboard, from, the, bridge, mess, steward, cecil, fitzpatrick, claimed, to, have, seen, andrews, jump, overboard, with, smith, as, most, of, the, passengers, and, crew, headed, to, the, stern, where, the, priest, thomas, byles, a, second, class, passenger, was, hearing, confessions, and, giving, absolutions, titanic, s, band, played, outside, the, gymnasium, titanic, had, two, separate, bands, of, musicians, one, was, a, quintet, led, by, wallace, hartley, that, played, after, dinner, and, at, religious, services, while, the, other, was, a, trio, who, played, in, the, reception, area, and, outside, the, caf, and, restaurant, the, two, bands, had, separate, music, libraries, and, arrangements, and, had, not, played, together, before, the, sinking, around, 30, minutes, after, colliding, with, the, iceberg, the, two, bands, were, probably, called, by, chief, purser, mcelroy, or, captain, smith, and, ordered, to, play, in, the, first, class, lounge, passengers, present, remember, them, playing, lively, tunes, such, as, alexander, s, ragtime, band, it, is, unknown, if, the, two, piano, players, were, with, the, band, at, this, time, the, exact, time, is, unknown, but, the, musicians, later, moved, to, the, boat, deck, level, of, the, first, class, entrance, contrary, to, belief, there, is, no, evidence, they, moved, onto, the, deck, itself, but, remained, inside, as, steward, edward, brown, claimed, to, have, seen, them, at, the, top, of, the, staircase, in, the, first, class, entrance, part, of, the, enduring, folklore, of, the, titanic, sinking, is, that, the, musicians, played, the, hymn, nearer, my, god, to, thee, as, the, ship, sank, though, some, regard, this, as, dubious, nonetheless, the, claim, surfaced, among, the, earliest, reports, of, the, sinking, and, the, hymn, became, so, closely, associated, with, the, titanic, disaster, that, its, opening, bars, were, carved, on, the, grave, monument, of, titanic, s, bandmaster, wallace, hartley, archibald, gracie, emphatically, denied, it, in, his, account, written, soon, after, the, sinking, and, harold, bride, said, that, he, had, heard, the, band, playing, ragtime, then, autumn, by, which, he, may, have, meant, archibald, joyce, s, then, popular, waltz, songe, d, automne, autumn, dream, george, orrell, the, bandmaster, of, the, rescue, ship, carpathia, who, spoke, with, survivors, said, the, ship, s, band, in, any, emergency, is, expected, to, play, to, calm, the, passengers, after, titanic, struck, the, iceberg, the, band, began, to, play, bright, music, dance, music, comic, songs, anything, that, would, prevent, the, passengers, from, becoming, panic, stricken, various, awe, stricken, passengers, began, to, think, of, the, death, that, faced, them, and, asked, the, bandmaster, to, play, hymns, the, one, which, appealed, to, all, was, nearer, my, god, to, thee, according, to, gracie, the, tunes, played, by, the, band, were, cheerful, but, he, did, not, recognise, any, of, them, said, that, if, they, had, played, nearer, my, god, to, thee, he, should, have, noticed, it, and, regarded, it, as, a, tactless, warning, of, immediate, death, to, us, all, and, one, likely, to, create, panic, several, survivors, who, were, among, the, last, to, leave, the, ship, including, brown, said, the, band, continued, playing, until, the, ship, began, her, final, plunge, gracie, said, that, the, band, stopped, playing, at, least, 30, minutes, before, the, vessel, sank, a, h, barkworth, a, first, class, passenger, said, i, do, not, wish, to, detract, from, the, bravery, of, anybody, but, i, might, mention, that, when, i, first, came, on, deck, the, band, was, playing, a, waltz, the, next, time, i, passed, where, the, band, was, stationed, the, members, had, thrown, down, their, instruments, and, were, not, to, be, seen, the, band, could, have, temporarily, stopped, playing, to, retrieve, their, lifebelts, then, resumed, bride, heard, the, band, playing, as, he, left, the, radio, cabin, which, was, by, now, awash, in, the, company, of, the, other, radio, operator, jack, phillips, he, had, fought, a, crewman, who, bride, thought, was, a, stoker, or, someone, from, below, decks, who, had, sneaked, into, the, radio, cabin, and, attempted, to, steal, phillips, s, lifebelt, bride, wrote, later, i, did, my, duty, i, hope, i, finished, i, don, t, know, we, left, him, on, the, cabin, floor, of, the, radio, room, and, he, was, not, moving, the, two, radio, operators, went, in, opposite, directions, phillips, aft, and, bride, forward, towards, collapsible, lifeboat, b, phillips, perished, gracie, was, also, heading, aft, but, as, he, made, his, way, towards, the, stern, he, found, his, path, blocked, by, a, mass, of, humanity, several, lines, deep, covering, the, boat, deck, facing, us, hundreds, of, steerage, passengers, who, had, finally, made, it, to, the, deck, just, as, the, last, lifeboats, departed, he, gave, up, on, the, idea, of, going, aft, and, jumped, into, the, water, to, get, away, from, the, crowd, at, about, 02, 15, titanic, s, angle, in, the, water, began, to, increase, rapidly, as, water, poured, into, previously, unflooded, parts, of, the, ship, through, deck, hatches, her, suddenly, increasing, angle, caused, what, one, survivor, called, a, giant, wave, to, wash, along, the, ship, from, the, forward, end, of, the, boat, deck, engulfing, many, people, the, parties, who, were, trying, to, launch, collapsible, boats, a, and, b, including, sixth, officer, moody, and, gracie, were, swept, away, along, with, the, two, boats, boat, b, floated, away, upside, down, with, bride, trapped, underneath, it, and, boat, a, ended, up, partly, flooded, and, with, its, canvas, not, raised, bride, and, gracie, survived, on, boat, b, but, moody, perished, lightoller, who, had, attempted, to, launch, collapsible, b, realised, it, would, be, futile, to, head, aft, and, dived, overboard, from, the, roof, of, the, officers, quarters, he, was, sucked, into, the, mouth, of, a, ventilation, shaft, but, was, blown, clear, by, a, terrific, blast, of, hot, air, and, emerged, next, to, the, capsized, lifeboat, the, forward, funnel, collapsed, under, its, own, weight, crushing, several, people, to, death, struggling, in, the, water, including, first, class, passenger, charles, duane, williams, as, it, fell, into, the, water, and, only, narrowly, missing, the, lifeboat, it, closely, missed, lightoller, and, created, a, wave, that, washed, the, boat, 50, yards, clear, of, the, sinking, ship, those, still, on, titanic, felt, her, structure, shuddering, as, it, underwent, immense, stresses, as, first, class, passenger, jack, thayer, described, it, occasionally, there, had, been, a, muffled, thud, or, deadened, explosion, within, the, ship, now, without, warning, she, seemed, to, start, forward, moving, forward, and, into, the, water, at, an, angle, of, about, fifteen, degrees, this, movement, with, the, water, rushing, up, toward, us, was, accompanied, by, a, rumbling, roar, mixed, with, more, muffled, explosions, it, was, like, standing, under, a, steel, railway, bridge, while, an, express, train, passes, overhead, mingled, with, the, noise, of, a, pressed, steel, factory, and, wholesale, breakage, of, china, eyewitnesses, saw, titanic, s, stern, rising, high, into, the, air, as, the, ship, tilted, down, in, the, water, it, was, said, to, have, reached, an, angle, of, 30, 45, degrees, revolving, apparently, around, a, centre, of, gravity, just, astern, of, midships, as, lawrence, beesley, later, put, it, many, survivors, described, a, great, noise, which, some, attributed, to, the, boilers, exploding, beesley, described, it, as, partly, a, groan, partly, a, rattle, and, partly, a, smash, and, it, was, not, a, sudden, roar, as, an, explosion, would, be, it, went, on, successively, for, some, seconds, possibly, fifteen, to, twenty, he, attributed, it, to, the, engines, and, machinery, coming, loose, from, their, bolts, and, bearings, and, falling, through, the, compartments, smashing, everything, in, their, way, after, another, minute, the, ship, s, lights, flickered, once, and, then, permanently, went, out, plunging, titanic, into, darkness, jack, thayer, recalled, seeing, groups, of, the, fifteen, hundred, people, still, aboard, clinging, in, clusters, or, bunches, like, swarming, bees, only, to, fall, in, masses, pairs, or, singly, as, the, great, afterpart, of, the, ship, two, hundred, fifty, feet, of, it, rose, into, the, sky, titanic, was, subjected, to, extreme, opposing, forces, the, flooded, bow, pulling, her, down, while, the, air, in, the, stern, kept, her, to, the, surface, which, were, concentrated, at, one, of, the, weakest, points, in, the, structure, the, area, of, the, engine, room, hatch, shortly, after, the, lights, went, out, the, ship, split, apart, the, submerged, bow, may, have, remained, attached, to, the, stern, by, the, keel, for, a, short, time, pulling, the, stern, to, a, high, angle, before, separating, and, leaving, the, stern, to, float, for, a, few, moments, longer, the, forward, part, of, the, stern, will, have, flooded, very, rapidly, causing, it, to, tilt, and, then, settle, briefly, until, sinking, the, ship, disappeared, from, view, at, 02, 20, 2, hours, and, 40, minutes, after, striking, the, iceberg, thayer, reported, that, it, rotated, on, the, surface, gradually, her, deck, away, from, us, as, though, to, hide, from, our, sight, the, awful, spectacle, then, with, the, deadened, noise, of, the, bursting, of, her, last, few, gallant, bulkheads, she, slid, quietly, away, from, us, into, the, sea, titanic, s, surviving, officers, and, some, prominent, survivors, testified, that, the, ship, had, sunk, in, one, piece, a, belief, that, was, affirmed, by, the, british, and, american, inquiries, into, the, disaster, archibald, gracie, who, was, on, the, promenade, deck, with, the, band, by, the, second, funnel, stated, that, titanic, s, decks, were, intact, at, the, time, she, sank, and, when, i, sank, with, her, there, was, over, seven, sixteenths, of, the, ship, already, underwater, and, there, was, no, indication, then, of, any, impending, break, of, the, deck, or, ship, ballard, argued, that, many, other, survivors, accounts, indicated, that, the, ship, had, broken, in, two, as, she, was, sinking, as, the, engines, are, now, known, to, have, stayed, in, place, along, with, most, of, the, boilers, the, great, noise, heard, by, witnesses, and, the, momentary, settling, of, the, stern, were, presumably, caused, by, the, break, up, of, the, ship, rather, than, the, loosening, of, her, fittings, or, boiler, explosions, there, are, two, main, theories, on, how, the, ship, broke, in, two, the, top, down, theory, and, the, mengot, theory, so, named, for, its, creator, roy, mengot, the, more, popular, top, down, theory, states, that, the, breakup, was, centralized, on, the, structural, weak, point, at, the, entrance, to, the, first, boiler, room, and, that, the, breakup, formed, first, at, the, upper, decks, before, shooting, down, to, the, keel, the, breakup, totally, separated, the, ship, up, to, the, double, bottom, which, acted, as, a, hinge, connecting, bow, and, stern, from, this, point, the, bow, was, able, to, pull, down, the, stern, until, the, double, bottom, failed, and, both, segments, of, the, ship, finally, separated, the, mengot, theory, postulates, that, the, ship, broke, from, compression, forces, and, not, fracture, tension, which, resulted, in, a, bottom, to, top, break, in, this, model, the, double, bottom, failed, first, and, was, forced, to, buckle, upwards, into, the, lower, decks, as, the, breakup, shot, up, to, the, upper, decks, the, ship, was, held, together, by, the, b, deck, which, featured, 6, large, doubler, plates, trapezoidal, steel, segments, meant, to, prevent, cracks, from, forming, in, the, smokestack, uptake, while, at, sea, which, acted, as, a, buffer, and, pushed, the, fractures, away, as, the, hull, s, contents, spilled, out, of, the, ship, b, deck, failed, and, caused, the, aft, tower, and, forward, tower, superstructures, to, detach, from, the, stern, as, the, bow, was, freed, and, sank, after, they, went, under, the, bow, and, stern, took, only, about, 5, 6, minutes, to, sink, 3, 795, metres, 12, 451, ft, spilling, a, trail, of, heavy, machinery, tons, of, coal, and, large, quantities, of, debris, from, titanic, s, interior, the, two, parts, of, the, ship, landed, about, 600, metres, 2, 000, ft, apart, on, a, gently, undulating, area, of, the, seabed, the, streamlined, bow, section, continued, to, descend, at, about, the, angle, it, had, taken, on, the, surface, striking, the, seabed, prow, first, at, a, shallow, angle, at, an, estimated, speed, of, 25, 30, mph, 40, 48, km, h, its, momentum, caused, it, to, dig, a, deep, gouge, into, the, seabed, and, buried, the, section, up, to, 20, metres, 66, ft, deep, in, sediment, before, it, came, to, an, abrupt, halt, the, sudden, deceleration, caused, the, bow, s, structure, to, buckle, downwards, by, several, degrees, just, forward, of, the, bridge, the, decks, at, the, rear, end, of, the, bow, section, which, had, already, been, weakened, during, the, break, up, collapsed, one, atop, another, the, stern, section, seems, to, have, descended, almost, vertically, probably, rotating, as, it, fell, empty, tanks, and, cofferdams, imploded, as, it, descended, tearing, open, the, structure, and, folding, back, the, steel, ribbing, of, the, poop, deck, the, section, landed, with, such, force, that, it, buried, itself, about, 15, metres, 49, ft, deep, at, the, rudder, the, decks, pancaked, down, on, top, of, each, other, and, the, hull, plating, splayed, out, to, the, sides, debris, continued, to, rain, down, across, the, seabed, for, several, hours, after, the, sinking, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, the, sinking, hundreds, of, people, were, left, struggling, in, the, icy, ocean, surrounded, by, debris, from, the, ship, titanic, s, disintegration, during, her, descent, to, the, seabed, caused, buoyant, chunks, of, debris, timber, beams, wooden, doors, furniture, panelling, and, chunks, of, cork, from, the, bulkheads, to, rocket, to, the, surface, these, injured, and, possibly, killed, some, of, the, swimmers, others, used, the, debris, to, try, to, keep, themselves, afloat, with, a, temperature, of, 2, c, 28, f, the, water, was, lethally, cold, lightoller, described, the, feeling, of, a, thousand, knives, being, driven, into, his, body, sudden, immersion, into, freezing, water, typically, causes, death, within, minutes, either, from, cardiac, arrest, uncontrollable, breathing, of, water, or, cold, shock, not, as, commonly, believed, from, hypothermia, almost, all, of, those, in, the, water, died, of, cardiac, arrest, or, other, bodily, reactions, to, freezing, water, within, 15, 30, minutes, only, 13, of, them, were, helped, into, the, lifeboats, even, though, these, had, room, for, almost, 500, more, people, those, in, the, lifeboats, were, horrified, to, hear, the, sound, of, what, lawrence, beesley, called, every, possible, emotion, of, human, fear, despair, agony, fierce, resentment, and, blind, anger, mingled, i, am, certain, of, those, with, notes, of, infinite, surprise, as, though, each, one, were, saying, how, is, it, possible, that, this, awful, thing, is, happening, to, me, that, i, should, be, caught, in, this, death, trap, jack, thayer, compared, it, to, the, sound, of, locusts, on, a, summer, night, while, george, rheims, who, jumped, moments, before, titanic, sank, described, it, as, a, dismal, moaning, sound, which, i, won, t, ever, forget, it, came, from, those, poor, people, who, were, floating, around, calling, for, help, it, was, horrifying, mysterious, supernatural, the, noise, of, the, people, in, the, water, screaming, yelling, and, crying, was, a, tremendous, shock, to, the, occupants, of, the, lifeboats, many, of, whom, had, up, to, that, moment, believed, that, everyone, had, escaped, before, the, ship, sank, as, beesley, later, wrote, the, cries, came, as, a, thunderbolt, unexpected, inconceivable, incredible, no, one, in, any, of, the, boats, standing, off, a, few, hundred, yards, away, can, have, escaped, the, paralysing, shock, of, knowing, that, so, short, a, distance, away, a, tragedy, unbelievable, in, its, magnitude, was, being, enacted, which, we, helpless, could, in, no, way, avert, or, diminish, only, a, few, of, those, in, the, water, survived, among, them, were, gracie, jack, thayer, and, lightoller, who, made, it, to, the, capsized, collapsible, boat, b, around, 12, crew, members, climbed, on, board, collapsible, b, and, they, rescued, those, they, could, until, some, 35, men, were, clinging, precariously, to, the, upturned, hull, realising, the, risk, to, the, boat, of, being, swamped, by, the, mass, of, swimmers, around, them, they, paddled, slowly, away, ignoring, the, pleas, of, dozens, of, swimmers, to, be, allowed, on, board, in, his, account, gracie, wrote, of, the, admiration, he, had, for, those, in, the, water, in, no, instance, i, am, happy, to, say, did, i, hear, any, word, of, rebuke, from, a, swimmer, because, of, a, refusal, to, grant, assistance, was, met, with, the, manly, voice, of, a, powerful, man, all, right, boys, good, luck, and, god, bless, you, gracie, said, he, heard, men, including, stoker, harry, senior, and, entree, cook, isaac, maynard, on, collapsible, b, say, that, captain, smith, was, in, the, water, near, the, boat, fireman, walter, hurst, said, he, thought, the, man, who, cried, out, all, right, boys, good, luck, and, god, bless, you, was, smith, hurst, said, the, man, cheered, the, occupants, on, saying, good, boys, good, lads, with, the, voice, of, authority, hurst, deeply, moved, by, the, swimmer, s, valor, reached, out, to, him, with, an, oar, but, the, man, was, dead, several, other, swimmers, reached, collapsible, boat, a, which, was, upright, but, partly, flooded, as, its, sides, had, not, been, properly, raised, its, occupants, had, to, sit, for, hours, in, a, foot, of, freezing, water, and, many, died, of, hypothermia, during, the, night, farther, out, the, other, eighteen, lifeboats, most, of, which, had, empty, seats, drifted, as, the, occupants, debated, what, if, anything, they, should, do, to, rescue, the, swimmers, boat, no, 4, having, remained, near, the, sinking, ship, seems, to, have, been, closest, to, the, site, of, the, sinking, at, around, 50, metres, 160, ft, away, this, had, enabled, two, people, to, drop, into, the, boat, and, another, to, be, picked, up, from, the, water, before, the, ship, sank, after, the, sinking, seven, more, men, were, pulled, from, the, water, although, two, later, died, collapsible, d, rescued, one, male, passenger, who, jumped, in, the, water, and, swam, over, to, the, boat, immediately, after, it, had, been, lowered, in, all, the, other, boats, the, occupants, eventually, decided, against, returning, probably, out, of, fear, that, they, would, be, capsized, in, the, attempt, some, put, their, objections, bluntly, quartermaster, hichens, commanding, lifeboat, no, 6, told, the, women, aboard, his, boat, that, there, was, no, point, returning, as, there, were, only, a, lot, of, stiffs, there, after, about, twenty, minutes, the, cries, began, to, fade, as, the, swimmers, lapsed, into, unconsciousness, and, death, fifth, officer, lowe, in, charge, of, lifeboat, no, 14, waited, until, the, yells, and, shrieks, had, subsided, for, the, people, to, thin, out, before, mounting, an, attempt, to, rescue, those, in, the, water, he, gathered, together, five, of, the, lifeboats, and, transferred, the, occupants, between, them, to, free, up, space, in, no, 14, lowe, then, took, a, crew, of, seven, crewmen, and, one, male, passenger, who, volunteered, to, help, and, then, rowed, back, to, the, site, of, the, sinking, the, whole, operation, took, about, three, quarters, of, an, hour, by, the, time, no, 14, headed, back, to, the, site, of, the, sinking, almost, all, of, those, in, the, water, were, dead, and, only, a, few, voices, could, still, be, heard, lucy, lady, duff, gordon, recalled, after, the, disaster, that, the, very, last, cry, was, that, of, a, man, who, had, been, calling, loudly, my, god, my, god, he, cried, monotonously, in, a, dull, hopeless, way, for, an, entire, hour, there, had, been, an, awful, chorus, of, shrieks, gradually, dying, into, a, hopeless, moan, until, this, last, cry, that, i, speak, of, then, all, was, silent, for, some, survivors, the, dead, silence, that, followed, was, worse, even, than, the, cries, for, help, lowe, and, his, crew, found, four, men, still, alive, one, of, whom, died, shortly, afterwards, otherwise, all, they, could, see, were, hundreds, of, bodies, and, lifebelts, the, dead, seemed, as, if, they, had, perished, with, the, cold, as, their, limbs, were, all, cramped, up, in, the, other, boats, there, was, nothing, the, survivors, could, do, but, await, the, arrival, of, rescue, ships, the, air, was, bitterly, cold, and, several, of, the, boats, had, taken, on, water, the, survivors, could, not, find, any, food, or, drinkable, water, in, the, boats, and, most, had, no, lights, the, situation, was, particularly, bad, aboard, collapsible, b, which, was, only, kept, afloat, by, a, diminishing, air, pocket, in, the, upturned, hull, as, dawn, approached, the, wind, rose, and, the, sea, became, increasingly, choppy, forcing, those, on, the, collapsible, boat, to, stand, up, to, balance, it, some, exhausted, by, the, ordeal, fell, into, the, sea, and, drowned, it, became, steadily, more, difficult, for, the, rest, to, keep, their, balance, on, the, hull, with, waves, washing, across, it, archibald, gracie, later, wrote, of, how, he, and, the, other, survivors, sitting, on, the, upturned, hull, were, struck, by, the, utter, helplessness, of, our, position, titanic, s, survivors, were, rescued, around, 04, 00, on, 15, april, by, the, rms, carpathia, which, had, steamed, through, the, night, at, high, speed, and, at, considerable, risk, as, the, ship, had, to, dodge, numerous, icebergs, en, route, carpathia, s, lights, were, first, spotted, around, 03, 30, which, greatly, cheered, the, survivors, though, it, took, several, more, hours, for, everyone, to, be, brought, aboard, the, 30, or, more, men, on, collapsible, b, finally, managed, to, board, two, other, lifeboats, but, one, survivor, died, just, before, the, transfer, was, made, collapsible, a, was, also, in, trouble, and, was, now, nearly, awash, many, of, those, aboard, maybe, more, than, half, had, died, overnight, the, remaining, survivors, were, transferred, from, a, into, another, lifeboat, leaving, behind, three, bodies, in, the, boat, which, was, left, to, drift, away, it, was, recovered, a, month, later, by, the, white, star, liner, rms, oceanic, with, the, bodies, still, aboard, those, on, carpathia, were, startled, by, the, scene, that, greeted, them, as, the, sun, rose, fields, of, ice, on, which, like, points, on, the, landscape, rested, innumerable, pyramids, of, ice, captain, arthur, rostron, of, carpathia, saw, ice, all, around, including, 20, large, bergs, measuring, up, to, 200, feet, 61, m, high, and, numerous, smaller, bergs, as, well, as, ice, floes, and, debris, from, titanic, it, appeared, to, carpathia, s, passengers, that, their, ship, was, in, the, middle, of, a, vast, white, plain, of, ice, studded, with, icebergs, appearing, like, hills, in, the, distance, as, the, lifeboats, were, brought, alongside, carpathia, the, survivors, came, aboard, the, ship, by, various, means, some, were, strong, enough, to, climb, up, rope, ladders, others, were, hoisted, up, in, slings, and, the, children, were, hoisted, in, mail, sacks, the, last, lifeboat, to, reach, the, ship, was, lightoller, s, boat, no, 12, with, 74, people, aboard, a, boat, designed, to, carry, 65, they, were, all, on, carpathia, by, 09, 00, there, were, some, scenes, of, joy, as, families, and, friends, were, reunited, but, in, most, cases, hopes, died, as, loved, ones, failed, to, reappear, at, 09, 15, two, more, ships, arrived, mount, temple, and, californian, which, had, finally, learned, of, the, disaster, when, her, radio, operator, returned, to, duty, but, by, then, there, were, no, more, survivors, to, rescue, carpathia, had, been, bound, for, fiume, austria, hungary, now, rijeka, croatia, but, as, she, had, neither, the, stores, nor, the, medical, facilities, to, cater, for, the, survivors, rostron, ordered, that, a, course, be, calculated, to, return, to, new, york, where, the, survivors, could, be, properly, looked, after, carpathia, departed, the, area, leaving, the, other, ships, to, carry, out, a, final, fruitless, two, hour, search, when, carpathia, arrived, at, pier, 54, in, new, york, on, the, evening, of, 18, april, after, a, difficult, voyage, through, pack, ice, fog, thunderstorms, and, rough, seas, some, 40, 000, people, were, standing, on, the, wharves, alerted, to, the, disaster, by, a, stream, of, radio, messages, from, carpathia, and, other, ships, it, was, only, after, carpathia, docked, three, days, after, titanic, s, sinking, that, the, full, scope, of, the, disaster, became, public, knowledge, even, before, carpathia, arrived, in, new, york, efforts, were, getting, underway, to, retrieve, the, dead, four, ships, chartered, by, the, white, star, line, succeeded, in, retrieving, 328, bodies, 119, were, buried, at, sea, while, the, remaining, 209, were, brought, ashore, to, the, canadian, port, of, halifax, nova, scotia, where, 150, of, them, were, buried, memorials, were, raised, in, various, places, new, york, washington, southampton, liverpool, belfast, and, lichfield, among, others, and, ceremonies, were, held, on, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, to, commemorate, the, dead, and, raise, funds, to, aid, the, survivors, the, bodies, of, most, of, titanic, s, victims, were, never, recovered, and, the, only, evidence, of, their, deaths, was, found, 73, years, later, among, the, debris, on, the, seabed, pairs, of, shoes, lying, side, by, side, where, bodies, had, once, lain, before, eventually, decomposing, the, prevailing, public, reaction, to, the, disaster, was, one, of, shock, and, outrage, directed, against, several, issues, and, people, why, were, there, so, few, lifeboats, why, had, ismay, saved, his, own, life, when, so, many, others, died, why, did, titanic, proceed, into, the, ice, field, at, full, speed, the, outrage, was, driven, not, least, by, the, survivors, themselves, even, while, they, were, aboard, carpathia, on, their, way, to, new, york, beesley, and, other, survivors, determined, to, awaken, public, opinion, to, safeguard, ocean, travel, in, the, future, and, wrote, a, public, letter, to, the, times, urging, changes, to, maritime, safety, laws, in, places, closely, associated, with, titanic, the, sense, of, grief, was, deep, the, heaviest, losses, were, in, southampton, home, port, to, 699, crew, members, and, also, home, to, many, of, the, passengers, crowds, of, weeping, women, the, wives, sisters, and, mothers, of, crew, gathered, outside, the, white, star, offices, in, southampton, for, news, of, their, loved, ones, most, of, them, were, among, the, 549, southampton, residents, who, perished, in, belfast, churches, were, packed, and, shipyard, workers, wept, in, the, streets, the, ship, had, been, a, symbol, of, belfast, s, industrial, achievements, and, there, was, not, only, a, sense, of, grief, but, also, one, of, guilt, as, those, who, had, built, titanic, came, to, feel, they, had, been, responsible, in, some, way, for, her, loss, in, liverpool, the, homebase, of, the, white, star, line, representatives, of, the, company, were, confronted, with, such, public, anger, that, they, were, forced, to, announce, the, list, of, casualties, from, the, balcony, of, the, company, headquarters, in, the, aftermath, of, the, sinking, public, inquiries, were, set, up, in, the, united, kingdom, and, united, states, the, us, inquiry, began, on, 19, april, under, the, chairmanship, of, senator, william, alden, smith, and, the, british, inquiry, commenced, in, london, under, lord, mersey, on, 2, may, 1912, they, reached, broadly, similar, conclusions, the, regulations, on, the, number, of, lifeboats, that, ships, had, to, carry, were, out, of, date, and, inadequate, captain, smith, had, failed, to, take, proper, heed, of, ice, warnings, the, lifeboats, had, not, been, properly, filled, or, crewed, and, the, collision, was, the, direct, result, of, steaming, into, a, danger, area, at, too, high, a, speed, both, inquiries, strongly, criticised, captain, lord, of, californian, for, failing, to, render, assistance, to, titanic, neither, inquiry, found, negligence, by, the, parent, company, international, mercantile, marine, co, or, the, white, star, line, which, owned, titanic, the, us, inquiry, concluded, that, those, involved, had, followed, standard, practice, and, the, disaster, could, thus, only, be, categorised, as, an, act, of, god, the, british, inquiry, concluded, that, smith, had, followed, long, standing, practice, which, had, not, previously, been, shown, to, be, unsafe, noting, that, british, ships, alone, had, carried, 3, 5, million, passengers, over, the, previous, decade, with, the, loss, of, just, 73, lives, and, concluded, that, he, had, done, only, that, which, other, skilled, men, would, have, done, in, the, same, position, the, british, inquiry, also, warned, that, what, was, a, mistake, in, the, case, of, the, titanic, would, without, doubt, be, negligence, in, any, similar, case, in, the, future, the, disaster, led, to, major, changes, in, maritime, regulations, to, implement, new, safety, measures, such, as, ensuring, that, more, lifeboats, were, provided, that, lifeboat, drills, were, properly, carried, out, and, that, radio, equipment, on, passenger, ships, was, manned, around, the, clock, radio, operators, were, to, give, priority, to, emergency, and, hazard, messages, over, private, messages, and, to, use, the, q, code, to, minimize, language, problems, shore, stations, of, the, rival, international, wireless, networks, the, british, marconi, company, and, telefunken, of, germany, were, required, to, handle, all, radio, calls, including, those, of, the, other, network, an, international, ice, patrol, was, set, up, to, monitor, the, presence, of, icebergs, in, the, north, atlantic, and, maritime, safety, regulations, were, harmonised, internationally, through, the, international, convention, for, the, safety, of, life, at, sea, solas, titanic, s, sinking, has, become, a, cultural, phenomenon, commemorated, by, artists, film, makers, writers, composers, musicians, and, dancers, from, the, time, immediately, after, the, sinking, to, the, present, day, on, 1, september, 1985, a, joint, us, french, expedition, led, by, robert, ballard, found, the, wreck, of, titanic, and, the, ship, s, rediscovery, led, to, an, explosion, of, interest, in, titanic, s, story, numerous, expeditions, have, been, launched, to, film, the, wreck, and, controversially, to, salvage, objects, from, the, debris, field, the, first, major, exhibition, of, recovered, artefacts, was, held, at, london, s, national, maritime, museum, in, 1994, 95, the, disaster, inspired, numerous, films, in, 1997, james, cameron, s, film, titanic, became, the, first, film, ever, to, take, 1, billion, at, the, box, office, the, second, film, to, win, 11, academy, awards, including, best, picture, after, ben, hur, 1959, and, the, film, s, soundtrack, became, the, best, selling, soundtrack, recording, of, all, time, the, wreck, is, steadily, decaying, with, an, estimated, 0, 5, 1, ton, of, metal, turning, to, oxide, per, day, assuming, one, ten, thousandth, of, an, inch, per, day, on, all, surfaces, eventually, titanic, s, structure, will, collapse, and, she, will, be, reduced, to, a, patch, of, rust, on, the, seabed, with, any, remaining, scraps, of, the, ship, s, hull, mingled, with, her, more, durable, fittings, like, the, propellers, bronze, capstans, compasses, and, the, telemotor, the, number, of, casualties, of, the, sinking, is, unclear, due, to, several, factors, including, confusion, over, the, passenger, list, which, included, some, names, of, people, who, cancelled, their, trip, at, the, last, minute, and, the, fact, that, several, passengers, travelled, under, aliases, for, various, reasons, and, were, double, counted, on, the, casualty, lists, the, death, toll, has, been, put, at, between, 1, 490, and, 1, 635, people, the, figures, below, are, from, the, british, board, of, trade, report, on, the, disaster, less, than, a, third, of, those, aboard, titanic, survived, the, disaster, some, survivors, died, shortly, afterwards, injuries, and, the, effects, of, exposure, caused, the, deaths, of, several, of, those, brought, aboard, carpathia, of, the, groups, shown, in, the, table, 49, per, cent, of, the, children, 26, per, cent, of, the, female, passengers, 82, per, cent, of, the, male, passengers, and, 78, per, cent, of, the, crew, died, the, figures, show, stark, differences, in, the, survival, rates, between, men, and, women, and, of, the, different, classes, aboard, titanic, especially, among, women, and, children, although, less, than, 10, per, cent, of, first, and, second, class, women, combined, were, lost, 54, per, cent, of, those, in, third, class, died, similarly, five, of, six, first, class, and, all, second, class, children, survived, but, 52, of, the, 79, in, third, class, perished, the, only, first, class, child, to, perish, was, loraine, allison, aged, two, proportionately, the, heaviest, losses, were, suffered, by, the, second, class, men, of, whom, 92, per, cent, died, of, the, pets, brought, aboard, three, survived, the, sinking
