in, authority, and, grandeur, by, anawrahta, s, accession, in, 1044, pagan, had, grown, into, a, small, principality, about, 320, kilometres, 200, mi, north, to, south, and, about, 130, kilometres, 81, mi, from, east, to, west, comprising, roughly, the, present, districts, of, mandalay, meiktila, myingyan, kyaukse, yamethin, magwe, sagaing, and, the, riverine, portions, of, minbu, and, pakkoku,

ledwin, lit, rice, country, became, the, granary, the, economic, key, of, the, north, country, history, shows, that, one, who, gained, control, of, kyaukse, became, kingmaker, in, upper, myanmar, by, the, mid, 1050s, anawrahta, s, reforms, had, turned, pagan, into, a, regional, power, and, he, looked, to, expand, over, the, next, ten, years, he, founded, the, pagan, empire, the, irrawaddy, valley, at, the, core, surrounded, by, tributary, states, anawrahta, began, his, campaigns, in, the, nearer, shan, hills, and, extended, conquests, to, lower, myanmar, down, to, the, tenasserim, coast, to, phuket, and, north, arakan, estimates, of, the, extent, of, his, empire, vary, greatly, the, burmese, and, siamese, chronicles, report, an, empire, which, covered, the, present, day, myanmar, and, northern, thailand, the, siamese, chronicles, assert, that, anawrahta, conquered, the, entire, menam, valley, and, received, tribute, from, the, khmer, king, one, siamese, chronicle, states, that, anawrahta, s, armies, invaded, the, khmer, kingdom, and, sacked, the, city, of, angkor, and, another, one, goes, so, far, as, to, say, that, anawrahta, even, visited, java, to, receive, his, tribute, archaeological, evidence, however, confirms, only, a, smaller, empire, of, the, irrawaddy, valley, and, nearer, periphery, anawrahta, s, victory, terracotta, votive, tablets, emblazoned, with, his, name, in, sanskrit, have, been, found, along, the, tenasserim, coastline, in, the, south, katha, in, the, north, thazi, in, the, east, and, minbu, in, the, west, in, the, northeast, a, series, of, 43, forts, anawrahta, established, along, the, eastern, foothills, of, which, 33, still, exist, as, villages, reveal, the, effective, extent, of, his, authority, moreover, most, scholars, attribute, pagan, s, control, of, peripheral, regions, arakan, shan, hills, to, later, kings, arakan, to, alaungsithu, and, cis, salween, shan, hills, to, narapatisithu, even, those, latter, day, kings, may, not, have, had, more, than, nominal, control, over, the, farther, peripheral, regions, for, example, some, scholars, such, as, victor, lieberman, argue, that, pagan, did, not, have, any, effective, authority, over, arakan, at, any, rate, all, scholars, accept, that, during, the, 11th, century, pagan, consolidated, its, hold, of, upper, burma, and, established, its, authority, over, lower, burma, the, emergence, of, pagan, empire, would, have, a, lasting, impact, on, burmese, history, as, well, as, the, history, of, mainland, southeast, asia, the, conquest, of, lower, burma, checked, the,

buddhism, the, burmese, king, provided, the, buddhist, school, which, had, been, in, retreat, elsewhere, in, south, asia, and, southeast, asia, a, much, needed, reprieve, and, a, safe, shelter, by, the, 1070s, pagan, had, emerged, as, the, main, theravada, stronghold, in, 1071, it, helped, to, restart, the, theravada, buddhism, in, ceylon, whose, buddhist, clergy, had, been, wiped, out, by, the, cholas, another, key, development, according, to, traditional, scholarship, was, the, creation, of, the, burmese, alphabet, from, the, mon, script, in, 1058, one, year, after, the, conquest, of, thaton, anawrahta, was, followed, by, a, line, of, able, kings, who, cemented, pagan, s, place, in, history, pagan, entered, a, golden, age, that, would, last, for, the, next, two, centuries, aside, from, a, few, occasional, rebellions, the, kingdom, was, largely, peaceful, during, the, period, king, kyansittha, r, 1084, 1112, successfully, melded, the, diverse, cultural, influences, introduced, into, pagan, by, anawrahta, s, conquests, he, patronised, mon, scholars, and, artisans, who, emerged, as, the, intellectual, elite, he, appeased, the, pyus, by, linking, his, genealogy, to, the, real, and, mythical, ancestors, of, sri, ksetra, the, symbol, of, the, pyu, golden, past, and, by, calling, the, kingdom, pyu, even, though, it, had, been, ruled, by, a, burman, ruling, class, he, supported, and, favoured, theravada, buddhism, while, tolerating, other, religious, groups, to, be, sure, he, pursued, these, policies, all, the, while, maintaining, the, burman, military, rule, by, the, end, of, his, 28, year, reign, pagan, had, emerged, a, major, power, alongside, the, khmer, empire, in, southeast, asia, recognised, as, a, sovereign, kingdom, by, the, chinese, song, dynasty,

irrigation, systems, throughout, the, kingdom, he, also, introduced, standardised, weights, and, measures, throughout, the, country, to, assist, administration, as, well, as, trade, the, standardisation, provided, an, impetus, for, the, monetisation, of, pagan, s, economy, the, full, impact, of, which, however, would, not, be, felt, until, later, in, the, 12th, century, the, kingdom, prospered, from, increased, agricultural, output, as, well, as, from, inland, and, maritime, trading, networks, much, of, the, wealth, was, devoted, to, temple, building, temple, building, projects,

the, practice, of, donating, tax, free, land, to, religion, had, not, the, continuous, growth, of, tax, free, religious, wealth, greatly, reduced, the, tax, base, of, the, kingdom, indeed, htilominlo, was, the, last, of, the, temple, builders, although, most, of, his, temples, were, in, remote, lands, not, in, the, pagan, region, reflecting, the, deteriorating, state, of, royal, treasury, by, the, mid, 13th, century, the, problem, had, worsened, considerably, the, upper, myanmar, heartland, over, which, pagan, exercised, most, political, control, had, run, out, of, easily, reclaimed, irrigable, tracts, yet, their, fervent, desire, to, accumulate, religious, merit, for, better, reincarnations, made, it, impossible, for, pagan, kings, to, halt, entirely, their, own, or, other, courtiers,

although, some, of, the, reclamation, efforts, were, successful, powerful, buddhist, clergy, by, and, large, successfully, resisted, such, attempts, ultimately, the, rate, of, reclamation, fell, behind, the, rate, at, which, such, lands, were, dedicated, to, the, sangha, the, problem, was, exacerbated, to, a, smaller, degree, by, powerful, ministers, who, exploited, succession, disputes, and, accumulated, their, own, lands, at, the, expense, of, the, crown, by, 1280, between, one, and, two, thirds, of, upper, myanmar, s, cultivatable, land, had, been, donated, to, religion, thus, the,

too, was, put, down, the, calm, did, not, last, long, martaban, again, revolted, in, 1285, this, time, pagan, could, not, do, anything, to, retake, martaban, because, it, was, facing, an, existential, threat, from, the, north, the, mongols, of, the, yuan, dynasty, demanded, tribute, in, 1271, and, again, in, 1273, when, narathihapate, refused, both, times, the, mongols, under, kublai, khan, systematically, invaded, the, country, the, first, invasion, in, 1277, defeated, the, burmese, at, the, battle, of, ngasaunggyan, and, secured, their, hold, of, kanngai, modern, day, yingjiang,

for, lower, myanmar, where, he, was, assassinated, by, one, of, his, sons, in, 1287, the, mongols, invaded, again, in, 1287, recent, research, indicates, that, mongol, armies, may, not, have, reached, pagan, itself, and, that, even, if, they, did, the, damage, they, inflicted, was, probably, minimal, but, the, damage, was, already, done, all, the, vassal, states, of, pagan, revolted, right, after, the, king, s, death, and, went, their, own, way, in, the, south, wareru, the, man, who, had, seized, the, governorship, of, martaban, in, 1285, consolidated, mon, speaking, regions, of, lower,

they, had, created, farther, south, indeed, emperor, kublai, khan, never, sanctioned, an, actual, occupation, of, pagan, his, real, aim, appeared, to, have, been, to, keep, the, entire, region, of, southeast, asia, broken, and, fragmented, at, pagan, one, of, narathihapate, s, sons, kyawswa, emerged, as, king, of, pagan, in, may, 1289, but, the, new, king, controlled, just, a, small, area, around, the, capital, and, had, no, real, army, the, real, power, in, upper, myanmar, now, rested, with, three, brothers, who, were, former, pagan, commanders, of, nearby, myinsaing, when, the, hanthawaddy, kingdom, of, lower, myanmar, became, a, vassal, of, sukhothai, in, 1293, 94, it, was, the, brothers, not, kyawswa, that, sent, a, force, to, reclaim, the, former, pagan, territory, in, 1295, 96, though, the, army, was, driven, back, it, left, no, doubt, as, to, who, held, the, real, power, in, central, myanmar, in, the, following, years, the, brothers, especially, the, youngest,

mongol, emperor, tem, r, khan, as, viceroy, of, pagan, on, 20, march, 1297, the, brothers, resented, the, new, arrangement, as, a, mongol, vassalage, as, it, directly, reduced, their, power, on, 17, december, 1297, the, three, brothers, overthrew, kyawswa, and, founded, the, myinsaing, kingdom, the, mongols, did, not, know, about, the, dethronement, until, june, july, 1298, in, response, the, mongols, launched, another, invasion, reaching, myinsaing, on, 25, january, 1301, but, could, not, break, through, the, besiegers, took, the, bribes, of, the, three, brothers, and, withdrew, on, 6,

officials, in, the, early, 13th, century, c, 1211, part, of, the, court, evolved, into, the, king, s, privy, council, or, hluttaw, the, role, and, power, of, the, hluttaw, grew, greatly, in, the, following, decades, it, came, to, manage, not, only, day, to, day, affairs, but, also, military, affairs, of, the, kingdom, no, pagan, king, after, sithu, ii, ever, took, command, of, the, army, again, the, powerful, ministers, also, became, kingmakers, their, support, was, an, important, factor, in, the, accession, of, the, last, kings, of, pagan, from, htilominlo, r, 1211, 1235, to, kyawswa, r, 1289, 1297, the, court, was, also, the, chief, justice, of, the, land, sithu, i, r, 1112, 1167, was, the, first, pagan, king, to, issue, an, official, collection, of, judgments, later, known, as, the, alaungsithu, hpyat, hton, to, be, followed, as, precedents, by, all, courts, of, justice, a, follow, up, collection, of, judgments, was, compiled, during, the, reign, of, sithu, ii, r, 1174, 1211, by, a, mon, monk, named, dhammavilasa, as, another, sign, of, delegation, of, power, sithu, ii, also, appointed, a, chief, justice, and, a, chief, minister, pagan, s, military, was, the, origin, of, the, royal, burmese, army, the, army, was, organised, into, a, small, standing, army, of, a, few, thousand, which, defended, the, capital, and, the, palace, and, a, much, larger, conscript, based, wartime, army, conscription, was, based, on, the, kyundaw, system, called, the, ahmudan, system, by, later, dynasties, which, required, local, chiefs, to, supply, their, predetermined, quota, of, men, from, their, jurisdiction, on, the, basis, of, population, in, times, of, war, this, basic, system, of, military, organisation, was, largely, unchanged, down, to, the, precolonial, period, although, later, dynasties, especially, the, toungoo, dynasty, did, introduce, standardisation, and, other, modifications, the, early, pagan, army, consisted, mainly, of, conscripts, raised, just, prior, to, or, during, the, times, of, war, although, historians, believe, that, earlier, kings, like, anawrahta, must, have, had, permanent, troops, on, duty, in, the, palace, the, first, specific, mention, of, a, standing, military, structure, in, the, burmese, chronicles, is, 1174, when, sithu, ii, founded, the, palace, guards, two, companies, inner, and, outer, and, they, kept, watch, in, ranks, one, behind, the, other, the, palace, guards, became, the, nucleus, round, which, the, mass, levy, assembled, in, war, time, most, of, the, field, levy, served, in, the, infantry, but, the, men, for, the, elephantry, cavalry, and, naval, corps, were, drawn, from, specific, hereditary, villages, that, specialised, in, respective, military, skills, in, an, era, of, limited, military, specialisation, when, the, number, of, conscripted, cultivators, offered, the, best, single, indication, of, military, success, upper, myanmar, with, a, greater, population, was, the, natural, centre, of, political, gravity, various, sources, and, estimates, put, pagan, s, military, strength, anywhere, between, 30, 000, and, 60, 000, men, one, inscription, by, sithu, ii, who, expanded, the, empire, to, its, greatest, extent, describes, him, as, the, lord, of, 17, 645, soldiers, while, another, notes, 30, 000, soldiers, and, cavalry, under, his, command, a, chinese, account, mentions, a, burmese, army, of, 40, 000, to, 60, 000, including, 800, elephants, and, 10, 000, horses, at, the, battle, of, ngasaunggyan, in, 1277, however, some, argue, that, the, chinese, figures, which, came, from, eye, estimates, of, a, single, battle, are, greatly, exaggerated, as, harvey, puts, it, the, mongols, erred, on, the, side, of, generosity, as, they, did, not, wish, to, diminish, the, glory, in, defeating, superior, numbers, but, assuming, that, the, precolonial, population, of, myanmar, was, relatively, constant, the, estimates, of, 40, 000, to, 60, 000, of, the, entire, military, are, not, improbable, and, are, in, line, with, figures, given, for, the, burmese, military, between, the, 16th, and, 19th, centuries, in, a, variety, of, sources, the, economy, of, pagan, was, based, primarily, on, agriculture, and, to, a, much, smaller, degree, on, trade, the, growth, of, the, pagan, empire, and, subsequent, development, of, irrigated, lands, in, new, lands, sustained, a, growth, in, the, number, of, population, centres, and, a, growing, prosperous, economy, the, economy, also, benefited, from, the, general, absence, of, warfare, that, would, stunt, the, economies, of, later, dynasties, according, to, victor, lieberman, the, prosperous, economy, supported, a, rich, buddhist, civilization, whose, most, spectacular, feature, was, a, dense, forest, of, pagodas, monasteries, and, temples, totaling, perhaps, 10, 000, brick, structures, of, which, the, remains, of, over, 2000, survive, agriculture, was, the, primary, engine, of, the, kingdom, from, its, beginnings, in, the, 9th, century, burman, immigrants, are, believed, to, have, either, introduced, new, water, management, techniques, or, greatly, enhanced, existing, pyu, system, of, weirs, dams, sluices, and, diversionary, barricades, at, any, rate, the, kyaukse, agricultural, basin, s, development, in, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, enabled, the, kingdom, of, pagan, to, expand, beyond, the, dry, zone, of, upper, myanmar, and, to, dominate, its, periphery, including, the, maritime, lower, myanmar, as, reconstructed, by, michael, aung, thwin, g, h, luce, and, than, tun, the, main, driver, for, this, agriculture, based, economic, expansion, was, the, practice, of, donating, tax, free, lands, to, the, buddhist, clergy, for, some, two, hundred, years, between, 1050, and, 1250, wealthy, and, powerful, segments, of, the, pagan, society, members, of, the, royalty, senior, court, officials, and, wealthy, laymen, donated, to, the, clergy, enormous, acreages, of, agricultural, land, along, with, hereditary, tied, cultivators, to, attain, religious, merit, both, religious, lands, and, cultivators, were, permanently, tax, exempt, although, it, ultimately, became, a, major, burden, on, the, economy, the, practice, initially, helped, expand, the, economy, for, some, two, centuries, first, the, monastery, temple, complexes, typically, located, some, distances, away, from, the, capital, helped, anchor, new, population, centres, for, the, throne, such, institutions, in, turn, stimulated, associated, artisan, commercial, and, agricultural, activities, critical, to, the, general, economy, secondly, the, need, to, accumulate, land, for, endowments, as, well, as, for, awards, for, soldiers, and, servicemen, drove, the, active, development, of, new, lands, the, earliest, irrigation, projects, focused, on, kyaukse, where, burmans, built, a, large, number, of, new, weirs, and, diversionary, canals, and, minbu, a, similarly, well, watered, district, south, of, pagan, after, these, hubs, had, been, developed, in, the, mid, to, late, 12th, century, pagan, moved, into, as, yet, undeveloped, frontier, areas, west, of, the, irrawaddy, and, south, of, minbu, these, new, lands, included, both, irrigable, wet, rice, areas, and, non, irrigable, areas, suitable, for, rain, fed, rice, pulses, sesame, and, millet, agricultural, expansion, and, temple, construction, in, turn, sustained, a, market, in, land, and, certain, types, of, labour, and, materials, land, reclamation, religious, donations, and, building, projects, expanded, slowly, before, 1050, increased, to, 1100, accelerated, sharply, with, the, opening, of, new, lands, between, c, 1140, and, c, 1210, and, continued, at, a, lower, level, from, 1220, to, 1300, by, the, second, half, of, the, 13th, century, pagan, had, developed, an, enormous, amount, of, cultivated, lands, estimates, based, on, surviving, inscriptions, alone, range, from, 200, 000, to, 250, 000, hectares, in, comparison, pagan, s, contemporary, angkor, relied, on, its, main, rice, basin, of, over, 13, 000, hectares, but, donations, to, the, sangha, over, the, 250, years, of, the, empire, accumulated, to, over, 150, 000, hectares, over, 60, of, the, total, cultivated, land, ultimately, the, practice, proved, unsustainable, when, the, empire, had, stopped, growing, physically, and, a, major, factor, in, the, empire, s, downfall, internal, and, external, trade, played, an, important, but, minor, role, in, pagan, s, economy, trade, was, not, the, main, engine, of, economic, growth, for, much, of, the, pagan, period, although, its, share, of, the, economy, probably, increased, in, the, 13th, century, when, the, agricultural, sector, stopped, growing, that, is, not, to, say, that, pagan, did, not, have, any, interest, in, trade, on, the, contrary, pagan, closely, administered, its, peninsular, ports, which, were, transit, points, between, the, indian, ocean, and, china, maritime, trade, provided, the, court, with, revenues, and, prestige, goods, coral, pearls, textiles, evidence, shows, that, pagan, imported, silver, from, yunnan, and, that, traded, upland, forest, products, gems, and, perhaps, metals, with, the, coast, still, no, archaeological, textual, or, inscriptional, evidence, to, indicate, that, such, exports, supported, large, numbers, of, producers, or, middlemen, in, upper, myanmar, itself, or, that, trade, constituted, a, large, part, of, the, economy, for, all, the, innovations, that, the, pagan, dynasty, introduced, one, area, that, it, regressed, was, the, use, of, coinage, the, pyu, practice, of, issuing, gold, and, silver, coinage, was, not, retained, the, common, medium, of, exchange, was, lump, silver, coinage, followed, by, gold, and, copper, lump,

emerged, to, be, sure, the, notion, of, ethnicity, in, pre, colonial, burma, was, highly, fluid, heavily, influenced, by, language, culture, class, locale, and, indeed, political, power, people, changed, their, in, group, identification, depending, on, the, social, context, the, success, and, longevity, of, the, pagan, empire, sustained, the, spread, of, burman, ethnicity, and, culture, in, upper, burma, in, a, process, that, came, to, be, called, burmanization, which, lieberman, describes, as, assimilation, by, bi, lingual, peoples, eager, to, identify, with, the, imperial, elite, according, to, lieberman, pagan, s, imperial, power, enabled, the, construction, of, burman, cultural, hegemony, evidenced, by, the, growth, of, burmese, writing, the, concomitant, decline, in, pyu, and, perhaps, mon, culture, new, trends, in, art, and, architecture, and, the, expansion, of, burmese, speaking, cultivators, into, new, lands, nonetheless, by, the, end, of, pagan, period, the, process, of, burmanization, which, would, continue, into, the, 19th, century, and, eventually, blanket, the, entire, lowlands, was, still, in, an, early, stage, the, first, extant, burmese, language, reference, to, burmans, appeared, only, in, 1190, and, the, first, reference, to, upper, burma, as, the, land, of, the, burmans, myanma, pyay, in, 1235, the, notion, of, ethnicity, continued, to, be, highly, fluid, and, closely, tied, to, political, power, while, the, rise, of, ava, ensured, the, continued, spread, of, burman, ethnicity, in, post, pagan, upper, burma, the, similar, emergence, of, non, burmese, speaking, kingdoms, elsewhere, helped, develop, ethnic, consciousness, closely, tied, to, respective, ruling, classes, in, lower, burma, shan, states, and, arakan, for, example, according, to, lieberman, and, aung, thwin, the, very, notion, of, mons, as, a, coherent, ethnicity, may, have, emerged, only, in, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, after, the, collapse, of, upper,

society, but, nonetheless, represented, an, important, social, class, the, majority, of, the, people, belonged, to, one, of, four, broad, groups, of, commoners, first, royal, servicemen, were, bondsmen, kyundaw, of, the, king, and, were, often, assigned, to, individual, headmen, and, officials, who, acted, as, the, king, s, representatives, they, received, land, grants, from, the, crown, and, were, exempt, from, most, personal, taxes, in, exchange, for, regular, or, military, service, second, athi, commoners, lived, not, on, royal, land, but, on, communally, held, land, and, owed, no, regular, royal, service, but, paid, substantial, head, taxes, private, bondsmen, kyun, owed, labour, only, to, their, individual, patron, and, lay, outside, the, system, of, royal, obligation, finally, religious, bondsmen, hpaya, kyun, were, also, private, bondsmen, who, owed, labour, only, to, monasteries, and, temples, but, not, to, the, crown, of, the, three, bonded, non, athi, classes, royal, bondsmen, and, religious, bondsmen, were, hereditary, while, private, bondsmen, were, not, a, private, bondsman, s, servitude, to, his, patron, stood, until, his, debt, was, fully, repaid, a, bondman, s, obligations, ceased, with, death, and, could, not, be, perpetuated, down, to, his, descendants, on, the, other, hand, royal, servicemen, kyundaw, were, hereditary, and, were, exempt, from, personal, taxes, in, exchange, for, royal, service, similarly, religious, servicemen, hpaya, kyun, were, hereditary, and, were, exempt, from, personal, taxes, and, royal, service, in, exchange, for, maintaining, the, affairs, of, monasteries, and, temples, unlike, royal, servicemen, or, even, athi, commoners, the, religious, bondsmen, could, not, be, conscripted, into, military, service, the, primary, language, of, the, ruling, class, of, pagan, was, burmese, a, tibeto, burman, language, related, to, both, the, pyu, language, and, the, language, of, the, ruling, class, of, nanzhao, but, the, spread, of, the, language, to, the, masses, lagged, behind, the, founding, of, the, pagan, empire, by, 75, to, 150, years, in, the, early, pagan, era, both, pyu, and, mon, were, lingua, francas, of, the, irrawaddy, valley, pyu, was, the, dominant, language, of, upper, myanmar, while, mon, was, sufficiently, prestigious, for, pagan, rulers, to, employ, the, language, frequently, for, inscriptions, and, perhaps, court, usages, inscriptional, evidence, indicates, that, burmese, became, the, lingua, franca, of, the, kingdom, only, in, the, early, 12th, century, and, perhaps, the, late, 12th, century, when, the, use, of, pyu, and, mon, in, official, usage, declined, mon, continued, to, flourish, in, lower, myanmar, but, pyu, as, a, language, had, died, out, by, the, early, 13th, century, another, important, development, in, burmese, history, and, burmese, language, was, the, rise, of, pali, the, liturgical, language, of, theravada, buddhism, the, use, of, sanskrit, which, had, been, prevalent, in, the, pyu, realm, and, in, the, early, pagan, era, declined, after, anawrahta, s, conversion, to, theravada, buddhism, the, spread, of, burmese, language, was, accompanied, by, that, of, the, burmese, alphabet, mainstream, scholarship, holds, that, the, burmese, alphabet, was, developed, from, the, mon, script, in, 1058, a, year, after, anawrahta, s, conquest, of, the, thaton, kingdom, burmese, script, may, have, instead, been, derived, from, the, pyu, script, in, the, 10th, century, based, on, whether, the, mon, script, found, in, myanmar, was, sufficiently, different, from, the, older, mon, script, found, in, the, mon, homelands, of, dvaravati, and, on, whether, a, recast, 18th, century, copy, of, an, original, stone, inscription, is, permissible, as, evidence, whatever, the, origin, of, the, burmese, alphabet, may, be, writing, in, burmese, was, still, a, novelty, in, the, 11th, century, a, written, burmese, language, became, dominant, in, court, only, in, the, 12th, century, for, much, of, the, pagan, period, written, materials, needed, to, produce, large, numbers, of, literate, monks, and, students, in, the, villages, simply, did, not, exist, according, to, than, tun, even, in, the, 13th, century, the, art, of, writing, was, then, still, in, its, infancy, with, the, burmans, manuscripts, were, rare, and, extremely, costly, as, late, as, 1273, a, complete, set, of, the, tripi, aka, cost, 3000, kyats, of, silver, which, could, buy, over, 2000, hectares, of, paddy, fields, literacy, in, burmese, not, to, mention, pali, was, the, effective, monopoly, of, the, aristocracy, and, their, monastic, peers, at, pagan, and, at, main, provincial, centres, buddhist, temples, supported, an, increasingly, sophisticated, pali, scholarship, which, specialised, in, grammar, and, philosophical, psychological, abhidhamma, studies, and, which, reportedly, won, the, admiration, of, sinhalese, experts, besides, religious, texts, pagan, s, monks, read, works, in, a, variety, of, languages, on, prosody, phonology, grammar, astrology, alchemy, and, medicine, and, developed, an, independent, school, of, legal, studies, most, students, and, probably, the, leading, monks, and, nuns, came, from, aristocratic, families, at, any, rate, local, illiteracy, probably, prevented, the, sort, of, detailed, village, censuses, and, legal, rulings, that, became, a, hallmark, of, post, 1550, toungoo, administration, the, religion, of, pagan, was, fluid, syncretic, and, by, later, standards, unorthodox, largely, a, continuation, of, religious, trends, in, the, pyu, era, where, theravada, buddhism, co, existed, with, mahayana, buddhism, tantric, buddhism, various, hindu, saivite, and, vaishana, schools, as, well, as, native, animist, nat, traditions, while, the, royal, patronage, of, theravada, buddhism, since, the, mid, 11th, century, had, enabled, the, buddhist, school, to, gradually, gain, primacy, and, produce, over, 10, 000, temples, in, pagan, alone, in, its, honour, other, traditions, continued, to, thrive, throughout, the, pagan, period, to, degrees, later, unseen, while, several, mahayana, tantric, hindu, and, animist, elements, have, remained, in, burmese, buddhism, to, the, present, day, in, the, pagan, era, however, tantric, saivite, and, vaishana, elements, enjoyed, greater, elite, influence, than, they, would, later, do, reflecting, both, the, immaturity, of, burmese, literary, culture, and, its, indiscriminate, receptivity, to, non, burman, traditions, in, this, period, heretical, did, not, mean, non, buddhist, merely, unfaithful, to, one, s, own, scriptures, whether, brahmanic, buddhist, or, whatever, one, of, the, most, enduring, developments, in, burmese, history, was, the, gradual, emergence, of, theravada, buddhism, as, the, primary, faith, of, the, pagan, empire, a, key, turning, point, came, c, 1056, when, the, buddhist, school, won, the, royal, patronage, of, an, ascendant, empire, with, anawrahta, s, conversion, from, his, native, tantric, buddhism, according, to, mainstream, scholarship, anawrahta, proceeded, to, revitalise, theravada, buddhism, in, upper, myanmar, with, help, from, the, conquered, kingdom, of, thaton, in, 1057, in, lower, myanmar, more, recently, however, aung, thwin, has, argued, forcefully, that, anawrahta, s, conquest, of, thaton, is, a, post, pagan, legend, without, contemporary, evidence, that, lower, myanmar, in, fact, lacked, a, substantial, independent, polity, prior, to, pagan, s, expansion, and, that, the, mon, influence, on, the, interior, is, greatly, exaggerated, instead, he, argues, that, it, is, more, likely, that, burmans, borrowed, theravada, buddhism, from, their, neighbour, pyus, or, directly, from, india, the, theravada, school, prevalent, in, the, early, and, mid, pagan, periods, like, in, the, pyu, realm, was, probably, derived, from, the, andhra, region, in, southeast, india, associated, with, the, famous, theravada, buddhist, scholar, buddhaghosa, it, was, the, predominant, theravada, school, in, myanmar, until, the, late, 12th, century, when, shin, uttarajiva, led, the, realignment, with, ceylon, s, mahavihara, school, to, be, sure, the, theravada, buddhist, scene, of, the, pagan, era, had, little, semblance, to, those, of, toungoo, and, konbaung, periods, much, of, the, institutional, mechanisms, prevalent, in, later, centuries, simply, did, not, yet, exist, for, instance, in, the, 19th, century, a, network, of, theravada, monasteries, in, every, village, used, burmese, language, manuscripts, to, provide, youths, from, diverse, backgrounds, with, basic, buddhist, literacy, this, was, a, reciprocal, exchange, monks, relied, on, villagers, for, their, daily, food, while, villagers, depended, on, monks, for, schooling, sermons, and, an, opportunity, to, gain, merit, by, giving, alms, and, inducting, their, young, men, into, the, community, of, monks, the, sangha, such, arrangements, produced, a, male, literacy, rates, of, over, 50, percent, and, remarkable, levels, of, textual, buddhist, knowledge, on, the, village, level, but, in, the, pagan, era, key, 19th, century, elements, were, not, yet, in, place, no, village, level, network, of, monasteries, or, meaningful, interdependence, between, the, monks, and, villagers, existed, the, monks, relied, on, the, royal, donations, and, those, from, major, sects, which, had, vast, landed, holdings, did, not, have, to, rely, on, daily, alms, inhibiting, close, interaction, with, villagers, the, low, levels, of, interaction, in, turn, retarded, literacy, in, burmese, and, limited, most, commoners, understanding, of, buddhism, to, non, textual, means, paintings, at, the, great, temples, pageants, folkloric, versions, of, the, jataka, stories, of, the, buddha, s, life, etc, most, commoners, retained, the, worship, of, nat, spirits, and, other, beliefs, other, traditions, also, continued, to, thrive, not, only, at, the, village, level, but, also, at, the, nominally, theravadin, court, one, powerful, group, was, the, forest, dweller, or, ari, monks, who, enjoyed, wide, influence, at, the, pagan, court, contemporary, inscriptions, show, that, the, aris, ate, evening, meals, and, presided, over, public, ceremonies, where, they, drank, liquor, and, where, cattle, and, other, animals, were, sacrificed, activities, considered, scandalous, by, burmese, buddhist, norms, of, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, aris, reportedly, also, enjoyed, a, form, of, ius, primae, noctis, at, least, prior, to, anawrahta, though, anawrahta, is, said, to, have, driven, out, the, aris, from, his, court, they, were, certainly, back, at, the, court, by, the, late, pagan, period, and, continued, to, be, a, presence, at, the, later, burmese, courts, down, to, the, ava, period, ari, buddhism, itself, was, a, mix, of, tantric, buddhism, and, local, traditions, for, example, ceremonial, animal, slaughter, and, alcohol, consumption, long, antedated, the, burmans, arrival, and, continued, in, remote, parts, of, mainland, and, maritime, southeast, asia, until, recent, times, the, state, also, accommodated, the, powerful, animist, traditions, as, shown, in, the, official, spirit, nat, propitiation, ceremonies, and, in, the, court, s, sponsorship, of, an, elaborate, nat, pantheon, that, sought, to, assimilate, local, deities, and, persons, of, prowess, to, a, more, unified, cultus, the, burmans, may, have, derived, the, concept, of, an, official, pantheon, from, mon, tradition, likewise, the, early, pagan, court, worshiped, snakes, nagas, venerated, in, pre, buddhist, times, to, judge, by, 14th, century, patterns, sacrifices, to, nat, spirits, mediated, by, shamans, were, still, a, central, village, ritual, as, elsewhere, in, southeast, asia, homosexuals, or, transvestites, who, already, inhabited, two, incompatible, realms, as, well, as, women, with, appropriate, powers, provided, a, shamanic, bridge, from, the, human, world, to, that, of, the, spirits, bagan, is, well, known, today, for, its, architecture, and, over, 2000, remaining, temples, that, dot, the, modern, day, pagan, bagan, plains, today, other, non, religious, aspects, of, pagan, architecture, were, equally, important, to, later, burmese, states, burman, immigrants, are, believed, to, have, either, introduced, new, water, management, techniques, or, greatly, enhanced, existing, pyu, system, of, weirs, dams, sluices, and, diversionary, barricades, the, techniques, of, building, dams, canals, and, weirs, found, in, pre, colonial, upper, myanmar, trace, their, origins, to, the, pyu, era, and, the, pagan, era, pagan, s, several, water, management, projects, in, the, dry, zone, provided, upper, myanmar, with, an, enduring, economic, base, to, dominate, the, rest, of, the, country, in, the, areas, of, city, planning, and, temple, design, pagan, architecture, borrowed, heavily, from, existing, pyu, architectural, practices, which, in, turn, were, based, on, various, indian, styles, pagan, era, city, planning, largely, followed, pyu, patterns, the, most, notable, being, the, use, of, 12, gates, for, each, of, the, signs, of, the, zodiac, pagan, stands, out, not, only, for, the, sheer, number, of, religious, edifices, but, also, for, the, magnificent, architecture, of, the, buildings, and, their, contribution, to, burmese, temple, design, pagan, temples, fall, into, one, of, two, broad, categories, the, stupa, style, solid, temple, and, the, gu, style, hollow, temple, a, stupa, also, called, a, pagoda, is, a, massive, structure, typically, with, a, relic, chamber, inside, the, pagan, stupas, or, pagodas, evolved, from, earlier, pyu, designs, which, in, turn, were, based, on, the, stupa, designs, of, the, andhra, region, particularly, amaravati, stupa, and, nagarjunakonda, in, present, day, southeastern, india, and, to, a, smaller, extent, to, ceylon, the, pagan, era, stupas, in, turn, were, the, prototypes, for, later, burmese, stupas, in, terms, of, symbolism, form, and, design, building, techniques, and, even, materials, originally, an, indian, ceylonese, stupa, had, a, hemispheric, body, pali, anda, the, egg, on, which, a, rectangular, box, surrounded, by, a, stone, balustrade, harmika, was, set, extending, up, from, the, top, of, the, stupa, was, a, shaft, supporting, several, ceremonial, umbrellas, the, stupa, is, a, representation, of, the, buddhist, cosmos, its, shape, symbolises, mount, meru, while, the, umbrella, mounted, on, the, brickwork, represents, the, world, s, axis, the, original, indic, design, was, gradually, modified, first, by, the, pyu, and, then, by, burmans, at, pagan, where, the, stupa, gradually, developed, a, longer, cylindrical, form, the, earliest, pagan, stupas, such, as, the, bupaya, c, 9th, century, were, the, direct, descendants, of, the, pyu, style, at, sri, ksetra, by, the, 11th, century, the, stupa, had, developed, into, a, more, bell, shaped, form, in, which, the, parasols, morphed, into, a, series, of, increasingly, smaller, rings, placed, on, one, top, of, the, other, rising, to, a, point, on, top, the, rings, the, new, design, replaced, the, harmika, with, a, lotus, bud, the, lotus, bud, design, then, evolved, into, the, banana, bud, which, forms, the, extended, apex, of, most, burmese, pagodas, three, or, four, rectangular, terraces, served, as, the, base, for, a, pagoda, often, with, a, gallery, of, terra, cotta, tiles, depicting, buddhist, jataka, stories, the, shwezigon, pagoda, and, the, shwesandaw, pagoda, are, the, earliest, examples, of, this, type, examples, of, the, trend, toward, a, more, bell, shaped, design, gradually, gained, primacy, as, seen, in, the, dhammayazika, pagoda, late, 12th, century, and, the, mingalazedi, pagoda, late, 13th, century, in, contrast, to, the, stupas, the, hollow, gu, style, temple, is, a, structure, used, for, meditation, devotional, worship, of, the, buddha, and, other, buddhist, rituals, the, gu, temples, come, in, two, basic, styles, one, face, design, and, four, face, design, essentially, one, main, entrance, and, four, main, entrances, other, styles, such, as, five, face, and, hybrids, also, exist, the, one, face, style, grew, out, of, 2nd, century, beikthano, and, the, four, face, out, of, 7th, century, sri, ksetra, the, temples, whose, main, features, were, the, pointed, arches, and, the, vaulted, chamber, became, larger, and, grander, in, the, pagan, period, although, the, burmese, temple, designs, evolved, from, indic, pyu, and, possibly, mon, styles, the, techniques, of, vaulting, seem, to, have, developed, in, pagan, itself, the, earliest, vaulted, temples, in, pagan, date, to, the, 11th, century, while, the, vaulting, did, not, become, widespread, in, india, until, the, late, 12th, century, the, masonry, of, the, buildings, shows, an, astonishing, degree, of, perfection, where, many, of, the, immense, structures, survived, the, 1975, earthquake, more, or, less, intact, unfortunately, the, vaulting, techniques, of, the, pagan, era, were, lost, in, the, later, periods, only, much, smaller, gu, style, temples, were, built, after, pagan, in, the, 18th, century, for, example, king, bodawpaya, attempted, to, build, the, mingun, pagoda, in, the, form, of, spacious, vaulted, chambered, temple, but, failed, as, craftsmen, and, masons, of, the, later, era, had, lost, the, knowledge, of, vaulting, and, keystone, arching, to, reproduce, the, spacious, interior, space, of, the, pagan, hollow, temples, another, architectural, innovation, originated, in, pagan, is, the, buddhist, temple, with, a, pentagonal, floor, plan, this, design, grew, out, of, hybrid, between, one, face, and, four, face, designs, designs, the, idea, was, to, include, the, veneration, of, the, maitreya, buddha, the, future, and, fifth, buddha, of, this, era, in, addition, to, the, four, who, had, already, appeared, the, dhammayazika, and, the, ngamyethna, pagoda, are, examples, of, the, pentagonal, design, the, kingdom, of, pagan, the, charter, polity, of, myanmar, had, a, lasting, impact, on, burmese, history, and, the, history, of, mainland, southeast, asia, the, success, and, longevity, of, pagan, s, dominance, over, the, irrawaddy, valley, enabled, the, ascent, of, burmese, language, and, culture, and, the, spread, of, bamar, ethnicity, in, upper, myanmar, and, laid, the, foundation, for, their, continued, spread, elsewhere, in, later, centuries, the, 250, year, rule, left, a, proven, system, of, administrative, and, cultural, norms, that, would, be, adopted, and, extended, by, successor, kingdoms, not, only, by, the, burmese, speaking, ava, kingdom, but, also, by, the, mon, speaking, hanthawaddy, kingdom, and, shan, speaking, shan, states, continued, cultural, integration, in, an, otherwise, politically, fragmented, post, pagan, myanmar, set, the, stage, for, a, resurgence, of, a, unified, burmese, state, in, the, 16th, century, an, apt, comparison, can, be, made, with, the, khmer, empire, the, other, southeast, asian, empire, that, mongol, invasions, toppled, various, tai, shan, peoples, who, came, down, with, the, mongols, came, to, dominate, the, political, landscapes, of, the, two, former, empires, whereas, myanmar, would, see, a, resurgence, the, post, mongol, khmer, state, was, reduced, to, a, mere, shadow, of, her, former, self, never, to, regain, her, preeminence, only, in, the, former, khmer, empire, did, the, thai, lao, ethnicity, and, thai, lao, languages, spread, permanently, at, the, expense, of, the, mon, khmer, speaking, peoples, not, unlike, the, burman, takeover, of, the, pyu, realm, four, centuries, earlier, in, myanmar, the, result, was, the, opposite, the, shan, leadership, as, well, as, lowland, shan, immigrants, of, myinsaing, pinya, sagaing, and, ava, kingdoms, came, to, adopt, burmese, cultural, norms, the, burmese, language, and, the, bamar, ethnicity, the, convergence, of, cultural, norms, around, existing, pagan, centered, norms, at, least, in, the, irrawaddy, valley, core, in, turn, facilitated, the, latter, day, political, reunification, drives, of, toungoo, and, konbaung, dynasties, the, pagan, empire, also, changed, the, history, of, mainland, southeast, asia, geopolitically, pagan, checked, the, khmer, empire, s, encroachment, into, the, tenasserim, coast, and, upper, menam, valley, culturally, the, emergence, of, pagan, as, a, theravada, stronghold, in, the, face, of, an, expanding, hindu, khmer, empire, from, the, 11th, to, 13th, centuries, provided, the, buddhist, school, which, had, been, in, retreat, elsewhere, in, south, asia, and, southeast, asia, a, much, needed, reprieve, and, a, safe, shelter, not, only, did, pagan, help, restart, theravada, buddhism, in, ceylon, but, the, over, two, centuries, of, patronage, by, a, powerful, empire, made, theravada, buddhism, s, later, growth, in, lan, na, northern, thailand, siam, central, thailand, lan, xang, laos, and, khmer, empire, cambodia, in, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, possible
