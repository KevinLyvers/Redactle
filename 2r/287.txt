end, of, that, century, uniting, eastern, rus, such, claims, raised, much, opposition, and, hostility, from, its, main, rival, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, which, controlled, a, large, western, portion, of, the, land, of, ancient, rus, and, hence, denied, any, claims, and, even, the, self, name, of, the, eastern, neighbour, under, the, polish, lithuanian, influence, the, country, began, to, be, called, muscovy, latin, moscovia, muscovy, french, moscovie, in, western, europe, the, first, appearances, of, the, term, were, in, an, italian, document, of, 1500, initially, moscovia, was, the,

muscovy, persisted, in, the, west, until, the, beginning, of, the, 18th, century, and, is, still, used, in, historical, contexts, the, term, remains, current, in, arabic, as, an, alternative, name, for, russia, derived, from, it, is, al, muskub, ya, the, arabic, name, of, the, russian, compound, district, of, jerusalem, where, czarist, russia, established, various, institutions, in, the, 19th,

orthodox, traditions, for, the, most, part, under, the, tatar, yoke, more, important, to, the, development, of, the, state, of, moscow, however, was, its, rule, by, a, series, of, princes, who, expanded, its, borders, and, turned, a, small, principality, in, the, moscow, river, basin, into, the, largest, state, in, europe, of, the, 16th, century, the, first, ruler, of, the, principality, of, moscow, daniel, i, d, 1303, was, the, youngest, son, of, alexander, nevsky, of, vladimir, suzdal, he, started, to, expand, his, principality, by, seizing, kolomna, and, securing, the, bequest, of, pereslavl, zalessky, to, his, family, daniel, s, son, yury, also, known, as, georgiy, ruled, 1303, 1325, controlled, the, entire, basin, of, the, moskva, river, and, expanded, westward, by, conquering, mozhaisk, he, then, allied, with, the, overlord, of, the, principalities, uzbeg, khan, of, the, golden, horde, and, married, the, khan, s, sister, the, khan, allowed, yuriy, to, claim, the, title, of, grand, duke, of, vladimir, suzdal, a, position, which, allowed, him, to, interfere, in, the, affairs, of, the, novgorod, republic, to, the, northwest, by, the, early, 14th, century, moscow, had, improved, its, standing, against, other, towns, within, its, parent, principality, of, vladimir, suzdal, and, by, the, 1320s, it, emerged, as, the, most, influential, largely, due, to, decisions, made, by, the, mongol, khan, aside, from, this, the, metropolitan, of, kiev, and, all, rus, started, to, be, based, in, moscow, too, in, 1325, metropolitan, peter, died, 1326, transferred, his, residence, from, kiev, to, vladimir, and, then, to, moscow, further, enhancing, the, prestige, of, the, new, principality, yuriy, s, successor, ivan, i, ruled, 1325, 1340, managed, to, retain, the, title, of, grand, duke, by, cooperating, closely, with, the, mongols, and, by, collecting, tribute, and, taxes, from, the, other, principalities, on, their, behalf, this, relationship, enabled, ivan, to, gain, regional, ascendancy, particularly, over, moscow, s, chief, rival, the, northern, city, of, tver, which, rebelled, against, the, horde, in, 1327, the, uprising, was, subdued, by, the, joint, forces, of, the, grand, principality, of, suzdal, the, grand, principality, of, moscow, which, competed, with, tver, for, the, title, of, grand, duke, of, vladimir, and, tatars, ivan, s, moniker, kalita, literally, the, moneybag, was, an, indication, of, his, character, as, a, businessman, he, used, his, treasures, to, purchase, land, in, other, principalities, and, to, finance, the, construction, of, stone, churches, in, the, moscow, kremlin, ivan, s, successors, continued, the, gathering, of, the, russian, lands, to, increase, the, population, and, wealth, under, their, rule, in, the, process, their, interests, clashed, with, the, expanding, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, whose, subjects, were, predominantly, east, slavic, and, orthodox, grand, duke, algirdas, of, lithuania, allied, himself, by, marriage, with, tver, and, undertook, three, expeditions, against, moscow, 1368, 1370, 1372, but, was, unable, to, take, it, the, main, bone, of, contention, between, moscow, and, vilnius, was, the, large, city, of, smolensk, in, the, 1350s, the, country, and, the, royal, family, were, hit, by, the, black, death, dmitry, ivanovich, was, aged, nine, when, his, parents, died, and, the, title, of, grand, duke, slipped, into, the, hands, of, his, distant, relative, dmitry, of, suzdal, surrounded, by, lithuanians, and, muslim, nomads, the, ruler, of, moscow, cultivated, an, alliance, with, the, rus, orthodox, church, which, experienced, a, resurgence, in, influence, due, to, the, monastic, reform, of, st, sergius, of, radonezh, educated, by, metropolitan, alexis, dmitri, posed, as, a, champion, of, orthodoxy, and, managed, to, unite, the, warring, principalities, of, rus, in, his, struggle, against, the, horde, he, challenged, khan, s, authority, and, defeated, his, commander, mamai, in, the, epic, battle, of, kulikovo, 1380, however, the, victory, did, not, bring, any, short, term, benefits, tokhtamysh, in, 1382, sacked, moscow, hoping, to, reassert, his, vested, authority, over, his, vassal, the, grand, prince, and, his, own, mongol, hegemony, killing, 24, 000, people, nevertheless, dmitri, became, a, national, hero, the, memory, of, kulikovo, field, made, the, russian, population, start, believing, in, their, ability, to, end, tatar, domination, and, become, a, free, people, in, 1389, he, passed, the, throne, to, his, son, vasily, i, without, bothering, to, obtain, the, khan, s, sanction, vasily, i, 1389, 1425, continued, the, policies, of, his, father, after, the, horde, was, attacked, by, tamerlane, he, desisted, from, paying, tribute, to, the, khan, but, was, forced, to, pursue, a, more, conciliatory, policy, after, edigu, s, incursion, on, moscow, in, 1408, married, to, the, only, daughter, of, the, grand, duke, vytautas, of, lithuania, he, attempted, to, avoid, open, conflicts, with, his, powerful, father, in, law, even, when, the, latter, annexed, smolensk, the, peaceful, years, of, his, long, reign, were, marked, by, the, continuing, expansion, to, the, east, annexation, of, nizhny, novgorod, and, suzdal, 1392, and, to, the, north, annexation, of, vologda, veliky, ustyug, and, perm, of, vychegda, 1398, nizhny, novgorod, was, given, by, the, khan, of, the, golden, horde, as, a, reward, for, muscovite, s, help, against, a, rival, the, reforms, of, st, sergius, triggered, a, cultural, revival, exemplified, by, the, icons, and, frescoes, of, the, monk, andrei, rublev, hundreds, of, monasteries, were, founded, by, disciples, of, st, sergius, in, distant, and, inhospitable, locations, including, beloozero, and, solovki, apart, from, their, cultural, functions, these, monasteries, were, major, landowners, who, could, control, the, economy, of, an, adjacent, region, they, served, as, outposts, of, moscow, s, influence, in, the, neighbouring, principalities, and, republics, another, factor, responsible, for, the, expansion, of, the, grand, principality, of, moscow, was, its, favourable, dynastic, situation, in, which, each, sovereign, was, succeeded, by, his, son, while, rival, principalities, were, plagued, by, dynastic, strife, and, splintered, into, ever, smaller, polities, the, only, lateral, branch, of, the, house, of, moscow, represented, by, vladimir, of, serpukhov, and, his, descendants, was, firmly, anchored, to, the, moscow, principality, the, situation, changed, with, the, ascension, of, vasily, i, s, successor, vasily, ii, r, 1425, 1462, before, long, his, uncle, yuri, of, zvenigorod, started, to, advance, his, claims, to, the, throne, and, monomakh, s, cap, a, bitter, family, conflict, erupted, and, rocked, the, country, during, the, whole, reign, after, yuri, died, in, 1432, the, claims, were, taken, up, by, his, sons, vasily, kosoy, and, dmitry, shemyaka, who, pursued, the, great, feudal, war, well, into, the, 1450s, although, he, was, ousted, from, moscow, on, several, occasions, taken, prisoner, by, olug, moxammat, of, kazan, and, blinded, in, 1446, vasily, ii, eventually, managed, to, triumph, over, his, enemies, and, pass, the, throne, to, his, son, at, his, urging, a, native, bishop, was, elected, as, metropolitan, of, moscow, which, was, tantamount, to, a, declaration, of, independence, of, the, russian, orthodox, church, from, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, 1448, the, outward, expansion, of, the, grand, principality, in, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, was, accompanied, by, internal, consolidation, by, the, 15th, century, the, rulers, of, moscow, considered, the, entire, territory, of, the, former, kievan, rus, to, be, their, collective, property, various, semi, independent, princes, of, rurikid, stock, still, claimed, specific, territories, but, ivan, iii, the, great, r, 1462, 1505, forced, the, lesser, princes, to, acknowledge, the, grand, prince, of, moscow, and, his, descendants, as, unquestioned, rulers, with, control, over, military, judicial, and, foreign, affairs, moscow, gained, full, sovereignty, over, a, significant, part, of, rus, by, 1480, when, the, overlordship, of, the, tatar, golden, horde, officially, ended, after, its, defeat, in, the, great, stand, on, the, ugra, river, by, the, beginning, of, the, 16th, century, virtually, all, those, lands, were, united, including, the, novgorod, republic, annexed, in, 1478, and, the, principality, of, tver, annexed, in, 1485, through, inheritance, ivan, was, able, to, control, the, important, principality, of, ryazan, and, the, princes, of, rostov, and, yaroslavl, subordinated, themselves, to, him, the, northwestern, city, of, pskov, consisting, of, the, city, and, a, few, surrounding, lands, remained, independent, in, this, period, but, ivan, s, son, vasili, iii, r, 1505, 33, later, conquered, it, having, consolidated, the, core, of, russia, under, his, rule, ivan, iii, became, the, first, moscow, ruler, to, adopt, the, titles, of, tsar, and, ruler, of, all, rus, ivan, competed, with, his, powerful, northwestern, rival, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, for, control, over, some, of, the, semi, independent, former, principalities, of, kievan, rus, in, the, upper, dnieper, and, donets, river, basins, through, the, defections, of, some, princes, border, skirmishes, and, the, long, inconclusive, russo, lithuanian, wars, that, ended, only, in, 1503, ivan, iii, was, able, to, push, westward, and, the, moscow, state, tripled, in, size, under, his, rule, the, reign, of, the, tsars, started, officially, with, ivan, the, terrible, the, first, monarch, to, be, crowned, tsar, of, russia, but, in, practice, it, started, with, ivan, iii, who, completed, the, centralization, of, the, state, traditionally, known, as, the, gathering, of, the, russian, lands, the, court, of, the, moscow, princes, combined, ceremonies, and, customs, inherited, from, kievan, rus, with, those, imported, from, the, byzantine, empire, and, golden, horde, some, traditional, russian, offices, like, that, of, tysyatsky, and, veche, were, gradually, abolished, to, consolidate, power, in, the, hands, of, the, ruling, prince, a, new, elaborate, system, of, court, precedence, or, mestnichestvo, predicated, the, nobleman, s, rank, and, function, on, the, rank, and, function, of, his, ancestors, and, other, members, of, his, family, the, highest, echelon, of, hereditary, nobles, was, composed, of, boyars, they, fell, into, three, categories, rurikid, and, gediminid, boyars, whose, fathers, and, grandfathers, were, independent, princelings, felt, that, they, were, kin, to, the, grand, prince, and, hence, almost, equal, to, him, during, the, times, of, dynastic, troubles, such, as, the, years, of, ivan, iv, s, minority, boyardom, constituted, an, internal, force, that, was, a, permanent, threat, to, the, throne, an, early, form, of, the, monarch, s, conflict, with, the, boyars, was, the, oprichnina, policy, of, ivan, the, terrible, during, such, conflicts, ivan, boris, godunov, and, some, later, monarchs, felt, the, necessity, to, counterbalance, the, boyardom, by, creating, a, new, kind, of, nobility, based, on, personal, devotion, to, the, tsar, and, merits, earned, by, faithful, service, rather, than, by, heredity, later, these, new, nobles, were, called, dvoryans, singular, dvoryanin, the, name, comes, from, the, russian, word, dvor, meaning, tsar, s, dvor, i, e, the, court, hence, the, expression, pozhalovat, ko, dvoru, i, e, to, be, called, to, serve, the, court, relations, between, the, moscow, principality, and, the, horde, were, mixed, in, the, first, two, decades, of, the, 13th, century, moscow, gained, the, support, of, one, of, the, rivalling, mongol, statesmen, nogai, against, the, principalities, that, were, oriented, towards, sarai, khans, after, the, restoration, of, unity, in, the, golden, horde, in, the, early, 14th, century, it, generally, enjoyed, the, favour, of, the, khans, until, 1317, but, lost, it, in, 1322, 1327, the, following, thirty, years, when, the, relations, between, the, two, states, improved, allowed, moscow, to, achieve, sufficient, economic, and, political, potential, further, attempts, to, deprive, its, rulers, of, the, status, of, grand, dukes, of, vladimir, were, unsuccessful, after, the, khanate, sank, into, internecine, war, and, proved, to, be, fruitless, during, the, reign, of, a, relatively, powerful, khan, such, as, mamai, whereas, tokhtamysh, had, no, other, choice, but, to, recognize, the, supremacy, of, moscow, over, northern, and, eastern, russian, lands, the, traditional, mongol, principle, of, breaking, up, larger, concentrations, of, power, into, smaller, ones, failed, and, the, following, period, is, characterized, by, the, lack, of, support, from, the, horde, although, moscow, recognized, khans, as, the, legitimate, authority, in, the, early, years, of, the, mongol, tatar, yoke, despite, certain, acts, of, resistance, and, disobedience, it, refused, to, acknowledge, their, suzerainty, in, the, years, 1374, 1380, 1396, 1411, 1414, 1416, and, 1417, 1419, even, despite, the, growing, might, of, the, golden, horde, the, power, of, the, horde, over, moscow, was, greatly, limited, in, the, reign, of, dmitri, donskoi, who, gained, recognition, of, the, grand, principality, of, vladimir, as, a, hereditary, possession, of, moscow, princes, while, the, horde, collected, tribute, from, his, land, it, could, no, longer, have, a, serious, impact, on, the, internal, structure, of, northern, russian, lands, in, the, years, of, vasily, ii, and, ivan, iii, the, grand, principality, of, moscow, acquired, the, idea, of, tsardom, from, the, fallen, byzantine, empire, which, was, incompatible, with, the, recognition, of, the, suzerainty, of, the, khan, and, started, to, declare, its, independence, in, diplomatic, relations, with, other, countries, this, process, was, complete, by, the, reign, of, ivan, iii, the, development, of, the, modern, day, russian, state, is, traced, from, kievan, rus, through, vladimir, suzdal, and, the, grand, principality, of, moscow, to, the, tsardom, of, russia, and, then, the, russian, empire, the, moscow, principality, drew, people, and, wealth, to, the, northeastern, part, of, kievan, rus, established, trade, links, to, the, baltic, sea, white, sea, caspian, sea, and, to, siberia, and, created, a, highly, centralized, and, autocratic, political, system, the, political, traditions, established, in, muscovy, therefore, exerted, a, powerful, influence, on, the, future, development, of, russian, society, muscovite, russia, was, culturally, influenced, by, slavic, and, byzantine, cultural, elements, in, muscovite, russia, supernaturalism, was, a, fundamental, part, of, daily, life
