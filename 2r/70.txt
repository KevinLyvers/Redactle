the, control, of, fire, by, early, humans, was, a, critical, technology, enabling, the, evolution, of, humans, fire, provided, a, source, of, warmth, and, lighting, protection, from, predators, especially, at, night, a, way, to, create, more, advanced, hunting, tools, and, a, method, for, cooking, food, these, cultural, advances, allowed, human, geographic, dispersal, cultural, innovations, and, changes, to, diet, and, behavior, additionally, creating, fire, allowed, human, activity, to, continue, into, the, dark, and, colder, hours, of, the, evening, claims, for, the, earliest, definitive, evidence, of, control, of, fire, by, a, member, of, homo, range, from, 1, 7, to, 2, 0, million, years, ago, mya, evidence, for, the, microscopic, traces, of, wood, ash, as, controlled, use, of, fire, by, homo, erectus, beginning, roughly, 1, million, years, ago, has, wide, scholarly, support, some, of, the, earliest, known, traces, of, controlled, fire, were, found, at, the, daughters, of, jacob, bridge, israel, and, dated, to, 790, 000, years, ago, at, the, site, archaeologists, also, found, the, oldest, likely, evidence, of, controlled, use, of, fire, to, cook, food, 780, 000, years, ago, however, some, studies, suggest, cooking, started, 1, 8, million, years, ago, flint, blades, burned, in, fires, roughly, 300, 000, years, ago, were, found, near, fossils, of, early, but, not, entirely, modern, homo, sapiens, in, morocco, fire, was, used, regularly, and, systematically, by, early, modern, humans, to, heat, treat, silcrete, stone, to, increase, its, flake, ability, for, the, purpose, of, toolmaking, approximately, 164, 000, years, ago, at, the, south, african, site, of, pinnacle, point, evidence, of, widespread, control, of, fire, by, anatomically, modern, humans, dates, to, approximately, 125, 000, years, ago, the, use, and, control, of, fire, was, a, gradual, process, proceeding, through, more, than, one, stage, one, was, a, change, in, habitat, from, dense, forest, where, wildfires, were, rare, but, difficult, to, escape, to, savanna, mixed, grass, woodland, where, wildfires, were, common, but, easier, to, survive, such, a, change, may, have, occurred, about, 3, million, years, ago, when, the, savanna, expanded, in, east, africa, due, to, cooler, and, drier, climate, the, next, stage, involved, interaction, with, burned, landscapes, and, foraging, in, the, wake, of, wildfires, as, observed, in, various, wild, animals, in, the, african, savanna, animals, that, preferentially, forage, in, recently, burned, areas, include, savanna, chimpanzees, a, variety, of, pan, troglodytes, verus, vervet, monkeys, cercopithecus, aethiops, and, a, variety, of, birds, some, of, which, also, hunt, insects, and, small, vertebrates, in, the, wake, of, grass, fires, the, next, step, would, be, to, make, some, use, of, residual, hot, spots, that, occur, in, the, wake, of, wildfires, for, example, foods, found, in, the, wake, of, wildfires, tend, to, be, either, burned, or, undercooked, this, might, have, provided, incentives, to, place, undercooked, foods, on, a, hotspot, or, to, pull, food, out, of, the, fire, if, it, was, in, danger, of, getting, burned, this, would, require, familiarity, with, fire, and, its, behavior, an, early, step, in, the, control, of, fire, would, have, been, transporting, it, from, burned, to, unburned, areas, and, lighting, them, on, fire, providing, advantages, in, food, acquisition, maintaining, a, fire, over, an, extended, period, of, time, as, for, a, season, such, as, the, dry, season, may, have, led, to, the, development, of, base, campsites, building, a, hearth, or, other, fire, enclosure, such, as, a, circle, of, stones, would, have, been, a, later, development, the, ability, to, make, fire, generally, with, a, friction, device, with, hardwood, rubbing, against, softwood, as, in, a, bow, drill, was, a, later, development, each, of, these, stages, could, occur, at, different, intensities, ranging, from, occasional, or, opportunistic, to, habitual, to, obligate, unable, to, survive, without, it, most, of, the, evidence, of, controlled, use, of, fire, during, the, lower, paleolithic, is, uncertain, and, has, limited, scholarly, support, some, of, the, evidence, is, inconclusive, because, other, plausible, explanations, such, as, natural, processes, exist, for, the, findings, findings, support, that, the, earliest, known, controlled, use, of, fire, took, place, in, wonderwerk, cave, south, africa, 1, 0, mya, findings, from, wonderwerk, provide, the, earliest, evidence, for, controlled, use, of, fire, intact, sediments, were, analyzed, using, micromorphological, analysis, fourier, transform, infrared, microspectroscopy, mftir, yielded, evidence, in, the, form, of, burned, bones, and, ashed, plant, remains, that, burning, took, place, at, the, site, 1, 0, mya, east, african, sites, such, as, chesowanja, near, lake, baringo, koobi, fora, and, olorgesailie, in, kenya, show, possible, evidence, that, fire, was, controlled, by, early, humans, in, chesowanja, archaeologists, found, red, clay, clasts, dated, to, 1, 4, mya, these, clasts, must, have, been, heated, to, 400, c, 750, f, to, harden, however, tree, stumps, burned, in, bush, fires, in, east, africa, produce, clasts, which, when, broken, by, erosion, are, like, those, described, at, chesownja, controlled, use, of, fire, at, chesowanja, is, unproven, in, koobi, fora, sites, show, evidence, of, control, of, fire, by, homo, erectus, at, 1, 5, mya, with, findings, of, reddened, sediment, that, could, come, from, heating, at, 200, 400, c, 400, 750, f, evidence, of, possible, human, control, of, fire, found, at, swartkrans, south, africa, includes, burned, bones, including, ones, with, hominin, inflicted, cut, marks, along, with, acheulean, and, bone, tools, this, site, shows, some, of, the, earliest, evidence, of, carnivorous, behavior, in, h, erectus, a, hearth, like, depression, that, could, have, been, used, to, burn, bones, was, found, in, olorgesailie, kenya, however, it, did, not, contain, any, charcoal, and, no, signs, of, fire, have, been, observed, some, microscopic, charcoal, was, found, but, it, could, have, resulted, from, a, natural, brush, fire, in, gadeb, ethiopia, fragments, of, welded, tuff, that, appeared, to, have, been, burned, were, found, in, locality, 8e, but, refiring, of, the, rocks, might, have, occurred, due, to, local, volcanic, activity, in, the, middle, awash, river, valley, cone, shaped, depressions, of, reddish, clay, were, found, that, could, have, been, formed, by, temperatures, of, 200, c, 400, f, these, features, thought, to, have, been, created, by, burning, tree, stumps, were, hypothesized, to, have, been, produced, by, early, hominids, lighting, tree, stumps, so, they, could, have, fire, away, from, their, habitation, site, this, view, is, not, widely, accepted, though, burned, stones, were, found, in, awash, valley, but, volcanic, welded, tuff, is, found, in, the, area, which, could, explain, the, burned, stones, burned, flints, discovered, near, jebel, irhoud, morocco, dated, by, thermoluminescence, to, around, 300, 000, years, old, were, discovered, in, the, same, sedimentary, layer, as, skulls, of, early, homo, sapiens, paleoanthropologist, jean, jacques, hublin, believes, the, flints, were, used, as, spear, tips, and, left, in, fires, used, by, the, early, humans, for, cooking, food, in, xihoudu, in, shanxi, province, china, the, black, blue, and, grayish, green, discoloration, of, mammalian, bones, found, at, the, site, illustrates, evidence, of, burning, by, early, hominids, in, 1985, at, a, parallel, site, in, china, yuanmou, in, yunnan, province, archaeologists, found, blackened, mammal, bones, that, date, back, to, 1, 7, mya, a, site, at, bnot, ya, akov, bridge, israel, has, been, claimed, to, show, that, h, erectus, or, h, ergaster, controlled, fires, between, 790, 000, and, 690, 000, bp, an, ai, powered, spectroscopy, helped, researchers, unearth, evidence, of, the, use, of, fire, dating, 800, 000, and, 1, million, years, ago, in, an, article, published, in, june, 2022, researchers, from, weizmann, institute, of, science, along, with, researchers, at, the, university, of, toronto, and, hebrew, university, of, jerusalem, described, the, use, of, deep, learning, models, to, analyze, heat, exposure, of, 26, flint, tools, that, were, found, in, 1970s, at, the, evron, quarry, in, the, northwest, of, israel, the, results, showed, the, tools, were, heated, up, to, 600, c, at, trinil, java, burned, wood, has, been, found, in, layers, that, carried, h, erectus, java, man, fossils, dating, from, 830, 000, to, 500, 000, bp, the, burned, wood, has, been, claimed, to, indicate, the, use, of, fire, by, early, hominids, the, cave, of, hearths, in, south, africa, has, burn, deposits, which, date, from, 700, 000, to, 200, 000, bp, as, do, various, other, sites, such, as, montagu, cave, 200, 000, to, 58, 000, bp, and, the, klasies, river, mouth, 130, 000, to, 120, 000, bp, strong, evidence, comes, from, kalambo, falls, in, zambia, where, several, artifacts, related, to, the, use, of, fire, by, humans, have, been, recovered, including, charred, logs, charcoal, carbonized, grass, stems, and, plants, and, wooden, implements, which, may, have, been, hardened, by, fire, the, site, has, been, dated, through, radiocarbon, dating, to, 180, 000, bp, through, amino, acid, racemization, fire, was, used, for, heat, treatment, of, silcrete, stones, to, increase, their, workability, before, they, were, knapped, into, tools, by, stillbay, culture, in, south, africa, these, stillbay, sites, date, back, from, 164, 000, to, 72, 000, years, ago, with, the, heat, treatment, of, stone, beginning, by, about, 164, 000, years, ago, evidence, at, zhoukoudian, cave, in, china, suggests, control, of, fire, as, early, as, 460, 000, to, 230, 000, bp, fire, in, zhoukoudian, is, suggested, by, the, presence, of, burned, bones, burned, chipped, stone, artifacts, charcoal, ash, and, hearths, alongside, h, erectus, fossils, in, layer, 10, the, earliest, archaeological, horizon, at, the, site, this, evidence, comes, from, locality, 1, also, known, as, the, peking, man, site, where, several, bones, were, found, to, be, uniformly, black, to, grey, the, bone, extracts, were, determined, to, be, characteristic, of, burned, bone, rather, than, manganese, staining, these, residues, also, showed, ir, spectra, for, oxides, and, a, turquoise, bone, was, reproduced, in, the, laboratory, by, heating, some, of, the, other, bones, found, in, layer, 10, the, same, effect, might, have, been, at, the, site, due, to, natural, heating, as, the, effect, was, produced, on, white, yellow, and, black, bones, layer, 10, is, ash, with, biologically, produced, silicon, aluminum, iron, and, potassium, but, wood, ash, remnants, such, as, siliceous, aggregates, are, missing, among, these, are, possible, hearths, represented, by, finely, laminated, silt, and, clay, interbedded, with, reddish, brown, and, yellow, brown, fragments, of, organic, matter, locally, mixed, with, limestone, fragments, and, dark, brown, finely, laminated, silt, clay, and, organic, matter, the, site, itself, does, not, show, that, fires, were, made, in, zhoukoudian, but, the, association, of, blackened, bones, with, quartzite, artifacts, at, least, shows, that, humans, did, control, fire, at, the, time, of, the, habitation, of, the, zhoukoudian, cave, at, the, amudian, site, of, qesem, cave, near, the, city, of, kfar, qasim, israel, evidence, exists, of, the, regular, use, of, fire, from, before, 382, 000, bp, to, around, 200, 000, bp, at, the, end, of, lower, pleistocene, large, quantities, of, burned, bone, and, moderately, heated, soil, lumps, were, found, and, the, cut, marks, found, on, the, bones, suggest, that, butchering, and, prey, defleshing, took, place, near, fireplaces, in, addition, hominins, living, in, qesem, cave, managed, to, heat, their, flint, to, varying, temperatures, before, knapping, it, into, different, tools, the, earliest, evidence, for, controlled, fire, use, by, humans, on, the, indian, subcontinent, dating, to, between, 50, 000, and, 55, 000, years, ago, comes, from, the, main, belan, archaeological, site, located, in, the, belan, river, valley, in, uttar, pradesh, india, multiple, sites, in, europe, such, as, torralba, and, ambrona, spain, and, st, esteve, janson, france, have, also, shown, evidence, of, the, use, of, fire, by, later, versions, of, h, erectus, the, oldest, has, been, found, in, england, at, the, site, of, beeches, pit, suffolk, uranium, series, dating, and, thermoluminescence, dating, place, the, use, of, fire, at, 415, 000, bp, at, v, rtessz, l, s, hungary, while, no, charcoal, has, been, found, burned, bones, have, been, discovered, dating, from, c, 350, 000, years, ago, at, torralba, and, ambrona, spain, objects, such, as, acheulean, stone, tools, remains, of, large, mammals, such, as, extinct, elephants, charcoal, and, wood, were, discovered, at, terra, amata, in, france, there, is, a, fireplace, with, ashes, dated, between, 380, 000, bp, and, 230, 000, bp, at, saint, est, ve, janson, in, france, there, is, evidence, of, five, hearths, and, reddened, earth, in, the, escale, cave, these, hearths, have, been, dated, to, 200, 000, bp, evidence, for, fire, making, dates, to, at, least, the, middle, paleolithic, with, dozens, of, neanderthal, hand, axes, from, france, exhibiting, use, wear, traces, suggesting, these, tools, were, struck, with, the, mineral, pyrite, to, produce, sparks, around, 50, 000, years, ago, the, discovery, of, fire, came, to, provide, a, wide, variety, of, uses, for, early, hominids, its, warmth, kept, them, alive, during, low, nighttime, temperatures, in, colder, environments, allowing, geographic, expansion, from, tropical, and, subtropical, climates, to, temperate, areas, its, blaze, warded, off, predatory, animals, especially, in, the, dark, fire, also, played, a, major, role, in, changing, food, habits, cooking, allowed, a, significant, increase, in, meat, consumption, and, calorie, intake, it, was, soon, discovered, that, meat, could, also, be, dried, and, smoked, by, fire, preserving, it, for, lean, seasons, fire, was, even, used, in, manufacturing, tools, for, hunting, and, butchering, hominids, also, learned, that, starting, bush, fires, to, burn, large, areas, could, increase, land, fertility, and, clear, terrain, to, make, hunting, easier, evidence, shows, that, early, hominids, were, able, to, corral, and, trap, prey, animals, by, means, of, fire, fire, was, used, to, clear, out, caves, prior, to, living, in, them, helping, to, begin, the, use, of, shelter, the, many, uses, of, fire, may, have, led, to, specialized, social, roles, such, as, the, separation, of, cooking, from, hunting, the, control, of, fire, enabled, important, changes, in, human, behavior, health, energy, expenditure, and, geographic, expansion, hominids, could, move, into, much, colder, regions, that, would, have, previously, been, uninhabitable, after, the, loss, of, body, hair, evidence, of, more, complex, management, to, change, biomes, can, be, found, as, far, back, as, 200, 000, to, 100, 000, years, ago, at, a, minimum, fire, allowed, major, innovations, in, tool, and, weapon, manufacture, evidence, dating, to, roughly, 164, 000, years, ago, indicates, that, early, humans, in, south, africa, during, the, middle, stone, age, used, fire, to, alter, the, mechanical, properties, of, tool, materials, applying, heat, treatment, to, a, fine, grained, rock, called, silcrete, the, heated, rocks, were, then, tempered, into, crescent, shaped, blades, or, arrowheads, for, hunting, and, butchering, prey, this, may, have, been, the, first, time, that, bow, and, arrow, were, used, for, hunting, with, far, ranging, impact, fire, was, used, in, the, creation, of, art, archaeologists, have, discovered, several, 1, to, 10, inch, venus, figurine, statues, in, europe, dating, to, the, paleolithic, several, carved, from, stone, and, ivory, others, shaped, from, clay, and, then, fired, these, are, some, of, the, earliest, examples, of, ceramics, fire, was, also, commonly, used, to, create, pottery, although, pottery, was, formerly, thought, to, have, begun, with, the, neolithic, around, 10, 000, years, ago, scientists, in, china, discovered, pottery, fragments, in, the, xianrendong, cave, that, were, about, 20, 000, years, old, during, the, neolithic, age, and, agricultural, revolution, about, 10, 000, years, ago, pottery, became, far, more, common, and, widespread, often, carved, and, painted, with, simple, linear, designs, and, geometric, shapes, fire, was, an, important, factor, in, expanding, and, developing, societies, of, early, hominids, one, impact, fire, might, have, had, was, social, stratification, the, power, to, make, and, wield, fire, may, have, conferred, prestige, and, social, position, fire, also, led, to, a, lengthening, of, daytime, activities, and, allowed, more, nighttime, activities, evidence, of, large, hearths, indicate, that, the, majority, of, nighttime, was, spent, around, the, fire, the, increased, social, interaction, from, gathering, around, the, fire, may, have, fostered, the, development, of, language, another, effect, of, fire, use, on, hominid, societies, was, that, it, required, larger, groups, to, work, together, to, maintain, the, fire, finding, fuel, portioning, it, onto, the, fire, and, re, igniting, it, when, necessary, these, larger, groups, might, have, included, older, individuals, such, as, grandparents, who, helped, to, care, for, children, ultimately, fire, had, a, significant, influence, on, the, size, and, social, interactions, of, early, hominid, communities, exposure, to, artificial, light, during, later, hours, of, the, day, changed, humans, circadian, rhythms, contributing, to, a, longer, waking, day, the, modern, human, s, waking, day, is, 16, hours, while, many, mammals, are, only, awake, for, half, as, many, hours, additionally, humans, are, most, awake, during, the, early, evening, hours, while, other, primates, days, begin, at, dawn, and, end, at, sundown, many, of, these, behavioral, changes, can, be, attributed, to, the, control, of, fire, and, its, impact, on, daylight, extension, the, cooking, hypothesis, proposes, the, idea, that, the, ability, to, cook, allowed, for, the, brain, size, of, hominids, to, increase, over, time, this, idea, was, first, presented, by, friedrich, engels, in, the, article, the, part, played, by, labour, in, the, transition, from, ape, to, man, and, later, recapitulated, in, the, book, catching, fire, how, cooking, made, us, human, by, richard, wrangham, and, then, in, a, book, by, suzana, herculano, houzel, critics, of, the, hypothesis, argue, that, cooking, with, controlled, fire, was, insufficient, to, start, the, increasing, brain, size, trend, the, cooking, hypothesis, gains, support, by, comparing, the, nutrients, in, raw, food, to, the, much, more, easily, digested, nutrients, in, cooked, food, as, in, an, examination, of, protein, ingestion, from, raw, vs, cooked, egg, scientists, have, found, that, among, several, primates, the, restriction, of, feeding, to, raw, foods, during, daylight, hours, limits, the, metabolic, energy, available, genus, homo, was, able, to, break, through, the, limit, by, cooking, food, to, shorten, their, feeding, times, and, be, able, to, absorb, more, nutrients, to, accommodate, the, increasing, need, for, energy, in, addition, scientists, argue, that, the, homo, species, was, also, able, to, obtain, nutrients, like, docosahexaenoic, acid, from, algae, that, were, especially, beneficial, and, critical, for, brain, evolution, and, the, detoxification, of, food, by, the, cooking, process, enabled, early, humans, to, access, these, resources, besides, the, brain, other, human, organs, also, demand, a, high, metabolism, during, human, evolution, the, body, mass, proportion, of, different, organs, changed, to, allow, brain, expansion, before, the, advent, of, fire, the, hominid, diet, was, limited, to, mostly, plant, parts, composed, of, simple, sugars, and, carbohydrates, such, as, seeds, flowers, and, fleshy, fruits, parts, of, the, plant, such, as, stems, mature, leaves, enlarged, roots, and, tubers, would, have, been, inaccessible, as, a, food, source, due, to, the, indigestibility, of, raw, cellulose, and, starch, cooking, however, made, starchy, and, fibrous, foods, edible, and, greatly, increased, the, diversity, of, other, foods, available, to, early, humans, toxin, containing, foods, including, seeds, and, similar, carbohydrate, sources, such, as, cyanogenic, glycosides, found, in, linseed, and, cassava, were, incorporated, into, their, diets, as, cooking, rendered, them, nontoxic, cooking, could, also, kill, parasites, reduce, the, amount, of, energy, required, for, chewing, and, digestion, and, release, more, nutrients, from, plants, and, meat, due, to, the, difficulty, of, chewing, raw, meat, and, digesting, tough, proteins, e, g, collagen, and, carbohydrates, the, development, of, cooking, served, as, an, effective, mechanism, to, efficiently, process, meat, and, allow, for, its, consumption, in, larger, quantities, with, its, high, caloric, density, and, content, of, important, nutrients, meat, thus, became, a, staple, in, the, diet, of, early, humans, by, increasing, digestibility, cooking, allowed, hominids, to, maximize, the, energy, gained, from, consuming, foods, studies, show, that, caloric, intake, from, cooking, starches, improves, 12, 35, and, 45, 78, for, protein, as, a, result, of, the, increases, in, net, energy, gain, from, food, consumption, survival, and, reproductive, rates, in, hominids, increased, through, lowering, food, toxicity, and, increasing, nutritive, yield, cooking, allowed, for, an, earlier, weaning, age, permitting, females, to, have, more, children, in, this, way, too, it, facilitated, population, growth, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, use, of, fire, for, cooking, caused, environmental, toxins, to, accumulate, in, the, placenta, which, led, to, a, species, wide, taboo, on, human, placentophagy, around, the, time, of, the, mastery, of, fire, placentophagy, is, common, in, other, primates, before, their, use, of, fire, the, hominid, species, had, large, premolars, which, were, used, to, chew, harder, foods, such, as, large, seeds, in, addition, due, to, the, shape, of, the, molar, cusps, the, diet, is, inferred, to, have, been, more, leaf, or, fruit, based, probably, in, response, to, consuming, cooked, foods, the, molar, teeth, of, h, erectus, gradually, shrank, suggesting, that, their, diet, had, changed, from, tougher, foods, such, as, crisp, root, vegetables, to, softer, cooked, foods, such, as, meat, cooked, foods, further, selected, for, the, differentiation, of, their, teeth, and, eventually, led, to, a, decreased, jaw, volume, with, a, variety, of, smaller, teeth, in, hominids, today, a, smaller, jaw, volume, and, teeth, size, of, humans, is, seen, in, comparison, to, other, primates, due, to, the, increased, digestibility, of, many, cooked, foods, less, digestion, was, needed, to, procure, the, necessary, nutrients, as, a, result, the, gastrointestinal, tract, and, organs, in, the, digestive, system, decreased, in, size, this, is, in, contrast, to, other, primates, where, a, larger, digestive, tract, is, needed, for, fermentation, of, long, carbohydrate, chains, thus, humans, evolved, from, the, large, colons, and, tracts, that, are, seen, in, other, primates, to, smaller, ones, according, to, wrangham, control, of, fire, allowed, hominids, to, sleep, on, the, ground, and, in, caves, instead, of, trees, and, led, to, more, time, being, spent, on, the, ground, this, may, have, contributed, to, the, evolution, of, bipedalism, as, such, an, ability, became, increasingly, necessary, for, human, activity, critics, of, the, hypothesis, argue, that, while, a, linear, increase, in, brain, volume, of, the, genus, homo, is, seen, over, time, adding, fire, control, and, cooking, does, not, add, anything, meaningful, to, the, data, species, such, as, h, ergaster, existed, with, large, brain, volumes, during, time, periods, with, little, to, no, evidence, of, fire, for, cooking, little, variation, exists, in, the, brain, sizes, of, h, erectus, dated, from, periods, of, weak, and, strong, evidence, for, cooking, an, experiment, involving, mice, fed, raw, versus, cooked, meat, found, that, cooking, meat, did, not, increase, the, amount, of, calories, taken, up, by, mice, leading, to, the, study, s, conclusion, that, the, energetic, gain, is, the, same, if, not, greater, in, raw, meat, diets, than, cooked, meats, studies, such, as, this, and, others, have, led, to, criticisms, of, the,
