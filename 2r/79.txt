begin, with, the, bronze, age, the, start, and, end, of, the, three, ages, vary, between, world, regions, in, many, regions, the, bronze, age, is, generally, considered, to, begin, a, few, centuries, prior, to, 3000, bc, while, the, end, of, the, iron, age, varies, from, the, early, first, millennium, bc, in, some, regions, to, the, late, first, millennium, ad, in, others, during, the, time, period, of, ancient, history, the, world, population, was, already, exponentially, increasing, due, to, the, neolithic, revolution, which, was, in, full, progress, while, in, 10, 000, bc, the, world, population, stood, at, 2, million, it, rose, to, 45, million, by, 3000, bc, by, the, iron, age, in, 1000, bc, the, population, had, risen, to, 72, million, by, the, end, of, the, ancient, period, in, ad, 500, the, world, population, is, thought, to, have, stood, at, 209, million, in, 10, 500, years, the, world, population, increased, by, 100, times, prehistory, is, the, period, before, written, history, most, of, our, knowledge, of, that, period, comes, from, the, work, of, archaeologists, prehistory, is, often, known, as, the, stone, age, and, is, divided, into, the, paleolithic, earliest, mesolithic, and, neolithic, the, early, human, migrations, in, the, lower, paleolithic, saw, homo, erectus, spread, across, eurasia, 1, 8, million, years, ago, evidence, for, the, use, of, fire, has, been, dated, as, early, as, 1, 8, million, years, ago, a, date, which, is, contested, with, generally, accepted, evidence, for, the, controlled, use, of, fire, dating, to, 780, 000, years, ago,

middle, to, lower, reaches, of, the, nile, river, reaching, its, greatest, extent, during, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, which, is, referred, to, as, the, new, kingdom, period, it, reached, broadly, from, the, nile, delta, in, the, north, as, far, south, as, jebel, barkal, at, the, fourth, cataract, of, the, nile, extensions, to, the, geographical, range, of, ancient, egyptian, civilisation, included, at, different, times, areas, of, the, southern, levant, the, eastern, desert, and, the, red, sea, coastline, the, sinai, peninsula, and, the, western, desert, focused, on, the, several, oases, ancient, egypt, developed, over, at, least, three, and, a, half, millennia, it, began, with, the, incipient, unification, of, nile, valley, polities, around, 3100, bc, traditionally, under, menes, the, civilisation, of, ancient, egypt, was, characterised, primarily, by, intensive, agricultural, use, of, the, fertile, nile, valley, the, use, of, the, nile, itself, for, transportation, the, development, of, writing, systems, first, hieroglyphs, and, then, later, hieratic, and, other, derived, scripts, and, literature, the, organisation, of, collective, projects, such, as, the, pyramids,

political, and, economic, elite, under, the, figure, of, a, semi, divine, ruler, from, a, succession, of, ruling, dynasties, ancient, egyptian, history, is, divided, across, various, periods, beginning, with, the, old, kingdom, which, saw, pyramid, building, on, a, large, scale, after, 2100, bc, the, old, kingdom, dissolved, into, smaller, states, during, the, first, intermediate, period, which, lasted, about, 100, years, the, middle, kingdom, began, around, 2000, bc, with, the, reunification, of, egypt, under, pharoes, ruling, from, thebes, the, middle, kingdom, ended, with, the, conquest, of, northern, egypt, by, the, hyksos, around, 1650, bc, the, hyksos, were, expelled, from, egypt, and, the, land, was, reunited, in, the, new, kingdom, around, 1550, bc, this, period, lasted, until, about, 1000, bc, and, saw, egypt, expand, its, borders, into, palestine, and, syria, the, third, intermediate, period, was, marked, by, the, rule, of, priests, as, well, as, the, conquest, of, egypt, by, nubian, kings, and, then, later, assyria, persia, and, macedonians, the, ta, seti, kingdom, in, nubia, to, the, south, of, egypt, was, conquered, by, egyptian, rulers, around, 3100, bc, but, by, 2500, bc, the, nubians, had, created, a, new, kingdom, further, south, known, as, the, kingdom, of, kush, centred, on, the, upper, nile, with, a, capital, at, kerma, in, the, egyptian, new, kingdom, period, kush, once, more, was, conquered, by, egypt, however, by, 1100, bc, a, new, kingdom, of, kush, had, formed, with, a, capital, at, napata, nubian, rulers, conquered, egypt, around, 760, bc, and, retained, control, for, about, a, century, the, kingdom, of, aksum, was, an, important, trading, nation, in, northeastern, africa, centered, in, present, day, eritrea, and, northern, ethiopia, it, existed, from, approximately, ad, 100, to, 940, growing, from, the, iron, age, proto, aksumite, period, around, the, 4th, century, bc, to, achieve, prominence, by, the, 1st, century, ad, the, kingdom, of, aksum, at, its, height, by, the, early, 6th, century, ad, extended, through, much, of, modern, ethiopia, and, across, the, red, sea, to, arabia, the, capital, city, of, the, empire, was, aksum, now, in, northern, ethiopia, the, nok, culture, appeared, in, nigeria, around, 1000, bc, and, mysteriously, vanished, around, ad, 200, the, civilisation, s, social, system, is, thought, to, have, been, highly, advanced, the, nok, civilisation, was, considered, to, be, the, earliest, sub, saharan, producer, of, life, sized, terracotta, which, have, been, discovered, by, archaeologists, the, nok, also, used, iron, smelting, that, may, have, been, independently, developed, the, civilisation, of, djenn, djenno, was, located, in, the, niger, river, valley, in, the, country, of, mali, and, is, considered, to, be, among, the, oldest, urbanized, centers, and, the, best, known, archaeology, site, in, sub, saharan, africa, this, archaeological, site, is, located, about, 3, kilometers, 1, 9, miles, away, from, the, modern, town, and, is, believed, to, have, been, involved, in, long, distance, trade, and, possibly, the, domestication, of, african, rice, the, site, is, believed, to, exceed, 33, hectares, 82, acres, however, this, is, yet, to, be, confirmed, with, extensive, survey, work, with, the, help, of, archaeological, excavations, mainly, by, susan, and, roderick, mcintosh, the, site, is, known, to, have, been, occupied, from, 250, bc, to, ad, 900, the, city, is, believed, to, have, been, abandoned, and, moved, where, the, current, city, is, located, due, to, the, spread, of, islam, and, the, building, of, the, great, mosque, of, djenn, previously, it, was, assumed, that, advanced, trade, networks, and, complex, societies, did, not, exist, in, the, region, until, the, arrival, of, traders, from, southwest, asia, however, sites, such, as, djenn, djenno, disprove, this, as, these, traditions, in, west, africa, flourished, long, before, towns, similar, to, that, at, djenne, jeno, also, developed, at, the, site, of, dia, also, in, mali, along, the, niger, river, from, around, 900, bc, dhar, tichitt, and, oualata, were, prominent, among, the, early, urban, centres, dated, to, 2000, bc, in, present, day, mauritania, about, 500, stone, settlements, littered, the, region, in, the, former, savannah, of, the, sahara, its, inhabitants, fished, and, grew, millet, it, has, been, found, that, the, soninke, of, the, mand, peoples, were, responsible, for, constructing, such, settlements, around, 300, bc, the, region, became, more, desiccated, and, the, settlements, began, to, decline, most, likely, relocating, to, koumbi, saleh, from, the, type, of, architecture, and, pottery, it, is, believed, that, tichit, was, related, to, the, subsequent, ghana, empire, old, jenne, djenne, began, to, be, settled, around, 300, bc, producing, iron, and, with, sizeable, population, evidenced, in, crowded, cemeteries, the, inhabitants, and, creators, of, these, settlements, during, these, periods, are, thought, to, have, been, ancestors, of, the, soninke, people, peoples, speaking, precursors, to, the, modern, day, bantu, languages, began, to, spread, throughout, southern, africa, and, by, 2000, bc, they, were, expanding, past, the, congo, river, and, into, the, great, lakes, area, by, ad, 1000, these, groups, had, spread,

population, that, produced, an, elaborate, bronze, age, industry, intensive, wet, rice, cultivation, in, an, ideal, climate, enabled, the, farming, communities, to, produce, a, regular, crop, surplus, that, was, used, by, the, ruling, elite, to, raise, command, and, pay, work, forces, for, public, construction, and, maintenance, projects, such, as, canals, and, fortifications, the, earliest, known, evidence, of, copper, and, bronze, production, in, southeast, asia, was, found, at, ban, chiang, in, north, east, thailand, and, among, the, ph, ng, nguy, n, culture, of, northern, vietnam, around, 2000, bce, the, ng, s, n, culture, established, a, tradition, of, bronze, production, and, the, manufacture, of, evermore, refined, bronze, and, iron, objects, such, as, plows, axes, and, sickles,

than, 70, kg, 150, lb, were, produced, in, the, laborious, lost, wax, casting, process, this, industry, of, highly, sophisticated, metal, processing, was, developed, independent, of, chinese, or, indian, influence, historians, relate, these, achievements, to, the, presence, of, organized, centralized, and, hierarchical, communities, and, a, large, population, between, 1000, bce, and, 100, ce, the, sa, hu, nh, culture, flourished, along, the, south, central, coast, of, vietnam, ceramic, jar, burial, sites, that, included, grave, goods, have, been, discovered, at, various, sites, along, the, entire, territory, among, large, thin, walled, terracotta, jars, ornamented, and, colorized, cooking, pots, glass, items, jade, earrings, and, metal, objects, were, deposited, near, the, rivers, and, along, the, coast, around, 3000, to, 1500, bce, a, large, scale, migration, of, austronesians, known, as, the, austronesian, expansion, began, from, taiwan, population, growth, primarily, fueled, this, migration, these, first, settlers, settled, in, northern, luzon, in, the, archipelago, of, the, philippines, intermingling, with, the, earlier, australo, melanesian, population, who, had, inhabited, the, islands, since, about, 23, 000, years, earlier, over, the, next, thousand, years, austronesian, peoples, migrated, southeast, to, the, rest, of, the, philippines, and, into, the, islands, of, the, celebes, sea, and, borneo, from, southwestern, borneo, austronesians, spread, further, west, in, a, single, migration, event, to, both, sumatra, and, the, coastal, regions, of, southern, vietnam, becoming, the, ancestors, of, the, speakers, of, the, malayic, and, chamic, branches, of, the, austronesian, language, family, soon, after, reaching, the, philippines, austronesians, colonized, the, northern, mariana, islands, by, 1500, bce, or, even, earlier, becoming, the, first, humans, to, reach, remote, oceania, the, chamorro, migration, was, also, unique, in, that, it, was, the, only, austronesian, migration, to, the, pacific, islands, to, successfully, retain, rice, cultivation, palau, and, yap, were, settled, by, separate, voyages, by, 1000, bce, another, important, migration, branch, was, by, the, lapita, culture, which, rapidly, spread, into, the, islands, off, the, coast, of, northern, new, guinea, and, into, the, solomon, islands, and, other, parts, of, coastal, new, guinea, and, island, melanesia, by, 1200, bce, they, reached, the, islands, of, fiji, samoa, and, tonga, by, around, 900, to, 800, bce, this, remained, the, furthest, extent, of, the, austronesian, expansion, into, polynesia, until, around, 700, ce, when, there, was, another, surge, of, island, colonization, it, reached, the, cook, islands, tahiti, and, the, marquesas, by, 700, ce, hawaii, by, 900, ce, rapa, nui, by, 1000, ce, and, new, zealand, by, 1200, ce, for, a, few, centuries, the, polynesian, islands, were, connected, by, bidirectional, long, distance, sailing, with, the, exception, of, rapa, nui, which, had, limited, further, contact, due, to, its, isolated, geographical, location, island, groups, like, the, pitcairns, the, kermadec, islands, and, the, norfolk, islands, were, also, formerly, settled, by, austronesians, but, later, abandoned, there, is, also, putative, evidence, based, in, the, spread, of, the, sweet, potato, that, austronesians, may, have, reached, south, america, from, polynesia, where, they, might, have, traded, with, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, austronesians, established, prehistoric, maritime, trade, networks, in, island, southeast, asia, including, the, maritime, jade, road, a, jade, trade, network, in, southeast, asia, which, existed, in, taiwan, and, the, philippines, for, 3, 000, years, from, 2000, bce, to, 1000, ce, the, trade, was, established, by, links, between, the, indigenous, peoples, of, taiwan, and, the, philippines, and, later, included, parts, of, vietnam, malaysia, indonesia, thailand, and, other, areas, in, southeast, asia, known, as, the, sa, huynh, kalanay, interaction, sphere, lingling, o, artifacts, are, one, of, the, notable, archeological, finds, originating, from, the, maritime, jade, road, during, the, operation, of, the, maritime, jade, road, the, austronesian, spice, trade, networks, were, also, established, by, islander, southeast, asians, with, sri, lanka, and, southern, india, by, around, 1000, to, 600, bce, they, also, established, early, long, distance, contacts, with, africa, possibly, as, early, as, before, 500, bce, based, on, archaeological, evidence, like, banana, phytoliths, in, cameroon, and, uganda, and, remains, of, neolithic, chicken, bones, in, zanzibar, an, austronesian, group, originally, from, the, makassar, strait, region, around, kalimantan, and, sulawesi, eventually, settled, madagascar, either, directly, from, southeast, asia, or, from, preexisting, mixed, austronesian, bantu, populations, from, east, africa, estimates, for, when, this, occurred, vary, from, the, 1st, century, ce, to, as, late, as, the, 6th, to, 7th, centuries, ce, it, is, likely, that, the, austronesians, that, settled, madagascar, followed, a, coastal, route, through, south, asia, and, east, africa, rather, than, directly, across, the, indian, ocean, genetic, evidence, suggests, that, some, individuals, of, austronesian, descent, reached, africa, and, the, arabian, peninsula, by, around, the, 2nd, century, bce, the, neolithic, austronesian, jade, and, spice, trade, networks, in, southeast, asia, connected, with, the, maritime, trade, routes, of, south, asia, the, middle, east, eastern, africa, and, the, mediterranean, becoming, what, is, now, known, as, the, maritime, silk, road, prior, to, the, 10th, century, the, eastern, part, of, the, route, was, primarily, used, by, southeast, asian, austronesian, traders, using, distinctive, lashed, lug, ships, although, tamil, and, persian, traders, also, sailed, the, western, parts, of, the, routes, it, allowed, the, exchange, of, goods, from, east, and, southeast, asia, on, one, end, all, the, way, to, europe, and, eastern, africa, on, the, other, srivijaya, an, austronesian, polity, founded, at, palembang, in, 682, ce, rose, to, dominate, the, trade, in, the, region, around, the, straits, of, malacca, and, sunda, and, the, south,

military, leaders, used, by, the, zhou, began, to, assert, their, power, and, vie, for, hegemony, the, situation, was, aggravated, by, the, invasion, of, other, peoples, forcing, the, zhou, to, move, their, capital, east, to, luoyang, in, each, of, the, hundreds, of, states, that, eventually, arose, local, strongmen, held, most, of, the, political, power, and, continued, their, subservience, to, the, zhou, kings, in, name, only, the, hundred, schools, of, thought, of, chinese, philosophy, blossomed, during, this, period, and, such, influential, intellectual, movements, as, confucianism, taoism, legalism, and, mohism, were, founded, partly, in, response, to, the, changing, political, world, after, further, political, consolidation, seven, prominent, states, remained, by, the, end, of, the, 5th, century, bc, and, the, years, in, which, these, few, states, battled, each, other, is, known, as, the, warring, states, period, though, there, remained, a, nominal, zhou, king, until, 256, bc, he, was, largely, a, figurehead, and, held, little, power, as, neighboring, territories, of, these, warring, states, including, areas, of, modern, sichuan, and, liaoning, were, annexed, by, the,

western, south, america, beyond, these, areas, the, use, of, agriculture, expanded, east, of, the, andes, mountains, in, south, america, particularly, with, the, marajoara, culture, and, in, the, continental, united, states, ancient, andean, civilisation, began, with, the, rise, of, organized, fishing, communities, from, 3500, bc, onwards, along, with, a, sophisticated, maritime, society, came, the, construction, of, large, monuments, which, likely, existed, as, community, centers, the, peoples, of, this, area, grew, beans, cotton, peanuts, and, sweet, potatoes, fished, in, the, ocean, and, by, about, 2000, bc, had, added, the, potato, to, their, crops, the, chavin, culture, based, around, the, chavin, cult, emerged, around, 1000, bc, and, led, to, large, temples, and, artworks, as, well, as, sophisticated, textiles, gold, silver, and, copper, were, worked, for, jewelry, and, occasionally, for, small, copper, tools, after, the, decline, of, chavin, culture, a, number, of, cities, formed, after, about, 200, bc, the, cities, at, huari, pucara, and, tiahuanaco, were, all, likely, over, 10, 000, residents, from, about, ad, 300, the, mochica, culture, arose, along, the, moche,

as, well, as, the, nazca, lines, a, large, number, of, huge, designs, set, into, the, desert, floor, agricultural, cultivation, began, around, 8000, bc, in, mesoamerica, where, avocados, beans, chili, peppers, gourds, and, squashes, were, grown, from, about, 7000, bc, around, 4000, bc, maize, began, to, be, grown, and, soon, after, this, tomatoes, settlements, appeared, around, 3000, bc, and, by, 2000, bc, most, of, mesoamerica, was, practicing, agriculture, although, some, animals, were, domesticated, notably, turkeys, and, dogs, the, lack, of, suitable, large, animals, precluded, the, development, of, animals, used, for, transportation, or, labour, around, 1200, bc, the, first, olmec, center, of, san, lorenzo, was, founded, which, remained, the, centre, of, olmec, civilisation, until, around, 800, bc, when, la, venta, took, over, before, losing, primacy, to, tres, zapotes, around, 400, bc, these, and, other, olmec, centres, were, groups, of, tombs, temples, and, other, ceremonial, sites, built, of, stone, their, construction, testifies, to, the, complexity, of, olmec, society, although, the, exact, nature, of, how, they, were, governed, is, not, known, they, also, erected, large, stone, sculptures, of, human, heads, and, other, subjects, jade, jewelry, and, other, olmec, objects, are, found, throughout, mesoamerica, likely, having, travelled, via, trade, networks, the, olmec, writing, system, was, mainly, used, for, recording, their, calendar, both, of, which, influenced, later, mesoamerican, cultures, after, the, decline, of, the, olmecs, other, civilisations, in, mesoamerica, either, arose, or, emerged, from, the, olmec, shadow, the, mayans, the, zapotecs, and, teotihuacan, the, zapotecs, began, around, 500, bc, in, the, oaxaca, valley, at, the, site, of, monte, alban, monte, alban, grew, to, around, 25, 000, residents, in, the, period, around, ad, 200, with, the, city, having, large, stone, temples, and, an, expansive, stone, plaza, like, the, olmecs, they, had, a, writing, system, and, calendar, but, by, ad, 900, monte, alban, was, deserted, for, unknown, reasons, teotihuacan, developed, around, ad, 200, and, centred, on, the, city, of, teotihuacan, which, grew, to, perhaps, as, many, as, 200, 000, inhabitants, at, its, height, teotihuacan, lasted, until, around, ad, 700, when, it, was, burned, and, vandalized, maya,

built, with, temples, pyramids, and, palaces, the, focal, point, of, each, centre, the, most, influential, was, tikal, but, mayan, civilisation, was, based, on, city, states, which, often, were, at, war, with, each, other, this, seems, not, to, have, restricted, trade, which, went, on, between, the, cities, a, priestly, elite, kept, astronomical, and, calendrical, knowledge, recording, it, with, a, writing, system, based, on, the, olmec, system, of, glyphs, history, poetry, and, other, records, were, recorded, in, books, most, of, which, did, not, survive, the, spanish, conquest, of, mesoamerica, mathematics, was, also, studied, and, they, used, the, concept, of, zero, in, their, calculations, the, mayan, civilisation, began, to, decline, about, ad, 800, and, most, of, its,
