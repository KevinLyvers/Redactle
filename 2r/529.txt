of, bangladesh, on, 26, march, 1971, most, bengalis, supported, this, move, although, some, islamists, and, biharis, opposed, it, and, sided, with, the, pakistan, army, instead, pakistani, president,

european, languages, bengali, speakers, constituted, over, 56, of, pakistan, s, population, the, government, stand, was, widely, viewed, as, an, attempt, to, suppress, the, culture, of, the, eastern, wing, the, people, of, east, bengal, demanded, that, their, language, be, given, federal, status, alongside, urdu, and, english, the, language, movement, began, in, 1948, as, civil, society, protested, the, removal, of, bengali, script, from, currency, and, stamps, which, were, in, place, since, the, british, raj, the, movement, reached, its, climax, in, 1952, when, on, 21, february, the, police, fired, on, protesting, students, and, civilians, causing, several, deaths, the, day, is, revered, in, bangladesh, as, the, language, movement, day, in, memory, of, the, deaths, unesco,

and, received, more, money, from, the, common, budget, east, pakistan, was, already, economically, disadvantaged, at, the, time, of, pakistan, s, creation, yet, this, economic, disparity, only, increased, under, pakistani, rule, factors, included, not, only, the, deliberate, state, discrimination, in, developmental, policies, but, also, the, fact, that, the, presence, of, the, country, s, capital, and, more, immigrant, businessmen, in, the, western, wing, directed, greater, government, allocations, there, due, to, low, numbers, of, native, businessmen, in, east, pakistan, substantial, labour, unrest, and, a, tense, political, environment, there, were, also, much, lower, foreign, investments, in, the, eastern, wing, the, pakistani, state, s, economic, outlook, was, geared, towards, urban, industry, which, was, not, compatible, with, east, pakistan, s, mainly, agrarian, economy, also, bengalis, were, underrepresented, in, the, pakistani, military, officers, of, bengali, origin, in, the, different, wings, of, the, armed, forces, made, up, just, 5, of, the, overall, force, by, 1965, of, these, only, a, few, were, in, command, positions, with, the, majority, in, technical, or, administrative, posts, west, pakistanis, believed, that, bengalis, were, not, martially, inclined, unlike, pashtuns, and, punjabis, bengalis, dismissed, the, martial, races, notion, as, ridiculous, and, humiliating, moreover, despite, huge, defence, spending, east, pakistan, received, none, of, the, benefits, such, as, contracts, purchasing, and, military, support, jobs, the, indo, pakistani, war, of, 1965, over, kashmir, also, highlighted, the, sense, of, military, insecurity, among, bengalis, as, only, an, under, strength, infantry, division, and, 15, combat, aircraft, without, tank, support, were, in, east, pakistan, to, repulse, any, indian, retaliations, during, the, conflict, in, 1947, the, bengali, muslims, had, identified, themselves, with, pakistan, s, islamic, project, but, by, the, 1970s, the, people, of, east, pakistan, had, given, priority, to, their, bengali, ethnicity, over, their, religious, identity, desiring, a, society, in, accordance, with, western, principles, such, as, secularism, democracy, and, socialism, many, bengali, muslims, strongly, objected, to, the, islamist, paradigm, the, pakistani, state, imposed, most, members, of, west, pakistan, s, ruling, elite, shared, a, vision, of, a, liberal, society, but, nevertheless, viewed, a, common, faith, as, an, essential, mobilising, factor, behind, pakistan, s, creation, and, the, subsuming, of, pakistan, s, multiple, regional, identities, into, one, national, identity, west, pakistanis, were, substantially, more, supportive, than, east, pakistanis, of, an, islamic, state, a, tendency, that, persisted, after, 1971, cultural, and, linguistic, differences, between, the, two, wings, gradually, outweighed, any, sense, of, religious, unity, the, bengalis, took, great, pride, in, their, culture, and, language, which, with, its, bengali, script, and, vocabulary, was, unacceptable, to, the, west, pakistani, elite, who, believed, that, it, had, assimilated, considerable, hindu, cultural, influences, west, pakistanis, in, an, attempt, to, islamise, the, east, wanted, the, bengalis, to, adopt, urdu, the, activities, of, the, language, movement, nurtured, a, sentiment, among, bengalis, in, favour, of, discarding, pakistan, s, communalism, in, favour, of, secular, politics, the, awami, league, began, propagating, its, secular, message, through, its, newspaper, to, the, bengali, readership, the, awami, league, s, emphasis, on, secularism, differentiated, it, from, the, muslim, league, in, 1971, the, bangladeshi, liberation, struggle, against, pakistan, was, led, by, secular, leaders, and, secularists, hailed, the, bangladeshi, victory, as, the, triumph, of, secular, bengali, nationalism, over, religion, centred, pakistani, nationalism, while, pakistan, s, government, strives, for, an, islamic, state, bangladesh, was, established, secular, after, the, liberation, victory, the, awami, league, attempted, to, build, a, secular, order, and, the, pro, pakistan, islamist, parties, were, barred, from, political, participation, the, majority, of, east, pakistani, ulama, had, either, remained, neutral, or, supported, the, pakistani, state, since, they, felt, that, the, break, up, of, pakistan, would, be, detrimental, for, islam, although, east, pakistan, accounted, for, a, slight, majority, of, the, country, s, population, political, power, remained, in, the, hands, of, west, pakistanis, since, a, straightforward, system, of, representation, based, on, population, would, have, concentrated, political, power, in, east, pakistan, the, west, pakistani, establishment, came, up, with, the, one, unit, scheme, whereby, all, of, west, pakistan, was, considered, one, province, this, was, solely, to, counterbalance, the, east, wing, s, votes, after, the, 1951, assassination, of, liaquat, ali, khan, pakistan, s, first, prime, minister, political, power, began, to, devolve, to, the, new, position, of, president, of, pakistan, which, replaced, the, office, of, governor, general, when, pakistan, became, a, republic, and, eventually, the, military, the, nominal, elected, chief, executive, the, prime, minister, was, frequently, sacked, by, the, establishment, acting, through, the, president, the, east, pakistanis, observed, that, the, west, pakistani, establishment, swiftly, deposed, any, east, pakistanis, elected, leader, of, pakistan, such, as, khawaja, nazimuddin, mohammad, ali, bogra, huseyn, shaheed, suhrawardy, and, iskander, mirza, their, suspicions, were, further, aggravated, by, the, military, dictatorships, of, ayub, khan, 27, october, 1958, 25, march, 1969, and, yahya, khan, 25, march, 1969, 20, december, 1971, both, west, pakistanis, the, situation, reached, a, climax, in, 1970, when, the, bangladesh, awami, league, the, largest, east, pakistani, political, party, led, by, sheikh, mujibur, rahman, won, a, landslide, victory, in, the, national, elections, the, party, won, 167, of, the, 169, seats, allotted, to, east, pakistan, and, thus, a, majority, of, the, 313, seats, in, the, national, assembly, this, gave, the, awami, league, the, constitutional, right, to, form, a, government, however, zulfikar, ali, bhutto, a, former, foreign, minister, the, leader, of, the, pakistan, people, s, party, refused, to, allow, rahman, to, become, the, prime, minister, of, pakistan, instead, he, proposed, the, idea, of, having, two, prime, ministers, one, for, each, wing, the, proposal, elicited, outrage, in, the, east, wing, already, chafing, under, the, other, constitutional, innovation, the, one, unit, scheme, bhutto, also, refused, to, accept, rahman, s, six, points, on, 3, march, 1971, the, two, leaders, of, the, two, wings, along, with, the, president, general, yahya, khan, met, in, dacca, to, decide, the, fate, of, the, country, after, their, discussions, yielded, no, satisfactory, results, sheikh, mujibur, rahman, called, for, a, nationwide, strike, bhutto, feared, a, civil, war, therefore, he, sent, his, trusted, companion, mubashir, hassan, a, message, was, conveyed, and, rahman, decided, to, meet, bhutto, upon, his, arrival, rahman, met, with, bhutto, and, both, agreed, to, form, a, coalition, government, with, rahman, as, premier, and, bhutto, as, president, but, sheikh, mujib, later, ruled, out, such, a, possibility, meanwhile, the, military, was, unaware, of, these, developments, and, bhutto, increased, his, pressure, on, rahman, to, reach, a, decision, on, 7, march, 1971, sheikh, mujibur, rahman, soon, to, be, prime, minister, delivered, a, speech, at, the, racecourse, ground, now, the, suhrawardy, udyan, in, this, speech, he, mentioned, a, further, four, point, condition, to, consider, at, the, national, assembly, meeting, on, 25, march, he, urged, his, people, to, turn, every, house, into, a, fort, of, resistance, he, closed, his, speech, saying, our, struggle, is, for, our, freedom, our, struggle, is, for, our, independence, this,

crumble, if, pakistanis, perceived, the, accord, as, overly, harsh, reaction, to, the, defeat, and, dismemberment, of, half, the, nation, was, a, shocking, loss, to, top, military, and, civilians,

which, nixon, had, been, negotiating, a, rapprochement, and, which, he, intended, to, visit, in, february, 1972, nixon, feared, that, an, indian, invasion, of, west, pakistan, would, mean, total, soviet, domination, of, the, region, and, that, it, would, seriously, undermine, the, global, position, of, the, united, states, and, the, regional, position, of, america, s, new, tacit, ally, china,

reports, it, received, of, the, genocidal, activities, of, the, pakistani, army, in, east, pakistan, most, notably, the, blood, telegram, nixon, denied, getting, involved, in, the, situation, saying, that, it, was, an, internal, matter, of, pakistan, but, when, pakistan, s, defeat, seemed, certain, he, sent, the, aircraft, carrier, uss, enterprise, to, the, bay, of, bengal, a, move, the, indians,

china, it, gave, assurances, to, india, that, if, a, confrontation, with, the, u, s, or, china, developed, the, ussr, would, take, countermeasures, this, was, enshrined, in, the, indo, soviet, friendship, treaty, signed, in, august, 1971, the, soviets, also, sent, a, nuclear, submarine, to, ward, off, the, threat, posed, by, uss, enterprise, in, the, indian, ocean, at, the, end, of, the, war, the, warsaw, pact, countries, were, among, the, first, to, recognise, bangladesh, the, soviet, union, accorded, recognition, to, bangladesh, on, 25, january, 1972, the, united, states, delayed,

chinese, to, move, some, forces, toward, the, frontier, with, india, nixon, said, threaten, to, move, forces, or, move, them, henry, that, s, what, they, must, do, now, kissinger, met, with, huang, hua, china, s, permanent, representative, to, the, united, nations, later, that, evening, the, chinese, did, not, respond, to, this, encouragement, because, unlike, the, 1962, sino, indian, war, when, india, was, caught, entirely, unaware, this, time, the, indian, army, was, prepared, and, had, deployed, eight, mountain, divisions, to, the, sino, indian, border, to, guard, against, such, an, eventuality, china, instead, threw, its, weight, behind, demands, for, an, immediate, ceasefire, when, bangladesh, applied, for, membership, to, the, united, nations, in, 1972, china, vetoed, its, application, because, two, u, n, resolutions, about, the, repatriation, of, pakistani, prisoners, of, war, and, civilians, had, not, yet, been, implemented, china, was, also, among, the, last, countries, to, recognise, independent, bangladesh, refusing, to, do, so, until, 31, august, 1975, sri, lanka, then, called, ceylon, saw, the, partition, of, pakistan, as, an, example, for, itself, and, feared, india, might, use, its, enhanced, power, against, it, in, the, future, 7, despite, the, left, wing, government, of, sirimavo, bandaranaike, following, a, neutral, non, aligned, foreign, policy, sri, lanka, decided, to, help, pakistan, in, the, war, as, pakistani, aircraft, could, not, fly, over, indian, territory, they, would, have, to, take, a, longer, route, around, india, and, so, they, stopped, at, bandaranaike, airport, in, sri, lanka, where, they, were, refuelled, before, flying, to, east, pakistan, as, many, arab, countries, were, allied, with, both, the, united, states, and, pakistan, it, was, easy, for, kissinger, to, encourage, them, to, participate, he, sent, letters, to, both, the, king, of, jordan, and, the, king, of, saudi, arabia, nixon, gave, permission, for, jordan, to, send, ten, f, 104s, and, promised, to, provide, replacements, according, to, author, martin, bowman, libyan, f, 5s, were, reportedly, deployed, to, sargodha, afb, perhaps, as, a,
