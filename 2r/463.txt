second, sino, japanese, war, on, 6, and, 9, august, 1945, the, united, states, detonated, two, atomic, bombs, over, the, japanese, cities, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, the, bombings, killed, between, 150, 000, and, 246, 000, people, most, of, whom, were, civilians, and, remain, the, only, use, of, nuclear, weapons, in, an, armed, conflict, japan, surrendered, to, the, allies, on, 15, august, six, days, after, the, bombing, of, nagasaki, and, the, soviet, union, s, declaration, of, war, against, japan, and, invasion, of, japanese, occupied, manchuria, the, japanese, government, signed, the, instrument, of, surrender, on, 2, september, effectively, ending, the, war, in, the, final, year, of, world, war, ii, the, allies, prepared, for, a, costly, invasion, of, the, japanese, mainland, this, undertaking, was, preceded, by, a, conventional, bombing, and, firebombing, campaign, that, devastated, 64, japanese, cities, the, war, in, the, european, theatre, concluded, when, germany, surrendered, on, 8, may, 1945, and, the, allies, turned, their, full, attention, to, the, pacific, war, by, july, 1945, the, allies, manhattan, project, had, produced, two, types, of, atomic, bombs, little, boy, an, enriched, uranium, gun, type, fission, weapon, and, fat, man, a, plutonium, implosion, type, nuclear, weapon, the, 509th, composite, group, of, the, united, states, army, air, forces, was, trained, and, equipped, with, the, specialized, silverplate, version, of, the, boeing, b, 29, superfortress, and, deployed, to, tinian, in, the, mariana, islands, the, allies, called, for, the, unconditional, surrender, of, the, imperial, japanese, armed, forces, in, the, potsdam, declaration, on, 26, july, 1945, the, alternative, being, prompt, and, utter, destruction, the, japanese, government, ignored, the, ultimatum, the, consent, of, the, united, kingdom, was, obtained, for, the, bombing, as, was, required, by, the, quebec, agreement, and, orders, were, issued, on, 25, july, by, general, thomas, handy, the, acting, chief, of, staff, of, the, united, states, army, for, atomic, bombs, to, be, used, against, hiroshima, kokura, niigata, and, nagasaki, these, targets, were, chosen, because, they, were, large, urban, areas, that, also, held, militarily, significant, facilities, on, 6, august, a, little, boy, was, dropped, on, hiroshima, three, days, later, a, fat, man, was, dropped, on, nagasaki, over, the, next, two, to, four, months, the, effects, of, the, atomic, bombings, killed, 90, 000, to, 166, 000, people, in, hiroshima, and, 60, 000, to, 80, 000, people, in, nagasaki, roughly, half, occurred, on, the, first, day, for, months, afterward, many, people, continued, to, die, from, the, effects, of, burns, radiation, sickness, and, other, injuries, compounded, by, illness, and, malnutrition, though, hiroshima, had, a, sizable, military, garrison, most, of, the, dead, were, civilians, scholars, have, extensively, studied, the, effects, of, the, bombings, on, the, social, and, political, character, of, subsequent, world, history, and, popular, culture, and, there, is, still, much, debate, concerning, the, ethical, and, legal, justification, for, the, bombings, according, to, supporters, the, atomic, bombings, were, necessary, to, bring, an, end, to, the, war, with, minimal, casualties, and, ultimately, prevented, a, greater, loss, of, life, according, to, critics, the, bombings, were, unnecessary, for, the, war, s, end, and, were, a, war, crime, raising, moral, and, ethical, implications, in, 1945, the, pacific, war, between, the, empire, of, japan, and, the, allies, entered, its, fourth, year, most, japanese, military, units, fought, fiercely, ensuring, that, the, allied, victory, would, come, at, an, enormous, cost, the, 1, 25, million, battle, casualties, incurred, in, total, by, the, united, states, in, world, war, ii, included, both, military, personnel, killed, in, action, and, wounded, in, action, nearly, one, million, of, the, casualties, occurred, during, the, last, year, of, the, war, from, june, 1944, to, june, 1945, in, december, 1944, american, battle, casualties, hit, an, all, time, monthly, high, of, 88, 000, as, a, result, of, the, german, ardennes, offensive, worried, by, the, losses, sustained, president, roosevelt, suggested, the, use, of, atomic, bombs, on, germany, as, soon, as, possible, but, was, informed, the, first, usable, atomic, weapons, were, still, months, away, america, s, reserves, of, manpower, were, running, out, deferments, for, groups, such, as, agricultural, workers, were, tightened, and, there, was, consideration, of, drafting, women, at, the, same, time, the, public, was, becoming, war, weary, and, demanding, that, long, serving, servicemen, be, sent, home, in, the, pacific, the, allies, returned, to, the, philippines, recaptured, burma, and, invaded, borneo, offensives, were, undertaken, to, reduce, the, japanese, forces, remaining, in, bougainville, new, guinea, and, the, philippines, in, april, 1945, american, forces, landed, on, okinawa, where, heavy, fighting, continued, until, june, along, the, way, the, ratio, of, japanese, to, american, casualties, dropped, from, five, to, one, in, the, philippines, to, two, to, one, on, okinawa, although, some, japanese, soldiers, were, taken, prisoner, most, fought, until, they, were, killed, or, committed, suicide, nearly, 99, percent, of, the, 21, 000, defenders, of, iwo, jima, were, killed, of, the, 117, 000, okinawan, and, japanese, troops, defending, okinawa, in, april, to, june, 1945, 94, percent, were, killed, 7, 401, japanese, soldiers, surrendered, an, unprecedentedly, large, number, as, the, allies, advanced, towards, japan, conditions, became, steadily, worse, for, the, japanese, people, japan, s, merchant, fleet, declined, from, 5, 250, 000, gross, register, tons, in, 1941, to, 1, 560, 000, tons, in, march, 1945, and, 557, 000, tons, in, august, 1945, the, lack, of, raw, materials, forced, the, japanese, war, economy, into, a, steep, decline, after, the, middle, of, 1944, the, civilian, economy, which, had, slowly, deteriorated, throughout, the, war, reached, disastrous, levels, by, the, middle, of, 1945, the, loss, of, shipping, also, affected, the, fishing, fleet, and, the, 1945, catch, was, only, 22, percent, of, that, in, 1941, the, 1945, rice, harvest, was, the, worst, since, 1909, and, hunger, and, malnutrition, became, widespread, u, s, industrial, production, was, overwhelmingly, superior, to, japan, s, by, 1943, the, u, s, produced, almost, 100, 000, aircraft, a, year, compared, to, japan, s, production, of, 70, 000, for, the, entire, war, in, february, 1945, prince, fumimaro, konoe, advised, emperor, hirohito, that, defeat, was, inevitable, and, urged, him, to, abdicate, even, before, the, surrender, of, nazi, germany, on, 8, may, 1945, plans, were, underway, for, the, largest, operation, of, the, pacific, war, operation, downfall, the, allied, invasion, of, japan, the, operation, had, two, parts, set, to, begin, in, october, 1945, operation, olympic, involved, a, series, of, landings, by, the, u, s, sixth, army, intended, to, capture, the, southern, third, of, the, southernmost, main, japanese, island, ky, sh, this, was, to, be, followed, in, march, 1946, by, operation, coronet, the, capture, of, the, kant, plain, near, tokyo, on, the, main, japanese, island, of, honsh, by, the, u, s, first, eighth, and, tenth, armies, as, well, as, a, commonwealth, corps, made, up, of, australian, british, and, canadian, divisions, the, target, date, was, chosen, to, allow, for, olympic, to, complete, its, objectives, for, troops, to, be, redeployed, from, europe, and, the, japanese, winter, to, pass, japan, s, geography, made, this, invasion, plan, obvious, to, the, japanese, they, were, able, to, predict, the, allied, invasion, plans, accurately, and, thus, adjust, their, defensive, plan, operation, ketsug, accordingly, the, japanese, planned, an, all, out, defense, of, ky, sh, with, little, left, in, reserve, in, all, there, were, 2, 3, million, japanese, army, troops, prepared, to, defend, the, home, islands, backed, by, a, civilian, militia, of, 28, million, casualty, predictions, varied, widely, but, were, extremely, high, the, vice, chief, of, the, imperial, japanese, navy, general, staff, vice, admiral, takijir, nishi, predicted, up, to, 20, million, japanese, deaths, the, americans, were, alarmed, by, the, japanese, buildup, which, was, accurately, tracked, through, ultra, intelligence, on, 15, june, 1945, a, study, by, the, joint, war, plans, committee, drawing, on, the, experience, of, the, battle, of, leyte, estimated, that, downfall, would, result, in, 132, 500, to, 220, 000, u, s, casualties, with, u, s, dead, and, missing, in, the, range, from, 27, 500, to, 50, 000, secretary, of, war, henry, l, stimson, commissioned, his, own, study, by, quincy, wright, and, william, shockley, who, estimated, the, invading, allies, would, suffer, between, 1, 7, and, 4, million, casualties, of, whom, between, 400, 000, and, 800, 000, would, be, dead, while, japanese, fatalities, would, have, been, around, 5, to, 10, million, in, a, meeting, with, the, president, and, commanders, on, june, 18, 1945, general, george, c, marshall, stated, that, there, was, reason, to, believe, casualties, for, the, first, 30, days, would, not, exceed, the, price, paid, for, luzon, additionally, with, the, japanese, position, rendered, hopeless, by, an, invasion, of, their, mainland, marshall, speculated, that, soviet, entry, into, the, war, might, be, the, decisive, action, needed, to, finally, them, into, capitulation, marshall, began, contemplating, the, use, of, a, weapon, that, was, readily, available, and, which, assuredly, can, decrease, the, cost, in, american, lives, poison, gas, quantities, of, phosgene, mustard, gas, tear, gas, and, cyanogen, chloride, were, moved, to, luzon, from, stockpiles, in, australia, and, new, guinea, in, preparation, for, operation, olympic, and, macarthur, ensured, that, chemical, warfare, service, units, were, trained, in, their, use, consideration, was, also, given, to, using, biological, weapons, while, the, united, states, had, developed, plans, for, an, air, campaign, against, japan, prior, to, the, pacific, war, the, capture, of, allied, bases, in, the, western, pacific, in, the, first, weeks, of, the, conflict, meant, that, this, offensive, did, not, begin, until, mid, 1944, when, the, long, ranged, boeing, b, 29, superfortress, became, ready, for, use, in, combat, operation, matterhorn, involved, india, based, b, 29s, staging, through, bases, around, chengdu, in, china, to, make, a, series, of, raids, on, strategic, targets, in, japan, this, effort, failed, to, achieve, the, strategic, objectives, that, its, planners, had, intended, largely, because, of, logistical, problems, the, bomber, s, mechanical, difficulties, the, vulnerability, of, chinese, staging, bases, and, the, extreme, range, required, to, reach, key, japanese, cities, brigadier, general, haywood, s, hansell, determined, that, guam, tinian, and, saipan, in, the, mariana, islands, would, better, serve, as, b, 29, bases, but, they, were, in, japanese, hands, strategies, were, shifted, to, accommodate, the, air, war, and, the, islands, were, captured, between, june, and, august, 1944, air, bases, were, developed, and, b, 29, operations, commenced, from, the, marianas, in, october, 1944, the, xxi, bomber, command, began, missions, against, japan, on, 18, november, 1944, the, early, attempts, to, bomb, japan, from, the, marianas, proved, just, as, ineffective, as, the, china, based, b, 29s, had, been, hansell, continued, the, practice, of, conducting, so, called, high, altitude, precision, bombing, aimed, at, key, industries, and, transportation, networks, even, after, these, tactics, had, not, produced, acceptable, results, these, efforts, proved, unsuccessful, due, to, logistical, difficulties, with, the, remote, location, technical, problems, with, the, new, and, advanced, aircraft, unfavorable, weather, conditions, and, enemy, action, hansell, s, successor, major, general, curtis, lemay, assumed, command, in, january, 1945, and, initially, continued, to, use, the, same, precision, bombing, tactics, with, equally, unsatisfactory, results, the, attacks, initially, targeted, key, industrial, facilities, but, much, of, the, japanese, manufacturing, process, was, carried, out, in, small, workshops, and, private, homes, under, pressure, from, united, states, army, air, forces, usaaf, headquarters, in, washington, lemay, changed, tactics, and, decided, that, low, level, incendiary, raids, against, japanese, cities, were, the, only, way, to, destroy, their, production, capabilities, shifting, from, precision, bombing, to, area, bombardment, with, incendiaries, like, most, strategic, bombing, during, world, war, ii, the, aim, of, the, air, offensive, against, japan, was, to, destroy, the, enemy, s, war, industries, kill, or, disable, civilian, employees, of, these, industries, and, undermine, civilian, morale, over, the, next, six, months, the, xxi, bomber, command, under, lemay, firebombed, 64, japanese, cities, the, firebombing, of, tokyo, codenamed, operation, meetinghouse, on, 9, 10, march, killed, an, estimated, 100, 000, people, and, destroyed, 41, km, 2, 16, sq, mi, of, the, city, and, 267, 000, buildings, in, a, single, night, it, was, the, deadliest, bombing, raid, of, the, war, at, a, cost, of, 20, b, 29s, shot, down, by, flak, and, fighters, by, may, 75, percent, of, bombs, dropped, were, incendiaries, designed, to, burn, down, japan, s, paper, cities, by, mid, june, japan, s, six, largest, cities, had, been, devastated, the, end, of, the, fighting, on, okinawa, that, month, provided, airfields, even, closer, to, the, japanese, mainland, allowing, the, bombing, campaign, to, be, further, escalated, aircraft, flying, from, allied, aircraft, carriers, and, the, ryukyu, islands, also, regularly, struck, targets, in, japan, during, 1945, in, preparation, for, operation, downfall, firebombing, switched, to, smaller, cities, with, populations, ranging, from, 60, 000, to, 350, 000, according, to, yuki, tanaka, the, u, s, fire, bombed, over, a, hundred, japanese, towns, and, cities, the, japanese, military, was, unable, to, stop, the, allied, attacks, and, the, country, s, civil, defense, preparations, proved, inadequate, japanese, fighters, and, anti, aircraft, guns, had, difficulty, engaging, bombers, flying, at, high, altitude, from, april, 1945, the, japanese, interceptors, also, had, to, face, american, fighter, escorts, based, on, iwo, jima, and, okinawa, that, month, the, imperial, japanese, army, air, service, and, imperial, japanese, navy, air, service, stopped, attempting, to, intercept, the, air, raids, to, preserve, fighter, aircraft, to, counter, the, expected, invasion, by, mid, 1945, the, japanese, only, occasionally, scrambled, aircraft, to, intercept, individual, b, 29s, conducting, reconnaissance, sorties, over, the, country, to, conserve, supplies, of, fuel, in, july, 1945, the, japanese, had, 137, 800, 000, litres, 1, 156, 000, us, bbl, of, avgas, stockpiled, for, the, invasion, of, japan, about, 72, 000, 000, litres, 604, 000, us, bbl, had, been, consumed, in, the, home, islands, area, in, april, may, and, june, 1945, while, the, japanese, military, decided, to, resume, attacks, on, allied, bombers, from, late, june, by, this, time, there, were, too, few, operational, fighters, available, for, this, change, of, tactics, to, hinder, the, allied, air, raids, the, discovery, of, nuclear, fission, in, 1938, made, the, development, of, an, atomic, bomb, a, theoretical, possibility, fears, that, a, german, atomic, bomb, project, would, develop, atomic, weapons, first, especially, among, scientists, who, were, refugees, from, nazi, germany, and, other, fascist, countries, were, expressed, in, the, einstein, szilard, letter, to, roosevelt, in, 1939, this, prompted, preliminary, research, in, the, united, states, in, late, 1939, progress, was, slow, until, the, arrival, of, the, british, maud, committee, report, in, late, 1941, which, indicated, that, only, 5, to, 10, kilograms, of, isotopically, pure, uranium, 235, were, needed, for, a, bomb, instead, of, tons, of, natural, uranium, and, a, neutron, moderator, like, heavy, water, consequently, the, work, was, accelerated, first, as, a, pilot, program, and, finally, in, the, agreement, by, roosevelt, to, turn, the, work, over, to, the, u, s, army, corps, of, engineers, to, construct, the, production, facilities, necessary, to, produce, uranium, 235, and, plutonium, 239, this, work, was, consolidated, within, the, newly, created, manhattan, engineer, district, which, became, better, known, as, the, manhattan, project, eventually, under, the, direction, of, major, general, leslie, r, groves, jr, the, work, of, the, manhattan, project, took, place, at, dozens, of, sites, across, the, united, states, and, even, some, outside, of, its, borders, it, would, ultimately, cost, over, us, 2, billion, equivalent, to, about, 27, billion, in, 2023, and, employ, over, 125, 000, people, simultaneously, at, its, peak, groves, appointed, j, robert, oppenheimer, to, organize, and, head, the, project, s, los, alamos, laboratory, in, new, mexico, where, bomb, design, work, was, carried, out, two, different, types, of, bombs, were, eventually, developed, a, gun, type, fission, weapon, that, used, uranium, 235, called, little, boy, and, a, more, complex, implosion, type, nuclear, weapon, that, used, plutonium, 239, called, fat, man, there, was, a, japanese, nuclear, weapon, program, but, it, lacked, the, human, mineral, and, financial, resources, of, the, manhattan, project, and, never, made, much, progress, towards, developing, an, atomic, bomb, the, 509th, composite, group, was, constituted, on, 9, december, 1944, and, activated, on, 17, december, 1944, at, wendover, army, air, field, utah, commanded, by, colonel, paul, tibbets, tibbets, was, assigned, to, organize, and, command, a, combat, group, to, develop, the, means, of, delivering, an, atomic, weapon, against, targets, in, germany, and, japan, because, the, flying, squadrons, of, the, group, consisted, of, both, bomber, and, transport, aircraft, the, group, was, designated, as, a, composite, rather, than, a, bombardment, unit, due, to, its, remoteness, tibbets, selected, wendover, for, his, training, base, over, great, bend, kansas, and, mountain, home, idaho, each, bombardier, completed, at, least, 50, practice, drops, of, inert, or, conventional, explosive, pumpkin, bombs, targeting, islands, around, tinian, and, later, the, japanese, home, islands, until, as, late, as, august, 14, 1945, some, of, the, missions, over, japan, were, flown, by, single, unescorted, bombers, with, a, single, payload, to, accustom, the, japanese, to, this, pattern, they, also, simulated, actual, atomic, bombing, runs, including, the, directions, of, ingress, and, egress, with, respect, to, the, wind, tibbets, himself, was, barred, from, flying, most, missions, over, japan, for, fear, that, he, might, be, captured, and, interrogated, on, 5, april, 1945, the, code, name, operation, centerboard, was, assigned, the, officer, responsible, for, its, allocation, in, the, war, department, s, operations, division, was, not, cleared, to, know, any, details, of, it, the, first, bombing, was, later, codenamed, operation, centerboard, i, and, the, second, operation, centerboard, ii, the, 509th, composite, group, had, an, authorized, strength, of, 225, officers, and, 1, 542, enlisted, men, almost, all, of, whom, eventually, deployed, to, tinian, in, addition, to, its, authorized, strength, the, 509th, had, attached, to, it, on, tinian, 51, civilian, and, military, personnel, from, project, alberta, known, as, the, 1st, technical, detachment, the, 509th, composite, group, s, 393d, bombardment, squadron, was, equipped, with, 15, silverplate, b, 29s, these, aircraft, were, specially, adapted, to, carry, nuclear, weapons, and, were, equipped, with, fuel, injected, engines, curtiss, electric, reversible, pitch, propellers, pneumatic, actuators, for, rapid, opening, and, closing, of, bomb, bay, doors, and, other, improvements, the, ground, support, echelon, of, the, 509th, composite, group, moved, by, rail, on, 26, april, 1945, to, its, port, of, embarkation, at, seattle, washington, on, 6, may, the, support, elements, sailed, on, the, ss, cape, victory, for, the, marianas, while, group, materiel, was, shipped, on, the, ss, emile, berliner, the, cape, victory, made, brief, port, calls, at, honolulu, and, eniwetok, but, the, passengers, were, not, permitted, to, leave, the, dock, area, an, advance, party, of, the, air, echelon, consisting, of, 29, officers, and, 61, enlisted, men, flew, by, c, 54, to, north, field, on, tinian, between, 15, and, 22, may, there, were, also, two, representatives, from, washington, d, c, brigadier, general, thomas, farrell, the, deputy, commander, of, the, manhattan, project, and, rear, admiral, william, r, purnell, of, the, military, policy, committee, who, were, on, hand, to, decide, higher, policy, matters, on, the, spot, along, with, captain, william, s, parsons, the, commander, of, project, alberta, they, became, known, as, the, tinian, joint, chiefs, in, april, 1945, marshall, asked, groves, to, nominate, specific, targets, for, bombing, for, final, approval, by, himself, and, stimson, groves, formed, a, target, committee, chaired, by, himself, that, included, farrell, major, john, a, derry, colonel, william, p, fisher, joyce, c, stearns, and, david, m, dennison, from, the, usaaf, and, scientists, john, von, neumann, robert, r, wilson, and, william, penney, from, the, manhattan, project, the, target, committee, met, in, washington, on, 27, april, at, los, alamos, on, 10, may, where, it, was, able, to, talk, to, the, scientists, and, technicians, there, and, finally, in, washington, on, 28, may, where, it, was, briefed, by, tibbets, and, commander, frederick, ashworth, from, project, alberta, and, the, manhattan, project, s, scientific, advisor, richard, c, tolman, the, target, committee, nominated, five, targets, kokura, now, kitakyushu, the, site, of, one, of, japan, s, largest, munitions, plants, hiroshima, an, embarkation, port, and, industrial, center, that, was, the, site, of, a, major, military, headquarters, yokohama, an, urban, center, for, aircraft, manufacture, machine, tools, docks, electrical, equipment, and, oil, refineries, niigata, a, port, with, industrial, facilities, including, steel, and, aluminum, plants, and, an, oil, refinery, and, kyoto, a, major, industrial, center, the, target, selection, was, subject, to, the, following, criteria, these, cities, were, largely, untouched, during, the, nightly, bombing, raids, and, the, army, air, forces, agreed, to, leave, them, off, the, target, list, so, accurate, assessment, of, the, damage, caused, by, the, atomic, bombs, could, be, made, hiroshima, was, described, as, an, important, army, depot, and, port, of, embarkation, in, the, middle, of, an, urban, industrial, area, it, is, a, good, radar, target, and, it, is, such, a, size, that, a, large, part, of, the, city, could, be, extensively, damaged, there, are, adjacent, hills, which, are, likely, to, produce, a, focusing, effect, which, would, considerably, increase, the, blast, damage, due, to, rivers, it, is, not, a, good, incendiary, target, the, target, committee, stated, that, it, was, agreed, that, psychological, factors, in, the, target, selection, were, of, great, importance, two, aspects, of, this, are, 1, obtaining, the, greatest, psychological, effect, against, japan, and, 2, making, the, initial, use, sufficiently, spectacular, for, the, importance, of, the, weapon, to, be, internationally, recognized, when, publicity, on, it, is, released, kyoto, has, the, advantage, of, the, people, being, more, highly, intelligent, and, hence, better, able, to, appreciate, the, significance, of, the, weapon, hiroshima, has, the, advantage, of, being, such, a, size, and, with, possible, focussing, from, nearby, mountains, that, a, large, fraction, of, the, city, may, be, destroyed, the, emperor, s, palace, in, tokyo, has, a, greater, fame, than, any, other, target, but, is, of, least, strategic, value, edwin, o, reischauer, a, japan, expert, for, the, u, s, army, intelligence, service, was, incorrectly, said, to, have, prevented, the, bombing, of, kyoto, in, his, autobiography, reischauer, specifically, refuted, this, claim, the, only, person, deserving, credit, for, saving, kyoto, from, destruction, is, henry, l, stimson, the, secretary, of, war, at, the, time, who, had, known, and, admired, kyoto, ever, since, his, honeymoon, there, several, decades, earlier, extant, sources, show, that, while, stimson, was, personally, familiar, with, kyoto, this, was, the, result, of, a, visit, decades, after, his, marriage, not, because, he, honeymooned, there, on, 30, may, stimson, asked, groves, to, remove, kyoto, from, the, target, list, due, to, its, historical, religious, and, cultural, significance, but, groves, pointed, to, its, military, and, industrial, significance, stimson, then, approached, president, harry, s, truman, about, the, matter, truman, agreed, with, stimson, and, kyoto, was, temporarily, removed, from, the, target, list, groves, attempted, to, restore, kyoto, to, the, target, list, in, july, but, stimson, remained, adamant, on, 25, july, nagasaki, was, put, on, the, target, list, in, place, of, kyoto, it, was, a, major, military, port, one, of, japan, s, largest, shipbuilding, and, repair, centers, and, an, important, producer, of, naval, ordnance, in, early, may, 1945, the, interim, committee, was, created, by, stimson, at, the, urging, of, leaders, of, the, manhattan, project, and, with, the, approval, of, truman, to, advise, on, matters, pertaining, to, nuclear, technology, they, agreed, that, the, atomic, bomb, was, to, be, used, 1, against, japan, at, the, earliest, opportunity, 2, without, special, warning, and, 3, on, a, dual, target, of, military, installation, surrounded, by, other, buildings, susceptible, to, damage, during, the, meetings, on, 31, may, and, 1, june, scientist, ernest, lawrence, had, suggested, giving, the, japanese, a, non, combat, demonstration, arthur, compton, later, recalled, that, it, was, evident, that, everyone, would, suspect, trickery, if, a, bomb, were, exploded, in, japan, with, previous, notice, the, japanese, air, power, was, still, adequate, to, give, serious, interference, an, atomic, bomb, was, an, intricate, device, still, in, the, developmental, stage, its, operation, would, be, far, from, routine, if, during, the, final, adjustments, of, the, bomb, the, japanese, defenders, should, attack, a, faulty, move, might, easily, result, in, some, kind, of, failure, such, an, end, to, an, advertised, demonstration, of, power, would, be, much, worse, than, if, the, attempt, had, not, been, made, it, was, now, evident, that, when, the, time, came, for, the, bombs, to, be, used, we, should, have, only, one, of, them, available, followed, afterwards, by, others, at, all, too, long, intervals, we, could, not, afford, the, chance, that, one, of, them, might, be, a, dud, if, the, test, were, made, on, some, neutral, territory, it, was, hard, to, believe, that, japan, s, determined, and, fanatical, military, men, would, be, impressed, if, such, an, open, test, were, made, first, and, failed, to, bring, surrender, the, chance, would, be, gone, to, give, the, shock, of, surprise, that, proved, so, effective, on, the, contrary, it, would, make, the, japanese, ready, to, interfere, with, an, atomic, attack, if, they, could, though, the, possibility, of, a, demonstration, that, would, not, destroy, human, lives, was, attractive, no, one, could, suggest, a, way, in, which, it, could, be, made, so, convincing, that, it, would, be, likely, to, stop, the, war, the, possibility, of, a, demonstration, was, raised, again, in, the, franck, report, issued, by, physicist, james, franck, on, 11, june, and, the, scientific, advisory, panel, rejected, his, report, on, 16, june, saying, that, we, can, propose, no, technical, demonstration, likely, to, bring, an, end, to, the, war, we, see, no, acceptable, alternative, to, direct, military, use, franck, then, took, the, report, to, washington, d, c, where, the, interim, committee, met, on, 21, june, to, re, examine, its, earlier, conclusions, but, it, reaffirmed, that, there, was, no, alternative, to, the, use, of, the, bomb, on, a, military, target, like, compton, many, u, s, officials, and, scientists, argued, that, a, demonstration, would, sacrifice, the, shock, value, of, the, atomic, attack, and, the, japanese, could, deny, the, atomic, bomb, was, lethal, making, the, mission, less, likely, to, produce, surrender, allied, prisoners, of, war, might, be, moved, to, the, demonstration, site, and, be, killed, by, the, bomb, they, also, worried, that, the, bomb, might, be, a, failure, as, the, trinity, test, was, that, of, a, stationary, device, not, an, air, dropped, bomb, in, addition, although, more, bombs, were, in, production, only, two, would, be, available, at, the, start, of, august, and, they, cost, billions, of, dollars, so, using, one, for, a, demonstration, would, be, expensive, for, several, months, the, u, s, had, warned, civilians, of, potential, air, raids, by, dropping, more, than, 63, million, leaflets, across, japan, many, japanese, cities, suffered, terrible, damage, from, aerial, bombings, some, were, as, much, as, 97, percent, destroyed, lemay, thought, that, leaflets, would, increase, the, psychological, impact, of, bombing, and, reduce, the, international, stigma, of, area, bombing, cities, even, with, the, warnings, japanese, opposition, to, the, war, remained, ineffective, in, general, the, japanese, regarded, the, leaflet, messages, as, truthful, with, many, japanese, choosing, to, leave, major, cities, the, leaflets, caused, such, concern, that, the, government, ordered, the, arrest, of, anyone, caught, in, possession, of, a, leaflet, leaflet, texts, were, prepared, by, recent, japanese, prisoners, of, war, because, they, were, thought, to, be, the, best, choice, to, appeal, to, their, compatriots, in, preparation, for, dropping, an, atomic, bomb, on, hiroshima, the, oppenheimer, led, scientific, panel, of, the, interim, committee, decided, against, a, demonstration, bomb, and, against, a, special, leaflet, warning, those, decisions, were, implemented, because, of, the, uncertainty, of, a, successful, detonation, and, also, because, of, the, wish, to, maximize, shock, in, the, leadership, no, warning, was, given, to, hiroshima, that, a, new, and, much, more, destructive, bomb, was, going, to, be, dropped, various, sources, gave, conflicting, information, about, when, the, last, leaflets, were, dropped, on, hiroshima, prior, to, the, atomic, bomb, robert, jay, lifton, wrote, that, it, was, 27, july, and, theodore, h, mcnelly, wrote, that, it, was, 30, july, the, usaaf, history, noted, that, eleven, cities, were, targeted, with, leaflets, on, 27, july, but, hiroshima, was, not, one, of, them, and, there, were, no, leaflet, sorties, on, 30, july, leaflet, sorties, were, undertaken, on, 1, and, 4, august, hiroshima, may, have, been, leafleted, in, late, july, or, early, august, as, survivor, accounts, talk, about, a, delivery, of, leaflets, a, few, days, before, the, atomic, bomb, was, dropped, three, versions, were, printed, of, a, leaflet, listing, 11, or, 12, cities, targeted, for, firebombing, a, total, of, 33, cities, listed, with, the, text, of, this, leaflet, reading, in, japanese, we, cannot, promise, that, only, these, cities, will, be, among, those, attacked, hiroshima, was, not, listed, in, 1943, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, signed, the, quebec, agreement, which, stipulated, that, nuclear, weapons, would, not, be, used, against, another, country, without, mutual, consent, stimson, therefore, had, to, obtain, british, permission, a, meeting, of, the, combined, policy, committee, which, included, one, canadian, representative, was, held, at, the, pentagon, on, 4, july, 1945, field, marshal, sir, henry, maitland, wilson, announced, that, the, british, government, concurred, with, the, use, of, nuclear, weapons, against, japan, which, would, be, officially, recorded, as, a, decision, of, the, combined, policy, committee, as, the, release, of, information, to, third, parties, was, also, controlled, by, the, quebec, agreement, discussion, then, turned, to, what, scientific, details, would, be, revealed, in, the, press, announcement, of, the, bombing, the, meeting, also, considered, what, truman, could, reveal, to, joseph, stalin, the, leader, of, the, soviet, union, at, the, upcoming, potsdam, conference, as, this, also, required, british, concurrence, orders, for, the, attack, were, issued, to, general, carl, spaatz, on, 25, july, under, the, signature, of, general, thomas, t, handy, the, acting, chief, of, staff, since, marshall, was, at, the, potsdam, conference, with, truman, it, read, that, day, truman, noted, in, his, diary, that, this, weapon, is, to, be, used, against, japan, between, now, and, august, 10th, i, have, told, the, sec, of, war, mr, stimson, to, use, it, so, that, military, objectives, and, soldiers, and, sailors, are, the, target, and, not, women, and, children, even, if, the, japs, are, savages, ruthless, merciless, and, fanatic, we, as, the, leader, of, the, world, for, the, common, welfare, cannot, drop, that, terrible, bomb, on, the, old, capital, or, the, new, he, and, i, are, in, accord, the, target, will, be, a, purely, military, one, the, 16, july, success, of, the, trinity, test, in, the, new, mexico, desert, exceeded, expectations, on, 26, july, allied, leaders, issued, the, potsdam, declaration, which, outlined, the, terms, of, surrender, for, japan, the, declaration, was, presented, as, an, ultimatum, and, stated, that, without, a, surrender, the, allies, would, attack, japan, resulting, in, the, inevitable, and, complete, destruction, of, the, japanese, armed, forces, and, just, as, inevitably, the, utter, devastation, of, the, japanese, homeland, the, atomic, bomb, was, not, mentioned, in, the, communiqu, on, 28, july, japanese, papers, reported, that, the, declaration, had, been, rejected, by, the, japanese, government, that, afternoon, prime, minister, kantar, suzuki, declared, at, a, press, conference, that, the, potsdam, declaration, was, no, more, than, a, rehash, yakinaoshi, of, the, cairo, declaration, that, the, government, intended, to, ignore, it, mokusatsu, kill, by, silence, and, that, japan, would, fight, to, the, end, the, statement, was, taken, by, both, japanese, and, foreign, papers, as, a, clear, rejection, of, the, declaration, emperor, hirohito, who, was, waiting, for, a, soviet, reply, to, non, committal, japanese, peace, feelers, made, no, move, to, change, the, government, position, japan, s, willingness, to, surrender, remained, conditional, on, the, preservation, of, the, kokutai, imperial, institution, and, national, polity, assumption, by, the, imperial, headquarters, of, responsibility, for, disarmament, and, demobilization, no, occupation, of, the, japanese, home, islands, korea, or, formosa, and, delegation, of, the, punishment, of, war, criminals, to, the, japanese, government, at, potsdam, truman, agreed, to, a, request, from, winston, churchill, that, britain, be, represented, when, the, atomic, bomb, was, dropped, william, penney, and, group, captain, leonard, cheshire, were, sent, to, tinian, but, found, that, lemay, would, not, let, them, accompany, the, mission, all, they, could, do, was, send, a, strongly, worded, signal, to, wilson, the, little, boy, bomb, except, for, the, uranium, payload, was, ready, at, the, beginning, of, may, 1945, there, were, two, uranium, 235, components, a, hollow, cylindrical, projectile, and, a, cylindrical, target, insert, the, projectile, was, completed, on, 15, june, and, the, target, insert, on, 24, july, the, projectile, and, eight, bomb, pre, assemblies, partly, assembled, bombs, without, the, powder, charge, and, fissile, components, left, hunters, point, naval, shipyard, california, on, 16, july, aboard, the, cruiser, uss, indianapolis, and, arrived, on, tinian, on, 26, july, the, target, insert, followed, by, air, on, 30, july, accompanied, by, commander, francis, birch, from, project, alberta, responding, to, concerns, expressed, by, the, 509th, composite, group, about, the, possibility, of, a, b, 29, crashing, on, takeoff, birch, had, modified, the, little, boy, design, to, incorporate, a, removable, breech, plug, that, would, permit, the, bomb, to, be, armed, in, flight, the, first, plutonium, core, along, with, its, polonium, beryllium, urchin, initiator, was, transported, in, the, custody, of, project, alberta, courier, raemer, schreiber, in, a, magnesium, field, carrying, case, designed, for, the, purpose, by, philip, morrison, magnesium, was, chosen, because, it, does, not, act, as, a, neutron, reflector, the, core, departed, from, kirtland, army, air, field, on, a, c, 54, transport, aircraft, of, the, 509th, composite, group, s, 320th, troop, carrier, squadron, on, 26, july, and, arrived, at, north, field, 28, july, three, fat, man, high, explosive, pre, assemblies, designated, f31, f32, and, f33, were, picked, up, at, kirtland, on, 28, july, by, three, b, 29s, two, from, the, 393d, bombardment, squadron, plus, one, from, the, 216th, army, air, force, base, unit, and, transported, to, north, field, arriving, on, 2, august, at, the, time, of, its, bombing, hiroshima, was, a, city, of, industrial, and, military, significance, a, number, of, military, units, were, located, nearby, the, most, important, of, which, was, the, headquarters, of, field, marshal, shunroku, hata, s, second, general, army, which, commanded, the, defense, of, all, of, southern, japan, and, was, located, in, hiroshima, castle, hata, s, command, consisted, of, some, 400, 000, men, most, of, whom, were, on, kyushu, where, an, allied, invasion, was, correctly, anticipated, also, present, in, hiroshima, were, the, headquarters, of, the, 59th, army, the, 5th, division, and, the, 224th, division, a, recently, formed, mobile, unit, the, city, was, defended, by, five, batteries, of, 70, mm, and, 80, mm, 2, 8, and, 3, 1, inch, anti, aircraft, guns, of, the, 3rd, anti, aircraft, division, including, units, from, the, 121st, and, 122nd, anti, aircraft, regiments, and, the, 22nd, and, 45th, separate, anti, aircraft, battalions, in, total, an, estimated, 40, 000, japanese, military, personnel, were, stationed, in, the,

supported, a, large, war, industry, manufacturing, parts, for, planes, and, boats, for, bombs, rifles, and, handguns, the, center, of, the, city, contained, several, reinforced, concrete, buildings, outside, the, center, the, area, was, congested, by, a, dense, collection, of, small, timber, workshops, set, among, japanese, houses, a, few, larger, industrial, plants, lay, near, the, outskirts, of, the, city, the, houses, were, constructed, of, timber, with, tile, roofs, and, many, of, the, industrial, buildings, were, also, built, around, timber, frames, the, city, as, a, whole, was, highly, susceptible, to, fire, damage, it, was, the, second, largest, city, in, japan, after, kyoto, that, was, still, undamaged, by, air, raids, primarily, because, it, lacked, the, aircraft, manufacturing, industry, that, was, the, xxi, bomber, command, s, priority, target, on, 3, july, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, placed, it, off, limits, to, bombers, along, with, kokura, niigata, and, kyoto, the, population, of, hiroshima, had, reached, a, peak, of, over, 381, 000, earlier, in, the, war, but, prior, to, the, atomic, bombing, the, population, had, steadily, decreased, because, of, a, systematic, evacuation, ordered, by, the, japanese, government, at, the, time, of, the, attack, the, population, was, approximately, 340, 000, 350, 000, residents, wondered, why, hiroshima, had, been, spared, destruction, by, firebombing, some, speculated, that, the, city, was, to, be, saved, for, u, s, occupation, headquarters, others, thought, perhaps, their, relatives, in, hawaii, and, california, had, petitioned, the, u, s, government, to, avoid, bombing, hiroshima, more, realistic, city, officials, had, ordered, buildings, torn, down, to, create, long, straight, firebreaks, these, continued, to, be, expanded, and, extended, up, to, the, morning, of, 6, august, 1945, hiroshima, was, the, primary, target, of, the, first, atomic, bombing, mission, on, 6, august, with, kokura, and, nagasaki, as, alternative, targets, the, 393rd, bombardment, squadron, b, 29, enola, gay, named, after, tibbets, s, mother, and, piloted, by, tibbets, took, off, from, north, field, tinian, about,

containing, about, 64, kg, 141, lb, of, uranium, 235, took, 44, 4, seconds, to, fall, from, the, aircraft, flying, at, about, 9, 400, meters, 31, 000, ft, to, a, detonation, height, of, about, 580, meters, 1, 900, ft, above, the, city, enola, gay, was, 18, 5, km, 11, 5, mi, away, before, it, felt, the, shock, waves, from, the, blast, due, to, crosswind, the, bomb, missed, the, aiming, point, the, aioi, bridge, by, approximately, 240, m, 800, ft, and, detonated, directly, over, shima, surgical, clinic, it, released, the, equivalent, energy, of, 16, 2, kilotons, of, tnt, 66, 9, 8, 4, tj, the, weapon, was, considered, very, inefficient, with, only, 1, 7, percent, of, its, material, fissioning, the, radius, of, total, destruction, was, about, 1, 6, kilometers, 1, mi, with, resulting, fires, across, 11, km, 2, 4, 4, sq, mi, enola, gay, stayed, over, the, target, area, for, two, minutes, and, was, 16, kilometers, 10, mi, away, when, the, bomb, detonated, only, tibbets, parsons, and, ferebee, knew, of, the, nature, of, the, weapon, the, others, on, the, bomber, were, only, told, to, expect, a, blinding, flash, and, given, black, goggles, it, was, hard, to, believe, what, we, saw, tibbets, told, reporters, while, parsons, said, the, whole, thing, was, tremendous, and, awe, inspiring, the, men, aboard, with, me, gasped, my, god, he, and, tibbets, compared, the, shockwave, to, a, close, burst, of, ack, ack, fire, people, on, the, ground, reported, a, pika, a, brilliant, flash, of, light, followed, by, a, don, a, loud, booming, sound, the, experiences, of, survivors, in, the, city, varied, depending, on, their, location, and, circumstances, but, a, common, factor, in, survivor, accounts, was, a, sense, that, a, conventional, weapon, sometimes, cited, as, a, magnesium, bomb, which, have, a, distinctively, bright, white, flash, had, happened, to, go, off, immediately, in, their, vicinity, causing, tremendous, damage, throwing, people, across, rooms, breaking, glass, crushing, buildings, after, emerging, from, the, ruins, the, survivors, gradually, understood, that, the, entire, city, had, been, attacked, at, the, same, instant, survivor, accounts, frequently, feature, walking, through, the, ruins, of, the, city, without, a, clear, sense, of, where, to, go, and, encountering, the, cries, of, people, trapped, within, crushed, structures, or, people, with, horrific, burns, as, the, numerous, small, fires, created, by, the, blast, began, to, grow, they, merged, into, a, firestorm, that, moved, quickly, throughout, the, ruins, killing, many, who, had, been, trapped, and, causing, people, to, jump, into, hiroshima, s, rivers, in, search, of, sanctuary, many, of, whom, drowned, the, photographer, yoshito, matsushige, took, the, only, photographs, of, hiroshima, immediately, after, the, bombing, he, described, in, a, later, interview, that, immediately, after, the, bombing, everywhere, there, was, dust, it, made, a, grayish, darkness, over, everything, he, took, five, photographs, in, total, before, he, could, not, continue, it, was, really, a, terrible, scene, it, was, just, like, something, out, of, hell, survivor, accounts, also, prominently, feature, cases, of, survivors, who, appeared, uninjured, but, who, would, succumb, within, hours, or, days, to, what, would, later, be, identified, as, radiation, sickness, the, exact, number, of, people, killed, by, the, blast, firestorm, and, radiation, effects, of, the, bombing, are, unknown, difficulty, in, coming, up, with, a, correct, figure, is, due, to, the, imprecise, record, keeping, during, the, war, the, chaos, caused, by, the, attack, lack, of, agreement, on, how, many, people, were, in, the, city, on, the, morning, of, the, attack, and, uncertainty, in, methodology, reports, by, the, manhattan, project, in, 1946, and, the, u, s, occupation, led, joint, commission, for, the, investigation, of, the, atomic, bomb, in, japan, in, 1951, estimated, 66, 000, dead, and, 69, 000, injured, and, 64, 500, dead, and, 72, 000, injured, respectively, while, japanese, led, reconsiderations, of, the, death, toll, in, the, 1970s, estimated, 140, 000, dead, in, hiroshima, by, the, end, of, the, year, estimates, also, vary, on, the, number, of, japanese, military, personnel, killed, the, united, states, strategic, bombing, survey, estimated, in, 1946, that, there, were, 24, 158, soldiers, present, in, hiroshima, at, the, time, of, the, attack, and, that, 6, 789, were, killed, or, missing, as, a, result, the, 1970s, reconsiderations, estimated, about, 10, 000, military, dead, a, modern, estimate, by, the, radiation, effects, research, foundation, rerf, estimates, a, city, population, of, 340, 000, to, 350, 000, at, the, time, of, the, bombing, of, which, 90, 000, to, 166, 000, died, by, the, end, of, the, year, u, s, surveys, estimated, that, 12, km, 2, 4, 7, sq, mi, of, the, city, were, destroyed, japanese, officials, determined, that, 69, percent, of, hiroshima, s, buildings, were, destroyed, and, another, 6, to, 7, percent, damaged, some, of, the, reinforced, concrete, buildings, in, hiroshima, had, been, very, strongly, constructed, because, of, the, earthquake, danger, in, japan, and, their, framework, did, not, collapse, even, though, they, were, fairly, close, to, the, blast, center, since, the, bomb, detonated, in, the, air,

sizable, store, of, explosives, was, in, hiroshima, at, that, time, a, young, officer, was, instructed, to, fly, immediately, to, hiroshima, to, land, survey, the, damage, and, return, to, tokyo, with, reliable, information, for, the, staff, it, was, felt, that, nothing, serious, had, taken, place, and, that, the, explosion, was, just, a, rumor, the, staff, officer, went, to, the, airport, and, took, off, for, the, southwest, after, flying, for, about, three, hours, while, still, nearly, 160, km, 100, mi, from, hiroshima, he, and, his, pilot, saw, a, great, cloud, of, smoke, from, the,

the, hiroshima, bombing, truman, issued, a, statement, announcing, the, use, of, the, new, weapon, he, stated, we, may, be, grateful, to, providence, that, the, german, atomic, bomb, project, had, failed, and, that, the, united, states, and, its, allies, had, spent, two, billion, dollars, on, the, greatest, scientific, gamble, in, history, and, won, truman, then, warned, japan, if, they, do, not, now, accept, our, terms, they, may, expect, a, rain, of, ruin, from, the, air, the, like, of, which, has, never, been, seen, on, this, earth, behind, this, air, attack, will, follow, sea, and, land, forces, in, such, numbers, and, power, as, they, have, not, yet, seen, and, with, the, fighting, skill, of, which, they, are, already, well, aware, this, was, a, widely, broadcast, speech, picked, up, by, japanese, news, agencies, the, 50, 000, watt, standard, wave, station, on, saipan, the, owi, radio, station, broadcast, a, similar, message, to, japan, every, 15, minutes, about, hiroshima, stating, that, more, japanese, cities, would, face, a, similar, fate, in, the, absence, of, immediate, acceptance, of, the, terms, of, the, potsdam, declaration, and, emphatically, urged, civilians, to, evacuate, major, cities, radio, japan, which, continued, to, extoll, victory, for, japan, by, never, surrendering, had, informed, the, japanese, of, the, destruction, of, hiroshima, by, a, single, bomb, soviet, foreign, minister, vyacheslav, molotov, had, informed, tokyo, of, the, soviet, union, s, unilateral, abrogation, of, the, soviet, japanese, neutrality, pact, on, 5, april, at,

of, minister, of, war, korechika, anami, to, stop, anyone, attempting, to, make, peace, on, 7, august, a, day, after, hiroshima, was, destroyed, yoshio, nishina, and, other, atomic, physicists, arrived, at, the, city, and, carefully, examined, the, damage, they, then, went, back, to, tokyo, and, told, the, cabinet, that, hiroshima, was, indeed, destroyed, by, a, nuclear, weapon, admiral, soemu, toyoda, the, chief, of, the, naval, general, staff, estimated, that, no, more, than, one, or, two, additional, bombs, could, be, readied, so, they, decided, to, endure, the, remaining, attacks, acknowledging, there, would, be, more, destruction, but, the, war, would, go, on, american, magic, codebreakers, intercepted, the, cabinet, s, messages, purnell, parsons, tibbets, spaatz, and, lemay, met, on, guam, that, same, day, to, discuss, what, should, be, done, next, since, there, was, no, indication, of, japan, surrendering, they, decided, to, proceed, with, dropping, another, bomb, parsons, said, that, project, alberta, would, have, it, ready, by, 11, august, but, tibbets, pointed, to, weather, reports, indicating, poor, flying, conditions, on, that, day, due, to, a, storm, and, asked, if, the, bomb, could, be, readied, by, 9, august, parsons, agreed, to, try, to, do, so, the, city, of, nagasaki, had, been, one, of, the, largest, seaports, in, southern, japan, and, was, of, great, wartime, importance, because, of, its, wide, ranging, industrial, activity, including, the, production, of, ordnance, ships, military, equipment, and, other, war, materials, the, four, largest, companies, in, the, city, were, mitsubishi, shipyards, electrical, shipyards, arms, plant, and, steel, and, arms, works, which, employed, about, 90, percent, of, the, city, s, labor, force, and, accounted, for, 90, percent, of, the, city, s, industry, although, an, important, industrial, city, nagasaki, had, been, spared, from, firebombing, because, its, geography, made, it, difficult, to, locate, at, night, with, an, apq, 13, radar, unlike, the, other, target, cities, nagasaki, had, not, been, placed, off, limits, to, bombers, by, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, s, 3, july, directive, and, was, bombed, on, a, small, scale, five, times, during, one, of, these, raids, on, 1, august, a, number, of, conventional, high, explosive, bombs, were, dropped, on, the, city, a, few, hit, the, shipyards, and, dock, areas, in, the, southwest, portion, of, the, city, and, several, hit, the, mitsubishi, steel, and, arms, works, by, early, august, the, city, was, defended, by, the, 134th, anti, aircraft, regiment, of, the, 4th, anti, aircraft, division, with, four, batteries, of, 7, cm, 2, 8, in, anti, aircraft, guns, and, two, searchlight, batteries, in, contrast, to, hiroshima, almost, all, of, the, buildings, were, of, old, fashioned, japanese, construction, consisting, of, timber, or, timber, framed, buildings, with, timber, walls, with, or, without, plaster, and, tile, roofs, many, of, the, smaller, industries, and, business, establishments, were, also, situated, in, buildings, of, timber, or, other, materials, not, designed, to, withstand, explosions, nagasaki, had, been, permitted, to, grow, for, many, years, without, conforming, to, any, definite, city, zoning, plan, residences, were, erected, adjacent, to, factory, buildings, and, to, each, other, almost, as, closely, as, possible, throughout, the, entire, industrial, valley, on, the, day, of, the, bombing, an, estimated, 263, 000, people, were, in, nagasaki, including, 240, 000, japanese, residents, 10, 000, korean, residents, 2, 500, conscripted, korean, workers, 9, 000, japanese, soldiers, 600, conscripted, chinese, workers, and, 400, allied, prisoners, of, war, in, a, camp, to, the, north, of, nagasaki, responsibility, for, the, timing, of, the, second, bombing, was, delegated, to, tibbets, scheduled, for, 11, august, the, raid, was, moved, earlier, by, two, days, to, avoid, a, five, day, period, of, bad, weather, forecast, to, begin, on, 10, august, three, bomb, pre, assemblies, had, been, transported, to, tinian, labeled, f, 31, f, 32, and, f, 33, on, their, exteriors, on, 8, august, a, dress, rehearsal, was, conducted, off, tinian, by, sweeney, using, bockscar, as, the, drop, airplane, assembly, f, 33, was, expended, testing, the, components, and, f, 31, was, designated, for, the, 9, august, mission, at, 03, 47, tinian, time, gmt, 10, 02, 47, japanese, time, on, the, morning, of, 9, august, 1945, bockscar, flown, by, sweeney, s, crew, lifted, off, from, tinian, island, with, the, fat, man, with, kokura, as, the, primary, target, and, nagasaki, the, secondary, target, the, mission, plan, for, the, second, attack, was, nearly, identical, to, that, of, the, hiroshima, mission, with, two, b, 29s, flying, an, hour, ahead, as, weather, scouts, and, two, additional, b, 29s, in, sweeney, s, flight, for, instrumentation, and, photographic, support, of, the, mission, sweeney, took, off, with, his, weapon, already, armed, but, with, the, electrical, safety, plugs, still, engaged, during, pre, flight, inspection, of, bockscar, the, flight, engineer, notified, sweeney, that, an, inoperative, fuel, transfer, pump, made, it, impossible, to, use, 2, 400, liters, 640, u, s, gal, of, fuel, carried, in, a, reserve, tank, this, fuel, would, still, have, to, be, carried, all, the, way, to, japan, and, back, consuming, still, more, fuel, replacing, the, pump, would, take, hours, moving, the, fat, man, to, another, aircraft, might, take, just, as, long, and, was, dangerous, as, well, as, the, bomb, was, live, tibbets, and, sweeney, therefore, elected, to, have, bockscar, continue, the, mission, this, time, penney, and, cheshire, were, allowed, to, accompany, the, mission, flying, as, observers, on, the, third, plane, big, stink, flown, by, the, group, s, operations, officer, major, james, i, hopkins, jr, observers, aboard, the, weather, planes, reported, both, targets, clear, when, sweeney, s, aircraft, arrived, at, the, assembly, point, for, his, flight, off, the, coast, of, japan, big, stink, failed, to, make, the, rendezvous, according, to, cheshire, hopkins, was, at, varying, heights, including, 2, 700, meters, 9, 000, ft, higher, than, he, should, have, been, and, was, not, flying, tight, circles, over, yakushima, as, previously, agreed, with, sweeney, and, captain, frederick, c, bock, who, was, piloting, the, support, b, 29, the, great, artiste, instead, hopkins, was, flying, 64, kilometer, 40, mi, dogleg, patterns, though, ordered, not, to, circle, longer, than, fifteen, minutes, sweeney, continued, to, wait, for, big, stink, for, forty, minutes, before, leaving, the, rendezvous, point, sweeney, consulted, ashworth, who, was, in, charge, of, the, bomb, as, commander, of, the, aircraft, sweeney, made, the, decision, to, proceed, to, the, primary, the, city, of, kokura, after, exceeding, the, original, departure, time, limit, by, nearly, a, half, hour, bockscar, accompanied, by, the, great, artiste, proceeded, to, kokura, thirty, minutes, away, the, delay, at, the, rendezvous, had, resulted, in, clouds, and, drifting, smoke, over, kokura, from, fires, started, by, a, major, firebombing, raid, by, 224, b, 29s, on, nearby, yahata, the, previous, day, additionally, the, yahata, steel, works, intentionally, burned, coal, tar, to, produce, black, smoke, the, clouds, and, smoke, resulted, in, 70, percent, of, the, area, over, kokura, being, covered, obscuring, the, aiming, point, three, bomb, runs, were, made, over, the, next, 50, minutes, burning, fuel, and, exposing, the, aircraft, repeatedly, to, the, heavy, defenses, around, kokura, but, the, bombardier, was, unable, to, drop, visually, by, the, time, of, the, third, bomb, run, japanese, anti, aircraft, fire, was, getting, close, and, second, lieutenant, jacob, beser, who, was, monitoring, japanese, communications, reported, activity, on, the, japanese, fighter, direction, radio, bands, with, fuel, running, low, because, of, the, failed, fuel, pump, bockscar, and, the, great, artiste, headed, for, their, secondary, target, nagasaki, fuel, consumption, calculations, made, en, route, indicated, that, bockscar, had, insufficient, fuel, to, reach, iwo, jima, and, would, be, forced, to, divert, to, okinawa, which, had, become, entirely, allied, occupied, territory, only, six, weeks, earlier, after, initially, deciding, that, if, nagasaki, were, obscured, on, their, arrival, the, crew, would, carry, the, bomb, to, okinawa, and, dispose, of, it, in, the, ocean, if, necessary, ashworth, agreed, with, sweeney, s, suggestion, that, a, radar, approach, would, be, used, if, the, target, was, obscured, at, about, 07, 50, japanese, time, an, air, raid, alert, was, sounded, in, nagasaki, but, the, all, clear, signal, was, given, at, 08, 30, when, only, two, b, 29, superfortresses, were, sighted, at, 10, 53, japanese, time, gmt, 9, the, japanese, apparently, assumed, that, the, planes, were, only, on, reconnaissance, and, no, further, alarm, was, given, a, few, minutes, later, at, 11, 00, japanese, time, the, great, artiste, dropped, instruments, attached, to, three, parachutes, these, instruments, also, contained, an, unsigned, letter, to, professor, ryokichi, sagane, a, physicist, at, the, university, of, tokyo, who, studied, with, three, of, the, scientists, responsible, for, the, atomic, bomb, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, urging, him, to, tell, the, public, about, the, danger, involved, with, these, weapons, of, mass, destruction, the, messages, were, found, by, military, authorities, but, not, turned, over, to, sagane, until, a, month, later, in, 1949, one, of, the, authors, of, the, letter, luis, alvarez, met, with, sagane, and, signed, the, letter, at, 11, 01, japanese, time, a, last, minute, break, in, the, clouds, over, nagasaki, allowed, bockscar, s, bombardier, captain, kermit, beahan, to, visually, sight, the, target, as, ordered, the, fat, man, weapon, containing, a, core, of, about, 5, kg, 11, lb, of, plutonium, was, dropped, over, the, city, s, industrial, valley, it, exploded, 47, seconds, later, at, 11, 02, japanese, time, at, 503, 10, m, 1, 650, 33, ft, above, a, tennis, court, halfway, between, the, mitsubishi, steel, and, arms, works, in, the, south, and, the, nagasaki, arsenal, in, the, north, this, was, nearly, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, northwest, of, the, planned, hypocenter, the, blast, was, confined, to, the, urakami, valley, and, a, major, portion, of, the, city, was, protected, by, the, intervening, hills, the, resulting, explosion, released, the, equivalent, energy, of, 21, 2, kt, 87, 9, 8, 4, tj, big, stink, spotted, the, explosion, from, 160, kilometers, 100, mi, away, and, flew, over, to, observe, bockscar, flew, on, to, okinawa, arriving, with, only, sufficient, fuel, for, a, single, approach, sweeney, tried, repeatedly, to, contact, the, control, tower, for, landing, clearance, but, received, no, answer, he, could, see, heavy, air, traffic, landing, and, taking, off, from, yontan, airfield, firing, off, every, flare, on, board, to, alert, the, field, to, his, emergency, landing, the, bockscar, came, in, fast, landing, at, 230, km, h, 140, mph, instead, of, the, normal, 190, kilometers, per, hour, 120, mph, the, number, two, engine, died, from, fuel, starvation, as, he, began, the, final, approach, touching, down, on, only, three, engines, midway, down, the, landing, strip, bockscar, bounced, up, into, the, air, again, for, about, 7, 6, meters, 25, ft, before, slamming, back, down, hard, the, heavy, b, 29, slewed, left, and, towards, a, row, of, parked, b, 24, bombers, before, the, pilots, managed, to, regain, control, its, reversible, propellers, were, insufficient, to, slow, the, aircraft, adequately, and, with, both, pilots, standing, on, the, brakes, bockscar, made, a, swerving, 90, degree, turn, at, the, end, of, the, runway, to, avoid, running, off, it, a, second, engine, died, from, fuel, exhaustion, before, the, plane, came, to, a, stop, following, the, mission, there, was, confusion, over, the, identification, of, the, plane, the, first, eyewitness, account, by, war, correspondent, william, l, laurence, of, the, new, york, times, who, accompanied, the, mission, aboard, the, aircraft, piloted, by, bock, reported, that, sweeney, was, leading, the, mission, in, the, great, artiste, he, also, noted, its, victor, number, as, 77, which, was, that, of, bockscar, laurence, had, interviewed, sweeney, and, his, crew, and, was, aware, that, they, referred, to, their, airplane, as, the, great, artiste, except, for, enola, gay, none, of, the, 393d, s, b, 29s, had, yet, had, names, painted, on, the, noses, a, fact, which, laurence, himself, noted, in, his, account, unaware, of, the, switch, in, aircraft, laurence, assumed, victor, 77, was, the, great, artiste, which, was, in, fact, victor, 89, although, the, bomb, was, more, powerful, than, the, one, used, on, hiroshima, its, effects, were, confined, by, hillsides, to, the, narrow, urakami, valley, of, 7, 500, japanese, employees, who, worked, inside, the, mitsubishi, munitions, plant, including, mobilized, students, and, regular, workers, 6, 200, were, killed, some, 17, 000, 22, 000, others, who, worked, in, other, war, plants, and, factories, in, the, city, died, as, well, the, 1946, manhattan, project, report, estimated, 39, 000, dead, and, 25, 000, injured, and, the, 1951, u, s, led, joint, commission, report, estimated, 39, 214, dead, and, 25, 153, injured, japanese, led, reconsiderations, in, the, 1970s, estimated, 70, 000, dead, in, nagasaki, by, the, end, of, the, year, a, modern, estimate, by, the, radiation, effects, research, foundation, rerf, estimates, a, city, population, of, 250, 000, to, 270, 000, at, the, time, of, the, bombing, of, which, 60, 000, to, 80, 000, died, by, the, end, of, the, year, unlike, hiroshima, s, military, death, toll, only, 150, japanese, soldiers, were, killed, instantly, including, 36, from, the, 134th, aaa, regiment, of, the, 4th, aaa, division, at, least, eight, allied, prisoners, of, war, pows, died, from, the, bombing, and, as, many, as, thirteen, may, have, died, the, eight, confirmed, deaths, included, a, british, pow, royal, air, force, corporal, ronald, shaw, and, seven, dutch, pows, one, american, pow, joe, kieyoomia, was, in, nagasaki, at, the, time, of, the, bombing, but, survived, reportedly, having, been, shielded, from, the, effects, of, the, bomb, by, the, concrete, walls, of, his, cell, there, were, 24, australian, pows, in, nagasaki, all, of, whom, survived, the, radius, of, total, destruction, was, about, 1, 6, km, 1, mi, followed, by, fires, across, the, northern, portion, of, the, city, to, 3, 2, km, 2, mi, south, of, the, bomb, about, 58, percent, of, the, mitsubishi, arms, plant, was, damaged, and, about, 78, percent, of, the, mitsubishi, steel, works, the, mitsubishi, electric, works, suffered, only, 10, percent, structural, damage, as, it, was, on, the, border, of, the, main, destruction, zone, the, nagasaki, arsenal, was, destroyed, in, the, blast, although, many, fires, likewise, burnt, following, the, bombing, in, contrast, to, hiroshima, where, sufficient, fuel, density, was, available, no, firestorm, developed, in, nagasaki, as, the, damaged, areas, did, not, furnish, enough, fuel, to, generate, the, phenomenon, instead, ambient, wind, pushed, the, fire, spread, along, the, valley, had, the, bomb, been, dropped, more, precisely, at, the, intended, aiming, point, which, was, downtown, nagasaki, at, the, heart, of, the, historic, district, the, destruction, to, medical, and, administrative, infrastructure, would, have, been, even, greater, as, in, hiroshima, the, bombing, badly, dislocated, the, city, s, medical, facilities, a, makeshift, hospital, was, established, at, the, shinkozen, primary, school, which, served, as, the, main, medical, center, the, trains, were, still, running, and, evacuated, many, victims, to, hospitals, in, nearby, towns, a, medical, team, from, a, naval, hospital, reached, the, city, in, the, evening, and, fire, fighting, brigades, from, the, neighboring, towns, assisted, in, fighting, the, fires, takashi, nagai, was, a, doctor, working, in, the, radiology, department, of, nagasaki, medical, college, hospital, he, received, a, serious, injury, that, severed, his, right, temporal, artery, but, joined, the, rest, of, the, surviving, medical, staff, in, treating, bombing, victims, there, were, plans, for, further, attacks, on, japan, following, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, groves, expected, to, have, another, fat, man, atomic, bomb, ready, for, use, on, 19, august, with, three, more, in, september, and, a, further, three, in, october, a, second, little, boy, bomb, using, u, 235, would, not, be, available, until, december, 1945, on, 10, august, he, sent, a, memorandum, to, marshall, in, which, he, wrote, that, the, next, bomb, should, be, ready, for, delivery, on, the, first, suitable, weather, after, 17, or, 18, august, the, memo, today, contains, hand, written, comment, written, by, marshall, it, is, not, to, be, released, over, japan, without, express, authority, from, the, president, at, the, cabinet, meeting, that, morning, truman, discussed, these, actions, james, forrestal, paraphrased, truman, as, saying, there, will, be, further, dropping, of, the, atomic, bomb, while, henry, a, wallace, recorded, in, his, diary, that, truman, said, he, had, given, orders, to, stop, atomic, bombing, he, said, the, thought, of, wiping, out, another, 100, 000, people, was, too, horrific, he, didn, t, like, the, idea, of, killing, as, he, said, all, those, kids, the, previous, order, that, the, target, cities, were, to, be, attacked, with, atomic, bombs, as, made, ready, was, thus, modified, there, was, already, discussion, in, the, war, department, about, conserving, the, bombs, then, in, production, for, operation, downfall, and, marshall, suggested, to, stimson, that, the, remaining, cities, on, the, target, list, be, spared, attack, with, atomic, bombs, two, more, fat, man, assemblies, were, readied, and, scheduled, to, leave, kirtland, field, for, tinian, on, 11, and, 14, august, and, tibbets, was, ordered, by, lemay, to, return, to, albuquerque, new, mexico, to, collect, them, at, los, alamos, technicians, worked, 24, hours, straight, to, cast, another, plutonium, core, although, cast, it, still, needed, to, be, pressed, and, coated, which, would, take, until, 16, august, therefore, it, could, have, been, ready, for, use, on, 19, august, unable, to, reach, marshall, groves, ordered, on, his, own, authority, on, 13, august, that, the, core, should, not, be, shipped, until, 9, august, japan, s, war, council, still, insisted, on, its, four, conditions, for, surrender, the, full, cabinet, met, at, 14, 30, on, 9, august, and, spent, most, of, the, day, debating, surrender, anami, conceded, that, victory, was, unlikely, but, argued, in, favor, of, continuing, the, war, the, meeting, ended, at, 17, 30, with, no, decision, having, been, reached, suzuki, went, to, the, palace, to, report, on, the, outcome, of, the, meeting, where, he, met, with, k, ichi, kido, the, lord, keeper, of, the, privy, seal, of, japan, kido, informed, him, that, the, emperor, had, agreed, to, hold, an, imperial, conference, and, gave, a, strong, indication, that, the, emperor, would, consent, to, surrender, on, condition, that, kokutai, be, preserved, a, second, cabinet, meeting, was, held, at, 18, 00, only, four, ministers, supported, anami, s, position, of, adhering, to, the, four, conditions, but, since, cabinet, decisions, had, to, be, unanimous, no, decision, was, reached, before, it, ended, at, 22, 00, calling, an, imperial, conference, required, the, signatures, of, the, prime, minister, and, the, two, service, chiefs, but, the, chief, cabinet, secretary, hisatsune, sakomizu, had, already, obtained, signatures, from, toyoda, and, general, yoshijir, umezu, in, advance, and, he, reneged, on, his, promise, to, inform, them, if, a, meeting, was, to, be, held, the, meeting, commenced, at, 23, 50, no, consensus, had, emerged, by, 02, 00, on, 10, august, but, the, emperor, gave, his, sacred, decision, authorizing, the, foreign, minister, shigenori, t, g, to, notify, the, allies, that, japan, would, accept, their, terms, on, one, condition, that, the, declaration, does, not, comprise, any, demand, which, prejudices, the, prerogatives, of, his, majesty, as, a, sovereign, ruler, on, 12, august, the, emperor, informed, the, imperial, family, of, his, decision, to, surrender, one, of, his, uncles, prince, asaka, asked, whether, the, war, would, be, continued, if, the, kokutai, could, not, be, preserved, hirohito, simply, replied, of, course, as, the, allied, terms, seemed, to, leave, intact, the, principle, of, the, preservation, of, the, throne, hirohito, recorded, on, 14, august, his, capitulation, announcement, which, was, broadcast, to, the, japanese, nation, the, next, day, despite, an, attempted, military, coup, d, tat, by, militarists, opposed, to, the, surrender, in, his, declaration, s, fifth, paragraph, hirohito, solely, mentions, the, duration, of, the, conflict, and, did, not, explicitly, mention, the, soviets, as, a, factor, for, surrender, but, now, the, war, has, lasted, for, nearly, four, years, despite, the, best, that, has, been, done, by, every, one, the, gallant, fighting, of, military, and, naval, forces, the, diligence, and, assiduity, of, our, servants, of, the, state, and, the, devoted, service, of, our, one, hundred, million, people, the, war, situation, has, developed, not, necessarily, to, japan, s, advantage, while, the, general, trends, of, the, world, have, all, turned, against, her, interest, the, sixth, paragraph, by, hirohito, specifically, mentions, the, use, of, nuclear, ordnance, devices, from, the, aspect, of, the, unprecedented, damage, they, caused, moreover, the, enemy, has, begun, to, employ, a, new, and, most, cruel, bomb, the, power, of, which, to, do, damage, is, indeed, incalculable, taking, the, toll, of, many, innocent, lives, should, we, continue, to, fight, not, only, would, it, result, in, an, ultimate, collapse, and, obliteration, of, the, japanese, nation, but, also, it, would, lead, to, the, total, extinction, of, human, civilization, the, seventh, paragraph, gives, the, reason, for, the, ending, of, hostilities, against, the, allies, such, being, the, case, how, are, we, to, save, the, millions, of, our, subjects, or, to, atone, ourselves, before, the, hallowed, spirits, of, our, imperial, ancestors, this, is, the, reason, why, we, have, ordered, the, acceptance, of, the, provisions, of, the, joint, declaration, of, the, powers, in, his, rescript, to, the, soldiers, and, sailors, delivered, on, 17, august, hirohito, did, not, refer, to, the, atomic, bombs, or, possible, human, extinction, and, instead, described, the, soviet, declaration, of, war, as, endangering, the, very, foundation, of, the, empire, s, existence, on, 10, august, 1945, the, day, after, the, nagasaki, bombing, military, photographer, y, suke, yamahata, correspondent, higashi, and, artist, yamada, arrived, in, the, city, with, instructions, to, record, the, destruction, for, propaganda, purposes, yamahata, took, scores, of, photographs, and, on, 21, august, they, appeared, in, mainichi, shimbun, a, popular, japanese, newspaper, after, japan, s, surrender, and, the, arrival, of, american, forces, copies, of, his, photographs, were, seized, amid, the, ensuing, censorship, but, some, records, have, survived, leslie, nakashima, a, former, united, press, up, journalist, filed, the, first, personal, account, of, the, scene, to, appear, in, american, newspapers, he, observed, that, large, numbers, of, survivors, continued, to, die, from, what, later, became, recognized, as, radiation, poisoning, on, 31, august, the, new, york, times, published, an, abbreviated, version, of, his, 27, august, up, article, nearly, all, references, to, uranium, poisoning, were, omitted, an, editor, s, note, was, added, to, say, that, according, to, american, scientists, the, atomic, bomb, will, not, have, any, lingering, after, effects, wilfred, burchett, was, also, one, of, the, first, western, journalists, to, visit, hiroshima, after, the, bombing, he, arrived, alone, by, train, from, tokyo, on, 2, september, defying, the, traveling, ban, put, in, place, on, western, correspondents, burchett, s, dispatch, the, atomic, plague, was, printed, by, the, daily, express, newspaper, in, london, on, 5, september, 1945, the, reports, from, nakashima, and, burchett, informed, the, public, for, the, first, time, of, the, gruesome, effects, of, radiation, and, nuclear, fallout, radiation, burns, and, radiation, poisoning, sometimes, lasting, more, than, thirty, days, after, the, blast, burchett, especially, noted, that, people, were, dying, horribly, after, bleeding, from, orifices, and, their, flesh, would, rot, away, from, the, injection, holes, where, vitamin, a, was, administered, to, no, avail, the, new, york, times, then, apparently, reversed, course, and, ran, a, front, page, story, by, bill, lawrence, confirming, the, existence, of, a, terrifying, affliction, in, hiroshima, where, many, had, symptoms, such, as, hair, loss, and, vomiting, blood, before, dying, lawrence, had, gained, access, to, the, city, as, part, of, a, press, junket, promoting, the, u, s, army, air, force, some, reporters, were, horrified, by, the, scene, however, referring, to, what, they, saw, as, a, death, laboratory, littered, with, human, guinea, pigs, general, macarthur, found, the, reporting, to, have, turned, from, good, pr, into, bad, pr, and, threatened, to, court, martial, the, entire, group, he, withdrew, burchett, s, press, accreditation, and, expelled, the, journalist, from, the, occupation, zones, the, authorities, also, accused, him, of, being, under, the, sway, of, japanese, propaganda, and, later, suppressed, another, story, on, the, nagasaki, bombing, by, george, weller, of, the, chicago, daily, news, less, than, a, week, after, his, new, york, times, story, was, published, lawrence, also, backtracked, and, dismissed, the, reports, on, radiation, sickness, as, japanese, efforts, to, undermine, american, morale, a, member, of, the, united, states, strategic, bombing, survey, lieutenant, daniel, a, mcgovern, arrived, in, september, 1945, to, document, the, effects, of, the, bombing, of, japan, he, used, a, film, crew, to, document, the, effects, of, the, bombings, in, early, 1946, the, film, crew, shot, 27, 000, m, 90, 000, ft, of, film, resulting, in, a, three, hour, documentary, titled, the, effects, of, the, atomic, bombs, against, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, the, documentary, included, images, from, hospitals, burned, out, buildings, and, cars, and, rows, of, skulls, and, bones, on, the, ground, it, was, classified, secret, for, the, next, 22, years, motion, picture, company, nippon, eigasha, started, sending, cameramen, to, nagasaki, and, hiroshima, in, september, 1945, on, 24, october, 1945, a, u, s, military, policeman, stopped, a, nippon, eigasha, cameraman, from, continuing, to, film, in, nagasaki, all, nippon, eigasha, s, reels, were, confiscated, by, the, american, authorities, but, they, were, requested, by, the, japanese, government, and, declassified, the, public, release, of, film, footage, of, the, city, post, attack, and, some, research, about, the, effects, of, the, attack, was, restricted, during, the, occupation, of, japan, but, the, hiroshima, based, magazine, chugoku, bunka, in, its, first, issue, published, on, 10, march, 1946, devoted, itself, to, detailing, the, damage, from, the, bombing, the, book, hiroshima, written, by, pulitzer, prize, winner, john, hersey, and, originally, published, in, article, form, in, the, new, yorker, is, reported, to, have, reached, tokyo, in, english, by, january, 1947, and, the, translated, version, was, released, in, japan, in, 1949, it, narrated, the, stories, of, the, lives, of, six, bomb, survivors, from, immediately, prior, to, and, months, after, the, dropping, of, the, little, boy, bomb, beginning, in, 1974, a, compilation, of, drawings, and, artwork, made, by, the, survivors, of, the, bombings, began, to, be, compiled, with, completion, in, 1977, and, under, both, book, and, exhibition, format, it, was, titled, the, unforgettable, fire, the, bombing, amazed, otto, hahn, and, other, german, atomic, scientists, whom, the, british, held, at, farm, hall, in, operation, epsilon, hahn, stated, that, he, had, not, believed, an, atomic, weapon, would, be, possible, for, another, twenty, years, werner, heisenberg, did, not, believe, the, news, at, first, carl, friedrich, von, weizs, cker, said, i, think, it, s, dreadful, of, the, americans, to, have, done, it, i, think, it, is, madness, on, their, part, but, heisenberg, replied, one, could, equally, well, say, that, s, the, quickest, way, of, ending, the, war, hahn, was, grateful, that, the, german, project, had, not, succeeded, in, developing, such, an, inhumane, weapon, karl, wirtz, observed, that, even, if, it, had, we, would, have, obliterated, london, but, would, still, not, have, conquered, the, world, and, then, they, would, have, dropped, them, on, us, hahn, told, the, others, once, i, wanted, to, suggest, that, all, uranium, should, be, sunk, to, the, bottom, of, the, ocean, the, vatican, agreed, l, osservatore, romano, expressed, regret, that, the, bomb, s, inventors, did, not, destroy, the, weapon, for, the, benefit, of, humanity, rev, cuthbert, thicknesse, the, dean, of, st, albans, prohibited, using, st, albans, abbey, for, a, thanksgiving, service, for, the, war, s, end, calling, the, use, of, atomic, weapons, an, act, of, wholesale, indiscriminate, massacre, nonetheless, news, of, the, atomic, bombing, was, greeted, enthusiastically, in, the, u, s, a, poll, in, fortune, magazine, in, late, 1945, showed, a, significant, minority, of, americans, 23, percent, wishing, that, more, atomic, bombs, could, have, been, dropped, on, japan, the, initial, positive, response, was, supported, by, the, imagery, presented, to, the, public, mainly, the, powerful, images, of, the, mushroom, cloud, during, this, time, in, america, it, was, a, common, practice, for, editors, to, keep, graphic, images, of, death, out, of, films, magazines, and, newspapers, an, estimated, 90, 000, to, 166, 000, people, in, hiroshima, between, 26, and, 49, percent, of, its, population, and, 60, 000, to, 80, 000, people, in, nagasaki, between, 22, and, 32, percent, of, its, population, died, in, 1945, of, which, a, majority, in, each, case, were, killed, on, the, days, of, the, bombings, due, to, the, force, and, heat, of, the, blasts, themselves, nearly, all, of, the, remainder, of, victims, died, within, two, to, four, months, due, to, radiation, exposure, and, resulting, complications, one, atomic, bomb, casualty, commission, report,

from, the, blast, and, heat, but, died, from, complications, frequently, compounded, by, acute, radiation, syndrome, ars, all, within, about, 20, to, 30, days, many, people, not, injured, by, the, blast, eventually, died, within, that, timeframe, as, well, after, suffering, from, ars, at, the, time, the, doctors, had, no, idea, what, the, cause, was, and, were, unable, to, effectively, treat, the, condition, midori, naka, was, the, first, death, officially, certified, to, be, the, result, of, radiation, poisoning, or, as, it, was, referred, to, by, many, the, atomic, bomb, disease, she, was, some, 650, meters, 2, 130, ft, from, the, hypocenter, at, hiroshima, and, would, die, on, 24, august, 1945, after, traveling, to, tokyo, it, was, unappreciated, at, the, time, but, the, average, radiation, dose, that, would, kill, approximately, 50, percent, of, adults, the, ld50, was, approximately, halved, that, is, smaller, doses, were, made, more, lethal, when, the, individual, experienced, concurrent, blast, or, burn, polytraumatic, injuries, conventional, skin, injuries, that, cover, a, large, area, frequently, result, in, bacterial, infection, the, risk, of, sepsis, and, death, is, increased, when, a, usually, non, lethal, radiation, dose, moderately, suppresses, the, white, blood, cell, count, in, the, spring, of, 1948, the, atomic, bomb, casualty, commission, abcc, was, established, in, accordance, with, a, presidential, directive, from, truman, to, the, national, academy, of, sciences, national, research, council, to, conduct, investigations, of, the, late, effects, of, radiation, among, the, survivors, in, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, in, 1956, the, abcc, published, the, effect, of, exposure, to, the, atomic, bombs, on, pregnancy, termination, in, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, the, abcc, became, the, radiation, effects, research, foundation, rerf, on, 1, april, 1975, a, binational, organization, run, by, both, the, united, states, and, japan, the, rerf, is, still, in, operation, today, cancers, do, not, immediately, emerge, after, exposure, to, radiation, instead, radiation, induced, cancer, has, a, minimum, latency, period, of, some, five, years, and, above, and, leukemia, some, two, years, and, above, peaking, around, six, to, eight, years, later, jarrett, foley, published, the, first, major, reports, on, the, significant, increased, incidence, of, the, latter, among, survivors, almost, all, cases, of, leukemia, over, the, following, 50, years, were, in, people, exposed, to, more, than, 1, gy, in, a, strictly, dependent, manner, dependent, on, their, distance, from, the, hypocenter, in, the, 1987, life, span, study, conducted, by, the, radiation, effects, research, foundation, a, statistical, excess, of, 507, cancers, of, undefined, lethality, were, observed, in, 79, 972, hibakusha, who, had, still, been, living, between, 1958, and, 1987, and, who, took, part, in, the, study, as, the, epidemiology, study, continues, with, time, the, rerf, estimates, that, from, 1950, to, 2000, 46, percent, of, leukemia, deaths, which, may, include, sadako, sasaki, and, 11, percent, of, solid, cancers, of, unspecified, lethality, were, likely, due, to, radiation, from, the, bombs, or, some, other, post, attack, city, effects, with, the, statistical, excess, being, 200, leukemia, deaths, and, 1, 700, solid, cancers, of, undeclared, lethality, both, of, these, statistics, being, derived, from, the, observation, of, approximately, half, of, the, total, survivors, strictly, those, who, took, part, in, the, study, a, meta, analysis, from, 2016, found, that, radiation, exposure, increases, cancer, risk, but, also, that, the, average, lifespan, of, survivors, was, reduced, by, only, a, few, months, compared, to, those, not, exposed, to, radiation, while, during, the, preimplantation, period, that, is, one, to, ten, days, following, conception, intrauterine, radiation, exposure, of, at, least, 0, 2, gy, can, cause, complications, of, implantation, and, death, of, the, human, embryo, the, number, of, miscarriages, caused, by, the, radiation, from, the, bombings, during, this, radiosensitive, period, is, not, known, one, of, the, early, studies, conducted, by, the, abcc, was, on, the, outcome, of, pregnancies, occurring, in, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, and, in, a, control, city, kure, located, 29, km, 18, mi, south, of, hiroshima, to, discern, the, conditions, and, outcomes, related, to, radiation, exposure, james, v, neel, led, the, study, which, found, that, the, overall, number, of, birth, defects, was, not, significantly, higher, among, the, children, of, survivors, who, were, pregnant, at, the, time, of, the, bombings, he, also, studied, the, longevity, of, the, children, who, survived, the, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, reporting, that, between, 90, and, 95, percent, were, still, living, 50, years, later, while, the, national, academy, of, sciences, raised, the, possibility, that, neel, s, procedure, did, not, filter, the, kure, population, for, possible, radiation, exposure, which, could, bias, the, results, overall, a, statistically, insignificant, increase, in, birth, defects, occurred, directly, after, the, bombings, of, nagasaki, and, hiroshima, when, the, cities, were, taken, as, wholes, in, terms, of, distance, from, the, hypocenters, however, neel, and, others, noted, that, in, approximately, 50, humans, who, were, of, an, early, gestational, age, at, the, time, of, the, bombing, and, who, were, all, within, about, 1, kilometer, 0, 62, mi, of, the, hypocenter, an, increase, in, microencephaly, and, anencephaly, was, observed, upon, birth, with, the, incidence, of, these, two, particular, malformations, being, nearly, 3, times, what, was, to, be, expected, when, compared, to, the, control, group, in, kure, in, 1985, johns, hopkins, university, geneticist, james, f, crow, examined, neel, s, research, and, confirmed, that, the, number, of, birth, defects, was, not, significantly, higher, in, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, many, members, of, the, abcc, and, its, successor, radiation, effects, research, foundation, rerf, were, still, looking, for, possible, birth, defects, among, the, survivors, decades, later, but, found, no, evidence, that, they, were, significantly, common, among, the, survivors, or, inherited, in, the, children, of, survivors, despite, the, small, sample, size, of, 1, 600, to, 1, 800, persons, who, came, forth, as, prenatally, exposed, at, the, time, of, the, bombings, that, were, both, within, a, close, proximity, to, the, two, hypocenters, to, survive, the, in, utero, absorption, of, a, substantial, dose, of, radiation, and, then, the, malnourished, post, attack, environment, data, from, this, cohort, do, support, the, increased, risk, of, severe, mental, retardation, smr, that, was, observed, in, some, 30, individuals, with, smr, being, a, common, outcome, of, the, aforementioned, microencephaly, while, a, lack, of, statistical, data, with, just, 30, individuals, out, of, 1, 800, prevents, a, definitive, determination, of, a, threshold, point, the, data, collected, suggests, a, threshold, intrauterine, or, fetal, dose, for, smr, at, the, most, radiosensitive, period, of, cognitive, development, when, there, is, the, largest, number, of, undifferentiated, neural, cells, 8, to, 15, weeks, post, conception, to, begin, at, a, threshold, dose, of, approximately, 0, 09, to, 0, 15, gy, with, the, risk, then, linearly, increasing, to, a, 43, percent, rate, of, smr, when, exposed, to, a, fetal, dose, of, 1, gy, at, any, point, during, these, weeks, of, rapid, neurogenesis, however, either, side, of, this, radiosensitive, age, none, of, the, prenatally, exposed, to, the, bombings, at, an, age, less, than, 8, weeks, that, is, prior, to, synaptogenesis, or, at, a, gestational, age, more, than, 26, weeks, were, observed, to, be, mentally, retarded, with, the, condition, therefore, being, isolated, to, those, solely, of, 8, 26, weeks, of, age, and, who, absorbed, more, than, approximately, 0, 09, to, 0, 15, gy, of, prompt, radiation, energy, examination, of, the, prenatally, exposed, in, terms, of, iq, performance, and, school, records, determined, the, beginning, of, a, statistically, significant, reduction, in, both, when, exposed, to, greater, than, 0, 1, to, 0, 5, gray, during, the, same, gestational, period, of, 8, 25, weeks, however, outside, this, period, at, less, than, 8, weeks, and, greater, than, 26, after, conception, there, is, no, evidence, of, a, radiation, related, effect, on, scholastic, performance, the, reporting, of, doses, in, terms, of, absorbed, energy, in, units, of, grays, and, rads, rather, than, the, biologically, significant, biologically, weighted, sievert, in, both, the, smr, and, cognitive, performance, data, is, typical, the, reported, threshold, dose, variance, between, the, two, cities, is, suggested, to, be, a, manifestation, of, the, difference, between, x, ray, and, neutron, absorption, with, little, boy, emitting, substantially, more, neutron, flux, whereas, the, baratol, that, surrounded, the, core, of, fat, man, filtered, or, shifted, the, absorbed, neutron, radiation, profile, so, that, the, dose, of, radiation, energy, received, in, nagasaki, was, mostly, that, from, exposure, to, x, rays, gamma, rays, contrast, this, to, the, environment, within, 1500, meters, of, the, hypocenter, at, hiroshima, where, the, in, utero, dose, depended, more, on, the, absorption, of, neutrons, which, have, a, higher, biological, effect, per, unit, of, energy, absorbed, from, the, radiation, dose, reconstruction, work, the, estimated, dosimetry, at, hiroshima, still, has, the, largest, uncertainty, as, the, little, boy, bomb, design, was, never, tested, before, deployment, or, afterward, as, such, the, estimated, radiation, profile, absorbed, by, individuals, at, hiroshima, had, required, greater, reliance, on, calculations, than, the, japanese, soil, concrete, and, roof, tile, measurements, which, began, to, reach, accurate, levels, and, thereby, inform, researchers, in, the, 1990s, many, other, investigations, into, cognitive, outcomes, such, as, schizophrenia, as, a, result, of, prenatal, exposure, have, been, conducted, with, no, statistically, significant, linear, relationship, seen, there, is, a, suggestion, that, in, the, most, extremely, exposed, those, who, survived, within, a, kilometer, or, so, of, the, hypocenters, a, trend, emerges, akin, to, that, seen, in, smr, though, the, sample, size, is, too, small, to, determine, with, any, significance, the, survivors, of, the, bombings, are, called, hibakusha, pronounced, or, a, japanese, word, that, translates, to, explosion, affected, people, the, japanese, government, has, recognized, about, 650, 000, people, as, hibakusha, as, of, 31, march, 2024, 106, 825, were, still, alive, mostly, in, japan, the, government, of, japan, recognizes, about, one, percent, of, these, as, having, illnesses, caused, by, radiation, the, memorials, in, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, contain, lists, of, the, names, of, the, hibakusha, who, are, known, to, have, died, since, the, bombings, updated, annually, on, the, anniversaries, of, the, bombings, as, of, august, 2024, the, memorials, record, the, names, of, more, than, 540, 000, hibakusha, 344, 306, in, hiroshima, and, 198, 785, in, nagasaki, if, they, discuss, their, background, hibakusha, and, their, children, were, and, still, are, victims, of, fear, based, discrimination, and, exclusion, for, marriage, or, work, due, to, public, ignorance, much, of, the, public, persist, with, the, belief, that, the, hibakusha, carry, some, hereditary, or, even, contagious, disease, this, is, despite, the, fact, that, no, statistically, demonstrable, increase, of, birth, defects, congenital, malformations, was, found, among, the, later, conceived, children, born, to, survivors, of, the, nuclear, weapons, used, at, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, or, has, been, found, in, the, later, conceived, children, of, cancer, survivors, who, had, previously, received, radiotherapy, the, surviving, women, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, that, could, conceive, who, were, exposed, to, substantial, amounts, of, radiation, had, children, with, no, higher, incidence, of, abnormalities, birth, defects, than, the, rate, which, is, observed, in, the, japanese, average, a, study, of, the, long, term, psychological, effects, of, the, bombings, on, the, survivors, found, that, even, 17, 20, years, after, the, bombings, had, occurred, survivors, showed, a, higher, prevalence, of, anxiety, and, somatization, symptoms, perhaps, as, many, as, 200, people, from, hiroshima, sought, refuge, in, nagasaki, the, 2006, documentary, twice, survived, the, doubly, atomic, bombed, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, documented, 165, nij, hibakusha, lit, double, explosion, affected, people, nine, of, whom, claimed, to, be, in, the, blast, zone, in, both, cities, on, 24, march, 2009, the, japanese, government, officially, recognized, tsutomu, yamaguchi, as, a, double, hibakusha, he, was, confirmed, to, be, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, from, ground, zero, in, hiroshima, on, a, business, trip, when, the, bomb, was, detonated, he, was, seriously, burnt, on, his, left, side, and, spent, the, night, in, hiroshima, he, arrived, at, his, home, city, of, nagasaki, on, 8, august, the, day, before, the, bombing, and, he, was, exposed, to, residual, radiation, while, searching, for, his, relatives, he, was, the, first, officially, recognized, survivor, of, both, bombings, he, died, in, 2010, of, stomach, cancer, during, the, war, japan, brought, as, many, as, 670, 000, korean, conscripts, to, japan, to, work, as, forced, labor, about, 5, 000, 8, 000, koreans, were, killed, in, hiroshima, and, 1, 500, 2, 000, in, nagasaki, korean, survivors, had, a, difficult, time, fighting, for, the, same, recognition, as, hibakusha, as, afforded, to, all, japanese, survivors, a, situation, which, resulted, in, the, denial, of, free, health, benefits, to, them, in, japan, most, issues, were, eventually, addressed, in, 2008, through, lawsuits, hiroshima, was, subsequently, struck, by, typhoon, ida, on, 17, september, 1945, more, than, half, the, bridges, were, destroyed, and, the, roads, and, railroads, were, damaged, further, devastating, the, city, the, population, increased, from, 83, 000, soon, after, the, bombing, to, 146, 000, in, february, 1946, the, city, was, rebuilt, after, the, war, with, help, from, the, national, government, through, the, hiroshima, peace, memorial, city, construction, law, passed, in, 1949, it, provided, financial, assistance, for, reconstruction, along, with, land, donated, that, was, previously, owned, by, the, national, government, and, used, for, military, purposes, in, 1949, a, design, was, selected, for, the, hiroshima, peace, memorial, park, hiroshima, prefectural, industrial, promotion, hall, the, closest, surviving, building, to, the, location, of, the, bomb, s, detonation, was, designated, the, hiroshima, peace, memorial, the, hiroshima, peace, memorial, museum, was, opened, in, 1955, in, the, peace, park, hiroshima, also, contains, a, peace, pagoda, built, in, 1966, by, nipponzan, my, h, ji, on, january, 27, 1981, the, atomic, bombing, relic, selecting, committee, of, hiroshima, announced, to, build, commemorative, plaques, at, nine, historical, sites, related, to, the, bombing, in, the, year, genbaku, dome, shima, hospital, hypocenter, motoyasu, bridge, all, unveiled, plaques, with, historical, photographs, and, descriptions, the, rest, sites, planned, including, hond, shopping, street, motomachi, no, 2, army, hospital, site, hiroshima, red, cross, hospital, fukuromachi, elementary, school, hiroshima, city, hall, and, hiroshima, station, the, committee, also, planned, to, establish, 30, commemorative, plaques, in, three, years, nagasaki, was, rebuilt, in, dramatically, changed, form, after, the, war, the, pace, of, reconstruction, was, initially, slow, and, the, first, simple, emergency, dwellings, were, not, provided, until, 1946, the, focus, on, redevelopment, was, the, replacement, of, war, industries, with, foreign, trade, shipbuilding, and, fishing, this, was, formally, declared, when, the, nagasaki, international, culture, city, reconstruction, law, was, passed, in, may, 1949, new, temples, were, built, as, well, as, new, churches, owing, to, an, increase, in, the, presence, of, christianity, the, nagasaki, atomic, bomb, museum, opened, in, the, mid, 1990s, some, of, the, rubble, was, left, as, a, memorial, such, as, a, torii, at, sann, shrine, and, an, arch, near, ground, zero, in, 2013, four, locations, were, designated, registered, monuments, to, provide, legal, protection, against, future, development, these, four, sites, together, with, ground, zero, the, hypocenter, of, the, atomic, bomb, explosion, were, collectively, designated, a, national, historic, site, in, 2016, these, sites, include, the, role, of, the, bombings, in, japan, s, surrender, and, the, ethical, legal, and, military, controversies, surrounding, the, united, states, justification, for, them, have, been, the, subject, of, scholarly, and, popular, debate, on, one, hand, it, has, been, argued, that, the, bombings, caused, the, japanese, surrender, thereby, preventing, casualties, that, an, invasion, of, japan, would, have, involved, stimson, talked, of, saving, one, million, casualties, the, naval, blockade, might, have, starved, the, japanese, into, submission, without, an, invasion, but, this, would, also, have, resulted, in, many, more, japanese, deaths, however, critics, of, the, bombings, have, asserted, that, atomic, weapons, are, fundamentally, immoral, that, the, bombings, were, war, crimes, and, that, they, constituted, state, terrorism, the, japanese, may, have, surrendered, without, the, bombings, but, only, an, unconditional, surrender, would, satisfy, the, allies, others, such, as, historian, tsuyoshi, hasegawa, argued, that, the, entry, of, the, soviet, union, into, the, war, against, japan, played, a, much, greater, role, than, the, atomic, bombs, in, inducing, japan, to, surrender, because, it, dashed, any, hope, that, japan, could, terminate, the, war, through, moscow, s, mediation, a, view, among, critics, of, the, bombings, popularized, by, american, historian, gar, alperovitz, in, 1965, is, that, the, united, states, used, nuclear, weapons, to, intimidate, the, soviet, union, in, the, early, stages, of, the, cold, war, james, orr, wrote, that, this, idea, became, the, accepted, position, in, japan, and, that, it, may, have, played, some, part, in, the, decision, making, of, the, us, government, on, 10, august, 1945, after, hearing, about, the, soviet, union, s, attack, on, manchuria, and, the, opinion, of, the, supreme, council, emperor, hirohito, issued, a, statement, i, have, thought, about, it, carefully, the, russians, have, joined, the, war, japan, is, in, a, situation, of, two, fronts, with, both, sides, being, attacked, only, one, solution, proposed, by, prime, minister, suzuki, surrender, can, find, a, way, out, 290, according, to, a, 2013, study, by, ward, wilson, an, american, japan, s, surrender, was, mainly, caused, by, the, soviet, union, s, manchurian, campaign, not, by, the, two, atomic, bombs, of, the, us, according, to, ward, wilson, the, japanese, supreme, council, s, decision, to, surrender, was, decided, on, august, 9, japan, time, while, the, bombing, of, nagasaki, took, place, in, the, late, morning, of, august, 9, after, the, supreme, council, began, a, meeting, to, discuss, surrender, ward, wilson, believes, that, the, bombing, of, hiroshima, was, not, the, reason, for, japan, s, surrender, because, the, preliminary, report, of, the, japanese, army, investigation, team, on, the, bombing, of, hiroshima, was, not, submitted, until, august, 10, ward, wilson, believes, that, japan, decided, to, surrender, long, before, its, leaders, realized, the, devastation, caused, by, the, atomic, bombs, on, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, according, to, ward, wilson, japanese, leaders, had, long, concluded, it, is, possible, to, fight, a, decisive, battle, against, a, great, power, attacking, from, one, direction, but, it, is, impossible, to, repel, two, great, powers, attacking, from, two, different, directions, at, a, meeting, of, the, supreme, council, in, june, 1945, they, said, that, soviet, participation, in, the, war, will, decide, the, fate, of, the, entire, empire, at, the, same, meeting, deputy, general, staff, of, the, army, kawabe, said, that, maintaining, absolute, peace, in, our, relations, with, the, soviet, union, is, extremely, important, if, we, want, to, continue, the, war, according, to, ward, wilson, the, soviet, union, s, manchurian, campaign, destroyed, all, hope, of, japanese, resistance, even, though, they, did, not, know, about, the, us, atomic, bombing, on, august, 6, 1945, after, the, atomic, bombing, of, hiroshima, us, president, harry, s, truman, broadcast, on, the, radio, calling, for, japan, s, surrender, president, truman, talked, about, the, atomic, bomb, and, threatened, that, if, japan, did, not, surrender, disasters, like, hiroshima, would, continue, and, truman, s, announcement, was, delivered, by, prince, koichi, kido, to, the, emperor, of, japan, at, 1, 30, p, m, on, august, 7, however, the, japanese, leadership, and, almost, the, entire, world, at, that, time, did, not, understand, what, the, concept, of, an, atomic, bomb, was, the, destruction, of, a, city, is, shocking, news, in, times, of, peace, but, in, the, context, of, 1945, dozens, of, japanese, cities, such, as, tokyo, osaka, yokohama, were, completely, destroyed, by, american, bombers, during, the, previous, months, the, bombing, of, tokyo, alone, had, killed, more, than, 100, 000, civilians, in, just, one, day, so, the, destruction, of, hiroshima, and, truman, s, vague, threat, did, not, make, much, impression, on, the, japanese, commander, ward, wilson, argued, that, the, japanese, imperial, supreme, council, s, cancellation, of, the, meeting, about, the, bombing, of, hiroshima, proved, that, council, members, did, not, consider, this, bombing, more, serious, than, previous, incidents, in, ward, wilson, s, view, the, soviet, campaign, had, a, decisive, strategic, significance, in, causing, japan, to, surrender, while, the, us, atomic, bombing, did, not, the, motivation, for, the, japanese, empire, to, surrender, according, to, ward, wilson, was, not, from, the, atomic, bombing, by, the, united, states, but, was, actually, due, to, the, effects, of, the, soviet, union, declaring, war, on, japan, this, is, reinforced, by, ward, wilson, with, arguments, such, as, the, hague, conventions, of, 1899, and, 1907, which, address, the, codes, of, wartime, conduct, on, land, and, at, sea, were, adopted, before, the, rise, of, air, power, despite, repeated, diplomatic, attempts, to, update, international, humanitarian, law, to, include, aerial, warfare, it, was, not, updated, before, world, war, ii, the, absence, of, specific, international, humanitarian, law, did, not, mean, aerial, warfare, was, not, covered, under, the, laws, of, war, but, rather, that, there, was, no, general, agreement, of, how, to, interpret, those, laws, this, means, that, aerial, bombardment, of, civilian, areas, in, enemy, territory, by, all, major, belligerents, during, world, war, ii, was, not, prohibited, by, positive, or, specific, customary, international, humanitarian, law, in, 1963, the, bombings, were, subjected, to, judicial, review, in, ryuichi, shimoda, v, the, state, the, district, court, of, tokyo, ruled, the, use, of, nuclear, weapons, in, warfare, was, not, illegal, but, held, in, its, obiter, dictum, that, the, atomic, bombings, of, both, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, were, illegal, under, international, law, of, that, time, as, an, indiscriminate, bombardment, of, undefended, cities, the, court, denied, the, appellants, compensation, on, the, grounds, that, the, japanese, government, had, waived, the, right, for, reparations, from, the, u, s, government, under, the, treaty, of, san, francisco, by, 30, june, 1946, there, were, components, for, nine, atomic, bombs, in, the, us, arsenal, all, fat, man, devices, identical, to, the, one, used, at, nagasaki, the, nuclear, weapons, were, handmade, devices, and, a, great, deal, of, work, remained, to, improve, their, ease, of, assembly, safety, reliability, and, storage, before, they, were, ready, for, production, there, were, also, many, improvements, to, their, performance, that, had, been, suggested, or, recommended, but, that, had, not, been, possible, under, the, pressure, of, wartime, development, the, chairman, of, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, fleet, admiral, william, d, leahy, decried, the, use, of, the, atomic, bombs, as, adopting, an, ethical, standard, common, to, the, barbarians, of, the, dark, ages, but, in, october, 1947, he, reported, a, military, requirement, for, 400, bombs, the, american, monopoly, on, nuclear, weapons, lasted, four, years, before, the, soviet, union, detonated, an, atomic, bomb, in, september, 1949, the, united, states, responded, with, the, development, of, the, hydrogen, bomb, a, thousand, times, as, powerful, as, the, bombs, that, devastated, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, such, ordinary, fission, bombs, would, henceforth, be, regarded, as, small, tactical, nuclear, weapons, by, 1986, the, united, states, had, 23, 317, nuclear, weapons, and, the, soviet, union, had, 40, 159, in, early, 2019, more, than, 90, of, the, world, s, 13, 865, nuclear, weapons, were, owned, by, the, united, states, and, russia, by, 2020, nine, nations, had, nuclear, weapons, but, japan, was, not, one, of, them, japan, reluctantly, signed, the, treaty, on, the, non, proliferation, of, nuclear, weapons, in, february, 1970, but, is, still, sheltered, under, the, american, nuclear, umbrella, american, nuclear, weapons, were, stored, on, okinawa, and, sometimes, in, japan, itself, albeit, in, contravention, of, agreements, between, the, two, nations, lacking, the, resources, to, fight, the, soviet, union, using, conventional, forces, nato, came, to, depend, on, the, use, of, nuclear, weapons, to, defend, itself, during, the, cold, war, a, policy, that, became, known, in, the, 1950s, as, the, new, look, in, the, decades, after, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, the, united, states, would, threaten, many, times, to, use, its, nuclear, weapons, on, 7, july, 2017, more, than, 120, countries, voted, to, adopt, the, un, treaty, on, the, prohibition, of, nuclear, weapons, elayne, whyte, g, mez, president, of, the, un, negotiations, said, the, world, has, been, waiting, for, this, legal, norm, for, 70, years, as, of, 2023, japan, has, not, signed, the, treaty
