archaeological, soundings, the, site, was, occupied, beginning, in, the, eighth, millennium, bc, essentially, all, archaeology, has, focused, on, the, late, bronze, levels, so, little, is, known, about, earlier, occupation, in, the, middle, bronze, evidence, indicate, that, ugarit, had, contacts, with, the, egyptian, middle, kingdom, a, carnelian, bead, can, be, inscribed, with, the, name, of, senusret, i, a, stela, and, a, statuette, from, the, egyptian, pharaohs, senusret, iii, and, amenemhet, iii, have, also, been, found, however, it, is, unclear, at, what, time, these, monuments, were, brought, to, ugarit, the, city, reached, its, golden, age, between, 1500, bc, and, 1200, bc, when, it, ruled, a, trade, based, coastal, kingdom, trading, with, egypt, cyprus, the, aegean, primarily, crete, syria, the, hittites, cities, of, the, levant, including, ashkelon, and, much, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, five, of, the, amarna, letters, found, in, akhenaten, s, capital, of, egypt, from, the, mid, 14th, century, bce, were, written, in, ugarit, most, of, the, letters, were, broken, and, their, reading, proved, difficult, but, some, information, was, recovered, the, population, of, ugarit, in, this, period, is, estimated, to, be, between, 7, 000, and, 8, 000, individuals, the, kingdom, of, ugarit, controlled, about, 2, 000, km, 2, on, average, in, the, mid, 14th, century,

reign, of, his, son, niqmaddu, ii, c, 1350, 1315, bc, ugarit, became, a, vassal, of, the, hittite, empire, mainly, through, the, hittite, ruler, s, viceroy, in, karkemi, and, then, with, the, hititte, collapse, directly, under, karkemi, diplomatic, relations, with, egypt, continued, as, evidenced, by, two, letters, send, by, niqmaddu, ii, ea49, and, his, wife, eba, ea48, probably, sent, to, akhenaten, 1351, 1334, bc, the, former, includes, a, request, from, the, egyptian, king, to, send, a, physician, to, ugarit, sea, peoples, victory, from, the, late, 13th, century, into, the, early, 12th, century, bc, the, entire, region, based, on, contemporary, texts, including, hititte, areas, the, levant, and, the, eastern, mediterranean, faced, severe, and, widespread, food, shortages, potentially, from, plant, diseases, ugarit, received, a, number, of, desperate, pleas, for, food, from, other, realms, the, food, shortage, eventually, reached, ugarit, previously, a, major, supplier, and, transporter, of, food, supplies, a, letter, from, egyptian, pharaoh, merenptah, referred, to, a, missive, sent, by, the, ruler, of, ugarit, so, you, had, written, to, me, could, i, not, have, demanded, my, needs, the, great, king, the, king, of, egypt, my, lord, i, demand, this, request, the, land, of, ugarit, there, is, a, severe, hunger, bi, ru, dan, ni, may, my, lord, save, and, may,

contemporary, of, the, last, known, hittite, king, suppiluliuma, ii, the, exact, dates, of, his, reign, are, unknown, however, a, letter, by, the, king, is, preserved, in, which, ammurapi, stresses, the, seriousness, of, the, crisis, faced, by, many, near, eastern, states, due, to, attacks, at, this, time, ugarit, possessed, a, large, army, and, navy, and, both, joined, with, hittite, forces, to, try, and, stem, the, oncoming, enemy, eventually, having, to, fall, back, from, anatolia, to, the, syrian, border, ammurapi, s, response, to, an, appeal, for, assistance, from, the, king, of, alashiya, highlights, the, desperate, situation, that, ugarit, and, other, cities, faced, my, father, behold, the, enemy, s, ships, came, here, my, cities, were, burned, and, they, did, evil, things, in, my, country, does, not, my, father, know, that, all, my, troops, and, chariots, are, in, the, land, of, hatti, and, all, my, ships, are, in, the, land, of, lukka, thus, the, country, is, abandoned, to, itself, may, my, father, know, it, the, seven, ships, of, the, enemy, that, came, here, inflicted, much, damage, upon, us, eshuwara, the, senior, governor, of, cyprus, responded, as, for, the, matter, concerning, those, enemies, it, was, the, people, from, your, country, and, your, own, ships, who, did, this, and, it, was, the, people, from, your, country, who, committed, these, transgression, s, i, am, writing, to, inform, you, and, protect, you, be, aware, at, the, end, ammurapi, begs, for, forces, from, the, hittite, viceroy, at, carchemish, the, enemy, having, captured, ugarit, s, other, port, ra, u, and, was, advancing, on, the, city, to, the, king, my, lord, say, thus, ammurapi, your, servant, i, wrote, you, twice, thrice, s, regarding, the, enemy, may, my, lord,

me, from, the, forces, of, this, enemy, the, ruler, of, carchemish, sent, troops, to, assist, ugarit, but, ugarit, had, been, sacked, a, letter, sent, after, ugarit, had, been, destroyed, said, when, your, messenger, arrived, the, army, was, humiliated, and, the, city, was, sacked, our, food, in, the, threshing, floors, was, burnt, and, the, vineyards, were, also, destroyed, our, city, is, sacked, may, you, know, it, may, you, know, it, by, excavating, the, highest, levels, of, the, city, s, ruins, archaeologists, have, studied, various, attributes, of, ugaritic, civilization, just, before, their, destruction, and, compared, artifacts, with, those, of, nearby, cultures, to, help, establish, dates, ugarit, contained, many, caches, of, cuneiform, tablets, inside, of, libraries, that, contained, a, wealth, of, valuable, information, the, destruction, levels, of, the, ruin, contained, late, helladic, iiib, pottery, ware, but, no, lh, iiic, see, mycenaean, period, therefore, the, date, of, the, destruction, of, ugarit, is, crucial, for, the, dating, of, the, lh, iiic, phase, in, mainland, greece, since, an, egyptian, sword, bearing, the, name, of, pharaoh, merneptah, was, found, in, the, destruction, levels, 1190, bc, was, taken, as, the, date, for, the, beginning, of, the, lh, iiic, a, cuneiform, tablet, found, in, 1986, shows, that, ugarit, was, destroyed, sometime, after, the, death, of, merneptah, 1203, bc, it, is, generally, agreed, that, ugarit, had, already, been, destroyed, by, the, eighth, year, of, ramesses, iii, 1178, bc, recent, radiocarbon, work, combined, with, other, historical, dates, and, the, eclipse, of, january, 21, 1192, indicates, a, destruction, date, between, 1192, and, 1190, bc, bay, an, official, of, the, egyptian, queen, twosret, in, a, tablet, rs, 86, 2230, found, at, ras, shamra, was, in, communication, with, ammurapi, the, last, ruler, of, ugarit, bay, was, in, office, from, approximately, 1194, 1190, bc, this, sets, an, upper, limit, on, the, destruction, date, of, ugarit, it, is, important, to, remember, that, the, chronology, of, the, ancient, near, east, and, that, of, the, ancient, egypt, are, not, yet, perfectly, synchronized, a, large, number, of, arrowheads, were, recovered, from, the, destruction, level, in, 2021, their, typology, has, not, been, published, as, yet, early, in, the, excavations, a, partial, text, of, the, ugarit, king, list, in, ugaritic, was, found, later, complete, renditions, in, akkadian, were, discovered, they, list, twenty, six, rulers, all, deified, only, the, later, rulers, are, supported, by, texts, or, known, synchronisms, given, that, ugarit, was, abandoned, between, the, middle, and, late, bronze, ages, it, is, thought, that, the, earliest, names, on, the, list, were, more, on, the, order, of, tribal, chiefs, than, kings, after, its, destruction, in, the, early, 12th, century, bc, ugarit, s, location, was, forgotten, until, 1928, when, a, peasant, accidentally, opened, an, old, tomb, while, plowing, a, field, at, that, time, the, region, was, part, of, the, alawite, state, not, in, syria, the, discovered, area, was, the, necropolis, of, ugarit, located, in, the, nearby, seaport, of, minet, el, beida, excavations, have, since, revealed, a, city, with, a, prehistory, reaching, back, to, c, 6000, bc, the, site, covers, an, area, of, about, 28, hectares, with, a, maximum, height, of, 20, meters, at, the, top, of, the, acropolis, the, site, is, surrounded, by, a, city, wall, with, one, known, fortified, gate, though, four, gates, are, believed, to, have, existed, since, the, late, bronze, age, about, 50, meters, have, been, eroded, from, the, north, end, of, the, site, by, the, nahr, chbayyeb, river, the, southern, slope, of, the, tell, is, covered, by, orange, groves, preventing, excavation, a, brief, investigation, of, a, looted, tomb, at, the, necropolis, of, minet, el, beida, was, conducted, by, l, on, alban, se, in, 1928, who, then, examined, the, main, mound, of, ras, shamra, beginning, in, 1929, excavations, of, ugarit, were, conducted, by, a, french, team, called, the, mission, de, ras, shamra, led, by, archaeologist, claude, schaeffer, from, the, mus, e, arch, ologique, in, strasbourg, work, continued, until, 1939, when, it, was, interrupted, by, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, the, french, excavation, now, the, mission, archeologique, frangaise, de, ras, shamra, ougarit, resumed, in, 1950, led, again, by, claude, schaeffer, until, 1970, at, that, point, directorship, passed, to, jean, margueron, after, 44, excavation, seasons, all, of, the, numerous, finds, and, their, findspots, were, collated, in, 2005, the, excavation, became, a, joint, french, and, syrian, effort, led, by, val, rie, mato, an, and, khozama, al, bahloul, these, continued, until, being, ended, due, to, the, syrian, civil, war, archaeologists, have, defined, a, number, of, occupation, strata, at, the, site, based, on, the, excavations, a, number, of, areas, lay, within, the, fortifications, of, ugarit, in, the, northwest, section, was, an, acropolis, with, the, temples, of, dagon, and, baal, in, the,

the, west, of, that, lies, the, modern, village, of, ras, shamra, there, were, densely, populated, residential, areas, to, the, east, of, the, royal, zone, and, on, the, southern, slope, of, the, tell, numerous, cuneiform, tablets, have, been, found, by, the, late, bronze, age, ugarit, had, a, thriving, dual, scribal, system, primarily, it, used, the, east, semitic, akkadian, language, which, acted, as, the, lingua, franca, throughout, the, region, for, diplomacy, business, and, administrative, purposes, in, parallel, there, was, scribal, activity, in, the, local, northwest, semitic, ugaritic, language, a, few, scribes, are, known, to, have, worked, in, both, writing, systems, a, number, of, archives, were, found, the, largest, being, that, of, the, household, of, urt, nu, a, merchant, with, trading, ties, as, far, afield, as, emar, this, area, of, the, tell, was, under, military, control, at, the, time, and, about, 100, tablets, were, found, in, the, rubble, from,

while, it, traditionally, has, been, assumed, that, syllabic, texts, are, in, the, akkadian, language, and, alphabetic, texts, are, in, ugaritic, it, has, been, suggested, that, much, of, the, syllabic, writing, especially, in, administrative, documents, is, actually, in, a, jargon, where, an, akkadian, dialect, is, hard, to, detect, given, the, great, amount, of, ugaritic, elements, it, contained, the, royal, palace, was, constructed, over, several, major, phases, between, the, 15th, and, 13th, centuries, bc, it, comprised, rooms, arranged, around, courtyards, encompassing, 6, 500,
