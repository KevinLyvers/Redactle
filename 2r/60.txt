the, history, of, portugal, can, be, traced, from, circa, 400, 000, years, ago, when, the, region, of, present, day, portugal, was, inhabited, by, homo, heidelbergensis, the, roman, conquest, of, the, iberian, peninsula, which, lasted, almost, two, centuries, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, provinces, of, lusitania, in, the, south, and, gallaecia, in, the, north, of, what, is, now, portugal, following, the, fall, of, rome, germanic, tribes, controlled, the, territory, between, the, 5th, and, 8th, centuries, including, the, kingdom, of, the, suebi, centred, in, braga, and, the, visigothic, kingdom, in, the, south, the, 711, 716, invasion, by, the, islamic, umayyad, caliphate, conquered, the, visigoth, kingdom, and, founded, the, islamic, state, of, al, andalus, gradually, advancing, through, iberia, in, 1095, portugal, broke, away, from, the, kingdom, of, galicia, afonso, henriques, son, of, the, count, henry, of, burgundy, proclaimed, himself, king, of, portugal, in, 1139, the, algarve, the, southernmost, province, of, portugal, was, conquered, from, the, moors, in, 1249, and, in, 1255, lisbon, became, the, capital, portugal, s, land, boundaries, have, remained, almost, unchanged, since, then, during, the, reign, of, king, john, i, the, portuguese, defeated, the, castilians, in, a, war, over, the, throne, 1385, and, established, a, political, alliance, with, england, by, the, treaty, of, windsor, in, 1386, from, the, late, middle, ages, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, portugal, ascended, to, the, status, of, a, world, power, during, europe, s, age, of, discovery, as, it, built, up, a, vast, empire, signs, of, military, decline, began, with, the, battle, of, alc, cer, quibir, in, morocco, in, 1578, this, defeat, led, to, the, death, of, king, sebastian, and, the, imprisonment, of, much, of, the, high, nobility, which, had, to, be, ransomed, at, great, cost, this, eventually, led, to, a, small, interruption, in, portugal, s, 800, year, old, independence, by, way, of, a, 60, year, dynastic, union, with, spain, between, 1580, and, the, beginning, of, the, portuguese, restoration, war, led, by, john, iv, in, 1640, spain, s, disastrous, defeat, in, its, attempt, to, conquer, england, in, 1588, by, means, of, the, invincible, armada, was, also, a, factor, as, portugal, had, to, contribute, ships, for, the, invasion, further, setbacks, included, the, destruction, of, much, of, its, capital, city, in, an, earthquake, in, 1755, occupation, during, the, napoleonic, wars, and, the, loss, of, its, largest, colony, brazil, in, 1822, from, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, to, the, late, 1950s, nearly, two, million, portuguese, left, portugal, to, live, in, brazil, and, the, united, states, in, 1910, a, revolution, deposed, the, monarchy, a, military, coup, in, 1926, installed, a, dictatorship, that, remained, until, another, coup, in, 1974, the, new, government, instituted, sweeping, democratic, reforms, and, granted, independence, to, all, of, portugal, s, african, colonies, in, 1975, portugal, is, a, founding, member, of, nato, the, organisation, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, oecd, the, european, free, trade, association, efta, and, the, community, of, portuguese, language, countries, it, entered, the, european, economic, community, now, the, european, union, in, 1986, the, word, portugal, derives, from, the, combined, roman, celtic, place, name, portus, cale, a, settlement, where, present, day, s, conurbation, of, porto, and, vila, nova, de, gaia, or, simply, gaia, stand, along, the, banks, of, river, douro, in, the, north, of, what, is, now, portugal, porto, stems, from, the, latin, word, for, port, or, harbour, portus, with, the, second, element, cale, s, meaning, and, precise, origin, being, less, clear, the, mainstream, explanation, points, to, an, ethnonym, derived, from, the, callaeci, also, known, as, the, gallaeci, peoples, who, occupied, the, north, west, of, the, iberian, peninsula, the, names, cale, and, callaici, are, the, origin, of, today, s, gaia, and, galicia, another, theory, proposes, that, cale, or, calle, is, a, derivation, of, the, celtic, word, for, port, like, the, irish, caladh, or, scottish, gaelic, cala, these, explanations, would, require, the, pre, roman, language, of, the, area, to, have, been, a, branch, of, q, celtic, which, is, not, generally, accepted, because, the, region, s, pre, roman, language, was, gallaecian, however, scholars, like, jean, markale, and, tranoy, propose, the, celtic, branches, all, share, the, same, origin, and, placenames, such, as, cale, gal, gaia, calais, galatia, galicia, gaelic, gael, gaul, latin, gallia, wales, cornwall, wallonia, and, others, all, stem, from, one, linguistic, root, cala, is, sometimes, considered, not, celtic, but, from, late, latin, calatum, calad, cala, compare, italian, cala, french, cale, itself, from, occitan, cala, cove, small, harbour, from, a, pre, indo, european, root, kal, cala, see, calanque, and, maybe, galici, a, callaeci, or, calaeci, another, theory, claims, it, derives, from, the, word, caladunum, in, fact, an, unattested, compound, caladunum, that, may, explain, the, toponym, calezun, in, gascony, a, further, explanation, proposes, gatelo, as, having, been, the, origin, of, present, day, braga, santiago, de, compostela, and, consequently, the, wider, regions, of, northern, portugal, and, galicia, a, different, theory, has, it, that, cala, was, the, name, of, a, celtic, goddess, drawing, a, comparison, with, the, gaelic, cailleach, a, supernatural, hag, some, french, scholars, believe, the, name, may, have, come, from, portus, gallus, the, port, of, the, gauls, or, celts, around, 200, bc, the, romans, took, the, iberian, peninsula, from, the, carthaginians, during, the, second, punic, war, in, the, process, they, conquered, cale, renaming, it, portus, cale, port, of, cale, and, incorporating, it, in, the, province, of, gaellicia, with, its, capital, in, bracara, augusta, modern, day, braga, portugal, during, the, middle, ages, the, region, around, portus, cale, became, known, by, the, suebi, and, visigoths, as, portucale, the, name, portucale, changed, into, portugale, during, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, by, the, 9th, century, portugale, was, used, extensively, to, refer, to, the, region, between, the, rivers, douro, and, minho, the, minho, flowing, along, what, would, become, the, northern, portugal, spain, border, by, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, portugale, portugallia, portvgallo, or, portvgalliae, was, already, referred, to, as, portugal, the, 14th, century, middle, french, name, for, the, country, portingal, which, added, an, intrusive, n, sound, through, the, process, of, excrescence, spread, to, middle, english, middle, english, variant, spellings, included, portingall, portingale, portyngale, and, portingaill, the, spelling, portyngale, is, found, in, chaucer, s, epilogue, to, the, nun, s, priest, s, tale, these, variants, survive, in, the, torrent, of, portyngale, a, middle, english, romance, composed, around, 1400, and, old, robin, of, portingale, an, english, child, ballad, portingal, and, variants, were, also, used, in, scots, and, survive, in, the, cornish, name, for, the, country, portyngal, the, early, history, of, portugal, is, shared, with, the, rest, of, the, iberian, peninsula, located, in, southwestern, europe, the, name, of, portugal, derives, from, the, joined, romano, celtic, name, portus, cale, the, region, was, settled, by, pre, celts, and, celts, giving, origin, to, peoples, like, the, gallaeci, lusitanians, celtici, and, cynetes, also, known, as, conii, some, coastal, areas, were, visited, by, phoenicians, carthaginians, and, ancient, greeks, it, was, incorporated, in, the, roman, republic, dominions, as, lusitania, and, part, of, gallaecia, after, 45, bc, until, 298, ad, the, region, of, present, day, portugal, was, inhabited, by, humans, since, circa, 400, 000, years, ago, when, homo, heidelbergensis, entered, the, area, the, oldest, human, fossil, found, in, portugal, is, the, 400, 000, year, old, aroeira, 3, h, heidelbergensis, skull, discovered, in, the, cave, of, aroeira, in, 2014, later, neanderthals, roamed, the, northern, iberian, peninsula, and, a, tooth, has, been, found, at, nova, da, columbeira, cave, in, estremadura, homo, sapiens, sapiens, arrived, in, portugal, around, 35, 000, years, ago, spreading, and, roaming, the, border, less, region, of, the, northern, iberian, peninsula, these, were, subsistence, societies, and, although, they, did, not, establish, prosperous, settlements, they, did, form, organized, societies, neolithic, portugal, experimented, with, domestication, of, herding, animals, the, raising, of, some, cereal, crops, and, fluvial, or, marine, fishing, pre, celtic, tribes, inhabited, portugal, leaving, a, cultural, footprint, the, cynetes, developed, a, written, language, leaving, many, stelae, which, are, mainly, found, in, the, south, of, portugal, early, in, the, first, millennium, bc, waves, of, celts, invaded, portugal, from, central, europe, and, inter, married, with, the, local, populations, forming, different, tribes, another, theory, suggests, that, celts, inhabited, western, iberia, portugal, well, before, any, large, celtic, migrations, from, central, europe, a, number, of, linguists, expert, in, ancient, celtic, have, presented, compelling, evidence, that, the, tartessian, language, once, spoken, in, parts, of, sw, spain, and, sw, portugal, is, at, least, proto, celtic, in, structure, the, celtic, presence, in, portugal, is, traceable, in, broad, outline, through, archaeological, and, linguistic, evidence, they, dominated, much, of, northern, and, central, portugal, but, in, the, south, they, were, unable, to, establish, their, stronghold, which, retained, its, non, indo, european, character, until, the, roman, conquest, in, southern, portugal, some, small, semi, permanent, commercial, coastal, settlements, were, also, founded, by, phoenician, carthaginians, modern, archaeology, and, research, shows, a, portuguese, root, to, the, celts, in, portugal, and, elsewhere, during, that, period, and, until, the, roman, invasions, the, castro, culture, a, variation, of, the, urnfield, culture, also, known, as, urnenfelderkultur, was, prolific, in, portugal, and, modern, galicia, this, culture, together, with, the, surviving, elements, of, the, atlantic, megalithic, culture, and, the, contributions, that, come, from, the, more, western, mediterranean, cultures, ended, up, in, what, has, been, called, the, cultura, castreja, or, castro, culture, this, designation, refers, to, the, characteristic, celtic, populations, called, d, n, d, in, or, don, in, gaelic, and, that, the, romans, called, castrae, in, their, chronicles, based, on, the, roman, chronicles, about, the, callaeci, peoples, along, with, the, lebor, gab, la, renn, narrations, and, the, interpretation, of, the, archaeological, remains, throughout, the, northern, half, of, portugal, and, galicia, it, is, possible, to, infer, that, there, was, a, matriarchal, society, with, a, military, and, religious, aristocracy, probably, of, the, feudal, type, the, figures, of, maximum, authority, were, the, chieftain, chefe, tribal, of, military, type, and, with, authority, in, his, castro, or, clan, and, the, druid, mainly, referring, to, medical, and, religious, functions, that, could, be, common, to, several, castros, the, celtic, cosmogony, remained, homogeneous, due, to, the, ability, of, the, druids, to, meet, in, councils, with, the, druids, of, other, areas, which, ensured, the, transmission, of, knowledge, and, the, most, significant, events, the, first, documentary, references, to, castro, society, are, provided, by, chroniclers, of, roman, military, campaigns, such, as, strabo, herodotus, and, pliny, the, elder, among, others, about, the, social, organization, and, describing, the, inhabitants, of, these, territories, the, gallaeci, of, northern, portugal, as, a, group, of, barbarians, who, spend, the, day, fighting, and, the, night, eating, drinking, and, dancing, under, the, moon, there, were, other, similar, tribes, and, chief, among, them, were, the, lusitanians, the, core, area, of, these, people, lay, in, inland, central, portugal, while, numerous, other, related, tribes, existed, such, as, the, celtici, of, alentejo, and, the, cynetes, or, conii, of, the, algarve, among, the, tribes, or, sub, divisions, were, the, bracari, coelerni, equaesi, grovii, interamici, leuni, luanqui, limici, narbasi, nemetati, paesuri, quaquerni, seurbi, tamagani, tapoli, turduli, turduli, veteres, turduli, oppidani, turodi, and, zoelae, a, few, small, semi, permanent, commercial, coastal, settlements, such, as, tavira, were, also, founded, in, the, algarve, region, by, phoenicians, carthaginians, numerous, pre, roman, peoples, of, the, iberian, peninsula, inhabited, the, territory, when, a, roman, invasion, occurred, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, the, romanization, of, hispania, took, several, centuries, the, roman, provinces, that, covered, present, day, portugal, were, lusitania, in, the, south, and, gallaecia, in, the, north, numerous, roman, sites, are, scattered, around, present, day, portugal, some, of, the, urban, remains, are, quite, large, such, as, con, mbriga, and, mir, briga, several, works, of, engineering, such, as, baths, temples, bridges, roads, circuses, theatres, and, layman, s, homes, are, preserved, throughout, the, country, coins, sarcophagi, and, ceramics, are, also, numerous, following, the, fall, of, rome, the, kingdom, of, the, suebi, and, the, visigothic, kingdom, controlled, the, territory, between, the, 5th, and, 8th, centuries, romanization, began, with, the, arrival, of, the, roman, army, in, the, iberian, peninsula, in, 218, bc, during, the, second, punic, war, against, carthage, the, romans, sought, to, conquer, lusitania, a, territory, that, included, all, of, modern, portugal, south, of, the, douro, river, and, spanish, extremadura, with, its, capital, at, emerita, augusta, now, m, rida, mining, was, the, primary, factor, that, made, the, romans, interested, in, conquering, the, region, one, of, rome, s, strategic, objectives, was, to, cut, off, carthaginian, access, to, the, iberian, copper, tin, gold, and, silver, mines, the, romans, intensely, exploited, the, aljustrel, vipasca, and, santo, domingo, mines, in, the, iberian, pyrite, belt, which, extends, to, seville, while, the, south, of, what, is, now, portugal, was, relatively, easily, occupied, by, the, romans, the, conquest, of, the, north, was, achieved, only, with, difficulty, due, to, resistance, from, serra, da, estrela, by, celts, and, lusitanians, led, by, viriatus, who, managed, to, resist, roman, expansion, for, years, viriatus, a, shepherd, from, serra, da, estrela, who, was, expert, in, guerrilla, tactics, waged, relentless, war, against, the, romans, defeating, several, successive, roman, generals, until, he, was, assassinated, in, 140, bc, by, traitors, bought, by, the, romans, viriatus, has, long, been, hailed, as, the, first, truly, heroic, figure, in, proto, portuguese, history, nonetheless, he, was, responsible, for, raids, into, the, more, settled, romanized, parts, of, southern, portugal, and, lusitania, that, involved, the, victimization, of, the, inhabitants, the, conquest, of, the, iberian, peninsula, was, complete, two, centuries, after, the, roman, arrival, when, they, defeated, the, remaining, cantabri, astures, and, gallaeci, in, the, cantabrian, wars, in, the, time, of, emperor, augustus, 19, bc, in, 74, ad, vespasian, granted, latin, rights, to, most, municipalities, of, lusitania, in, 212, ad, the, constitutio, antoniniana, gave, roman, citizenship, to, all, free, subjects, of, the, empire, and, at, the, end, of, the, century, the, emperor, diocletian, founded, the, province, of, gallaecia, which, included, modern, day, northern, portugal, with, its, capital, at, bracara, augusta, now, braga, as, well, as, mining, the, romans, also, developed, agriculture, on, some, of, the, best, agricultural, land, in, the, empire, in, what, is, now, alentejo, vines, and, cereals, were, cultivated, and, fishing, was, intensively, pursued, in, the, coastal, belt, of, the, algarve, p, voa, de, varzim, matosinhos, troia, and, the, coast, of, lisbon, for, the, manufacture, of, garum, that, was, exported, by, roman, trade, routes, to, the, entire, empire, business, transactions, were, facilitated, by, coinage, and, the, construction, of, an, extensive, road, network, bridges, and, aqueducts, such, as, trajan, s, bridge, in, aquae, flaviae, now, chaves, roman, rule, brought, geographical, mobility, to, the, inhabitants, of, portugal, and, increased, their, interaction, with, the, rest, of, the, world, as, well, as, internally, soldiers, often, served, in, different, regions, and, eventually, settled, far, from, their, birthplace, while, the, development, of, mining, attracted, migration, into, the, mining, areas, the, romans, founded, numerous, cities, such, as, olisipo, lisbon, bracara, augusta, braga, aeminium, coimbra, and, pax, julia, beja, and, left, important, cultural, legacies, in, what, is, now, portugal, vulgar, latin, the, basis, of, the, portuguese, language, became, the, dominant, language, of, the, region, and, christianity, spread, throughout, lusitania, from, the, third, century, in, 409, with, the, decline, of, the, roman, empire, the, iberian, peninsula, was, occupied, by, germanic, tribes, that, the, romans, referred, to, as, barbarians, in, 411, with, a, federation, contract, with, emperor, honorius, many, of, these, people, settled, in, hispania, an, important, group, was, made, up, of, the, suebi, and, vandals, in, gallaecia, who, founded, the, kingdom, of, the, suebi, with, its, capital, in, braga, they, came, to, dominate, aeminium, coimbra, as, well, and, there, were, visigoths, to, the, south, the, suebi, and, the, visigoths, were, the, germanic, tribes, who, had, the, most, lasting, presence, in, the, territories, corresponding, to, modern, portugal, as, elsewhere, in, western, europe, there, was, a, decline, in, urban, life, during, the, dark, ages, roman, institutions, declined, in, the, wake, of, the, germanic, invasions, with, the, exception, of, ecclesiastical, organizations, which, were, fostered, by, the, suebi, in, the, fifth, century, and, adopted, by, the, visigoths, afterwards, although, the, suebi, and, visigoths, were, initially, followers, of, arianism, and, priscillianism, they, adopted, catholicism, from, the, local, inhabitants, st, martin, of, braga, was, a, particularly, influential, evangelist, at, this, time, the, kingdom, of, the, suebi, was, the, germanic, post, roman, kingdom, established, in, the, former, roman, provinces, of, gallaecia, lusitania, 5th, century, vestiges, of, alan, settlements, were, found, in, alenquer, from, old, germanic, alan, kerk, temple, of, the, alans, coimbra, and, lisbon, king, hermeric, made, a, peace, treaty, with, the, gallaecians, before, passing, his, domains, to, rechila, his, son, in, 429, the, visigoths, moved, south, to, expel, the, alans, and, vandals, and, founded, a, kingdom, with, its, capital, in, toledo, in, 448, rechila, died, leaving, the, state, in, expansion, to, rechiar, subsequently, this, new, king, started, to, print, coins, under, his, own, name, becoming, the, first, of, the, germanic, kings, to, do, so, and, then, was, baptised, to, nicene, christianity, probably, by, the, bishop, balconius, also, becoming, the, first, of, the, germanic, kings, to, do, so, even, before, clovis, king, of, the, franks, this, bellicose, king, almost, conquered, the, whole, of, hispania, taking, many, prisoners, and, several, important, cities, but, failed, to, consolidate, his, conquest, over, the, territory, and, didn, t, even, come, near, tarragona, after, the, assassination, of, the, patrician, flavius, a, tius, rechiar, attempted, yet, again, to, conquer, the, whole, of, the, peninsula, however, his, ambitions, were, derailed, by, the, invading, visigoths, under, their, king, and, roman, foederatus, theodoric, ii, acting, on, the, orders, of, the, emperor, avitus, this, led, to, a, resounding, defeat, of, the, suebian, kingdom, with, rechiar, fleeing, wounded, from, braga, only, to, be, captured, at, oporto, and, executed, in, december, of, 456, d, c, the, realm, was, then, divided, with, frantan, and, aguiulfo, ruling, simultaneously, both, reigned, from, 456, to, 457, the, year, in, which, maldras, 457, 459, reunified, the, kingdom, he, was, assassinated, after, a, failed, roman, visigothic, conspiracy, although, the, conspiracy, did, not, achieve, its, true, purposes, the, suebian, kingdom, was, again, divided, between, two, kings, frumar, frumario, 459, 463, and, remismund, remismundo, son, of, maldras, 459, 469, who, would, re, reunify, his, father, s, kingdom, in, 463, he, would, be, forced, to, adopt, arianism, in, 465, due, to, the, visigoth, influence, from, 470, conflict, between, the, suebi, and, visigoths, increased, by, 500, the, visigothic, kingdom, had, been, installed, in, iberia, it, was, based, in, toledo, and, advancing, westwards, they, became, a, threat, to, the, suebian, rule, after, the, death, of, remismund, in, 469, a, dark, period, set, in, where, virtually, all, written, texts, and, accounts, disappear, this, period, lasted, until, 550, the, only, thing, known, about, this, period, is, that, theodemund, teodemundo, most, likely, ruled, the, suebians, the, dark, period, ended, with, the, reign, of, karriarico, 550, 559, who, reinstalled, catholic, christianity, in, 550, he, was, succeeded, by, theodemar, 559, 570, during, whose, reign, the, 1st, council, of, braga, 561, was, held, after, the, death, of, theodemar, miro, 570, 583, was, his, successor, during, his, reign, the, 2nd, council, of, braga, 572, was, held, the, councils, represented, an, advance, in, the, organization, of, the, territory, paroeciam, suevorum, suebian, parish, and, the,

in, which, miro, intervened, later, in, 583, he, also, organized, an, unsuccessful, expedition, to, reconquer, seville, during, the, return, from, this, failed, campaign, miro, died, thereby, ending, the, prominence, of, the, suebi, in, hispanic, politics, and, in, two, years, the, kingdom, would, be, conquered, by, the, visigoths, in, the, suebian, kingdom, many, internal, struggles, continued, to, take, place, eborico, eurico, 583, 584, was, dethroned, by, andeca, audeca, 584, 585, who, failed, to, prevent, the, visigothic, invasion, led, by, liuvigild, the, visigothic, invasion, completed, in, 585, turned, the, once, rich, and, fertile, kingdom, of, the, suebi, into, the, sixth, province, of, the, visigothic, kingdom, leovigild, was, crowned, king, of, gallaecia, hispania, and, gallia, narbonensis, for, the, next, 300, years, and, by, the, year, 700, the, entire, iberian, peninsula, was, ruled, by, the, visigoths, with, the, visigoths, settled, in, the, newly, formed, kingdom, a, new, class, emerged, that, had, been, unknown, in, roman, times, a, nobility, which, played, a, large, social, and, political, role, during, the, middle, ages, it, was, under, the, visigoths, that, the, church, began, to, play, an, important, part, within, the, state, since, the, visigoths, did, not, learn, latin, from, the, local, people, they, had, to, rely, on, catholic, bishops, to, continue, the, roman, system, of, governance, the, laws, established, during, the, visigothic, monarchy, were, thus, made, by, councils, of, bishops, and, the, clergy, started, to, emerge, as, a, high, ranking, class, under, the, visigoths, gallaecia, was, a, well, defined, space, governed, by, a, doge, of, its, own, doges, at, this, time, were, related, to, the, monarchy, and, acted, as, princes, in, all, matters, both, governors, wamba, and, wittiza, vitiza, acted, as, doge, they, would, later, become, kings, in, toledo, these, two, became, known, as, the, vitizians, who,

opposing, this, invasion, thus, becoming, the, last, visigothic, king, of, iberia, from, the, various, germanic, groups, who, settled, in, western, iberia, the, suebi, left, the, strongest, lasting, cultural, legacy, in, what, is, today, portugal, galicia, and, western, fringes, of, asturias, according, to, dan, stanislawski, the, portuguese, way, of, living, in, regions, north, of, the, tagus, is, mostly, inherited, from, the, suebi, in, which, small, farms, prevail, distinct, from, the, large, properties, of, southern, portugal, bracara, augusta, the, modern, city, of, braga, and, former, capital, of, gallaecia, became, the, capital, of, the, suebi, apart, from, cultural, and, some, linguistic, traces, the, suebians, left, the, highest, germanic, genetic, contribution, of, the, iberian, peninsula, in, portugal, and, galicia, orosius, at, that, time, resident, in, hispania, shows, a, rather, pacific, initial, settlement, the, newcomers, working, their, lands, or, serving, as, bodyguards, of, the, locals, another, germanic, group, that, accompanied, the, suebi, and, settled, in, gallaecia, were, the, buri, they, settled, in, the, region, between, the, rivers, c, vado, and, homem, in, the, area, known, as, terras, de, bouro, lands, of, the, buri, during, the, caliphate, of, the, umayyad, caliph, al, walid, i, commander, tariq, ibn, ziyad, led, a, small, force, that, landed, at, gibraltar, on, 30, april, 711, ostensibly, to, intervene, in, a, visigothic, civil, war, after, a, decisive, victory, over, king, roderic, at, the, battle, of, guadalete, on, 19, july, 711, tariq, ibn, ziyad, joined, by, the, arab, governor, musa, ibn, nusayr, of, ifriqiya, brought, most, of, the, visigothic, kingdom, under, muslim, occupation, in, a, seven, year, campaign, the, visigothic, resistance, to, this, invasion, was, ineffective, though, sieges, were, required, to, sack, a, couple, of, cities, this, is, in, part, because, the, ruling, visigoth, population, is, estimated, at, a, mere, 1, to, 2, of, the, total, population, on, one, hand, this, isolation, is, said, to, have, been, a, reasonably, strong, and, effective, instrument, of, government, on, the, other, it, was, highly, centralised, to, the, extent, that, the, defeat, of, the, royal, army, left, the, entire, land, open, to, the, invaders, the, resulting, power, vacuum, which, may, have, indeed, caught, tariq, completely, by, surprise, would, have, aided, the, muslim, conquest, immensely, indeed, it, may, have, been, equally, welcome, to, the, hispano, roman, peasants, who, as, d, w, lomax, claims, were, disillusioned, by, the, prominent, legal, linguistic, and, social, divide, between, them, and, the, barbaric, and, decadent, visigoth, royalty, the, visigothic, territories, included, what, is, today, spain, portugal, andorra, gibraltar, and, the, southwestern, part, of, france, known, in, ancient, times, as, septimania, the, invading, moors, wanted, to, conquer, and, convert, all, of, europe, to, islam, so, they, crossed, the, pyrenees, to, use, visigothic, septimania, as, a, base, of, operations, muslims, called, their, conquests, in, iberia, al, andalus, and, in, what, was, to, become, portugal, they, mainly, consisted, of, the, old, roman, province, of, lusitania, the, central, and, southern, regions, of, the, country, while, gallaecia, the, northern, regions, remained, unsubdued, until, the, berber, revolt, in, the, 730s, al, andalus, was, treated, as, a, dependency, of, umayyad, north, africa, subsequently, links, were, strained, until, the, caliphate, was, overthrown, in, the, late, 740s, the, medieval, muslim, moors, who, conquered, and, destroyed, the, christian, visigothic, kingdom, in, the, iberian, peninsula, were, a, mix, of, berbers, from, north, africa, and, arabs, from, the, middle, east, by, 714, vora, santar, m, and, coimbra, had, been, conquered, and, two, years, later, lisbon, was, in, muslim, control, by, 718, most, of, today, s, portuguese, territory, was, under, umayyad, rule, the, umayyads, eventually, stopped, in, poitiers, but, muslim, rule, in, iberia, would, last, until, 1492, with, the, fall, of, the, kingdom, of, granada, for, the, next, several, centuries, much, of, the, iberian, peninsula, remained, under, umayyad, rule, much, of, the, populace, was, allowed, to, remain, christian, and, many, of, the, lesser, feudal, rulers, worked, out, deals, where, they, would, submit, to, umayyad, rule, in, order, to, remain, in, power, they, would, pay, a, jizya, tax, kill, or, turn, over, rebels, and, in, return, receive, support, from, the, central, government, but, some, regions, including, lisbon, gharb, al, andalus, and, the, rest, of, what, would, become, portugal, rebelled, succeeded, in, freeing, themselves, by, the, early, 10th, century, in, 718, ad, a, visigothic, noble, named, pelagius, was, elected, leader, by, the, ousted, visigoth, nobles, pelagius, called, for, the, remnant, of, the, christian, visigothic, armies, to, rebel, against, the, moors, and, re, group, in, the, unconquered, northern, asturian, highlands, better, known, today, as, the, cantabrian, mountains, a, mountain, region, in, modern, northwestern, spain, adjacent, to, the, bay, of, biscay, he, planned, to, use, the, cantabrian, mountain, range, as, a, place, of, refuge, and, protection, from, the, invaders, and, as, a, springboard, to, reconquer, lands, from, the, moors, after, defeating, the, moors, in, the, battle, of, covadonga, in, 722, ad, pelagius, was, proclaimed, king, to, found, the, christian, kingdom, of, asturias, and, start, the, war, of, reconquest, known, in, portuguese, and, spanish, as, the, reconquista, currently, historians, and, archaeologists, generally, agree, that, northern, portugal, between, the, minho, and, the, douro, rivers, kept, a, significant, share, of, its, population, a, social, and, political, christian, area, that, until, the, late, 9th, century, had, no, acting, state, powers, however, in, the, late, 9th, century, the, region, became, part, of, a, complex, of, powers, the, galician, asturian, leonese, and, portuguese, power, structures, the, coastal, regions, in, the, north, were, also, attacked, by, norman, and, viking, raiders, mainly, from, 844, the, last, great, invasion, through, the, minho, river, ended, with, the, defeat, of, olaf, ii, haraldsson, in, 1014, against, the, galician, nobility, who, also, stopped, further, advances, into, the, county, of, portugal, at, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, a, small,

portugal, became, a, leading, european, power, that, ranked, with, england, france, and, spain, in, terms, of, economic, political, and, cultural, influence, though, not, dominant, in, european, affairs, portugal, did, have, an, extensive, colonial, trading, empire, throughout, the, world, backed, by, a, powerful, thalassocracy, portugal, was, a, pioneer, in, and, major, beneficiary, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, leading, to, nearly, four, centuries, of, slavery, in, portugal, the, beginnings, of, the, portuguese, empire, can, be, traced, to, 25, july, 1415, when, the, portuguese, armada, set, sail, for, the, rich, islamic, trading, center, of, ceuta, in, north, africa, the, armada, was, accompanied, by, king, john, i, his, sons, prince, duarte, a, future, king, prince, pedro, and, prince, henry, the, navigator, and, the, legendary, portuguese, hero, nuno, lvares, pereira, on, 21, august, 1415, ceuta, was, conquered, by, portugal, and, the, long, lived, portuguese, empire, was, founded, the, conquest, of, ceuta, was, facilitated, by, a, major, civil, war, that, had, been, engaging, the, muslims, of, the, maghreb, north, africa, since, 1411, this, civil, war, prevented, a, re, capture, of, ceuta, from, the, portuguese, when, the, king, of, granada, muhammed, ix, the, left, handed, laid, siege, to, ceuta, and, attempted, to, coordinate, forces, in, morocco, and, attract, aid, and, assistance, for, the, effort, from, tunis, the, muslim, attempt, to, retake, ceuta, was, ultimately, unsuccessful, and, ceuta, remained, the, first, part, of, the, new, portuguese, empire, further, steps, were, taken, that, soon, expanded, the, portuguese, empire, much, further, in, 1418, two, of, prince, henry, the, navigator, s, captains, jo, o, gon, alves, zarco, and, trist, o, vaz, teixeira, were, driven, by, a, storm, to, an, island, that, they, called, porto, santo, holy, port, in, gratitude, for, their, rescue, from, the, shipwreck, in, 1419, jo, o, gon, alves, zarco, disembarked, on, the, island, of, madeira, uninhabited, madeira, was, colonized, by, the, portuguese, in, 1420, between, 1427, and, 1431, most, of, the, azores, were, discovered, and, these, uninhabited, islands, were, colonized, by, the, portuguese, in, 1445, portuguese, expeditions, may, have, attempted, to, colonize, the, canary, islands, as, early, as, 1336, but, the, crown, of, castile, objected, to, any, portuguese, claim, to, them, castile, began, its, own, conquest, of, the, canaries, in, 1402, castile, expelled, the, last, portuguese, from, the, canary, islands, in, 1459, and, they, eventually, became, part, of, the, spanish, empire, in, 1434, gil, eanes, passed, cape, bojador, south, of, morocco, the, trip, marked, the, beginning, of, the, portuguese, exploration, of, africa, before, this, event, very, little, was, known, in, europe, about, what, lay, beyond, the, cape, at, the, end, of, the, 13th, century, and, the, beginning, of, the, 14th, those, who, tried, to, venture, there, became, lost, which, gave, birth, to, legends, of, sea, monsters, some, setbacks, occurred, in, 1436, the, canaries, were, officially, recognized, as, castilian, by, the, pope, earlier, they, had, been, recognized, as, portuguese, in, 1438, the, portuguese, were, defeated, in, a, military, expedition, to, tangier, these, setbacks, did, not, deter, the, portuguese, from, pursuing, their, exploratory, efforts, in, 1448, on, the, small, island, of, arguim, off, the, coast, of, mauritania, an, important, castle, was, built, to, function, as, a, feitoria, or, trading, post, for, commerce, with, inland, africa, some, years, before, the, first, african, gold, was, brought, to, portugal, that, circumvented, the, arab, caravans, that, crossed, the, sahara, some, time, later, the, caravels, explored, the, gulf, of, guinea, which, led, to, the, discovery, of, several, uninhabited, islands, cape, verde, s, o, tom, pr, ncipe, and, annob, n, on, 13, november, 1460, prince, henry, the, navigator, died, he, had, been, the, leading, patron, of, maritime, exploration, by, portugal, and, immediately, following, his, death, exploration, lapsed, henry, s, patronage, had, shown, that, profits, could, be, made, from, the, trade, that, followed, the, discovery, of, new, lands, accordingly, when, exploration, commenced, again, private, merchants, led, the, way, in, attempting, to, stretch, trade, routes, further, down, the, african, coast, in, the, 1470s, portuguese, trading, ships, reached, the, gold, coast, in, 1471, the, portuguese, captured, tangier, after, years, of, attempts, eleven, years, later, the, fortress, of, s, o, jorge, da, mina, in, the, town, of, elmina, on, the, gold, coast, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, was, built, christopher, columbus, set, sail, aboard, the, fleet, of, ships, taking, materials, and, building, crews, to, elmina, in, december, 1481, in, 1483, diogo, c, o, reached, and, explored, the, congo, river, in, 1484, portugal, officially, rejected, columbus, idea, of, reaching, india, from, the, west, because, it, was, seen, as, unfeasible, some, historians, have, claimed, that, the, portuguese, had, already, performed, fairly, accurate, calculations, concerning, the, size, of, the, world, and, therefore, knew, that, sailing, west, to, reach, the, indies, would, require, a, far, longer, journey, than, navigating, to, the, east, however, this, continues, to, be, debated, thus, began, a, long, lasting, dispute, that, eventually, resulted, in, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, with, castile, in, 1494, the, treaty, divided, the, largely, undiscovered, new, world, equally, between, the, portuguese, and, the, castilians, along, a, north, south, meridian, line, 370, leagues, 1770, km, 1100, miles, west, of, the, cape, verde, islands, with, all, lands, to, the, east, belonging, to, portugal, and, all, lands, to, the, west, to, castile, with, the, expedition, beyond, the, cape, of, good, hope, by, bartolomeu, dias, in, 1487, the, richness, of, india, was, now, accessible, indeed, the, cape, takes, its, name, from, the, promise, of, rich, trade, with, the, east, between, 1498, and, 1501, pero, de, barcelos, and, jo, o, fernandes, lavrador, explored, north, america, at, the, same, time, pero, da, covilh, reached, ethiopia, by, land, vasco, da, gama,

of, what, later, became, the, portuguese, colony, of, brazil, the, real, goal, of, the, expedition, was, to, open, sea, trade, to, the, empires, of, the, east, trade, with, the, east, had, effectively, been, cut, off, since, the, conquest, of, constantinople, in, 1453, accordingly, cabral, turned, away, from, exploring, the, coast, of, the, new, land, of, brazil, and, sailed, southeast, back, across, the, atlantic, and, around, the, cape, of, good, hope, cabral, reached, sofala, on, the, east, coast, of, africa, in, july, 1500, in, 1505, a, portuguese, fort, was, established, here,

modern, times, after, the, 16th, century, portugal, gradually, saw, its, wealth, and, influence, decrease, portugal, was, officially, an, autonomous, state, but, in, actuality, the, country, was, in, a, personal, union, with, the, spanish, crown, from, 1580, to, 1640, the, council, of, portugal, remained, independent, inasmuch, as, it, was, one, of, the, key, administrative, units, of, the, castilian, monarchy, legally, on, equal, terms, with, the, council, of, the, indies, the, joining, of, the, two, crowns, deprived, portugal, of, a, separate, foreign, policy, and, the, enemies, of, spain, became, the, enemies, of, portugal, england, had, been, an, ally, of, portugal, since, the, treaty, of, windsor, in, 1386, but, war, between, spain, and, england, led, to, a, deterioration, of, the, relations, with, portugal, s, oldest, ally, and, the, loss, of, hormuz, in, 1622, from, 1595, to, 1663, the, dutch, portuguese, war, led, to, invasions, of, many, countries, in, asia, and, competition, for, commercial, interests, in, japan, africa, and, south, america, in, 1624, the, dutch, seized, salvador, the, capital, of, brazil, in, 1630, they, seized, pernambuco, in, northern, brazil, a, treaty, of, 1654, returned, pernambuco, to, portuguese, control, however, both, the, english, and, the, dutch, continued, to, aspire, to, dominate, both, the, atlantic, slave, trade, and, the, spice, trade, with, the, far, east, the, dutch, intrusion, into, brazil, was, long, lasting, and, troublesome, to, portugal, the, dutch, captured, the, entire, coast, except, that, of, bahia, and, much, of, the, interior, of, the, contemporary, northeastern, brazilian, states, of, bahia, sergipe, alagoas, pernambuco, para, ba, rio, grande, do, norte, and, cear, while, dutch, privateers, sacked, portuguese, ships, in, both, the, atlantic, and, indian, oceans, beginning, with, a, major, spanish, portuguese, military, operation, in, 1625, this, trend, was, reversed, and, it, laid, the, foundations, for, the, recovery, of, remaining, dutch, controlled, areas, the, other, smaller, less, developed, areas, were, recovered, in, stages, and, relieved, of, dutch, piracy, in, the, next, two, decades, by, local, resistance, and, portuguese, expeditions, after, the, dissolution, of, the, iberian, union, in, 1640, portugal, would, re, establish, its, authority, over, some, lost,

iv, tried, to, make, portugal, a, spanish, province, and, portuguese, nobles, lost, power, because, of, this, as, well, as, the, general, strain, on, the, finances, of, the, spanish, throne, as, a, result, of, the, thirty, years, war, the, duke, of, braganza, one, of, the, native, noblemen, and, a, descendant, of, king, manuel, i, was, proclaimed, king, of, portugal, as, john, iv, on, 1, december, 1640, and, a, war, of, independence, against, spain, was, launched, the, governors, of, ceuta, did, not, accept, the, new, king, rather, they, maintained, their, allegiance, to, philip, iv, and, spain, the, portuguese, restoration, war, ended, the, sixty, year, period, of, the, iberian, union, under, the, house, of, habsburg, this, was, the, beginning, of, the, house, of, braganza, which, reigned, in, portugal, until, 1910, king, john, iv, s, eldest, son, came, to, reign, as, afonso, vi, however, his, physical, and, mental, disabilities, left, him, overpowered, by, lu, s, de, vasconcelos, e, sousa, 3rd, count, of, castelo, melhor, in, a, palace, coup, organized, by, the, king, s, wife, maria, francisca, of, savoy, and, his, brother, pedro, duke, of, beja, king, afonso, vi,

king, pedro, ii, pedro, s, reign, saw, the, consolidation, of, national, independence, imperial, expansion, and, investment, in, domestic, production, pedro, ii, s, son, john, v, saw, a, reign, characterized, by, the, influx, of, gold, into, the, coffers, of, the, royal, treasury, supplied, largely, by, the, royal, fifth, a, tax, on, precious, metals, that, was, received, from, the, portuguese, colonies, of, brazil, and, maranh, o, disregarding, traditional, portuguese, institutions, of, governance, john, v, acted, as, an, absolute, monarch, nearly, depleting, the, country, s, tax, revenues, on, ambitious, architectural, works, most, notably, mafra, palace, and, on, commissions, and, additions, for, his, sizeable, art, and, literary, collections, owing, to, his, craving, for, international, diplomatic, recognition, john, also, spent, large, sums, on, the, embassies, he, sent, to, the, courts, of, europe, the, most, famous, being, those, he, sent, to, paris, in, 1715, and, rome, in, 1716, official, estimates, and, most, estimates, made, so, far, place, the, number, of, portuguese, migrants, to, colonial, brazil, during, the, gold, rush, of, the, 18th, century, at, 600, 000, this, represented, one, of, the, largest, movements, of, european, populations, to, their, colonies, in, the, americas, during, colonial, times, from, 1709, john, v, prohibited, emigration, since, portugal, had, lost, a, sizable, proportion, of, its, population, brazil, was, elevated, to, a, vice, kingdom, in, 1738, sebasti, o, de, melo, the, talented, son, of, a, lisbon, squire, began, a, diplomatic, career, as, the, portuguese, ambassador, in, london, and, later, in, vienna, the, queen, regent, of, portugal, maria, anna, of, austria, was, fond, of, de, melo, and, after, his, first, wife, died, she, arranged, the, widowed, de, melo, s, second, marriage, to, the, daughter, of, the, austrian, field, marshal, leopold, josef, count, von, daun, king, john, v, of, portugal, however, was, not, pleased, and, recalled, melo, to, portugal, in, 1749, john, v, died, the, following, year, and, his, son, joseph, i, of, portugal, was, crowned, in, contrast, to, his, father, joseph, i, was, fond, of, de, melo, and, with, the, maria, anna, s, approval, he, appointed, melo, as, minister, of, foreign, affairs, as, the, king, s, confidence, in, de, melo, increased, he, entrusted, him, with, more, control, of, the, state, by, 1755, sebasti, o, de, melo, was, made, prime, minister, impressed, by, british, economic, success, he, had, witnessed, while, ambassador, he, successfully, implemented, similar, economic, policies, in, portugal, he, abolished, slavery, in, portugal, and, in, the, portuguese, colonies, in, india, reorganized, the, army, and, the, navy, restructured, the, university, of, coimbra, and, ended, discrimination, against, different, christian, sects, in, portugal, but, sebasti, o, de, melo, s, greatest, reforms, were, economic, and, financial, with, the, creation, of, several, companies, and, guilds, to, regulate, every, commercial, activity, he, demarcated, the, region, for, production, of, port, to, ensure, the, wine, s, quality, and, this, was, the, first, attempt, to, control, wine, quality, and, production, in, europe, he, ruled, with, a, strong, hand, by, imposing, strict, law, on, all, classes, of, portuguese, society, from, the, high, nobility, to, the, poorest, working, class, along, with, a, widespread, review, of, the, country, s, tax, system, these, reforms, gained, him, enemies, in, the, upper, classes, especially, among, the, high, nobility, who, despised, him, as, a, social, upstart, disaster, fell, upon, portugal, in, the, morning, of, 1, november, 1755, when, lisbon, was, struck, by, a, violent, earthquake, with, an, estimated, richter, scale, magnitude, of, 9, the, city, was, razed, to, the, ground, by, the, earthquake, and, the, subsequent, tsunami, and, fires, de, melo, survived, by, a, stroke, of, luck, and, immediately, embarked, on, rebuilding, the, city, with, his, famous, quote, what, now, we, bury, the, dead, and, feed, the, living, despite, the, natural, disaster, lisbon, s, population, suffered, no, epidemics, and, within, less, than, one, year, the, city, was, being, rebuilt, the, new, lisbon, downtown, was, designed, to, resist, subsequent, earthquakes, architectural, models, were, built, for, tests, and, the, effects, of, an, earthquake, were, simulated, by, marching, troops, around, the, models, the, buildings, and, big, squares, of, the, pombaline, downtown, of, lisbon, still, remain, as, one, of, lisbon, s, tourist, attractions, they, represent, the, world, s, first, earthquake, resistant, structures, sebasti, o, de, melo, also, made, an, important, contribution, to, the, study, of, seismology, by, designing, an, inquiry, that, was, sent, to, every, parish, in, the, country, following, the, earthquake, joseph, i, gave, his, prime, minister, even, more, power, and, sebasti, o, de, melo, became, a, powerful, progressive, dictator, as, his, power, grew, his, enemies, increased, in, number, and, bitter, disputes, with, the, high, nobility, became, frequent, in, 1758, joseph, i, was, wounded, in, an, attempted, assassination, the, t, vora, family, and, the, duke, of, aveiro, were, implicated, and, executed, after, a, quick, trial, the, jesuits, were, expelled, from, the, country, and, their, assets, confiscated, by, the, crown, sebasti, o, de, melo, showed, no, mercy, and, prosecuted, every, person, involved, even, women, and, children, this, was, the, final, stroke, that, broke, the, power, of, the, aristocracy, and, ensured, the, victory, of, the, minister, against, his, enemies, based, upon, his, swift, resolve, joseph, i, made, his, loyal, minister, count, of, oeiras, in, 1759, following, the, t, vora, affair, the, new, count, of, oeiras, knew, no, opposition, made, marquis, of, pombal, in, 1770, he, effectively, ruled, portugal, until, joseph, i, s, death, in, 1779, however, historians, also, argue, that, pombal, s, enlightenment, and, economic, progress, while, far, reaching, was, primarily, a, mechanism, for, enhancing, autocracy, at, the, expense, of, individual, liberty, and, an, apparatus, for, crushing, opposition, suppressing, criticism, furthering, colonial, exploitation, intensifying, book, censorship, and, consolidating, personal, control, and, profit, the, new, ruler, queen, maria, i, of, portugal, disliked, the, marquis, see, t, vora, affair, and, forbade, him, from, coming, within, 20, miles, of, her, thus, curtailing, his, influence, in, 1707, as, part, of, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, a, joint, portuguese, dutch, and, british, army, led, by, the, marquis, of, minas, ant, nio, lu, s, de, sousa, conquered, madrid, and, acclaimed, the, archduke, charles, of, austria, as, king, charles, iii, of, spain, along, the, route, to, madrid, the, army, led, by, the, marquis, of, minas, was, successful, in, conquering, ciudad, rodrigo, and, salamanca, later, in, the, following, year, madrid, was, reconquered, by, spanish, troops, loyal, to, the, bourbons, in, 1762, france, and, spain, tried, to, urge, portugal, to, join, the, bourbon, family, compact, by, claiming, that, great, britain, had, become, too, powerful, due, to, its, successes, in, the, seven, years, war, joseph, refused, to, accept, and, maintained, that, his, 1704, alliance, with, britain, was, no, threat, in, spring, 1762, spanish, and, french, troops, invaded, portugal, from, the, north, as, far, as, the, douro, while, a, second, column, sponsored, the, siege, of, almeida, captured, the, city, and, threatened, to, advance, on, lisbon, the, arrival, of, a, force, of, british, troops, helped, the, portuguese, army, commanded, by, the, count, of, lippe, by, blocking, the, franco, spanish, advance, and, driving, them, back, across, the, border, following, the, battle, of, valencia, de, alc, ntara, at, the, treaty, of, paris, in, 1763, spain, agreed, to, hand, almeida, back, to, portugal, with, the, invasions, by, napoleon, portugal, began, a, decline, that, lasted, until, the, 20th, century, it, was, hastened, by, the, independence, of, brazil, in, 1822, the, country, s, largest, colonial, possession, in, 1807, portugal, refused, napoleon, bonaparte, s, demand, to, accede, to, the, continental, system, of, embargo, against, the, united, kingdom, a, french, invasion, under, general, junot, followed, and, lisbon, was, captured, on, 8, december, 1807, british, intervention, in, the, peninsular, war, helped, in, maintaining, portuguese, independence, during, the, war, jo, o, vi, of, portugal, the, prince, regent, transferred, his, court, including, maria, i, to, the, portuguese, territory, of, brazil, and, established, rio, de, janeiro, as, the, capital, of, the, portuguese, empire, this, episode, is, known, as, the, transfer, of, the, portuguese, court, to, brazil, the, last, french, troops, were, expelled, in, 1812, the, war, cost, portugal, the, town, of, oliven, a, now, governed, by, spain, in, 1815, brazil, was, declared, a, kingdom, and, the, kingdom, of, portugal, was, united, with, it, forming, a, pluricontinental, state, the, united, kingdom, of, portugal, brazil, and, the, algarves, as, a, result, of, the, change, in, its, status, and, arrival, of, the, portuguese, royal, family, brazilian, administrative, civic, economical, military, educational, and, scientific, apparatus, were, expanded, and, highly, modernized, by, 1815, the, situation, in, europe, had, cooled, down, sufficiently, that, jo, o, vi, would, have, been, able, to, return, safely, to, lisbon, however, the, king, of, portugal, remained, in, brazil, until, the, liberal, revolution, of, 1820, which, started, in, porto, demanded, his, return, to, lisbon, in, 1821, thus, he, returned, to, portugal, but, left, his, son, pedro, in, charge, of, brazil, when, the, portuguese, government, attempted, the, following, year, to, return, the, kingdom, of, brazil, to, subordinate, status, his, son, pedro, with, the, overwhelming, support, of, the, brazilian, elites, declared, brazil, s, independence, from, portugal, cisplatina, today, s, sovereign, state, of, uruguay, in, the, south, was, one, of, the, last, additions, to, the, territory, of, brazil, under, portuguese, rule, brazilian, independence, was, recognized, in, 1825, whereby, emperor, pedro, i, granted, to, his, father, the, titular, honour, of, emperor, of, brazil, john, vi, s, death, in, 1826, caused, serious, questions, in, his, succession, though, pedro, was, his, heir, and, reigned, briefly, as, pedro, iv, his, status, as, a, brazilian, monarch, was, seen, as, an, impediment, to, holding, the, portuguese, throne, by, both, nations, pedro, abdicated, in, favour, of, his, daughter, maria, ii, however, pedro, s, brother, infante, miguel, claimed, the, throne, in, protest, after, a, proposal, for, miguel, and, maria, to, marry, failed, miguel, seized, power, as, king, miguel, i, in, 1828, in, order, to, defend, his, daughter, s, rights, to, the, throne, pedro, launched, the, liberal, wars, to, reinstall, his, daughter, and, establish, a, constitutional, monarchy, in, portugal, the, war, ended, in, 1834, with, miguel, s, defeat, the, promulgation, of, a, constitution, and,

when, during, the, cholera, outbreak, of, 1853, 1856, he, visited, hospitals, handing, out, gifts, and, comforting, the, sick, pedro, s, reign, was, short, as, he, died, of, cholera, in, 1861, after,

were, among, the, oldest, portuguese, founded, port, cities, in, its, african, territories, during, this, phase, portuguese, colonialism, focused, on, expanding, its, outposts, in, africa, into, nation, sized, territories, to, compete, with, other, european, powers, there, with, the, conference, of, berlin, of, 1884, portuguese, territories, in, africa, had, their, borders, formally, established, on, request, of, portugal, in, order, to, protect, the, centuries, long, portuguese, interests, in, the, continent, from, rivalries, enticed, by, the, scramble, for, africa, portuguese, towns, and, cities, in, africa, like, nova, lisboa, s, da, bandeira, silva, porto, malanje, tete, vila, junqueiro, vila, pery, and, vila, cabral, were, founded, or, redeveloped, inland, during, this, period, and, beyond, new, coastal, towns, like, beira, mo, medes, lobito, jo, o, belo, nacala, and, porto, am, lia, were, also, founded, even, before, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, railway,

mozambique, and, angola, most, of, present, day, zimbabwe, and, zambia, the, area, had, been, claimed, by, portugal, which, included, it, in, its, pink, map, but, this, clashed, with, british, aspirations, to, create, a, cape, to, cairo, railway, thereby, linking, its, colonies, from, the, north, of, africa, to, the, far, south, this, diplomatic, clash, led, to, several, waves, of, protest, and, prompted, the, downfall, of, the, portuguese, government, the, 1890, british, ultimatum, was, considered, by, portuguese, historians, and, politicians, at, that, time, to, be, the, most, outrageous, and, infamous, action, of, the, british, against, her, oldest, ally, it, is, considered, directly, responsible, for, the, 31, january, 1891, revolt, an, attempted, republican, coup, that,

baptista, de, ajud, on, the, coast, of, dahomey, was, also, under, portuguese, rule, in, addition, portugal, still, ruled, the, asian, territories, of, portuguese, india, portuguese, timor, and, portuguese, macau, on, 1, february, 1908, king, dom, carlos, i, of, portugal, and, his, heir, apparent, and, his, eldest, son, prince, royal, dom, lu, s, filipe, duke, of, braganza, were, assassinated, in, lisbon, in, the, terreiro, do, pa, o, by, two, portuguese, republican, activist, revolutionaries, alfredo, lu, s, da, costa, and, manuel, bu, a, under, his, rule, portugal, had, been, declared, bankrupt, twice, first, on, 14, june, 1892, and, then, again, on, 10, may, 1902, causing, social, turmoil, economic, disturbances, angry, protests, revolts, and, criticism, of, the, monarchy, his, second, and, youngest, son, manuel, ii, of, portugal, became, the, new, king, but, was, eventually, overthrown, by, the, 5, october, 1910, portuguese, republican, revolution, which, abolished, the, monarchy, and, installed, a, republican, government, in, portugal, causing, him, and, his, royal, family, to, flee, into, exile, in, london, england, the, first, republic, has, over, the, course, of, the, recent, past, been, neglected, by, many, historians, in, favor, of, the, estado, novo, as, a, result, it, is, difficult, to, attempt, a, global, synthesis, of, the, republican, period, in, view, of, the, important, gaps, that, still, persist, in, our, knowledge, of, its, political, history, as, far, as, the, 5, october, 1910, revolution, is, concerned, a, number, of, valuable, studies, have, been, made, first, among, which, ranks, vasco, pulido, valente, s, polemical, thesis, this, historian, posited, the, jacobin, and, urban, nature, of, the, revolution, carried, out, by, the, portuguese, republican, party, prp, and, claimed, that, the, prp, had, turned, the, republican, regime, into, a, de, facto, dictatorship, this, vision, clashes, with, an, older, interpretation, of, the, first, republic, as, a, progressive, and, increasingly, democratic, regime, that, presented, a, clear, contrast, to, ant, nio, de, oliveira, salazar, s, ensuing, dictatorship, the, first, republic, was, intensely, anti, clerical, it, was, secularist, and, followed, the, liberal, tradition, of, disestablishing, the, powerful, role, that, the, catholic, church, once, held, historian, stanley, payne, points, out, the, majority, of, republicans, took, the, position, that, catholicism, was, the, number, one, enemy, of, individualistic, middle, class, radicalism, and, must, be, completely, broken, as, a, source, of, influence, in, portugal, under, the, leadership, of, afonso, costa, the, justice, minister, the, revolution, immediately, targeted, the, catholic, church, churches, were, plundered, convents, were, attacked, and, clergy, were, harassed, scarcely, had, the, provisional, government, been, installed, when, it, began, devoting, its, entire, attention, to, an, anti, religious, policy, in, spite, of, the, disastrous, economic, situation, on, 10, october, five, days, after, the, inauguration, of, the, republic, the, new, government, decreed, that, all, convents, monasteries, and, religious, orders, were, to, be, suppressed, all, residents, of, religious, institutions, were, expelled, and, their, goods, confiscated, the, jesuits, were, forced, to, forfeit, their, portuguese, citizenship, a, series, of, anti, catholic, laws, and, decrees, followed, each, other, in, rapid, succession, on, 3, november, a, law, legalizing, divorce, was, passed, and, then, there, were, laws, to, recognize, the, legitimacy, of, children, born, outside, wedlock, authorize, cremation, secularize, cemeteries, suppress, religious, teaching, in, the, schools, and, prohibit, the, wearing, of, the, cassock, in, addition, the, ringing, of, church, bells, to, signal, times, of, worship, was, subjected, to, certain, restraints, and, the, public, celebration, of, religious, feasts, was, suppressed, the, government, also, interfered, in, the, running, of, seminaries, reserving, the, right, to, appoint, professors, and, determine, curricula, this, whole, series, of, laws, authored, by, afonso, costa, culminated, in, the, law, of, separation, of, church, and, state, which, was, passed, on, 20, april, 1911, a, republican, constitution, was, approved, in, 1911, inaugurating, a, parliamentary, regime, with, reduced, presidential, powers, and, two, chambers, of, parliament, the, republic, provoked, important, fractures, within, portuguese, society, notably, among, the, essentially, monarchist, rural, population, in, the, trade, unions, and, in, the, church, even, the, prp, had, to, endure, the, secession, of, its, more, moderate, elements, who, formed, conservative, republican, parties, like, the, evolutionist, party, and, the, republican, union, in, spite, of, these, splits, the, prp, led, by, afonso, costa, preserved, its, dominance, largely, due, to, a, brand, of, clientelist, politics, inherited, from, the, monarchy, in, view, of, these, tactics, a, number, of, opposition, forces, were, forced, to, resort, to, violence, in, order, to, enjoy, the, fruits, of, power, there, are, few, recent, studies, of, this, period, of, the, republic, s, existence, known, as, the, old, republic, nevertheless, an, essay, by, vasco, pulido, valente, should, be, consulted, 1997a, as, should, the, attempt, to, establish, the, political, social, and, economic, context, made, by, m, villaverde, cabral, 1988, the, prp, viewed, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, as, a, unique, opportunity, to, achieve, a, number, of, goals, putting, an, end, to, the, twin, threats, of, a, spanish, invasion, of, portugal, and, of, foreign, occupation, of, the, african, colonies, and, at, the, internal, level, creating, a, national, consensus, around, the, regime, and, even, around, the, party, these, domestic, objectives, were, not, met, since, participation, in, the, conflict, was, not, the, subject, of, a, national, consensus, and, since, it, did, not, therefore, serve, to, mobilise, the, population, quite, the, opposite, occurred, existing, lines, of, political, and, ideological, fracture, were, deepened, by, portugal, s, intervention, in, the, first, world, war, the, lack, of, consensus, around, portugal, s, intervention, in, turn, made, possible, the, appearance, of, two, dictatorships, led, by, general, pimenta, de, castro, january, may, 1915, and, sid, nio, pais, december, 1917, december, 1918, sidonismo, also, known, as, dezembrismo, decemberism, aroused, a, strong, interest, among, historians, largely, as, a, result, of, the, elements, of, modernity, that, it, contained, ant, nio, jos, telo, has, made, clear, the, way, in, which, this, regime, predated, some, of, the, political, solutions, invented, by, the, totalitarian, and, fascist, dictatorships, of, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, sid, nio, pais, undertook, the, rescue, of, traditional, values, notably, the, p, tria, homeland, and, attempted, to, rule, in, a, charismatic, fashion, a, move, was, made, to, abolish, traditional, political, parties, and, to, alter, the, existing, mode, of, national, representation, in, parliament, which, it, was, claimed, exacerbated, divisions, within, the, p, tria, through, the, creation, of, a, corporative, senate, the, founding, of, a, single, party, the, national, republican, party, and, the, attribution, of, a, mobilising, function, to, the, leader, the, state, carved, out, an, economically, interventionist, role, for, itself, while, at, the, same, time, repressing, working, class, movements, and, leftist, republicans, sid, nio, pais, also, attempted, to, restore, public, order, and, to, overcome, some, of, the, rifts, of, the, recent, past, making, the, republic, more, acceptable, to, monarchists, and, catholics, the, vacuum, of, power, created, by, sid, nio, pais, s, murder, on, 14, december, 1918, led, the, country, to, a, brief, civil, war, the, monarchy, s, restoration, was, proclaimed, in, the, north, of, portugal, known, as, the, monarchy, of, the, north, on, 19, january, 1919, and, four, days, later, a, monarchist, insurrection, broke, out, in, lisbon, a, republican, coalition, government, led, by, jos, relvas, coordinated, the, struggle, against, the, monarchists, by, loyal, army, units, and, armed, civilians, after, a, series, of, clashes, the, monarchists, were, definitively, chased, from, oporto, on, 13, february, 1919, this, military, victory, allowed, the, prp, to, return, to, government, and, to, emerge, triumphant, from, the, elections, held, later, that, year, having, won, the, usual, absolute, majority, it, was, during, this, restoration, of, the, old, republic, that, an, attempted, reform, was, carried, out, in, order, to, provide, the, regime, with, greater, stability, in, august, 1919, a, conservative, president, was, elected, ant, nio, jos, de, almeida, whose, evolutionist, party, had, come, together, in, wartime, with, the, prp, to, form, a, flawed, because, incomplete, sacred, union, and, his, office, was, given, the, power, to, dissolve, parliament, relations, with, the, holy, see, restored, by, sid, nio, pais, were, preserved, the, president, used, his, new, power, to, resolve, a, crisis, of, government, in, may, 1921, naming, a, liberal, government, the, liberal, party, being, the, result, of, the, postwar, fusion, of, evolutionists, and, unionists, to, prepare, the, forthcoming, elections, these, were, held, on, 10, july, 1921, with, victory, going, as, was, usually, the, case, to, the, party, in, power, however, liberal, government, did, not, last, long, on, 19, october, a, military, pronunciamento, was, carried, out, during, which, and, apparently, against, the, wishes, of, the, coup, s, leaders, a, number, of, prominent, conservative, figures, including, prime, minister, ant, nio, granjo, were, assassinated, this, event, known, as, the, night, of, blood, left, a, deep, wound, among, political, elites, and, public, opinion, there, could, be, no, greater, demonstration, of, the, essential, fragility, of, the, republic, s, institutions, and, proof, that, the, regime, was, democratic, in, name, only, since, it, did, not, even, admit, the, possibility, of, the, rotation, in, power, characteristic, of, the, elitist, regimes, of, the, nineteenth, century, a, new, round, of, elections, on, 29, january, 1922, inaugurated, a, fresh, period, of, stability, the, prp, once, again, emerged, from, the, contest, with, an, absolute, majority, discontent, with, this, situation, had, not, however, disappeared, numerous, accusations, of, corruption, and, the, manifest, failure, to, resolve, pressing, social, concerns, wore, down, the, more, visible, prp, leaders, while, making, the, opposition, s, attacks, more, deadly, at, the, same, time, moreover, all, political, parties, suffered, from, growing, internal, factionalism, especially, the, prp, itself, the, party, system, was, fractured, and, discredited, this, is, clearly, shown, by, the, fact, that, regular, prp, victories, at, the, ballot, box, did, not, lead, to, stable, government, between, 1910, and, 1926, there, were, forty, five, governments, the, opposition, of, presidents, to, single, party, governments, internal, dissent, within, the, prp, the, party, s, almost, non, existent, internal, discipline, and, its, desire, to, group, together, and, lead, all, republican, forces, made, any, government, s, task, practically, impossible, many, different, formulas, were, attempted, including, single, party, governments, coalitions, and, presidential, executives, but, none, succeeded, force, was, clearly, the, sole, means, open, to, the, opposition, if, the, prp, wanted, to, enjoy, the, fruits, of, power, historians, have, emphasized, the, failure, and, collapse, of, the, republican, dream, by, the, 1920s, sardica, summarizes, the, consensus, of, historians, sardica, however, also, points, out, the, permanent, impact, of, the, republican, experiment, by, the, mid, 1920s, the, domestic, and, international, scenes, began, to, favour, another, authoritarian, solution, wherein, a, strengthened, executive, might, restore, political, and, social, order, since, the, opposition, s, constitutional, route, to, power, was, blocked, by, the, various, means, deployed, by, the, prp, to, protect, itself, it, turned, to, the, army, for, support, the, political, awareness, of, the, armed, forces, had, grown, during, the, war, and, many, of, their, leaders, had, not, forgiven, the, prp, for, sending, them, to, a, war, they, did, not, want, to, fight, they, seemed, to, represent, to, conservative, forces, the, last, bastion, of, order, against, the, chaos, that, was, taking, over, the, country, links, were, established, between, conservative, figures, and, military, officers, who, added, their, own, political, and, corporative, demands, to, the, already, complex, equation, the, 28, may, 1926, coup, d, tat, enjoyed, the, support, of, most, army, units, and, even, of, most, political, parties, as, had, been, the, case, in, december, 1917, the, population, of, lisbon, did, not, rise, to, defend, the, republic, leaving, it, at, the, mercy, of, the, army, there, are, few, global, and, up, to, date, studies, of, this, turbulent, third, phase, of, the, republic, s, existence, nevertheless, much, has, been, written, about, the, crisis, and, fall, of, the, regime, and, the, 28, may, movement, the, first, republic, continues, to, be, the, subject, of, an, intense, debate, a, historiographical, balance, sheet, by, armando, malheiro, da, silva, 2000, identifies, three, main, interpretations, for, some, historians, the, first, republic, was, a, progressive, and, increasingly, democratic, regime, for, others, it, was, essentially, a, prolongation, of, the, liberal, and, elitist, regimes, of, the, 19th, century, a, third, group, chooses, to, highlight, the, regime, s, revolutionary, jacobin, and, dictatorial, nature, political, chaos, several, strikes, harsh, relations, with, the, church, and, considerable, economic, problems, aggravated, by, a, disastrous, military, intervention, in, the, first, world, war, led, to, the, military, 28, may, 1926, coup, d, tat, this, coup, installed, the, second, republic, which, started, as, the, ditadura, nacional, national, dictatorship, and, became, the, estado, novo, new, state, in, 1933, led, by, economist, ant, nio, de, oliveira, salazar, he, transformed, portugal, into, a, sort, of, fascist, regime, that, evolved, into, a, single, party, corporative, regime, portugal, although, neutral, informally, aided, the, nationalists, in, the, spanish, civil, war, 1936, 39, salazar, s, policy, after, the, war, was, to, provide, a, certain, level, of, liberalization, in, politics, in, terms, of, organized, opposition, with, more, freedom, of, the, press, opposition, parties, were, tolerated, to, an, extent, but, they, were, also, controlled, limited, and, manipulated, with, the, result, that, they, split, into, factions, and, never, formed, a, united, opposition, portugal, was, officially, neutral, in, world, war, ii, but, in, practice, salazar, collaborated, with, the, british, and, sold, them, rubber, and, tungsten, in, late, 1943, he, allowed, the, allies, to, establish, air, bases, in, the, azores, to, fight, german, u, boats, moreover, salazar, helped, spain, avoid, german, control, however, as, tungsten, was, a, major, product, of, portugal, it, was, also, sold, to, germany, until, june, 1944, when, the, threat, of, a, german, attack, on, portugal, was, minimal, salazar, worked, to, regain, control, of, east, timor, after, the, japanese, had, seized, it, also, he, admitted, several, thousand, jewish, refugees, during, the, war, lisbon, maintaining, air, connections, with, britain, and, the, u, s, became, a, hotbed, of, spies, of, several, war, parties, and, served, as, the, base, for, the, international, red, cross, in, its, distribution, of, relief, supplies, to,

defeat, and, the, loss, of, the, colonies, in, india, independence, movements, also, became, active, in, portuguese, angola, portuguese, mozambique, and, portuguese, guinea, the, portuguese, colonial, war, started, some, 122, 000, africans, died, in, the, conflict, portugal, during, this, period, was, never, an, outcast, and, was, a, founding, member, of, the, north, atlantic, treaty, organization, nato, the, organisation, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, oecd, and, the, european, free, trade, association, efta, after, the, death, of, salazar, in, 1970, his, replacement, by, marcelo, caetano, offered, a, certain, hope, that, the, regime, would, open, up, the, primavera, marcelista, marcelist, spring, however, the, colonial, wars, in, africa, continued, political, prisoners, remained, incarcerated, freedom, of, association, was, not, restored, censorship, was, only, slightly, eased, and, the, elections, remained, tightly, controlled, the, regime, retained, its, characteristic, traits, censorship, corporateness, with, a, market, economy, dominated, by, a, handful, of, economical, groups, continuous, surveillance, and, intimidation, of, several, sectors, of, society, through, the, use, of, a, political, police, and, techniques, instilling, fear, such, as, arbitrary, imprisonment, systematic, political, persecution, and, even, assassination, of, anti, regime, insurgents, the, carnation, revolution, of, april, 25, 1974, an, effectively, bloodless, left, wing, military, coup, installed, the, third, republic, and, implemented, broad, democratic, reforms, the, processo, revolucion, rio, em, curso, ongoing, revolutionary, process, was, the, tumultuous, period, during, the, portuguese, transition, to, democracy, it, started, after, a, failed, right, wing, coup, d, tat, on, march, 11, 1975, and, ended, after, a, failed, left, wing, coup, d, tat, on, november, 25, 1975, this, period, was, marked, by, political, turmoil, violence, and, instability, and, the, nationalization, of, industries, portugal, was, polarized, between, the, conservative, north, with, its, many, independent, small, farmers, and, the, radical, south, where, communists, helped, peasants, seize, control, of, large, estates, finally, in, the, 1976, legislative, election, the, socialist, party, came, in, first, in, elections, and, its, leader, m, rio, soares, formed, portugal, s, first, democratically, elected, government, in, nearly, a, half, century, the, social, democratic, party, and, its, center, right, allies, under, prime, minister, an, bal, cavaco, silva, gained, control, of, parliament, in, 1987, and, 1991, while, the, socialist, party, and, its, allies, succeeded, in, the, 1991, presidential, election, to, retain, the, presidency, for,

the, portuguese, military, and, citizens, from, angola, and, mozambique, would, prompt, an, era, of, chaos, and, severe, destruction, in, those, territories, after, independence, from, portugal, in, 1975, from, may, 1974, to, the, end, of, the, 1970s, over, a, million, portuguese, citizens, from, portugal, s, african, territories, mostly, from, portuguese, angola, and, mozambique, left, those, territories, as, destitute, refugees, the, retornados, the, newly, independent, countries, were, ravaged, by, brutal, civil, wars, in, the, following, decades, the, angolan, civil, war, 1975, 2002, and, mozambican, civil, war, 1977, 1992, responsible, for, millions, of, deaths, and, refugees, the, asian, dependency, of, macau, after, an, agreement, in, 1986, was, returned, to, chinese, sovereignty, in, 1999, portugal, applied, international, pressure, to, secure, east, timor, s, independence, from, indonesia, as, east, timor, was, still, legally, a, portuguese, dependency, and, recognized, as, such, by, the, united, nations, after, a, referendum, in, 1999, east, timor, voted, for, independence, which, portugal, recognized, in, 2002, with, the, 1975, 1976, independence, of, its, colonies, apart, from, macau, the, 560, year, old, portuguese, empire, effectively, ended, simultaneously, 15, years, of, war, effort, also, came, to, an, end, many, portuguese, returned, from, the, colonies, the, retornados, and, came, to, comprise, a, sizeable, proportion, of, the, population, approximately, 580, 000, of, portugal, s, 9, 8, million, citizens, in, 1981, this, opened, new, paths, for, the, country, s, future, just, as, others, closed, in, 1986, portugal, entered, the, european, economic, community, and, left, the, european, free, trade, association, which, had, been, founded, by, portugal, and, its, partners, in, 1960, the, country, joined, the, euro, in, 1999, the, portuguese, empire, ended, de, facto, in, 1999, when, macau, was, returned, to, china, and, de, jure, in, 2002, when, east, timor, became, independent, economic, development, was, one, of, the, major, objectives, of, the, carnation, revolution, and, it, was, widely, perceived, that, the, new, democracy, would, have, the, same, unfortunate, fate, of, the, previous, democratic, regimes, in, portugal, constitutional, monarchy, and, first, republic, if, like, them, it, failed, to, provide, economic, development, and, decent, standards, of, living, to, its, citizens, relative, to, western, europe, portugal, remained, stagnant, and, thus, poor, and, underdeveloped, for, most, of, the, estado, novo, regime, particularly, in, the, first, 30, years, but, the, modernization, of, the, economy, and, development, of, the, country, still, started, in, the, last, years, of, the, regime, with, a, period, of, strong, growth, from, 1961, to, 1973, however, the, gap, between, portugal, and, most, of, western, europe, was, still, abysmal, by, the, mid, 1970s, overall, the, third, republic, gave, continuity, to, the, growth, started, in, the, 1960s, and, was, marked, by, a, major, socio, economic, development, particularly, until, the, early, 2000s, gdp, per, capita, rose, from, 50, of, ec, 12, average, in, 1970, to, 70, in, 2000, which, nonetheless, represented, an, approach, to, the, western, european, standards, of, living, without, precedents, in, the, previous, centuries, concurrent, with, the, economic, development, the, third, republic, also, witnessed, major, improvements, in, health, education, infrastructure, housing, and, welfare, however, as, of, 2019, portugal, still, has, not, converged, with, the, most, advanced, economies, of, central, and, northern, europe, as, the, economy, has, been, stagnant, since, the, early, 2000s, the, portuguese, economy, declined, in, the, centuries, following, the, end, of, the, age, of, discoveries, and, neither, the, constitutional, monarchy, 1834, 1910, nor, the, first, republic, 1910, 1926, were, able, to, put, the, country, in, the, path, to, industrialization, and, development, while, ant, nio, de, oliveira, salazar, managed, to, discipline, the, portuguese, public, finances, in, the, 1930s, the, first, three, decades, of, the, estado, novo, regime, were, also, marked, by, a, relative, stagnation, and, underdevelopment, while, western, world, enjoyed, strong, economic, growth, portugal, remained, behind, as, such, by, 1960, the, portuguese, gdp, per, capita, was, only, 38, of, the, ec, 12, average, and, portugal, was, one, of, the, most, backward, countries, in, europe, however, things, started, to, change, in, the, late, estado, novo, starting, in, the, early, 1960s, portugal, entered, in, a, period, of, robust, economic, growth, and, structural, modernization, owing, to, a, liberalization, of, the, economy, and, the, rise, of, a, new, elite, which, was, developmental, technocratic, and, politically, liberal, as, an, expression, of, such, economic, opening, in, 1960, portugal, was, one, of, the, efta, founding, member, states, such, remarkable, growth, period, allowed, the, portuguese, gdp, per, capita, to, reach, 56, of, the, ec, 12, average, by, 1973, in, the, early, 1970s, the, government, of, marcelo, caetano, paved, some, foundations, for, a, welfare, state, which, actually, was, only, built, after, the, april, 25, 1974, revolution, with, reforms, in, health, gon, alves, ferreira, reform, and, education, veiga, sim, o, reform, however, the, new, wealth, acquired, from, the, 1960, 73, growth, was, unevenly, distributed, and, the, 1960s, were, also,
