to, 1871, hated, the, prussian, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, who, had, repeatedly, outmaneuvered, him, beust, looked, to, france, for, avenging, austria, s, defeat, and, attempted, to, negotiate, with, emperor, napoleon, iii, of, france, and, italy, for, an, anti, prussian, alliance, but, no, terms, could, be, reached, the, decisive, victory, of, the, prusso, german, armies, in, the, franco, prussian, war, and, the, subsequent, founding, of, the, german, empire, ended, all, hope, of, re, establishing, austrian, influence, in, germany, and, beust, retired, after, being, forced, out, of, germany, and, italy, the, dual, monarchy, turned, to, the, balkans, which, were, in, tumult, as, nationalistic, movements, were, gaining, strength, and, demanding, independence, both, russia, and, austria, hungary, saw, an, opportunity, to, expand, in, this, region, russia, took, on, the, role, of, protector, of, slavs, and, orthodox, christians, austria, envisioned, a, multi, ethnic, religiously, diverse, empire, under, vienna, s, control, count, gyula, andr, ssy, a, hungarian, who, was, foreign, minister, 1871, 1879, made, the, centerpiece, of, his, policy, one, of, opposition, to, russian, expansion, in, the, balkans, and, blocking, serbian, ambitions, to, dominate, a, new, south, slav, federation, he, wanted, germany, to, ally, with, austria, not, russia, russian, pan, slavic, organizations, sent, aid, to, the, balkan, rebels, and, so, pressured, the, tsar, s, government, to, declare, war, on, the, ottoman, empire, in, 1877, in, the, name, of, protecting, orthodox, christians, unable, to, mediate, between, the, ottoman, empire, and, russia, over, the, control, of, serbia, austria, hungary, declared, neutrality, when, the, conflict, between, the, two, powers, escalated, into, a, war, with, help, from, romania, and, greece, russia, defeated, the, ottomans, and, with, the, treaty, of, san, stefano, tried, to, create, a, large, pro, russian, bulgaria, this, treaty, sparked, an, international, uproar, that, almost, resulted, in, a, general, european, war, austria, hungary, and, britain, feared, that, a, large, bulgaria, would, become, a, russian, satellite, that, would, enable, the, tsar, to, dominate, the, balkans, british, prime, minister, benjamin, disraeli, moved, warships, into, position, against, russia, to, halt, the, advance, of, russian, influence, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, so, close, to, britain, s, route, through, the, suez, canal, the, treaty, of, san, stefano, was, seen, in, austria, as, much, too, favourable, for, russia, and, its, orthodox, slavic, goals, the, congress, of, berlin, rolled, back, the, russian, victory, by, partitioning, the, large, bulgarian, state, that, russia, had, carved, out, of, ottoman, territory, and, denying, any, part, of, bulgaria, full, independence, from, the, ottomans, the, congress, of, berlin, in, 1878, let, austria, occupy, but, not, annex, the, province, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, a, predominantly, slavic, area, austria, occupied, bosnia, and, herzegovina, as, a, way, of, gaining, power, in, the, balkans, serbia, montenegro, and, romania, became, fully, independent, nonetheless, the, balkans, remained, a, site, of, political, unrest, with, teeming, ambition, for, independence, and, great, power, rivalries, at, the, congress, of, berlin, in, 1878, gyula, andr, ssy, minister, of, foreign, affairs, managed, to, force, russia, to, retreat, from, further, demands, in, the, balkans, as, a, result, greater, bulgaria, was, broken, up, and, serbian, independence, was, guaranteed, in, that, year, with, britain, s, support, austria, hungary, stationed, troops, in, bosnia, to, prevent, the, russians, from, expanding, into, nearby, serbia, in, another, measure, to, keep, the, russians, out, of, the, balkans, austria, hungary, formed, an, alliance, the, mediterranean, entente, with, britain, and, italy, in, 1887, and, concluded, mutual, defence, pacts, with, germany, in, 1879, and, romania, in, 1883, against, a, possible, russian, attack, following, the, congress, of, berlin, the, european, powers, attempted, to, guarantee, stability, through, a, complex, series, of, alliances, and, treaties, anxious, about, balkan, instability, and, russian, aggression, and, to, counter, french, interests, in, europe, austria, hungary, forged, a, defensive, alliance, with, germany, in, october, 1879, and, in, may, 1882, in, october, 1882, italy, joined, this, partnership, in, the, triple, alliance, largely, because, of, italy, s, imperial, rivalries, with, france, tensions, between, russia, and, austria, hungary, remained, high, so, bismarck, replaced, the, league, of, the, three, emperors, with, the, reinsurance, treaty, with, russia, to, keep, the, habsburgs, from, recklessly, starting, a, war, over, pan, slavism, the, sand, ak, ra, ka, novibazar, region, was, under, austro, hungarian, occupation, between, 1878, and, 1909, when, it, was, returned, to, the, ottoman, empire, before, being, ultimately, divided, between, kingdoms, of, montenegro, and, serbia, on, the, heels, of, the, great, balkan, crisis, austro, hungarian, forces, occupied, bosnia, and, herzegovina, in, august, 1878, and, the, monarchy, eventually, annexed, bosnia, and, herzegovina, in, october, 1908, as, a, common, holding, of, cisleithania, and, transleithania, under, the, control, of, the, imperial, royal, finance, ministry, rather, than, attaching, it, to, either, territorial, government, the, annexation, in, 1908, led, some, in, vienna, to, contemplate, combining, bosnia, and, herzegovina, with, croatia, to, form, a, third, slavic, component, of, the, monarchy, the, deaths, of, franz, joseph, s, brother, maximilian, 1867, and, his, only, son, rudolf, made, the, emperor, s, nephew, franz, ferdinand, heir, to, the, throne, the, archduke, was, rumoured, to, have, been, an, advocate, for, this, trialism, as, a, means, to, limit, the, power, of, the, hungarian, aristocracy, a, proclamation, issued, on, the, occasion, of, its, annexation, to, the, habsburg, monarchy, in, october, 1908, promised, these, lands, constitutional, institutions, which, should, secure, to, their, inhabitants, full, civil, rights, and, a, share, in, the, management, of, their, own, affairs, by, means, of, a, local, representative, assembly, in, performance, of, this, promise, a, constitution, was, promulgated, in, 1910, the, principal, players, in, the, bosnian, crisis, of, 1908, 09, were, the, foreign, ministers, of, austria, and, russia, alois, lexa, von, aehrenthal, and, alexander, izvolsky, both, were, motivated, by, political, ambition, the, first, would, emerge, successful, and, the, latter, would, be, broken, by, the, crisis, along, the, way, they, would, drag, europe, to, the, brink, of, war, in, 1909, they, would, also, divide, europe, into, the, two, armed, camps, that, would, go, to, war, in, july, 1914, aehrenthal, had, started, with, the, assumption, that, the, slavic, minorities, could, never, come, together, and, the, balkan, league, would, never, cause, any, damage, to, austria, he, turned, down, an, ottoman, proposal, for, an, alliance, that, would, include, austria, turkey, and, romania, however, his, policies, alienated, the, bulgarians, who, turned, instead, to, russia, and, serbia, although, austria, had, no, intention, to, embark, on, additional, expansion, to, the, south, aehrenthal, encouraged, speculation, to, that, effect, expecting, that, it, would, paralyze, the, balkan, states, instead, it, incited, them, to, feverish, activity, to, create, a, defensive, block, to, stop, austria, a, series, of, grave, miscalculations, at, the, highest, level, thus, significantly, strengthened, austria, s, enemies, in, 1914, slavic, militants, in, bosnia, rejected, austria, s, plan, to, fully, absorb, the, area, they, assassinated, the, austrian, heir, and, precipitated, world, war, i, the, 28, june, 1914, assassination, of, archduke, franz, ferdinand, in, the, bosnian, capital, sarajevo, excessively, intensified, the, existing, traditional, religion, based, ethnic, hostilities, in, bosnia, however, in, sarajevo, itself, austrian, authorities, encouraged, violence, against, the, serb, residents, which, resulted, in, the, anti, serb, riots, of, sarajevo, in, which, catholic, croats, and, bosnian, muslims, killed, two, and, damaged, numerous, serb, owned, buildings, writer, ivo, andri, referred, to, the, violence, as, the, sarajevo, frenzy, of, hate, violent, actions, against, ethnic, serbs, were, organized, not, only, in, sarajevo, but, also, in, many, other, larger, austro, hungarian, cities, in, modern, day, croatia, and, bosnia, and, herzegovina, austro, hungarian, authorities, in, bosnia, and, herzegovina, imprisoned, and, extradited, approximately, 5, 500, prominent, serbs, 700, to, 2, 200, of, whom, died, in, prison, four, hundred, sixty, serbs, were, sentenced, to, death, and, a, predominantly, muslim, special, militia, known, as, the, schutzkorps, was, established, and, carried, out, the, persecution, of, serbs, some, members, of, the, government, such, as, minister, of, foreign, affairs, count, leopold, berchtold, and, army, commander, count, franz, conrad, von, h, tzendorf, had, wanted, to, confront, the, resurgent, serbian, nation, for, some, years, in, a, preventive, war, but, the, emperor, and, hungarian, prime, minister, istv, n, tisza, were, opposed, the, foreign, ministry, of, austro, hungarian, empire, sent, ambassador, l, szl, sz, gy, ny, to, potsdam, where, he, inquired, about, the, standpoint, of, the, german, emperor, on, 5, july, and, received, a, supportive, response, his, majesty, authorized, me, to, report, to, that, in, this, case, too, we, could, count, on, germany, s, full, support, as, mentioned, he, first, had, to, consult, with, the, chancellor, but, he, did, not, have, the, slightest, doubt, that, herr, von, bethmann, hollweg, would, fully, agree, with, him, particularly, with, regard, to, action, on, our, part, against, serbia, in, his, opinion, though, there, was, no, need, to, wait, patiently, before, taking, action, the, leaders, of, austria, hungary, therefore, decided, to, confront, serbia, militarily, before, it, could, incite, a, revolt, using, the, assassination, as, an, excuse, they, presented, a, list, of, ten, demands, called, the, july, ultimatum, expecting, serbia, would, never, accept, when, serbia, accepted, nine, of, the, ten, demands, but, only, partially, accepted, the, remaining, one, austria, hungary, declared, war, franz, joseph, i, finally, followed, the, urgent, counsel, of, his, top, advisers, over, the, course, of, july, and, august, 1914, these, events, caused, the, start, of, world, war, i, as, russia, mobilized, in, support, of, serbia, setting, off, a, series, of, counter, mobilizations, in, support, of, his, german, ally, on, thursday, 6, august, 1914, emperor, franz, joseph, signed, the, declaration, of, war, on, russia, italy, initially, remained, neutral, despite, its, alliance, with, austria, hungary, in, 1915, it, switched, to, the, side, of, the, entente, powers, hoping, to, gain, territory, from, its, former, ally, the, austro, hungarian, empire, played, a, relatively, passive, diplomatic, role, in, the, war, as, it, was, increasingly, dominated, and, controlled, by, germany, the, only, goal, was, to, punish, serbia, and, try, to, stop, the, ethnic, breakup, of, the, empire, and, it, completely, failed, starting, in, late, 1916, the, new, emperor, karl, removed, the, pro, german, officials, and, opened, peace, overtures, to, the, allies, whereby, the, entire, war, could, be, ended, by, compromise, or, perhaps, austria, would, make, a, separate, peace, from, germany, the, main, effort, was, vetoed, by, italy, which, had, been, promised, large, slices, of, austria, for, joining, the, allies, in, 1915, austria, was, only, willing, to, turn, over, the, trentino, region, but, nothing, more, karl, was, seen, as, a, defeatist, which, weakened, his, standing, at, home, and, with, both, the, allies, and, germany, the, austro, hungarian, empire, conscripted, 7, 8, million, soldiers, during, wwi, general, von, h, tzendorf, was, the, chief, of, the, austro, hungarian, general, staff, franz, joseph, i, who, was, much, too, old, to, command, the, army, appointed, archduke, friedrich, von, sterreich, teschen, as, supreme, army, commander, armeeoberkommandant, but, asked, him, to, give, von, h, tzendorf, freedom, to, take, any, decisions, von, h, tzendorf, remained, in, effective, command, of, the, military, forces, until, emperor, karl, i, took, the, supreme, command, himself, in, late, 1916, and, dismissed, conrad, von, h, tzendorf, in, 1917, meanwhile, economic, conditions, on, the, homefront, deteriorated, rapidly, the, empire, depended, on, agriculture, and, agriculture, depended, on, the, heavy, labor, of, millions, of, men, who, were, now, in, the, army, food, production, fell, the, transportation, system, became, overcrowded, and, industrial, production, could, not, successfully, handle, the, overwhelming, need, for, munitions, germany, provided, a, great, deal, of, help, but, it, was, not, enough, furthermore, the, political, instability, of, the, multiple, ethnic, groups, of, empire, now, ripped, apart, any, hope, for, national, consensus, in, support, of, the, war, increasingly, there, was, a, demand, for, breaking, up, the, empire, and, setting, up, autonomous, national, states, based, on, historic, language, based, cultures, the, new, emperor, sought, peace, terms, from, the, allies, but, his, initiatives, were, vetoed, by, italy, the, heavily, rural, empire, did, have, a, small, industrial, base, but, its, major, contribution, was, manpower, and, food, nevertheless, austria, hungary, was, more, urbanized, 25, than, its, actual, opponents, in, the, first, world, war, like, the, russian, empire, 13, 4, serbia, 13, 2, or, romania, 18, 8, furthermore, the, austro, hungarian, empire, had, also, more, industrialized, economy, and, higher, gdp, per, capita, than, the, kingdom, of, italy, which, was, economically, the, far, most, developed, actual, opponent, of, the, empire, on, the, home, front, food, grew, scarcer, and, scarcer, as, did, heating, fuel, hungary, with, its, heavy, agricultural, base, was, somewhat, better, fed, the, army, conquered, productive, agricultural, areas, in, romania, and, elsewhere, but, refused, to, allow, food, shipments, to, civilians, back, home, morale, fell, every, year, and, the, diverse, nationalities, gave, up, on, the, empire, and, looked, for, ways, to, establish, their, own, nation, states, inflation, soared, from, an, index, of, 129, in, 1914, to, 1589, in, 1918, wiping, out, the, cash, savings, of, the, middle, class, in, terms, of, war, damage, to, the, economy, the, war, used, up, about, 20, percent, of, the, gdp, the, dead, soldiers, amounted, to, about, four, percent, of, the, 1914, labor, force, and, the, wounded, ones, to, another, six, percent, compared, all, the, major, countries, in, the, war, the, death, and, casualty, rate, was, toward, the, high, end, regarding, the, present, day, territory, of, austria, by,

advancing, serbian, army, to, impose, control, and, end, the, uprisings, at, the, start, of, the, war, the, army, was, divided, into, two, the, smaller, part, attacked, serbia, while, the, larger, part, fought, against, the, formidable, imperial, russian, army, the, invasion, of, serbia, in, 1914, was, a, disaster, by, the, end, of, the, year, the, austro, hungarian, army, had, taken, no, territory, but, had, lost, 227, 000, out, of, a, total, force, of, 450, 000, men, however, in, the, autumn, of, 1915, the, serbian, army, was, defeated, by, the, central, powers, which, led, to, the, occupation, of, serbia, near, the, end, of, 1915, in, a, massive, rescue, operation, involving, more, than, 1, 000, trips, made, by, italian, french, and, british, steamers, 260, 000, serb, surviving, soldiers, were, transported, to, brindisi, and, corfu, where, they, waited, for, the, chance, of, the, victory, of, allied, powers, to, reclaim, their, country, corfu, hosted, the, serbian, government, in, exile, after, the, collapse, of, serbia, and, served, as, a, supply, base, to, the, greek, front, in, april, 1916, a, large, number, of, serbian, troops, were, transported, in, british, and, french, naval, vessels, from, corfu, to, mainland, greece, the, contingent, numbering, over, 120, 000, relieved, a, much, smaller, army, at, the, macedonian, front, and, fought, alongside, british, and, french, troops, on, the, eastern, front, the, war, started, out, equally, poorly, the, government, accepted, the, polish, proposal, of, establishing, the, supreme, national,

hungary, mobilized, and, concentrated, new, divisions, and, the, successful, russian, advance, was, halted, and, slowly, repelled, but, the, austrian, armies, took, heavy, losses, about, 1, million, men, and, never, recovered, nevertheless, the, huge, losses, in, men, and, material, inflicted, on, the, russians, during, the, offensive, contributed, greatly, to, the, revolutions, of, 1917, and, it, caused, an, economic, crash, in, the, russian, empire, the, act, of, 5, november, 1916, was, proclaimed, then, to, the, poles, jointly, by, the, emperors, wilhelm, ii, of, germany, and, franz,

controlled, by, the, central, powers, with, the, nominal, authority, vested, in, the, regency, council, the, origin, of, that, document, was, the, dire, need, to, draft, new, recruits, from, german, occupied, poland, for, the, war, with, russia, following, the, armistice, of, 11, november, 1918, ending, the, world, war, i, in, spite, of, the, previous, initial, total, dependence, of, the,

territories, never, intended, by, the, central, powers, to, be, ceded, to, poland, the, battle, of, zborov, 1917, was, the, first, significant, action, of, the, czechoslovak, legions, who, fought,

under, his, command, the, italians, retook, the, initiative, and, won, the, decisive, battle, of, the, piave, river, 15, 23, june, 1918, in, which, some, 60, 000, austrian, and, 43, 000, italian, soldiers, were, killed, the, final, battle, at, vittorio, veneto, was, lost, by, 31, october, 1918, and, the, armistice, was, signed, at, villa, giusti, on, 3, november, on, 27, august, 1916, romania, declared, war, against, austria, hungary, the, romanian, army, crossed, the, borders, of, eastern, hungary, transylvania, and, despite, initial, successes, by, november, 1916, the, central, powers, formed, by, the, austro, hungarian, german, bulgarian, and, ottoman, armies, had, defeated, the, romanian, and, russian, armies, of, the, entente, powers, and, occupied, the, southern, part, of, romania, including, oltenia, muntenia, and, dobruja, within, three, months, of, the, war, the, central, powers, came, near, bucharest, the, romanian, capital, city, on, 6, december, the, central, powers, captured, bucharest, and, part, of, the, population, moved, to, the, unoccupied, romanian, territory, in, moldavia, together, with, the, romanian, government, royal, court, and, public, authorities, which, relocated, to, ia, i, in, 1917, after, several, defensive, victories, managing, to, stop, the, german, austro, hungarian, advance, with, russia, s, withdrawal, from, the, war, following, the, october, revolution, romania, was, forced, to, drop, out, of, the, war, although, the, kingdom, of, hungary, comprised, only, 42, of, the, population, of, austria, hungary, the, thin, majority, more, than, 3, 8, million, soldiers, of, the, austro, hungarian, armed, forces, were, conscripted, from, the, kingdom, of, hungary, during, the, first, world, war, roughly, 600, 000, soldiers, were, killed, in, action, and, 700, 000, soldiers, were, wounded, in, the, war, austria, hungary, held, on, for, years, as, the, hungarian, half, provided, sufficient, supplies, for, the, military, to, continue, to, wage, war, this, was, shown, in, a, transition, of, power, after, which, the, hungarian, prime, minister, count, istv, n, tisza, and, foreign, minister, count, istv, n, buri, n, had, decisive, influence, over, the, internal, and, external, affairs, of, the, monarchy, by, late, 1916, food, supply, from, hungary, became, intermittent, and, the, government, sought, an, armistice, with, the, entente, powers, however, this, failed, as, britain, and, france, no, longer, had, any, regard, for, the, integrity, of, the, monarchy, because, of, austro, hungarian, support, for, germany, the, setbacks, that, the, austrian, army, suffered, in, 1914, and, 1915, can, be, attributed, to, a, large, extent, by, the, incompetence, of, the, austrian, high, command, after, attacking, serbia, its, forces, soon, had, to, be, withdrawn, to, protect, its, eastern, frontier, against, russia, s, invasion, while, german, units, were, engaged, in, fighting, on, the, western, front, this, resulted, in, a, greater, than, expected, loss, of, men, in, the, invasion, of, serbia, furthermore, it, became, evident, that, the, austrian, high, command, had, had, no, plans, for, possible, continental, war, and, that, the, army, and, navy, were, also, ill, equipped, to, handle, such, a, conflict, in, the, last, two, years, of, the, war, the, austro, hungarian, armed, forces, lost, all, ability, to, act, independently, of, germany, as, of, 7, september, 1916, the, german, emperor, was, given, full, control, of, all, the, armed, forces, of, the, central, powers, and, austria, hungary, effectively, became, a, satellite, of, germany, the, austrians, viewed, the, german, army, favorably, on, the, other, hand, by, 1916, the, general, belief, in, germany, was, that, germany, in, its, alliance, with, austria, hungary, was, shackled, to, a, corpse, the, operational, capability, of, the, austro, hungarian, army, was, seriously, affected, by, supply, shortages, low, morale, and, a, high, casualty, rate, and, by, the, army, s, composition, of, multiple, ethnicities, with, different, languages, and, customs, by, 1918, the, economic, situation, had, deteriorated, and, governmental, failure, on, the, homefront, ended, popular, support, for, the, war, the, austro, hungarian, monarchy, collapsed, with, dramatic, speed, in, the, autumn, of, 1918, leftist, and, pacifist, political, movements, organized, strikes, in, factories, and, uprisings, in, the, army, had, become, commonplace, as, the, war, went, on, the, ethnic, unity, declined, the, allies, encouraged, breakaway, demands, from, minorities, and, the, empire, faced, disintegration, with, apparent, allied, victory, approaching, nationalist, movements, seized, ethnic, resentment, to, erode, social, unity, the, military, breakdown, of, the, italian, front, marked, the, start, of, the, rebellion, for, the, numerous, ethnicities, who, made, up, the, multiethnic, empire, as, they, refused, to, keep, on, fighting, for, a, cause, that, now, appeared, senseless, the, emperor, had, lost, much, of, his, power, to, rule, as, his, realm, disintegrated, on, 14, october, 1918, foreign, minister, baron, istv, n, buri, n, von, rajecz, asked, for, an, armistice, based, on, president, woodrow, wilson, s, fourteen, points, and, two, days, later, emperor, karl, i, issued, a, proclamation, imperial, manifesto, of, 16, october, 1918, altering, the, empire, into, a, federal, union, to, give, ethnic, groups, decentralization, and, representation, however, on, 18, october, united, states, secretary, of, state, robert, lansing, replied, that, autonomy, for, the, nationalities, the, tenth, of, the, fourteen, points, was, no, longer, enough, in, fact, a, czechoslovak, provisional, government, had,

of, czechoslovakia, and, followed, up, in, other, major, cities, in, the, next, few, days, on, 30, october, the, slovaks, did, the, same, on, 29, october, the, slavs, in, both, portions, of, what, remained, of, austria, hungary, proclaimed, the, state, of, slovenes, croats, and, serbs, and, declared, that, their, ultimate, intention, was, to, unite, with, serbia, and, montenegro, in, a, large, south, slav, state, on, the, same, day, the, czechs, and, slovaks, formally, proclaimed, the, establishment, of, czechoslovakia, as, an, independent, state, on, 17, october, 1918, the, hungarian,

there, was, nothing, left, of, the, habsburg, realm, but, its, majority, german, danubian, and, alpine, provinces, and, karl, s, authority, was, being, challenged, even, there, by, the, german, austrian, state, council, karl, s, last, austrian, prime, minister, heinrich, lammasch, concluded, that, karl, s, position, was, untenable, lammasch, persuaded, karl, that, the, best, course, was, to, relinquish, at, least, temporarily, his, right, to, exercise, sovereign, authority, on, 11, november, karl, issued, a, carefully, worded, proclamation, in, which, he, recognized, the, austrian, people, s, right, to, determine, the, form, of, the, state, and, relinquish, ed, every, participation, in, austrian, state, affairs, on, the, day, after, he, announced, his, withdrawal, from,

were, determined, by, the, austro, hungarian, compromise, of, 1867, in, which, common, expenditures, were, allocated, 70, to, austria, and, 30, to, hungary, this, division, had, to, be, renegotiated,

the, early, 1900s, in, a, prolonged, constitutional, crisis, it, was, triggered, by, disagreement, over, which, language, to, use, for, command, in, hungarian, army, units, and, deepened, by, the, advent, to, power, in, budapest, in, april, 1906, of, a, hungarian, nationalist, coalition, provisional, renewals, of, the, common, arrangements, occurred, in, october, 1907, and, in, november, 1917,

enacted, ethnic, and, minority, rights, the, next, such, laws, were, in, switzerland, but, these, were, overturned, after, the, russian, and, austrian, armies, crushed, the, hungarian, revolution, after, the, kingdom, of, hungary, reached, the, compromise, with, the, habsburg, dynasty, in, 1867, one, of, the, first, acts, of, its, restored, parliament, was, to, pass, a, law, on, nationalities, act, number, xliv, of, 1868, it, was, a, liberal, piece, of, legislation, and, offered, extensive, language, and, cultural, rights, it, did, not, recognize, non, hungarians, to, have, rights, to, form, states, with, any, territorial, autonomy, article, 19, of, the, 1867, basic, state, act, staatsgrundgesetz, valid, only, for, the, cisleithanian, austrian, part, of, austria, hungary, said, all, races, of, the, empire, have, equal, rights, and, every, race, has, an, inviolable, right, to, the, preservation, and, use, of, its, own, nationality, and, language, the, equality, of, all, customary, languages, landes, bliche, sprachen, in, school, office, and, public, life, is, recognized, by, the, state, in, those, territories, in, which, several, races, dwell, the, public, and, educational, institutions, are, to, be, so, arranged, that, without, applying, compulsion, to, learn, a, second, country, language, landessprache, each, of, the, races, receives, the, necessary, means, of, education, in, its, own, language, the, implementation, of, this, principle, led, to, several, disputes, as, it, was, not, clear, which, languages, could, be, regarded, as, customary, the, germans, the, traditional, bureaucratic, capitalist, and, cultural, elite, demanded, the, recognition, of, their, language, as, a, customary, language, in, every, part, of, the, empire, german, nationalists, especially, in, the, sudetenland, part, of, bohemia, looked, to, berlin, in, the, new, german, empire, the, hungarian, minority, act, of, 1868, gave, the, minorities, slovaks, romanians, serbs, et, al, individual, but, not, also, communal, rights, to, use, their, language, in, offices, schools, although, in, practice, often, only, in, those, founded, by, them, and, not, by, the, state, courts, and, municipalities, if, 20, of, the, deputies, demanded, it, beginning, with, the, 1879, primary, education, act, and, the, 1883, secondary, education, act, the, hungarian, state, made, more, efforts, to, reduce, the, use, of, non, magyar, languages, in, strong, violation, of, the, 1868, nationalities, law, after, 1875, all, slovak, language, schools, higher, than, elementary, were, closed, including, the, only, three, high, schools, gymnasiums, in, rev, ca, nagyr, ce, tur, iansky, sv, t, martin, tur, cszentm, rton, and, kl, tor, pod, znievom, zni, v, ralja, language, was, as, a, proxy, for, ethnicity, one, of, the, most, contentious, issues, in, austro, hungarian, politics, all, governments, faced, difficult, and, divisive, hurdles, in, deciding, on, the, languages, of, government, and, of, instruction, the, minorities, sought, the, widest, opportunities, for, education, in, their, own, languages, as, well, as, in, the, dominant, languages, hungarian, and, german, by, the, ordinance, of, 5, april, 1897, the, austrian, prime, minister, count, kasimir, felix, badeni, gave, czech, equal, standing, with, german, in, the, internal, government, of, bohemia, this, led, to, a, crisis, because, of, nationalist, german, agitation, throughout, the, empire, the, crown, dismissed, badeni, italian, was, regarded, as, an, old, culture, language, kultursprache, by, german, intellectuals, and, had, always, been, granted, equal, rights, as, an, official, language, of, the, empire, but, the, germans, had, difficulty, in, accepting, the, slavic, languages, as, equal, to, their, own, on, one, occasion, count, a, auersperg, anastasius, gr, n, entered, the, diet, of, carniola, carrying, what, he, claimed, to, be, the, whole, corpus, of, slovene, literature, under, his, arm, this, was, to, demonstrate, that, the, slovene, language, could, not, be, substituted, for, german, as, the, language, of, higher, education, the, following, years, saw, official, recognition, of, several, languages, at, least, in, austria, since, 1867, laws, awarded, croatian, equal, status, with, italian, in, dalmatia, beginning, in, 1882, there, was, a, slovene, majority, in, the, diet, of, carniola, and, in, the, capital, laibach, ljubljana, they, replaced, german, with, slovene, as, their, primary, official, language, galicia, designated, polish, instead, of, german, in, 1869, as, the, customary, language, of, government, as, of, june, 1907, all, public, and, private, schools, in, hungary, were, obliged, to, ensure, that, after, the, fourth, grade, the, pupils, could, express, themselves, fluently, in, hungarian, this, led, to, the, further, closing, of, minority, schools, devoted, mostly, to, the, slovak, and, rusyn, languages, the, two, kingdoms, sometimes, divided, their, spheres, of, influence, according, to, misha, glenny, in, his, book, the, balkans, 1804, 1999, the, austrians, responded, to, hungarian, support, of, czechs, by, supporting, the, croatian, national, movement, in, zagreb, in, recognition, that, he, reigned, in, a, multi, ethnic, country, emperor, franz, joseph, spoke, and, used, german, hungarian, and, czech, fluently, and, croatian, serbian, polish, and, italian, to, some, degree, the, language, disputes, were, most, fiercely, fought, in, bohemia, where, the, czech, speakers, formed, a, majority, and, sought, equal, status, for, their, language, to, german, the, czechs, had, lived, primarily, in, bohemia, since, the, 6th, century, and, german, immigrants, had, begun, settling, the, bohemian, periphery, in, the, 13th, century, the, constitution, of, 1627, made, the, german, language, a, second, official, language, and, equal, to, czech, german, speakers, lost, their, majority, in, the, bohemian, diet, in, 1880, and, became, a, minority, to, czech, speakers, in, the, cities, of, prague, and, pilsen, while, retaining, a, slight, numerical, majority, in, the, city, of, brno, br, nn, the, old, charles, university, in, prague, hitherto, dominated, by, german, speakers, was, divided, into, german, and, czech, speaking, faculties, in, 1882, at, the, same, time, hungarian, dominance, faced, challenges, from, the, local, majorities, of, romanians, in, transylvania, and, in, the, eastern, banat, slovaks, in, today, s, slovakia, and, croats, and, serbs, in, the, crown, lands, of, croatia, and, of,

union, with, their, fellow, nationalists, and, language, speakers, in, the, newly, founded, states, of, romania, 1859, 1878, and, serbia, hungary, s, leaders, were, generally, less, willing, than, their, austrian, counterparts, to, share, power, with, their, subject, minorities, but, they, granted, a, large, measure, of, autonomy, to, croatia, in, 1868, to, some, extent, they, modeled, their, relationship, to, that, kingdom, on, their, own, compromise, with, austria, of, the, previous, year, in, spite, of, nominal, autonomy, the, croatian, government, was, an, economic, and, administrative, part, of, hungary, which, the, croatians, resented, in, the, kingdom, of, croatia, slavonia, and, bosnia, and, herzegovina, many, advocated, the, idea, of, a, trialist, austro, hungaro, croatian, monarchy, among, the, supporters, of, the, idea, were, archduke, leopold, salvator, archduke, franz, ferdinand, and, emperor, and, king, charles, i, who, during, his, short, reign, supported, the, trialist, idea, only, to, be, vetoed, by, the, hungarian, government, and, count, istvan, tisza, the, count, finally, signed, the, trialist, proclamation, after, heavy, pressure, from, the, king, on, 23, october, 1918, in, istria, the, istro, romanians, a, small, ethnic, group, composed, by, around, 2, 600, people, in, the, 1880s, suffered, severe, discrimination, the, croats, of, the, region, who, formed, the, majority, tried, to, assimilate, them, while, the, italian, minority, supported, them, in, their, requests, for, self, determination, in, 1888, the, possibility, of, opening, the, first, school, for, the, istro, romanians, teaching, in, the, romanian, language, was, discussed, in, the, diet, of, istria, the, proposal, was, very, popular, among, them, the, italian,
