the, cretan, war, greek, romanized, kritik, s, p, lemos, turkish, girit, in, fethi, also, known, as, the, war, of, candia, italian, guerra, di, candia, or, the, fifth, ottoman, venetian, war, was, a, conflict, between, the, republic, of, venice, and, her, allies, chief, among, them, the, knights, of, malta, the, papal, states, and, france, against, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, barbary, states, because, it, was, largely, fought, over, the, island, of, crete, venice, s, largest, and, richest, overseas, possession, the, war, lasted, from, 1645, to, 1669, and, was, fought, in, crete, especially, in, the, city, of, candia, and, in, numerous, naval, engagements, and, raids, around, the, aegean, sea, with, dalmatia, providing, a, secondary, theater, of, operations, although, most, of, crete, was, conquered, by, the, ottomans, in, the, first, few, years, of, the, war, the, fortress, of, candia, modern, heraklion, the, capital, of, crete, resisted, successfully, its, prolonged, siege, troy, s, rival, as, lord, byron, called, it, forced, both, sides, to, focus, their, attention, on, the, supply, of, their, respective, forces, on, the, island, for, the, venetians, in, particular, their, only, hope, for, victory, over, the, larger, ottoman, army, in, crete, lay, in, successfully, starving, it, of, supplies, and, reinforcements, hence, the, war, turned, into, a, series, of, naval, encounters, between, the, two, navies, and, their, allies, venice, was, aided, by, various, western, european, nations, who, exhorted, by, the, pope, and, in, a, revival, of, crusading, spirit, sent, men, ships, and, supplies, to, defend, christendom, throughout, the, war, venice, maintained, overall, naval, superiority, winning, most, naval, engagements, but, the, efforts, to, blockade, the, dardanelles, were, only, partially, successful, and, the, republic, never, had, enough, ships, to, fully, cut, off, the, flow, of, supplies, and, reinforcements, to, crete, the, ottomans, were, hampered, in, their, efforts, by, domestic, turmoil, as, well, as, by, the, diversion, of, their, forces, north, towards, transylvania, and, the, habsburg, monarchy, the, prolonged, conflict, exhausted, the, economy, of, the, republic, which, relied, on, the, lucrative, trade, with, the, ottoman, empire, by, the, 1660s, despite, increased, aid, from, other, christian, nations, war, weariness, had, set, in, the, ottomans, on, the, other, hand, having, managed, to, sustain, their, forces, on, crete, and, reinvigorated, under, the, capable, leadership, of, the, k, pr, l, family, sent, a, final, great, expedition, in, 1666, under, the, direct, supervision, of, the, grand, vizier, this, began, the, final, and, bloodiest, stage, of, the, siege, of, candia, which, lasted, for, more, than, two, years, it, ended, with, the, negotiated, surrender, of, the, fortress, sealing, the, fate, of, the, island, and, ending, the, war, in, an, ottoman, victory, in, the, final, peace, treaty, venice, retained, a, few, isolated, island, fortresses, off, crete, and, made, some, territorial, gains, in, dalmatia, the, venetian, desire, for, a, revanche, would, lead, barely, 15, years, later, to, a, renewed, war, from, which, venice, would, emerge, victorious, crete, however, would, remain, under, ottoman, control, until, 1897, when, it, became, an, autonomous, state, it, was, finally, united, with, greece, in, 1913, after, the, loss, of, cyprus, to, the, ottomans, in, the, fourth, ottoman, venetian, war, 1570, 1573, the, island, of, crete, the, kingdom, of, candia, was, the, last, major, overseas, possession, of, venice, its, important, strategic, position, made, it, an, obvious, target, for, future, ottoman, expansion, while, its, size, and, fertile, ground, together, with, the, bad, state, of, its, fortresses, made, it, a, more, tempting, prize, than, malta, on, the, venetian, side, the, serenissima, with, its, weak, military, and, great, dependence, on, uninterrupted, trade, was, anxious, not, to, provoke, the, ottomans, hence, venice, scrupulously, observed, the, terms, of, its, treaty, with, the, ottomans, securing, over, sixty, years, of, peaceful, relations, by, the, early, 17th, century, moreover, venetian, power, had, declined, considerably, its, economy, which, had, once, prospered, because, of, its, control, over, the, eastern, spice, trade, had, suffered, as, a, result, of, the, opening, of, the, new, atlantic, trade, routes, and, from, the, loss, of, the, important, german, market, because, of, the, thirty, years, war, in, addition, the, republic, had, become, embroiled, in, a, series, of, wars, in, northern, italy, like, the, mantuan, war, and, was, further, weakened, by, an, outbreak, of, the, plague, in, 1629, 1631, the, potential, for, conflict, between, the, ottomans, and, venice, was, still, present, as, evidenced, in, 1638, when, a, venetian, fleet, attacked, and, destroyed, a, fleet, of, barbary, pirates, that, had, sought, protection, in, the, ottoman, port, of, valona, bombarding, the, city, in, the, process, sultan, murad, iv, was, enraged, he, threatened, to, execute, all, venetians, in, the, empire, and, put, an, embargo, on, venetian, trade, eventually, and, given, that, the, ottomans, were, still, engaged, in, a, war, with, the, persians, the, situation, was, defused, with, the, republic, paying, the, ottomans, an, indemnity, of, 250, 000, sequins, a, similar, episode, however, in, 1644, had, an, entirely, different, outcome, on, 28, september, the, knights, of, malta, attacked, an, ottoman, convoy, of, sailing, ships, on, its, way, from, constantinople, to, alexandria, aboard, which, were, a, number, of, pilgrims, bound, for, mecca, including, the, exiled, k, zlar, a, a, chief, black, eunuch, s, nb, l, a, a, the, kadi, of, cairo, and, the, nurse, of, the, future, sultan, mehmed, iv, during, the, fight, s, nb, l, a, a, and, most, of, the, important, pilgrims, were, slain, while, 350, men, and, 30, women, were, taken, to, be, sold, as, slaves, the, knights, loaded, their, loot, on, a, ship, which, then, docked, at, a, small, harbor, on, the, southern, coast, of, crete, for, a, few, days, where, it, disembarked, a, number, of, sailors, and, slaves, the, ottomans, were, enraged, at, the, incident, and, the, porte, accused, the, venetians, of, deliberate, collusion, with, the, knights, something, the, venetians, vehemently, denied, with, the, hawkish, party, being, then, dominant, in, the, ottoman, court, the, incident, was, seen, as, a, perfect, pretext, for, war, with, a, weakened, venice, despite, a, long, period, of, negotiations, which, lasted, until, well, into, 1645, and, against, the, objections, of, the, grand, vizier, sultanzade, mehmed, pasha, war, was, decided, upon, an, expedition, was, quickly, assembled, with, over, 50, 000, troops, and, reputedly, 416, vessels, under, kapudan, pasha, silahdar, yusuf, pasha, the, sultan, s, son, in, law, the, ottoman, armada, sailed, from, the, dardanelles, on, 30, april, heading, towards, the, harbor, of, navarino, in, the, peloponnese, where, it, remained, for, three, weeks, the, fleet, s, target, was, not, announced, but, the, ottomans, to, allay, venetian, fears, implied, that, it, would, be, malta, the, venetians, were, indeed, fooled, by, the, ottoman, subterfuge, and, were, taken, by, surprise, at, the, arrival, of, the, ottoman, fleet, at, crete, on, 23, june, 1645, despite, the, efforts, of, the, recently, appointed, provveditore, generale, andrea, corner, the, venetian, defenses, were, still, in, a, bad, state, the, island, s, fortifications, were, substantial, but, they, had, been, long, neglected, and, much, effort, was, put, into, repairing, them, anxious, about, ottoman, preparations, the, republic, reinforced, crete, in, late, 1644, with, 2, 500, troops, and, provisions, and, began, arming, its, fleet, while, assistance, was, promised, in, the, event, of, war, by, the, pope, and, tuscany, the, ottomans, first, landed, 15, miles, west, of, canea, chania, where, the, local, militia, fled, before, them, they, then, attacked, the, small, island, fortress, of, st, todero, the, commander, of, which, the, istrian, blasio, zulian, blew, himself, the, fortress, and, its, garrison, up, rather, than, let, it, fall, to, the, ottomans, the, ottoman, army, next, advanced, to, the, city, of, canea, itself, which, fell, on, 22, august, after, a, siege, that, lasted, for, 56, days, at, the, same, time, however, the, venetians, were, strengthened, as, the, promised, help, started, to, arrive, in, the, form, of, galleys, from, the, papal, states, tuscany, malta, and, naples, in, september, the, ottoman, fleet, was, in, disarray, but, the, allied, christian, fleet, under, the, cautious, command, of, niccol, ludovisi, the, pope, s, nephew, failed, to, exploit, the, opportunity, for, a, decisive, strike, when, the, christian, forces, finally, moved, to, retake, canea, on, 1, october, with, a, fleet, of, about, 90, ships, the, stout, ottoman, defense, and, the, allies, lack, of, cooperation, doomed, the, attack, soon, thereafter, the, venetian, allies, returned, to, their, bases, in, november, silahdar, yusuf, pasha, left, behind, a, strong, garrison, and, returned, to, constantinople, for, the, winter, there, however, he, fell, foul, of, the, sultan, and, was, executed, nevertheless, ottoman, preparations, continued, in, order, to, renew, and, expand, the, war, while, the, venetians, were, frantically, trying, to, raise, money, and, men, and, attempting, to, induce, other, european, powers, to, join, them, against, the, ottomans, however, as, most, of, europe, was, locked, into, the, fierce, antagonisms, of, the, thirty, years, war, their, pleas, fell, mostly, on, deaf, ears, the, venetians, were, hard, pressed, by, the, financial, demands, of, the, war, besides, placing, taxes, on, the, italian, mainland, possessions, the, terraferma, they, resorted, to, the, sale, of, nobility, titles, and, state, offices, to, fill, their, war, coffer, to, lead, the, effort, against, the, ottomans, the, senate, initially, appointed, the, 80, year, old, doge, francesco, erizzo, but, after, his, death, in, early, 1646, he, was, replaced, by, the, 73, year, old, giovanni, cappello, as, captain, general, of, the, sea, cappello, s, performance, in, 1646, was, distinctly, lackluster, he, failed, to, interdict, the, arrival, of, ottoman, reinforcements, under, koca, musa, pasha, in, june, see, below, and, an, attack, on, the, ottoman, fleet, at, chania, bay, in, august, failed, as, did, his, attempt, to, break, the, ottoman, blockade, of, rettimo, rethymno, as, a, result, the, city, fell, on, 20, october, while, the, citadel, held, out, until, 13, november, during, the, winter, of, 1646, 1647, both, sides, suffered, from, an, outbreak, of, plague, and, throughout, the, spring, of, 1647, operations, did, not, make, much, headway, in, mid, june, however, a, small, ottoman, force, routed, a, larger, body, of, venetian, mercenaries, this, ottoman, success, paved, the, way, for, gazi, h, seyin, pasha, the, local, commander, to, conquer, the, eastern, half, of, the, island, except, for, the, fortress, of, siteia, the, venetians, and, the, local, population, suffered, some, grievous, losses, it, is, estimated, that, by, 1648, almost, 40, of, the, cretan, population, had, perished, of, disease, or, warfare, and, in, 1677, the, island, s, pre, war, population, of, ca, 260, 000, had, dropped, to, about, 80, 000, by, the, beginning, of, 1648, all, of, crete, except, candia, and, a, few, strongholds, like, the, island, of, gramvousa, was, in, ottoman, hands, the, siege, began, in, may, 1648, the, ottomans, spent, three, months, investing, the, city, which, included, cutting, off, the, water, supply, eventually, it, would, last, until, 1669, the, second, longest, siege, in, history, after, the, siege, of, ceuta, 1694, 1727, by, the, moors, under, moulay, ismail, the, ottoman, besiegers, were, adversely, affected, by, the, bad, supply, situation, caused, by, the, activity, of, the, christian, fleets, in, the, aegean, who, intercepted, ottoman, convoys, carrying, supplies, and, reinforcements, to, the, island, in, addition, the, overall, ottoman, war, effort, was, severely, hampered, by, increased, domestic, instability, caused, by, sultan, ibrahim, s, erratic, policies, and, his, summary, execution, of, leading, state, officials, it, ultimately, led, to, his, deposition, in, favor, of, his, son, mehmed, iv, ushering, in, a, further, period, of, confusion, within, the, ottoman, government, the, lack, of, supplies, had, forced, the, ottoman, commander, gazi, h, seyin, pasha, to, lift, the, siege, in, early, 1649, but, it, was, renewed, for, a, short, period, of, two, months, after, the, arrival, of, the, ottoman, fleet, in, june, the, ottomans, assailed, the, fortifications, exploding, over, 70, mines, but, the, defenders, held, firm, the, ottomans, lost, over, 1, 000, men, and, the, subsequent, withdrawal, of, 1, 500, janissaries, and, the, lack, of, any, further, reinforcements, over, the, course, of, 1650, left, h, seyin, pasha, with, little, option, but, to, continue, maintaining, as, tight, a, blockade, as, possible, the, ottomans, strengthened, their, positions, with, the, construction, of, three, forts, in, the, canea, area, and, the, arrival, of, reinforcements, in, late, 1650, allowed, them, to, keep, up, their, tight, blockade, despite, the, venetian, blockade, of, the, dardanelles, and, the, political, turmoil, at, the, ottoman, court, the, ottoman, forces, were, kept, well, supplied, enough, to, sustain, themselves, although, too, weak, to, engage, in, offensive, actions, against, candia, itself, in, 1653, the, ottomans, took, the, island, fortress, of, selino, in, suda, bay, and, san, todero, captured, a, few, years, previously, was, refortified, the, venetian, naval, successes, over, the, next, few, years, further, reduced, the, offensive, ability, of, the, ottoman, army, in, crete, but, the, blockade, of, candia, continued, and, the, ottomans, retained, possession, of, their, other, conquests, on, the, island, until, the, arrival, of, a, new, ottoman, expeditionary, force, in, 1666, venice, could, not, directly, confront, the, large, ottoman, expeditionary, force, on, crete, but, it, did, possess, a, fine, navy, that, could, intervene, and, cut, the, ottoman, supply, routes, in, 1645, the, venetians, and, their, allies, possessed, a, fleet, of, 60, 70, galleys, 4, galleasses, and, about, 36, galleons, the, venetians, were, also, superior, in, their, use, of, a, mixed, fleet, of, both, galleys, and, sailing, ships, while, initially, the, ottoman, navy, relied, almost, exclusively, on, galleys, in, order, to, bolster, their, forces, both, opponents, hired, armed, merchantmen, from, the, netherlands, and, later, from, england, especially, the, ottomans, to, augment, their, forces, the, first, venetian, operation, was, an, attempt, to, blockade, the, dardanelles, in, 1646, to, interdict, the, supplies, headed, to, the, ottoman, forces, in, crete, a, force, of, 23, venetian, ships, under, tommaso, morosini, scoured, the, aegean, for, ottoman, shipping, and, attempted, to, capture, the, strategically, important, island, of, tenedos, at, the, entrance, of, the, dardanelles, the, kapudan, pasha, koca, musa, led, a, fleet, of, 80, warships, against, the, venetians, but, his, fleet, was, driven, back, into, the, dardanelles, on, 26, may, however, the, blockading, fleet, was, unable, to, stop, the, next, exit, of, the, ottoman, fleet, on, 4, june, when, the, lack, of, wind, enabled, the, ottoman, galleys, to, evade, the, venetian, sailing, ships, the, ottomans, were, thus, able, to, land, new, troops, and, supplies, on, crete, unopposed, the, efforts, of, the, venetian, fleet, to, counter, the, ottoman, land, operations, in, crete, likewise, failed, through, a, combination, of, timidity, on, behalf, of, their, commanders, the, delays, in, payment, for, the, crews, and, the, effects, of, a, widespread, plague, on, 27, january, 1647, the, venetians, lost, tommaso, morosini, when, his, ship, was, forced, to, face, the, entire, ottoman, fleet, of, 45, galleys, in, the, ensuing, fight, morosini, was, killed, but, managed, to, cause, significant, casualties, to, the, ottomans, including, koca, musa, pasha, himself, the, ship, itself, was, rescued, by, the, timely, arrival, of, the, venetian, fleet, under, the, new, captain, general, giovanni, battista, grimani, this, stand, off, where, a, single, ship, had, caused, such, damage, and, casualties, to, the, entire, ottoman, fleet, was, a, major, blow, to, ottoman, morale, despite, some, successes, like, a, raid, in, e, me, the, remainder, of, the, year, was, a, failure, for, the, venetians, as, several, attempts, to, blockade, ottoman, harbors, failed, to, stem, the, flow, of, supplies, and, reinforcements, to, crete, the, venetians, returned, to, the, dardanelles, in, 1648, despite, losing, many, ships, and, admiral, grimani, himself, in, a, storm, in, mid, march, reinforcements, under, giacomo, da, riva, brought, the, venetian, fleet, back, up, to, strength, some, 65, vessels, and, allowed, them, to, successfully, blockade, the, straits, for, a, whole, year, the, ottomans, countered, this, in, part, by, building, a, new, fleet, at, e, me, forcing, the, venetians, to, divide, their, forces, and, in, 1649, a, strengthened, ottoman, fleet, under, kapudan, pasha, voinok, ahmed, broke, the, blockade, despite, scoring, a, victory, over, the, ottoman, fleet, in, its, anchorage, at, phocaea, on, 12, may, 1649, capturing, or, destroying, several, ships, da, riva, was, not, able, to, prevent, the, ottoman, armada, from, eventually, reaching, crete, this, highlighted, the, weakness, of, the, venetian, position, maintaining, long, blockades, with, galleys, was, an, inherently, difficult, task, and, the, republic, did, not, have, enough, ships, to, control, both, the, dardanelles, and, the, passage, of, chios, at, the, same, time, in, addition, in, a, major, development, 1648, the, ottomans, decided, in, a, meeting, chaired, by, the, sultan, himself, to, build, and, employ, galleons, in, their, fleet, instead, of, relying, exclusively, on, oared, galleys, as, hitherto, for, most, of, 1650, a, venetian, fleet, of, 41, vessels, maintained, the, blockade, of, the, dardanelles, prohibiting, haideragazade, mehmed, pasha, from, sailing, for, crete, he, was, replaced, late, in, the, year, by, hozamzade, ali, pasha, governor, of, rhodes, who, used, a, clever, ploy, to, get, through, the, blockade, waiting, until, winter, when, the, venetians, withdrew, their, forces, he, assembled, a, small, number, of, ships, and, embarked, several, thousand, troops, with, many, provisions, on, them, and, sailed, unmolested, to, crete, on, 10, july, 1651, the, first, significant, naval, battle, of, the, war, was, fought, south, of, naxos, a, three, day, engagement, in, which, the, venetians, with, 58, ships, under, alvise, mocenigo, were, victorious, over, the, twice, as, large, ottoman, fleet, the, remainders, of, the, ottoman, fleet, withdrew, to, rhodes, from, where, they, were, however, able, to, reach, candia, mocenigo, was, replaced, soon, after, by, leonardo, foscolo, but, both, sides, did, not, accomplish, much, in, the, next, two, years, although, the, ottomans, did, succeed, in, supplying, their, forces, on, crete, while, keeping, their, fleet, intact, for, 1654, the, ottomans, marshaled, their, strength, the, arsenal, ters, ne, i, mire, in, the, golden, horn, produced, new, warships, and, squadrons, from, tripolitania, and, tunis, arrived, to, strengthen, the, ottoman, fleet, the, strengthened, ottoman, fleet, that, sailed, forth, from, the, dardanelles, in, early, may, numbered, 79, ships, 40, sailing, ships, 33, galleys, and, 6, galleasses, and, further, 22, galleys, from, around, the, aegean, and, 14, ships, from, barbary, stood, by, to, reinforce, it, off, the, straits, this, force, considerably, outnumbered, the, 26, ships, of, the, venetian, blockade, fleet, under, giuseppe, dolfin, although, the, battle, that, followed, resulted, in, an, ottoman, victory, for, the, venetians, given, the, successful, escape, of, their, fleet, from, the, superior, ottoman, force, coupled, with, reports, of, large, ottomans, casualties, and, the, great, bravery, displayed, by, the, venetian, crews, it, counted, as, a, moral, victory, the, ottoman, fleet, now, reinforced, by, the, aegean, and, barbary, squadrons, plundered, the, venetian, island, of, tinos, but, retreated, after, only, a, brief, skirmish, with, the, venetians, under, alvise, mocenigo, on, 21, june, kara, murad, pasha, succeeded, in, evading, the, venetians, for, the, remainder, of, the, year, with, both, fleets, sailing, back, and, forth, in, the, aegean, before, returning, to, the, dardanelles, in, september, due, to, agitation, among, the, fleet, s, janissaries, the, final, months, of, 1654, were, marked, by, a, significant, change, in, the, venetian, leadership, mocenigo, died, at, candia, and, was, succeeded, as, acting, captain, general, of, the, sea, by, francesco, morosini, who, had, distinguished, himself, in, the, previous, battles, morosini, initiated, a, more, energetic, approach, in, the, venetian, pursuit, of, the, war, in, the, spring, of, 1655, he, raided, the, ottoman, supply, depot, at, aigina, and, razed, the, port, town, of, volos, in, a, night, attack, on, 23, march, in, early, june, morosini, sailed, to, the, dardanelles, awaiting, the, sally, of, the, ottoman, fleet, which, was, however, delayed, because, of, political, upheaval, in, the, ottoman, government, leaving, lazzaro, mocenigo, with, half, the, fleet, 36, ships, to, keep, watch, at, the, straits, morosini, returned, to, the, cyclades, a, week, after, his, departure, however, on, 21, june, the, ottoman, fleet, numbering, 143, ships, under, mustapha, pasha, appeared, the, resulting, battle, was, a, clear, venetian, victory, the, ottoman, fleet, avoided, action, for, the, remainder, of, the, year, before, it, withdrew, to, winter, quarters, leaving, morosini, free, to, undertake, an, ultimately, unsuccessful, siege, of, the, strategically, important, island, fortress, of, malvasia, monemvasia, off, the, south, eastern, coast, of, the, peloponnese, in, september, morosini, was, posted, as, the, new, provveditore, of, crete, with, lorenzo, marcello, as, the, new, captain, general, of, the, sea, although, in, the, previous, years, the, venetians, had, generally, held, the, upper, hand, against, the, ottomans, largely, controlling, the, aegean, and, able, to, extract, tribute, and, recruits, from, its, islands, they, had, been, unable, to, transform, this, superiority, into, concrete, results, despite, their, defeats, the, ottomans, were, still, free, to, roam, the, aegean, and, resupply, their, forces, in, crete, in, particular, through, the, use, of, supply, fleets, from, places, like, alexandria, rhodes, chios, or, monemvasia, in, the, peloponnese, in, june, 1656, however, a, combined, venetian, maltese, fleet, of, 67, ships, under, marcello, inflicted, on, the, ottomans, with, 108, ships, under, kenan, pasha, their, worst, naval, defeat, since, lepanto, sixty, ottoman, ships, were, destroyed, and, 24, captured, and, 5, 000, christian, galley, slaves, set, free, although, the, venetians, and, maltese, suffered, some, casualties, too, including, the, loss, of, captain, general, marcello, although, in, the, aftermath, of, this, victory, the, maltese, contingent, departed, the, scale, of, their, success, enabled, the, venetians, under, barbado, doer, to, seize, tenedos, on, 8, july, and, lemnos, on, 20, august, using, the, two, islands, strategically, located, near, the, entrance, of, the, straits, as, forward, bases, the, venetian, blockade, became, much, more, effective, as, a, result, the, resupply, of, crete, was, effectively, cut, off, and, constantinople, itself, suffered, a, shortage, of, food, during, the, following, winter, in, 1657, the, ottomans, reversed, the, situation, a, new, and, energetic, grand, vizier, k, pr, l, mehmed, pasha, armed, with, almost, dictatorial, authority, had, been, appointed, in, september, 1656, and, reinvigorated, the, ottoman, war, effort, the, fleet, was, strengthened, under, the, new, kapudan, pasha, topal, mehmed, and, in, march, the, ottomans, succeeded, in, evading, the, venetian, blockade, of, the, straits, and, sailed, towards, tenedos, they, did, not, attack, the, island, however, because, the, venetian, garrison, was, too, strong, in, may, the, venetians, under, lazzaro, mocenigo, achieved, some, minor, victories, on, 3, may, and, two, weeks, later, at, suazich, reinforced, by, papal, and, maltese, ships, mocenigo, sailed, to, the, dardanelles, awaiting, the, renewed, sally, of, the, ottoman, fleet, which, came, on, 17, july, due, to, disagreements, among, the, christian, commanders, the, allied, battle, line, had, not, been, completely, formed, and, the, ottoman, fleet, was, able, to, exit, the, narrows, before, battle, was, joined, the, battle, consisted, of, a, series, of, actions, over, three, days, with, both, fleets, drifting, south, and, west, out, of, the, dardanelles, into, the, aegean, the, battle, ended, in, the, evening, of, 19, july, when, an, explosion, destroyed, the, venetian, flagship, and, killed, mocenigo, forcing, the, allied, fleet, to, withdraw, in, this, battle, the, venetians, had, inflicted, heavier, casualties, on, the, ottomans, than, they, had, suffered, but, the, ottomans, had, achieved, their, goal, the, blockade, was, broken, under, the, personal, direction, of, the, grand, vizier, and, strengthened, by, men, and, ships, from, the, barbary, states, the, ottoman, fleet, proceeded, to, recover, lemnos, on, 31, august, and, tenedos, on, 12, november, thus, removing, any, hope, the, venetians, may, have, had, of, re, establishing, the, blockade, as, firmly, as, before, in, 1658, ottoman, power, was, redirected, north, in, a, campaign, against, george, ii, r, k, czi, prince, of, transylvania, which, evolved, into, a, long, conflict, with, the, habsburgs, for, the, next, few, years, the, venetian, fleet, again, under, the, command, of, morosini, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, maintain, the, blockade, of, the, straits, of, the, dardanelles, morosini, also, resumed, his, tactic, of, attacking, ottoman, strongholds, a, siege, of, the, island, of, santa, maura, lefkada, in, august, 1658, failed, but, in, 1659, the, venetians, aided, by, the, maniots, sacked, kalamata, in, the, peloponnese, followed, by, torone, in, the, chalcidice, karystos, in, euboea, and, e, me, however, since, venice, could, not, spare, forces, to, occupy, these, places, these, raids, gained, the, republic, nothing, of, substance, on, the, ottoman, side, k, pr, l, mehmed, ordered, the, construction, of, two, new, forts, sedd, el, bahr, rampart, of, the, sea, and, kilid, bahr, key, of, the, sea, at, the, european, shore, of, the, entrance, of, the, dardanelles, to, prohibit, the, venetians, from, entering, the, straits, again, in, the, meantime, war, weariness, had, set, in, among, the, venetians, who, suffered, from, the, disruption, in, trade, peace, feelers, were, sent, to, the, ottomans, but, their, demand, for, the, full, concession, of, crete, as, a, condition, for, peace, was, unacceptable, to, the, republic, with, the, end, of, the, war, between, france, and, spain, however, the, venetians, became, encouraged, hoping, to, receive, increased, assistance, in, money, and, men, especially, from, the, french, whose, traditionally, good, relations, with, the, porte, had, soured, of, late, this, support, did, indeed, soon, develop, when, individuals, or, whole, companies, of, men, from, across, western, europe, volunteered, for, the, republic, s, army, while, christian, rulers, also, felt, obliged, to, provide, men, supplies, and, ships, the, first, french, contingent, of, 4, 200, men, under, prince, almerigo, d, este, arrived, in, april, 1660, along, with, further, contingents, of, german, mercenaries, troops, from, savoy, and, maltese, tuscan, and, french, ships, despite, this, increase, in, strength, morosini, s, operations, in, 1660, were, a, failure, an, assault, on, canea, in, august, succeeded, in, taking, the, outlying, fortifications, but, failed, to, retake, the, city, itself, similarly, an, attack, against, the, ottoman, siege, lines, at, candia, in, september, achieved, some, success, but, did, not, break, the, ottoman, siege, following, the, death, of, prince, d, este, at, naxos, shortly, after, the, french, contingent, returned, home, followed, soon, after, by, a, disheartened, morosini, who, was, succeeded, by, his, kinsman, giorgio, in, 1661, giorgio, morosini, scored, a, few, minor, successes, he, broke, an, ottoman, blockade, of, tinos, and, pursuing, the, ottoman, fleet, defeated, it, off, milos, the, next, few, years, however, were, relatively, idle, although, the, ottomans, were, heavily, engaged, with, the, austrians, in, hungary, and, that, their, fleet, rarely, sallied, forth, the, venetians, failed, to, make, use, of, this, opportunity, and, except, for, the, intercept, of, a, supply, convoy, from, alexandria, off, kos, in, 1662, there, was, little, action, if, the, venetians, were, idle, the, ottomans, were, not, with, the, signing, of, the, peace, of, vasv, r, in, 1664, they, were, able, to, focus, their, strength, against, crete, grand, vizier, k, pr, l, faz, l, ahmed, initiated, large, preparations, in, the, winter, of, 1665, 66, and, dispatched, 9, 000, men, to, bolster, the, ottoman, forces, in, crete, an, ottoman, peace, proposal, which, would, have, allowed, venice, to, keep, candia, against, an, annual, payment, of, tribute, was, rejected, and, in, may, 1666, the, ottoman, army, under, the, personal, leadership, of, the, grand, vizier, departed, from, thrace, for, southern, greece, whence, it, would, embark, for, crete, during, the, winter, in, february, 1667, the, venetians, received, significant, reinforcements, from, france, and, savoy, totaling, 21, warships, and, some, 6, 000, men, but, as, in, past, years, disagreements, among, the, leaders, of, the, various, contingents, over, precedence, france, the, papal, states, malta, naples, sicily, contributed, ships, and, men, hampered, operations, at, the, time, catherine, of, braganza, queen, of, england, involved, herself, in, the, effort, to, relieve, candia, but, failed, to, persuade, her, husband, charles, ii, to, take, any, action, francesco, morosini, now, again, captain, general, sought, to, engage, the, ottomans, but, they, avoided, battle, and, using, their, superior, resources, and, bases, they, steadily, kept, their, forces, on, crete, supplied, the, only, allied, success, in, 1667, was, the, repulsion, of, an, ottoman, raid, on, cerigo, kythera, on, 8, march, 1668, the, venetians, were, victorious, in, a, hard, fought, night, battle, off, the, island, of, st, pelagia, where, 2, 000, ottoman, troops, and, 12, galleys, attempted, to, seize, a, small, venetian, galley, squadron, forewarned, of, their, intentions, morosini, reinforced, it, and, won, a, costly, victory, which, was, to, be, venice, s, last, victory, at, sea, in, this, war, reinforced, again, with, papal, and, hospitaller, ships, the, venetians, maintained, a, blockade, of, canea, the, ottomans, main, supply, base, during, summer, to, secure, their, anchorage, off, st, todero, island, the, allied, forces, seized, the, fortress, island, of, st, marina, a, minor, success, which, did, not, in, the, end, prevent, the, kapudan, pasha, s, fleet, bearing, fresh, troops, and, supplies, from, reaching, canea, in, september, after, the, maltese, papal, squadron, had, departed, the, new, ottoman, army, arrived, on, the, island, during, the, winter, of, 1666, 1667, and, in, 22, may, the, final, phase, of, the, siege, overseen, by, the, grand, vizier, himself, began, it, lasted, 28, months, in, the, assaults, sorties, that, followed, 108, 000, turks, and, 29, 088, christians, lost, their, lives, these, casualties, included, 280, venetian, noblemen, a, figure, equivalent, to, roughly, a, quarter, of, the, grand, council, faced, with, the, renewed, ottoman, assault, and, a, struggling, economy, despite, the, prospect, of, considerable, reinforcements, from, western, europe, in, 1668, the, signoria, hoped, to, end, the, war, by, striking, a, peace, settlement, with, the, ottomans, indeed, the, venetians, hoped, to, use, the, imminent, arrival, of, reinforcements, to, secure, concessions, from, the, ottomans, admiral, andrea, valier, was, at, first, appointed, as, envoy, but, fell, ill, and, was, quickly, replaced, by, the, elderly, nobleman, alvise, da, molin, molin, and, his, embassy, traveled, to, larissa, where, the, ottoman, court, resided, during, one, of, the, sultan, s, hunting, expeditions, the, ottomans, proposed, that, venice, keep, one, half, of, crete, but, the, signoria, emboldened, by, further, pledges, of, reinforcements, especially, from, france, and, renewed, turmoil, at, the, ottoman, court, and, within, the, empire, refused, the, offer, molin, in, the, meantime, transported, by, the, ottomans, to, canea, in, crete, was, ordered, to, continue, negotiations, and, to, continue, observing, the, ottomans, strength, and, intentions, but, not, commit, himself, or, the, republic, on, 19, june, the, first, part, of, the, long, awaited, french, contingent, in, total, some, 6, 000, soldiers, and, 31, ships, under, the, command, of, fran, ois, duke, of, beaufort, arrived, at, candia, the, second, part, comprising, the, galley, fleet, would, arrive, on, 3, july, the, ottomans, had, been, making, steady, progress, over, the, past, years, having, reached, the, outer, bastions, of, the, fortress, the, defenders, were, in, dire, straits, while, most, of, the, city, of, candia, lay, ruined, the, french, staged, their, first, sally, on, 25, june, caught, by, surprise, the, ottomans, were, quickly, routed, but, the, french, became, disorganized, among, the, siege, trenches, and, an, ottoman, counter, attack, drove, them, back, the, attack, thus, ended, in, disaster, costing, the, french, some, 800, dead, including, the, duke, of, beaufort, himself, who, was, hit, by, a, bullet, and, left, on, the, field, the, arrival, of, the, second, half, of, the, french, expeditionary, force, revived, the, defenders, morale, and, a, combined, attack, was, agreed, upon, involving, bombardment, of, the, ottoman, siege, lines, by, the, powerful, allied, fleet, the, attack, was, launched, on, 25, july, in, an, impressive, display, of, firepower, up, to, 15, 000, cannonballs, were, said, to, have, been, fired, by, the, fleet, alone, the, ottomans, however, were, well, protected, by, their, deep, earthworks, and, suffered, comparatively, little, damage, while, things, went, awry, for, the, christian, fleet, as, an, accident, caused, the, explosion, of, the, french, flagship, th, r, se, which, in, turn, caused, significant, casualties, among, the, surrounding, french, and, venetian, ships, this, failure, coupled, with, the, disaster, of, the, previous, month, further, soured, the, relations, between, the, french, and, the, venetians, cooperation, was, distinctly, lacking, in, the, few, operations, attempted, during, the, next, few, weeks, while, the, bad, supply, situation, the, spread, of, sickness, among, their, troops, and, the, continuous, attrition, of, their, forces, in, the, everyday, fighting, at, candia, made, the, french, commanders, especially, keen, to, depart, the, french, contingent, eventually, departed, on, 20, august, two, ottoman, assaults, on, the, 25th, were, repulsed, but, to, morosini, it, was, clear, that, the, city, could, no, longer, be, held, after, a, council, of, war, on, 27, august, but, without, first, consulting, venice, it, was, decided, to, capitulate, on, 5, september, 1669, the, city, was, surrendered, to, the, ottomans, while, the, survivors, of, the, garrison, the, citizens, and, their, treasures, were, evacuated, on, his, own, initiative, morosini, concluded, a, permanent, peace, agreement, with, the, ottomans, which, under, the, circumstances, was, relatively, generous, venice, would, retain, the, aegean, islands, of, tinos, and, kythera, and, the, isolated, island, fortresses, of, spinalonga, gramvousa, and, souda, off, the, cretan, coast, as, well, as, the, gains, made, in, dalmatia, the, dalmatian, front, was, a, separate, theater, of, operations, which, was, involved, in, the, early, phase, of, the, war, the, conditions, there, were, almost, reverse, to, those, in, crete, for, the, ottomans, it, was, too, far, away, and, relatively, insignificant, while, the, venetians, operated, near, their, own, bases, of, supply, and, had, undisputed, control, of, the, sea, being, thus, able, to, easily, reinforce, their, coastal, strongholds, the, ottomans, launched, a, large, scale, attack, in, 1646, and, made, some, significant, gains, including, the, capture, of, the, islands, of, krk, pag, and, cres, and, most, importantly, the, supposedly, impregnable, fortress, of, novigrad, which, surrendered, on, 4, july, after, only, two, days, of, bombardment, the, ottomans, were, now, able, to, threaten, the, two, main, venetian, strongholds, in, dalmatia, zadar, and, split, in, the, next, year, however, the, tide, turned, as, the, venetian, commander, leonardo, foscolo, seized, several, forts, retook, novigrad, temporarily, captured, the, fortress, of, knin, and, took, klis, while, a, month, long, siege, of, the, fortress, of, ibenik, by, the, ottomans, in, august, and, september, failed, during, the, next, few, years, military, operations, stalled, because, of, an, outbreak, of, famine, and, plague, amongst, the, venetians, at, zadar, while, both, sides, focused, their, resources, in, the, aegean, area, as, other, fronts, took, priority, for, the, ottomans, no, further, operations, occurred, in, the, dalmatian, theater, peace, in, 1669, found, the, republic, of, venice, with, significant, gains, in, dalmatia, its, territory, tripled, and, its, control, of, the, adriatic, thus, secured, during, the, course, of, the, war, the, venetians, sought, to, instigate, greek, uprisings, in, several, regions, against, the, turks, such, uprisings, mainly, took, place, in, the, peloponnese, and, the, aegean, islands, where, the, presence, of, christian, navy, emboldened, the, greeks, to, rebel, against, ottoman, rule, in, 1647, when, the, venetian, general, giovanni, battista, grimani, had, blocked, a, large, part, of, the, ottoman, navy, in, argolis, there, was, an, uprising, in, nauplio, which, was, largely, unsuccessful, in, 1659, there, were, several, small, uprisings, in, laconia, messenia, and, argolis, during, the, spring, of, 1659, francesco, morosini, departed, for, sifnos, where, he, met, the, former, patriarch, of, constantinople, joannicius, ii, and, several, other, greek, clerics, subsequently, they, went, to, the, mani, peninsula, in, order, to, encourage, a, rebellion, in, march, 1959, although, initially, reluctant, the, maniots, invaded, and, conquered, kalamata, with, support, from, the, christian, allies, several, villages, in, northeastern, pelopponese, from, mani, to, elis, rebelled, around, the, same, time, however, when, the, ottomans, counter, attacked, morosini, left, the, peloponnese, with, several, greek, notables, and, went, to, milos, in, august, in, order, to, continue, the, uprisings, morosini, sent, two, greek, clerics, from, crete, to, the, peloponnese, promising, future, military, interventions, from, venice, which, never, happened, ultimately, the, ottomans, closed, in, on, the, rebels, forcing, them, to, either, surrender, or, flee, to, italy, especially, carg, se, corsica, in, modern, day, france, the, surrender, of, candia, ended, the, four, and, a, half, centuries, of, venetian, rule, in, crete, and, brought, the, ottoman, empire, to, its, temporary, territorial, zenith, at, the, same, time, the, cost, and, casualties, incurred, during, this, prolonged, war, contributed, greatly, to, the, decline, of, the, ottoman, state, during, the, latter, 17th, century, on, the, other, hand, venice, had, lost, its, greatest, and, most, prosperous, colony, its, pre, eminent, trading, position, in, the, mediterranean, had, diminished, and, its, treasury, was, exhausted, having, spent, some, 4, 253, 000, ducats, on, the, defense, of, candia, alone, to, all, this, the, dalmatian, gains, were, insufficient, compensation, upon, his, return, to, venice, in, 1670, morosini, was, tried, on, charges, of, insubordination, and, treason, but, was, acquitted, fifteen, years, later, he, would, lead, the, venetian, forces, in, the, morean, war, where, the, republic, attempted, for, the, last, time, to, reverse, its, losses, and, reestablish, itself, as, one, of, the, major, powers, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, during, that, war, in, 1692, a, venetian, fleet, attempted, to, retake, candia, but, failed, the, last, venetian, strongholds, off, crete, fell, in, the, last, ottoman, venetian, war, in, 1715, crete, would, remain, under, ottoman, control, until, 1897, when, it, became, an, autonomous, state, the, island, continued, under, nominal, ottoman, suzerainty, until, the, balkan, wars, in, their, aftermath, the, ottoman, sultan, dropped, any, claim, on, the, island, and, on, 1, december, 1913, it, was, formally, united, to, greece, following, the, fall, of, candia, fears, rose, that, the, ottomans, would, attack, malta, in, 1670, the, order, of, st, john, began, to, improve, the, island, s, defences, with, the, construction, of, the, cottonera, lines, and, fort, ricasoli
