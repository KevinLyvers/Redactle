invasions, of, burma, between, 1765, and, 1769, which, were, considered, one, of, his, ten, great, campaigns, nonetheless, the, war, which, claimed, the, lives, of, over, 70, 000, chinese, soldiers, and, four, commanders, is, sometimes, described, as, the, most, disastrous, frontier, war, that, the, qing, dynasty, had, ever, waged, and, one, that, assured, burmese, independence, burma, s, successful, defense, laid, the, foundation, for, the, present, day, boundary, between, the, two, countries, at, first, the, qing, emperor, envisaged, an, easy, war, and, sent, in, only, the, green, standard, army, troops, stationed, in, yunnan, the, qing, invasion, came, as, the, majority, of, burmese, forces, were, deployed, in, their, latest, invasion, of, siam, nonetheless, battle, hardened, burmese, troops, defeated, the, first, two, invasions, of, 1765, 1766, and, 1766, 1767, at, the, border, the, regional, conflict, now, escalated, to, a, major, war, that, involved, military, maneuvers, nationwide, in, both, countries, the, third, invasion, 1767, 1768, led, by, the, elite, manchu, bannermen, nearly, succeeded, penetrating, deep, into, central, burma, within, a, few, days, march, from, the, capital, ava, inwa, but, the, bannermen, of, northern, china, could, not, cope, with, unfamiliar, tropical, terrains, and, lethal, endemic, diseases, and, were, driven, back, with, heavy, losses, after, the, close, call, king, hsinbyushin, redeployed, his, armies, from, siam, to, the, chinese, front, the, fourth, and, largest, invasion, got, bogged, down, at, the, frontier, with, the, qing, forces, completely, encircled, a, truce, was, reached, between, the, field, commanders, of, the, two, sides, in, december, 1769, the, qing, kept, a, heavy, military, lineup, in, the, border, areas, of, yunnan, for, about, one, decade, in, an, attempt, to, wage, another, war, while, imposing, a, ban, on, inter, border, trade, for, two, decades, the, burmese, too, were, preoccupied, with, the, chinese, threat, and, kept, a, series, of, garrisons, along, the, border, twenty, years, later, when, burma, and, china, resumed, a, diplomatic, relationship, in, 1790, the, qing, unilaterally, viewed, the, act, as, burmese, submission, and, claimed, victory, ultimately, the, main, beneficiaries, of, this, war, were, the, siamese, who, reclaimed, most, of, their, territories, in, the, next, three, years, after, having, lost, their, capital, ayutthaya, to, the, burmese, in, 1767, the, long, border, between, burma, and, china, had, long, been, vaguely, defined, the, ming, dynasty, first, conquered, yunnan, borderlands, between, 1380, and, 1388, and, stamped, out, local, resistance, by, the, mid, 1440s, the, burmese, control, of, the, shan, states, which, covered, the, present, day, kachin, state, shan, state, and, kayah, state, came, in, 1557, when, king, bayinnaung, of, the, toungoo, dynasty, conquered, all, of, the, shan, states, the, border, was, never, demarcated, in, the, modern, sense, with, local, shan, sawbwas, chiefs, at, the, border, regions, paying, tribute, to, both, sides, the, situation, turned, to, china, s, favor, in, the, 1730s, when, the, qing, dynasty, decided, to, impose, a, tighter, control, of, yunnan, s, border, regions, while, the, burmese, authority, largely, dissipated, with, the, rapid, decline, of, the, toungoo, dynasty, the, qing, attempts, for, tighter, control, of, the, border, were, initially, met, with, fierce, resistance, by, the, local, chiefs, in, 1732, the, yunnan, government, s, demand, of, higher, taxes, led, to, several, shan, revolts, at, the, border, shan, resistance, leaders, united, people, by, saying, the, lands, and, water, are, our, properties, we, could, plow, ourselves, and, eat, our, own, produces, there, is, not, a, need, to, pay, tributes, to, foreign, government, in, july, 1732, a, shan, army, mostly, consisted, of, native, mountaineers, laid, siege, to, the, qing, garrison, at, pu, er, for, 90, days, the, yunnan, government, responded, with, an, overwhelming, force, numbered, around, 5, 000, and, lifted, the, siege, the, qing, army, pursued, further, west, but, could, not, put, down, persistent, local, resistance, finally, the, qing, field, commanders, changed, their, tactics, by, allying, with, neutral, sawbwas, granting, them, qing, titles, and, powers, including, green, standard, captainships, and, regional, commanderships, to, complete, the, agreements, the, third, ranking, officer, of, yunnan, traveled, to, simao, personally, and, held, a, ceremony, of, allegiance, by, the, mid, 1730s, the, sawbwas, of, the, border, who, used, to, pay, dual, tributes, were, increasingly, siding, with, the, more, powerful, qing, by, 1735, the, year, which, the, qianlong, emperor, ascended, the, chinese, throne, ten, sawbwas, had, sided, with, the, qing, the, annexed, border, states, ranged, from, mogaung, and, bhamo, in, present, day, kachin, state, to, hsenwi, state, theinni,

to, the, emperor, in, 1759, and, the, qing, court, promptly, issued, an, imperial, edict, ordering, reconquest, at, first, the, yunnan, officials, who, believed, that, barbarians, must, be, conquered, using, barbarians, tried, to, resolve, the, matter, by, supporting, the, defected, sawbwas, but, the, strategy, did, not, work, in, 1764, a, burmese, army, which, was, on, its, way, to, siam, was, increasing, its, grip, of, the, borderlands, and, the, sawbwas, complained, to, china, in, response, the, emperor, appointed, liu, zao, a, respected, scholarly, minister, from, the, capital, to, sort, out, the, matters, at, kunming, liu, assessed, that, the, use, of, tai, shan, militias, alone, was, not, working, and, that, he, needed, to, commit, regular, green, standard, army, troops, in, early, 1765, a, 20, 000, strong, burmese, army, stationed, at, kengtung, led, by, general, ne, myo, thihapate, left, kengtung, for, yet, another, burmese, invasion, of, siam, with, the, main, burmese, army, gone, liu, zao, used, a, few, minor, trade, disputes, between, local, chinese, and, burmese, merchants, as, the, excuse, to, order, an, invasion, of, kengtung, in, december, 1765, the, invasion, force, which, consisted, of, 3, 500, green, standard, army, troops, along, with, tai, shan, militias, laid, siege, to, kengtung, but, could, not, match, battle, hardened, burmese, troops, at, the,

chinese, assaults, meanwhile, two, burmese, armies, one, led, by, maha, sithu, and, another, led, by, ne, myo, sithu, surrounded, the, chinese, maha, thiha, thura, s, army, also, arrived, and, took, position, near, bhamo, to, block, the, escape, route, back, to, yunnan, the, impasse, did, not, favor, the, chinese, troops, who, were, utterly, unprepared, to, fight, in, the, tropical, weather, of,

garrison, had, died, of, disease, and, that, another, 100, were, ill, with, the, chinese, army, greatly, weakened, the, burmese, then, launched, their, offensive, first, ne, myo, sithu, easily, retook, the, lightly, held, bhamo, the, main, chinese, army, was, now, totally, holed, up, in, the, kaungton, bhamo, corridor, cut, off, from, all, supplies, the, burmese, then, proceeded, to, attack, the, main, chinese, army, from, two, sides, balamindin, s, army, out, of, kaungton, fort, and, ne, myo, sithu, s, army, from, the, north, the, chinese, retreated, eastwards, and, then, northwards, where, another, burmese, army, led, by, maha, thiha, thura, was, waiting, the, two, other, burmese, armies, also, followed, up, and, the, chinese, army, was, destroyed, entirely, maha, sithu, s, army,

order, of, the, emperor, after, the, two, defeats, the, qing, emperor, and, his, court, could, not, comprehend, how, a, relatively, small, country, like, burma, could, resist, the, might, of, the, qing, for, the, emperor, it, was, time, for, the, manchus, themselves, to, come, into, the, picture, he, had, always, doubted, the, battle, worthiness, of, his, chinese, green, standard, armies, the, manchus, saw, themselves, as, a, warlike, and, conquering, race, and, the, chinese, as, an, occupied, people, he, commissioned, a, study, of, the, first, two, invasions, and, the, report, reinforced, his, biases, that, the, low, battle, worthiness, of, the, green, standard, armies, was, the, reason, for, the, failures, in, 1767, the, emperor, appointed, the, veteran, manchu, commander, ming, rui, a, son, in, law, of, his, as, governor, general, of, yunnan, and, guizhou, and, head, of, the, burma, campaign, ming, rui, had, seen, battle, against, turkic, peoples, in, the, northwest, and, was, in, command, of, the, strategically, key, post, of, ili, in, present, day, xinjiang, his, appointment, meant, that, this, was, no, longer, a, border, dispute, but, a, full, fledged, war, ming, rui, arrived, in, yunnan, in, april, an, invasion, force, consisting, of, mongol, and, elite, manchu, troops, rushed, down, from, northern, china, and, manchuria, thousands, of, green, standards, from, yunnan, and, tai, shan, militias, accompanied, this, force, provinces, throughout, china, were, mobilized, to, provide, supplies, the, total, strength, of, the, invasion, force, was, 50, 000, men, the, vast, majority, being, infantry, the, mountains, and, thick, jungles, of, burma, kept, the, use, of, cavalry, forces, to, a, minimum, the, qing, court, now, seriously, considered, the, threat, of, illnesses, among, its, troops, as, a, precaution, the, campaign, was, planned, for, the, winter, months, when, diseases, were, believed, to, be, less, prevalent, the, burmese, now, faced, the, largest, chinese, army, yet, mobilized, against, them, yet, king, hsinbyushin, did, not, seem, to, realize, the, gravity, of, the, situation, throughout, the, first, two, invasions, he, had, steadfastly, refused, to, recall, the, main, burmese, armies, which, had, been, battling, in, laos, and, siam, since, january, 1765, and, laying, siege, to, the, siamese, capital, of, ayutthaya, since, january, 1766, throughout, 1767, when, the, chinese, were, mobilizing, for, their, most, serious, invasion, yet, the, burmese, were, still, focused, on, defeating, the, siamese, even, after, the, siamese, capital, was, finally, captured, in, april, 1767, hsinbyushin, kept, part, of, the, troops, in, siam, during, the, rainy, season, months, in, order, to, mop, up, the, remaining, siamese, resistance, during, the, winter, months, later, that, year, he, actually, allowed, many, shan, and, laotian, battalions, to, demobilize, at, the, start, of, the, rainy, season, as, a, result, when, the, invasion, did, come, in, november, 1767, the, burmese, defenses, had, not, been, upgraded, to, meet, a, much, larger, and, a, more, determined, foe, the, burmese, command, looked, much, like, that, of, the, second, invasion, hsinbyushin, again, assigned, the, same, commanders, of, the, second, invasion, to, face, off, against, the, chinese, maha, sithu, led, the, main, burmese, army, and, was, the, overall, commander, of, the, chinese, theater, with, maha, thiha, thura, and, ne, myo, sithu, commanding, two, other, burmese, armies, balamindin, again, commanded, the, kaungton, fort, given, that, the, main, burmese, army, was, only, about, 7, 000, strong, the, entire, burmese, defense, at, the, start, of, the, third, invasion, was, most, likely, no, more, than, 20, 000, ming, rui, planned, a, two, pronged, invasion, as, soon, as, the, rainy, season, ended, the, main, chinese, army, led, by, ming, rui, himself, was, to, approach, ava, through, hsenwi, lashio, and, hsipaw, and, down, the, namtu, river, the, main, invasion, route, was, the, same, route, followed, by, the, manchu, forces, a, century, earlier, chasing, the, yongli, emperor, of, the, southern, ming, dynasty, the, second, army, led, by, general, e, erdeng, e, or, possibly, was, to, try, the, bhamo, route, again, the, ultimate, objective, was, for, both, armies, to, clamp, themselves, in, a, pincer, action, on, the, burmese, capital, of, ava, the, burmese, plan, was, to, hold, the, second, chinese, army, in, the, north, at, kaungton, with, the, army, led, by, ne, myo, sithu, and, meet, the, main, chinese, army, in, the, northeast, with, two, armies, led, by, maha, sithu, and, maha, thiha, thura, at, first, everything, went, according, to, plan, for, the, qing, the, third, invasion, began, in, november, 1767, as, the, smaller, chinese, army, attacked, and, occupied, bhamo, within, eight, days, ming, rui, s, main, army, occupied, the, shan, states, of, hsenwi, and, hsipaw, ming, rui, made, hsenwi, a, supply, base, and, assigned, 5, 000, troops, to, remain, at, hsenwi, and, guard, the, rear, he, then, led, a, 15, 000, strong, army, in, the, direction, of, ava, in, late, december, at, the, goteik, gorge, south, of, hsipaw, the, two, main, armies, faced, off, and, the, first, major, battle, of, the, third, invasion, ensued, outnumbered, two, to, one, maha, sithu, s, main, burmese, army, was, thoroughly, routed, by, ming, rui, s, bannermen, maha, thiha, thura, too, was, repulsed, at, hsenwi, the, news, of, the, disaster, at, the, goteik, gorge, reached, ava, king, hsinbyushin, finally, realized, the, gravity, of, the, situation, and, urgently, recalled, burmese, armies, from, siam, having, smashed, through, the, main, burmese, army, ming, rui, pressed, on, full, steam, ahead, overrunning, one, town, after, another, and, reached, singu, on, the, irrawaddy, river, 30, miles, north, of, ava, at, the, beginning, of, 1768, the, only, bright, spot, for, the, burmese, was, that, the, northern, invasion, force, which, was, to, come, down, the, irrawaddy, to, join, up, with, ming, rui, s, main, army, had, been, held, off, at, kaungton, at, ava, king, hsinbyushin, famously, did, not, panic, at, the, prospect, of, a, large, chinese, army, numbering, around, 30, 000, men, at, his, doorstep, the, court, urged, the, king, to, flee, but, he, scornfully, refused, saying, he, and, his, brother, princes, sons, of, alaungpaya, would, fight, the, chinese, single, handed, if, they, had, to, instead, of, defending, the, capital, hsinbyushin, calmly, sent, an, army, to, take, up, position, outside, singu, personally, leading, his, men, toward, the, front, line, it, turned, out, that, ming, rui, had, overstretched, himself, and, was, in, no, position, to, proceed, any, farther, he, was, now, too, far, away, from, his, main, supply, base, at, hsenwi, hundreds, of, miles, away, in, the, northern, shan, hills, the, burmese, guerrilla, attacks, on, the, long, supply, lines, across, the, jungles, of, the, shan, hills, were, seriously, hampering, the, qing, army, s, ability, to, proceed, burmese, guerrilla, operations, were, directed, by, general, teingya, minkhaung, a, deputy, of, maha, thiha, thura, ming, rui, now, resorted, to, defensive, tactics, playing, for, time, to, enable, the, northern, army, to, come, to, his, relief, but, it, was, not, to, be, the, northern, army, had, suffered, heavy, casualties, in, their, repeated, attacks, against, the, kaungton, fort, its, commander, e, erdeng, e, against, the, express, orders, of, ming, rui, retreated, back, to, yunnan, the, commander, was, later, publicly, shamed, and, executed, sliced, to, death, on, the, orders, of, the, emperor, the, situation, turned, worse, for, ming, rui, by, early, 1768, battle, hardened, burmese, reinforcements, from, siam, had, begun, to, arrive, back, bolstered, by, the, reinforcements, two, burmese, armies, led, by, maha, thiha, thura, and, ne, myo, sithu, succeeded, in, retaking, hsenwi, the, qing, commander, at, hsenwi, committed, suicide, the, main, qing, army, was, now, cut, off, from, all, supplies, it, was, now, march, 1768, thousands, of, bannermen, from, the, freezing, grasslands, along, the, russian, border, began, dying, of, malaria, as, well, as, burmese, attacks, in, the, furnace, like, hot, weather, of, central, burma, ming, rui, gave, up, all, hope, of, proceeding, toward, ava, and, instead, tried, to, make, it, back, to, yunnan, with, as, many, of, his, soldiers, as, possible, in, march, 1768, ming, rui, began, his, retreat, pursued, by, a, burmese, army, of, 10, 000, infantry, and, 2, 000, cavalry, the, burmese, then, tried, to, encircle, the, chinese, by, splitting, the, army, into, two, maha, thiha, thura, had, now, assumed, the, overall, command, replacing, maha, sithu, the, smaller, army, led, by, maha, sithu, continued, to, pursue, ming, rui, while, the, larger, army, led, by, maha, thiha, thura, advanced, through, the, mountainous, route, to, emerge, directly, behind, the, chinese, through, careful, maneuvering, the, burmese, managed, to, achieve, complete, encirclement, of, the, chinese, at, modern, day, pyin, oo, lwin, maymyo, about, 50, miles, northeast, of, ava, over, the, course, of, three, days, of, bloody, fighting, at, the, battle, of, maymyo, the, bannerman, army, was, completely, annihilated, the, slaughter, was, such, that, the, burmese, could, hardly, grip, their, swords, as, the, hilts, were, slippery, with, enemy, blood, of, the, original, 30, 000, men, of, the, main, army, only, 2, 500, of, then, remained, alive, and, were, captured, the, rest, had, been, killed, either, on, the, battlefield, through, disease, or, through, execution, after, their, surrender, ming, rui, himself, was, severely, wounded, in, battle, only, a, small, group, managed, to, break, through, and, escaped, the, carnage, ming, rui, himself, could, have, escaped, with, that, group, instead, he, cut, off, his, queue, and, sent, it, to, the, emperor, as, a, token, of, his, loyalty, by, those, who, were, escaping, he, then, hanged, himself, on, a, tree, in, the, end, only, a, few, dozen, of, the, main, army, returned, the, qianlong, emperor, had, sent, ming, rui, and, his, bannermen, assuming, an, easy, victory, he, had, begun, making, plans, about, how, he, would, administer, his, newest, territory, for, weeks, the, qing, court, had, heard, nothing, and, then, the, news, finally, came, the, emperor, was, shocked, and, ordered, an, immediate, halt, to, all, military, actions, until, he, could, decide, what, next, to, do, generals, returning, from, the, front, line, cautioned, that, there, was, no, way, burma, could, be, conquered, but, there, was, no, real, choice, but, to, press, on, imperial, prestige, was, at, stake, the, emperor, turned, to, one, of, his, most, trusted, advisers, the, chief, grand, councilor, fuheng, ming, rui, s, uncle, back, in, the, 1750s, fuheng, had, been, one, of, the, few, senior, officials, who, had, fully, backed, the, emperor, s, decision, to, eliminate, the, dzungars, at, a, time, when, most, believed, that, war, was, too, risky, on, 14, april, 1768, the, imperial, court, announced, the, death, of, ming, rui, and, the, appointment, of, fuheng, as, the, new, chief, commander, of, the, burma, campaign, manchu, generals, agui, aligun, and, suhede, were, appointed, as, his, deputies, now, the, top, rung, of, the, qing, military, establishment, prepared, for, a, final, showdown, with, the, burmese, before, any, fighting, resumed, some, on, the, chinese, side, sent, out, peace, feelers, to, the, court, of, ava, the, burmese, also, sent, signals, that, they, would, like, to, give, diplomacy, a, chance, given, their, preoccupations, in, siam, but, the, emperor, with, fuheng, s, encouragement, made, it, clear, that, no, compromise, with, the, burmese, could, be, made, the, dignity, of, the, state, demanded, a, full, surrender, his, aim, was, to, establish, direct, qing, rule, over, all, burmese, possessions, emissaries, were, sent, to, siam, and, laotian, states, informing, them, of, the, chinese, ambition, and, seeking, an, alliance, ava, now, fully, expected, another, major, invasion, king, hsinbyushin, had, now, brought, most, of, the, troops, back, from, siam, to, face, the, chinese, with, the, burmese, fully, preoccupied, with, the, chinese, threat, the, siamese, resistance, retook, ayutthaya, kingdom, in, 1768, and, went, on, to, reconquer, all, of, their, territories, throughout, 1768, and, 1769, for, the, burmese, their, hard, fought, gains, of, the, prior, three, years, 1765, 1767, in, siam, had, gone, to, waste, but, there, was, little, they, could, do, the, survival, of, their, kingdom, was, now, at, stake, fuheng, arrived, in, yunnan, in, april, 1769, to, take, command, of, a, 60, 000, strong, force, he, studied, past, ming, and, mongol, expeditions, to, form, his, battle, plan, which, called, for, a, three, pronged, invasion, via, bhamo, and, the, irrawaddy, river, the, first, army, would, attack, bhamo, and, kaungton, head, on, which, he, knew, would, be, difficult, but, two, other, larger, armies, would, bypass, kaungton, and, march, down, the, irrawaddy, one, on, each, bank, of, the, river, to, ava, the, twin, invading, armies, on, each, side, of, the, river, would, be, accompanied, by, war, boats, manned, by, thousands, of, sailors, from, the, fujian, navy, to, avoid, a, repeat, of, ming, rui, s, mistake, he, was, determined, to, guard, his, supply, and, communication, lines, and, advance, at, a, sustainable, pace, he, avoided, an, invasion, route, through, the, jungles, of, the, shan, hills, so, as, to, minimize, the, burmese, guerrilla, attacks, on, his, supply, lines, he, also, brought, in, a, full, regiment, of, carpenters, who, would, build, fortresses, and, boats, along, the, invasion, route, for, the, burmese, the, overall, objective, was, to, stop, the, enemy, at, the, border, and, prevent, another, chinese, penetration, into, their, heartland, maha, thiha, thura, was, the, overall, commander, the, role, which, he, had, assumed, since, the, second, half, of, the, third, invasion, as, usual, balamindin, commanded, the, kaungton, fort, in, the, last, week, of, september, three, burmese, armies, were, dispatched, to, meet, the, three, chinese, armies, head, on, a, fourth, army, was, organized, with, the, sole, purpose, of, cutting, the, enemy, supply, lines, king, hsinbyushin, had, also, organized, a, flotilla, of, war, boats, to, meet, the, chinese, war, boats, the, burmese, defenses, now, included, french, musketeers, and, gunners, under, the, command, of, pierre, de, milard, governor, of, tabe, who, had, arrived, back, from, the, siamese, theater, based, on, their, troop, movements, the, burmese, knew, at, least, the, general, direction, from, where, the, massive, invasion, force, would, come, maha, thiha, thura, moved, upriver, by, boat, toward, bhamo, as, the, burmese, armies, marched, north, fuheng, against, the, advice, of, his, officers, decided, not, to, wait, until, the, end, of, the, monsoon, season, it, clearly, was, a, calculated, gamble, he, had, wanted, to, strike, before, the, burmese, arrived, but, he, had, also, hoped, that, miasma, would, not, be, everywhere, so, in, october, 1768, towards, the, end, of, but, still, during, the, monsoon, season, fuheng, launched, the, largest, invasion, yet, the, three, chinese, armies, jointly, attacked, and, captured, bhamo, they, proceeded, south, and, built, a, massive, fortress, near, shwenyaungbin, village, 12, miles, east, of, the, burmese, fortress, at, kaungton, as, planned, the, carpenters, duly, built, hundreds, of, war, boats, to, sail, down, the, irrawaddy, but, almost, nothing, went, according, to, plan, one, army, did, cross, over, to, the, western, bank, of, the, irrawaddy, as, planned, but, the, commander, of, that, army, did, not, want, to, march, far, away, from, the, base, when, the, burmese, army, assigned, to, guard, the, west, bank, approached, the, chinese, retreated, back, to, the, east, bank, likewise, the, army, assigned, to, march, down, the, eastern, bank, also, did, not, proceed, this, left, the, chinese, flotilla, exposed, the, burmese, flotilla, came, up, the, river, and, attacked, and, sank, all, the, chinese, boats, the, chinese, armies, now, converged, on, attacking, kaungton, but, for, four, consecutive, weeks, the, burmese, put, up, a, remarkable, defense, withstanding, gallant, charges, by, the, bannermen, to, scale, the, walls, a, little, over, a, month, into, the, invasion, the, entire, qing, invasion, force, was, bogged, down, at, the, border, predictably, many, chinese, soldiers, and, sailors, fell, ill, and, began, to, die, in, large, numbers, fuheng, himself, was, struck, down, by, fever, more, ominously, for, the, chinese, the, burmese, army, sent, to, cut, the, enemy, line, of, communication, also, achieved, its, purpose, and, closed, in, on, the, chinese, armies, from, the, rear, by, early, december, the, chinese, forces, were, completely, encircled, the, burmese, armies, then, attacked, the, chinese, fort, at, shwenyaungbin, which, fell, after, a, fierce, battle, the, fleeing, chinese, troops, fell, back, into, the, pocket, near, kaungton, where, other, chinese, forces, were, stationed, the, chinese, armies, were, now, trapped, inside, the, corridor, between, the, shwenyaungbin, and, kaungton, forts, completely, surrounded, by, rings, of, burmese, forces, the, chinese, command, which, had, already, lost, 20, 000, men, and, a, quantity, of, arms, and, ammunition, now, asked, for, terms, the, burmese, staff, were, averse, to, granting, terms, saying, that, the, chinese, were, surrounded, like, cattle, in, a, pen, they, were, starving, and, in, a, few, days, they, could, be, wiped, out, to, a, man, but, maha, thiha, thura, who, oversaw, the, annihilation, of, ming, rui, s, army, at, the, battle, of, maymyo, in, 1768, realized, that, another, wipe, out, would, merely, stiffen, the, resolve, of, the, chinese, government, maha, thiha, thura, was, said, to, have, said, he, pointed, out, to, his, commanders, that, war, with, the, chinese, was, quickly, becoming, a, cancer, that, would, finally, destroy, the, nation, compared, to, chinese, losses, burmese, losses, were, light, but, considered, in, proportion, to, the, population, they, were, heavy, the, commanders, were, not, convinced, but, maha, thiha, thura, on, his, own, responsibility, and, without, informing, the, king, demanded, that, the, chinese, agree, to, the, following, terms, the, chinese, commanders, decided, to, agree, to, the, terms, at, kaungton, on, 13, december, 1769, or, 22, december, 1769, under, a, 7, roofed, pyathat, hall, 14, burmese, and, 13, chinese, officers, signed, a, peace, treaty, known, as, the, treaty, of, kaungton, the, chinese, burned, their, boats, and, melted, down, their, cannon, two, days, later, as, the, burmese, stood, to, arms, and, looked, down, starved, chinese, soldiers, marched, sullenly, away, up, the, taping, river, valley, they, began, to, perish, of, hunger, by, thousands, in, the, passes, at, beijing, the, qianlong, emperor, was, not, pleased, with, the, treaty, he, did, not, accept, the, chinese, commanders, explanation, that, the, fourth, stipulation, exchange, of, embassies, bearing, presents, amounted, to, burmese, submission, and, tribute, he, did, not, permit, the, surrender, of, the, sawbwas, or, other, fugitives, nor, the, resumption, of, trade, between, the, two, countries, at, ava, king, hsinbyushin, was, furious, that, his, generals, had, acted, without, his, knowledge, and, tore, up, his, copy, of, the, treaty, knowing, that, the, king, was, angry, the, burmese, armies, were, afraid, to, return, to, the, capital, in, january, 1770, they, marched, to, manipur, where, a, rebellion, had, begun, taking, advantage, of, burmese, troubles, with, the, chinese, after, a, three, days, battle, near, langthabal, the, manipuris, were, defeated, and, their, raja, fled, to, assam, the, burmese, raised, their, nominee, to, the, throne, and, returned, the, king, s, anger, had, subsided, after, all, they, had, won, victories, and, preserved, his, throne, still, the, king, sent, maha, thiha, thura, the, decorated, general, whose, daughter, was, married, to, hsinbyushin, s, son, and, heir, apparent, singu, a, woman, s, dress, to, wear, and, exiled, him, and, other, generals, to, the, shan, states, he, would, not, allow, them, to, see, him, he, also, exiled, ministers, who, dared, to, speak, on, their, behalf, although, hostilities, ceased, an, uneasy, truce, ensued, none, of, the, points, in, the, treaty, was, honored, by, both, sides, because, the, chinese, did, not, return, the, sawbwas, the, burmese, did, not, return, the, 2, 500, chinese, prisoners, of, war, who, were, resettled, the, qing, had, lost, some, of, the, generation, s, most, important, frontier, experts, including, yang, yingju, ming, rui, aligun, and, fuheng, who, eventually, died, of, malaria, in, 1770, the, war, cost, the, qing, treasury, 9, 8, million, silver, taels, nonetheless, the, emperor, kept, a, heavy, military, lineup, in, the, border, areas, of, yunnan, for, about, one, decade, in, an, attempt, to, wage, another, war, while, imposing, a, ban, on, inter, border, trade, for, two, decades, the, burmese, for, years, were, preoccupied, with, another, impending, invasion, by, the, chinese, and, kept, a, series, of, garrisons, along, the, border, the, high, casualties, of, the, war, in, terms, of, the, population, size, and, the, ongoing, need, to, guard, the, northern, border, seriously, hampered, the, burmese, military, s, capability, to, renew, warfare, in, siam, it, would, be, another, five, years, when, the, burmese, sent, another, invasion, force, to, siam, it, would, be, another, twenty, years, when, burma, and, china, resumed, a, diplomatic, relationship, in, 1790, the, resumption, was, brokered, by, the, tai, shan, nobles, and, yunnan, officials, who, wanted, to, see, trade, resume, to, the, burmese, then, under, king, bodawpaya, the, resumption, was, on, equal, terms, and, they, considered, the, exchange, of, presents, as, part, of, diplomatic, etiquette, not, as, tribute, to, the, chinese, however, all, of, these, diplomatic, missions, were, considered, tributary, missions, the, emperor, viewed, the, resumption, of, relations, as, burmese, submission, and, unilaterally, claimed, victory, and, included, the, burma, campaign, in, his, list, of, ten, great, campaigns, burma, s, successful, defense, laid, the, foundation, for, the, present, day, boundary, between, the, two, countries, the, border, still, was, not, demarcated, and, the, borderlands, were, still, overlapping, spheres, of, influence, after, the, war, burma, remained, in, possession, of, koshanpye, the, nine, states, above, bhamo, at, least, down, to, the, eve, of, the, first, anglo, burmese, war, in, 1824, the, burmese, exerted, authority, over, the, southern, yunnan, borderlands, as, far, as, kenghung, present, day, jinghong, yunnan, but, chiang, huang, jinghong, of, southern, yunnan, remained, as, authority, of, burma, until, british, occupied, the, whole, burma, in, 1886, likewise, the, chinese, exercised, a, degree, of, control, over, the, borderlands, including, present, day, northeastern, kachin, state, overall, the, burmese, were, able, to, push, back, the, line, of, control, up, to, one, that, existed, before, the, qing, consolidation, drive, of, the, 1730s, however, the, war, also, forced, the, burmese, to, withdraw, from, siam, their, victory, over, the, qing, is, described, as, a, moral, victory, historian, g, e, harvey, writes, their, other, victories, were, over, states, on, their, own, level, such, as, siam, this, was, won, over, an, empire, alaungpaya, s, crusade, against, the, mons, was, stained, with, treachery, the, great, siege, of, ayutthaya, was, a, magnificent, dacoity, though, he, described, the, sino, burmese, war, a, righteous, war, of, defense, against, the, invader, the, main, beneficiaries, of, the, war, were, the, siamese, who, took, full, advantage, of, the, burmese, absence, to, reclaim, their, lost, territories, and, independence, by, 1770, they, had, reconquered, most, of, the, pre, 1765, territories, only, tenasserim, remained, in, burmese, hands, preoccupied, by, the, chinese, threat, and, recovering, from, the, depletion, of, manpower, from, the, war, king, hsinbyushin, left, siam, alone, even, as, siam, continued, to, consolidate, its, gains, he, was, finally, forced, to, send, burmese, armies, to, siam, in, 1775, in, response, to, a, siamese, backed, rebellion, in, lan, na, a, year, earlier, in, the, following, decades, siam, would, become, a, power, in, its, own, right, swallowing, up, lan, na, the, laotian, states, and, parts, of, cambodia, from, a, wider, geopolitical, standpoint, the, qing, and, the, qianlong, emperor, who, hitherto, had, never, faced, defeat, now, had, to, accept, albeit, grudgingly, that, there, were, limits, to, qing, power, a, historian, of, chinese, military, history, marvin, whiting, writes, that, the, burmese, success, probably, saved, the, independence, of, other, states, in, southeast, asia, for, the, qing, the, war, highlighted, limits, to, their, military, power, the, emperor, blamed, the, low, battle, worthiness, of, his, green, standard, armies, for, the, first, two, failed, invasions, but, he, was, to, concede, later, that, his, manchu, bannermen, too, were, less, suited, to, fighting, in, burma, than, in, xinjiang, despite, sending, in, 50, 000, and, 60, 000, troops, in, the, last, two, invasions, the, qing, command, lacked, up, to, date, information, about, invasion, routes, and, had, to, consult, centuries, old, maps, to, form, their, battle, plan, this, unfamiliarity, exposed, their, supply, and, communication, lines, to, repeated, burmese, attacks, and, allowed, their, main, armies, to, be, encircled, in, the, last, three, invasions, the, burmese, scorched, earth, policy, meant, that, the, chinese, were, vulnerable, to, supply, line, cuts, perhaps, most, importantly, the, qing, soldiers, proved, ill, suited, to, fight, in, the, tropical, climate, of, burma, in, the, last, three, invasions, thousands, of, chinese, troops, became, ill, with, malaria, and, other, tropical, diseases, and, many, perished, as, a, result, this, neutralized, the, chinese, advantage, of, superior, numbers, and, allowed, the, burmese, to, engage, the, chinese, armies, head, to, head, towards, the, end, of, the, campaigns, the, war, is, considered, the, peak, of, konbaung, military, power, historian, victor, lieberman, writes, these, near, simultaneous, victories, over, siam, 1767, and, china, 1765, 1769, testified, to, a, truly, astonishing, elan, unmatched, since, bayinnaung, the, burmese, military, proved, that, they, were, able, and, willing, to, take, on, a, far, superior, enemy, using, their, familiarity, with, the, terrain, and, the, weather, to, their, maximum, advantage, the, battle, of, maymyo, is, now, a, military, case, study, of, infantry, fighting, against, a, larger, army, yet, it, proved, that, there, were, limits, to, the, burmese, military, power, the, burmese, learned, that, they, could, not, fight, two, simultaneous, wars, especially, if, one, of, them, was, against, the, world, s, largest, military, king, hsinbyushin, s, reckless, decision, to, fight, a, two, front, war, nearly, cost, the, kingdom, its, independence, moreover, their, losses, while, smaller, than, qing, losses, were, heavy, in, proportion, to, their, much, smaller, size, of, population, hampering, their, military, capability, elsewhere, konbaung, s, military, power, would, plateau, in, the, following, decades, it, made, no, progress, against, siam, its, later, conquests, came, only, against, smaller, kingdoms, to, the, west, arakan, manipur, and, assam
