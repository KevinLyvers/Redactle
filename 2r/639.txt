the, history, of, theatre, charts, the, development, of, theatre, over, the, past, 2, 500, 2, 600, years, while, performative, elements, are, present, in, every, society, it, is, customary, to, acknowledge, a, distinction, between, theatre, as, an, art, form, and, entertainment, and, theatrical, or, performative, elements, in, other, activities, the, history, of, theatre, is, primarily, concerned, with, the, origin, and, subsequent, development, of, the, theatre, as, an, autonomous, activity, since, classical, athens, in, the, 5th, century, bc, vibrant, traditions, of, theatre, have, flourished, in, cultures, across, the, world, there, is, no, conclusive, evidence, that, theater, evolved, from, ritual, despite, the, similarities, between, the, performance, of, ritual, actions, and, theatre, and, the, significance, of, this, relationship, this, similarity, of, early, theatre, to, ritual, is, negatively, attested, by, aristotle, who, in, his, poetics, defined, theatre, in, contrast, to, the, performances, of, sacred, mysteries, theatre, did, not, require, the, spectator, to, fast, drink, the, kykeon, or, march, in, a, procession, however, theatre, did, resemble, the, sacred, mysteries, in, the, sense, that, it, brought, purification, and, healing, to, the, spectator, by, means, of, a, vision, the, theama, the, physical, location, of, such, performances, was, accordingly, named, theatron, according, to, the, historians, oscar, brockett, and, franklin, hildy, rituals, typically, include, elements, that, entertain, or, give, pleasure, such, as, costumes, and, masks, as, well, as, skilled, performers, as, societies, grew, more, complex, these, spectacular, elements, began, to, be, acted, out, under, non, ritualistic, conditions, as, this, occurred, the, first, steps, towards, theatre, as, an, autonomous, activity, were, being, taken, greek, theatre, most, developed, in, athens, is, the, root, of, the, western, tradition, theatre, is, a, word, of, greek, origin, it, was, part, of, a, broader, culture, of, theatricality, and, performance, in, classical, greece, that, included, festivals, religious, rituals, politics, law, athletics, and, gymnastics, music, poetry, weddings, funerals, and, symposia, participation, in, the, city, state, s, many, festivals, and, attendance, at, the, city, dionysia, as, an, audience, member, or, even, as, a, participant, in, the, theatrical, productions, in, particular, was, an, important, part, of, citizenship, civic, participation, also, involved, the, evaluation, of, the, rhetoric, of, orators, evidenced, in, performances, in, the, law, court, or, political, assembly, both, of, which, were, understood, as, analogous, to, the, theatre, and, increasingly, came, to, absorb, its, dramatic, vocabulary, the, theatre, of, ancient, greece, consisted, of, three, types, of, drama, tragedy, comedy, and, the, satyr, play, athenian, tragedy, the, oldest, surviving, form, of, tragedy, is, a, type, of, dance, drama, that, formed, an, important, part, of, the, theatrical, culture, of, the, city, state, having, emerged, sometime, during, the, 6th, century, bc, it, flowered, during, the, 5th, century, bc, from, the, end, of, which, it, began, to, spread, throughout, the, greek, world, and, continued, to, be, popular, until, the, beginning, of, the, hellenistic, period, no, tragedies, from, the, 6th, century, and, only, 32, of, the, more, than, a, thousand, that, were, performed, in, during, the, 5th, century, have, survived, we, have, complete, texts, extant, by, aeschylus, sophocles, and, euripides, the, origins, of, tragedy, remain, obscure, though, by, the, 5th, century, it, was, institutionalised, in, competitions, agon, held, as, part, of, festivities, celebrating, dionysos, the, god, of, wine, and, fertility, as, contestants, in, the, city, dionysia, s, competition, the, most, prestigious, of, the, festivals, to, stage, drama, playwrights, were, required, to, present, a, tetralogy, of, plays, though, the, individual, works, were, not, necessarily, connected, by, story, or, theme, which, usually, consisted, of, three, tragedies, and, one, satyr, play, the, performance, of, tragedies, at, the, city, dionysia, may, have, begun, as, early, as, 534, bc, official, records, didaskaliai, begin, from, 501, bc, when, the, satyr, play, was, introduced, most, athenian, tragedies, dramatise, events, from, greek, mythology, though, the, persians, which, stages, the, persian, response, to, news, of, their, military, defeat, at, the, battle, of, salamis, in, 480, bc, is, the, notable, exception, in, the, surviving, drama, when, aeschylus, won, first, prize, for, it, at, the, city, dionysia, in, 472, bc, he, had, been, writing, tragedies, for, more, than, 25, years, yet, its, tragic, treatment, of, recent, history, is, the, earliest, example, of, drama, to, survive, more, than, 130, years, later, the, philosopher, aristotle, analysed, 5th, century, athenian, tragedy, in, the, oldest, surviving, work, of, dramatic, theory, his, poetics, c, 335, bc, athenian, comedy, is, conventionally, divided, into, three, periods, old, comedy, middle, comedy, and, new, comedy, old, comedy, survives, today, largely, in, the, form, of, the, eleven, surviving, plays, of, aristophanes, while, middle, comedy, is, largely, lost, preserved, only, in, relatively, short, fragments, in, authors, such, as, athenaeus, of, naucratis, new, comedy, is, known, primarily, from, the, substantial, papyrus, fragments, of, plays, by, menander, aristotle, defined, comedy, as, a, representation, of, laughable, people, that, involves, some, kind, of, error, or, ugliness, that, does, not, cause, pain, or, destruction, western, theatre, developed, and, expanded, considerably, under, the, romans, the, roman, historian, livy, wrote, that, the, romans, first, experienced, theatre, in, the, 4th, century, bc, with, a, performance, by, etruscan, actors, beacham, argues, that, romans, had, been, familiar, with, pre, theatrical, practices, for, some, time, before, that, recorded, contact, the, theatre, of, ancient, rome, was, a, thriving, and, diverse, art, form, ranging, from, festival, performances, of, street, theatre, nude, dancing, and, acrobatics, to, the, staging, of, plautus, s, broadly, appealing, situation, comedies, to, the, high, style, verbally, elaborate, tragedies, of, seneca, although, rome, had, a, native, tradition, of, performance, the, hellenization, of, roman, culture, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, had, a, profound, and, energizing, effect, on, roman, theatre, and, encouraged, the, development, of, latin, literature, of, the, highest, quality, for, the, stage, following, the, expansion, of, the, roman, republic, 509, 27, bc, into, several, greek, territories, between, 270, and, 240, bc, rome, encountered, greek, drama, from, the, later, years, of, the, republic, and, by, means, of, the, roman, empire, 27, bc, 476, ad, theatre, spread, west, across, europe, around, the, mediterranean, and, reached, england, roman, theatre, was, more, varied, extensive, and, sophisticated, than, that, of, any, culture, before, it, while, greek, drama, continued, to, be, performed, throughout, the, roman, period, the, year, 240, bc, marks, the, beginning, of, regular, roman, drama, from, the, beginning, of, the, empire, however, interest, in, full, length, drama, declined, in, favour, of, a, broader, variety, of, theatrical, entertainments, the, first, important, works, of, roman, literature, were, the, tragedies, and, comedies, that, livius, andronicus, wrote, from, 240, bc, five, years, later, gnaeus, naevius, also, began, to, write, drama, no, plays, from, either, writer, have, survived, while, both, dramatists, composed, in, both, genres, andronicus, was, most, appreciated, for, his, tragedies, and, naevius, for, his, comedies, their, successors, tended, to, specialise, in, one, or, the, other, which, led, to, a, separation, of, the, subsequent, development, of, each, type, of, drama, by, the, beginning, of, the, 2nd, century, bc, drama, was, firmly, established, in, rome, and, a, guild, of, writers, collegium, poetarum, had, been, formed, the, roman, comedies, that, have, survived, are, all, fabula, palliata, comedies, based, on, greek, subjects, and, come, from, two, dramatists, titus, maccius, plautus, plautus, and, publius, terentius, afer, terence, in, re, working, the, greek, originals, the, roman, comic, dramatists, abolished, the, role, of, the, chorus, in, dividing, the, drama, into, episodes, and, introduced, musical, accompaniment, to, its, dialogue, between, one, third, of, the, dialogue, in, the, comedies, of, plautus, and, two, thirds, in, those, of, terence, the, action, of, all, scenes, is, set, in, the, exterior, location, of, a, street, and, its, complications, often, follow, from, eavesdropping, plautus, the, more, popular, of, the, two, wrote, between, 205, and, 184, bc, and, twenty, of, his, comedies, survive, of, which, his, farces, are, best, known, he, was, admired, for, the, wit, of, his, dialogue, and, his, use, of, a, variety, of, poetic, meters, all, of, the, six, comedies, that, terence, wrote, between, 166, and, 160, bc, have, survived, the, complexity, of, his, plots, in, which, he, often, combined, several, greek, originals, was, sometimes, denounced, but, his, double, plots, enabled, a, sophisticated, presentation, of, contrasting, human, behaviour, no, early, roman, tragedy, survives, though, it, was, highly, regarded, in, its, day, historians, know, of, three, early, tragedians, quintus, ennius, marcus, pacuvius, and, lucius, accius, from, the, time, of, the, empire, the, work, of, two, tragedians, survives, one, is, an, unknown, author, while, the, other, is, the, stoic, philosopher, seneca, nine, of, seneca, s, tragedies, survive, all, of, which, are, fabula, crepidata, tragedies, adapted, from, greek, originals, his, phaedra, for, example, was, based, on, euripides, hippolytus, historians, do, not, know, who, wrote, the, only, extant, example, of, the, fabula, praetexta, tragedies, based, on, roman, subjects, octavia, but, in, former, times, it, was, mistakenly, attributed, to, seneca, due, to, his, appearance, as, a, character, in, the, tragedy, in, contrast, to, ancient, greek, theatre, the, theatre, in, ancient, rome, did, allow, female, performers, while, the, majority, were, employed, for, dancing, and, singing, a, minority, of, actresses, are, known, to, have, performed, speaking, roles, and, there, were, actresses, who, achieved, wealth, fame, and, recognition, for, their, art, such, as, eucharis, dionysia, galeria, copiola, and, fabia, arete, they, also, formed, their, own, acting, guild, the, sociae, mimae, which, was, evidently, quite, wealthy, as, the, western, roman, empire, fell, into, decay, through, the, 4th, and, 5th, centuries, the, seat, of, roman, power, shifted, to, constantinople, and, the, eastern, roman, empire, today, called, the, byzantine, empire, while, surviving, evidence, about, byzantine, theatre, is, slight, existing, records, show, that, miming, scenes, or, recitations, from, tragedies, and, comedies, dances, and, other, entertainments, were, very, popular, constantinople, had, two, theatres, that, were, in, use, as, late, as, the, 5th, century, however, the, true, importance, of, the, byzantines, in, theatrical, history, is, their, preservation, of, many, classical, greek, texts, and, the, compilation, of, a, massive, encyclopedia, called, the, suda, from, which, is, derived, a, large, amount, of, contemporary, information, on, greek, theatre, from, the, 5th, century, western, europe, was, plunged, into, a, period, of, general, disorder, that, lasted, with, a, brief, period, of, stability, under, the, carolingian, empire, in, the, 9th, century, until, the, 10th, century, as, such, most, organized, theatrical, activities, disappeared, in, western, europe, while, it, seems, that, small, nomadic, bands, travelled, around, europe, throughout, the, period, performing, wherever, they, could, find, an, audience, there, is, no, evidence, that, they, produced, anything, but, crude, scenes, these, performers, were, denounced, by, the, church, during, the, dark, ages, as, they, were, viewed, as, dangerous, and, pagan, by, the, early, middle, ages, churches, in, europe, began, staging, dramatized, versions, of, particular, biblical, events, on, specific, days, of, the, year, these, dramatizations, were, included, in, order, to, vivify, annual, celebrations, symbolic, objects, and, actions, vestments, altars, censers, and, pantomime, performed, by, priests, recalled, the, events, which, christian, ritual, celebrates, these, were, extensive, sets, of, visual, signs, that, could, be, used, to, communicate, with, a, largely, illiterate, audience, these, performances, developed, into, liturgical, dramas, the, earliest, of, which, is, the, whom, do, you, seek, quem, quaeritis, easter, trope, dating, from, ca, 925, liturgical, drama, was, sung, responsively, by, two, groups, and, did, not, involve, actors, impersonating, characters, however, sometime, between, 965, and, 975, thelwold, of, winchester, composed, the, regularis, concordia, monastic, agreement, which, contains, a, playlet, complete, with, directions, for, performance, hrosvitha, c, 935, 973, a, canoness, in, northern, germany, wrote, six, plays, modeled, on, terence, s, comedies, but, using, religious, subjects, these, six, plays, abraham, callimachus, dulcitius, gallicanus, paphnutius, and, sapientia, are, the, first, known, plays, composed, by, a, female, dramatist, and, the, first, identifiable, western, dramatic, works, of, the, post, classical, era, they, were, first, published, in, 1501, and, had, considerable, influence, on, religious, and, didactic, plays, of, the, sixteenth, century, hrosvitha, was, followed, by, hildegard, of, bingen, d, 1179, a, benedictine, abbess, who, wrote, a, latin, musical, drama, called, ordo, virtutum, in, 1155, as, the, viking, invasions, ceased, in, the, middle, of, the, 11th, century, liturgical, drama, had, spread, from, russia, to, scandinavia, to, italy, only, in, muslim, occupied, iberian, peninsula, were, liturgical, dramas, not, presented, at, all, despite, the, large, number, of, liturgical, dramas, that, have, survived, from, the, period, many, churches, would, have, only, performed, one, or, two, per, year, and, a, larger, number, never, performed, any, at, all, the, feast, of, fools, was, especially, important, in, the, development, of, comedy, the, festival, inverted, the, status, of, the, lesser, clergy, and, allowed, them, to, ridicule, their, superiors, and, the, routine, of, church, life, sometimes, plays, were, staged, as, part, of, the, occasion, and, a, certain, amount, of, burlesque, and, comedy, crept, into, these, performances, although, comic, episodes, had, to, truly, wait, until, the, separation, of, drama, from, the, liturgy, the, feast, of, fools, undoubtedly, had, a, profound, effect, on, the, development, of, comedy, in, both, religious, and, secular, plays, performance, of, religious, plays, outside, of, the, church, began, sometime, in, the, 12th, century, through, a, traditionally, accepted, process, of, merging, shorter, liturgical, dramas, into, longer, plays, which, were, then, translated, into, vernacular, and, performed, by, laymen, the, mystery, of, adam, 1150, gives, credence, to, this, theory, as, its, detailed, stage, direction, suggest, that, it, was, staged, outdoors, a, number, of, other, plays, from, the, period, survive, including, la, seinte, resurrection, norman, the, play, of, the, magi, kings, spanish, and, sponsus, french, the, importance, of, the, high, middle, ages, in, the, development, of, theatre, was, the, economic, and, political, changes, that, led, to, the, formation, of, guilds, and, the, growth, of, towns, this, would, lead, to, significant, changes, in, the, late, middle, ages, in, the, british, isles, plays, were, produced, in, some, 127, different, towns, during, the, middle, ages, these, vernacular, mystery, plays, were, written, in, cycles, of, a, large, number, of, plays, york, 48, plays, chester, 24, wakefield, 32, and, unknown, 42, a, larger, number, of, plays, survive, from, france, and, germany, in, this, period, and, some, type, of, religious, dramas, were, performed, in, nearly, every, european, country, in, the, late, middle, ages, many, of, these, plays, contained, comedy, devils, villains, and, clowns, the, majority, of, actors, in, these, plays, were, drawn, from, the, local, population, for, example, at, valenciennes, in, 1547, more, than, 100, roles, were, assigned, to, 72, actors, plays, were, staged, on, pageant, wagon, stages, which, were, platforms, mounted, on, wheels, used, to, move, scenery, often, providing, their, own, costumes, amateur, performers, in, england, were, exclusively, male, but, other, countries, had, female, performers, the, platform, stage, which, was, an, unidentified, space, and, not, a, specific, locale, allowed, for, abrupt, changes, in, location, morality, plays, emerged, as, a, distinct, dramatic, form, around, 1400, and, flourished, until, 1550, the, most, interesting, morality, play, is, the, castle, of, perseverance, which, depicts, mankind, s, progress, from, birth, to, death, however, the, most, famous, morality, play, and, perhaps, best, known, medieval, drama, is, everyman, everyman, receives, death, s, summons, struggles, to, escape, and, finally, resigns, himself, to, necessity, along, the, way, he, is, deserted, by, kindred, goods, and, fellowship, only, good, deeds, goes, with, him, to, the, grave, there, were, also, a, number, of, secular, performances, staged, in, the, middle, ages, the, earliest, of, which, is, the, play, of, the, greenwood, by, adam, de, la, halle, in, 1276, it, contains, satirical, scenes, and, folk, material, such, as, faeries, and, other, supernatural, occurrences, farces, also, rose, dramatically, in, popularity, after, the, 13th, century, the, majority, of, these, plays, come, from, france, and, germany, and, are, similar, in, tone, and, form, emphasizing, sex, and, bodily, excretions, the, best, known, playwright, of, farces, is, hans, sachs, 1494, 1576, who, wrote, 198, dramatic, works, in, england, the, second, shepherds, play, of, the, wakefield, cycle, is, the, best, known, early, farce, however, farce, did, not, appear, independently, in, england, until, the, 16th, century, with, the, work, of, john, heywood, 1497, 1580, a, significant, forerunner, of, the, development, of, elizabethan, drama, was, the, chambers, of, rhetoric, in, the, low, countries, these, societies, were, concerned, with, poetry, music, and, drama, and, held, contests, to, see, which, society, could, compose, the, best, drama, in, relation, to, a, question, posed, at, the, end, of, the, late, middle, ages, professional, actors, began, to, appear, in, england, and, europe, richard, iii, and, henry, vii, both, maintained, small, companies, of, professional, actors, their, plays, were, performed, in, the, great, hall, of, a, nobleman, s, residence, often, with, a, raised, platform, at, one, end, for, the, audience, and, a, screen, at, the, other, for, the, actors, also, important, were, mummers, plays, performed, during, the, christmas, season, and, court, masques, these, masques, were, especially, popular, during, the, reign, of, henry, viii, who, had, a, house, of, revels, built, and, an, office, of, revels, established, in, 1545, the, end, of, medieval, drama, came, about, due, to, a, number, of, factors, including, the, weakening, power, of, the, catholic, church, the, protestant, reformation, and, the, banning, of, religious, plays, in, many, countries, elizabeth, i, forbid, all, religious, plays, in, 1558, and, the, great, cycle, plays, had, been, silenced, by, the, 1580s, similarly, religious, plays, were, banned, in, the, netherlands, in, 1539, the, papal, states, in, 1547, and, in, paris, in, 1548, the, abandonment, of, these, plays, destroyed, the, international, theatre, that, had, thereto, existed, and, forced, each, country, to, develop, its, own, form, of, drama, it, also, allowed, dramatists, to, turn, to, secular, subjects, and, the, reviving, interest, in, greek, and, roman, theatre, provided, them, with, the, perfect, opportunity, commedia, dell, arte, lit, comedy, of, the, profession, was, an, early, form, of, professional, theatre, originating, from, italian, theatre, that, was, popular, throughout, europe, between, the, 16th, and, 18th, centuries, it, was, formerly, called, italian, comedy, in, english, and, is, also, known, as, commedia, alla, maschera, commedia, improvviso, and, commedia, dell, arte, all, improvviso, characterized, by, masked, types, commedia, was, responsible, for, the, rise, of, actresses, such, as, isabella, andreini, and, improvised, performances, based, on, sketches, or, scenarios, a, commedia, such, as, the, tooth, puller, is, both, scripted, and, improvised, characters, entrances, and, exits, are, scripted, a, special, characteristic, of, commedia, is, the, lazzo, a, joke, or, something, foolish, or, witty, usually, well, known, to, the, performers, and, to, some, extent, a, scripted, routine, another, characteristic, of, commedia, is, pantomime, which, is, mostly, used, by, the, character, arlecchino, now, better, known, as, harlequin, the, characters, of, the, commedia, usually, represent, fixed, social, types, and, stock, characters, such, as, foolish, old, men, devious, servants, or, military, officers, full, of, false, bravado, the, characters, are, exaggerated, real, characters, such, as, a, know, it, all, doctor, called, il, dottore, a, greedy, old, man, called, pantalone, or, a, perfect, relationship, like, the, innamorati, many, troupes, were, formed, to, perform, commedia, including, i, gelosi, which, had, actors, such, as, andreini, and, her, husband, francesco, andreini, confidenti, troupe, desioi, troupe, and, fedeli, troupe, commedia, was, often, performed, outside, on, platforms, or, in, popular, areas, such, as, a, piazza, town, square, the, form, of, theatre, originated, in, italy, but, travelled, throughout, europe, sometimes, to, as, far, away, as, moscow, the, genesis, of, commedia, may, be, related, to, carnival, in, venice, where, the, author, and, actor, andrea, calmo, had, created, the, character, il, magnifico, the, precursor, to, the, vecchio, old, man, pantalone, by, 1570, in, the, flaminio, scala, scenario, for, example, il, magnifico, persists, and, is, interchangeable, with, pantalone, into, the, 17th, century, while, calmo, s, characters, which, also, included, the, spanish, capitano, and, a, dottore, type, were, not, masked, it, is, uncertain, at, what, point, the, characters, donned, the, mask, however, the, connection, to, carnival, the, period, between, epiphany, and, ash, wednesday, would, suggest, that, masking, was, a, convention, of, carnival, and, was, applied, at, some, point, the, tradition, in, northern, italy, is, centred, in, florence, mantua, and, venice, where, the, major, companies, came, under, the, protection, of, the, various, dukes, concomitantly, a, neapolitan, tradition, emerged, in, the, south, and, featured, the, prominent, stage, figure, pulcinella, which, has, been, long, associated, with, naples, and, derived, into, various, types, elsewhere, most, famously, as, the, puppet, character, punch, of, the, eponymous, punch, and, judy, shows, in, england, the, commedia, dell, arte, allowed, professional, women, to, perform, early, on, lucrezia, di, siena, whose, name, is, on, a, contract, of, actors, from, 1564, has, been, referred, to, as, the, first, italian, actress, known, by, name, with, vincenza, armani, and, barbara, flaminia, as, the, first, primadonna, and, the, well, documented, actresses, in, europe, english, renaissance, theatre, derived, from, several, medieval, theatre, traditions, such, as, the, mystery, plays, that, formed, a, part, of, religious, festivals, in, england, and, other, parts, of, europe, during, the, middle, ages, other, sources, include, the, morality, plays, and, the, university, drama, that, attempted, to, recreate, athenian, tragedy, the, italian, tradition, of, commedia, dell, arte, as, well, as, the, elaborate, masques, frequently, presented, at, court, also, contributed, to, the, shaping, of, public, theatre, since, before, the, reign, of, elizabeth, i, companies, of, players, were, attached, to, households, of, leading, aristocrats, and, performed, secular, pieces, seasonally, in, various, locations, these, became, the, foundation, for, the, professional, players, that, performed, on, the, elizabethan, stage, the, tours, of, these, players, gradually, replaced, the, performances, of, the, mystery, and, morality, plays, by, local, players, a, 1572, law, eliminated, any, unlicensed, companies, lacking, formal, patronage, by, labelling, them, vagabonds, the, city, of, london, authorities, were, generally, hostile, to, public, performances, but, its, hostility, was, overmatched, by, the, queen, s, taste, for, plays, and, the, privy, council, s, support, theatres, sprang, up, in, suburbs, especially, in, the, liberty, of, southwark, accessible, across, the, thames, to, city, dwellers, but, beyond, the, authorities, control, the, companies, maintained, the, pretence, that, their, public, performances, were, mere, rehearsals, for, the, frequent, performances, before, the, queen, but, while, the, latter, did, grant, prestige, the, former, were, the, real, source, of, the, income, for, the, professional, players, along, with, the, economics, of, the, profession, the, character, of, the, drama, changed, toward, the, end, of, the, period, under, elizabeth, the, drama,

and, 1850, neoclassical, philosophy, almost, completely, passed, away, under, romanticism, which, was, a, great, influence, of, 19th, century, american, theatre, that, idolized, the, noble, savage,
